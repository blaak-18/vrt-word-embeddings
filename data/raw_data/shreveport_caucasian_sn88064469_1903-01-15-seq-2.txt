double row of fancy buttons accentuates
the style. The revers are made of white
satin and are covered with application

heavier than Irish point and is much
more showy. It stands up above the

to the hearts of nIiny aiv titrne Iov
hig Auiericas. for they s:«" a prospett
of once moire engaging in the exeitilg
enterprises which ha1( bee1n their por
tion during the Spanish wlr.
Amnong this number was young W:ight,
who began a zealous (m1!aign to dis
cover the whereahouts of .1imiinez. Ie
finally succeeded in trllekulig him to his
hiding place and. upon obtaining an in
terview. was astonished to learn that
Jiminez was no other than the man
who had been making so much use of
his news bureau.
Jiminez gave him a cordial reception,
but poiateu out to him the fact that It
was not at all likely the revolution
would be productive of either money or
glory for those concerned in it and that
the only one vitally interested in its
success was himself. Wright. however,
was insistent and finally obtained the
ex-president's permission to accompany
him as a war correspondent.
The next day saw the news bureau
closed and the youthful Hoosier en
route to the designated port for the
secret embarkation of the revolution
iats. To his disgust, the boat on which
they sailed was Intercepted by an
American gunboat, and though Jimi
nes and his fellow countrymen were
promptly released the Americans
among the party were detained until
orders came from General Wood to
free them also.
As luck would have it, the expedi
tion after resuming its start call&d at
a port the name of which Jiminea con
veyed to Wright by a trusted messen
ger. The reporter at once hurried there,
arriving just in time to become once
more a revolutionist. Santo Domingo
/./
' w.. 'WIGHt.
was now reached without any trouble,
and in short order Jiminez won the
day and had the satisfaction of hear
ing himself proclaimed president of the
republic.
Wright had been of great help to
him throughout the campaign, and the
victorious general was not ungrateful.
He decided to show his gratitude by
naming the American as general in
chief of all the Dominican army. When
Wright learned, however, that this
army consisted of an undisciplined rub
ble of 4.000 colored troops, armed with
guns of an antique pattern, he respect
fully but firmly declined the honor.
Jimines then d. - mined to make
him prime minister, taut warned him
that all he could expect wherewith to
maintain the dignity of his high posi
tion w as a salary of $300 a year. Prime
minister Wright became, and got his
salary, too. although Jiminez had to
borrow the money from a friend.
A year had not passed before Jimi
nes ordered the premier to Washing
ton on a secret and important mission
to sound the American state depart
ment on the question of its extending
protection to the reigning government
against internal enemies. Wright had
scarcely begun his diplomatic task
when the government of Santo Domin
gp was uncejnore overturned and Jimi
as compelled to See for his life.

the fact that Chancellor Von Buelow

President Roosevelt, it is reported
here, two months ago expressed his
