U PIBLIC OPIINION
Reflected in the Papers of this
Great State.
Although William Jennings Bryan
failed in his election as President
of the United States, he still re
tains his position as executive offi
cer of a great commercial organiza
tion, which is second only in im
portance to the National Congress.
This is the Trans-Mississippi Com
mercial Congress, which -will hold
its ninth annual session in Salt Lake
City, Utah, July 14, of this year.
It will be a notable gathering of
Western statesmen and will com
prise governors and ex-governors,
present members and ex-members
of the National Congress, and the
most prominent and influential men
of the trans-missisFippian territory
to the number of one thousand, ex
clusive of the ladies who are ex
pected to accompany them. -Crow
'ley Signal, Ind.
It seems that cold and unadul
terated imagination is doing all
that is being done for the commer
cial condition of the country. A
causual glance over the field very
plainly shows that the Republicans
have got all that they asked for
now and cannot do any more with
it than the Democrats could. It is
only the satisfaction among the
millionaire Republican manufac
turers that class legislation will
come sooner or later that is mark
ing the business for the country
to-day.--Franklin News, Rep.
A revolution is bound to come.
The only hope for the future is that
it may simply be a peaceful revolu
tion at the ballot box. It would be
better for Elkins, Hanna, Quay,
Platt & Co., to keep quiet about
reducing wages and go slow in ar
ranging a tariff that will protect
and foster trusts, and at the same
time add to the burdens of the
laboring classes by increasing the
price of their food and clothing.
Decreasing wages on the one hand,
and increasing the cost of living on
the other, seems to be the policy of
the Republican leaders. The peo
ple will give their answer at the
polls.-Bossier Banner, Dem.
There are people in this country
who believe that popular govern
ment is a failure. The fact is they
had their predecessors years since.
With them popular government was
a failure because they wanted it so.
Popular government interfered with
their ends, aims and ambitions.
They were aristocrats with love of
place and rower. They repre
sented a small per cent of the peo
ple then, as now, but the relative
position of the two-the thens and
the nows-are quite the reverse.
The aristocrat of former days
longed for power, but had scruples
that interfered with the attainment
of it. The aristocrat of to-day is
no longer a sighing dreamer, but a
triumphant, proud and arrogant
possessor. He no longer questions
popular government, for it lies al
most a wreck at his feet. Forms,
statutes and constitutions still ex
ist, but their interpretation and
execution are in his hands and the
people are slowly and surely finding
it out. It is an interesting situa
tion.-Bossier Banner, Dem.
We are glad to note that a move
ment is on foot in Virginia to se
cure the erection of a million dollar
monument to the memory of the
late President Davis. The South
owes it to the memory of her illus
trious son, who devoted his great
abilities and his life for a long
series of years to the advancement
of her interests, to erect a monu
ment to his memory which in mag
nificence shall surpass anything of
that nature ever before attempted
by man. Such a monument be but
a small tax upon our chivalrous
people, and in view of the fact that
during his life Mr. Davis was made
the target for the venom and ma
lignity of all the enemies of the
South our people should perpetuate
his memory by some fitting testi
monial of the esteem and admira
tion in which his memory is held
by a great and loyal people. The
proposition for a monument that
shall surpass in sublimity that re
cently erected to Grant should
meet with an enthusiastic responsel
on the part of every true South
erner. - Baton Rouge Advocate,
Dem.
The Louisiana pap-sucking con
tingent at Washington is growing
awfully tired as the days grow into
weeks, the weeks into months and
still no prospect for an immediate
admission to the apartments where
the swill is kept. Some of these
poor fellows have already had their
patience and their credit worn
threadbare and unless office comes
to them speedily they will be com
pelled to "'take to the pike" in or
der to get home. However, walk
ing is now pretty good and if it
takes them until the "possums get
ripe and the 'simmons' gin to fall"
to get home we suppose it will be
all right. In a month or so we look
for a whole Coxey's army of Louis
iana Republicans to take up the
line of march from Washington,
when woe be unto the hen roosts
along the route of the retreatmng
braves ! - Baton Rouge Advocate,
Dem.
In the constitutional convention
who will rule, the people or the
politicians? If the good citizens
of the towns and cities will stop
long enough to think, they will
throw their influence with those of
the country, who usually do think
and seriously too, the people will,
and our State will get a good fun
damental law; something in keep
ing with our moral and business
standing. But if the politicians
control, then only a grotesque, hid
eous, political deformity may be
expected. - Sherveport Progress,
Dem.
This is a bad year for the trusts
in this country. The steel rail
trust first went to pieces and was
soon followed by the dissolution of
the steel beam trust. The Federal
Circuit Court of Illinois has issued
an order prohibiting the Tobacco
Trust doing business in that State,
the legislature has defeated the bills
of the Chicago Gas Trust and the
officials of the Sugar Trust are in a
fair way of going to jail for con
tempt. Aside trom this the latter
have abandoned all hope of getting
the sugar schedule which they dic
tated retained in the tariff bill, and
are now striving hard to make terms
with their opponents. Ex-Senator
Ingalls spoke words of truth when
he said that train robbing is repect
able compared to the brazen at
tempt of the sugar trust to plunder
the whole country, and if its sugar
schedule is allowed to stand it will
mean the death of the Rupublican
party at the next national election.
