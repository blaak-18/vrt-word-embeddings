The following reports were rec iv
ed and adopted:
I. Report on Churches and Parson
ages by 1Rev. (i. M. Liverman.
NATCHlSOC'HEn, LA., Sept. 1, ISnO.
We, your committee on Churches
and Parsonages beg leave to submit
the following report: After compil
ing the report of the stations, circuits
and mission composing Shreveport
District, we find thirty-four houses
of worship on the District with 28150
sittings. Titles are all well secured
and recorded as the law requires.
Two thousand eight hundred and
eleven dollars and ton cents have
been collected for church buildings
and repairs this year. While Natbch.
itoches, Coushatta, Mansfield and
Keachie can boast of nice church
editices, some circuits do not even
report a lot deeded to the church for
the erection of a house or houses of
worship. Per reports from the va
rious works there are only six par.
sonages in the District and one or
two of them not in a very good con
dition and poorly furnished. In one
instance we find a full outllt for
Parsonage and no house. This, under
the circumstances, is unavoidable
and no one is to blame but to the
contrary commendable. We your
committee do not feel justified in
closing this report without calling
your attention to the deftlicieny in
number of houses of worship to ccm
parison to the number of church or
ganizations reported. This in our
judgement ought to be remedied as
soon as possible. It is our belief
that no church organization can ex.
long and be instrumental of much
rood that is not permanently dom
cled in the community.
Therefore, we your committee
would submit the following resolu
tions:
let. Resolved, That it is the sense
and desire of this Conference that
Preachers and Laymen take steps
Immediately to secure lots by deed
In every community where we have
organization and no house of divine
worshia
td Resolved, That in building
church houses we should as near as
possible follow the plan or plans
given in Patterson's Manauel of Ar
ehIteetare which can be had at our
publishing house ian ashvllleTenn.,
and recommendled by Bishop Mar
vin.
3d. Resolved, That Pastors be reo
auested to secure lots of land by
deed on their respective workq on
wbhteh to bujlid a parsonage wlere
none exist.
All of which is submitted.
O. M. LINERMAN,
Chairman of Committee.
REPORT ON nODUCATION.
Your committei Ta glad to report
that the subject of education is one
olf general interest throughout our
Distrit. New schools 'have been
cammeaneed and old ones are flour
ishinar. We have only one Metho.
dist lnstitution, the Mansfield Foe
male ollege. Rev. Theeo, Arms
strong reesped his position last
June, andane some delay the board
of managers have secured the ser
vies of brother J. Lane Borden.
Brother Borden is a teacher of ex
perienee and of fine eduoational
quaillostion. Although he has had
buat little thlme to work since his ac_
eptance the proespeets are brighter
and everything points to a suceses
frul, prosperots session. Although
the~bllege is, properly speaking, lth
property of the entire Annual Con
forence still in consequence of the
present lack of eommaunietion its
entlre support must come from our
District. Therefore, it is inceumbent
on us to do our beet for it. If we sup.
port It, it will flourish, but if we hold
aloof or give it a falint support it
must go down and Methodlism will
be put back a generatlion in our Dis
triot. We offer the followlIg resoln
1st. Resolved, That we pledge our

To the preoiding Elder, and menmbers

Br.rn tn: Your committeo to whom
was referred the spiritual state of the
church beg leave to report, that when
we survey the broad fields of Moth.
odism with its millions of members,
Its ponderous machinery, its daily
increasing membership on every I-:l
land ~ini continent of the world, we
have reason for profound gratitude
to Almighty (led, and at the same
time have reasons to fear lost we
should unt act worthy of the blos.
sings a Rind Providence has extend,
to us, to e'ar, lent we look more to
numbers, and financial strongth
than to The spiritual welfare of our
zion. And while the glad tidings of
success and vietory, is being borne
upon every breeze from all quarters
of the globe, our own district has not
been idle, hblt 1h nobly and success
fully pressing onward, and hearing
her part in the granl work of the
world's redemptiotan.
Under the devotion, zeal, energy,
ability and self denial of our preach.
era, we have received during the
four years past 1750 members, and
have had fully that number of con.
versions. All over the distrlet new
houses of worsbip, parsonages and
campgrounds are being built, and
much lnterest is being manifested in
our church by those from without.
We have in this district 202' morn
bers and have had, this year, 1rt ac
cessions, and 124 conversions; 45 in
fants have been Iaptized. 9.) per
cent of the members take roommu
alon,
There are ,o00 persons preached to
on the district by our preachors.
About 20 per ent of the headsof
families hold family worship.
Trhe attondence upon public wor
ship I unusually good, Outr prayer
meetings. 1s; in number, are well at.
tended. Only 5 regularly organized
class meetinsa have been reported.
Our tmembers, with Bomo ex
ceptions, are orderly and conosin
tent, but yet there Is much room tfor
improvoment, a need of holler lihes
and a more orderlty walk. The above
figures show a considerable increase
in our ranks and we think conslde
rable growth in spirituality, andt
could we have had reports from all
the circuits and stations in the dis
trict, we have no doubt that our ri
port would have been more gratify.
lg to those who feel an Interest in
the church. Five of our circuits and
stations.have not been heard from,
andamong them somne of our most
important works.
Breothren, loet us take courage and
return to our respective fields of la.
bor with renewed energy and -eal
for the master's cause, more fully dI.
termined to live above reproach and
to work more faithfully for the sahva
ties of souls.
I~e iveod that we will endeavor by
al posasible means to elevate the
stadard of religion and urge our
people on to a higher state in the
divine life.
With deep and profound gratitude
to the great head of the church for
his goodness and continued mercies
