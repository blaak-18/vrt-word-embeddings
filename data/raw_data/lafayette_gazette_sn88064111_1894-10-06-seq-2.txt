SAN OBJECT LESSON.
SAn object lesson of the benefi
t effects of the Wilson tariff law
a brought under our observation
t week. In the ancitement at
the sudden bolt of a large
irmber of sugar planters and the
demoralization occasioned by the
--rbard times pictured to the people
 ly designing men, whose sole object
a m. to break up the solid party or
anization in this State, many per
* sons completely lost sight of the
kct that there were many clauses
:An the tariff bill, besides that affect
;"1ng sugar, in which the people were
interested. We thought so luch
about sugar, that it was sugar first,
last and always. The sugar planters
made so much noise that we had
forgotten that there was such a
thing in the country as a rice
.rplanter. But now that the second
sober thought has made itself felt,
we are beginning ,p take a more
sensible view of the situation. We
'Eýin to see that sugar cane, if the
r efineries do the right thing, will
bring a fair price, and with a little
reflection the thought strikes the
thinking man that much good must
inevitably result from the tariffreduc
tions of the Wilson bill. In a con
versation with an intelligent farmer
"The Gazette obtained the informa
tion that in the way of farming
implements the prices were already
considerably reduced. Another
thrifty and intelligent tiller of soil,
who owns a rice farm near Scott
showed us the diffe.mnce in the
costs of bagging a n ties used in
the shipping of his crop. Last year
for zooo sacks with ties he paid $ 12
andt this year, thanks to the Wilson
bill, he paid $52.
Here is a saving to one farmer,
on two items, of $6o, which under
the McKinley bill, would have gone
into the coffers of the manufac
turers. Three years ago 55ooo
sacks of rice were shipped from
Duson station; taking the above
mentioned case as a basis and after
a rough estimate, we find that the
handsome sum of $3300 would
have remained in the pockets of the
farmers of that section had the
Wilson bill been in existence at
that time.
LET IT LE A WHIITE
MANV'S AFFAIR.
We learn from the New Orleans
papers that a plan has been sug
gested and is under consideration
by leaders of both the Democratic
and national Republican parties in
thiis district by which it is proposed
to have a white primary to choose
a candidate for Congress. No
:question as to party affiliations or
preferences are to be asked, but
white men of all parties are to be
allowed to vote, and the voter .is
set expected to support the can
didate, .but he simply binds himself
not'to vote against him. This is
eminently fair and if the boast of
4te holters that they want to elim
inate the negro from politics is sin
Scere, they will agree to this propo
s.italbn. With white primary the
segro--the turbulent, obnoxious
-a.d dangerous factor-is left out,
-altd the question is to be decided
Sby the.white people. If a majority
dtsre that a Republican represent
.- si Congress, let their wish pre
,ail. But, if a majority of the
white voters favor the election of a
iDemoc-rat, the negro should not,
'.uid sunless we are very much mis
aken, will not, hold the balance of
er, thereby defeating the will of
i.telligent nd tax-paying part
the populatlaa . If Judge Beattie,
rd'ech'icbic is as much op
t.a -nearo supremacy as his

First Ward Democrats iu Line.
Quite an enthusiastic meeting was held at
Scott Saturday evening. The chairman, Mr.
A. Delhomme, in an eloquent and patri>tic
address.statoed the object of the meeting and
counseled harmony and unity in the coming
c gressionalcampaign. S. Begneaud anl P.
O. Richards were appointed as delegates to
the Democratic congressional convention.
The following resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
'"Resolved by the' Democracy of the
first ward of Lafayette parish in mass
meeting assembled. z. We reaffirm oar al
legiance to the Democratic party, na
tional and State. 2. We view wth profound
regret the withdrawal of some of our
party friends from the folds of the only
party which ever attempted and finally
succeeded in rescuing Louisiana from the
untold horrors of negro domination, and
that we earnestly hope when the sober
second thought which ever on the judg-.
meat waits shall come and reason shall
resume its sway that our late friends will
hesitate on the brink before they plunge
into the abyss of demoralization which
their course will inevitably create. That
we are profoundly impressed with the
fact that it it suicidal for the white people
of this State to divide on econmic
questions and thereby throw the balance
of power into the hands of the venal,
purchasable negro vaie. That we view
with profound astonisfent the spectacle
of a love feast between white ex-Demo
crats. and vultures of the reconstruction
period.
'3. Resolved, That we fully indorse the
course of our Senators and extend to them our
hearty thanks for their efforts in behalf of our
State.
"4. That we extend thanks to the na
tional Democracy for their efforts to cheapen
the cost of living for the poor man. That
we appreciate the action of the I-louse on the
sugar question but as a rebuke to the infa
mous Sugar Trust. That we confidently
hope provision will be nade to pay the
bounty this year, and for this year only, that
their efforts will re-establish the Democratic
principles.
"'. That our delegates to the convention
of Oct. 3 be uninstructed excepted in so
fair as to vote for no man for nominee . who
will not stand 'by the caucus action in
the reorganization of the House of Repres
entative.
"'6. That we will call upon all true Demo
crats in the parish of Lafayette, regardless
of past factional defference, to conie together
and make a united and determined tight
against a common enemy, the Republican
party. 4
*Rosveled, That a copy of these reso
lutions be furnished the Picayune and Times
Democrat, the Lafayette Gazette and
Lafayette Advertiser.

An interesting letter each week,
frem Totodem Verbis giving a nice
description of the northwestern por
tion of our parish induces me to say
somnething atout the northeastern
portion. Having many friends in
and about beautiful Carencro, I
know that Totidem Vervis does nt
exagerate in the least. It is doubt
ful which is the richest land, there
or here. It is about alike all over
the parish, but the eastern portiotn
is higher and drains better than
this; it is more suitable to the cul
tivation of cotton and cane wi.ile
rice is our money crop. Dusotn is
our town, and though not as large
as New Orleans it is quite a little
village with live, enterprising iilhab
itants. Three years since we
shipped 55,000 sacks of rice and
expect to ship more than half that
much this year. There is a large
amount of cotton raised here, but
for want of a gin we will have to
haul it to Rayne and Scott. A gin
here this year would have passed
over 40oo bales. This is a good
opportunity for an enterprising man
with a small capital.
_As local news is always interest
ing, I will tell your many readers
how we live here: fine fat beef at
5 cents a pound; pork at 7 cents,
corn 50 cents per barrel, eggs 15
cents per dozen, large chickens 20
cents a piece, rice potatoes, vege
tables of all kinds we raise in abun
dance.
Two of our young couples are
matrimoniously inclined: Mr: Jno.
Hoffpauir will marry Miss Clara
Foreman next Thursday at Solo
mon Mo rgan's, and Thu omas
Hoffpauir will wed Miss Cora Mc
Coy at Silas HIoffpauir's Thursday
week. There are one or two more
couples who are acting suspiciously
and it is feared that they also con
template matrimony.
I think those sugar planters are
making a bad move to join the Re
publicans. They must have for
gotten what Louisiana was a few
years ago under Warmnoth, Pinch
back & Co. No Republicanism
for mne; Democracy forever. This
move will not amount to much as
the white people will in a majority I
and they will never consent to a re
turn of negro rule. 1Vith nmaiy
good wishes for Our Gazette, I am,
OBERON.
Miss Alice Catlin is the populist
candidate for school superintendent

The Scott affair is only second in
importance to the Hawaiian muiddle.
It furnished an opportunity to our I
local deplomats to display their
abilities.
Saturday afternoon the Daily
Free Press of this city announced
its withdrawal -from the field of
daily journalism. It states, how
ever, that it will continue hereafter
a weekly Sunday paper, unde' the
same name and in advocacy of the
same sound Democratic doctrines
that it so well and ably stood by
heretofore. We sincere s regret

that olr confrere will fihd tn the
publication of a ringing weekly

unfavorable circumstances and an
overcrowded field, he failed to
make of the Free Press as a daily
States.
Beattie is not making much noise.
But wait for the Democrats.
The resolutions adopted by the
Scott meeting have the true Demo
cratic ring. We don't know, but
it strikes us that they bear the ear
marks of Dr. Fred Mayer, one of
the popular leaders of the great un
terrified Democracy of the third
ward.
In an editorial that appeared in
yesterday's Times-Dem crat, com
menting on the statement of the St.
Louis Republic that the Hon. An
drtw Price, Congressman trom the
third district of this State, was a
native of Missouri, we took occasion
to say that while to Missouri be
longed the honor of being the birth
place of so distinguished a gentle
man, that it was for Louisiana's in
terests he had given his best efforts.
Since this publication we lean that
the Republic was mistaken in claim
ing so enviable a distinction for
Missouri, and that Mr. Price was
born, as were his mother and mater
nal grandfather, at the old homested
on Bayou Teche, about a nale from
Franklin in St. Mary parish. Thus
Louisiana enjoys the privilege of
being not only the Congressman's
present home, but of his birthplace
also.-Tim es-Demrnocrat
