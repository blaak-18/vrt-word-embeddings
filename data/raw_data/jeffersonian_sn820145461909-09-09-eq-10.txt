What Our Farmers Are Say
ing and Doing
IRISH POTATOES.
That the American crop of Irish
potatoes averages 75 bushels, while
the crop in Prussia averages 400
bushels, is worth considering, accord
ing to Farm and Ranch. Germans
have made their soils richer, while
ours are being exhausted. A differ
ence of 325 bushels per acre will well
repay cost of manures, and of cul
tural methods. Those Germans are
scientific, which means that they
farm with knowledge of needs of
soils, and supply the needs.
TERRAPIN FARMING.
Whoever heard of raising terra
pins as a business? But it is done,
says Up-to-Date Farming. We know
of at least two terrapin farms in the
United States. One of them is in
Maryland and the other is in Alabama
near Mobile. The Alabama farm is
surrounded by a fence so tight that
even the smallest terrapin can not
escape, and canals are cut through
the land, the earth from them being
piled up and forming dry ridges be
tween. The supply comes from the
coast, and fishermen are constantly
employed hunting them. They are
said to breed as rapidly in the en
closure as on the coast in their na
tive haunts. Many thousands are
kept constantly on hand, and it is
said from ten to twelve thousand
dozens are sold annually at prices
of from $6 to $lO per dozen. New
'ork and Philadelphia are the prin
cipal markets, and from these points
the general trade is supplied.
These strange creatures are fed
regularly by their keepers, and it is
a wonderful sight to see the thou
sands of them struggling up the
banks to get their food. Most restau
rants in the cities serve turtle soup
and charge high prices for it, but it
is very seldom real terrapin soup be
cause of the scarcity and high price
of terrapins.
TOADS AS BUG CATCHERS.
As high as $25 a hundred is some
times paid for live toads by English
and French gardeners. The toad is
a highly appreciated personage in for
eign gardens. Shelters are made for
the toads—shallow holes in the
ground covered with flat stones or
boards. The toads will retire into
these in the day time and come forth
at dusk for their nightly insect
forays.
Professor Hodge, of Clark Univer
sity, estimated that every time the
farmer’s boy killed a toad he was
destroying $2 0 worth of stock on the
farm. —Southern Agriculturist.
BUFFALO RANCH TO BE MOVED
TO OLD MEXICO.
Captain Charles Goodnight and Dr.
Charles Young have purchased a tract
of 875,000 acres in Old Mexico, and
the famous Goodnight herd of buffalo
and the cattle of crosses between the
buffalo and cattle will be transferred
from the Panhandle ranch to the new
ocation. The Panhadle ranch will
be cut up for farming tracts.
For more than a quarter of a cen
tury Captain Goodnight has been rais
ing buffalo and cattle, and he is prob
ably the greatest living authority on
the buffalo. The development of the
West Texas country has made land
too valuable to be used for grazing
purposes; so the herd is being moved
to a leess deeveloped country.
The Mexico ranch was a part of the
General Geronimo Trevino ranch of
two million acres and is along the
Rio Grande, a part being opposite Del
Rio. —Texas Stockman-Journal.
SOWING TURNIPS.
We are fearful that the rainy sea
son will prevent many of our farmers
from sowing their stubble lands in
peas as they should have done. If so,
and if not, still we want to impress
upon our farmers the necessity of
tsbe 3effersonlan
sowing a large area in turnips. They
come in at a time when the farmer
needs succulent food for himself and
his live stock. Os all the turnips the
Ruta Baga is best; it is most nutri
tious and keeps better; often they will
stay in the ground all the winter
without injury. To grow a fine crop
of turnips you use rich land, or land
very highly manured. It is a well
known fact that cow manure suits
best for turnips, but any stable ma
nure will do. If we had ample quan
tity would put it broadcast; if only
a limited supply, would put it in the
drill. Would use five tons per acre
or about 800 pounds of guano. The
best time to sow turnips is from July
15th to August 15th. From one to
two pounds is enough to sow on an
acre.
The three main things are: 1. To
break the land deep and harrow it
until you get it in fine tilth. Plow
the land three times and harrow it
six. 2. Manure liberally as we have
stated, then 3. Chop out the turnips
as you would cotton, as soon as they
begin to grow. Never wait until they
get large enough to fall over. This
causes you to have cracked shanks
and inferior bulbs. A great many
think turnips do not need hoeing, and
they only plow them. This gives you
small and inferior ones. The turnip
crop is worth all it costs, and we do
not know of a more certain crop or
one that pays better returns for la
bor expended. They sell well, but if
you are not convenient to market
you can get your money out of them
by feeding to mules, cows or hogs.
Cook tops and all with some corn
meal; they make excellent winter
feed for your chickens as well as for
your milk cows. —Southern Cultiva
tor.
FEEDING YOUNG CHICKS.
Don’t be in haste to feed the young
chicks. Twenty-four hours after the
last egg hatches is the earliest mo
ment for feed. Forty-eight or even
seventy-two hours may be none too
late. This little organism must have
time to assimilate the egg-yolk which
nature provides for its first nourish
ment. This is like the colostrum or
cows first milk, for the calf. If it is
not properly utilized indigestion and
disease may result. For the first few
days feed every three hours and with
great regularity. This is to prevent
over eating. Bread crumbs dipped
in milk and squeezed till they crum
ble makes a good feed. Don’t use
dough or wet mashes. Stale bread
crumbled fine is good. Some of the
dry commercial foods are also good.
Keep pure water in reach. Feed in
a chaff litter. Gauge quality by de
mand, but be careful and never over
feed. —T. C. K., in The Industrious
Hen.
HAPHAZARD.
If merchants, bankers or men in
any line of business, says the Texas
Farmer, used the haphazard methods
followed by many farmers, they
would not “last until breakfast.”
When farmers will all apply business
methods to their farming, they will
control the world.
CATTLE TICK.
One of the best signs of the times
in the South, says the Progressive
Farmer, is the growing interest in
the extermination of the cattle tick.
Wherever the tick is exterminated
from any given territory, cattle
prices advance, and stock raising,
with all its tremendous possibilities
for profit-making and soil-building,
becomes possible. Whenever the
fight against the tick is in progress,
we hope our readers will be among
the foremost in helping it along.

How He Got Rid
of Consumption
Remarkable Rescue of Prominent In
diana Man. Matter of Life-and-
Death Interest to All Throat
and Lung Sufferers
For Benefit of Jeffersonian Readers, He
Tells How He Cured Himself at
Home—Costs Nothing to Try.
“I think I owe it to all sufferers of
lung and throat trouble and consump
tion to tell them some mighty good
news, a sure way to cure themselves
right at home with little trouble,” said
E. S. Stroh, of Angola, Ind., yesterday,
as he passed through.
“Coming from me, probably, some
people might doubt this, but let me tell
you,” he said, as his 66-year-old face
flushed with a resurrected, youthful
smile, “over two years ago I was a
weazened-up wreck, a consumptive at
63. Three lung specialists passed me
up. Every day I would cough up about
a pint. I had chills and fever every
afternoon. I could hardly eat, even the
plainest food, coughed nearly all night,
and was down to 137 pounds when I
hit on the cure. Well, you see me now.
I weigh 166 pounds, frisky as a boy at
66, can do a big day’s work, and eat
like a prince.
“Now I am not trying to boost any
body, but I must give credit where
credit is due. Dr. J. Lawrence Hill,
499 Hill Building, Jackson, Mich., the
well known lung specialist of America
and probably so far the only success
ful one, cured me. That was two years
ago. I have just had my lungs ex
amined again and there is no trace of
consumption nor danger of its return
ing. Dr. Hill makes a specialty of
treating throat and lung sufferers at a
distance who have not the means of
visiting his office personally. That’s
the way he cured me, and I know of
many others who had one foot in the
grave almost, brought back to life by
what he calls his Rational Treatment.
It certainly is a wonder.
“I wish every reader of your paper
who has weak lungs, catarrh of the
bronchial tubes or catarrh in any form,
chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic
hacking cough, loss of flesh, night
sweats, hemorrhages, soreness or pain
in the chest or under the shoulder
blades or any other deadly symptom of
consumption, to send to Dr. Hill for his
trial package. This treatment checks
at once further progress of the dis
ease, develops atrophied cell tissues
and brings on new resisting power, ap
petite, flesh and good health.” Fill out
