The answers to their question
embracing all the reports of each
minister and involving the use of
tables of statistics makes it too
lengthy for us to report in this
place.
H07TETÎ COLLEGE.
The report of the Financial Sec
retary of the Institution elicited
considerable discussion and a course
of vigorous cross examination in
which many of the ministers took
part, revealed a most unsatisfacto
ry condition of a flairs. The report I
of the Secretary was meajrre and]
notât all such as it should have
lot" $13 000, but failed to show fo
whom tins amount was owing. It
finally transpired that the greafer
portion of that amount was due for!
money borrowed by the Secretary ,
to buy lands at Tax Sales, of which
'
he had bought 30 000acres. It was
claimed by him that the College had
an endowment 1'und of $10 000
bearing 8 per cent interest and he
was disposed to make, light of the
§13 000 debt, but if was shown
that a large portion, if not all oi
the said $10 000 was in notes, many
of which were utterly worthless,
and that nuits in many instances
• notes to
the great injury of the College and
the Church.
To say nothing ot the policy ol
buying lands at tax sales, whirl
is reprobated b\
seems that it should have o<
to the Secretary that, the attempts
to force the collection of the notes
by Jaw when owing to failures of
crops, high taxes etc., the people
were utterly unable to pay even the
interest, would be most disastrous,
as tlifc event has proved.
The Conference appointed a Spe

V'.' i' Owen, who were called to tiie
front <>f the Bishops' Stand and
lirst addressed by him and examin
ed for o dination and admission
with full Membership in the Con
ference.
The address of Bishop Paine
was the most impressive it has been
our fortune to hear. For fifty
seven years lie has labored in the
church and for the church. Stand
ing as he does upon the brink of the
^n-;it future, he looks back and has
to regret many imperfections in
his liie. but won! ! not if God per
njitteil him go back and live over
his life. Tue short remnant of
life that remains to him will be de
voted to God. Of tlie hundred who
stood upou the conference floor at
his.own ordination, he alone re
I
laid
and
an
the
mains, many fell early,some strug
B
J
led on aud then fell, but they'who
held out to the last, lived happy
lives'and died without fear. The
manner was more impressive tlinu
tho words oi his address, and to
hear that good old gentleman, aged
and looking without fear into the
cold chasm of the grave, and cheer
fully back upon along and useful
life, was impressive even to an un
believer, and elicited much real
feeling from the whole audience.
The whole class except Rev's A
E Clay and J '1 Sawyer, were ad
initted into full connection, and the
former were elected as eligible for
ordination into Deacon's orders.
The communicat ion from the Lou

discipline upon the temperance
question was made the special or

Mr. W. IT. Foster was relieved as

WEEKLY AHD SAIL? FOB 1875!
THE APPROACH of the Presidential
Election K i ves nnnsnal importance to tho
events and developments of 1875 Wa
^liall endeavor to describe them fullv
faithfully, and fearlessly.
THE WEEKLY SUN has now attained
circulation of over seventy thousand
copies. Its renders are found in everv
fetate and lerritorv, and itsqnalitv is well
known to the public. We shall not onlv
endeavor to keep it fnlly up to the old
standard, but to improve aud add toil*
variety and power.
THE WEEKLY SUN will rontinne fo
l.e a thorough newspaper. All the news
of the day will be found in it, condensed
when unimportant, at lull length when of
moment, and always, we trust, treated in
- clear, interesting and instructive manner
J^r r ,*r, to "' ak ° the WEEKLY
the host family newspaper in the
world. It will be full of entertaining and
appropriate reading of every sort, but will
• nit nothing to offend tho most scrnnu
.iis and delicate taste. It will alwavs
contain the most interesting stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
tnd logihly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a prom
inent feature in the WEEKLY SUN. and
its articles will always bo found fresh and
useful to the farmer.
The nnmber of men independent in no],
iios is increasing, and the WEEKLY SUN
is their paper especially. It belongs to
no party, and obeys no dictation, contend
ing for principle, and for the election of
the best men. It exposes the corruption
that disgraces the country and threatens
the overthrow of republican institutions.
It has no fear of knaves, and seeks no fa.
vors from their supporters.
The markets of every kind and the fash
ions are regularly reported in its columns
The price of the WEEKLY SUN Is one
!?".'** v '; lr f " r « sheet of eight pages, an d
ift.v-six columns. As this barely pays the
•xpensos of j>aper and printing, wo are
not able to make any discount or allow

-pecia! efforts to extend its circulation,
ndert.io new law. which requires pai.
if"t of postage in advance, one dollar a
"par. with twenty cents the cost of ,, re -
'. a P»^-»ge added, is the rate ofwiliscrin
