lecture on ‘ ‘ The Prince of Peace. ’ ’
Lincoln, Feb. 25. —W. J. Bryan re
fused Wednesday night to affix his
signature to a petition asking the leg
islature to submit the prohibition
question to a vote of the people.
The request to sign the petition was
made by Mrs. Frances B. Heald, state
president of the W. C. T. U., of Mr.
Bryan, when he came to the capitof
to appear before a house committee.
“Air. Bryan, will you please attach
your signature to my petition asking
the legislature to submit a constitu
tional amendment for prohibition to
a vote of the people?” was the re
quest of Mrs. Heald.
Then she went on to explain that
40,000 voters and 35,000 women al
ready had signed the petition, and
that signing did not in any way pledge
the signer in favor of prohibition.
* i lt is merely in line with the initia
tive and referendum idea expressed
in your utterances last Wednesday,”
said Mrs. Heald.
“Let ns first get the initiative and
referendum,” brusquely replied Mr.
Bryan as he rushed upstairs to at
tack the Carnegie fund.
It iijiows about 'as plainly as any
thing could Mr. Bryan’s complete in
consistency. He is an anti-prohibi
tionist, has always either used his in
fluence against prohibition directly,
or indirectly by fleeing the state
when the question was being agitated,
but as appears plain, the signature to
the petition to submit the question
to popular vote did not commit him
to either side of the question. It did
commit him to the principle of popu
lar government. ‘‘SHALL THE PEO
PLE RULE?” Not if there’s any
chance of their ruling in away that
would not please Mr. Bryan. His lib
erality is clearly shown in this when
he could scarcely be courteous to a
lady who presented the petition as a
representative of 35,000 good women
of his state, and 40,000 qualified vo
ters.
As was thoroughly expected, Judge

And, of course, on the ever-ready
technicality. Although rebating was

chaotic condition that is inevitable
when the government and the courts
attempt to regulate and control a pub
lic matter which the public does not
own. It will be a year or more be
fore the two-cent rate could be re
enforced. Meantime, under the pres
ent ruling of the court that it is in
some instances “confiscatory,” the
railroads may do about as they like.
If it be true that they can not “earn
dividends” on their stock (no ques
tion has been raised as to how much
of this is watered) at 2 cents, who is
to determine except the companies
themselves that they can earn divi
dends at 3 cents, or four or five?
Indeed, it is within the memory of
most persons now living that the
original contention of the roads when
reduced from 5 to 3 cents on passen
ger rates raised a terrific howl. Yet
they prospered in proportion to the
lowering of their rates, although the
passenger business is not the branch
in which the roads get most of their
money, and it is as easy to haul a car
full of passengers as a nearly empty
coach. Therefore, the failure of the
two-cent fare in Missouri is not a
victory for “conservative business
regulations,” but is merely a victory
for the railroads who intend to sub
mit to no regulation at all.
The Virginia rate case just decided
by the Supreme Court put into the
hands of the States the right to con
trol corporations doing business there
in. That was clear gain and clarified
the situation in so far as conflict had
arisen between State and Federal au
thority. But if the State courts per
mit the corporations to issue worth
less stock and demand dividends
thereon, there remains no hope, as we
have always seen, except in govern
ment ownership.

it is exploded, the better it will be

proved productive of peace and pros
perity in remote dominions like Aus
tralia and Canada might be equally as
efficacious in Ireland. That unhappy
island is even now torn by strife al
most equivalent to civil war, simply
because the Irish people are refused
home rule, and are mercilessly ex
ploited by the land-holding class.
Riots, mutilations of cattle, arson and
other forms of disorder prevail in the
spirit of retaliation natural to an out
raged subject-people. All of this
could be removed by employing fair
and-square justice, instead of trifling
with complicated and ineffective meas
ures designed to palliate the wretched
condition of the Irish agricultural
class.
