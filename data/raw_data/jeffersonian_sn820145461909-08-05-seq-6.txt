ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS.
Dear Sir: —I know you are a very
busy man with the preachers after
you on one side and the Socialists on
the other side, but I want you to
write an editorial on Socialism and
show us where they propose to get
the money to pay the running ex
penses of the Government. I don’t
understand that. I take the Rip-saw,
The Farmers’ Journal and read The
Appeal to Reason sometimes, and I
think they are doing more to divide
the masses of the people than any
thing that I know of.
Yours truly,
W. S. OSBORNE.

Answer: Our friends, the Social
ists, propose to abolish money and
substitute time-checks representing
the earnings of labor. Gold, silver,
etc., will disappear and the Govern
ment will live on time-checks.
Dear Sir: —Please show up in the
Jeffersonian the profits of a knitting
mill in the same way that you dealt
with the profits of a cotton mill. By
knitting mills, I mean where they
manufacture knitted underwear, etc.
Yours very truly,
J. T. WALLACE.

Answer: Have no data just now,
but will try to get some.
Dear Sir: I have before me a state
ment made by the “American Print
ing Co.,’’ of Fall River. From this
book I find that 78,000 bales of cot
ton are made into calico annually by
a combined force of 6,000 employees.
Divide 78,000 by 6,000 and we have
thirteen bales made into calico by
one employee.
Now would it not require at least
the labor of one able-bodied man for
every day of twelve months to pro
duce and gather and market thirteen
bales of cotton?
Then, if it requires as much, or
more, labor to produce one bale of
cotton as it does to manufacture the
same into calico, should the farmer
not have one-half as much for his
cotton as the factory for the same
made into calico?
True, there is money invested in
machinery in the mills, but there is
more money invested in land, mules,
fertilizers and farm tools.
I would like for you to put these
facts together in your inimitable way.
I don’t know that what I have said is
very clear, but the point I would have
you develop is this: If the factory
gets $250 for a bale of cotton made
into calico, then the farmer should
have $125.
Yours truly,
READER.
The Jeffersonian has taken prac
tically the same position.
At present prices and profit of
cotton-cloth mills, raw cotton is
worth at least 20 cents a pound, and
ought to bring it.
DR. TAYLOR IS EVER WELCOME.
Dear Sir: —Shortly after receiving
yours this morning, a patron from
whom I had not expected payment
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
gave me two dollars; this I construed
as a direct intervention of Provi
dence in behalf of the “Jeffs,” which
are doing a prophet’s office in expos
ing “spiritual wickedness in high
places."
I have been conscious of the fact
all along that I might be “butting
in,” but, in the language of Mr. Peck
sniff, “it is hereditary,” and can’t be
helped; our family have marched and
fought with the “forlorn hope for
generations, rescuing from the spoil
of war only self-respect; and deeming
it a sufficient compensation to be able
to say in the end, “I have fought a
good fight, I have finished my course,
I have kept the faith.” Therefore, I
feel a comradeship for and a smypa
thy with every other soldier of the
“forlorn hope” and when I find one
that is a sure marksman engaged in
picking off the enemy I want, if I can,
to help mould the bullets —hence the
“butting in.”
I note what you say relative to your
labors and losses. I am not surpris
ed; it is the old, old story repeating
itself, with some variation in circum
tasnce and degree, wherein the fight
er suffers hardship and loss, and if
success crowns his efforts his follow r
ers offer him up as an early sacrifice
and proceed to wreck things general
ly. But it is something to find one’s
self in the company of the patriots
and heroes of all ages, and to be
satisfied with one’s life work when
it ends.
Your last harpoon has started the
whale (Missionaryism) to spouting
blood, I think. I thank you for your
kindly offer of the back numbers of
the magazine, but let my renewal
date from April and send the July
and August numbers as in due
course.
Yours fraternally,
JOHN N. TAYLOR.

IN HEARTY ACCORD WITH THE
JEFFERSONIAN’S MIS
SIONARY VIEWS.
Dear Sir:—l do not know that I
can compose an article worthy of pub
lishing in your paper, but if I do not
see it any more I will not be sur
prised, as I am uneducated. I am a
farmer, but am unable to do any
manual labor as I was disabled by a
team running away with me last Au
gust. I am in hearty accord with
your missionary views, and feel like
I could write more than enough for
a paper on this subject. I want to
ask, what do we send money and min
isters to China for? Is it to civilize
the Chinaman, to Christianize the
Chinaman? If so, is not there enough
right here around us in Georgia,
Florida and Alabama to use all of
our money at home where it belongs,
and not send it off to a foreign coun
try to induce them to come to Ameri
ca to commit such brutal murders as
the murder of Elsie Siegel. I can’t
see what we want with the Chinamen
over here; they do not make desir
able citzens, they do not cause money
to be in circulation, they hoard it up
and live like brutes, then take it
back or send it home. It would be
better to keep the undesirable for-
‘Blje TJeffersoniait
eigner out, for they do not benefit us
or our country. I wish I could make
an appeal to every individual when
the ministers appeal to them for for
eign missionary collections, and get
them to think like the admiral did
when he said to his army during the
Spanish war, “Remember the Maine.”
Remember the needs of your own
people here at home and take your
money and buy your wife a dress or
a pair of shoes or provision for the
home. We don’t need the Chinaman
over here.

A PLEA FOR UNITY.
For The Jeffersonian:
I am an old Granger of ’74, Peter
Cooper Greenbacker, Populist and
Socialist, and am ready to work any
where to better the condition of the
oppressed poor and producing classes.
I do wish that every opposer of greed,
graft, monopoly, bribery, injustice
and labor slavery could properly re
alize the fact, that if we ever win
and get our rights it must be in unity
and co-operation. I am a “dyed in
the wool” Populist as to the princi
ples, and have studied the Socialist
principles very closely also, and all
the difference I see is that the So
cialists are more aggressive and in
stead of asking a half-loaf just de
mand the whole loaf, cheese and
everything that should, and that
does, justly belong to the people who
have produced it. Is there anything
wrong to that? Certainly not. Then
why should we fight and oppose
them? Beside, in so doing, we only
weaken ourselves. Reformers and
labor unions are in the same position
that the denominational churches are.
Just so long as the devil can keep the
professed Christians divided and
fighting each other, just to that ex
tent he can destroy their usefulness
and control them and the world. And
in the same manner, just so long as
the two old allied parties, headed by
the rich capitalists of America and
England, can keep laborers, pro
ducers and their friends divided,
fighting and pulling against each
other they will continue to control
and rob us. I say, let’s get together
every laborer, producer and opposer
of slavery and injustice, no matter
who you are or to what party, organi
zation or nationality you at present
belong. We have a common cause,
near and dear to all, to fight for, and
common enemy to all of us to con
tend against. We have the majority
if we would get together, and when
we .get together let the majority rule
and I am sure they will rule right.
No matter about the name; whether
it is Jeffersonian Democracy, Social
Democracy, Republican Democracy,
People’s Democracy or no Democ
racy. Success, victory and justice is
what we want, what we demand and
what we must have, and that in the
very near future, or we and our chil
dren are doomed to slavery. We have
no time or ammunition to waste on
each other, but use it where it will
be effective. Lay selfishness aside,
for selfish greed is our common ene
my and curse to humanity. Let love,
justice and the good of humanity pre
vail.

Yours for the right,

THE BLACK PERIL.
Hon. T. E. Watson: —I am wit
ness to your numerous and earnest
warnings to the Southern people of
their neglect to protect themselves
against the gradual encroachments
being made by the negro race; di
rected, aided and abetted by a cer
tain class of Northern element upon
the customs, rights, uses and inter
ests, if not indeed the laws of our
people. I look upon this neglect
with great interest for coming gen
erations of Southern whites. I have
long since predicted that in the not
distant future the negro will have in
his control the entire cotton crop of
the South. They are thoroughly or
ganized and drilled, and it is their
nature to obey their master. What
he commands they will do implicitly.
When they become producers of
seven or nine-tenths of the cotton
crop, can any one doubt that they
will be brought to realize their ad
vantage, capture and control the
goose whose golden egg the South
ern whites for want of united ca
pacity fail to apprecate? What more
can you do? Or can be done?
Truly,
WILLIAM W. ANDERSON.

COL. HUFF ON COMPULSORY
EDUCATION.
I have been waiting and watching,
and watching and waiting to see your
hand on compulsory education. This
week’s Jeffersonian is now before me
and, as usual, you are absolutely cor
rect in the position you take on this
great question. But, as you well say:
“No penalizing poverty.” That is in
substance exactly what you do say
when you say, or suggest, that a fight
should be made on the “villainous
School Book Trust.” But the hardest
and best lick you strike is when you
say, “Furnish the tools as well as the
workmen, and make the schools free.”
If it is right for the State to pay
teachers to instruct rich men’s chil
dren, then it is right to pay for the
books to be used by children whose
parents are not able to buy them.
There is nothing paternalistic about
this. It is democratic to the core.
I thank you for giving your public
endorsement to compulsory educa
tion and for going a few steps in ad
vance of its present-day advocates.
If the child is in any sense the ward
of the State, then let the State see to
it that the ward is protected, and
that the poverty of the parent shall
be no bar to that protection.
I thank you for your strong en
dorsement. The white people of
Georgia have been sleeping over this
question long enough.
Sincerely yours,
Macon, Ga. W. A. HUFF.
