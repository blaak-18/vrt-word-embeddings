4 ‘l would caution you to watch
closely your employes, that they do
not use your money too promiscuous
ly,” said Filmore Reid, the retired
banker, as he sat at the head of the
table in the grand dining-room of his
palatial home, presiding over a ban
quet tendered to the directors and
large stockholders of the bank of
which he had been cashier for a num
ber of years, which position he had
but recently resigned.
At the other end of the table sat
Marion Swords and David Wright,
touching elbows. The former was a
substantial farmer, recently elected
a director of the Bank of Baywood,
who used the bank as a depository,
while the latter, a leading merchant
of the town, also a director, used the
bank as a convenience. About mid
way of the table, seated among this
array of bankers, was one stranger,
introduced by the host as Merritt
Miller.
Filmore Reid’s was a palatial home,
erected without consideration of cost,
situated amidst a very bower of roses
and shrubbery, and fitted up with the
most expensive draperies and antique
furniture. The day selected for the
banquet proved to be a cold one, and
large back-logs furnished fuel in the
drawing room, library and dining
room for the crowd of financiers hon
ored with an invitation to attend this
grand affair. Cold as it was, the lit
tle courthouse town of Baywood, pos
sessing the one bank, an institution
of $50,000 capital and SIOO,OOO of de
posits, was alive with activity, here a
man driving a team of oxen, there a
rushing clerk and yonder a slowly
moving, decrepit old woman—all pat
rons of the Bank of Baywood.
It was nearly one o’clock in the
afternoon, and the banqueters had
not long been seated, yet the stran
ger, Merritt Miller, was seen to be
ill at ease. Reid was looking conde
scendingly upon his guests, while he
continued:
“Many a trusted employe has
snatched at that which glitters, only
to lose what belongs to himself, as
well as much that belongs to others,
in his reckless race for gold. It is
true that I made my wealth by using
your money, but you ran but little
risk, because of my knowledge of
men and thing’s—a pre-requisite not
possessed by every man handling oth
er people’s money!”
This remark brought about general
conversation, followed by the light
ing of cigars and the gathering in
groups of the now surfeited guests.
Until now the easy-going citizens of
Baywood never thought of a run on
a bank, but these enigmatical remarks
of Filmore Reid had caused an atmos
phere of electrical excitement to per
vade the assembled guests, and as
Marion Swords and David Wright
drew aside in earnest conversation
Merritt Miller silently withdrew
through the front door. Swords and
Wright walked leisurely to a lounge
near the fire and seated themselves,
discussing meanwhile the startling re-

marks made by Reid. One was dis
gusted, while the other was startled.
But the major portion of the guests
were still hanging about the now
prominent citizen like bugs about an
electric light.
“View the matter as you please,
but my funds shall come out of that
bank tomorrow, my stock is for sale,
and my resignation as a director
shall go in at the next meeting,”
Marion said, with a determined air.
“That would ruin the bank.”
“I think it is already ruined, for
while Reid came out a rich man, the
paper carried by the bank for those
who aided him in carrying on his
schemes will never be paid, and I now
realize that to prolong the situation
is to extend deception, and I shall
no longer be a party to such a
course. ’ ’
Wright was now beginning to
squirm under this onslaught, for he
was a heavy borrower from the bank,
along with other directors. The meth
od pursued was for these men to in
dorse for each other, but when Reid
became surfeited he ceased borrow
ing and discontinued indorsing.
Therefore, when Reid severed his con
nection with the institution his name
was not on any paper, either as prin
cipal or surety, but the paper of
those with whom he was at first as
sociated amounted to as much as the
capital stock of the bank, while their
combined wealth would not aggregate
one-half of that amount.
Marion was a new director, not
thoroughly in touch with the entire
details of the bank, and, hence, was
ignorant of how severely he was
tramping’ on the toes of Wright.
In the hall there was an incessant
ringing of the telephone bell, the call
being for the president of the Bank
of Baywood, one of the most interest
ed of the group of listeners about
Reid.
“What! A run?” the president
almost shrieked into the receiver.
“Over the wire? A telegram? Oh,
the agent exposed the contents of a
telegram to a newspaper? Well, I
will be there presently.” He hung
up the receiver and turned, with
blanched face, toward the crowd of
men looking on in consternation.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “there is a
run on the Bank of Bay wood, caused
by the telegraph operator divulging
the contents of a telegram sent to a
city newspaper by a reporter, and
something must be done at once to
save the bank.”
Swords and Wright remained to
hear no more, but hurried on to the
bank.
Notwithstanding the excitement
caused by this overwhelming infor
mation, Reid noted the absence of
Merritt Miller, but gave it no special
consideration, and requesting his
guests to make themselves at home,
he withdrew to the library, where he
examined his pass book and found
that he had exactly thirty dollars to
his credit in the Bank of Baywood,
hence no grounds for worry.
The directors present withdrew to
TSijft Jeffersonian
the drawing-room, and there held an
informal board meeting. They decid
ed to send a committee to Reid to
enlist his assistance. In the library
Reid sat in calm repose while he lis
tened, a few minutes later, to this
committee as they told him that un
less he came to the rescue of the bank
at once they would all be ruined men.
If the bank should break an exami
nation would follow, resulting in such
an exposure as would disgrace them
if it did not lead to worse.' A quiet
smile rested on his sardonic lips as
he calmly replied:
t“I am sorry, gentlemen, but I am
now a retired banker, and my funds
are tied up in stocks and bonds.”
The committee had just returned to
the directors’ meeting and reported
their failure when Swords and
Wright came in and stated that a law
yer, accompanied by an expert ac
countant, had presented an order
from the judge at the bank and taken
temporary charge.
Swords, as he arose to address the
meeting, was perceptibly wrought up,
but in a quiet tone he said: “It was
my intention to withdraw from the
bank, but I am not one to leave a ship
as long as she floats. Contrary to
legitimate business principles, each of
you directors are borrowers of your
own bank. I do not want to see the
innocent depositors of this bank suf
fer, and if each of you will give a
clear deed to your property in as far
as your pro rata responsibility goes
in settling the indebtedness of the
bank I will have expressed from my
deposit in New Orleans SIO,OOO in
currency.”
This proposition was scorned, for
the directors were secure to the ex
tent of their homestead exemptions
in any event, and they would rely on
the laxity of the law in escaping from
criminal prosecution on the grounds
that their approval of discounts was
the exercise of an opinion only.
A loud knocking at the front door
distracted further debate, and in a
moment an officer, accompanied by
the lawyer whom Swords and Wright
had just seen at the bank, was ush
ered in, soon followed by Reid him
self, whom, in fact, these men had
come to see. The entrance into a
house by a doctor, a lawyer, an of
ficer, or an undertaker always brings
a gloom over the occupants, and such
a gloom overspread this band of finan
ciers today.
“Mr. Reid,” said the lawyer, who
had taken a seat unasked, “I will
read this copy of a telegram and state
my business afterwards:
‘At a bankers’ banquet today
given at his palatial home by ex-
Cashier Filmore Reid, among other
things the ex-banker said, “I would
