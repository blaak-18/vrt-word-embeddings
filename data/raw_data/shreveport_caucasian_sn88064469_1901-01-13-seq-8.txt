last June with something like smothering spells. My flesh Felt dead. I h.d heart palpisati-,l; secm'cd i:ke my lungs
were lull of needi's. I had a burning sensation right under my left breast: was short o '-.t. I could not hold
still at all. I had six doctors but none cf them did me any good. The last one said my .",. + as ihnt mbek ards.
He straightened it and then it cane dowr.. I had shat Is called fallinrg o the womb. ThI dctor a \e me a sup.
porter and a pessarv. I had no stomach to eat art \was so weaki that I coui!d hardly ..ak ,cross the room. I have
taken six bottles of Wine of Cardui and it has helped me. My month!v -;ckness stopped on me and 4::.c d.! Carr6i
corrected that so that my per:ods are re~:. r rno and I feel b.tter than I have in nint months. I an do all rv
housework and ! go to see my nr.ihbors on foot. LIZZIE MOROAN.
