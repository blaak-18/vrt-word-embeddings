A Phillippine Shack and What Lives in It
iHE islands of the Philippine
archipelago number away up
in the hundreds. Some of
T
them are not any larger than
an ordinary dining table, many of
which are not charted, while others
are as large as many of our larger
states. Luzon, the continental island
of the group, is about the size of
Colorado, and the next largest, Min
danao, is nearly as large as Okla
homa. All of the coast towns and
villages of the islands are frequently
visited by violent tornadoes, called
typhoons, which, within a very few
minutes, completely wipe a town out
of existence. Within forty-eight
hours after such a storm the village
is again occupying its old site as if
nothing had happened. Wherever
the banana grows, no matter in what
tropical country, the inhabitants are
invariably lazy, and I verily believe
that the natives of the Philippines
are the laziest of all. About the only
work a native will do is to build
the shack in which he and his fam
ily live and plant and cultivate his
rice “paddie.” Nature has, with
lavish generosity, supplied all of his
simple wants, and about all he has
to do is to reach out his hand and
gather what he requires. The male
native is a firm believer in letting
the women do the work. After a
typhoon has swept away a village the
native proceeds to the nearest bam
boo patch and with his working bolo
(a thick, heavy, long-bladed knife)
chops down a number of the giant
canes and carries them to the plat of
ground upon which he wishes to
build. The longest and heaviest
poles are used as uprights and ex
tend from the ground to the eaves
of the roof. With the exception of
the roof, the entire house and its fur
nishings are made of bamboo, which
is the universal building material of
the Philippines. When the four up
rights are in place they are lashed
together with the half of a bamboo
cane split lengthwise, which forms
the foundation upon which the floor
is laid. The four sides of the shack,
as well as the floors, are made of
small strips of split cane which are
laced or woven together with a
strong, tough and exceedingly pliable
fiber obtained from a vine which re
sembles the common rattan vine of
America. In the entire construction
of a hut not a nail, screw or a piece
of metal of any kind is used. The
roof is made of a long, tough swamp
grass-called “nipa,” or “pina.” This
grass, which is about seven feet long,
is tied at the root ends in bundles
the size of a man’s wrist. They are
securely tied in layers to the frame
work of the roof, beginning at the
eaves and overlapping each other
like shingles, extending to the apex.
This thatch roof is excellent and ab
solutely waterproof, as it necessarily
must be, as the Philippine winter is
the rainy season, and in no other
place in the world does the rain come
down as ceaselessly and in such
dense quantities as it does in the
islands. I have seen it rain day and
night for six weeks without a mo
ment’s pause. The annual rainfall
is in the neighborhood of four me
ters (over 13 feet).
On account of the floods, which are
the natural results of such a vast
quantity of rain, the floors of the
shacks are built from 8 to 10 feet
above the ground and are entered by
means of ladders, also built of bam
boo and the rings lashed on with
strips of vine fiber. A visitor in the
islands is astonished to see with
what ease and dexterity a dog will
mount these ladders. In the num
ber of mongrel curs a Philippine vil
lage can successfully compete with
any Mexican town, and I have yet to
see a dog which is large enough to
walk that cannot run up a ladder
while a native is thinking about it.
The floors of the huts, also the walls,
are made of small, narrow strips of
bamboo cleverly woven together.
The whole structure, when complete,
is elastic and springy, so the most
severe earthquakes, which are of
common occurrence, have no effect
whatever upon them. The average
shack is about 10 feet square, but by
building additions, or “lean-tops,”
they are enlarged to suit the require
ments of a large family, or even two
or more families. Should two house
wives engage in a quarrel, or for any
other reason a neighborhood should
become dissatisfied to a native, he
summons five or six friends to his
aid, picks up his shack and trans
ports it to a more congenial locality.
It is a common thing to see a
gang of natives carrying a house
through the streets of any village.
Should the native so desire, and have
sufficient energy, he can. with his
bolo as his only tool, and bamboo
and different colored dyes as his only
materials, make his home very at
tractive. The best and most preten
tious houses are cozy and home like.
For countless generations the natives
have worked with bamboo until they
have in the highest degree acquired
perfection in all forms of construc
tion. They make all kinds of furni
ture, such as beds, chairs, tables,
etc., and even the most artistic deco
orative ornaments.
The interior walls of the best
houses are draped with bamboo mats
interwoven with colored grasses. So
expert are they in the art of hand
weaving that, aside from the pictures
of trees, flowers, landscapes and ani
mals, the portraits of members of the
family are often seen. The features,
and even the expression are marvel
ously reproduced. Such pieces, like
the panama hat, are woven under
water.
The thatch roof of a native shack
affords an excellent dwelling place
for many different kinds of insects,
small snakes (sometimes big ones)
and lizards. The most troublesome
inhabitants of the roofs are tarantu
las, scorpions and centipedes. The
latter are most numerous of the ven
omous trio and are most dreaded by
the American soldier. In appearance
they are very much like the centi
pede found in the southwest of North
America, and no doubt are very pois
onous, although I have never known
of anyone being bitten by them; but
they frequently drop from the roof
upon a sleeping person below.
Should they fall upon a part of the
body unprotected by clothing and
run over the bare skin a fiery red
streak is left that rapidly becomes
inflamed and smarts, stings and
burns. This inflammation, however,
quickly subsides. Another species of
centipede that also makes his home
ISlje
in the roof is about an inch wide,
six or seven inches long and jet black
in color. This fellow, fortunately,
is seldom seen. His bite is deadly.
When a native is bitten by one of
them he immediately sends for the
priest. The bite of a’ - tropical taran
tula is also very poisonous, but if
you will allow them to leisurely
crawl off of your body, and do not
get them angry, they will not harm
you.
After falling on you and finding
that he has landed upon something
alive and warm, the scorpion makes
haste to depart, but he does not for
get to plunge his stinger into you at
every jump, whereupon you jump
and yell and the chances are you
will break the third commandment
into small bits and hurl the pieces at
scorpions, the Philippines and the
fool patriotic sentiment that caused
you to enlist.
The snakes are scary, but will not
hurt you. If a big one he is likely to
be the family pet and occupies about
the same position in the Philippine
shack as the common house cat does
in the American home. He is gen
erally found in the roof hunting the
insects and small lizards that he
knows live there. The family pet
snake will keep away the rats and
mice. He displays an astonishing
amount of intelligence and will come
when called and eat out of your
hand. They are of a very affection
ate disposition and like to be
stroked and petted. They will not
bite and are therefore not venomous.
Domestic cats are unknown in the
islands, but this snake, in a large
measure, fills tabby’s place. You
will always find these snakes cover
ed with scars, received in battles with
the large black vicious Philippine
rats. They kill the rat by constric
tion and after crushing to a pulp
every bone in its body, swallow it
whole. When meal time comes the
family snake and the family dogs
are always on hand. The native
lady only cooks once a day. The
firewood that an American housewife
consumes in the preparation of one
meal would last her Philippine sister
a month. A little bamboo stand
about 18 inches square is built in a
corner of the shack, on top of which
is placed six or eight inches of well
packed earth. To a dangling vine
fibre, which is attached to the roof
directly over the center of the stand,
is hung the rice pot. A few handful
of bamboo shavings or small twigs ’
are sufficient to boil the rice and
cook the fish or meat and the day’s
housework is over.
When the “chow” is ready a large
bowl of rice on top of which are
small bits of meat or fish is placed in
the center of the floor around which
the family and guests, if any, seat
themselves, with their feet doubled
under them, and proceed to get busy.
Outside of the aristocracy knives and
forks are unknown. Each individual
thrusts his or her hand into a com
mon bowl and with thumb and fin
gers mould a small quantity of rice
in the form of a pyramid. This is
conveyed to the mouth with the mid
dle and index fingers of the left
hand and shoved into the awaiting
orifice with the thumb.
The right hand holds a bit of meat
