Our Sltandard Bearer.
The Populist Press Association
at Alexandria last Saturday was
honored with an interview with
Capt. John N. Pharr, our nominee
for Governor on the Populist tick
et.
In his plain, unassuming, but
cordial manner he shook the hands
of the Populist editors, and assur
ed them of his pleasure in meeting
for the first time a body of Popu
lists, whom be took to be farmers
that had suffered froh Democrat-l
ic misrule, just as the Sugar-plant
era suffered, and that it was but
natural that they should join issues
for mutual protection.
He said that he saw but little
ditterence in the needs of the two
sections of our State, and that the
three different platforms upon
which he had been nominated prov
ed this most conclusively.
He said that if the Populist plat
form adopted at Alexandria on
January 8th, was a fair expression
of Populism, he was a very good
Populist, as he indorsed it hearti
ly. That he was for free silver,
and had always been so.
He maid that it was more than i
folly to propose as some had done,
the retirement of the $846,000,000
of greenbacks in our national cur
rency and replace them with inter
et-bearing bonds.
If there is aaything the Popu
list editors understand thoroughly
it is the financial question, and1
they plied the Captain with ques
tions, but they found him orthodox
with their views, and they were
highly pleaped with the interview.
The Times-Democrat, sneering
ly refers to this interview, as fol
lows :
Ca Pharr, however, without I
troubing himself shout what the
other sugar planters may do or
think delares himself a stalwart
Populist. He is for free silver,
16 td 1, sand for amythiq else the '
Populist party wants. He is a
P#hbitib st (which tickles the
lasl opl)m p op asd so strict
S8bblI- n 1 popular in that
don)l thMt he won ot ttavel on'
he rivals the fa- I
of his brd, another metare that

Mro. Booth's Addreur.
In his fifth announcement that
he lacks the patriotism and the de
sire for the success of our cause
to which the State Central Com
mittee appealed when they polite
ly asked him to resign and support
the Pharr ticket, Mr. Booth makes
some blunders which we have been
asked to correct
We hope that Mr. Booth does
not desire to misrepresent
us, but attribute his mistakes
to the Democratic press and other
unreliable sources of information
on which he has had to depend
since his refusal to attend or ad
vise the State Central Committee,
the official head of his party.
More than half his address is
devoted to a fair recital of the his
tory of our campaign up to
our convention, all of which
shows that he, more than any
one else worked for a "Union
ticket" of all elements opposed to
Fosterism.
He says the personnel of the
ticket was not discussed, and right
there it is strange that as we have
a good "Union ticket" now in the
field the personnel of it is so im
portant.
But we have it in black and
white from men who stand quite as
well as Mr. Booth, that he acqui
esced in the naming of the Pugh
ticket, and promised that it should
be indorsed by the Populist con
vention.
He next gravely informs us that
the convention unanimously passed
a resolution refusing the head of
of theticket to any but a pronounc
ed Populist. Mr. W. L. Shackel
ford the introducer of that reso
lotion, says there wss opposition
to it, and he withdrew it, and that
it did not pass. This statement is
corrobarated by I. L, McAlpin,
one of the secretaries, and by many
members of that convention.
Next he says, "they unanimous
ly tendered me the nomination."
He forgets just there what perhaps
every other member of the conven
tion remembers with shame, his
two lengthy caucus speeches, axe
ento for the nomination for him
self, and decrying Judge (unby,
saying that he would be acceptable
to the Sugar planters and Repub
ienm, and Judge Gunby would
aet, recounting publicly and pri
vately his party service, and de
ollaru it would ruin him if he did
not get the nomination. That is
the way it was "unanimously ten
dered." We have the substance of
those speeches, verified by many
members of the convention, aad
they may proveinteresting reading
dariag Mr. Booth's campaign.
"The discussion Ia regard to
giving Republicans several places
an the tiket was tavorabi -
essang when those who d for
uperly represeanted the Pugh fac
tdo seat our mnve-tion a propi
tion to reconasider its acmon ad

To H. L,. Brian, of Peopl.'s party,
Henry McCall of the National
Republican party, and Andlrew
Hero, Jr., of the R',pullican
party of Louisiana :
Gentlemen- I have received
your several com!nunicatiois in
forming me of my nomination by
your respective organizations on
your joint ticket for the office of
Governor of Louisiana. I have
read the resolutions adopted by the
People's party at Alexandria and
the resolutions adopted by the two
Republican organizations at their
conventions held ih New Orleans.
I am unalterably opposed to the
ratification of the suffrage amend
ment proposed by the last Legisla
ture, avowedly for the purpose of
maintaing the government in the
hands of the Democratic party, and
for that sole purpose. I am and
have always been in favor of the
protection of all American indus
tries and American labor, and I
am for a free vote and an honest
count.
Thee cardinal declarations
agreed upon by all three of your
organizations have my cordial and
universed approbation.
If elected I will use the power
of my of~ce to protect every citi
zen of Louisiana in all of his civil
and political rights, and will see
that the election laws are so ad
ministered that there shall be a fair
registration of every voter, equal
representation of all parties at the
polls, the free right of every voter
to cast his vote as he chooses, an
honest count of the votes and an
honest return of the result. I
have lihed in this State for forty
years. I have never sought ohce,
but I respond to the call of the
honest people of this State because
I believe it to be my duty as a citi
zen.
Respectfully yours,
J. N. PHARR.
