PREDICTS A RACE WAR.
Rev. Thomas Dixon, during the deliv
ery of a lecture at Cleveland, 0., on the
26th instant, said: "There will be a race
war representing the most terrible con
flict the world has ever seen. Nothing
that can be done by human hands can
prevent this. It will come just as certain
as the sun continues to shine. On one
side will be the Anglo-Saxon- race and
on the other the negro people, With
30oo00 years of civilization in their favor
there can be but one result. The Anglo
Saxon people will sweep the negro peo
ple off the face of the continent.
"There are 50o,oo000 negroes in Chicago
and a proportionately larger number in
Philadeljhia. Sooner or later there are
bound to be local disturbances in these
cities between the two races. It is up
North here where the trouble will 1
start." l
This prediction refers to the North,
but we of the South indulge in no such
fears. White and blacks have lived so.
long together and understand each
other so well that there is little danger
of serious conflicts between them. That
the whites and blacks of the North will
clash before many years goes without
saying. They are active and aggressive
rivals in all lines of labor, and the negro
claims a great deal more in the way of
social and poliical recognition.-Baton
Rouge Truth.
This contention is now in progress in
the North and it is, after all, the simple
question of the "survival of the fittest."
The negro in the South who attends to
his own affairs need have no fear. In
the South he is safe with his friend,
the Southern white man, who under
stands him and will protect him in all
his rights
HONESTY PAYS.
We have just read in one of our ex
changs an account of a young lady
who, by the death of relatives, was
placed in very reduced circumstances,
and compelled to enter a dry goods store
as saleswoman at the glove counter.
Some very defective gloves were given
her to sell. She called the attention of
the floor manager. He told her it was
her business to obey orders and 'ell
whatever she was told to.
She could not do it conscientiously,
and though very much in need of her
wages, told him she could not. He dis
charged her, and site was almost heart
broken. Bm the merchant who owned
the store noticed her absence, heard the
:o.or tnh~a r's explanation, sent for the
.yorg lady, examined the gloves, sent
back to the manufacturer, thanked
-her in behalf of his firm, raised her
waes, and assured her that she should
|ever again be interfered with in the
Sc scientious discharge of her duty.

BLANCIARD RALLY
Ae LA\RGE NUMBER OF CITIZENS
y MET AT COURT HOUSE.
y A Hearty Greeting by Democrats and
nFriends--The Personnel of the
Executive Committee.
As anticipated there was gathered in
the court house Tuesday night a large
number of citizens of Shreveport,
among whom were a number of the
friends of Mr. Blanchard who responded
to personal invitations. It was a Blan
chard meeting organized in the political
interests of Mr. Blanchard and as, an
nounced was suggested and intet.ed to
repudiate the slanders of a few persons
that he could not carry his own parish.
This gathering was called to order by
Colonel W. H. Wise, who asked that
secretaries beappointed, and on motion
of Judge Pugh this "old chestnut" was
again thrust upon the representatives of
the press by whom it was accepted with
meekness and resignation, -There was
then read a list of vice presidents, resi
dents of the city and countty, compris
ing over a hundred, and of the gentle
men from the country wards in attend
ance there were noted: "Messrs. W. E.
Wasson, Noah Tyson, W. O. Owens,
B. F. Ratcliff, B. F. Teat, D. G. Moore,
William Adams, Lee Johnson, John W.
Keel, Rives Browning, L. A. Alexander,
R.. H. Harrell, J. W. Wood and C. C.
Alexander." In the gathering were a
number of the personal friends of Mr.
Blanchard from Bossier and Red River,
and one of the features was the reading
by Judge Pugh of telegrams from gen
tlemen residents of various sections of
the tSate, expressing their best wishes
and giving the assurance of their loyal
support. The reading of each telegram
was greeted with cheers.
.The speeches were by Colonel W. H.
Wise, Mr. like Bernstein, Mr. John
Monkhouse Sr.. of Jewella, Dr. C. H.
Irion of Bossier, Mr. Ben Wolfson of
Red River. Mr. C. W. Cory, Mr. Charles
L. Stowe, Jr., Captain H. P. Wells, Mr.
W. A. Mabry. After Mr. Blanchard had
en,ded his speech, to which ;the closest
attention was given and tliroughout.
which he was frequently applauded, Col
onel John S. Young proposed three
cheers and a tiger for the next governor
of Louisiana, Judge N. C. Blanchard,
which: was responded to with enthusi
asm.
The following is a copy of two reso
lutions submitted by Mr. Mike Bern
stein and adopted unanimously:
"Resolved, That the report that is be
ing so persistently circulated throughout
the State by a few persons here ti t
Justice N: C. Blanchard could nut carry I
Caddo parish in the approaching State
Democratic Convention is untrue and
utterly unfounded.
"Resolved further, That at the proper
time the Democrats of Caddo parish will
present his name as their choice for the.
exalted office of governor of this, his
native State, with every confidence that
he will have a united delegation in his
support, and to that end we pledge the
ever faithful Democracy of Caddo par
ish."
The following named gentlemen con
stitute the Blanchard executive commit
tee: W. H. Wise, chairman; Ike Bar
ron, John S. Young, Samuel Speaks, J.
M. Martin, A. Currie, A. S. Toombs, J.
W. Atins, George H. Russell, N. Gold
stein, John A: Sewall, J. B. Ardis, F. A.

key, Will L. Young, W. A. Nelson, Her.
man Strube, Thomas B. Chase, T. C.
Barret, J. C. Pugh, S. Q. Hollingsworth,
L. E. Stokes, J. M. Tucker.
And with this meeting there has been
actively inaugurated a political cam
paign nearly thirteen months preceding
the election in 1904, and at least nipe
months of the nomination whether by
primary election or' State convention.
Why this haste?
The gathering was a success, as it
should have been, and in the home city
of Mr. Blanchard, where there are over
25,0oo inhabitants; a meeting less pro
nounced would have been' recorded a
discredit to him. From that view then
Mr. Blanchard's friends should be well
tisfied and the endorsing resolution
must be no less gratifying to him, but
there is one feature of this meeting
which will address itself forcefully to
the men who, unmoved by sentiment
and personality, think and reason logi
cally, the Democrats throughout the
State who are more concerned in the re
form of abuses in the party, snd who
fa*or measures and policies for the wel
fare of fl ?oeraey as lbeg paramount
s~~~ ils reach,
tralize this influence the Blanchard rally
was a logical sequence, what will +e the,
power of these "fez.' persons" when or
ganized systematically fýp the purpose
as sustaining the allegation that Mir.
Blanchard could not carry his own par
ish? From the Caucasian's Democratic
point of view that resolution should not
have been submitted nor adopted, as
it indicates a weakness maintained in a
boastful sense. in the absence of an issue
which is not before the people. The en
dorsement oi Mr. Blanchard was the
proper thing to do, and with that en
dorsement he and his friends could have
adjourned the meeting. But the best and
greatest of men will make mistakes.

BOOKER W~ASHINGTON.
There was extended not long since an
invitation to Booker Washington to de
liver.a lecture in this city before an au
dience of white people. The Caucasian's
view has been requested on this subject.
Our answer is that the least said of it
the better. Booker Washington as a
leader of his race, as one who is striv
ing hopefully for the betterment of his
-eople, realizes the existing conditions
which have been intensified by incidents
at the capital and the "strenuousness"
of Roosevelt, and has postponed the lec

2 'I'oo Plebeian a Dish.
; The pains of being a dignitary in an
e- ancient country with a tradition of
splendor is illustrated by this anecdote
a- from India. It is related that the vice
d ro3's eye lighted one day upon a dish
at which he gazed for a moment with
c incredulity. 'What is this?" he de
re manded at last. , trembling retainer
gasped that it was clee pudding. No
less a personage than the viceroy's eon
is sort had ordered the humble pudding
, which eminent statesmen may be seen
1- eating at their clubs with undisguised
)r enjoyment any day of the parliamen
tary session. But the viceroy frowned.
,r "Take it away." he said. "Never let
1- me see such a thing again." This is
( how the orient differs from the occi
te dent. Rice pudding might have ruined
the dignity of the vice regal table in
native opinion.

Chinese Transportation Methods.
:h The cheapest method of transporta
is tion in the world is that by Chinese
d junks that are dragged up and down
r their winding rivers by strings of
h sweating men, who are paid only 8
cents a day for their work and have to
pay their board out of that small sum. I
s Next in cheapness to transportation by 1
f junk is transportation by camel team.
te This method is used in distribultng
d coal. &reat numbers of Mongolian
ic camels, led by a string through their
pierced noses and tied one to the other,
te each carrying two baks of coal strung
h across their backs between the humps,
are to be seen winding their way from
the coal mines to the larger cities in
northern China and covering with
te their swinging steps about twenty
is miles a day.
