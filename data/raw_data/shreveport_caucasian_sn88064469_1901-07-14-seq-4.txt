THE BUSY WOMAN.
She Has No Time For the Small Coas
tewlem of Life.
Need the busy woman be a bear?
Anybody would think so to watch her.
If the busy woman's sphere of activity
Is bounded by an office, she is so rush
ed that she hasn't any time for the
small courtesies of life. If any one
opens a door or hands her a book,
there is no response. Often a cheery
good morning calls forth only a blank
expression. If any one reminds her
that she is impolite, her lips close with
a pinched expression, and she mutters
cu-tly, "I'm busy." I suppose she
thinks a smile or a courteous word
would be a waste of valuable time.
That's where she is vastly mistaken.
People form their impressions of our
character from these apparently small
things, and no one can afford to be in
different to the good opinion of others.
Then, too, a smile acts on a tired brain
like a tonic; it refreshes and Invigor
ates. It is safe to say that every smile
makes a woman a second younger and
that It Is the women who seldom smile

who grow old the quickest. Afte; her
work the busy business woman rushes
home, eats a hasty meal and flies to the
seclusion of her room, where she col
lapses in an untidy wrapper and spends
the evening yawning and reading
novels. If some one asks her, why she
doesn't brace up, put on a clean gown
and enjoy the evening with some
friends who will cheer her up and give
her new ideas and fresh interest in
life, she answers "I'm too busy," or "I
haven't time," or "I'm too tired." The
truth is, she is satisfied with her own
company; she is too selfish to interest
herself in other people and too lazy to
exert herself a little to make friends.
The result is that she goes down to the
office next day discontented with life
and grumpier than ever.
The busy home woman is the same.

she is forever cleanilg, mending or
making embroidery or preserves, sad
she considers that she is doing her
duty by her husband and children. But
she never has time to listen to their
littlb troubles, and she is too busy to
make herself attractive to her hus
band, and she hasn't time to extend
those UIttle courtesies whieb make life
long friends. She is just a plain wom
an, as she will teB you, and a very
busy one, with no time for'nonsense.
Does it ever occur to the bony wom
an. I wonder, that she Is missing the
best pirt of life; that it would pay her
far better to be less active and smart
and to find time for a kind word and a
smile? Does it ever occur to that wo
man that she is turning herself into a
machine and that the best machines
break down some day? No, I suppose
not. She will have-'to reach that day
first-the day when her physical activ
ity will have deserted her, when she
will be sick or old and will so longer
be able to be busy. She will look
around for sympathetic words and
comfort, not realizing that the treasure
of friendshio is built up by continued
little acts of kindnes.s throughout the
years of one's life. Perhaps she will
wish then that she had allowed herself

ANOTHER COMBINE.
Company to Increase its Capital Stoek So
Boy and Build Mills.
New York, July 12. -A special meet
ing of the stockholders of the Virginia
Carolina Chemical company has been
called for the near future at Jersey
City to act upon a resolution of the di
rectors providing for an increase of $26,
000,000 in the authorized capital of that
corporation, thus making the total cap
ital $.50,003,000. This action is a result
of the current plans adopted in securing
cotton oil properties with a view to se
curing supplies of cotton seed meal from
which ammoniates are derived.
A circular sent to the stockholders by
the dire'tars set forth that the company
has been figuring a long time on some
plan by which it could secure the am
moniates, of which it consumes about
$2,000,000 worth annually, in the most
economical manner. It is pointed out
that the quantity of ammoniates alone
would justify the company in going
into the cotton seed oil business, but
aside from that it it, when properly
conducted, intrinsically profitable busi
ness and would have the further ad
vantage of placing the company more
closely in touch with the fertiliser
trade.
It is for the purpose of buying up es
tablished cotton mills, or establishing
new ones, that the capital stock of the
company is to be increased to $50,000,
000.
The United Cotton Oil somupany has
recently incorporated under New Jer
sey laws with $12,000,000 capital stook.
Presumably this concern will be turned
over to the Virginia-Carolisa Chemical
company.
The cotton oil plants, which so far as
io known, have been acquired by the
Virginia-Carolina Chemical company
include the Southern Cotton Oil com
pany, a $2,000,000 concern; the Atlantic
Refining company and the Interstate
Refining company. Several trade oil
mills are alsi said to have been pur
chased. It is also understead that the
company has options on several other
concerns, but formal ann ement of
purchase has not been mad..
ITALIANS KILLED. u
Two Are Shot to Death . IlMtstssipp
and Another Badly Wounded.
Vicksburg, July 13.-The reported
lynching of Italians at Avon, Washing.
ton county, Thursday, which was later
denied, turns out after all to be true, ex
cept as to the location. It is now pos
itively known that John and Victor
Serto, brothers, were shot to death and
Salvator Serberto probably fatally
wonoded by a mob of marked men at 3
Erwin, shortly after 12 o'clock Wed.
nesday night. There were four Italians
in the party which was attacked but
one succeeded in making his escape
unhurt.
The facts leading up to the tragedy
are somewhat conflicting, but as near
as can be ascertained the Italians wert
suspected of cattle stealing and ht
been warned to leave the neighborhood.
This they did, but returned Wednesday
having been notified by unknown par- I
ties that the trouble had blown over,
and that they would not be molested. C
As the sequel proved it was evidently a
carefully planned aesassination. Not t
suspecting any danger the Italians re
tired early Wednesday night, sleeping
in hammocks swung in the gallery of
their home. Shortly after midnight
they were aroused by a voice calling
from nearby clump of bushes and as they
arose a volley of rifle and pistol bullets I
were poured into them. The brotherb
Serio fell at the first fire, dead, pierced
by half a dozen bullets. Serberto was
dropped with a bullet through the groin
and the fourth man took to the woods
and escaped.
Governor Longino has ordered the
Washington county authorities to make
a thorough investigation.

Eight men, two of whom have bees

Davis and Newton are both in a critical

The crowd was largely composed of

eager for trouble of any sort, but doseas
of influential citizens urged the people
to go home and finally succeeded in
getting them away from the jail.
After midnight the mob began to
beat negroes about the city with wh
a quarrel could be provoked and
black men were badly beaten. A num

was injured. The crowd divided into
