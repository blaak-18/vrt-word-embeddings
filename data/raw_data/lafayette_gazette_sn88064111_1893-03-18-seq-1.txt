"' boy, yet poor frot
little Joe Bry- 4
an had scarcely dep
cnownr any 'other. He could not re- grn
member when the long waiting-rooms, to
with their tiled floors and dreary rows but
of stationary settees and crowds of Ai
burrying people, were not quite as fa- tive
. miliar to him and more homelikce than bln
his mother's small, bare house, wh.ch e
be knew as little more than a place for trai
eating and sleeping. hetl
At an age when any ordinary baby bid
might have been frightened into con- the
vulsions by the shriek of a locomotive, e
Joe, securely fastened in his cub, the
would stare for hours through the der
great window undisturbed by the in
cessant rush and roar of arriving and cot
departing trains. an
Be had been only six months oid e
when the dreadful accident happened the
which at one fll stroke made him the
fatherless and transformed him from a trn
stroig, well developed infant to a piti- net
ful creature, which even death refused rot
to take. spt
The old yardmen tell the story even
yet-low yo ang Michael Bryan, as
straight nuen d anly a fellow as ever cal
lefthis green, old, native island for the be'
bettr chances of the new world this to
side of the sea, canme whistling out of ba
the roundhouse than t morning and wi
stepped hastily from before an incom
ing locomotive, neither seeing nor ti
hearing another rushing up the paral
lel track. His mates cried out to him op
-too late! Nobody who saw it would up
ever forget the look of agony which
distorted his handsome face in that
I one horrible instant when he recog
nized his doom, or the perpendicular fli
leap into the air, from which he fell t
back beneath the crunching wheels. of
In the excitement and consternation to
of the time no messenger had been
sent in advance to prepare the poor hi
young wife for her trouble, and she
stood in the doorway vith her baby
crowing in her arms, when the stout
bearers paused at her gate with their th
mangled burden. Site uttered a tern- I at
ble cry and fell fainting-the child's
tender back striking the sharp edge of bi
the door stone.
"What a pity that it was not killed Y
outright," said everybody but the
mother. She herself always insisted fc
that only her constant watching over bi
the little flickering life kept her from 11
going mad in the first dreadful mouths t
of her bereavement.
When Joe was seven years old his
mother sent him to school. lie went
patiently day after day, making no
complaint, but she awoke suddenly one
night to find him sobbing on the pil
low beside her. Only by dint of long
coaxing was she able' to find out the
cause of his grief. Some of the rougher
boys-more thoughtless than cruel, let
us hope-had called him Ilumpy, and
nasked if he carried a bag of meal on
his back.
Mary flamed with the fie rce anger of
.motherhood.
"You shan't go another day!" site de
clared. * The ruffians! I won't have
any darlin' put upon by the likes of
them!"
So Joe's schooling had come to an
untimely end. Yet, meager as was his
stock of book learning, the develop
ment of his mind far outstripped the
growth of his stunted aind deformed
body. Everybody liked the patient
little fellow tugging manfully at his
mother's heavy water buckets and
running willingly to every call of the
station men. At twelve years old he
had picked up no small amount of in
formation, especially on railroad top- i
les. lie knew every locomotive on the
road, understood the intricacies of the I
aide tracks and switches, and could 1
tell the precise moment when any par
tipular train might be expected with
the accuracy of a time table.
Yet the very quickness and ardor of 1
his nature deepened his sense of his in
firniity. The glances cast upon him by
stranger eyes, some pitiful, some cu
rious, others, alas! expressive only of
annoyance and disgust, rankled like so
many arrows in his heart; not one
missed its mark. Ilow wistfully his
eyes followed boys of his own age
.e straight, handsome, happy-who sprang
lightly up and down the steps of the
coaches, or threaded their way along
the crowded platforms. For one day
of such a perfects untrammeled life he
would have bartered all the possible
Syears before him. Yet he never put
his yearnings into words, even to his
mother.
- "'Crooked Joe's a rum'an," said one of
his roulghl aequaintances. "lie senses
his trouble well enough, but he don't
let on to nobody."
Mr. Cramp, the telegraph operator,
was Joe's'constant friend. It was he
who, at odd moments, had taught the
boy to re'iad and had initiated him
into some-of the myst',ries of the
-clicking inptument, which to Joe's
imaginative mind seemed some strange
creature with a hidden life of its own.
- It was Towing toward dark one No
vembter aternoon. Joe-never an un
welcome visitor-sat curled in a corner
of Mr. Crump's office waiting for his
mother to fintsh her work. lie was la
boriously spelling out by the faded
light the words upon a page of an illus
trated. newspaper, quite oblivious of
the ticking, like' that of a very jerky
and rheumatic clock, which sounded in
the room. -
* r. Crump, too, had a paper before
him, but his ears were alive. Suddenly
- he sprang to.his feet, repeating aloud
thi mressge -wih that ml "ent 4@**4

He rushed to the door, shouting the P1
news.lo
"Not a second to spare! She'll be
down in seven minutes." Or
The words passed like lightning. In asa
a moment the yard was in a wild com- of t
motion. Men flew hither and thither, but
yard engines steamed wildly away, the deep
switches closing behind them. the 1
The main track was barely clear ly
when 110 came in sight, swaying from more
-side to side, her wheels threatening to Ti

from view in a cloud of smoke. whi
Some hundred yards beyond the
depot the track took a sharp upward they
grade, from which it descended again app:
to strike thp bridge across a narrow TI
but deep aidd rocky gorge. thai
Men looked after the flying locomo- thrc
tive and then at each other with que
blanched faces. nest
The crowd began to run along the
track, some with a vain instinct of
helpfulness, some moved by that mor- som

PUGILISTS SHAKE HANDS.
But Their Sualsequent Actions Seem to In. In TI
diente Insineerity.
Ordinarily the handshake is regarded No
as an evidence of friendliness oni the part ing
of those who perform the operation, Amo
but when two pugilists, prepared for a tionf
desperate contest, clasp each other by num
the hand the action looses all its friend- mal
ly significance and becomes nothing Y(
more than a hollow mockery. exhi
Two men have igned articles to fight who
to a finish, which means until one or rion
the other has been pummeled so hard TI
as to be unable to continue. Each is nam
determined to inflict as much physical fron
injury on his opponent as is possible, and
with a due regard for the rules under 01
which they battle, and yet before they are
begin the work of battering each other orcl
they shake hands with a great show of In
apparent friendliness. sple
The spectators are of course aware min
that the fighters are simply going key.
through a form, and that the subse- ordi
quent battle will lose none of its fierce- the
ness because of the show of temporary spid
good feeling. nesi
While the preliminary handshake is A
somewhat farcical the ceremony per- Iind
formed at the close of thecontest is the tudi
most pronounced burlesque. WVhen the in Ii
last round is over, the exhausted com- deve
batants are dragged to their corners by form
their seconds, and the work of spong- in 1
ing and rubbing the fighters goes on run
vigorously. sus]
Meanwhile the referee, with knotted den
brow, is pacing about the ring endeav- 1I
oring to decide which had the best of thi:
the encoun-r, and where a figl t has tab
been close this is no easytask. Iiav- to t
ing decided, the referee whispers to the bee
announcer, and'the latter holds up his carl
hand as a signal for quiet, and when bro
the buzz of talk has ceased the an- gre
nouncer says: "The referee decides that tivi
Bangs has won the fight." 11
Thereupon there is a loud yell from An
the persons who bet their money on on
B angs, while those who wagered cash of 1
on the other fellow express their dis- the
approval with hisses. The referee has sus
become used to that sort of thing, and or
he merely smiles at the hisses. It is onl
when the announcer has spoken the
name of the victor that the pugilists cei
become objects of exceeding interest. me
WVhile waiting for the decision the
contestants, if not too badly injured, ite
sit with their necks craned forward in
an effort to catch the first word. When '
the successful man hears his name jp(
spoken he springs from his chair, and
with a look of extreme pleasure on his of
bruised and bleeding face, rushes across cl
the ring to the corner where his op- gh
h ponent sits, seizes the hand of the lat- sti
n ter, and wrings it with an air of the
n greatest cordiality. ph
The defeated pugilist sits sullen and wp
disappointed. lie feels that lie has fri
been robbed by the referee, and he ki
permits the other fellow to do all tile i
hand-shaking. As a matter of fact,
the winner does not shake hands be- V
d cause of a friendly feeling for his de- lil
feated opponent, his action being more so
Sin the nature of a spontaneous out- sa
burst of exultation over his own vic- va
tory. sai
' Occasionally, where one of the con
e testants is completely knocked out, the yi
victor simply shakes the nerveless hand bi
of his victim and climbs out of the to
ring. th
The few minutes between the time G
that the contestants enter the ring and
the beginning of the fight are full of
interest. The pugilists sit in their T
corners, and before each stands a see
ond, who flaps a towel in a lazy sort of
way in front of the fighter's face.
The principals have coats thrown G
over their bare shoulders, in order that I
they may not become chilled before
hostilities commence. Then the work S
of putting on the gloves begins. The p
seconds first push the hair away from o
the back of, the glove, just over the h
knuckles, after which they pull it on e
the hand, and tie it at the wrist, so h
there is no possibility of a slip.
Then the announcer says the specta
tors will have to stop smoking or the
fight will not go on. With a general
growl cigars are smudged, upon which
ce the referee looks at the men and asks
per if they are ready. A nod in the aflirma

A COQUETTE IN DEATH.
The Skin of Her Shoulderas equeathed
to Flammarlon. getlt
Camille Flammarion, the well-known salt
astronomer, was some years ago a to
guest at the country seat of a certain fres
count and countess. The countess islig
of foreign origin and her husband's and
seat is in the department of the Jura. Ser
She was dying with consumption and mah
became deeply impressed with Flam- can
marion's accounts of his scientific Goo
flights to sidereal regions. She became
imbued with his theory of the plurality it w
of the inhabitable worlds. This en
abled her to await the inevitable end `hl
of her disease with calm resignation, wit,
perhaps with the hope that death
might only prove a translation to Macs ices
or some other planet of the celestial
world.
In due time Flammarion's visit came Thc
to an end. lie returned to his observa- the
tory and forgot in the absorption of his
astronomical studies all about his
hostess at the chateau among the of
mountains of Jura. Some time ago a cuP
package arrived at the observatory. nc
conmpanied by a letter in a black-edged 1i.
envelope. T'he packet and letter were
received by nlme. Flammarion.who, on kee
examing the contents, found that the the
package contained a large piece of but
white skin, very thick and cold to the tia
touch. The letter, which was in French, ly;
read as follows: ells
DEAR MAsrER:-I am fulfilling the last wish
of one who bore a strange love for you. She -
made me swear to send you on the day after sea
her deth th e skin of her lxautiful 'sboulders. inc
which you admired so much. she said. on the
evening of your departure. It was htr desire th
that you should have bound in thls skin Ihb sal
first copy of the first book you may publish pao
after bhr death. I transmit to you, dear mas
ter. this relic, as I took my oath that I would.
This letter was signed by a well- an
known medical practitioner of Jura. m
"As a matterof fact," said Flammarion, ce
"I had admired the beautiful shoulders pu
of the countess the evening I last saw ba
her, and when she was in decollete

` ONE h.CURCE OF EVIL.

I- Thinking well of a person is one of
SI the best aids that can be given him to
ii- lead him on toward well-doing. One
re reason why there are so many bad boys
- in the- world is because the phrase "bad
S iboy" has so rooted itself in the popular
t. thought, toward all boys. A child of
ra live years not long ago shrewdly ob
rS served: "'People don't know that lit
le tie children are good, unless they keep
in them. Why, mamma, people always
ets think children are bad until they live
p' with them; then they find out they
ny they can be good." A child
.ven at that early age, had seen enomugh
of the world to know that the prevail
ing disposition is to take it for grant:d
So that a child can have no spontaneous
ith promptings to right, no noble aspira
of tioas to goodness. no praiseworthy mo
ct Lives to action. And yet she knew that
ced upon fair trial, without prejudice, the
mon %tprld might reverse its hard judgment.
or- The rule applies through all ages and
rlcs conditions. One reason why so many
)ro- ec-convicts are untrustworthy is be
le ause they know that no one trusts
be them: bad boys are bad because they
1c- are taught that badness is a necessary
ion constituent of boyhood. Children and
of men lund it easier to do evil when evil
ng. s expected of themn. Conversely, they
aud find it easier to do good when good is
-ly looked for in them.-S. S. Times.

mast The amount of money which may be
Sspent on an apparently neat and simple
f susit, at least to the inexperienced, is
om- enough to cast a gloom over the home
of small income. "'Why don't you have
Ssome such suits as thlat?"' asked a man
of his wife as a woman sat down op
arone posite in the car. The suit was a dark
fore green cloth, the material of which
the might have cost three or four dollars a
rote yard. Round the bottom of the skirt
rich was a three-inch band of Russian sable
nrot headed with jet. The jacket had wide
by revers and cuffs of the same costly fur,
ad. and as she threw back the jacket fronts
ad. thle waist was trimmed with some. The
r making was not ,less than one hundred
rle dollars probably, and fur was consider
oallv mnore. No wonder the wife, in a
