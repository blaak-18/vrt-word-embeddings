The Megro as ait Elector.
We of tho South, have to (leal
with oue of tho most.grave and se
rious political problems, that was
ever presented lor solution to a peo
ple, in the history of the world.
A problem that tasks the ingenuity
of the political economist, and tests
the sagacity of the sagest of histor
ical reasoncrs. Freed from foreign
and extraneous influences, the ques
tioa would present no great diffi
culty, and would long ere now,
have been settled upon a basis that
would have proved mutually benefi
cial and satisfactory to tho negro
and hi« old master. With the clo
sest ot real interests to cement their
business intercourse, the negro
would not have been slow to reefcy
nize bis true friehds, and tho peo
ple of tho South would readily
have proved the sincerity of their
sympathy for their former slaves,
but for the interference of adventu
rers from the North, better known
as carpet-baggers j and of unprinci
pled renegades at home, called for
.short, scalla-wags.
The political influence of tho re
cently enfranchised negro, was a
prize too great not to tempt their
avarice and Cupidity, and as soon
as tho echo of the last gun of the
war had died away, and the return
of peace made it safe for such tim
id vultures to venture oat of the
hiding places that had sheltered
their precious bodies, while honest
men were- fighting for principle,
they flocked to the South and com
menced to bid for negro votes, by
telling the poor simple negro, of
how they had fought for their free
dom, and how solemn was their du
ty to send them to the Legislature,
to vote for them for all the lucra
tive offices and to stick by them at
all hazards, for tho Southern peo
pie were ready to put them back
into slavery at any moment that
they might get control of the gov
ernment.
By tho constant repetition and
reiteration of such pericious false
hoods in the midnight conclaves of
the Union League, in the privacy
of the negro huts and in their
churches in the broad light of day,
the carpet-bagger and scallawag has
succeeded beyond his most sanguine
expectations in hood-winking the
poor lnegro, and in securing for
himself the coveted prize of office,
with its illegitimate pickings and
its opportunities for barefaced steal
ing It has taken the negro nine
years to learn how falso were the
preachings of Iiis quondam friends;
fh°y ' iave ^ hnind (hem
]they have thrown them!
overboard. Tho distrust of his for
mer masters engendered by the
constant and oft repeated slanders
of his pretended white friends,
threw the negro back into his own
ranks for men to fill the offices to
which their votes easily elect eu
their candidates, by reason of the
indifference of the white people ;
and having relieved us and himselt
of the burden we bore iu the ras
cality and corruption of the carpet
bagger, he gave us instead the ig
norance and incapacity of his own
color.
"In avoiding Sylla lie foundered
the ship iu Charyddis."
We infinitely prefer the negro to
the carpet-bagger and renegade,
and if we must make a choice be
tween the ignorance of the one and
the rascality of the other ; give us,
by all means the ignorance, and
we-will endeavor to educate and
instruct it into some sort of sem
blance to knowledge and reason.
Give us his Satanic Majesty and all
the imps of hell in preference to the
sneaking, whining, sleek-haired,
cowardly, ©impecunious, lying, de
ceitful aud thievish carpet-bagger,
aud his town companion, the mis
cegenation-loving, would-be-negro
and no less corrupt scallawag.
But tee dont moan to - have cither
any longer. The Sun has set upon
the ascendency of both, aud when it
rises after the nextcampaign it will
shine Tefulgentupon our once fair
State restored to her rightful ow
ners, the honest, intelligent and ca
pable white people.
The negro has no other choice
than either to take up the carpet
bagger again, and if he does, the
detection iu Lis own ranks will. de
feat his ticket ; or he must, as he
will do, run a straight out negro
ticket, and that will insure tho suc
cess of tho white people, l'or upon
that issue, every white man who
respects his name, Avho loves his
children or who feels the dignity of
his'manhood, will step promptly
to the front and assert his .respect,
his love and his dignity at the bal
lot-box. The time has not yet come
when the negro shall have master
ed the other lesson that he is now
learning, viz; that lie has not the
capacity to fuie this country.
It will not take film as long to
learn this one, as ft did for him to
find out the carpetbaggers, and
when experience, the best of teach
ers, shall have fiually taught him
this truth, he will turn of necessity
to the white people for that intelli
gence and capacity that he will ac
knowledge, he has.not himself, and
then the problem will have been
solved. The answer will "have been
pvoved, and we shall then see the
end of squabbling for negro -votes
and the negro will sink to his level
of political, as well as social insig
nificance ; except in isolated cases
where ' particular, individuals may
display capacity that fit them for
minor offices. To demand more
than this is to defy the decrees

That Jury Again.
Now that wo havo all had our
"say" about the jury drawn for the
May term of our District Court, we
want to go a little further into the
matter. Mr. W. W. Wliittington,
Jr., and oursclf wero the tw„<> qual
ified electors summonsed to assist in
tho drawing of tho Jury for the last
December term of tho Court. The
law requires two full lists of all
qualified jurors to be made at each
drawing, oue to be deposited in the
Clerk's office for inspection, and one
on ballots of uniform size and color
to go in the box to be drawn from.
These two lists were prepared by
Mr. Wliittington from the original
book of Eegistratioh of 1S72.
At the time of the drawing these
lists were called 'over and checked
by comparison with the registration
book aud found to be correct—or
all errors or omissions corrected
as each name was called from the.|
registration book the corresponding
name was checked on the Clerk's
office list and cut oft from the other
one°and if not exempt as a juror —
put into a ballot box , with slid
ing top and lock and key. After
having been well and frequently
shaken, one hundred names were
drawn by Mr: DeLacy in the pres
ence of all, with what result is well
known. These hundred names were
put in a separate box and a list
made of them as each one was
drawn out. When tho drawing was
concluded, the ballot box containing
tho names that wero left, about
thre<® thousand, c was locked and
sealed by pasting strips of paper
over the top and sides with signa
tures on them, and the box and key
were delivered into the possession
of Mr. John DeLacy, Sheriff. On
tlio çccasiau of the drawing of this
last jury, wo werö applied to by the
present Recorder, as Parish Attor
ney, to settle the question as to
whether he was to officiate or not
in the drawing. This was the first
that w r e knew that tho jury was to
be drawn or anything about the
drawing. Having answered the
question iu the affirmative, for
greater precaution, if not in posi*
tivo obedience to the 0 last jury law,
we repaired to the Court House
and found the officers and two qual
ified electors, of whom Mr. Whit
tingtou was one, assembled around
the table iu the Court röom, and
Mr. John DeLacy Sheriff, was draw
ing ballots from out of a cigar box.
We wish to do Tic. Porter the^*
credit to gay that he made Mr. Jno.
DeLaey go down stairs aud got au
other box, and after he had brought
up the Alexandria ballot box, the
largest of them all, Porter emptied
the jury ballots out ol tho cigar box
on tho table and mixed them up
well, and then having put them in
the large ballot box shook them
well again. We wish also to do jus
tice to tho Parish Judge who we do
not believe was knowing to any
fraud, and Messrs Calvit and Wliit
tington, whom wo are certain did
not even suspect sucji a thing. Mr
Calvjt was checking the names on
the registration book and* Mr.
Wliittington was making a list of
the names as they were drawn.
Wo know nothing of any of the
prior proceedings, of our own
knowledge, and eau't say whether
the other officers took steps to veri
fy the box presented to them by Mr
DeLaey, but wo do know that wheu
they were given to Mr. DeLacy
they were in a hallot box, locked
and sealed, as stated above, and
that they were being drawn from a
cigar box when we got iu the^room,
and that tho ballots were tho same,
as we learned by enquiry there and
they were in Mr. Whittington's
writing as the December ones were.
We were told iu answer to a ques
tion there, during the drawing, that
ofpo new lists had been made and
they wero drawing from the
old ones, having corrected them.
Now, we exouerato everybody
else concerned, because we witness
ed it and know that the mere draw
ing was fair, but until Mr. John
I DeLaey Sheriff, can and does ex
I plain to us, why, how, when and
wherefore, the jury ballots got out
0 f that hallot box locked and sealed
and got into that cigar box, and
how it happened fairly that there
is such a large discrepancy between
the color of the two juries drawn
from the same ballots, with the ad
dition of only about one hundred
and ten names—we do charge up
on him and those we suspect to be
privy to the fraud, the bare
faced fraud of taking tlio names of
duly qualified white electors oiit of
the jury box.
The time is past when we of this
country mean to tamely submit to
any sue, h fraud upon our rights.
If Mr. DeLacy can explain the
matter, the columns of the Caucas
ian are^open to him freely and gra
tuitously; wo will not willingly do
injustice even to him who has done
5o muclv injustieo^to our people, but
if he is guilty he must shoulder the
responsibility. We intend to ex
pose fraud wherever we find it, aud

It is the duty of every property

Editor Caucasian :
Deak S ib :—Permit me a small
space iu the columns of your papçr.,
I believe that your paper, sir, vin
dicates aud gives justice to all men
regardless of race or color, and that
it does and will expose aud con
demn ignorance and corruption
wheresoever it is found, and I hope
that through your paper aud by
the intelligent portion of this com
munity I will get justice, aud be
regarded as having done my duty
as a primary School teacher to the
best of my ability, as beneficial to
the race from which I am alienated.
I see in the Louisiana Democrat
an article published against me, by
the Hou. W. L. Ambler, [colored].
He very courteously states that the
School which is under my charge
and control, is governed by one
who is incompetent, and that he
and others' wero compelled to with
draw their children from this School
for lear of "contamination" as he
styles it. He further" states that I
expelled from this School his neice
Laura and others, and that said
expulsion was simply to revenge a
prejudice which".I had toward him
and others. Now, sir, these char
ges, I musk boldly contradict. So
far as incompetency is concerned,
the gentleman aud his accomplices
are mistakeu, I am fully prepared
and ready to prove my competency
by an examination whenever called
upon by him or auy of his colleague.
1 have been examined iu the
presence of men that are intellectu
al and educated. But, sir, I have
never professed to be a Grammari
an nor master of Mathematics, and
as the gentleman is desirous of hav
ing a Professor ot these branches,
and having failed to get his carpet
bag accomplice iu the position that
I now occupy, I think he had better
take it himself. I am bold to say
that I did not seek to force myseif
upou the School Boayl fora posi
tion that I was unable to fill nor do
I do so now, but I believe that I
am better qualified to till tliis posi
tion as primary teacher, than are
the gentleman or his accomplices in
their nefarious scheme, to till the
position as a legislator in this en
suing campaign which tlioy thought
by my removal they cot Id carry.
No', sir; the prejudice which lie
claims to exist or. my part, is just
on the other hand. When Prof. F.
G. Cumming sojourned here and
after making his remarks upon
topics that were calculated to kin
dle strife and envy iu the minds of
men, as all such carpet-baggers do,
aud cause people of a community
to be at war with ouo another, and
because I disagreed with their ac
tions and seeiet combinations and
motives, then, sir began this preju
dice. The moment they saw they
coukl not lead me into their lair ot
corruption, they then commenced
their w?r upon me. They petition
ed for my removal ; in that they
failed, and then Mr. W. L. Ambler
and others withdrew their children
from the School in order to break
it. up so that I would be compelled
to retire.
Those children were kept from
my School until the 2nd of April
1871, when they reappeared for ad
mission. . During this lapse of time
other scholars were placed upon
my Poll or Begister occupying
those seats, which had "become va
cant by tho withdrawal of said
children, and sir, you must remem
ber that in' a room 12 by 14 feet

note to Mrs. llines, which I see in
publication. He says he is tired of
such wrongs, and oppressions;
Why then did not so wise and so
intellectual a man as himself see
this error previous to the combina
tion of his ring? No, he, thought
as did Iiis colleagues, that 1 could
be led into secret doings but not
so—what I am, I act openly, and
not secretly.
And so far as commencing his
suit is concerned, he can commence
it as soon as he sees fit; for -I am
prepared to meet him in a court of
justice or anyway he wants. He
lias perjured himself already; He
told a member of this Board that his
niece Merer came to my school, then
how is it that 1 could expell a child
that never was in school ? As for
myself I can exonerate the gentle

Editor Caucasian:—
Sir :—Noticing yonr call for com«
munications throughout the Parish,
I have thought a line or two from the
outskirts might, if not of any advan
tage to your publication, be condu
aire to the-w®lfare of the denizens ol
a large Bcope of country in thi^ re
gion.
In the first place, what is of tho
greatest importance to any commu
nity, a convenient depot for the re
ceipt of mails, calls us to a hope that
some provisions may be made to
enable ns to receive letters and pa
pers without having to travel from
twenty to fifty miles, or be under the
necessity of calling npon the local
store-keepers, who do occasionally
visit, our Parish seat, to take with
him an extra mule, with enormous
saddle-bags to convey to us, ot to
his place of business for as,- our news
papers and letters which may have
accumulated in the Post Ofiice. For
instance a batch of newspapers and
letters was Bhown me by one. pf these
store-keepers, addressed to his enre
for citizens living at distances from
his place of business, varying from
five to twenty miles; those of coarse,
living nearer, having received their
papers. To say nothing of the good
nature which prompted said store
keeper to act as voluntary mail rider
for this large scope of country. I
would suggest that were the facilities
for the distribution or delivery of the
mails hereabouts greater, the induce
ments for subscribers to enroll them
selvesHmong the patrons of the Cau
casian, would be thereby increased;
and where one now appears, five or
ten would come into ranks.
In fuct, Mr. Editor, our news fa
cilities are somewhat after this stlye:
Scene— Before or after charch—at
blacksmith shop or country store.
Enter first neighbor; three or a dozen
others waiting their turn. "Well,
what's tho news? Second neighbor.
"Not mncli, J. says that G. went to
town— Alexandria—last week and
saw merchant, Mike, Moses ok Bill—
H. said that cotton was worth so much
—meat was high and getting higher,
that red river would soon overflow
its bariks if it did not fall; and that
he heard a man say that a man from
New Orleans said that there was to
be a new election soon, etc.
Now, although Mike, Moses, Billy
H., and the man from New Orleans,
may be first rate authority, I agree
with the community here, that think
themselves entitled to a more speedy
and direct news route than what they
have said, retailed second or third
handed two or thrco weeks there
after.
Various attempts have been mado
to got a mail route through this "sec
tion Petitions signed by a string of
citizens, who would bo enough to
make a company if not a regiment,
have been forwarded to the Third
Assistant P. M. General, without any
effect or notice.
The oft repeated rains in the conn
Iry have been no little.obstucle to tho
planters in planting their crops—
though many havo corn and cotton
both up and doing well, but for sot
back received by tho weather.
Yours,

!
A Queer Oitkjeii .—Passing up
front street on Thursday, wo saw
a negro with handcuffs on sitting by
the side of a white man in front of
tho Excelsior Saloon. A close in
spection revealed tho fact that tho
negro was the one who. some weeks
ago killed another man of his own
co'or in Grant parish and who had
since been lodged in our parish jail ;
aud the further fact, that his keeper
was drunk and getting more so all
tho time.
On enquiry wo learned that the
officer was a Mr. Shelby, Deputy
Sheriff of Grant Parish, and that ho
was conveying the prisoner to Colfax
for trial on tho charge of murder.
Wo aro informed that subsequently
the officer got so drunk as to have to
be carried to his room and that he
refused any offers of assistance in
guarding his prisoner and declined to
place him back in jail for safe keep
ing during the night. More than
this, that while he was drunk in his
room, he sent tho prisoner down
stairs for l'quor, water Äc.
Mr. Fellows proposed tp lock the
door but Mr, Shelby declined to
allow it. These facts are stated to
us by gentlemen whose statements
arc reliable in every particular, and
show a rather queer way of doing
business in guarding prisoners charg
ed with grave crimes. If that pris
oner did not make Jiis escape it
was his own fault, for ho certainly
had the opportunity.
