Interest in the state has been fo
cusel upon the strike on the Georgia
railroad which has for the
past week assumed each
day a more serious aspect,
causing a complete disorgani-

zation of freight, passenger and final
ly mail trains. It is all the outcome
of a growing dissatisfaction on the
part of the white employees of the
road at the policy of filling the ser
vice with negroes, particularly in the
capacity of firemen. The operation
of railroads and running of trains are
things which the average citizen is not
very familiar, but none questions the
truth that the lives of every passen
ger, railway mail clerk and employe
on every train are in the hands of
the engineer. His responsibility is
tremendous. The schedules he must
remember and the burdensoihe mental
details he must carry every moment of
his run are realized only by those who
have some practical knowledge of the
work. It is not simply opening the
throttle and blowing a whistle with
which he has to deal, as many vague
ly suppose. In hardly any sense is
his work manual.
Engineers are but human, despite
their heroic record, and no man may
say when he may be stricken by sud
den illness or disability or even death
in the midst of his run. This has
been so clearly recognized from a
number of such instances as to lead to
agitation for the employment of two
capable engineers upon every passen
ger train, to be prepared for such em
ergencies. Fancy, then, the case of an
engineer having to rely upon a negro
fireman in any moment of stress. The
negro can’t help the fact that he is
at best but a grown up child, irrespon
sible, incapable of meeting the de
mands of any position of serious re
sponsibility. Within the recent past
one or two terrible wrecks have oc
curred, because a negro, sent on to
flag a train, sat down, and went into
the characteristic African snooze while
the cars thundered by to doom. By
all means, every engineer should have
in his fireman a true, dependable, at
tentive assistant. The very admission
on the part of the officials of the
road that the negro fireman can nev
er become an engineer—the recogni
tion of his complete unfitness for sucn
work —proves that he should never be
a fireman. The whole system is wrong,
from the standpoint of safety and ef
ficiency, to say nothing of the unwis
dom of any condition which tends to
bring about any suggestion of social
equaliy. Further, so far as economy
is concerned, one would almost venture
to say that a negro fireman will waste
more coal, from inability so grasp the
inciples of maintaining even heat,
than any lowering in wages would
possibly counterbalance. In Prussia,
totally free from any “race preju
dice” the negro has been tried in the
army and found wanting; our loving
government, in an effort to open the
door of opportunity to the blacks via
the postal service, is grinning and
bearing what is recognized generally
to be lowered efficiency throughout
me entire south and the sooner all the
railroads in the South eliminate the
negro from every position of responsi
bility, the sooner will we have decent
schedules, because steam will be kept
up and no time lost, and fewer wrecks
due to over-tired white employees who,
in addition to their own work, must
cope with the carelessness and stupid
ity of the black.
An editorial from Mr. Watson on
the strike situation is expected, but
owing to the fact that mail from
Thomson to Atlanta must now come
by a very indirect route, it may not
arrive in time for this issue.

Same old game. And meantime, the

So ends a famous ease, particularly
in army circles. It is evident that
the “unwritten law” has been trusted
too far and that the Courts, respon
sive to public sentiment, are going to
put a quietus upon indiscriminate kill

highly subsidized attorneys for the

least seventy-five per cent
of all the lead mined—
namely, the Guggenheimers

Spanish Association of Producers, the

Prices are to be advanced from $68.75

even more! The total increase in
prices—'at the conservative estimate
of not more than the charge of SIOO
per ton —will aggregate the yearly
sum of about $225,000,000.
And now mark: On May tenth, the
Senate declined to yield to the will
of the house for a slight reduction
in the duty on pig lead. There are
but two men who could satisfactorily
explain the necessity of protecting a

Eleven Republicans voted against the

enough lead to make a hefty counter

is startling to read such
sentences as these:
W. W. Ramsey, former National
Bank president, convicted of bribery,
one year and six months’ imprison
ment and a fine of SI,OOO.
Oapt. John F. Klein, Councilman,
two years and a fine of SI,OOO on the
bribery conviction, and one year and
six months on the conspiracy convic
tion.
Joseph C. Wasson and William
Brand, former Councilmen, each one
year and six months and a fine of
SSOO for conspiracy.
H. M. Bolger, hotel keeper, two
years and a fine of SSOO for bribery.
Charles Colbert and John Colbert,
convicted of attempting to bribe a
jury in the Ramsey bribery case, two
years and a fine of SSOO each.
This by no means concludes the list
of the guilty, whose number is in the
neighborhood of at least eighty “graf
ters,” of various descriptions, all
either givers, or takers, of bribes.
These convictions are the outcome
of work done by the voters’ League,
of Pittsburg, which had quietly pur
sued a line of investigation for some
time, finally obtaining indisputable
evidence that W. W. Ramsey, presi
dent, and A. A. Vilsack, cashier of
the Pittsburg German American Bank
had bribed certain councilmen to have
their bank designated as a depository
of the city funds, at a rate lower
than that offered the city by otther
competent banks. Once the ball star
ted rolling, it gathered up nearly the
whole body of city fathers, and
others.
All the men sentenced, with the ex
ception of the two Colberts applied
at once for writs of supersedeas,
which were granted, and applicants
admitted to bail. Whether they will
ever pay their fines, or serve any
portion of their sentences, is, of
course, a question of local firmness
to properly pursue these cases, but
it is reasonably certain that the case
in any event will prove a strong de
terrent to similar practices in future.
