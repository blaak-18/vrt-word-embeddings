Three were taken out by the firemen, e
one of whom was dead. the others are I

eal that some twelve or more remain I
in the building without hope of ros- t
cue. The building was destroyed by I
the shock anid the flames burst out in J
every direction. The firemen are I
playing on the bricks so they can look
for bodios. Most of the employees a
are accounted for. Some buildings on
the opposite side of the street caught t
fire but were put out.

Flatform of the Pennsylvani . r
Democratic Convention. V
Erie, Pa., September 10.-On re- a
assembling at 3 o'clock p. tm.. the 1
committee on resointions reported 1
the following platform : it
Resolved tirst, That we hereby de- n
clara our unfaltering devotion to thie :
fiundamental primciles, of tihe Demo. ii
cratic government as enunciated by ti
Thomas Jelferson in his first inaugn- (
ra) address ; equal and exact justice e
to all of whatsoever State or 1'erana.- U
sion, religious or political ; the sup- 1,
port of State govermaeuts in all thelr i,
rights as the most competent admuin- t
istration for our domesticr cowoermn4,,
and the surest bulwark against anti- a
Republican tendencies ; satpremnecy
of civil 'over military authority;
economy in pubnlic expmnse, that la
bor may be lightly bIur:ened ; honest
pasyment of our jnust debts and sacred h
preservation of p~mlic faith; free
dom of religion, freedom of the press, i
and freedom of person, under th i
protection tif habeas corpus and trial hi
by jury,
Secnmd, That the widespread de. e
precsion and suffering which affect
every business and employment ca
pable of being touched by legisla- 7
tion show beyond donht the igno
rance, inefficiency and wickedness of
the leaders of the party that has
ruled State and nation for a period of
years and calls for the immediate and
permainent retirement from thie places
which they have so long dishonored i
and disgraced.
Third, That the undue multiplica
tion of public officers and the inor
dinate increase of salaries and emo
lument of office are among the manyi
evils which Radical role has for.eed
upon the country, and favoring an
economical administration of(' the
Federal and State governmventta, so
people may be relieved from the I
burdens of taxation with which they
are now seriously op,'ressed. We
call on our Federal amrld State repre
sentatives to strive by all proper
means to reduce 'tem to the very
lowest practica'ole number a n d
amount.
Fourth refers to State affairs, fifth
and sixth di cto.
Seventh, That the contraction of
currency heretofore made'by the Re
Iublics¼, party and further contrac
tion "1roposed by it with a view to
foreed resumption of specie payment
hbs already brought 'disaster to the
eaosiness of the country and threatens
general bankruptey ; we demand that
this policy be.abandoned and the vol
niumne of money be made and -kept
equal to the wants of trade, leaving
the restoration of legal tenders to par
in gold to be brought about by pro
moting the industries of the people
and not by dstroying them.
Eighth, that the podicy a!ready in
itiated by the leplublican p:rrty of
abolishing legal tenders and giving
the National Banks the power to fur.
nishl all the currency. will increase
the power of an already dangerous
monopoly amnd tile enormons burdens
now oppressing the people without
compensatiug advantage, and that
all tile Natiolnl lBank circulation be
promptly and plerimanently retired
and full legal tenders issued in tlleir
place.
Ninth, that the pnblic interest de
nlands that the Government should
cease to discredit its .,wn money, and
make legal tendters receivable for all
dues, except where respect for obli
gation of contracts requires payment
in coin.
Tenth, Extinction of present Na
tional Banks and tile establishnmentm
of a system of free banks of discount
and deposit under such reguihtions as
thie States respectively may prescribe,
and no paper money except such as
may be issued directly and upon the
faith of thie Federal Government, af
fording practically a currency base on
gold and silver and other property of
time whole people of the country.

It often happens that eggs will get
frozen so as to crack the shells in he,

to sell; but if they are kept froten
until needed for use, and then brought
into a warm room and boiling water
poured over them, th en left till cool.
the egg will be uninjured, and will
beat as niicely as if it had not been
chilled, aind is just as good for any
use. After being onice thawed, it

A nlic STr .-The sting of a bee
is naturally more violent than a
wasp's, antd with some persons is at

alwaya left in the wound; that of a

more than ones. but H ee cannot.
When a person is stung by a bee let
the sting be instantly pulled out, for
the lohnger it remains in the flesh the
