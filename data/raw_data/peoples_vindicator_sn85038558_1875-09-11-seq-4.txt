WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champios American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by acorps of the best Ameri
can artists, and cotributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established hbmorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
ly. Still contiuuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater successe than
before, and was recognized as thr ablest
and brightest of its elas. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellow, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it- always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while, its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as.po word or illustration
will appear thdlian offend the most fas
tidious.

Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg.
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAIL BIT
TEns'1" Our answer is, that they
remove the causeo of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of tha system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vii
so.a Birrans in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.

treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari

There is no cathartic for the purpose
