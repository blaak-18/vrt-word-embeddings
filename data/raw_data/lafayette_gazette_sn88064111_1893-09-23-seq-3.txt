Captured Afterjs} Exciting Chase
Sheriii Broussard last Thursday morning
captured a negro fugitve from justice after
a most exciting chase. The negro who
gave his name as Geo. D. Morton, had visited
Biossat's jewelry store to have a watch re
paired and while there acted in a very sus
picious manner and gave evidence of an un
easy frame of mind. Sheriff Broussard on
be.pg informed of the matter began asear=h
for the man, who had in the meantime re
tired to Jake Brown's cabin in Mouton's
Addition. The officer proceeded thither
and on approaching noticed a negro boy
stadisg sent~ee, disappeared in great
haste toward the rear of the house. By the
time the sheriff arrived the negro fugitive
had fled through a back way and was quite a
d(stsrce awyay. The pursuit now began in
earnest, the sheriff discharging several pis
tol shots to cause his man to heave to, but
all in vain, The negro finally took refuge
an Mr. Jean Vigneauc's field and continued
for some time to evade the sheriff by dogd
ing about in the high weeds. Our plucky
Sheriff a last worked his "rabbit foot" suc.
cessfully put his man under arrest, although
the latter lad two "rabbit foots" in his
pocket. The sheriff found a Colt's pistol,
38 calibre and alirge valise filled with clothes,
a watch and several smaller articles of jew
elry in possession of Ihis prisoner, whom he
believes to be Jeff Gibbs of Copiah county,
Miss., and wanted for the murder of J. C.
Davis in October, 1892. The negro claimed
snt he was from - East Tetas, a brakeman
by avocation and a mnember of the Brother
hood'of Railway Trainmen whose badge he
wore. The representations however are
deemed false and the sheriff will hold
Morton, until he ascertains positive informs.
tions as to his Jrimes or misdeeds.
Carencro News.
From Our Resu Coonespondeta.
The article of the Lafayette Ad
veatiser replying to our little "pleas
tnry" .orpcerning their "*parish
map," has dadlgen~4~ our powder
and spiked our guns5 asd we .acicept
the very satisf~.cry :explsation
in the spirit in which. it is offered.
-It eas a merr'y party that
asailed themselves of the pl.asent
weather to visit the [Un'Ron pjanta
tion a few days. It consited of Mr.
and Mrs. O. P. Guilbeau, Mr. and
Mrs. Odon Guldry, Mesdgmes G.
H. Guilbeaa, Ludovic Guilbeau,
and Maurice Francez. On arrival ;t
the plantation, these ladies and gen
tlemen were very cordially received
by Mr. Bradford Knapp, super
intendent, whoseemed to take much
pleasure in escorting them around
the place, showing and describing
to them the workings of the compa- I
ny's great refinery. They returned
where they: visited friends. They
d passed a most enjoyable day.
-The following from the pen
" of the Rayne, correspondent in the
e last issue of The Ranger, affords
food for meditation: "Last week I
- noticed ' cotip was hauled to 4
s gin almost in ~ie corporation limits,
there ginned, and the cotton seed
r hauled to CarQncro, twenty miles
or more away, to find a purchaser,
and while our merchants were of
fering only 63 cents, cotton sold
for 7 tj cents t the place just men
tioned, a difference of only one
t cent." Why certainly, brother,
and when a difference of one cent
means a clear gain of $5 per bale,
you should not be surprised that
Carencro looms up as the best cot
ton market in the parish. Our far
mers can rest assured that they will
always get the "*top market" prices
for both cotton and cotton' seed,
as well as for all their other pro
duce. We give you our sympathy,
if you will only:.glve us your cotton,
and you will profit thereby.
-Miss Aranide Guilbeau, of

respondent has it from reliable au
thority that if the Breaux Bridge
people do their part, which is not
,so very much, they will sure ac
complish their object. Should this
be done, there is' no doubt that a
refinery will by established there.
The Breaux Bridge committee is
composed of the following influen

Sunday. Owing to a disagreement
between the "'scorers" of the re

vided. As in alisuch cases neither
side was erjtented; and your

to insert the following "defi" in the
Carencro column:

To the Editor of The Gazette:
I will again 'try to interest the
readers of The Gazette, which is the
most popular paper in South West
Louisiana.
The weather has been good and
favorable to our small crop of rice.
Corn and cotton are very good, but
more or less damaged by the recent
storm.
The writer had the pleasure to
attend the grandest and most pleas
urable picnic of the season, It was
given by our Temperance Union at
Indian Bayou last Saturday. Four
of the unions were there, each one
marching under its banner and sing
ing beautiful temperance songs,
presenting a truly grand scene. All
the unions married to the church,
where appropriate remarks were
made by Messrs. Howard Huffpauir,
Tom Spell, Odes Huffpauir, Brother
Toler, and the Rev. Mr. Drake of
Crowley, and S. W. Nickle, president
of Union No. 34 of Duson,
Brother Toler gave a splendid il
lustration of the amount that is annu
ally expended for alcoholic drinks,
which is something like $9,ooo,ooo.
This is almost double the amount
expended for any one article of food,
After a short addressed on the
subject of temperance by the Rev.
Mr. Drake the people departed for
their respective homes all seeming
well pleased and satisfied with a day
well spent,
Let us hope that th,:se unions will
succeed in making many converts to
the cause of terupet-n.c and bid
them go4Gspeg4 in th.r noble efforts
in fighting the whisJy .evil
