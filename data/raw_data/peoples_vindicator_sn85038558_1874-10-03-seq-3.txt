by fraud and force, because le want
ed the electoral vote of the State,
which a majority of the voters had
given to the other side. That wick
-ed deed has broughttforth a full crop
of crimes. We have seen him dis
persing a legislature at the point of
the bayonet, expelling a legitimate
government with threats of martial
law and reversing the course of jus
tice by the scandalous support of a
perjured court. His own friends
have exclaimed at the iniquity of
these proceedings and warned him to
desist. The hottest partisans of his
admin istration have denounced the
wicked usurpations of Kellogg and
I)utell with an indignation that does
thenl credit. Seventeen Repuhli
can Senators voted i4 February, 1873,
to declare the pretended election of
Kellogg null and void, and to turn
himt out of oflice. The President him
self finally admitted-in a special mles
sage to Congress that so many forge
ries and frauds had been discovered
that he was not sure of Kellogg's ti
tle ; an official investigation proved
the rascality of the whole transaction
beyond any possibility of denial, but
the President would not halt; he
must carry out his original crime to
its natural consequences, and the in
exoralble logic of events has led him
to this crowning shame. For the first
time in the history of the" United
States the soylier 'of the Union are
employed to drive out a legitimate
Governor and place a miserable pre
tender in the State-house to shoot
down in the streets the people who
may refuse to obey him. For this
disgraceful and disheartening spec
tacle the Congress which refuses to
act on the Louisiana report, and the
Republican party which tacitly ap
proved the wrong, are both to blame;
but it is upon the President that the
chief responsibility must rest ; the
President, who began the long course
of oppression; the President who
could have stopped it at any moment
if he hadl chosen, and could stop it
now; the President, who is probably
the only man in America not ashamed
of tlhe whole business, and who comies
forward in the midst of it asking for a
third term.
The Southern IRepublican Con
vention.
REPRESENTATIVE MEN'TO BE PRESENT.
The New York Tribune, in speak
ing of the probable composition of
tile proposed Southern Republican
Convention, designed to inquire into
and report upon the condition of the
Southern States, says:
It ought not to be difficult to select
a few score of eminent Southern Re
publicans who will fnirly represent
the men "inside politics," in whose
interest they are to be nasembled.
South Carolina, of course, will send
honest John Patterson, formerly of
Pennsylvania, who can tell the peo
ple of the Union how the South has
been affronted by carpet-aggers buy.
ing seats in the Senate from her dus
ky legislators. The IIon. Franklin
J. Moses can explain the processes of
vulgar peculation, and ex-Senator
Sawyer and ex-Congressman Bowen
c:an testify as to the practice of ship
ping field-hands from the sea islands
to vote in the city of Charleston.
Alabama will have an accomplished
spokesman in the person of the Hen.
George E. Spencer, formerly of Iowa,
whoill knows more, perhaps, than any
other statesman in Alabanma about
those demoralizing bargains with the
President whiclh lhave made Southern
polit ics so unspeakably corrupt.
From Arkansas might come the Hoo.
Powell Clayton, formerly of New
York, and what he cannot tell about
fraud is not worth knowing. Texas
moight add to the list of delegates al
ready appointed he name of Senator
Flanagan, who oone of the best yliv
ing authorities C, the defects of the
Southern edtucaten system, and she
has also a fine assortment of pictqres.
que politicians like the ex-Postmaster
of Galveston, who would ornament
any select circle happy enough to se
tare their company. Louisiana breeds
Republican statesmen as her bayous
breed alligators. Kellogg, Pinch
back, Casey, Packard, Durell, War
moth, Herwig--whiat stories they
could tell if the Convention would
only resolve itself into an Experience
Meeting. What schemes of rascality
theyrcould describe; what prodigies
of registratioi, what miracles of
counting, what astounding operations
of the courts, what novel .political
uses for revenue cutters, what inge
nions devices for tfleecing commerce,
squeezing tax payers and emptying
the treasury into the pockets of the
faithfull All the ills that have curs
ed the South since reconstriqtion, all
the dangers that threaten her future
might be illuhtstrated in such a con
vention as this.
The assemblage. would also be a
spectacle full of suggestion for the
North. There, at one glance, wee
should see every variety of. political
parasite that feeds upon the prostrate
States, every speseaqroges vaga
bond and insolent pretender that as
made republican government at the
South a reproach to all the civilized
world.
No Compromise.
There can be no compaonisl~it this
juncture, no yielding a6f'ithitl ~ to
any interest. We cannot afford to
recogniae an any wany even the shad
ow of a right on the pdrt of the
Custom-House t6 negotiate asli teirs.
We publish the Kellogg unsurpatioa
to the world as afraad and a lie, and
demand its absolqte retreement as the
only solation of obt,Wlllties 'ts
We have prover-to, the World that
this eusurping goverament of ello-gg
cannot exist for one mobnent.without
the support of Fedral bayonets.
We have appealed to the ballot-bop
only to be defnaded: of its results,
and having been bcharged with adult
tiag that Kellogg was supportedby
the people. We have appealed to
arms, and demonstrated that his gov
ernument cannot support itself. We
swept it away at a single blow, but
the Federal power has restored it.
We have nothing left save the glo
rious half-tearful recollection of the
two sunshiny days that mark an
oasis in the desert of sorrowful years
that have come to Louisiana since
the war. But we have not lost hope.
We have been deprived of the sub
stantial results of our victory by the
strong armh of the National Goveru
ient, but we have faith in the great
heart of the American people, and
we appeal to their patriotism ; to
their devotion to liberty ; and to their
sense of right and justice for such
action as will aid us in our dire ex
tremity.
We are loyal to the United States
Government. We claim to be as
peaceable and law-abiding as any
other community. And in support of
these assertions we point with pride
to the late revolution, which has no
parallel in history.
The spectacle of a great people ris
ing in their might and overthrowing
a usurping and iniquitous govern
ment, without a single act of lawless
ness to mar the grandeur of the act,
is one not afforded to every genera
tion, and in itself furnishes the strong
est commentary on the partizan act
of the National Executive in order.
iug almost the entire army into a
peaceful State for the purpose of com
pleting the overthrow of its people in
the interests of his own political anm
bition. The plea of disloyalty is dis
posed of by the quiet surrender to
the United States Government of the
legitimate and duly elected officers of
the State-at a time when they were
in the full possession and execution
of their perogatives-and when no
other organized government or clai.
mant was on the soil of the State..
We repeat, we cannot compound
with fiaud and villainy and retain
our own self respect, much less the
respect of our fellow-country men,
who, watching the grand struggle in
Louisiana with no ordinary concern,
but as men having a personal inter
est in the result. If we weakly yield
to the alluring promises of the base
men who have trampled upon us.and
attempted to strangle free govern
ment in this State, we become our
selves, parties to a great crime against
civil liberty and in reality assist in
forging chains for our future en
thrallmnent.--N. 0. Bulletin.

T HE SALES of the SINGER last year
Swas the greatest ever attained for
any Sewing Machine in a year, and was
nearly double the sales of its highest
competitor, as may be seen by reference
to the account of sales for 1873, from
sworn returns made to the owners of the

in favor of the SINGER, is the ennrmous

Platform of the White People's
Party.
We, the white people of Louisiana, eln
bracing the Democratic Party, the Con
servative Party, the White Main's Party,
the Liberal Party, the RKftbrn Party and
all others opposed to the Kellogg usur
pation do solemnly resolve and declare ;
1. That the government now existnllg
it Louisiana originated in, and has beenI
naintained by force and fraud, in oppo
sition to the will of a large majority of
the voters of the State; in oppositionl to
the principles of the Constitution of the
United States and in violation of every
principle of justice and liberty.
2 That the dominant taction of the
Radical party in this State thas, by false
andul fraudulent representations, int:iuned
the lpassios and prejudices of the ne
groes, as a race, against the whites, antd
has thereby madei it necessary fir the
white people to unite and act together inl
self-defense and the preservation of white
civilization.
3. That the rights of all men under the
Constitution aind laws of the land must
be respected and preserved inviolate, .i
reepective of race, color or previous con
dition, but we deny that Congress can
Constitutionally enact laws to force the
two races into social union or equality.
4. That the white people of Louisiana
have Ino desire to deprive the colored
pieoiple of any rights to which they are en
titled, but we are convinced that the re
forms imnperatively demlalided, can be
effected only by electing to otlfce white
men of known capacity and integrity,
and we believe that large nuliubers of
colored citizens will vote with as to se,
cure a government which nust be bene
ficial alike to both races.
5. That we disclaim earnestly any in,
tention of carrying, or atteminpting to car-,
ry, the approaching election by violence,
and that charges to this etfect emanating
from our Radi'al enemies, are without
foundation and are falsely mnade for tile
purpose ofohtaining the aid of the mil
itary force of the United States in order
to over-awe the people, perpetuate the
existing usurpation and subvert the true
principles of the government.
G. That W P. Kellogg in a mere usurp
er and we denounce hiil as such, that his
government is arbitrary, unjust and op
pressive ; and that it can maintain it
self only through Federal interference.
7. That the election and registration
laws under which this election is being
conducted were intended to perpetuate
the usurpation by depriving the people
and especially our natrralized citizens of
an opportunity to register and vote, but
we announce, distinctly, that it is the
determination of the people to have a
fair and free election anil to see that the
result is not changed by fraud or violence.
8. That we extend to all our race in
every clime the right hand of fellowship
and a cordial invitation to come and set
tle among us, and unite their destinies
with ours.
9. That while we are in favor of meet
ing punctually the payment of the legit
imate debt of Louisiana, we are inuno
vably opposed to the recognitions issued
in the alune of the State, and we pledge
ourselves to make a searching investiga
tion in the matter.
We advise our people to vote against
theamendments to the Constitution pro
posed by the usurping Legislature and
pledge ourselves on the restoration of the
government to honest hands, to provide
for the payment of all honest indebted
ness of the State.
TIEa )UTY OF SuPERVISORS.-The

The Saturday Evening Post.
Thie Oldest and Best Story Paper P'ub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more thaq half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been tihe
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblem,uished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, fmam its
tnever containinig, anytling that would
olhiend the feelings of any one, either in a
a religiolub or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
objection from the lmost fastidious.
T'he circulation of the Saturday Even .
ing Post, through not quite so large
pe'rhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of soume of thema, 1luctu
ating, and too often short-lived, hutÂ°
SURE, SOLID AND SU1STAN'TIAL,
based lupon the int'rinsic merit of the pa- I
per itself and neot dependent on any ox
traneous inlluences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the piast, it is our I
intention to maeke it still better in tilhe
fiuture, and with this oblject iii view we
will effiect a marked improlvemnent in eve
ry departmneut of th paper, and will
call to our assistance Writers of admitted I
ability andi known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions.
and adding many judicious and pleas- 1
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the populr taste, by in
creasing ilnustry and eanprise, and by, .
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with 'leach and every issue, and
contionue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of TiE
OLDEST ANID THE BEST of Family Story
