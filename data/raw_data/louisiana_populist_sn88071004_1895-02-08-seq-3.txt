Committee.
FINNFTELD, Jan. 30, 1895.
The committee was called to or
der at 7:30 p. m., by Chairman F.
M. McCain, with Berrian Bailey,
Secretary.
Roll call showed 6 wards repre
setnted, and a quorum. Several
leadiing Populists from each ward
were present, in addition to the
mrembers, and took part in thQ dis
cu~sions.
The chairman explained the ob
jects of the meeting to be the elve
tion of members of a Judical DIis.
trict Executive Comnrittee and any
other business pertaining to party
organization.
On motion, the body went into
the election of 3 members of the
Judicial District Executive Coin
i mittee, which resulted as follows :
G. C. Purvis, B. W. Bailey and F.
T. Walker.
On motion the chairman was an
thorized to appoint a committee on
resolutions, when lihe appointed the
following: II. C. Mixonl, F. 1'.
Walker and P. F. Smith.
W hile thie c'm, llittee loi l"s lIi
tions were preparing their report
the Executive Committee went in.
to the election of a Senatorial Ex
ecutive Committee, which resulted
in the selection of B. E. Woods, J.
U. Crawf.ird and Dr. A. P. Col
lins.
The cniunmittee on resolutions
then reported tihe following:
We your conmmittee on resolu
tions Lbeg leave to submit the fol
loxiug for your earnest considera
tion:
Whereas, since the toundation of
our republic it has ever been one
point in statesmanship to remove
as far as possible the Judiciary
from partisan politics, in order, if
possible, to administer justice in
strict accordance and harmony with
the natural rights that the human
family should enjoy under a civili
zed form of government, and
Whereas, it is a lamentable fact
that in past years, even the Su
preme Court, the highest tribunali
in the land, when rendering decis
ions affecting the future welfare of
either or both of the dominant po
litical parties, that these honored
and important factors of our gov
ernmeut have divided upon such
questions strictly on party lines,
regardless of justice, and
Whereas, in the interest of good
government and honest and lompar
tial administration of justice, your
committee believes it unwise, if we
should take cognizance of the past,
to confine the judiciary to partisan
lines, therefore
Resolved, that we recommend
your Judicial Executive Commit
tee to call no judicial nominating
convention, and take no steps to
indorse or nominate strictly party
candidates for judicial positions.
Respectfully,
F. T. W AZIE, Chai'mn.

It makes no difference what you want, Staple or Fancy goods, they all go at what they COST, for
we mustldispose of the stock. Bince we commenced selling our stock at cost, our store has been
been crowded from morning until night, which proves very conclusively, that the purclhasing pub-I
lie appreciate the opportunity to buy goods, and desirable goods at cost, and have taken advantage
of the ch:ance to save money. All that is necessary is to come and examine our stock and get our
prices, and you will see what a saving it is to buy goods at cost. In this issue of the POPvLIST we1
mention the cost ot a few articles, merely to show you what it means to buy goods at cost.
We would prefer to sell our entire stock to one party, and lease the storehouse to them, therefore,
it there are any one desiring to engage in a good and profitable business, we would be pleased for,
them to call and see us. We will sell the stock at a considerable reduction. Our only reason for
retiring from business is that we are going to a large city.
