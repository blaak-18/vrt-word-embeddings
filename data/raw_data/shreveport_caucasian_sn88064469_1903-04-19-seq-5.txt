"DER WALD'S" COMPOSER.
Miss Elhel Smyth and Her Remark
able Achievement.
An interesting event of ti:e musical
season of 1903 has been the perform
ance for the first time in America of
Miss Ethel M. Smyth's opera. ")er
Wald" ("The Forest"). Thus it cannot
be longer said that no woman has ever
composed a successful opera. '.:,re
over, a distinguished musical critic said
of it after its first night in New ,York,
"To the opera's credit, it can be said
that discussion of it may proceed upon
the broad plane of contemporary mu
sic without reference to sex or nation
ality."
This is very good, considering it was
written by a man concerning a wom
an's musical composition, which gener
ally receives more sneers than pats on
the back from masculine critics. In
deed, even in this case the critic, like
a man, involuntarily claims what is
best in the opera-that is, the style of

composition and its basic philosophica
and intellectual ideas-as "masculine t'
an astonishing degree." From the in
tellectual standpoint praiseworthy
therefore they must be "'masculine!'
which leads one to observe once more
that there is nothing small about the
male mind when it comes to claiming
things.
Miss Smyth is English born and rear
ed, the daughter of a British artillery
general. The military social set intc
which she was born is one of the mosi
conventional among all mankind in itb
notion of what is proper for a well
-born and bred "young female." Sc
Ethel Smyth found it when, aspiring
and longing, feeling within her a grow
ing impulse of power which she must
express or die, she at the age of twelve
announced to her family that she was
going to Leipsic to study music..
The little girl's family checked her,
meddled with her natural longingh and
sought to kill them. Her work, ad
mirable as it is, shows traces of
Grundyish interference.- It is color!ess
in the passages where it should be
warm and passionate, the critics say.
as though the young woman could not
blurst her stays and be entirely natural
and full in her expression of what
Mrs. General Grundy disapproved.
Still the young lady's opera is so strong
and musical- in other ways that the
critics may forgive this defect. She
will proambly learn better in time.
Ethel. Salyth was persistent She
kept declaring over and over again
that she Intended to study music and
clmpose music as well. It required
seven years to overcome the family.
Then the girl went her way to Leipsic
rejoicing. The seven years. however.
were not wholly lost, for she developed
a ine, graceful physique through exer
Cise in doors and out. -She is fond of
gofl, horseback riding and dancing.
The Smyth familb gave her permis
iton to- remain in Leipsic a year. By
that time they believed the nonsense
would be taken out of her and' she
wpuld be willing to return home and
take the round of life suitable to any
well regulated army girl. But she did
not return at the. end of a year. She
remained in Leipsic. on the contrary,.
four years, studying with enthusiasm.
She began musieal composition while
there. Leading performers in the city
of music gave at different times a
string quartet and a violin sonata by
her. After- Leipsie the girl still re
fused to drop into nonentity, but con
tinued working in Dresden. Munich
and Fl'orence for several seasons. -Then
she studied in Rome, whither shesstill

SN every country neighborhood. in
.r any town small or large. wome n
0 who are in earnest and set their
r heads to it may originate ways of
bringing in money while at the same
i time they attend to their daily house
hold duties. At a meeting of the Min
d nesota Dairymen's association severai
n ladies reported their success in rew
I keeping. One woman, Mrs. IIolhes,
i- was fond of cows and had money to
buy one. That was some years ago.
s Mrs. Holmes now has a farm of 240t
acres in small grains and pasture. The
grain lands gave a phenomenal yield
a to the acre, the men farmers said when
i- they heard the average was nearly fif
e ty bushels. Mrs. Holmes has now
twenty-six cows, which gave her nearly
f $1,500 worth of butter last year. For
a farmer that is not a bad income.
Mrs. Holmes wisely uses all the prod
uct of her latl to feed her stock on.
A Maine woman, Mrs. Florence Cum
mings, who likewise phays the piano,
dev.tes her farm to poultry, hay and
dairying. She does all her own house
work and sells twenty pounds of butter
a week. Country women around Bos
ton have taken up market gardening
with enthusiasm, and several of them
are in receipt of incomes from this
source that many professional men and
women might envy. In New England
it is becoming common to employ Ital
ian women to do the work in market
gardening, and they make excellent
help. They do not get drunk or quar
rel. In the west and southwest, of
course, however, it is left for women
to conduct farms on a grand scale. In
California Mrs. Buckingham of Vaca
ville long since showed what woman
can do in the agricultural fie!d; so did
the ingenious woman who raised pam
pas plumes and created a demand for
them. In the Panhandle of Texas Mrs.
Pauline Whitman owns and operates a
ranch of 200,000 acres, on which she
raises 15,000 cattle a year.
In another field of home industry
may be mentioned Mrs. Kidd, the lady
who began making delicious pickles ac
cording to a recipe that had been in her
family for generations. Year after
year she took premiums for her wares
at southern state fairs before she ever
thought of pickle making as a remu
nerative industry. Finally it occurred
to her that, since her pickles were so
very good, she might get some spend
ing money by selling them. She of
fered some of them at a famous south
ern hotel. At once they met with fa
vor. Then another and another hotel
manager wanted them till a trade be
gan that was widened out to include
railway dining cars and great ocean
steamer lines. Like Mrs. Macready of
Buffalo, Mrs. Kidd first made her deli
cacie in her bwn kitchen. As was the
case with Mrs. Macready's husband
also, ere long Mrs. Kidd's husband had
to give up his own work and ,help his
wife with the industry she had found
ed. A large factory has been built in
the rear of the old southern home in
which Mrs. Kidd lived, and scores of
helpers are now employed regularly.
Among the most interesting and lu
crative home industries for women is
,,.
one which became popular so suddenly
•that it amounts to a fd. The fad will
die a natural death by and by, but
while it lasts hundreds of quiet domes
tic women are getting good money out
of the homemade rug business. There
are braided and sewed rugs, crocheted
rags, knitted ones and those woven by
hand in a way similar to that whereby
the most expensive Persian and orien
tal rugs are manufactured. All over
the Union women are catering to the
popular fad, learning from aged moth
era and grandmothers how these made
rugs half -a century ago, except that
the grandmothers made the rugs for
sturdy farm boots to tread upon, and
that right beavila while the grand

TREATMENT OF WALLS.
A Hint For the Woman Who Wishes
an Artistic Effeet.
If the walls are tastefully decorated,
a room is more than half furnished.
Wall papers are now produced in such
endless variety that something artistic
may easily be found for a very small
amount.
Perhaps one of the most popular
methods of treating a wall consists in
papering it in two colors, or, rather,
LIEM
BLUR AND WHITE.
two shades of the same color, the up
per section being lighter than the low
er, as a rule.
The dividing line is concealed by a
shelf which .uns around the room and
which holds china, books, bric-a-brac.
etc.
The illustration shows just such a
treatment of a wall. The color scheme
is in two shades of blue. harmonizing
prettily with the vwhite woodwork and
the blue and white china.

EXTRAVAGANCE OF WOMEN
They Waste Many Little Thinga
Which Count Up.
Are women extravagant?
An English paper discusses this at
great length in its usually ponderous
fashion.
I say they are and they are not.
In household and many important
matters the majority of women are not
extravagant; for, as a rule, they are
not well off ac
cording to their
position in life,
their allowances
are small and
they have many
expenditures.
Then, too,
they have been.

extent, for to

- But there are
many small things in which woman is
most extravagant.
She will wear her best tailor made
out in the rain, thereby impairing its
freshness forever and a day, and this
simply to make an impression on some
woman she doesn't really care two cents
about. She will likewise hold up her
umbrella in a rainstorm using a hand
incased in a white glove. She might
At leapt remove the glove, for one spot
of water absolutely ruins it.
She will buy a dosen veils at one
time, wear each once or twice and then
throw it in a little heap in the bottom
of a drawer. If the veil had been roll
ed lengthwise, it would have lasted
four times as. long, and why use so
many at once?
Then she will put rough bindings on
the bottom of her skirts and ruin her
expensive boots, or, worse still, put on
no binding at all, which ruins the skirt.
Yes, and she will waste money for
neck ribbons which are mussy and
don't look half as well or last as long
as a regular collar and buy fancy belts
and novelties, which go out almost as
soon as they are "in" and which eat
up her money so wonderfully that she
wonders why she has none left to pur

W HAT is probably the most
hopeful sign of that strange,
complicated, conglomerated
life on New York city's fa
mous east side is the activity of the
girls' clubs there. For woman, young
or old, to go outside of her home, ex
cept to church or the grocery, is some
thing comparatively new in east side
annals. The strong, ambitious factory
girls there are changing these condi
tions. More than a dozen years ago
Miss Grace Dodge began establishing
social and educational clubs among
them. It gave them what they needed
-a hint of better things and how to do.
From that initiative they swept on
ward and started for themselves so
cial clubs, likewise associations for in
struction not only in school branches,
but in the industries. In that erst
while benighted New York east side
these independent, enthusiastic work
ing girls have now some 600 clubs.
There are stenographers' associations,
and some of the girls belonging to
them can take dictation and typewrite
in five languages. There is a society
of artificial flower workers that sub
scribed money and sent one of their
number to Paris to learn how the
French make those exquisite silk, cot
ton and velvet blossoms and leaves
which cannot be distinguished from
the natural except at very close sight.
These young women are New York's
best hope in the midst of political dis
honesty and political ignorance. The
girls have classes in bookbindery,
classes for learning telegraphy and
stenography and those for nature
study, besides many others. The na
ture study class goes into the parks dur
ing the scant leisure hours these brave
workers can call their own and makes
observations under the eye of a teach
er. The girls have organized likewise
a department connected with the Soi
ety For the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which, it is safe to say, is
more than any young men's organiza
tion has done there. Others of the
young women learn civics and the sci
ence of government.

A newspaper recently devoted a long
article to the story of a rich young wo
man who fell in love with a magnetic
but ignorant young man and thereupon
employed some of her dollars in educat
ing him so that he might make a com.
mendable appearance in her social cir
cle preparatory to being married to her.
Well, I don't see why not. For gener
ations rich men have been sending poor
but pretty girls to school and marrying
them when the education was supposed
to be finished, and nothing has been
thought of it. Why should not the rule
work both ways?
