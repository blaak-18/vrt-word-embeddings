The suggestion of our neighbor, the Ad
vertiser, for the calling of an immigration
convention of the parishes of Vermilion,
Iberia, Acadia and Lafayette, to be held in
this town encompasses a splendid idea, and
one to which The Gazette gives its warmest
concurrence, and would further suggest that
the parishes of St. Martin and St. Landry
be added. We thiuk an organization formed
of representative men from each of these
parishes could do a world of good.

most enjoyable time.
The criminal docket at this session of
court is a large one, and among the number
of cases some are very serious, involving
death should unqualified verdicts of guilty
be returned. The trial of these cases must
necessarily consume much time, but the
judge, district attorney, and court officials
seem to be willing to give their best efforts
to expedite court affairs. Last Wednesday
court opened at 1o o'clock, and continued
in session, with only two short recesses, un
til so o'clock that night, and took an ad
journment to 8:30 the next morning, thus
demonstraiing that our public officials are
alive to the public interests, and for which
they deserve much praise.
A Mistrial.
The case of the State of Louisiana versus
G. Derouen, for violation of the Sunday law
was called up 'Tuesday and placed on trial.
The best part of the day was devoted to the
taking of evidence and arguments of the
lawyers. The case was submitted to the
jury early in the evening, and they retired
for deliberation. At eight o'clock word was
sent to the judge that the jury was unable
to agree; the judge ordered the jury locked
up for the night. At to o'clock next morn
ing court was opened and the jury called in;
still unable to agree the jury was discharged
and mistrial entered. The jury stood eight
fy" acquittal and four for conviction.
"Borderland."
The local papers of New Iberia speak in
high praise of the drama and acting of
"'Borderland" recently presented twice by
the amateurs of the town.
The Gazette learns from its esteemed lo
cal contemporary that it is the intention of
some ladies and gentlemen to put this play
in rehearsal, with a view of soon presenting
it to the public. We understand that it is
purposed to give the proceeds 'to the High
School fund.
The Gazette confidently predicts that
those taking part in its presentation will
.score a hit, artistically and financially, be
cause, we are assured, the materiaL is at
hand to insure the former, and the latter will
follow. Sub resa, (we take it), we heard
the names of a few who will take part, and
those, we are informed, have the ability and
histrionic knowledge requisite to make their
respective parts an artistic success. As soon
as the full cast is decided upon-possibly it
is settled now-we shall endeavor to secure
it and present same to our readers.
A Lovely Spot.
Situated on the beautiful Bayou Vermil
ion, one mile from the town of Lafayette,
and owned by Major Sosthene Mouton, is
the lovely and picturesque Beausejour park.
Nature has, indeed, been lavish in her
gifts to the Parish of Lafayette, and, to no
spot has she been more liberal in bestowing
her favors than on this beautiful place.
There stands the large and umbrageous
oaks, robed in silvery moss drapery,defying,
Ajax-like, the destructive hand of Time;
the gorgeous verdure and flora of exquisite
tints; and, the bubbling springs, the water
of which is as clear as crystal,-the living
evidence of Nature's masterful performance.
To this, and which enhances very much the
natural beauty of the place, is a large plat
form, architecturally tasty, and circular in
form, for dancing; a rostrum, from which
many an address has been delivered ; a mer
ry-go-round and see-saw, for the children;
comfortable benches, for the weary; arbors,
with growing trellis, sentimentally denomi
inated lover's retreat; the ever-flowing
spring, whose limpid, cool and invigorating
water invite the thirsty ; the well-arranged,
neat bath-rooms, are some of the accessories
that go towards making the whole the lovely
place that it is. The major is contemplating
some additional improvements, and on this
line has already set out a number of rose
bushes.
That the beauty and conveniences are
appreciated is attested by the large number
of pleasure seekers who throng the grounds,
and it is recognized to-day as fpar exce/lance
the ideal place for a recreative outing.
The water of the spring has been par
tially analyzed and show:
The chlorides of calcium, magnesium,
sodium, and potassium.
Dicarbonates of potasssum and nmgne
slum.
Carbonates of calcium, magnesium and
sodium.
Iron and Phosphoric acid.
Total solids mo.84666 grains to gallon.
Organic matter 2.og98 grains to gallon.
And the report adds : A very good water
for ordinary purposes, and may be of value
medicinally owing to the amount bf mag
Snesium carbonate and dicarbonate present.
It has passed into a truism that one who
employs liberally this water for drinking and
lavatory purposes, can dispense with the
services of a doctor, for he is not likely to
suffer with the ordinary ailments of life,
thus proving that this water possesses much
I medicinal virtue.
The major is in love with his place, and
he has every reason to ibe. ltis greatest dle
sire is to embellish it, and solely for this
Spu'"rlwse he will make a moderate charge for
I:'thing privileges, and the use of the park.
To those who wish to enjoy a quiet patO3
ral life, during the heated term, or those
suffering from distressing stomach or kidney
troubles, this place, and waters-proved
efficacious in these affections-offers special
advantages.
Board in the town can be obtained at very
reasonable rates, and the distance to the
springs is a pleasant walk, the greater part
of the way being through an alley of oak
trees.
The place is well worth visiting.
Jim Crow Car Law.
Judge Theard, of the civil district court in
New Orleans, decided Wednesday the case
of Isaac A. Broussard vs. the Louisville,
New Orleans and Railroad company. The
suit was originally for $Io0,0o damages for
having been ejected from one of the defend
ant's trains, but by remittitur the demands
was afterwards re-.uced to $2ooo. The
plaintiff, who is the sheriff of the parish of
Lafayette, claimed that in June, 1891, he
purchased two first-class tickets for pa.sage
from New Orleans to Ethel, for the purpose
transporting a negro named Mouton to the
insane asylum at Jackson under an order of
court. The plaintiff chained his colored
- e iulhe Sffling dlevisi.n of the coach
stigned-to negroes, and plaintiff, bein un
well, seated himself in the non-smt!:ing div.
ision of the same coach. The conductor re'S
quested him to go into the smoking car, and
ordered in the alternative that he go into the
coach set apart for white passengers only:,
This plaintiff refused to do, and demandec
the right to go into the white coach and to
carry his colored prisoner with him, whichf
request was declined by the conductor on'
the ground that it made no difelrence
whether he sat in the negro coach with the'
negro, or the negro sat in the white coach
with him, but the conductor again informed
him that the smoking car was coummon place
of resort provided for both races, and that
if he so desired he could sit in the smoking
car with his prisoner.
Plaintiff insisted upon his right as sheriff
not to be separated from his prisoner, where
upon the conductor informed himn that the
law made no exception in such a case and
that the he must either obey the law or get
off the train. Plaintiff at first elected to
leave the train voluntarily, but upon reflec
tion told the conductor to eject him at his
peril. The train by that time had reached
the Ilinois Central junction within the city
limits, and, as usual. had come to a stop,
when the conductor, without violence or
undue force, ejected plaintiff and his pri
soner from the train. The next day, at the
personal request of the attorney general andl
the local counsel of the company, plaintiff
was permitted, as a favor to ride in the negro
coach with his charge.
Judge Theard \Vednesday held that under
actNo. 1it of 18go railroad companies in
the State are compelled upon a penalty
there tn imposed to provide equal and se
parate accommodation for white and colored
passengers, whom they contract to carry, and
that no person can be permitted to occupy
seats in coaches other than the ones assigned
to them on account of their race, and if a
person refuse to accede to such rule the
railroad official can refuse to carry him. The
law is plain, and no exception is made in
favor of a sheriff or officer of the law in
charges of a prisoner. Any argument or
inconvenience resulting must be addressed
to the Legislature. There being other
means of transporation than that by rail,
plaintiff cannot claim that the enforcement
of the law as to him would amount to a de
feat of justice. In the absence of a special
contract made at the time the tickets were
purchased that he would not he separated
from his charge, he has no cause of com
plaint against the company. Judgement ii,
therefore, given for defendant.

Mr. Fauu!tliader.
I desire to call the atten:ion of whoever it
was that publlished that very impertin:ent
and uncalled for article in the Lafayette Ad.
Svertiser of April 26, S393. as to mle having
dug certain ditches abott tly property, and
thitt said ditchc.; are IS inches ttand 2 feet,
which is not so,, they are only 12 intches deep.
Antd I do think that this party has assmuned
too tnitch power entirely, to co.te out ill pub
lic print and centdemn mte for digging the
proper ditches f.,r an interest best known to
myself. And pray tell nme why make a tar
get of Ule, whent your shots are all meant for
our council and city fathers. And, again,
why do you single Inme out front all other
property holders in this vast conttuntlity for
ha:ving such ditclthes when others a equally
as guilty. I desire to ask this party if lie
has ever been over in the old town ; if not,
he had better take a trip and see what he
can there find; and not try and mcake hitm
self, or the paper that would publish such
an article, so very conspicuous and fault
findlitng with a quiet and peaceable citizen.
I have been living in this conmunuity for
the past eight years, and I desire to call
your atte'ntion to this fact : that in all
these past years I have never seen our town
in such perfect order and so much
improved as it stands to-day, and we
canll only thank our council and city fathers
for it and not you or your fault-finding. Our
present council is a god one, and I earnestly
I pray that Monday next will bring its another
of the same class, and I assure you that the
property-hollers will have no cause to cotn
plain. And further, Mr. Faultfinder, I de
sire to well infirnt you that I have never alt
plied to the coutncil o,r parish oflicers for a
license to olbstruct the banquette about tmy
porperty as no mllan of sense would mllake
such a rermr.k. You certainly could not
have been here very long, "r- y. u woulrl
have known better than to say nit, h to a civi
