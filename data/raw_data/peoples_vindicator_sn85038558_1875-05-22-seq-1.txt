TESTr~IONY OF TilE SADDLE-COLORED
SENATOR BEFORE TIIE CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE.
[CONTINUED.]
Q. In regard to nominating Dis
trict Judge and District Attorney was
it not the fact that the Republicans
resolved not to nominate a District
Judge and District Attorney because
the Governor had not issued any
proclamation for said election ahfd
secondly because Judge Myers' friends
contended that there could be no
election as his term of office had not
expired?
A. That point was raised by the t
Republicans.
Q. Did not the Convention reach
that conclusion ?
A. The question was not raised in
the Convention. The question did
not come up in the Convention.
Q. I understood you to say that it
did come up and that the people were
intimidated ?
A. That body in the Firemen's
P Hall, they said, was there for that t
purpose.
Q. Could not that report have been
circulated by Judge Myers and his
friends t
A. No.
Q. Was not he and his friends very
n much interested I
A. No.
Q. Had he not always assumed the
position that there could be no elee. t
tieon I
Not to my knowledge.
Q. Don't you know that he raised ,
the' question before the Returning a
Board and that the Assistant Attor
ney General gave his opinion that
there was no election under the law I
A. Yes, I know that, that is, since
the election.
Q. You have spoken about these E
armed organizations that you were t
run away from. Did you ever see c
any armed organization of people in I
thatpiarlsh after you or any body,
else ?
A. Now, I don't know, I saw them 1
come to town to force Dr. Boullt and
others to resign.
Q. Did you ever see them on any
other occasion than that about the
15th day of September or after.
A. It was before the 14th. of Sep.
tember.
Q, That was the rensult of the tax
pavers' meeting. Did you, ever see
any armed organization t
A. I' have seen them continually
come in town, if not in large squads,
in small numbers, armed with six
shooters and a great many times with
shot guns.
Q. Is there armed organization in
that parish now f
A. I believe honestly tihat the
White League organization in that
parish is military in its character. I
was there during the twar, and I no
ticed the workings of things and I
never saw such active movements in
any organization. Why, on the 14th
of September, when this trouble took
place down here, it was soon tele
graphed to Shreveport, and on the
evening of the15th that news was in
SNatelhtches, and we could not have
a got tlie news by mail shorter than
r four days ; and the next morning, on
the 16th at about 10 o'clock, the news
came or the intelligence about Gen.
.Grant's order which changed up
things; yet the intimidation was
I above measure.
e Q. To the extent of about how.
many votes did this intimidation af
fect the election of 1874. I
A. I believe there wereait least 12i0
Republicans voters intimidated who i
failed to vote at that election.,
Q. Twelvehundred ? .
A. Yes, in 3874. I think there was
fully 1200. I man to say of those who
Sdid not register, who lived there and
] did notregister by reason of; intimi
dation and those who did register and
afterwards failed to vote,
Q. Do you know what the popula
, tion of your parish is ?
A. I could dot give you this unleBs
I refer to the map,.
Q . I will giveir' to yaou. The full
eeninas of 1870 was 1800, after tlhat,
the first ward, thirteen and one-half
of'the ward there were takes off to
make another pariah. That threw
out thirtftwo hundi~e of the piopula
tion accordig ti the census. Now,
I id, accoaring to the population
ad the number of registered votersm,
that the whites registered one.to 1
every four and a half and' the blacks
registered one to every' four. Now,
if you add twelve hundred to the
black vote it will make one vote, to
every two and a half of blacks.'Po Do
you think the proportion is so ;reat
nr that' parish that you have ,one
voter to every two and a hal off
blacks ?
A. I don't know.
SQ. Tben you most have been wrong
about the twelve hinmdred f
'I believe, to bring up those that did 1
Snot register; and those.that did ret -
ite- sad 41d not-vote; I think lt will
,ine up to10,
Q .How odany dters' in one hun
dredo efthe populatioa woueld there i
beti.
. :lgdess ahbout9ae tourth'of the
numnber would be votes.
Q.. T youP aertdiRy iust be
mlstaken atout the 200
SIa our ill give metieI think I can
6je sts Si lf ter.
I'of
our parisb, beaue as agg
coaut has boen eld 'there, and peo
pie have come on there and entered
lands as homestead-we have public
i lands there ,
Q. You think then that if one
out of every four of the black reg
istered, that that would be fair ?
A. I could not say.
Q. What would you think would
be a fair proportion t
A. I think, if you would give me
time, I could give you figures.
Q. The population of six thousand
and nine whites and nine thousand
and forty-three blacks. Now, the
registration shows two thousand two
hundred and eighty three blacks, and
thirteen hundred and eighty two
whites t
A. I cannot give you that.
Q. Does every voter have to apply
for registration every year?
A. It has not always been the case
that we had to register from year to 4
year; only in case of a new legisla
tive act; such as when the parish of
Red River was formed.
Q. Who appointed the Commis
sioners of election? You conm
plained about names being mnisapellt ?
A. The Police Jury appointed them.
Q. How was the Police Jury com
Sposed ?
A. Of Democrats and Republicans.
One of the Republicans they would
not allow to serve. Wlhere there not
two Republicans and two "Democrats
on the Board ?
A. Yes.
Q." Did they not give an equal di
vision between Republicans anid De
mocrats in appointing commissioners?
A. I believe there was ; but they
were placed about so that things I
went right at some places an at oth
ers not. I don't think they had any I
thing to do with writing the names
on the poll book.
Q. They had to do with deciding I
whether a man had a righl to vote or I
not g v
A. Yes.
Q. Then your party had an equal
number of commissioners !
A. I don't think that those Repub- 1
licans who wanted to give them a
chance to vote would argue the ques
tion very long. I saw some go right I
up and one of the Republican com- 1
imisioners o( election was present. I
sawa colored man go up before me
with his registration papers in his
hands and be was turned off.
Q. Who was the Supervisor of
Registration t Was he appointed by
Kellogg
A. Yes.
Q. Was he a Republican ?
A. Yes, a colored man.
Q. So the machinery of registration
was in the hands of the colored peo
a pie?
A. No, on the contrary, it was in
the hands of the white people t
Q, Hew was that 9
A. There was an Assistant Super
visor who was a Republican and one
Assistant Supervisor who was a Demo
crat, the first assistant.
Q. Is there any provision of law
in regard to clerks.
A. Yes, one is to be a Democrat I
and one a Republican. The Demo
cratic clerk, in many places, took
charge of the machinery and run it.
Q. Then you mean to say that the
Republican did not perform his duty ?
A. I don't think it would have been
very healthy for bhim. I know that
while the registration was going on,
Sho would not interfere, I kpow that
' while bt Clontierville, lie came to me
I and told mne he could do nothing.
I Q. Was there not a large majority
i of colored people registered
SA. There was nine hnndred and
one colored majority registered.
SQ. You spoke about the 'taxes of
that parish, and I ioderstood yeou to
say that a portion of these frraudulent
- warrants were issued by Democrats ?
Ig thbat statement correct f
A. I did'at say anything about the
Sisuaiice of warrants.
Q. Or parish seripFs
A. I did not say any thing about
Sthde issuance of any. I said that it
was the Democratic Police Jury that
I had levied a parish tax of twenty
mille, which was reduced one-half
I by the Republicans.
Q. Whiat Police Jnry was that t
SA. Trhe Simmons' Police Jury.
Q. In what year was that ?
A. In 1873.
Q. How long were they oin power f
I A. I think they were in power all
the year of 1878, under tie compro
mise in May. I think it was some
'time in May that the Compromise
' was effeeted, and Mr. Simmons, Mr.
- Breazeale and Mr. Jennings were re
*turned as deinoeratlo members of the
I Polee Juory.
Q. You spoke of an attack being
Smade on you by some one in Alex
sa drip. Is not that man wsho made
the attack, one who quarrels with
a evey body when he Is in liquor
A. I don't know-I don't know
how he casneto know me.
SQ. You spoke about the Boollt's of
Sthit parish being high-toned, respee '
Stable people, and bhving resided there
alwafys; did enot they remove to the
parish of Winu before the war?
A. They had a pliantation in Wins
*praish, right in the corner of Saline
baou; atechiteches and Wina cor
n~i~there at that bayou.
i Q. Dn't you know the fact that
the Boulltk' were obliged to leave
- Winnparish on a~eoent of the burn
s ing of the CourhosM,:snd theim sss
nioatlon'of a prnmib~lhesigwyer, and

being received or not, into the difflir
eat famnilies there, I don't know any
thing about it, but as a gentleman, lihe
has always acted as such.
Q. Have you never heard that he e
was shunned because of his suspect- I
ed connection with a gang of high- I
way-men, who committed robbery in
1869 and 1870:
A. Some of the whites in the city I
of Natchitoches told me that the peo- .
ple of Winn were opposed to Dr.
Boullt, but they themselves volun
teered their services in favor of Dr.
Boullt, and said to the people in Winn I
parish that they could attend to their
own aflairs f
Q. You stated in an answer to a
question of Mr. Frye, that the color- i
ed people were making a good deal of I
money, and buying land. Will you t
state what are the general terms up- t
on which the colored laborers work t
there ?
A. As a general thing they work '
for a part of the crop. I
Q. For how much t
A. One-half, where they furnisha
themselves, and I believe their teems t
and all of the farming implements. o
Q. What will a good hand raise on
an average in cotton? a
A. A good working hand will aver- .
age about five and it half to six bales. v
Q. In a bad or good season ? ii
A. I couldn't say that in a bad sea- P
son he could raise that. 8
Q. Would three bales or three and
a half bales be a fair average, one f
year and another, in and out ? o
A. I think it would. tl
Q. What does that sell for Is a l
hundred dollars a bale a fair price ? P
A. It would bring a hundred dol- d
lars. t
Q. Then the colored laborer's share
would not be a hundred and fifty dol- iU
lars a share, to support themselves? t
How can they buy land ? V
A. The best way to get at that, I -
will give you the'names of parties "
who have bought plantations. it
Q. I wanted you to make a correc- t
tion if you found you were mistaken. I
A. There is my brother working on ni
Simmons' place, right close to town;
lie made nine bales of cotton-but he I
is an extraordinary hand. a
Q. I spoke of an average hand ? a
A. Five and a half or six bales. d
Q. Then in addition to this you say a
that the colored, people were goene- a
rally swindled at the end of the b
year, by the white employee?
A. I don't say say that they all do e
it, but a great many colored men now
work for themselves, they make the
crop and divide with others who are
not able to buy land.
Q. Don't the large majority, say t,
nine tenths, work on shares r
A. I don't know, because every '
year they get more and more out to
themselves. They rent a whole place t
and run it themselves. I know sere 1
lral colored people who do that. They r
have paid as high as ten dollars an
acre rent.
Q. You spoke of driving Judge My
era out. Was not that on account of
his legalizing, by judgment, these
fraudulent debts of the parish
A. I don't believe it; it may have a
been the case, but I have asked those
gentlemen what the objection was
against him. I told them, I notice
that none of your people have taken
an appeal to the Supreme Court from
any of his decisions. I asked Col.
Pierson-I said to him, "Isn't he com
petent," he said, "yes." I asked I
"what is your objedtion then." ie
said, "ie ts snuch a damned trickster
we don't want him." I asked, "Is it
possible that he beat yen all." Ie
said, "Myers ain't a good man, and
if you continue his support1 you kill i
be sorry." His objection was just'
that way.
Q. Did he charge him with corrup
tioun
A. Yes, he clharged'him with cor-,
ruption. in fact they will charge
any body with corruption to get rid
of him.
Yon speak of "curly headed Ilynes";
iq he not in bad ,eputein the pariah ,
A. Yes.
Q. And yeou say the White Leegue
is made up of all the white men in,
the parish 1
A. Yes, I don't believe that any
white man who lives there could live
in the parish had not belong to it.
Q. You say that the White Leagne
is made up of all the white men and
"curly headed Hynes" is at the head
of them ?
A. He was captain of that company a
that scoured Cane river.
Q. He has not the respect of the
people and yet tlhey put him as their
'Captain?
A. He performed that service. I
know white men who said they would
not go into it if they -were to have
such a man as Hynes at thie head of
it.
Q. In regard to murders, who are
the most murders comuntitted by, the
colored or whites ?
A. A good many have been com
mitted and sone that we never could
be able to learn who did it. I will
say, as far as I know, that the larg
est portion have been committed, by
white people.
Q. Have you had any political mnr
dars unp there ?
A. Yea.
Q. Name them ?
A. One man, Alfred Hasel, was
taken out of his ihouse between hiis
wife and daughter and shot down.
Q. Who was he ?
A. A colored man, a leadingIRepub
li ican i the L--- settlement.
Q. When was that.-what year ?
A. I think it was in 1868.
Q. When was the next murder ?
A. There was one again that was
found hangiog en the read going
from Natchitoehes to Many.
SQ. Were both of these attributed
to lities ?

BEST BREED OF lloc;s.-In answer
to an inquiry which is the best breed
of hogs, an Ohio breeder gives; the
following reasons for naming the Po:
land-China as such a breed:
First. They do not get mangy. I
have never had one that was troo
bled this way; and this is something
of so touch importance that it should
riot be overlooked by any farmer who
knows anything of the evil.
Second. This breed is excellent
on account of its early fattening
qualities; and yet for its continued
growth it has no equal. When only
nine or ten months old it will readily
fatten into clear pork, weighing 300
jpounds or more, or they will continue
to grow until twenty months old, and
then weigh, when fattened, from 450
to 525 pounds.
Third. It is the best feeder on elo
ver and blue grass that I know of.
I have witnessed test experiments
which went to show that hogs of this
breed will make more gain and
thrive better on grass alone than titpe
of any othter breed.
Fourth. They are naturally quiet
at all times, unless a contrary spirit
is stirred up by abuse. They fatten
well, eating their till, and then ly
ing down. The sows are good and
prolific breeders, kind in litter, and
good sticklers.
Fifth. I claim that the Poland-Chi
na is the hog for the packer, because
of the proportion of weight behind
the shoulders and the amount of high
priced meat it carries, and a corres
pondingly small amount of offal pre
duced. It has a small head and small
feet.
It is the breed that we can do the..
most with between April and Janua
ry. I claim that pigs should come
when grass in the spring begins to
grow, so that they can be fattened
without having to winter them. Or,
it we deem it good policy to heold
them over, we want them .to keep
on growing during the second suam
mer with the least cost.
I believe the Poland-China is the
hog for the farmer. It is smallU-oned
and long-bodied. It has short ;legs,
and a broad, straight back; It has
deep sides, with square, heavy lams
and shoulders; it has drooping ears
and fino'hair, in color nearly spotted
black.
The Number-of Eggs in-a Hen.-A
curious point of inquiry among noolo.
gists has been, for a long, time, how
many eggs are there in the ovary of
a lien t To determine this, a Getamit
naturalist, a short time since, institu
ted some careful investigations, the
result of which showed the ovary of
a hen to contain about 600 embryo
eggs. He also found that some twen
ty of these are matured the first year,
120 during the second year, 135 du
ring the third, 114 during the fourths,
and during the fifth, sixth, seventh,
and eighth years, the number do;
creases by twenty annually, it con
sequently following that after the
fourth, or at most the fifth year, heos
are no longer profitable as layers,
unless it may be in exceptional in
stances. Some interesting experi
ments were also mad' a short time
since in Germany, co compare the
comparative fecnudit of ducks and
hens-that is, from which of the two -
the larger number of eggs can be
obtained in the same time. For this
purpose three hens and three ducks
were selected, all hatched in Februa
ry and nourished with suitable food.
The following autumnia tihe ducks had
laSd 225 eggs, while the beni laid
none. In the next February the lay
ing season began again with the ducks,
and continued nointerrupted until Au
gust. They showed no inclination to
sit, but became very thin, although
they afterwards fattened up somewhat.
Tie total number of eggs laid by the
liens pmonnted to 257, or 86 eggs
each, and 392, or 131 each for the
ducks. Although the eggs of the
ducks were rather smaller than those
of the hens, yet they proved to be
decidedly superior in nutritive mate
rial, so that the superiority in pr
ductivenesa was decidedly with the
ducks. In regard ,to the means or
