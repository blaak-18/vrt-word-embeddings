THE CAUSE OF DEPRESSION. re
Report of the Massachusetts 1
Committee. ('
ti
Blstoin .March S.-T'he majority )'
of the special commnittee of the ti
house appinted to inquire into 8
the cautlls of thlie prevailing agri 5
cultural del re.sion has prepared a to
relport in which it says: "It is
iliuneiessary for the colmmittee to
cuter into or dwell upion the fact t
that agricultlurte is depressed in
every branch of this most impor- ft
tant industry; that the values of
land andl fartU surroundligns, tun- P
less in exceptionally rare condi
tions, have depreciated steadiiy as
the purc'hasing power of the dol
lar has increased. But while the li
values of plroperty owned Iby the
Americ:an farmers have decreaesd
in thirty years from nearly one
half of the total wealth in 1860li tol
less than one-fourth in 1is90, of I
which I:i per cent is now under
moirt Lae. taxe. have steadily in
creas.ed and debts now require four N
times the labor to be paid off than f,
was then required. The purchas- ti
ing capacity of the dollar to se
cure the farmer's land and his pro
duce has increased four-fold, while o
the power to pay his taxes and h
ehults have remained at a standstill; Ii
In 1 73 wheat sold front $1 55 to
$2 25. a lbushel, according to Spof- `
ford's Almanac. In New York in t
1.,.4, it sold at 3o1 cents." o
I )icussing the causes of the de
pression, it says: "Class legisla- o
tion of the worst character encum- t
hers the statute hooks and has been I
carried on to the detriment of ag- c
riculture and its dependent indus- (
tries for thirty years, culminating t
in the crime of the age, the doe- (
monitization of siloer in 1873. The i:
demonitization of silver was a bold i
stroke in the interests of capital e
that has reduced the value of every
product in the world. Thisi is c
conclusively proven by the fact :
that just as silver has depreciated
in like proportion have all other (
values fallen in the scale. Silver s
bullion to-day has the capacity to I
purchase as much wheat, cotton, 4
pork and corn and land and every
other conmmodity that it ever had; t
therefore the depreciation of the a
white metal simply means the de- 1
preciation of every article under
the sun, with one single exception, I
the gold of Shylock. The tariff I
system is not only unequal, but as E
for the past thirty years adminis- E
tered in this counlry, is most un
just to the consumer and has built I
up trusts, combines and gigantic i
corporations that have not only r
attained immense wealth at the ex- i
pense of the people, but who have I
assumed to control and direct leg- I
islation so as to perpetuate theiri
power and gratify their greed.
The tariff bears with undue weight
upon the producer of agricultural
staples, as it forces him not only
to buy in this market, but sell in
open competition with the world's
lowest prices, Agricultural de
pression is still further augmented I
by the sale of futures on our stock
exchanges, where the grain gam
iders grow rich by farming the
telegraph wires and telling wind;
while the honest and industriousa
toilers on the prairies reap the
whirlwind. Food adulterations
add millions annually to the far
mer's losses and compel him to
meet in competition the theif. To i
these might be added other causes,
but the principal ones to which the
agricultural depression and stagna
lion in trade is due have been
cited.
"The remedy hes in remedial
legislation, and until that is secured
will not come permanently.
"To secure relief we suggest:
"First-That silver shoukl he
relmonetizet ait tlie ratio of 1; to 1. I
"Sec"iondI-'That so Ion" as the .i
present unjust and tnmliual svstemn
of pIrotection contiinues, iagricul
ture should receive its just pro
portlioi, and as this ca:nniot lie se
'eI'edI by a protectivel tariff. that a
boiunty on expolrtied agricultural
staples should I iiliowI simnilar
to that on fish in s1:.1, and for
which ,Jolhn C(. Calhoun votedl.
"Third-That aunlinr in fu
tures should e lpre\vented by law.
"Fourth-That a national ipure
food law should lie enacted.

Democratic Thoughts.
The Sentinel, I)cDmocrat, pub
lished in Washington, D1). ('. says:
"Congress has adjourned. Both
Houses hereafter will lie Republi
c(an. Who should have thought
this after the great victory of s1592 ,
Had Blourke Cochran died after
making his nidnighit speech at the
Chicago national convention, hlie
would be now re.rarded as a saint
for what he said then has been ful
tilled.
"But what a miserable crowd
was that over two-thirds majority
of the last House! IIad there
been but one man o(f courage anti
brains opposing the undemocratic
usurpations of the white house, he
would be now tne leading mllan in
the country. But there was not
one in that Democratic Gomorrha.
"And the Senate! How those
grave soenators obeyed the crack of
the whip from the white house!
Even the Repubclicans were either
cowards or blockheads or else that
Gorman amend(lment to suplly the
treasury with a hundred million
dollars of treasury certificates to
make another syndicate bond sale
impossible, would have been pass
I en. But Mr. Cleveland said no!
As a consequence another syndi
cate bond sale will take place in
t September.
"What a chance there was for
Gorman! lie started well, but
shied before crossing the bridge.
We would have died first before
withdrawing that amendment!
"We first met Mr. Gorman some
thirty years ago at the house of
Stephen A. louglass. Had he
had last week the spirit of the
'Little Giant' the syndicate lpecu
lation and money making would
have ended at once. Still he de
serves credit that he at last under
stood anti pointed out the iniquity.
"For the first time in the histo
try of the country the president was
not at the capitol when Congress
7 adjourned. Bills needing his sig
- niture had to be sent to the white
3 house nearly two miles off. Per
- haps the Czar of Rusesia or the
r Sultan would have done the same.
"Why did he stay away ? That
t query will be answered by another
I one: Why did he next morning
F take French leave ? Why conceal
nthat he wanted to gur fishing and
s hunting? Emperors in Europe do
- not treat their subject. so despica
I bly. They let them know when
k they want to leave town in order to
- save them an unnecessary call.
e Not all of the hundreds of Demo
;crats who did call on the morning
a of the fifth wanted office. But Mr.
e Cleveland evidently does not think
5 much of the democrats.
"What a nice democratic party
)that is! No wonder that in less
D than three years- the people have
got tired of it."
Is it Really a Lie?
SAs we expectel, the report that
the legislature of North Carolina
I adjourned when Fred D)onglas
idiled anndretused to adjourn on
Washiugton's and Lee's blrthdays,
was a big democratic iie. They
e did adjourn on Washiungton's and
lee's bimrtihdays adml did not ad
j.ourn when Douglas died. Now
watch how lllmany papers will cor
rect the mistake! One more nail
ed! Oim to the iext.-Alliance
Farmer, I loiler, La.
Is our conlitemporary, Alliance
Farmler, really correct ini its state
nenlt? If so, the Legislature of
North Carolina has been Imost
flnilly 1imlignedl; and the aut'ior o!
the rejlort, that it did refuse to
honor tihe memory of \Vashisiigton
and Lee and did do, honor to the
negro louglas, is 'a liar so base,
devoidl of honesty an ld Ihono'r, that
lie is but a lit associate for the vile
thlieves, whio iinfest the lowest slmins
of creation.-Progress.
They Aren't Socialists, Ye Knaw.
We, the people of Butt'. dol't
Ibelieve in owning our own water
plant; no, certainly not--that
would be un-Amnlerican, foreign,
socialistic-so we have a privat"
mlonopoly to take care of it, so wed
do. A small house with one hy
drant has to pay only $1.5i a
month; the water is first rate now,
as it is winter, but in summer time
if one leaves a bucket full in the
house the stench reninds one of
its presence, so one puts it outside,
Teams went around with tanks and
I sold drinking water at five cents a
bucket to the people who had to
pay $1.50 a month--but then they
were not socialists! Butte went
t strong relpublican last fall to get
free silver at a ratio of 40 to 1, as
this is a silver-proxlucing state. We
had an explosion here on January
15, killing 0i people-all working
r people; pomwler was stored in city
limits, contrary to law by rich
3 companies, and coroner's jury said
a they were to blame!-isn't that fear
ful punishment to say they were to
° blame? There are quite a few
xpeople here that think if it had
Sbeen a poor man who had stored
the powder against the law and
a sixty rich people had been killed,
it would have been different-but
r then people who think this way are
t socialists or people's party cranks,
' etc. WAcE SLAVE.

e So you think politics has noth

debts or poverty, chi The banker
tells you so. The politician tells
you so. The monopolist tells you
so. The people who live well and
do nothing tell you so. Isn't it
funny that all of these people are
of one mind? All these pei
Spie live off of somebody. Do you
g know who that somebody is? All
these people are anxious about the
e elections. Do you ever ask your
self why? If politics has nothing
