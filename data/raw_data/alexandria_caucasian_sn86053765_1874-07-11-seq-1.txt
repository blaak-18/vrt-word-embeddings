Brownlow on the Civil Rights Bill.
We reproduce two paragraphs
from IJrowiiIow'« letter on the civil
rights bill, addressed to tho Pres
dent of Maryvillo College, by way
of specimens of the whole :
The negro now has the equal pro
tection of the laws. In other words
lie lias equal political rights with
tbe&vhites. Resides this, in all the
Hon)hern States*ho has equal facil
ities for education at the public ex
pense, though he does not pay one
tenth ol im e per cent, on the dol
lar of the tuxcs.which arc collected
to siipport the schools. No in vidi
oils distinctions arc made against
him. Education iu Ibcso Slates is
out of the sphere 't>£! politics. *&lie
negro is amply protected, and the
National Legislature should cease
legislating on the educational ques
tion and creating turmoil and bad
blood wh"ere progress and good
feeling is being secured. For sev
eral years the greater portion of the
time of our legislators las been oc
cupied in legislating for tho negro
race. Amendment after amend
ment to the constitution has been
adopted, and law after law for the
further protection of the negro has
been adopted, until hci&^s now the
political equal ot the white man.
Now that this has been achieved—
the negro business ought to stop.
The country at largo is becoming
disgusted with (Uo efforts now be
ing made to oppress the whites in
tho pussago of a hill which is not
essential to the protection of tho
blacks.
What the people and the States
of the South need is to bo let alone
by Congress, aud givcu a.little op
portunity lor recovering lrom the
desolation and waste of war. The
Southern pcojdeliavc been whipped
iu battle between the sections, aud
exfcept a small class ot fossilized po
liticians aud a lot of weak-minded
young men who part their hair in
the middle they acknowledge and
teel it. Iu uo State iä tlib uegro de
prived of Jull equal protection be
lore tho law; but iu several South
ern Statek, like ^uth Carolina, the
white man bus no rights which the
uegro is bound to respect.

ÏVrfni Tiré Wireveport Time«.
The KeW OrteanA Bulletin haa
seveftit times rf>c#ntfy warned the
people of the eon »try that the ae
groe* were being fomiahed with
arm* fMÄ lfew Ortèn rw. W# «e
not kiTOw that there iaimy difect
testimony to prove fkê Irtith xit
these ns«ertions, itftd Indeed, there
is Httle probability of any such ev
Idenoe leaking ottt; for it it is the
Imi'posfl of tho carpet-bagger« and
scallaWags to resort - to the desper
ate means of arms to maintain their
doomed power, their aim will be to
conduct their operations in secrcy,
and perpetuate a massacre rather
than engage in a fight. It behooves
tho white people therefore to be on
the watch; to notice closely all the
movements ol the negroes and the
white rascals that are leading them.
The political situation gives os a
good basis for suspicion, and the
threatened consequences are ot too
grave a nature to bo lightly thought
of. Tho enrpet baggers and scal
awags see that their long reign ot
rascality and plunder is likely to
terminate, and they are loth to
abandon their prey. They have so
long reveled and rioted upon the
substance of Louisiana, that they
havo come to feel that the property
and the fruits of the industry of our
citi/.ens are theirs by some diaboli
cal i ight, and they nre incensed at
the spectacle of the white people
organizing all over the State to pro *
tect themselves. They havo come
also to count upon the negroes to
support thein in all their schemes
of robbery, and iu their outrages
llllllll tlllKllfl lliMinttllf fllxl 4<> Matl«.«'
upon public decency, and to ralstf
riots and provoke bloodshed when
ver it suited their purposes. Con
sequently they will make a desper
ate ellort to hold on to their power,
and are exerting all their devilish
ingenuity to combine more closely
and compactly the negro elements,
and to fire their hearts with a still
more brutal hatred of the wliites
These things we know they a ,ire do
ing; they are organizing negro clubs
all over the Slate; they are promi
sing the negroes the confiscated
property of tho whites in tho event
of success, and are mnking thein be
lieve that if the-whites get posses
sion of the government, they will
bo derived, if :iot of their personal
liberty, a: least of their political
rights and of the protection of the
laws; and we havo every reason to
believe that tho negro hordes or
ganized iu the country, and inspir
ed to deeds of violence by promises
of plunder, and stimulated to tho
perpetration of out rages by the fear
of wrong to themselves, are being
armed by tho radical Icadcrsin Js r ew
Orleans. Doubtless tho fnuds of
tho Stutc aro' being expended in
the purehirse of improved wcapous
to place iu the hands of tho negroes
to butcher tho whites. •
What scopo the malignity, cow
ardice. aud despotism of the white
radicals of Louisiana may give
their schemes for the canvass, wo
repeat, it is impossible? for. us to
tell with accuracy; hqt all the signs
admonish us to be on our gfnanl.
Tho white people of this State
have uo-desire to engagç in a con-.
"flict with the negroes; their earnest
desire is to cultivate feelings offre
ciprocal kindness with the|n; the
white people have property, corn
megnAl, agricultural and other in
dustrial interests at stake, all of
which mnst be injured by civil war^
ot rioting and bloodshed. Btit—
they cau and will uo louger jiérnkii

bîoody eareàaaée, Thou let the tie

cVtr tlie Angto Saxon and
have met In irms, the resnlt hau
not been a battle bot a butchery—
it has been a* in Bossier in 1S98,.
and nt Coifhx in 1873. VTc desire
tho negroes to nnderstatnl flint,
while wo are resolved to elect only
white men toolHoe, and to establish
a White man's government, our pur^
pose is not to make wnr Wpon'\heir
right«, buftp protect our o^f9. Nay,
to state the enso-more broadly, to
protect the interest of the people of
Louisiana without distinction of
race. But if they will havo blood
the responsibility will be jipoii
their own heads.
Aud now a word to Out pgopto.
Be prepard for any emergency. Be
calm, but bo resolute and utlyidd
ing\ let the negro nuderstaud that
our purpose is not to de| rive him
of his rights; but let lliin know also
that wo are independent ofhiui—
and that we solicit neither his aid
nor his approbation; and, finally—
if a fight is forced upon ns, let us
be sure that the carpet-baggers ami
scallawags do not escape; let us see
that the dogs do not scamper öfl
before the fight, as they did'at Col
