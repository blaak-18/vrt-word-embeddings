THOS. E. WATSON SPEAKS AT
IDYLWILD.
The People’s Party candidate for
the presidency Hon. Thomas E. AVat
son of Georgia fully sustained his
unsurpassed reputation as an orator
and statesman in the speech which
he delivered at Idylwild, last Fri
day, to an audience of more than
five thousand people from the coun
ties of Johnson, Washington, Laurens,
Toombs, Jefferson and Wilkerson.
He was introduced by Hon. A. S.
Bussey, formerly of Wrightsville,
but now of Ashburn.
Mr. Watson was in the pink of
condition, and in the opening of his
speech, as he referred tenderly and
lovingly to the loyal friends who had
followed his fortunes in the early
nineties, those whose faces he recog
nized in the vast throng before him,
and those whose hands had been
folded in eternal rest, there came
back to the Old Guard the memories
of days that are past and gone when
he led them so royally under the
banner "of Populism, and the old
ballle-cry, ‘ ‘ Hurrah for Watson I’ ’
rang out on the summer breeze as of
yore. ’
At the conclusion of his speech,
those who intended to support him
at the polls were asked to signify
their intention, and practically every
man in the vast audience pledged his
unqualified support.
At some date in the near future,
to be announced later, he will speak
at Sandersville. Mr. Watson is one
of the few real orators of the present
age, and our people are to be con
gratulated on this opportunity of
hearing him. —Sandersville Herald.
