cently, smoking a cigar when he
remarked to another negro that "he
was dead in it."

Road Overseer Bonin of the 7th
ward and one to Overseer Landry
in the 8th ward. Among them is
Robert Amy, the pugilist. While
getting the benefit of their work
the pariah will have to feed them
only one half of the time as the
law reduces the sentence that much.

Paid High for his "Booze."
Macelia Garvez, a man claiming
to be an Australian and recently a
resident of Rayne, indulged in an
overdose of "booze" Tuesday night
and while in Mr. Jno. O. Mouton's
saloon drew a knife and expressed
the desire to fight any and every
body in the neighborhood. Officer
Romero was called, and he arrested
Garvez, who would not go to jail
but resisted the officer, and being a
very powerful man, it was only
after a hard struggle that the officer
succeeded in bringing him to the
calaboose. The next morning,
when Garvez appeared before the
mayor, he stated to the court that
although he did not remember
what he done during his spree, he
pleaded guilty to the charge of
drunkenness and disturbing the
peace. He was fined $ro and costs
or twenty days, and to the surprise
of every body he pulled out a roll
of bills, and paid his fine.
The Election.

in this parish for representative

in I~afayetta Thursday inspecting
the local office in charge of J. J.
Davidson, and needsess to say
found everything O. K. at this end.
Mr. Kerkam left the same day for
Opelousas.
Merely Hoping.
In answer to our article last week
headed an "Old Story" the esteemed
Daily Iberian says that it merely
hoped that the rumor of the removal
of the round house to New Iberia
had some foundation and ex
presses the belief that although the
rumor was not correct it should be,
as New Iberia is the place and should
have it. Now, brother, if we had
known that you were only hoping,
we would not have said anything.
It is only natural for the Iberian to
believe that New Iberia sh ould have
been I/e place, but it appears to us
that the railroad company was the
best judge of that fact. The com
pany selected Lafayette because it
is the best place. If New Iberia
had possessed advantages superior
to those which induced the company
to select Lafayette, the round house
and shops would have been built
there and not here, and to-day we
would be doing the "hoping" instead
of our confrere.

Carencro News.
From Our IegularCorrespondent.
-For the week ending April 20o,
medals were awarded the following
young ladies attending St. Ann's
Academy: xst Class, Miss Agnes
Couvillon, "Lessons." and Class,
Miss Estelle Babineaux, "Lessons."
Miss .Emma Babineaux, "Conduct."
-At the annual meeting of the
shareholders of the Carencro Union
Ginnery, Limited, held last week the
following were re-elected as a board
of directors: Messrs V. E. Dupuis,
C. C. Brown, Numa Breaux, Jean
G;uilbeau, Valerie Guilbeau, S. Kil
christ and D. A. Dimitry.
-Your correspbmdent is indebted
to Mr. Adam Sonnicr for a fine
mess of fish received from him some
days ago. Mr. Sonnier is one of
otir live and energetic farmers, who
always manages to find a little time
to indulge in his great love for the
piscatorial art; and is recognized
as an expert in that line.
-Coxey and his crowd were first
laughed at, then rediculed; but the
smile and criticism seem to have
changed to alarm. As long as the
"unemployed" remained scattered
over the country, it was art easy
matter to manage and control them,
but now that they have congregated
together forming an armey of over
ten thousand men it becomes a very
serious matter, and places them
practically beyond control.
-It is rumored that the Carencro
Farmer's Alliance, have organized
an independent organization, which
will hereafter be conducted as a
mutual benefit association. It is
their intention to extablish a tannery
here, and will soon commence the
erection of the necessary buildings
for carrying on the business. A
sufficient amount of stock has been
subscribed for, that will justify them
in commencing operations.
-Through the courtesy and
kindness of Doctors Lessley and
Francez your correspondent took a
ride for several miles east and west
of Carencro a few days ago where
he found the different crops in fine
condition, and the land in excellent
shape. It is rather early to make
any predictions, but the indications
are that we will have a large crop
the coming year. Cane, cotton
and corn are doing splendidly.
-"'Taken as a rule,":' the roads in
the 6th ward are in very good con
dition. This is the opinion ex
pressed by everyone. Mr. Onezime
Breaux,the road overseer,deserves a
great deal of credit for the work
accomplished. Let the gook work
continue.
-Dr. D. T. Courtney was a
visitor in Carencro, last Saturday.
Judging from his appearance, we
would conclude that he has pitched
his tent in a very healthy locality.
-There will be a meeting of the
Attakapas Medical Association held
at New Iberia, Tuesday, May r.
-There was a largely attended
meeting of sugar planters held at the
Alliance Hall last Sunday. A per
manent organization was effected,
and the following gentlemen were
unanimously elected as officers.
Mr. J. M. Jones, President; Mr. V.
E. Dupuis, Vice-President; and Mr.
J. E Mouton, Secretary. Hon. O.
C. Mouton, when called upon, ex
plained the object and purposes of
the association. Suggestions were
made and plans adopted whereby,
the cane farmers, the coming fall,
would be in aposition to handle and
deliver their crop in a more econ
omical and satisfactory manner.
Messrs. J. E. Mouton and J. M.
Jones made a number of valuable
suggestions, that received the hearty
approval of the gentlemen present.
One of the main objects of the
planters, is to endeavor to enlist
capital, or devise means for the
establishment of a sugar mill at
Carencro. The facts and figures
submitted would show the success
of such an enterprise. The gentle
men present represented 764 acres
of cane. The following were elected
as a regular busines committee:
Messrs. V. E. Dupuis, C. C. Brown
and J. M. Jones. All the pla-tters
who were not present, are requested
by the association, to call upon D.
A. Dimitly, and record theirnames,
and the number of acres of cane
that they will dispose of the coming
fall, the object of which will be
fully explained by him. The next
meeting will take place at the
Alliance Hall, on Sunday May 13
at which all farmers interested in
the cultivation of cane, are earnestly
requested to be present.

CHEROKEE.
To Lafayette.
Our recent trip to your Railroad
city was brief, but quite enjoyable.
First we called at the Methodist
parsonage and were delightfully
entertained by the preacher and
family. Next we enjoyed the com
pany and hospitalities of Dr. F. R.
Tolson and family. On the streets
we met friends, not a few, and they
all had a pleasant word for us. We
regret that we had no more time to
spare there in making calls. The
last call we made, outside of your
office was at the free public school,
taught by Prof. R. C. Greig and
Miss Maggie Jamieson. We were
pleased to know, that this school is
enjoying unprecedented prosperity.
WVe found over one hundred pupils
in actual attendance. This speaks
well for the worthy teachers, and
goes to prove that fidelity and per
severance upon their part, have
achieved a good success. Not only
is the attendance good, but instruc
tion is faithfully imparted. We
enjoyed the privilege of interroga
ting, and examining the school, and
found the pupils prompt and correct
in their answers. We were agreeably
surprised to find small children
answering correctly critical ques
tions in geography and grammar.
We sincerely hope that by the open
ing of the next session, ample and
convenient accommodation will be
provided for all who may wish to
attend. There is no better school
that we know of in South Louisiana,
and just think ! Tuition is free.
