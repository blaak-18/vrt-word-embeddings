PAGE TWO
THE HALF-CROPPER’S PLEA.
By Mrs. Sarah V. Smoak.
HEN I read the article by Miss
S. T. Parrish on the Half-
Croppers, I realized that we
had taught and visited in
W
very similar communities.
In Mrs. Kennedy’s comments on
this article, I think she misconstrued
Miss Parrish’s meaning and feelings
toward the half-cropper.
I know these conditions do exist
to a great extent, and have been un
tiring in my efforts to relieve this
condition. I rejoiced when Miss Par
rish had the bravery to publish that
article in which she paints the pic
ture not only of the half-cropper, but
the renter, and day-laborer at the
railroad and sawmill.
I knew she was their friend, and,
because I am their friend, I wish to
add my mite toward relieving the
pitiful condition of the half-cropper.
I have studied these conditions close
ly for twenty years, and have satis
fied myself that the main cause is
abuse and injustice, by the ones to
whom they should look for protection
and aid. And to the good people I
wish to put a few facts, because I
believe if the facts were made public
it would bring relief.
There is a very dark side to life,
and if only the beautiful was pic
. < "ed a great deal of suffering would
go unrelieved. !fhe sad condition of
the poor has caused so many noble,
good men to study to help them, and
by letting the public know have
brought scientists and money to the
rescue.
I agree with Mrs. Kennedy in all
the nice things she says of her pupils,
but I can see the great difference
made in the school laws for town and
country.
I love the country, and know the
present system of country schools is
causing a steady stream of farmers
to flow to town to educate their chil
dren. This has caused so much
alarm that our Secretary of Agricul
ture, James Wilson, has made a spe
cial trip to Massachusetts to locate
the cause.
I wish to give an experience which,
I think, will convince any honest per
son that any effort to help these peo
ple is appreciated and results in big
returns. They are overjoyed to get
kind treatment and a chance to im
prove. They see the heart of a teach
er instinctively.
There was a neighborhood between
two creeks, which belonged to two
counties, and it was near a large
railroad town and country town.
These people were very poor and
wofully ignorant, with the exception
of two families, but positively re
fused to go to either school, which
were one and a half and two and a
half miles away.
A good patron, who had a beauti
ful home, gave the use of a nice
tenant house in his grove for the
school.
The boards of education of both
counties employed me to teach the
school, and seemed much interested
in the upbuilding of the community.
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
The patrons and pupils came the
first day, and I never saw a more
enthusiastic meeting. They were so
proud of their school, and said they
were too poor to send to the railroad
town, one and a half miles aw r ay,
where other children were well
dressed.
There were about a dozen children
from families which were friendless,
living in very secluded places, and
having been soured by mistreatment
rarely left home or visited, looked
on everybody as their enemy; but
w r e finally won them over, and tried
to let some sunshine in their lives.
I never saw a more pitiful lot of
children.
The pupils came regularly, studied
well, and during March and April
made such wonderful progress that
their parents came often to hear
them recite, and took their children
to neighbors and to the railroad town
to let the merchants hear them read
and spell. This caused parents near
the town to send several very back
ward children to me, and I was very
successful with them.
The patrons wanted to bring din
ner, invite their friends and rela
tives, the last day of May, and have
me to examine the children publicly,
which was agreed on by all.
The immense crowd that gathered
listened attentively all day to the
exercises, and those timid, backward
children of six months before faced
that crowd with ease and independ
ence and did so well; the order was
good.
A proposal to build a nice school
building was enthusiastically re
ceived, and plans were maturing
rapidly, when the wealthy, influen
tial citizens of that large railroad
town objected. They said the school
must be closed, it would ruin their
school, because a few backward chil
dren near their town came to our
school. And it was closed, my salary
cut half, although the good people,
judge and even the State School Com-
ISlje.

I would not have you shed a tear
Upon my pulseless clay,
If I should die before you, dear,
And pass henceforth away;
Instead, for memory’s sake, I’d ask,
But this, and this alone:—
If it be not too great a task,
Remember me when gone.
And if in truth you’d glorify
The home I seek above,
And in some manner sweetly try
To tell me of your love, —
When not another soul is near,
And ere for aye we part,
Just kiss a little red rose, dear,
And lay it o’er my heart!
missioner, joined the patrons to get
me paid in full.
The Commissioner said that fifty
cents in the dollar, with salary paid
by other county, made my salary
equal to any teacher in that county,
and they wished to be fair to all.
Which school was most needy and
had best right to public funds? Did
those few backward children that
came from near town injure that
large town school? No, indeed.
It seems that I did my work too
well. Suppose I had taken my ease,
cared nothing for the improvement
of the poor, just satisfied the two
■well-to-do families. I would have got
ten my salary and kept the school as
long as I wished. If I had done
nothing, it would have been all right.
With few exceptions, the disposi
tion exhibited by our county towns
toward the county schools is the same
as this school. Our representatives
come from town and city, and conse-
quently the great difference of laws.
Does a single lawmaker,'who help
ed make the last school law, send his
poorly dressed children to school only
the winter months through woods,
over long, muddy hills, two miles to
school, and have those in primary
grades taught by one of the larger
pupils or a young lady in the neigh
borhood at a salary of $6, $7 or $lO
a month, not sufficient to pay her
board, and where the teacher is
changed almost every term and
sometimes every two months? And
most of the pupils put themselves in
a higher grade every time the teacher
is changed. Under such conditions,
could the finest teacher in the world
give satisfaction? Can pupils un
derstand the seventh grade studies
when they have not mastered the
third and fourth grades?
Our lawmakers have their schools
from a half to a mile apart over
paved streets or a ride in a school
bus, with police protection; the
very finest teacher for primary
grades, no pupil is allowed to rise a
grade without a rigid written exami
nation, and he must make a good
average.
Some of our country people have
found out the cause and wish to
build good graded schools and sup
plement the public fund by a tax, in
order to employ good teachers, but
the towns object. It will ruin the
town school by stopping the well-to
do farmers from coming to town to
educate their children.
So a sharp lookout is kept up, and
any effort to build a good graded
school is spotted and nipped in the
bud, because if one is built others will
follow and the town -will suffer, be
cause a fine school will build up a
business center, stores, gins and a
warehouse, and the big town will lose
a few bales of cotton, some trade, and
a half-dozen pupils.
Now, just suppose it were possible
to get our wealthy, influential citi
zens of our county towns to hold this
dollar far enough from their eyes to
see a short way into the future, and
get their consent to help the half
cropper build a school they would
patronize. Let them put themselves

NO. 8575—A SMART COAT.
A most attractive semi-fitting
coat, cut on simple, graceful lines, is
shown in this model. The right
front laps well over the left and is
held in position by two large buttons,
which may be of the material, al
though jet and metal buttons are ex
ceedingly popular. The two seam
coat sleeves are put in with a little
fulness at the top. Cheviot, broad
cloth, serge and silk would be effec
tive with a simple design in soutache
braiding outlining the neck and
sleeves. The pattern is cut in 6
sizes: 32 to 42 inches, bust measure.
Size 36 requires 3 1-2 yards of
44-inch material.
A pattern of this illustration will
be mailed to any address on receipt
of 10 cents in stamps or silver.
