A queer :,ld jay is the *tr:Uldle-biug
As ontcer as queer eau be:
And his prototype in humau shape
Is just as queer as he:
At pulling strings. or fixing dBeale,
lie has ever. thing nown pat:
Buet run himn irin.st a principle
And he don't k:now "where he's at."
Tle fu:lt,'et, things, outside of a jug
Are the :rrtl, s rare of a straddle-bug.
A stra" gr courenl is the talk-muaebine,
It rnis the whoUle lay long;
The 'vind aal fnrdse go but of its hat
in an everiiatinlK song,
From erely aoru till late at night
It :never malkes a pause;
As ihough the world were a pair of ears,
And itself, a pair of jws.
The greatest hbore that ever was seen
Is the clsckeety-clack ofa talk machine
A rare old enas is the boodle bird;
It neither sings nor talks;
But eat! Why it can eat anything
Front paper 'aw"pd to rocks.'
It isn't ur'wh on trains or gab;
But it's h:Iei' eAs on the rake;
It',s 7te:t ,,i .,L,' !ing t;p the stuff,
A. I i:'a lightning tn the make.
S . .;,:' i;i it, 'tipmn my word

AMul li ttn float All -the land;
WVh!ikl LLe bo~o'le-birdw are as plenty thhe
As the gtai:hs of the gohlen sand.
And eacb. in his owar p.culiar war.
Will gobble, or straddle, 'or talk atn
day.
I had the funmnit kid'of a drep
Not very.Iuntage;
Thr.t your Uncle Samuel last his grip
Ou this highly n,oral show;
And the treed n.nece was rauinag things
(At least so ran the dream,)
With the talk ntachi;e and the straddle
bug
And the boole-bird snprene.
They anumncd sad befouled the ship
of stl.to
And amt it, to bellat a llghtting git.

would hire two brass hands, ad

John Sherman to address, a Demo

in, and he would get nearly every
body in the United States but the
ug Populists.
ag. I would go into the scheme but I
am afraid Jay would trick me. lie
L might go and get up a corner on
brimstone and then I would be in
a (hell of a) fix. I think the only
"' safe way is to keep him on the fire.
It's fun to see him dance. Say it's
ine making me sweat like the Devil to
stay here.
Say, old pards, how long do you
think it will be before old Clcevy
shakes of the mortal coila Ile's
doing me lots of good down there,
but I'm dying to put him ou the
fire. Won't that be a fat frying ?
And won't I make Hell resound
*e with my ha, ha, ha's? Now there's
of old Sherman, 't'll take a hundred
years to get him warmed up, be
oo, sides he's too valuable for me to
,e .loee down there. Now, you fel
lows did awfully well. Just keep
on telling lies and duping the peo
ple and besides the offices down
there I'll give you a tin horn and
•two.*inee) respite when you come
up here. Whoop the boys up and
gI bring all you can along with you.
le Any body that hasn't got sense
enough to vote hasn't got sense
enough to keep out of Hell, and if
iP you fellows keep up your square
it. toed lying we'll get nearly all of
'em. I feel a little sorry for the
Democrats who lied so industrious
ly and got licked so overwhelm
ingly.
a They will lose their ofli es and
n- their salaries, but I won't lose any
g- thing. The Republicans will do as
much lying for me as the Demo
crat, and besides the Democrats
will be willing to tell the same lies
over again in the next campaign.
I aml well satisfied with the way
In things stand now. If we can get

into law I can in a few years, make
my viortga ecover nearly every

land and Sherman are great men,
and if I ponclude to establish a lit

of moving the whole thing up here
