many week« ago wo heard a gen
tleman who purchases largely in
Texas cattle, say ho was offered in
Texas twenty yoke of broken oxen ;
each yoke averaging 1000 pounds;
at $20 per yoke—8400 ; just the
price ot a pair of No 1. mules. As
wo stated, the great disideratum
ill plowing; not only to save ihanu
ul laboi, but to plow thoroughly is
concentration ot power. We
tell no one that two yoke of, oxen
weighing 800 pounds to the ox
would be a much greater eonecii-joil
tratiou of power than a pair of
mules, and ther«y.^rjj intrinsically
worth more in maR.-,jn? a c: ■ >;> even
if they plowed over m, larger space
per day. But two yoke of oxen
would plow within a fraction
twice as much as a pair of mules.—
This is not the only advantage,

They could bo fed on hay, shucks
pea vines and cotton seed, food as
uiticli cheaper than corn and oats,
«s the ox is cheaper than the mule.
But all these things arc well nnder-„
stood and acquiesced in by our cit
izens and the marvel is that they
have never turned them to their
advantage. If one of our citizens
has an hundred or hundred and fif
ty dollars with which to buy plow
teams; lie either buys one good mule
or two very inferior ones and with
no more team than that to a plow,
lio one can farm successfully.—
Whereas if half that money had

Imiid to have turned under three
acres of green manure per day or
ttuhsoil the same quantity to the
•depth of 10 to 18 inches, or have
thrown two acres per day into beds
■ot any desired width. Of course
we contemplate this plowing to lie
«lone with the gang plow or culti

What is the Steam Plow but

adapted to a greater concentration

the faith to believe and shake oil
the fetters of old ideas, there is
nothing to prevent them; even in
their poverty from making the Tex

lie brought into the room a good
sized ear of corn, and upon count
ing, we found it to contain eleven

'We bot Ii agreed that such an ear

then stated that he had counted the
peas ou a single stalk, from tlie

number five hundred. Four pea
stalks would grow on the ground
occuppicd by one stalk of corn
making the yield, in grains, fully
two to one. lie further stated that
he had pastured his hogs on tin 1
peas, and found that they thrived

He had not tried them lor other j
stock, thought they would, no
doubt, make excellent feed for hor

Another neighbor used the green

Ins horses aud mules, of which they
seemed very fond. On examina

four such vines would be cqniva-j

Allowing twelve good stalks of)
corn to one heavy bundle of fodder,'
and four stalüs of peas to one stalk

twelve, corn one ; as grain or meal,
peas two, com one; money value,

whose présence piide and revenge
and brave and bloody honor were
hushed into silence. Wo knew him

taken with a fierce and violent fe

dreadful reality was revealed that

was Mom him we learned our story.

How Georgs Washington was Hu
Ehaei
We do not mean George Wash
ington, the father of his country, bat
one of those innumerable George
Washington's produced by the late
struggle. We have known as many
as hidf a dozen to be produced uj*>n
a single plantation. But our George
Washington was much above most,
of these fathers of their country. We
knew him well. He was truthful and
honest and could read and write.—
Being a minister of the Gospel, he
necessarily became mixed up in poli
tics, as radicalism is a pijrt of the
negro system of theology. George
became a man of great inflnence with
hia people and in 1870 was nominat
ed with another co ored man as can
didates for the Legislature from the
It,
so happened that Senator
sword.iTwitchel had purchased the Star
1Light plantation, on Bed River, in
i the uttermost corner of DeSoto; and
Jas it was twenty five miles from
j Mansfield, the Parish seat, and fifty
: from the Western boundary and cut
(oft from every other portion by Bayou
l'ierre and in Winter by an impassa
|>]o swamp, it was thought an admir
able locat ion for an official paper, in
which to publish the judicial adver
tisements, and the acts of tho last
and future sessions of the Legisla
ture. The enterprising and patriot
ic Senator perceived these natural
advantages and started aud carried
on an official paper. We forget its
name—perhaps it was the Starlight
Beacon.
As the gleanings from the plunder
of the previous session! of the Legis
lature was pretty well over, two of
the Senator's most distingu shed
! friends, Mortimer Carr and Mr. De
j wees concluded to tako a little recre
by spending two weeks previ
Jons to the election, witlHhe Senator.
While on the visit, the happy thought
of representing the Parish of DeSoto
occurred lo them. As there was a
negro vote of from fifty to soventy
five to be polled at the Starlight pre
cinct, it was thought^» rratter of the
utmost importance that George
Washington; whoso residenco was
near Mansfield, should be sent for to
superintend the voting at Starlight
George Washington's and his color
ed compeer's name were on the tick
ets to be voted at Starlight, but
when that ofliciiiï Starlight printing
plfess got through with printing
these, there must have been some
twinkling done, for all tho tickets in
tended lor tho other precincts, in

associate, had tho names of Morti

constituents in the other portions of
tho Parish could not read, they voted

Tho Philistines were not half as

offices at New Orleans when Carr

which he told how he had been sent

by Senator Twitchel and Messrs.
Carr and Dewees, and after turning
and twisting their conduct over in
every light in which he was capable
of reviewing it, culminated in the
following apostrophe: "Men I'll just

Whiteficld and Wesley.
We know that our readers will
thank us for tho following descrip
tion, taken from the British Quar
terly Review, of the greatest orator
the world ever produced; and the
contrast between him and his great
compecr, whose oratory seldom rose
beyond penetrating good sense—
but the still white and soundless
heat of whose fervor was more at
fectnal than what seemed to be tho
more raging flame.

and Chesterfield, and David Hume, and
Gnrrick, and Benjamin Franklin, ' were

this mysterious and marvellous man, an
entire soul of all emliraciinj love and com
paseion, greatly aided the movement;—
equally at home in pr< ;ieliiri.r iu the select,

ted Mini ; and this, notwithstanding t,li;>
melody of that full, clear, all encompass
ing voice, varying to every passionate ac
cent, sinkiriL' to the most penetrating en
treaty, .swelling to the most rousing apos
trophe. In the full careering heat lif his
speech, Whiteficld been me, unconsciously
to himself, poet, philosopher, psycholo
gist, thus enabling us to understand some
thing of his stupendous power, even while
we are still perplexed as to its cause. No
melody or poetry shines through the

pictures we have ever met with of inspired,

ed—melted to tears.
But Wealo.y's success ! Wesley, as an
orator.seems still more inconceivable, lly
all accounts Whitel'ield was seraphic.
Wesley seldom rose beyond penetrating
good sense, and nothing appears to have
transported liiin out of his invariable calm.
Yet the effects of his oratory were even
still more wonderful ; there wasMtmct hing
of magnetism in it. Henry Moore, his
great, friend, says, ' At this moment,! well
remember my first thought after hcariti"
him preach nearly fifty years ago ; spirit nut
tilings are natural things to that man.'
In innuiner ible instances find an
diences shaken as by iv n%hty wind,
hurled down, agonizing, screaming aloud ;
there was much more «('all this iu Wesley's
preaching than iu Whitefield's. yet 'ii
Whitefield's wo should expect it* more
Wesley, in the style of Iiis oratory, seems
to have been judicial, and our readers are
not, unaware of the lemarkable power that
quiet statement is able to exercise. Who
passionless apparently as Jonathan
Edwards, a man who would have disdained
every approach to sensationalism, whose
entire mode of pulpit delivery was obnox
ious to all ideas of pulpit oratory, ami
whose whole scheme of thought and ex
pression were as calm and clear :»s logical
metaphysics could make litem ? vet, what
scenes lie witnessed when lie preached?
Thus it was eminently with Wesley;
crowds thronged around him intent to
listen wherever he appeared; if the face
was beautiful, the height of the bo.1v was
so far bencatii the average standard that
il seems almost contemptible for the hold
ing of such powers as ho wielded ; and
then the voice, not less than tho manner,
appears to have been unfitted to earrv
tempests of passion—nor did he desire that
it should; we suppose that it must have
been singularly clear and penetrating, and
that, every sentence was slim ply cut, and
elaborated, not, by prepaiatiou and the
pen, but by con viciions deep and indelible,
Such sentences carried upon a clear pone
tiating voice—aud iu oratory the voice is
all but everything—willjucliieve more than
more plausible means. If, is fervoAr
which liies. but fei vour often burns more
effectually in the still, white, soundless
heat, than iu what seems to ho the most
raging Haute.
