LET . AE AN OUTLE T.
S.The mdst practical of all the rail- SC
told chemres yet proposed, and re
the one that would prove more ad
beneficial to this section than any "
other, is the building of a road that gri
~ill connect Lafayette with one of Hg
tbe-systems running on the othe side
of the lssissippi fivet. The dis- we
tance is about fifty or sixty miles, o,
two hours' ride to Baton Rouge, sta
besides affording to the people an Th
outlet for their products. As it pe'
is now, they are shut out from the an
Western markets. Truck farming, ap
the only salvation of our farmers, tic
would then be a very remunerative on
" fndustry, while under the present as
n the'iakket facilities are
exceedingly unsltisfactory and the t
Soatthetn Pacfic gets (and can be bit
1MathematicaIly proven) really all the It
--.-net profits from. produce raised in bo
this section; but with a competing pa
line the Chicago and other Western an
markets would be placed within our bl
teach and the actual extortionate H
freight charges would be an impossi- rnt
bility. Such a road would be of hi
iucalcuable good to this section of n
the country. TIe saving on on money sp
paid out yearly for freight would
alone be of such magnitude as to g'
Snake itself felt in a short time.
The old road which was com- c,
tnenced many years ago and which br
is partly built, will, from all appear- no
ances, remain in that condition.
We understand a charter had been
granted the owners of this projected th
road, but should this prove an ob
stacle in the way of the building of m
a new one, we believe it is in the sti
power of the Legislature to remove T1
it. ag
We will have more to say on this sce
later and on the steps to be taken hi
in furtherance of this very desirable '
outlet for our products. fr,
COXE 'S ARMY.
ta
Coxey and his commonweal army gi
has reached Wa'shington, and it will e
be interesting to watch what action nt
may be adopted in order to obtain e
their demands; for it is generally un- rc
derstood that some definite plan of it
proceedure has been adopted, though i
as to whether the different armies fr
are agreed is somewhat doubtful.
To an outsider their long and o
painful march to the capital seems
not only rash but the heighs of L.
folly.- It is evident that the bulk c,
of the armies consists of unemployed 0
workmen and not tramps, as is often p
supposed, and the banding together si
of so many of the laboring men will u
greatly emphasize the abnormal s
condition which permits such a F
thing to be possible. But while it
may emphasize the fact, nevertheless
it can scarcely effect any good and
is more than certain to produce r
harm. The assembling of so many r
unemployed and penniless men will
not influence legislation to any ap
preciable extent, and can only make
the leaders criminally responsible
for whatever deeds of violence may
be committed, and men so situated
are apt to be desperate when
they see their demands refused.
They will scarcely consider their 1
demands unreasonable; or even have 1
patience to wait congress' slow delay;
but precipitate trouble which can
only end in misfortune to them
selves
S... ')Whilst the motives which actuate
:- tese man appeals- to the sympathy
of thernation, for all right minded
men deplore a condition that
deprives more than one fifth of our
population of the means of support,
yet few sensible persons can indorse
the means adopted for securing
relief.
Some" of ourcontemporaries; es
pecially those which opposed Gov.
Foster's election, assert that the
nomination of Mr. Ogden was an
anti-admirristration victory. This
assertion is not tree. State poli
tlcs cut a very small figure in the
canvass, and partisans of the late
10tcEnery factiban did what was done
SOn this line. The Foster people
madeno fight of this character.
Sir. Ogden wae the only one of the
.. :src:inIidates that voted for Judge

When CGov. Northern, of Geor- Un
gia, appointed Pat Walsh, a Roman thl
Catholic, to the United States Sen- CA
ate, riiembers of the American Pro- '1-i
tective Association and other reli- i .e
goious.cranks made furious ass'dalts iltl
upon the governor. Last Saturd!y, Il'
thi
it.v. D)r. J.t,.: Hlawthorne, aleaiding ti
divine of Aitlanta, administered a sa)
s.erh i-ebuke to these fanatics. The red
reverend gentleman delivered a1 If
admirable sermon on the subject of Vol
,"Religious tiberty" which we re- by
gret we cannot reproduce in full. An
He said: thr
'Civil laws which establish one form of na
worship, and forbid or restrict other forms, pei
are based upon the iniquitous and mischiev- its
ous assumption that it is the function of the wil
state to determine -hat is the truel'faith. the
That heresy is the mother of all the religious sal
persecutions, in which the world's best men all
and women *ere sent to prison, to the pil- bit
lory, and to the stake. That heresy re- us'
appears today in an effort to put a recogni- as
tion of Christianity into the organic law of eCr
our republic, and in thle avowed purpose of oi
a great secret combination to prevent men, tic
who holds to a certain religious creed, from an
having any voice in the government under ml
which we live. Down with it! It is the
blackest treason against the rights of man.
It is a devilsh conspiracy against the blood- the
bought freedom bequeathed to us by our the
patriot sires. It is as fiendish as the spirit sto
that kindled the martyr fires of Smithfield, cal
and drenched the soil of France with the tre
blood of liberty-loving and God-fearing
Huguenots. Down with it! Load it with
righteous indignation Brand it with the col
hissing 'on of virtuous scorn. Brain it, me
and dump it back into the place of unclean- tin
ness and outer-darkness from which it da
sprang. no
â€¢''The functions of the state toward reli- pr
gion is.simply to protect it. The protection fai
which it extends to one sect, it must extend
to all -Protestant, Babtist, Jew, fMahamme- %v
dan, and Pagan. Every human being who an
breathes the air of this planet has the
natural right to worship what he pleases,
whether it be God, or pope, or sun, or moon,
or star, or mountain, or tree; and is it the see
solemn duty of the state to protect him in J.
the exercise of that right. IX
"It is a humiliating and galling fact to Al
me, and to millions of other men, that there
still exists in the country, a partial alliance
between religion and civil government. Jo
There is everywhere a growing sentiment
against it. I pray God that I may live to re
see the last vestige of it obliterated, and we
hear ascending from valley and hill-top,
and island and sea, the victorious shout- ne
'Liberty has triumphed: Our country is t
free!' op
"In exempting church property from
taxation, the state patronizes religion. It a
gives to the church whose property it cx- re
exempts, its just proportion of the sum de
needed to defray the expenses of the gov
ernment. This is a violation of the law of th
religious liberty bectuse it compels the Jew, t
the atheist, and the deist to contribute to the g,
support of a religion which they repudiate.
If this city should exempt her barrooms tO
s from taxation, she would thereby compel in
every taxpayer to contribute to the support re
of the barrooms. This would be an out- o,
rage upon the conscience of men who hate oi
S and abhor these crime-breediug institutions. a1
f Is it any less a violation of the rights of he
k conscience to make churches beneficiaries ti
of the city government, And' thereby comn
pel men to support a religion with which tl
they have no sympathy? The burden of st
r supporting any religion should fall only ut
L1 upon those who believe in it, and desire to r
LI see its principles and practices upheld and f,
a promulgatecd.
it "In making appropriations of money for
Christian missions the state makes itself the f
S patron of religion, and thereby violates the
sacred rights of conscience. The govern
:e ment of the United States has done this for
ymany years. It has granted large sums of
L1 money both to Catholics and Protestants to ti
be used in the religious trainining of Amer- ii
ican Indians. I am profoundly astonished
at the congressmen who have voted for such
e oppropr.ations, and I am still nmke
astonished at the people for not protesting
d against this unjust and unconstitutionial J
use of their money. A large share of the
money used for this purpose was taken
from the pockets of Jews. and other non
r believers in the Christian religion. In
c thus compelling them to support Christian
Sity they are robbed of the liberty of con
science. Every person that can read
Sought to know that is a violation of the
Sconstitution of the United States. lie1
ought to know that every congressmen who
e votes for these appropriations violates his
oath of office. But the wrong continues.
The consensus of opinion in every state of
the union is, that the federal governmnent
at has no right to make any such use of the
r people's money. But knowing this, the
t, representatives of the licople for reasons
which they keep' within the solitude of
their own breasts, continue these unlawful
Sappropriations."

te In an interview in New York on
ne Friday, Mr. Chas. M. Stol, of Ken
le tucky, one of 1Mr. Brecinridge's
r. attorneys, who had the difficulty
he with Judge Jere Wilson, said: "'You
Igeray say that Col. Breckinridge will

'lTh surprising majorities of the 44

Illinois are said to be partly dice to A L

this alliance the Chicago Herald M1
says: "Already some of their organs I
realize the danger in the distance. Ii
If Republican papers had not J c
voiced this brutish organization and
by cunning flattery helped it into Mrs
growth, it would not be a factor in A C
American politics. They knew E 1
that the apery it engendered would Mos
naturally tend to help them, es- Her
pecially in local contests. With A C
its aid they have won in some places F
where on high political principles A -
they had honestly lost-in Wiscon- Alf
