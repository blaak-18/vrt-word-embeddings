Where the sheep have to range a
,gt)od dial, and there is bowvsilg andle
eliming to seek for hmrhage, a pure
South Down ram would be prefera
ble to any other, as that breed is de
ciidedly the most active of the anut
tu breeds, and will prosper wherei
the heaviuer bededs woutl do no good
unless they had some feed given theml
daily.
The breed of sheep for any man to
geto is the one best adapted for the
pasturie andi for tile treatile it to
which they will be subjected. And
whatever breed may be setlected, it
will pay to feed them well whenever
the season is sulliciently advanced to
require it ; ad howeve r. hardy the
iowns may be, 'and however littlen
extra feeding they may subsist on,
still it is the fact that it will pay to
fced them liberally, as there are thlree
soulces of increased profit arising
from the single cost of grtlin, oilcake,
or lwhatever is given, viz., mole ,nit
ton, lthe wooli alnd better ulalnire.
laiil kInows the mutton and wool,
from well-fed, ripe sheep, bringi more
per pound, so that to rhe increased
quantity of meat and wool there
Should be added Ihe prlait of a cent
or two per pound ton the whle car
cass, because lime IIl (t always eCinll -
mauls a greater price per pound,
while the wool is also of better quali
ty ilt proportion to the condition of
thle sheep. Then again, as a acddi
tional inducement to feed liberally
with stitimulating foolt , it should be
borne in mind that much less hay is
eaten in winter if other food is used.
tMany people, however, :ae so eare
less in thought as to charge the whole
cost of grain, meal or oil eake, mak.i -

Mail for the gollrwing collactidn of
caints regarding Bermuda grass:
The Southern Cultivator says:
For summer grazing, no grass com
pares with the Bermuda. It com
tines every quality that can be de
tiroed--wi!m grow on any kind sf land,
drought, or close graziog, and does
not impoverish the soil. On the con
trary, land set in it will steadily be
come more fertile.
The Southern Farmer ways ;
Fatd permanent pasture, be it rich
or poor land, hill or bottom, there is
nothing better than Bermuda grass.
