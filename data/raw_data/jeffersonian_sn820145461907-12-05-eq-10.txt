HONEST DEMOCRACY.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: The article on page 9 of
your Jeffersonian of November 14th
contains an article on the money ques
tion which fills the bill. You go to
the Democratic National Convention
jand get that doctrine adopted, and
endorsed, and we can carry the coun
try, with you or Bryan, or Folk, or
Tom Johnson, or Governor Johnson,
of Minnesota, and, what is of more
importance than any man s interest,
that system of money would be worth
more to the country than all the
wai*s since the Revolutionary War.
The present system is the most dis
honest and expensive ever invented
to rob the people and enrich the ene
mies of the people. It is astonishing
that the Americans are so ig
norant as to submit to it so long.
You say it is Jarnagin’s letter. I
supposed it was editorial. Anyhow
that is what ninety-nine out of a hun
dred would endorse if adopted.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: Enclosed please
find chock to renew my subscription
to the Weekly Jeffersonian.
I admire the way in which you net
tled President Lindsay. I am one of
the many carriers in Georgia who did
not go to the Atlanta convention that
would have gone if you had been one
of the spea! rs. For a long time I
have though* tlmi e was something rot
ten up the branch, is why I have not
t: ken more interest in the Rural Car
riers’ Organization. It is right fun
ny to me how he wanted to accuse
you of wanting to bring politics into
the R. L. C. A., -when it was so plain
to me that he had been used as a
cat’s paw by certain unscrupulous
politicians.
Believing that the time is coming
when credit will be given to whom
credit is due,
I remain,
Yours always for the right,
R. FAIN HICKS.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I. want you, if it is con
sistent with your feelings, to give the
law makers of last legislature and
the governor of Georgia some of your
adjectives and pure criticism of that
gang who passed, or revised our pen
sion laws. It will cause a great hard
ship on most of us old peg-legs and
indigent soldiers—myself and Brother
Jesse N. Clement had made arrange
ments to use our money —and 1 know’
that four-fifths of the old soldiers in
Forsyth county are in the same situa
tion. I know one old man, Mr. Goss,
who rented a small farm and promised
to pay 400 pounds of lint cotton for
it, and his old wife got sick, and it
will take all they will make to pay
their rent.
Brother Clement’s wife has been an
invalid for 35 years and he is as in
dustrious a man as is in our county,
works every day on his peg leg.
WATSON'S WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
I fear I will not do justice on this
subject, so would be glad to see some
of your hallelujah licks on the injus
tice of such a change in this law.
If you think proper to publish my
letter, you have the privilege of cor
recting it. You can put it in fewer
words and make it more impressive
than I can.
I have not been able to get any
more subscribers for your Jefferson
ians in some time. I wish they were
read by every person in the United
States. I would be glad to travel for
you, but I am almost to old. I will
do everything in my power for you
and the great cause you are working
for. Believe me, my heart in with
you. What I can do, I will.
Yours truly,
R. E. GUTHRIE.
P. S. —What will become of the
appropriation set apart for our pen
sions?
MR. BODENHAMER PROPOSES A
SENSIBLE PLATFORM.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I rejoice at your fight on
the national banking system. There
lie all our troubles. Being the son
of an old greenbacker who fought
for and supported Peter Cooper for
president in 1876, I am consecrated
to greenbacks, the only scientific cur
rency of our nation. I believe if the
Populists will get together and frame
a platform with the following planks,
we can make a great fight:
1. Direct legislation.
2. Election of United States sena
tors by the people.
3. Government ownership of rail
roads.
4. Postal savings banks.
5. Parcels post.
6. Issuance of money by the gov
ernment, not national banks.
In my humble judgment this plat
form would be enough.
Yours truly,
J. E. BODENHAMER.

Mr. T. D. Darlington, Laurens, S. C.
My Dear Sir: Your favor received.
As there are tw T o Jeffersonians, and
as it is highly important to enter you
for the right one, at the beginning,
please let me know by return mail
whether it is the Weekly Jefferson
ian or the monthly that you desire.
The price of the Weekly is $1; of
the monthly, $1.50, or both together,
$2. You will gave a good time with
either of the Jeffersonians, but you
won’t have the best of times unless
you take both. It is just the reverse
of the truth of the old play where
the hero wishes that one of the dear
charmers were away so that he could
have a good time with the other.
Yours truly,
THOS. E. WATSON.
Let them come.
Yours truly,
T. D. DARLINGTON.

My Dear Sir: I think my year’s
subscription to your weekly magazine
is about up. and I herewith enclose
my check for $1 for another year’s
subscription.
The people of Laurens county are
great admirers of you, and I would
like very much for you to arrange to
come up next spring sometime and
address the Farmers’ Union here at
Laurens court-house. I know you are
a very busy man, but you would never
regret the time spent in coming
here. You would return to your
home gratified with the number of
friends you had in this section of the
State. Kindest regards to you. I am,
Very truly yours,

Lockesburg, Ark., Nov. 17, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Your Jeffersonian is fine,
and this panic demonstrates your
theory on a scientic money. Should
this government circulate a scientific
currency based on the credit of the
nation, as we once had, it would un
cover every head in the world, domi
nate all-navies, capture commerce on
land and sea. All the wealth of the
world, together with the brains,
would be under the American flag in
ten years. *
Oh, for a president and congress
with wisdom to see and realize it, and
manhood enough to enact it into law.
A. J.
I HOPE SO, TOO.

Dear Mr. Watson: You will find
enclosed a check for $2, for which
please renew my subscription to the

hope to be able to send you in some
subscribers in a few days. Wishing
you much success, I am,
Your most sincere friend,

Cushing, Okla., Oct. 24, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: Seeing that my sub
scription to your Weekly Jefferson
ian will soon run out, I herewith en
close $1 for it to keep her a-coming.
I will also send $1 for your maga
zine. I have been a subscriber to
your New York magazine until Judas
C. Q. DeFrance sold you out, then I
quit. I blamed DeFrance more than
I did Col. Mann. It was DeFrance
whom you called from Nebraska and
put him in a well-paid office, and
your reward followed quick, and
therefore I can not stand DeFrance
any longer.
Mr. Watson, I have been with you
even before we belonged to the Farm
ers ’ Alliance, and will be with you to
the end. I will read your publica
tions as long as I live, if I can get
the money in time to pay for them.
Yours faithfully and sincerely for
the cause of the people.
