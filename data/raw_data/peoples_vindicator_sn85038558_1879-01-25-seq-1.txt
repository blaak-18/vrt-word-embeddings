A TERIBLE DEED.
The Encounter li the Woo~s--An Un
pleasant Rbeeoritio-- Do wai n
the Cold. Dark Grave
-Barried Alive- n
Fatal Shot. ti
"Stop r' cried a voice out of alarge, n
low oak- tree, on the edge of the dense a
woodq extending north of the pretty
towu of Salem, Virginia, about one b
o'clock in the afternoon of a very fine
May day, in 1830, "Stop, or I will t
shoot !"
The person to whom this throat ti
was addressed was an ederly gentle-.
man, mounted on a sule, and drese'
ed in the costume of a wealthy farmer.
His broad-brimmed straw hat shaded d
a yellow face, pitted with juall-po
marks, and dotted W th,* mall, d
restless black eyes. He lgoked both
cunning and nsacrupulous. Looking
up to .the.oak tree, he shouted: n
"Who are you ?"
"1 will let you know mighty quick
who I am, Silas MeKinstrey ; but
first take that pistol out of your belt n
and throw it into the thicket. I will
give you one minute for getting rid I
of that pistol. If yeou hesitate I will e
wing you with my rifle. I am a dead e
shot, Silas McKinstrey."
McKinstrey hesitated, but only for b
a moment. Then he threw a way his e
pistol and fixed his eyes with an ex- fi
pression of mingled curiosity and ter
ror upon the oak tree. "
His curiosity was oon satisfied.
From the oak tree glided down a tall, a
slender youth, with a handsome, a
thought somewhat
DESPERATE-LOOKING
Expression of countenance. He t
was clad in the peculiar costume of t
a Western hunter and trapper, and a
long doubled-barreled rifle was slung
round his shoulder.
When Ihe had reached the ground, f
he rushed up to MeKinstrey, and said, s
while Ihe was seising the mule's bDl
die: . e
"Do you know who I am "
"I---I don't--," stammered Me
Kinstrey. E
"Well, I remember your villairnes
countenance very well, old reprobate, R
and I ihould not forget if I had not .i
seen you for fifty years. -But it is not I
been that long since we last met. That
was seven years ago. Yon drove me
from this town thlen."
MeKinotrey, whose face. had chang-"
ed color, upon hearing these words,
suddenly swt asprs to his male, but 1
tbhe youth checked the animal at once,
and, in a halfsanering. half threaten
ilg ot.., saide to the riler :

MeKiastry alighted, whereupon -the
youth gave the hapless mule a tre
mendous kick, and sent him scamp
ering off at a lively rate toward the
town. Then turning toward McKia
strey, with a terrible frown on his
youthful brow, he said: -
I guess you know me now, don't
'you?"
"I guess I do," replied McKistry, 1
shaking like an aspen-leaf. "You

bent upon hinm. to

McKinstry obeyed. heaving a deep p
sigh. ie removed the sod from the i,

At last the coin was discovered. th
Both Bennett and MeKinstrey de- ri
scended into.

eyes, kissed the forehead of his de. f
ceased mother. o0
Then he cut open the seam of her CI
black silk dress, and,. with an e
elamation of triumphant joy, drew 11
from it a folded paper.
He opened it, glanced over it, and ti
put It in his pocket. I.
After hastily cloeing the lid of his i
mothera's colsn, he quickly jumped U
out of the grave.
McKinstrey wanted to follow him. G
"No, villain, you shall remain In o
that grave with your victim," eried
the youth. P
IHe dealt the old man
A TERRIBLE BLOW
On the head with his rifle, whieh a
felled him down senseless. Then he a
shoveled in the earth over him and ti
covered the mound carefully with the g
sod. N
"Ho!" he said to himself. "I am is
more than avenged now, and bhence. t
forth I shall enjoy my wealth. e
He went to a lawyer's ofice in si
Salem, showed him the paper which a
he had just secured, and received the a
following reply : r
* "This will is all right. Can you ti

DICTATOR GRANT.
We begin this week the publica-.
tion of a narrative entitled "Dicta
tor Grant; or, the Overthrow of the to
Republic in 1880." This title s .l- .
ciently. eplaig the; pature o( .'the a
work.. We wilklet. it speak .for itself i
from week to week. . I 1it Should not a
prove to be a true statement of events, t
as far ai the more tragical parts of
the history' are. doneerned, so muoch
the bette for the' country. If, on b
Iie other hand, facts turn out as des
1ilbed by this writer, the Ai rle.iie
public eannot conmplain that they a
have not been warned in time of the a
danger they will incur in yielding up ti
the control of the country to the pat- a
rician class. ii
Nothing is more apparent in the n
current history of the United States
than the fact that a tremendous ef- 3
fort is to be made by a combination '1
of cunning politicians and frightened
conservatives aristocrats to put Grant b
at the head of affairs in this country i
in 1880. e
It is well, known that the Grant fce. Ii
tion has fairly eaptured the mass of a
the Bepublican party; and aristocrat- t
ie Democrate are ready enough for a
his dominion and "strong govern- I
meot." It Is aid that the design is r
to enroll permanent Grant clubs all $
over the country during the present i1
winter, the expense of 'whieh is to be t
paid from a central fond. c
The Washington Post says :
"In short, every remaining partti
san energy ppd resoaurce of radicalism a
will be consentrated upon the name
and fortunes of Grant, and, so far as d
the awkward restraints of a Con- r
grees Democratic in both branches t
will permit, the Radleal managers (
intend to accomplish the gigantic -
task of packing the country to either I
elect Grant in 1880, or bring about a
state of affairs that will enable him I
at their head to seise the Govern-.
ment by a coup d'eft aupon the .1 si t
ration of Hayes' term, irrespectiveet
the resalt of 'eletion." , t
The Wsahipgton correspondent of i
the Chicago. 'Tanes speaks In nearly It
the same wr's, aind concludes:
"The Griat organ her to-day pub- I
lishes a long letter from a correspond- I
eat in South Carolina, who says the I
Republicans of the South are dowi
upon their marrow boner haylng for '
Grant night Cad da."
I Th'hNew York Trlbune saj tatal
r Simon Cameron has no doubt of I
Sant'o 6iecton :- I
'He expects to se the campaign ofe
1880 the liveliest one since that of l
Jackson, nearly a half a century age; t
I because-everybody will bo in earnest,
and Grant will beseatm into olee 1
r with the vote of every Northern
State."'

- York Times givesone oof the rdlest
