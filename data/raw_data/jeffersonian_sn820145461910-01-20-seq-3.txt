Some Questions for John Lee
To oui' Union Brethren:
In the State Union last July, in
Macon, why was it that our State
President, Hon. J. L. Lee, was not
willing to £ace Mr. Gaston in a fair
trial? Why did he pick his commit
tee to investigate and railroad the
matter over Mr. Gaston?
Why does Mr. Lee use stimulants,
and theh when some man outside of
the Union accuses him of being drunk,
take the State Union’s money and
ride over the State to investigate
the charges?
Why did Mr. Lee at one time
claim the Union Collar Company at
Macon as a Union institution and
then, later on, claim that the State
Union had nothing to do with it at
all?
Why did Mr. Lee, Mr. Duckworth
and Gulatt work so hard to get Mr.
W. W. Webb to resign his position
as president of the Consolidated
Warehouse Company?
Why did Mr. Duckworth and this
ring insist on Mr. Webb being in
Union City, by telegraphing him,
after Mr. Webb had notified them
that his sister was dead and was to
be buried upon that very day? Why
could they not wait on Mr. Webb?
Why do not the stockholders of
the Consolidated Warehouse Com
pany call a meeting at once and have
a report from Mr. Webb? It is their
duty. Why do they not attend to it
at once?
We want to hear from Mr. Webb.
Why do you not call on him for some
light?
Why do you Union people tell all
on the outside, and not call a meeting
at once and investigate all of these
things in a business way? What good
is all this hot air and do nothing?
You say that we need good men;
men of ability and honesty. Will
you get them by telling the world all
that you know?
Haven’t we got men of brain and
integrity yet who can fill our offices
with credit to themselves and the
Union?
Get to work right. If everything
is rotten, as you say, why do you not
get at it in away that will save the
Union, and do yourselves justice?
Have all of our men of brain,
who claim the honor of being farm
ers, gone back on the poor, who can
not help themselves?
Why do you not call your State
meeting together and consider these
questions, that are of so much im
portance to us?
Thanks to the Honorable Thomas
E. Watson for exposing vices of all
kinds. Rally to his aid in this,
boys’—but be careful that you do
not kill one of the best organiza
tions that has ever been recorded in
history since time began, or events
to be recorded.
I am a well-wisher to the Union,
and pray for its success. So take my
advice and do not tell too much,
but call for each county to send its
representatives at some early date
to Macon and investigate and rectify
all mistakes, or put new men at the
helm and push forward.
“A UNION MAN.”
From a Texas Brother
Dear Sir: —I was much pleased to
read in your paper of the 9th an ex
posure of some of the misdeeds of
the leaders of the Farmers’ Union,
who are duping their followers, who
follow them blindly, in . a most
shameful manner. It seems to me
that you are our last hope here in
Texas. Our leaders are trying to
lead us into the boodle Hannacrat
crowd. They have been completely
captured by a crowd of pirates who
have by the influence of some of our
trusted leaders, who wanted a job,
got hold of our paper, The Co-Oper
ator. As you state, two poor, honest
boys, who could not be “handled,”
were forced to sell the paper, by cer
tain leaders, that it might be turned
over to the Hannacrats. I want you
to understand that I am a disgusted
member of the Union, who is not now
working at his job. I have believed
in and worked for reform principles
ever since I was old enough to un
derstand what our real situation, po
litically and industrially, is. I have
followed you through the past and
am willing to follow you on, and I
plead with you to help me expose
this crowd here in Texas who by
their acts are killing our once great
organization. This crowd of pirates
here could not influence honest Chas.
Barrett, our one great leader, so
they have devised means to kill the
National organization as now con
stituted and form one of their own
which the Hannacrats can use. They
have seceded from the National or
ganization, and have set up house
keeping for themselves, with the
boodlers in charge of the household.
In conclusion, Mr. Watson, I beg
you to help us in this fight. Get
into communication with the old,
true and tried leaders of the Union
and Alliance. I will send you a list
of those on whom, in my judgment,
you can rely, if you wish. Continue
to help us, and we will make this
3effersonlan
gang of boodlers rue the day they
ever deliberately planned to sell out
the great organization of most con
fiding farmers.
Very truly,
J. C. CRAWFORD.
Dublin, Texas.
Advises the Farmers’ Union
Dear Sir: —S. T. Harman is a new
subscriber. I have others, when I
can get to see them, who say they will
take the paper. It is hard to get the
people to wake up to their interest.
I find the more I can get them to read
your paper the less persuading it
takes to get them to subscribe. I will
work to get you a nice list for a
Christmas present.
Brother Watson, tell the brother
Union farmers to stand by our brave
and noble T. E. W. for the advice he
is giving to our grand Order. He is
safe and sure as a leader, for I have
been following and watching him
since the days of the nineties; he has
never betrayed his followers, who
are many and still coming.
Brother Watson, you are right on
Socialism and Foreign Missions. May
the God of heaven be with you in
your labors for the common people,
and may your bright mind and bril
liant pen be the means of saving our
beloved country from Roman Catholi
cism. Oh, that there could be an
awakening of the people and in 1912
land the best friend of the laboring
people in the President’s chair, which
is Thomas E. Watson, of Georgia.
This is my prayer from my heart.
May God bless you and yours.
I remain,
Yours in this fight,
JAS. H. DAVIS.
Grapevine, Texas.
“ For a Fair Fight ”
Dear Sir: —I have been reading
the charges against Duck, Ladson
and Boodlehammer, and I fully en
dorse everything you say. I know
you can prove everything you have
said. If they know that it is not
true, why don’t they come out like
men and prove it not to be true.
Now, they know all you have said is
true, and, like the song, “The half
has never been told.” They want
you to stop, but don’t stop,—lay on
the lash. You can get all the help
you want.
I am a Farmers’ Union man, and
one who stands for the right, and
we don’t need any such men in our
business. We have been fooled by
such men enough. I am going to
do all in my power to see you a
fair fight, and if every member of
the Union was like me, such men
would go out in a hurry. I have
been following after you ever since
1892, and have not caught you in a
falsehood yet. Was with you then,
and am with you now, and will be
with you until death takes me away,
and then I pray to God that we
will strike home across the river,
where there will be no pain nor sor
row, and will hear the welcome call,
“Come up here, my good and faith
ful servant.”
Yours for truth and justice,
Metter, Ga. E. B. HILL.
Texas Will Not Secede
Some of the leading Farmers’ Un
ion men of the State, who came to
gether informally in this city, this
week, were very much agitated over
the recent move of the State Union
officials to pull away from the Na
tional Union, and after close consul
tation over the situation agreed to
issue the following appeal to the
Farmers’ Union membership of
Texas, and the statement was hand
ed to the Associated Press reporter
tonight, which invites a conference
to be held in Waco, January 28,
1910.
To the Loyal Farmers’ Union Men of
Texas:
The Farmers’ Union of Texas is
facing a crisis, in that the organiza
tion is threatened with division and
strife, which is sure to result in frag
mentary factions, and in the ultimate
dismemberment of our great Union of
farmers.
Realizing this deplorable situa
tion, we issue this appeal to all those
who desire equity and peace in our
great movement to consider the dis
astrous results that will follow, in
case our organization is rended in
twain, as is proposed by the seces
sion of our Texas Union from the
great compact of the sisterhood of
States.
We want unity and peace, that
our efforts may be united in the
work of achieving the objects of the
primary declarations the founders
of the movement, instead of being
wasted in a fruitless, and senseless
war among ourselves.
If secession were justified and
necessary, an open declaration
should have first been made together
with an assignment of grievances,
and proper time for discussion and
consideration should have been given
to the local membership. After all
the education on the initiative and
referendum, and the oft-repeated de
mand for the use of this popular
method of ascertaining the will of
the people, why should the referen
dum principle have been ignored in
so vital a proposition, involving the
very life of our great body?
We feel that this secession will be
a great injury, if not a fatal stroke,
to the Farmers’ Union, unless speedi
ly recalled.
We know of many local and coun
ty unions that are not going to sur
render the old, sacred charter, and
the memorable name of the F. E.
and C. U. of A.—tear it from the
walls of their schoolhouse, and ruth
