The Origin of Postage-Stamps.
The oligin of the stamp had a
twang of romt lane in it. it was tl hir- s
ty seven yeals ago that lRowland Hill,
while crossing a distl ict in the north t
of England, arrived at the door of an (1
n1111 wlh're a postman had stopped to c
deliver a letter. A young ,ir l came
out to receive it; she turned it over %
nud over in her hand and asked the
price of pIostage. Thl'is was a large
sim, and evidently the girl was poor,
for the postman demanded a shillting.
Slhe sig,.hed sadly, and said the letter
gwas from her brother, but that she
had no money; and so she returnetd
the letter to tho postrnin. Touched t
with pity, Mr. Hill paid the postage e
and gave tlht letter to the girl, who
seemed very much embarrassed.- t
Scarcely had the postuman turned his
hack when the young innlkeeler's
daughter confissted that it. was a trick
between her and her brother. Some I
signs on the envelope told her all she
wanted to know, but the letter con
t ainetl no writing. "We are both soit
poor," she added, "that we invented I
this mode of corresponditng without
paying for our letters." The traveler, t
conttinuting his road, asked himslnelf if
a systemn giving place to such frauds
was not a vhiolus onIe. Ieforo sun
set Rowland had planned to organize t
the postal service on a new basis-
with. what success is known to the
woald.
Judge SpoforIrd and Ex-Gov. t(ellogg.
W,\AtIuO;'roSN, Oct. l.-Ex-Gover- tj
Kellogg and Judge Spfotlrd, of Lon
isian a, the rival claimants for the 1
long term of the United States sen- f
atorship of that State called upon the
P'resident to-day, the latter visiliing _
him for the first time and paying his a
respects. Governor Kellogg went on t
to New York to-night, while Judge
Spoflford will remain here to try to I
divine the probable temper of the sen- t
ate In the matter of his admission. 1h
It will be remembered that he was a
chosen senator by the Nicholls' legis
lature receiving the support of many b
such republicans as Michael IIahn. Hle
belongs to the conservative wing of i,
the Democratic party, an element It
made up largely of the old line whigs, a
who were wchled into union with the (
Democrats by the heat of the rebel- ,
lion.
For this reason the question was fl
put to the Judge to-night whether, in ,
the event of a division in the party a
in the South and in the senate, he h
would not take sides with the suppor
ters of the President as against the c
latter's antagonists. His reply was
that the whole South was supporting Ii
the President, and that it would be ,
time eneugh to talk of meeting is- C
sues when they arose. The politics .
of the past were buried in a very I:
dleep grave. As to his position in the
senate he should represent the peo
ple of his State without rega rd to
parties, but at any future time there
should come such a division of parties
as had been conjectured might be the
effect in the South of the President's a
policy, he shonld seek the benefit of
nil the light lie could get to determine t
which side wl the tight one, and put
hlimselfin harmony with it.
In saying that the whole South was 1
now snplportiLg the President lie
wished to have it understood that c
the indictment of the returning hnard
in Louisiana had been wrongly used a
as an argument in the North to prove
that there wa.s an unfriendly feeling
to the President, whereas the fact
was that the indictment had been
Used upon the alteration of a return
of only 6f50 votes in one parish, that
of Vernon. This retnrn, whatever
its honest charaneter, made neither
Mr. IIayes' title to the 'lPresidency
less valid nor Mr. Tilden's election
the more probable, or vice versa.
The object was to punish crime and
deter its repetition. It was never
leveled at the President.--[Cor. N.
Y. Herald.
THE "Dismal Swamp" is said to be
an entire misunomer. There is noth
ing dismal about it except its general
solitude, It is described by recent
visitors as a capital resort for sports
men, game being abucdant, and fish
ready to rise to the fly. The most
curious features of the swamp ate
the sweetness and wholesome char
acter of the water, and the entire
freedom of its few inhabitants from
nmalations diseases. This purity is
ascribed to the influence of the junip
vr tree, which certainly colors if it
does not implove the water, and pos
4ibly contlihttes an antiseptic prop
erty to the air.
