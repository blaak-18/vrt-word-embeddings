What We Object To.
Louisiana and Lonisianian's have
seen and suffered manifold troubles,
trialsand tribulations, for near two
decades. The war and its calamities
swept over her fair bosom, and after
it, came the worse than war and its
devastation. The carpet-bagger and
negro ruler. In all this time her trne
sons fought manfully the good fight;
they piled up, mountain high, proof
of their capacity for endurance. They
met death. They died. There has
been a deserter heroe and there. Many
and many a noble, true-hearted man
who unfurled his banner with us,
nigh ten weary years agone, cheers
as no longer with his voice or gives
us the pleasure of his company. We
have buried thenm, our dead in princi
ples cause; we have passed on, and
their monuments are green memories
cherished with affection and pride in
our hearts.
But now, the battle is won--the
enemy driven from the field. Prin
ciples banner, God's escutcheon,
waves once more o'er a free people.
The hour for the reward of virtue,
fidelity and loyalty, comes!
And what do we see? Who is it
that wears the Iron Cross-the decor
ation of honor l Who is it that fills
positions of trust, of profit, and of
distinction t
Is is those men who, when brave
hearts and arms were wanted, were
ever ready to respond. Who were
always at the post of danger ?
No! It is the time server, the
wishy-washy, the lick-spittle, the
weak-kneed, or the reformed thief
and the captured enemy. This is the
class of merre aries from whom Lou
isiana officials are chosen, and those
who fought a thousand battles for her
and not one against her, are turned
out with rude rebuff and damning re
sult.
Can such things be and not excite
mrr special wonder ? Where is the
reward of honest patriotism, when a
thief like Pinchback, a bummer like
Roxborough, or an out cast like
Hornsby, wear the decoration of lion
or, and men who fought freedom's
battle in Louisiana from the dawn of
Radicalism until its sun set in degra
dation and infamy, are sold out under
merciless Radical laws to supply mon
ey to pay these same base hirelings
fees so exhorbitant that they are
sucking the life blood of the people.
That is what we complain of! It
is what we object to. Men are noth
ing to as, and their motives must and
shall be judged, here at least, by
their conduct. If we of Louisiana
have changed a government of plun.
derers for one so weak and impotent
as to be unable to protect us-God
help our poor people indeed, for they
need His help.
After all their travails-after ten
years of strife, their haven of refuge
but adoe of sharks, their sight in
sulted by thie presen e of officials,
madeso by appointment, who but a
short time ago strode through our
townsand hamlets, booted and spur
red, dragooning to silence every man
that dared raise his voice to cry out
against his oppressors. Well do our
people ask us, is this what we battled
fort are thieves and scoundrels still
to hold power, to rule us with com
missions from our own leaders ?
We object to it, and every man
with whom we have conversed, de
nounces it, and are determined to
gird on their arms again and continue
to fight until the principles for which
they contend shall, not only be ac
knowledged abroad, but observed at
home.
Every time we hear a man swear
ing never to vote thie democratic tick
et again we think of an old fellow
who tried to run his stock and cotton
"over the old Sabine" and thereby es
cape the payment of his honest debts.
HIe was caught up, however, and
iwhen judgment was rendered againstl
him and his stock seized, he took us
back of the court house, patronizingly
slipped his thumb in the button hole
of our coat and gently said, while de
feat was marked in every lineament,
of his countenance: "Jim, d-d if I
over vote the democratic ticket agin
aslong zi live."
Behind this never "voting the
democratic ticket" there is a pinch
lug private shoe.
The people of Louisiana are in no
condition to be trifled with and our
legislators had better look well to
their condition before asking them
to "wait three or four years" before
the present Constitution is changed
and a new an! cheap one substituted
for it.
qath, of the Cincinnatti Enquirer,
has been employed by Kellogg to
write him up, and Gath is swallowing
Kellogg's lies and dishing them out
at a fearful rate.
MIr. Eustis has been seated at last,
and Louisiana has now, after seven
teen years time, one representative
u the Uujced States Senate.
The State Treasuryship.
In ~187-, Major J. C. Moncure, of
Caddo, was elected State Treasurer I
by the l)emociats of this State, and
by a large majority. He was count
ed out by the Returning Board and
his defeated competitor was installed
in office, which he has held ever
since.
We undert tand that Major Mon
cure has entered suit in the Courts
for the oflice, which Courts are now
presided over by Judges of the peo
ple's selection. Is it not time that
there should be a decision in the
case? A case involving the very es
tence of American liberty-the sa.
credness of a patriot's ballot. Have
we been all along mistaken about the
Returning Board crime, or was it a
crime at all
The people of this State 'are sad
and sick at heart over their victory,
a victory barren of results to them,
if such things as they contended for
shall be set at nauglht by their chosen
servants. If the thwarting of the
will of a voter by violently refusirng
to count his ballot is a crime fit for
denunciation and not for punishment,
it were well the people were informed
of just how much more fighting is
necessary to linally settle the ques
tion.
Either we have been grossly mis
lead the public; have wantonly as
sailed the Radicals about their ac
tions concerning the Returning Board
count. We have traduced them most
shamlefully-oRn -Major Moncnre is
entitled to the position of Treasurer
of this State. There can be no dodg
ing these points. One or the other is
correct, and we want to see it deci
ded.
Senator Stubbs, (I)em) of Ounachi
t:i, dashes athwart tLe Constitutional
Convention horizon and repents the
old, old story of "this time being not
opportune for holding a Convention."
Mr. Stubbs presents it however in a
new dress, and says, to our confrere
of the Columbia (Caldwell parish)
Herald : that "he considers the in
terests of the people will be best
conserved by the State government
remaining in its present hands till the
expiration of the period for which it
was elected. By that time, the Sena
tor thinks, any misapprehension, or
mistrust, that now remains in the
minds of the colored people will have
passed away, and they, in common
with all good citizens, will be ready
to acquiesce and assist in framing a
Constitution that will inure to the
general well being of all, and to the
developement of the vast resources
of the State."
If any one has an argument to pre
sent against the Constitutional Con
vention and a new Constitution, we
would like to hear it. We have read
such stuff, as the above from MIr. Sen
ator Stubbs, until we are perfectly
sick.
Renew Your Subscriptions.
Our friends must not forget they
are to renew their allegiance to their
paper on or about the first of January,
as a large number of subscriptions
expire on that day. Let each and
every one of our old subscribers
bring with him a new reader, and by
this means we can double our issue
at once.
As an inducement, we will send the
paper one year to an old subscriber
and his new one for FOUR DOLLARS,
or two dollars'each, in advance. We
propose to enlarge as soon after Jan
uary slet as we can. We have made
arrangements for a Power Press and
new material, as we are determined
to give the people, who have been so
cordial in their support to us, not
only the best country paper in the
State, but a country paper second to
nione in ability and mechanical ap
pearance.
Support us, and we will do our
share.
Longstreet complains of the desire
of Democrats to accept office under
ifayes, who was fraudulently elected,
while they denounce him for accept
ing one under Grant, who was hion
estly returned to the Presidential
Chair.
The combination of more than one
action in a sewing machine or agri
ecltural implement increases its val
ne, and we do not wonder at the en
larging demand for Home Stomach
Bitters, with its splendid combina
tions of medicinal virtues.
The Georgia new Constitution was
adopted by a majority of 30.000 votes.
Our friends must not forget that a
large number of their payments for
subscription fall due on January Ist,
next. We have every assurance tlhe
VINDICATOR will continue the friend
ly visitor of a larger number of sub
scribers next year than this.
The "Old line Whigs" have been
aroused, as will be seen from a Com
munication in this weeks issue of the
VINDICATOR, but they have "riz" on
the other side from that which Mr.
Hayes and others anticipated.

no Penalties.
New Orleans, Dec. 7, 1878.
Hon. Allen Jnmuel, State Auditor:
Dear Sir-Your letter of the 4th
inst. has been received and in reply I
have to say that after a careful exam
ination of the whole subj:ct I am of
the opinion that the penalties ought
not to be exacted. By act No. 23
of the regular session these penalties
were remitted provided the taxes
were paid on or before the 1st of
December, 1877. But by act No. 96
(the revenue act) of the extra session,
section 53, it is provided "That the
tax collectors shall on the first Mon
day of November file in the office of
the parish recorder a detailed list,
giving the names of all persons whose
taxes remain unpaid, as well as the
amount of said taxes ; and the filing
thereof shall operate as a legal seiz
ure of the property upon which said
taxes are levied ; and from the date
of said filing said taxes shall bear
eight per cent. per annum interest,
and no other penalty shall be exigi
ble, any previobs law to the contrary
notwithstanding."
In my opinion, this provision is
broad enough to cover all taxes
those of former years as well as those
of the year just closed. I can see no
reason why the Legislature should
have intended to place the delin
quents under the de facto organiza
tion which controlled the State for
four years, in a worse position than
those who have failed to pay taxes to
the Government of their own choice
There is every reason to conclude
that it was the purpose of the Legis
tlature to relieve our people front all
of those excessive penalties laid upon
them for the purpose of compelling
their acquiescence in a Government
not elected by themselves and sternly
iesisted by thcm at every point. I
think the situation of affalirs in Lou
isiana, both past and present, pres
ents a case in which a liberal con
struction, and one looking to the pub
lic welfare, is the true rule'of inter
pretation as applied to these statutes.
I remain, very respectfully,
H. N. OGDEN, Attorney General.
Great relief will be afforded our
poor struggling people by the patriot.

THE VERY LATEST.
Plevna Fallen.
The Bear Destroys the Turk.
Eustis Seated.
Telegraphic to the Shreveport Times.
London, Dec. I1.--Reuters has re
ceived the following:
Bucharest, Dec. 18.--9:40 p. m.
Plevna is now in the hands of the
Russe-Roumanian armies.
The agency at Russe makes the
following announcement: Osman
Pasha's attempt to break through in
the direction of Widden was attacked
in front and compelled to lay down
arms after a struggle in which he was
seriously wounded. All with one
voice praise his conduct.
London, Dec. ll.--Reuter's Tele
grain company has the following:
Bucharest, Monday, Dec. 10.
After a severe engagement yester
day before Plevna, Osman Pasha was
wounded and surrendered uncondi
tionally. Turks in Plevna are dying
of hunger and cold.
London, Dec. ll.-The Times ur
ges that the moment has now arrived
when mediation between Russia and
Turkey is possible and it is to be
hoped the British government will
use all efforts to that effect.
St. Petersburg, Dec. Il.-The news
of the fall of Plevna, occasioned
great rejoicing here. Theatres are
celebrating the victory by special ad
ditions to their usual programmes.
Enthusiastic popular demonstration
in honor of the imperial family and
army are made iu the streets and
public places. Great crowds assem
bled cheering and singing national
airs. The city is partially illumina
ted.
Bogert, Dec. 10.-At 7:30 o'clock
this morning Osman Pasha's entire
army attacked the Russian grenadier
corps holding the line of investment
on the left bank of the river endeav
oring to force a passage. The attack
was made with desperate energy and
a portion of the Turkish troops did
in fact penetrate the line of entre'uch
ments and badteries, but all attempts
to break through the positions of the
grenadiers were ineffectual. After
five hours severe fighting the Turks
were defeated. Osman Pasha was
surrounded on all sides and compell
ed to surrender with his whole army.
Up to the present time it-is impossi.
ble to estimate the number of Turk.
islh prisoners and quantity of materi
al taken. We only know that every
thing in Plevna has fallen into our
hands. Russian losses inconsiderable
compared with the results obtained.
London, Dee. II.-The latest ad
vices from Bucharest put the number
of Turkish prisoners at 40,000. Os.
man Pasha ordered a sortie in the
direction at Widden. His valor,
which is described as desperate, is
everywhere the theme of conversa
tion. The suffering of the Turks in
the beleagnred town was awful. Cold
disease and famine decimated their
ranks and reduced the soldiers to liv.
ing skeletons. To aggravate the suf
ferings no doctor and no medicine
could ie obtained. Osman Pasha
himself was severeely wounded before
hie would consent to surrender.
Bucharest, Dec. 11.-A Te denm
was song here to celebrate the Rues
sians success at Plernva. Prince Gorts.
chakoff and the Russian and Ron
manian authorities were present.
The Czar and Prince Gortschakoff
will return to St. Petersburg in a
week.
The Czar, after the surrender of
Plevna, placed his own carriage and
escort at the disposal of Osman Pasha.

An Appeal.
Editor T indicalor:
Your dignitied, yet scathing and un
answerable article "P'eople's Orgas" in
your last issue, has called forth the
plaudits of not only your pets lnal friends,
but the true mLen o(f the p.rish, and I
have no doubt all over tlhe State wheii
ever the article is read. Nor do I lay
mysellfliab'e to an imputation of flattery,
when I say, that the edifice you then and
tbe:e = reeted, having reason, good sense,
principle and patriotism for its corner
stones, cannot be snecessfully attaekedl
by a dozen regiments of such nanhy,
pamby psut,.do Inlepentdent jonrnals as
the N. 0 Times and Plicayulne. I deny
most emphaticailly, that (Gov. Nicholl car
ried Louisiana by the strength of his
own personal poplularity. lie was but the
instrument of the people, and only prom
ised upon the hustings, to be, if elected,
the Governor of the whole lpeople, and
not of a party. Now, sir, the D)emocrat
ic Conservative party never desired to
elect a mani h.o would be so lost to jus
tice, honesty and patriotism, as to ad
minister the affairs of the State as a vile
and Ihateful partisan. Dishonest and ac
cursed Radicalism did that. No, sir, they
desired to throw oil upon the Euroclydon
waves of personal race hatred, engelider
ed by such political lepers as Kellogg and
Warmoth ; and as F. '. Nicholls had
never been a public man, and as his life
had been one of utmost purity, and his
military history one of great lbrilliancy,
the Convention of the people with great
unanimity named as their standard bear
er during the last canvass. Any other
high toned, and honorable gentleman,
would have received the same support,
and carried the State as triumphantly as
did Gov. Nicholls. That he does, or has
carried out the views ,f those who elect
ed him, is rather mixed yea; inll all verity,
it is patent to all wmen, that he haes not. ec
pecially to those wiho look at his admin
istration through the eyes of reason, in
steadl of the splectacles of prejudice.
A short time since I heard the qnes
tion asked, in New Orleans in the midst
of a corterie of gentlemen, who was Gov
ernor of Louisiana ?" One replied, that
it was a tax collector by the name of
Bond, another, that it was Duncan F.
Kenner and a third, that it was Kenner
and E A. Burke. That a Governor of a
State should have conusellors around
him, is right and proper-but ill the name
of all the gods could ourGovernor not have
found men whose feelings and sentiments
were more in unison with the people
who elected him, than the above non
descript fossil politicians. Where are
the members of the Supreme Court, gen
tlemen of marked standing and ability
men who stood by him, to the knowledge
of the writer of this, in the dark hours
that surroulled hiim from Novemder to
March ? These men were his advisers
tlhen-why could he not have kept them
ini contidence ? For Governor Nicholl,
the writer, has personally the very high
est regard-- but as Governor of the State
of Louisiana, he has a right, as every
voter has to speak his mind freely, frank
ly. patriotically, '"settingdown aught in
malice." If his friends do not chide him,
for what they consider his errors, hisenc
ruies certainly will not. Could the orisons
of every patriot in the State to-day, Ibe
raised to the Bar of the Patriots' Grand
Judge in one rand and ferva' t prayer,
the utterances would be, that the Admnin
istration of Francis T. Nicholls would be
a triumph, and that no act of his would
cause to move in it's coftin, the defunct
carcass of Radicalism, where lie himself,
aided, so faithfully, ardently and gallant
ly to inter it one short year ago ! An
organ, refltecting the views of a party is
as much of a necessity as a leader of the
party, and a recognition of such an organ,
has been recognized since the formation
of the Government ; in fact, it is recog.
nized in all civilized Governments. Du
ring the existence of those two grand old
parties of brains and patriotism--the
Whig and Dcnlocratic-this whole land
from one uend of it to the other, was dot
tedll over with party organsll--and noearly
every village in thle Union, had its two
opposIang Iarty journals. No, if Gov.
Nicholls thinks that he will find more
than a corporals guard to "lick the dag
ger raised to shed their blo ( " he will
find himself most egregiously in error, or
the people by some strange infatuation or
unaccountable metamorphose, have sud
denly lost their manhood and their patriot
15i. No, no, come back Gov. Nicholls
come back, to your people-discard the
Kenners, the Burkes, the Bonds from your
counsel, and take to your embrace, men
tried and true and in whom the people,
who gave you power, have confidence.
Make no more infamous nomuinatione--but
fill all the offices within your gift with
men of honor and probity, patriotisom and
intelligence and say, act, and do, as a
Denmocrat-fofyou know that it was by
them that you were chosen a Ruler---and
over your short-comings, will a valiant,
brave and proud hearted constituency,
throw the broad mantle of their charity.
Come back, we again say, come back,
that is, if you were ever with the people,
for you are wandering after strange div
iditv--a nlew party--is an ignis fatuus,
whilch will lead you into interminable
thorns and brambles, for your true friends
will all tell you, the old Line Whigs will
not gowith you and those that do, are
radicals.
AN OLD LINE WHIG.
THE CIRCUS.- Our readers will bear in
mind that Van Ambhurgh,-one of the ol
dest and most universally esteemed show
men in America-will be in Natchitoches
on Friday and Saturday, 28th and 29th
instants, with one of the finest circuses
and menageries that ever came through
this section of country. Our metropoli.
tan exchanges speak of the circus perfor
mances and menagerie in the most flat
tering terms, and unqualifiedly pronounce
it one of the finest exhibitions now trav
eling in the union. The management faith
fully perform all that is advertised, a
full description of which can he seen by
reference to the small bills. The menag
erie embraces almost every animal known
to natural history. The most interesting
feature of this department is the two
horned rhinoceros- the only animal of
the kind ever exhibited in this country
The country press of the parishes
through which this old reliable and hon.
est company have passed and exhibited
are emphatio in their satisfaction with
the exhibition. They show just what
they say they will, and have done so for
years, for this combination is one of our
oldest if not the very best circus and me
nagerie on wheels. Don't forget the day
and date of thig really excellent treat in
store for both old and young.
