—As a Bird to the Mountain Anne McQueen |
t HE month was May, but the
sun fairly boiled with the
fierce heat of July. The wire
grass by the side of the pow-
T
dery road was crisply withered. The
giant pines, stirred by breaths of hot
air, seemed to moan of thirst and
parched roots, the wire-grass pony,
drawing the clumsy cart, laden with
Jethro Dismukes’s wife and her sick
baby, strained wearily through the
heavy sand. Jethro walked beside
the cart on the slippery grass, to
avoid the baking sand of the road.
Jethro had been “chilling” all the
spring, and, weakened by malaria,
was in poor condition for walking;
but he staggered manfully along,
striving to cheer Lauretta, his wife,
with comforting words. “ ’Tain’t
much further, honey.” said he, cheeri
ly. “We’ll git thar by evenin’,
shore, and then the doctor’ll be
mighty apt to cyo little Sis. Yes,
sir! I ’spect he’ll cyo her right away.
How’s she seem to be doin’, Lau
retta?” He reached over the side of
the cart and touched the little head
on Lauretta’s bosom.
Such a hot little head, throbbing
with fever! Lauretta sat on a mat
tress with the baby in her lap—a
pitiful baby indeed, swollen almost
to bursting, its skin a transparent
yellow from inanition, hardly a red
blood corpuscle in the poor, palpita
ting body, breath coming in short
gasps from cracked lips, which Lau
retta strived to moisten with a rag
dipped in tepid -water in a jug at her
side.
“Don’t seem to me her head’s hot
as ’twas,” said Jethro hopefully.
Lauretta looked up, despair in her
hollow eyes. “My baby’s a-gwine to
die, Jethro,” she said, with dreary
calmness.
The baby stirred from a fitful
sleep, peering from swollen lids into
her mother’s face. “Mara, mam!”
she cried weakly.
“Mammy’s lamb, mammy’s lamb!”
crooned the mother, holding a tin cup
filled with the tepid drink to the ea
ger lips; but, when she tasted it, the
baby pushed the cup away, with a
feeble wail of disappointment.
“Mammy knows the old water’s
hot, but hit’s all she’s got to give her
baby,” murmured the distracted
mother rocking the child back and
forth in a vain endeavor to soothe it.
“Never mind,” said the father
cheerfully, “we’re ’most to town, and
pappy’ll git little Sis a drink o’ nice,
cold ice water soon’s we git thar.
Don’t you go to givin’ up, Lauretta,
honey. I make shore the doctor’ll
cyo her.”
*
Lauretta made no reply; the cart
swayed heavily through the sand, the
silence unbroken save for the baby’s
piteous wail, “Mam, mam!” and the
mother’s ready answer, “Mammy’s
lamb, mammy’s baby!”
Jethro Dismukes and his wife, Lau
retta, were not natives of this flat,
sandy, desolate country, with malaria
rising from stagnant sloughs and
ponds; with hot, bitter lime-water
for drink and lonely stretches of
solemn pine forest for the weary eye
to gaze upon. Only the year before
they had come, a newly married pair,
from the mountains, lured by hope of
better prospects in the turpentine re
gions. In the great forest belonging
to the turpentine company for which
Jethro worked they had settled in one
of the rough board shanties, hastily
put together for the shelter of the
employees and their families.
But nothing seemed to prosper
with Jethro and Lauretta. Provis
ions were scant and prices high at
the company’s commissary. Jethro
took chills and was often unable to
work; and Lauretta, alone as she
was a great part of the time, fell a
victim to that most hopeless of dis
eases, named by physicians nostalgia,
by its victims homesickness. She
thought of her father’s little farm
in the mountains, the log cabin
where the cheerful mother, while her
spinning-wheel whirred busily, sang
old ballads brought from over-sea by
long-forgotten ancestors; and the
troop of hardy children roasted
chestnuts in the ashes of the wide
hearth, and ate them with appetites
made keen by the tonic mountain
air.
And when the sun beat down on
the baked earth and she drank, with
loathing, the warm, bitter water from
the lime sink, how she longed for the
cold, deep spring, whose icy waters
gushed from the mountain-side.
Lauretta might have pined away
and died but for the coming of the
baby to ease her aching heart. Life
seemed full and happy after that till,
with the hot weather and the teeth
ing, the baby sickened, growing
steadily worse as the summer ad
vanced. The simple remedies to be
had at the commissary were tried
without avail. Driven to despair the
parents decided to take the child to
the nearest town, where there were
skilful physicians, and where, also,
certain good women of the place, the
King’s Daughters, had built and sup
ported an emergency hospital for
such children of their Father as
these.
The weariest journey must come
to an end. At last the roofs of the
town, in groves of moss-draped oaks
and huge pecans, came in sight, then
the buildings and then the dusty
streets, where the sand was even
deeper than on the country road.
Here Jethro stopped to inquire the
way to the hospital. It was close by.
The King’s Daughters had built on
the outskirts of the town, where lots
were cneap. Jethro helped Lauretta
and the baby from the cart at the
door of the small white building and
rang the bell.
An old colored woman, the care
taker of the place, came to the door
and bade them enter. “I spec’ de
baby sick!” she exclaimed sympa
thetically. “Come right in de front
room, where it’s cool, and lay it on
de bed; den I’ll go fetch you some
ice water.and ’phone for de doctor.
Ain’t no patients ’tall here now, so
dey ain’t no doctor visitin’.”
All the doctors in the town ten
dered their services to the King’s
Daughters but the physician who an-,
swered the call happened to be
young Dr. Lorimer. Fresh from col
lege and full of enthusiasm, he some-
'Jeffersonian
times cured where more experienced
physicians failed. One glance at the
transparent face of Lauretta’s child
sufficed to show him the gravity of
the case, but he cheered the parents
with hopeful and hearty words, and
going vigorously to work soon had
his tiny patient as comfortable as she
could be made under the circum
stances. This accomplished, the doc
tor indulged in some equally vigor
ous thinking. Only the most careful
and experienced nursing could save
the child, and this the young mother
could not give. Nor could the col
ored nurse whom the King’s Daugh
ters hired when extra attention was
necessary. There was only one way,
decided the doctor, and that would
be to beg Miss Lathrop to take the
case. Now, Miss Lathrop was a
trained nurse who, though she had
retired from professional life, could
sometimes be persuaded to help her
friends out in an emergency. Dr.
Lorimer was her pet physician; he
had recently pulled her through a
serious illness, and he knew she was
waiting for a chance to “pay him
back.”
“It’s a shame,” he thought, “to
take advantage of her gratitude, but,
by George, I’m going to do it!” With
the impetuous young doctor to think
was to act; in a few moments he was
in his buggy speeding on his way to
Miss Lathrop’s pleasant cottage, and
in an incredibly short time that lady,
somewhat breathless from her hur
ried preparations, was seated beside
him, dashing rapidly back to the hos
pital.
Lauretta sat beside the cot, placed
near an open window, to catch the
faint breeze, and moistened the
baby’s lips with a tiny bag of crush
ed ice. Jethro sat at the foot of the
cot and looked on, in helpless man
fashion. Hope had revived in Lau
retta’s breast at the doctor’s first
visit, and now, when he entered with
the capable, strong-faced woman,
whom she instinctively recognized as
a nurse, a power to save only less
than the doctor, her face grew lu
minous with joy.
“Oh,” she whispered as the nurse
placed her firm hand on the baby’s
wrist, “you’ll cyo my baby, won’t
you? You’ll shore and certain cyo
my baby?”
“I hope the doctor and I together
can cure it,” replied Miss Lathrop
kindly, “but you must try and be
brave if the worst should happen,
for your baby is very sick.”
“You just keep your courage up in
the meantime, Mrs. Dismukes,”
spoke the cheery young doctor.
“I’ve got lots of hope since Miss La
throp has consented to nurse the
baby. The best thing you and your
husband can do now is to go to bed
at once. You’re both worn out, and
Miss Lathrop will call you if help is
needed.”
And Lauretta, gazing into the calm,
trustful face of the nurse, knew that
it would be well with the child.
Their hearts at rest, that night she
and Jethro slept the deep, unbroken
sleep of utter exhaustion.
But the baby tossed its feeble
tarms in feyered unrest, peering
through swollen lids at the unfa
miliar face, and wailed “Mam,
mam!” in piteous protest at its
mother’s desertion.
It was late next morning when
Nurse Lathrop sought a few hours’
repose in her own quiet cottage. Be
lore leaving the baby to Lauretta’s
care she sponged its swollen body in
cooling alcohol, clothed it in clean
linen, and gave it the morning
draught of nourishing stimulant.
Day after day she did this, coming
back punctually at nightfall; and
eagerly did Jethro and Lauretta
greet her return, for her presence
brought renewed hope and courage.
Even the baby learned to recognize
her touch as more skilful than its
mother’s, her ample bosom as a
softer resting place than Lauretta’s
emaciated arms, and hushed its
feeble wail at the sound of her voice
singing soothing lullabies in the
quiet night-time.
And the baby grew better; the
fever and swellng subsided, the fee
ble heart grew stronger, and gradu
ally the red blood began to creep
slowly through the wax-like limbs.
Nurse Lathrop, from taking a pro
fessional interest in her patient, be
gan to feel a sincere affection for the
tiny being whose wails were hushed
at her approach, and who nestled on
her bosom with a sigh of content, or
regarded her with a curious look of
satisfaction in its great dark eyes—
eyes full of pathetic beauty, set in a
tiny dark face, in which the nurse
began already to see signs of possi
ble loveliness.
One morning she sat rocking the
baby to sleep before she left it in
Lauretta’s charge for the day, gaz
ing into the pale face and stroking
the sleek, dark head with tender
touches. Finally she rose, sighed,
laid the baby on the cot, and after
her usual careful instructions to the
waiting mother, wended her way
through the quiet, shady streets to
her own home. She lifted the latch
of the white-painted iron gate, walk
ed up the neat path, with its bor
ders of dewy, night-freshened ver
benas, unlochd the front door and
entered th6 dusk of the cool hall.
A big Maltese cat trotted up, rub
bing against her gown with loud
purrs of welcome. In the sitting
room could be heard the doleful
chirping of a pair of canaries—
which speedily changed into a song
of rejoicing as she opera d wide the
windows to let in tie morning
freshness, uncovered the cage and
hung it in the window, then filled the
birds’ drinking-glass with fresh
water, and their saucer with bird
seed.
Out in the backyard could be
heard the hungry cries of broods of
young chickens, impatient for their
morning meal. She lighted a fire in
the shining kitchen stove, set the
kettle to boil, and, before making
any other preparations for her own
breakfast, she mixed a panful of
meal for the chickens. As she open
ed the back door a grave old mas
tiff rose slowly from his bed on the
door mat, and welcomed her with
