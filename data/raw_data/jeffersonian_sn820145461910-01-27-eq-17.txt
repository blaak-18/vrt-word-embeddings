Additional Letters From the People
THE WORKMAN’S SERMON TO
PREACHERS.
Rev. Loy Warwick, Castle of Indo
lence.
Dear Sir: —I note that you are air
ing yourself in Sunday’s Journal,
and presuming to give advice to the
laboring class of people as to how
they should spend Sunday. What do
you know of the physical and men
tal needs of a man who works twelve
to fifteen hours six days in the week
and a few extra on Sundays? Don’t
you think you show a good deal of
the ass’s conceit when you under
take to advise one to come to church
and hear your and other’s ha
rangues in your Sunday booths, where
you spend a couple of hours in the
week dispensing your merchandise,
spurious stuff, at outrageous prices,
and then advise people to come to
hear the Word of God. Do you not
think we can get something better,
far cheaper, if we will read our Bi
bles about fifteen minutes daily after
our work is over, and then would it
not be better to take our little out
ing on Sunday and get physical and
mental rest than to spend miserably
two hours listening to your ha
rangue? Let me ask a few questions:
What do you do six days, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Fri
day, and Saturday? Do you not
stroll, wear your long coat, feast on
charity of others, and on Sunday
deliver your set sermons, and, after
you have finished, feel that every
body should congratulate you for
such a masterly and beautiful dis
course? Please tell us whatyou know
about the discomforts and hardships
of the laborer, and how he works for
the sustenance of his family? Do
you ever enter the homes of the very
poor? Do you have any idea as to
the mental worry and physical ex
haustion of this class of people inci
dent as -to how they are to meet the
needs of their dependents? You old,
fat, hypocritical, Pharisaical drones,
come down from your booths of mer
chandise and help the under dog, de
nounce the damnable system that
keeps him grinding, if perchance you
should hit some one high in your
church. It will do you good and help
the helpless perhaps.

HERE IS A FRIEND, INDEED.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —Some time
ago I wrote The Jeffersonian asking
for a list of the libraries in Georgia,
thinking that to put the Magazine
into them for one year it would be
come indispensable thereafter.
I have at last gotten a catalog of
Georgia libraries from the Atlanta
Library, and wrote all of them ask
ing if they would accept the Maga
zine gratis. I have heard from six
teen and am inclosing my check for
the one-year subscription for each,
also the list of libraries so far heard
from.
Your friend,
C. H. KITTRELL.

HELLO! DR. LOVETT!!! WHAT
ABOUT THIS, PLEASE SIR?
Dear Mr. Watson: —I notice in to
day’s issue of The Jeffersonian, in
the editorial, “Is the Texas Co-
Operator Violating the Law,” that
you state that it is unlawful to carry
subscriptions to a weekly paper long
er than four months.
If this is true, you don’t have to
go all the way to Texas to find a
paper violating the law. Our own
dearly beloved Wesleyan Christian
Advocate carries them from one to
six years over time and sends an in
sulting (almost) letter once in so
long demanding a settlement of their
“account.”
I know one lady who has been
married five or six years and the
paper still comes to her maiden name,
if it hasn’t stopped within the last
six months.
People tell me they would as soon
try to get rid of the “seven years’
itch” as “The Advocate,” once it
starts coming. But they don’t ever
forget to send that dun for four, five,
and six years’ subscriptions.
Respectfully,
TROUP COUNTY FRIEND.

My Dear Mr. Watson: —I have
just read with a great deal of pleas
ure, your book entitled “Waterloo”,
and I want to say that in my humble
judgment it is very fine, and far bet
ter than the description of that great
battle by Victor Hugo. lam one of
those who believe when you think
good of a man’s deeds, to tell him
about it whilst he is living.
Yours most truly,
D. S. HENDERSON.

Dear Brother Watson: —Just want
to give you a word of encourage
ment. You are doing a noble work.
I followed you in the nineties, and
am still with you. Those were hot
old times. I was living then in Dade
county, Georgia, and you know that
Dade was always noted for rock
ribbed Democracy, but we downed
them with Dr. Deakins, you know.
Well, Brother Watson, one of my
old Georgia friends visited me yes
terday, and gave me a dollar to send
for your Jeff Magazine, which you
will find enclosed. If I could get out
1910 CALENDARS.
The International Harvester Com
pany has issued some artistic calen
dars for this year, and you can get
one from any dealer. The Deering
calendar is a picture of a flying ma
chine, a remarkably fine piece of col
or work. The users of McCormick
machines are well taken care of.
The two children as the central
group, with the harvesting scene as
a bottom panel, is a happy con
ception. The Milwaukee calendar
touches the chord of all home senti
ment, and will make a universal ap
peal. A lone mail-carrier, victorious
among slain wolves, on an Alaskan
trail, is pictured in the Champion
calendar. This company also pub
lishes an almanac, which has been
compiled for the purpose of giving
the farmer a ready reference guide
to his work. Their monthly maga
zine, “The Harvester World”, is a
wide-awake, businesslike house or
gan for the men who sell farm ma
chines and implements, and it also
contains general articles of interest
on advanced agriculture.

would try to get you some subscrib
ers to the Jeffs, but am laid up with
a broken leg since last June. I know
you are a very busy man, so f will
saw off.
Yours to the end,

Dear Sir:—Do you know, can you
imagine, the ignorance stalking this
country on this money question?
Ignorance personified, I mean. Ig
norance of the masses of what seems
to be, if they are not, the intelligent
people of our country. .Why, my
dear sir, the proof of their ignor
ance is their argument, and it is
based on illusions they imagine we
financial reform people possess only
as an asset to our vocabulary of
imaginary evils before the country
as a whole.
The real truth of the matter is,
the people are ignorant of the issue,
and they are so biased in their opin
ions they won’t read but the bank
er’s side of the argument, and “let
good enough alone” is their shout.
They don’t study the cause of such
disturbances as the panic of 1907.
All they seem to care for is that
somebody got it straightened out —
no matter at whose expense.
No greater obstacle to the success
of our principles ever lived than
Wm. J. Bryan. With his influence,
he carried the reform masses with
him; and as he had no fixed policy
of his own, he left his subjects to
drift and to be lost to the cause.
