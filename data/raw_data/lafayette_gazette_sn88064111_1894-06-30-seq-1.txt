A Little Leoson for Many Belf
ish Men.
No one doubted that he loved her de
votedly, and yet-they had live in the
same house for nearly fort years
Meanwhile he had become on f the
richest men La kevrille. HI wned
and rented numerous dwelliigs with
all modern luxuries in the way of steam
heat, gas fixtures, bathroom, plate
glass windows, large closets, etc. The
old home possessed none of these ad
vantages It was delightfully situated,
and the garden surrounding it was
ideally beautifuL Mammoth oaks and
wide spreading maples cast deep shad
ows upon the rambling structure s
which Mrs Van DlYke: spent her toll
aomejblater years, and all the people
who drove past were apt to ;say:
"There's a fine old-fashioned sort of
place!" -
Mrs. Van Dyke was accustomed to
hearing iaises of the trees; the nice
cool well water, so much better than
that which ran through the city pipes;
the soft light from sixteen kerosene
lamps. such a relief after blinking
evenings of brilliant gas that was so
trying to the eyes; the cheery comfort
of big blazing coal stoves In midwinter;
the inexpressible deliciousness of fresh
berries from the vines that grew so pro
fusely on the grand old Van Dyke
premises. Comments on the manifpd
blessings. enjoyed by the Van Dykes
,gave Mr. Van Dyke unalloyed satisfac
tion, for bhe waB very proud of the,old
home. Two paramount attachments
were plainly manifested at all times.
He was exceedingly fond of "the old
place," and, let it be remembered, he
loved his wife devotedly.
She had borne him seven healthy,
affectionate and dutiful children, all
of whom were married and settled in
different portions of the"' globe,`- and
who, with their various progeny, were
wont to flock to the ancestral domain
-f6rThanksgivlng,-Christmas and other
holidays, and on different anniversary
ocessions f.Sis. Van IDyke.was there
fore seldom alone, "and almost never
care free for even one week of the year;
and, besides, Mta -Van Dyke was natur
ally inclined to extend off-hand invita
ttons-to all his fren;ds to put up at hts
house 'whenever is. nsitedl their pleas
are or convenience. Not only was he a
very generous and entertaining host,
but, owing to Mrs. Van Dyke's manage
ment, his house was a most restful and
altogether desirable refuge for many
of his relations
Mrs Van Dyke was a woman of un
varying amiability. She was patient
and kind and gentle beyond descrip
tion. Throughout the long years of
their wedded life, her lovivg h-usband
never heard her utter a cormplaint. She
was the last person to go to sleep at
night, and the brst to waken, or at
least to rise in the morning, for forty
seasons. She planned breakfasts and
dinners and suppers innumerable, was
often at the mercy of poor servants,
and was sometimes left for weeks at
a time with none at'all; and yet the
lamps burned every night, and were
filled and trimmed every morning, the
buckees went down and up in the moss
embowered well, the cistern pump
creaked with unbroken regularity, and
Mrs Van Dyke never said a word about
allthose rented houses where -there:

der the broad sheltering trees,m and
yes, though they had been married so
long, made love to his silver-haired
wife! I
"Dear," she said, softly, on one of
these occasions, "why could we not
have city water put in our house? It
would save so much strength."
-'No water like that from the old
well," he replied, and enlarged upon it
•tor agQvmtiWe eloquently.. 'Besides, it
would tear up ,things, and we are so
peaceful and serene ýhdIt I should dre4
the generalsllistiurbance."
'Again, being left without, a servant;
for scyeral, days, The said, pleasantly,
but very appealin'gly: -'"My de r., I wist
we hid-gas in the old home, as ina your
handsome tenements. The cleaning of
so many lamps every morning would
become unnecessary."
. "I hate gas light," he exclaimed.
"Nothing like nice, well shaded kero
sene lampel"
He did no$ have. .to keep them lin
order, and suddenly thinking so. he
added, constlerately, "Don't Uligh so
mady, iny dearest: You' see we'd haveI
to have a long spell of tearing up to
get the pipes in, and it would be a
nuisance, besides destroying much of
the wall paper, etc., that we are at
tached to."
"Yes, that is so." said Mrs. Van Dyke
meekly. But the very next day. il
spite of her lame muscles, she drew
three pails of water, pumped five,
cleaned eight lamps, picked several
quarts of berries, and cooked meals for
a fasily of four relatives of Mnr Van'
Dyke's, who had arrived fora week'dt
visit.
There was not, literally, a single fea
ture of the old home which Mr. Van
Dyke enjoyed that did not tax the phy
sical endurance of his so greatly loved
wife. The light, the water, the shade,
the privilege of entertaining his friends
were all pleasurable to him. But if he
had for one day had all the water to
draw and pump, all the lamps to care
for, all the berries to pick, all the meals
to prepare, perhaps he would have
said: "'Let us have modern conven-'
lences, no matter at what cost or saori
fcle." For he loved Mrs Van Dyke de
votedly.
But this is not to be a long story. It
is merely'an argument to prove how
devotedly Andrew Van Dyke did love
his wife.
She was terribly shocked one day
when he was killed in a runaway acei
dent. More than one consoling and
sympathetic voice reached her after the
funeral services were over: "You have
lost a devoted husband."
"Air. yes, indeed 1 have," said Mrs.
Van Dyke, sincerely, as she copiously
wept.
"You have one great source of cort
fort. He is gone now, but when here
he loved you devotedly."
"Oh, yes, devotedly," she murmured.
In a little less than two weeks, and,
while her eyes were still tearful, and
she seemed to be plunged into a state
of most hopeless grief, Mrs. Van Dyke
might have been seen in the lovely gar
den, clad in deep black, and resting her
rheumatic figure against a large tree.
She was saying: "You may leave thif
one. Cut down all the others."
A few days later many workmer
were busy, for water pipes and gas
pipes and bathrooms and a solariunm
were occupying their attention:
There was a grand transformation.
In -a few weeks the old house was
flooded with-sunlight. Mrs. Van Dyke
was as comfortable at least as her mar
ried daughters in their modern resi
deuces, or as her husband's country
cousins who had' enjoyed' modern im
provements for ten years in advance of
her, or as the tenants who paid her
high rents for their luxuries, not know
ing that anyone 'else .had the right to
collect. In the -midst of her new bless
ings she heard'such sentences as the
iollowing: "Oh, grandma, how beau
tifully you have arranged everything!
How nice not to have any more lamps
to clean and no more water to draw i
and everything so handy! lfow glad'
grandpa would be if he saw you so
comfortable and so free from rhenma
tism, now that the sun gets in!"
"Yes, it would make him very hap

dreamily. "Your grandfather loved
me devotedly."-Ilarper's Bazar.

FARMER AND PLANTER
PEEDING AND REARING HOGS.
- Vew Bamggssflms _m ielatlem to
msat supptly
The present price of hogs is a great
encouragment to farmers to improve
the method, of feeding and rearing
these animals. The increase of con
sumption is due to the improvement in
the character of the meat by reason of
the'vast use of canned provisions. This
has taken the place to an enormousex
'tent of the fat pork formerly used on
ships, in mines, lumber camps and
even in private families. The neces
sity for some provision of meat that
might be kept ready for use every day
ia the year therefore no longer exists,
a~d the former clear mess pork is not
wianted, but in place of it the less fat
bacon and hams that have become
popular, as well as the light fresh
pork that may be had every day in the
year.
.This has totally changed the demand
for pork meats, and small, leaner pigs
that weigh no more than 120 to 150
"ounds are now wanted. And class of
)pigs is really more profitable to the
feeders than the larger animals th.J
must be fed over one winter or two be
fore they are ready for market. The
method of feeding these small pigs is
quite different from that needed for the
larger ones, which were fed mostly on
corn. The modern model pig is not
more than nine or ten months old when
slaughtered, and is reared on clover
pasture, and only finished on corn by
moderate feeding for a month or so.
Indeed, the pigs are always ready for
market, and may be taken direct from
the pasture if a little corn or meal is
given to them while running in the
field, or being fed on the skimmed milk
in dairies. The dairy-fed pigs are the
best of their kind, and fill the needs of
the butchers to perfection. All this is
to be considered, as well as the fct
that the number of pigs coming to the
market is not now a guide as to the
quantity of meat, as it was formerly,
when the average weight was twice
that of the present time. Doubtless
the mistake of not estimating this fact
has led feeders to reduce their stocks
so largely as to cause a deficient sup
ply, with the result of the present
higher prices.
Clover, corn and pigs are the rule
now. And in this new system the
farmer has,as he never hashad before,
a method of improving his land by the
growth of clover for pasture only.
Clover is an excellent substitute for
milk. It affords the nitrogen for the
tnder, quickly-grown flesh, and a lit
tle corn given makes the fat, laid on
between the lean meat, thus making
the typical meat on bacon. And in ad
dition to this good result it adds to the
soil a large supply of the most costly
clement of fertility in the nitrogen de
rived cheaply from the atmosphere by
this invaluable crop. The increased
fertility of the land pays all the cost
of the clover several times over and
leaves the'pigs an almost clear gain.
The old system of estimating the
cost of pork by so many pounds of corn
to the pound of meat will now be
changed to the new one of so many
pounds of meat to an acre of clover.
and the corn will become a mere inci
dent of the cost of feeding. This is the
way of all improvements. Cost of prod
uct is lessened, and the profit is made
by those farmers who study how to im
prove their methods and keep abreast
of the rapidly-changing course of
events. One who does not read or
study fails to meet the new demands
upon him, and is in his ignorance look
ing about in a bewildered condition,
asking himself how it -is that he is
standing all alone, left behind by the
advancing crowd, who have gone out
of sight. And his mournful complaint
is that ''farming does not pay."-WVest
ern Swineherd.
IS SALT A FERTILIZER?
What a German Agrleultural Writer Has
to Say Thereupon.
The use of salt as a fertilizer .has
often been urged, and examples of ap
parently beneficial results have been
cited. But now comes a German writer,
B. voun Herff, and says:
"The use of salt for fertilizing pur
poses is still prevailing to some extent,
and especially in such agricultural re
gions where fertilizers have only re
cently been introduced and where the
principles of artificial manuring are as
yet little understood.
"It is true that salt occasionally pro
duces, upon some crops and upon cer
tain soils, a moderate increase of yield
for a season or two, but the apparent
benefit is not lasting; on the contrary,
such applications leave the soil in an
impoverished condition: that is. a con
tinued application of salts is followed
by decreasing yields. The effect of
common salt is readily explained by
the act that it acts us a solvent upon
potash- compounds contained in the
soil, ailnd potash being plant food,
causes an increased yield. Salt in this
manner acts as a stimulant agd enables
the plant to driai from itsources al.
reday piesriit iti 'th'e s6oT af' nitich
quicker rate .than would be tlhe c-es
unuder'normal. conditions, and instead
of Tncreasig fti;tility it promotes
rapid exhaustion of the soil, which be
comes apparent as soon as the plant
food stored therein hastbeen consumed.
"Any one familiar with agricultural
enemsitry knows that salt does not
contain anrythzin that may 'serve- as
plant nourishment; it is a  ule$ o9mn
pound of chilorine and sdlunm. Chlo
rine, if anything, is injurioutB to plants
(hence the disastrous effect pometimes
observed where .lt is used at the time
of planting, or in.- too large quanti
tier)., while sodium, though not harm

are always and abundantly present in
every soil, and it is not any more ad
Vanutageous to fertiliseE ttlit sodium
than it wousd be to use Land or silioa
sa a fertilizer.
"Now, it has blten recently olaimaed,
by one evidently not familiar ,with the
simplest agricultural puincipe~a, that
soda may take the placeof potinih, and
. "':. -".-.=,- ;- -,  ," i
eoamon soda as a fertilizer. lc'w
sould this be in the face of the fact
that ashes of plants usually contain
ten times as much potash as soda? At
is.true that Prof. Wagner demonstated
that plants, when oversupplied with
sodium, did absorb more of this ingre
dient than they would have done had
the supply been normal. but there is
no experient on record to show that
any plant can live and grow without
potash. The ill-advised farmer, then,
who follows such extravagant theories
and tries to feed his crops with soda
will waste his money and shorten his
erops"'
FOWL LORE.
Things to be Avolded--raetieal Sugges
tions Worth Considering.
To imagine there is any profit in
poultry half cared for or that which is
fed damaged and cheap foods.
To trust to the hired man to care for
and feed the flock, when it should be
known that the owner's interest only
insures proper attention.
To lay mishaps or poor success to
"bad luck," when there is no such
thing as luck in poultry-raising, unless
it is p-luck.
Not to carefully cull over the flocks
early in the fall and sell all the surplus
young roosters and the liens that are
three years old.
To keep too large a flock for the ac
commodations afforded, and thereby
endanger all to the ill effect of undue
crowding.
To conclude cleaning the hen-houses
out once a week is sufficient. This
method compels the poultry to breathe
the atmosphere odorous with their
droppings for six days in the week.
To wait for the hens to become lousy
before using any means to keep down
vermin, when it is known that the
keeping of the flock free from vermin
is the price of almost constant vigi
lance.
To doctor fowls that are badly af
fected with roup, canker or any con
tagious diseases. Better kill at once
rather than subject a fine flock to such
diseases.
Not to study the cause that bring
many ailments to the flock and adopt
preventive metho4d to avoid them.
To feed corn as "~cbnstant diet foi
weeks and then wonder why the hens
lose their appetite, stop laying or lay
soft-shelled eggs.
Not to know that the hens that have
good, comfortable winter quarters do
not require as much food as those
poorly housed, and will probably
yield some eggs during the winter.
Not to know that "poultry powders"
are not required for flocks that are fed
and cared for properly.
Not to have a good supply of leaves,
road dust, crushed oyster shells and
scratching material for sheds, for win.
ter use.
Not to be as regular and have a
stated time to feed the flock as you do
in taking your own meals.
Not to understand the importance
and value there is in having the poul
try tame, and thereby realize how
much more profitable they are than
when wild.
To Piave high roosts, which cause
cases of bumble-foot, accidents and
places where mites become snugly en
sconced, where they can not be easily
dislodged. Have the roosts low and
all on one level.-ialtimore Sun.
Breeding for Ezport.
There is little talk to-day about the
poultry business being overdone. En
gland alone last year imported from
other lands upward of $20,000,000 worth
of eggs and poultry, of which she ob
tained less than $150,000 worth from
her Uncle Sam. American hens,
watched by American heads, can pro
duce eggs as cheaply as any foreign
bird that roosts, and there is no valid
reason why they should not do a large
business for our English cousins. This
is not a question of low wages. The
reason why our trade has heretofore
been so small is because our home de
mand is always greater than the sup
ply, and that demand increases faster
than the supply. There is no industry
offering greater opportunities for live,
energetic, painstaking men and women
than this of egg production. The
possible profits are large, because
the conditions are exacting.-Maine
Farmer.
HERE AND THERE.
-This "all-muscle" view of farmin'
has done a great deal to detract from
the dignity of agriculture.
-Agricilture is full of science, no
other industry or profession furnishing
as much food for thought.
-A good food for a sow with young
pigs is a mixture of equal parts of corn
meal, ground oats and wheat bran.
-Dry axles add double, sometimes
treble, to the labor of a team. Noth
ing pays better than frequently oiling
wagon axles.
-The man who is aroused to secur
ing better stock soon wakes up to the
importance of better care and feeding.
--The best wiy to get a good herd of
dairy cows is to raise them; then, if
they are not what they should be, you
know the reason why.
-Poultry yards should be provided
with drinking troughs so that the
fowls will not be obliged to drink wa
ter from contaminated and stagnant
pools.
- The fact that the number of horses
produced in every country of Europe
is every year decreasing, should en
courage our horse breeders to prepare
for the inevitable demand that must
soon come from that source.
-The festive cut-worm has been
getting in his work in Tennessee se
the most destruetive way. Whole
fields of corn have been cut down and
had to be planted over. Fields of
grass and clover in some eases have
been eaten up as completely as if theyI
were burnt over by fire.
-Now is the time to whitewash and
get the houses cleaned before the hot
weather sets in; do it thoroughly and
well, see that every erabk receives its
portion. Hot weather breeds vermin,
and every precaution should be talces
to have everything per egu:

MAN'S LOWEST ESB.
&Uettarlla Aberliasese thbe met Degraded
of Human elagss.
Ethnologists are agreed that I.
their primitive estate savage men are '
found at the lowest known point of
human development in the Australian
wilderness.
Very little is known of the ethnology
or early history of the inhabitants of
the great island continent.
Chinese history shows that these peo
pie were aware of the existence and po
sition of Australia for centuries before
the time of Christ and for at least two
thousand five hundred years before its
discovery by navigators from western
Europe.
The Malaynesian peoples to the
north and west, probably those from
Papua or Borneo, at ones time speard
over a considerable portion of Austra
lia.
Even yet we know comparatively lit
tle. about the Bushmen and their lives
in the dense wilderness of the untamed
interior.
When a coast schooner landed me at
Geraldton, on the far west coast of
Australia, says Dr. Eugene Stander. I
had the impression that a trip of a few
miles inland would bring me to numer
ous settlements of the aborigines.
I made a tedious trip of about three
hundred and fifty miles into the deso
late interior, beyond Lake Austin, and
well over to the edge of the Great Vic
toria desert, without having discovered
a single trace of the savages.
The semi-civilized wretches that I
met were indeed a sorry lot. The
worst of the Hottentots of Africa, of
the Caribs in the interior of Dutch
Guiana, or of the Africans in Hayti,
are a sufficiently bad lot to make one
feel that civilization is hopeless in
their case; but they are all, physical
ly, intellectually and morally, far be
yond and above these degraded crea
tures.
They had one, only one, reason for
desiring to ward of death, and that
great reason was-grog! Enforced pro
hibition in that region would quickly
result in the total extermination of
these miserable wretches, who would do
nothing to ward off their doom if their
beloved rum was taken from them.
The aborigines are a black-brown
people n ith hanging lower lip, promi
nent cheek bones, high but narrow
foreheads, flattened noses, and very
long, coarse black hair. The latter
characteristic is their chief difference
from African negroes.
I was warned that "spearing white
men" was the principal enjoyment of
these savages, and I was led to believe
that to attempt to live so close to them I
asto be able to observe their habits
would be sure death.
Yet there, as often elsewhere, I found
that the golden rule was an excellent
safeguard and "open sesame," and that
it was but necessary to once impress
upon them my kindly intentions and
my willingness to share food with
aboriginal visitors to assure me fair
treatment.
The trying climate, with its long pe
riods of drought, and the absence of
any of the Ruminata or cattle tribe,
must always have made the lives of
these Australian aborigines more dif
ficult, and have subjected them to
greater hardships than have been
known elsewhere outside of the polar
zones.
The scarcity of food has given rise to
a degree of selfishness at meals that is
far worse than anything to be observed
elsewhere. I was a witness to how this
shows itself one day.
I had strolled over to their camp just
after sending them a wallaby I had
shot. So eager were they for food that
they had not stopped to more than half
cook the flesh, and when I arrived they
were already at the feast.
The four men and two youths were
sitting huddled closely together, tear
ing the more toothsome bits of meat
from the bone. As soon as a bone was
half picked they carelessly threw it
over their shoulders toward where the
five women of the party sat together.
The women scrambled for each bone,
and when they were done with it there
was not a great deal of flesh remain
ing. Yet what remained was expected
to suffice for the dozen or more naked
children from four up to fourteen, to
whom, in turn, the bones were thrown
over the shoulders of the woman.
This was pretty short allowance for
that half-fa ished horde of young-,
sters, yet, as five or six half-wild dogs
struggled and snapped for the bones
with them, they did not always get
even that little.
My half-breed guide and interpreter
told me that it never occurred to the
parents that it was their duty to see
that their children had sufficient food.
In fact, were they to become pressed
for their own dinners beyond endur
ance, he thought that one of the fattest
of the youngsters would be in grave
danger of having to serve in that ca
pacity.-Boston Globe.

A KABYLE MARRIAGE.
An Interesting Ceremony That Is Not Al
together Unique.
The ceremony among the Kabyles is
interesting because of its comparative
resemblance to the customs of the old
Greeks and Romans, and even to those
which still prevail in sequestered parts
of France. Here is the girl's father
who exacts a wedding portion, a sum
of about eight pounds, fpr which the
bridegroom has generally to rely upon
the advances of his friends. Often,
too, the young man has not a house for
his bride, in which case his friends set
to work and build one-no very difflt
cult matter.
On the wedding day the bride is led
through the villages in the neighbor
hood, mounted on a mule, and escorted
by friends and relanibk-i4vho shout
and fire guns again and again. The
various householders hasten forth to
offer her a sieveful of beans, nuts, or -
dried figs. Of these she takes a hap4,a
ful, which she kisses and then neplnaqes~
in the sieve. All the offeringrs are eoil&'
lected in sacks by the old womecr-.0t
the procession as contributions • to
young people's larder.
At the bridegroom's house the PgtiS' . ,
hands are washed with liq tt, .
Then they give 'her some" -' r
which she breaks on the _mule's head
