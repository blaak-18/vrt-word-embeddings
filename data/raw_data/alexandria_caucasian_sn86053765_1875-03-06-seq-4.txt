ITm vetk ftftertlM^Dake had of
foml (hit ämigbter, tbe Prince
started «brSwiegiMüWa with the
intention of looking at tlie fair fitce
of Adellaa.
The
CflAPTEB IH.
Prince was van,tiering
gayly singing :
*Td be <v butterfly.
Burn. In a bower,"
when bis oyea fell upon a lovely
Chimpansee aitting in a shallow
brook, lacking • cocoanut. She
was the loveliest creatnre lie had
ever acen. Hin heart was touched
at ones. He raised his eyeglass
and started at her nntil her eye«
fell in rnodeat confusion.
t "Pair Chimpansee," *aid be, 5 !

•'Adeliaa," whispered she.
The Doebeaa de Chimpanzee,
who had witnessed the meeting
from behind a clump ot bnsliea.
chuckled and slid off on her left
left ear.
"Adelita, r sighed the Prince,
''thou art—aw—beautiful J Wilt
thon —aw—marry me F ,
The Lady Adeliza threw the re
mains of her coeoannt «t tbe head
ot a Chimpanzee who was loafing
in a neighboring tree, fell into the
« ram of tlie Prince and gently mur
mnred, "I am thine"
They were married in great splen
dor. The Bight jiev. Bishop Bah
boon, assisted by the Key. Simia
<l»r Ape, performed the ceremony.
The bridesmaids wore their natural
clothes. Tlie choir saug the lovely
si ot liera. "Monkey Married the Bab
Imon's Sister." Lady Adeliza and
lier parents rubbed noses, and then
the bride started on her tour on an
elephant with oue trunk.
chapter iv.
The seasons changed; Summer
lapsed into Autumn, Autnmn into
Winter, Winter into Spring. Then
there was a great rejoicing, for the
Lady Adeliza gavei.be Priuco an
heir. The child, however, was an
anomaly in that regiou ; it had no
tail, it had flat feet, it bad a white
skin, it. had no hair on its body.
All the wise men examined it. It
was not an orang ou tang, it was
not a chimpanzee ; evidently it was
"ii uew species.. Then a family con
clave was called.
"What shall we call it !" asked
everybody.
Tlie Duchess de Chimpanzee,
who was languidly making mud
pies, said: e
•♦Let's call it— Man."-[n. 1*.

He Thonght it was Eeliritaa Tremens.
Sil ifives brought bis two week's
spree to a close on Thursday night,
lie lay on a lounge in tbe parlor,
feeling as mean as sour lager, when
M>mething in the corner ot the room
attracted bis attention, liaising
on bis elbow he gazed steadily at
it. Bubbing his eyes, he stared
again, and as be stared his terror
grew. Calling his wile, he asked
ltoorsely :
"Mirandy.'what is that V
"What is what, Likey !"
SnifHes*s name is Lycnrgns, and
Iiis wife calls biin Likey tor short
and sweet.
"Why that—that—thing in the
corner," said the frightened man,
poiutiug'at it with a hand shaking
like a politician.
"Likely, dear, I see nothing,? re
plied the woman.
"What, you don't see it!" he
shrieked! "Then I've got 'em. Oh.
heavens ! bring me the Bible. Mi
randy, bring it quick ! Here, here
on th;8 sacred book I swear never
to touch a dropot Whiskey. Ifl
break my vow, may my right hand
cleave to the roof of my mouth,
and—"
Here» catching another glimpse
of tbe terrible object be clutched
bis wile and Jtegged in piteous
tones:
"Don't leave me—don't leave
yonr Likey," and burying his face
in the folds ot ber dress, he sobbed
and moaned himself into a troubled
aJeep. j9K
Then his wife stole gently to the
comer, picked up the toy snake
and threw it Into the stove.

the manner of the drawing. . It was fair,
