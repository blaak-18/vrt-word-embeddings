A Handsome Structure.
A representative of this paper had
occasion to go to St. Martinville
last week and while there was shown r
the new building recently erected by ,
the Sisters of Mercy. It is the t
hansomest structure in the town and
reflects much credit upon the buil
der, Mr. A. V. Fleming as a skill
ful workman. When the good sis
ters established a convent in St.
Martinville about 15 ye.ars ago,
their home was then a very mod
est one, but the people of the town
were not loath to appreciate the
worth of this splendid institution,
and extended to it every encourage
ment. The consequence was that the c
convent went on improving year by
year and to-day it enjoys the merited a
reputation of being one of the fore- c
most temples of learning in the
State.
Coming for Deandy. a
Sheriff Droussard has recived a !
telegramn from Sheriff Mahles of 1
E'ureka Springs, Ark., stating- c
he would soon be in Lafayette for 1,
the man A. J. I)eady, who sur- t
rendered to the authorities here t
last week, an account of which ap- c
peared in the last issue of this pa
per. l)eady expressed his willing
ness to go to Arkans:as witioult the!
requisition papers, which fact was .
wired to Sheriff Mahle..
It seems that l)eady has a wife t
and two children at Hou:na, where a
he is well-known. Mr. Bonvillain,
of the latter place,. was in ILafa
yctte this wecek and visited the un- r
fortunate man in the jail. Mr. f
Bonvillain says that Deady while 11
in his employ was always attentive P
to his duties and was a good work- f
man, always behaved well and en- j
joyed the esteem of all who knew r
him.
An Eloquent Divine. s
Father D'Hommee, the eloquent
divine from Washington, La., has
preached two sermons at the Catho- ti
lic church since the beginning of a
Lent. The reverend father is an a
orator of great ability and the fact a
that he will preach at this place
during the lenten season is a source
of much gratification to the mem- 1
bers of the Catholic church. Sel
dom have the people of this town s
had the opportunity to listen to a b
more eloquent and earnest preacher. ti
His sermons can not fail of accom
plishing much good in the cause of
the Saviour.
Slot Machine Fiend. c
Lafayette has within its corporate ,
limits an individual who is nursing. s
a diabolical grudge against slot ma- a
chines. He is waging a relentless ,
war against these modern contriv
ances, which seem to be as numerous
as the sands of the sea. Some days 9
ago one of these inoffensive ma
chines was the victim of his crusade h
and early Thursday morning he c
made a raid at McDaniel's and car- i
ried away two of these splendid ,
nickle-gatherers and at the same it
time relieved Mr. McDaniel ti
of over nine dollars besides about
eight dollars in the machines. e
The next morning the machines ri
were found a short distance from u
the saloon, but they had been rob
bed of their contents. Like Jack -
the Ripper, this fiend accomplished n
his purpose, left his victims lifeless
on the ground and continued on in i cl
his mad career unseen by citizen or I
police._ i

An Accomplice.

and Veazey arrested a negro named
Andre Gary and lodged him in jail.
Gary is charged with being an ac
complice in the waylaying of Jor
don Benton some timae ago. He
was arrested upon information fur
nished the officers by Navarre who
was charged with the crime at the
time it was committed.
A Clever Capture.
Sheriff Broussard has no sympa
thy for the man who makes it his
business to beat boarding houses.
In fact there is no greater pleasure
for him than to run to earth these
unscrupulous fellows. When he
hears that a man has jumped, his
board bill through pure rascality
Ike leaves no stone unturned to
catch the culprit and he always suc
ceeds-for history fails to record
a single case wherein he failed to
capture a boarding-house beat.
The last arrest for this offense was
made by the sheriff last \W'ecnes
day afternoon iturnediately after the
arrival of the*west-boutnd train. lHe
had been inr)or:oeil that a man Ihad
left the Provost hotel at Jeannerette
during the night without settling for
his board before takinr his delpar
ture. The sheriff looked around
the train for his man .tn.l finally
eyed a. p.a 5sentcer co.l ',fortably seated
in the car, i ho, an-;w ered the de
scription which had been given him.
Sile walked! up to the suspect and
told himi what his mission was. The
piassenger stountl)y dical the accusa
tion and said1 his name was W\Villiamn;
and not llagwell and added that hi
had never been in leannerctte, bt
the sheriff in.,isted that he was the
right man and was about to send
for a certain gentleman to identiify
him when he ad.nitted his guilt and
paid the amount, Sr5, which he had
failed to pay to Mr. Provost at
Jeannetette. Mr. Broussard then
released his prisoner and telep honed
Mr. Provost to draw on him for the
sum collected.

Giving the News.
Publishers and editors are a much
abused class, and their principal ac
cusers and condemners are those
who never advertise, who never sub
scribe for the paper, who never give
a single news item, and who are al
ways ranting about howgood a news
paper is somewhere else.
That is all bosh, and there are
just as good newspapers in one place
as in another, with this proviso,
however, that the people of the
community in which the newspaper
is published, will patronize it, atld
vertise in it, and when asked for anr i
item of news, give it instead of shut
ting right up like a turtle it its shell.
If you know anything that inter
ests you, why, tell the newspaper
reporter about it and he will fix it
up so it will interest many besides
yourself. Then, in that manner, the
paper contains local news. But it's
'no use thinking local news can be
gleaned when everybody remains
closemouthed and to the query.
"What's the news?" reply, '"Noth
ing." There is a moral to all this.

dence of her daughter-in-law, Mrs.
Edward Mouton, near this town.
The venerable lady had been ill
several weeks and a few days ago

the once robust system that it was
only a question of time when death
would end her sufferings. Her
last moments were passed sur
rounded by devoted children and
grandchildren who did all in their
power to prolong if possible ' the
life of their beloved parent, but
despite all their affectionate care
and the skill of physicians, the life
of this ttue Christian-woniart was

grel? Fine dog, that,-Thoroughly
trained, and one of the most intelli
gent animals that ever occupied a
high position in- dogdom. Having a
knowledgd of its capacity, and full
faith in its honesty; Ike thought he
would" utilize :b services of his
dog, and train him to run errands
for the family. With a basket and
a dime his dogship was sent every
morning to the ice depot to pur
chase and pay for the day's allow
ance of frozen water. Things
went swimmingly for a few days,
exactly according to programme.
A.t the end of the month however,
Ike was much surprised by a visit
from Mr. Icicle, demanding settle
ment for ice furnished the three
weeks previous, this in spite of the
fact that the regulation dime had
beeh sent . daily for settlement.
'Soinething was clearly wrong: All
of Ike's latent detective ability was
aroused. Ike could not allov it to
go abroad that the. high sheriff of
-Lafayette Parish hat 'been outwit
ted. -The culprit. be he man -or
beast, must be run to earth. Next
morning the carfully trained canine
was given his basket and dime as
usual, and coItnanded to go forth
and invest that amount in ice. He
went and his proud master followed.
What was poor Ike's surprise; to
find that the dog went straight to
Otto's, purchased a choice piece of
meat, paid cash for it, put it where
it would do him the most good, and
then proceeded leisurely to the ice
house; where he bought a dime's
worth of.ice on credit. The mys
tery was solved. Two tears cours
ing down the manly cheeks of poor
Isaac spoke plainer than words,
that his very life's hope had been
shattered.
