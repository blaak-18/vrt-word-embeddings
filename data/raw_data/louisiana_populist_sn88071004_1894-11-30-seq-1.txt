A BANKRUPT ?7 NATION.
A (rittleoum of thi1 I in ,ni:tl hlot Indlllged
in by Ir'ilty I"Isece in tie:' La.a t.
1\Ve lip froin ii the to;.ril columrin s
f; 1) e:.,ttrn daily of c~nniderabl- cir
eulation. and l-presumably of -one in
ltt"nce. the follo , in-g paragraph,
whiich, for dntviri_,it untruth or
grotesque imlbecilits., is almbut unap
proacha ble:
"The credit of the I nitell States rests
upruol gl1. Every piece of paIlpr out
btandinat deper.di f,,"r val e absolutely
upon the abilit of the government
to meet every olliiation in gold.
Here, then. is a currencvy of over one
thousand millions deplndent upon the.
faith of the I nited State,. which faith
is based. upon the rapidly lisa lpear
ing gold reserve which now amounts
to about .,5..0oil ti only. 'Think of it!
Fifty-five millions Isac'c of over one
thou.sant millions."
This is the sort of foo ulpon which
the blind adorers of "honeist" money
thrive! Flromi such sources of profound
financial wisdom the thoughtless or
superficial realer derives his knowl
edtge of the mysteries of ftinance!
Let us see. .According to this state
ment. this great republic. with its $;o.
ti00.0n).p:) of assets, has a credit of only
5"5.0o.oo.(). OIf our outstanding cur
rency. anlrregating more than l.ciii,
itot,(M5I only one-twentieth is good. the
remainder worthless' If a few banks
sihoutl gather up the le.ral tenders now
lying in their vaults andt take them to
the t reasury for redempt ion . the
United States would be bankrupted in
an hour, the credit of the nation ru
ined.
If one were seeking for a positive
proof that our gold-money system is
not only wrong but entirely untenable
and dangerous as well. no better evi
dence could be found than the state
ment of this bullionist organ, so far as
it deals with facts. It is only too true
that a clique of half a dozen men can
at this moment command enough of
our inflated, convertible currency to
enable them to force this nation into
I nominal bahkruptcy at will: and if it
were true that "tthe credit of the United
States rests upon gohll.' this would he
done and the little remnant of that
metal now remaining in our vaults
would disappear like mist. lint the
truth is that our gold balance has little
-almost nothing-to do with our na
tional credit; while to force a suspen
sion of specie payments now would kill
the power of gold forever in this coun
try. It would be a blessing if this
very thing would happen; but the
money kings are as wise as they are
crafty, and that reserve will not be al
lowed to suffer further reduction
more 's the pity.
Now, the real purpose of this sort of
financial fol-de-rol is to frighten the
uninitiated into the belief that in order
to maintain a "sound" and "honest"
currency we must borrow gold from
the gold-hoarders, which gold they
may again wrest from the treasury by
the presentation of legal tenders for
redemption, while at the sametime the
nation will be still further mortgaged,
body and soul, to the clique of opera
tors, foreign and domestic, who even
now are able to threaten the nation
with dishonor unless it shall continue
to increase its already insupportable
load of utterly unnecessary gold obli
Rations.-William Penn, Jr., in Blue
I and Gray.
DEMOCRATIC SUB-TREASURY.
The Only Difference Is In the Rate of Inter
eot on Money Advanceed.
The sub-treasury plan of the alliance
has been ridiculed without cessation
by all the howlers and ward heelers of
the g. o. p. in Texas and out of it; hence
it is a surprise to us to find that the
very plan itself has been adopted by
the money kings of the democratic
party right here in Dallas. As proof
we callattention to the following hand
bill which is posted all over the coun
try. Read it and see how near it comes
to the alliance sub-treasury. The only
difference observable is in the rate of
Interest charged - -"easonable inter
est"-about 2 per cent. per month, in
stead of 2 per cent. per annum, as de
manded by the alliance plan:
"Grain Storage.-The Blank elevr
tor will be used during the present
grain season entirely as a public stor
age elevator. Its capacity is 1,000,000
bushels. It is now in the hands of a
bonded receiver, appointed by the
United States court I have arranged
with the City national bank to furnish
all money necessary to pay freights,
and, it desired, the owners of grain
stored in this elevator can, at a reason
able interest, secure an advance of 75
per cent of the grain stored."-South

This financier rightly arnrus I hat sil
ver coinage at Washingtonu w\ucilid not
provide the needed cl:lsti.·ity. the freet
and sutlicient expansion of the cur
rency n'e(ede, "'in f:arminq states at
harvest time, for example." So he
would give to the Ieanks in the rural
districts power to issue lank notes and
collect interest on their cewn tdebts, on
bank paper notes that would cost theum
not to exceed a cent a hundred, a
scheme to force the people to pay them
from ten to thirty-six per cent. on the
face of paper that cost them only one
per cent of its face ---which would be
a profit of 1.000 to 3.10c per cent. on
the cost of such capital.
If the paper currency can be fur
nished the banks at one per cent..it can
be furnished direct to the borrowers
certainly at a labor cost of not to ex
ceed two per cent. And if the currency
needs to be made elastic, as the bank
ers and popnlists azree. let us have it
made elbtstic not by wildcat bank is
sues. but by means of ,varehoused se
curities and manufactured necessities
through government banks coclducted
by servants of the people. working for
a reasonable salary, as plenty of capa
ble, well qualified men will ie willing
to work and furnish bonds besides.
A new banking systen must soon be
provided to take the place of the pres
ent system based on United States
bonds Let it be. then, government
banks and banking providing currenev
at cost, such as our party proposes.
With government banks, bIelo, inor to,
the people, issuing on ample security
legal tender currency at cost. the usury
or interest drains will be cut off. and
the money so lost will remain in the
hands of the wealth-producint class
and furnish them the means to buy
back as much wealth out of the mar
ket as their labor pours into, it. sie e;
tablishing the necessary equilibrium
between supply and demand.
And, take notice, this equilibrium is
what is necessary to prevent the peri
odid market gluts, commercial stagna
tion, conrtraction of credits and the en
forced idleness and distress of destitute
millions. Government banks in each
county conducted by the electedl and
bonded financial representatises of the
people, providing upon ample secucrity
currency at cost for the needs of eachl
locality, would, with supplementary
land legislation, restore justice, har
mony and lasting prosperity to thee in
dustrial and commercial worl.l.--Lin
