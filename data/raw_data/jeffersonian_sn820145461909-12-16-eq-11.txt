ELBERT COUNTY, GA.: The
Jeffersonians of upper Elbert county
are requested to meet at Deep
Creek Academy December 27th, at
2 P. M., to organize.
CLUB NO. 11, CORNELIA, GA.
According to appointment the
meeting was held in the College Au
ditorium, Cornelia, Ga., December
10, 1909, at 7:30 P. M., for the pur
pose of organizing a Jeffersonian
Club. The meeting was called to
order by Hon. C. W. Grant, who
made a very interesting address
along the line of reform, the need of
reform and reform measures in gen
eral. During his address Mr. Grant
gave us a very striking illustration
of how indifference has worked and
is working toward the overthrow of
the freedom for which our forefath
ers gave their fortunes and conse
crated their lives; the freedom
which cost the lifeblood of the no
blest heroes that America has ever
produced. He compared this indif
ference to two large fishes swimming
along in close association. One of
them is somewhat larger than the
other. The larger one is careful not
to molest the other one, btit is all
the time devouring great numbers of
the small fish about him. His com
panion makes no effort to protect the
small fish, and thinks that just so
long as he lets him alone everything
is all right and well with him. But
bye and bye the larger fish has
grown so large and powerful that he
is able to tackle his companion, and
with a mighty scoop he gulps him
down and is left complete master of
all his surroundings. Mr. Grant said
that while we might not feel that
there was any immediate danger to
us individually, that while we might
think that we “stood in” with the
favored, still we must be ever on our
guard of the liberties that we so
much love or there would come a
time when the privileged would for
get that we had stood aside and
watched with indifference, while they
destroyed those about us; by that
indifference making that destruc
tion possible, or we would ourselves
be destroyed by the same mighty
powers. Mr. Grant advocated the
education of the masses as the one
great solution of all the troubles of
our body politic, and said, by infer
ence if not in words, that if we con
tinued in ignorance we might expect
to find ourselves, sooner or later,
complete industrial and political
slaves.
Mr. Grant closed his address by in
troducing Hon. J. J. Brown, of Bow
man, Ga., who in a most earnest and
delightful manner told us about the
great principles of the immortal Jes-
Mr. Watson’s purpose is to save
the Farmers’ Union from certain
traitors WHO ARE STEERING IT
TOWARD THE ROCKS. The organ
ization itself, and the honest men
who are members of it, have no truer
friend than The Jeffersonian.
Olu Jeffersonian
ferson; the same Jeffersonian prin
ciples as advocated by the Jefferson
ian Clubs, and how these clubs were
being organized to disseminate the
great principles of democratic gov
ernment as expounded and taught by
Jefferson, and how the Jeffersonian
Club proposed to educate the great
masses of voters, how to cast their
votes intelligently, by systematically
studying and discussing all questions
of interest to them.
In this brief summary of Mr.
Brown’s address I have not hardly
begun to give you any idea of the
many good things that he had to tell
us, but as space is limited I am sure
Mr. Brown will pardon this brief out
line. We only regret that more were
not present to hear him.
Immediately after Mr. Brown’s ad
dress the Cornelia Jeffersonian Club
No. 11 was organized with the fol
lowing officers as the result of the
first election: Hon. C. W. Grant,
County School Commissioner, Presi
dent; D. A. Henderson, Member of
the Council of Cornelia, Vice-Presi
dent, and Ernest J. Kimsey, Secre
tary and Treasurer.
After the election of officers the
following committee was appointed
to draft by-laws for the club: Ernest
J. Kimsey, D. H. Brewer, T. M. Pat
terson, and D. A. Henderson.
The Club then adjourned until the
second Friday night in January at
7:30 P. M., the place of meeting to
be in Ernest J. Kimsey’s office.
LET THE FARMERS FROM EVERY
SECTION OF APPLING COUN
TY BE PRESENT.
I have a letter from Hon. J. J.
Brown, of Bowman, Ga., stating that
he will be present at a meeting to be
held in Baxley on Saturday, Decem
ber 17th, for the purpose of setting
forth the importance of organization
and to organize a Jeffersonian Club
for Appling county.
Mr. Brown is one of the strong
characters among the public men of
the State, and is popular as a Farm
ers’ Union organizer.
He is now aiding in the organiza
tion of Jeffersonian Clubs over this
State. The purpose of these Clubs is
to organize all believers in Jeffer
sonian Democracy for the purpose of
education along political lines, and
thereby enable us to vote with power
and intelligence.
The platform of the Club is that
adopted by a majority vote of the
members thereof, and therefore no
believer in the Jeffersonian princi
ples of government can object to
membership therein.
The rights of the common people
are infringed upon by class laws in
the National Government, therefore
let us lay aside party prejudice and
interest and make an organized ef
fort to correct the evils that oppress
us.
These Clubs are being organized in
every part of the Union and the peo
ple are ripe for organization.
Friday, December 17th, is the ac
cepted time to organize the people of
this county into an intelligent and
powerful political organization.
Will meet promptly at 2 o’clock
P. M. at the courthouse. So be on
time and hear a good speech.
Yours very truly,
CHAS. W. MIMS.
