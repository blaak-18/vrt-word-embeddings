WHY BE CONTENT.
Why be content? Are there no pas
tures new,
No fields of pleasure that your leis
ure craves?
Are there no deeper seas, no higher
waves
Than those o’er which your barque
has carried you?
Is there no fairer, farther reaching
view
Than this which you have bounded
with your glance?
Are there no unmarked pathways to
pursue
No unknown foes with whom to
break a lance?
Is there content for him who nobly
braves
The million byways leading up to
fame ?
Has satisfaction haloed hero’s graves
Or flashed the fire of genius into
flame?
What meed of honor, deem you, man’s
just due
Who sits complacent all life’s jour
ney through?
—Lurana W. Sheldon.
ABUSE OF THE PARDONING
POWER.
A remarkably large number of par
dons to convicts in the state’s penal
institutions have been granted by
Governor Smith during the past few
months. In these acts the executive
is governed largely by the reports of
the prison commission which, sitting
as a pardon commission, investigates
all applications for clemency and re
ports thereon to the governor. It may
possibly be that the creation of such
a pardon board is responsible for this
pardoning evil.
That it has become a great evil
is recognized by all. The pardons
and commutations are usually granted
in the more severe sentences, and con
sequently the beneficiaries are crimi
nals of the worst type. It is asserted
that ten per centfbf the murderers
in the state been
pardoned within the past ft w months,
and whether it is really quite so bad
as that or not, it is too well known
that such pardons have been and are
being issued in large numbers.
The effect of such misdirected clem
ency can only be bad. In murder
cases it has been for years a most
difficult matter to secure a conviction.
It is only in the most aggravated
cases of crime where a conviction can
be secured, and successfully run the
gauntlet of all the courts. When a
conviction has been secured in such
a case the sentence of the court
A Weekly Taper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
should stand. Executive clemency
should not interfere to cheat justice
by the exercise of the pardoning
power. It was never so intended, and
this abuse of it can only tend to
bring the law and justice into con
tempt.
The pardoning power is vested in
the governor to be used in a possi
ble case of unmerited conviction. It
is possible always, although it hap
pens very rarely, that a person may
be convicted who is really innocent
of the crime that is charged. In such
cases the pardoning- power offers the
only method of relief, since the courts
cannot be made retroactive. Except
in such cases, the pardoning power
should not be used and its use is
abuse.
It is very nice to be merciful. It
doubtless makes a governor feel good
to restore a poor convict to liberty
and perhaps to his family. It is a
trying ordeal to refuse the tearful
entreaties of the relatives and friends
of a convict that may be made. Any
generous hearted man would rather
grant such a petition than refuse it.
Yet they should be refused.
The majesty of the law is violated
every time a convict is pardoned, for
any other reason than unjust convic
tion. This wholesale pardoning of
convicts should be stopped.—Augusta
Herald.
THE TARIFF ON WHEAT.
Removal of the tariff on wheat
would not make a speculative cor
ner impossible. But the admission
free of duty of the product of the
Canadian wheat fields would make
the game of such men as Patten
more difficult. However, criticism
of the tariff on wheat does not rest
solely on the fact that it aids in the
<r cornering” process. The 25 cent
duty on wheat is far in excess of
the difference of cost of production
here and in foreign countries. Judged
by the President’s own standard, it
as an exorbitant duty. Moreover, it
is a tax on breadstuffs, an essential
of life. It is the quid pro quo given
to the farmer to secure his accep
tance of a tax on the products of
protected manufactories which he
buys. But it is a tax on every per
son in the country. Moreover, the
Aldrich bill provides for a 20 per
cent increase in this tax. Other legis
lation should be devised to prevent
gambling on public exchanges, but
good purpose will be served if the
Patten “corner” calls attention to
the iniquity of the tariff on wheat.—

SILLY SIGHTSEERS.
Is this country losing its Demo
cratic ideals? We are moved to ask
this question by the reports from
Washington which indicate that it is
almost impossible for President Taft
to attend church on Sunday with
out being almost mobbed by curious
t' ongs of sight-seers on the streets
national capital. On Easter
m great concourse of people
who •‘d outside of St. John's
church, Mr. Taft attended ser
vice with practically com-
pelled Mr. r l<, & top and hold an
open air recepu before he could
return to the White House. We have
always been ready to ridicule the
English who make fools of themselves
over their royal family, standing on
the streets for hours to see its mem
bers pass by and cheering themselves
hoarse on such occasions, but if we
are not careful we will give the Brit
ish press an opportunity to indulge
in no end of sarcasm at our expense.
Moreover, such conduct is un-Ameri
can and un-Democratic and there
seems to be little excuse for intrud
ing to such an extent on the privacy
which even the President ought to
be permitted to enjoy one day of the
week.— Magdalena. New Mexico,

GRUMBLERS AND VOTERS.
Enough chicanery has been brought
to light in connection with the Payne
tariff bill to blast the reputation of
every congressman who has had any
thing to do with it—tis such reputa
tions had not been blasted sufficiently
already. Yet what effect will it have?
The American people are prone to
forget such things. Having their
remedy at the ballot box they will
still vote for their party friends.
Democratic districts will go Demo
cratic and Republican districts will
go Republican. That’s just what will
happen, except in a very few dis
tricts where local causes change the
result.

This is the knife which the Jeffersonians are
offering as apremium for new subscriptions
to the magazine or the weekly. It’s a beauty.
This is what makes an indepen
dent voter and thinker sore. People
who shriek against injustice go to
the polls and decide to perpetuate it,
when if they were willing to set par
tizanship aside and look only to the
good of the people they could over
turn any existing order of things at
the first effort.
If the tariff bill finally works in
justice and hardship on any consid
erable number of the people—if the
cost of many necessaries is raised in
stead of lowered —voters will grum
ble about it, but that’s all. They al
ways have done so and they always
will do so as long as there is any
good old party, Republican or Demo
cratic to vote for.—Meigs Review.
CANNIBAL JAPS.
Young Lieutenant Marlinspike’s
bathing suit revealed on his right arm
an Uncle Sam and on his left a pea
cock, while around his neck a gleam
ing serpent was coiled, the mouth
holding its tail.
“This is Japanese tattooing,” the
lieutenant said proudly. “Nagasaki
work. I was under the needle nine
teen hours in all. My two tattooers
drank quite a pint of my blood.
“Jap tattooers are all blood drink
ers. They like it. They get to like
it in the end as you or I like to
bacco.
“You see, as they work tlhe blood
wells forth. It flows over the design,
and then, very carefully, without
smearing the wet ink, they lick the
blood up delicately with the tongue.
Every Jap tattooer as he picks and
picks away at you bends down every
few’ minutes and licks the little rising
tide of blood away.
“If he is a seasoned tattooer he
swallows the blood. He likes it, he
says.”—New Orleans Times-Demo
crat.
