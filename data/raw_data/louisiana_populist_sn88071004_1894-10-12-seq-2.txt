The Georgia Election.
For some c~;ose or another the
palrela have ceased to give us any1
tfurther results of the Georgia elec
ionl. The Democratic papers first
clatimed the State by about 30,000i
mnlosriy, but ftllnr ui admitted that
it was nearnr 7,000 than it was.
even 10,000. Since this time w-e
have failed to hear anlything more
about it. The Democratic pateCrs
also claim the election by the black
belt vote. This shows conclusive
ly that in Alabanma and Georgia
the Democrats have nothing to de
Ileid up1n but the negro vote, and
another remarkable fact the nlegro
Ihas gone to voting solidly for white
Iu pl'ellacy.
lion. Thos. E. Watson says there
was untold frlaUl ill the election,
l;ut iotwithstatndingi this failt tile
Populists have reduced the Demuo
cratic vote from 73,000 :ajority in
1892 to 7,000 iu 1804. This is a
good showiig and points to the
fact that this country is fast going
iinto the hands of the people.
The )emocrats made at tremen
dottas fight employing any amount
of Imodle, Thei Popxlists claim
the State by a majority of 7,a500
which no doubt is correct.
Democratic Party Not in Favor
of Free Colna&e.
The free and unlimited eoinage of tl- I
rer i a popaliastie idea and hLsa nosplace
in any Demtratic platform. It is equal
ly as obenrd uas the asbtreeary ides, the
gpeleaack ides, the opposition to nation

of railrendi and telegraphs. None of
these absurd vagaries can find place ht
any g~enine ltucarratic platform. They

,urpose of deeiving the unthinking mud

betwreen the doctrines of Democracey and

The above takes from the Demo

dut to convince any thianking man
that the Democratic party is not
i favor of the free coinage of sil
er, in fact, it has never so declar
ed, atwithstanding some of our
oautrty jourema preteud to hold
to that view, despite the over
whdaiua evidence against it. The

,"'None of these aIbsurd vagarice
can find place in any" genuiine 1m
r ocratic platforn." There is no
doubt in our mind that this D)emo
Sratic organ speaks from authority
r. from, and dictation by the Demo
cratic bosses at national headquar
w ters. It is nothing short of an of
-' ficial notice' to those would be free
silverites s.eeking to delude the peo
i pie to get their votes, not to go
n so far in these pretenses as not to
i bei able to slide bawk into rank., af
ter they get the offites.
S T[his as-tnmts for another fact.
W and that is that so many I)emocrats
are running for congress without
rr any expressed platform of princi
ples. If the D)cmocratic party
had intend led to keep faith with the
people -of the Fourth Congression
al District they would have placed
their candidate upon a platform
containing an absolute free silver
plank, but this they have not done.
r. There is no expression whatever
from the l)emobratic party of this
district by any platform whatso
ever, that pledges them as a part3
! to the free and unlimited coinage
of silver. Now readers, if you
are fighting national banks, and if
Syou want free silver and green
backs, vote the People's party tick
et, it is the only party that is
pledged to these things.
Mr. Bailey is our candidate on
that platform, now if you are real
ly in earnest vote for him.
e The Bond Issue Is Coming.
The receipts at the United States
Treasury during the quarter end
iig October 1st, 1891, were *79,
t 379,414, and the expenditures were
$98,459,129, leaving a clear deti
ciency of $19,079,715. This means
that the people will have another
issue of bonds to pay interest up
on.
Out With the Party Lash Al
i ready.
1 It is widely stated and generally be
lieved that the Populist] largely parti
cipated in the recent Democratic pri
e maries, If such be the case, the only
inference to be drawn is that they have
returned to their first love, as the riles
governing the primary explicitly stated
that none but known white Democrat;
should participate in the election, and if
i so those voting at the primary are honor
bound to support the nominee. Popu
lism and Democracy are entirely dis
I tinet faiths and no man can believe in
1fboth.
The above is from the Shreve

have already said about the party

In speaking of a Populist meet

Bailey and Vincent spoke, the

I Mr. Bailey was the first speaker, and
made a very favorable imnprmio. IHe
is a Iant talker, and evidently thor

adepted into law the only remedy for

Why Don't They "?
)Durinr 'hIe.l an i' fir-t I t m ilte
1 )emocrats h:ad control of the
house. 'Their 'excuse then for not
enacting some measures of relief,
was that the Republican ,enate was
in the way. That it would not
permit the passaºe of such meas
ures as the people needed and de
manded. The failure to do any
thing again put the Republicans in
powier in ls. Ilarri.on was
elected. In 1s't a political "l'ind
slide" gave the Democrats
the house by 14s nmjority.
Again their cry was they
had no "chance" t, do anything.
They cavorted around alout how
quick they would give the people
free silver if they only had the
chance. 'They could hardly keep
their shirts on when they talked
about the "robber tariff." If they
only had "a chance" they would
knock out thu trust. and throttle
the greedy corporations. They
fairly foamed at the mouth against
the eneroachments of capital on
the rights of labor. They swore
eternal friendship to the men who
made their living "in the sweat of
their faces."
Then came the election of I 892.
The people trusted in the promises
of the D)emocratic leaders. They
gave the Democratic party com
plete control of every department
ot government. We held our
breath. Now all these mighty
promises would be fulfilled. We
imagined the trusts quaked before'
this nmighty power. We could see
in our imagination the corporations
cowering before it. We thought
we saw justice putting on a new
dress and brightening up her scales.
Now labor was to be enthroned and
capital taught to know its hounds.
But lo, what bitter disappoint
ment!
Justice appears in her same old
dirty garb.
She has the game old "loaded"
scales.
Cleveland appoints a corpora
tion lawyer to prosecute the corpo
rations and trusts. His cabinet is
made up of lawyers, most of whom
represent corporations. Then fol
lows the recorl. The things they
said they would d:) they did not
do. The things they said that
ought not to be (lone they did.
Now, they are wringing their
hands and pleadling for more time
-for another "chance."
But 'the question arises: Why
did they not do something when
they had the chance ?
Why did they not remonetize
silver, as they said they would, in
stead of demonetizing it 3
Why did they not give us a real,
genuine reform tariff hill as they
promised ?
Why did they not wipe out the
trusts and the national banks?
Why, oh, why, did they not do
something to show their regard for
the people ?
They have lied.
They have deceived the people.
Shall we trust them again --Da
kota Ruralist.
Dying Out.

What has comer over the Courier

the free anmid unliamited coinage of

recently it has adopted the inter

attended. At theme meetings Prof.
Vincent illustrated his remarks

The Populists besieged them so
heavily with petitions in the mat
ter of building a courthouse, that
they have agreed to raise the as
sessment on fine-timberetl lands
instead of raising the rate of taxa
tion, to build a courthouse.
Now 9-tenths of this land in
Winn is owned by non-resident
speculators, and hence Winn is to
have a splendid brick courthouse.
without raising the taxes of a sin
gle resident, except one that owns
this kind of land. The People's
party and the Alliance before it,
contendted for this principie for
years, and now that the police ju

mended for it.

(.r.nt parish *-hool board met Satnr
day. October 6th. Proceedings of asme
will be sent next issune, we failed to sc
cure s:mme this week, for the following
reasoll :
The report of the grand jury relative
to the action of the parish superintend
ant was read as follows :
We have examined the parish treasur
er's books, and find same correct. We
consider the school fund a very sacred
one, and have made a very careful i~ves
tigation of same, and Aind our parish su
perintendent's salary amply suflcieuat for
his services, and find that the law allows
him actual expenses while away in the
interest of the schools; and find further
that he draws the patent price of $50 to
cover expenses to attend the superin
tendent's annual convention. For in
stance, he draws $50 for his expenses to
Lake Charles, and a like amount to
Natchitoches. We believe that the trips
can be made for a great deal less money.
We find that he has been paid the sunn of
202 to cover the expenses of four trips
to these conventions, and we are eertain
that a prudent man could have made the
trips for about one-third of the amount
drawn. Too much care and judgment
can not be used by the president in draw
ing his warrants, and we suggest that
an expense account be presented before
drawing his warrants. We also saug
gest that the school board endeavor to
secure the services of competent exam
iners who will discharge this duty free
of cost
This.extract was taken from the re
port of the grand jury sitting at the 8ep
tember court, 1894. Judge W. L. Rich
ardson, the parish Superiutenudent wha
is also ex-ollicio a member of the .ehool
board, and secretary of the school beard,
waa called upon for his resignation.
He agreed to resign, but when the board
was about to adjourn, he declined todo so,
and was removed. This action on the
part of the secretary enaused the board to
adjourn amid some excitement, and no
minautes were regularly recorded. The
board adjourned until Saturday, Octo
ber 13th, to elect a new ofcial.

On Monday moriining. the 8th inst.,
about 5 o'clock, a shadow oif gloom was
cast over our town and comununity Iiv
the sad news of the death of Mrs. W. O.
Harrison. It is indeed sad ; sad to
chronicle the death of this gol lady.
It again reminds us that death is no
respecter of per of persons, and we can otrly
humbly bow to the will of our Creator
and pray, His will le done We deeply
sympathize with the bereaved family
and relatives, and commend them to the
blessed Savior, in whom Mrs. Harrison
has long since put her trust, as their
guide and comfort through this life, and
hope there will be a happy reunion of
these people where there will be no
more sickness, no sorrow, no pain. no
death.

Mrs. Myers, of our town, has taken a

High School, with a good attendance.
This new branch of study in our school
should be given all the patronage possi

We are still without a music teacher
for our school. Can't the patrons of
this department bestir themselves and
work tip an interest sufllcient for the
school board to employ a teacher?
The new election law requires three
supervisors of election for each parish.
In this parish the Clerk of Court has ap

EDITOR POPULIST :
If you will allow me space in your
valuable paper, I will write you from
this part of the country. Prof. . Vin
cent made us an excellent speech yes
terday. I think he opened the eyes of
the people and put them to thinking.
All we. need is enough like Prof. Vin
cent. Mr. Bailey was not present, as he
was expected. But I think Prof. Vin
cent is sufficient to convince anybody
that the Democrats are not going to do
anything in behalf of the people. He
gave the Democrats a rousing reception.
The Professor made us a fine speech.
Would be glad to hear one like it every
week. I think the people had better
come out to the polls and try the Peo
pIe's party. They have tried the Demo
crats long enough to be convinced thatI
they are not going to do anything for
the poor man. They should come out
and vote the People's party ticket and
stay with it and see that they get a fair
count. As long as you vote and go
home and leave the ballot box in the
enemy's hands you may expect to be
counted out Success to the Por str.

Soelal Gatherlng.
Last Saturday evening is long to
be remembered by those who shar
ed the kind hospitality of Mrs.
Beatrice Tessier and her two esti
mable daughters, Misses Lucile'
and Elmina, who kindly entertainel
their guests at their beautiful hoem
on Cane river, on the occasion of a
delightful social getherin2.
At an early hour in the evening
the guests began to arrive and
continued until some forty of fifty
of the charming bells and hand
some beaux had arrived, when they'
began to trip the fantastic toe in a
style that would have put Terpsi
chore himself in envy of their suc
cess. Sweet strains of music ie
ing dispensed by the Natchitoches
string band. The enjoyment of
those present was only interrupted
by refreshments, which were dis
pensed by the kind hostess. All en
joyed themselves to their hearts
content, until a late hour in the
night, and retired to their homes,
where no doubt, their thoughts in
dream-land continued to dwell upon
the pleasant evening which is to
be long remembered by those pros

OBITUARY.
With deep regret and sorrowful hearts
are we again reminded of that irrevoca
ble decree of the Great King, "Dt
thou art and unto dust thou shalt re
turn," by the sudden death of our much
esteemed young friend, Mas GRaAclE
HALE.
The subject of this sketch was a native
of (;rant parish, La., and the youngest
daughter of Rev. J. C. Hale and wife,
and died at her native home at the early
I age of eighteen. One of her many dis
tinguishing characteristics was her strict
adherence to Christian duty. She swemn
ed ever ready to show forth to the world
her unflinching faith by her daily wa'k
and untiring kindness to her momy
friends.
She became a member of the Baptist
chaurch at quite a tender age, and there
remaided a model Christian, unswerv
ing in her determination for good, till
the angel of Death hbade her spread he'
downey wings for a flight across the cold,
dark stream, into the realms of eternal
bliss, to join with her loved ones who
have gone before.
While it is with much grief and regret
that we must say "Farewell" to our
young friend, it is indeed a con'soling
thought for us to have that hlescd as
surance that another bright jewel has
been added to the blood-washed thro:ng
in our celestial home. Though w.
would not call her hack, let us strive tJ
meet ber there.
"'S he i waiting, ever waiting.
For the friends she loved the bet,
And she'll gladly hall their coming
To the mansions of the blesat
"One by one the Lord will call us,
As our labor here is done ;
And then as we cross the river.
We may meet her one by one."
