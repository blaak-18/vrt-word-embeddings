CLEVELAND AND THE NEGRO.
The clippings following may be pe
rused with interest:
"The speech made by Grover Cleve
land in New York the other day on the
negro problem was both sensible and
timely. It shows that Mr. Cleveland
knows more about the negro than most
Northern people do, and his speech is
appreciated by both races in the South.
The speaker said the Southern people
are the best friends the negro has and
that they are better qualified to settle
the issues involved than the Northern
people, but his sentiments will not re
ceive general endorsement."-Mans
field Journal.
"Grover Cleveland has recently had
his say on the race question, and a very
good say it was, too. But, if our mem
ory is not at fault, his conduct to
wards Douglass and Bruce, of Missis
sippi, during his second administration
were not much more acceptable to the
people of the South than the antics of
Teddy Rooevel."--Homer Guardian
Journal.
One reason why Cleveland was not
publicly criticised by Democrats as
Roosevelt is being condemned was be
cause he was the Kepresentative of
Democrats who were restrained, some
what in the spirit which governs when
something disagreeable has occurred in
the family circle. In his speech Mr.
Cleveland advanced no suggestion for
the betterment of present conditions,
and he reiterated in high-sounding
phrases the views expressed in more
simple words of a problem well under
stood throughout the South and by
many people in the North as well, dnd
which will settle itself if the negro is
let alone. While the Caucasian is un
compromisingly Democratic and stands
unflinchingly for the rule of intelligence
aid white supremacy, it will subscribe
to the shrine of no man, even if it be
Grover Cleveland, and while his good
words for the South, to whom he must
ever be indebted for the honors on. him
conferred, are appreciated, we, as the
Guardian-Journal, have in memory his
conduct towards Bruce of lississippi
and Fred Douglas of the District of
Columbia (whose wife was white) and
who, although negroes, on more than
one occasion, received not only the
"official" but the social recognition
which: all Southern n men disapprove
radically. -
WHY DISCREDIT BRYAN.
Co. W. J. Bryan has notified his New
York friends that he will be in the East
.in Myt and deliver a series of addresses
on political issues. He no doubt will
take especial pains- to speak against
what he .ealls the reorganization Of the
Demedtatic party. lIt other words he

the Dtncracy, especially one puiblished
beyond the A~~uence. of the trusts and

persist in their abuses and ridicule of
Mr. Bryan and the extolling of Mr.
Cleveland? A fact is a fact, and it is a
fact that Bryan -was loyal to the party
while Cleveland sulked and aided and
abetted in the election of McKinley. Is
not Cleveland, then, a dese-ter? Why,
then, should loyal men discredit a leader
who has been tried and true for one who
when tried, rebelled defiantly, joined the
enemy, and assumed to be bigger and
greater than the party who had honored
him and made him a President of the
United States?
A Chicago man shot and fatally in
jured a constable who came - to arrest
him, and then handing the officer his
revolver announced that he would sur
render. This is what is technically
known as rubbing it in.-New Orleans
States.
Peculiar, rather! If the constable had
been ''-to-date" with his handy and
ready pistol he would have shot. and

The Commoner says: "The Cincin
nati Enquirer seems to resent the cele
bratin cf Jefferson's hirthday. It
might offer a prize to the person who
will gues. nearest to the number of
years it will require to suppress all
mention of Jefferson's principles."
The Morehouse Clarion says: "The
Monroe News is still worrying about
how the Democrats of this State are go
ing to nominate their officers and is pre
dicting all kinds of dire things if they
don't do as it says and nominate by
white primaries. Don't trouble your
soul, brother. The Democrats, at the
proper time, will do the right thing and
that which will redound to the beat in
terests of the State and people, whether
â€¢me and Caffery' like it or not. Just 'hold
you rhorses' a little while longer."
The sanity of the negro leader of the
Indiana ghouls is now questioned. We
lon't know how negroes grow up in that
country, but no negro in this country
while in possession of his right mind
can be induced to enter a graveyard at
night.-Memphis News.
Too true, a right minded negro shuns
a graveyard at night.-Richland Beacon
News.
And a "right minded"' negro would
feel joyful resting on the bosom of Old
Nick rather than to listen to a. groan or
stand and gaze at a walking ghost.
Five Cents' Worth of Sermon.
An amusing story is told of the Rev.
H. S. Thrall, one of the pioneers of
Methodism in Texas. In company with
a number of itinerants who were on
their way to conference Dr. Thrall
stopped to spend the night with an old
farmer. It was the custom then to set
tle the bill at night, so that they might
rise about 3 o'clock in the morning and
ride a good way before breakfast and
lie by in the heat of the day. Dr.
Thrall, acting as spokesman of the par
ty, said to the old farmer after supper:
"We are a company of Methodist
preachers going to conference. If you
will get the family together, we will
have prayers with you." After pray
ers one by one settled his bill. Dr.
Thrall's turn came, and he asked for
his bill. The old farmer replied, "Well,
pa'son, I charged the rest 25 cents;
but, bein' as you prayed for us so good,
I won't charge you but 20 cents." The
brethren had the laugh on Dr. Thrall.

en's Southwest ,oard of Missions

Friday night. The jurisdiction of this
body covers Missouri, aKnsas, Texas.

Emerson's Lecture Fee.
George Francis Train tells this story
of Mr. Emerson's lecturing. It shows.
by comparing ."$5 and four quarts of
oats"' with $500, ,how much the public
was .willing to pay for the lecturer's
fame.
Th. e lecture night was always a great
everit in Waltham. One day a mart
came to me and said., "Here is a re
nmhrl~ible letter." He read it to me.
aid it was as follows:
T'o the Library;Committee, Waltham:
"I will come to lecture for $5 for myself.
bitt ask you for four quarts of oats for
Mhy horse,
RALPH WALDO EMERSON.
The lecture that Mr. Emerson de
livered for,us boys of the library com
mittee in Waltham was entitled "Na
tore." We paid him $5 and four quarts
of oats for it. He delivered it many
times afterward, when his name was
on every lip in the civilized world, and
he reeeived fromi $150 to $500 for each
delivery. He was just as great then in
that hdur in the little old town of Wal
than. It was the same lecture with
the same exquisite thought and mar
velous wisdom, but it took years for
the world to recognize the greatness
and the beauty. and the wisdom of him
and to value them at their higher
worth.
Child Study.
The time at which a child should be
gin to study is a vexed question of ed
neation, and one which shows no signs
of being settled. The superintendent
of the Quincy (Mass.) schools raised
the question a few days since and as
serted that a child should not be sent
to school until it was seven. Other
educators, however, do not agree with
him. President Eliot of Harvard
thinks the little girl or boy should en
ter the kindergarten at four, and the
superintendent of the Boston schools,
Edwin P. Seaver, suggests five as a
suitable age at which to begin the
school life.. The superintendent of the
Cambridge schools, Frank Cogswell,
thinks that even three is not too early
for the kindergarten.
J-ew Pseuatde at Bible Celebfatioi.

e- BIG PICTURE ADS.
It Painting Them Requires Little Skfal,
[o but Implicit Obedience.
of When a man walking along the side
ll walk sees another man suspended fifty
feet above him painting a nostril six
feet long or an eyelash five feet long.
[e the chances are ten to one that the
pedestrian will stop a moment to won
it der how the painter, with his face so
0- close to the picture, can get the exact
e- proportions of the human face, says
y the New York Times. If any one
ty should tell the spectator that never in
tr his life until today had the man up
there tried to paint a human face, the
information would be received with a
laugh of scorn. Yet it is no uncommon
thing for an ordinary sign painter to
hr be employed to paint a picture of Jim
Id Dumps or William Pen' or any other
face used for advertising purposes.
Why is this?' Simply because it is
te merely a matter of measurements and
i accuracy and requires no artist's skill.
The pedestrian on the pavement doesn't
see it, but the whole wall on which the
Y picture is being painted is laid off into
d a number of squares, made by inter
it secting chalk lines. The cxa(,t slpot ill
each of these lines where tile tip of the
is nose or the toe of the foot shall be is
as fixed as is the day for the next
eclipse of the sun.
A visitor asked the head designer in
d an outdoor advertising firm if it wasn't
d hard to get men skillful enough to
r paint these exaggerated pictures.
"The other day." replied the design
er, "I got a man who had never painted
anything but letters in his life to put
a face twenty feet high on a wall, and
he did it as well as it could be done."
Then lie showed how the only part
that took any skill was done in his
own office. First he or some other de
signer drew a small picture, about
quarter life size, on a piece of square
cardboard. When this was done, the
piece of cardbard was divided by pen
cil lines into sixty-four squares, so that
its form was just like that of a checker
board. This was given to a painter,
and it was told him that each square
on the paper meant one fifteen feet
square on the wall.
Then it was easy for the painter to
lay off with colored chalk squares of
the required size on the wall. When
he began to paint, he took the design
er's drawing with him. There were
explicit directions as to colors and the
kinds of brushes to be used. Then it
was only a matter of proportion. If
the nose occupied half a square on the
paper, it occupied half the correspond
Ing square on the wall, and if the but
ton of the coat was at the intersection
of two pencil lines, It must be at the
same intersection of the chalk lines.
The designer said that it was a very
common occurrence for him to send
one man to finish, a picture that an
other man had begun. Once he had
three men painting the same figure,
taking turn about until the job was
complete.
"It's purely mechanical." he said. "If
we catch a man using his own ideas or
trying to display any originality, we
get rid of him immediately. -Suppose
a man took a notion into his head to 1
try a few fancy strokes and we had to
put another man at it the next day. 1
Wouldn't that picture be a pretty
messF?"
The average painter of large pictures
earns about $30 a week. A larger sal
ary is very rare. It is never hard to
get the man you want, the designer
says, because anybody that is used to
a paint brush and' can make measure
ments is able to do the work.
Facts About the Bible.
Twenty-eight huge volumes of the
British museum catalogue contain noth
big but titles of different editions of
the Bible and commentaries ,upon it.
Two Bible societies, .one in Laudon,
one in New York, have printed 250,
000,000 copies of the whole book or
part of it in a hundred years. There
are similar societies in other cities and
countries, and many private firms have
printed Bibles for commercial profit.
But for the work of these societies
we might 'never dream that more than
363 languages or dialects are spoken
and read in the world. The London
society alone has used that number.
Only about one-third of all the Bibles
printed in London are in English. In
the east dialects are especially numer
ous. Dr. Riggs, the missionary, has
heard twenty different lingoes in one
crossing of the footbridge over the
Golden Horn at Constantinople.
For Armenians alone the Bible must
be printed in various fashions - Ar
menian in Turkish script, Armenian in
Greek script. Armenian in what is
called the Armenian character, besides
that for Armenians who no longer
speak their own language.
The Limit of Big Ships.
By passing onward from larger size
to larger ,ize the transatlantic ship
eompaniesthave finally reached what is
deemed by many observers to be the
limit in ship expansion. In the new
ship of the White Star line, the Cedric
-which made it!- first appearance in
New York harbor in the latter part of
February ice clad and ponderous. after
a maiden voyage from England-a ca%(
pacity is afforded for over 2,600 pas
sengers in addition to a crew of 335.
The decks of the vessel rise above the
water more or less like the stories of a
hotel, and newspaper artists, seeking
for some means of conveying an ade
quate impression of the ship's size.
have drawn it to scale with the great
Flatiron building in New York, with
a result not flattering to the building.
Increasing the size and improving the
accommodating capacity of the ocean
steamships seem to have been fallen
back upon by the various companies
asThe only method of competition now
that the ship combines have become so

NOT TO EXHIB!T
Eighteen Large 'German Firm- l efuse to
Take Part in FIxp: ltion,
New York, April 3..-German man
ufacturers and exporters cables the
Berlin correspondent of the Herald
that they propose to boycott the St.
Louis exposition. Out of eighteen
large firms all allied to the Essen
chamber of commerce all but one have
resolved to refrain from exhibiting,
and a report just received from So
lingen announces that all manufactur
ers and all industrial firms belonging
to the chamber of commerce of that
city have resolved unanimously not
to exhibit.
Only a few weeks ago a German pub
lishing house agreed to boycott the St.
Louis exposition because of defective
copyright laws and wholesale transla
tion of German publications in the
United States, equivalent to literary
piracy.
The firm of Krupp, of Essen, which
was the largest German exhibitor at
Chicago, obstinately refuses to ex
hibit at St. Louis. Similar resolutions
have been carried by numerous cham
bers of commerce, especially in the in
dustrial -region of the Rhine, West
phalia and Silesia.
In Saxony, it is learned, the feeling
against exhibiting at St. Louis is
acute.
