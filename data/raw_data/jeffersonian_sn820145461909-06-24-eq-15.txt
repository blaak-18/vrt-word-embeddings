bling den and fifteen men, some of
whom were of the best families.
There was a rush for the door and a
fight. But the culprits were permit
ted to escape.
Next morning there appeared in
large type in the Herald an article
which stood almost alone on a page
and whose chief sentence was this:
Last night at eleven thirty, there
were, in the rear room of the house
number ten East Green street, to
gether with such and such articles
which were there being employed in
gambling, the following persons:
And here appeared in larger type
yet, every one standing out alone,
the names of the fifteen men. The
article was signed boldly—“ Martin
P. Hodge.”
The storm that this pronouncement
evoked could scarce have been ex
ceeded. Three libel suits were begun
against Hodge and fought for months
in the courts. Martin won them all.
The sheriff was compelled to act;
some of the fifteen were punished,
some desperate characters fled. And
now, in the fourth year, with another
campaign coming on, the railroaders
and other working classes rose to
demand The Chump for mayor.
Hodge met the committees of these
men and said:
“I will run for mayor on this plat
form. The city shall condemn and
pull down every house on the Levee.
The men who have trafficked in this
scandal shall be prosecuted. The
county commissioners who were
bribed two years ago shall be pun
ished. This shall be a reform move
ment designed to change things.”
Hodge was nominated. In Octo
ber, the campaign being hotly fought,
he was walking down Green street
one night at ten o’clock, when some
one, on that very Levee which he was
determined to destroy, fired at him.
The bullet struck him in the back
and he fell.
The criminal was never found.
Martin was carried to his own room,
where he lay unconscious, but the
doctors had hopes for him.
Next day the town was horrified at
the news and many people sent flow
ers and other tokens to Hodge, which
bright things looked out of place in
the chumpy room.
At four o’clock, Keating being at
the head of the stairs, met Isabel
Hayden coming up. She looked
pained.
“I brought these violets for Mr.
Hodge, Mr. Keating,” she said, and
handed them to him. “If he is able
to hear, please tell him how sorry
my father and I are. What does the
doctor say?”
“He thinks he will live,” said
Robert.
“I’m glad,” she replied and went
down.
So when Martin became conscious
at sunset time, there were her violets.
She, having proceeded along the
square, came to the grocery store.
Everybody was of course interested
in Hodge now, and some people were
asking the boy to show them where
he had slept so long. They went
into the store and Isabel stood hesi
tating. She bit her lip a little; she
started away, then came back. Now
she went in and came to the hole
under the stairs.
“In there,” said the boy.
It was a tiny place; there was
nothing in it but an empty shelf.
Seven years! She sighed and went
