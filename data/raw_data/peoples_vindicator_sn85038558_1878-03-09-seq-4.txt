European News.
Replytog to the ai. - of the E,n
don Standard, which 'declared that
the sword would have to decide, un
less Russia mado concessions, the
AIgence Russe says the British govern
nent has declared that it would only
make war on behalf of British inter
oasts. Russia has respected and satis
fied these interests. Therefore, citlh
er the Standard. is misinformed or
England will act in opposition to her
formal declaration. As regards con
cessions, the European cabinets know
that Russia is resolved to maintain
the essential results of the war. She
will always show herself disposed to
accept every means of reconciling the
inviolability of this result, with the
interests of third parties, but threats
and military preparations are a had
way of attaining a peaceful under
standing.
The Vienna correspondent of the
Times says as regards the vote of cred
it a meeting of political clubs have
been repeatedly called to consider the
subject and then adjourned, showing
that those who desired to carry the
matter with a rush, are as yet far
from having the upper hand.
In the house of lords this evening
Lord I)erby, in reply to an enquiry,
said he had reason to believe the trea
ty of peace would he signed to-umor
row. Hle also said a rumor had reach
ed him from many quarters, whih lie
had hoped was true, that Russia had
abandoned her idea of the cession to
hie of the Turkish fleet.
The indications are that England
cannot now declare war against uens
sia. She has allowed the Tlt ks to he,
subjugated and must accept the result
as calmly and stoically as the Turks
coemn to.
Home Affairs.
Washington, I). (',
The house Pacific railroad commit
tee expect to report the Texas and
Northern Pacific bill for action in a
few days. Bloth will probably receive
early consideration. )Opponents of the
former are confident of ability to de
feat it. Mr. Blair, of New Hampshire
introduced a bill to-day authoriziing
the Southern Pacitic to extend to El
Paso, and if there be no eastern con
nection at that point in six years,
then to continue eastward along the
projected line of the Texas and Pa
cific; if the Southern Pacific is not
finished to El Paso in six years any
eastern line may extend west of the
Rio Grande and form a junction. The
bill grants no money or land; requires
connection with San Diego; pro late
with all connecting roads; prohibits
combination with other trans-conti
nental lines, and provides government
supervision of rates.
Proceedings in Congress unimpor
tant. About all the political speeches
which can be, have been made. And
dull, dreary routine is all we must
now expect.
The New Orleans collectorship is
still undecided. The president was
halting between Packard and iMcMil
lan until this morning, but Kellogg
has suddenly changed front and is now
for Steele. He told Evarts that the
appointment of Steele would be satis
factory and would harmonize all par
ties. As he was supposed to favor
Packard, this has created some sur
prise and comment. Ellis, Leonard
and other members of the Louisiana
delegation recommended Steele on
Saturday. McMillan is still strong.
It is impossible to tell what effect
this unexpected change will have.
Packard said this morning lie always
thought Kellogg was for him, but de
clines to say what he thinks of the
change. Gibson and Eustis are not
on record for anyone. Packard's
strength is the endorsement of twenty
.seven senators and one hundi ed mnm
hers of the house. Dat rall is said to
be in the field for coliectorship.
The Democrats in the Houso have
at lat becoma impine,e with the
opinion that somie ltn, hitle assur'ance
ought to be given Gov. Nicholls of
support from the Nat ;nal 1)enceracy
in hisefflorts to enfori thle I ;is i 'of
Louisiana, and a resolhtlion will be iin
troduced on Monday, iust ncling the
Judiciary Committee to intqliie andt
reportforthwith wihtlier ainy li;'siin

States.
This will develop the fact that the
retention of Anderson in office after
his conviction ofan infamous crime by
a jury is in violation of an old statute
and may accelerate Hayes in reiov
ing him. It is not believed that the
Republicans in the House will under
take to vote solidly against this reso
lution, and so it is likely to pass un
der a suspension of the rules.
The sudden and mysterious disap
pearance of Judge Leonard last Tues
day is accounted for to-day. He has
gone to (Havana to look after some
Florida negroes, alleged to have been
kidnapped, taken to Cuba and sold
into slavery. Why Judge Leonard
should have been selected for this dis
agreeable duty was not quite clear,
until it leaked out here from 'strictly
confidential sources that the trip to
Cuba was merely a blind, and that
Leonard's real destination is Louisia
na, where he is going incog., as it
were, in the capacity of envoy .extra
ordinary from Hayes and John Sher
man to negotiate with Gov. Nicholls
for a settlement of the Returning
Board cases.
Developments of great interest may
be expected to result from Leonard's
mission.
New Orleans, La.
O. Chopin, Alcus Scherk & Autry,
commission houses, and John I Adams
& Co., grocers, failed.
The Returning Board trials are not
attracting much attention at this mo
tment. Anderson's sentence promptly
squelched what pluck that remained
in the *crowd."
The Firemen's parade and Mlardi
Gras festivities of 5th and 5th inst.,
were grand displays. A large con
course of visitors from all parts of tile
Union was in attendance.
The Legislature adjourned on
Thursday March 7th.

Preventing Hog Cholera.
The diseases to nhich swinl al e
subject are mntut\. They ale, mIn)stl
all termed cholera. No matter what
the form may he, there is it great cry
for a cue. lHad \e not better tiul
out the cause anld reitlmolve it, or fiiidl a
plevlentive 'E Mist diseaes can he
tlaced to wolrnis, alid m titls ale
wOl'm.s iare cusedIt'i by hogs being

exclusively ol cornI', or tioi) imallny

not thriving tley )soon show it in
their hair. It looks dead and coarse,
and then you may look out for sone
malady. Hogs lutist be kept in clean
quart(es and be fed a val ieiLv of food
such as meets their wants, which can
he ascertained by any careful feeder.
Let the llan who feeds corn alone
think how long he could renmtain
healthy on just one single article' of
food. I have examined pigs that
have died with the thumps, and I
find their entrails tilled with long
white worms, thie outside beinug cov
ered with small uleets, and beneath
evely ulcer the wovrms' heads were
imbedded. I tried the fiollowing as a
pretentive frequently, and can re
cormimend it: I'urpentine mixed in
slop, as mllich at a ti tue as oull can
get your hogs to eat. Give it once
evert two or three weeks ; or if they
are atl'ected, give a teaspoonful of
turpentine in at small qtuantiy of lard
or sweet milk, andti it generally efiiects
a cure. G;ive on se e a day until
cured. I teed tny hogs salt, ashes,

ra.-William Aldridge in Rural World
What Can be I)oue by Reading.
Soime farliels aro inot contellt to
close their eyes to the value of ''book
fltriuing," as many ate pleased to
term the puiblishe'. expleriments and
p'iatice of their brethren. A 'ase
in point is given by a co resplonldelt
of tlhat sterling old joirnoal , the New
England Farmer : "The first imlpor
tanlt step I took, said he under its
dilectionl, was in the imatter of ftences.
I had been over int y fences in the
spring, patching here a spltatnd there
a spot, building so as to alppear well
buit alas t feeling that it \\ould not
withstand having a cow scratch
against it, or that snite strong wind
would lay it low. In the next issueo
of the Farmer appeared an ar ticle on
the importance of close, high and
substantial fences. It struck me
very forcibly, and I thought of my
poor sickly fences, and after rmlinia
ting further on the subject, resold ed
to have some fences on my place of
which I need not hbe ashamned; I
went to work and in ten days had a
set of good, strong fences, and at the
end of the season I saw it paitl. It
was the same in other matters, after
a year or two by following its sug
gestions I was enabled to turn to ac
count many things which I had be
fore allowed to go to waste. It as
sisted me wonderfully in the man
agement and feeding of my stock,
helped me greatly in the making of
omy butter and cheese, opened my
eyes to the great imlportance of warm
and more comfortable barns, and to
tihe making and using of manure; it
has given valuable aid in the matter
of pilowing and iharrowing, and, in
short, there are very few things iu
the doing of which I have not im
proved since 1 began its acquaintance.
I believe it has been the means, under
God, of securing to me a happy home,
for, considering the four years of bu
siness stagnation through which we
have ipassedl, without it I shoulh ntot
have been worth a dollalr."'
Controlling Ilorn Growth.
A correspondent of the Country
Gentleman, upon the subject of con
trolling horn growth, says:
"Some thirty years ago when a
boy on my father's farm I had a pair
ot calves given to me of which I was
very proud, as all boys usually are
of their steers. When they were
two yeors old, a born on one of them
became badly lopped, caused by an
injury. As they were perfect while
younger, I was very anxious to
straighten it, as they were twins and
very fine, and my method was, and
is, as follows: Scrape, or shave the
horn on the same side you wish to
turn it, nearly or quite to the quick.
I remember in that instance I start
ed the blood. Repeat the operation
some two or three times if necessary,
to be governed by the severity of the
case, and scrape the horn on the op
posite side just enough to give it a
health growth. The philosophy of it
is that by weakening the side in the
direction you wish to move the horn,
and by facilitating growth on the op.
posite side, the result, from natural
causes will be sure-that the strong
will overcome the weak. The horn
in question was raised a little higher
than the original, but not enough to
be noticeable. I believe this mode
of operating to be correct, and the
remedy infallible, as I have had oc
casion to see demonstrated many
times since.
Fattening Sheep.-The English feed
for fattening sheep consists of cotton
seed and turnips. They claim that
it will put on the most fat, it the
safest food, makes the best mutton at
a least cost, and produces the best
and strongest manure.
There is no better preservation of
eggs than linseed oil smeared over
the shells, or immersing them in oil
of lime.
The services of a novice upon a
well-ordered farm are worth less than
nothing, because he requires to be
shown how to do everything, which
is more trouble than doing it without
such help. It is customary that a
certain sum be paid as an equivalent
for the trouble of teaching a novice
in farming. Generally $3)0J a year
is charged, which covets board.
A clean poultry-house is indispen
sable, if the fowls are expected to be
healthy. It is a small job to scrape,
sweep and dust the door and remove
the droppings twice or three times a
week during feeding time. Thedrop.
pings should Dot be stored in the
pour y-house, but in a dry place in
barrels, and kept for use in the
spring.
