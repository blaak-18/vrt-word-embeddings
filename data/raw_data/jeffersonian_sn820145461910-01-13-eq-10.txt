OUR POST-CARD CLUB
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I have been
reading some nice letters in The Jef
fersonian from the children. Thought
I would write you a few lines, and
see if you would let me join your
Post-Card Club. I am a little girl,
nine years old; have dark hair, dark
brown eyes, and fair complexion. I
weigh only forty-nine pounds. I live
two and one-half miles from Rome,
Rt. No. 8. Igo to school every day;
am in the fourth grade. I think I
will be a teacher some day; I hope
to be, any way. We have a good
school out here. Prof. W. C. Rash
is principal. Miss Mollie Withers
and Miss Frankie Anderson are as
sistants. Papa takes both of the
Jeffersonians, and he certainly does
enjoy reading them. Professor Rash
takes them, too. Papa sent in his
subscription last week. Well, Daddy
Jim, I have a riddle for you and the
children; then I will ring off. Guess
I have written too much now. Two
Indians were going down the road.
A big Indian and a little Indian. The
little Indian was the big Indian’s son,
but the big Indian was not the little
Indian’s father. What relation was
the big Indian to the little Indian? —
Yours truly, Belle Smith, Rome, Ga.
ONLY A FEW FRECKLES.
Dear Daddy- Jim: —Here I come
again. This is my third time. lam
not going to school now; I may get
to go after Christmas. I think every
boy and girl ought to try to get an
education. We live in the country.
I don’t think I would like city life
much. I help mamma do ’most every
thing. I help papa, too. Nearly all
of the cotton here was destroyed by
the boll weevil. I have dark hair,
blue eyes, and light complexion;
only I have a few freckles on my
face. I hope Mr. Watson will be our
next President. I think he is the
smartest man in the United States.
Success to him and his paper.—Eva
Brewster, Rt. 2, Choudrant, La. Age,
fourteen years.
ANNIE LAURA’S POETRY.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
again. My aunt, who has been in
Florida, has come to live with us. I
think Mr. Watson so grand that I
made up a poem about him, which I
will send. We are needing rain bad
ly here. I spent the day at a cane
mill when my uncle was grinding.
The sun casts its brighest beams upon-
Mr. Watson so kind,
And he is the best one that you can
find;
The clearest stream runs for him al
ways.
May God bless him and keep him
all the days.
May he be loved and cherished by
everyone.
May he be carried across the river
to the Holy Son.
May we follow his footsteps in every
way. /
And grow more loving every day.
—Annie Laura Cheves, Pelham, Ga.
ANSWERING A RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little girl, fifteen years old, for ad
mittance into your happy band. I
live in the southwest corner of Worth
county, the garden spot of Southwest
Georgia. I live out in the country,
and have got what education I have
by going to school in the country,
except two terms in the little town
of Doerun. I am in the eighth
grade. Papa reads the weekly Jef
fersonian and Mr. Watson’s Maga
zine, and dearly loves Mr. Watson.
Says Mr. Watson is a natural born
statesman, and the best friend the
common people ever had. I have
four brothers and four sisters. We
make a living farming, and all the
Ghe 'Jeffersonian
By DADDY JIM
hands work in the field when neces
sary. We run two plows and culti
vate about sixty-five acres of land,
so you may know we are not rich
people. Will answer Lillie Mae Til
ley’s riddle: It is a lightning bug. I
will close for fear I make this too
long.—Addie Mae Smith, Rt. 3, Doe
run, Ga.
TRYING TO BE A TEACHER.
Hello, Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little Georgia girl from the red, hills
of Campbell county. I am twelve
years old, with blue eyes, light hair,
fair complexion, and weigh eighty
one pounds. My home is in the
country, three miles from Fairburn
and four miles from Palmetto. I live
in two hundred yards of Antioch
church and schoolhouse. lam going
to Fairburn high school this fall. I
am in the fifth grade. I enjoy going
to school very much, for I have a
fine teacher and intend to try to be a
teacher myself some day. I have
three sisters and one brother, all
older than me.—Your friend, Lilly
Milan, Fairburn, Ga.
A TEXAS PLAYHOUSE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—lt is cold now;
it looks like it is going to snow, but
I hope it wont. My papa is making
a chimney. He is going to the lake
Thursday; he went Monday and kill
ed two ducks and one crane. We
have seven little pigs. I just got
through making my doll a quilt, be
cause the winter is here and she will
get cold. I wrote to Santa Claus
what I wanted him to bring me. We
have two families of Mexicans here;
one Mexican has a little baby. It is
the prettiest little Mexican baby I
ever saw. I have a playhouse under
a tree and have sacks hung up to
keep the north wind out. My grand
ma and mamma are preserving and
canning tomatoes. Well, 1 can’t
think of anything more to write.
Love to all and best wishes to Daddy
Jim.—Lena Adams, Harlingen, Texas.
WILL GET SUBSCRIBERS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
boy, twelve years old. Igo to school
and am in the sixth grade. My teach
er’s name is Miss Ethel Autrey. Our
professor is Mr. W. G. Davis. I study
arithmetic, history, reading, English,
geography and spelling. My papa is
a strong believer in Mr. Watson. He
takes both Jeffersonians, and likes
the pieces on Foreign Missions. He
says “Mr. Watson is the only man in
the United States that has got
enough sense and nerve to speak the
truth.’’ I am trying to get a lot of
subscribers for the Jeffersonians. As
this is my first letter I will close.
Wishing the Jeffei*sonians much suc
cess.—Weaver Terrell, Tifton, Ga.
WANTS SOME CARDS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have often
thought of writing to the Post-Card
Club, but couldn’t pick up courage.
Papa takes both Jeffersonians, and
he would not do without them. He
has a Watson knife, and would not
take anything for it. He shows it to
every one that comes in. He thinks
there is no other man as good as Mr.
Watson. You ought to have been
with me Christmas, Daddy Jim, I
certainly had a nice time. We had
a Christmas tree at the school
house; I got lots of nice presents.
Among my presents was a Post-Card
Album, and I haven’t many cards. I
would like for all the members of
the Post-Card Club to send me a
card. I will try to answer all cards
received. I will describe myself and
stop. Have dark hair and eyes, dark
complexion, am five feet two inches
tall, weigh one hundred and five
pounds and am thirteen years old. —
Your friend, Georgia Wood, Heloise,
Tenn.
