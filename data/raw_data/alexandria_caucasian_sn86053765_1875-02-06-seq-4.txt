Fight Between a Cobra and a Mon
goose.
The snake was a large cobra 4 ft.
10 1—2 in. in length, the most form
idable cobra I have Been. lie was
turned into an enclosed outer room,
or verandah, about 20 ft. by 12., aud
at once coiled himself up, with head
erect, about ten or twelve inches from
the ground, and began to hiss loudly.
The mongoose was a small one of its
kind, very tame and quiet, but ex
ceedingly active.
When the mongoose was put into
the retanglc, it seemed scarcely to
notice the cobra ; but the latter, on
the contrary, appeared at once to re
cognize its enemy. It became ex
cited, and no longer seemed to pay
any attention to the bystanders, but
lcept constantly looking at the mon
goose. The mongoose began to go
round and round the enclosure, oc
casionally venturing up to the cobra,
apparently quite uncoucerned.
Some eggs being laid on the
ground, it rolled them near the cobra
and began to suck them. Oceassion
ally it left the eggs, and went, up to
cobrn, within an inch of its neck, as
the latter reared up ; but when the
cobra struck out, the mongoose was
away with extraordinaiy activity.
At length the mongoose began to
bite the cobra's Jail, and it looked as
if the fight would commence in earn -
est. Neither, however, seemed
anxious for close quarters, so the
enclosure was narrowed.
The mongoose then began to givo
the cobra some very severe biles ;
but the cobra after some fencing
forced the mongoose into a corner,
and struck it with full strength on
the upper part of the hind leg. We
were sorry for the mongoose, as but
for the enclosure it would have es
caped. It was clear that on open
ground the cobra could not have bit
ten it at all ; while it was the policy
of the mongoose to exhaust the cobra
before making a close attack. The
bite of the cobra evidently caused
the mongoose great pain, for il
repeatedly stretched out its leg, aud
shook it, as if painful, for some
minutes. The cobra seemed exhaust
ed by its efforts, and putting dovvn
its head, tried hard to escape, and
kept itself in a corner. The mon
goose then went up to it and drew it
out, by snapping at its tail, and when
it was out, began to bite its bodj,
while the cobra kept turning round
and round, striking desperately at
the mongoose, but in vain.
"
When this had continued for some
time, the mongoose camo at length
right in front of the c bra, and af
ter some dodging and fencing, when
the cobra was in the act of striking,
o>
or ralherrready to strike ont, the
mongoose, to the surprise of all, made
a sudden spring at the cobra, and bit
it in the inside of the upper jaw,
about the fang, and instantly jumped
back again. Blood flowed in large
drops from the mouth of the cobra,
anâ it seemed much weakened. It
was? easy now to see bow the fight
would end, as the mongoose became
mo-re eager for the struggle. It con
tinued to bite the body of the cobra,
goiing round it as before, and soon
came again in front, and bit it in the
upper jaw, when more blood flowed.
This continued for some time, until
at last, the cobra being very weak,
tl.e mongoose caught its upper jaw
firrhly, and holding down its head,
began to crunch it. The'cobra, how
ever, being a very strong one, often
got up again, and tried feebly to
strike the mongoose ; but the latter
now bit its head and body as it
pleàsed ; and when the cobra became
motioneless and dead, the mongoose
left it, and ran to the jungle.
The natives said that the mon
goose went to the jungle to eat tome
leaves to cure itself. We did not
wish to prevent it, and we expected
it would die, as it was severely bit
ten.
In the evening, some hours after
the fight, it returned, apparently
quite well, and is now as weil as ever.
It follows either that the bile of a
cobra is not fatal to a mongoose man
ages somehow to cure itse'.f. I am
not disposed to put aside altogether
what so many intelligent natives
positively assert.
This fight shows at any rate how
these active little animals manage to
kill poisonous snakes. On open
ground a snake cannot strike them,
whereas they can bite the body and
tail of tv snake, and wear it out be
fore coming to close quarters. This
mongoose did not seem to fear the
cobra at all ; whereas the cobra was
evidently in great fear from the mo
ment it saw the mongoose.

That, old and reliable paper, the lions

the First Drawing:
"jNot even the most captions and sus

the maimer of the drawing. It was fair,
honorable and equitable. " The commit

citizens, and kindly gave their time and
labor to the superintendence of the draw

"C.U'T. FOSTER has acted honorably
and fairly throughout the whole manage

money has been made by the venture iu
all probability, yet the property given as
prizes lias only netted a fair price, and the
profit is only an exchange of the property
for cash."

Houston Age, has tli« following:

This was well received and understood,

Capt . FOSTER said that while he wish

was free to say that with the people of
poor Mississippi, Louisiana and South Car

did hope they would draw the largest
