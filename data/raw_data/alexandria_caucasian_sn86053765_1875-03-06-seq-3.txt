A dew stalks of cotton came up
near the gin where the laud had
been very highly manured. They
were cultivated with the" hoe, and

these stalks were very luxuriant

nil their fruit. He had soino of
them dug up to ascertain the-canse,
and discovered that when the root»
reached the hard pan, instead of
penetrating, they were diverted ami
nui along its upper surface. It in
true that the tap root ol cotton will
penetrate the hard alluvial clay of
the bottom of the Mississippi and
periia'ps of Bed Ki ver, hut the cla y
ol thosu bottoms is as soluble to
water as sugar, and yields as read
ily to the iiioisf touch of the root a»
sugar would to tlie touc h of a moist
hair pencil. But the process of
furuishing moisture enough to dis
solve this clay and at the same time
supply the leaves and stalk is a
slow, tedious and exhausting one,
and often .results in an entire «us.
jiensloti of the growth of the stalk.
Wheu this is the case, uny rain
subsequent, causes what is termed
a second growth, which entails the
tbtowlngjoff all forms, and all bowls,
not half grown. If tbené hard sub

roots to penetrate, all this danger
and loss will be avoided. No cot

We recently noticed a convention
of Apiurht'is at Louisville, and we
have read of no conventioin wh
members seemed in such easy am
affluent circumstances. They enme
and went, /and feasted and coun
seled together upon tho gold they
had gathered from the wing of the
busy b» e, and stilt told of abun
dance, and of comfortable houses
they liad left. These, members were
all tour Northern latitudes, where
spring delays until the first of May
and where the winter, meets tlie
Fall iu the middle of September.
They weré from densely populated
countries, and told of what and
how they planted to make pastures
for their bees, and these pastured
upon lands which were worth fifty
dollars per acre. If these men
have made money, why cannot we

that it lequires as long to make one,
pound of wax, as to make twenty
five pounds of honey, and means
have been devised to extract the
honey without destroying or injur
ing the comb. With such an ar,
rangement, a single hive has been
made to produce .400 pounds of
honey, worth in New York from
twenty to twenty-five cents per
pound. One hundred hives' would
not more than occupy tho idle
hours of an iiidnlstl ions farmer, but
if they occupied half his time and
produced 100 pounds to the hive,
what is there that pays so well;
even if each produced but fifty
pounds, or even twenty-five pounds
to the hive, we can still ask what is
there that pays so well. Lut this is
not all. Surely there is nothing in
nature more beautiful and vyonder

spent his life in studying his %ôn

us how to learn from him
lessons in economy, in patriot

and order; in scientific construction
iu statesmanship, and true royalty;
that royalty which lives aud
breathes iu the true and
deep affection of her subjects

medicinal effects as tho celebrated
Hot Springs of Arhniisas.^
No Leper has yet bathed in its
waters aud not been. healed. No
ulcer, no totter or other cutaucous
disease, bat yields to its cure.
After a bath of four or five minutes,
the bather for the ifrst time, is al
most alarmed to find himself as
red as, if painted with vermilion.
So powerful has been the action of
the water, that the blood , seemed
almost ready to exude from eVery
pore. In ten or fifteen minutes
this is followed by an exhiler.ition
which almost resembles the exhil
erating effect of ether. That the
sallow hues of miasmas aud other
causes of i!! health would soon be

Within two hundred yards of this
Sulpher well, is a spring, whose
waters bnbble with "etfervescing
gass and' when sweetened, make a
delicious and refreshing lemouado.
What its medieiual properties are,
hare not yet been ascertained.
Their sour taste is perhaps like the
water of sour lake, which seems to
be iu the same strata or chain of
mineral wou^É-s, due to Sulphuric
Acid. This Spring and Well are
not like the Hot Springs of Arkan
sas situated amid harrpn rocks and
mountains but in a regiou where
Or;mge orchards, produce a thou
sand dollars per acre per annum
Where wax bushes produce wax,

be made to teem with rich harvest
of rice, Corn, cottou. and the hun
dred and one ot.'ier crops of the
fruitful South, aiiil where limpid
streams of pure wotcr abound with
excellent trout.
Uow many sections of Louisiana
abound with sources if not similar,
yet of equal advantages, ami pre
equally unknown to the world. The
day is not far distant when the un
tivalcd valley of Bed Iii ver wiil be
more celebrated for its rich uns

and sheep, and cattle and wheat
and rice that it has ever been, for
its cotton and sugar. But our ar
