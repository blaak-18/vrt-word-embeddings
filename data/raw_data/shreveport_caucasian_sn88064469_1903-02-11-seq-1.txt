THE CRAWFORD CASE
Continued Until Thursday on Account
of an Absent Witness for
the Defense.
The case of I)r. G. B. Crawford and
his son, Dr. C. C. Crawford. was called
for trial yesterday but was continued
until this morning on account of the ab
sence of a witness for the defendant.
The same plea was submitted this morn
ing when the case was called, and it was
continued until tomorrow.
The crime for which Dr. Crawford
and his son were indicted, murder, was
committed in the Manhattan saloon.
The murder resulted from a trivial
matter. Dr. Crawford and his son had
called for a drink of whiskey, the qual
ity of which was disputed. The barkeep
er. J. H. Vickers, remonstrated kindly
to vile epithets offered to him by Craw
ford's son. When the barkeeper had
reached the point where en.lurance
ceased to be a virtue, lie walked from
behind the bar with the intent of eject
ing Crawford's son from the saloon.
Vickers was unarmed. As he walked to
the space between the end of the counter
and the screen he was shot and killed
by Dr. Crawford, Sr., who had his pistol
ready and had been holding it in hand
at his side before using it. This in sub
stance is the gist of the testimony as
given by witnesses of the deed. At the
preliminary which followed Dr. C. C.
Crawford was discharged and Dr. G.
B. Crawford a few days later was re
leased on bond. But when the grand
jury was convened the father and the
son were indicted for murder. On being
informed of the indictment the Craw
fords came from their home in Red
River parish and surrendered to Sheriff
Ward and were jailed.
This case has aroused considerable
attention and promises to be one of the
most vigorously contested in recent
years. The Crawfords have a large fol
lowing of friends from Red River who
are hopeful of their acquittal. The
Crawfords are represented by Thigpen
& Foster, Wells & Wells and Maples &
McDonald. The district attorney, John
R. Land, will be assisted by J. H. Shep
herd and M. C. Elstner. From the per
sonnet of the attorneys the readers who
know them will appreciate the power
and influence which will be directed to
acquittal and conviction. After all, the
verdict will rest with the jury.
VALUE OF A FRANCHISE.
At this time when the public mind is
directed to the demands for franchises
for street railways and the extension of
franchises for the same enterprises, the
query naturally should be, what is the
value of a franchise?
What is fifty years? Half a century
may be the curt reply, but how many,
if any. of the gentlemen now clamoring
for franchises and the extension of fran
chises will be alive, in the active flesh,
doing and directing their affairs in this
world? Perhaps not one!
And then, at the end of fifty years,
when the grant shall have expired be
cause otfits limits, who will become pos
sesised of the tracks and the cars and
all the appurtenances thereto belonging?
.In fifty years, by the very limitationof
the time, these franchisese will have be
come extinct, dead. Bu: we hear the re
ply of some wireacre: "Oh, the privi
lege will be extended to fifty years
or-more." Very well, but by whom-and
to whosm? Fifty years is half a century,
arid we realize that our bones will have
imoldered into dust. Our dealing shall be
with the present, the liying. It is true
that the terms of a franchise gives it
dmore or less value, a presumptive value
if you will, btt an investor would more
readily take the bonds, certificates or
stock of a fifty- hai a twenty-five-year
franchise, and therefore it is not sur
prising that -men seeking privileges
favor the amaxinmu. instead of the. mini
i`l limit. A franchise may be worth a
million or-less; it i speculative, A fran
dise, however; gives a guarantee of
ier-taln privileges for a fixed term of
yeawu. With this guarantee as security,
e ises which dexelop industries and
s t, directly and indirectly, the
general welfare are encouraged in their
estn~ent of capital. We believe that

Sthat men who engage in enter

pctation of -5Jre -rewards commensu

gg he-the v ,hue of a franchise is not

`ar ia; the puinion that a

monopoly forever, but when the city.
for instance, gi ants a franchise it should
reserve certain rights as equivalents t o
the grant. For instance, the city has
granted to the W\\ater Work-; Company
one of the most liberal franchises ever
written. and yet the ci:y is compelled
to pay thousands of dollars annually for
the use of twater which it should have
free. So it is with the gas and electric
light plants. If the city had reserved its
privileges, it should now have its light
ing free of cost as a compensation for
the grant to the company operating the
lights.
\\here stands the dear, good people in
the contention for privileges and exten
sions by certain gentlemen pleading be
fore the council? The city has rights
which. should be reserved clearly. The
people have rights which should he pro
tected; safeguarded at least.
IFor any and all concessions granted.
the.people should have consileration.
For instance, the main line of street ear
track on lexas street up to Common
street should he relieved of its monopo
listic feature. It should be opened for
use to any other corlmpany which would
desire to operate, for instance, a line up
Sprague street. lThe use of this Texas
street track to Conmmon street should
be regulated on a basis of compensation
which would be fair and equitable. A
prohibitive rate should not be possible.
With this feature there shouldT.e the
fixed privilege of transfer from one line
ir connection to any other for one fare,
mnd there should also be fixed the mini
mum fare, say two cents, for--all boys
and girls going to and from school: and
the puhlic should he protected against
tny pretense or imlosition in the opera
tion of short lines or connections in the
corporate limits, and the city should be
safeguarded and the city should be pro
tected fully in all its rights and privi
leges as to street improvements and
crossings and should receive such hene
,its which must accrue to the welfare of
the public as will he fair. While others
may plead for this and that company or
.rporation, the Caucasian would insist
that the council shall not .neglect the
consideration of what is due the people
while they confer grants on e+ir.ations
which must thrive and prosper through
the support of the people.
THE CONCEALED WEAPON.
The man who kills another is apt to
shoot beyond his victim and hit the
heart of a wife, a mother, a sister, a de
pendent child or somebody who loves
she slain even as the slayer loves or is
beloved by those who are dear to him.
What a shadow of a man must bring
apon himself when he slays a husband
and-father, the family bread-winner, and
thus bows an innocent woman in bitetr
grief and takes from helpless childhood
the natural protector of which it ever
stands in need! Not for all the gold in
the world nor for all its honors could a
brave-minded, true-hearted man consent
to do such a thing as this. What un
speakable folly it is for a man to per
mit brute anger, aroused over a differ
:nce of opinion, to lead him to murder.
It is more than folly. It is the entrance
to hell. To the criminal habit or prac
tice of pistol carrying may be traced
most murders. The man who makes a
practice of going about secretly armed
falls short of the measure of a good
citizen. He is not only ready to defy
the law, he has already violated it.
Nashville American.
But when a man who carries about
him the handy and the ready pistol with
which to defend himself against some
fancied injury or for the most trivial of
matters, kills another, unarmed and
without giving his victim an opportun
ity for defense, what is the result? Is
there any sympathy for the widow and
orphans of the bread-winner, slain
cowardly and as if he were a mad dog?
Upon whom is sympathy directed if it
be not towards the man who has killed
and murdered another wantonly? Why
this maudlin sympathy, this disregard
of all reasonable and jutt law? The
brave, honorable man, seeking no fan
cied enemy and bearing no ill-will to
man, will not go about the streets of a
civilized community with the handy and
ready pistol concealed about him, and
if. unfortunately, he should slay an
other, on the slightest provocation. such
1 man should expect and should receive
the punishment which is provided for
such crime.

Letter From Warm Climate.
"Speaking of pulpit jokes," a church
goer remarked. "I have yet to hear a
better one than that on a reverend gen
tleman of a small congregation in the
city. He is a fine preacher, a man
along in years, loved and revered by
his flock. His pulpit utterance's never
verge upon levity of any sort. He ab
hors a resort to humor in church.
"One Sunday evening he was speak
ing to his congregation about Mrs
Jones, one of the prominent wo:nen of
his church, who had gone south for hen
health. In his previous remarks h
had, with feeling, referred to Mrs.
Smith, who had recently left this world
for a better one.
"He startled his hearers' by saying:
'I have just received a letter from Mrs
Smith. She says it is very warm
whare she is now.'
"Shocked at the audible titter in the
staid congregation, the good man paus
ed, looked blank and then gasped, 'I
meant from Mrs. Jones;,' and hastily
announced the hymn." - New York

Willam R. Travers, the New York

go to an address in suburban Brooklyn,
but, being unacquainted with the local

rections. It so happened that the stran
ger stuttered and stammered quite as
badly as Travers, who after the man
had made two or three ineffectual at
tempts to answer grew angry under
the impression he was being mocked
and hotly inquired:
"Howd-d-dare you t-t-iry to m-m-mock

"Ex-ex-excuse m-me!" exclaimed the
stranger. "I have an im-Im-impedi

First Love.
People who marry while very young
are apt to fAnd out when it is too late -

Some, indeed, may advise couples t(
marry before they are out of their teens
and settle down before the distractions
of the world can attempt to shake theh

by an unsettled condition that lasts for
the rest of their unhappy lives. See

Eevn in England. where the liquor

iad this effect. The insurance that
