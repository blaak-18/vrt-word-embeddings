The Corners.--Cut the material from

four threads each way through the

TOLD OF AUTHORS.
Why P'r.a. 't. Bullen Broke Into
Litr t ' ui re.
(SpeCiaL ( 'H I+, :r ,,ulnd nce.]
New Yu1l:u ,n. 12. The literary be.
ginnings of successful authors are al
ways a subject of interest. IUufortu
nttr ly not all authors are willing to be
per'ictly frank. Perhaps the.y forget.
At any rate, one Is led to think that
most of them were born with pen in
hand nd their youthful heads full of
plots and chararnters.
Frank T. Bulen, who writes most
entertainln;4ly of thk sea, is not one of
those who were born to letters. At a
recent dinner of the London Authors'
club Mr. Hullen declared he wrote his
first book under the stress of, necessity,
with no idea of ever writing a second.
He was earning $10 a week when he
began "The Cruise of the Cachelot,"
for which he received $500 in a lump.
He had never seen so much money at
once before. so he concluded to stick
to authorship. But even now he is so
little of a "literary man" that he in
sists he has noticed no envy, hatred o:
uncharitableness in the literary life,
and he-talks of his adopted calling in
a manner which would never discour
age any youth from taking to litera
ture, which, of course, is iery wrong.
Most of us think very well of Mr. Bul
len's books nevertheless.
Apropos of Richard Le Gallienne's
new book, "An Old Country House,"
which Harper & Bros. have just pub
lished, several stories of the author are
going the rounds, among them the fol
lowing, which Mr. Le Gallienne has
good hunmoredly told himself. When he
was a young accountant in Liverpool
long before he became famous as a
writer of exquisite prose and verse, he
wore his hair several inches longer
than the other lads among his acquaint
ance. One day he was summoned to the
private office of the firm which en
gaged his youthful services.
The flim was composed of four men.
one of them a Scotchman, and all were
seated aroudd a table in dignified state
when Itf Gallienne appeared, wonder
ing what he was in for.
"Mr. Le Gallienne," 4aid the Scotch
member solemnly and with a falling in
fiection, "the firm has decided t"at if
