WHAT HAD HAPPENED
By Wade Caldwell
The hot rays of the mid-July sun
danced with the yellow dust up the
long, dry road. Down towards a
small crek, which the road crossed
by a ford, traveled a man. His old
frayed clothes were covered with the
yellow dust, and so were his grayish,
unkept beard and hair. His breath
was fast and jerky, an hectic hue
were his cheeks, and he coughed a
dry, rasping cough. Incidentally, he
carried a staff. It was not a very
dandyish staff. It was merely the
limb of a tree picked up by the road
side, and it was gnarly and crooked
and ove r large. But it served him,
and he leaned heavily upon it as he
walked. In sooth, he had the mien
of a very old man, yet he had round
ed the cycle of the seasons but five
and forty times.
When he was come to the creek
he squatted by the margin of the
cool, clear water and bathed his
hands and face. And then, when he
had tightened the strings in his old
rundown, toeless shoes, he feebly
arose an d gazed blankly up the road
in front of him. Atop of a hill a
mile or more this way he could see
a small settlement. It was his desti
nation. But his dull gray eyes
showed no manner of emotion at that
fact.
A short way below the county
road the very wide and deep gulch
of the creek was spanned by a mas
sive iron bridge, over which a rail
road passed. To this structure the
traveler turned his vision, pushed
the battered derby back from his
high, full forehead, and began pull
ing his. long straight nose medita
tively. There was a peculiar charm
about it to him—about the bridge.
He had been viewing it for some lit
tle time when a heavy freight train
approached. And, as the train en
tered upon the bridge he gave a vio
lent start. His stooped shoulders
became erect and his dull gray eyes
blazed with a strange fire. Intently,
he looked and listened at
the bridge. When the train had
crossed and gone on its way he went
over to one of the abutments and
climbed up to the roadbed. Cough
ing and panting, he picked up an
iron bolt and stadted along the
bridge, halting every few steps and,
placing one end of his staff against
his front teeth, set the other on a
girder or beam, which he tapped
with the bolt.
The bridge-warden was eyeing him
askance. The warden had seen
many of his kind pass the bridge
daily during the past ten years; but
he ha d never seen one act as this
one.
Directly the strange inspector
stopped, got down and took a look
at the underworks of the bridge and,
when he arose he called the warden
and told him that the builders of the
bridge failed to allow sufficient space
for expansion in times of such severe
heat as then prevailed; that one of
the main girders had wrung loose
from its fellows and lacked but an
inch of being off the head of the pier,
and that the next train to start over
it would go down.
The warden, now that the danger
was shown him, could appreciate it
well enough; minding that the next
train was the limited, that it was
nearly due, he struck of hurriedly to
meet and stop it.
He with the bolt and staff made
his way slowly back towards the end
of the bridge, his critical eyes close
ly scrutinizing each and every part
of it as he came along, condemning
here, commending there , the work
of its builders. When he was come
to the abutment he turned and was
taking a comprehensive view of the
whole structure when, of a sudden,
there fell upon his ears the tones of
a bell, announcing the noon hour at
the settlement on the hill. Instantly
the fire died out of his eyes, his
shoulders drooped again, and he
coughed violently as he passed back
down the embankment and out to the
road.
The warden, several hundred
yards ilp the railroad, casually glanc
ed back, and, perceiving that the
late inspector had taken to the road
again, his face flushed as if he had
received a sudden inspiration. Di
rectly he met and stopped the
Limited and told the crew of the
danger at the bridge. Incidentally
stating that he himself had found it.
The grateful passengers made him
up a handsome purse, and a million
aire aboard with his sick wife gave
him a diamond ring.
Meantime, he with tlu hectic
cheeks and dry cough was walking
slowly up towards the settlement on
the hill. At one place he passed a
harvest field. Under a great oak
near the roadside were several lusty
young harvesters. Their hats were
off, their sleeves rolled up, and their
shirt-bosoms were open, revealing
their sinewy arms and chests, full of
life and rich red blood. Their faces
were full of joy, still moist from a
recent bath in hard by.
Across the stubble towards them
came a girl, in her early teens. She
wore a large sundown, the long dark
folds of her unbound hair fell about
her neck and shoulders. She carried
a hamper in her hand, while a large
collie galloped and scampered about
her as she tripped along. She was
fetching dinner to her brothers in
the harvest field.
The harvest scene set the doves of
mother-pride pecking at the travel
er’s conscience till he stopped and
began to look about him. He, too,
had swun g the cradle , he, too, had
bound the yellow sheaves and plied
them for his father to shock; and he,
too, once had a sister who fetched
dinner to him in the harvest field!
But the rodents of hunger gnawing
at his stomach, and the rodents of
death gnawing at his heart, soon
urged him on again.
The road was very rough, he
stumbled into many small washes
and stumped his sore toes against
many stones, but he did not groan.
The element of self-pity had perish
ed out of his being long ago. So,
like the dumb, dull ox, he bore his
ills uncomplainingly and ambled fee
bly, slowly on up to the settlement
on the hill.
It was not a very imposing place.
Just a few low, whitewashed frame
buildings amidst a tolerable grove of
old gnarly elms. In sooth, the very
name of the place caused it to be
shunned by saint and sinner.
Presently he entered the yard,
passed over to the pump w r here he
bathed his hands and face, then sat
down on the curbing, coughed and
panted. He saw many others simi
lar to himself , wasted by age and
incurable diseases, passing about
him. Some -were alone and silent,
others were mumbling over for the
hundredth time to heedless com
rades a tale of their former wealth
and unjust fall. Os one of these he
asked for the superintendent. And,
being directed to a portly, midddle
aged man overseeing some work out
near the margin of the grove, he
went to the latter and, in a few
words, told his story. The superin
tendent was a man whose actions
were governed rather by opinions
than sentiment. His small, dark
eyes read more in a moment concern
ing the man before him than tongue
could have told in a long time. And
without any idle questioning he call
ed a servant, telling him to see this
man to room “27.”
Once within his small cell-like
room he stretched himself upon the
low, hard bunk on which many poor
wretches before him had spent their
last hours. Yet, it was rest to him.
The best he had known for many a
long day!
As he lay there upon his straw
matress and gazed about him at the
dingy interior of his narrow, un
kept room, lit by a single small win
dow, did those golden dreams of his
splendid youn g manhood come back
to him again? Ah, dreams, but not
3effersoniait
all vanity; for his was the intellect
to lead, the physical strength to act,
the energy and ambition to push on
to any heights of fame and glory. I
say, did those visional days return to
him as he lay there, alone, dying, in
the —poorhouse? No, ah, no! We
hope the goo d God spared him that!
“ ‘27’ is dead,” said the warden to
the superintendent one morning nine
days later. There was no tinge of
sentiment in the words. “ ‘27’ is
dead.” He said it as though he had
been announcing idnner. And why
not? Was anybody sorry? Were
the other inmates aggrieved? Not
much; it was one less to eat. Were
the servants sad? Not at all; it was
one less to wait on. Did the super
intendent weep? Hardly; it wasn’t
his nature to do so. No, no crape
hung from the door-knobs, no hand
kerchiefs concealed tear-suffused
eyes, no church bell tolled the death
hour away!
A rectangular pineboard box was
shoved into a spring wagon, hurried
down to the depot, heaved aboard a
baggage car, and whirled away to a
distant city, to the table of anatomy
—as it was a law of the State that
the bodies of all dying at the place
should go.
Ah, Sir Savant, when you had dis
sected that body and shown the tyros
how King Alcohol and the Great
White Plague had done their work,
did you lay bare that brain and there
seek a cause for the effect you had
already explained? Say, did you see
if the chords of fellow-love and fel
low-sympathy were still intact? For
something snapped asunder there one
day, and Ben McGalloway fell, fell
from an earthly heaven to an earthly
hell!

AS I WENT OUT FROM IRRISH
GLEN.
As I went out from Irrishglen
A beggar asked an alms from me,
I gave him half my barley-cake,
Then smiled his smile of thanks to
see.
“Why halve the gift?” my heart it
said,
“One gave His Life for outcast
men,”
So in the beggar’s hands I laid
The other piece in Irrishglen.
An’ since that day my fire of peats
Has ne’er grown dim by day or
night,
The cruse of barley-meal ne’er fails,
I’ve bite an’ sup for hungry wight;
No more the beggar’s face I’ve seen,
Tho’ oft I’ve watched the way, but
then
I think as I went forth that day,
Perhaps He came to Irrishglen.

PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
Martin, Tenn.
“I had a curiosity to see
whether the Primitive Baptist
was as unfair, hide-bound, ar
rogant and abusive as the pa
pers run by missionary fa
natics. . . . To my agreeable
surprise I found that the
whole build and spirit of the
paper was up to my ideal of a
Christian paper. ... In choos
ing your religious reading,
you might give the Primitive
Baptist a trial, even though
you are not of that faith and
order. You’ll get some really
religious literature, if you
do.”—Thos. E. Watson in The
