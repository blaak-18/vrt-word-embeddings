what a jolly farmer said as he entered

says he, Salser's seeds not only cgrow
-but they produce enormously. Had I
planted a few acres more -of his cats,

.A good walk from the barn to the
dairyroom makes a good walk to the
house as well. On this, a 30-gallon can
mounted on a stout, iron-wheeled cart,
carries the skim-milk and garbage
from the house to the barn and pig-.
way. Every kitchen should be abun
dantly supplied with water, and the
two rooms may be furnished with very
little additional outlay. A good cis
tern is neded for the kitchen range, a
ood well for cookinga, drinking and
buttermal ing. The well should have
a pump attached to the line shaft, that
the horse may fill a large tank with
water for cooling the cream, washing
the butter, etc. The central point of
work about a farmhouse is the kitchen.
The work of the dairyroom is largely
connected with it; so keep them toh
gether and the conveniences of one
will help the other.-Clara T. Sison,
in Rural New Yorker.

thority on all subjects pertaining to or
chards and fruits says it is a good placn
to plant some crop amone young trees,

_goes on and says cultivate the crop
ought to be cultivated, we feel like
protesting. Too much cultivation can
not be given young trees any more
trouble is that too many times young
orchards are neglected in this respecl.
Cultivate your trees as much as po ss

MEDICAL
DISCOVERY
Many years ago Dr. K. V. Pierce. chief
consulting physician to the Invalids' Hotel
and-- Surgical Institute, Buffalo, N. Y., com
pounded this medicine of vegetable Ingredi
ents which had an especial effect upon the
stomach and liver, rousing the orans to
healthful activity as well as purifing and
enricbing the blood. By such means the
stomach and the nerves are supplied with
par blo b : they will not do duty without it
any more than a locomotive can ran with
out coal. You can not get a lasting cure of
Dyspepsia, or Indigestion, b. taking arti
ficially digested foods or pepsin-the atom
.ach must do its own work in its own way.
Do not put your nerves to sleep with so
called celery mixtures, it is better to go to
the seat of the difficulty and feed the nerve
cells on the food they require. Dyspei .,
Indigestion, Biliousness and NTervous T
fections, such as sleeplessness and wtdk,
nervous feelings are completely cured by
the "Discovery." It puts on healthy flesh,
brings refreshing sleep and invigorates the
whole system.
