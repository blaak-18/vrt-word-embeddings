"lIon. William V, Allen, Chair
man, and others, members of
the Notification Committee of
the People's Party :
"Gentlemen-The nomination of
the People's party for the Presi
dency of the United States has
been tendered me in such a gene
rous spirit and upon such honora
ble terms that I am able to acccept
the same without departing from
the platform adopted by the Dem.
ocratic national convention at Chi
cago. I fully appreciate the
breadth of patriotism which has
actuated the members of the Peo
ple's party, who, in order to con
solidate the sentiment in favor of
bimetalism, have been willing to go
outside of party lines and support
as their candidate one already nom
inated by the Democratic party,
and also by the Silver party.
"I also appreciate the fact that
while, during all the years since
1878 a large majority of the Dem
ocratic party and a considerable
minority of the Republican party
have been consistent advocates of
free einage of silver at the pres
ent ratio, yet ever since the orgam
zation of the People's party its
members have unanimously sup
ported such coinage as the only
means of restoring bimetallism.
By persistently pointing out the
diastrous efects of the gold stand
ard and protestinh each successive
step toward financial odge, the
Populists have exerte an impor
tant influence i awakening the
public to a realization of the na
tion's present peril.
"In a time like this, when a
great political party is attempting
to surreader the right to legislate
for ourselves on the finanial ques
tion and is seeking to bind the
America# people to a foreign
netary system, it behooves us
asjqivt of our country mandl friends
ot A° u usn Institutions to lay
aside for the present such diferea
eas as may exist among us on mi
nor questions in order that our
stregthmay be united in a sa
preme seort to wrest the govern
ment from the hands of those who
imagine that the nati'sa finances
a oal ecurse when oetrolled by
a few fmniers and that national
honor ean only be mantained 'by
servik oeunisseene in any policy,
h'bwerer destractive to the inter
-els a the ao of the United
Sar. s, wwiaorneigu creditors,
tp eror potive, may desire
for
w 4'tbBri~sbp w
international binetalisam now ,join
with us rather than trust the des
tiny of the nation to those who are
holding out the delusive hope of
foreign aid while they labor secret
ly for the permanent establishment
of the single gold standard.
"While difficulties always arise
in the settlement of the details of
any plan of co-operation Ibetween
distinct political organizations, I
am sure that the advocates of bi
metalism are so intensely in ear
nest that they will be able to devise
some means by which the free sil
ver vote may be concentrated upon
one electoral ticket in each State.
To secure this result, charity to
ward the opinions of others and
liberality on the part of all is nec
essary, but honest and sincere
friends who are working toward a
common result always find it pos
sible to agree upon just and equit
able terms.
"The American people have
proven equal to every emergency
that has arisen in the past, and I
am confident that in the present
emergency there will be no antag
onism between the various regi
ments of the one great army which
is marching to repel an invasion
more dangerous to our welfare
than an army with banners.
"Acknowledging with gratitude
your expressions of confidence and
good will, I am, very truly yours,
W. J. BR AN."

Sept. the 20 eighth lsninety6.
Mister Editur: We hay got the
Pops bi the umBilly-kuss. Tha
air our mete. We kaught em with
a silver bate. We coaxed on to
nominait Brian and now we're
hirein uv em tu swallow Suall. In
Kansis tha hay taken him doun at
a gulp-conciderashun, the oflises
and everything else in site. In
Coloraidc, ditto. In Mizzoori tha
swallow 3 fourths uv him and in
Illinois 5 sixths uv him. Consid
erashuns in Missoory not meation
ed; in Illinpis a fu oflises. The
ouher staits about averages this
wa. So you see we hay jist about
swallered the Pops party. The
bargains air all maid and sined by
the leeders. Tha air tu deliver
the voters on election day bi the
do.aen tied up in bunches. This
is aal fixed. We thot thair wood
be sum trubbel to maik these deels
as the pope hav alwaze boasted uv
bein a party uv prinsipol. But
the dont seem to hay any prinsi
pol this year but git thar eli. • The
leeders air nearly aul on our band
waggle and Iots uv the rank and
Ale air fallif in behind and shoutin
fur demokratic suckaess. The
leeders sa tha wil aul faul in purty
sane. I hasp so. Tha belong tu
us. We bvy bought em and pade
fur em, and tha ortent tu kick
against bein delivered. That wood
tb repodiashun, besides we're hol
din uv em tu us bi calin uv em
Sianerkrats. This haz a magic
S on eam. Evry boddy is a
wr dla want to be
deliveredl ovetr t u --is. You se W(
ne d1 cat in our hiziness and hav
Lot tu havy ia at any p)rice. But
we're gittin uv cm plrty cheep.
Ennv man who wouldl sell out to
old Ilanner and Mackinley iz a
trater tu hiz kuntrv.
Brian haint ax.-pte l the poipu
list nomiinashun andl haint a gain
tu. What's the use uv axseptin
it when we have bought thi wholec
lob iot uv lpops eoinway We
have the best ticket and largest as
sortment uv Vic.! Presidents ever
exhibited undler on;e cuobinashuu,
Adlishun free; gittiu out prise
not yet settled on.
Thar is only one thing bothers
nmi sercenity. What if the pop
leeders couldh't deliver the votes,
and uthier leeders that dont believe
in scllin out should git it intu their
heds to lead a revolt! I kin hear
low nmutterins now. M hat if it
should Iecum a svklone ? We
would be skoop.ed in Kansis. It
wortd dump us in Coloraido, ruin
us in Misoory, defeat us in Iowa
and brake our backbone in Nebras
ka. We air aulrttddy beet in Illi
noS. And enny dadgummed par
ty that would bi sich fools az.
Taubeneck, Maxwell and Taylor
and then put them on the ticket
ort tu be defeeted. We ort tu hav
paid cash fur them and salted etn
doun in the bak-ground. Tha dont
even maik good stule pigons fur
tha haint got sense enutf tu kepe
thair mouth shut.
Mi chances fur sheruff iz brite
if I kin git enuff peopel tu voat
fur me. If the pops lont fli the
track I think I'm aul rite. And I
don't see how tlm kin when we've
aulreddy padoe ur em and the kon
tract iz signed up. But I'm afraid
Ike Hawkins iz goin to caus sum
trubble. lie ~ez he wil see the
demokratie party ded, darnmed and
delivered before he will vote fur
enny frackshunal part uv a demo
krat. And Ike iz a good deel uv
punkins amung the Populists. He
sez he don't want tu help rezerrekt
an old karcuss that decoccy sug
gests ort tu've been buried twenty
years ago. HIe sez he kaint see
the pint in votin fur 20) Suall elek
tors in order to put up 4 Watson
men tu be knocked down. lic
don't propose to vote 4 twenty
fourths, four seventeenths or any
uther part nv a demokantio ticket.
He sez he's for standin bi the ak
shun uv the nashinal konvenshun or
bust. He swares if Allen, Weav
er, Idolcomb, Jerry Simpson, Petf
fer and uthers who the party has
honored wants tu go ott after faulse
gods he'd be da<igummed if he's
goin to foiller, and if he kaint du
enny better he will sta at home on
elekshun da. and kamp in the mid
del uv-the-road til the perseshin
ketches up. That's ]ist what Im
afrade uv and it will knok us out
anl over. Things begin to look a
little btu and I feel like sumthin
Iort to be dun to git these diseatis
fide Hannerkrats tu vote fur me
and Brian and a frackshunal part
uv 8uall. Yours, horderin on dis
tres, Tohe Spilkins,
Kanidkae fur sheruff.

You'll Laugh
.If You Read
This funny and instructive LooIk
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took (;rover
Cleveland from the White house
in the deal of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahonma
City, to tramp home. G rover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
!vecrybdy Should Read It.
It contains 176 pages of laugh
provoking matter, and 44 full-pa1e
illietrations of Cleveland Ias a
tramp.
