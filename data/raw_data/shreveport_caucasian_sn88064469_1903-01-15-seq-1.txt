HEAD CRUSHED.
Josephine Lacalle 11urdered *si Per
Bed.
Sunday morning the almost lifeless
body of Josephine Lecalle was found in I
her bed, at the home of Mr. Tovinsky.
where she resided on Fannin street near
St. Paul's bottom. The deceased, cot
ored. was about ;o years old and was
a loving, faithful nurse. In the bed with
her two of Mr. Tovinsky's children. one
aged four years and the other much
younger. These. lowever. were not mo
lested and they slept unconscious of the
crime committed. It was the groans of
the unfortunate nurse attracted the at
tention of the family early that morn
ing, and their horror may be imagined
when they realized what had happened.
The police on being advised some to the
house promptly and the old nurse was
taken to the sanitarium. where she died
at 2 o'clock Sunday afternoon. Without
going into the harrowing details it may
be said that a negro, Harry Jones. from
remarks made by him. was suspected,
l and when arrested by the police the
shoes he woretfitted exactly the tracm:s
in the yard and the premises. What
could have been his motive may be sur
mised. It is believed that he was in the
house with intent of robbery and having
been recognized by the old auntie he
struck her on the head with a stick of
stove wood which was found on the
bed. The circumstantial links are being
forged with irresistible certainty against
Harry Jones by the police.
PAID, BUT PROTESTED.
Object to the Restraints of the Sunday
Law.
Os Friday afternoon a delegation of
salotn men comprising J. L. Tilly, Jr..
L. Bergman, Charles Leadman. Frank
Serwich, Davis Bros., J. E. McAdams.
E. Bo.negent, P. Draiss, J. W. Selsor.
J. U. Curlee and H. C. Brewster, ac
comnpapied by their attorneys. Messrs.
M. C. Elstner and Pinckney Wells, Jr.,
called on the city comptroller. Mr. C.
G. Rives, for the purpose of paying
thet' license fo rthe year 1903. Through
th' ys, M. C. Elstner and
T. }1s; tsie amount of each license,
$soo less the deductions for Sunday,
which were tendered and declined, and
on that may follow a- test case in court.,
The license, $5oo, was then paid under
protest for each of the saloons. The
question if tested would be a novelty,
and. while no lawyer, the opinion may
be expressed that the decision would be
in favor of the city. It could not be held'
that the city is discriminating against
saloons as to the requirements of clos
ing on Sundays. Every kind of business
for which a license is issued-except
such as are exempted by law-must be
clos~4 andite 1closed on Sundays. The
Fozs are of the excepted class;
.' the dry goods and other men
aged in trade atpl traffic.

A STORY.
A subscriber once got a dun through
the postoffice. and it made him mad. He
went to see the editor about it, and the
editor showed him a few duns of his
own--one for paper. one for type. one
for fuel, and several others. "Now,"
said the editor, "I didn't get mad when
these came, because I knew that all I
had to do was to ask several reliable
gentlemen fike you to come and help
me out, and then I could settle all of
them." When the subscriber saw how it
was he relented and renewed. Moral:
Never get vexed when asked to pay
what you owe, for the other fellow 'may
need the money.

TWO PICKPOCKETS
Arrested by Hon. WV. H. B. Croom at
the Union Depot.
Monday morning Ho. W. I-. .
Croom, postmaster at Mfooringsport
and a representatitvc of Caddo in the
General Assembly, had an experience
which falls to the lot of few men. As he
alighted from the railroad coach at the
Union depot, he was crowded and jose
tied by two men in the jam and then
and there he realized that he had been
robbed of his pocketbook. which he had
in his hip pocket, and which contained
$368. Without hesitation ke seized the
two men and called for the police and
right at their feet was the pocketbook
that one of the thieves ltad picked from
his pocket. Patrolman Lawson respond
ed and took the two men to the lockup.
The men registered as Cunningham and
White. The two men were neatly
dressed. Mr. Croom was heartily con
gratulated and is entitled to the highest
commendation in exercising with fore
thought and determination the action
which secured his money and the two
t fleves -who Woold live escaped -
their intended victim been a timid man,
l easily frustrated. The two men will, in
time, serve a term in the penitentiary.
!I
A UNION DEPOT.
There has been considerable talk
about another 'union depot, but there
has been denial by "entlemen in an
thority in railroad circles. However,
" while the denial should be accepted,
there are some people who will hold ia
reservation their opinion and view on
the question of a union depot. The
union depot now in operation is in a
sense filling a long-felt want and two
depots will add to the importance of the
town. In fact, if we could program and
control the railroads we would have-e
"union dapo" for every railroad operate
ed in Shreveport. It is conceded that
such a porgram would be detrimental to
the convenience of the travelers, who
would have to be conveyed or walk
from one "dapo" to another, but think
of the boom at. in and around about
L all the dapos!
