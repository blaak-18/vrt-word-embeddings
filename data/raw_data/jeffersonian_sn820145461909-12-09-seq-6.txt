O LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE O
“BUZZARD” MAKING FRIENDS.
My Dear Friend: —I am compli
menting you on the “Buzzard.” Who
would ever have thought that you
would leave off the frantic flight
from the crowd of bloodthirsty
fanatics, and, gazing into the
ethereal depths of the endless
blue, bring down the familiar
and unsought buzzard and give him
the glamor of poetry, and make the
poor, unhappy one long for the peace
and contentment of your “hero?” I
gave it to Judge True, one of the
most prominent lawyers of
Springfield, and to Dr. Bradley,
one of our prominent physicians,
and they forthwith sent in their
subscriptions to both the weekly
and monthly, through Professor
Hook, of Guthrie, Ky. Don’t
fail to have them a knife with
the picture sent with the sub
scription. These men will talk
you up. True says your piece
on Socialism in the November
number is the greatest thing he
has read, and wants the book
when completed. I wish you
would have me six copies of the
November Magazine sent to me
with charges, I want to send to
some of the prominent men in
the Burley Tobacco Society.
I am sending to Mrs. Watson
a little picture of the way I am
“met” when I come home. My
oldest and youngest sons, Joel
8., Jr., twenty-one years old, and
Walter, six years old. Walter
is my partner in all things, and
crawls in the bed and hugs me
up and makes life worth living.
I am also sending you a picture
I had taken of the last of a van
ishing race—-“7 he Village Black
smith,” Uncle Josh Gardner. He
is the weather prophet, and fa
miliar character at the depot,
and is loved alike by the white
and black population. He told
Dr. Bradley a few days ago, in
response to an inquiry as to
when it would rain: “Doctor,
hit will rain ginst night, shore.”
It did not rain, and the next
morning this is what happened:
(Dr. Bradley:) “Uncle Josh,
I thought you told me it would
shore rain, and I lost all day
from baling hay—”
(Uncle Josh:) Wall, wall,
now, Doctor, dat wus jest a slip,
you know. Susan jest read dat
almanic wrong to me las’ night.”
Aunt Susan is his wife and
hobbles around on her stick.
I had written him up and had
pictures taken to illustrate the
article, but they were not good,
and I will have to have some
more taken. If you want the
article when I get the pictures it
is yours.
With kindest regards to Mrs.
Watson. Durham and Miss Need
ham, and with best wishes for
your success,
Yours truly,
JOEL B. FORT.
Adams, Tenn., Nov. 26, 1 909.
(Would “shore” like to have
the article and photographs.
•By the way, Colonel, why
don’t you run for the Senate?
If Dickinson gets in the race,
some true Southerner must beat him.
He disgraced himself at Gettysburg,
in that cringing, cowardly speech.

HEAD THIS, FOREIGN MIS
SIONARIES!
Dear Mr. Watson:—About twenty
years ago in Georgia, when only a
boy eleven or twelve years old, I be
gan reading your letters and speech
es, and I could understand and ap
preciate them, for I was a “country”
farmer’s son who understood, even
at that age, something of the great
restlessness of that class of people,
and I believed they had cause to
e so.
Your story of the “Roman Plow
boy” aroused in me an ambition
which is still growing, but at the
age of twenty-three I had become
ision freight and passenger agent
of a prominent railroad in that State.
i have continually bought your
JOEL B. FORT
Magazine since you first started in
New York, and for the past eight
months 1 have greatly appreciated
your discussion of “Foreign Mis
ers”, and have many friends in
Dallas, Texas, where I reside, who
1 ave also been interested. I buy
from three to six Magazines every
month and give them to friends to
read. I advise every law student and
young politician to read your Jeffer
sonian and Magazine. .
You are doing more good with
your publications than all the
Gbo. □teffersonum
“Christian Advocates”, “Indexes”,
etc., published in the South, and I
shall be glad to see you open the
eyes of the church people to the fact
that in every city in the South hun
dreds and thousands of our girls are
selling their bodies (and souls) for
the price of food and raiment. Dur
ing the past seven years I have trav
eled considerably throughout the
South and conditions are growing
worse for our sisters and daughters.
In Dallas, Texas, alone hundreds are
working for from $3.50 to SG.SO per
week and have to pay from $14.00
to SIB.OO per month for board
alone. Clothing and shoes, hats,
etc., are very necessary and must be
up-to-date or they can’t obtain nor
hold a position. The result is, scores
of rooming-houses are doing great
business and the saloon comes in for
a share.
I can’t understand how men and
women go to church every Sunday
and contribute so freely to missions
for heathens when their own race at
home are drifting and falling into
degradation. I sincerely hope that
you may live long and prosper in
your work.
Very truly yours,
“A FRIEND.”
WANTS MORE LIGHT.
Dear Sir:—ln recent issues of
your excellent paper you made
two very grave charges, which
should be more fully substan
tiated, as they are of vital im
portance to the white people of
the South.
One was that Cardinal Gib
bons and the Pope had defeated
the proposed suffrage amendment
in Maryland.
The other was that the negro
secret societies were responsible
for much of their devilment, and
particularly for the “bucket
brigade” which files out of every
white man’s kitchen to feed a
lot of lazy bucks. If these things
are so, you should tell the peo
ple about it every week and on
every page.
Very truly,
H. G. EDWARDS.
Abbeville, Louisiana.
Answer.
. Brother Edwards is the editor
of a good and influential paper.
Am glad to learn that he reads
The Jeffersonian.
My statement was that “Car
dinal Gibbons and the negroes”
defeated the disfranchisement in
Maryland. The name of the
Pope was not mentioned in that
connection.
There ought not be need of
any proof that the negroes voted
against being disfranchised. They
always do.
Cardinal Gibbons had taken
such a firm stand against the
amendment that many a Cath
olic must have been influenced
by the position of the head of
the American Catholic hierarchy.
I don’t think any one should
be expected to introduce evi
dence of the fact that Catholics
are the best disciplined church
members to be found in the Oc
cidental world; and that when
Papa, or one of the Cardinals,
tells the faithful what to do, it
is generally done.
Remember what happened to
Blaine after Burchard had of
fended Papa and 'the Cardi
nals, and the Bishops by that
“Rum, Romanism and Rebellion
speech”!
Ever since the faithful sand
bagged Blaine, no politician has
dared to say a word against
Papa and his monstrous impo-
sition.
Just wait for the wagon, Brother
Edwards. As soon as I have finished
*
the Socialist chapters, in the Jef
fersonian monthly, I mean to pitch
into Papa and his hierarchy! They
are going to be put through a
course of sprouts, to be sure.

A SOUTH DOVER.
Dear Sir: —Inclosed find two dol
lars, for which send me your Jeffer
sonian Magazine and Vardaman’s Is
