BEAUTY IS HEALTHI.
I guk yeforthe eneft IWalnut Lake, Ark. June 3. 1900.
thank you for the benefit I received from your advice and the Wine of Cardui u took. In my terrible condition
my life was no pleasure to me at all and I was of no use to anybody. After receiving your advice rnd medicine I com
menced taking it and began immediately to improve. The pains left me and the menses, which came at the correct
tie.e continued three days. I have gained strength and my weight has increased. My hWsband says the medicine has
made me better looking than ever before. Mn. UZZIE MANNtELL
Womanly health means bright eyes, rosy cheeks, clear complexion and elasticity
of form. This is the youth unmeasured by years-the beauty of perfect womanhood.
Beautiful women are happier and get more out of life than their sisters whose faces
indicate suffering. Wine of Cardui made Mrs. Mannell "better looking" and infinitely
happier because it cured her of those terrible pains. But she is no exception.
WINEorJCARDUI
is giving thousands of women health, beauty and freedom from the dragging pains which made their
lives so miserable. Wan faces, haggard eyes and emaciated forms are the results of suffering. What
suffering can compare with the torture of irregilar menstruation, leucorrhoea and falling of the womb I
Beauty flies quickly before the ravages of such disease. The sharp pains of falling of the womb deepen
the crow tracks in the face. Menstrual irregularities rob the eye of its fire and the complexion of its
transparency. Leucorrhoea drains the body of its strength, but Wine of Cardui restores the natural
beauty, brightens the eye, clears the complexion, rounds out the figure and brings back the vigor of
health. Every druggist in this city handles $1.00 bottles of Wine of Cardui.

"Thr' derision erirphasizes anew the
fact that the supreme court. is a decayed
spot ins our ciinistitutiin. In the incorue
tax decision the sulprurme court strippeil
the government )f important powers
which it had possessed for more than
100 years. These decisions clothe it
with powers which, for more than 100
years have lbom denied it. Both decisions
almost justify one in believing that the
court which w as once regarded as the
mainstay of the constitution, has be
come a revolutionary tribunal, engaged
in a work of destruction.
"I know it is fashionable to describe
every man who expresses such senti
ments as an anarchist, but they are
simply the sentiments which the four
minority justices express concerning
the opinion of the other five.
"My opinion is that those who are so 1
intent on breaking down the limitations 1
of the constitution and in teaching the
people to despise it, will rue the (lay,t
for the they are the very class of people
who have appealed to it again arid
again for protection against extreme
radical legislation They cannot con
tinue forever using the constitution to
protect their rights and breaking
through it whenever it suits their pur
poses The great anchor of a popular
government is reverence for established
principles When this is lost the gov
erinent is at the mercy of every storm.

The Bride Hae Smallpox.
Texarkana, Tex., June 5.-Stephen
Ball, jailor of Bowie county at New
Boston, was married Sunday night at
the residence of Sheriff Edwards, to the
latter's sister-in-law, Miss Smithia An
derson. The bride had been indisposed
for several days, but was able to get up
and dress for the ceremony, which took
place in the presence of about 200
guests, nearly one-half of whom were
ladies. The latter, as usual, kissed the
bride who, acting under a physician's
advice, withdrew as soon as possible
from the crowd and sought rest. Now
she is broken out with a fully developed
case of'emallpox and there is much con
sternation in the ranks of the large comr
pany of ladies who embraced and kissed
her.
