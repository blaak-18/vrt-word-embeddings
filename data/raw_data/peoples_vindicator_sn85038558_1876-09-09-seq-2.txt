The Parish Convention.
On Thursday next, September 14th,
will assemnble in this city, the parish
Couvention of the Democratic-Con
servative party.
The duties of this Convention are
of great importance to the whole peo
ple, and we may say that the suncess
of good, honest loeal government de
peods upon its action.
It is well to i'lly understand tlu'
situation before we enter into the
battle-it is wise we should know the
ground before we advance, and we
propose therefore, to be plain and em
phatic in our views and statements,
regarding what we consider the duty'
the delegates owe the people and
the party.
Natchitoches parish, in the first
place, ca s be carried for the Demo
cratic party !
how?
The record of the Radical party,
and the effect of its rule with us, is
against it; the leading Radicals are,
without an exception, men of worth
less character-the whir are rene
gade Democrats, indicte thieves and
known pluhnderers. The colored peo
ple know this well, and have either
joined our party, or held off to see
what we propose to do to better their
condition and ours.
That is the situation-now comes
the remedy, and the Howl In your
parish platform make the issue sharp
and distinct between ourselves and
the Radicals.
State what you propose to do in
no ambiguous terms or well turned
phrases-let it be said in good old
Saxon, which all can understand.
Now this is not all.
You must nominate men for local
office who are COMPETENT, HONEST
and AVAILABLE.
None other can hope to win, and
with one man on the ticket who does
not comprehend and embrace all
three of those requirements, our de
feat is certain-a defeat lasting and
vital.
Delegates, you have in your keep
ing a fearful responsibility. Upon
you rests the liberty, the honor and
the property of your fellow-citizens.
We hope you realize your c,ndi
tion and your responsibility.
With a wise selection of men for
official position, yon insure good gov
vwn'.m.&, colmrient onlsclas, honest
administration of law, and the asnsu
rance of peace to all-you bring by
your action, health and vigor to a
drooping and tottering people.
With an unwise selection, what are
the eonsequences?
We leave that to your imagination
to picture, for pen or tongue is
powerless to write or express the
condition to which we will be re
duced.
Let %s then act patriotically this
time, when every tlhing we have is
at stake, and we are held to such
fearful responsibility.
Come to the Convention forgetting
every thing but the honor and sue
cess of your party and people-de
termined to do nothing that will re
fleet Upon the one or endanger the
othler.
You lose money by not goinog at
oncee to MeCOOK & BRO'SQ., for cheap
Boots, Shoes, HIats, and Cape.
We now must insist that tlhose who
owe.a. uwill come forward and settle
up. Many of our people were unable
during the year to pay fir the paper,
which they were bound to ihave. We
have, by contracting debt, done ont
part of the bargain in carrying the
VINsDCATOr into the honsehold of
every perso who dQsired il I our.
parish-all at oar own expense. (ot
ton and produce are now being har
rested and brought to market, let
every one who owes us a cent come
'forward and pa up. Do this with
ot fail the l at thing. We have
supported youa and now comes your
fatra to support us. "
All persons owing us will pay to
the following gentlemen, to whom
their bills will be forwarded for col
lection, .and who are authorired to
act as our agents. We do this so as
to aseommodate those living at a dis- I

As Conservators,
To show, that without the moral
, support of the Conservative-Demo
cratic party of this State, the enforce
ment of law and the preservation of
order would be, and is impossible;
" we have but to refer to the campaign
- of 1874, when all law was suspended
for several nionths.
Dnring that period we, as a people,
took charge of public affairs; made
and published ourselves responsible
t' for the protection of life and proper
e ty; how well we kept that pledge
can be judged from the fact, that not
a single lawless act occurred during
that memorable winter.
The causes that then required us
to "take charge" of the government
i of our local affairs; to preserve law
and order, exist now to a ten fold'
greater degree.
Our success depends (and success
with as is rehabilitation, defeat death)
upon the impossibility of the Radical
emissaries in our midst being fur
nished a pretext to manqfacture out
rage from-to construct the "bloody
shirt," to flaunt in the face of the
American people, and to "fire the
Northern heart."
We should then he prepared to pre
serve thq peace, to be cool and dletr
mined, to accept every species of
outrage without resorting to violence,
consistent with personal safety and tihe
protection of our homes and families.
We must all be willing and anxious
r to defend those colored people from
violence, who go with us in this work
of redemption-all we hold dear is at
stake ln this contest-life, liberty,
Sand property ; let us, in God's name,
not submit their loss to the folly of
I "an outrage."
"There is a time coming" when
popular vengeance will overtake those
who now but blaster and bully in the
I attempt to force you to a suicidal ae
tion.
We are, in common with our fellow
citizens, engaged in an arduous strng
gle for liberty. Our efforts in their
behalf have been strong, and we are
I proud to aiy, duly appreciated by all.
Let them, therefore, take good heed
, of what we now ay-BnEAR AND RR
TRONG ! When the hour for an ex
pression of popular and public indig
nation arrives, we will be with you
heart and soul.
Our words and advice, depend upon
it, will be no brutumr fulmen, nor will
we, as has been done, fire "with gun
powder." Our cannon shall be in
scribed like those of the old volun
teers-Independence or nothing.
Be watchful-be quiet.

Four million four hnadred and sixty
two thousand two khundred ind tinety
three dollars and six cents is what rad
icalism has cost Natchitoches Parish
alone since 1867.
There as in this parish a total pop.
ulation of about 18,000. This would
he at a cost of two hundred qndfort4j;
seven dollars and nineity cents each, that
radicalism has been sustained here in
the way we name. Tl'iere are about
3000 colored and white voters in the
parish-they have each paid one thou

lars and fifty cents to suestain this
monster radicraism; or one handred
and thirty seven dollare ild erventy
two cents per year each. Think of
these figures ye overburdened, an[

grave aked Do to go with him
the two moved off. As they appraehi
ed the man he began to mount his
horse which was standing at the edge
° of the road : Dobson went directly to
e the road, Dinkgrave leading his horse
i outside the road and about thirty
" yards distant. Dobson states that
when hlie was about fifteen feet from
the man lie threw down a shot gun
and ordered him to stop there (the
man was an entire stranger to Dob.
son and to Dinkgrave), and throwing
his gan, a large doible barrel shot gun
to the right, having halted Dohsoi on
the left, he pulled trigger and Dink
grave, who was trying to place ilis
I horse between himself and the man
received the contents of the gun in
ei the left side, just a4bove the hips, fall
lug at once. The man rode in a slow
walk about forty steps and saw that
)Dinkgrave was mortally wounded and
hearing Dobson say lie is shot through
and through, spurred his horse into a
rapid gait saying, "I am gone," lie
rode furiously up tie road reloading
as he ran. Dobson describes him as
a man of dark complexion, rather
spare made and very cool and rean
f lute with a deep voice and no dis
guise, except long shaggy black whis.
kers, reaching nearly to his eyes. He
knew neither the man nor the horse.
Several persons have seen the man
during the past three days and be was
t furnished with water several times by
l Dinkgrave's cook. Dinkgrave told
Dobson the man had been lying
around his house for two or three days
and thought he meant to kill him.
Some six years ago Dr. Diukgrave
rwas compelled, in self.defense, to kill
a man named Wimberly, who had
many friends, and the impression is
that his death is the result of an old
feud. Prominent Republicans say
this is their supposition.
The tragedy has created much feel
ing, but it is clearly disconnected with
politics. The sheriff with a posse of
armed white men have gone in pur
suit, but with no expectations of cap
tare as the man had two hours the
start.
The murderer was dstessed in a
semi-genteel suit of brown color, wore
' a black slouch hat and was of medium
`height. He did not conceal himself
and was laying down at the time
Dinkgrave turned back. Neither Dob.
son, Dinkgrave nor Beuoit, who cor
roborates Dobson's statement, recog
nized the man. Dinkgrave had im
mediate snrgical assistance, but his
wounds were mortal and he died
within an hour. These particulars
come from witnesses themlselves.

We have grown so accustomed to
u the inspiring threats or rreseuce of
e United States soldiers as a factor in
our elections, that we will be tolera
Iºbly atble to support them the coning
t fall. howsoever much they may ont
o rage the popnlar sense of constito
1 tional right. Setting aside thile shal
liw pretense of Plesident Grant in
attempting to juslif. hrs order to
Secretary Came'ron on the Lord rnso
Intion, which merely declared the,
Spropriety of punishing throught the
court, ofthiseCs comnnitt.d against tle
exercise of popular suffrage, and did
not contemplate the alticipation of
a those ofenses by providing for mili
i tary galrisons within the suspected
States, let us only face the bare fact
that the "soldiers are comning" and
resolve in our minds the most becom
Jing manner of re'ceiving them. The
order is before the country, (and let
I us remark parentlhetically that the
country, which does not emlhrace such
subsidized organs, as the Chicago In
i ter-Ocean, has formed a very emnpatic
opinion of that order) and the troops
will be down on us after a little time.
The desired pretext which Gen.
Grant yearns for will not be long
forthcoming. We have four or five
goivernors de facto and governors pros
pective in the South, and it will not
take any extraordinary exertion of
their political intellects to manufac
ture the coveted excuse. Let us then
understand that they ame coming and
fortify ourselves accordingly for the
advent.
Of course, the intention is, on the
arrival of the troops, to excite local
turmoil and thus afford a quasi occa
sion for the interposition of the Fed
eral arm. There will probably he
some arrests of prominent citizens in
the country immediately preceding
the election. In addition to the gas
tomnary supply of deputy marshals
every apervisor of registration will
be a deputy marshal, with power to
I call in the troops when he, "in his
judgment," shall deem uecessary.
Wholesale arrests at the polls are
therefore not improbable. and it
would hot be at all inconsistent with
the past reerlrd of the Administration
party to incite riots whese troops are
imost convenient, and there and then
proceed to arrest.
All these things and many others
mar be anticipated, and the Conser
vative party must prepare the counter
tactcls. In successfully resisting
the artful designs of the opposition
much will depend upon each individ
ual. Our people must etelse a wise
forbearance even tinder goading pro
vocation. The stake to he played fotr
will be worthy of a great sacrifice of
personal feeling. Let It be remem
bIred that the struggle will be of
short duration, and the exercise of an
ohvious prudence will be crowned
with unqutestionable triumph.
