to learn of two new combines, one of
coal, embracing five companies who
together own approximately 200,000
acres of the richest coal land in
Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Vir
ginia, Kentucky and Ohio, capitalized
at $37,650,000; and one of coke re
presenting 78 of the 81 independent
plants in the Connelleville and Klon
dike fields. This is to be a $65,000,000
merger.

The complete 4 4 restoration of con
fidence” that the people will be fair
prey for a solid eight yeans and more,
is evinced more strikingly by these
actions than even by the unctious
speeches on “prosperity.” Since the
Democrats have rushed pell-mell into
the arms of the stand-patters, there
is no opposition whatever to the will
of the Aid rich-Payne-Dai zell-Cannon-
MacVeigh-Wickersham amalgamation.
Betrayed by its representatives,
bereft of the check that a strong oppo
sition party might exercise, with the
prospect of extortion piled upon
extortion, it looks as if the day of
the mob and the lamp-post might not
be far distant.
The speech by Mr. Bancroft, be
fore the Wisconsin Assembly last
week, was startling in the charge
made against Franklin MacVeigh.
Among other things, he said:
4 4 The present Secretary of the
United States Treasury is a man of
financial ability, because he has suc
ceeded in making $1,000,000 by
cheating the American people with
adulterated foods. For this reason he
was chosen to guard the money of this
country and incidentally override
the rulings of the National Food
Commissioner. ’ ’
Mr. Bancroft also picked up a
bottle of “lemon extract” manu
factured by the MacVeigh company
and alleged that it did not contain a
drop of lemon, but was made almost
entirely of wood alcohol. In this, he
was doubtless entirely correct. The
recent coal tar derivatives give
products Which are indistinguishable
from the natural flavoring of fruits,
and wood spirits, tinctured with
these compounds, is probably what
we get, every time we buy a bottle of
this stuff for household use. And
there is no computing the danger to
health that comes from soda fount
beaverages made up of such flavored
syrups. To say that it is rank
poison, such as a druggist would not

dare sell, masquerading as the
adjunct to a “harmless beaverage” is
not to exaggerate. And a man mak
ing this stuff put at the head of
enforcing the Pure Food and Drug
measure!

raping the little Whitla
boy, were promptly sentenced and as
piomptly sent to the penitentiary,
the man for life and the woman for
25 years. The severity of the sen
tence occasioned astonishment, but to
those who had recently witnessed the
anguish of the missing boy’s father
and mother, seemed not inadequate to
the great offense. Few crimes are
worse than 'kidnaping, even when, as

in this case, the child was not harmed.
In the case of Mrs. Boyle, however, it
appears that she may have been led
into the scheme and in her case a
lighter sentence would have met the
demands of justice. For the man con
cerned, no extenuating circumstance
is revealed, but on the contrary pre
vious crimes seem to have merited
punishment in themselves.
But with kidnaping, the law has
most serious questions to consider,
aside from dealing with individual
guilt; how best to discourage child
stealing by sentences severe enough,
and yet to protect possible victims
from being put to death as a safer
means of escape, in case the kidnapers
fii d themselves in close quarters. Cap
ital punishment clearly would cost
the life of a stolen child, if the kid
naper were to be hanged even if the
child were restored unharmed, and
those who clamor for capital punish
ment surely forget this feature, an
agonizing one to those who waited and
watched and searched for a lost little
one.
Altogether, a life sentence for the
ring-leader seems about the best solu
tion.

cerned, the representatives in Wash
ington are attempting to initiate a
move for the impeachment of the Fed
eral Judge and his confrere, Judge
Phillips, of the Western District of
Missouri. Formal charges covering
alleged acts of 4 4 undue friendship for
the corporations” are to be filed.
The Missouri Legislature has, by the
way, also passed one eminently sane
and progressive measure, as follows:
Section 865. Neither the Supreme
Court nor any courts of appeal shall
reverse or remand any judgment ren
dered in any civil or criminal ease on
any ground unless the court, after a
examination of the entire record, can
affirmatively say that the judgment
of the trial court was for the wrong"
party, and that ’but for the errors
complained of a different judgment
would have been rendered.
How this may operate can not be
foretold, but its clear purpose is the
commendable one of trying- to find
some path through the straight path
to justice through a maze of the eter
nal “technicalities,” which the law
breaker’s clever attorneys are certain
t ) create.
Notwithstanding Missouri, confron
ted with *a deficit in the State treas
ury, Iras seen its legislators vote to
raise their own salaries, and notwith
standing much frittering away of the
time during this last session upon im
material matters, this one act is de
serving of approval. “Barratry” is
one of the things legal ethics ex
pressly forbids, and yet in what worse
form could it flourish than in prolong
ing litigation 'by employing techni
cal subterfuges which retard prompt
termination of cases and often defeat
every dictate of justice 1 ? If, is con
temptible snobbishness on the part of
the bar to belittle the petty shyster
who works up cases of no merit, while
it fawns upon the fat corporation
attorney who is guilty of nothing less
than the most consummate barratry
the world has ever seen. But, with
the legal profession, as most others,

Federal Grand Jury, called to re

ritory and Oklahoma were permitted
to become a State, contains no pro
vision for investigating crimes in the
territories before statehood, where
fore the Federal Court has no juris
diction. This is another purely tech
nical defense, and, as sudh, leads to
the conclusion that none other could
be made and that these men are afraid
of investigation and trial.

country with Philander C. Knox,
while the German press is bitterly
agitated. In both cases, the new tariff
will terminate previously existing
agreements relative to imports, etc.
One German paper significantly says:
“We need not weep over the ter
mination of the agreement, whereby
we were the givers and the United
States the takers. If we must reach
a fresh understanding, it is to be
hoped that we will lay less stress than
hitherto on demonstrating our nat
ional unselfishness. The State is and
must naturally be selfish.”
A tariff war is freely predicted and
these three idiotic believers in pro
tection—France, Germany and the
United States —ought to be brought to
a realization, by some means, of tlheir
stupendous folly. The blind selfish
ness leads only to blind misery on
the part of the common people who
must pay the cost.
