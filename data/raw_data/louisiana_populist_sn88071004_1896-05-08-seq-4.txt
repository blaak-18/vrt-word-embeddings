A Lovtag Cup.
Mrs. ?otter Palmer. president of the
woman's world's fair b, ard, has pre
sented t bcautiful loving cup to Mrs.
Joseph Thompson, president of the
woman's board of the Atlanta exposi
tion. The bond of mutual sympathy
between these women in their great
endeavors was strong to begin with,
and was upon acquaintance made sure
by personal understanding and accord.
The loving cup will always recall to
Mrs. Thompson the visit of the beauti
fur great lady of the west to the Atlanta
exposition, while others looking upon
it will remember happily the evening
of the grand ovation given in her
honor by Mrs. Thompson when the two
women stood side by side, each receiv
ing in her own individual fashion amid
brilliant lights and flowers. The lov
ing cup is simple and elegant. The
design is a Venus riding on a dolphin
and the work is exquisitely chaste and
artistic.

OISR BROTHER'S KEBSI'R.
e- We Caset KE1lepe the Respoeasilbllit
a Try as We.WUL
ie After all, we are our brother's keep
i- ers, though a Cainic societ) has beet
ky d=ny:ig it ever since the first murder.
t (We are put into one another's custody
b, in this world; het, where so many
re things are in doubt. this is unquestion
~. kble. I'p to the present time our notion
to of a custodian has been some sort of
*- jailer. Society really provides no
a other for the weaker brethren. We
mn imprison people whom we find wander
Lg ing about without a home: we imprison
Žr utter poverty; we imprison hopeless
'o misfortune. We may not all of us
think that a very fine thing; but we
id have to draw the line somewhere, and ii
we are brought to book about it, we
Le shrug and ask, What are we to do'
Are we to give tramps a decent lot .
ing? Are we to secure to poverty the
means of livelihood? Are we to succor
misfortune without shutting it up and
putting it to shame"
These questions.which are of our own
, asking, must be of our own answering.
n It is not that misery is growing, but that
it is growing intolerable, if not to the
_ sufferer, then to the witness. We have
t come a certain way toward humanity,
in and it reems to be the parting of tlhe
e ways. One path will lead us onvard to
the light; the other will take u eound
st about, and to the darkness we cat'e out
,d of. In this age man denies the claim
h of humanity with much greater risk to
ie himself than formerly. He is in den
's ger of truly becoming a devit; not the
ie sort with horns and hoofs add forked
as tails, we were poor hanaless fellows at
a- the worst, but the sort of devil who acts
y ipon the belief that every man must
take care of himself.
That is the belief wlbicn .ociety, as a
as whole, acts upon now, as far as it can;
at but personally we are each more or less
ashamed of it, and reject it more or less
" openly. It is the rule of 'usiness, but
it is not the rule of life; b cause it is in
the experience of every liing soul that
men cannot take care of themselves.
It is not yet so apparent to us all that
men must take care if one another;
but in the history of thb race that is the
n st obvious lesson. The stronger
man must take care f I the weaker, as
his jailer, on the old fines, and in con
formity to the ideals if the stone age in I
political economy; o else he must take
care of him as his brother.--("Wbo Are
Our Brethren'" by W. D. Howells, in
the Century.
Its Recowrds of AelsOt Athletes.
If in the preceding events the special
tats came off victorious, the general ath
lete found his opportunity in the pena
tathlon. This consisted of jumping,
tiscus and spear throwing, running and o
wrestling. It required agility, accuracy,
sptAd and strength In harmonious de- I
velopment, and produced, according to
Arlstotle., the "most beautiful athletes."
lumping, of which various kinds were
practiced by the Greeks, appeared in t
the great games as the long jump. c
Figured representations show some- a
times a standing long jump, but more a
frequently a running long jump. In !
both cases the athlete carries in his
hands the halteres (stones shaped some
what like the modern dumb-bell), with 0
wrhich assistance the length of the jump
was materially increased. The dis
tance was marked by a pickax and
measured by a tape-line. The attain
ments of the Greek athletes in this
event-fifty-five feet jumped by Phayl
l isa of Croton, and fifty-two feet by
Ihlonis, recorded without dispute by
reveral ancient authors-render it j
probable that more than a single jump
was involved. As the world's record
for the running long jump in modern
times is only twenty-three feet seven
inches, it has been suggested that the
"hop, step and jump" still practiced by
the Greek youth may have been the
kind of jump which occurred tn the 1
Olympic games. If this were the ase,
the record of Phayllus would not be in
:redible.

Revenues are Short.
Declines in the revenues of high
chur^h dignitaries, caused by the agri
cultural depression in England, are
very serious in some cases. At (Can
terbury the dean receives $3900 instead
of $10,000 and the canons $1950 in
stead of $.5000; at York canons get
$2000 instead of $3600, at Ely the
figures are, dean $6100 instead of $$WOOt
and ganons $2850 instead of $4550; at
Wiachester, dean, $4500 instead of
$8000, canens $2500 instead of $4500:
at Norwich the reduction has been
about 20 per cent and at Rochester 25
per cent. The dean of Salisbury gets
only $2315 and the canons $1155.
Cancer
0! the Face.
Mrs. Laura E. Miis, of Dawson, Ga.,
ays: "A small pimple of a strawberry
color appeared on my cheek; it soon
began to grow rapidly, notwithstand
ing all efforts to check it. My
eye became terribly
inflamed, and was so
swollen that for quite
a while I could not
see. The doctors
said I had Csancer of
the most malignant
type, and after en
hsasting their eforth
without doing me
ay good, they gave
up the case as hopeless. When i
formed that my father had died from
the same disease, they said I must die,
as hereditary Cancer was incurable.
"At this crisis, I was advised to try
.S.SS., and in a short while the Cancer
began to discharge andcontinued todo
so for three months, then it began to
heal. I continued the medicine a while
longer natil the Cancer disappeared en
tirely. This was several years ago and
there has been no return of the disease."
