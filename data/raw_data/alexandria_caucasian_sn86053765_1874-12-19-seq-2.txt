Julius Levin's Christmas
Stock .—This prince of caterers lias
just returned from New Orleans and
has brought up with him the largest
and by far the finest stork of Fam
ily and FancyJJC 1 roceries that has
ever been ottered for sale in Alex
andria. A visit to his Emporium
under the Town Hall |makes one's
mouth water and pocket hook laugh
for very delight. He has the best
flour, breaktast bacon, hams, pigs
feet, piekled tongues; the most
complete stock of the different
kinds of chœse ; the most tempt
ing display of fine french candies,
the most lucious of grapes either by
the box or pound, the very finest
of liquors of all kinds and at all
prices, that has ever been put upon
tho shelves of a'ny store in this
town either before or since the war
He makes a speciality of fine to
bacco and cigars and his ehe wing
tobacco wo know from a fair trial
to be the best in Town. We eould
much more easily tell what Levin
lias not got than to enumerate the
many dainties and substantial» that
he has got.
No one need be at all in doubt
now as to where to go for anything
they may need for the holidays.—
licvin has got everything. He sells
cakes cheaper than the materia)
can be bought for and made at
home.
We do not say~too much when
we assure our readers that they can
lind anything at Levin's that they
could in New Orleans and at a
small advance only on city prices.
Don't forget the place. Under the
Town Hall.
Ferguson & Schnack . —Our en
terprising triends, Messrs Ferguson
& Schnack, corner of Front and
Murray Streets, have displayed
their large stock of Jewelry, toys
etc., ready for Christmas and the
array is sufficient to tempt the
most fastiduous in the Jewelry line
and the littlo folks are all crazy
over the big dolls, horses and car
riages and the thousand and one
attractive toys that so delight them
If Santa Claus buys his toys this
year from Ferguson & Schnack lie
will make some elegant presents to
the little ones. We are writing ti.r
his special benefit and we can
truthfully assure the old gentleman
that he can not. do better than to
go right there and lay in his sup
ply towards which so' many little
eager eyes are now expectiiigly
looking. 1 ii supplying everything
for the children they did not for
get the claims of the older heads
and they have on exhibition frvlect
presents for Mother, Father, Sis
ter or Sweet heart and sell them at
reasonable prices.
As there will be a great rush,
purchasers should pay them a visit
as- early as possible to get the first
choice of their many pretty things.
CREOLE B a LM . Tili S is il llC 'w Med
ioiue for Coughs, Ccids, Cramps &c.,
prepared by Carroll Sc Morgan,
Natchez, Miss., and is doubtless a
very effective remedy for these com
plaints. We have had the pleasure
this week of meeting one of the Pro
prietors who is traveling to intro
duce his remedy, and we solicit for
it a fuir trial. We are always in fa
vor of encouraging home enterprise
and there are virtues in this new
preparation. We hope that it will
meet with a favorable reception at
the hands of oar people. !
THE PLOT DEVELOPED.
When it was well ascertained
by the middle of November that
the honest people had carried the
State by not leas than five thou
sand votes; that they had elected
a handsome majority of the House
of Representatives, ten out of the
eighteen Senators and four of the
six Congressmen running, we were
puzzled to know by what scheme of
fraud and rascality the radicals
could have the barefaced impu
dence to attempt to cheat the peo
ple of a sovereign State ont of the
results of a victory fairly and hon
estly won at the ballot box. The
plot is now sufficiently developed
to leave no doubts as to their inten
tion and the means by which they
expect to carry their purposes into
effect,
The long drawn out count by the
Returning I'oard was to pass away
the time until Congress should have
assembled, as it did on the first
Monday of December. They ex
pect and are now demanding from
Congress an express recognition of
tho Kellogg usurpation, which is
to be used as barrier to any further
discussion of its legitimacy in Un
contests which they all the time in
tended to provoke and which are
now near at hand. Such a recog
nition would set at rest all ques
tions as to the election of 1872, and
relieved of that binden as well as
of the fear of an obstrepulous Con
gress which might seriously em
barass them, Kellogg, Casey & Co.,
would be enabled to turn their at
tention wholly to the. task of set
ting up the new usurpation which
is to lie born on tho first Monday
of January next.
The corrupt Returning Board, a
necessary element in the plot to
overthrow the will of the people,
having delayed the count which
they ought to have made in three
days, until they could delay no Ion
ger have at last been compelled to
show their hands and present us
with a full view of the next step in
this grand p.inarama of fraud, chi
canery and villiany, which is to re
fertile count of the votes of the
contested parishes to the Legishi
tare, after having promulgated the
returns of the parishes in which
there was no contest. This will
give a quorum of the House and a
majority for the radicals. This bo
dy with a radical majority to start
on, will follow the illustrious prece
dents set for it. by its predecessors
and will be careful to always keep
a majority of its own Companions
in infamy ami as it will be a compo
nent part of the Kellogg govern
ment already recognized by Jjbotli
the President and Congress, should
it. pass tho joint resolution which
is to be offered before the Christ
mast holidays—it will, of course,
be sustained by both (irant and
Congress, and if we make any oppo
sit ion we are to be put down as
"rebels "and " Ku-Klux," by the
strong arm of the military and Na
val forces of the United State:*.
With the same old corrupt Leg
islature composed of ignorant ne
groesand unprincipled carpet bag
gers and renegades, with all fear of
impeachment out of the way, and
with the A: my and Navy to put
down the White League, Kellogg
will commission whom he pleases
to the parish offices, and he will
please always to Commission the
same old crew of political buzzards
and insatiable' Jackal who have
lobbed and plundered us to the
verge of bankruptcy and paralized
all industry in the State. Thus is
the sove>eign will of a once free
people, fairly and honestly express
ed by the Constitutional method of
the ballot, to be overthrown by a
band of conspiritors whose head
and front is the drunken knave
who fills the President's chair to
its disgrace aud his everlasting in
famy.
Tiie question presents itself here
that we have heard apon the lips of
every one for some time. " What
are we to do V To that question
there can be but one, answer, and
that answer is comprised in a sin
gle word : flglit.
When, where and how must be
determined ty future develop

prepared, well prepared to go any
where on short notice, and that we
are ready to obey any call. Rapides
is pledged to seat her members in
the Legislature and to install her
parish officers who were fairly
elected as ^very radical in the par
ish admits. The Returning Board
may count them in, but no one of the
iefeated candidates shall have an of
fice in thin pariah, and our mem
bers of the Legislature shall
have their skats.
CHRISTMAS.
Reforo our next Issue Christmas
will have come and gone, and
brought with it to the young and
tlmughtloss its unalloyed pleasures
of firecrackers, drums, big mar
bles, holiday fun and frolic for the
boys; and big dolls, tea sets, candy,
new dresses and the thousand and
one little playthings for the girls,
that make it to girls and boys both
a season of joy aud peace. Santa
Claus will bo the same to them
that he has been to the generations
of bright eyes and smiling faces
since the time when first the little
ones borrowed mama's stockings
papa's socks to hang on the bed
post or fasten to tho mantel where
Kriss Kringle would be sure to see
them as he came down the chimney.
The world may go forward or back
ward, times may be hard or flush
"grim visaged war" may stalk
forth in all his ugliness or he may
have "smoothed his wrinkled front"
and bo as "smiling as a basket of
chips—will some one. pleas« tell us
why a basket of chips is always
smiling?—and it is all the same to
the little folks. Christraas'is Christ
mas and as''it comeslmtonce a year
they must have their annual visit,
from Santa Claus and must bo mer
ry and light hearted. Ilow enger
their anticipations T How vivid
their descriptions of the wealth of
toys that Santa Clans is to bring
them, beside which they would
scoff at the riches of the Indies and
thrust aside the laurels of the con
qucror? How sweet their prattle
is when they go to bed in feverish
anxiety Christmas eve 'I and how
delighted they are the next morn
ing to see their socks and stock
ings all sticking out in lumps and
lull up to the brim I Cod bless the
little ones and send them a Merry
Christmas !
For the youth and the young
miss Christmas has its pleasures
as well as for the younger and so
berer heads. Christmas trees, par
ties, nice presents from parents, a
neck tie worked by sweet and fair
lingers or a pair of slippers em
broidered by her whose pure and
sacred presenceyet. lingers in every
thread or some other trillle from
his sweet heart makes Christmas
a happy day for ye youthful swain.
A book from "Willie," whose man
ly fonn is engraved on every page,
to be seen by her only and whose
name on the fly leaf represents to
her all that is noble, good and true,
or a ring from Father and some to
ken ot love from Mother enshrines
Christmas in tho heart of ye lovely
maid as a day to bo looked forward
to and remembered well when
passed.
And what has Christmas for us
old folks burdened with the cares
of the world and "troubled about
many things V It has peace, free
dom from business and care and
gives us pleasure for a day any how.
It has big tat turke.ys with the
concomitants that go to make up a
feast; it has f ggnog in the morning
and hot apple toddy at night; it
has its rousing fires with wife in
one corner ami hubby in the other
and the children playingon the rug
and it has, or ought to have if we
have a clear conscience "that peace
that passeth all understanding" for
one day out of the throe hundred
and sixty-five.
Let us then banish care, brighten
up our countenances, get out our
good clothes, forget all about the

R. P. ITiintcr. Knq., Fditor Caucasian:—
Dear Sir —While in New Or
leans, my attention was called to
tho case of the United States vsonr
Colfax friends. I had consultations
with both Mr. Marr and Mr. Whit
fiker, and learned that the case had
been set for March. Mr. Marr is
anxious to go on to Washington
and argue the case, but says lie
cannot afford to go unless his ex
penses are paid. He asks no fee or
reward for his services, but only
that lie bo furnished with funds to
carry him to Washington and ena
ble h.m to live there as a gentle
m an, and a representative of the
people in so important a case,
should live while in attendance up
on the Court.
Mr. Whitaker has all the facts,
and is willing to superintend and
put them in shape, if a stenograph
er is employed for that purpose.—
Roth these ^eut leinen are deeply
interested; and I do not think the
importance of the Colfax case can
be overestimated by our people, not
only as affecting Us personalty, and
tor our immediate friends, but as
affecting the whole country.
Indeed it is the case of the South,
involving as it does the entire doc
trine of Centralization and States
Rights'; settling the question as to
how far the United States may in
terfere to arrest and punish citi
zens of a State for infractions of the
law which were punishable by the
State through its ow'n Courts, No
more important question has been
presented to our highest tribunal
since the close of the war. And it
is of the first importance that we
should be ably represented in the
matter. Unless wo take some ac
tion the case may go against us for
want of an advocate. No better or
abler man could represent us than
R. H. Marr, and I know that you
will feel the iinpiytaucc of at once
calling the attention of our people
to this matter. The Democrat, too,
will join iu the good work.
I Mould suggest that a meeting
be called and a committee appoint
ed to wait upou our merchants in
this their flush and busy season—
and upon the indicted porsons, to
strain a point ami give something.
And indeed upon every one iu the
community, for we are all concern
ed. And let us raise as near #1000
as possible. It ought to be fully
that. It might be sufficient to call
attention to the case and request
contributions to be sent in. Surely
our people only want tho matter
brought to their notice. Mr. Marr
informed ine that he had received
$01.00. No time should be lost, but
immediate steps taken.
fours Truly,
JAMES JEFFRIES.
C hristmas P resents .—Christ
mas is a time when every one wish
es to make presents to those who
are best loved. In many cases the
elegance and value of the present
is a token of how much the recip
ient is held in the esteem of the
donor. It is not always possible
to find just what one desires for an
elegant present and we feel that we
are doing those who propose mak
ing such presents a favor by in
forming them that Dr. Henry St.
John, has just returned from New
Orleans with a charming stock of
beautiful Rooks, Toilet Sets, Writ
ing Desks, Elegant China Ware,
Toys and Dolls and in fact, every
thing suitable for the occasion.—
The Doctor makes a speciality of
keeping only the very best of eve
ry thing and what lie sells io so
guaranteed.
Examine his collection of Christ
inas presents before buying else
where.
Ki^ We are indebted to a kind
triend for bending us the lines—
"That Day of the Election," which
were written by a young gentle
m au from the Emerald Isle now on
i,j 8 plantation as a laborer. His
attainments fits him fora more ex
jalted position, but it is no disgrace

THE RETURNING BOAKD.
The Dciolo Bnalnc,«.
Anderson Did Not Com* to the Front
welts kenner & 0abanave apprehensive.
[From tlio N. O. IJulletin, oft1io13th.]
The Returning Board Was called
to order at half past 11 o'clock, all
members present but Anderson.
Wells said that urgent business re
quired his attention, and theieforc
lie was constrained to adjourn the
meeting uutil Sunday at 10 o'clock
Sunday, he said, wns not exactly
the kind of day on which Returning
Board business ought to be trans
acted, but he supposed none of the
members would object to meeting in
formally and considering the busi
ness or questions which would come
before them in order Monday.
No objection to a Sabbath meeting
baing made—nono cf the members
having previou Sunday school or
church engagements to fulfill—the
Board stood adjourned.
This important business dodge on
the part of Wells is altogether too
attenuated. He is conscious of hav
ing perpetrated a great and serious
wrong on the people, by his ruling
iu the case of DcSoto parish, and be
came to the front this morning with
a bosom overflowing with npprelieu
sion. Anderson was no where to be
seen, and it is presumalbe that be
too felt that the part which be play
ed in the DeSoto business was calcu
lated to elevate him—but not in the
affections of Lonisianians. Casanave
and Kenner acquiesced in Well's pro
position to adjourn, and it looked as
though they were a little enger to
get away. They can't feel satisfied
'•r comfortable about that DeSoto
business.

Washington , Dec. 12.— In the dis
tribution of B tlie President's message
among the various committees of the
House on V\ edfiesday, the portion of
it referring to the troubles in Arkan
sas was referred to the select commit
tee a ready existing on that subject ;
and that portion of the message re
lating to the troubles in Louisiana,
and the Southern States,'' excepting
Arkansas, was referred to a select
committee of seven, to be appointed
by the Speaker.
The committee bas not yet been
appointed. It is very probable that
after it has been appointed and or
ganized, it will proceed to take testi
mony through sub-committees or
otherwise, in relation to the disturb
ed condition of afiairs in Mississippi
and Louisiana. Of course any an
nouncement of what has be«n or
what has not been determined is pre
mature and unauthorized, >o long as
the committee itself is not actually
in existence.
President Grant is quoted as say
ing : "If further troubles occur in
Louisiana, he will Rend some one
there who will bur»." He is said to
have in view for this business either
Genrt-al Sheridan or General Terry.
W ashington , Dec. 12. —Governor
Throckmorton, of Texas, is here.
The contest for Judge Durell's
