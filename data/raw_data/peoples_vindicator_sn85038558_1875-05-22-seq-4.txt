WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
-
Illustrated by a corps ofthe best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the (lay.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical pajpe of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satiety the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recoguized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown 'into its
present shape on its intrinsic mrita, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnis!h illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, ThoW Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Ta f, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departmeuts Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
hnapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers In the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg.
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
Trans f" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos.
sessing the remarkable qualities of YVI
soLa BITTERs in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.

with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to D. . J. WALKER'S VIryiAa
BITTERS, as they will speedily remove
! the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and genterally restoring the healthy fuma
