The Gold Standard Helps Only the
the East and Europe. to
ch
The Constitution has been con- of
tending that so far as the interest er
of the great mass of the people of by
this country are concerned, the tr;
single silver standard would be be
more beneficial than the single le
gold standard. We have not ad- en
vocated, nor do we now advocate, sa
the single silver standard, but we ar
have maintained, and we think we ty
have very clearly shown that if h
the remonetization of silver result- at
ed in a premium on gold the ma- w
terial and productive interest of di
this country would be in a vastly al
better condition than they now are at
or than they are ever likely to be of
under the single gold stanidard.
It is both surprising and grati- tl
fying to find that The London tl
Statist, the foremost financial jour- st
nal of the world's financial center,
agrees with The Constitution in tl
this matter. It is surprising, be- tl
cause The Statist is a warm and an it
eager organ of gold monometalism. o'
The editor nevertheless, sees two p
sides to the question, and, in dis- a
cussing the recommendations of r,
Mr. Cleveland for a five hundred o
million bond issue, he refers to a a
possibility of a premium on gold. 11
Although the declarations of the a
Statist were cabled to the New e
York newspapers through the me
dium of the Associated Press, all r
that portion relating to the results t
of a premium on gold was care- i
fully suppressed in the columns of t
those great dailies which belong, t
body and soul, tothe money sharks. 1
We print below what the Statist 4
says on this important matter, and I
commend it to the careful atten
tion of our readers:
If gold is demonetized it is per
fectly clear that there will be a
greater transfer of property from
the capitalist and lending classes to
the producing and borrowing class
es. This would be of immense ad
vantage to the west and south, and
would prove a serious loss to the
eastern states and to Europe.
Of course a great country like
the United States adopting a silver
standard would have great mSAu
ence on the whole of the world,
and silver would undoubtedly rise,
but it would be long before it
reached 60 pence. The great re
duction of debts all over the Unit
ed States by a fall to silver would
give the farming and producing
classes generally a sense of free
dom and prosperity which they
have not had for many years, and
would probably give a great stim
5 ulus to production. If silver did
i not rise much for a while, Ameri
o can wheat, cotton, pork, etc., would
compete with the produce of other
m countries at a very great advant
-. age, and there would be probably
a very rapid and great growth of
ry exports and at the beginning an
g. era of great prosperity.
On the other hand, t lending
and creditor lasses would suffer,
a but their alosses would not affect
1. production to anything like the
same extent as the gams of the
- debtors sad producers would do.
in Further ther would be a very se
rious fall in Mecurities, which would
cd in the United States a in Europe.
S If Congres refuses legislation,
then gold would go to a premium,
S-but probably not high. The ten
dency would still be to benefit
debtoraand producers, and would
at injure capitalists and lenders, while
production and exports would he
in stimulated, .though not to a great
of extsat.
at Thirdly, if the mints were open
r-ed for free coinage, which would
tead to make the gold premium
Shigher still, the premium would
h not e very high, uad the reduc~
of tioa d the debt ad loser of capi
his talists would be small compalred
Swith the demometisation of gold.
- Whet the Statist meas here by
a- the "detamaimeatio" of gold is
nmot its demoetatioa by statute~,
bat its temporery denonetisatiof
a by ramol a premium. Ths re
as mark that a premium oa gold will
m. "sta r ok f prapmrty from
the "apitalists and lending classes 1t
to the producing and borrowing ail'
classes" is simply the phraseology as
of the goldbug. It is only anoth- Co
er way of saying that the process
by which pr perty is now being
transferred from the producers and S
borrowers to the capitelists and ne
lending classes would come to an Po
end. It is only another way of to,
saying that the single gold stand- iny
ard does unjustly transfer proper- fri
ty from the producers to the money wit
sharks, and that if the silver stand- to
ard were adopted this transfer ga
would not only cease, but the pro- pa
ducers and borrowers would be ce
able, by means of higher prices wi
and the higher debt-paying power we
of products, to recover a good wi
part of the .substance of which di
they have been unjustly robbed by ha
the operations of the single gold A
standard. ge
The statement of so high an an- by
I thority as the London Statist that de
the silver standard "would be of lic
1 immense advantage to the people w
of the west and south, and would ar
' prove a serious loss to the eastern w
- states and to Europe," is only a fr
f roundabout way of saying that the so
I operations ot the single gold stand
s artd involves an immense lose to the it
people ot the south and west, and Ia
ea corresponding gain to the east- P
Sern states and to Europe. to
Under those circumstances it is
1 not only amazing but absoluhtely a
a disheartening to find newspapers P
in the south not only willing but P
f eager to sacrifice the interest otf
the people who nourish and sap
5. port them to the interest of the
t east and of Europe. We presume
Id that never before in the history of l
.- the world has such a spectacle been
offered for thoughful men to gaze
upon and weep over. The news
papers of the east are practically
m solid in supporting a monetary sys
to tem which robs the producers of
- lthe south and west, and enriches
A| the eastern states and Europe, but
in the south, wherever a newspa
he per is published next door to a
ke bank, or whenever it has official or
or semi-offBcial connection with the
u- administation (which has deserted
d, both its party and its principles.to
Spromote the greed of the east) such
a newspaper will be found advoca
it- ting the continued robbery of the
Id people who'support and maintain it.
ag For many reasons The Constita
e' tion is glad that so high an author
3 ity as The Statist has made this
.. matter so clear. What it calls "a
id transfer.of property" would in re
ri- ality be a retrauster. The trajsfer
ld has already taken place in the
er shape of falling prices and shrink
y ing values, as compared with the
of increased purchasing. power ot
an money ingthe hands of the easteln
capitalists. The retransfer, which
ag would only be a simple act of jns
tie, long delayed, would take place
he by means of higher prices, enlarg
he ed values'anod the low er purchasinag
lo. power of money.
SBut, in the end-nay almost im
Smediately~-this retransfer would
benefit all classes of all sections by
, inereasing business of all kinds, by
m, promoting new investments of all
k- inds and enlarging old ones, and
by restoriag prosperity to all class
ile e sad to all sections. The Statist
be geson to sy that the west and
mat the msath "are perfectly right in
the view that a ehange in the pres
Sent systnem wouldbeneft their ee
tioens of the nation." We go fur.
d ther thin this and coartead that by
o- removing the present depression
t,- e ring properity it will hen
e the people of the whole coun
t , with the xeeption of a fewb
by handred mone shberks in Wall
is street and other portions of the
ite, east,
ion The Constitution prefers the tree
re- uad unlimited coilage of both gpld
ill and silver, but if the east, by set
om ting its ftae against remdal legis
lation, drives the country to the
silver standard, we shall hail that
as the next best remedy.-Atlanta

EDITOR POPULIST :-Please give.
space for these few lines in your
next issue, as I wish for our
Populist friends in ward two
to read this, as I am a Populist
myself, and wish all our Populist
friends, and all friends to help u.1
with prohibition, as f would like
to know what does our poor friends
gain by whiskey being sold in this
parishl What do we get from li
censes, as well as our friend in
ward two? only being molested as
we are down here in wayrd ten,_
where there is a great deal of the
dreadful stuff sold, considering the
hard times and scracity of money.,
And what does our poor people
get only being molested, even
by their friends when they are un.
der the influence ot intoxicating
liquor, and that is what our friends
would get to, were it not that they
are away off where not a drop of
whiskey is sold, but think of us
friends, that are where whiskey is
sold, as we in ward ten, often are.
The case, a distant friend pissing
in front of our doors using profane
l language, and even shooting their
pistols and Winchesters, ani to
take all these events to court, takes
money out of the vicinity, as well
as out of our pockets. And gt
present under the whiskey law, our
t parish collects whiskey license and
t the police jury gets school funds
from some other source, and with
e all the large sum collected . from
e whiskey license and taxes, the po
f lice jury discontinued our schools.
n So let us try some other way than.
I whiskey licenses to get our chpols

Sand quarters now spent for liquor,
and the cause of liquor being sold,
and when our police jury can not
a continue our schools, we can onr
It selves, and have a moralized com
a- mnnity, so that we may see when
a we go to Natchitoches, the jail
or house open and no prisoners to bel
me at the expense of the parish, and
xl let the grass grow on the streets
to in the city of Natchitoohes. Let
b us consider, a large per cent of the
a- criminal cases are caused by liquor;
he let as think of our friends, and even
it. relatives that are in the pen and

. If there was none spld. any one;
he who wished to drink whiskey could
ot send to a city and get a jug and
kn eep it at their homes, and take a

Isr. Anti, would be .less expensive
to the parish, and then we £will
