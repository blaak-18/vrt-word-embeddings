Business Manager of Duckworth’s
paper; but he Is not eligible to mem
bership in the Farmers’ Union; and
I can not understand how an excep
tion, violating the constitution of the
Union, was made in his favor. Per
haps Ladson can “explain” that, just
as Duckworth says he “explained”
how he came to wreck that Neal
Bank.
Now, suppose, Brother New, that
the Jeffersonian had gone after you
as it went after that Union City trio,
would you have remained silent?
Not if you were innocent. I rather
think, however, you won’t hear them
talk back very much. When the
Jeffersonian called upon the Local
Unions to speak out, and express
their opinion about all this, Duck
worth immediately got President
John Lee to write to the Locals, re
questing that they say and do noth
ing,—at least, that is my informa
tion, and it comes pretty straight.
Would you have done that? I
don’t believe you would. Duck
wants to fight me behind closed
doors, where I can’t be heard. In
those secret meetings, the farmers
will be given his explanation, and I
will have no chance to expose its
lack of truth.
Even now he is busy, through
President John Lee, of course, send
ing men around the State to “ex
plain” away that Galveston speech,
and the wreckage of the Neal Bank.
He contends that Ladson borrowed
all the money that went into that
Cuban land deal, and that none of
the officials of the bank were dragged
into it. That isn’t the truth. He
says that, at last, the land has been
sold and a big profit made. What
of it? That doesn’t cancel the fact
that several thousand poor men and
women and children of Atlanta suf
fered bitterly during two long, cold
winters in that semi-mountainous
city, as a result of the violation of
the law which Ladson persuaded the
bank officials to commit. If I pre
vail upon some custodian of trust
funds to misappropriate them, my
moral turpitude is just as black as
that of the men whom I persuade.
Os course, the notes and papers were
in Ladson’s name: the bank offi
cials who were in the deal were not
going to be silly enough to give them
selves away to the other bank offi
cials, who were not in the deal, by
signing the notes. Ladson was sharp
enough to cover what it was neces
sary to cover. Those men had no
right whatever under the bank char
ter, or under the laws of this State,
to send trust funds out of the juris
diction of the State; nor did they
have the right to lend that much
money to any one man. It is made
a penal offense to lend any one man,
even honestly and on good security,
that proportion of a bank’s funds.
be State has for its purpose the pro
tection of depositors and stockhold
ers from just such schemes as Ladson
pulled off.
As to the Ship Subsidy: Duck
worth is claiming that his speech in
Texas was in favor of the “Merchant
Marine,” and that his editorial, de
nouncing “the steal,” applied to the
Ship Subsidy. Why, bless my life!
that is the most impudent attempt
to pull the wool over the eyes of the
farmers that I ever knew anything
about. The Merchant Marine League
is the lineal descendant of Mark
Hanna, the most corrupt Republican
manager this country ever had. Men
who are financing the League are the
rankest Republicans of the country.
They are the high-tariff stand-pat
ters: they are the men whose high
tariff policy is robbing the people of
five million dollars per day, over and
above eight per cent, net profit on
all the capital invested in manufac
turing. Now, the League is scatter
ing literature, and subsidizing papers
and speakers, in the interest of the
Ship Subsidy. This Ship Subsidy,
Duckworth has denounced in his pa
per as “a steal;” but that is what
the American Merchant Marine
League is out after. The resolutions
for which Duckworth made that “en
thusiastic speech,” in the Galveston
Convention, ARE SHIP SUBSIDY
RESOLUTIONS. After they had
passed the Galveston Convention,
The American Flag, (which is the
magazine published by the American
Merchant Marine League,) exulted
over the fact that Mr. Duckworth and
Mr. Jackson had secured their adop
tion. Duckworth and Jackson were
quoted as being in favor of the thing
which the League favors. THE
LEAGUE FAVORS A SHIP SUB
SIDY; AND WHILE THOSE GAL
VESTON RESOLUTIONS DO NOT
USE THE WORD “SUBSIDY,” AT
ALL, THOSE RESOLUTIONS WERE
JUST WHAT THE LEAGUE
WANTED. The League knows
whether or not Duckworth is on their
side in their fight for the Ship Sub
sidy, and the League in its American
Flag magazine gave great praise to
Duckworth and Jackson for their
splendid work in getting the Ship
Subsidy resolutions through the
Galveston Convention.
THREE PAGES IN DUCK
WORTH’S PAPER WERE TAKEN
UP BY A PORTION OF THE
LITERATURE WITH WHICH THE
LEAGUE IS COVERING THE
COUNTRY. T. J. Brook’s name was
signed to it; but all the facts and
figures were those of The American
hTag, the magazine of the League
which is out after a Ship Subsidy.
This three-page article, Duckworth
published at a time when his col
umns were so crowded that HE
COULDN’T GIVE THREE INCHES
OF SPACE TO MEMORIAL RESO
LUTIONS IN FAVOR OF HIS DEAD
UNION BROTHER, T. J. PILCHER,
although the publication of that lov
ing tribute to a deceased Union man
was requested by another member of
the Farmers’ Union. “My dear
brother,” wrote Duck and Bode, “our
paper is a national paper, and these
things” (untimely deaths of promi
nent and faithful F. U. “brothers”)
“are just local affairs.”
