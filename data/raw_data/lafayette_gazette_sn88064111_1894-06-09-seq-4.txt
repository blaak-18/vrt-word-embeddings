The Greatest fledical Discovery
of the Age.
KENNEDY'S
MEDICAL DISCOVERY.
DONALD KENNEDY, of ROXBURY, MASS.,
Has discovered in one of our common
Pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
ddwn to a common Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston. Send postal card for book.
A benefit is always experienced from the
first bottle, and a perfect cure is warranted
when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shodting_ains, like needles passing
through them; the same w:th the Liver or
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts be
ing stopped, and always disappears in a
vweek after taking it. Read the label.
If the stomach is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of it.
Dose,-one tablespoonful in water at bed
time. Sold by all Druggists.

ward of three to four dollars per scalp
The result has been asstohithii.' Men
have discovered that it paid better to
hunt wolves than to vaii" erops, and
several frontier' counties have paid
from three to four thousad dollars a
year'in bounties, the totalIn the state
reaching sixty thousand dollars, with
no appreciable diminution in the coyote
supply. "
This fact puzzled the commissioners
of severai counties until it was dis
covered that farmers were making a
business of raising wolves for the
bounty to be secured by means of wire
fence ericlbsujes with ample burrowing
grounds, the: creatures increase with
marvelous rapidity. The growth of a.
family of kittens can alone be com
pared to them. - -For feed, the cheapest
of meat is sufficient, and as nothing is
required but the scalp in order to draw
a bounty, the carcasses of the killed
wolves are used for sustenance for
those not ready for market The best
sheep that the prairie farmer- can
raise can scarcely be sold for more than
wo dollars To produce several litters
of wolves a year, each member of
which is worth from three to four dol
las exsclusive of skin and careass, is, it
is seen, remunerative.
These wolf raisers also supplement
their home supply by constant hunting.
on the plains. Parties are formed.
which surround creek valleys and
ravines, "beating the brush" with. as
much skill as the.rained. 'ietainer, and
capturing, dead or alive, dorenaof the
lank, gray creatures. Th former go
to swell the cash account Of the hunt
ers and deplete that of the county
treasury, while the latter are added to
the supply on the wolf fai;m.
Probably the most remunerative
hunting is that by means, of half-mile
wires introduced by a New England
sportsman this winter -on the. prairies
of western Kansas. Hitching a team
to each end of a half-mile strand of
wire, it is iragged over the curling
buffalo grass, with a row of sportsmen;
their guns ready for instant use, seat
tered behind it in a long row. The
coyotes, rabbits, fores and prairie dogs,
crouching low in their, fancied security,
are. aroused from their hiding, places
and go scurrying here and there ahead
of the remorseless wire. When the
cavalcade has made a half-day's prog
ress the wire is swung around and an
other course taken homeward. Parties
have in this way killed as many as a
thousand jack rabbits in a single day
and sent them to the charitable socie
ties of western cities. The harvest of
coyotes has also been large, and the
bounties received' have made good re
turn for the day's amusement-St
Louis Globe-Democrat.

Look for the Bright lays.
A woman with a happy disposition is
far more to a man as a wife than the
woman with a great fortune, for riches
take wings. Worldly prosperity has a
way of altering, and i' once money
vanishes the gloomy individual does
naught but sit down and weep, having
no word of encouragement for the hus
band, on whom the blow falls most
heavily. The happy dispositioned wife
will see a way out of the difficulty or
will accept matters as they are in a
sweet spirit of cheerfulness that en
dows her husband with a new zeal and
eauses him to look upon her as the
guiding star of his existence. If God
has not given you such a disposition
cultivate it as far as possible. It does
pio good to brood over one's troubles.
It doesn't help matters out a bit. Be
on the lookout for bright rays and you
will certainly find them.
The Yarmful Dotted Vell.
The injurious effect on the eyes
cansed by wearing dotted veils is an
old warning which has been sounded
to no purpose, and the fact that ocu
lists are growing rich under this reign
of fashion does not alarm the wearers
of this attractive bit of feminine vani
ty. The dots are larger or smaller,
closer together or farther apart, as
they are more or less becoming, while
the possibility of impaired eyesight is
left entirely out of consideration. It
has been discovered lately that the dots
are not their only harmful quality.
There Is some substance used in stiffen
ing or coloring the net which is pois
onous if it chances to find its way into
the eye.
A Pleasant Entertalament.
A Dickens evening was given lately
at an entertainment for charity. It
consisted of tableaux, as Nell and her
grandfather, the Dombey children on
the seashore, Miss Ilaviham, etc., and
dialogues taken literally from the nov
els. These were Mrs. Nickleby and
Kate with the mad gentleman, Dick
Swiveller and the marchioness, and
David, Mrs. Dick and Miss Trotwood.
This list could be extended almost in
definitely, and, even with the rawest
of amateur actors, the gay fun of some
of these scenes would go well. It is to
be doubted whether Dickens' pathos
might not better be left to trained
actors, or, as was done here, only sug
gested by-tableaux.
Flirting Is Very flad Form.
The man or woman -who will indulge
in the practice of "'flirting" with an
outside party is not worth going out
with or being taken out. It is a
species of bad form that nothing can
excuse, and though there are many
who think it cute to make eyes and re
turn signs made by strangers, feeling
that such attention is'a bit of personal
homage, the outside world judges dif
ferently and one exhibition of that
sort should be enough to wean the re
spect of either man or woman, no mat

A Pretty Picture Frame.
It can be easily and inexpensively
fashioned from cardboard; or, if you
prefer, plain pine wood may take the
place of cardboard. First cover the
mat with fabric chosen from one of
the daintily flowered challies,silkolincs
or china silks. About the frame this
same material is arranged to form a
graceful puff, the fullness being
gathered at both edges. Very tiny
taceks fasten into place the inside full
ness, while the outer gathering is
tacked to the back part of the frame,
a narr.~w tape neatly finishing it.

this st steieAt, I do think that many
dishes re more liple table when- ooked
by steam. In the steam cooker, which
I .have tried and found satisfactory,
there.:is a perfirated disk which fits.
into the kettl: in: three different post
tions;. this divides the space into M
below, 3. below, or j below the -disk,
according to its position. There is also
an extension tin top, much like an or
dinary steame9r, to be used when cook
ing large quantities or many kinds at
once. There is a pipe down one side
of the kettle, through which the super
fluous steam is disdharged into the
stove. No odor from the cooking food
escapes into the room, for the joint be
tween the kettle and cover is sealed
with water.
The steamer is large enough for a
turkey, if the bottom of the tin exten
sion is removed, which oan bedone. For
an average family potatoes and a pud
ding may be cooked in the kettle with
out the tin extension. Dumplings or
a cottage pudding will cook in twenty
minutes it the water in the lower com
partment is boiling when they are
placed in it. Very rich puddings con
taining suet, etc., require more time.
Potatoes will cook in thirty minutes,
and are always nice and meaty. Bread
and raised biscuit are always nice
when cooked by steam, there being ab
solutely no crust at ally but bread
thus cooked should be eaten warm. as
it does not keep moist and tender like
that baked in the ordinaryway. Rice,
oatmeal and the like are cooked to
perfection by steam. You do not have
to stir them to keep them from burn
ing, and every kernel is cooked tender
without losing its shape. The many
things that can be cooked in a steam
cooker, from beef tea to first pre
mium canned fruit, cannot be enumer
ated here; but persons produring a
steam cooker, I am sure, will pro
nounce it a "household convenience."

FOR SOILED CLOTHES.
A Whitewood Hamper That Anyoml Can
,ake at Home.
A wicker hamper is desirable for this
use, as it is so well ventilated, but
where such is not at hand or readily
purchasable, a light box can be made
to answer the purpose of such a wicker
hamper very nicely. Half-inch white
wood or pine is heavy enough to use
for making a box, which should have a
hinged cover, and openings on top,
bottom and all the sides, which may
be rectangular as in the illustration or
they may be made by boring holes in
the sides with an inch bit in the form
of a rectangle or diamond. - Farm

SOME HOME REMEDIES.
Fon a bee stinr, make a paste of
earth and water. Cover the stung
place with it, bind it on and it will
soon give relief.
1VHEt a felon first begins to appear
cut off the end of a lemon, put the fin
ger in it and keep it there as long as it
Ican be borne.
Fon a sore throat, try a frequent
gargle of salt and water. If a little is
swallowed it will allay the irritation,
cleanse the throat and do no harm.
F on stains on the hands nothing is
better than salt moistened with lemon
juice. Rub the spots well with the
mixture, then wash off in clean water.
IT is said that a good remedy for
strengthening and clearing the voice
is to beat the white of an egg with the
juice of a lemon and sweeten it well
with sugar and use as needed.
To CURE round shoulders, sleep per
fectly horizontal-that is, without any
bolster or pillow. T'he habit can easily
be acquired of sleeping thus, and the
round shoulders will soon be straight
ened.
For a cough, boil an ounce of whole
flaxseed in a pint of water, strain and
add a little honey, the juice of two
lemons and an ounce of rock candy.
Stir together and boil a few minutes.
