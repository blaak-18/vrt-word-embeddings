FIRIDAI, AUGUST 9, 1895.
We have heard that the Demo
crats organized a club in Campti
the day we were there, and got 3
members to join it. We Ieat you
a little, boys, but don't despair,
that's enough for officers.
We notice, that by mutual con
sent, J. A. Wayland has severed
his connection with the Coming
Nation. and the Ruskin Co-opera
tive Association. The paper prom
ises to maintain all of its excellent
features that have made it so popu
lar, and we hope it may. We also
wish J. A. Wayland success, and
hope that bhe may continue in the
newspaper field.
Mathis and his clique have been
worrying the Populists of Grant for
i months trying to ram a primary
down their throats, when they
want a convention to nominate a
parish ticket. They have now run
the question itself, into an expen
sive primary to be held Septem- 1
ber 14th next. Verily, schemers f
have long and devious ways.
Messrs. W. L. Shackelford, A.
W. Stewart, P. W. Lofton, J. L.
Fletcher and 0. C. Watson, all of
Grant parish, must feel very chris
tian like since their condemnation
at Fairfield, on July 20th, of this i
poor sinner for advocating the
nonpartism. Maoemen t which they
themselves originated and endorsed i
at Winnfield, April 8th. Needn't
try to worm out of it by saying
you didn't minclude silver in it, for
if nonpartisanism is good for bal.
lot reform, which you said was (
"broader than party lines, more I
sacred than party ties," it would t
certainly be good for the "little" (
silver issue. t
You ihve crossed your own trail,
gentlemen, ad we are sorry for
you, but we warned you in ample
time of your wiry, woolly, young a
leader, who got you into this trou- c
bo, arod who is goingto beyour I

The Democratic plarty has de
pended lt o l'ig upon the 'jnegro race
in this stitte ani the South for an
i-sue or hobby )upon which to ride

that i' can hardly tulrn loose after
it has becomie the laughin;r stock of
the civilized world.
it matters not whether there is
I1any danger, or even any move
mnent of the negroes. Somle oftice
seeker like IMr. Blanchard, has
only to draw upon his ilnagination
for some impossible combination
by which the poor helpless negro
is about to ride into the office he
himself wants, and then proceed to
run the easily deluded people wild
over the impossible probability.
force them to stick to the dear old
party, and elect hiim to a fat office.
We have known stalwart )enmo
crats to lay the plan+ and furnish
the I1money necessary to organize
the Republican party. and put out
a ticket in certain districts, and
then yell themselves hoarse over
the danger of its success, only to
drive all independence out of the
people and force them to support
the "rigular nominee."
People then who know these facts,;
I and we can prove them, will not
be surprised at Mr. Blanchard's
prophecy in his letter to the Edli
tor of the Town Talk the other
day. It is as follows:
"it is noit at all illitobable that a 'om-I
illnation of lRepublicaus in Sou Loull
isiana with Populists in North Loaisiaua
may be formed, and an effort made by
mwh a combination to do in Louisiana
what was accomplished in North Caroli
ns lars November."
Mr. B. by his own admission in
the samno letter is a candidate for
re-election to the U. S. Senate,
and desiring to hold the gold-bug
votes that elected him the last time
he pleads this miserable subterfuge
as an excuse that silver should not
be allowed to enter into State poli
ties.
We do not deem it necessary to
prophesy against Mr. Blanchard's
silly assumptions, but if Mr. Blan
chard will assert that anything in
the nature of such a combination
has been made we will give him
the proper answer in short order.
Democratic Eathkmlasm.
The Enterprise of last week
says of the Democratic Executive
Committee which met the previous
Saturday, "that its proceeding
were harmonious in the extreme,"
(always easy to harmonize a small
crowd you know) "and character
ized by old fashioned Democratic
enthusiasm." Next to Kentucky
our Democrats are noted for that
kind of enthusiam, and it is a pity
that the supply will be cut off
on the first of next January, some
three months before the election.
In the next paragraph we are
told that the committee pulled the
silver question in out of the wet,
and that the Democratic party all
over the State is going to monopo
lize the free silver issue.
We are satisied that this mono
poly will extend fully up to the
meeting of the convention, barring
accidents.
Says further, "No true Demo
erat can object to this plan." Cer- I
tainly not, but wrs'nt there a fine
let of Populists at the New Or
leans silver convention ? No
"true Democrats" there.
In the fourth paragraph we are
infsormed that the aid committee
diseovered and revealed four issues
for democrats in the approaching
campaign-on of them is free sil
ver and the other three is getting
the ofices,
The brilliant paper angely eon
cdndes that a eampaigdn coaduet.d

So Pl )ulist ltt sta Ollit of
the Silver Leagues and Silver I )m
orat of uist quit onkt yino rit with
Popunlist s.
The Atlxandria Town ro ('lk, one
of the big Silver aitators says:
If thel populists of ltrn li, anti hate
any political St e left, they n is ll('eas
heing b,,i',ui'l d hy Pop, ulist lhaders se.',k
tiog pali- offices. n.ul get back to the

ul nist'rationls.
Most of the men who are now
Populists in this State hel (ed the
Town Tlk to elet Grover Cleve-gt,
lInd and Murphy J. Foster, both
of whomt this, ke ten Talk now de
sires help to turn loose, and these
Ten are not a uch fools as to folloStat
Town Talk further in its ayra
tions.
But thet is things th ou houany
others, show that thefor frSilver l
crats in this State are determined
to give the goldbugs choice of
ground on which to make tonly ie ight,
that is, make the tight inside the
inidemorathe ic party.
There isn't ai goldhug in the State
but that is willing that you should
make al the tight for free silver
you want, if you will only make it
inside the Democratic party, they
have no doubt as to the resuit.
That being the case, Poplulists
will '"hands off." We have heg
ged and pleaded and incurred any
anmount of abuse, that the fight
for free silver should he made on
non-partisan lines, so that victory
would be insured byI briainging to
gether the free silver element of
both the old parties, and all the
People's party, but the I)emocrat
ic party, as usnal, is equal to the
emergency, scorns all otters of as
sistance, and pitches into the job
Salone, so Populists will go about
their business. and as usual will be
the only party having a free silver
plank in their platform.
As we have said before, this will
be of considerable advantage to
the Populists as a party, but it
will not advance the cause of silver
from its present status for four
years yet, and we had hoped to
get free coinage and relief for the
suffering masses sooner.
The same influences that kept a
free silver plank out of the plat
form of Kentucky Democrats are
at work in this State, but are four
tunes as powerful, so that there is
aleolutely no hope for a free sil
ier rplank in the I)emocratic plat
form, and democrats can prepare
themselves to vote a goldbug tick
et or a Populist ticket, and the lat
ter will not be a bad thing to do.
---- 4t c- .....
Aeknowledgea the Corm.
In our issue of July 5th, we
warned the Populists of Grant
parish that the same clique in part
that took the negro vote and filled
their ticket with undesirable men
in 1;'92, was again at work to re
peat the operation for 18g6o
When we exposed this trick in
1892, we got all sorts of abuse
from Traylor, (through the Ocala
Demands) who was the arch traitor
and cat's-paw then, and several
good Populists helped him to de
nounce us, and threatened to let
seome terrible cat out of a wallet.
We survived!
Now when we exposed this same
trick that is being engineered for
1896, we were not surprised to find
Mathis, (through the People's De
mands) who is the arch traitor and
eat's-paw in this deal, kicking like
a bhey steer.. And he too, has in
dueed some good Populists to joina
him in kicking, and they, like
Traylor, threaten to turn sone
uglyoests out of a wallet in the
shape of letters, etc., never stop
ping to think that they muat have
beea i bad company when they
got posmson of such bad cats.
