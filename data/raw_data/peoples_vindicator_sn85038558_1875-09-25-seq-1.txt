made her the more inexorable. "All t1

are a4id to have said: "it is disgrace

never be said of nme that I permitted

Donl't ihlsler in the sick room.
When the dloctor cotees to see yon

hie has to linmb every day, and go
down to him if you are trell enough.
When you are sitting.up nights

yourself unncebessary exlmustion.

are manginary. They iray even at
times know best what they need.
If you have a sick friend to whom
you wish to be of use, do not Con
tent yonrself with sendfig her flowers
rnd jelly, but lend her siome of your
picturles to hung in idco of herls, or a
bronze to replace the one at which
she is so tired of staring.
Don't have needless conversations
with the doetor- ontide ofthe lick
roont. Nothing will efcite or irri
tate a nervous patient sooner. If yort
have such conv'ersations, don't tell
the patient that the doctor said
"nothinlg." lie won't believe yone
and lie will imagine the worst pos
sible.
In lifting the sick dt not take thent
by the shoullder and drag them ap on
the pillows, but get some one to help
you. Let one stand on one side of
the patient, the other opposite, theft
join hantds lunder the shoulders and
hips, and lift steadily and ptoumptly
together. This method is easy for
those who lift, and does notPditurb
the one who is liFted.
Do not imagine that yotir duty is

Keeping Poultry in Orchards.-
Sms frnns e m-akt·r- praetlefeto
keel fui;jr .polyly i) .theiir prellards
fronm early spring $rstil cold weather
sets in ; and txler find that it pays fir
so daing, A picket fence should hie
built ut.rnmd the orchard, high enough
to prevent their iing over, with ani
table buildings pl id in one corner
ofi4 s Fs shelter them at night.
Thus situated, the poultry will thrive
and prosper, keeping theuselhes in
good eonditioli, and the oetleaseof
eggs will be greatly atigmeated and
their usefulness enhanced to their
owners at lest, on occannt of the
myriads of insects and worms they
destroy, and which will more than
repay the Cost and labor of building
thle tfene. By keeping4htse eneles
ed in this manner, a large number of
fowls may be retained in the orchard,
and tile continual scratching which is
slone by them, will prove advantage
ous both to the soil and trees thecam
selves.-Colonial Fariner.
