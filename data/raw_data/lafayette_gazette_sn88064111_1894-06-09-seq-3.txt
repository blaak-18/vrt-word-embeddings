Well Done.
As will be seen in the proceedings I
of the last meeting of the Town 1
Council that body has appropriated
$4oo to help pay the teacher for

We dare say that this action of the

The Teacher's InstItute
The people of - the parish of t
Lafayette, especially the teachers,
will be afforded an opportunity to
hear some very instructing and in
teresting addresses by distinguished
educators. The State Teachers'
Institute will meet at the High
School in this town on June z5,
and will,. hold sessions every day
during one week. The instructors
will be prepared to discuss every 4
subject within the field of common
school work. Time will be given I
each day for the answering of ques
tions pertaining to' school work,
and teachers are invited to go to
the Institute prepared to ask ques- I
tions that have come up in the 4
school room. The Gazette hopes I
that our teachers will appreciate I
the importance of attending the i
meetings of the Institute which
offers to them a rare opportunity to
obtain valuable information on
questions pertaining to the work
which they are called upon to do.
A Worthy Executive.
Rayne Ranger.
In the person of Sheriff Isaac A.
Broussard, .the parish of Lafayette
has an executive officer of the true
type. He is a fearless officer, who
looks after the laws of the State, exe
cuting them without fear or favor.
He is the bete soir of the criminals,
for they know that .when he starts
out to make an arrest he is going to
execute his intentions let the conse
quences be what they may. Sheriff
Broussard has a most enviable rep
utation, and'when we sa) that he is
one of the best Sheriffs in tie State,
we pay him a compliment to which
he is justly entitled.

On Wednesday, June 6, at 6:30
p. m. at St. John's Catholic church,

Long before the appointed hour,
the church was filled with friends
and admirers of the young couple.
The bride, who is one of Lafayette's
charming daughters, entered leaning
on her borther's (Mr. Florian Cor
nay) arm, and looked lovely in her
exquisite bridal costume. She was
attended by her sister, Miss E. Cor
nay, who acted as maid of honor.
The groom and his best man, Mr.
Charles Binevenue, awaited the
bridal party at the altar. He is one
of our prominent young business
men and is esteemed and liked
by the whole community.
After the ceremony at the church

A PLEASANT O VTIN.i
Mis-. 1. O Nle.es. a Picis to her
Pupils at si u'I ailis MiIhs..
Careacro has an excellent public
school... Efficient teacbhers bright
children and the united supprt of
the patrons who are jmstly proud Of
the training of the pupilis, ake it
one of the best -schools in this or
any other parish. Mrs. Glenn, the
principal, is an instructress of fine
ability, and the people of Carencro
were indeed fortunate to secure het
services.
The rapid progress, made by the
Carencro schools under her manage
'nent is remarkable. When she
took charge of the school, somen
fifteen months, ago, there was an
attendance of less than twenty and
to-day there are 130 pupils en
rolled. The pupils are all devoted
to her and the parents, who appre
ciate her zeal and ability, would
part with her with regret. "
As customary during the last days
of the session, Mrs. Glenn gave a
picnic to her pupils last Wednesday
at the Beau Basin Springs. Many
of the prominent ladies and gentle
men of the neighborhood were there
and assisted her in making all the
children and invited guests enjoy
themselves. Various games of in
nocent pleasure were played by the
gay little boys and girls. There
were no exercises, recitations or
speeches to prevent the little ones
from having a good time. The
older ones also spent a most enjoy
able day. The laughing and romp
ing of the little children were enough
to make the most sedate feel like
joining in the festivites. Of course
a good dinner was spread. A pic
nic in Lafayette without a good din
ner would not be picnic. Mrs.
Glenn and her assistants, Mmes. J.
M. Jones, Onezime Breaux, Anatole
Breaux, Latour, Romain Frances,
Melancon, Tiahan, Breaux, Misses
Jones, were untiring in their efforts
to see that no one -'got left" and
and if any one failed to be provided
for it was certainly not through any
fault of theirs.
Among those present were the
following gentlemen, all staunch
friends of public education: Dr. F.
W. Courtney, Messrs J. M. Jones.
Superintendent H. E. Toll, F. A.
Broussard, Pierre J. Mouton, Dr. D.
T. Courtney, Prof. Chas. Heichel
helm and others.
Such good cheer prevailed
throughout the day and so sociable
were the people that the occasion
seemed like a large family reunion.
lafayette Public School.
To our friends and the p.,blic.
No less than fifty children have been
refused admittance into our school
since the first of January last, for
lack of seating capacity and it be
hooves everyone interested in public
education to see that so unfortunate
a state of affairs shall no longer"
exist in this community. We must
and shall hate more room for the
accommodation of pupils, with this
purpose in view, our school children
will give a grand exhibition next
Thursday night, at Falk's Hall at
8 o'clock sharp, and we most earn
estly ask for the children's presence
and your hearty cooperation in a
matter so vitally connected with the
social and material prosperity
of our town and country.
Several kind ladies have undertaken
to dispense ice cream, lemonade,
cake, etc., in aid of the cause and
these refreshments will be served
after the entertainment. Last year
our Little Diamond exhibition netted
$ to which was applied in aid of
the High School now in successful
operation. We feel confident that
our entertainment this year will far
surpass any previous effort both as
to merit and financial success.
Fee s5 cents, children under twelve
z$ cents. Mr. Falk has agreed to
permit us Soo seats. Come one,
come all, and enjoy yourselves.

Fight in the House Over the Stan=
day Law.
Baton Rouge- La., June 4.-.-The House
was given up to misrule to-day, and for
three hours the members filibustered to
their heart's content. The contest was
upon the disposition of House bill No. go,
by Mr. Mouton, repealing the Sunday law,
and which had received tlKe unfavorable
consideration of the judiciary. committee.
.The bill came up, and Mr. Loret moved
that it be indefinitely postponed, thus pre
ci pitating a conflict between the supporters
of the law and and its opponents. Mr:
Mouton made a strong appeal in behalf of
his bill, which, he said, was indorsed by his
people, and Mr. Sanders spoke against the
bill- He said that the people of thp.State
had !given evidence of the. fact that thej
desired the law; that during the last -three
sessions of the Legislature attempts had
been made to defeat the law.
Mr. Dndenhefer asked if the law had ano
passed the Assembly. and had the Governor
n-t vetoed it. Mr. Sandtets nswered thiat
the Governor was a part of the Legislature.
Mr. Dudenhefer said that he could tell him
why the Governor vetoed the bill, and Mr.
Sanders replied that the gentleman was
wiser than he. The fact became apparetit
that the friends of the Sunday law were in
force, and the opponents began to filibuster
in order to prevent the bill from dying then
and there. The yeas and nays were called;
and then Mr. Michel moved a call of the
House,. which showed sixty members pres
ent. Mr. O'Neill moved that the whole
subject be laid on the table. The point of
order was raised by Mr. Bulger that Mr.
O'Neill's motion took precedence. Acting
Speaker Wade decided the point well taken.
Mr. Urinage here moved that the House
adjourn. Mr. Michel added to Mr. Loret's
motion that it be laid over subject to call.
The yeas and nays were called, and the
Speaker decided that the motion and amend
ment were identical. Mr. Michel appealed
from the ruling of the Chair, and the
House sustained the. ruling.: This brought
twenty members to their feet and there was
a chorus of yells for recognition. Mr.
Loret moved that 'he sergeant-at-arms
bring the members absent without leave into
the chamber. The yeas and nays were
called and the Speaker instructed the offi
cial to close the doors. Mr. SanderJ
moved that clerk make a call of the House,
and that no member be allowed to leave
the chamber. The yeas and nays. were
again called, and so the battle waged, until
the previous question was reached and the
bill laid on the table by a vote of 48 to sc0.
Messrs. Loret and Sanders were the cliantr
pions of the Sunday law, and Mr. Michel,
of the Orleans delegation, led the opposition.
There was a splendid display of parliamen=
tary knowledge of dilatory tactics by fne
who took part. There was a strong &r;
deavor by Mr. Michel to force an adjourn=
mnent, and on the occasion an appeal was
made by Mr. Sanders from the decision of
the Chair relative to adjournment, and the
Chair was not sustained. All efforts to ad
journ were defeated, and after exhausting
every available method of delaying actiolr,
the supporters of the Mouton bil were de
feated by a ruling of the Speaker, who com
pelled all members to vote either yes or no
on the previous question. Mr. Mouton
says he will not call up the bill again.
Brother Alpha, of the Viriditator
remarks in the last issue of his
paper: "If a man is worthy of the
office to which he is nominated, we
are favorable toward his election,
whether a battle-scared veterdaii or
not." Our esteemed contempo
rary's "devil" has evidently plaidd
a joke on the editor. He had
probably read of the cruel joke
perpetrated by a witty printer updoi
a Georgia editor who had alluded
to Gen. Gordon as the "'battle
scarred hero," but the next morning
this appeared in his paper: "the
bottle-scarred hero." Needless to
say that the printer lost his jdb2
Victor Hugo's masterpiece, "rtes
Miserables," is perhaps better kndwn
to American readers than aiy other
work of fictio/t written in a foreign
language, and his hold itpon the
popular imagination comes fronm
his large, intense sympathy with
every phase of human life. For
this reasorni miany readeis of the cur

to B O. Flower's thtiighftril and
