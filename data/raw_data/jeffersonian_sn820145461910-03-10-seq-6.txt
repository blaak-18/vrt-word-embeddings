O LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE O
PRIEST-RIDDEN PEOPLE ARE
GROWING INDEPENDENT.
Dear Sir: —A Methodist preacher,
near here, after harrassing his con
gregation for an hour on Foreign
Missions, called for a collection.
Not a red was put in. Preacher got
hot. Said he: .“I know what is the
matter, you all have been reading
after Toni Watson. I have a mind
to call in the Presiding Elder, and
turn some of you out!” M. J. B.
McDonough, Ga., Rt. 2.
Conunent.
What think you of a preacher who
tries to bulldoze his congregation
into giving money to buy “Dear Lit
tle Doras”? And to pay for the
clothes, food, books and tuition of
the foreigners’ children? And to
furnish dentists and gold-leaf to plug
the rotting teeth of Congo niggers?
And to supply hundreds of thousands
of foreigners w r ith medicine, doctors,
surgeons and trained nurses?
If the people of Henry county
have been “reading after Tom Wat
son”, they have only came into pos
session of facts furnished me by the
missionaries themselves.
I don’t dare state anything that is
not capable of proof. T. E. W.
PEOPLE TO BLAME FOR MANY
ABUSES.
Dear Sir:—ln your weekly Jeffer
sonian of February 10, 1910, you
comment on Hon. Samuel Gompers
in regard to the judgment of the
Danbury Hat Company of $222,000.
*****
You say if an insolent employer
of labor should pursue you from
place to place, from city to city, from
State to State, cutting you out from
work, robbing you of the right to
live, you can turn upon him.
Now, sir, I have seen some of that
kind of work on the railroads in the
year of 1894 in the A. R. U. strike.
I know of members being arrested,
put in jail and when let out were
prevented from getting work with
any other railroad company. When
the President, the courts, judges and
most all lawyers were controlled by
the railroad company what show
did a poor man stand against the
whole power, be he ever so honest
and right? He simply stood no
show. Our families could starve or
die. We got no protection, no work,
nor any damages. Why should the
Danbury Hat Company get damages?
Yours truly,
CHAS. G. DAHLGREN.
Polk, Nebraska.
Answer.
Two -wrongs never made a right.
We cannot cast out evil by imitating
it. The thing for each individual to
do is, to stand for the Right.
Our people are to blame for the
situation in which they find them
selves. They made the bed on which
they lie. They elected the men who
passed the laws which grind us.
'Some of the bitterest enemies of new
-reform parties are the victims of the
legislation put upon the common
people by the two old parties. Lots
of voters would remain Republicans
and Democrats, although it means
Black List persecution and hungry
families, than to break away from
the Grand Old Party, and strike
manfully for a new party which will
represent the people. T. E. W.
Have you sent in your pledge of
the number of new subscribers you
will send to The Jeffs in 1910?
I HAVE NO “LITERATURE” ON
ANY QUESTION.
Dear Sir: —Having a paper to
write on the subject, “Is Immigration
a Menace,” I take the liberty and
pleasure of writing you to inquire
if you have an editorial or any arti
cles on the subject. Would be
pleased to have you answer me
through The Jeffersonian or by let
ter.
Thanking you for an early reply,
I am, Yours very truly,
C. V. McCREIGHT.
Indiana, Pa.
(We have not published anything
dealing fully with Immigration.
Speeches have been made in Con
gress, on both sides of nearly every
live issue, and I suggest my friend
write to his Representative, or Sena
tor. The documents are published
at the expense of the people, and the
people are entitled to copies.

ANOTHER LIE NAILED BY MR.
WATSON.
Dear Sir: —As it has been thrown
up to us Watsonians that, during the
Marion Butler campaign, you stump
ed the State of North Carolina for
Marion Butler, and, as a result of
his election, white men were forced
to work under negro bosses, please
answer through The Jeffersonian
and settle the matter, —as it occurred
before my recollection.
T. M. LINDER.
Hazlehurst, Georgia.
Answer.
I never made a speech for Marion
Butler in my life. I have fought
that black-hearted traitor ever since
the fusion deal of 1896. I had noth
ing in the world to do with his elec
tion to the Senate, and made no
speech in North Carolina prior to
1904, when I spoke at Newton in my
own behalf. This, as you know, was
long after the days of Marion But
ler’s domination in North Carolina.
So far from its being true that I
helped Marion Butler to come into
power in North Carolina, one of the
most bitter denunciations that I ever
made of anybody, was made of that
scoundrel in 1896, after his betrayal
of me, and the Populists generally,
in that Presidential campaign. It
was his fusion with the Republicans
that put him in the Senate. I al
ways opposed fusion. T. E. W.
THIS WILL INTEREST WILLIE
UPSHAW.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l notice that
some one has written you relative to
an $8 account which the Golden Age
had charged up to a tired subscriber.
My mother had a similar experience
with this same paper. Some five
years ago my sister, who was then
a student at Monroe College, ordered
the paper sent to my mother’s ad
dress for some six months or a year.
The paper kept coming. Those same
insulting duns came to my mother
that others seemed to have received.
I did not intend for this account to
be paid, and so informed this col
lecting agency in language that was
unmistakable, but my sister sent the
$8 without knowing I did not want
it paid.
But Willie D.’s paper may have
put a joke over on me that hits the
lick below the belt. About five
years ago our friend Willie D. was
offering the girls who would get up
a certain number of subscribers to
The Golden Age free scholarships to
Bessie Tift College. A young lady
who had been there and wished to
return came to me in her campaign
for subscribers. I did not care to
subscribe, as the paper was already
Jeffersonian,
coming to my mother. The girl then
asked me to help her by sending it
to some friend. I gave her a dollar,
and told her to send the paper six
months to a young lady friend -at
Demorest, Georgia. This friend -at
Demorest has a younger sister who
hasn’t yet lost her childish interest
in prying in the “big sister’s” af
fairs. A few days ago she hemmed
me up for a direct answer as to my
responsibility for The Golden Age
ever coming to their home. I ’fessed
up and when I had done so, she in
formed me that this weekly was still
putting in its weakly appearance.
Wont it be one on me to have my
friend receive a dun for some eight
or ten dollars from The Golden Age?
Yours very truly,
J. W. LANDRUM.

IF THIS BOY WERE IN HEATHEN
DOM, THE MISSIONARIES
WOULD TAKE CARE
OF HIM.
Dear Sir: —Is there any chance
for an orphan boy, seven years a lu
natic, and an invalid, subject for the
asylum, to be put some other place?
The Ordinary of Randolph county,
C. C. Taylor, says there is no place
for him. This boy is such a care on
my hands. He is not any relation
to me at all, and his mother and
father are both dead, and he has no
brother or sister to see after him.
Please write me what step to take.
I myself have to work by the day
for my support and my seven little
children. I remain
Yours respectfully,
H. C. SMITH.

for the local churches to assist Mr.
Smith in bearing this burden?

THE JEFFERSONIANS, Thomson, Ga.
torially in his paper the most splen
did eulogy of Jefferson Davis that
has so far been written or spoken
by any one South, or anywhere. If
you didn’t happen to see it, I’d like
to mail you a copy of the Charleston
News and Courier containing it.
He will read those extracts from
the speeches of Toombs, Yancey,
Hill, Stephens, and others, with great
relish. I know it from what I saw
of him in Charleston at the banquet
of the New England Society held in
Charleston on the 22d of December,
where he was the guest of the So
ciety at the invitation of Editor
Hemphill, and other distinguished
Charlestonians.
I am glad to note the evidences of
prosperity in the Jeffersonian Maga
zine, and trust that in the near fu
ture it will have all the clientele
that it so richly deserves.
Sincerely yours,
ALFRED ALDRICH.

enjoyed “those extracts”, just tell
him that they are not “extracts”, but
are the compositions of a red-headed

WHY THOSE SOCIALISTS ARE
AFRAID TO ANSWER.
Boyd Gillespie, *
Truscott, Texas.
Dear Comrade: —The reason the
Appeal does not waste ammunition
on Watson is because his ignorance
of the subject of Socialism is so dense
he is his own best answer. In the
list of men whom he challenges to
defend Socialism from his organ is
Bolton Hall, who is not a Socialist.
The Pathfinder, which he quotes, is
an atheist publication, that' is op-
