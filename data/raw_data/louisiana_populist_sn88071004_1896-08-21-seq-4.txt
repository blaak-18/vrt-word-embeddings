lists.
To Free Silver liemocrats:
Brethren: I have no objtetton
whatever to you agitating the free
silver quest ion-p-lrvided you don't
settle it. It is a good thing to
agitate-not as good as the tariff,
but i: it will serve the samne pIr
pose of keeping the people divided,
it will do. Now I want to give
you Demtocrats a little advice.
Don't you take Sewall off your Na
tional ticket and put lup Ton \'Wat
soil. Watson is a red headed son
of-a-gun. You ti.llows stald by
your party aInl if you have any
union of Foirc-es let it be the kind
the h;awk and c.lilekell has whenl
they coini together. It' Sewall
itohldd get off and the ticket be
Eioisl)osed of Bryan anid Watson
there would be simic :1 stanllpete
a;lnl()ti uS business Iucn that it
would shake tlhe earth and a gsood
part of hell. The Iact is just this.
if those men are elected antI should
have a Congress to back them my
busi ness interests would be ruineld
on eaith and there would be con
siderable of a panic in hell. I
should have to call in mny loans,
close my mortgages, ease il ilrele my
bank reserves, and this would all
cause a money striigenelly and I and
Wall street would create such a
panic as you never saw in your
lives, and times would be harder
than ever.
Now you fellows do as I tell yon ;
stick to Sewall and let the Popu
lists go to bell, I need theis down
here anyway; there are not enough
here for a corporal's guard. If you
do that free silver can't carry andt
you can have all this fun over
again in the next campaign. You
fellows are feoting away your time
anyhow on this silver question.
It would have been dead long ago
it it had not been for the Populist:;
who have said all the time that the:
money question was the main issue
The great trouble with the Popu
lists is they read. But they don't
seem to discriminate between an
ism and an issue. Now tree silve
is an ism but sound money is an
Issue. See I Now what you fel
lows want to do is to keep right
on abusing the Populists. If they
come to you n a' a 'cm surrender
and support Sewall. Sewall is all
right. hIers a National banker, a
railroad king and a millionaire.
Besides tlhat lie's ani Eastern man
anld I can always trust an Eastertr
mait to guard my interests.
You fellows don't want to give
the Populists anything; stick to
year prty and let them mtek to
their ad it will be mws i my
pocket. Don't you ass what your
