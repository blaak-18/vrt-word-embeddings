Hon. William M. Bobbins, of
Jïorth Carolina, delivered the fol
lowing, speech m tl 0 House of
Representatives ott tUe 2-tth of Jan-,
aary last, on Sumnert» latest infa
my, the u Civil Bights Bill." A
gentleman of this country, and old
friend of the àtutlior, requests its
publication in our columns, and as
it fôrms a rare Exception to the
speeches delived iu Congress now
adays, so low of which are worth
republishing, we willingly comply
with the request; Mr. Bobbins
.»aid—
Mr. Speaker—In the discnssion
of this so -called "Civil Rights Bill"
the Representatives of North Oar
oliua have thus tar occupied hut
lit t4*> of the time ot the House, and
myself none at all, as I preferred
to hear fully the advocates of the
measure before giving my views.
■ But a sense of dutf will not permit
me to remain silent longer on a sub
ject so vitally important to the peo
ple of the entire South. The North
ern States, whose people are near
ly all of one race, will be little af
fected by this measure ; and their
Representatives- here, knowing lit
tle of the psaeticsl difficulty of
maintaining free government and
social harmony among a heteroge
neons population like ours, may
think it a. light thing to indulge in
this theoretical and i m-ifnl legis
lation, and thus to thrust a new
Venture into the groat and novel
problem which wo of the South
have to solve. But that spirit of
nÉlity and mutual good will which
•t exist among all the sections
<d .. common destiny, ought to in
duco our Northern countrymen to
hearken with patience and defer
ence» to the protest which cotnes up
agaiiiüt this measure from all those
thirteen States whose welfare it
most deeply concerns, States wb'ch,
it is true, you lately overwhei ued
on the field by your superior num
bers, but whose hetolsm in the
struggle and whose hearing under
defeat entitle them to the respect of
their brave adversaries. So im
portant were those Stntes iu area,
climate, soil ond Resources, that a
dozen yea is ago you declared that
»their coutinuance in the Ifuion was
necessary to the " nation's life," as
you phrased it. 11 that were so,
are not their peace and prosperity
in the Union essentiai to the na
lion's healthy life ? If, by an un
wise polity, you keep that half of
1 he body politic morbid and disor
dered, will not the nation—like my
late constituent« and supporters,
thé* Siamese twins, attyr one was
.pacalyzetl—drag out buta diseay
ed, enfeebled, and miserable exis
tence ?
Whether Congress has the right,
under the Constitution, to enact
auch a, law, (which I do not believe,)
or whether such right-pertains sole
ly to the. States, (which is my opin
ion,) I will not stop to discuss, for
not on'y has that question been
tuny debated already, but even if
the right of Congress to »ass this
bill were undoubted. I should still
oppose it on account of its ruinous
inexpediency. My remarks,wdl be
confined altogether to the detection
and exposure of the ta-Lso political,
aocaal and ethnological principles
upon which this proposed legisla
t'-QS based, and the injurious re
sults necessarily consequent upon
its adoption. It my treatment of

be not duty not true, but to
more error and untruth than
ever been embodied, perhaps in the
same hnmber of English words.
It is a sentiment which may serve
very well, and often has served
well, as the war-cry of revolution
ists, but calm philosophy, ay, plain
common sense, smiles at its absurd
ity. "All men born equal." Why
sir, no two men are born equal, or
ever live to become equal. In face
in form, in fortume, in intellect, in
everything, each man is unlike eve
ry other. Not equality, but infinite
inequality and variety, is the haw
of this universe. It has been said
that " Shakespeare nevér repeats."
Such was the compass of his geni
us, that every effort of his mind
evolved a new idea. Does God
then repeat! No,sir. Bach thought
emanating from the All perfect
mind is a new thought, and each
act a new creation. lie made the
oak to battle with storms, and the
daisy to shelter underneath, the ea
gle to soar above the clouds, and
the mocking-bird to sing in the
thicket. All nature is full of con
trasts and unlikenesses. And not
only does this variety- pertain to
the natural world, but in that high
er realm to which faith poiuts us,
" one star differs from another star
in glory." So that from the grains
of sand and the rocks, upward
through the living*the animate, the
intelligent, the spiritual, the angel
ic existences to the very throne ot
God, all being in one grand chain
of progressive and successive links,
whereof there are no two of them
equal or alike.
The fatatical spirit which threat
ens utterly to dominate this coun
try seeks to reduce everything and
everybody to the plane of medioc
rity and a. common average. It
hates superior excellence. It is a
leveling spirit, leveling downward
and not upward In the eyes of
these so-called universal equality
man uo doubt the forests look de
formed, because the oak, and elm,
and pine overshadow the minor
shrubs, and the starry heavens ap
pear to them imperfect, because Si
rius, and Arcturus, and Aldebaran
shine out proudly eminent among
their little companions. And these
men would think it an improve
in en t if tbey cou 1 d bring down a 11
the trees to the level of the black
jack. amt' aïf llre Stars' to the size of
the North Star. But fortunately
these things are beyond their pow
er, being protected by a constitu
tion which our radical ists and high
er law men cannot, and therefore
do not, violate and trample on.
But there is one thing which these
fanatical levelers might do, and to
be, consistent they ought to do it at
once. Above your head, Mr.
Speaker, I sea the image and pre
sentment of the eagle—rour nation
al emblem. In the name of eqali
ty, sir, I demand what business
has he there? He is a monarch—
the king of birds. He is no tit em
blem lor us in these times—no pro
per representative o f the prevalent
ideal. I suggest that he be torn
down, as the French tore down the
monogram of the Emperor. I)o
you ask me what bird could with
propriety be put In his place Ï The
crow, sir. He is a bird of medium
size, and therefore embodies well
the idea of the levelers. His plum
age is of the fa vor its color, so pop
ular with the dominant party.
[LaugUtenj I will not—because it
would seHb ungracious—carry out
the parallel in its details, and show
how fit an emblem for the times he
tn other respects, such as his
thieving propensities, and the like.
I think what has been

Othë wfite man
white man down to the"
negro ; by providing that the white
mau shall be nothing, have uothiug
and enjoy nothing, unless he sees
to it that the negro shall be, have
and enjoy precisely the same.
Sir, since it is impossible for any
one man to be equal to or like any
other man, is it not more philo
sophical to say that such a thing
can be no proper object of human
effort or human ambitiou f Our
rights are limited by our duties,
and our duties are measured by our
capabilities. "To whom much is
given, of him shall be much re
quired." I lay this down as the
true doctrine—that every man has
the right, and is bound by the du
ty, to fill the sphere and move in
the orbit to which God and natnre
have assigned him, as indicated by
his peculiar natural endowments,
which, being different in each indi
vidual and in each race point out
for each a different part to perform.
If we could change this, and com
pel all to revolve in one and the
same orbit, we should overthrow
eternal laws and reduce the world
back to chaos. •
In speaking of the characteris
tics ot the negro, I do not mean aiy
disrespect to him. I respect ail
men and as the children of St com
mon Father, and I trust I have a
heart to Vish well to all and to do
good to all. But, sir, ttye negro is
not a black white man. He is a
different man, with different tai
en ts, d i fferei it du ties and differen t
rights. In saying this I do not
deny unity of origin and a common
ancestry to the human family. I
believe in these things, because
such seems the plain teaching of
that Book which Southern men
generally rely upon as the embodi
ment of perfect truth.
Do you ask me then whence
sprang the huge dissimilares
which mark the several branches
of this common family ?
That is aquestion which has puz
zled the brains of scientists for
centuries, and it would be
sumptuous in me tr attempt its!
solution. But wean told in the
Books of books that there was ai
period when " the whole world was ?
ol'.onelawgiiage- and one lip" (as
the Hebrew has it), and while they
were engaged iu building a lof'ty :
tower, as a common rallying point, !
for the purpose of preventing their
own disposition, this design of
theirs being opposed to the design
of the Creator, he came down, and!

race at once, of that omnipotent !

out o f the dust of the earth, divided Î
them up into tribes, and nations, 1

specific type, for that great changes
were wrought in man's physical
constitution about that period is
proven by the lact th it previously
men lived nine hundred years,
while ever since then the measure
of their days is three Score years
and ten. But this is a digression,
and this is not the time br place I#
follow up the idea. If we were it;
