SUMNER’S ROTTEN—GET LEA
VITT’S OR KINNARD’S BOOK.
Dear Sir: —I write you for infor
mation as to the best history of
American currency. I have Sum
ner’s, but it is one on the gold stan
dard theory. I think there must be
others that are better. I thought
you would be most likely to know.
Your article on Foreign Missions
is worth the price of the magazine.
Go after them. It is strange to me
why any Christian wants to send our
money off to other countries to edu
cate foreign children when there
are so many neglected at home.
Charity should begin at home I
think. If you will give the above
information I will be ever so much
obliged.

THE DICK BILL.
(Exemption confined to members
of sect or organization whose creed
forbids members to engage in war.
—Editor.)
Dear Sir:-—-Your Political and
Economic Handbook received. I am
pleased with its fund of information.
It is well worth the price. But the
very information I wanted is not in
it, viz.: The section or sections of
the Dick Military Bill, granting ex
emptions from military service on
the ground of religious convictions.
A gentleman told me that it was
his understanding that all religion
ists from eighteen to forty-five, both
clergj 7 and laity, were not exempt
from military duty, unless they be
longed to a denomination whose
tenets forbade participation in civil
affairs, as the Mennonites, or as an
individual he had privately abstain
ed from voting and holding office,
and could make proof of the same.
Here in Texas almost all Chris
tians vote, sit on juries, hold office,
and discharge all of the civil func
tions of government. Many of them
are opposed to capital punishment,
and bearing arms in time of war. Our
State guarantees to every citizen full
liberty of conscience. If he chooses
to remain at home, a law-abiding
citizen, and refrains from all par
ticipation in civil or military mat
ters, the State protects him. If he
chooses to vote and stop, or vote and
sit on juries and stop, or exercises
all civil functions and stop, the State
protects him. In short, the State
protects every man in the conscien
tious discharge of what he conceives
to be his duty.
Not so the Dick bill, if I am cor
rectly informed; hence my anxiety
to see the exception sections of that
bill, if there be any. It overthrows
all State’s rights, as you clearly
show, and now if it overthrows the
rights of conscience as guaranteed
by the States, the people ought to be
fully advised in regard to this mat
ter.
You see the tremendous issues at
stake in event of war, foreign or do
mestic. All of this military prepara
tion must some day find vent in war.
An “armed peace’’ is only an invi
tation to war, the moral preparation
for it.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
After due moral agitation the Civil
War burst on the country in less
than six months. Others likewise.
The next one will come like a thun
der clap. The elements are almost
ready.
Now, my dear sir, if it is not ask
ing too great a favor at your hands,
will you kindly print the exemption
clauses of the Dick bill in your week
ly Jeffersonian, with such comments
as you see proper, for if they are as
handed to me, they are of vital im
portance to every Christian in all
our Southland. I am a reader, with
approval, of both your publications.
Your obedient servant,
GEO. DOUGLAS.

IS A FRUIT TRUST FORMING?
Dear Sir: —I know you are a very
busy man, but I feel called upon to
ask a favor of you. lam enclosing
you a clipping from the Tampa Daily
Tribune of May 15, which includes
some of the work of our Florida
Legislature. As you will find there
in a bill introduced by Humphries,
sent here by Mr. Thomas Palmer
from California. I want you to give
your opinion of this bill. It seems
to me to be the laying of the founda
tion of an orange and citrus fruit
trust.
To more fully explain, Mr. Thos.
Palmer is one of the leading attor
neys of Tampa, and has lately pur
chased a fine grove near here valued
at $20,000 or $30,000, estimated,
and you will notice his name also
appears in the free-pass list in the
“Com.” report in the clipping.
He and a number of the leading
growers from this State are in Cali
fornia, went there to study the plans
of the fruit growers’ exchange of
that State to see what could be done
that would be of benefit to the ci
trus fruit growers of this State.
Now, if those people that own
groves that are estimated to run
high up into the thousands of dol
lars, have a right to complain of
their oppressed condition (that is
their claim, which I am not doubt
ing), then how about the people
here in Florida that are engaged in
other callings who are not backed by
a substantial grove? know of a
lot of truckers that nave to depend
on what they have to plant from
year to year and have to pledge their
promise or land to get seed or fertil
izer to start with, then have to take
chances on the markets just as the
fruit men do. Owing to the drought
of the past two years, a lot of truck
ers lost about all they possessed.
Where will this bill help them if en
acted into law?
Senator Taliaferro’s and Congress
man Frank Clark’s names were in
cluded in a previous issue, but they
are not in this list.
Respectfully,
S. J CROW.

WE ARE UNABLE TO ANSWER.
Dear Sir:—lt is alleged by our
local dealers here that the Farmers’
Union members priced their cotton
to the speculator in 1907 at 12 1-2
Tsl)e
cents, and that said speculator or
dealer accepted the 12 1-2-cent prop
osition, whereupon the Union men
backed down and repriced their pro
duct at 15 cents. What we wish to
know is, did they do it?
This reason is given, I suppose, to
account for the speculators’ stub
born fight against the Union.
Please answer this question in the
Jeffersonian, giving any additional
information you may deem proper,
and greatly oblige,
Your friend,
JOHN H. KEATON.

A MUCH APPRECIATED LETTER.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —Your arti
cles upon Foreign Missions are lead
ing people to understand who the
true missionary is and exposing the
hypocrisy of the assumed saints.
Os course epithets will be hurled
at their exposer, but it is only evi
dence that his shots have hit the
bull’s eye.
We have to expect the hypocrite to
spit his venom.
I wonder if any member of the
missionary coterie has ever read your
last great letter of acceptance, or
your wonderfully fascinating and
beautiful classic, “The Glory that
was Greece.” The heart that is
bursting to convert the foreign
heathen while leaving his home
heathen to stumble into heaven as
they can, might gather an item or
two from such literature to assuage
his anxious soul.
Sincerely,
(MRS.) MARION TODD.

WANTS TO HEAR MORE OF SO
CIALISTS.
Editor Jeffersonian: —I notice in
your July issue a letter from G. W.
Threlkel suggesting a union of re
form forces, and he names bodies of
men, or party organizations, that
could likely be consolidated, the So
cialist party, the Independence party
men, and the Populists.
I see no fundamental political prin
ciple standing in the way of the reali
zation of such suggested “union.”
There are “reasons,” however, that
will prevent such a move from suc
ceeding at present.
While I am not a member of either
organization I say without hesitation
I should be greatly pleased to see the
suggested union of the three parties
an accomplished fact. The Socialist
party men, I am convinced, for I
know them, will pay at present little
or no attention to any overtures for
unity coming from either the Peo
ple’s or the Independence party. The
big men in the Socialist party will
scornfully and contemptuously reject
the suggestion that their party unite
with mere reformers. They, the So
cialist party leaders, will inform you
that they are not reformers, they are
revolutionists. And they will “point
with pride” to their big vote and
your little vote, and tell you that they
are progressive and growing while
you, the Independence and Populist
parties, are reactionary and dying.
No, the Socialist party will not unite
with you—not yet. Most of the rank
and file of the Socialist party really
believe themselves and their party to
be revolutionary. They have yet to
learn that a real revolution, such as
they profess to favor, can neither be
voted nor legislated into existence.
While the real Socialists of this
country look upon the rank and file
of the Socialists party as they do the
rank and file of all other parties, that
is to say, the working class element
of them all, as honest and sincere as
their environment permits, neverthe
less the claim of the Socialist party to
be a revolutionary party is looked up
on as a kind of joke.
To all Populists and other reform
ers sincerely desiring a new national
political organization so constructed
as to include in its membership all
true reformers and who hope to see
the Socialist party included in it I
have this advice: Be patient. Wait
yet a little longer. Another election
or so will take considerable of the
starch out of the Socialist party. The
cheif asset of that organization is its
vote. Have you not heard their fa
vorite slogan, “Look at our vote.”
Watch their vote hereafter; and you
will observe that as their vote de
clines their slogan of a big vote will
be used less frequently, and their
pompous, patronizing attitude assum
ed towards mere reform organizations
will go as their vote goes. Then they
will listen to your suggestions for a
“Union Reform Party.”
If you can convince the Socialist
party that the only hope of increasing
their vote lies in their uniting with
the other reformers, then you are
most likely to get a hearing, and a
favorable one. The Socialist party is
merely a reform party itself, though it
denies it; and the sooner its real
character is understood by the work
ing class the better it will be for all
parties concerned.
These letters from the people dis
cussing the unity question, if not al
ways instructive, are at least interest
ing; and I should be glad to see more
of them. And among the letters pub
lished in The Jeffersonian I should be
glad to see one once in a while from
a Socialist.

THE GOVERNMENT COULD ISSUE
GREENBACKS.
Dear Sir:—Was there a law pre
vious to the Vreeland-Aldrich Act
that gave the President authority to
issue legal tenders in case of emer
gency? You published something in
regard to it about the time the Al
drich bill was up in Congress. If there
is such a law, please give me data.
I am having a dispute with one of
our Senators.

of 1862-3 authorized the issue
