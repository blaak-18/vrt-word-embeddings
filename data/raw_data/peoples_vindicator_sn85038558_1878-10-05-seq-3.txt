Extra Liability to Malarial Infection.
Persons whose blood is thin, digestion
weak and liver sluggish, are extra-liale
to the attacks of malarial disease. The
most trifling exposure may, under such
conditions, infect a system which, if
healthy, wonul resist the minsmatic
taint. The only way to secure immunity
from malaria in localities where it is pre
valent, in to tone and regulate the sys
tem by improving weakened digestion,
enriching the blood, and giving a whole
some impetnus to hiliary secretion. These
results are accomplished by nothing so
effectively as HIostetter's Stomach Bitters,
which long experience has proved to be
the most reliable safeguard against fever
and ague and kindred disorders, as well
as the best remedy for them. The Bit
ters are, nmoreover, an excellent invig
orant of the organs of urinalion, and an
active depurent. eliminating fromn the
blood those acrid impurities which ori
ginate rheumatic ailments.
To Burn and Slay.
The evidence taken hefore E. E. Ham
mett, Magistrnte Ward 3, shows that the
negroes in that Ward were to burn CGin
houses andti kill the white men, women
and children. Some of the principle
conspirators have been arrested and are
now in jail awaiting trial.

when I think I must qnit you, yet the
time has drawn near that I must say
farewell!
