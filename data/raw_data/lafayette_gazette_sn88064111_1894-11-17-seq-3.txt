A local politician, who has the
stuff in him to make a Tammany
Sachem, takes the Democratic de- 1
feat very philosophically. He says
that the recent landslide is a sure
sign that the Democrats will win in 1

the election, says our local prophet,
the Democratic party would, in all
probability, lose the fight at the
next presidential election. Coming
events cast their shadows before.

couple. At the conclusion of the
impressive marriage ceremony of the
Catholic church, members of the
family and a few friends repaired

luck.

of respect for the defeat of its great
namesake for Congress in Ohio.
The aspirants for this valuable prize
are the invincible, "Sampson,"
and the giant rooster, "Nip and
Tuck" of Georgia. An invitation
is extended to everybody.
Four Big Successes.

make good all the advertising claimed for
them, the following four remedies have

Bitters, the great remedy for Liver, Stom
ach and Kidneys. Bucklen's Arnica Salve,
the best in the world, and DI)r. King's New
Life Pills, which are a perfect pill. All
these remedies are guarenteed to do just
what is claimed for them and the dealer
whose name is attached herewith will be
glad to tell you more of them. Sold at
Wm. Clegg'a Drug Store.
A handsome and new bread-cart

Southern Pacific Time Tables.
The Southern Pacific Co. will
issue in a few weeks, the first num
ber of their new publication entitled
"Official Time-tables, of the South
ern Pacific, Atlantic Systenm." This
book will embrace the local time
tables of each division of the road
and of all connecting lines and will
be of value to the traveler. Em
bodied in the publication will be a
description of the towns on the road,
the commercial importance, busi
ness interests, points of interest to
the traveler and to the settler. A
birdseye view of the city or a view
of the principal business street, a
write up of, the advantages each
place possesses and a classified
business directory of the merchants
in each city on the line of the road.
As an advertising medium for the
merchants this work will especially
commend itself and will show to
other places what we have in our
own city. It will be interesting to
the prospective settler andc will show
the progress we have made in our
business enterprises. Mr. J. E.
McDonald, an experienced news
paper man, has this work in charge
for the Southern Pacific Co. and
will be here in a few days and we
trust that our merchants will give
hint such encouragement as this
publication merits.
