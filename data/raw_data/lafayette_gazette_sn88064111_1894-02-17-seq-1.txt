Grimmy, hearing his name men
; t~aed, came to the bedside. and sat up
L. btgging,- with his shaggy-head on- one
side, - as if trying to say: "I' know.
there's something wrong. Can't I- do
anythingl'"
' "Poor GrimmyV" said .Spangles."
L _'You'll be good to himn when Im gone.
Jimmy. and never part with him while
I he Bvees?' -
Grimmy jumped on the bed, and
lieked the old man's - hans ant fae,
and it was a-sduoh as Jimmy could do
to ore hmoveL
"I will, ined good to him and
never part with him, dear master,9'
said Jimmy, "but, oh! what are we to
do when you are gone'" And the poor
lad sobbedpiteously.
"'Be a brave lad, Jimmy. and He who
cares for the sparrows will not forget
either you or GOrbmy. Be always
truthful and honest, " however you
may be tempted to do otherwise, and
whatever you fidd to dq, do it with all
your might. Bear in mind that your
mother is an angel, Jimmy, and I am
going to join her at last. In God's
good time you, too, will join us; think
how happy we shall all be there; and
when tempted to do wrong, just think
that if you do it you may be prevented
from ever coming to us, and God will
help you to do right. You and I and
poor Grimmy have played through
many towns, and tramped for many
miles together; yet we never had an
angry word, whilst we sought to earn
an honest living. Poor old 'Spangles'
is going to leave you, but life is before
you yet, my lad; and although 1 have
not been able to save -much, yet you
will find enough in my bag to bury me
and to give you a start."
He then sank back exhausted, and
while the lad sobbed as if his heart
would break Grimmy howled piteous
ly, and sat up begging in all directions.
During the succeeding night the old 1
man rested more quietly, but had sov
eral severe paroxysms of coughng,
which thoroughly exhausted him; he
was also, at times, delirious, when his
mind seemed to be dwelling among
earlier memories and bygone scenes in
which the name of Annette was fre
quently and fondly mingled.
On the following morning, when the
doctor called again, he was deeply
moved by the intense and unrestrained
grief of the poor lad, who held his dy- I
ing master's hand in his own. whilst '
the lips of the poor old man were feebly
moved in blessing.
Even the faithful dog seemed to feel
that he was losing a dear friend, for
he was restless and uneasy, sat up beg
ging all over the room, and had refuiaed
to eat since his master's illness.
The doctor, however, spoke kindly to
the lad, and when the weeping youth
said: "My dear master was the only
friend I had in .the world," he cheered
him up by saying that he must not
give way, as the future was before him,
and as he had been a good boy God
would not forsake him. "In fact," he
added, "a friend of my own is seeking
such a youth as you, and I shall not fail
to recommend you to him."
"Oh! thank you, sir," said Jimmy,
"you are very kind, but I dare not be
parted from dear Grimmy, as I have
promised master he shall never leave
me, and I have known and loved him
all my life."
"Never mind, my lad," said the doc
tor, "we must find some place. for you
where the doggie can go too; so don't
grieve."
Poor old "Spangles" was fast passing
away, and could now searcely- be said
to be consoeous; but it was affecting to
hear him, as in his delirium he imagined
he- w'as"oina tbrough his performance
with Jimamy and his dog.
"SHoap-la! Houp-lal" he mattered.

:t was blowing a gale, and the air
| was damp and chilling, but dressed n
a thick clothing and with light overcoat
i on, this specimen of the genus home
Seviden~ly cared very little for the of
t feetl of his condnct on the passengers.
.o It was a sudden cold spell in autumn,
and many of the people in the ear
Swere thinly dressed. After awhile,
I rst one passenger; then another, rose
le and found a seat in some less exposed
- location.
d The party of-half a dozen men either
G knew or eared little about the discom.
io forts of others, until some one, in a
tone sufficiently loud to be unmistak
id able, made some comment on the open
ing of windows .and freezing the rest i
of the people out. This was met with
i an insolent arrogance that left no
doubt as to the character of the of
o fenders. As the open windows were
about midway of the car, it was impos
5 sible for all of the passengers to get
n out of the draught. The train man
i was appealed to, but he took no notice
of the matter; also the conductor, but
ar he declined to act. Then a passenger.
n who evidently was aroused to a pitch
to of exasperation, asked to have the win- .
k dows closed, as women, -children and
d delicate men were suffering from the
k cold air. The request was met with
the.most outrageous insults and abuse I
11 and a positive refusal to shut the win-.
d dows on the ground that, at that time
h of the year, no one could take cold
from an open window. i
While there are many people who are
n willing to put themselves on record as
* asserting that fresh air never hurt any
e body, there are many others who know,
from the most disastrous experience, i
that summer draughts and chills are
e among the most exasperating and try
ing of all annoyances in life.
d It would seem as though there might
be some provision for persons. who can
not endure such exposure. A part of
the windows of every car should be
d permanently closed, and notices put up
to that effect; then people who are un
able or unwilling to expose themselves
could take refuge in such situations.
· The fresh-air fiends would probably be
willing to go elsewhere; itnot,authority
should be lodged in the officers of the
train to compel them to vacate those I
seats for the benefit of persons whose
e health and, possibly, life would be
jeopardized by the exposure. i
As it is now, the traveling public is
literally at the mercy of a few incon
esiderate and robust individuals. These
warm-blooded persons are rarely af
fected with any undue amount of 1
thoughtfulness for the health or feel
ings of their fellows. Because they
can endure any amount of breeze, they t
take it for granted that other people
may or, at least, should; and as for Y
them and their house, they show by
their conduct that they intend to as- t
sist them to an acclimating or harden
ing process that they think will be
beneficial, regardless of whether it j
kills of cures them.-N. Y. Ledger.

ANTS BIGGER THAN FOXES. h
t Pliny Could DiLeost Ananlas in the Art b
of Drawl-the_ Long Bow. ri
Pliny, that rare old gossiper, tells, s,
i among other extraordinay stories, that
of the Bactrian method of obtaining
gold. The sandy deserts of Bactiia in k
the days of that historian were, so the a
old man says, literally swarming with f,
ants "slightly bigger than foxes." f
r These gigantic representatives of the ti
genus homenoptera burrowed deeply t
into the sandy wastes, their tunnels 4
and galleries often being hundreds of ic
feet in extent The earth removed
from these burrows was always car- i
ried to the out side and thrown up in of
hills (remember Pliny says this) "cf a 1
s bigness exceeding that of a palace." R
This debris-sand, earth, etc.-was
soon found to be wonderfully rich in
' small nuggets of gold. The danger from s
the ants was greater, however, than to
that from the Indians in the early days it
Iof gold digging in the western United s
States, and many stories are told of i
men who were literally devoured in a c
Sfew moments by the fierce owners of g,
some disturbed burrow. Some observ- al
ing old hunter at last discovered that of
the giant ants slept during the hottest
hours of the day. After that the seek
I ers after the yellow metal only made
their incursions at the proper time,
and then they only stayed long enough th
in the deserts to fill their sacks with pr
the golden sand, which they took home ta
to sift at leisure. With all this pre- de
caution the ants often "swiftly pur- is
sued the fleetest horses, and it was sa
only by using various stratagems that re
the invaders managed to escape alive." vi

FO neas SIa th-Ae.
, There isa oertais speoieasof spider
, which Is -moved by instinct at ettale
, seasopna of -the year to travel, and to
a travel' distances that no one would
. suspect him desirous of covering.
t What, then, is his methods? The
spider select the. right kind of a day,
- one on wnich there is almost a ealm in
the air, rather one when there is just
* the snlightet breeze.
- He crawls up a tree or a flagstaff. or
' a bmlirush. or anything that will give
Shml -a free position. He then. begins
d to emit thei free end of a web frdbI his
n filament bag, and this is so light and
fresh that it floats away in the air and
i, ir carriedalong by the light breezes.
He may emit one hnndred or twc
hundred yards, and every now and
1 then he tries whether there is enough
out and floating to buoy him if he lets
g8o "his grip on the tree or other eleva
i Cion. By a nice system of calculation
a he ascertains just what will buoy him.
e and then, letting go his hold, the fila
ment is borne of by the wind, and he
" himself at the end of it, and in this
way he can travel miles and miles.
SIf he finds himself coming near the
water he pays out monre of his cable,
e and in that way he obtains more float.
'f fingilament to bear him up. If. on
o the contrary, he finds himself going
too high he draws in his cable and I
, descends by lessening the amount of I
floating filament.
If you anchor a pole in a body of I
water. i~aving the pole above the sur- I
face, an'cL put a spider upon it, he wil: 1
exhibit marvellous intelligence by his I
i plans to escape. At first he will spin a s
web and hang to one end while he al- 1
s lows the other to float off in the wind, C
in the hope that it will strike some I
" object.
P Of course, this plan proves a failure,
t but the spider is not discouraged. He
r waits until the wind changes and then i
sends another silken strand floating
Soff in another direction. Another fail
s ure is followed by several .other simi- 1
e lar attempts, until all the points of C
the compass have been tried. F
f But neither the resources nor rea- s
s soning power of the spider have been
tried. He climbs to the top of the pole I
and energetically goes to work to con- s
t strucet a silken balloon. He has not
t hot air with which to inflate it, but he L
1 has the power of making it buoyant. M
When he gets his balloon finished he S
a does not go off on the mere supposition t
that it will carry him, as men often do,
but he fastens it to a guy rope, the a

The Doctor Tells Yon Just Why You Can't tl
and Just What to Do. a
"What is the next most common com- di
plaint among women to melancholia?" -
reflected the doctor. "Well, a good ri
many of them complain of sleepless- T
ness. Of course, that is sometimes an di
accompaniment of real disease, but
there are numerous cases of it in my el
experience where it is a separate and of
distinct ill." m
"Howv do I treat it? Oh! I usually be- di
gin by asking questions. I asked my th
patients whether they have unusual th
worries which they lie awake o' y"
nights to think over. I inquire a,
if they make a practice of going pl
to see exciting plays or reading ex- to
citing books before they seek their er
downy couches. And you have no idea m
how many women regard an evening's U
entertainment as a miserable failure eI
unless it is full of excitement. They ri
go to see their "Second Mrs. Tan- di
querays" or they read their "Heavenly S
Twins" all evening and come to me
the next morning to know why they Si
don't sleep! Why, excitement is as
much a foe to slumber as a guilty con- Ai
science is.
"Then I find out what kind of physical
food they take before going to bed- th
whether it is a harmless cracker or
two or a rest-disturbing 'Velsh rarebit th
or fried oysters. Of course, if they
persist in foolish evening feasts, c
whether material or literary, I can't PC
do anything with them. lint if they ju
assure me that nothing more thrilling as
than Maria Edgeworth's tales and ca
nothing emore indigestible than Graham
crackers form their bedtime banquets, c
I am willing to take them in hand.
"I tell them to take a very hot bath,
or, at least, a hot footbath, before go- he
ing to bed. That will almost invaria- t
bly produce the most deliciously
drowsy sensations. Then I bid them E
open wid~ihdr -windows, for fresh air cc
is a griea' aid to healthy slnmber. be
Then when they are safe abed Icharge th
them not to let their minds think of
anything connected irth the daily w.
routine. I try to make them picture
to themselves long,. even stretches of th
prairie, with the grass slightly brown, as
or the calim of a quiet sea. If-only tdheg w
can get firmly before their minds some lta
quiet, soothing image, they are saved,
and will be asleep before they know it. t
