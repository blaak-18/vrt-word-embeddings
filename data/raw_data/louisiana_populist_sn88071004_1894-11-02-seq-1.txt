I. We demand a national cur
rency, safe, sound and flexible, is
sued by the general government
only, a full legal tender for all debt
public and private, and that with
out the use of banking corpora
tions; a.just, equitable and eflicient
means of distribution, direct to the
people, at a tax not exceeding 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub-treasury plan of the Farm
ers' Alliance, or some better system
also by payments in discharge ot
its obligations for public improve
ments.
a. We demand free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at. the
present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
b. We demand that the amount
of circulating medlium be speedily
increased to not less than $50 per
capita.
c. We demand a graduated in
come tax.
d. We believe that the money
of the country should be kept as
much as possible in the hands of
the people, and hence we demand
that all State and national revenue
shall be limited to the necessary
(penese of the government, eco
nomrically and honestly administer
ed.
e. We demand that postal say
ings banks be established by the 1
government for the safe deposit of
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
-et of the people.
a. The telegraph and telephore,
like the post oeie system, being a 1
neemity for the transportation ot
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the government to the In
terest of te people.
&S The land, including all the
netik resources of wealth, is the
beltage of all the people, and
should not be monoplmred forspee
ulativs purposes, sad alie owner.
ship of land slmMld be prohibited.
All land now held by railroads and
other eorporations in excess of
their actual needs, and all lands
new owned by Salie, shold be re
eabied by the government and
held  actual settlers only.

question figures between these ar
ticles and their values t
The preliminary trial of JohnI
Guyea andl Thos. Kelly, charged
with the assassination of James
Braden, held on Monday and Tues
day, October 22'4 and 23rd, result
ed in the accused being allowed
bond in the sum of six hundred
dollars. The accused gave bond
at once and were released.
The evidence was mostly circum
stantial, but as no one else was
charged with the crime a light bond
was allowed the aecused, awaiting
further developments.
Braden was assassinated on the
night of October 2d, 1894, being
killed almost Instantly while enter.
lng his dwelling boees just after
dark. Shotguns and buck shot
did the work. His succession has
been opened for the benefit of the
Mtate of Louisiana, he being an
alien of Canadian nativity, leaving
no beirs.
Mand, the minor daughter of
Mrs. rah Cook, claims to be an
adopted heir of Bradeu's, and
elaime the inheritance by virtue of
a will made in May, 1802, by said
Braden, while sick in the city of
New Orlesa. The will has not
yet been found. Mrs. Cook also
elaims wages as housekeeper of

opportunity to address both the
executive and campaign commit
tees of the People's patty, jointly,
as well as the citizens. Mr. Cox is
an enthusiastic speaker, handles
his sulbject well and engages the
undivided attentiou of his aud
ience. S.
Mr. Carlisle's reports since last
January will also show that he has
taken in and held in the Treasury
$37,000,000 of greenbacks. That
is, his July report that he has in
the Treasury, and of course has
taken out of circulation, $37,000,
000 of greenbacks in the past six
months. Mr. Carlisle's monthly
report also shows that he has, du
ring the past six months, contract
ed the Treasury notes of 1890 just
$21Jo00,000.
These reports will show that he
has contracted thesilver certificates
over five million dollars during the
last six months.
Thus the Secretary of the Tress- !
ury, despite the calamity in the]
land, a result of a lack of curren- i
cy to hold up the business of the I
country, has contracted the cur- 4
rency each month since Mr. Cleve
land came in, about $15,000,000.
In the face of these fact'thee
Democratic orators tell the people
that Mr. Cleveland is a wise and
conservative statesman, and that he
should be endorsed. They pro
claim that a good time is coming,
aad that is necessary to make the
country bloom as the rose is for the
people to have confidence.
Voters, the country is on the
brink of financial and social diss
terl There is a calamitous storm
coming! Such a policy as is being
pursued by Mr. Cleveland cannot
failtobring disaster and ruin. It
is time every voter was awake to
this fast, and had girded on the ar
mor of reform and was ready for
the battle of ballots that must re- i
sult in a victory for the people and
the ethronmenmt of common sense
in out maticnal sairs, or there will 4
be a revolutioa as re as the son I
shines. The policy being pursued
ationl leads to Lraeaisl dim
ter, ad, cial chaos will follow.
Is tLor an who will essasnt to
sk .and 4ddle while the corn

tVid as yar eob wet.
Beat the Populists Any How.
Said Capt. Myers at Nobleeville
and at Hartford City: "Keep
away from Populist meetings, and
if you can't vote the Demooratic
ticket, for (God's sake vote the Re
publican ticket."
The chairman of the Republican
State Committee of Wisconsin
says: "The present unsettled so
cial and economic conditions make
it necessary that the Populists
shlould be driven out of public life.
The Populists are a dangerous
menace to law and order and good
government * " " I had rath
er see a decent Democrat in the
House than an indecent Populist,
and so far as their principles are
concerned they are all indecent
however agreeable may be their
personality."
We publish the above not that
we care for the dirty slime of these
old parties, but to show that the
two old parties are together in an
attempt to beat the Populists. The
money power owns them, and it
matters not which is elected so the
people are defeated. Now readers
if you are wise enough to take a
hint, you will turn out in full force
on the 6th of November, sad vote
for the People's party.

BY .IZAN TANNER.
I "I a Jackson Democrat," the speaker
cried,
I eally belong to that elss,
"'Tis the truth that ye tell ;" a Paddy
replied,
"Sure a Jack's-son is aither a mule or
an ass."
WHAT THEY BELIEVE.
I believe in high tariff a Democrat cries;
I believe in free trad e cries another;
I believe in tariff for revenue another
replies,
Then all vote the sams ticket together.
The Democratic party is like boarding
house hash,
Made up of odds and ends, a strangely
mingled mash,
Its ingredients or principles wont bear
investigation.
If searched too close, no mortal could
swallow such a ration.
