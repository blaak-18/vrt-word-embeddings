Ancient, latiduiarks und traditions re

relation« revived throughout I lie conn
try. Tlie.jr cbeer the oppressed nn<l
despondent southern people with tlx
promise that tho ImrtlieiM which Imv«
M'i long borne tliciu down uro to In
Jifteil off. For ncurly ten yours, tin
existence or constant npprchmision of
tit i I it ii ry or other interference or re
iircHsion, from without, I iiih fwdsicd the
lust, self government of this people;
Im« deranged their labor nystewis, en
fecbled their productions, hindered the
revival of Irndu irtid commercial enter
prise, pruvented the influx of immigra
tion and capital, mid subjected wie le
comiiiunities to the rule of the ifnpity
ing Ktmnger, who hits wasted llie
fruit« of their labor and eaten up theit
Miibstaiico. It may .be safely allinncd
that the period of reconstruction ha«
vÎHÎtoil lipon the southern plates great
er material losses and injurie» than
reunited from the precH'ditig four
year« of war. The most auspicious
day, for tin; honor and well being of
tho whole country, will lie that in
which tlio gicut ex port-producing
Ktateit are restored to peace and pro
ductive eueigy, by being restored to
their constitutional rights and rela
tions.
Hut our complete deliverance de
pends in no small measure upon I he
wisdom with which ouf.stdvex shall
ulalize past, lessons and coming op
portunities. It is lo be wrought out
by the moral power of our fidelity to
every constitutional trust. If our
present libpc* be fulfilled, their very
fulfilment confronts us with new exig
encies to be well Understood and man
fully met. The new organic m der,
settled by the recent, amend men t s of
the t'edeiiil constilution, will siuml
unaltered ; and the great domestic pro
Idem they impose on us will lie left to
be Workeil out by our nn:iHniftte<J
strengt Ii and ut our own hazard We
may rent assured of success as soon it«
the repeal or judical annulment of all
enforcement laws shall peacefully le
lieve us fluni the harrafcsmcnl; and Ap
prehension of military and oilier coer
cion from without, and from the inter
meddling of mere puliiiujil ad ventuier.<
within. As soon us let alone to adjust
their own iclations, the races will he
brought cleailv lo understand their re
spective destinies, and mutual co-ope
ration and good will will enlist in
working out u common welfare.
Looking to the preponderant num
bers of the white race ; to their con
stantly augment ing relut i ve si i engt It ;
to their great, superiority in experience,
education ami euligliMueut ; to dil
ti util t hat intelligence is a main sup
poit of 'free institutions, we caiinol
doubt that, the belter qualified and
superior portion of the people can,
will and ought to control and admin
ister the domestic governments. Hence
forth, let it he nildeistood of all, that
the political equality of the races is
settled, and the social equality of llie
races is a settled impossibility. I/-;
it. be understood of all, that any or
ganized attempt, on the part of (he
weaker and relatively diminishing race |,
to dominate the domestic governments,
is tho wildest chimera of political in
sanity. Lei each race sot tin down in
final resignation to the lot, to which
the logic.of events has inexorably con
signed it. When the pernicious inter
meddling which has irritated the rela
tions of the races shall cease, the weak
er lace will look with growing conti
dence to us for tho pfotec ion of their
rights; and their fidelity and services
ill the trying periods of the past, their
dependence, and comparai ive helpless
ness, tho demands of humanity and
out own well-being, all impel us to ac
cord tlii-iii justice and beneficence vvit.li
a generous hand. The members of
that race are engaged in an unequal
struggle with poverty and the perilous
responsibilities of it sudden freedom
Their earnings may suttlce to secure a
livelihood for themselves, but they
who were once valuable laborers and
producers are now conti ibutin;c no in

The colored man is on trial before
the eyes of llie vvoild. It is mainly fur
himself to pro vu his race worthy of ily|>I.

In dealing with these questions, wej
are told that, we cannot afford to do!

Telegraph. Lino to Alexandria.
[ From the Slireveport Times ]
Our fellow-citizens -in Kapides
parish are seriously in need of a
swift, and speedy method of com
mnnicatioii with tin« outer world, or
in other words, telegraphic commu
nication with Now Orleans or
Slireveport.
The J own of Alexandria has of
fered to furnish $,1000, or its eqtiiv
ilent, while other towns between
Alexandria and Sh.teveport will un
doubtedly give all proper and ne
ccssary aid.
The establishment of telegraphic
communication between Slireve
port, intermediate towns and AI
examina >vill be of great, and mi
told benefit not only to the citizens
of this city but to every planter
and merchant residing on or near
the line of route. Ouiy recently
private, telegraph lines were estai)
lislied between Minden and Homer,
and Minden and 11astrop and not
WitIiMaiiding the fact, that, the
above named places are far hum
railroad connections, and except
during high wider are entirely de
prived Of coimnuicntéoii with New
Orleans or other Mississippi mails,
merchants and buyers are enabled
to keep conversant with the ruling
prices of staples and piodnee ami
consequently are in a position to
reap benefits that heretofore have
been gathered in by the middleman
or speedIhtor.
Wo feel satisfied, knowing the
many inducements otlered by
Slireveport merchants ami a tlior
ongli knowledge ot the situation of
tlie people Ii ving between Alcxan
Iria and Slireveport, that, through
télégraphié communication a largt
and remunerative trade can be
built tip. As the mal ter stands at
present Alexandri.tiind the wealthy
palish of Kupidos and, indeed, ol
Avoyelles and other parishes are
now dependent upon irregular ar
rivals departures of steamboats for
the iilliug of orders, selling ol col
ten, sugar, etc., and filling of orders
for slocks and supplies, l'y the
means id'a telegraph line, merchants
and ol hers would be appraised of
the ruling figures in.tho iShrcveport
market and conséquent ly (as re
turns could be. more quickly made)
would find it to their advantage to
ship to and order from here lather
than await the, delays and uncer
tainties that usually attend trans
aidions with the Oexconl. <!ity.
We. earnestly trust that the en
fejpiise, in question will soon be
come air fail accompli, and we speak
advisedly when we say that Natchi
toches and Mansfield will give sub
stautial aid in the mutter. Ol
course the smaller towns along the
line of route will be bound to as
sist to a certain extent. Self-inter
est will compel them to identify
|, ll( . mscl V( . s with.such an important
. 1
scfieme.
Tho merehatils of Slireveport,)
knowing the importance, indeed,
we. may say, Ilm necessity of this
measure will speedily assume a
prominent position in the enlor
priso whenever they are convinced
that, lli<' business men and others
interested in the. lower parishes
mean business and des.re the es
tablishment, ol the line.

was never so gmiil as at, the present
time During the past year it lias enlarg
ed its flidd ami improved its facilities in
every direction, aud enters upon the clos

ing prospects. THE TRIBUNE, however,
believes iu deeds rather than iu words—in
results rather than in promises. It, points
to its records and its columns for the past
twelve months as the best evidence of
what, it has done, and I he most satisfacto
ry pledge of what, it will do. All the dis
tinct ivo features of the paper will be pre
served and strengthened ; the "Extras"
whose sale, lias reached hundreds of thou
sands, will be continued, and the present
admitted pre-eminence of the paper not.
