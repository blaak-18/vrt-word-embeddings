The Roman emperors instituted
the imperial Natalia with a view to
strengthening the belief in their own
divinity, as all the festivals of the
ancients were commonly dedicated to
the gods.
The church substituted the names
of “saints” for those of the pagan
gods. After the bishops had usurped
considerable governmental authority,
there was instituted a festival called
“natalis episcopi”—birthday of the
bishop—celebrating the date of con
secration or installation (Catholic
Encyc., 111, 160). An eighth century
English calendar contains 88 holi
days besides Sundays (p. 163). Piux
X sanctioned 280 holidays, which
were obligatory, by virtue of a decree
of the Council of Trent (p. 165).
“Owing to difficulties created by civil
rulers,” this number has been great
ly reduced, usually by the institution
of “doubles,” i. e., two on the same
date. “The excessive number of
feast days was included in 1523
among the Centum Gravanina (100
grievances) of the German nation.
. . . Pope Urban VIII in 1642 de
prived bishops of the right to insti
tue holidays without the permission
of the Holy See, and limited the
number of general obligation to 34.
At present Rome numbers eighteen
of obligation (exclusive of Sundays,
but only nine of these are recognized
as legal holidays by the government
of Italy” (p. 165).
Americans report from the devas
tated territories of Europe that the
numerous obligatory holidays consti
tute a serious handicap to economic
readjustment.

The American states accord recog

holidays. Thanksgiving Day is pure

ernors recommend thanksgiving to
God, without distinction as to the
name by which He is to be addressed
—Jehovah, Lord, Allah, Christ—leav

worshiper. Nor is there here any
compulsion.
Fourth of July, Decoration Day,
Washington’s and Lincoln’s birthdays
are all calculated to foster senti
ments of patriotism. Labor Day
also, in that it is dedicated to the
laborers (i. e., manual laborers) of
the nation, emphasizes the fact that
in a republic the sovereignty is in the
masses, and that “the greatest good
to the greatest number” is its fun

of the heroic resolution which made
us a free nation, a tribute to the
memory of those who have died for
liberty, and a signal honor to the
two men who stood at the helm when
our nation was launched and when it
passed through the terrible crisis of
civil war, must awaken in the hearts
of the rising generation a feeling of
reverence for our institutions and an
interest in the principles involved in
those conflicts. Interest in the prin
ciples of government is absolutely
indispensable to the security of a re
public.

THAT AMERICANS SHOULD
By ALICE O. THORSON.
fore the rising generation as objects
of emulation, both for their patriot
ism and their honorable private lives.
The question now arises: What is
there in the character of Christopher
Columbus which we would wish to
see inculcated in the American na
tion? Was he pariotic? Was he
animated by a high sense of honor?
Did he signalize his career by serv
ice to humanity or in any wise con
tribute to the cause of civil or re
ligious liberty?
Data gathered from Columbus’ own
writings are so contradictory that
there is a discrepancy of sixteen
years between the earliest and latest
dates which historians have ascribed
to his birth (1435-51). (Chambers’
Encyc. says 1436, Standard Die.,
1446. Henri Vignaud, 1451. This
date is accepted by Britannica and
Catholic Efncyc.).
Columbus Was Money Mad
His most conspicuous trait of char
acter is avarice. His Journal, tran
scribed in part in Las Casas’ “His
tory of the Indies,” is. filled with ac
counts of his search for gold and in
vocations for divine aid in this effort.
(Original documents edited by
Bourne, Northmen, Columbus and the
Cabots, 196, 412, and many other
places. See also Winsor’s Columbus,
461.)
It was Columbus’ greedy demands,
and not fear of the voyage, that
caused the Portuguese king to reject
his proposition. The Spanish sov
ereigns virtually mortgaged their
crown in acceding to his demands,
which included that he and his lineal
heirs, to the end of time, were to be
governors and viceroys of any lands
which might be discovered, that they
were to have 10 per cent of all pro
ducts and 8 per cent of profits on
transportations to and from the New
World. Afterwards, he put forward
a claim to one-third of the land (as
private property) on account of a
technicality in the articles of agree
ment. (Writings of Columbus, edit
ed by Paul L. Ford, 78. The articles
are to be found in Orig. Doc., pp. 77-
84.) He declares to their highnesses
that he would not have undertaken
such a dangerous voyage except in
anticipation of this reward (Writ
ings, 179.)
Columbus a Cruel and Heartless Man
Columbus proposed the enslave
ment of the natives of San Salvador
in the entry made in his Journal
(which he addressed to Ferdinand and
Isabella) on the day of landing, Oct.
12 (Orig. Doc., 112.) Las Casas re
lates that he saw about 6,000 Indian
children die within three or four
months, by reason of their parents
being forced to abandon them to
work in the mines (Winsor, 506.)
He also relates that some of the
Spaniards bartered these wretched
babies for gold in a certain island
where cannibalism existed (Thrasher,
Columbus, I, 129). Columbus wrote
that girls, from nine years and up,
brought a hundred Castellanos
(equivalent to about $300) (Orig.
Doc., 879). He .complained that his
associates were more interested in
slave hunting than gold mining.
The population of the island was
nearly exterminated. Five shiploads
aent to Seville (Helps: Spanish Con
quest’ I, 113; Encyc. Brit., VI, 742),
June 24, 1495.
Columbus was ignorant and super-
THE CALL OF THg NORTH
PAY TRIBUTE Toi HIM ?
stitious. He never knew that the
“Indies” bordered on a new conti
nent. He declared that the earth
was pear-shaped, with the Garden of
Eden at its apex, which he located
at the source of the Orinoco (or
whatever river it was that he dis
covered) (Writings, 40). He declared
that the “Holy Trinity” had inspired
him with the knowledge that he could
reach Indian by sailing due west
(Writings, 83). Some young women,
sent by a wicked magician, having
magic power concealed in their
clothes, came aboard at the place, but
he escaped annihilation by promptly
sending them ashore (Orig. Doc., 409,
Writings, 225).
Columbus Revealed Traits of Trickery
He required his crew to subscribe
to his erroneous idea concerning the
land he had discovered, under threat
of heavy fine for officers, and com
mon sailors to have their tongues
tom out, if they recanted (Winsor,
2966). The common sailor named
Triana, who first sighted land, was
defrauded of the reward promised by
Isabella, Columbus claiming he had
seen a light the previous night. It
was paid him annually from the rev
enues of the slaughterhouse at Se
ville (Helps, 176; Winsor, 209).
He pretended to have had a celes
tial vision, and had a book of proh
ecies compiled to show that he was
a personage foretold in the Scrip
tures (Orig. Doc., 100, 404, 414, foot
note).
It is quite obvious that his recall
from the New World and his virtual
imprisonment was due to his tyran
nical rule and his diversion of royal
perquisites to his own pocket. This
may be seen from his lame explana
tion of the gold and jewels found in
his possession when superseded by
Bobadilla (Orig. Doc., 373). Boba
dilla and Fonseca, his chief oppo
nents, were ecclesiastics. Fonseca
had many bishoprics and was called
“the third king of Spain.”
There is no proof that Columbus
ever offered to undertake a voyage
on behalf of his “native land.” He
tried to sell his allegiance to Por
tugal and was finally accepted by
the Spanish sovereigns. When he
felt confident of their interest he
threatened to go to France.
Henry Vignaud pretty conclusively
shows that Columbus was possessed
of specific information concerning
certain islands in the Western ocean,
obtained from a shipwrecked pilot
who died in his house. The Pinzon
brothers, who contributed one of the
ships of his fleet, are said to have
been French seamen who had taken up
abode in Spain after desertion or mu
tiny in the French navy, and that
they, too, had seen such islands
(Parkman, Pioneers of France, 190).
The disappearance of the maps
and log of the Cabots was laid to the
Spanish ambassador (Winsor, 343).
A document from the Spanish ar
chives, recently published, justifies
suspicion (Orig. Doc., 430). Similar
grounds may be ascribed for the pau
city of written evidence as to Norse,
Portuguese, French and other voy
ages. The Bulls issued by Alexander
VI, May 3 and 4, 1493, bestowed the
New World on Spain, and the priest
hood would naturally seek to uphold
the justice of this award . (Bulla are
cited in full in a Spanish history by
Navarsete, 11, 23, 28, 130. I wish
they might be brought out in English
by the Congressional Record).
Columbus’ Moral Conduct Not Above
Reproach
Columbus had a wife and at least
one child (a eon, Diego), whom he
left in Portugal. While hanging
about the Spanish court at Cordova
he became involved in a liaison with
Beatrice Enriquez. He expresses re
morse for his conduct toward her in
his will (Thacher, I, 442; Writings,
248; Winsor, 168). He declares her
to be the mother of his son Ferdi
nand and imposes on his legitimate
son Diego the duty of providing for
her maintenance.
Canonization of Columbus was
first advocated by Count Roselly de
Lorgue a Frenchman) about the mid
dle of the nineteenth century. His
arguments ,were presented at a Va
tican Council in 1870, and Pius IX
was favorable. The petition was
signed by an imposing array of pre
lates, but the committee reported ad
versely, on account of “grave doubts
concerning the previous character of
Columbus.” (De Costa, Pre-Colum
bian Discovery of America, Munsell’s
Sons, N. Y., p. 60, footnote. This
writer was for many years pastor of
St. John’s—Episcopal—Church, New
York. Apostatized to Rome a few

WE MAKE MANY LAWS
When it comes to our lawß, we
have to face & number of unpleasant
facts and disagreeable situations.
Our courts are congested, and our
laws too numerous, conflicting and
uncertain. In many jurisdictions it
takes a year or more to get a trial
with an action at law. Calendars are
cluttered with motions and matters
of procedure which do not enter into
the rights of the parties involved.
Many thousands of cases annually
are brought to the courts for settle
ment which, under normal conditions,
would be arbitrated as to the facts,
with no question as to the law.
It is, of course, a well known fact
that American courts have had to re
sort to the precedents of old English
common law where no direct case or
statute law appeared to aply “on all
fours” in our own legal history.
This has perhaps been the underlying
reason for the inordinate quantity of
common and statute law promulgat
ed during the last few decades. Na
tional pride and the desire amply to
cover all possible situations with our
own statutes and precedents is nat
ural. It must not be forgotten,
either, that we have been consolidat
ing a transcontinental empire, and
that a democratic system produces
an excess rather than a dearth of
laws.
It has been estimated that, in a
single year (1919), in only 35 of our
48 states, nearly 40,000 bills were in
troduced and more than 13,000 were
passed at a cost of about S9OO per
law. Congress handles anywhere
from 10,000 to 20,000 bills in a sin
gle session, and it is estimated that
the last congress passed 930 laws.
There is no exact record of the num
ber of laws now on the statute books
throughout the country, but certainly
there are at least 50,000 and probably
more nearly 100,000. —Review of Re

WHY PUBLIC SCHOOLSP
-K-K
SOME FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR OUR
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
k-k-k
By HENRY G. TARDY.
Much is said and written about the
necessity of maintaining the public
schools, hut too little is said of the
reasons why they should be maintain
ed. The parent who has children at
tending the schools is naturally in
terested in them, but that interest is
often based only on the selfish one
of having his own children educated
at the public expense. That selfish
interest, however, is not incompatible
with the interests of the public. In
fact, that selfish interest is beneficial
to the public interest in maintaining
the schools at the highest standard of
excellence and makes the parent a
student of the public school system.
Public School Safeguards Nation
The larger public interest in the
maintenance of the public school sys
tem is not, however, the private inter
est of the parent or of the child, but
the creation of good and capable fu
ture citizens of the Republic. If it
were not for that purpose, it would
be immaterial to the state how its
children were educated. In a republic
like that of ours education is the
corner-stone of the whole govern
mental structure. It is the source of
strength against assaults upon the
Government from enemies within or
without its boundaries. But for the
purposes of a republic the education
of its citizens must contain certain
fundamental characteristics. One of
these fundamentals is an understand
ing by one man of his fellow-man.
That uderstandiqg is not the result
of an elaborate educational system
but merely the result of contact with
others under circumstances making
that contact form a lasting impres
sion upon the inner nature. Such a
point of contact enables a man,
whether rich or poor, to uderstand the
hopes, aspirations and life of his fel
low-man. That understanding is ne
cessary in a government where every
man is either a direct or indirect law
maker. Some men acquire that un
derstanding through their business
relations, while others acquire it at
school or by membership in some or
ganization where all face a common
danger such as in an army in ac
tion. But, unfortunately, many peo
ple never acquire it. There is one
universal place, however, where all
citizens should meet each other on a
common level and on terms of equali
ty, and that is in their early youth
in the common public schools. In
the elementary common schools the
child meets or should meet all his fu
ture fellow-citizens. It will have a
broadening effect not only upon those
who will be forced to leave school
early in life but also on those who
are able to obtain a university edu
cation. It will fit all who thus meet
as children of the Republic to live
on terms of real democracy and with
a realization that each is essential in
the complete scheme of life. Much
of the misunderstanding and social
unrest of the present time is the re
sult of the failure on the part of
people in different walks of life to
really understand one another.
Democratic Institution Will Develop
Child Properly
Besides, a truly democratic educa
tion will develop character, and
character will give rise to ideals
based on it instead of upon wealth
and evanescent show. No man of
wealth should allow his children to
attend a private school during the
early and formative period of child
hood. His children, without the bene
fit of a common public education,
will have missed something which
they may never acquire later and
which is essential to their success if
they are to become leaders in the
community in political professional or
commercial life.
The public schools are the Common
sources of knowledge of the nature
of our government and of its aims
and purposes. It is there that all
children should learn the great beau

ties of our form of government aad
the fact that, under our governmental
system, we can have as good or as
bad an administration of government
as the citizens desire or approve.
If the common public schools in any
locality are not good enough for the
children of its best citizens, then such
best citizens should join with their
fellow-citizens and raise the standard
of the school to that of the best. It
is for the citizens of each locality to
see that their schools are maintain
ed at the highest standards. Public
education is a function of govern
ment which should be maintained free
from partisan politics, and citizens
of education and character should
take an active part in seeing that the
schools are managed by educational
leaders who have the interests of
education at heart. Those who de
vote their lives to the education of
our children should be honored by the
community on account of their pro
fession and also properly compensat
ed as are other important agents of
government. The proper way to raise
the dignity and importance of educa
tion in the public eye is to officially
recognize that it is a function of both
our state and Federal Government
and this can best be done by creating
a Department of Education under the
charge of a Cabinet officer, as is pro
posed by the Sterling-Towner Bill
now dead in committee. Such a rec
ognition of education as one of the
functions and duties of government
will make people recogize the real
purpose of education, and will enable
those localities which can ill afford
the best educational facilities a
means to obtain them through Fed
eral aid. Besides, the department
will act as a great clearing house in
respect to educational matters for all
the states and enable educators to
keep in touch with the best education
al methods, for, although the funda
mentals of education do not change,
methods of imparting such funda
mentals are being constantly im
proved.
General education in the fundamen
tals will enable our citizens to under
stand the true meaning of liberty in
a republic, to think clearly and un
derstandingly on public questions, to
intelligently correct the imperfec
tions of government, and to attain
a realization of those ideals in gov
ernment held by the thinking states
men of our age.
KLANSMEN CELEBRATE
Klansmen of Charleston, South
Carolina, are celebrating the election
of Protestant Americans to the var
ious municipal offices in their city and
the elimination of Catholic control of
their local politics.
In one of the bitterest fought elec
tions in recent years and amid con
ditions which made it necessary for
Governor McLeod to call out the na
tional guard to ensure a fair vote and
prevent rioting, Thomas P. Stoney,
who the newspapers alleged to be a
Klansman, defeated Mayor John P.
Grace, a Roman Catholic and a
Knight of Columbus, by a majority of
1,265 votes. The entire Stoney ticket
was swept into office by similar ma
jorities.
Mayor Stoney was elected on a
pledge to give his city good govern
ment and end the ring control of mu
nicipal politics.
Seattle Klan Number 4, Realm of
Washington, is working for Ameri
can principles through the medium of
circulars since the newspapers of
their city will not grant them any
space for news or advertisement. A
recent circular called attention to an
unpatriotic editorial in the Seattle
Times and told the public that the
Klan opposed such editorial opinions.
