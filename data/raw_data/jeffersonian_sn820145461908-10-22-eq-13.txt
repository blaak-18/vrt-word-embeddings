TO OUR MANY FRIENDS—
GREETING.
You are going to visit Atlanta
soon, are you not? Coming to the
fair, or on business, or to do some
shopping, any one of a dozen reasons
will probably bring you to the Cap
ital. ,
We cordially invite each one of you
to visit our headquarters, at 709 Tem
ple Court, corner of Alabama and
Pryor streets —just one block from the
old depot, you will find congenial
spirits. You will hear the latest news
of the campaign. You can help the
workers here with suggestions; you
can carry home with you tickets and
literature that will promote the cause.
Don’t miss the chance of getting in
touch with the work in a vital and up
lifting way. Mr. Watson will drop in
whenever he can, and his lieutenants
will be on hand at all hours.
Say, with us, 1 ‘Georgia for Wat
son ! ’ ’
Yours to that end,
J. J. HOLLOWAY,
Chairman.
J. E. BODENHAMER,
Secretary.

We thank the many true Jefferson
ians who have helped us by sending
in new subscribers. Let every reader
of this paper, if he really believes in
Jeffersonian principles, clip the lit
tle coupon on the back page and
send us at least one new name. Last
week we had forty-four new subscrib
ers, in answer to our request. This
week we have ninety-five more. Can’t
you boys get out and hustle next
week, and send us over a hundred?
Have you noticed our clubbing of
fers this fall? By taking advantage
of them you will get two papers for
little more than the price of one. To
those who want a daily paper we offer
The Atlanta Georgian and the
Jeffersonian for 64.15 Some peo
ple prefer their paper three times a
week, and they can get the tri-week
ly Constitution and the Jeffersonian
for $1.50. To our Texas friends we
offer the National Co-Operator and
the Jeffersonian for $1.35, and the
Farmers’ Union folks can get the
Union News and the Jeffersonian for
$1.25. Last and best, comes the
staunch old Missouri World, which
we will send you, with the Jeffer
sonian, for sl.lO.
If you want to get the Jeffersonian
free, send us two dollars and the
names of two new subscribers (not
renewals), and we will enter your
own name on our mailing list for a
year. If you want to get the Jeffer
sonian Magazine for nothing, send us
three dollars and the names of three
new subscribers (not renewals), and
you will receive it for one year free.
Another clubbing arrangement
which is very popular is the combina
tion of the Pictorial Review, Modern
Priscilla, Ladies’ World, our Maga
zine and Weekly, and a Pictorial Re
view dress pattern, the total value of
which is $6.25. We offer the bunch
for $2.50. This offer was at first
limited to October 1, but we have
succeeded in getting it extended to
November 15. Now, if you women
folks will get five new subscribers to
either the Magazine or the Weekly
Jeffersonian, we will send you the
above combination free. Send us
five dollars for five new names, and
you will receive all these papers and
magazines for one year.
By some strange trick of type
writer, or type, last week the “Gal
ley” said: “We had to enlarge our
paper to four columns to take care
of the advertisements, and now we
have reduced our rates. ’ ’ The fact is
that our advertising rates have been
going up as steadily as the cost of
living. At the beginning of this year
we were carrying an average of about
400 lines of advertising per week.
The Jeffersonian last week contained
1,260 lines of paid advertising, and
□kffersonlan,
this notwithstanding an increase in
rates amounting to fifty per cent.
More than that. On November 15
we shall again increase our rates, ird
we expect to hold every line of ad
vertising that we carry now, and a
few lines more. The whole secret is
that the Jeffersonian gets results
Take the case of a man who ha J
some second-hand machinery to sell
last month. He had been advertising
in other papers for about six weeks,
without success, before he happened
to think of the Jeffersonian. He gave
us an order to run his ad for a
month. The first week came a fran
tic letter from him: “Please st-p
my ad. I’ve sold my machinery, and
I’ll have to spend the money in hir
ing a stenographer if you run my
ad any longer.”
A word to our agents. This is the
time of year when subscriptions come
rolling in fast, and if an agent will
get out and hustle he can make good
money. We are offering many valua
ble premiums for the household. If
a man wants to work for cash, we
give him a liberal commission, which
will pay him well for his labor. If
he works for the honor and glory
of the cause, giving his commissions
away, he will have his reward.
One of our agents sent us 96 sub
scriptions last month; another sent
in 43, and many have forwarded 15
or 20 in the last thirty days. All this
work has been done at odd times;
and the money, amounting to ten or
twelve dollars a month for each
agent, was clear gain. Some of our
lady agents have picked up quite a
nice little sum of pin money in this
way.
We are always willing to help by
sending out sample copies to pros
pective subscribers, and that is. by
far the most effective way for an
agent to follow. Pick out those of
your neighbors who are interested in
politics, and let us send them one or
two copies of our paper and maga
zine. Most of the recipients will
read the Jeffersonians out of curios
ity, if for no better reason. And our
paper has a peculiar quality—the
same that is fatal to flies. What is
put there sticks. A man may
“Pshaw!” and “Rot!” and say
even stronger things, but he can’t
get off the printed page. His ex
clamations grow milder, and at last
he takes the blamed paper, just to see
what it has to say each week. Cu
riosity killed the cat.
We have now made arrangements
for the sale of our Magazine in Paris,
France, where Brentano, 37 Avenue
de I’Opera, will handle it, and will
also take subscriptions for both Jef
fersonians. This was brought about
by a letter from Donald Harper, the
American lawyer in Paris,
