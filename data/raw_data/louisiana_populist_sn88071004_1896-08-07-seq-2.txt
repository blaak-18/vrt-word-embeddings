1 Patrioeism Tested.
Many times have the Populists
r been denounced by the old parties
- as demagogues, office seekers and
insincere upon the principles they
r. advocate.
r. Following up these slanders the
Democrats of the South have ap- 1
plied political, social and financial 1
is oppression to force back if possi
ble those who dared leave their
party in obedienco to principle and
- conscience.
Though used in all ages by par- I
Stitian fools to strengthen their own
- organizations, persecution has nev- i
ler yet failed to help the cause i
~ against which it was directed and 1
to destroy its own originators.
So the People's party has flour
! ished in the South by reason of its i
oppressions. Witness the Hon.
"Amazon Murphy, of Atlanta, Ga.,
" who says "1 was made a Populist
. when I, as a Democrat, was fore
u ed to protect Tom Watson from 1
being rotten-egged in the city of I
Atlanta." "It was the intolerance
of the Democratic party that forc- i
ed me mto the People's party."
4But this is not the worst feature
e of the situation. Overcoming all
r this oppression, intolerance and 4
mountain obstacles by unexampled
patience, self-denials and heroism i
of brave men sad true women, the
People's party have won battle af- 1
B ter battle,. election after election,
p only to have the fruits of their
, hard-earned victory sroumn under
cover of darkness, fraud and high- 1
' way robbery, as black as bell itself.
As much as one may urge that I
the Democratic party has reformed 1
itself and cast of its corrupt lead
ers in nominating the young hero
I of the Wet, it can be shown that
the'Ien who ran the machine at
Chicago and placed the Westerner
in nomination, are the same men
who have steeped the party in its .
blackest frands in the South for
the past 90 years.
imrine then the patriotism, the
deep devotion to the cause of free
silver whieh must have actuated the
Popliats of the South at the St.
Louis eoemvetiom, when more than
5-third at them voted for the Dem
oeratic sominee for ?resident, Wm.
J. Bryan.
Nor sea it be attribted to the
Ssupposed desire of new Populists
Sto return to the Democratic fold,
i &or the delate from New York
i' wo_ jsl e CoL S. F. Norton in
a lomlmd was perhaps the youg

Against the Drouth.
"Hard times" is the cry now
and the Fall and Winter is looked
forward to with dread by many in
the drouth stricken region of North
Louisiana. Crops are reduced
over 50 per cent in every part of
this section, and in the worst dis
tricts the crops are a total failure,
and stock are dying for the want
of grass and water.
There is nothing that can com
pletely repair this serious damage,
but absolute want and suffering
can be avoided by following the
rains, which must and will come
in a few days, with the many Au
tumn crops which can be grown
to perfection in this climate.
Irish potatoes, turnips, radishes,
onions and other esculents, will
mature to perfection planted any
time in August, or even to 15th of
September, and will do much to
ward feeding hungry, people, or
piecing out supplies that may be
bought or saved from the drouth.
Then oats, rye and peas, will
make excellent pasture and forage
for stock, while the two first named
will ripen a crop of grain so early
in the Spring that the short crop
of corn will hardly be miseel.
So the energetic farmer-the
most independent and self-reliant
person on earth-will not despair,
but will tighten up his belt, take
another hitch in his "gallus" and
go patiently on with his task of
feeding himself and the nations of
the earth, and if he continues edu
cating himself on political econo
my-will m a few.more years, aULE
the nations of earth as well as feed
them.
Then a drouth will not be such
a serious matter as now.
Correction.
We notice in the Peoples Party
Paper and some others, the vote of
the St. Louis Populist convention
on the minority report of the com
mittee on rules and order of busi
I ness, which was the selection of the
Vice-Presidential candidate first,
and the winning move of the "mid
dle-of-the-roaders." In this vote
Louisiana is recorded S yeas and
26 nays, which is not correct. Lou
isiana had 32 votes in the conven
tion, and on this question cast 28
for the minority and 4 for the ma
jority report.
On the vote for Vice-President
Louisiana gave Watson 80, anad Se
wall 2, and'about the same propor
tion in favor of all other "MiddIe
of-the-Road" actions.
But for to sake ofthe great
SPople's party of the West, and to
ashbow our sincerity for free coinage
of silver and to seesum it at this
eleation, we save Bryan S0 votes
for Preaident, to mot avot g.
We took this positio in the face
Sof the abuse, ridicle a d swind

ot the Democrats of thi 8tate, in

A Dramatic Episode.
( (MIonroo Bulletin.)
I Th repeatedl outbr4eak' of en.
n thusiasism at St. Louis showed how
earnest the delegates were. Of all
I the scenes in that convention none
f were more thrilling than that which
- followed Judge Gunby's nomination
of Tom Watson on Friday night:
t Ex-Congressman Pence of New
York had made a strong appeal for
- the nomination of Sewall and had
challenged any delegate to answer
r his arguments. The friends of
e Watson felt depressed and yearned
e for some one to answer Pence.
- When Louisiana was called Judge
i Gunby stood in his chair and spoke
for five minutes with such effect
that the whole audience, including
I delegates and galleries, rose to their
V feet and engaged in a perfect ova
f tion of applause which lasted for
- several minutes during which Judge
r Gunby was carried around the hall
e on the shoulders of the enthusias
tic Georgians. From that time on
I Watson swept the field and was
c declared the unanimous nominee of
I that great convention. The follow
y ing is a brief sketch of Judge Gun
by's speech :
"A r. Chairman-Louisiana joins
e the throng of states that are rally
t ing under the banner of gallant
Tom Watson. Sir, no impartial
e observer of this convention can
deny that the People's party has
f within its own ranks plenty of ma
f terial to fill the highest offices with
honor. It has broad statesmen,
deep thinkers, noble patriots, and
imperial orators among whom I
3 will mention but one, the brave,
the true, the uncompromising Tom
Watson, the plumed knight of pop
ulism who never deserted a friend
or compromised a principle, the
foremost living patriot.
Nobody ever accused him of try
f ing to put the new' wine of popu
a lism into old democratic bottles.
"Mr. Chairman, I do not wish
- to attack any other man placed in
e nomination here, but the defiant
tone of the gentleman fron New
York demands reply. I do not
e understand why this convention
I should nominate a president of a
Snational bank in order to put down
Sbanks. I do not understand, and
g the genetleman from New York
has not enlightened me, why we
shodid nominate a railroad mag
i nate to check the oppressions and
monopolies of railroads. Nor can
I conceive how sensible men could
select the greatest corporationist
of New England in order to des
troy the encroachments of organi
sed corporate greed. I nominate
a m a who can stand on the plat
e form we have adopted with both
feet. I nominate a man who will
never withdraw, never waver, nev
Ser pse in the battle for the peo
- pe's cse.
"Mr. Chairman, this is tLhe irst
convention sance the war in which
Sthe Southa mn hope to bheard. The
