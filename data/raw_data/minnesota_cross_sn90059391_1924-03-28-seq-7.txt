governor overlooks. He overlooks al
so the thousands of fires successful
ly fought and extinguished. The rec
ords show that we have been getting
a greater measure of active and ef
fective co-operation from settlers,
railroads and lumber companies than
has any other state.
“If Governor Preus was as deeply
concerned in forest fire prevention
as he would have us believe, I won
der why it was that he withheld the
board of relief money which we had
asked for and the legislature pro
vided for emergency purposes?
Timber Estimates Jokes
“Statements made by the governor
and by Mr. Gearheart and Mr. Doug
las with reference to state timber
should not go unchallenged. It is
well known that the handling of
state timber and particularly the
sales policy has been such that for a
number of years as a member of the
timber board, I have refused to sign
the estimate sheets or sale permits.
Mr. Preus has refused to give me the
opportunity to have forest officers
check up in the field to see if the
timber was of such character as to
warrant sale. The timber estimates
in the auditor’s office are little more
than a joke, frequently showing less
than 20 per cent, sometimes 10 per
cent of the timber of different kinds
actually on the land. The deposits
made by the companies on their bids
are based on these estimates.
“When such poor judgment was
shown as to the quantity of timber
on the tracts estimated, I have nat
urally questioned the judgment of
those responsible for determining the
quantity and the character of the
timber. Consequently from time to
time I have objected to the sale of
numerous tracts aggregating many
thousands of acres of timber, per
haps half of which was reluctantly
held from sale. Later investigations
have shown that large quantities,
probably more than half of what was
actually sold, was thrifty, growing
timber and should have been reserved
by the state for further growth.
Clouding the Issue
“It is understood that Mr. Diercks
of the auditor’s office, whom the gov
ernor recently made a member of
the forestry board, was interested in
getting through the legislature the
measure which permits three mem
bers of the timber board to transact
business and thus ignore the forest
er in timber matters.
“It would appear that all these ex
planations by the governor and all
the unfair criticism he and his
friends are leveling at me must be
for the unfair purpose of clouding
the real issues, which are: Shall we
or shall we not let partisan policies
run forestry? And as to the person
nel of the forestry board, shall we
permit any man associated with Wis
consin pulp wood interests to be in
a position to influence Minnesota’s
Klicy in the management of its tim
r lands?”
Following, in part, is an editorial
which appears in the current issue of
American Forests and Forest Life pub
lished by the American Forestry as
sociation, of which Henry S. Graves
of Yale University is president, and
which includes among its members
the most noted conservationists and
some of the most prominent business
men of the United States.
Blot on State
“The methods by which Mr. Cox
was ousted are a blot upon the state
of Minnesota; they are a travesty
upon the name of representative
government. Mr. Cox, as guardian
of the state’s natural resources, re
fused to play politics. The politi
cians, therefore, set out to override
public sentiment and to get rid of
him. It was a long fight, but the pol
iticians won.
“By the dismissal of Mr. Cox, Min
nesota has lost an able and upright
forester—a man who has had the
courage to oppose large interests
special privileges from the state's
natural resources. He refused to
mix conservation and politics. The
state is indebted to him for a forest
department that ranks high among
the state.
“If in his place the Preus board of
forestry appoints a politician. Min
nesota will indeed have been thrown
back into the dark ages of conser-

that the unfair, high-handed treat

Since his dismissal by the packed
forestry board on orders from Gov
ernor Preus, Cox has received many
letters from the foremost conserva
tionists of the country, praising his
work in Minnesota and condemning
the action of the Preus board. Some
of these follow:
Letter From Federal Man
From A. B. Greeley, chief forester,
United States forest service, Wash
ington.
My Dear Cox: I was much surprised
and shocked at the news which we re
ceived at the end of last week regard
ing the action of the state board of
forestry in relieving you of the du
ties of state forester. I had sup
posed that the acute phases of this
controversy had been passed, for the
time being, at least, and that your
continued work in Minnesota was as
sured.
The fundamental issue in this con
troversy, as I have understood it, is
not a personal one, but the policy
which the state is to follow in re
gard to the disposition and adminis
tration of its own forest lands. I
have felt that you were absolutely
right in the policies which you have
endeavored to have the state adopt
and follow in the preservation and
conservative use of its own forest re
sources; and it certainly will be a
severe setback to forest conservation
in the United States if the forester’s
office leads to a reversal or impair
ment of the program which you nave
sought to bring about in the admin
istration of the forest lands of the
state.
I would be glad to learn what you
may have in mind as to .your future
course and plans, and also how you
think the change will affect the for
est policies of the state. If vou
have any tentative plans or ideas in
view in which I could he of any as
sistance to you. I will be glad to have
you write me freely and fully regard
ing them.
You have put up a splendid fight,
Coxey, and I believe the great ma
jority of the people of the state are
with you. I hope that the action of
the state board does not mark the
end of this fight.
Whenever you have the time, write
me all about it, and let me know par
ticularly if there are any ways in
which I can be of help to you per
sonally.”

IN VALLEY OF KINGS AT LUXOR, EGYPT
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 24. -
New light on the sources of the Bi
ble is eagerly sought by critics and
commentators the world over. The
startling discoveries in the Valley of
the Kings have so occupied public
attention that some less vivid, but
perhaps more important, have escap
ed general notice. From Glasgow,
Scotland, comes the account .of the
discovery of a Biblical manuscript in
Egypt which may be of the greatest
importance. According to this ac
count about 100 miles north of Tut
ankh-Amen’B tomb in the Valley
of the Kings at Luxor lies the
once important village of Quau-el-
Kebir on the right side of the Nile.
Here last winter members of the
British school of archaeology were
excavating among the rubbish heaps,
and one day a broken earthenware
jar was dug up. One of them saw a
Mind-t olored rag in the jar, which
proved to he a bag, and in the bag
were inscribed papyrus leaves. Fur
ther examination showed that the
THE FIERY CROSS
in which it was accomplished. As a
body of professional foresters the sec
tion believes it essential that state
departments of forestry be organized
on a stable basis, uninfluenced by par
tisan politics, under the leadership
of a competent forester, and with ade
quate financial support. We regard
the action of the state board of for
estry in dis-.issing an official of long
service and high standing in his pro
fession without even a hearing aa not
only unfair to you, but as constitut
ing a grave threat to the sound de
velopment of state forest policy gen
erally.
From F. W. Besley, state forester,
Baltimore, Maryland.
Dear Cox: It is with profound re
gret that I heard of your dismissal
as state forester of Minnesota.
You told me a couple of years ago
some of the difficulties that you were
having with certaih predatory inter
ests in the state, and while I have
not the particulars, it is very grati
fying to know that you did not sur
render. but went down fighting for
the principles that you believed to
be right. I feel and I am sure the
whole profession feels that Minneso
ta has taken a backward step that she
will soon regret, or rather, certain
ones in a position of authority have
taken a step, in which I feel sure
that the people of the state will not
acquiesce.
As state forester, I want to file this
protest against the high-handed pro
cedure, and express the hope that
there may be an opportunity to pre
sent the case fairly and fully before
the people of the state, so that you
may be entirely vindicated and sup
ported.
If there is anything that I can do
to help the cause of righteousness,
please do not hesitate to call upon
me.
('anudlan for Cox
From F. T. Stevenson, district for
est inspector, Winnipeg, Manitoba.
My Dear Cox: I have just learned
with much regret of your leaving the
Minnesota state forestry service and
I certainly deplore the shartsighted
ness of the state forestry board in
taking the action they did. While
the whole incident is probably an un
happy one for you, it will certainly
bring before the public forestry mat
ters in Minnesota in a manner no
other action might have accomplished,
and the loss to the state of Minne
sota in any event will be much great
er than your personal loss, as the
stand you have taken will only in
crease your already high standing and
prestige in forestry matters in Amer
ica.
1 hope that now you are temporar
ily free that you will take what you
need —a well earned rest—and that I
may have the pleasure of seeing you
up here in the spring, when we will
certainly arrange some interesting
trips for you. No doubt your serv
ices will be in immediate demand
for some more important position
than that of state forester of Min
nesota, but in any event do not ac
cept any position until you have had
a few weeks up here with me.
While the present controversy in
Minnesota will no doubt die away, as
all such things do, the work that you
have done, the policies that you have
established and the interest that you
have created among the people will
live for all time, and you can cer
tainly feel that you are quitting work
which has been well done.
To the Forestry Board
Following is a letter from J. S.
Holmes, state forester. North Caro
lina Geological and Economic Sur
vey, to the chairman of the Minne
sota forestry board.
Dear Sir: I was very much sur
prised and distressed recently to hear
of the summary action taken by your
board against my friend and co
worker, Mr. W. T. Cox, your state
forester. I have known Mr. Cox for
many years, having been connected
with him in the U. S. forest service
before either of us went into state
work. I consider Mr. Cox one of the
leading men in his profession and
one of the most effective and out
standing state foresters in the coun
try.
I have, of course, no means of
knowing definitely what actuated
your board in discharging Mr. Cox,
hut if it was for political expediency
or personal spite, I claim tne right
as a friend of Mr. Cox, as a member
of the the executive committee of
the Association of State Foresters,
and as president of the southern for
estry congress, of protesting most
strongly against such action. For
estry work must be removed from po
litical influence in order to be ef
fective, as no self-respecting man af
ter years of study and further years
of actual experience can subject him
sel to political dictation. Wherever
politics has entered into the for
estry work it has been to the detri
ment of the state and the efficiency
of the work . It is only by keeping
it on the high ground of efficiency
and uprightness that it can accom
plish what it proposes. I hope that
you can bring this matter to the at
tention of your advsiory board.
writing was in Coptic characters and
scriptural. They were sent to Eng
land to Sir Flinders Petrie, the di
rector of the school of Archaeology
in Egypt. Soon seeing the word
“Lazarus” and other Biblical words,
he knew that the manuscript was one
of the gospels and not merely an old
Coptic sermon. It turned out to be
the Gospel of John.
Each page is about 9V6 inches by
4Va inches. Sheets are missing from
the beginning and end, and pages
11-12 and 33-34, but Btt pages contain
the continuous text of the Egyptian
version. Experts conclude that the
manuscript was probably written
about the beginning of the fifth cen
tury which would make it the oldest
known copy of any Coptic Christ inn
book. The text has not yet been all
translated; so it is not yet known
which Egyptian version this repre
sents. Before the end of the year,
the British school of Archaeology
hope to publish, n translation of the
text, illustrated with photographs of
the actual words and forms used.
Oregon Has New System

A system of figuring scholastic
standing that is as fair to the stu
dent carrying a heavy course as to

worked out at the University of Ore

and will be Dut into effect next

tudents have seen the possibility of
receiving a low grade in a subject
they have dropped the course, thus

Under the new system, subjects drop

consiheration of the final result,
thus a student receiving 12 hours of
1 will be awarded 60 points while an
other receiving 12 hours of 1 and
four hours of a grade even so low as
5 will receive 64. which is rated as
the higher statding. The incentive
to pass every course and pass it with
nigh grades will still remain it is
pointed out by university officials.
Students will then stay in subjects
untii the end of the term, for they
will not better their average by drop
ping any hours. Thus the plan will
actually rate the student by what
he accomplishes.
The new system is particularly
aimed at those who quit courses be
fore the end o fthe term. This prac
tice is admittedly an evil in institu
tions of higher learning and it is ex
pected that many colleges and uni
versities will adopt a policy similar
to the one to be introduced here. In
proposing and putting into practice
the new plan the university admin
istration officials stressed the fact
that in athletics the “quitter” is
scorned while in the class rooms
standings are made higher by such
an act. The movement is hailed here
as one of the most progressive ad
vanced in years and those advocat
ing it believe it will become wide
spread in practice.

EDUCATOR PLEAS TO MAKE IMMIGRANTS
AMERICANS OR EXCLUDE THEM PROM U.S.
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 24.
—That the melting pot does not al
ways melt and that this country has
an unduly large number of unassimi
lated and unassimilable foreigners,
is contended by many friends of the
proposed new immigration law which
will materially cut the number of
nationals of other countries now be
ing welcomed to these shores under
the present law.
Miss Olive M. Jones, president of
the National Education association,
believes that while the teaching of
English to incoming foreigners is
important, it is stressed too much to
the exclusion of the reason for that
teaching. She says:
“People coming to the United
States today are not dangerous to us
because they cannot speak English,
but because they are coming from
lands which have no conception of
our American point of view. Our
Americanization work should be aim
ed at converting and evangelizing the
TRIAL OF AMERICANS
IS CALLED TRAVESTY
Four Men Held for Alleged
Established Per
fect Alibis
PITTSBURGH, PA., March 24.
Keen indignation is expressed at the
treatment accorded four reputable
American citizens of western Penn
sylvania, as the result of a farcial
hearing in the office of Squire Fred
Stuhimiller, Wednesday of this week,
when the quartet was arraigned on
charges of assault and battery and
rioting, growing out of the alleged
kidnapping of an aged foreigner at
Dravosburg several weeks ago, during
which the newspapers said "armed
and hooded men dragged the man
from his bed and to the street.”
Perfect alibis were established by
the four defendants as to their pres
ence elsewhere at the identical time
the alleged violation was perpetrated
and the aged foreigner, a cripple,
and said to be gaining his livelihood
by bootlegging, testified that he did
not know who the men were that had
kidnapped him and did not say that
the men arraigned were the guilty
ones. No one else saw the men ex
cept the officers at the police sta
tion, and they did not testify that
the men arraigned were those who
had taken the foreigner from his
home to the police station.
At one point in the proceedings,
Squire Stuhimiller virtually closed
the case by going to his cabinet and
securing blanks necessary to hold
the men for court, telling their at
torney that “he had made up his
mind already” and considered it un
necessary to listen further. One of
the warrants, it has been reported,
had been made out for Claude Hen
dershot, but when it was shown he
had an alibi, and it was reported his
name was scratched off the official
warrant, and that of his brother
George substituted.
Spectators at the hearing indicat
ed that little irregularities such as
this received very littlee attention
from the court.
All were held for court trial, but
it is firmly believed that when the
cases reach the Allegheny county
grand jury their absurdity will have
reached such a stage that the jury
men will spend little, if any, time on
them.
