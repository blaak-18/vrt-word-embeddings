BOMBAFRDMENT KEPT UP.
TIwrlve De vi and Fifteen I:adly Wnonded
'enxlezue!ul, Soldiers,
Marcaibo. Jan. 23:.-The borba.i-d
muent ,of Fort San Carlos by the Get
man cruisers Vineta, Panther and
Falke was codtinued Wednesday aft
ernoon until 6 o'clock. It was resumed
Thursday morning at daybreak. The
first shells were hurled at the Tort
at 4 o'clock at. long range. At 6
o'clock the Panther, being of light
draught, closed in and again became
actively engaged. The fort replied.
At 8 o'clock the engagement was pro
ceeding as fercely at Wednesday.
Twelve dead and fifteen badly wound
ed Venezuelan soldiers were counted
in the fort at 7 o'clock Wednesday
night by the correspondent of the As
sociated Press.
The Panther left her position close
into Fort San Carlos. which she took
up early in the day, Wednesday after
noon at 3 o'clock, and joined the Falke.
This was half a mile outside the bar
and about five miles from the fort.
At 3 o'clock the correspondent of
the Associated Press, in a rowboat, ap.
proached one side of the fort, out of
range and from this point witnessed
the long range firing of the German
cruisers, which was continued from 3
untit 6 o'clock. The Vineta and the
Falke were close together and nearer
the fort than the Panther.
The first two vessels, at a range of
four and a half miles, poured in a
continuous rain of shell upon the fort
and only stopped firing with the ad
vent of dusk at 6 o'clock. At this
hour the German vessels retired sea
ward after having made a second inef
fectual attempt to land troops in the
village of San Carlos, situated at the
base of the fort.
At 7 o'clock Wednesday afternoon
the correspondent of the Associated
Press. who was accompanied by a gov
ernment telegrapher, bearing a tele
gram from President Castro to the
mandant of San Carlos, landed on the
island and entered the fort. The walls
of the fort were terribly battered and
there were many evidences of the
fierce engagement. Twelve dead Vene
suelan soldiers were counted behind
the ramiparts and fifteen other men,
serionasiy wounded, were .lying on a
low platform. The fort Is literally
_11red with pieces of broken shells.

Washin-gt:n, JanL iL-Scenator Per
kins of California, who was recently
re-elected to another term in the upper
branch of congress, used to be fond of
playing the role of I;aroun-al-IlasliPh!d,
and many are the stories told of his
experiences in the mining camps of the
Pacific coast, where he ."grub staked"
more than one struggling fellow less
fortunate and successful than himself.
He knew how it was himself to strug
gle with adverse fate. When he land
ed on the Pacific coast. forty or fifty
years ago, a poor sailor boy, he had lit
tle except what nature had endowed
him with--strong, willing hands, a
clear and active brain and a determina
tion to win success and fortune. With
these he surmounted every obstacle
and is now not only a rich man, but a
useful and hon
ored citizen, so
he looks with
kindly sympa
thy, which fre
quently takes
more substan
tial form than
mere sentiment.

Senator Pe r
"Do I KNow rExKgIS?" kins went for
ward into the sleeping car, mingling
with the red shirted miners and swap
ping yarns and tobacco with them. One
big fellow became quite enthusiastic in
praise of "that fellow Perkins" who
had just been appointed to the United
States senate. He praised him inordi
nately, and the new senator's curiosity
was aroused to know the reason for the
miner's enthusiasm. The latter 'ex
plained that Perkins had once kept a
small store and used to grub stake him
with bacon and coffee.
"Do I know' Perkins?" continued the
mit>P exuberantly. "Well, I should
say:! I would know Perkins in hadesi"

The constitutional objeetion wich
some men have to the wearing of
"evening clothes" was
illustrated here recent
ly. A western congress
c man had a constituent
Si visiting . him at his
as uem" bome. This constituent
is a very worthy man
and an tia81etitl eitisem in his eom
amnaty, but is quite disregardful of the
eoenmmtionalities of soelety. The con
gremsna wanted to take him to the
pneeiat" s resent reeption to the dip
lematle eerpe, which, as everybody
kmows. is e a of the "emsrtbet" tune
rans of the capital. The visitor asked
what bo ought to wear, and the ehost
aplisi that an eveningta lt was the
pIamr ralment for such an ocesaess.
"What," said- the visitor, "one oa
them swawowtslied hbarness?" The host
loewed that that was about the-sle of
It.
"Wel, I Mst won't do it." said the
vitor free the woet. "Nobody will

who are now on his trail.
Senator Nelson an(d Representative
Eddy of Minnesota were the recipients
of a fine haunch of
venison the other day
Nelson and from friends at homre.
the Although it is against
Contraband the lawv to take veniso
Venison out of the state at this
------ season of the year. the
Minnesota statesmen had it cooked in
the senate restaurant and invited their
friends to a good old western venison
dinner. Then all went down into Sena
tor Nelson's committee room and sat
before an open wood fire smoking pipes
and telling stories of early Minnesota
days.
The next day the ungrateful col
leagues of the two statesmen started
the story that they had violated the
game laws. They threatened to send it
broadcast through the state to mnake all
kinds of trouble for their hosts.
*"I plead sanctuary," said Senator
Nelson. "The venison was cooked on
government reservation. Moreover, if
you tell on us I will call you ungrate
ful and quote the paragraph from the
Bible about the serpent's tooth, and
that will fix you, all right."
General Shattuc and "Doe" Norton,
representatives respectively from the
First and Thirteenth
districts of Ohio, are
Alphonse both short, stout and
and very fastidious in dress.
Gaston though with this differ
- - ence-Shattuc is partial
to gorgeous waistcoats. while Norton
affects the statesmanlike frock coat.
The other day they met in the main
aisle of the house in front of the speak
er's desk and saluted each other with a
deep bow.
"Ah, my dear Alphonse," said Dr.
Norton, "I observe that you have no
posy today. Permit me," wherewith
he took from his own lappel a blushing
carnation and with another sweeping
bow presented it.
"Ah, my dear Gaston." said the gen
eral, "I thank you," bowing as low as
his rotund figure would permit and pin
ning the flowe; to the lapel of his own
coat.
Then, arm in arm, they stalked out of
the door nearest the house restaurant
amid the general clapping of hands of
their colleagues who had witnessed the
incident.
Representative Fordney of Michigan,
who, by the way, is one of the best sto
ry tellers of the house,
was once called as a
lumber expert in a
lawsuit at Saginaw.
hlq k;wye* The trial turned on the
question whether mer
ebantable lumber had been furnished
as provided in a onotract. The lawyer
on the pppoaing side was a very vocif
erous man, who shouted when be talked
-and who was also much given to
pounding the table with his fists.
"What do you regard as merchant
able lumber?' this attorney asked the
present representative on the cross ex
amiation.
"Why, lumber that san be sold at a
peoet," repied4 the wise Famdney.
Tbe lawyer pounded on the table, en
gaged in more loud talk and fnally
went at Mr. lbdney again.
"What would you regand as mer
chantable eotton?'
"I don't know anything about eot
"Ah, you don't, do youe, Wall, what
about meehbantabf pumpkin?'
"N-e'er s.aled pumpkins. I am a lm
b nre."
"Well, witas, what would you ay
about dabs and culls? Are they mer
ebantable lmaber?"
"They are the products of the mils."
"Ahr' yelled tbh lawyer again.
0 6tase tell q, wi s, whether you
have any ideas about any kind of mer
ehatable artiles."
"Ys,"1 responded the redoubtable
lordmey. "Take a lawyer, for unstance,
who tries his ease with his brains. I
would call him a merchantable lawyer,
but one who tries his case with his
mouth and his hands I would call a
