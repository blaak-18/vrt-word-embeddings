The Marriagemony of Miner ba White
iSERIES of dog barks,
human yelps, clatter of
rushing footsteps, and a
whirling form spun into
the room, tripped on a
rug and plunged against
the table, shattering the
decorum of Miss Patricia
Bratton’s dining-room,
where she and her nephew were seat
ed at their dignified two-o’clock din
ner.
The unexpected intruder’s physical
equilibrium restored, she postponed
all inquiries from the astounded Miss
Bratton by going off into spasms of
mirth, holding her sides and display
ing her perfect back teeth as she in
haled rather than exuded such excla
mations as “Cracky!”—“Lord hav’
mussy!”—“Dat dog!”
After subsiding into mere quivering
giggles, she seemed suddenly to re
member the object of her call, explain
ing exuberantly:
“I come to ax es you’s needin’ a
cook. Hope you didn’t burn yuhse’f
wid dat coffee I mek you spill—
thought that dog wuz gwine eat me
hat an’ shoes.”
The thing above all else on earth
Miss Bratton had been desiring for
ovre a week was a domestic, but this
cyclonic piece of black organism was
not the exact embodiment of what she
had hoped for.
Still, the time of the year was very
trying, and Miss Bratton was desper
ate.
“Are you an experienced cook?
Can you do housework?”
“Oh, yas’m! I kin do mos’ any
thing ’n dis worruld ’cep’n’ keepin’
still. I kin fry chick’n so it fairly
meks muh mouf dribble to think ov
it, an’ I cooks sparrow-grass dat ten
der it melt when you look at it, an’
de gumbo I cooks —Lordy, Miss, I’d
hate to waste tellin’ ’bout dat gumbo
■when you’s already full o’ dinner.”
“You have worked out before?”
(Miss Bratton was almost won.)
“Oh, yas’m. I’se worked at mos’
eberything ’cep’n’ breakin’ rocks wid
de chaingang.”
As to her name, the applicant
proudly stated it to be “Minerva
White.” Never was there a greater
misnomer! Minerva was squat, fat,
and as black as a freshly polished
stove.
When Miss Bratton decided, with
an unaccustomed impulsiveness, to
give the girl a trial, she little realized
she was entering into a partnership
that was to extend over an unlimited
period of years.
‘ 1 Inconsequential, ” “ irrepressi-
ble,” “irresponsible,” were all terms
Miss Bratton found herself using in
speaking of her new maid, but they
were invariably smoothed off by an
acknowledgment of Minerva’s imper
ishable good humor.
That such a blithe creature was sin
gle and care-free was a natural con
clusion, verified by an extremely
youthful appearance. The first day
the little spinster and her nephew,
Mr. William Ramsdale, age nineteen,
sat down to sample Minerva’s famous
tomato, okra and rice gumbo, she sad
ly recalled the savory description giv
en by the cook on the day of her ap-
plication, as she contrasted the scorch
ed flavor with Minerva’s peroration
on the subject.
On gently suggesting that the soup
was somewhat burned, the cook read
ily sympathized:
“Yas’m, it am a shame! You see,
I got kinder overhe’t an’ I sot out on
’de porch a minit to dry off, an’ I see
dat dog chewin’ up one o’ Billy’s
socks an’ I begunst to chase it an’ —”
“Minerva, you must not call Mr.
Ramsdale ‘Billy’; it is not respect
ful.”
“Ov course not. I’ll call ’m ‘Colo
nel’ es it’ll please you, Miss Patsy”;
and so she did, variating it according
to circumstance to “Gen’ral,” “Com
modo’ ” and even “Gov’nor. ”
Billy, being at an age susceptible
to flattery, became Minerva’s sworn
ally and defender whenever his aunt
desperately threatened discharge.
One morning Miss Bratton, between
sneezes, interrupted her maid’s song
ful bed-making by declaring:
“You see what 'a dreadful cold you
have caused me, Minerva, by failing
to tuck the bedclothes properly at the
foot of the bed, in spite of the fact
that I have shown you half a dozen
tirnfis how to do it. Now I will give
you one more lesson, and if it hap
pens again and my feet are exposed
to draughts, you will have to go, Mi
nerva. ’ ’
“Yas, Miss, I’se a’list’nin’ — I
’clare, Miss Patsy, you sech a pritty
lady I don’t see huccome you never
marry. ’ ’
“Minerva, I want no foolishness
whatever now; pay attention. You
see I tuck the sheet under the first
mattress this way and —”
“Miss Patsy, when you gits thru
wid dat dress you got on, giv’ it to
me, pleas’m.”
Miss Bratton passed out of the room
with a hopeless sigh, to find another
cause for grievance outside. Billy had
just gotten up and was clamoring for
breakfast. He had been out rather
later than his aunt suspected the night
before, and had found it expedient to
use his own window for entrance in
stead of the noisy front door.
Miss Bratton relieved herself at
length on the subject of Billy’s hab
its and Minerva’s worthlessness, be
fore entering the pantry to plan out
the day’s meals.
She shortly heard Minerva’s pref
acing giggle and commen
tary:
“We don’ min’ Miss Patsy’s fuss’-
ness, does we, ‘Admiral’?”
This was the last straw. Minerva
was told she could take her hat and
go. She left smilingly, but when she
calmly turned up the next morning,
remarking carelessly, “I know’d you
couldn’t git ’long widout me, when
you’s sick, so heah I is, an’ heah I’se
gwine stay tell you gits well,” Miss
Bratton had to confess she was glad.
When Minerva had been in her ser
vice for two months, Miss Patsy found
it necessary to hunt her domestic’s
abode one Sunday afternoon, in order
to tell her to come at five the next
morning, Billy having suddenly de
cided to start off on a camping trip
at an early hour.
She wended her way through the
3effersonlan
Sy Hanna Rion.
assortment of dilapidated shanties
back of the railroad shops, inquiring
along the way for Minerva White’s
house. A little unpainted cabin was
finally pointed out. In reply to her
knock a small voice cried out:
“Who dar?”
Miss Bratton declared herself.
“Wull, ma’s gone off ter a baptiz
in’ an’ I’se lock ’n de house.”
“Who is your mother?” Miss Brat
ton inquired.
“ ’Nerva’s muh mar, ma’am.”
Miss Bratton could scarcely believe
her ears; her surprise remained una
bated until her maid’s arrival the next
morning, when an explanation was re
quested.
“Lord, Miss, I thought eberybody
knows I’se married. Yas’m, I’se had
three chilluns, but I giv’ Abs’lum
(dat’s de oldes’) to muh ma fer a
Christmas present two years ago, an’
I giv’ Magd’len to muh sister fer a
weddin’ present, so I jes’ got S’phira
left on muh han’s now; but I hopes
to fin’ a home fer her, kase I ain’t
got no time to look arter chilluns, an’
muh husban’s too nervous to be wor
rit wid ’m.”
“What does your husband do?” —
Miss Bratton passed over the shock
ing irresponsibility of Minerva’s mo
therhood.
“He don’ do nothin’ much, his
health bein’ po’iy, but when he’s feel
in’ kinder peart he barbers some —den
he has a li’l’ luck at craps.”
“ What does Saphira—l believe you
said that is her name —what does your
little girl do all day while you are
here at work?”
“I feeds ’er an’ ’er daddy fo’ I
comes to wuk ’n de mornin’, den
Hampton (dat’s muh man) he gin
rully goes down-town fer de day, he
sayin’ how de doctor ’clare he need
all de ’citement he kin git fer his
health, an’ I locks S’phira ’n de house
tell I gits home at night.”
Miss Bratton was horrified to think
of the possibilities of the child being
burned, as so many of the negro chil
dren are under like conditions, so she
insisted that Saphira should be
brought each day.
The four-year-old pickaninny had
the run of the rear yard and the back
veranda, and was indeed but little in
the way. The kind old spinster felt
well content with her solution of Mi
nerva’s problems, until she one day
noticed, through the blinds of the din
ing-room, the barefooted Saphira tip
toeing stealthily away from the re
frigerator with mouth and both hands
crammed full of food.
The immediate thought of the
child’s evident hunger obliterated in
dignation, so the tender-hearted Miss
Bratton for some days provided Sa
phira with frequent lunches of bread,
butter, and sugar. The stuff in the
refrigerator, however, continued to
disappear with daily regularity.
Miss Bratton was in agony for fear
the mother would discover Saphira’s
thefts; memories of Minerva’s graph
ic delineation of hovy she had cured
Magdalen’s “light-fingeredness” by
hanging her up by the thumbs, made
the old maid shudder for Saphira’s
possible fate.
Miss Bratton was a woman of the-
ories and fine precepts; no one could
have been more astonished than she
when she found herself willing to abet
and shield Saphira by removing the
refrigerator to another and unap
proachable part of the house, replac
ing it with an old cupboard in which
she blushingly placed daily contribu
tions that she knew Saphira would en
joy abstracting as soon as her back
was turned.
But, alas for this kindly conspiracy!
Minerva’s watchful eye peered forth
one day to rest upon the purplish
heels of her offspring just as they
were twinkling noiselessly away from
the vicinity of the treasure-chest.
Poor Saphira! Miss Bratton, with
tears making canals of her wrinkles,
pleaded in vain for the young crim
inal. The inexorable mother yanked
the delinquent home, and tied her up
in a standing position for twelve hid
eous hours.
Minerva appeared at work next
morning with a smile of rare content
ment.
“I’se got rid ov ’er, Miss Patsy.
De new preacher ain’ got nairy chil
luns, an’ de congregation’s mekin’
dere donations to ’m now. I
ed as how I didn’t have nothin’ I
could give ’im ’less he’d like a chile.
His wife was jes tickled to deaf. So
S’phira’s got a home near de Lord
now, an’ I hopes de dev’l ’n ’er ’ll
tek to his heels.”
One day, after Minerva had been in
the Bratton service for almost two
years, the mistress discovered her
asleep in the best parlor chair when
she was supposed to be sweeping. The
minute Miss Bratton spoke Minerva
started up shouting:
‘ ‘ Creepin ’ Moses! Miss, dat’s wha ’
I gits fer dancin’ mos’ o’ de night.
It wuz jes muh foots dat wuz a-snor
in’, muh haid were wide ’wake all de
time.”
In earlier days Miss Bratton would
have taken this excuse literally, but
a gradual understanding of Minerva’s
character caused her to rivet her maid
for a more exact account of herself.
Minerva broke down for the first
time. With strangely tragic sobs she
confessed:
“Miss Patsy, you been so good to
me I jes ain’ gwine lie to you no mo’.
I ain’t been a-dancin’ ’tall. Lord,
honey, dese po’ foots o’ mine hasn’t
felt no pleasure fer so long dey’s fer
