Leopold’s Soul and President Taft
Friend Watson: —That SIO,OOO
obituary of yours on that mass of re
quiem for the Belgian reprobate is so
pungent that I shall not need to buy
any snuff for a month at least! I
want to dance and shout, and feel
ashamed enough of our President
Taft to cry, or fight, or learn to
swear.
To think that these people should
come over on the pretense of becom
ing identified with our institutions,
and should act the hog our Savior
predicted they would, if we “cast
our pearls of enfranchisement among
them, that they would trample them
under their feet, then turning round
would rend us.” Look at the gigan
tic impudence of their attacks upon
our schools —the very bulwark which
guards us from being as ignorant as
themselves. Ignorant, did I say?
and superstitious! I could take you
to one of their places—where an
archbishop was buried with great
pomp and circumstance: whose dead
feet are clothed with Irish hob-nailed
brogans to keep the fires of purga
tory from hurting the soles of his
holy feet. In one of his dead hands
is an English sixpence to pay St.
Peter, and in the other is a hammer
to knock at the door of heaven with.
I am ashamed of our Unitarian
President, who has fastened Rome
upon the Filippinos so tyranically
that they are groaning under priestly
bondage.
Oh, if only a Southern man would
rise and invite Americans to rescue
us from the premeditated rape of
1912. There are enough of us to
elect an American President and kick
these enemies of our institutions to
where they came from.
I am so glad that such a one -as
Thomas Watson dares to write as you
do.
But there is a prophesy on these
Canaanites, uttered by Noah, which
should be laid before the American
people. In Genesis, 9:25, we read
that Noah got drunk and, like men
when they are drunk, was careless
of the decencies and his son Ham,
who had a filthy mind, saw him, and
instead of respectfully making things
right he went to his two brothers,
Shem and Japheth. His brothers,
however, took a covering and, walk
ing backwards, covered their father.
The “old man” was not so drunk
but what he knew of the matter, and
on the morrow, when he was sober
ed, he said; “Cursed be Canaan, a
servant of servants shall he be unto
his brethren.” Now, we know that
Canaan peopled Phoenicia, Tyre,
Sidon, and, indeed, all Palestine,
which is called “The Land of Ca
naan” to this day. We know, also,
that these people were great colon
izers, Spain, Gaul, Italy, Ireland are
their descendants, and Pappy Sarto,
as you call him, identifies himself
with them, subscribing himself as “a
servant of servants” —servus servo
rum Dei —and, with his mitre shaped
like a fish-head, he further identi
fies himself with Dag-On, the fish
god of Phoenicia. One of these Pap
pies, named Adrian IV., gave them
into subjection to Henry 11. of Eng
land, and the harp of Erin —which
really was the harp of David —got
into the quarterings of the British
standard , and they have been “ser
vants of servants” ever since, even
to this day, when they are repaying
our kindness to them by fleecing us
everywhere, and have had the im
pudence to imagine that we Ameri
cans are going to take our religion
from the descendants ofx Goliath of
Gath, instead of from the Hebrew
Messiah of Whom we read in our Bi
bles, and which they hate so much
as to forbid its being read in our
schools, hoping that they can force
us to accept a Dago Pappy as our
teacher.
If Americans will only call on the
Mighty Deliverer of Israel and get
together as loyal followers of Wash
ington, Jefferson, Jackson, et al.,
that word which has recorded that
“the Canaanite was then in the land”
when Abraham arrived there, Gene
sis, 12:6, also has shown that a time
is coming “When there shall no
more be the Canaanite in the house
of Jehovah.” Zach., 14: 21.
So, now, I urge you to write up
our rulers when they so far forget
themselves as to go to mass with
them for the repose of such a wretch
as Leopold of Belgium, who commit
ted such a largesse of cruelty to the
poor people of the Congo.
If they think so much of him, let
them go with him.
Where is that American who is to
lead Americans against “these un
circumcised dogs of Philistines?”
Yours for American institutions,

Watson and Missions
Perhaps no man has been more
misunderstood by the clergy, who
have failed to read Mr. Watson in
the original, on the subject of For
eign Missions.
Mr. Watson’s criticism was not on
the principle of missions, but on our
methods. By methods he had refer
ence to our secular education, with
schools, free board, and free hospit
als, etc.
His point was that under prevail
ing conditions, the South paying tariff
tribute to the North, and paying pen
sions for Northern soldiers, and vic
tim to Northern legislation, and the
North through its religious denomi
nations, raising millions and millions
for endowment of negro schools and
colleges, and refusing a dollar for
white colleges, or hospitals, that it
was our duty, the duty of organized
religious bodies, to offset what the
North was doing, and look to the
education of our illiterate whites. He
regarded this as statesmanship, look
ing to the future.
The North invaded the South after
the War and established secular
schools as its plan of missionary
work, confining its work to negroes
only. And to educate the negroes for
political purposes, it spent millions
and millions in endowment of negro
schools, and refused to aid any white
college or hospital.
When the North invaded us we
went to Japan and Korea and China;
our plan was secular schools, same
plan as the Yankees applied to the
South. Mr. Watson saw what this
would finally result in and he ap
pealed to all Southern denominations
to come home and offset what was
being done to put the negro over the
white man.
The clergy resented this, but such
was Mr. Watson’s desire.
He is not opposed to the principle
of Foreign Missions, but under pre
vailing conditions, since Appomattox,
the white South is a mere province in
the Northern grasp. He thinks we
can not educate secularly Japan and
Korea and China and Cuba, and leave
our own South to the Yankees to en
dow negro colleges and schools, to
prepare negroes for future voters to
be above the illiterate whites at the
polls—offensive to Northern philan
thropy, who favor negroes instead.
Such are Mr. Watson’s ideas. Os
course, some hold his views in con
tempt. They are the negro side of
the proposition.—Jas. Callaway in
