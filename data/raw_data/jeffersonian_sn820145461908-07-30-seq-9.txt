Crisp does not deny the statement of Mr.
Lewis?
“After the caucus,” Mr. Bryan voted
for my father. Just so. He had to, or be
read out of his party.
But in the caucus, he continued to
throw away his vote on Springer, for the
reason, as he explained to Lew r is, “I don’t
think I care to face the old soldier ele
ment along the Platte with record t'of
having voted for an ex-Confederate.”
Young Mr. Crisp corroborates Mr.
Lewis.
Dear Bryanites, we’ve got you on the

"Prohibition Byranites.
The Jeffersonian begs to offer its pro
found sympathy to those Bryanites who
are ardent Prohibitionists, at the same
time that they are fervent Bryanites. Be
tween their ardor in the one direction,
and their fervor in the other, these breth
ren are going to have a racking time of
it.
For, as all of you know, the only time
the Peerless One was brought to book on
the whiskey issue, he landed on the
liquor side; and during this year of grace,
1908, when the wicked saloonists of Lin
coln, Nebraska, were walloping the right
eous, Bryan was hard at work on his
alibi. In other words, the Peerless One
skipped out of Nebraska and stayed out,
until the scrimmage was over. Didn’t
mean to damage his halo by taking either
side, you see.
And while that ostentatious drenching
of the newspaper men with “unfermented
grape-juice,” was a sop thrown to us
Prohibitionists, still our hearts are sore
because in all of Bryan’s oceans of talk
and seas of writing, there floats not a sin
gle little Prohibition bark. .
But to make the situation even more
painful to us Prohibitionists, Bryan has
picked out, for his running mate, the law
yer whose chief aim in life has been to
work for the Brewers of Indiana. Kern
is a liquor-dealer-Association sort of law
yer. Stays in that employment, regu
larly. Is the permanent legal champion
of the Brewers. It’s his job, don’t you
know?
Bryan knew it, just as he knew what
kind of “sport” Tom Taggart was.
In 1896, Bryan, the crusading reform
er, refused to associate with Taggart, the
gambling-hell keeper, of French Lick
Springs.
Now that Bryan has lost his own po
litical virtue, no companionship is too low
for him. Roger Sullivan, Charles Mur
phy, Tom Taggart, and Tom’s under
study, Kern, are all equally congenial to
the man who wrote that Denver plat
for me, and who is making that play for
the negro vote.
Os course, the Prohibition Bryanites
will vote for Bryan and Kern —but we feel
sorry for them. It’s mighty tough on the
brethren to have to line up for a ticket
composed of a Brewers’ Association law-

Bryan and Clebeland.
What W. J. B.
said of Grover, at
Urbana, Ohio, four
years ago:
“The Democrats
in 1892 played a
confidence game on
the people and put
a bunco steerer at
the head of the
party.”
The “bunco steer
er” was Grover
Cleveland, of
course.

Boosebelt and 'Bryan.
We can’t all be smart, and eloquent,
and popular, and successful —but could
not most men be men, if they cared and
and dared?
Is there any prouder compliment which
can be paid than is implied in the words,
“He is, every inch, a man”?
To sav what one believes to be the
truth, without a timorous stopping to
think that it may provoke others to an
ger; to do what one honestly thinks a
duty, regardless of how many friends may
drop away —that’s manliness; and it is a
standard which almost every man could
attain if he would.
Consider Bryan and Roosevelt, in the
matter of sheer, elemental manhood.
Wasn’t it the height of manliness when
Roosevelt took the side of the South and
of right, in that Brownsville affair —risk-
ing the entire loss of the negro vote and
the breaking up of his own party into
warring factions?
And isn’t it most unmanly in Bryan
to have private talks with the insurgent
negro leaders, telling them something in
private, which sends them away exultant
and converted? Would a manly man re
sort to such methods?
The negroes have thrust the Browns
ville case into the campaign. Months ago
they threatened to do it. They organized
for that very purpose. They have never
ceased to agitate for the re-instatement of
the troops whom Roosevelt summarily
dismissed from the army. The chiefs of
the organized negroes went to see Mr.
Bryan. They went to talk to him about
Brownsville and the disgraced soldiers.
They did talk to him on those very sub
jects. After doing so, they rushed into
print to tell the country that Mr, Bryan’s

Ihe Denver Conven

manship . . . and
by his able, con
sc i ent i ous, and
forceful administra
tion of public af
fairs reflected honor
upon his country
and the party.”
Having gone over
to W all Street,

attitude on those matters was satisfac
tory to them. Following this announce
ment, the chiefs of the negro clubs and
leagues, heretofore invariably Republican,
have announced their intention of sup
porting the Democratic ticket.
Yet Bryan declares that Brownsville is
not an issue in the campaign, and that he
will not discuss it.
A manly man would never be guilty of
such conduct.
Take the Standard Oil case, where
Judge Grosscup, a corporation man, has
reversed Judge Landis, and relieved the
Rockefeller crew of that $29,000,000 fine.
As soon as the decision was made
known Roosevelt blazed out, in wrath, de
nouncing the decision, proclaiming the
guilt of the corporation, and declaring
that it would be a gross miscarriage of
justice if the criminal escaped punish
ment. He didn’t stop to calculate how
his excoriation of the court and of the cor
poration might hurt Taft, or himself. He
felt deeply, and he spoke boldly, like a
man.
How was it with the Peerless One, out
in Nebraska?
He stopped to calculate and —said noth
ing.
The white plume is one thing; the
white feather is quite another. When our
Young Lochinvar came out of the West,
in 1896, it seemed to be a white plume
that nodded on his crest; but there’s no
question of plume in 1908.
Since his determination to barter the
convictions of a life-time for the support
of the Wall Street element of his party, it
contents him to show the white feather.
The Bryan of 1908, the “Lost Leader”
of radicalism, is not entitled to wear any
other emblem. The white feather is the
appropriate badge.

Negro Domination.
It has no terrors for the Bryanites. For
years and years the Southern States have
been moving heaven and earth to keep
the negro politician from becoming the
umpire of disputes between the whites.
By all sorts of contrivances, poll tax laws,
white primaries, and disfranchisement
acts, we have been trying to remove from
State politics the menace of negro domi
nation.
How great, then, is our amazement
when we consider that our Southern poli
ticians regard with complacency the deal
which Mr. Bryan has made with negro
leaders in Ohio, Indiana, and the District
of Columbia.
Could there be anything more deplor
able than the establishment of a prece
dent which will hereafter encourage the
negro leaders every four years, to invite
bids from the candidates of opposing
parties? •
Mr. Gompers wanted certain things
conceded to organized labor. He applied
to the Republicans, and was turned down.
