The "Model" Chief Justice.

under the ban of negroes even, pro
duce such a man for its head of the
Supreme bench as our Judge Lewd.

R. H., and bought in the road himself ;'
which some friend has aptly remarked
was the first tinie he had ever known
a nian to stettl a rail-road and get
away with it. But the funny part
comes in when we read the decision
of the Supremie Court of the United
States, setting aside the sale and di
rectly charging Mhr (t) Ietwd-ling with
fraud in the Itiatter. Ye Gods! a Su
preme Judge of a State fonud guilty
of fraud. Well, nothing could be ex
pected of a man who would tell a bare
face lie to h;s own townsmen, to save
from arrest such a wretch as Seelye.

Scnator Allen Greene produced the
parish of Lincoln at the last meeting
of the Legislature, The parish was
madle up of odds and ends frout all
the neighboring parishes, and was, it
was thought, Radical.
Since the inauguration of the par
ishi by Col. Greene, the Greene's lhave
been sorely treated there. They have
been totally ignored. The generous
action of Col. Greene was not appre
i:ated and rewarded by his consti
tuents of the parish; indeed, other
persons have held all the offices and
left the Greene's entirely in the cold.
The family has been without offices,
as the following will show:
Col. Allen green, Senator, also hold
ing several other small offices.
W. L. Greene, Tax Collector,
C. J. Greene, Parish Judge.
C. Greene, ex-Representative, Would
like to be so again.
J. A. 4ireene, supervisor of regis
tration and map maker for the parish.
A few other Greenes hold small posi
tions. The Police Jury were appoint
ed by the Governor at the request of
the Greene's.
It will thud be seen that the Greene
family had some little influence in
Lincoln parish, yet not as much as
their services deserved. It wAs against
this family combination that the peo
pie of Lincoln rose some months be
fore the election, demanding that the
Greene's should do their duty, as the
law ps ide4s-vesigu.
This was the offense for which the
Lincoln arrests were made. This the
crime for which Seelye with his troops
scoured over the country with arrests
for two hundred citizens. They had
dlistrbedothe quiet and unobstructive

Now that the election is over and
our people have achieved a glorious
victory, which must gladden the heart
of every potriotic wouman in our be

get up a party or ball in honor of the
occasion.
Yours respectfully,

We know that our young men can
not resist that appeal. Let them by
all means give us one of their usual

matter before them ; and we trust
Beauty will soon have an opportunity
to dante a minuet in honor of the
People's victory. We think it would
take a regular old Virginia break
down to give vent to our feelings.
CITY IOTEL.-We trust that the
citizens of North Louisiana, and of
our parish especially, will remember
on visiting New Orleans the kindness
extended to the prisoners from Nat

gentlemanly and patriotic proprietor
of the CITY HoI'r:L, and make it a
point to be his guests. We can as
sure them of hospitable treatment and
liberal charges. We again take pleas
ure in extending our thanks to Col.
Morse and wish him a long life of
usefulness. The City Hotel is now
in charge of Messrs. Mumford & Wat

men and we bespeak for then the
liberal patronage of our people,

a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and eauCnty of the ALrINEw will ha
most appreciatedl after it has been htand
up at the close.of the year. While other
joutrnals iniy claim nsuplerior eheapness, :as
compared with I' -rals of a similar class,
the ALNIISE is a uniiqne and original con

chala;ttor. The possessor of a complete

A lIT DE PA RTMl ENrT, 1874.
The, illustrations or the ALInra have
wona world-wide reputation,. and in the
art centres of Europe it. is an admitted Afct
that its wood cuts are examples of the
highest perfection ever attained. The
coimonim prejudice in favor of 'steel plates'
is rapidly yielding to a more educated and
discriminaLing taste which recognizes the
advantages and superior artistic quan:ty
with greater ftleility of production. The
wood-cuts of the ALDInE possess a:ll t lhe
delicacy and elaborate finish of the most
costly steel plate, while they aflord a bet
ter rendering of the artist's original.
To fully realize the wondu-ful work
which the Aldine is doing for the cause of
art culture in America, it is only neces
sary to consider the cost to the people of
any other decent ropresentaitions of the
prodtlutions of great painters.
In ndtlition to designs by the members
of the National Academy and other noted
American artists, the Aldine will repro
d tce examples of the best foreign masters,
selected with a: view to tile highest artis
tic success and greatest general interest.
Thus the subscriber to the Aldine will, at
a trilling cost, enjoy in his own hioue the
pleasures and relining influences of true
art.
The quarterly tinted plates for 1874 will
be by Thos. Moran alt J.1. 1. Woodward.
The Christmas issue for 1874 will con
tain special designs appropriate to the
season, hy our best artists, and will sur
pa-s in attractions any of its pradecessors
Preminums for 1874.
Every subscriber to the Aldine for 1874
will receive a pair of chronmos. The orig
inal pictures were painted in oil for the
publishers of the Aldine, by Thomas Mo
r whose great Colorado picture was
ased by Congress for ten thousand
ars. 'The subjects were chosen to rep
nt • The East" antd "The West." One
is a view of tie White Mountains, New
Hampshire; the other gives the cliffs of
Green River, Wyoming Territory. The
difference in the nature of the scenes
themselves is a pleasing contrast. and af
fords a good display of the artist's scope
and col6ring. The chromos are each work
ed fromnt thirty distinct plates, and are in
size (12 by 1i;) and appearance exact fac
sinmiles of the originals. The presentation
of a worthy example of America's greatest
landscape painter to the eunecribers of the
Aldine was a bI6 nout peculiarly happy
anca, and its successful realization is at
tested by the following testimonial, over
the signature of Mr. Moran himself:
Newark, N. J., Sept- 20, 1813.
Messrs. James 8uttona & Co.,
Gentlemen--I am delightedmi with the
proofs in color of your chromnos. They are
wonderfally succeaNful representations by
mechanical proces.s of the original paint
ings. Very Respectfully,
ThomAs Mou.',
These rchromos are in every sense Amer
ican. They are by an originald American
proceses, with materials of American man
ufactire, from designs of American scene
ry by an American painter, and presented
to bscribers to the first successful Art
Journal. If no better because of all this.
they will certaitly possess an interest no
foreign production can inspire, and neither
are they any the worse if by reason Iof pe
culiar faciltites of production they cost
the puplishers only a trifle, while EQUAL
in every respect to other ehromos that are
sold singly for DOUBLE the subscription
price ofthe AuwINi. Perseonms of taste
will prize these pictures for thelnmselves-
not for the price they did or did not cost,
and will apnreciate the enterprise that
renders their distribhtion possible.

The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished. j
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821. ,
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post Iha been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread anri nlbleloniishied reputation
for the ltusurpasse4 purity, retinenteiht
and excellence of the Serials, Skettlhes
and Miscellaneous reading miatter.
It is pro-emiuently
The Best Family Papero
that is published in this counntry, from its
never containing anything that would
otffend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not he read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, ats its yodnger contenllmporaries,
is not, like that of soihe of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
iTURE, SOLIDt) AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon tlhe intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post hlmIs been in the past, it is .onr
intention to murake it still better in the
future, and with this.oblject in view we
will effect a mnarked inprovement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability an4 known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and ajdingla many judicioiis and pleas
ing novelties, by studying lhow to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by iu
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarge'd facilities, wdluope to make new

continue to maintain the claimn of the
