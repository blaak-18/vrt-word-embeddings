case of sickness and emergency.
There is but one saloon in Tennes
see not covered by the Prohibition
law, which is not as rigid as Geor
gia’s. The Tennessee Oasis, located on
top of a mountain and is run by Jack
Cunningham. It is stated that he
has bought or has an option on all
land for four miles around, so that
no school house or church can be
erected.
It has been held a fraudulent use
of the mails for any one in the inter
est of strikers “to com-
A Question, municate by letter with
strikebreakers offering
them positions in other towns when
such positions do not exist.”
This decision was reached in the
Federal Court in the case of a mem
ber of the Machinist Union in Colo
rado who induced non-union men
during the machinist strike there to
leave Denver on promise of job in
Kansas City.
Query: Would the court hold it a
ingudulent use of the mails if non
union strikebreakers were induced to
come on promise of work during a
strike of union men when the in
ducing concern knew that the jobs
were but-’temporary and that no pro
visions were made for the strike
breakers once a settlement had been
arrived at?
There seems to be a genejal senti
ment aroused about this evil. The
recent proposal o f
Pistol Toters. Congressman Sisson of
Mississippi to levy a
tax upon deadly weapons is a timely
one. His tax proposition would act
in two ways—bring a revenue and
shift the burden from the honest
shoulder to the dishonest shoulder
and at the same time discourage the
carrying of deadly implements which
prompt men to violence.
This is a knotty problem when
some recent decisions- are considered.
It has been the frequent habit of of
ficers to arrest men for one offense
and finding a concealed weapon, to
prefer charges for carrying concealed
weapons, and almost without excep
tion convicting them. Recently in
Thomas County two negroes were ar
rested for jumping a contract. They
were not convicted but they were
both caught with concealed weapons
on their person. They were prose
cuted and the Court ruled that it was
illegal to convict them as they were
not arrested for carrying concealed
weapons and although they were
found with the weapons they were
acquitted. It is not constitutional to
arrest a man on suspicion of carry
ing concealed weapons and then con
vict him even if they are found. This
is a very delicate legal point and was
brought to my attention by a mem
ber of the House of Representatives,
now in session, and who was present
at the trial of the two negroes, and
saw them acquitted and gave the
names of the Judge, and the lawyer
who was appointed to defend them.
There is no question of more im
port than the above one, but none
harder to find a solution for.
We are glad to see that Messrs.
Lord and Joiner of Washington
County are digging away at it. They
have introduced a bill “to require the
registration of all weapons carried
on persons.”
Some parts of this State, where
turpentine and sawmills are located
negroes go armed with Winchester
rifles, and it is worth a man’s life to
question his right to trespass on his
property.
Last week a negro insulted an un
protected woman on the suburbs of
Atlanta. It was reported that he was
caught. In a short time one of the
hardware stores of this city sold out
of pistols and the purchasers were
negroes. They were indignant at the
thought that a negro was about to be
punished for his insult and attempt
to assault a white woman. Certainly
there is some protection against this
great evil and we will be glad when
somebody digs it up.
A contract has been recently let
for erecting a plant in Cordele for
making paper from
Paper Made of cotton stalks. This
Cotton Stalks, about consumes all
the cotton plant and
makes another valuable asset for the
South. Not so many years ago the
farmer thought little of the value of
the cotton seed and I have seen them
thrown out promiscuously. They fed
them to stock and made compost and
used some for fertilizer but had more
than they knew what to do with.
Now the demand by the oil mills is
far greater than the supply, now
comes the value of the stalk.
John Moore of Macon planted an
enormous crop of okra and has had
experiments made with this stalk to
manufacture paper therefrom and it
has proven successful. Consumers
have been somewhat alarmed for fear
of a scarcity of paper on account of
the devastations of the forest and
consequently the wood pulp, but it
seems that the South will be able to
supply this demand.
SOME SWEET DAY.
Some time or other, says Harper’s
Weekly, soon, maybe, it will come
home to the American people that
high protection has an ethical side
which deserves their attention. That
side of it was put forward in few
words the other day by Senator Dol
liver, when he said in a speech in the
Senate:
“As the result of my observations
upon the different tariffs of the
world (and I do not pretend to be
wise or deeply read about this mat
ter), I find that wherever there is a
protective tariff it has built up a sys
tem of morality of its own, and I
never found that its rules of morals
were in accord with any other rules
of morals, religious or secular, ever
framed in this world. It has built
up a system of morality in this coun
try that not only is wicked, but it al
lows to be done by authority of law
what the man who does it would nev
er do in his private capacity as a cit
izen. It permits a man not only to
covet his neighbor’s goods, but to
take them away from him by force
of law. When we consider that we
collected a little over $300,000,000
last year, and the people of this coun-
Jeffersonian
try pay in taxation to these protected
interests $2,100,000,000, I think it
is about time we are considering
whether we are not taxing the Amer
ican people a little too far.”
Senator Dolliver has done a great
deal to help the country to see high
protection as it really is, Harper’s
thinks. Whenever the country does
see it so, revision downward will be
come a moral issue of a sort that the
