I PAPER.
The Commoner, Mr. Bryan's ppa,
will be especially interesting and in
Lstructive during the present session of
Congress. The action of this Congress
' -will probably determine the issues.upon
w hich the next presidential campaign
U will be fought. The Commoner proposes
to carry.,on a campaign for education
and organization to the end that Demo
cratic principles may triumph.
In addition to the editorial depart
ment. which receives Mr. Bryan's per
Ssongl attention. The Commoner contains
-a -Current Topic department. wherein a
" non- partisan discussion of topics of
- timely interest and other valuable in
formation will he found. The Home De
+prtm.ent is conducted b an experienced
. woman who is widely known as a writ
er of household topics and who is an
,a'uthority on the art of cooking in all
that the thetr implies. This department
v alone is worth the subscription price.
ý The other, departments of the paper are
all *interesting and, ably conducted.
