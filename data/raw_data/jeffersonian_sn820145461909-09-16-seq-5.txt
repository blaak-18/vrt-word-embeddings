Death of
Harriman.
blasted tomb upon his princely es
tate.
None would judge the dead, who
may be now before the Great Judge.
Many an editorial has been writ
ten, many a sermon will be preached,
striving to draw some lesson from
the life and death of this man, who,
living, was a king in actual wielding
of power and who, dead, takes noth
ing of his vast riches with him.
And yet the chiefest point that
shines out seems to be that the world
is strangely, inconsistently kind!
Many a poor man who had nothing
—not even the certainty of being
able to work —will gently say that
Harriman was but supremely suc
cessful, that, if he had been in Har
riman’s place, he would have done
the same. The laboring world does
not hate those who have wealth.
Pity perhaps that they are so patient,
so tolerant, so grateful for a kind
word now and then that they can
forgive all the wrongs that caste, and
class put upon them.
Harriman succeeded in piling up
wealth because the laws of the land
permitted so great an accumulation
and because no law in the land pre
sumed to touch such wealth by any
adequate income tax, or will touch it
now by any adequate inheritance tax.
Harriman is poor as the poorest to
day—yet his heirs will have wealth
beyond all realization; $50,000,000
to $500,000,000 —no one can grasp
what such sums mean. We use the
terms, we do not comprehend the
sense of them, at all. It is too stu
pendous.
Harriman belonged to an “era of
great fortunes”. Nero and Caligula
belonged to an era of great debauch
ery. Excuse perhaps we may, but
only the snob could surround the de
ceased with an odor of sanctity. We
realize human weakness, how prone
it is to take advantage of beneficial
situations, but we should change
those situations and equalize oppor
tunities. No glory is great enough
to cover greed, and greed is sordid,
whether it applies to power, or mon
ey, or any other thing that takes
from the many to give to the few.
Mr. Harriman’s achievement was the
downing of business rivals—but al
ways the people furnished the am
munition, the supplies over which
they fought. Many of these rivals
paid him homage at the funeral at
Arden, —and will proceed this week
to struggle for the continued control
of the people’s property. The North,
Arden, N. Y., last
week, and all that is
mortal of him was
laid away in a rock-
the South, the East and the West,
pour their wealth into a pool, and it
is absorbed by the strongest, or the
luckiest, manipulator of stocks. Then
we gape at, admire and fawn upon
the winner.
In a selfish world Harriman elect
ed to be selfish and a vast concourse
of people followed him to the tomb,
the papers were full of details, the
railroads were in mourning. And
those who, in a selfish world, elect to
be self-abnegating, are laid away by
a handful of faithful friends, per
haps, and die, if an ungrateful peo
ple do not kill them otherwise, of
broken hearts. Radiant Justice has
never yet had her abode on earth.
The world is strangely, inconsist
ently kind—and cruel.

HOW TO GET OTHERS TO DO
YOUR WORK.
Some years ago the general super
intendent of the Wabash Railroad
was one A. A. Talmage. Talmage
had the bark on like an _Ali Baba
Bench.
This man Talmage was no kins
man of the preacher family by that
name—not exactly. He had a vo
cabulary that was at once pictures
que, pungent and permeating. When
Talmage was excited he would moo
like a cow, laugh like a calf and bel
low like a bull. No one could tell
at such times whether he was pleased
or wroth —his irony and praise were
so much alike that no one could tell
which was which. Time alone was
the revealer.
As a railroad man he wanted the
thing done and done right; and a
course as captain on a Mississippi
steamboat had fixed upon him a
pleasant knock-down-and-drag out
habit of speech. ■ ‘
Talmage was what Boston folks
call Western.
And it so happened that Talmage
was going over the road on a trip of
inspection and stopped at Peru, In
diana. The agent there was a new
man, quite a young fellow, Alexander
Robertson by name. It seems he had
never seen Talmage nor had Talmage
seen him. Talmage came rooting
through the office asking forty ques
tions and not waiting for an answer
to any. At last he growled, “Are you
the agent?” “Yes,” said the young
man.
“Well, where’s your desk?” de
manded Talmage.
“I haven’t any—l don’t do any
work. I just see that others do it,”
was the answer, given with a touch
of acerbity.
The truth was that the agent’s roll
top desk had that morning been sent
up to the local furniture man for re
pairs.
“No desk!” roared Talmage, “well
by the great hellity devilty dam, you
are the only genuine man of brains
I’ve seen since I shaved this morning.
I’ll Make you a Division Superinten
dent, that’s what I’ll do, by the great
jumping jehosaphat! Here I pay
men superintedent’s pay and they do
agent’s work, and I pay men agent’s
pay and they do office boy’s work. A
man who has no desk and gets others
to do all the work is a great man—
"Seffersoniait
I’ll make you a Division Superinten
dent!”
And Talmage rushed for his pri
vate car,
Robertson didn’t know whether he
was to be discharged or promoted.
But in a few days when there came
along a sober and sane letter from
Talmage’s secretary, making a few
minor criticisms and commending
the order of his office, he felt re
lieved. The more Robertson thought
about what Talmage had said, the
more he believed Talmage was right;
the valuable man is one who can suc
cessfully direct the efforts of others.
Robertson set himself the task of do
ing nothing where he could get some
one else to do it. This gave him leis
ure to plan and think and devise.
His work never chased him —he
chased the work. His promotion
came by sure and safe steps, and Tal
mage did just what he had promised,
and not because he had promised it
either. Robertson created a system;
and moreover he did not get nerv.
pros, in one operation. Nerv. pros,
comes from letting your work chase
you.
If you have a man working for
you at twenty dollars a week and he
insists on doing work which an
eight-dollar-a-week girl can do, he is
robbing you of just twelve dollars a
week. —The Philistine.

would put themselves to the trouble
of doing it, and endure the embar
rassment of having a “simple”
around.
It is so in all other asylums, why
not in Georgia? It may also be en
tirely true that many an unfortunate
receives better material things there
than his own people could afford to
give him but these are not really to
the point. The truth seems to be,
t .at ALL, no matter how they got
there, or why they ought to remain,
or their previous position, are board
ed for .34 per day, a sum so pitifully
small as to carry its own tale of un
derfeeding, etc., inevitably with it.
And the well-authenticated instances
of actual cruelty have been numer
ous.
Don’t take it personally to heart,
“George Martin”. In an orphanage
(Methodist, we believe) in Virginia,
a case of barbarous cruelty was very
recently exposed; and in another or
phanage of (probably) Baptist de
nomination, in Louisiana, a little boy
was lashed with fiendish brutality;
and in many institutions, state and
otherwise, the probe is being justly
employed. The great Bellevue Hospit
al, not many years ago, developed a
bad case of horrors, and had to be
summarily cleaned up. It is necessary
that the State of Georgia get busy
and remain vigilant. The trouble is
not that an investigation now pends,
but that it has been so long deferred
that the institution has had a chance
to become over-crowded, poorly man
aged, and full of abuses that must be
abolished.
But we hope the innocent nurse or
attendant will help in the good work,
and not resent to do what it is im
perative must be done.
