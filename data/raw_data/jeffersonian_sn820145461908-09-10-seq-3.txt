PLBASING POINTS FOB POPULISTS
ALABAMA.
To the Populists of Alabama:
I have received letters from Popu
lists all over the State wanting to
know if Alabama would have an elec
toral ticket. At a meeting of the
State Executive Committee at Bir
mingham on July 4 an electoral tick
et was put into the field, and this
ticket appears in another column of
this paper. We are unfortunate in
not being able to get our movements
before the people. The Democratic
newspapers ignore us. They won’t
even “cuss” us—that would help
some.
The Alabama Populist, published at
(Selma, has been doing all it could do
to keep our people posted, but owing
to the fact that it is practically in
its infancy, its circulation is compara
tively small, and consequently the
people remain uninformed. Con
fronted by this condition of affairs,
it is the duty of every Populist in
the State who does know to do all
the work he can to get Populism be
fore his neighbors.
I have also received some very en
couraging letters iMen who have nev
er voted anything but the Democratic
ticket are going with us this time.
Information comes from several parts
of the 'State that Watson will get a
majority at various places. An ef
fort is being made to carry Henry
county. Crenshaw Populists say
their county will give Watson a
big vote, and like reports come from
other counties.
I have sent the names of all the
parties who have written me to Hon.
Jay W. Forrest, National Chairman,
of Albany, N. Y. He will send liter
ature to all of them, and I request
that they distribute it among their
friends. It will have a good effect.
Enclose a few stamps or a money or
der in an envelope and address it to
People’s Party Headquarters at Al
bany. They need money and stamps
to distribute this literature and car
ry on the campaign work.
Every county in the State should
be -organized. Call a county conven
tion and get the ball to rolling.
The November election is going to
be an eye-opener.
Yours for the fight,
J. ROY M’GINTY.
Opelika, Ala., Sept. 3, 1908.
VIRGINIA POPULISTS.
All Virginians who believe in the
principles of Jeffersonian Democracy
and desire to support Watson and
Williams, the greatest advocates of
these principles, for President and
Vice President of these United
States, are requested to communicate
with the undersigned. Remember the
influence your party has exerted on
others, and don’t say we are too few,
but show the same determination
that was shown in the days of Jack
son and Lincoln, when these parties
started.

FOR ORGANIZATION.
Whereas, the present presidential
campaign is one of vital importance
to the best interests of the people of
our common country:
Resolved: First, That we, the
Populists of Forsyth county, Georgia,
do reaffirm our faith in the final tri
umph of the principles as set forth
in the Omaha platform of 1883 and
heartily commend the same for the
earnest consideration of all good cit
izens of our entire country.
Resolved: Second, Realizing that
in union there is strength, and that
the most sacred civil right of the
American citizen is that of the prop
er use of the ballot box, we cordial
ly invite all true reformers, irrespect
ive of past political differences, in
carrying our banner of “Equal rights
to all and special privileges to none, ’ ’
to a glorious victory in our beloved
Georgia.
We have, at our masthead, the
names of two true and tried Chris
tian patriots who have been weighed
in the balances and not found want
ing. The name of Thos. E. Watson,
as a noted national, renowned Chris
tian statesman and historian,
is fast becoming of household dis
tinction. As ian able exponent of our
long cherished republican form of
government, founded upon true De
mocracy, he stands today without a
pier and should our old ship of state
become stranded upon the rocks of
modern plutocracy, his name will go
down in history alongside of those
of Jefferson, Jackson 'and Lincoln,
who devoted their public lives to keep
her in her proper moorings. We
quote again from the Farmers’ Al
liance and Industrial Union: “Truth
crushed to earth will rise again.”
These reasons set forth, we hope
all true lovers of liberty will
come up with their ballots at the
November election and cast them for
Watson and Williams, giving the elec
toral vote of the Empire State of the
South to her much to he honored and
devoted son, the Honorable Thos. E.
Watson.
On organization we unanimously
elect as county chairman and secre
tary, R. P. Roggers, chairman, and V.
W. Daugherty, secretary. To assist
them in completing the organization,
we suggest the following named per
sons whom we insist will at once pro
ceed to call mass meetings and form
Watson and Williams clubs.
Cumming district, Furman Wil
liams, A. J. Green.

POPULIST RALLIES IN FOUR
COUNTIES.
Col. F. D. Wimberly Will be Present
and. Make Talk at Each.
The Populists, including all those
who are now supporting the Hon.
Thomas E. Watson for President, are
about to enter upon an active organi
zation campaign which will cover
thoroughly the entire section. Mr.
Watson himself will come to this
part of the state in a week or two
and make a number of speeches, and
his followers are planning to greet
him in great and enthusiastic crowds.
County organizations have already
been effected in several counties of
the second congressional district and
it is the intention of the campaign
committee that the work be carried
on until every county in the district
shall have been put in working order.
Then the hardest work of the cam
paign will have been fairly begun.
Next week, the center of activity
will be in Colquitt, Thomas, Grady
and Mitchell counties. Dates have
been made for rallies in each of
these counties as follows:
Colquitt Moultrie, Wednesday,
September 2.
Thomas Ochlocknee, Friday,
September 4.
Grady—i Cairo, Thursday, Septem
ber 3,
Mitchell—-Pelham, Saturday, Sep
tember 5.
Col. F. D. Wimberly, of Cochran,
Pulaski county, a well known speak
er of power and ability, a member of
the “Old Guard,” will be present at
each of these meetings and a great
time is assured all those who come
out. The meetings are being widely
advertised and no doubt good crowds
will be attracted.
If you ever were a Populist, or
have made up your mind to be no
longer a political slave, come out to
one of these meetings. A very cor
dial invitation is extended to all in
dependent voters, regardless of past
political affiliations.—Meigs Review.
HURRAH FOR TEXAS AND BRO.
BENTLEY!
Headquarters People’s Party State
Committee of Texas,
Abilene, Tex., Sept. 2, 1908.
To the Populists of Texas:
You are already advised that our
State Convention at Fort Worth,
August 11, nominated an electoral
ticket, and that it was made my duty
to secure for said ticket its proper
place on the official ballot. The fol
lowing copy of a letter received by
me today will explain itself:
Department of State, State of Texas,
Austin, August 31, 1908.
Mr. 11. L. Bentley, Abilene, Texas.
Dear Sir: Replying to yours of
the 29th inst., I beg to advise that
the certificate sent to this Depart
ment on the 24th inst. is all that is
required, and the names will appear
on the official ballot.
Yours very truly,
W. R. DAVIE,
Secretary of State.
This means that you will be able
to cast your ballots November 3 for
Hon. Thos. E. Watson of Georgia and
Judge Samuel W. Williams of In
diana, our nominees respectively for
President and Vice President of the
United States.
Yours very truly,
H. L. BENTLEY,
Ch’m. People’s Party State Com.
Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 4, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Sir: Ever since the
winding up of Mr. Bryan’s political
machine at Denver, I have been vron
dering whether the frenzied financier,
Lawson, intended his telegram as a
compliment or a sort of left-handed
giggle to, or at, Mr. Bryan.
I’d like your opinion through the
Jeffersonian, thereof.
Mr. Lawson’s telegram says: “I
wrote you a few days ago that I did
not believe you stood any chance of
being elected but”—here comes in
the compliment—“considering your
adroitness in capturing the opposition
by giving up your poppycockdoodle
ism of free silver and government
ownership, I believe there is a
chance for you,” etc., etc. Now
this was the first I had ever
heard of the advocacy of the free
coinage of silver and government
ownership of public utilities as being
poppycockdoodleism, ’ ’ and if it is so,
then it would seem to me that in
stead of Mr. Bryan’s capturing the
enemy, the boot is on the other leg,
as Mr. Bryan certainly has surren
dered the only big guns of poppy
cockdoodleism with which he has con
fronted the enemy since he abandoned
the more vital and effective advocacy
of a people’s money—greenbacks.
Truly for it,
C. T. PARKER'.
LARGE CROWD AT ROYSTON.
One of the largest crowds ever
seen in Royston was here Thursday
to hear Tom Watson.
Mayor Doyle, in a neat and’ ap
propriate speech, welcomed Mr. Wat
son and the visitors to the city.
Col. T. C. Dorough, in his charac
teristic style, introduced the speak
er. His speech was short but point
ed.
There is no use to dwell on Wat
son’s speech. He was the same Tom
Watson of old, full of vim and fire.
He talked as he talked eighteen years
ago, pleading with Populists to stay
by the principles they stood for when
the party was first organized. And
irom the amount of applause and en
thusiasm displayed by the audience
it seemed as if the “old guard” will
be with their leader at the finish.—
