THE HOUR OF SILENCE.
If e’er you see the shadow settle
down
Upon the face of one you love, for
bear
Just then to urge and prick and
jostle, spare
Awhile your love’s demand, “Away
that frown,
Come and amuse me now; and swift
ly crowm
My love with answering love, if
you forswear
Not all where I with you have any
share.
To me, to me now give what is mine
own! ”
O be more generous! Perchance your
scorns
Are given to one in mortal strug
gle, dumb
Because his strength is ebbing, wffiose
dark fate
Presses upon his brown the piercing
thorns.
Ask not, but stay as near as you
may come;
Enwreathe him with your love and
silent wait!
Martha Foote Crow, in Appleton’s
(May).
DECENTRALIZATION DESIRED.
The appointment of a Prussian
commission, made up of eminent
economists, captains of industry and
governors and mayors, charged with
the duty of reporting on methods of
decentralizing and simplifying meth
ods of administration in the king
dom, marks a turn in the tide. It
shows that greater efficiency in gov
ernment does not always go hand in
hand with concentration of author
ity and complexity of mechanism.
The bane of officialdom in Prussia,
as, indeed, throughout the Empire,
has been red tape. Evidently some
of it is to be cut. —Boston Herald.
POPE BROWN IN REPORT SHOWS
A HUGE DEFICIT.
The treasury of the State lacks be
tween $160,000 and $200,000 to
strike a balance.
This state of Georgia’s financial af
fairs became known today by the
transmission of a report on the treas
ury’s condition to Governor Joseph
M. Brown by Treasurer Pope Brown.
Some days ago, since assuming
charge of the State’s affairs as chief
executive, Governor Brown asked the
treasurer for a statement as to the
State’s financial condition.
The statement as compiled by
Treasurer Brown contains confirma
tion of the reports current for some
time that there was a minus quantity
of funds in the treasury.
The report states that the shortage
of funds amounts to not less than
$160,000 and may run up to $200,-
000. The statement indicates a de
ficit of the difference between $530,-
000 and $330,000, of which some

$40,000 may be used to reduce the
amount. This last item comes from
a source which the treasurer has not
determined as to its application.
There is not enough money in the
treasury to pay the expense of the
present Legislature. Just where it is
coming from remains for Treasurer
Brown and the other officials to work
out.
The statement of the State's crip
pled condition coming on the heels of
the oft repeated statement of leaders
of the late administration that the
treasury was in splendid shape, will
create considerable interest. —Macon
Telegraph.
DISPUTING THE RETURNS.
The stork recently visited the home
of a well-knwon politician who lives
in a town up the State, and in due
time the family physician, wearing a
reassuring smile, entered the library
where the anxious father was wait
ing.
“I congratulate you, sir,” gleefully
exclaimed the doctor; “you are fath
er of triplets.”
“What’s that?” excitedly cried the
politician, springing to his feet.
“I said that you are the father of
triplets,” repeated the physician.
“There is some mistake in the re
turns,” w r as the startling rejoinder of
the politician. “I demand a re
count.” —Philadelphia Telegraph.
BLACK EYE FOR DEEP WATER.
That was a curious report that the
board of engineers made to Congress
to the effect that a fourteen-foot
channel through the valley is “not
desirable.”
This supreme arrogance is as
tounding. The desirability of a four
teen-foot channel is not the concern
of the board of engineers. Their
only concern is the cost and the feasi
bility of such an undertaking. That
is what Congress wanted to know,
and that is what the people wanted
to know. Whether the channel is de
sirable or not is a matter which Con
gress and the people will decide for
themselves.
These wise men claim that an
eight-foot channel will carry all the
traffic seeking a water route. /May
be so, but what has the board of en
gineers to do with it? That is a
question for the people.
It has long been claimed that the
vast railroad interests are opposed
to any improvement in water trans
portation. These interests fought ap
propriations for levees until it was
made clear to them that the use of
the words “to improve navigation”
were used to get around the consti
tutional objections to appropriating
money for levees that merely guard-
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, July 8, 1909
ed riparian lands and had nothing to
do with the improvement of naviga
tion.
It was openly charged that the
transcontinental railroad interests
fought the canal project across the
isthmus for forty years, maintaining
a strong lobby at Washington during
each session of Congress. Senator
Morgan, of Alabama, during his life
time, fought and denounced this rail
road lobby ht every turn. The late
C. P. Huntington, in a public speech,
endeavored to show that a canal was
not necessary, and we know how the
railroad interests lured away every
capable engineer that the Govern
ment could employ to take charge of
the work.
It is an old story that the railroad
interests control the Government en
gineers, and, if true, this will account
for the report just rendered.
The cost of a fourteen-foot chan
nel is put at $128,000,000. For a
nation such as ours this is a mere
bagatelle when we reflect that the
Mississippi and Ohio drain, in whole
or in part, twenty-three other states,
and this includes the garden of the
country in productiveness.
The Canal du Midi of Southern
France, connecting the Mediterrane
an with the Atlantic ocean, was com
pleted in 1681 at a cost of $680,000,-
000 at the expense of one man, Paul
Piquet, who, no doubt, was secretly
assisted by the national government.
Its commerce is great, but its chief
city, Toulouse, on the Garonne, which
forms a part of the waterway, has
only 150,000 inhabitants, and the
territory which it serves commer
cially is not as large as West Tennes
see. If a canal costing $700,000,000
is worth while in Southern France
by Carcassonne, Limoges, Perpig
nan and other purely wine-raising
countries, surely a canal costing in
finitely less will prove prifltable for
numerous cities much more populous
and to a territory that is imperial in
its dimensions. Farmers’ New r s

SHALL THE NEGRO RUN OUR
TRAINS?
It is to. be hoped the fire
men in Georgia will finally win
in their fight. This question at
present, involves a great deal more
than what is shown on the face, and
sifted down to a fine point, the fate
of the nation is at stake. If the
number of negro firemen continue to
increase it is a matter of only a few
years till our freight trains will be
pulled by negro engineers, and when
they begin to run freight trains with
negro engineers, it stands to reason
that it will be only a short time be
fore negroes will be driving the en-
gines of passenger trains, which ulti
mately means negro conductors, and
as conductors on passenger trains,
we are told, have police powers, it
can easily be seen what we are drift
ing into.
We don’t intend to convey the idea
that the negro must not be allowed
to make an honest living by the
“sweat of his face,” but we do con
tend that white men should be given
preference in all lines of work, and
especially professional work and
skilled labor. We hope and believe
that we will see the day when the ne
gro will be eliminated from the rail
road, except as porters, etc. Not. only
are negroes given precedence on rail
roads as far as the authorities dare
go, but right here in our midst the
negro is given preference over white
men.
It is nothing unusual to walk down
Broad street in Columbus, where a
fine building is being erected, and see
every man on the building, including
the foreman, a negro, while plenty
of white men, good mechanics, are
begging for work. At the same time
the men who are having these build
ings erected are raving over negro ap
pointments to federal positions and
condemning the authorities who
make the appointments. Where is
the difference between a private citi
zen giving a fat job to a negro and
an officer of the Government giving
it to him? We think the difference
is in favor of the officer, especially
when the negro's vote helped to elect
him. and the private citizen is under
no obligation to the negro.
We fail to conceive of how a true
Southern white man can work ne
groes in good paying jobs when
white men are begging, and some
times go so far as to work white la
bor under a negro foreman. Yet it
is being done in every Southern city.
The negro is here and must be al
lowed to make his living, but the
sooner we learn to recognize that he
is our enemy, the better it will be for
us as a race of people who expect to
dominate this country to the end.
The negro is our enemy socially and
commercially, and he is our worst
enemy politically. In many instances
he actually elects the President of
the United States. It is the negro
vote in many of the doubtful States
and in some of the sure Republican
States that keep that party in pow
er.—Phenix-Girard Journal.
