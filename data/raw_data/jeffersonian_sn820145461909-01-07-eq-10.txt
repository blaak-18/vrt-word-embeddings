Sketches from Roman History
The warfare that is being carried on
today against class legislation has
aroused a keen interest in this little
book, in which Mr. Watson deals with
the heroic land reformers of Rome,
the great slave revolt, the tribune of
the people, the brilliant leader of the
aristocrats, and other dramatic scenes
in the history of Rome.

ran but little risk, because of my
knowledge of men and things—a pre
requisite not possessed by every man
handling other people’s money.” A
frank admission this.
“ ‘Merritt Miller.’ ”
Reid’s face was as white as a sheer,
his hands shook as if palsied and his
voice trembled as he hissed:
“The viper!”
“But after this admission, do you
not feel that you owe something to
the bank in its present condition?”
asked the lawyer, persuasively.
“In the law I do not owe a dol
lar to the bank, but there is $35,000
worth of paper that is not properly
secured, and as I may'be morally re
sponsible for that amount, I volun
tarily surrender this batch of United
States bonds, which will more than
over-balance any loss to the bank
caused by my carelessness,” replied
Reid, now thoroughly frightened, but
putting up a bold front.
The lawyer licked his lips and
reached forward and received the
bonds, remarking as he did so, to the
officer:

the balance of the day out of respect
to deceased members which have died

House adjourned 323 bills were in
troduced. Not many of them, though,
will ever become laws. The members
were only fulfilling pledges to their
constituents that they would intro
duce the bills. Next year they will
be back here telling the people that
Uncle Joe would not let them pass
