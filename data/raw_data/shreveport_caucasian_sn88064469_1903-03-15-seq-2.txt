plicity and modesty--for he did not
once refer to the Merrimac incident
and impressive by reason of his per
sonality rather than by any oratorical
effects or gestures, and he held the
attention of the audience throughout
his address.
His subject was "America as a
World Power." Judge Philip Lindsley
introduced the speaker in a brief talk.
and Captain Hobson began his address.
He dwelt upon the great commercial
growth of the United States, and opti
mistically prophesied that it would
soon be the leader along this line, as
well as nU'merically, physically and in
tellectually the superior of all other
nations, and that for this reason it
became her natural and logical duty to
assume a foremost place in the adjust
ment of external complications where
the stronger endeavors to prey on the
weaker.
He advocated an extension of the
Monroe doctrine that would include
the unenlightened Asiatic countries
and bring them all under the strong
protecting arm of the one country that
advocates the true atruistic principles
of living.
An, amusing incident occurred just
as. Captain Hobson begana his address
Re had said but a word or two when
some one ir the audience sang out..
"-Gb it. Hobson!" and he responded im
