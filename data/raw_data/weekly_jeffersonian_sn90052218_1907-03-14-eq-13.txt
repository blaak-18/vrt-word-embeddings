THE MAN WHO WINS.
(Baltimore News.)
The man who wins is the man who
works —
The man who toils while the next man
shirks;
The man who stands in his deep dis
tress
With his head held high in the deadly
press—
Yes, he is the man who wins.
The man who wins is the man who
knows
The value of pain and the worth of
woes—
Who a lesson learns from the man
who falls
And a moral finds in his mournful
wails:
Yes, he is the man who wins.
The man who wins is the man who
stays
In the unsought paths and the rocky
ways,
And, perhaps, who lingers now and
then,
To help some failure to rise again,
And, he is the man who wins!
And the man who wins is the man
who hears
The curse of the envious in his ears,
But who goes his way with his head
held high
And passes the wrecks of the failures
by—
For he is the man who wins.

TO THE BOYS OF AMERICA.
Os course what we have a right to
expect from the American boy is that
he shall turn out to. be a good Ameri*
can man.
Now the chances are strong that he
won’t be much of a man unless he is
a good deal of a boy. He must not be
a coward or a weakling, a bully, a
shirk or a prig. He must work hard
and play hard. He must be clean
minded and clean-lived, and able to
hold his own under all circumstances
and against all comers. It is only on
these conditions that he will grow
into the kind of a man of whom Amer
ica can really be proud. In life, as in
a football game, the principle to fol
low is: Hit the line hard; don’t foul
and don’t shirk, but hit the line hard.
—Theodore Roosevelt.
CLOTHES.
To be a leader of fashion one must
be a follower. The man who pays the
compliment is not always the man
who pays for the gown.
“United we stand, but divided we
get all sorts of mean things said about
us,” saith The Skirt.
The most adorned woman is not al
ways the most adored.
As a man’s salary gets higher his
wife’s gowns get lower.
A widow and her weeds are soon
parted.
An old fashion is old, but an ancient
fashion is always modern.—Walter
Pulitzer, in March Delineator.

street strumpets loathed by woman
kind. In speaking of her coming de
but, Miss Hemenway said: “How I
do hate it! /1 guess I will have to sub
mit, however, and I might as well get
it over with!” The poor girl seems
to have a pretty fair idea of what
“high” Washington society means.
