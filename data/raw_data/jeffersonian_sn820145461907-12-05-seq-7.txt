would otherwise enrich the manure
heap.
Without going further, then, into
details, this one fact stands out
above everything else in the new
farm science— a “food tonic’’ is a
necessity.
Eminent medical writers, such a*
Profs. Winslow, Quitman and Finley
Dun, tell us certain elements are al
ways beneficial—bitter tonics, which
aid and strengthen digestion, iron
well known as a blood builder, and ni
trates, which act as cleansing agent*
to remove poisonous matter from the
animal system. These are the ingre
dients found in th* tonic which pro
duce healthy growth. Production and
condition are sure to follow in cattle,
horses, sheep or swine when these ele
ments are given.—Texas Farmer.
LABOR NECESSARY.
Do not think that the farmer is the
only person in this world who has to
work. In fact, the farmer with his
riding plow, riding cultivator, riding
harrow, and other improved imple
ments has about as easy time as the
man who sits behind the bank coun
ter and wrestles with the proposition
how to avert a run on his bank, or
the merchant who lies awake nights
and worries how he will meet his bills
when the banks refuse to pay his
checks.
Everybody has to work, either with
his hands or his head. We can never
accomplish anything unless we work
for it. “In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread,’’ is the judg
ment pronounced by a never erring
God upon all mankind. We must la
bor with a labor that produces sweat
before we can partake of the fruits
of our ambitions; and, generally, the
more we sweat the surer our chances
of success are. No great thing has
been done, so great success has bee*
leached, no victory has been won
without hard labor, the labor that
produces sweat on the face. Even
the salvation of this world was not
accomplished till the Lowly Man had
sweat his life’s blood. There are no
flowery beds of ease for any man.
We all must fight to win the prize—
we all must sail through bloody seas.
Mr. Toil confronts us on every hand
and we must embrace him, make a
friend of him, love him before he will
permit us to pass on to success.
The man who shirks never rises,
never succeeds in the battle of life.
All the world hates the shirker, the
man who is looking for a soft snap.
His reputation will make it impos
sible for him to win, if nothing else
hinders. The man who willingly
works hard enough to earn a dollar
generally succeeds in getting the dol
lar. The man who is getting two dol
lars, but works only hard enough to
cam one, will soon be receiving only
the one dollar.
Labor confronts the young man on
every hand, in the country, in the
town and in the city. Do not lead
the boys and girls to think that the
city is filled with soft snaps and that
all they have to do to escape work is
to escape the farm. Show them that
labor meets them at every turn of
the road, and that if they do decide
to go to the city, they must make up
their minds to work and work hard
to succeed, even there. When the
young are taught that it is impossible
to escape hard work, a mighty step is
taken in the direction of preventing
failure in their lives.—Farmers’ Ad
vocate.
RESOLUTIONS OF MONROE
COUNTY FARMERS’
UNION.
Forsyth, Ga., Nov. 9, 1907.
Whereas, All cotton goods are con
trolled by the trusts of the country;
and.
Whereas, Said trusts are made pos
sible in a large degree by the tariff
on cotton goods. Therefore be it
Resolved by the Farmers Union of
Monroe County, That we ask our rep
resentative in congress, the Hon. C.
L. Bartlett, to us his influence to get
all manufactured cotton goods placed
on the free list.
0. W. HOLLAND, Secy.
OUR COTTON LETTERS.
No doubt about it, that the recent
panic was made to order, on Wall
street for the purpose of bearing
down the price of cotton. If this is
not true, please tell just why this
thing did not come off until just at
the right time to force the weak cot
ton on the markets at ruinous prices?
Henrv Grady said that cotton was
a fool; but we are of the opinion that
men that put too much faith in cotton
are the fools who are now passing
through perhaps the toughest trials
of their experiences with more cotton
than they are able to hold easily.
Several men are selling corn, pork,
wheat and oats to pay their debts
with in the Carolinas and Georgia,
and holding on to their cotton like
“grim death to a dead nigger.’’
Boys, keep cool and don’t waver;
for it is said that the darkest hour*
of the night are just before day. The
water is deep and may get up to your
nose, but hold your breath and wade
on clear over, for the water and way
are clear and the bottom is firm.
Beyond a doubt
Beyond doubt there is an attempt
among some of the officials of the
Union to suppress some information
of vital interest to the welfare of the
Union from its members. This we
condemn as an unfair act for the
members, the Union should hear both
sides of all questions or they will not
be in position to do justice to all and
thus defend the equitable principles
of the Union.
All such attempts to suppress in
formation from the membership of
the Union, and going out on a still
hunt for personal interest and ag
grandizement, will react against
such individuals when the light is
turned on to them.
We are in possession of the evi
dence to establish every allegation set
forth in this communication and will
turn it into the Union at the proper
time and place.
A WARNING.
The attention of our Farmers’ Un
ion Bureau of Information has been
called to the fact that a notice has
appeared in several newspapers of
the State calling a meeting of the
State Union to be held in Colum
bia on December 18.
As the above notice has no name
or authority attached to it, tha origt*
WATSON’S WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
of this call was rather puzzling until
it leaked out that just one man had
promoted the call and the worst fea
ture of this affair is that the man
who claims the responsibility for this
call is a sranger in the state, whose
conduct since he has got in the union,
and his affiliations and his work be
fore are among that very class of
speculative or slick duck class that
the union was organized to put out of
business.
Now this bureau has taken the po
sition from the beginning of this dis
turbance among its officials, that
nothing short of a regularly called
delegated meeting of the State Union
in full accord with the constitution
would ever settle this question satis
factorily.
But, we protest against following
the lead of any such a self-inaugu
rated stray bellwether, who has pre
sumed to make this call, and insist
and demand that this call be made
through the officials in regular order,
in accordance with the constitution.
If it is constitutional for one man
to get up a conspiracy among a few
designing men to unhorse the whole
official head of the Union, then it is
high time to cut that feature of the
constitution out. or we will be sub
ject to an eternal guerrilla warfare
in the Union, and when we meet in
Columbia again for the purpose of re
storing peace, good order and har
mony within the Union some defeat
ed aspirant for position may go right
hack home and repeat the same dis
turbance that we are now trying to
calm.
Brethren, we need all our com
bined and united strength to fight
our enemies, and never fail to pin
your faith to leaders from among
your ranks, who are well known,
faithful, competent men for each and
every position of trust. —Seneca Jour
nal.
RETIRING ON THE FARMS.
The Ellensburg Localizer publishes
an interesting story illustrating the
possibilities of agriculture in that
fertile valley of Kittitas. It tells of
many farmers who have installed in
dividual lighting plants in their
homes. They have cast away the old
methods of carrying about lamps and
lanterns, and introduced the modern
acetylene works. In every instance
the plants represent numerous lights
for the homes, barns and outbuild
ings. Tn this respect the farmers
have brought the city conveniences to
their homes, and actuallv retired to
easier lives on their own farms. Their
children are more contented, and
peace and family prosperity reign
on the old homestead.
A new era has dawned on the ag
ricultural districts of onr countrv. It
brings sunshine instead of shadows.
It removes the old-time drudgerv and
establishes the farm ns a business
proposition. The rural mails keen
the farmer in touch with the citv and
countrv. through the daily papers.
The public telephone lines reach into
almost everv cultivated district and
connect the home with the town. The
element of loneliness has been re
moved. The sons and daughters of
the farm have discovered that it is
better to live an independent life on
' th* d**ded farm than Buffer a butter-
fly existence in the rented slate of
the city. They have found the real
romance of living in the open world
surrounded by the works of nature.
Retiring from the farm marks an
age of more than ordinary importance
to the man who has developed a
homestead. It signifies the closing of
an eventful career in search of soma
thing upon which to exist in his de
clining years. It is the place for the
erection of a monument to success.
But to arrive at a point in life when
the farmer may retire upon his own
farm and receive the benefits of city
life is something new in the work of
agricultural advancement. That can
be done by building on a aure foun
dation. The farmers of Kittitas
county have planted their acres to al
falfa and timothy. Those crops pro
duce annual incomes, from the hay v
marketed. Such income* are suffi
cient to enable the owner* of good
tract* to retire and enjoy the fruit*
of their labor*. The lesson is to get
hay farm* and hold the muntil they
become permanent income payers.—
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
THE DUTY OF GOOD CITIZENS.
Home and its protection is th*
safeguard of all government.
That citizen who has the love of
home and fealty to home interests
is a worthy representative of a com
monwealth. It is the mass of such
men that are the backbone of any
community, and, figuratively, the
mainstay and the rock upon which
the nations are founded. He, who
lives in a community and fails to
support the public institutions and
does not assist in the upbuilding of
industries, that add to the great
ness of that community, is like an
alien. While he lives in one place
hi* heart is in another. He is not
the ideal citizen, for he is not in har
mony with those w r ho are his neigh
bors. It is the duty of every resident
of a town or community to do his ut
most to advance its interest. By do
ing this he not alone assists him
self, but his neighbor, his town, his
country, his state and nation. —Pal-
mer Rustler.
THE CALL OF THE FARM.
Perhaps one of the best and wisest
philanthropies that could be under
taken would be the institution of an
intelligent and systematic campaign
for stemming the human tide that is
flowing in so large numbers from the
farms to the cities, leaving the farms
behind to go to waste and crowding
still more human atoms into already
congested centers of population where
the struggle for existence is sharp
and the rewards of mediocrity limit
ted. It seems strange, when one looks
about him at the pursuits of the city
dw’eller of the poorer and middle
class and the scant returns he man
ages to wring from his pursuit, that
it should be ever necessary to per
suade him to a course so obviously to
his advantage as would be removal to
the soil. And nowhere on earth are
the opportunities of the farmer great
er than right here in the South, right
now. It is interesting in this connec
tion to note what was recently said
on this subject by A. D. Shamel, a
com expert in the employ of the gov
ernment agricultural department and
the owner of a large farm in lowa.
