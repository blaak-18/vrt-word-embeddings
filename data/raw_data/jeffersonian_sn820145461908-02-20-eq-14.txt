PAGE FOURTEEN
THE NEGROES AND THE SOUTH.
(Continued from Page Two.)
When the truth is told, the negro has no
such a friend in the wide expanse from the
Atlantic to the Pacific as the white people
of the South, who understand the foibles of
the race far better than any one else, and
who has taken an interest in his welfare.
Thrown into a cold and strange country, where
individual achievement is all that interests,
the negro is shown no consideration. His in
firmities are not countenanced and his short
comings are not overlooked.
There is no country that suits the negro
as well as these Southern states. Nowhere)
else is he understood so well as here. Take
the country negro, who has spent his life on
the farm, and let him be transplanted to an
other section, and he will not only be seized
with the homesickness which is an incident to
such changes with all people of every color
and condition, but the affliction will be of
such a violent nature that he will not long
survive it.
Thousands of American negroes were lured
to Liberia years ago. They had this experi
ence. A few only were able to make their
return back to the South, and the rest in the
country of their fathers have not prospered.
Today they are believed to be less in number
and certainly in the majority of cases in a
worse condition than they were when they
went.
The negroes of the South may be scat
tered over the rest of the country by the
slow moving causes of generations, but that
such a distribution or change of location can
be accomplished in a short time by a whole
sale exodus from the South and colonization
in other states, is an irridescent dream. —Au-
