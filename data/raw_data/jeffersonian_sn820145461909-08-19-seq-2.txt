What Our Farmers Are Saying and Doing
Build Cotton Factories in
the iSOUth J.CDrvine
HAVE tried to show that it
is tlje policy of other na
tions to retain their own
natural products, also to get
[I)
control of any products from other
lands in which there might be any
profit, to manufacture these at home
and sell the products abroad. The
profit resulting from manufacture is
from two to ten times greater than
that from selling raw material; and
a well managed system of trade in
creases this still more.
I also tried to show that the manu
facturing section of the United States
has retrograded in foreign trade and
lost much custom in this line that it
®nce controlled. Holland and Ger
many are spreading out in Mexico
and South America, Japan is filching
the trade of the Chinese and Pacific
Islands. Having lost these advan
tages, the manufacturers and large
dealers have used their efforts to
make up the loss by exploiting the
agricultural sections of this country.
Goods manufactured in some other
lands are more durable in quality
and of finer finish than most of those
produced by the mills of the North.
But the advantage of getting goods
of foreign make is much curtailed
by an almost prohibitive tariff. The
ingenuity of the Northern manufac
turer is exercised in putting up in
ferior imitations which, with a
smooth outside finish, are almost
practically worthless. Having no
lasting qualities, they must often be
replaced. This creates an excessive
demand and leads to such extortion
ate prices that the purchasing power
of the consumer is often exhausted
before his full wants are supplied.
There are but few families in the
South but what could use, without
any waste, from five to one hundred
dollars worth more of cotton goods
than they can well afford to buy.
Another incentive to high prices is
that in order to sell any of their out
put in foreign markets, the manufac
turers of this country have to sell at
lower prices abroad, and to cover this
loss they add it to the prices charged
in home markets.
A spirit of avarice, joined to a sort
of sectional dislike toward all hu
manity south of Mason and Dixon’s
line, renders them somewhat un
scrupulous in their dealings with the
Southron.
The farmers of the South are in a
position somewhat “between the
devil and the deep sea.’’
There was a time when the South
had good reason to feel that her
rights as individual States were not
properly regarded. Her statesmen
protested. Their protests were
treated with contempt. The States
withdrew from the Union. Armies
were sent down to force them back.
Her sons arose to resist the invasion
and protect their homes. They were
outnumbered and overpowered. They
gave up the fight and returned to
their homes in a financially weak
condition. The money sharks, know
ing the importance of cotton and its
possibilities in the way of profit, ad
vanced the planters money and in
augurated a credit and mortgage
system that has kept the Southern
farmers in a worse state of bondage
than that occupiel by the negro slaves
before freedom. For forty years the
South has been producing cotton and
selling it at, or a little over, cost to
supply the factories of the world.
Today the South has a more ur
gent call than that of “States’ rights.’’
It is a call to change the prevailing
cotton methods and retain some of
its profits at home. It is a call upon
the farmers to free themselves from
the grip of the speculator and the
still more dangerous manufacturer,
and to release theii* wives from field
drudgery and give their children a
chance to cultivate their God-given
intellects.
Many remedies, by many physi
cians, have been prescribed for what
they term “unfavorable Southern
conditions.” Some politicians, edi
tors and speculators say there is
nothing the matter with the South
execept over-prosperity. I reckon some
of the farmers feel lots of the pros
perity jingling in their pockets. Many
of the remedies are purely of a seda
tive character and don’t strike at the
seat of the evil. Some on the re
trenchment and restrictive diet or
der would do very well if ALL who
raise cfiotton would follow them up.
But when about three-tenths follow
this and seven-tenths adopt some
thing different, but little in the way
of betterment has so far resulted.
I can not but think that so long as
the South follows a strictly agricul
tural system, without attempting to
hold some of the profits that would
arise from manufacturing some of
the products here at home, that the
Southern planters will remain in the
same treadmill, mark-time condition
and never get much ahead.
A short time ago I read where a
Southern writer, criticising some sug
gestions that had been made for en
larging the scope of Southern enter
prize, made remark to the effect that
the South should not try to “gobble
up the whole world,” —“give North
erners, foreigners and Japanese some
chance.” The South has been so
busy gobbling up the world for the
last forty years that she hasn’t room
to. gobble any more.
Charity is chief of the graces, but
if you expel her from your own home,
fireside and loved ones and send her
to shower all her blessings abroad,
it is a case of mistaken identity.
C onservatism is a virtue, but it may
be indulged in to the point of such
“masterly inactivity” that the desired
point may never be gained where
much opposition of a certain kind is
to be encountered.
Just so long as the Southern farm-
3effersotiian
ers, as a whole oi' in part, do not fix
their sights higher than to raise cot
ton and sell it to Northern, Euro
pean and Japanese factories their
shot will fall short of the mark in
getting a decent, respectable price
for it.
Those who are in the movement
to cut acreage and hold crop off the
market have wisdom on their side,
provided they stood in front of
enough of the 13,000,000 bales, but
behind them, I am sorry to say,
stands too small a part of the output.
For every acre they cut short, the
other man will plant two; for every
bale held back, two will get into the
hands of the men that are lying in
wait for it. It any one does not think
that some of the outsiders did not
plant larger acreage, how will you
account for the large crop of 1908?
Take a retrospect. Floods out West
submerged large areas of cotton in
Texas and Arkansas, the Augusta
freshet did the same in Georgia and
Carolina, the boll weevil was destruc
tive out West, very unfayorable sea
sons prevailed through this section
of Georgia, the Farmers’ Union had
largely cut down acreage, and some
of them plowed up a part of what
they had planted. All these things
pointed to a short crop. I see in
some last summers newspapers where
it was prohesied that the crop would
fall short of 10,000,000 bales. But
it didn’t. With all these unfavor
able conditions against it, somebody
must have helped it out.
There is the cotton of too many
large land-owners and of too many
negroes to compete with.
Cotton factors and manufacturers
like to come in conference with the
representative farmer. They will
talk to him with the tongues of an
gels, while they are mentally sizing
him up and calculating how much
cheap cotton they can get out of him.
No one need expect any conces
sions from manufacturers—especially
those of New England and those
who have capital invested in South
ern factories unless they are forced
out of them. They are a match for
anything, from the government and
the railroads down to their own oper
atives and the men from whom they
buy raw material. “For ways that
are dark and for tricks that are
vain” they are peculiar. They are
ready to convert into dollars and
cents the lives of men, women and
children —especially the women and
children. Their self-operating ma
chinery can be managed by children,
and as they do not cost much they
prefer them. Nor do they spare Old
Father Time himself. With build
ings lighted by electricity they run
on a twenty-four-hour schedule. One
gang of “the slaves of bell and whis
tle’’ works until six in the evening.
At bell tap they go home and the
night relay takes their place until
six in the morning.
A manufacturer would consider
that he was incapacitated for busi
ness if he were to grant any raise
in wages to operatives or in prices
paid for cheap cotton.
Os course, manufacturers do not
in every way have an easy job. They
have high freight to pay, and other
disadvantages to encounter. To the
New England States coal has to be
hauled from Pennsylvania. Nor is
the soil of those States suitable for
making brick, which adds to the ex
pense. The cost of food makes the
cost of labor high. Switzerland, as
I have showed, has no natural fa
cilities for manufacture or trade.
Japan has to haul cotton from this
section by rail to the Pacific, thence
by steamer across the ocean. A short
time ago Japan had to have one mil
lion bales of cotton hauled in one lot
by Hill’s railroads from Mobile to
Seattle, then over the sea to Yoko
hama. The train of cars was said
to be IGS miles long. (If the South
ern farmers had a little of the get-up
about them that those Japanese mon
keys have, we would have a different
condition of things in this country.)
This cotton probably cost Japan
about $75,000,000. When manufac
tured and sold it would clear about
$350,000,000.
There are many reasons why it
would be to the interest of the South
if factories were built here and oper
ated strictly with Southern capital.
First. The cotton has to travel too
far and pass through too many hands
before the producer gets a chance to
wear any of it. He first sells it to
the buyer at no profit to himself.
The buyer ships to the factor. The
railroad and the buyer make profits.
The factor ships to the manufacturer.
The steamei’ or railroad and the fac
tor make profits. The manufacturer
ships goods to the wholesaler. The
railroad and manufacturer make
profits. The wholesaler ships to the
retailer. The railroads, the whole
saler and retailer make profits. And
if the goods comes “from foreign
parts. Uncle Sam makes a tariff
profit. Seven oi' eght of these profits
could be saved if the goods were
made in the South with Southern
capital and that much added to her
income.
Second. The tariff makes goods
from foreign countries high. We
have not only to pay the foreigner’s
price, but have to pay just as much
to Uncle Sam for tariff. Uncle Sam
makes neither cotton nor cotton
goods, but makes you pay extra for
your clothes. But then, Uncle Sam
has a government that costs him
over a billion dollars each year to
run it. If the producers and con
sumers don’t pay it, who will? The
banks, trusts and railroads should
not be asked to make it up.
Third. On goods made in the Uni
ted States the tariff allows the mak
ers of the goods to charge more for
their shoddy goods than foreigners
and Uncle Sam both together charge
for foreign made wear.
Byway of parenthesis, I will state
that the negroes in the Niger country
in Africa “produce annually 50,000
bales of cotton —average weight 400
pounds. Nine-tenths of this is made
into cloth at home for home cloth
ing.”
