LAST OF THE rHUGUENOTS.
Few Traces of the Community In
the East End of London.
When Princess Charlotte entered
London for her marri:age with King
George and the coronation revels which
followed it, she passed from White
chapel to Islington through a prosper
ous French section known as Spital
fields. It was the settlement of the
Huguenot refugees, who carried their
industries as well as their religicdn from
France and planted mulberry trees in
large gardens where silkworms could
be fed on home grown leaves.
The descendants of these weavers
were rich and prosperous in the days
of George III., and they lived in fine
old houses, with oak paneled rooms
and high latticed windows close under
the eaves, where they could have light
for working their looms. There were
as many as a dozen Huguenot churches
in the east end of Iondon during the
Georgian reigns, and when the beauti
ful Spitalfields church was built, with
its lofty spire, its bell early3 after sun
rise and again at curfew was the sig
nal for thousands of industrious weav
ers to begin or end their labors for the
day. The industry has disappeared.
the houses have fallen into decay and
the gardens are neglected. Spitalfields
has lost its French aspect and been
converted into a swarming ghetto.
In order to find a distinct trace of the
Huguenot community, which had so
hororable a history in the east end, one
must now go farther out in Hackney
and visit the French Protestant hos
pital near Victoria park. It is a beau
tiful modern structure designed tin imi
tation of an old time French chateau,
and it stands in spacious, well kept
grounds which offer a marked contrast
to the ordinary east end environment.
The institution owes its origin to a be
quest made by a French -Huguenot
refugee two centuries ago and to lib
eral contributions from weavers and
mergiants in Lomidbn. Work was be
gun hear Peetless Pool. in the northern
suburbs, where a hospital for poor
reach Protestants and their descend
ts was- opened andwwats long knoiwn

A MEAT ITEM.
Hamn V1ey Useful In Cold Weather.'
"Pan Broils" and Other Wrinkles.
Through' the cold weather the house
hold financier will find her meat bill
considerably lower if she keeps part of
a ham on hand.
For a small family the larger end of
a medium sized hatm is better than an
entire ham. At the time of purchasing
have the butcher cut several slices
from your purchase. These may be
rubbed with lard or suet fat and will
keep in primne condition for a week at
least. The grease is easily wiped off
when frying time comes.
Ham may be broiled, but for most
families it is best to "pan broil" it, for
in this way the fat is kept for frying
purposes. Pan cooked ham should be
cooked slowly, drawing the pan back
from the fire aftei the first few mo
ments. Always freshen the first slice
cooked, and then use judgment. Some
ham is fresh, enough for immediate
use. It is unnecessary when having
boiled ham and vegetables for dinner
or baked ham for the principal meat
dish to boil the entire amount of ham.
Espeeially is this undesirable in small
families, where one soon tires of a dish
often repleated. Cut off four or five
pounds of the ham in a compact chunk
and boil or bake it, leaving the rest to
be used lateron in the same or a differ
ent way. One should remember that
the ham will keep if the sliced side is
rubbed with lard or cornmeal almost
indefinitely during the cold weather.
Do not use it so frequently that the
members of your family tire of the
name ham. Remember it is only to sup
plement and eke out the purchase of
other meat, more especially for break
fasts and luncheons.
It the ham has not been skinned,
poufr boiling water over it and when it
is cool enough to handle scrape and
wash clean. If the ham is a large
whole one, it will require a wash boiler
in which to boil. For the small piecd of
ham mentioned above use an agate ket

The Erratic
and Fickle
Mis so ur i
[Special Correspondence.)
Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 27.- The
Missouri river has performed many
strange and erratic feats, but the
recent abandonment of Nebraska City,
Neb., in a single night must be
regarded as its star performance.
Between sand v.u and sunrise this
mot remarkable of rivers left its
bed in front of Nebraska City and
found another for itself two miles
distant. When the good people of the
town arose in the morning, they were
appalled to find that the river that had
been running past their doors for a
score of years had suddenly taken its
departure, leaving only the bed of dark
gray sand and silt where twelve hours
before had coursed the turgid waters of
the "Big Muddy."
Nebraska City, which is about fifty
miles above this city, stands, or rather,
stood, on an arm or a bend of the
DIAoaaG saM wlsW now THE MISSOURT
RIVER ABANDONED EBRaaSKa CITY.
Missouri, which is a stream of innu
merable bends and turns. Twenty-five
years ago the river was comparatively
straight in front of the site of Nebras
ka City, but it. sluddenly swerved in
agatinst the Nebraska bank and estab
lished there a channel fully two miles
from the bed in which it had been
wont to flow. It looked like a perma
nent change. The founders of Ne
braska City were without doubt of its
permanency. The city was built, and
the river was made the source of water
supply.
Of course all this is bad for Nebraska
City, involving some serious losses and
much inconvenience and giving rise to
perplexing questions affeeting riparian
rights and real estate titles. However,
to an enterprising and progessive town
like Nebraska City the damage os not
irreparable. The troublesome thing is
the uneertainty about the future con
duet of the river. N6body knovriwhen
the ni. Muoddy" wil- go on another
ramt agea ad change its course again.
What the-alissouri has done to Ne
braska City it may possibly at any
time of flood do to other cities or towns
along its banks. So at least say the
engineers who are reasonably familiar
with the strange and unaccountable do
ings of the great river. There are per
haps some few points where local
work has been done with such thor
oughnaess that there is no immediate
tdanger of the river breaking it down,
but along the greater n .ortolen of the
rivers heach there is- ia-ntd to stay
ine ae of the grea t rier tahes a no
tione toquit the~ town. It night leave
9at.oseph in the same way, and posl
bly Kansas Ctty,b though this city is
better secured than any other place on
the Missouri.
The banks of the Misrouri are a sown
alluvam, into whiP the water cuts
rapidly. They are Isofter banks than
,those of the Missisesippi, and the power
oif the Missouri is greater. It exerts
against its banks an average of some
50,000 horsepower, )vhich is enough to
do very destructive work.
An excess of energy in the Missouri
means the creation of a new channel
that is, itf there Is placed any obstruc
tion In the stream the water mounts
higher and exerts. an increased pres
sure. The result is that the Missouri
works around behind dikes and dpll
sorts of shore protections and tumbles
them down or covers them over.
The Missouri carries in its water a
great quantity of sand and silt. It de
posits this orearries it away according
to conditions, and it ean change its
course in a night because it can flu one
'channel with silt and cut anot "r in
the soft allvium without any trouble
at al .
It must be understood also that the
Missouri is some two and one-half
tiaes as long as the valley it traverses,
and probably has more bends and
crooks and less straight stretches than
any other big river on earth, which
adds to the diffculty of retaining the
-water within its channel at times of
fiood. -
What to do with the Missouri river
has been a pfoilem ever since it was
discovered. It remains a: great prob
lem today. The United States govern
ment has spent something more than
-$7,000,000 upon it and has finally aban
'doned the effort to make it a tractable
stream.
I.n the early days the Missouri was
the great highway between the Missis
sippivvalley and the gEFrt northwest.
When the railroads ',egan to crawl
oIt, on the plains the steamboating
bisiness on the Missburi began to- fall
off. But it did not entirely perish un
til, within the last ten years. During

WITH THE AUTHORS.
Humorist Bangs' New Editorial Job.
How Elinor Glyn Writes.
[Special Correspondence.]
New York. Jail. 2t;.-The Harpers re
cently purchased the Metropolitan
Magazine. a periodical whose chief
specialty was the printing of half 1ime
pic·tures of chorus girls in tights. It
is announced that Colonel Gte,,rge lar
vey. who is the directing spirit of the
reorganized Franklin sqluare house.
does not int-nd to continue the present
character of the publication. IHe
means to ml;ke it a magazine for New
Yorkers, and he has installed as editor
John Kendrick Bangs.
It will be interesting to learn which
of Mr. Bangs' literary activities will
be the more drawn upon in editing the
publication- his term as editor' of Ilar
per's \Weekly or his more prolonged
and doubtless con amnore chronicles of
the world of idiocy. There are not ia
few, however, who think Mr. Ban;, s
can he trusted with the leading strings
-or is it the whip?--of a serious and
wide awake magazine, into which no
doubt the Metropolitan will evolve.
Elinor Glyn. whose newweook. "T''l
Reflections of Ambrosine," has stirred
up a tempest in a teapot, has ben
questioned regarding her literary metii
ods. She said she hadn't any. 'Shave
never met any literary people," ladded
the young lady. "and do not belong to
any 'societies.' so I have not a notion of
the manner in whicih real authors write
books. I only wrote 'The Visits of
Elizabeth' to amuse myself, without
any idea of publishing it. S was ill
with rheumatism and felt sad. not he
ing able to walk. so wrote to divert
myself, taking my ideas from old jour
nals of mine that my mother had kept,
which I used to write for her when vis
iting about when I was a girl."
While returning to his home in Grand
Rapids. Mich., recently Stewart Ed
ward White, the author, fell into con
vervation with an elderly man in the
smoking room of the parlor car. The
man, as he afterward found out, is onle
of the most prominent lawyers in Ohio.
The talk turned upon the timber inter
ests of the north. and several other
men took part. Mr. White has lived
half his life in lumber camps and
showed a familiarity with the subject
that greatly interested the Ohio law
yer, who presently turned to him and
said:
"Young man, do you know of a book
called 'The Blazed Trail?'"
"Yes; I know of it," said White. "In
fact"- ,
"If you haven't read that story,"
broke in the man, "you ought Jo get
out at the next station and get it. I've
"DO YOU KNOW OF A BOOK CALLED 'THE
. BLAZED TiAIL?"'
recommended it to every man of my
acquaintance, particularly the young
men. But you particularly ought to
read it, for you're interested in lumber.
I suppose you're in the business, and
as 4a picture of forest and lumber
,camp life It's wonderful. I tell you,
young man"
"Excuse me," interrupted White in
some confusion, "but the fact is I
wrote 'The Blazed Trail.' "
The older man looked at him hard.
and then his eyes twinkled.
"I'll send you a bill later for the
work I've done in booming it." he said.
The many friends of Mrs. Wlggs of
the Cabbage Patch will be glad to meet
her again in the story of Lovey Mary,
now rmuiing in the Century. She ap
pears there as philosophical and good
humored as ever. Here are some of her
new sayings:
"She took on mighty few' airs for a
person in mournin'."
"Ma always used to say don't fool
with widowers, grass nor sod."
The ,early life of Charles Wagner,
whose "Simple Life" has been so high
ly praised. was spent among the Vosges
mountains. His natural inclinations
kept him out of doors the greater part
of the time, and so the worship of na
ture became a religion with him. a re
ligion-for which he is always seeking
proselytes.
It is told of him that once when he
I was passiplg a holiday on an island
near the French coast some young peo
ple who had been married by the may
or of a place in the north wrote to him
to ask him to bless their marriage.

purpose, and when they arrived Mr.
