POULTRY RAISING FOR PROFIT.
If you have healthy fowls, you
must not feed them in filthy vessels,
and must see that they have an abun
dance of pure, fresh water. Scald
out all vessels frequently and spread
lime on the floor and grounds used
by the birds.
Poultry raising as a side line is a
safe occupation, and can be made
both profitable and pleasant. As an
exclusive occupation it is a different
matter, and should be entered into
only after careful consideration. —
The Rural Californian.
DOTS FOR THE POULTRY RAISER.
At night is the best time to dust
the mother hen and chicks with lice
powder. Work the powder well into
the hen’s feathers.
Turkey hens will usually prove
profitable until the fifth year. It is
best, however, to change the males
annually. Don’t keep them over two
years at most.
Just as much feed and care is re
quired to raise mongrels as for pure
breds. The purebreds certainly pre
sent a much more attractive appear
ance.
Pullets which are early hatched
should not be subjected to any forc
ing process during the summer
months. Their frames should be
kept growing as long as possible.
A “hospital” in which to isolate
sick fowls, is a good thing to have.
Many of the poultry diseases are
spead by allowing the ailing birds to
eat and drink with the well ones.
Healthy chicks grow remarkably
fast. Coops and brooders that pro
vided plenty of room when the chicks
were first put out soon become crowd
ed. It is then time to provide more
roomy quarters. More is lost than
gained by limiting the quarters of
young chicks.
Sunflower seed is a good ration to
assist in hastening the moult, be
sides assisting to provide a variety
in the feed. Some one corner
of the poultry yard to sunflowers in
the spring in order to provide shade
for the fowls during the hot days of
summer. Thus the flowers serve two
purposes, that of furnishing shade
and food. —Farm and Ranch.
HOW TO FEED DAIRY COWS.
Professor Eckles, of the dairy de
partment of the Missouri Agricultu
ral College, in the course of a dis
cussion on feeding dairy cows laid
down the following general rules:
“1. Feed all roughness they will
eat up clean at all times.
“2. Feed one pound of grain per
day for each pound of butter-fat pro
duced per week, or one pound of
grain daily for each three gallons of
milk.
“3. Feed all the cows will take
without gain in weight.
“The rule regarding the amount
of grain of feed per day for each
cow applies best when based upon
the amount of butter-fat produced
per week, as this makes it applicable
to any breed. The second part of
the rule in regard to feeding one
pound of grain for three pounds of
milk would not work out in all cases,
since in a heavy-milking Holstein
cow this gives a little too large a
quantity of grain, and with a Jersey
giving rich milk it is a little low. It
applies best to cows producing milk
of about average composition.”
In the foregoing, Professor Eckles
refers entirely to the quantity to be
fed, and not at all to the character
to be fed. —Rural Californian.
BEE NOTES FOR APRIL.
It is not often that one gets to
look over the hives in March, unless
in the Southern States, hence the
first warm, still day in April is the
time to begin. Not only do we ex
amine the hives to see if there are
sufficient stores to last until fruit,
flowers and dandelion yield honey,
but we take advantage of the small
ness of the swarm to find and clip
the queen, if a new one has been
hatched since we last went over the
yard.
If from any cause you wish to
hatch queens later on, after drones
appear of course, be sure and locate
your strongest colony, and if this
happens to be the one which last
season gave you your largest yield
of honey, you will be pretty sure to
have a fine queen. Your queen may
not be pure Italian, but that is sec
ondary, for it is honey you want, and
we can afford to overlook defects in
color, size and even disposition.
You should have no trouble clip
ping your queen, when once you
’have found her. All you have to do
is pick her up by the head and thorax
(body), and with a small pair of
scissors cut off both wings on one
side, taking care not to cut off a leg;
but if you are timid about it, practice
on drones. Be sure and not press
on the queen’s abdomen, as being
distended with eggs, she is liable to
injury.
If you find a hive in which there
is no brood in any stage, or eggs
from which to make brood, you may
conclude that the hive has no queen.
Such a swarm would ultimately per
ish, and as it is likely that you can
get a queen in April, the best thing
to do is to double up with another
swarm. The safe way to do this is
to put a sheet of door screen wire
cloth over one hive and put the other
hive on top. Leave the wire cloth
there three days, and when you re
move it the bees will not fight. Put
the hive containing the queen above
if possible.
Hives are very apt to be short of
stores at this time of year, and if
yours are short give them sealed
comb honey, sheets of candy, or
syrup in a feeder, enough to last un
til the bees can get honey.
Be sure to clean the bottom board,
then leave the window entrance un
til warm weather sets in, or until
the swarm grows large enough to
keep warm.
From now on for a month do not
disturb the bees, unless really neces
sary to feed them. The less bees are
disturbed at this time of year the
better.—Dr. A. F. Bonny, in Farm
and Ranch.

THE VALUE OF INTENSIFIED
FARMING.
By Jno. B. Broadwell.
So much has been written in re
gard to the increased cost of living,
it prompts me to write and give my
experience as a farmer. The law of
supply and demand must govern the
price of the world’s necessities, when
the supply is greater than the de
mand prices must go down, and when
the supply is less than the demand
prices must go up.
The world moves like a pair of
scales, the heavy side goes down and
the light side goes up. The heavy
side has gone to the towns and cities,
and the light side left on the farm.
By choice I remained on the farm,
and I am on the light side, and as a
farmer I know when we make light
crops the prices go up, and when we
make heavy crops the prices go
down. Now I want to tell those
that are on the farm how I went up:
I have been for twenty years trying
to find out which was the light side
so I could get on it, for it certainly
is the profitable one for the farmer.
I have been experimenting for
twenty years and it would make this
article too long to go back and give
all the details, so I will give five
years’ experience, and I want to
show the difference in cultivating
land in cotton for five years, and
wheat followed with peas for five
years.
I claim, on our average land that
is sown in wheat and fallowed with
peas, it will gain five per bent, every
year for five years, and the hay of
the vines will be additional profit.
The same grade of land run in cot
ton for five years will lose five per
cent, each year.
The following table will show you
an average crop of both, and the
average cost of making both crops,
and average price of all three crops,
here in Milton county, Georgia. The
calculation is made on one acre in
each case; there was no toll taken
out of the cotton, nor any toll for
threshing wheat, as it would have
been about the same in both cases.
