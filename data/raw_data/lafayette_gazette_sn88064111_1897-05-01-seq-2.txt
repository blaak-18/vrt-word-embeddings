SFFiM JIUIUAL F TIIS PARISH,
iasered at the Lafayett La. P.ost-Oce as Second
Class Masier.
'SAURDAY, MAY r, 1897.
TEACIHERS SHOULD BE
PAID.
According to a resolution of the
parish School Board the public
school teachers of this parish will
be. required to attend the Summer
Normal school, to be held in Lafa
yette four weeks, beginning May 3x.
It does not appear from the official
proceedings whether the teachers are
to be paid for the time devoted to
attending the Normal, and the
teachers at their last meeting or in
stitute took the matter under con
sideration. By resolution adopted,
the Board was requested to meet in
special session, to give opportunity
for the teachers to present their
claim for payment during the four
weeks' attendance. When it is
considered that the regular school
term of ten months has been re
duced to nine by the holding of the
Summer Normal, and further con
sidering the small salary usually
paid public school teachers it
would be imposing a hardship upon
them, to enforce or even "'request"
them to devote such a length of
time in the "service of the Board"
without remuneration. We say
*"service off the Board" ad
visedly for the attendance is in
accordance with the requirements
of the resolution of the Board re
ferred to above, and that body cer
tainly expects and will demand more
efficient and methodical work of
every teacher during the next schol
astic year.
The policy of the State law is
very clearly set torth in the follow
ing excerpt, and the local Board
will doubtless conform .their action
in the premises to it: Section 64
of the school laws provides, "as a
means of improving and making
more efficient the teachers of the
public schools, of the State of
Louisiana, and awakening a deeper
public interest in said schools, the
state superintendent of public edu
cation shall cause to be held each
year at least twenty weeks of State
Teachers Institutes."
Section 70 provides that *"any
public school teacher, failing to at
tend the Institute held in his par
ish without an excuse satisfactory
to the Board of School Directors
thereof, shall immediately, upon
demand of the parish superintend
ent, forfeit his certificate and lose
his position; and each public school
teacher in attendance upon the In
stitute, shall receive the same com
pensation for the time of attend
ance, as for actual teaching,
whether the school be in session or
not."
In conclusion, let it not be sup
posed that the teachers are to sit
passively in comfortable places and
drink in refreshing and entertaining
streams of eloquence, from con
ductors gifted in all the qualifica
tions peculiar to the profession of
advanced pedagogy, but, will on
the other hand, be required to
study hard every subject assigned
and enter just as fully into the work
as if in the every day performance
of school duty. Faithful and con
scientious teachers deserve liberal
consideration, and any short
sighted policy on the part of the
Board may result in iSerious disaf
fection and ultimate injury to the
cause. Therefore in order that the
teachers may all enter into the
work with undampened ardor, The
Gazette urges that full pay be al
lowed and thus will be given an
impetus to the educational affairs
of the parish that shall redound to
the credit of all concerned.
FOSTERISM.
The 'St. Martin Messenger asks
The :azette to give a difinition of
the word Fosterism. It is this:
GGive the Republicans everything
they want except the offices.
These they must not have." For
further information apply to Jno.

THE WAIL OF THE RE
FORMERS.
The leading supporters of the
People's ticket are howling lustily
because a few Syrians have ex
pressed their intention to vote the
Democratic ticket on next Monday.
These esteemed gentlemen may be
lieve that by setting up a cry of pre
tended indignation against this class
of citizens, they will deceive some
well-meaning people who have been
taught to look upon the Syrians as
direct emissaries from the infernal
regions.
While these virtuous howlers go
about the streets talking of those
dreadful Syrians, they do not tell all
they know. They don't say a word
about their repeated attempts to get
the Syrians to vote their ticket.
After vainly trying to induce them
to vote their way and because they
failed to convince them to do so,
they denounce them as the vilest
things on earth, and would, if they
could, send them to the demnition
bow-wows.
To those who know how much
the managers of the People's
ticket tried to win the Syrians
over to the combine, this hypocriti
cal talk is very amusing.
The Gazette does not hesitate to
say that not one man running on
the People's ticket from the candi
date for mayor down to the one whose
name adorns the tail end, would
have any conscientious scruples
about accepting the votes of the
Syrians. If The Gazette is mis
taken in making this assertion, then
it will have no fear to proclaim
that these awfully virtuous candi
dates have too much conscience to
be on the People's ticket and not
enough sense to be councilmen.
Since when have our friends be
come s0caristocratic that they will
not accept any kind of a vote?
It's not so long ago that some of
the leading supporters of the
People's ticket used to pen up ne
groes and drive them to the polls
like cattle. And now because they
can not get the vote of the Syrians,
they become wrathy and affect to
solict the support of irreproachable
and sFotless gentlemen only ? But
now that they have gotten to be so
fastidious they will have to part
company with some of their long
haired disciples who have not been
within speaking distance of a ton
sorial establishment for the last two
or three decades. We know it will
be a cruel separation, but the cause
of municipal reform and political
purity demands the sacrifice.
It was in 1893 -that the faction
now supporting the People's ticket
were placed in control of the town's
business by one vote. In those
days they were not so hard to
please. It was uncomfortably
close and all votes were acceptable.
The contest was about to be ended
and the result was doubtful. The
gentlemen on the other side fore
saw the downfall of the dynasty.
The last column in the old super
structure whose magnificence daz
zled the world in the palmy days of
the ring was on the eve of crum
bling down to dust. It was a sol
emn moment for the tiger. But,
lo ! beneath the ancient ruins of
the threatened temple, appeared
the majestic form of a faithful
brave. It was Adolphus Poulette, of
unwritten fame and blonde mous
tache, who softly glided to the bal
lot box, and when the golden rays
of the setting sun had bidden au
revoir to mother earth and the
curfew had tolled the knell of
patting day, the die was cast.
Poulette had hatched a municipal
chicken whose few remaining
feathers will be found floating in
the ambient air on the morning of
May 5
. An Ohio editor says that fever is
caufsed by kissing grass widows. A
Missouri editor says it is caused by
a grass widow kissing a fellow by
moonlight. An Iowa editor says it
is caused by the fellow kissing the
girl while she is feeding hay to the
cow, and an eastern Kansas ex
change is of the opinion that it is
Scaused by missing the girl and kiss
Sing the cow. A poetical editor says
that it is caused by too much kiss
in the heyday of youth.
