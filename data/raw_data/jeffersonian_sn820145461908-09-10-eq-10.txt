BRYAN’S TROUBLES IN THE
SOUTH.
Polling Only One-third of the Vote.
I hope Coxey will be able to meet
a series of appointments in this state.
There is a great chance for us sure
ly. We have just had a primary elec
tion to nominate candidates and the
Democrats in the state did not poll
one-third of their vote. In our coun
ty, Noxubee, with eleven hundred reg
istered, they polled only three hun
dred and ninety-five. Bryan’s posi
tion on the negro question is the
cause of this. The Democrats plainly
tell me that they would rather see the
Democrats defeated than to win with
the negro vote.
It is the same in Alabama, although
that state has not had a primary to
show the situation so plainly, but I
live near the border and see and talk
with a great many persons in that
state. The Democrats are discour
aged and will be glad to vote for a
live issue. I truly believe there is a
good chance for us to carry Missis
sippi. The non-bearing bond is a
great favorite in this state, and peo
ple will go a long distance to hear
Coxey.

Benjamin Teague, Isabella, Tenn.:
“I am in business here, but will
go home to Ivy Log, Ga., twenty-five
miles from here, to vote for my great
Watson and Williams.”
John B. Gibson, Yatesville,’Ga.:
“The fact that Bryan, the man
who had rather be President than be
right, has, for the third time, been
nominated' by the old defunct party,
is sufficient only to provoke laughter,
excite criticism and to augment the
desire to ridicule.”
J. J. Brown, Bowman, Ga.:
“We will redeem old Franklin in
November. God knows we are right,
and, being in the right, we will fight
as we have never fought before. Al
low us to again assure you of our
loyal support.”
W? J. White, Meigs, Ga.:
“I am going to do everything I can
for you in this campaign. I think
we will carry old Thomas this time,
several men who say they are going
to vote for you that have never voted
anything but a Democratic ticket.
They say they can’t swallow W. J.
Bryan. ’ ’
S. M. Langdon, Hackberry, Okla.:
“This country is ready for reform.
Just a start is all that is needed.”
t
B. G. Morris, Achibald, Okla.:
“Don’t you suppose the pure blue
blooded Southern Democrats feel aw
fully ridiculous in this campaign?
When they remember how, though
overpowered and beaten down, their
property destroyed and their homes
burned by the Northern hosts, they
and their fathers stood up like men
of steel and fought negro government
to a cold and successful finish—when
they remember this, must they not
feel deeply humiliated to take Bryan
and his Northern ‘niggers’ by the
hand and say, ‘We entrust the Dem
ocratic party to your keeping, its
honor and destiny; help us to power
and we will help you to revenge your
self upon your enemy, who punished
you for shooting up a Southern town
and murdering its innocent citi
zens. ’ ’ ’
S. G. Bostick, Marshall, Tex.:
“I am still expecting great things
of you and good things from you for
the people. I was nominated on the
Citizens party ticket in this county
as Representative in the 31st Legis
lature. This is a white people’s par-
15 b a 3effersonian
ty in the county composed of all
white voters, regardless of their par
ties.”
A. C. Stovall, Quanah, Tex.:
“You will find enclosed $lO, for
subscriptions to the Jeffersonians.
Mr. Watson, I do not want any com
mission for what I have done for
your publications. ’ ’
Jesse A. <Swango, Chetopa, Kan.:
“If the Populists were able to crys
tallize the Populist sentiment into
a working organization, Tom Watson
would be next President of the Unit
ed States. Nobody fights him much.
Only office hunters in the Democratic
party, and those Democrats who are
so blind they cannot see Bryan’s
treachery to the principles he once
advocated. ’ ’
C. A. Fomby, Hamlin, Tex.:
“The Jeffersonians are the best po
litical papers to be found. I am 'an
‘Old Guard’ Populist and strictly
believe in a government by the people
and for the people. I also think that
we will never be able to obtain this
from either of the old parties, which
are obviously in the hands of political
schemers. Hope you great success in
your campaign.”
. I
From a Subscriber:
“Mr. Watson, my heart’s desire
and prayer to God is that Georgia’s
electoral vote may be cast for you. I
have never faltered nor wavered in
my devotion to Populism and have
always followed where you have led;
am proud of our creed and I’ve no
idea of surrendering until the ‘last
armed foe expires.’ Comrades, pa
triots, let ‘Georgia for Watson’ be
our (Shibboleth, let it be our aim, let
us make one supreme effort and I be
lieve victory will be ours.”
J. B. Stone, Mansfield, La.:
“We are making an effort now to
get the Watson and Williams elect
ors on the official ballot. I hope to
poll a respectable vote for you in this
parish this time. I have been with
you since 1892 in principle and have
never voted otherwise.”
W. F. Woodford, Farmdale, Fla.:
“What do you think of the Bryan
‘negroism’? He is tearing down
what the (South has been building up
for the last forty years. How can a
Southern man vote for him?”
POPULISTS NEWS.
From Texas, Mississippi, Florida,
Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia
come the news that a great awaken
ing is taking place among the Peo
ple’s party forces. Hon. Thos. E.
Watson has been making a great cam
paign in Georgia and the people by
the thousands have been flocking to
his meetings. The assertion that he
will carry Georgia this fall would
seem to be a safe one and with Geor
gia leading out for Mr. Watson the
effect on the other (Southern states
is great and they are all getting out
a Watson and Williams electoral tick
et and organizing for an active cam
paign. Mr. Watson has got the peo
ple of the South to thinking that if
the South would secure national rep
utation they must cease voting inces
santly for candidates put up by
northern states and do a little voting
for candidates selected from South
ern states. The South loves Watson
and are beginning to realize his real
worth. The people of the South are
also beginning to realize that their in
fluence in the national government is
not what the wealth and population
of the South entitles it to be and
that a section of country that fur
nished the nation with a Jefferson
and a Jackson, a Madison and a
Monroe, is not barren of statesmen
at this time qualified to fill the Pres
idential chair. For the last fifty
years the southern states have fur
nished over two-thirds of the Dem
ocratic Presidential Electorals and
never had a candidate on the Presi
dential ticket.
The South can give its electoral
vote to Mr. Watson without increas
ing* Mr. Taft’s chances of winning
this year, for Mr. Watson and his fol
lowers are strenuously opposed to Mr.
Taft’s election. For the South to
give its electoral vote to Democratic
electors, will not decrease Mr. Taft’s
chances of winning. For the south
ern states to give its electoral vote
to Mr. Watson would secure for the
South a national recognition such as
it has not enjoyed since Polk was
elected. Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Jack
son were great statesmen of their
day; but so is Mr. Watson of his day
which demands statesmen of greater
breadth than an 18th and 19th cen
tury civilization demanded.—People’s
Voice, Norman, Okla.
