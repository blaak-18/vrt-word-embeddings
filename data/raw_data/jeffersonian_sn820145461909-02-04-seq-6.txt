DEVOTED TO PRINCIPLES.
i
Spread, Ga., Dec. 10, 1903. 1
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Although the election is .
over and you are suffering the after
math of defeat, still we are glad that
it can be truly said that old Warren 1
county clogged the wheels of defeat '
as far as she is concerned —she stood 1
firm, as usual, for our fearless
‘ ‘Hero’ ’ —judging from the past, War
ren county would stand for Watson,
the man, if she stood alone on the
field. She stands for principle, and
not for party or number of votes.
Prniciple is the drawing card in all
great reforms of which we have any
account in the past history of our
country and this great nation of
which we are all so proud. Any reform
of Church or State had its 11 pioneers” i
bold and fearless, who dared to stand, i
if alone. And the pioneer spirit is
that which lighted the torch (at the
stake) in old England which has never
been extinguished, and the principle
for which the Populist party stands
today is that which our posterity will
honor and look upon, even in the 2Gth
century, as the golden age of their
liberty. Never before has it been true
when so-called Democrats would vote
the Republican ticket rather than for
their own filial party. But it seems
that times are changing, and with
times people are also changing (we
trust for the better). We will stand
firm as the rocks of Gibraltar, talk,
write, trust, and work for the right
principles for which the “Pops”
stand, not only for the next four
years, but so long as life shall last.
Till death shall overtake us, if the
party should forever be annihilated,
even then we would stand at death
upon the immortal principle, because
of its justice and its righteous founda
tion. The principles are right, un
tarnished, immovable, and abide for
ever. The opposing faction realize
the truth of this—they are fast fall
ing in line —by embracing and fram
ing measures by the “Old Populists’
timepiece, though they won’t own the
origin. They are like the old woman
who said “she liked mutton, but
couldn’t stand sheep, because she got
the wool in her teeth.”
Respectfully,
Mrs. E. L. Grimes.
LIKES DR. CLARKE’S SUGGES
TION.
Jeddo, Ala., Dec. 29, 1908.
Editor Jeffersonian:
By all means let’s have a confer
ence, and let it be a conference of
the right sort. By a conference of
the right sort, I mean one that has in
view a purpose to unite all reformeis
under one banner.
All who have read Dr. Clark’s com
munication in the Jeffersonian of De
cember 10th will agree with me, I
think, in saying that he hit the key
note of success when he proposed that
we adopt a new name and confine our
platform to a single plank. Diiect
legislation. Every one can see that
it is a wide, strong, oak plank that
could accommodate Populists, Social
ists, Prohibitionists, and Independ
ents, and all others who have tried to
get reforms through the old parties.
Let’s unite our strength, thereby
not only giving, greater power, but
also making'fewer opponents.
I suggest that the first conference
be held between Watson, Hearst,
Debs, Vardaman, Folk, and Lafolett.
lette. Then, if an agreement is reach
ed, a joint conference of all reformers
can be called to arrange the details
and prepare for a thorough organiza
tion.
Let’s hear from others in regard to
this.

ANOTHER OF SAME VIEW.
Centuria, Wis., Dec. 14, 1908.
Editor Jeffersonian:
The article by Dr. J. W. Clark, in
the Jeffersonian of December 10th,
strikes a responsive chord in my bo
som, for I have been saying for at
least ten years that the People’s
Party ought to drop every question
but the Initiative, Referendum and
Recall, and make their fight upon
these issues. Without the power these
principles give the people they are
powerless to accomplish anything of
benefit to themselves; with them,
time will work out all reforms and
break up party spirit, and the people
will become more intelligent on econo
mic questions, or questions that relate
to their well-being, outside of party
ascendency. Personally, I am in full
sympathy with the principles of the
People’s party, but since coming to
Wisconsin have affiliated with the
Prohibition party, but would at once
put the Outlook in line with every
thought of a new movement on these
lines. Issue an address to the coun
try for the formation of such a move
ment, and it will receive hearty ap
proval from thousands, for they can
not help seeing the necessity for it.
Yours truly,
J. R. Lowe.
STILL ANOTHER INDORSER.
Owassa, Ala., Dec. 12, 1908.
Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I haVe been wanting to
write you every since the election,
but have been dowm with fever. I
went in the rain to the election and
whooped up Watson all day. The
vote went: Taft 1, Bryan 2, Watson
10. This county would have gone
for you if we had been organized. I
endorse Dr. J. W. Clark’s plan to or
ganize for the Initiative, Referendum
and Recall. The people would come
to us on the money question,
when it was fully explained to them.
You will please explain in your
paper the Initiative, Referendum and
Recall. What is it? I, like a great
many others, do not fully understand
them.
Mr. Watson, I want you to stay in
the tight, as the whole thing would
be dead without you. And when you
make a call for a conference, then
call for money to defray the ex
penses, and I will chip in all I can.
I want to propose a plan to double
the subscription of your Jeffersonian
paper, say by the 15th of January
or Ist of February, which is this:
For every reader of your paper to
set a resolution that he was going to
get one subscriber by that time if he
■©fc* TJeffersonlan
had to go down in his pocket for the
SI.OO. I will do it. Now all of you
do the same, and do not call for any
commission, as Mr. Watson has done
enough for us for nothing. I have
sent in several subscribers, but I do
not want any commission. And I
never destroy any of Watson’s pa
pers and magazines, but mail and
hand them out to others, and tell them
to read Watson and learn something.
I have been talking to several of the
old Pops, and told them that Watson
was going to call a conference for the
purpose of reorganizing; that the
Pops were coming to stay, and all are
anxious for it. I have talked Watson
so much that a great many people call
me Watson. I tell them that I could
not be honored any more highly than
to be called after as great a man as
Tom Watson. lam such a fool about
Watson that one of my daughters has
named her baby boy Tom Watson.

VOICE FROM THE WEST.
Boise, Idaho, Jan. 4. 1909.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson.
Dear Sir: I waited for a voice from
the West. No one has said a word
about the West, and I propose to say
it, and if what I say don’t suit the
West, I dare them deny it.
We must organize, and I think w r e
will have to change the party name.
If we do have to drop the name Popu
list, call it National Reform party, or
Jeffersonian party, or People’s Inde
pendent party, or call it anything,
just so you don’t use the word Demo
cratic. My experience is that very
few men in the North and West will
ever associate with a party called
Democratic. Almost all who believe in
the Populist principles voted with the
Republicans, or did not vote at all.
I am taking the Weekly Jefferso
nian, the grandest paper in America.
I will renew soon and get some one
else to take it.
MAJORITY FEARED PARTY
LASH.
Bowersville, Ga., Nov. 21, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson: The election is
over, and the Democrats claim you are
short of votes, but it seems from the
election reports they are going back
wards to the tune of thousands upon
thousands.
Just think, for a moment, that all
of the big dailies and very nearly all
of the weeklies were crying out in
every home in Georgia to stand by the
nominees of the Democratic party!
What an influence they have over the
minds of the average voter. Suppose
that you, Mr. Watson, had been back
ed up by just half of those papers,
you wrnuld have carried this State
over both of them, for the majority
of the voters were inclined towards
your election, but feared the party
lash.
I honestly believe if every true
friend to you, and a just cause that
you represent, will see to it that three
or four of his neighbors, who have
never read the Jeffersonian, read it
for the next twelve months, the re
sult will be wonderful. Let us take
courage and renewed energy and
march onward to victory.
A friend of yours and justice,
W. J. Glover.
HOLD FAST TO PRINCIPLES.
■ »
Hucal. Texas, Dec. 21, 1908.
Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: In regard to the con
ference, would say make the call as
soon as convenient. Invite all re
formers and all dissatisfied old party
men. But let the conference be strict
ly under the control of the Populists.
Hold fast to the name Populist and
all of the Populist principles. We
have nothing to barter for success,
or anything else. Might as well ask
Tom Watson to change his name and
convictions for the sake of office as
to ask the* Populists to change their
name and drop two-thirds of their
platform for the sake of success as a
party.
F. S. Taylor.
CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME.
Atoka, Tenn.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I must commend you in
the stand you have taken in answer
to Wm. A. Green, of Oglethorpe, Ga.
You are right, charity begins at home.
The ways of man are not the ways
of God. You are looking at the mat
ter with truth, knowledge and love.
It matters not what man’s doctrine or
creeds say, the present w r ay of carry
ing the Gospel to the heathen is a man
invention.
Well, I read the answer in the
Jeffersonian to “By What Right,”
and am glad that God has got men
planted in the world that will speak
the sentiments of their heart as you
have done.
Yours truly,
Jno. W. Clark.
