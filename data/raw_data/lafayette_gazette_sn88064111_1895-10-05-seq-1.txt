LITTLE DAMES AND MEN.
We all must remember when
.Ye were little dames and men:
When each sorrow tugged away with all its
might
At our little hearts and eyes.
'ill the air was full of sighs.
And the brightest day was turned to darkest
night.
How we'd weep.
How we'd creep
To our little beds to sleelp
With wet lashes on flushed faces: even then.
Not a soul would ever know
Half our agony: and so
We should sympathize with little dames and
men.
We must all remember when
We were little dames sad men.
When we meet the little ones from day id dta;
A kind word is just as cheap.
And it sinks to depths as deep
As the harsh one you were sending down their
way.
If you knew
How a few
Oracious acts and words from veot
Were planted in their souls: to blossom When
Golden days of childhood seem
To be shadows of a dream.
You would love and cherish little dames and
menIC.

M'GHEOGHAN'S LAPSE.
BY 'ILLIS CHAMBERLAIN.
'G H EOG IIAN
had kept sobrl'
a long time. F"or
weeks he had
not even taken
a glass of whis
ky with stimmy Sullivan, and he used
to drop into Jimmy's every evening,
"just to wash the dust from his t'roat,"
as he phrased it. The washing process
had developed into such proportions
that McGheoghan's wife said he might
as well "dhrown himselt and be done
wid it." Then she applied what she
called the "wather cure," and Mc
Gheoghan reformed. Mrs. McGheo
ghan had such faith in the reforma
tion that Flhe had taken the baby and
gone for three days to her cousins, the
O('Flannigans. in SauceIito: and the
only admonition she had given her
husband was the parting injunction:
'Mind yer eye, now, Maurice."
MIc(;heoghan had not been particu
larly proud of his descent from the Me
(:heoghans. of Galway. but his young
wife continually dinned it intohim that
they were "a fine ould family," and
that he ought not to disgrace them by
associating with people beneath him.
It was bad enough to be poor, she said,
without mixing with the common herd.
As a distinguishing mark, she always
gave an Italian pronunciation to her
husband's name, Maurice, and insisted
upon his doing the same. Mrs. Mc
(Gheoghtn had learned Italian in her
youth among the fishermen of. North
BIeach. Maurice did not take his
wife's discipline kindly, and it was
only his love for her that made him
endure it. Out of her sight he liked to
be one of the boys. and in sly ridicule
of her aristocratic pretensions spoke of
himself as a "humin illevator"-he
elevated bricks by the hodful up a
ladder.
When McGheoghan pushed quietly
through the screen doors, slipped un
obtrusively past the crowd at the bar,
sat down at the last table, and began
looking at the prints in the Irish News.
Jimmy Sullivan knew something was
in the wind: for had not the O'Rourkes
told his wife that Mrs. McGheoghan
had forbidden her husband to have
anything to do with that "low-down
shaloon-keeper, Jimmy Sullivan?"
"What'll yez have, me bye?" called
Jimmy, as the last man drew one of the
three towels hanging before the bar
across his dripping mustache and
swung himself out into the street.
"Faith, but it's a long time since
I've had the good luck to grip yer fist,
man. Here's the crame o' the sason till
ye."
If the thought of his wife came to
the hod-carrier at all, it probably
brought a suggestion to make hay
while the sun shone, for he and Jimmy I
filled and emptied glass after glass
while they smoked black cigars and
chatted over the "ould times" when
they were single. Sullivan kept the
clearer head, for it was part of his
TlE TWO WVERE F(IGHLTIO .LKE CATr. e
business to do so, but even his speech t
grew thick and he spilled his stock as
he served the two or three late cus- t
tomers that came in before hlie and MIc- i
(;heoghan were left to themselves.
Long after the usual time of closing,
Sullivan's wife. who lived over the sa- c
loon; looked timidly in through the i
back door and asked Jimmy when he ,
was coming home.
"'Git to -- out o here wid ye, and
mind yer own business." was his an
swer. "That's the way I talk till my ,
wife, Morris," he said. "You'd be bet- 1
ther off if you'd give yer own a taste I
av the same when she's deludherin ye t
,vid her hifalutin idees."
~McGheoghan recalled the time when
be had known Mrs. Sullivan as pretty
Kitty LafFerty; and the barkeeper'sa
manner jarred the pleasant recollec
tioni he did not like to see his old
flame treated like that, lie did not t
relish free advice, either: and when
Sullivan spoke stgIlhtingly of Mri. lc

wrong, and that Sullivan was rejoleag
in his larse from virtue. 'To maint'n
his dignity he considered it neeesrsavy
to impress n11iliaait with the fact thiia
the McGhoeghans Werd peopid it* be
respected, so he says:
"Me name's Mowreechv."
"That's another fool idee yer wife.s
made ye swally. Morris was good
enough .for ye when ye was a bye, but
when ye got married yer t-ifc tnist goa
changin' yer name. But ye'r Morris
for all that"
"Me name's Mowreechy, and if ye
go fer to call me out av it, or say me
wife's name ag'in, I'll bate ye wid that
mug "
Sullivan leered at liitn defisi*tly:
"Yer name's Morris McGheoghatd,
and yer wife's a flannel-mouthed chaw
like yerself."
The impact of a beer glass over Sulli
van's left eye caused him to measure
his length upon the fl)or: The shock
roused him, however, and iii Ii iidrieflit
the two were fighting like cats. The
crash of overturned tables and chairs
and of breaking glass would have caught
the attention of the patrol had that in
rlivisal not been dosing in the next
block. It would have awakened Mi's.
Sullivan had sie not been at that par
ticular time half asphyxiated in her
sleep by a smoking mantel-spread
which had fallen over the lamp left
burning for her husband.
The flre had snmostlder id for half at
hour and the room was filled with
smoke, when a spark fell on the table
and ignited a bit of paper. In an in
stant the room was in a blate. A btiui;i
ing curtain caught the eye of a late
traveler, who turned in an alarm. The
hook-and-ladder truck dashed up to
the place, and a fireman snatched thh
stupefied woman out of a burning bed,
but he did not notice the adjacent a -
cove where little four-year-old Kittý
Sullivan lay dreaming.
WVhen Maurice McGheoghan was
shoved away from his antagonist lie

Kitty?" roused an idea in his head
The McGheohans of Galway had nobli
blood in their veins, and never desert
ed a female in distress.
The firemen were busy saving Sulli
van's stock. They did not heed the un
couth figure, with bloody face and
torn clothes, reeling through the bacL
door and up the narrow stairs

and flame he groped his way. while

inst beside his wife, sprinkling her face
and chafing her wrists.
She opened her eyes and gasped:
"Kitty." Sullivan had thought that of
course the child was saved with its
mother, but now the fear struck him
that this was not so. He ran from one
to another of the bystanders, frantic in
his search, but no one had seen the
little girl. As in desperation he turned
to the burning rookery, a window
crashed out, and a burst of flame lighted
his road to the little stairway. He
sprang toward it and nearly overturned
a staggering, ragged, blackened and
begrimed man carrying in his arms a
bundle of bedclothes, from out of
which a voice called to Jimmy:
"Papa! '

Spurs for Gameeocks.
Steel heels or spurs for fighting
cocks to take the place of the natural
spur are made in twenty or more va
rieties in shape and length; they are
sold all over the world. In the United
States spur.s of different styles are
used in different parts of the country;
longer spurs are used in the south than
in the east and north. The shortest
spurs are used in New York. The
standard length here is one and one
quarter inches; in all other parts of
the country the length is advanced.
A good set of steel heels costs ten dol
lars. The spur projects from one side
of a ferrule or socket, which is like an
open thimble; a leather band is at
tached to the base of the ferrule. The
natural spur is sawed off, and when
the steel spur is used the ferrule is
placed over the stump and the leather
band is wound round the cock's leg
and bound with twine; a pad or
cushion is placed within the rim of the
ferrule to make it fit the stomp of the
natural spur snugly and firmly. It is
said that if a well-bred gamecock,
which had been without ftod until it
was nearly starred, should then be
placed in the presence of another
gamecock and of food, it would fight
before it would eat; in other words.
that it would rather fight than eat.

pla$inly initnded to be taken without
refereial itd tEid *seerlainable proofs
to the contrary.

inflicted upon all manner of persons
beeatise, me it is alleged, payments that
ate due it-id the treasury are withheld
to enable the tfeasdry to tmakle a
report that will discredit partisan pre
dictIons.
If the readers of these rash and per
sistently wrong reports will take the
tfdiibl to ticahdifle the daily reports of
the state of tht ttufisuti adtd compare
the expenditures with thd aipfbprio
tions, it will become apparent at onCe
that the pensioners, for instance, are
not being deprived of the money ap
proprinted for them. The approprin
tion for pensiese for the year begin
ning July 1 was $14i,13~,600. 'That
would be at the rate of $11,781,780 pe1
month. According to the report made
by the treasury, there had been paid
out on July 18 on account of iS p1nson
s$1,237,000,or at the rate of about $18,
000,000 for the month.
Take.the war department, which ap
pears to have drawn $3,304,000 in 1$
days. The figures do not suggest that
appropriations have been withheld
from that branch of the service, for
the amount appropriated for the army
is about $23,250,000, or at the rate of
less than $2,000,000 a month. The
treasury has honored requisitions in a
little more than half the month far in
excess of the monthly average of the
yearly appropriation for war. The
navy is entitled to an average expendi
ture of $2,801,000. It has received 81,
881.000 in 18 days of July, or at the rate
of about $100,000 daily. Should the
rate of payments on navy account be
maintained, the navy will have ex
ceeded by July 31 the average to which
it appears to be entitled.
Has the secretary of the treasury
withheld appropriations from the In
dians? The allowance for Indian ex
penditures for the year was $8,000,000,
or 8741,666 per month. During the
18 days of July there was drawn
from the treasury on account of Indian
expenses 8476,000. If the treasury had
cared to withhold money and to issue
it only upon a schedule arranged to
restrict the outgo it might have saved
$32,000 in the 18 days. If the
rate of payment for the first half of
the month is maintained until July 31
the average to which the Indians are
apparently entitled will have been
considerably exceeded.
The criticisms which have provoked
these illustrations of their falsity do
not really deserve further explanation.
It is absurd to imagine that they are
believed by anybody except possibly
the men who talk so glibly and fool
ishly and ignorantly about the "'mis
represantatioa" that.is prastic nd.to .fur
nish a good showing. No one who has
a valid demand upon the treasury is
likely to hold it beyond the time it can
be presented with reasonable expecta
tion that it will be honored. The dis
position of rejected applicants for pay
ment to make .a fuss about delays
would speedily advertise any general
tendency to delay on the part of the
treasury officers. If delays have oc
curred, if they have been common, in
large number and for large amounts
of money due, who has prevailed upon
the postponed creditors to keep so pro
found a silence? Why do not the prat
ers about the government postpone
ments of pay give some particulars to
make plausible the charge that pay
ments are not met with reasonable
and customary promptness?- N. Y.

PROTECTION WAGES.
What the btecKnley Law Did for the
Worklngman.
The Springfield Register stated some
days ago that wages in the rolling
mills at that place are ten per cent.
higher now than the average rate un
der the McKinley tariff act. The
Springfield Journal, a republican pro
tection paper, makes a curious com
ment on this statement, but does not
deny its truth.
The Journal says: "The wages of
the men at the rolling mills are now
one hundred per cent. less than they
were ten years ago under protection
and union rules." This is evidently a
slip of the pen. "One hundred per
cent. less" means nothing. "he organ
probably meant fifty per cent. less, or
one-half the amount ten years ago.
There is also obscurity in the refer
ence to "union rules" ten years ago. It
required not only ironclad protection
for the mill owners, but union rules by
the mill men to keep wages up. Prob
ably protection had very little to do
with it, and the compulsion of union
ules by which the mill owners were
held caused the high rate of wages.
lut the republican organ dodges the
qnestion. It speaks about wages ten
years ago. That was five years before
the McKinley tariff law was enacted.
The statement of the democratic paper
at Springfield "s that wages are higher
now than under the McKinley tariff
fre years ago. Thatfact is notdenied.
But it is said that wages are only half
as high as ten years ago. It must have
been, then, that wages were reduced
one-half under the McKinley tariff.
This is apparently trivial, but it is
really important. It amounts to a con
ession from an organ that McKinley
iages were less than the wages that
proevailed under the previous tarif. It
shows that present wages are higher
than tlee McKinley scale, It itio a oom

Whast the friet of the ftlgh Protectle
istis I .llelt to Ie.
Through reports from l1I along the
line it is made plain that republican
leaders Intend to force the tariff ques
tion tO tile front as the overshadowiin
issue of the next national campaign.
hefaw are signs unmistakable that
some kind of a truce has been patched
up between the Cllisr millionaires and
the tariff barons the latter to become
the direct beneficiaries of a high pro
tective system should their party gain
ehsitfel in the country, and the former
to be rew:titded for the repression of
financial agitation within their own
rahks by having the governmeut re
sume the purchase of silyvr bullion for
storage in the treasury. Not only
have Me~linley, Harrison. Allison and
e#*is Morton indicated with greater or
less enmphasi. that the republican war
cry of '90 arid '92 will be revived,
but prominent spell-binders of the
party in almost every section are givr
ing utterance to the same sentiment.
Atnotig the latest echoes of the re
#ttblidan campaign keynote was Sena
tor (ualt'tt, of Illinois. To the assem
blage of his partisans at Springfield he
said: "When the republican party gets
control again, as it will next year,
ivish some republican for president, we
will take up the tariff act and go over
it item by Item and make such amend
ments to it as will give reasonable pro
tection to American labor and Amer
ican industries as against foreign labor
and foreign industries. The people of
this country never knew they wanted
that sort of protection; they were never
certain of it until the democrats, by
iistake, got 1ossesslon of this country
two years egof."
In this brief statement the senator
virtually tells the people of the United
States that they are fools; for it was
they who committed the "mistake"
which he seeks to pervert into a wide
spread calamity. ANot only were they
guilty of thIla "mistake" in 189:J when
their repudiation of high protectiol
and of its representatives was the most
emphatic on record, but two years
later they gave an overwhelming con
firmation of the original judgment
rendered. During the interval they
had ample time and opportunity to
test the practical workings of the sys
tem against which they had pro
nounced within a month of the time
when it became operative. They stud
ied it with an acuteness and an earn
estness begotten of self-interest, and,
with full knowlesge of its bearings
upon the welfare of tnh country, they
again placed upon it the seai of their
disapproval. They saw that the ic
Kinley law was framed in the interest
of a special few, that it exacted extnr
tionate tribute from the masses to the
classes, that was responsible for the
worst political corruption the country
has ever known and that it was rapid
ly building up a moneyed autocracy
that would in the end usurp from the
people their right of self government.
But it is to be hoped that the repub
lican leaders will continue to regard
their most memorable defeats as a
"mistake" on the part of the voters.
Democracy accepts the challenge. It
waives the charges of hypocrisy, incon
sistency and broken faith to which
those of the opposition throw them
selves open, for when they were only
an obstructive minority they never
ceased to condemn ta iff agitation as
disastrous to the country, causing un
certainty, destroying confidence and
paralyzing trade. The issue will be
fought upon its merits. It will be
found that the fatal mistake was made
when the unscrupulous managers of
the g. o. p. tried to place the democrat
ic administration In a false position.
An era of reviving trade and prosperi
ty is more eloquent than words can be
in vindicating the wisdom of democra
cy and convincing the people that they
made no mistake. Actual results con
stitute evidence so conclusive that
even republican trickery cannot evade
or republican cunning dissipate it.-De
