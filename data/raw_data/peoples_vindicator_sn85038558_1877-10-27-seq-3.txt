nopsis of a lecture recently delivered on thi
the subject of hu
The Promises of Cod. Ea
A promise is an assuran('e gi'en i hell
God, in his revealed word, of lbstow ing
celtain blessings therein slpeceiied. ulpu,
his people; as we read "W\htercby are giv
n unto us exceedinlg great and precious thl
piromises that hv these ye light be par
takers of the l)i'inie nature, having es'a- co
ped the corruption that is in the world Il
through uInst.'
The first promise made to man bly God
is contained in the third chapter of Gen- th
esis, fifteenth verse, imimeditttely afterour T
first parents had violated the Divine law,
here we nuderstand that lthe son of (God ill
will delhlrone the power of satan, but
that in the accomplis)hmnut of this great
act he shall be "'Inuised," shall stll'er
death. The promise is that through his
, death and sltfering we may lie saved.
The first pir onmise is like a sparkling
brook gurgling out from tl'e mountain
- side, ripldinug, dashing, leaping with sil
Svery tongue firon crag to crag; gladly
falling in with other streams, growing,
t broadening, deepenin ngg by the accession c'
of other waters, ma king then mighty river l
that murmurs on to the rolling oceanu.- n
It Thus these precious ilihe prollises grow at
and mnultiply, fresh, stirams of promiises di
flow in from each chapter, and when we ti
appropriate these by faith, they bear us P
r on grandly to the great ocean of God's It
perfect love, these Divine winds of aid cl
will begin to blow, and the silvery waves o
or of proimise will dash our happy souls up ti
to the pearly gates of the new Jerusalem '
and we will be greeted with that wel- '
Collie plaudit "Enter thou into the joys t'
oft thy Lord."
How unllbhounded should our faith he in N
tihe prmises of God, especially when we II
Icremember that they have lbeen verilled t
when the terms upon which they were J
s. made have been complied with. Instance: 1
The great blessings bestowed on the 1
apostles and others ol thie day of Penti
cost. The Bible teaches us, that Christ
was assembled with his disciples "and
commanded them that they should not
15 depart from ,'Jerusalem, hut wait for the 1
promise of tilhe Father, which saith he, ye
lave heard of Me, for John truly bapti- 1
lie zed with water, but ye shall h, baptized

hence-" In order to obtain this promise
i the apostles, and Mary the mother of Je
'or sus, and devout womnen, and followers of
our blessed Lord, about one hundred and
twenty in all "continued with one accord

ticost vwas fully come, they were all with
Sone accordl in one place, and suddenly
on there came a sound from Heaven, as of a

personally and officiallv are all mere
bosh and the effusion of disappointed
amnbitions to avenge ill tieling and to
cover up their misdeeds and past otfl'nces
of which they are guilty and which they
will misarlbly fail to do. The charges
preferred in this letter are frivolous aulndrst
ridiculous and carry their own refutation
lupon their face, in this, that the Police
Jury simply raised the Treasurer's cnm
Imissions fromn 2- per cent to 5 per cent
on account of additional duties being imn- 4
posed upon him in that calnacity, which
was perfectly true andl legitimate, and
which is but small pay in our parish and
1 aftords but a very meagre compensation
ifor his services at the reduced price ot'
- parish papel"'r. But this is not all, they
were advised on the subject of the Super
visor's claim against the parish and a law
a suit was incurred at a great expense to
e the parish Which is a most willful mis
e representation and perversion of the facts
e of the case. A suit was instituted and
, they invoked in the suit the levy and
collection of a special tax to pay the
debt contrary to the law which the Pc
It lice Jury resisted through their Attorney 1
and after obtaining judgment an appeal
was taken to the District Court and re- t
c versed and the party holding the claim
pa) ing the cost of appeal. This is a spe
cimen of the truthfulness of Probono
Publico. The Police Jury is character
ized by this writer as dishonest. ignorant
and stupid, which is a vile and infamous
slauder upon that Honorable Body, fer
they are intelligent and respectable men
In any community and time will demon
strate the wisdom and etliciency of their
policy in the administration of the paro
e chial affairs of the parish of Sabine.
SRespectfully,
E. F. PRESLEY.
GARRETT-On Tuesday the 16th inst.,
at a few minutes before 1 o'clock, P. M.,
with Congestive Fever, in the fifteenth
year of his age, PIZARRO GARIRET'I ,
eldest son of A. M. and A. E. Garrett, of
Campte, in this parish.
The deceased was a youth of much
promise; was a dntiful son, an attection
ate brothir and amiable friend. If im
pluse, as with so many others, sometimes
led him astray, his manly instincts Imade
atonement by a full correction of the
wrong. That he was highly estimated
in the community was attested by the
nnmerous cone urse at his funeral, and
the many moistened eyes iunused to weep
sympathy for the dead, as for his sorrow
ing relatives, tilled every heart. Requies
eat in pace. A FRIEND.
