VOL. V. LAFAYETTE, LA., -SATURDAY, MAY 29, 1897. NO. 13.
THE ANSWER
Piled Denics That Any Praud Was
Committed by the Democrats.
Judge S. D. Read, of Calcasieu,
to whom the contested election case
was transferred by Judge Debaillon,
who recused himself, presided over
the District Court Thursday. The
case was fixed for trial for June 23.
The defendants filed a bill of excep
tion to the jurisdiction of the court
on the ground of the unconstitution
ality of the acts of the Legislature
under which the contest was
brought. Messrs. Winston Over
ton, Chas. D. Caffery and Orther
C. Mouton, the defeudants' coun
sel, filed the following answer to
the petition of the contestants:
"'Now into court come defendants
in above entitled and numbered
cause, who, reserving their rights
under the exceptions of want of
jurisdiction ratione materiae, for
answer to plaintiffs' petition, deny
all and singular the allegations
thereof, except in so far as they
may be hereinafter admitted, and
for turther answer allege:
"'They admit that Chas. D. Caf
fery was a candidate for mayor and
your other defendants for council
men of the town of Lafayette, La.,
at the municipal election held in
said town on the third day of May,
1897, for election by the people;
they aver that said election was
held under the provisions of act
No. x37 of x896 and on the date
fixed in the charter of said town;
that said election was held accord
"ing to law, the legal ballots counted
by the commissioners of election as
shown by their returns; that said
act 137 of x896 applies to municipal
elections; that your respondents
have received a majority of the
legal votes cast at said election and
returned elected according to law.
"Respondents further aver: That
the commissioners, the clerk and
watchers at said election were ap
pointed by the supervisors of elec
tion under the provisions of act
No. 137 of 1896; that the munici
pal authorities of the town of La
fayette had no power or authority
to appoint commissioners of elec
tion; that the power to ap
point commissioners of election
by the charter of said town is
repealed by said act x37 of 1896,
and the appointment of commis
sioners by the city council as
alleged by plaintiffs was made in
error of law and was ultra vires;
that your respondent C. D. Caf
fery, presiding at said meeting of
the council did in open and public
session state that it had no such
power and that same was now
lodged with the supervisors of elec
tion under act 137 of 1896; that
when application was made to your
respondent, C. D. Caffery, as
maybr, to call a meeting of the
Council to give plaintiffs the- ap
pointment of a commissioner, his
answer, a copy of which will show,
informed them of these facts with
the statement that their remedy was
to apply to the supervisors of elec
tion whose duty it was under the
law to make the appointment of the
officers and commissioners of elec
tion:
",Respondents further answering
aver: That the object and purpose
of the Australian system of voting
adopted in this state by act 137 of
1896 is to preserve the secrecy of
the ballot, prevent intimidation,
corruption and bribery; that at the
only previous election held under
this law in Nov. 1896 the purpose
of the law in these respects had not
and could not be carried out from
the manner and place the officers
had located the booth and box;
that the object of the authorities in
Splacing the box and booths in the
court-room of the court-house (the
polling place established by law)
was to secure a secret ballot, pre
vent intimidation, corruption and
bribery, and without any injury to
any one entitled to vote; that the
watchers appointed for both sides
and challengers were within said
court room at a distance of a few
feet and near the barriers placed
there under the law, in full view of
the whole proceedings; that no ob
jections were raised by said watch
ers or challengers to any irregula
rity, to the legal rights of any one
to vote or any unfairness in the
conduct of the election.
"Respondents further aver: That
notwithstanding all precautions
taken by the officers of the law
as above stated, they have been in
formed and verily believe, and
therefore charge, that one or more
of the leading spirits in the manage
ment of the campaign for, or some
supporter of, the People's Ticket,
voted, or caused the voting, of an
illegal ticket without the detection
of the commissioners at the time,
for the purpose of keeping the of
ficial ballot given said voter to your
respondents unknown, and then re
tired from the presence ct the com
missioners still retaining in his pos
session the official ballot provided
by said commissioner; all this con
cocted for the purpose of destroy
ing the secrecy of the ballot and to
exercise undue influnence, intimi
dation etc., contrary to the intent
and spirit of the law, by preparing
said ticket so obtained and
causing another voter, to cast it
Atnd return the official ballot ob
tained by the latter from said com
missioners, to be again used for the
same purpose; all in fraud of law
and to the great injury of your res
pondents; that thirty-five such
votes were cast against your res
pondents and in favor .of plaintiffs.
"Respondents further answering
aver: That they specially deny that
the commissioners of election pro
ceeded to count the ballots in the
absence of the watchers who had
been selected by the plaintiffs to
inspect the count of the vote; but
on the contrary, allege that said
counting of the votes was pro
ceeded with only after said
watchers had been selected, and
in the presence and under the ins
pection of every ballot by the
watchers present.
"'Respondents further answering
aver: That the provisions of act
137 of 1896 above referred to, con
cerning the manner of marking the
tickets or ballots and declaring the
ballots otherwise marked as illegal,
are mandatory; that the rejection
of such illegal ballots is made the
mandatory duty of the commis
sioners under the various provisions
of said act, and said commissioners
had no discretion in that regard;
that the ballots so rejected were re
jected by the commissioners of
election in the presence and with
the approval of the watchers se
lected to inspect the count of the
votes by plaintiffs, save in a few in
stances when the objections were
frivolous; that they have been in
formed and charge that those cast
for plaintiffs, if any, and rejected
were either marked, defaced or torn
for identification, and as such il
legal, or improperly marked so that
the intention of the voter could not
be ascertained; but that many, if
not a majority, of the ballots re
jected were cast for your respond
ents or some of them, many of
which rejected for the latter reason
should be counted, many of which
were rejected by the commissioners
by error.
"Further answering they aver:
That the officers of the election fur
nished two official stamps, one for
each booth, with which to mark the
ballot; that one of said stamps was
accidentally or intentionally broken
by some voter to your respondents
unknown; that said commissioners
being provided with those two
stamps, and desiring to allow one
voter at a time within each booth,
that the right of suffrage of all the
citizens could be exercised without
unneccessary obstacles or delay,
procured as soon as possible a pen
cil with a rubber at one end, the
rubber end to be used to mark the
ballot, and placed same in one of
the booths with instruction to the
voter how to use it; that without
this, only one voter could have en
tered within the barriers at a time,
necessitating unavoidable delay,
consuming double the time and
probably cause some voters to
forego their privilege, or loose their
right because of their inability to
reach the commissioners before the
closing of the polls; that the pencil
rubber was used indifferently by the
voters voting for plaintiffs and de
fendants, the ballots prepared with
it received by the commissioners
and counted in the official count
when not otherwise marked than
provided by law.
"That the voter Kelly voted, but
if he did not, it was due to his own
indifference, because by waiting a
few minutes he would have been
allowed to enter the other booth
which was provided with an official
stamp; that using said pencil rub
ber in the absence of the official
stamp caused no injury to plaintiffs,
nor did it deprive any one of his
right to vote, and the voice of the
people was heard.
"'Respondents further aver:
That they have been informed and
therefore charge that the object
and purpose of the officers in pro
curing two instead of only one
booth was because there is only
one voting precinct established by
law in said town of Lafayette; that
with only one precinct where the
registration showed a large increase
of voters, the time required with
only one booth night not be suffi
cient, especially with an industrious
population the most of whom could
only give but a limited time to
exercise their suffrage, to receive
all the votes, and thus some would
be deprived of this most inestima
ble prerogative; the object in view
was in favor of a full expression of
the popular will; that this arrange
ment secured the exercise of the
right of suffrage to all, caused no
injury to plaintiffs or any voter,
but on the contrary better secured
the rights of the people.
"Respondents further aver: That
they have been elected at said elec
tion by the people legally voting,
returned as such according to law
and duly commissioned and quali
fied.
"Wherefore, premises considered,
respondents respectfully pray that
plaintiffs' demand be hence rejected
with costs; and that the illegal
votes cast for said plaintiffs as
above stated be rejected and your
respondents declared duly elected
and quieted in the possession of
their offices of Mayor and Council
men respectively, at costs of plain
tiffs."

Gardner Camp of United Con
federate Veterans gave a picnic at
Beausejour Springs last Saturday.
The number of people present was
not as large as expected, but never
theless there was a fair attendance,
and all present had an enjoyable
time. Among the members of the
camp on the ground were: D. A.
Cochrane, A. Lisbony, T. A. Mc
Faddin, M. T. Martin, Faustin
Vincent, J. A. Laneuville, T. D.

The Same Trouble.
The following item from the
Opelousas Clarion will go to show
that Lafayette is not the only town
that is meeting with difficulties in
trying to secure a system of water
works and electric lights. Our
neighbors in Opelousas have already
encountered several obstacles in
their efforts to procure these much
needed improvements. The Clar
ion says:
Again there is a hitch in the
erection of our waterworks and
electric lights system. There must
be some evil spiry working against
Opelousas and her interests. This
is the second time that she actually
contracted for waterworks, and yet
it now seems that a third contract
with another party will be neces
sary.
The hitch this time is that Mr.
B. F. Rounds, the successful bidder
for the contract, has not yet ap
peared to furnish his bond although
the thirty days given him in which
to do so have expired. But this
will only cause, delay, as the people
are determined to have waterworks.
CARENCRO NEWS.
Items of Interest Gathered by The
Gazette Correspondent at
Carencro.
A new cottage is being built on
the lot facing the property of Mr.
L. Guilbeau. Mr. Theo. Gelvin,
the popular and experienced con
tractor, has charge of the brick
work.
Horse-back riding that seemed
so popular among our young peo
ple some time back, seems to have
completely died out.
Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Latiolais and
Mr. and Mrs. Felix Andrus were
visitors in Broussard last Sunday.
Mr. Frank Jeanmard returned
home last Monday after passing
several days in Breaux Bridge.
We notice that Frank's visits to the
little city of the Teche are quite
frequent lately. Business of course!
Croquet is once more becoming
quite popular in Carencro.
The long, shady lane north east
of town affords delightful driving
and is without doubt one of the
finest roads in the country. This
road was graded and improved by
Mr. Stelly who has proven himself
an expert in that line of work. He
has no superior anywhere. Taken
as a whole the sixth ward has ex
cellent roads.
Work has commenced on the
plant of the Carencro Union Gin
nery Co. The outfit will be com
pletely overhauled and improved.
Four new 7o-saw gins will replace
the smaller ones formerly used,
greatly increasing the ginning ca
pacity. The cotton storage house
will be enlarged, giving plenty
room for the seed cotton. A large
substantial shed will be built, af
fording shelter for some eighteen
wagons during bad weather.
It is rumored that several of our
young people intend organizing a
dramatic and literary club. This
is a move in the right direction and
The Gazette wishes them a full
measure of success.
Messrs. E. M. Heath, Aristide
Francez, Felix Villere and A. Gat
ipon went with the excursion party
to New Orleans Sunday last.
Miss Pearl Harmonson, a charm
ing young lady of Opelousas, spent
Sunday here among friends.
The new Council has been com
missioned and will assume control
of affairs on Saturday.
Messrs. Theo. J. Gelvin and A.
X. Lamulle paid a flying visit to
Lafayette last Sunday evening.
The Carencro Brass Band and
Social Club propose giving a dance
shortly. The proceeds of any en
tertainment they give will be de
voted to the purchase of new in
struments. The band is progress
ing nicely.
A number of ladies visited the
Sacred Heart Convent at Grand
Coteau last Thursday, it being
communion day.
Vacant lots in Carencro are gen
erally held at such exorbitant
figures that it is almost impossible
for any one to buy. This has a
retarding influence on the advance
ment of the place. Our assessor
might investigate and discover the
value of these hidden gold mines
and act accordingly.
What has become of all the base
ball.talent that existed here some
year or two ago ?
May 2 r was the tenth anniver
sary of the ordination of Rev.
Father Laforest, and was celebrated
in a delightful manner by the child

Laforest was the recipient of many
gifts, and was heartily congrattt
lated by all. ..
Superintendent C. F. Latiolais

Exhibition.
The 2ast of flay being the last r
day of the scholastic year the pu
pils of the Palette public school, un
der the direction of Prof. Robert
Broussard, gave their annual exhi- s
bition. It was a very entertaining %
performance, and gave satisfactory
evidence of the progress of the
children of this school. Prof.
Broussard had thoroughly prepared
the young ones for the occasion
and the manner in which every
thing was conducted showed]
thorough training and intelligent
instruction. At eight o'clock, the
hour fixed for the beginning, the
eighty children who attend the
school were present and a fairly
large audience had come. The
following interesting program was
well rendered:

tion Mr. Broussard, the teacher,
spoke "on the responsibilities of a
teacher and the advantages of a
primary education."
Prof. Broussard introduced Sa
perintendent Latiolais who delivered
a short address in French, urging
parents to send their children to
school. He was followed by Hon.
J. O. Broussard, director of 8th
ward, who also spoke in French.
High School Picnic.
The High School picnic on Wed- i
nesday at Chargois' Springs
is one long to be remem- 4
bered by all so fortunate as to
attend; for "Oh I what is nicer than
a bright picnic day, when hearts ,
are merry and companions are
gay."
After the many conveyances were
emptied of their precious freight,
each one spent the day in his or
her choice diversion, some in
dulged in pleasant conversation,
others promenaded the woody 1
glens and the remainder played
games of different sorts. But all
with hearty appetites gathered
around the well laden table and
enjoyed the mangygoodies there .
arrayed. Not until the twilight
shades were falling fast, di-1 any ',
one think of returning to the dusty
town. The gaily decorated wagons
and merry voices of the occupants,
bespeaking a delightful day, now
only a memory, but fortunately ai
sweet one.
THE DIXIES
Conquered - Washington's Nine
Win by Three Points.
The game of base ball played I& Sunday
eveniug at the Oak Avenue Park, between
the Washington team and the Dixies of La
fayette, was an exciting and interesting con
test from start to finish, the result being
doubtful until the last man was called out
by the umpire.
In spite of the costly errors made by the
Dixies, victory seemed to be theirs in the
ninth inning, but the score was tied only.
The tenth inning played decided the game
in favor of Washington.
Considerable excitement prevailed during
the tenth inning, the rooters and grand
stand cheering encouraging the boys to
win. The visitors, however, could not be
downed.
About 2oo people were in attendance,
among whom were a number of ladies
showing decided interest in the game. The
players and the score follow:
Washington. Latayette.

The Washington boys left in carriages
about 7:30 p. m., wearing their laurels with
grace and dignity, highly pleased with their
day's sport and the reception of the Dixies
which they declared to have been as hospit
able, enjoyable and pleasant as they could
possibly make it.
DIAMOND DOTS.
The boys hope that more ladies will be
present for the next game.
Lafayette has some real "'rooters."
The umpire's decisions were fair and
square.
Catcher Derbes of the Washingtons had
no use for the back-stop. lHe stopped all
the balls himself.
Broussard ran about a mile un'er a foul
fly and caught it, and the grand stand
cheered.
Pitcher Going of the Washingtons had
all the boys staying home for a while. He
won the game, they say, because his sweet
heart was one of the fair young ladies on the
grand stand.
The inimitable Bill Graser held first down.
likewise all the balls passing his way, ex
cept John's "'How 'tis !"
Jim Marsh played his usual fine game,
and was in it all the time.
Captain Jacobs, of the Washington nine,
is a gentlemen and a sport and made a num
ber of friends Sunday.
Washington had a mascot; Lafayette had
none; hence the defeat.
As soon as the boys get to hard practice
and team work they will becor.e champions.
The Gazette predicts it.
We regret to have to announce that the
game scheduled for Sunday, to-morrow
evening, between the Crowley club and the
Dixies, is indefinitely postponed, the Crow
ley club telephoning Thursday that they
were unable to meet the engagement. In
stead of this game however, the Dixies have
arranged to play a practice game with the
famous Pilette club to-morrow evening at
4 p. m. Admission free.
The races advertised for June 6, have
been postponed until the 4th of July and
will be announced in due time.
The Ladies' Five O'clock Tea
Club was entertained on Thursday
at the "Grove" by the Misses
Mudd. A ",bur and berry" party
was the means of whiling away a
few pleasant hours.
Many witty answers were given to
the questions propounded. The.
first prize, a silver-top straw-berry
emory bag, was tied for by Mrs.
Denbo and Miss Stella Trahan, and
finally won by the latter, the booby,
an old pine bur tied with blue
ribbon, was awarded Miss Haydee
Trahan. The "bur and berry"
scheme was furthermore carried out
in the decorations and refreshments
-the former being blooms from the
elder-berry, burs from pine and
gum trees, and clusters of black
berries, and the latter ltsciouts ber
ries, ice cream and straw-berry
wafers. Songs by Mrs. Biossat,
Miss Susic Hopkins and Mrs. F.
Mouton, were much appreciatcd
as was also an instrumental solo by
Miss S. Trahan. Nor was business
neglected, for thie club's motto is
"business before pleasure." The
next meeting will be at the home of
Judge J. G. Parkerson.
