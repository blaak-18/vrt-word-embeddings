TO THE VOTERS OF GEORGIA:
The above is a real, genuine ticket. In every respect legal and usable. All you need to do is to cut it out and vote it at your regular
polling place.
In 1904 there were thousands of men who could not vote because for some reason no tickets were to be had. This year no such con
dition need exist. We take this method to absolutely insure that every subscriber of the Jeffersonian can have a ticket in his vest pocket if
he finds none at the voting place. And for the readers who are not subscribers—we want to say, and to emphasize:
That we have thousands of tickets and a large force of people sending them out. We want each of you to ask for as many as you can
use. They will be sent, and at once.
The matter of having plenty of tickets on hand, so that our principles may be vindicated at the polls, is of the most tremendous im
portance. We can not pay for “workers.” Our party is not made up of mercenary hirelings. But every manly man who reads this is asked,
for the sake of the cause of Truth and the rights of his country, to do his part to get every man he knows to vote with us on November 3rd.
