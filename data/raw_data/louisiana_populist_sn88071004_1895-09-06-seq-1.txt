THE BANK QUESTION.
MAKE THEM RESPONSIBLE OR
CLOSE THEM UP.
Nearly all the Bosleess of the Coaflry is
Dose on a Credit lystem--Make Every
fBask Give Good Security to all of Its
Depositors.
The increased interest manifested
by the public on the bank question is
truly encouraging anal is proof that
thinking people are awakening to
living issues.
The power of bank corporations for
acquiring wealth, and the methods
employed, has been overlooked and
ignored, while other questions of far
less significance have been made sub
jects of endless contest.
Under present business methods
over ninety-four per cent of the com
mercial transactions of the country
is done with checks, drafts, or some
form of bank credit while less than
six per cent is done with cash.
All these transactionts are to a cer
tain extent influenced by the bank
power and in every case contribute
to its strength.
The secrets of banking lie in the
fact that depositors furnish the capi
for conducting the business while the
profits go to the bank.
People have generally labored un
der the mistaken idea that the bank
afforded security and was a safe place
of deposit.
Increased knowledge on this point
and attention to the evils of our pres
ent insecure method is the strongest
evidence that the public is taking a
lively interest on this issue.
Scarely an objection is offered to
the demand for government banks of
deposit, while the demand for banks
transacting a general loan and ex
change business grows greater and
greater as the subject is considered
and made a matter of discussion.
While the present system is open
to criticism for many reasons, the t
most attention is being given at pres
ent to the lack of security for de
positors.
The fact that over $26,000,000 a
year is stolen from depositors by irre- t
sponsible bankers is enough to awaken
the most stupid and arouse the most
Indolent.
The money thus stolen is invariably
taken from the people who place it in
the bank with a feeling of confidence
and generally believing that they are
secure.
Under these conditions it is netural i
that the people should seek a remedy.
Perhaps the most easily applied p
and at once elffective plan for reach- e
leg this evil is the recent proposition
of the Iowa People's party conven
tion.
The fifth plank of their platform it
Is to the point It reads: c'
*"We further demand that untU CI
such time as a government system of ft
finance can be established that all a
banking institutions, national, state,
and private, be required to give sen- it
rity to depositors for all moneys re- is
ceived for deposit"
This is clearly a matter over which ci
the various state legislatures have ci
controL ei
It is clearly a matter over which
such control may with propriety be lo

The machinery of our courts are
very elaborate in providing for the
si
enforcement of contracts and our
statute books are filled with law to
prevent impositions on the public.

h1 Bully For Watson.
in S. E Watson writes the Dallas
N-ws as follows:
I hold these truths to be self-evi
dent:
1. That under the single gold stand
ard silver money will become like pa
i- per money, redeemable In gold, the
supply of real money will be reduced
1e one-half, precisely the same as if no
silver money existed.
2. The supply of real money having
been reduced one-half, the value of
money will be doubled.
S 3. All real money, being gold, is
now owned by a few men who control
the lives, fortunes, liberties, opinions,
actions and morals of millions.
a 4. It is a wicked scheme for the
enrichment of the few through legis
lation at the expense of the many.
f .5. The acts of demonetizing silver
were passed by falsification and trick
ery, if not by bribery and corruption,
are acts of gross injustice to nine
tenths of the people, were never
sanctioned by the people and are rev
olutionary and void under our consti
tution.
6. The greed for money is a sin t
against God, which the people should d
endeavor to eradicate from the hu
man breast by making it so plentiful
that its possession will not be so de- r
sirable and its power for evil less
ened. Gold and silver alone are nol
sufficient,

At a recent political meeting in Chi- t
cago, a letter from E. V. Debi, now s
in jail was read. He says that t
to expect any change from the old a
parties is idiocy. "Both are controll
ed by the money power and both are p
equally debauched by this influence." it
He then refers to the present national d
administration as 'probably the most tI
infamous that has ever cursed tho si
country." He says that "'the Demo- e
cratic party is incapable and corrupt, u
full of false professions, detested and sa
scorned through the land, is as dead k
as a mummy and will be embalmed in ti
its own slime." He then states that p
in one regard the Republican party n
is superior to the Democratic, be- co
cause it does not hesitate to "boldly o
champion every measure calculated to ti
enlarge the power of plutocracy, while co
the Democratic makes a profession of ci
loyalty to the people to whom it turns w
traitor in the supreme hour. There w
is but one course open-to turn bold- st
ly to the People's party. It is impos- of
sible to either cleanse or reorganize ti
the old parties." ci

"MAKE US A KING TO
d JUDGE US LIKE ALL THE NA
n TIONS," SAID THE JEWS.
And the Prophet Answered Them:
"And He Will Take Your Fields and
it Your Vineyards, and Olivoyards, Even
the Best of Them."
Our nobility-imitating aristocracy
who are in the saddle, clamor ,r an
rinternational financial system. Like
the children of Israel they say
-"make us a king to judge us like all
nations." The prophet answered
them: .'And he will take your fields
and your vineyards, and your olive
yards, even the best of them." And
what else will an international system
n do but reduce the people to the same
e level of poverty wherever that money
system exists. If our money is inter
national our industries must speedily
become international. The money of
a country fixes the status of the indus
tries of that country. Make our money
International, and we make the con
dltiou of the people international as
- rapidly as the change can be brought
about. An international money will
flow to those places where the money
will buy the most merchandise or the
most labor, and poverty and low
I prices will flow back to till the vacuum
left by the money. With no impedi
ments at national lines to check its
movement an international money
will equalize everything that is in
fluenced by money within its pre
scribed bounds. An international
I money means international poverty.
international class laws, international
special privileges, an international
aristocracy of wealth and privilege.
Our aristocratic rulers have been
clamoring for an international silver
convention to adjust our silver to an
international standard, so that it can
flow from one country to another
without interruption by becoming a
commodity, and pass current as legal
tender in all countries. This step
accomplished there is nothing to do
to complete the conspiracy but abolish
the greenbacks and silver certificates,
declare gold an international money,
which it practically is already, and
delegate to national banks the sole
right of issue of paper money, said
paper money to be guaranteed by the
United States. Their bank currency
would then circulate as readily in
Europe and the British Isles as in this
country, and the clearing-house of
this great money octopus would be
shiased to London. and that branch of
the business of this country be trans
acted by cable.
A little more perfecting of their
plans and this giant conspiracy for
international money, conquest and
dominion will be accomplished, and
the navies and the arsenals will be
subverted to form a grand financial
empire and be used to maintain its
universal dominion. That the master
spirits in the conspiracy against man
kind are aiming at this consumma
tion none can doubt who will take
pains to trace their stealthy move
ments for the last three quarters of a
century. As their plans succeeded
one after another it is only natural
that their ambition for universal I
conquest should grow. In this
country the conspirators have found a
willing tools and an easy victim. Our a
whole people virtually have become I
so infatuated, grasping for dollars I
only, that they have not discovered I
that a greater grasper is following as t
closely as their shadow, and taking I
from them all they can gather. Sta
tisticians tell us that we have been
adding enormously to the wealth of $
the nation in the last third of a cen- d
tury. Where is this fabulous wealth? .
In possession of the money trust or s
financial empire of the world with the

And this is the king our people are
asking for to "judge us like all the b
nations;" and conditions rising all
around us are speaking in the lan
guage of Samuel, the prophet of old,
'-And he will take your men-servants c
and your maid-servants and your n
goodliest young men and your masses c
and put them to his work."

McCook, Neb.. Aug. 2G.--On crossing
the Missouri River running to Lincoln,
the Burlington land agents' party
found a prospect which, from an agri
cultural standpoint, could not be ex
celled. Corn is luxuriant and sturdy
and every stalk shows large-slz-d ea:rs
sticking out from it. It is so far ad
vanced that the uninitiated could be
d made to believe very readily that it is
past all harm from any source. Not.
withstanding its fine appearance, how
k ever, it is not yet out of danger of frost,
d and will not be for at least two weeks.
it A fne crop of oats has been reaped in
this section. Much of it is still in the
* shock and a good deal of it has been
stacked. It is thrashing out from
" thirty to fifty bushels to the acre and
will average about forty. The wheat
crop has all been harvested, and farm
era are now busy plowing their laid
I preparatory to putting in another crop
d of winter wheat.
Leaving Lincoln the outlook is much
less promising. Between Waverly and
Fairmont, a distance of sixty miles, is
a stretch of country which has usually
been described as the garden spot of
Nebraska. Crops have always been
abundant here, however poorly they
may have been in other parts of the
state. Last year and this year have
been the only known exceptions to this
rule. Somehow this belt has suffered
severely this year. It has rained copi
ously on all sides of it and all around
it, but the clouds refused to give it a
drop of moisture until too late to save
the corn crop. For a stretch of coun
try sixty miles long and sixty miles
t wide the corn crop is a comparative
failure. It will only run from a quarter
to half a crop, averaging as a whole
about one-third an ordinary crop.
Oats have not faired so badly. They
are thrashing out from thirty-1ive to
forty bushels an acre. Heavy rains fell
over this section at the end of last week
They came too late, however, to save
the bulk of the corn. Very much of it
is wilted beyond redemption and a good
deal of it has already been cut for fod
der. Wheat in this section is thrashing
out fifteen bushels to the acre.
8 West of Fairmont the scene again
o changes and an ocean of waving corn,
strong and luxuriant, is to be seen as
I far as the eye can reach in every direc.
tion. The crop from Hastings to the
western boundary of the state is prac
D tically made, and nothing but a killing
t frost can now blight it. It will average
not less than sixty bushels to the acre,
and very many large fields will yield
fifty bushels.
Around McCook is where the disas
I ters of last year were most severely
felt. The gains of this year have more
than made up for the losses then sus
tained. The whole section of country
looks like a veritable garden, and the
people feel buoyant beyond expression.
Winter wheat is thrashing out about
twenty bushels to the acre and the best
fields are yielding thirty bushels.
Spring wheat is running from twelve
to eighteen bushels to the acre. Oats
average from fifty to sixty bushels, the
best fields thrashing out 100 bushels.
Alfalfa is a new crop here with
which the people are delighted. All
kinds of live stock eat it with relish,
and it is proving to be fattening fodder.
The first year it yields one ton to the
acre, but after the third year it yields
three crops a year, which foot up seven
and one-half tons to the acre. It is
worth in the market $5 per ton, but to
feed cattle the results have shown it to
be worth $70 per acre. It is the coming
crop all along the the fiats of the Re
publican valley.
