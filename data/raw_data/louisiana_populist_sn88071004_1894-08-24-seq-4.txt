Thus after declaring a dividend
on the stock of 8 per cent the comln
patty had left a surplus In 1893
large enough to have warranted an
extra dividend of over 10 per cent,
and in 1892 it could have declared
an extra dividend of 8 per cent
Sabbv the 8 per cent actually divi
,ded. Ever since 1876 this compa
ny has paid dividends of from 8 to
9 1-2 per cent, and rare has been
the year in which it has not carried
a large sum to the surplus account,
which in the main has not been in

and is presumably available in

t"the free and unlimited coinage of
.silver at the ratio of 16 to 1." We
remember at the meeting of the
' INational Alliance at St. Louis e
1809, to which we -were a delegate
and member of the committee on
demands, the question of free coin
age came up in committee. A reso
lution had been sent to the Alliance
by a convention of free silver
' .t1t ied ext meetingo
e~ioelte we with others secured
a reconsideration of the vote on
the adler question, and had the
plain demand for "the free and un
limited coinage of silver" put In
its place. This plank has been in
every Alliance demands adopted
inace, and stands there at the prees
ent tiame. At Omaha the addition
- of' "t the ratio of 16 to 1" was
made to eliminate all possible mis
construetion of the term. Snec
action on the part of the Alliance
and Populist is in strong contrast
tothat ofthe two old parties. The
Inrt seeks through brevity and
plain terms to inform the people
just what their demands are, while
the second tbhslugh neless verbi
age seeks to conceal and confase
uas to the real meaning et the terms
employed. The Popualists are in
favor at free coinmage nrst, last, and
all the time, and need no watehbing

to vote. Neithfr one of the old

Profit to tle Sugar Trust.
Congressman Wilson declared
.luring the caucus on the tariff bill
that a specific duty would show
precisely what benefit the trust
would get, while it would be im
possible to determine this accur
ately urider the advalorem system.
lie said that the sugar trust, be
coming conviUced that the Senate
schedule would be adopted, had
made heavy purchases of foreign
raw sugar. Ile then made the
startling statement on the authority
of a leading i)emocratic Senator
that the trust had bought sugar to
the amount of $112,000,000 in the
foreign markets, in anticipation of
the Senate sugar schedule receiving
the approval of the President.
Unlder the Senate schedule the
trust would reap a profit ot -10,
000,000.
lie further said "the sugar trust
had the people by the throat," and
that it was now a oattle between
the people and this great monopoly.
-National Watchman.
Cotton Plant, Columbia, 8. C.:
Every reform politician in the
South agrees on the necessity of a
union with the West in national
political effort. But they all seem
to want to form a new party for
that purpose-what might be term
ed a fourth party. Now, we have
been unable to see why the thing
couldn't be done just as easy as
falling offs a log by joining the Peo
ple's party. It has our principles
--it cast over a million votes in
1892, big nest egg-it is thorough.
ly organized in every Western and
Southern State except this, and
what more could you ask I Maybe
some politicians like to work in
the lead, and that may be the rea
son for their desiring a new align
ment.
Grandma Democracy is having a
frightful time over the framing of
silver planks. In the big conven
tions the bodies which are respon-.
sible for democratic guide posts

are readily observed-"parity" cuts

A Senator who was on the floor
of the House discussing the situ

"popgun" bills by the House
would be utterly futile. Notice

them could pass the Senate; that

Considerable interest is mani.

Mr. J. P. Hadnot was in Colfax on
Thursday looking after land matters.
H. informs ua that he has lately had an
other batch of important homestead
seam decided in favor of the settlers,
via: John Crump, R. W. Robertoun, I.
I. Wethereby, Milburn Tekell, R. G.
Tekeil and Loyd T. Body. In relation to
the erreat rnumor that railroad lands in
GraMt parish have been forfeited back to
the government, Mr. Hadnot says he
has a lett from Benator Binachard, in
reply to direct inquiry on the subject,
sad there is nothing inrthe report.-Col
fax Chroniele,
We suppose that the above will
be snuleient to satisfy some, who
are still hoping that the Demo
cratic party may do something for
the peor man. These lands will
noet be taken from the railroad and
restored to the people until the
People's Party gets in power, so
we advise all such to aseist to
power that party that is "of the
people and for the people." The
above clipping is from a Democrat
to a Democrat and pullished in a
Democratic paper, therefore we
take it as good authority.
We can't help observing that the
present industrial system produces
friction, chronic strikes and perpet
ual war between eapital and labor.
This shows that it is not right.
Properly adjmnsted, the relation
between capital and labor would be
friendly instead ,of belligerent.
The present system muasbe chang
ed before there can be either peace
or prosperity.-Ex.
