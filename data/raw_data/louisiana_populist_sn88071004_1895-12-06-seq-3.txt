There was a rumor circulated
Sunday morning that the town of
St. Maurice, on Red river, had
been burned Saturday evening.
Inquiry devekped the fact that it
was simply an idle tale, and the

the burning of some one's hay
field.

was liberally patronized by the
younger generation, who were out
in full force to participate in the
gayeties as well as to make away
with the gumbo and refreshments.
We are unable to ascertain how
much was made, but have been told
that enough is on hand to pay for
the painting of the building.
The managers deserve credit for
their efforts in behalf of the school,
for the money made was badly
needed.

We. announce in this issue Mr.
SL. R. Burnside as a candidate for
Police Juror of ward 3, vice Dr.
J. M. Brown, nominated for Rep
resentative.
Mr. Burnside is a native Mis
sissippian, but has lived in this
State 14 years, the last 7 spent in
his present locatiotl. He is an en
ergetic and enterprising citizen,
having added to the material de
velopment of his commumnity by
establishin, a steam mill and gin
norv, a store, and secured the es
tablishment of the post-office of
Newton.
We l.ieve Mr. Burnside to be a
progressive and useful citizen, a
true Populist, and one of whom
ward 3 will be proud as her repre
sentative in the Police Jury.
He says he does not fear the
"Hot stove" and the "Hell and
high water" argument of the I)em
ocratic party, and we have no fear
of his election if nominated by the
Populists of that ward.

Are you in favor of repealing
the St !tue against carrying con
coaled weapons? Under the present
law the hoodlums and law breakers I
go around and knowing that the
majority of good citizens observe
the law, are bold and daring. Give
every one the right to carry a
weapon, and( things would cer
tainly change. Under existing
conditions the advantage is given
the man who disregards the law,
and he who observes it is at the
mercy of the armed hoodlum. Let
any citizen arm himself for self
protection and he is ilnuediritely
indicted and fined for taking step;
to protect himself. Hang such a
law.

Inconsistence.
Our Enterprise has been direct
ing against the Pops its batteries
of ridicule, abuse, hell and high
water editorials, "Dying out"
stories, etc., anti finally urg-s in a
special column that we Pops come
hack.
The next thing it will do, will be
to put on mourning for the poor
fellows who are dead to the De
mocracy, and write up a couple of
columns urging the remnant of
voters to stand by the boodle gang
and the machine, and point with
pride to its consistent course in
this fight.
Our deluded opponent has un
knowingly advocated almost every
thing in sight, in trying to save
the dear Democracy, and finally
resort to the weakest of pleas:
"'Cnne back," the dying cry of
a nearly defunct, make-shift of a
party.
As we are not coming back, our
neighbor should put on its war
paint, and sail into us for refusing.
Its reprtation and that of its par
ty demands that it quit pleading
the baby act, and try some other
method of recruiting its thinned
ranks. We only offer the sugges
tion. It need not pay attention
unless it wants to do so.
I will remain only about 20
days longer in your city.
