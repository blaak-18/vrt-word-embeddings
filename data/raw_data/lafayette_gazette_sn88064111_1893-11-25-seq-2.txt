we say if a place favorable to

sought after, its research would
here be rewarded.
'Climate.-The climate is mild and
equable-neither too warm or too
i.pld-to be appreciated must be en
oyed. While the sun shines hot in
dday in summer, it i always pleas
nt in the shade, the nights are
nerally cool. This is caused by
bhe gulf breeze; which doubtless
,has much to do in the sanitary con
* ition of our section. The winters,
except for a few weeks, are excep
tionally mild. As we write, on the
ý.ah"st of November, 1893, the ther
mometer registers 74 deg. in the

t Bro. Cunninghan, of the Rayne

less Rayne steps in and reaches "the

and Rayne "chasseing" around, it
Ibehooves the people of this town
to bestir themselves, else they'll get
lefts Itis passing strange that a
town, so admirably situated, with
everything in its favor, should be
so slow in moving. This town should
have at least a half dozen manufac
turing plants in successful opera
tions-the raw material is right at
our doors for that purpose.
It is admitted that capital is pre
requisite to develop our manifold
resources, but is a single step be
ing taken to induce captital to come
here ? It is about time for tie peo-.
pie to realize the fact that they have
to take up a big sized move on
themseles, get together, and let cap
ital know that it would be warmly
welcomed, and given every oppor
trinity to secure itself safely with us,
and enjoy the fruits of its investment.
WVhen this is done, this town will
soon occupy the plane thit her
situation entitles her to, one of the
richest and-most prosperous in the
State.
A DE-.. OCRA TIC TARIFP.
LAFAYETTE, La., Nov. 22, 1893.
Editor Lafayette Gazette :
As enunciative of genuine Demo
cratic doctrine, the following ex
cerpts taken from the New Orleans
States, will doubtless prove inter
esting reading at this juncture, in
asmuch as the Congress to convene
next month will revise the present
tariff law. Although lengthy, I
hope you will find space to publish
it. JACKSONIAN.
In the opinion of the States, neither Ala
bama's coal and iron nor Texas wool, nor
Louisiana sugar, nor any other commodity,
industry or clss, is estitled to government
protection.
When the bounty was under discussion
in Congress, the States, published here in
the heart of the sugar region, denounced it
as unconstitutional, undemocratic and as an
unjust and outrageous misapproprintion of
the money of the people of the United
States. * *Y *
Under MeKinleyism, the duties on wool,
iron and coal and a vast number of other ar
tides anul other articles of absolute necessity
are in a measure prohibitive, hence but limu
ited quantities are itnported into the United
States, and hence very little government rev
enue is yielded by the duties on them; ncv
ertheless, the Amnericanz producers, be.ng
thus protected against foreign competiaion.
add the amount duty, or a considerable per
centage of it, to the price, the American
consumer has to pay it, and thus is made by
this system to pay out of his small and legiti
mate ptfofits, or out of his hard earned
wages, a tax, or rather a tribute, not for the
support of the government, but to enhance
the profits and enrich anoth-r citizen of the
United States, who is no better than he is,
and who has no greater claims upon the
the government than he has.
This is Protection; this is AlcKinleyism:
this is the government taxing ten thousand
Amesican citizens for the benefit of one fav
ored individual; this is the process by which
the Republican party has for a quarter of a
century been creating a Plntocracy, making
the masses of the American people helpless
tributaries of a favored -class, making the
rich richer and the poor poorer; this is the
system the Democratic party has been fight
ing for sixty years, which its press and lead
era have denounoed as a scheme of govern
men robbery, that must and shall be des
L.iij~~

clless n limposede iap ii =" trades ':stal to
cspaticns of the people Ihi. several States.'
This sqoald be "ife tratfq,- ?nude wouldins'e
vitably lead to centrillastion. -
-But: ttea are athny articles of hipors
largely conisumed, yet produced here- 'n
limited qdauttiles, the duties on which .ne
cesariily yield a large revenue, on some
of-them revenue purely, on.,others revenue
largely, with a modicum of incidental bone
ht to thie American producers. For our pres
ent prfpose it is only necessary to mention,
as one bf the principal and most important
of these revenue duties that of sugar. "Thuas,
very little sugar being produced here, and
the conisumption heing very great, a duty of
one and a half, or two cents per ponnd
on it, did, and would again, yield to the
Federal Treasury an amount of revenue,
anywhere from forty to eighty millions
of dollars; though the sugar growers in
Louisiana, Firoida, Texas, the West and the
East, would certainly derive an incidental
benefit from it of probably -six or seven mil
lions amongst them.
Thtus-we are not exact as to the propor
tions-the sugar duty, while it would put a
dollar in the pockets of the sugar grower,
would put to or it dollars in the Treasury;
and thus the consumers of the country,
who would pay this tax, would derive, with
in a fraction, the full benefit of their taxes,
which would- go to the maintenance of the
Government.
On the other hand, the duties on iron,
coal, wool and the hundreds of other pro
tected articles, where they put a dollar in
the Federal Treasury, put twelve dollars in
the pockets of the limited class who produce
them.
Now, to sum up: The sugar tariff is a re
venue tariff, and the States advocates it as
one of the leading features of any revenue
tariff framed in accordance wit!h the pledg.-s
of the Democratic party to auolish unjust
and oppressive tauxatin; all taxatinn, in
short, except for revenue; and for this rca
son the States would advocate this dots
were it publishedi ;i Vaaoo City or in Maiucne
or Vermont.
The duties on iron, coal, wool and other
protectedl articles, trte States opposes, as
outragcoas, otnoxeiots and. oC,1-O Siiv-e, )be

t tthe revenue of Lhe ,govornicnot, they an.
nually squeeze out of the earnang., .f 1:h
American people, for the exclusive bet.etit
of a snmall class of favored plutocrats, the
enormous sum of one billion of dollars or
not less than thirteen dollars per cpita of
every man, woman and child in the Unite.!
States.
A revenue o-f sixty millions f-r-o tit.: dty
on sugar, and s.y forty millii, s i-sri the
duties on tea an-i coffel, would en.na. jest
one hundclred millions of revenue, p.in, po;
sinly, ten millions of incidental p:ate-ii in,
levied upon, and iaktn out ,tf t1. p ;.:" a
of the Amncrican people
Oa the other h-.nd, forty omi'liins o: -
enue derived by the gsvern.,unt ir-. o
duties on iron, coal an.l woei, means josm
forty millions of p:rtectio-n for the coal,
icon and wool barons, taken from the carn.
ings of the people for the cnrichetint of pri
vate individuals.

Carry the comparisons throughh tIe whole
tarriff, and it wiil he seen that the revenue
tariff the Democratic party is pledgedl to
adopt will tax the people say 400,000,000
for revenue and $tO,o7o,oo, possibly, for
Sincidental protection; while McKinlyissm
taxes the people $400o,ooo,ooo0 for revenue an]
one billion for protection. ID)oes not our \l is
sissippi contemporary recognize in t:ais tim
ple and brief statement, which caninot be
upset or refuted, a caumsus belli hbe
tweet the true Democratic parry and the Re
publican party; between the American peo
ple and the classses; between the Ameriant
consunmers and the American Robber Barons?
Nay, does not our contemporary recognize
the broa-l distinction between a tnridi for
revenue, which inclutdes sugar, tea and cof
fee, and the protective system, wn-ich in
eludes iron, coal an] wool? Does it not see
here the real cause that lies at the bottom of
the povperty and distresss of the agricultu
ral and other industrial classes ?

could not conceive how a Christian's

evince. "That is because," said a
gentleman who heard the remark,
"your instincts and a negro's ose

It is the general opinion that the
performances in Lafayette of the
Sells Brothers-shows, did not do in
justice to their pictorial paper, for
every prominent claim advertised
was carried out to the letter. In
fact there is not a poor or uninter
esting act, although some are better
than others, notably the trained
seals, a feature of itself we rth double
the price of the general admission.
The living hippopottami, and hip
podrome races, are, also, well worth
seeing, and so, in fact, are all the
numerous acts. All told, Sells
Brothgrs is first-class in every par
ticular.
If the public oficials will keep
their eyes open, they might discov
