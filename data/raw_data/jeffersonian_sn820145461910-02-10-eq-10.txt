OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
COLD IN TENNESSEE.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
again, but I hope this letter will not
find its way to the waste-basket as
my first did. We are having some
awful cold weather down here now;
the trees and ground are all frozen
over. I received the picture of Mr.
Watson’s house, and appreciated it
very much. I think the answer to
Jewel Owens’ riddle is a broom, and
the answers to Bascom House’s rid
dles are shoes and some bees. With
best wishes to Daddy Jim and The
Jeffersonians. — Beulah Coleman, Rt.
1, Harms, Tenn.
DIKES TO WORK.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes the
little Sand Mountain girl again, as I
saw my first letter in print. We
have had some snow since I wrote
my first letter. I like to write to
The Jeffersonian better than any pa
per. The Old Year has gone and the
New Year has come. I hope Mr.
Watson will be our next President.
I live in the country about ten miles
from Boaz. Papa makes the crop
and I help him in it. I like to help
mamma do the housework. My
grandma and aunt from Texas have
come to stay with us until next
spring. I will close by asking some
riddles: What is it that the more
you put in a barrel the lighter it
gets? No. 2. Has one mouth, two
ears, three legs; can’t walk, talk,
nor hear, but can think. No. 3. Goes
over water, under water and never
touches water. —Maud Scott, Rt. 6,
Boaz, Ala.
ONE MORE FROM ALABAMA.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you ad
mit a little Alabama girl into your
happy band? I am a little girl,
twelve year old. I have fair com
plexion, dark hair, blue eyes. Am
in the fifth grade at school. My
teacher is Professor Horton. I like
him very much. I thought, as I
never had written before, I would
try to write. We have a good school.
Myrtle Simpson is my deskmate. I
saw some riddles in The Jefferson
ian; will try to answer some. An
swer to Virgil Lee Wagner’s is the
fuss of the wagon. Hoping to see
my letter in print.—George Dyar,
Rt. 6, Boaz, Ala.
A BUSY MAIL ROUTE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l guess you
will be surprised to have a letter
from me. I thought I would join
your Club, as father takes your Jef
fersonian and Magazine, and I cer
tainly enjoy reading them, the chil
dren’s page especially. My father’s
daily occupation is carrying the mail.
His route is No. 1; it is twenty-five
miles long,- including four churches,
two villages, six country stores, five
school-houses, and one public mill;
has over one hundred boxes, and
serves over three hundred families.
—I remain your friend, Nanie Mae
Ivey, Avera, Ga.
WATSON THE GREATEST
PREACHER.
Dear Daddy Jim:—This is the
first time I have written. lam eight
years old. Have four brothers and
four sisters. I go to school; my
teacher’s name is Mr. W. H. Searcy.
I am in the fourth grade. Mamma
thinks Mr. Watson is the greatest
preacher in the world, if he don’t
get in the pulpit. Mamma and papa
take The Jeffersonian. My birthday
is February 23d. If I see this in
print will try again.—Della Hancock,
Rt. 2, Thomasville, Ga.
A NEW FRIEND.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
for the first time. I live in the fine
old State of Georgia. I have fair
complexion, light hair and blue eyes.
Am twelve years old. I like to go
to school; am in the fifth grade. My
teacher’s name is Cousin Sadie
Green Chastain. My papa takes Mr.
Ghe 3effersonlan
Watson’s Jeffersonian, and I like to
read the Post-Card Club. I have
eight brothers and two sisters. I
like to live on the farm. I saw in
The Jeffersonian where Virgil Lee
Wagner asked a riddle, and I think
the answer is a shadow. Papa thinks
Mr. Watson is the greatest man in
the world. I will give a riddle, and
then close for fear it will reach the
waste-basket. What is the most
bashful thing in the world? —A new
friend, Myrtis Chastain, Ochlocknee,
Ga.
A WATSON DOG.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. Guess you all have forgotten
me. After reading the letters in the
Post-Card Club I could not resist
writing any longer, so thought I
would write, this beautiful morning.
I received my post-card of Mr. Wat
son’s house, and sure do think it is
pretty. I will tell you about myself.
Have blue eyes, fair complexion, am
five feet high, and weigh 120 pounds.
So you all know I am a pretty bird.
Will let you all guess my age. I live
on a farm of eighty acres. We raise
corn, cotton, peas and potatoes of
both kinds. I go to Sunday-school
every Sunday, and sure do like it.
Suppose we quit asking riddles, and
ask questions out of the Bible:
No. 1. How old was Moses when he
died, and on what mount did he die?
Who set up the first earthly govern
ment; and when was the first Gen
tiles’ church set up, and by \vhom?
I have a brother who has a pretty
little white dog that he named after
Mr. Watson. He says he hopes it
will make as smart a dog as Mr.
Watson is a man. I also have a
brother who has part of Mr. Wat
son’s name. Wishing you all a hap
py New Year. —Your true friend,
Florence Smith, Rt. 2, Box 63, Wal
nut Grove, Ala.
ROOM FOR ONE MORE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—ls there room
in your paper for another Emanuel
county boy? I am only twleve years
old. I read The Jeffersonian and
like it fine, think it a grand paper.
Wish every boy and girl in Georgia
would read it. I see letters from
other boys and girls that say they
like to read certain pages, but I like
to read it all. I will be thirteen
years old next Sunday. I live in the
country, and like it fine. A rural
route brings our mail to our door. I
think that much better than to have
to go several miles after it. I guess
you all know who did this: Hon.
Thos. E. Watson. Hurrah for him!
I think he is the greatest man that
ever lived in our country. I went to
hear him speak at Stillmore, Ga., in
September, 1998. I will close, as
this is my first letter. —George C.
Peebles, Rt. 3, Swainsboro, Ga.
NEW COUSIN; NEW RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—This is my
first time to write to the Post-Card
Club. Igo to school and like it very
much. My teacher’s name is Miss
Holbrooks. I am in the fourth
grade. I am eleven years old, and
live in the country. I will ask a
riddle: Low as a mouse, tall as a
house, bitter as gall, and sweet after
all. To the first one answering this
riddle I will send a pretty post-card.
I have dark hair, brown eyes, and
fair complexion.—Your little friend,
Jewell Harris, Royston, Ga.
A DRY TIME.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come to
chat with you awhile. I will tell you
something about the country where
I live. I live near Holmes Creek, in
Jackson county. The country is very
hilly in some places, in others it is
level and marshy. We live where it
is hilly. There are a lot of branches,
and creeks are far between. It has
not rained very much this fall.
Nearly everybody has been hauling
water from the creek or from the ar
tesian well at Graceville. We have
been living here two years; moved
from Grady county. I think farm
lands are much better here than
there. Guess I had better skiddoo
for this time; will come again.—Sin-
cerely, Eva Hardin, Graceville, Ga.
TWO SISTERS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here come two
little Georgia girls. My papa takes
the weekly Jeffersonian and also the
Magazine. He thinks there is no
man so great as Mr. Watson, and
never fails to speak a good word for
him when he gets in a crowd. We
are sisters, the older ten years and
the younger eight. We both have
light hair and blue eyes. We go to
school every day that it is not too
cold, and we also help mamma do
the housework and the milking. We
had a good time, Christmas. Old
Santa Claus came and brought us a
lot of nice things. As this is our
first, we will close with best wishes
to The Jeffersonian. —Nevada and
Estelle Davis, Gibson, Ga.
Pain in
Heart
“For two years I had pain In
my heart, back and left side.
Could not draw a deep breath
or lie on left side, and any little
exertion would cause palpita
tion. Under advice I took
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy and
Nervine. I took about thirteen
bottles, am in better health than
I ever was, and have gained 14
pounds.”
MRS. LILLIE THOMAS,
Upper Sandusky, Ohio.
For many years Dr. Miles’
Heart Remedy has been very
successful in the treatment of
heart troubles, because of its
tonic effect upon the heart
nerves and muscles. Even in
severe cases of long standing it
has frequently prolonged life for
many years after doctors had
given up all hope, as proven by
thousands of letters we have re
ceived from grateful people.
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy Is sold by ail
druggists. If the first bottle fails to
benefit, your druggist will return your
money.
