what sincere tariff reformers desfted
or What the fledoctatic masses had
a right to expect, it is a step in the
directloft of that reform which the
people demanded when they placed
the present administtattou in power.
Owing to the tretchery of an un'
scrupulous few in the higher branch
of Congress that reform so earnestly
asked by the people, and so solemn
ly promised by the party leaders,
has been only partly'carried out.
While the bill is not what it
should be, and while it has
been bitterly denounced by the
radical reformers, the more conserv
ative of the 'patty at Washington,
have shown clearly that it is much
preferable tbanthe present McKinley
law. The Democratic leaders in
the House admit that the bill is far
from satisfactory, but being con
fronted with the condition of '-Sen
ate bill, or no bill," they wisely came
to the conclusion that it was better
to accept *"half a loaf than no loaf
at all."
Owing to the influence of the
coal and iron combines and of the
sugar trust, products of Republican
class legislation, the true Democrats
in Congress wed prevented from
carrying out their pledges, and they,
were compelled to accept the terms
of these powerful monopolies, or
else, totally fail to give the people
any relief from the ruinous taxes of
the obnotious McKinley bill.
The sugar trust, one of the off
springs of Republican legislation,
will be deprived of one half of the
protection accorded it under the
McKinley law. The 75 cents duty
on coal has been reduced to 40
cents. It gives free wool, free lum
ber, free hemp and jute, free bag
ging, free binder's twine, makes a
reduction of over o50 per cent, on
woolen goods, the same on cotton
goods, 46 per cent. on iron ore, and
generally throughout the sehedule.
The bill gives too much protection
to the trusts and combines, but a
reduction has been made, and that
is the best that could be done under
the circumstances.
Our own State has fared well, and
let us be thankful to our able sena
tors for what we did get. It could
have been much worse. It is not
thought that the separate free sugar
bill will pass the senate. It was
passed on the part of the House
to emphasize its position against the
impudent interference of, and cor
rupt means employed by, the sugar
trust.
BACK TO THFE FARMiS.
There is a growing tendency on
the parc of young men to abandon
the farm for the city. Idleness
which prevails in cities may be
traced to the large number of peo
ple who prefer to remain in the city
out of work than to lead the peace
ful life of the farmer. There is an
abundance of tillable land in this
country which can be purchased for
very reasonable prices. The life of
the farmer may not be the easiest
in the world, but all who have
tried both city and country life will
readily acquiesce in the statement
that it will compare very well with
that of the stoker, clerk, or me
chanic. The farmer may not al
ways possess ready cash, but he is
always sure of employment and
living at least, which cannot be
truthfully said for the other trades
at the present time. It is true the
city man enjoys luxuries which are
denied to the farmer,but are not the
surroundings ofthe farm house health
ier and more natural than those of
the city home.
There are more people making a
living out of agriculture than any
other business. The farmer of
this country, unlike his European
brother, is a skilled artisan, the
backbone of the nation. The city
and tradesman who are tired
--e everish existence of the city
should return to the farm. There
bsy will find contentment and pros
perity.

Several of the railroads operating in Geor

states and particularly in Louisiana.;-Crow

One of the good laws enacted by the last
legislature is that authorizing police juries to
hire ouat or work on the public roads the
convicts sentenced to pay a fine or to im
prisonment in the parish jail. There are
some people in every community who are
too lazy to work, and in tider to live with
out manual labor commit some petty offense
in order to be sent to jail.-lberville Seuth.
The city dailies and country weeklies
either through ignarance or spite have been
for months (to our mind) engaged in unjust
attacks on the legislature. The people
should remember that there are two sides to
all questions and that it appears tq be the
mission of a majority of the newspapers of
this State to look on the darkest side of every
question and to impugn the motives of every
public gan. The experitnce of the past
three years taught the people how much
weight is to be attached to newspaper attacks
on public men, and we predict that when
they have been made acquainted with the
acts and work of the last legislature shey will
be satisfied with their work.-Amite City

As yet no steps have been taken for the
ihauguration of the campaign iU this Con

hoped that matters may be permitted to
remain in statu quo for some weeks yet. We
all want a short campaign. The people will
be too busy and too much absorbed with
their business affairs to give much attention
to politics. We have had enough of political
agitatation in the past to cause us to wish to
put off a campaign as long as possible.

SUGAR IN DANGER.
N. O. States.
Immediately after the passage of
the Senate bill by the House yes
terday separate bills putting coal,
iron ore and sugar on the free list
were taken up and passed. All the
Democrats with the exception of
about twenty voted for free coal
and iron, but the free sugar bill
only had eleven votes recorded
against it, and the number included
the votes of the six Louisiana rep
resentatives. There is every reason
to believe that the free coal and tron
bills by reason of the opposition of
the Gorman coterie will be promptly
I igeon holed as soon as they reach
the Senate, but there Is great dan
ger of the free sugar bill becoming
a law if it is reported to the Senate,
because both of the political parties
Sare anxious to go on record as hos
tile to the Sugar Trust, and enough
Democratic and Republican Senators
will vote together to put sugar on
the free list by a large najority.
Senator Palmer expresses the opin
tion hat the bill will pass before the
end of the present session, but there
are others who think differently. It
ris safe to say that the two Louisiana
i Senators will do their utmost to
Sprevent the bill being reported by
:the finance committee of the Senate,
and as a matter of course the Sugar
Trust will actively oppose any
action by the committee, for the re
