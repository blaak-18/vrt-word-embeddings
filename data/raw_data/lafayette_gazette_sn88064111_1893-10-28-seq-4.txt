though somewhat removed from the
central portion of the grounds this
building is at all times thronged with
visitors who seem loth to leave the de
cayed remnants of former members of
early tribes of this country and the
moldy skulls of human beings who once
lived and moved and had their being in
all quarters of the globe.
There seems to be a sort of fascina
tion in these repulsive relies. The aver
age person will stand and gaze into the
sightless' sockets of a grinning skull
with as much interest as he will view s
beautiful picture or a wonderful mech
anism. Of course there are exceptions.
Some people-and they are not only the
timid, nervous women, either-steer
clear of these exhibits and glance
askance at them if they unintentionally
happen upon them.
One day recently a party of men were
strolling about among the mummies
when one of them, a big, rough-look
ing fellow, turned away from the sight
with an expression of mingled awe and
disgust, and expectorating with some
force, exclaimed: "Say, fellers, this is
too dang much for me! Them things

WVith a laugh the others followed the

in miniature, of course, but they are so
carefully modeled after the originals
that they afford an accurate study of
the building methods of a historic race.
Five models of as many famous
pueblos of Arizona and New Mexico
occupy space in the main corridor of
the building. The stone and adobe
dwellings of the sedentary tribes
which of all the Indians reached the
hielhest mark of civilization are shown
as they stand to-day. These sedentary
tribes. so called in distinction from the
noumadic tribes, lived in that part of
the continent which is now included
by the territories of New Mexico and
Arizona. The very fact of the situa
tion of the pueblos signifies a great
deal to a student of ethnology. The
advancement of the savage to a
state where a tribe lived together all
the time within the walls of a city and
could be found at home at any time by
a band of hostile Indians is in a
measure accounted for by the prox
Imity to the domains of the great
Aztecs. The range of the civilization
of the ancient inhabitants of Mexico
was as far reaching as it was potent.
One of the most remarkable of the
pueblos is that of Bonito in the canyon
fl
KEYBOAIRD OF THE CEIM S.
of Chaco in New Mexico. This home of
the Indian was built in the shape of a
half circle and faced out on a yawning
chasm. The high walls of the houses
facing to the rear served the double
purpose of a fortification against
enemies and a protection against the
elements. The buildings were all of
stone and the masonry of the tribe,
judged by the ruins of the towns that
are left, was really marvelous. Their
tools were much better than those of
the other tribes of the time and the
people more peaceful and industrious.

all conected with one spot, though
running off in strings in five directions.
It is uninhabited to-day and still
remains as it stood untold centuries
ago.
A novel feature of the daily pro
gramme £ the fair is the playing of the
chime bells in the tower of Machinery
hall. Visitors from the country who
have never seen the operation of a
chime of bells are at a loss to under
stand how it is done. Some very
naturally suppose that it is done by
simply pounding upon the bells with a
hammer, but then again that seems a
little improbable when they hear some
of their favorite tunes played and with
such correctness as they are exeenuted.
A visit to the east gallery of the hall
will enlighten the uninitiated on chime'
ringing.
There the operator is at work. At
first sight it would seem that he was
engaged in running a double-geared
combination pumping apparatus or in
a spirited contest of human endurance
against machinery, but a few moments'
observation will reveal the fact that he
is engaged in playing the tune which
at the moment is rolling through the
corridors of the grand Court of Honor.
Prof. C. E. Bredberg isthe operatorof
the chimes at the fair and he manipu
lates the handles of the keyboard in a
masterly manner. Through his skill
the ears of the tired sightseer
who sits upon the base of some statue,
or any other base that will afford him
a moment's rest, are delighted with
some old-time melody as it goes ring
ing across the domes of the beautiful
city of white.
At stated intervals during the day
Prof. Bredberg opens his music book to
a familiar tune and places it before
him on his chiming stand. Then he
commences a series of gymnastics that
give him muscles like a blacksmith's.
It is not nearly so easy as it looks to
the knot of visitors that always gathers
around the railing when the professor
begins. He dances up and down the
line of handles, at times using one
hand and at others both. When he
grasps a handle he gives it a vigorous
push downward, and without an in
stant's hesitation goes on to the next.
It is the big bells that have hardened
Prof. Bredberg's biceps. It is no trick
at all to ring the little ones, but the
deep-toned monsters with heavy clap
pers are harder. To ring them an
amount of strength such as the ordinary
man does not possess must be put into
the stroke. There must be a certain
amount of delicacy in each stroke, too,
for any discord, however slight it
might be in an ordinary instrument,
produces a grating jar when it appears
in a chime. Prof. Bredberg is too old
at the business to make any mistakes
now, and when he pushes a handle he
is certain that it is the right one. Iis
practiced ear catches the sound from
the tower high above him even when
the machinery hums its loudest. If
anybody wants to know whether or not
the professor earns his salary let him
try to pump ten church organs at once
and he will have some idea of it.
The chime now on exhibition is com
posed of ten bells in the major scale of
D, and includes the flat seventh note.
They grade in weight from D, the
heaviest weighing 3,190 pounds, to E,
the smallest one in the collection. 330
pounds. The aggregate weight is 11,
820 pounds. exclusive of the attach
ments, or with all the attachments
about 16,000 pounds. The bells rest on
a heavy oak frame with the big bell on
top and the smaller ones beneath it.
They were taken up to the tower sepa
rately and hung in place without hav
ing been tested in any manner before
leaving the factory. The tongues of
the bells are connected by means of
wires, straps and pulleys to the levers
of the chiming stand one hundred feet
below.
The subject of salvage on the fair
buildings is already under discussion.
In a few weeks more steps will be
taken to dispose of the material of
which the great buildings are com
posed. Much of it will of necessity
be wasted, but there will be a great
deal of it that can be utilized for build
ing purposes. A great deal of the
timber will be just as good as new and
will doubtless go at half price or less,
and it is quite likely that a great de
mand will arise for it to be used in the
construction of dwellings near the
grounds.
There will undoubtedly be a use
found for much of the iroa and steel
used in the construction of the fair
buildings and there will 14' plenty of
chances for junk men to get on a profit
able deal in refuse. As there is nearly
two months left in which to discuss
this matter it does not at present com
mand much attention, but it will soon
become a question upon which the fair
officials will be engaged in good earnest.
- It's a DViver."'
It was in the Italian section of the
Liberal Arts building, and I was look
ing at a fine piece of armor well set up
helmet and vizor, breastplate, greaves,
etc.-when a woman's voice behind me
exclaimed: "It's a diver. I've seen 'em.
Ain't he natural looking!" They were
evidently an elderly country couple
and she had just caught sight of the
armor. I wondered what the smith
who had wrought with such patient
art would have said could he have
heard the exclamation, and have seen
the couple walk on perfectly satisfied
that they had seen a diver, the husband
delighted with his wife's knowledge.
The very resemblance which made the
mistake not altogether inexcusable
made it all the funnier. Doubtless
amusing mistakes like this have counted
up into the millions at the fair, yet in
spite of these it has not failed in Its
function as an educator.-Centurv.
AGRICULTURAL HINTS
ARTESIAN DRAINAGE.
W I th o u t T h o ro u g e ss th e W or~ k (taUL o
So Mmda a Seueess.
I learned something about drainage
last year which has been of great serv
ice to me this spring, and may be to
others who have a similar problem to
solve. The drainage of springy land is
often very difficult. The ditches put
through the wet place are found to
drain only imperfectly the surrounding
soil I have seen water stand on the
surface of the ground with tile buried
three feet below-all clear and free and
in good working order. The reason is
the water is forced out of the ground
by an upward pressure, and comes
through little seams and veins distrib
uted through the soil, many of them
near the tile perhaps; yet the water will
come nearly or qdtte to the surface be
fore it works its way to the tile. The
condition producing this state of affairs
is illustrated in the cut. A shows 'p
per stratum of wet soil, which is urten
peaty or mucky; B is a layerof hardpan
or tough be vlder cla y or marly clay; C
shows the gravel water-bearing strat
um; D E i' are the minute natural
water channels from latter to surface.
The tile is generally laid directly on
the hardpan, as shown at G. If condi
tions are favorable, this will dry it
sometimes. To cut deeper into the
hardpan is useless unless you can go
clear through, and this is often impos
sible. I have done it, however, with
the very best results. Last year I took
up a tile ditch which had failed to
benefit the ground, and by sinking it a
foot or two deeper struck the loose
gravel, and drew the water out from
under all the surrounding region.
But to go clear through the hardpan
is often too expensive and even impos
sible. I have cured very difficult places
by taking a post-hole digger and sink
ing a small hole through the hardpan
down to the water-bearing gravel, as
shown below G in the cut. The water
will generally rush up and flow off
through the tile. This should be done
at intervals of about a rod. One ditch
in which I worked this spring was par
ticularly difficult. The banks caved and
slipped in together so that part of them
had to be shoveled out twice. Then
when I tried to bore down through the
hardpan it was a very tedious job. I
got down about three feet and every
thing as dry as could be, and was dis
couraged and about to give up when I
saw the gleam of water, and with
another effort passed clear through the
hardpan into the gravel. The wate
rose sorprisingly fast, and flowed out
in a volume that half filled a four-inch
tile. As soon almost as this stream
started other small streams that were
coining up by the side of the ditch
ceased to run, and now it is all as dry
there as can be desired, although it
would have mired a duck before we be
gun.
Thoroughness in tile draining is es
sential. Bletter not attempt than to
try and half succeed.-J. i. Wing, in
Country Gentleman.
POULTRY PICKINGS.
J!AIMA eggs are said to be darkest
in color when the pullets commence
laying late in the fall.
SOIE of the most successful poultry
men sell the early hatched roosters for
broilers and keep the pullets for layers.
THER.E is no economy in having the
poultry so wild that they annot be
handled readily at any time that it may
be necessary.
A nDucK acts like it wad always hun
gry and fo, this reason it is an easy
matter to overfeed, and there is noth
ing gained by having them too fat.
IT is a good time now to feed and fat
ten the old hens for market. This can
be done better now than later. There
is no gain in keeping them any longer
than is strictly necessary.
Fi.LTr from allowing the droppings
to accumulate is. perhaps, the most di
rect cause of disease. There should be
a regular time for cleaning up and it
should be strictly adhered to.
WVIILE for some reason it may be a
good plan to bury fowls that die with
contagious disease, the safest plan is to
burn as soon as possible. This destroys
all chance of spreading a disease by
contagion.
TVHEN the hens have a good range
they are able to pick up various kinds
of food and so have a supply of all the
elements that go to make up the eggs
that they produce, but when contined
this variety must be supplied.
As sooN as the weather begins to get
cool a safe rule in feeding, especially
with the laying hens, is to give a warm
feed in the morning and whole corn at
night, giving the latter just before the
fowls fly up on the roosts.-St. Louis
Republic.
RKeeping Fruit Withount nSugar.
Writing from Grayson, La., a corre
spondent asks how to keep fruit with
out using sugar. Cook the fruit in a
porcelain lined vessel or a bright tin
one; and cook it by placing the vessel
containing the fruit in another tin ves
sel set on the stove and containing
enough water to nearly reach the top
of the vessel containing the fruit. Keep
the latter vessel closely covered. Fill
the fruit jars with the fruit and seal
them while the fruit is boiling hot.
The fruit can be placed in the tin cans
and these placed in the water. After
sealing stand them in cold water. If it
Is desired to can fruit so that it will
look exactly natural the fruit used
must be only half ripe.-Farmers'
Voice.
Starvlng His family.
The man who employs a farmhand
simply because he can be had cheaper
than a better man saves in the wages,
perhaps, but generally pays double in
the loss of efficiency. The man who
deprives his family and himself of good
Ireading, saves the cost of the books at
Ithe fearful price of mental starvation.
The man who stints his wife in help for
her work saves the wages of a domes
tic by the slow murder of her he has
sworn to cherish. The man, whether
on farm or elsewhere, that forgets that
the means in his hands were given him
by God to be used aright, and imagines
he is under no responsibility for their
use, will haveea fesrful account to give
hereafter. -Rural World.
DISASTROUS DISEASE.
The latur sad Proper Treatment Ia
evpesm ir Nowl.
This disease often destroys whole
broods of young chicks. It is caused by
threadlike reddish worms that live in
the throat or windpipe of the poultry.
These cling to the walls, sucking the
blood of the parts. One worm will pro
duce 2,000 to 8,000 eggs. The hatching
of the egg oceurs only when it is kept
constantly moist and at a temperature
of about 68 degrees Fahrenheit. If the
tem ture is below 60 degrees the
eggs not hatch, but will ret}in
their ~i ity for a year or more, pro
vided they are kept moist. When the
affected fowls gape and choke for
breath some of the worms are ejected
into the water troughs where the fowls
frequently congregate, evidently try
ing to allay the inflammation in the
windpipe by drinking copiously. The
ejected worms or eggs are greedily
taken by other fowls present or the
water containing them is drunk, thus
spreading the disease and in large
flocks producing a veritable epidemic
The best remedy is prevention.
Keeping fowrls on dry permeable
soiL Feed generously, including
chopped onions or garlic occasion
ally. Wash out the water trough or
pan daily with boiling water. If gapes
is present among the fowls, separate
the sick ones, add to each quart of
drinking water four fluid ounces of a
solution of salicylic acid, made ty dis
solving sixteen grains of the dry acid
in four fluid ounces of clear boiled rain
water. The pen in which the sick
fowls are kept should be as dry as pos
sible, and the ground should be sprin
kled twice daily with water, to each
quart of which add four fluid ounces of
commercial sulphuric acid. Where only
a few fowls are affected a bit of cam
phor about the size of a grain of wheat
may be forced down the throat of each
and will by its odor kill the wormis.
One drop of turpentine dropped into
the throats has given good results,
Powdered asafetida, ten grains per
head, may be fed in a mash of corn
meal Chopped garlic or strong smell
ing onions will also be found beneficia'.
Turpentine rubbed on the outside of
the throat will sometimes cause t'le
worms to let go their hold. The use of
a small feather or hair loop, dipped in
turpentine and thrust down the wind
pipe of the sick fowl, is often effective.
The worms may either be withdrawn
or else coughed out by the chick.--Gr
aid McCarthy, in Farm and Home.
VENTILATION OF HIVES.
How to Keep the bees in Good Condition
in Winter. *
Bees like other living creatures must
have'fresh air, the right temperature. a
right degree of dryness and such foods
as nature has provided for them to per
petuate the numerical strength of the
hive and to keep them in good working
order. A writer in the American liee
Journal says: It is instructive to read
and ponder on the various opinions of
bee-keepers on different topics pertain
ing to the business. I would like to
call attention to the matter of ventila
tion in winter. Some advocate bottom,
some top, and others think because the
bees in their natural state close up all
crevices with propolis that ventilation
is not necessary. I recollect a few
years ago a friend of mine got a
colony of bees on shares. The box was
about eighteen inches high, and about
twelve by twelve in other dimensions.
This box was placed on blocks of wood
about one and a half inches high. from
the bench on which it was placed, and
there it stood in summer and winter, in
the same condition for about ten or
twelve years, the colony always being
among the first to swarm in the spring.
Some seven or eight years ago this
same man had three top swarms come
off at the same time, and cluster to
gether. and nothing but a log-house or
log-barn to hive them in, but he
thought of an old salt barrel, which
he got, and, placing sticks across it, lie
hived the bees in it. They filled the
barrel about two-thirds full the first
season, and the next season filled it up.
The following spring a neighbor bought
it, paying twelve dollars for it, and I
helped him remove it. There were sev
eral cracks in the barrel that a man
could run his finger in, and we had to
do it up in cloths to keep the bees in.
In both of the above cases the bees
wintered nicely. I noticed the past
winter the older and more open my
hives were the fewer bees died, and as
a rule are better than most of those in
close hives.
HANDY FEEDING COOP.
How to Prevent the lHens fromn Eating
the ChIcks' ltations.
As the chickens begin to be fed out
side the coop, the old fowls are apt to
be on hand and take up all the choicest
bits before the youngsters can get
them. To get around this difticuly I
take some 1 by 2 inch pieces and make
a frame 2 feet high and 4 feet squarte
On this I nail strips crosswise. so the
coop when finished looks like the ac
companying illustration. This style of
a feeding coop is much preferable to
the ones made with slats running up
and down, as the chicks cannot get
caught in the spaces. When the chicks
become too large to pass through the
spaces readily, posts can be nailed to
the corners to raise the coop off the
ground, allowing the chicks to run un
der the bottom slat. Many of the scri
ous deformities found among chickens
comen from their squeezing between
pickets and through the meshes of
coarse wire netting. When feeding at
an early age this may be prevented by
some such feeding device as this one.
F. E. Dawley, in Farm and Home.
Wages Paid tor Farm Labor.
Secretary Rusk made an interesting
contribution to the industrial statistics
of the country in his published report
on the wages of farm labor in the
United States. His tables show that
in 1868 monthly farm wages, exclusive
of board, were as follows: In eastern
states, 683.81; middle states, $20.83;
southern states, 616.63; western states,
625.84; mountain states, 62T.23; Pacific
states, 843.60, the average being 026.67.
The lowest point was reached in 1879,
when the average was 61G.03. From that
time, howeve, they have steadily in
creased until at the present time they
are: In eastern states, 62.46; middle
states, s22.23; southern states, 614.88;
western, ~2'.01; mountain, $22.01; )Pa
cific, 688.16; the average per ;r onfte ir
the whole year being 616.50.
