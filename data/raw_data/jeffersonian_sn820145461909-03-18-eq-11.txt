ers, free of interest, and lend it to
the borrowers at usury. This, also,
seems incredible, but it is so. The
borrowing class pay most of the Fed
eral taxes; the National bankers pay
practically none of it; and the Gov
ernment hands over many millions of
its money to the bankers who, in turn,
lend it to the men who paid the taxes.
In other words, a considerable por
tion of the capital loaned by the Na
tional banks is first taxed out of the
men who borrow it from the bankers.
Fine system, isn’t it? The volume
of National bank notes now outstand
ing is nearly seven hundred million
dollars.
That enormous sum is practically a
free gift that you, through the two
old parties, have made to the money
sharks.
You give it to them, virtually for
nothing, and then you mortgage your
property, your liberty, and the future
of yourself and family, for the pre
cious privilege of borrowing a part of
what you gave to the bankers.
And yet you marvel at breadlines,
hard times, and wide-spread misery.
FREE SUGAR.
Thomson, Ga., March 8, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson,
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Dear Sir: We enclose you circular
that we have been getting out of every
barrel of sugar that we have recently
bought. Please let us know in the
next week’s Jeffersonian the meaning
of this circular.
Yours very truly,
(per H.)
The following is a copy of the cir
cular mentioned:
Notice.
With no duty on sugar, this sugar
would be two cents per pound cheaper.
Write your senator and congressman
that you favor “free sifgar.”
Answer: The tariff on sugar enables
the Sugar Trust to charge the Ameri
can consumer the normal price of
sugar plus the amount of the duty.
Suppose the foreigner is compelled to
pay at the custom house, a tariff duty
of 50 per cent. When he offers this
imported sugar for sale in the Ameri
can market he must add that 50 per
cent duty to the selling price, just
as a tobacco dealer has to add in the
Internal Revenue tax when he retails
cigars and ping tobacco.
The fact that the foreigner has to
add 50 per cent to his selling price
enables the Sugar Trust to add about
as much to what would be its price
were there no tariff duty to pay.
If sugar is put upon the Free list,
the foreigner can enter our markets
on equal terms with the Sugar Trust.
He will not HAVE to add 50 per cent
to his price, and the Trust will not be
able to do s>o.
LIFE BEYOND.
Os the life beyond—not a thing,—
But like a rosebud’s dream of spring,
A chrysalis, whose uncouth form
Melts to beauty, as the days grow
warm.
Os such is life, —here we see
Naught of beauty, but misery;
Yet, when the Soul unfolds its wings,
We dream of Life, and brighter
things.
J. THOMAS WRIGHT,

AN OLD SOUTHERN HOMS.
’Twas a glorious day in autumn,
And the sun was sinking low,
Yea, its rays, bright and golden,
Gave the sky a mellow glow.
Darkies from the fields returning
Sang the songs of long ago,
Coming to receive their earnings
From the large plantation store.
From their huts directly upward
Floated hazy lines of smoke,
While a faint delicious odor
Healthy appetites awoke.
Home they went with bundles laden,
From the large plantation store,
And a wholesome meal awaiting
Made their humble spirits soar.
t
In the soft and mellow moonlight,
And in front the cabin door,
Floated softly strains of musie,
Strains which mow are heard mo
more.
Near their huts a stately mansion,
’Neath the tall and spreading trees,
Formed the honest master’s residence,
Where the slaves their wants ap
peased.
Ah! a healthy, happy family,
Gifted, cultured and refined,
Graced the old palatial mansion,
Which the years have left behind.
J. F. Bloodworth.

WHAT IS THERE IN IT FOR ME?
A letter written to a man for some
information which would have cost
him not a moment’s time was return
ed with the endorsement: “What is
there in it for me?” It was not in
human nature to resist such an op
portunity to relieve our mind, and
here is the reply:
All right, little man, live up to that
doctrine and you will get it, but that
is all you will get. When you have
finished your course, you may leave
an estate, but you will leave nothing
else; no mourning friends will weep
over your bier, your community will
feel no sense of affliction in your de
parture, no recipients of your good
offices will feel that they have lost a
friend and brother, no human being
will be able to say that he has been
helped upward and onward by you,
but all that is nothing to you if you
can only get money. And it is men
like you, little men, that are doing
great damage to the best interests of
the country. Men who go through
life with the eold-blooded, selfish de
termination that every move must
have “something in it for them,” us
ually get their desires, and at the end
of the journey will have the certain
knowledge that they have not paid
their footing to the community, and
that their lives will be charged up to
the debit side in the great general led
ger of humanity.
“What is there in it for you?”
Much, little man, if you had a heart
that felt right, and eyes that saw
straight, and ears that eaught the
truth, but without these things there
is nothing in this world for you but
swill. —The Greater Atlantian.
