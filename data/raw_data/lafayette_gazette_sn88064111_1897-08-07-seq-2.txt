SATUr DAY, AUGUST 7, 1897
Emma Beaubian walked from St.
Louis to :New York to meet her
lover in order that they might get
married. That is love. ,
A Republican contemporary says
that the advance agent of pros
perity has reported. We are
tempted to ask where in the devil
has he registered.
The refusal Of Senator McEnery
to be interviewed by a States re
porter and his willingness to be in
terviewed by a representative of
O'Malley's Item will hardly add to
his popularity among the Demo
crats of Louisiana.
It is with a sigh of relief that
Democrats throughout the country
will learn that the New York Sun
has gone over to the Republicans.
The Sun has been in the service of
the money power all its life and it
had no right to call itself a Demo
cratic paper.
Col. Fred Grant has resigned as
a member of the New York police
commission because he would not
acquiesce in certain questionable
methods employed to obtain evi
den~e--gainst women of evil ways.
Col. Grant isevidently not in sym
pathy with the insidious itmn
used by the police of Gotham.
It may be unkind to refer to it,
but it is nevertheless a fact that as
soon as the Hon. C. C. Duson
withdrew his endorsement from
Capt. Wimberley, the president
made up his mind to appoint this
gdbtleman collector of the port.
Somue people seem to think that
D'nion's withdrawal was the result
of a ptevioud understanding.
The Breaux Bridge Valley sug
gests a novel plan to strengthen the
Democratic party in St. Martin
parish. It advocates a white pri
mary in which men of all parties
would be invited to participate.
This is a splendid way to break up
the party. Democratic primaries
should be for the Democrats. The
Valley's scheme won't do.
We acknowledge the receipt of
valuable copies o the Congres
sional Report from Hon. Robt.
Broussard.
NOT CON.ISTE'NT.
The Gazette has already com
mented upon the consistency or
rather the lack of consistency of
the papers engaged in Senator Mc
Enery's defense. The vigorous
and able Carrollton News is one of
those journals. Its inconsistency
is clearly shown by;the following
editorial expressions. The News
unmercifully arraigns the Republi
can policy of protection and then
in the next column tells its readers
what a great thing Senator Mc
Enery did when he voted for the
Dingley bill.
The News Said:
Everj senator was using his best efforts to
secure for the industries of his State a slice
of the watermelon-the larger the better
and with his accustomed political perception
realized that if Louisiana sugar and Louis
iana rice was not worth playmig for nothing
was. Anu the result is something like
ooo,ooo annualily or S.zS5 a year for every
citisenof New Orleans. While we are de
lighted to see that we have sl.S in 3ight
an amount that will give us an opportunity
to smoke so cent packages of cigarettes and
other things at advance prices-we congra
tulate Senator McEnery and at the same
time suggest that he does not give a contin
aental cent for the onslaught make on his
democracy, for he is the patriot who can
sink the narrow lines created by political
parties just for chicanery and trickery, and
secure the best for people and State
And then makes the following in
coherent utterance:
High tariff and low tariff, bimetallism or a
gold standard, may cause industrial distur
baace and depression as the country is made
to shift from one to the other, but the coun
try can in time adjust itself to the situation
which results merely from a political policy.
But the happiness and prosperity of the peo
ple can never be adjusted to greed and sel
hmness which seek to turn the advantages
of trade to the benefit of the few by arbi
Strary interference with the natural law of
sppo1 and demand.
The News sees no ray of hope from the
McKinley administration. He and his ad
visers are the servants of trusts and: Opor
atlons. We are ruled by a plautocit oli
archy which knows no mercy, has o sym
pathy yith euffering humanity and seeks for
sothlub t to accumulate the "almighty dol
lar" It the hands of the few as quickly as
l,-Pg lib That oliguarchy has more power
dvet tsUiqsaeople nt this country than is poe
by asy despot over his subjects.
e the-- ollar de~
of Xentamcky. where ld ri. of both
tsides are' making seattmients of ea
'.tremists; when everyjhere intestine,
warfare is disuniting aid dism em
bering that organization. No con
sesyative man can deny that the
r propects of the party are ti-deed
t dark, since dissensions are so, fre
quent; and the most optimistic
cannot see the way to bridge the
differences and bickerings of the
party. Broad-minded statesmen
have tried in vain to smooth over
difficulties, but all indications point
to another disorganized and prob
r ably ineffectual campaign in a goo.
- But amid all this doubt and hope
- lessness, the Democrats of Mary
I land,, in convention met, have
> adopted, without a dissenting vote,
- a platform which bids fair to be
come a happy model to her sister
t States, and which comes like a
r gleam of hope. They approached
I one another in a conciliating and
patriotic spirit and each -faction
t conceded to the other a part of the
t bone of contention which had so
long kept them in different paths,
and they have furnished us with a
glorious example of patriotism and
s sacrifice, worthy of the emulation
t of future State conventions.
t The convention declared for
a honest money, the gold and silver
money of the constitution, and
noted with satisfaction that the ac
- tion of six and a half million Dem
ocratic voters had compelled the
president to appoint a monetary
, commission to urge an interns:
a tional conference in favor of bimet
a allism.
a Instead of the party dissensions
t of Kentucky, it is a satisfaction and
s relief to see the broad-mmined -and
wise action of the Marylanders,
t who, actuated by a sense of duty
t to the party, and knowing
that -,it would pave the way for
final success and glory in 900oo,
took the initiative in the movement
for reconciliation and harmony.
They well knew the fatal conse
* quences of a disorganized campaign,
for last fall, they were the chief
losers, and Othey are profiting by
that experience. How much
grander and nobler is this harmony
in the Democratic ranks of Mary
land, than the factional fight in
Kentucay.
Democratic principles are too
dear and its history too sacred to
divide on the first and blemish the
latter, because all its members do
not agree on one question; its ac
complishments too noble and its
promises too much in sympathy
with the toiling masses, the man
hood, the bone and sinew of the
land, to jeopardize its success because
of one difference; it is too- closely
united with the past grandeur and
future glory and welfare of this Re
public, to allow Republican arro
gance and recklessness to trample
upon the manhood of this country.
Congressman Terry, of Arkansas,
is not only a good Democrat, but
is a very clever fellow. He is a
friend of the oppressed people of
the country, particularly of that
class of young folks who have got
ten marrying notions into their
Sheads. Mr. Terry said:
You may put money into the pockets of
- a mill owner by Imposing a tarifftax on lum
bqr, but what about the millions of the
I American people who need lumber to build
their homes ? The saw mill businessu may
be the kind of an "Infant industry" that you
- want to "encourage," but what about the
a young men who are taking our fair young
a women into life partnerships and needing
1 lumber to build their homes ? I want to
I say to you, Mr. Chairman, in confidence,
that that is the kind of **infant industry"
that I want to see encouraged.

-Fro, the News' way of thinking
- no o who lives in South Louis
a lana has the right to censure. Sena
I tor McEnery fof his vota on the
Dingley bill, and no citizen who
has the good fortune to be an in
habitant of .:tis rich section of
c Louisiana `should enjoy the inesti
i mable privilgge of claiming to be
r long to the Democratic party. Ac
t cording to the singular logic of our
able contemporary it is - only a
" North Louisiana sway-back Dem
- ocrat" who possesses the constitu
tional right to fil.d fault with Sena
a tor McEnery's course in the Senate.
. The News seems. not to know
that there are Democrats in this
r part of the State whose political
i convictions do not change with the
pI rice of sugar.
1 The News evidently forgets that
i of the two Louisiana segators, Mr.
t Caffery, who voted with the Demo
crats and against the infamous Ding
ley bill, is from the very heart of
i the sugar region of South Louisiana,
I while Gov. McEnery, who is the
l only Democrat in the Senate who
cast his vote with the Republicans
r and- in favor of the tariff bill, is
r from the parish of Ouachita within
i whose bounds it is doubtful if a sin
gle stalk of sugar-cane can be
found.
a Unfortunately some parishes in
South Louisiana give Republican
majorities, but our esteemed con
frere of the News should not be
deluded into the belief that we are
s all sugar-teats down here, even if
i we are out-numbered by those over
t grown patrons of the nipple.
