Last Tuesday a young negro,
charged with stealing a watch, tried
to brake out of jail. With the use
of a fork he succeeded in breaking
off several bricks from the wall in
one of the rooms on the ground
floor and with a little more work he
would have made a whole sufficiently
large to escape.
One thing that Lafayette needs
above all others is an ice factory.
We are surprised that some of our
citizens have not already invested
in an enterprise of this kind. No
town on the Southern Pacific road
possesses the same advantages as
Lafayette. Her shipping facilities
are far better than those of her sis
ter towns where ice factories have
proved successful ventures.
It is with regret that we have to
announce the departure of Mr. Cy
rus Guidry and family, also Mr.
Charles Jeanmard and family. They
left on Monday last to make their

energetic hard working young men,
determined to find employment and
they belong to our oldest and most
influential families, and although
we deplore their departure yet they
have the best wishes from one and
all for their success and happiness,
and we feel assured they will be
loved and respected by their new
friends as they are by those they
leave behind. -BreauxBridgeValley.

The subject, ",How to Interest
Parents," was then generally dis
cussed.
Miss Stella Truman, of Opelou
sas, then read an essay on "What
Pupils Expect of their Teachers."
The young lady reflected credit upon
herself by the ability and earnest
sincerity with which she presented
the duties and responsibilities de
volving upon the conscientious
teacher. The paper showed mature
thought and thorough biblical knowl
edge which latter was indeed thebasis
and inspiration of the entire essay.
Justice can not be accorded here
to the sterling merit of the article
for only those can appreciate it
who were fortunate enough to hear
its eloquent delivery.
The various Sunday Schools re
presented submitted the following

and at times very animated dis
cussion of the subject.

State convention: Bethel, Silas
Hoffpauir; Ridge, Abel Hoffpauir;
Lafayette, W. B. Torian, R. C.

Starcus Hoffpauir, treasurer; vice
presidents: W.B.Torian, Ben Avant,

ecutive committee: Hines Hoffpauir,

Gospel."
Other subjects were briefly dis
cussed among which may be men
tioned "I-Iouse to House Visitation."
The utmost enthusiasm prevailed
throughout the proceedings which
were interspersed with religious ex
excises and song service. Misses
Stella Truman and L. E. Hafkes
bring presided at the organ and
assisted by the young ladies and
gentlemen of the choir, rendered the
song service a most important
feature of the convention.
A vote of thanks was tendered
Mr. Tiebout for the able manner
with which he conducted the con
vention and for the deep intere'st
aroused by him in Sunday School
work.
The sum of $zo 5o was reported
subscribed to aid in carrying on the
work of the State Association.
Rev. T. S. Randle then made an
earnest andjfer vent appeal for more,
thorough and confcientious labor in
the cause and the convention ad
journed sine die by singing "God
Be With You Till We Meet Again."
A paper in the August Arenta which must
attract great attention deals with Keely's
navigation, and is written by Clara B. Moore.
It is a review of Keely's wonderful experi
ments and discoveries iu the construction of
his system of symlmthetic physics, a system
that is adverse to all the canons of mechan.cal
physics, and which opens up a new world of
force to the studen* of physical science.
Keeley's researches have lain beyond the
horizon of molecular physics; in the open
field of elemental force, where gravity,
cohesion, inertia and momentum are disturbed
in their haunts and diverted to use; where,
from unity of origin emanates infinite energy
in diversified forms. After years of experi
ment and research Keely had dascovered
that the subtle of etheric vapor, which had
eluded his every effort to confine within
walls of metal, and lbaifed his every attempt
to control, is the medium of nature's m ,4t
powrful agent, thu triune polar flow, an Il
which he las now harllnes~dl for uavigating
the air.

CARENCRO NEWS.
The Gazette Correspondent's
Weekly Resume of Items of
Interest in and About
Carencro.
-H on. A. I. Guilbeau went to
Lake Charles last week on a busi
ness trip.
-Mr. Cyrus Guidry and family,
formerly of Breaux Bridge, have
moved into and now occupy the
Melchior cottage.
-Our Police Jury should make
themiselves familiar with the pro
visions of the act recently passed
relative to the number of witnesses
allowed in criminal cases, and be
in a position to prevent the un
necessary expenditure of the peo
ple's money. The law permits six
witnesses for either side, except in
unusual cases, where either side can
upon written application to the
judge, declaring what they expect
to prove; summon six more wit
nesses, which would make twelve
the maximum number allowed in
any one case.
-Mrs. S. F. Steere and children,
of Shreveport, are visiting at Hu
ron.
-Mr. A. Cheffer has added to
his stock a general line of builders'
hardware.
-Master Walter B. Bloch re
turned to New Orleans last Tues
day, after spending several weeks
with relatives in Carencro.
-Capt. Cook is progressing
steadily with the grading of the
Teche railroad in the direction of
Breaux Bridge.
-Rumor has it that one of Avoy
elle's charming belles has captured
the heart of one of our young men.
-At the recent session of the
State Legislature there was an act
passed, providing for the refunding to
incorporated towns of certain por
tions of the licenses and taxes paid
into the parish treasury. The jour
nals feeling any interest in such
towns would be rendering a great
service by publishing the law in full,
so that we could know just what our
rights are, and what to expect.
Such a law is only right and just,
and would enable those towns pos
sessing ordinary enterprise, to ad
vance and devise much benefit
therefrom.
-A. Saligoni has opened a fruit
and vegetable stand opposite Mr. A.
I. Guilbeau's store.
-Mr. J. Blum was a visitor in
Opelousas last Sunday.
-There was quiet a pleasant re
ception and entertainment given at
the residence of Mr. E. M. Magnon
on the evening of Aug. 4th by the
,"Merry Twelve Social Club." The
following ladies and gentlemen
were present and enjoyed themselves
very much- Mesdames. E. M.
Magnon, V. E, Dupuis, F. Mouton,
and Mrs. C Daigu of New Orleans,
Misses Magnon, C. Prejean, Ber
nard, Guidry, Addison and Arais

Syd. Dupuis, C. Jeanmard, Clovis
Breaux, N. Magnor, Frank Mouton,
Felix Guilbeau, Simon Braussard,
S.. Arceneaux, J. B. Sonnier, and
Elie Bernard. We extend our con
gratulations to the "Merry Twelve,"
on the success of their first enter
tainment given for the pleasure of
the friends.
-Ve know two young ladies in
Carencro, who have, to say the
least, a very vivid imagination.
-Prof Charles Heichclheim will
open private school at the public
school building commencing Mon
day August 13. He will also assume
charge of the Carencro night school
same date. We know that there are
a number of young men who will
gladly avail themselves of the ad
vantages otffered by a properly con
ducted night school. Prof. Heichel
helm is a teacher of experience and
will give entire satisfaction,
-The many friends of Mr. I.
