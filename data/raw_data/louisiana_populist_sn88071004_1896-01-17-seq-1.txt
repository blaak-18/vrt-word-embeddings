THE AGENTS' REPORT.
BOSS ROTHSCHILDS CONFERS
WITH HIS FRIENDS.
SRounthern "Free Silver Democrat" and a
Western "Free SIlver Republican" Confer
With Their Politlal Employer and Tell
Him How They Manage.
A retent issue of the Washington
Silver rnight had a cut of Roths
childs seated with a .southern silver
1Democrat on one side and a western
silver Republican on the other, when
the following eolloquey took place:
Rothschild: Shentlemen, I vas reaty
to receive your reports.
Western Republican: May it please
your honor, my task is a difficult one.
My constitutents are against your gold
policy. Every man of them is for free
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1,
and if they knew I was in your service
my life would he the forfeit. You will
see by the written report which I pre
sent, the methods I pursue to get elect
ed to positions where I can serve you
bost. I use the tariff and tell the fool
Pepublicans in the silver states that
duties on lead, lumber, wool and other
things are more important to them
than silver, and I figure up what a vast
amount of these other articles
are produced and show them
how insignificant the product of
silver is. But my strong card is to
tell them that the Republican party is
the party of progress, and that we
must look to that party; that we can
get something through the Republican
party and nothing through any other
party. I discourage them about a new
party and tell them, as you have
directed, how Impossible it is
to organize a new party. I have been
compelled in the last year to make
three trips to ('hicago to get your
Socialiststo go out to my country and
tell the people" that all the trouble
arises from monopolieS, and the way
to do is to have the government do
everything and take charge of the
whole business: and point to some
things that the government does pretty
well--carrying the mails for instance
--and may to them that if the govern
meat did the farming and railroading,
building the faetories and the opening
of mines, it would be well done and it
would stop monopoly. This Socialist
card is a great one. You did well in
selecting them as a disorganizer. T'hey
work like a charm. AMr. Rothschild, t
you see that my services have been
very arduous, and I hope you will esti
mate them at their true value in dis- t
tributing your favors.
Rothschild: I abbreciate fully ze

Southern Democrat: The difficulties n
with which a southern Democrat is I
compelled to contend in assuming the :
character of Dr. Jeykil and Mr. Hyde a
are very great. The southern people n
are excitable but where they have con- I
fidence they believe with all their
hearts, but when that confidence is
shaken in the least they become the
most dangerous enemies in the world. t
I tell you, Mr. Rothschild, it is more f
dangerous to play the game we are
compelled to play than the business of i
acting the spy between two armies. a
We have to make the deception per
feet. a
Rothschild: How does you shentle
men manage dot game?
Southern Democrat: Why, negro
denomination is our great card. We i
have seceeded in many elections by a
telling the people if they don't vote the
ticket made in Wall street under your I
supervlskm (of course they don't know
that you supervise) that the Republi- t
ceans will put the negro on top of them c
and that will be the end of them. That t

A GREAT QUESTION.
STOP AND THINK OF INTEREST
ON MONEY.
Its Efect, Upon the Country are Hanefnl
Indeed-Some Think it Absolutely Nec
essary to Eliminate Int rest from Our
Economic System.
1 Ve:' man' honest antl well-meaning
1 people never stop to think a moment
on the question of inte'rest on montey
and its effect on the country. T'hey
hastily conclude that Ibecause they do
not hIorlrow and pay interest over the
bank counter that therefore the sub,
ject has no practical bearing on their
affairs, and they pass it by unheeded.
This position is wrong.
It is carelessness on your part. not a
desire to harbor a wrong.
Some of you raise wheat. You -end
it to the market and sell it to the
grain dealer. lie pays you what you
call cash--lank notes. Hlis promnisory
note is in bank at eight, or ten, or
I twelve Iwr cent. for the identical
money he pays you for the wheat. lhi
cuts the price as low as posihle and
then adds the interest on. If he does
not he will go out of business as a
bankrupt very soon. lie sells the
wheat to the wholesale dealer. His
note is in the bank at ten per cent. and
he adds it on. Then the miller buys
it. His note is in the bank at ten per
cent. and he adds it. lie manufactures
it into flour and sells to the baker,
whose note is also in bank at ten per
cent., and he adds it on. The baker
makes it into a 5-cent loaf and when
you buy it for your family you lay the
usury or interest all the way round.
Just so with every other line of pro
ducts. the interest enters many times
into the cost of every article ionsume.I
in society and the conumner fret:- the

A distingui-hcld gentleman. now tie

tration on a celeblrated occasion:
* Suppose that at the time James
town, Va., was settled, in 1607, ('apt.
Newport had purchased of the mother
country all the lands now within the
boundaries of the United States for the
sum of $1 and had given his bond and
that of his successors in this country
therefor. payable in :A_ years, and so
cured it by mortgage upon the lands
purchased. Most of you will say that
was a magnificent bargain. As to
whether it was a good bargain or not
depends upon the rate of usury named
in that bond. Suppose the rate
named was ten per cent compounded
annually. That debt would have
fallen due in 19.3) and would have
amounted to more than $1.0S ,tN1(,
(n00000,. while the value of all property
real and personal, in the entire nation
is only $70,C(Nt,Euf5).tIH$. Sulppose this
mortgage to be now foreclosed and the
mortgagee hid the full value of the
property: a nation of 70E,(tNuiN pae

--It is necessary to eliminate inter
est from our economic system. l'his
moloch of usury gathers tribute con
stantly every moment from everything
that has value. You cannot worship
your God in the observance of his ordi
nance by taking communion at the

gan, infidel, dividing, gathering and
concentrating communist, Usury, goes
on and on, in summer and winter, rain
and shine. day and night, weekday and
Sabbath, in prosperity and in advers
ity, depriving industry of the fruits of
its toil and piling up the wealth in the
coffers of the Rothschilds, Bavings and
Vanderbilts, unheeding the cries of
distress and the starvation of millions,
and defying the laws of G(;od.
,,This usury (interest) levies tribute
upon the swaddling clothes of the in

through all the life of that human
being to exact tribute from it each mo

ROASTS THE COURTS.
EUGENE V. DEBS DISCUSSES
THE WAYS OF JUSTICE.
Judges Are Often Corrupt Creature-
Jay Gould Said, "When I Want a
Jodge I Buy Him"--DeLpotlxm lure
and Simple.
We hold these truths to be self-evi
dent-that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain inalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.-Declaration of
Independence.
It has been held that in the political
institutions of the United States t! 're
are two fundamental facts recognized -
the sovereignty of the people and the
equality of conditions. It is held by
eminent jurists that these facts are or
iginal, perfect, and uncontrollable.
In the formation of the government
under which we live certain rights of
the individual are surrendered, but
never an inalienable right, never the
right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.
To invade such rights, to strike them
down, is despotism pure and simple.
It does not matter by what method
such rights are abridged or destroyed;
it does not matter under what circum
stances the rights are murdered or who
the assassin may be; it does not mat
ter whether a vandal court, a savage, or
a sultan perpetrates the crime, nor by
what juggling lies are clothed in robes
of truth, nor does it matter what high
offielals surround the bier upon which
a dead right is borne to its grave, or
what Mare Antony orations embellish
the funeral, the occasion simply cele
brates the death of rights essential to
freedom, and when they cease to exist,
though drums may beat and banners
wave and eloquent tongues glorify law,
the three cardinal rights-life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness-lie dead
in the presence of the people, and the
"sovereignty of the people" and the
"equality of conditions" go down to
gether.
It is not to be expected that a despot
ism is to be proclaimed from the house
tops and that the rights of the people
are to disappear as when earthquakes
swallow down cities. The apprach of
the calamity will be insidious. The
subtle and treacherous enemies of lib
erty will inject Into some law a provi
sion to be vitalized at the proper time
and made the weapon of those who
espouse the cause of wealth against
labor.
Such reflections are largely within
the boundaries of facts now in course
of development, and provisions which
are claimed to answer the demands of
the friends of despotic power are said
to exist in what are known as the inter
state commerce law and the anti-trust
law, which, as they are interpreted by
the courts, uproot and scatter to the
winds the right of railroad employes
to decide for themselves whether they
will continue or abandon work. as they
may elect, because, forsooth, this work
is of a "public" or "semi-public" char
acter, and hence the public, more prop
erly the government, under the laws
which the government enacts, at once
reduces the employe to a servitude that
must inevitably, unless all sense of lib
erty and Independence is crushed and
dead, result in revolution.
One of the astounding phases of the
controversy new going forward, involv
ing the inalienable rights of citizens, Is
the autocratlc power exercised by the
courts. It is dlfficult to find words for
the proper characterization of this
power. In such discussions it becomes
necessary to refer to the debasing meth
ods by which certain mental and
moral infirmities find their way to the
beach and are permitted to don the
robes of ofce. They are often the crea
tures of a corrupt appointing power and
are selected because of their willingness
to do the bidding of those who are able
to pay the price of their treason to jus
tice. Having gained notoriety as cor
poration lawyers, their study and am
bltlon having been to find law for the
protection of the Iniquitous practices of
corporations, they go upon the bench
to continue their corporation practice,
until men who have the means are dis
posed to follow the example of Jay
Gould, who said: "When I want a judge
I buy him;" and this debauchery of
courts has reached a pass that a ma
jority of the people regard courts, their
orders, and decisions, with profound
suspicion and contempt; and this de
bauchery, this stupidity which distin
guishes certain Judges, creates in the
public mind a continually intensified
scorn, because the people behold in such
things only the mockery of justice. They
see a petty tryant called a judge issuo
ing dynamite orders designed for the
destruction of the rights of working
men and their organlsations.
The practlces of corporations to de- 1
spoll workingmen are never so much as
hinated at; only the rights of corpora- 4
tlons to throttle, gag, crush, and de- 4
grade their employees recerive attention.
It ,ere useless to attempt to obscore I
the facts. Sophisms and chicane have N
had their day, and it is seen that an I
effort is being made by the courts to
subject employes to conditions such as
i farmer dayp arsm men to dmanuao e
the starry ensign of the rstlos as a
"flaunting lie."
It is held in certain quarters that
the courts are not deciding "that strikes
are always and everywhere illegal, but
only that striking must be done in such
a way as not to perpetrate an arbitrary
and grievous wrong upon the public."
A strike of railroad employes engaged
in the train service necessarily and al
ways subjects the public to inconven
ience, which is called "a wrong," hence
the intimation of the courts and the
conclusion of corporations that since
quitting employment on the part of em
ployes perpetrates this "wrong." this
inconvenience to the public, they shall
not abandon their employment. But
the courts do not intimate that it would
be a "public wrong" or a public inca: -
venic:ce for corporations at their pleas
ure to discharge one or 100 employes.
or to reduce them to starvation wages
and defrade them to peonage, hence it
will be observed that neither the courts
nor the corporations care a straw for
the fundamental fact of "equality of
conditions." which, once destroyed, no
matter by whom, the ship of state, like
a disabled ship at sea, drifts wherever
the winds of chance and fate may
drive it.
Are we to wait until every shackle is
riveted? Are we to insist on crying
"peace" when the shottei orders of
courts, deadly as bursting bombs, ren
der men as speechless as if they were
dead? I ring no alarm bells when there
is no danger approaching. I simply in
vite workingmen to contemplate the
shadows of events, as fraught with dan
ger as when Patrick Henry proclaimed:
"Give me liberty or give me death."
Let it be understood that the old land
marks are being rapidly obscured, de
stroyed, forever obliterated. The auto,
racy of courts, defining by legal jug
glery the rights of workingmen. the
rights of corporations, and the rights
of the people and the equality of condi
tions, and lobby-made laws by de
bauched votes strike right and left and
always at the rights of workingmen.
They are shearing from Sampson's
head his locks of power, they are seek
ing to make him blind to their pur
poses, they laugh at his calamity and
mock at his fear, but it were better to
desist, better to be just, else the labor
Sampson may some time grasp the pil
lars of the temple of despotism In
America and re-establish the "sover
eignty of the people" and the "equality
of conditions" upon Its ruins.

LEGION CIRCULAR NO. 8.
The election is over. We have
gained wherever we had a state ticket.
We have no cause for sorrow, except
the agony we feel for the oppressed
people. If they had energy and zeal
enough to organize they would not be
crushed. It is apparent to all that we
must organize. We have gained in
every locality where we have the Le
gion at work. It is too late to perfect
another plan. It took three years to
establish the Legion. It meets every
want of our party. By organizing now
a Legion in every township we can win
in that locality. All it needs is unity
of action. When you organize send
5 cents to Rev. J. D. Botkin, Neodesha.
Kansas, and get his book on plan of
work. If this method is followed we
can carry the election. We must act
speedily. It will be too late if we wait
until the national convention. We will
lose the long hours of the winter. We
can not afford to lose one minute. It
is folly to sit and growl and find fault.
It is more than a crime to wait on the
so called leaders of the party. Let the
people act. Let every ardent soul who
loves the cause of humanity and will
sacrifice time to organize send for
commission as scout or county recruit
r uing ofmcer. If you have no time for that
send for papers and organize at home.
and then appoint a committee to plant
other Legiond in all the surrounding
country. We send supplies free, but
want stamps to mail them.
If the people will not move the cause
will perish. We should not lay down
and let the enemy trample us under
foot. If each one of the six million
people eligible as members of the Ie
gion would join and pay 10 cents en
trance fee and 10 cents annual dues,
the campaign fund for 1896 would be
abundant.
If all who are able would send $1 for
certilflcate of membership, we can raise
a fund that would furnish all the
speakers and literature free.
The brave Coxey, the gallant Burket.
the eloquent and manly Pettitt would
have won if every precinct had been
organized In each state. I appeal to
every willing worker In our party; to
every manly heart, to every tender
souled woman to help this work. I may
issue, as one critic says, "bombastic cir
culars," but I must do something. My
sworn duty demands It. I wish I could
round the trumpet call that would rally
the people. I pray that the feeble word.
I writ may touch many loyal hearts.
It takes a circular every month to
even wake the sleeplng multitude for
one day. I again appeal to all our
editors, to our great writers to seand
the alarm and urge the whole member
ship of our party to combine oa the
National Legion.
We esn marris in sohid column to
victory, If we pct npa this call.
PAUL VANDeRVOORT.
