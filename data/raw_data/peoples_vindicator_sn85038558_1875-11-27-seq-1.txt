showed a praiseworthy example of fa
retrenchment in curtailing its own 1st
expenses. Instead of costing fromr 'a
$3110,00 to $500,000, as predicted by ba
the Republicans who were anxious to ad
maintain the carpet-bag Constitution, pa
it cost only $l1,000, an amount which or
will be more than saved in one year 014
by the reduction in the pay of 'meme- Pr
bers of the legislature, and by limit- mu
ing the length of the session. Among the
other reforms is the repeal of the sec- eli
tion in the Constitution which the WC

The Standard Process of Con
Vortaig Pork into Hams.
From the South Jeraeman.
The best breed of swine for bAms
and bacon is the Berkshire, beeusen
its meat is so muac more lean, tender
and jucy than that of other swine.
"VWell marbled" is the teeblial
phrase for this. Fat pork is ft for
salting and barreling, for, the NortdlJ
ern market, but nOt for Iamd; shoal
ders and bacon: An ordinary tecipte
for converting pork into bacon is to
kill the hog in cold weather, hang
the carcass up over night to let the
animal heat escape from it, then cut
up and pack in pieces in a tab or bar
rel between coarse layers of salt;
avt nlat - ."-. enoh to
near up an egg, an am,... t-osnu
the tub or barrel ti all the pleeed
are covered. When the meat is sf
ticiently saturated, which will be in i
frw weeks, take out the pieces and,
hang them up in a smoke-house. If
a gallon of molasses, or its equiva
lent in sugar is added to the.brine,
it gives, greater sweetness to the
meat. A few spices also add to thie
flavor when mixed with the brine;
such as cloves,. allspice and cinna
mon.. If I ere going to make mudc
bacon I would, in Mr. O'Neill's place;
address my inluiries to a noted pok
packer and bacon-curer of St. Louil
or LonI Tfille,Ml ahey are particularly
nice (p this, and every seamod there is
probably some little improvement
made in the-process. When I visited
the bacon-eorens of Cincinnati, ad

would not scald the earcass to scrape
off the hair, as they said this injured
the quality o the bacon, and rena
dered it less innm and solid, but they
singed it off by burning with straw;
Nor would they put it into brinae, bi
rubbed dry salt on both sides pf the
pieces. packed these bp on shedltes i
a cool place, changing 'the pleces:
every few days and rubbing i more
malt. After doing this several times
for weeks, then the pieces were dlean
edandesiolted. Spices4 iepneryklt
