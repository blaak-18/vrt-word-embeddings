`"e are authorried to announce
ADX)LPII L'I ERISSO)N, as a
c n:lidate for re-election to the
office of Mayr of the city of
Natchitoc]es, at the approaching
election.
Mr. S. I). Kearney, our associ

with us last week for the purpose
of holding; down th!. edit''rial chair
of the Louisiana lteformer, a new
Populist journal that will is no

Dec 6.-6t.
Mr. Adolph L'herisson announ
ces his name elsewhere in this issue
for re-election to the office of May
or, which he has so ably filled for
the past four years.
When one remenhmbers the old
days of rowdyism that Natchito
cbes has witnesse.l, and the young
er days of rascality that many
other cities are now suffering, they
will turn with a sigh of relief to
the honest, peaceahle and prosper
ous adm:nistration of Natchitoches'
present able Mayor, and will re
fuse to give him up for untried
adventurers.
Mr. L'horisson is a Natchitochian
to the manor born, and his quiet
unasunming manners and sterling
worth as a citizen coupled with the
great satisfaction given by his wise
administration of the mayoralty,
will make him =z candidate hard
to beat for that position April next.
We omitted a menton last week
of a p·l at visit from Hon. B.
W. Bailey d family, who were
on their way to their new home at
Mind.a, Webster parish. Mr.
iisy goes to Mind; n to edit the
Beamer at Liberty, a new Popu
list paper that will soon issue from
that sity.
Mr. Dailey, like the patriot that
he is, a merileed the strong ties
ofa h childhood home and of later
frrieds, and gone where duty calls,
Is doing so, he declnes the
umamosm support of his party
for the Sat blekaJte, in his bomq

,put an end forever to the rcrzime
o(f the Iallot box stuffer in our
State. The c,',nstitlltional conven
tion wVou lI rldctlee expenses m1ore
thaniil 1 n per year. But its
chief work, its greatest tria:lph
would be the re-toration of an
honest hnallot and the pruvcention of
fraudl in elections.

The mIiOst sarcastic remark we
heard at Shreveport was that a
pople \\ºho favor baillot lb)x stilf
fing ought to chooso ballot hiex
stuffers for rulers, so that the
public sentiment could be prop'r
ly rel resented. In other words,
the officers ought to be and are a
true index of the character of a
people.
Let us have a constitutional con
vention before we sink lower ! If
we permit the corrulat, debasing,
c,lliresive regime of the ballot
box stuffer to continue, we and
our children must sutffer for it, not
branded and bani.hed like Cain,
but coilu;elle-I to t.-laini, selfdooun
ed to welter in a ccesi: ool of moral
and political filth.--M,nroo Bulle
tin.
This is the way the brilliant,
brainy Judge Gunby, editor of the
Monroe Bulletin, greets the so
call:ed Democratic ticket, named by
the pow wow of ballot-box stuf
fers and boodlers, at Shreveport,
two weeks ago.
Judge Gunby is not a Democret
for the name's sake alone and as that
is all there is left of Democracy in
that party now he is thoroughly
dsigusted with it.
The Bulletin is one of the lead
ing weeklies in North Louisiana,
and if it keeps up the splendid
strokes for reform that it has been
making under its present able
managem:ent, it will ho a power in
the land.
Elsewhere we give another Dem
ocratic estimate of this fraudulent
ticket, which is trying to usurp
true Democracy.
We have to thank Messrs. Le
mee & Tucker, Insurance Ag'ts, on
2nd Street, Messrs. Alexander,
Hill & Breazeale, Insurance Ag'ts.
on St. Denis Street, and the Ex
change Bank, for Calendars, Blot

t- Jan. 3.
We were presented this week
with a new March, entitled the
Louisiana Normal School, compmo
sed by Miass Eliza Dranguet. From
the reputation of the family as
Smusicians, we are sure this pro
duction must be excellent.
On last Friday evening, at the
d Opera House, one of the largest
gatherings ot the seasons witness
ed the Concert given by our State
University Guitar, Mandolin and
Glee Clubs.
The music rendered was excel
lent, and much appreciated by our
people.
u The Picayune, a goldhug organ,
says the platform adopted by the
-s Shreveport cons ention is very sat
isfactory to the goldbugs. It is
l aiso ver, satisfactory to Blanchard,
 Cunningham, and all those fellows
who were "just dying" to have free
silver inside the party.
Got the counting machine plodg
ed to their re-election, and that's
. free silver enough for them; they
are in Washington and New Or
n leans now, no doubt laughing over
a the way they hoodwinked the six
teen-to-oners, and tied them on the
"tails of their respective kites, last
summer resolutions to the contra
ry, notwithstanding.

Resolved, that we denoune the I,
I cringing cowlardice and subseirvi
ency to ring rule of the late demo- A
Scratic convention held at Shreve
port. as was made manifest by its B
failure to give an expression upillOn
the money queation, the nii t im
portant one now before the peo- ,
ple. L
Resolved, that we need neither 1
tariff tinkering nor interest-bear
ing bonds to increase revenues or o
to protect the the treasury; that t
the free coinage of silver and a L
liberal issue of legral tender green
backs will speedily bring prosperi
ty to the whole country. We are i
olpposed to cloture rule or other in
f famous measures for party gain. k

Democratic Prophets.
The Democratic papers and pol
r iticians have been busy ever since d:
their Shreveport pow wow, fixing
up a ticket for their so-called Pop
ulist-Republican fusion.
With all gravity they have as
sured the country that such a com
bination did exist, that it would
name Senator Henry McCall, of
Ascension, as its choice for Gov
ernor, and that he would accept
same and make the race.
Unfortunately for their standing
as prophets or sensible politicians,
Senator McCall knocked the stuf
fing out of their "straw man" by
declaring that he never at any time
had any notion of running for Gov
ernor, and that the sugar planters
would probably put out a ticket of
their own.
Should the Democrats lose this
hobby of "Populist-Republican fu
sion, they will be sorely pressed
for argument to defend their own -
Scorrupt combine that smells to "
Heaven of its innate wickedness.
That Comblie.
-We asked a prominent minister
one day this week what he thought
of the Foster-Fitzpatrick combine
since the Shreveport convention.
His reply was that he thought it
went fnrther than a combine; that
it was an unlawful marriage con
tract, and that the Shreveport tick- A
et was the bastard result thereof.
Those who doubt the unholy al
liance are among those who don't
want to see-- he blindest of men.
The Winn parish delegates to the
Alexandria convention ard Hon.
B. W. Bailey, Dr. A. P. Collins,
J. J. Dickerson, Rev. J. P. Pat
ton anl t heriff J. H. Crawford.
Five more will probably be ap
pointed by Chairman McCain, in
time to attend.
