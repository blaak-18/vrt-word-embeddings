The Greatest Medical Discovery
of the Age.
KENNEDY'S
MEDICAL DISCOVERY,
DONALD KENNEDY, OF ROXBURY, MASS.,
Has discovered in oine of our common
pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
down to a common Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit is always experienced from
the first bottle, and a perfect cure is war
ranted when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains like needles passing
through them; the same with the Liver or
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts being
stopped, and always disappears in a week
after taking it.
If the stomach is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of it.
Dose, one tablespoonful in water at bed
time, and read the Label.

F. ALL the
Fourth of July
celebration
ever witnessed
in Chicago that
which has just
transpired was
far and away
the most mem
orable. Jackson
park. was th
head center of
the festivities,
S fill'ffl!" " but the whole
, l, , city, including
S n" t h e countless
hosts of foreign
r era and stran
gers in ou
midst, seemed to partake of the spirit
of revelry. For several days previous
to the Fourth the interest in the com
ing event had been waxing greater and
greater as the expected treat drew near,
and the pent-up enthusiasm of the pa
triotic spirits burst forth and found mo
mentary relief in the surreptitious dis
charge of something with a bang to it,
and the louder the bang the greater the
relief. The hardy youngster of the
street made himself exceedingly pro
miscuous by the din which he created
whenever he found himself in a place
apart from the presence of the blue
coated preservers of the city's peace,
and he kept it up so assiduously.day
and night that quietly-disposed people
had a hard time of it trying to get
more than three consecutive winks
of sleep at a time. This is nothing
new, of couise, on the Fourth of July,
but it did seem as though the firecrack
ers were better this year and went off
with a louder bang, and the torpedoes
were larger and more reliable and
made twice the usual noise. The guns
and cannons were on their good beha
vior also and fairly rent the atmosphere
in their efforts to swell the volume of
sound that was being poured forth in
honor of American independence, Co
lumbus and the world's fair.
As has been said, the grand attrac
tion was Jackson park. There from
morning till night no sound of guns or
tireworks was heard, as the discharge
of any such was in the interest of pub
lic peace and property strictly prohib
ited, but when night came there was
racket and fireworks enough to satisfy
the wishes of the most hilarious cele
brator on the grounds. The pyrotech
nics were all in the charge of author
ized persons who were skilled in their
use, and they were confined to the
water front where they were not likely

to endanger the precious buildings of
the White ite Ciy. The pieces displayed
were some of the finest creations
which those skilled in pyrotechnics
were capable of putting together, and
the crowd of lpeople that witnessed the
magnificent spectacle must have num
bered nearly two hundred thousand.
The exercises began with speech
making, singing, etc., all of which at
tracted a goodly portion of the crowd,
but the main center of interest during
the day was among the foreigners of
Midway Plaisance. There everybody
was celebrating. Even the inky-skinned
women warriors of Dahomey were do
ing their best to honor Uncle Sam.
They were clothed, as far as it is their
custom to be clothed, which at most is
very sparingly, in the stars and stripes,
and presented a very gorgeous appear
ance. They, like most of the other na
tionalities on the Plaisance, gave spe

eial performances in honor of the occa
sion, and they seemed to partake fully
of the prevailing spirit of revelry.
The outpour from the city was some
thing enormous and must have been in
the aggregate very near a half million.
The admissions footed up considerably
over a third of a million. But the vast
number who daily come and go by the
"underground" route would in all prob
ability greatly augment the receipts
were they to have paid their passage.
At the conclusion of the exercises,
which lasted far into the night, a
strange sight was presented in the out
pouring of the multitude toward the
gates. All the avenues were black
with the slowly-moving masses of hu
manity. As far as the eye could reach
in every direction they came swarming
and surging through every opening.
From all quarters to the exits the
Stream flowed on until the railway
platforms were choked to a standstill.
As fast as the trains could load and
leave they lopped off the crowd, but
others quickly took the places of the
departed ones. Thus the exodus con

iDhns Chicago hsaseen her Columbian
Fou b of July, and it is. safe to say
that those who participated in the eel
ebration thereof will not soon forget
the day. Altogether it was a grand
day and surprisingly free from acci
dents. There were a few minor mis
fortumes, but nothing of a very serious
natuge occuagqd at the grounds.
A world's fair Sunday school building
has just been completed in the environs
of the fair grounds, which is attracting
considerable interest among church
people both here and abroad. It is a
beautiful structure, built after the
fashion of the fair buildings, and is.a
model of architectural excellence. It
is located just across from - tha.fair
grounds on Stony Island avenue, on
the western side, about midway of the
park. The object of the building is to
provide a meeting place for those in
terested in Sunday school work during
the fair. The building will be removed
after the close of the exposition. The
lot on which the structure stands is
. -_ .

ninety by one hundred and fifty feet.
The lease for a year cost five thousand
five hundred dollars. Arrangements
have been made for different classes.
The lower floor contains an auditorium
proper, called the intermediate depart
ment. Three wings reach out from this,
in which are respectively the primary,
junior and senior departments.
A series of curtains makes it possible
to throw all four rooms into one. From
each there is a good view of the plat
form, which is situated in the rear of
the building. Above is a gallery. The
entire seating capacity will be twelve
hundred. A library is in the front,
which may be used as a reading room.
It will be occupied by the American
Bible society. A rare exhibit of Bibles.
including many old manuscripts, will
here be shown.
The building was erected by contri
bution from Sunday school workers
throughout the United States and Can
ada. The whole expense will be twen
ty thousand dollars, of which eighteen
thousand dollars has been subscribed
for." From time to time Sunday school
conferences will here be held.
Several foreign buildings have just
been dedicated. among them being
those of Ceylon, Venezuela and Costa
Rica. That of Ceylon on the lake
front to the north of Germany's build
ing is one of the most curious structures
at the fair. It is constructed of ma
terial brought from Ceylon and in the
doorways, steps and balustrades are
some rare pieces of native carving.
Amcng the exhibits are a great many
odd articles formed of native woods
and grasses, and among the valuables
of the display are some very fine speci
mens of filigree work in silver and cop
per.
The buildings of Venezuela and Costa
Rica are both marvels of excellence
architecturally and they both contain
many articles of rare interest. The
commissioners who have these buildings
in charge are exceedingly affable and
courteous and do their best to make all
visitors thoroughly at home.
Laplanders at the Fair.
When the next world's fair is held it
is not probable there will be any Lap
landers present. Ten years ago there
were twenty-seven thousand Lapland
era. Now there are only eleven thou
sand. l)eath and amalgamation are
making away with them as a distinc
tive branch of the human family.
Ethnologically this may be the truth.
It doesn't seem to agree -very well with
what old King Bull, the head of the
Midway colony, claims for himself and
family. Bull says he is one hundred
and twelve years old. His son, Bals
Bull, he says is ninety years of age.
Bals Hygd Bull, the grandson, is sev
enty-three, Bals Hygd Bull has a
daughter fifty-nine years old, and her
son is forty-one. The grandson of Bals
Hygd Bull has a son twenty-nine years
old. The daughter of this twenty
nine-year-old Bull is fourteen, and she
has a little girl two years old. Thus,
it appears, according to old King Bull,
that eight generations of his family are
living.
June Receipts.
Neatly two and three-fourths million
people paid to pass through the gates
at the fair during the month of June.
Of this number over two and one-half
million were adults, and the others
were children. During May the paid
admissions numbered 1,050,037, 22,825
being children. This is an increase of
over 100 per cent. for the month. The
average daily attendance during May
was a little over 37.500. For June it
was nearly 90,000. The gate receipts
for May were 4519,312.15. For June
they amouxnte4 to nearly 01,500,000,

This dld liberty bell is the one single
k. object of greatest interest among all
,the splendors.and Wonders of the White
City. To the sturdy, patriotie Ameri
can it is an object of veneration. To
the uncultured, to the foreigner, it Is
an objectof interest and curiosity. If
that bell had rung for a free Italy
when the lilies of Florence and the
white cross of Savoy were dipped in
blood in the old Garibaldi days itoueald
have been. worshiped in the land of
Virgil to-day. But Americans are more
cold-blooded and practical; yet Ameri
can patriotism sometimes finds its vent
here even in tears.
Eire is a story one of the stalwart
Philadelphia reserve policemen told re
cently, but one of the hundreds of
episodes that are constantly falling dit
der their attention. The old bell, in its
yellow frame of beams, stands just in
side the entrance in the wide vestibule
of the Pennsylvania building.
"One day, a couple of weeks ago,"
.began the reserve, "my attention was
attracted to an old gentleman who
stood just outside the door there. He
was a tall, fine-looking, white-haired
man, about sixty-five years of age. He
stood for" about five minutes with the
people coming-and-going past him, and
every once in awhile he would wipe his
eyes. I didn't understand it. At last I
got up to get a drink of water, and as I
passed him'the old gentleman stopped
me, and, looking into my eyes, said:
" 'Young man, 1 want to tell you that
you have had a greater honor conferred
upon you than has been placed on Gro
ver Cleveland's shoulders.'
"'How's that?' I asked.
"'The honor of guarding that old
bell,' he went on; 'that bell is more
to me than anything in these grounds.
I've traveled seventeen hundred miles
to see it, and now I'm going home con
tented,' and then he. broke right down
and began to cry. HIi walked out on
the porch, but in about ten minutes he
came back and asked me if he mightn't
jusb touch the belL Between you and
me." said -the great big policeman, "I
would have liked to let him do it, but I
told him it was against positive orders
to let anyone touch or handle it. Then
he left."
Thousands of stories of love for that
liberty for which the old bell rang have
been missed right here for want of a
historian. The other afternoon, shortly
before two o'clock a man with a lunch
box under his right arm, and leading a
little lad of eight by. the hand, entered
the building. Behind them came a
tired looking woxhan, the mother, with
a little girl of six by the hand. They
were what the world would call com
mon people, in so far as wealth and so
cial standing went. The father, who
was about thirty-five, wore a fifteen
dollar suit of clothes, and the mother's
dress was a cheap chintz
The father and son halted at the
bright nickel railing around the bell.
The man looked with a sort of silent
awe at the bell for an instant, then he
took off his hat and held it in his hand.
He darted a quick, sensitive, - Inquiring
look around to see that he was not
overheard, and stooping, said, loud
enough though to be heard by a gen
tleman near by: "Take off your hat,
)Pddie."
"What for, papa?" inquired the lad in
surprise.
"Why, this is the old liberty bell I
was telling you and Helen about last
night, do you mind?"
The young patriot's hat came off and
it remained off till he cast a last look
backward at the tuneless old relic.
But there is another side to these
patriotic expressions. It is the sulful
and abundant ignorance of some Amer
icans. The gratuitous distribution of
one hundred and ten thousand copies
of the history of the bell has been but
as the rays of a tallow dip in the ab~
sorbing darkness of some American ig
norance.
"Oh, my Lord, it's awful to hear some
of the questions people ask, and the re
marks they drop when they see the
bell," continued the reserve officer,
with a world-weary sigh. "Decent ap
pearing, intelligent-looking people
most of them, too. But the worst are
the people who know it all, or think
they know it all. They are mostly
youngsters.
"The other day an old lady came up
to the railing. There were a couple of
young girls with her about seventeen
or eighteen years of age. This old
lady was deeply impressed, and, turn
ing to the girls, said: "There, mry
dears, is the bell that rang for the
declaration of iniependence when my
grandfather, and your great-great
grandfather.was fighting in the revolu
tionary war.'
" 'Why, no it isn't, grandmother,'
said one of the youngsters; 'that's the
bell that used to hang in the steeple of
the church that George Washington at
tended.'
" 'It isn't anything of the kind,' spoke
up the other girl; 'that's the bell that
hung on the state house ii. Philadel-'
phin. When the British entered tihe
city the bell was taken down and was
hidden in the Delaware river for forty
years. It was cracked when they
were tolling it for George Washing
ton's death.'
"That's only a sample of some
American ignorance," continued the
officer. "Most of the people associate
the bell in some way with the declara
tion of independence, but I'm blessed
if there isn't hundreds of Yahoos who
come here who never seem to have
heard of the declaration."
"How about European visitors?"
"Oh, there's thousands of them, but
they seem to be pretty well posted,
although some of the English are
awfully stupid when it comes to con
necting the bell with our brsaking
away from Great Britain. They know
that it is a wonderful relic and take
everything else for granted."
So far as the venerable relic is con
cerned, there is a laek of description
about it, which would go far with a
certain class of foreigners, and a good
many Americans too, in assisting them
to understand its presence herA Three
little placards in English, French and
German, hung in the vestibule of the
Pennsylvania building, and setting
forth in about one hundred words the
history of its memorable ringing July
4, 1776, seem almost a necessity.
Then there has been a great volume
of epic poetry on the subject of the bell
and its historic voire, some meritorious
that will live, despite the historical
errors embodied in the verses, others
that are wortlhless in every sense. The
best might be secured and the bare
walls of the corridors line, with these
tributes of the poets neatly framed.
