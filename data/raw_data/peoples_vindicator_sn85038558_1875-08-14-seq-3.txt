found full and plain instructions for

er, give more distance to the vine than
he recommends, owing to difference in
elimate. I would plant in rows nine
feet wide and ten feet in the drill, so as
to give more wood to the vine, and a'
better circulation of air.

A Represoltatlve and Champion of American
Art Taste !
s Tropectus for 1S75-Eighldh Year.
10 TR U" R Sl fat"ENE :
TILE ART JOLINAL OF ABMERICA,
ISSUED MIOYTIJTLY.
"'A Mlagnificent Conceltioi,, wonderfuilly
carried out."
The necessity of a populnir medniu,l for
the 1reprvsentation of the proelntions of
our great artists, has always b)e4on' rteng
iizeld, uand many attemnlts have b1wn
mlade to nmeet the want. 'The snce11(I'ssi
fiilutres which so invaribly fullowel r.. h
attempt in tlis country 9to ~t:ll,lish II
art journal, did not prove the indiler
once of the people of America, to thi
claims of high art. So soon as :t proper
apprcniation of the want and1 an ability
to meet it were showin, the public a;t
once rallied with enthusiasm to its sup
port, and the result was a great artistic
and conunercial triumnph-THE ALI)INE.
THE ALI)INE, while issued with all the
regularity. has none of the taemlporary or
timely iterest charael cteristic of ordinary
peridiicals. It is an elegant miscellany
of lure, light and graceful literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci
mnens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding Inlulber affords
a fresh pleasure to its fricnds,lhe real
value and heauty of the ALIINE will be
most appreciated after it has been bound
up at the close of the year. While other
journals may claim superior cheapness, as
compared with rirals of a similar class,
the ALDINE is a unique and original con
ception-alone and unapproached -also
lttely without competition in price or
character. The possessor of at complete
volume cannot duplicate the quantity of
fine paper and engravings in any other
shape or numler of volumes for ten times
its cost; and thenu, there is the Chromo
besides !
National feature"rofi THE ALDINE
must be taken in no narrow sense. True
art is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not conline itself entirely to the
reproduction of nativo art. Its mission
is to cultivate a broad and lappreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate only
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thtus,
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDINE. as at leading characteritic, the
productions of the nuost noted American
artists, attoution will always be given to
specinmns front foreign masters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and instruc
tion obtainable from home or foreign
sonrces.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magnilicent ,
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can be afforded by any inferior
page. The judicions interspersion of
landscape, marine, rine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light and graceful accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tures, with only such technical disqrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Premium for 1875.
Every subscriber for 1875 will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
samue noble dog whose picture in a for
mer issue attracted so much attention,
"MAN'S UTSELFISH FRIEXD"
will be a welcome in every home. Eve
rybody loves such a dog, and the portrait
is executed so true to the life, that it
seems the veritable presence of the ani
mnal itself. 'h'le Rev. T. De Witt Tal
mage tells that his own Ntewfoundland
dog (the finest in Brooklyn, barks at it!
Although so natural, no one who sees
this premium chrome will have the
slightest fear of being bitten.

subscriber to THE ALDINE for 1875 is

all the privileges of

The Saturdayct Evening Post,.
The Oldest and Best itory Paper Pub
lished.,
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more tlhan half a century the
Saturday Evening P'ost has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and hs ever borne a
widespread and lubulemishe reputation
for the insuiparseed'parity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneoaus reading matter.
It i pr-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not he read at any ireside without
objection from the most ftastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhapn as its younger contcmlltporaries,
is not, like that of some of themn, bleta
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SUlRE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on anly ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the 8aturday Even
ing Poet has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in thie
futurey and with this object in view we
will effect a marked iimprovemenut i eve
ry departnient of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers ofadmitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its foramer attractions,
and .adding nIany junieions ani pleas
ing novelties, by stlidylng lhow to please
aaml cultivate rite popular taste, by in
creasinlg ilnditry and eniterprise, anid by
enlarged familities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
cont.inue to mtaiutain the clain of the
Siturday Eveuning Post to its title of Til
OLwisT ANO TinL anT'r of Family Story
Papers.
