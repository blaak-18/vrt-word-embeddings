FRIDAY, October 19. 1894.
People's Party Candidate
FOR CONGRESS
OF THE FOIURTHT CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICT OF LOUIJISANA,
HON. B. W. BAILEY,
OF WINr.
LET US USE OUR COMMON
SENSE.
The Democrats of the Fourth
Congressional District have pre
pared and published an address, in
which they say: "Mr. Ogden is
presented to you as an avowed ad
vocate of free silver at a ratio of
1 to 1."
How does this tally with Mr.
Ogden's endorsement of the Cleve
land administration at Alexandria
Every man who has any knowledge
of public affairs at all knows that
the Cleveland administration is dia
metrically opposed to the free coin
age of silver at any ratio. This
question was voted upon by the
last congress, and every proposi
tion to coin silver at any ratio, was
voted down at the behest of Gro
ver Cleveland, who is an avowed
advocate of the single gold stand
ard, and Mr. Ogden has endersed
his course. Now voters, ask your
own good common sense if the two
positions are consistent. It is just
as easy to believe that Mr. Ogden
is a white man and at the same
time a black one, as to believe he
is a free silver Democrat and a
Cleavland Democrat; this is a pre
posterous absurdity. Now, as Mr.
Ogden has made this straddle,
which leg s he likely to stand on
when he gets to congress Ishe
Ikely to remember his reprementa
tions to the people, (few of them
do) or is he likely to be swayed by
themar whom he has openly .o
dorsmed as being right? Csa you
take chances on ueha manl There
isno party platform that pledges
Mr. Ogden to anything.
Agaia,the address sys: "The
foadation stone of the Democracy
is its opposition to class legsltion
ia all itb form." This is certainly
a uarkaMs assertionl for a party
that has bmn in akolut control of
every brah of the govermnuat,
and held Elevn amcathe muion
etof o~r, ad yet we say with
sInt the her ca msouonfl contra
daio, tha et trusts, aorpora
tim and emDbitions, (zecept la
ber oranI**ms) awe in pedr

pockets of the whiskey trust, the
sugar trust and the money trust,
and at the same time voted millions
out of the pockets of the farmer
and laborer.
The address further charges that
"The Populist party, feeling vague
ly that the masses of the people
have been oppressed, &c., would
essay to correct the evils by class
legislation." This assertion, first
makes light of the claim of the
Populist that the people are suffer
ing, intimating that such a claim is
a vague one, this we will leave to
the people to answer. But when
it comes to the charge against the
Populist that they are seeking class
legislation, it is too absurd to even
aspire to the plane of common
sense. The Populists advocate
laws that will put each and every
individual upon the same footing
in his efforts to feed, clothe and
educate his family, and when men
make such assertions as contained
in the address, we can not attrib
ute it to anything but ignorance of
the principles of the People's par
ty. The Populists hold that the
government is the people, and that
it does not belong to Cleveland
and his coterie of national bankers
and railroad and other corporation
lawyers, as is supposed by our
Democratic friends. Why do they
not come boldly to the front and
discuss issues, instead of dealing in
these misleading assertions. There
is not a man who thinks, who will
not say that the masses of people
have lost more by the shrinkage of
value in produce since the repeal
of the purchasing clause of the
Sherman law, than at any time in
the history of this country, and
that the Democrats are solely res
ponsible for that fact. Every la
borer in the land can testify to this.
There is no use trying to hide it.
Like Banquos ghost, "it will not
(down." Then why not meet these
issues squarely in the face. The
People's party is the only party
that offers any relief-the Demo
cratic and Republican parties have
never gotten further than the tariff
issue, where %hey have been for
thirty years.
Tbhe Present Conditions To Be
Maintained.
The administration and the Dem-.
ocratic party evidently are looking
for breakers ahead. They know
what Is mapped out for this conm
ing Congress to do when it meets
in December, and that there is to
be another squeeze of the laborer
in the interest of capital is mani
fest from the movement of the Na.
tional army. Three regiments will
be stationed in the South; one at
New Orleans, one at Little tock,
Ark., and one at Atlanta, Ga.
Secretary Herbert of the navy,
aims states that he will recommend
to Congress that a naval station be
established at Nlew Orleans. This
undoubtedly means that there is to
be another squeeze by the capital
ists, which in fiEnt has already
began. Carnegie has already re
duced the wages of 5000 of his
workmen and given notice of fur
ther reduction. In addition to this,
the ti factories are shutting
down, and the army of unemploy.
ed will in all probability be greater
thami ever known, and of course
starvation is not going to malntain
vezy serene and placid dispoeitions
among this mass of suatennrag he
airty, therefore the only concla
sluo to bedrawn Is, that the Un
ited States governmmt is dixing to
establish military power at short
notice.
This ay be tken as a notice,
that theim present eoditions are to
be mantaisned if it takes the Un.
ited States army to do it. Don't
you think yeou had better lay down
y-r senthmet ad leek the bets

Take Courage.
But a few years ago the Popu
lists were derided, ridiculed and
abused by the subsidized press and
speakers of the country, and had
it not been born of the spirit that
is to rule this American people in
the future, it must long since have
succumbed to the effect of the vil
lainous falsehoods that have been
hurled at it. But not so, like all
other revolutions it is never to go
backward, but onward and finally
accomplish the good work intend
ed for it in the beginning. And like
all other revolutions that have
been successful in the redemption
of nations, it started among the
class of people that are not seek
ing office, therefore it is not sus
ceptible of the charge of office
seeking. It started where all op
position to oppression starts, among
the oppressed masses. Where else
could it have started ? Who arises
in their manhood to defend the
country against a foreign enemy ?
The common masses, who as a rule
know nothing but honesty and pu
rity of purpose. The masses.
And to the masses must all
countries look for a healthy
government. The most prominent
men of both old parties are recog
nizing this fact, and are fast throw
ing off the bond of allegience to
the old parties whose days of use
fuluess they feel is over, and hon
estly casting their powerful intelli
gence with the masses of the peo
ple in this great reform movement.
As a matter of course, these men
are doing so after investigation and
conviction that such a move is right,
and there is no better evidence than
the fact that they always give in
vincible and unanswerable argu
ment in support of their action.
This class of men was, of cour se,
slow to move without investiga
tion--this was right, and adds
greatly to their standing as men of
thought and intelligence, and the
fact that they have come speaks
volumes in their favor, as men who
have the courage of their convic
tions. When they decided that
such a course was right they dared
to face all the opprobious epithets
that could be hurled at them by the
two old parties, and they to-day,
are bright, shining lights in the es
timation of all men who love truth,
justice and honor. Judge Lyman
Trumbull in a speech at Chicago,
on the 6th of October, told the
people in very plain words why he
had left the Democratic party, and
he also told them that it behooved
every man in this country to put
his shoulder to the wheel and save
this country from the certain doom
that now overshadows it. He told
them that the prevailing conditions
were brought about by legislation
which both old parties had aided
in bringing about, and that neither
old party would ever attempt to
overthrow the money power that is
now driving the people into slave
ry as fast as possible.
And in Denver, Co-., on October
12, Alfred Skeels, secretary, and A.
HI. Flood, Treasurer, of the Re
publican league, resigned their po
sitions and severed their connec
tions with the Republican party,
because the national Republican
party did not favor the free coin
age of silver. Let us say to our
friends that the leaven is working,
and it will not do to falter by the
wayside, but come out to the polls
and vote for the Hen. B. W. Bai
ley, who is on the platform of the
party that is pledged to all the re
forms demanded by the people.
Hon. . W. Ogdpm the Man.
The Democratic executive com
mittee of the Fourth Congre~sion
a District met in Shreveport on
Soaurday, the 18th inst., the com
mittee was called to order by the
chairman, Hon. D. C. Scarborough,
and after a few preliminaries Mr.
L. K. Watkidns of Webster, Bled

in Grant parish-as well as whole
sale fraud in Rapides.
A compromise was finally reach
ed by which Mr. Ogden was de
clared the nominee of the party by
a majority of 16f. Now, as to
whether there was or was not fraud
does not concern us any further
than we deplore such a principle,
if the l)emocrats can not have a
fair election in their own household
when they have it all their own
way, it certainly should he a warn
ing to the peol)le to denounce and
put down such a practice by over
whelming majorities at the polls,
voting such a party into ollivion.
The ballot of the American citi
zen is his only safeguard against
tyranny and oppression, it is the
only distinction between a republi
can form of government and a des
potism. Tl'herefore, we say that he
should go to the polls on election
day, and put his seal of condemna
tion upon it. and have the manhood
to see that his ballot is not stolen
from him. Recollect that Mr.
Watkins and Mr. Ogden are both
Democrats, and this charge has
been made in the Democratic party,
and is therefore self accusation
and confession. In conclusion, let
us urge every man to go to the
polls and vote for the People's par
ty candidate, and thereby show to
the world that the wholesale fraud
at the ballot box must stop.
Then Meet Us.
We learn that some of the so
called Democrats have been inti
mating that Mr. Bailey was only a
pine woods school boy. Now to all
such we will make this proposition.
Get any of the most prominent
speakers of the Democratic party
in the Fourth Congressional Dia.
trict, it matters not who he may be,
and Mr. Bailey will meet him on
the stump and discuss the issues of
the day. This is a fair proposition,
do you accept it I
Shows Their Weakness.
The Democrats of the Third Dis
trict made a proposition to the
Republicans to have a joint white
primary in which the names of
their respective candidates were to
be submitted to the white vote of
the district, this as claimed, would
eliminate the negro from politics
as the disturbing element. The
proposition is identically the same
as that submitted to the Democrats
in the Fourth District by the Pop
ulists, and which was rejected by
the Democrats. In regard to the
Republicans rejecting the proposi
tion in the Third District, the Pica
ayune has this to say: "That the
rejection of the proposition by the
Republicans is a confession of
their weakness." If it is thus
construed in the Third District it
canalsobe thus comstrued inthe
Fourth District, and the only con
clusion left is that the Democrats
of the Fourth District were afraid
to risk their chances in the hands
of the intelligent white people.
Another qignifioent fact promi
nently looms up as a further rea
son why the Democrats of the
Fourth District rejected the propo
sition of the Populists, and that is
that it has become very convenient
in the Southern States to have a
blaeck telt to rely upon, that never
fails to roll up a hbig mqority isf/s
er of wAite .premsey. Yet the
Democrats are unceasing in their
attempts to frighten the people
withthe old worn out hobby of
"negro domination," but the bet
ter thinking people have quit ta
king stock in such nonense. First
and foremost, the negro does not
want to "dominate" anybody; and
secondly, he could not if he want
ed to. It is am insult to any white
man to tell him that the time will
ever come when the negro will
dominate the caucasian race.
This old ery of negro domination
is kept up by scheming polItiieios
as a pretext to stuff ballot boxes.
It might have worked eme, bat it
woma't work aies the people have
begun to edeate themselves. The
Demerat ame pet to suchb strailht
-ed eiucmstasm that in ome di.
triot thsy sress to do what they
cder to do in as adjoiniag distriet.
This shows as cmondeuvely that
they uras t heeim in what they
pretend. If as they claimed it was
to the interest of the country to
accept this plroposition in the
Third district, from the anme course
of reasoning, it would have been to
the interest of the country to ac
cept it in the Fourth district. The
terrible doom of inapendiug disso
lution of the Democratic party is
carrying them in a wild career into
positions that are wholly inconsis
tent and irreconcilable.
Democracy vs. Greenbacks.
In the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury for 1888, on page 433,
the following statement may be
found :
'"The $U386,0O00 of greenhacks
iare the weak point in our currency
system. The goki coins and certiti
cates stand first, the national bank
notes next, the silver coins and
certificates third, and the green
backs last in order of assured
value, anud it would be a great ben
efit to the whole mass of the cur
rency if this, its frailest element,
could be eliminated from it.
The present state of things seenm
favorable to the substitution of na
tional bank notes for greenbacks,
and to that end I venture to sub
mit for the consideration of Con
gress the following measures:
1. Funding in bonds the green
back debt of $346,681,016, or so
much of it as may be presented at
the Treasury within a limited per
iod of time, say three years.
2. The bonds to be issued only
to national banks presenting green
backs for that purpose, to bear a
low rate of interest, not exceeding
4 per cent. and to mature only up
on the failure of the bank or upon
its dissolution, whether voluntary
or upon expiration of its corporate
existence.
3. The bonds so issued to be
available only as a deposit to secure
national bank circulation and to
entitle the banks depositing them
to receive circulation notes to the
amount of their face."
The report was made under Mr.
Cleveland's first admiuistration and
doubtless reflects the real senti
ment ot the administration at the
present time. We ask a careful
reading of the above in order to
understand more fully the meaning
of the following extract taken from
a recent letter of Mr. Henry Clews,
a correspondent of Wall street.
He says :
"Wall street is already begin
ning to occupy itself with the pros
pects of the coming Congressional
elections. The main matter around
which interest centres is the cur.
rency question. It is taken for
granted that, that issue must come
up for settlement, even though the
session of Congress be the short
one; and much interest turns on
the question-how far the disposi
tion of the next Congress may be
changed on the currency question.
The possibility that both parties,
owing to party competition, may
bid for the votes of the Populists
is the main canse of any uneasi
ness on this sccount. There has
been no Congressional action to
show very clearly how Congres
sional opinion stands upon the cur
rency issue; but among members
of the house who have been best
situated to form a judgment, there
is strong hope that it may be
found possible to carry through,
before next March, a measure that
will set at rest the silver and fiat
money crazes through putting our
bank currency system upon a
broader and more liberal and yet
absolutely secure basis, and by sub
stituting it for the 500 millions of
government notes which now con
stitate the weak feature of the
monetary system."
We wish to warn the people here
and now that the Democratic party
is expected to destroy the green
back currency daring the present
administration. That party has
destroyed silver and no doubt will
undertake and quite likely aecom
plish the destruction of the peo
ples paper mnoney.-National

Subacribe for the PoluLIsm .
Georgia Election.
Great sensational developments
are followin,, the election ini the
State of Georgia, wholesale fraud,
bribery and btying of votes charg.
ed, and many promineut Demo
crats will be prosecuted. The
frauds committed are shocking in
the extreme and the returns from
s'everal counties have been held
back for the purpose of bringing
out such vote as will be necessary
to give a Democratie majority when
the vote is finally tabulated on the
24th inst., by the general assembly.
The Populist by a fair count
have elected ninety members of the
lowse and twenty Senators. The
Democrats have c·onceded the elec
tion of sixty Representatives and
eleven Senators.
The frauds are so glaring and
outrageous as to disgust the better
element of the people, and it as
sures a triumplImnt stnWcess for the
Populists in 1896k There has been
a gain of about 67,000 Populists in
two years, even taking the D)emo
cratic returns. Look out for the
land slide in 180.t
The Populists had a speaking at
Coushatta on the 10th inst., Maj.
A. L. Cox and Hon. B. W. Bai
ley addressed an audience of about
500. A proposition from the Demo
crats for a joint discussion was ac
cepted. Mr. Bailey opened the
discussion with a half hours talk, in
which he foribly and fluently ex
pounded the demands of his party.
He was followed by J. C. Pugh,
with half an hour, in which he
faunted the bloody shirt and de
rided the Populists for being al
lies of the Republicans. Mr. Pugh
was followed by Mr. J. F. Pierson
with half an hour. He foamed and
stewed over the "wah," something
that has been settled so far as the
people are concerned, for twenty
five years. He also tore his shirt
over the old twaddle of "negro
domination," but he very ingeni
ously omitted to tell the people
that the People's party had offered
to eliminate this question from the
campaign, but the Democrats re
fused the proposition.
It seems that if there is any
chance under the sun to revive the
old reconstruction antipathy be
tween the negro and the white
man, the Democrats are determin
ed to do so by constantly agitating
this question, and the fact that
they have refused to settle it in the
only manner possibie, in evidence
that they have no other object in
view.
The negro of the South is now
settled down to a normal business
condition where they will remain
peaceably and quietly if the Demo
crats will let them. To say the
least of it, such nonsense comes
with bad grace from a party whose
chief executive has appointed neg
roes to high positions. We think
it is time to stop such "balderdash"
unless they at least "show their
faith by their works"
Mr. U. Vincent then closed the
diseussion with a one and a half
hoar talk, in which ne literally tore
the false structure from under the
old Pemocratic hulk, and to the
discomflture of the Democrat
present left the old ship to sink
froim the weight ot its own corrup
tion. Mr. Vincent showed conclu
sively where the Democrats were
equally responsible with the Re
publeans fort the contraction of the
curreacym. We would like to give
_more of his speech, but space will
not admit it.
l aExceeded Thair Epr- an.
Some of the more liberal minded
Democrats after conversing with
Hon. B. W. Bailey, say that he is
not the crank or illiterate person
of whom the People's party is gen
erally sapposed to be composed,
but that he is well posted, intelli
gent and fhuet, and from an intel
lectual standpoint far superior to
the Demoeratie cadidate. Why
not vote ibr him then
A few years ago when the re
form papers said that the contrac
tion of the currency would put cot
ton down to 5 cents, and wheat to
3C5 cenots, they were cslled fools,
cranks and anarchist. We want
to know what you think about it
now.
