The Jeffersonian Savings Bank
Get your boys and girls to do a little work
during the long days of the school vacation,
and show them how to build up a bank account
for themselves.
We will give our full agent’s commission to
every boy and girl who will take subscriptions
for the two Jeffersonians at our regular prices.
We will credit them with the amount and
send them a receipt for it. In the course of
the summer vacation, an active boy or girl can
earn from $25.00 to $50.00 at this work. If
they wish to withdraw the full amount, they
can do so at any time; but if they want to save
it, they can keep on adding to it, little by little,
until it gets to SIOO.OO, when we will give them
a ten year bond, drawing four per cent in
terest.
