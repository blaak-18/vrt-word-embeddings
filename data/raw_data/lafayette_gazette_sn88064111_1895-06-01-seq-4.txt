PRESERVE YOUR GARMENTS.
Hlnts on How to Care for Dree., Gloves, b
Etc. h
It is not half as hard to care for one's
clothes as it is to get them in the first fi
instance. Yet, strangely enough, a
those who have the fewest garments 6
take least pains to preserve their fresh
ness.
Rich women having French maids g
have their gowns and bonnets looked t1
I after with a jealous skill that women
who need such service scarcely dream e
of. h
It is not wear that make a drabbled a
a mass of your best gown an a couple of
months. It is lack of care when it is ofi
your back. If you fold it up or hang
to it, ten to one you do it badly.
Hang all your dress waists and
skirts, but suspend them on "coat
hangers," not on hooks or nails. The
way shopkeepers care for ready-made a
. garments is an excellent object lesson.
I A large supply of coat-hangers can be
bought for a dollar, or, if you are out
of reach of the ready-made article, t
manufacture them. Half a barrel hoop,
with a loop or string in the middle,
makes a satisfactory substitute. Hang- t
ing only serves for stuff or heavy D
fabrics, not when they are of thin o
goods. In that case garments are like
ly to become stringy. Light materials
must be folded, 'sleeves and bows $
stuffed with tissue paper, and all given 1Y
plenty of room. 4
Skirt bags are a luxury, even a neces
sity for handsome garments. They are ot
great square sacks of white cotton,
longer than the skirts, and into which D
the skirt can be slipped without crush- I9
ing. A sachet suspended in the center m
imparts to the skirt a fragrance whicl- E
makes it as sweet and fresh as a flower.
Skirts should not only be brushed
when taken of, but the silk lining
ought to be well wiped with a dry
cloth. This should be done at once,
and the skirt then put away properly.
It  Lmbling about on chairs, waiting ca
to p~sed of, that ruins quantities th
of clothes.
A few pairs of boot trees are invalu- st
able. The cost or them is more than in
compensated for in an actual saving of ap
money. They not only preserve the on
shape, but they crack and break far cc
less. It is a measure of economy to At
keep several pairs of shoes in use.
When worn steadily they do not have
time to dry out thoroughly while off
the feet, and the constant dampness
rots them. Water should never be put ale
on shoes, and any soil should be re
moved. Slippers can be kept stuffed
with paper. il
Gloves must be pulled in shape as dr
soon as they are taken off, and not put tic
away until they are dried. They
should always be removed from the
hand by turning them wrong side out
from the wrist up, not by tugging at
the fingers. In the shops they always en
turn them, as the other method ruins H.
the shape, and it is likely to tear the Ch
The best way to preserve the crisp
ness of veils is by rolling them up in ly
long, narrow sachets made for the pur- er
pose; the tulle is straightened out,
folded, laid on the sachet and rolled
up with it, and the whole tied with a nth
ribbon fastened to.the outside of the I
veil-ease. at
All closets and clothes presses need
frequent sunnings and airings. Cloth- I
ing, too, should be exposed now and
again, just as you sun your bedding.
That is one of the most sweetening '
measures in the world. Dress waist wh
LininRgs can be kept wonderfully nice No
it, in addition, you occasionally wipe A
them oRff with a cloth dampened with m
very weak ammonia water. Of course,

? Speaking of his yearnings for comeli

dn To her I was an Apollo. One day Bill
r's Nye was in my office with me, and my
it little girl came in and began making r

--It was during the Commonwealth a
r that John Playford printed "Ayres a
and Dialogues," a book that comprises I
with many pleasant pieces the first
three that ever were defined by the
word glee, a term that later times 1
have wontedly acknowledged and,
boasted as the designation of a class of a

ing the Commonweath that the same
publisher issued several editions of
"The Dancing Master," each being a li
a variation of the foregoing; and this is n'

1 vation of all the beautiful English
h ballad tunes of earlier date that are,
many of them,not to be found in previ- G
