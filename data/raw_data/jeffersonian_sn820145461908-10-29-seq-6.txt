LETTERS THE PEOPLE
THE NEGRO VOTE.
Baxley, Ga., Oct. 10, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: I believe if the
negro vote is properly handled, much
of it can be turned to you in the
approaching election. They should be
met squarely, and frankly told that
the reason of the disfranchisement
act is because the negro has, as a
rule, cast his ballot with the money
power against the interests of the
common people, including himself,
and thereby been instrumental in de
feating the reforms necessary to lib
eration, the negro, as well as the
white man, is relieved of all his prof
the money power. Explain to the
more intelligent of them the National
Banking System, how, through its op
eration, the negro as well as the
white man is relieved of all his prof
its ?b've the actual cost of living, etc.
And then show them that Tom Wat
son is the best friend they have, that
is in the race for the presidency; and
that the reforms advocated by him
will bring prosperity to the negro as
well as to the white man; that there
could be no law that would help the
white farmer to procure 15 cents for
his cotton and a less price to the ne
gro farmer for his; or $25 per month
for the white farm hand for his labor
and sls per month for the negro
farm hand for his labor, etc. I have
talked privately to a few of the
more intelligent negroes along this
Hine and they seemed to be convinced
that it had been a great mistake on
their part to vote with the money
power against the interest of the
white farmer and white laborer.
This makes me think their vote
might be procured if properly sought
for.
T have written you on another sub
ject; in answering same, please give
me your opinion of the above sugges
tion also.
With best wishes for your success,
I am very truly yours,
11. C. NEWTON.
Ft. Worth, Tex., Sep. 29, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: I want to congratulate
you on your reply to the leprous and
spotted Pettigrew, and an additional
thanks for your consistent and able
defense of the time-honored princi
ples of Jefferson, Jackson and Lin
coln. You are right. Stand brave.
I want to see you, as you deserve, a
successful leader of a solid South for
those principles.
I often think of the amount of
money that was spent to destroy your
influence and defeat you after your
election in 1892 by the same jealous
Brvan followers that are so inconsist
ent and would follow anything under
the modern Democracy —the Bryan
Democracy alterable, modified to suit
the Tim Sullivans in the tenth ward
of New York, whose relations reach
over 70, all of whom furnished and
are assisting funds to debauch elec
tions and conventions in either of the
old parties that will carry out their
own grafting aims and will.
I am informed that Bryan is a
member of the National Reform Ref
erendum League, but opposed the sub-
mission of the prohibition question in
Nebraska and that corroborates your
assertion in reference to his position
on the liquor question in Maine,
Ohio, Minnesota. You are right;
throw it into them. You are our on
ly hope, for they dread you. Hold up
our They will have to come
to us. for you are their school-mas
ter and will surely win.
Yes, Bryan’s position and maneuv
ers in enouraging the negro revolt in
Republican party is sure proof of
what you mention in your public ad
dress to destroy the work of the
South for thirty years. He would
modify and change his position at
any time for an office. God bless you,
our Tnm Watson. You are a hero
and should, as the equal, if not the
superior, of any southern or national
statesman and pariot of the United
States.
want you to be sure and ad
dress the citizens of our state some
appropriate time during the state
fair. I am in correspondence with
Col. Bently, Mollet, Kirkpatrick,
Park, and others, working to that
end.
I am a laborer and have sought and
arranged this opportunity to address
you since reading your public ad
dress and during the entire year, and
want to be honored with a warm rec
ognition by you on a personal call to
the rostrum when you speak.
Mr. Watson, I have asserted that
Bryan, in 1892, defended in a speech
while a member of Congress, legal
tender fiat money, in addition to the
coinage of gold and silver and the
government ownership of railroads,
telegraph and telephone lines. Please
furnish me the date of this, also it is
a fact that he did oppose the sub
mission of the prohibition question.
N. B. I am exceedingly anxious to
get definitely located so I can read
the People’s party paper and Wat
son’s Magazine, for it is worth all
the literature abroad in our land
except the Bible. As lam anxious to
hear from you immediately, I will
await anxiously your early reply to
most ardent and well wishers and
friend.
MARCUS L. MALONE.
Parlier, California, Oct. 10, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Sir and Brother:
I received a letter some time ago
from Carl Browne. I noticed he
signed his name, with others, as
State Committeeman. Now, the fact
of the matter is that he is a self
appointed Committeeman, as are the
others that appear in that letter. I,
being Secretary of the State Com
mittee, knew nothing of his doings
until I received his letter.
He also asked me to accept the
nomination for Representative on
the Hearst ticket in the Congressional
District, —the Sixth —saying I would
have the support of the Hearst papers
and six or seven speakers and could
be elected.
I also received in the same letter
from Browne a letter from the
Hearst party’s Secretary of the State
Committee setting forth the same
request, with fmme promises, J flatly
3eff«rsotilan
refused to have any dealings with any
of them. Browne tried me the second
and third time, but nothing doing.
If the Hearst people had been
honest and wanted reform, they
would not hav » divided the reform
forces, on the same platform, and
thus having two parties in the field,
but would have nominated our ticket
and we could have worked together.
Suppose Hearst should withdraw
from the League, with his press and
paid servants, it would die at once. —
ail depending on just one man. If
Hearst should flop around like W.
J. the Peerless —his party would
die with spasms immediately.
Now the right thing to do is to
keep in the middle of the road and
heed not the voice of politicial
tricksters, but rush this campaign
hard until November 3, and on the 4th
renew our efforts and organize in
every State and county and township.
I will pledge SIOO a year, payable
quarterly, for the support of speak
ers and organizers, to begin immedi
ately after the election. Come, boys !
Send in your names and the amounts
you will give. Let us be up and
doing. Our country demands it. The
future hopes of rising generations
depend upon the success of the Peo
ple’s Party. Let us raise a large
fund to place speakers in the dif
ferent States. Report to the Jef
fersonian the amount you will donate.
Very truly yours,
‘ A. J. JONES,
Secretary P. P. State Committee
California.
Villa Rica, Ga., Oct. 10, R.F.D. 1.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: The Fearless Thos. E.
Watson is gaining ground every day,
and may the time soon come when
the laboring people may realize that
Watson is their friend, and may he
soon walk into the White House.
An ardent supporter,
N. V. STALLINGS.
Talladega, Ala., Oct. 10, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: You have no
idea how much I have enjoyed read
ing your weekly of Oct. Bth. Every
one of them is full of truth and
inspiration for the agricultural
classes; but this one seems to be
just a little better than the others.
The editorial in which you set
forth your determination to make
an effort to unite the South and the
West will bring encouragement to
thousands of honest toilers in these
two sections. There is no reason why
these sections should not unite polit
ically, and thus be able to throw off
the oppression of Wall Street.
Some day the farmers will wake
up to the fact that there is no relief
for them in either of the old polit
ical parties. I wish yon could reach
qyery home in the South and West
with your Jeffersonian. Most farm
ers are honest and will accept the
truth. Os course, some are ignorant
p.n political situation, others
are blinded by political prejudice.
Every honest man knows that you
had rather see justice measured out
to the people than to be President,
but I sincerely hope the people wilj
rise up as a mighty host of co
workers for justice and put Tom
Watson in the White House in
Yours for justice,
A. W. STONE.
Yatesville, Ga., Oct. 13, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: We are wide awake in
this section. Out of sixteen of my
nearest neighbors—all within a mile
of me —twelve are for Watson, and
but four for Bryan. Three to one
for Watson!
How any Georgian can afford to
drop Honora ole Thomas E. Watson,
a native Georgian, and vote for that
W. J. Bryan, who is a thousand miles
away, I can’t understand. The man
who does it ought to be ashamed of
himself. Hurrah for Watson to
carry Georgia!
W. L. HARRIS.
Winona, Miss., Oct. 14, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Kind Sir: I never voted the Popu
list ticket but expect to do so from
now on, for I do not see any relief for
the people in either of the old parties.
I am glad to tell you that many
others are getting their eyes opened,
and I think that by 1912 we will
march a solid front.
We want to make the best showing
possible in this election, for many
of us would not go to the polls at all
if it were not for T. E. W. I, for
one, would stay at home.
I take the Jeffersonian, —don’t see
how I could get along without it, —
and if every man that loves right
would take it, things would not be
like they are.
I am with you. My heart is in
the cause for reform.
I would like to write you a long
letter, but I am so very busy with my
farm work that I cannot, but hope
some time soon to tell you all about
what we are doing in this part of
Mississippi.
I must close by wishing you the
greatest success.
Your sincere friend,
J. F. HERMAN.
IN BEHALF OF DR. S. S.
GAULDEN.
Quitman, Ga., Oct. 11, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: In the last week’s
issue of the 44 Weekly Jeffersonian”
on page ten is published a letter from
Mr. G. B. Crane of Brooks county,
that does both the Quitman Adver
tiser and its creditor, Dr. S. S. Gaul
den, great injustice. Hence we write
you and give you the facts— knowing
that you desire exact justice done
to all: and that you knowingly would
not allow the Weekly Jeffersonian,
which has become such a powerful
factor for good, politically and other
wise, to be a medium through which
any one may do anybody injustice,
much less to a newspaper and an
editor that have dealt so fairly and
differed so courteously with the
Populists, and have —editorially —■
spoken in such exalted terms of you,
the leader of the People’s Party.
The facts are these; Mr. G,
