Scrapbooks are not always desirable _
things. The sticky work copinected "
with them is awkward and trouble- d
some. So readers may like a clipping- p
box, which will prove very useful, as it a
permits one to keep clippings until s
they can be discarded for later ones. c
Buy some good-sized square envel- ,

subjects that interest you have their n

be easily managed. With a carpet
needle prick holes along the two sides
of the box where the ribbon is shown
in the design. Then run the wire
through these holes so as to make it 1
stand out in points inside the box, as
shown in the design. Do you see that I
this wire lining the box on each side
gives a set of brackets down the
length of your box into which the
envelopes are to be slipped?
The disfigurement of the box upon
the outside may be. covered with a
band of ribbon with a rosette bow at
the corner. Ribbon across the top,
too, will be pretty and serve as a
ground for a painted or written in
scription, "Clippings."-Aunt Laurie. I

PRETTY BED SPREADS.
Charming Patterns Which Are Delight
Ing Good Hollsekeepers.
A pretty spread may be made with a
series of squares of linen worked in a
pattern resembling tiles. White linen i
is often used for these spreads. but
quite as pretty are some of the tinted
fabrics so popular now-pale blue,
green or fraise, for example-such as
may be worked with white flax thread
and trimmed with torchon lace and in
sertion. The size of the larger squares 4
depend in great measure upon that of
the spread, and they may be made all
exactly in the same or in different man
ner, according to fancy.
These squares are connected with
bands of insertion, and these are fin
ished with tiny squares of linen em
broidered to match the rest. A deep
frill of lace should be carried round the
edges. Some workers make coverlets
such as this of a series of linen doy
leys, such as may be bought ready
traced at the shops. Instead, too, of
connecting them with bands of insets
tion, a pretty effect may be obtained
by using them alterpately with squares
of drawn threadwbrk. guipure d'art,
or fine crochet. The frill round the
edges, of course, must correspond.
Another pretty bed spread may be
made of a square of tinted linen bor
dered all round with a broad hem
.(about five inches wide) of a second
color. Partly on the center and partly
on the hem should be traced a flowing
pattern to be worked in white flax
thread, and in the center should be
traced a colossal initial or monogram.
Other spreads may be made of cre
tonne, the design being accentuated
and partly filled in with stitches of col
ored silk and perhaps an outlining of
tinsel. Large tassels of parti-colored
threads should be sewn on at interval~
along the sides.-Chicago Mail.
Party Dresses ft.r Girls.
Party dresses for little girls are quite
as attractive as the childish beauties
of the little wearers deserve. Th''l
main idea on which the small maiden's
"party dress" is built is a low-necked,
short-sleeved slip of silk, over which
is draped gauze, tulle. chiffon, or mus
lin, the skirt and bodice being made in
one in the silk slip, the skirt either
made full or flaring. in nine-gored
shape. If there is muslin worn over
this. it is a mass of frills, high in the
neck, the sleeves coming down to the
wrists and the whole enriched with
beautiful needlework. Lace and body
ribbon are also used in the production
of elaborate effects.
Preserving Daby's First Shoes.
A recent fad among young mothers is
to have baby's first shoes made objects
of beauty and sentimental interest
through the agency of some metal
preparation that is poitred over the
Slittle shoe. causing it to retain its
d shape and showing all those dear little
spots and den's, so precious in the
eyes of the fond parent. An enter
prising firm has hit upon this plan, and
from the success they are inaking the
idea proves itself a very popular one.
The slla Hosiery Temptation.
Th.e exquisite elegance of the new
silk hosiery is tempting enough to
bankrupt the most resolute woman's
allowance. Black silk stockingts have
Chantilly lace insertion up the front
and daintily embroidered cream white
ones have lace inserted clocks up the
side, while between these subdued
colors there is every variety of fantas
tic design interwoven in cohr with
black.

It is a well-established 'fact bai of
American housewives are the slaves of ad
conventionality and method if ever le(
women were. What we need is a ae
declaration of independence from this
present cast-iron system that makes us a
all do the same thing on exactly the pr
same day and at the same hour, not be- th
cause we want to, oh no, but be- mi
cause everybody does so we must. fir
Our mothers washed on Monday. ca
ironed on Tuesday, baked and mended
on Vednesday, gave the girl her after- se
noon on Thursday, swept the house on so
Friday and baked on Saturday; bless M,
your heart, it was always done this m
way, and who dares jump the fence? ye
And to forego the big, hot Sunday din- 1
nor would be a heresy from which the
stoutest and most progressive heart
refrains. I know that the time-hon- G
ored prophecy is based on Patrick th
Henry's saying that there was no way th
of judging the future but by the past, 11
but with due respect to that worthy
gentleman, there is a better way, for
where would progress be were that
the principle of life? We should U
be in a continuous round, a cir- -v
cle, a treadmill, from which there Pr
would be no escape; as yesterday sp
was so will to-morrow be. Why er
not select a new way of doing even the P'
old things just for a change if for no M
other motive; it is the same old groove,
or rut, that grinds us down and whit- tI
ties us into the sharp points that we so of
much dread; so then, first of all, let us i
dispense with some of the luxuries, say bi
the big Sunday dinner that entails so T'
much work on the feminine portion of PE
the home, and let us eat that meal re
some other day or if you will have a
big dinner on that day go to the res- no
taurant and give the wife a little, at ti
least, of a different kind of cooking; be
true it may not be savory as the home-. tl
made article, but it will enhance our T
appreciation of that article. Then in- I
stead of burdening our souls on Sun- si
day evening with the query as to ci
whether the washerwoman will come
on the morrow, and the preparations al
for her reception, in the way of getting li
up the tubs and sorting over the soiled "
clothing, why not leave these rites n
until Monday, gather up our clothing al
on that day and wash on the next; if It
not, why not? There are a number of a
things that might be done, but Rome e<

reforms come in a day.--Grace Ter

of celluloid, the whole being fastened

Evolutlon of White Custards.
At a cooking-school lecture, the
e teacher demonstrated the evolution of
s some white custards that should go
â¢down to posterity. They are made as I
s follows: Break the whites of four eggs (
into a small teacupful of granulated
I sugar, mixing thoroughly, but not
beating the eggs. Into this is stirred,
n gradually, a pint and a half of rich
r milk, previously heated thoroughly,
d but neither scalded nor boiled. The
r mixture should be quite smooth before
A being put into the cups; if not, it
Sshould be strained. Place the cups in
Ii a pan of water and cover with thick
y hbrown or buttered paper to prevent
a their coloring. They should be quite 1
I white when done. Bake in amoderate
I oven.
wvas Afraid of the Water.
s An interesting incident of wild beast
life was recently witnessed by a
Stourist in Asotin county, Wash. A deer
. came bounding down the steep sido
sof a bare. rocky hill on the edge of
e Snake river, closely followed by a
Inrge mountain lion. The deer
plunged headlong into the river and
d swam toward the further shore. The
Sbig cat stopped short at the water's
edge, put its paw gingerly into the
water, drew it back and watched the
deer' gain the opposite bank in safety
r and disappear in the woods. Then,
o with a disappointed snarl, the lion
Sslnk away.

Protecting Cottoeeme.
The 1. K. Fairbank Comany of Ohi
cgo have lately brought suit in the United
tes Court against L. Henry, of this
city, for t,0UO.OfU for infringement of their
trade mark "Cottolene." The N. K. Fair
bank Company sets forth that thef origi
nated, prepared, and put upon the market
a new food product onsisting of refined
Cotton Seed Oil and a small proportion of t
Beef Suet, making a palo yellow material of t
the consistency and substance of lard, al
most without odor and intended to take the t
place of lard in cooking. t
In order to indicate the source and gen
nineness of their new food product, ylr
originated, coined, and used as a trade mark
the word "Cottolene." The healthfulness tl
and many other advantages of Cottolene s1
overlard were so apparent that Cottolene ti
became at once very popular and is now n
largely sold all over the country.
The new food product and its name "Cot
tolene" have become widely known as the o
product of The N. K. lairbank Company. p
The trade mark is described as a "trade a
mark for Oleaginous Food BSubstances, o
&c," "consisting of a head or neck of a ci
Steer or other bovine partially enclosed by
sprigs and branches of the Cotton plant."
The N. K. Fairbank Company charges
that W. L. Henry of Macon, Ga., a dealer
in fresh meats and food products generally,
has been and is endeavoring unlawfully to
avail himself of the benefits of the name
"Cottolene" and its popularity; that he has
been and is selling a product similar in kind,
but inferior in quality under the name of
"Cottolene" to the injury of the original t
and genuine "Cottolene," and to the loss
and injury of its manufacthrers The N. K. i
Fairbank Compauy.
The infringements upon the trade mark of 1
"Cottolene" have become so frequent, and
so many dealers are selling an inferior
article and claiming it to be tottolene that
