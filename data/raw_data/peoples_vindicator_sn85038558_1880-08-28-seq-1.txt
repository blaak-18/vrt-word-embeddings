To improve them is aduty- a
We can do it, if we try. a
Let us drop a gentle warunon
By the wayside as we go,
And, perhaps, then gems of kindness
In a careless heart may grow ;
Let our seed be sown at morning,
For the night is drawing aigh;
There's a harvest for the faithful, b
We may share it, if we try.
As the bee is never idle, tl
And the brook is never still; ti
In the pleasant field of labor h
There's a place we all may till.
Then be ready for the Master ;
He is coming, by.and-by :
There are starry crown in glory, Ii

[Thlli t.ot hal been told to the id
children or the Dacotah Indians for t
very m any years, having been hand- d
ed down from generation to genera- a
lion; and it is now listened to by In. t
lian children with as much interest
as it excited in the red-skinned biya b
ant girls of a thouand years ago.] "
On the bank of one of the many e
branches of the Missouri Biver--or e
"Big Muddy," as it in called by the c
Indians in account of the color of i
it water --the re lived a lttle noy t
and a little girl. These children I
were vmt y mall indeed, being no a
bigger than a man's finger, but vry s
handsome, well formed, and also d
quite strong, considering their sele. i
There were no men and women in n
the world at that time, and none of fi
the people who told the story knew fi
how theso two small folk come to be e
living on the banks of the river. a
iomo persons thought than they ti
wlght have been little beavers, or a
little turtles, who were so smart that Ii
they turned into. a boy and a girl; o
but nothing about this is known for r
certain. These small people lived ti
In a tiny lodge near the river, feed- ti
lng upon the berries that grew along r
the shore. These were of great va- e
riety and many delicious flavors. o
There were wild currants, raspher- o
ri gooseberries serviceberries., i
wild plums and gr as, and of moot a
these one was asuficient to make a Ti
meal for both of the children. r
The little girl was very fond of the I
boy, and watched over and tended a
him with great care; She made him p
a tiny bbw from a blade of grass
pith arrows to match and he hunted c
grasshoppera, crickets, butterflies, b
and many other small creatures. She d
then made him a hunting shirt, or a
coat, from the skin of a humming- g
bird, ornamented with brilliant little g
stones and tiny shells found in the b
sand. She loved him so dearly that u
so work was too much when done p
or him. I
One day he was out hunting on b
the prairie; and, feeling tired from ti
an unusually long tramp, he lay f
lown to rest, and soon fell asleep. I
Thbe wind began to rise, after the o
heat of the day ; but this made him a
sleep the sounder, and he knew noth
Ing of the etdm that was threaten. d
Ilg. The clouds rooled over from a
the northwestern horizon like an a'
army of blankets torn and ragged. r
With flashing lightning the thunder* o
god let loose his powers, and peal at- ii
er peal went echoing loudly through d
the eanones, up over hills and down c
into prairies where the quaking asp e
shivered, the willows waved and the ti
tall blue grass rolled as th winds b
passed over like a tempest-to* sea. ii
July the stubborn aloes tb Span. ti
lab bayonet and therloicly pears l
kept their position. But the storm i
as as brief as it was violent, and, a
gradually subsiding, it passed to the ii
southeast, leaving nothing but a
bank of cloues behind the horizon. a
Everything was drenched by the a
heavy rain. Theflowers hung their T
heads, or lay orulhed from the ti
weight of water on their tender pe. u
tale, vainly struggling to rise and re- g
ole that the storm had pased away. r
The sage brush looked more silvery o
than ever, clothed with myriads of h
rin drops, which beaded ts tiny e
eaves. Through all the storm our f
little hero slept, the feathers of his a
hunting-cost wet and fattened by ti
the rain. When the sun came out t
agan and shone upon him it dried
andabriveled this little cot until it
waned and fell off bim like theshell

when she saw the coadltian of his
oat, on whloh she hadlabeoed with !
uch care and love, bshe was very
muob grieved. Bertars onaly made
him moreangry with the sa, anad he t

cold annoy his enemy the msn. At
ast a bright idesabtruok him, and he
t once told it to the girl, 8be was
dellghted, and addmired hblm the d
more or hlis shrewdness. They soon i
put their plansI lnto practiae, and be- I
gal pitlag a rope of gsweam.
This was a great un detdan as
he rope had to be very lone. ma y
mopns came and went before this
rope was finished, and when the
ta-k was completed, the next thing I
to be considered was how tey shoul a
ary or transpeoort it to the place
where the sun rises In the morning.
This question puzzled them greatly,
tor the rope ws very large and has
vy, and the distance was very great.
All the animals at that time were
ry small when compared to the
ileldmouse, which "'wsa then the
largst quadruped In theo whole
od, twice the asize of ay bffalo.

rope was taken off thq mouse and
unwound; then hbe would takeone
end in his mouth and swim to the
ather aide, letting it trail out after
him as he swam. This performance
halL to he repeated many times be
fore the whole rope was landed on
the opposite bank. When this was
done he had to swim across again
and fetch the little pair. seating
them on his forehead.
It was hard work for the mouse, c
butthe little boy encauraged him to
his work by promises of reward and
compliments on his extraordinary
strength. The high. mountalns were t
erossed with great toll, and while
they were on the dry plains the t
travelers sufered for want of water, .
Toe sun had dried up everything,
and it almost seemed as If he under
stood their object, for he poured t
down upon them his hottest rays.
Several changes of the seasons, and
many moons had come and gone be
fore they reached the dense forest
from behind which the sun was ac
customed to rise. They managed to
arrive at this big forest at night, so
that the sun should not see them, t
and then they screened themselves
In the woods, resting there for sev
oral days. When at last they felt I
rested and refreshed they began
their work at nightfall, and the fnt
thing they did was to uneotl the t
rope. The little boy then took one c
end of it in his teeth, and cllmbed up
one of the trees at the extreme edge
of the woods, where he spread it out
in the branches, making loops and C
llip-knots here and there all over,
from one tree to another, until the
rope looked lak an immense net.
Then the moue, finding his services
no longer needed, left them and
wandered far away.
As morning approached, the two I
children quitted the wood,everything i
being In readines, and retired to at
distance to watch the result-of their I
work. lSoon they espied pale light s
gleaming behind the forest and 1
gradually becoming brighter and I
brighter. On came the sun, rolling I
up in all his grandeur and fast ap
proaching the ropes, while two little I
hearts were beating quickly down t
below. In a moment he had reahobed
the network of. rope. and then, be-.
tore he knew it, he was entangled ls
its meshes and found himself thor I
oughly entrapped. What a proud .
moment for our herol! e compared 1
his own size with that of the sun and I
delight seemed beyond bonad as be
and the little girl watbhed the sun t
struggllng to free himself, getting
red with fury and rage, and pouring
out his burning heat onall urroun.s I
log things. The leaves shriveled and I
dropped from the trees, the branches I
could be seen to smoke, the grass I
curled up and withered, and at last I
the forest began to burn as the bhst I
became more lantense. It seemed as I
ifall nature was on tire. The Jyof I
the chtldren sow turned nlato fear.
The elk, deer and buffalo came rush- I
ing out of the woods. The birds air. I
cled, shrieking and. cryinag, and all t
living things seemed wild with- fear.
SAt last the field-mouse called the I
animals together for a consultation 4
as to what was best to be donse.
They held a brief council, for no I
time could be lost. The elk spoke t
up and said that as the mouse had I
gone to such trouble to carry tbshe
rope to entrap the sun he was the t
one who ought to"estham free ftrom
his entanglement. This was i f
erally agreed to, and lidesth d
feld.mouse was the largest animam I
and .had such sharp and streg teeth
that It would be easy for him to gnaw t
through any rope. .
It was gettin hotter and hotter I
something must bet dos quickl . I

then rapidly roe, and everything I

The fact of the little man traplng I
thesuna and auslplg so mauch stI l
chlef proved his suprlority over the .
other animals, and they hv femaed I
bhim ever sies. And aooordingl to I
