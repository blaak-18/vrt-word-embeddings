that the 'town people were pretty i

The meeting wAs called to order e
y Mr. C. O. Mouton; President of
the Busiless item's Aisociation, who I
called Judge AMien to the chair as 1
puassiding ocaism
Julian Mouftn, Esq., was the first
speaker.. EiKpoke in French, an
in that felikitousi style, for which he
is so wet'' known, nakasg mstoag, i
able and conaincing argument .in
favor f the railroad.
Judie'-Alles neat addressed the
meeting. Our reades know what a
in.e, convincing speaker the judge t
is, and4it is safe; to say that, he was
never ip a happier mood. While
conservative it his views, he gave ,
tome cogent reasomat why t rail- 1
road would prove a source ort great
benefit to this commuanity. He ad
vised moderation and conservatism
in our relations with those not yet
agreeing irwith us on ihis measure,
and stated: that you can't drive any
one in supporting :your views, but.
you can convince him by discussion
asand argument. '
Juadge O. M21cataghandled some
figures in a masterly manner, and by
comparison, past and jaresent, -u ade

were listened to attentively.
'Mr.49row Girard .followed. His
remarks were replete with happy
bits and facts, and helped immeasur
ably to boom up the measure.
The last speaker was Mr. E. G.
Voorhies, who in eloquent and
chaste French terms made a strong
appeal to the audience to support
the measure, demonstrating the
great good that wguld follow the
coming of this railroad.
The aeeting.thensadjourned.
There is no questioning thefact
that a very large majority of the
people of the town are aroused to
the importance of this road, and,
will give it a strong support.
IIHOMES AT THE SOUTH.
The South desires both labor and capital
to develop its resournces. It desires persons
to take up their abode in its sunny climae;
to buy its abundant lands and to establish
good and comfortable homes within its rich
domain. It ofers fiducements to the la
border that are very alluring. The govetadrs
of the Southern States have enbe calied to
gether to amet at Richmond in the m6uith of
to serangesome. further plar to attract
emigrants ti their aori Steraates. Perhaps
it woald he well for thiesr to'arst eris tomce

The plain inference, in the above,
that human life in the Southbis more'
unsafe than in any other section
of the country is .made through will
ful misrepresentations or wofal igno
rance in the premises, and reminds
the Gazette most vividly of how the
tables were once turned upon false
accusers.

d-In oseciion of the counetry ispes
there bees. ithin a-few years a
more`- _noticeable -change In the
inetbbde of its agriculture than -i
-own iprogr s itt this section. For
metly all the evergies of the p1
community were directed to the -
duttion of . the two great staples,
cotton and sugar,. amainly the for
lmer, and all the requisites and sup
plies were purchased outright from
abroad and had to be paid for.from
the crop.
That such a system was an unwise
one goev without saying, especially
a country so well iadapted to the
production of every thisig nedful to
the: sustenance of their inhabitants
iandalmals, and in whiph - all - was
hazarded on th success of a single
crop. It is gratifying to. note the
advance which bhas already been
made in this direction, and -know.
that it is constantly being encouraged
cd -. its necessity urged by intel
ligent writers and observers through
ouent the Southern States. -
Diversity of crops shonid always
be'a feature in agriculture, a
while a firmer ought not to under
take to raise everything that he may
by possibility produce on his farm,
he should cease-ti rely on one crop
Ionse At the eery least the far
tiers oF Soutiheisetern . Louisiana
should'produce all the corn, manilk
and butter, bacon, poultry, eggs,
mutton and wool, fruits and vegeta
bles required for use and- consump
tion in their honmes.
A. cane- crop will yield more
money to the cultivator thap cotton;
this fact being fully established, it
won't be long before every town in
the parish will have its central -re
finery.
The kind of a man that old Dio
genes went hunting around with an
antiquated- lantern. was a tman "who
owned up to an assessor every centt
of personal property he possessed.
He never found him, and never will.
Why should Southwe rn Louis
iana farmers pay out annually
thousands of dollars for Kentucky
and Tennessee mules and horses
when good stock can be raised in
this State? This is one - of the con
unidrums of the day.
There is- no questioning thdie fact
that Lafayette parish: offers superior
inducements to the home seekers, as
well as the capitalist. To the firast,
salubrity of climate, a So whose
fertility is not suij issed anywhere,
hospitable people, good schools,
cheap lands, good markets. To the

He had wrecisely the same capital he started
with A hour before, and had distributed 6o
cents worth of liquor through his system in
they way of, dividends.. The whiskey
and - mescal . were gone. They were
no further uie to any body. The visible
supply of exhilarating beverage had been
absolutely diminished to that extent. He had
bought it at the market price. He had paid
for it in cash. He had all his original capi
tal till in his pocket. True, he had contri
buted-the labor of walking back and forth
froI exico to the Texan side,.and rice
vers ,nut that, as he shrewdly decided, was
no-productive labor, as far as the interests
oaf the public were concerned. It earned
nothing, for it added nothing to the supply
of anyt . He might have walked back
and fort until the river ran dry without any
body being better of.
Here was a chanceto get eves with the

the cause of hie nruptly- He. ' walked
back to the Texas side, bought another
drink, got a Meaican dollar in: change, went
bael to the Mexican town, got another drink
and a United States-dollar4. change. He
kept It up all day. I$e kept it up score of
the scalps they tool He kept it up pretty
steadily all that da until. doslng.up time,
and set at it again the next day as soon as he
could see. He waxed enthusiastic overhis
speculation, - giving a war-whoop at every
notch in the stick.
But at lengthh lie got wandering who was
losing all this money. Apparenty not the
her keepers. They were getting.the market
rate for their liquor. Surely not he, for
was holding his own. The problem bothered
