Despite the fact that Atlanta’s
brilliant horse show was in progress,
its other theaters filled with good at
tractions and the excitement of the
State election returns, the Grand
Opera House was filled to the doors
when Hon. Thos. E. Watson came up
on the stage on the evening of the
7th, and many were turned away for
lack of seating capacity.
“Among those present” chanced
to be a goodly bunch of Bryanites,
who had come with the avowed in
tention of scoffing. They started it,
alas! And they got what they de
served. There was nothing in the
nature of disorder, but there was* an
atmosphere of the most intense an
tagonism among the opposition at the
outset, and throughout an equal at
mosphere of intense enthusiasm. The
Bryanites lucklessly drew the speak
er’s fire —and got it. The regular
course of the speech was frequently
interrupted with cpestions from the
“Peerless’ ” benighted supporters
and their humiliation was so com
plete that long before the address
was concluded, you could have raked
the ranks with a fine tooth comb and
found not a man who would have
dared to admit that he had come to
uphold the candidacy of William J.
It may be true that “a man con
vinced against his will is of the same
opinion still” —but the unanswerable
arguments Mr. Watson advanced —
backed by evidence absolutely incon
trovertible —was a revelation which
will never be forgotten.
In away, people are not so greatly
at fault for still clinging to that
greatest of political hypocrites—Win.
J. Bryan for the Southern papers
for very shame are silent on many
of the most vicious of his policies—
things which, if thoroughly under
stood, would cause instant repudia
tion of them among reasoning men.
Blinded by an ancient prejudice, hyp
notized by a name, worshipping an
idol which has degenerated to the
merest clay—the Bryanites have no
recourse than in a dogged determina-

It Was a Glorious Victory
lion to shut their eyes and ears to
all facts derogatory to their leader.
This cannot continue —and will not.
Such a bomb-shell as was exploded
in their ranks last Wednesday night
cannot fail of execution.
Now—a word as to Taft. It cer
tainly should seem that people could
understand why it is unnecessary to
devote much attention to him or the
Republican party. It has been since
its inception the party of plutocracy
and special privilege. It stands for
everything which the ancient Democ
racy fought and which Populism has
always fought, is now fighting and
will continue to fight. But we can’t
fight it with Bryanism. We must
take the middle-of-the-road between
two parties which have come to rep
resent the same things. Bryanism is
but another Taftism, in masquerade.
To expose this conglomerate, mon
grel Democratic machine, made up of
every viciousness in men and princi
ples which the Republican party has
always unbhishingly owned to, is the
purpose of the fight against it.
“My father chastised you with
rods —but I will chastise you - with
•scorpions.” Haven’t the common
people been whipped long enough
with rods of every form of
and does not the gang supporting
Bryan now propose in addition to
that to whip the common WHITE
people with the scorpion of NEGRO
DOMINATION? Isn’t it plain that
as between the Republican party and
the so-called Democratic party the
rank and file has but a choice of
atrocious evils? That there is noth
ing, nothing, NOTHING to be hoped
from Bryan, who is crazed by a desire
to win the presidency at last?
“The most pitiable figure in the
world today is Bryan,” says Gene
Ddbs. And he is right. Not to suf
fer a third defeat —finally to “get
there” by hook, crook, any and every
thing—promising the public plun
derers immunity, promising the ne
groes social equality, promising any
thing to anybody who can help his
(sl)e Ueffersonian
private, personal, inordinate ambition,
He reaches out for the votes of the
labor unions—and sneers at our in
dustrial army—the proudest army the
world ever boasted —as ‘‘ a lot of pub
lic beggars.” He takes as his allies
that nauseating yellow nigger, “Bish
op” Turner, who boasts that his an
cestry came from the a kings of Af
rica,” and who proposes that his pos
terity shall be. the social kings of
America.
Therefore the fight on Bryanism —
in the interests of true and loyal
democracy.
The Ocala platform pointed the
way whereby the people can gain
their rights. It still points it. There
is no other way. Frantic rushing
about, changing platforms every four
years, trying this new scheme and
that one, dropping each when it con
flicts with some trust magnate’s, spe
cial interest, will never accomplish
anything for the 90 per cent of our
people who never had a square deal
and never will get it either under a
Taft or a Bryan, a Parker or a
Roosevelt.
“The laboring men are not playing
politics,” says our friend Gompers
in championing Bryan. No. But
they, as well as the rest of the pro
ducing masses, are being played by
both parties as either chumps"or cow
ards.
“Who are you for anyway, Taft or
Bryan?”'piped up"some idiot in the
audience that night. “For myself
and the South!” flashed Mr. Wat
son —and the crowd went wild.
If only people could see that it is
sheer stupidity to think they must
be for either of the two big parties —
if they would only realize that the
thinking portion of both old parties
is utterly disgusted with Taftism and
Bryanism—and unite to control our
common country for its eternal bet

To the Friends and
Supporters of the
Hon. Thos. TL.
Watson.
Following you will see the correct
form of official ballot for the Novem
ber election.
The most essential work of the fol
lowers and supporters of Mr. Watson
is having tickets placed at every poll
ing precinct in this State, and we ur
gently request all who are interested
to write by return mail for ballots
and to send names of any one that
you know to be interested or in sym
pathy with Mr. Watson. The mat
ter of having our tickets at the polls
is of the greatest importance. Write
at once for tickets and send us, if
you possibly can, some money to help
defray the expenses of mailing, print
ing, etc.
