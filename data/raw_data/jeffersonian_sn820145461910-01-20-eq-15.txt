“Benighted Watson Makes Me Laugh,”
Says Wm. T. Ellis
Thos. E. Watson’s refusal to
meet William T. Ellis, of The Phila
delphia Press, in debate on the sub
ject of Foreign Missions on the
ground that Mr. Ellis is not suffi
ciently well-known, and his nomina
tion of William Jennings Bryan in
his place, has brought forth spicy
statements from Dr. Marion McH.
Hull, chairman of the interdenomi
national committee of Georgia lay
men, and Mr. Ellis himself.
It will bejfecalled that Mr. Watson
has aroused widespread comment by
his criticisms of Foreign Missions
through his paper, The Jeffersonian.
Mr. Watson has stated that he is not
opposed to the principles of Foreign
Missions, but to “the modern inno
vations which have thrown aside the
apostolic model and example.”
Through a committee of laymen a
challenge was issued to Mr. Watson
to meet William T. Ellis, of Phila
delphia. Mr. Watson declined, be
cause, he said, there would be no
glory in “the overthrow of a person
who has no particular reputation.”
He named William Jennings Bryan
as an opponent worthy of his con
sideration, and said he would drop
all business and come to Atlanta to
meet the Nebraskan if he would con
sent to debate on the topic of For
eign Missions.
Here is the statement of the mat
ter made by Dr. Hull as chairman of
the interdenominational committee
of Georgia laymen:
“Mr. Watson was honored by a
challenge to debate with a repre
sentative of the laity of the Georgia
churches. He was not challenged by
Mr. Ellis. The latter was a man of
our choosing; if we are content to
stake our cause on him, Mr. Watson
should be satisfied. His sneer that a
working newspaper man is not up
to the Watson level will not be over
looked by the editors of the State.
The letter from Mr. Ellis, which we
send herewith, seems to indicate to
us that he would be an antagonist
worthy of any foeman’s steel.
“Os course, it is apparent by Mr.
Watson’s plea that he wants to de
bate with Mr. Bryan, that he wants
to divert public’s thought from
the real issue. He would like to mix
politics with this controversy. He
wants to dodge a square meeting of
the facts, for he is perfectly aware
that Mr. Bryan would not debate
with him.
“It is easy enough to go on mak
ing the sort of untrue and mislead
ing statements concerning Foreign
Missions which Mr. Watson has been
making when there is no one to an
swer him. He does well to keep
away from a public debate, where
the men of Georgia could be counted
on to make him play fair. Since he
will not front the facts, of course his
words will no longer have any weight
with fair-minded people.”
What Mr. Ellis Says.
Dr. Hull has received a communi
cation from Mr. Ellis relative to Mr.
Watson’s declination of debate with
him on the score that he was “too
obscure.” While in perfect good na--
ture, it nevertheless is rather a spicy
communication. Mr. Ellis says:
“Knowing the inside of this epi
sode, you have doubtless enjoyed the
humor of it as much as I. Really,
your high and mighty Mr. Watson
should know that you laymen first
asked several ecclesiastical dignita
ries to debate with him, and that
they refused to have anything to do
with him. Os course you would have
to beware of the law of libel in pub
lishing any of the characterizations
of him made by his fellow Georgians.
Then it was that you came to a news
paper man, who persisted in the
charitable view, despite all the warn
ings from Georgia, that the rampa
geous Mr. Watson is a decent fellow,
who has simply been talking out of
abysmal ignorance, and so should be
given a chance to get right, or else
be set right. Now, after you had sol
emnly notified me that you wanted
me to be fully aware of the risk of
scurrilous treatment I ran by getting
down to Watson’s level, for him to
refuse to stoop to my level—it is
really too funny.
“I’ve had to explain, when men
tioning the expected trip to Atlanta
this month, that this Watson who
objects to Foreign Missions is not
the Englishman who wrote ‘The
Woman With a Serpent’s Tongue.’
You know that up in this part of
the country your self-complacent Mr.
Watson does not make very much
noise. He is recalled by close read
ers of the news as a Populist who
was brought into passing prominence
by once being made Mr. Bryan’s run
ning mate. Curiously enough, dur
ing that campaign, while in conver
sation with Mr. Bryan, I recommend
ed to him that he read Watson’s
‘Life of Jefferson,’ of which he had
never heard.
Does Not Fear Watson. ✓
“Despite all of the wordy Mr. Wat- •
son’s deblatterating against missions
•—his shiftiness, sophistries and spe
ciousness—l have held to the convic
tion that at heart he is an honest
man, and in open debate would abide
by the traditions of scholarship and
honor, of which the biographer of the
great Jefferson can not be ignorant.
Even yet, in spite of this palpable at
tempt to dodge a facing of the facts
(for nobody knows better than he
that he would not be honored by Mr.
Bryan in the way he suggests) I
think that your demagogic Mr. Wat
son is not half so black as he has
been painted by some of the Georgia
men who have written me.
“When your message came to me
that your exalted and aristocratic Mr.
Watson had refused to debate with
an ordinary newspaper man, I was

reading Sven Hedin’s new book,
‘Trans-Himalayan Adventures and
Discoveries in Thibet.’ After read
ing your communication, I again
took up the book and turned the
page, where I opportunely came to
these words. Perhaps they are a
sufficient answer to your modest Mr.
Watson:
“ ‘Some young coxcombs, to whom
nothing is sacred, and whose upper
stories are not nearly so well furn
ished as those of the missionaries,
think it good form to treat the lat
ter with contemptuous superiority, to
find fault with them, to sit upon
them in judgment, and pass sen
tence on their work in the service of
Christianity.’ Again, on the same
page Mr. Hedin says—and I wonder
if your eminent Mr. Watson knows
who Sven Hedin is?—‘The more I
get to know about the missionaries,
the more I admire their quiet, un
ceasing and often thankless labors.’
“It was, as you know, wholly from
a missionary motive—the same that
would send me to the Chinese and
Hottentots —that I agreed to go to
Atlanta to meet your benighted Mr.
Watson. I was willing to spare the
time and undergo the expense involv
ed for the sake of serving you, and
a cause of which I have some first
hand knowledge, and of renewing ac
quaintance with many Atlanta men.
I have been rewarded with a hearty
laugh, with no labor involved.
“Faithfully yours,
“WILLIAM T. ELLIS.”
—Atlanta Georgian.
