‘Public Opinion Throughout the Union
WAKE UP!
The people are wont to blame their
publie- servants with dereliction of
duty if they fail to stand up and fight
for what the people think is for their
best interest. But who is really to
blame? The public servant depends
on his constituency to inform him as
to how they want him to vote on any
question. He usually votes as a ma
jority of those who write him urge
him to vote. This fact is well known
by the men of great wealth. Conse
quently when they want their sena
tor or congressman to vote a certain
way, they write him so. They get all
others to do the same. The public
servant confronted with petitions and
letters from part of his constituency
urging certain legislation, votes as
they demand although he may know
that it is not for the best interest of
all the people or a majority of those
he represents. He realizes that these
men who are writing him are men of
influence and that they are watching
him. He knows that if he votes con
trary to their wishes he stands good
chance to lose a number of votes next
election. On the other hand the great
mass of the people seem to be utterly
indifferent as to any pending legis
lation.
It is safe to assert that not one out
of a thousand farmers ever write their
representatives in congress in regard
to legislation that would be of benefit
to the farmer. Very few give time
and attention enough to governmen
tal questions to know what laws are
or are not proposed seeking to ame
liorate the condition of the farmer.
The public servant, knowing that they
care so little as to how he votes and
knowing that the other fellows are
watching him, usually votes with the
wealthier classes as against the inter
est of the masses. For instance, take
the lumber men. Now that tariff re
vision is occupying the attention of
lawmakers, every man interested in
finished lumber is petitioning their
representatives to protect lumber.
The unnumbered millions whom a
low tariff on lumber would benefit sit
still and say nothing. As a conse
quence tariff on lumber will remain
as it is or be raised.
So it is with all other manufactur
ed products. The spinners want cot
ton goods. The vast number of men
who make cotton and the consumer
who wear cotton goods sit still and
neither write or wire their represen
tatives what they want done. The
spinner is wide awake and thorough
ly organized. They demand protection
and get it at the expense of the un
privileged millions.
The hope of the continued freedom
and integrity of this government de-
pends on the a wakening of the masses.
The protests of the people never go
unheeded. Will the sleeping masses
wake up and always be there with the
protest when necessary? If they will
they can rule dead easy.—The Roys
ton Record.
THE COOPER VERDICT.
However opinions may vary as to
the justice of the verdict in the
Cooper trial, we believe the result is
one that will have a wholesome effect
upon the South in rebuking the resort
to arms as a method of settling per
sonal difficulties.
It is at least a cause for satisfac
tion that a jury has been found to
whom the empty rhetoric of the pris
oners’ attorneys was without appeal.
Too often the kind of oratory that
was used in an effort to awaken sym
pathy for the accused men has suc
ceeded in blinding the eyes of juries
to facts, and achieved a favorable ver
dict based on sentiment and emotion.
The defense struck a false note
when it held up Col. Cooper as a par
agon of Southern chivalry. His rec
ord is too much a matter of public
knowledge to allow such a character
ization to go unchallenged. The ideals
of Southern chivalry were themselves
at stake, and would have been sadly
tarnished had an acquittal followed
in response to such a plea.
'Southern chivalry and Southern
honor do not bear the scars of dis
creditable transactions with other peo
ple’s money; neither do they parade
profanity and obscenity in the pres
ence of women. It would have been
better thet and better taste had the
Cooper lawyers made less of this claim
for their clients. The plain and un
cultured men who composed the jury
had clearer views of what is chival
rous and honorable than the learned
advocates gave them credit for.
It is satisfactory, too, that no sup
port has been given to the plea of jus
tification based upon the editorial at
tacks on Cooper by Senator Carmack.
When newspaper criticism of a man
who mixes in politics—even if he hold
no official position—is counted suffi
cient cause for threats against the
editor’s life and actual attack upon
his person with a deadly weapon,
there will be an end to the usefulness
of the press as an exponent of public
opinion and a defender of the popu
lar weal.
The trial has been an unhappy af
fair in many of its phases, but if it
serves to cultivate a more enlight
ened sentiment on the question of car
rying guns, and resorting to unlawful
means in resenting real or fancied
wrong, its value will be worth the ex
perience. It may also teach some
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, April 1,
leading luminaries of the bar that
their antiquated notions of the pecul
iar privilege of blue blood to shoot its
enemies have no longer any standing
as argument in this democratic coun
try.—-Louisville Herald.
WITH CHILDHOOD GONE.
It wouldn’t be much of a world for
me
With childhood only a used-to-be;
It wouldn’t be much of a life to
spend
Were love and laughter of child to
end;
A>dreary road and a lonely way
With childhood gone from the land
of play!
It wouldn’t be much of a dwelling
place
With childhood gone, and its April
grace
Dim and faded, and little feet
With their music lost from the field
and street;
No laughter heard, no fairy born,
No pattering down on the steps of
morn!
It wouldn’t be morning at all, or
noon,
Nor fall or winter, or May or June,
Nor day or night or the even hour,
With no one folding a little flower
Os childhood dream on a mother
breast
While the twilight drifted down to
rest!
It wouldn’t be much of a v,;orld to
me
With never a lightheart on my knee;
And the house would die, and the
doors would rust
And the stairs of morning fall in
dust,
And dawn forget us, and laughter
come
Like ghosts of music on lips grown
dumb!
—Baltimore Sun (Bentztown Bard).
MR. PAYNE’S BILL IS PECULIAR.
It is too early in the tariff revision
campaign to assume that duties have
been reduced by the Payne bill. It
is full of ways that are dark, and the
leader in this respect is no doubt the
section providing for an increase in
duties of 20 per cent for all countries
failing to enter into reciprocal trade
relations with the United States. Only
60 days is allotted to other countries
to get in line for minimum duties. It
is known that Germany, France, Aus
tria-Hungary, Italy and at least a
dozen other governments can not or
will not change their tariff schedules
in 60 days, and the result will be that
at the end of 60 days from the pas
sage of the Payne bill the consumer
will get a dose that will out-Dingley
Dingleyism. About four-fifths of the
country’s imports will pay maximum
rates.
Nor is the maximum-and-minimum
clause the only trick in the Payne bill.
The American market value is to be
come a basis of appraisement, instead
of the foreign market value. This of
itself will increase many duties from
20 to 40 per cent.
But perhaps by far the worst trick
in the bill relates to petroleum. The
only parties concerned are Russia and
the Standard Oil Company. Petrole
um is put on the free list, but a pro
vision is added that if any country
imposes a duty on American oil the
oil of that country when shipped to
the United States shall pay a like
duty. Russia is the only oil-produc
ing country in Europe, and Russia
taxes American oil 175 per cent. The
Standard Oil would therefore be pro
tected by the Payne bill from Russian
competition by a duty of 175 per cent.
The sly hand of Boss Aldrich can be
seen in the provision that runs in fa
vor of his son-in-law.
For ways that are dark the Payne
bill certainly outdoes the Heathen
Chinee of Bret Harte’s poem. These
ways will, however, be fully brought
out in the course of the debate, and
some of them will probably be elimi
nated, notably the proposed “maxi
mum” joker.—Birmingham Age-Her

A COWARD OF CONSCIENCE.
Tired and dusty, the excursion was
returning from the bank holiday trip,
and Simkins, a little bald man with
big ears, overcome with his day of
happiness, dropped off to sleep. In
the hat-rack above, another passenger
had deposited a ferocious crab in a
bucket, and when Simkins went to
sleep the crab woke up, and finding
things dull in the bucket, started ex
ploring. By careful navigation Mr.
Crab reached the edge of the rack, but
the next moment down it fell, alight
ing on Simkins’ shoulder. Not feeling
quite safe it grabbed the voluminous
ear of Simkins to steady itself, and
the passengers held their breath, and
waited for developments. But Sim
kins only shook his head slightly.
“Let go, Eliza,” he murmured. “I
tell you that I have been at the office
all the evening. ’ ’ —Royal Magazine.
