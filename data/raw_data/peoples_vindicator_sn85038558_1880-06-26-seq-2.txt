The Kew Revenue Law.
The New Orleans TIMES says: that,
"the Revenue law adopted by the
last legislature will cause more liti
gation than any legislaltive enact
meat that became a law in this 8tate
within twenty yebrs."
This, we infer, springs from the
assessment of merchandise for sale
on consignment, which the law
bring within the pale of commodi
ties to be asseeeed.
The revenue bill is, however, no
more vigorous in its provisions than
the Constitution, which specifies what
shall be exempted from taxation, and
is emphatic that "none other" ex
emptions shall be made.

Judgl W. A. Seal.
Editor Vindicator-Among the ma
ny names mentioned to succeed Mr.
El in Congress from this Distriot,
there is no one of them that stands
higher than the name that heads
this article. A ripe scholar, a fine
debator, a splendid lawyer, and the
best politically posted man, perhape,
within the boundary of the State-a
gentleman of high-toned honor and
chivalry-the District could not find
a worthier or more eminently quall
fled gentlemen within her llmitq than
Judge W. A. Besy to represent her.
When a portion of the Natchitochee
prisoners were under arrest in New
Orleans, Judge Seay volunteered his
services in their behalf, and would
not receive a cent-unlike all the
other Attorneys, who were paid quite
a large sum. We hope that this one
faeet will be taken into consideration
by the nominating Convention.
