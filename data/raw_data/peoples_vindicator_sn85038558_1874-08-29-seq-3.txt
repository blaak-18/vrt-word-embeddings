They Were Not-There.
When our Parish Convention met
in this city, on the'l5th inst., to enun
ciate their principles and appoint dele
gates to the State Convention, at Bae
ton Rouge, thi several wards of the
parish were called, and, to our utter
astonishment and amasement, wards
5th, 7th and 8th, were not represenb
ed. What is the cause of the reti
cence, the sepineness, the culpable
indifstense of the citisems of those
wards, in times like these Have
they not yet suffered enough from
Radica taxation, rule and rascality,
to nerve them to action ? Do they
wishl the continuance of negro spolia
tion, and of the wholesale robbery
which has been going on for so long,
under color of law'; desire to be
taxed to the last nickel they possess
and see their houses sold over the
heads of their wives and ehildren
and their families turned out to seek
shelter and food in caverns, and on
the wild rootoa o the forest? We think
not, in fact we have a better opinion
of their intelligence and patriotism.
Then, why are they not working at
the pumps, when the ship of State
has been riu upon the breakers, is
creeking at every joint; leaking at
every seam, and threatening inevita
ble destruction to all on board, un
less every passenger is on his feet
and doing his duty ? We hope that
they have not joined the Iron-Grays,
who are anxiously waiting for some
thing to turn up for their especial
benefit. They, certainly, cannot ex
pect to better their fortunes by win
ning the great prize in the lottery,
when they have not taken a ticket.
Louisiana expects every one of her
true sons to do his duty in the com
ing campaign, and save her from im
minent wretebedness and sorrow.
Protect her from such a fate; defend
her to the last breath, sad let it not
be said: "A voice was heard in
Ramah, lamentation and bitter weep
ing: Rachel weeping for her chil
dren, refused to be comforted for her
children, because they were not."
AYOTnER or KELLt.OGe' LIEs.-Last
Monday, two weeks ago,ý'in an inter
view with Messrs. David Pierson and
M. J. Cunningham, in New Orleans,
that man had faithfully promised
those gentlemen that he would make
no appointment of a member of our
Police Jury, in the place of Alfred
Woodward, who refused to accept. He
drew a line with his pencil across
the name, and said, since they could
not agree upon the choice of the fifth
member, that the other four were
sufflicient to legislate for the Parish.
Those gentlemen, under that aesur
ance, e1f New Orleans on the follow

Carpet-Bag Governor.
S.crion 1.-Of Govermors.
Question. What is a modern, car.
pet-bag Governor I
Answer. A pliant tool of the Pres.
ident.
Q. Are you a Governor I
A. I write the word after my name,
Q. Is it by virtue of an election
that you write the word Governor
after your name t
A. I was a candidate, though in.
eligible, but was not elected, not
even legally retdrned as elected, and
am consequently, no real Governor,
but a first class frand, commonly call
ed de facto. Beaten at the ballot box,
my creator fashioned me in his bullet
box.
Q. Ifnot a Governor, what are you I
A. Grant made me what I am, po
litically.
Q. How did he make yonu
A. By a midnight interlocutory or
der, issued by one of his faithful J.ud
ges.
Q. Out of what were you thus made.
A. Out of nothing-that is, .out of
a United States Senator.
Q. Is a United States Senator elig
ible to the o.Me of Governor of Louis.
lana i
A. Lawfully he is not, but Grant is
not under the law ; he made me with
out law and against law. He simply
said "Be Governor," and I was de
facto.
Q. Having made you, does he pre
serve you t
A. Having curiousl fashioned me
in his mind, and the vicegerent's
womb, he wonderfully preserves me
by his almighty arms of precision,
for whi I hope I show him my
gratitude by my daily reports to my
creator's law adviser; by my frequent
raids into the interior of the State
with my army and navy, especially
into a parish that has been named
after him, where I have established a
wholesome fear among the unprotect
ed women and children; and by
other signs and tokens of a truly hum
ble and loyal disposition.
Q. Could you maintain your usurp
ed power with your army and navy,
without the aid of your creator t
A. It would be a hazardous experi
ment, which I should not try.
Q. In case the President determines
to pursue the same policy in regard to
Louisiana that he adopted in the Ark
ansas imbrogliho, what would you do r
A. I would follow the example of
my friend Brooks; pack my bag of
carpet and quietly steal away.
Q. Are you a citizen of Louisiana ?
A. Iam not a bona fide citizen, as I
pretend to be.
Q. Where is your home ?
A. When I have one legally, it is
in the State of Illinois.
Q. Are the people over whom yon
exercise usurped authority aware of
the fact that you are a mere bird of
passage ?
A. They shoald be, for my papers
on Camp street announce my arrival
as a visit ftvt the Governor.
Q. How long do you expect to re
main in Louisiana f
A. Just so long as the adventurers
and renegades retain political control
of the State.
Q. By what means do they expect
to retain thia control I
A, By means of bribery, fraud and
corruption, aided by a rascally regis
tration law, and backed by the power
and patronage of the Federal Govern
men.
: Q. What duties do you perform as
defacto orpretended Governor .
A. Whatever Iam commanded to
do to preserve Loulsiana to the uad
icil party in V6,.
Q. Have you made saqy money saince
you have been dfle f to I.
A. You bet.
Q. How have yeou made it
A. After the foraUlaries of my par
ty-by raking everythg in and so
counting for nothing.
Q, Can youea do so lawfully
A A. Y ; lawfully but not legally.
Q. How ea ou odo that I
A. By dLteating th House ou clerk,
after the adjournment, to pass the
bills necessary to authorise achem es
ofplunder, suoeh as fanding the pub
lie debt at sixty eents on thie; dollar,
or leasing the St. Louis Hotel for
nineteen years at a rental of '$5000 -
per annum ; or gettlbg the akuk:

althoughI am not obligd to give an
answer which would eriminate my
self. I admit that I use by opportuni
tish to acquire Itformation for my prl

Q. Whowas l y lea ected Gov

A. Col. John McEer;y, of Onachita.

A. The Uita Staa Mrrihal and

Q. Hate you courts t
A. I have a flne assortment, war
ranted to run as ordered-well pro
vided with judges, Supreme, Superior
and Inferior-especially the latter.
Q. Have you a good stock of law
officers and advisors?
A. Am in full supply-in fact more
than I need. I have attorneys in gen
eral and pro tern, and assistants in
particular-especially the particular
kind-ready to eat any toad that of
fersor hunt down any citizen who re
sists my usurping rule.
Q. Have you an army and navy t
A. I have my Pretorian guard,
known as the Metropolitan Police,
and several regiments of colored
troops, and a young navy, consisting
of the tin-clad gunboat 'Rebel Skunk.'
Q. Is it lawful for you to keep such
an army and navy in time of peace t
A. It is not lawful, but useful and
needful, which is better.
Q. Why is such a force either use
ful or needful t
A. Without it I could not enforce
obedience tomy usurped power--nor
compel the payment of my forced con
tilbutions.
* Q. Is ybur army and navy ufficient
ly strong to accomplish these objects?
A. They are not; but the people
know that if they resist my mercen
aries, or set them at defiance, as they
did in the parish of St. Martin, my
political master will send his cohorts
to protect thlem.
Q. Will the governors of the other
provinces have armies?
A. A provincial army was to have
been organized in New York, and one
would have been created by Gov.
Sutler, could he have been made a
defacto Governor of Massachusetts
by the new patent interlocautory pro
cess.
SECTION 2-Of Pedplee
Question. What are the people?
Answer. The inhabitants of Louis
iana.
Q. What are they t
A. Mere beasts of burden.
Q. What are they good for f
A. To labor and earn money, apd
pay it over to the tax-gatherers for
the benefit of the "trooly loll."
Q. Have the people of Louisiana
no political rights T
A. None that carpet baggers con
sider themselves bound to respect.
Q. Does not the constitution guar
antee to them certain rights and priv
ileges t
A. These guarantees are only in
tended for those who are loyal and
faithful to my creator.
P. Have the people of Louisiana
no votes in the election of their pub
lic rulers ?
A. None worth counting against
our cross-mark affidavits.
Q.. Have they no voice ?
A. None that we cannot stifle or
suborn.
Q. Have they no feelings f
A. None that we care for.
Q. Have they no money ?
A. None thac we will not have be
fore we are through with them.
Q. Have they no property ?
A. Some of them have a little left,
but we will soon deprive them of it.
Q. Do the }eople give up their
property, in the form of taxes, cheer
fully ?
A. No; but we say so in our pray
ers to Williams.
Q. Who is Williams?!
A. Hie is my creator's right bower
and the ignorer of the people's rights.
Q. In what way does he ignore the
rights of the people ?
A. By sending them word that
Grant's mind is made up; that they
need not come to Washington to even
try to change it; and that the heat
thing they can do is to go to work,
make money for their rulers and let
politics alone.
Q. How do the people receive this
from Williams ?
A. Not kindly. They attribute it
to gross misrepresentation or a wan
ton disregard of their rights. They
sceout the latter clause entirely.
Let every white man see that
he Begisters for the coming elec
tion.
GROWILER.
Dear Growler :
How is it that certain persons will
make a practice, in lhe Fall, to trade
with freedmen for seed cotton which
they well know, they, (the freedmen)
have no authority to sell or take from
the plantations until divisions are
made. Do they not know that they
are helping the freedmen to steal from
the planters ?
Yours trly,
Yes, they know it but toe well, and
they are also known. MIoney is their
sole aim, and they do not eare how
they make it. The Sopreme Court of
thlie8tqts has deeideq, that laborers
upon plantations have really no erop
of their own until division is made.
Those trafekers who bay from them,
before then, subject themselves to be
proaseented for buying goods or chlat
tel. from a person, knowing them to
be stolen, Whilst we are for tefore, it
caned.b etal nleiase e eregulate
these traffickers. There is time for
everything, Mr. Planter!
See that every white man in

Editor Vindicator :
Dear Sir-When I joined the Repabli.
can party of this parish, I did the same
through pure and honest motive. I have
been a strong but honest advocate of the
cause of the Republican party up to the
present time; but learning, a3 I do, that
some hypocritical black wretches have
seen fit to .crculate false rumors in re.
gard to my course, calcm lated to inflame
the minds of the white people of this par
ish against me, I hereby declare that I
no longer althato with the Republican
party. My *hole corse as a member of
the Republican party has been ftr hones
ty and reform, but being overpowered
and butnunmb'red, I have never been
able to accomplish anything in that line,
that I now leave to those remaining in
the party. I shall work earnestly and
faithfully for what I think is to the best
interest of the whole people, regardless
of party affiliation.
Hoping you will do me the favor of
publishing the above so that I may set
myself right before the people.
I am respectfully yours,
JOHN CAUGHLIN, Ja.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemished reputation
for the Unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Misccllaneous reading matter.
It .is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that.is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
conld not be read at any fireside without
objection from the moat fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing iost, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID AND SiSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa.
per itself and not dependent on any ecx
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the S:turday Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in.
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with. each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of Tna
OLDw.T AND THE r us of Family Story
Papers.
