A bIootming mnaiden, swept seventeenl
Few we're her wordls and coy her looks;
Andl yet slte loved wIIe well, I ween.
Long did I woo 'mid hope iand fearl
Miy illy was not li'lhtlyl won
She hid her love and thought it shlnlme
At last mny wehtntse task was (one.
I held her Iliashing in my arms:
And then ily anllishl prize I told
flow she haid promiiseld ong atgo
She'd marry me when she was old.
'liTe lissful days sped quickly on,
And I ldl pledged hier with a ring,
But al ! so much too large I' proved !
.ly love was Mlc'ha tiny thing.
lBut yet she wonld not lave it Ichllalgel.
Though froll her hand it f ott would slip;
.An evil omen. I would say ;
While. shel but laughed w itl joyous lip.
I left nii darling for at splee
As nearer drew the wedding day
"One little week." I said, .land then
I never more nleecl go away."
I left her healthy, blooming bright,
The rosy color in her check
I came to lind her wal and white;
Alas ! that fatal "little week."
"0, till disease, now stay ty heand,

In vain I cried, the touch of deat h
Was oni her, o! any promised wife !
I held her dying, in my arnm ;
The ring till trout her linger cold
Wteping, I took it ; and she breathed :
"I'll marry you wheln I'im old."
She knew not what sheli sa, 1oor' child;
Gone from her was bright reason's ray
But still I keep that ring, and wait
For an eternal weddling day.
MY1 OWN SUICIDtE.
A Very French Story,
I.
I bad resolved to kill myself; there
was no longer any doubt that Amelit
was faithless to mie.
Let me be sure about it-W-,s it
1nelia her name was? To think
that she once held my life, as it were,
in her little hand, and I can't recol
lect, to save my soul, what her name
was.
Anyhow, whoever she had proved
false to me, and, I was very young
ate tae time, I had promptly come to
the resolution to destroy myself.
My first intention was to go and blow
out my brains alt over her stair car
pet, but then I reflected that every
one would know that Henrietta
come to think of it, her name was
Henrietta-had infatuated mue and
turned mly head. "No," said I to
myself, "no scandal, no publicity!
Let me imitate the wounded stag,
which, seeking to hide its fatal hurt,
betakes itself to the most. secret
thickets there to perish far from all
human eyes."
II.
SIn this elegiac disposition I took
the 5:30 tram for Melun, which set
me down juet at dusk withie ia few
steps of the Golden Iaon, ai very
well kept inan with cleman beds and a
capital table.
Wlhat will Monsieur have for sup
per?" said a cnarming lettie mis
tres.*.
"Nothing-supper would be a
mockery. 8how me to my tomb-my
room, I mean."
I retired to my couch, but not to
sleep In my fevered dream I be
theld Victora-I am confident it was
Victoria after all-paeineg, leaning
upon the arm of my hateit rival. I
clutched moaly at his throat and
seized-the iron railing of the bed
rstead, or thle marble slab of the lit
tle table by my bedstead. I rose un*
refreshed, bus what matters that-I
was about to die-ha I ha I to die.
Raving dressed myself I went in
search of a rope, You may think
that when a person wanta to hang
himself nothing is easier than to find
a rope, buth I to hunt tmhe hotel
high anmd low before I could find one.
'What on earth do you want of a
rope, Monsieur ?" tsaid the pretty
mnstress when finallsy she found me
one.
SWith the precious bit of hemp In
my pocket I took my way towards a
thicket not far from the hotel in a
little wood whose paths were famil.
tar to me. There was one lonely and
gloomy copees there where I well
sanew my lifeless body would swing
for weeks ere it was discovered.
III.
Upon the road I thought of Berths
-1i was wrong before; come to think
o it, it was Biertha-and oursed her
with all the bitterness of which my
seooul te apable. I then tested my
cord. It was not sueh an agent ofr
telf.destructlon as I would have
chosen had I had an assortment
from which to make a selection. It
seemed to me both short and not up
Sto my weight. I was annoyed. You
cannot tell how'i trifle like that will
affect a person's temper at ouch a
moment.
A further disappointment was oIn
store for me. On arriving 4t the spot
I had selected in advance I was ifa
greeably surprised to find some one
else there. Au idlvidual, .whose
back only I could iee, was occupied
gible brafnb of ,ny tree..

"I see," said Charles (he had told
me in the course of his painful story
that his name was Charles), "that
your silence justifies me."
"By no means," I tied, (You will
observe that it wouldn't have beenl
dignitled for me to abandon at once
my former position on the subject of
suicide.) "There it nothing what
ever in all that you have told me to
justify you in taking your life. Come
muy friend," said I. becoming really
interested in his case, "come, klt us
reason the mauter out. Why should
you complain because you have been
unfortunate in love ? Don't you
know what the poet says?
'The lot of girls was to deceive
Siuce winter Lirst was snowy.'
Women has been false to their lovers
from all time; women will be false to
their lovers to all time."
But no woman has ever been so
false to her lover as this woman was
to tIo."
"Lots of 'em have."
"No; none could he."
"But I tell you thousands of 'em
have. I know one whose conduct to- l
wards-towards an intimate friend of
mine was- . Why should you t
kill yourself because one pretty wo
man has played you false? Seek
another ont--a prettier one."
"In vain, in vain," he groaned;
"she was the only woman in the
world that I cared for; the nandsom-,
est woman in all Paris, sir."
"Oh, bosh. I know of a hundred
handsomer and more tender than
she ever could be. You may think C
in the first moments of soreness 1
that there are no other women in f
the world, but in a month from now It
you'll be prepared to admit how e
silly It was to entertain such a t
thought." a
YI. a
IlMy eloquence seemed so convinc- r
ing and my position so sound that it t
was a pleasure to me to listen to my- g
self. I went on:
"What good will it do.you to hang
yourself ? Tell me, if you can, what t
useful purpose will be subserved. t
Either the woman has a heart or she l
has not. If she has no heart"- L
"She has none- none." c
"Of course she has none. There- a
fore your death will only be agreea- i
ble to her- will only flatter her. It i
is a big advertisement for a woman u
to have a man kill himself on 'her
account. What will the public say
the boys ? They'll say. 'Charles was
an ass a silly ass.' Yes, ChObarles, a
everybody will say you were a silly t
ass and everybody will be right in t
saying so." I
I waxed eloqueht; in point of fact, i
for some moments it had occurred to o
me that I was arguing my own case, t
pleading for my own life. I heaped a
fact upon fact, added argument to a
argument, with such earnestness and b
closeness of reasonulng that my friend 1
(Cheries at last fell into my arms and
cried, "You are right, you are right
-bid me do whatever you would and b
I will obey you."
"All right," said I~ let us go and t
get some breakfast.'

I brought him back to the Golden tl
Ion,. I was terribly hungry. _
The table at whiho we seated our- d
selves was neatly set, and aided one's o
appetite by its snowy linen, its glit- a
tering glaesware, its golden-brown ,
loaves, its yellow butter. 1
When a thick and juicy steak with ti
potatoes had been served up to us, j
lapping our prisoned nostrils in the
elysium of its appetising odors and a
staining our knioves with its vermnell II
estence, and we had tasted the first *
glass of some remarkabDly particular f
Bordeaux, we were rapturously si- a
lent, but our speaking eyes said d
nay, shouted, "Well, Life isn't such
a bad thing, after all."
'Il 1hadn'tmetyou," saidObarley,
reaching across the table to squeese
may hand.
"If I hadn't met him," I thought,
as I returned hise cokdial grasp,
"It was the most remarkable piece
of lock I ever heard of," he contin
ued; "I don't suppose that a human
being goes through that cops twieein
a month."..
I remainled discreetly silent.
"But, Isay, you know," he went r
on, as if sasuddeu light had flashed a
upon him, "what were you doing.in '
that lonely part of the wood at .that

: a I!t.ercAi.:a' Acouint oir it 0rilii.
'':at I he' air and words of this stir
rI ln e ( '(linlposed in an hour
ty its biilliant youngt author, is
. ni,'li to uit flw; t.h(e story of its
origin has never Ibeen written.
In Jainuatry, 186I, I was in atWq.
c d'aliv, asc a looker.on at the Misst
sipi Stato. , Convention, which pass
(p(s (hod (r ordinante of secession. In the
ittier days of the preceding Decetm
li'r, South Carolingi had initiated
the revolution by "going out of the
Union." Mississsippi was the next
to follow suit. When her convention
met at Jackson the first week in Jan
uary, Hlon. W. 8. Barry was chosen
)resildent of that body, which num
bered auch men as Hon. Walker
BIroolcu, General J. Z. George, Hon.
J. L. Alcorn, Wiley P. Harris, and
others well-known to fame as mem
hers. I recall the deep solemnity
which characterized the proceedings
of that splendid body of gallant
spirlit. They did not rush like mad
nnll, as many suppose, into the
whirlpool of secession-on the other "
hand, the deliberations were calm,
statesmanlike, manly, and dignified, I
indicating that from their sister
States they parted company more in
sorrow than in anger. Quite a num
ber of the members had been elected r
as Union men or CO-operationists,
instructed to counsel a waiting for
the "overt act;" the Southern States,
mieatntime, to enter into a defensive t
league with one another, ready to 0
resist the first open attack by the e
Federal Government upon the pecu
liar institution. The majority, how- n
ever, looked upon this scheme as
utterly impracticable-for, they ar
gued, there will be no opea trespass e
upon our rights ; abolitionism will t
work by slow, insidious agencies, 0
and,-botore we dream of such a re- tl
suit, we shall be bound hand and b
foot. A more dignified, able, patri- r
otic, deliberative and earnest Inves- t
tigation of a great question was 0i
never, fora number of days, more
gravely debated. It was a bitter t
trial to men whose fathers, like C1
themselves, had followed the starry
banner under a new and untried m
standard; it was hard to part com- it
paIny with those splendid memories r
which had become the best portion to
of our country's proud history; and
when, finally, just as twilight fell C
over the State-house on the evening
of January 9th, 1861, and the Pres- o1
ident of the Convention, the vote
having been announced, rose, and bi
slowly unfurled the little blue flag e
with it 3 single red star in the centre, ul
and proclaimed that Misslssippi had hi
"dissolved the political bonds which Cl
had connected tiher" with the Union e
of our fathers; strong men bowed gK
their heads and wept. I shall never
cea.e to recall this, the most solemn
ly impressive scene I have ever wit
nessed!
But I have been led away by these n
memories from the object of my
sketch, the origin of the
"'BONNIE BLUE FLAG."
During the last few days of the
Convention, Harry McCarty, sup- K
ported by a young lady, who accom- D
panied him in his original and se- so
lected songs, was giving a variety of m
entertainments at Angelo's Hall, in
that city, consisting of songs, serious
and comic, dancing, instrumental w
music, &c. On the afternoon- of the
9th of January, Judge Wiley P. liar. p
ris, late Chief Justice, and one of o
the soundest lawyers living, met the b
gifted young Irishman on the street, n
and remarked: ..
"Mac, the Convention will adopt
the ordinance of secession sometime dl
this afternoon, and you will' have a a
large audience this evening. Per- A
min me to oiffer asuggestlon: Why e
can you not compose a song pertl- o
neat to the ocesion ? Give us a
patriotic song-one which shall, per- ri
haps, be universally received as a fa
national air-something soul-stirring di
.nd paoriotic, that imay become as b
immortal as the ordinance itself." d
Young efCarthy cauht the idea bi
at once, retired to his room, and in au
three or four hours was singing, for a
the first time in public, the 'Bonnie d
Blue Flag," to a house crowded to ill
its utmost capacity. And not once, ml
of twice, or thrice only, did :he sing b(
the new song that night; but hewas t
eoresd again and again, twelve or of
fiteen timed at least, until he became th
hoarse from singin~t and the aud- m
lence almost exausted from ap- TI
plaudfing. The scene was one which, b
literalily, mast have been seen to p,
have been appreciated., "
The "dollars of the daddieS" wan a
the currency at that time, and the
audience absolutely showed gold
and silver over the stage. I recall
one gentleman who was seated about
the entre of the ball, near a sup
portinag coimo. and who had evi- pt
dehtly taken oh a little extra trl- m
otilsm beforehand - whose aillity, of
under the excitement of the hour, Jd
was equal to the supremest test. ee
W.rapping his arms and legs about A
the pillar, ihe climbed up until his
head strlo the cellling.
SThe accompaniment on -the piano at
was well executed, and whilst sing- t

sielsts alike hliavi hitherto l;. on Iat

isfactory kind of chronometer which
will approximately measure geologi
cal time and thus give us some clew
to the antiquity of our globe. It is
i therefore worth nothing that Mr.
.Mellard Reade of Liverpool has
lately contributed to the Royal So.
ciety a very suggestive paper, in
which he endeavors to grapple with
the question by employing the lime
stone rocks of the earth's crust as an
index of geological time. Lime
stones have been in course of forma
tion, from the earliest known geo
logical periods, but it would appear
that the latter found strata are more
calcareous than the earlier, and that
there has been a gradually progress
ive increase of calpareens matter.
The very extensive disposition of
carbonate of lime over wide areas of
the ocean bottom at the present day
is sufficiently attested by the recent
soundings of the Challenger. Ac
cording to the author's estimate the I
sedementary crust of the earth is at
least one mile in average actual
thickness, of which probably, one
tenth consists of calcareous matter.
In seeking the origin of this calca
reous matter it is assumed that the a
primitive rocks of the original crust t
were of the nature of gigantic or t
basaltic rocks. By the disintregra- t
tion of such rocks, calcareous and u
other sedementary deposits have p
been formed. The amount of lime R
salts in waters which drain districts t
made up of granite and basalts, is e
found, by the comparison of analy
sis, to be on an average of about A
3.75 part in 100,000 parts. It is fur- t
ther assumed that the excessed areas c
of igneous rocks, taking an average p
throughout all geological time, will a
bear to exposure of. sedementary b
rocks a ratio of one to nine. From I
these and other data, Mr. Reade s"
concludes that the elimination of the G
caleareous matter now found in all
the sedementay strata must have oc. tl
cupied at least 600,000,000 of years. a
This, therefore, represents the mini- 8
mum age of the world. The author
infers that the formation of the Lau
rentian, Cambrian and Silurian stra
ta must have occupied about 200,000,
000 of years; the rel sandstone, the a
c.rboniferous and the poikilitic sys- .
tems another 200,000,090, and all the VI
other strata the remaining 200,000,.
000. Mr. Reade is, therefore led to
believe that geological time has been
enormously in excess of the limits T
urged by certain physicists; that it
has been ample to allow for all the
changes waich, on the hypothesis of
evolution, have occurrea in the or
ganic world.
