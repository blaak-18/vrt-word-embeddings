of it ? If so, take Dr. Miles
Nervine modified as di
rected in pamphlet around
bottle. In addition to the
direct curative properties
it has a soothing effect up
on the nervous system by
which the rheumatic
pains are controlled, and
rest and sleep assured.
It has made many cures
of this painful disease,
some of them after years
of suffering. If it will
cure others why not you.
If your case is compli
cated, write us for advice,

may save you prolonged
suffering.
“I was so crippled that I could
scarcely walk. After having- my shoes
on for an hour or two I could manage
to walk by suffering the pain. Then
I began to have pains all through
my system. My doctor told me I had
an acute attack of inflammatory
rheumatism. I read about Dr. Miles’
Nervine, bought a bottle and I com
menced to get better from the start
and for the past six months have
scarcely any pain, and am able to
walk as well as ever."
