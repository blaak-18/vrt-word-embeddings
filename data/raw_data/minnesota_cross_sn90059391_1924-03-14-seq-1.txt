THE GRAFT-DEVIL
I UNDERSTAND that Municipal
Judge Olson of St. Paul has the
active support of the former

say, “Please, oh, please, from my
friend deliver me”?

Give me a towel; I can’t hold back
the tears when I read the names. A
Minneapolis anti-Johnson immigra
tion bill meeting was addressed by
Judge Pam, (a Chicago Jew); Mayor
Leach, (Minneapolis—H ol d her,
Newt); Fred A. Ossanna, (I smile);
the Reverend J. J. Cleminski, U as "

The politicians, nowadays, sing
with pathetic seriousness, an old, old
song, entitled, “The Taxes et
You If You Don’t Vote For Me.

The campaign manager of Colonel
Leach must be suffering from
glooms—or something, now that he
has learned how enthusiastically (.)
the Minnesota people accepted the
Leach-for-governor boom. It looks
very much as if the boom became a
boomerang somewhere in transit.

The way some people drop the
much-abused nickel in the collection
tray, you’d think that the ushers
were passing around slot machines
rather than giving church goers an
opportunity to do their part in the
support of the Protestant churches.
Many a girl who “sticks up her
nose” at a man in overalls, marries
a white-collared loafer, who early in
troduces her to the wash tub.
Where Protestant ministers era
nhasize Churchianity rather than
Christianity, you find empty pews.

Jake Preus says he wont be candi

Minnesota governor has been feeding
from the public trough a long, long
time Perhaps he has learned that
the people of the Gopher state are
determined in their decision to send
him back into the cruel wor J d , wh
a livelihood must be earned by the
“sweat of the brow. ’
Bishop Joseph F. Berry of Phila
delphia, in addressing the eighty
eighth annual New Jersey Methodist
conference, was reported to have
said that “the Ku Klux Klan has a
very bloody history. We cant help
but wonder what history the bishop
has been reading. Isn’t it possible
that in a moment of absent-minded
ness he permitted a non-Protestant
to slip one over by making him think
that the story of the Spanish Inquisi
tion told all about the Ku Klux
Klan. Investigate the source of your
information, bishop, so you wont go
astray again.

Minnesota Democrats will have

to the national convention meeting
June 24 in New York. It will also

1920 Proportion
Apportionment of delegates will be
based on the vote for James M. Cox
for president in 1920. Each county
will nave three delegates-at-large and
one for each 150 Cox votes, or major
fraction.
All these decisions were made at a
meeting in St. Paul last week, marked
by the expected and inevitable Dem
ocratic “scrap.” The battle came up
over the apportionment. Before it
was finished the committee had shown
a line-up on three propositions, to
wit:
McAdoo and anti-McAdoo.
Joseph Wolf or James A. Craley
for national committeeman.

The Cox vote was taken as a com

shown practically equal strength.and
after some exceedingly plain talk
had been indulged in. Dead embers
of the 1922 campaign were raked, and
the ashes flew all over.

Oh, Well, They

“The Babcock trunk highway sys
tem is a system for the transporta
tion of trunks over the highways.”
You may not believe that state
ment, but a young lady who wanted
to teach some Minnesota children,
did believe it—or else tried to mask
her entire ignorance of the subject
with a wild bluff.
This would-be teacher, whose name
was not announced, took an examina
tion for a teacher’s certificate at the
state capitol recently.
In answer to the question, “Briefly
explain the Babcock trunk highway
system, and give its importance,” she
answered:
“The Babcock trunk highway sys
tem is a system by which trunks or
any kind of baggage may be passed
along the highways without getting
lost or damaged. This is very impor
tant so people can send any kind of
baggage between cities without its
being lost or damaged.
“This increases the rate of travel
along the various highways.”
WRITER OF POLITICAL LETTER
HITS THE POINT IN ST. PAUL
Recently there appeared in The
Pioneer Press, of St. Paul, a contri
bution which is crammed with
thought-provoking statements. Who
ever the writer, A. L. H. may hap
pen to be, we can’t help but-feel that
he has hit the St. Paul political sit
uation square on the head. We are,
therefore, reprinting the letter by
A. L. H. as it appeared in The Pio
neer Press. It follows:
Mr. William' Peter has promis
ed that “St. Paul will not be
smeared with oil this coming sum
mer,” which sounds good. We had
a sufficient quantity last summer
to linger in our memory for a
considerable length of time.
He promises further that our
garbage will also have his close
attention and be collected, oh! so
regularly. I wonder. A candidate
seeking public office is apt to
take himself seriously at times,
even as you and I, and the gulli
ble voters have been taken in by
Mr. Peter’s various promises be
fore, and “just before election,
mother” a candidate seeking pub
lic office is long on promises but
short on execution after election,
and assured of drawing a nice fat
salary for the next two years and
a luxurious city car in which to
haul himself and family around.
When we saw Bill Peter the
other day with a wheelbarrow in
hand, our one thought was, “how
very becoming," and we wonder
ed why so many good men are
misplaced.
We are pleased to know that

Russian-810vakian Church Flies
Native Colors Above Stars
and Stripes
(By TWILIGHT)
On March 2, the Russian-Sloakian
church, corner of Case and Forest
streets, St. Paul, displayed a foreign
flag over the outer door above the
American flag; thus insulting the
flag of the country that gave them
refuge from European tyranny.
The occasion was a special celebra
tion of some kind which took place
at the church. In the afternoon a
parade was held by the foreigners, in
which about 50 people participated.
It is reported by a reliable person
that the foreign flag preceded the
American flag in the parade.

Bill to Arthur, “Never mind, old

ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 1924
CONSTITUTION IS
LAUDED BY JUOSE
OF GOPHER COURT
Justice Royal A. Stone Ad
dresses Engineers’ So
ciety of St. Paul
RECALLS EARLY DAYS
“No Man Should Be Judge of His
Own Case,” Says Supreme
Court Jurist
ST. PAUL, March 10.-The big se
cret of the success of the American
constitution lies in the first element
of its structure; to make a central
government operate directly on the
individual.
This was the thought expressed by
Royal A. Stone, associate justice of
the Minnesota Supreme court, before
members of the Engineers’ Society of
St. Paul at the Athletic club recent
ly. Judge Stone’s subject was “Amer
ican Constitutionalism.”
The speaker pointed out that the
framers of the constitution knew
well the danger of power in human
hands. He termed the document a
piece of wonderful engineering. He
said that seven years had transpired
after the Revolutionary war before
a central government was formed.
“How near we came to absolute
disaster during that time is not real
ized,” he declared. “The Revolution
did not leave a unified nation but 13
separate states. In 1787 the country
was approaching anarchy and public
and private dishonesty was ram
pant.
Courts HeM “Umpires”
Tne constitution, Justice Stone
argued, set up a series of “umpires’
of the government game by creation
of the courts, especially the supreme
court. The charge was made that
judicial power had been usurped and
was dangerous. He made no com
ment on the first but flatly refuted
the second charge.
“So long as congress may pass a
bad law by a majority of one and de
feat a good law by the same major
ity, why not permit the appellate
courts to reach their decisions by a
majority of one?” he asked.
“We are suffering from a violation
of the idea that government ought to
be kept as close to the people as
possible,” said Justice Stone. “If we
keep on multiplying bureaus and
commissions ana other similar bodies
to collect statistics and inquire into
their needs it is only a matter of
time before we will have commis
sions sitting on the kind of foods
that are best for us to eat.
“Should Not Judge Own Acts
“No man should be a judge in his
own case. No congress should act as
judges of its own acts; the same ap
plies to state legislatures and muni
cipal governments,” he said. He de
clared charges that the judicial pow
er of the United States supreme
court had become dangerous was new
being made chiefly by reason of that
body’s recent decision in the child
labor cases. The court had ruled
that the power of separate states to
regulate their own affairs should not
be violated
“That the right of the home owner
is greater than the right of the army
of the United States is an assurance
that the constitution is fundament
ally sound and should serve to make
us grateful that we are citizens of
this great country,” Jstuice Stone
said in closing.

The Washington Post
Calls for Limited
Immigration
(Hunnu of rubllrntton and
Education)
WASHINGTON, 1). C., March 10.
—The Washington Post hits the
nail on the head with an editorial
entitled: “Restrict Immigration."
It is worthy of reproduction and
is as follows:
“It is easy to understand much
of the opposition that is moving
against restrictive immigration,
but it is difficult to understand
how it carries even the slight
weight that it does. Most of that
opposition is to be debited either
to American industrial interests
that in seeking to further their
own would disregard the larger
national interests or to those un
der influence of so-called foreign
votes. No arguments that can be
advanced by exponents of such in
terests or by the subjects of such
influence call for serious consider
ation. The paramount interest in
America is that of the nation as
a whole, and that manifestly
urges increase of restrictions on
alien inflow. As for the foreign
vote, that is an anomaly. Its mere
existence urges against continu
ing the laxity that permitted it to
come into being. The only influ
ence to be considered in the im
migration matter is that exercis
ed by good Americanism, which
last is irreconcilable with ‘fore
ign votes.’ ”

the current school fund totaling
$1,031,650.20 certified for payment to

Last October, a total of $2,163,-

BONUS BILL MAY BE

Basis
(Bureau of Publication and Kdurallon)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 10.—
It is looking more and more like a
soldiers’ bonus bill at this session
of congress. Small cash payments
and paid-up insurance policies will
form the basis of the new bonus bill,
according to word on Capitol Hill to
day among the legislators.
With the approval of the American
Legion .the house ways and means
committee is planning to draft a
bonus bill providing for cash pay
ments only to those veterans who are
entitled to no more <than SSO on the
basis of $1 per day for home service
and sl.2"> a day for service overseas.
It is estimated that this will cost
the treasury about $30,000,000.
The great majority of the veterans,
however, will get insurance policies,
the amounts to be based on their
length of service. The policies will
have a cash loan value.
Representatives of the American
Legion, who have been in conference
with the framers of the new bonus
bill have agreed to drop the land
gift, farm loan aid and vocational
aid features of the bonus legislation
vetoed by President Harding in 1022
and to concentrate their efforts on
the new two-fold plan.
St. Paul Holds
Enthusiastic
Klaveran Meet
(By TWILIGHT)
The largest Klavern attendance In
the history of the Capitol City Klan
was held at the last meeting. And
the old-timers bubbled over with hap
piness. as they saw concrete results
of past hard work.
The prevailing spirit at this meet
ing was not only- satisfactory, but
very contagious. Not a single man
left the Klavern without a greater
determination than he ever had be
fore to put Klankraft directly to the
front in St. Paul. It is generally Ad
mitted that the Klan is needed as
much, if not more, here than in any
other metropolitan community in the
United States.
Many of the old-timers agreed that
things look mighty fine in St. Paul
from the standpoint of Klankraft.
One of the “old” aid-timers said “I
have become absolutely convinced
that our present leadership is in
iecting into the Saintly City Klan
the true spirit of co-operation.” Con
tinuing. he ?aid, “I like the way the
officers are conducting the Klavern
activities. I am with the local field
man in heart' and soul in his efforts
to put our Klan on the right basis.
I am pleased to note that he has al
ready eliminated many things that
were not generally acceptable. Be
lieve me. when I say that. I’m going
to pass the word along an-*! let every
one of my friends know that they
are missing much by not attending
the meetings regularly.”
Then he pointed out discourage
ments he and other old-timers had
faced, and went into detail on some
of the obstacles that have had to be
confronted. At this point the old
timer said, “At last I see the goal
only a short distance away. The Klan
is looming big in the city of my
birth St. Paul, aijd it nukes \y\p
happy.” The old-timer's face bright
ened. His eyes registered anticipa
tion. He drove his right fist into the
palm of his left hand, and prophe
sied, “One of these days we’re going
to march through the streets of St.
Paul, thirty thousand strong, every
man in the parade wearing the re
galia of the In.isible Empire. Won’t
that be a happy day?”
The day is not far distant, and if
the parade doesn’t number 30.000, it
will number 50,000.
Klansmen Visit Church
in North Platte, Neb.
NORTH PLATTE, NSB., March B.
When six robed Klansmen entered
the Christian church here last Sun
day night, and walked down the
aisle, no little excitement was caus
ed.
When they reached the front of the
church, the Klansmen stood in a
semi-circle. They requested that
America be sung by the congregation.
After this the Lord’s prayer was re
peated in concert. They left a dona
tion of s3l with the pastor to be ap
plied to the good work of the church.
This is one of the first times that
Klansmen of this place have made a
public appearance, and much inter
est in the order and the principles
for which it stands has been aroused
by the move.
KLANSMEN VISIT SCHOOL
HUTCHINSON, KAN. Presenting
a Bible and American flag to the
Union Valley school, two and one
half miles east of here, at a recent
evening program, eight Klansmen
received much applause for their
good work. Entering the school, the
knights lined up in the hall while
their leader made the presentation
and delivered a talk on American
ideals.
JUVENILE CASES INCREASE IN FEBRUARY

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., March 3.
Sixty boys and girls filed into a
courtroom at the city hall. With
them went several police matrons,
welfare workers, parents. A group
of detectives followed.
When the 60 cases had been dis
posed of last night, Minneapolis ju
venile courts had completed a re
cord breaking month, 103 cases, 77
boys and 26 girls. In January the
total was 48.
Police records for the last week
showed that boys charged with de

which included:
Highway robbery 2
Grand larceny 9
Burglary 6

aged 15: “Would you hestitate to

“Why, no, I don’t think so. I'm never

by stealing. I’m going to do it.”

WASHINGTON. D C., March
6—The administrative commit
tee of the federal council of
churches (This is a Protestant
organization) is out and out
fighting the proposed immigra
tion bill in this congress, on the
ground that it is a “flagrant vio
lation of accepted principles of
courteous and friendly interna
tional, relations. This organiza
tion has sent an appeal to each
representative and senator re
questing a change in the bPI.
This goes to show how ever some
Protestants are deceived and misled
nowadays on the immigration ques
tion . The letter sent to all members
of Congress was signed by Dr. Charles
S. McFarland, general secretary, and
declares that the clause “proposes to
abrogate the treaty with Japan and
to annul the ‘gentleman’s agreement*
without conference or consultation
with the government of J»pan.” The
fatter enclosed resolttvifrhs tbjecting
to the clause.
Lotos Japan
Dr. Sidney L. Gullick, Secretary of
the commission on international jus
tice and good-will of the federal coun
cil of churches, has also been issuing
statements on the subject in which
he characterizes the immigration bill
as “a wanton affront to Japan.’’
All of this attitude is about the
same as that recently expressed by
Secretary of State Hughes. This fed
eral council of churches even goes
so far as to say that “Japan has done
its part faithfully . Congress has thus
far done its part faithfully. But the
Pacific coast states have not done
their part.”
Is Poor Doctrine
That sort of doctrine is not going
to get very far nowadays with red
blooded 100 per cent Americans. The
people of the Pacific coa’st know this
subject better than does the federal
council of churches, and it’s about
time for all good Americans to stand
together and preserve this country
and its American school system for
Americans. The way to start is to
restrict immigration so that foreign
ers will not come over here with their
world-war-torn dissensions, and inoc
ulate the people of this country with
their foreign ideas and principles to
such an extent that the aliens will
after while be running this govern
ment and this country, or at least
trying to,, which has been their am
bition all the time. Let’s make
America a haven for Americans; ali-»
