OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
WVASHTrGTON D. C., Aug. 31, 1878.
There is no worse sort of party
policy than noiminating candidate for
the Presidency two or three years in
advance. The questions now appar
ently most imnportant may in Itir) he
of little moment. Both in the in
terest of aspiring men anid of the par
ty, names of candidates as candidatec sti
should be kept qlnuict. The caunse of hltr
Hayes, which has disappointed nine
tenths of the Reipullieans, seemis to
have caused them to (onllmuence etly sit
in the work of selection. It heing thi
certain that Hayes canuot tie non- hot
inated and that the intlutince nsnally
exercised by an onugoning :aldniois
tration will not exist with this one to
the party is left to sllhetntiilly Ihe
same candidates it had i, 1 7, . Ap- , t'
parenitlyv, too), th1 s l' llllle- m gi'rs
will dictate the nominiation, for the n1
course of lHayes cannot be said to in
have weakened their influence with Ia
the masses of the people. They will I
not be likely, to select another tian
simply because there is nothing against Si
him. They will inot repeat in I181) all
the folly of 1876i. It is eq',ally sure sig
that none of the Conkling,, Blaines
and other leaders can be nominated, wl
for that would lead to dissension at lo
once. Looking at the subject i,, a Fit
wholly disinterested Imanner it would
now seem that the two men having
the best chances for nomination are of
General Grant and Win. A. Wheeler. in
What chances may occur before 8lo ,
no one can tell, but just now it looks
as if one of thenm must receive the *
nomination. a
Major Burke, General Butler thinks. al
is concealing the truth in his testiuo- sl
ny about the Louisiana bargain. The to
Major is evidently a man with a cool
head, and if lie wished to keep back
something he would do it. The Com
mittee yesterday commenced the ex
amination of one Iorn., wh who was a
Washington telegraphic correspon
dent of Hayes and Hayes' friends in
Ohio during the bargaining here be
tween Burke, Sherman, Matthews
and others.
The Democratic Congressicnal Com
mittee is sendiig f'om this city a
great amount of campaign literature.
Let us hope it will have a good ef t
feet. But the true way to keep pat ty
men faithful, to make converts, and
to promote party success generally.
is to encourage and supiport the local
party papers. Papers whih go daily
or weekly into a ian's house, the
year.around, and than the masses of
documents, however able or convini
cing, which are placed before a voter
in the heat of a campaign. Besides,
no matter how good a speech may be,
is and must in the nature utf things he
made to suit in some particulars and
on some points the views of the pco
ple in the section where it is deliver
ed. On those points equally good
party men in other places may have
directly opposite views. And thus,
the general distribution of works in
jury as well as good. The objection
cannot be made to the papeis, unless
to those of general circulation. Dem
ocrats can do their party no better
service than by seeing that press of
the party well sustained.
So far as reports reach headquar
ters in this city there is everything to
encourage the Democracy as to the
next House of Representatives, It is
also gratifying to know that for tile
last few days the party has adopted
more generally than at first the prac
tice of renominating its tried men.
We want not only a majority in the
House of Representatives after March
4th, but an affective majority.
ALBION.
Major E, A. Burke.
Houma Courier. t
The nominee for the office of State ti
Treasurer, Major E. A. Burke, can- re
not but prove satisfactory to the vo. at
ters of this State ; and we are si.tis- ir
fled that the gentleman is well worth I u
of the honorable distinction to which a
his noble services to this State has ti
entitled him. Major Burke is no a
stranger among us. Nine yeats ago 0t
he earned his daily bread workini G
for one dollar per day ; since then, he it
has walked upon the ladder of rRes
ponsible positions, and to-day, lie is a
brought forth by the Democrats ot p
this State for one of the most respon- d
ble offices of our government. h
His services to the Nicholls govern- fi
ment has won for him the respect ii
and admiration of every patriotic
Louisianian, and to him, more than
any other man, does this great State
owe her delivery from the despotic b
shackles of radical corruptions. His d
name, to-day, stands blight in the a
history of Louisiana, and dear to e
every lover of liberty and true pa- d
triotism. t
To Major Burke, the true friend of t
the poor and the brave protector of s
their rights, we tender our earnest c
support-freely and feat lessly. That a
he will be elected by an overwhelm- i
ing majority is only a question of a f
few months, and we shall feel proud
in the knowlodge that Louisiana has, e
after many years of hard struggles, a b
State Treasurer worthy of the lon e
orable position to which he has been
called, and one ever ready to sacri
fice life itself in the defense of the
rights and liberties of the people of
whom he is one of their noblest cham
pions.
In the bright lexicon of American
youth, there is no such word as fail. A
A man merely becomes embrassed
and compromises with his creditors
for thirty cents.
It is well enough to denounce
tramps and say .they won't accept
position. Just offer one of them the
presidency of a bank once. That
would be a square test.
"There was a vast difference," remark
ed Gladiolus, "between Latimer and this
baked bass we are devouring." "Yes,"
said Hellotrope, "because Latimer was
burned at the stake, and this bass was
turned at the bake." Gladiolus said that
wasn't just what he was going to say,
but he would let it go at that.
A man who fainted at a camp meeting
was sadly disappointed. He expected
that a dozen men would rush up, pull
whiskey flasks out of their pockets and
give him whiskey to revive him. The
flasks were forthcoming, but they did't
contain enough liquor to moisten his
lips. He fainted too late in the day.

"Yes," said a man, as he bent his el
bows to raise the twentieth glass, ' it is
overwork that kills."
