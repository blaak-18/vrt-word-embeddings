PAGE TWO
The “ Half-Cropper”
By Sallie T. Parrish
U)
HE PICTURE of a mountain
eer family, portrayed in the
piece copied on the first page
of the weekly Jeffersonian re-
cently from the Cuthbert Leader, has
many counterparts in South Georgia.
Some people seem to think that near
ly all of Georgia’s very poor, illiter
ate, improvident white people live
among the mountains, but that is a
mistake. There are hundreds, yes,
thousands, of them here in South
Georgia, where as “half-croppers” or
wage-hands they cultivate the land
of the well-to-do farmers. They are
shiftless, indifferent and lazy. As a
rule, they don’t do half so well as
they could do with the chance they
have; yet, in many respects, their
condition is pathetic.
Their position as farm-hands and
tenants usually brings them into
close touch with the better educated,
more progressive class of country
people, but they never learn any
thing from observation. Except in
rare cases, they go on from genera
tion to generation without any im
provement in themselves or in their
way of living. They don’t know how
to keep house, or how to cook pal
atable and healthful food. They
make their pig-pens very near the
house for convenience, and they
usually keep from two to six dogs,
which stay in the house most of the
time. Their treatment of a patient
and care of a sick-room is everything
it ought not to be and nothing that
it should be.
In some respects these people are
less desirable as tenants than ne
groes. They visit about half the
time, and a public dinner they never
miss. Free lemonade is a magnet
that draws them from afar. They
expect the man for whom they are
working to furnish them a team to
do all this going, and if he doesn’t
do it they get considerably “riled.”
And the way they send their chil
dren to school is the exasperation of
the school-teacher. They usually
start them in January and send them
two or three days out of the week
from then “till cotton-choppin’,”
when they are stopped for good.
They stop every time there is any
where to go, or company comes,
which is very often; one day out of
each week to “tend to the baby for
Ma to wash”; sometimes to hoe
fence jambs, pick up trash or “drap”
corn. In this desultory manner
many of them get into the second,
third or fourth grade by the time
they are “big enough to git married”,
and thus escape getting classed with
the illiterates when the census-taker
comes around. Some of them never
go to school at all.
The parents of this class have no
pride or ambition. They look upon
their children as being worth while
only to make life easier for them,
and so put burdens upon them which
children ought not to have to bear.
A girl from one such family went
to school to me once. She was
twelve years old, in the second grade,
and eager to learn. Several
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
days she seemed so tired and sleepy
that she could not study, and said
that she had toted the baby nearly
all night the night before to keep it
from crying. That was four years
ago, and she has been to school one
short term since then. She is now
a slim, sallow, poorly-developed girl
of sixteen. Dulled, hardened, crushed
by the life of toil, privation and lack
of opportunity which she has lived,
her face lost all of its brightness and
eagerness. She is “sparkin’ the
boys” now, and if she is ever the
mother of a daughter she will expect
that daughter at ten or twelve to
begin to take the hardships off her,
just as she did for her mother.
I have sometimes tried to get some
of these people to send their children
to school —tried to show them why
they ought to do it. Some have
said, in effect, “I didn’t have no
lamin’, an’ my children hain’t no
better’n I am.” Others have said, in
effect, “Yes, I shore am a-gwine to
sen’ my young-uns to school; I jes
tol’ Mary Ann las’ week I wus
a-gwine to start in nex’ year an’
make ’em go ever day, rain or shine.
I hain’t able to give ’em nothin’ but
a education, but I’m a-gwine to see
that they git that es I live.” But,
alas! that’s the last of it.
To “git married” is the one event
in the lives of these people, and after
that, there is nothing else to do but
just exist —or get a divorce and mar
ry again. Most of the divorce cases
here come from this class. They
marry early and raise large families.
Their morals are lax. They are
simple-minded and credulous—the
ready dupes of every unprincipled
politician that comes along. They
will buy anything in the world they
can get on time or instalments.
They move almost every year, and
sometimes two or three times a year.
They always think they are going to
do better somewhere else next year,
and the first of “Jinuwery” (Jan
uary) is generally moving-day with
them. Sometimes the roads are al
most blockaded with big wagons
moving them from one farm to an
other.

Some of these wagons present a
picturesque appearance. One that I
saw last winter was piled high with
bedsteads, chairs, bundles of bed
ding, etc.-; and on top of that was a
cotton basket with two geese in it;
a big bundle of broomstraw, waving
around in the wind; two or three
fishing-poles they never forget
them; a man, his wife, four children
in red dresses, and a cat. It is bad
luck to move a cat. I don’t know
whether this family didn’t know that,
or whether they were going to defy
that bit of superstition.
I see no way to reach this class of
people—to educate and uplift them
—except through a compulsory edu
cational law, and personal house-to
house instruction in cleanliness, cook
ing, right living, and so on, and a di
rect effort to arouse and cultivate in
them some pride and aspiration.
They never read anything, and they
are too dull to learn anything from
suggestion.
Some of the preachers say that
some people have their conscience
educated only in spots, and perhaps
they would say that I am one of
them, if they knew that I do not
hesitate to say that these people
right here around me appeal to me
more than the Chinese, the Japanese
or the Koreans.
Many of these people never go to
church at all, and those who do have
only the crudest kind of conception of
Christianity. Aren’t these people just
as deserving of our missionary ef
fort and sympathy as any of the for
eigners? And if I can give but little
to missions, should I not give that at
home, while such conditions exist
right at my door? There is nobody
in the world who needs education,
good clothes and a better knowledge
of how to live more than they do.

Miss Parrish’s picture of the
“half-cropper” and his ways is very
vivid and very true. We are coming
to realize, however, that the condi
tion of these poor people has its basis
often in the actual disease known
professionally as “uncinaria”, and
more popularly as the “hookworm”,
or “lazy” disease. The lack of sani
tation around these miserable homes
is the reason the soil is infected, and
re-infected, with these skin-burrow
ing parasites, which make their way
through the bare feet of the chil
dren and, untreated, multiply in his
body, upon which they prey, until all

life, energy and intelligence is lit
erally sapped. It is hard for many
people to believe this; they are apt
to scoff at it and say: “I know these
folks—it’s just laziness!”
All that is to be known of this
parasite has not yet been determined,
but I explain its effects upon the
“poor whites” of the sort described
by Miss Parrish satisfactorily to my
self by, first, their lack of proper
education in cleanliness; next, the
fact that their food is poor and in
sufficient. Against the drain upon
the blood caused by the presence of
the parasite, there is very little easi
ly digested and absorbed nourishment
to offset it. The stomach, in short,
is given little it can digest, while
only those foods which are digested
in the intestine —the starches and
fats —are, as a rule, used. Instead
of milk, soups, beef-juices, soft
boiled eggs, etc., there is a seldom
varied diet of badly cooked corn
bread, hominy, and hog-meat, with
strong, rank, black coffee, and snuff
and tobacco as “dessert”. No won
der there is developed a morbid ap
petite which goes sometimes so far
as to “eat dirt”.
While the negro lives in the same
region and in about the same way
these whites do, I do not think the
race is so subject to this affection.
They are probably not so readily in
fected, or, being naturally lazy and
stupid, even when in perfect health,
little would be thought of a mere in
crease in a natural lethargy.
So, our Southern people who want
to better conditions must eliminate
this disease as a starter toward
enlightening the victims thereof.
“Compulsory education” will not
work out in the case of a child who
is weak and bloodless from uncinaria.
Fortunately uncinaria is curable,
and under right conditions will stay
cured. It is hard to get the afflicted
to believe, however, that their
trouble is not “malaria”, or some in
definite “misery”. But school-teach
ers, like Miss Parrish, can do infinite
good to their own sections, and to
the entire South, by working in every
way toward the eradication of dis
ease, filth and ignorance among peo
ple who otherwise would be among
“the salt of the earth”. Let us dis
seminate knowledge and teach these
poor people how to become what God
intended they should be.

“Book learning” is a superstruc
ture which must be laid upon the
firm foundation of good health. It is
said that thousands of little children
in the big cities go to school—
hungry! We who feel “faint” if our
luncheon time is neglected too long
can realize how faint and weak and
dull must become a child whose
hunger is never really satisfied from
one day’s end to the other. A child
has not only to support life and
health, but to grow. It needs more
food and better food than does any
adult. At last humanity is beginning
to realize the necessity of looking
after the physical welfare of each pu
pil in the schools; feeding the hun
gry, fitting glasses to weak, defective
