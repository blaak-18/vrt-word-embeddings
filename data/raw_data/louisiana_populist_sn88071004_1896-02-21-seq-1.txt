SCOST OF RAILROADS.
r ALL OF OUR ROADS CAN BE
DUPLICATED
For Three Billion Dollars, Whereas the
Cotlmaales Have "Watered" the Rtock
Up to Te BillUUo Five Hundred Million
Dollars In Order to Rob .he People.
There are in this country 1700 sepa
rate railroad corporations, each with
scores of highly paid officials. Once
in a while they get to fighting each
other, but with the exception of these
rare intervals, they are all the time
conspiring with each other to cheat
the public still more. If some railroad
'hould be too independent to suit them,
and lower its rates, they either crush
it by diverting the trafic, or bribe it
to raise its prices again.
The railroad millionaires have acquir.
ed their great wealth by wrecking one
reed after another to enrich themselves.
The government has taken charge of
the roads they have wrecked, restored
them to prosperity and handed them
back to the wreckers to be wrecked
once more. Such folly 'twere trouble
to fnd.
If the country had built the western
railroads itself, and operated them at
cost, like it does the postoffice, the
west would to-day be more powerful
thanm the east. As it is, the roads have
cost the country more than they are
worth, besides an area of land equal ui
to Fngland, Scotland, Ireland, Den- w
mark, Sweden, Germany and France. se
And after all, the nation has no con- fr
trol over them. The companies rob
the interior settlers of all they pro
duce, and many parts the country cl
is becoming almost a wilderness. 81
The railroads of the United States it
could be built to-day for three billions sI
of dollars, and that Is about what they
cost the companies. But the corpora
tions have watered their stock to the at
tune of seven millions of dollars, so as
to be able to charge higher freight.
They claim that their property has
east them ten billion dollars, and that
they are entitled to charge sufficient to o
return them 6 per cot oen this outlay. in
The result is that the extortionate
"demands of the railroads alone ab
sorb all the pIolts of our entire wheat
and cotton crops in the United States."

Tail twisting and bond feeding at the same time are a little out of harmony.
Pick up your silver, Grove, put the bonds in your pocket, and twist as hard
as you please.-National Blmetallist.
If the doctrine of free, independent,
unlimited coinage of silver at 16 to 1 i
would lead to monometallism, as some
seem to think, why did it not do so
from 1837 to 1873?
It would be about as profitable to
chase the flits of moonshine while
swift flying clouds are passing between
it and the earth, as to keep up with
an old party leader.
The old party leader in congress or
at Washington that has the honesty to
refuse to accept "blandishments," is
an exception to the rule, and deserves at
chromo or blue ribbon.
N. W. Cuney seems to have plenty
of Allison money. That is all there is
in Republican politics in the south- I
getting to be a delegate to the national
nominating convention.
The lines of demarkation between c
the two old parties have so gradually c
converged into such oneness that now a
they stand one in spirit, at least, and i
with but few able to discern it.
"What ever is worth doing is worth r
doing well," is an old saying and will I
hold good in politics as in other affairs, c
therefore, secure a thorough and com
plete orgainzation at every voting box
in the state.
Ben Tillman of South Carolina made
a speech in t1i United States senate in
plain English. He is the boldest man
that has been in that body in twenty
rve years. "Go to 'em senator," the
people will may amen.
The money power, the porchasoable I
press, the cuckoo politicians and the y
corruptionists generally will do battle
against the Peoples party, but they
will not prmsall, for our principles are a
corret ad will win. I
It would seem from present appear
anees that the two factions of the
Texas Democracy will use their stink- .
borns on each other, while all who I
love peace, and want reform will votel
the People's party ticket.a

t, Before the panic of 1893 was brought
1 about by Cleveland and the Bank ring;
e says "Statesmen Three," page 176., the
o value of property was $66,000,000,000,
and our debts $40,000.000,000. After
the panic the total value of all proper
o ty was $30.000,000,000, debts the same,
e loss to debtors $36,000,000,000, gain to
n creditors $36,000,000,000. No wonder
h we have millionaires and paupers.
Our entire system of government is
out of joint. Look at our state affairs.
o Instead of pay as we go, the deficiency
a is piling up, notwithstanding the fact
a that taxes are higher than previously.
We have too many tax-eaters by about
one-half. Official fees and salaries are
too high. The Populists are the only'
people, the only party that proposes
I any change or any relief.
The principles of the People's party
a can only be engrafted into the statutes
y of the country, federal and state, by
strict party organization. Any one
d who claims to be a Populist and re
fuses'to abide the will of the majority
is a disorganizer, and is a more dan
b gerous enemy to the party than the
I bitterest and most unrelenting Demo
crat or Republican.
And in these latter dags came one
George Clark, the sage of Waco, and
he ard up on his hind feet and paw
ed the air muchly at one Dudley, a
Parisite, and there was no peace and
fear abounded throughout the oflcial
e family, and the pie-eater exclaimed:
,Sirs, I pray you, tell me where am I
at!" And all the leaders made no re
s ply, and the pie-eater was sorely vexed,
a yes, be was sad!
y With contraction of the currency
a comes failing prices, falling prices
brings discontent to the employer,
hence a close of business, and the die
charge of his employes. Then under
e consumption follows, and finally the
country, as now, is fooded with hope
less men wandering from pillow to post
seeking employment; and, all this that
a few godless speculators may increase
their gains.
In Texas we have increased taxes
and enlarged defloleaes in lieu of the
sacred promises of Calberson and his
ilk that we should henceforth enjoy a
reduction of the former, while a re
currence of the latter should never
come to pasm! And, surpristngly, the
people believed it! Put not thy lith
,In Democratic promises. They ak.e
fair speeches, are elected to office sad,
behold, the people are again deceived!1
