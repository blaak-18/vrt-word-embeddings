Tile Exodus to alnsa.
Perhaps no peon*e are more ereds
lous, more asily deceived thsa tie
ii recently enfsinchised Colored people
of the South.. They are also the
r. creatures of impulse and readily con
trolled by appeals to their passions.
These facts have been clearly demon
strated by the influencegained among
them, fist, by the unscrupulous car
Spet.bagges, and later, by ambitious
' and unprincipled malawags. This
" hlatter clm, aldhif ,j ai oD iMCO6wUst
Sed politicians and fanatical religion
' lets, have made the result of the late
State eleetion and the overthrow of
r Radiealim In Louisiana, the occasion
d to one more impose upon the cred
e llty sad appeal to .the .passons of
r the colored race. Defeated in their
' shemes, disappointed in their aims,
0 they have assidaouou endeavored to
impress upon the minds of the blacks
that Louisiana was no safe abiding
Splane for them, their stay was fraught
with danger, and a new El Dorado
was open to them within the eonfines
of Kansas. Under thyer manipula.
Slion the exodus began and has steadi.
ly continued towards this new land
s of promise. Natehitohes 'parish has
Ssuffered to some extent from this
Kansas fever, but not as great as in
other parishes.
Without discuseing this subject in
- erfeaso, a few practical ideas on it
P will not be amiss. The colored race
Sas a masre, are natives of the booth,
are adapted to the climate, are agri
c eulterallsta by education, and under.
Sstand the feelings and motives of the
i whites, who, by the way, are more
S friendly disposed towards them than
s any people among whom then pay
•Immigrate. Now they propose to I
Sabandon all these and their homes,
I take up their Penates or household
Gods, and migrate ti an unknown
land, among an unknown people, to I
a cold and inhoedaable climate. Will 1
I the change improve their condition ? W
SWUll the new El Dorado prove a land ,
of milk sad honey to these deluded i
people? We imagine not. They
will Bnd in Kansas an unfriendly peo
r ply-nay, even now at Wyandotte,
where some of these immigrants have
located, inadignation meetings have
been held to drive them forth-they
will discover a severe and rigoroum s
climate, requiring thrift, energy and I
continued iandustry; in order to gain a I
subsistence, (qualities which the maa.
'jority of the race do not poassss) and
other almost insurmountable diicui. I
ties, wkhle only peleveranee, iidom
imitable energy and pluck can over
come. Such being the ease their esoe I

.. The Pell Tax.
r M- . EDITOR-Your advocacy of a
as "Poll Tax" law to meet the anlfrage
questio to coome before the Coeven
tion, and in fact, its almost general
advocacy throughout the State, seems
to to me as guarn, ad el DJmoeratic,
of to speak plainly about it. let, it is a
n .reward for the citizen not to do his
1l duty at the polls. It is true, if this
of could bribe him, he is unworthy to

l, Ing for a corrupt set of politicians to
to wedge in and buy votes. This cane,

ed to abuse them, and bring ruin,
,,not only upon themselves, but the
r" State I think not, and the vast
le mnjority of the colored population,
re and too many free-born white. are
in this very condition. Now, I con
in tend tlhat no man should be allowed
y to vote who does not know what he
o is voting for, and that the vote should
, be moral, so to speak, and not im
moral, in a political sense; that is, it
should be, according to, his ides for
a the good of the State, and not its dis.
o traction. What moral right has
II Blunt and his gang, and the negres
of Tensus and Concordia, ete., to I
vote, hla propose to ruoin the State
d without warning, and go to Kansas.
d Of course, this would not rnle the
y State, but this idea, not fear, not to
better their condition actuates them,
and this is the argument that moves
', them.
e Then, to know what a vote Is cast
e for, there most he an edusltional
qualification. This would inspire the
y citizen to become intelligent; to east
1i a moral vote, the citizen must be pa.
d triotic. I would insert an article in
a time Constitution to meet these views.
