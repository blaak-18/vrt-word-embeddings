NATIONWIDE CEREMONIALS HELD

TELEGRAPHIC ORDER
Fiery Cross Burns During Solemn
Service.
Klans over the entire United States
held appropriate ceremonial services
of mourning in memory of our
stricken Pi Last Saturday at
midnight fiery crosses were ignited
and burned from Atlantic to Pacific,
from Lake of the Woods to the Gulf
of Mexico Klansmen assembled in
every state to pay solemn tribute to
the great American leader who had
answered the call of Death’s angel.
Saturday morning the King Klea
gle for Minnesota received the fol
lowing telegram:
“You will cause every organization
in your state to assemble at twelve
o’clock midnight, August fourth, and
hold solemn ceremony befitting this
occasion, for prayer and spiritual de
votion. You will cause to be burned
a fiery cross in light of which will be
hoisted the American flag at half
mast. Cause entire organization to
enter in silent prayer in tribute or re
spect to our deceased national leader.
You will cause all men who possibly
can to wire Mrs. Harding sympathy.
You will hold absolutely no demon
strations except devotional services
in solemn tribute to Almighty God
from now until after the deceased
President of the United States is in
terred.”
In obedience to this order Klans
men assembled outside of St. Paul as
directed. Sharp •at midnight a large
fiery cross burst into flame. The
moon appeared over the tree tops
and sadly, so it seemed, watched the
mourning sons of America as they
stood with heads bared at the base
of the burning cross. The l wild
hilarity on the opposite shore of the
lake ended suddenly when the cross
illumined the sky. Absolute silence
reigned supreme for several minutes.
Then the Klansmen knelt. A voice
broke the stillness of the midnight
hour. A white robed figure stood,
with outstretched arms and face
turned heavenward offering prayer.
At the close of the prayer the Klans
men assumed a standing position
again. A man in civilian clothes
stepped before the Klansmen assem
bled and spoke of the departed na
tional leader. The speaker was a
National Klan Lecturer from Cin
cinnati, Ohio. He said:
“I have known President Harding
for many years. I knew him as an
editor of a struggling newspaper,
later as a United States senator from
Ohio, and still later as President of
the United States. I have always
known him as a man with a kindly
nature, with a heart as pure as re
BIG PARADE AND
INITIATION AT PARIS
Twenty Thousand Persons Gather at
Illinois City for First Big
Picnic and Initiation.
Paris, 111., July 31.—More than
20,000 persons from all part sof Illi
nois and Indiana gathered here today
to take part in the first annual pic
nis and public initiation to be given
in this city by the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan.
The Edgar county fair grounds
was jammed to its fullest capacity
and at 9:45 a. m. a series of ad
dresses was begun by a number of
well-known speakers who talked at
length on Klancraft.
One of the big features of the night
program was a parade of more than
3,000 Klansmen in full regalit who
marched through the main part of
the city headed by a military band,
the marchers carrying red torches
and American flags. A large fiery
cross burning brightly in each corner
of the courthouse lent splender to
the scene as the Klansmen marched
by.
After the parade a class of more
than 700 at the fair
grounds were naturalized in the ini
tiation ceremonies of the Invisible
Empire.

fined gold, and with a mind of re
markable virility. As the editor from
Marion mounted from a high place
in the affairs of the nation to one
higher, he never lost the common
touch. In his being there was not
one scintilla of artifice, not one iota
of deceit, not one atom of hypocrisy.
President Harding was every inch a
man, a man of ability, a man of
honor, yes, a man of destiny.
“I sincerely feel that the death of
our beloved President marks the pass
ing of a great leader. Our national
loss in the departure of Mr. Harding
is a great one. The nation mourns
and in sorrow Americans seek to
fully realize that President Harding
has passed to the other side the
range, and is wandering in faraway.
Our leader has gone to the land from
whose bourne no traveler returns.”
The speaker’s voice broke.
A hush fell over the assemblage.

IN PDDUC SCHOOLS
National Federation Passes a Reso
lution Declaring in Favor of
Proper Leadership.
Washington, July . 31. Without
naming any particular bill, the Na
tional Federation of Business and
Professional Women have adopted a
set of resolutions pledging their or
ganization to work for a department
of education with a secretary in the
president’s cabinet. This is a prac
tical endorsement of the education
bill (formerly the Towner-Sterling
bill.)
The resolution reads :
“Whereas, a sound education of all
of its people is essential to a vital
and enduring democracy; and
“Whereas, the United States has
provided public schools for eduoa
tin gthe citzens; and
“Whereas, we have declared that a
thorough elementary and high school
education is both desirable and es
sential for a successful career in
business. Therefore be it
“Resolved, That we, the National
Convention of Business and Profes
sional Women’s Clubs declare our
faith in the public schools of this
country, and that we affirm for un
qualified support of fedeiral aid and
federal recognition for public educa
tion without federal interference, in
“Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty”
the lake passed the strains of “Near
er, My God, to Thee.” Against the
hillside the song of sadness echoed.
As the last strains died away the
Klansmen knelt in silent prayer.
Shortly a robed figure arose and ex
tended his arms and prayed:
“May the blessings of our God
wait upon thee and the sun of glory
shine around thy head; may the
gates of plenty, honor, and happi
ness be always open to thee and
thine.
“May no strife disturb thy days,
nor sorrow distress thy nights, and
when death shall summons thy de
parture may the Savior’s blood have
washed thee from all impurities, per
fected thy initiation, and thus pre
pared, enter thou into the Empire In
visible and repose thy soul in per
petual peace.”
“Amen!”
Slowly the Klansmen departed for
their various homes.
any way with state or local control.
Be it further
“Resolved, That we believe that na
tional leadership in education and
the efficient adminstration of the
educational activities of the federal
government demand the creation of
a department of education with a
secretary in the cabinet of the presi
dent.”

HUNDREDS CHEER
GIGANTIC PARADE
California Looms Big on the Ku Klux
Klan Ma£
• |
Stockton, Cal.—More than one mile
of Klansmen, parading with their 50-
piece band and 100 robed horses,
walked the crowded streets of Stock
ton on the morning of the Fourth of
July amid the cheers of more peo
ple than have ever been assembled
in that city. The Klansmen paraded
despite the edict of the! committee
handling the Independence Day cele
bration, which said the Klan could
not be granted the privilege of tak
ing part in the regular parade of the
day.
x Permission Requested.
C. O. Smith, of the local police de
partment, several days before the pa
rade received a visit from a man
who said that he appeared in behalf
of the Ku Klux Klan. He asked the
officer if there was a local law where
by a permit would be required to
march in the parade, and he was re
ferred by the captain to the Fourth
of July committee, with the result
that the Klan was denied the privi
lege of entering the parade or par
ticipating in the celebration. The
discussion ended without one member
stating that all the Klan desired was
the advertising it would receive and
that they had no patriotic reasons,
were not 100 per cent Americans, and
had no right to participate. He made
a motion to the effect that the Klan
should not participate, which was
passed. Several days later this man
received a letter signed by “a 100 per
cent American, a business man, and
a Klansman,” in which he was told
that he “was walking on thin ice”
when he talked in this manner about
an organization of which he knew
nothing. The letter closed by saying
"that if he had a country he should
be loyal to it.
As the parade, which was separate
and distinct from any other part of
the celebration, wound its way
through the streets, the assembled
thousands raised their voices in
cheers and the thrilling line of march
was turned from a mere parade to a
glorious victory.
At the same hour that the various
civic organizations and other fra
ternal orders were lining up for the
general parade the Klansmen quietly
assembled in another part of the city
and as the last of the regular pa
rade turned the corner of one of the
widest streets the escort pf the city
police fell into line and beckoned for
the mounted Klansmen to follow.
Every Klansman wore his official
regalia and each horse was garbed in
a robe. A float banked high with
green fern and flowers depicted the
“Klansman Unmasked” as portrayed
in the picture which appeared in The
Fellowship Forum, issue of March 10.
Six gray horses led by Klansmen
drew the float, which portrayed Uncle
Sam in the robe of a Klansman, held
open by his arms, and showing the
red, white, and blue beneath.
More Could Have Paraded.
It is generally rumored that had
the local Klansmen been given more
time in which to act in co-operation
\vjth outside Klans of other cities
there would have been several thou
sand more in the parade. Many resi
dents of Stockton who are not mem
bers of the Klan organization have
upheld the parade demonstration,
which consisted of a large majority
of citizens and taxpayers who had
been so ignobly denied the privilege
of their constitutional nghts in walk
ing upon the very streets that they
themselves had helped to build.
Others who are not members of the
Klan are said to be searching for
someone who can supply Klan litera
ture 1 , in an effort to learn more of
the ideals of the Ku Klux Klan. The
literature will convince the most
skeptical mind that the white robe
of the Klan organization must be an
undeniable emblem of purity in its
purpose of upholding all that is hon
orable and upright and 100 per cent
American.
ORGANIZATION WOMEN

UAH IN MEETING
AT BIG BASS LAKE
TWENTY FOOT FIERY CROSS
BURNED *
MANY CANDIDATES TAKE OATH
(St. Paul Dispatch.)
A fiery cross 20 feet high burned
Monday night on the hill facing Lit
tle Bass lake, seven miles north of
St. Paul, while at least 100 robed fol
lowers of the Ku Klux Klan and per
haps 400 men in civilian clothes held
a Klan meeting in the hollow close to
the lake.
Elaborate precautions were taken
by those at the meeting to prevent
interruption and maintain secrecy,
according to lake residents who live
across the lake from the scene of the
gathering. The hollow where the
meeting was held is part of the picnic
grounds owned by Charted Chapman,
who also maintains a large bathing
beach on Big Bass lake. Owassa
boulevard runs between the two
lakes. On the Little Bass lake side
the ground slopes up into a steep
hill, making a natural pocket next to
the lake.
Headlights Kept Burning.
On the hill, facing up, according to
the lake residents, was a circle of
parked cars with searchlights burn
ing, while guards were posted at in
tervals along the top of the hill, thus
making it impossible for anyone to
approach the meeting from this side,
unobserved. A similar row of cars
faced the lake, their searchlights be
ing trained so that no boat could ap
proach the shore without being seen.
Deputy Sheriff Frank Robert, who
lives on the opposite shore, was hon
ored with two searchlights constantly
on his house, according to informa
tion received. About half a dozen
boats were on the lake, but little Ac
curate information as to the pro
ceedings could be learned.
Meeting Lasts Two Hours.
The gathering of the Klan began
about 9 P. M. and the meeting lasted
about two hours. A similar meeting
was held July 4, but none of the lake
residents paid much attention to it
then, as it was thought to be merely
a Fourth celebration.
Observers say that many new
members seemed to be taking the
oath of allegiance to the Klan, and
about 2,000 pamphlets were handed
out, to be distributed to gather in
new members.
In addition to the large cross burn
ing on the hilltop, a small cross
burned on a platform in the midst of
the meeting. An American flag was
displayed during proceedings.
ONE THOUSAND TO
BE NATURALIZED
Barbecue Sufficient for Ten Thousand
Planned.
Chattanooga Klan No. 44, Realm
of Tennessee, is inviting all Klans
men to attend the celebration of the
second anpiversary of the chartering
of this Klan which will be held at
Midvale Park, Monday night, August
20. A barbecue sufficient to feed ten
thousand people has been arranged
for. Over a thousand aliens will be
naturalized.
The Atlantic Ocean will be the
background for an impressive Klan
ceremonial which will be staged by
Wilmington Klan, Realm of North
Carolina, at Wrightsville Beach on
August 6. Klansmen will be present
from all parts of the realm.
BLUE EARTH COUNTY
IS AWAKENING FAST
Naturalization Ceremony Is Held at
Mankato, Minn. The people of
Blue Earth county seem to be awak
ening to the fact that an active Klan
is in their midst. A common ques
tion everywhere around here is,
“What do you know about the Ku
Klux Klan?” The movement is be
ing discussed by all classes from
ministers to bootleggers. Especially
do the bootleggers seem unusually
anxious and well may they be.
A rumor goes around today to the
effect that Klansmen met in Mankato
somewhere the other night. Many
insist that a large class of candidates
were naturalized. It is a fact that a
meeting was held and a naturaliza
tion ceremony was staged but more
than that we simply can’t tell at this
time. Anyway that’s saying enough.
KLANSWOMEN ACTIVE
Receives Tremendous Impetus Thru
Meeting of Its Leaders.
The organization of the Wolnen of
the Ku Klux Klan, recognized official
ly as a kindred order by the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, received a tre
mendous impetus through the meet
ing of its leaders at Asheville, N. C.,
July 16-19. The meeting was held at
the same time as the conference of
Grand Dragons and Great Titans.
Mrs. Lula A. Markwell of Little
Rock, Ark., Imperial Commander, and
other leaders of the organization in
the various states were in attend
ance and plans were made to actively
organize in every section of the
country. The women reported dozens
of women’s Klans already formed be
sides the taking over of the chapters
and branches of all the Protestant
Women’s organizations in the United
States with the exception of the
Kamelia.
No woman’s organization which is
controlled or promoted by men is rec
ognized by the Women of the Ku
Klux Klan. The order is composed
entirely of women, and is operated
exclusively by women for women.
No person or individual profits
through its promotion, which is on
Democratic lines, the moneys being
handled through the treasury of the
Women of the Ku Klux Klan.
Headquarters of the Women of the
Ku Klux Klan are at Washington, D.
C., but detailed information regard
ing the organization may be obtained
by writing to Mrs. Lula A. Markwell,
Post Office Box 138, Little Rock, Ark.
KLAN IS BITTERLY FOUGHT
Threats to Break Up Meeting Did
Durant, Okla., where the Klan is
being bitterly fought by un-American
influences, was the scene of a suc
cessful naturalization and parade : last
week. Threats to break up the meet
ing did not materialize. Klansmen
from scores of towns in this -vicinity
were present. The Klan band from
Denison, Tex., led the marchers.
The ceremonies were conducted by
Durant Klan.

Lays Out Enthusiastic Plans for the
Future.
Red Wing, Minn.—At the gather
ing of the Red Wing Elan this week
in regular session a national lecturer
gave an interesting report of Elan

Enthusiastic plans were made here
for further growth and effectiveness.
The Red Wing Klan expects to hold

ROYAL RIDERS
Red-Robe Order is Composed
‘ of Foreign Born Ameri
can Citizens.
Atlanta, Ga., —The Enights of the
Eu Klux Elan have endorsed the Roy
al Riders of the Red Robe, an organi
zation with principles similar to those
of the Elan, and whose membership
is composed of foreign-born Ameri
can citizens who because of their birth
overseas are not eligible to become
Klansmen. The order is' growing
rapidly on the Pacific coast.
The Royal Riders are separate and
distinct from the Elan, but in many
matters have support of the Elan, al
though acting independently.
The principles of the new organi
zation are as follows:
“This is an organization for for
eign-born American citizens who hold
this country and its flag above all
others in the world.
“It is founded upon the principles
of the Christian religion and Protest
antism and has for its object the ed
ucation and uplift of humanity.
“It stands for an absolute and un
qualified allegiance to the Government
and Constitution of the United States
and the enforcement of law and order.
“The protection of our homes, the
perpetuation of our public schools,
free press, free speech, and the sanc
tity of womanhood, and is strongly
opposed to the intermarriage with
any of the colored races; the separa
tion of church and state, and toler
ance in religion.
The l ideals of the Great Master and
a square deal for all regardless of
race, color or religion.
“This organization desires only
those men who are real he-men, who
are willing to play the game with
their brother man, and who can be
depended upon.
This organization is now in nearly
every state in the Union and is here
to stay.

The Ancient Order of Hibernians,

of the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan is
indeed proud to number among its
enemies this gang of Irish gun run
ners.
