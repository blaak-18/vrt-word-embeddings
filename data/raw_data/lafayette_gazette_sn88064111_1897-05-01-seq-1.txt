the discussion of the subjects as
sagned at the last meeting. The
subject "How to Teach English
Grammar," was introduced by
Mr. Philip Martin, who read a very
interesting paper, which brought
forth many practical ideas on the
teaching of grammar in our public
F schools. Mr. Martin's treatise of
his subject showed careful prepara
tion, and his several suggestions
will doubtless find approval with all
practicable educators. The sub
ject having been opened was par
ticipated in by all the teachers
present, in which many good points
were made and bad practices
pointed out.
Manager Trudeau assigned the
tollowing subjects for the next
meeting: For general discussion:
1st, "How to Encourage Reading
F Among Pupils." 2(1d, "What Should
a Teacher do to Keep Abreast of
t His Profession." 3d, "Discussion
I of Leading Articles on Educational
Topics." Regular subject: 1st,
"I-How to Teach Physical Geogra
phy."

THtEY DIDN'T
Register and it is Not Likely They
Will.
Bill Flonoy and another negro
named White called at the registra
tion office Tuesday evening and ex
pressed the wish of registering and
becoming voters under the new
election law. As negroes have not
voted in this parish for several
years, the action of the dusky citi
zens created some surprise and no
little commept at the court-house.
But, Flonoy and White didn't reg
ister. After receiving intelligent
and pertinent answers to questions
propounded to Registrar Martin, they
wisely retraced their steps home
ward. Negroes would do well to think
much before making up their minds
to get back into politics. If The
Gazette is not very much mistaken,
the white people of this parish are
in no humor to be annoyed by ne
gro politicians.
Front Isle des Cannes.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
Corn and cotton planting still
goes on despite the hard clods.
If talk counts for anything there
will be plenty of cotton made this
year and hauled to "King Cotton"
at Scott.
Miss M. Bagnal is progressing
nicely with her school in this
neighborhood. Both pupils and
patrons seem satisfied with her.
We only regret that the public
schools are so soon to close.
We heard that a picnic will be
given by the children of the Isle des
Cannes school. We cannot say
where.
What has become of Oberon and
his scientific letter on farming,

Mrs. Smith, of Rayne, is visiting

F week.
Mrs. Sevene Foreman, of Lafa
yette, is visiting her daughter, Mrs.
F Girard Foreman, this week.
Stock water is drying up fast in
I this neighborhood with the dry
north wind and warm sun, but the
water that is dammed up on the
public road between Mr. Oniel
Foreman's and Mr. Jos. W. Brous
sard's plantation does not dry up
much, and the road is fast becom
ing impassable and should be looked
after by the proper authorities, as
i this is one of the most important
roads in this end of the parish, be
ing the shortest way to the parish
seat.
Right you are, O. C. P., about
the hoodlums of your section, but
you might have added stealing
buggy whips to your accusations as
a minor part of their sport.
Some good detective should at
tend one protracted meeting at
Indian Bayou. We think he could
do almost as much good to the
worshippers with his keen eye as a
minister in propounding God's
truths. Of course, both minister
- and detective would be necessary to
- a successful meeting.

KILLS HIMSELF.
A. C. Poulet, a Prominent Citizen
of Rayne, Commits Suicide.
Mr. A. C. Poulet, aged about 50
years and a Canadian by birth,
committed suicide at his home in
Rayne at half past eight o'clock
yesterday morning. lie used a re
volver and shot himself through the
right ear, dying almost instantly.
On the margin of a newspaper
which was in the room, the follow
ing words were written: "Life is
not worth living. May God for
give my sins and pardon my en
emies."
It appears that Mr. Poulet at
tended to his duties in the morning
as he usually did and no one sus
pected that anything was wrong.
Mr. Poulet was a well-known Re
publican politician, being an appli
cant for the post-office at Rayne.
He was a married man and the
father of several children. For a
number of years he was in the lum
ber business and had been a resi
dent of Rayne twelve or thirteen
years.
Speer-Olivier.
A beautiful home wedding was
solemnized at Royville at x2 o'clock
Thursday. The residence of Dr.
G. W. Scranton, where the marital
ceremony was performed, had been
embellished with some artistic and
dainty decorations. The large par
lors were tastily arranged with moss
and confederate jasmins and the
arch, under which the happy couple
stood when the hymeneal rites
were spoken by Father Chabrier,
was prettily entwined with vines,
ferns and flowers. Exactly at noon
I the bride, Miss Edna Olivier, en
tered the -spacious parlor, and
walked by the side of her father,
Mr. O. Olivier, while Miss May
Scranton played an appropriate
march on the piano.
Mr. Edgar James Speer, the
groom, who awaited near the arch,
met the bride, and Father Chabrier
united them as husband and wife.
The bride was dressed in a traveling
costume of blue and tan cloth,
beautifully trimmed with silk and
chiffon and lace boleros with a neat
hat made to match her splendid
wedding suit.
After the religious ceremony all
I repaired to the dining hall where a
4 sumptuous luncheon was spread
t upon a table laden with innumer
able delicacies and a profusion of
lovely cut flowers.
The newly - wedded pair, ac
t companied by a number of
friends and relatives, were
driven to Broussard where,
after being liberally sprinkled with
the conventional rice, they boarded
the west-bound train for San An
tonio and El Paso where they will
spend some time after which they
will go to Houston, their future
homne.
Mr. and Mrs. Speer were the
recipient of a number of handsome
presents from their friends and
well-wishers here and elsewhere.
The Gazette is pleased to note
that Mr. L. A. Veazey, of New
Iberia, has moved to Lafayette

Lafayette's Progress and t ae
Municipal Election.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
LAFAYETTE, L,, April 29, 1897.-,
A growth, not of the mushroom
variety, a growth not so slow,
either, and a substantial growth,
that is the boast of Lafayette.
On every hand is seen the evi
dence of it. Important manufac
turing industries, new commercial
houses, innumerable residences,
each year, all stand witness to the
healthy development of the town
and suburbs. The splendid water
works and electric light system that
will come into existence at an early
date, now that the question of the
validity of the first bonds issued by
the town has been passed upon by'
the Supreme Court, will mark
another important step in our ad
vancement.
In view of the flattering record
Lafayette has been making of late
years it is all the mere necessary
that its citizens should exercise
calm and mature judgment in mat
ters pertaining to the future up
building of the town. *A single
step backward means a great sacri
fice of vantage-ground, and we can
not afford to take any risk in that
direction. When the general wel
fare is under consideration personal
friendship and individual prefer
ences should yield to that more
weighty obligation of citizenship,
the public interest.
With the past for a safe and open
guide it ought to be possible to
steer clear of a threatening danger.
Every citizen and property-holder
having the true interest of Lafa
yette at heart will surely vote,
Monday, for the municipal ticket
headed by the Hon. C. D. Caffery
for mayor. PROPERTY-HOI.DER.
A RETRACTION.
Carel Volff Says lie Accused
Dr. Boagni of Forgery While
in a Fit of Anger.
A special from Opelousas to the
Times-Democrat says:
The sensation caused by the ar
rest of Dr. Vincent Boagni, the
millionaire banker of this town, on
last Thursday, upon a charge of
"forgery preferred by Carel Wolff, a
merchant, of Washington, La., was
brought to an abrupt climax to-day
by the filing in open court of the
following document:
,"Opelousas, La., April 17, 1897.
""To Whom It May Concern:
"I, Carel Wolff, do hereby de
clare that the affidavit which I
made against Dr. Vincent Boagni,
charging him with having forged
my name to an acknowledgment on
the reverse of a promissory note
signed in solido by me and Jacob
Plonsky to the order of said Dr.
Boagni for $210o,5o, and dated
June 21, 1888, and payable six
months after date, was made in a
fit of angel, and has absolutely no
foundation in fact. The signature
alleged to have been forged is my
true, genuine signature. This
statement and retraction is made
voluntarily and of my own notion,
and for the purpose of repairing,
as far as I can, the injury that has
been done Dr. Boagni by the matk
ing of said affidavit and the publi
cation thereof. And it is my wish
and earnest desire that the state
ment of retraction have as great
circulation and publicity as it is
possible to give it.
*"CAREL W\OI.F ."
As was stated in The Times-De
mocrat's report of the affair, the
charge was not believed by the
people, it appearing improbable
that a man of Dr. Boagni's wealth
and standing would resort to for
gery to obtain money.
Tie day following his a~ Dr.
l3oagni's counsel, E. B. Ilisson
and C. WV. Duroy, asked for a prc
!iminary examination for their
client, avtrring that "he was Inro
cent of the said charge, and they
verily believed that the charge was
made out of pure malice and spite;
that however unfounlded and hiow
eves small the chance that any one
in the parish would believe the ac
ciisation, he desired to h,,e the
imputation removed from his gv,,d
name by as speedy a judicial inve:;
tigation as it wat possible to get."
The exaumination was, tlhcrefore,'
set for the 29th instant, which,
however, will not he held in view
of the retraction of \Volfl.

A Rensini:cence.
Daily States.
A few days ago, in an obituary
of our old and honored friend,
General Eugene Waggaman, we
mentioned a number of brilliant
men with whom he was associated
when we first came to New Orleans.
There were one or two errors and
several omissions in that List which,
since it was an histocric group of
Democrats, we should like to pre
sent It as nearly accurate as possi
ble after a lapse of twenty years.
At the time referred to, General
Nicholls was not in New Orlens,
but was an honored citizen of the
parish of Ascen-ion. Among those
we neglected to mention in the list
was Hon. E. John Ellis, one of the
most brilliant men of his day, not
second-as an orator even to Robert
G. Ingersoll. Then there was
Robert H. Marr, who was subse
quently judge of the Criminal
Court; T. C. W. Ellis, brother of
E. John, and now judge of the Civil
Distrsct Court; that knightly gentle
man and rock-ribbed Democrat,
John McEnery, then defacto Gov
ernor of Louisiana. There were
also I)r. Warren Stone, Jr.; Colonel
Adolph Chalaron, one of the brav
est of the brave; Mayor Ed. Austin,
famous for his intrepidity on the
field of battle; Alfred Roman, sub
sequently ,judge of the Criminal
District Court, and author of the
Memories of General Beauregard,
and General Beauregard himself
These are the chivalrous and bril
liant men who, as we remarked,
dom' ated the Democratic patty of
ltitiE. They- certainly wielded a
great poPer: atihd ruled with a strong
hand. They did not constitute a
political Ring, however, such as
has so ofter disgraced the Demo
cratic party, but, centaintly, they
did constitute a political hiearchv,
of which New Orleans and the
State of Louisiana may well feel
proud.

her school.
