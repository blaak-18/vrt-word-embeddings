There was a mass meeting at
Pilette yesterday afternoon. T'he
attendance was quite large for a
ward meeting and judging from
the liberal applause of the audience t
the views expressqd by the speakers t
met with the approval of the voters
of that section of the parish. There
is no doubt that the loyal and un
terrified Democracy of old Pilette
will speak in no uncertain tones on
the z4th instant.
The entertaintient given by the t
company composed of local talent
and for the benefit of the Jewish
cemetery was a most brilliant suc
cess and reflects great credit upon
the performers as well as the mana
get. "Dollars and Cents" was the
title of the play and it was rendered
in a manner that would do honor
to professional performers. The
success achieved by the young la
dies and gentlemen who kindly vol
unteered their serv;ces for this very
laudable cause, will, we hope, serve
as an incentive so that in the future
the people of the town will be af
forded the opportunity to witness
many more such entertainments.1
To Mr. B. Falk, manager of the
Operm-bouse, is due no little credit
for the success of the afair.

A tcklooklag young .t o
If in
r d .ighbt and ' he willa
-gai his liberty it is very likely that d
be will spend- sonme time at Baton
Rouge. It appears that Hickley b
met a stranger at the depot and a
asked him for a dime to get -some
thing to eat. The stranger kindly
consented to help the boy and took n
from his purse ten cents which he
gave him to buy a lunch. Un
fortunately for Hickley he saw a
few bills in his benefactor's purse c
and he thought- he might secure a
some of them before going away.
He accordingly stayed around the
sitting room and watched for an op- 1
portunity. The man who was wait
ing for a train went to sleep on one
of the benches and while asleep his
purse was taken from him. He sus
pected that Hickley was the thief l
and took the necessary steps to
have him arrested. Thinking that $
he would in all probability beat his d
way out of town on the first train, a
the man found Hickley on what the
bum fraternity call the "blind" and it
proceeded to search him. Two ten
dollar bills were found in the leg
gings of the drawers and five dollars
in the lining of his coat. As $2S
was the sum stolen there was no F
doubt that the thief was caught.

HER 6ORARDON.
A Colored Women ravels Pros
Oklahoma to see her Grasd*
son in the Lafayette Jail.
Bertle Debaptist, the. young mu
latto who is charged with assaulting
and robbing John Rosenski, some
days ago near the railroad yards,
is not as friendless as might have
been believed from his appearance
and mode of traveling. Wednes
day evening a woman giving the
name of Mrs. S. J. Sandridge called
at the home of Mr. Billaud, the
Sjailer, and stated that she was the
grandmother of Debaptist and
wanted to see him. Mr. Billaud
complied with the woman's request
and conducted her to the jail and
brought her face to face with her
grandson who was in the cell.
There was a striking contrast be
tween the grandmother and child.
The former's complexion is white
and no trace of the negro can be
detected on her features, while the
latter is a dark mulatto and looks
more like an African than a Cauca
sian. . The womant -was.. neatly
dressed an l her general appearance
and manner of speech betokened a
marked superiority over the major
ity of females of her race. She
broke down and cried several times
while in the presence of the prisoner
and seemed to feel keenly his posi
tion. She is a resident of Little
Rock, Ark., but was in Guthrie,
O. T., when she heard of Debap- 1
tist's arrest and came from that
city to this town to do something
to assist her grandson out of his
present troubles. Debaptist seem
ed to be glad to see her, but he
I coolly remarked that tears would do
t no good and that the best thing to
r do was to get a lawyer and try to
1 get him out. Before leaving the
jail the woman gave Mr. Billaud
some fruits and cakes which she
r had brought for the prisoner.

G. Voorhies, A. L. Guilbean and I
Sheriff Broussard addressed the
meeting.
Mr. Alfred I)elbomme offered the
following resolutions, which were
adopted: I
Whereas, The Democracy of the First
ward, in mass meetinag assembled, deplores |
the recent "bolt" of the minority faction at I
the meeting of the Parish Executive Com- I
mittee in Lafayette{ for frivolous reasons, I
which served merely as a pretext to carry I
out a "cut and drled" intent to "bolt," 
thereby attempting- to- disrupt the Demo- I
cratic party, on the eve of its great struggle L
with the common enemy of Louisiana-the 1
Republican party--whosem very name is the
synonym of com ptie. venality in office, 1
and negro domination.
Resolved, That we condemn said action
by the "bolters" as a gross violation .of the
trust committed to their care, and we call 1
upon all true Democrats `tegardless of fac- a
tion and past differences, to rally to the
support of the majority of the Executive
Committee ino their effrtto secure white su= I
premacy through white prC.mariesc
Resolved, That we denounce the calling
of a primary on the s th of December by I
the minority faction as a transparent trick, I
the object of which is to mislead the people I
and confuse voters as to the date of the true I
white primary, which has been set for the
a 14th of December by the majority of the
Parish Executive Committee, the only body.
competent to do so. 1
Resolved, That we endorse the National 1
and Democratic State administrations, confi
dently believing that our party friends will
see to the payment of the already earned
bounty, and that the position of sugar as a
revenue producer will be firmly established, I
t and that our suffering rice industry will re
r ceive that protection which anti-trust legis.
lation would give it, we pledge that La
I fayette will roll up her usual Democratic
majority for the nominees of the party.
Resolved, That in Isaac Broussard, the
%"Cow-boy Sheriff" of Lafayette, we possess
one of the best executive officers in the 1
South, who, by his courage, detective abili
ty, untiring vigilance and sleepless energy,
has forged his way to the front and by the 1
faithful execution of his office duties brought
3 order out of chaos in this parish, inspired a
wholesome respect and fear of the law on
the part of evil-doers.
Be it further resolved, That we pledge
him our hearty support of his candidacy.
Resolved. That in Julian Mouton, the
brilliant orator and advocate, we recog
naze one who has, in the short time that he
has been in public life, made a commenda
ble record as president of the School Board
and member of the General Assembly, and
that we do now indorse his candidacy for
Judge of the 17th Judicial District and
pledge him our support.
Resolved, That we indorse the candidacy
of Minor T. Gordy, of Vermilion.
Resolved, That we commend the course
of the different candidates for Clerk of
Court in submitting their claims to the pri
mary of December z4th, and pledge our
r hearty support to the nominee thereof.
Resolved, That we advise all candidates
tosubmit their claims to the primary of the
r 14th of December, and that it is the duty of
all Democrats to support the nominees
thereof.
Dr. Mayer offered the following:
Resolved by the Democracy of Lafayett:e,
in mass meeting assembled, That it is with
unfeigned regret and heartfelt sorrow that
we will shortly sever our official relations
with Judge Allen, of St. Mary, owing to the
redistricting of the 17th Judicial District;
that we recognize in him a good friend
an honest citizen and an upright judge
and deservedly popular in this par
r ish, regardless of faction; that in
bidding him farewell we desire to
formally express our appreciation and thanks
for the able manner in which he has con
ducted the judicial affairs of this parish, and
our hope that every measure of success will
attend his future.
Be it further resolved, That a copy of
these resolutions be engrossed and forwarded

Carencro in Linsd.
f CARENCRO, La.,-Dec. I, I895.
An enthusiastic meeting of the Democrats
of the Sixth ward whs held this afternoon at
A. C. Guilbeaux's hall. Mr. Numa Breaux,
an esteemed citizen of our community, was
elected president and Prof. C. F. Latiolais
t secretary. The following gentlemen were
made vice-presidents of the meeting: C. C.
Brown, John Roger, Alcide Broussard and
Jean Guilbeau.
Mr. Julian Mouton being called upon, ad
dressed the meeting in his usual forcible and
eloquent style. He explained the present
political situation in our parish, referring to
the difference between the regular Demo
t cratic parish organization and the members
of the committee who wtthdrew from the
court-house aud met at M.. Cbchrane's office
to order primaries of their own. He ex
) plained how absurd it looks on the part of
- the bolting committee to ltave called for
Sprimaries in March to nonihate delegates to
a convention when the reTtilar Democratic
- Judicial Convention will meet in Lafayette
5 on the a1st of December; hedwelt at length
- on the fundamental principles of a republi
t can form of government thait the majority
must rule, and he said that. all intelligent
Speople would fail to understand how four
: could dictate to sit on a committee or ten.
Mr. Mouton was followed by Mr. Edward
G. Vorhies, who recalled tHe .ituation eight
years ago when our population was battling
Sagainst negro rule; he recalled the fact that
at that epoc he had stood elbow to elbow
with the propagators of white supremacy,
and forcibly impressed tbh audience with
Sthe idea that he "still stands strong" on that
question. He announced the fact that be
ing a Democrat his candidacy for the clerk
e ship was subject to the white primaries of
the 34th of December and that those prima
ries he considered the result of the action of
Sour regular Democratic committee. To his
k friends in Carencro he said that one of his
deputies, should he be elected, would be se
lected from among the voters of the Sixth
f ward.
Mr. J. O. Broussard, candidate for rep
resentative to the Legislature, made a forci
ble plea in defense of the regular Demo
s cratic organization, of which he is president,
and positively stated that the gentlemen who
Sbolted the committee retired from the court
a fouse only after he (Mr. Broussard) had
voted on the substitute offered by Mr. Coch
rane. He furthermore stated that Mr. W.
B. Torian had been allowed to participate in
the meeting merely for the sake of harmony,
inasmuch as Mr. Martin's proxy could have
been given to another member of the com
mittee and not to any one else. Mr. Torian,
She furthermore said, went into the rump
committee unauthorized, inasmuch as the
Sproxy of Mr. Martin was left at the court
house.
Mr. A. M. Matin, one of the candidates
for clerk of court, followed him and in a
short address said that his candidacy was
d subject to the primaries 'f December 34th,
e and that he recognized none other as the
y Parish Executive Committee but that pre
sided over by Mr. J. O. Broussard; that if
She.were nominated on the 34th of Dccu-I
ait, and it he were dfeseted before the psi.
waries that his support would go to hisplss
eat adversary, bMr. Voorhies.

Judge O. P. Guilbeau and Hon. A. C.
Gailibeu reiterated their oft-expressed alle- C
pÃ½tce to the Democratic party, and em- C
hatically stated that none but the primaries A
of the 14th'were regular.
The meeting then adjourned.

The First Natlonal Bank of J* -
fayette.
Mercantile and Financial News, N. Y. City.
No State has more splendid natural re
sources, or more encouraging prospects in
regard to their development, than Louisiana,
as we are reminded through noting the es
tablishment of various new banking institu
tions in that commonwealth. The latest ad
dition to the list of these is the First Na
tional Bank of Lafayatte, La., which re
ceived its charter under date of October 24,
ult., its number on .the "Official Roster" at
Washington being 50e3. It succeeds to the
business heretofore carried on by the Peo
ple's State Bank of the same place, which
has just closed a useful and honorable career.
The First National succeeds to all the in
terests of its predecessor, and is therefore
assured of a profitable business from the
outset. It is not necessary to explain all the
advintages gained through the change that
has been effected, ais they are well known to
all financiers and welt informed business
men. But we may remark, in passing, that
the restrictions thrown aboqt the national
banks are so numerous, and the accounts.
bility to which they are held is so strict, that
a higher degree of security than can be oth
erwise ,btained is assured.
The First National starts in with a capital
of $5o,ooo, which is deemed to be sufficient
for its present needs. It is organized on a
thoroughly substantial basis, and the fullest
confidence is felt throughout the community
in the able men who represent and control
its affairs. Mr. Crow Girard, who was
cashier of the old bank, lias been elected to
the presidency, the duties of which he is in
every respect well fitted to discharge. He
has been identified with the management of
the bank from the first, and has proved him
self a faithful, conscientious and reliable
official and a thoroughly competent finan
cier. The cashier is Mr. S. R. R. Parker
son, who was assistant cashier of the old
bank. He is poputar in both business and
social circles, and has a wide acquaintance
with leading business men .throughout that
section, and is a wan of long experience in
he banking business and is looked up to and
respected by all who know him. The board
of directors is made up as follows:
Crqw Girard, P. B. Roy, C. C. Brown, J.
G. Parkeason, N. P. Moss, J. S. Whitting- )
ton, Alcide Judice, F. Demanade and A. J.
Moss.
This is the only bank in Lafayette and it -
*is evidently a strong, well-managed and use
ful institution, and there is no doubt but
Louisiana will continue to sustain her hon
orable record as long as her business men
have such institutions to aid them in their ;
legitimate undertakings of one kind and an
other.
That the banks of Louisiana are able to
make such an excellent showing as they do
is the best indication in the world of the 1
prudence, wisdom and conservatism bfought
to bear in their management, and of the con
fidence that is placed in them by the com
munities in which they do business. High
praise is due to the officers and directors of
the institutions that have been able to make
satisfactory progress in the face of an almost
unprecedented depression in business affairs
in general.
