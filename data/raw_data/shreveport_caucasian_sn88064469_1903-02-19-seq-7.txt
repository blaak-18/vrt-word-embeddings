Washington, Feb. 13.-Tho nouse
made slow progress with the sundry
civil bill Thursday; only twenty-seven
pages, and reaving forty-eight still to
be disposed of. The delays Thursday
were occasioned by a rather protracted
discussion of the item in the bill for
the maintenance of the white house and
contiderable debate upon the item
of $3,000,000 for the relief of distress
in the Philippines. Mr. Gaines (Dem.)
of Tennessee and Mr Fitzgerald
(Dem.) of New YorK criticised the
greatly increased, cost of maintaining
the white house. An amendment to
cut in half the appropriation for the
relief of distress in the Philippines
was defeated, but the language of the
paragraph was modified to require an
nual reports of the expenditure of
money.

Like all the great country estates
near New York, the Whitney place is
Intended for more than a summer resi

tially that it is fully as comfortable in
winter as in summer. Indeed, country

RESIDENCE.
pitality being proverbial. The interior
furnishings of the place, while costly,
are sensible, and one finds furniture
that can be used as well as admired. So
even more remarkable than the manor
itself are the stables connected with it.
Mr. Whitney's great hobby is horse
racing, and at Wheatley Hills he has
built veritaible paHlaew for- his equine
pets. The stables here are contained in
what has the appearance of being a
huge Swiss structure, 800 feet in length
and 05 feet in width. with an extension
50 feet by 90 feet This structure stands
midway on a gentle slope falling
toward the lowlands of the Hempstead
plains and is so built that on fair days
In winter the sun is never off the stalls,
its rays being admitted to them by
glass half doors.
The stalls, eighty in number, are of
themselves worth attention. They are
of the species known as box and are 20
feet long, 25 feet wide and 10 feet ;h.
No stall is exposed to the weather in
any way, for back of each is a passage
twenty feet wide between the walls of
the stall and the walls of the building.
Pine and spruce are used in the wood
work, the stall flooring being of dry,
hard packed earth.
On either side, as one enters the sta
ble, are two comfortable offices, one for
the head stableman and the other for
the veterinary. In the extension is a
big harness room, and on the floor
above quarters for the hundred or more
stablemen and boys who are kept busy
until the horses are taken away for the
racing season. On this floor, too, are a
gyps luur, a library, a huge kitchen
and a big cold storage room. An at
tractive cottage for the trainer is near
the stables. In fact, nothing has been
left undone to make the employees and
their charges as comfortable as possi
ble.
As is to be expected, the estate also
boasts a private race track. This is a
mile long, the first quarter mile being
straightaway. There is also a private
steeplechase course, one of the finest in
the country. In addition to these Mr.
Whitney has had an excellent golf
course laid out, and has built "a private
gymnasium and squash courts for the
use of the family and visitors.
What may be termed the landmark
of the place is a huge windmill. As a
matter of fact. this is the only feature
of the estate.noticeable from any dis
tance, so thickly wooded is the country.
The windmill is 175 feet high and
stands on a lofty elevation, so that it is
one of the most conspicuous objects of
this section of Long Islknd.

Wonsekeeping writer offers some sug
gestions to the tasket make? who has
a mind to plan this work. beforehand:
*1 the first place, as nearly every
saffia basket is round in form, the Ta
rious patterns should ?.e planned on a
circular basis. For this purpose it is
well tp provide oneself with a little
lair of pencil *ntpass-e to mark out
such a diagram as is shown in the cut
on which to construct the design. The
*arious cir-les repr.sent the coiled reed
around which the ratlia is worked, and
by looking at the*ther tigures it will
readily be seen how simple a matter it
really is to construtg a zton working
diesign from this beginning.
The cherry pattern is an interesting
ot' to work out and not at all difficult
in spite of its intricate appearance.
The Brewster pattern is quite as sim

alternating stitches. finch a pattern
BASKET WORK.
as the balance wheel or as the wind
mill pattern is best worked out in two
colors.
Beginners should be content to ac
quire the stitch of raffia basket making
in one color before they plunge into
patterns. When one has learned to
make a respectable basket in natural
colored raffia, then something simple
in two colors can be taken up. This
mode of practice leads one tip to the
intricacies of the joyful art of raffia
basketry with few regrets and with
far more expedition than the mode of
beginning with the thing at the wrong
end and having te come all the way
back again.
But whether one is an expert or an
amateur she wil find her greatest joy
in designing her own patterns, and by
resorting to the little device here point
ed out it will be fouind that a knowl
edge of drawing is not at all necessary
in arranging a errespectable pat
Itern design.
g'% Heels an*a 'Finishef" Step.
A young lady vehemently defends
the use of high heels. She maintains
that they are mouch more in accordance
with the laws of nature than heavy,
stodgy, so called "common sense" shoe
heels. "All the 'finishing schools' which
teach young women how to attain a
graceful carriage'. she says, "have
one inexorable law that is dinned into
one's ears morning. noon and night.
'Do keep off your heels. niy dear,' or
what is the same thing, 'WValk more
lightly, Miss Blank.' And when you
step lightly you invariably rise on your
toes more. Try it yourself and see. If
you will keel) an eye on your low
heeled girl you will see that her move
ments are anything but graceful. The
reason lies in what I have told you.
She settles back on her low heels, and
the result i a logy. stodgy, stiff and
uncomfortable gait."-Exchange.
Ever keady Thickening For Sauces.
A paste for thickening sauces may be
kept at hand for constant use. Here is
the way to make one that will keep a
long time: out equal amounts of beef,
veal and poi k suet in small pieces; put
them in a kettle with very little water
and slowly render. Turn otY the first
fat and when very hot stir in flour un
til it forms a thick paste, about one
pint of flour to a pint of liquid fat. Pu-.
these into r graniteware vessel and
place in an oven and cool. three to four
hours. Keep in glass jars covered.
And Yet It Pays.
The enormous expense of xiving saatb
pies of good: may be appreciated when
it is stated chat ten large retail stores
in Chicago sand out in this way every
year 220,000 yards of woolen dress
goods, the retail price of which is 75
cents a yard, and 80.000 yards of silk,
the retail price of which is $1 a yard.
And yet the mnnagers say it pays well.
