BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.

C. S. BARRETT,
President National Union.
Editor Jeffersonian:
Thinking that the readers of your
valuable paper would like to have
a short history of the leaders of the
Farmers’ Union in Georgia I herewith
submit the following.
National President C. S. Barrett
.was born io Pike County, Georgia, on
the farm, having had an opportunity of
an education, he at an early age read
ily saw the disadvantage of the rural
people and being desirous that the
farmers’ children should be enlight
ened he began teaching school, nev
er neglecting his farming interest.
It has been my privilege to visit
the home of his birth, also to talk
with many people who were his stu
dents, the high esteem of his fellow
playmates, of those whom he has in
structed, also his entire acquaintance
places Charlie as an ideal leader.
The people of the Farmers’ Union
should ever be proud of this son who
has always been true and faithful
and who has given his life to the
betterment of the farming people.
Long live the memory and example
of the Georgia boy, who has risen to
such fame without one word spoken
against his character or his unswerv
ing fidelity to the farmer.
State President R. F. Duckworth,
like Barrett, was also born on the
farm in Texas. Having had an oppor
tunity for an education he gladly ac
cepted it. He became interested in the

education of the rural districts, never
neglecting his farming interest, this
opportunity, for serving the interest
of the farmer, brought before him the
true condition also the need of the
farmer.
When the Farmers’ Union was ex
ceedingly young he joined, after study
ing the principles advocated by our
noble order, he laid down all other
interests and threw his entire support
to furthering and defending the cause
of the farmer.
He came to Georgia and began the
work alone; not once has he faltered
or wearied in this fight. He, like C.
S. Barrett, has always been true and
faithful, not one word of discredit has
been hurled against him. He stands
today a model, a monument before all
the world advocating the cause of
reform, true to the interest of the com
mon people, teaching the world that
there still remains a fearless defend
er of the cause of right.
J. L. Barron, State Secretary and
Treasurer, was also born on the farm
in Upson county, Georgia, his father
having discovered the making of a
man in his only boy, after considera
ble sacrificij, gave him an education,
(by the way he is a living example of
C. S. Barrott’s school boys.)
Upon the advent of the Farmers’
Union in his community he became
an ardent supporter of its principles,
perhaps of the three he hated to lay
down the school room the worst of
either, he too being a rural teacher
with a bright future and promise of a
long and useful life in bettering the

condition intellectually of the farmers’
boys and girls.
I£ was a noble sacrifice that this
talented young man made in laying
down all his interest and his desires
and throwing his entire life and abili
ty into this entire reform movement,
he like Duckworth and Barrett, stands
today pre-eminent in name and act
not a word has ever been spoken
against him as a man or an official.

the space, I will close by saying that

what the union is in Georgia today
those three should have the credit
of it. All honor to the men who with
out hope of reward will sacrifice home
and ambition and future for the cause
of our oppressed people.
May the divine hand of God ever
overshadow and protect the labors
of all men who are true and faithful
to their constituents. J. L. LEE.
Barnesville, Ga., Feb. 25, 1907.
NOT POLITICAL.
(Farmers Advocate, Topeka, Kan.)
The Topeka Capital is worried lest
the Farmers’ Union goes into poltics. It
tries to make itself believe it scents
the coming of another political storm.
Every member of the union knows that
the editor of the Capital is needless
ly losing sleep. President Roosevelt
has advised farmers to organize for
business purposes and they are doing
it. Tens of thousands of union men and
women can testify as to the financial
merits of their organization and they
are not going to be scared because
the editor of the Capital fears the far
mers may ask for their rights at the
hands of the law makers. No, Mr.
Capital, don’t have any more night
mares about the real Farmers’ Union.
Not a man in it wants the order to be
come political and furthermore the
laws of the order are so framed that
it is an easy matter to keep out of pol
itics in case an effort was made to
divert the order from its objective
point.
Any organization that has to be or
ganized by the money of the specula
tors and gamblers in farm products
can never be of any benefit to the
farmers. The men who are now mak
ing the prices on farm products will
never help the farmers change condi
tions so as to benefit the farming class.
There should be but one organiza
tion of farmers and when the farmers
find out how they have been hoodooed
by the bucket shop men there*will be
but one. Oil and water will not mix,
neither will bucket shop men and
farmers mix.
A meeting of delegates from the va-
rious county farmers’ unions of Mis
souri will be held at West Plains
March 20th for the purpose of effecting
a state organization. The meeting will
continue for three days. Prominent
members of the organization are to
be present, including National Secre
tary R. H. McCulloch, of Beebe, Ar
kansas, and H. <N. Ray, Missouri state
organizer.
In this state there are 280 local un
ions, and the order is growing rapidly,
the last five months showing an es
pecially remarkable increase in its
membership.
FARMERS UNION TO HAVE A
FOURTH OF JULY ORATION.
At the session of the Gwinnett Coun
ty Farmers’ Union in the courthouse
Friday, President John M. Davis ap
pointed a committee of J. A. Smith,
W. A. Bennett, H. L. Peeples, Arthur
Brogdon and J. W. McElvaney to in
vite Hon. Thomas E. Watson to de
liver an address in this county on the
fourth day of next July.
We hope that Mr. Watson will accept
this invitation, and, if he does, it will
be a far greater gathering of farmers
than the recent Atlanta convention.

THE PROFITS ON WAREHOUSES
TO THE FARMERRS’ UNION.
W. A. Cole, the farmers’ union ware
house manager at Alma, sold another
lot of 1,000 bales of union cotton from
the Alma warehouse at 10.50, all
around. This is $5 per bale more than
the best price offered on the streets of
Little Rock. Brother Cole also assist
ed in the sale at the same time of 900
bales from the union warehouse at
Charleston, at the same price.
Thus a union sale has been effected
by these brethren in western Arkan
sas of 1,900 bales of cotton on which
w they saved, by holding in their ware
house, the suul of $5 per bale over
what the cotton would have brought
them on street sale or $9,500 saved
to the union in the holding of this
1,900 bales.
Brother Cole sold a block of 600
bales from the Alma warehouse some
ninety days ago for which he got 11c,
or an average of $7 per bale more
than could have been gotten on the
streets at that time for the same cot
ton, or a profit of $4,200 to the farm
ers on the 600 bales.
So we have this as an object lesson
for our people. This little warehouse
at Alma, we think, did not cost more
than $1,500, and then on these two
sales Brother Cole has netted for the
brethren a profit of $9,200, or enough
to pay for this little warehouse about
seven times.
Build warehouses! Yes, build ’em.
They pay. We can’t do without them.
Yet, fellows say, “I oppose the ware
house system ’cause there’s a monop
oly about it.” Givers more monopoly
if you please.—Arkansas Union.
WHO FIXES PRICE ON COTTON.
Chief among the subjects of impor
tance we present for the considera
tion of the farmer is the one pricing
his own products. Who fixes the price
on your cotton and when did the farm
er surrender the plain right to fix the
price of the products of his own labor?
No other class of people have ever
surrendered that right except the
good natured, unwary farmer, and
Good Lord, how he has been bled as a
result of this foolishness! Right here
is the root of the principal evil you
have to contend with, for this right
once surrendered is hard to recover.
It is the indisputable right of every
man to fix the price of whatever he
may have for sale and the farmer la
