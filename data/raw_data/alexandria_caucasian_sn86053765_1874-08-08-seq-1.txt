EVENTS 0? THE TUE?.
tiie great trot at saginaw—
MICII.— goldsmith maid be aïs
dexter's time-eight thou
sand spectators.
Frojn the New York Sun.
The great trot at E;;.-!. Saginaw,
Mich., on the 10th inst.. l?etwet n
Goldsmith Maid and Judge Puller
ton, was one of the greatest events
of the turf season. The ;.t■tendance
was estimated at 8000 people. The
j track was in splendid condition.—
! The race course is une mile and a
j fraction over three fee': it) length,
j In this face Goldsmith Maid trot
jted the fastest three heats ever
! made. The slowest ol" those heats
is better than the best recorded
j time over made by a trotting horse.
I The following is a detailed state
! ment of the race :
First Heat. —Judge Pullerton had
; a slight lead, which was increased
j at the first furn, the Maid going
! off her feet, and was at least four
or five lengths behind at the quar
ter: but from this time out it was
straight work. Slowly, but surely,
the gap narrowed, and at the half
î mile post the Judge was only a
length the leader, which he main
tained around tl>" (urn: but as the
j horses swung into the home stretch
j the Maid collared and passed Ful
jlerton. taking the lead and winning
the heat by a scant length. Gold
sin it Ii Maid's time 2:19f| ; Judge
j Fullertôn's 2:20£
! Second Heat. —The horses got a
? ood seU(1 wit!l hut little an
! »oynticc, the Maid taking a slight
j lead. Both horses settled down
j squerely to work from the outset:
; »iot a skip a break, but good
solid business. Tb<j quarter was
leached at 33A seconds, nearly a
j secourt better than the first heat,
and the Maid two lengths ahead.—
Gradually the space between the*
leader aiitf his fast tFotfing'compet.
itor increased, and at the half mile
post there were five or six lengths
between the horses. Handsomely
she »prang into and came down the
home-stretch, and, although the
Judge was closing up the gap, it
was only an incentive to renewed
efforts. A thousand vo ces were
hushed. Ihere was a breathless i i
lence for an instant or two, as the
two panting steeds flew down the
track toward tho stand, that was
only broken by the harsh voices of
the drivers and the crack ot the
whips. At first there was a little
shout from some of the assembled
multitude, mingled with the clap
ping of hands, as tho Maid crossed
the string the winner of the next
heat by two full lengths. Two six
teen and a halt came from a dozen
quarters; while others, more pru
dent and less excited, demanded
the official time. Not a little sur
prise was manifested as the timers
reared their board and 2:16$ was
exhibited in bold outline. Then
there was a conference of timers
and judge, at the conclusion of
which the official time was au
iiminced as2 .1(U, as the time taken
l»y no less than five watches of offi
ejal timers, and one quarte*' of a
second better than the best time on
record. FullerUm's time was 2:18.
Third lleat, —On the send off the
Maid had a full length the advant
age. The quarter was reached iu
thirty-three seconds, when it struck
the observers that she was making
faster time than ever before. The
halt mile post was reached in 1 07i
a second better than in the former
heat, and Judge Pullerton full six
lengths behind. On, but it was a
fine sight such an one as will not,
perhaps, be witnessed for years.—
Not a skip or a start, close down
to th« pole, the mare moving like
some intelligent machine, stimula
ted with an intellectual motive of
ambitious conquest, seemingly
aware that breathless thousands
awaited the result, while Judge F..
a short distance in the rear, was
doing fully as handsome trotting,
but with a little less speed, al
though overcoming in a large
measure the wide gap exposed to
view as the horses swung around
che lower turn. Once, just as the
homes swung around the lower
turn. Once, just as the Maid pass
ed the distance pole, she shook her
head, and every one thought it was
a break; but not a break or a skip ;
and she passed under the line amid
the most deafening shouts. Time,

The Boy and the Skeleton.—
A physician in New York had long
been pestered by little Arabs who
came to peddle candy. At last,
when patience had ceased to be a
virtue, he told the boy to go into
the yard, where there,was a lellow
who had a sweet tooth in his head.
The young pedpler entered, and his
eyes fell on a grinning skeleton,
swaying and nodding in the breeze.
The boy's hair stood on« end, his
tongue was palsied, and he dropped
jiis stock in trade instanter and
scampered off as fast as his legs
could carry him. The doctor, a
kind hearted man withal, and very
tall and lank, by the way, fearing
that he had carried the joke too
far, picked tip the candy and ran
out, crying, "Come back, boy;
there's nothing here to hurt you."
"Oh, no," said the boy, "ye don't
eoypj> tUat over mei I 'know ye, if
y>U huv-o got vrvrçr ' OB." •
IdP This little sketch taints of
"legal quibble" ar.d the New York
er's point is a clever though sharp
one, and one that no Horse-Court
of Appeals could conscientiously
reverse. The contributor caps bis
MSS. in these significant words—
a joke on a livery man.
In the city opposite us, there is
a livery man well known to all per
sons in this section of the country,
for the sorrowful way in which he
takes the joke on himself I am
about to relate.
One day a New Yorker stopped
at his stable to hire a horse, but
being a stranger, Smith, the livery
man, refused to hire, unless the full
value of the horse was deposited.
The New Yorker, after a great deal
of talk, made the deposit, and af
ter he rode away Smith chuckled
to himself, saying, " I had no idea
the fellow was such n fool as to
leave the full value ; but then I
thought I had better make him, he
looked kind o'green. Now I am
sure of my hire, it he never comes
back."
Towards evening the New York
er returned and surrendered the
horse to Smith, who refunded the
deposit ; placing which in his pock
et book, the New Yorker essayed
to depart, when Smith stopped iiim
and requested his hire. The New
Yorker blandly rejoined, "1 was
riding my own hors«*, sir. l)id 1
not buy him fiom you this morn
ing, and now have you not just
bought him from me ? I have the
money and you have the horse, so
what are you talking about F
Smith saw the point, and stalked
into the stable as flie New Yorker
retreated homeward.

Possum Hollow Piiilosophy.
The weather was extremely hot and

A Small Line of Samples. —A
member of the Saginaw county bat
was recently in one of our thriving
interior towns on professional bus
iness. In the office of ihe hotel he
was accosted by a very agreeable
gentleman, evidently of the genus
drummer, who wanted to know
"where lie was from." The legal
gentleman not exactly relishing the
stranger's familiarity, answered
shortly, "From Detroit." The next
question was, "For what house are
von travelling"/" "For my own."
"You are ! May 1 ask your name V
"You may." Pause—enjoyable to
the lawyer, embarrassing to the

THE GRANGERS.
A Minnesota Grauger has 3.000
acres of beans.
New Jersey has seventy eight
granges, with a membership ot
0,000.
The secretary of the Ohio State
Grange, D. M. Stewart, reports
about ninety new organizations
each mouth.
Since the organization of Waco
Grange, Kansas, the justice of the
peace and constable iu that neigh
borhood have had liothiug to do.
A county in Pennsylvania which
Jan. 1, 1874, luid but oue Grange
with less tbau 100 members, now
reports 40 Granges, with a mem
bership of 4,000.
A new game called "Granger
seven up" is announced. Three
persons play for a can of oysters.
The first man out gets the oysters,
the last the can and the "middle
man" don't get anything.
The Department of Agriculture
estimates the saying to the Patrons
in the West iu the purchase of sup
plies which has accrued from the
establishment of the grange at be
tween 80,000,000 and $8,000,000.
The National Grange has con
tributed over $3,000, to the suffer
ers by the overflow, Und the State
and subordinate Granges over $11,
000 for the same purpose. A no

zation as the Patrons of Husbandry.
In 1,818 granges in Iowa there
are no iess than 25,000 women, each
of whom is entrusted with a vote.
The women are thus being rapidly
prepared for the ballot by instruct

The Muscatine County Council,
Iowa, at a recent meeting, passed
resolutions expressing their appro
bation of the determination ot Gov.
Carpenter to enforce the railroad
law ot the State. They express a
sincere wish that no technicalities
will render the law inoperative for
another year, and allow the present
extortions to be kcj t np.
The lecturer, treasurer, and chap
lain of the Arkausas State Grauge,
oti oue or two occasions, were not
present at the meeting of the State
Grange, and .hat body declared
their places vacant, and elected
other brothers who would be at
their posts ot duty. 0 The Arkan
sas Grange is sound. If officers
will not do their duty, they should
give place to others who will.
Mr. John Duncan, iu a Fourth of
July address to the grangers ol
Boy'd's Station, Ky., said : "I have
spoken of the Grange its a seat ot
learning, and it is. And nioieover
one of the beauties of it is that it
will make any member a teacher
who will only take the trouble to
find out something worth telling—
something that will help along the
path of progress what Washington
designated the most healthful, the
most useufl and the most noble em
ployment of man."
The number of subordinate gran
ges iu the different States ot the
L'uioii on the 1st day of June, as
shown by the official records of the
National Grange, was: Alabama,
