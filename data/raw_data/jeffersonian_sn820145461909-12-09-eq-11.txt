OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
FROM A LITTLE ILLINOIS GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l will now
write you a letter. This is the first
time. I live in the country. I go
to school. I like my teacher. His
name is Mr. Ben Wham. I wish
Santa Claus would come around. I
got a doll last Christmas; I thought
it was awfully pretty. I don’t know
what I will get this Christmas.
Hoping to see this in print, I re
main—Your friend, Lottie Wilson.
luka, 111.
WELCOME! LITTLE CALI
FORNIAN.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Papa has been
reading to me the letters to you
from little folks like myself, and
papa asked me “to write to Daddy
Jim, too’’, but I said, “Couldn’t”.
Papa said he would write, if I would
tell him what to write. I was five
years old last August 12th—born
the same day as the future Czar of
Russia, but not cooped up, like he
is, for fear of bombs and guns and
things—for I can go out and play
with “Dudley” and other boys. I
have learned some verses by heart
besides the twenty-third Psalm. One
piece my papa taught me I will give
here below:
“This is the gospel of labor—
Ring it, ye bells of the kirk—
The gospel of love, come down from
above
To dwell with the men who work.”
“This is the rose he planted
In the thorn-cursed soil,
Heaven is blest with perfect rest,
But the blessing of earth is toil.”
I like to work and get in wood
for mamma every night; but I can’t
saw it yet. About holidays,—will
say, that three Christmases ago,
Santa Claus”, Mr. Watson, sent me
five dollars, and my papa says it
shows that Mr. Watson practises
what he preaches about missions
that home missions were the best to
give to, when one gives anything,
ly papa reads The Jeffersonians;
reads them out loud and likes most
all he reads; but I must stop, for
mamma says my letter is now too
long.—Delbert Coxey Brown, Cal
listoga, Calif.
WOULDN’T LIVE IN TOWN.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am coming
again and see if I can win a prize
this time, as I haven’t won one yet.
Who likes to live in the country? I
sure do. I wouldn’t live in the town
for anything. I would hate to get
up at seven o’clock and eat break
fast at eight. I believe I would per
ish before that time. Igo to school
almost every day. I will mention
my studies:—Spelling, Grammar,
Arithmetic, Reading, History, Physi
ology, and Geography. I often think
what good old Santa will bring me
this time. I will be glad when
Christmas comes, and I expect all
the little boys and girls will be glad,
too. I have one half-sister and
three half-brothers; I also have four
own sisters and three own brothers.
I live in Butts county. It is a good
farming county. I also live near
the Indian Springs. It is a fine sum
mer resort. Daddy Jim has been
very good to me; he has published
Jeffersonian
every letter I have sent to The Jef
fersonian. Papa made four hundred
and thirty-two bushels of corn, ten
bales of cotton and twenty-five bush
els of potatoes. I have seven little
nieces. I think a lot of them. Four
of them live close to me and the oth
er three live about nine or ten miles
away. Who took Thanksgiving
Day? I took only half of it; had to
go to school the other half. Well,
as my letter is getting lengthy, I will
remain—Nellie Mae Leverett, Flo
villa, Ga.
A LITTLE SOUTHERN FRIEND.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
girl eleven years old. I go to school
every day. I am in the fourth grade.
My teacher’s name is Miss Mary Nix.
Papa takes The Jeffersonian. He
likes to read it. I am as foolish
about it as he is. I have just been
reading the little freckled-faced Mis
souri girl’s letter. I live in the
South. Our flowers in the yard
haven’t been killed yet. We have
had three light frosts, and a little
ice one time. One of our nearest
neighbors came from Missouri—Mr.
and Mrs. Walter Hudson. If this
escapes the waste basket, I will
come again. Hoping to see this in
print. —-Your little Southern friend,
Clara Arnett, 161 Wilkes St., La-
Grange, Ga.
A GEORGIA COUSIN.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
girl eight years old. I go to the
public school; I am in the first grade
and I love my teacher. Her name is
Mrs. Ballard. I have one brother;
he is twelve years old, and is in the
sixth grade. I have been sick so
much that I don’t get to go to school
as much as he does. I was three
years old before I could walk. I
have no sister. My grandma lives
with us, and brother and I love her
very much. Papa takes The Jef
fersonians, and brother is agent for
them. I hope I will see my letter in
the paper and will get one of the
presents.—Annie Louise Terrell,
Tifton, Ga.
WOULD LIKE SOME CARDS.
Hello! Daddy Jim:—l am a little
Georgia girl thirteen years old, have
blue eyes, light hair and fair com
plexion, weigh eighty-five pounds. I
live with my grandfather, in the
country, six miles from the little
town of Bartow. I'like to go to
school very much, and am in the
eighth grade. I like all my studies.
I am going to be a teacher, I think.
How many of you like music? I do,
and can play a piano nicely. I have
written to The Jeffersonian once be
fore, and my letter was printed, so
I hope this will escape the waste
basket too. I would like to receive
some cards from some of the chil
dren. Hoping to see this in print,
I remain—Gladys Smith, Rt. No. 3,
Bartow, Ga.
