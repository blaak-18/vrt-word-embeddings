Defy the Proclamation Issued by
L.ord Chamberlain.
WILL FIGHT TO LAST.
Threats of Exile Has No Terror for
Boer Generals--Steyn and De.
Wet Are the One Wanted
by the British OMcials.
New York, Ag. 2. -The barometer
of South' Africa full w'heu it was knowr
that Steyn, DoWet an 1 Botha had dt,
led Mr. Chambtrlan:t and had at
nounced their determination to fight i:
he last ditch, says the London corre
pudent of The Tribune. The prools
mation of General Kitchener has no,
frightened the Boer leadors, for whot
a menace of exile has no terrors wheL
they do not believe that it can be en
forced. Military men have not swerves
from the conviction that the war wil
continue nutil Steyn and DeWet are
iapinr6d
The Transvaal leaders are bound in
honor to keep up warfare so long as
their allies south of the Vaal are un
willing to surrender. Proclamations
only involve a waste of printer's ink.
while Steyn and DeWet remain in thte
feld. This is the judgment of practical
men who understand the full force of
the point of honor among the Dutch al.
lies. Generals cannot abandon one an
other when a war has lasted nearly two,
years without a sign of treachery among
the men in the commandoes.
General Kitchener's comment on the
surrender of a British force of 60 men
after one soldier had been killed is that
he is holding an inquiry. This points
to the suspicion that the resistance of
fered by the British force was inade
quate. Military men explain the difm
salty of keeping military men up to
their work when they know that to suar
reader to a superior force is followed by
a speedy release after their deprivation
of arms, powder and shot. Heavy work
and ineamant marohing have rendered
the British army the same feeling of
weartiessns shown in Eigland, where
the yeonasry force recruited for special
service is still 11,000 below the fall
quota, notwithstanding the strenuous
exertions to strengthen it and the high
pay offered for rough riders.
