The corner table illustrated is one of

It was built by one young man and

It is especially useful as a tea table,

HOMEMADE ICE BOX.
Eut Little Skill and Still Less Expense
Needed to MIake One.
VWhen prosperity reigns over the land,
things are too cheap to warrant much
time or labor being spent upon house
heo:.l conveniences, but now, when
economy is so absolutely necessary in
so inany homes, it is well enough to
.treat upon the topic which forms the
caption of this article. If the wage
earner is out of work. part of the time
or entirely, time and labor count for
nothing in the production of house
hold articles and it is always better to
be well employed than to be idle.
Now. if not provided with a refriger
ator for the summer, and it pays as
well to buy ice for one as to buy the
food that goes into it, if you have not
a good, cool, well-ventilated cellar, let
John make you one as follows: Get or
make two boxes, one a foot smaller
than than the other, and pack the
space with sawdust. Set the thing
down on the cellar floor. Each box
must have a -hinged cover. as per dia

box is to be a slatted rack for the ice
to rest upon. The drip water can es

box arrange cleats for shelves to rest
upon. Altogether you will find this a
very satisfactory ice box. the air in it
being sweet and pure and colder than
in most refrigerators. Have two sets

in use.-Good Ilousck-eeping.
Important Invention in TVeaving.
One of those inventions which will
inevitably displace a large amnount of
labor because of its increased econonmy
has recently found its way into textile

one of the duntie: of the weaver. Now
five persons can take care of eighty of
these lo)omns, where as, at pr-sent, one
person loks after six. The new
process will ru:n for an hour or two

The greatest of dangers, I think, lies
in the belief af the possibility of a Pla
tonic frieldship with a married man,
writes a lady in Ladies' Home Journal.
A number of letters havocome to me
written by unhappy girls who, having
been thrown, either through business or
in a social way, with fascinating men,
have yielded to the attraction, believed
in the possibility of such a friendship,
only to discover that what was talked
of as friendship was in reality love.
Nothing excuses you, my dear girl, for
loving a man whose heart, mind and
body belong to another woman. It is
true that too often these undesirable
friendships begin in the most innocent
way, but the very minute that you find
that this man is becoming a necessity
to your happiness you must stop, and
at once. The old story is told by the
man, the oft-told story of an unsympa
thetic wife-a wife that is not compan
ionable, a wife given over to domestic
affairs-with, as a natural sequence,
the oft-told story that you bringa little
life into his life, that you make a little
happiness, and that you are the only
woman who ever thoroughly under
stood him. This is such an old story,
and yet it is one to which too many
women listen. Mfy dear girl, look the
matter straight in the face. No matter
how bad a man's wife may be, no mat
ter how he may long for ocmpanion
ship, you are doing an absolute wrong
by even listening to his story.
SOME DONTS' IN DRESS.
Don't neglect quality for the sake of
quantity.
Don't wear a white petticoat unless
it is white.
Don't forget that long credit cften
brings discredit.
Don't trim good material with com
mon trimmings.
Don't imagine that beauty will atone
for untidiness.
Don't look a frump because you can
not look a swell.
Don't expect great bargains to turn
out great saves.
Don't dress to startle people's eyes,
but to satisfy them.
Don't make your own dresses unless
you can do it well.
Don't jump into your clothes and ex
pect to look dressed.
Don't achieve the grotesque while at
tempting the originSl.
Don't wear a fur or a feather boa
with a cotton dress or skirt.
Don't dress your head at the a ipense
of your hands and feet.
Don't buy cheap imitations if you
can afford the genuine article,
Don't put cost before cut, torded
silk won't cover a clumsy fit.
Telling Age by the Colrw r.
The common objection among wom
ankind to letting their age be knowon
is not shared by the ladies of Japan,
who actually display their cycle of
years in the arrangement of their hair.
Girls from 9 to 15 wear their hair inter
laced with red crepe in a semi-circle
around the head, the forehead being
left free with a curl at each side. From
the age of 15 to 30 the hair is dressed
very high on the forehead and gath
ered up at the back in the shape of a
butterfly or fan, with twistings of silver
cord and perhaps a decoration of col
ored balls. Beyond the milestone of 80
a woman twists her heir around a shell
pin placed horizontally at the back of
the head. Quite. differently, again, a
widow arranges her coiffure, and the
initiated are able to tell at a glance
whether she desires to marry again or
not.
New Broad Pudding Reelpe.

Set the pudding dish in a pan of hot
water and bake one hour. Whipued
cream flavored with vanilla is very
good with this pudding. or a sauce
made from a scant cupful of sugar, a
tablespoonful of corn starch and a
cupful of water may be used. Cook the
ingredients in a double boiler ten min

liats to lBe ASade from Logs.
A Connecticut man has patented a
machine for making hats out of wood.
A log of wood. cut square. fed to the
machine,. is converted into fine strips of
wood much resembling excelsior. It is
claimed that when these are moistened
they can be woven much more readily
than straw, and make a durable hat.
The inventor says the substance i:s
lighter in weight than straw. and that
because of its easier manipulation and
lower cost it will superscde this straw
now used for headgear.

the steta's Uarien Spot.
A recent McCook (Neb.) dispatch says
On crossing the Missouri river run
ning to Lincoln, the Burlington land
agents' party found a prospect which,
from an agricultural standpoint, could
not be excelled. Corn is luxuriant and
sturdy and every stalk shows large
sized ears sticking out from it. It is so
far advanced that the uninitiated could
be made to believe very readily that it
is past all harm from any source. - Not
withstanding its fine appearance, how
ever, it is not yet out of danger of
frost, and will not be for at least tw-o
weeks.
A fine crop of oats has been reaped in
this section. Much of it is still in the
shock and a good deal of it has been
stacked. it is thrashing out from thir
ty to fifty bushels to the acre and will
average about forty. The wheat crop
has all been harvested, and farmers are
now busy plowing their land prepara
tory to putting in another crop of win
ter wheat.
Leaving Lincoln the outlook is much
less promising. Between Waverly and
Fairmont, a distance of sixty miles, is
a stretch of country which has usually
been described as the garden spot of
Nebraska. Crops have always been
abundant here, however poorly they
may have been in other parts of the
state. Last year and this year have
been the only known exceptions to this
rule. Somehow this belt has suffered
severely this year. It has rained
copiously on all sides of it and all
around it, but the clouds refused to
give it a drop of moisture until too late
to save the corn crop. For a stretch of
country sixty miles long and sixty
miles wide the corn crop is a compara
tive failure. It will only run from a
quarter to half a crop, averaging as a
wvhole about one-third an ordinary
crop.
Oats have not fared so badly. They
are thrashing out from thirty-five to
forty bushels an acre. Heavy rains fell
over this section at the end of last week.
They came too late, however; to save
the bulk of the corn. Very much of it
wilted beyond redemption and a good
deal of it has already been cut for fod
der. Wheat in this section is thrashing
out fifteen bushels to the acre.
West of Fairmont the scene again
changes and an ocean of waving corn,
strong and luxuriant, is to be seen as
far as the eye can reach in every direc
tion. The crop from Hastings to the
western boundary of the state is prac
tically made, and nothing but a killing
frost can now blight it. It will average
not less than sixty bushels to the acre,
and very many large fields will yield
fifty bushels.
Around McCook is where the disas
ters of last year were most severely
felt. The gains of this year have more
than made up for the losses then sus
tained. The whole section of country
looks like a veritable garden, and the
people feel buoyant beyond expression.
Winter wheat is thrashing out about
twenty bushels to the acre and the
best fields are yielding thirty bushels.
Spring wheat is running from twelve
to eighteen bushels to the acre. Oats
average from fifty to sixty bushels, the
best fields thrashing out one hundred
bushels.
Alfalfa is a new prop here with which
the people are delighted. All kinds of
live stock eat it with relish, and it is
proving to be fattening fodder. The
first year it yields one ton to the acre,
but after the third year it yields three
crops a year, which foot up seven and
one-half tons to the acre. It is worth in
the market five dollars per ton, but to
feed cattle the results have shown it to
be worth seventy dollars per acre. It
is the coming crop all along the fiats of
the Republican valley.
Paring a King's Doctor, 1540.
The first notice we find of royal pay
ments to a physician was when Nicho
las de Fernehan was called to the court
of Henry III. at a salary, until he be
came bishop of Durham. In the ac
counts for the royal household, which
date from the thirty-third year of
Henry VI., and continue during the
reigns of Henry VII. and Henry VIII.,
we find no regular allowance was made
to the royal physicians-they were
given a "'reward," i. e., honorarium;
the royal apothecaries, however, were
paid as in the form of a legal demand.
Among the Cottonian manuscripts in the
British museum are the accounts of
Ilenry VIII. On May 16, in the twen
