ok AMERICAN TURQUOISES.
th One Gem Which ASes Ago Was Mined
r by the Aztees.
yt Although the United States cannot'
e- claim to be considered one of the'
Y. great gem-producing countries of the
Sworld, almost every known variety of
n precious stone has been found within its
limits. Few gems, however, are com
Tmon enough to be of decided commer
cial importance and systematic mining
is rarely carried on. The only exception
to this is afforded by the turquoise. The
last edition to the "Mineral Resource
of the United States," gives the value of
the rough gems of all kinds produced
here during 1S93, as amounting to $264.
r- 1)41-of which $143,136 goes to the credit
ly of the turquoise mines.
o Almost all of the American turquoise
come from Santa Fe County, New Mex
a ico. or Mohave county, Arizona.
is
.Ã½ As in Persia, the turquoise, both in
d New Mexico and Arizona. occurs in
veins permeating volcanic rocks, a yel
lowish brown trachyte being the com
monest matrix. The Pueblo Indians
lind them an easy way of making
money, as they can be obtained with lit
tie trouble, and, after being sulhj't ted
to rough grinding, can be readily sold
to travellers. Formerly, when the In
I dian was more unsophisticated, choice
stones could be obtained from them at
,the outlay of a few cents, but of lare
years the sellers have begun to realizs
the value of their goods, and now frw
real bargains can be secured.
The ancient inhabitants of Mexico
mined the turquoise extensively, an-l
the invading Spaniards found it large
ly used to incrust human skulls. and
also to inlay mosaics and to d'ecorate
obsidian ornaments. Traces of the o!,l
mines can be found to this day. :lnd
rubbish heaps ate common in the tur
quolse district. In the Arizona mi'e,
they tell how, on a tunnel being rmi
through a turquoise deposit, the miners
came across the remains of a molre
ancient tunnel, its top and sides rest
and caved in as if by an earthquake,
while in a small space, three or four
feet each way, was the skeleton of the
unfortunate Aztec, who had been imt
'prisoned there by the falling in of the
roof. In one hand the skeleton still
iclutched the handle of his old minl
hammer, and at his side was a leath, r
ibag containing, as the dis cover. r
found, several choice stones. It out':
'shows that in the old days mn n would
take as big risks in search of trasrl' Ir
'as they will now.
Another tale of turquoise drifts up
from Yucatan. It tells of an idol in an
ancient temple around whose neck,
arms and ankles are hung strings of
4 magnificent turquoises,. while each of
its eyes is a singe large stone. The
or narrator, a Mexican minor. claimed
that these eye stones were about three
inches in their largest diameter. There
h, is something in this story irresistibli
- susgestive of Rider Haggard's idols.
rVAGARIES OF SMOKERS.
a Quoer Tastes and Fads of Men Who
Rnow What They Want.
IC "It's a queer fact," said a Broadway
cigar-dealer to a New York World re
porter, "how tastes differ in the matter
of smoking materials. I really believe
no smoker enjoys trying a new brand
of tobacco and that solid contentment'
is only secured when the smoker has
become thoroughly used to some partic
ular brand.
"One of my customers, a wealthy
man, who buys a large quantity of
high-grade cigars, always smokes sto
gies himself and carries a supply in his
pocket for emergency. I have seen him
when treated to a genuine perfecto sly
ly slip it into his pocket and light one
of his stogies. Another man, who
can only afford a small sum for his
tobacco, smokes but one cigar a day,
and that a choice one. He declares
that no other kind will satisfy him,
and that one good smoke after dinner
is worth six cheap cigars spread over
the day. "Some cigarette smok
ers, who can afford to buy
the best, always ask for a par
ticular brand of five-cent vari
ety, and will take no others. One cus- I
tomer insists tInhat I send to Texas for
a special five-cent cigar that is made
in Fort Worth. He has tried about ev
erything in my stock, but can't find
anything that pleases him. He lived
for several months in Texas' and got
so aused to the particular flavoring used
in that cigar that he is almost as bad
as a morphine fiend when the supply
has given out. Of course there is a
great variety of tobacco grown and this
gives much choice for individual tastes,
but the fact remains that a smoker will
see so great a difference between dif
> ferently shaped cigars made from the t
same leaf that one is delightful and t
the other distasteful to him. Some
man want a box of cigarettes and ten f
minutes' talk for five cents. We have f

' What Coaee Will I o.
A Nebraska woman had a case of
delirium tremens from the abuse of
coffee. For many years she has been
addicted to the use of very strong cof
t fee in excessive quantities, frequently
taking as many as a dozen cups at a
e meal Her nervous system has suf
fared seriously as a result, and on
several occassions she has attempted
n to break oft the habit. but without
n success. A few days ago she resolved
to make a last desperato effort, and
'I- for a time managed to get along with

1I complete collapse and a few hours later
I an attack of what closely resembled
- delirium tremens set in. The physi

ii the symptoms, but when the nature
p! of the case was explained to him he
, said the disease was undoubtedly
w caused by the sudden breaking off of
the habit.

The Value of Trees.
How many farmers and others, too,
whose places are destitute of fruit and
shade trees. Again, how many rented
places are devoid of trees of all kinds.
Has the land-owner ever stopped to
consider that a small orchard, a few
yard trees around every tenement
house will greatly enhance the value,
attract and hold a better class of ten
ants, make life more enjoyable and
that too at practically no cost? We tell
you there is a great dea' of selfishness
when we look abroad and see how
stingy and selfish many are with their
tenants, and oftentimes perchance some
good farmer rents his farm and moves
away and is so selfish as to reserve all,
yes, all the fruit produlced.denying even
this to his tenant. Land-owners owe
their tenants and the public general:y,a
duty by planting at least a moderate
quantity of tree3. This is a wise pub
