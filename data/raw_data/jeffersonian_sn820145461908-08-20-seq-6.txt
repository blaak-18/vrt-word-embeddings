THE DEMOCRACY’S GON?ALON
Every lady reporteress who "wrote about
John W. Kern at Denver after he had snagged
the vice presidential nominatin, said Mr. Kero
has a “whimsical smile.” Therefore it must
be so, for while one lady reporteress might be
mistaken, there is no chance the whole
bunch would go wrong on so important a de
tail.
Probably Mr. Bryan knew this when lie
picked out Mr. Kern for his running—or walk
ing—mate, as the case may be, for Mr. Bryan
is somewhat of a smiler himself, although the
whimsical kind is not in his repertoire, so far
as has been observed.
At any rate, it was certainly shrewd of Mr.
Bryan to do that, for when
vou combine a whimsical
smile wiiji a collection of
whimsical whiskers such as
Mr. Kern maintains in close
captivity on his chapletted
chin, you have a coalition that,
all things considered, is capa*»
ble of making Mr. William
Howard Taft and Mr. James
Schoolcraft Sherman sit up
and take extended notice.
That these eminent gentle
men have cognizance of the
extreme danger to their cause
is already evidenced by publi
cation in the newspapers of
the Taft arms and the Sher
man arms, thrown out by one
of our best little heraldic
sharps, wherein both republi
can candidates are shown to
have descended from persons
who had quarterings and such,
far back, and gonfalons.
Therein is where Taft and
Sherman, in their m a*d
haste to discredit John W.
Kern's smile and whiskers,
both whimsical, erred, and
erred grievously. Granting
that previous Tafts and pre-
vious Shermans had gonfalons, the fact re
mains that John W. Kern is his own and
democracy’s gonfalon.
Besides, we read in the explanation >f these
haughty republican armorial devices that ’he
name of Taft originally was Tuft. Was Tuft;
retain that in your mind. John W. K?m is
tuft. He has the finest tuft in the st re (. f
Indiana, bar none. Elmore, the peerless In
diana poet, once burst ecstatically into song
on the inspiring subject:
Indiana! Indiana! Proud empire of the free,
I can’t refrain from letting go a loud hizza
for thee.
I celebrate your hills and vales,
I sing your noble people,
I rhapsodize your bustling towns
Where rises many a steeple—
Your loving kine, your placid sheep,
Your little, lambkin friskers;
But in all the state' there’s naught so greif
As John Kern’s paint-brush whiskers.

THE “GONFALON” OF BRYANITE HERALDRY.
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
Show me any poetry ever written abour that
blond moustache of William Howard Taft’s,
or those funny little things Jim man
wears beneath his ears. No poet in all the
land would hitch his muse to such trivial apol
ogies for real hirsute adornment, and none
has.
Four years ago there was a little talk of
nominating Kern for vice president—not
much, but a little. Nothing came of it; for
the democrats, having designs on the monu
mental roll of Henry Gassaway Davis, select
ed that aged, but prudent, patriot for the
place. Henry Gassaway was tickled to get
the nomination, but he failed utterly, in the
minds of the campaign managers, when it
came to capitalizing the movement to put him
in the vice presidential chair. In fact, it may
be said, Mr. Davis developed into a tight-wad,
thinking, as he did, that he was nominated for
himself alone and not for mere monetary rea
sons. This theory of Mr. Davis’ caused a lay
er of disgust a foot thick to settle on demo
cratic headquarters, but that was no concern
of Mr. Davis. ’ He still retained his original
capital.
This year when the democrats came to Den
ver, somebody put up an ancient lithograph
of Kern in the lobby of the Brown hotel. It
showed the whiskers perfectly, and was one,
apparently, that had seen service in the 1904
campaign for governor, when Kern struggled
along in the rear of as forlorn a hope as ever
was projected on a political screen. The litli-
ograph was faded and dejected. It was the
only outward sign of the Kern boom. After
it had been up for a day or two, and various
Oklahoma and other visitors had inquired:
“Who’s the guy with the whiskers?” some
Indiana man had the presence of mind to take
a pen and write on the white edge of the pic
ture, “John W. Kern —Indiana’s Favorite
Son —Candidate for Vice President.”
Thereafter, and for days, the lithograph
stayed on the wall. Careless delegates leaned
against it, and discussed the chances of any
one or all of the one hundred and fourteen
gentlemen who aspired to go on the ticket
with Bryan, very few saying anything about
the candidate against whose
graph had effectively done its
work. —Saturday Evening Post.
Wonder if Bryan, when he announced with
a flourish of trumpets that he would not ac
cept contributions from corporations, knew
there was a law against such contributions?

Tom Watson says, in his Jeffersonian, that
‘‘most Sundays in Texas are dull.” How

sonians to read on those days?—Hondo, Texas.

picture they leaned. Mean
time, the other preliminaries
having been arranged and
the convention carried on in
accordance with orders from
Lincoln, Nebraska, the morn
ing arrived when a selection .
for vice president must be
made.
Judge Gray, of Delaware,
couldn’t be coaxed. Judge
Gaynor, of New York, was
not considered eligible. There
was a hasty canvass of other
names, and, finally, the In
diana contingent marched into
the long-distance telephone
booth with the name of John
W. Kern.
“I always did like Mr.
Kern,” said Bryan, promptly.
“Let us have him,” beg
ged the Indianians.
“All right,” Bryan replied.
“See to it that 'this free
and untrammeled convention
names him.”
That was all there was to
it. Kern went on the ticket.
