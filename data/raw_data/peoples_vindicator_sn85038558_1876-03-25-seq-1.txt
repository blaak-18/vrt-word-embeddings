some pet scheme - for:; pying the al-.

with cheap currency to be quoted at

a hundred printed pages a day. One
reformer wrote hirm the other day
that the Government ought to adopt
a.financial policy so that, a poor man
coild borrow $100 as easily as a
millionaite could borrow $1,000. lie
asked that Mr, Thurman get Cotn=

The E- pqrt of AmiericaP Cottons
The foreign export of American cot
ton fabrics, which movement has been
noted Jately,, and in which Eastern
leadirg journals has manifested cou
siderible interest, would seem to have
some elements of permanency' in it.
One objection to the. American man
nIfacttire.ham been in the circumstanee
that tite golds were narrower thaiin
the English productions, which hiad
established the prestige or standard
in other countries, and which pres
tige has tetided to militate against
American domestics in those coun
tries. Buht on thlis suibject a Fall
River letter to a Boston journal says:
"Larger orders have been received.

others, of smart old people, and, at
an example, points tIo Capt. John
Soothworth, who turned ninety-four
years on the 2d day of January last.
Among the renmrkable incidents of
his life are mentioned the facts that
lie has never needed the services of a
physician; does not know the taste
of tobacco ; has no bad habits; reads
the fittest print without glassed ; can
walk long listances without even the
aid of a cane, and is generally in ex
cellent health, taking care each sea
son of a good-sized garden. When
at-the age of ninety, lie one morning

MAInux, Texas, Feb. 14, 1876.
To the Patrons of Texasm
The low price of the great staple
product of T''exas, cotton, and the
high price of provisions, agoin argue
that I should invoke your serious
consialeration to the Ieceessitfy of
planting less cotton. An experience
of years shlows that we cannot be in
dependent farmers when we neglect
the raisiag of home supplies. I can
not too frequently nlna persistently
urge upon the farners 'of Texas that
farming coulined to one staple pro
seta-cannot,--in amy - country, be re
mmnearative, more particularly so in
cotton, a crop .which demands the
constant attention of the farmer for
so great a period of the year. If you
suceed in making a large and fi:l
crop of cotton, devoting your time
and labor to it ilolne, would the pres
ent price justify you in neglecting all
other ciopl f Or would it enable you
to buy your hogs, your horses, your
sheep, your cows, your wheat, your
cowt, your oats, from which you are
t 'raw your bacon, mutton, beef,

tion and present price till not afford

which catqlut r4'out!il tQ Lonur ownl
goad.
I therefree ei'anestl exhlrt'you at
the very beginning .of seed lime, to
deliberately apd prudently consider
the importlnce of shortening your
acreage of cotton. To decrease the
acreage will not necessarily reduce
the-pseduction. My conviction is,.
that a better and more careful culti
vation upon a much less acreage will
produce. equally as great a quantity
with mnuc, eimproved staple, yet it
is nbt this'tllht I urge you to do. It
is ';thkt 'fou' diversify your crops to
the end t'hat your farns shall bte self
suppopinug, and until you agare to do
this, there can.be no general agricul
tural' suecess. "When yo adopt a
system of farming htueh will supply
your farnnms with. suflicient teams, pro
visions,. and pgovender for your
stock, and as miich cotton as you
can neatly cultivate and harvest, you
then can begin to 'realize some re
ward for your toil-not immersed in
cottol alone ; the fencing, tie ditch
ing, and the general and full improve
hnent of your farms are- neglected.
Your famuily uu.st go. unprovided of
manyjgof tme delicaeces and:.,cnomorts
which a well and intelligently con
ducted farm is sure to afford. Then,
as it is not a source of revenue, but
an unmuistakable injury to our pron
perity, allow me to invite your calm
judgmnent to albandon a system of
agriculture which subjects you to
poverty and want, while it deprives
you of time for social and intellectu
al enjoyment. The Grange is the
proper place to consider and deter
mine such questions. Let there be
full and free discussion on this sub.
ject, and if ;ou concur in ilny views,
then it becomes important that you
oegin the reform now, and immedi
altely begin to extoend your provision
erops.
