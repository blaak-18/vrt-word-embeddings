THE CONFEDERATE.
WEDNESDAY, April 20, 1864.
There is an impression among tho poor
and ignorant, artfully ' instilled by the design
ing, that in the event of their returning with-
Kht tints oT the enemy, if they are refugees j
or Xu the event of their falling within the en-,
emy's lines, that the' easiest mode t secure
their property is to take the cath of allegi
ance to the yankee government.
This base deception is being practised
extensively upon ths people of this State ;
and along With other mischiefs, a wide-spread
doctrine has been preached t prepare the
r7r men and those vhm;iy b imposed on,
!r.,r tnki .g protection, should any reverse to
ir ar.tw put tbe enemy into the interior of
our Sate. Will the poople Inten to tne voice
.... -
t' true friendship, and heel the counsels ot I
one who has no motive to mislead them : one
who is himself a refugee, and whose desires
I', f peace, :s well as wh"St; interests, lead
him to seek peace by th nearest mute.
Wn tell the people, ami -ur statement can
not he truthfully denied, that in no instance
nve the vankees kept their fiith with those
h ive trussed them.

rs. a 1 dr.uluali y is advancing the negro
. full ej l ihty with the white soldiery in the
ranks "f hi armies! And within the past
month, Gov. Ilramktte, of Kentucky, has
been obliged to protnire fifteen thousand white
soldiers, i: orthV to prevent the enrolment
in Kentucky of the slaves of th-j State.
Wherever the Yankee army has occupied
territory, protection has been ir..mised to ihe
inhabitant. In every instance 'he invariable
practice has been to harrars individuals, to
seize .property, to appropriate it, and wholly
t disregard tho rights of the owners.
In Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Ken
tucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, Virginia, and in
Kaste-m North Ctrolina, the hard hand of op
pression has pressed upon all -those who
elaimed to be Union jnen, worse than upon
thos; who avowed themselves as secessionists ;
f.r the Yankees, even, hold in respect those
vh were true to their country, and remain
so; while ihey despise and hate those who
truckle to them and desert fhe South. It is
Ml I ecaTse ihiy love manly and honest
fid lify, that tljfy. do this ; tnit because these
rni!iits interfere witji thir obtaining their
property; and thy hate tho obstruction, and
always remove it. For testimony of this
look to the people closest to the Yankee lines,
and thoe who have been invaded by them;
and theie the loyal sentiment burns the
brightest.
The poor refuge? who seeks his own, with
in t he lines, and proposes to take the oath,
will do well to icad the annexed, which we
publish from the Newbern Times of a late
date.
It will be seen thit the " grant of pardon"
is a greater boon than getting back property:
that for ibis pardon they ought to be thank
lul, if they never get a dollar in property."
In no case can they recover their property, .
if the rights i of third partitrs have intervened
which simply means, that when any Yan
kee or negro claims their property, it is gone
forever. And if they should be allowed to
have their own, " any disloyal act or expres
sion ' would abrogate their rights. In other
words, they are to bewatched, spied on, lis
tened to, caves-dropped ; every Yankee and
negro being interested to hear something
that will make them subjects of forfeiture.
Head this article, people of North Carolina!
Ponder well, ye poor and 'ignorant soldiers
and citizens. Demagogues, and artful, insid
ious, selfish men, lay in wait to entrap you.
In the support of your Government, in the
defence of your country, in a firm reliance
upon your faithful and skillful leaders your
safety lies.
Hear the voice of This warning, people of
North Carolina. It is now addressed to 'you.
The leaders have been warned, and they heed,
not : the path of destruction opens up before
them. Unconscious, harding more 'than
they know they move on. If they can-.
not be reached by the voice of admonition, it
is no reason why you should not. It you
have taken any step from which ycu would
wish to recede.d it nt mo, boforc tbe storm
comes. '
Thete is in Noith Carolina a day ahead,
not far distant, wben extraordinary develop
ments will take place ; when no man will be
able to hide from the scorching test of patriot
ism ; when wo hope and believe the truth,
firmness, honesty and loyalty of the people
will manifest themselves before all tbe nation.
From the Newbern (Yankee) Times.
The Institution or Property and ihb Prebi-i-kxt's
Proclamation. Therefore I, Abraham
Lincoln, President'of the United States, do pro
claim, declare, and make known to ail persons
wb hare directlv or by implication participated
in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter ex
cepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to
them, and each of them, with restoration of all
rights of property, except at to tlavee and in pro-,
perty case where the right of third partiet ehall
have intervened, and upon the conditxon that every
ruch person thmlltake and eubtcribe an oath, and
theneeorward keep and maintain taid oath in
violate, and which path shall be registered for per
manent preservation, and shall be of the tenor and
effect following to wit
Just at this time when, various partiet are ex
ceedingly anxious to obtain possession of the
property that many of them so hastily ej finn
ed, it wouhl be well to look oaref ally Vhe
foregoing extract from the President's Amnesty
Proclamation.
The impression that seems to exist with some,
that this reclamation was issued for the specia
purpose of restoring property, Real and Per J
gonal, is certainly very erroneous, and had
better be exploded.
The first and most prominent object had in
view teas to nardoo. on certain well denned
conditions, rebels and insurgents who have
been acting , as enemies to the United States.
To grant pardon to those who have been guilty
of these serious political and moral offences,
ought to be considered a far greater boon by the
recipients than getting back their property.
For this paTdon, many of these political offen
ders ought to be profoundly thankful if they
uever get a dollar in property. Let some of
them ponder over this point, and perchance they
may become wiser and better men.".
Let them bear in mind that it is no particular
fvor to the long insulted Government of the
United States, for .thenwto declare tnat mey
will henceforth be loyal, but, that it is a most
gracious favor toward them to confer this re
mission of their political delinquencies.
All rights of property " are meant to be re
stored when the applicant produces the clearest
evidence, that he is sincere and honest in his
an(j in pr0perty cases where the rights of third
motives anu luicuuuus, - , . .
purlieu shall have intervened.
In every case the rights of third parties must
be kept in vpw and respected. These rights
can readily tfe ascertained in each particular
case.
ni then, it should not be forgottan, the
claimant gets'possession of his property, if a
all, upon the express understanding, according
to the Proclamation, that he not only forever
renounces Sll friendship to the bogns Southern
Confederacy, bur that he shall thenceforward
keep and'maintain" the oath he taji!; uti'tani--A.nyli5l2JJllftaWcTTourse
abrogate all
rights of the claimant. Regarding the important
order of Major General Peck, No. 9, January
20th, as in perfect accordance with the true
meaning and intent of the President's Procla
mation, we again quote the last clause for the
information of all concerned:
" Pernou8 who hare taken the oath soUJy to re
cover property, without a returning loct for the
Union, had better delay their appli'-ati on until urk
times as they can, in good faith, f uljill their obligu
tiun. Doing One's Own. Business.
The Progress of the 18tn. rays We sc
once for all, that We have no assistance from
any quarter in editing this'paper."
Now, if the editor means that he has no
assistance, because all the editing is done by
other people, why we understand it ; but if ho
mean3 to say that he writes every editorial
article, why we are taken by surprise. Wo
won't charge the contrary, for we wouldn't
be a caluvuii'itor for the world ; but we haz.
ard the assertion, that nineteen-tweritieths
of the Progress readers are a3 much sur
prised as. we are.
We had given cur huge jovial neighbor
credit for sinning only by omission, that he
did not keep such matter out of his paper.
It seems now) by his own confession,
that fie commi's the sins himsell. Hereafter
we shall hoid him politically responsible for
the editorials that "appear; and if we don't
make our readers believe that they are his,
it will not be our fault.
" John," as Joy, the yankee, a flection at el y
calls him, gives the public to uu'dei stand that
he " wears his own clothes," and doesn't
wish to be mistaken for any other man.
We shall gratify him.
" The Daily Conscrvatl Ye.""
j A new paper, with the above title, mado
! its first appearance in this city on Saturday
last. It ia neat, well-printed paper, under
the proprietorship of Messrs. Jso. D. IIyman
&.Co., and edited by Mr. Htmak.
It is evidently a parly journal, and will
probably be the organ of the party whose
name it boars ; and as such it unfurls the flag
of Gov. Vance.
There are thus two party papers in this
j town, professedly of the same politics Con
servative: This last being a' fuil-blood, and
the other a "half-aud-half."
We are in the interest of no party. Occu
pying art independent position, supporting the
cause of the Confederacy, and in this support
upholding both the Confederate and State
Administrations, we represent that large and
unselfish class of citizens, both soldiers and
civilians, who, desiring quiet among ourselves
ancl freedom from internal ngitation, are con
tent to vote for Gov. Vance, without refertcce
to bis party feelings or affiliations.
We shall continue to occupy this independ
ent, national attitude towards tho organ's of
all parties ; and we hope faithfully to reflect
the patriotic wishes of the loyal and true
throughout the State.
The Holden Track.
It is due to Mr. Holden Mr. Candidate
II olden to say, that from the Newbern Times
of a latcdate, we learn that the "Holden Truck"
was not named in honor of our Mr. Holden,
but of a Capt. Holden, A.' Q. M., U. S. A.
So Joy says, and we are inclined to. believe
bim. One could not well have supposed that
there there two Mr. Holdens : and then the
"Silver-Giay Fox," an emblem, in a political
point of view, so pecularly adapted t our
candidate, that the resemblance would have
deceived a wofld. In disavowing the appli
cation to our Mr. Holden, Joy says they
never would have named it after a "Traitor
and-renegade." This is the highest compli
ment Mr .Holden haahad for many a day :
the only drawback to it is, that in a later sheet
it speaks of him as "un independent, 'out
spoken, friend of the people, suppressed by
Jeff Davis' bayonets." The snubbing of Mr.
Holden by Joy, is dissipated by this iuvolun
tary tribute of admiration, and fixes Joy as
the organ of the "self-made candidate.''
In the City Court of Mobile, on Monday
last, Jacob Richmond was convicted of the
crime of extortion. He was fined $500, and
and sentenced to three months imprisonment
iu the county jail. .
If our City Court should have arraigt ed
before it the extortioners hereabouts, and in cte
out to'them their deserts, as in Mobile, our City
Treasury would be replenished beyond t he
necessity for taxation. Would it not be well
for tho Mayor to "try h on" some of our extortioners:
The Interrogator Questioned.
The Proor. e5 f the 13th, wishes to know why-
' certain pressx 's that it defines, do not publish
i f v;i Pro. sident Stephens' speech on the
" Georgia Platl arm." .' Although the enquiry is
directly address ed to Mr. Holden, who is 5be
last man and the ' last dollar" ana toe are oy
no means asked- -we venture -to answer the
question for ourselx es. We have not published
Mr. ''Stephens' sjeec, because w think he has
perverted his very resectable taleats to a very
absurd purpose ; and ; think more of mis
chief to the cause of t' South i's done by bis
speech, than good. v,7e. there fore iritbold it
from our columns; and, as we are aiming to
benefit theause, and ar by necessity obliged
to be the judge of what is for the best, with our
convictions we could not blish It. These con
victions are strengthened b. r the fact that the
Progress publishes and adop.ts it; and we will
soon see that the Yankee pre ss in.Newbern and
North of the Totomac will do likewise. 0
Now will the Progress ans wer one or two
questions for us ? .
Some time ago, about the 21 1. of March, it
published a statement from a Southern paper,
that " four hundred civilians in No rth Carolina,
were under arrest under the lateots, and con
fined in prison." Why did it publUl this false
hood without correcting it ? partictuU-iy as on
the 23rd ofIarch we notl tb mlsre senta-
it Tf-rirtril lit -
Did the Progress think it true ?
Again: on the 15th of March, it pub 'fcbed
what purported to be a letter from, the 48ih
Mississippi regiment, to Mr. Wright of Gt'or-
ir V., the author of the famous Georgia reso
lutions, which the Progress onco adopted. l
few days sinco, the true sentiments of th
48th Mississippi on, .Wright's resolutions'
appeared, and we copied them ; and the false
hood aud fraud of those heretofore published
by the Progress are exposed.
Why has not the Progress published this
exposure, that the people may have the truth?
We invite an answer, to these questfons.
We have put them directly, that there may
be no dubt as to whom they are addressed.
We put them respectfully, that no cause may
arise for their evasion.
And as the Progress questions othrr
presses for withholding' what they are not
obliged to publish, he will hardly consider us
meddlesome if we inquire why, in publishing,
he does not correct the false, by publishing
the truth? We hope we don't intrude.
An Important Matter.
We do not see how we can more effectively
promote the object of the following communi
cation, than by publishing the letter itself.
In view of the urgent necessity for action in
the premises, we can but believe that arrange
ments .can be made with the Railroad authori
ties, and the government, whereby corn can
be transported from the South, where it is
abundant and cheap, to this section, where it
is very scarce, and wht is to be had is held"
at most exorbitant figures. We are glad to
sec a move in this direction, and hope it will
be continued, until a plan is perfected and
set on foot for the relief of this sectidn, now.
suffering for bread :
Editors Confederate:! am carrying on a
farm, and need about 25 or 30 barrels of corn
to carry me through this season. I have
made inquiries for corn, and cannot find it
for pale. I learn there is corn in South
Carolina, if we could have it brought here by
Railroad. I suppose many persons about
llaleigh need s nnll quantities, and are not
able to pay the high prices that -corn com
mands in your market. If a list could be
mado out to justify the sending of a commis
sioner to puTGhase 500 barrels of corn in South
Carolina or Georgia, and have it brought
to Raleigh, and sold for cost and charges, it
would in a great measure relieve those per
sons who need it and cannot procure it here.
I write to ask you to propose some plan in
your valuable paper, to relieve a distressed
community. I write now. because it will
require some time to carry any plan into ef
fect. If an engine and cars could be spared
for a few days, this community would be
greatly lelieved. Without corn, wo canuot
move along with our business refugees, es
pecially, who are thrown on pxr laud for a
support. . B.
Castor Oil.
A medical friend has furnished us with the
following recipe for making Castor Oil, taken
from ihe British Cyclopaedia. . It is an article
exceedingly scarce, and in great demand. The
process of manufacture is so simple thatany
one may tuake the Oil :
Steep the seeds (Palmi Christi) fox a Bight
in cold water, then bcil for two hours, then
dry them in the sun, and afterwards pound or
bruise them. The seeds thus bruised are then
thrown into waer and boiled till'the whole oil
is extracted, when it rises to the surface and
is skimmed off.
Montgomery County. A letter from
Montgomery county says I '
"Alter the death of Hon. S. H. Christian
the Holden, party in this county was quietly
dying out until Gen. Leach made some speeches
in the county, there being no candidate op
posing him at the time. I am happy to state
that there is not now an .intelligent gentle
man in the county who endorses Holden or
who will support Leach, though Leach will
get a strong vote. We hope to beat bim in
the county, as Mr. Foster will address us in a
few days. Leach, though declining when
expressly called on to say whom he was for t or
to define his position, yet urges all the old
peace arguments. We regard him as the
most consummate demagogue we were ever
afflicted with. Gjy. Vance will certainly
sweep this county.

lengthy account of the movements ot Yankee
troops around Suffolk and irtfthe region of the ; '
Blacx water, from which we condense tbe fol-
lowing.statements, not having room to pub- ;
lish tbe-article in foil : " ' .-
On Thursday a regiment of infaYitry landed ;
at Holladay's Point about ten, miles below Suf-
. - v . . , - At i
folK f ana at the same nour anoiner regiraeui.,
with 75 cavalry, landed at Cherry Grove, on
James rier, distant from Ilolarfey's Point
about ten miles. The Holladay's Point force,
marched for Chuckatuck, with a view to cap
turing our signal corps; but the object failed
as our meu made their escape. Notwith
standing the overwhelming odd3 of the cne-
my, 18 of Gen. Pickett's Prcvost Gifard, 13
men of the 31st N. C. regimeut, 7 nf the Sig
nal corps, and 7 scouts of the 17th Vs., 47 a .
all, gave the enemy a running fight, which
lasted from 8J to 1 o'clock, resulting in the
escape of our force with the loss tf one of 31st
N. (3. wounded and captured.
jThe two forces mentioned above formed
a junction near Cherry. Grove, and committed
many depredation through the country:
Also on Thursday a regiment of 550 Yan
kees landed at Rock Landing on James river.
They were met by a squad of the Signal corps

known ; but from prisoners taken aud deser
ters who had came into ourdlnes, conflicting
accouuts'of Buruside's movements are given ;
at one time stating positively that Burnsido
was preparing to move up the Peninsula, and
again declaring that they knew nothing about
.Burnside. " These contlictir g accounts indi
cate that they are spies and have come into
our lines to deceive our officers as to the real
movement of Burnside.
Reliable information has been received at
Petersburg, that BurnsmVa forces were landing
in large numbers at Portsmouth en Wednes
day last
The y ankees hold Suffolk, and have sent out
forces in every direction. They now occupy
every road leading to that town. A force of
forae three or four thousand were quarteied
ri.:ne miles this side of Suffolk on Thursday
inht; one thousand stayed, the' same night,
out mile from Zuni on the Petersburg and
Nor folk Railroad, and a party who was at
Winc'sor, on the same road, went off Thursday
night in the neighborhood of Fraok'lin, on the
Seaboard and Weldon road, where Spear is said
to be operating.
The scattering of these forces would argue
against t.'ie theory that Burnside's plan is to
move in force against Petersburg, hut there Ta
no saying n ow what hi real intentions are. It
is not at allvimprobable, that the occupation of
all the country between the Blackwater and
Suffolk, is fdi.r the purpose cf preventing any
information o.p nie movements reaching our
military authorities.
Reported Advance oy Spear. Ascer
taiuins; that there- was no Confederate force
between Suffolk aVid theBlackwater, it is &nid
that the brutal and inhuman CoL Spear,' boldly
marched his troops.out on Wednesday night,
and yesterday halted in full view of the B!a k
water, where at a respectful distance, he
viewed the "promised land' on this side.
Whether he contemplates a further advance
in this direction is unknown, but a gentlemun
from the spot informs us, that if this be his
design, he will bo compelled to halt a brief
season wheae he is, even if ihere were not a
Confederate to oppose him on this sido. The
Blackwater, an inconsiderable stream in tin cs
of dryness aud drought, is now very much
swollen and caitri.t be bridged. It is higher,
we understand, than it has been .for thirty
years pat, and u:ililc many other streams in
Virginia, does nt fall very rapkfly. But bo
this as it m.y, high or low,) if Spear ever
gets upon its western bonk, it will prove a
trap to him, which he will wish to the latest
day of his life, should he survive the event,
that he had avoided. Our forces are fully .
prepared to extend him a warm reception, and
burning to avenge the- many cruel wrongs
which he and . his villainous followers fevve
perpetrated upon the loyal and patriotic peo
ple of Suffolk and the country surrounding.
From Charleston. Our latestdates fn-m
Charleston, by mail, include Monday last,
April 11th. The papejs say there has been
very little faring since tneir last report. A
few scattering shots hod b?eu exchanged be
tween our batteries on James Island and the
enemy's batteries at Cunimings's Point, and
the ' Swamp" Angel.' . Four shots were fired
at Fort Sumter and two at Moultrie from Bat
tery Gregg on Saturday. The enemy's
troops appeared to be unusually busy Satur
day, as if preparing for some active move
ment. Nothing lurther had. transpired, how
ever, up to Saturday evening. There wero
five monitors inside, the bar bunday night.
The rest of the lleet remaius about the same.
The Ironsides fired a few shots Saturday, be
lieved to bo practicing.
The Baton Rouge correspondent of the New
Orleans "Delta" furnishes that paper with
the following item of news, which is copied
into the Mobile "Tribune" of the 30th instant:
The Confederates, numbering some two or
three hundred cavalry, under the respective
commands of Capt. Bryan," Capt. Henry Gen
tles and Capt. Bob Pryme (all late residents
of this town), ambushed a squad of the 4th
Wisconsin cavalry, under Lieut. Williams,
whdm they killed, and wounded one or two
others. Two of Bryan's men were captured
Hughes and Hough. Hughes had his horse
killed, and therefore surrendered. The ob
ject of the raid was to pick up uen and mules
(horses would not be objected to), and we -believe
they were tolerably successful. They
even came in open daylight, under the very
nose of the. videites and took .mules and teams
from Gen. Bernard's plantation, now occupied
by Goodale & Co., situated close to the city
limits.

l.fii!n.. rlr.K nnrnrl Viw Ilia TTnnr .TrMfTA '
Manly, of the Supreme Owrt, oo ths late
Act of Congress suspending the privilege of
the wriLof habeas xorpu&? -
It accords with the lm6sf wnirersal opiu
iob of, the Judiciary, of tfaJGeofederfccy on
the constitutionality of the late set, and car
ries the weight of an "additional Judicial "au
thority for the power exercised by Congress.
And it is the emanation of a legal mind im
bued with sound principles of law. It wilt
be received by the people of North Carolina
with the more reepect, because of Judge
Manly V known character for conscientioua
integrity aud devoted patriotism.
We have now the-opinions ot the majrj,ty
of the Supreme Court, sustaining the law.
Will the agitators respect tbe sanction of tho
Judiciary ? or will they continue to agitate ?
In tbe Mntter or Patrick Rarter
The answer of the officer having custody of
the petitioner to the writ of habeas corpus,
discloses a case which cannot be prosecuted
further under the writ. The, following re
turn is made: " W. T Shipp maketh oath
that Patrick Rafter was arrested and is now
detained by him, as a person liable-to do-military
duty, and who is attempting to avoid the
same: that his arrest aud detention is .-in
pursuance of the authority of tl e Secri Wxry of
War of the Confederate States."
The act of Congress, after declaring the
writ of habeas corpus suspended in its appli
cation to arrests made by the President or Sec
retary of Var in ' certain enumerated case?,
provides lhat "during the suspension no
mititary or other officer shall be compelled,
in answer to any writ of habeas cortmsr to ap-
Lpear in person, or return the body of any prr-
son aeiaineu oy nun oy me Huuioriiy ui me
President or Secretary of War; but upon the
certificate, under oath, of tho othecr having
charge of any one so detained, that such pef
son is detained by him as a prisoner under the
authority aforesaid, furfher proceedings under
the writ of habeas corpus rhall immediately
cease, and remain suspended so long as the
act shall continue in force."
It appears to me clear, from this provision
of the law, that Congress intended to take
awav from the ordinary tribunals of the
country all enquiry by h j.beas corpus intoir-
rests mado by tho President or Secretary of
War, professedly iu any of the enumerated
cases.
Congress is so guarded upon this1 point.
lhat it prescribes the form of the return which
the officer cited by the writ is to make, and
which it declares shall bo sufficient ; and tlus
form tenders no issue, and leaves open no
opportunity tor making an issue Mpon the con
struction ot the law. 1 he omcers return in
the case before me, pursues the form pmscri
bed : and that by the terms of the act, puts an
end to all further enquiry, t results that
no question can be properly raised in the mat
ter before me, unless it be a questiou as to
the power of Congress to pass such a law.
I see no sufficient reason far holding the law
invalid for defect : of power.
The 'Con federate Constitution (Art. 1. Sec.
9, par 2,) declatffs that tho writ of habeas cor
pus shall not be suspended unless when in
cases of rebellion or invasion the public safcty
may require it. This is Anegaticc pregnant,'
which implies a power in Congress, within
the sphere of the general Government's action,
to sus-prndtho writ, as u:e rarnainnntot Eng
land was wont to do, subject to the limitation
that the power shall be exercised only in cases
of rebellion and invasion, when the public
salety may require it. Invaded from all
quarters by the public enemy, as the States
were at the late sessiou of Congress, the oc
casion had ariseu when that body might law
fully consider of the exigency for a suspen
sion of the writ. It did so consider ; decided
in favour of a suspension in the case3 enume
rated, and this decision is necessarily conclu
sive.
It is conceded as a high exercise of the leg
islative power: but it is believed not to fce
beyond its legitimate range, while the mo
mentous and profound emergencies, with
which the country is now struggling, is its
full justification.
An affidavit is found among the papers,
from which it appears that petitioner claims
now to be 47 years of age, and to be "ex
empt by reason thereof from enrollment to
do military service to the Confederate States.
According to the view taken by .me of the
law, tjie question Chus raised is excluded
from consideration. But if. it should turn
out that I.ani in error in this construction,
and the .point be made aud considered, it will
uot avail the petitioner.
The first section of the military bill pro
vides that all white men between the ags of
17 and AO shall be in the militarv service nf
! the Confederate States during tne war. .In
the fifth section, those between 17 and '18
are placed on a rferve corps, not. to serve out
of the State in which they reside. In the
eighth section, power is given to the Presi
dent to detail from the class between 45 and
50, persons for office, hospital and other sim
ilar duties. No restriction seems to be im
posed upon the employment of this latter clan
in military field' duties ; and the enrollment
and arrest for duty of petitioner, is not,
therefore, an illegal interference with his per
sonal liberty. Indeed, had Congress limited
the field of duty to tbe State, as in the case
ot persons' between 17 and 18, the mustering
him iuto service simply, and placing him in a
camp of instruction near the capital of the
Sttte, which is the alleged trespass upon his
rights, would not be illegal. The arrest and
detention would not be without warrant of
law ; and tho writ under which he is seeking
redress is confined in its office to the enlarge
ment from imprisonment or custody of persous
so arrested and detained, and none others.
Upon the questions wtich have arisen out
of the la ws of April "and September, 1862, as
well as that of January last, usually called
the Conscription Act, some future occasion
maybe afforded of giving to the public my
views. At present I abstain from any dis
cussion of them as it is. not necessary, and
they may Le the subject of future, reviews in
the Court of which I am a member.
I deem it proper to state, that the petition
in the case does not set forth the alleged
ground for the petitioner's arrest; but I con
cluded to overlook this defect and meet at
once the questions raided upon the construc
tion of the law. I mention it h"ere, that it
may iiot be regarded as a precedent against
me. In general it is believed to be more con
sistent with a just and prompt execution of
tbe laws to require petitioners to set forth the
grounds of controversy so far fls they are
known ; and if the petition tiisclose a case to
which the act of suspension clearly applies, it
seems to me it ought to be rejected.
The petitioner is rcaanded to the custody
of the officer. M. E. MANLY.
