Summary of Events as They
After signing the bill which foists
upon the country a tariff system more
odious than its predeces-
Taft “Begs sor, Mr. Taft concedes
Pardon!” that it is not even as
slight a revision down
ward as had been promised in the
latter stages, when he was trimming
the roseate campaign flummery down
to a mild “revision down, but not
down and out.” Mr. Taft’s apolo
gies, however, do not help the con
sumer, and only add to the. mild con
tempt in which the public, even of
his own party, is beginning to regard
Mr. Taft. If he accomplished any
thing toward reductions, he could
have done much more. He purposely
started too late, and his staunchest
admirers will be hard put to it to find
any further excuses for the fat gen
tleman in the White House. Some
of them, indeed, who speak of Mr.
Taft’s “honesty,” etc., remind one of
the ineffectual attempts of an ento
mologist to enthuse a plain farmer
over the structure of the caterpillar.
After a long disquisition upon that
insect’s interesting anatomy, the p.
f., still unconvinced, remarked:
“Humph, ye can’t make me b’lieve
but what it’s jest sqush!”
The soft, rotund Taft is probably
“jest sqush.” If he has a spine, it is
evidently still in a rudimentary state.

What's to be done? Nothing but
suffer the bill, so far as one can pre
dict. The national, self-constituted
bell-wethers of public opinion are
shouting themselves hoarse over
“Prosperity!” and the local dittos
spraining their lungs over “good
roads’” A crust, to the starving, is
riches, and to men who have been
out of work, partially or wholly, for
twelve months or more any old job
will be a God-send, but it is a pa
thetic paucity of resource that can
find joy in any civilization which
means no more to the masses than a
precarious, hard living, and that
spells no more to the farmer than a
public road over which he may haul
his mortgaged crop.
A telegram from Roscoe Pickett,
received by Mr. Watson Sunday
morning last, conveyed
The Death of the sad news of the
Thad Pickett, death of his father, the
Rev. Thad Pickett, at
seven o’clock that morning.
Every old Populist will be sorry to
learn that one of the most fearless
and eloquent of the Old Guard has
passed away.
He was a true man, honest and
earnest, unfaltering in his adher
ence to his principles, a born orator,
an unselfish patriot. We sincerely
mourn his loss.
About two weeks ago a private,

such thing. In Atlanta Saturday
night, another private, while trying
to evade the guard was fired upon
and instantly killed, his crime being
that he had had a few drinks of near
beer and probably wanted a few
more.
These cases are absolutely revolt
ing. That a mere picnic, such as a
summer encampment, or the ordinary
affairs of a dull barrack routine af
ford the slightest excuse for killing
men like dogs for infractions of rules,
won’t wash with people of any sense
or humanity. The brute in uniform
who conceives his rank as license to
shoot his own men, because of a
harmless “lark,” in a time of absolute
peace, is something new in American
militarism. Only a state of most
necessary and most rigid martial law
would make the public feel tolerant
of such shocking occurrences. That
the men responsible for these acci
dents probably didn’t mean to go so
far is beside the question. They had
no business, in reason and humanity,
to be firing upon men who meant not

The Naval Board now investigating
the death of Lieutenant James N.
Sutton, two years ago, has now seen
fit to exclude the public from the
hearing. In this case, the young na
val officer was supposed to have com
mitted suicide. The determination
of his mother and sister to sift the
matter further at length resulted in
another investigation. From what
has been ascertained thus far, it ap
pears that the lieutenant must have
shot himself in the back of the head,
with his left hand, while four or five
brother officers tried forcibly to dis
suade him from the act, so far as the
survivors can remember; though it
was several months ago, and such
pistol practice is so common they
hardly recall the circumstances. Be
sides, why should a couple of women
3effersoniart
stir things up, and nobody is obliged
to incriminate himself, anyhow. Al
together, the case is one for privacy
and dignified seclusion.

determined to protect
Leon Ling, the yellow beast who kill
ed Elsie Siegel. These tongs, or se
cret societies, are powerful and the
threads of their webs run everywhere
in the world. Whoever incurs the
enmity of one of these powerful asso
ciations is relentlessly hounded and
seldom escapes. Many Chinamen
belong to one or another of these
tongs, which enhances the difficulty
of dealing with the Chinese criminal,
and constitutes a further strong ar
gument against the admission of the
Mongolian breed to American society.
Several Chinamen have been myste
riously murdered since Elsie Siegel’s
death, in order to prevent their tell
ing any tales that might lead to the
capture of Leon Ling.

response, but as the lady is sixty-five
years old now, presumably she had
done so, long ere this. So the situ
ation is desperate, and wreck and

Repeated assurances come that the
revolution in Spain is over.

Situation geoned into that belief,

ever, the Moors seem to have a bit
the advantage of the situation in Mo
rocco, and the government has on
hand a large, juicy bunch of revolu
tionists who must constitute quite an
affliction. For, if they are not dealt
with with tolerable gentleness, the
revolution will proceed; and if they
are dismissed with a mild reproof—
who will have gained ground—the
ministry of Alfonso, under the leader
ship of such a bombastic and ill-ad
vised premier as Maura, or the lib
eral element of the people? In any
event, the curtain will shortly ring
down upon bigotry in Spain and the
splendid people come into their own
again. The part played by Don
Jaime, as a petty opportunist, who
hopes the revolutionists will draw
his chestnuts out of the fire, could
bring him no lasting victory, even
should the throne of Alfonso fall to
him. An era of bloody retribution
may follow the outbreak, but the
blood will not have been shed in vain,
if the shackles are broken.

prevails throughout the
land, owing to strikes and riots of
from 100,000 to 200,000 men of the
labor unions. Transportation is tied
up, food is scarce in the cities, and
even the grave-diggers have thrown
their shovels down. The military
leaders have been ordered to quell
the strikers at all hazards, but are
confronted by the unmistakable
signs that the soldiers are largely in
favor of the strikers, and the mon
archy is in a precarious state. Most
any king or potentate in Europe to
day would sell out his Divine Right
commission at a considerable dis

who being yet under the despotism

of other nations in throwing off their

after awhile, several thousand years
