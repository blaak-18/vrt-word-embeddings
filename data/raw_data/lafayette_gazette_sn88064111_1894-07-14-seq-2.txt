a perfect fizzle. The whole case
was referred to the Supreme Court.
There were 14 men at the mass
convention of Populists in Vermont,

nominated for governor. The
Populists in the Green Mountain
State seem to be fewer than the
Democrats.-Brockton Enterprise.
The Picayune says that the City
Hall politicians are trying to find
out ",where they are at." It
seems an equally hard undertaking
for some of the city folks to know
,"where the governor is at." As
far as the Old Pic, itself is con
cerned, it is a matter of utter im
possibility to properly locate it.

It was Rousseau who said that
"'to write a good love-letter we
must begin by not knowing what
we mean to say and finish without
knowing what we have said." Why
won't the Fourth of July orator
throw his roll of manuscript to the
winds and follow this capital recipe?
People, you all know when you

has entered upon its third year. The

paper is one of our most valued ex

Those representatives who got
mad a few days ago made a mistake
in attacking the States. After look

Bull, I admire your courage, but
your judgement is very, very poor."
Well, it's about the same thing with
these Legislators. When Hearsey is
quiet the best thing to do, boys,is to
let him alone. Dont't wake him up,
for you'll regret it.
Whywait ? When life is uncer

golden opportunity of preserving
the beautiful faces of dear ones.

While the Railroad Photo Co. are in
town you can get a truer likeness
and a superior photo to anything
you have ever had made in this

best. Don't fail to come and bring
all your friends, so you can ex

Th a speech in the Legislature last
Saturday Mr. Lafargue paid his
respects to the "silk stockings" of
New Orleans, who do the most kick
aing, but consider themselves too
good to go to the polls and protest
: against the reign of the ring, which,
Sitis said, dominates the Crescent
Citry. 'Mr. Lafargue is right; if
ithese gentlemen would go to the
,work more for god. govern
hietmand do less kicking after elec
Stheir city. would not be. gov
by the corrupt element. But,
t is over, these gentre
'silk-ever fail to be on hand

ygew yet their share of the
One of the " ve*Rttioutn 4ues
ti ns that con t the eople of the
United States at this particular time
and one that will, .no doubt, require
serious consideration At their hands
at an early day, to avert civil war, is
the- spasmhodic quasi-revolutions
between railroads and their em
ployes.
We do not desire to enter into a
discussion of the merits of the
present troubles, but, the condition
of affairs resulting from the present
strike of the railroad employes in
Chicago and in several Western and
Southern cities is such that all good
and true men should endeavor to
bring about a legal remedy to put an
end to this increasing evil. By these
strikes the commerce of the country
is momentarily paralized, railroad
traffic stopped, and what is even
worse, the disturbing elements of
society--nay the enemies of all
governments, arnarchists and social
ists-take advantage of these abnor
m al and exciting times and like the
burglars and thieves during panics
and conflagrations, put in their work
of destruction. To this class, gener
ally idle, such times are picnics,
to. the great injury of the
honest laborers, whom, no one ex
cept the corporation managers are
likely to charge with being always In
the wrong. All will admit that some
thing must be wrong with the cor
poration system which breeds dis
cord so abundantly.
So far the only legitimate weapon
of defense of the empldyes is the
right to strike. But experience
teaches that this method is a failure
and proves disastrous both to the
strikers and railroads. What strikes
have succeeded ? The miners' strike
in England ? Through arbitration
only. The Northwestern railroad
strike ? Practically a lockout to
raise the wages and ended by arbi
tration. We agree with Mr. Pow
derly, that the strike as a practical
weapon of aggression or defense is a
failure. It is true that some strikes
have brought about satisfactory
settlements of the grievances of the
laborers,but they are, generally, too
long-drawn-out. In the interim the
railroads, their employes, and the
whole people suffer untold vexations
and privations.
This is certainly a great question
and it is with diffidence that we
make the suggestion for a remedy.
As railroads do not stand as pieces
of property devoted solely to pri
vate business, but are a public
agency, performing duties which
the courts have defined to be a
function of government, and as
transportation is a constant and
universal necessity, the government
should enact laws defining the
duties of these public agents and
their employes to the people and
thus secure to the latter' the unin
terrupted enjoyment of the benefits
resulting from, and justifying their
creation and existence. A statutory
provision prohibiting railroads
from raising or lowering the wages
of their employes without the ap
proval of a tribunal with equity
powers, upon contradictory pro
ceedings between some designated
officers of the corporation and
labor organization, would, we be
lieve, if not actually prevent, assist
in bringing about a solution of
these "ever recurring, inevitable
conflicts."
A CHEERFUL SCIIOOLROOM.
There is a theory that the root
evil in much of the insanity is in
ability to laugh. WVe are told that
when one ceases to smile easily
and naturally, there should be im
mediate expert treatment for insan
ity; that there are indications of
insanity whenever there is a ten
dency to look on the dark side of
life. There are accounts of ion
derful cures affected by simply
creating a smile on the countenance
of an insane patient. There are
said to be specialists in the art of
producing laughter with the insane.
One uf these experts will stay for
days with the patient, studying
every conceivable condition, and
when, at length, his patience is re
warded by a rippling smile in eye
and mouth, on cheek and brow,
there is certainty of returning
mental balance.
If this be true, how Important it
is that the atmosphere in which the
mind is being trained qhould be
cheerful. No school day should
begin in other than joyous mood.
Whatever the introductory exercises,
they should be praiseful, joyous:
and the benediction of every school
day should be as radiant as the
most gorgeous sunset through which
nature says to man, "It is to be
dark for a little, for I simply carry
your glory of to-day to other climes
iwhile you sleep, and I will greet
you again before you are ready for
me."
Ch ffulneis is a duty as well as
a pRivilege, and one of the questibns
thaitshould be asked about every
applicant for a position is that which
reveals the fact that he is or is not
cheerf4u When a time comes in
the teacher's life, whatever be the
cause, in which he is not cheerful,
he should be given a vacation,
and the test of his returntng should
be the return of the cheerful spirit.
Every vacation should be a time of
restoration of the spirit of cheer
fulness.

TlE CENTRAL PACIFIC.
Boston Traveller.
The Central Pacific Railroad ap
pears to have been built by money
of the Uuited States goverement
for the purpose of debauching
California politics, oppressing
Western commerce and enriching
four men. Such, at least, is the
burden of a memorial which has
been presented to Congress by a
representative committee of San
Francisco citizens.
The sole securities which the
government holds for its loans to
this company are mortgages amount
ing to $77,000,000, the last of
which will fall due in 1898. But
the corporation is bankrupt. There
is no hope that its assets will equal
its liabilities when the time comes
to pay them, On this plea, Con
gress is asked to grant an extension
of one hundred years on these
mortgages. This is called funding
the debt.
The prime mover in this petition
is President Collis P. Huntington.
Thirty years ago Mr. Huntington
was a man of moderate means.
He became associated in Western
railway schemes with Leland Stan
ford, Mark Hokpins and Charles
Crocker. All four prospered ex
ceedingly. Their methods were
bold and singular. They first ob
tained control of the Central Pacific.
By nominal transactions with cer
tain adjunct corporations, notably
the Contract and Finance Com
pany and the Southern Pacific Com
pany of Kentucky, they were en
abled to transfer over Sx42,ooo,ooo,
of the earnings of the Central
Pacific railroad to . their private
pockets. If tracks were to be laid
for the Central Pacific, they were
laid by the Contract and Finance
Company, alias Huntington et al;
and Huntington et al. named the
price. If purchases were to be
made, they were made of the South
ern Pacific Company of Kentucky,
another alias of the same combina
tion; and the combination named
its price.
Stanford, Hopkins and Crocker
are dead. But their heirs, with
Huntington, still control California
politics. Legislatures remit taxes
for their railroads and Railway
Commissioners uphold them in ex
cessive freight charges. They own
hotels, bridges, steamers, business
buildings, street railroads in San
Francisco and Oakland and large
tracts of timber land, seized, held
and sold without valid title. These
and other visible evidences of their
stolen wealth are the real assets of
the nominally bankrupt Central
Pacific railroad.
It remains to be seen whether
Congress will consent to such
gigantic perversion of government
money, by funding, which is the
same in this case as cancelling its
claim; or whether it will proceed
against the four directors individ
ually, as it legally can and justly
ought.
