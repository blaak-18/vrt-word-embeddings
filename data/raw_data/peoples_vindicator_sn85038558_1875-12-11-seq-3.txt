A Reprcaoutative and Champlion of American
Art Tast I
rospeetus for 1871-Eighth Tear.
e THE DICtNE :
THlE ART JOURNAL OP AMERICA,
ISSUEPD AONTHLY.
"A Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
carried out."
The necessit if a popular medimi for
the representation of the productions of
ouiLgreat artists, has always been reco
,lized, alnt many attempts );have bIeen
1omade to meet the want. The succle+ive
failures which so invaribly tollowed e:c"h
attemlpt in this country to establishL an
art journal, did not prove the inditfier
enee of the people of America to the
claims of high art. So soon :s a proper
aI preciation of the want and an ability
to meiet it were shown, the puhlic at
enee rallied with enthnsiasin to its sup
part. and the result wasl a great artistic
andl ceonmreial triumnph--'IlE AL)INE.
TIlE ALPDINE, while issued with all the
regularity. lhas none of the temporary or
timely interest characteristie of ordinary 4
pe'ri dica.ls. It is an elagle t iliscellatisy
of pure, light and gracieful literatulre; anl
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci
llens of artistic skill, in black lind white.
Although each succeeding number affiordsl
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
valihe and beauty of the ALDINE will be
most appreciated after it bheen lilound
iup at the close of the year. While other
journals may claim superior cheapness, as
compared with rv:als of a similar class,
the ALDINE is a unique and original con
ception-alone and nnapproached-alhs,
Intely without comnpetition in price or
character. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplieate the quantity of
fine paper and engravings in any otlier
Sshape or number of volumes for ten times
its cost; and then, there is the Chrome
besides!
National "feature' of THE ALDINE
SImust he taken in no narrow sense. True
art Is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
DINE in a strictly American institution,
it does not confine itself elntirely to the
reprodluction of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate a broad anad appreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate only
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thlus.
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDINE. as I leading characteritic, the
productiOlls of the most noted American
artists, attention will alwiays be given to
specimens from fohgrin unasti s, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and instrnc
tini obtainable front home or foreign
sonrces.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magnificent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can be affolrded by any inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, siustain an unabated interest,
inmpossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALPINE is a light ;,nd graceful accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea ii
tures, with only such technical disqnrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Premiua m or 1875.
Every subscriber for 1875 will receive a
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
samne noble dog whose picture its a for
mer issue attracted so much attention, .
"MJAN'S UNSELFISH FRIEND" a
will be a welcome in every home. Eve
ryvaldy loves snuch a dog, and the lortrait
is executed so true to the life, that it
seems the veritable presence of the ani
mal itself. The Rev. T. De Witt Tal
luage tells that his own Newfounidlahd i
dog (the finest in Brooklyn. harks at it! r
,ltihough no natural, no olie who sees
this lprelmium chirouo will have tihe
slightest fear of ieing bitten.

The Saturday Evening Post. F
'Thea Oldest and Beast Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a j
widespread ai d tublentishel d replutation u
f-r thie unsurpassed purity, refinemnlent
anud excellence of the Serials, 8ketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is Lpre-~minetly [
The Best Family Paper
that is ipublished in this country, from ite
never contailing anytlhing that wuld
offlend the feeliungs of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any lWieide without a
objection from the mnost fastidiouna.
The circulation of the &aturday Even- II
ing Post, through not quite so large s
perhaps, as its younger contemporarie,
ia not, like that of some of themn, Ouctu- r
sting, and too often short-lived, but t
SURB, IOLID AND SUtBSTA'TIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa.
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneous intlnences, such as the populari
ty of iudividual writers, &c.
Osd,. however, as tire tMaturlay Even
ing Post has been in theim past, it is our
iutention to make ir still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve- I
ry department of the paper, and will i
lall to oar assistance writers ofadmitted I
ability and known reputation.
By itcreasing its firamer attractions.
and adding many jndicious and pleas
ing noveltiea,, by studying how to please
and eultivate the popular taste, by in- I
creausing Industry and enllterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new"
frietds with each and every issue, and I
continue to maintain the claim of the I
Saturday Evening Post to its title of Tai
OtS~DeT AND TUi Bt.aT of Family Story
Papers.
