My treatment is prepared scientific
ally. It does not stop or hinder diges

er digestion and assimilation of food,
which 99 fat people in a hundred
haven’t got, and that’s why they are
fat.
I will tell you why you are fat if you

things about your fat which you prob
ably never knew about and ought to

The State-Builder of Oklahoma Writes
My Dear Mr. Watson: —I have
upon my own responsibility taken a
few subscriptions to your journal,
the monthly Magazine, among some
friends whom I approached, know
ing they would desire your argument
on Socialism, since this section of
our State is more threatened than
any other.
Herewith check for $14.00 to
cover the amount of the subscrip
tions. I decided I would raise you
a few subscriptions and got these
up so quickly, observing your ad
vertisement in this number of your
Magazine of certain erf your books
which you give with subscriptions,
and as I have all of your books ex
cept your “France”, your “Napo
leon”, and “Foreign Missions”, I de
cided I would fudge on you enough
to ask for your “Napoleon”, “Beth
any”, and “Foreign Missions”, in
view of the subscriptions I herewith
send you. Shall try to get you some
more in this county, because this is
one of the strongest counties for the
growth of Socialism in the State.
Think your articles will check it.
I read with a deal of pleasure
your article on the “American Ju
dicial Oligarchy”. For years I have
observed the evils of which you
speak in this article. Certainly life
tenure of public office is born of
despotic and irresponsible power. I
myself, as will be disclosed by the
addresses to the people in the ap
pendix to the journal of the Consti
tutional Convention sent you, had to
assail the Federal Courts in the ter
ritory of Oklahoma in 1907, when
they issued an injunction against the
Constitutional Convention and en
joined me from calling an election.
By doing so, for a moment nearly all
the lawyers of the State, including
those in the Convention, and two
thirds of the people, believed I had
lost my head, but in sixty days I
forced the decision on the power of
a Constitutional Convention found
in the appendix of the journal, which
was a complete reversal of a former
decision wherein, sixty days before
this one, they held that a Constitu
tional Convention had no legislative
power. They completely reversed
themselves, as shown in this opin
on, by following the language of my
proclamation, found on page 398,
where I state that “Whereas a Con
stitutional Convention is a body
with highest legislative functions,
together with modified powers of the
executive and judiciary, and that
such convention under the American
experience, not from my own, but
from the experience of others who
have tried almost everything from
starvation to violent exercise and
drugs and have failed until they tried
and used my treatment.
1011-2 Pounds Cone !
The remarkable case of Miss Artie
Adams, of Shelby, Ohio, is illustrated
in her own words:
“When I look back to the time be
fore I took your wonderful obesity
cure I do not see how I stood it. My
weight is now 163% pounds, and I have
lost just 101% pounds. I can hardly
believe that there has been such a dif
ference in my feelings and appearance.
But oh! how thankful I am that I
found a cure for my awful burden of
fat, in Kellogg’s Safe Fat Reducer. I
can hardly realize that I weigh now
only 163% pounds. You can use my
letter as a testimonial if you wish.”
Leaves No Wrinkles.
You should have no fear, after being
reduced by Kellogg’s Safe Fat Re-
law possesses all legislative func
tions which are not denied by ex
press terms or by necessary impli
cation by the act creating said con
tention and by the Constitution of
the United States.”
You will observe this decision up
-1 olds this language and almost uses
the same language in the opinion,
of which sixty days before the opin
ion was the reverse, Imt one judge
dissenting, and this reversal cam*
about by my going on the stump and
denouncing the court before the peo
ple, and promising them that at th*
time designated by the election or
dinance I would call the election if
I had to go to jail the next moment.
This vigorous and bold policy put
the people in such a temper that th*
court was obliged to relent. I never
suffered any contempt or never apol
ogized to the court, but stood upo*
the law of the land; and you are
right in saying that this is the neces
sary procedure to hold such usurpa
tion in check. Certainly, however,
any attempt upon the part of the
State courts or State officials to re
sist proper authority of the Federal
courts or the Federal administrate©*
would be treason or rebellion. At
the same time a refusal to resist
usurpation upon the part of such
Federal courts and officials would b«
positive acquiescence in usurpation,
and it is as much the duty of the
State courts and State officials, as I
conceive it and as expressed in your
journal, to hold up the rightful au
thority of the Federal Government,
but to resist usurpation by them
upon the rights of the State.
I have August Bebel’s book re
ferred to in your article on Women
under Socialism, and all the others
referred to except the book entitled,
“Socialist Marriages,” reciting the
transactions of Warren of Italy, re
ferred to in your November num
ber. I should be glad if you would
give me the name of the publishers
of this booklet. Yours sincerely,
WM. H. MURRAY.
