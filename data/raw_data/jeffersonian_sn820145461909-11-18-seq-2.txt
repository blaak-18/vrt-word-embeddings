SOLVING THE NEGRO QUESTION.
By Mrs. Beulah Johnston.
solving the negro question
that it would seem that the
i theme had been exhausted erq
this. A great many have solved it
by suggesting to the ladles to do
their own work. This is a good idea,
but there are drawbacks to some of
this. Some of the ladies in the
country are much pleased to do their
own work if they did not have, also,
to take the place of the cook for ne
gro wage hands. Not long ago I
heard two negroes talking. One said
to the other: “Where are you work
ing now?” The other replied that
he was working for Mr. Walker and
he was eatin# the white women’s
cooking. The first negro asked the
second where his wife was, to which
he replied: “I don’t know. I quit
that lazy thing, dat ’oman wouldn’t
cook nor wash for me, so I dooses
my own washing and the white wom
ens cooks for me.” Now I don’t
know how the other ladies feel about
this matter, but I for one had rather
do all my own work and take in
work than have to cook a meal for a
negro. I would gladly help to box
the last one up in a boxcar and ship
them back to Africa, for most of
them will take anything that is not
nailed down.
There are other disadvantages
when we undertake to do our own
work. For instance, the Southern
homes are not built with all the con
veniences that Northern homes are
nit with, and a Southern woman
does twice the work a Northern one
does. Take the laundry work:
when a Northern woman washes the
clothes she stands in a warm bath
room and has a washing machine,
wringer and washing powders to
lighten her labor; even her clothes
line is stretched along a back porch.
The Southern woman goes to a well
with a bundle of clothes. She draws
water from a sixty-foot well, then
she bends over the rub-board for half
a day to wash and wring these clothes
and maybe the well is two hundred
yards from the house. When she
gets through with her wash she is
more dead than alive. Then we
don’t wonder that she prefers to
have a strong, buxom negro woman
to do her work for her. When the
white woman does her work it is
first-class and she still has her mon
ey in her pocket, but when the ne
gro does it the money is gone and
the work half done. The white men
of this country have it in their pow
er to solve the negro question. Let
them build convenient houses, with
laundry rooms attached to the house
with laundry stoves and have the
water in reach of the women and the
work will be done in less time with
less labor and their wives will not
get old and ugly while the men are
picking out their second wives. Let
the men discard their colored board
ers, equip their farms and barns
with labor-saving machinery and his
poor little tired wife will look young
again and her children will be
stronger and come to this world

without the “lazy worm” to retard
their growth and intellect.
The white men can use their pow
er to keep negroes from hunting on
their premises with a pack of old
hungry dogs three hundred and thir
teen days in the year by enforcing
the law. Then when you ask a big
burly son of Africa to do a day’s
work he won’t laugh in your face
and say he does not have to work,
that he hunts for his living. How
many negroes in Georgia own land to
hunt on? Very few, but every ne
gro has a single-barreled shotgun,
and if a woman in the country pays
a visit to her neighbor a half mile
off she is much in her own light if
she does not arm herself before she
The Ashes of Love
Jake H. Harrison
And these are the ashes of love,
So light, and so easy to blow,
The remnant of kisses and vows,
The waste of the sweet long ago!
The dust of the hopes which are dead,
The shadow of days which are past,
The seal and the signet of Fate,
Yet love never dies. No, alas!
Then scatter the ashes, O winds,
Till not one white ash shall remain,
And oh I could you scatter as wide,
This heartache, this unceasing pain!
And leave, as these ashes, as dry,
The eyelids now flooded in tears,
And scatter, as ashes and dust,
The sorrow of long-reaching years’
These ashes were letters—so dear!
The treasures of day which are gone,
And burning them, as I have now,
Brings memories sweet rushing on;
The love scenes, the kisses and smiles,
With moonlight and sea in the train,
And waltzing, and clays in the hills,
And ah ! —then the parting and pain I
Then silence, and waiting, and fear,
And hoping, and praying, and tears,
And loving the shadows and past,
For years —oh, such long weary years!
‘ To find in the end he was false,
And then as a poor wounded clove,
With close folded wings, hide the dart,
That preys on the vitals of love!
starts, or look to have her head shot
off on her own land.
The women know that it is lawful
for them to vote, but they don’t
want to do so if the heads of the
families would do their duty in en
forcing the trespass law. When the
time has arrived that people are not
safe from such culprits it is time for
the men to do something.
A short time ago a negro boy was
waiting to get his dinner from my
kitchen, and while waiting he began
to talk about people in South Caro
lina. His conversation consisted of
a detailed account of what he had
seen in his travels in that State,
where he said he had seen white men
and women eating at the same table,
using the same towel and dipper and
bucket with the negroes. He seemed
Jeffersonian
so positive in his accounts I asked
him if he told that for the truth,
when he insisted that it was true. I
told him to leave my premises at
once and not let me see him there
again. I would not hire a negro
who had seen so much which I knew
"was such an abominable' falsehood.
When a negro displeases me I do not
wait for my husband to tell him to
leave, I pay him up and send him
away. One of the hardest things I
have ever had to do in my life is to
get a full day’s work out of a negro.
They will kill time, and I do enjoy
seeing them work on the chaingang,
for there they are made to do what
they failed to do in years past.
I like to work, and no idle man
or woman stays where I do; if they
don’t get away I do, for I can’t beai’
to look at them long at a time.
Let the farmhouses be better built
and with more conveniences and
then we Southern women will drive
the negroes back to their former
haunts, and we will be able to lower
the roosts in our fowl-houses and
maybe we can get a rabbit to eat
now and then from our game re
serves.
A good remedy for a hide.bound
horse is saltpetre four ounces, crude
antimony one ounce, sulphur three
ounces. Mix all together. Give a tea
spoonful a day in a bran mash.

THE HALF-CROPPER.
By Mrs. C. B. Gentry.
E
YING before me is a copy of
The Jeffersonian in which
Mrs. B. F. Kennedy replies to
Sallie T. Parrish. I am just
writing this because I want to say a
loud amen to the letter of Mrs. Ken
nedy, and I do thank God that we
yet have such mothers as Mrs. Ken
nedy to teach our children, and may
she live long on the earth to train
our children and resent such gross
insults. We all know the half-crop
per. We have them down here in
Arkansas by the thousands and they
are growing more numerous every
year. Will Miss Parrish just be kind
enough to tell us what it is that pro
duces the half-cropper? Would it
not be more charitable to find and
remove the cause than to class them
with negroes? Miss Parrish should
remember that the same blood flows
in the veins of the half-cropper that
flowed in the veins of our forefath
ers who left their bloody footprints
on the frozen ground at Valley
Forge. I would just like to tell Miss
Parrish the doom of a gentleman
who came down in Arkansas from
the North to make a few more thou
sands. He bought a lot of timber
and hired a lot of those half-crop
pers to cut his timber and work at
his mill. Os course he classed them
with negroes and walked down in
the woods one day to curse them all
