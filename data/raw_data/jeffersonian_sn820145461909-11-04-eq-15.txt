say they will help clear out the tene
ment districts of the cities and move
them to rural homes where they can
develop in mind and body? Slum
life in the cities begets criminals be
cause of the environment. In the
country the children of the slums
can be developed into strong physical
and mental manhood and woman
hood with no greater percentage of
criminals than are usually found in
the rural regions, because of the lack
of criminal environment.
Mr. Brisbane refers to Lincoln who
was raised in a cabin, but Lincoln is
only one of thousands of ~ great
Americans who lived in poverty on
the farm in early life. That is, they
thought it poverty, but few of them
ever went hungry. People in the
rural regions do not go hun
gry. They are too close to
nature’s supply to go hungry.
But suppose that Lincoln and other
great Americans who lived in coun
try log cabins, wore coonskin caps,
and filled their stomachs with Johnny
cake had lived in the slums of the
cities, such as you describe in New
York, Mr. Brisbane, how many of
them do you suppose the country
would ever have heard of? How
many statesmen, scholars, poets, law
yers, historians and men of great dis
tinction in any line of human en
deavor came up from the slums of
the cities as compared with those
who have come up from the obscurity
and poverty of rural life?—The Daily

WHY MR. WATSON DID NOT GIVE.
(Concluded from Page 7)
answer the “Board” that I was una
ble to make any contribution, the
Board, it would seem, gave out the
facts at once.
My losses, this year and last, have
been heavy. For the first time in
many years, it has been necessary
for me to borrow large sums. Fas
tened to my literary and editorial
work, it has been impossible for me
to get out and earn money, lecturing
or practising law. Consequently, at
the time the Atlanta “Board” made
its application to me, I had no funds
at all. But during this year I have
given away more than SSOO, every
cent of which was borrowed money.
It seems to me that each of us has
the right to decide how much he
can afford to give. We should also
be permitted to select those objects
of charity which appeal most power
fully to us. No one can know our
circumstances and our expenses, as '
we ourselves know them; and no one
can so well select the objects of be
nevolence as we ourselves can do it.
In addition to the money that I am
constantly giving, I GIVE MYSELF.
This reform work done by the two
Jeffersonians, is Home Mission work.
In a high, noble and literal sense, I
have devoted my whole time, for five
years, to Home Missions.
A friend remarked to me, the oth
er day, “Some people believe that you
will go to preaching.”
“What else have I been doing, but
preaching?” I asked.
That’s just it. There are various
ways of preaching, and one of them
is my way. It is on that account that
such clergymen as E. J. Forrester, A.
J. Lazenby, J. A. Scarboro, and many
others, realize that my consecration
to my work is akin to their conse
cration to theirs.
During the five years which have
been devoted by me .to this kind of
labor, I could easily have made from
$50,000 to SIOO,OOO, at lecturing and
at law. Every one who knows a
thing about it, knows that.
Therefore, you might say that, in
labor, I have given to Home Missions
at least $50,000 during the last five
years.
There is no money in such periodi
cals as mine. They expose and com
bat too many persons and things.
They will never make me any money,
for as fast as they earn clear profits,
these shall be used in widening the
field in which The Jeffersonians work.
So you see, I not only give freely of
cash to Home Missions, but I give
myself.
What more could any man do?
Calmly and kindly consider all
these facts, and then tell me what
you think of that Atlanta “Board”,
which classed me as a hypocrite, be
cause I would not send them money.
At that very time, my bank ac
count had been so heavily overdrawn, •
several times, that the cashier wrote
me about it, and I had to borrow
from my cotton factors, at differ
ent times, about $2,000 to straighten
things out.

the Board that I was unable to re-

spond, don’t you think that those
gentlemen ought to have investigat
ed, and ascertained that I was telling
a falsehood, before virtually declar
ing me to be both a liar and a hypo
crite?
Their cruel, uncharitable conduct
is a fine illustration of the worldly
spirit which the unscriptural Board
system generates and fosters.

pie pretend to be Christians, and
that perhaps two-thirds of those who
do pretend to be, are hypocrites, who
never put any Christianity in their
lives further than parading them
selves once a week in the church con
gregation. My point is that we ought
not to carry to foreign people what
our own people so distressingly need.
Did you know that one of the for
eign boards has recently published a
report in which they boast of the fact,
that they gave free medicine and
free medical and free surgical at
tention to one hundred and tw ren
ty-seven thousand heathen last
year? Did you know that they are
furnishing free medicine, and free
medical attention of the very best sort
to the sick people throughout the
Orient, and throughout Central and
South America, and throughout Mex
ico and Cuba? Did you know that
they are giving free secular educa
tion to heathen children, in mission
schools and colleges, when the gov
ernments of heathen countries are
extending to their children splendid
facilities for education, and that,
therefore, the mission schools take
away from the governments of Japan,
of China and of India the privilege
of educating their own children?
Did you know that they take these lit
tle heathen children away from their
destitute parents—just as early as
parental care is no longer a physical
necessity—and that they support
these little heathen children in all
of the comforts of the best of cloth
ing and food? They train the minds
and bodies of these little heathen
children until the girls are married
off, and until the boys are given good
jobs. Don’t you think that it is a
shame that we have no such establish,
ment in our own land, or, at least,
that we need ten thousand of such
