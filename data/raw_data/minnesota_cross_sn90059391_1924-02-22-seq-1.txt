-DOUGH”
It was the “dough” in Doheny that
brought trouble to many politicians.

If you are in politics, look not at
the “dough” other man’s pan.
“Dough” and politics evidently
mix no better than oil and water.

“Dough” is all right in the bakery,
but raises an investigation when
splattered in the vicinity of govern
mental officials.

“Dough” and a hole make a fry
cake; “dough” and a politician make

The investigated cry in anguish.
“Oh, that I had not seen the “dough
in Doheny; Oh, that I had not yield
ed to the sin in Sinclair.

Sin for Sinclair and Do for Do

The reward of committing the
greatest national sin—the pr<»itu

THE LITTLE SCHOOL HOUSE
The lecturer on “better rural
schools” had spent nearly two hours
in pointing out the advantages of
the consolidated school over the ru
ral one-teacher schools. When ne
concluded, a man arose from his
chair at the head of the hall and ad
dressed his friends and neighbors who
were all around him.
“Dear friends it pains me when I
think that my good friends and
neighbor? want to take away our lit
tle school house and build in its
place a fancy and expensive school.
Even now, I can look back when my
children were young. I see them
with happy smiles on their faces
start with the morning for the lit
tle school house two miles away. No,
friends, I can’t let you take that
school house away, for it is filled
with pleasant memories. Tears come
to my eyes as I image my neighbors
and friends tearing down the school
house. The wooduhopper said, -DO*t,
chop that tree,' and I say Dont
consolidate our little schoolhouse.
The man had no more that seated
himself when one of his neighbors
jumped to his feet and spoke, “I can
understand the sentiment that my
friends has injected into th« nDposi
tion to consolidation. I knu«v r,ny
tears come to your eyes, neighbor, as
you think of the passing of your lit
tle school house. You are thinking
of bygone days; you are looking into
the past when the saloons were com
mon over the entire nation. You per
haps even now see yourself standing
before a bar with your right foot on
the brass rail and a mug of beer at
your lips. You are associating the
so-called good old days with your
schoolhouse. As it happens, the par
ticular schoolhouse that you have
presented this evening with sobs and
sentiment was at one time a saloon
that you patronized too frequently
for your own good.”
THE AMERICAN MOVIE
It’s the “screen-style” to present a
Protestant minister in the a
sanctimonious “simp.”
When the movie producers run
short of Ideas for their film stories.
It seems that they send representa
tives Into the underworld and take
vicious life there as the basis for un
usually salacious photoplays which
they feature by means of titles which
reek with suggestiveness.
If you want your children to get
a “colored. Idea” of life, and a dis
torted conception of sex matters,
permit them to frequently attend
the average motion picture show.
We hear a great deal these days
about “cleaning the movies,” hut In
spite of all agitation for better
.screen pictures, one mess after the
other comes from studios, revealing
that Instead of “cleaning the. mov
ies” somebody Is smearing them
with “sin-slop.”
If you really want better motion
pictures concentrate on the ticket
office. When you hit the theater
owners on the money-bag:, th*y
sprawl and whimper “business no
good.”
Talking about censor boards, a
friend suggested that the only way
to censor pictures Is to censor them.
That was a remarkable contention.
The trouble with the average censor
board Is that It exists In name only.
We siurgest photoplay censorship
laws full of fangs and the establish
ment of censor boards with a real au
thority. Wouldn’t It he a good Idea
to put Klansmcn and Klanswomen on
these boards!

What’s the matter with the Klans
man who is “suffering” as described
below?
1. He knows how to “run” the or
ganization better than the officers
now serving. ,
2. He is “sour” because he cant
use the Klan for personal gain.
3. He insists on re-writing the ri

Almost simultaneously with
the dawning of a new day for
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
in Minnesota, comes the first is
sue of the Minnesota Fiery Cross,
the organ of the order.
It is well at the outset to out
line the policy by which this pub
lication will be guided from this
time on.
News pertaining to the activities
of the Klan throughout the United
States will be recorded systematical
ly each week. In particular, howev
er, will attention be paid to news of
the Klan arising within the borders
of the Gopher state, for this paper is
first of all the Minnesota Fiery Cross.
“State News Letters,” dispatched
to this paper from the offices of the
Fiery Cross publications in the re
spective states will be found in this
issue. These letters present in brief,
but comprehensively, news concerning
the Klan and news in which Klans
men are interested. Likewise, each
week is dispatched from the office of
The Minnesota Fiery Cross a similar
news letter reporting interesting
Satters that have taken place in the
jpher state.
Washington Bureau
But even more vital and more far
reaching than the state letters,
which are the nucleus of a state Klan
news service, is the work of the
Washington Bureau of Publications
and Education. It is the chief func
tion of the Bureau to keep Klan
members throughout the nation post
ed on the activities of their repre
sentatives in the national capital
through the columns of The Minneso
ta Fiery Cross and other publications
of the Empire Publishing Company.
Not only have newspapers through
out the country, almost without ex
ception, spread falsehoods and creat
ed misunderstandings concerning the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, but
they have pursued news policies
which have made them guilty of sins
of omission as well as commission.
They have not told the truth about
the activities of officials in Washing
ton. And there’s a reason.
Individual newspapers, in cases
where they would tell the truth were
it obtainable, have been unable to do
so. depending entirely upon the large
wire services. The Associated Press.
The United Press, The International
News service and subsidiary concerns

wire services, dominated and in many
cases owned, by interests which care

the eyes of American voters, have dis
patched only such messages as they
wish the reading public to see.

Woman Creates
“Scene” at Klan
Flag Ceremony
COLUMBUS, 0., Feb. 18.—The peo
ple of Cedarhurst, a village just east
of Columbus, 0., got their first close
up view of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan recently, when at the
close of a business meeting of the
Cedarhurst Civic Association, 50
members of the Klan marched into
the meeting, and after a short and
impressive ceremony, the leader pre
sented a Bible and an American flag
to the association.
The surprise of the evening, how
ever, was when a woman, heretofore
known as a Protestant, rushed to the
front of the hall and objected to the
association accepting the Bible and
flag.
Her protest was so loudly condemn
ed, however, that no one was left in
doubt as to the sentiment of the ma
jority of those present, and on a
vote of the audience the gifts were
accepted.
Klan Continues
To Sweep Over
West Virginia
WHEELING, W. VA-, Feb. 20.
Smashing down the mighty offensive
of the organized opposition and scat
tering its fragmented obstacles in
thousands of directions, the great
spirit of the Ku Klux Klan contin
ues to surge its phenomenal way
through West Virginia, leaving in
its wake one of the greatest and
most powerful organizations ever
seen in this state.
In its cyclonic sweep, the big spir
it of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan is literally combing the land,
carrying with It the best citizen
ship from the cities, towns and
countryside. The masses have heard
the call of the Klan and are res
ponding to it by the thousands —a
response whose parallel is unpre
cendented.
Unable to take care of the myriad
applications for membership in the
Klan on account of inadequate hall
space, and also prohibited from stag
ing out door initiations on account
of inclement weather, hundreds of
mastodonic outdoor initiation cere
monies are being planned by West
Virginia Klans to be staged in the
early spring.
False charges, whispered scandal
and unfair, prejudiced press reports
have failed signally to check the
great growth pf the mammoth move
ment and all obstacles lay stripped
of their sugar coating—leaving a
big mass of crude, nauseated propa
ganda, refused and scorned by all
fair minded persons.
Practically every township of New
ton county Ind., was represented at
a meeting of the Women of the Ku
Klux Klan at Morocco last week. A
large class was initiated.
Ku Klux Klan Is Sweeping Gopher
Slate As Thousands Answer Call
(By PASSERBY)
Minnesota Is populated all hut sol
idly with Nordic peoples, and most
of those are Protestant. It Is not
strange, therefore, that the Ku Klux
Klan. as a Protestant and American
movement, should appeal to them.
Faeh day reveals a keener Interest in
the movement, which lias already
made a mark on the great highway
which leads to the uplands of Ameri
canism and Christianity. It should
not he long before all hut a few
counties will go completely Ku Klux.
Already Indications point to an un
usual growth In Klan membership
within the next few months.
With the opening of spring and the
coming of warmer weather, you will
see the white-robed Klansmen meet

state. Also, you may look for large
classes appearing for naturalization
at selected centers of the various
counties There are few ceremonials
that equal the Klan onen-air natural
ization and you may look forward to
meetings such as took place at Al

summer.
Every county organization should
begin to plan for bigger things in
the realm of Klankraft, and concen

WASHINGTON, D. C„ Feb. 12.
—According to advices received
here today from Atlanta, all dif
ferences between Dr. H. W. Ev
ans, Imperial Wizard of the Ku
Klux Klan, and Col. William J.
Simmons, Emperor of that organ
.zation, have been amicably set
tled. The settlement includes
the payment of $140,000 to Col.
Simmons and his resignation as
Emperor.
Advice also states that degree
teams are now being formed which
will leave Atlanta at the earliest
date possible to confer the Second
Degree to all certified Klanamen
free of charge.
This settlement coming at this
time when the Klan is spreading to
all section of America and its
strength growing each day, is a
source of greatest satisfaction to all
concerned, and will be received with
the greatest rejoicing among the
million of Klanamen throughout the
country.
The perdiction made by The Fiary
Cross, of Indiana, last August, that
all would be amicably settled has at
last become a reality. The Fiery
Cross has never entered into the con
troversy between the two factions,
and has always maintained that the
differences of opinion between the
two men would be settled for the
welfare of the Klan.

Find Oldest Alphabet
Known to Man
PHILADELPHIA. PA.. Feb. 19.
Dr. George A. Barton, professor of
Semitics at the University of
Pennsylvania, has received a let
ter from Palestine stating that
two French archeologists, working
on the site of ancient Phoenicia,
have discovered the oldest form of
the Phoenician alphabet yet found.
It is declared to date not later
than 1200 B. C., and from it Greek,
Roman. Hebrew and English alpha
bets can be traced.
The earliest inscriptions previ

termined to serve with absolute un
selfishness. Although the Imperial
Representative in Minnesota has been
with us only a few months, he has es
tablished himself in our hearts. He
has been tried and not found want
ing. We like to refer to him by his
nickname the “Irishman.’ ’ He came
to us from Dayton. Ohio, where he
built in a Christian way one of the
finest organizations in the United
States. His success in the past rec
ommends him to all who want to see
the Klan forge on to its goal in this
state.
The other day, I had a conversation
with him which was most pleasing and
satisfactory. Some of the state
ments he made revealed the charac
ter of the man who is now serving as
leader of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, Realm of Minnesota. I asked
him what his conception of a field
man was, and without hesitation he
answered, # “A true representative of
our great organization is in a sense
an emissary of Jesus Christ and sound
Americanism. I honestly feel that
no man who does not stand before
God and man as a Christian gentle
man, is worthy of a place as a work
er in the great cause. I shall permit
no man to go out into the field as a
representative of the organization
unless he measures up to the high
standards which were presented so
wonderfully by Jesus of Nazareth,
who is a Klansman’s criterion.”
In our conversation we touched on
various phases of the movement and
went into detail on some of them. A

to me. He said, “If anyone takes Je
sus Christ out of the Ku Klux Klan.
the movement will go down in wreck
age, for it will then have lost its
soul and will therefore not be worthy
of perpetuation.” Bringing his fist
down on his desk, the “Irishman”
said, with an unusual firmness, “When
I find that the Klan has eliminated
the Galileean and discarded God’s
Holy Word. I will do everything in
my power to crush the organization."
I now asked him what he considered
the objective of the Ku Klux Klan,
and he stated briefly, but with sure
ness registered in his voice, “The per
petuation of America’s great institu
tions; the establishment of a civili
zation fundamentally Christian, and
the creation of a spirit which will
cause men and women to look unto
the cross as a symbol of right liv
ing.”
The “Irishman" is a modest man
and does not like to be eulogized nor
flattered. We know that he will not
forgive us for printing the forego
ing references to him as a man wor
thy of our confidence and esteem,
hut we have written, so let it sfand.
Knowing the Minnesota people as I
do, I can see very clearly the reason
for the state-wide acceptance of the
Imperial Representative, and with
unusual frequency we hear remarks,
as follows: “He has the vision,” "He
is a Christian," "He lives up to his
promises,” “He meets his oblige
tions," "He does not practice deceit,"
“He deals with all men on a four
square basis.”

be a dirt farmer.
A large number of men has been
proposed for the governorship by the
various political leaders of the state.
Every day brings forth a new man,
it seems. I find that the following
men are most frequently mentioned
in connection with the governorship:
Hon. Oie O. Sageng, a bona fide
dirt farmer, who resides near Dalton,
Otter Tail county, it is believed by
many, will be able to carry the Re
publican standard to victory against
all comers. Mr. Sageng has a legis
lative record that is hard to beat.
As a member of the state senate, the
Otter Tail county man revealed un
usual ability. Hon. Sageng was born
in Norway, but came to-'thia country
with his parents when a boy of seven.
He is a graduate of the Fergus Falls
high school.
0. P. B. Jacobson, chairman of the
state railroad and warehouse commis
sion has a name that is an asset in
Minnesota politics, for J. F. Jacob
son of Madison has not been forgot
ten. Added to the prestige that
•comas fitNpe psychological name Mr,
Jacobson has time and again shown
enough fighting spirit to satisfy the
prevailing desire for a man who will
go down the line for the people
rather than special interests. He was
born in Norway. Mr. Jacobson was
in the mercantile, implement and
grain trade at Fergus Falls, Otter
Tail county. Also, for a time he
served as editor of the Fergus Falls
Ugebrad. He is classified as a Re
publican.
Whenever possible candidates for
governor are mentioned, Hon. Theo
dore Christianson of Dawson never is
left out. THose who know the Lac
qui Parle county editor refer to him
by the nickname of “Teddy.” Mr.
Christianson is a member of the low
er house of the state legislature,
which position he has held for five
terms. In 1921 and 1923 he served
as chairman of the appropriations
committee. “Teddy” was born on a
farm in Lac qui Parle county. He
was graduated from the Dawson high
school, the University of Minnesota,
Arts and Law. He is a Mason and
Republican (Progressive). At pres
ent there is an activity which seeks
to place Mr. Christianson on the Re

There was no protest meeting at
Alma. Not more than a dozen stu
