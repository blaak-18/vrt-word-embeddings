Captain James Jeffries for
Speaker of the House .—We no
tic« in the New Orleans Bulletin a
mention of the name« of Kx-Mayor
Wiltz and Captain James Jeffries
for Speaker of our next House of
Representatives. Wo don't know
Mr. Wiltz nor do we bring any
charge either of dishonesty or in
competence against him, but he was
a candidate for re nomiuation for
and defeated Mr.
Mayor and was defeated by Mr.
Iveeds, which may or may not have
gone to show that the people of
.New Orleans were dissatified with
him as Mayor.
Capt James Jeffries is one of the
mein hers elect from Rapides, and
is a gentleman of high social posi
tion and of varied attainments, is
n lawyer of rare ability, though he
has never practiced his profession
here, and he is by his birth, man
ners, education, position and abili
ties eminently qualified for that or
any other position. He is well
versed in all t-Jie new legislation re
quired for our stricken State and is
well up in all the infamies of radi
cal legislation which needs to be re
pealed and would in the Speaker's
chair greatly assist in the work of
undoing what the thieves and cor
morants havo done to rob and op
press the honest people of Louisia
na. As Speaker ho would rank
with Pugh and Sandidgcofrtnfe&e?
lum days and would by his person
al dignity and firmness of charac
ter at once secure and retain the
respect and control of tho mem
bers of the House. No better se
lection could be made than that of
Capt. James Jeffries of whom we
may truly say, he is a gentle
man sans peur et sans reproche. —
Spotless in his character, irreproach
able in his demeanor and upiver
oally admired and respected by all
who know him, the House could
find no abler or purer gentleman to
preside over its deliberations.
Personal .—We have had the
pleasure of meeting in our sanctum,
Maj. Stephen F. Power of New Or
leans, representing the great Whis
key House of Jordan Giles & Co.,
successor to S. T. Suit & Co., of
Louisville, Ky., one ot the oldest,
wealthiest whiskey firms in the Uni
ted States. Maj Power is an ex
Confederate who knows all about
tho seige of Port Hudson having
'•been there" while tho seige was
going on. We found the Major to
bo an exceedingly pleasant gentle
man. lie proposes to remain here
for a day or two and those of our
merchants and others who propose
to lay in a supply of first class A.
No. 1. whiskies had better give Maj
Tower their orders at once. The
present firm of Jordan Giles & Co.,
having succeeded to the celebrated
S. T. Suit & Co., have on hand as
•we are informed, tho largest stock
of aged Whiskies in the United
States and all purchasers from
them can rely upon getting the very
first quality of liquors and they may
be sure of receiving just the kind
and quality they order. The house
represented by Major Power having
an old and well established reputa.
tion are anxious, of cour se, to main
tain it and dealers can put the ut
most confidence both in the quality
of their Whiskies and in the integ
rity and responsibility ot Messrs.
Jordan Giles & Co.

This circumlocution office has at
length got down to and through
the count of Rapides Parish, as we
gather from the Bulletin of Tues
day. We give what it says about
our Parish :
The board met at about 11:15
o'clock. At the suggestion of Wells
the board established the rule that
no orte be admitted to the sessions
press, counsel of both parties, and
persons in erested in parishes uu
der consideration.
The Parish of Rapides was taken
up. The returns give Moncure,
for Treasurer, Levy, lor Congress,
and the three Conservative Demo
cratic candidates for the Legisla
ture. majorities of from 200 to 250
odd votes.
The papers were disposed of.
The totals for Treasurer are, Mon
cure 1584, Dubuclet 1232.
As usual, it being a Democratic
parish, Ray, of counsel lor the Re
publican party, entered a protest
on the same old grounds of gene
ral intimidation.
At the close of our reports they
concluded the count of fangi
palioa parish and adjourned until
next day.
They have adopted the rule of
promulgating the count of each par
ish as it is made and we presume
that we will soon have the returns
from Rapides promulgated. Wi
learn from a private source that the
Radicals protested upon the ground
of intimidation at three of our pre
ciucts, Cotile being one, Paul's an
other and one the precincts North of
Red River being the other. We
have not learned what disposition
was made of tho protest, nor does
the extract from the Bulletin given
alcove tell us what was done with it.
Tlîe idea of intimidation on onr
part "is rich, rare and raoy," when
we had United States soldiers at eve
ry precinct and cavalry riding around
generally. That kind of a game
won't do and it will avail them but
little to attempt to play it here. Our
people know that they won the
election fairly and in the face of ev
ery effort to intimidate them and
they do not intend now to be swin
died out of their victory by any such
swindle. If tho radicals here know
what is good for them they will not
provoke our people too far, for they
know that if they can be cheated out
of this election it is useless to vote
again and they mi<,'ht try some other
means. Verbutn >Sap.
Parish Indebtedness.
From Mr. John M. Barrett, Par
isli Treasurer we obtain the follow

ness of Rapides Parish at the time
the new Police Jury took control ot
the Parish Finances ; viz:

Total $ 34,594,74
In this connection we would call
the attention ot parties interested
to the following Sec. Revised Stat
utes scc. 2044.

of the treasurer to keek a. well bound book,
in which he shall make an entry, desrih

THE NEW POLICE JURY.
On Monday last the People's Po
lice Jury elected on the 2n j of No
vember, met at the Court House.
There was present : Messrs J. R.
Andrews, John A. Williams, J. H
Sorrcll, A. B. C. Dean and B. F.
Lambright. The law does not re
quire that their election shall be
declared by the Returning Board,
nor that they shall be commission
ed by the Governor, they therefore
exhibited their certificates ofelec-'
tion from E. J. Barrett, Esq., Su
pervisor of Registration and were
duly sworn in by L. V.Marye, Esq.,
Justice of the Peace, and proceed
ed to their organization.
Mr. John A. Williams was called
to the chair, .and the Jury went in
to an election of a President, which
resulted in the unanimous choice of
Mr. James R. Andrews. Messrs
H. M. Labat and Clias. Owen were
then put in nomination for Clerk,
and the election resulted in the
choice ot Mr. Labat. His salary
was fixed at #250 00 per annum.
Mr. Levi Stewart was elected Offi
cer of the Jury, with a salary ot
$200 00 per annum. Mr. John M.
Barrett was elected Parish Treas
urer, and his commissions fixed at
2£ per cent, on the receipts of his
office. His bond was fixed at $10,
000 and was promptly furnished
with tho names of the following
gentlemen as Securities; to wit :
M. Paul Jr. & Co., Jacob Irving,
Dennis Kelly, H. St. John and B
C. Duke, which proved satisfactory
to the Jury and was accepted by
them.
The President appointed the fol
lowing gentlemen on the Finance
Committee : Mr. John A. Williams
Chairman, and Messrs LamJ>right
and Sorrell. The Jury then went
into the election of a Parish Pliysi
cian, which resulted in the choice
of Dr. A. Cockerille, with a salary
of $250 per annum. They then re
duced the salary of the Parish At
torney to $100 per annum.
The Jury after the transaction
of some other business of no par
ticular importance, such as audit
ing a few claims, granting permis
sion to change one or two roads
and receiving from the securities of
E. R. Biossat, payment of the
judgment of John Clements, Presi
dent Police Jury vsî E. R. Biossat,
Parish Treasurer, amounting to
$1419 they adjourned until the first
Monday in March 1875.
The retiring Police Jury had set
tled up all the matters pending and
left the new Jury but little to do at
this session. The gentlemen com
posing the present body are deter
mined to conduct the parish affairs
upon an economical basis, and we
congratulate the people of our par
ish upon once again having their
financial affairs in the hands of such
able, conscientious and efficient of
ficers. They find themselves upon
taking possession burdened with a
debt of nearly $35,000 according to
the statement of the Parish Treas
urer published elsewhere, and it
will be some time probably before
they can develop fully their meas
ures of reform.
Mr. John A. Williams as Chair
man of the Finance Committee is
a most admirable selection, and we
doubt if there is in the parish a
gentleman better fitted for tho po
sition or any where one more .able
than he to rescue our parish from
her load of debt. His qualification
for this position was the expressed
reason at the time why he was not
elected President, the position lit
filled in the Fusion Police Jury of
1872.
Holders of Parish paper may
confidently expect to see it advance
in value very shortly, and persons
who have parish taxes to pay will
consult their interest by purchasing
the paper of the parish while they
can buy it at about 50 cents.
Pi^We observe that each of
three Grand Ecore packets has one
ot Rapides' boys in the Clerk's of
fice. Willie French is on the Fle
ta, Tom Davidson on the Durfee
and Tom Hynsou on the Garry
Owen. These are all good selec
tions, and show the wisdom of the
Captains. Good luck to the Rapides
bovis !

Ou?» BIRTHDAY S.
The anniversary of our birth-days
is always an interesting period, and
should be noticed accordingly.
Each of such days is a mile stone
on the road of life, reminding us of
the rapid rate at which we have
been advancing on its journey, and
approaching to its close. It is true
that in life's morning, these mile
stones appear to be farther apart
than they do in later years—still,
they are days of hope and promise.
Thousands are then rejoicing that
they are one year nearer to the
boasting age ot twenty-one, when a
young man feels himself lord of his
own actions, and glories in his lib
erty. To thousands of the fairer
part of creation, these annual mon
itors are welcome, as harbingers of
the day when they shall shine in
the ball room or circles of fashion—
attract all eyes, and command all
attention ; or perhaps fasten some
silken chain around the heart of an
individual admirer, and lead him
in delightful captivity. To other
thousands of the same sex, the an
niversary will tell a tale of sadness ;
of departed hours, and departed
charms; withered roses, and with
ered hopes; when the mirror has
lost its magic power, and speaks
nothing save tho plain language of
unwelcome truth and soberness.
Thousands are reminded that
many of the intervals between one
mile stone and another were dis
tinguished by lovely landscapes
and countless beauties ; by health
and enjoyment —by joy and glad
ness of heart. To thousands of
others, such intervals have been
gloomy and cheerless; without the
consolations of friendship, the coin
forts of society, or the flattering
promises of hope. Surrounding
prospects have only increased the
gloom of the mind, and made the
mind sick. Yet in all these recol
lections, we may find instruction
and nourishment for our better
feelings. If our course has been
checkered by good and evil, we
may profit by tracing consequences
to their proper causes; and thus
learn how many miscalled misfor
tunes are the offspring of folly or
imprudence, or wrong; the natural
results of our own wanderings from
the path of innocence and duty ;
or else have been so fortunate as to
have discovered by experience,
that our happiness and duty are
intimately connected, and that wis
dom's ways are always ways of
pleasantness and peace. In both
cases this annual review of the
days and years that have taken
their farewell of us, will be saluta
ry in its effect, and teach us the
value of virtuous resolutions of
amendment when we have gone
astray, and the peaceful feelings
and sweet anticipations of those
whose desire it is to preserve their
moral health in the bowers of inno
cence and purity, and amid the
green pastures and still waters of
life.
There is a sweet pretty custom
in Europe, of celebrating these an
niversaries or fetes, which we on
this side of the water might well
imitate, rather than the extrava
gances of Parisian toilettes. In
In Germany more particularly these
fetes are observed with a charming
simplicity among all ranks, from
the crowned head, to the humblest
peasant. Little gffts aro eagerly
prepared days beforehand for the
dear mother, who pretends not to
sec and wisely asks no questions,
when mysterious consultations are
held, and a great commotion and
concealment among lier little peo
ple, should she by chance step has
tily into the playroom. Every
member of the family indeed, from
the yearling, to the silvered haired
Patriarch, receives on the anniver
sary of his natal day some fond to
ken of affection ; and thus a pre
cious link is woven ito home mem
ories, and the passage of life, at
best sadly pierced by thorns is
much softened by these tender ties.
We live too fast in this country,
our birth days come, and go, and
we rush on wildly with them, nev
er looking back, but struggling on
ward in search of some new chime
ra which once possessed, like a
child's toy loses its chartn with it«
novelty, and ends like its predeces
sor in disappointment or regret.
Let ns then take time to think of
onr birth days. Let as take the
time to gather onr little band
around us, on each successive birth
day, and gladdeu the heatts ot the
family circle by some simple plan
for their happiness. Love is a
great sweetener even df poverty.

OUR PARISH.
It has been so frequently remark
ed as to become a trite saying in
this locality, that "whoever drinks
ot the waters of Red River may
never quit itsshores, or should they
attempt to do so, will surely re
turn" and truly it lias been so often
verified, that the question natural
ly arises, why, and wherefore is
such the case. That we, the native
born should love, and cling to it,
even while we take unto ourselves
the privilege of finding fault with
our parish, our people and every
thing in it, is a common phase of
human nature, but that her adopt
ed children, should manifest such
undying affection for it, is "trnth
stranger than fiction." We met not
many weeks since, one of the tal
ented members of the Alexandria
bar, who has recently gone else
where to seek a "better fortune."—
When the writer asked him, how
he liked his new home, he sighed
as he replied "pecuniarily, I am
doing better, but my preference is
for Rapides, and as soon as I make
enough I shall return" Thus uu
like the waters of Lethe which cast
the waves of oblivion over the past,
our red, muddy stream neither
classic, nor picturesque preserving
still its winding course twines
around the heart, and intones un
ceasingly the murmur of its swift
flowing current.
These reflections recall an episode
in our own career. Ere the cruel
hand of civil wilr laid its devasta
ting touch upon us, "rich in this
World's gear," ice (writers assume
the royal prerogative in using the
plural pittnouu) determined to,re
alize the dreams of some years, and
visit the old world. We left our
home, not the least fair in Rapides,
with bounding hearts, and perhaps
some little contempt for the level
field*, and sluggish bayous of our
native spot, a little fearing too,
that after a visit to Europe we
might never again lie contented at
home. Our wanderings were very
pleasant,, wo rested on Killarney's
bright waters, and learned its le
gendary lure, we trod tho wild
scenery of the scottish Highlands,
and stood upon the spot where the
Lady of the Lake "pushed her light
shallop from the shore." We gazed
upon the vine clad mountains, and
ivy clad ruins of Rhineland, we
scaled the dizzy heights of the
grand old castle at Heidelberg, we
floated in graceful barks on the
beautiful Lake of Corno, and gazed
entranced upon its picturesqnes
shores fringed by "orange groves
and whispering mirtles," we bathed
in the limpid wafers of the Lago
Maggioue, and trod its blooming,
fairy-like Isolas, Bella, and Madre,
where lake, sky and mountain lent
their grandest and softest beauties,
to touch the heart, and charm the
eye, and yet returned to onr quiet
home in Louisiana, and felt that
though we had neither mountain,
nor lake, yet we had skies as blue,
sunsets as glorious, and a wealth of
vegetation with its perfumed roses,
sweet scented shrubs, evergreens,
green grasses, and trialing mosses,
which exceeded those of fair Italia.
Truly it was then a land of beau
ty, but now alas! this fair and
smiling aspect is changed and des
olate. The roses have climbed and
withered and died, the latticed
bowers overrun with fragrant creep
ers have crumbled down. The
walks are grass-grown, noisome
weeds choke up the shrubs. The
ornamental trees are overgrown,
and dead boughs, and broken limbs
show neglect, and that want of care
which betokens that the spirit, and
pride of our people have died be
fore the carkiug cares of poverty,
wrought by the unrelenting oppres
sion of a Republican government,
whose tyranny like the sword of
Damocles is ever trembling over
oar heads. But dearer than ever
is oar land in its fallen greatness.
Like the tender mother who loves
best her crippled babe, so do we
yearn over oar suffering State—
The times make men, and to-day
Patriots have arisen in our midst
who have anfarled the Banner of
Liberty, and dared the death to
throw off the trammels of corrup
tion and infamy. Thirty years long,
did the brave people of the Nether
lands struggle ander cruelties which
sicken the heart to even read ef;
for their rights, and nobly gained
them. Scarcely ten years have
seen oar probation. Faint and
weary as though we may bey yet
we are still strong in love for our
générons soil, and love not to hear
of deserting her in her day of sor
row. Let as rather invite em mi
gra tion, and gather around us
friends, and co-laborers in the
mighty work of the redemption of
our cherished Louisiana.

The Retiring Police Jukt.—
We take occassion upon their retir
ing from the position to make special
mention of the services of Mr. J. W.
Osborit as President and Mr. J. P.
Saelling as member of the Police
Jury. These two gentlemen were
the representative of the people
upon the old Board and conscien
tiously performed their duties.
They were scrupulously exact and
honest in all their official acts and
were careful of marring expense.
It is dne to them to say that a large
portion of the indebtedness of
$35000 which they leave behind
them was not of their making,
$3000. of that amount was for tho
expenses of the last election;
$15000 is the nnpaid portion the ex
pense of building the Coait House
which was brought about by the
mistake of the collector in taking
about $5000 pairsh paper for that
tax and of the failure of the Police
Jury to provide for the expense of
collecting the tax when they laid
it some years ago; and a large
portiou of the bnlunee is ii\ Jurors
and Witnesses certificates issued
by the clerk of the court.
Of the two colored men who
wero in the Jury, William Kelso
and Jesse Clifton, we must say in
justice to them that we believe they
'conscientiously «ought to do their
whole duty honestly. They wero
as they doubtless knew themselves
not filled by birth or education for
positions of «uch importance, but
we do them the credit to say
that we think they did the best
they knew how, and we wero lu a
position to judge them.
V3T Our namesake the Caucasian
of Lexington Missouri, gives us
the following handsome; notice, for
which wo are obliged.) We only
wish that we had the vim and force
of intellect which characterizes the
Lexington Caucasian. Many thanks
tor your good will, on a smaller
scale wc shall continue to "go for"
radicalism and rascality :
Light in a dark place. The pnro
white sun of politidal righteousness
arising in the jungle-home of be
nighted carpet-baggerism. "Please
X, as we are namesakes," is tho
cabalistic inscription which comes
to us on the margin of another Cau
casian, hailing from Alexandria,
Louisiana ; right in the jaws of the
enemy ; right in the central den of
Kellogg despotism, Merrill dra
gooning and nigger militia. Its a
spunky, straight-out little organ of
pure states rights Democracy, and
bids fair to become a power for
good. Long life, prosperity, and
the final complete triumph of its
principles from ocean to ocean, is
what we wish oar young namesake,
"The Alexandria Caucasian.''
