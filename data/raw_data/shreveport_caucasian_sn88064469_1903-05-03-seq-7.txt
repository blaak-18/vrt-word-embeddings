LET US TRY IT.
The Caucasian is pleased to endorse
the article following, which is clipped
from the Homer Guardian-Journal:
"The ballot is the best method of
electing public officers, and why should
it not also be the best method of nomi
nating them? The ballot places eirery
voter upan an equality and the voice of
one is as potent as that of any other.
It gives every candidate a fair chance
and every voter a fail chance. All can
didates could be chosen by a direct vote
of the members of the party as well as
elected by a direct vote of the people in
the general election. Primaries. are un
der the protection of the law. And in
this State the nominations of the Demo
cratic party are equivalent to election,
and therefore should be made by a direct
vote of the rank and file of the party.
"'There are no objections to primaries
which will not apply with equal or great
er force to other methods of making
nominations. Persons not members of
the party may not participate in the pri
maries to some extent, but such persons
can also participate in mass meetings and
even as delegates to nominating con
ventions.
"Primaries can be safeguarded just
as well as any other method, and, on the
whole, it is decidedly the best and fair
est method: There will be no population
basis of representation in a primary, and
any Democrat in the State will be equal
to any other Democrat in the State, no
matter in how large a negro parish he
may reside. This method has been adopt
ed in South Carolina, Alabama, Arkan
sas, Mississippi and other Southern
States, and has worked well and given
satisfaction. It brings the candidates out
in the open on their merits, and destroys
Women's Headaches

and I woqld have bliding headaeisa My limbs wod w up and I would feel so weak I could not stand up.
I natally elt di-couraged fr I seemedto be beyond the help of physicians, but Wine of Cardui came as a God-send
to me. ISelt a chage for the better within a week. After nineteen days treatment I menstruated without saffering the

HIIeadaches are the danger signals f onming di.te. Malarial headache predicts fever. Bilious headache foretells
liver troubles. Neuralgicheadachet shows overworked nerves. Periodical headahes tell of female weakness.
Bothmen and women suffer the first four kinds of headaches, but the last, periodical headache, falls only to the lot of
women and cannot be mistaken, for it is the uerring sign of irregular menstruation and bearing down pains.
Nowoana .need give up and acept alife of suffering unless she allows herself to despair. Mrs. Snow, in her letter
ews er.sftsryine.rg woman how not only suffering can be avoided but how weakness can be conquered and the best health
.aamured. She tells, how even when the best medical aid failed, Wine of Cardni worked a complete cure.
Completely prostrated by nine months of enppressed menses, blinded by headaches and racked with pain
she was made a strong and healthty woman again. One week of suppression is a serious thing. But nine

B.-emember with Wine of Cardui no case is hopeles because this great remedy cures permanently nineteen

weakness. Mrs. now's attention wasattracted to Wine of Cardai when she was discouraged and beyond the

what are known as gum shoe methods.
The campaign now in progress in Mis
sissippi is an illustration of this fact.
The candidates for governor and other
State offices and for the Senate in that
State are now on the stump. discussing
the issues of the dlay before the people.
and appealing to the masses for support
on their merits and because of the
soundnes. of their political principles.
What a contrast this presents to the
methods which prevail in this State.
Here a State convention assembles, com
posed of delegates, appointed by little
mass meetings in some parishes, selected
by parish committees in others and
chosen by primaries in still other par
ishes, and the trading and dickering
commences and a candidate for governor
is finally nominated, whom nobody out
side of a few politicians had ever
thought of in connection with the high
and important office.
"The people are tired of and disgusted
with such methods. The direct primary
is a better and fairer way. Let us try
it in Louisiana."
THE NEGRO AS A SUBJECT.
And the negro is the subject which
affords space writers for newspapers un
limited possibilities and it may be said
in all seriousness thatnot more than ten
per cent of the negro population in the
South ever peruse these essays, these
erratic and glittering generalities of
space fillers who, as a rule, are ignorant
of the negro except in the sense that he
is black or dark skinned, and that the
white man is white or light skinned.
Much is being said of the negro. but how
much more could be written of the Chi
nese, who are swarming into the United
States in numbers, and who if not
checked must, in a few years, aggravate
the social and the labor problem, which
is now so prolific a field for space writ
ers. Knowing the negro as we do, hav
ing had the practical experience with
the negro on the farm, working with
him side by side in the field with a hoe
or at the plow handle, and through all
the various functions of life in which
the negro is called into play, we have
long since realized that the best solution
of the negro problem is to let the negro
alone. We should give him every chance
and opportunity to grow up, and on this
we may reproduce the words of a critic
in the "Medical Brief' in a terse and
interesting article on "Oil and Water
Will not Mix," in which he says:
"The Americanism of the negro is
only skin deep. He is a good imitator,
but Anglo-Saxon manhood is something
he knows nothing about. The kindest
thing we can do for the negro is to let
him alone. Give him a chance to grow
up. Let him acquire the fundamental
virtues. Let him learn to be steady,
honest, sober, thrifty, self-controlled.
Let him become a skilled worker, a
property owner. Let him set himself to
climb the old, old ladder to advance
ment and he will cease to be a problem.
Nothing can be done for the race, every
thing is possible to the individual black
man.
"The doctor, from the standpoint of
scientist and biologist, can endorse the
truth of this. He knows, if no one else
does, that the negro is likely to suffer
more from his so-called friends than he
ever can from the hands of those who
understand him."
