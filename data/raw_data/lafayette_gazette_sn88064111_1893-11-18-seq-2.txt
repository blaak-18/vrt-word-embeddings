Is a wrong that should cause a pro

the city press are a unit in giving
emphatic expression to these views.
In the death of Mr. Johni McCor

him, for he was cordial in his ie

never did a wilfull wrong in his life.
He *leaves a widow and ten

heartfelt sympathy.
Mr. B. '. Sherrouse, representing
that well and Favorably known

and gave The Gazette a half column
advertisement which appears in this
issue. It is well to note the fact
that these are all home testimonials,
of representative citizens,and should
therefore inspire confidence in the

AN ELEfGA.L T AFFAIR.
The marriage of Miss Rose Tindel 'ani d
Mr. Sig B. Kahn, of Pattersonville, was an
event in Lafayette society that will 'o ig be
remembered for its brilliancy. Miss Bendel,
the lovely bride, has been reared in this
town, and possessing in a marked degree all
the necessary requisites to endear herself to
a host of :riends, it followed that a very
large number of people assembled to witness
the impressive marriage ceremonies.
The wedding hour had been set for five
o'clock, last Sunday evening, but long be
fore the appointed hour, the little tefaple
was crowded with friends and well-wishers
of the fair bride- that edifice, however, was
too small, by far, to contain all, and the
front of the synagogue, as well as the ban
quettes, from block to block, presented a
large concourse of people.
At the hour designated, the bridal party
arrived and entered in the following order:
Mrs. Falk, the mother of the bride, hand
somely attired in an elegant black silk d:ress,
with white stripes, en train, accompanied by
a brother of the groom;
Next came the bridesmaids, handsomely
gowned, who were: Misses Lena Flonsky, in
light blue brocade; Rose Reims, in cream
crepe de chine and embroidered chiffon;
Flora Plonsky, in white silk ; Letfh Levy, in
pink crystal cord; Louise Eystein, pink silk
with point lace and flowers: Octavie Leh
man, light ile green, elaborately trimmed
ivith satin ribbons of same color, and a ber
tha of point lace on the corsage; Tennie
iNorman, cream crepe de chine and satin riW
bens; Seraphine Heyman, light lavender
silk; Emma Falk and Laura Plonsky, each
wore a rose silk, of a soft nature, trimmed
with lace;
The little flower girls, who followed, were:
Josie Moch, in white satin and embroidered
chiffon, carrying a magnigcent bouquet of
cut flowers; Gussie Ploansky, mile green;
Bessie Kaufman, lilac satin; Carrie Reimn,
white silk and crepe; WVilhil Schlinulen and
Aiucle Ouailhe also were most tastefully any
elegantly dressed;
Then came the Maid of Honor, Mis,
Louise Bendel, a sister of the bride, who
wore a most becoming and elegant dress of
white imperial silk, eh train, trimmed with
point lace and hyacinths, and, at a mark of
distinction, wore a white veil;
G:-acefully leaning on the arm of her step
father, Mr. B. Falk, came the bride, and as
she entered, the. organ wafted the sweet
strains of the wedding march. The bride
was attired in a robe of white Duchesse
satin, beautiful in its simplicity; the corsage
was trimmed with real lace, muggets and
orange blossoms, and on the skirt was a cas
cade of the same forming an apron drapery;
the Whole a dream of the dressmaker's a-t.
In her ears were diamond drops, and in her
hair shone a resplendent diamond pin, which
lheghtened the effect of the tasty coiffure.
The bride appeared, indeed, a vision of
beomty.
The g-oom's best man was Mr. Ike Uen
dcl; the groomsmen were Messrs. Paul, Ma
nuel and Albert Cougenheim, Leopold Kling,
Sam Bendel, Henry Bendel, feyer and i.u
cten.Lehman; and the ushers, Messrs. Sam
and Ike Levy.
T'he m:arriage ccremony was pc-formed iby
the Rev. Dr. Leucht, of New Orleans, and
was most impressive. The interior of th
synagogue had been elaborately and tast'
fully arranged, and the couple made their
marriage vows beneath a glittering snow
white bcll, made of flowers and silver
spangles, suspended by four streamers; the
maids being grouped around the bride,
:bmus forming a transcendently beautifrI
scene.
Immediately after the ceremony the party
and guests repaired to the Opera House,
where the newly married pair received the
expressions of good wishes oa their friends,
At six o'clock the party descended to the
lower floor where the dining hall had bee.
located, which had been lavishly decorated
with ferns and pot plants, and variegated
Japanese lanterns were profusely, and wit'1
exquisite taste, strung about, its haily lighis
shedding a lustre of preitl hues over the
scene, heightening admirably the effect
of the whole. After partaking of a sump
tuous banquet, where good cheer and the
flow of wit reigned for the entire time, the
sweet strains of the Jreaux Bridge band
summoned the one hundred and sixty-two
people from, thme dining to the reception hall.
The votaries of Terpsichore were afforded
ample opportunity to pay homage to their
Goddess, and right royally did they prove
r'mems-lves worthy to worship at her sh -inc.
Every one who gittetide'd itis - aint sffai:
wish mime couple, who begin ,heir married
life under such favorable auspices. a long
life of unalloyed happiness and prospec y
o which The Cazette iegs to add its own
east wis'aes.
