elotion for a new Trial Ove
ruled.
Col. W. H. Jack, counsel for Mr
J. W. Jones in his suit against Mr
Freeman, the president Incumbent,
for the SherifiPs office, filed a mo
tion for a new trial, on the ground
that the verdict was contrary
the lawand the evidence, andfo
the further reason that the afida
vit of Messrs. Oliver and Findley,
the commissioners who deserted
the box in Ward 3, was not prop
erly in evidence in the case,
A large nortion of the day,1
(last Thursday) was 'onsumed in
arguments upon the motion, at the
conclusion of which, Judge Hnte
prompt overruled it. Col. Jack
obtained an order of appeal to the
Bupreme Conrt, and will make
determined effort to win his
which was so unfairly and unjust
ly beaten by legerdeman in this
eourt.
Mr. Freeman's lawyers have
soluately nothing to fight upon sva
teeanicalities, and from the way i
which they and their frie.8s threw
bsgaoles ia the way of making th
ap eal bond and other frivol
mattersm, . howse what despera
straits they are redeuced to,

Iel),a.ed :a the second son an'! li
f.ourth child of Francis Brian and
lIannah Rogillio, who moved tc
Cal.cwell lari.h wh:'n he was yet n
:a boy. i
At the early age of 19 he Imar
ried Rosanna Roe of W'inn parlih,
their marriage licenses Ibein' the.
first issued in that parish after it. s
organization. h
Hle then plied his trade of black- si
smith and wheelright, with much 1)
.uccess until the war broke out,
when lie enlisted, but was rejected c
fter examination because of hi d
health. Hie finally succeed in en- n
tering the Confederate Cavalry
service, where ho served Jeff Davis
4 years and 20 days.
Shortly after the war or in Feb.
16(3S, he started to Texas, but go
no further than Big Creek, in
':rant parish, which was a new
'ountry in those days. Here he
Settled, building his house of tim- t
bers hewn direct from the forest,
.vith the ceiling and cover made
of boards riven from the logs, but
neat andt durable withal.
He joined the Missionary Bap
tist church soon after his marriage,
and later was ordained to preach.
his he did for about 15 years,
when his health and financial con
ition forced him to give it up as
profession. C
In politics he was always indo
ndent, but democratic in princi
ple.
He was elected to the first State I
nate after the Constitution of
f 1879, and served 4 years, wa
-ain elected in 1892, ser, ing til i
ucceeded in this year by Rev. J.
. Patton. He was an active mein
r of the People's party, and wa. t
lected the last time as its nominee.
He had the pleasure of servin
*n the State Senate with his son
ember of the House, under a
natitution which his brother (th
ate S. M. Brian Esq.) had helped
to frame.
As to his private and public vir
ues, we leave them to one of hi
neighbors who has lived by him
or more than 20 years, and whos '
ind words appear elsewhere in
this issue.
He leaves behind his wife, aged
years, nine children, two broth I
- rs, two sisters and a host of othe
a latives and friends, to mour
heir loss.
The dropsy from which he died,
tacked him more than a year ago,
S he at once began to make prep
tion for his end. His business,
refore,.was in good shape, h
Sat ease, and he was calmly
waiting dissolution, with confi
Sence in the faith he had professed,
an undying hope of eterna
piness.
