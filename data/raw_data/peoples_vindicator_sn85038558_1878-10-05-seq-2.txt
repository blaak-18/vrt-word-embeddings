Iadependents,
Some disbatisfaction was manifested
at the action of the parish convention
and the talk for a few days afterwards
was of independent candidates. Of
course such policy would torn the
parish over to her worst enemies and
submit toar property and rights to
those outrages which in the past ar
roused as to action. The indepen
dent movement of Democrats, we are
proud to note, has entirely subsided.
but it continued long enough to
embolden the enemy into talking of
their independent candidates, who,
strange to say, were the same indi
viduals that were Republicans or
Radicals two years ago. They chang
ed their political garb simply, and
now propose to run on the indepen
dent, high cockalorom ticket, as it
independents were as respetelable
even as Radicals. Natchitaoches
parish has suffered much from bad
local and State government, she don't
intend to suffer any longer from eith
er. Her present condition, which Is
so onmeasurably better than it was
two years ago and beyond comparison
with that of four years past, is due to
the efforts of a united, solid Demo
cratic party. and all good men cer
tainly intend to maintain the integ.
rity and discipline of that party to
which they owe so muclh.
The Independent dodge is too thin
to disguise radicalism with and is cer
tain to meet as prompt an efficient
resistance from the people as radi
calism has.
begiste.
We appeal to every white man In
this parish to GISTErta, and that at
once. If they do so and go forward
and vote, we assure them that the
victorious boanner of Demoeracy will
wave over our parish one month
from to-day. Let no MAN hold back;
let the best citizeans of every neighbor
hood compel the lazy, the indifferent
and the soulky to register. Their
property, their rights are at stake and
no man has the right to jeopardize
TAXIS.
Our cltizen taxrpayers should not al
low the political excitement now pre.
valling to cauose them to forget the fact
that their taxes are now doe and paya

lector publishes a call ia this week's

Independents.
Oar friends in Natchitoches parish
may in a moment of fret or anger
give expression to language deic t
would lead one to suppose thenm in
favor of independents; such how
ever, is not the case. Their well
known patriotism and popularity
makes us know that none will battle
harder than they for the success of
the Democratic ticket.
The Democracy of Natchitochles is
fighting now for a Constitutional
Convention. We have nominated
for the Legislature two of the beat
men in the parish, and every effort
must and will be strained to secure
their election. All other offices and
officers are insignificant, and the pa
triot who wants Louisiana redeemed 1
will not think of them for a moment.
Let us all work to get a good Leg
islature that will call a Constitutional
Convention at once, and then we can
redeem Louisiana once and forever,
when the minor offices can receive
such attention as they merit.
Vote Like Democrats.
Natchitoches parisb arose like one
man two weeks ago and struck down
the enemy, we did our work that day
like Democrats, let it never be said of
us that we couldn't vote like those
grand old patriots. Would it not be a
khame to say tnat we could fight tle
enemy like a Roman phalanx but we
quarreled like children over an office

Beulah Camp Meeting.
The tenth annual camp meeting at
Beulah, in this (Natchitochen) parish, com
menced on Friday the 20th nult., at which
I it was our pleasure to attend. Early
Friday morning the various roads leadul
ing to the camp ground were alive with
wagons, carriages and horses, and hun
dreds of worshippers hastening on to the
grounds where in former years they had
so enjoyed themselves in the service of
God-A huge shed has been erected on
the centre of the grounds, around which
are built numerous houses called tents.
About forty fanmilies were tented on the
grounds and these families were prepared
to acconmodate all persons who visited the
meeting, free of any charge.
On Sunday about six hundred persons
f were present, and notwitatanding the
large crowd they were all well fed and
cared for and the most perfect order pre
vailed.
The following ministers were pres nt
r Robt. Randle, John Pipes.Geo M Liver
man, J. 1. Frarklin, J. B. Coesity, A. F.
Gallaway and Thos. J. Hough and tev.
Mr. Branch of the Baptist Church About
fifteen sermons were preached. all point
ed, clear, forcible and delivered with
great power aundl nauthority. Two see
mons preached by Rev. John Pipes of
s Mansfield deserves special note because
of their eloquence, and the sunjects, they
were both funer 1 discourse', one on the
I death of Thomas O Jordan. son of our
esteemed citizen A. G. Jordan of Allen in
this parish; before preaching the ser
mon Rev. Mr. Pipes read the following
a paper which wil give your readers an
insllht into the discourse :
"The object of this hour's service is to
a preach the funeral of Brother Thomas
Osborne Jordan, son of A. 0. & D. H.
Jordan. He was born May 18, 1840, atid
died July Y7, 1877; aged 37 years. From
ebildhoed and during his whole life, he
wau a sub ject of co:stant and severe af
tiction IFirst from partial paralysis and
secondly from loosing his eyeeight. In
1874 he resolved to become religious. and
under the ministry of the Rev. Jas. E
Bradly wus converted to God and joined
t the Methodist Epi-copal Church South.
At once he gave himself to prayer and
meditation, and soon became a bright
and happy christian Though his af
flictions were great, and his sufferings in
tense; yet be would often repeat hymns
of praise and exhort his frienls, and all
who attended him, to be religious and to
meet him in Heaven. Some of his lest
it words were, "I am now in the dark val
d ley, but I shall see beyo d, where I shall
be happy! happy I happy !!!
His final request of his father was that
II he would build a teot on Benlah camp
h groand and ocopy the same. Then af
ter a lifetime of augmented snufering, he
:; sweetly fell esleep in Jeass. He rests
from his labors and his works do follow
him."
It Mr. Pipes selected as his text Revels
ir tions 14-13-"And I heard a voice from
d Heaven saying unto me, write, Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord from
e henceforth; yes saith the spirit, that
they may rest from their labors; and
their works do follow them." The ser
asn was systematically arranged, and
delivered with feeling of telling effect.
On Monday at eleven Mr. Pipes preach
i. ed the funeral of Rev. Mr. Porter, and
read the following papers just before
taking his text:
dt "The Rev. Baxter 8. Porter was born
in Dallas county, Alabama, October 8th,
1825, and did October 13th, 1676 aged
1 5lyears. He was converted at Bethel

1848, was called of God to preach the
gospel, and enteied upon the work of the

We have the names of a few white
men who were on the eve of turning
traitors to their race and going over p
to Blunt and who signed his roll on d
21st just before the negro mob tired ti
on our town. Do the people want ,,
those names, or is it best to let them d
hide themselves in shame and dis- t
grace forever ?
Let them begone with their gramn
blings and their endorsement at the u
last hour of Radicalism in Natchiito
ches parish. t
OUR RIOT.
[Coushatta Citizen.]
The majority of our readers are
familiar with the cause of the trou- I
ble, consequently we shall have but t
little to say about it. Blunt and his
followers certainly knew and fully ap
preciated the danger attendant upon
their action in calling a mass meet
ing upon the same day that a Demo
cratic Convention was to be held.
They knew, or ought to have known,
that a collision was not the least of I
probabilities, if not an absolute cer
tainty, if the least bragadocio or
bombast was practiced by armed men.
In the face of these dangers, Blunt
not only held his mass meeting, but
his speakers used incendiary language,
excited the whites to such a degree
that, instead of transacting their legio
timate business, they dispersed for
protection of life and property.
It may appear, as the Shreveport
Times says, to those at a distance
from the scene of disturbance, and
who do not understand the characters
of these leaders, or the temper and
animus of an excited negro popula
tion that this was a very high-handed
measure. Those who are familiar
with such matters will commend the
good people of Natchitochles for their
forbearance in having permitted these
men to live in thie parish for so long
a time.
The trouble is over with for the
present, and, we trust, for all time to
come. But little blood has been shed,
so far, and discretion and prudence
during this campaign, will do niuch
towards making Louisiana a pros
perous State.
[Sbino Sonthron.]
ThIe heroic patience and forbear
ance with which tihe people of Nat
chitoches have borne the insults and
cruel outrages, from time to time, for
several years, of these stupid and
malignant disturbers:-f their peace
and safety, is calculated to euel vate
the sturdiest native virtue. Now
that their iniquity has culminated in
an attempt to murder and despoil
them of their property, they still ex
ercise moderation, and forego their
extermination. Will these people
never learn that their resistance to
law and order, through a spirit of
vindictiveness to the white race, will
1urely and certainly result in their
final ruin if not total exterminat ion.
Their leadters, white asi well as
eolored, by fostering this spirit of
delusion, that thre white people of
this country are their enemies, and
should be forced to surrender thre go
ernment into the hands of their lead
ers is the cause of all this trouble.
They incite these collisions hetweeti
races and seek to urake political capital
hy crying "hloody-slhirt," etc., against
the only true frieinds of the negra
race and of law and order. Under
these circumnstances can the initelli
gent and patriotic men of this coon
try be so indiffereut ta the welfare of
their country as to withold their sop
port from the party that is now strog
gling to save us from the lawlessness
and ruin of this stupid anrd deluded
race, whose prejudices are incited tim
madness against us by a remorseless
set of demrgagoues and vampires.
From Above.
NEGROES STILL WARLIKE.
Startling intelligence brought
here on 'I'hursday morning by dis
patch fromn Campre to the effect
that tihe negroes were organized to
t burn and slay on that night every
white man aroused us all to action.
' A strong party was sent up on horse
· back from this point.

t The Democratic Platform.
The platform on the vital, all im
portant and absorbing question of
State retrenchment and reform is pro
nounced in the general pledge of me
I form, abolition of useless oficers *and
reduction of salaries. There are rat
ters within our own control in which
we have DO consultation with the
f general government. From 1845 to
1861 the State taxation for all pur
· poses, save school tar, was from 12l
~ to 6 two-thirds cents on the hundred
s dollare valuation. It is now nearly
1 20 times that on an individual valu

one whether his itfe shall wear lthe

or occasionally something a little
better; and to that one whether his
daughters should have one or two

ramifications of industrial life this
question enters of saving fronm tax
ation somethiing to aid in vitalizing
and stinmulating further production
and accunmflation. Reduction of tax
ation means thIe brightening of many

places into waving fields, the spread
