that he would make the trip from

Judge W. E. Bowen had occasion

Patrick's Day-he requested the per

enclose in the letter a few leaves of
that plant so full of meaning to all
trues sons of Erin. A few days ago
he received a letter post-marked
"Dublin." The envelope had been
opened probably by some one mis
taking the shamrock for greenbacks.
The letter was gone, and the only
thing left was the shamrock.
A Bloodless Man.
Lafayette has been visited by a
phnenomenon-a man apparently
without blood, insensible to pain and
not susceptible of emotion or pass
ion. Wilfred K. Leotardo, of whom
so much has been said in the New
Orleans papers about a month ago,
spent two days in Lafayette during
the past week and did some wonder
ful things. A number of gentlemen,
some of whom had already heard
or read of this freak of nature, as
sembled in the rear of Romero's
saloon Wednesday night to witness
the performance which was to take
place there. At 8 o,clock Leo
tardo began the "performance," as
he called it, by requesting one of
the gentlemen present to drive a six
inch pin into his arm, just above
the elbow. After this was done a
similar instrument was pierced
through the muscles of his breast.
Several others were stick in his
abdomen.
I-e then produced a steel instru
ment, i6 inches long and fS of an
inch in diameter which was run
through the skin of his throat. Al
though it required a pretty strong
man to do this, the needle being
very blunt, there was not the least
indication of pain on his face.
When the instrument was pulled out
it left a small ntiirk but not a drop
of blood was to be seen. He says
he has never had a sore or ulcer in
his life. Several of our physicians
who were present subjected him to
a rigid test, questioned and cross
questioned him and agreed with the
other people in the audience that
L.eotardo was the most marvelous
freak they had ever seen.
As it may be of interest to some
we will say that Leotardo, is 24
years old, stout, and, from all ap
pearances, enjoying perfect health.
He is a native of the Island of Tri
nidad, British 1West Indies and is of
Spanish and English parents, speak
ing these languages fluently. He
has traveled extensiiely; for a num
ber of years being engaged by the
famous traveler and lecturer, Col.
James P. Sanford, who it will be
remembered, visited New Iberia a
few months ago. He left Thnrsday
for Houston, and says although
"on the buim" at present he will
soon be wearing diamonds.
The New Agent.
Mr. Charles B. Porch, of Shreve
port, arrived in Lafayette Tuesday,
having been appointed by the
Waite-s-Pierce Oil Conipany to suc
ceed Mr. J. G. Broussard as agent
in this town. WVhile we regret to
see Mr. Broussard leave we are
happy to say to the customers of
the Waters-Pierce Oil Company
that he will be replaced by a very
agreable gentleman, one with whom
it is a pleasure to do business. He
will take charge of the office on
May s, when, .Mr. Broussard will
leave for St Martinville, Where he
will enjoy a much needed rest, be
fore entering upon his duties as
salesmnian for a New Orlearis house.

HOMICIDE
Sarazin Baker Shot and Killed
by Jean Mehancee Doucet.
Jean Mehance Doucet, a marn about 60o
years of age, gave himself up to Sheriff
Broussard last Thn'rsday afternoon, stating
that he had shot Sarazin Baker, while in the
defense of his life. The sheriff had just re
ceived a telegram saying that Baker had ex
pired.
The killing occured fifteen miles from this
town in the Queue Tortue section. Doucet's
version of the affair, which is corroborated
by the other witnessess, is about as follows:
Doucet had recently hauled a dwelling
house on his place, which was to be occupied
by one of he sops. Baker, who was not on
good terms 'irith Doucet's son, pretended
that he had a claim on the house and would
not allow the latter to take possession of it.
On Thursday morning Baker sent word to
the older Doncet that he would come to the
house and break it; a while after he started
to carry out his threat, taking with him a
hatchet and instructing his little boy to follow
himwith an ax. When he arrived at the
house he fonnd Doucet engaged in making
some repairs inside the building, and in
formed him of his intention. Doucet ordered
him to keep out, but instead of retreating
he advanced with hatchet in hand as if to
strike I)oucet with it; The latter again re
peated his request but Baker continued toad
vance. Doucet then, thinking that his life
was in danger, took a gun, which was stand
ing by, and emptied a load of bird shot just
above Baker's hip boutte, causing death a
couple of hours later.
As f&r as we could learn, Doucct enjoys a
good reputation, and was considered a peace
able citizen.
Baker was known as a "bully," and was
tried in this parish about fifteen years ago for
murder. lie was convicted of manslaughter,
but got out on a plea of prescription.
Married too Often.
Deputy Sheriff Elamson Clark of
Calcasueu was in Lafayette Saturday
and called at the clerk's office to find
out if the marriage of Daniel Glover
was recorded. Clerk of Court Wm.
Bailey began immediately to search
in the archives and soon found the
document that united Daniel Glover
and Miss Mathilda Jyptson in the
holy bonds of wedlock. It is dated
August 27, r88s. A few months
ago Glover got tired of the fair
Mathilda and took unto himself a
second wife and is today in the
Lake Charles jail chakged with big
amy, with brilliant prospects of
serving a term in the penitentiary.
" Salve Regina. "
The Gazette is pleased to acknowl
edge the receipt of a copy of the
Salve Regnia for February, pub
lished and printed by the senior
pupils of St. Mary's Dominican
Academies, St. Charles avenue and
Dryades street, New Orleans. It is
neatly printed, ably edited and con
tains fifteen patcs of whole-some
reading matter, in clear long primer
type. Among the many beautiful
compositions worthy of mention is
a poem "In memory of John Boyle
O'Reilly" by '"(ecily."
A Progressive Firm.
Having had occasion to call in at
our friend, T. M. Biossat, last WVed
nesday, we found him very busy at
the "bench," working on a compli
cated watch while all sizes and
styles lay about him waiting for re
pairs. Not having much time for
conversation he invited us to walk
in the adjoining room and inspect
his new addition, and to our surprise
we found a manufacturing jewelery
department where all kinds of pretty
goods are made-to order. There is
a well equipped work bench in
charge of one of the finest engravers
and jewelers in the South. We were
shown some splendid specimens, a
broach set in diamonds and a raised
monogram in three different colors
of gold being paiticularly noticea
ble. The dispatch and taste with
which orders are attended to at the
liossat establishment have earned
for it the excellent reputation which
it enjoys throughout this section of
the State.
Religion is not a mathematical
problem susceptible of demonstra

St Patrick's Day at .the Convent.
The 17tth of March is always a
gala day for the pupils of Mount
Carmel Convent. Yesterday being
the eve of the great day-St Pat
riek's-they feasted their beloved
superior, Mother Patrick, and
presented her with many tokens of
their esteem and love. With the as
sistance of one or two of the siaters,
they had prepared an interesting
programme, c6nsistiug of dialogues,
recitations, drills and music, the
whole being a most enjoyable en
tertainment. As all this vas a com
plete surprise to the Reverend
Mother, the consequence was that
a holiday was granted and the ra
diant faces and happy smiles gave
evidence of the general satisfaction
and enjoyment afforded both teach
ers and pupils.

-Mrs. J. J. Couson has had built
a very pretty and ornamental fence
in front of her property.
-Mr. J. R. Jones, of Shreveport,
has been appointed receiver of the
Teche Railroad arid Sugar Company.
Mr. Jones is a thoroughly practical
and experienced railroader, and
will devote his every effort towards
the early liquidation of the outstand
ing indebtedness of that company.
The property is worth fully $500,
ooo.oo while the debts amount to
about $xoo,oo.oo. Our people
should understand that the Receiver
of any property practically repre
sents its creditors; and while they
have undoubtedly been very lenient,
they should have a little more
patience, and do all in their power
to aid Mr. Jones in the accomplish
ment of his purpose, which is really
for their own good and benefit.
Since the Teche Railroad and Sugar
Company failed in their promises,
your correspondent wishes to tell his
friends that he thinks the present
arrangement is the v:ry best that
could have been devised for their
protection, and it is only unfortunate
that it was not resorted to sooner.
It is statedehat Mr. Jones will build
the road through to Breaux Bridge
as originally intended, and also to
Arnaudville, which would make it
seif-sustaining, and add to the gen
eral value of the property.
-Cane plahting is well advanced.
If everything is favorable, this sec
tion will produce an enormous crop
of cane this coming Fall.
-Mr. Marc Lazaro, of Ville
Platte, was in town Saturday.
-Mr. Romain Francez went to
Abbeville last Sunday, to attend to

Orleans.
-Lime and labor is cheap, While
wvhitewash is healthful and beautify
ing.
-It is the intention of the new
management of the Teche road, to
build a telegraph line from Carencro
to Huron.
-Your correspondent is under
obligations to Dr. F. W. Courtney
for latest New York papers.
-It is truly admirable to see with
what silent contempt the catholics
are treating the "A. P. A." an
association which appears to be
founded upon bigotry and anarchism.
A new feature in politics that is
really dispicable.
-Our farmers are hard at work
getting in shape for the coming
season: TOTIDEM VERBIS.
Royville Itemis.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
-Mr. Billeaud, Jr., of Broussard,
wvas a visitor to our town Sunday.
-Hon. O. Cade; of the New
Orleans Mint, was down at his
home spending Saturday and Sun
day last with his family.
-Miss Ada Bourc, who had gone
to New Orleans to have an operation
on the ear performed, returned home
last week. Miss ]IoUrc is now
better, and daily regaining her for
mer health.
-Cards are out announcing the
marriage of Mr. Jules Alciator, of
the Crescrit City, to Mliss Althea
Roy, of this town, on Monday 26
instant. The ceremony will be per
formed at NewOrleans.
-It is high-time to wage war on
the large amount- of dogs found
roaming in the corporation limits.
We were reported several cases
where horses, hogs, and cattle died
from Hydrophobia lately.
-Dr. N. D. Young was a visitor
to the Crescent City last week.
-That intellectual medium of
journalism, the Lafayette Advertiser,
famed as originator of all that could
be termed "modern," has again been
heard in one of its "funniest."
That encyclopedia of intelligence
and learning, not many weeks past,
was advocating in its choicest lan
guage, the imntediate levying of a
road tax; as the only and available
means, of working with success the
roads of this parish. As varied at
the many hues of some ancient coat,
that weekly sheet hesitates not a
second in acting with similarity.
A little sunshine (with mother na
ture's consent) and the present sys
tem (which is an imposition onrthe
poor farmers) is now strongly urged
as a very satisfactory way of drain
ing and grading the roads. What
are the facts and proofs of such suc
cess. None other then boggy; im
passable and impracticable roads
for several months past. The "'five
mile plan" which is intended merely
as a suggestion to the Police Jury;
in accordance with the "Advertiser's
extended knowledge," is of old and
foggy origin. Is it ? Let the
readers of The Gazette answer.
Our suggestion of dividing the parish
in five miles tracts, from various
reports, met with the full approval
of many tax-payers, and certainly
should be entitled to some consder
ation. So far as we personnally are
concerned, it is a matter of perfect
indifference whether our plan is
given a trial or not. The people
are crying for good roads, and good
roads must be had, at whatever ex
pense. The Police Jury, we feel
sure, have the interest of this parish
and fellow parishoners at heart, and
we know that that honorable body
is untiring its aim and efforts to make
practicable the public roads of
Lafayette. CHEROKEE.
