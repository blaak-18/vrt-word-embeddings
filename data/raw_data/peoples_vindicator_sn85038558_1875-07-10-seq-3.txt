Market your cotton when there is a

WEEKLY AND DAILY FOR 1575
The approach of the Presidential elc
ttion gives unusual importance to the
events and developnments of 1875. We
shall endeavor to describe them fully,
faithfully, and fearlssly.
TilHE WEEKLY SUN has now attain
ei a ci erculatioln of olver seventy thou
s;ln11 copies. Its readers are foundl in
every State andl Territory, and its lnuali
ty is well known to tihe public. We
shall not only endeavor to keep it fully
up to tle old standard, but to inprove
almd add to its varietv and power.
THIlE WEEKLY SUN will continue to
be a thorough newspaper. All the news
of the day will be finlld in it, colndens
ed when unimportant, at full length
when of mnonellt, anlld always, we trust,
treated in a clear, interesting and in
structive manner.
It is oar aim to make the Weekly Sun
the best thllily newspaper in the worll.
It will .e full ot entertaining and ap
lpropriate reading of every sort, but will
print nothlling to offend the imost scrupu
lous and delicate taste. It will :lways
contain the most interesting storik's antl
romancues of the day, carefully selected
Sand legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a
promineunt feature in the Weekly 8un,
alnd its articles will always be foundl
fresh and useful to the fatrmer.
The number of mten independent in
politics is increasing, and the Weekly
Sun is their paper especially. It belongs
to no party, "and obeys Ino iictation, con
tending for principle, and for the election
of the best meIne. It exposes the corrup
tion that disgraces the country and
threatens the overthrow of republican
institutions. It has no fear of knaves,
and seeks no favors from their support
The markets of every kind and the
fashions are regularly reported in its
coelun 1 s.
The price of the WEEKLY  iN 15 one
dollar a year for a sheet of ei t pages,
and fifty-six columns. As this barely
pays expenses of paper and printing, we
are not able to make any discount or al
low any premninum to friends who may
make special efforts to extend its circula
tion. lUnder the new law, which re
quires paymenut of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty cents the
cost of preplaid plostate added, is the rate
of subscription. It is not necessary to
get up a club in order to have the Week
ly Sun at this rate. Auy one who seinds
one dollar and twenty cents will get the
paper, post-paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
TIHE WEEKLY SUN.-Eight pages,
fifty-six columns. Only $1.20 a year,
Postage prepaid. No discount from this
rule.
THE DAILY SUN.-A large four-page
newspaper of twenty-eight colunnls
Daily circulation over 120000. All the
news for 2 cents. Subscription, postage
prepaid 55 cents a mlonlth, or $650 a year.
To clubs of 10 or over, a discount of 20
per cent. Address.
"THE SUN," New York City.
THE
People's Vindicator,
FOR 1875.
We take pleasure in announcing to the
numerous friends of the VINDICTOR,
that we have perfected arrangements for
the, continuation of its publication upon
a firm basis. The public are well awtre
of the difficulties under which the Con
servative press ot Louisiana labor; the
infaimonus priuting law wa1sed by a parti
san Legislature, solely to foster aRld uIp
hIold, at the expense of the tax-payers,
journals entirely antagonistical to their
interest, and at war upon their liberties,
and by forcing, under the fornms of law,
our citizens to advertise in these official
papers, to break down their power, the
Conservative and Democratic press; con
sequlently we are compelled to depend
for sllpport upon the generous contribu
tion u a people already poverty-stricken,
but we feel tasured that they will not
fail to sustain their main power in the
war of virtue against vice
The Fearless White Ian's Press of
Loauisiana.
The future tone pf this paper can be
judged from its past We will continne
to advocate to success, the rights of the
TAXED, that honesty and capability,
ALONE, shall constitute grounds for lm
litical preferment, and a continued and
never ceasing war upon Kellogg and his
corrupt of1cials-knowing theni to be in
common with their Chief, both nsurpers
and thieves.
We can assure the publice that we will
not hesitate to attack the acts of any po
litrcal organization, when we believe
them to be antagonistic to. public good.
We are the seraint of no clique or party,
and intend solely to protect and defend
the rights and liberties, in our honest
way, of the whole people-believing that
we have done sufficient service in the
cause of the PEOPLE in the past, we
confidently expect their support in the
future.

TIHE ART JOURN.AL OF AMERIICA,
ISSUED MON2YTILY.
"A Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
carried out."
The necessity of a popular medinum for
the represenitation of the prodIuctions of
our great artists, ]has valways been rcaog
nized, and many attempts have been
made to nmeet the want. The slccessive
t1iilhres which so invaribly followed e:V h
attempt in this country to establish an
art journal, did not prove the indliillr
encel of the people of Atmerica to the
claims of high art. So soon as a proper
apprei:ition of the want ancd an lhilitv
to meet it were shown, the public at
once rallied with enthusllasm to its sup
port. and the rcesult was a great artistic
and eonunerei:al triumpl-'Tl E ALT lINE.
THE ALP)INE, while issued with all the
regularity. haIs nonle of the temporlarV orl
timely interest ch:racteristic of or'di,;arv
peri* dlicals. It is an elegant ncmiscellany
of lpure,light amld graceful literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci
mens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Althonugh each succeeding number affords
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and beauty of the ALnINI will le
mlost appreciated after it husheen hound
eup at the close of the year. While other
journals maI claim superior chea:lniess, ias
compared with r'.,als of a siilair class,
the ALUIN is a ulniqule and original con
ception-alone and unalpprotched--abso
Intely without compttition in price or
character. The. possesor of a complete
volumne lnnot duplicate the luant!ty of
tine paper and engravings iln any other
shape or llulmber of volmnles for ten times
its cost; and then, there is the Chromo
besides!
National feature? of THE ALDINE
must be taken in no narrow sense. True
art is cosmnopolitan. While THlE AL
D)INE is a strictly American institution,
it does not confine itself entirely to the
reproducetion of native art. Its mision
is to cultivate a brond and appreciative
-art taste, one that will discriminate only
on giroumds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the pItrons of THE
ALPINE, as a leauling charaeteritic, the
prsulnetions of the most noted Alerincan
artists, attention will 'always lie given to
specimens fromn foreign masters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and intstrue
tion oltainable from home or foreign
Sources.
Tile artistic illustration of Americann
scenery, original with THE ALIINE, is
an important feature, and its magnificent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfictory treatment of details
than can be aflhorded by any inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an uniabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light and graceful accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tures, with only such technical disqrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Premium for 1875.
Every subscriber for 1875 will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
sanie noble dog whohe picture in a for
mer issue attracted so much attention,
"MAF2'S U~'bSELFISHl FRIEND"
will be a welcome in every home. Eve
rybody loves such a dog, and the portrait
is executed so true to the life, that it
seems the veritlableo presence of the ani
mnal itself. The Rev. T. De Witt Tal
mage tells that his own Newfoundland I
dog (the tilest in Brooklyn, barks at it!
Although so natural, no one who sees
this preemium chrome will have the
slightest fear of being bitteu.
Besides tlhe chromo, every advance
sublscriber to THE ALDINE for 1875 is
constitnted a menmber, and entitled to
all the privileges of

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.I
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Eventing Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemishet' reputation
for the unsuriaseed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous readilng matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this conotry, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any firesidle without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the atirhday Even
ing Post, through not qiite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemmporaries,
is not, like that of some of themn, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
- SURE, SOLID A~)D SUIISTANTIAL,
'based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, suech as the poIulari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good,; hoLwever, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the paset, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will eflet a marked inmprovement inl eve
ry department of the plaper, anid will
cdall to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and ilcas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the omlnlar taste, by in
oreasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlargd facilities, we hope to make nlow
friends with each allld every i~sne, and
continue to maintain the claihi of the
Satnrday Evening Post to its title of Tint
OLDEST AND THE IBELSFT Of Family Story
Papers.
