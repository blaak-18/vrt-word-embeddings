EYEBROW OULTIVATION.
Dew to Ole Added Cleasater to One's
Phyelognomy - Ness Inz Importance to
the Eye Itself Are the Brows and
Lsehes--eow the Cult Ie Pratkleed by
Its Detbees.
Curiously examining the pretty toilet
articles that lie in great profusion on
the dressing table, you come across a
tiny brush, delicate and white, with
a finely chased silver back. You won
der at its purpose.
"What is this for?" you ask, holding
it up. The owner looks at it for a mo
ment with a thoughtful, puzzled ex
pression. Suddenly her face clears.
"Oh, yes, that's my new eyebrow
brush," she explains.
The disciples of physical culture have
a new cult. They devote themselves
ly to the eyebrow and eyelash, for the
possibility of the brow and lash as a
id factor in facial expression is being
11 more fully appreciated. Indeed, But
ir fon, the naturalist, places the eye
5a brow next in importance to the eye
ir itself in giving character to the physi
re ognomy. This is partly because, he
a says, of the marked contrast of this
feature to the others of the face. The
brows are a shadow in the picture,
bringing its color and drawing into
strong relief. Eyelashes also con
tribute their effect; when long and
thick they overshadow the eye, and
l make it appear softer and more beau
tiful.
n It is, indeed, claimed by many that
`s the eyeball itself is incapable of ex
Y pression; that it is the drooping or sud
0 den lifting of the lid which speaks.
These even pass by the dilating or

contracting of the pupil, and the
c sparkle of the eye, and will not ardmit
that they are able, independent of the
1 lid, to convey a suggestion of emotion.
Whether this be so or no, it is certain
ly true that the slight elevation of the
under eyeli--the expressive one-pro
duces that languishing look which the
tireek loved, and which one sees on the
face of Venus.
'The Turkish and Circassian women
use Lenna for penciling the eyes, while
those amuong the Arabs of the desert F
blacken the edge of the eyelid with
powder. and draw a line about the eye c
to make it appear larger. In fact, it is
whispered that these women of the t
desert are not the only ones who i
make use of the device. The Spanish I
grand dames squeeze orange juice in- r
to their eyes. It is a trifle painful at a
first, but it cleanses the ball and im- I
parts remarkable brightness tempor- f
arily.
Eyelashes are thickest in the middle, i
and taper toward each end, and are
constantly being renewed. Each halir
matures in five months, and then drops
out, to be succeeded by a new one.
Long and silky eyelashes are said to be
a sign of gentleness.
The ideal brodws are arches, well
marked, though not heavy, and dis
tinctly separated. Although, indeed,
the Roman motive of beauty included a
small forehead and united brows. Ovid
tells us that the women of his time
cleverly painted them so that they ap
peared as one.
The perfect eyelid should form an
oblong, for the large, round eye in
a circular aperture is indicative of
boldness; the small circular one of
pertness. Lashes should be lang and
silky.
The care of the brows is a very sim
ple matter. At night, just before re
tiring, take a little pomatum on the tip
of the forefinger and rub it gently into
the arched eyebrow. Then lightly pass t°
a towel over the same. This is to pro- t
mote the growth. "'We do this every s
night and morning," as one maiden
jocularly remarked; "we have braids." a
In the morning the sticky substance is
carefully washed out with a soft cloth
and warm water; then a little fragrant s
canu de cologne is applied, and the tiny
ailver-mounted brush comes into play.
It gently pats and smooths the fine
hairs into a slender, arched line. If
this be repeated every morning a def- P
eient brow will quickly mend its ways
and a wide, refractory one be brought
into meek submission.
Eyelashes may have their ends
clipped with the scissors once in every
five or six weeks. This is all the treat- e
ment they require to make them long at
and curved.-N. Y. Press. sh

Buttered Apples.-Pare and core sie

cores were and stick a clove in each ap
ple; stew very gently, covering the

currant jelly on the top of each, dust

a apple sauce. Put one-half pound of su
9 gar and a pint of water in a granite

til the scum rises, remove it and add
I- six apples, pared, cored and quartered.

ELECTRIC TEA KETTLE.
New Applieatinn of Modern Progress to
UDrawin-BRooMa Uses.
A firm of London silversmiths has
t produced an electric tea kettle, which
is said to have considerable vogue in
London drawing-rooms. -
The primary and very appreciable
a.ttraction of the electric kettle is its
Sabsolute cleanliness. There are, of
course, no fumes of any kind from the
electric light which is used to produce
the heat, and therefore the process of
Iusing the kettle is absolutely cleanly.
Nor is the simplicity of the new kettle
t and its method of use any less admir
t able than its perfect cleanliness. It is
, only necessary to attach the cord in
which the electric wires are inclosed to
any connection which may be fitted up
in a room for lighting purposes, and
the apparatus is in working order in a
moment. The kettle,. which is a very
shapely and agreeable production, is
made in such a way that when it is s
filled with water and placed 'upon the p
stand in which is the electric lamp,it can is
be tilted up and the water poured from u
it without the necessity of removing it a
from the stand, and by this means the o
it

AT ELECTRIC TEA rETTLE. ea
risk of scalding the hands or of spill
ing the water is avoided. The lamps t1
with which these kettles are fitted are d
of varying powers, ranging from eight ft
to fifty-candle power, the most useful
size, which is generally recommends4
for ordinary purposes, being of sixteen it
candle power. This size is very service
able and economical in usage, and r
capable of affording all the heat which
is required under ordinary circum
stances. A lamp of this strength is
amply sufficient to keep boiling water tt
hot as long as may be necessary, while te
one of fifty-candle power will boil a F
pint of quite cold water in twelve vi
minutes, while to go to the other ex- w
treme one of even eight-candle power ti
will suffice to keqp water hot. ti
Waste in CookIng Potatoes.
An English scientist, after care.ful c
experinmcnts, finds that when potatoes ,
are cooked without removing the t
skins they lose only three per cent. of N
nutritive quality through extradtion se
of the juice. When the skins were re- ,
moved before boiling the loss was at
fourteen per cent., which makes the hi
process of cooking the potatoes with- cI
out their jackets an exceedingly asted b
ful one. _ _

THE INCOME TAX.
- Law That 1. a ste is the BRght DI
reetSea.
The income tax law, it is confidently
predicted, will by the present con
gress be practically nullified by with
holding the appropriations necessary
to carry it into effect. The ,w-ish is
probably father to the thought; but
there is a good deal of reason to doubt
the accuracy of the prediction. Those
who make it also predicted that Presi
dent Cleveland in his message would
either recommend such a course or
show in some clear fashion his dislike
of the tax and the law. That predic
tion was not verified. The president
said nothing whatever about the in
come tax law. It is quite possible
that the other prediction may fall
equally short of verification. It cer
tainly should not be verified. Con
gress owes to itself and to the country
the completion of the work it under
took in passing the income tax law.
Its failure to appropriate the funds
necessary to carry out the law was a
blunder. That blunder should be
rectified. If the courts shall there
after declare the law unconstitutional.
as it is said the courts will, that is not
the affair of congress. Its duty will
have been done when the law it un
dertook to pass, and supposed it had
passed, has been completed in accord
ance with the clear intent of the legis
lators.
The entire scheme of revenue for
the coming and succeeding years is
based on the collection of this tax; and
for that reason, if for no other, it
should be perfected so that it may not
be necessary to unsettle the business
of the country by the formulation and
discussion of any new scheme. It is
not an ideal method of raising revenue.
The Free Press has pointed out more
than once that it is in- many ways one
of the most objectionable methods to
which resort can be had for the pur. 4
pose; and chiefly because of the diffi
culty in enforcing it equitably and in

securing honest returns from the peo
ple upon whom its incidence falls. It
has the merit, however, of bringing
under the notice of the federal assessor
a class whose contribution to the cost
of the federal government is infinitcs-,
imal in proFortion to the benefits it
reaps from such government. Under
any other system the millionaire pays
scarcely any more toward the support
of the federal government than the
day laborer; and whatever may be the
difficulties in the way of compelling
him to bear, honestly and fairly, his
just proportion of the burden it is but
simple justice that he should bear it.
If the income tax tends to make him
bear it it is a step in the right direction,
even though because of the nature of
things and of taxpayers it falls short
of completeness.
The house passed the income tax law
by a large majority; and it is not con
ceivable that it will hesitate to make
the necessary appropriations to carry
it into effect. It is possible, of course,
that the senate may, by filibustering,
defeat the attempt of the house to per
feet the act-the country has learned
to expect almost anything from the
senate. But if the senate shall do this
it will add materially to the burden of
public disapproval under which it notw
rests.-Detroit Free Press.
Hedllitu and Trtmmlng.
It seems to be the hardest thing in
the world fir a republican statesman
to get himself reported accurately.
First there was Sherman. whose tariff
views were misrepresented. Then it
was Reed. And now it is Babcock,
though it is explained in the case of
the latter that he was deliberately
misrepresented by an agent of the
United Press. It is rather a startling
coincidence, however, that all the men
spoken of should be misrepresented on
the same subject and in the same way.
Nobody seems inclined to misrepre
sent them on any other topic than the
.ariff Nobody charges them, for in
stance, with admitting that the force
bill was a blunder. Lodge, of Massa
chusetts, was reported to that effect;
but he does not claim to have been
misrepresented. Perhaps the other
gentlemen referred to are peculiarly
sensitive on the subject of McKinley

REPUBLICAN INCONSISTENCV.
Proteetlonlste erew Doseeratte Ideas
for lMel0mh Perposes.
The persistent howl which the re
publicans have made about the dutyv
of one-tenth of a cent a ponnd on
sugar coming from countries that pay
an export bounty has been frequently
alluded to in our columns. They have
insisted strenuously that the prohibi
tion of the import of American cattle
is based entirely on this provision, aUq
they have been eloquent in denouncing
the democratic party for a measure
calculated to injure our export trade.
A similar provision was in the M.~
Kinley bilL It has also shown that
the provision does not unfairly dis
criminate against Germany as com
pared with other sugar-producing
countries. as the extra duty is less
than the export bounty. At the same
time, the German bounty is calculated
to cheapen sugar to the Ameriean con-.
sumer, and we have urged that there
ought not to be any effort on our part
to prevent Germany from paying part
of our sugar bill if she insists on it.
For this reason the extra duty of one
tenth of a cent a pound should be re
pealed. President Cleveland urges the
same thlng in his message.
It should be noted, however, in this
connection that the protectionists
have always ridiculed the assertion
