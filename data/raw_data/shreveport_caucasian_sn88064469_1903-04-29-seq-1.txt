OLD JACK IS DEAD
He Was not a Dog of High Degree but C
a Good Dog.
After a long, useful and exemplary
career, Old Jack, yielding to the in- si
firmities of old age, lay on a bed o? new k
straw, spread beneath a desk in the of- r
fice of his master and friend, W. W.
Waring, awaiting, intuitively, the sum
mon through which he would be trans- d
ferred from this "vale of tears" to the c'
realm where dogs may feast on bones a
thrown to them and where they may eit d
their;heat, rare or done-up brown, with- c'
out the fear or the apprehension: of it
stones or bricks being hurled by cl
naughty boys and meaner men, or tin 0
cans tied by the merciless who beconm c7
gleeful over the howls, the barks a"' ci
the strides of terrified curs. If dogs ti
could only talk what a tale they tl
would unfold from the rattling can )
tacked to their tail of woe! But d g. T
are speechless, and' is a pity that some n:
beings are not dogs -t that respect ! z h;
It was on Saturday, April 25, 1(y)3 c;
when Jack was pulseless, ready to have w
his "toes turned up to the daisie.. pi
Jack "first saw the liht 'of day" in the a4
year A. D. i888, when the opera hiu'.e H
was being constrpced, and during his in
perambulations he never failed to at- in
tend the Baptist church choir, of which H
his master and friend is a member, and d+
it is to his record that he, in his dog- tr
way, sympathized with the mourners at ni
about one thousand funerals at which st
his master officiated. Although Js'tk s a
genealogy could not be traced to the la
days of Adam and Eve, Jack was no or- re
dinary dog. There was nothing of the lii
cur about him. He was a gentleman's re
dog and through his manners indicat- ta
ing his training and good breeding he vi
commanded the respect and admiration ti,
of good as well as mischievous boys. tip
He had his peculiarities, as have some w,
men, but it could not be said that he le
was 'cranky," or had "wheels in his s
head." He seemed gifted with an intel- se
lect discriminating in the, intensity of to
sensibility. While he would never for- m
give an enemy-one who had been un- te
kind or had treated him harshly-he G,
never forgot a friend, on meeting whom de
he would manifest his rejoicing with a at
gleeful bark - and the wagging of his th
tail,, the wagging of which was in
creased with his barks when some ad- fr
mirers, a commercial traveler for in- tr
stance, would pat him and pet him and sty
say "meat, Jack, meat," and go with te
him to the butcher shop around the
corner. It may be said of Jack as an op
posite trait, that when a naughty boy b
would worry him beyond all bounds he lit
had a way of retaliating by seizing the m
boy by the sitting part of his breeches w
and hanging thereto until there was a ar
rip and tear and Jack's mouth was full f
of pants from a running, panting almost re
pantsless boy. or
pantsless boy.
Jack was conservative and disin
clined to fight, and as some men, he
would if he could avoid unpleasant en
tanglements, but when the issue was
forced upon him he never hesitated by
seizing the opposition or seek a com
promise, but was quick, fierce and decis
ive in execution. In his dog-way he had
realized the futility of temporizing with
an enemy with a view of placating him,
and maintained his dignity and self
respect as well as his successes-and his
triumphs by adhering strictly to the line
of duty. In his dog-way, principle was a
guide which fortified him against all
misleadings by the most tempting of
meatful bones. As Jack was no ordinary
dog, he has seceived'unusual attention,
a mark of distinction which lalls to the
few, unless they be millionaires. Very
few indeed 4f the great number who
struggle unceasingly for existence in
this big, round world. Jack was em
balmed and laid out in a metallic casket
t the establishment of his master and
friend, where the faithful good, old
dog may be viewed in state, awaiting
the time, in the near future, when he
will be put away from mortal sight for
"
ever.
rIf all men were only as dogs in
their friendships and their loyalty! In
the old story of "Poor Dog Tray,"
which may be applied to Jack, there is
of the truthfully pathetic from
which a strong lesson may be drawn
in sermonising.

A QUESTION OF REWARD
Criminals Are Sometimes Apprehended
and Convicted on Offers of Money.
It is only recently that Shreveport was
startled with a crime which when made
known to the world aroused the greatest
resentment. It was the murder of a
woman, a lady, in her home, under con
ditions which were horrifying. It was a
crime which at the time and for days
afterward carried fear, apprehension and
dismay in almost every home in the
corporate limits. And yet, excepting an
indignation by a few which was a dis
credit, there has been no demonstration
of this damnable crime. It may be re
called that not many months ago the
citizens of this city were worked up to
the highest frenzy of indignation over
the cutting of the guy wires of the Cum
berland Telephone Company's pole on
Texas and Common streets by a striker
named Herkles, who was caught red
handed in the act; who was pursued and
captured by Special Policeman Hull.
who did not use his handy and ready
pistol, although Herkles, was fleeing, and
according -to the latest authority he,
Hull, would have been justified in kill
ing deader than Hector the man attempt
ing to evade arrest. But fortunately
Herkles was not shot at or killed. In
deed, Hull demonstrated through his in
trepidity and his alertness that it is not
necessary for an officer of the law to
shoot and kill to secure a prisoner. Hull,
as there are others in the service of the
law, would only use the sandy and the
ready pistol in the actual defense of his
life, if in peril. As is cell known to
readers of newspapers, Herkles was
taken to jail, uninjured by Hull, con
victed after a fair trial and is serving
time in the parish jail. The demonstra
tion by the people at the time of this
wire-cutting and the conviction of a mis
led young man, was responsive to the
spirit of the law, but singular as it may
seem, there has been no demonstration
to sustain the law, and since an innocent
man has been killed, the murder mys
tery seems to have lapsed into what
Grover. Cleveland would term innocuous
desuetude. As far as kbown, the legal
authorities have been waidts for some
thing to turn up, whila thb u l, per
haps in tti citj htill, is enjoying ali the
freedom and die blessings of life. And
truthfully and seriously considered, why
should he worry when the chances are
ten thousand to one that he may never
be detected?
In the past eighteen months there have
been several murders which were start
ling with perplexities and which are
mysteries still, one of which is that a
white man, in a state of nature, with
arms and hands fastened with rope,
found drowned in the bayou, and more {
recently the murder of two women, col
ored, one in Silver Lake, the other at
Mr. Tobinsky's ,with Mrs. Matthews at
the third, and a fourth woman, white,
whose body was fished from Red river.
And with all these and others, deaths by
violence, not one of the murderers have
been apprehended. This is a serious con
dition which should be realized by every I
man in the community. Who can tell
when some other woman or some other
man may b" added to the victims whose
deaths appeal to the law and to justice
for redress, not vengeance, but the en
forcement of the law, the meting of jus
tice; which is regarded, in a sense, as a
protection to the defenselessy
But our subject is the reward through
which the arrest and conviction of crim
inals is secured, the money consideration
which impels activity in seeking the
murderers who elude arrest. It has been
stated in public print that the Governor
of Louisiana had or would offer a re
ward of $250 in the Matthews case,
which my have been published in the
official journal of the State, and which
has escaped our attention, but if such
reward has been ofered it is time
that it was being published in the ,fficial
journal of the State as well as the local
press, and it is also time for the police
jury to consider favorably the recom
mendation o' the grand jury by offering
a liberal reward, to which this city,
through its council, should add its full
quota to the State and the parochial re
wards. This is suggested for the reason
that'the legal -authorities- are evidently
at sea, if not in a statg. of' 'innocuous
desuetude," and a money consideration
may stimulate activity all along the line.
It is certainly a discredit to think that
of the crimes committed, murders dia
I bolical, perpetrated in several instances
almost within the shadow of the temple
e of justice, that not one of the murderers
i has been apprehended. This is not dic
I tated in a spirit or with the purpose of
a sensation, but it is to arouse the citi
zenship, the law and order abiding of
l this commnity to think, think seriously.

A PLEA FOR PROGRESS
The Street Paving and the City Hall I
Propositions.
The property taxpayers of the city of
Shreveport will have the right to ap
prove or reject, on Tuesday, May 12,
the proposition for street paving and
the construction of a city hall, the two
prominent questions, which should he
carried by a majority in number and
amount of valuation. The city of
Shreveport, in its corporate existence,
has reached the stage where internal
improvements, suggested and designed
for the betterment of the community,
should be approved. The world's eye, as
it were, is upon us watching keenly the
action of the people and in rea. hing a
conclusion every taxpayer should be
governed by the benefits which are to
accrt!e in a general sense and not by the
amount of the tax which Al be re
quired individually. It should be viewed
end considered as a plain business prop- I
osition, and not from the more or less
selfish rule or standard of personal in
terest. It will not be gainsaid that t
Shreveport's need for good streets is t
imperative, and it is a fact which can I
not be questioned seriously or contra
dicted, that the property on all the
streets which have been bettered, with I
brick or asphalt, has increased in val
tation. `This betterment is not altogether
a direct personal benefit but in all val
uations, when listed for assessment and a
taxation, there is derived by the taxpay
ng community the advantages of the en- t
hancement in the aggregated valuation
fixed for taxation. No citizen who
claims to be progressive should permit i
his personal view to oblstruct, or should '
hesitate in a public duty and in sustain- s
ing the proposed issue of bonds for the
pavement of streets. He should also ap
prove the proposition for a city hall.
When the plea of excessive taxation is
raised in opposition, let the citizen, self- v
respectful, address himself the query: a
Is the den, so-called city hall, over the c
market house a place creditable to me a
as a citizen, to the city, as a site at which 1
the mayor and representatives of the i4
people convene? Is it a place which c
could impress the visitor and the inves- v
or o' capital to that degree which en- P
courages to material investments?" v
While it is true we may have some good I
streets, yet such a den as is called the P
city hall is a discredit to the city and I
reflection on the people. A comparison c
or contrast may be drawn by calling to
mind a man of means or one who may
)rovide the means being "diked out" in
polished boots with his appearance in
dingy suit and shirt unlaundered. Such C
man could not impress favorably, and
while it is true that the "clothes do not I
make the man" and the same reasoning 6
may be applied to a city and its city hall,
it must be patent that an uninviting, itn- a
prepossessing, a discreditable looking i
city hall with discomforts and annoy- a
ances untold, is not impressive, nor con
ducive to the spirit of investment On t
this- subject the Caucasian will advance f
its views more directly, as a business
proposition.

A TALE OF THE WAR.
The Times-Democrat says: Out in
Chattanooga they tell this story of Civil
war days: Chattanooga creek was the
dividing line between the outposts of the 1
Federal and Confederate armies, and '
du ng a lull in hostilities the pickets of t
both cultivated one another's acquaint- t
ance, having agreed not to fire on 'one t
mnother. One day when the captain of I
the Union guard saw General Grant with
his staff approaching he said to his men:
"Turn out the guard for the command
ing general." The Confederates on the
other side of Ihe creek, not more than
fifty fet away, heard the order, and
tfeir captain, conceiving the idea of pay
ing a compliment to the enemy, shouted:
*Turn out the guard for the command
ing general of the Federal army." The
ragged Confederate pickets stood at at
tetion for several minutes, and then
saluted General Grant as he rode away.
THE ISSUE IN LOUISIANA.
The issue political in Louisiana is not
the nomination and the election of a
governor'and State officials, but whether
the people instead of a coterie of politi
cians shall govern? The influence of the
Governor through the appointive power
is almost beyond computation. This
power was vested in the Governor at a
timonwhen danger of control was threat
ened through Republican success, but
since the Democracy has assumed full
possession, from which it could not be
divested except through a revolution by
the people, it is patent that the authority
of appointment then vested in the Gov
ernor should be returned to the Democ
racq, which in Louisiana is the people.
Now much longer shall this travesty of
D~issakccy be indulgid to continue an
