THE UNION AT CORDELE.
The Farmers’ Educational and Co-
Operative Union had a district meet
ing for the Second and Third con
gressional districts of the state in Cor
dele last Thursday. Mr. W. T. Dowd,
of Stewart county, district president,,
presided at this meeting. Mr. W. L.
H. Lane, of Dooly, was elected vice
president and Charles Jackson Shipp
was elected secretary and treasurer.
The Cordele Rambler was appointed
the official organ for the union for the
Second and Third congressional dis
tricts, and will in the future publish
all news of the union in these two
districts that Is sent to us, and we ask
that every county association will send
us any news of general Interest to the
order.
Our union is growing at a rapid rate;
very few farmers refuse to join, and
it is our hope to have fully sixty per
cent of the white men of these two
districts In the order before twelve
months. Business Manager Eubanks
was with us in our meeting and gave
us an instructive talk.
The Rambler hopes that every mem
ber will bring a new member to ev
ery meeting until we get in everybody
who is entitled to join us. The next
district meeting will be held in Vienna
on the first Thursday in April.—Cor
dele, Ga., Rambler.
LEAD US GENTLY, FATHER
TIME.
(Inspired by Hon. Thos. E. Wat
son’s editorial on “The New ear.”
in January number “The Jefferso
nian Magazine.”)
Lead us gently, Father Time,
We are wearied, sick and sore;
Full ofttimes thou hast scoprged us,
Yet we love thee evermore.
Lead us gently, Father Time,
We have striven hard and true;
If we failed we ask forgiveness
Os that One who guideth you.
Therp are loved ones looking to us
Whose lives are precious in our
sight;
Give us wisdom how to guide them
In the paths of truth and right.
There are friends who yet may trust
us,
May we still to them be true;
There are wrongs that we might alter
Had we time and strength to do.
Though our enemies harass us,
Yet we pause not in the fight,
For our work is for the masses,
And we feel that we are right.
Lend us gently, Father Time,
Thou art mighty and we are weak;
Yet we plead for one more trial
Ere thou dost accounting seek.
Lead us gently, Father Time,
When thou calledst we must come.
Wilt thou, then, lead us gently,
To our everlasting home?
—Charles E. Reid.

A CURIOUS CLUB.
(From The Springfield Republican.)
There has been launched at Chatta
nooga, Tenn., a curious effeort to
bring the leading politicians of the
two great parties together in a so
cial way. it is given the name of the
Interstate Club, and has taken the
liberty of naming Senator Blackburn,
of Kentucky, president; Secretaries
Root, Shaw and Taft, Speaker Cannon
and Senator Morgan, of Alabama, vice
presidents, and President Roosevelt,
Grover Cleveland, Vice President Fair
banks and William J. Bryan as hon
orary members, it is the plan of the
club to buy 2'0,0100 acres of mountain
land in Eastern Tennessee for a game
and fishing preserve, and to build a
fine clubhouse, where all of the above
named persons and other statesmen
are expected to lounge around from
time to time *ULd talk over their politi
cal differences as friends. The money
necessary to carry out the scheme is
said to be in sight, and that is all.
Municipal authorities of Barmen,
Prussia, have been requested to adver
tise for a dentist who is willing to
attend an elephant, an inmate of a lo
cal zoo. He suffers from peevishness
in consequence of frequent attacks of
toothache, caused by overabundance of
sweet. At such times he is practically
unmanageable. The local dentists re
fuse to attempt to fill his teeth. One
dentist was brave enough to try to
examine an aching tooth, but the en
raged elephant chased him around the
enclosure, and the dentist afterward
sent in a bill for damage caused by
the shock.
