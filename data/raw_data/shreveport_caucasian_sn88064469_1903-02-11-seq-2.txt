TEDDY IN PETTY POLITICS.
It was announced from Washington,
D. C.. a few days since that John D.
Rockefeller had sent telegrams to six
:)rominent ;enat(rs who were directed
to oppose all anti-trust legislation in the
Untied States Senate. These telegrams,
it appears. were on the order of com
mands. In the same telegraphic column
it was announced that President Roose
velt would call an extra session of Con
gress if some measure of relief is not
enacted by the present body. But since
then there has been an emphatic denial
by Rockefeller of the telegrams alleged
have beeen sent by him as indicated
by a sp ial to the Memphis Commercial
Appeal Us follows:
Washpngton. Feb. 9.-(Staff Special)
-The story that John D. Rocefeller of
the Standard Oil trust sent several sen
ators telegrams urging the defeat of the
publicity amendment to the anti-trust
bill came from the White House in an
indirect way. It seems that six senators
did receive some telegrams signed by
Rockefeller and others by his attorneys.
The administration inaugurated the
publication of the story in order to force
some sort of anti-trust legislation in
hopes of saying after Congress ad
journed that the President's announced
position had -been vindicated. At first
the story was discredited, but subse
quent developments seem to show that
there is at least sm;ne foundation for it."
Is it possible that Teddy has lowered
himself to the plane of the ward heeler?
German noblemen are ocking to this
country, it is said, and are serving as
barkeepers, hostlecrs, waiters and the
like. It has come to pass that a man may
not order a beer or a limburger sand
wich without running the risk of being
waited on by a count.-Commercial Ap
peal.
How much a count and of what ac
count?
What with earthquakes in Missouri,
Illinois and Kentucky, hurricanes off
San Francisco coast, the squabble over
Venezuela in Washington ambassador
ial quarters, an dthe all-absorbing negro
question. that is being wept and wailed
oer by Secretary Root, the average man
finds quite enough light literature to
fully occupy his mind.
