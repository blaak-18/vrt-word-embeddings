ISS Sophia was clipping
dead leaves from a rose
bush. Her little maid
Liddie sweeping one of
the garden paths near by,
looked up to say:
“Miss Carr’s going to
send her white roses to
the fair.”

Liddie paused and receiving no re
ply from Miss Sophia, added:
4 4 There’s a prize of twenty-five dol
lars for the best white rose.”
1 ‘That is a good prize,” observed
Miss Sophia, as she threw a handful
of dead leaves on the pile of debris
which Liddie’s broom was gathering.
Liddie went on. “Bussie White
was telling me about it. She says
Miss Carr is right hard up since she
lost her money in that bank failure.
She’s awful anxious to get that
prize.”
“Take it all up now, Liddie,” said
Miss Sophia.
When Liddie had obeyed, she re
turned to Miss Sophia who stood re
garding the rose bush with thought
ful eyes.
“My, Miss Sophia, you ought to
send these roses to the fair. They’ll
be out just in tame. They’d take
the prize, sure! You remember how
fine they were last year. And the
buds seem larger than ever this
year. ’ ’
Miss So'phia shook her head. 4 4 No,”
she answered, “I don’t care to.”
Then she turned and glanced com
prehensively around the garden.
“We’ll not do anything more out
here today, Liddie. You may go in
and get at your) (housework. Pm
going to change my dress. I have
some errands to do.”
A half hour later, Miss Sophia
came down stairs in dark skirt and
crisp white shirt waist, a white straw
hat shading her face. She looked in
at the kitchen as she passed out of
the house.
“I think we’ll have a strawberry
short-cake for dinner, Liddie. ”
“Why, I was just thinking that
would be nice!” laughed Liddie.
“Law, Miss Sophia, how nice you
look!”
The color in Miss Sophia’s cheeks
deepened. “Do I, Liddie? I was
wondering if this hat would do. I’ve
worn it so long.”
“It looks fine, Miss Sophia. The
flowers are just as fresh as ever.”
The maid looked after her mistress
as the latter walked through the gar
den and out to the road.
“Lands me,” she muttered, “Miss
Sophia looks as young as any of the
girls about here. And she must be
nearly forty!”
Miss Sophia walked along with
light step, her shoulders well thrown
back. It was a morning for a walk,
the June air fresh from the showers
of the preceding night, and fragrant
with the mingled odors of roses and
syringas, as she passed an occasional
garden.
A half hour brought her to the
edge of the village. As she neared a
small white house set back from the
road in the middle of a garden, s(he
walked more slowly. There were a
HISS SOPHIA’S REWARD
number- of red roses in bloom. But
no white ones.
“If I should send my white roses
to the fair, Sallie Carr would have
no chance of the prize. Hers and
mine are the only roses of the kind
in the county. But she has never
taken care of hers. I’ve worked with
mine till it is perfect.”
Miss Sophia’s steps continued slow
for some time after she had passed
Sallie Carr’s cottage, her thoughts
directed by the white rose to long
past days.
Why had she always had that dis
trust and incipient dislike of Sallie?
She knew of no way in which, tlhe lat
ter could have harmed her. And yet
there was something in Sally’s man
ner on the rare occasions when they
met which repelled her. Suddenly
Miss Sophia’s step quickened. The
white rose and Sally Carr had
brought other thoughts that she must
drive away.
No, she would not think of those
days. She had suffered enough from
their pain and humiliation.
She went briskly about her errands
in the village, and was about to be
gin Her homeward walk when a voice
from behind called her. She turned.
A stout elderly woman was hasten
ing toward her.
“Dear me, Sophia, how fast you
walk. ’ ’
“Good morning, Mary.”
“0, Sophia, are you going to send
anything to the fair?”
“No, I don’t think so. Liddie wants
me to send my white roses. ’ ’
“They would take the prize if you
did. There is no rose like them any
place around. I’m going to send
strawberries. I have some fine ones
this year.
“Are you? I hope you will be the
winner,” returned Miss Sophia cor
dially.
“Dear me, Sophia, how well you
look. And you don’t look a bit
warm.” Mrs. Brown was mopping
her face with her handkerchief.
‘‘ I walked into the village, ’ ’ smiled
Miss Sophia.
“Well, if you were stout like me
you couldn’t. Can’t you come home
to dinner with me?”
“No, thank you, Mary. I have
preserving to do this afternoon.”
“Oh, by the way, Sophia, guess
who is coming back here. Luke
Morer!” Mrs. Brown’s black eyes
fixed their glance closely on Miss So
phia’s face.
Miss Sophia returned the gaze
calmly. Her voice was even as she
replied: “It is a long time since he
left, isn’t it?”
“Nearly fifteen years. They say
he’s made a good deal of money. But
there, I must go home. I wish you’d
come with me.”
“Not today, thank you,” and Miss
Sophia’s voice was still even. But
she was all of a tremor as she left
the village for the road to her home.
A cold, sick sensation pervaded her
whole body. For some time she moved
as in a dream. Gradually the faint
ness passed and she could think of
what had happened. Mrs. Brown had
Glja 3effersoßlan
Sy Emily S. Windsor,
told her that he was about to return
to the village.
She had never thought of that. But
what was more natural than that he
should return some day to his old
home ?
“But I shall never, never see him,”
she thought passionately. She repeat
ed this again and again until she
reached home.
Liddie exclaimed when she saw her
mistress. “How white you are, Miss
Sophia! Are you sick ?’ ’
“I don’t feel very well,” returned
Miss Sophia in an unsteady voice.
“It was too long a walk for you
this warm weather,” returned Liddie.
“Dinner’s ready. A cup of tea will
do you good.”
Miss Sophia drank some tea, but
did not touch the nice dinner which
Liddie had prepared.
“And you were wanting strawberry
short-cake, too. You’d better go and
lie down, Miss Sophia.”
Miss 'Sophia sighed wearily. 11 1
think I shall. You need not gather
the currants this afternoon. Liddie. ’ ’
Liddie looked at her sympatheti
cally. 11 A nice nap will do you good. ’ ’
But sleep would not come to Miss
Sophia. Her brain surged with
thoughts —thoughts of those long past
years. She again went through all
their sweetness and humiliation. The
sweetness of those months when she
believed that Luke Morer loved her.
He had given her every reason to be
lieve that he intended asking her to
become his wife.
The humiliation of the time when
he suddenly left the village without
a word to her. Miss Sophia writhed
as she recalled the shame and agony
of those days. But she had suffered
in silence. She had borne herself
proudly before the curious glances of
the villagers.
The years had brought her a meas
ure of forgetfulness. Other trouble —
the death of her parents, had helped
to deaden the pain. But now it was
all to go through again!
Miss Sophia came down stairs to
ward evening, pale but with a reso
lute expression of lips and eyes. “I
ought to have no feeling but contempt
for him. I —despise him. It makes
no difference about his coming—l
could even ineet him calmly,” she
assured herself.
She spoke cheerfully to Liddie.
“We’ll get at those currants the first
thing in the morning.”
One morning the following week,
Miss Sophia went out to her garden
to find her white rosebush a marvel
of bloom. Never before had the roses
been so large, with such richly tinted
hearts and so exquisitely fragrant.
“Aren’t they magnificent?” cried
Liddie. “Do Miss Sophia, send them
to the Fair. You will get the prize,
sure.”
4 ‘ No, I shall leave the field clear for
Miss Sallie Carr.”
“Oh, I forgot to tell you. Miss
Sallie Carr went to Brighton on Sun
day. Her sister is sick. She won’t
be back for a good wlhile. So her
roses won’t be sent in.”
“I am sorry,” answered Miss So
phia, “but perhaps some of her
friends will attend to it for her. ’ ’
Liddie laughed. “Laws, Miss So
phie. There ain’t no one around here
likes her well enough to do that. So
do send your roses.”
“Miss Sophia looked thoughtful.
“I’ll think about it,” she said.
“Tomorrow’s the day for the
prizes for flowers,” urged Liddie.
Early the next morning Miss So
phia crept softly down stairs with
her hat on. From a cupboard she
procured a large flat-bottomed basket
and a pair of shears, and going into
the garden she cut off the largest and
most perfect of her white roses. What
wonders of beauty they were, with
the dew upon their petals! She placed
them in the basket, covered them
lightly with tissue paper, and walked
quickly down the road until she came
to Miss Sallie Carr’s cottage. All its
shutters were closed, and a forlorn
air enveloped it. She opened the gate
and walked up to the white rosebush
in a corner. It was in luxuriant bloom,
but Miss Sophia saw at a glance that
the flowers could not compare in size
and beauty with her own. .She cut a
few of the finest roses and placed
them in the basket.
After standing a few moments to
consider, she left the place and went
on towards the village. She had not
gone far when a buggy came around
a bend in the road toward her. As it
drew near her, its occupant called out
4 4 Good morning, Miss Sophia, you are
out early.”
4 4 Oh—Mr. Clark, —I was just going
to your house,” exclaimed Miss So
phia, going up to the side of the
buggy which had stopped. She held
up the basket of roses. 4 4 You see,
Miss Sallie Carr wanted to send her
white roses to the fair. She had to
go to her sick sister —so I thought I’d
attend to it for her. And as you have
charge of the flowers—”
“Why, of course, Miss Sophia. I’ll
take them. Ah —fine roses. I’m
sorry I have to turn out at the next
turning. I’d drive you home else.”
Miss Sophia turned her steps to
ward home. “I hope she’ll get the
prize,” she murmured. 44 And they’re
her flowers —I give them to her.
Twenty-five dollars will come in very
nice for her if she is in need of
money. ’ ’
On reaching home, she found Lid
die preparing breakfast, and much
mystified at Miss Sophia’s non-ap
pearance.
“I gave the roses to Mr. Clark,”
explained Miss Sophia. “He has
charge of the flower display, you
know.”
“You will surely get the prize,”
declared Liddie confidently.
She came in from an errand in the
village a few days later looking much
crestfallen.
4 4 Somebody sent in Miss Sallie
Carr’s roses, after all,” she said,
4 4 and they took the prize. Its very
strange, for your roses always were
the finest.”
“I iam very glad of it,” returned
Miss Sophia heartily.
A few days later Liddie had an
other piece of news. “Miss Sallie
