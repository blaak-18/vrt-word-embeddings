NO. I, VOL.- V.
The Gazette has entered upon its
fifth year, this being No. I of Vol.
V. During the four years of its ex- t
istence. the paper has prospered. t
Its business has steadily increased t
since the day that it made its ap- C
pearance. Every day names are c
added to its subscription list, and it
is reasonable to say that before
long the paper will visit every home t
in the parish where the English lan- E
guage is read. As may be seen the 0
columns of the paper are filled with S
advertisements all of which are f
paid for in cash-we insert no
dead-heads. It is the policy of the h
paper to receive pay for its space. P
With a good list of paying sub- lI
scribers, an increasing advertising o
patronage and a fair job trade, The c
Gazette enters its fifth year with no ai
misgiving as to its future. "

and When the City Item circulated
-St. broadcast over the land the report
that Isaac Broussard, sheriff of
'ley Lafayette parish, was a defaulter,
ded the Clarion promptly pronounced
not the statement a lie. We felt that it
eep was but a thinly disguised scheme
of the Item to murder politically
this gallant and beloved Democratic
Ss leader, schemes that that paper has -
lost been known to resort to on several
is occasions. Therefore, we are glad
Sto to be able to give below the result
rtes of an investigation into the matter
by the Lafayette Grand Jury, which
Isas completely exonerates, if such was
leir needed, the beloved young sheriff
a of our sister parish:
led "We took special occasion to
ere make a minute investigation of the
ne- sheriff's accounts both with the par
by ish and State, and we are proud to
say to the people of the parish that
the scurrilous article that appeared
to in the Daily City Item some time
nd since, charging the sheriff with de
'he falcation of State funds, was and is
io, absolutely false and libelous.
ed Sheriff Broussard's accounts not
he only show that he is in good ac
he count with both State and parish,
In- but they also show that he has
t. settled with the auditor for amounts
due on deduction tax list and holds
the auditor's receipts therefor."
