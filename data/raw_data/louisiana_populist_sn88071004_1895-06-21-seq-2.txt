SECRETARY CARLISLE'S financial spee
ches are just like Johnl Sherman's. Both
are directly oppolsed to the sentimen*s
that gained for them the confidence of
the people. Amusing how these old
pairtY lealil'rs are lyinIg down in the
same ed. And the country is bleing
ruined by thle effects of their lalcrership.
-Coming Nation.
Time was when the lion. John G.
Carlisle might have been suspected of
Iheing the author of "Coin's Financfal
School." I'ut it appears that Mr. Car
lisle's miad has been all the time open
to conviction.-N. Y. Advertiser, Rep.
r4º~9---
The highest compliment paid the
leaders of the great silver move
ment in this staete by the goldlbngs,
is the charge that they are all men
without afollowing, i. e. not polit
ical bosses. This is true, these men
who have been pushed forward to
lead in this fight were until recently
part of the folmoers and come now
fresh from the masses. Only history
repeating itself however, as the
greatest heroes the world has ever
known were without a following
practically unknown, until--em
ergeucy called them forth from a
moug the masses.
Our neighbor, the Enterprise,
has this week, an advisory financial
letter from a country subscriber
who can't read. A month or so
ago it had a similar letter from one
of its readers who coukln't spell.
Strange that all the poor illiterates
should be gold-bugs, and find such
hearty welcome from the Enter
prise. Stranger still, that these
ignoramuses should so readily find
and adopt the right side of a ques
tion, which "Big I and Little U"
asuree us will require "the strict
est application of judgemIent, rea
mo and common sense, to settle..

people.
We have a ab"lidin faith in thie
int'egrity of a majority of the
loIlde in ewha ever pnlitical party
they may he found ; and 1 hie we
know that politicians have their
prie., and political partihe turn
untrsauui l on their platforms, the
masass of the pople with what
means of educatitn they have to
day at their command, will correct
the mistakes of their leaders and
iparties, and lpreserve the spirit of
lilberty and American institutions.
For years, party devotion and
party prejudice has hcld such per
feet sway in this country that no
reform, however vital to the indi
vidual or public welfare of our
citizens could load a man beyond
the narrow confines of his political
party, and no crime was too black
(not even perjury, bribery and
murder) to be comnnitted in sup
port of the party to which poor,
misguided, degradedn devotees to
party prejudice yielded slavish ser
vice.
But the light is breaking, an,'
men are realizing the awful condi
tion of society, political, moral
and social, which such narrow,
lrejudiced and slavish party devo
tion begets.
The People's party, since its or
ganization, the only party of re
f form in this State, has been com
pelled by the intolerant course of
the party in power to adopt the
same narrow policy. But time and
again has this party of reform of
fered to step out upon broad lines
and moeet the old parties square
upon principles, and been refused
until now.
In the congressional campaign
last Fall, the People's party offer
ed to put their ticket and their
platform against that of all other
parties in a white primary in which
all white voters regardless of par
ty should have equal rights, thus
making white supremacy absolute
ly certain, and wiping out the
miserable pretext for fraud and
perjury at elections.
The organized Democracy refus
ed this eminently fair and wise
proposition, but so many of the
rank and file saw and believed the
justice, and the wisdom of it, that
to-day the Bimetallic League which
will soon enroll in its membership
2-thirds of the voters of the Dem
ocratic party aceepts it and joins
hands with the Populists in recom
mending it to all parties.
On the 8th day of April last, a
committee of representative popu
lists assembled at Winnfield, La.,
from the parishes of Jackson, Cald
well, Winn and Grant, adopted
unanimously resolutions calling on
our Populist State Chairman,
Booth, to join with others in call
ing a nonpartisan oonvention "to
devise waegs and mm. by whieh
the tnallot-box tlheves and their
commanders can be overthrown,
sad the administration of govern
ment returned to the people where
it rightly belongs." Mr. Booth
complied with this resquest, and
the magaientt demomatration at
Washington Artillery Hall, on the
10th inst., was the result of the ef
forts of him ad smuch other popu
lists, demoerats mad republicans,
as love principle better tihan party.
This great convention did actually
what the populists demanded in
orgamaaed apmeatty on two ocec

another plank from the Poplat
pltform--ree silver-end on these

(Our young friend Mathis of the
People's Dem:ands, gets ofT the fol
lowing ncewsV item :
"Tilhe gohl-lul dailies do not
hesitate in saying that the free sil
ve'r convention in New Orleans was
W v would ix, glad to hear the
ab0ove ah lnlission of our strength
from the gold-hugs if it were true,
but we have been reading the daily
Picayune, and have failed to find
any such admnission .in it, and we
certainly think the Pie. is the or
gan of the monometallists.
For his information we give the
following clipping from the strong
est gold-bug sheet in North La.;
anti this is thoroughly in line with
all that we have been aidble to see
from gold-bug papers in regard to
said convention :
The silver convention in New
OHeans last Monday, was a con
glomerate nmaLs of the odds and
ends of all political parties. The
wild and untamed populist and the
corrupt ward politician of New
Orleans; the free silver democrat
and the out and out republican, all
sat side by side and cheered to the
echo the mouthings of the silver
winged grasshopper from Nebras
ka, and the soft Money Congress
man from Mississippi. A man's
denocracy must he "mitey" ravel
ly at the ends, to ally himself with
such a mongrel hybrid set.-More
house Clarion.
The Baton Rouge daily Advocate,
our State administration organ,
also chimes in against the silver
movement by calling its committee
a "Republican-Populist combine,"
and declares that,
"It is no longer free silver versus the
gold standard ; it is Democracy against
te field."
Thus the organ of the organized
Democracy in thi State declares
that the silver imovement is the
field against Dlntocracy, while
Bro. Mathis says it is a Democrat
ic move.
Again, Bro. Mathis says that
this move was gotten up to decoy
Populists off their platform, and
keep them from agitating ballot re
form.
If he will read the address sent
out by this movement and publish
ed elsewhere in this issue, he will
find that this movement is as much
a ballot reform move as a silver
move, and is the only organized
anti-administration (hence only sin
cere) ballot reform movement in
the State.
We believe Bro. Mathis honest
ly wants information on this move
ment, bccause of the two follow
mg paragraphs in his article:
"We are highly in favor of free silver,
and are willing to do all in our power
to secure the election of a free silver
State ticket, but we do not believe in
leaving the balance of our platform and
let alone ballot reform with the hope of
securing this one reform when we feel
that it is as impossible to do so as it
would be for us to stop the earth from
revolving around the sun, unless honest
elections can first be secured."
"We hope the Populist will throw all
the light on this subjec that it possibly
can, and while we honestly oppose its
position, we feel that its readers in this
pnrish, will not lose snything by read
Sboth sides of this question."
Now if he will read the address
already referred to, he will see that
every demand of his for ballot re
form and free silver is met, that
nobody asks him or any other pop
ulist to leave any of their platform,
that neither he nor any othdr popu
list is askCed to go into the Democrat
ic party, and that the whole address
sounds like a populist wrote it, and
we suspect it has no uncertain
sound.
The gold-bugs will do all in their
power in this campaign to keep the
silver movement divided so they
can be outvoted, and we shall be
arry to find populists without ply,
asisting them in a work for which
they, the gold-bags, are well paid.
The Coming Nation contains no
advertisemcnts, is a larger paper
than this one and is warranted to
make Populists out of every one
who has anything left in his cran
um to build to. That paper and
this one both one year, $1 (M) in
advance. tf.

Daily Times-Democrat.
The State Central Commnittee of
the Louisiana Biimetallic Lea-rue
got down to work yesterday, meet
ing in The Times-l)emocrat office
in response to the call of President
Phelps. The session was a long
one, devote"l principally to inci
dentals to the adoption of thi fol
lowing:
ADDRESS TO TIlE PEOPLE
OF LOUISIANA.
"Our republic is in the throes of
a great contest between the owners
of gold and the advocates of mon
ometallisnl on the one side, and the
l)loplle, the advocates of true bi
metallism, on the other.
"The future weal or woe of gen
erations vet unborn depends upon
the solution of this overshadowing
"Louisiana, as one of the sister
hood of States, is equally interest
ed in the solution of this mighty
question in the interest of the great
producing and IIercantile classe.,
in the interest of the lwrpetuity of
our democratic republic and free
institutions !
"The next State elect ion in which
the lpeople will speak through their
ballots upon this issue, April, 1 986,
must lb, held under existing elec
tion laws. An honest election is
necessary that they may express
their will so that it may be heard
by our sister States, and aid them
to have the will of the people ex
pressed in the law of the land.
The next State Legislature, then
to be elected, will be charoed with
the election of a Unit4e States
Senator, who will, for a long term
of years, represent our people.
"We must see to it that a man
who stands pledged to true bimet
alism, the free coinage of both
gold and silver upon equal terms,
at the ratio of 16 to 1, independ
ent of all other nations, is elected.
"The people of this great State
can hold an honest election only
when a majority of them organize
and determine to (do so. To so or
ganize, they only require to know
that if they do not do so their rights
will not be respected, their voice
will not be heard.
"This money .questi(.n, the de
mand for the full restoration of
silver, is the paramount issue not
only in Louisiana, but throughout
the United States, and it should be
settled, and settled in the interest
of the people against the money
changers, before any other ques
tion is permitted to confuse the
public mind or distract attention
from it.
"We, therefore, appwal to all
patriotic citizeons to unite with us
in organizing bimetallic leagues in
every ward in the State, whose
membership will pledge themselves
not to support for office any candi
date who does not stand unequivo
cally pledged to this course. This
isthepeople's cause, the cause of
liberty; it towers above party or
men, and demsands the sulpport of
every voter who loves liberty and
justice, hopes for prosperity, and
desires to promote eqi "ty of all
citisens in the right to the pursuits
of happiness. This is the cause of
labor, which produces all the
wealth of the land and paysthe
country's debts. In its last analy
sis, it is also the cause of the capi
talhst; His securities are thesym
bols of the activity of labor; the
concrete result of labor is exprees
ed in commodities produced; any
legislation, therefore, which steadi
ly depreciates the value of proper
ty destroys the substance and the
reality, and the securities, which
are but the symbols, must in the
inevitable logic of things perish
with the reahlity which they repre
sent.
"In behalf of this cause, we ap
peal to the people, that great court
of last resort, which finally rights
all wrongs, to unite into such or
ganizsation as will enable them to
gotothe polls in April, 1896, in
such force that no power of politi
cal combination can divert their
purpose or defeat their will.
"The intelligent masses should
rule the State and name the stand
ard-bearers for this cause. The
distracting questions of negro and
carpet-bag rule should be laid
aside. We demand unity of action
on the part of the white people of
the State in voting upon this great
issue. This can best be done, in
our opmon, by white primaries,
in which all white citizen voters
shall be permitted to participate
and express their views upon the
silver question and name the men
who shall be their standard-bear
ern : and we ask the phpple to unite
in a demand lupon all political or
