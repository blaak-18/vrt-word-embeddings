CLARA BARTON.
CENSURED BY ROOSEVELT AND
DEFENDED BY W. P. PHILIPS.
The Red Cross and Its Wonderful
Achievement-History of the Amer
ican Organization-A W\om
an's Mission and Work.
Bridgeport. Conn., March 16.--Wal
ter P. Phillips, for twenty years secre
tary of the Red Cross, has raised his
voice in protest against President
Roosevelt's recent action regarding the
society founded by Clara Barton, whom
he regards as a woman who has placed
* a new and striking imprint upon the
history of the human race. He regards
Miss Barton as one of those persons
who is every now and again born into
the world for some specific purpose, and
compares her greatness with that of
Alexander, Hannibal, Napoleon. Wel
lington, Susan B. Anthony, and a host
of others. Although he resigned his po
sition one year ago, he says he owes it
to himself to defend a woman who is
being unjustly assailed. In a lengthy
paper he has prepared Mr. Prillips tells
of the wonderful achievements of Clara
Barton.
Some twenty-five years ago when Mr.
Phillips .was at the head of the Asso
ciated Press in W\ashington a lady un
known to him at the time asked, through
a mutual friend, for an audience with
hiin. It was Miss Clara Barton.
"She came to my office and briefly
told me the story of the Red Cross from
its inception in Geneva down to that
time," says Mr. Phillips in his article.
"Even then' every important nation on
the face of the earth had given its as
sent and become a party to the Geneva
treaty, with the solitary exception of the
United States. The matter had been re
peatedly presented to our government,
but it had not appealed to Secretary
Seward, and his successors in the state
department were reluctant to recom
mend anything that had been consid
ered and rejected by that alert and able I
statesman. The latest attempt to secure
the adherence of the United States had
been made-by the Rev. Henry W. Bel
lows, who had finally given up the con
test against precedent and prejudice and I
had written to Miss Barton that while N
he wished her success in the field in r
which he had been defeated, he saw no I
hope in the situation for her or anybody t
else. e
"Miss Bartog, whose services in the q
Northern armies during the civil con
flice are matters of such recent history v
that I need not dwell upon them, had I
gone to Europe, in I869, for a much ti
needed rest. c
DECORATED BY EMPEROR I
DECORATED BY EMPEROR
WILLIAM.
>~With the breaking out of the wat.
between' Germany and France she was
urged to attach herself to the army of
the Grand'Duke of- Baden, and finally
complied. '-Her services- in that terrible
conflict were such that she was deco
rated-by the old Emperor William with
the Orde7 of the Iron Cross. No higher
mark of listinction can possibly be con
ferted by any ruler upon an individual.
"In this war Miss Barton gained a
direct and comprehensive knowledge of
the operations of the Red Cross. She
saw with her' own eyes what could be
accomplished by an organized force on
the battlefield, in the hospital and in the
camp. Her opportunities were -unrivaled
for* contrastin the methods of the Red
Cross Society with the imperfect work,
great as it was, accomplished .by the
Sanitary and Christian Commissions
during the somber days between the
time when the first hostile shot was fired
and Surnter quickly fell and the happy
day for both North and South when
General Lee surrendered his army at
Appomattox to General Grant. She re
turned to America in due course deter
mined to secure the adoption of the
Red Cross treaty by the United State
even if it cost her her heart's blood and
every dollar of the, comfortable fortune
she possessed. This was the situation
when she came to me and told me what
had been done by others and particu
larly by Dr. Bellows, and how every
endeavor, no matter how well directed,
or how assiduously sustained, had end
ed in absolute and unequivocal failure,
anad invited my co-operation.
GOVERNMENT ADOPTS RED
CROSS,
"Just before President Garfield was
hoet, in 188r, Mr. Blaine, then his secre
aty of stat, told Miss Barton, as the
tcove of anexhaustive discussions
etwena theua that the musty precedents
' *e tat* drptrtment did not neces
xrily lai hisiiay wauy and that he t
St yd C s treaty sufi
Congress. Thus the matter rested wher
President Garfield died and Genera
Arthur succeeded him. Mr. Blainc
quickly resigned and Mr. Frelinghuysen
1became the secretary of state. President
Arthur told Miss Barton that anything
she felt moderately sure his predecessor
would have done if spared, he would
do, and he kept his promise. In his first
message he devoted a paragraph to the
Geneva Treaty. urging its ratification by
the Senate. His action resulted in such
ratification by the Senate on March t.
1882.
MISS BARTON BEARS EXPENSE.
"Up to this time Miss Barton had
paid for clerk hire, stationery, printing.
postage, conveyance, rent, fuel and light
out of her own purse, and has contin
ued to do so from the time she appeared
in Washington on her Red Cross mis
sion in 1879, through all the speeding
years. Many subscriptions, and generous
ones, too. have been made to the Ameri
can Association of the Red Cross for
the purpose of relieving specific dis
tress, at Johnstown, in the flooding val
leys of the Mississippi, in Cuba during
the war with Spain, at Galveston, and
elsewhere, but that money has been
spent for relief purposes, pure and sim
ple. The expense of maintaining the or
ganization fro mthe beginning to the
pr.sent time has been paid almost whol
ly out of the private means of its presi
dent. The prevailing opinion is that the
Rer Cross is supported by the govern
ment and that it has no need of money
for the extension of its organization and
the expansion of its usefulness.
"The fact is that the Red Cross, the
world over, is supported by the people
and its office is to serve the government
in times of war by caring for those
who fall in battle or are overtaken by
disease on the field.
'But all of the contributions referred
to were spent for relief, and The very
life and continued existence of the Red
Cross, as an institution at once grand
and effective, have been dependent upon
the moderate income of one woman. No
man competent to fill her position, ever
inadequately, would undertake her du
ties on a salary of $ro,ooo per annum,
and I know of many whose duties are
Less onerous than hers have been who
are paid $25,000 per annum and up
wards.
..BFQINNING OF TROUBLE.
"It is unnecessary to say that at the
resent time all is not entire harmony
swithin the Red Cross organization. A
ecent letter written by Mr. Cortelyou
ias apprised the country of this. But
hat this letter was written under an ,
•ntire misapprehension of the facts is
luite apparent.
"ln the month of September, 190o0, 1
was in Washington and the Associates
Press reported on or about the ioth o0
that month that there was trouble ir
Galveston. I saw Miss Barton at Gler:
Echo and though she was suffering
from a cold she was preparing to stari
for Texas. On her arrival in Galveston
a report was immediately telegraphed
north that she was seriously ill, coupled
with an intimation that her career was
ended, which with characteristic prompt
ness and vigor she emphatically re
sisted, and the person who is thought to
have originated that report for ulterior
purposes lost no time in returning to
Washington, leaving Miss Barton to
her own devices. She remained person
ally in Galveston from early in Sep
tember until the middle of November
and her field agents until March.
FALSE REPORTS OF DECADENCE
"But in the face of the above it has
continued to be asserted that Miss Bar
ton is in her decadence, whereas the
truth is that she is stronger, abler, clear
er and more far-sighted, more enocomi
cal of her strength and better fitted to
make a fight against disease than any
woman twenty-five years her junior.
She has been ready and willing for more
than ten years to husband her constant
ly depleting income by surrendering the
Red Cross into competent hands, but no
one has yet appeared, excepting an oc
casional poseur, who would have any
thing to do with its management, while
every ambitious man and woman who
thought the presidency of the Red Cross
might help them socially, in Europe as
well as here, has v9nished as the mist
of the morning upon learning that the
presidency >f the Red Cross carries
with it a penalty in the shape of cash
which has to be provided for its main
tenance and extension. The only point
involved in the matter is that having
created the Red Cross in America by
her own money, Miss Barton naturally
reveres the product of her efforts and
objects to making a disposition of the
>rganization that might result in its dis
nemberment and eventual dissolution.
Whenever the proper person, man or
woman, or an aggregation of them in
be shape of a committee, come forward
with the ability to take up the work and
reserve -.the altnomy of what she has

she owes it to the people, to the gov
ernment, to the numberless Red Cross
societies in other lands and, more than
all, to herself, to conserve what she has
brought into being and to take no step
that does not contemplate the safety and
further development of her beneficent
undertaking. This has been her attitude
of mind since as early as 1893. and she
expressed herself clearly and with ab
solute truth when ,she spoke at the an
nual meeting of the members of the
Red Cross, held at the Arlington hotel
in Washington on July Io, 19oo.
PRESIDENT'S LETTER WOUNDS
HER.
"The letter that the President caused
Mr. Cortelyou to write to Miss Barton
has wounded her more than she could
have been hurt by the flying fragments
of a shell, and both she and her friends
are at a loss to understand how he could
have. been led to do this when even a
cursory glance at the broad subject
would have convinced him that the mat
ter admitted of no controversy whatso
ever. To those familiar with Red Cross
history it is most obvious that as surely
as somebody blundered when into the
Valley of Death rode the six hundred,
just so surely was someone laboring
under a gross misconception of Red
Cross affairs when the President was
informed concerning them, and believ
ing in his courage and high sense of
honor, the friends of the Red Cross and
of Miss Barton fell assured that he will
amend his action as soon as the read
issues in the case are brought to his
notice.
"Referring to the memorial to Con
gress on the contents of which Presi
t dent Roosevelt based his refusal to serve
1 on the board of consultation of the Red
S Cross or to allow the members of his
cabinet to serve, it will be seen that he
was misinformed as to what was done
I and the manner in which it was done at
the Red Cross annual meeting on De
cember 9, 1902. It is greatly to be re
gretted that such action should have
been taken by the President without
giving a hearing to the majority of the
organization, or to Miss Barton herself.
There is nothing new or strange in the
fact that there should be differences of
opinion as to the management of such
an organization-very few escape inter
nal conflicts; but it is generally under
stood that the majority of the members
are entitled to control or at least to
consideration. It is especially significant
that the minority should have been
heard without notice to the majority,
and that it should have proceeded imn
mediately to put the correspondence,
without even waiting for the formal re
ply from Miss Barton, in the form of a
niemorial to Congress to be printed as
an executive document, and thereby
made subject to wide-spread distribu
tion, under the official frank and appar
ent authority of Congress. and that its
distribution should have been so widely
made. both in the United States and
abroad, reflecting, most unjustly, upon
the fair name of the organization and
its president.
BRANDS MEMORIAL AS FALSE.
"Were the statements made in that
letter wholly true, or did they include
all of the facts bearing upon it, which
are necessary to a fair judgment of the
subject, it would have been, in a meas
ure, excusable.
"Regarding the claim that changes
were made, in severa linstances, by a
sort of trap laid by Francis At'water,
there is absolutely nothing in that.
There was nothing irregular in the re
quest made by him for proxies. He was
entirely within his rights. Not one-half
of the proxies were returned to his
haids o rsubject to his discretion, but
the signers sent them to several of the
persons who were present, to use in ac
cordance with their judgment. While
there were seven states represented by
members actually present, the entire list
of,signrs to the memorial, with one ex- 1
ception, are residents of Washington,
D. C. In every act of record, including t
all to which exceptions are taken, there I
was' a clear majority of those actually I
rc:ent recorded in the 'affirma~ive. Thee
ion, s one year, as made by Hion. John
.\'. Foster. was only voted upon by
those present. without the use of prox
ies, and was defeated by a vote of sev
enteen to sixteen. There were some
prsent who realized that delay was
equivalent to the death of the organiza
tion, and voted accordingly. The by-laws
were not adopted as stated in the me
morial by a vote of 89 to 13, of which 72
were proxies. A clear majority of those
present voted affirmatively by roll call.
"it is true that the by-laws as adopted
were not submitted to the members of
the executive committee, nor was there
any necessity that they should be prior
to the meeting. At the time of sending
out proxies and the request made for
their signing but slight changes had
been suggested, and Hon. Richard Ol
ney, counsellor of the Red Cross, had
been advised of those. Other and more
radical changes were suggested after
ward. They were not considered by a
self-constituted committee, but by per
haps a dozen different members, who
had the right to consider them. No one
o4 twi is responsible for the changes,
but it was generally determined that
they should be presented for adoption
as they were finally read in the meeting.
"In providing that the officers shall be
elected annually, except the president,
who may be elected for life, it was clear
ly the thought to recognize Miss Barton,
as all the world has recognized her, as
peculiarly the embodiment of the Red
Cross idea and principles, and whose
life work fairly entitles her to such re
cognition.
ENEMIES PERSISTENT AGI
TATORS.
"As already noted, the signers of the
memorial to Congress are, with one ex
ception, citizens of th District of Col
umbia, and most of them are new mem
bers, the most persistent agitator-Miss
Mabel T. Boardman-having been swept
into membership on the flood tide that
brought us the new act of incorporation
of g19oo. Among the suggestions made
by Miss Boardman, in a letter written
to Mrs. John A. Logan, vice president
of the Red Cross, is one providing that
1 iss Barton be relegated to the rear
made honorary president-and an an
nuity arranged for her by Miss Board
man's father and others, amounting to
$2,5oo per annum. If anything were
needed to show that Miss Boardman is
a very new element in the Red Cross,
her proposition to pension Miss Barton
would be quite sufficient. For a quarter
of a century Miss Barton has been giv
ing both time and money to the cause of
the Red Cross. She has yet other things
that she intends to give it, but she has
no designs on a pension. I have spoken
of her depleting income, but not of her
impaired fortune. She is a woman of
ample means.
"Had Miss Barton's work been done
from headquarters in New York, Chi
cago, Boston or any American city
other than Washington, it is doubtful
if a clique of people who were new in
the organi7ation, and none of whom ever
visited a single field where Red Cross
work was under way, for the purpose
oi participating in it, would have dared
to raise their voices against her. Wash
ington is surely peculiar in respect of
producing a certain class of people
whose sense of fairness and propriety
constitutes a striking case of arrested
development.
NAME SPOKEN WITH REVER
ENCE.
In conclusion Mr. Phillips says it has
sometimes seemed to him that the "sun
ny philosopher, quoted below, must have
had Washington, the Red Cross and
Miss Barton in view when she said: 'It
