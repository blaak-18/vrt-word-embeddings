RESOLUTIONS BY SCREVEN CO.
FARMERS’ UNION.
Whereas, Brother S. J. Cowan has
been in our county, at our solicita
tion, doing work among our Local
Unions; and
Whereas, we feel that his work
among us has been of such a charac
ter as should call for some expression
of appreciation from us; therefore,
be it
Resolved by the Screven County
Farmers’ Educational and Co-opera
tive Union, First, that we wish to
thank Bro. Cowan for his faithful and
efficient service in our county.
Second. That we desire to com
mend him to the Brotherhood every
where as a loyal Union man; one
whom we believe has the love of the
order at heart, and who is splendidly
fitted and equipped for the work he
has been doing.
Third. That a copy of the resolu
tions be sent to the Sylvania Tele
phone, Swainsboro Pine Forest,
Farmers’ Union News, and the week
ly Jeffersonian, with a request that
they publish same.

BOSTON JOHN IS BUSY.
Dear Sir: —Well, it seems as if
Boston’s John closed down explana
tion is fooling a few. One man told
that from John’s explanation it was
outsiders doing all this devilment,
and from the way he talked they
claim they just don’t have money to
carry out their plans. Just have to
do the best they can, and so on. Now
if they will quit spending so nr
money on sending out people tr , k
for the Union News, imp. ‘lent
plant, guano plant, powder plant,
well ,all this valuable information,
they would not need so much money.
Just lay it on them —they are a
goner. A FRIEND.
BRO. JOHNSON IS SHOWN.
Dear Sir:—Bro. J. J. Johnson
wants to know what it is we want
put right at the State and national
convention. He says I should have
named some things. Now, if Bro.
Johnson has been reading The Jeffer
sonian and don’t know what that is,
I think he is too ignorant to pray for.
He ought to know, also, that I am
not the only one that made that re
quest in The Jeffersonian.
Bro. Johnson, there have been
grave charges made against some of
our leading men in the Union, and
published in The Jeffersonian, and
and they have not dared to come out
publicly, like they were accused, and
make any denial or explanation in
any way. Bro. Johnson, how does it
suit you to have a bank-wrecking
lawyer for counsel for the Farmers’
Union? Brother, I think you had
better post up some yourself before
you go to jumping on some one else.
Just such men as you are would let
some Smart Alex smash the Farm
ers’ Union like Lon Livingston did
the Farmers’ Alliance. You invite
me back into the fold; you must have
had one of John Lee’s circular let
ters. lam still a member of Liberty
Hill Local No. 1019, and none of my
Local brethren have taken any ex
ceptions to anything I have done or
said. Now, Bro. Johnson, I think if
you will get the mote out of your
own eye and sweep around your own
door before you jump on your neigh
bor, it would be more becoming in
you. The day I got the paper with
your article in it I received word
that my brother was dying, and I
have not had the chance to pay you
any attention until now.

A CHALLENGE TO JOHN LEE.
Dear Sir:—l noticed some time
back of some criticising John Lee’s
method of raising the dust and your
comment on same, and I want to say
that is not the worst feature of it. I
have been waiting for some one to
ring John Lee up in court and find
him guilty. I will challenge John
Lee, or any other Union City official,
to prove that the raise in dues are
being distributed as we voted them
to be. John Lee told us to let out
siders alone and get our proof on the
inside and bring it up, and he would
give us satisfaction. We have writ
ten him, and he will dodge, and when
we write him again he will treat us
with contempt and not answer us at
all.
I have the amendment that the
Farmers’ Union of Georgia voted on
to raise the dues telling just how
they would be distributed, and any
Union brother can get a copy by
writing me at Cuthbert, Ga., enclos
ing stamp for reply. Lee assured us
that if we voted the raise in dues
that the State officials would use
their part in sending capable men
over Georgia to educate the farmers,
and now he is calling for money out
of our Local and county treasuries,
and if we don’t furnish it we get no
benefits at all, notwithstanding the
State gets 20 cents instead of 12
cents, and, gentlemen, here is the
point: Lee will call enough State
meetings to keep our treasury drain
ed and the people, after raising dues
for a certain purpose, are not going
down in their T ':ekets for any more
as the U"’’ - ’City bosses will give us
noUiStriqh return, and we will- never
ts hoV where the raise in dues went to.
About all the lecturers we ever get
are men sent around begging stock for
the Commercial Implement Co,, and
a few other things, and sometimes
their expenses are greater than the
stock subscribed. Brethren, what is
there in the Union for a poor man the
way it is drifting? If a Local of
poor men want to buy some farm
tools through the Union, they can’t
buy unless they own stock in the
commercial factory, or else pay the
retail price at Union City, and the
freight added, which makes it cheap
er to go to his home merchant to
buy, and still these poor peoples’
dues are going to help pay the State
business agent good wages to assist
them in buying, and they will abuse
us if we don’t patronize what the
Union City bosses call our own insti
tution.
If John Lee had the good of the
Union at heart he would resign, but
it seems he is bent on tearing it up.
Yours truly,
Cuthbert, Ga. UNION MAN.
HOW THE REGISTRATION LAW
WAS EVADED.
Dear Sir:—When I was in a
business house in town a few days
ago I saw an old gentleman write
a man’s name on a slip of pa
per and say, “Go see if this man is
registered, if not, have him register.”
His son said, “Yes, if I find him not
registered I will have him regis
tered.” Now, this was the seventh
of April when I saw this work. Os
course, I knew what such will do for
Is what we
save you on 'Y W®

Jeffersonian
us reformers, but did not think to
set down the man’s name. In fact, I
just passed it by till I read Mr. Gib
son’s letter to you. Now I can see
what this registration closing so soon
means. Now these wire-workers
will get busy and slip on everybody
they can control, where they can do
so. A VOTER.
“ Remember the Alamo”—
The siege of the Alamo was one of
the most picturesque struggles for
liberty that has taken place on the
American continent. Unwilling to be
dominated by the Mexicans, the Tex
ans valiantly resisted and finally suc
ceeded in throwing off the yoke, and
gained their independence and held it
for nine years, under five different
presidents, until annexed to the Uni
ted States.
The two most important actions in
the Texas revolution were the siege of
the Alamo and the battle of San Ja
cinto. One hundred and forty-four
Texans taking refuge in the Alamo
in San Antonio, an old Spanish build
ing combining a church and a fort,
were besieged by a force of 4,000
Mexicans. The siege of the Alamo
began on February 23, 1836. It
lasted eleven days, when it was taken
by storm and every Texan killed. In
the State House of Austin, the capi
tal city of Texas, on a monument
made of stones of the ruins of th£
mission fort, are inscribed the narru/s
of the men whose death gave the
Anglo-American race eternal reason
to “Remember the Alamo.”
It was the battle of San Jacinto
which finally settled the conflict in
favor of the Texans, and never was
seen a more brave dash for liberty
than the little Texan band put up in
this fight, rallying the columns with
the cry, “Remember the Alamo.”
On February 22 Santa Ana, with
his Mexican army, had arrived at
San Antonio. On the morning of the
23d, he called upon Col. Travis to
surrender, but was answered by a
cannon shot. The Mexican general
at once hoisted the red flag as a sig
nal that no quarter would be given.
The Alamo had been prepared to re
sist any attack except from artillery.
The second in command was no other
than James Bowie, the inventor of
the long-bladed “bowie-knife,” used
by the hunters and desperadoes of
the plains. Davy Crockett was an
other of the heroes of the Alamo.
The final attack was made on
March 6 —Sunday. Travis, who was
struck on the head, had fallen beside
his gun at the northwest corner.
Bowie was precipitated from a scaf
folding by the walls, and was unable
to move from the bed where he had
been laid in an upper room of the
convent barracks. He was still able,
however, to die as he had lived, firing
the pistols which had been placed by
his side before he was finally run
through with a bayonet.
The church was the last to be
taken. Its defenders, too, fell back
inch by inch, fighting till each man
was slain. Davy Crockett was among
the last to fall. In less than an hour
all was over. Thus perished, to the
last man, the defenders of the Alamo.
There were left to tell the tale only
two widowed American women, with

their two children; a Mexican wom
an, who was torn from Bowie’s side
by his murderers, and a colored slave
boy of the dead general. The Texans
wanted to give them decent burial,
but Santa Ana refused, and the dead
heroes were heaped together in lay
ers with wood and dry brush be
tween. One hundred and eighty-two
bodies were counted before the torch
was applied. A year later the bones
were buried in one coffin near the
Alamo, which was left standing as a
memorial of Texan independence, and
as an exhibition of the most pic
turesque fight for liberty on this con
tinent.—Washington Star.
After
La Grippe
“I had suffered several weeks
with LaGrippe. Had pains in
my head and eyes. It felt as
though there was a heavy weight
on the top of my head, until it
seemed that my brain would
burst. I was so nervous that
I could not rest or sleep. When
I dozed off I would awake with
a sudden jerking of my whole
body. Dr. Miles’ Nervine, Heart
Remedy and Nerve and Liver
Pills cured me. A number of
friends have since realized the
same benefits.”
MRS. ALVIN H. LOCKS,
Seabrook, N. H.
The after effects of LaGrippe
are often more serious than the
disease, as it leaves the system
in a weakened condition that
invites more serious troubles,
such as pneumonia, etc.
Dr. Miles’
Restorative Nervine
should be taken for some time
to thoroughly restore nerve
strength.

gists. If the first bottle does not benefit,
your druggist will return your money.
