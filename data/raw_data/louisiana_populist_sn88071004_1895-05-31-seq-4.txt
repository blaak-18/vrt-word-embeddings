the foundation of Whittier's poem.

"1 Lbeg you. nmy retty girl, to turn

(;reat lauvhter fl;uwcd this remark.
)n leaving the  itne-s box, at the
end of her ex amination, she was fol
lowed by murmuirs of admiration. In
an account of the trial given by a
lea ling local newspan!r, it was stated
that silO was a great success, and

'Ihe juidge doubtless forgot his law

SUSAN AND THE MULE.

',[ think I can if I know whenr

certain as to what lie exp.t, 1l of iii". 1
''Well, I'm in this sort of a fix." h,
proceeded, very confidentially, aft, r
giving a hitch to the box heI wa,
sitting on. ,,I've been goin' to s
old man Mullins' gal Susan. an' she,
tuck to me like a wet kitten to a hot
brick. but she kinder hankers after
money."
'"Most women do," I venturte.
"1 reckon you're more'n half right.

The i'loposition seemi.d fair enough., t(
for the young man was lonest anil
very earnmt, so I lild the mule andi]
he went away on foot, holding the $7. P
While he was gone I got to thinking,
and when he came back I lay for hiin.
Dl)id you get her?' I asked, as I re
turned the $7 to my pocket.
"'In courso I did," he replied tri- tl
umphantly, 'feor Susan's a gal uv her "'
word."
* lBy the way," I asked, as he
mounted the mule. "'why did yo'l
come to imn for the money. The mule
is worth a good deal more than $7. o
Why didn't you call the young lady's u
attention to that?"
11e winked slyly as he dug his heels I
into the mule's ribs.
" 'Caze. colonel," he laughed aloud, P
''Susan knew hit warn't my mule." t,
Then, as lie rode merrily towa'd l
Susan's, 1 pondered profoundly on
what a queer little cuss Cupid is.
THE KENSINGTON RIPPER. l
Two Women Encountered lHer and il
Escaped 111th Sligmht Injury. '
A lady who shared the late Kensing
ton panic was going home one after
noon, writes James Payn in the Illus
trated London News, when in a lone- t
ly part of her road a woman rcslpect- "
ably dressed asked her the way to the
very square in which she lived.
Thinking this a certain prelude to the
usual stab with a knife, the lady, a
with great presence of mind, hit her e
interrogator two violent blows in the ,
face with the handle of her umbrella,
I which put her to flight, and ran horme
at the top of her speed. It was an
adventure of which she thought she a
had sonicme reason to be proud, though
it rather upset her. She had adver- !
tised for a cook, and at 5 o'clock
she was expecting a person to call
upon her for the situation. She did =
not arrive, however, till nearly six,
and then not in a very presentable •
condition. A bandage was on her
forehead and some stickini-plaster
over her nose. "I am sorry," she,
said, ,"to Ulb into, ma'am, but I have
had a frightful adventure. I asked
my way to your house of a person :
who almost looked like a lady, and
she up with her umbrella and knocked
me about most dreadful: however, I
am glad to have escaped, for I have
no doubt it was the Kensington Rip
per."
Cow-Ltke Eyes.
The necessity of exercising care in
the choice of epithets for use in
making comlplimentary speechcs came t
home with pecuiiar force to a German- D
town young man a few days ago. Heo
had been calling for some time upon a!
very charming, young lady,whose most
prominent features were her liquid
brown eyes. Theo beauty of these
eyes particularly impressed itselt a
upon the susceptible (;ermantown I
youth. One day he met the young
lady's most particular friend, and the
conversation naturally turned upon
the absent fair one. The young man,
wishing to say something nice about
her, remarked upon the *'cow-like
exprcssion of her eyes." Of course,
the particular friend told the young
lady what the youth had said, and
the young lady not knowing that tho e
cow has the most beautiful eyes of
any animal, human or brute, became
very indignant, and now she doesn't
speak to the young Germantown
youth. lie, on his part, is inclined to
believe that the young girl's riend
told the other that he had said ,,she
looked like a cow."
HIa the Most 1+gu.
The little creature which bears the
distinction of owning more legs (and
feet) than any other known organized
being is the millipede, which literally
means ",thousand-footed." There are
several species of these curious
worms, all possessing the character
istic of having a many-egmentod
body, each segment provided with a
pair of legs. Unlike the centipedes
,,hundred-footed"-they are perfectly
harmless.
