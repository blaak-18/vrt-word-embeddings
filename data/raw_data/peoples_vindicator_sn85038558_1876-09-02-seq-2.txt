Fair Election.
It. is scarcely necessary for us to
reiterate the fact, that all we ask is
[i FAIE RECIAsTRATION, J FAIR ELEC
TION, anti a FAIR COUNT, and it may
inot be superfllaous to add, that we are
determined to Aare then: at all hazards.
The registration and election ma
chinery of the State is in the hands
of the Radical party, and they will
be held responsible for the fair and
honest conduct of both.
The Registrars have all been ap
pointed, and they must notify the
citizens flly and .'reely of their in
tention to register them according to
the intent of the law-giving themn
due notice of the time and places of
visits throungluat the Walds of the
parishes. Col. Patton, Chairman of
the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, has asked Gov. Antoine to ap
point one Democratie Ctk to each
Registrar thronghont the State;
should Antoine grant this request, it
will show, at least, some desire on
the part of the Radicals to have a
fair registration. Should tie refuse to
do so, we will know that this cry of
fairness on the part of tire Radicals is
all cant, and we may expect and be
repared for all manner of rascality.
e have this to say, and we know
that it is not violence, that so ofickdal
can serre in faturec, who is not fairly
electetd.
We have pledged ourselves that
violence and intimidation shall not
be indulged in-that it never has
been indulged in on our part, we take
Rfoars and FrT'as Republican reports,
for strong, out-spoken evidence. We
are determined to protect such color
ed men who desire to vote our ticket
from any and every species of intimi
dation; we want and will have a fair
election, and this mnst be fully un
derstood in advance.
We have tamely submitted to the
utrageous acts of two Returning
Boards. Another, will be one too
many.
We have seen polling places estab
lished in negro districts alone, and in
white districts alone; that shall be
stopped, and we nill insist that the
polling places shall be placed as they
were in 1874, when we had full power
to place them, in public, open and pub
lished preeinetse in every ward is thiA
parish.
It is the sheerest folly to suppose
that we do not know, in the country,
our situgtion. We know that vio
lence will lead to Federal interfer
ance, by. which we will lose the
fruite of victory-,-that such things
will only add to the Radical cry of
the "bloody shirt," and afford a pre
text to b~ildooze us with U. S. Mar
shals and troops, and for the use of
the infamous Returning Board. And,
on the other hand, the Radical tlhieves
of this parish and State, must learn,
and we tell them so now, that they
are expected to coaudnet this election
fairly and honestly. . Their acts most
be above suspision. No person enti.
tied to registration, or to a vote, must
be deprived of that right. Polling
places must be established to suit thie
convenience of all classes of voters-i
public notice mast be given of these
places, Clerks and Commissioners of
election must be appointed iu accord
ance with the meauing and intent of
the law. This much, on time part of
those who control the machinery of
the law, we will insist upon; andu
from the party organlzaiionu of the
Radical party, we demand and,will
enforce a strict observance of the
rightts of iudividuals under..tie Con
stitution of thea United States, and
tihe laws of this State.
Every mani shall be allowed to vbte
asl he seesfit, witlout fear of outrage.
No asch thing will be tolerated as
that of.drowning the mule of a poor
Ilboring Lrgi'o man, because be voted
t ieldrocrrila ticket, as ras done in
1874, by hso Iadicals in thie ward.
Ni. oinehltallh whipped or shlot, as
,ihsl~r n done in the 1lth aind 12tf
wirds in ilimes past by Radical buim
mere and shoulder bisters, but every
manadltUll stand fairly upon file law
iera citizen,andt vote Iand act as one,
wit)rtte fear of epeneqences.
This much the. Radical gang here
.id ~lmewhere must uaderstand. If
they do this, and fairly elect their
ticket, no one willidmure but ehould
it he otherwise, then no Radical of
icll can serve in any of the country
parIehes. .

To the Colored People.
We think it our duty to set our
t colored fellow-citizens tight on some
- questions which are being contiual
ly harped upon by Radical of  seek
i ers in thteir speeches in elilbs and
elsewhere throughout this patish.
We are charged with desiring to
g deprive the colored people of their
I rights under the law. We pronounce
I such a statement, nºo matter front
lhat anthrity it may emanate, as
- false in every particulnr. (In the con
l trary, it is onr determination, and it
- is also to our interest, to protect and
º defend the colored citizen in all the
t rights which we enjoy, but no more.
f It is our determination to do so, for
e the reason, that whatever may have
f been our views and feeling on the
question of slavery at one time, we
can now only look upon it with feel
ii ings akin to horror. It was not our
fault we found it here, we used it as
t we found it, but since it has been
º abolished, we are more than satisfied
t that free labor is to the interest of
) this country, and we would never ex
f change it for slave labor-therefore
a we would never agree to return yon
i to slavery if we succeeded in getting
control of this Government, and we
v have only to point as a satisfacition of
1 this argument to the States of Vir
y ginia, North Carolina, (deorgia, Ala
barma, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas,
t Missouri and Kentucky, all Southern
t States, and filled withl negroes, where
t the Democratic party has had full
control for the past years, and where
the negro enjoys more liberty, is more
s prosperous and happy, has himself
- and children better jprotected and
t educated than here in Lonuismna, or
in South Carolina, the only two Re
r publican States South.
Those two States are, in fact, the
worst governed-the taxes are higher,
there is less protection of liberty
and property than any Democratic
º State of the whole South, and we de.
fy a refutation of this statement.
And on the charge of returning you
º to slavery if we get cotrol of the
i Government, we have only to ask,
"how.many 'ree men of color lived
here as free men 4.efore the war, who
r were never molested or sold into
slavery, who owned property, and
r came and went as they chose t" at
least a thousand; and if we did not
do it then when we had full control
of not only this State, but the entire
Government, and it would have paid,
is it reasonable to suppose we will do
it now when we do not control that
s Government, and when it is against
four interest to do so. What we want
in getting control of the Government,
and we are going to get Control of it
F this year certain, is Mis : We want
Sfirst, that honest men, competent men,
and men born and bred among us,
should control and direct affairs, so
that the State and parislh governments
should be conducted economically
andjustly. We want to reduce the
number of oflicers in this State just
one-half, and their salaries also one
half. We desire that the money col
leeted in taxes slall be legitimately
-expended. That the children of all
Scolors shall be ednucated, not that the
I money shall be stolen as it was done
by lMyers, whom yon elected Judge,
r and who waus appointed Treasurer .of
F your School Board by Blunt, who,
Ito.day, supports him in his defence
Iof this charge of theft. We know,
and yoa must know that good citizen
I ship comes with and from an eduea
ted people, from those who can read
.and write, anod to secnure that citizen
) ship we are as anxious that your chil
dren should be educated as that oars
should be, and we are willing to jax
o4rselves for that purpose for all
tfime. We do not desire to mourder or
maltreat any colored man; have pev
er done so, but will,'on the contrary,
protect them fromnt violenee andfraud,
no matter from what 8soarce itmay

In reference to the meeting held at
Camupte, on Monday, August 14, 1876,
the Vindicator publishes the follow
ihg:
"Blunt declared in his speech at
Cumpte, that if he should Ih killed,
and he was emphatic that he would
not be, buti he could not forego the
opportunity to threaten
TIHE TOW1t OF NATCHITOCHIES WOULD
BE BURNED TO TIlE GROUND
the day it was done."
It is only naleessary for the under
signed, who were present and heard
Senator lBlunt's speech, to state that
the language imputed to him was
never nttered. Neither the Editor of
the Vindicator, nor the informant, Mr.
Perot, were present at the meeting,
and whoever reported such sentiments
as being proclaimed by Senator Blunt,
made a misstatement, to call it by no
inmoure ohjectionable term.

that Blunt had not eed e the expres

A DANGERIOUS CONSPIRIACY.
P That the Republicans have meant
11 to do do ischief in the coming cam
paign, few had the hardihood to
doubt. But no one has dreamed that
e they would attempt the infanmona
e scheme that is exposed in another
part of the Times this morning. For
some weeks it has been observed that
a large force of clerss were doing
a some mysterious work in one of the
e upper rooms of the State House. That
e force, it is now discovered, consists of
detailed policemen selected for their
intelligence, who are occupied in at.
tering the registration books of 1874,
so as to cover with the mask of law
the fraudulent votes intended to tb
r cast by the Radicals for the purpose
of carrying the next election. The
1 plan is to import negroes from Ala
a bama-which having given over 40,
- 000 maJority for Houston is regarded
as irretrievably lost to the Republi
cans--and rote them in New Orleans
and the parishes where the Demo
r ertie-Conservative force is strong.
k To prevent the- detection of these
a fraudulent votes the registration books
9 are altered by changing alternate
leaves. In transetibnog the register
a to the sebstruted leaves every third
f line is shipped, that it may be filled
up at the proper time with the name
of an imported voter.
A conspiracy so dangerous calls for
instant action to frustrate it. The
registration books are in the keeping
of the State Registrar ofVoters. Gov.
Hlahn has the reputation of being an
honest man and a fair one,, and has,
it is presumable, been kept in, ignor
ance of the fact that those books are
t being tampered with. Let him at
once take possession of the books and
throw them open to the examination
of a committee of prominent Demo
crats and Conservatives. Then let
immediate steps be taken to ferret out
rand properly punisih the perpetrators
I of this heinous outrage. Mr. S. B.
Packard, you have had the -epntation
f of-honesty and iutegrity in your per.
sonal dealings with men, and public
Saffuairs. We are loth to believe that
you have any knowledge of this mat
ter. In the interest of honesty and
justice, will yon look to it that this
attempt to swindle thie Conservative
voters of this 8tate lie checked, and
at once ?-N . 0. Tme.

Don't fail to Register if you have
Snot done so in 1874.
Thie Riadical campaign, according
r to thie New Orleans Democrat, will be
Sconfined to thie doubtful parishes. Os
these, the Radical party will conceo
I trate all their money, promises and
Sofices; all the rascally scheomes their
Singenious brains can conceive. The
Sdoubtful parishes are, St. Tamnmany,
SSt. Helena, Morehouse, East and
r West Feliciana, Washington, DeSoto,
SBossier, Caddo, Assumption Avoyelles
) East Baton Rouge, Caldwell Catsa
houla, Franklin, Grant, IbehiUe Jas

Iles, Rapides, Richland, St. Martio,
Terboone and Webster, 20 parishes
that send 44 members to the Legisla
tare.
If they finad those too big a job they
will give up such as Lincoln, Cald
well, Washington, Batou Rouge and
Rapides, and conoeBtrate on the re
matinder.
Tihe Democrat says:
The coming election will hnardly be
a close one, yet few people kntow how,
terrible close every election is. Tihe
Mobile Register hoLrrifed. the people
of Alabamam on the eve of the lhrst
election by ghowing that a change of
tweety-thbe v~es.eI the whole Stse
from tmhe eleetion of 1874, when the
Democrats had over 12,000 majority,
might lose them the Legislature,
House and Senate. It is not quite so
bad here. Yet the ehange of 261
votes in Certain parishes from the
vote of 1871 (correct count) would
clmange sixteen Radicals-a loss of
thirty-two mnember* of the Legisla
ture. On the other band, a lchange
of 81 votes in our faevor would give
as eleven Leasts formerly held by Rad
icals. These 844 vtes therefore corm
msand twenty-sevesseats, more tlman
*ee.lfth of the Legislature, and out.
balance the vrtes '. 80,000 citiseis in

parish and it was condneted' n our
t part with fairness and impartiality-
r In fact it was the only fiir election
held here since the reconstruetion
of this parish.
There were thirteen polling pre
cincts, one in each ward, with an ex
tra one in the 12th, in the parisi'
In D)enrocratic wards the Rflpubll
cans were allowed a majority of elerks
and commissioners of election.
In Republican wards the Demoa
erats were allowed majorities.
The registration was conducted
fairly and openly; every ward was
slowed full time to register its eit.
izens, and notices of the visits of the
registrar were prsted in each ward in
full time to inform the citizen.
The votes were collnted at each
precinct in presence of every one and
the remsot declared ; and this parish
went 26 radical majority, notwith"
standing the free use of troops and
United States marshals. We make
these statements simply to point a

the Radicals, wh lhave now fall con

If this is done and radilals are

it is mere time lost in conducting an
election otherwise. No citizen will

Peace and the observance of law
fu this purishr can only be attained by
allowing the citizens a fair and free
opportunity to give expression to

Fraud.
We take it for granted, and. tmhe
very initiatory aet of the radicalsgo to
prove the fact that FRanUD will be
.perpetrated upon u in the coming
election and dum lug this registration.
Ilonesty and fairness are not coml
ponent parts nft Republicanism in any
part of tie Union and particularly so
in Louisiana. Some deep laid vil
lainy is conlteued in this parish
in order to rev1rse tillien fortrunes
and droopmng spitits of the radicals.
That tiis is so, the appointmnent of
an alien registrar sualciently mndi
etes, and when tire fact is stated that
this same registrar came here in 1872
and was engaged in manufacturing
the fraudnlent aflidavits by which
Kellogglays elaima to his position, the
evidence is almost conclusinve, that
fraud and rascality is thie pnrpose
and intent of these fellows,
Tihe rascality Li deep laid, from
the fact that no local radical would
accept the edtice of registrar, and an
officee that would not tempt a Natchi
toches radical Ims but few charms for
the cupidity of the average thief, fromt
fearof the rsponsibilkty, persoali
