WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 27.—What is the political situation
in Washington today?
That’s a question that is frequently asked and discussed from
week to week because of the presence and activities here of the
men of prominence in the nation and here is their workshop, as it
were. This is the place where they come together from day to
day in the senate, in the house, in the cabinet circle, in the senate
and house office buildings and in the various departmental head
quarters of the government where cabinet men sit at the head.
And Washington hears from all
parts of the country constantly. Pub
lic men keep in touch frequently
with their constituents, the people
back home, and thus the sentiment
throughout the country is manifest
ed in Washington through our pub
lic men. It is a direct reflection of
what the people of the country are
thinking and saying. Furthermore.
Washington is getting to be a great
mecca for political visitors as well
as sight seers; they come here from
•very nook and corner to confer
with their public men, their repre
sentatives in congress here.
Oil Leaves a Smell
The oil sensations and disclosures
are still with us and oil, as most peo
ple know, is sticky and slippery as
well as smelling badly. However, the
ship of state seems to be going along
and the sailing is made a little eas
ier as the political housecleaning
takes place from time to time The
public can cheer up somewhat in
knowing that “Fall fell not in vain’’
if it is the means of cleaning things,
•f remedying such situations and
purifying our public life, for no one.
aot even Republicans are attempt
ing to make much of a defense for
his acts. Americans do not like what
he did and there are not many who
are going to defend him. Of course,
both parties are playing the politi
cal game for all it is worth nowa
days preceding the approaching na
tional campaign.
Talked Prohibition
The nearest this oil trouble came
to touching the White House was in
the calling of C. Bascom Slemp, the
president’s private secretary, as a
witness before the Public Lands com
mittee for interrogation as to what
took him to Palm Beach, Florida, at
the time Messrs Fall and McLean
were sojourning there. It was as
certained that the three men were
together considerable, but Slemp
told the committee that most of the
conversation between the three was
of prohibition and not oil.
lie committee, however, did not
get anything that in the least af
fected the standing of the president,
•o every one agreed. It seems that
•o far President Coolidge is stilk un
contaminated by the oil deals.
Lawyers Are Busy
The two attorneys for the govern
ment in the prosecution of those who
are guilty in the oil scandals are
mighty busy. Former Senator Pom
erene, of Ohio, and Mr. Roberts, of
Philadelphia, are said to be hard
headed idealists and they are going
to do their talking later. They have
rented a suit of offices, moved in,
and are surrounded with their law
Sbraries and are nowadays pouring
aver the evidence adduced at the
hearings of the Public Lands com*

mittee and running down the evi
dence. They are concerned with facts
and not fiction. They are getting
right down to brass tacks, realizing
ihat it is far easier to indict than it
is to convict. They are not taking
anything for granted but are digging
away at facts and getting what is
necessary to make their big case for
Uncle Sam stick good and hard.
Their first attempts will be to re
cover for the government the naval
oil reserves that were leased by for
mer Secretary Fall to Doheny and
Sinclair interests. Their next step
will be to prosecute those who are
guilty after they have won their
first important step in the case.
Daugherty's Case
As has been indicated before by
the writer Attorney General Daugh
erty is a fighter himself, and he does
not want to retire under fire. Up to
the minute this story was written,
he has given no intimation of what
he intends to do or not do, about re
signing his job He says he is not
going to be hanged without a trial,
and he is standing on his constitu
tional rights. He learned his poli
tical wisdom from Mark Hanna many
years ago in Ohio and it will be re
called that Hanna is the fellow who
originated the “Stand Pat” attitude
in Republican politics.
When it comes to candidates, ev
ery one in Washington is agreed
right now that on ‘the Republican
side that President Coolidge is al
most certain of the nomination. It
looks now as though the Cleveland
convention will be a tame affair and
not much of a fight, unless something
turns up in the meantime to change
the situation.
Hiram Johnson, who is out over
the country beating the bushes, as it
were, does not seem to be getting
anywhere. At least that is what
nearly every one says who talks
about it at all. No one thinks the
California senator is making much of
a dent or impression, at least he is
not believed to be bagging many
delegates. Some politicians here go
so far as to predict the nomination
of the president on the first ballot.
The scrap in the Republican conven
tion will undoubtedly be for the sec
ond place on the ticket and there are
likely to be a number of candidates
for the place.
On the Democratic side of the
fence things are vastly different.
Candidates are thicker than flies
around a molasses barrel, not an oil
barrel. There isn’t any question but
that the candidacy of Mr. McAdoo
has been greatly injured by the oil
investigations and the disclosure of
his connection as an attorney for
Doheny. Whether right or wrong,
whether he had a right to make such
connections or not, he did make
them and with many people this
thing is going to go hard with him
in the coming campaign. If his
name had not been hooked up in this
thing, it did look for a long time as
though the Georgia-New-York-Cali
fornia man had the inside track for
the Democratic nomination and there
are people who today think he will
yet land the plum. But MrAdoo has
received an awful hard jolt on the
jaw that may force him to take the
count.
Several new names are coming to
the front for the Democratic nomi
nation nowadays. There is Houston
Thompson, of the federal trade com-

by the home government.
mission, the man who objected to
George Christian becoming a mem
ber of that body. He is being fre
quently mentioned as a possibility.
Josephus Daniels, the former sec
retary of the navy, is being boomed
by his friends, especially from the
Par Heel state. Mr, Daniels is no
mean politician when he gets started
and he will bear watching.
The many friends of John Barton
Payne are insisting on putting up his
aerial for him and he is not without
support for he has friends among all
classes of Democrats.
Senator Underwood, of Alabama,
keeps pegging away on his candidacy
notwithstanding William Jennings
Bryan puts in a knock on his as too
much wet for Democracy. The one
thing that will kill off his chances
for the Democratic nomination is his
well known opposition to the Ku
Klux Klan. No man can make that
sort of a campaign and get a nomi
nation by any big party.
Democratic Hoosiers are still talk
ing for their junior senator, Mr.
Ralston and the Ralston support is
growing stronger and stronger all
the time, notwithstanding the fact
that the senator himself is not mak
ing a single move in that direction.
He just passes the buck and is let
ting others do all the talking and
manipulating. The only thing that
is being said against his candidacy
is his age. He is thought to be rath
er old to undertake such a tremen
dous strain as filling the presidential
chair.
John W. Davis, of West Virginia,
continues in the spotlight as a strong
man for the Democratic nomination
and he has numerous supporters who
are making themselves heard.
Senator James A. Reed, of Missouri,
is out tearing things up by the root
and making them hum. It is said he
has the backing of William Randolph
Hearst, but many consider that fact
as a liability rather than an asset.
Governor A 1 Smith, of New York,
still looms up as a decidedly wet
candidate and will, no doubt, have
the wet Democrats shouting for him
up until the last minute.
Senator Thomas J. Walsh, of Mon
tana, the battle axe of the senate oil
investigation, is being frequently
mentioned as a strong candidate, but
he too, frowns on such efforts.
Homer Cummings, former national
chairman of the Democratic party,
is also being mentioned.
And Senator Joe Robinson, of Ar
kansas, the minority leader in the
senate is being discussed.
A TTifrd Party!
Many people are predicting that
we will have a third party in the
field, this campaign, a radical party.
Efforts are being made right now to
get Senator LaFollette to head that
party as it is known that support
for such a party must necessarily
come from the great northwest. It
is being pointed out that such a
party might obtain enough votes in
the northwestern group of states so
as to throw the election into the
house of representatives for deter
mination. ...
All of which make a most inter
esting situation at the present time
for contemplation by thinking peo
ple. Meanwhile ’congress is going
right ahead wrestling with the tax
reduction program and members are
wondering what the president will
do when the measure comes up to
the White House for his approval or
rejection. He favors the Mellon bill
and that bill has been beaten in the
house so far and the Garner Demo
cratic bill substituted. President
Coolidge has declared against the
Garner bill and it is believed he will
veto same unless it contains many of
the Mellon tax features which the
president favors.
Will he veto it? If so will it spell
defeat for him?
Or will he change his mind and
sign same?

THE FIERY CROSS
MAYFIELD RECOUNT
PROCEEDING SLOWLY
Twenty-Seven Counties Taken in
First Week—May Take 10
More Weeks
(Bureau of Publication and Kdurntlnn)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 1
Today it was ascertained that the
counters, with the attorneys and sen
ate subcommittee looking on and
other senate employes watching, etc.,
that the Mayfield contest case has
proceeded through a recount of 27
counties. There are something like
264 counties, so it will be seen that
the counters are about one-tenth
through counting ballots in the Tex
as case and they have been on the
job one week.
Judging from this it is going to
take about 10 weeks to count the bal
lots in the Texas case, unless the
men working on the job proceed fast
er than they have the first week.
Senator Mayfield, whose seat is be
ing contested, is feeling pretty good
so far over the results obtained in the
recount. Up to date he has just
about held his own, that is to say the
recount in 27 counties gives him ap
proximately juit about what the Tex
as results garye him, viz., about three
to one when it came to votes for him
self as against his opponent. In on
ly one county has his opponent, Mr.
Peddy, made any appreciable gain.
w r hich was 110 votes. In other coun
ties Senator Mayfield has a little
more than made up in gains over
what he lost in the one county.
Senator Frank Greene, of Vermont,
who is a member of the Mayfield
subcommittee, is unable to attend the
meetings or take any part in the
transactions, on account of having
been accidentally shot one night on
the street in a pitched battle be
tween bootleggers and prohibition of
ficers. Senator Greene is slowly re
covering from his wound, but he will
not be out in time to participate in
the committee work in this case. It
has been arranged that another sen
ator take his place on the subcom
mittee, and it is said that Senator
Bursuin, Republican, of New Mexico,
is the man agreed upon.
Klansmen Cussed by
Capitol Cop

WASHINGTON, D. C., March I.
A member of the capitol police to
day pointed out to the writer two
policemen in the United States
capitol building and with an oath
about a yard long declared the
two officers were members of the
Klan.
He denounced them with all the
vile language he could muster and
then told how the Klan had held
a secret initiation meeting one
night in the capitol building it
self right under the big dome.

OIVERGENY VIEWS ON
ENVIES EXPRESSED
Conference In Washington I<
Called by Five
Churches
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C„ Feb. 25.—Op
posite points of view regarding the
motion picture industry are ex
pressd by the National Motion Pic
ture conference, called in Washing
ton by five churches in their nation
al meetings, and the motion picture
industry, of which Will H. Hayes, for
mer postmaster general, is the head.
The sense of the Washington con
ference is summed up by its state
ment that;
“The political, social and moral
welfare of the world is seriously
threatened by the motion picture in
dustry, which is using its vast pub
licity and educational power to place
itself above and in defiance of all
legal control under the deceptive
claim, twice denied by the supreme
court of the United States, that it is
entitled to freedom of the press and
that it should be regulated only by
laws applicable to the press and’ not
those laws applicable to indecent
amusements.”
At a luncheon given in his honor
by the industry in New York, Thom
as A. Edison, noted inventor, and of
ten called the “father of the motion
picture.” said:
“I believe, as I have always be
lieved, that you control the most
powerful instrument in the world for
good. Whatever part I may have
played in its development was mainly
along mechanical lines. The far
more important development of the
motion picture as a medium for ar
tistic efforts and as an educational
factor is in your hands.
“Remember that you are servants
of the public and never let a desire
for money or power prevent you
from giving the public tne best work
of which you are capablf. It is not
the auantity of riches that counts;
it’s the auality which produces hap
piness, where that is possible.”

The local lodge asserts that the

Return Postage Paid on Out of Town Orders. Free Delivery Service
Friday, March 7, 1924
The real storm broke when Senator
Moses, Republican, of New Hamp
shire, attempted to have inserted in
The Congressional Record a red-hot
campaign speech delivered in St.
Louis last night by Senator James A.
Reed, Democrat, of Missouri, denounc
ing William Gibbs McAdoo for the
S art he has taken with respect to
lessrs. Doheny and Sinclair and oth
ers of their kind.
Cummins Keeps Order
This attempt on the part of the
senator from New Hampshire got
under the skin of Senator Robinson,
Democratic leader, of Arkansas, who
strenuously objected to giving unan
imous consent for such reproduction
in The Record. Senator Moses then
made two or three further attempts
to read the speech of Senator Reed,
so that it would get into The Record
and go to the country via that me
dium and in this effort he was taken
off his feet two or three times by
the president pro tern of the sen
ate, Mr. Cummins, Republican, of
lowa.
However, the senator from New
Hampshire, who is the chairman of
the senate committee on printing
and who knows the ropes, bided his
time, and when the hour of one
o’clock arrived he finally got recogni
tion from the chair for his purpose,
and he then read the fiery speech of
the Missouri senator attacking his
Democratic opponent, Mr. McAdoo.
It was about the only time this
session when the writer has seen the
Democratic minority .leader, Mr.
Robinson, lose his temper, and he
was mad all through and through.
After Senator Moses finished reading
the Reed speech, Senator Robinson
took the floor and proceeded to take
the hide off the senator from New
Hampshire and hang it up on the po
litical fence to dry. It was some
skinning process.
Johnson Speech Inserted
Senator Pat Harrison, of Missis
sippi, who usually gets all the fun
out of life there is to be had, got
the floor and had inserted into The
Congressional Record several speech
es of Senator Hiram Johnson giving
the Coolidge administration particu
lar thunder. And this was supposed
to even up for the skinning Senator
Reed gave Mr. Mcadoo.
Then followed Senator Heflin, Dem
ocrat, of Alabama, who never loses
an opportunity to get into The Con
gressional Record himself, and he
proceeded to take a few falls out of
the Republicans on account of oil
disclosures and other troubles.
The whole transaction took up
about two hours’ time, and it was
some skinning on the parts of sena
tors from both sides of the center
aisle which divides the partisans. In
fact, it was butchering day, and
many hides were strung up on the
political fence in those two hours
for the country to view at its leisure.
All of which caused a new member
of the senate to remark: “Yes, and
the country is the one to suffer for
such performances, for the country
pays the bill every time.”
