SLOW PROGRESS OF THE HAT.
Things are not moving as rapidly
*Os Mr. Bryan’s informants and ad-
Wisers had hoped in the matter of
money for the campaign.
At the South, certainly they exhibit
leaden heels. In Texas a year or so
ago on a certain dull and dreary
Sunday the people of Dallas and a
■ neighboring city put up as much as
* SI,OOO to hear Mr. Bryan deliver his
on “The Prince of Peace.”
fThis year those two towns are con-
* .
’tnbuting very meagerly to the elo
quent and yawning hat. The lecture
?gave them something for their
money, something emotional if not
Really filling, whereas sending away
real cash to some invisible person
’who gives nothing in return, not ev
&n a thrill, must seem an unremun
,erative strain upon the imagination.
'So far as we can hear, the hat is
not threatened with a dropsy in
» Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, the
Carolinas and Virginia, to say noth
ing of the other iSouthern States, any
more than in Texas and —shall we
say Arkansas'? The Hon. Moses
-Gincinnatus Wetmore is full of enthu
siastic forecast and fraught with de
signs upon other people’s pockets.
An Oklahoma person has promised
Übalf of the net results of a lecture
•-tour that may turn out to be as thin
|fcas a February snake. Dockery, of
Missouri, fairly bourgeons with ra
dfent prophecy, and so it goes. But
* nobody comes forward with a
E“wad.” The hat exhibits no bu]g-
mg sides and sagging bottom. In
rginia, as in North Carolina, the
-editors who doubted the wisdom of
Mr. Bryan’s nomination are calling
upon the “Bryan or bust” editors
of three months ago to celebrate
.their hysteria with a tangible obla
tion. In Alabama, they are printing
life-like woodcuts of the Prophet and
handing them around with captivat
ing fluency. In Georgia, they are
■’so busy comparing Springfield of
this year with Atlanta of two years
attgo they cannot think of sordid bus
iness for the present. Meanwhile the
jiat goes on with shrunken ribs and
gaping orifice, a thing of emptiness,
a vision of neglect.
The Charleston News and Courier,
which frankly opposed the leader
ship of Bryan and prophesied the
_ dearth of fervor, now patent to the
"naked eye, is furiously jogging the
* one time enthusiasts:
U “Mr. Bryan has appealed to the
farmers for contributions, he has ap
pealed to the newspapers, and his
committee is beseiging Democrats of
every kind and condition to give the
money that is absolutely necessary to
conduct the campaign. A month has
passed since the convention ad
journed, iand although thenparty man
agers have made it plain to the peo
ple that they look to the people
themselves to supply the funds for
the campaign, the response to
entreaties has been so feeble
asd so scattering as to force the con
clusion that not one man in a thous-
in this part of the country cares
a rap whether Taft is defeated or
not.
‘ ‘ Such pitiful contributions as
have been reported from 'South Caro
lina, have come from four or
five cities and towns. In one
city with a population of 7,000,
forty or fifty persons have giv
en sums of $1 to 50 cents
each, and w r e have seen no single
contribution from any individual in
this >State of more than $5.”
And what will come of it? Maybe
wlien the farmers shall have gather
ed in their hay land other forage,
filled their smoke houses, laid up
the winter’s stock of kindling wood
and pocketed the price of their cot
ton—maybe then, with present abun
dance and a sense of future security
expanding their waistbands, they will
dig up their wallets and proceed to
fill the hat. Maybe not. For the
present, however, the News and Cour
ier flings .at them this galling and
richly earned remonstrance:
“The South Carolina Bryanites
have a glorious opportunity to rebuke
the News and Courier, to show it
that it did not know 7 what it was
talking about when it insisted during
the spring that there was no real en
thusiasm for Mr. Bryan’s nomination
and we sincerely -wish that they
would not let the opportunity pass.”
Alas for the rarity of Christian
charity! For, really, it appears to
have come to that.—N. Y. Sun.
THE CURRENCY QUESTION.
The People’s party is in favor of
the government issuing money direct
to the people instead of to national
banks. At present, and for forty
five years, the government has issued
money to national banks—loaned it
to them, at next to no interest, on
twenty years’ time, with the privi
lege of renewal for a like period of
time at the end of any twenty years.
The banks pay for the use of this
money one-half of one per cent —•
equal to $5 on a thousand. They
loan it at 6 and 8 per cent, and
some western states as high as ten
per cent —equal to S6O, SBO or SIOO
on the thousand. The People’s par
ty would have this money go into
circulation without this heavy toll
to the bank's. It would put the
money into circulation by paying it
out for necessary public improve
ments and by loans to the people on
good security, or both. This does
not mean that " Populists favor an
unlimited issue of money, not by any
means. From the very first start of
the reform movement thirty-two
years ago, reformers have taught
that the value of money depends
on its supply—its volume, and to have
stability in business, freedom from
panic, the supply of money should
not fluctuate but should be fixed at
the right amount and then increased
as the population increases. The
Greenbackers in their day, and the
Populists, demanded a supply of
money equal to SSO per capita. That
would have been a just amount six
teen years ago, but with the piling
up of fortunes
tSlje
since then, so that a few of our rich
est men can tie up sufficient of the
money supply to bankrupt the busi
ness men, squeeze the farmers and
force the ■wage-workers into trarap
dom, with these conditions, there
should be six or seven billion dollars
of money, ’ about S7O or SBO
per capita. There is not half that
at present. -This new money needed
should, the Populists say, be put in
circulation by payment direct to the
people. But Populists do not advo
cate, and never did, an unlimited sup
ply of money. They have always as
serted that the general level of pri
ces is controlled by the supply of
money, and that up and down from
this level the prices of any article
move according to the supply of and
demand for that particular article.
Business becomes lively, and the mas
ses of the people as a whole are pros
perous when there is an increase of
money, and consequently a rise in the
general average of prices, because it
takes less of their property and labor
to pay a. given amount of debt, in
terest and taxes and they have more
to spend for the necessaries, com
forts and luxuries of life. Money is
the life-blood of business. Its issue
should not be- controlled by banking
corporations in their own interests,
but by the government in the inter
est of all the people. This is the
Populist doctrine, and until the peo
ple adopt it, they will be skinned by
the money power.—Missouri World.
“WHY THE SOUTH?”
In the course of a front page ar
ticle in Sunday’s Atlanta Journal,
on the subject of the political effect
of the rate advance, we find these
paragraphs:
“ Why have the railroads chosen to
impose upon the south rather
than some other section this increase
of rates that ■will cost the merchants
and the consumers between a half
million and a million dollars a year?
“Had they inaugurated such an ad
vance in New England or the west it
would cost Taft a million votes.
“They chose the south partly be
cause it has always been the line of
least resistance to their high-handed
extortions, but mainly because they
knew that the south, true to her tra
ditions, would go Democratic, come
what might. Therefore, the big sys
tems, with their palpable preferences
for a Republican administration knew
they had no opportunities to lose in
this southeastern territory.”
This is just as good as an admis
sion of the truth expressed in recent
speeches by Hon. Thos. E. Watson:
That the way to make the south polit
ically important is to make it politic
ally uncertain.
We are heartily glad the Journal
has given attention to this latest in
stance of injustice that the people of
the south have to bear while they re
main “true to tradition,” and bow
down in response to the demands of
the Journal and the rest of the tin
horn brigade, to the lash of the Dem
ocratic party.
It is a queer kind of patriotism
that prompts a freeborn southern
white man to cast his ballot for th®
continuation of the political slavery
we have been suffering since the Civil
War. It certainly cannot be the same
that prompted our'forefathers to spill
their blood rather than to submit to
English injustice, which rang from
them no more sacred rights than
those of which we are now robbed
on account of our servitude to the
bosses of the two big parties.
Think it over, Mr. Voter, and de
cide before the November election
whether to be man or slave. —The
Meigs Review.
THE SLAUGHTER ON THE RAIL
ROADS.
The railroads of the country not
only maintain but increase their rep
utation as the greatest mankillers in
the universe. War, with its horrors and
bloodshed, its killed and wounded,
is a bagatelle beside this slaughter of
the railroads. The number killed on
the Union side in the battle of Get
tysburg, the greatest battle of the
Civil War, was 3,070. The Union
army lost in killed during the entire
four years of that frightful war, 67,-
058 men. The railroads of the
country killed last year 11,839 per
sons, which is very nearly up with the
greatest war of modern times.
The interstate commerce commis
sion has just made public the figures
of the railroad shambles, for the fis
cal year of 1907. According to these
official figures the railroads killed
last year 11,839 persons, and crippled
and injured 111,016, making a total
of 122,855 victims of the railroads.
What an appalling presentation!
Every four minutes and a fraction,
day and night, throughout the entire
year, one human life was snuffed out
or one human victim crushed or
mangled by the railroads. Out of
every 125 trainmen employed through
out the country, one w r as killed last
year, and out of every eight employ
ed, one was wounded. Rarely does
an army show such a fearful record
of losses after the most bloody battle.
Nor is this the worst of it. This
fatality record is continually growing,
and growing in greater ratio than
our railroad extension. The increase
last year over the preceding year
was 1,221 killed, and 13,310 more in
jured. In 1906 one passenger was
killed for every 70,103,735 miles trav
eled, but the killing of passengers so
much increased in 1907 that one pas
senger was killed for every 45,440,-
253 miles traveled.
What is to be done about it? The
death list of our railroads is fearful
ly in excess of the fatality lists of
European railroads, and is steadily
and alarmingly growing every year.
