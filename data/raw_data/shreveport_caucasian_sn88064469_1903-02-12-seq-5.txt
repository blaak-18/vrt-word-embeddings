PMR. ADA LANDON HAND
has the distinction of being,
I believe, the only woman
leader and proprietor of a
men's orchestra. She and her orches
tra furnish music for balls, concerts
and all kinds of entertainments in New
York city and its vicinity. In her girl
hood the lady was an accomplished
pianist. Her strong point was and is
her versatilivy. She caan render a pi
ano solo or a "coon song," acconipany a
prima donna in opera or play dance
music with equal facility. Some years
ago Mrs. Hand was left a widow with
four little boys to support. Music was
her first love, and to it she turned for a
living. When she was only four years
old, she had begun piano playing and
did not leave it off when she was mar
ried. When widowed, therefore, she
faced the future with her four boys
around her and only her dauntless will
and her knowltIge of music between
all of them and homelessness or de
pendence on charity. At first she
taught piano music and played for
evoning entertainments wherever she
could get engagements. She was also
pianist for an orchestra. Then she de
termined to have an orchestra of her
own. She was known and highly re
spected by members of the musical
union. The system she devised is an
elastic one. She obtains an engage
ment for an orchestra of a given num
ber of 'layers, from five to twenty-five.
as is ; ..uted. Then from other orches
tras and from the musical union she
engages here and there the desired
quota, and thus the count is made up.
She herself does not usually conduct
the orchestra In person, because she is
the pianist of the company. She has
had a hard struggle, the hardest part
of it against that prejudice which ever
tries to stamp out women in a new
field, but she is overcoming that. It is
pleasant to record that here Is one wo
man with practically perfect health,
and that is an immeasurable help to
her.
Says the editor of the New York
Evening Journal, ,"The man who is
surly to his typewriter and indifferent
to her feelings will be surly to his
wife and indifterent to her feelings."
For generations men and women
artists have painted from the nude in
the same c(lasses iii Paris, and nothing
evil has been thought of it. Lately a
private studio was opened in Berlin in
which the same practice. was Inaugu
rated. The German police interfered
and demanded either the closing of the
studio or the separation of the art stu
dents along the sex line. The edict was
obeyed for a while. Then matters slid
back. as they had been, and the stu
dents painted in the same class. The
preceptor was of the highest rank; the
students wero men and women with
out exception enthusiasts in their task.
This time, although the authorities
must have been aware of the infrac
tion of their order, the studio was not
interfered with.

MODES FOR THE FAIR.
Something About the New Materials,
GownM and WaiutN.
Of all the old fashioned dress stuffs
nothing is daintier or prettier ti n
challie. The manufacturers have evi
dently thought so, for the stores are
full of the material in over 400 differ
ent designs. Some of them have the
satin stripe over the surface. the latter
having its pattern of tiny houquets or
single flowers. others have crossbars
of the stripes in different colors over
the design, and others, again, have sim
ply the floral design without stripes,
but instead delicate weaving, like lace.
But, no matter what the design is or
its complications, the soft and tiexible
quality of the challie remains. Per
haps the most attractive of all the de
signs is that In which the old pompa
dour figure Is used. We see the chal
lies In every shade and color of this
PRETTY NEW WAISTS.
season, some dark and some even With
black groundwork. But the dainty and
pretty floc'ers are perfeet, epch after
its kind, looking like tiny roses or other
blossoms. Among the designs brought
out In the challies are, besides the flo
ral patterns, Persians, dresdens and
escurials on light or dark grounds.
Some of the challies have a regular
crape twist, which makes them hang
like china crape. They are to be made
into tea gowns as well as other house
dresses, and it is even said that they
will be among the best liked of sum
mer frocks. Lace and ribbon are-ueed
ed to make them all that one could
wish.
Speaking of tea gowns reminds me
that there Is a great revival in the pop
ularity of these graceful if somewhat
careless garments. I mean that the
tea gowns are rather negligee, though
they cost enough to be full dress, with
diamonds thrown in. They are loose
and long and somehow create the idea
that the wearer is making herself com
fortable. and we all know that no wo
man has the right to do that ,in cotm
pany2" Still, the tea gown is here and
will stay.
The tea gowns of this season are in
differestly of surah, liberty, voile, crepe
de chine, poplin, albatross cloth, cash
mere. drap d'ete, panne. chiffon over
silk, challie and India silk. Billows of
lace are placed wherever the fertile
mind of a dressmaker can imagine it.
and there are insets, applications and
more ways and kinds of lace trim
mings than I can remember. All the
skirts are made Into such fluffs of ruf
fles with rulhes of chiffon on the edges
that the bottom sets out in the most
approved fashion. Ribbon is put on In
many ways, even to being added in the
form of "love knots" at one should.r
or another.
Most of the very fine ten gowns are
of china crape in pink, blue or some of
the delicate pastel shades which are
back among this season's colors. Many
have Irish crochet lace boleros, and
others show deep sailor collars of fine
mousseline with an overlay of rich
lace. Others have deep yokes made of
heavy renaissance lace, and, in fact.
one can hat e anything one wants in
the line of tea gowns. Obly the long.
loose shape is preserved.
Shirt waists and other separate waists
are still with us and are likely to re
main. Generally speaking, they do
,not vary much from those of last year.
The principal thing to note about them
is the exceedingly ugly and awkward
sleeve. All the sleeves are built more
or less on the same lines and are cum
bersome and baggy at the. tottom and
made snug at the top. Most often th'
is done by having the top laid in tucks
or folds. A few years ago we had the
"leg o' mutton" sleeves, and they were
very ugly. but they only interfered
with the comfort of your neighbor,
while these bother the wearer most
miserably. They get into the soup and
catch on everything and are not even
pretty. Can any one account for the
vagaries of women's fancies? I cannot.
Plaid silk is quite a fad for waists,
and the woman whose wardrobe lac .
a plaid silk shirt waist is indeed to be
commiserated. All plaid silk or wool
en waists require a little dark velvet
as finish to tone down the warring col
ors.
A new and dainty evening corsage
for a young lady is made to match the
rest of the dress, although it is remov
able. It is made of white dotted silk
mull over, pale blue. There are flat
bands of ribbon to. match the under col
or and narrow ribbons of the same
shade to define the bands. A half
wreath of pink roses crosses the front.
?hd whole design is very girlish.

and there Is a sailor collar of Irish

How a Girl
Should ' Choose
Her Friends
*6 WONDER if all girls realize how
important It is for them to
make the right kind of friends,"
remarked the married woman
as she poured out a cup of tea for her
girl visitor.
"Male friends for me'" interposed
the latter as she helped hersel t' to a
toasted muttin.
"And that's a great mistake. too,"
went on the married wotra r. "Male
friends, if you wish. but they never
can take the place of the friends of
your own sex. Then there's this dis
advantage, too-one never knows how
long they are going to last-as friends."
"That's true," admitted the girl,
reaching over for a stuffed olive. "lout
if you knew what heartrending experi
ences I have had with friends of my
own sex perhaps you wouldn't be so
surprised at my attitude."
"But, my dear child. perhaps you
were unfortunate. Perhaps they didn't
happ~en to be whole hearted people."
"Ah, well," drawled the girl, "that
you can judge for yourself. I chose
them naturally from the ranks of so
ciety, the people we go with. Perhaps
that's why. However, here are a few
of the different kinds I have had to
contend with:
"First.-There's the friend who is al
ways trying to make you feel her su
periority. If you give a luncheon par
ty, she will let you know just how
much more gorgeous hers of the next
week is to be, or if she has not the
money to give one she will tell you how
much more gorgeous hers could be.
"Second.--Then there's the friend
who manages you, who tells you how
to do your hair. how to walk. how to
think and how to breathe, and she and
you get along all right as long as you
do exactly as she says.
"Third.-Then there's the opposite of
No. 1-namely, the friend who makes
herself as piteous as possible and
whines into your patient ears contin
ually. That's so you will do things for
her. and when you do. If you're fool
ish, she up and denounces you as a stin
gy thing because you didn't do better.
To this class belong Mi rs. and the Misses
Toady, who throw ashes on their own
heads and lick your exalted feet while
they make capital of you every minute
of the twenty-four hours.
"Fourth.-Then there's the well mean
ing but critical one. She is never con
tented with the general appearance of
things. b~ut she must forever spoil her

pleasure and yours by dissecting and
analyzing. Just wear a new dress when
she calls and see how well dissatisfied
you will be with it before she leaves.
"Fifth.-Then there's the friend who
is jealous of you (and you get plenty
of those if you're at all attractive). She
only invites you to meet her fustiest
and least worth while friends, and. as
for men-oh, sorrow, never! But she
loves you very dearly. and these little
omissions always happen by a mere
hairbreadth, so you have to remain on
outwardly friendly terms with her.
"Sixth.-Perhaps worst of all is the
friend who openly. and shamelessly
'pulls your leg.' as the vulgar saying
is, who says when she hears you know
the rich Mrs. So-and-so, '1 wish you
would Introduce me to her.' or-but
why discuss the disgusting type? You
know her As well as I do."
"B',t, my dear," ejaculated the mar
ried woman, a trifle 'shocked. "the un
married girls may be like this. I sup
pose they're on the make, so to speak.
but the married women, those who have
experience of life, they can be true
friends to you, they can give you a
practical chance of bettering yourself,
they can teach you tn know your own
self, best of all, to believe in your own
self, and to succeed."
The girl looked full at her friend
with a glance somewhat tinged with
sarcasm. "The married women?" she
repeated. Then she laughed. "The
married women? They invite the girls,
lure them on with false hopes and then
make backgrounds of them for their own
more mature and therefore superior
powers of brilliancy and cleverness.
Oh, no, no! There is hardly a belle who
succeeds nowadays who has done so
without counting as her most danger
ous rivals the very ones who ought to
