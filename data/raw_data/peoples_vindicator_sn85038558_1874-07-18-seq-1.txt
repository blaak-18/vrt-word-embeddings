LETTERS.
ANNIE HOBERTISON NOXON.
To-night, love, I break the cold fetters,
Which have bound me for many a day ;
And softly I touch the old letters,
Once mor'nfully folded away.
AMd faintly an incense is starting
From their pages, so precious to me,
Ere I dreeamed that an hour of parting
Between us, my darling, could be.
I remember the touch of your fingers,
And the light in your tender blue eyes;
Like the scent of the rose leaf that ling'ers
Round the spot where the dead blossom
lies.
Each word, then so thoughtlessly uttered,
Returns to my memory to-night,
Like the swallows, whose wary wingt
flattered,
Round the-branch where she first saw the
light.
And I wonder if the pang of regretting
E'er wrings from your bosom a sigh :
Or are you in exile, forgetting
The years that so far backward lie I
I read now with tears the old pages,
With tears that are needless and vain;
And I know that time never assuages
Some griefs that are keener than pain.
The White League.
ITS PLATFORMI IN FULL.
t
A MANLY AND STRAITFORWARD DOCU- t
MENT. ii
a
I From the N. 0. Picayu.e. n -
It having been alleged or implied a
that the White League is a secret or- a
ganization, and therefore open to ad- a
verse criticism and remonstrance, we t
have concluded to publish in full the t
address of the Crescent City White a
League, a manly, simple, patriotic do- r
cunent, whereof we gave a synopsis
in our edition of yesterday. If it con- 11
tains one proposition on which every a
honest, well-meaning citizen of Louis- a
iana cannot unite, we are unable to t
discover it ; if there is one principle d
in all its coghmassh which militates 1;
agaiinst truth, reason or our common v
advancement and prosperity, we can- d
not point it out. c
We submit the platform of the Cres- c
cent City White League, believing c
that it can and will be made the plat- a
forn of the white race in Louisiana : c
The Crescent City Democratic Club r
of 1868, having changed its name to a
that of "Crescent City White League," r
has thought that an explanation was t
due alike to its retired members m
and to the peoplb of New Orleans-ef a
the motives of a change so seriously t
and so sadly suggestive: a
It may be stated that the elements I
of personal character and of general a
purpose in the club have undergone
no change since its origin. Our mem- t
bers, with but few losses or accessions, I
are the same as for many years past, ,
and we feel ourselves animated as I
ever by the same earnest determina
tion to strive in the task of practical
politics to establish and maintain
such government in the State and
city as shall guard the liberties of the
citizen, his business and the accumu
lations of his industry.
Our fellow-citizens will permit us
to recall with a just pride our stren- I
uous and persistent efforts in this be. i
half, though they have again and
again1 been ;prostrated by the fatal i
intrusion of a high hand whose vio.
lence was stronger than our rights.
All our struggles had been hitherto
conducted under the ancient banner
r of Democracy, to which we shall ever
look for guidance in all national con
tests. But we are now fast drifting
to a conflict bounded by the limits of
the State, and which the men of Louis
iana alone must settle, if justice and
fair play shall rule and not Federal
B violence. It is a conflict not invol
' iing a single issue upon which an
honest Republican can possibly dif
fer as such from an honest Democrat,
a conflict the decision of which we
would confidently and gladly remit to
the votes of the very Radicals of New
England, nay to any body of civilized
men in the world; for it is a conflict
between virtue and depravity--be
tween enlightenment and thick ig
norance, between civilization and bar
bariam--a barbarism artificially stim
ulated and held up by the perverted
authority of the most civilized nation
in the world; a civilization whose cry
not for help against threatened des
truaction, but for mere fair play in
maintaining itself, is answered from
Washington by insults and a blow.
In this dire emergency the National
Democracy is powerless to afford re
lief. The National Republican party,
Sabsorbed in its dream of future do
mination, and quarreling over present
schemes of tience, has forgotten
g that there is such an outlying pro
vince as Louisiana, which it might
Sresuene from perdition and disgrace
for the sake of the good name of the
National.Commonwealth.
Need we draw a picture of our ut
ter desolation ? Need we point on
Sthe one hand to our devastated felds,
11 our warning commerce, our idle work
shops, our decreasing population, our
increasing taxes, o~r pauper multi
tudcs, prensioners on alien chantt,
and, on the other hand, to the orgies tlh
of the ignoble wretches forced upon vi:
us as rulers by the horrible alliance ho
between negro ignorance and the CUn- no
ning of Washington bureaucracy, ru- th
lors grown ticld, amidst general dis- en
tress, and rei a,,g in the proceeds of ed
taxes wrung ImeC a gaspirg people, th
rulers painfuity ftiuintained by nation- lei
al bayonets in positions reeking with on
dishonor and felonu., and from whicll all
there would need 'be but one wild foi
hour of unrestained anger to hurl them all
forever I no
Need we repent the old story of go
brutal violence stalking at midnight in
in the draggled shroud of judicial wl
authority and under the shadow of an
the Federal power, enthroning an ex- lit
ecrable oligarchy of the most igno. wi
rant and profligate negroes, leagued ur
with the most dangerous class of re- of
pacious whites, the very scum of so- sa
ciety ! America has rung with the hii
echo of these wrongs, and we have ru
heard even those who have made it a lil
system to hate us raise their voices in ar
denunciation of the wrong-doers, anid ur
yet not a hand has been lifted to de- isi
liver us from their oppressions.
With our hands on our hearts and gr
appealing to God, we and the whole a
white people of Louisiana can delare tr'
that we are in. no way responsible wi
for the intolerable evils of misgovern- Ibl
muent under which the State is perish- G,
ing. From the time that the right til
of suffrage was, as we believed, and frl
we still believe, accorded too hastily fr,
to a race in the infancy of freedom, ki
we firmly resolved that it was our du- th
ty, and a wise expediency to acc,,pt ti
the policy of the reconstruction laws th
in their full scope. We endeavored HU
at once to address ourse!ves to the in- w;
telligenco of the negro, to explain to st
him that slavery having been forever or
abolished, he, as a citizen possessing to
all the rights of white eitizens, had all
the same interests and the same du- It
ties as white men. Our orators and at
our press plied him with the obvious
reasoning on these subjects. We in- w
vited him ,ti our meetings, we called cc
him to our platforms, we placed some co
of them upon our tickets. Election o,
after election they turned a deaf ear o0
to us; treated all our advances with of
distrust and suspicion; unhesitating- re
ly fallnwvd the leraduhi p of men: in
whom they knew to be unworthy and "so
dishonest, and with scarcely an ex- pc
ception invariably voted like a body Si
of trained soldiers obeying a word of b,
command. We still hoped that time n,
and experience would give them dis- at
cretion in the exercise of a precious ai
right, which they never exercised here fe
or else where except as a gift from our ri
race. We thought that a right which o;
they owed to the white race would m
not be persistently used by them to ti
accomplish the ruin of white men. In r,
this hope we have been most griev- ti
ously disappointed. The negro has
proved himself as destitute of cem
mon gratitude as of common sense.
Instead of improving in his capacity tl
to make an intelligent and patriotic e
use of the ballot, we do not hesitate to a
affirm that he is to-day less qualified ti
for the duties of self-government than dl
he was seven years ago. In the be
ginning we are willing to believe that '
he was guided by a childish faith in k
the bad control of his vote. But a
though he has long since lost that
faith; though the barefaced rascali- a
ties of those men are now known to
Ihim:though he denounces thenm as
liars and thieves, lie still retains them
in positions of power and trust for the a
I avowed purpose of breaking down
1 the industry of the State, wasting it a
-by exorbitant taxation, and finally
- driving its white inhabitants to other
States.
r Any one who has been to their
r meetings, or overheard their private a
conversations, knows that they dream a
gof the gradual exodus of the whites,
which will leave Louisiana to their
i exclusive control like another Hayti.
1 The increasing spirit of caste found
I ed on thie most absurd inversion of the
- relations of race, shows itself in every
n form. Their incessant demands for
- offices from the State, city nd Fede
, ral Government, for which they are
e unfit, and to which they have no ti
o tle other than the color of their slkin;
V the development in their conventions
d of a spirit of proscription against
st white Radicals and even against hon
- orable Republicans who fought in the
- Northern armies for thei r hberation; 1
- their inoereasing arrogance, which 1
- seems to know no bounds; their in- I
d creasing dishonesty, which they re
nt gard as a statesmanly virtue ; their m
y contemptuous scorn of all the rights
m- of the white man which they dare I
in trespass upon. All these signs warn I
m us that the clalamity which we had 4
. Ilong apprehended is now imminent, 1
al andthat we most be prepared for all
l- its consequences. Disregarding all
y, minor questions of principle or poli
- cy, and having solely in view the
itlmaintenance of our hereditary civil
n ization and Christianity menaced by
s- a stupid Africanisation, we appeal to
ht the men of our race, of whatever lan
e guage or pnationality, to unite with us
Sagainst that supreme danger. A
league of the whites is the inevitable
I- result of that formidable, oath-bound
m and blindly obedient league, of the
is, blacks, which, nhder the command of
k- the most cunning and unscrupulous
mr negroes in the State, may at any mo
:i- ment plange us into a war of races-
y, a conlict in which we are resolved
that we and ours shall not be the
victims. Indeed, it is with some
hope that a timely and proclaimed
union of the whites as a race, and
their efficient preparation for any
emergency, may arrest the threaten
ed ho rors of a social war, and teach T
the blacks to beware of further inso
lence and aggression that we call up
on the men of our race to leave in
abeyance all lesser cuanisierations; to t*
forget all differences of opinions and nI
all prejudices of the past, and with ao
no object in view but the common
good of both races, to unite with us ta
in an earnest effort to re-establish a si
white man's government in the city ni
and the State. Were the negro wil- an
ling to listen to the voice of reason, A
we could demonstrate even to his oi
understanding that the predominance :
of our race in government is indispen- o,
sable to his well being. We could show oi
him that in every Southern State is
ruled by the whites his rights to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
are moue firmly secured than they are
under the black domination in Lou- tr
isiana. p
We could show him that the ne- I
gro's right to vote, to labor, to secure s5
a tenure of the profits of his indus- p
try, are far better guaranteed by the Ih
white rulers of Virginia than by the b
bl'ack rulers of Louisiana; that in of
Georgia and in Texas every jot and s,
title of his legal and constitutional m
franchises-his life, his immunity ea
from wrong and oppression of every b
kind-are far better guarded than in d
those States in which his race is in a'
the ascndency. We would show him ai
that where the white man rules, the o0
negro is peaceful and happy; that g
where the black rules, the negro is
starved and oppressed; that where
our race bears away, his race is men
tally, morally and materially progres
sing; that where his race governs,
there is increasing ignorance, distress
and brutality.
But it is worse than idle to reason
with those people. They have be
come maddened by the hatred and
conceit of race, and it has become 2
our duty to save them and to save
ourselves from the fatal probabilities
of their stupid extravagance and
reckless vanity, by arraying ourselves C
in the amae of-white elvllttzaton, re
saming that just and legitimate su
periority in the administration of our
State affairs to which we are entitled i
by superior responsibility, superior
numbers and superior intelligence;
and while we declare it is our purpose
and fixed determination not to inter
fere in any manner with the legal
rights of the colored race, or of any
other race, we are determined to
i maintain our own legals rights by all 1
the means that may become necessa- a
ry for that purpose, and to preserve
them at all hazards.
John Maroney said it wasn't his fault
that he had been arrested for vagran

secure a situation, but everybody
turned a cold shoulder. Bank Presi
dents said it wans't a good day for
hiring cashiers; wholeeale merchants
said they didn't want a head book
keeper that day, and leading jewelers
t advised him to go and learn how to
hang himself. Thus he was rebuffed
and discouraged at every turn. His

It costs fifty cents to produce a

This estimate is based upon a half
Iale of cotton, twelve bushels corn,
and fifty bushels potatoes per acre.
Should the producer have to buy
any considerable quantity of his corn,
the cost of cotton will not lie less than
15 cents per pound of lint.

RAMsIxo Cows.--Many fail by tak
ing too long It time to grow a cow.
We believe ilt keeping young animals
grou oing all the time. o With pood
care and plenty of good food, it Is as
Seasy to have a heifer paying her peep
ing at two years old as to wait till
Sshe is three. We claim that nothing
but a system of starvation and neg
lect requires three years to bring a
calf to maturity. The cost of carry.
ing a heifer. through her third year
before calving we contend, is nearly
,all thrown away, It is no small sat
- isfaction to the owner of a good herd
U of milk cows to know that they are
all acquainted, and are on good terms
with each other; that they know no
other home, and are perfectly content
Sed to remain in it. We seldom see
Scattle fighting or injuring each other
which have always been together. It
is the strange cow in the yard that
sets them all in a fury. If cows can
n never do their best at the pail unless
they are quiet and contented, what
may be expected of them where they
rt are changed about from one strange
le yard to another? We have kuown
at instances of two cows being brought
n together at home-at home they were
:- good cows, but in their new quarters
Is they were almost worthless from con
id stant fighting for the mastery, Ifyou
is would have quiet, peaceable and con
on tented stock, raise it yourself and
i- handle it daily from calfhood to ma
turity.-New England Farmer.
