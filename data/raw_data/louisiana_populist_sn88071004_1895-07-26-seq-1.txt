A FEW PREDICTIONS.
MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN
FEW WORDS.
What an English Paper Predlete in Re
gard to the Future of This Country, In
Consequence of Existing Coadtloes, lee
qualAtles and Iejestlees.
Thinking people all over the world
cannot falil to be impressed with the
situation in America to-day.
The government founded by the
patriots of the revolution has been
the admiration of the world.
The resources of the most favored
portion of the earth have contributed
to our greatness.
Our boasted liberty has attracted
the attention o! every student of polit
ical problems.
In every nation of the globe lead- I
ing minds are watching with hopeful
eyes the outcome of our attempt to
establish and maintain a government
of, for and by the people.
In this connection it is interesting I
to note the opinions of watchful peo
plie who have noted passing events
and are disinterested witnesses.
The following is from the -*London
Echo," and as such is of more than
usual interest.
It is worth the careful attention of
every American.
The Echo says:
"*The signs of the times indicate
that before the sun rises on June 1,
1'00J, the great American nation will
groan and writhe in an agony of rev
olution and the streets will be slip
pery with blood.
*-A hundred drops of blood for
each gem that flashes on the necks of
the rich and pampered women, and
ten drops of blood for each tear that
has washed the fach of the poor. i
* 'Every election is carried by fraud -
and boodle. Politics is so rotten that
it stinks. 1
",Everybody knows it, and nobody ,
cares.
"-America is no longer a republic.
It is a plutocracy.
"*The president is merely the crea
tion of the banks. or bank directors,
railroad kings and coal barons. and
It is the same with the governors of
the states.
*"The poor whine about their pov
erty and gnaw their crust of bread. G
but can always be counted on to vote t
for the rich and shoulder their musk- -
ets and lay down their lives in de
fense of the right of the rich to rob ,
them. "
*"A nation such as this, in which. t
one million plutocrats tyrannize over
sixty millions of slaves, will either be
overthrown by a foreign power or d
drowned in its own blood or die of
gangrene.
"*The various labor organizations
neither think together, vote together
nor work togetner, and they have no
money to b.iy votes. lawyers and
judges. ii
"-Soldiers and police shoot down g
laboring people and are cheered on in a
their bloody work by monopolistic 1
editors, capitalists and the clergy. ii
"-.But the day will soon come when
there will be a horrible dance to
death, lighted up by burning houses
and the music of cries and groans
and dynamite bombs. 0

bonds in order to redeem the green
backs?
There is no law authorizing the
4 government to redeem the greenbacks
in gold or anything else, but the law
expressly says they shall not be re
deemed nor retired.
To redeem means to take in and
a destroy or retire from circulation. As
the greenbacks cannot be retired,
they cannot be redeemed.
The excuse that $100.)00,000 in
gold must be kept in the treasury to
d redeem the greenbacks is the product
e of the gold gamblers.
They force the government to keep
e a certain amount of gold in the treas- t
a ury, well knowing that it cannot be t
done without the issue of bonds. C
d The demand that the greenbacks t
3 be redeemable in gold by implication i
in order to force the government to s
i keep the gold on hand, and in order
also to enable them to draw out and d
force a sale of bonds to procure more t
gold. t
The gold reserve is nothing but a
3 species of robbery of the people for
t the benefit of the money gamblers. t
The next congress should abolish this t
gold reserve by law. Let this means c
of robbing the people be rooted out.
, -Southern Mercury.
Yes, but the next congress will do
nothing for the people-it is Repub
lican. The results would be the
same were it a Democratic house. d

DAMNABLE DECISION.
THE SUPREME COURTS' ACTION
CONDEMNED.
The Income Tax Decisio "Is a Crime
Against the Commom People, a Pot
srned Dirk Driven Into the Vitals of
the American Republic."
The decision of the supreme court
in the income-tax case has placed this
nation twenty years nearer a revolu
tion that may terminate in a reign of
terror. It has issued to the pluto
crat a patent of nobility-declared
that he belongs to a privileged class
in nowise amenable to the laws that
govern the proletarian. It has erected
a barrier between Dives and Lazarus,
drawn the line of battle between the
Cormorant and the Commune. It has
transformed the federal constitution
from a palladium of liberty into an
instrument of oppression, the tool of
tyranny. That decision is a challenge
to destiny, a red blanket in the face
of an infuriated bull, a mockery of
Samson by foolish Philistines as he
stands blind and desperate, his brawny
arms encircling the pillars of our po
litical temple. It is a crime against
the common people, a poisoned dirk
driven into the very vitals o! the
American republic, a foul blasphemy
of liberty, equality and fraternity, the
terrestrial trinity of our fathers.
Doubtless the occupants of the su
preme bench resemble Brutus in that
they are -"all honorable men;" but if
such a halting, illogical and every
way infamous verdict had been
brought in by a petit jury there
would have been more than a sus
picion of bribery. The decision as
handed down by Chief Justice Fuller
reads like the special pleading of a
jack-leg lawyer, employed to defend a
rich but notorious robber caught de
spoiling the pantries of the poor.
Talleyrand declares that language
was made to conceal thought:
but even the opaque verbal
flood in which the decision
floats like a grisly skeleton in a sea of
slime, cannot concel the fact that
Fuller knew the ruling was both dan
gerou. and damnable. Like the lady
in the play, he doth protest too much
-consumes an hour in a dismal fail
ure to establish a radical difference
between tweedledum and tweedlede.
It reminds one of the plea of Queen
Elizabeth that she possessed a caval
ry regiment of which neither horse
nor man could be hurt, viz., a regi
ment of tailors on mare. lie is too
evidently arguing to his own cou
science, which, like the dead Banquo,
will not down.
The four dissenting justices did not
accuse their associates of corrrup
tion: but they did charge them with
having committed a crime -with hav
ing instituted adepotism of wealth.
with having deliberately endangered
the existence of the American gov
ernment by an abortive science of def
inition. Never before in the history
of the supreme court did the dissent
ing justices express such indignation
over a decision or intimate so plainly
that their associates were either fools
or knaves. The vigorous, almost in
sulting protests of the dissenting jus
tices; the tremendous monetary inter
ests at stake, together with the
scholastic hair-splittings, argumenta
tive writhings and illogical twistings,
and turnings that distinguish the de
cision, may mean much or little ac
cording to the strength of the critic's
confidence in the incorruptibility of
the court. For my own part, I do
not believe that the betrayal of the
people was the result of direct bribery,
as in the case of Benedict Arnold; but
I do delieve that such pressure was
brought to bear by the plutocracy
upon our court of last resort as to
shamefully defeat the ends of justice.
All men are more or less malleable,
and several members of our supreme
court exceptionably so-veritable
Trilbys in pants, who find it ,difi
cult to say nay to earnest pleading."
The decisions is simply an official
notification that upon the shoulders
of the poor must continue to rest the
burthen of taxation. The court de
cided, by a vote of 6 to 4, that a tax
aIncome arising from interest or
rent is direct," therefore unconsti
tutional unless apportioned among
the several states on a basis of popu
lation; while a tax on ioome derived
from labor, prefessional service or
merchandising is "'indirect" and may
be imposed at the pleasure of con
grees and without apportionment.
The gross injustice of such a
ruling is too palpable to re
quire comment, wbiel its utter
absurdity must be evident to every
mian capable of reasoning from a pre
mse to the simplest oosclusion. A
Lae an annual Inoome of $I,000,000,
derived from the rental of real estate
or laterewst oae eapital invested is semu
rithles; B has am income of $1,000, de
rined from the eoeupstlon of mer
Lchant or mabaist, butoheror baker.
Congres, aoording to the supceme
eort, msy, bya simple *,Be it ea
ated," tax the petty income of B,
but is forbidden to toueh the colossal
lesome of A except by appurtoloment,
rwhen it becomes the province of each
etate to msay how Its pro rata shalal be
provided. A tasx on the ilndvid
sal arsag o B is *·Itir,,ets"
SE,
while a tax on the the revenues of A, ,
drawn second-hand from the efforts
of others, is -direct"--perhaps on
the theory that "two negatives make
a positive." The federal government
can shove its hand as deeply as it
likes into the pocket of labor, but
cannot touch one penny in the thous
and pounds in the overflowing coffers
of the capitalists. So says the court.
How is that for the fundamental law
of a land that poses in the face of
heaven as -"the refuuge of the world's
oppressed "
And what is the reply to this com
plaint? '"Apportionment." Appor
tion hell-between the west and the
south' Justice Harlan truly says that
"*No such apportionment can possibly
be made without doing monstrous,
wicked injustice to the many for the
benefit of the favored few in particu
lar states." Do those "-able editors,"
short-horse politicians and other hi
tellectual animalculaŽ now echoing
the word like lost burros braying for
company, know what constitutional
apportionment of the public burden
means? It means that when the fed-,
erate government desires to raise a
sum of money by such method each
state must contribute thereto, not in
proportion to its taxable wealth,
but according to its population, no
matter how poverty-stricken its peo
ple. It means that one state must
put up as much for a merchanic out
of employment, or a farmer with a
mortgaged crop, as another for a
Rockfeller or a Gould. The privilege
of taxing the great incomes by the
method of apportionment simply
means that labor is at perfect liberty
to bite off its nose to spite its face,
then leap from the frying pan into
the fire. No political party will ever
dare perpetrate such an infamy as
the apportionment of the income tax.
Not even the supreme court-t'hat pit
iful cat's-paw of the plutocracy-had
the audacity to indorse it.
While a portion of the law was de
clared constitutional, it was all killed
-the tail was permitted to go with
the hide. The law was aimed at
large incomes, many of which are
drawn neither from rent or interest;
but the court denied the axiom that
"*half a loaf is better than no bread."
It practically decided that should the
government draft two men for war,
and one escape, it would hasten to
discharge the other, instead of mus
tering him in and sending a sergent
after the runaway. The decision
means that we cannot compel men to
contribute to the support of govern
ment according to their means until
we have a constitution which the plu
tocrat. with friends at court, cannot
possibly pervert-or the people de
cide that patience has ceased to be a:
virtue. It means that wealth has de
creed that consumption shall bear
the burden-that tariff reform and
reduced excises are, for the present
at least. '-an iridescent dream." It
means that no matter how imminent
the peril of the government, or press
ing its need. it is powerless to com
pel the plutocrat to contribute of his
means to the defense of our flag. It
means, as Justice Brown expressed
it, "The submerges e of the liberties
of the people in a sordid despotism of
wealth." It means that the people.
who have ever looked to the supreme
court for protection from outrage and
oppression, will henceforth regard it
as the slave of their enemies. It
means general dissatisfaction and
growing unrest, until, despairing of
righting his wrongs in the name of
reason, the Titan will put forth his
terrible strength, and the govern
ment of the United States of America
will thenceforth live -'only in the i
tomb of the world's history."

if the working people could
see the glaring fraud and
would vote for the public ownership

man would then have an elegant

have the advantages that now oaly
the rich, who do not work, have.
