Many of the gowns of the day have

The new aspect of the blouse is of
importance. The exaggerated pouch

fits well into that new feature, the high
shaped directoire belt. This belt in
stead of cutting the figure abruptly in

its graceful curves, and, with a deep

Paris Likes the Sun Ray Model-A
Good Shape For Light Fabrics.
Paris at present is certainly pressing
home the desirability of the sun ray
skirt; but, while none can deny the
charms of this mode, its adaptability
to the exigencies of home manufacture
is doubtful. None but the most skill
ful of workers, if even they, could do
the plaiting without mechanical aid.

material away to be kilted.
No such difficulty, however, is found

back in one, three seams in all. It

One of the most popular skirts at the t
present moment is found in the second t

It answers equally well in a light ma- b

A FORTY-NINER DENTIST.
Outdoor Ofiee, High Prices and Nug
gets For Filling.
A smooth bowlder for a chair, high
towering walls of impregnable granite
for walls and the blue sky for a roof
were the unique conditions surround
ing what was probably the first dental
office in California. The dentist was
Dr. S. M. Harris. then known as "Lit
tle Doc," today mayor of Grass Valley,
Nevada county.
This odd dental offce was founded
In the day when ncun rocked cradles
with more cherished burdens than new
born babes; when caravans of people
flocked into Caiifornia in search of
gold; when the founders of this great
state took up their habitation in a
wild and desolate country.
When you arrived at Dr. Harris' of
fice. there was a noticeable absence of
the plush covered chair and o'ther ac
coutermaents which usually mark the
dentist's office. There was no drill run
by foot power, no bulb to wash out the
cavity. For a chair the smooth bowlder
on which Dr. Harris sat when rocking
his cradle answered this requisite. For
a drill short pieces of wira were used,
and when a cavity was ready for fill
ing and needed cleansing with water
the patient was handed a tin dipper.
and the stream furnished the water.
The charge for this work was rather
in advance of present day fees, but
there was never trouble over a pay
ment after an aching member was ex
tracted. One-half ounce of gold-the
equivalent of $8--was the fee for ex
traction, and for filling double that
amount.
When a patient arrived. there wete a
few formalities to go through, as in
most cases neither knew the other. If
the case was one of extraction, the
dentist would go to his camp and get a
pair of foree s-the only article be
longinlg to the dentist's kit which he
then owned-and extract the tooth;
but, on the other hand, if filling was
the requirement, the process was of a
more slow and tedious nature. The
patient having a cavity to fill would
usually make an appointment for Sun
day. as a good part of a day was neces
sary for the operation.
Thedoctor would go to his campfire,
which was situated about fifty feet
from his cradle, and temper his instru
ments. Here a small bowlder answered
very well for a forge. When the tools
were got into shape, work was begun
on the patient.
Small pieces of wire from six to eight
inches in length and flattened out con
stituted the excavators. Constant rub
bing of a smooth rock, just as a knife
is sharpened on a whetstone, kept them
sharp. Fillings were made from gold
nuggets scraped with a pocketknife in
to small shavings, then amalgamated
with mercliry. Silver coin was also
used at times, although silver was a
very scarce article in that day. A
heavy piece of wire served as a plugger
to insert the filling. When this filling
crystallized, It made a very lasting one.
Every day while Dr. Harris worked
his claim he had one or more patients.
For the reason that he came to Call
fornia to hunt gold and not to fill teeth
he did not encourage business. As the
country settled around him the pioneer
dentist turned his practice over to oth
ers who came In later, and when he
left that section he did not leave them
without a dentist. - San Francisco I
Chronicle. -
Had a Large Family.
It is said that a farmer living near
Fulton was standing in his barnyard a
few days ago when a well dressed
stranger leaned against the fence and
inquired how much he would take for
one of the cows in the lot.
"One hundred dollars," was the reply.
"I'll take her," said the man. "Can
you give me two more like her?" ,
The farmer drove two more out of
the barn and offered the three to the
stranger for $300."
"All right," said the stranger, begin
ning to climb the fence. "I want them
to furnish milk for my children."
"How many children have you?" ask
ed the farmer in some astonishment.
"Ninety-three," was the calm reply.
The farmer was just getting ready
to ask the man his name, with the pur
pose of sending an account of his life
and public services to President Roose
velt, when two guards from the Fulton
Insane asylum appeared and led the
stranger gently away. - Kansas City

Lord Lovat's Collapse.
An interesting feature of the recent
army debate in the house of lords was
the collapse of Lord Lovat, who, on
rising to make his maidenrspeech, said,
"My lords. I venture to think this army

scheme"- and then sat down, unable
to utter another word. His failure in
the house of lords was such a contrast
to Lord Lovat's gallant work in the
South African war, during which Ile
raised and commanded a corps of
scouts and won the distinguished serv.

good natured comment in the English
papers. One writer points out that I
