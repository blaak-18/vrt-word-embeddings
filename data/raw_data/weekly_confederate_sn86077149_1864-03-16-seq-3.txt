.-i.ls, it is a habitual courtey oi ioe
to pav the railing editor some component
at his withdrawal. This is a common manifes
tation ol the ' fpril da corpx." Hut Mr.
Ih hhn h:.s Hip't.d-d suspended in mys-
ten
t.-rms, under extraorouniy t-utu n-
Ptancts; and as lar as we liave been able to
fee, no word of sympathy, no expression of j
regret has followed him into -retirement ; a
col 1. .-u:dkd and meaning silence, as though
ne had h it of whom good cannot be sp ken
Rt-.d towauU whom forbear nice indicates si
lence, lias Mr. Holden seen this? Does it
make no impres-iou upon him ?
While such has been lhe egect on. public
setimcnt o.utside the State, h .w has it been
lure? Ali the pipers of Xoith Carolina are
" do-tim-iive.- though Mi. II )Mn chooses
. . ..V. a llii. v-hvi tht'V differ with him.
Hut the Fayetteville Observer, the Greeiisboro' i
Fatrio: and' the Salisbury Watchman, might
give Mr. lloldon a ticket of admittance to, or
dismissal fr. m the party with which he has ;
Veen acting for the last two years, without
arrogance. But for him to assume to dimiss
them : it is Mr. Huldenism unmistakable. Let
Mr. Holden ponder the sentiment of these
p;esse. and while pondering ak himself, who
stand by him in North Carolina? The
IVople's Fress at Salem, the Ncwbern Times,
Yankee, and one half-ar. !-half neutral md
cquivtval. and one p K-itively with emphasis
neutral. We say nothing of the papers which
Mr. Holden calls " Destructive'
Now, what effect. haa Mr. Holden produced
on our soldiers? He has made them believe
the cause unworthy, the country whipped,
the Government despotic, thcmseUes wronged
ami illtreated and thus induced many to
desert. And it is well known among our
officers, that in their last moments these
dying men luve attributed their guilt and
their punishment' to Mit. IIolpen.
The con fesHon of James King, which we

We understand that a secret pamphlet is in

themselves no concern about these things.
We do not. We expect assault from traitors
and tories and would not be surprised at any
time to have one from Gcrge Mills Joy,Yankee.

From the Montgomery Advertiser.
The campaign through which the army of
this Depaitrnent has just, passed, has been
fruitful of many incidents, and profitable in
demonstrating the ability of the South to
maintain its liid-pendeuco. -
The Federal newspapers have for more than
- 1... K. n All. ..I r-ith thn n ..UK nt thf
fix weeks been filled with the plans of the
gieat Southwestern campaign. Sherman was
to invade Mississippi with three columns.
One the iarger to leave Vicksburg ; anoth
er, Western Tennessee, down the Mobile and
Ohio Railroad : aud the third was to land at
Pasjgoula. These three columns were to
unite at ' some point, capture Mobile, then
Montgomery, and occupy ail of Mississippi,
and t hat portion' of the Stated of A.abama
west of the Alabama river. To aceornp ih
this grand object, Sherman was given 70,000
veteran troops.
The expedition s largely planned was in
augurated by the moving of the two first col
umns Sherman lelt Vicksburg the 1st of
February, at the head of thirty-five thousand
infautry, two or three thousand cavalry, and
from sixty to eighty pieces of artillery Al
most simultaneously Grierson or Smith began
their inarch through North Mississippi with
twelve or fifteen thousand cavalry and moun
ted infrantry. Mobile, at the same time, was
! threatened by water with the enemy s fleet of
CtinDoaW. aud l.y lanu irom reusucuiu .u

The question naturally arose with those
anxious almut the fate of this section, what
was to be the result ? General Polk had re
Vently been placed iu command of this Depart
merit. He assumed command Ute in Decern
ber and -scarcely bad more than C mdiarized
hiniself with ths command, and had but little
time to organize his troops nd rol'oct to ' th

raphlly and vigorously on to J.i-ksoii, and
from tnat point they threatened Meridian, the

garrison two or three brigade's to retard the
XViir
With the additional force from Mobile the I
enemy was checked, enabling him to save his
accumulated stores and protect his supplies.
The little army ot this. Department fell back
from Brandon in perfict order slowly and
successsuliy. The enemy moved his bodies of
infantry, artillery and cavalry, with caution
and t rude.nce. Lee fiung upon his flanks and
compelled him to move in compact column,
giving him no time to forage or lep;d;te
upon the country, tn the meantime General
Polk, with all his avknowledgcd energy, was
moving iid his st.ires from points of the differ

The Major General commanding congratu
lates the troops upon tneir complete iy hui-uw
ful defence of the city of Richmond, rmi its
rescue from the ravages of the invader.
The enemy was gallantly r -pulsed on the
north side by Colonel Stevens' command, and
the wet bv Brig. Gen. G. V. C. Lee's troops.
Their conduct is entitled to the highest praise
aud credit.
To Colonel Bradley T. Johnson, and the
officers and soldiers under his command, the
thinks of the Major General are especially
due, for the prompt and vigorous manner in
, . , , nursned the enemv from Beever
t) ' Richmond, and thence to the Famon-
I ' . , .
kv and down the Peninsula, making repeated
mm j '
charges, capturing many prisoners and hor
ses, and thwarting any attempt oi mecu-
tmv to charge them.
The Major General commanding begs iea e
to tender to Major General Hampton and his
command, bis sincere thanfcs for tneir co-op-eiation
in following up the enemy, and their
gallant assault upon his camp at Atlee's Sta
tion, on Tuesday night, in which the enemy's
entire force was stampeded, and completely
routed, leaviwg in the hands of General Hamp
ton many prisoners and horses.
Lastly, the conduct of the Home Guanl of
King and Queen' countv, and of Captain
McGruder's equadron of the 42d Bittalion
Virginia Cavalry, who, in conjunction with
small detachments of furloughed men, under
Captain Fox and Lieutenant Pollard, of the
Cavalry of die A. N. V., attacked the retreat
ing columns of Col. Dahlgreea killing the
loader and canturinc nearly one hundred pri
soners, with neeroes ind horses deserves
acknowledgment.
