their teams chosen, and difficult drills
and intricate evolutions have been for
a long time the order of the day.
Of those which will participate in the
exhibition probably the most favored
is the composite troop of the Second
cavalry, which has been . exercising
here. This is not the only division of
the Second cavalry being prepared for
the tournament, but it is the one that
has attracted the greatest attention,
owing largely to the fact that it is lo
cated so near Washington. The com
posite troop has for its commander
Captain Lloyd M. Brett. a veteran who
is recognised as one of the best caval
ry officers in the service. The troop it
self is made up of detail from Troops
3, H, G and B and will be divided into
two sections.
The first section wit be fully
equipped, but the second will dispense
with saddles and use blanket and sur
dug.e instead; hence it will be known
as the bareback sectlon. The first will
.perform the evolutions provided in the
regulations to* mounted troops, while

MOVING PICTURE TRICKS.
How the fliograph I. Made to Show
Seemingly Impossible Things.
The biograph, having depicted most
things in the world of fact, has now
found now rcalmtis to conquer in tiction.
It has Iecoime a juggler, or. as it
might prefer to en lI itself, an -illusion
ist." and the uncanny feats it perioruIns

make a wager on the cause of tie (iS
pute. Then each takes fronm his waist
coat pocket a tiny doll dressed like a
boxer ready for a lhaipionship nmatcll.
The dolls are placed on the table, im
mediately "coie to life" and comimence
spurring in the most scientific manner.
The two Gullivers applaud the lillipu
tian pugilists as they tight vigorousy
in a space that might be covered with
a dinner plate, and when at last a live
grain glove inflicts the "knockout"
blow on a head that is smaller than an
early green pea the conqueror and the
conquered are picked up and ignomini
ously replaced in the waistcoat pockets
of their owners.
This clever effect, the manager of
the biograph company explained, is ob
tained by superimposing two films
which are exposed separately. First
the two men seated at the table act
their part of the performance in front
of the camera, and then another blo
graph photograph Is taken of a boxing
match, and the two rolls of films are
then skillfully placed together. The
difference in the size of the boxers and
the onlookers is accounted for by the
fact that the latter are placed much
nearer to the camera than the former.
But even more startling illusions
than this can be produced. For in
stance, the biograph throws upon the
screen a picture of a headless man
standing by a huge egg, from which
one might expect a healthy young
rooster to emerge. The decapitated
man cracks the egg with a mallet and
discloses his missing head inside.
The face smiles recognition and al
lows the hands to take a few hundred
ordinary sized eggs from its mouth,
for no particular reason except to
show that it is capable of further mira
cles. Then it looks longingly toward
the neck and shoulders from which it
has been exiled and is finally lifted into
its place. The complete man then bows
to the audience and dlsappsars. It
spoils a good illuskon to describe too
fully its inner mysteries, but it may
be hinted that this effect' is obtained
by the Judicious use of black velvet
Curtains. Bland velvet, in fact, is the
material feom which the modern bio
graph magician shapes his "invisible
cloak," and the garment is quite as ef
tective as the one the prince in An
dersen's fairy tale wore when he set
out to discover the wicked doing of the
witch.-London Mail.
Uapertene. of Drowning.
We have not for a considerable time
read anything more dramatic and life
like than the paper read by Dr. Low
son on this topic. Death by drowning
has usually been described as a pain
less and even a pleasant one, but Dr.
Lowson is able to contradict this. In
the early stage the most striking thing
was intense, intolerable pain in the
"It seemed as if one were in a
Vee which was gradually being screw
ed up tight until it felt as if the ster
num and spinal column must break."
At this point the author had time to re
feet on how far wrong his old teacher,
Sir Henry Littlejohn, had been when
dsedbrlh death by drowning as being
as pleasant as "falling about in beauti
tal green fields in summer." Gradual
ly, however, after several abortive,
gulping eforts to inspire, as the car
boaic acid in the blood began to in
erease, the pain began to lessen, and
the mental eandition became that of
one In a pleasant dream, and, like a
vivid dream, the author still retains
memory of the clearness with which
his view of the native "hills at home"
fashed across his mind.. Before con
selousness disappeared the sensations
were positively pleasant. Dr. Lowson
does not think that while consciousness
lasts it is posesibla for any water to en

deal is swallowed. - London Medical

T. De Witt Talmage, is more satisfied

preachers, must answer at least once
in his life certain stock questions.
Among these questions are the "evolu

The question, propounded at a liter
ary society composed of embryo ors
tors and .statesmen, was as follows:
'.Mr. Talmage, do you believe that the
whale swallowed Jonah?" Without a

"What p You have I have. Why

and you disbelieve I cannot say. in

chased several ai'ticles wliiili will add
interest to the exhibit of his duirlrt
ment at the Louisiana 1'trcliase expo
sition. Conspicuous 1tanog thiese is a
bronze medallion bearing tie heads of
Napoleon 1. and Marie Louise, struck
off by order of the emperor to com
memorate the Louisiana purchase. Un
derneath the two finely executed heads
is an American eagle under an anureole
of stars. Surrounding the medallion is
a scroll emblazoned with emblems
typifying the amity which existed be
tween France and America. The
whole is Inclosed in an old gold frame
which dates back to the days of the
empire. It was the property of one of
Napoleon's generals, and Major
Michael got it direct from the grand
daughter of the original owner, to
whom it descended.
The medallion and its symbols re
call the fact that Napoleon once had
a strong following in the section in
cluded In the Louisiana purchase ter
ritory and in Canada and that great
sympathy was felt for him when he
was banished to St. Helena. This
sympathy found frequent expression In
the newspapers, songs and poems of
that epoch.
The most substantial movement in
his favor started In New Orleans and
extended to St. Louis and Canada. The
originator of it was M. Girot, a
wealthy citizen of New Orleans. His
lieutenant was M. Peugney of St.
Iauls, an ex-officer in Napoleon's ar
my, who had won the cross of the
Legion of Honor and who was a near
kinsman of the Count de Montholon,
who shared Napoleon's exile in St.
Helena.
M. Girot furnished the money and
M. Peugney the naval and military
experience to fit up a vessel, manned
by sailors and soldiers who had been
carefully drilled In the suburbs of
New Orleans to climb bock escarp
ments. The vessel was ready to sall
when the news of Napoleon's death
reached MM. Girot and Peugney. The
object of the expedition was to forci
bly rescue Napoleon from his island
prison and bring him to New Orleans.
They wer. so confident of his rescue
that M. Girot built and furnished an
elegant home for Napoleon's occupancy
on Rue St. Louis In New Orleans. Ts..s
house was an object of interest tot
generations in New Orleans, and its lo
cation can still be pointed out. the
grandsons of M. Peugney, now promi
nent citizens of St. Louis, possess a
chket of documents and Napoleonic
souvenirs that would prove invaluable
additions to any Napoleonic museum.
These documents have never been
translated. It is said that some of
these came from St. Helena after Na
poleon's death.
Racaniv .I. wo m-- enealne the nen._
Recently I was discussing the pro
posed Girot expedition with a United
States consul stationed in Canada. He
knew the story and promised to send
me further proofs of It from the fam
ily of a distinguished French refugee
who also had many manuscript papers
bearing on the same subject as well as
documents showing that many French
Canadians contributed money and men
to M.( Girot's expedition.
Another curiosity Major Michael has
parphased is the lapel of a coat which
gives one an Idea of the gorgeous uni
form once worn by our diplomatic and
consular officers. This lapel Is of blue
broadcloth covered with acorns and
oak leaves embroidered with gold
thread.
It has a history. A Virginian was
sent to the court at Versailles as Amer
ican minister. Secretary of State Liv
ingston had prescribed a regulation
uniform, the official plans of which
will be on exhibition at St. Louis. The
official tailor was a Mr. Loudoun, from
Virginia, whose shop was opposite the
United States treasury in Washington.
The new minister, a gay young bach
elor, ordered the uniform and started
for his post, where he appeared, ac
cording to Livingston's requirements,
resplendent in knee breeches, gold buc
kles, short sword, cocked hat and a
coat of blue broadcloth elaborately
embroidered in gold braid.
He remained in France a year or
two, came back to Washington, met,
fell in love with and married a Vir
ginia girl. He was, hard up for funds,
so he left his costly diplomatic coat in
Mr. Loudoun's hands as security for
the dreas suit in which he was mar
ried. In the meantime the adminis
tration changed, and William L. Mar
cy, the new secretary of state, being
very democratic, abolished the diplo
matic and consular uniform.
The minister had no further use for
the gold embroidered coat,-so be went
O1 without redeeming it, and Mr. Lou.
doun had to remove and sell the gold
braid to reimburse him for the dress
sait. The lapel was kept as a souvenir
of the Incident.
Mr. Michael heard of it and secured
It for his department at the coming
worlds fair, where many Americans
as well as Eiuropeans will be surprised
to ** that the United States did not

tulle, lace, nigrets. plumes and blos
soms without number form the hodies
of the hats. The crowns are wide and
mostly rather flat, while the brims are
everything that mind can conceive.
One lovely and poetic hat was as flat
as a pancake and made of row after.
row of tender green chiffon folds. The
brim was laid in several folds, so that
it was quite thick. Under it was a lay
er of handsome heavy lace through,
whose meshes the faint green showed

delicately. On the left side under the t
brim there was one shriveled white
rose, with brown and wrinkled foliage.
On the place where the crown would
be, supposing there was a crown, was
a fine white aigret held by a twisted
dark green velvet knot and so placed
that it almost lay down. The feathery
part was turned to the front. Many
algrets are seen, and all are set for
ward in the same way and held by
some kind of ornament in that posi
tlo.
I noticed one queerly shaped hat. It
wat part turban, but with the brim
made to stand out straight on the right
side and front, while the rest was high'
brimmed. The whole hat was made
of braid an inch wide in black and
white woven so that the black and
white formed a plaid. There was a lit
tle chiffon drawn around the crown,
and almost in front was an all black
algret held by a rich silver and jet
arrow. One striking hat was made of
plain roughish straw in a beige shade.
It was slightly dipped in front, while
the whole thing was covered with ge
raniums in scarlet and pink, their vel
vety petals covering the whole with
out any foliage.
On the other band, there are thou
sands of hats with more foliage than
flowers, as nature produces them-vio
lets, lilacs, myosotia, syringia, with
white blossoms and masses of the
beautiful green leaves; dogwood, flag
lilies, orchids, hydrangeas, roses, hi
biscus, lilies of the valley and roses of
every known kind. And this by no
means exhausts the list.
In the makeup hats-for there are;
many that are for sale ready to trim
there was one exquisite thing for a
young woman. The flat itself was of
pale blue chiffon laid in flat folds and
without a croyn. When these is no
crown, there is a bandeau beneath the
hat which serves to hold it on the bead.
Over the chiffon was laid a piece of
heavy white lace, and above that, Ilke
a wreath, lay pink crush roses, with?
just a couple of leaves. Beneath the
left side of the brim there were some
more roses and across the back, partly
falling on the hair, a whole big bunch
of buds scarcely showing the pink, so
small they were intended to appear.
A fiat hat of white chiffon had a
wreath of delicately tinted hydrangea
all around the brim and a flat looped
bow of ribbon to match hanging at the
back. Another striking confection was
of all white chiffon and loulsine ribbon.
with a big rose spray, with lots of foli
age, one jack rose and one bud. The
ribbon was brought all around the
brim exactly on the edge in a series of
puffs and loops, with a large bow at
the back where the ribbon falls to the
shoulders. A very dainty pale blue
chiffon is laid in rather loose folds on
brim and crown. Lying flat on the
brim and beneath it are bunches of
syringla. It is very pleasing. The
same scheme was carried out in black.
Black and white are quite as well liked.
for small hats as last season. A flat
hat of black mohair has a drapery of
white tulle around the brim, and nes
tled in this is a wreath of lilies of the
valley, with many leaves.
Turbans, fiats and tricornes and many
shapes adapted for the showy picture
hats are seen, but the turbans- are
