To the Editor of The Gasette:
Rumors having been circulated
' in this parish to the effect that Mr. b
-Julian Mouton, our representative, Si
ad at the last session of the Legis- ii
lature, voted for a law or had suc- f
.,,-eeded in passing a law requiring
a man should know how to o
S-and write to be able to vote,
":adwhich rumors I was convinced P
we_ re &lse, I therefore wrote to Hon e
C. W~E lam, representative from b
hIe~ pari& of -DeSota, for a state- c
eaient showing the position taken by c
Mr. Julian Mouton on the suffrage r
question, and I received a letter f
from Hon. C. W. El'am in answer f
to mine, showing the absolute fal
sity of these rumors against Mr. 6
Julian Mouton, which I herewith c
transmit to you for publication. I

MAssmas, La., Jan 14, '96.
Mr. J. O. Lelanc, Llsfayette. La.:
DEAR Sun:-I am in receipt of t
your letter of the 13th instant, in r
which you ask what was Mr. Julien 1
Mouton's course in regard to quali- 1
-fcation of the suffrage, as a mem
ber of the House of Representatives
during the session of 1894.
It happens that my recollection t
as to the course of Mr. Mouton on
the subject inquired about is distinct;
M~for Mr. Mouton was a member of I
'~the- judiciary committee with me,
and, moreover, was so able and
-ctive that he was from the start t
- ',se of the most conspicuous mem
*+ers of the House.
<: There were two bills introduced
:Lin the House bearing upon the suf
"frage, ist, The Constitutional
r mendment proper, and and, Be
noit's Austrahian Ballot bill
T. he constitutional amendmeat, as
.hiially submitted to the people by
h·t.Legislature, is familiar to every
i-le. It is now before the people of
t he State for adoption or rejection
a,i they see proper, and every quali
S~l voter has a voice in the decis
.jTnof the matter. My recollection 1
-~M~t the vote of the House on the
- of the submission of the
+amedmentwas 74 for and 9 against.
:Sthink this statement will be veri
i' et b y reference to the journal of
b: e House, a copy of which I do
:- _hapqpen to have at hand at this
.i-"Moton voted to submit the
entto the people. I talked
hbim about the matter more
once and I. remember that his

and I were members, and which
fore the cotomittee for cosidera- m
ation there wer prsent itme
bers and the acting chairmane-,
Mr. Mouton and I among them. di
Mr. Mouton was opposed to a fa- di
vorable report of thebiftl and made 01
an elaborate and exhaustive arg-and w
ment against .it on the grounds,
mainly, tWhen the bill would op bate
an educational qualification, and
would disfranchise 40 per cent of tI
fthe best citizens of his parish andder
section of the State, who, without
any fault of their own, had been de
prived of the advantages of an edu
cation. He argued furtheI amohat the
Mr. Mouton was. opposed to a fa- di
passagble of such a bill would be e- c
mentliarly njust at hat ouun ndse, be
icause it would deprive ahoperate sad,
4o per cent of the best citiens ofrish and
his parish and section of the Stte, who wiState b
of the power to vote on the consti- w
tutional amendments as to suheffrage,
which would possibly be submitted ~
to the people in the best ition of Aprilns ofi
1896, and gwould Ice it in the
power of a select few in the State to
deprive the people of their dearest.
rights, without their being able to
cast a dissenting vote.
Mr. Mouton argued the injustice
of the bill with g eat force and
earnestness, and gave the committee
to understand that he would not
consider himself bound by the ac
tion of the committee if the bill was
reported favorably, but would make
the same fight against the bill before
the House that he was making before
the committee, and wougave the do all mmittee
could to defeat it.
When a vote was had in the com
tion of ti committee it was found that 4 members
had voted for a favorable report of
the bill and 4 against; and the act
ing chairman on the committee de
ded the question by voting the com a
favorable report. So the bill came b
to the House on a favorable report' L
of the judiciary committee.
After the bill was so favorably re
posted, Mr. Mouton and some one
else got up a petition among the
members of the House to have the
bill re-teferred to the full judiciary
committee, as only i bare majority ti
of the committee had voted on the
report. The bill. was so re-r ferred,
and upon reconsideration was un
favorably reported, and nothing
further was done with it.
I have written to you thus fully d
because I think it my duty when
called upon to testify the truth as to
Mr. Mouton's course in the Legisla
tuire wijh reference to the .: atter in
quired about; it is due to him and h
to the people of the parish whom he d
represented that the truth should be t
known as to his record on this pub
lic matter.
As members of the same commit- I
tee Mr. Mouton and I were necessa- t
rily much thrown together, and fre- t
quently exchanged views on pending
legislation, both in and out of the
committee-room and House; and t
moreover, as I have said before, t
Mr. Mouton was very'able and ac- v
tive and impressed his opinions up
on members of the House with a
force that always left a distinct im
pression, whether the auditor agreed I
with him or not. I
I cannot see how any one opposed a
to the qualification of the suffrage
can find any fault with the course of
Mr. Mouton. Yours truly,
C- W. ELAM,
Member House Representautives from I t
S)eSoto Parish.
HISTORY OF0 THE " PEO

SOn the second day of September,
1895, a limited number of men met
Sat Falk's hall and resoluted, where
ased and turned loose a considera
ble amount of wrath and several
Sbushels of torbid eloquence. The
e object of that meeting was ostensi
a bly the defeat of Sheriff Broussard.
Democrats were denied admission
4 because they were friends of Mr.
o Broussard. At this meeting the
s Advertiser was made the official or
gan of the organiz.tion, which was
C called the Anti-Administration Com
mittee.
is On Deoa z4 the committee met in
-Mr. Campbell's office and elected
d thie following officers: P.B. Roy,
d chairman; Ben Avant, vice-presi
. dent; D. A. Cochrane, secretary.

it and adopted the following, which

Omer itou a d, the regular nomi. It
nee of the D: emocratic.party,. pos fre
sesses tqalteli which will make hlim lu
a go-seful member of the Gen

organisation; I believe in party ha
nominations; I believe in sticking to St
party nomin-e-s; I believe that a on
Democrat is in duty bound to vote tic
for -candidates nominated by the tel
party. Lqquestion no man's Democ- It
racy. I have no right to judge oth- ad
er people. I speak and vote ac- in;
cording to my own conception of to
what- constitutes Democracy. and
party fealty and chegftilly accord th
to others the same privileges which at
I claim for myself. Experience St
teaches us -that the supremacy of the in
Democratic arty is necessary to the as
welfare of the country. The social so
and political well-being of the peo- tu
ple depends upon the continuance kr
in power of that party, and ex- m
perience teaches us also that through at
party organization alone can.this be ntc
effected. The Democratic party le
has saved this State from a fate too ed
horrible to describe. What has been of
done, was possible only through th
party organization. Break up party v(
organ zation and we go back to w
the dark and troublous times re
of the past. The only way to beat v4
the Republicans is to be united and m
the only way to be united is to stick tl
to the party organization. That is he
as clear as the noonday sun. It is ol
for these reasons that I am a party
map, and being a party man, the n
first adforemost reason why I pro- b
pose to vote for Hon. J. Omer sl
Broussard is because he is the-un- tl
disputed nom. nee of the Depmocratic t
t party of Lafayette parish, as ex- tl
pressed by over one thousand white a
Democratic voters on the 14th day ti
of December, 1895. Other reasons n
why I will vote tor Mr. Broussard
need not be given. Had he been e
unworthy of representing this parish #
Sin the Legislature he would not have sa
received the o1032 votes which were d
Scast for him. He who is good a
enough for the Democratic party of t
this parish is good enough for me.
t I am no better than my party. If a
there is any difference, it's on the c
s other side-the party is better.. I h
will vote for Omer Broussard for n
the same reasons that impel me, as tl
ta Democrat, to vote for Murphy a
- Foster for governor and for Snyder 1l
for lieutenant-governor. VOTER. e
A mass meeting was held at the
court-house in St. Martinville Sun- c
day "to devise ways and means of n
carrying into successful execution a
e plan for the settling and develop
- ment of the vacant lands in this par
t ish." If the people of St. Martin c
parish wish to secure a desirable t
class of immigration, about the first 1
thing they will have to do is to hold
e their mass meetings, horse races,
etc., on some other day than Sun- a
s day. Good peo:Ile do not care to a

Bro. Goulsby, the gentlemen who
a held the meeting at St. Martinville
e on a Sunday differ with you. That
n is all. They see no harm in meet- I
ts ing on Sunday and you do. They
have the right to meet as much
as they see fit and you have the
Srigt.t to keep the Sabbath in the
Sway you deem best. Desirable im
r migrants, or ",good people," as y6u
' call them, seek a country inhabited
Sby liberal-minded people and not
by those who believe in the blue
aslaws. Be. a little more tolerant,

It is a pity that they are not more

made.
-Under the present constitution a
foreigner over-sx years of age who
has lived in- the ward, pauish` and
State during the specified time has
only to make a declaration of inten
tion to become a citizen of tie Uni
tedjStates to be entitled to vote.
If the proposed amendment is
adopted in -net April at all follow
ing elections- a foreigner will have
to be naturalized in order to vote. P
I-If the amendment is adopted by
the people a man will have to be
able to read the constitution of the
State in his mother tongue, that is
in any one language, or, he shall be
assessed in property, real or per
sonal, at $zoo. Hence, the consti- 0
tution will have to be printed in every
known living language, so that a
man who reads any language will be
able to vote. But, if a man can
not read and does not know the first
letter of the alphabet, but iassess- w
ed at $Soo in property, immovable w
or movable, located anywhere in
the State, he will have the right to
vote. Anyone who will own $200oo
worth of property, whether he can
read or not, will have the right to
vote. -The $soo worth of property
may consist of land, buildings, cat
tle, fences, household furniture,
horses, farming implements or any i
other kind of property.
Section 6th of the amendmend
ment reads: "The General assem
bly at its regular session of 1896,
r shall have the power by vote of two
thirds of all the members elected
r to each House, and approved by
the governor, to modify, change or
i amend this article of the Constitu
r tion," without it being again sub
s mitted to the popular vote.
1 It must be borne in mind, how
1 ever, that this amendment is not law -
n pt present, because the matter is
e submitted to the whole people for
e decision, either for or against. It
I will not be a law unless they, want it
f to become a law.
At the next election every man
f will be entitled to vote whether he
e can or can not reac, and whether
I he owns property or not. The ru
r mors which have been circulated in
s this parish that a man would not be
y able to vote at the next election un
r less he could read or owned prop
erty are not true.
