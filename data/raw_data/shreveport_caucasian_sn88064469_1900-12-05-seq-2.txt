.THE SHIP SUBSIDY SCHEME.
What is Hanna's ship subsidy bill ?
It is simply a scheme through which to
steal under the guise of law between
200,000,000 and $800,000,000 from
the people of the United States for
the benefit of privileged ship owners
who are engaged in the carrying
trade and for business on their own
account, but who cannot or will not
compete with English ships in the
transportation of freights, etc. The
Hanna ship subsidy is one of the
schemes which received the indorse
ment of the people and Hanna,
therefore, has the right to demand
and to insist on the steal being legal
ized by Congress. The scheme has
already the assurance of approval by
McKinley when it shall have been
passed by Congress. It is too late to
sq eal. Now give up the pound of
flesh to Haunaistm, together with the
blood, beart, bones and all thrown in
for good measure.

The City Connell wili convene to
morrow night, in regular session,
when the question of license for rev
anue will be considered. The bone
of contention Is the saloon license, as
it Is called, and there are councilmen
who favor the increase of the license
to one thousand dollars, which would
be prohibitory or would limit the
business to a few, perhaps ten; there
are couneilmen who believe that a
license flxed at five hundred dollars
would relieve the community of ".he

moral tone, while other counelilm ,
are Inclined to a licease of (260 and
