OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
A letter just received from Miss
Mary Lindsey, Forsyth, Ga., might
possibly have won the first prize in
our contest to correct Mary Stanley’s
letter, but it came too late. There is a
suggestion that Miss Lindsey, who
does not say how old she is, might
have received some help from her
teacher. She says “She (Mary
Stanley) violates the rule of coher
ence in talking of herself, then the
farm, then the paper, and then back
to self.’’ It strikes Daddy Jim that
both reasoning and sentence are
rather .academic. If he is mistaken
in this, he will apologize; but he
wants to say, anyhow, that this page
is not for teachers and parents, but
for the kids. Let the children write
in their own way, mistakes,
scratches, blots and all. We want
the real boy and the real girl; not
an automaton of the schools, or the
mouthpiece of a fond mother. We
want to know what you are think
of and hoping for, little man <and
little woman, and you must tell us
in your own fashion, without help
or advice from any one. That is the
only way to learn to write.
GLAD TO GO TO SCHOOL.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come,
the second time. Our school will
start about the first of January, and
I will be glad, for I’ll be in the fifth
grade. Daddy Jim, I have a strange
story to tell, but it is true. Did any
of you cousins ever see a snake
catch a hawk? My papa and my
uncle were going along the road, and
they saw a hawk lying on the
ground. My uncle got out of the
buggy and picked it up, and a black
snake had caught it and choked it,
and had eaten its tongue out. It’s
strange, but it’s true. I can’t write
much now; I have a little headache.
Love to all.—Your friend, Sadie
Robbins, Sylvania, Ga.
PLEASED WITH POST-CARDS.
Hello, Daddy Jim! I received my
post-cards, and was very much pleas
ed with them. Many thanks for
them. Our school has started today,
and I sure am glad. I like to go to
school. My teacher’s name is Mr.
Grover Bailey, and I like him. I
will close for this time.—Lura Fields,
R. F. D. 1, Flippen, Ga.
THE HAPPIEST LIFE.
Here I come once more. I have writ
ten once before, but I thought a let
ter from the dear old State of Geor
gia would help the Post-Card Club
a great deal. I live the happiest life
in the country, twelve miles from
Macon; but my postoffice is at Lo
raine. I go to school at Macon, be
cause I am too far from any high
school in the country. I am in the
senior grade. lam going to school to
be a competent school teacher some
day. How long I will have to wait!
If I graduate, I will be only fifteen.
Hello! all members of the Post-Card
Club, send me a post-oard on the
twentieth of November, for that will
be my birthday. I will appreciate
them greatly, and I will answer all
on the day received. Wishing this
letter fair success, I will ring off.—
Lois Brown, Loraine Ga.

A LITTLE TEXAS GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I have the
whooping cough. We have planted
again. I told you that 1 had two
doves. The cat got one and tore one
leg off, and I felt so sorry for the
other 1 let it go. We have some
chickens, Buff Cochin and Partridge
Cochin. But we are going to try
Minorcas and Buff Orpingtons. My
school has started. I can’t go to
school until I get well, but I study
at home. We have a big yard and
play keeping house. We are all
proud to see our letters in The Jef
fersonian. My little brother is six
years old. I love him very much.
He knows his A B C’s, and can read
and spell. My aunt sent my sisters
and brother and me a box full of
toys, four dolls and two little birds,
and lots of candy. We have another
little calf. One night his mother
came up and left him in the woods,
and it came up. I play at home with
my black kitten. My brother has a
black dog. He is the best dog you
ever have seen. Goodby to Daddy
Jim. —Lena Adams, Harlingen, Tex.
OUR TEXAS FRIENDS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—We have school
now. My teacher’s name is Miss Lil
lian Weems. I live two miles from
school. We had to build a new
schoolhouse, the house we used last
year was sold. We have eleven lit
tle calves. We get all the milk and
butter we can use. My grandpa
reads your paper and likes it very
much. I like to rea dthe letters
from boys and girls. I am in the
fourth grade. I fell the other day
and sprained my arm very badly.—
Your little friend, Lizzie Adams. Har
lingen, Tex.
KATIE’S PETS.
I will write a few words to The
Jeffersonian, as I have never written
before. I am a little country girl.
I live eight miles from town on a
farm. I have four brothers and one
sister. I have a lot of pets. I have
a cow and a calf and one puppy and
three cats. Papa takes your paper
and I like it fine. I like the Post-
Card Club fine. Well, I guess I had
better close with a riddle:
As I went through the garden gap,
Whom should I meet but Dick Red
Cap.
A stick in his hand, a stone in his
throat,
If you guess this riddle I will give
you a groat.
I will stop for this time. I hope
to see this in print.—Your little
friend, Katie McDade, Geneva, Ala.

Nervous
Prostration
For Three Years
"Dr. Miles’ Restorative Nerv
ine cured me of a period of
nervous prostration of over three
years duration, and the Anti-
Pain Pills are as necessary to
us as the roof of our house.
They have been household rem
edies with us for many years.”
WM. J. LOUGHRAN,
1214 Catherine St.,
Philadelphia, Penna.
Much sickness is due to nerv
ous troubles. Headache, diz
ziness, epilepsy and insanity are
nervous troubles. Then there
is a large class of disorders
which arise from a weakness of
the nerves of an organ or part,
as weak lungs, heart, stomach,
kidney, bladder, eyes, etc.
Dyspepsia and indigestion are
usually the result of nervous
disorders.
Restorative Nervine
soothes the irritated nerves, and
assists the nerve cells to gener
ate nerve force.
Dr. Miles’ Nervine is sold by ail drug
gists. If the first bottle fails to benefit,
your druggist will return your money.
