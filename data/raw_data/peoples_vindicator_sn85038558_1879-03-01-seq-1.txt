THE CENUINK
DR. C. oLANE'S
.. CELEIBRATED
LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OF
$ppattisi, or Liver Complant,
DosPPMIA AND SICK iADiACis.
* 'F-4~--
Symptoma i'of a Dimeased Liver.
P)AIN in the right side, under the
1 edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side;.sometimes the pain
is felt underithe shoukler blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes.mistaken
for rheumatisn in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive sometimcs alternative with,
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The piesit complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are c61d or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation lof the
skin; his spints are low; and'although
.he is satisfied that exercise wquld be
beheficial to him, yet'he can scarcely
summon u fortitude enopgh to try it.
lh fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attenda
the disease, but cases have occurted
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
DR C. MCLANE's LIVER PILLS, IIj
CASES OF AGcvE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
.cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or. after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.
$EWAmE 1 IoU'arr age .
The genuine are never sugar coated.
Every box has a red wax seal on the
lid, witllh the impression Dx. MCLANI's
LIVt'a PILLS.
The genuine McLANR's Ltva PILLS
bear the signatures of C. MCLANs and
FLRMING BIOS. on the wrappers.
Insist upon having the genuine DR.
C. McLANs's LIVR PILLs, prepared by
Fleming Bros., of Pittsburgh, Pa., the
market beag full of imittlos*of the
name McLane, spelled dleemntly but
same pronunciation.
