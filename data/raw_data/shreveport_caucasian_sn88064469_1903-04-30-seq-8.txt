of New York, April ').-Leopold Wer
theimer, a wealthy dry goods merchant,
is was shot three times its his home in
er West One Hundred and Fifteenth
street. He was wounded in the chest,
er arm and right side, and is in a serious
condition. Charged with the shooting.
the police arrested Joseph Simpson,
thirty years old; of East One Hundred
and Twenty-fist street. The injured
man is thirty-two years old and a
member of the firm of Aaron & Wer
theimer, dry goods merchants, who
were recently burned out at their place
of business in Third avenue. Simp
son, the police say, was employed there
as a watchman prior to the fire. At
the time of the fire two persons were
- burned to death.
s The motive for the shooting is a
mystery both to the police and the
Wertheimer family, and campson, who
Y was very cool when arrested, refused
r to make any statement. Since the fire
Wertheimer has not been engaged in
any business. The firm discharged its
enWipoyes, including Simpson, biut he
e got work as a motorman. A week ago
f he lost that position and he had a long
talk with Mr. Wertheimer Monday af
ternoon and returned that night. He
again talked with Mr. Wertheimer and
the family thinks Simpson demanded
money. He returned to the ýs ertheimer
home at an early hour to-day and
the shooting occurred in the hallway
of the house, after which Simpson
went away and later was arrested.'
