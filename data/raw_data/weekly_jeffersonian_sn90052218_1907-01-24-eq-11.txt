TEDERAL OWNERSHIP IN MEXICO.
So Completely successful has a four
years’ experiment in federal owner
ship and operation of railroads proved
in Mexico that the government, ac
cording to Ygnacio Sepulveda, ore ->f
the most prominent and influential at
torneys of Mexico City, who is at
the Hotel Astor, is about to acquire
the Mexican Central Railroad, the
second most important line in tjhat
that company.
Four years ago the Mexican gov
ernment took over a majority of the
stock of the National Railroad or
Mexico, which has 1,000 miles o p
tracks, and covers the territory be
tween Mexico Citv and Laredo, Tex.,
and extends south to the state of
Michoacan. Federal ownership and
operation of this road has been suc
cessful in every particular.
The Central Railroad was about to
fall into the hands of American capi
talists. President Diaz, to prevent
such a deal, which, he feared, would
result in the introduction of Ameri
can trust and monopolistic methods
into Mexico, opened negotiations with
those controlling the enterprise with
the result that terms have been agreed
noon, and only the ratification of the
Mexican congress is needed to ce
ment the bargain.
Is Native of California.
Mr. Sepulveda, who is a native of
California, having served fifteen years
on the bench at Los Angeles, is
here to spend the holidays with his
wife and daughter. To an Amer
ican reporter last night he said:
“Federal ownership of railroads
has had an eminently satisfactory
test of four years in Mexico. During
that period the government has own
ed and operated the National Rail
road of Mexico, and the treatment it
has accorded to both patrons and em
ployes has met with universal ap
proval and commendation. Within
the last couple of weeks President
Diaz, who was the moving spirit in
the first effort towards government
ownership, has closed a deal whereby
the government will take over a con
trolling interest of the Mexican Cen
tral Railroad, which is the second
railroad of importance in the coun
try.
“The government does not make
public the terms of these transac
tions, but I understand it merely as
sumes a majority of the stock, and
permits the other stockholders to re
tain their interest and enjoy div
idends. The Central Railroad has not
been on a paying basis, I believe, but
it is safe to say it will be placed
there by the government, as was the
National Railroad. All that is need
ed now to place the Central Railroad
in control of the government is the
approval of -the Mexican congress,
which will be given in a few days.
“The road is being taken over to
prevent it from falling into the hands
of American corporations. There
was some danger, I am informed,
that American capitalists would get
control of the road, and the Mexicans
do not relish domination by trusts
and monopolies. The people are re
joicing that the government is to be
come i f he owner of the Central.
Supervised All Railways.
“The government, and especially
President Diaz, has always exercis-
ed a kind of supervision over all
railroads. For example, such a thing
as a protracted strike, with attend
ing violence such as is not uncommon
here, would be impossible in Mex
ico.
“About three months ago there was
a strike on one of the big roads in
Mexico. The employes went out and
the road was unable to operate.
President Diaz made certain recom
mendatioi s and they were accepted
bv both sides. They resulted in cer
tain concessions being made to the
employes, and the operation of the
rai’.rccrd was immediately resumed.
“Tn my opinion President Diiaz
has no equal as a ruler. He has had
many difficulties >to encounter during
his incumbency in office, but has sur
mounted all of them. The country,
■through his efforts, is in a most pros
perous condition. The a* lion of
the government is very progressive.
The security to peisjns r.n l protection
to property, which some newspapers
seemed to doubt, are. beyond ques
tion, better than in any other coun
try in the world.
“President Diaz has managed af
fairs so well, in fact, that there is
a large surplus in the treasury. This
was shown by the last budget, after
the promulgation of which a proposi
tion was made by the government to
reduce taxes and increase the sala
ries of government employes.
“President Diaz, is a steady
thoughtful, sagacious statesman. He
is democratic, unassuming, forceful
and! tactful. The Mexican people
have the greatest regard for him.
They most sincerely hope he will live
many, many years, and continue at
the head of the government. He is
now seventv-six years old. but looks
not more than sixty-five. He is aided
by a cabinet of excellent minds.
There is progress everywhere in the
country, education is advancing and
everybody is enjoying prosperity. A
friendly and hospitable spirit exists
toward foreigners, especially Amer
icans, and much American capital
is invested in mines, lands and other
businesses.
Great New Public Works.
“The Mexican government has con
structed a number of very fine and
imposing public buildings in the city
of Mexico and elsewhere. It has now
finished a magnificent post office,
which I think will compare favorably
in beauty of architecture with any
post office building in the world.
The government is building a beauti
ful legislative hall for congress. The
work will occupy a considerable pe
riod. The foundations have just been
laid.
“Also the government has built,
within a short time, and now occu
pies a series of hospital buildings.
There is a separate building for each
of the most important diseases. The
hospitals are very well managed and
are thoroughly equipped with modern
apparatus.
“Then, too, the government has
constructed a complete public school
system. The buildings are commodi
ous and built along modem lines. I
refer to these things because they
indicate what rapid strides the Mex
ican government is making in munici
pal ownership. The government is

also paying considerable attention to
the seaports, and all of them will
soon be made available for heavy
draft vessels.
“The government has appropriated
funds and ’has started to build a na
tional theatre, and this has pleased
the people as much : s any act of the
government. It will be an ornate
structure and the Mexican people
want it to compare favorably with
any national theatre in the world.
It is the intention to give all the op
eras, and in addition there will be
other interesting features.
“Mexico is a very classical and
musical country and the Mexican
people are very appreciative of good
music. Indeed, the government bands
that play nightly in the Plaza render
the very best of music. Several of
the bands have visited the United
States and have been highly appre
ciated here.
“A department of the government
that General Diaz takes great pride
in is the army, and he has spared no
pains to improve it and place it on
a high plane. I may say that it is
now sufficient for all purposes. It is
finely equipped with the most improv
ed weapons, is magnificently officered,
and the rank and file are the pick of
the country. They make a magnifi
cent appearance when on parade.”
“Diaz Abuses No Trust.’’
“Although the powers vested in
President Diaz arc as great as could
safely be accorded to any president,
they have never been abused. In fact,
the affairs of the government have
been administered with great benefit
to the people in every particular.
To give the same power to another
man might be dangerous.
“There are mauiy Americans in
Mexico. Aside from those interested
in business there, thousands of Amer
ican visitors reach the City of Mex
ico every year. Your Mr. Hearst,
after the recent gubernatorial cam
paign in this state, visited the City
of Mexico and met President Diaz.
Tn fact, both Mr. and Mrs. Hearst
talked with President Diaz at the
American Thanksgiving ball in the
City of Mexico. They wore escorted
to the box occupied by the president,
and there Mr. Hearst and President
Diaz had a long chat. I may say
that Mr. Hearst is persona grata in
Mexico. I have a copy of Tmparcial,
the semi-official newspaper publish
ed in Mexico, which published an ar
ticle on Mr. Hearst’s arrival in the
city in which it spoke very highly
of him.”
The article in question spoke of
Mr. Hearst’s fight against trust do
mination in this country, and coupled
its eulogy of the congressman with
a general condemnation of trusts and
monopolies.
“The policy of the Mexican gov
ernment has been to encourage rail
road enterprises,” continued Mr.
Sepulveda. “Indeed, it has subsi
dized a number of railroads running
through the less populous section in
the hope of building up these regions.
The Stillwell road, running from Kan
sas to the Pacific coast, for example,
has a subsidy. The Subsidy wild
cease, of course, when the road
reaches a paying basis. The Tehuante
pec Railroad, running from the gulf
to the coast, is about completed and
will be put in operation as Soon as
the ports are finished. Th?re are
still oilier railroads in process of con
st ruction, and the country is bound
to develop very rapidly.
“By the way,” added Mr. Sepulve
da, “the Mexican government is
about to send Mr. Creel as its am
bassador to the United States. He
will be found to be an extremely
able representative. He is a thor
oughgoing business man, and is high
ly thought of in Mexico. I presume
he will take office this month.
“I neglected to say, when speaking
of the acquisition of the Central
Railroad, that there is a well-ground
ed rumor that F. N. Brown, an Amer
ican, who has been president and
manager of the National Railroad,
will probably be made president of
both roads. Ilis management of the
National has been efficient and in ev
ery way satisfactory to the govern
ment and the people.”—New York
