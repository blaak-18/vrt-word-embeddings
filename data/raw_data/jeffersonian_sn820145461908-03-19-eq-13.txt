that can compete for ocean-going freight.
At your expense, that impossibility is
to be abolished. The difference in price
between the cheap foreign-built ship and
the dear home-built ship is to be made up
out of your money.
At your expense, the Trust will there
fore be able to compete for the ocean
business.
At your expense, the Trusts themselves
will scoop the Carriers’ profit upon the
transportation of the Trust made goods
which are sold abroad cheaper than they
are sold at home.
You catch it all around, don’t you, son?
We do need a Ship Subsidy—we
Trusts.
We want to maintain our monopoly
at home, and we will have it. We want
to continue to undersell the foreigner in
the foreign market, and we will "do it.
We want, furthermore, to rake into our
own coffers the profits now reaped by the
foreigner who controls ocean transporta
tion.
We could do this by lowering the
Tariff, but that would derange our entire
Class-law fabric. That would endanger
our monopoly of the home market.
Consequently, the only wav for us to
get what we want, is to have the Gov
ernment grant us a Subsidy which will
make good to us that difference in price
between home-made and foreign-made
vessels which our trust-creating tariff has
caused.
Thus we, the Privileged, will unload
upon the Unprivileged both loads —that
of the Trust, and that of our escape from
the one consequence of the trust which
hurts us.
There is only one incident to the Pro
tective system which is a drawback to
the Trusts.
That is the impossibility of controlling
ocean transportation.
Every other incident to the Protective
System helps the trusts and hurts the peo
ple.
The one incident which hurts the trusts
and helps the people must be dealt with.
We must so manage that ocean trans
portation shall likewise belong to the
Trust.
How?
By giving to the merchant marine a
sum of money out of the public treasury,
over and above the freight which is
earned.
Then, indeed, every incident of the
Protective System will present a harmon
ious color-scheme, for the trusts will
have hogged the whole business.
One never can tell what may happen,
but if Mr. Hearst has not cooked his
goose, so far as the earnest reformers are
concerned, we are much mistaken.
