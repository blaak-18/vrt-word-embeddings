THE BOATIMAN.
A maiden sits in a tiny bark,
Singing so sweetly,
The boatman be is grim and dark,
Rowed so freely.
The stream is narrow, the banks are fair;
"Rest thee, good master,"
Idle her longing, vain her pray'r,
He rows the faster.
Anon, they float on the river wide,
A mighty river,
Instead of flowers by the water-side,
Pale aspens quiver.
And lo, a woman where sat the maid
Who sang so sweetly; '
The boatman, grim and undismayed,
Still rows fleetly.
On and on, till they reach the sea
That flows for ever ;
And drift away on the ocean free,
Returning never.
And vain it is for earthly eye
To follow thither;
And vainly mortal tongue may cry,
"Gone-whither, whlither "

SMr. William O. Carpenter, a well-to

be ty twenty-mine years ago, there ap

n- what he and his physioans deoided
lei was a wen. Wnen first discovered it
if was no larger than a large-sized shot,
at and of a whitish color, resembling
somewhat a water-bllster, but of a
is hard, callous substance. This en
nd largement continued to increase in
fat site and retained its original color
he for elghteen years, when It ball at
e tatoea the size of a walnut, changed
ad its color from white to a dark pIr
Spie and became not only very trou
Sblesome but painful as well, so muoh
he so that Mr. Carpenter resolved to
have it removed, and visited a num.
st ber of phyicians with that purpose
rs In view but he could find no one wil
d ling to undertake the operation. All
et advised him against such a course,
id, giving it as their opinion that an at
to temptto remove it would place his
r life lnjeopardy. Tbissodiseounraged
Sthe sufferer that he returned to his
iF home with a determination to endure
r the paln in silence.
r* However, after this the wen in.
id creased so rapidly that th pain and
y. inconvenience it oCoosi became
Sunbearable, and finally r. Carn
-r ter, in a fit of desperation, resolved
Ii" to have it removed If it oost him his
- life. With that object in view he
m summoned a number of surgeons,
n and presented his case to them. A
Ithorough examination was then
