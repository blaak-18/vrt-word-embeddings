EXCHANGE OF BOOKS AND
PLEASANTRIES.
Dear Sir and Brother: —I see that
you have published a book titled
“Foreign Missions Exposed.” A few
months past I got the Regan Print
ing House, of Chicago, to bring out
for me the largest and most beauti
fully cloth-bound book titled “Mis
sions and Mission Methods,” your
book excepted, of course, for I have
not seen it. Brother Scarboro, of
Magnolia, Ark., said before the
Arkansas State Association that my
exposure of the Southern Baptist
Convention was the best yet brought
before the public.
I want each of us to exchange
books with the other,' then each give
such notice of the other’s book as
its merits seem to demand.
A brother has been furnishing me
with quite a number of your Maga
zines exposing Foreign Mission trick
ery. My books have sold at SI.OO
per copy so fast that the first edi
tion of one thousand is very nearly
exhausted.
I will send both this book and my
letter to Thompsonville, Ga. Just an
even exchange is all I ask.
I was in the Confederate army
four years. I have been in the min
istry forty-two years. I have been
editor of three different Baptist pa
pers.
I am called by the General Asso
ciation of Arkansas as State evan
gelist the entire incoming year.
Fraternally,
J. H. MILBURN.

Answer.
That’s all right, Brother Milburn;
you shall have my book, which is
also selling well. But I bitterly
deny that I live in Thompsonville.
My home Is Tompkins—Thomas—
Thomaston Thomasville —Tomp
kins Thomaskins Tomasville —
Thompson Thomson. Yep; that
is where I reside, when I’m
staying at home. A few post
masters, and a few of those
who work for The Jeffersonian, have
lost more or less of their minds on
account of the weird, unexpected and
almost unbelievable name of my
town. T. E. W.
BEST PAPER ON EARTH.
Dear Sir:—l have been a sub
scriber and reader of your Magazine
and Weekly nearly ever since you
quit that rotten gang in New York,
and I don’t say it to flatter you, but
you now have the best paper publish
ed on earth. Say, Tom, what has be
come of that crowd, anyhow?
I heartily endorse your articles on
Missions. I think you have nearly
killed that rotten system in this part
of Georgia. Hope you have. I be
lieve in and support Home Missions,
but I have cut the other out. Well,
you have fixed Solomon the Second
from down there at Tifton. I 'don’t
think you will hear from him any
more. I know if I was him I would
go way back and sit down. He has
found out you are a live wire and
dangerous to meddle with. A scalded
dog will bark, won’t he, Mr. Wat
son? Come again, Mr. Watson. Tear
up Jack until you have uncovered
what they have covered up. I tip
my hat to you, Mr. Watson; go on,
every God-loving, God-fearing Chris
tian is with you. Have no fears, you
and your policies will some bright
day shine as a guiding star, and your
banners will soon unfurl, revealing
to humanity a brighter and better
day. Their wails will soon be hush
ed, and then your policies will come
forth as manna from on high, and
may God hasten the day when there
will be no more Elsie Sigel cases, no
more white slave traffic, no more
selling of white women to black,
ugly negroes. God forbid that these
awful things shall exist much longer,
and hasten the day when Collier’s
Magazine shall not have a subscriber
south of Mason and Dixon’s line.
You are right, Mr. Watson. Plow
deep, and turn up to the Farmers’
Union Boodle-hunter, as you style
him, and Lee, and the other Repub
lican rascals; expose all their mid
night meetings and low-down mean
ness and save the Farmers’ Union,
the only friend the poor farmer has.
Although I am not a member of the
Union, nevertheless, I wish to see
them prosper, and give the Union
God-speed, and I hope success will
soon come their way.
Boys, make President Lee answer
Mr. Watson’s questions, or put him
out of business, as they are simple,
square questions. Every Local in the
Union should make an earnest ef
fort to get at the facts, or else your
Union will go the way of the Al
liance. Wake up, boys, don’t sleep
forever, find out the truth and sit
steady in the boat and don’t tumble
out every time some Big Ike makes
a proposition to you. The trouble
with us farmers, we don’t investi
gate these serious problems. We
plunge dead ahead into every old
thing that pops up,, and where will
we land after a while; yes, where
will we be?
Guess I had better hush up for
this time. Excuse this long letter,
Mr. Watson, and if this escapes the
waste basket I will come again. And
I beg again, Mr. Watson, go on
teaching the people some sense. We
boys are with you. Good-bye.
Yours truly,
MANNING ANDERSON.

'NEVER KNEW BEFORE WHERE
THE LITTLE MITE WENT.
Dear Tom:—Seeing and hearing so
much from different preachers from
over the country, I feel moved to
say something in your defence
I believe to take the pay or the
salaries of the ministers down to a
common level with the average la
borer, about nine-tenths of them
would be found hunting other jobs,
and his light below the top of his
head. While I have the greatest re
gard for the right kind of preachers,
my old stepfather is one of the old,
old type that has mussed out his
daily bread by the sweat of his
brow. Taking any and all who were
too poor, and without homes, he
would feed and clothe, school and
train them up to trust in his God,—'
always driving far and near to
preach the Gospel, without money or
price. What is the matter with the
kicker today is because you are en
lightening the poor and under-dog
Dfee 3effersonlatt
that never would have had a chance
to know where he was at had it not
been for you. I am ready to ac
knowledge, for one, I never knew
my little mite to Foreign Missions
went in the way it does. I do not
believe God intended for our race to
spend one cent on the heathens you
write about. Why, our own observa
tion teaches us here at home there
is no such thing as Christianizing
those Africans, and of all the sicken
ing things to behold it is a China
man. And our preachers get up in
the pulpit and bemean Tom Watson
and take on for this low type of
creatures—l do not call them human.
It makes my blood run hot. One I
K. Chambers, a M. E. preacher at my
old home church, they tell me, would
preach to his audience not to read
your literature. What kind of sound
does this have? They seem to think,
some of them, because you have been
successful and have made your mark,
and have accumulated some wealth,
you ought to give it to the four
winds. One Baptist preacher said to
me that you were a Baptist, and a
sorry one, and was grinding your po
litical axe. When he began, I told
him to go ahead, if I could not butt
him off, you could. It seems that he
had asked you for some money to
carry some boy through school, and
you refused. He is at Ailey, Georgia.
Religion at this day and time is at
a low ebb, —most of it a money mak
ing scheme, —true religion is not in
it.
Tom, the way you described buy
ing the old home back for your fath
er, and walked out of the saloon
keeper’s business, telling him he
would have to get some one else,
sounds good to me.
If you think this letter not too
pointed, or is worthy of note, you
may print it. The George A. Thomp
son, who was asking you questions
over at Swainsboro, is my cousin.
My dear old mother, whom we buried
today week, was one of the Thomp
sons, —a daughter of an old M. E.
preacher, Robert Thompson, and he
had also lived over in Screven coun
ty. My mother was the wife of
Capt. A. C. Flanders for twenty
eight years, my father being killed
at Gettysburg, Pa., when I was about
three years old.
I close with best wishes, and still
remain your friend after a lapse of
about twenty years.
Respectfully,

Dear Sir:—We wish to congratu

ENJOYS HEARING FROM OLD
FRIENDS THROUGH “LET
TERS” DEPARTMENT.
Mr. Watson:—l’m not very eager
to get my name in print, but I take
this method of showing my appre
ciation for the great work you are
accomplishing in the publication of
your Jeffersonians. Every issue of
your two publications gets stronger
and better. I enjoy reading the nice
letters from the people in the Jef

TO OUR AGENTS
We published a notice last week
that we would decline to enter
any subscription or renewal which
had been obtained for less than
our regular rates. Some of our
agents understood this to mean
that they were no longer entitled
to their commissions, and that
they must in future remit us a
full dollar for each subscription
or renewal. Let us repeat what
we said last week.
Agents and those friends who
are not working for commissions
must collect for each yearly sub
scription or renewal, one dollar;
and for each six months’ subscrip
tion, fifty cents; and for -each
three months’ subscription, twen
ty-five cents.
This does not apply to special
offers or combinations advertised
by us, or issued from our office.
Agents are entitled to their
regular commissions, just the
same as before; but those com
missions, or any part of them,
must not be given to the sub
scriber as an inducement to sub
scribe.
Subscriptions which are taken
at cut rates after the publication
of this notice will be canceled.
We are offering valuable cash
prizes to our agents. We want
them to be well paid for their
work, and we intend to protect
them in all their legitimate efforts
to obtain business.
Write to us for our agents’ let
ter for January, and LIVE UP
TO IT.

swept them off, as it has so many
of our good Populist friends. Such
a pity that these good folks have
gone off with this Socialist "dream
chasing.” As much as I detest the
two old parties, I prefer either of
them to the Socialist. The Socialist
remedy is worse than the disease.
Let every Populist get to work
during the winter months and in
crease the circulation of your publi
cations; they ought to be in every
home in the "Land.”
Merry Christmas to you and your
family, and to every good old true
Populist in all the land.

HALF MISSIONARY—HALF IN
DIAN.
Dear Sir: —Please find enclosed
my check for $2.50 to pay for both
Magazine and Weekly. I renewed
through The Missouri World before.
Am sorry that paper had to sus
pend.
I would give a ten-dollar bill to
hear you make a speech in "old
Missouri”, —in the central part,
Cooper county.
Your writings are grand— remind
me of what my old father used to
say fifty-five or sixty years ago, that
“Catholic domination was whipped
out, and would have to be again.”
It’s scandalous.
Let me tell you a little fact, on
the missionaries that I heard in"my
old birth-home —old Virginia
about sixty years ago. When an In
dian squaw was asked what her little
squaw was, she said, "Half mission
ary and half Indian.” See? Excuse
me. Yours to the end,
D. R. BRUBAKER.
