T. Capt. Pharr.
C(apt. Pharr followed Judge I
Gunby, aud the audlience sscemned
gratified wiih all that he said. lie
said that he was for free silver,
ve honest elections, and a pure State
w government; that he had always
es- stood for these ideas, and would
eg- not change his principles if elect
'yi ed; that if electedt he intended to
1, go to Baton Rouge with his asso
ciates and be inaugurated, and he
served notice, in thundering tones,
that they would not be counted out.
He said that he would be elected.
t7 Ha told the negroes that he repu
liated Kellogg and Cage, and that
no, his government will be a white
t nman's government, and advised
. them to refrain from office-seeking,
be dilligent and industrious and
ce provident, and to vote always on
a the advice of some honest, trust
p- worthy white friends.-Times
Demoerat.
ce We would like for our neighbor
ºte acros, the street, the Enterprise, to
be comment on the above.
[P
The Enterprise told us of two
a negroes on that terrible conmmit
a tee, and then when one of them
be (Blount) told said Enterprise that
of he had no notion of exterminating
18 the white people of this iparish,
msaid Enterprise, straightway lie
oe gan its rejoicing, declaring the
of country saved.
Now, we wonder what the other
darkey told said paper to secure
absolution. We have always
opined 'dat odder darkey" is on
° the s me side of the fence with I
said Enterprise, and that may be
r the reason of the complete resto- I
ration of said Enterprise's nerves i
by a statement from Blount alone. I
The Bossier Banner has ahand
re oned the campaign and gone to I

t ings, and puffing its excellent con
7 temporaries all over the Union.
t Benton is in Bossier parish. In
t the Bailey-Ogden contest, 1S94,
r" Benton polled 1300 votes in ele
i ven hours with a single and ex
t hoasted set of commissioners. At q
- 12 o'clock only 190 votes had been a
 polled. At that time A. V. Car- 1

,r them in hordes." Sixteen was a
r horde-to Carter and Bogg's com

Six hours more of dayhght was f
enough to exhaust the population i

,e The D)emocratic nominat:on in
this parish for the legislature is
tlmade to fill out the ticket. No
one expe :ted them to get elected.
1 We would have preterred to see
,t Col. U. P. Breazeale's name on I
te the ticket rather than one of the Su- c
,d pervisors of election. We feel cer
tain that Col. Brezeale would not
id have been in a position to do any i
harm. C
t It is now being announced that r
S- Secretary Carlisle will be the can
didate for the I)emocratic nomina- c
ºr tion for President, in the event of n
Cleveland's declination of the same.
-Natchitoches Enterprise. t
Neighbor, how would the nomi- t
o nation suit you ? Are your views t
t- in accord with those of tle Secre
n tary on the silver question ?
From latest accounts Foster has
not recovered from the small pox
scare, and has not been able to r
join the Foster, Kellogg and ('age
show. It is rumored that as soon
as the menagerie moves South that r
Cousin Don Caffery will join the ii
e band. t
e
n Blount's letter knocked a hole in
h Col. Porter's negro domination." e
e We presume that the Col. can now
i- hollow kinder one sided as Lewis has
a not written any letter. However, a
there is a faint rumor amonz the p
good citizens of this parish, that a
I- Lewis belongs to the Foster, Kel
o logg and Cage combine.

1. We affirm our allegiance to tl
. the pure principles of popular gov- o
ernment, as enunciated by Wash-8

t embodied in our National platform, a
i and we uphold the principle em- a
- bodied in the immortal declaration tl
that this should be "a Government tl
of the people, by the people and cl
- for the people."
2 And especially do we de
- mand the free and unlimited coin

ratio of 16 to 1, with equal debt $'
paying power as primary money,
and a full legal tender monetary I
system for the people of the Unit
od States, without consulting any
foreign nation or money syndicate. Ia

that no discrimination against our

grounds of ignorance.
