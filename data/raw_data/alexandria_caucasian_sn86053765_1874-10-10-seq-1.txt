TICKETS, TS CBNTB,
Diitftting tli« fti'Wer to one adtniiwioii to the Faire a?nl a chance in the Grand Lot
terv. In larger auiouuts, Twenty Tickets will be sold for $12,00. Fifty Tickets,
for >25 00.
Persons holding numbered coupon« have the ne chance of winning a prize in
the Lottery, as those who use their tickets fur admission to the Fair.
The Directors of the Association iu consequence of the iui|Hiverisiieil condition of
our people and the general .stringency uf the tiaies. find themselve« unable to obtain
from the or liuary method« of raising funds—means sufficient aud necessary to place
tili« iiistitutiun upon a solid and permanent basis—one that will enable tlieiu to
increase its sphere of ii«efulne«s and attractiveness to all classes of the public.
To accomplish the following desirable ends: 1st. The extinguishment of all debts
which may no# lie due b> the Association. 2nd. The erection of suitable building«
for the Mechanic. il ami Agricnltnaal products exhibited, and for the protection of
stock—the Directors have adopted the foregoing plan, which seems to thetn the only
feasihleand practical way of raismgthe necessary funds. In proposing thisscheme t.lie
Directors do not disguise from themselves the difficulties whi^h must attend its
execution; lint reposing their confidence in the worthiness of their aims, they a|i
lieal to the sympathy aud pride of the citizens, especially of tili« and our sister par
ishes, and to every public spirited Loiiisianiati. to come forward and aid an enter
prise, which se ks only to build up and develop the resources of our beloved State.
The object of the Association is to create a renewed interest among all classes of
our citizens In our coming Fair, and at the same time, by offering large inducements,
to stimulate the sale of its tickets to an extent that, will enable it to realize an
amount adequate to its pressing wants. The plan of The Association is to issue 20,
000 ticket« at seventy-five cents a t cket—the price of admission to the Fair, with a
coupon attached bearing a uiiiii i nt : the said ticket entitling the holder to one ad
mission to the Fair, the c<iu|>on being retained by himself.
On the last day of the Fair, numbers corresponding with the number of tickets
issued, will be placed in a wheel, and • 11 of the prizes in another, when the Grand
Drawing will take place under the vision of the following well-known gen
t lernen :
Gov T. O Moore, Judge T. C. Manning, Dr. G E. French, Dr. T. H. Maddox,
Dr. Jno. Cassou, Dr. II. St John. T. Ii. J. Ifowles, Judge G. Baillio,
