The persistancy with which the
White radical leaders South decant
upon the return of fraternal feeling
between the two sections of the
rFion, would lead the unknow
ing to suppose that they were incln
ded in this general "hand shaking."
Nothing could be further from tihe
truth; as soon would the people
South, and even the true men North,
.o4re general amnesty to all the jail
birds in the Union, and indulge with
them in an era of sublime good feel
iug.B
The men who have robbed, insult
ed sad murdered our people, are not
such as we desire to fraternise with
there would be too much "gush"
sbog( it for the taste of Southern
gentlemel. Besides, their papers
in one column speak in glowing terms
of brotherly love, and in the next
deMaonce us as a set of White League
cfhreoats. Such staff as that, we
lioanderstand, and if the radicals
of Louisiana from Kellogg and An
derson down to the lowest "Quilp"
is the party, expect any forgiveness
they are much mistaken.
The political situation in our
State astpresent, presents nothing
of importance of which to speak.
Kellogg took his turn at the axe,
smd beheaded a large number of
obls: and left Antoine to "do
up' the remainder. Radical cir
deware all in a working condition
asking up slates for the next
aiotpaign. The Democratic and1
Conservative party are resting
quietly, with full possession of all
ositions for a 'charge upon the
gsag"iiext fall, which. must end
ia their complete rdute.

On Sunday evening, Anugunst 23th, 1875,

aged 25 years and 29 days.
The snhject of the above notice wsN

the :l1st dlay' of July 1,50, being-i the sou
of our esteemed townsmnan, !Mr. (Ger\vtis

on the 10th of December, 1872. li had
not been in good health for years, as in
adicated by his appearacel, though he
had1 no well developed disease and made
no couiplaints, hearing his Antireinhg with
great patience and devoting his energies
to his business pursuits.
On Sunday evening, August 29th, while
at the residence of Capt. L. Caspari, ap
parently in his usual health, being out in
the yard with other memlbers of the
famlily watching the amulsements of the
children, lihe suddenly fll to the ground
anld died imnllediaitely, before iny I'relief
could he Itifiarded antd even before lie
could be carried into the house. The
suddennes.of his death was such a terrible
shock to his family and friends as pecul
iarly entitles them to our sympathies.
He leaves a wife and one child, be
sides, a large circle of relatives and
friends, to mourn his loss.
"Monto" was nioted for his patience and
integrity, and was universally loved by
those who knew him, for the purity and
sihialic:ily of his clhairactor. True aind
devotted in his domitestic relations, up
right in business, :flfahil in society, con

GRAPES! GRAPES!
I ofer for sale Grape Cuttings of in
_improved native varieties, ;at the fol
lowing prices:
Concord at $1 75 per dozei, or *12 00
per hundred, fitly tested.
Ray's Victoria $1 50 per dozen, or
$10 00 per hlndred, not fully tested.
I amn testing other native varieties, and
as they prove valnableo in my locality
and soil, will propagate them.
Orders can be left with M. I. Carver,
Esq., in the city of Natchitoches, or with
myself at the Village of Allen, parish of
Natchitoches.
I will deliver the cuttings on or about
the 20th of January, 1876, at my resi
donce, or at M. H.Carver's, as desired.
In all cases cash olt delivery.
I send a few bunches of each kind to
Mr. Jas. H. Cosgrove, Editor of the Viii.
dicator, that persons wishing may see
and examine for themselves. I guaran
tee them delivered true to name.
Every family that, owns an acre of
land or has the control of a garden,
should plant grapes for their own con
sumption, as the expense and labor is so
little eompared with the luxury and
profit received in return, when rightly
cultivated, prtned and trained. I recom
mend the ,llurclase of A. 8. Fuller's
Grape Cnlturist which can be had of Jas.
. Hunnmmel, Editor of Our Home Jour
nal, New Orleans, at 1 so. In chapter
15, page 129 to 144, inclnsive, will be
found full and plaiu instrluctions for
prnning and training. I would, howev
er, give more distance to *the vine than
he recomendes, owing to difference in
olinanite. I would. plant in rows nine
feet wide and tn feet in the drill, so as
to give more wood to the vine, anda
better circulation of air.
This systesl is called the "Double Arm
System," miand seems well adapted to the
South,; and is highly recommended by
C. C. Langdon, of Mobile, Ala., an old

sider very high authority.

art journal, did not prove the inditfer
emce of the l'opleh of Amterica to the
claimls of high art. o soon as a proper

onie rallied with eniithlusia.l to, its sill
port. and the rel'sult was a great arti;lstic
atwil cotm ,rial triumli--'rI"E ALDINE.I
TillE ALDINE, while i!0sed with all lhe
regularity. has none of the t;,t:lporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordit;ary
l.ri lieals. It is an elegant miiscelllan:y
of pure, light and graceful literature ; .oI
'a collection of pictures. thi: rarest speci
mIens of artistic skill, in ,la'k and white.
Although each succeeding num!,ber afflrdls
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value land beauty of the AI.It'sE will be
most appreciated alfter it has beet, lboulnd
upi at the close of the' year. While other
jou*rnals iay el:aim superior cheapness, as
colimpared with ri tal. of a sinilahr class,
the ALIiINt. is a unlique and original con
ception--alone and unapponeheld--bihso
lutely without comipetition in price or
character. The Iossessor uof a cmciplete
volume cannot duplicate the quanflty of
fine paper and engravings in any other
shape or iunmbler ofvolumies for ten times
its cost ; and then, there is the Chrolmo
besides!
National feature of TIlE ALTPINE
must he taken int no narroW sense. True
art is cosmopolitaul. Wlhle 'l'llE AL
D1INE is a strictl. Anlmericanl institution,
it does not confine itself entirely to he
reprodection of antive art. Its mission
is to caltivate a broald and: "aprlciative
art taste, one that will discriminate 1only
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thus.
while placing bcefore the patrons of TllE
ALDINE. as a leading characteritie, the
prohluctions of the most noted American
artists, attiention will .lways lhi given to
specimcus fronti fireigm, maclsters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and itilrue
tion obtainable from home or foreign
sources.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its mlmaglificenlt
plates are of a size more approlpriate to
the satisfactory tlreatment of details
than can le atihrded by any inferior
page. The judicious interseslersio of
landscape, marine, figure, and aniillal
subjects, sunstain an unala.ted interest.
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light and gracetill accoin
panliment, worthy of the artistic fea
tirts, with only such technical disirisi
tions as do not inoterfere with the popu
lar ilterest of the work.
