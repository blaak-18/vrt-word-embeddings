keepers) is one of the reliable exposition
hotels in Chtico. The appointments are
perfect, the location unequaled, and, in
view of the fact that the buildinag is
absolutely fireproof, the rates -- per
day for each person, two persons in a
room-are remarkably liberal. S.oroe of
hotels erected in the World's Pair terri
tor are veritable flretraps. The "World's

ife and property. The location, directly op
nosite the Fair grounds, and in close prox
Imity to steam and street ears, adds to its
attractiveness. Although it contains 800
commodious rooms, it is only three stories
