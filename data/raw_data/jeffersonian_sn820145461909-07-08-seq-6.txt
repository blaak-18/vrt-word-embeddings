FROM THE BERRY SCHOOL.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I think you
can do our school a great deal of
good by making an appeal to Geor
gians and all Southerners to come
forward and help us raise SIOO,OOO
for our school. We are rejoicing
over the $50,000 given by Mrs. Sage
and Mr. Carnegie—s2s,ooo each.
This is a conditional offer, and I
must work very, very hard to raise
the $50,000. Now that we have half
of it promised we are hoping that
our own Georgia people will help us
out. I know of no better way. to get
this money than by asking for the
generous and loyal support of the cit
izens of our State through the press.
I look to you to make a strong ap
peal in our behalf, because I know
you can do so in a “fetching” way
(I hope). Ido want to raise at least
$25,000 in Georgia. If 100 men
would give SSOO each we could get
the $50,000, or if 500 people would
give SIOO. Please help us out. I
have been working on these philan
thropists for a long time, and I cer
tainly want to use every effort to
show them that I can raise the re
quired amount.
Sincerely yours,
MARTHA BERRY,
Founder of the Berry School, Incor
porated, a Christian Industrial
School for Country Boys, Rome,
Ga.
Ed. Note:—We heartily commend
the above to the favorable considera
tion of our readers. To such schools
as this should be contributed the
gift-offerings of our people, not to
the colleges in Suchow and Wuchow
and Huchow and Fuchow and Tung
chbw and Yangchow and Chowchow.
A VERY IMPORTANT POINT.
Dear Sir: —I have been intensely
interested in your articles on For
eign Missions. I never knew before
the extent of those secular schools.
Now, with your permission, allow
me to request, in case you write
more on this, that you develop this
fact: while we, of the South, have
spent our monies in China, Japan,
etc., the Northern people have spent
their millions on the negroes of the
South. They took the South for their
field of operation, confining their
-work, religious and secular, among
the negroes. While our work had a
religious motive to spread the gos
pel, the Northern philanthropists had
in view a political purpose. We went
to China and Japan and Korea, etc.;
they invaded the South. With what
result? For forty years they have
spent millions and millions in South
ern states on negro schools and col
leges, secular schools, to such an ex
tent that the negro colleges of At
lanta alone have more endowment
money than all the white colleges,
male and female, of Georgia, com
bined. In that one city! Leaving
out Augusta, Macon, Columbus,
Rome, Americus, Albany, Thomas
ville, and others, whose negro
schools and colleges under Northern
auspices abound.
It is startling how the North has
invaded the South for negro educa
tion, while we have gone to China,
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
Japan, and other foreign countries.
The Northern policy confronts us
with this solemn fact, —that negroes
are being educated and poor whites
not. Hence, public duty, business,
our civilization, our preservation
from mongrelization of our politics,
demand that the South take hold of
the educaton of illiterate whites.
We must do it; the North will not.
They go where the smell of the Afri
can attracts.
Taft’s plan is for educated negroes
to vote, to be recognized, and he says
our disfranchisement laws will be
permitted, provided that in the ap
plication we eliminate the illiterate
white as well as the black, and that
there be no distinction at all as to il
literacy. He threatens us with the
Supreme Court if we undertake to
hold uneducated white voters and
eliminate the uneducated blacks. So
we see where the rub will come.
When the uneducated white man
sees that the “educated” negro is
placed above him and allowed the
ballot over him, then will arise such
acuteness of the race question as will
startle the world! As no Northern
hand is extended to the poor white
man of the South, but to the negro,
for political purposes, how urgent be
comes our duty to offset the work of
the North among the negroes by ed
ucating our own needy whites.
And it is this view of the subject I
hope you will develop. We must
meet negro education by white edu
cation, and this is why I write to call
your attention to this phase of the
subject.
Our religious denominations can
not well abandon what they have
done, but they can decline to increase
their labors on the line of secular
schools, and turn to a preparation
for meeting the conflict between “ed
ucated” negroes and uneducated
whites.
It was sorry statesmanship on the
part of the North to spend its mil
lions on negro education, and noth
ing to advance and help and educate
needy whites. Our soldiers of the
future must be white men, not ne
groes. And as the North prefers the
negro and refuses the helping hand
to our illiterate white children, It
then is imperative on us, of the
South, to come to their rescue; and
that done, in future years, we can ex
tend operations in foreign fields.
Truly, etc.,

IT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP.
Dear Sir:—l wish every laboring
man in America could read your Jef
fersonian one year. I think that
would settle the question.
Now, brother reformer, Mr. Wat
son has, and is, making a great sac
rifice trying to educate the people,
and arouse them, that they may
throw off the yoke of bondage and be
free once more. Writing letters
praising Mr. Watson’s noble work is
all right, and we know he appreciates
it, but what are you doing for the
cause of humanity, brother? Now
let us trun a new leaf and get down
to business and do our part. Let’s
make Saturday, July, the 3rd, Jef
fersonian day. Let’s you and me and
*C3l)e Jeffersonian
every other reader of the Jefferson
ian go out and get one or as many
more subscribers as we can. Have
you ever thought what the result
would be? Now don’t flinch and
squirm and put up some pitiful ex
cuse. Go out and get them. It’s our
patriotic duty. Remember July 3rd.
Just think what a grand army we can
have if we will make a few pulls and
all pull together. Try it. Don’t for
get the date, July 3rd.
Yours truly,
L. KING.
Steprock, Ark.
“CEASE FIRING ON OUR
FRIENDS.”
Editor Jeffersonian: —I see in Let
ters from the People that a majority
of the writers want a National Con
ference attended by representatives
from all reform parties. Some of the
writers seem to advocate a union of
forces but want to retain the name
Populist, which would be fusion.
Others want Democrat spliced on to
the name, saying that there is a prej
udice against the name Populist,
which will keep voters away from us.
Great God, what an idea! Just how
any rational man can get the idea
that the use of the word Deemocrat
would improve any name is hard to
understand.
While I was raised in the Demo
cratic party, and was a blind party
slave until past middle age, there is
now no name which sounds more
empty to me. The man who cannot
be drawn to a party by the love of
principles advocated, but can be
drawn by the name is not only worth
less to the party, but an injury. Such
men would likely desert us when the
plutocratic band wagon comes on the
scene. Os course, if we have a Na
tional Conference and succeed in
forming a union of forces, which is
our only hope for success, then it
will be necessary to change the name
to avoid fusion. But to change the
name in order to induce individuals
to come to us is the silliest kind of
foolishness.
There is entirely too much being
said about Jeffersonian Democracy,
Jeffersonian principles, etc. Populist
principles are much better, and if
they cannot stand alone, they cannot
be successfully propped by the use of
the words Democrat or Jefferson. In
unguarded efforts to catch the par
tisan Democrat, the partisan Repub
lican is driven away. It is high time
that w r e rid ourselves of sectional
prejudice,—a commodity which has
been worn threadbare by corrupt pol
iticians and party bosses, to the very
great injury of all sections. On the
first Monday in January, 1861, I en
listed for service in the Confederate
Army at Darlington, S. C. We were
ordered to Ft. Sumter, but arrived
too late to take part in the com
mencement skirmish. On the 3rd of
June, ’6l, we went to Richmond, Va.,
in which State I served nearly four
years. And if there was any such
thing as duty in the army on either
side in that conflict, I suppose I did
mine. Being only 18 years of age at
time of enlistment, I knew about as
much about what I was going to war
for as a razorback hog would have
known. It is at least reasonable to
suppose that others about my age,
who entered largely into the make
up of the army on each side, knew as
little as myself what they were go
ing to war for. I feel very certain
that had my home been in the North
I would have served in the Union
Army. This being true, why feel un
friendly to those who fought on the
other side?
Let us turn our guns on the real
enemy who are numerous in the
South as well as in the North and
cease firing on our friends.

A RE-AWAKENING ON THE SIL
VER QUESTION.
Dear Sir: —In your reply to Ira V.
Maxwell in the June number of the
Jeffersonian Magazine as to the ef
fects of the gold standard system,
you present a pb.se of the silver
question as yet very little understood
in this country, but which is grad
ually and surely forcing itself upon
the notice of manufacturers, pro
ducers and exporters to the extent
that politicians and so-called states
men will be forced to consider and
discuss that silver issue as it relates
to our economic and trade relations
in the very near future.
When our manufacturers and pro
ducers generally throughout the
country fully comprehend the condi
tions you have presented, no subsi
dized press or class of politicians will
be able to suppress the demand for
effective legislation to correct the
evil.
A new awakening upon the silver
question is in the air, and I hope you
will make the Jeffersonian Magazine
the leading vehicle for its dissemina
tion by special articles from your able
pen along the lines of your reply to
Mr. Maxwell.
Very truly yours,
JAMES CONZETT.
LET THE DEMOCRATIC SHIP SAIL
TO THE POPULIST PORT.
My Dear Sir:—Can the Democratic
party of the South be insulted? First
the Denver Bryan Convention went
for the Georgia delegation with
“Marching Through Georgia” and
came near causing a fight. The same
body hissed the name of our greatest
soldier, Gen. R. E. Lee. Then Bryan
conciliated the niggers and got their
aid. He lost in the West by this
nigger deal, and his majority was re
duced in the South. The fact that he
got a single intelligent vote in the
South has caused me to lose both
sleep and flesh.
Mr. Blackburn wrote an article on
Dr. Lee’s sermon published in Sun
day’s Constitution in which I found
much to commend. He speaks of
Bailey as Bryan’s successor, and re
grets that Mr. Watson cannot come
with the Democrats, admits that they
must get back to the old landmarks
that Mr. Watson is camping on.
Here is a political ship at sea with
out a captain,.knowing neither lati
tude nor longitude, an old worm
eaten hull covered with barnacles,
even the rats have left it. This is
the kind of thing that our Democratic
friends ask a captain for. True, it is
good enough craft for Bryan or Bai
ley to master. We invite our Demo-
