dignity, waving his tail slowly, and
lifting his head for the customary
pat she bestowed upon it. He fol
lowed her with a lordly air of pro
tection down the steps into the yard,
where the eager fowls crowded round
her feet for the portions of meal she
scattered with a liberal hand. She
was a social being taking much com
fort in the companionship of her
animals, and usually had a cheerful
morning greeting for them all, but
this morning she attended to their
needs in a very silent and abstracted
fashion.
The chickens fed, she went into
the kitchen and prepared her own
breakfast. Her breakfast over, in
stead of preparing to lie down, Miss
Lathrop went to the telephone in
her hall and called up Dr. Lorrimer.
“I wish you’d come out here for a
few minutes, Boy,” she called. “I
want to consult you.”
‘‘All right,” came back promptly.
‘‘Be with you in ten minutes.”
She took a seat on the cool front
porch to await his coming. The
Maltese jumped on her lap, she
stroked it abstractedly, indifferent to
the loud purrs with which he de
manded conversation. Miss Lathrop
was thinking; thinking of the past
—the long years of nursing in
crowded cities, followed by the in
evitable collapse, when, after a long
illness, having a comfortable income,
the result of years of methodical
saving and careful investment, she
had come to this quiet town to spend
the rest of her life in peace and
quiet. She made many friends, and,
what with her small nousehold du
ties, her garden and her pets, had
thoroughly enjoyed the novelty of
rest and independence. But with
the advent of Lauretta’s baby a
strange unrest had taken possession
of her; there now seemed to be a
void in the hitherto fullness of her
content.
The click of the gate latch inter
rupted her musings. The doctor was
coming, his hat off, for the wind to
play through his close cut curls, his
step springy and alert, the light of
enthusiasm beaming from his hand
some sac presence calculated to
cheer the most pessimistic of pa
tients.
‘‘Well, confrere, I’ve come for the
consultation,” he said, dropping on
the steps at her feet and immediate
ly transferring the Maltese to his
own lap, where it placidly resumed
its nap.
‘‘The truth of the matter, Boy,”
said Miss Lathrop, ‘‘is this: I find
that old Tom and Towser and the
birds and chickens don’t quite fill my
life. I’m getting discontented. I
want something human to pet.”
‘‘Won’t I do?” inquired the ‘‘Boy”
soberly. ‘‘You can always have me
to pet.”
She laughed patting the curly
head at her knee. ‘‘You’re too big,
Boy. I want a baby.”
‘‘A baby? Well, if I find any
lying round loose I’ll bring you one.
Trouble is, most folks that own ba
bies have objections to giving them
away. Was it a boy or a girl baby
you were wanting?”
‘‘A girl; and I’ve found her al-
‘Seffarsonlart
ready. I want the Dismukes baby.”
The doctor whistled. “I’m afraid
you’ll have to take my offer and
chance it; that little Mrs. Dismukes
loves her baby better than her life.
She’ll never give it up.”
“It’s just this way, Boy. That
baby will take months to get well,
with the care I can give her. With
her ignorant young mother’s atten
tion, and away in the piney woods —
for they can’t afford to stay here
much longer—out of reach of proper
food and medicine, she’ll certainly
die; you know that.”
“Yes,” responded the doctor. “I’m
afraid she will.”
“There’s no doubt about it. Be
sides, her parents will probably have
half a dozen more. I’ve saved this
one, and I want her—and I want
you to persuade them to give her
to me.”
“Well, I’ll do my best. I’ll talk
it over with them today, and try and
persuade them that it is the best
thing possible—for the child. I
doubt if the mother will see it in that
light. In the meantime you go to
bed and sleep on it.”
“I’ll proceed to obey you,” said
Miss Lathrop, rising. “Do your best
for me, Boy, and I’ll try my powers
tonight.”
It was with fear and trembling
that the doctor broached the subject
to Lauretta when he made his morn
ing call. At first she could not un
derstand how it was possible for any
body to want another person’s baby.
Babies had always been regarded as
necessary evils by Lauretta’s people;
hers was—to herself alone —the
most precious thing on earth, but
that someone else—and that person
the nurse, the wisest and most skil
ful woman on earth, to Lauretta —
should want her was more than her
dazed mind could grasp. Very gen
tly the doctor told of all the advan
tages of Nurse Lathrop’s plan. She
listened so quietly that he began to
think he had overrated her affection
for the child, and, emboldened by
her seeming indifference, he con
tinued: “On the other hand, if you
take the baby back home, even
months from now, she will surely
die.”
These words Lauretta’s numbed
brain could grasp. Die? Her child
die, when she seemed so much bet
ter?
“Oh, doctor, save her! Jest save
her pore little life and I’ll do any
thing you say. Anything! I cain’t
see her die, I cain’t! If the nuss
wants her she kin have her, if that’ll
keep her alive. Will it? Will she
be shore and certain to live?”
The doctor was unprepared for
this wild outburst; the apathetic
creature was transformed; her hol
low eyes gleamed, her voice trem
bled, the breath came in gasping
sobs from her heaving breast.
“I believe so; yes, I am certain
that, with the care Miss Lathrop can
give her, she will surely live. Then
you can come and visit her. I am
sure Miss Lathrop will not object.”
But Lauretta shook her head. “All
I want is for her to live. To come
