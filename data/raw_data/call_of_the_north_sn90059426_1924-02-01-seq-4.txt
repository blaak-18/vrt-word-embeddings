—K-K-K
Has Mr. Burns or His Agency the
Right to Hire Marines to Help
Him Stage Hold-ups?
—K-K-K
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 30.
Can the Burns Detective agency,
even though its head be a Roman Ca
tholic and at the head of the govern
ment is secret service, stick a gun in
your face on a lonely country road at
night and take your automobile away
from you, even if you do happen to
owe some money on the car?
It’s possible for that agency or any
other recognized authority to possibly
seize your car on a conditional bill
of sale and get away with it if you
have neglected to make your pay
ments. But the question is, can the
fellow or fellows who seize the car do
it by sticking a gun in your face and
get away with the job in true hold
up style?
And another question is proper at
this point. Has Mr. Burns or his
agency any right to hire United
States Marines, soldiers belonging to
Uncle Sam and in the service, to help
him stage a hold-up? On this point
it is stated that eighteen marines in
all, on duty at headquarters in the
Munitions building, were approached
by a Navy Department clerk, who is
also a Burns operative, and offered
what looked like “easy money” if they
could get off for a few days. The men
were successful in obtaining leave all
right, all at the same time, and ten of
the eighteen are now under arrest
and out on bond of $3,000 each,
charged with robbery, larceny and dis
orderly conduct. Marine headquarters
here sty the ten marines will be dis
ciplined for “engaging in civilian
practices.” Here is the game they at
tempted to pull in connection with
two private detectives assigned to the
job by the Burns agency.
Hold-up Staged
The Burns men and the ten marines
held up eight taxicabs of the Pen
nant Taxicab Company, of this city,
and made away with the machines
near Upper Marlboro, Maryland, a
few nights ago. In less than half a
night the whole bunch were under ar
rest and in jail at Baltimore. The
hold-up was resorted to according to
the manager of the Taxicab company
to serve a writ of attachment for the
machines by a finance corporation in
New York city. Instead of taking the
machines or reporting to legal prac
tices to get possession of them the
Bums gang did it by trickery and at
the point of guns. No papers what
ever were served.
Business Rushing
The Washington taxicab company
suddenly had many calls for machines
from the detectives and the marines
who claimed they were going to a
prize fight at Upper Marlboro. Reach
ing that little Maryland town the en
tire crowd went into a hotel where
supper was ordered. While eating
the proprietor wanted to know what
was going on. The men told him the
detectives would be along in a short
time and it was not long before they
put in their appearance. The hotel
proprietor who had visions of a raid
of some kind made further inquiry
and when the detectives told him of
what they proposed doing he told them
they could not pull that sort of a
stunt in his place and ordered them
to move on, saying that he would no
tify the sheriff and the Washington
authorities, if they attempted that
sort of a hold-up.
The drivers were ordered to move
on towards Annapolis. Scarcely had
the light of Upper Marlboro faded
in the distance before the leading cab,
believed to have been occupied by the
detectives, was ordered to stop. The
driver foujid himself facing
a levelled pistol and v before the other
chauffeurs knew what had happened,
they too were covered with revolvers
of their alleged customers. In other
words the whole eight taxicabs were
seized, not by legal process, but at
the points of pistols.
“Get out and beat it. These taxi
cabs belong to us now,” one of the
drivers said he was told.
Walked Back to Town
The taxi drivers walked back to
Upper Marlboro while their former
passengers rode off in the direction
of Baltimore via Annapolis. The men
hunted up Sheriff Fink and told him
what had happened and within an
hour every road in that and adjoining
counties were blocked by deputy sher
iff and members of the Maryland
state constabulary.
Bandits Nabbed
Just before getting into Baltimore
the caravan was sighted and the
whole bunch put under arrest. With
out any fuss all of the men surrender
ed, turning over their firearms,
drove into Baltimore and were locked
up at a police station.
One of the original taxi drivers al
so claims that the man who covered
him with a pistol reached into his
pockets and took sll in money belong
ing to him. Consequently all of them
are now charged with robbery, lar
ceny and disorderly conduct and all
are out under $3,000 bond each. The
grand jury of that county has been
called to meet the First Monday in
April in an effort to secure indict
ments of the detectives and the mar
ines guilty of this hold-up. It was
CONGRESS MAY CANCEL
OIL LEASES
—K-K-K
The Mayfield Case Takes a
Peculiar Turn.
—K-K-K
The Democrats seem to have cen
tered their attacks right now on what
former Secretary of the Interior Al
bert B. Fall did or did not do, etc.
The investigation of that SIOO,OOO
loan is still going on before the
Senate Public Lands committee and
the secretary himself will be on the
stand next week, if he is physically
able to be there. He is in Washing
ton a sick man at the present writ
ing.
To Cancel Both Oil Leases.
Many members of the Senate and
House are attending the sessions now
of the Public Lands committee and
iara listening in on the testimony
with a view of taking steps to cancel
the leases given on naval pil reserves
to Harry F. Sinclair and to Edward
L. Doheny by former Secretary Fall.
It is said the House Democrats will
take this action if its leaders decide
that cancellation is within Congres
sional power.
Inquiry in the Senate shows that a
similar state of mind exists in that
body. Congress seems to be convinc
ed that altogether aside from any
wrongful behavior by Mr. Fall the
leases in themselves are against pub
lic policy and also flatly contrary
to the mandate given by Congress
to the Navy Department for oil con
servation.
Leaders in the House and in the
Senate irespective of what may hap
pen to Mr. Fall, are on their way
toward calling Secretary of the Navy
Denby on the carpet for a strict
accounting and responsibility for the
leases to Sinclair and Doheny. They
point out that the naval oil reserves
were confided by Congress not to Mr.
Fall, but to Mr. Denby and that the
present fate of the reserves is not
Mr. Fall’s but Mr. Denby’s responsi
bility from the Congressional and
legal standpoint. So we may have
an impeachment of a cabinet officer
if the Democrats can bring it about.
The Mayfield Case.
The Mayfield contested election case
has taken a peculiar turn. A short
time ago the Senate ordered 40 de
puty sergeant-at-arms sworn in to go
over the state of Texas and collect
up the ballot boxes and ballots, tally
sheets, etc., of the senatorial elec
tion held last year and ship them
under registered seal to Washington
for counting by the sub-committee of
the Senate committee on Privileges
and Elections. Each side in the case
picked 20 men and most of them
were residents of the Lone Star state.
Now word comes from Texas that
the deputies are having their troubles
down in Texas. One county, Dexar
county, it is said refuses to send
its ballot boxes to Washington for
the reason that some other kind of
an election has been held there since
the senatorial election and that a
special road election or some other
kind of an election is about to be
held and that the ballot boxes are
needed down there. It is said that
court action will be necessary to get
the ballot boxes up to Washington.
Ballots Burned.
Word also comes from Texas that
in another county the senatorial elec
tion ballots were burned by mistake,
therefore are not to be had. It is
reported that an employee was told
to destroy by fire certain election
ballots and that he got the wrong
ballots and burned those of the sen
atoria election. That will prove an
other handicap, for the senatorial com
mittee.
And in one or two other counties
in Texas it is reported that special
elections of various kinds are about
to be held and that the official do
not want to send the ballot boxes to
Washington fearing they will not be
returned in time and those counties
do not want to buy new ballot boxes.
Supposed To Resume February 11.
The sub-committee of the Privi
leges and Elections committee was
scheduled to begin counting the Texas
ballot in Washington on February 11.
Now it is said that the ballots will
not be here in time and if it takes
court action to get some of the bal
lot boxes goodness knows when the
ballots will all get to this city and
those that have been burned are gone
forever. Just what bearing this will
have on the Mayfield case is hard to
cell right now.
said that the Marines understood they
were to receive $5 and their expenses
to drive the cabs to New York city.
Criminal charges are to be pressed
against the “highwaymen” who hired
the drivers of the stolen cars to drive
them to Upper Marlboro and then
forced'them at the points of pistols to
turn the cabs over to them.
The Washington taxicab company
has recovered its eight cars and they
are back here in service. Meanwhile
the guilty marines are wondering
“where they are at” and are looking
to the Bums agency to get them out
of their predicament. And the coun
try is wondering how a government
agency can pull stunts like that, es
pecially in view of the fact that they
secured eighteen marines on duty and
pressed them into a night-riding
holdup. This might well be the sub
ject of another congressional investi
gation.

Fight to Liberalize House Rules Gives
Combined Faction Chance For
Oratory.
—K-K-K
Congressional Record Being Filled
With Campaign Thunder for
Home Consumption.
—K-K-K—
--(Bureau Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C.—Partisan
spirit is running high this week in the
House of Representatives and every
fellow is busy “getting it out of his
system” for home consumption by his
constituents. The vehicle afforded for
this display of oratorical fireworks is
the debate on the proposed change in
the rules that govern the proceedings
of the House.
Hundreds of speeches are being
made on the floor by Republicans,
Democrats and Progressives and each
fellow is having his say as to what
he thinks about making drastic
changes proposed in the fight to lib
eralize the rules. The fight was
started by the LaFollette group of
Progressives in the House headed by
Representative Nelson of Wisconsin,
and they have formed a coalition with
the Democrats. So far they have won
their points and it looks like this
combination will be able to make such
changes as they desire. The debate
bids fair to run on and on for a week
or more. It seems to be the agree
ment to give every member a chance
to make his speech and have his say
and most of the 435 members are
availing themselves of this opportun
ity.
Petition Plan Proposed
The Progressive-Democratic com
bination is making its fight to keep
committee chairmen from pigeon
holing measures that they do not see
fit to report out of committee to the
House. The scheme is that after a
committee has had a measure before
it for thirty days that the author can
have that committee discharged from
further consideration of the measure
and get it out of committee and be
fore the House if he can get a peti
tion containing 100 or 150 signatures
of members of the House asking that
such action be taken. The exact
number of signatures required has
not been voted on; some members
wish the number cut to 100 and
others wish to make it 150. In either
event, they argue that any measure
that is desired to come before the
House ought to be brought there if
100 or 150 members of the House
sign a petition to that effect rather
than let a committee chairman carry
it around in his pocket or place it in
a pigeon hole for safe keeping where
it will take on “sleeping siekness”
after so long a time. The Progres
sives also contend that even if a
chairman of a committee is disposed
to bring the matter before his com
mittee that often from seven to a
dozen members of that committee
can smother a bill and kill off legis
lation no matter if all the rest of the
members of the House wish it re
ported out of that committee to the
House.
The regular Republicans argue
that if the rules are changed in this
respect that the minority can at any
time embarass the majority party
and handicap legislation in Congress
and work a hardship on any program
which may be formulated by the
party that is supposed to be in power.
It is asserted that it will take on the
appearance of a filibuster and pro
long discussion and debate on unim
portant legislation and act to the
detriment of a legislative program
mapped out for the country by the
majority party.
Spade Called a Spade
In this fight Republicans, Demo
crats and Progressives are not minc
ing words. They are calling a spade
a spade and the House is in good-na
tuied uproar most of the time by
the continual twitting from both
sides of the chamber. When the
Democrats were in the saddle dur
ing the eight years of the Wilson
administration they did the same
things the Republicans are now ac
cused of doing, but there was not as
many idnependent Democrats among
them as there are Progressive insur
gents in the House today.
Republicans on the floor of the
House assert that if the Democrats
ever again get back in power in Con
gress they will be confronted with
the same tactics as are now proving
embarrassing to the party in power.
The Democrats are helping the Pro
gressives make it hot for the Repub
licans and the latter are making
threats of retaliation if the time and
opportunity comes for them to do so
This fight on the rules is so in
teresting that it is filling the gallery
of the House every day with visitors
who like to hear the fun, and many a
senator strolls over from the Senate
end of the Capitol to listen to the
oratorical efforts in the lower branch.
This fight reminds one of a football
with every member of the House try
ing to take a kick at it. Some right
good punts are being seen and the
Congressional Record is being filled
full of good campaign material which
no doubt will be broadcast by mail to
every nook and corner of the land.

The CAM. OF THE NQSTH
A LETTER THAT SHUULD AWAKEN ALL AMERICANS
WRITER RECENTLY RELEAS
-K
Corliss Hooven Griffis, for
mer Lieutenant in the United
States Army, was arrested in
Germany a little more than a
year ago whoile trying to effect
the capture of the infamous
Grover Cleveland Bergdoll, a
traitor and deserter from the
United States Army. Lieut.
Griffis has been sentenced to
nineteen months’ imprisonment.
His immediate release would be
considered by the American peo
ple as a most gracious act on the
part of the German Government,
but Germany most strangely de
lays this action.
The following is a copy of the
last letter received from Lieut,
s Griffis by his mother:
Wurzburg Prison, Germany,
November the Eleventh, 1923.
Dearest Mother:
“The church bells are ringing
again this morning, and I am won
dering if they are reflecting in their
tumult of sound the gladsome way
I am feeling. I dare say their mes
sage today is quite different from
the one that is dominating me, but
they sound cheerful and glad enough
to quite fit in. Moreover, the sun
ia shining and a shaft of golden light
has made a mockery of the iron
bars and has penetrated into my ce’l,
where it makes a great difference.
Then, not tobe outdone on the occa
sion, the prison has finally decided
that it is cold enough for heat—and
the steam pipes are warm, with a
promise of a decided change for the
better in the inside temperature.
So altogether it is a great day, a
quite fitting time for thanksgiving,
pride and rejoicing in every way for
me—and one in particular.
Patriot Decorates Cell
“I have already decorated my cell
so that it is no doubt different from
any other cell in Germany. From
the colored advertisements in the
Saturday Evening Post I have been
hard at work with my scissors, and
have cut out and pasted together the
various colors until I have achieved
the desired result. At one end of
the cell under the window is a gor
geous Coat-of-Arms of the United
'States. It took me a week to make
it and it is inlaid in paper like a
mosiac. The background is orange,
good and bright, and bald-headed
eagle with the shield, and all the
rest are in the correct colors. It
looks fine. Then over my table I
have hung my American flag, and on
the other wall is an American shield.
Altogether, I could not desire more,
and really, it helps. ,
I started off the day by singing
the “Star Spangled Banner” as I
faced my flag at salute, regardless
of the prison rule against singing.
Then I followed with the “Battle
Hymn of the Republic” and the
“Glory, Glory, Halleluiah” had a
strange setting way over here. But
it rang true and stirred my heart
quite as much as had I heard a
chorus of a thousand voices singing
it. After that I whistled the “Stars
and Stripes Forever,” but then I
thought I had better write this letter.
I shall go through my entire program
and will sing and pray all day—even
though I am quite alone.
Fought For His Country
Naturally, my mind reverts back
to the events of five years ago to
day, when in the midst of our tur
moil and hating and sorrowing, we
achieved peace. I can remember my
own feelings in Le Mans that day
easily, for it is not so far from Wurz
burg as it is from Hamilton, Ohio.
Then later, I cannot but think of the
days of anniversary that followed
each year at home, and I like to
hriiur hack tha memories of some of
our celebrations.
How time does change things. It
was just a year ago at this very day
and hour, that Chaplain Cowley
Carroll and myself went out to the
cemetery where we held our little
service for our dead. . Amid the
quiet groves of Greenwood that day
I had little thought indeed that an
other such day would find me in a
German prison. But even had I
known, please God I would not fal
ter from a trust, a heritage, of brave
fellow countrymen.
For at least it has been given me
to feel for my country as never be
fore did I feel. Truly it has been
said that ‘they know not their own
country who know no other.’ Thus
it has been with me, for the more I
see of the world- and the people, the
more I love and reverence America.
And I am sure that comparison is a
great enlightening factor. For that
reason I wish more Americans
would travel—and some home con
vinced.
Has Faith In America
I only wish that I had the power
to deliver myself of this tremen
dous certainty I feel in the destiny
of America, and enlist every Ameri
can in evangelization until it is
achieved. I am firmer than ever df
the opinion that America will be
God's instrument, and our destiny is
to work His will on earth for His
purposes, not ours. And oh, how
this part of the world over here
needs us! They need our standards
and our Ideals, our generosity and
our fellow love, " They need our
“square dealt” and our principles of
ED FROM GERMAN PRISON
c-k
“Americanism.” They need our
loving God, and can forget their
gods of revenge and hatred.
“Thus it is that America must be
strong with the individual strength
of one hundred and ten million peo
ple who will all work together to a
common goal, actuated by the love
of God and country. What a power
that would be—and yet, the old world
needs it.
“It may be a dream of mine. But
I am sure it will occur some day. I
would not love America if I did not
think so.
“I am very happy today, and very
proud to be here. Believe me, for
it is the truth.
“Certainly my trial will take
place shortly, although I have heard
nothing as yet. From that event we
will hope for the best, and whatever
the outcome, know that it is for the
best.
Lots of love,

Coast.
K-K-K
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.—Although
California has long been known as a
strong Klan state, it has recently be
come apparent that the Ku Klux Klan
is again sweeping the state with re
newed vigor. Just what has causea
tins sudden sweep of the organization
nas not been fully determined, al
thougn it is known that the growth is
so big that it will be necessary to aid
in pKp.'rly organizing and tak'ng
care of Jie sudden increase.
Among those men from other state
'• ill be about forty to fifty men from
the central states. A few field men
from .Indiana have already been plac
ed in the state and these will be fol-
Jowed by more from the Hoosier state
i >_ . which there are approximately 700,-
000 Klansmen. These men evidently
ctiiy a message which is possibly t.i»
real caluse for the sudden shooting up
in the d ily average of new Kins
men in California.
Reports have it that men from In
diana will be placed all along the
Pacific coast to aid in propagation
and with the renewed impetus it is
now expected that the Klan wave
will spread northward through Cali
fornia at a tremendous rate. Oregon
to the north of this state, abounds
with Klansmen and is said to be one
of the strongest Klan states in the
Union, although, of course, does not
come near Indiana, Ohio and some
other states in numbers on account
of the difference in population.
Additional Field Men Necessary
However, regardless of Oregon or
what might be the reason for the
sudden and renewed move by citizens
of California, into the ranks of the
Klan, the fact remains that it is
necessary to send additional field
men to California in order to take
care of the fast increasing member
ship.
The Klan, which has long since
been recognized in California as a
staunch defender of true American
ism and Protestantism, has flourish
ed most satisfactorily to those Ameri
cans who are determined that Ameri
canism shall prevail in the United
States. A great increase in Klan
membership is now being felt
throughout the west but it would seem
that at this time California is taking
the lead.

Red Bank, N. J. Seventy-five
members of the Red Bank and Long
Branch Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
were invited as guests to the Ocean
port Methodist Episcopal church last
Sunday night. The church was
crowded to the doors despite the
downpour of rain.
As the choir sang “Onward, Chris
tian Soldiers,” the doors opened and
out of the rain marched a Klans
woman bearing the banner of her
organiz tion, the American flag. She
was followed by another Klans
woman holding aioft the fiery cross
and following the cross-bearer came
Klansmen and Klanswomen. They
were ushered to seats which had been
reserved for the and received
welcome by the Rev. A. Parsells, who
invited the leaders to take seats at
his side.
Klan Conducts Services
“HOOVEN.”
The pastor read the twelfth chap
ter of Romans and then turned the
service over to the Klan leaders. The
addresses dealt with the duties of
Chrismen men and women in the
New Year.
The Klansman who spoke requested
all present to make resolutions for
the New Year. He suggested the
following as being worthy of consid
eration:
“To learn the real duties of an
American citizen and to practice
them; to study the political situation;
to be active in church work; to see
that only Americans are placed on
guard in 1924; and to try every day
to be of assistance to some poor soul
in need of financial or fratrnal aid.”
When the colection was taken it
was found that the plates were
heaped high with paper money and
this was acknowledged by members
of the church to be welcome, for the
little church has been having a hard
struggle. On Christmas day the min
ister’s home was destroyed by a fire
caused by the explosion of an oil
stove and all hi® furniture and per
sonal belongings destroyed. How
ever, the Klansmen at once rushed
up fifty dollars for his immediate
needs and followed this with their
visit to the church and the large do
nation.
