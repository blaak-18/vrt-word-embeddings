at- AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
o -
Idy Shall the SBoth Abandoanthe Culture of
CottoaT or How sthall We Mtake It olre
e Iremunerativet"
No question is more important than
to this. To the south, the proper an
sat swer involves every interest. The
at culture of cotton has been for many
years the principal industry of this
section.
Upon it was based not only the sue
Por cess or failure of the farmer, but, Itn a
he large measure, our entire financial pol
icy. Merchandise, banking and trans
portation were largely modified by this
SI crop.
TIHE MONEY INVOLVED.
n'y The lint sold, the seed products and
for the manufactured goods, annually
bat brought into circulation among us
k." over four hundred millions of dollars.
This gave life to every artery of trade.
or This of itself was a circulating medi
am of nearly or quite twenty dollars
per capitel added every year.
O VE CAN NOT RABANDON IT.
ace It would seem evident to the most
a ncasual thinker that the abandonment
of such a money-producing crop would
id- paralyize every branch of industry in
1at the land.
ra. The immediate effect would be a
ip- general cutting down of values. Every
n- acre of farm land would be worth less.
,m Every species of real estate would de
sa preciate. Merchauts would have to
give up their merchandise, and the
ad- railroads would run empty trains.
4- Lawyers would be without clients.
Schools would rapidly fall into decay,
and a general collapse, if not universal
ii- bankruptcy, would ensue.
PROVIDENTIAL CAUSES.
a We have the climate, the soil and
- the labor to grow cotton, to a greater
advantage than any other portion of
the globe can produce a similar grade.
rd It would not be wise to fail to utilize
k- all these.
ts TIlE CONSKEQUENCES.
n- If we abandon the culture of cotton,
k- we have in our midst a vast contingent
I of unemployed labor, idle, shiftless and I
to homeless. The negro does not know 1
e- how to support himself in any other
branch of agriculture.
is We must plant all the lands now i
used in growing cotton in some kind 1
of food-producing crops. This would r
soon glut the market with all that line
of produce. It would ruin the north- c
west, cut off the largest source of in- t
come to the railroads, break all the
commission men and provision dealers,
as reduce the price of provisions of all
at sorts so low that it would be a losing t
ad business to grow them, and the farmer I
is would be in a worse condition than a
Bs now, with cotton at five cents.
WIIAT SIhALL Wit DO TIIEN ?
There is a much better way out of t
this trouble. Ve can cheapen the pro- f
w duction of cotton by growing all our r
r home supplies upon the farm. Then, I
plant smaller areas in cotton, and f
mnanlire and cultivate better, so as to I
a. increase the yield per acre. Make no e
accounts, pay as you go, so that the t
cotton when grown will belong to the a
grower. Quit forcing the entire crop u
upon the market in three months. p
Distribute the sale over the whole a
twelve months, only selling as the fac- Ii
tories need it for consumption; this ii
will greatly improve the price. ii
WVe gin cotton because it brings a
higher price in lint and is easier h]an
died; for the same reasons, let us spin
the cotton and sell thread and cloth.
LTint cotton is worth three times as
much as seed cotton. Thread is worth i
three times as much as lint. Cloth, or
woven cotton, about three times as
niuch as thread, or six times as much
as lint. p
The increased value of one or two
crops will pay for all the machinery
necessary for the manufacture of the
entire crop. A little concert of action
will enable us to regulate this matter. st
We cane inaugurate this movemnent
ensier than we can give up the cul
ture of cotton and adapt ourselves to
a new system of farming and a new a
set of crops and hunt up new markets. ti
We only need a little more common
sense economy.

TWENTY YEARS HENCE.
A Nortlhern Granger icooks Into the Future
er the Soutlh.
It needs no prophetic vision on the
part of the careful observer to see
plainly that tile seat of the greatest
progress made by the people of the t
Unlted States will be in what is li
termed the southern states. This will In
be brought about by tihe sub-divisions
of the great plantations of the south yo
into small fnrms where intensive, in- tal
stead of extensive farming wvill be the sar
rule. Inten.sive farming can be fol
lowed only in a coyntry where climatic trc
conditions are such as to permit the in
raising of fruits and vegetables in the di
highest state of perfection, and it is
beyond question that the southern
states enjoy this climatic advantage. t
To-day all the great lines of rail
way of the northern states are seclking cc
southern connection. Reports of the
railway companies showthat it is only
those that have such connections that Co,
are able to report an increase of earn- Da
ings. With the facilities that these Tb
new lines of railway will afford tile ani
southern farmer, they will be enabled aca
to furnish the great cities of the
northwest with fruits and vegetables _
fresh from their orchards and gardens - it
at remunerative prices. w
There are also two other lines of out
farming in which the southern farmer to I
has proven that he can successfully -
compete with his northern rival, vie.: Ma,

le
to The nost Valuable Meauns of Conservlnl
te Farnm MDanures.
- Farm made manures are best pre
ts. pared for effective use by composting,
* that is, by a thorough rotting procesi
sal well known to the practical farmer.
To prevent the loss of ammonia as the
manure is being accumaulated, gypsumn
is sprinkled over the voidings in thi
stables, and it is also mingled with
er the manure heap as well. The princi.
of pie is that the gypsum (sulphate of
le. lime) gives up its sulphuric acid to
ZC the ammonia,thus forming sulphate of
ammonia, which is stable and suf
fers little loss. If such provision
n, were not made the ammonia
t would suffer much loss from volatiza,
id tion. There is one disadvantage is
w the use of gypsum in this way: the
or phosphates in the manure are apt to
take very insoluble and unavailable
w forms. The carbonate of limg formed
id by the decomposition of the gypsum
Id reacts with any soluble phosphate
ne present with the formation of tri-cal.
h- cium phosphate-practically the snnam
n- thing as untreated South Carolina rock
he phosphate.
's, A better method of treating com
ll posts, and manure generally, would be
ig to use low grade sulplate of potash, or
er kainit, in the place of gyprum. The
in ammonia would be preserved equally
well,and the agricultural value of the
phosphates suffer no loss. In fact,
of the phosphates would have a better
o- form than before if there was any
ur material difference. Phosphate of
n. potash is perhaps the best possible
id form of these minerals for agricultural
to purposes, and such reaction as could
to occur with the use of potash salts must
io take this form. But this is not the
te only a Ivautage; farm manures art
up universally deficient in potash as coin
s. pared with ammonia, not only in bal
Ic ancing the ingredients, but also in
e- holding; its potash and phosphoric acid
is in such, form as to be readily available

. t Foul breath is a
cela-rsrager of af
*'t fection. It In al
a ways an indicatiot
of poor health -
bad digestion. To
bad digestion is
tratcable almost all
hlunlan ills. It is
the starting point
of many very ser
ious maladies.
TUpon the healthy
action of the diges
tive organs, the
blood depends for its richness and purity.
If digestion stops, poisonous matter ac
cumulates and is forced into the blood
-there is no place else for it to go.
The bad breath is a danger signal.
Look out for it! If you have it, or
any other symptom of indigestion,
take a bottle or two of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery. It will
straighten out the trouble, make your
blood pure and healthy and full of nlu
triment for the tissues.
