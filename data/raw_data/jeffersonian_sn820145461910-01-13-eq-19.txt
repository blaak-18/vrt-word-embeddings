OF INTEREST TO FARMERS
PRACTICAL FARMING.
Hay should be well forked and
shaken and slightly dampened and
fed on the floor or in slatted man
gers.
The farmer should not buy his
work horses —he should raise them.
He can grow them at a profit.
It is better for the average farmer
to raise draft colts.
Only the man who is a born horse
lover can raise roadsters profitably.
Colts like fine hay much better
than they do coarse. Second-growth
hay, fed a little at a time, is prefer
able.
Shredded corn fodder is relished,
but should be fed in the same way—
a little at a time. Grain should be
fed liberally.—Texas Farmer.
TAME THE COLT.
Busy farmers sometimes let the
colt range the lot and pastures until
he is ready for service, and then they
“break" him. We never did like that
word. Gentle the colt during his first
fall and winter, and then he will
never have to be “broken.” All he
will need is training, and that is much
better.
In fact, we like to see the colt
handled from birth. It ought to be
taught in its very earliest days that
humans are its friends, and it should
never have any treatment that could
cause it to feel otherwise. Gentle
ness in the home and on the farm is
one of the noblest qualities, and it is
worth money and happiness to those
who possess it. What farmer does
not want to be a gentle man? — :Up
to-Date Farming.
FRUIT AND FOWLS.
The possibilities of combining
fruit and poultry raising on the farm,
especially in States adapted to fruit
raising, have never been fully real
ized. Wherever a judicious attempt
has been made to join these two in
dustries it has been attended with
success. Why abandoned farms are
not taken up and used for this pur
pose is a question that is to reach its
solution in the near future. People
are beginning to realize the profit de
rived from poultry and from an or
chard that can be fertilized and made
productive by fowls, whose manure is
one of the best fertilizers known.—
Farmers’ News Scimitar.
BAD BUTTER.
The cause of poor butter on the
farm may be traced either to a sin
gle poor condition or perhaps several
of them, according to the American
Farmer. By carefully carrying out
the following conditions first-class
butter should be produced: The
cream should be kept in as nearly
sweet condition as possible until
enough has been gathered for a
churning. This should then be sour
ed or ripened. To keep the cream
sweet, while gathering enough for a
churning, keep the can containing it
surrounded with cold water, or per
haps better, hang it in the well. To
ripen, place it where it will become
somewhat warmer, at a temperature
of 75 to 80 degrees, until it is sour
enough, then cool down to a tem
perature of 55 to 60 degrees, which
is right for churning. Let it stand
Zsl)t 'Jeffersonian
in this temperature for an hour or ao
before churning, if possible. This
will cause the butter to come in a
better condition.
Parsnips can be left in the ground
all winter. Freezing does not hurt
them, but on the contrary improves
their flavor.
Woman’s Right to Suffrage
(Concluded from Page 2)
floated the white banner of the con
quered cause. And out of that
travail of terror was born political
emancipation for all—except our
women. To-day a half century is
closing behind Lee’s surrender at Ap
pomattox. The daughters of Vir
ginia are now no longer of necessity
the pampered darlings of luxurious
ease. Many of them have known
the sharp shock of adversity. Thou
sands of them are publicly engaged
in some branch of business employ
ment. The hand that rocks the cradle
is often wearied with other cares, and
the responsibility of earning a liveli
hood is now frequently added to the
joys and sorrows of maternity. With
added responsibilities and the re
quired tribute of taxation we reaffirm
and reassert it as our profound con
viction that the women of this coun
try should enjoy the liberty of the
ballot. The active exercise of this
privilege should be left entirely op
tional. But the freedom of express
ing her convictions and will in the
government of this country should
belong to every woman in the United
States.—Richmond Evening Journal.
