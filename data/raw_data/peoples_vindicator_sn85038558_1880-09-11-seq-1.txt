A Traimp'4 Revenge.
[Detroit Free Press. J
A few d(lays ago one of the sedeliet I
sort of tramps, seemingly about fifty I
years old, attached himself to a free- .
lunch saloon on Monroe avenue and
soon felt perfectly at hdnoe. When11
ordered out he went out, but the I
trouble was he wouldn't stay out.
As a last resort he was kicked out,
but in an hour he came back and f
seemedl so hunmble and forgiving that I
the proprietor didn't like to give him 4
my more cowhide. After a day or
two a different plan was tried. The I
vag had several times referred to a I
pain in his chest, and the bar-keeper
mixed him up a cure. In ten nin- I
ites after drinking it he was excited- I
ly informed that he had been given a I
large dose of morphina by mistake.
A4 party was at hand to play doctor,
and it was decided that the tramp 4
must walk until he overcame the in
luenee df the drug. One anti anoth- I
er took turns with him until he had I
lnut in about four hours in the back
yard, and he was then told to walk
in the country at least live miles to
make his cure certain. He took the
case very coolly, never protesting a
word, and as he started for the green
ilelds it was supposed that the sa
loon had seen the last of him. Nev
ertheless, he returned in about four
hours, lame in the left leg, covered
with dust and apparently almost er.
hlausted. lie said he had walked in
vain. Finding that death was h'
termined to claim him, lie had re
turned to dio with his friends. ]Io.
fore they could protest he fell to the
floor, breaking the back off a chair
and upsetting a table, and after a
few kicks he was dead. A pint of
good brandy was wasted in rubbing
him, the saloon closed for an hour in
the face of a big business and an
undertaker and coroner called before
the old chap let any one know that
he wasn't dead. He came to in some
sort of a fit whleh required a great
deal of kicking, and he took good
care that every kick eountered on
something, When suliciently re
stored to sit up he was given nearly
half a pint of wine, hnd as his
strength increased ho got away with
enough luncheon for four men. It
was then deemed good policy , to
hnd him half a dollar and turn him
out upon the world. Just how much
prollt the saloon-keeper made in
p-aying the morphine trick is what.
lpnzule him for a week to come.
Foreigners are not to be blamed if
they gather singular ideas of Ameri
can manners in reading the details of
a lawsuit brought by one Mr. Finch,
a jeweler, of Newbern, North Caro
lina, agaitst Miss Waters, of the
same place. This young woman, it
seems, desiring a set of jet whieh she
was not able to buy, acceded to the
jeweler's prpeaoitlon that she should
take it. and pay for it with one hun
dred-kisses, at the rate of one kisa a
y. 8he gave Mr. Finlch, who call

those tender tunes one never can

Not many evenings since a friend I
was with me, a grave, quiet sort of a
person, whom I never dreamed had
so much of a sad story of her own, I
always imagined her heart set on
one thing only -hor church. She 1
soemed no practical, so self-posse.a

through and through all my masic

0), June 2R of the same year, Robert
i'.te, a retired Lieutenant of Hussars r
struck the Queen of England with a
cane-an assault, certainly, but not
an assault with intent to kill. In
October, 1S2, a conspitacy to blow
up Louis Napoleon with an infernal
machine containing 1,501 projectiles a
was frustrated by the activity of the 1
police. On i'eb. 17, 1M52, the Em. ti
jeror of Austria was stabbed in the Si
ack by a Hungarian shoemaker of s
the name of Iibeny. On the 5th of at
July following. a second attempt ti
wa;, made on the life of Louis Napo. a
loon, on hi way to the Opera Coml
que. On March -2o. lt4, Ferdinand (1
Oharlen lIT, Duke of Parma, was v

of Ihe dagger remained in the wound
which it inflicted, and the Duke died a
after twenty-three hours of terrible d
suffering. The murderer escaped.l t
In t~; the Italian Pianori, shot a
twice at the French Emperor in the I
Tuilleries garden. In March, 184S,, a f
Spaniard of the name of Italmond ti
l'uemen was arrested just an lie was tl
in the net orf firing a pistol at his "
noveringn, and the erecution of his
murderous design pervented. On ci
TDec. S, In the name year, Ferdinand p
I f., King of the Two piciies, was at. o
tacked at a review by one of his own tt
solf2lers, who wounded him with his h
bayonet. In 1857 the Italian con. tt
sprator., Tibaldi, Barthletti and p
(Irelli, arrived in Paris with the In. a
tention of murdering the Emperor, h
but fell into the hands of the pollce a
before their design could le carried o
into execution. On Jan. 14, ol the n
following year. Orsini, (lomes. Plerl n
and Rldio, made their famous at- h
tempt to blow up the Emperor and ci
Empress with bombhasells on their n
way ton the opera. Their Majesties ea
escaped with some slight contusions, c'
but more than li;) persons of their n
escort were killed and wounded. In
December, 1iS2. another attempt on h
the life of Napoleon was made by a o
band of Italian asssassins. The at- I
tempt failed, and the would-be mtour
derers were captured. The same a
year the then Quteen of Greece was h
wounded by a pistol-shot fired by ti
the student, Dosaes. On the 14th of p
April, 1985, President Lincoln was Gt
murdered in Ford's Theatre, at b
Washington by the actor. Booth; "
and Secretary Seward dangerously et
wounded by an accomplice. A year a
later, almost to a day, the Emperor ti
of Russia was shot at by a man of vi
good position, of the name of Pe- n
troulk, in the garden of his palaco;at n
St. Petersburg. A peasant who b

The month afterward, or, to be T
precise, in May, 18061 Eugene Cohen 11
fired five shots at Bismarck, while
the latter was walking Unter den
Linden, in Berlin, one of which [
struck and slightly wounded the a
great Minister. On June 10, 1868, I
Prince Michael of 8ervlia and a lady o
of his family were brutally murdered o
in the Park of Topeider, In 1872 n
Bismareck's life was again attempted tl
this time by a man by the name of ti
Westerwelio, and in 1874, yet againo,
this time by Kallman at Kissengen. 8
On Angust 6, 1875, the President of tl
the Republic of Ecuador, Gabriel e
Garcia Morono, was murdered in the
Government House at Qulto, and in *
April, s1877, a similar fate befell the e
President of the Republic of Para t
guay. On May 11, 1878, the German t
Emperor was shot at liHodel;and on
June 2d, less than a month later, by b
Nobiling, receiving on the latter o
iaston wounds by which his life was e
seriously endangered. NobllnA kill.

perished on the scaffold. On Oct. 25
of the same year an attempt to as.

made by the Socialist Monse, who,
taken red-handed, paid with his 1 life
the penalty of hie crime. Les than 1
a month thereafter, Nov. 17, the life i
of King Iumbert, of Italy, was at
tempted by Passanante, who.se sea
tonce of death was commuted, at his a

the Emperor of R nassia had two nar. ,

About half an hour before he died,
