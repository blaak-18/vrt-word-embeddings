The unprecedented success with which
the Times has met, since its establish
meut, is convincing evidence that the
peilde ofthe West and South, fully ap
preciate the efforts of a journal, whic ,
mu addition tio Its enterprise as a, news
paper, lihasthe' counge to boldly declare
itil constantly maintain the priuciples
of its political faith.
The public journal mostly deserving or
Democratic sulipport is the one that, in
addition to being a full and faithful and
consistent advocate of Democratic priu
eiples. A Democratic newspaper is the
newspaper for Deniocrats to support, and
the idea sonlmetimes sought to be inculca
ted by those who have an interest of their
own io doing so that the people must go
r'ataideth#ir party organ to "find' the
aew~'? ij absurd and irrational. There
is no eort of incompatibility .whatever
between the political and non-political
journal as to the matter of newsn; many
of the papers now 'publishled thlromglhout
the country, and especially valuable for
ieo amount and variety of their intoel
ligence, being also known for the ability
aid earneetness with which they cham
pion their peculiar party views. Hence
all things else ,eing equal, it is 'manliftt

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR ITr
rERs I" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessiug the remarkable qualities of VIs
EGAR BITTERs in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentlo Purgative as well as a Tonic.

the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WALK
ER'S VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa

Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilipus.

rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo

Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a;
powerful influence upon these vari
ous crgans. is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Da. J. WALKER'S V INEi;AI
BITTErs, 'as they will speedily remouve
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the livewr,
