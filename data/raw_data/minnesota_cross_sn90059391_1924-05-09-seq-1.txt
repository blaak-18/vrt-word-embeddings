TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
THE SOUL OF THE KLAN
AN EDUCATIONAL FETISH
THE HOLY WRIT
THE Living Christ is the Cen
ter of the Ku Klux Klan.
The spirit of the Nazarene gives
the Protestant movement its
mountainous strength for the up
holding of righteousness. With a
Christ-kindled zeal the citizens
of the Invisible Empire have con
centrated their forces for the
overthrow of evil. With its di
vine soul the Klan will ever move
forward toward the zenith of
human betterment. We must
never forget that Jesus is the
Criterion of all Klansmen, and
therefore the dominating factor
of our organization. If the day
ever comes, and God forbid,
when the Galilean no longer glo
rifies the Ku Klux Klan that day
will mark the passage of our
movement as a power for good.
We should early come to realize
that the Eternal Spirit dwells
not in the darkness of the Satan
ic night. It behooves you, Klans
men all, that you keep the Lamp
of High Twelve burning bright
in the Tower of the Invisible Em
pire.
IN OUR SCHOOLS, it is true,
we have been worshiping a
fetish, “knowledge for the sake
of knowledge." Our courses of
study have been organized from
the standpoint of culture rather
than efficient living. Someone
has said: "Scholarship is not the
aim of American schools, and
never should be; the emphasis
upon it has isolated schools from
public service, promoted pedant
ry, aristocracy, and snobbery. So
long as subjects not citizenship
remain the aim of educational in
stitutions of this country, these
institutions will be anti-demo
cratic.” 0. H. Benson says: “Ed
ucation is life, but it does not
follow that knowledge is life,
very often it is dead, inorganic,
and putrefying. Knowledge is
not power. Only the application
of knowledge to human needs
gives it power.”
Professor W. C. Bagley says:
"Many of the so-called culture
studies have little or no practical
utility under present conditions.
They represent, in other words,
experiences which the individu
al has very little occasion to ap
ply to existing problems of life.
Yet they remain a part of the
curriculum of the schools, and in
many cases they dominate the
curriculum. They are condoned
and justified in various ways—
some of the attempts to justify
their continuance being so la
bored and involved as almost to
appear ridiculous. The real rea
son for their persistence, howev
er, is that they represent, espe
cially in ultra-conservative coun
tries like England, ‘the things
that a gentleman must know,’
which is only another way of say
ing that they give a man the ear
marks of gentility—certain hab
its of thought, certain tricks of
speech, that serve to differenti
ate him from the ungentle.” The
American schools are gradually
getting away from that educa
tional fetish which we have wor
shiped too long, "knowledge for
the sake of knowledge.” But on
ly the other day I entered a class
room in one of our high schools
where the students were strug
gling with the various dynasties
of ancient Egypt. The end is not
yet.
I WONDER how much dust
covers your Bible. It would
be interesting to know how well
preserved your copy of the Word
of God really is. Are there any
finger prints or marginal nota
tions on its pages? Can you turn
quickly to John iii.l6 or Esther
iii:s? Have you ever read the
second chapter of the general
Epistle of Jude. Some people
know so little about the Bible
that they think that the Epistles
were the wives of the Apostles.
Many of you know your ledgers
and journals better than Holy
Writ. Every dozen times in a
while I come across women, yes,
mothers, who are more familiar
with the writings of Bertha Clay
than the Sublime Library. To
not a few, "Ashes of Love.” is
more interesting than the Gospel
according to St. John. I, when
all is said and done, would rather
have my children grow to adult
hood with only a common sehool
education and a thorough knowl
edge of Gods Word than a college
•di’eation minus a Biblical train
ing. Consider well that state
ment.

RACE FOR GOPHER
GOVERNORSHIP

14 Years—ls Sixth
Republican
“MORE THE MERRIER”
Scores Indifference of Citizenship
in Exercising Prerogatives
of Government
Julius A. Schmahl, for 14 years sec
retary of atate, has filed for the Re
publican nomination for governor at
the state primary election June 16.
In a statement issued at the time
of his filing with Secretary of State
Mike Holm, Mr. Schmahl said that he
was entering the primary race as a
“friendly competitor/' and not as an
opponent of those already filed.
Six Republicans In Race
With this latest entry, there are
now six Republicans in the guberna
torial race. They are:
Curtis M. Johnson of Rush City;
Theodore Christianson of Dawson; 0.
P. B. Jacobson of Minneapolis; Mayor
George E. Leach of Minneapolis; and
Franklin F. Ellsworth, Minneapolis
attorney and author, and Mr.
Schmahl.
“Numerosity of filings in a prim
ary election is desirable as long as
they are friendly competitors and
not uncompromising opponents” Mr.
Schmahl’s statement said.
Bees Interest Stimulated
“They stimulate party interest and
give every voter an opportunity to
express his individual preferences,
and if harmonious action follows pri
mary results, they form an active, en
thusiastic working force that pre
sages success at the polls.
“I am constrained to believe that
there never has been a time when the
exigencies of the situation made a
Republican victory as essential to the
welfare of the state and nation as at
present. Any candidate who enters
the Republican primaries who does
not unqualifiedly pledge his support
to the winners is not entitled to any
support at the hands of the Republi
cans, and to such support I pledge
myself without reservation or quali
fication.
“I have no promise to make of won
derful achievements, in case I win
in the primaries and at the polls. In
my opinion, it is high time that we
return to constitutional government
—a government of laws and not of
men.

it with the subcommittee appointed
to hear the case agfinst R. B. Creagar

Robed Men
# *
MONCK’S CORNER, S. C., May 2.
Thousands of people gathered near
here a few nignts ago to witness the
open-air ceremonial of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan. It was one of
the most impressive sights witnessed
here in many years and caused much
favorable comment from the spec
tators.
The initiation ceremony was pre
ceded by a short speech by the Rev. S.
J. Parrish, of St. George, who spoke
on Americanism. He stressed the
importance of every true American
citizen being on the alert in behalf
of his country.
At the conclusion of this important
address a signal was given in the
woodland near the ceremonial
grounds, and hundreds of robed
Klansmen marched onto the field in
an orderly manner, without speaking
a word. Behind the robed Klansmen
came scores of candidates in charge
of an officer of the Klan, who direct
ed their movements with military
commands.

“PUT AMERICANS ON GUARD” —GEORGE WASHINGTON
ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, MAY 9,1924
Primary Versus the Old
Convention Days Debated
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., April 26.
The moot question, “Party convention
or direct primary?” was before Lin
coln club members Friday noon at a
luncheon in the West hotel.
Representative John E. Stevens of
the Thirty-third district argued for
the return of the party convention
system, claiming that the primary is
a heavy expense, that the selection of
a party nominee is not obtained by
majority vote, and that a convention
is necessary to eatablish a platform to
which candidates would be held re
sponsible.
W. T. Coe championed the present
direct primary. He contended that
in the 23 years of its operation in
Minnesota, and particularly the last
12 years when it was state-wide, no
public scandals have arisen in the
state, and the caliber of men in pub
lic office has been high. He be
lieved the judicial branch of the
government in particular had been
elevated by the primary.
Stevens Opposes Primary
“I oppose the primary system,” Mr.
Stevens told the Republicans at the
luncheon, “becaoee tne larga expense
involved endangers the freedom of
the candidate more than a regulated
convention system. It takes $60,000
to reach the voters of Minnesota with
one circular letter alone. The pri
mary prevents the calling or draft
ing a candidate and forces the se
lection to be from those who seek
office for no other reason than to
satisfy their own ideas and desires.
O’Brien County
Klan Unit Has
Complete Band
SHELDON, IA, May 6.—The O’Bri
een county Klan unit claims the first
complete hand in the state. It
will not be long until the band is
composed of 100 pieces.
The first public appearance of the
band was made recently when a large
meeting was held at Hartley near
here. There were over 700 men
present, and over 200 of them took
the obligation of citizenship in the
Invisible Empire.
On the Saturday night before Eas
ter large fiery exossea were burned in
Sheldon, Sanborn and Hartley. The
citizens of these communities know
that the Klan is active in the coun
ty. With the coming of good weath
er and an improvement in roads, it
is confidently expected by local Klan
officials that there will be great in
creases in membership. There are
many Protestant Americans through
out the county who are anxiously
awaiting the opportunity to join the
ever-growing throng of Klansmen.

Special Services Held in Many
Churches of Southern lowa
Community
FORT MADISON. IA., May 6—The
Protestant ministers of this commun
ity believe that in the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan is the one organiza
tion that will weld all Protestant
Americans in one common bond.
Recently 20 robed members of the
order visited the Santa Fe Avenue
Methodist Episcopal church and pre
sented the Rev. Mr. Whitman, pas
tor, with an envelope containing $26.
The Klansmen entered the church
from the basement as the congrega
tion was singing. They knelt in
front of the altar and participated in
prayer with the congregation and
pastor. Following the service a fi
ery cross was burned from a hilltop
on the opposite side of town.
An open meeting for the Klan was
recently held at the Christian church
by the Rev. Mr. Kindred, who came to
Fort Madison from Oklahoma. He
talked on the principles of the organi
zation. A similar meeting was helo
on a recent Sunday evening by the
Rev. Mr. Miller of the Baptist church.
Tenents of Klankraft were praised
by the minister and pointed out as
oeing principles of Americanism and
Christianity.

Klan Grows in Spite
of Much Opposition
WALNUT. KAN., May 6.- Misrep
resentation of the Ku Klux Klan in
to-called news stories and the deter
mined opposition to it were named
.is two of the reasons fof the order’s
rapid growth by a lecturer of the or
ganisation at a recent open meeting
here.
The order is not anti anything, the
weaker declared. It wants everyone
to enjoy their rights as guaranteed
under the constitution, he said. The
*i»eaker declared that many confused
the present organisation with the one
of 1M67 and pointed out that there
wee no reaeon for distrust, ae the
early organisation was not a law lees
“The primary does not give the
majority choice, and under our sys
tem without convention the candi
dates have no instruction or guide
from the voter who gives his support.
Without the platform the candidate
is not bound to any policy except
his own whim.
“The faults of the convention sys
tem were not in the idea of represen
tative action, but in the abuses that
crept in. These abuses can be, and
were, corrected by the 1921 conven
tion law. While I favor the nomina
tion of congressional and state offi
cers by convention, the convention
law could be adapted as in lowa, to
nominate only when a primary can
didate had failed to win at least 35
per cent of the vote.
Convention Determines Policy
“The convention is essential to de
termine party policy and instruct
the candidates in the party as to
their course in all governmental mat
ters.
“Having the primaries held as we
do in June, the caucus should be on
the same date, the judges would be
the same, the ballots would be pre
pared in the same manner, and in
all things they would be governed by
general election laws. This means
that the county officials would certi
fy the convention roll call, and there
would be no squabbling as to seats in
the convention. I submit that this
would add no expense to the state,

RALEIGH AUDIENCE
HEARS DR. EVANS
Principles of Klankraft Ontlined
to 2IMW People in City
Auditorinm
RALEIGH, N. C., May 5 Dr. Hi
ram Wesley Evans, Imperial Wizard,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, spoke
to over 2,000 men and women in the
city auditorium here recently. He
was introduced by Judge Henry A.
Grady, Grand Dragon of North Caro
lina, who was presented to the audi
ence by Hon. Robert N. Sims of the
Raleigh bar.
Dr. Evans spoke on eu*. cation,
health, and other kindred Klan top
ics. He read from manuscript with
considerable effect, giving the poli
cies of the Klan, though that institu
tion was not mentioned by name. The
audience was composed of men and
women from all parts of the state,
the greater part being citizens of
Raleigh and community. Many of
his remarks were greeted by bursts
of applause.
On Thursday evening, Dr. Evans
addressed several hundred delegates
in the Klavern of the Raleigh Klan.
This was a most enthusiastic meeting
largely attended, and many matters
of state-wide importance were at
tended to. Judge Grady, Grand
Dragon, attended this meeting also,
where he proposed and had acted up
on a plan for propagation for the
Realm of North Caolina.
The two meetings together will
mean much for Klankraft in this vi
cinity. At no time since the Realm
was organized have so many Klans
men assembled in one place, or mani
fested so intense an interest in the
work.
It is expected confidently that this
Realm will soon take its place near
the head of the column among or
ganized states.

Protestants Are “Wise” to Per

By Newspapers
BEMIDJI, MINN.—In spite of news
paper opposition the Klan is going
forward in this community. It will
be impossible for The Pioneer to pre
vent a powerful Klan in Baltrami
county. Quickly the Protestants are
coming to realize that pernicious
propaganda is serving the interests
of foreignism and anti-Americanism.
Plans have already been completed
for activities that will mean certain
success for Klankraft in this city
and the county of which it is a part.
Klan Stimulates New
Interest in Churches
NEODESHA. KAN., May s.—With
the local Klan promoting the cause

interest in the churches here has
been displayed during the last few
weeks. Easter Sunday local churches
reported the largest Sunday school
attendance ever recorded here. The
local Klan has moved its headquar

and is making much progress. A few
months ago city officials would not

EX-POLICE CHIEF
SHOULD GO TO JAIL
John Lick of Faribault Faces
Sentence for Bootlegging
Liquor
(Kj EYKTHERE)
Friends, Americans, Klansmen, lend
me your ears:
Recently former Chief of Police
John Lick of Faribault, Minnesota,
was arrested while in the act of
transporting liquor, and when his res
idence was searched, liquor aggregat
ing twelve gallons was found.
When arraigned in justice court,
John Lick pleaded guilty to main
taining a nuisance, and w r as fined
SIOO.OO and costs. At the prelimi
nary hearing on the transportation
charges. Lick waived examination and
was taken before District Judge Fred
W. Senn and pleaded guilty. Where
upon the judge imposed a sentence of
$160.00 fine and 45 days in Rice coun
ty jail.
The jud£d s< ce has granted Mr.
Lick two stays of sentence, the last
to expire May 8, but listen, dear
reader, rumors are current that dele
gations of the bootlegger's sympa
thizers have made special trips to
Waseca and called upon His Honor
asking for lenience for Mr. Lick, and
it is further rumored that boasts
have been made that John Lifk will
never go to jail.
The citizens of Faribault, including
even some of the bootlegger’s pa
trons, are wrathy at the prospect of
a suspended sentence in Mr. Lick’s
case, and are clamoring for law and
justice to take its course. The prop
er disposal of this case will set a
precedent and admonish all officers
and representatives of the people not
to betray the public trust in the fu
ture.
The 100 per cent Americans of
Rice county and all good citizens
who want to see the constitution up
held and the laws enforced are ex
pecting a vindication of our good
judge in spite of the hypnotic efforts
of the un-American element.

Former Attorney General Daugherty

preparing to force a showdown on
the issue. The committee will chal
lenge his authority to stop examina
tion of his private telegrams and
will ask Attorney General Stone to

Mr. Daugherty has filed suit in the
district supreme court against the
Brookhart committee, the sergeant
at-arms of the senate and the West
ern Union and Postal Telegraph com
panies to prevent them from continu
ing the investigation. While the suit
is directed at the production of tel

committee’s power to investigate his
alleged faliure to prosecute anti

Sinclair and E. L. Doheny.
Committee members have been or

why injunctions should not be issued.
Senators Brookhart and Wheeler are
considerably aroused over the suit.

PRICE FIVE CENTS
TO SETTLE
MAYFIELD
CASE NOW
Senate Committee Could Ar
rive at Legal Decision
at Once, if It Desires
BASED ON CHALLENGE
Attorney W. F. Zumbrann for
Tens Senator Brings Up
Startling Point
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 2.
A plea for immediate decision on
the contested election of Senator
Mayfield of Texas, was made be
fore the special senate commit
tee trying the charges by W. F.
Zumbrunn, of Kansas City, May
field’s attorney.
Zumbrunn declared that if it de
sired, the committee could determine
the case within three days. He add
ed that Senator Mayfield was anx
ious for a speedy settlement of the
case.
‘The recount of the election is be
fore the senate,” Zumbrunn said.
“If the challenged votes are not tak
en into consideration it shows that
Mayfield is elected three to one. The
question now is to decide whether
the challenges are legal. The com
mittee can do this within three days
without necessity of calling witness
es. If you decide the challenges as
made by Peddy’s attorneys are not
legal, then Mayfield is duly elected
senator and that is all there is to it.”
Luther Nichols, counsel for G. E.
B. Peddy, who was defeated by May
field and contested the election,
urged that the committee press its
investigation by calling witnesses
and wait until the census bureau has
completed its tabulation of the re
count before deciding the legality of
the challenges.
“If the contention of the contest
ant (Peudy) as to the ballots that
were challenged for technical reasons
is tenable, that ends the case and we
don’t have to go into anything,” said
Zumbrunn. “We can decide that, a
question of law, in three days' time,
and not subpoena a single witiness”
Opposing Zumbrunn’s move, Nich
ols said: “the big question now is
whether there was a violation of the
corrupt practice act, and if so,
what penalty ought to be applied.”
All of which shows that Peddy’s at
torneys jump from one thing to an
other before settling any one thing
definitely.
Klan Lecturer
Cheered at Wahkon
WAHKON. MINN., April 26.—Al
though rain had continued all day
and showed no signs of a let-up when
evening approached, the people of
this community filled a local hall
where a Klan lecture was advertised.
When the national Klan lecturer ap
peared he was cheered. The concen
sus of opinion seems to be that the
lecture was one of the best ever
heard in this part of the state for
many a day. Many around here have
already signified their willingness to
Ktition for membership in the Ku

This meeting resulted in a material

Frame-up on Alleged
Klansman by Aliens
Falls Through
CI-ARKSBURG, W. VA., May 6.
A can of milk and a handful of
aliens nearly cost C. C. Lanham,
Stealey Heights, car inspector for
the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, his
job.
The aliens, who are Lanham’s
fellow workers, thought that Lan
ham was a member of the Ku
Klux Klan it is said. Tuesday some
of Lanham’s enemies saw a can
of milk in his locker at the local
Baltimore & Ohio freight station.
They immediately notified a rail
road policeman who placed Lan
ham under arrest charging him
with stealing the commodity.
Lanham was brought before Mag
istrate Huery Alexander, where he
was given a hearing on charge of
pilfering interstate shipments. At
the hearing, however, J. R. Chal
fant, manager of a local Piggly
Wiggly store, West Pike street,
testified that he sold Lanham the
can of milk that day. Chalfant
remembered Lanham on account
of the two men being friends.
The case was dismissed.
It is believed by many that !t
