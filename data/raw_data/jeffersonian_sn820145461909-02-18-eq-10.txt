Sketches from Roman History
The warfare that is being carried on
today against class legislation has
aroused a keen interest in this little
book, in which Mr. Watson deals with
the heroic land reformers of Rome,
the great slave revolt, the tribune of
the people, the brilliant leader of the
aristocrats, and other dramatic scenes
in the history of Rome.

THE SON OF A MAN WITH
BRAINS.
(Continued from Page Three.)
Riggs/’ he said, and hurried away.
Rig’gs went to the mining office.
The door was open. He entered. In
the two hours he had left the
clerks, officials,' typewriters, desks and
tables—alf' had disappeared.
In a cab he dashed back to the
hotel.
The nurse, the solemn physician,
the dying old man—vanished.
And the reputable young Mr. Riggs
tore his hair.
This story I had straight from Tip
ton’s lawyer. The trap had been pre
pared carefully, by weeks of hard
daily work. Tipton’s life was a string
of such stories. In twelve years he
piled up some ten hundred thousand.
He is now in Sing Sing.—LaFollette’s.
A GOOD WORD FOR THE NIGHT
RIDERS.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson,
Ga.
Dear Sir: The way seems very dark
to me. What does the present state of
affairs prove if it doesn’t prove that
the people have lost confidence in the
administration of the government?
They are ready now for anything that
will bring a change. If there isn’t
something done pretty soon to bring
relief to the people by the administra
tion the people will do more than ride
at night. Night riding is all wrong;
striking is all wrong; rape is all
wrnog; the rich plundering the poor is
all wrong. If the government will as
sert herself and pass such laws as will
protect the laboring people you will
hear of no more night riding nor
strikes. Otherwise, it will grow worse
and worse. I see some of the govern
ors are saying that it shall be put
down.if it takes every militiaman in
the state. I should not like to be in his
shoes when he undertakes the job.
It is like a man trying to purify a
fountain by cleaning the stream below.
The proper way is to go to the foun
tain head= Some are branding those
men as outlaws; they are not outlaws
in the true sense of the word. They
are simply rebelling against the ac
tion of a certain class of men that are

You will find as good, law-abiding men
in those night riders as you will find
in the community in which they live.
How can you get a jury to condemn
such men? The Good Book tells us
that when the vilest men are exalted
the wicked walk on every side. Our
trouble is that the moral law is ig
nored. We have drifted away after
other gods. The god of mammon.

PITTSBURG AND THE NEGRO.
It appears that the people of Pitts
burg are having serious trouble with
the negroes of that city. The criminal
element of the blacks have been at
tacking white girls on the streets and
have created much indignation and
antagonism. The feeling is evi
dently becoming bitter, and the local
press is suggesting drastic methods for
stopping the evil.
Commenting on the situation, the
Pittsburg Post says:
“If the city is to be rid of the
scourge of negroes who attack or en
deavor to attack women and girls,
drastic punishment must be meted out
to such as come within the toils of the
law. If'evidence is strong enough to
fix guilt upon the accused, the ex
tremes! penalties should be invoked.
It will not do to accept the flimsy ex
cuses and evasions pleaded by some
of these. Every case ought to be
probed to the bottom in order that
full justice may be done and lest some
of the offenders should prevail with a
plausible pretext. If there is to be
a leaning one way or the other, it
should be in the direction of severity
rather than leniency.”
This is not surprising. It will be
noted that the Post hints at the most
severe punishment for the offenders.
It is the same old story. With any
thing like the same conditions the
people of Pittsburg would look at the
situation just as the people of the
South do. It lias been the history of
the negro movement to the North and
whenever the blacks collect there in
large numbers, the feeling of the
whites assumes a very much more an
tagonistic attitude than is entertained
in the South towards the negroes by
the whites.
It takes a large exodus of the ne-
