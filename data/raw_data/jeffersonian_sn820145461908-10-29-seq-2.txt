WILLIAM JRNNINGS BRYAN
It is strongly in my mind that Mr.
Bryan would make a worst possible
President. Not that he lacks the wit;
his great want is pure courage. Once
in the White House, his next day’s
desire would be a re-election; and
after that, his selfish timidities would
palsy him for anything like generous
presidential effort.
No, forsooth; it calls fpr no mighty
wit to be a good President. But
there are dragons to be met withal.
These, if not squarely in the way,
may be relied upon as ferociously up
the side streets. All that an evil
intelligence, backed by money as
evil, can do will be done toward ter
rorizing and turning back a Presi
dent who heads for popular good.
Those forces have been found power
ful enough to mold the strongest in
their hours, and Mr. Bryan, ham
pered and weakened by his hopes of
a re-election, would not be found so
indomitable, not to say so ironbound,
as to withstand them.
At the close of my last story, I had
got Mr. Bryan into the House and
onto the Ways and Means, the latter
because of his wasted speakership
vote and his deal with the friends of
Mr. Crisp. As he took his House
seat, that wasted caucus vote in no
wise troubled Mr. Bryan. What cared
Mr. Bryan?
Tariff and Silver, in their future
House expressions, would follow that
speakership as a tail follows a kite.
What then? Mr. Bryan must think
of himself. And so he had thrown
himself away on Mr. Springer —
thrown himself away in a battle that
meant millions to the public.
The mystery of that wasted Bryan
vote rode me like a nightmare. For
it was my newspaper business to un
ravel it, and those were days when I
knew less than I do now. Wherefore,
when chance offered, I asked him
those questions touching his reasons
for that wasted vote, as I’ve already
recounted.
That question-putting came about
easily enough. I ran onto Mr. Bryan
in the lobby back of the House. He
was beaming, with a suave, oily
satisfaction that is still much at
home on his face.
Commonly a man is most frank
when most pleased with himself. In
surly moments he turns silent, secret,
suspicious. The time was ripe and
right to take up that great caucus
Bryan mystery.
Wherefore I flung my question at
him; wherefore he flung me his reply.
Facing an “old soldier element along
the Platte.” he must heedfully save
his skirts from every “ex-Confed
erate” stain. Having answered me,
he walked away, not without a self
sufficient switch to his young coat
tails, as being the coat tails of one
who had solved his whole future, and
settled it in favor of an uninterrupted
political success. I got the impres
sion from the incident, an impres
sion never to be effaced, that Mr.
Bryan was without question the
greatest and most important splinter
of the universe—to Mr. Bryan. He
had entered Congress thinking of
naught save himself; and so true to
first impulse did he run, that never
for one moment during the four
years of his service was he found to
forget himself for any other man or
thing. He was his own idol, ever on
his knees to that idol.
Friendship, party loyalty, public
duty, all things else might perish
from the hillside of his regard; but
never “Bryan.” Party might go
down, public good might founder
beneath his feet; let him but get
“Bryan” ashore on a hatch-cover
and he could readily be consoled. He
was immensely, intensely for
“Bryan,” and to serve his own
hopes, accommodate his own fears, he
stood ready to go through public
interest like a cow through a cobweb.
He was selfish with the selfishness of
an oyster, and congenitally incapa
ble of any good save his own. He is
all these things today. To boil his
own egg he would burn another’s
barn. If he owned a lake he
wouldn’t give a duck a drink.
In Mr. Bryan’s favor as he entered
the House ran various character
istics. He was fluent, plausible, of a
pleasant, confidential address that
had the effect of flattery upon his
hearers. He had no tempers, gave
way to no angers, was consumed of
the flames of no rages. He had no
gratitudes, no revenges. Likewise,
gratitude and revenge are twins;
they are off the same bolt of cloth,
and mean but a payment of one’s
debts, for good or ill, when all is
said. I say that he owned no re
venges. If he had any they belonged
with the furtive, the indirect, and
were of the sort that express them
selves with poison, not the battle
axe. These things was Mr. Bryan, as
he sat those four years in the House;
and, since men in their elements
never change, he is all these things
today.
To succeed as Mr. Bryan has suc
ceeded —for he has had success —he
must be a matchless deceiver.
Now and then, in a heat of selfish
ness, he will outrun his native cau
tion, and give the world a briefly
vanishing glimpse of his inner ugli
ness. This was the case when
he did all he disgracefully might
to possess himself of the Con
necticut widow’s fifty thousand
dollars. The bait was too strong;
it drew him for the moment out
side of himself. The yellow glint of
those fifty thousand dollars blinded
his eyes, commonly keen enough, and
he failed to see how public indigna
tion would pile itself up. Thus was
he betrayed into that attempted pil
lage, and showed himself willing to
strip a woman to feather his own
mean nest. One day I shall write
more fully of that widow’s mite
which Mr. Bryan did not receive.
There you have, in contracted
measure, a fraction of what I think
of Mr. Bryan. The reason of its
telling is that at this precise writing
he goes building his fences, and lay
ing his pipes for the capture of the
Presidency. He asks to be your
President, as he has twice asked be
fore. It is judicious, therefore, to
take a close, sure look at him.
Above I have given with a free
hand my estimates of Mr. Bryan. Let
me go back to December, 1891, and
take up Mr. Bryan on the floor of the
House.
Mr. Bryan prepared his orations
15 Jeffersonian
with tenderest solicitude, and never
went off at rhetorical half-cock. Also,
he was carefully conventional and
usual, and shunned originality as he
would have shunned the plague. To
succeed in politics, one must be of
the herd, and the herd distrusts the
original. Knowing this, Mr. Bryan
never permitted himself to overflow
into aught that was novel, whether of
idea or phrase. He carefully thought
nothing that hadn’t been thought,
said nothing that hadn’t been said,
saw nothing that hadn’t been seen,
did nothing that hadn’t been done.
But what he did think and say and
see and do, he thought, said, saw and
did plausibly, smoothly and with
polished grace. He had a voice, too,
like a chime of bells, and in his
manner there abode no jarring note
of discord.
Mr. Bryan served two terms in Con
gress. His specialty was Tariff; he
paid no mighty heed to Silver. This
was not because of any Silver indif
ference; it was due to Mr. Bland, who
was Silver’s standing champion. Mr.
Bland resented, with the jealousy of
a lover, the slightest effort on any
one’s part to share his place with
him.
It thus befell that Mr. Bryan,
during his stay in Congress, never
took an important part in Silver’s
battles. Indeed, he knew so little of
Silver, in the forensic sense, that
when he was nominated for the
Presidency in 1896 he had instantly
to go to school in that economy to
Silver’s pastmaster Senator Jones’
of Nevada. That Silver speech of
acceptance which Mr. Bryan read at
Madison Square Garden, was said by
good authority to be Senator Jones’
speech, not Mr. Bryan’s. Mr.
Bryan at the time explained that he
read it because a hostile goldbug
press would else misquote and malign
him. This was a splendid explana
tion, but a long flight-shot from the
truth. There is reason for believing
that he read it because, not knowing
a word of it, and the time being too
short to commit it to memory, he .
couldn’t deliver it on more flowing
terms.
Having been beaten for his third
election, Mr. Bryan’s House activi
ties were scheduled to end March,
1895. Wherefore—loth to face an
officeless future —in his last Con
gress Mr. Bryan resolved to make a
plunge for the next Nebraska Sena
torship, and make it as a Populist.
This wouldn’t have been so reprehen
sible, except that as a first step he
dealt with Sugar.
The Wilson Bill was in the Senate,
and the Oxnards of Nebraska beet
sugar celebration, and per incident an
important element of the Sugar
Trust, were full of tariff fears. With
Senator Hill, of New York, voting
all around the tariff clock, and laying
it to an income tax, the Senate line
ups on Sugar were so even that a
single vote could win or lose the
Sugar day.
The Oxnards made their deal with
Mr. Bryan. He delivered to them
that required one vote in the shape
of “Talkforever” Allen of his State.
Mr. Bryan took Mr. Allen away from
Mr. Pence and Mr. Simpson and
their fellow Populists, and held him
By Alfred Henry Lelvis
fast for Sugar through a hundred
Senate roll calls. Mr. Allen’s was
that Senate vote for which the
hunted interests of Sugar were look
ing. The trust had panted for that
vote as the worn hart panteth for the
water-brook, and Mr. Bryan found it.
Not only did he find it, but day after
day he left his seat in the House and
went to the Senate, there to stand
faithful Sugar watch and ward over
the large, but uncertain, Senator
Allen.
What was to have been his re
ward ?
In event of a favorable Sugar up
come, and the sticking of Senator
Allen to the Sugar last, Mr. Bryan,
by promise of the Oxnards, would
have received a Sugar boost up the
Senate stairs. The intrigue went
astray. The unfortunate Senator
Allen, harried by every Populist
paper between the coast lines of the
country, fell into a frenzy of fear and
wriggled through the Bryan fingers.
Thus the Senate in the last of it did
not jump Sugarwise. Neither did Mr.
Bryan receive that Sugar boost.
While that new fit of Populism—
he had in 1892 voted for General
Weaver, the Populist candidate for
the Presidency—was upon him, Mr.
Bryan nearly made a false step.
Had he taken it, his “cross of gold”
—now abandoned —would not have
won him that Chicago nomination.
He would have been once more with
Messrs. Watson, Simpson and Pence,
and never have come to Chicago at
all.
Governor O’Ferrell, of Virginia,
then a member of the House, had
been slated for the Governorship of
his State. Mr. Bryan, with no
principle to guide by beyond the
selfish principle of his own advance
ment, was as aforesaid swinging in
his painful allegiance between the
Populists and the Democrats. As
though having finally decided into
whose arms to fall, he made arrange
ments with a Roanoke delegation to
stump Virginia for the Populists
against Mr. O’Ferrell.
The latter gentleman heard of it
and asked Mr. Bryan if the tale were
true. Mr. Bryan was disturbed. His
eyes shifted hither and yon, like
those of a trapped animal. He said
that “he hadn’t made up his mind.”
“Well, sir,” returned Mr. O’Fer
rell in a high vein, “when you do
make up your mind, I trust that
you’ll let me know. Should you, sir,
who pretend to be a Democrat, come
into my State to stump for the Popu
lists, I shall be there to meet you.
And I promise you a reception
worthy your merits in every last
particular. ’ ’
Mr. Bryan did not stump Virginia
for the Populists, but crept sidewise
out of his pact.
Toward the close of Congress he
considered within himself how he
might prevail upon the propaganda
to put him, Mr. Bryan, forward as
Silver’s Independent candidate for
the White House. Saying no word —
for Mr. Bryan is a profound be
liever in surprises and has lifted
stampede to the plane of art —he
suddenly arose one evening in the
midst of that propaganda, and burst
