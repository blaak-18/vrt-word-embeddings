Our Nomuinees.
The gre:at National convention
of the People's j~rty has leen hell.
Over 1I1() delegates represent- 1
ing every State and Territory in
the Union save Alaska, and com- t
posed of at least a part of the best
n talent and energy in the party, and
as good as there are in America t
to-day, was assemn)led.
There were differences of opin
ion there as to the proper course
for the party. Nearly all the old t
leaders and the machinery of the c
party were on one side backed by
a goodly following, a great deal of
talent and much of the logic of the
situation.
Against this came the rank and I
file, or the "Middle of the Roaders"
and for 4 days the battle raged.
The contest was so evenly divided
. that first one side, then the other
had the advantage.
r What the Bryan and Sewall side c
would have done toward concilia
tion and party harmony if they (
had been successful, we are una
ble to say, but when the "Middle ]
of the Roaders" had won the order
' of business, reversed it and nomi
nated Watson for Vice-President,
I they extended the olive branch and
r exepted Bryan, to appease the'
I West.
So the great People's party re
mains whole when all others are di- t
Slided, and as both the old parties a
' are abusing It for what it did at
, St. Louis, it is fair to presume <
, that it did the right thing.
We have asked but few conees- ]
sions of the Democrats for our
9,000,000 votes. Yet without them 4
silver cannot win. (
The responsibility therefore rests ]
L with the Democrats, if they will [
make no concessions after the pa- ;
triotism of other parties and men ]
of all other parties, then they are
not sincere in their fight for silv r.
Han. Thos. E. Watson sent the
following dispatch to the New
York World, on July 96th, in an
swer to certain questions :
First-I will ran the race to the
sad.
Second-I will make the contest e
evea if Mr. Sewall does not return. i

n When Tho.. E. Watson was an
a. nounctd as the nominee for vice
t- president in the convention the
in hands on the clock pointed at 14;
to 1.
id In seconding Watson's nominn
[ tion Judee Gunby on behalf of the
Louisiana delegation made a deci
. ded "hit." His four minute speech
) set the convention wild with en
Id thusiasm, and before he knew it
1e delegates had him on their should
,y ers parading the aisles.

r. Louisiana crated another pleas
ing episode in the St. Louis eon
ce vention by asking that her 5 min
u utes time to second the nomination
'- of William J. Bryan, be taken by
" Mrs. Minerva Roberts, of the Col
u erado dolegation, which occupied
. seats jiat across the aisle from Lou
i. isiann. The pretty little woman in
a sweet cieas voice made one of the
- best speeches of the convention.

next weak.

Cleveland for Nominuee 'rohalile.
- Washington, I). C., July 23, 189g.
e At this writing the Populist con
vention is still in session, so I d1
not know where we are at. I do
h know, however. that the gold Dem
- ocrats in Washington are greatly
t interested in the outcome of the
deliberations of the Populists. In
administration c~rcles it is general
ly understood that it the People's
party indorses Bryan, the gold
D)emocrats will vote for McKinley,
If it nominates a separate ticket,
then the gold Democrats will hold
a convention and put up Grover
Cleveland.
It is most irritating to read the
accounts of the People's party conl
vention published in the Eastern
subsidized daily papers. The Wash.
- ington Post said of the delegates :
"Out of every county in the South
and every township in the West
there seemed to have been sifted
out every crank, every uman of wild
i ideas and still wilder appearance,
They were all men of low degrees,
with ill fitting clothes and count
enances marked with the scears of
many battles with the world.
"One thing about the personnel
of the convention was remarkable.
Nearly all of the delegates were
old men-men with long gray strag
gling beards and long gray hair.
The convention seemed to be, in
fact, one enormous aggregation of
life failures. This was the pitiful
part of it. It was plain to see that
- these men are the Micawbers and
the Jingles of actual life, all going
down the hill of life with nothing
gained in the past and nothing to
hope for in the future. All of them,
m or nearly all of them, were drown
ing men grasping at straws."
The New York World said:
S"The sun grew hotter and hotter,
and the wild ass of the mountains
and the coyote of the prairie bray
ed and yelped in unison. The vast
hall was full of whiskers. It was
degeneration howling for regenera
tion."
Other pagers said that every face
in the convention was asymmetri
cal; that there was not one which
did not show signs of moral degene
ration, of laziness, and dishonest
intent.
Being personally acquainted with
many of the delegates, -being a
Western man myself, and knowing
the sturdy honesty of the Western
tarmers and Jouthern planters who
have endured spoliation for years
rather than resist the usurers ana
monopolists by any other than con
I stituttonal means, such deliberate
lies, such shocking insults to all in
s:ed class of people make my blood
boil. I wonler how your "teuders
appreciate thewn I believe that
the insulting tone of the subsidised
ress is part of the soheme, of which
I wrote last week, to exasperate
the people, to provoke riots and
thus frighten away from the reform
cause-the tmid people. We shall
ase. There never was a brighter
cutleok for the eause of reflrm, and
I only hope that next year the
House of beptreautatives may be
flled with the men whom the Mast
ern papers now delight to insult.

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funnmy and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trl's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers.
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
; 4iraydy sh..Id Read It.
It contains 176 paces of laugh
provoking matter, adl 40 full-pare
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
