FRIDAY, January 29, 1897.
Ex. Congressman 1W'. A. Halr
ris, Populist, has been elected to
succeed Senator Peffer of Kansas.
The Drl-nmmers of the State are,'
getting lip 3 car loads of provis
ions and clothes for the drouth suf
fers of Grant, Winn and Jackson
parishes. May heaven bless their
noble generosity.
Every Populist editor in Lou
isiana should attend the National
Reform Press Association meeting
at Memphis, on February 22nd.
The future policy of qur party
will doubtless t~ shapew! there.
In its efforts to relieve the starv
ing drouth victims in Grant parish,
the Daily Item of New Orleans.
and its friends, sent two car loads
of meal, flour, bacon and other
food, and a big lot of clothing,
flannel, etc., on a special train,
which reached Pollock Monday
last, and was a veritable God send
to the famished people who receiv
ed it with shouts of joy.
The Bodcan Lumber Company
have reached the northwestern bor
der of our parish, with their stand
ard pgage railroad and will push
it, we are told, rapidly south to
intersect the yellow pine road at
Minden Junction; from thence to
Cousbatta. This road will give
our people a direct roaen to St.
Louis by New Louisville, Ark.,
and open un the resources of a
part of the country that has been
for a long time mn the background.

Hot. HI. L. Brian, bChairman State
Central Committee:
All the rest of the six congres
slonal districts having been heard
from by "freight," I wish to an
swer for one of the many congres
sional districts that fail to respond
to thie Populist roll call when the
smoke of the battle hats cleared
away.
It may be a cdue by which the
missing millions of honest voters
aa be saved.
The Weaver campaign was a
doie of Republican fusion that
hrly id the People's party in
tbsfheSeond district.
All that could be done in my
power, and that of a few others to
resusctate the patient, culminated
in i Labor movement in '94.
With renewed effort in the State
ampaign, we were again discon
- eeted and demoralized by Repub
liean fusion on a plan that mintend
-ed the boomingof the Populist
ticket in North Louisiana, and the
Republican ticket in South Lou
isian, tothat extent that with all
thepromise, there was not one
Popisbtt tket to be had in this
dIInet, except at this single poll,
A e rally was ide on Debs,
or aie other equalyasgood Pop
ullst Then the St. Louis conven
tion disgusted us ail.
To arovete wreck we run out
two nomination papers for lists of
•' 1 .es I persohaIly secured nine
Sty-onein a week, and with fifteen
o the other, the required one huh
died, thp rei~tatl, oicer po
litly sat down on it. "The insur

Backsliding.
We never did have much confi
dence in the conversion of the En
terprise and its immediate friends
to the cause of free silver. 'lThev
had been too ardent :ldmirers of
Grover ClevelWlnd and( his policy,
up to the very time that their of
fices were in danger. They were
0 as willin, that the people should
he rolbbed through the gold stand
arnd as Grover Was, hut they lack
- ed the consistency and nerve to
stand by their principles in the face
0of defeat.
So they flopped in good time to
fool some of the people in Natchi
toches p)arish, and by that aInd
other foul means secure another 4
Syear's lease on the offices which
are so necessary to their existence.
But now, since they feel com
e paratively secure for another four
years, they are pavinz the way to
' another flop, this time Iackward,
to their old position in favor of
the gold standlard. lHlnce, we find
the following in the Enterprise of
last week, under the heading of
"The McKinley Administration":
The tariff issue cut but a sorry
figure in the late campaign. it
was entirely oversh:alowed by the
currency question and the some
what novel, if not dangerous, poli
cies propounded by the 1)emocrat
ic party in its platform and which
for the time, impressed the con
,servative people of the country
with the idea that it would not be
safe to trust the administration of
this great government to a party
which so suddenly turned its back
upon most of its old and trusted
leaders and took counsel of the
niost radical of its members.
So according to the Enterprise
now, the free silver of the Chicago
plaforni was "novel, if not danger
aerous," and the Democratic par
ty, by advocating free silver, had
"turned its back upon most of its
old and trusted leaders (Carlisle
and Cleveland) and took counsel of
the most, radical of its members,
(Bryan and others).
We contended all alone that the
Enterprise and its backers were
not honest in their support of free
silver, but there were many honest
silver men in this parish fooled by
them into staying with the Iknmo
cratic party and voting said Enter
prise and its friends back into of
fice, and they can now go out and
kick themselves.
