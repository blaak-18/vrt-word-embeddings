That the rum runners and bootleg

AWAKENING AMERICA
Youngstown, Ohio, one of Ohio’s
fairest cities, which not so long ago
was run officially by aliens who de
lighted in public insults to Ameri
cans, has awakened. Indeed times
have changed since the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan aroused the Amer

a cleanup politically and now Ameri

city’s affairs for Americans. Noth

changed conditions than an incident
which took place in the office of the
school board recently, when a beauti
ful American flag was presented to
the board and officially accepted by
the members. The occasion was one
of unusual interest. The presenta

Rooted in the fertile past;

Of the lair, and cave, and den,
Cleanse the dragon, shine of nature—

Men whose moral currents sweep
Toward the wide-infolding ocean
Of an undiscovered deep:
Men who feel the strong pulsation
Of the central sea, and then

WHY HOMED TOE ID (UK KUM
By a Presbyterian Minister—U. S.
Branch.
(Tennessee Fiery Gross.)
My father was mated in the Seced
er church. It is a branch of the Pres
byterian* family of jyhuiehoe*—lt-oaoe*
opposed secret I grew'Vp and
probably absorbed that disposition
though I never heard it discussed.
I wanted to join the Masons but
waited twenty years before putting in
my application. I suspect the reason
was the influence of my father's un
spoken views.
Hence I had a struggle to join any
secret order, Mason or what not. But
I am a student of history—this said
modesty. I studied in the university
where I remained a total of seven
years, something of history and have
kept it up somewhat. Its lessons are
dear, if you give them time to sink
m.
The Renaissance, which began in
Italy in the Middle age 3 was at first
endorsed by the popes. They helped
to forward the movement and gave
aid in collecting old manuscripts,
survivals of the B. C. period. But
when a man from Germany, named
ReuchHn came over into Italy and
carried back into Germany the seeds
of the revival of learning, which is
called the Renaissance, and there gave
it a scriptural turn, then the popes
saw that a revival of scripture study
would challenge their authority as
God’s alone spokesman in the world of
religion, and they accordingly re
pudiated the new learning and made
war in the printing press, which is
the back bone of Protestantism.
I have no great criticism on the
Papal church for its union of church
and state in the dark ages. It was p
ground hog care. “Root hog or die."
That was the situation. Indeed I will
concede that under the then present
condition, it was humaniy speaking,
necessary.
I can only say, may we as Protes
tant people never find ourselves a
small oasis of religion in a world
desert of heathenism. You do not
know what you would do.
Did not the Protestant system in
the late war gear up to beat Ger
many? Certainly. But after the
“war” was over, we did not continue
along that line, but quietly went back
to our knitting. True our gearing
up was not the demand of the state
to use its energies to make good any
ecclesiastical program and was not
union of church and state at all in
the real meaning of the terms.
To be liberal, had the popes after
quitely gone back to church matters,
we would have no great quarrel with
them. But they inheriting the throne
of the Ceasars, proceeded to demand
all power both ecclesiastical and
secular and yet, killing those who
oppose them, and claim the state is
but the servant of the church, and the
sword, the pope's means of exter
minating heresy, a heretic being any
and all who oppose the Roman sys
tem.
Is a sheriff a cold-blooded monster
because he hangs -a man. No, He
is my agent, and is no more guilty
of murder in the hanging, than I am
in voting for him as sheriff knowing
that duty inheres in the office. But
the man who opposes capital punish
ment on any and all grounds, would
consistently pronounce him a monster.
It is therefore a question of view
point.
Is the Jesttft order composed of
monsters because they as the agency
of the Roman system endorse a war
of extermination on all heretics? By
no means along all ordinary lines, a
Jesuit may be a most elegant gentle
man. But he believes in the sword
as a means of propogating religion,
and I do not. “He that sword," said
he who spake as never man spoke.
It is a question of viewpoint, and
as I do not propose to have my head
cut off because I am a Presbyterian,
I propose to clip the wings of those
who would clip my head if they could.
Why has Protestant Europe expell
ed the Jesuit order, entirely or in part,
thirty-nine different times ? the
matter is food for thought.
Why has intellectual and spiritual
rot been the rule in every nation con
trolled by Rome? Why has illiteracy
and illegitamacy been so prevalent?
The Protestant reformation in Eu
rope gave birth to the political revolu
tion, now known in the world as
Democracy. Get down your Myer’s
History, the kind taught in Hie public
schools. Its second main division in
the Table of contents is “The Modern
Age." That in turn has two sub
divisions. One is the aforesaid Reli
gious reformation, -the other, a conse
quent of the former is Hie advent of
Democracy. The very fact of Modern
Democracy, with its collaries, such as
a public school system, etc., can not
be explained by assuming them as re
sults of the said revival of religion,
attendant on the fact of a printing
press.
The point is, a real revival of re
ligion, it being but a closer approach
to God, necessarily involves a re-ad
justment of the relations of men to
e ch other, and the latter involves hu
man government—hence politics.
Therefore, we may expect as an ab
solute certainty, that from Hme to
Hmt as Protestantism takes on new
life, and gets new viewpoints, we
may expect I eay, its political mani
festations. The latest js the Ku Klux
Ban,
Was Protestantism and Democracy
welcomed in Bumps at tint? If so,
how do you explain the Mayflower,
and St. Bartholomew's day, the Span
hounded*to the .jjepJ.h, orJtha£. was tljfr
purpose ’of Chose _ who controlled.*.’ *
At each' new birth of Protestant
ism, we may expect the same efforts.
The methods will differ, but the pur-*
pose will be the same.
In a free country, and with ill in
tent toward none, it is difficult to
make people realise the price of the
freedom we have and the necessity
to fight for it
Rome now fights us with our own
weapons. The printing press is her
weapon, and education of her own
kind is being offered us. Will you see
the point?
“aEo; in our church, we have an an
nual sermon, entitled Reformation
Day. The purpose of it is to keep
alive the principles of Protestantism.
Luther and Calvin did not repudiate
the legitimate child of their teaching
so, far as they were permitted to see
that child, but welcomed him by faith
though he was brought to the birth
after their death. So I as a humble
and modern follower of heirs, will
not repudiate the revival of Protes
tantism in the realm of state, known
as the Ku Klux Klan, but will frank
ly acknowledge that I as his father,
and will seek to train him so he may
be worthy of his heritage.
If there were no foreign element in
our nation, I would strongly incline
to the opinion that the Ku Klux Klan
was a sign of decay in the entire Pro
testant fabric. It would seem like try
ing to dq by the ballot what should
be done by the gospel. But under
present condition, I strongly incline
to the opinion that it marks & real
revival in the fabric of Protestantism,
and indicates an awakening of those
who need to be awakened to the evils
present and most important of all to
those yet tQ come, unless we are wise.
Mr. Wilson §aid he believed in a
government for all the people, but
administered by Democratic hands.
Could he say less ? I believe in
toleration to all, but in the power
being safely landed in Protestant
hands. Protestantism could not per
secute if it wanted to, but it has the
right to say others not so minded,
“You shall not persecute."
I am advised that all Masonic
lodges are now closed in Hungary.
Our leaders in my church sound the
call loudly, that in the new shuffle of
national cards in Europe, Protestant
ism is in danger of annihilation in
some countries. After the splendid
work of the Y. M. C. A. in Belgium,
the pope pronounces it anathema.
The same gentleman would drive the
Methodist church out of Italy. I
strongly suspect that the Roman sys
tem is now trying to annihilate the
Greek Catholic church in Russia. It
is a splendid chance.
Do these facts, some actual, some
only potential, make you thinlr?
Yes, I expect first class squabbles
within the Ku Klux Klan itself. The
normal state of a republic is that of
a squabble. It is the price of liberty.
The blessing of liberty is, all can talk,
its course seeks sometimes to be that
all do talk. I expect our enemies to
try to plant men, who are capable,
and to seek to work them through to
high position, so as to lead off section
after section of the Kan, thus divid
ing and hence weakening. Any first
class legitimate squabble will merely
be a sign of growth. A frisky mule
colt, that jumps the fence Will make
the best mule.
But, as long as we have unde
sirables in the state, church, etc., a
few in the Ku Klux Klan will make
no difference.
Last In Washington, there is a
statue of a Presbyterian minister. So
useful was he in the year ef the re
volution, that Congress erected to him
a statue. Three miles from Char
lotte, N. C., lies the body of Alexander
Craighead. Twenty-eight men, most
ly trained by him, signed the Meck
lenburg Declaration of Independence,
These men saw and endorsed the idea,
that Protestantism must have politi
cal phases in the state. Hence the
honor paid them.
I really believe Hmt the blood of
the martyrs is the seed of the church,
and that an ora of killing of Protes
tants would revive Protestantism.
But, I lack the nerve to offer myself
as a sacrifice. Having a Protestant
government, what is the harm in try
ing to uphold it?
This article is unsolicited, and gives
my individual views of the master in

stituted under the leadership of offi
cers of Federal prohibition forces.
For over a fortnight Williamson
county had endured a reign of terror,
with armed bands of Ku Klux Klans
men and unlabeled hooligans, enroll
ed as prohibitionists deputies, shoot
ing up suspected premises, driving
people from their homes, assaulting
citizens on the streets and if the re
ports are to be believed, themselves
indulging in arson and robbery. The
armament of these riotous cork-hunt
ers included machine guns, and they
were led by a notorious man-killer
who seems to have had his authority
from Washington direct. This ele
vation of the Klan to the position of
an official fascist organization, char
tered to shoot law and order into a
community, is a highly interesting
and novel political development. Ap
parently the normal processes of
blackmail and violence incidental to
the “enforcement” of the prohibition
law are to be re-enforced by the bru
talities of Ku Klux Kluxism.’
“The ‘reign of terror’ referred to
above existed only in the imagina
tion of the sheriff and the law break
ers whose business was being ‘inter
fered with.’ The rest of the article
is so maliciously false that a denial
is not necessary. Every citizen of
the county, whether law-abiding or
lawless, knows the above is untrue in
every particular. Decent citizens
cannot conceive why a publication de
voted to telling the truth should
make such charges without investi
gation; why they should take the
word of lawless persons who are suf
fering the penalty for their acts, as
against those who are endeavoring
to clean out the place of iniquity and
make the county a decent place in
which to live. Such publications are
really obstructionists to law and or
der and encourage the lawless in
their efforts to break down the Con
stitution and overthrow the laws of
the land. The publisher of The
Freeman may have been sincere, but
the fact that he published such state
ments as the above without investi
gation would lead one to doubt his
sincerity.”

BRYAN ATTACKS MODERISM
AND EVOLUTIONISTS
New York.—William J. Bryan still
stands an unmerciful opponent to
evolution and modernism.
Religion and politics were mixed in
an address which Bryan delivered
Sunday night at the Central Presby
terian church, Brooklyn, on the sub
ject “Whether the Bible Is True."
“If the Bible is convicted of being
a man-made book, it will be a ter
rible disgrace, I am here to defend
the Bible as the work of God."
The commoner declared the first,
twenty-fourth and twenty-sixth ver
ses of Genesis proved the Bible was
the “True Word of God.”
Discussing evolution and modern
ism, he said:
“Evolution is a hypothesis that
links all living things together one
evolutionist claimed that we descend
ed from the monkey, because we re
semble that animal, and when he was
reminded that the monkey was hairy
and the human being being almost
hair less, he said the wonkey chose
the female with the least hair and
so developed a hairless race."
This argument, Bryan declared,
was abused.
Turning to modernism, he asked:
“When these men cease to believe
in God and the Bible, why don't they
quit the pulpit?
‘The Bible is either true or false,"
Bryan asserted, adding, “if it’s false,
it ought to be discarded. If it’s true,
it ought to be defended by every
Christian."
You cannot be a true Christian," he
conHnued, “unless you believe in the
divinity of Christ and the ressurec-
Hon."
