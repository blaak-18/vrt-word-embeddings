Testimony of E. L. Pierson.
Before the Con ;rAssinal Committee
Con tiuued.
petition, asking for a writ of attach.
ment. I granted the writ. And that
was the only time they recognized
we as Judlge.
Q. 1)o you still hold your commis
sion as .Jmudl ?
A. No, tho ofiee was filled at the
Inst election by the election of J. E
Hlreda,, who is una hble to hold court.
Q. By tlhe Chairman.-rThe name;
of the persons mardered, you could
not remember
A. No.
Q. During what period of time did
those murders oCCurI'
A. I know of the Coushatta affair
but that was in an adjoining parish
and the Colfax affair.
Q. You spoke of one murder that
you know of
A. Yes, but I don't say that that
was for political purposes.
Q. Has there been any other mar
der in your parish ?
A. Any murders-yes, in the va
rious portions of the parish.
Q. How much territory does that
comprise ; how many miles square 9
A. I don't know that I could say.
Q. Forty or fifty miles ?
A. , I think it is.
Q. SMr. Marshall--Did you ever
have any difference other than po
litical, with your late law partner I
A. Yes, I have, sir.
Q. Subsisting ditliculties, or old I
A. No, sir, they never can be set.
tied.
Q. By the Chairman.-Over what
period of time do those murders ex.
tend I
A. In the last year-I know of sev.
eral murders there.
Q. How many?
A. I know a man who is now in
prison here, who killed another.
Q. Was that on account of politics ?
A. I cannot say that those murders
were committed on account of poli
tics.
Q. Were they white men or coldr
ed men, that were killed I
A. I think that more colored men
have been killed than whites.
Q. Do you know of any white men
being killed by colored menat
A. Yes, I know of one instance,
that was the case of the State vs.
Wmn. Welsh and Henry Fagan. They
killed a white man named Jake
Manes.
Q. Is there any thing in these nmur
ders you speak of, within the last
two or three years that you attribute
to the existing political condition 9
A.,I cannot answer; that I don't
know.
Q. Is there anything of this kind
as tar as you know I
A. No, sir.
Q. Then as far as you know, would
the effect of those murders create
any intimidation in regard to exer
cising the right of votingon the part
of tihe colored men, unless it was
from the failure to arrest and punish 9
A. I know that there have been
murders committed, and the parties
are still at large; we are unable to
punish them; because we have no
court. The officers elected cannol
exercise the functions of their offices.
Q. The Parish Jadge; don't he have
jurisdiction in criminal cases 9
A. No, only as committing magis
trate.
Q. By Mr. Field.-II-How far is Con
shatta from your town a
A. Thirty miles.
Q. How far is Colfax I
A. Forty miles.
Q. You are familiar with those
scenes then at Coushatta and Colfax;
by reputation
A. I am not as familiar with the
Colfax affthir. I was in Natchlitoches
when the Conshatta affair occurred.
Q. Do you know whether any per
son from your parish went to Red
River parish ?
A. I know two or three started, and
got frightened and went back. One
went about twelve miles and lay out
in the woods allnight. I don't think
he was implicated in the Coushatta
affair. I don't think that any one
from our town was implicated in it.
I don't think there was a gentleman
from my town implicated in that af
fair.
Q. State what effect it had in the
parish9
A. It created a feeling of intimida.
tion throughout the parish among the
Olored people. I speak of this
knowingly, because colored people
told me that they were afraid. They
have come to me for advise, and of
ten during the campaign, asked me
what I thought about the election,
and whether they would get a chance
to vote. I told them "yes, they
would."
Q. Do you know any considerable
number ef colored people that did
not register and vote ?
A. I suppose there were about three
hundred that did not register, and
more than that who did not vote.
Q. Abot how many were there
that did not register, or did not vote
after registeriuig 9
A. I suppose-the Republican ma.
jority was twenly.sir; and in ward
4 thlere were a hundred and seventy
votes rejected, I have their eerti
feats of registration. It is endorsed
upon their papers, '"sot roted."
Q. In your opinion, from what you
know about the parish, and from
your intercourse with the voting pop
ulatiou, do you not know that the
Coushatta affair deterred the colored
people from registering and voting?
A. I think it did.
Q. Did yoea anderstand what tbis
White league was designed fort
A. No, sir.
Q. From reportst
A. No, sir, I don't know what it
was.
Q: Did you never understand It
from their- pblicationsi
A. They never published any mo
tives, except calls for meeting.
Q. 'What did they call them I
A. Mass meetings, and tax-payeis
meetings.
Q. Did you never read notices up
there of White League meetings ?
A. I only saw in the paper, "At
tention White Leagures," stating that
a meeting would be held at saelh and
such time, signed Genius, Orderly
Sergeant, and Russell, Captain.
Q. By the Chairman.--Do you
know any thing about their drilling f
A. They organized a Militia up
there under the McEnery govern
ment.
Q. Did they ever drill with arms ?
A.rNo, the only time I ever saw
them bear arms was on the 27th day
of July, the day the resignations
were demanded. I was standing next
to the President of the meeting, after
thisl resolution was adopted, that a
Committee of nine was appointed to
wait upon these gentlemen and re
quest their resignation. I heard the
President say, "Captains of compa
nies;" then he stopped and said:
"You, gentlemen, who have charge
of these men, will get them together
and keep them together. I saw five
or six companies. They formed right
in the street. They only had pistols,
however.
Q. Were these meetings opened to
the general public ?
A. No, only the members, I sup
pose.
Q. This meeting you spoke of;
how did you happen to be there t
A. This was a mass meeting on
the 27th of July, held in public.
Q. Was that held in pursuance to
a call made to the White Leagues ?
A. No, that was before the White
League was organized.
Q. Have you any knowledge of the
existence of any military organiza
tion which met in secret ?
A. The only military organization
I knew of, was the State Militia un
der Gov. McEnery.
Q. When was that organized t
A. Just after the 14th of Septem
ber, when they received instructions
to organize the Militia. Col. Burke
was made Colonel of the regiment in
Natchitoches, I believe.
Q. What effect did the formation
of these companies, or that organiza
tion have upon the colored popula
tion ?
A. Well, sir, I don't know as I
could answer that question.
Q. What effect did the expulsion of
the officers have upon the colored
population t
A. Well, they thought this: if the
leaders of the party were driven away
and could not staud the pressure,
they certainly could pot.
Q.' By Mr.Mairr.-That is your in
ference ?
A. I was told so by three or four
just before the election. They cable
to me for advice; they could not un
derstand all this.
Q. By Mr. Field.--How did Judge
Myers happen to leave there ? Do
yon know whether he was threaten
A. I don't know. He left three
days before the mass meeting. I
know it was whispered about that
they intended to ask them to resign. i
It was advocated in the paper, the
Vi.Mdietor. It came out in an ar
ticle, that the committee of seventy
should call a meeting to force the
resignation of these officers and Mr.
Myers and Mr. lienlt left before the
meeting was held.
Q. Have they ever been back there
A. Yes, Boult was Jack bat he re
signed as Parish Judge.
Q. Has Myers ever been able to go
back ?
A. I don't know whether he has
been able to go back. He has never
been back. I have heard that he
cannot get back. It is often spoken
of.
Q. Publicly 9
A. Yes, the journal advocated
hanging every Republican to a lamp
post.
Q. What paper advocated that t
A. The People's Vindiecator.
Q. What effect, in your opinion did
dall these publications have upon
the colored people in the parish 9
A. I think it had a tendency to in
timidate them.
Q. So as to preveut them from reg.
istering and voting ?
A. I know that on the day of election
several colored men voted the De
mocratic ticket, that wanted to vote
the BRepublican ticket. One was a
member of a club, an offeer of a Re
publican club. He came to me and
said, "Now I am oeempelled to vote
the Democratic ticket." "I asked
him "why." He asid, IfI done't, the
old man-meaning his employer
will just drive me away. I told him,
"Well, yonuJnst vote it, your home is
dearer to you than the party and I
think we will have enough without
your vote."
I would like to stste in regard to
thepresent condition of the parish.
The parish as reterned by the con
servative Board is Bepublican. Every
olfecer elected has been commission
ed; sand not one of them is now ex
eciaeisng the fuunetions of his offee.
At the last election two Demoeerats
6n for ofece. There was no oppe
sition to them; and they are now
seeking to get commisions fro;j the
same Exeutive that the Democrats
rIetae to recognize. But a Republi
ean cannot hold office; and 1 have
been told repeatedly that a Republi
can never should hold otee in that
parish.
Q. What Demoertats were they who
ran for ottlee
A, One ran for District Judge and
the other for DIstriet Attoerney,'
Q. And they are now otteappting
toget oommissions frolm Gov, Kel
logg t
Q. IHave you any other facts which
you wish to testify.
A. No, sir,

Q. By Mr. Pield.--What portion of

A. They raise inear;' all of it.
Q. How do the white people get

A. They own the plantations and i
employ tlheir llaborer.~.
Q. Are there aay nnumbers of col- I
ored men who arc laid ownlers 1 1
Yes, quite a nluml;er.
Q. By the chairniian:l.--How is it in
the matter of public school i
A. Well, sir, our school system is
very bad.
Q. IV hat plroportion of the clildrien
between eight andl sixteen are at
school? I
A.. IyIon'tjknow; for I don't know
how lmany schlols they 'lave. In 1
Natclitochles I know they have 'one; I
two colored and one white school. I
Q. Where do the white children
get their education ? t
A. In the parish there are some
white schools. a
Q. How are those schools support- t
ed ? I
A. By a special tax ; a school tax.
Q. Who control theml I
''A. We have a slchuol board an.di:a r
school treasltrer. The taxes are col- t
leeted by the tax collector. t
Q. Can you give any judgment
whether or not the number of chil
dren attending school is increasing p
or decreasing ? t
A. I think it is incieasing. In 1865 r
there were no colored school in the 1I
parish; and I doent know that there a
were many white schools.
Q. Are there ay coneitderble cin 1
her of ;whites that cannot read or I
write ?
A. Yes, but this is confined mostly
to the high positions. Most of the t
children in town go to private schools.
Q. By Mr. Marshall.-How long a
has this disorganized condition of t
which you speak existed in the par- ii
ish I
A. I think since last`Jnly or June ji
up to the present time.
Q. How long has this blid feeling ii
of which you spoke existed amlong
the people ?
A. Only since last July.
. Q. Before that, the parish was l
peaceable and orderly ?
A. Very peaceable.
Q. Was there any disposition before ti
that time to commit violence or in- o
tiupidation on the part of the white
people ?
A. No, sir, never.
Q. Has'nt this feeling grown out of a
the dlispllte in regard to the Kellogg II
government P
A. No, I don't think entirely ont
of that. I think it is from a disposi
tion to get office. They all wanut to tl
get ealic.
Q. Has not that disposition to get
oce existed thero before July last.
A. No, It was a hard matter to get n
a man to run for the Legislature or 0
for Sheriff ; but at the electl.iou tlhere 0
were eight or nine candidates for G
every office.
Q. It is simply a contest for t'fe. I'
then, that creates this feeliugf l
that the only cause ?
A. I cannot saX that that is the "
Q. What is the cause tlhen a
A. Well, sir, one cause is that the
eople of that pariah have been bur
doned with a large debt, I think
*1C2,000, some where in that neigh
borhood.
Q. Hlow was that debt contracted Ia
A. That was contracted paltlhy y
Democrat and partly by Relputblicans.
Q. For what purpose was it cre
ated *
A Our coulrt house exiclnses el-er:i c
year are siabout sixteen thoumtand doll
lars, including witnesses fees and 3
juaror eertilicates; and then we have v
bad paper issued for various ernuses. V
Q. Within what time has thalt debt
been created S
A. Thirty thousand dollars of it I
was created before the war. A gen
tleman, who was very rich, loaned
the parish the money and took the
parish boods; and upon these bonds
a judgemeat was obtained.
Q. luow was thle residue coantracted f
A. The residue of the debt is held a
by D)emocrat wilhe are juligment cre
ditors and by some RIepublicans. I
Q. I asked you when and for what
purpose it wlas contracted I
A. I cannot say that; for parish
expenses, bridges and some little
rings up there.
Q. What is tihe rate of taxation ?
A. About eighlt per cent.
Q. Is that upon l itR assesieili1t of
the property at its cash valulation ?
Yes, sir, property tlere is assessed I
very fairly ; about ten dollars an a-re,
I believe for the tfinest lands and some
at five dollars.
Q. How long has it been since tax- 1
ation has amounted to that f
A. Only within the last two years,
I believe.
Q. What party has control of thei
adiinistration f th lir of te ofhe
parish'?
A. Well, sir, the Repullican.
Q. Do you think the bad state of
:;'ling has grown iprincipally out of
: tiianjil cndition of the parish,
t:' rher th:iI the opposition to the
L lu l,, zocerinment
A. I trhiak that is one of the causes;
I ;i! :Is I stated before they all wanted
tQ. ily the Chairnman.-You stated
lyour olini, ; as to the intimidationuf
ihe ct'lor,: peopie. Now suppoeo
Sthlr:, -:::s i:o c:.use of complaint grew
in; ut of tia:s one.rous taxation and
thlit wa:s n1o feling oil the part of
the i:ii: ocr:ts tl.te that the Gov
erne.r of th Sttto was a person not
Ieally nititle to the ofllce, what. in
",our judla ntl, wiuld be the feeling
twet- Ithe pa rties D1)o you think
you coe::ld thhen be a memuber of the
llit:publirail party with safety f
A. WYell, sir, 1 can only be governed
by the past in answering that ques
tion. I know, sir. that no longer
thanl a year ago, anld previous to that,
som;e gcutenlCien, who are now very
bitter Democrats, were afliliating
with lRepulbelin, anid it was so
asserted on the streets.
Q. What was the eifect of their
being Rlepublicans ?
A. Well, sir, they had not come out
and declared themselves sullicienltly to
sal .:r fromn o.stranismt. I caine out
and declared Inyself a Republician.
They attempted to,tjiu the party even
this last campaign. One did join
btt the pressuro was so great he had
to go ba:ck.
Q. What I wanted to get at is,
whether the state of criminal violence
or lawless violenco is occasioned by
a feeling occasionod by this onerous
debt, and by the feeling that the
State governmnent is not entitled to
hold and is an usurpation ; or wheth
