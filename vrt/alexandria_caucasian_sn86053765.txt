A. Country Home Happy.
■».v. Farm life is not at all labor, nor
4«» paid either. The word "borne"
.ia to be more thoagbt of than it
QjNwUl l>e;auil surely there is
in rural pursuits to
a home on the farm both in
atrucüve and attractive. The ques
tion of a profit is less to be thought
of than the desiee for a happy, pure
and comfortable living. A writer
in a recent number of the Sew
Bnglejid Farmer has sonle excellent
ideäs upon the subject of farm life,
«hieb may suggest some topics not
often thought of by tillers of the
s° n '/^ÊÊÊÊtm
'•We waHt to see farmers' homes
as comfortable, as convenient, and
- beaatiful as it is possible to
them. A painted house not
looks better than an nnpaint
èd one, but it is warmer and will
longer. Some men with ex
ideasof economy claim that
to ire-clapboard.. the
of a house when the clap
r boards are worn out than to keep
them painted. We do not care
y Whether it cheaper or not. We
are willing j to pay something for
the good looks of a well painted
dwelling house.
The grounds around tbe farmer's
home should be kept clean and the
walks dry lind in good order. Let
the gras« plats be enriched by a top
dressing *>f(>ld fire manure, that
wiltmake the grass look thrifty and
summer through.
"And, who if not farmers, should
to their homes with shrubs
rersl It need not cost
much 'money to collect enough flow
ere and flowering shrubs to set iu
all the warm nooks and corners
around our buildings.

"Encourage your children to
mçkç such collections of natural cu
riosities as your localities affords.
If near the sea, beautiful specimens
of shell-work may ornament your
rooms, and everywhere collections
of insects and butterflies maybe
made, that will add to the attrac
tions of your home and at the s£ne
time aflord subjects for study to
both children and friends. Thé
study Of the habits of insects and
arranging of collections may lead
some young person in the neighbor
hood to take up the higher art of
collecting and stuffing for preser
vation, specimens of our native
birds and animals.
"We like to see a country home
look as if it was of the country, and
not imported from or imitation of
the city ; but we would make it so
tasteful that, our city friends can
enjoy a visit with us. We need
their influence. Thep help polish
us up, so we cau feel a little more
easy when we visit them.
"One thing more must be added
to your home to make it what.a
home should be, which, although
mentioned last, is really of the first
importance. This is to provide a
suitable place for an abundance of
good books, magazine and newspa
pers, and then see that the books,
magazines and newspapers are pro
vided, and the children induced to
ascertain what is in them. It is en
tirely too late in the day to expect
an ignorant man to be a prosperous
farmer. He must study his busi
ness by méaus of books aud news
papers, as well as by experiments
in the field. He must know what
others are doing and what other
have learned iu his business. A
well selected agricultural library in
a farmers's home is a pretty sure
indicatiou that there is no mortgage
on tÉoso premises.

ak they would lose by it. These
'indeed flimsy grounds whereon
Constitutional principles, and they
entonslrau- how far we have wandered
from the old landmarks when constitu
tional questions were measured by
constitutional provisions.
Has Congress the authority to pitos
any such law T That each branch
Congress can unseat members and thus
render elections accessary in Status,
a doctrine as old as the Constitution.
Bus never, until the rébellion made
reconstruction a necessity, did any
body contend that Congress had power
to order, or to set aside, or io any way
to regulate or interfere with State elec
tion for State officers. It was a sound
doctrine that the unprecedenfed seces
sion of eight W nine States made, un
precedented measut es absolutely neces
sary to restre their old relations to the
Um ion after the war was over; and
doubtless posterity will not harshly
judge whatever was done to Becure
that end.'
But after an insurgent State was
fully reclaimed and pnt in running
order, oeither the original constitution
nor the recent amendments conferred
upon Congress auy more authority
meddle in its purely State elections
than in those of Maine or Ohio. The
oft-cited clause of the Constitution,
that " United States shall gnarantoa
every State in this Union a republican
fdrm of government,does not apply
to » ease like that « M m
ana. The form of the government
thet State is all riglit. The difficulty
arises ont of carrying an election
fraud on the spot, and the outside in
terférence of the army by order of the
President. The conspirators who per
petrated the jraud ouget to be sent
the penitentirry like ordinary ballot
box stuffers, while the high Federal
officials who snstainen them with
bayonets onght to be impeached as
warning to such ot their successors
may be tempted iu like manner to of
fend.
We can well understand the dilemma
of the Administration and the Republi
can majority iu Congress. The Presi
dent has for unworthy purposes rushed
headlnng into*this Louisiana business,
aud has thereby disgraced the Bepub
lican party and imperilled the country;
aud he ought to be compelled to get all
concerned out of thexliffiiculty. But
the passage of an act of Congress or
dering a ne v State election ià not the
way out. There has been quite
enough of this sort of interaieddliug
with State elections, nnder the shadow
of Congress, by venal scoundrels like

milk in each is held iu eouiln
eut tabes, which, like the roots of
tree, are all contracted into one
just above the teat; the milk en
tering the funnel -ab aped organ
a single cb mittel. Jost at the up
per end of the tea( the all of this
channel are contracted, and the
contraction is surrouuded by
band of muscular fibers. The will
of the cow can operate on this
band, contracting or expadding
at pleasure, making it operate like
a valve. At the junction of each
smaller tube with a large one,
a similar contraction and band,
also under the control of the will.
Ordinarily these bands are con
tracted (as in the neck of the blad
der), so that the milk has to crowd
its way through them to get from
the smaller into the larger tubes.
This is an admirable arrange
ment for sustaining the weight
the milk equally in all parts of the
udder, and preventing, it from
pressing heavily npon the teats.
When the udder is full, if the
milk is drawn out of the teats,
lieving the pressure in them, it
quires a vigorous effort of the will
of the cow to prevent the pressure
crowding the a*ilk

of the muscular bands necessary
prevent entirely the milk from flow

milker first takes hold of the teats
a-nd begins to milk, the excitrment
causes the cow to con tract the bands
so firmly as to hold back the milk
perfectly for a time. But presently
this vigorous contraction will begin
to slacken, and the milk will begin
to pour through, and if all is quiet,
she will relax the bands fully,
wheh tue milk all settles down up
on the teats, and is quickly drawn,
it can be all milked out to the very
last drop.
But this perfect relaxation will
only last/or a short time. If the
milk is not soon extracted) she will
begin to tighten up the muscular
bands again, and the last part
