FORGOTTEN SONG.
By Ethel Clifford.
How shall we meet that have been
parted long?
I have forgot the burden of the song
We sang together very long ago.
How shall we meet that used to be
so dear?
I have forgot the page that was so
clear
In the lost book whose name we
did not know.
Have you forgotten, too? You tell
me, no,
But can you sing the song of long
ago,
Take up the measures and com
plete the stave?
How strange it were if all the years
that seem
To stand between us proved an emp
ty dream,
And I could give you now what
then I gave!
Alas! The rose, half - gathered,
droops and dies,
And tears that fall not still may
blind the eyes;
The song unfinished halts until the
end.
How shall we meet that parted long
ago?
I have forgot the song we used to
know,
And broken music none may ever
mend.
—New York American.
McLendon s suspension.
If the voters of Georgia, instead
of the legislature, could have passed
on the matter of S. G. McLendon’s
suspension as chairman of the Rail
road Commission, we do not believe
that Hoke Smith’s action ever would
have been sustained.
Chief among the reasons the ex
governor gave for the suspension of
the chairman was that he had broken
his pledge to the people. Investiga
tion discloses that Hoke Smith is the
one who broke his promise to the
people. The Macon platform called
for “immediate” action in the port
rate matter. The governor and the
commission were instructed to take
“immediate” action. But what did
Governor Smith do? Instead of act
ing “immediately” he waited until
his term had nearly expired to take
any action in the matter, and then
not until he had been tormented into
it by Clark Howell in the Constitu
tion. And when he did finally call
on the commission to act in the mat
ter, what did he ask of them? He
asked for special rates from the
ports to Atlanta, exclusive of all oth
er inland points, which, as you see,
would give Atlanta a special priv
ilege which the other towns in the
State would not have enjoyed, and
genuine Democracy is eternally op
posed to special privileges. When
McLendon voted down this proposi
tion to give Atlanta this special priv
ilege, he did the people of the bal
ance of the State a valuable service,
and they will not be slow to show
their appreciation if given an oppor
tunity.
In the first place, the suspension
was not sustained on any of the
charges of Governor Smith, but upon
the bond deal, which was not men
tioned in the governor’s charges.
It has been proved that in the bond

transaction McLendon violated no
law.
He may have made a mistake, but
that is not sufficient reason for the
legislature to take the action they
did in the matter. Their disposition
of the question was altogether arbi
trary, without any law whatever to
sustain them, and in voting as they
did they have established a most dan
gerous precedent.
The McLendon investigation ele
vated the suspended chairman in our
estimation, and if he wants an office
in the gift of the people of Georgia
nothing that has yet been brought
out against him will restrain us from
giving him our hearty support.—

HOW THE NAVY WORKS.
The battleship Alabama was com
missioned eight years ago—three
years after the Spanish-American
war—at a cost of $2,650,000 for con
struction alone. Already she has be
come practically obsolete and has
been ordered to the navy in
Brooklyn to be rebuilt, at a cost of
$1,000,000 or more. The ship must
have new engines, new boilers and
new guns, and the armor must be
strengthened. Ten years hence, the
vessel will probably be sent to the
scrap heap. That is the way modern
navy enlargement goes.— Marietta
(Ga.) Journal.
Gov. Hoke Smith’s opinion
about who should be appointed rail
road commissioner to succeed Mr.
McLendon, will probably have no
bearing with Gov. Brown in naming
a successor. It is now Governor
Brown, and not Governor Smith. —
Wrightsville (Ga.) Chronicle.
“Little Joe” got the boot; Tom
' v atson got the boot; then the boot
was given to Guyt. In between times,
however, the people gave Hoke the
boot. This would seem to have
evened things up a bit, at any rate. —

GREAT MIDDLE WEST.
Senator Davis, of Arkansas, in a
speech denouncing the tariff bill
poked some of the members some
hard jolts in the ribs about their
only ambition being to swell their
colossal fortunes by taking from the
poor man his last vestige of hope and
from their helpless families their
only means of sustenance. Among
other things he said: “They are
turning their faces in hopefulness
and glad acclaim to the great Middle
West, where a small cloud has arisen,
which is gathering in strength and
JEFFERSONIAN CLUB No. 1, Thomson, Georgia
An enthusiastic meeting was held at the Court House, Thomson,
Ga., on Saturday, September, 4th, to organize Jeffersonian Club No. 1.
Colonel John A. Wilkerson was elected President, and S. G. Hawes
Secretary. Members were detailed to begin an active campaign
throughout McDuffie County.
Jeffersonian Clubs are now being organized at many points in
Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas.
We shall know next week which state will have the honor of or

kings and the belief that one crowd
was created to be ridden, booted and
spurred by their masters, and that
when they call for bread they should
be given a stone, and when their
children cry for fish they should be
given a serpent.” The hope of the
country is in the fearless, indepen

be he insurgent, Democrat, Prohibi

coming to a point where they must
be “shown”.—Mitchell Gazette.
We have been shown and the peo

backyard of Little Rhody.—Sioux

BELONGS TO NO PARTY.
The fact is that predatory wealth
knows no party. The great mass of
the people of all parties believe in,
and want, a square deal. But they
are partyolaters. They permit them
selves to be hoodwinked, quadrenni
ally, by the r esentatives of the
system. Fo' corrupt politician
you put • ager on, there is
standing for him, and profit-
ing by’ some big business
man. N?al corruption and spe-
cial <>.6Le are twin evils. The

m along unless he has back of
r wealth, than a train
V ? ove without propelling power.
Th Senators or other Congressmen
who are defying platforms or other
expressions of the will of the people
lose little sleep over the protests of
the people for they are sure of the
friendship of those who “work” the
people.—Pennsboro (W. Va.) News.
THE WHEREFORE OF THESE
TEARS!
Concluding a big type editorial on
the appointment of Mr. Joseph F.
Gray, of Savannah, as Railroad Com
missioner, the Atlanta Journal ex
claims in its wrath:
“In bold and defiant terms the
present administration has made its
choice.
“Thus taunted in the midst of op
pression, the people of Georgia will
know how to act.”
O, mommer!
O, mammy, look at Sam!
Send for the suck-bottle!
But what is all this noise about?
For the first time in the history
of the Railroad Commission the sec
ond city in the State, Savannah, gets
a member of the Railroad Commis
sion. The second time in its history
South Georgia gets a Commissioner.
The other one was McLendon and
they fired him, and more than half
of the representatives of South Geor
gia, under some strange hypnotic in
fluence, danced around the funeral
pile.
Atlanta has two Commissioners out
of five. She tried hard to get Brown
to give her this one, but Brown gave
the job to a South Georgian.
Hence these tears!
It is the grief of the daughters of
the horsecloth. They cry “give,
give!” Solomon said there are three
things that are never satisfied, “yea
four things say not, ‘it is enough!’ ”
but Solomon never knew Atlanta.
The Journal’s kick—the ostensible
kick—is on Gray, because it says, he
is opposed to “port rates”; and the
Journal is going to have those spe
cial privilege rates for certain At
lanta jobbers as sure as Billy B. Dam
jawed his mother-in-law.
So far as Gray’s port rate record
is known, he presented to the Com
mission some resolutions from the
Savannah Chamber of Commerce pro
testing against the granting to Beck
& Gregg, of Atlanta, special rates on
“special iron,” which, if granted,
would have given them a great ad
vantage over all the other dealers in
hardware in Georgia.
Savannah as a business community
resisted the Beck & Gregg conten
tion; and she acted through her
Chamber of Commerce, and her
Chamber of Commerce sent its reso
lutions by the hand of its secretary,
and this secretary was Joseph F.
Gray.
Four previous Railroad Commis
sions refused Atlanta these special
rates; and for that offense against
Atlanta jobbers Hoke Smith fired
first Joe Brown, now Governor, and
then Guyt McLendon. If Joe Brown
thought when he was a Commission
er that special privileges were un-
Democratic and wrong, he doubtless
thinks so now. If any issue is made
in this case the people of Georgia
made it when they elected Brown
Governor.
The Journal cannot weave another
web over the eyes of the people on
this question. The people were
fooled once, but they cannot be fooled
the second time by the same trick
operated by the same tricksters. The
people are not fools. The cry of
wolf got them once. It failed the
second time. It will fail again the
third time. —Macon (Ga.) Telegraph.
