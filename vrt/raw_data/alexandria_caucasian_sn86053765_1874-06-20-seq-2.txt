THE WHITE MAN'S PAR 1
We publish tuis morning oilito
rial articles from the New Orleans
Picayune and tlie Morning Star and
Catholic Messenger , endorsing the
movement to organize a White
Man's party. With the Shreveport
Times, New Orleans Bee and
Opelousas Courier , already °ad
vocating tlie movement, wé have
now no doubt but that the
campaign this Fall, will be fought
upon that issue. We have to rë.
gret, and we sincerely regret that
the Bulletin has deserted us, and
gone over te the Democracy. It
aud many others of our exchauges
are, however, but feeliyg their way,
and when the people have spoken,
as we are satisfied they will speak
ere long, we will again count the
Bulletin among the strongest of our
allies,
We desire not to be misunder
stood in the matter of our opposi
tion to the Democracy, or rather of
our opposition to making the cam
paign under the name of the Demo
cratic party. We.have all been
Democrats from our. youth up, have
the most sincere veneration for the
name, the utmost pride in.the re
collection of its many victories and
its glorious struggles, and an hon
est reverence for its .past history.
Wo are opposed to it now, gnly- be
cause 0 we are certain that a Demo
cra f[ c campaign will fail to unite

the white people, aud we ate as
firmly convinced as we ever were iu
our lives, that alone in the entire
unanimity of the white people cau
we hope to win. We are not alone
in the opinion that it is utterly ûse ;
less to attempt to get the votes of
thc°negroes. Never baye they been
so united as at present, becaifse
they think that they ate sustained
by the U. S. Government, and they
wegavd their complete elevat ion to
social equality with, and political
supremacy over the white race, as
almost accomplished; as indeed,- is
the fact, unless -we oppose to his
rapid encroachments a solid, unitçd
front this Fall..
If Democracy will uni te the white
people, then we are in favor of De
mocracy. If it can even ^how us
how it can entertain a reasonable
.
hope of doing so. upon au y of the
old party issues, we-will surfender,
at discretion. Until it can do so,, we
will continue to hold out to the pov
erty-stricken, tax-v;<lden and negro
bimleued people of Louisiana, a
(?) (Ë) ' ©

brb'ad enough to hold Whips, Know

ocrats -and even Republicans, if
there are any honest ones 'among
the tfbite aMies ot the neqroes : in
plicity commends itself to the intel
ligence of the most ignorant, and
upon which there can be no divis

YYe have tried Democracy and
failed, we have tried à Reform Par
ty and failed, we have tried a Libe
ral Party and failed; by tlie- union
or fusion ot all these parties we won
in 1872, and by the union of all of
them, we will win in 1874. We
pr esent to then?all a name, an issue
and a platform, upon which fiiey
can unite without the necessity ot
half a dozen conventions, or t ! ie in
tervention of a% y central commit
tees. ©Any. other plan will result
in the divisions that it was necessa
ry to unite iu 1S72, and we may not
rccoucile them as we did then?

The simple question is whether
the white man „or tile negro shall
rule Louisiana, aijd we are in favor
of making the fair, square fight *, of
making the negro swallow the pill
without miy sugar ©?oating to dis
guise its taste. Let ua make this
fight and if we fail, we will do no
more than all other parties have
doue, and we have the right to
make one failure upon this issue
any way. # »

The Grant Parish Prisoners.
We have published elsewhere the
verdict of the Jury iu this case, show
ing the conviction of Cruikshànk,
Hadnot and Irwin of conspiracy
and the acquittal of the other pris
oners. Those who were acquitted
passed up on the Bart .Able, on
Monday. The conviction of those
three gentlemen for "conspiracy" is
a judicial outrage that will stamp
with imperishable infamy the names
of the Judge, Jury and District At
torney &rhft have made it a crime to
defend the virtue of our wives,
daughters and mothers; an ofieuse
to .protect our homes and an out
rage to suppress by the only means
in our power, an insolent mob of in
luriated brutes and barbarians, who
menaced and threatened alike the
persons of our women, the lives of
our cbildrcp and the security of our
property
With a prosecuting Attorney,
embittered by bate, revelling in his
apostacy to his race; with a Judge
upon the bench, with no scruples:
for the sanctity of his oath, no re
gard for the foiled ermine lie wore;
and with a jury selected from the
scum of the Custom-house, chosen
for the dirty work, it i3 only sur
prising to us that all of the priso
ners were not convicted of murder
and htyig befor© the ink of the ver
dict was dry. We.propose to em
balm th% names and memory of
Woods, the Judge, and Beckwith,
the Persecutor, that they may be
held up to the execration of gener
ations to come; the first as a fit
companiou for Jeffries, as a parti
san Judge, and the latter as a suit
able historical, associate for Judas
Iscariot. ^ 0
A crime, forsooth, to suppress a
moo of negroes, armed, oflicered
and drilled, in open deiiauce of law,
whose daily boast^and song was
"that they were going to°murderall
the white- men and take all the
white women for their wives;" and
this too after reputed ineffectual
appeals had been made to the offi
rs of the law to protect the coun
try from "the necessity of protecting
itself; ©öfter every peaceable oVer
ture had been rejected with inso
Ience; and even after twqof our side
had been shot down under the flag
of truce raised by themselves! O

To what a pftss have wo come! Is
there wanting any other, any iur
tlier inducements for.the white peo
pleto organi se and to resolv<i that
such things .shall not be? 'friis is
but another step toward the eleva
tion©of the negro and the grind
ing of the whites by the fron heel
of power: and. the fact t'.^t all the
negro witnesses, whose unblushing
pei juiy is their commendartiou to
Woods and Beckwith, came home
eacb-apined with an army rifle aud
amuH^iitiou, is but the result of just
s#ch teachings as this, itiuf just such
teachings brought ou the Colfax
fight and will bring on others iu
which the negro will be the vi ci im
again, as her was there, ot tlie mill
ish „designs ot such masters as

T iie@ O roi»s .—Iu an extended
journey over the greater portion of
our parish, last week, we had an op
portunity to judge tor ourselves of
the prospects Of the coming crop.—
Our observation extended over bay
ous Roheit, B^euf and Rapides aud
the hill crops on o tbis side of lied
River. It gratifies us to be able to
report that the prospects of a good
crop are promising aud encour
aging.
The cane crop is really fiuc—this
is particularly, true of the stubble
cane. The caue'fields are covered
with good stands of both stubble
and plant, looks well, is clean and
growing finely. 0
The late corn seems to be doing
better than the old, but both give
promise of a good corn crop, The
cotton is generally backward and
S |pall, but the stand is excellent—
the color good and the cotton grow
ing fast. We think that we can
safely promise a good crop for this
yeaiigh
The Ci
toil ing C ampaign.
" The political fight this Fall is for
the redemption of our State, un
mixed. with a national campaign
and presenting no national issnes.
It is fortunate for us that it is so.
It matters to us but little who is
President or who goes to Cougress,
but we are directly interested in the
questions as to who is Govemorwhat
sort of a Legislature we have and
who fills the Parish offices I "®It is
true, that it is more than probable
that we will have Kellogg, the Usur
per, iajBtened upon us for two years
more, but if we. can get control of the
House of Representatives, ho will
find himself, as will his negro
Senate, shorn of the power to op
press us, aud utterly at our mercy.
A proper organization of the white
people of the different parishes will
secure the election of a majority of
the lower house of the Legislature.
The electjou by the white people
of the State Treasurer, will prove to
the North and particularly to Con
gress, the truth-of our assertion that
we carried the State in 1872, and
will doubtless force that- body to
give us relief by a néw election for
all the State offices, or at least by a
reoogniti(Bi of our right to those
officers by admitting oue Senator
and Representatives into Congress.
On the other hand, if the negroes
elect the Treasurer our hopes in
that quarter will be efiectually
crushed, and bur protestations be
belled. .
The election of the different Par
ish officers Will result iu the mate
rial improvement of our condition
at home and will secure a fair and
honest administration of the jury
laws, and the election law iu 1S7G.
©
All or any of these results will en
courage our own | copie and propor
tionately discourage the negroes -
and make success in the future a
certaiuty. It is for the people to
determine whether all these com
bined," make a stake worth their
united and vigorous efforts, or
whether they will fold their hands
and hand the parishes and the State
over to tlie negroes. The question
is already answered, we heard the
voice of a large portiou of the peo
ple of our parish last week, and the
stentorian tones iu which they de
clared that they would never give
up the fight, will find suclfan echo
ing response amoug all tlie wliite
people Of Rapides, as will put out
gloriops old parish' into the hands
of her rightful Rulers—the honest
and, intelligent white people. So
mote it be ! °
The Will of the People. °
Government derives its only force
from tlie will and cousent of the
goverued. Atr©othcr gover riment is
a Usurpation, whether republican
or monarchical iu its form, and his
tory is full of instances where the
people have risen in their might
a\id overturned both the govern
ment and the Usurper.
o Amoug the ways of cheating the
people of Louisiana out of their
choice of rulfcrs, the radicals and
uegrôes devised the cunning scheid
of constituting a Returning Board
with po wer to count the °votes, or
yi other words, to always count the
radicals and negroes in. JQ and the
white people out.
W r ehave heard objections to ma
king any fight-this Fall, aud from
sources where we least expected it,
because, it is urged, if we win, Kel
logg's Returuing Board will count
us out any way. To all such croak
ers we will say that the day is past
when the people ot Louisiana mean
to submit again to such frauds
upon their rights. If we win we
will have the election or wo will
have anarchy. Te^xas aud Arkan
sas has taught us a lesson^ have
pointed out the way, and we Vill
not be slow t^ follow it. Under
the present electioh law the votes
are to be counted at the parish
seats, and it will be easy .to know
' ° 0
whether or not we have won, and
if we win, as we will, if the white
people unite, we wi^l have what we
have won, if we have to go further
than the people g^ent in Arkansas.
We don't intend to be cheated again
and a united people driven to des
peration are by uo means to be tri
fled with. °
State Convention at Alexandria.
Last week, we copied an article
from the Shreveport Times, suggest
ing that th* State Convention be
held at Alexandria in August. The
Louisiana Democrat has taken up
the question and like us, is warmly
in favor of it and joins us in extend
ing a cordial iuvitatiou to the dele
gates from the other parishes, and
iii the assurance that we will make
them comfortable while here. "We
have the largest hotel in the State
outside o£ New Orleans; our new
Court House is the finest in the
State, not excepting any in New!
Orleans; besides which we have two
other "large halls, either of which
will amply accommodate the con
ventiou; and our fine side wheel
packet, the Bart Able, will afford a
pleasant trip up on Monday artd
back again on Wednesday. We
adopt the suggestion ûî the Demo
erat, that .the Convention be held
here on
Monday the 3, day August,
next. If there is no other call, let
the different parishes send delegates
here then and we will have a con
vention oi the people, regardless of
parties. Some such step is imper
atively necessary, at an early day.
"The White League."
From the New Orleans Picaynne.
The course of the carpet-bag dem
agogues iu this State, in driv'ig or
cajoling the negroes into distinct or
ganizations, aud a concentrated
mass of voters, operating on a race
and color basis, has produced its
natural and apprehended results.
The responsibiliiy lor this opeu and
declared purpose of the colored peo
pie to stand aloof from all political
association aud co-operation with
the great majority of. the whites—
including the whole of the more in
telligent aud virtuous of them; to
maintain a segregated negro party;
to draw a broad liue of separation
and hostile antagonism between the
two races, very certainly attaches
to the African race. They have
scorned all efforts and approches to
Q
induce them to divide as the white
people do everywhere else on polit
ical questions, piinciples and ideas.
Even when they are drawn towards
the white conservative people by
many Strong interests and ties they
are repelled by the menaces of their
brethren and the prejudices of their
race. These prejudices and pas
sious have been - kept alive© by
the cunning devices aud appeals of
the white robbers and adventurers
who are the prime authors of the
political troubles aud discords of
our people,
Thus we arc threatened with a
race èonûict iu this State. It does
not comport with the self-respect
and pr ide of the white race to make
any further appeals to this mis.
guided people. They aie crazed
with the pride and ambition to lord
it over their, superiors in- civiliza
tion, in virtue, and iutelligence
This cannot be any longer. Hence
the organization of the White
League iu the rççiuntry parishes,
It lias beeu^forced upon the people
by the misery .and impoverishment
brought upon îtîe State by govern
ments which owe their existence
and their power to plunder and op
press, to the concentrated negro
vote. We tjilist that the deplorable
consequences which mus: result to
the Statfylroin a conflict, thus pro
voked, will be avoided by the aban
donment 011 the part of the colored
v^pters^of the position of irreconcila
ble hostility toward the respecta
ble,/wbifce people, and their aliena
tion from the low class of white
demagogues and rogues Who have
hitherto managed them for fheir
own base uses. We see no other
course that cau save this State from
the horrors of a con flic! of races of
a most serious character. There
are too many white people with too
large interests in Louisiana to ren-©
der its Africanization practicable—
at. leafct permanently practicable.
We have already been earned too
far in that direction. Our white
brethren at the North reprove our
tameness and submission in the past
They expect and demand a firmer
course in the future in vindication
-of our race, our rights as freemen
and citizens of a great republic

THE BARBECUE!
A Grand Success!
The People of the Pine Woods United !
RESOLUTIONS PASSED CALLING A
MASS COVENTION AT ALEXAN
DRIA, ETC., ETC.
The Barbecue and political meet
ing held near Paul's Store was a
success beyond our expectations.
The place selected for the'public
meeting was a romantic spot,, wliere
majestic oak trees stretched their
strong arms, with full grown foliage,
to shade the ground, and protect it
from the sultry rays of a vertical
sun. Seats, had been prepared for
the accommoda&Sî ûjfc^lie people—
and a stand for the speakers. Thé
meeting was largely attended, al
though many more would have
been- present but for the rain the
day before.
Robt. P. Hunter and W. F.
Blackman, were called upon and
addressed the meeting, .represent
ing the necessity of organization
and united'action of the white peo
ple, to redeem Louisiana from the
oppressive rule of ignorance and
corruption. Their political views
have been so often presented in the
Caucasian , that it is deemed unne
cessary to give even a synopsis of
their speeches. After the speak
ing was over, the following resolu
tions were adopted: .
Itesolred, That wo the people of Spring
Creek, and adjoining wards, believe it to
be our solemn duty to oar conntr.v, to onr
selves and to posterity, never to ceaso
straggling for an honest and constitution
al government iu'LouiAiana.
Itesotved, That an organization of tlio
white people, tnx-paycrs nnd all opposed
to the corrupt rule ot Radicalism in Lou
isiana, is essentially necessary, and in or
der to effect this organization and tu unite
all the conservative voters, in this parish
into oue poltical party, that will elect hon
est and couipeteiù men for office wo
earnestly request our fellow citizens of the
Parish of Rapides, to meet in mass con
vention at Alexandria, at some future day.
Notice of the time of said nieetiug. we re
quest be given iu the parish papers.
JOHN J. 8 WANN,
President.
The large crowd immediatly af
terwards were invited to the tables
on which was an abundance of bar
becued meats aud bread of all kind,
which was a sight to gladden the
eyes iu these hard times. There
was an ample supply for every man,
woman-and chjld, and every one
seemed to eujoy the. generous hos
pitality of the citizens of Spring
Creek ward.
Captain Dave Paul, that chival
rous and liberal citizen, who is held
in the highest esteem and respect
by every white man in Rapidesand
adjoining parishes, whose name is
a familiar word in every family cir
cle, was tlie general superintendent,
and under his management arid
with his courteous demeanor, every
thing passed off pleasantly and
without the slightest disturbance.
About 3 P. M., the large crowd be
gan to disperse, the old people re
turning to their homes, while tlio
young ladies and gentlemen ad
journed to the house of Dr. Hobby,
and engaged iu a merry dance, un.
til the hour of twilight dim, when
the souud of music aud revelry
ceased.
The people evidently were a unit
on the question of a White Man's
organization, and are desirous to
have the whole people of Rapides
meet in mass convention, Organise
and prepare for the campaign.
We feel well assured that their
call will be responded to, and at the
appointed time which will soon be
designated, wc expect to see a
larger mass meeting than was ever
known in I^rpides. The resolu
tions above a?e eminirtently conser
vative, not iu the bigoted spirit of
party, but exhibit a patriot
ic desire to unite all opposed to
Radicalism, into one organization.
Thus, we think that the resolutions
commend themselves to every white
man, who feels the slightest inter
est in the / redemption of his ruined
The Barbecue in all was a com
plete success, and it is hoped that
other sections of the Parish will
hold Mass Meetings where the pol
itical issues can be discussed.
CF Wo take great pleasure in
calling attention to the law card of
Edwin G. Hnnter, who has just ob
tained his license from the Snprcmc
Court at Opelousas.
