LAW AND ORDER LEAGUE.
As a result of the two meetings of
citizens held Saturday noon at the
Board ci trade and Saturday night at
the opera house, a "Law and Order
League" has been organized, the pur
pose of which is to assist the lawful au
thorities in the maintenance of law and
order.
The Law and Order League sprang
into existence to meet an emergency. It
was ereated in response to a general
feeling of apprehension and fear arising
from the lawless acts of some men with
a grievance for which the people art not
responsible. It is as well be cl ii i and
say that grievance is no concern of the
people. It is a fact, however, that one
man, J. Huckles, was caught red hand
ed in the act of cutting the guy w:- ± of
a telephone pole which, had it fallen.
would have led no doubt to direful re
suits. It is also a fact that other " es
were cut with diabolical Eesign an. it s
also a fact that the peace and order of
this community was threatened, men
aced to an extent which lei Mayor
Querbes to prompt action and to his ac
tive support by law-abiding citizens.
The spirit and purposes of this Law and
Order League is directed at no class of
people nor at organized or individual
labor, but to the maintenance of law
against every attempt at lawlessness. It
will be conceded that in the moment of
excitement there was comiimitted errors
of judgment, but these were prompted
by the fear and the apprehension which
suggested, devised and established the
Law and Order League. This error was
dropped when it became manifest and it
is senseless to agitate it or to become The
champion of any man. There is law suf
ficient to reach every m; n regardless of
his station or positic'i in life, and by
that law which must safeguard life and
property we will stand and support un
qualifiedly and irrevocably. regardles of
all interests.
No good eitiseno f thoughtful, wilt
snler at or deride the eforts of the
14w and Order League; nor sloull any

A LITTLE SHORT.
For reasons which would not alter the
case to explain, we are a little short on
locals, but it could not be helped.
THE CRAWFORD CASE
On Sunday morning with the consent
and approval of the court and the attor
neys connected with the case the jury's
verdict was received, and to the sur
prise of the defendant and his friends
the verdict was Suilty, of manslaughter,
with an earnest recommendation for
mercy. The wife and the daughters of
the prisoner - were overwhelmed and
gave vent to their feelings in tears and
lamentations. It was a pitiful, a sor
rowful sight.
On Tuesday afternoon a motion for a
new trial was submitted, the pleas be
ing that the verdict was epntrary- to the
law and the evidence; that in the room
occupied by the jury there were law
books from which some of the jurof's
read; there wAs a newspaper from
which the jurors read and that the jury
had been taken to Frank's Restaurant
for their meals, Ind while there had
been served their meals by employes of
the restaurant, etc., etc. With these ex
ceptions the defendant's attorneys ex
pect a new trial, and if denied ,will ap
peal to the -Supreme Court; Each reader
may draw his own conclusion as to
these technicalities, but the Caucasian
without hesitation must commend the
action of the jury. The verdict was re
sponsive to the evidence and the law.
It is a fair and correct -verdict which
will receive the hearty endorsement of
all classes of the people not interested
in the case or related to the accused.

the cutting of the 4elephone wires was

Shaky Rope Bridges.
@i the wilds of 'outh America many
rope bridges exist, and in writing of
them a traveler, who published through
Messrs. Longmans "The Great Moun
tains and Forests of South America,"
says: "There being no trees here, such
bridges as were necessary were usual
ly constructed of a couple of ropes
stretched across a chasm, upon which
was spread a rough kind of matting
made of pliant brushwood or a sort of
rush. Such bridges swung about fear
fully and cracked under the foot as if
about to give way. Often I held my
breath while passing such a bridge,
momentarily expecting the rotten con
trivance to part in the middle. There
was plenty of evidence in the skeletons
of horses and mules on the rocks be
low that accidents not infrequently oc
curred, but I was assured that not
many men were lost, which, of course,
was an exceedingly comforting assur
ance, especially as I noticed that the
guides were careful to see that either
I or George was the first to cross
these confounded structures. At one of
these places we saw on the rocks 300
feet below the skull and bones of two
men who had been lost about eight
years before."
Snakes Waste Little Time Eating.
A serpent will go for weeks, some
times even for months, without feed
ing. Then It may take three rabbits or
ducks, one after the other, at a single
meal and afterward become torpid
while digestion proceeds. When, after
a suiflelent period of fasting, It gets
disposed to eat and a rabbit happens to
be Introduced Into its cage,. - it may
plainly be seen that the rabbits pres
ence is quickly noticed by it. The
snake will begin to move slowly about
till it hMa brought its snout opposite the
rabbit's mazzle. Then, in an Instant, it
*Wl., seize the rsbbi's head in itd
uosth, siniitineously goiliag its pow
fl body around it and cruslring it
to death at once.
The action Is so instantaneous that it
is Imposesible for the rabbit to suffer.
Otittniy it can suffer no more than
when killed by a poulterer. The snake
does not immediately uuncoil its folds,
but continues for a time to hold its vic
tim tightly embraced, sometimes rock-.
lag itself gently to and fro. Then it
slowly unwinds its huge body and once
more takes the ralbit's head in its
£nouth and swallows it.
Superstitions About Bread.
In Brittany when a housewife begins
to knead dough she makes a cross with
her right band, the left being placed in
the trough. If a cat enters the room, it
is believed the bread will not rise.
It is supposed that certain women can
cause the dough to multiply itself. On
the coast of the ehannel the dough i.
adjured to imitate the leaven, the mil
ler and the baker and to rise.
The oven is a sacred object and con
nected with crowds of superstitions
The oven is dedicated, with ceremno
nies. In certain places in Brittany the
wood Is watered with blessed water.
Bread must not be cooked on certain
days, as on Holy Friday or during the
night of All Saints, when the ghosts
would eat it.
The Introduction of Forks.
Forks are' articles of such common
household necessity to us that we hard
ly realize that there was a time, and
not so long ago either, when forks were
entirely unknown. A knife was used
at the table to cut up food, but the
food so cut was afterward conveyed by
the fingers to the mouth. Rich and poor
alike were accustomed to this method
and so thought it perfectly correct.
It was about the year 1600 and in the
reign of James I. when forks were first
introduced into England. This "piece
of refinement," we are told, was de
-rived from the Italians.
Serpent Worship In India.
Serpent worship, once very widely
diffused, survikes in India. Sometimes
when Hindoos find a cobra in sone
crevice in the wall of their house it
will often be reverenced, fed and pro
pitiated, and if fear or the death, of
some one bitten by It induces them to
remove it they will handle it tenderly
and let It loose in some field. When
Hindoos are bitten, they have far more
confidence in their magic spell or
"muntra" than in any medicine, even if
I they do not scruple to make use of
medical aid.
