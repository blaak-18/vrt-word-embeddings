PUBLIC SCHOOL 11O USES
AND GROUNDS.
The people of the various wards
in this parish should form local as
sociations for the purpose of im
proving and beautifying the public
school houses and grounds. The
present unsightly buildings which
are used as school-houses should be
replaced by new and more commo
dious structures. Where it is im
possible to raise enough money to
build anew improvements can be
made that will add greatly to the
appearance of the surroundings and
to the comfort of teacher and pu
pils. This is one thing which has
been woefully neglected in this sec
tion. There is absolutely no ex
cuse for it. With a reasonable
effort and the expenditure of a
small sum, which the patrons of the
school ought to cheerfully sub
scribe, enough could be done to
make a good beginning.
The impressions of the school
room are indelibly written on the
mind of the youth, and it is the
duty of the parent to make those
early impressions of a cheerful and
pleasant nature. And the teacher
is also entitled to some considera
tion at the hands of the people. He
can not be expected to do good
work when the school-room is a
narrow and poorly-ventilated apart
ment, and the house unpainted, the
benches uncomfortable, the grounds
dull and shadeless and the children
untidy.
The people of Lafayette do not
display the interest that they
should in the cause of public edu
cation. Undoubtedly there has
been an improvement in recent
years, but much remains to be
done, and there is no better way to
begin than by ameliorating the con
dition of the school houses and
grounds.
In this work the teacher should
be the head and front. He is
in a position to do a great
deal if he is encouraged and backed
by the people, and it is for him to
find if the people are with him and
willing to help.
It is a common thing to see a
shabby, rickety school-house stand
ing in close proximity to a large,
well-built barn. It is surely not
that we care more for the health
and comfort of our horses than
we do for the health and comfort of
our children, but the odious con
trast which suggests itself to the
mind of the wayfarer is a sad com
mentary on our taste and judgment.
WVhenever you hear a man sneer
ing at the local paper, you may
take it for granted that man is a
very narrow-minded sort of a fellow
who is too stingy to subscribe for a
paper and too lazy to read it.
The Iowa legislature has re'used
to legalize bar bills. The gentle
man who makes up his mind not to
pay the saloon-keeper for drinks
bought on credit can not be make
to do so. It seems to us that so
long as the State will license the
liquor traffic it aught to be willing
to protect those engaged in it. To
sell a man a license to deal in li
cluor and then to deny him legal
recourse is the kind of justice
which is shockingly one-sided to
say the least of it.
Free Pills.
Senti your address to H. E.
Biucklen & Co., Chicago, and get
a free sample box of Dr. King's
New Life Pills. A trial will con
vince you of their merits. These
pills are easy in action and are par
ticularly effective in the cure of con
stipation and sick headache. For
malaria and and liver troubles they
have been proved invaluable. They
are guaranteed to be perfectly free
from every deleterious substance
and to be purely vegetable. They
do not weaken by their action, but
by giving tone to stomach and
bowels greatly invigorate the sys
tem. Regular size 25c. per box.

Hon. H. P. Wells, of Richiand,
in a letter to the Beacon-News, de
clares that the act of the legislature
which makes provisions for the
holding of constitutional conven
tion is "'palpably unconstitutional.',
Mr. Wells takes the peculiar posi
tion that in view of the limitations
placed upon that convention, the
result of its work will simply be an
amended constitution, and that
amendments added to the constitu
tion in such a manner are uncon
stitutional. It is difficult to dis
cover where Mr. Wells finds author
ity to support his theory of an
amended constitution. Such con
ventions as the one proposed in
Louisiana have been held in more
than a score of "States within the
past forty years and in instance
have the courts held to Mr. Wells'
theory. On the contrary, it is a
fundamental principle of law that
the people have a right to instruct
their delegates as to the character
of the constitution they desire, and
this they will proceed to do at the
polls, for which provision has been
made in the act authorizing the
convention. In this connection' it
might also be well to correct the
wide-spread fallacy to the effect
that the convention will be limited
by act of the legislatvre. The leg
islature possesses no power to limit
a convention of the people, and
any attempt to do so would be
arbitrary and unconstitutional; but
the people, who are the source of
all authority, undoubtedly have
that right, and if the proposed con
vention is limited it will be because
the people by direct vote at the
polls limit it, and not because of
the edict of any legislative act.
The most the legislature can legally
do in this direction is to make pro
vision for ascertaining the sense of
the people on the proposition for a
limited convention, and in doing
this they have reached the limit of
their authority. This is all the late
legislature attempted to do, and to
the people, who are the paramount
authority, it very properly left the
decision as to whether cr not they
want a limited convention. The
act providing for a convention was
by no means an experiment, nor
was it the work of one man; it was
the result of careful deliberation on
the part of many of the brighest
and ablest legal minds in this State
and its constitutionality will not be
likely to be seriously attacked in
the courts.-Bato'r Rouge Advo

The fate of the negro ravisher is
the same in Ohio as it is in Louis
iana. Click Michell, the black
brute who assaulted Mrs. Gaumer
at Urbana, Ohio, richly deserved
death and to send him to the pen
itentiary would have been an out
rage on society. The white people
of the South never cared what pub
lic opinion was at the North, but
every time a negro was guilty of
assaulting a white woman, the beast
was delt with in the most approved
style. Of course a little kicking
was always indulged in by Republi
canl demagogues and the Southern
men were held up as bandits and
outlaws for daring to protect their
homes against the attacks of lustful
monsters.
The Urbana lynching proves that
the men of Ohio can be depended
upon to do the right and proper
thing every time the occasion will
present itself and that no amount
of hypocritical prating by infamous
negrophieists will render the Cau
casian so void of honor that he will
stand idly by and allow to go un
punished black fiends of the Click
Mitchell stripe.
Thomas Jefferson.
According to the admitted standards of
greatness, Jefferson was a great man. Af
ter all deductions on which his enemies
might choose to insist, his character could
not be denied elevation, versatility, breadth,
insight, and delicacy; but neither' as a poli
tician nor as a political philosopher did he
seem at ease in the atmosphere which sur
rounded him. As a leader of democracy he
appeared singularly out of place. As
reserved as PI'resident WVashington in the
face of popular familiarities, he never
showed himself in crowds. D)uring the last
thirty years of his life, he was not seen in a
SNorthern city, even during his Presidency;
nor indeed was he seen at all except on
horseback, or by his friends or visitors in
t his own house. With manners apparently
Spopular and informal, he led a life of his
own, and allowed few persons to share it.
His tastes were for that day exclusively
refined.. lHi instincts were those ot a
liberal European nobleman, like the Duc de
Laincourt, and he built for himself at Mon
ticello a chateau above contact with man.
The rawness of political life was an inces
sant torture to him, and personal attacks
made him keenly unhappy. His true de
light was in an intellectual life of science
and art. To read, write, speculate in new
lines of thought, to keep abreast of the
Intellect of Europe, and feed upon Homer
and Horace, were pleasures more to his
mind than any to be found in a public
assembly. He had some knowledge of
mathematics, and a little acquaintance with
classical art; but he fairly revelled in what
he believed to be beautiful. and his writings
often betrayed subtile feeling for artistic
form-a sure mark of intellectual sensuous
ness. He shrank from whatever was rough
or course, and his yearning for sympathy
was almost feminine. That such a man
should have ventured upon the stormy
ocean of politics was surprising, the more
because he was no orator, and owed nothing
to any magnetic influence of voice or per
son. Never effective in debate, for seven
teen years before his Presidency he had not
appeared in a legislative body except in the
chair of the Senate. He felt a nervous
horror for the contentiousness of such as
semblies, and even among his own friends
he sometimes abandoned for the moment
his strongest convictions rather than sup
port them by an effort of authority..r
