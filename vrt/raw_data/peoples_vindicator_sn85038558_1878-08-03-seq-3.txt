to speRak, tid ias a maitter of hlistory ce
I want to give yon my decided recol- of
lections about the Hlainptol Riands ai
commtuissioon. V
I was, as you may iemlemniber, in the e
Hlouse of Representativel , at on iti- d
llmate teris with C(ol. Johni B. Bald
win. Sonic lime in the year 1564 (I a
clanot irnembniher the exact date bit, t
probably, in Noeinbei ) at the close t.
of a night session, MIr. B;aldwin asked a
ume to take a walk with hun, saying,
"whel we got out on the Capitol e
groiunds, thatt a ceisiS had comie and
sometlhing must be done ; "but," said
he, "for the first time in my life I feel
that I lack moral courage to do lly
duty. He then went on to say that at
I determined stanid ought to be made I
3 for peace, but, knowing Mr. Davis as
lie did, hie feared nothing could be
Sdone with them. Said he, "I have
r con Gen. Lee, who gave me to t un
"derstand distiuctly that thle cause had
to fail." Col. Baldwin, as you re
i- memnber, was, during the first year of
the war, in the armty and under Gen.
Lee, and was oil mast intimatelC terms
ewith him.
p Upon consulltation it was agreed
4that Mr. Baldwin should, the next
day, introduce in thie House, in secreet'
session,. a resolution for the appoinut
ment of a coWmnittee to inquile into
our resources and ability for carrying
O on the war. This lie did, and the coin
mittee was appointed. Mr. Baldwin
was chairlman, and I was iput on the
- cotmititee. Thlis committee took
r omuch proof-mainly otfficers of the
is army, and, among otlhers, we exanin
to ed Gen. Lee., I sipposte his deposi
tion can be found at Washington.
He prove d that the army was daily
n being reduced, and that Gen. Grant's
41 arly WRas daily being ,trengtheined,
and Ithat it ws oly a questuonl of
V time as to giving up Rihmlaundl, and
Y when lie retire his army could not
be asuouied for lack ot supplies.
Col. Baldwin put the question to him pr
direct, it Ih C'ld matke no huggestioils th
