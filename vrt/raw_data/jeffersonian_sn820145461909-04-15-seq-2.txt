’M tired. I have worked
like a slave without re
sult, and now I’m going
to stop. Why should I
wear myself out merely
to learn how to put my
few thoughts on paper?
I have read book after
book; I have studied style
after style, and yet my best efforts
are clumsy, without the attraction
which we sometimes find in peculiar
bluntness. I remind myself of a man
who has exhausted his strength in
trying to lift a ponderous log; and
though my vigor is dead, my yearning
is still alive. I have never thought,
as so many foolish men and women
do, to make a living by my pen. My
ambition has had no grander flight
than the hope of gracefully and forci
bly expressing myself in pure Eng
lish; but when I have looked at my
lines I have found them awkward,
and when I have weighed my
words I have found them light.
Everything I read puts me to shame.
Here, in a foolish little story, is a
sentence of which I would never have
thought—an idea which I could not
have conceived. I will worry with
my pen tonight, but tomorrow I will
throw it away.”
“Mr. Balkin,” said old man Gate
wood, appearing in the door, “I’ve
jes’ fetched some fresh water frum
the spring. Won’t yer try er few
lines, ez the feller says'?”
“No, thank you.”
“Still writin’ 1 ?” the old man
asked, stepping into the room.
“Yes.”
“Well,” said the old fellow, plac
ing the bucket of water on a chair
and glancing at a pile of manuscript,
“what makes yer do it? Yer ain’t
er county clerk, air yer?”
“Oh, no; I only write for my own
amusement.”
“Don’t ’pear ter me thar’s so pow.
erful much ’musement in a feller
humpin’ hisse’f thater way.”
“To tell you the truth, Mr. Gate
wood, there isn’t much amusement in
it. Wait a minute,” he added, as
the old man took up the bucket. “Can
vou give me any kind or work to
do?”
“W’y, bless yer life, me an’ Jim
does all the work, ez the feller says.
Thar ain’t much ter do on this here
po ’ place. Good night.”
Mr. Anderson Balkin, a school
teacher in the neighborhood of Blue
Fork, Ark., had, when the term of
his school expired, engaged board
with the family of Andrew Gate
wood, an old fellow who knew but
little of the world and who eared
less; a man whose idea of happiness
was to have his own way, and whose
religion was hard work. He was a
powerful man physically, slightly
stooped as though unable to entirely
straighten up from the memory of
having set out so many sweet-potato
slips. His whiskers were as stiff and
as grizzled as the stuffing of a buggy
cushion; his nose, crooked and sharp,
partook of the shape of a scythe,
and his eyes, never wide open, had a
peculiar squint, as if dodging the rays
of the sun. His wife was pale and
thin, a fair type of the Southern

backwoodsman’s wife —a woman who
was the slave of an old-fashioned
fire-place; who, at evening, when bull
bats bellowed, sang a melancholy
song. She had never known a day of
pleasure, had never seen a star of
promise. Gatewood had two daugh
ters and a son. One of the daughters
was a widow, and the younger one
was a handsome, delicate girl. This
girl, Emily, had gone to school to
Balkin, and it is not idle to conjecture
that she was the cause of the teach
er’s presence in the household.
“Balkin wants ter work fur us,”
said the old man when he entered the
sitting-room.
“Mighty po’ work he ken do,” re
plied Jim, a rough, burly fellow, who
sat greasing hame-strings. “Reckon
he ain’t got no money an’ sorter
wants ter pay his boa’d. Em ken
do that, kain’t yer, Em?”
‘/Now, Jim, I want yer ter hush
an’ let me erlone. All time pickin’
at me anyway.”
“Hush, Jimmie,” said Mrs. Gate
wood. “Don’t pester the chile.
Pap,” addressing her husband, “wush
yer’d han’ me down them socks. Up
thar on the mantel, turned inter one
’nuther. ”
The old man did as requested; then,
after sitting down, taking off his
shoes and striking them together over
the hearth, he said:
“Whut do all this mean ’bout Em
payin’ boa’d?”
“Ax Em,” Jim replied with a
snort.
The old man turned to Emily,
looked at her steadily and said:
“Don’t let us have no foolishness.”
The timid girl trembled and blushed
beneath his gaze. “I said don’t let’s
have no foolishness. Ain’t thinkin’
’bout marryin’ him, air yer? W’y,
he ain’t no ’count, an’ ’sides that
he’ll be dead with consumption ’fore
six months; but that ain’t the wust
uv it. Sets thar er scratchin’ an’ er
clawin’ all day an’ ha’f the night
like er ole turkey gobbler.”
“He ain’t like er ole gobbler if
he scratches at night, fur er gobbler
goes ter roost at night,” the girl
replied.
“Fur pity sake,” said Mrs. Gate
wood, “don’t talk so loud; he’ll hear
yer. ’ ’
“Ain’t keerin’ much es he does,”
the old man replied. “It mout I’arn
him some sense. No wonder he’s got
consumption. Never done ernuff work
ter move his blood. Em, I’d ruther
see yer dead than ter see yer marry
sich er thing ez he is. Always er
scratehin’ round an’ er hackin’ an’ er
coughin’. Had er went ter work
like Jim, thar, he wouldn’t never
coughed none. Em, look at yer sister,
thar —er widder in .the house. No
thin’ would do her but she must marry
er fly-up-the-creek. Now look at her
—er widder in the house. Thar, now,
Sue, don’t blubber, fur yer air er
widder in ther house. Done ez I tole
yer in the fust place, yer wouldn’t
been er widder, but no, yer must
have yer own way an’ momox the
whole musiness. I’ll see Balkin in
the mawnin’ an’ tell him I don’t
want no foolishness ez the feller
says. Jim, think it’ll rain?”
“Feard not; the win’s shifted.”

“B’lieve I’ll step out an’ see.
Don’t have a shower putty soon the
turnips never will come up.”
Emily arose and noiselessly fol
lowed her father. “Pap,” she said,
when she had closed the door, “I wish
yer wouldn’t hurt Mr. Balkin’s feel
in’s. Es yer don’t want him ter stay
here tell him ter leave, but don’t tell
him why. Please don’t, pap.” She
placed both her hands on the old
man’s arm. He moved impatiently,
brushed her hands from his arm, and
replied:
“I’ve got mighty nigh ernuff sense
ter ten’ ter my own business.”
“It is my business, too,” she said,
with a calmness that startled him.
“The hell yer say! Look here, I
don’t want no foolishness don’t
want no mo’ widders in the house.”
“He’s axed me ter marry him, an’
I’m goin’ ter do it, ’cause I love him
so.”
“Em, yer’ve heard that I killed er
man, haven’t yer?”
‘‘ Yas, sir.”
“Wall, when yer marry that feller
yer’ll hear uv me killin’ ernuther. I
ain’t got no particular ’jeckshuns ter
him ez laung ez he don’t fool with
my erfairs, ez the feller says, but
when he do, I settles with him then
an’ thar.”
The girl sank down upon the door
step. “Git up,” he said, touching
her with his foot. “No foolishness;
no mo’ widders in the house.”
Early the next morning Gatewood
sought Balkin, whom he found in the
woods nea¥ the house.
“Mr. Balkin,” said he, “I want
you to un’erstan’ that I don’t want
no foolishness.”
“What do you mean?” Balkin
asked, in astonishment.
“I jes’ mean this, ez the feller
says —mean that I don’t want no mo’
widders in the house —mean that you
shain’t marry Em.”
Balkin placed his hand on a sap
ling, as if to support himself, lifted
his large, sad-looking eyes, in which
there burned an unnatural light, gazed
fixedly at. the old man, and replied:
“I have asked her to be my wife,
and she has consented.”
“That don’t make a blame bit uv
difference,” Gatewood impetuously
broke out. “I say you shain’t marry
her, an’ you shain’t. W’y, blast it,
you’ll be dead with consumption ’fore
five months.”
“The contempt with which you
speak of my unfortunate condition
is inhuman, but as you know not the
feelings of a refined man, 1 will not
argue with you. Say that I am near
my grave, but do not permit that to
shut out another truth, that Emily is
not long for this world, and that our
separation might hasten her death.
As you hope for peace in the world
to come, do not drive me away. Let
me remain here where”
“I’ve done said what I had to say;
you must git away from here right
now/”
“May I bid Emily good-by?”
“No. Stay here, an’ I’ll fetch
your duds.”
He soon returned, bringing Balkin’s
scanty wardrobe and papers. “Now,
clear out. ’Pears like the devil his
se’f is tryin’ ter run my erfairs.”
Balkin looked toward the house,
hoping to catch sight of Emily, and
then, disappointed, he slowly turned
away. He had proceeded but a short
distance along the rugged road, wind
ing among the trees, when Emily sud
denly appeared before him. Balkin
dropped his bag and caught her in his
arms.
’ “Angel,” he said, “you must come
with me.”
“Oh, I kain’t,” she sobbed. “If
I do, pap’ll kill you. Don’t say
nothin’ mo’,” she begged, convulsive
ly clinging to him. “Don’t, don’t!
Go on away, an’ some time you’ll
come back fer me. I don’t know
why, but something tells me so. Thar,
good-by. ’ ’
Mrs. Gatewood sat under the morn
ing-glory vines singing a melancholy
song. Emily approached and seated
herself on a box near her mother.
“Ma,” she said, when the song
was hushed, “I am gittin’ so weak I
kain’t hardly walk.”
“Hush, darlin’, an’ don’t talk
thater way, sores pap hears yer he’ll
get mad.”
“But, ma, don’t yer see how I
cough ? ’ ’
“Yes, precious, but don’t say
nothin’.”
At the breakfast table the next
morning old Gatewood said: I hear
that Balkin is over at Frazier’s flat
uv his back. He staid at Dalton’s
nearly fo’ munts. I b’lieve folks bring
all that sorter thing on therselves.
Whut air yer hackin’ and’ coughin’
thater way fer, Em? Tryin ter ack
like Balkin?”
“Pap,” Mrs. Gate wood timidly re
plied, “the chile kain’t he’p it.”
“Wall, now, yer see yer don’t
know ez much erbout that ez I do.
Don’t want to hear no mo’ uv that
barkin’, Em. Hear me?”
“Yas, sir.”
“Wall, mind whut I tell yer. Sue,”
turning to the widow, “hain’t yer
been puttin’ her up ter all this?”
“No, pap, I hain’t.”
“Wall, yer better not.”
After breakfast, while Gatewood
was scratching among a lot of old
chains and scrap-iron in the smoke
house, looking for a jumping-coulter,
Jim came in, shut the door, placed
his back against it, and said:
“Pap, I wanter say suthin’ that
might not soun’ like er fiddle. I
wanter tell yei’ that es yer ever say
anything else to Em erbout coughin’,
that we’ll mix right then an’ thar.
Hold on; yer neenter fly off’n the
handle, fur dam’s we don’t mix,
shore’s the devil made sin.”
“Yer triflin’ rascal, I”
“That’s all right, pap. Yer ken
say whut yer please ter me, but jis’
open yer head ag’in ter that po’ little
gal erbout coughin’, an’ by the time
I git through with yer then an’ thar,
yer hide won’t be able ter hoi’ ernuff
wheat straw ter tickle er cat with.
Jis’ mark whut I tell yer.”
“Damn yer fool soul, I ken whup
yer in ten minits!” the old man hotly
exclaimed.
“That’s all right, pap. I’m glad
ter see that yer’ve got sich er good
erpinion uv yerse’f, but all the same
yer know that I ken wallop the day
