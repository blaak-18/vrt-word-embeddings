Deputy Sheriff Billaud. Burl was suspectcd
of being the cowardly assailant of Felix
Landry a few days ago. Mr. Landry iden
tified him and stated that he was positive
that Burl was thp right man. There are
other circumstances which point to him as the
guilty party.
The rapid progress being made by the
Pelican band under the leadership of Prof.
Henri Gerac should be a source of much
satisfaction to the people of this town. The
members of the band have so far shown the
proper spirit and the regularity with which
they practice and the harmony which pre
vails at all times among the boys lead us to
believe that their organization will not be
as short-lived as its predecessors.

The Gazette is happy to make
the announcement that the work of
building the refinery is going on
speedily. A number of the towns
people who visited the site during
week were agreably surprised to see
so much already accomplished.
Sheriff Broussard went to Rayne
last Wednesday and arrested Sie

whertever given an opportunity.
Henry MI. Payne who killed L.
M. Ferris at Franklin on the x8th
of January was placed on trial last
Monday. Mr. Payne is wealthy
and highly connected. He is rep
resented by Judge Fesner and the
whole St. Mary bar with the excep
tion of Mr. Mentz. The State is
represented by District Attorney
Gordy and James WVilkinson, the
latter of New Orleans.
We have read the report of J. K.
Kitchell, superintendent of schools
of the parish of Vermilion, and we
must say that it is one of the best
documents of that kind that we
have ever read. The Gazette
thinks that Superintendent Toll
should make a similar report to the
School Board at the close of every
scholastic year. Superintendent
Kitchell, of Vermilion, gives in his
report, the condition of every
school house in his parish, the re
pairs needed, etc.
The following clippel from the
Times-Democrat's account of
Payne's trial at Franklin shows that
our bright young district attorney,
M. T. Gordy, intends to hold up
his end of the rope with his accus
tomed vim and ability. Although
Mr. Payne is defended by Senator
Caffery Andctidiary all the rienilbers
of the Franklin bar, it is*safe to say
that the interests of the State will
not suffer under the watchful eye
of Mr. Gordyi
The next names drawn from the
box proved to be those of Agricole
Fuselier, John F. False and O. W.
Brown. Juror Brown could either
"convict or acquit" on the street,
but duidek oath he would be guided
by the evidence. The State here
upon challenged Brown for equivo
cation and contradiction in the ex
amination. Counsel for the de
fense, Senator Caffery, objected to
the disqualification of the juror and
claimed that the overheated zeal of
the district attorney led him to see
disqualifications where none existed.
The district attorney, Mr. Gordy,
repiled that lie was i. court to per
form a simply duty, and that no as
persions could swerve him from a
determination to secure fair-minded
and honest jurors. He believed
that the juror had equivocated, and
even if the court ruled against him
he would still believe it. Mr. Caf
fery disclaimed any intention of
casting any reflections.
A Pioneer's Recommendation.
Mr. J. WV. Venable, of Downey,
a pioneer of Los Angeles County,
Cal., says: "Whenever I am
troubled with a pain in the stomach
or with diarrhoea I use Chamber
lain's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy. I have used it for years,
known it to be a reliable remedy,
and recommend it to every one."

Last Wednesday we visited the
office of a bachelor friend and
found on his desk a book entitled
*"Habits of Good Society, etc.,"
and in the table of contents we read
"the spirit of social abservances,"
'what is society?" "taking a li
berty," "honi soit qui mal y pense,"
"the art of making one's self agrea
ble," "the teeth," "the beard"
"true cosmetics", etc. We said
nothing, but the recent movements
of our esteemed friend coupled with
the discovery of this very suggestive
book on his desk inclined us to the
belief that there yet lingers in his
lonely heart that hope which is the
last thing that dies in man.

A New Road.
Thanks to the efforts of Mr. J. A.
LaNeuville and some neighbors, a
good road has been traced and put
in traveling condition. The road s
quite long and runs from Mr.
LaNeuville's to Hon. Overton
Cade's plantation. A bridge of
considerable magnitude had to be
erected over the pond near Hilaire
Savoy's place; it is ten feet wide,
four feet high and eighteen long.
Near the pond of Norville Vincent
it was necessary to make a four-feet
levee of a mile long. The parish
furnished the lumber. It required
a great deal of energy to complete
this road which will be of immense
benefit to the people living in the
section through which it runs.
Razors at Biossat's.
Among the numerous persons
who have been cured of rheumatism
by Chamberlain's Pain Balm, men

Thorne, of Toledo, Wash., who
says: "I have never been able to
procure any medicine that would
relieve me of rheumatism like
Chamberlain's Pain Balm. I have
also used it for lame back with
great success, It is the best lini
ment I have ever used, and I take
pleasure in recommending it to my
friends." For sale by all druggists.
A negro attempted to force an
entrance into the Rigues Hotel dur
ing the night of last Sunday. At
about 3 o'clock in the morning Mrs.
Bellocq heard a peculiar noise com
ing from a window and she soon
ascertained the cause thereof. She
saw a negro's hand industriously
engaged in trying to lift the fas
tener. The would-be burglar had
passed his hand through the blinds
and in this way had succeeded in
partly opening the window, but luck
ily another fastener placed a little
higher prevented him from effecting
an entiance before being discovered
in his evil work. There have been
several attempts at burglary lately
and unfortunately none of the
thieves have been caught, with the
exception of those implicated in the
Plonsky robbery. There are alto
gether too many idle negroes in this
town and unless they make up their
minds to behave a little better the
white people may some day take a
notion to pursuade them to do so.

Sunday's Picnic.
The society whose name is un
known and whose mission seems to be
a weird and unfathomable my stery,
gave a picnic last Sunday. It was
a well-managed affair and we be
lieve thoroughly enjoyed by all who
were present. About forty five
persons attendcd and spent the day
in Girard's woods. Among the
guests weret Misses Mamie and
-Berth Higgins, Marie and Louise
Revillon, Nellie Bailey, Hortense
and Cora Guidly, Lorina Marsh,

Pilette Again on Top.
The Pilette boys are again victo
rious. They played the St. Martin
ville club last Sunday and the way
they "did up" the latter reminded
one b'f the game played at Oak
Avenue Park on the 4th of July
when the Nine Devils of Lafayette
were so badly beaten that they have
not yet recovered from the effects
of the defeat. Our Pilette friends
hive proven their superiority over
the neighboring clubs and it is now
in order for them to look after big
ger game.
Last Sunday the St. Martinville
boys came over to Pilctte and a
very interesting contest took place,
resulting in a score of 30 to 14 in
favor of Pilette. The pitcher of the
St. Martinville club was sick and
was unable to take part in the
game. To this fact the St. Martin
ville boys attribute the easy victory
of their opponents.
After the game was concluded the
Pilette boys treated the visiting
club and their friends who had
come to witness the game to a splen
did dinner. It is estimated that
nearly zoo persons were seated at
the large table which had been
erected in the Broussard hall. It
may not be amiss to say that during
and after the game perfect good
humor prevailed. The Pilhtte boys
were delighted with the cordiality
and gentlemanly bearing of their
guests and it is their earnest wish
that they will soon have occasion to
meet again in friendly rivalry.
During the evening the genial Gab
Gardemal, of St. Martinville, fa
vored the crowd with some catchy
songs rendered in his own inimit
able style.
'We had an epidemic of dysentery
in this vicinity last summer," says
Samuel S. Pollock, of Briceland,

suffered severely until some one
called my attention to Chamber
lain's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy. I procured a bottle and
felt better after the first dose. Be
fore one-half ot the bottle had been
used I was well. I recommended
it to my friends and their experience
was the same. We all unite in say
ing it is the best." For sale by all

Carencro rejoices that Lafayette
has at last made satisfactory ar
rangements for the estaolishment
of a sugar refinery in the latter
place. It will render the farmers
in that vicinity independent of dis
tant mills, and enable them to han
dle and deliver their crop at a much
lower cost. It will necessarily in
crease the amount of money in cir
culation in the place, as it will give
employment to a large number of
hands. It also denotes a dawn of
enterprise, which if followed up,
will place Lafayette in the lead of
the many progressive towns of
Southern Louisiana, which lack the
favorable location and wonderful
natural resources enjoyed by that
place. Concert of action, was all
that was lacking to accomplish this
result. The ball has been started.

DIED,
Wednesday night at zo:zo, Mrs.
Thos. D. Coleman, born Cecile
Philomene Mouton, aged 36 years.
The death of this estimable lady
was learned with deep regret and pro
found sorrow by many people out
side of her family. There was not
a better Christian, a truer friend, a
more devoted mother and wife than
the deceased. It is hard to realize
that that once happy home which
was the abode of human happiness
is now in the midst of sorrow. It is
there she will be missed. It is in
that humble home her virtues shone,
and now that she is gone, it is those
who are left that well feel her loss;
they, alone, know what a cruel
blow has been stricken; they need
no eulogy to tell them of the dead
one's worth, and words can not as
suage their grief. Death has
brought that grief to them and
death only will end it.
