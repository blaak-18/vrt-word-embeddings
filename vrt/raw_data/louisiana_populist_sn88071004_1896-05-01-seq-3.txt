We understand that several pe
titions are being circulated to have
certain iparties appointed City Mar
shall. We presume that Mr. Gre
teaux can appoint one without any
petition. We have never heard
any complaint against the present
city marshall, and he can be re
moved or retrined without a peti
-tion. We feel asg'urt d that. Mr.
Grenueanx will act for the best in
terest of the city, and not for Ipoli
ticians.
We are offering M. A. Simmron's

" 1 II Il/lilnMiil1111! I lt
Ibervllle Again.
This morning we were asrain en
lightened as to Iberville. Yester
day the Times-Democrat told us
that the vote of Iberville stood
thus
For Foster. For Pharr.
1467 267
This would give Foster a majority
of exactly 1200.
This morning we are told by the
Times-Democrat that the vote of
Iberville stainds thus:
For Foster. For Pharr.
3067 267
This gives Foster a majority of ex
actly 2800.
To-morrow we shall doubtless
find in the T.-D. the following Iber
ville figures :
For Foster. For Pharr.
3867 267
This will give Foster a majority of
exactly 3600, which is 400 loss thin
the number required by the order
of Chairman Parker.
The observant reader, and
Mlesrs. Davis and Rapier, of the
Picayune, together with Messrs.
Walker, Pool and Baker of the
Times-Democrat, will note the
persistence of the "67" in these
returns. They will also note the
persistence with which an even
number of hundreds appears as
Foster's majority. For one solid
week after the election the Foster
vote stood at an even 1800 in both
the Pic and T.-D. Yesterday
mo:ning the T.-D. discovered that
Pharr had received 247 votes (note
the "67") and Foster 1467 (again
note the "6T"). This gave Foster
yesterday a majority of exactly
1900.
But to-day the T.-D. tells us
that Foster's vote in Iberville was
8067 (keep your eye on. the "67,"
gentle reader), while Pharr's vote
was 267 (don't take your eye off
the "67," it mirht run away). Tl.is
gives Foster a majority of 284 0
even.
And we are further told in the
T.-D. this morning, in a telegram
from Plaquemine, the parish seat
of Iberville, that the official re
turns of the election in Ilerville
have been forwarded by the so
pervisors to the Secretary of 8take.
The Item does not believe a word
of this. That there are election
thieves in Ibervilie not even the
friends of Sheriff Browne and De
pWty Lomsnadeny, but we doubt
wh4ter they have the nerve to
eesmait barefaced perjury, which
thbq mast have done if tbese re
pate returns have been forward
ied ith Sel ear y of State.

LAKE END, LA.,
Ap:il :5t, 189t6.
Eior L'u.i-i:na Populist :
I h t,- been informed that the
report is being circulated through
out Natchitoches parish that I in
a speech at Jno. W. C:lrnes store,
Saturday, April the 18th, 189E6, ad
vised the negroes to go to the polls
armed and protect their votes.
This report is a base falsehood. I
advised the negroes to leave the
polls immediately after voting,
that if there were any differences
to settle, it would be settled by the
white people. I told them further
that in every conflict that had ever
come up between the races, the
colored man had suffered, and for
them to get advice from their
white friends as to how to vote.
This is the sum and substance
of the advice I gave the colored
men present.
Respectfully,
D. G. FREEMAN.
P. S. The undersigned gentle
men were present and heard D. G.
Freeman speak, and corroborate
the above statement.
Signed : C. H. Webb.
W. P. W~ebb.

Some folks are very hot over
the charge made by the Daily Item
that the telegraphic communica
tion was cut off from Natchitoches.
If it is not true, what does the
following mean i
BULLETIN FROM NATCHITOCHES.

Hon. D. C. Scarborough went

The quiet old city of Natchitc

with s Battalion of the State Mi
litia and a Gatling Gun-to back
up a little dirty wo:k' of some
dirtier politicians.
When the nailitia reached this
place they vainly inquired for the
turbulent negro and the wild-eyed
Populists.
They were surprised to learn
the true origin of the trouble, and
that all of the men they were ask
ed to quell, were law-abiding white
men.

State Platform
People's Party. of Louisiana.
1. We affirm our allegiance to
the pure princip)les of po4pular _ov
ernment, as enunciated by Wash
ington, Jefferson and Jackson, and
embodied in our National platform,
and we uphold the principle em
bodied in the immortal declaration
that this should be "a Government
of the people, by the people andt
for the people."
2 And especially tdo we de
mand the free andl unlimited coin
age of both gold and silver, at the
ratio of 16 to 1, with equal debt
paying power as primary money,
and a full legal tender monetary
system for the people of the Unit
ed States, without consulting any
foreign nation or money syndicate.
3. We demand for Louisiana
industries equal protection to that
afforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit
ish system of commercial laws,
that no discrimination against our
agricultural and industrial classes
may be made.
4, We favor a just and liberal
system of public schools for the
benefit of all classes of our people,
and we deplore the fact that for
many years the management of
our public school system has been
so defective that the party now in
power seeks to disfranchise a large
number of our citizens on the
grounds of ignorance.
5. We denounce th disgrace
ful and infamous election frauds
which have prevailed in Louisiana,
and we demand and are determin
ed to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall cast his bal
lot freely and secretly, and the
vote shall be fairly counted as they
are actually cast. This is the su
preme issue in this campaign, and
in its success the honor, manhood
and prosperity of Louisiana are
involved. The foul and loathsome
methods which have brought the
ballot box stuffer to the front, antd
placed him in power in Louisiana,
must, in the name of liberty, jus
tice, morality and common decen
cy, be suppressed.
6. We oppose and denounce the
proposed suffrage amendment, con
cocted by political schemers, not to
purify and elevate the ballot box
but to subserve their selfish pur
poses by providing contradictory
qualifications, to suddenly disfran
chise large masses of worthy citi
zens, by deluding the people with
promises of changes in the next
Legislature. We denounce Othe
whole amendment as a vicious
fraud which proposes measures and
methods that are un-American and
destructive of free institutions.
7. We favor the utmost econo
my of expenditures, in State, city
and parish, and pledge our candi
dates to a strict and impartial en
forcement of all laws, and the pres
ervation and promotion of every
interest in Louisiana, whose wel
fare is broader and more sacred
than party lines or partisan poli
cies'; and we invite and urge the
true men and .honest citizens of
Louisiana, without regard to past
party affiliations to join with us in
a noble, patriotic and powerful ef
fort to relieve our people and to
elevate the standard of politics
and public morality in our beloved
State.
