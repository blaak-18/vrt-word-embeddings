WATSON AT SYLVANIA.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson spoke at
Sylvania today to an audience of
about eight hundred. There were
many ladies of the town and from
different sections of the county who
came to hear Mr. Watson. He spoke
in the court house and it was tilled to
its capacity, and, after every avail
able seat was occupied—even the
windows —men continued to come in
till there was no more standing room
to be had.
Both the banks closed, as well as
the stores, and the Prof, of the High
school, W. A. Ingram, gave an inter
mission that the teachers and pupils
might have an opportunity to hear
him. He was introduced by Senator
E. K. Overstreet.
There is no doubt that he made
many votes by his visit here, and his
friends claim that he will carry the
county by a good majority.
He was the guest last night of Mr.
J. C. Hollingsworth, Jr., a promising
young attorney here, and was enter
tained at dinner by Mr. W. J.
Walker, President of the Citizens’
bank of Sylvania, and of the Citi
zens’ trading company.

MR. WATSON AT DUBLIN.
Dublin, Ga., Oct. 17, 1903.
The Jeffersonian:
At the Chautauqua auditorium in
our city yesterday, Mr. Watson was
greeted by two thousand hearers.
Although fifteen years have elapsed
since Mr. Watson delivered a politi
cal address here, the immense audi
ence greeted him with greater en
thusiasm than ever. The , entire
audience seemed to be there to listen,
and he had an opportunity to pre
sent a high toned argument on Na
tional issues, which opportunity was
made use of in a manner character
istically Mr. Watson’s. There were
noticeably many supporters of Mr.
Watson who were never known to
support him before —which is due to
the fact that the people have grown
to understand the issues and to ap
preciate Mr. Watson’s great ability
and purpose.
Mr. Watson spoke of the power
once held by statesmen of the South
in National affairs and how it was
lost to the Republicans. How the
South has remained poor in com
parison to the overly rich East under
Republican favoritism, and how he
would like to stamp the political life
out of the party.
Mr. Watson also pointed out the
intentions and purposes of the
original Democratic party of Jef
ferson and how it has grown under
Bryan leadership to be exactly like
the Republican party—supported and
dominated by manufacturers, tariff
grafters and are just such support as
dominates the Republican partv.
Mr. Wat son’s appeal for support
was met with the most tumultuous ap
plause. Only one question was asked
Mr. Watson and his answer caused
a cor tinned applause and demonstra
lion that could not be misunderstood.
Mr. W atson’s victory could not have
been more perfect. Populism is fully
understood and undoubtedly the
favorite of Laurens county.
Respectfully,
CHAS, IT. KITTRELL,
From the Dublin Times, a Demo
cratic paper:
“After the speaking a large num
ber of Mr. Watson’s friends went
on the stage to shake his hand. The
sentiment of many was that the
speech won quite a number of votes
for the candidate. Opinions vary as
to whether he has sufficient strength
to carry the county, but there is no
question that he will poll a very
large vote in Laurens.”
The Hon. T. G. Dorough of Frank
lin county, Ga., Watson elector from
State-at-large, addressed an audience
of several hundred citizens of Ap
pling and adjoining counties assem
bled at a Tom Watson rally and in
the courthouse in Baxley, Ga., on
Saturday October 17th.
The rally seemed to be quite a
success from every standpoint.
The speaker made no attempt at
flowery flights of oratory; but his
steady flow of one political and his
torical truth after another was so
logically and eloquently expressed
that his hearers at once realized that
they had before them an orator of
more than average ability and states
manship, and gave him their un
divided attention throughout his
entire speech of about one hour and
fifteen minutes in length.
His speech was an explanation of
the differences between the Jeffer
sonian and the Hamiltonian princi
ples of government, and in the in
terest of the candidacy of the Hon.
Thos. E. Watson for the presidency,
who, he declared, is the only true
Jeffersonian Democrat in the present
race for the presidency. Also that
Mr. Watson is the only one of the
candidates who is a prohibitionist
except Mr. Chapin, the regular pro
hibition nominee; that Mr. Watson
had always worked for prohibition in
Georgia, but when it was an issue in
W. J. Bryan’s home state of Ne
braska, Mr. Bryan dodged the issue
by leaving the state.
The speaker further declared that
in 1896 and 1900 the Democratic
candidate, Mr. Bryan, stood for the
Jeffersonian principles, which is
another name for populism, that the
Farmers’ Alliance stood for and that
Mr. Watson has always stood for, but
that in 1904 he abandoned the peo
ple’s cause, and adopted the Hamil
tonian or Republican principles, and
that now he stands for the National
Banking system, its asset currency,
its periodic panics with all its oppres
sions of the people.
That the Republican party had al
ways stood for these Hamiltonian
principles, therefore, we could expect
nothing from the Republicans in the
way of permanent relief, though
Mr. Taft, the Republican candidate,
is showing 'more consideration to
ward the South on the race question
than Mr. Bryan, who has made over
tuers, or bids for the negro vote, if
we are to judge from admission and
circumstantial evidence that is very
strong, upon grounds that are re
volting to southern sentiment and
should he repudiated at the ballot
box on November 3rd. That this
means the putting the negro back in
politics to be used to defeat the will
of the white majorities in states
where they hold the balance of power.
That this would be worse for both
the negro and the white man. That
"Gift. 'Seffarsonian
the white man can govern the country
better for both races, therefore the
negro should not strive for political
and social equality as Bryanism
encourages them to do. That an in
telligent negro man, member df a
social equality club in New York, is
now making stump speeches for Mr.
Bryan.
The speaker touched a cord of
sympathy in the writer’s heart for
those southern born, but partizan,
citizens who still feel that they are
honor bound to support the regular
nominee of the Democratic party,
when he disclosed in such a vivid
manner, the humiliation heaped upon
the South and more especially upon
Georgia when the Bryanites of the
Denver convention tore (or attempt
ed to tear?) Georgians banner from
hordelegation, and heaped insult up
on insult by singing “Marching
Through Georgia” and having
the band play “Marching Through
Georgia.” To humiliate the South,
the Loyal South who for for
ty years has been furnishing
two-thirds of the electoral votes
of the party, and for no other reason
than because she had the presump
tion to ask for the second place on
the ticket.
The little state of Indiana in the
middle west which has only fifteen
electoral votes got the plum that the
South with her one hundred and
sixty-six electoral votes so modestly
asked for.
The speaker reminded us of Mr.
Watson’s unwavering loyalty to the
principles he now advocates, for
eighteen year’s and that all those
believing in the principles of Jeffer
son and of Jackson should vote for
him.

sonian, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I remember to have no
ticed in the Jeffersonian of Septem
ber 3 the editor’s request for brief
letters from all parts of the country,
etc. If any from this part was forth
coming. I am not apprised. Perhaps
those best informed have been too
busy or negligent to furnish the ed
itor with the desired information.
Therefore, T will, in my feeble way,
assume sponsorship for this once, hop
ing that I will not appear presump
t nous.
The Populists, or Jeffersonians, are
in the majority in this (Shelby) coun
ty. and the force is daily increasing.
For this fact, much credit is due Hon.
A. P. Longshore (our prohate judge),
who is now touring the district
speech-making, the effect of which
will be more appreciated by us old
Pops on election day, or at least when
we are officially notified that Watson
and Williams led the van in old Shel
bv county. I believe this will be
trim, and I believe that the Populists’
yell will be equal to the rebel yell of
yore.
But I desist. Suffice it to say that
the people are thinking and are
turning our way —to labor’s friends.
With best wishes and hopes for the
ultimate success of the People’s
Cause —hence your success —I am,
Very truly yours,
' M. S. LEE.
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.

forth with the proposition that they
then and there name a Silver man
for the Presidency, without waiting
for- the party conventions to come
later in June and July of 1896.
The proposal was unlooked for by
Mr. Bryan’s Silver fellows. It came
upon them like a pan of milk from
a top shelf.
Mr. Bryan counted on this. His
notion was that, while the others sat
tongue-tied, some one not threatened
by this unusual hominational plan
would struggle to his feet and do the
natural thing. That is, he would
offer the name of “William Jennings
Bryan” for that nomination, as
author of the sage proposal.
It is more than a chance that Mr.
Bryan’s programme would have car
ried itself out in happy fullness if it
hadn’t been for Senator Stewart, of
Nevada. Senator Stewart was ear
ned away by the Bryan proposition.
It was, he declared, the Silver thing
to do. The propaganda ought at
once to name a candidate for the
Presidency. Saying which, the ob
tuse Senator Stewart instantly put
in nomination Mr. Sibley, of Pennsyl
vania.
It ended Mr. Bryan’s interest in
that Silver propaganda.
About this time, on a day when the
House was holding a Sunday session.
Mr. Bryan came to me with a request
—in the nature of news.
“Would you mind saying in your
paper,” he asked, “that although the
House held a Sunday session, Mr.
Bryan, of Nebraska, at 1 o’clock in
the afternoon, repaired to the Con
gregational Church on Capitol Hill
and lectured an hour on the Divinity
of Christ?”
Mr. Bryan looked ashamed, not to
say sheepish. His humility, how
ever, did not move me. I had too
much at stake. I told him frankly
that it was impossible. I had reason
to think that my own rating on high
was not what I could wish, and I
didn’t care to further shake my all
too-flimsy standing in that eternal
quarter by helping him make a
personal political asset of the Throne
of Grade. —New York American.

Mv Dear Sir and Brother: En
closed please find some editorials and
ciinnings from our county newspaper.
I send these merely in order that you
mav know what is going on up in
Cobb.
I am so strong a lover of you and
your principles that I can hardlv keep
from having a contempt for any man
who says anything against you or
your cause.
1 heard you at Powder Springs on
September 25. Everybody was just
carried off their feet with your speech
there. Sinners repented (I mean or
ganized Democrats) and backsliders
returned. All I regretted was that
there were not more of them there
to hear the truth.
I do hope that you may live long
and enjoy good health so, you can
continue the good fight that you are
engaged in.
T was so glad that disfranchisement
carried.
I f you cau live to get the balance
