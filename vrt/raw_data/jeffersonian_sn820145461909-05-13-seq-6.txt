Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: In reply to your last
card appearing in your paper, the
Jeffersonian, April 16, I wish to say
that in no word, spoken or written,
about or to you, has there been the
slightest thought or intent; and in no
wise, nor under any consideration,
would I defame, vilify, scandalize or
injure any man on earth. For he who
robs another of his good name, has
robbed him of that which he can not
restore, and can only be attained by
the grace and favor of God. And in
saying what I have said, repeating
what has been said to me, and repeat
edly so, for 16 or more years, I spoke
in reference to same, honestly and
with all of the sincerity of soul. I
have no desire to criticize any one
with the intent of injuring. And to
prove to you and others that I have
not wilfully nor with any malicious
intent done so, I produce the follow
ing paper (affidavit) and other state
ments, in addition to the “certificate”
already having appeared in reference
to “lost papers” or said to be “lost
papers” which cover what I have said.
Affidavit.
The State of Texas,
County of Dallas.
1, Maggie A. Lambert (nee Roberts)
hereby make the following statement
under oath. After the death of my
grand-mother, Lucinda Starke (nee
Allison), of Walton County, Georgia,
whose estate was inherited by the
children of my mother, Mrs. Mary
Jane Roberts (nee Hi Usman), a
daughter of Lucinda Starke, by her
first husband; my father, A. J. Rob
erts, of at that time, Warren County,
Georgia (my mother having died be
fore my grand-mother) employed
Thomas E. Watson, an attorney at
law of Thomson, Georgia, to collect
the money coming to my mother ’s chil
dren, from my grand-mother’s estate,
the principal part or probably all of
the assets of said estate, as I under
stand it, having come to my grand
mother through inheritance from the
Gwynn Allison Estate; Gwynn Allison
having been the brother of my grand
mother’s father, and his estate con
trolled at that time by Ex-Governor
McDaniel, of Monroe, Georgia, who
refused to make any kind of a settle
ment, whatever, and Thomas E. Wat
son was employed by my father, A. J.
Roberts, to force a settlement and
accounting.
Valuable papers in the case were
turned over by my father to Thomas
E. Watson, among which, I have al
ways been told, was the last will and
testament of Gwynn Allison, and all
of those papers were claimed by Wat
son to have been lost. And he has
never made any accounting to any one
of us of his action in the matter, save
that he lost the papers intrusted to
him by my father.
Maggie A. Lambert.
On this 22d day of April, 1909, per
sonally appeared before me Mrs. Mag
gie A. Lambert, who is to me known,
and swore to and subscribed to the
above statement before me. In wit
ness of which, I hereby sign my name,
officially, and attest the action by the
impress of my notarial seal, this the
(bay and date above written,
Wm. M. Jones.
Notary Public, Dallas County, Tex.
Statements from letters addressed
to me in reference to the matter from
Mrs. Maggie A. Lambert:
She says, “Thomas E. Watson
was employed by my father and my
father turned over the deed to Mr.
Watson, and Mr. Watson gave my
father every,assurance that we would
get our money in a few weeks.”
Quoting from another letter from
Mrs. Lambert, “It was in the year
1876 my father employed Thomas E.
Watson to force McDaniel to settle
the estate of Gwynn Allison. I re
member very well of Mr. Watson’s
visit to our home, and at one time he
told my father he would soon have
the money, and in a month from then,
he told my father he had lost the
will.” Most respectfully,
C. A. Norton.

THE ORDINARY’S LETTER.
Greensboro, Ga., April 28, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Your letter of the 27th
inst. received. I am mailing you some
matter in reference to the estate of
Mr. Gwyn Allison which was admin
istered in our county.
1 find that the estate was involved
in litigation, and notes due the estate
were settled by compromise at a great
discount, and the bills of the various
banks itemized in the appraisement
were disposed of also at discount.
There were 257 acres of land sold at
public sale, which brought SI,OOO.
This was bought by my father. I
noticed this land.does not appear in
the sale return, but was sold by the
administrator and properly accounted
for in distribution. Greene County
recovered $4,400 as her part for the
education of the poor children of the
county in final settlement of the
estate. There is considerable matter
•of record, such as returns and orders,
and should you need anything more,
kindly state what you will most likely
wish.
There is no charge fir what I have
done. We expect to send you the will
of Gwyn Allison in a div or so. I
am writing with some difficulty, —have
been unwell for three weeks. I am,
Most truly yours,
(Signed) James H. McWhorter.
JUDGE HEARD’S LETTER.
Greensboro, Ga., April 29, 1909.
Dear Sir:
It has been exactly forty-four years
this day since Gwyn Allison made his
will, and I herewith enclose a copy
of that will to you. I believe this
estate never turned out as much as
$20,000, but you make the calculation
before you state it publicly. lam not
well enough to make the calculation
right now. There never was anything
wrong about its management at any
time. The character of the men con
nected with it all the time is against
any other view. Besides, the records
show correctness at all times.
Truly, etc.,
(Signed) Columbus Heard.

Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson,
Ga.:
Has the promise of prosperity
struck you people yet/? Mr. Taft was
lingering in the South so long that he
may have left a great blessing upon
the Southern people. What about
our Populist party 1 ? It seems like
these times would rouse the people to
reform action. In such times as these
in the past Populism made great leaps
forward; it gave us all enthusiasm
I am going to send you a lot of old
papers you can use and rest you up;
some splendid things in them. Can’t
you give my book a write-up and give
it a send-off so that somebody may
send for it? Will send it for sl, or
your paper one year and the book
price, the book at 80 cents, cost me
10 cents each for postage. I have a
hundred books and pamphlets on the
money and reform question for sale
cheap. I have 100 law books for sale,
dates from 1768 to 1899, cheap; have
40 Congressional Globes to sell; also

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I hope conditions are get
ting ripe for through organization
and union of all honest parties. Time
is valuable. Much it to be accom
plished. District, county and State
organizations should be rushed and at
work. National organizations can
rest a while. When you start national
organization, I’ve twenty-five dollars
for your expense account.
I think 'the Jeffersonians are
stronger and more effective detached
from “Taylor Trotwood’s.”
Herewith please find my check No.
237 for fifty dollars, stamps 10 cents,
for which please send me five Jeffer
sonian bonds. If the supply is not
exhausted I want five more in May.
Best wishes for your success and

A LETTER FROM MR. BRYAN.
Lincoln, Neb., March 12, 1909.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I desire to thank you for
your interest and assistance during
the campaign just ended. The elec
tion of the Republican ticket prevents
me from recommending to Congress
for enactment the principles enunci
ated in 'the Denver platform; but the
defeat should not dismay or discour
age those who are laboring unselfishly
for the promotion of good government.
I have again taken up my editorial
work on The Commoner which was
temporarily laid aside through the
campaign, and hope to have your con
tinued support of the paper in its
efforts to bring about legislation that
will better protect and promote the in
terests of the great masses of the
people.
Your subscription to The Commoner
is paid to the firsit of March, but I
trust that your interest in the success
of the principles for which we are
contending and the manifest impor
tance of keeping the progressive
Democrats throughout the country in
