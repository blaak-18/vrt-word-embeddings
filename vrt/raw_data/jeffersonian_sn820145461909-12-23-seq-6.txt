03 Additional Letters From the People
HERE IS A PREACHER WHOM I
LOVE.
My Honored Friend:—God bless
you and put His strong, protecting
arms about and keep you so that you
may carry your warfare on evil to a
finish. I believe God has raised you
up for this time. I’ll keep up with
all you are saying on all lines. I
think I have a clear head. You are
doing more good for the people of
this country than all the dailies and
religious papers I know of. I love a
man, and you are one. I told the
brethren, the Methodist preachers, at
their meeting that every one of them
ought to take your periodicals. I
wish I had a million to put behind
you. I would rather do it than to
put it anywhere else I know of. I
suppose you saw a little notice of
what I said at the meeting. We
have a lot of preachers who are not
posted, or afraid of Rome. I can’t
say which. I send you a little arti
cle which explains its purpose. They
refused to publish it. God bless you.
I am with you.
With love and highest esteem,
I am yours,
WILLIAM DUNBAR.
Atlanta, Ga.
’ (Do you know who William Dun
bar is? Well, he’s a Methodist
preacher. He is not only a Chris
tian, but he is every inch a man.
When that orgy of fraud and crime
was in progress in the Nineties, he
was stationed in Augusta, Ga. At
the risk of his life, he denounced the
Boykin Wright rascalities that were
disfranchising the country counties
of the Tenth Congressional District.
He stood at the polls, and witnessed
the repeating of votes, the buying of
ballots, the open, shameless bribery,
and the stuffing of the boxes. The
heelers threatened him with violence
if he did not go away. When I con
tested the election, this undaunted
Methodist preacher went on the wit
ness-stand, and testified to what he
had seen.
It took a man to do that in Au
gusta. But Dunbar did it; and he
had to pay the penalty for his inde
pendence.
I treasure your letter, William
Dunbar! You are of the salt of the
earth. As a warrior, you would have
deserved to be the standard-bearer
of Richard Coeur de Lion; as a sol
dier of the Cross, you are a credit to
John Wesley—as you would have
been to Luther or Knox.
May every friend of mine remem
ber you, and write to you a word of
cheer, and do everything in his or
herpporerw r er to prove that your courage
and loyalty are appreciated.

“ONLY EDITOR WHO TOLERATES
THE OTHER FELLOWS’ VIEWS.’’
Dear Sir:—You are the only editor
I know to tolerate the other fellows’
views. You are right. How else can
one form just conclusions without
hearing all the facts? The leading
politicians and political papers tell us
not what we want to know, but what
they want US to believe. They shuf
fle the cards so that we never can tell
where it, or they, are “at.” I, for
one poor devil, am glad to know that
we have one man who publishes the
truth without fear or favor or hope
of reward (in this life), and who is
generous in giving his opponents’
views in his paper.
Your comment on the prohibition
situation in Alabama covers all the
ground. Neither Anti nor Prohi can
do as they please, unless they please
to do right; but, ah! there’s the rub.
There must be a golden mean be
tween the two extremes; let us hope
that the lion will lie down with the
lamb, and all be at peace at last.
Yours truly,
JOHN S. COPPINGER.

T. E. W. ANSWERS SOME PER
SONAL QUESTIONS.
Hon. Tom Watson: —Your write
up of the buzzard awoke a reminis
cence in which a man, who claims to
be an ex-rebel—a Democrat and
everything else that is disreputable,
claims to have seen you red-headed
in the Georgia Legislature forty
years ago.
He claims that you are a sage,
whereas I claim that you have scarce
ly reached the age of discretion.
Now, you are no schoolgirl. You
are not ashamed to tell your age.
Just to settle a question in dispute,
how old are you, and have you got
red hair?
Yours truly,
W. T. WATERS.
Chattanooga, Tenn.
Answer.
It’s funny the way the Buzzard
essay struck popular fancy. Glad I
wrote him up. In his way, he’s a fine
old bird.
My red top might have been seen
in the Legislature in 1882 and 3
some 26 years ago. Can’t own up to
the 40 years ago. Was born in 1856.
You are right about the age of dis
cretion. Haven’t reached it yet, and
never expect to—if you mean
solemnity, stiffness, grouchiness, self,
complacency, painful prudence, and a
careful calculation of consequences.
Always expect to do and say what
seems right, -with a glorious, boyish
contempt of consequences.
Yep; hair red yet, or rather dark
auburn. Not enough gray in it to
alarm my friends and comfort my
enemies—though really there are
serious doubts about my having any
foes. I ain’t doin’ nuthin’ to nobody
—am I? T. E. W.
P. S. —When I have to buy a pair
of specs and a set of hand-made
teeth, will calm down and go slow.
And cultivate a beard.
A VOICE OF CHEER FROM MASSA
CHUSETTS.
Dear Sir: —I notice with great
pleasure that you purpose writing a
series of articles, or historical review
of the hierarchy. That is what the
country needs. It is surprising how
wonderfully ignorant the people are
regarding the true history of the or
ganization. In regard to the ques
tion, I wish to call your attention to
that wonderful work, in six volumes,
“Millennial Dawn,” by Mr. C. T. Rus
sell, No. 17 Hicks St., Brooklyn, N. Y.
Perhaps you are familiar with the
work and the author’s exhaustive
study of the hierarchy from a Biblical
and historical viewpoint, as set forth
in the second and third volumes, the
main facts of which you are familiar
with. But there are many facts of
The Jeffersonian
unusual interest seldom met with in
the ordinary study of secular history,
—although I realize that your study
has been extended far beyond the or
dinary course of historical students.
Mr. Russell’s fourth volume is won
derfully instructive in regard to the
Protestant “Federation of Churches,”
which is going on preparatory to co
operation with the hierarchy for po
litical strength and exchange of fa
vors with the powers that be.
We will soon have two great cleri
cal organizations, animated with the
spirit of Alva, and working together
for the overthrow of liberty and the
enthronement of intolerance. We still
have the “ism,” but the protest is
dead. The Protestant clergy, as a
whole, have no inclination to halt the
progress of Catholicity; on the con
trary, they are openly and secretly ad
vocating an amalgamation with the
old church, as Mr. Russell clearly
proves in his fourth volume, and the
“Federation conventions” demon
strate. The great falling away,
owing to progressive thought, their
persistency in adhering to unscrip
tural teaching, their affiliation with
capital against the masses, and the
nominal success of the mother, has
taught the daughter the necessity of
adopting her methods.
Watch the workings of the Feder
ation’s Easteron (New York), and
Westeron (Chicago) committee. For
their object is destruction to the fun
damental principles of liberty, for
the promotion of ecclesiastical in
terests.
God grant that you may be spared
to carry on the great work you have
so unselfishly, so nobly, and so cour
ageously devoted your life, and your
wonderful God-given talents to.
Fear not, neither be discouraged.
You are doing a great work, but like
all “great men,” through all the
ages, you must suffer the fruits of
human selfishness, indolence, ignor
ance and prejudice, and the pity of
it is, to all appearance, the glory
goes to the Morgans, who run their
race and sink into oblivion unsung
and unwept. God be thanked it is
not so with the former. The treat
ment may be harsh and cruel, the
marble cold and heavy, but they live,
live in the hearts of their fellow men,
a blessing to their loved ones and an
inspiration to mankind.

“THE POPE AND HIS IMPS.’’
My Dear Brother: —“The gospel
of Christ is the power of God unto
salvation to every one that believ
eth.” Romans 1: 16. This is true.
It is the only thing left sinful man
to guide him over the sea of life and
into the portals of the great beyond.
There is no salvation for the soul
of man except though the gospel.
This statement may not set well with
Papa (the Pope) and his imps, but
we have been fighting that Vicar of
Satan for a long time, and expect to
continue. We have him described in
2 Thess. 2: 3-8.
I firmly believe Romans 1: 16. I
firmly believe the gospel of Christ to
be the power of God unto salvation.
And just as firmly do I believe that
the principles of the Populist party
is the power unto salvation for the
American nation.
The old parties would, crucify us
to the cross of gold and greed
and the Catholics (traitors to Ameri
can principles) would burn us at the
stake, as they have in past ages, if
they only had the power.

READ HIS, AND THEN READ
MINE.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —If you are
not too busy I will ask you to answer
the following questions:
(1) Who is “General Stoneman”
that Th os. Dixon speaks of so often
in his book, “The Clansman?”
(2) Why is it that the “small,” or
“circuit-rider,” preacher, along in the
fall of the year, gets some “Big Ike,”
or station preacher, to preach to his
congregations?
I contend that General Stoneman
was Thad Stevens, but there are
those who differ with me.
He was a mighty smart little boy,
and he w T as named for you, Mr. Wat
son, and I sometimes think that he
would be with me yet, had I not had
one of those modern doctors treating
him. I 'tell you, Mr. Watson, I have
about lost faith in them.
