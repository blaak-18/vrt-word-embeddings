LOUISIANA RICE
THE UNION COMPANY WITH SIN
MILLION DOLLARS.
Will Assist in the Dev\-elopment of This
Industry-Irrigation on an Ex
tensive Scale Promised
New Orleans, Feb. 27.-The rapidly
increasing demand for Louisiana-grown
rice is attracting attention to the im
mense prairie wastes in this State which
only need irrigation to make them as
productive as any rice lands in the
world, and this has given a wonderful
impetus to the organization of irrigation
companies %g a large scale. The latest
and l: rgest company of this kind to be
formed is the Union Rice Irrigation
Company, the charter of which has just
been filed in New Jersey by J. H. Dill,
the attorney who looked after the or
ganization of the United States Steel
Corporation. The Union Company is to
have a paid-up capital stock of $6,000,000
a large portion of which has already
been placed among the rice growers of
this State. Dr. R. C. Webb oi Rayne,
La., one of the wealthiest rice men in
America, and who owns over 50,000
acres of rice land, is the prime mover in
the concern. He has been in the East for
several weeks completing arrangements
for organization, and has just returned
here. He experienecd no difficulty in
raising the capital necessary for carry
ing out the scheme which is by far the
largest of the kindi ever launched in the
world. George Bird Castles of Marietta,
Pa., a congressman of that State, has
been chosen president. He has large
financial interests in Pennsylvania and
is well known in trust circles in the
East. George W. Angle of New York
city, o fthe firm of Stewart, Simmoris &
Co., brokers, is the vice president. Dr.
Webb, who is president of the Rayne
Rice Milling Company, is the treasurer,
and George W. Sears of Crowley, La.,
i" the secretary.
The Intestate Trust and Banking
Compaany, a $2,ooo,ooo concern organ
itzed here'sa year ago, is acting as trustee,
and its president, W. P. Rogers, is a
large stockholder and will be one of the
directors of the irrigation company. The
stockholders of the new company will
hold their .first meeting in New Orleans
March 15, when directors and officers
will be elected.
The Union Company will dig a canal
fifty miles long, which will take its
wa-er from Bayou Coutableau, which is
a branch of the Atchafalaya river, which
is turn empties in the Mississippi river.
The canal will have its source in St.
Landry parish between Opelousas and
Washington and will water the great
Hayes and Marmon prairies, bringing
more than soo,ooo acres into rice culti
vation.
Close freight connections have been
made between the new company and the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, a
tap ofwhich extends through St. Lan
dry parish. Colonel S. F. B. Morse, pas
senger traffic manager of the Atlantid
system of this road, came over from
Houston this morning and spent several
hours in close consultation with Dr.
Webb, when it was announced a clear
working understanding was arrived at.
When it is known that the supply of
LouisiaM rice is this year about 60oo,ooo
pockets. short of the actual demabd, ne
cssitating heavy additional imports; and
that the profits on Louisiana-grown rice
are enormous, the importance of the new
a y becomes apparent.
It Itsnt probable any of the stock

HOMER FORT
A Son of Bossier in New York-Hi;
Success.
New York. Feb. 18.-North Louisianm
may be justly proud of her many son;
and daughters who have attained promi
nence in intellectual achievements ai
home and abroad. Even here in New
York, the Mecca of America, where
come those of every profession eagerly
seeking name and fame, and where only
the strongest and best achieve success
we find men and women from Louisiana
in the front rank. Among these is one
who has attained celebrity in literary and
newspaper circles-Homer Fort-one
of the most popular writers in New
York.
About twenty-three years ago Mr
Fort began his newspaper career in
Shreveport. Desiring a larger field, he
went to New Orleans. and finally came
to New York where his ability was soon
recognized. For several years he was
engaged on the leading dailies. He writes
pure English, both in prose and verse.
His versatility and great success as an
interviewer caused a constant demand
for his articles.
Mr. Fort has arrived at that happy
stage in a newspaper man's life whin it
is no longer necessary for himi to do
staff work. His articles find a ready ac
ceptance by the leading periodicals
throughout the country., Successful as
he has been in the past, the future
promises still greater, things. He has
lately written a play, which those who
have read the manuscript give Kim first
rank as a dramatist. A rich New Yorker
has shown his confidence in its success
by offering to "back" Mr. F6rt in its
production. Next 'fall the play will be
presented on the New York stage. Those
who are familiar with. Mr. Fort's lucid
Syle, keen wit, vivid imagination and
thorough knowledge of human nature
are sure of its success. X.

SHOVE 'EM OFF.
Why should any honest, sensible, fair
minded son of toil be misled by\ the
"clap-trap" of politicians, the political
time' servers, the man who has been
feeding and fattening at the public crib
and who pats the horny-handed oh the
shoulder or shakes his hand all for a
purpose.
As the Caucasian man is not an aspi
rant for any political office and expects
no "soft job" he would advise all work
ing men to "shove 'em off;" we mean to
let 'em know that you are "onto their
game" and that you are not going to be
"worked" with honeyed words, their

RIVER FORECAST.
Further rise in Red river at Arthur
City is problematical.
At Fulton the river is expected to rise
more or less during the next three days,
and again go above the danger line of
28 feet. Property should be fully pro
tected at all points.
Rate of rise at Shreveport will de
crease. but highest water will probably
be some 29 feet, expected by middle of
coming week with favorable weather.
Points immediately below Shreveport,
to be fin the side of safet-. should hbe
prepared for a 30-foot rise at Shreve
port.

The Bible and Its Coatents.
There are no less than 3,566,480 let

verses and 1,189 chapters.

To read the Bible through in a year
means reading three chapters every
weekday and five chapters each Sun
day.
All the letters of the alphabet are
contained in the twenty-first verse of
the seventh chapter of Ezra.
The Bible was not divided into chap
ters, as it is now, until the thirteenth
century. Early Hebrew Bibles were
marked into sections and verses by
means of accents, which served as
marks to be observed in the eastern
manner of reading. The work of dl
viding the Bible into chapters has been
attributed by some to Stephen Lang
ton. The division into verses was made
by a printer of the name of Robert
Stephens in 1548 and was adopted
throughout all editions.
The Americen Language.
"It used to be. considered a witticism
to ask a man whether he spoke United
States," said an English university
man at the Lawyers' club the other day,
"but there is in fact an American lan
guage, distinctive from the king's Eng
lish not only in idioms and in the use
of particular words, but in the clipping
of words to save time and breath. On
this side of the Atlantic one scarcely
ever hears 'I have' and 'you are.' You
hurrying Americans say 'I've' and
'you're.' You shorten up 'cannot' into
'can't,' and your purest speakers use
'on't' and 'won't,' and it is almost a
universal habit among Americans to
clip the 'g' off words ending in 'ing.'
Even your professord of English fail
to sound the 'e' in 'righteous' and 'cour
teous' and shorten 'knowledge' into
'knoledge.' I might recite scores of
words that are practically shortened
by a syllable in usage, and as usage
makes language you' Americans are
gradually constructing a speech that
is quite distinct from that form of
English which Oxford and Cambridge
are preserving with such eare."-New
York Times.
Psleen Lore.
No one can pretend to.any acquaint
ance with English literature or even
with the English language without be
ing aware how deep an impress has
been left upon them by the art and
practice' of falconry. Such words as
"haggard," "eyrie," "mews," "cadger,"
to "lure,", to "stoop," to "reclaim," all
belonged originally to the falconer's
jargon, and were thence adopted into
common parlance.
