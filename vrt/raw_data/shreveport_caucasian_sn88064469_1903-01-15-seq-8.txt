Livestock Asseeiatleo Pertained
to Protection of the In-.
distry in Future.
Kansas City. Jan. 14.-The sixth an
anal convention of the National Live
stock aeeodation began a four-day see
sla, at The Century theater here Tues
Sday.
The attendance is greater than at
any previous gathering of the associa
tion, and the work achieved will prob
ably stand forth as the most import
sat of any that has resulted from a
like convention in this country.
Governor Dockery was to have ex
tended the welcome on behalf of the
state, but was ill and unable to be
present. Mayor James A. Reed took
his place and in an eloquent address
welcomed the delegates; speaking for
the city and state. The response on
behalf of the association was made by
Peter Janson of Nebraska. who spoke
in glowing terms of the work before
the convention and the future import
ance of the National Livestock asso
ciation.
John W. Springer. the president.
then delivered an address. It was
a forceful paper and dealt with legis
lation pending and future necessary
for protection of the livestock asso
ciation industry.
Charles F. Martin of Denver, secre
tary of the associa ion, followed with
his annual report It showed a steady
increase in membership and gave the
scope of the association.
Papers were read by Hon. L. C.
Boyle of Misouri on "Mortgage Law
With Reference to Livestock;" by Dr.
J. Wythycomb of Oregon, on "The
Great Northwest as a Stock Country:"
by W. YV Galbreath of Texas. on "Rail
way Livestock Agents and Their Re
lation to Shippers," and by Thomas
Kelly of Illinois as "The Movement of
