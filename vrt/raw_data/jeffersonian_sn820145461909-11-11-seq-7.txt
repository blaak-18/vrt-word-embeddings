without law, usage, custom or reason,
to these same bills thirty-three and
one-third (or was it fifty) per cent.?
Did the Roman Catholic church have
any of these accounts for collection?
China had to pay, there was no way
to get out of it; we have not got to
pay unless we (by our representa
tives in Congress) want to.
Ts it not also a fact that some ten
or twelve years ago, the Federal gov
ernment refused to allow the Cath
olics to erect and maintain, at their
own expense, a church at West Point
Military Academy? And are we not
taxed, via the tariff, to maintain there
a church of some other denomina
tion 9 . Also is it not a matter of fact
that in the days of the plague-strick
en cities there were always more
Catholic priests and Sisters of Charity
at work, ministering to the suffering;
than there were preachers and sisters
of all other denominations combined?
Another thing I have often no
ticed: I have never heard of a Cath
olic electioneering for a congressional
or legislative or other chaplaincy.
Now do not take me for a papal agent,
for lam not. I have never been in
side a Catholic church, never heard a
Catholic preach, never read a Cathol
ic Bible. 1 am here repeating only
that which I have heard and
read concerning them, and from
this I do not take them to be
any worse than many other churches.
If they are trying to control the
American government, it is no
more than any other church
would be glad to do, and I do not
believe they would give us any worse
government than some of the Protes
tants, for I have found that the
Protestants like to shove things down
a fellow’s goozle that don’t taste
good. lam not trying to bolster up
trie Catholic church either, but I am
merely showing why I think it no
worse, outside its tenets of faith,
than the Protestants. 1 belong to
neither. I am
“Slave to no sect, who takes no pri
vate road,
But looks thro’ nature up to nature’s
God.”
Hence, am not leaning either way,
if I know myself, so far as the Cath
olic or Protestant faith is concerned.
I freely concede that there are bigots
in all, so much so that no Jew or
atheist, though he may have shed
his blood in defense of his country,
could be elected pound-master in a
country village. We are supposed
to tolerate religious liberty, yet we
force the Jew, by law, to close his
door on our Sabbath, though it is
not really his day of worship. We
treat the pagan likewise.
Possibly 1 had better ring off, I’m
taking up too much of a busy man’s
time.
Yours for reform in church and State,
AN ARDENT ADMIRER.

Answer.
(1.) The Catholics have not at
tacked me in the matter of foreign
missions, because they do not work
along the same line as the Protes
tant churches do. Missionaries sent
out from Rome proceed upon the idea
of such conquerers as Napoleon—that
is, the conquered territory must sup
port the invading army. In other
word, the Catholic missionaries live
off of the countries to which
they are sent. No sooner do the
Catholics begin to win converts
among heathen nations, than they
begin to win property also. By play
ing upon the superstitious fears, as
well as the confidence and devotion of
their converts, and by pretending to
have power for remission of sins, the
missionary soon begins to acquire
wealth. Thus, in the Hawaiian Is
lands, in the Philippines, in China, in
Japan, in Hindustan, and everywhere
else that the Catholic church has suc
ceeded in gaining a foothold, they
have accumulated vast amounts of
land and silver and gold and precious
stones. As you remember, they had
absorbed such an extent of Philippine
territory that they had sixty thousand
tenants on their lands, and Mr. Taft
had to pay the Catholic Friars
$7,000,000 in a lump sum to extin
guish their titles.
(2.) It was an ugly scandal about
that Southern Methodist Publishing
House bill and about the falsehood
which was contained in the telegram
that enabled Colonel Stahlman, who
was in charge of the measure, to win
the necessary senatorial votes to get
the money; but the man who sent
that telegram was deposed from his
office by the Methodist Church, and
thus the guilty was punished. I think
there has been no question raised
concerning the meritorious character
of the claim presented against the
Government by the Methodist Church.
The scandal arose over the fact
that such a considerable proportion
of the money had been offered to
Colonel Stahlman to lobby the bill
through. The telegram which stated
that there was no such agreement
was the thing that caused the out
cry.
(3.) As to the Catholic claims for
damages in the Boxer uprising: The
facts are that, through the European
governments, the Catholics did pre
sent and collect an enormous indem
nity, which was far beyond the actual
amount of the property destroyed.
While the accounts of the Protestant
missionaries were scandalously large,
the Roman Catholic church was even
worse in its rapacity and lack of
common honesty.
(4.) It is not a fact that our Gov
ernment refused to allow the Cathol
ics to erect a church on the military
reservation at West Point. On the
other hand, it is a fact that the Cath
olics alone have got a chapel on that
reservation, although both the writ
ten and the unwritten law of this re
public was violated when they were
given that privilege. At this very
time, there are four churches, built
out of public funds, that are con
trolled by the Catholics in the Canal
Zone down at Panama; and there is a
small army of priests and nuns,
down there, who are carried on the
payroll of the Government just as the
laborers are.
(5.) I am unable to say what is
the relative number of Protestant
and Catholic workers ministering to
the sufferers in plague-stricken cities.
In arriving at the numbers furnished
by the Catholics and by the Protest
ants, it would be necessary to ascer
tain how many of the Red Cross peo
ple are Catholics, to say nothing of
the scores of other charitable asso
ciations. We would also have to take
into that calculation the very power
ful factor the Salvation Army. Per
haps no other human agency has done
more unselfish work, in times of ut
termost danger, than this once-de-
TSeffersonian
spised but now uniformly honored
and world-wide institution.
(6.) No, neither have I ever heard
of a Catholic electioneering for a
congressional or legislative or other
chaplaincy, but I see them getting
the chaplaincies, just the same. They
now have more than their share in
the United States Army, and you will
find them getting these offices
throughout the Republic. My dear
friend, you will never see the hand
of a Catholic priest shown in such
matters. They work in the dark, on
the sly, and behind the scenes, but
they get there, just the same.
(7.) As to what the Catholics
would do if they got control of
our Government, it is only fair to
assume that the fruit of the tree
would be the same here as in other
countries. Upon this subject history
speaks with a voice which is not to
be mistaken. Wherever the Cathol
ic hierarchy secures a union of Church
and State and dominates policies of
the nation, that nation is checked, if
not plunged downward. Mexico’s
progress—such as it is—dates from
her breaking the papal chains. The
same is true of South America. Spain
and Portugal are the most backward
nations of Europe. This is due, to
a large extent, to the bigotry of the
priests who have controlled the
Spanish kings. One of the causes
for the terrible conditions that have
so long prevailed in Ireland was the
complete subjection of her people to
the priesthood. The Protestants in
Ireland are those who have dragged
her forw'ard in spite of the priests.
You will remember that Daniel
O'Connell bitterly opposed papal in
terference in Irish politics. His con
stant and defiant declaration was,
“As much religion from Rome as you
please, but no politics.” I am as
much alive as any man to the evils
that exist in our Government, but
where are the plague-spots? My
dear friend, don’t you find them in
such cities as New York, Philadel
phia, Chicago, where the priest and
the saloon-keepers are partners in po
litical crimes? Where do you find
the healthier conditions in American
life? Out in the rural communities,
where the Protestant faith is still a
thing of life.
SENATOR DOLLIVER OF IOWA.
Dear Sir:—l herewith send you
$2.00 to renew my subscription for
the Magazine, also please renew the
weekly Jeffersonian to John Tourson
(above address). Please send me a
knife—if I am entitled to it.
Your editorial, “Dr. Elliott and
Fifty Years Ago,” prompts me to
send you the enclosed clipping con
taining some statements by another
optimist from Easy Street.
Yours is the only magazine that
is read from “kiver to kiver” in our
home. Sincerely yours
ALFRED ’TOURSON.
R. F. D. 5, Northfield, Minnesota,
October 29, 1909.
Answer.
The clipping enclosed purported to
be a report of one of Senator Dol
liver’s speeches.
In this precious speech of his, the
fat Senator was extremely optimistic,
and his view of things was red-rosy.
Yet, Senator Dolliver was present
when the Senate voted to suppress
the official report of the Roosevelt
“Homes Commission”.
Why was that report suppressed?
Because it revealed such awful con
ditions in the city-life of these United
States.
Bearing this fact in mind, it is
difficult to understand how even a
fat, well-paid Senator can talk such
pink-tea nonsense, as Dolliver did.
One thing that Dolliver said is
worth quoting:
“When I first went to Washing
ton from the lowa corn-fields, filled
with ideals, I was humiliated to see
drunken men in the House and Sen
ate; but 1 have seen public drink
ing-places banished, not only from
the capital, but from all public
buildings.”
That statement is not entirely
true. In the magnificent marble pal
ace which our Congressmen have
erected, out of oui - money, for their
own exclusive personal use, it is said
that intoxicating liquors are sold.
But whisky is no longer vended in
the Capitol, directly underneath the
chamber in which our national law
makers sit.
Another man “went to Washing
ton, filled with ideals”; and when he
saw the drunkenness which the Dol
liver and Bryan saw, AND WHICH
THEY MADE NO ROW ABOUT, this
other Congressman (being a rash
fool) raised a mighty racket, con
cerning that Congressional Barroom,
which the Speaker of the House li
censed.
What was the result? Did Dol
liver and Bryan stand by the rash
man who made a fight on drunken
ness in Congress?
No, indeed.
Dolliver was present, in the House,
when I was pilloried and tortured.
Bryan was present, too.
Did either of these gallant “re
formers” come to my rescue? Did
either of them wag their garrulous
tongues in my defense?
Not a bit of it. I trod the wine
press alone. Single-handed, I had to
face the enraged House. I asked no
quarters, and gave none, —thank
God!
But now, when the selling of in
toxicating drinks in the Capitol is a
thing of the past, it does not make
me very happy to read reports of
Dolliver’s Minnesota speech, in
vhich he complacently congratulates
the country on a “reform” which he
b ad no hand in bringing about, and
which, in part, cost me my political
life.
The conforming Dollivers and
Bryans wax fat and rich and popu
lar, while The Rebel chews bitter
memories, bearing, as best he may,
the anathemas of grafters, hypocrites
y’nd shams.
“THE SALOON OR NO SALOON.”
Dear Brother Watson: —I was very
much gratified on reading your edi
torial in The Jeffersonian of the four
teenth. I have had it published in
the daily Ministerial Home, as the
whisky paper of our town published
your editorial in the issue of the sev
enth, claiming you as their friend
and advocate.
It is not the homes they are con
cerned about (they have been wreck
ing them for years), but the opening
of the infernal saloon. Some of our
city fathers have joined hands with
them—hopeful that they may get
the abominable dispensary saddled
on us, so they can finger the pro
ceeds.
There is a great cry over here, that
the preachers have left off preaching
the Gospel and have gone out of the
way to denounce the open saloon and
