OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
It was difficult to pick out the win
ners in the last contest, as there were
so many good letters, but the judges
have finally awarded the prizes.
First prize for girl’s letter on
“Boys,” a gold ring, set with pearls:
Cornelia Wilks, Alexton, La., 14
years old.
First prize for boy’s letter on
“Girls,” a complete baseball outfit:
Albert Mitchell, Pelham, Ga., 12
years old.
OUR NEXT CONTEST.
To the boys we will give another
baseball outfit, or its value in what
ever you may select; and to the girls
we will give a gold ring or pin, as
you may choose, for the two best let
ters on “What I Hope to Be.” Not
more than 70 words allowed. Write
your name, address and age plainly.
Contestants must be under 15 years
of age.
Now, Daddy Jim wants you to be
perfectly frank and outspoken.
Don t tell us what your mother wants
you to be, or what your father says
you ought to be. What we want to
know is your own secret wish—the
desire for the future that lies in your
own heart.
If you, little girl, long, above all
things, to be a happy wife and moth
er, a good cook and a careful house
keeper, tell us so. If you would
rather be a woman’s-rights woman,
with an iron jaw and teusled hair,
getting your picture “took” and your
speeches printed, don’t hesitate to
say so. If diamonds and weaalth,
fine clothes and idle luxury, appeal
to you, write it down. No matter
what you want to be—wife, mother,
cook, artist, singer, actress, mission
ary, female politician—make no
bones about it; come right out and
tell us.
And you boys, tell the truth.
Would you like to be a great hunter,
with dogs and guns and fine horses,
and the scars that wild animals use
for keepsakes? Would you rather
be a fine preacher? Or a politician?
Or a hunter of men—a detective?
Who will you be—a writer of things
that men and women shall laugh or
weep over? A millionaire, whom
some shall bow before, and some
shall curse? A plain farmer, per
haps, healthy and content? What-
ever it is that seems to you most
desirable in life, write it down plain
ly, thougntfully and truthfully, as a
prophecy.
GIRLS ARE COSTLY, TOO.
I think the girls are too expensive.
They chew fifty cents worth of gum
a month, and their rats co&t a dollar,
and when you go to their rooms
you’ll find fine dresses on the floor,
dust all over everything, and gum
stuck on the walls.—Edward Boyd,
13 years old, Tarrytown, Ga.
ADVOCATES BOYS’ RIGHTS.
Some people think boys are made
only to be useful. They can work in
the garden in the pouring rain, but
if they want to go fishing, they hear
on all,sides: “No, no! You will
catch your death of cold.” I would
like to know if they won’t catch cold
Olje Jeffersonian
in the garden? If 1 were a man, I
would be an advocate of “boys’
rights.” I am a little girl, 9 years
old. —Iva Sloan, Hartsfield, Ga.
DID AS HE WAS TOLD.
Some time ago I wrote a letter to
the Weekly Jeffersonian and told
you I would try to send you some
subscribers. You told me not to say
“try,” but to say “I will,” and here
I am. Please find postoffice money
order for SI.OO. Let this subscrip
tion commence with the April num
ber. Send me a knife, please, sir.—
T. Watson Sims, Orchard Hill, Ga.
IF THERE WERE NO BOYS.
Most boys are fine, while others
are not what they should be. I have
two brothers that I think are pretty
fine little boys. Boys are very use
ful. If it were not for boys, we
would not have any presidents or
governors. I guess we would not
have any wars, either. I like good
boys.—May Johnson, aged 10, Grif
ton, N. C.
WHAT A WINDER BOY THINKS.
I think girls are very sweet. A
nice, intelligent girl is better than
most boys that go off Christmas, get
drunk and have fights, while the
girls are at home cooking and sew
ing for them. I think a bad girl is
as bad as some boys. The Scripture
says: “Tell the truth wherever you
go.”—B. L. House, aged 12, Winder,
Ga.
FROM A TEXAS BOY.
Some girls like to sweep floors and
wash dishes, and some girls like to
ride horses and play ball. Some
girls are pretty, and some like pretty
dresses. Some girls have plenty of
hair, and some are ugly. Some girls
like to talk, and some are bashful.
Some girls play with dishes and
dolls, and some like to work.—Tom
House, aged 11, Rotan, Texas.
All our friends who send us sub
scriptions, whether agents or not,
will greatly help us by looking after
the renewals of those subscriptions
at the time of expiration.
A JEFFERSONIAN PISTOL.
I am a farmer’s girl, and like farm
life fine. Papa takes a good many
papers, weekly, monthly, and some
twice and three times a week, and
he likes the Jeffersonian best of all.
He carries it in his pocket and reads
it to his friends. I call it his pistol.
Please send me two dozen magazines
for June.—Verna Simmons, R. F. D.
5, Albertville, Ala.
SOME MORE ABOUT BOYS.
lam a little girl 14 years old. My
father takes the Jeffersonian, and I
like to read the letters very much.
I think boys should be very temper
ate and drink nothing stronger than
water, and should not smoke ciga
rettes, nor use profane language, and
always be kind to their parents.—
Johnnie Barker, Quitman, Ga. (You
will see that Daddy Jim has made a
few corrections in spelling.)
