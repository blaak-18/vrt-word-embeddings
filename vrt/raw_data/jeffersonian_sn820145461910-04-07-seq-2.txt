Does the Protective Tariff Protedt Citizens of
America Who Sell Their Labor?
There are today in the United
States a great many men who must
sell their labor in order to get the
necessities that they and their fami
lies require. They are compelled to
hire out their services and get a job
in order to get the money they know
that they so badly need.
A great many of the men of this
country who depend on the skill of
their hands or the strength of their
arms are at a loss to understand why
it is so difficult to get a job, and they
do not know why they must accept
such low wages when they are given
a job.
These men know that they are liv
ing in a country that is more fertile
than any other land on earth.
They know that the crops are al
ways bountiful and that food is pro
duced in such abundance that nearly
all of the armies and navies of the
world now draw upon this country
for the supplies they need to keep
their soldiers and sailors healthy and
stout and strong. Men who are na
tives of the United States and men
w r ho are naturalized citizens of the
United States know that they voted
for the men who were pledged to
strengthen the present protective
policy of the government of the Uni
ted States. These citizens have seen
the men they voted for elected to of
fice and their party placed in com
plete control of the law-making pow
er and yet they shake their heads and
wonder, and they can not understand.
These citizens have done as they
were bidden and they know their
party has enacted the protective laws
they promised, and yet when they
call upon the owner of some highly
protected industry and ask for a job
they learn that some native of Syria
dT RwgSU or Hungary, who is not a
citizen of iTe'’-c fitted otatfis,.. js al
ready on the pay-roll. They learn
with sorrow that the owner of the
protected industry seems to bear
them no gratitude for their loyalty
to the policy that has made him rich
and powerful.
They also learn that the native of
Russia or Syria or Hungary is pre
ferred by the owner of the protected
industry to the citizen of America
when jobs re given. Some of these
citizens of the United States at last
commence to inquire the reason why
the owners of the protected indus
tries prefer to give jobs to the aliens
of Europe or Asia, and they are
grieved and shocked to find out that
it is because these manufacturers can
hire the aliens for wages that are
low'er than an American workingman
would require to feed his family de
cently.
The American workman also as
certains that the owners of American
manufacturing plants appreciate very
much the cringing servility of the
alien, and they greatly dislike what
they call the haughty independence
of the citizen of the United States.
To such citizens of America as be
lieve in the protective theory, but
who are now out of a job or who are
holding jobs at wages far below the
value of their services, I will ask that
they consider the following in con
nection with a tariff tax for the pro
tection of American labor:
No man ever went before a Con
gressional committee and asked that
a tariff tax be placed on a certain ar
ticle he wished to manufacture in or
der that he might thereby be aided
by the government to get very rich.
Every man who has asked for a tariff
tax on articles he intended to manu
facture has always made the plea to
Congress that he only gave himself
incidental consideration and that his
purpose was to give employment to
American citizens at good wages, and
to transform unskilled laborers into
mechanics of skill and ability.
Every applicant for a tariff tax has
always seemed to effervesce with an
intense love for his American fellow
man and he always gave many assur-
ances that he was really unselfish and
truly altruistic in his purpose.
Every man who has gone before
the voters of the country to justify a
tariff tax has always done so on the
ground that this tax excluded the
products of foreign manufacturers
and therefore secured to home manu
facturers the United States market
and the glorious opportunity to give
employment to idle Americans at
wages that would be so much higher
than are paid to European working
men, that the men of America would
be thereby enabled to raise their
families in accordance with the ex
alted American standard.
No man ever went before the
voters of America and asked them to
put a tax on foreign goods in order
that a home manufacturer might
build a great factory and then fill his
factory with natives of Europe or
Asia or Africa.
To make an argument of that kind
would be political idiocy and political
suicide. It is, on the contrary, the
purpose of all tariff advocates to im
press upon the American voter the
idea that when he excludes from the
country the man who sells goods he
also excludes the man who sells la
bor.
The tariff advocate has defended
his cause with such skill that a great
majority of the workingmen who in
dorse this policy at the polls really
do so with the idea firmly intrenched
in their minds that a vote to exclude
goods will also exclude the men who
make goods.
This is the very point at which the
workingman is deluded, and it has
been proven many times, especially
in the greatly protected State of
Pennsylvania, where some of the
owners of the most highly protected
industries have caused advertise
ments tO b? printed in the newspa
pers stating that they needed men,
but that Syrians, Slavonians anu
Hungarians were preferred.
The tariff tax, therefore, is lop
sided, one-sided and jug-handled,
and the men who are getting fabu
lously rich by its aid have no more
love or affection for the American
voter than they have for a man in
Mars.
When the present injustice is
pointed out to the beneficiary of the
tariff he hastens to explain that the
contract labor law is the one strong
plan by which the American voter
who has labor only to sell is pro
tected, but he does not deny that if a
thousand men were to land in Ameri
ca on a certain day they might call
on the owner of a protected industry
the next day and sell to this owner
their labor for 50 per cent, less than
such owner may have paid the day
before for labor sold to him by
American citizens. The contract la
bor law is a joke for the owners of
protected American industries who
buy labor and a tragedy to the Amer
ican citizen who has labor only to
sell.
The American laborman is not pro
tected by the contract labor law nor
by the present tariff law. In order
to give to the American workingman
the protection that the tariff is sup
posed to insure, the tariff ought to
go both ways.
The workingman can now buy
sjoods in any part of the world, but
when the foreign article reaches
American shores the government
fines him 50 or 75 or 100 per cent,
of its value for his disloyalty to the
owner of the American industry
which produces the same article.
Therefore, abolish the contract la
bor law. Permit the owners of pro
tected industries to buy labor in any
part of the world, but impose upon
them the very conditions that the
government now imposes on the men
who sell labor.
Provide that the owner of a pro
tected industry shall pay a tax equal
to the tariff tax on the goods he pro-
Jeffersonian
duces, on every dollar he pays for
labor sold to him by persons who are
not citizens of America, either by na
tivity or naturalization.
To illustrate: If the owner of a
protected industry is protected by a
duty of fifty per cent., he should be
compelled to pay 50 per cent, on
every dollar he may pay for labor
sold to him by a person who is not a
citizen of the United States, either
by nativity or naturalization.
If the tariff worked both ways the
owners of highly protected industries
would have no agents scouring Eu
rope for cheap labor, and all persons
who came into the country would
have to be here five years and re
nounce foreign allegiance before they
could get an untaxed job in a pro
tected industry.
American youth would then have a
chance to learn trades that they now
have very few opportunities to ac
quire. A law of this kind would
leave the unprotected vocations only
open to foreign labor, and therefore
many foreign-born men would become
citizens who now are not citizens of
the United States.
A native of England is employed
in a protected industry in Chicago
at a salary of $4.50 per day. The
owner of this industry is protected
by a duty of 50 per cent. The Eng
lish native has been in the United
States twenty-three years, and when
asked why he is not a citizen will al
ways explain that he considers the
government of England better than
that of the United States, and that
under no circumstances will he re
nounce allegiance to England and
swear fealty to the United States.
If the tariff went both ways this
native ,of England would now be
working as an unskilled laborer in
an unprotected vocation, or he might
have been a citizen of the United
States for eighteen years.
Th order to do justice to the work
ingmen of the United States every
advocate of protection who has any
sense of fair play and square dealing
should do his utmost to help enact a
law that will make the tariff work
two ways and give to the American
who sells his labor the same protec
tion that is now given to the Ameri
can who buys labor.
It is well to remember that when
this argument is presented to the po
litical grafter he will nearly fall off
his feet in his haste to emphasize its
unconstitutional features. But it
should not be forgotten that while
the Constitution has often been in
voked in order that a big thief may
be permitted to rob great multitudes,
it has always been beyond the pale
of the little thief who may have
stolen a door mat or a chicken. Chief
Justice Taney of the United States
Supreme Court claimed that accord
ing to the constitution Dred Scott
had no rights that a white man was

bound to respect, but his interpreta
tion was changed after the people
spoke, and now a horse or a dog has
rights that men must respect.
That the tariff should go both
ways is absolutely fair and just and
all men who enlist in the propaga
tion of this cause should never per
mit themselves to be swerved by
those public officials who may admit
the justice of the theory, but profess
such reverence and respect for the
Constitution that they could not un
der any circumstances lend their aid
to a measure that nine corporation
lawyers may see fit to condemn.
The voters of this country should
remember that their judges have
never been selected on account of
their zeal in behalf of the disinherit
ed and the unfortunate, but they
have been selected on account of
their loyalty to the interests of those
men who grind dollars out of human
flesh, bribe law-makers and endow li
braries and great institutions of
learning. JOHN W. MASKELL.
