JUST JOG ALONG.
Just jog along, today is short,
And you may die tomorrow,
So keep you moving while you may,
And do not stop for sorrow;
And you must smile if you would
win,
As well as work and battle —
The wagon always wears the best,
That has a cheerful rattle.
A pout does not become your lips,
And do not wear a frown;
They will not help you to a place,
Nor bring to you renown;
But smiles will often pave the way,
Where you would like to go—
A homely face is beautiful,
With cheerfulness aglow.
Remember, too, that cheerfulness
Will always bring you health,
And that a winsome smiling face,
May pave the way to wealth;
But know you this, a surface smile,
A smile that plays a part,
Can never win; the smile that wins
Comes straightway from the heart.
Then let your soul shine through
your eyes,
And mix in with your smile,
And have your heart to show itself,
Within your face the while;
And jog along in cheerfulness,
Avoiding thoughts of sorrow;
Just leave it for your friends to feel,
When you must die—tomorrow.
—JAKE H. HARRISON.
THE CONDITION OF WOMEN IN
TURKEY.
As you read of the recent trouble
some times in Turkey, do you think
only of our endangered missionaries
and the native men, or do you some
times ifleditate over the condition of
the native women?
The latter are not only in trouble
at present, but have been throughout
their existence. Their position is
very much contrasted to that of their
sex of enlightened countries, and
they, in turn, are not to be compared
with the free, liberty-loving and
beautiful American women in any re
spect.
They are not educated like our
women, neither do they receive kind
treatment, and therefore they have a
weird expression, which, taken with
their broad faces, wide and flattened
nose, small obliquely set eyes,
coarse straight black hair, and their
olive yellow complexion would make
quite a contrast to our American
women.
Yet not only in personality are
they below the women of our coun
try, but they are also far below them
in their religious ideas. The greater
portion of these women are Moham
medans, and the sum and substance
of what the great mass of them know
about religion and Heaven is, that
the first consists in obedience to
their husbands, no matter how vile
they may be, and the second is only
to be secured by them as a reward
of such obedience.
The class of women that worship
do their worshiping at home; or, if,
at times, admitted to the mosques, it
must be when the men are not there,
since anything like a recognition of
woman’s equality before God would
be regarded as in the highest degree
subversive of true social order and
piety.
The treatment they receive at the
hands of their so-called husbands or
superior sex is most brutal. When
these men speak of their wives, they
call them “their house,” and they
have numerous proverbs expressive
of the very low estimate they put
upon woman. Here are a few of
them:
“Obedience to women will have to
be repented of”; “The heart of a
woman is given to folly”; “Women
are the whips of Satan”; “Alas for
the people who are ruled by a wo
man”, etcetera.
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
The mother weeps with her female
friends when a girl is born; and well
she may, for most keenly can she ap
preciate the life-long disappointment
and suffering which await the inno
cent babe.
These degraded Turkish women
are very superstitious and they feai’
the “evil eye” above all things.
They wear amulets and charms to
break its power, and they put
branches of a thorny plant across
their chimneys in the form of a cross
to prevent witches from coming
down and strangling the little chil
dren.
Os course such things are done by
the ignorant, for where we find su
perstition, we always find a certain
degree of ignorance.
I say “done by the ignorant,” for
all of the women in Turkey are not
of the same class. Some are being
educated.
Formerly the Turkish woman was
ashamed to confess that she knew
how to read, but now she blushes if
she has to confess that she cannot
read.
They are also being elevated in
many other ways, and this elevation
has brought about a great change in
the family life.
Many Turkish men have received
education in the great European uni
versities and have gone home with
broad ideas as to the gentler sex,
who are rapidly profiting by enlarged
opportunities for education. The
“New Turks” have no better allies
than the enlightened Turkish wo
men. NELLIE BURT.
THE LOVE THAT LASTS.
By Elbert Hubbard.
In the springtime of his manhood,
Auguste Comte, sensitive, confiding,
generous, loved a beautiful girl. She
did not share his intellectual ambi
tions, his divine aspiration: she was
only a beautiful animal.
Man proposes but he is not always
accepted.
She married another and Comte
was disconsolate —for a day.
He pondered the subject, read the
lives of various great men, talked
with cowled monks and sundry friars
gray, and after five years wrote out
at length the reasons why a man in
order to accomplish a far-reaching
and splendid work must live the life
of a celibate.
“To achieve,” said Comte, “you
must be married to your work.”
Comte lived for some time con
tent in his philosophy, constantly
strengthening it and buttressing it
against attack; for we believe a
thing first and skirmish for our proof
afterward.
But when past forty, and his hair
turning to silver and crow’s-feet
were showing themselves in his fine
face, and when there was a halt in
his step and his laughter had died
away into a weary smile, Comte met
a woman whose nature was so finely
sensitive and as silkenly strong as
his own.
She had intellect, aspiration, pow
er. She was gentle, and a womanly
woman, withal. His best mood was
matched by hers; she sympathized
with his highest ideal.
They loved, and they married.
The crow’s-feet disappeared from
Comte’s face, the halt in his step was
gone, the laugh returned, and people
said that the silver in his hair was
becoming.
Shortly after, Comte set himself to
work overhauling all of the foolish
things he had said about the neces
sity of celibacy. He declared that a
man without his mate only stumbled
his way through life. There was the
male man and the female man, and
only by working together could these
two souls hope to progress. It re
quires two to generate thought.
Comte felt sure that he was writing
the final word. He avowed that
there was no more to say. He de
clared that should his wife go hence
'Seffersonian
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
the fountain of his soul would dry
up, his mind would famish, and the
light of his life would go out in
darkness.
The gods were envious of such a
love as this.
Comte’s mate passed away.
He was stricken dumb; the calam
ity was too great for speech or tears.
But five years after, he got down
his books and went over his manu
scripts for the third time. He re
vised his philosophy of what consti
tutes the true condition for the high
est and purest thought.
To have known a great and exalted
love and have it fade from your grasp
and flee as a shadow, living only in
memory, is the highest good, he
wrote.
A great sorrow at one stroke pur
chases a redemption from all petty
troubles; it sinks all trivial annoy
ances into nothingness and grants
the man lifelong freedom from all
petty, corroding cares. His feelings
have been sounded to their depths—
the plummet has touched bottom.
Fate has done her worst; she has
brought him face to face with the
Supreme Calamity, and thereafter
there is nothing can inspire terror.
The memory of a great love can
never die from out the heart. It af
fords ballast ’gainst all the storms
that blow. And although it lends an
unutterable sadness, it imparts an un
speakable peace.
A great love, even when fully pos
sessed, affords no complete gratifica
tion. There is an essence in it all
that eludes all ownership. Its high
est use seems to be a purifying im
pulse for nobler endeavor. It says
at least, “Arise, and get thee hence,
for this is not thy rest.”
Where there is this haunting mem
ory of a great love lost there is al
ways forgiveness, charity, and a sym
pathy that makes the man brother
to all who endure and suffer. The
individual himself is nothing; he has
nothing to hope for, nothing to gain,
nothing to win, nothing to lose; for
the first time and the last he has a
selfishness that is wide as the world
and wherein there 4s no room for the
recollection of a wrong.
In this memory of a great love
there is a nourishing source of
strength by which the possessor lives
and works; he is in communication
with elemental conditions.
Harriet Martineau was a lifelong
widow of the heart. That first great
passion of her early womanhood, the
love that was lost, remained with her
all the days of her life, springing
fresh every morning, her last
thought as she closed her eyes at
night. Other loves came to her, at
tachments varying in nature and de
gree, but in this supreme love all was
fused and absorbed.
In this love you get the secret of
power.
A great love is a pain, yet it is a
benison and a benediction. If we
carry any possession from this world
to another it is the memory of a
great love. For even in the last
hour, when the coldness of death
shall creep into the stiffening limbs,
and the brain shall be stunned and
the thoughts stifled, there shall come
to the tongue a name —a name pos
sibly not mentioned aloud for years
—there shall come a name; and as
the last flickering rays of life flare
up and go out on earth forever, the
tongue will speak this name that was
long, long ago burned into the soul
by the passion of a love that fadeth
not away.—N. Y. American.
HOUSE A WOMAN BUILT.
Miss Lilie M. Johnson, of North
Eighteenth street, Kansas City, Kan.,
built the nine-room house in which
she now lives. Miss Johnson began
work on her house in the fall, fol
lowing the big flood in the Kaw Val
ley of 1903. She was a Salvation
Army worker in Armourdale at the
time of the flood. She lost every-
thing except $7. She went to a real
estate firm and arranged to buy on
payments the 100 feet of ground on
which her house stands.
In May, 1904, Miss Johnson built
a two-room house, doing all the work
herself and getting the lumber on
payments. She received two women
boarders and by July she was able to
buy a cow. She began taking in
washing. Through these various
means she was able to meet the nec
essary payments on her lot.
But Miss Johnson was not satis
fied. She desired to enlarge her
house. She graded her lot with a
spade and wheelbarrow, laid the
foundation, put up the frames, boxed
and weatherboarded the addition.
She has finished the entire interior of
the house, laying the floors, lathing,
plastering and papering the walls.
The grounds about the place are
well kept. A large grape arbor, fruit
trees, and flower beds, with the blue
grass lawn make the place attractive.
“How did I learn to do carpenter
work? Why, I just found I could do
it when I built my two-room box
house, and I determined to try my
hand at something better,” Miss
Johnson said. “I believe no passerby
would know that a woman built it.”

EVE UP TO DATE.
Plumes are only rivaled by flowers
and fruit, a la mode hat trimmings.
Jet chains are among the season’s
novelties with lockets of the same.
A trellis work of beads is used as
a trimming on some of the chic
frocks.
Although white is always popular,
this summer will be noted as a sea
son of color.
Colored linen waists to match the
cloth skirt are seen frequently on
smartly gowned women.
Ivory tips are seen on the newest
parasols and it is rather effective
with the pompadour patterns.
Net will not only be used this
summer for yokes and sleeves, but
frocks are fashioned out of it in the
prettiest styles.
Nothing is more popular than the
old-fashioned foulard for this spring,
and the patterns come in multitu
dinous variety.
Lace flschus will undoubtedly be
very popular before the summer is
spent, as the Paris ateliers are show
ing them on many frocks.
Embroidered linen turnovers and
Dutch collars of Irish crochet are al
most a uniform with fashionable peo
ple this season.—Birmingham Age-
Herald.
The princess gown of last year is
strictly “in it,” so to speak, again
this season, and with the addition of
long sleeves and a Dutch neck it is
quite a la mode.
You know that the most of the
hats that men wear these days are
made of cotton. Just cut a lamp-wick
off of an old, worn-out cotton hat and
use it in place of a net wick and you
will find that it burns just as good
and makes as fine a light as the net
wick, with the additional advantage
that the cotton wick will not smoke
the globe. If you would like to test
this, put an old hat wick in one lamp
and a net wick in one, light them
both and hold a piece of white paper
over the globes of each one, about
two inches off, for twenty-five or
thirty seconds and note the result.
