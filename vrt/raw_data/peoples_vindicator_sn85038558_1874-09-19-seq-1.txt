Is our Government a Failure ?
[From the Naevillo UIion and Anmericahl
The Cincinnati Gazette, one of the
ablest Republican journals in the
country, tells its readers in plaii
terms, that "No people in the world
have so little respect for their gov
ernments as the people of the United
States." Is not this a fact of much
portent? Either the government, as
conducted since 1861, when it was
declared to be the best in the world,
has been debased by insane, and pos
sibly incurable changes of the Federal
constitution, or Ihe people themselves
are mad not to respect their self-gov
ernment. The Gazette has too much
sen0se not to see the mistake its party
has committed by "conferring the
governing power on near a million of
men of a race degraded in their na
tive country, and here by ages of
slavery."' But in what way does the
party which controls both Houses of
Congress and the Administration aim
to correct its obvious, and generally
acknowledged errors I The Gazette
thus answers the question:
"Our politicians said they would
know enough to vote for their own
friends. Here was the party gain
that is always uppermost in these
strokes of State. They said, also,
they were as calable of voting as
a large class of the foreigners we had
made voters. This was true enough,
and it shows how one step degrada
tion furnishes the level for another.
No one thinks it worth while to stop
at anything. In fact, no one thinks
we have anything in the Government
worth preserving, save the chances
of aparty in it. At the last session.
the House passed ai bill to erect New
Mexico into a State, with a voice in
the Senate, to neut'alize that of Ohio.
Yet it has not 10,0O(H English speak
lug inhabitants, and is a mixture of
Mexicans, Indians and negroes, with
scarcely any of the conditions of civ
ilization. The House said the same
with the wild Territory of Colorado.
These are the doings of a people who
have lost all respect for their govern
ment. It is much worse in local gov
ernment, for there the scalawag, the
bummer, the adventurer, whose trade
is to degrade, is preferred for public
trusts to the best citizens. Govern
mient in America is a thing of public
contempt."
If "GovernmIent in America is a
thing of public contempt," there is
an adequate cause for it, which
every voter should ponder and under
stand. It is false, if not calumnious,
to affirm that "nearly a million vo
ters" of the African race are as ca
pable of voting as the European race,
whether the latter have come to this
country within five years or are de
scendants of immigrants who came
before the revolution. This radical
idea of negro equality is alike false
and degrading. It is incapable of ad
ding either wit or wisdom to the ne
gro elector, legidSator, judge, juror or
governor, while it is all-powerful to
bring the white man's abridged and
divided right of republican govern
ment into incurable contempt. Negro
equality means amalgamation and the
downfall of the government, to be
followed by alternate anarchy and
despotism. There must be more pu
rity and higher intelligence in legis
lation, more truth and profound re
gard for right, less sham and counter
feit patriotism, before our political
system can recover the public esteem.
Even negroes will not respect a hy
brid government.
"The Thieves Own."
The New Orleans Republican is of
late much given to throwing tihe
boomerang, which, mimsing its mark,
returns and cuts off its own head.
We some weeks since stated that a
most estimable lady of DeSoto parish,
who in early life was a resident of the
New England village in which Kel
ioggs's youthful career began, inform.
ed us that he was so incorrigible a
little liar and rascal that the citizens
compelled him to leave and "go
West."
We subsequently stated that a
friend who had boon sojourning at
the Hot Springs in Arkansas, there
met two gentlemen from Illinois, both
of whom were republicans, who said
they had known Kellogg for thirty
years and that he was recognized as
one of "the greatest liars and thieves
in the State of Illinois."
The Republican attempts the sar
castic in reply to the latter charge
we did not notice at the time whether
it made any reply to the morals of
men who visit the Hot Springs might
be questioned, and adding something
about our having friends in the peni
tentiary.
It is possible that the Thieves Own
forgets that the gret apostle of its
party, the aoge c, immaculate and
truth-telling Morton, spent several
months at the Hot Springs the past
summer ?
As to our having friends in the pe
nitentiary we are not prepared posi
tively to say. Nor some wise and in
smrtable purpoee the Deity permits
the editor of the Republican and kind
red thieves to hold a high carnival of
mcrime on the outside, while a good
man might, for some equally inscru
table purpose, be forced to wear his
life dnt within the wealls. We say
? this might be the case-we do not
l,,sitive.y affirm it. There is one
tlhing, however, that we do aiflirnl
e without fear of contradiction, and it
e is this: There are now in the Louis
iana penitentiary seven hundred men
I -who are less guilty of crimes against
humanity avld the best interests of
1 the people of Louisiana, who, in short,
II are better men, than the Republican
s editor.
s This stricture may not be very ar
tistically or wittily applied, but its
overwhelming truth covers up and
is an apology for all defects of style
and breach of good taste. In band
ling such vermin one cannot lie as
dainty as he could wish.-SISreveport

~ elloegg's Supertisors,
f The sincerity of Kellogg's promise
u to give the people of the State and
f city a fair election is demonstrated by
I his recent appointments of supervi
V sors. Four-fifths of those selected
o for this parish are oflice-holders,
either under the Federal, State or
I city administration. When these
I men know that upon this registration
1 depends their future chances for of
r flee, what can be expected of them I
Will they act fairly and impartially ?
s Will they discharge their duties as
: honest offtticials, and do full justice to
º all parties ?
Those who are familiar with the
* character of Republican officials in
P this State, know well that they will
s stop at nothing short of the accom
t plishmneut of their purposes, however
8 infamous and nefarious they may be.
" They will throw every impedinient
in the way of the registration of the
n white people, and will fi audulently
issue to the negroes as many certifi
cates as may be required to attain
their object. They have done this
I before, and they will do it again, un
less prevented by the people in a
13 manner that will strike terror to their
very hearts, if they have any.
It is well known that only through
the grossest fraud and illegal conduct
can the Republicans of this State hope
3 to succeed in the next election.
a Finding their inability to cope with
C the white people fairly, it is their
- intention to commit such barefaced
C and inexcusable wrongs as will bring
about violence and perhaps bloodshed,
i with Ia view of thus securing the
s presence of 'Federal troops. These
i obtained and, they imagine an easy
- victory to be within their reach.
Let these hopeful office-holders not
- deceive themselves, however, in this
- way. As we have said before, the
people are determined to have a fair
s election or no election at all. If,
- therefore, there be any attempt made
3 to deprive honest voters of the right
I of registration and of voting, there
Swill be such steps taken as will bring
- about the substitution of a military
- government for the bastard concern
r that now pretends to exercise authori
ty over Louisiana.
I No one expected for a moment that
- Kellogg would appoint any one as
) supervisor save the most pliant, sub
B servient and unscrupulous of his un
derlings. Decent men would scorn to
I do the dirty work he requires of
- them, and hence lie is driven to ee
lect from the purlieus and dregs of
- society and the lowest haunts of the
ignorant and debased negroes for
1 creatures to do his bidding.
. uch are tile men who hold in their
- hands the political destiny of a great
State like Louisiana! Willthen,
thie intelligent and civilized world be
surprised at or condemn the determi
nation of the white people to rid them
selves of such a loathsome and kil
f ling oppression Are we to be cen
B tured for maintaining our liberty,
asserting our manhood, and purify
ing our conntry of a fool element thait
Sbreathes destruction on all that is
goodandfair ?
If so, then better abandon Louis
-lana to the fetish rites of the vondo
-and give the negro and the alligator
undisputed sway !-N.. O. B.lletin.

Pufitanism and Civil Rights.
From the Na~ 1hilhk Union and A.mnrican.
The New York Tribune finds thei
recent elections in Kentucky and
Tennessee "not pleasant to read
about." Indeed, it rather sees "a
better prospect for the South in the
spectacle of Packard and l'inchback
quarreling over the spoils of Louisi
ana, than Knoxville going wild with
joy over the success of the white
muan's ticket." It says no political
issue materially influenced the con
test. The staple arguments were the
dreadful old Bourbon conandruils.
"Do you wish to be buried in a nig
ger graveyard I Do you wish your
daughter to marry a negro? Are you
going to send your boy to a nigger
school T" If these questions were
forced home on the Tribune dilet
tanti by the presence of a large ne
gro population and a pending Civil
Rights bill, perhaps they would not
object to be buried in negro grave
yards and to send their daughters as
well as sons to negro schools.
The Tribune is peculiar; the Trib
unle is Puritai4 The Beecher-Tilton
agony of now four years' duration,
and known all through to scores of'
"respectable" men, with fItmilies, de
velops a condition of society that we
do not understand, nor care to iu
derstand. The Tribune and other
Puritans may be sincere in their ad
vocacy of the Civil Rights bill. It
may be, that, in our place, they would
logically prefer to be buried in negro
graveyards and send their daughters
to negro schoolmasters. We do not
gainsay their sincerity. We simply
do-not understand them, and are cer
tain that they do not understand us.
The best course then is to let each of
us regulate our own affairs according
to our tastes. We have never sought
to interfere with the domestic and so
cial relations of the Puritans. We
decidedly demur to their effort to inm
pose their own peculiar notions on
us through Congressional centralism.
There is a dead fly in the ointment of
the Tribune's Liberalism so long as
it supports a Radical Congress in this
despotism over interests held by us
more sacred and dearer titan life it
self
But Civil Rights are only one form
of this Puritanism against which the I
masses North and West as well as
South are arraying themselves. We
have the same Tribune and the same
Puritans to fight against the tariff
enormities, against manufacturing
and banking monopolies, against rail
road exactions, against Credit Mobi
lier corruptions, and against central
ism in all its threatening forms. Civil
Rights and social levelism are but
the latest fruit of the Puritan tree.
We must cut down that Upas growth,
and throw it out of the National gar
den, root and branch. It may flour
ish as it will in its native soil, undis
turbed, until Boston or Brooklyn be
comes a second Salt Lake, for all we
care personally, but it cannot be per
mitted to blight the whole nation.
CONFIDENCE.--There is nothing like
confidence in either friendship or
love. If people will have secrets, and
will enjoy the privilege of shutting
others out of their inmost hearts,
they must make up their minds to
forego all that tenderness which can
only come through a thorough knowl
edge of each other. We must, at
least, believe that we read the very
soul of man o5 woman, or there is a
barrier between us, too large for love
to climb. True, with most people it
i best to be only on terms of court
ely. But we all need something bet
ter than this; we crave sympathy
and appreciation; and we cannot win
these by formal smiles and society
politeness-by keeping our true selves
shut away from sight, and presenting,
instead, a well dressed dummy with
out feelings or opinions. It ms easy
to love a person who frankly owns to
something of which we disapprove,
or who thinks we do not, on malny
subjects. But it is impossible to be
tender to one who regards us with
such suspicion that hlie will not allow
us to guess his motives or his inten
tioane, his hopes or his fears, his joys
du his sorrows: who will never, under
any circumstances, reveal hlimself.
When we know nothing of any one,
we are ready to believe anything we
hear. If we hear nothing, we grow
suspicious. We have no right to ex
pect confidence of the multitude, but
the individuals who are nearest to us
wrong us if they do not show it, and,
in my opinion, very bitterly.

soli.ervation and probably a little
htlilosophy of things, if written for
tho benefit of others, would be about
as follows: During the hot suomner
muobths I should feed very little solid
feed, such as corn in the ear or un
cracked. I would keep hogs upon
green feed constantly, either grass,
oats or rye, and feed them at regular
iitervals, once or twice per day, upon
1iN.died feed, either shorts, choped

trodghs. When fed in this way, and
at the same time allowed access to
waterand shade hogs will bear crowd
ing through the hot months, a very
gooe time, if not the best, to take on

condition for corn feeding, which
should commence about the Ist of

How TO COOK A BEEFtr K.--Ma
ny who are reputed to be good cooks
have but little idea of the only true
way to cook a beefsteak. That wo
:ay derive botlh pleasure and nutri
luent·, judicious management on the
part of the cook is essential. Se
lect a fat and tender sirloin; pound
it well and place on a griddle over a
bed of hard-wood coals; sprinkle a
little salt on it and allow it to broil
until the juice is seen on the upper
side; then lift from the griddle so
that the juice may be saved on the
platter and turn it on the griddle
again, for a moment only, then place
on the platter, and lay on it a few
thin slices of sweet butter. Serve
immediately with butter, toast or
fried potatoes. If the steak is cook
ed hard and dry all the best qualities
of it are lost; and one might as well
feed upon chips. Five or six minutes
is sufficient time to cook a steak, and
the hotter the coals the better; un
less cooked quickly with great heit it
will be tough and unpalatable.
SUCAn CAKE.-- pound of lbutter,
* pound of sugar, 1 pound of flour, 3
eggs, and milk enough for a dough.
Beat the butter and sugar together;
whisk the eggs light and add them,
stir in the milk and flour alternately
so as to form a dough. 1Ill the
dough out, cut in cakes and bake in a
moderate oven.
8Sow BAL.-s.-Beat the whites of
10 eggs till very dry, then add very
gradually 1 pound of pulverized su
gar, and 2 or 3 drops of tihe essence
of lemon. Have ready some white
paper and with a spoon drop the
mixture in balls upon the paper. Set
thenm in a moderate oven and when
tinged with brown take them out.
FIN, ASD COARSs HAY.-Produ
cers are sometimes puzzled to know
why city buyers generally askfor
coarse, well-matured hay in prefer
ence to the more tender and in reality
more nutritious kinds. The Live
Stock Journal thus enlightens them:
"City muen feed hay for a different
purpose than the farmer. The far
mer feeds it for its nutriment and as
a principal food, while the city man
regards grain as the cheapest food,
and only gives sufficient hay to make
bulk in the stomach and for the pur
pose of health. Coarse, well-maturedl
timothy serves the purpose better
than the early-cat and tine grasses.
They do not desire such hay as will
teugpt the horses to eat 1too much of
it. Btraw would answer this purpose if
cut and mixed with the grain about as
well. But farmers should be content
with this practice of the city castomer,
for it enables them to sell their poor
est hay for the best price, and to re
tain the best quality for home con
sumption."
