RECALLS LINCOLN’S WORDS ON PRED
ATORY CORPORATIONS.
(Continued From Page Three.)
Soon after Mr. Lincoln said: “Yec, we
may all congratulate ourselves that the cruel
war is nearing a close. It has cost a vast
amount of treasure and blood. The best blood
of the flower of American youth has been
freely offered upon our country’s altar that
the nation might live. It has, indeed, been a
trying hour for the republic, but I see in the
near future a crisis arriving that unnerves
me? and causes me to tremble for the safety
of my country. As a result of the war, cor
porations have been enthroned, an era of cor
ruption in high places will follow and the
money power of the country will endeavor to
prolong its reign by working upon the preju
dices of the people until all wealth is aggre
gated in a few hands and the republic de
stroyed. I feel at this moment more anxiety
for the safety of my country than ever be
fore, even in the midst of war. God grant
that my suspicions may prove groundless.”
And we trust that God will give President
Roosevelt the courage and patriotism to veto
the Aldrich money scheme, should the bill pass
both houses of Congress.

WANTING FOR MANY YEARS
/’"COLORED Pictures of all varieties of Poultry, Turkeys, Ducks and Geese will appear in the ■
( American Poultry Journal beginning with the February number. You can get these ■
by subscribing for American Poultry Journal, 50c a year, or still better, if you tell your ■
friends about these pictures and get two or more subscribers, we will make each one of you the ■
■ cut price of 35c a year. * You probably already know the merits of American Poultry Journal, as
it is known everywhere, being the oldest poultry paper in the United States and having the larg- ■
est circulation, 60,000 monthly. We spare no expense to make American Poultry Journal the ■
■ best. sFor two years we have been preparing this magnificent work, and it has cost us nearly ■
■ $5,000.00. Never before in the history of the poultry business have all recognized varieties of ■
poultry, turkeys, ducks and geese been pictured in colors and assembled in one harmonious ■
I series of illustrations. Poultrymen have wanted und demanded these for years, but no other
Poultry Journal has dared to undertake it; not even the American Poultry Association, although
I the demand from poultrymen for colored pictures is so strong tbat it is now talked that the
I American Poultry Association will have colored pictures of fowls in the Standard some time in
■ the future. ISend in your subscription today and start with the February number, so that you
■ will secure the complete set of these beautiful colored pictures. Address all orders to
