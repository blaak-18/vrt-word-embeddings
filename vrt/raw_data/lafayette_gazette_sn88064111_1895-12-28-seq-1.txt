SENTIMENT IN CEMETERIES.
Some Curious Poetic Effusions Found
Graven on Tombstones.
Here are some epitaphs brought back
to town by a summner tourist. The first
three were found in Clarksville, N. Y.
Henry Gay had three wives--So
phronia, Enmeline and Jane. Sophronia,
died November 5, 1830. Her epitaph
reads:
Don't mourn for me: the die Is cast.
Our life is like a fading rose.
Prepare for death and follow me,
And in your Saviour take repose.
Emteline died November 30, 1832,
Upon her tonlbstone was this verse:
Submissive to a stern decree
I come. Sophronia, after thee:
To mingle dust and join thy spirit,
In that blest world that saints inherit.
May Henry and our progeny
I Join us in blest eternity.
Jane joined the others on September
17, 1846:
The bonds of earth are severed:
Thou art numbered with the blest;
Where the wicked cease from troubling
And the weary are at rest.
another epitaph at Plymouth reads
briefly:
To father, t
Parted below.
: To mother,
Joined above. t
Two children have this unfeeling
story cut in marble above them:
Here lies two babes.
As dead as nits,
What shook to death
With ague fits.

THE WIVES OF CAPE COD.
many of Them sa5led Around the World
Several- Times.
Cape Cod is the home of the pioneer
yachtswomen of thiscountry. The so- be
ciety woman who has flade a trip Il
around the world in her husband's
yacht is looked upon as a very much
traveled personage, but there are cap- is
tains' wives who have made one or
more voyages to Japan and China, and A
have been able to discuss the Chinese
and Japanese war with easy famillari- sc
ty. Many of them are widows now
who lost their husbands by shipwreck
on a trip when the captain, with, it
would seem, almoat a foreknowledge n
of coming events, had refused the a:
wife's plea to sail again with him. In EL
the palmy days of Cape Cod shipping a
every captain took his wife on at least
one voyage, most of them on long P
trips lasting a year or more. The cap
tain's wife often became the good angel '
of the fo'cas'le. a
She dosed the crew when they were h
ill, wrote letters home for them,looked ti
after their morals, and on Christmas P
saw they all had some gift. Others P
lived in an aristocratic way and never
interested themselves in the affairs of v
the crew, never went into the- gallery L
to arouse the ire of the cook. Such o
women had a piano aboard, with a li- ti
brary and household pets, and devoted 1
their time to fancy work. a
When their sailing days were over '
the wives came ashore to their native
villages and settled down to lead what t]
to outsiders seems a tame existence. E
In almost every village from Province- a
town to Fairhaven there is some old c
captain's wife who has no one of her a
own to look after. She mothers the s
whole village. Everybody sends for o
her first on all occasions of joy and
woe, of life and death. F
When she is approached rightly, and a
the mood moves her, she delights the a
younger generation with tales of ship- a
wreck and storm, of adventures in t.
China, Japan, India and many strange t
countries barely known even now to
the civilized world. But, best of all,
are the stories that are illustrated by t
some old silk gown or piece of antique 1
jewelry, a fan or handkerchief or
shawl from India, such as Queen Vic- f
toria has made famous as bridal gifts.
At the summer home of Capt. and
Mrs. George Lunt, at Chatham, is an
illustration that never fails to satisfy.
It is Pop. In winter Pop lives with t
his mistress and Capt. Lunt in East
Boston. In summer he comes to Chat
ham, where his dogship passes a high
ly respected existence, pampered and
lacking nothing that so dignified a dog
can desire. Pop is a hero among the
rest of the dogs in Chatham, because
he has not only been a great traveler,
but has had thrilling escapes from
danger by sea.
Capt. Lunt has been a famous Cape
Cod captain, and Pop's mistress sailed
for years, as many as twelve, with her
husband wherever the ship went. She
is a very handsome, white-haired
woman, very attractive and refined.
She sailed around the world five times
in her husband's ship, and made sev
eral voyages to China.
For the last five years of her sailing
Mrs. Lunt made her home on board the
ship United States. She has had all
the refinements of a home about her,
and always had several pets aboard..
It was over ten years ago that the cap
tain of the ship signed in Liverpool for
a cargo of Lancashire coal, which was
to go around Cape Horn and
neross the Pacific ocean to China.
One of the mysterious somethings
with which Cape Cod men and women
are so familiar, yet never attempt to
explain, impelled the captain not to
sign for his wife.. The captain's wife
didn't like it, but she always believed
her husband knew best how to run his
ship. S: the United States sailed
away, carrying the captain's wife's
piano and all her. dainty belongings in
its cabin. Then there were her pets,
consisting of a favorite cat, a canary
bird and a dog. But the captain's wife
sailed for New York by steamer, came
to Cape Cod, and about the fiftieth day
went to Boston to engage a sleeping
car section for her trip across the con
tinent t: San Francisco, where she
was to meet the ship. In the street
she read a bulletin board: "Ship
United States burned at sea, and all
on board lost."-Philadelphia Item.
TOO MANY BEADS.
She Bald Sewed on a Million and Yet Com
plailned of Hecr Eyes.
A little black-eyed seamstress ap
peared the other day in the office of a
well-known oculist complaining of her
eyes. "They are strong enough," said
she, "'but they hurt me."
"You have been focussing them,"
said he, looking critically into their
depths, "upon some minute object for
many hours at a stretch. There is
coming a small furrow between your
brows, and your eyes have a weak spot
in the nerves at about sewing fonus.
Do you use the needle much?"
"I don't know," hesitated she,
"whether you would call it much. I
sewed jet beads upon thirty yards of
white ribbon in wheel pattern, making
a hand-made trimming; then I cut out
the edges of the ribbon down to the
beads, and button-holed both edges of
the ribbon, keeping the inn and out of
Sthe pattern, and then I fitted the bead
ed ribbon into a pattern of jet beads
upon the back of a bodice. There
were, I guess, a million beads, and I
don't know how many button-hole
Sstitches. There wasn't one stitch as
big as a machine stitch."
5 "Ah," said the oculist, "I under

SCHOOL AND OHURCH.
-The oldest United States college is
Harvard, founded in 1036.
-It is said that of the 50,000 Indians
belonging to the Sioux tribe 4,000 be
long to the lOpiscopul, Presbyterian
and Congregational churches.
-Tenago Sehyoun, of Benda, Egypt,
is at the Cincinnati law school to study
American and English jurisprudence.
He is a graduate of Alexandria law
school, and is the first Egyptian to
pursue his law studies in the United
States.
-In the early days of Christianity
many styles of dating were in vogue,
and eras were established with the
annunciation, the birth, the transfig
uration, the ascension and other events
in the history of Christ as starting
points.
-At a recent religious meeting in
Boston Mr. Elijah A. Morse skid that
although he was a Congregationalist
he "would advocate the Episeopal cus
tom of introducing a petition for the
president and public officials in all our
prayers."
-Classical scholars all over the
world are at work on a "Thesaurus
Linguae Latinue," under the direction
of the German Philological associ- 9
tion. The work will cost s150,000.
The first parts- will be issued in 1900,
edited by Professors Bnchcler, Leo and
Wolfflin.
-It is a common fallacy to state
that the pilgrims introduced into the
Holy Father's presence kneel down
and kiss his toe. The real facts of the
case are that the pilgrims kiss a cross
embroidered on the toe of one of the
shoes which his holiness wears on this
occasion.
-The Bambino di Ara Coeli. of
Rome, is the oldest doll in the world,
and, if tradition is true, almost as old
as the Christian religion; for it is
claimed to have been carved out of a
tree from the Mount of Olives in the
time of the Apostles, and to have been
painted by St. Luke.
-According to.an article in the Oc
tober number of the Century on "The
Marriage Rate of College Women.'
based on carefully-gathered statistics
from all of the women's colleges of the
country, the ultimate probability of a
college woman's marriage is below
fifty-five per cent. against ninety per
cent. for other women-not quite two
thirds as great.
-A Congregation in Kansas seems
to have found a new way of raising
funds for .their church work. They
have agreed to sow one hundred and
sixty acres of -land with wheat, and,
after deducting a certain sum for rent,
devote the rest to paying church ex
penses. The members furnish teams,
plows, laborers and seed, and expect to
be able to provide preaching for every
Sabbath from the proceeds.
-The Holy Alliance of 1511 was
formed by the pope, Julius II., with
Spain, Venice and Switzerland against
Louis XII., who had managed to steal
for himself all the benefits of the
League of Cambria, and had appro
priated the territory of Venice. The
specific purpose of this league was to
Irive the French out of Venice and
take from their control all their pos
sessions in the Italian peninsula. Its
objects were not carried out on account
of the death of Julius, which occurred
- a short time after the formation of the
alliance.
BAD FORTUNE.
An Engllshman Cast Upon a Lonely Island
and He Died In Squalor.
"Some years ago, up at North Haven
° island, on the Maine coast," saida a New
° Yorker recently, "I came across a mys
tery that haunts me still. A bare,
1 rocky point juts out into the sea on
one side of the island, and the first
year that I visited the place there was
a rude cabin on the rock. Having gone
out there from curiosity one day, I
found a man in shameful rags trying
i out oil from the refuse- from a fish-can
ning factory. When I came to exam
ine the man his appearance astonished
m"He was an extremely handsome,
well-made Englishman of forty or
thereabouts. His hands, soiled with
't the material he worked in, were small
p and well shaped. When I tried to
L draw him into conversation he at first
answered me in monosyllables, and
was almost sulky in his reserve. He
gradually thawed, however, and I
found that he spoke rare and beauti
ful English-that of a well-read and
well-bred man. Glancing into the door
- of his cabin. I could see perhaps a score
a of well-thumbed volumes in library
r binding. His reserve was such that I
d could not ask him about himself, but I
left the island deeply interested in him.
S "I turned up at North Haven the
r next year, and one of the earliest
r things 1 did was to go' out to the point
s in search of my acquaintance. The
r rock was bare again and there was no
t trace of him and his cottage. I asked
. about him of some persons I met on
the island, and here is what I learned.
He had come to the place mysteriously
I some years before, having been drop
,f ped by a schooner.
g "He found work at the fish cannery,
t brt later quit the place, built his
e cabin on the rock, supplied himself
-Iwith food chiefly by fishing and ob
f tained from the factory the privilege
- of trying oil from the refuse. From
Is the product he obtained a little ready
a money for tobacco and other luxuries.
I At some time between my two visits
e his cabin was discovered to be on fire
a late one night, and, hurrying down,
his neighbors saw him amid the flames
dead, with his throat cut. The fire
a had so seized upon the hut that his
a body could not be removed until it was
a nearly consumed. He was buried and
a no solution of the mystery was discov.
ered. Life had evidently beeom. in
supportable to him nnd he had takesn
the way of suicide as the easiest one
out of misery."-~N. Y. Sun.
