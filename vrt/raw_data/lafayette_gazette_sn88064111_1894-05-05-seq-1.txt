Swas simply one
of the army of
supers who
came out in
tinsel and tin armor to march and pose
and form an effective background for
the principals wilho won the applause of
the uatience night after night. Still
he knew he could act. lie felt it in his
soul, and he would prove it to the
whole world some day. lie was born
with a silver spoon in his mouth, and
it made little difference if the governor
had cast him off when he left college
to go on the stage, for he knew his
luck would conme back to him in time.
He was always thinking of her. He
saw her fresh oval face in the blue-gray
rings of his cigarette smoke: the smell
of roses was like the perfume of her
breath; her eyes looked at him from
the pansies on every corner flower
stand. Perhaps this was because she
was one of the band of wood nymphs
who canme out in pink and white to
strew flowers for the feet of the prima
donna to crush. She should have been
a prima donna herself:; he had heard
her sing, and lie knew. Wait till his
fortune came back to him.
They were both stopping at the same
wretched actors' boarding-house, on a
side street that ran from Broadway to
the Blowery, and at dinner she sat op
posite him at the long table around
which gathered nightly a rare collec
tion of chorus girls, ballet dancers,
song and dance artists, variety per
formers, and broken-down and hard-up
people of the "legit." lie knew that
curly shock of yellow hair was not its
natural color, and her eyelids were
penciled, but she had teeth like ivory
and her laugh thrilled him away down
into his shoes. It was only when the
professional ventriloquist, desiring the
butter, made the chandelier squeak,
"'Shove the grease, Coots," that he be
came aware he was staring at her and
not eating a mouthful. lie hated the
ventriloquist; for that manipulator of
vocalization was the one who had
given him the nickname of "Coots,"
and now everybody in the house called
him that-even she called him that.
Blut she was divine!
The "Johnnies" gathered thickly
about the stage door every night to see
the chorus girls come out; but he knew
she hated the insipid fops, for he had
heard her say so, and she never paid
any attention to them. She usually got
off first, and left the theater as soon as
possible, and he had not yet commanded
sufficient courage to tell her lie would
take her safely to the boarding house
if she would wait. But one night she
was delayed, and he was close behind
her when she left the theater.
There was the usual throng outside
the stage door, and one of them spoke
to her. He had been drinking, and he
placed himself in her path, offering his
arm and proposing to call a cab. She
&ND COOTS WAS WALKING AWAY WITH
HER.
tried to pass him, but he caught at her
arm. The next instant he lay fiat on
his back, and Coots was walking away
with her.
"Oh, I thank you, Coots!" she said,
with a catchy little laugh that was like
the gurgle of a brook to him. "That
cad has bothered me for a.week. Per
haps he'll keep away now he h-a got
swiped." a
He did not mind the slang; he ex
pected it. He had found everybody
talked slang at the boarding house, and
it sounded rather sweet and "chic'"
from her lips, when he would have
thought it coarse from some other
woman.
"I'm almost ashamed to think I
struck him so hard." he said; "but my
blood boiled .vhen I saw him put his
haud on your arma, M~I Torle"om
"Oh! call me Daisy. Coots; that's
good enough for nmy style."
"Your style! You're too modest.
You are fit to star. You will someday,
too."
"Well, I hope you're right. All I
want is to get .hold of an angel I'll
work the ducl for all he is worth!
Twelve dollars a week is rocky, but I
have to do it or get off the earth."
"Wait till my luck comes back to
me!" cried Coots. "I'll back you then.
I'll have a piece written for you."
"You dear boy!" she laughed.
They did not talke a car. She said
she had as lief walk, as it would save
the fare; and Coots was sure he had
much rather wallk as long as she was
at his side.
"Tell me, Coots-how did you ever
happen to get down to this?" she
asked.
Then he told her all about it. and she
called him a foolish fellow, but he did
not agree with her.
"Mother sends me money every now
and then, without the governor know
ing it," he said. "I'll get along all
right until I find an opening and do
something to give me a foothold."
Coots never forgot that walk down
Broadway and the warm pressure given
his fingers by her plump little hand
when they reached the boarding-house.
That night she was in all his dreams.
Sidney Temple belonged to the
"legit," but he was in hard luck; the
"Ifowery Flower" company, in which
he had played the heavy villain, having
stranded in Oshkosh, where they were
-serted by their manager and left to
get back to New f'ork as best they
could. Temple had come in on his
pers, and he was staying at the second
rate actors' boarding house until he
struck another engagement. How he
obtained money to pay his board was
something of a mystery, but it was no
ticed that he had become very friendly
with Coots, the two being together-a
great deal. Daisy was the first to sus
pect the truth, and, one day, she ac
cused Temple.
"You are playing Coots for a sucker,
Temple!" she declared, her brown eyes
flashing. "1 know he has money from
his mother, and you are beating him
out of it at cards! You are encourag
ing him to drink, too."
Temple laughed. "Well, what of it,
Little Spitfire? He'll blow himself
TEM PLE
some way and I've got to live till I get
on the road again."
"It's a shame!" cried Daisy, warmly.
"You are a scoundrel and he is nothing
but a boy!"
"It seems to inc you take a remark
able interest in the kid. I believe
you're stuck on his bang."
"I don't care what you believe. I'm
not going to see him beaten out of his
money."
"llow will you help it?"
"I know a way. There's a nman on
Twenty-third street who would give
something to know where to find yon,
and hle says he is willing to pay your
board at Ludlow street jail for awhile.
If you don't let up on Coots, that man
is pretty sure to find you."
"I pass!" said Temple, ruefully.
"You hold high cards and the pot is
yours."
One day Coots came to Daisy with a
strange look of mingled grief and joy
on his face.
"It's awful'" lie said, chokingly.
"Father's dead. Terribly sudden.
Ileart failure."
lie saw the sympathy in her eyes,
and he went on, before she could
speak:
"lIe was rich, you know, and his will
leaves one-half of everything to me,
providing I give up the idea of going
on the stage."
"Of course you will do that,", she
said. "Yon',i be crazy if you didn't.!"
"Yes, I shall give it up. I don't know
as I was cut out for an actor, after all.
I told you my luck would come back to
me, and I would not forget ydu then.
There is nothing in the .1'ill to prevent
me from marrying an actress and back
ing her, if I want to do it. If you'll
marry me, Daisy, I'll put you out in a
new piece and at the head of a first-class
company."
"You dear, good boy!" she cried, with
a laugh that was half a sob. "I
signed contracts for next season yes
terday, and I am to marry Sidney
Temple next Saturday! We are going
out together in the same company."
Coots' luck had truly come back to
him!

"No, sir-never dispute. If a man

as he wants to."

depot to see about trains and I met a
mnan with yaller eyes. Ever see a man
with yaller eves, same as a cat's?"
"I don't think I ever did."
"Nor I, ether. Struck me as rather
curious. I spoke to a feller about it,
and he said it also struck hinm as rather
curious. A feller with cat's eyesought
to be able to see in the dark hadn't
lie?"
"I should think so."
"So should I. I spoke to another fel
ler about it, and he said he should
think so, too. IL you could see in tihe
dark you wouldn't get mad about it,
would you?"
"Of course not."
"Neither would I. I spoke to an
other feller about it, and he said lie
wouldn't, either. If you'd bin there
would you have asked the yaller-eyed
man if he could see in the dark?"
"Why, yes, I thiuk so."
"Thank you. I thought I was the
only fool in Nichigan, and it consoles
me to find a partner. I put the ques
tion to him, and the depot and a wheat
elevator and a warehouse all hit me in
the eye at once, and w'en I recovered
consciousness yaller eyes had departed
on the train. Better make that ten
pounds, for I canu feel my whole head
swelling and I'll beef it clear down to

A ROMANTIC MARRIAGE.
Hle Offered the Beat Security lie Had-
JIlliiselt-and r he Accepted.
"Talk about romantic marriages,"
ejaculated a well-posted rounder the
other morning. "There goes a couple
up Fifteenth street who came together
in the most remarkable way you ever
heard of, and who are enjoying a great
deal of happiness, too. D)oa't mention
any names and I'll tell you the story.
Some time ago the man, who was in the
real estate business, advertised for a
sumn of money, repaymer t of which
would be guaranteed by nuquestiona
le security. The advertisement met
the eye of a young and buxom widow,
who had several thousand dollars
which she wanted to invest, and she
answered it in person. TWhen
she visited the advertiser's office
shle was doubtless favorably im
pressed with his appearance and
had an opportunity to study him per
haps, because there were several call
ers before her. At last lie was disen
gaged, and stating her mission the
widow inquired what security would
be given for the loan.
" 'Mladame,' said the agent, 'I am a.
man of ups and downs in the world;
now successful and then unfortunate.
Sometimes I am on my way to the exec
utive mansion and at others my path
leads in the direction of the work
house. Blut such as I am I offer my
self as security for the loan I have ad
vertised for. Marriage, madame, mar
riage, is the security I offer you."
"Naturally, the widow was flustrated
and shortly withdrew, stammering
out, with violent blushing, that she
would consider the proposition. That
her consideration must have been fa
vorable goes without saying, because
they were married in Iess than two
weeks afterward, and they are just is
happy, to all appearances, as if their
courtship had been two years longi."-

Cursing, it may be observed, con
tinued in full vigor in Christian times,
often harmonizing ill with our modern
notions of Christianity. Some are al
most horrible in their ferocity, as when
the violator of the tomb is told that
"lie will be accursed of God forever',"
or that "lie will give account to (God,
Who will judge the quick and
the dead." There is one which
perhaps will rather provoke a
smile. The offenderis threatened with
the curse of all the fatlhers of the
Nicene council. "Hle that thlrows rub

runs, "has tke anathema from the
three hundred and eighteen fathers, as
an enemy of God." Sidney Smith once
alluded to a forty-parson power (of
preaching, if we remember aright),
but the anathematizing ability of
three hundred and eighteen Nicene
fathers is a much more appalling idea,
and there is a ludicrous contrast be
tween this terrible but vague penalty
and the very prosaic and familiar of

HINTS FOR MOTHENS.
How to Mlake Children's Gowns Inezpen.
sively, Yet In Good Taste.
The combination of simplicity and
good taste is in general a pretty safe
rule for children's gowns, but for girls
between twelve and sixteen the dresses
have become such ambitious little
copies of those worn by their mothers
that much of the desired simplicity is
lost, particularly if the material em.
ployed is silk or wool. A pretty model
is of soft wool fabric, which in color is
an indtescribable blending of pink al
blue. The quaint little collar, which
is the special feature of the dress, is
made up of pink bengaline and
trimmed with a frill of lace. The
small yoke and lower part of the
sleeves are of the same lace. The back
is like the front, except that the collar
is open where the waist fastens. The
skirt is plain and full, with two -little
crimped folds of silk at the bottom.
iert-has of every shape and descrip
tion, both double and single, are used
on dresses for young girls. Double
berthas, edged with lace or embroidery,
are especially pretty for ginghams and
mnuslins, and make a nice finish for
guimlpe waists.
Another simple gown is made of wool
in pale pink, flecked with green. The
waist is pf green bengaline, and over
this a piece of the material is folded tc
form a jacket, back and front alike. A
bertha of green silk cut wide and full
over the sleeves, and tapering toward
thle back and front, where it meets,
tinishes the jacket at the top. A belt
and sash of bengaline complete the
trimming. The sleeves are of the reg
ulnation leg-of-mutton shape, finished
at the wrist with silk cuffs. Crepons,
china silks and challies are popular
materials for young girls' wear. The
chlallies are particularly pretty this
ytear, with a little dot of silk in them
to brighten the effect of theoowering,
and they are, always serviceable, be
cause they wash almost like ootton
cloth. Cashmeres are fashionable again
for very young children.-N. Y. Sun.
- Gowns of Black Braild.
Among the many novelties of the sea
son are entire gowns of black braid
made over colored silk. The whole
skirt is formed of bayadere stripes of
braid about an inch wide joined by
open herring-bone stitches of black
silk. through which is seen a colored
taffeta petticoat, one of the prettiest
showing pale Parma-violet silk. A
round waist of violet brocade is cov
credb3y a bolero of the black braid in a
fanciful open design of leavesand flow
-rs joined by the silk stitches. Large
mutton-leg sleeves of black satin are
quite plain. A stock of white ltce with

DIET FOR THE SICK.
It Ought to Be a (ooed Deal the Same as
the Person Taked When Well.
In old times it was customary when
one became ill to prescribe a diet of
toast, broth, gruel and the like, and
keep the sufferer on the shortest kind
of short rations even of this kind of
food. No matter how long the illness
continued this regime was kept up.
Exhausting and depleting medicines
were given, and every effort seemed to
be made to reduce the strength and
vitality of the patient. To be sure,
many people get well in spite of this
treatment, but it must be said that it
was more through good luck than good
management. When the constitutions
were robust enough to triumph over
so many adverse conditions, there was
a more or less complete recovery: but
delicate and susceptible temperaments
usually succumbed to this formidable
array of adversaries.
Modern medical common sense dic
tates that people shall not be starved.
at least, whatever other treatment
may be necessary. A sufficient amount
of nourishing food is therefore given,
and this food is quite likely to be the
same that the person is in the habit of
taking during health, barring, of
course, all extremely !indigestible
dishes or those that will conflict with
the remediesgiven. As a g epral thing,
a sick person requires vei. much less
food than a well one, although this is
not always the case. People of seden
tary habits, those who take little or no
exercise to exhaust the physical forces,
might need almost as much food when
sick as when well. -
There are few follies more extreme
than that of putting sick people on a
diet of toast-water and thin gruel. It
would make a well person sick, and
how one can be expected to recover
health and strength on such pabulum
is more than ordinary intel
ligence can conceive. A small quan
tity of good meats, the vegetables that
are most craved, a little light bread,
the best of butter and the usual bev
erages should be given if they are at
all relished. It is one of the greatest
of mistakes to give sick people sloppy
drinks of any sort. If it is necessary
to quench the thirst, an abundance of
pure. water, boiled and cooled to the
temperature of spring-water, is most
desirable. Coffee, tea anti chocolate
are better when used of regular
strength such as is taken during health.
The quantity may be a good deal les
sened, but the quality should remnuhi
the same. If people in ordinarily good
condition get a cup of tea and coffee,
such as invalids are supposed to re
quire, it would be almost certain to
upset the digestion. How much more
need is there then of care when all of
the functions of the body are more or
less dera n .ed?
It is frequently the case that a hit
of broiled chicken, steak or bird with
a little dry toast and a cup of good
coffee will relish and be satisfying
when nothing in the way of invalid's
food, as ordinarily given, can be toler
ated. Of course. the food should be
eaten very slowly indeed and thorough
ly masticated. If th'e condition of the
patient will permit, some extremely
entertaining conversation may be car
ried on during the meal. It is a well
established fact that amusement dur
ing eating, especially that provocative
of laughter, is of the greatest possible
benefit. Indeed, the laughter cure,
administered in a quiet way and with
out too much nervous agitation, has
been of the most marked advantage in
many instances. Several physicians
make it a point to amuse and enter
tain their patients quite as much as to
prescribe drugs and diagnose the cases.

its long waits at the depot, the cat will
go in search of fun or mice, and at
some of the most used junctions it is
quite a local pet. While the engine is
running the cat sits in the cab or on
the coal, and as its fur is jet black, its
beauty is not greatly impaired by its
peculiar surroundings. I ussy must
have traveled many thousand miles,
for it has been doing duty for several
years and has never been known to
miss a trip. The first journey or two
there was much difficulty about keep
ing the animal from jumiping off, but
there is none now, norl does its owner
bother himself about ascertaining
whether his feline passenger is aboard
or not. The absolute indifference of
cats to persons and their attachment
to places and environment is seen in
this instance, for when last year the
engineer got injured in a wmreck and
was laid up for three months, the cat
stayed around the shops until the en
gine was repaired and then resumed
her rides with the substitute engineer.

AIR MACHINES IN WARFARE.
-ow lBalloons May Be Managled Dlarla
Operations in the Field.
Balloon and wagon have formed*a
junction and are ready to start with
the troops. Away goes the wagon, with
the balloon hanging to its tail, while
the attendant sappers oaeach side keep
it steady. The train moves along at a
good round pace, easily keeping up
with or even passing the infantry, and
makes for the particular spot at which
it has been determined to commence
ballooning operations, which is usually
on the top of a good, high hill. As
ascent is an easy enough matter, and
is soon accomplished. The balloon it
securely fixed to the end of the wire
rope, and the two men who are tc
ascend take their places. At the
word of command the men who have
been holding down the .r
and up shoots the balloer: wtnding
the rope as it rises, and allowed some
times to ascend toa height of one thou
sand feet. And suppose the officer re
ceives instructions to move the positios
of the balloon, is it necessary to haUft
it. down? Not a bit of it. A man is
placed at the end of the wagon whc
carefully guides the connecting rope
so that it can not get entangled or run
risk of being cut. and away goes the
wagon, sometimes at a trot, across
fields, and up and down hill, until the
balloon itself is a long distance from
its original station. Next, suppose
that it is necessary to lower the bal.
loon, is it needful to wind in all the
wire rope that has been paid out from
the reels? No such thing. The bal
loon is brought to earth in a much
more expeditious manner. A long,
stout pole, in the middle of which is a
pulley wheel, is laid across the rope
lHalf a dozen men seize the pole
and run it along the rope and
their weight soon brings the balloon
down to the ground. Passengers
can then be carried on, and then the
men run the pole back, and up shoots
the balloon again many hundreds of
"feet into the air, without having been
away from its exalted position more
than a few minutes. But it is not
necessary to lower the balloon in this
or any other way whenever it is re
quired that messages should be ex
changed between those below and those
above. There are various contrivances
for doing this. Sometimes, for in.
st;lnce, a wire in attached, througb
which messages can be sent to a tele.
phone. Another plan is to send mes.
sages down the wire cable. A little
wire hook is fastened around the cabl;
and the letter or cable, weighed down
with a small sandbag, is sent fluttering
down. The human voice, it may also
be added, can be heard both from a
considerable height and depth, so that
verbal communication is not difficult ii
there is no wind.-N. Y. Times.
CARE OF PIANOS.
When the Selnsitlve Instrumente Get Out of
Sorts.
"Sometimes a piano gets sick," said
an expert tuner yesterday. "This Bluf
falo weather seems to give them the
grip. Pianos, you know, have feelings
same as anybody. Didn't you know
that? Well. they have. This piano I
have just doctored was not so much
out of tune as it was sick; run down.
It had caught cold from changes of
temperature. There has keen a sort
of epidemic lately and ever. so many
pianos have had to take treatment.
There are two other complaints com
mon with pianos. One is lack of exer
cise and the other is overwork."
"About how much exercise should a
piano get?"
"In most cases from one to two hours
a day, to keep it in the best of health.
.More than two hours a day slowly saps
a piano of its vital energy. Another
thing about a piano is that it has to
breathe. This fashion of smothering a
piano in clothes-I mean draperies
and such things hanging dlown their
backs-isn't any better for it than to
jam it close up against a wall. A
piano should stand two or three inches
out from a wall. so that it can get
plenty of air. How can a piano be ex
pected- to be reasonable, I'd like to
know, if it isn't treated like one of the
family; and if it isn't attended to when
it complains?"
'"Vhy isn't piano-tuning just the bus
ness for women," this music physicirn
was asked.
"W\Vell," he replied thoughtfully. "so
far as the hours and physical labor
are concerned, the business is just the
thing for women, but, although they
have the ear, somehow they don't
catch the science of it or the spiritOittt.- -
"They don't seem to get into sympa
thy with a piano. I suppose it may
be a good deal like the difference in
doctors. Some of 'em understand you
and you think you are going to get
well, while others who have just as
rood pills can't help you a bit."-Buf

Knives and Forks.
As regards table furniture, forks we
know were not in general use until the
seventeenth century, though as early
as the thirteenth we find instances of
gold and silver ones being kept for
special purposes. Six silver forks and
one of gold occur among the list of the
valuables of Edward I. John Duke, of
Brittany, iS mentioned as using one to
pick up "soppys," and Piers Gaveston
had three for eating pears with. The
custom, however, was considered an
effeminate one, and for the general ac
commodation of guests nothing but
trenchers, napkins, and spoons were
supplied; knives-a broad knife and a
narrow one-were indeed 'laid by the
pantler on the high table along with
the bread and salt, but these were for
the use of the attendants only in cut
ting and removing pieces of bread. For
cutting up" their own meat the guests
had recourse to those they themselves
wore, and the carver carried his, whioh
were of a particultar pattern, in &
ase. A very handsome set of carver's -
knives, with handles of ivory and sal
rer, may be seen in the British museum.
