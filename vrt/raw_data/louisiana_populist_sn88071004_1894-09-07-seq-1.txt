1. We demand a national cur

public and private, and that with
out the use of lºanking corpora
tions; a just, equitable and etiicient
means of distributiona direct to the
people, at a tax not exceedinlg 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub-treasury plan of the Flarm
ers" Alliance, or some better system
also by payments in discharge of
its obligations for public imnprove
meuts.
a. VWe demand iree and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at the

c. We demand a graduated in

ed.
e. We demand that postal sav
ings banks be established by the
government for the safe deposit of
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
$. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
est of the people.
a. The telegraph andl telephore,
like the post office systen,-being a
ne.essity for the transportation of
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the gov*rnaent in the in
teest of thb people.
3. The land, including all the
national reaourteq,of wealth, is the
heritage of all the people, and
should not be monopoliled for spec

sbip of lad shoauld be pobhibited.
. llad u, bo ld by railroads and

They are all aroulend and aboe still

tiou loon. up in every busites, s en
terprise we undertake. Iu other
words, if we had more money in
circulation we would all be better
clothed, making a market and de
anand for more cotton goods. The
cottone mills would start up to osup
haply the increased demandir for cloth,
idle workingmen would be employ
ed to suply the demand for labor.
these trorkigmen would have em
ployment at wages that would, in
turn enable them to clothe them
selves, mand fatiles, and make still
another demand for cotton goods,
and all other branches of industry
would revive, the steamboats, ocean
steamers, and the railroads would
have to increase their wailities in
order to meet the demand for in
creased transportraton, thereby em
ploying another cast army of idle
people, who in their turn would be
able to clothe themselves and fami
lies, making still further demands
for cotton goods; merchants would
have to increase their sdemandlesr oen;t
farmers and ouplanters wotheld im
prove their farms, giving employ
meDt to another class of labor, and
they all in their turn would ab
sorb a considerable percentage of
cotton goods, and this would of
coarse increase the demand for cot
ton, and wouhl increase the price.
Do not think Captain that we
are endorsing, the theory of over
production, for we are not. But
we do hold and contend that it is
unn<er consumption that brings up
this heterogeneous family of the
"Devil and Tom Walker" for pay
ment, when there is nothing to pajy
witll.
Now Captain, peruse your letter
to the "Caucasian" (given above)
and see if you don't flnd.a little in
consistency in your remedy. You
say that "90 per cent of the cotton
planters are wrapped up in mort
gages," (which Is about oorrect)
then you tell these sane planlters
not to sell their cotton unless they
get ten cents a pound for it. Now
doi't you 'know that a man in debt
is at the nmercy of his creditor, and
that wheh ipay day comes his c6t

This party is also in favor of the

with an issue of United States
treasury notes in a sufficient
amount to increaso the circulating
lediuml to .ot) per capita, and all
money to be full legal tender for

tual plractical experience has taught
us that this will give tus relief and

do it. Now it you will aid us to

your place will be kept up; your

you can replaco them with young

be clothed and at school ; you can
pay your doctors, lawyers and
preachers; you can furnish better

be supplied; your wife have the
latest fashion, and you can have
your papers, in fact, prosperity will
reign and the "Devil, Tom Walk

don't tell us this is politics, and
therefore you are not "in it," the
best of lexicographers tell us, that
politics are "the science of govern
ment," and therefore if we get re
lief, we will get it iu and through
political actiou. Don't hang on to
the old tariffkite of the Democrat
ic party any longer. We have had
good and bad times with bothl low
and high tariff. The conduct of
the Democratic party during this ad
mninitrationi is sufficient to convince
anyman thajt there isnothingin the
tariff. We know that if there had
have been anything in the tariff by
which relief and prosperity could
have bee-, brought to the people,
the Democratic party would have
brought It out, more especially so
when it would have perpetuated
the Democratie party in lower in

no relief given by this Congress is

The Alabama Sltuations.
There is no doubt an alarming
state of affairs in Alabama and to
say that :the condition is critical
would be expressing the case very
mildly.'
The people are excited and it is
not surprising that such is the
case.
The evidence of fraud in the
election of the 6th :inst. is conclu
sive.
It is not a matter of conjecture
nor supposition, :It is a postively
established fact.
This being the case the only sur
prise is that the excitement is no
greater.
The registration law has given
the friends of honesty and ai fair
count some advantages, for in the
past there was not the same op
portunity for easily making mani
test the operations in what is
known as the black belt.
There has been and are yet,
enough whnites to manipulate the
returns and send up any required
number of votes to ensure the elec
tions of the machine ticke, but
under the new law the negroes,
rather than be counted contrary to
the way they vote refused to regis
ter at all, hence the majority re
turned for Oates being much great
er than the entire registration, the
evidence of fraud is conclusive.
Prior to the registration law it
was more difficult to furnish de
tailed proof of the frauds but now
to establhsh the fact beyond dispute
it Is only necessary to prove that
the voe ot ais returned for Oates isa
greater than the total registration,
which is known to be the case
throughout the black district.
When the vote for Oatea is reduc
ed to the actual registration and
without giving Kolb a vote, in 4
those couinties where the frauds are
apparent it ~ives Kolb a majority
in the state.

Valuable Statistics in Regard
to Mileage, 'irale a1and In
debtedness.
The New York Sun says there
are more miles of railroad track
in the United States than in all
the other countries of the world
conlbined. These are the figures:
United States, 172,000 miles;
Europe, Asia, Africa, South, Cen
tral, and British America, and Aus
tralia, 167,000 miles.
The number of locomotive en
ginlues ill use on American railroads
is 85,(1K0. The number of passen
ger cars is 28,000. The number of
mail and baggage cars is 8,000 and
the 'umber of freight and coal
cars is 1,2o0,000.
As respects mileage the Atchi
son, Topeka and Santa Fe stands
at the head with 7,125 miles opera
Sted ; next comes the Southern Pa
cific with 6,500;. then St. Paul
with 6,083. Louisville and Nash
uvile 4,700, then Northern Pacific
4,400. Chicago and Northwest
4,300, Rock Island 3,500, Illinois
Central 2,900, Pennsylvania 2,500,
r New York Central 2,100, and Bal
timore and Ohio, Wabash, and
Erie with 1,009 each.
º As respects the volume of gross
receipts the Pennsylvania stands
at the head with $130,000,000, the
Southern Pacific second with $50,
000,000, and then the New York
Central with $45,000,000, Delaware,

000,000 each.
The railroadls of the country car
ry in a year 600,000,000 passengers
and transport 800,000,000 tons ot
freight. The disparity betwteen the
two branches of transportation is
much greater here than it is in Eu
rope, for the foreign railroads carry
twice as many passengers as do
the railroads of the United States,
whereas the earnings from freight
or "goods" trains, as they are call
ed abroad, just above balance. In
this country the earnings from
freight business are about three
times greater tl a for passenger
business. "
The gross indebtedness, stock
and bonds, of the railroads of the
United States is in excess of 810,
000,000,000. and is increasing at a
more rapid ratio than thei milage of

Up to the financial panic of Ju
ly, 18,93, the tendency of the large
Srailroad systems was toward ab
sorbing the small ones:. but since
the beginning of the era of receiv.
erships many of the large systems
have been dismembered so that
there are actually many more sep
arate railroad corporations than
there were a year ago, though there
has been no increase in railroad
building.

Gov. Waite, of Colo'ada, iS un

The governor denied that he hadl

that his bond be fixed at $53,000,
replied:
"I am governor of this State and
these proceedings are held to in

bail. You may send me to jail, but
I will not give bail."
