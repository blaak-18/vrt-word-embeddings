A CLEVER SATIRE. P
We have before us, says a Lis
ville paper, several private lers
from Southerners settle in Norbrn
Ohio, which leave us no rooe to Ii
doubt the bitter hostility whiclpx c
ists in that region against the Ost n
'I well-disposed persons of rebel toe
cedents. We have long suspect4as ii
much. At length the damning pof it
reaches us, and we demand thathe N
Sfirst act of the next Congress shalbe tl
the total reconstruction of the (.v- p
eland district, that the whole er
of the army and navy be put fi, if
need be, and that sentries be ped, s
like lamp posts from one end du le1
lid avenue to the oilier antw, ,
reverence and order are *s) d. ce
But to our testimony.
A veteran soldier who sertd .
lantly with Morgan's cavalh,, rites tl
his old partner in Lexiuton, .y., s
from Cleveland. "Thing ain
on poorly with me, paild Wen 1
). ukored that old fool out of hat land i
I writ you about, and Fot the des- i
tillery, I thought I ha truckile.
Well I did make, two or tree con- t
siderable winni'Jgs. But s is the a
cunsedest country youv e. One O
night last Spring the boys as hav
ing a little spree-I do no ow how b
V it was-but one of the ows got
knocked on the head, ,or mething, n
and I thought it best to lope i so
herr I am in Cleveland wit at a cent,
Scan't go back to the farm, in't able
to raise a stake, and- ll, that's e
bad enough, and serves moip. Noth- tl
n log good can come out Nazarith. v
Send me ten dollars to pajny board a
bill, and as much more you can t
spare." o
No one ever read this tier with- t
out a burning sense of nagnation.
The writer is not a po ianu. He -
plays asquare a game f cards as
Dick Parson. But he is 'ven from
his home and finds him f a weary I t
wanderer on the soundin and ever- i
lasting shores of Lake ie, unable a
to raise a stake and not asire of being i
able to sustain his much tduced cre- o(
dit at his boarding-house: j
The next letter, anmog those for- e
warded to us for perusal;and public- r
ation, is most heart renting becanse b
it Is from a lady. She writes to a c
sister in Louisville: "When the bal
loon busted at Cincinbati, Henry ,
thought he would try his lack in c
Cleveland, and we came to this be
nighted, God-forsaken town. It is
perfectly awful. Henry went into c
partners with a Chicago man named a
McKissick. The saloon did very well s
teo Al~!g~rr t into a fight with one
pistol on the reporter.
'"Since then people say he is a dan
gerous man, and custom has dropped r
off. But the worst- part remains to
be told. The grand dames on Euclid
avenue carry themselves, mighty
haughty. Would you believe it ?
I have not received a single call. It's
because I was a Secesh girl before my
marriage-which heaven knows, was f
the right cause-and I wish Henry t
would try his hand at keno, for the 1
saloon don't pay, no how."
We migh quote fifty letters or more
to' the same purport. But enough.
These will show the spiteful temper
of Northern Ohio. The men are bit
ter and vengeful. The women are
proud and exclusive. We have tried
to think differently, but we cannot
resist evidence as the foregoing.
GOOD FIsnsNm oN DaR LAND--The
Rochester Democrat tell this little
fishing incident: Shortly after 2 o'clock
yesterday morning Joseph Pierce,
who lives- at 30 University avenue,
was aroused by a strange noise. By
thedinilight in the room he saw a
fish-pole above his bed and also saw
that some one was pusiing it trough
the window. He jumped from his
ecoch and at the same time saw the
fish-poledisappear thbrgh the win
dow, abd heard the sound of steps
without The poller were called and
a search was instituted. In the yard
the fish-pole was found with a large
hook attatched to st. In Mr. Pierce's
room, which was on the second fltor,
were two watebhei vduid at $900, one
of whicb, had disappeared. The
thieves had monoted a shed, put the
fish-pole'through the wiidow and
poceeded to fish fort the watches.
hey hkad succeeded in secaring one
snd were busily employed in angling
for theother when Mr. Pierce awoke
and discovered their game. The bed
was between th win~dow and bureau,
and in ordef to fslthuemleTualy +the
barglar had to paes the fih-pole
over the sleepaing form of Mr. P oiere,
who, was much surprised to see it
above him when he opened his eyes.
No trace, of the lost watch or the
strange fishermen has yet been fond.

The Last Cry.
PATHETIC INCIDENT OF TiHE LOSS OF
THE SCHILLER.
"The last cry heard was that of a sl
little child in the cabin." So runs the SI
cold and formal dispatch which an- gi
nounces the bleaking up of the Schil- In
ler, and the loss of more tithan 300 fr
lives. A little child in the cabin, and ti
its poor infantile appeal for help! fe
Not all the tragedy of that sad a2air, c'
the death of the noble Captain at his fa
post,- we hope, as became a man and w
a seaman ; the ending of the struggle gi
with death upon the sharp rocks of gi
Scilly, which tihe gallant sailorsdoubt- n4
less fought, or the drowning of tle 84
women who were on board, pitiful ti'
creatures whlose hair is already turn. P
ed to sea,.-weed-none of these fates P'
equal that of the child whose cry was in
the last sound heard as the noble ll
ship struck the cruel rock. It seemts c
almost like a violation of the sancti- la
ty of grief, like an invasion of the
heart that moans and refuses to be to
healed of the sorrow that will not be te
comforted, to mention this thing, but
the cry of that child will be heard 4i
around the globe, piercing the ear Ili
and rending the heart of every man d4
who reads the story. A little child! ti'
What magic there is in these words!
What cords do they touch! What cc
memories revive I A little child,
pure and fresh, the handiwork of the be
Maker, before the debasing breath of bl
earth had struck it. Sweet and in- s<
nocent, the image of his Maker and B
the reflection of angels. We do not Ju
wish to be accused of sentimentalism, ti
nor do we desire to be pathetic, but
the involuntary touch of the telegraph It
operator upon the key be struck in th
the brief sentence we have quoted,
will vibrate through a million hearts in
-one touch of nature makes the M
whole world kin. B
It is needless now to speculate upon
the future of that little child had he
lived, and it was perhaps ordered T"
wisely and well that he should die as et
he did. The ocean is the graveyard d<
of greater dead than the earth, and to
in its bosom, uncotliaed and unknell- t.
ed, lie some of the world's best he-. c
roes. Westminister Abbey is no no- of
Sber tomb than the dark, unfathomed BI
caves of the ocean, wherein lie those Ia
who died that others might live, and
who perished in the most unselfish di
cause for which man can die-thew'
preservation of the lives of their fel
low beings. Let as hope that tile a
child was saved-the stories ruun that
way-telling us not only of the brands
snatched from the burning, but of si
wrecks east upoe the shore, that aa
I ears bor themmslma u ,ely rt

our youth, was a wah.lt - ' n
ranks of heroism compared with
child who made his voice heard above a
the roar of the winds, the rash of the. d
waters, and tihe thunder of the break- "
ere, the night the good ship Schliller b
went down. Perhaps his father had re
been swept into the sea an hour be d
fore; doubtless he laid warm upon "
the cold breast of his dead mother, i
but that cry which rouses the best e
nature of man, and has sometimes
stayed the murderer's hand, was
heard above the din of the waves, a8
r and at the mercy of heaven itself; C
for was It not lie who said, "Suffer p
little children to come unto me, for of. i
sach is the kingdom of Heaven." n

Sorry He Wasn't There.
I have referred in my book to that tl
SCorenere of ouars who seised an Egypt- o
isa mummy that was brought into *
town, summoned ajory, held an in. '
quest on the mummy, brought in a
verdict uf "Death from causes un- a
Sknpwn," and charged the eountry
with the usual fee, with compound in- q
terest from the time of Moses. Well,
that Coroner is still in olie, and L h
is still eimthusiastic about iis profei
stion. Last Sunday night he wasat a
church. The minister preached a ver t
solemn sermon upon Noahi's rd t
and after it was over I met the Cog
oner in theaisle and said to him :
S "Very impressive discourse, Mr.
Wheeler, wasn't it s ?
"Beautiful, sir I beautiful,n replied
Wheeler, "Audyet it seemaed to be
kinder mouranul, too." p
"Indeed! Why, it diIl't strike me
in that way. It was solemn, of couarsie;
but its tendeny eraoly should be o
to fill the hearts every truly bod
man with cbheefalues and hope. ,
"Oh I know all that," said Wheel. t
Ser, bufdidu't he msay that there were t
bevraal million ipeople drowned in I
that flood f"
"I believe hbe did." re
"Well, then, I say that when Ia

Politics Made Profitable.
F From the New York Tribune.
To-day I met General Beverly _
Nash, who is considered one of the
a shrewdest politicians of his color in
e South Carolina. His African pro
- genitor could not have surpassed him
. in blackness. He was a slave until
o freed by tile Emancipation Ptoclama
I tion, and dining the war was a Con- t
! federate officer's body servant. Re
r, construction brought him to tihe sur
s face and threw hin into official life,
a where his hard sense and quick wit
e gave him prominence in his party and t
,f great popularity with his race. He i
;_ now represents Columbia in the State o
e Senate, and is a Regent of the Luna
1 tio Asylum and a Director of the
Penitentiary. His devotion to the
a public service has been a profitable i
investment. He resides in a fine d
e mansion in a pleasant quarter of the b
city, and is reputed to have $100,000 it
_ laid by for a rainy day. cl
e "What do you think of the third- 0
e term question--of Grant for a third e
e term I" I asked.
t "It ain't no us talkin', sah, ef Grant's N
d gets de nomination, we're gwine for
,r him. South Carolina 'I vote for the
n devil if he runs on the Republican it
ticket." c
"What do you think of him as a
t candidate for nomination t"
, 'ýDat's alittle harder question. Meb- tl
e be he don't stand well up yo' way, si
if but he's a mighty strong man with us, a
sah ; mighty. De cullud people stick si
a squar up to him right straight along, ri
t just like he stood alongside of us in tl
, the Ku-Klux business."
t "But, Senator," said my compan- h
h ion, "we can't carry the election with ri
n tie vote of South Carolina alone. it
, The Northern States insist upon hav- ci
lbing somebody else. Why can't we ti
e atl agree upon some man such as el
Blaine t ri
n "Well, sah, so far as I go I haven't t4
e got nothm' ag'inst Blaine, ef he is put as
a forahd. I like Mr. Blaine well p
Senough. He's got some good friends fa
d down heah. Blane was mighty kind cl
a to me once. Mebbe you don't know ai
that me and Cardota was the first ci
cullud men that ever sot on the fio'
of do House of Representatives, and
SBlaine he was Spelaker, and he paid T
e as a heap of attention." ai
j I remarked as i we were about to o0
l drive away that I should like to talk re
s with him again. hi
"Iow long are you gwine to stay, as
e sah t" e
,t "I expect to remain until Monday." ti
"You might have a talk to-morrow," fi0
if suggested my companion. it

ts HONOn TO MRs. STONEWALL JACK- t
s, N.--The handsomest thing of the
f; Centennial occasion was the honor
ar paid Mrs. Stonewall Jackson by the t
tf Raleigh light artillery, and by the a
Raleigh light infantry, and by the
steam fire company of Newboern, and
the citizens' band of the same place.
The Raleigh companies both ealled at
Sthe residence of Col. John E. Brown,
Son North Trade street, where Mrs.
SJackson lives, and gave three cheers
Sfor her. In response to these Misst
a Julia, the only daughter of the Im- t
mortal Stonewall, came out and preo i
smutoed both companies with a bou
quet, after which, upon returning to 1
I, camp, each of the companies fired a
salute in honor of the widow of the
J Christain hero. The Newbern band
and fire company called also and gave
three cheers for Mrs. Jackson. They,
too, were presented with flowers by
Miss Julia, after which the firemen
were .received by and shook hands
Swith Mr. Jaeksono They spent a few
Smoments in the parlor, looking at a
d large portrait of thie General, then
silently departed, many of them wip
plung away the fast falling tears.

How II SAVED A CnOKING CHILD.
Y -A correspondent, writing from Re
e no, New., to the Sacramento Union,
tells how he saved the life of a chiht.
lIe writes: "I was engaged in haul
ing wood from a timber ranch to
Austin, Reese River, Nev. Theru
was a house over the summnit from
the abolve place, where resided two
tanilies belonging to the wood-chop
pe .s, and on arriving in sight of the
house a woman came out and beck
t oned me to make haste, that some
d thing was wrong. I did so, and just
C in time, for the other woman came
° out holding a child in her arms, ap
parently dead. It was black in the
e face. She told me the child had been
e eating pine-nuts, and had got a shell
° in its throat, had choked, and was
° dying. I immediately got a piece of
e board about four feet long and placed
0it across the door-sill. She sat the
child on one end and I tipped the
other, making a sudden jar, whiceh
caused the shell to pass downward,
and gave the child immediate relief.
s No person can imagine how over-i
r joyed that mother was for saving her
a only child. I know of several cases
Sin which this process has proved sue
eesful."
The Neck.-Perfect health demands
that the clothing about the neck
, should be very moderate in quantity,
, and worn so loose, as to "prevent the
slightest compression. The great er
, ror frequently committed in clothing
a this part of the body consists in
wearing such an amount as to over
heat and weaken the throat, and thus
Ii render it easily succeptible to cold, or
! in wearing it so tight as to retard the
- circulation of the blood to and from
e the head. Great care should be ex
a ercised upon this point, as the arte
ries and veins leading from the heart
t to the brain are situated so n ar the
t surface in the neck that a slight co.m
I pression there serves to ch-k the
a flow of the blood. Many cases of
I congestion of the brain and headache
r are caused by too tight collars and
t cravats.
1 A Few Needed Small Things.
1 There are a great many farms that
are supplied with the best of all kinds
, of large field. implements, such as
