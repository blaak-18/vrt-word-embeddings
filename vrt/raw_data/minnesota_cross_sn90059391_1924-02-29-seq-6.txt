New Structure
MARSHALLTOWN, IA, Feb. 25.
The following statement was printed
in The Times-R<epublican of this
place, recently. In it, H. C. Mueller,
E resident of the Marshalltown school
oard sets down the educational con
ditions in his city in concise form.
The school board here seeks the
aid of all citizens in bettering con
ditions. The board president invites
constructive criticism from voters.
The statement, because its con
tents will be of interest throughout
the entire state, is printed herewith
in full:
To the Tax Payers: It may be a
little uncommon but not wholly in
discreet if I as president of the
achool board attempt to give a few
facts pertaining to the board’s work
done in the past and some ideas of
future needs.
We, no doubt, will all agree that
no investment that ever has been
made in Marshalltown pays such a
great dividend considering training
and development for the tasks of
men and women of tomorrow, as we
receive from our public school sys
tem.
There are problems that must be
aatisfactorily disposed of in order to
maintain our place among the ac
credited high schools of the state.
The demand for a new high school
at this time is paramount with all of
us, considering our crowded condi
tion and the fact that we must resort
to the use of temporary buildings in
our high school. Our present build
ing was originally erected to accom
modate 500 pupils but at this time
we have, including the eight grade,
an enrollment of over 900.
This condition is only for the
present, and not making any allow
ance for the increased requiremeat
of 1926, which will be about as soon
aa any new program can be carried
out.
The temporary “coops” which we
are compelled to use are certainly
nothing more than a “bridge-over” to
our real need. Then, too, having no
elevator service it is almost an un
pardonable condition to compel

CROSS BURNED ON ICE
OF MISSISSIPPI RIVER
Burlington Klansmcn, in Full
Regalia, Distribute
Papers
BURLINGTON, IA, Feb. 23.—A
week ago tonight, members of the lo
cal Klan burned a fiery cross on the
ice of the Mississippi river. Jeffer
son street, the main business street
of the city, was crowded with the
Saturday night crowd, when the blaz
ing emblem of the Klan burst into
flames in the middle of the stream.
Some fanatic took it up*n himself
to cut one of the wires holding up
the cross, and it fell to the ice. Un
til that time it presented a beautiful
sight, and thousands of people wit
nessed it.
At the same time, a large number
of robed Klansmen appeared in the
down-town district and distributed
copies of The lowa Fiery Cross.
Burlington Klan is growing at a
rapid rate. The burning of the cross
and the appearance of the Klansxien
has informed the people that the
Klan is active in the city.
growing girls to climb five flights of
stairs to some of their class rooms.
True we have same antiquated
grade school buildings. To the Ab
bott and the Rogers must be given
the credit as the pioneers of the
structures of yesterday. At the time
these buildings were erected it was
not with the same demand and re
quirement that we would make to
day. However all these grade schools
were thoroughly repaired during the
summer of 1923, under the direction
of the building and grounds commit
tee and by James Jensen, supervisor
*f the buildings. New fixtures were
installed in all of these buildings at
that time, making them, as we be
believe, temporarily satisfactory for
the present need.
It is the purpose of the school
board to have a survey and inspec
tion made of all the grade school
buildings to secure unbiased opinion
as to where our immediate need may
be.
Over a period of two years we
have had the following building ac
tivities.
1. On July 1, 1922, we retired
bonds to the amount of $32,000.00
and on July 1, 1923, we retired $15,-
000.00, making a total of $47,000.00.
Previous to that a total of $8,000.00
in bonds was retired over a period of
forty years.
2. Erected the Aaron Palmer
building which took approximately
$25,000 in excess of the bond issue.
3. Expended $6,500 on Franklin
field.
4. Started a general renovation
of seats in all buildings. All those
east of Center street were taken care
of last year, and we are planning to
take care of those west of Center
street during the coming year.
5. Bought ground for new high
school site, having, with the excep
tion of two lots, purchased the bal
ance of lots necessary to complete
the site from Palace court on the
east to the rear of lots facing on
South Twelfth street on the west and
from Boone street on the south to
the rear of the lots facing on Church
street on the north.
6. Employed a certified public ac
countant to examine all school ex
penditures and make suggestions in
all matters of accounting that was
deemed necessary to our system.
These are major propositions that
the school board has had to work out
besides innumerable smaller details
that naturally must be cared for
each month .
,1 desire to say to the public' that
the members of the school board
continually invite and ask construc
tive criticism. Destructive criticism
is always a barrer and hindrance to
a perfected public school system.
The school board likewise invites co
operation, which is the vital issue
for the success of a well-governed,
thoroughly organized school. Every
committee on the board has exhib-,
ited a fine spirit in doing the tasks
of its respective work with a view
of unity for the whole board that is
seldom found.
I therefor commend to the public
the worthy and unbiased efforts of
every member of the board and urge
the sincere co-operation of every
citizen in the tasks of maintaining
the high standard of our public
school system. H. C. Mueller, presi
dent school board.

RING OF OFFICIALS
PROTECT CRIMINALS
Fairmont, W. Va., Vice Condi
tions Are Exposed—Klan
Stands for Law
FAIRMONT, W. VA.. Feb. 25.—De
spite efforts of Marion county citi
zens to put an end to the manufac
ture of illicit liquor in Fairmont,
Doc Bostic, colored king of local
bootleggers, continues to make
“moonshine” booze at his Pennsyl
vania Avenue joint, under the pro
tection of the court house ring. The
ring has made several attempts to
destroy and discredit the Ku Klux
Klan.
Bostic is a purveyor of bonds for
dope peddlers. He has been arrested
several times since September 28.
last. Police have raided Bostic’s
place five times and found liquor
each time. The largest amount
found at any single raid was 18 gal
lons.
He was arraigned before United
States Commissioner George Harry
Gordon, Clarksburg, on a charge of
having moonshine liquor in his pos
session. Mayor Buckley’s men nad
raided his place and found the booze.
When arraigned before the commis
sioner, Bostic procured aid from the
local court house and the federal
government was unable to produce a
case against him. He plead guilty
to a liquor charge before a local
magistrate and was sentenced to
serve 30 days in the Marion county
jail. It is alleged that he served
only about 10 days.
Despite the fact that county offi
cials are protecting criminals Judge
Emmett M. Showalter and Sheriff
Charleton, the two highest officers
in Marion county, are openly opposed
to the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
They claim the Klan is an out-law or
ganization and is attempting to
usurp law enforcement.
The Knignts of the Ku Klux Klan
stand for law enforcement and are
especially in favor of enforcement
of the eighteenth amendment. It
is said that Doc Bostic brags that
he now “has it fixed” and people can j
call him on the 'phone for liquor. |
With whom did Bostoc fix it? How
much did it coat if anything?
Do the county officials really be
lieve that the Ku Klux Klan is a
lawless organization? The recent
Kand jury returned 163 indictments
far as known none of those In
dicted were members of the Ku Klux
Klan. The Ku Klux Klan, as an or
ganization, does not protect any vio
lations of the law.
INITATE 500 MEMBERS
ADRAIN, MICH., Feb. 26.—Five
hundred candidates were initiated
into the order of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan at a meeting here
last week. The big problem with
the organizaation now is how to rb
tain a hall large enough to accom
modate those who wish to attend
the meetings.
OKLAHOMA PEOPLE
ARE NOT OPPOSED
TO KO KLOX KLAN
Blake Making Futile Effort
To Get 42,000 “Anti”
\ T ames on Petition
NO REAL OPPOSITION
Immunity of Un-American Dis
pro'rs Wild Charges Against
American Order
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA., Feb. 25.
—There is not to be found 42,000
person.' in the entire state of Okla
homa who wish to record themselves
as opposed to the Ku Klux Klan.
There are approximately two and
a quarter million people in this
state.
Of this two and a quarter million
the K m has not even 40,000 ill
wishei' no, nor yet 30,000.
For three long months Alrich
Blake with the assistance of the ma
chineiv of the anti-Klan association,
has be ii scouring Oklahoma in a
desperate and futile attempt to pro
cure the necessary 42 000 signatures
to hi' initiative petitiop for a law
to unmask the Klan membership.
Two conclusions may be drawn
from the complete and ultimate
fiasco of Blake’s campaign against
the klan.
Tho tirst is, that the people of Ok
lahoma are in sympathy with the
Ku Klux Klan and its principles,
and do not wish to see the organiza
tion damaged or handicapped in its
work of uplift by an enforced publi
cation of its membership.
The second is, that a great major
ity of the non-Klan population was
not increased with the inflamma
tory abuse of Blake and Walton
against the organization, and, there
fore. unconcerned as to who the
members are.
Perhaps both concltfsions combine
to explain Blake’s failure.
However, the result of the canvass
is an irrefutable proof that there is
no organized or articulate public op
position to the Ku Klux Klan in Ok
lahoma today.
It is anticipated that Blake will
now come forward with an “alibi”
that voters were fearsome of “Klan
intimidation” and therefore hesitant
about signing their names to the
petition.
That explanation will_.be scarcely
convincing, since he himself, the
Klan’s arch enemy, has been free to
bemean and slander the order from
one end of the state to another,
without let or hindrance. In a num
ber of counties where the local offi
cials were Klansmen, public build
ings and court rooms were thrown
op-n to him for his anti-Klan meet
ings.
If conditions in Oklahoma had
really been what Jack Walton and
Blike and the Allen controlled press
of the state and nation have been
trying to delude us into believing,
Alrich Blake would have been flog
ged. tarred and feathered, or possi
bly assasinated before he had can
vassed two weeks.
So now, with Blake’s “war on the
Klan” safely over without any casu
alties, doubters outside the state may
know at last with certainty that the
crn-piracy against the Ku Klux Klan
in Oklahoma was bottomed upon the
most astounding and monstrous lie
ever foisted upon the people of an
enlightened nation!
Blake’s fight is over. He was a
valiant campaigner and we admire
his pluck, if not his good sense and
sound judgment.
But it was a losing fight from the
beginning. One cannot long breast
the current of progress and make
headway. Blake, it is to be hoped
has learned that, if nothing else.
It is a well known fact that Aid
rich Blake attempted to obtain
membership in the Klan at Muskogee
at the inception of the Klan in Ok
lahoma, but the Klan wanted none
of him nor his kind. Forthwith “Sir”
Aldrich started his campaign of
abuse and villification of the organi
zation, and, as stated, his latest ven
ture has been a dismal failure.
The Klan had no objections to
Blake’s public fight upon the order.
llis was the right to make that fight
and circulate his petition—the right
of a free American citizen, the right
vvhich Klansmen, bound by their
iealtv to the constitution and the

Northern Counties
Produce Best
lowa Corn
SPIRIT LAKE IA., Feb. 25.
One of the very interesting things
brought out in the lowa corn
yield contest the past year is the
fact that the northern sections of
counties in lowa, averaged more
than the southern section. An
other feature of special import
ance is finding a yellow corn
which will equal the famous Sil
ver King variety and may even
preve a rival to it. Six out of the
seven top yielding samples from
the northern section wer® yellow
varieties. A variety known as
Smith's Yellow Dent yielded 61.5
bushels per acre in the official
test compiled by the association.
George Steen, of West Liberty,
la., was the winner for the entire
state on his Read’s Yellow Dent,
with 68.7 bushels per acre.
These corn yield tests are bring
ing out some very important facts
concerning corn production and
much effort is being put forth to
secure a high yielding yellow corn
for northern lowa.
PORTSMOUTH. 0.. Feb. 26—The ar
