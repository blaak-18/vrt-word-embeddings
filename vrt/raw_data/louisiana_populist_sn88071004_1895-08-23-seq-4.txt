.4When I was farming in Caroiina,"
says an old Connecticut fellow, ""I got
ahe of providence in the hailstone
bus eas. After I planted my crop of
tob cco I rigged up a line of poles
the" entire length of the field. with
ropes stretching from pole to pole,
and to those ropes I attached a cloth
material not so stiff as crinoline nor
so flexible as cambric. By a system
of pulleys any one standing at the
edge of the lield could pull the main
guy rope and in live seconds the en
tire c·rop would be covered by this
curtain or awning. I was taken ill
about this time and my physician told
me I must go to California for my
health, so I went, but before going
I instructed iny wife how to work my
device and told her that whenever
she saw a storm ooming to cover the
crop." "And so the hail never dam
uged your tobacco?" inquired the
little man with the chin whiskers.
- No, sir, never touched it. But,
then, you see," he added, taking a
long pull at his pipe, -"there wasn't
any tobacco to ruin, for every time a
storm came up my wife drew the cur
tains and the crop literally died from
drougth."
To oe Sure.
The interstate commerce law is
daily demonstrating its extreme
width; it covers everything. North
Carolina has a law requiring a dealer
in pianos to take out a license of $250.
W. J. Hough of Asheville, handling
pianos for a Chicago lirm. refused to
pay the license, and was brought be
fore the courts. The judge decided
that the law was unconstitutional, as
it interfered with interstate com

THE BANKER'S IDEA OF A "SOUND" SILVER DOLLAR.
,,
HISTORY REPEATED.
DRED SCOTT AND INCOME TAX
CASES ARE ANALOGOUS.
The Decision In the Former Case De
lighted the Holders of the Illack
Slaves-The White slave, Now the
Vlctlms.
The decision of the United States Su
preme court, in the Dred Scott case in
1857, elated the slave holders of the
south no less than the recent decision
of the Supreme court on the income tax,
elate the plutocratic bondholders of the
east and the north.
The decision in the Dred Scott case
followed a great national political vic
tory by the democratic party-a party
which had been the friend and advo
cate of the doctrine of slavery.
The income tax decision follows the
political victory of the republican party
-a party which has been the friend and
advocate of plutocracy and class legis
lation.
The advocates of slavery regarded the
decision of this high court as a final
settlement of a question which had two
sides to it.
But the decision did not settle the
question. It aroused indignation and
cemented opposition. The people dis
trusted the patriotism and honesty of
the members of the court-a four years'
war destroyed slavery and amended the
constitution.
The millionaires and bondholders of
the north and east may regard the in
come tax decision as a final settlement
of the question of the proteqted classes
against the unprotected masses. But
it has not settled it and will not set
tie it.
The doctrine that those who have
money derived from the renting of real
estate, or from the leasing or using of
tangible personal property, or who own
invested personal property, have tax
privileges that cannot be accorded to
those who have money derived from
the labor of their hands, the sweat of
their brow or the exercise of their skill,
is a doctrine that cannot stand in
America.
Justice Harlan in his dissenting
opinion put the case mildly when he
said "are those in whose behalf argu
ments are made that rest upon favorit
ism by the law making power aware
that they are provoking a contest which,
in some countries, has swept away in
a tempest of frenzy and passion, exist
ing social organizations, and put in
peril all that was dear to the friends
of law and order?"
Thomas Jefferson understood and
feared the power of a corrupt judiciary
when he wrote Mr. Coray as follows:
"At the establishment of our consti
tution the judicial bodies were supposed
to be the most helpless and harmless
members of the government. Experi
ence, however, soon showed in what
way they were to become the most
dangerous-that the insufficiency of
the means provided for their removal
gave them a freehold and irresponsi
bility in ofice; that their decisions,
seeming to concern individual suitors
only, pass silent and unheeded by the
public at large; that these decisions,
nevertheless, become law by prece
dent, sapping little by little the foun
datioen of the constitution and work
ing its change by construction before
any one has perceived that that invisi
ble worm has been busily employed in
consuming its substance."
Has not subsequent history conferred
upon the utterance of Jefferson the dig
nity of prophecy?
The Dred Scott decision seemed "to
concern individual suitors only," but
being contrary to the public sentiment
existing at the time ef its rendering
it took on national and sectional im
portance and resulted in installing the
"third," or minority, political party in
to power and control of the govern
ment.
The income tax decision sets at
naught all precedents of law; denounces
the legislative branch of the govern
ment as a set of demagogues and nin
compoops; violates public sentiment
and attempts to establish a monled
autoeracy.
The further fact of.the equal division
of the bench upon this question when
It was irst argued, and the subsequent
chaunge of opinion by Justic Shiras, by
whieh the masrty eC 9e wma 9btai4ed

against the law, will not impede the
possibility of history repeating itself.
-People's Party Paper.
MORGAN ON SILVER.
The Ir.'e Sllver Fly Invited Into the
Gold stL.ndard Spider's Parlor.
At the session of the silver conven
tion in Memphis, a letter from Senator
John T. Morgan, of Alabama, was pre
sented, but was not read, on account
of the press business before the con
vention. In it the senator said: "This
convention at Memphis is the natural,
if not necessary, result of the popular
meeting held there under the patron
age and approval of our Democratic
administration, and it will be a pro
test against the platform adopted un
der such auspices in hostility to the
established creed of the Democratic
party.
"They have appealed against the
judgment of the party so often pro
nounced in support of the equal rights
of gold and silver at the mints, and
they demand that this appeal shall be
heard and decided outside the counsels
of the Democratic party by a general
muster of all the enemies of silver
money to be found in every political
organization. We invite all the friends
of money that was 'sound' until silver
was Struck below the fifth rib by its
jealous brother, and, having survived
the assassin, is still 'sound,' to come
into the Democratic camp. and to aid
us in healing the wounds of this faith
ful servant of the people and the gov
ernment. Under the Bland act and
the Sherman act we paid all the bonds
in reach of the government, and now we
are issuing bonds at the rate of $4.
200,000,000 a year, and are sending our
assistant secretary to London to sign
thme and deliver them to the Roths
childs.
"Under the Bland-Allison act we had
a surplus of $100,000,000 at the end of
,Mr. Cleveland's first term, and now we
have a deficit of $100,000,000 In the
midst of Mr. Cleveland's second term.
"The people are growing weary of
this grind, and they feel it, and'in all
their interests they have already
learned by experience the true situa
tion, and they will not unlearn these
sad lessons in any new school that is
set up to conduct this campaign of ed
ucation.
"Our duty as Democrats is a possible
one, and is to follow the old leaders and
look more closely to our political lead
ers."
"It was not read on account of the
press of business." That's what the
papers stated. The real reason is be
cause It too plainly disclosed the ob
jects of the meeting, so far as the poli
ticians were concerned. We have no
doubt but that many Democrats who
attended the Memphis silver conven
tion were honest and sincere in their
motives. There- is no doubt in our
minds but that the Populists who at
tended that convention were also hon
est in their Intentions. They, as well
as others, were invited there, believing
that It was to be a nonpartisan affair,
and that its real object was to make an
honest effort to have free coinage of
silver restored to the people. If the
above letter leaves any doubt that this
and all kindred conventions are fran
tic efforts to prevent the disintegration
of the Democratic party in the South
and West, the following expressions
from two of the most prominent Demo
crats, who were present, are certainly
sufficient to remove that doubt. It is
true that in opening the convention,
Senator Harris said: "It was strictly a
nonpartisan organization, composed of
Democrats, Republicans and Populists.
Its doors were open to every American
citizen, who honestly believed in the
propriety, the advisability and the ne
cessity of the rehabilitation of silver."
Before the convention adjourned
Senators Harris, Turpie and Jones
were appointed a committee to select a
national committee, consisting of one
man from each State to work to ad
vance the cause of silver.
This committee met, and Ses~aor
Harris said:
"The league will be purely a Demo
cratic organization formed for the pur
pose of securing a perfect organization
of the silver Democrats in the country
for the purpose of controlling the ut
terances of the next national Demderat
ie convention upon the floancial ques
tion. I have no doubt that the great
majority of the people are In favor of
free coilnag.e Ilt unless thley organeze it
will I, impossible for them to make the
next platform."
"You clearly understand." put In
Senator Jones. "that this movement Is
strictly within the lines of the I)emo
cratic party, and we want the country
to understand that. The organization
of silver advocates in an independent
body without partisan character can
not have the effect of civing or gaining 1
strength to silver Democrats in a way
that will enable them to control the 1
sending of their delegates to the vari
ous conventions. An organization I
within the lines of the lemocratic I
party, like the proposed, is absolutel.
essential to the success of the issue In
our next national convention."
A Texas paper, commenting on this
action. says:
"Senator llarris also emphasized the
fact that the National Bimetallic
League is to be a Democratic organiza
tion.
"And a Democratic organization it is.
from each State on the executive com
mittee, with authority to call a conven
tion for permanent organization. which
will be held in Chicago sometime in
July. Tile question is. what were the
Republicans and Populists Invited to
Memphis for? And will any of them
be big enough fools to attend the sec
ond meeting at Chicago?"
We have no criticisms for the Popu
lists who attended that convention. We
believe that they did it in perfectly 1
good faith, and with the best of objects.
But the question might be asked, what
did we gain? If the masses controlled
the conventions, something might be
gained, for they are honest; but every
time we meet with the Derocratic poli
ticlans our reputation will be smirched.
even if our objects are good. We all
know the story of old Tray. A man
who knows the baneful results of a gold
standard, and knows the record of the
Democratic and Republican parties on
that question. and who has not the mor
al courage and sterling honesty to get
out of the old rotten hulk that foisted l
it on the country, will not do to trust.
no matter how many resolutions he
passes or silver conventions he favors.
These silver conventions are being held
for the purpose of deceiving the masses
into the belief that the Democratic par
ty will reste!,-4/ree silver coinage, and
to prevent the voters from leaving the
party to the end that a few men can
be elected to office and enjoy the privi
leges of no work and a big fat salary.
There is just one free silver party in
the country, and when a man is really
sincere in his advocacy of free silver.
he will most certainly vote with that
party In preference to either of the two
gold bug parties.
In speaking of the corruption which i
has grown utip among us. Governor Alt
geld recently said:
"Just see what a brood of evils have
sprung from the power of capitalism
since 1870. 1. The striking down of
over one-third of the money of the
world, thus crushing the debtor class
and paralyzing the industry. 2. The
growing of that corrupt use of wealth
which is undermining our institutions,
debauching public officials, shaping
legislation and creating judges who do
its bidding. 3. Exemption of the rich
from taxation. 4. The substitution of
government by injunction for govern
ment by the constitution and laws. 5.
The striking down of trial by jury.
Never has there been so much patri
otic talk as in the last twenty-five years
and never were there so many in
fluences at work strangling republican
institutions."
It will require something more than
a single plank, or even currency reform.
to reach the great evils that threaten
our liberties.
Brooks and the Episeopl Churrch.
The Rev. William M. Brundage, of
Albany, speaking before the American
Unitarian Association in Boston on
Tuesday evening, said: "Five years
ago Bishop Brooks, then Dr. Brooks,
when I called upon him to ask him
about fellowship in the Bpiscopal
Church, for I was uneasy and restless,
told me that he would not advise any
young man in search of freedom to go
into the Episcopal Church. Just four
weeks before Bishop Brooks died he
told a personal friend of mine that he
would not advise him to go into the
Episcopal Church la search of free

That is the time to take Dr. Pierce's Gold
