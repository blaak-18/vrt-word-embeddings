WHEN HEARTS
“Ever morning wore to evening,
But some heart did break. ”
N GREGG’S ALLEY, where lived
the stoop-shouldered woman,
who was being blown—actually
blown, around the corner, that
almost twilight hour of a No-
I
vember afternoon, by a vehement
burst of rain and wind —the inmates
of her street would doubtless have
characterized this steady downpour
as a “devilish hard rain.” The
Greggsonlan method of speech mere
ly states facts, without any polishing
or “fur-belows.”
About her shoulders, the woman
clutched wildly a faded bit of plaid
shawl —she was hatless. To an on
looker, the shawl seemed to have
been added to her wardrobe as an
afterthought. There was something
in her appearance that gave one this
impression—as if the urgency of her
errand had been such, that it mat
tered not what she wore.
To those who lived on the stately
street, in which the woman turned
by her own volition, and the ready
assistance of the wind—and which,
on account of the magnificence of its
homes, had been dubbed “The Mil
lionaire’s Row”—if asked to define
the passionate bursts of rain, would
doubtless have referred to it, in the
poetical terms, that the “rain was
falling with satanic fury,” which is
hardly as expressive, but means the
same, in “the long run.”
In the handsomest of these homes,
there sat ensconced in a richly bro
caded red chair, which seemed to
threaten to almost envelop her slen
der figure, a woman, sombrely robed
in black, her hands tightly clenched
—staring straight ahead of her, and
yet not heeding the metallic cries of
breaking twigs the wind was so fiend
ishly crushing, and as carelessly
throwing to the brown earth. She
was thinking, thinking endlessly,
with no relief from her thoughts.
The great, richly furnished room
glowed in the firelight, giving every
evidence of an exquisite refinement,
and unlimited means to gratify this
taste for the luxurious. There were
flowers —great vivid poinsettas and
scarlet roses in oddly shaped brass
bowls, on the quaintly carved ma
hogany tables, whose polished sur
faces gleamed brightly in the danc
ing light of the fire. The only in
congruity seemed a baseball glove—
yes, a baseball glove, and a scarred
bat, which lay on one of the richly
brocaded chairs by the open piano,
and a boy’s red cap, as if they had
been hurriedly thrown there in boy
ish impetuous fashion—and they
had.
Was it a week or a year ago? the
woman by the window wondered,
when the dark haired, eager dark
eyed little boy had, that Saturday
morning, rushed in from play, to ask
permission to make a visit to some
little friend near by, and hearing the
inspiring strains of a brass band at
the corner, irrespective of being an
inmate of the most aristocratic man
sion in the “Row,” he had hastily
thrown hat, cap and ball-glove on
the seat near where she —his moth
er —was sitting, at the piano, look
ing over, and turning various bits of
new music, and rushed boylike to the
corner. Did I say to the corner. For
an empty carriage borne by two
frightened horses, came madly, fran
tically down the broad street, just as
the band was playing “Dixie,” and
the lad —loyal little son of the South
—loved this far best of any music.
And on, and on came the trembling,
snorting horses, and too late, the ea
ger little “Dixie” enthusiast, cross
ing the street, made for an escape.
There was none—but that of death,
which happily came later in the day,
and carried him smilingly away, and,
crushed and in bitter agony as he
lay, he had said “Now don’t fret
Mumsie .... and thank the
kind woman,” and then —
“The kind woman,” some one who
saw the accident, had told them, was
a washerwoman, a dark eyed, thin,
stoop-shouldered woman, who had
hastily put her basket down, and ran
in front of the horses and stopped
them —but too late. At a risk of her
own life, they had said. And she had
knelt by the little boy, and soothed
and petted him, until the great doc
tor had come, and lifted him tender
ly—he and the lad’s father, to his
own home. The woman had quietly
slipped away, but some one had said
that her name was Rosalie Priest.
But the woman who had known her,
had too moved on in the throng gath
ered at the corner, and no one had
been able to find the washerwoman,
to thank her for trying to save the
boy, or, the woman who knew her.
Dear little lad! It was fiercely
raining down there under the mag
nolia trees where he lay asleep . . .
from a wee child he had been afraid
of a storm, which fact he had often
bemoaned as unworthy of a boy of
seven . . . And yet, he had always
come to her, and put the quaint stool
of embroidered chintz that his grand
mother had worked, off at boarding
school, quite close to her, all during
the storms of summer, and would
cuddle quite close to her with his
little dark haired head buried in her
lap. And he was pitifully alone now
in the storm, and she, too, was alone.
He had told her “not to fret.” ....
Wearily she arose and turned on a
flood of light, for it was growing
some darker. She went back to the
window and glanced listlessly out.
From the slight eminence on which
her home stood, she could overlook
the entire square. It was then she
espied the woman, being so rudely
blown along at the mercy of the
storm. What was she doing out on
such a wild day as this? A beggar
probably. But most of the beggars
went in at the back to the residences
to the servant’s quarters. Into the
door of one house she went, rang,
and —then quickly out. Into anoth
er, and the door—the massive front
door, was opened by a man servant,
and shut again in a moment. The
rain had died down to a weird mono
tone, that had a bitter metallic ring
about it, as if it had forgotten the
soothing cadence it sings some days
so sweetly.
The last house the woman entered
the walk irresolutely and very soon
wearily came down this same walk;
she seemed to totter as if she were
'3cffar*onian
going to fall, but—she leaned for a
moment against the granite wall en
circling the grounds, and passed on.
By this time the woman at the
window was alertly, intently inter
ested. She watched eagerly for her
to reappear, but she did not. List
lessly she sat down again, but this
time by the fire, and again took up
the burden of her thoughts.
A keen vibrant ring at the front
door startled her. Then she heaard
the clear voice of Thomas, the butler.
“My mistress never gives money
any more. She’s that soft hearted,
that everybody imposed on her. But
—you can step around to the back
entrance and the cook, or one of the
maids, will give you something to
eat. They have their orders to do
that very thing. We don’t turn any
body away hungry,” he said boast
ingly.
“No, you can’t see her ....
She’s had a lot of trouble,” posi
tively.
“If she’d had trouble—don’t both
er her,” she heard the woman say,
but not in the whining tones of the
professional beggar, but, as if there
would never again be aught in her
life but rain, and hopelessness, and
utter weariness. “Eat! ” she had
cried, “it’d choke me ... I
could ’ave worked out’n the money
a washin’ for her. I guess I’ll be
movin’ back, I live a fur piece,” she
had added hopelessly.
The woman by the fire had risen,
and moved irresolutely toward the
door of the library which was par
tially concealed by heavily embroid
ered red silk curtains. She pushed
these back ’a little. Should she help
the woman? So many had taken ad
vantage of her kindness of heart
suppose she, too —this wo
man—at the door, was worthless.
Just then she heard Thomas say to
the woman, it was utterly unlike
him, as careful training as he had
had —with undeniable curiosity in
his voice, “Would you mind telling
me your name, an’ what you wanted
with just forty cents —I think that’s
what you wished me to ask my mis
tress for. It seems such a little to
beg for.”
“No,” replied the woman very
slowly—and with utter indifference
to his rudeness, for which he should
answer, the slender figure behind the
partially parted curtains determined
—the usually silent, inscrutable au
tomatic Thomas—was it curiosity or
was he stirred with pity. “No, I do
not mind,” she repeated, “it’s just
this, I ain’t got to work as much as
common this week, my baby’s been
sick. Yesterday the officers took my
husband back where we come from,
for a retailing liquor without license
—he’s awful good to me an’ the chil
dren—there ain’t but two now—the
baby died today. Yes —the baby—
died today—,” she added, with a de
spairing bitterness in her slow voice,
and as if she was trying to convince
herself, that this wretched, horrible
thing was really true. “And—” but
she paused.
The woman behind the silent cur
tains had stepped outside into the
hall, her great dark eyes were full of
tears. The light shone from the li-

brary full in the woman’s face at the
door. It was the face of the woman
whom she had seen come around the
corner. But the woman at the front
door was staring straight ahead of
her —seemingly into space—and did
not see her.
“And” —she, the woman outside
the front door, on the rainy porch,
began again, “I wanted the forty
cents,” she said simply, “to —finish—
payin’ —for my baby’s cof
fin. Tell your mistress my name’s
Rosalie Priest.”
She turned abruptly and started
off the porch, but for a moment
paused. She seemed ten years older.
The woman in the hall had not
heard the other woman. Like one in a
dream she had stood, with aching
heart . . . she had thought her’s
was a bitter burden! But now—
“ Call her back, Thomas!” she
cried authoritatively. “Hurry!” she
said, as the stolid Thomas hearing
this familiar voice of command, had
become the stately, solemn perfunc
tory butler, as became one in so high
a position, as to be butler in the
richest family on “Millionaire Row”
—and was moving slowly toward the
porch.
“Hurry, I tell you!” impatiently.
There were tears in the woman’s
voice and eyes. “Bring her back—l
want to help her, to love her, —to
comfort her,” she had added to her
self.
She was peering out the doorway,
where Thomas stood on the top step
of the broad steps which led out on
the terraces.
She brushed by him impatiently,
and out into the rain, in her thin
slippers, and black gown of sheer,
soft stuff, she ran, crying hopefully,
and yet pitifully, “Come back—
please! Woman—you—must—come
back!” She entreated. But only the
wind mocked her sweet voice, and no
answer came, save the constant drip
drop of the rain from the tall trees,
and the wind’s hoarse cries.
Groping in the darkness —for night
had suddenly descended —and weird
fantastic shadows the mist had made
of the familiar shrubs, she made her
way back to the house where she saw
her husband coming hastily down
the broad steps of the piazza. He
picked her up—she was but a slight
burden for one so broad shouldered
and stalwart —and carried her into
the hall. By the broad, generous of
width open fireplace, in which mer
rily blazed a huge log, he put her
gently down in an easy chair, and
knelt beside her, taking off her little
thin slippers. Thomas had told him
of the beggar.
The housekeeper, and maids, all—
came to see if she needed anything.
They one and all adored her, and
with her weak throat to go out on a
night like this—it was terrible. And
for a beggar!
She turned to the housekeeper,
and said, “Will you please ask Thom
as what the woman said her name
was—l did not quite catch it—we
might be able to find her,” wistfully.
“He says,” she said in answer,
with deferential tones, “it was Rosa-
