DEMOCRATS
VICTORIOUS
By a Large Majority-The
Whole Ticket Elected.
A Signal Victory Over the
Allied Forces of the
Combine.
An Ingenious Trick Re
sorted to,. But to no
Avail.
The Gazette's gay chanticleer ap
pears this morning under very auspi
cious circumstances. The recent
victory of the Democratic party
has stirred this feathery songster
and he begs to offer his earnest
congratulations to the unterrified
Democracy of the town. It has not
been the custom of The Gazette to
call upon this faithful bird to cele
brate victories of a local character,
but last Monday's election proved
such a manificent victory that the
jollification would have been an in
complete and a tame affair without
his elegant form and lusty voice.
He is a good-natured chicken and
though his.personal appearance is
not calculated to soothe the bleed
ing hearts of defeated candidates
and assuage the wounds of political
disappointment, he means no harm,
but is simply exercising his constitu
tional right to crow.
The election was hotly contested
and the supporters of both tickets
worked hard from the early hours
of the morning until the closing of
the polls at 6 o'clock. A full vote
was cast, 346 men having voted.
Everything passed off quietly and
no disturbance of any kind took
place. The Australian ballot law
worked well, every voter being
- given an opportunity to prepare his
ballot and vote it unhindered by
the obnoxious ward bosses whose
presence at the polls under the old
law made elections such disgrace
ful affairs,
The ballot box was placed in
the court-room and officers were
stationed near the entrance to allow
only two voters to go in and vote
at the same time. As soon as these
two had voted, two more were ad
mnitted, and in this manner all who
applied were given an apportunity
to exercise their right of sufrage.
During the early part of the day
the supporters of the People's
ticket were not very conspicuous
around the polls, the presumption
being that they were tenderly nurs
ing some formidable coup d'etat
wic'h 'was in process of incubation.
ut whether or not this was
true, has not been definitely ascer
tained.
The box,was opened at 7 o'clock.
The following gentlemen were the
commissioners: J. Alf. Mouton,
D. J. Veazey, F. C. Triay, and
Baxter. Clegg served as clerk.
Judge McFaddin was appointed
watcher for the Democrats and Ed
yard Judice for the People's ticket.
The voting was done without any
friction and all went on merrily
and smoothly. When the hour ar
rived to close the box two addi
tional watchers from each side were
appointed to witness the count.
Paul Castel and Robt. Bailey
served for the People's ticket and
Alfred Hebert and C. M. Parker
son represented the Caffery ticket.
Out of the 346 ballots 70 were
thrown out as "*spoilt." Some of
them bore marks written by lead
pencils. In many instances ballots
were nullified by the failure of the
voter to properly use the blotting
paper. One People's ticket had
been written on blank paper. This
fact has given rise to the belief in
the minds of some people that this
was a trick of the opposition to se
cure a genuine ticket. If it be true
ft-was a very ingenious trick, be
cause with one ticket they could
very easily have voted all their men
who could not read.
By preparing the first ticket, giv
ing it to one voter, who would be
trained to put the unprepared
ticket in his pocket and voting the
one that had been fixed for him.
The ticket thus secured could have
been given to a second voter and
by repeating this procedure any
number of illiterate men could have
been voted.
The commissioners began count
ing at about 7:3o and announced
the result at x r o'clock. The vote
stood as follows:

THE MOTHER
Of Ernest and Alexis Blanc
Writes to Know if '
Her Sons
Were Really Guilty and In
What Manner They
Died.
It will be remembered that the
Blanc brothers, who were executed
here on April 2, always contended
that their mother was dead and that
they had not a relative on earth.
In his written confession Ernest
Blanc pays a beautiful tribute to
the memory of his mother, and de
picts in eloquent language the scene
which he alleges took place in
Paris some years ago when he and
his brother, Alexis, ministered to
the last wants of their mother who
expired in their arms after a painful
and lingering illness. Those who
read the confession written by
Alexis may remember that passage
where the younger brother says:
"Poor mother I How she must
have suffered, if from her heavenly
abode, she looked down upon us
and followed us through our lives !"
To a New Orleans reporter the
brothers stated that after commit
ting the crime they had left for
France to visit the grave of their
mother and with their ill-gotten
money they intended to buy a
tomb-stone to place upon the rest
ing place of their beloved parent.
As these statements and confes
sions were made by the young men
when an awful death on the gallows
was a certainty few doubted their
story, especially that part of it con
cerning their mother, but the fal
lowing letter received Thursday
morning by Rev. E. Forge, goes to
show that there is no credence to
be placed in what the youthful
murderers wrote and said. The
letter, which explains itself, reads:
"NEW YORK, May 2, 1897.
"'Reverend Sir-Permit me to
ask of you the details relative to
the death of two young men, Ernest
and Alexis Blanc, who, it appears,
were executed in your parish in ex
piation of a crime committed by
them. It is the mother of the two
young men who requests me to
write to ascertain if her sons were
really guilty, and under what cir
cumstances, and in what spiritual
condition they died.
"Thanking you in advance, be
lieve me, etc.
'"THEO. WUCHER,
"Priest of St. Vincent de Paul,
'120 V. 24th street, New York."
The letter which was written in
French, is undoubtedly authentic.
Rev. E. Forge has replied to it,
giving the desired information.
Call up phone 71 when you wish
to speak to Mouton & Hopkins.
The Ladies' Club Meet.
On Thursday the Ladies' Club
held their weekly meeting with the
charming Mrs. Franklin Mouton as
hostess, assisted by Mrs. Walter
Mouton.
After the business part of the
programme had been dispensed
with, the merry company repaired
to the dining room where nuts,
cake and dainty ices formed the
tempting menu. Later in the after
noon Miss Young favored the mem
bers with a pretty song, well ren
dered and Mrs. Chas. Caffery read
in her inimitable manner an amus
ing poem entitled "The New
Church Organ" A novel featuie of
entertainment was then .enjoyed
"Dressing The New Woman".
This procedure caused much mer
riment. After animated discussion
the prizes were finally awarded to
Mrs. A. Bonnet and Mrs. E. Tra
han.
At the close of a very enjoyable
meeting the members bade each
other "*au revoir but not good-bye",
for on Saturday they would again
meet at a picnic given by their
club. But more anon about this
latter event.
If you need any printed station
ery, we would like to furnish you
with some of it.
ASSESSMENTS
Of Railroad, Telegraph and Tele
phone -Lines.
As Usual the Railroad Compalnes
Pare Well.
The board of assessors ofr tele
graph railroad and telephone lines
for this district of the State met at
the court-house in Lafayette at 2
o'clock Thursday last.
Hon. C. C. Brown was made
temporary chairman and W. D.
Haas secretary.
The following gentlemen were
sworn in by Chas. D. Caffery, Esq.,
as members of the board:
W. D. Haas, Avoyelles; Dr. B.
E. Clark, Acadia;. Jos. Lebleu,
Calcasieu; J. A. Provost, Iberia;
H. Marrero, Jefferson; C. C.
Brown, Lafayette; H. N. Coulon,
Lafourche; J. C. Price, Rapides;
Sam Haas, St. Landry; A. E. Pi
card, St. Charles; E. A. Duchamp,
St. Martin; W. P. Miller, Vermil
ion; A. F. Davidson, Terrebonne.
Assumption and St. Mary were not
represented.
There were present E. Van Vleck,
general manager; T. Fay, manager's
assistant; W. F. Owens and Judge
J. G. Parkerson, of the Southern
Pacific Company; E. M. West,
manager New Orleans office of
the Western Union Company; J.
T. Fowler, Manager Great
Southern Telephone Company; R.
F. Hogsett, manager Teche and
Vermilion Telephone Company.
These gentlemen were present to
look after the interests of their
respective companies.
The temporary organization was
made permanent on the motion
of Mr. Marrero. Upon the motion
of Mr. Marrero the assessment of
the Southern Pacific's property was
taken up.
On motion of Mr. Coulon,
seconded by Mr. Provost, the as
sesment of the Southern Pacific's
main road from Alexandria to New
Orleans was placed at the same
figures as last year-$65oo.
Messrs. Davidson and Duchamp
argued that every branch road
should be assessed separately, and
Mr. Coulon of Lafourche claimed
that it was the duty of the whole
board to assess all the branches at
the same time. That the intention
of the law is to equalize the assess
ments.
Mr. Marrero's motion to assess
all branches together was carried.
Upon motion of Mr. Marrero all
branches of the Southern Pacific
were assessed at $3500.
Telegraph lines of the Western
Union were assessed at the same
figures as last year, $ioo per mile
for two wires with $ia for each ad
ditional wire.
The property of the Great South
ern Company was fixed the same as
formerly, $30 per mile. The local
ized portion in Calcasieu was. ex
cepted.
The Teche and Vermilion tele
phone line was assessed at $x5 a
mile.
The Teche Railroad was as
sessed at $1750.
The Louisiana Western's line
from Lafayette to Calcasieu was
taken up. The main line was as
sessed at $6500 and the Eunice
branch at $3,500. This is a reduc
tion from last year's assessment of
$5oo per mile.
When the Iberia and Vermilion
railway f*as reached, considerable
time was consumed, as the two
commissioners, Messrs. Provosi
and Miller, representing the parishes
traversed by this road, failed to ar
rive at a conclusion. Mr. Provost,
of Iberia, wanted to let the assess
ment remain at $3,500oo per mile,
while Mr. Miller, of Vermilion, in
sisted 'that $;,ooo was a fair and
proper valuation. Owing to the
failure of Commissioners Provosi
and Miller to agree, no assessmenl
was fixed on this road. The repre.
sentstives of the railroad claimed
that as no assessment was fixed the
figures will remain the same as
heretofore. Mr. Miller, however,
did not concur "this opinion.
Mr. Davidsoi, of Terrebonne,
made a strenuous kick because he
considered ftt $3,5oo on
Houma branceW was too low. t
the railroad company held a pat
hand and Mr. Davidson's protesta
tions were to no avail.
A PICNIC
Will Be Given by the Veterans of
The Local Camp.
At,.a meeting of Camp Frank
Gardner last Saturday, the United
Confederate Veterans decided to
give a grand picnic at Reausejour
Park, Saturday, May 22. A com
mittee of three was appointed to
arrange for the event, and secure
orators for the day. It is the pur
pose of the veterans to make the
occasion a most enjoyable one,
socially and intellectually. Elo
quent addresses will be made by
distinguished speakers in French
and English, interspersed with
music and songs. A cordial invi
tation is extended all who feel an
interest in the battle-scarred vet
erans, who sacrificed their all for
the principles of right and justice
involved in the Lost Cause. Their
ranks are now thin, and ere long,
the heroes of that gigantic struggle,
with such fearful odds against thenm,
will live but in memory; their
deeds of valor, emblazoned on the
pages of history, and the eternal
principles for which they fought,
engraven upon the hearts of .all
future generations, to be cherished
as a proud heritage.
Let the good people of our town
and parish, therefore, join heartily
in an endeavor to do honor to these
few living representatives of the
Lost Cause, and make the reunion
one of unalloyed pleasure and en
joyment. The ladies and children
are especially invited to lend in
spiration to the patriotic demon
stration.
An old gray-haired veteran, last
Saturday, in an earnest and elo
quent conversation, remarked:
"Had it not been for the ladies,
the Confederacy would have
crumbled and sunk into oblivion at
the end of its first year's existence."
Who will dare gainsay this glorious
tribute to the heroism of the noble
Southern womanhood, a heroism
that shall forever immortalize the
fair sex of our beloved Southland ?
Let the ladies pack those baskets
full of every delicacy, and above
all, lend their presence to grace
and cheer the festivities of the day.
AT SCOTT
News Items Picked Up by the Gazette
Correspondent.
Mr. Chas. Doane and his car
penter brigade was here last week,
and put the Southern Pacific depot
in "bran new shape." The
painters will be here in a few days,
and Scott can brag of a beautiful
depot.
Mr. Octave Guilbeau, one of our
old-time friends, was a pleasant
visitor in Scott last Tuesday. Oc
tave looks as lively as ever.
Mr. J. J. Price's large store is
complete and filled with goods.
He is selling at rock bottom prices.
All that is necessary now to pre
vent cobwebs from accumulating
around his doors is a good size ad
vertisement in The Gazette.
The ball last Saturday was
crowded as usual. The Broussard
Band discoursed sweet music, and
the gay dancers enjoyed themselves
till the wee small hours of the
morning.
Several of our folks have been
under the weather of late caused by
bad colds. We presume that the
dust is generally the cause, and this
could be stopped with a street
sprinkler.
Posters are out announcing a
meeting on Sunday, May 9, to
further devise means for the build
ing of a church. Let the good
work go on.
Mr. Doacet is rapidly pushing
work on his mansion on North
Avenue. And the music of the
hammer and saw is heard on all
sides.
The surveyor, Mr. lFrancez, of
Carencro, was in town doing some
work last Tuesday.
Several of the Scott folk attended
the first communion at Ra) ne last
Wednesday. Master Geo. Budro
passed a successful examination
and made his first communion and
retuibed home a good Christian.
There will be big races near
Scott on the 23d of May, which
will be on a Sunday. It seems that
Christian folk ought to find another
lay for races instead of Sunday,
which is the Lord's day.
We are theaterless, streetcarless,
libraryless, streetwalkless, but Scott
is growing right along, and no one
complains of hard times. In a few
months we will have Catherine
Cole side-walks and a Times-Demo
crat reading room. All this has
been discussed and will soon ma
terialize.
ORTON.
Who Said They Should Not
Be Paid.
To The Lafayette Gazette.
In your valued paper of May r,
appears an article headed
"Teachers Should by Paid" com
menting on the non-action of the
School Board in regards to paying
the teachers "requested" to attend
the institute. It is true that at the
last meeting of the board that body
omitted to order the superintendent
to pay the theachers, but not
through malice or meanness. It
was only an oversight, for we all
know that there is a State law pro
viding for the payment of teachers
while attending institutes and in
the service of the board. If our
"'faithful and conscientious
teachers" understood this omission
as a flat refusal to pay,they have mis
concieved the intention, or at least
that of the majority. It is to be hoped,
though, they will forgive us our sin
of omission, as well as accept our
act of commission in turning over
all our per diem to the teachers'
funds. It is not much, but every
little bit helps. Now, our "faithful
and conscientious teachers" should
be fully in line and be patriotic
and charitable enough not to exact
full pay for their attendance at the
institutes, as "requested," for they
understand that those institutes are
held absolutely for their advance
ment as well as for their benefit,
though the public reaps the over
flow of their advanced methods of
teaching.
Hoping that "faith and con
science" intermingled with patriot
ism and charity overflow the hearts
of our teachers in such abundance
as to permit them to meet us Satur
day and come to a reasonable
agreement: Say about half pay if
conscience is 'cot too strictly busi
ness first and charity last.
Our teachers must be aware that
there are certain sections of our
parish which have not .been pro
vided for, where the people are
begging and clamoring for schools,
which they should have by all
means---and unless we receive as
sistance from one source or another
we are powerless and cannot assist
them, to say nothing of the outside
teachers begging for employment
which would be a pleasure to give
to them.
A IEMaIER OF THE BOARD.
ENTERTAINED
By the Catholic Knights of Amer
lea of Lafayette.
The Catholic Knights of America
entertained a large number of peo
ple at Falk's Opera House last
