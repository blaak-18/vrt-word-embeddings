SrrTAc.--The Scientitie American
says: Sunmac is larg&tly used in tan
iiing the li:er kinds of leather, es
pecially in the imaniufac'tnre of hard
giainedl n:orocce and similar goods. '. S.
It is also bnrployed as the base of ma
ny colors in calico and delaine print
ing. Probably the consuulption of am
this artiCle throughout the country
for all rurposies agg rgateR more than
120,(tEO tons, of which shaout two-thirds
arw imn!oiorted fro m Sicily, not because
ijust as good sumac can not be grown
in this couutay, but becarse, until a pF
few yearsw ago, our people did not nde
know its value, or in what way to Rout
prepare it for the market. The an- Alad
mac ot Virginia, Maryland and Ten- tey,
;, nessee in particular are said to be the IL4i
Ibest in tihe world, and even their be:n;
worst varieties have bean oficially a3y,
Sp.ronounced 'oy experts to be balter ters
than any imlorted froml Sicily. Al- chit
most every farmer has a clump of an
these butlhes. They are called by ther
.some 'ehocmaike;" by others, "led 'I
shoe;:take." Probably many farmers they
may have tried to kill them by cut- 5, oI
ting down. If they have, they know Nett
howv d.:i.cult a task it is. It grows Jam
like asýarag:s, all the better for be- (
iii cut; aund when once started upon and
a lot and cut oice a v'ear, it is as easy 'P
to cut as fodder. Th;e only trouble is hein
in curing it properly. This imiust be use
tlone with all the care that is given to and
tobacco or hops. Exposure, after I) t
cutting, to a heavy dew, inljures it, of
au'd a rain-storm d&traict materially T
(rout its value. It is cut when in full 5 w
leaf, and when properly dried is and
ground, leaves and stalks together. pert
An acre in full hearing will produce ,4,
not les than three tons, and when cur
fit for market it is wortlh from $80 to the
jl10 per ton. The "manuflacturers," Il t
us the carers are called, pay about per!
one cent a pound for it in a green qua
state. A sumac-mill coats about of
$,3,000.
W rAT is MANcnu t-Any thing
which, upon being applied to the soil,
causeo it to produce a more abundant
crop, is manure. Manure is of three
kinds--natural, mental and mechani
cal. Natural manjure is anything
which, iteing decomposed, assists the
earth to s6pport pl;at life. It was
nature's origital agent' in preparing
the barren waste, which our earth 8
formerly was, as a fitting abode for in 1
mat'. The progress of decay and bi
'death in the taulitial awtd vegetable
kiilgdoumi is the only manole of creat
ing natural manure. The final dea
tiny of all aniomal and vegetable life
is to be transformed to natural nma
nure. This is the begillniug as well
as the sending of all earthly things. U
Mental manure is bIrains--ºot the JI
animal composite which we call our
brains, but the active, creative prin- l
ciple, which is the guiding power of Ji
main, and wlhich, when applied to the
operations of farming. produce the W
third kind of manure, the mnechani- by
cal. Mechanical manaure is the result th
of brains applied to rural affairs. r
Mechanical mteasures are of more real I
va'ne to tihe farmer than either or
both of the other two. Mechanical a
measures con u st of plows, harrows,
cultivators, rollers, spades, shovels, ar
rakes, &c., id oneces. If the farmer re
Sbhooks oi to the meclhanical manures
guides tihem by a thorough applica
ti,:n of the mental llIultl'O,,. and stirs
up the inatural nianulre, he farms un
rin drstandmigly, lie loosens up the soil, N
the life-giving atnuaphere enters in,
La heat and moistlire, in contradietinc
tion to cold and wet, pervade tue
earth, niture asserts her prerogative,
seeds find themselves in a congeial
element, the growing crop feels the
Smg treble imjulse, matures, and comes dc
I al to hIarvest abundantly.
h. All these, manures are dependent o
, upon one another. It is Efirst neces
sary to cover the earth with the nat
- lurall;.then tile mental comprehends
the necessities of the ease, and ap
plies itself to thle good work, and,
calling in the aid of her oldest son,
I the mechanical, so manipulates oar
'omother earth that smiles spread over
her whole face, finually bursting into a
laugh of golden joy, which ringls
r., through all the happy harvest.
"And thus may we three meet again,
Whene'er we sow oaut fields to grain."
To Bake a Beefs Heart.-CCut it

it soak an hour in lukewarm water,

secure it with a string. Let it bake
