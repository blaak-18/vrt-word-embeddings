vince good Christian people of an
error of judgment in some part of
their religious faith?
There is no question, in my mind,
but what a great number of foreign
mission believers get a world of
solace and comfort out of their faith
and contribution, and to shatter their
ideals seems wicked; however, isn’t
it a duty we owe ourselves, the pub
lic and posterity to express our
honest convictions on all great pub
lic questions?
Suppose we are in error, and the
foreign mission believer be correct,
do we not do more harm in fighting
an innocent evil than the believer
does in practicing it? What is the
line of duty of a church communi
cant who is opposed to foreign mis
sions?
I have, for a number of years,
considered you the greatest mental
force in public life since the Recon
struction period and I have an abid
ing faith in your honesty of purpose,
but have at some times doubted your
good judgment.
You may publish this letter, to
gether with your reply, and I will
thank you for so doing.
Very cordially yours,
THOS. L. HILL.

Ed. Comment: We naturally in
cline to believe,
(1) What everybody says;
(2) What some are constantly
saying, and nobody denying.
God made us just that way. Now,
the ministers of the Gospel have for
years been preaching Foreign Mis
sions, until nearly everybody has
“got it on the brain.” Ages ago,
when some wiseacre announced that
the earth is round, people were pain
fully shocked. So much so, indeed,
that they rose up in wrath and did
hasty and rude things to the round
earth crank.
So, also, with reference to the evo
lution of the earth. Galileo, as you
have no doubt heard once or twice,
was cast into prison by our Catholic
Papa’s pets, and grievously tortured
because of his heretical discovery of
orthodox facts.
As there will be further discussion
of Foreign Missions in the editorial
pages, I will restrain myself from
extended remarks here. —T. E. W.
REV. THAD. PICKETT’S DEATH
AND FUNERAL.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I write you to
tell you of the sad death of Mr. T.
Pickett. He died August the 6th at a
private sanatorium in Atlanta, after
an operation. Mr. Pickett was de
voted to you, was a great lover of
your paper, and we all knew him to
be one of the best Christian gentle
men North Georgia has ever had.
He was our neighbor and brother..
He was like a father to me, and
when he bade us all good-bye he
begged us to meet him in heaven.
Mr. Pickett was buried Sunday, at
2 p. m., at Talking Rock, Ga. There
were nearly two thousand people at
his funeral at his old home church.
Mr. Pickett leaves a wife and eight
dear children to mourn his loss.
Last night, just one week from his
death, his little daughter fell in the
arms of Jesus. She was converted
here at the Baptist church under the
preaching of Bro. Goss, from Atlanta.
His noble son, Mr. Roscoe Pickett,
'Jeffersonian
I feel like will try to take his father’s
place by taking care of his dear
mother and the younger members of
thq family.
Write to them, Mr. Watson, it will
do them good.
I am yours very respectfully,
MRS. EMMA A. COX.
Ball Ground, Ga., August 14, 1909.
TRIBUTE TO THAD. PICKETT.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson:—l have
just read the sad news in The Jef
fersonian of the death of Rev. Thad.
Pickett, a man, perhaps, of the most
native ability Georgia had. A man
for whom I had the very highest es
teem; a man fearlessand who had the
courage of his convictions under any
and all circumstances, a brother
whom I loved with all the ardor of
my nature; he was truly a great man.
The Populists have lost one of its
ablest and most*fearless advocates. A
man remarkable for his integrity of
purpose, one of the best informed
men in the Scriptures I ever met, it
will be hard to find a man to fill his
place.
I greatly sympathize with Mrs.
Pickett and the children in their sad
bereavement.
From a true and devoted friend.

JEFFERSONIAN CLUBS
Parties wishing to organize Jeffer
sonian Clubs are requested to send in
their names at once to The Jefferson
ians, Thomson, Ga.
As soon as organizers have obtain
ed enough names on their lists, the
best thing to do is to organize the
club, elect officers, lay out a program,
get the news in the local papers, and
make each member a home mission
ary to preach and teach, and to se
cure as many new members as possi
ble.
The principal points in the forma
tion of a club are these:
CONDITIONS OF MEMBERSHIP:
(1) White parentage. (2) Pay
ment of one dollar a year. (3)
Pledge to work actively for reforms
of all kinds social, civic, State and
National. (4) Pledge to support
the State and National platforms,
after said platforms have been
voted upon by all clubs, and after
adoption by the State League and
by the National League of Jeffer
sonian Clubs.
OFFICERS: President, Vice-Presi
dent, Secretary and Treasurer, to
be elected each year.
OFFICIAL ORGAN: The Jefferson
ian. Each member shall be enti
tled to receive the paper free.
LOCAL ORGAN: Get a local news
paper interested in the work, or
start a new reform paper.
REPORTS: Complete reports of the
I agree to become a member of a Jeffersonian Club as soon as or
‘ ganized in my neighborhood.
I pledge myself to take up and carry on active work of reform, so
cial, civic, state and national, in whatever direction may be decided upon
by the members of this Club, and by such state and national organiza
tions as may be formed by the union of Jeffersonian Clubs.
I agree to pay the Club dues of one dollar a year, which shall be

COCA-COLA AND FOREIGN MIS
SIONARIES.
Glad to see the pages on Coca-
Cola. I have been wondering for
years if some bold knight, unsubsi
dized, would not at last tackle this
soul and body destroying dope that
is ruining our Southern girls and
boys and filling the asylums. Best of
all, however, is the showing up of
the missionary delusion. Thirty-two
years ago I was in New Zealand dur
ing a time of great trouble with the
natives, and we arranged for a great
pow-wow to consider the troubles be
tween the races. I well remember
one of the most powerful chiefs clos
ing up the meeting by telling us that
the missionaries were at the bottom
of all the trouble, for, he said, “They
caused us to look up to heaven with
our eyes, while they stole away the
land from under our feet.”
Success to The Jeffersonian and all
Truth tellers.
Yours truly,
ROBERT RANSON.

(This about New Zealand is a his
torical fact. Tolstoy wrote one of
his most powerful articles on it. The
Hawaiian islanders lost their lands
the same way. Likewise the Filipi
nos. Also the Fiji Islanders. —T. E.
W.)
Join a Jeffersonian Club and go to
work.
Get ten pieces of music, worth 25
cents each, absolutely free, by doing
a little work for us.
work of each club shall be pub
lished at least four times a year.
BUTTONS: Each member shall wear
a button or badge, which will be
supplied by the State or National
organization.
EDUCATION: This is the principal
object of the clubs. Reading
rooms, libraries, lectures and en
tertainments should be provided,
and each club should be made a
center of educational influence.
LADIES will use their good influence
to help the reform movement on
ward, and to give the clubs a social
life.
WORK! WORK! ! WORK! ! ! Each
club, and each member of a club,
shall work actively and continuous
ly for the election of State legisla
tors who are known to be in sym
pathy with the reform movement,
and especially for Representatives
from Congressional districts who
can be depended upon to support
the National Platform adopted by
the National League of Jefferson
ian Clubs.
All who desire to join a Jefferson
ian Club will kindly sign the follow
ing pledge, and also state if they are
willing to undertake the work of or
ganization. If not, who is the best
organizer in the neighborhood? Give
his name and address. Write plainly.
Cut this out, place it in an envelope,
and mail to The Jeffersonians, Thom
son, Ga.
