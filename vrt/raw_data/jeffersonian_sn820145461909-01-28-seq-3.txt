The Old Times, Alexander Stephens, Etc.
Two cents —only two cents. When
I look at a postage-stamp it carries me
away back. Back to the time when
my father was postmaster and I was
clerk, and had to make up the mails in
a country town. The difference be
tween now and then shows that the
world’s progress in this department
is hardly excelled in any other branch
of improvement. We couldn’t bear
to be set back again in the old ways
that our fathers thought were pretty
good. There were no stamps no en
velopes and no mucilage. The paper
was folded up like a thumbpaper, and
one side slipped in the other and seal
ed with a wrapper. The little school
boys, you know, had to use thumb
papers in their spelling books to keep
them clean where their dirty thumbs
kept the pages open. Girls didn’t
have to use any, for they were nicer
and kept their hands clean, and didn’t
wear out the leaves by the friction
of their fingers. Boys are rough
things anyhow, and I don’t see what
a nice, sweet, pretty girl wants with
one of ’em. Girls they say are made
of sugar and spice and all that’s nice,
but boys are made of snaps and snails
and puppy dog’s tails. Josephus says,
that when the Queen of Sheba was
testing Solomon’s wisdom, she had
fifty boys and fifty girls all dressed
alike in girls’ clothes and seated
around a big room, and asked the king
to pick out the boys from the girls,
and he called for a basin of water and
had it carried around to each one and
told them to wash their hands. The
girls all rolled up their sleeves a little
bit, the boys just sloshed their hands
in any way and got water all over
their aprons, and so the king spotted
every mother’s son of ’em.
The postage used to be regulated by
the distance that Uncle Sam carried
the letters. It was 12 1-2 cents any
where in the State, and 18 3-4 cents
to 'Charleston, and 25 cents to New
York. It was never prepaid. A man
could afflict another with a pistareen
letter that wasn’t worth five cents. A
pistareen, you know, was 18 3-4 cents
—that is a sevenpence and a thrip.
We had no dimes or half-dimes. The
dollar was cut up into eighths instead
of tenths. When a countryman called
for letters and got one, he would look
at it some time and turn it over and
meditate before he paid for it, and
very often they would say, “Where
did this letter come from?” Well, I
would say for instance, “It came
from Dahlonega—don’t you see Dah
lonega written up on the corner?”
Then he would say, “Well, I reckon
it’s from Dick, my brother Dick. He
is up there diggin’ gold. Don’t you
reckon it’s from Dick?” “I reckon
it is,” said I. “Why don’t you open
it and see?” “No, I’ll wait until I
get home. They’ll all want to see it.”
When he got home that letter would
be an event in the family, -and per
haps it would take them a half an hour
to wade through it and make out its
contents. Nine out of ten of those
country letters began, “I take my
pen in hand to let you know that I am
well, and hope these few lines will
find you enjoying the same blessing.”
My father kept store and his country
customers used to ask him to write
their letters for him, and he always
sent them to me, and most of them
told me to begin their letters that
way. There was not more than one
in five could write, but they were
good, clever, honest people and paid
their debts, but they hardly ever paid
up in full at the end of the year, and
so they gave their notes for the bal
ance and made their mark. My father
used to say that he had known eases
where a man swore off his written
signature, but he never knew a man
to .deny his mark. Our big northern
mail used to come in a stage from
Madison twice a week, and I used to
think the sound of the stage horn as
the stage came over the hill was one
of the sublimest things in the world,
and I thought that if I ever got to
be a man I would be a stage-driver
if I could. Well, I came pretty near
it, for my father had hired a man
to ride the mail to Roswell and back
twice a week, and the man got sick
and so my father put me on a drome
dary of a horse and the mail in some
saddle bags behind me, and I had to
make the 48 miles in a day, and kept
it up all the winter. I like to have
frozen several times, and had to be
lifted off the horse when I got hoihe,
and it nearly broke my mother’s
heart, but I was getting a dollar a
trip and it was my money, and so I
wouldn’t back out. The old women on
the route used to crowd me with their
little commissions and get me to bring
them pepper, or copperas, or bluing,
or pins and needles, or get me to take
along some socks and sell them, and
so I made friends and acquaintances
all the way. The first trip I made, an
old woman hailed me and said, “Are
you a mail boy?” “Why, yes, mam,”
said I. “You didn’t think I was a
female boy, did you?” I thought that
was smart, but it wasent very civil
and it made her so mad she never
told me what she wanted, and as she
turned her back on me I heard her
say, “I’ll bet he is a little stuck up
town boy.”
My father was postmaster for near
ly thirty years. It didn’t pay more
than (about S2OO a year, but it made
his store more of a public place. He
dident know that anybody else han
kered after it or was trying to get it,
but all of a sudden he got his orders
to turn over the office to another man,
an old line Whig and a competitor in
business. It mortified him very much
and made us tall mad, for there was
no fault found with his management,
and he never took much interest in
politics, but voted for the man he
liked the best whether he was a Whig
or a Democrat. When he found that
Alex Stephens had it done he wasent
a -Stephens man any more, and I grew
up with an idea that Mr. Stephens
was a political fraud. I dident un
derstand the science of politics as
well as I do now. I told Mr. Steph
ens about it one night at Milledgeville
when we were all in a good humor and
were talking about the old times of
Whigs and Democrats, and he smiled
and said, “Yes, we had to do those
things and sometimes they were very
disagreeable.” I will never forget
that night’s talk. It was during the
session of the first legislature after
the war. Jim Waddell took me to
Mr. Stephens’ room to hear him talk,
and there was Mr. Jenkins and Tom
Hardeman and Benning Moore and
C>b® Jeffersonian
Beverly Thornton and Pete Strozier
and Dr. Ridley and some others, and
everybody was in a good humor, and
Mr. Stephens was reclining on his bed
and told anecdote after anecdote about
the* old Whigs and how he met the
Democrats on the stump, and what
they said and what he said, and he
most always got the advantage and
carried the crowd with him. I was
very much fascinated with his conver
sation, but couldent help being re
minded of a circumstance that trans
pired some years before in the town
of Calhoun. The Whigs of Gordon
county had sent for Mr. Stephens to
come up and make a speech and rally
the boys for the next election, for
Gordon was pretty equally balanced
between Whigs and Democrats, and
the Whig's wanted a big revival. So
Aleck accepted, and when the day
came the crowd was tremendous. The
Democrats had tried to get Howell
Cobb and Herschel Johnson to come
up and reply to Aleck, but they could
ent come, and so little Aleck had it
all his own w r ay. In the meantime the
Democratic boys had hunted up A. M.
Russell and got his promise to reply to
Mr. Stephens. Russell was an origi
nal genius. He was gifted in lan
guage, gifted in imagination, gifted
in cheek, gifted in lying, and was ut
terly regardless of consequences.
Mr. Stephens made a splendid
speech. He arraigned the Democracy
and held them up to ridicule, and
when he got through the Whigs were
more than satisfied, too —he came
down from the stand and was receiv
ing the congratulations of his friends,
when suddenly Russell mounted the
rostrum and, rapping on the plank in
front of him, screamed out one un
earthly yell: “Fellow citizens!”
Everybody knew him, and everybody
wanted to hear him, and hushed into
silence. After a sentence or two Mr.
Stephens was attracted to him, and
with curios and astonished interest, in
quired, “Who is that man?” After
Russell had paid an eloquent tribute
to the glorious old Democratic party,
and given it credit for every good
thing that had been done since the fall
of Adam, he then turned to Mr. Steph
ens, and, with a sneering scorn, said:
“And what have you and your party
been trying to do?—what made you
vote away the public lands so that
yankees and furriners could get ’em
and our people couldent? What made
you vote for high tariff on sugar and
coffee and raise the price so that our
poor people couldent buy it?” Mr.
Stephens rose excited and irritated,
and stretching his long arm to the
audience, screamed out: “I never did
it, my fellow citizens —I deny the fact
and call upon the gentleman for his
proof.” With the utmost self-posses
sion, Russell said, “You do —you call
for the proof. Sir, if I was to go two
miles from home to make a speech I
would carry my proof with me. I
wouldent be vain enough to go with
out it; but, sir, I am at home —these
people know me —they raised me and
when I assert a thing they believe it.
You are the man to bring the proof.”
The crowd shouted and laughed as
tumultuously as they had done for
Mr. Stephens, and he sat down dis
gusted. Russell continued: “And
what was your motive when you were
