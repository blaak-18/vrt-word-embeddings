C'nXTS at Usdicrk's BoaJrdig loues.
Louisiana and the Centennial.
We hear a good deal of sentiment is
Indalged in now-a-days, and read a
;resat deal more of it, about Lonisi
ana and the Centennial and the deep
regret of her not being represented
at that great Radical sidershow at
Philadelphia. We confess that "po
erry has fled our soul," and we can
see n'othing but trashy sentiment in
nil this display, andl the known rant
and hypocrisy of such leading (9)
American patriots (!) as attend that
concern, makes the whole thing to our
mind a piece of down right sacerilege
against liberty.
At Philadelphia, such people as
Grant, Garfield, Blame, Morton,
Conklin and others, preach Union and
brotherly love, and afterward, with
all these peace utterings warm on
their lips, they froth forth villainous
vituperation, denunciation and abuse
of the Southern people.
We love the Union, and are loyal
to its flag and traditions, but we can
eider it a public virtue to detest such
canting scoundrels as above named,
who, like ghouls, dish up the horrors
of the past, and riot among the graves
of honored dead, in order to ,arpetu
ate the power to rob a people they
preteind to love as brothers; to out
rage that liv y they psetend to ven
crate.
Perhaps this love and veneration
is "all hnmlbug;" perhaps the Imass
of men have grown too "smart" to be
actuated by those eold time noble
heart impulses. Perhaps patriotism
has "played out" in the essence, and
the mere forms are only olbserved.
They tell us that Csaar and the great
high priests lost, as they became
"smarter," (we believe that is the
Yankeeism for brains) their belief,
love and veneration, in, :and for the
Gods, and when they sacrificed, could
not look each other in the eye for
fear of laughing at their ridiculous
incantations. Perhaps we have reach
ed this point, and Grant and Gar
field only attend this saerifiee to lib.
erty, holding their sides and turning
eres to Heaven to keep "from laugh.
ing at the damned stuff."
We are proud that Lonisiana and
her onsa have nothing to do with this
fraud.
We have done all we could to show
the howling demagogues of the North
that we abide all results; that we
love the Union for its benefits, and
cherish its memories from pure pat
riotism; but to go up to such a feast
with such men as Garfield, Blaine,
Morton or Grant, is so totally repug
nant to our feelings and ideas, as to
make as sick at the mere thought of
it.
This centennial celebration is a
e eolnde by aling attention to
it.
Caresar's fall oin Rome was preceeded
by the burlesqued sacrifices to the
Gods, where lip spervices comported
but illy with the suppresod mirth of
the High Priestle.
Robespierre's doom was marked by
that strange Pete de F'r. BaSpreme,
or the deeree of the Deity, and the
Radical demagogues of the North
with their Centennial-may profit by
these examples.
Myers, as a pugilist is quite a suc
ese, and as to "taking things," he
still holds his own, for he took one of
the most solid cursings a human be
ing ever got, last Tuesday, adminis.
tered by a negro boy, who objected
to the ways that ar, dark, and tricks
that are (not) vain, with which hean
eat rif) Myers "does up" the school
business of this pariah.
The negro in question wra knoeked
dowa by Myers at first, which we
take, i a great thing-for Myers, con
sidering he was not in paint, but
after the blow, the negro withdrew to
Sthe stret and dared Myers to come
forth and he would "whip h-I outen
him in a minte"-thlia Myers very
prdently declinted to do, and the
colored eitizen thereupon said;
"that's the way wid you dam Radical
white mena; tell us you give us all
our rights and steal all our school
money."
That negro hoas been reading the
VuDowavon.
The Radical meeting on Tuesday
last was as stoupendous a failure ares
those which have preceded it.
Three hundred and fainety-four
-men and boys by actual count were
upoen the gronad and they were re
,pled by speeches from C. C. Antoine,
Ge. L. Smith, and others.
It certain y looks g1oomi.v for those
two frauds to see eteir parish, as tie
consolingly consider Natchitoches,
"go heck" on the bummers in such
style as that.
The fact is that Natehitoehes has
been taught a lesson in radicalism
that she will never torget, and Smith
as well as Antoine can never disabuse
the minds of the colored people even,
that eight per osut tfte, are any ev.
idenee of good and cheap governnent.
Ksit Smith and Antoine-and now
we'll see the turn out for Nicholls and

This word, whose fail meaning fl

repose to all trou!,led and distracted i
people, is upon the tongue of every
harpy and scoundrel that has madie
Lilwrty and Justice blush at their
very sight for ten years past.
The R:adical orators the other day,
"spoke peace." but argued precepts
and detined principles totally at va.
riance with their preaching. Kenne
dy "talked peace," but at the same
time, advised that all "Democratic

Does it not strike one as singular i
that Natehitoehes should have thrown
in her teeth this charge of violence,
when even Northern Radicals stand
in sinmple wonder at our patient en
dnranee of wrong and outr:age..
When all good men applaud these a

The Ticket and its Success.
Our Parish Convention has done
its duty nobly in placing in the field
a ticket, taking it all in all, the strong
est ere .orinaluled by tany partyl is this
parish.
The candidates are gentlemen well
known for honesty and integrity and
are of full capacity for their respect
ive positions, and so fair we have yet
to know of a single word havimg Iwen
spoken in ohjectioli to any of them.
So far all signs point to success and
tihe election by a full majority of the
ticket is certai if ee woerk.
We know whereof we spelak and in
mnaking this statement to our citizens
do so with a full knowledge of the
facts and figures that Natchitochles
parish is certain to give fall fire mas
dred majority for the Conservative
ticket in a free and fair election,
which we will have, cost what it may,
in November nest.
But we say also that that majority,
nor even one, elnnot nor will not be
secured by apathy or supinless.
As to the organiaition that is almost
perfect, and to. aid and assist the
cause, the officers of the ward organ
isations must at once obey and lint

that the Central Comnmittee will not
advise any measure which is not for
the god of the cause and looking to

In order, therefore, to make the

Stockton's Record up Rod River
From the New Orleans Democrat
Swe lear. that theim notorious Stockton,
the United States Marshal, who, withl
thie assistanee of thime equally notori
ons Lt. Mclintosh and hiis troopers of
thie 7th Cavalry, raided into 1Natchi
Stolehes parish in 1874, has been telling
some terrible stories about Red River
and its peoplle.
Tihe Democratl has forgotten some
strong points against this cowardly
, fellow, and we beg to call the atten.
ties of our able eoatemporray thlereto.
Stoekton is the person who is chlarg
ed with the rape of Miss Laeour, at
Colfaxr, in 1873, and eery negro who
was evecutal for that act, swore to Ais
last breatlh that Deline and 8tockton
raped the lady meutioned.
Stocktom arrested six eitizens of
this parish without warrant of law,
violently entered the residences of
widow ladies and brutally frightened
them with threats, tramping Ilis sol
Sdiers into their bed rooms in the
I search for aupposed White Leagners.
Stockton, according to the evidence
of Lt. Mclntosh, (cide his report)
"had such an exalted and outrageous
opinion of his duties, that had McIn
tosh done one half he desired, hIe
(Stockton) would have been swing.
lug to some limb, and Meilntosh rot
r ting in some jail in North Louisiana
now."
Stockton is a brave (I) man, so
t says the HeraMld reporter, "judging
from his face," notwithstanding which,
that same "face" was spit. in while
Stockton was standing at the head of
20 of Isis armed troops, and that too
Sby an unarmed eitisen.
Taking it all in all, Orantism has
throwun to the surfieo few, if anyt,
dirtier scounmrels, low-tlung, vili.
cowardly blamckguards as this same

have been Robbed.
RAI)ICAL IIECORD AT IIOME.
In 1V70 and 1871, the first commit

amine the aftlira of our parish, at
the advice of Judge R. M. Kearney.
The Chairman of that Committee was
our esteemed fellow-citizen, the lion.
M. Boyce, and it was composed of
such honorable gentlemen as M. 'ran
in, Esq., Col. R. E. Burke, Wmn.
Payne, Esq., L. Caspari, Esq., and
others we cannot remember.
From their report, which led to the
great suits under the masterly leader.
ship of Mesers. Jack & Pierson, and
M. J. Cunningham, against Tax Col
lector Boullt, we make the following
extracts
WEl.L CAI.CUIATED TO APPALL

port Radicalism.
The sherif's fees from the 4th of
March 1870, to the Ist January, t71l,
paid by the parish was lre thAosand

for the year 1871, the tax-payer was

District Clerk, filched the parish of

MUST RE REGTSTERED I
We read in thie Republican that
Kenting of Caddo has been nominat
ed for the legislature. and "the de
moeracy is demoralized." We don't
wonder. We should be amazed if
they were not. When Keating of
Cado can be nomoinated by the Re
publicans for the legislature, without
ddemoralising the Democrats," we
don't want to live any longer. WVe
have always considered that the
Democrats were human beings., and
that the Radicals of Louisiana poa
sesaeed some narrow streaks of de
eener and honor. If Keating could
Ibe nomlnated or any oeffice without
"demoralizing tie Democrats," botlh
these cheering fancies would be
knocked out of us. The fact that
Keating's nomination "demoralizes
thIe democraecy" shows that there re
mains something to live for, aId
conies like a ray of sutshine through
the darkening clond. If Kellogg withl
his United States men-of-war, amed
the Federal army, can succeed in
getting Packard in the Governors'
oflice, we shall see Keating in tihe
legislature if he does'nt get but forty
votes. We shall also see him as a
member of the State Board of Eduna
tino, tlhat Costly ornament, built of
brass, incompetency and cheek. This
is the way the l~publican party in
