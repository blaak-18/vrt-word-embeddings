COATS OF ALL LENGTHS.
Some Reach Only to the Knees,
Others Touch the Skirt Hem.
[Special Correspondence.]
New York. Jan. 2ti.-Just one-half our
wraps are as long as our dresses, while
the others are in all kinds of lengths.
Each has been designed to suit some
particular taste, and so there is a very
wide choice. The Monte Carlo coats
are still *with us, and many of the gar
ments offered for midwinter are in that
shape, while the kimono clit is of
fered for those who like that best.
There is something to be said in favor
of each. After them comes the auto
mobile coat generally lined with squir
rel fur. It has need to be warm for the
purpose.
The automobile coats are long enough
to reach the knees in any case, and
sometimes longer. Shorter efects are
preferred for runablnuts. and there are
many kinds of these. The least com
fortable ones are cut llr ng at the bot
tom, something like the extreme sth les
of the men's coats of the bast season.
They set out around the bottom ;om'
what stiffly and are stitched several
times to make them do so. A novelty
In the sleeves is that there is but one
seam and that is directly on the top,
and the sleeve itself is the old bell
shape, now quite a fad and called pa
goda.
In the illustration can be seen a coat
in this des:gn. and many there be who
think it perfect. The coat is lined with
fur, and there is a stole of pointed
beaver reaching to the bottom after
spreading out wide on the shoulders
like a victorine. A muff to match is
carried with it and would lead one to
think that the stole was postiche, but it
isn't. It belongs on the coat.
The longer coat beside it is made of
black twilled silk, heavy and thick. and
is finished on the outside like cloth,
with stitching. There is a cape some
tlis: like those on the Monte Carlos,
but yet not exactly the sate. This
style of coat is lined with fur. general
ly of the less expensive varieties and
always close furs. The collar and long
revers are of mink or some other dark
and deep fur. The revers are so made
that they can be thrown back and the
collar left flat, or they can be buttoned
across the chest and the collar lifted to
the proportions of a storm collar. By
many this style of coat is preferred to
one with fur outside.
The long ulsters are as fashionable
as they ever have been, and they are
made to reach quite to the bottom of
the skirt. The backs to some are cut
'somewhat in the princess style and In
others straight sack shape. Again In
others there is -a doubhe fold from top
to bottom, and a few have stitched
yokes. There are also many elegant
coats In a semibistoric cut really
dressy and pleturesque,

HIGH LIGHTS OF FASHION.
Latest Small Points In the Dress of
Modish Women.
Never were the small accessories of
dress of as much consequence as now
belts, neckwear of all kinds. scarfs,
garnitures for hair and corsage. as well
as countless other small addenda of
the toilet are in the greatest demand,
and materially aid in carrying out de
sired effects.
For years the dainty little collars and
cuffs of lawn were supposed to be the
exclusive prerogative of widows, but
such Is the feminine desire for all
things becoming they have now been
adopted for general use and are grow
ing in favor with each season, as noth
ing gives a prettier or more immacu
lately dainty finish. When the fact is
added that they are almost universally
becoming, the only wonder is that they
were not sooner apureciated. In a
simple and iaiexpensive set the collar
is very deep and opens in front. and
either a stock of some suitable color
or a ribbon tied in a small bow with
ends to the waist may be used with it.
The cuffs are much narrower and the
same pretty work of embroidered vio
lets and hemming is employed as on
the collar.
Amohg tV little points worth know
ing is that many modish women are
now wearing the finest of wool or an
gora mittens over their white kid
gloves when walking- Thus a double
purpose is accomplished-the hand
which holds the skirt from the ground
is protected from the cold and the glove
preserved immaculately white. The
latter reason alone would never suffice,
for who ever heard of a custom being
received into the good graces of modish
women because of its economy? How
ever, the Idea started with those who
love sports and lead an outdoor life
in winter as well as summer, and has
now been adopted by many who have
found its comfort worth consideration

notepaper and shears. Select paper
covered books, well and firmly bound
if possible, then remove the outer cov
er, leaving only the plain and title
pages. Cut a strip of linen as long as
the back and two inches wider. Paste
it along the back, leaving the extra
inch on each side free. Lay the book
down on the cardboard and make it
even at the back, then allow an eighth
of an inch on top, bottom and front.
Cut two such pieces for the sides.
Put paste on the outer sides of the
strip fastened to the back and press the
cardboards on either side of the book.
Another strip of linen the same width
may be fastened over the back and
sides for greater strength. Put the book
under a heavy weight until dry.
Now cut a piece of linen large enough
to cover the entire book, allowing half
an inch extra on all sides. The sides of
the book may be pasted all over, or
merely the Inside edge, when you fas
ten the cover on. Lay it carefully on
the cardboard and press it perfectly
smooth and tight, taking care to keep
the thread of the linen straight. Fasten
the edges on, he inside. Cut slits half
an inch long on either side of the back
at top and bottom, turn in the little

For the peacock feathers choose a

of colors ranging from blues, greens or
purples, keeping them very bright.
A French Vegetable Soup.
For a French vegetable soup cut a
large onion into thin slices and put
them in a pan with three tablespoon
fals of butter: let them simmer to
gether half an hour and tdd two quarts
of water. Have prepared one pint of
white turnips cut into cubes, the same
amount of potatoes, half a pint of ca-s
rots, half a pint of the white part of
the leek cut into thin slices; add one
clove of garlic, one eschalot, one tea
spoonful of sugar, one-third of a tea
spoonful of pepper and salt and cook
slowly one hour, adding some chopped
parsley fifteen minutes before the soup
is removed from the fire. This soup
may also be used for a vegetable puree
by pressing it through a coarse sieve
and to a pint of the thick soup adding
a pint of boiling milk.
