CRUCIAL AND TIMELY TASK FACES NATION
next that resulted remained substan
tially unchanged. The strength of
Gillett and Garrett fluctuated some
what, but the twenty-two insurgents
maintained a solid front.
There was a deadlock which the
independents were phsitio* to.
continue . indefinitely. lii only two
ways could it have been broken. (1)
By their surrender, and (2) through
direct or indirect Democratic aid to
the Republicans.
What the Protest Meant
In nominating Mr. Cooper for
speaker, Mr. Browne of Wisconsin
stressed the fact that his candidacy
represented a demand for sunk con
structive changes in the rules # as
would restore deliberation and break
the power of the bosses to control
legislation. He said:
“If the man I am about to name
be elected speaker at this time, he
will stand for a reformation of the
rules that govern this • body. The
rules of the House of Rfljggsentatives
are such that they give, many times,
a small minority in this body the
power to control legislation and pre
vent bills from coming out of com
mittees and being considered upon
the floor of the House. Under our
rules today 95 per cent of all of the
business that we transact is trans
acted in the committee of the whole,
and 95 per cent of the votes cast in
this body under our present rules
are cast in the committee of the
whole, where, under the rules, no
record vote can be had and which in
effect is a secret ballot. The people
of the country are determined and
have demanded that the proceedings
of this legislative body, said to be
the greatest in the world, shall be
open and above board, that every step
in legislation from the time measures
are voted upon in committees until
final action be taken on the floor be
taken in the light of publicity, and
that the people of the United States
have the opporunity of seeing how
their members, their agents here,
have voted.
“A number of years ago the rules,
of this body were amended and the
speaker of the House then was di
vested of the great power which he
had up to that time enjoyed. That
change in the rules of the House of
Representatives decided a presiden
tial election. Today many complaints
are justly made against these rules,
and many glaring defects pointed
out. One of the complaints is made
that seven men, who constitute a
majority of the committee on rules,
have the power to stifle legislation,
and have frequently exercised that
power. The committee on rules has
been called the morgue of legislation
in the House of Representatives.”
December 5, after the Old Guard
concession had been made and ac
cepted, Mr. Nelson of Wisconsin,
submitted a statement to the open
House, as follows:
A committee of the progressive
group of the House of Represent
atives, consisting of Messrs. Wood
ruff, LaGuardia and myself, met with
Majority Leader Longworth last
evening and discussed the proposed
procedure for a revision of the rules
of the House. At this meeting mu
tual assurances were given that the
following program would be carried
out:
1. That the rules of the Sixty
seventh Congress should be adopted
as the rules of the Sixty-eighth Con
gress for thirty days only.
2. That during these thirty days
amendments to the rules may be
offered by any member, to be re
ferred to the committees on rules,
which committee shall consider such
amendments "nd make a report there
on to the House.
3. Within such thirty days the
committee shall make a report of the
rules and such amendments as they
recommend. The rules and amend
ments as reported by the committee
shall be subject to reasonable dis
cussion, amendment and record votes
of the House.
4. When the committee shall have
made its report any member of the
House shall have opportunity to offer
amendments to any rule of the House
and may call for a record vote there
on, whether such rule have been in
cluded in the report of the committee
or not.
5. One motion to recommit shall
be in order.
Then Nicholas Longworth, the
caucus-chosen majority leader, was
asked, publicly to acknowledge his
agreements. He did so, with appar
ent reluctance, in this language:
“As far as I am concerned I agree
to the interpretation of what the
House will have an opportunity to
do in regard to it.”
Following that “understanding,”
Mr. Gillett was elected speaker, 215
to 197, with the independents casting
the deciding votes.
The Thirty-Day Promise
What the independents got, there
fore, was not performance, but a
promise which, in the light of pre
vious promises of a similar nature,
is of questionable value. In fact, the
affair might be likened to the sale
of a large property, without a cent
paid in cash, to buyers whose habit
it had been to let their notes go to
protest.
This very doubtful adjustment of a
most vital public matter was followed
quickly by the adoption, for thirty
(Continued from page 1)
legislative days, of the old, discred
ited rules. Bertrand N. Snell of New
York, slated by seniority and the cau
cus to be chairman of the committee
on rules, offered the resolution to put
the old rules into temporary effect,
as follows:
“Resolved, that the rules of the
House of Representatives of the
Sixty-seventh Congress be adopted
as the rules of the House of Repre
sentatives of the Sixty-eighth Con
gress until January 14, 1924.”
Then, instantly, Mr. Snell was on
his feet, and of course recognized,
to say:
“Mr. Speaker, I move the previous
question to the adoption of the reso
lution.”
“Moving the previous question,” as
everybody knows, shuts off debate
and absolutely prevents amendments.
On this occasion it was a cowardly
thing to do. It was a confession of
insincerity on the part of the ma
chine towards rules reconstruction.
The House had no pressing business
to perform. Several days might well
have been given to debate upon this
all-important subject, but not even a
minute of discussion was permitted.
The “previous question” is as much
a necessity to a legislative boss as a
jimmy is to a burglar. No sooner
had the independents raised their
embargo on the boss program then
this parliamentary bludgeon was used
against them.
This suggests the real truth about
the situation. By yielding their bal
ance of power on the only issue, and
at the only point, where it could be
effective, the progressives lost their
only sure opportunity to accomplish
rules reform. Q
They will get a chance at rules re
form—thirty days hence. But in the
meantime the Old Guard has made
that fight q hundred times more dif
ficult, if not completely impossible,
by reassembling the old machine and
re-establishing the same vicious sys
tem. So long as the independents
could obstruct the organization they
were in a position to enforce their,
demands for more wholesome legis
lative conditions. Now, having yield
ed that, they must combat a ma
chine that did not exist before.
Where all the powers of obstruction
were in their hands, now all the pow
ers of obstruction are Old Guard con
trolled.
They surrendered also another
mighty element in their favor. When
the issue upon which they locked
horns with the bosses was that of the
speakership, the insurgents actually
had- the balance of power, because,
being a strictly partisan question, the
Democrats would vote solidly for
their party candidates. Most of the
Democratic leaders do not want the
House made Democratic and delib
erative any more than do the Repub
lican regulars. Their record on rules
reform proves all that. Accordingly,
when they come to vote on issues of
procedure a decisive portion of them
will be found against the more vital
changes. Although the Democrats
may talk to the contrary, they de
sire that the system be left sub
stantially as it is, in order that its
spoils and perversions may be theirs
to enjoy when the House is again in
their hands. Were this not true, they
would have joined the independents
in favor of reconstruction. Instead
they sat back and watched the great
opportunity go by.
In brief, the Old Guard have elect
ed their speaker, with all the par
liamentary advantages that go with
that position; they have reorganized
the standing committees with their
own chairen and personnel; and they
have readopted, for the period of the
controversy, the old reactionary rules
under which they can now make the
fight against any publicly vital
changes in the system. They have
gained every conceivable advantage,
including that of enough certain
Democratic support to make their
final “victory” assured.

Klan Rules for Reform Program
Obviously the progressive group
should not have agreed to any post
ponement of constructive action.
They should have made their fight
to change the system when the rules
were adopted. That was their only
chance to win.
“We were not ready,” may be their
answer. They should have been
ready with a complete recfraft of the
rules.
That revision should have gone
much farther and been much more
fundamental than the program for
which they did make a stand.
Now all that can be done is to pre
sent a thorough plan of reconstruc
tion and compel every member
squarely to face the responsibility
of a public record upon every impor
tant phase of it. It will be voted
down, but let the record reveal ex
actly what it was and who voted it
down. The real rules reform fight
will come in the next Congressional
elections. After all, it is both futile
and foolish for the American people
to expect a little group of twenty
two independents to prevail over bi
partisan forces about twenty times
as large. Congressmen must be elect
ed who do not need to be forced to
fight un-American conditions in the
great legislation arm of the govern
ment.
A real rules reform program must
be predicated upon an understand
ing of the basic causes of the vicious
system that now exists, as follows:
1. Partyism is the parent evil in
Congress. Party responsibility, a
strict party attitude, may assert it
self in the higher sense in one oas«
out of a hundred, but the other
ninety-nine manifestations of parti
sanship find expression in such abor
tions as spoils, seniority, secrecy and
selfish organization advantage. Par
tyism no longer determines legislative
policy; it concerns itself with pelt
and power. It has long since lost the
spirit and purpose of public affairs,
but of politics. The last election and
the next —that is the circle of its
interest, and vision. A government
of, by and for politicians—that is its
goal.
There can be no adequate recon
struction, no real re-Americaniza
tion, of the law-making machinery
without a complete comprehension of
the part end-in-itself politics plays
throughout the existing spoils system.
The possible good in partisanship is
so swallowed up and overshadowed
by its viciousness that no compromise
is possible.
A Non-Partisan Basis
■2. Boss power must be traced
to* its remotest parliamentary en
trenchments, and all those unfair
fortifications torn down. It will do
no lasting good to deal with the
agencies of obstruction; let the
causes of obstruction be removed, and
upon their foundations be built insti
tutions of parliamentary liberty and
justice.
For example, so long as so-called
rules reformers fool with remedial
devices to compel committee action,
failure will be written of their ef
forts. Instead let them dig out by
the roots every abortive boss power
that now neables a committee to
evade its plain duty, to practice ob
structive tactics, to be “a law unto
itself.”
There should be a simple rule re
quiring every committee, within a
reasonable time limit, to report back
all measures placed in its hands.
3. A hopeless congestion of busi
ness would result, the Old Guard
will answer. Of course. There as a
hopeless congestion of business any
way. The remedy for that is to con
fine the work of Congress strictly to
matters that are public and national
in scope.
Probably three-fourths of the time
not now given to “privileged” mat
ters is taken up with the considera
tion of purely local and private bills.
In this respect Congress appears
more like a municipal council than a
national legislature.
At present, for example, if the
court of claims, supposed to settle
such questions, refuses to allow a
certain claim, in all probalility the
matter is brought into Congress
through the introduction of a bill. It
is the same with pensions. What the
pension bureau regards as too ques
tionable to be acted upon is taken
into Congress. In a degradingly
petty way, Congress has become the
supreme court of plunder and spoils.
All such local “trash” should be
eliminated. The right kind of a bud
get system would accomplish most
of this. In every field where “pork”
now prevails, let Congress legislate
as to both policy and amount of ap
propriation, and then leave to re
sponsible executive agencies the ap
portionment and distribution of the
funds.
4. The right kind of a budget sys
tem woul doperate also to curtail the
“privileged business” of the House
which now contributes so demoraliz
ingly to “log jams.” If the so-called
budget system were more than a sub
terfuge, a political football, if it con
formed to vital budget principles, all
regular bills having to do with both
appropriations and revenue would be
merged into one administration meas
ure.
5. Congress must be divorced also
from the corrupting influence of pat
ronage. No national legislator should
have the slightest opportunity, di
rectly or indirectly, to build a per
sonal or party machine through hav
ing a hand in appointments. Simi
larly the “lame duck” evil should be
eradicated by making every defeated
congressman and senator ineligible
for a presidential appointment for at
least two years after such repudia
tion by the people.
6. Another vital necessity is to
reduce the membership of the House
to a workable number. True deliber
ation is a fundamental necessity in
legislation. Deliberation implies that
every member shall have equal op
portunity to represent his constit
uents. This ideal condition cannot
exist with 435 members.
Keeping in mind all the foregoing
outline of basic evils to be corrected
here are the American principles
upon which the reformation of the
House must be founded:
1. An organization based on effi
ciency, rather than spoils, which
means that partyism shall be shorn
of its sustaining plunder.
2. The outlawry of secrecy, with
respect to all agencies of legislation,
including those that are unofficial.
Nobody having anythting td do with
public business should be permitted
to meet in any part of the Capitol or
its office buildings, unless the public
' The CALL OF THE NORTH
is admitted to see and hear.
3. Restoration of the rights of in
dividual members each to represent
his or her constituency and to exer
cise a deliberative influence upon all
measures up for action.
4. Majority rule at every vital
point.
5. Elimination of all local and pri
vate legislation, confining the work
of Congress to matters that are pub
lic and national in scope.
6. Establishment of the all-impor
tant principle that regular, orderly
routine business shall be the rule and
not the exception.
7. The setting up of a real budget
system.
8. The divorcing of pork and pat
ronage from legislation.
Getting down more to details, these
reconstructive changes are absolute
ly essential to the reclamation of the
House as a truly deliberative and
representative body:
1. Abolish every standing com
mittee that is not essentially useful.
At least half should be eliminated.
2. Next provide for the organiza
tion of the remaining committees on
a non-partisan basis. There are at
present 435 members to be appor
tioned, say among twenty-nine com
mittees. For this purpose the coun
try might be divided into fifteen dis
tricts (with territory as contiguous
as possible), each having twenty
nine representatives. Then have the
representatives of each of these fif
teen districts meet publicly, with duly
recorded proceedings, and elect from
their own number one member to
each of the twenty-nine committees.
This method would not only eliminate
partyism in organization but also the
sectionalism that now prevails. In
addition it would reduce the influence
of seniority to such an extent that
new members have a voice in
legislation.
3. Have each committee elect its
own chairman. There can be no ar
gument against th|it, and it would be
a body blow to bossism in Congress.
4. All necessary committee clerks
should be employed by the commit
tee for public business rather than
by the chairman for his personal po
litical work.
5. It is indefensible and an insult
to the public that Congress should
have permitted its committees to
meet in darkness. Every standing
committee should assemble in the
open and be required to keep a public
record of its proceedings. More than
that, a journal of these proceedings
should be published at adequate stat
ed times—at least twice a month—
in the Congressional Record. The
work of its committees is at present
far more important to the public
than that of the House itself. It fol
lows, therefore, that it should be
brought into public view.
6. Each standing committee should
be required by the rules to keep such
a calendar as would enable everyone
interested to know at any time the
exact status of its business. In ad
dition, there should be bulletins post
ed and notices printed in the Con
gressional Record announcing all
meetings and for what purpose.
7. Provide a time limit in each
session for the introduction of bills,
excepting those of an administrative
or emergency nature. The first sixty
days would seem to be ample for this
purpose.
8. Then require every standing
committee, within a reasonable time
limit, to report back to the House all
measures placed in its hands. If a
bill be particularly important and the
committee desires further time for
its consideration, let the request be
made in the open House. Such a
rule would shake the foundation
forces of the machine. It would ab
solutely prevent obstruction and ob
viate all necessity for a “discharge”
calendar.
Should Have Two Calendars
Measures so reported should be
placed upon two calendar*.
The first calendar would include
all bills recommended by the com
mittees for passage, later to be taken
up in a routine; way, without any
boss-imposed restrictions which would
make a mockery deliberation.
Bills reported for “indefinite post
ponement” should be placed upon a
second calendar, to safeguard the
rights and interests of their authors.
It would be only just and reasonable
to give each author of an adversely
reported bill a reasonable time, say
ten days, in which to make a motion
for the consideration of his measure.
Were his motion defeated, that would
end it. Should the House vote for
consideration, then the bill in ques
tion would go to the first calendar
and take its regular course.
The bosses could not exist for a
day with their obstructive powers
thus eliminated.
10. Provide at once for an elec
trical voting system, to save the time
required for yea and nay roll calls,
and to remove the bosses’ stock ex
cuse for dodging record votes that
the calling of the roll takes too much
time.
11. Abolish the committee of the
whole, which is the House under an
assumed name. Or, at least, provide
that every decision of this body may
be of public record.
12. Limit the jurisdiction of the
committee on rules to proposals hav-
K. K. K. SCARE AT
MADISON, WISCONSIN
The Madison (Wis.) press informs
us that a considerable number of
Madison residents, including many
Knights of Columbus and Jews, were
badly scared when they received
postal cards carrying the following
“threat:”
PREPARE
This concerns you personally.
Madison will know the power
of K. K. K.
The police department was swamp
ed with calls for help, attorneys were
seen to bring suit against the Kisn,
and reports have it that the gov
ernor was considering calling out the
militia. Here was a Klan “outrage”
right hot off the griddle. However
the thousands of Madison Klansmen
were as much at sea as to where or
how these “threats” were caused to
be circulated as were the frightened
Caseys and their allies. But upon
investigation it was revealed that a
local movie house was merely adver
tising a film to be shown at a later
date, captioned “Keaton's Kollossal
Komedy.”
This incident proves that the daily
press in its dirty lying against the
Klan has wrought up certain classes
of citizens to such an extent that the
mere mention of the Klan brings on
an epidemic of “heebyjeebies” as Bar
ney Google would term it. As soon
as the Roman Catholics, Jews and
negroes will learn that they are being
hood-winked by mercenary fanatical
leaders and a rotten press, and that
Klansmen are gentlemanly, God
fearing, home-loving, Americans,
Protestants, and Christians, who re
fuse to be ruled or ruined by those
ranatical leaders that use the mass
of Roman Catholics, Jews, and ne
groes for selfish purposes, just that
soon will antagonisms cease, and a
better understanding exist between
all people in America.
ROCHESTERrPAirWIT
NESSES HUGE PARADE
OF PENNA., KLANSMEN
With the general constructive talk
that has ensued, and the apparent
inclination on the part of civic au
thorities in the Beaver Valley to do
all in their power to lower the lid on
lawlassness, as was evinced by the
jail sentences meted out to several
bootleggers recently, citizens of
Rochester, Pennsylvania, and commu
nity have come to the conclusion that
the parade of more than two thous
and Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
there Saturday night, December 1,
had more effect than to merely afford
a means of entertainment for thous
ands of spectators.
Just whether the Klan parade and
the floats therein that depicted vari
ous principles of. the organization
had any immediate effect upon the
general morale of the lawless ele
ment in the Beaver Valley could not
be definitely ascertained, but it ap
peared very significant that the
number of violations of the Eigh
teenth Amendment that appeared be
fore administrators of justice in
Beaver were handed out very unusual
sentences, which carried with them a
number of days confinment in penal
institutions.
In addition to the general respect
for the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
that has followed in the wake of the
parade, has come a general wonder
ment among the lesser informed citi
zens of the Beaver Valley as to the
exact manner in which the robed
Americans are able to carry on their
duties so secretly. In the parade that
moved over the streets of Rochester,
West Bridgewater and Beaver, were
no less than half a dozen automobile
trucks, on which were placed mina
ture reproductions of the objective
principles for which the Ku Klux
Klan contends—the Little Red
School, the Liberty Bell, a Memorial
to Klansman Thomas R. Abbott, of
Atlasburg, Pa., who was shot to
death at Carnegie, Pa., during the
fatal attack upon Klansmen there,
.Saturday night, August 26, and other
significant reproductions.
Not a single instance of opposi
tion to the passage of the robed
Klansmen over the streets of the
three comunities was witnessed dur
ing the night. As the long line of
men and women swung down the
steep hill leading to the main street
of Rochester, the lead band struck
up the stirring notes of “Onward,
ing to do with the regular rules of
the House, thus taking away its au
thority over gag rules and investi
gations.
Let all these proposals be present
ed squarely to the whole member
ship, when the “promise” of the Old
Guard falls due, and voted up or
down. Then the public can relate the
responsibility to individual congress
men and act accordingly in next
year’s elections.
The final test, on the “motion to
recommit,” should include a complete
redraft of the rules of the House as
they ought to be. And the progres
sives should see to it that some “fake
reformer” is not recognized to make
this motion, thus preventing an hon
est and thorough facing of the issues
that now mean so much in America.
PRO-ALIENS ARM TO
MURDER AMERICANS
—K-K-K
Jack Walton’s Ignoble Order of
“Shoot to Kill" Is Repeated
at Wellington
—K-K-K
Wellington, Kan.—Waltonism ruled
supreme in this city recently when
the mayor threw a line of gunmen in
and about the Memorial hall to pre
vent one man, a well known speaker,
from giving a public lecture on
Americanism and the Constitution.
Drawing up armed guards, creat
ing a rumpus and throwing citizens
into a state of fear and resentment
is one of the big plays usually put
up by the enemies of pure Ameri
canism, especially where the anti ele
ment is found in control of local and
state government and the press.
The speaker, who is a minister of
the gospel, contracted for the use of
Memorial hall several days previous
to the time of his address but when
he arrived at the hall about 7:30 P.
M., he found several men armed with
shotguns blocking his entrance into
the building. The building was rent
ed from the custodian, Fred Clay
born, authorized agent. Upon pay
ment of the stipulated charge for
such u-e, Clayborn issued to the
speaker the regular form of receipt
and permit.
A number of the guns were pro
cured at a local gunshop. Others
were furnished by a local hardware
store which also furnished the am
munition which is alleged to have
been ordered for the use of the gun
men at Memorial hall, twenty in
number. These gunmen are reported
as saying they had received instruc
tion to “shoot to kill” if any attempt
was made by anyone to enter the
building. It is said that Mayor
Thralls, himself passed out the supply
of ammunition to the gunmen in
the building. It is said that the chief
of police issued the “shoot to kill”
instructions to the gunmen.
Thus we find another instance
where the freedom of speech, the dis
cussion of “consecrated citizenship,”
Americanism and Constitution, is a
subject not desired by some who pub
licly paraae as loyal American citi
zens. When a public building or
meeting place is barred to free-born
American citizens, and by the force
of arms to prevent open discussion
of things that have to do with oper
ative patriotism it is time that
Americans who are Americans in
fact, awaken to what is going on
about us.

OREGON SCHOOL
ENROLLMENT CROWS
Washington, D. C.—A recent re
port of the Oregon state superintend
ent of public instruction gives sta
tistics of great interest to friends of
the Oregon school law, about which so
much controversy has waged since its
passage. According to this report,
pupils enrolled in the public schools
of Oregon in the school year 1922-23
numbered 169,376. The high schools
enrolled 32,603, and the elementary
schools 136,773. The enrollment
shows an increase of 4,916 over the
preceding year. The attendance rec
ord is shown at 95.8 per cent.
Those who believe in the Oregon
school law, which makes attendance
at public schools compulsory during
the public school term, see in this
increase not only the normal growth
due to increase of population, but a
willingness on the part of parents
who have hitherto sent their pupils
to Drivate schools to abide by the
provisions of the law even in ad
vance of the date of its enforcement.
Christian Soldiers,” and as a score
or more of mounted Klansmen, fol
lowed by a large number carrying a
huge American flag passed the in
tersection of the two main thorough
fares, practically every male spec
tator among the hundreds of specta
tors at this point raised his hat in re
spect to the colors of the nation.
The Homestead delegation of
Klansmen, which made the trip to
Rochester in a special train chartered
for the occasion, took a leading part
in the parade. They brought their
own band for the procession.
To the Homestead Klan goes the
distinction of having the first “one
hundred pfcr cent” train run in the
Keystone state.
Klan leaders in Beaver Valley de
clare the meeting and parade was a
success from every angle and state
that already constructive results are
to be noted. John Hartzell, Burgess
of Rochester, and the grand marshall
of the Klan parade, led the marchers.

PEORIA KLAN STILL
AFTER THEM
Peoria, 111.—The wily brewery own
ers of Pekin, knowing that the Klan
had met to their detriment on last
Thursday evening, decided to outwit
them on Monday by shipping another
carload of beer to the Peoria Artifi
cial Ice Co., thinking that the Klan
could not readily be notified. But
misery is again in their hearts for
this was the regular night for the
Klan’? naturalization and the Klavem
was again filled to capacity. In the
mysterious way known only to Klans
men, the “info” again leaked out and
the Klan secured, as before, the
number of the car before it left Pe
kin and we met it in ful force again
in the railroad yards of East Peoria
where the federal officers again in
vestigated to find the result similar
to that found upon opening the car
on last Thursday evening. It seems
that again within one week’s time
the same individuals have set about
to defy the law. It is apparent upon
the surface that there are some law
violators that are very anxious to
make this test case.
Klansmen were set to guard the
car which will receive the same treat
ment as did the one last week.
These men must be taught that the
people will not stand for these viola
tions and the Peoria Klan is just be
ginning to open the way.
