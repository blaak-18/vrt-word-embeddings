A CHANGE IN THE MATTER OF
COMMISSIONS.
We have decided to make a uni
form rule, giving 30 per cent com
mission on new subscriptions, and 20
per cent on renewals. We hope that
every agent will get busy and co-op
erate earnestly. If you can’t do any
-better, send along the remittance in
those nasty little clearing house cer
tificates.
THE RAILROAD DEATH MILL.
Here is one day’s grist from the
mill of death and maiming which it
seems our railroads have become; the
record, with details, was contained
in dispatches to The Constitution un
der the date of November 3:
The Queen and Crescent Railroad
wreck in Georgia, three killed, twen
ty-nine more or less seriously in
jured.
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
in West Virginia, two killed, one
missing and a third desperately in
jured.
The Jersey Central Railroad, in
Pennsylvania, one killed, two injured.
The Iron Mountain Railroad, in
Arkansas, two killed, one injured.
Eleven deaths, thirty-two injuries,
many of which will doubtless prove
fatal!
Is not this one day’s bloody exhib
it sufficient to rouse the American
people to such determined, conserva
tive action as will at least minimize
such horrors in the future?
Sherman, very rightly, compared
war to hell. Men go into battle, how
ever, with the knowledge that their
lives are on the hazard, the flip of
a coin determining, perhaps, whether
they will be stricken with death or
permanent disability.
As a matter of fact, hasn’t the
same horrifying, unnerving uncertain
ty become a part of the operation of
American railroads? Each day brings
its regular “bulletin” of wrecks in
which valuable lives are snuffed out
without a moment’s warning, or men,
women and children are crippled for
the term of their natural existence.
What man knows, when he boards
a train, whether he will return safe
and unharmed to his family and his
friends? Certainly past and current
records give him no guarantee!
Casting aside futile academic hair
splitting. the abnormal recurrence of
these affairs is due to two causes:
First, the fact that the enormous com
mercial development of the country
has far outrun its transportation fa
cilities; second, that the railroads,
through financial inability, can not
equip their lines in a manner that
enables them to handle their business.
What is urgently needed is double
tracking; the inauguration and rigid
enforcement of the block system; re
building of old track, where worn
out to the point of danger; the sup
plying of new motive power, sufficient
to make schedules without hazardous
running of risks; new and stronger
cars; the use of every precaution
against collisions, head-on, head-end,
rear-end or otherwise, by methods of
signalling which leave a minimum of
WATSON’S WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN
discretion to fallible human nerves
and intelligence; a sufficient num
ber of employees to make the money
spent for all these life-saving im
provements of avail —otherwise its
expenditure will be wasted.
It is tragically significant that, at
present, the railroads are so placed
that, instead of being able to vigor
ously forward the measures which
would remedy these conditions, they
are seemingly compelled, because of
money stringency, to either mark time
or positively recede. It is the peo
ple who sustain the risks, through
themselves being travelers or witness
ing the ordeal of having their loved
ones constantly court these dangers.
They are the factors most vitally af
fected. —Atlanta Constitution.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COME.
President Roosevelt will be urged
to come to the Pacific coast when the
Atlantic fleet steams around the Horn
into the waters of the Pacific. He>
should come. He should come to Se
attle, too, not only for the purpose of
seeing how easily Puget sound can
accommodate the big fighting ma
chines of the American navy, and how
well these vessels will fare in these
waters, but also for the purpose of
seeing somewhat more than he has
already seen of the Pacific North
west and its marvelous progress in
every way.
Mayor Taylor, of San Francisco,
will invite the President to visit that
city while the Atlantic fleet is there.
If President Roosevelt should accept
the invitation and visit San Francis
co, he should also come to Seattle.
This country will interest him. The
people out here will interest him.
Progress made along material lines,
and along mental and moral lines
also, will stir his national pride, and
at the same time give him a clearer
understanding of the real and press
ing needs of the Puget sound coun
try.
When he understands the manner
of this people, and the character of
work they are doing for the nation,
he will sympathize more keenly with
the demands of this section for gov
ernmental aid in all matters where
the government is immediately con
cerned. President Roosevelt should
come out here; he could not feel more
perfectly at home in any portion of
cur common country than in the Pa
cific Northwest. —Seattle Post Intel
ligencer.
SCIENCE AND RELIGION.
This is an age of tolerance, and it
is the unquestioned privilege of every
man to write his own catechism and
to dictate his own creed. It is a right
which the high court of public opin
ion awards and which the law doth
give. It is the very essence of our
give. It is of the very essence of our
to answer for his religious convictions
or for the absence of them. This is
not only so, but it ought to be so, and
few of us would have it otherwise.
This, however, does not mean that
our people are without Still
less does it mean that the parents of
this land desire their children to be
taught that there is no God, and that
science gives the lie to religion.
None has a higher admiration than
we for the splendid talents, profound
learning, and brilliant intellect of Dr.
William H. Taylor.
The people of this and many other
States pay deserved homage to his
scientific attainments. As a scientist
fig has few peers and no superior
among us.
We submit, however, that Dr. Tay
lor has gone beyond his province
when, from the vantage position of
his chair as professor in the Medical
College of Virginia, he steps aside to
teach the students of science that re
ligion is in conflict with the truths
of science, and that scientific re
search has impugned the existence of
God.
Dr. Taylor’s convictions on this
subject are a matter of no concern to
anyone but himself, so long as he does
not use his position and the influence
of his great reputation to inculcate
in the minds of his students his
views on religion.
It is the province of Dr. Taylor to
teach science. Let him teach it fear
lessly, regardless of where its teach
ings may lead. It is for this that
students are sent to him by their par
ents and guardians. But it is not
his province to teach religion, and
still less is it his province to teach
that science and religion are incom
patible. This is not necessary for
the teaching of science, for scientists
quite as eminent and distinguished
as Doctor Taylor have neither taught
nor believed it.
The historian, Hume, to whom the
Doctor refers in his lecture, while an
independent thinker, was not, as he
well knows, an atheist, and never saw
an atheist (so he said) until he met
one —Condorcet, we believe it was —
in Paris.
Some have wandered far from the
teachings of childhood; but those of
us who still believe in the God of our
fathers, and still respect the creed
that our mothers taught us, object,
and have a right to object, to our
sons being gratuitously taught that
the one is a myth and the other a lie.
In this State at least there are
many of us who still believe with
Massilon, that
“There is .none great but God.”
—Richmond Journal.
WHAT IS A DEMOCRAT?
“The Supreme Court of Massachu
setts is puzzled over the question
that has arisen in an election case,
what is a Democrat? We must con
fess that the learned judges have a
hard nut to crack. There is no defi
nition in the dictionary that fills the
bill. You can not learn from the
newspapers how to solve the conun
drum. Anybody can tell you what a
Republican or Populist is, but no
body can tell you what a Democrat
is, or may be. He is all things to all
men. He is a free silver man one
day and a goldbug the next. He is a
free trader in one spot and a pro
tectionist in another. He is a ballot
reformer in one parish and a ballot
box staffer in the next. They sup
port and oppose all political prin
ciples, dogmas, policies and methods
under the name of democracy! This
elastic and plastic name is all-suffi
cient. It makes black white and
white black. It makes the crooked
straight and the straight crooked.
The supreme judges will have to give
up in despair. There is ino use trying
to define a Democrat. He is a po
litical nondescript, a luns naturae.”
BENTLEY’S ADDRESS.
To the Populists of Texas:
My Dear Brothers: I hope and be
lieve, that having read my letter in
this paper addressed to the Populists
of the United States, you are willing
and ready to act promptly on the lines
therein suggested. Hence it is that
I take the piberty to request of each
one of you that you will not only try
to attend the St. Louis Conference
of November 26th, but that you will
do what you can to make it certain
that our State chairman, Col. J. M.
Mollett, of Cleburne, Texas, and each
of the three members for Texas of
our National committee, shall be fur
nished the cash necessary to enable
them to be present. Let all of us
here in Texas help him attend the
conference, where he will be much
needed, and let us alse contribute
each one, a few cents to assist our
national committeemen to meet the
necessary expenses of being present.
I am faithfully yours,
H. L. BENTLEY.
Uncle Threadbare has no idea of
trouble until to comes. The winter
storms find the barn roof leaky, the
hen house cold and wet, and the
calves drawn up around the straw
stack. What a pity it is people
can’t get ready for such emergen
cies before they come!
Prices took a tumble when the
banks began to tremble. The wisdom
of the twentieth century ought to de
vise some financial system whose op
eration would be such that the entire
business of the country would not be
dependent upon the management of a
few hundred banking institutions.
If the boys and girls are to get the
best results out of their work at
school they should be supplied with
all of the required books and other
necessary equipment. It is to be de
plored that many people are handi
capped for lack of these things, and
the work of the teacher greatly in
creased. It is worth while remem
bering that the same Providence which
created flies provided most of the
domestic animals with tails with
which to switch them off.
“Self-control in trifles trains to
self-control in crises. There is such
a thing as the habit of mastery. It
is impossible to yield to all the im
pulses of self in things that seem of
small importance and then one day
suddenly rise to conquest when a
great struggle is on. We are prepar
ing today for to-morrow’s victory or
defeat. ’ ’
