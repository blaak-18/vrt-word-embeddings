ever, recalls the barbarous hacking
to death of the Queen of Korea and
some of her maids a few years ago, an
atrocious crime of the Japanese. That
revenge would ultimately be taken
for this need occasion no surprise,
and deplorable as it all is, shows
that there is yet a spirit in humani

crime never halts at one or two vic

ject is there on foot by which the
government will limit the production
in the potash mines, so that fertiliz
er companies will have to pay mo
nopoly prices for these necessary in
gredients. Os course, the fertilizer
companies will simply raise the
prices to the consumer, so that, by
such methods, and the addition of
the tariff taxes, the farmer’s land
can go unfertilized —for few could
hope to use adequate quantities of
fertilizer at the enormous prices
likely to be charged in the near fu
ture. Well, perhaps the old father
land is not so slow, after all. Maybe
there is yet a little gumption not en
tirely appropriated by our American
high-brows at Washington. By in
iquitous rates, we can shut out Ger

for American manufacturers enor

many has a little monopoly without
which it will be pretty awkward to
get along over here, and is evidently
going to use the natural, inexhaust
ible potash supplies to demonstrate
that “those who live by the sword
will perish by the sword”. Southern
farmers, particularly, will be hard
hit. The big Western lands are still
scarcely scratched, and can worry
along without fertilizer for awhile.
Let the McEnerys, of Louisiana, and
the beautiful bunch in Florida, and
the gorgeous japonicas of Georgia,
and other Southern “statesmen”
come along and warble about “inci
dental revenue” to constituents
whose farms can’t produce without
fertilizer, and who won’t be able to
obtain it. Tariff wars with Germa
ny, France and Canada can, perhaps,
work both ways.
The tariff issue looms larger as
the months pass. Mr. Taft has just
received a nice little call-

Publishers’ Association, in an open
letter saying, among other caustic
things: "You were apparently mis
led by designing men into a serious
blunder when, in the closing days of
the tariff debate, they induced you
to reverse your previous attitude
upon print paper.” There is about
this a delicious flavor of “ye olden
tyme” when the King could do no
wrong, but any seeming of iniquity
on his part was chargeable to a de
signing ministry—which sometimes
went to the block. Pity those who
“saw’ Taft about the print-paper
schedules couldn’t get it in the neck
after the same effective fashion.

edifying to see how Alfonso’s once
favored minister gets into disfavor
with the weakling king so soon as
all their precious heads are in jeop

therefore, “quarrels” with Senor
Maura, the ecclesiastical tool and

Whatever the minister has done, at
least he has been sincerely hand-in

trouble struck, when the little rat
is eager to desert the man whom he
abetted. Great are monarchs.

Or will they line up with the ones
whose hypocrisy and indifference
makes it possible for this horror to
flourish unmolested? In every ques
tion of this sort, one wonders what
becomes of the “moral” people and
the “sound business element.” New
York panders to the vice of the en
tire country. It is a clearing-house
of sin, as well as of money. And the
New Yorker, who goes comfortably
home a moral man, to his eminently
respectable family, is just about the
last one to vote against anything that
will “deaden” his town. Let real
reform get busy and close some of
the notorious dives, and the New
Yorker feels aggrieved that he can’t
show his visitors as much “life” as
before. There are mighty few saloon
keepers and dive-keepers who real
ly own, or are in position to
control, the property in which they
do business. The solid, finan
cial element knows the evil pur
poses to which their property is put,
and goes to church, and deplores im
morality, and lets Tammany control.
Eliminate the name and the organi
zation, and another Tammany would
arise to meet the secret wish of the
great body of good people who are
so smug and respectable and grasp
ing they don’t WANT reform. They
would turn the town into Sodom it
self, if it would keep the channels of
every sort of trade gorged with the
money of visitors who throng to New
York from all quarters, hoping to
see, if not actually participate in,
the wickedness of the place. Touch
ing a man’s pocketbook is about the
quickest way to stopping his mouth
when it comes to wanting reform of
any character, and this is the answer
to the why of Tammany Hall. It
couldn’t last a day if New York de
termined to end it. All talk about
corruption on the East Side, or the
West Side, or anything else is mere
bosh. Make New York as clean as is
the average home town of the cu
rious visitor, and he’d spend his next
vacation looking at the scenery in
the Adirondacks, or fishing up in
Wisconsin. And without the float
ing, morbidly curious population of
Gotham, that town would have to go
out after business, instead of wait
ing for business to go there to it.

would be almost a crime for a writer
to fail to lug in the. gush about “fair
women and brave men”. They were all
there, and when Alfy dashed around
the tanbark, the fair beamed smiles
that outvied their jewels for bright
ness, and the brave shouted and
cheered! This is a world simply
chock full of courage of conviction,
and of every other sort, but for the
deathless, dauntless sort of heroism,
you want to get a battalion of At
lanta’s moral-element men. They
simply won’t stand for allowing a
rough and rugged old soul like Jim
Woodward getting on a spree; oh,
no! The “moral-element” lined up
to a man for “decency against inde
cency.” But when a dirty libertine,
a cowardly cur like Alfred Vander
bilt comes socially among them, he’s
good enough for the moral-element,
and they’re mighty proud he conde
scended to grace their show with his
presence.
Fresh in the minds of every mem- .
ber of that hypocritical crew which
flaunted their good clothes and ex
ecrable taste at this Horse Show
“function,” was the pitiful death of
Senora Ruiz, the lovely woman who
took her own life last spring and Al
fred H. Vanderbilt was as much her
murderer (only less brave) as though
he had killed her with his own hands.
For the brute who in ungovernable
rages, beats a woman to death, there
is horror —and yet of the two, the
elemental beast who swings for his
crime is the finer man. The miser
able coward who wins a woman’s
love, takes freely the greatest gifts
of her loyalty and affection, and then
coldly spurns her, doesn’t even risk
his currish neck when she is driven
to the lonely grave of a suicide. “An
erring woman!” perhaps some one
sneers. Shame on such hypocrisy!
Vanderbilt deliberately sought, and
deliberately used her love for his
own selfish, abominable ends, and
crushed out her life as though she
had been a worm, instead of a help
less, suffering woman. And the
cowards in Atlanta were glad to have
him. They were not men enough to
repudiate the scoundrel, and the
women had not heart enough, nor
womanliness enough, to turn their
faces away or leave the auditorium
in a body when that odious, insolent
swine came among them! Not a
dollar has he ever earned, never has
he done anything but wallow in the
slime that ill-gotten money procures.
The lovely woman he killed was as
far above him as the stars, for she
loved him, pig though he is, and her
affection clothed him with the vir
tues and graces a trusting woman
ever throws about the object of her
worship, however much the world It-
ly, and swept all
before him in the
gala social whirl.
