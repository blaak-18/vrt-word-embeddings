WILL MAEET HIERE.
As may be ~ een in the proceed
ings of tft i4~ce Jury the State
AgriculturaT Society has accepted
the invitation to hold its next mtet
ing in Lafayette. This should be
good news to the people of the
town and parish. The State Agri
cultural Society is a popular and in
fluential body composed of leading
men from different sections of the
State. Its members are intelligent,
practical men whose meeting in our
town will be fraught with many
good results. Messrs. Alex Del
homme, Sr., Ben Avant, J. C. Bu
chanan, Overton Cade, Aurelien
Olivier, H. E. Toll, J. O. Brous
sard and L. G. Breaux have been
appointed by the Police Jury to con
fer with a similar committee from
the City Council to make the neces
sary preparations for the meeting,
which a ill lie held some time next
January. The time of meeting is
yet far off and some people may be
lieve that we are rather previous in
our remarks, but we are of the opin
ion that the committee should lose I
no time, so that the people may be I
enlisted in the work of preparing a
reception befitting the occasion.
We should not let this opportunity
escape without taking advantage of
it in every possible way. As we I
have said, we will entertain promi
nent men from all portions of Louis- I
iana, and it is of vital importance I
that when they return home they
will be in a position to say a good
word for Lafayette and its people. 1
There are many other reasons why t
the people of the town and parish of I
Lafayette should show to the agri
cultural society that they keenly ap
preciate the honor thus conferred
upon them.
Eugene Field, the journalist and
humorist, is dead.
Pity Holmes can not be sent to r
Tyler, Texas. Hanging is too good I
focr such a fiend. V
It takes one million dollars a day
to run this government. Half of
that sum is paid out for pelsions,
however.
Say, Advertiser, what has become tl
of the '"comite execustifde la factio, d
amti-admimslrative?" Just as a mat- e
ter of historical fact, tell us where t
it is.
All fair-minded men concede the
fact that Gov. Foster has made an
excellent executive, but all men,
fair and unfair, will give him the s
credit of being a gilt-edged poll- t
tician.

It is related that two brothers be
kept a saloon in a Missouri town, ra
and one of them went to Chicago to to
lay in a stock of liquor. A revival ci
was in full blast when he left home ti
and he had hardly reached Chicago m
when he received this telegram: th
"Bill-Buy no liquor. Will join pi
the church tomorrow night; busi- fe
mess is taking us to hell. Jim," That be
-ight Bill went to hear Robert 3. fi
Ingersoll lecture. As soon as he te
got back to his hotel he sent oft a T
message as follows: "Jim-Hold al

close up. Bill." in
We have not a word to say de- T
sogatory to Judge McEnery, either d
as a gntitleman or as a political ai
leader. but confess to a feeling of tit
nausea when we read the gush about
him that appears in some of the pa- C
pers which so persistently abusedt
him four years ago. If the judge tit
was such a sinner during the last sti
-campaign what has he done since
s~ta time to make him a saint? in

WA TER WORKS.
S'4jit eGa ette:-At the-lastXes
sd- obe o ifty Council a resqlu
wton was adopted authorizing the
waterworki committee to borrow in
behalf of the town $4oo, an amount
deemed necessary to survey and dis
trict the corporate territory in order
to procure estimates for the pro
°d posed works. When it is consid
ered that at best the project is ex
tremely doubtful from the fact that
- the probable cost of such works will
hardly justify the people in conse
be qheent tax-Ltion, as the area to be
an- protected renders any limited sys
,j tern out of question. But aside
from arguments which arise in mind,
it certainly appears strange that just
when the city is unable to meet cur
d- rent expenses, when her resources
ate are at the lowest ebb with no imme
ed diate prospect of betterment, the
Council should jeopardize its sound
=t- business policy in such a yenture.
be There is another worthy dause, in
he volving no uncertainty of benefit,
ri- which has demanded and was re
n- fused assistance on the ground of
the city's financial straits---a cause
"g that stands pre-eminent in any com
he munity-Education. Consistency,
it, thou art a jewel indeed.
ur TEACHER.
Wy With all due respect for "Teach- 1
el- or's" opinion we believe that he is
u- wrong in censuring the Council for
en its action in this matter. It is
s- granted that at the present time
en there is no money in the town treas
n- ury. That is a fact which we all
im know, but will "Teacher" set up the
s- contention that the Council must
make no move for waterworks until
xt a sufficient amount of cash is on
is hand to carry the project through?
e- With the present revenues of the
in town it would probably take fifty
,. years to get waterworks. It is,
se therefore, necessary that a special
>e tax be levied for the purpose and in
a order that the question be presented
a. to the tax-payers in an intelligent
ty and comprehensible manner the
of costs and specifications of the pro- f
re posed plant must be ascertained,
i- and it is with that end in view that I
s- the Council has made the appro
:e priation to which our friend so
y strenuously objects.
d For heaven's sake, how much
e. longer must we wait if we are going
y to have waterworks at all? We be
,f lieve that Lafayette should have
i_ waterworks and electric lights, and
all good citizens should do their ut
d most toward getting them as early
as practicable, instead of looking
around for impediments.
d It is also conceded that "educa
tion stands pre-eminent in any com- a
o munity," and it is right that is should I
d be so; but in "any community" j
where the people are alive to the S
cause of education a good system r,
of waterworks is one of the things
insisted upon.
If 'Teacher" is desirous of pro- 3
moting tle cause of education in a
e this town the best thing for him to S
a do is to exert his energies and influ- f
ence to secure waterworks. After ft
e that is done the rest will be easy. i

Anent the "comite" we are con
strained to propound the great WVat- cc
sonian query to our esteemed con
temporary, The Advertiser. As the to
organ, exclusive and inclusive, it a
should be in position to give us an -
intelhgent answer.
All It Claimed to Be. w
Salt Lake City Tribune. July 20, 1895. in
A cleaner, brighter or more en- 6i
tertaining show than the one which w
is exhibiting in Salt Lake has never
Sbeen seen in Utah. The street pa- w
rade in the forenoon was an index
>to the whole affair. It was a de- at
I cided surprise to find such a quan- iz
:tity of clean-limbed, well-fed, nicely lic
Smatched horses as those who drewpa
the cages and band wagons in the -
Sprocession. In the ring the same th
feature was prominent, the animals au
being handsome in appearance and
finely trained. In specialties the th
: tents are full of attractive numbers.
The costuming of the performers is aci
Sall bright and neat. There is a f
conspicuous absence of scraggy, ab
Smiserable looking acrobats, attired lai
in tawdry, dirty and frayed dress. 2
The whole establishment bears evi- i
dence of wholesome and alert man- rei
agement. Mr. Wallace has kept en
tire faith with his patrons.
Mrs. WV. B. Meek. who resides at mi
Camptonville, Cal., says her daugh- lel
ter was tor several years troubled at th'
times with severe cramps in the an
stomach, and would be in such
agony that it was necessary to call i
in-a physician. Having read about m;
Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and gli
Dl)iarrohoea Remedy she concluded an
to try it. She found that it always t
gave prompt relief. It was seldom ti
necessary to give the second dose. thi
"'It has not only saved us lots of inc
worry and time," she says, "but al- ke
so doctor bills. It is my opinion thi
that every family should have a bot- foi
tic of this remedy in the ho!1se."' e

es- We note in The Shreveport Judge
lu- th.;t the newspaperman in that
he thriving little city Is not any more
it appreciated than in other sections of
is- the country. Though it is princi
icr pally due to the efforts of the local
o- papers that the next State conven
d- tion will be held in that city not a
at single representative of the press
'ill appears on the committees of
ie- "prominent citizens" appointed to
be see that proper and suitable arrange
r ments be made for the reception of
d, visitors. We sympathize with our
ist enterprising confreres of Shreveport.
ir- We must say, however, that in La
:es fayette the local newspapermen is
e strictly in it, and our sympathies go
nd to our ill-treated brothers despite the
re. absence of that "fellow-feeling
in- which makes us so wondrous
it, kind." Lafayette editors have al
re
of ways been great favorites. Since
se the checkered journalistic existence
in- of Ordway I the people of this town
:y, have never failed to recognize the
services of the local press. No one
will dispute the fact that that bright
i but erratic genius was amply
*s rewarded for what he did for the
or town. He certainly enjoyed the
confidence of many people-and no
ne doubt profited by it. His abilities
were readily appreciated by the
he solid business men of the town who
attested their esteem in various
ways. We believe that he was
made secretaty of the Business
Men's Association and at one time
he was decidedly in vogue. Unfor
e tunately he was suddenly called
ty away by the death of a near relative
' in some western State, but, unlike
the cat, he never came back. Since
his departure the local press has
continued to be recognized. Edi
at torial modesty precludes any refer
ence to ourselves, but there are our
friends VanderCruyssen and Gools
at by. Their names may be frequent
ly seen on subscription and other
committees-to say nothing of
'O the Innumerable other honors
that are actually thrust upors
the:a, such as rear seats to entain
ig ments, etc. We repeat that our
e sympathy is extended to the Shreve
port papers, but we are compelled to 4
say here in Lafayette that lingering
commodity known as the country
editor is "in it" from the start.

THE ARENA, which is pubhlished
monthly from that great seat of
learning, Boston, has just closed
the sixth year of its most successful
and brill ant career. A critic has
very properly characterized this
well-known magazine as the "lead
ing literary, progressive and refor
mative review published in the En
glish speaking world." Its pages
are filled with contributions from
the greatest minds of America and
Europe, which leatu:es alone makes
tr.is publication invaluable to all
thinking people. It is especially
indispensable to those who wish to
keep in touch with the advance
thinkers of the world. We have be
fore us a list of the names of the
eminent writers who will contribute
to carly issues of the Arena;. among
them may be mentiohed Senator
e -Morgann of :Alabama,;v!iv. .M. J
iat Savage of Boston; "Postmaster "Gen.
eral Wilson,' STiator Butler of
re North Carolina. It is wonderful
of that the price of this excellent mag
ci- azine will be reduced with the Dc
:al cember number from $5.oo to $3.0or,
- yet, it is proposed to make the
Arena for 1895 abler. brighter and
a more inviting than ever.
