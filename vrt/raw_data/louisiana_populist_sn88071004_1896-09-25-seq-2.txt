S "Another Chance."
r- The democratic party has had
absolute control of all the branch
es of the government and failed
more ignominiously than any- oth
er party. Yet the cry of the denm
ocrats is "give us a chance." We
all remember how the p ,ople of
so the South looked to the democratic
O l)arty for relief and we re.cmlher
the abundant promises w hich the
democrats muadh in each canm)aign.
But after the campaign was over
none of those promises were kept
and the excuse was, for twenty
t years, that the democrats did not
a have all the branches of the govern
ment. When the democrats cap
Stred the House of Representa
tives in 1874 they said "we can do
nothing because we have not got
the presidency." When they cap
tured the presidency in 1864, they
said "we can do nothing because
y we have not g'ot the senate,"
. They kept on saying to the people
" who were crying for relief, "wait
until we get all the departments of
the government and we will do
wonders." And the people be
lieved them and were strangely
0 loyal to the democratic party un
r til hope deferred made the heart
Y sick.
1 But, at last, the long delayed op
portunity came. In 1893 the dem
ocratic party became supreme in
all three departments. A demo
P cratic president was installed in
B the White House. A democratic
senate and a democratic house as
sembled at the capital and the peo
Spie of the south, who had solidly
supported democracy for long
weary years, said "now we shall
Sge relief. Now our party will ful
fill all its promises." Their faces
were bright and buoyant with hatp
py expectation, for they had a
blind faith in the democratic par
ty,
What did it do? Let all the
world bear witness. The demo
cratic party hastened to use its en
preme power to completely de
stroy silver in September 1893.
It ran its dagger to the hilt i.._
vitals of the peoyiw a v"ve the
dagger a wrench. This was the
"wonder" it performed. O God
it slapped the sweet face of toil
and plucked the last hope from the
hearts of the people.
This was the work of a demo
cratic administration, which has
kept up this precedent" tor four
years. It violated every promise.
It disappointed every hope. It
disgraced the name of free govern
meat and to-day it stands out as
the most discredited and the most
disreputable party m American
history. Yet from the midst of
its own self-denunciation, it cries
out for "another chance." Blind
leaders have led blind followers in
to the ditch where they lie and
struggle in a mass of misery and
confusion. Yet from this writh
ing mass of shame and wretched
es, these blind and faithlees lead
ers still cry "give us another
chanoe."
It is too disgracefual to discuss.
A "chnee" todo what? To break
some mare promises? To shatter
somemore bopest
People sometimes forget. But
surely it is too recent for people to
forget the reoord of the demo
ratic party in State and nation.

uapatims, are now ready to aban

Sewall Will Lose Californla.
1 The Populists and Democrats
have fused in California, as they
I have done in many other States in
Sthe \\'Wet. In California the Pop
Suli.ts get four, and the Democrat.
. live electors, under the fusion ar
f rangemnents. In Cahlifornia, as in
" every other state, the majority of
the Populists are middle of the
e roaders, and they declare they will
not vote live times for Sewall
r while voting four times for W\at
t son.
SAs C:alifornia is one rt those
t close States which cannot be ear
- ried for Bryan unless he gets the
entire vote of the Democrats and
Populists, it is plain that unless
, Sewall gets out of the way and
t ceases to be an estranging factor
- McKinley will carry C:;lifornia.
If a full Popilist electoral ticket
is not rut out, it is certain that
the majority of Populists in Cali
c fornia will vote only for the four
t Populist electors.
f The following resolutions were
passed at the Fresno convention:
- Whereas, The national conven
tion of the People's Party held at
St. Louis on July 22, lN,6, nomi
t nated the lion. Thomas E. Watson
for the office of Vice, President of
the United States, and subse,uent
-ly nominated the lion. William J.
I Bryan for the office of" President,
- and
Whereas, the State executive
committee of the People's pa,:rty of
California has entered into an
agreement with the executi' e com
mittee of the Democratic party of
this State by which the voters of
the People's party are compi leed
to cast five votes for the nominee
of the Democratic party for Vice
President, in order to vote for the
Populist nominee for President,
and
Whereas, The lion. John S.
Dore, member from this county of
the State central committee, and
member ac the conference c0c.n
mittee which arranged a~ I report
td said plate and agreement by a
a majority report of said commit
toe, presented to said executive
committee a nminority raport in op
iposition to said majority report;
be it therefore
Resolved, That the county cen
tral committee of the People's 1 r
ty heartily indorse the action of
Mr. Dore, and fully approves the
'iinority report ;mad~ by biam; be
it tubther
Resolved, That we announce and
emphasize our loyalty to the nomi
nee of the St. Louis convention,
and demand that we be given an
opportunity to east our full vote
for these nomineeg and none other.

and the bigicest and best steals are
yet to be heard from under this
new law. Talk of things being
unconstitutional makes u s pause to
remind our readers that with the
present Supreme Court aunvthing
is possible. If it were possible to
enact whilesome legislation in this
State to prevent gambilinr in cot
I ton it would be immediately de
clared unconstittutional. The 1xo

vicious law enacted by a Legi-la

election stealing than of the Ten

and they came back and reported
that "it war not only so but that
they made it with steam," all were
fired. Constitutional 1 , ell we

MAJOR LYONS FOR ATKINSON.
Special to the Picaynuue.-Atlan
ta, Ga. Sept. 20.-The unique
spectacle of the official head of the
Republican party declaring his in
tentien to support the Democratic
ticket is presented today. It comes
in the shape of an interview with
Major Judson W. Lyons, Republi
can national committeeman for
Georgia, who urges all the colored
people of the state to support Goru
ernor Atkinson.
This is the direct result of a deal
by which the Democrats are to
give the negroes of Georgia a fair
vote for McKinley in return for
their vote for the Democratic State
ticket, but as the negroes have to
deliver first, (Oct. 7th) they stand
a poor show of getting a fair elec
tion,
As another inducement to get
negro votes, Atkinsou has been
running the pardon mill and issu
ing circulars to the negroes calling
their attention to it.
Just what this rotten old Demo
cratic party wouldn't do to stay in
office is not recorded in the Devil's
Handbook of Facts.
She Was an Abstainer.
A lady, who is a strict prohi
bitionist, was one of a private par
ty at Fairview last summer. They
were taking supper in the pavilion,
and had given orders, when one
of the gentlemen turned to her and
said:
"Will you have some plepercut.
Mrs. X.t"
She drew herself up rigidly and
felt gromly insulted.
"No, I thank you, sir," she said.
"I never drink anything stronger
than lemonade."
Then the gentleman pointed to
the poet, and walle the rest of the
crowd laughed, she read: 1

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
I ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody ebouldi Read II.
It contains 176 pares of laugh- 1

illustrations of Cleveland as ar
