ABRAM JONES' EXPERIMENT.
BT WYOMING KIT.
"Good morning, Mr. Sheriff, how do you
do, to day f
No, much obleeged, I can't sit down, fur
I ain't got long to stay.
I conie to try an' git the loan of a p'ar o'
cultls - them tools
You buckle onto pris'ner's wrists, to
make 'em nindl the rules.
You see I'm herin' trouble at my rauche
up on the Platte
A kinder revolution in the house-an'
rich as that
Ain't pleasant to a mortal o' my domes
tic taste,
So I've come to the conclusion thet I'11
stop sich work poet haste.
I spole you've seed that wife o' mine-she
stands nigh six feet high,
With a doable-geared electric jaw, an'
the devil in her eye;
She's muscled like a pugilist-right on
the kick an' bite,
4n' kin lick me, every rattle, in a rough
an' tumble fight.
Wal, she s bin acarryin' on of late to sich
a high degree,
That I've passed a resolution sich per
ceedin's won't do me.
So I thought I'd git the handeuffs-au'
when she goes to sleep,
I'll slip 'eut snugly- on her wrists-an'
then revenge 1 ll reap.
I've tried to reconstruct her on the moral
suasion plan,
But now I'm goin' to try the vartue of a
stout rattan,
An' I think thet one good lickin' 'll kind
er tone her down
So's she won't be allers feelin' she's too
good to wear a gown
An' keep a tryin' day by day, as she's
bin a doin' of late.
To wear her husband's breeches, 'stead o'
bein' a lovit.' mate.
I know thet 1 kin lick her of I git her
hands secure,
An' a general reconstruction air needed
thar for sure.
Thar ain't a woman on the range kin do
the work she kin,
An' 1 don't suppose she's charged above
with aeny grievons sin,
But when a woman 'gins to buck, an'
try to run the shop,
It's timue to give the rope a yank, an'
fetch her to a stop.
So good day, Mr. Sheriff, I'll take these
tricks along,
To aid in teachin' Mary Jane to sing a
different song;
An' when I bring em back agin, it won't
be notbin' strange,
If I tell you thet I've got the tamest wo
man on the range.
(THREE DATS ASEB.)
"Well, Sheriff, here I am again, just so's
to be arutaed
I brought yer ban'cauffs back agin-you'll
flMid 'em safe an' sound,
They're good enough fur business sich as
your'n is I guess,
But as aids to reconstruction they ain't
no great success.
I got 'em onto Mary Jane, in satisfactory I
style,
Then carted in some willow sticks-of
which I'd cut a pile,
An' with a wback across her back, I gin
an Injun yell,
And' cried 'wake up, old catamount! I'll I
ran this ranch a spell!
I don't exactly savey how it happened,
but I found
Myself away outside the house, a claw- 1
in' at the ground!
An' Mary Jane a follerin' up, a swearin'
like a Turk,
An' every time I broke my guard a git
tin in her work,
She bunoed my eyes up in the shape you I
see em in to-day. I
An' give me several in the jaw that tuck I
some teeth away,
An' gouged, an' scratched, an' tore my
bar, an' bit, an' fit an' kicked,
Inihort, yours truly, Abram Jones, got
beautifully licked I"

nor honorable to impose this heavy
burden upon me. It would b.r

our acts to discharge this debt. (
Upon my arrival in Washington two a
weeks ago, I was assured upon the t
promise of Assistant Secretary Haw-.
ley that the amount required to sa
tisfy the judgment wou(l be raised s
as soon as the Secretary returned. I Ii
called upon Mr. Sherman yesterday I
and he proffered mi a contribution of e
$100 as the only relief he could offer
me, which I was compelled tindecimne d
tout of respect for the great FitDance d
Minister of our Government. I ex

rangement can be made of this mat- e

Hon. John Sherman, Secretary, of the
Treasury.
Dear Sir-I herewith inclose you a
copy of an official letter addressed a
to the President.
Very respectfully, tI
G. CASANAVE.
WaSaHNoTON, D. 0. Aug. 7, 1879, p
This letter having obeen read to t
your correspondent, he asked Casas.
Onave: V
"What is the amount of this judg
ment to which you refer ?" d
"The judgment," said Clisanave, t
wasorigiually $5,00, but $1.875 bave al
heen paid, leaving a balance of $3,- f
15." C
"Do the other members of the a]
board refuse to oay theamount ?" ai
"Well, they have failed to do it." n'
"Are they not holding offices in h
the New Orleans Custom-louse ?" Lt
"Yes; Anderson. Wells and Ken. lI
ner and all their family connections, so
numbering not less than forty per. t
sone, are drawing money from the Li
United States Government, besides
perquisites which, if what everybody a
says is true, amount every month to
as much as this judgment." v
"flow did you happen to come here j
about this mater ? Ishould think
that the other members having such
places in the Uustom.aouse, would
not care to have this case brought
to the attention of the Administra.
ntoo."
"Before coming here I called upon
Anderson and Kenner wiho refused
to pay anything. I went to Well's b
omoe frequently to see him, but t
could never find him; he has been '
absent from hise office a long time
and i difficult to find. Seeing that n
I could get no assistance from the u
other membters and beoing presesed
continually for payment by the ah
torneys, who threatened to sell me t
out at sheriff's esale if I did not pay
speedily, I thought I would come to a
Washington and seek relief. This '
ti what brought me here. I could V
get nothing out of the officers in E
Louslana and I came to try those
higher up. I had great confidence
in my mission here, remembering
the anolent 8panish saying that 'It
is not mooh to galve a leg to him who
gave you the fowl.'"

"Who have you seen about tbhis

"I called on the President in omn .
pany a w~h GeneruiSypher the next U
day fter my aarva. He treated me "
co;,rteuilly, but made no offer to re- i
iiteve me, and remarked tbhate habud
norsing todo with it, but advised me
so see UAnderson, who be thought it
w ,old ettle is. GenSibl 8upmr jt
sutggested to the President that he
convey his wishes in this regard to
1 Mr. Anderson in an authorative form
3 which no doubt would induce An.
1 derson to pay, althouah for me to
return to Lmisiana with the Pres.
ilent's verbal message would be
useless. The President took alarm
1 at this suggestion and retreated be.
hind the Cabinet which was about
mssemblinr. I also called on Se
t oretary McCrary who expressed
sympathy for me and s4id: 'If I
were able I would pay thet judgment
,yvself, but I am a poor man and
live entir.-ly on my salary. It should
hte ptai at once.' Of coture I was
vary grateful to the Secrorary for
rthese kind expressions, I next saw
Messrs. Shell;abarger and Wilson to
Srh mn I explained my caie. L'hey
advised me to see Asslstant Secre
nary Hawley, which I did in compa
,,y with General Syvrher. Mr. Haw
Ily referred me to Mr. Shellabarger
who he said would attend to it. I
saw Messrs. 8uellabarger and Wil
4on, who assured me, on the promise
.,f Mr. Hawley, that the money
mould be raised on the return of Mr.
$h4trman, who was then in Maine
and would be home in a week. I
waited, contented, a week, believing
that all would be satisfactorily ar.
ranged. I called on Mr. Sherman on
his return and he received me very
cordially. I stated my case to him, I
explainivg how many property was'
about to be sacrificed, and showed
him a copy of the sheriff's writ. He
unswered that he knew nothing
-bout it, and that he did not see why
Anderson didn't settle this matter,
but that the money ought to be
raised and that he would give me
$100, which be attempted to take
Crum his pockets remarking at the
same time, 'You go and see some of
the leading Republicans and collect
somethloig from them.'
"My reply was: 'I have been to
see the President and yourself and I
know no other leading Repaolioans. t
Is that the best you can do for me, -
Mir Secretary ?'
"He answered: 'That le all I can
do; I am only here on a salary and
don't pay everything.'
"I then took my hat, as I did so
saying: 'I thank you sir; that i
amount would not pay my travelling f
expenses to Washington.' then I
left his oflee very much disappoint
ed and depressed. I again sought .
the advice of Mr. Shellabarger, to
whom I expressed my great disap
ponltment at the manner at which I
bad been treated by the Secretary, '
after having been assured upon the r
word of Mr. Hawley that the matter
would be arraugod on the re urn of
Mr. Sherman from Maine. In my r
excitement I said to Mr. Shellabar. i
ger that I would expose the whole
matter of the Returnlun Board pro
ceedings and go home and pocket
the loss. He Veiy kludly advised me
not to 'throw the handle after the a
pot' but write a letter setting forth the I
flats in the case and await results =
for a few days. Iacted upon his ad- u
vice and prepared a letter, a copy of
which I have read to you, which I
delivered to the President and a copy b
to Mr. Sherman. In a few hours n
after the delhv ry of this letter I was d
informed that $500 had been sent to I
Collector Badger at New Orleans to u
apply on payment of the judgment, tl
and that more would be cent. The o
next dayl was told that $500 more e
had been forwarded to be applied in
the same manner, which I have since
learned is nout correct. 'Ihe second
unstalment of $500 was not sent. On
the morning of the 13th I received
this despatch from home: u

I went at once with the despatch to

appealed to them to see Secretary I
