I am
At least I was
The liemocratic party.
But now I am a ''orpe.
That I deserved death.
None will deny.
Not even (rover Clevelandl.
For he made the fatai thrust
That sent mnie lhenc'.
Time was when I,
The democratic party.
Was believed by all men,
At least most meu.
That was when I stood for the people.
My praises were sung in the hamlet.
Mhy reatness lauded in the Metropoli.s,
In the cabin mothers hushed their ba
bies
With the magic of my name.
In the palace my champions
Were o'erwhelmed with compliments.
The poor hailed me as their deliverer,
The rich knew me as their protector,
All classes of people 'ought me,
l: :.use of my plromises.
N hell I was in p-ower years ago.
'1 ne eountry teemed with prosperity.
Tl'he people loved me.
lBecause Jefferson was my father.
Jefferson said:
"All men are born free and equal
And should so stand before the law."
That was my doctrine
When at the height of my glory,
And the people loved me.
I was thrown out of power
For thirty years,
During which time the country suffered
much
From the rapacity ot bankers and bond
holders'and tariff robbers.
I promised the people to unload them,
I told them the greenback was good,
I told them silver was good,
I bitterly opposed national banks
And gold-bug Shylocks.
But I must have a "chance."
A "chance" was all I wanted.
A "chance I must have.
And I soid myself to get it,
Sold myself to Wall street,
And Lombard street
And to the Rothschilds
And the Heidelharhs
And the Ikelheimers,
By bowing down to their Baal.
And electing him president.
My leaders all knew him to be
A benchman of Shylock,
But the people didn't,
And they elected him.
We said: "The people are fools,"
..e thought they were,
But they are not.
As the stiffened corpse before you
Gives mute testimony.
Some persons think I'll revive,
Especially the office-holders,
They hope so,
But I have grave fears,
Very grave.
If ever I do
I will do it by kicking overboard
Shylock's whole crew,
And by the time I do that
Anbther party may take my place,
And I be buried forever.
For fear I do I'll say here and now
'Gooa-bye world, howdy hell."

Democratic Prayer.
[From Morgan's Buzz-Saw.]
Oh, Grover, our political father.
chief of mugwumlps, boss of the
cuckoos, and high-cock-elowrem of
the low-cock-ehighrems, we how
down before thee as a persinmmon
sprout bends beneath the weight of
a big fat 'possum. We acknowl
edge thy greatness and glory in
our littleness. We know, most
gracious master, that thou art
more account than all of us put
together. If it were not so why
should we lie for thee, and steal
for thee ? Thou speakest and thy
voice is heard throughout the laud.
It soundeth like distant thunder.
WVhen its deep, gutteral tones are
heard, men tremble and bow down
and worship thee, but women run
and hide. They remember the ex
perience of Maria Halpin. They
wot not what thou wisteth, neither
care they to be wisted with the we
which thou wotteth, nor wotted
with the wist which thou wisteth.
The trusts worshil-thy name and
singeth thy praises. Thou rais
eth up in the morning and goeth
fishing while the tariff bill is be
coning a law, and the whisky trust
hegetteth a movement on it and
saveth millions of dollars by. ta
king whiskey out of the bond.
And the sugar trust senteth profits
afar ott and ships laden with su
gar are hurried in from foreign
ports. Oh, most gracious master,
thou art a honey. That fishing
scrape cost the country ten million
dollars, but "we the people-thy
humble servants-pay the freight.
It pleaseth us to do it. We wish
it was some more. We won't
complain. We are not fit for any
thing else. We ought to apolo
gize for being born and having the
semblance of men. We are fit on
ly for thy footstools-thy lick
spittles. If we have any sense we
feel like we ought to beg thy par
don, for it detracts from thy great
ness. Oh, most admirable Cleve
land, what can we do for thee that
we haven't done to humble our
selves in thy sight? We have de
nied our faith; we have lied like
dogs; we have sacrificed our best
friends; we have insulted our
neighbors; we have voted poverty
upon ourselves and children; we
have neglected our wives; we have
crucified humanity and mocked
God in our blind worship of thee.
But we would do more, most wor
thymaster. We would lie down
on our bellies ald grovel in the
dirt; we would sti.ck our noses in
the mud; we would wriggle up to
thy feet and pare thy toe-nails with
our teeth, if to do so would only
be called Democracy. In the name
of Democracy and for Democratic
success we are willing to steal bal
lots, kill niggers, intimidate Popu
lists, desecrate the ballot box, cru
cify liberty, corrupt courts, buy
legislatures, and undermine our
republican institutions. If we
have any political opinions we are
willing to change them to suit thee.
Have we not done it, most adora
ble master? Did we not say we
were in favor of free silver and
don't we now swear it is a fraud
and endorse thee in every conven
tion? Did we not say that protec
tion was a fraud and we do not
now support the Senate tarif bill
with all our strength? It is writ
ten, "The leopard can not chang
his spots," but we can bchange our
politice. It is also written, "Can
the Ethiopian (which is the nigger)
hange his skint" We can, not
oly change it for him (to a bright
yellow), but we can skin him in
the most approved style. We are
Democrats of the modern type
with all the latest improved
attachments. Take us under thy
tutorship. When thou wantest us
to chage our principles, toot thy
bmaoo, aditdhallbe so. Weare
thy politicl tumblers. When the
tooter toofeth the tumblers tumb
lst. D ds is Democracy, rs we
understandit. The manphlank in
the p~orm is for us to do as we
areokd. So doeth we. Let thy
msm dpemd on us. Thee, and
th only, dBo we erve. Thipaame
will be our mat, d whiskey our
bink, now andA rne.
