The Democrat-Journal brings T.
Jonathan Guice to the fore as hav
ing endeavored to organize an oath
bound politicial combine in DeSota.
He declared the Alliance defunct,
denounced the Ocala platform, and
his effort collapsed by T. Jonathan
leaving both hungry and disgusted.
Mr. Guice is a dead duck in the
politicial pit and will come to gritef
in the end. The sentiment of the
Alliance is to make the fight within
the Democratic lines, and it is the
best and most commendable policy

J'*IIICII WILL TIIEY SER VE
In this country of boasted freedom
we often hear a great deal of a "gov
eminent of the people, by the peo
p le, and for the people." Politicians
n, ever tire of plating about the liber
9ites of the people and their inalien
sbe ights. Statesmen, when seek
 .votes, patriotically proclaim
mselves the humble servants of
r constituents. Amidst shouts
g'u'reat enthusiasm platforms are
ted ostensibly for the special
tion of the masses against the
eed and rapacity of trusts and
 prations. Reforms are pro
~i and a bright future is por
d to the voter by eloquent
The election is held and

most dangerous enemies of the peo- I

Is it the people, the masses, who p
aft consulted on any prdtosed leg

the iron trust, the coal trust. A a
plain case of "you pays your money
and you takes your choice." When
a piece of legislation is offered for f
the benefit of the people, immediately t
there bobs up a protest from some a
trust or monopoly, and the interests F
of the people are soon lost sight of.
In the midst of all this deception ;
there is yet hope. A brave and f
courageous leader has dared to raise I
his voice against the power of money.
In his lettter to Chairman Wilson,
President fleveland has sounded J
the note of warning to the traito

and the issue is squarely presented:
"The people, or the trusts?" Which

white man who was a Rebublican in

CONFESSIONS IN POLI
TICAL CAMPAIGNS.
Confessions are a new feature in
political campaigns. In Colonel
SBreckinridge's district in Kentucky,
the voters seem to be very fond of
listening to confessions from the
candidates. Evan E. Settle, one
of the colonel's opponents, caused
much surprise by confessing that
twelve years ago he lost everything
he had at cards, mortgaged his
home, and that his wife sued for
the recovery of the money. He
told how she got judgment in the
lower court, how the case was ap
pealed, and the decision of " the
lower court reversed and that she
never got one cent. He said that
his wife brought the suit to save
him and his little ones; to save
him from a drunkard's grave and
the little children from starvation.
While he was making this confession,
Mr. Settle was nearly overcome
with emotion, and many persons in
the audience shed tears when he
told how his patient, loyal wife
would wait for him, sitting in the
back door until he staggered home in
the gray of the early dawn, bank
rupt in purse and bereft 'of reason
with liquor.
Mr. Settle's confession was received
with hearty applause and it is gen
Serally believed will be the means of
1 making a large number of votes for
him. .Public confessions of a
personal or political nature are a
new departure in American politics,
which, we hope, will not be intro
duced in our own Louisiana, where
the average politician will prefer to
