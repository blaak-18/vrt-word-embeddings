advent- of
a n breech - loaders
and breeches,
when the wet
weather de
clared itself as resolved to have its .ia
a ings, used to retire to his badly ven
tilated whare, and casting aside his
flax-woven toga lounged beside his fam
Ily on the general mat in a state of
natural freedom, until the sun once
more broke from the clouds; or failing
the vicinity of a friendly whare, he
went after an enemy to keep himself
warm, it not dry, and consoled himself
for getting drenched by breaking the
sixth commandment. However, after
umbrellas were introduced to his no
tice, and his visitors paid him in
gold for the use of his lands, he no
longer had the same excuse for staying
indoors or "ecolling" an enemy; there
fore he gradually settled down and
gratified his lawless passions by becom
ing a member of parliament.
But between the stages of man eat
ing and dress suits there were wars and
retaliations between the Pakeha and
the Maori which took away a good deal
of the pleasure of living in New Zea
land.
In the northern island, of :which
Auckland is the capital, the natives
were the most contumacious, and deeds
of peculiar atrocity were by no means
uncommon. In the Kauri forests frag
ments of human beings were frequent
ly found scattered about as they had
been tossed, after being hacked to
pieces, .and, of course, the crimes were
atonce put down to the original owners
of the land.
Oni the other side of the bay which
stretched bjetween Auckland and the
king's country, stood a shanty or drink
ing shop which also served ad' the ferry
station. The landlord and his twosons
acted as fterrymen, and did at one time
a brisk trade to and from Auckland
city, while the wife acted as hostess;
and as this shanty was the only house
which stood on that side of the water
at tile time, she had most of the travel
ers as customers,
Behind -the shanty lay the primeval
forest, dense and uncleared, with the
knurl gums rising straight and grace
ful like masts from the undergrowth of
fern trees, supple-jacks and wild mint,
and it twas in this scrub that most of
the grewsome discoveries were made.
Travelers were ferried over from the
city, and never came back again, or at
least never canme back as they went
away; so that the mysterious murders
continued. while Tom the ferryman
and his two sons had to get most of the
return fare from the police, when they
delivered as much as they could gather
of the dismembered travelers foridenti
fiction by their friends. A melancholy
besiness that ferry must have been
to take over live men and bring back
ghastly chunks--and the citizens won
dered that these ferrymen's nerves
could stand the constant shoclks.
One day Tom and his sons ferried
over two young men who had made up
their minds to have a few days' sport
with gun and rod in the forest, despite
its evil rerute. They were both Eng
lishmen and new chums, and like Eng
lishmen traveling for pleasure were
pretty free with their money, showed a
good deal of it as well as a lavish dis
play of jewelry, while they laughed
easily at the warnings which they re
ccived.
They had their flasks with them,
therefore did not linger at the shanty
when they landed, but struck straight
out for the forest, and, as they told
Tom's wife on their return, had good
sport until the rain came on and drove
them back.
It was about noon .when they re
turned on the fourth dclay, after wad
ing for mhany hours through the
swamps, with that persistent and bone
chilling downpour saturating them as
"TEE BOAT ifAS GONE TO AUCKLAND."
it did everything about, and the first
thing they did was to seek the bar and
ask for a stiff jorum of brandy each,
and while the hostess was placing the
bottle to their reach they inquired
about the boat.
The landlady, an aged female nearly
bent double with rheumatics and other
infirmities ot time, received them in a
very friendly manner, told them that
the boat had that morning gone to
Auckland and would not be back for
some hours as the weather was so
rough, and offered to light a fire in the
parlor, so that they could warm and dry
themselves meanwhile, an offer which
they gladly accepted.
As she told them there was no one at
home but herself, she left them in pos
session of the bar while she went out
to jrepare the roomfor them, and thus
helping- themselves, as was the custom
in colonial bars, they took up the liquor

carefully so as to test the quality before
drinking it, after which he emptied it
hastily amongst the sawdust at his feet
and caught at the upraised arm of his
companion.
"For God's sake don't drink any of
that stufft, Charley," he whispered. "it
is drugged"
"But -I have done so already, Jack,"
replied the other, with dismay in his
tones.
"Then take no more, but pour it out
as I have done mine -quick, for the old
hea is coming tback. There, now keep
quiet and I'll manage the rest."
At this moment the old woman came
back, and, easting her eyes over the
empty glasses and the bottle, from
which she could see a quantity had
been taken, she said:
"The room is ready now, gentlemen,
if you will step round, and the fire will
be up in a few moments, so that you
can rest and dry yourselves while I
get you a cup of tea and something to
eat."
"Yes! let us go in, Jack, for I feel
confoundedly tired and sleepy," mur
minured Charley. as he leaned heavily on
the counter, with his eyelids closing.
"No. Charley, we'll walk about in
stead outside," answered Jack, firmly,
getting hold of his companion's arm
and beginning to drag him to the door.
"Surely you are not going to stand in
the rain till the boat comes," cried the
old woman, in astonishment. "Why,
the rain is worse than ever, while it is
so comfortable inside, with a nice sofa,
where your friend can rest himself if
he is tired."
"Yes-let us go to-fire-comfortable
sofa-sleep," muttered Charley, inco
herently.
"No," answered Jack. "Outside or
nowhere. There is no one else about
the place, I suppose?" he asked, as he
thought he saw the door of the shed
opposite move.
"No one at all, not even a dog or a
cat," answered the old woman, as, with
a sour look, she watched him drag his
almost senseless companion into the
rain.
Down to the beach, where he had a
clear stretch of sand, he half-dragged,
half-carried his friend, and for the next
four hours he forced him by every de
vice hlie could think of to walk about,
while the rain poured down persistent
ly, and the sea was ruffled, misty and
gray in front.
Hle kept a watchful eye on the house
and that shed in front of it, and twice
or thrice hlie could have sworn that he
saw the door open a little way and a
face look out from behind it. The old
woman also came from time, to time to
the bar doorway and screeched at him
to bring his friend in to the fireside,
KEEP A WATCHFUL. EYE ON THE HOCLSE ;
but he held on doggedly and sternly to
his promenade, casting an eager glance
seaward for the expected boat, with his
one arm round his friend and the other
hand clutching the stock of his re
volver, which rested inside the water
proof breast pocket of his coat.
At last his heroic efforts were crowned
with some success. The effects of the
drugged mouthful of brandy wore of?
and Charley wolke up dazed and side
from the salt ,Water Jack had forced
down his throat, and with a splitting
headache, but still with his senses suf
ficiently clear to comprehend his posi
tion.
At the same time the boat was in
sight, with the old boatman only in it,
struggling against the wind and tide,
and shortly afterwards they were
bargaining for their passage on the
beach, Charley looking on passively
while Jack exhibited his gold and re
volver at the same time, and so half
tempted, half threatened the unwilling
Tom back again to his place at the row
lock, while the old crone shrieked and
raved wildly at the house door, about
her man going back to Auckland in
such weather.
Jack made no allusions to his sus
picions, but only spoke about urgent
business in Auckland that day: so at
last the old man yielded and once more
pushed off tc sea, and, as the wind was
in their favor, before nightfall they
were landed safely at their destination,
and wvent about their business, which
was to the post oflice; the result of
which w~as that at picked body of men

an, the two hulking sons were found,
wvith a, considerabic quantity of miss

be a shambles.

FARMER AND PLANTER
ASHES OF PLANTS.
Their Value as a PFertillaing Agent BrUeSI
Conasidered.
When any organic substance, with
few exceptions, is burned in contact
with the air, there remains an incom
bustible residium called ashes, consist
ing of that portion of the plant which
is exclusively mineral. The ashes vary
according to the nature of the plant,
the portion consumed and the locality
in which it grew. The mineral part of
the substances composing the ash are
more essential than the organic or
combustible portion of the plant. Most
of the plants which grow in sea water,
or near the ocean, contain soda and
also potash. Even wheat, when grown
near the borders of salt water, thbough
in soil containing little or no soda, is
found to yield soda. These substances
have very similar . properties, and
are to a certain extent inter
changeable in certain plants; but
this is the exception, and not the rule.
Sea plants, though always containing
soda, are never without potash; in moat
cases, indeed, it predominates. (Sea
weed makes an excellent manure when
composted.) As like causes produce
like effects, plants that are similar, and
grown under similar conditions, pro
duce ashes that are similar. Different
parts of the same plants, as the leaves,
the branches, the trunk and root, yield
ashes of different composition. The
difference of the mineral contents of
wheat straw will vary from three to
fifteen per cent., and in oat straw from
three to ten per cent., and under cer
tain circumstances is greater at the
bottom of the stem than St the top.
The amount of mineral food is greater
in the leaves than in any other portion,
and it is precisely in that part of the
plant where assimilation is most active
(fermented or decayed leaves make a
good vegetable fertilizer).
The tuber of the potato contains in
its ashes as much as eighty-six parts in
the one hundred of the salt of potash,
while the ash of the top contains only
four parts of these substances. The
tuber gives only fourteen parts of lime,
and no silica, while the tops contain as
high as thirty-six parts of silica. Anal
ysis has shown that the ashes of
grain give a different result from
those of straw, and this is particularly
illustrated in the wheat plant. The
grain, especially the husk or bran part
of wheat, is rich in phosphoric acid and
in magnesia, while the straw yields but
a small portion of either substance.
The straw contains. much silica, and
some potash: the grain but little. Oat
straw contains more than double the
quantity of potash than wheat straw.
By exporting the grain from the farm.
therefore. the soil is improverished
of certain minerals, especially phos
phoric acid, which are not rc
turned to the lnnd in the
straw. The mineral portions of all
vegetable and organic matters exist in
the ashes and in the plant in different
conditions. In the latter case they are
more or less combined with vegetable
acids, which are combustible,and when
the plant is reduced to ashes they are
destroyed, leaving the minerals them
selves more or less altered and differ
ently combined. In the decaying
plant they a-re in assimilable condition,
passing from one state to another, not
having been segregated by the effect
of heat, which, according to its in
tensity. has a disadvantageous effect
upon their action as a fertilizer. Thus
silex, which in tihe plant may have
been in atomic division and soluble, by
the effect of heat becomes gritty and
insoluble. The alkalies may by the
same agent enter into insoluble con
ditions with that substance, and
thus be rendered inert for an in
definite period. As the ash of a
plant represents the mineral food
which has once been assimilated, so
far as their nature in this capacity has
not been destroyed by heat. so far are
they useful and valuable far fertilizer.
All plants yield ash residuums, lint
they differ in their richness and quan
tity. The amount of ash residuum of
the tobacco plant is very large and
especially rich in potash, and is there
fore trying and exhausting to the soil
of this mineral. No plant can be use
less in this respect, and vary in value
according to certain constituents which
are of more -value than others. lic
sides, as has been stated, their value
may be deteriorated `by the degree of
heat to which the organic matter has
been subjected, although a large
amount of-carbonaceous matter not
perfectly combusted is no disadvan
tage, as we know that charcoal is a
good condenser of gas. and will be
valuable for this property as a fer
tilizer. Ashes are more or less greatly
injured by being left exposed to damp
ness, by the loss of the alkali, a very
important constituent of their value.
The ash of a plant yielding a large
amount of phosphoric acid, potansh' or
soda, is more valuable than those poor
in these elements. Ashes can only be
used as auxiliaries to other manures,
and should be used or applied to soils
containing much organic matter. for
notwithstanding that the atmosphere
contains the store of organic elements,
it must be borne in mind that the soil
also furnishes a part of the organic
nourishment to plants. Ashes also
have a special effect on heavy, stiff
clay soils, in causing a separation of
the articles, their adhesive nature
counteracting the tenacity of such
soils, while independent of this
mechanical effect, their chemical com
position has the same value in these as
in other applications.
In the manufacture of ashes at home
on the farm, it must be remembered
that all nitrogen is destroyed by burn
ing, this being the highest cost ele
ment in all fertilizer (and specially de
ficient in southern soil), and think twice
before consigning to the burning pile
it it would not be more profitable to ex
tract all the mineral elements by com
posting than burning to ashes. This is
relative to all small, soft uaterials-f
weeds, grass, leaves, etc.-but briars.
branches of trees, or.hard wooded sub
stances. are best burned for their ashes.
rThe ntdvatsogo If compoetinstlli oftl
materials Is the saving not only of the
high cost nitrogen, but the organic
substances as well. If commercial
fertilizers or ashes could furnish or
ganic substance, they would have as
good a value as stable manure, but
being deficient in this important cle
ment, they are never so profitable to
use except when intelligently comn
bined or used in connection with stable
manure. The southern soil is deficient
in humas, and commercial fertilizers
or ashes will never be used with profit
if sole dependence is placed upon them,
regardless of stable manure. or the
raising of green crops solely to be
plowed under for the supply of humas
or organic substance. The b'enefit of
humas in southern soils is much more
beneficial than in northern, as it adds
coolness and moisture to a soil, the
very thing so much needed in the
south, and as cotton culture is such a
humas destroying process, the raising
of green crops solely for the supply of
this important principle, is perhaps
the most important process, but the
least thoroughly understood in south
ern agriculture.-F. L. Hooper, in Tex
as Farm and Ranch.
THE REMEDY.
How to Do Away with the Evlls Attending
Overproduction.
If, as is claimed by many, farmers
are suffering from overproduction of
the two great staples, cotton and
wheat, there are but two remedies; one
is to remove every cause that prevents
an extension of the uses of these two
indispensible articles, and thus create
a new demand; the other is to produce
less of these and more that must other
wise be purchased. To produce 200
bushels of wheat or two bales of cot
ton and then pay tihe money received
for 100 bushels, or one bale, for arti
cles which could have been more cheap
ly raised at home, is no solution of the
question2-brings no prosperity to the
farmer. 'The extension of commerce
as a means of enlarging the demand,
is a method of solution, only in
directly possible to farmers. The
latter method is easily within the
power of farmers individually and col
lectively. It is a method which any
farmer may test any year, as to its ef
fects upon himself. It is a method
which many have already tested and
found practical and effective. It is a
method which has not failed to remedy
the evils of the so called over-produc
tion. to the estent to which it has been
applied. As long as there are farmers
who will patiently hear a chronic agi
tator advise them to raise what others
want, and buy from others what they
want themselves. in order to stimulate
trade and promote reciprocity, there
will be many who will never adopt the
plan herein recomnedc. The intelligent
and progressive farnmers, here and else
where are adopting, tihe method right
along, because it appeals to common
sense, and presents insatances of sue
cess on every hand.-l'arm and Ranch.
HERE AND THERE.
-W1ell-fed Inogs are generally welb
contented creatures, tlhecrefore it is with
some surprise that we read in the Chli
cago market reports that "fat hogs are
depressed."
-Notwithstanding the low price of
ordinary beef cattle. it. will be noticed
that the price of choice stolk holds its
own. There is room at the Chicago
pens for choice beeves at geo.l prices.
-A fast team will do more plowing
in a day than a slow one. bat very
often the slow steady team is the best.
In many cases, like plowing small corn
or cotton, good work can only be done
slowly.
-Intensive farming means causing
the farm to do its best every year.
WVhat's wrong about that? Book farm
ing means following the methods that
intelligent farmers have shown to ibe
the best. What is wrong with that?
-There is nothing like liberal feed
ing to cure the wool taste of mutton.
If the wool and hide bears an unusual
ly large ratio to the weight of flesh
the latter will have the objectionable
flavor. If the sheep has nothing else
to smell like it will smell like wool.
-While resting preparatory to cot
ton picking, wouldit not ibe well to see
if the barns,. sheds and fences don't
need some attention. Rest doesn't al
ways mean a state of inanition. A
change of occupation is often more re
freshing than a prolonged seating on it
nail keg.
-When a man goes into the dairy
business he is going to get a return
from his investment before twenty
four hours are over-the cow declares
a dividend before night. You don't
have to wait twelve months.
-On every well riegulated farm there
is a place which if not occupied with
sheep is an unoccupied and unprofita
ble hiatus. There is a place for cattle,
hi'ses, hogs and poultry and no one
can till the place of any other. The
food, the care, the habits are all differ
ent. A farm well filled must htIave all
these things. to prevent waste of the
elements of success.
-The farmer who is a dairyman is
stimulated by the quick returns which
come into his pocket each day in time
yeali; lie becomes more of a business
man than other farmers. He-is a mann
uftacturer, and le acquires business
sense and makes that study of the
market which all manufacturers must
have to make them successful.
-Cross-breeding is breeding from
thoroughbred animals of differient
breeds. Grading up is breeding a thor
oughbred sire to common females.
Grading down is using a grade sire on
any sort of female. Grading up is the
sheet anchor of success in stock-rais

-It is a common mistake to suppose
that the veryi richest soil is best to

RECEIVING EXERCISE.
thrkish Bath, Floor Rest and Other Meth
ods Deseribed In Detail.
We American women have at last be
come fully aroused as to the imiportance
of exercise, says a writer, and with
characteristic energy we all-men,
women and children-have gone at it,
and are exercising indoors and out of
doors as hard and fast as ever we can.
This would be a fine thing if our lives
were not quite so full and hurried and
if we were as a people a trifle more
stolid
Unfortunately we have yet to learn
the meaning of the word rest-until we
do, exercise may prove to the majority
of us, a dubious blessing.
Now, why not be exercised? The
Turkish bath is one step in that direc
tion, and the "floor rest" is another.
Any woman who is fortunate enough
to command the services of a lady's
maid, or who can call in an attendant
at stated times, or can secure the co
operation of her own family, can re
ceive exercise instead of exercising.
When a long and hard day or social or
serious duties is before or behind her
this royal way of resting the muscles
and stimulating the respiration is good
and most efficacious.
Have a warm blanket or drugget,
kept especially for this purpose, spread
smoothly on the floor. . Then get into
loose garments and place yourself at
full length on this hard bed for half an
hour's manipulation.
When you lie as limp and indifferent
as a rag baby, your attendant, whom
you have previously instructed, gently
rolls and kneads your body, lifts and
drops and twists and swings your arms
and legs.
The head-the body's fifth limb-re
ceives much the same treatment that is
given the legs and arms, but should be
handled with special gentleness.
Your own duties consist in, first, as
suring yourself that your breathing is
full, free, and controlled by the din
phragm,and then in surrendering your
self to a nirvana-like indifference to
all things.
I happen to know a very pretty wom
an who for some years past has in
dulged herself three or four times
weekly, at bedtime, in this sort of de
licious "first rest." I recall her when
she was a trifle awkward and con
strained in her bearing, but now she is
as joyously free and buoyant in all her
movements as a forest dryad.-N. Y.

A BAD PLAN TO SCOLD.
It Stakes Vomen Grow Older Than Their
Years.
Not long ago a man was seen to t:ake
a big dose of quinine as unconcernedly
as he would have swallowed so much
sugar.
"Mercy!" exclaimed his friend, "how
could you do that?"
"Very easily: I have been accustomed
to it. It happened that I began taking
it about the time I had discovered that
I had married a scold. One dose was
as bitter as the other; now I can
swallow either without giving it a
thought."
Not a very gallant specch, but won
derfully suggestive.
The most deluded mortal in the
world is the w'oman who fancies that
much is gained by scolding, or whining,
or complaining. She may seem to gain
her ends for a while (for at first one
will do most anything to avoid swallow
ing a bitter dose,) but if she would
stop to consider, she would soon dis
cover that every. day she has better
cause for scolding or whining or coin
plaining, whichever method she adopts,
and that, as the month rolls by. an
ever-increasing amount is required to
accomplish the same result.
T'he scolding woman never has things
her own way without a vast expendi
ture of nervous strength-much more
than the object to be gained is worth.
Why can not she realize that and adopt
some pleasanter method?-Philadelphia
Times.
Tien nest SIhampoo.
A dermatologist of hig-h standing says
that the proper way to shampoo the
head is to use some pure soap made into
a "good lather on the head," with
plenty of warmn water, and rubbed into
the scalp with the fingers or with
rather a stiff brush that has long bris
tles. When the scalp is very sensitive,
borax snd water, or the yolks of three
eggs, beaten in a pint of lime water,
are recommended instead of soap and
water. After rubbing the head thor
oughly in every direction, and washing
put the hair with plenty of warm water,
Sor with douches of warm water, alter
nating with cold. drying the hair with
a bath towel, a small quantity of vas
eline or sweet almond oil should be
rubbed into the scalp. The oil thus ap
plied is used in the place of the oil that
has been removed by washing, and to
prevent the hair from becoming brittle.
