startling. There must have been
radical mismanagement on the part
of the board of control of the endow I

million of dollars could not have oc

been discovered and punishment in

justification or extenuation for the
misapplication or the misappropria

man or men guilty of crime, if it be
in this instance, should be sent for:

it has been reported by telegram
from Cleveland, 0, that a number of
Democrats. resisting the action of the
I)emocratlc State convention In re
gard to Mr Bryan, are preparing to
bolt Welll it these and otbers
should, they will simply be following
in the footsteps of the Buckners and
the Palmers, who were landed in
fulsome praise as patriots by some
of the press and so-called leaders
now abusing Mr Bryan. But, unlike
tbe Buckners and the Palmers, Mr
Bryan has not aided in the election of
a Bei:ublian president, but he is
urging the Democrats of Ohio to
rally and stand together and defeat
the Republicau.
It is no wonder John R McL.an
aided and abetted nla the political as

as ambitions. He has been and as
now a candidate for President. To
get rid of Bryan then is the policy
ot the McLeans and the Johbsons of

A .se'stlol of Color.
,In the South Carolina legislature the
president of the senate and the speaker
of the house wear silk robes while pre
siding over their respective houses.
This custom Is nearly a century old.
and its origin is somewhat obscure.
Present attention to the matter arises
from a change in the color of the robes
from the original ultramarine blue.
Over this the South Carolina papers
are Justly agitated. At one time, far
distant, the robe was red. instead of
blue, but both dolors are those of the
national flag and either. In the South
Carolina view. is preferable to the robe
of royal purple donned by the speaker
at the recent session, the gown of
belHotrope gracefully worn by the presi
dent of the senate. There was evident
need for new robes, as It is learned
from the Charleston Post that the one
worn at this session by the speaker
was a successor to one made for
Speaker James Slmons in 1839 at a
cost of $1,200. That robe, as shown in
a portrait of Speaker 81mons, was blue,
and The Post asks that that color.
which has some historical associations,
be fxed by statute. Otherwise It fears
that the house may some day have a
speaker wearing a yellow Jacket and a
peacock feather like Li Hung Chang.

EVERYTHING QUIET.
Ire Ololial of Bothk Sdes Are ConS
deut *t a Settlement.
Pittsburg, July 17.-No new develop
mnents in the great steel strike in this
district during the early hours of the
second day. All plantesloed yesterday
were shut down tight and matters about
the Paints mill, Lindsay, MeOutcheon,
Olarks, Solar Iron works, Monongehala
and Star Tin Plate plants are quiet. It
is stated the Painters mill is in partial
operation, but the men at work were a
few Hungarians oleaning up about the
yards.
Replying to a rumor that the man
igement had brought a strike breaker
from Alabama, Assistant General Man
ager Harper msaid:
"We can break our own strikes."
Superintendent Albreoht was met en
oountered a few moments later, said
the plant would be running in full
within a few days.
Speculation as to the probable settle
ment of the strike is active in all circles
and among the business men and man
afaoturers generally the ooncenmus of
opinion is the combine officials and
amalgamated offiials will get together
before long and adjust differences. Some
manufacturerers were emphatio in stat
ing it will be arranged within 48 hours,
yet they could give no positive infor
mation of any movement on foot to
_artd the negotiations.
In regard to the threat of President
ihafer to call oat the workmen in
other union plants of the United States
eel corporaation made Saturday, a sig
siscamt statement from him was to the
feotthat just now he is not in the
ympathetio strike business, is looked
spon as meaning that for the present
the me will be allowed to continue at
work.
About 19,000 skilled workmen are
t at present. It is estimated the un
Ikillsd labor in the various mills affeot
sd by the strike will run a total close
o the claim of 74,000 idle men, made
by the Amalgamated mesciatiion.

New York, July 17.-The last has not
he.n hea:tr i of military oensorship in
England not withstandingGeueral Kitch
ener's blunt telegram, according to the
London correspondent of the Tribune.
While the Boer commandoes, the dis
patch says, may be so demoralized and
scattered that neither Generals Botha or
Do Wet can put an end to atrocities such
as the massacre of the wounded if their
attention be called to them, the public
has a right to know what is going on
and especially when the pro-Boers on
the continent and in Euglani are charg
ing the British army with conducting
an inhuman campaign. This is the
opinion of the English press, which has
united in cond -mning the military ar
rangements for keeping the country in
ignorance of the real nature of the war
fare now in progress.
Details of General French's combined
attack upon Scheaper's stronghold are
still meager, but the results were evi
dently not so complete as had been ex
pected in the employment of a series of
columns working toward a common
goal. The mail force escaped and Gen.
French will have to set another trap.
Reports that a large body of British in
fantry will be sent home and that the
railway between Johanesburg and Dur
ban will be the only one occupied in
strength, are not credited by military
men. This would involve the practical
abandonment of the line between Blom
fontein and Johannesburg and would
be regarded by the Boers as a British
retreat and a confession of failure.
OHIO BANK ROBBED.

villagers. Finally the bandits fled in
two rigs which had been previously
stolen. The sheriff aud posse are now

New Yo,rk, July 17.-Obeying to a
man the strike order, 30,000 nembers of
the Amalgamated Association of Iron
Workers, Steel and Tin Workers, struck
Monday for revoguition of their union.
From West Virginia to Illinois every
mill of the steel hoop, sheet steel and

mustered any strength was forced to
shut down, and 20.000 to 30,000 other
workers were thrown out of emnploymen ,.
The greatest coup of the strikers was
In compelliig the closing of two big
steel hoop mills in Pittsburg, all of
which have been non-union up to a few
days ago. Aggressive action against
other non-union mills is threatened by
the jubilant association leaders. A se
cret meeting of the sheet steel managers
was held in Pittsburg and rumors of a
oompromize or mediation were quietly
started. President Shaffer says he is
willing to hold another conference at
any time, but it is generally felt that a
long struggle is ahead.
