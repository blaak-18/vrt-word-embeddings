WhITE SUPREMACY.
The Democratic Party
Doesn't Want It.
The People's party of this par
ish on last Friday had an oppor
tunity of testing the desire of the
Democratic party for white su
premacy.
There are many people yet
clinging to the Democratic party
who honestly believe in white su
premacy and who have made many
sacrifices for that principle. Such
were the three estimable gentle
men appointed as a sub-committee
from the Democrats last Friday
to treat with us, and there were
others.
These honest citizens give the
ring bosses no little trouble when
an honest offer is made to them to
settle the vexing question in a
friendly, effective and law-abiding
manner.
On such occasions It requires
considerable ingenuity and gall to
oppose these honest propositions,
and at the same time retain the
confidence of those who really de
sire white supremacy.
If white supremacy were really
settled the masses would get to
gether on real live issues, and the
"profesh" in politics would be
knocked out. So the "profesh"
don't want any question settled
save the one that they are to re
turn to office.
On last Friday the "profesh"
and hs bosses were put to their
wits end by an honest, simple
proposition from the People's par
ty to do, most effectually, the very
thing the Democratic party has
hypocritically been clamoring for
-secure white suoremacv.
The Populists proposed the fol
lowing :
Proposition to the Democratic par
ty of Natchitoches parish, La.,
by the People's party of same
parish.
1st. The People's party offers
to submit its entire parish and
ward tickets to the white legal vo
ters of the parish against the par
ish and ward tickets of the Demo
cratic party of said parish m a
primary election.
2nd. Said primary election to
be equally arranged and controll
ed by the two parties herein agree
ing.
3rd. We pledge the People's
party of this parish, its press,
speakers and nominees to abide
by the result of said primary.
4th. We are ready to arrange
details of said primary with a sim
liar sub-committee vested with
authority from the Democratic ,
executive committee.
8. J. IZnKy, Chairman.
H. L. Bax, Secretary.

Who is the Populist Nomi
nee for Governor.
Two weeks ago we asserted in
this paper that the State Central
Committee of the People's party
did not take Mr. Booth down.
We said this in reply to Booth's
supporters, who charged it and
denied the conmmittee's authority,
and the committee's published ad
dress bore us o:lt in the assertion.
The Booth contingent caught at
this "dying man's straws" to claim
that Booth is still our nominee.
We regret to take away the last
straw to which they are so devout
ly clinging, but knowing that a
good stout boat is within easy reach
of them, we have no fear of their
drowning, and so we knock out
their last ballast.
'Tis true, the new ticket was
submitted subject to the approval
and support of the partial ticket
made by the convention (not to
Mr. Booth's approval alone).
Now the new ticket has received
the approval and support of, not
only every man on the convention
ticket save Booth, but 3-fourths
of our press and 3-fourths the
people as well-two Populist par
ishes having met and denounced
the Executive Committee, and eigh
teen having met and indorsed the
new ticket.
Mi. Booth and two parishes
alone stand out against the mani
fest will of the party in the State
and their own better judgment.
The great bulk of our party,
its press and its original nominees
having ratified the work of the
committee, it certanly becomes
regular and right, and Capt. J.
N. Pharr is the Populist nominee
for Governor of Louisiana.

The People's party parish com
mittee met at noon in the Court
house in this city, Thursday, 20th
inst.
Chairman Henry called the
meeting to order, and a roll call
showed 6 wards represented.
Chairman stated objects of meet
mg to be the election of a member
of the State Campaign Committee,
to outline the parish campaign, and
other business.
On motion, Mr. J. W. Jones
was elected member of State Cam
paign Committee.
On motion, Chairman S. J. Hen
ry, Secretary H. L. Brian, and
Jno. IV. Brown, were appointed to
carry out the instructions of ourl
parish nominating convention, held I
October 8th, 1595, with reference
to offering the Democratic party a
white primary.
OUR DAILY.
The N. .0. Daily Item, which
now has the largest circulation in
New Orleans of any paper in the
State, and is fast becoming the
leading paper of this State, because
of its fight against the Fitzpatrick I
ring of boodlers in the city at
first, but aganst the Foster-Fitz
patrick combine in the State now, t
is takiang up the light for the Pharr t
ticket, which it considers the only
sensible way to oppose Foster and
Fits.
To lead a wiinning fight, the t
Daily Item will add much to the I
marked improvements already 1
made in the paper.
An able corps of writers aad i
correapondents have been secured, -

Is it from the fact that the man

I vocate the principles of Democra
cy on the financial question f Is
- it from the fact that the convention
that nominated the ticket voted

I put in the platform ? Is it from
the fact that this convention in
t dorsed the administration of the
"besotted" tyrant who by "party
.perfidy and party dishonor" and
sordid avarice has hopelessly
r wrecked the Democratic party, and
t brought distress upon millions of
the peolplet Is it from the fact
3 that IDmn;ocrats should strive to
1 elevate to places of honor and trust
those claiming to be Democrats,
ยบ who in this greed for spoils, have
espoused the cause of the Pluto
I cratic Conspirators I Is it from
t the fact, that those parties, who
boast of their fealty to white su
a premacy, honest government, &c.,
are now bidding for the negro vote,
by repudiating that plank in their
I platform, which they proclaimed
in "trumlpet tongue" would I!rmln
about "the consumation So devout
ly to be wished for." Is it from
the fact that these parties have si
lenced the advocacy of the silver
issue, the denunciation ot the bondl
dicker, &c.; by the D)emocratic
press throughout the State of Lou
isian, deeming it best for the dear
people, that thesw and all other
question be kept quiet and out of
politics until those seeking office,
can dance the lliland Fling to the
music a-La-Turner of Ga., "He's
in the new divide, where Wall
street gold is gleaning-you've
landed on the shore." Is it from
the fact that these parties have an
nounced that they have discovered
the "mailed hand" of Ethiopia
reaching to grasp the reins of our
State government, unless Goldites,
Cleveland Democrats, be placed in
power? Is it from the fact that
these parties poseess a magic elec
tion machine, by which a minority
vote can be transformed into an
overwhelming majority.
JOSEPH P. WEEKS.
F. M.; Will you please state in
your column : What or who is a
Democrat on principlel What or
who is a Republican on principle?
I have had occasion to ask the
question of many Democrats and
publicans, and why they are
such. I have also asked the same
question from several so-called
ward leaders, and never have I re
ceived an answer satisfactorily
explaining the difference between
a Democrat and a Republican.
None ever explained where or why
their principles differ.
The principles of a party are al
ways expreseed in its platform.
Years back there was a most deci
ded difference between the two par
ties. The Democratic party be
lieved in State rights, free trade,
or at least, tariff for revenue only;
opposed internal improvements by
the general government, objected
to national banking, and, as a rule,
was pro-slavery in sentiment.
The Republicans, on the contra
ry, were advocates for a more oen
tral or Federal government, were
protectionist or high tariff party,
believed in internal improvements
by the general government, were
in favor of national banking and
anti-slavery men.
Many of the issues have been
settled by time, and now the only
decided difference is on the ques
tion of tariff or protection, and
the finsncial policy of the country,
haq been settled up and largely in
creased in population and area, and
ditereat interests are being ยทaect
ed, it an be safely maid that in both
parties there is not that uanaimity
at sentiment that existed of old,
on these points . An Eastern
Wetern )Demoert take difer
eat views on these subjects, and so
with the Eastern and Weetern Re
pubilcan. -
Asa example, the Masachao

a "We oppose the free coinage oi
"r silver and any further purchase o1
;, silver bullion on government ac
n count."
Lt The Michigan Democratic plat
form reads : "The Democratic par.
Y ty in Michigan assembled haih
with delight the rapidly-increasing
sentiment in favor of the restora
tion of silver to the position it &c
long held in the monetary system
of our country, and unqualified.
ly declares in favor of the free and
r unlimited coinage of silver and
e gold with full legal tender power
El at a ratio of 16 to 1, etc."
The New Jersy Democrats in
l dorse the policy of the administra
- tion, "whose determination to pro
Y tect the people of this country
from the evils ever attendant upon
a debasement of the national cur
rency."
Ohio Democrats say : "We hold
to the use of both gold and silver
- without discrimination of either
metal or charge for mintage."
New York Democrats declare:
- "No free and unlimited coinage of
, silver.0
Massachusetts Republicans af
firm that the government should
maintain each dollar which it is
sues on par with its standard gold
' dollar, and should not permit the
free coina' of silver at any ratio
not established by international
agreement, while Ohio Republi
cans announce: "We favor bimet
alism and demand the use of both
gold and silver as standard mon
a ey." So you can see that the Dem
crats and Republicans of Massa
chusetts and New York agree,
1 while the Democrats of the above
States disagree with the Democrats
of Ohio, Mississippi and other
States, and the case is the same on
the Republican side--the only real,
"positive issue between the two
I parties (excepting some minor is
sues and the great race issue which
the Republicans have practically
dropped) is the question of tarif,
and even that is affected by certain
- interests in certain States--Times
IDemocrat.
The above is the answer given in
the Times-Democrat, the leading
i Democratic paper of our State.
" We call our Populists attention to
the fact that the Times-Democrat
cannot find any difference between
the two old parties, now we would
like for our neighbor, the Enter
:prise, to give us the difference.
I We feel certain they know more
than the Times-Democrat, and will
find plenty to howl about.
