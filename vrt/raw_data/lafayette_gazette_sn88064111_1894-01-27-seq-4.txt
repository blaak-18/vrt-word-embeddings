Has discovered in one of our common
psturreeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the orst Srofula
downto a fcommon Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit is always experienced from
the first bottle, and a perfect cure is war

When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains, like needles passing
throuh them; the same with the Lier or

GARDEN AND ORCHARD. t
PLAN trees as deep as they grow in 1
the nursery.
TaE chief value in dwarf pears is
their early bearing.
DwAnR pears require a light soil and
a light pruning every spring.
MuLCHInm is of benefit, whether the
planting is done early or late.
A DERP soil is necessary to a good
garden, but care must be taken not to
bring to the surface too much subsoil 1
DEAD branches on fruit and other l
trees are not only unsightly, but they I
are a draft on the vitality of the tree. I
rorxxs set-out in rthe fall should be
well mulched as soon as the ground I
freezes hard enough to bear up a s
wagon. IF
TREEs set out in the fall should be I
carefully mulched as soon as the
ground freezes hard enough to bear up
a wagon.
Ix removing dead branches care
should be taken to make the cut closo
and smooth. If a stub is left it will I
not heal over readily.
THE wild cherry is the home of the
tent caterpillar. The safest remedy is
to cut off and burn infested branches
as soon as they make their appearance. I
BEN DAVIs, Grimes' golden. Stark,
wintersweet, Paradise, Stewart's gol
den, Fink's rambo, and quite a list of l
standard apples are said to bear gener
ally in the even numbered years.
ONxi or two careless fruit growers in
a neighborhood will keep up a supply
of the tent caterpillar to infest all the
orchards for a mile or two around. It
is only by thorough, earnest work that1
they can be eradicated.
Tns cherry is less troublesome to
grow than almost any other kind of
fruit. All that is necessary is to plant
out the trees carefully and then let
them alone. Cultivation is really an
injury, by inducing a too spreading
growth.
As soon as the ground freezes apples I
and vegetables that are pulled out 1
should have a covering of coarse ma-n
nure, straw or other coarse litter as
extra protection during the winter.
The windows of the cellar should bo
closed up.-St. Louis Republic.
THE eggs of the tent caterpillar are
laid in clusters on shoots of rather less
than half an inch in diameter and are
fastened tpgether with a kind of glue 1
that protects them from the weather.
As they are easily seen in winter the
best plan is to cut off all infested
branches and burn them.
THE FARM ORCHARD.
It Addls Mch to the Attractiveness oZ
Country Life.
If you own-a piece of land, even if it
does not contain more than five act us,
plant a portion of it to fruit. In a
small orchard it is a good plan to alter
nate apple and peach trees. In this
way you can plant trees much closer
together, as the peach trees will have
died before the apple trees are large
enough to interfere with them. Don't
plant apple trees closer than two rods
of each other. If you. do you will find
you have made a mistake before they
are half-grown. Plums, apricots and
cherries may be planted twenty feet
apart. It will be a long time before
they crowd each other. Standard pears
should have five feet more room e:ach
way. I don't favor planting du arf
fruit trees. They bear early and die
early. This may be done in a . ew
country, where fruit is scarce and land
is cheap. It is a good plan to cultivtce
a young orchard. MIanure welL Plr.nt
small fruits (for the first five years) be
tween the rows, leaving it so you can
plow one way, especially where the
tract is small and land is dear. -Far m
ers' Voice.
A Self-Suckring Cow.
The nuisance of having a cow with
this vice is such as to make it almost
useless, and, unless the cow is a good
one, it would be better to make the
animal into beef than to worry with it.
If the cow, however, is worth Jieeping
in spite of this bad habit, it may be
controlled in this way: The head is
fitted with a common headstall, having
a strong ring under the jaws. A strap
is worn by the cow around th r body
immediately behind the shoulders. A
A ring is fitted on this strap under the
brisket A stout hickory or oak rod,
having a snap hook at each end, is then
fastened to the rings and passed be
tween the fore legs, so that the cow
can feed, but cannot reach her udder.
he Cam of Orchareds.
The only way to keep up an orchard
is to plant some trees every year. Most
people neglect this, and when they do
plant the trees they set them too close
together, so that the roots intertwne
I and fruit production is checked. Ap
Sple trees should be set at least thirty
1 feet apart each way. rt is a mistake to
imagine an orchard will take care of it
self. Trees require the Attention of
the owner just as weJlla stock or farn
crops, and negieet will be reiOad in the
same fashion. If you aire not willing
