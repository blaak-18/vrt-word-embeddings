THE GENUINE
DR C. .ELANE's
Celebrated American
WORM SPECIFIC
OR
VERMIFUGE.
SYMPTOMS OF WORMS.
THE countenance is pale and lead.
en-colored, with occasional flushes,
or a circumscribed spot on one or both
cheeks; the eyes become dull: the
pupils dilate; an azure semicircle
runs along the lower eye-lid; the
nose is irritated, swells, and sometimes
bleeds; a swelling of the upper lip;
occasional headache, with humming
or throbbing of the ears; an unusual
secretion of saliva; slimy or furred
tongue; breath very foul, particularly
in the morning; appetite variable.
sometimes voracious, with a gnawing
sensation of the stomach, at others,
entirely gone; fleeting pains in the
stomach; occasional nausea and vom
iting; violent pains throughout the
abdomen; bowels irregular, at times
costive; stools slimy, not unfrequent
ly tinged with blood; belly swollen
and hard: urine turbid; respiration
occasionally difficult, and accompa
nied by hiccough; cough sometimes
dry and convulsive; uneasy and dis
turbed sleep, with grinding of the
teeth; temper variable, but generally
irritable, &c.
Whenever the above symptoms
are found to exast,
DR. C. McLANE'S VERMIFUGE
will certainly effect a cure.
