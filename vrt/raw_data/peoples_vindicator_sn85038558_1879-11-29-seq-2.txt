A few luninformed individuals are
urging as reasons for not voting for
Wilts, that he did not represent the
people and their wishes at the time
of the'dificulty between the MeEoe
ry and Kellogg goverument. Lst us
1879 go beek and briefly review l he bisto
- ry of those troublesome thisa. Two
O thirds of the voters of the city elect.
ed him for the second time Mayor,
and they expeoted him to be the lm.
partial, law*abiding Chief Magistrate i
of the people, and not of a party. )
They required of him a non-partisan
corse, sayingthat that their necessites
were such that nothing but thbis 1
would satisfy the demands of the
people. He fully answered their ez
peotatlon.
It has been said that Mayor Wilts I
and his Council went to Pinebbaeck
and ass their Commissions. The it
statement is inorrect in this partle- o
ular. It bad been determined by the e
ruling powers to prevent the nlastalla
tion of Mayor Wilts and his Council, g
and to establish an usurpatory city u
government, as well asan usurpato. ti
ry State government, and had Wilts 9
been ecotent with aoermr, the ef- t
fort would have been suessful. But we
he resolved, however, upon a more
resolute plan of action. He went to
the City HBall, entered the Mayor's pt
Ofe and peremptorily demanded to
of Mayor Flanders, surrounded by 01
his retainers, the surrender of the
al city government. Mayor Flanders as
or essnn, affirmed that high legal at'
authorities sustained him In refusing (
to abdicate, and begged for nr. toi
Wilts coolly drew his watch from his tb
pocket and told him he would just
give him rtas minutes. At the expi.
ration of thatime, Wilts without a lo
Commision from any power, and on
solely upon the AUTOnaTr of the o
vora of the 1yor= who had elected
him, proclaimed himself Mayor, and
took possession of the Mayor's ooce, ]
Installed the Administrators, and or- .a
dared his Secretary to take charge of oat
the arebieves of the city. FPlly a al
T meath after all of this, Painchbek, fe
acting Governor, offered, of his ows he
i moo3, the Commission to Mayor (
Wlts, andit was accepted. The - so I
0 eptaneo at the tim was right and nai
proper, for had it ot been done, the to
Scity gouernment would have gone Los
into the hands of the Radicals.
IJ this he acted for the good of
Sthe ity, ad with the advioe and ap
Sprobatlon of able juriste, and the T
most patriotle of his blrends. T

is old friends and comrades in this
hour of trial, when the hand of every
1. true friend of liberty and the righ's
o, of mankind $should be rti~tel in Ide
ft. ense of those great aid goi ious
principles which have given u, our
liberry and freedom, and which prom
lie so much for our prosperity in the
future, the grand and glorious prin.
ciplesof Democracy. Have ye for.
gotten, co(mrades, our great trial?
Have ye forgotten those long, weary
and gloomy years, when ruit and
starvation stared us in the face?
Have ye forgotten the long, bitter
r and almost hopeless fight of twelve
i years? Have ye forgotten the thriving
rule of Blunt. Baby, Lawld, Breda,
Barron and Myeri ? Hfav ye for
gotten our trials orf scarce six mont ha
ago, when Shederlek Brown, Breda,
Merity. Green and a host of others.
attempted to swear away the lives of
our best and most loyal citizens?
Have ye so soon forgotten all this
that you still cling to a political fe.
tion that can boast of these very men
as members ? Shame on ye who dio
this. Let us remember the 21st of
September. of 1878, that glorious day
when the Sux of LIBERTY once more
dawned upon our beloved State,
floodling with resplendent light our
path to glory, honor and prosperity.
Remember this, comrades, and array
yourself in the ranksof Democra y,
and if FATE has so decreed, snu we
are beat on the second day of Decem

Dear Sir-After suffering for thirty
er, years from a running necer In the ear
er, occasioned by a wagon passing on my
head and after having been operated
ulpon by Dr. Logan in New Orleans and
and not being eured, I tried some of your
balm and lainm happy to say that after a
few applicationsot it I got entirely well
'd. and was radically cured.
ve A negro boy on my place cut his foot
Id with allow and it was thoughtonce
r- that it would have to be amputated but
,- after applying your balm on the wound
t. for a few days it healed up and the boy
is now well. Again, George Cole, a
neighbor of mine, whilst shooting a gun,
a piece of the cap flew in his eye, we
tried the balm again and with suceess.
His eye got well after two applications
of the balm.
I conclude by stating that in my opin.
ion your balm is an invaluable medicine
and I will take pleasure in recommend.

Very respectfully,

and in a very short time effected a cure.
The old woman is now well and able to
testify to the same.
