Chairman Hollalvay Issues Address
We, the Executive Committee of
the People’s party of Georgia, feel
that we would be recreant to the
trust reposed in us, did we not sound
a note of warning to the white voters
of Georgia.
There is a very unnatural align
ment being formed in Georgia, which
is being promoted by some of those
who were dissatisfied with the nom
ination of Joseph M. Brown, which
threatens white supremacy in Geor
gia, and seeks to lessen Hon. Thomas
E. Watson’s majority in the Novem
ber election.
This is not mere guess work upon
our part, for the press which is giv
ing the principal support to this
scheme, furnishes ample proof of the
truth of these assertions, even if we
had no others.
The fact that an administration
which went into power on the dis-
Letter From Judge Williams
Vincennes, Ind., Aug. 25, 1908.
Editor Jeffersonian:
I take the following clipping from
a press dispatch in a democratic pa
per of this date:
“It was announced at headquarters
that Thomas FI. Tibbles, who ran
with Thomas Watson as Vice Presi
dential candidate on the Populist tick
et in 1904, has written to the commit
tee that he is urging all his friends
in the Populist party to support Bry
an. ”

JUDGE SAMUEL W. WILLIAMS.
The headquarters referred to, as
shown by the context, is the Bryan
headquarters. The dispatch is from
Chicago. This is the same Tom Tib
bles who has been several times kick
ed out of the People’s Party. The
same Tom who at Denver in 1904 .
signed a written pledge known to his
tory as the ‘‘Denver Agreement,” by
the terms of which he solemnly prom
ised never to vote anything but a
straight People’s party ticket.
This is the same Tom who was, lat
er in the same year, at the St. Louis
conference justly and properly lam
basted and exposed by Mr. Burkhart
of Indiana.
Populists Are Urged to Pally to Their Standard Nearer—
Thomas E. Watson—Organize is the Watchlvord
franchisement issue has changed the
disfranchisement law which was to
go into effect on adoption in October,
so as to make it not effective till
1909, admits of no other reasonable
construction than that it is intend
ed to use the purchasable negro vote
to trim Mr. Watson’s majority.
Nothing is clearer than the fact that
ours is not only the true Jefferson
ian party, but that it is the white
man’s party.
Therefore, we want to say to the
1 ‘ Old Guard,” who have kept the
faith through many defeats, to cheer
up, because we already know of many
strong and true men who are flock
ing to our standard; men who have
He there confessed his past infamy
and double dealing and shed tears
while begging forgiveness and swear
ing upon his sacred honor (?) that
he would be straight in the future.
This is the same Tom who in the
Hoffman House in July, 1904, admit
ted, in presence of Mr. Watson, my
self and others, that he had gone into
a conspiracy by which Chairman Fer
riss was to be forced to resign and our
national organization sold out to cer
tain New York parties.
This is the same Tom who, while
pretending all the time to be a popu
list, has for 20 years been a stool
pigeon and spy for William J. Bryan.
This is the same Tom who, in 1896
assisted in the seduction of the Peo
ple’s party and the betrayal of Thom
as E. Watson.
This is the same Tom who went to
Sioux Falls in 1900 and posed as a
populist in the sickly and mangy ag
gregation assembled there under the
auspices of the democratic machine
which resulted in an abortion under
the hand of Senator Jones of Arkan
sas.
This is the same Tom who pretend
ed to start a People’s party newspa
per in Nebraska for national circula
tion in 1895 and collected subscrip
tions over the country for five years
in advance and then failed to send
the paper or to answer letters of in
quiry.
This is the same Tom who tra
duced, abused and opposed Hon. Igna
tius Donnelly in 1900.
This is the same Tom who assisted
in destroying the People’s party or
ganization in Nebraska.
This is the same Tom who, while
always pretendihg to belong to the
People’s party, never voted its tick
et in his life.
This is the same Tom whose nomi
nation was obtained for Vice Presi
dent at Springfield by fraud and de
ceit and who did not support the tick
et even when he was a part of it.
This is the same Tom whose record
'3kfl r ersoixiati
are now ready to fall in line with us
and help bear the colors which you
have so nobly kept from trailing in
the dust.
Therefore we appeal to every true
Populist to proceed at once to organ
ize our forces in every county and
every precinct in Georgia.
Write today for enrollment blanks
if you have not already done so, and
see that every believer in Jeffersonian
principles in your precinct is en
rolled.
We have the blanks now ready
which gives the county, post office
and route number of each signer,
which you will find will make a con
venient mailing list, and greatly aid
was fully shown up in the national
conference in the dining room of the
St. James Hotel in 1906.
This is the same Tom who is known
by every Old Guard Populist in the
United States to be a Hessian and a
renegade.
Tom means that if he' had any
friends in the Populist party this year
he would tell them to vote for Bry
an, but he has none.
The populists all know Tom and
the more he talks the harder the pop
ulists will fight Bryan.
This is the same Tom who was
hissed out of the People’s Party Na
tional Convention at St. Louis in
1908.
This is the same Tom who, in 1896,
tried to betray Governor Thomas
Wadsworth and the balance of the
People’s Party ticket in Indiana.
This is the same Tom who never
again will be permitted to take part
in a Populist convention.

SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPLES
OF JEFFERSONIAN
DEMOCRACY.
Money.
The issuance of money is a func
tion of government and should not be
delegated to corporations or individ
uals. We demand that all money be
issued by the government direct to
the people and shall be full legal ten
der for all debts.
Land.
Alien ownership of the public do
main should be forbidden. Lands held
by aliens or by corporations who have
violated the conditions of their grants,
should be restored to the public do
main.
Trusts and Monopolies.
The Government should own and
control railroads and public utilities
which in their nature are monopolies,
including telephone, telegraph sys
tems, parcels post and postal savings
banks. We demand withdrawal of all
special privileges from other trusts
not been with us heretofore, but who
us in mailing out tickets for the elec
tion. For the blanks write to J. J.
Hollaway, Clem, Ga., or to J. E.
Bodenhamer, Atlanta, Ga.
Do not forget to enclose a few
stamps, and contribute whatever you
feel able to spare for expenses of
campaign in mailing out and printing
literature, tickets, etc.
Every penny will be accounted for
and used for legitimate expenses on-
Iv.

Arrange meetings and write to
headquarters for literature and
speakers when needed, and every
thing possible will be done to assist
you.

Chairman, Clem, Ga.
J. E. BODENHAMER,
■Secretary, Atlanta, Ga.
and monopolies and that they be sub
ject to such governmental regulation
and control as will adequately protect
the public.
Initiative and Referendum.
We recommend a federal statute
that will recognize the principles of
the Initiative and Referendum and
thereby restoring to the voters the
right to instruct their representatives.
Labor.
We believe in the right of laborers
to organize for their mutual protec
tion and benefit, and condemn the re
cent attempt to destroy the power of
trades unions through the unjust use
of federal injunctions. We demand
the abolition of child labor, convict
labor and exclusion of foreign pauper
labor. We demand the enactment of
an employe’s liability act within con
stitutional bounds and favor the open
ing of public work to laborers in times
of depression and enforced idleness.
We congratulate the farmers upon
their splendid organizations.
Courts.
We condemn all unwarranted as
sumption of authority by inferior fed
eral courts in annulling by injunc
tions the laws of the states
and demand action by con
gress which will inhibit such usurpa
tion and will restrict to the Supreme
Court of the United States the exer
cise of such power in cases involving
State legislation. We are opposed to
gambling in futures.
AN EPIDEMIC.
Every employe of the Bank of Eng
land is required to .sign his name in
a book on his arrival in the morn
ing, and if late, must give the reason
therefor. The chief cause of tardi
ness is usually fog, and the first man
to arrive writes “fog” opposite his
name, and those who follow write
“ditto.” The other day, however,
the first late man gave as the rea
son, “wife had twins,” and twenty
other late men mechanically signed
“ditto” underneath. —The Argonaut.
