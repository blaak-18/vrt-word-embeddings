Fault Finders,
[I om the ew (Orleans h;nlletiu.
One of the peculiarities of,1' New Or
leans journalisin is the snathber of
"owtsiders" who make it lheil special
business to "sit upon" and to severe
ly criticise the course of the various
newspapers published in New Orleans,
although in the nutijoity of cases
most of these self-constituted judges
know little or nothing of the business,
and would be just as Inuich at sea if
put i,, charge of a daily or even a
weekld journal, as they would be re
qilired to give sailing directions on
board of a vessel bound for Hong
Kong of Calcutta.
For instance, A is a commission
merchant, or a broker in good stand
iig, andl doubtless knows all about
Ihis particular branch of business. He'
th!ink his morning paper should de
vote column after column to the stat
lities of trade, the fluctuations of
State., municipal, or 'ffancy" stocks
alnd bonds, and aschew politics alto
gether. A's contribution toward the
support of the obnoxious journal is
probably limited to his yearly sub
scription, which, as every member of
the profession well knows, scarcely
pays for the blank paper upon which
the said journal is printed, Yet he
expects that in making up its con
tents his own particular wishes and
preferences should be extensively, if
not exclusively consulted.
.B, on the other hand, is a gentle
man of elegant (or inelegant) leisure,
who devotes his valuable time and
energies to public affairs. He is to
be heard whenever local politics are
mooted, and looms up imposingly at
all ward meetings and parish or State
nominating conventions. He has his
likes and dislikes within "the party,"
however, and expects the journal
honored with his valuable patronaige
to stand up invariably for the former,
and to denounce tie latter without
stint or mercy. , His eontribution to
the halpless newspaper, whose course
he would fain direct, generally takes
the shape of a stirring appeal to the
voters of his ward to come and "ral
ly"-the said appeal being generally
bestowed oopn Ihis chosen organ, on
the Micawber principle, and settled
for on the same liberal, but unprefit
able basis. B's hostility, nevertheless,
is quite as much to be dreaded as his
friendship, as he is the center of an
admiring circle who take the law
from him, and never fails to denounce
as traitors all who happen to di'eet
with him as to the immense impor
tance of securing Snooks as deputy
street-sweeper or Simkins as assis
taut supervisor of nuisance wharves.
It is C's misfortune to be a great
property-holder, and as a necessary
sequence a heavily taxed citizen. He
does not read the papers much-in
fact, he feels that they do not peform
their duty according to hIns idea, anul
being aggrieved thereat, seldom if
ever wastes a nickel in that direction ;
but should any one connected with a
daily newspaper lend a willing ear to
his complaints, and undertake to put
them into print, he will graciously
condescend to buy a couple of the
copies in which his ideas are embo
died, and perhaps speak patronizing
ly of the journal whose conductor had
the brains to adopt them--"ouly this,
and nothing more !"
D's hobby is the abatement of all
abbuses and nuisances, incltiding
a therein a great many persons things
r which only look so to his jaundiced
vision. If you modestly call his at
tention to the fact that Smith's enter
prise, to which he strongly objects,
(on public grounds of course), is one
whose merits many people recognize,
and thalt by attacking Smnith's uns
iess, you will lose his advertising
support and that of all his fiiends
without receiving the slightest com
pensating patronage from D or his
set, you are at once plit down by
those disinterested censors as mter
cenary scribblers, who dare not fight
any abuse whenever their private in
terests are at stake.
E is a politician, and so long as the
paper panders to his peculiar ideas,
so long as his political hobbies are
praised and he held up to the world
ias a great stateman anrd profoulnd
philosopher, he will deign to invest
in a copy and read with evident gusto
to the compliments showered too of
ten upon himself; but alas for that
journal if it presumes to criticise his
conduct or impugn the wisdom of his
course. He shutteth up his heart and
his purse like a jack knife, and almost
annihilates the luckless newsboy who
proffers him the paper next day, as
with withering scorn hle demands a
copy of some other journal that has
not yet salted him down. All of
which, while it strengthens our belief
in the old saying about the shoemaker
and his last also reminds us of the
inapplicability of the equally ven
erable adage about the amount of
wisdom to be gathered from a nmulti
tude of advisers, particularly when
they belong to the class whose num
ber, according to scripture, "is in
finite."
Spend Your Money at Home.
Au exchange gives the following
ten reasons why people should spend
their money at home. They are so
forcible and well put that we cannot
refrain from presenting them to our
readers, hoping that they will give
them the consideration which they
deserve:
1st. It is your home; you cannot
improve it much by taking money
away to spend or invest.
2d. There is no way of improving
-1 place so much as by encouraging a
good merchants, good schoots, and
good people to settle among you ant1
this cannot be done unless you spend
your money at home.
3,. Spend your money at home,
because there is where you generally
get it. It is your duty.
4th. Spend your money at home, I
B'ccanse when it is necessary for you
to get credit, it is of your town iter- I
chants you have generally to get it,
and they must wait for the money. i
Therefore, when you have the cash I
in hand spend it at home.
5th. Spend your money at home.
It will make better merchants'of your
merchants; they can and will keep I
better assortments and sell at lower I
rates than if the only business they
can do is what is credited out, while
the money goes to other places.
6th. Spend your money at home.
You may have sons growing up who
will sonle day be the best merchants
in town. Help lay the foundations of ,
them now. It is a duty. It may bie
youe pride in after years to say: "By ,
my trading at the store I got my son ,
a position as clerk, and now hie is a
proprietor." Then you will think it ,
hard if your neighbors spend their
money out of town. Set the exam
pie now.
7th. Spend your money at home.
Set the examnple now. Buy your dry
goods, groceries, meats andl every
thing at home, and you will see a
wonlderful change ih a short timne in 1
the business outlook of the place;
therefore, deal with your home mer
chaunts.
8th. Spend your money at home.
What do you gain by going off?
Count the cost; see what you could
have done at home by letting your
merchant have the cash. Strike a
balance and see if you would not have
been just as well off, besides helping
your merchant.
9th. Spend your money at home. c
Your merchants are your neighbors, I
your friends; they stand y you iun I
sickness-are your associates; with I
out your trade they cannot keep your I
business. No stores, then no banks, I
no one wanting to buy property to a
settle on and build up your place. I
10th. Merchants should do their
advertising at home. They should
get their bill-heads, circulars, cards, 2
letter-heads, envelopes, and all their
printing at home, of their owu news- (
paper, who aid them in many ways, a
and advertise them hundredsof times a
without any pay whatever. Mer- I
chants should set an example to their I
customers by patronizing hlberally i
their hotr.e newspapers. Men and
women are imitative animals and are I
prone to follow examples set thnem.
How can merchants expect their ;
neighbors to trade with them if they
set thIe example of going away fromn I
home for their printing and adver
tising? Let merchants and people
all patronize home enterprise, and
home industry and home trade. So
shall they all be prosperous and
happy.

We take the following extract from
the speech of Mr. A. C. Buell, of St.
I Louis, delivered in Cincinnati on the
3d inst.;
Fellow citizens, the Democratic
patty of Ohio is so great and strong
that it cannot a~lrd to be generous,
even were not its cause so noille and
righteous that it is compelled, for the
very sake of the lituess of thin,t, to
be just. Therefore I pause in the
mnidst of this harsh and unrelenting
invective against tihe Rtepublica n mis
creanuts who have debauched the
conlitry and nade the party name
they bear hateful and despicable to
1 the world, to sayL that they are good
and honest lmen in the leadership of
the iRepublican party. But what is
thel uniformi fate of honest Repuibli
icans at the hallnds of their vile ass .
cilites s There is Willianm Walter
Phelps, of New Jersey, a gentleman
whose pulrity I can describe only li
the term "womanly" ; whose sincerity
I must call childlhke ; whose generos
ity canllot be described, and whose
honor is perfect. 3lr. Phelps signed
an honest report npon the condition
of Louisiana whenl his party associates
do nanded that he should sign a lie
for liurposes of political capital. And
lie sought to secure the repeal' of the
gag law. But to-day the forces of
Grantismn are leveled against him,
and he has been crushed by them.

It is a good time now to make the
conimellncenlenet, while the Southern
fields are lilled with corn, peas and
Ipotlatoes. Let eacllh fIarmer make ip
his mind to iprocure every hog lie can
and fatiln it up to be killed the first
cold spell.
We have had some expllerience in
hog raising in tile South, alind we can
say, witlhoult fear of contradiction,
that no country in the world can
equal Loluisiana, Mississippli, and
soalle pailrts of Texas for hog raising.
They prloduce with sulcl rapidity as
soon to overstock anIy place. We
know ofl' well authenticated instance
in Louisianai of over 300 head having
coluefrolll a single sow in one year.
The' sow, of an exceedingly prolific
breed, littered tlhirteen pigs the nlight
afteri ie was purchased and carried
homle, and eleven of theml were sow
pigs, which went to the boar at four
mouth's age.
'T'hree montlis, three weeks and
three days is said to be the period of
gestaation of a sow in Europe. Bolue
breeds, however, are more proliflo
than otheis, and we have had a breed,
nmich crossed, but largely partaking
of the qualities of the Guinea breed,
whlich brought forth younllg after 101
to 103 days' gestation, littering each
titie ten to fourteen pigs. We lived
whvere wild cats, black bears atnd Cuf
iee Ilack, Esq., were all very plenty
and very fond of pigs, so we were
compelled to take care of our hogs.
We had them watched all day by anl
old, otherwise useless, negro, and at
night put into a tight iunclosure. In
this way we lolt scarcely any, and
found that it pa;id, and paid well, to
raise hogs and take care of them.
The conlplaint now is that the "na
tion's wards" are too minnch given to
hog stealing to permnit the profitable
raising of hogs in the cottoll States.
This may be true, as hogs are now
raised, but no one should undertake
to raise hogs without having inclosed
pa:tures for them, and haviug thenm
watched, counted and attended to
daily, and brought in and inclosed at
night in a safe place. The easiest
method of securing them at night is
to build a strong stockade of lupright
stakes in the grounlld ; somnethilig like
those the whole country was dotted
with during the war. One of those
stockaldes can le made at odd times,
and if cleaned out occasionally may
be used for Iseveral years.
In thie Northwes. they fitten hogs

Stiates in Itll'n, balley and squlaslhes,
or lunilipkins. lii orthl Carolilna and
Iparts of Virgilia land SOluth Carolina,
bit little corn is ised amd peas hre re
lied on to fatten the pork hogs. lore
in the Soutllhwest we have the sweet
potato, which is more easily raised,
and is nmore prolilie, than any other
crop, and Is ftar superior to corn, Itells
or barley for fhttenimg hogs. A bush
el of sweet potattoes will go nearly as
fiar as a bulshel of corn in flattelning
hogs, aid they mlake whiter, firmer,
sweeter meat. We have raiseld and
mIeaslured up (i~l bushels of sweet po
tatoes to the aiee ; we have seen 700
raised, and last year, it is stated that
a new variety of sweet potato produ
ced in Southwest Louisiana from 800
to 1000 Ibuishels to tile acre; 200( is a
comllluont yield on poor groluindl. With
suchl a mletel'ial, sio easily raised, we
omight to stifer the exacltionsi of the
plork ring if we do not raise our own'

There is no dilncilty in euring the
meat when oilce we have it killed.
