Political quiet.
The death that awaits a Republic
is preceeded by a clamor on the part
of despots, aided by weak men, for
quiet-political ealm-a cessation of
aggitation by the people. To-day,
history is repeating itself, and this
seeming desire for the welfare of the
citizen, which is lshown by such con
sideration held out by the opposers of
a "Coustitutional Convention, will
end, as it las always ended, in disas
ter and ruin to the people of the
Common wealt Ih.
Political agitation is the life blood
of a Republic-quiet and calm, sunch
as the ninnies now ask, its winding
sheet. For a year or two after re
construction had settled upon us,
"political quiet"sneceeded, and it was
the boast of Warmoth, that the whites
of Louisiana were the "best behaved"
in the whole South. That "behavior"
was the lethargy that usually pre
ceeds death. jt was a fatal sleep,
foem ht ichg happily we were awaken
ed in time to save, at least, our de.
molished and ruined homesteads, and
a remnant of our liberties.
And" yet to.day, we find men in
sisting on "political quiet"-loudly
clamorouo for a "cessation of politi
cal strife," when the end would be
political death.
All men must understand that the
history of the world goes to prove
that one continual battle has been
waged, from theo foundation of human
government down to the present
time, between the rights of the gov.
erned and the exacting demands of
the governors. It has been a strife
in this country, conducted with va
ried success, between liberty and a
licensed centralized despotism, claim
log the power to dole out such rights
to the citizen as may suit its interest.
When newspapers presume to urge
i cessation on the part of the people
of a rigorous strife, they but invite
them to surrender their rights and
ibetttes to the few despots who cloak
their efforts to secure unlimited pow
er under all manner of subterfuges
this cry of "political quiet" being the
most plausible and the most dan.
gerous.
No. The people mast be ever on
the alert. "Eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty !" ,nd when the hour
comes in this country in which "po
litical strife" ceases and political quiet
succeeds-the nation will be wrapt
in the pall of political death; the
gloom of slavery will mantle the face
of our Republic; liberty will be en
chained, and the people be known as
a free people no more.
Our Legislature 0
Up to the nuinr of going to press-- ti
after 34 legislative working days, has o
done nothing to recommend them to
the eonfidence of our people. But a
26 days remain, during which to dis
couss those Constitutional amendments C
which are to be submitted in lieu of C
the call for a convention. Every 14
usae man kInows that during that 0
time, not half the amendments--aye
not one tenth required" can be acted
upon, simply becmse it is a physical e
impossibility,
We still cling to out opinion, that C
the session will end with a call for a
Coastitutional Convention.

The Result of Bargains.
In January 1877, the question arose
in our party--and for that matter
the same question had been broached
and its suggested policy adopted on
each such occasion, for the six years
anterior to that date-which was,
whether it was better to buy the ene
my off, or to fight him ; pnd the
buyers prevailed when the 'question
was put to a test in our counsels.
Mind you-our buyers did not pro
pose to disband their fighting men.
Oh, no! that was to be all along a
part of their stock in trade, in fact
tlhey carried more of that article of
merchandize than any other-"immn -
nity for past political offtences," ac
cepted.
Now this policy--miscalled a "peace
policy," was put in force, and all our
old clothes-dealing politicians were
called to the front. Men, whom the
weakest child in Louisiana, lisping
at its mothers breast, would not
trust out of its sight. And they have
been to the front erer since; making
that victory which was heralded forth
to the world in cane presentations
by Kidd, payment of Packard Police,
speeches by Young and yells from
the gallery generally, as the work of
sublime virtue, the laughing stock of
our sister commonwealths of the
South and a disgrace to the honor
and manhood of Southern blood.
Tile "redemption" of Louisiana
presents to the outsider; first, the
gallant, glorious battle and victory ;
second, after the defeat of the enemy
the traders and barterers come to the
front and reduce the gallant achieve
ments of the fighting men to the
victors paying tribute to the van
Squished, and third and last, the ter
B rible agony these trading fellows are
now in to explain away their action
in the redemption (!) scheme as afore
said.
Our telegrams are burdened with
ef xplanations from this one, and de
g nials from that one, and every fifty
cent note borrowed by any of these
gentlemen--oeven for cocktails in the
morning.-has to be fully explained
to a gaping crowd up North, who teel
they have an honorable set of people
on the hip, through this same bar
B tering and trading, and are indulging
in all manner of flings to torture and
wound them.
If this trade won't bear public scru
tiny-let our traders quietly shut up,
and Mr. Chandler and his crowd will
only have the echo of their own voices
tot answers to their impertinent ques
tioning. If there has been nothing
dishonorable in these tape-measuring
political blunders of Jannury
r March, 1877, out with the whole thing,
and silence Chandler's crew for ever.

New Orleans Pacuife Railway.
Representative Kelly of Winn, has
introduced a bill in the legislature of
this State granting aid to the New
Orleans Pacific Railroad. We are of
tihe opinion that no enterprise can be
of such material interest to the city of
New Orleans and the State generally
as this railroad. Representative Kel
tey's bill proposeaqto lend the States'
credit to assist in the construction and
completion of the road from New Or
leans to Shreveport, and the State line
on the route from Mansfield to Mar
shall Texas.
The State is to issue bonds not to
exceed $2,000,000, payable in forty
years, beating six per cent. interest
per annum. The bonds loaned to the
Company are to be secured by first
mortgage on all the property of the
Company and the Comlpany is prohlib
Ited from issuing more than $5,000,000
in first mortgage bonds-one-half of
which most be pledged to the State.
The bill provides amply for the pay
ment.of tile interest by the Company
and protects the State fully from, any
,f failure on the part of the Company.
d This road will be a paying one from
the start, and the action of Repreaen
tative Kelly will be cordially endor
sed by the entire people of the State,
who desire the prosperity and a de
velonpment of our material resources.
War Notes from Europe.
The following is the latest state- i
meat of the result of the armistice '
between the Russians and Turks.
The Czar's telegram to the sultan: 1
"I desire peace as much as you, but
it Is necessary for us that it should
be a4 solid and durable peace."
Thele is thaunkgiving services at
all the churches in consequence of the
armistice. Flags are floating all over
the city. Preparations are beieg
makle for a brilliant display to-night. 1
There is great satisfaction in Conu
stahtinople at the settlement of peace
preliminaries. The following are the
condition of the protocol :
First. The creation of Bulgaria
into a principality.
Second. A war indemnity or ter
ritory in compensation.
Third. The independence of Ron
I mania, Servil, and Montenegro witb
i an increase of territory for each.
Fourth. Rufoars in Bosnia and
Hersegovinia.
t. Fifth. An ulterior understanding
between the sultan and the csar re
garding the Dardanelles.

tahe New Orleans Daerent gently
S4*fai up the General Assembly of
tlhe tate on its duty-to call a Corn.
stitutional Convention and adjourn.
The loffettt Register.
We sincerely trust our legislators
will turn a deaf ear to the clamor of
the barroom keepers of New Orleans,
and adopt this much needed mode of
revenue.
The genius of taxatilo is in reliev
ing lands from all burdens possible
to make them, from light taxation, a
sought after investment for capital.
Louisiana is purely an agricultural
State; abounding in vast landed
wealth, and her riches and prosperity
must spring from their development.
It is, in our estimation, useless to
nask immigration, of tihe class and
character of inhabitants we desire,
while the present burden of 14? mills
rests upon our lands. No citizen will
come forward and invest his money
Swhere it assumes such a taxation.
SIt has been estimated that a net re
B venue of at least one million dollars
can be derived by the State from the
Moffett Register. It is reasonable tt
suppose that the present rate of taxa
tion on real estate can be reduced to 9
mills. What an impetus even this
would give to the development of our
farms, and with their increase in val.
ue, this could be ;educed to a mere
nominal rate of taxation in a few
, years.
The reduction of expenses-other
r than clerks and pages salaries-with
the adoption of the Moffett Register,
would go far to prove the sincemity of
e our pledges to the people, and we
earnestly entreat our Legislators to
adopt some relief to the already over
burdened real estate of the common
wealth.
Surrender of Wells.
NEw ORLEANS, Feb. 4.-Ex-Gov.
Wells was brought to the city by the
morning train of the New Orleans
and Mobile railroad. A carriage was
in waiting at Claiborne street inter
section to avoid the crowd which had
gathered at Canal street depot. Wells
was taken to the parish prison. He
is suffering from a slight attack of
pneumonia, Dr. Smythe, his phlsi
cian, was sent for. Wells declines to
answer any qutestions as to his reasons
for leaving the town or surrendering.
The current report is that he sur
rendered to save sureties on his
bonds, but the fact is his counsel ex
pected to get a favorable jury out of
the new panel which was drawn for
the present month.
Receiving but cold contort from his
friends in Washington, Wells returns
-and lie returns principally because
a favorable jury panel has been
drawn-for him.
We are fully preparjd to see Wells
go scott free. The people demanded
his trial and conviction-his guilt no
man questions-but a combination
has been made to secure his, and the
entire Returning Boards' acquittal,
which the Attorney General, the
Judge, nor the people can overcome.
This matter ends or will end in the
political seclusion for life-the self
hermitage as it were-of more than
one, at present howling, Democratic
Conservative retormer. When men
claim to be extra-honest and conduct
political battles on the principle of
throwing high-dice the quicker they
are sent back to the rear the better
I for the citizen of the State. Selah !

OUR WASHINGTON LET'ER.
W.ASlIsTosO. D. C., Jan. 20l, 1878.
If Senator Blaine had the same
command over his own passion that
lie has over tile average Republican
of Maine, lie would be a wonder in
deed. lie would compel respect '
where lie now receives only a ques- s
tionable sort of admiration, and his bi
opinions, now utterly disregarded on
all the questions of real interest to F
the people at large, would have V
weight. We may hunt the proceed- I
ings of Congress through from the (;.
time lie first entered the House to '
the time when the other day, he need
lessly and inopportunely attacked
the State of Massachusetts, and we
shall not find one important measure
which originated with hinm or one to
which h gave gave character. He Jias
not the confidence of those with
whom lie serves ; nine men in ten, in
Congiess, will tell you in advance m
that in anything Blaine proposes I
there ill be somethingseltish or sen- ti
sational and nothing that is broad or ti
patriotic. The attack on the past of ,
Massachusetts is an illustration of si
what I mean. There is not a mem- I
ber of Senate or House who does not u
agree with Senator Hoar that, but for *'
the fact that Massachusetts helped e
to defeat Blaine at Cincinnati, the ai
criticism on Massachusetts would not
have been uttered. The boundless
self of the Senator must make a fail
ure to support him a cause of attack
dpon the history of a State.
The debate on the subject of silver
r in the Senate on the 24th inst., was
interesting. Senator Lamar made a
lengthy speech, declaring that lie
should vote against remonetization.
f Senator Thurman took exactly the
B opposite ground. It is believed a vote k
will be reached on the Matthews re- n
solution to day, and from that vote
we may judge pretty well whether or
not any renonetization bill pass over Â°
the expected veto. Estimates of the
vote vary considerably, but the best
opinion seems to be that two-thirds
of the Senate will not vote for the
resolution. If not, of course they
e will not for the remonetization bill,
a and then, if the expected veto comes,
a the silver men have only left to them
Sthe resource advocated by Ben But
I ler, which is to attach the bill as an
a amendment to some one of the ne- f
e cessary appropriation bills.
f The cases of Gen'l. Runkle restored c
- to the Army, and Dr. Draper, to the
a navy, come lp in some form every a
s day in Congress. The Judiciary
Committee of the Senate have charge
of the investigation of both cases.
s Curiously enough the same Congress
which proposes to condemn Mr.
if Hayes for his action in these cases, is
r about to re-open the case of Dr. 1Ham
mond, formerly Surgeon General of
the army, dismissed by sentence of
Court, Martial 14 or 15 years ago. It
is to be hoped Congress will not make
e fish of one case and flesh of another.
a It seems to be the general belief
entertained here among politicians of
every school that the efforts now I
making apparently to re-organize the
i Bristow faction and to put that gen
0 tleman in training for Presidential I
n nomination by the next Republican
Convention, will prove quite as de
cided a failure as was his candidacy
, in 1876, though lie should come en
Sdorsed and urged by the present
* W~ite House incumbent. It puzzles
theose here most familiar with his
achievements as Secretary of the
Tr reasury to account for the distinc
n tion sought to be conferred by giv
. ing him a "State dinner" in any way
other than to suppose it intended to
formally endorse him as a suitable
t person to succeed Mr. Hayes. The
f careful grooming, so to speak, that Ihe
y has just received at Boston at the
hr andls of the click of hermaphodite
politicians, who dominate political
affairs in the Bay State, is pointed to
as confirming this view; but outside
of a few personal adherents, most of
them credited with nothing higher
than interested motives, Mr. Bristow
e was about the most unpopular here
d of any of the several candidates who
made tile race at Cincinnati in June
S1876; and hlie was almost forgotten
i when it was announced that Messrs.
u Schurs, Evarte and Sherman of the
a- Cabinet, Senators Edmnnds, Allison,
t Beck and Davis and Chief Justice and
Stheir wives and daughters would
unite with the President's family in
honoring Mr. Bristow at a State Din
ner given last evening at the White
SHouse.

Drowned In a Cistern.
(Colfax Chronicle.)
Last Baturday night a little negro
boy, named William Brandon, and
aged about twelve years, fell in the
cistern at the back of Mr. C. H. Mumni
ford's store, and the fact was not dis
covered until Monday morning, when t
tile body was found floating on the
water.
Saturday night Mr. Kraft asked the
little fellow if he could get a bucket
of water. As he disappeared and did "
not come back that night Mr. Kraft J
concluded lie had ggone home. Sun
day morning a trope and bucket was
discovered in the cistern, when it was
supposed the boy had dropped it .in
the night before, and,,. becoming
frightened, had run horme to his motJ
er, and still nothing wae thought of
it.
It seems the child's mother all the
while supposed hle was in town and
gave herself no uneasiness as to his
wheteabouts, and no one suspected Ã½
" the truth until Monday, when the
horrible discovery was made by a ne
gro man, who had come to catch the
bucket.

In 1872 your Vegetine was recommended to
me, and, yielding to the peisnasions of a friend,
I consented to try it. At the time I was stiffer
ing from gereral'debeility and nervous prustra.-.
tion, superinduceÂº,by overwork and irregular
habits. Its wonderful strengthening and cnr
. alive properties seemed to affect my debilitathd J
vstem froml the first dose ; andl under its per
I sistent use I rapidly lecovered. gaining more
than usual health and good feeling. Since then
I have not hesitated to give Vegetine my most
unqualified indorsement, as being a safe, sure.

restoring the wasted system to new life and

anti as long as I live I never expect to find a I
