and w e have grown now until we are above all others in the shoe

all leather, and will wear.

Our Ladies* Department.
Our $1.75, $2.00 and $2.50 shoes are simply superb.

•Senator Tillman lias called forth
•considerable comment by keeping
quiet during the first month of the
session, but no one seems tn notice
that the pile of sawdust around the
desk of Senator Spooner has also
been gettingjiretty high.
The automobiles owned in New
York are said to have cost $70,000,-
000. When we add to this the cost
of repairs and fines paid, we can see
that it is the auto that makes the
money go.
On examining the stomach of one
of his patients, immediately after ad
ministering a drink of whiskey, a
physician found it heavily charged
with electricity. Afterward the pa
tient found himself heavily charged
for the drink.
Miner Hicks is a Spanish war vet
eran, but he made the mistake of not
enlisting with the Rough Riders.
Which explains why he was buried
in a mine instead of one of the gov
ernment departments.

DR. W. M. PITTS’
ANTISEPTIC INVIGORATOR
The Greatest Family Medicine
Dr. W. M. Pitts, who, as the originator of Pitts’ Carminative, has
been a benefactor to tired mothers and suffering babes, after a suc
cessful practice of Fifty Years, now offers to the public his Greatest
Combination of Medicines in PITTS’ ANTISEPTIC INVIGORATOR. It is
a great scientific medicine. Although new to the people, it is a great com
bination of health-giving medicines, and cures when all else fails. It puri
fies the blood, stimulates the action of the liver, bowels, and kidneys, there
by removing poisonous bacteria (or germ) matter from the whole system,
to aid nature in her work of restoring perfect health. It tones up the
stomach and gives appetite. It is unfailing in the cure of all stomach,
bowel, and kidney troubles. The nervous system is restored to its normal
condition, and many of the most serious ailments —such as sleeplessness,
heart trouble and the like —yield to the healing virtues of the Invigorator.
In fact, it acts on every organ of the body, thereby curing nearly all the
different diseases of this age. Every drop of blood is affected and puri
fied by its use. The blood is the life, therefore if you get the blood pure,
all parts of the entire system will be brought under its powerful heal
ing influences. Antiseptic Invigorator is rightly named, and it is one
of the greatest germ killers and invigorating tonics now on the market.
For sale and GUARANTEED By all Druggists. Price 50c and SI.OO
per bottle. If your Druggist don’t keep it and will not get it for you we
will send it, express prepaid, on receipt of price.
