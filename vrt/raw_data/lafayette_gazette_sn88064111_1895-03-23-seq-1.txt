Oil Gus tiegeth
er before the
fo-rmer met
, with his un
timely end the literature of the world
might have been the richer by one
more story of stirring adventure and
thrilling incident upon the raging
main. In the two score years since the
Yankee sailor first saw the light of
day in the ancient port of Nantucket,
he has met with a variety of experi
ences worthy the pen. of any novelist,
and unsurpassed in interest by the
flights of the most fanciful imagina
tion in fiction.
The rare old days when the. life of
the seafaring man was one of unend
ing adventure have aboit passed away.
,g The remotest corners of every ocean
Shave long since been explored, and
i. their secrets given to the geographers;
the gentle practice of marooning has
fallen into a worthy disuse, and the
only pirates that now infest the seas
-re the skulking robbers of the Malay
peninsula. The black flag along with
tlhe'thousand other things dear to the
man with an imaginative mind has
S been relegated into the limbo of the
0 past; and no adventurous cook may
ever again hope to discover a second
a group of Hawaiian isles and be hon
ored by queen' and country for his
daring.
Of all the once numerous classes of
sea adventurers the whaling man
alone exists to-day. lie is the sole re-,
mainfig link between the glorious
past and the matera.l present, says the
5 St. Louis Republic. Sir Walter Raleigh,
stout-hearted Francis Drake, Capt.
Kidd and Lafi m the Gulf Tiger, live
only on the pi of history; but Whale
Oil Gus, the bor m sriner of Nantucket,
a now a resident of St. Louis, still re
h mains to gladden the hearts of red
a blooded folk with his tales of stirring
times upon the vasty deep. In
his life, Whale Oil Gus has crowd
ed enoug'h experience, to fill a
dozen volumes of adventure. The
press of circumstance still keeps the
s doughty whaler away from the sea he
loves so well, despite its cruel treat
ment of him, and he reluctantly con
L-sented to tell a Republic young man
the following chapter of his life:
Among a rare collection of harpoon
whale guns and other paraphernalia of
his collection Gus possesses a long
wooden handled, rusty bladed knife,
which he counts among the dearest of
his treasures.
"Do you see this ugly weapon?" he
asked, holding up the murderous look
iig blade and running h;s thumb along
C the ruty edge. "Well, he knife has a
history. It flgurel in one of the most
t t~ing episodes of tnv career.
"It was in the as.ring of '33 that -we
sailed away from New Bedfordtown on
the good ship Marie, Lound for the
whaling grounds of the southern seas.
Counting the five 'offcers, there were
thirty-two souls on board, the crew be
ing composed of :.silors of every na
tionality, -but principally of New Bed
ford men. It is an old saying among
people who follow the ocean that out
* of every complement of officers on
board a shill'one i sure to be a villain.
The truth of this saying was proved in
,the case of the Marie before we had
been two days out of port. When a lot
of -men are huddled- together in the
narrow compass of a whaling vessel it
doesn't take themh long to find out one
another's characteristics, and before
the second day's sun had sunk into the
sea we men in the forecastle had de
cided that Tom Johnson, the second
I mate, was the one to be feared. Capt.
P- Edwards, although a mighty fine sailor
s and a good whaleman. -vas a ltle bit
weak in matters of disci.line,;~nd the
Ssecond mate seemed to take it upon
himself to run the whore ship.
S "'By the time we had got off thecoast
of Brazil the men found his conduct so
unbearable that they went in a lody
to ,the shipper and made complaint.
The captain said he'd look into the
mattAr,- aia advised the men to go on
abouit t - business, and try to put
up witl ~ n asi long as possible.
This didn't satisfy us, of course, but
there wasnothing to be -done except
Skbac-to work, which we did at once.

castle.
"When the men came down from
among the shrouds they helped their
wounded shipmate to his hammock,
and then held a council of war. They
decided to again go to the captain and
lay before him an ultimatum. This was
done, the men declaring that they
would quit the shipat the first port un
less the mate was turned down. The
captain explained that Johnson had
shipped under a contract, and all that,
but that he would try to get rid of him
as soon as possible. This answer had
to satisfy us, though every one of us
vowed vengeance on that mate, and
we again want back to work.
"Things went on this miserable way
until we rounded the Horn and started
up the Chilian coast. Then one of the
men, named Randall--George Randall
--fell sick. He was a delicate sort of a
chap, anyhow, and everybody predicted
he wouldn't come back to New Bedford
when he shipped with tl. Well, as I
said, he fell hick, and was so feeble oneo
morning that he couldn't show on deck.
When the rest of us had lined- up the
second mate noticed Randall's absence
and asked with an oath where he was.
Some one replied that he was sick.
Randall had been one of the leaders in
the protest- which had been made to
the captain about the mate, and John
son knew it, and recognized his chance
to get even. Going into the forecastle
he began abusing poor Randall, and
ordered him to get up and go to-worlk.
The-sick man replied that he couldn't do
it, and with that the mate grabbed him
by the throat and literally dragging
him out on the deck and over to a pile
of rope yarns, ordered him to make a
ball of sennit. Poor Randall, pale as a
ghost, and that feeble that he could
hardly raise his hand, was too weak and
afraid to make any resistance, and be
gan twisting the yarn as best he could.
All of a sudden the slow motion-f his
hands ceased, his body swayed once or
twice, and then fell over, face for
ward. Alexander, a Norwegian sailor
who was one of the sick man's chums,
and myself rushed over to help the
poor fellow, but when we raised him
up and looked into his face we saw at a
glance that he was dead. He had been
killed by cruelty.
"Seeing us bending over Randall's
body the second mate came forward
and demanded to know what was the
matter. He might have seen for him
self if he hadn't been a demon, but we
told him-and then happened the most
horrible thing it has ever been my mis
fortune to see. With the laugh of a
fiend Johnson cried:
" 'He's dead, is he? Well, just watch
me bring the cur to..lifel' And with
that he raised his foot and gave the
poor corpse a kick full in- the face.
" 'I'll teach him how to shirk his
world' cried the monster, as he again
kicked poor George's body. 'I'll show
him what it is to pretend to be dead'
"YOU LI*"
and he jerked the corpse up and shook
it, and throw it down again, and kicked
it around and around the deck, cursing
all the while like a maniac.
"By this time the captain had been
attracted by the noise and carae out to
see what was up. He was horrified and
ordered the inhuman creature to stop
his ghastly work and go aft.
"That settled it. We determined to
take the case of the second mate in our
own hands that very night and avenge
our wrongs and the indignities heaped
upon our dead comrade as swiftly as
possible. That evening the wind low
ered and we were becalmed. Before
eight o'clock our plans had been laid.
We were to break out in open mutiny
and demand the mate's life from the
captain, in whose cabin, with prob
.ably some premonition of the doom in
store, for him, the villain had taken
refuge. If the captain proved unwill
iin we were to go into the cabin and
get him, anyhow. As we snupected, the
captain would not listen ti . There
upon two men seised'him hd.held him
fast, while we wvnt after the 'monster
who had been making our lives a hell.
"Each man of us had a knife, and
when we appeared at the dcor of the
cabin the mate read in our faces what
'wve intended to do. Alexander, the
Norwegian, was in advance, and to him
tge cowardlycur fell.on his knees and
began begging for his life. There was
no delay, 'and not a word'was spoken.
With one swift, sure blow with this
knife I hold in my hand, Alexander
leaned forward andal struck the cower
ing mate full in the heart. As silently
Sas the deed had been done, we picked
.up the hated body and, carrying it to
the I-ailing, flung it into the sea.
"The next morning poor Randall's
body was shrouded and sunk with due
solemnity, and then. each one of us
went to Capt. Edwards and placed our
selves under his commands again.
"When we reached Valparaiso we
-ewertried -before the Amerl-an.consul
on the charge of mi~dder and mutiny
on thie high seak. But the captain did
not press the cases, and whea e told
the consul our story we wer Al dis
charged.
S"That is the history behind this rusty
old knife you see here. May the good
Lord deliverme from such Bnother ex

TO oLEAN- OARPETS.
Care and Strength awe Needed. But IS t
Can Be DOms at aome. . .
It is often the eaise that accidents n
happen when one is far away from a u
cleaner's or wben,, perchance, the '
carpet may lno# "worth the expense 1
of the professional's services, but. y
would be extremely useful if put in t
good order.
A simple and' efectual means of a
gdeaning it is to'rip the breadths apart, c
if the carpet is large; take one breadth
at a time dvr-a. common kitchen table r
Cr wide board and scour with prepared o
soapsuds, if necempary, or naphtha. If t
that substance is to be used, scrub a
the carpet tLorou gjly with an ordinary -i
scrub brush. If-thee washing is done 1
with soapsuds, it is well to rinse the c
carpet thoroughly, which may be done I
by throwing on- pailfuls of water i
and scrubbing it out with the brush to t
rid the fabric of the suds as nearly as
may be. If the carpet shows =
symptoms of fading, or if the colors
threaten to run, it is quite worth while f
to go over it again and again with the i
brush and with soft cloths and re
move the water as rapidly as possibl~ ,
meanwhile having the board or table
tipped at an angle so as to allow all I
surplus water to drain away as quickly i
as it can. This is rather slow work
and hard work; but if well done, the
result will be a carpet entirely cleaned,
perfectly wholesome and quite good t
enough for an upper room or for the
rags and pieces that are required in c
every house.
RELIEF FOR TAILORS.
Sow to Measure Falr Clients for Blfar
eated Garments.
A correspondent writes the following
letter to Haberdasher on the absorbing
and delicate topic of bloomers:
"I noticed in a late edition of a New
York paper sn editorial referring to a
lawsuit in which a lady refused to take
a pair of bicycle pants because they did
not fit. The tailor declared they were
according to the measures given him,
and he did not take the measures. The
article wound up by prophesying a for
tune in store for the tailor who could
take a lady's measure correctly and not
infringe the laws of modesty, or words
to that effect. I was surprised, for I
know that many old lirds in our pro
fession can do that. For the benefit of
the rising generation' I submit the ad
joining formula:
"The acknowledged difficulty in tak
ing the measures-for ladies' bifurcated
nether garments is how to get the leg
seam. By using this method there is,
as Mr. Podsnap would remark, 'no oc
casion to bring a blush on the cheek of
a young person.'
"First take the length fromn- point A
to the ground, then ask the lady to take
a seat on a flat-bottomed chair, and
take the measure from C to D; deduct
this from the first measure and you
have the leg seam, Q E D.".
Jost Before the Reception.
Here is the course of preparation used,
by a prudent beauty before' baring her
neck and anms in evening dress: To be
gin with she takes a cold plunge all
over; it is merely a pldnge,- and then
she rubs herself vigorqusly with rough
towels; then ie neck, arms and breast
are bathed -hi aledhol which is allowed
to dry upb them; next comes the cocoa
oil that dnow plays auch a part. in fash
ionable dressing - rooms; the neck,
breast'and armskre -bathed if it, rub'
bing it in roughly. When the flesh
is afterwteds. wiped with a soft. cloth,
no sign ci grease is visible on:the skin,
but an imperceptible amount does re
main,ahi&inkTes a perfect condition
for the applicatidn, of powder; the pow
der is part of the scheme of protection,
as well aa beautifying measure. After
this programme is completed the lady
declares she issafe against any exposure
encountered in pursuit of social duty.
Really Rematiable Family.
On a pretty little farm high up
among the hills of Calhoun county,
Ala., 1,000 feet above the sea, lives' a
most remarkable family. Their name
is Sadler. The family consiste of a
brother and four sisters, and the
youngest has already tiurnedl his
ninety-frst year. The qldest is several
.years more than- a dentury old. None
of them has ever mavrriMa. Th"e Sadlers
were born in the Old Dominion state.'
In 1881 the family moved to An~lahtte
and CalhouM countyr,, about - Hif-tenn
miles east - of.. Anniston.. Two yersa
later they 'became possessed of the
pronerty on which they now live,:and
there erected a log h6use, which d oni

A WELL-KEPT HAND.
S ay -r 'Be eg '-A,'ir by ay.. wuetwia
These Daeentima.
A beautiful handis not always possi
ble to acquire, but.a thoroughly well
kept one may beh lad without the art of
manicure, and by -even simpler meas
ures than these recommendein Vogue:
To begin with, the hands should always
be washed in very hot water, or, better
yet, in warm oatmeal. water. Failing
this, a few drops of tincture of 11noin
in the water add gre;tlky to th t-* ite
ness and softness of the skin, ldasaLo
conduce to the l)eutifying of thenails.
When the ha4eire ;thoroughly clean,
rinse them in eas, a5rm water, into
which a -oteab a 4: almond meal
has been thrown. Dry the hands op a
soft towel and immediately rub them
with the followingmixture: One part
pure glycerine, one part lemon juice,
one part rosewater.. This can be pre
pared either for immediate use on kept
in a bottle for three or foir days at a
time.
Twice a week the nails may be
rubbed with this varnish: Half an
ounce pistachio oil, 82 grains table salt,
83 grains powdered rosin, 88. grains
ground alum, 80, grains melted white
wax, 9 grains fine carmine. These -in.
gredients should be thoroughlymifed
over a spirit lamp, made into a ;kind of
pomatum and preserved in a. asamll
glass or porcelain jar. It should be ap.
plied to the nail by a tiny wad of medi
cated cotton and allowed to remain for
half an hour. The thin membrane at
the root of the nail should then be
carefully pushed back iMth the rounded
end of an ivory nail file, and the little
"idle skins" that often grow at the
root of the nail cut away with a'pair of
very sharp scissors. When this is don
the nail should be polished with the soe
called "diamond powder," a small
quantity of which is put on a chamois
skin nail polisher. The hands are then
washed in hot oatmeal water, well
dried on a very fine towel, and finally
the nails are polished once more with
a soft chamois.

Where a person must depend upon a
milkman for his milk, the outside closet
that is represented in the sketch may
be taken advantage of, particularly if
one is building a new house or remod
eling an old one. Where .the milk is
left early in the morning upon the
doorstep or piazza, it is at the mercy of
wind and weather, and of: prowling
cats and dogs, even when a cloned ves

milk closet cannot be made, it might be
found of advantage to make use of a

How to Keep .ats Away.
In a recent issuie of the Old Iome
stead, we read this-about keeping ants
away, and as it may help some bee
keeper who is troubled by ants,; we
give it.a place here: Rub a light film
coat of balsam Peru around near the
botton-of'table or kitchen safe legs
just a narrow band will do-and renew
the balsam every .twg or ti~ree weeks.
This will keep anta saway from tables,
kitchen safes, etc., and what taey'hold
or contain, provided there is no other
ant-way than up the legs. One drop of
balsam Peru spread around the upper
part of a sirup bottle will keep the
ants away for mnnths. Boil one ounce
of balsam Peru 3n one gallon of rain
water for halfuan hour, and sponge this
" water, while hot, over wooden floors
and walls, and it will keep ants .away
for a long time.

AGRICULTURAL HIINITS.
CONVICTS IOR ROAD WORK.
Mr. Roblason., carsa Csmmtr (N. 4r.)
suapervlser, Tell.. H npeissese. -
If there were a probability tfat "the
state or county authorities would ap
propriatefunds -sufficient to employ r
free labor in the construction of our
common roads, I would #treztuously op
pose the employment of prison .con
victs on the work. I believe that true
economy would be .found in building °
up our highways through the--intel- t
ligence and skill of honest industry. ,
More work and better work would be
seeured and the expenditures would n
meet with a wider circulation in the
community and would subserve more
diversified nterests. But it is con
ceded that neither state nor county i
authority has reachedor islikely to
reach, the advanced position where ap
propriations will be made adequate to
the construction of roads by the hand
of the free and honest citizen. If this'
be true, then it is equally obvious that
the friends of "good. roads" must de
pend on the use of such .means in the
furtherance "of their projects as may
be offered.
Last year the employment of con
viets on the common roads was entered
upon: in this county. So far as this see
tion of the state is concerned the work
was experimental. The legislature.ap
proprlated 165,000 to be spent in build
ing roads within thirty miles of. the
thwee prisonsof the state and the money
as divided, each prison receivingl
65,000; to this sum, by. .subsequent act
of the legislature, the agent and warden
were authorized to draw $1,666.66 for
guarding, sheltering and the care of
the con tets. Oht of that sum was paid
the civil eigineer and surveyor from
the state engineer's office at Albany.
The agent and warden;, a friend of
"good roads," pushed the work vigor
ousJy and faithfully. During the few
months left to him, he built and com
pleted three miles of macadumiied
road, using broken stone and gravel
for top dressing, which were thorough
ly rolled by steam roller. He also pre
pared many miles of road under the
direction of road commissioners and
has opened ditches and turnpiked three
miles of road on the west side of Owaseo
lake, and has constructed many sluice
ways for the carrying' off of surface
water-one of the maost essential things
in the proper construction of roads. -
1 am informed by Mr. Stout that not
an attempt was made by a convict to
escape and that he found it necessary
to employ but one guard for ten con
victs. The threat to lock a man for the
day in his cell and to keep himn from
his outdoor work was sufficient to se
cure discipline.
This evidence of Mr. Stout's would
seem to negative the statement recent
ly made by Superintendent Lathrop in
an interview published in the New
York papers, wherein he is reported as
saving that it required atthe Danue
mora prison two guards for each con
vict, and thatt3,000 was expended from
the road fund in securing two escaped
convicts.
The superintendent of state prisons
does not agree with the legislature, nor
does he agree with himself. Two years
-ago the legislature provided for the
work of 200 convicts on the roaa4; last
year it extended the number to 600
convicts-and the superintendent made
no official protest. In his report of
1894, through one of his agents and
wardens, he says:
"Taking into consideration that the
convicts worked only eight hours per
day and that they, -as well as their
keepers, *ere inexperienced in road
making, the above showing (of the
roads ma4e) is one that is entirely sat
isfactoy. "That a limited number of
convicts can be worked successfully at
road building is now an established
fact and that the road constructed is a
first-class one is conceded by every one
i who has seen it."
The road here referred to is the road
constructed at Dannemora prison in
Clinton county, which he denounces in
his newspaper interview.
Agent and Warden Stout could not
have "been advised of this change of
front on the part of his superior, for,
in a carefully considered letter, ad
dressed to one of our citizens and writ
s ten within the laSt month, the agent
and warden thus expresses himself:
r "I am thoroughly convinced that the
scheme of building roads by convicts
Is a step in the right direction. I think
we can build macadamized roads
throughout the country for from $800
to $1,000 a mile, and in my annual re
port to the sunerintendent of prisons
this year, I shall recommend a lyger
appropriation for building and re ir
f in reds. I find where I have worked
Sthati the farmers are becoming greatly
. interested and have rendered apistanee
r in the way of donating stone and team
Swork: I also believe that in thetfuture
appropriations should be made and
- that it would be advisable for the dis
& tricts Ii'which the work is done to join
r the. state Yorces a'nd work theifr oad
- tax in connection with work done
by the state aut~horities-"
S I assame that the statement madc'by
t Agent and Warden Stout, that- the
,macadamizer '-"d could be contruct
i ed for 800 per mOile by convict labor,
- intends to include only the cost of ma
b terial, of teams, machinery and hards,
-.and assumes that the labor of the con
5 viects canaot be charked to the expense
*, count: nat.-wise it seems hardly
pssible that his estimate would be
.s-~:ient. It he is correct, then we
I would be compelled to admit that con
viet road building is the cheapest at
tainable means for the making of good
