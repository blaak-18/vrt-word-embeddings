CELEBRATED
LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OF
Ispatitis, or Liver Complalat
DYSPISIA AND SICK uHsDACHs.
id
Symptoms of a Diseasl Liver.
IJAIN in the right side, under the
I edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure ; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
h accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done., A slight,
. dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
f In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has I
shown the LIVER to have been exten-.
sively deranged.

DR. C. MCLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN

taken with Quinine, are productive of

Gov. Sprague Accusing Senator' Ceok.
Hlg with Having Broken Up ite

Not Concerned in the
Drama-Sprague
Very Reticent,
but Firm.
The following Is an intelligent
statement from the Narranett Pier
correspondent of the ew York
Times:
From a number of sources the fol
lowing story has been obtained: Mrs.
Sprague was. on Monday last, at
Canonchet, with her three children
and four visitors, namely, Mr. and
Mrs. Martin, Miss Martin and Miss
Alexander. Toe house was not open
for summer visitors, but these friends
were there, and it is said they were I
to remain for a few days. According
to the statement made by Morris,
overseer of the piace, Senator Conk
ling arrived at the house on Tuesday
eveniog last, were he was welcomed
as he drove up under theporte coehere j
Mr. 8prague was in Portland, wither a
he had gone the first part of the ,
week, and the servants did not ex- t
peat him toreturn until Saturday. c
esnator Conkling, t Is said, remain- a
edat the house on Wednesday and
Thursday. Late on Thursday night
Mr. Sprague returned. He did not
bear of the arrival of Senator Conk- s
ing, It is said, until he had visited t
the Pier on Friday morning, for he I
expressed much astonishment when e
he was told the fact by. a tradeeman t
with whom he conversed. He was t
seen returning to Canonchet. and n
when next observed he was riding I
into the place in pursuit of Prof. c
George Linck, a German tutor, who g
had been engaged by Mrs Sprague n
to lostruct her son Willie. Having t
driven in a very excited manner In k
search of the man, he went back to p
COonochet, What followed is gath. t
saed only gro the statements of 8l
persons about the house, made with
Inettol0 as to secrecy.
On his arrival at the house Mr. *.
Spragsue it is aid, immediately
isougr eastor Coonkliang, and a coan- t
verestion with him followed, parts aI
of which were overheard by people tI
in the house. One of the servants h
declares that in the ball Mr. Sprague a
loudly ordered Beastor (onkliog to ai
leave the house, sayinog he woul I
gire bm twenty malnutes to sret out h
of slght, and that l he did not go he *
would shoot hi-l. There were other
loud remsark, but the sevants e*th

Indistinctly by several persons, ano
each of the relators givei a slightly

who waits upon the guest of the cafe
says that Mr. Conkliog was not ex- I

a lunch of milk and crakers. After I
awhile a team, that was said to have I

and a lady of medium height, rather
stout and very well dressed, con

stood on the porch. This carriage
came baok a second time to give the
occuprit an opportunity to talk I
with Mr. Curkling.

[From the Nashville Banner.]
F. Several years ago General Forrest
visited the city and stopped at the c
old City Hotel. That night several t
gentlemen called to see him, among e
them a gentleman now connected '
ik* with the BANNER. The room had b
been crowded during the early part ,
of the night and Forrest had receiv c
ed the usual attention bestowed on d
him. Now, however, he was sitting a
off by himself, and appeared worn c
and tired out. Our Informant wish.

conversation with him. I
"General," says he "I've heard
at you were a great poker player in d

played some," and his eyes began to

re. times, and he at once seemed inter. q
at ested in the subject, for be it known ts
so that no one was fonder than he in s1

I Election Marshals.
Mis [New York Herald,.
Od The Congressional investigation in
ns- to the election In one of the Cinein
Ds. nati distrioct has brought out very
is ,dearly the partlsan use whlih Lt
80 made of the "deputy marshals for
ho elections purposes;" and will In
ad crease the regret of wise men of both
ad parties that the Elections Marshals
he law was not repealed. It Is a law
rd 'logularly liable to abuse, and the
o,1 testimony taken in Cincinnati shows
ly that it was shamelessly bused b)
r, the republicans there. The Elections
ue Marshals were used not to keep the
rY peace at the polls, but to electioneer
e for the republican candidates, and
x- by various and devious means in
toe crease their vote. It was shown,
er moreover, that the provision that
V |these political marshals shall be ap.
P. pointed in every ease from the vo
er ters of the precinct where they are
n- to serve was violated, and the par
he tlnso electioneeringagents with mar
re shal's badges, paid by the public
le treasury to pertfrm a public service,
lk but In fact working for their own
side, were chosen in republican
wards and sent to electioneer at
., democratic polls.
What sort of men are selected by a
partisan marshal for such election
Seering work at the public expense
was show in the Philadelphia invese
tigation. It was proved there that
the republican marshal not only se
lected unscrupulous and notorious
st partisans, who spent their time as
he deputy marshals in electioneering,
al but severalof them were drunk on
19 election day; one was detected in
d voting twice; one was a jail bird who
id had served two terms, once for high.
i way robbery and once for shooting a
V colored boy; another had been un
in der arrest for five different robberies;
i1 another, a notoriously dangerous
U character, had been tried for murder;
' another, a colored man, was the
It keeper of a gambling house; yet an
0 other was the keeper of a low drink
ing house; another had been repeat.
d easy nla the House of Correction for
n drunkenness; another, again a col
red man, was the keeper of a house
e of ill fame, and so the list goes on.
0 All were republican politiciaus.
Senator B yard was undoubtedly
wise when he urged the republic-ns
0 to help to repeal the Election Mar
shals law, and held that no party
ougpt to be trusted with such power
when in possession of the govern.
ment, and that the republicans would
some day keenly regret their oppo
sition to the repeal, because the law
was necessarily earrupting to them
and would be to the democrats it
they should ever get power. In re.
slating the repeal at the extra ses
sion the republicans put themselves 4
in the wrong before the country, for
they cannot defend such scandals as I
the investigations are uncoverino. 4
The country may congratulate itel f I
that tbe demoorats have so absolute.- 1

they may have to be held to their

dieoult debt to collect is one owingl f
by a State. It oanoot be sued, nor
can It be paid by any pf the State's
omccals without speemfe appropria- ,
tion by the legislature, and there the E
most righteous 1him that ever was ,
presented labors under suspicion, G
and in nine eases out of ten ls either B
neglected or defeated. The remedy at
attempted by the legislature of New
ampsblre, however, is of doubtful
egality ano propriety. The acquire
meet of citizenuship for the purpose
of obtaining a legal status for the d(
maintenance of suits would become
wan avocatIon. It would be doing nl.
directly that which most of the State '
constituations provide shall not be
done directly, and would not proba.
bly be sustained by the court of last
resort before whbloh It would surely
be brought. There ought certalnly
to be some means dervled by whnlh e
a State could be compelled to adju4- ri
sate its debts and settle them. Whble i
it cannot he doubted that some of '
the 8outhern States, like Louisna,
