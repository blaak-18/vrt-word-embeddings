The suffrage amendment is as
dead in this parish as the People's
ticket.
There was a Democratic meeting
at the Simoneaux hall, near Caren
cto, last Sunday.
Ex-Sheriff Duson of Acadia has
at last come out for Pharr. Du
son's flop will cause little surprise
and no regret.
Captain Pharr's speeches are said
to be very short. The old man is a
Christian and he believes in treating
others as he would like to be treated
himself.
Albert Delhomme, from Scott,
was in town Wednesday. He re
ports that the first ward is still in
line for the Democracy and white
supremacy. Pharr and the People's
ticket are at a discount in that old
Democratic stronghold.
Easton Duval, of the Houma
Courier, has issued a trade edition
of which he may be justly troud.
It contains a whole fund of valuable
information presented in a clear
anrd interesting style. We congrat
ulate our friend upon his success.
The Republican campaign was
opened at Lake Charles on the 25th
instant. An exchange says Candi
date Pharr's speech was rather brief.
If the captain has not improved
as a speaker since he preached pro
hibition in Lafayette, brevity Is
about the only thing which may be
said in favor of his oratory.
Governor Foster said to a Judge
reporter at Shreveport the other day
ehtt "the most prominent issue in
this campaign will be the mainten
ance of good government through
the success of the Democratic party
and the perpetuation of white su
premacy." The governor is right.
As long as the negro is a political
fqactor white supremacy will be the
mtost vital issue in every campaign.
TIE SENA T'ORJAL CONVEN
TION.
' Judge Fred L. Gates, of Iberia
parish, was nominated for senator
by the Democratic nominating con
vention held at New Iberia last Sat
urday. The delegates from this
parish carried out the instructions
of their constituents and withdrew
from the convention rather than
vote or help nominate a candidate
`t who is in favor of the adoption of
the suffrage amendment. In with
- drawing from the convention the
Lafayette delegation did just what
they were told to do by the Demo
crats of this parish who are almost
unanimously opposed to the amend
y ment. However, Judge Gates was
nominated without the eight votes
from this parish. It must be dis
tinctly understood that our dele
gaies were representing the Democ
racy of this parish and could pur
sue no other course. They went to
the convention with positive in
structions not to vote for an amend
ment man and it was their bounden
duty to do just what they did. Now,
of course, the supporters of Pharr
in this parish will have a greatleal
to say about the action of the La
fayette Democracy, in order to
create confusion in the ranks of the
party, but those discordant wind
jammers and pronounced enemies
of Democracy and white supremacy
have no business to meddle in Demo
cratic affairs. They have long since
ceased to be Democrats and they
should attend to their combines
with the Populists and Republicans.
AGAINST TIlE AMEND
ME T.
The Democrats of St. Mary par
ish held a nominating convention at
Franklin last Saturday. Hon. A.
C. Allen was nominated for judge
br acclamation. Gov. Foster's .ila
ministration and the State ticket
were enthusiastically endorsed.
The suffrage amendment was con
demned in most positive terms.
Like their brothers of Lafayette the
Democrats of St. Mary are opposed
to the amendment and are not
afraid to say so. We have yet to
see the Democratic party of a south
western parish declare in favor of
the amendment. Men who have al
ways been Democrats and whose
Democracy can not be questioned
refuse to support it. In his speech
at Shreveport the other day the
governor stated that he recognized
the fact that many good Democrats
throughout the State were con
scientiously opposed to it.
In his speech delived at Shreve
port Gov. Foster said:
Finding a surplus in the treasury
which had been accumulated
through an honest and economical
administration of my Democratic
predecessor, which surplus has
steadily increased under this ad- I
ministration, through the Board of
Liquidation a portion of this surplus
was devoted to the purchase and re
tirement of interest bearing State
bonds and the purchase and retire
ment of outstanding warrants of the I
State for the years 1885 and 1886
and past due coupons and baby
bonds. All these obligations were j
issued by the authority of the State,
and many of them were in the hands
of innocent third parties. The fol
lowing figures will show the details I
of these various transactions. Four
per cent bearing bonds retired $712,
ooo, at a cost of $690,731.57, saving
thereby in the purchase $21,268.43 i
and an annual interest of $28,480.
By a compromise with the creditors
the floating debt of the State, com
prising auditor's warrants and cou
pons, were settled and retired at the e
rate of sixty cents on the dollar for
warrants and 46.15 cents for cou
pons. ,
Under this agreement warrants of
1885 and x886 were retired to the P
amount of $315,555.=5, at a cost of
$189,333. 13; past due coupons to the d
amoutit of $346,900oo.28, at a cost of
$160,094.44. This comprises all of
the outstanding warrants and cou
pons presented. There are yet out
standing coupons amounting to
$138,898.52, which are provided for a
by setting aside $63,829.38 to meet
them, under act No. 150 of I894
authorizing the Board of Liquida
tion to lpurchase baby bonds exclu
sive of ,nterest. There have been t
retired of these bonds $265,i35.770,,
at a cost of $z50,589.99, saving by s
this transaction $214.545-71. Itn
will, therefore, be seen that the a
total indebtedness of the State has!(
been reduced $1,877,899.76 at a
cost of $Sr,254,578.55, saving to ti
the State the sum of $623,321.21 IS
and annual Interest of z582,48. 2
After the current demnands for the s,
year 1895 have been met, it can be Ii
safely stated that there will still re- a
main in the treasury of the State a
surplus of $3oo,ooo.
Electric Bitters.
Electric Bitters is a medicine suited for tl
any season, but perhaps more generallylsi
needed in the Spring, when the languid ex- L
hausted feeling prevails, when the liver is Itl
torpid and sluggish and the need of a tonic p
and alterative is felt. A prompt use of this sl
m.:dicine has often averted long and perhaps tl
fatal billious fevers. No medicine will ac p
more surely in counteracting and freeing the rt
syst.m from the malarial poison. iHeadache, a
Indigestion, Constipation. Dizziness, yield t)
to Electric Bitters. Only fifty cents at sI
W'rfl. Clegg's drug store. I

Comme nous I'avions apprehends
nous avons appris que ceux qui res
thrent a la convention, ont nommb
le juge Gates comme senateur apr.s
que nous nous etions retires.
C'est ainsi que nous avons agi et
nous vous soumettons ce rapport afin
que vous puissiez juger de quelle
maniere nous avons execute vos
instructions. Respectueusement,

Si non, permettez-moi de racon
ter quelques details.
On rapporte que quelquecs "Kro

ville ce jour-lit et se trouvant parmi
une foule assez nombreusa l'idee
vint a quelqu'un d'entre-eux de
faire de la politique, des discours.
L'on pouvait remarquer parmi l'as
semblee, le docteur Scranton, candi
dat pour representant de la paroisse
Lafayette et bicn connu dans le
Vermillion (tout de fois je ne crois
pas qu'il en soit de meme ici) Le
docteur Guidry et I'honorable Al
bert Chargois, candidat pour avo
cat de district (celui-ci bien connu
de nous tous).
Mais, pour en revenir i nos mou
tons, l'on raconte que le docteur
Scranton d6sirant faire impression
sur les constituents d'une paroisse
voisine, declama une diatribe achar
nue contre le gouverneur Foster,
I'honorable Julien Mouton et autres.
II est vraiment regrettable que M.
Scranton, etant candidat democrate,
attaque son propre parti dans les
personnes ou candidats choisis - la
convention de Shreveport et aux
primaires du 54 decembre. Je ne
puis comprendre comment M. Scran
ton peut esp6rer d'avoir la ma
jorit6 des voix d6mocratiques
aux elections d'avril considerant
qu'il se montre des plus oppos6s au
choix de notre bon vieux parti.

Marvelous Results.
From a letter written by Rev. J. Gunder
man, of Dimondale, Mich., we are permitted
to make this extract: "*I have no hesitation
in recommending Dr. King's New l)iscov
cry, as the results were almost marvelous in
the case of my wife. While I was pastor of
the Baptist Church at Rivers Junction she
was brought down with Pneumonia succeed
ing La Grippe. Terrible paroxysms of
coughing would last hours with little inter
ruption and it seemed as if she could not
survive them. A friend recommended Dr.
King's New Discovery; it was quick in its
work and highly satisfactorily in results.
