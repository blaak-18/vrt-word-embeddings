ummary of Tdrents as They Happen
By Tom Dolan
iSenator La Follette, the radical
Republican, and his wife are about- to
begin the publication of a weekly pa
per -advocating a government by the
people.
In the labor injunction case rela
tive to the Allis-Chalmers company,
of Milwaukee, “peaceful picketing”
has been held lawful, but the injunc
tion was sustained as to “threats, in
timidation, force, or violence” on the
part of the picketers, or as to their
in anywise, directly or indirectly, in
terfering with an employer’s busi
ness. Pickets will kindly note that,
under these terms, they may engage
in silent prayer, with the full approv
al and sanction of the courts.
The drinking fount in Atlanta, -at
the intersection of the Peachtrees,
bids fair to become as famous as was
the “gal” at the Piedmont bar.
Kindly people rejoiced when this con
venient spot was chosen for giving
drink to thirsty horses and the order
from the Park Board for its removal,
for no good reason, has not struck
a popular chord. The agitation will
produce some good results, however,
as the incident will not be purely lo
cal in its effect. Far too little is said
and done toward making existence
bearable for the patient beasts of
burden. They suffer, not because of
the positive cruelty of the public, but
because of mere apathy on such sub
jects.
After some eleven years at the helm,
Roosevelt is worried over a daily
deficit in the treasury of $3,000,000.
Singular that with all his “corking’
time” he could not have stopped up
some of the leaks. A large part of
this enormous government expendi
ture is raked in by the railroads for
carrying mail. How can he expect
his, or any other, administration that
is standing pat against the govern
ment ownership of railroads; against
an inheritance or an income tax —
against any and every provision for
economical and equitable expendi
tures and receipts to do anything but
pile up a mountain of woeful extrav
agance that will result in a landslide
of revolution?
The Pullman Company has volun
tarily reduced its seat rates a frac
tion —and yet they say the age of
miracles is not past!
Under the bank guarantee provis
ions of the State of Oklahoma,'Sf a
bank failed, it is stated that deposi
tors would have to accept whiskey
warrants. In buying the last car
load of whiskey for the State dispen
sary system, the bank guaranty fund
was checked on to pay for it. This
opens up a new line of speculation
calculated to bring the bank guaran
ty into even more doubtful status
than before. It having been held, in
the South Carolina dispensary case,
that a sovereign state has no right
to traffic in a commodity in compete
tion with the citizens thereof, the dis
pensary system itself offers a poor
guarantee to its own creditors and in
consequence the whole question ap
pears to be a jumble of many errors.
Three or four important witnesses
in the Hains murder case have been
transferred to points outside the ju
risdiction of the New York, where
the trial is to be had, which looks
very peculiar to District Attorney
Darrin, who claims that they are es
sential in proving the State’s conten
tion that the murder of Annis was
the deliberate work of sane men. Lieu
tenant Colonel Ludlow claims that
the Department’s action has any con
nection whatever with the case.
In the monthly report of the re
ceipts and disbursements of the Unit
ed States Treasury Department for
the first year ending June 30, 1908,
appears the item of over three and a
half million dollars for the Indians.
It is about time to call a halt. The
red man has been and is basely used,
in a multitude of instances, but where
the justice lies in a government grant
for every pappoose that chances to be
added to the swarm of some -anti
race suicide Creek, Cherokee or other
copper-skinned family, while thous
ands of our own children are starv
ing in the cities, going hungry to
school, slaving their tiny lives away
in mills and mines, familiar to the
coarsest uses of the slums, is beyond
comprehension. The lineal descend
ants of Great-Pie-Face might, but for
the intervention of a contrite govern
ment, be in the sorry case of having
to grow up to make his own living;
which would be terrible. But the
small Caucasian, who is the victim of
every sort of ancestral injustice, is
left to fight his battles as best he
can —which means that Infant Mor
tality scoops him in early, or he sur
vives to be buffeted by every adverse
fate. There is always Northern phil
anthropy for the pickaninnies and
grants for the Indian child and there
is provision for the old soldier, hos
pitals for the sick —but God help the
orphaned babe or the unfortunate
child of the submerged tenth.
A beautiful little four-year-old,
crippled by tuberculous bones, was
strapped all day long to a board. He
had been cared for awhile by a pri
vate charity that found him, too late.
So they talked to the dying baby of
Heaven and asked him if he were
not glad to be going there? Turning
his eyes wistfully to the other child
ren, he replied: “Yes —but I wish —
I wish —I could play a little, first!”
Thousands of creatures like him
are perishing every year for lack of
nourishment, which costs so little and
for the air and sunshine, which are so
free —to all but the children of the
poor.

A delightful plan conceived in Aus
tralia, is to have every school boy
there attempt to find -a correspondent
in some boy of England and America,
731) e Jeffersonian
that they may write to each other in
the spirit of friendliness about their
respective countries and their inter
esting selves. Why not get the girls
interested? Then there would be
something doing that would tax the
postal facilities of all three nations
to the utmost.
Great Britain, Russia and France
have already agreed upon a program
to be presented at the conference of
the European powers to settle the
Balkan situation. Which is very
nice, though the parties most con
cerned therein haven’t made plain
their intentions. And what Turkey
is to get out of it does not appear
to include even a passing breath of
hot air.
After a comparatively quiet and
hopeful week, the Eastern question
has suddenly presented a bloody
phase. The unfortunate Armenians,
who have been the hunted of all the
races, are being butchered again aft
er the same fashion with which the

of Topulism.
Are you willing to make a small
sacrifice for the sake of a great prin
ciple?
Os course you are.
Not only willing, but anxious.
Now is the time!
Our campaign is almost at the
close, hundreds of dollars are need
ed to send out literature and speak- -
ers, and our Committee is out of
funds.
They know the reason as well as
you could tell them. They realize
that the panic of last fall hit us all
a hard blow; that the cotton we have
made is yet unsold and the price
proclematical; and that another win
ter will soon be here with all its de
mands upon every householder.
Nevertheless —we are fighting for
our lives now, against a repetition of
such panics; for prices which will
not be problematical, for a fair liv
ing and a square deal for all.
If you don’t register your protest
against the evils which beset us —
your children will never rise above
the condition of the starving thous
ands during the panic.
In every other country on the
globe where the radicals have regis
tered their protest, it has been heed
ed. It will be heeded by our govern
ment today.
Help us to rouse our neighbors,
who are only lukewarm, to real en
thusiasm. Give ns whatever talent
you have.
There is something each one can
do. If you can speak, talk to the
people. If you can write, send let
ters to us and to your friends. If
you can send some money, do so at
oncd. Don’t hesitate because you
can’t subscribe some big sum. Think
press have made us sickeringly famil
iar of late years. Turkey and Bulgaria
are apt to clash at any moment and,
from a peaceable adjustment through
arbitration, of all the questions at is
sue between Europeans and Otto
mans, the situation now looks as
though the least provocation would
precipitate a war of unexampled sav
agery.
Forest fires continue in Michigan
and the Northwest. The line between
Canada and the United States has al
most literally been traced by black
ened streaks where fires have raged
from Maine to the Pacific slope and
in many places one can ride mile
after mile through nothing but the ut
ter desolation left by the flames.
Atlanta is getting ready to wel
come the old “boys in gray” and
give them the time of their lives. If
the ideal Indian Summer weather
continues, there will be nothing fur
ther to ask.

it over. Can you afford NOT to do
your part? Don’t wait for 1 ‘some
body else to do something”!
You can invite a speaker to your
home and save him hotel bills. You
can get together in little groups and
‘ ‘ chip in ’ ’ to help pay his expenses.
You can send us a few postage
stamps, if nothing else.
Populism is not politics. It is
the religion of good government, and
its claims are as sacred as those of
your church, your life insurance com
pany, your lodge—any of the institu
tions you uphold because you think
they are RIGHT —because you be
lieve they are doing GOOD.
The American people were never
yet appealed to on behalf of a prin
ciple of right in vain. We do not be
lieve they will show themselves self
ish or indifferent to their cause now.
You who have tickets, be sure to
distribute them. Take a day or two
and go about and work for Justice,
Cleanliness, White Supremacy and
the SOUTH.
Is the spirit of the Sixties dead or
sleeping? NO! Then, you, sons and
daughters of those who gave their
ALL for their cause and your rights
as their children, will not fail to give
SOMETHING for your cause and the
thousands to come after you!.
Send your contributions and en
couragement to those who are work
ing, day and night, at a loss to them
selves, for the People’s Party and all
that it means.
Headquarters are at 709 Temple
Court, Atlanta, Ga. Chairman J. J.
Holloway and Secretary Bodenhamer
will welcome you personally, and be
grateful for your aid.
