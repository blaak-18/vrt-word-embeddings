Editor POPULIST :
Examine the Enterprise of 10th
inst. under the head of "every t
one wondering." Truly that sen
timent is so startling as to make 1
every one wonder. Is it possible t
that in a civilized community such
threats mean anything i
This voting after they are dead
business has helped to kill the
Democratic party and reduced it
to this extremity; they confess
their weakness when they threat I
en such things. Away with such
practice and with the party that
descends so low as to hold out such '
a menace, even in such an extremi- t
ty like the present.
Let every true American rise in
his might and rob that Democratic
machine as it is called, of its hor- I
rors, and teach the manuaers, these
tfakes and crookslu, that there is a
lice force strong enough to han- I
I them, and a court in which to a
try and condemn them, vis : pub- I
lic opianon. That there is a way
which seemeth good unto men, but I
the end whereof is death.
Are you a man of kouor, and (
would you stand tamely by and I
see an atrocious outrage perpetra
tedonmmher Verilyno. Then I
you eannot atord to support that
party stesped in sob vices as that I
article suggests thereby not only I
makin :oursel a spectator, but a I
party nthereto.
This ame Democratic machine
r with it infernal policy of total
i fga or the rwashes of a pil- t
ag d outraged people has
ie t neeosary to organize along a
the rInes of government marked a
out by the pure unsophisticated c
Jeferson, in order to assert what I
little liberty isleft us, viz : to vote. t
Shall we see this struck down by c
the marandang hand of a foe we r
--ve already fed to gluttony I No! I
them is too mueh blood yet left in a
the poor scked veins of thepeo- a
ple.
Out to the poll every man of
Lnor mand fair dealing, vote our .
Meket, the result will be taken care
of, seh threats to the contrary
mDlwildtandiag.
If the writer of that article
wibesto mknow who lies and what *
a--tthy ayue it of, if te will ex- (
amine the l that should be the
hert it killad Democratic c
nt,. he will he able to de

names on the rolls, including inva
lids, widows, orphans and de1pen
dent i)arents, the annual amnount
on the rolls being 6155,;.,04.
That in 1P., there will be dropped
front the rolls 44,932 pensioners
with an increasing ratio thereafter.
Referring to the complaint against
widow, pensiions, he shows that if
all wildows' claims yet undisposed
of are a:lowed, there will be 709,
s-53 dead soldiers unpresented on
the rolls by a widow, an orplhan or
a dependent parent. lie also
I pints out the danger to the treas
ury fronl war claims, and says con
gress has the data to show that
about ;0 ,01(,0)t44 may vet Ibe
drawn fromt it to satisfy tlicir de- I
mands.
Mr. Henderson refers to the de
feat of the bankrupt bill in the
house ; the hurial of the pure food
bill; the slaughter of the anti-op
tion bill ; its inability to grapple
with the money question : its silent
admiration of the McKinley bill, I
and predicts that the fifty-second
congress will go down to history
as the "Kno-Nothing and Do- 1
Nothing Congress."
Our esteemed contemporary, t he
Plaquemines Protector, mnakes
albout the most candid I)emocratic
bid for the Negro vote that has yet
come under our observation. Com
menting upon the action of the
Behan committee in refusing the
offer of fusing with the old-limne
Republicans, the Protector says:
"So the white Republicans are o)p
posed to the Negroes in politics,
who will find their best friends to
be Democrats." The inference to
be drawn from this is that the best
friends of the Negroes are those
who encourage his particip)ation in
polities-a proposition which the
National Republicans reject-and
that the Democrats, who have urg
ed the fear of Negro supremacy as t
a primal reason why white nmen i
should remain united in the Demo
cratic ranks, are ready to curry
favor with the Negro vote in order
to carry the comning election. Ae
cusations to this effect have been a
recently circulated through anti- I
Democratic channels, but a quasi t
admission of their truth from such r
a source as the Protector was r
scarcely looked for.-Donaldson-r

Oct. 19th, 1895, of swanip fever,
MINNIE OLA PHArIS, daughter of
Elijah S. and SusiE Pharis.
Little Minnie was called from
earth to heaven while but a child.
The .Saviour who said, "Suffer lit
tle children to come unto me and
forbid them not, for of such is the
kindom of heaven," has called
for this precious one and has taken
her unto himself. Eibht bright
summers were all she knew, but oh
how full of happiness these were,
to all who knew her. Meek, sub
missive, obedient--a child whose
memory is a sweet incense to the
parents, who will always think of
her as a precious little flower let
down from heaven to make cheer
fiul and happy their home for a few
brief years.
A little bud from the Master's
flower-garden has been plucked,
but it shall bloom in that other
realm and there make fragrant the
habitation of the redeemedof earth.
May the parents so sorely bereft,
be enabled even in their affiction to
say, "The Lord hath given .and
the Lord hath taken away, blessed
e the name of the Lord.
