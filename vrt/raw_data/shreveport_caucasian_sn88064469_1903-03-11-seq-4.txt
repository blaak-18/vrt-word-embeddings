1e Petition Asks Case Azainst the Fort

pany et Al. Be Once More
2 Given a Hearing.
Washington. March 11.-The Cattle
Raisers' Association of Texas com
plainant, and the Chicago Livestock
r- Exchange, intervenor, have filed with
ce the interstate commerce commission
e, a petition for the reopening of the case
against the Fort Worth and Denver
Railway company and others, nivolv
E ing through rates on livestock and ter
e minal charges of $2.00 per carload for
i delivering livestock at the stockyards
a of the Union Stockyards and Transit
!r company cf Chicago. The petition re
cites that the committtee already had
held that any charge in excess of $1
per carload for terminal or switching
service was unlawful, and then recites
*d subsequent contest proceedings before
the courts and commission. The peti
tion asks not only the enforcement of
the discontinuance of terminal chargeS
over $1 per carload, but the continua
tion of the practice of enforcing dis
h criminating through rates for the
transportation of live stock from the
shipping points involved, and the
proper reparation to the parties in
Jured for the alleged unlawful terminal
charges and through rates of freight
2 on livestock to the Chicago stockyards.
:e The commission has modified the par
d ties interested to make answer within
the prescribed period of twenty days
BRYAN TALKS.
Says He Is Surprised Congress Did Not
Vote Out All Money.
Toledo, 0., March 11.--Colonel W.
J. Bryan said referring to his recent
visit to New York that the people
there knew less about politics than
western people knew.
"They asked me about Judge Park
er," he said, "and I told them I could
say nothing until I .knew his attitude
on public questions. They answered
that he was a judge and that it would
not be proper for him to discuss po
litical topics. I think Hill is tossing
a penny to see whether he or Judge
Parker will run. The trouble with
the plan is that Hill has an old penny
that he has tossed so often that he
does not know which side is head and
which is tail.
"What congress has done is easily
qacertalned. Find out how, much
there was in the treasury before the
session began and find out how'nmuch
there is now. The wonder is that they
did not take it all.
"I believe the Democratic party has
taken the peoples' side of the public
-questions discussed in 1896 and 1900,
and I believe that it will be only a
question of time and not a long time
either, before enough Republicans will
be disgusted with the policy of the
Republican party to put the Democrat
party in power again.
"Such a' victory when will bring re
lief to the people. We cannot win a
victory by compromise or cowardice
'and if we should win a victory by
such means it would be as disastrous
to the party as Mr. Cleveland's victory
in 1892 proved to be."
ANXIETY AT NATCIHEZ.
!ear Is Expressed That Levees May Not
Show Their Strength.
Natchez, Miss., March 11.-Anxiety
here is at' a strong tension through
fear that the levees may not be allow
ed to show their strength as there
may be a cut at some place to save
property on the opposite side from the
cut. This danger is as much a source
of apprehension as is the high stage
of the river and the water which is
yet to come.
The, Mississippi at this point is two
feet one-tenth above the danger line
and r.sing. Heavy rains are of daily
recurrence. The ground is water
soaked and all the water is .going in
to the, river.

Sleeping on a Kosg.
China is a land without mattres8l
or counter;,anes. A bed, or kong, Is
merely a broad wall of brick built
across the side of the room. On first
acquaintance it seems absolutely im
possible for an Anglo-Saxon, but a man
In the interior of China must either
sleep on a kong or not sleep at all. I
determined that if the bricks would
not yield to me I must yield to them,
and, as a means of yielding gracefully,
I studied the sleeping methods of my
Chinese companions. I found that
their practice was to climb inside of
quilted sacks, called pookas, which
they tied and folded around themselves
until a row of men on a kong looked
not unlike sealed envelopes. Whenever
they rolled or turned over in their. sleep
their pookas rolled with them. In
whatever position they happened to lie
on the brick pile they could not escape
the ameliorating effect of their pookas.
Obviously I, too, must have a pooka.
From a dealer in leather ini a town
through which we.passed I bought two
goatskins. I had them sewed together,
with the hair side in. I devised a sys
tem of strings by which I could tie my
self in my appliance, and in this way
I succeeded in sleeping in China.-4)ut

Rapid Work F'or Fingers.
The deaf and dumb, as every one
knows, "speak" by means of their fin
gers. How many words, then, can a
good hand speaker form in a minute?
The average number of letters per
word in the English language is five.
Now, a ready hand speaker can make
the English alphabet ten times in a
minute-that is to say, 260 letters. It
is usual for him to pause for the space
of one letter after each word to show
that the word is complete. If, there
fore, we subtract from the total just
given about one-sixth for these stop
pages, the total will be reduced to 215
letters.
Let this be divided by five, the aver
age number of letters per word, and
we shall find that a fairly expert deaf
and dumb person will speak forty-three
words per minute. A person in pos.
session of speech will probably speak
150 words in the same space of time.
Substitutes For Tobacco.
Dried holly leaves, the bark of the
willow-and leaves of the stag's horn
sumac are among the substitutes for
tobacco used by the American Indians.
In Switzerland a weed called mountain
tobacco is smoked in great quantities.
It is powdered before using and causes
the smoker to become a mental and
physical wreck. The natives of South
Africa are peculiarly-affected by smok
ing the dried leaves of the camphor
plant. The smoker trembles with
fright at nothing, weeps bitterly and
uses all sorts of words which do not in
the least express his meaning. The
wild dagga, another South African
plant, poisons slowly any one using it.
h Selling Elephaant by Meamure.
y The Moors, who drive a trade -in ele

e der, and for each cubit high they
I charge $500. An African elephant of
the largest size measures about nine
cubits, or thirteen and one-half feet, in
-height and is worth about $4,500. For
a huge Ceylon elephants $20,000 is some

s Reply of a "Beardless Boy."
Y Whel Keppel, a commodore at twen

The Word "Umbrella."
The English word umbrella is very
like the Latin, coming through the
Italian "ombbrella," or "little shade."
The French, German, Spanish and oth
ers givq it a distinctive. name, such as
S"paraplule," "regensehirm" &nd '"ra
guas." "Umbrella" and "parasol" are
etymologically precisely the same tlng,
but custom has given them the distine
tions that we understand today.

FATAL FIElRY FLAES
People Gathered to See Oil B1urning
4aused by Train Wrecl
EXPLOSIONS ENSUED.
Fulty a Score of Lives Were Lost by
the Terrible 4oncnssion, and the
Number Injured Are About
Twice That Many.
Olean, N. Y., March 11.-From eight
een to twenty lives were lost and
fully twice that numiber burned or
bruised by the explosion of oil late
Monday night following the wreck on
the Erie railroad north of this city.
Owing to the fact that some of the
bodies were incinerated in the fierce
flames, or blown into Olean creek by
the fierce explosion the exact number
of dead will probably not be known
ofr several days. The number of in
Jured, too, is uncertain, as a large
number of them were able to reach
home and receive treatment there. The
known dead are as follows: Norman
Brown, Olean; Johnny Tobin, Olean;
Johnny McCready, Olean; John McMa
hon, Olean. All four are boys about
sixteen years eld. M. V. Drisnoll.
North Olean; Walter Swift. Olean;
John Smellinger, Olean; Harry God
den, Boardmanville; Richard Connell,
North Olean. Six unidentified bodies
are at Woodward's undertaking rooms.
A boy was blown into Olean creek and
drowned. His body has not been re
covered. Two or more unknown per
sons were incinerated in the burned
wreckage.
At the hospital one of the patients
said a boy was blown into the creek
near him. He tried to save the lad.
but was unable to do so. The boy
drowned.
The scenes following the explosion
will never be forgotten by those who
saw them. It was about 9 o'clock in
the evening when the train was
wrecked. An Erie freight train west
bonud broke in two on a hill two miles
north of the city.
At first the forward part of the
train, released of all weight of the cars
behind, sprang forward with increased
speed. The brakes were applied and
the front brought almost to a stand
stilt at the iron bridge across Olean
creek. The rear cars gathering mo
mentum as they came down the hill,
crashed into the forward part of the
train. Most of the cars of the train
were tank cars filled with refined oil
or gasoline. They weighed thousands
of tons, and the impact was terriflic.
One tank car aught fire soon after the
collision. The exact cause of the fire
is not kaowni; but it is supposed to
have started from a spark struck from
grinding pieces of iron in the wreck
age. In a few moments another car of
gasolene caught fire and burst into
flames with a terrific report. Portions
Of the iron domes of the cars were
hurled a distance of several hundred
feet. The flames shot high up in the
air, presenting a brilliant spectacle. In
this early accident, so far as can be
learned, no one was injured.
A large crowd quickly gathered.
Hundreds of people from Olean, North
Olean and the surrounding country
gathered to watch the brilliant play of
the flames. For two-houirs people stood
massed together, and as the heat be
came less intense the crowd began to
edge a little closer to the wreckage,
until about 11 o'clock some venture
some boys approached to within a few
hundred feet of the burning debris.
Suddenly .there was a terrific explo
sion. Great masses of white flames
shot hundreds of feet into the air and
literally rolled down the banked sides
of the track into the gully where
spectators were standing. Men and
boys fell before the wave of white
light to rise no more. Hugt pieces of
iron were hurled through teh air,
mowing down human Beings by the
scores. Some managed to scramble to
their feet and get away, but others lay
still in death. A veritable rain of'Ore
came down upon the crowd. Men and
boys with their clothing a mass of
fames ran shrieking down the track,
some At them falling on the ground
uncosacious, while others grovelled in
the ditch or jumped into the creek in
an endeavor so put out the fire from
consuming them. Many of those over
whelmed by the' ames dropped where
they stood and never again moved. Ais
soon as a telephone could be reached
all the doetors in the city *ere sum
mo"ed end ambulances called out.
