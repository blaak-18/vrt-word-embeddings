Our Next Member of Congress.
The Convention to nominate a mem
ber of Congress from the Fourth
Congressional District of Louisiana,
will soon assemble. When we re
member how discreditably and shame
fully we have been represented, or
rather, misrepresented, at Washing
ton, for the last six years, by the
nominees of a party who were guided
in their choice mete by the question
able character of their candidate, than
by the essential requisite of integrity
and capacity; when we reflect that
the world is apt to form its opinion
of our people, by the public conduct
and mental caliber of the imported
dunces and knaves, who have been
sent to the national capital to repre
sent them, by the united efforts of
ignorant negroes, contemptible car
pet-baggers and hypocritical scala
wags, it devolves upon us, who
represent the white element, the only
intelligeit and honest portion of our
people of this State, to make such a
selection as will reflect the sentiments
of our people in their true ight.
The very nature of such an exalted
and honorable position requires far
more experience and knowledge of
the principles of government, and of
the wants of the people, than may be
requisite for members of a State Leg
islature. For the latter, an ordinary
knowledge of local interests and
opinions may generally suffice. But
it is far different with a member of
Congress. It is his duty to legislate
for the interest and welfare, not of
one State only, but of all the States.
It is not enough that he should pos
sess upright intentions and a sounad
judgment; he must, by a proper
training of thought and stAdy, be a
competent master of all the objects
on which he may be called upon to
legislate; he must have the skill and
ability to apply his acquired knowl
edge in the best manner, and to the
greatest interest of the Republie. In
a single State, the habits, manners,
customs, Institutions and laws, are
about the same, and a respectable
member of its citizens are more or
less conversant with them. In a
commonwealth, the various pursuits
sad occupations of the people are
well known and easily ascertained.
The general affairs of a State i sin
a comparatively small sphere, and
are talked about, examined and dis
cussed, by those whese interests they
arect, sad whose opinioes, by .e
quent communication, are daily in
terchanged. But it is quite different
with the affairs of the general gov
erment. There every measure must
be diacumsd with a d regard to the
want, interests, rights and pursuits of
all the Statesr. We are now, thirty
sight States in the Union, having dif
ferent laws, customs, elimate sad
predacts. Some of them arealmost
wholly agricultral some commer
c-at; some manufacturing, sad othersm
haver a mixtre of alli; nad in no two
of them are there, the preeisely rela

The Delegates of the White Citi
zens of the State of Louisiana, who
assemble at Baton Rouge in Conven
tion, on the 24th inst., are accrtdited
with great powers, and have resting
upon them the grave responsibility of
eanmciating a platform of principles,
which will reconcile all persons and
parties opposed to the Kellogg usur
pation. This accountability becomes
doubly responsible when takes. in
connection with the fact that so many
vital issues depend upon our success
in this canvass.

given deep thought to the magnitude

do feel the grinding fores of this
monstrous iniquity under which they

them by their Maker in representing
a superior race and a superiortivlii

of their wives and little ones, are
staked upon the issue of this battul,

Democratic or Republcan.
We are surprised that our friends
of the New Orleans Bl.Eci, should
swallow the baited book of the Be
p.1e., in its artticle on the "Posi
tion of Parties." We have carefully
read the extract to which it invites
attention, and to give the same op
portualty to our readers we copy it
in fall, as followst t
Conservatives, on the contrary, here as
elsewhere, are those who cling to the
past, who have a superstitious reverence.
for whatever is old because it is old, and
a distrust of whatever is new because it
is new; who accomplish no work except
of an obstructfve kind, and are by nature
incapacitated for improvement, being as
has been wittily said, "the mules of poli
ties that engender nothing."
In this State they do not constitute a
political subdivision, but when they act
politically at all are obliged to fall into
the Democratic ranks, as their opposites,
the Liberals, have no ebhoice but to act
with the IRepublican party. In fact there
are but two patties in this State. the
Republican party, and their opponents,
the Demoeratic party. Between these
two thets ca be no compromise, and the
attempt to get together as an army the
miserable stragglers from either, rein
forced by the indolent, the indifferent
and the stupid, and set such a corpora's
guard up as a third party, having the,
balance of power, will prove a miserable
failure.
Those who wish to defeat the Republi.
can party must join the Democratic, or
waste their strength; and thoe 'to whom
the name of Democracy is an offense
must take sides with the Reptblicans.
There is no middle course, no "Liberal
Conservative" organization, claiming
support and offering assnrance of suc
eeos. Monsters never do succeed, and
"lileral conservatism," could sach a
thing exist, would be a monster, with
wings vainly beating the air, and feet of
clay chained to the everlasting rocks by
the adamantine bands of prejudice.
As the Bullkein declares it cannot
see "how there can be any hesitation
on the part of the white people what
party they should join,' we are as
much at a less to understand why
the white people should be so hasty
to join the Democratic party, simply
becaase the Repablmem, the paid jour
nal of the very thieves we are war
ring on, should think it good policy.
The tenor of the above extract al
ludes simply to a conservative atti
tude of the people, or the success
likely to attend a movement having
for its plan a policy or. affilition line
of action. Now this is just as far
from the contemplated and expressed
plan of the White Man's or People's
party of ousina, asu can be. We
have sever stigpated thatthis should
be a pm and simple wuhey-washey
battle, on the eeatrary; we have de
elaed that this was apeople' move

slements sad purpose of an Ineguaut

gard to pat potii affiliations, a
movemeat sa which the eo-operatim

Do not aeeptany Democratic doe
trine, we enttest, the Republican may
preach, rather "go by contranes," aad
we venture you will be nearer the
mark. We anxiously look for the
selection of our candidates by that
journal, and then we know we will sue
ceed.
Let the )Blletii carefully read this
extract from the Republican of the
6th, and it will see that that journal
is somewhat eratic in regard to who
and what constitute Democrats and
White Leagers.
The recent letter of Colonel John Me
Enery, dated Monroe, July 30, 1l74, to a
friend in this city, renders it very clear
that the White League organizations in
this State are nothing but branches of
the Democratic party. Referring to a
communication orginating in North Lou
isiana, signed by bimself and ether citi
reas of that section, and addressed to the
Democratic Central Committee at New
Orleans, Colonel McEnery says:
My purpose was to create the very re
verse of the feeling which seems to have
sprung up in n sr city umom thi publica
tion of the doeument in question. In
view of the dissensior I saw arising in
many parishes, I thought that the sug
gestions and recommendations contained
in that doeument would allay those dis
sensions, and present the white people
of the State in one unbroken phalanx to
radicalism, which, in the parlance of all
right thinking ppople of Louisiana,
means the spoiliation and robbery, under
legal forms, of their property and all
their substance.
The above extract very clearly demon
strates that we are not mistaken in com
ing to the conclusion that the White
League organizations are branches of the
Democratic party-he purpose of the
two organizations being really the same,
the defeat of the Republican party in
every Soethern State throegQ violence,
and its final overthrow in the other States
of the Union and the re-establishment of
the Democratic party in authority at
Washington.
White Men Attentian.
It has come to oar knowledge that
the man Van Dasen is more vile, a
thousand times than we have repro.
sented him to be. That his teachings
to the negroes of the Third Ward
have been pernicious we believe with
oat a doubt. Last week a warrant
was sued out for his arrst, charging
him with riotous conduct, and en
deavoring to incite the colored men
to murder and rapine, and what
makes this charge ap strong is that
the af darit is swo to a& tAe colore
-me, all semeeted mitlh the Republies
party in his Ward.
We are informed by these parties
that he advocated an extreme line of
policy for them to persue in their
coiduct with the whites, which they
properly and promptly refused to do,
whereupon he had them expelled
from the Radical clubs, upon the
charge of being in league with the
whites. Not UtideeB with this, he
has them arrested and bound over to
keep the peace, sad during the dsit

New Re~istration Law.
We cannot see that any of the ',u
merons "official organs" of this State,
have, with anything like indecent
haste, thrown themselves into tLe
breach and defended the iniquity ,f
the oe registration law, and the con
duct of their master in signing it.
That this law is scarcelydefensible,
no obe will deny, for it bears upon its
face the attempt to disfranchise a
large number of our foreign white
citizens, clbgging their right to reg
ister and vote with quibbles and eva
sions and gives more power over the
naturalization of a citizen than the
courts themselves. There is no pro
tection of the rights of honest citizens,
nor does it prevent fraudulent vo
ters of the negro element from en
joying that blessing allowed him, to
the detriment of the white man, for
it is an admitted fact that more fraud
have existed, which required special
enactments if anything did, in the
registration of negroes under age,
long since dead, or who had never ex
isted, than could possibly have taken
place by manipulating the naturali
ration laws, for tlje courts were all in
the han ds of the Radical faction, and
have been for the past seven years,
and what fraudulent papers of citi
zenship that exist, if any do, have
been issued by their courts, and for
their benetit. We venture to say that
no foreigner who is willing to vote
with the Kellogg party in November
next, will be refused registration
whether he is a citizen or not, and be
will be accommodated with naturali
sation papers that will secure his reg
istration without cavil.
o
One point, we think, has been over
looked by oar city cotemporaries is this
act, and it is a feature that demand
ventilation. Those are the clauses of
the registration act which refer direct
ly to the conduct of the election, and
embraced in article 29 of the act. Here
it will be seen that the registrar, not
only revises and corrects the list of
qualified voters, but his powers are ex
tended to the appointment of conutis
sioer of election, constables during
the time of election, whoes duty it
shall be to "count the ballots cast"and
convey the boxes to and from the
place of holding the election. Although
Governor Kellogg has denied signing
the election bill, this registration law
embraces all the bad features of that
bill, and we will venture to say was
passed, as most of the bills of the last
General Assembly, after the adjourn
ment of that delectable body, was a
"made up" concern, embracing all
that was outrageous trnm both the
registration and election law, mid to
have been passed and signed and pro
mulgated as a kied of "eomprmise',
betweeen Kellogg and his own veranc
ity.
Our citiens are determined on one
thing, adthat is, that no power in
this State dall prmevent thema from
legally registering and voting, erm
ifwe have to employ force to asert
our right. Th sooner ellegg and
his minioais undertad this the better
fo all people. He les aid a fair
election is all hewanta to show that
be is sutaimed by the people, and we
intend by the mie aeas to prove to
the contrary.
