securities of the United States.
The public is being taxed, in freight
and passenger rates, to pay dividends on
this “watered stock.”
In other words, the people are taxed in
order that value may be put into stocks
and bonds which represent no honest in
vestment.
By this gigantic swindle, the people
have not only lost eight billions of dol
lars, but will have to pay dividends on it
as long as the present system of private
ownership lasts.
