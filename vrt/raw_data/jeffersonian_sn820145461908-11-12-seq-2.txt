THE DRIFTING SEAWEED.
Its Lesson for the Man Who Talks
About “Throwing Away My
Vote.’’
This is for the man who talks about
“throwing away my vote.”
This is for the man who would vote
like a. sheep, ami ho always with the
big herd.
Fortunately, some men are not
sheep, some men would rather be
light in the minority, than wrong in
the majority.
The only thing in a man’s vote is
the right, conquered after many cen
turies of struggle, to think and to
back up his thought with a vote.
What is your vote?
Isn’t your vote made to distinguish
you as a thinking man? Isn’t it the
weapon with which you can rebuke
the sheeplike action of thoughtless
voters and the dishonesty of leaders?
There is a very interesting story told
of the discovery of this country by
Columbus; you know that his men
were discouraged, and in mutiny. He
had sailed on .and on, across the sea
which the ignorant world then be
lieved to be unconquerable. Some of
his sailors were expecting at any mo
ment that their ship would roach the
edge and fall off —for that was the
belief then.
Columbus, looking over the bow of
his boat, saw floating on the water a
branch of seaweed, one that grows
clinging to the rocks on the shore’s
edge. When Columbus saw the weed
floating below his boat, although he
was still out of sight of land, he knew
that land was near. And from that
floating weed, separated from the rest
adrift on the ocean, he got the cour
age' and the inspiration to go on
ahead and win.
Here are a few verses from a poem
by Elizabeth Pullen that yon might
read to your friends that only want
to “vote with the winner”:
/
• The flying sea-bird mocked the float
ing dulse:
“Poor, wandering water-weed,
where dost thou go,
Astray upon the ocean’s restless
pulse?”
It said, “I do not know.
*«»*«■*
“A worthless weed, a drifting, broken
weed—
What can I do in all this boundless
sea ?
No creature of the universe has need
Or any thought of me.”
/
Hither and yonder, as the winds
. might blow,
The seaweed floated; then a ref
luent tide
Swept it along to meet a galleon’s
prow—
“ Land ho!” Columbus cried.
That piece of seaweed might have
clung to the rock with all the other
millions of weeds like it indefinitely
without over doing anything or any
body any good. It broke away from
the rock, away from the seaweed
crowd, and encouraged a great mind.
Exactly so with the man who votes
independently. He breaks away from
the old rock and the old crowd. He
goes off by himself. He may think,
and others may think, that his vote is
“lost,” just as that weed thought
itself lost in the ocean’s vastness.
P>ut. independence, thought fulness,
sincerity, are never lost. One single
man voting and acting independently
may be an inspiration to others, and
,'iis defeat may moan glorious victory
to follow.
I Link that over, voters, when you
talk about “throwing away your
vole.' When you stick like a sheep
in the flock, when you go with the
others automatically, then indeed, you
are throwing away your vote.
But when you vote as an honest,
thinking, independent man, you arc
proving that the men who gave up
■their lives to secure universal suffrage
were not wasting their time, their
lives and their blood.
Voters, think for yourselves and
vote as you think. —New York Ameri

THE DREAD MASTER.
No singing chord of youth was dumb,
No star of youth was dim;
It seemed so long ere age should come,
I kept light watch for him —
Light watch o’er heart, and nerve and
eye,
His entrance evermore —
And, Io! the shadow, stealing by,
Found an unguarded door!
I dreamt of far-off fields well
fought,
Fierce battle, victory bright;
“I shall have praise from him,” I
thought,
“Who taught me first to fight.”
Then I remembered! as a breath
Blows the dry rose apart;
For, lo! the sudden touch of death
Had aged me to the heart!
—John Erskine, in Century Maga
zine.
LIFE AND HABITS.
It is well to stop and reflect some
times on the influence of habit on our
lives. From an article on the sub
ject in an Eastern paper we take the
following:
“Mark Twain’s humor is habit,
based on a natural tendency in that
direction. Some may prefer to call it
study. Very well. Study is habit.
Ln til the habit is fixed, how perplex
ing! Afterward, it is like breathing.
“The minister’s brilliant pictures
of holy life; the lawyer’s masterly
logic; the doctor’s training to con
quer disease, and the commercial
traveler’s versatility and jocularity
arc all habits. At first they were
not. Repetitions grooved the chan
nels. Good habits are priceless, in
pleasure and greatly increased effi
ciency. Bad habits lead to jungles.
The importance of early, harmonious
habits can not be overestimated.
“Objectionable habits are over
come abruptly or gradually, The
3effersonlan
former is the better way. Where the
will power is sadly weakened the un
fortunate person must resort to the
latter course. Tn too many instances
it is still lacking.
“When working in the Lyons’
lowa, postofilce, back in the war
times, a lawyer there, finely cultivated
and exceedingly gentlemanly, had an
excessive whiskey habit. He hadn’t
enough will power either to stop
drinking or to change his vocation.
One morning, coming into the office
for his mail, he said: ‘Mr. Baldwin,
my father was a lawyer and he made
me a lawyer. Had I been a maga
zine writer I would have been a suc
cess, and not the drunkard that I now
am. ’
“A superintendent of a public
school says: ‘Oftentimes those who
are dullest in the school blossom
out into men and women who do
the greatest work in the world.
The reason is they find work
which interests them after leav
ing school, and try to do their
best in what they do. In school the
work they had failed to appeal to
them, failed to awaken their intellec
tual powers. This case is suggestive
of the importance of manual training,
domestic and many other depart
ments. Certain children do not come
to like books in general till many
years later. The public school system
is grand, but it is vet far from being
perfected.
“Carrying the hands in the pockets
is habit. How little is considered of
the power of habit for joy or sorrow,
weal or woe. It makes or unmakes,
manhood. It causes study, caution
and frugality; or indifference, care
lessness and wreckage. It is a stanch
ship or a tumble-down building.
“Before twenty years is the plastic
age. The home, the whole family, in
its royal estate, is yet scarcely out of
the milk period. Outside institutions
make no such lasting impressions on
the children. A slovenly childhood
speech is rarely perfected.
“How refinement and naturalness
can ever come together is yet an un
solved problem. The gulf may possi
bly be bridged. For health laws, the
lower animals are wiser. Science
teaches that all habit has a physical
basis. This is a wide departure from
the ancient teaching. Herbert Spen
cer says, ‘first made the child a good
animal. ’
“Man has many times more habits
than the lower animal. The larger
part is acquired and, very unfortun
ately, they are mostly artificial. There
must be a new philosophy if the
birthright of health ami vitality is
to be maintained.
“The educated thoughtlessly find a
volume of faults with the ignorant
There is another side to this question.
The ignorant are’the balance wheel
of the government. It checks selfish
ness. It is a useful, conservative ele
ment. It prevents the children of the
poor f:om destroving the children of
the rich, it modifies the hard ways
of life. It obviates the mixing of the
social strata. It is an element of
peace and stability.
“After being accustomed to the
daily paper it causes a falling sense
to miss it.” —The Opelika Morning
Post. ;
TOLSTOY’S WIFE LED HIM.
How much of the success and in
fluence of Count Tolstoy has been
due to his wife? The Countess has
been content to remain in obscurity,
while she has watched her husband
progress from a rake to recognition
as one of the few really ruling minds
of his day. She was only a slip of
a girl, the daughter of a Moscow phy
sician, when she was married to Tol
stoy in 1861. He then w-Ts 33 years
old, and bis life up to that time had
been one of dissipation. His wife
must have been the steadying power,
for his first serious work in the up
building of his fame was begun im
mediately after his marriage. He
took his bride to the family estate in
Poliania. He had run the estate into
bankruptcy, and the couple made
their home in a peasant’s hut.
Twenty years passed before she re
turned to Moscow. She raised a
family of seventeen children and edu
cated them herself. Today, with her
hair white, she acts as her husband’s
secretary, typewriting his manu
scripts sometimes half a dozen
times. In more than one way this
woman is more remarkable than her
illustrious husband, and a multitude
of persons will believe her life carries
a deep rebuke to those women who
live alone for the frothy pleasures of
society.—New York Press.
THAT UPLIFT COMMISSION.
President Roosevelt’s commission,
appointed to ascertain the drawbacks
of farm life and to find means to re
move them, has determined, it ap
pears, to study conditions in the
South down to and including Georgia
before it hurries back to the neigh
borhood of the White House. Ala
bama, Mississippi and the Southwest
are to be left unvisited by the com
mission.
This slight will, however, be far
given if the commission can devise
plans that will render farm life more
attractive. Alabama can apply to
herself what may be desired for Geor
gia and the Carolinas. But in these
days of telephones and rural free de
livery the farmer can devise for him
self all needful remedies of the situa
tion. The truth is, if Alabama could
by magic be equipped in a night with
bal'd macadam roads all complaints
ot isolation and social deficiencies on
the farms would disappear. The lack
of trustworthy means of communica
tion lies at the bottom of farm dis
content. We need, in other words,
not so much the plans of the uplift
commission as we need good roads
and the Overton amendment.
The hope is that the Overton
amendment was ratified by the peo
ple .on yesterday, and if it was we
need not feel bad if the Bailey com
mission does decline to study farm
conditions in Alabama.—-Birmingham
