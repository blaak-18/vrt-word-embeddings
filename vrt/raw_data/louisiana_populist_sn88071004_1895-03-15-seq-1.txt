What would you think of a far
mer with broad acres of the most
fertile lands, with all the buildings
machinery and stock he wanted,
and each year producing so much
of everything that it burdened him
I say what would you think of such
a farmer continually going into
debt to another farmer who had
only a measly small farm, mostly
noted for its rocks andl worn out
soil-getting into his debt to such
an extent that all the produce of
his farm was absorbed in interest
annuallyl You would say such a
big farmer was a fool or insane,
would you not? So say I. Well,
that is just exactly the relation of
IUncle Sam and his big farm to
John Bull and his old worn-out
island. It does not change the. re.
lation because the number is in
creased-notat all The Ameri
cans are just as ignorant, just as
greatdupee as the great farmer
would be. The Americans are so
"stuck" on themselves and their
istitation~sf, that they believe the
gods could make no improvement
,irthemn, and they are therefore as
askl ned as school children.

Addre%% to the People ofr the
United Male.. ,
The signers of the )ceclaration
of Indeplendence hehl that a de
cent, respectable opinion of man
kind required that reasons should
be given for dissolving the bonds
that had 1 cund tle colonies to
Great Britain, so we will find it
necessary to sever our relations
with the political parties with I
which we have heretofore acted,
and form new alliances in a coin
mon cause, and deem it proper
that someic of the reasons which im
pels to this ation should be sub
imiitted to a candid public.
The monetary refotrm for which
we contend, as above set forth, is,
in our jjudgment, so vital to the
colnmon welfare and so necessary
to a return to conditions of pros
perity in this country, as to pre
clude longer delay in the inaugu
ration of a movement, the purpose
of which is to bring together all
who believe in the necessity of the
proposed reform for this object and
this alone. Those in tavor of the
gold standard are and have been
united in purpose and action. Par
ty lines do not divide them when
this issue is raised- Differences on
other questions are then laid asid,
and together they "in well-be
seeming ranks march all one way."
On the other hand, those who
are in favor of a return to the con
stitutional standard of gold and
silver, are split into as many di
visions as there are parties.. Sil
ver Republicans from the west aifd
south, to the great delight of the
leaders of the -Republican party,
insist on contending for their cause
only within the lines of their party;
and southern and western Demo
crats, earnest silver men, equally
to the delight of the leaders of the
I)emocratic party, continue the
contest on their part, only within
the lines of the Democratic party.
In other words, the advocates of
the bimetallic standard, through
the unrestricted coinage 'of silver
as well as gold, now conten& or
their cause in organizations which
are controlled by the gold party.
Hence, however zealous in the
cause one may be, no results are
possible because his party refuses
to carry out his views or to per
mit them to be carried out. It is
believed that there are now, and
have been for twenty years, a large
majority of the voters in the Unit
ed States in favor of restoring the
free coinage of both gold and sil.
ver, but the opportunity to vote
their convictions has never been
given them, and they have been
t continually thwarted by party chi
; canery.
º There has not been a congress
a for twenty years, except for the in
k fluence of the executive patronage
i or the fear of an executive veto,
that would not have votel to open
I the mints again to silver on the
rsame terms as to gold. Indeed
Seach house of congress has at dif
Sferent times separately passed free
Scoinage bills, but this action has
t often been frustrated by party
manipulation. It is as necessary,
therefore, to have a president in
sympathy with the causes as to
Shave a congress in favor of it.
But enough has been said to
t show the impossibility of gaining
our cause as long as we remain di
Svided, or fight only in the ranks of
- the gold party, or in organinations
, controlled by the advocates of the
r gold standard. As well might our
fathers have expected to win the
independenee of the colonies if
while contending for the cause of
t liberty they had refused to sepa
, rate from the teries.
- Independence could never have
been won by fighting for liberty In
SBritish regiments.
s And, fellow-citizens, this great
e cause will never be won witho.
a uited adtion. It will never be
won adnless thlee who believe in it
come together and elect a congress tl
and a president on this issue. it
There is no holpe whatever that tl
the Republican party, as a party, v
will change its policy, give up the o
gold standard and restore the bi- A
metallic, standard. There are no ,
grounds for such a hope and we be- ,
lieve they are deluded who look r
for such a change of policy by this ,ý
party. The Repuldican party is o
committed by its leaders, by its
record and by the press behind it
to the gold standards supported S
by gold bonds and to the retire
ment of the greenbacks and the
surrender of the issue and control
of paper currency to the banks.
No less persistent and effective
is the control of the money power t
over the organization of the Dem
ocratic party. While, undoubted
ly a large majority of the members s
of that party are opposed to the
gold standard, they have been
powerless to control the party or
ganization against it, and much
less to secure through it the resto
ration of the bimetallic standard.
While this is the case it cannot
be expected that Republicans will
abandon convictions of a lifttime '
on other questions and go into the I
Democratic party in a body, or into
a wing of that party; not will
Democrats give up convictions they
believe to be essential in govern
went and go over to the Republi- -
can party, or to a division of that I
party. Nor is it possible to induce
Republicans and Democrats to
gether to go into the populist par
ty for the reason, if for no other,
that the platform of that party
contains declarations and the par
ty advocates theories to which they
cannot give their assent. But we
must in some way come together
on this subject. No old party ever
3 carried through a great reform,
'"New bottles for new wine."
Therefore no course seems possible
f but to subordinate for the time be
iing other questions and come to
r gether in a new organization to
r fight the great battle of 1896 on
i the one great issue on which the
prosperity and happiness of the
Slpeople so largely depends. It is
a believed that this cause can be won
s in no other way and that to con
tinue to contend for it only within
s the lines of existing parties, is to
I court defeat at the outset and to
a lose the battle in the end.
The purpose of this movement
B is not to array section against sec
tion, nor class against class, nor to
e require anybody to give up his
n convictions on other questions or
I to sever his party relations for any
other purpose than to unite in a
common cause, the' cause of jus
s tice against injustice, of prosperity
instead of forced idleness, or abun
e dance and happiness instead of
, want and -misery.
n There can be no doubt, more
e ever, that a return to the standard
of gold and silver will promote in
Sthe highest degree the business
e interests of the entire country,
Swhile the continuance of the pres
I ent policy must necessarily be at
tended by a further fall of prices,
Simperiling business enterprises
0 still more and prolonging indefi
nitely the present stagnant condi
o tion of trade and industry. Better
Sprices under existing conditions
cannot m expected. A debtor na
tion cannot maintain an even level
of prices with creditor nations.
e The single gold standard can be
r maintained in the United States
Sonly by forcing down the price
level of commodities here enough
below the price level of other coun
tries to turn gold this way, or at
any rate to induce our creditors to
take commodities of the United
Statesfos what we owe them in
stead of demanding gold. Any
policy, therefore, that tends to
mie prioes nemesarily operates to
it expel gold. This condition of
things cannot he overcome by lfr
itfs, much less .by face trade. In
the payment of annual dues to oth
er countries we 1mu1st comixpete with
other debtor countries, with the
.Argentine, w ith Ev'pt, with India,
with all tnhe colonies of great Brit
an, and worst of all, with Asiasic
races, with industries stimulated
as never Ibefore by the low prise
of silver. These conditions from
which there is no escape as long as
the gold standard policy is pur
sued intensities the gravity of thit.
situation in this country to such all
extent as to compel the serious at
tention of all patriotic citizen-:
Hlow idle in the presence of such
conditions to expect to maintain
the gold standard by an indetinite
issue of Ionds, and how unwise, if
not reckless, such a policy must
seem to thoughtful men every
where. It is estimated that al
ready the rise of gold by increasing
dent:s has al)sorbd from , u , ,
no I to $51,1100,4,)1 of the World's
wealt Ih.
The inauguration of a movement
for relief from these enthralling
conditionsmust spring from the
peiople, politicians never institute
great reforms, and it was idle to
wait for them. This cause is the
cause of the people, and it is be
lieved that it more profoundly
concerns the welfare of the great
body of the people than any qules
tion since the civil war, if not in
deed since our independence was
gained, so in its ultimate outcome
the question of a sufficiency or scar
city of money is a question of free
- dom or serfdom for the mass of
" the people.
While not unmindful of the in:
r terests of the people of other coun
r tries in this question, it is not ad
issue that can be safely submitted
to the decision of foreign govern
e ments or be made to depend on?
what other countries may do or'
may not do. When our monetary
n system was established, over a
° hundred years ago, with a popula
B tion of less than 4,000,000, . our
a future did not wait for or invite
s the concurrence of other powers.
a Nor did the framers of the consti
tution contemplate any such action:
They legislated for the United
D States, and we now, as Americans,
must legislate for ourselves.
t Beware of entangling allianees
in this as in other matters, and es
' pecially of allurements of interna
tional conferences, to delay action
r in our own behalf in the delusive
, hope that other countries will care
for our interests better than wd
can ourselves.
V No other country has asked our
approval of its financial policy. It
f is believed that the United States
has power enough in the commer
cial world to alone restore the link
Sbetween gold and silver, broke in
S1873, but should gold for any reas
Son temporarily go to a premium, it
, will none the less operate on prices
- generally, and certainly a premiun'
Son gold here would, like a fall in
, the gold price of silver to slver
a countries, inure on every side td
Sthe advantage of the United States.
i. Fellow-citizens, the power is still
r in your hands to right by the bal
5 lot the great wrong of t1873, and to
s- save yourselves and your children
i from the thraldom which the golrd
;. stadarn policy, if persisted in,
e will surely bring upon you and
a them. We pray you, therefore,'
e not to let the settlement of this
h question go beyond the election of
-1896, but subordinating all ques
t tiods for the time being to thihf
