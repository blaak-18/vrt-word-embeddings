LETTER FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL
PIERREPOINT TO GOVERNOR
AMES.
Washington, September 16.
Tihe following dispatch has been
sent to Governor Allies.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
Washingtonl, Septei.kber 14. wh
To Governor Ames, Jackson, Miss: {,
This hour I have had dispatches relii
fron the President ; I can best con- the
vey to you his idea by extiacts fronm
his dispatch : The whole publi,; are
tired out with the autumnal outbreaks
in the South and the great majority one
are now ready to condemui any inter
ference on the part of the government. the,
I heartily wish that peace and good a he
order may be restored without issu- lets
Sing the proclamation mustal be issued, heat
anid if it is, I shall instruct the con- for
nimander ',f the forces to have no child's
pIlavy. If there is necessity for mil- ofn d
- itary' nt ife.nrue there is jtistice in
suCh ioterfetebee to as to deter evil die,
doers,. I r would suggest the eading dru
of $ dispatch or letter by -private dui
message to Governor Ames, urgiig but
hi'm to' strengthen his own positioin by and
exhausting his own resources in rest
orittg.order. Before he ls eeived gov- yon
ermnent aid lie might accept the as- par
Niistance offered by the citizens of coil
Jackson and elsewhere. Gov. Ames whi
and his advisers can be made per- yor
fec~tly secure; as many-of the troops att:
ilow in Mississippi as Lhe deems ue- car
cessary may be sent to Jackson ; if no,
s lihe is betrayed by those who offer as ion
sistance he 'will be in a position to for
defeat their ends and punish them."
SY o. see by this the mind of the Pres
ident, with which I and every meom
Sbtr of the Cabinet who has been con- tio
stilted are in full accord ; you see the tiec
difficulties ; you see the responsibili- An
ties which you assume ; we cannot siln
understand why you don't strengthen An
yourself in tile way tile President titi
suggests, nor do we see why you do pri
not call the Legislature together and vi
obtain fruom them whatever money hll
iand aras you need. The Counstitll- ,jl
t tution is explicit that the executive of ed
the State can call upon the Presidetnt iry
Sfair aid ill suppressing domestic viol- tis
ence only when tile Legislature can- wa
not he convened, and the law espe- Sta
cially provides in cases of any insur- sti
rection in any State against the gov- ini
ernnelnt theleof, and when the Leg- oil
o islature cannot be called together. sh
You make ino sulggestion eren that of
Sthere is aniy insurrection agaiist the he
government of tile State or that the G4
1 I egislature wouhl nlot support yoe in
any nirasnre you imiglh piop,'Ois to
. selve the ,public order. I suggest
y that ylu .take all lawful mneans anld
all teeded measues to preserve tlhe o
peace by' the forces in your own State
anlld let the eoiltntty ~eeltht thie citi
sams cb'liaMisstippi, who are largely e
favorabte to good order, and who are li
Sliargely Rellublican, lhave the courage
anet li nianhiicd to fight oir their rights
n- anid to destroy tle blody rutians
id who mlurder thle innocenit and unof
i- fending freedmen. Everyllthing is i al
readine~s. Be careful to briig your
self strictly t1 thlin the Constitution
.e and the law5i andif there is such re
ill sistance to your State authorities as
you cannot by 'nill the meanls at your
he command suplpress, the President will
h swiftly aid you iu crushing those law
less traitors to humian rights. Telh
gaphi me oln recetlpt of tils and state
to- explicitly what you need.

Worms in IIogs.-T-'lhe; most eml
cient means of combatiug worms is
the use of drastic lurigatives, whicLh,
hiewever, to be successful, require
caution in their admnitiitration. Conm
nlmon salt mnixed in their food will, in
some installces, speedily exercise the
worms; should it not do so, turpen
tine may be given, which will eradi
rento them. It must not be supposed
from the faict that no worms are seen
to come a wat y from the hlg, that -the
medicine is not doing its Iproper office,
as many of the worms die in the in
testines, and go through the same
process of digestion as the food.
