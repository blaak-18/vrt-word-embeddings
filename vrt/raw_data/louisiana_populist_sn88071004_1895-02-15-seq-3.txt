We have had about 10 days of
the coldest weather this country
has seen in years. Thursday morn
ing presented quite a carpet of
snow. The thermometer dropped
to within 4 degrees of zero on
Thursday a week ago, and since
that time the ground has not been
thawed nor the ice all melted. We
hope this may wind up our winter
and that old Sol will get a little
I more partial to us.
We are gladto see Mr. E. J.
Gamble on the streets again, after
his slight illness of last week.
We hear of numerous cases of
sickness this week, mostly of some
form of cold.
The Police Jury met last Satur
day and again Monday. The com
mittee of expert mechanics and
brick-masons appointed by them to
examine into the condition of the
courthouse, reported :condemning
the prosent structure as unsafe for
service and unfit for repairs.
This will doubtless necesitate
the building of a new court house
in this parish.
Sam Jones says: "For two
years the eyes of the people have
been turned towards Congress, but
the omngresmof the United States
has demonstrated that it cannot
psm anything-most of them can't

Recorder.
The great whiskey trust has
