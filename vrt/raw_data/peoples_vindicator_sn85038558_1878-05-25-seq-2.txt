SATURDAY, - - - MAY 25, 1878.
The Investigation.
It is certainly a subject of congra
talation, that the Democratic party
has "summed up nerve" sufficient to
enter into a vigorous investigation of
the frands, which all know to have
been perpetrated, whereby Hayes was
enaugarated as President and the
rightful choice of the people deprivedI
of that office.
The purpose of this investigation,
as the mere fact that it had been or
dered, meets, as it should, the ap
plause of all honorable and right
thinking men. That the frauds
were committed, shameful outrageous
frauds at that, no one, in this section
at least, and conversant with the his
tory of the times, will deny; and that
Hayes was not either directly or in
directly connected with, and had not
a knowledge of them, is an assertion
so bald that people here would re
gard the man who attempted to sus
tain the hypothesis as either idiotic
or insane.
There is an element in politics, and
they are not of to-day or yesterday
bat have dragged on all honorable
people*and parties from the earliest
history, which would have us resort
to future expedients, in dealing with
such monstrous questions as these,
and abandon past experience. Such
an element can only be actuated in
this instance, asit has always been,
by personal motives.
The settlement of the presidential
embrolio of 1876 was, to our mind,
quite easy. All that was necessary
was a strict obedience to the Constitu
tion. What strikes us as the most
senseless of drivel is this call from
some people for "law which will pre
vent the recurrence of such frauds as
enaugarated Hayes," at the expense,
we beg to add, of the very genius of
liberty and lawe. The very law which
these revolutionists overran was
clothed with as much form, both in
verbage and sanctity, as any we
could now enact. If they had no res
pect for the present plain law, is it to
be sapposed these people would have
reverence for any law I The propo
dton is simply preposterouse.
The remedy was lost sight of, or
if apparent, as we believe it was, it
was shirked in a most cowardly man
ner. It was not law that would have
resisted the onslaught of traitors, it
was force ! and its application was not
had simply because our leaders were
eravens. "Constitutions," Macauley
tells as, "exist in vain for those who
have not the will to maintain them,"
and the attempted subversion of the
liberty of the people through the
forms of law began with Antiplhon
and his government of four hundred
and had not ceased with the American
Congress in 1876.
The Democracy of principle, is,
however, asserting itself, and our pat
ty proposes, at whatsoever cost, to
not only prove these frauds, by which
the ballot, that sacred prerogative of
a freeborn oletien was eubverted, but
to panish the perpetrators.
Let the Committee search to the
bottom, no matter who it hurt.
Oar New Orleans Letter.
We present oar readers this week
with the first of a series of letters,
which will appear hereafter, from our
Capital City. They are from the pen
of a patriot and we feel asaered they
will be attentively read by all.
Charley Howard opens his fight on
the defender of the PEOPLE, the New
Orleans Democrat; let the PEOPLE
"move on" to Charley Howard. If
war is what he wants he shallhave it
even it we have to resort to fbrce.
He sboald tremble in the presence of
the majesty of the Commonwealth.
Let as bear from tie Conservative
press now. Their gab was voluble
when denoun'ing the right of any man
to crtitcise the Sapreme Court or the
Legisl.ture.' Howard's Lottery at
taeks the people through the Xew Or
l*ams DeuAlrea, sad it behooves them
to speak out.
Howard said in New Orleans: "The
fetarle Club black-balled me, I made
a grave yard of its rae. course; I
told the Variety Club if they refused
to admit me, I wepd aske a houw
of prostitation of their Theatre; the
Dmasorat has dared attaok me, and

that the tap road is his salvation.
We wanted to give the New Or
loase Pacifc Railroad wo husdred
beusnd dodllrs to bring thil road
toas. We can get a beer thil, the
?AP, for less than one-fowrth thaft ass.
Our business meen most do som

Our Tap Road.,
The VINDICATOR has, we are pleas
ed to note, succeeded in arousing suf
ficient interest in the proposed tap
road to indicate an almost certain
success for the enterprise. Leading
property owners are favorably in
clined to our views, and the more
they give thought to it the more are
they satisiedl of the manybenuefits to
accrue to our city therefrom.
We have been living for a long
time in the delusive fancy that we
had a "Western trade"; that fancy
was inherited, from the fact that in
by-gone ages Mexico traded with the
United States through our town. We
have had our eyes turned to the West,
the uplands of Sabine and Natchito
ches, when behind us lay the rich
alluvials of the Red and Cane rivers;
the prorductive hammock lands of
Eastern Hill territory, contiguous to
us, and, when the tap is coustructed,
dependent upon us for an outlet to
the world by rail.
What we expect to accomplish is
the protection of our city as it stands
from desertion; its property from
further depreciation. The means by
which that can be achieved is the
building of this tap. Nay. When
that is done our present business, in
trade, rent and property will at once
be doubled. Then we can exert our
selves to fill the country with honest,
industrious land thrifty settlers who
will develope our agricultural wealth
and build up that trade to which we
are entitled and to which we can as
pire-a heavy local business.
A meeting of the citizens of this
city is in contemplation for an early
day, of which due notice will be giv
en, and we trust that every one will
attend, for the simple reason, that we
have a community of interest in the
subject for consideration which all
should share and advocate.
Convention in August,
We have but little over sixty days
in which to canvass and select dele
gates to the State Convention to as
semble at Baton Rouge. We have
no fears but that a proper set of rep
resentative gentlemen will be ac
credited to that body. The nomina
tion of a suitable candidate for State
Treasurer is a matter of very little
difficulty, and but secondary to the
real questions there to be decided.
We consider that the main 'issue
will be the future policy of the party.
In former years, while our success as
a party was a matter of doubt, it was
thought best to issue platforms fall of
glittering platitudes, having it espe
Ecially understood that a newConstitn
tion was the aim of the party; for
nothing in the way of relief, it was
well understood, could come, save
through a change in the organic law.
"Understandings" have been found
inadeqnate to the purpose, and our
people now insist upon specije utter
ances. The vague idea of "defeating
the enemy" is demagogical. Thae "ene
my" is a mythical term, whom a large
tnumber of good citizens begin to be
lieve can exist within our ranks as
well as elsewhere. Be that as it may,
they are satisfied that the defeat of
that "person" is better assured by a
square issue than by a frothy platform
oil of nothing.
'1'lhe new Constitution men in the
coming Cdkventron will be in the
large majority, and from 'them we
confidently hope for an enanciation
of principles in accotd with the pop
ular heart; with the true Democratic
ring, and upon which the "enemy"
will be successfully and fnally routed.
The Thibodeaur Sentinel is most
lamentably mistaken when it aeserte
we solicited itto follow our lead in
democracy. That, we consider a
hopeless task. Its column answer
of ngiserable stuff is a waste of raw
wasterial. What we said was said to
resent the impertinence of the Senti
el in presuming to' blackguard other
and better newspapers than it, be
ean se those papers exercised their
right to criticise the Supreme Court,
the 'Execative and the Legislature.
With this explanation we dismiss the
Sentinel and its'drivel as on worthy of
notice.

A Sad Notice.
The partner of our friend L. Caspari
Esq., and an acquaintance of many
of oar citisens, to whom he had en
dersetl himself by noble qualities,
Mr Michael Dietrich, died in New Or
leans on the 4th instant, of Consump
tioe. Mr Districh was a good citizen,
a charitable and consciencions gentle
Â£mPa, aud iis death is deplored by his
many friends and acquaintances.

Prostitution of JIstle#'.
The citizens it this !itwe Liv'
earned a reputation for l,61.r1 eaironce,
after having submitted to torials whichI
would scarcely 1w creditedl did we
but enumerate them, hlt we think
our long suffering people were lar)s
ed in indignation to the highest pitch
when the deputy Sheriff, William
Boullt, removed but a few degrees in
character from an ordinary criminal
himself, flaunted in their faces the
notorious Henry C. Myers on the
public streets, Tuesday last.
A negro, for pilfering a henroost or
stealing a hog, would be, for the of
fence, simply lodged in a dark cell in
our parish prison; but a scoundrel,
whose crime, in enormity, cannot be
summed in language; who robbed
our children of the means with which
we proposed to elevate them above
the brute; who struck a blow at our
civilization by plundering our School
Treasury, and who has been for over
three years a fugitive felon, is allow
ed an escort through the public
streets to insult manhood and deceno
cy by his sight and presence.
We think our people have suffered
a ensufficiency of this degradation, and
the impudence of William Boullt
should not go unr.buked. Let Myers
be put from the sight of honest men.
If he will walk, and his captor friends
like perambulating in his company,
let it be done in the purlieus of the
town where the prositutes can gaze
on well dressed male images of their
kind. We protest, in the name of
decency and virtue, against a further
sight of these monsters.
Republicanism.
If any thing was wanted to prove
that Republicanism is the naked foe
of the peace of this country-that, if
it ever had a "mission," that mission
was long since accomplished, that
want is supplied by the following
plank from the Pennsylvania Repub
Slican platform, recently adopted at
their convention at IbHrrisburg :
That we are now, as ever, opposed
to the payment of claims froum
the national treasury to those lately
engaged in or symrpathizing with the
rebellion. No conquerer should be
forced to pay indemnity to the con
quered, and the presentations of bills
demanding over $300,000,000 at the
present session of a Democratic house
Sis a warning to the country of the
cost and danger of retaining in pow
er a party whose chief aim is to make
reprisals on the taxpayers for losses
which the crime of treason brought
Supon the Southern people.
tThe South is here willfully charged
f with an -attempt to "raid the treas
ury,"' in the payment of "indemnity
to the conquered," when such a
rcharge is a known falsehood. This
wicked attempt to alarm the caution
and economy of the North, is the last
shred upon which the Republican par
ty hopes to contest for political power.
What are the facts of this charge ?
Mr. Money, of Mississippi, in aspeech
of recent date, shows this "claim
bnsiness'l in its true light, and his
masterly effort completely routs the
radical howlers.
He shows that these economists
constitute themselves the guardians
I of the public tleasdry from every
quarter save their own.
The total amount of money expend
ed by the Government, from the adop
tion of the Federal Constitution
down to 30th June, 1873, to the
Northern States, has been $227,886,
202 17. To the South $71,841,581 76.
And in land, for the North, 176,000,
000 acres, to the South, 17,000,000
aerce. Nor is this vast sum of money
and area of laud sufficient to satisfy
the craving demands of these guard
lans! The North clamors at the
treasury doors now for one billion lire
hundred milion* and twenty-two thou
sandethirtlyfve dollars and thirty cents.
Before this stupendous sum, which
bewilders the mind, the mite of $300,
000,000 sinks into insignificance.; and
still they tell us that the South, the
treasonable South, i8 bent on wreck
ing the treasury.
Out upon sach a party; reduced to
the miserable extremity of open faced
lying for at issue upon which to~pp
peal for support. With a Presiaent
in the chair plundered from the peo
ple-a steal and a frand; with its
Congressmeh whooping-on to the
strong box of the government vocif
erously clabiog a billign and one half
of money, it has the shameless cheek
to charge the South with an attempt
at robbery.
Such a party deserves, as it will re
ceive, the condemnation of American
honor and manhood everywhere. It
has lived its days of blood, of outra-'
ges, of violence and caluny, and
will go down,to its grave justly em
balmed in infamy.
Alex. Stephens, of Georgis, says he
could not in honor vote on the Pot
ter resolution, to investigate Hayes
title, because lie was paired, but had
he not been lie would have voted
against it. Stephens never yet stood
in the face of a equare issae but what
he limped like a dish-rag. Ben Hill
pronounced Stephens the master dem
agogue of the age, and as for little
ness Stephens is without a parallel,
both as regards his ph)sical appear
ance and his purposes.
An Indianapolis lawyer has invented
an opera-glass which enables the holder
to see the audience to the right or left
withont turning his head. The inven
tor is now at work on a gun that will

New York World, takes to task the
Smn for its vindictiveness, and de
fieuds the South from the mlalieinns
assaunlts of its neioghbor, tlhat '"shines
for all."
The San rwas the loudest-mouthed
yeller for ''peace at any price,"' of all
the dough-faced papers of the North.
Not a Southertn an1 or jourinal dared
whimper submission, anti when
Messrs. lill :and Lamar' talked of
yielding, they were denonced from
one end of the South to the other.
In our next issue we will produce
an article frotn the pen of MIaj. Hear
scy, of the New Orleans Democrat,
which our readers will say is a fitting
answer to the San's diatribe.
A LIBEL SUIT
For Twenly-Five Thousand Dollars.
(New Orleans Times.)
Messrs. Horner and Senmnes, attorneys,
have filed a suit. fr_ the Lottery Conm
pany against Albert C. Janin, in the
fourth district court, for libel for the
sumn of twenty-tive thousand dollars.
The petitioner sets forth that Mr.
Janin is one of the editors and pIroprie
tors of the Democrat, alnd that on the
15th of this month he wickedly, mali.
ciously, and intending to injure petition
er, and in order to cause the imputtations
therein to be believed, lie published in
the New Orleans I)Democrat a false and
malicious libel headed "An Outrage."
The petititioners aver that Chas. T.
Howard is its nmanager, and that the
words "Howard and his brother thieves'
were intendedtl to be taken and were ta
ken by the public to mean that Janiin
denounced your petitioner and his eut
ployees nndler control ot' said manager
and otherwise, and the dlirectors and
stockholders as thieves, dishonest per
sois, felons who should be putnished by
the piower of' the law and that the bu
siness of petitiontter was dlishonestly cou
ducted by persons of dishonest character;
that the words "Howard's swindling
concern" were intended to be taken and
were takent to mean the Lottery Compa
ny, and to denounce it a cheat, a fraud,
an imposition and a deception ;, that the
words "Howard and his pals treated to a
short shift andi a long rope" were to be
taken and were taken to mean that pe
titioners manager, employees, directors
and stockholders were thieves, and the
companies and confederates ofthieves all
of which is wholly false, untrue. un
founded and wickedly written n'id pub
lished, and has greatly damtaged peti
tioner's business, its character, its good
name and standing, and in the deprecia
tion of its stock.
Petitioner fuirther shows that by the
words of said libel as follows : "We shall
not be surprised t see ssome fine morning,
the Lottery Company's imposing palace
of vice torn down by a band of resolute
citizens, and Howard and his pals treated
to a short shift and long rope," said
Janin intended to, and did mean by the
words "palace of vice," that petitioners
place of business was conducted in a dis
honest manner and to perpetrate a ma
tlicious desire to incite a mob to injure
and destroy the property of your peti
tioner, and to kill petitioner's eniployees,
directors and stockholders, and to hold
them and petitioner up to public repro
bation withont any cause and with
malice and the evil intention to injnre
petitioner, and petioner has hereby ans
tained, Rgst damage.
The petition closes with the usual pray
er and five interrogatories embodying in
questions to Mr. Janin the allegatione
given above.
So 1Mr. Howard proposes to libel
the only decent paper in New Orleans;
the outspoken, fearless friend of the
people is to be silenced by this infa
mous, legalized, gambling swindle.
We are rejoiced that this monster
should come from its works and as
sail decent people, because such ac
tion will rally the masses t9 its des
truction. Now, we will see just how
much honesty there is in the protes
sions of so-called Democrats, who for
years howled about Radical outrages,
Radical villainies, and afterward,
when in office themselves, proceeded
to execute laws which every man of
common sense in the Commonwealth
knows to be unconstitutional.
Let every honorable man; every
decent paper in Louisiana, rally to
the support of the fearless Democrat;
its cause is their cause; the very es
sence of our liberty, the right of Ha'
beas Corpus and trial by jury, hangs
in the scale
They Will Not.
LN. Y. un.]
The Methodiste of the South. are
holding their eight General Confer
ence in Atlanta, and many represent
aLive clergymen and laymen are there.
The Conference should not adjourn
without giving voice to the abhor
rence with which all honorable mnem
'bers of the Methodist, as of every
other church, regard the Great Frad
by which the people of the United
States have been robbed of their
choice for the Presidenoy, 'Â·
We feel fully assured that our
Methodist friends of the South will do
no such thing as that suggested by
the Sun. They and we know Hayes
to be a fraud ; and his party are, to
our and their knowledge, the open
enemies of Southern peace, honor and
prosperity, but our religiouns bodies
have never yet entered,.nor never will
enter, the political arena, as has been
done in the North. The Methodist
whites of the South, as men and citi
zens, will aid all honorable men, in
this and the Northern section of the
Union,..in brnging Mr. Hayes and
his co-addjutors in crime to the block,
but to drag their church as a church
into the fray, we believe they will
never do it.
Died.

May 12th, MR. JOHN LITrLE, aged 66
years.
Mr Lidtle was an old citizen of this
place, where he has many friends and
aequaiutences *ho will be pained to
