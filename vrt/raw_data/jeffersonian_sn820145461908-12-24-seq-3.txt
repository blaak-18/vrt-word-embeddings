OME folks has awful hard
hearts!” The girl ’ s
breath drew in with a lit
tle sobbing catch as she
knelt on the wide hearth
stone to mend the fire.
“Es anybody would a-told
me a-yesterday that pappy
and his new wife —and
her old sisters —would drive off in our
wagon to the Eversole’s for the
Christmas dance and leave me here
by my lonesome, I wouldn’t never
have believed ’em —not one word.”
'She was talking to herself to fight
the solitude of the rapidly darkening
December afternoon. Her slim little
figure against the broken leap and
shine of the great fire she had now
brought into being suggested some
old artist’s Cinderella. The big-pu
piled, long-lashed gray eyes still
swam with tears that blurred the
brightness of the dancing flames. She
put up the back of her hand to push
the tangle of dark curls off of her
forehead. She was only sixteen, and
a dance counts for so much when you
are sixteen, a mountain girl, hard
worked, and recently presented with
a youthful stepmother.
When gentle old Gideon Kimbrew
brought home Argentina Shuttles, a
bride, to his cabin, she had already
announced to all of her kith and kin
that she intended to see that Lissy
did her share of the work and learned
to be of some account.
“Allers with her eyes on the stars
and her feet trippin’ up against a
tree root —she’ll come to no good end
es she ain’t took hold of right now
and put through good and hard,” the
lady of the silvery name informed
her new-made husband.
A bridegroom, particularly one
who had been a widower and was ten
years older than his bride, could do
no less than fall in with her plans,
even when these included the bring
ing of her two sisters, Beulah and
Vashti, to the cabin, and giving them
a rest from the heavy work at home,
while slight little Lissy found her
burdens almost intolerably increased.
But she hadn’t minded so very much;
the slip of a girl with the dreamy
gray eyes had her own reasons for
content. She waited on the new
stepmother, and the new stepmoth
er’s kin, and accepted with exasper
ating amiability all reproofs and
strictures upon herself, her appear
ance and behavior. The first utter
ance of rebellion had come this after
noon when Icy May Shuttles was
brought over from the Far Cove, and
Lissy was informed that there would
not be room in the wagon for her to
go to the Eversole dance.
“Hit’ll do you no harm to stay
home and finish up cyardin’ that wool
you th’owed down the other day,” her
stepmother told her. “An’ Icy May,
she certainly has obliged to git over
to the Eversoles, because her and
Hartley Eversole is all but engaged.
I know in reason that what brung
him back from Texas is to ask paw
for Icy May, and I make no doubts
that they’ll be wedded come New
Lissy Kimbrell's Christmas
By Alice MacGolvan
Year’s, and he’ll take her back to live
on that there ranch he’s been a tell
in’ us all about. Es I do say it as
hadn’t ort, Icy May’s got the looks
and the manners for a rich man’s
wife. Don’t you want to lend her
that there breastpin—seein’ you
can’t go—and help her to do up her
hair, like you do your’n?”
Lissy remembered with a kind of
sick revolt the misery of doing up
Icy May’s rough, straight sorrel mop
to imitate the manner in which she
always knotted her dusky curls in
place. She had informed her step
mother that she couldn’t see the
breatspin on her bureau. It was true
that she could not, for the cherished
trinket lay inside the buttoning of
her bodice and trembled with the
guilty beating of her heart as she
spoke. 'She held the shining thing
now in her hand and turned it in the
light of the fire, a cheap little rolled
plate brooch, with a setting of blue
china to imitate a turquoise, circled
about with some bits of glass.
“Hartley gave it to me last Christ
mas,” she repeated to herself like a
child trying to find comfort in the
happy past. “He said —he said that
this Christmas —” She broke off
and wiped away the moisture that
would gather on the long lashes. “But
I wasn’t going to let that old Icy
May wear it, even if I had to tell a
story to keep it from her. Oh, I be
lieve it’s goin’ to snow! Now if
snow falls right deep, I can’t git out
even to preachin’, and Hartley he’ll
go back to Texas, and I’ll never see
him —and—oh— ’ ’
She had sprung up to look from
the one window of the room toward
a few white flakes that fluttered past
the panes. Now she sank back be
fore the fire shaken by a grief al
most too acute for tears. But there
are griefs so intolerable that they
cannot be indulged; Lissy got once
more to her feet with the necessity
for action strong upon her. Before
her mind swam the picture of her
father and his new wife sitting on
the front seat of the wagon, the three
big, raw-boned, hard-favored Shut
tles girls in chairs behind them, driv
ing away; even Speaker, the old
hound, followed them, deserting her.
“I’ve got to do something,” she
murmured to herself. “I’m a-goin’
to put on my frock just like I expect
ed to go to the dance, and I’ll curl
my hair the way Hartley said he
liked it. I’m mighty glad I hid out
that thar blue ribbon—paw’s wife
surely would have took it away from
me and give it to Icy May tonight.”
Thus reflecting she lit a candle and
crept to the small, frozen loft room
where stood her trunk. From this
she brought out a soft blue wool de
laine dress. Her stepmother had
said that it would spot and fade.
Lissy smiled softly to herself all
alone as she handled the blue folds;
Argentina Shuttles didn’t know
whose favorite color blue was; Ar
gentina had no idea who it was that
had said her eyes just matched the
color of such blue as this. Then
3effer*onlaß
those eyes were suddenly so full of
tears that the girl could scarcely see
the blue dress, and the candle be
came only a luminous haze. Hartley
was dancing right now with Icy May,
and she, Lissy, would never see him
again, never —never —never. She put
down her head on the edge of the
trunk and wept unrestrainedly for a
few moments, then gathered her pos
sessions over her arm and went down
the stairs.
That dressing alone in the cabin
for a dance she was never to attend
was made a serious business of, and
before it was completed the action
had strangely comforted the girl. Her
cheeks were flushed; above them her
eyes shone like stars; her foot was
light as she went to and fro at her
preparations. The blue dress became
her more than any she had ever worn,
for she had never put one on in such
a strange mood of exalted expecta
tion. The blue ribbon bound her
dark curls to just the perfect coif
fure she desired.
And when all was done she looked
about her, trying hard to get more
than a glimpse of herself in the bit
of looking-glass she had taken from
the wall and carried to the better
light of the broad hearth; and the
chill of bleak fact fell suddenly upon
her glowing mood. She was dressed
—for what 1 ? She expected—whom?
Soberly she hung the little mirror
back in place and went once more to
the hearthstone, pushing a brand in
with the toe of her shoe. Enough
snow had fallen to carpet the ground
outside and cover upstanding objects
with a thin veil of white; a few
flakes yet whirled in the air. She
knew all this without looking from
her window. Suddenly some one
passed that window and a muffled
step sounded on the porch. Some
body rapped at the door. Lissy was
alone; it was night; yet in that
primitive community she had no
thought of fear. She flew to the
door and swung it wide. In its
square of modified darkness, back
grounded by the shimmering land
scape outside, stood a tall man, snow
on the shoulders of his overcoat,
snow on the brim of his hat, which he
removed and stood turning slowly in
his hands.
“Hart!” she cried. And then in a
curious, half-frightened voice. “Why,
Hartley Eversole —why ain’t you to
the dance, over at you-all’s house?”
“I —I was just a-goin’ a-past,” the
tall young fellow began hesitatingly,
“and I seen yo’ light in the winder.
Yo’ stepmother ’lowed—she kinder
give me to understand you was —that
you wouldn’t be at home this evenin’,
but—well, I was just cornin’ a-past,”
he returned to his old formula.
Both young people became aware
at the same instant that Lissy had
failed to ask him in. He turned as if
to go. “I left my horse under the
shed,” he said finally. “I see you
are fixin’ to go somewhars, and I
reckon I better be movin’ along my
self. Fact is, I did come to ask

Financial Depressions
Periodical financial depressions distress
the country. We call them inevitable; are
they? Is there no cure? Is not the debtor
—many simply in panic to pay the creditor
—few?
The Remedy
is given in “Usury; from a Scriptural, Eth
ical and Economic Standpoint,” In which
great book, for the first time in years, logic,
religion, theory and practice are so united
as to demonstrate convincingly that
Usury
is the cause of our recent and every finan
cial distress. The author, Rev. J. C. Elli
ott, strikes heavy blows on present systems.
