AN APPEAL
To the Populists of the
United States.
We are to be congratulated upon
the growth of our party and the
fact that in the recent election
nearly half the voters of the Union
indorsed much of our platform.
No party ever achieved more bril
liant success in so brief a time.
Although handicapped in late
late campaign, we emerge
from the contest stronger than
ever, Our party alone has a
voting force larger than that which
elected Lincoln and an able, effec
tice reform press of nearly two
thousand papers. We elected
several governors as well as hun
dreds of other State, county, and
town officials. We hold the bal
'ance of power in the United States
Senate and have four times as
many congressmen as ever before.
We united with the silver for
ces in the recent campaign,-not
because we believe free coinage of
silver is the solution of the finan
cial problem, but because it would
better existing conditions, would
meet with the least resistance and
become the entering wedge of our
main issue, viz., full legal tender
paper money, issued and regula
ted by the government alone.
Having proved our loyalty at the
polls, we are free to act separate
ly on advanced lines and to em
phasize the real issues our party
was born to advocate. We cannot
in honor lay down our arms and
cease our activity until the war
for which we enlisted has ended
in victory for our cause.
The democratic party proposes
to contine the silver fight. Tw~o
parties canno, exist on the same
issue. The greater absorbs the
smaller. Therefore, if we remain
mere camp followers of another
party, disint ration will result.
ur party success alone forced the
democrats to adopt the Chicago
platform andt nominate a popocrat
for President. Con verts made by
party regularity cin not be trusted
with the reforms of the future.
DEMOCRATS ~TBIED TO ABSORB POP
ULISTS.
While ~hairman of the Chicago
branch of our executive committee
during the campaign, my contact
with the chairman of the demo
cratic State committees revealed
to me the fact that in many cases
the were more anxious to elect
their State tickets and absorb the
populists than they were for the
success of Bryan and the Chicago
platform, but this does not apply
to the chairman and officers of the
National Committe.
We are not democrats and can
not be classed as such. We simp
ly united for a sangle campaign.
The democratic party is but the
roar guard of our own. We do
not stand for redemption money,
but for a scientifi9 dollar, kept
invariable by proper regulation of
the money volume. Then why
bshould a high school graduate
re-enter the intermedsate grade?
Our grandest achievements are in
the future, if we inspire the peo
plie through. separate party action
with our chief issues, and hold
our forces together by taking the
lead winch belongs to us in press
ing to suecees the relorms of the
millionsof onvers to sil
ver during. the recent campaign
lnuatadvanoQ. They will not re
main where they are. We must
ledute them upto the main issue,
the time todo it is now, not
itbefore a Presidential election.
wenimnat alsoi hold the democratic
Sto its presentiposition or
1 t nto avance,
SEPARATE PARTY ACTION PROPOSED.
History teaches that to achieve
conservative results, a radical po
sition must be taken, The sub
stitution of our main plank for a
subordinate one, as the fighting is
sue of the next four years, is in
line with the best sentiment of our
party and requires no change of
front, no abandonment of princi
ple, no new platform. The main
army mnerely moves up to occupy
the position held by the skirmish
line.
President Cleveland supplies us
with fresh incentive for renewed
effort, in his official demand for
the retirement of the greenbacks
and the issue and control of Iapelr
money (except coin certificates) by
the banks. Senator Quay says
this should be made an issue by
the republicans, and advocates the
substitution of United States notes,
payable in gold, for the green
backs.
Here we have a living issue
with both wings of the gold for
ces, which brings our main question
to the front--Shall the paper
money of the country be issued
and regulated by the people or by
the banks This will precipitate
a hot debate in Congress that will
focus public attention upon the
relative merits of scientific and re
demption money, which will be
come the absorbing question of the
day, just as the silver movement
followed the silver debate a year
ago, and will afford our sentinels
in congress gn opportunity to
measure the true attitude of the
silver, democratic and republican
leaders, on an issue vital to our
party and the welfare of the coun
try, and to determine to what ex
tent our recent allies can be de
pended upon.
Again, the fact that the rail
road, telegraph, and telephone
companies became the wiilling tools
of a campaign committee in the
recent election furnishes us with
another striking argument for the
government ownership of these
great monopolies. We are not a
free people so long as they can be
utilized for campaign purposes in
the interest of trusts and combines.
The proposed retirement of the
greenbacks and the discussion of
the Pacific Railroad question will
bring before Congress the two
strongest measures of our plat
form; and whatever issue the oth
er parties may adopt, the logic of
events will so force upon both
Congress and the people the con
sideration of these measures as to
overshadow all others, and win to
our ranks thousands of voters
from both the republican and dem
ocratic parties.
LIVING ISSUES FOR THE PEOPLE.
These are living issues upon
which we shall grow. 'T'he argent
necessity for them will appeal to
the people, grouning under the
weight of "McKinley prosperity,"
"restored confidence," and the en
forced idleness and extreme pover
ty attending them. They appeal
with equal force to the business
man, coerced by the banks; to the
wage earner, the helpless victim of
corporations; and to the farmer,
cursed with mortgages and extor
tionate freight rates. They ar&
issues free from the charge of
mercenary motives, to enrich a
portion of our constituency.
Let us act with patriotism, cour
age, and sagacity. Let us lose no
time. If any lack incentive, it
will be found in the intense suffer
ing and in the increasing arrogance,
lawlessness, and heartlessness or
the trusts and monopolies. Against
their power we put principle;
against their money we match man
hood, and urge all populists to
continue this contest during the
next four years and then hold an
early national convention, to strike
the keynote of the next Presiden
tial campaign, or, if desirable, es
tablish an honorable alliance on
leading issues.
I also suggest that a nationl con
ference of party leaders and work
ers be held as soon as. practicable,
that we may have a full and free
expression of opinion regarding
our future work. We hope, there
for, that the reform press will give
the fullest possible expression of
their views on this important sub
ject; and our friends are invited
to write me or our national chair
man, expressing their ideas on the
independent party action herein
proposed.
Shall we march to victory un
der our own banner, or continue
as stragglers under another ?
