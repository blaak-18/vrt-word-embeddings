WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT.
WVe hear a good deal :hout what the
people want and demand ii regard to
primaries and elective ~fice holders. If
the people really want and demand stcht
reforms. and want them had enough,
there is no way to prevent them from
securing them. The people can and will
get what they want in a government likes
ours when they have the ccurage of
their convictions. Politicians dare not
stand in the way of public sentiment
when it is aroused and ready to assert
and enforce its power. If the people of
Louisiana really want nominations by
primaries and all officers made elective
by a popular vote, they will have it so
or know the reason why. We believe
the people want these reforms, but we
shall seec-Homer Guardian.
The people know what they want, but
being law-ablding, conservative and pa
tient, are slow in manifesting their dis
pleasure beyond complaint or silent pro
tests. When the people will, they will,
and from all indications they are awak
ening: rubbing their eyes' and thinking.
When they get on their feet and begin
to move, silently, earnestly, determined
ly, they will secure what they want and
should have. In the meantime the press
of the State, the press that would help
the people in the awakening, will con
tinue to direct and point the way to
emancipation, to political freedom.
GORMAN AND FOSTER
Senator Murphy J. Foster of Louis
iana was ambitious to become a member
of the Senate steering committee; but
Gorman had the naming of the commit
tee, and he passed the Louisiana senator
by. Murphy J. is a great politician in
Louisiana and usually has things his
own way, but when he goes up against
Arthur Pue Gorman he meets a man
who knows a thing or two about the
festive game of politics himself, and he
may expect to lose out, at least, occa
sionally.-lnomer Guardian.
Yes, that't all right, but nex' time Mr.
Gorman he will know something whqn

\Vashington's new senator. Ankenny.
is president of six different national
banks and the richest capitalist in the
State. He is therefore supposed to be
qualified for membership in the national
"millionaires' club."-Bossier Banner.
And when he will have been listed as
one of the club he, with his associates,
will object to the selection of United
States senators by the common people.
The common herd must begin at the
legislatures if they would "reform" the
club.
THE FLOOD OF 1849.
Mr. Enny Wells of Bayou Robert,
one of the oldest native born citizens of
the parish, called today to renew his
subscription. He remembers perfectly
the immense flood of 1849 in the Red
river valley. He says that in 1849'all of
Alexandria was overflowed except a
few spots here and there. The' land
above Alexandria, known as the
"sland," all the way from here to Boyce,
was overflowed with but few exceptions.
The water ran over the island into
Bayou Boeuf, and through Bayou Rob
ert. At that time there was a ferry on
Bayou Rapides where Bayou Robert
united with Bayou Rapides. During the
overflow of 1849 the water was almost
a solid sheet frmo the pine hills on the
north side of the river to the pine hills
on the south side, ten miles or more
wide. The levees in 1849 did not amount
to much.-Alexandria Town Talk.
In 1849 when "levees" was mentioned
it was' more in the line of raising "the
pot" than of.restraining the flood of the
river. An old 49'er once said within the
bearing of the Caucasian Grinder :
`'Well, sir, in '49 there was a flood which
was aflood. It beat Noah's'forty days
rain. Shreveport 'was then a smaller
place than it is now-(this conversation
is recalled as a reminiscence of the flood
of - ). "Well, sir, talk abo rain
axIl water and more water than whiskey1
and ,il this nonsense! Well, sir; .there
was so much water in the country, at
the time, that a man drunk as g-'bile
owl' would sober up as straight as a
judge at the sight of old Red booming
down to the Gulf. Everything was wa
ter; even whiskty straight had a water
taste about it, and to give tone to his
whiskey even a man. of temperate hab
its had to mix in a little red hot Cay
entte pepper 'with it. Several generally
sober-sided tried to 'full up' and, raise
the town but-. It was not possible
for a man to keep up a 'jamboree' on
account of the water. The water cov
ered every inqh of land from the hills
in Bossier and Arkansas to the hills in
'Texas and Caddo parish. Where is now
Thick lake and Silver lalie and Market
street steamboats and alligators could'
fioat at ease. You may all talk about
water and rain, but there never was
such wzter as 'in '49."
And the man who said all this was
iemingly astonished, somewhat dum
founded, because not a man in the
crowd "ventured to. question a single
.word of Ilis statement. Every 4word he
.spoke,' tspecially his reference tQ the
than being "tanked up" "sobering up"
at the very sight of Red river, were ac
cepted without reservation. The 4g'er is
always all right. It is not the flood of
54p which i worrying the people, nor
the whiskey, but the water of 1903.

A HORRIBLE CRIME
T. J. BULLOCK POISONED BY
HIS WIFE.
Deliberate and Persistent Was Her Pur
pose-An Admission of Guilt
and a Contradiction.
There is in the custody of the sheriff
a woman. Mrs. J. C. Bullock, who is
charged with. the murd.r of her hus
band. T. J. Bullock, a man over fifty
years of age, who died at his home on
Franklin street Saturday afternoon be
tween 3 and 4 o'clock.
The recital of the facts may be abbre
viated from all sensation. It is a pitiful
case-pitiful because the children of this
couple are -the sufferers. and their ages
range frosy the small tot to a splendid,
good feced hard working young man
who has recently reached his maturity
and is married. And there is also a
grown daughter, living in Kansas City,
Mo., and the others are in their teens.
For some time T. J. Bullock has been
sick. Under the tratment of his physi
cians he improved, but relapsed, with
complications. On being questioned, Mrs.
Bullock admitted having given him
croton oil, in small doses, and, ground
glass in capsules. This admission she
cogi aicted afterwards and explained
thatjae eroton oil was administered un
der the advise of a friend, to soothe her
husband in his slumbers. Certainly she
did not know the effect of croton oil.
This woman is either insane or one of
the most devilish of her kind. The scene
which occurred at the home of the fam
ily on Franklin street when the officers
conveyed her 'away baffles description.
Her children, not realizing their situa
tion, cried pitifully. Her son followed
her' to the court house with her young
child, who shuddered with lamentations
at the very thought of his mother being
locked up in the jail. It was a sad sight,
sad indeed. The w Oman realizes her pre
dicament and now and then her par
oxysms indicated tatat she was being
moved by great emotion concealed and
restrained with a$1 the power at her
command.
T. J. Bullock and family came to
Shreveport from Logansport about four,
years ago and at one time kept a board- I
ing house at the Junction.`
D. B. DOYLE.
Warrant for Two Thousand Dollars for
His Insurance.
The reporter of Alpha Lodge No.'
2301, Knights of Honor, received yester
day from Noah M. Givan, supreme re
porter, a warrant for $2900, being in;
favor of Mrs. D. B.-Doyle, whose hus
band, a member of the lodge, died
at his home, in this city on January 29,
1903. The widow having moved to Illi
nois, the warrant was returned, but she
will be paid the amount at her residence
through the Knights of Honor. This is
a quick settlement, but it is In keeping
with the- promptness and the reliability
of this, one of the best fraternal institu
tions, through which thousands of wid
ows and orphans have been relieved and
provided 'for.
WEATHER BULLEMIN.
The Cold, the Warm and the Storm
Waves Forecasted.
(Copyrighted 1903 by W. T. Foster.)
St. Joseph. Mo., March 14.-My last
bulletin gave forecasts - of distiurbance
to cross the continent March io to 14,
warm wave 9 to 13, cool wave 12 to 16.
Next disturbance will reach Pacific
coast about .March rs, cross west of the
Rockies by close of 16, great central
valleys 17 to 19, eastern states 2o.
Warm wave will cross west of the
Rockies about, March 15, great central
valleys 17, eastern states ig. Cool way
will :0'ts west of Rockies about March
's great central valleys 4 eastern
20, moving eastward about coo miles a
day.
Indications are that this cold wave
will not reach so far south as did that
of February i8. Its center seems to he
marked for a route extending from
Manitoba into the Ohio valley and then
eastward. The storm wave will move
so rapidly that warm wave, cold wave
and rains will be of short duration.
Remainder of the month is expected
to average colder than usual with rain
fall above the average.
Another disturbance will reach the
Pacific coast abott 20, cross west of the
Rockies by close of 25, great central
valleys 22 to 24, eastern states 25.
Warm wave will cross west of the
Rockies aubut 20, great central valleys
2?, eastern states 24. Cool wave will
cross of the Rockies about 23, great
central valleys 25, eastern states 27.
The storm wave and cool wave of
this disturbance will be moderate, going
to greatest extremes in southwest.
The city council at a session on Fri
day night, as a committee of the whole,
commended the project for the improve
ment of streets: Crockett from Market
to Texas avenue, Travis from Market
to Common, Edwards from Travis to
Crockett, Marshall from Travis to
Crockett, McNeil from Travis to Crock
ett, Louisiana from Travis to Crockett,
Common from Travis to Crockett, Cot
ton from Louisiana to Texas avenue,
Louisiana avenue from lake to Jordan,
Marshall from Crockett to Second,
Western avenue from Sprague to Hope,
Hope from Western avenue to Texas
avenue, Anna from Western to bridge,
Southern avenue from Jordan to Dash
iell, Jordan from Irving place to Cres
well. Irving place fronT Jordan to Wich
ita. Fairfield from Dashiell to Olive,
Texas road from Cedar to corporation
line, being a total of 4.49 miles. Anw
sewer improvement: Crockett from Ed
wards to Louisiana. Marshall from
Crockett to alley, McNeil from Crock
ett to Milam. The total cost is estimated
at about $256,ooo, to pay which an issu
ance of bonds will be necessary..
The taxpayers, at least a majority,
will no doubt vote for such bonds, since
the improvement of streets is all im
portant an'd necessary.

BATSON GUILTY.
The second trial of A. E. Batson at
Lake Charles has ended in his convic
tion of the murder of the Earl family
near Welsh. On the first trial he was
convicted as charged, but secured a new
trial on technicalities. There were, as
usual throughout the State, the senti
mental class who did not think he was
guilty. At any rate he has been convict
ed and will hang-hang did we say? Oh,
no, ganging legally would break his neck
and cause his death. He will take the
"more severe' penalty of life imprison
ment which he doubtless will secure.
What is needed in Louisiana as mtich as
fair trrls are a few first class legal ex
ecutions. Why not?
