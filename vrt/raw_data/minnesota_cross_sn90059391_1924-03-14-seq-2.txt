“Fanatic Zealots” Is Term Ap
plied to Contestants of Texas
Election, by Lawyer
(Burp.-iu of rublii-ntion mid Education)
WASHINGTON. D. C., March 4
“My attention has been invited to
many statements appearing in the
public press purporting to come from
the attorneys of Mr. Peddy in the
contest touching the right of Sena
tor Mayfield to continue represent
ing the people of Texas in the sen
ate of the United States.” said W. F.
Zumbrunn, attorney for U. S. Sena
tor Earle B. Mayfield, today. Contin
uing about the matter, Attorney
Zumbrunn issued the following state
ments of facts today:
“The attorneys representing Mr
Peddy are accredited with stating
that Mr. Peddy is gaining in the re
recount four to one over Senator May
field; that out of 49 counties in
which the recount has been complet
ed, the entire recount in these coun
ties has been rejected, meaning
thereby that the United States sen
ate or ks investigating committee,
has not only refused to consider but
has rejected all ballots in these
counties; these attorneys .apparently
sanctioned by Mr. Peddy and those
fathering his false policy, would have
the people of Texas believe that all
Mayfield ballots in those counties
had been discarded by the senate of
the United States; these statements
are as false as the cause being cham
pioned by these men.
“In the 49 counties in which the
recount has been completed, there
are five counties where the ballots
have been entirely destroyed, hence,
the official election certificates is
sued by the Texas officials will be
controlled when the senate is called
upon to act.
“In 11 counties out of the 49, from
two to five precincts in each county
are missing following as a natural
sequence that in those 11 counties
the recovyit will be rejected for the
obvious reaeofi that, under law and
precedent where the sanctity of the
ballots has not been preserved in- 1
tact, the election certificates issued
by Texas officials will be the only
evidence the senate will receive.
"Thus I come to consider the re- 1
suit of the recount in the 33 coun- 1
ties out of the 49 where the ballots 1
have been apparently preserved in- j
tact. In these 33 counties. Senator 1
Mayfield shows an increase over the 1
official Texas count of approximately
1500 votes. Under the recount in 1
these 33 counties, Mayfield has in- 1
creased his official lead over Peddy
by a margin slightly in excess of 400 '
votes.
“If the public will read the re
sult of the recount as given to the
press daily by the officers conduct
ing the same, a fairly accurate know
ledge will immediately be gained of
the difference between the result of
the rcount and the official count is
sued by Texas officials. In the sen
ate recount Senator Mayfield is
running very substantially ahead of
the majority given him by the offi
cials of Texas.
“As a fair example, we might
mention Bexar county, a Peddy
stranghold. Mayfield gained 89 votes
over the official Texas count while
Peddy lost 113 votes, showing in that
county a net gain for Mayfield of 202
votes. This is a fair example of the
result of the recount generally where
the ballots have been preserved in
tact.
“This now brings me to a consider
ation of the wickedly false and ma
licious position publicly sasumed by
Mr. Peddy, his attorneys and those
furthering the cause of this mali
cious contest. The New York World,
the official mouthpiece of those fan
atic zealots is trying to control and
dictate to the people of Texas in pol
itical matters purely, of state con
cern. It takes a Dr. Butler, a resi
dent of New York, championed by
the New York World to lead the
fight to raise funds and thereafter
prosecute a political controversy e»-
sentially and wholly belonging to the
electorate of Texas. The people of

Butler in their effort to control or

“I do not believe in trying my suits
in or through the public press at
this time, however, the public needs
to know the truth touching the re
count. One only has to casually scan
the public statements of counsel for
Mr. Peddy in order to gain a fairly
accurate knowledge of the real mo-
’ive l ack of the Peddy contest. The
proponents of the contest do not ex
pect that Mr. Peddy will be seated
•is senator from Texas. In fact, 1
may be so bold as to say that these
men know that Mr. Peddy cannot be
seated. It is only hoped that under
guise of this contest, used as a
smoke-screen an unauthorized and
unprecedented investigation may be
had by the senate of the United
States touching certain alleged fra
ternal connections of Senator May
field.
“So far, it has cost the govern
ment of the United States approxi
mately $50,000 to conduct this re
count which Mr. Peddy, his counsel
and zealots well know, or by using
the least degree of human intelli
gence could easily ascertain, can nev
er and will never be used as evidence
by the senate committee charged
with the duty of investigating the
Texas senatorial contest.
“Over one-half of the ballot boxes
coming to Washington have keys at
tached; approximately one-third of
the precincts in the entire state had
the ballots removed from the boxes
and piled in basements, wood sheds
and other places, and later gathered
up by the deputy sergeant-at-arms
of the United States senate. In many
other cases the ballot boxes when
opened have been found to contain
ballots cast in the primaries, special
road bond elections, special school
election and many others. Any man
possessing even scant knowledge of
law and precedent knows that under
the conditions in which the Texas
ballots are found, this recount be
comes a farce, but for which farce
those malicious zealots (claiming to
be conscientious citizens) have spent
over $50,000 of the funds of the gov
ernment at this time much needed
in other matters.
“The intentionally and wilfully
false public utterances of counsel for
Peddy. from the inception of this
contest, brand the contest, for what
it is, a wickedly false contest spon
sored by unscupulous politicians, re
pudiated at home by the largest
majority in the history of Texas; it
is the old case of resentment that al
ways follows a sound public thresh
ing. This contest has been conceived
in sin and born in inquity. The ini
quitious purposes back of the farce
fathering this contest will be readily
apparent when the attempt is made
to introduce before the senate the
scandalous, impertinent and irreiev
ant hog-wash that will be tendered
on the part of the Peddy forces.
“We must remember that the re
count is purely mechanical and when
completed, the competent evidence,
if any, must be introduced before the
senate committee and then the peo
ple will learn the truth regarding
the recount; so far the senate com
mittee has not received any teesti
mony and until it has no one knows
in advance what action will be tak
en. In the meantime all stories or
statements to the effect that the re
count has been rejected in whole or
in part in any county are as false as
the man who utter the same.
“Senator Mayfield was elected by
over 136,000 majority and has qual
ified and is now creditably discharg
ing his duties as United States sena
tor from Texas and will so continue
as senator until his official term of
six years has expired.”

AMERICAN BLOC MAY OBTAIN
PASSAGE OF JOHNSON BILL
Congressman Cable of Ohio Would Form Patriots Into
One Body to Counteract Activities of “Foreign Bloc”
Which Is Using Every Means to Defeat Legislation.
Jews, Church Element, and Foreign Colonies Against Measure —
Twenty Members of New York State’s Delegation Come Out
Openly Against Restricting Incoming Aliens.
(Bnrrnu of Publication and (education)
WASHINGTON, I). C., March 3
Representative Cable, of Ohio, in a
speech on the floor of the house ad
vocated formulation of an “Ameri
can bloc” to combat what he termed
a “foreign bloc” working against the
Johnson immigration bill.
Representative Rankin of Missis
sippi, asserted that Democratic mem
bers of congress are receiving letters
threatening them with a Republican
administration next year, if they al
low the Johnson bill to pass. Rep
resentative Cable said the same was
true on the Republican side. So it
seems that the “foreign bloc” is work
ing on both parties, trying to play
one against tne other and threaten
ing both of them.
“If the immigration committee
would report out a bill suspending
immigration, I believe the house
would support it,” Mr. Cable de
clared. The Ohio member is also a
member of the house committee on
immigration.
Representative Johnson, of Wash
ington. author of the immigration bill
in the house and chairman of the
committee, declared there was no
hatred in the bill, adding that “the
quicker we close down on immigra
tion, the better we’U be.”
Representative Blanton, of Texas,
said that he believed the house would
stop immigration for at least five
years.
Look Who Attacks
Take a look at those who attack
the immigration measure. Jewish
members of congress. Catholics in
congress and in the pulpit, Italians,
and foreigners generally.
A public mass meeting to protest
against the passage of the Johnson
bill was held Sunday afternoon at the
Brooklyn, New York, Jewish center.
Eastern Parkway and Brooklyn av
enue. The speakers denounced the
Johnson bill as narrow minded and
prejudiced. Look who they were.
Congressman Samuel Dickstein, of
Manhattan, a member of the house
immigration committee, and Rev. Fa
ther Belford, pastor of the Roman
Catholic church of the Nativity,
Classon avenue and Madison street,
Brooklyn. The Catholic priest de
clared that the Ku Klux Klan was
the driving force back of the John
son bill.
Congressman La Guardia, also of
New York, was also a speaker. He
hit the nail on the head when he
said: “If the Johnson bill came up
in congress tomorrow it would pass
by an overwhelming vote.” He also
said the bill would by the figures of
the 1890 census cut the Jewish immi
gration from 80,000 to 4,000. The
Italian immigration would he re
duced from 45,000 to 3,000.
Klan Is Blamed
Congressman Dickstein said he was
a member of the committee “but I
don’t know that I ought to be proud
of that.” After reciting instances
of families kept apart by the law, he
said it was passed in the committee
by fear of too- fact that the country
might be flooded with immigration
from Europe as a result of the world
war. “The Klan is behind the smoke
screen of the census of 1890. The im
migration committee says to the
non-Nordic races; ‘You are undesira
ble.' If our forefathers could see what
tbeir sons are doing now they would
be ashamed of themselves.”
The Roman Catholic priest said:

REINSTATE PRINTING
DEPARTMENT WORKERS
Were Discharged by Late Presi
dent Harding Two Years
Ago
(Barenn of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 10.—
Seven men and three women, tearful
but exultant, have been reinstated in
their old positions in the bureau of
engraving and printing from which
they were banished two years ago by
the then President Harding. They
went out under mystery and suspi
cion with secret service agents at
their elbows. But now they are back
in their old jobs.
It's safe to predict that there will
be no more duplication of Liberty
bontft in that bureau and perhaps it
will be a long while before anyone
will attempt to again print the Pope's
head on our paper money. These peo
ple were reinstated after a long fight,
notwithstanding the amount of evi
dence special attorney Brewer of the
department of justice dug up.
If anyone doubts the power of the
Catholics in this government let him
wake up and rub his eves before it
is too late. A Catholic priest never
lets up when he is seeking to get his
people back into their old jobs, espe
cially if they are in position where
the Pope’s head can be printed on
United State* currency.
Sleepy old Protestants, go on nap
ping, and some day the White House
will have another Tumulty doing
business at the old stand.

DAKOTA SCHOOLS MAY
HOLD BIBLE CLASSES
Fear Stand May Load to Estab
lishment of State
Church
WASHINGTON. D. C., March 10.—
cussion of religious instruction in
North Dakota public schools, while
revealing differences of opinion, haa
brought out strong views that there
is danger of this latest educational
proposal leading eventually to some
form of a state church, in violation
of the fundamentals upon which the
United States were established.
Following the attorney general’s
opinion that North Dakota public
school pupils may not absent them
selves one hour weekly to receive in
struction in parochial schools, a
strong not approving this ruling and
demanding continued separation of
church and state has been sounded
by the Rev. E. P. Baker, pastor of
the Plymouth Congregational church
in Fargo.
He joins with Prof. C. I. Nelson of
the Fargo schools in declaring the
further belief that Bible instruction
as a part of school curriculum is il
legal.
Mr. Baker believes the church
should make use of pupils’ spare time
instead of encroaching upon public
school time.
Juniors Organize
In West Virginia
SUTTON. W. VA., March I.—A Jun
ior Ku Klux Klan was organized in
Sutton a recent evening when several
promising boys of the city between
the ages of 12 and 16 years were ini
tiated into the order. Following the
organization, and just as the Bland
theater was dismissing an unusually
large crowd, a fiery cross was seen
burning on the hill in South Sutton,
on the high point of the Canfield
farm. Quite a large crowd of people
witnessed the demonstration from
Main street and other points in the
cit. and for a while speculation was
rife as to the occasion, until the fact
of the Juniors organizing became cir
culated through the crowds. There
are several Junior Klans throughout
the state now, it is said.
Wig Wags from Washington
(Korean of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C„ March 3.
Tn a sermon on “Roman Catholicism
and the Ku Klux Klan,” Rev. Charles
E. Jefferson, speaking in a New York
church Sunday, said: “The Roman
Catholic church is arrogant, that it
snubbed and slandered the Protest
ant churches, that there were indi
cations it was in politics and that it
would attempt to get a share of the
public school funds.”
And then this minister had the au
dacity to say that all these things
did not justify an organization like
the Ku Klux Klan. He said the
members of the Klan are opposed to
the Catholic church because they are
afraid of it. He said that the fear
complex actuates its movements. He
also said that the Klan, afraid of
the Catholic hierarchy, was opposed
to Catholicism because the church
has a way of striking back.
In other words, the minister tried
to straddle. He admits the church
is wrong in doing the things the
Catholic church does, but that it
ought to be let alone, to go on and
on and finally as he predicts, trv to
get its share of the public school
funds. In other words, it’s all wrong,
but keep still and say nothing.
That minister has what some peo
ple call a gelatine spine. It bends
any old way.

WASHINGTON’S FIRST
MONUMENT IN RUINS
Bill Is Now Before Congress to
Repair Famous Granite
Tower
Rite .News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 10.—
According to local tradition, as well
as authorities in the library of con
gress, the first monument erected to
George Washington, president, gen
eral and Mason is that which now
stands a crumbling ruin 65 miles
from Washington midway between
Hagerstown and Frederick. It is on
the highest nob of the summit ridge
of the mountain, 1200 feet above
what is still a main route today.
The monument was erected by the
citizens of Boonsboro Maryland, in
1827 and dedicated on July 4 of that
year. At that time it was a conical
tower of granite, 54 feet around the
base, and 30 feet high, with a wind
ing stairway about it leading to an
observation platform on the top. The
tower was a lookout station in the
battle of South Mountain in the Civil
war.
It will cost little to rebuild the
structure, it is said, and a bill to ap
propriate the necessary funds has
been introduced in congress and re
ferred to a committee. The “Society
for Protection and Rebuilding of the
First Washington Mounment’’ (form
ed in 1917) is authority for the plans
of rebuilding, which include restora
ation to the original height, with
platform on top, a winding stairway
within, and a beacon burning nightly
that all who pass by motor from
north to soutn or along the great
highway from east to west may be
reminded of the man for whom it
stands.

business last Saturday the national
debt was $21,781,966,852. It has been

CONGRESS WILL HAVE TO SPEED UP WORK IF
MEMBERS ARE TO ATTEND PARTY CONVENTIONS

WASHINGTON, 1). C., March 4.
One year from today there will be an
other presidential inauguration in
Washington, and a man could make
a million or two right now if he
could positively guarantee who is to
be the lucky man that is to ride up
to the U. S. capitol, take the oath of
office and become the next president
of the United States, one year from
today.
At any rate the members of con
gress up on Capitol hill are beginning
to think it over and to speculate on
which party will win and who is to
land the big plum. They are also
beginning to wonder if this session
of congress is going to be over in
time to give the man opportunity to
attend the national conventions of
both major parties next June, as they
will want to do.
Warning was given in the senate
yesterday by Senator Warren, of Wy
oming, chairman of the senate com
mittee on appropriations, that pros
pects of adjournment of congress by
next June or even July will be out
of the question unless the senate be
gins to function as a legislative body
pretty soon.
The senator from Wyoming did not
seek to criticise the senate for its
actions during the last few months,
but sought merely to call attention
to the situation congress is in right
now. Last year at this time, all the
appropriation bills had been passed.
TOO MANY LAWS MADE

(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 11.—
That forty-eight legislatures besides
the national congress turn out more
laws yearly than can be understood
or enforced, is the contention of
many who see in the too large num
ber of enactments at every session,
the underlying reason for “the laws
delays” an dthe cries against “jus
tice only for the wealthy.”
To restate and simplify our legal
restrictions, to the end that we may
have a greater reverence for and
benefits from the laws, is the object
of the American law institute, which
has just closed its second annual
convention in the capital city.
During the session ,the members
heard reports of the progress of the
work on the restatement of the law.
a report on the classification of the
law by Roscoe Pound, dean of the
Harvard law school, and a report on
the defects in criminal justice by
a committee consisting of Herbert S.
