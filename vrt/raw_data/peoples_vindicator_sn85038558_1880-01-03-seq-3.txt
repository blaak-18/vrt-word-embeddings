The World for 1880, s
Democrats everywhere should inform me
themselves caretully alike of the action lei
of their party throughout the country wi
sad of the movements of their Republi- tk
can opponents. A failure to do this in TI
1576 contributed greatly to the loss by to
the Democracy of the fruits of victory Sc
fairly won at the polls. fta
The year 1880 pronmiee to be one of hil
the most interesting and important years re'
of this crowded and eventful century.
It will witness a Presidential election go
which may result in re-establishing the Ial
Government of this country on the prin- fa
ciples of its constitutional founders, or pe
in permanently chaning the selations to
of the States to the Iederal power. No p
intelligent man can regard such an ole. ti
tion with indifference. THE WORLD,
as the only daily English newspaper ec
published in the cily of New York which pa
upholds the doctrines of eonetitutlonal m
Democracy, will steadily represent the $
Democratic party in this great canvass. pr
It will do tbis in no spirit of servile pr. t
tisauhbip, but temperately and firmly.
As a newspaper The Wend, being the
organ of no man, ao clique and no In. AL

fairests it can make of eaeh day's

pear on the surfaice; it has no opinions
to sell, save those which may be had by
any purchaser with two cents. It hate'
injustice and rascality even more than it
hates unnecessary words. It abhors
foauds, pities fools, and deplores nin.
eompoops of every species. It will con
tinue throughout the year 1(80 to clans
time the first class, instruct the second,
and discountonaunc the third. All hon

And The Sun makes no bones of telling
the truth to its friends and about its
friends whenever occasion arises for
plain speaking.
These are the principles upon which
The Sun will be condulcicd durilig the
year to come.
The year 1880 will be one in which no
patriotic American can affolrd to close
his eyes to public affairs. It is imposnsi
ble to exaggerate the importance of the
political events which it has in store, or
the necessity of resolute vigilance onl
the part of every citizen who desires to
preserve theGovernmnent that the Ifoind
ere gave us. The debates and acts of
Congress, the utterances of the press,
the exciting contests of the Republican
and !Dumocratie parties, now nearly
equal in strength throughout the coun.
try, the varymng drift of public senti
ment, will all hear directly and effec
tively upon the 24th Presidential elec.
tion, to be held in November. Four
years ago next November, the will of the
nation, as expressed at the polls, was
thwarted by an abominable conspiracy,
the promoters and beneficiaries ofwhich
still hold the offices they stole. Will the
crime of 1876 be repeated in 1880 ? The
past decade ot years opened with a cor
rapt, extravagant and insolent Adminlis
tration intrenched at Washington. The
1 unn did something toward disloging tlh
gang and breaking its power. The sant,
r men are now intriguing to restore tlheir
a leader and themselves to places from
| which they were driven by the indigna
- tion of the people. Will they suceaed t
a The coming year will bring the answers
r to these momentous questions. The
u Sun will be on hand to chronicle the
facts as they are developed, and to ex
f hibit them clearly and fearlessly in their
a relations to expediency and right.
r. Thus, with a habit of philosophical
a good humor in looking at the miner at
I talm of lile, and in great thin, a stead.
