Sarsaparilla
Is widely known
as one of the most
effectual reme

and purif'ing the
blood. It has
stood the test of
years, with a con
stantly growing
reputation, based on its intrinsic virtues,
and sustained by its remarkable cures.
So mild as to be safe and beneficial to
children, and yet-so searchitng as to
el!i:ctually purge out the great corrup
tions of the blood, such as the scrof
ulous and syphilitic co(ntamin ation.
Impurities or dis;eases that have lurked
in the system for years soon yield to
this powerful antidote, and disappear.

which are publicly known, of Scrotiula,
and all scrofulous diseases, Ulcers,
Eruptions, and eruptive disorders of
the skin, Tumors. Blotches, Boils,
Pimples, Pustules, Sores, St.
Anthony's Fire, Rose or Ery
sipelas, Tetter, Salt Ithetum,
Scald Head, Ringworm, and in
ternal Ulcerations of the Uterus,
Stomach, and Liver. It also cures
other complaints, to which it would not
seem especially adapted, such as Drop
sy. Dyspepsia, Fits, Neuralgia,
Heart Disease, Female Weak
ness, Debility, and Leucorrhoea,
when they are manifestations of the
scrofillous poisons.

and strength in the Spring. lBy renew

and listless languor of the season.
Even where no disorder appears. people

the blood. The system moves on with
renewed vigor and a new lease of life.

No one remedy is louder
called for by the necessities
of the American people than
Ia sure and safe cure for
Fever and Agur. Such
we are now enabled to offer,
with a perfect certainty that
it will eradicate the disease, and with assur

arise from its use in any quantity.
That which protects from or prevents this
disorder must be of immense service in the
coummuitics where it prevails. P'rerenltio
is better titan cure; for the patient escapes the
risk which he must run in violent attacks of
this baleful distemper. This "CuUl" expels
the miasmatic poison of lever and Agae
from the system, and prevents the develop
Sment of the disease, if taken on the frst
approach of its premonitory symptoms. A
great superiority 4f this remedy over any
other ever discovered for the speedy and cer
tain cure of Intermittents is, that it contains
no Quinine or mineral; consequently it pro.
duces no quinisnm or other injurious effects
whatever upon the constitution. Those cured
by it are left as healthy as if they had neoverm

Summer and Autumn, and remarka

heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful iniluence upon thiso vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Drt. J. WALKEZsR'S VIEGAIR
BITraRS, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis.
ease by purifying all its fluids with
VINEGAR BITTERS. No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus fore-armed.

dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thaou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re

system from worms like these Bitters.
ForFemaleComplalnts, in young

that improvement is soon pere~ptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impurities bursting
through the skin in ,Pimpl, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
