The ne.
How any man In the S uth, or
North for that matter, can misunder
stand the ossue between the Blepublit
s en and Demoratic parties, surpass.
- *s our understandlng.
. Bern we have a few men who think
and act upon the thought, that
"more money" is what is wanted to
make the country again prosperous,
full of energy, and to sooeure perma
als nently our IIberties.
If tbl Idea ieo ried out them ls*
at. kewi be tftal.
-a The etra sessilo of Congress
a marlbked plainly the line between
ep Demoeraey and Republieanlm. The
, ltter demands of the people the
power to coerce them in the exercise
n of their rights at the ballot boi,
e: th troops, marshals and supervl
as uors.
n. The Democracy, on the contrary,
malntalp the free, untrammelled
right of the dlts~ to vote as he
,leasm, subject only to State regala
l cons.
How do the Oreenbackers expect
suoh an issue a this to subordinate
' Itself to their obhldish question-a
question of more money, and rag
mht oney at that?
Our liberties, and the free exercise
thereof, are at stake and the true
ea of this coutry are not to be
ed led off on the dlse plea set up by
or. men for mere personal ends.
Let our people stand together uon
til this question is decIded-It will be
th time then to talk of more money.
k The Ward meetings throughout
be this parish have, we believe, all ta.
ken place, and the Democracyr s
ittil united, full of vim and ready
Ili for the fray.
be At oetlme, as is usual, t was re
me p that serious dloulties were
belg Democratic ranks, whihob
Sould probably result Ina split nl
he party, a test, however, of the
'nettle of the partty showed that
bee were Idle rumors.
The meetine l this Ward was the
s areest ever held, and we hear that
4 bher Wrd meetings have been full,
,e well as enthu,lastl. All this
he shows the deep interest taken In
poltical afairs, which is as It shouldI
be.

- MR. J. H. NORMAnxD, Clottierville, La.
Dear Sir-After stuffering for thirty th
years from a rulinlg nicer in the ear
t ccasioned by a wagon Il*.siilg on my
head and after havilrt been operated
n"on by Dr. Logan in New Orleans and
sliand not being cred. I tried somte ofyour pr
halm and Iam happy to say that after a
Sfew applheations ol it I got entirely well
n and was radically cured.
A negro boy ol lily place cut his toot
with a plow and it was thuaghtonce C
that it wouldl have to be amputated but
aftier applying your balm on the wound
for a few days it healed up and the boy Di
is now well. Again, George Cole, a
neighbor of mine, whilst shooting a gun,
a piece ofthe cap flew in his eye, we
tried the balim again anId with suceees.
His eye got well after two applicatious tb
of th balml. ah
S I eonclnde by stating that in my opin.
ion your balm is an ivaluable medicine

Gents-I tue pleasure in recommnend- cal
ing your B Iii. I have always found it Na
elencaious. Some four years ago an old tic
colored servant of ,ine was confined to 7,
her bed with an ulcer on her leg. My otl
wife believing strongly in the virtue of on
your Balni, concluded to use some of it tal
and in a very short time effected a cure. bel
The old woman is now well and able to do
testify to the same.
