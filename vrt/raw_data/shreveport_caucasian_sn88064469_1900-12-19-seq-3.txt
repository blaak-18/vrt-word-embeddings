which had been premented to the non
f ductor and then made his euoape with a
number ..t regintered mail pamkagee.
The watch of Kinnabrew was found on
the d@md man wbich leaves no doubt of
his identity as leader of the gang who
held up the train. Sinoe laat Saturday
OChief Mnrray and other detective@ of
the Illinois Oentral have been buaily at
work on the case, following the clew
given them by the discovery of the
bloody cartridge belt aar the soene of
the robbery.
It will be recalled that Joat after the
holdup Special Offloers Daly and Lu~iob
of the Illinote Central hastened to the
scene. Nuar the Oarrollton trolley oar

disoovered two men carrying a bag and
walking rapidly between the Illinots

Daly and Lucoch halted the men, but in
stead of surrendering the largeat of the
two drew a pistol and began shooting. i
Both Daly and Iiooiob reeponded and a
lively fusillade followed. The men ~al. 1
ly dropped the bag and &ed. The bag 1
was found to be a United Statem mail o
pouch. The next morning a bloody ar- o
tridge belt was found. The iovestiga. I

At an early hour yesterday their
searoh was rewarded with the findlag
of the body. It was that of a man wbo
had suuoambed to the effect of his
wound and exposure. An examination
