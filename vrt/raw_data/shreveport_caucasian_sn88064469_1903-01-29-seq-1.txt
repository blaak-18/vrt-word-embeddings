WHISKEY CRAZED.
W. S. Wilson Shot by Sergeant Gerald
in the Hunter Hotel.
Monday morning W. S. Wilson,
whose name is also William Snoder,
was shot by Sergeant Gerald in the
Hunter hotel, near the Union Depot.
Wilson or Snoder is from Texas and
had a railroad ticket to Tuscaloosa,
Ala. There was also found on his per
son $33 in money, a gold watch and an
empty flask which had contained whis
key. The man had been laboring under
an intense nervous strain--an halluci
nation--during which he believed he
was being robbed. Being noisy and dis
orderly and refusing to be quieted, a
policeman was called. Sergeant Gerald
being on duty near by, answered the
summons and was soon joined by Pa
trolman Byland. Wilson had locked
himself in a room which he was per
suaded to open by a woman. As Wil
son opened the door he rushed out with
an open knife with a three-inch blade,
with which he slashed at Patrolman
Byland, whose garments wete cut in
several -places. One of these slashes
pricked the skin over Byland's heart.
Wilson had become crazed and was un
controllable. He was on murder bent,
and Sergeant Gerald realizing the emer
gency, fird on shot and Wilson fell.
Fortunately he was not killed, but -he
struggled desperately before the knife
was wrenched from his hand.
The shot passed through the muscles
of the abdomen and intestines and is not
considered dangerous. Wilson will
doubtless recover. An investigation into
the shooting leads `to the justification of
Sergeant Gerald. Besides the police of
cers, others in the hallway were in
4adgr of being stabbed and killed.
