is the birthday aitniversary f Jeffer
son Davis, President of the Confederate
States.
In Louisiana Memorial Day has been
observed on April 6, the anniversary of
the first day's battle of Shiloh, where
thousands of Louisianians yielded their
lives for the Cause which led them to
sacrifice the comforts and their loved
ones at home for the sanguinary field,
but while there was much to the credit
of State pride in such memorial celebra
tions, it was confined to within the ter
ritorial borders of Louisiana, as other
such events were limited to the States
in which glorious victories were won.
In fixing June .3 as the Confederate
Memorial Day, there will be given to
the event an historical connection. a
positive recognition of a man who as
the head of the Southern Confederace.
represented -in his persotlality as well as
in his official captcity all that which
was dear and must ever be sacred to the
South.
In response to the suggestions of the
Confederate Veterans 1n session at Dal
las, the General Assembnix of Louisiana
has fixed June 3 as a legal holiday,
which will, beyond a doubt. be observed
not only in this State but throughout
the South, as a day when the people
may gather in their respective sections
and lay on the graves of the braves the
floral tributes emblematic of their loy
alty to the departed, an emphasis of
their love for those who were near and
dear to them. Therefore, under the new
order. Memorial Day in Louisiana will
not be celebrated on April 6.
DEMOCRATIC RULE.
The Governor's only function fcr
years has been to manipulate patronage
as a bribery fund.-Harlequin.
This observation is more forceful
than poetical. As the Caucasian has de
clared frequently, the Governor of
Louisiana is vested with more power
than the Governor of the State of New
York. His power is autocratic. In the
name of Democracy he may set aside
the wishes of a majority of the people
for his own sweet will. If the Demo
crats who vote would assert themselves
it is. now in order to organize for busi
ness. If the Democrats who vote believe
they, should have. "a boss," then they
must stop "kicking" and salute the
Governor as the Great Hi Muckee
Muckee, the Infallible and the All
Powerful, against whose decree it were
treason to suggest opposition or criti
cism. A return of all power to the peo
ple is the only safeguard for the peo
ple. The rule by the people is Demo
cratic.
Some of Cleveland's friends are
grooming him for the presidential race
and-certain defeat.-Progressive Age.
If nominated, to defeat as certain as
death; but Grover Cleveland will never
be nominated. In a political sense he is
like he Irishman's turtle whose head
had been clipped from its body and was
moving around at a lively pace. "Oh!"
exclaimed Pat, somewhat bewildered,
"the baste is ded but he doesn't know
it!"
The Guardian-Journal suggests that
"The time is approaching when the best
thing that many of us can do will be to
drop everything else an dgo a fishing."
