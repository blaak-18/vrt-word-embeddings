Congressman Sibley, the only it

favors the free coinage of silver, Wt
made a speech one day recently in mi
which he took occasion to split the re
President up and down the spinal
column with no delicate modesty.

as '" combination of brains, brass

In applying such language to the sh

Congressman has made an indecent ec
display of himself. A man who of
has enough sense to be elected to tt
Congress and descends to the art "of d

Mr. L. Benson, a gentleman who n
is delivering lectures on temperance
in the northen part of the State, got 1
drunk at Robeline last Monday and p
'was robbed of $75 by a hotel porter. w
Benson is only one of a large number tl
,of hypocrites who go about the coun
try telling the people how to behave
when their own, private lives would C
shame the most hardened sinner. ti
--Lafayette Gazette. a
If you could see Luther Benson r
and hear hini talk, listen to him as
he delivers his lectdri i8on would be
more charitable Bro. Mouton. Mr.
Benson is one of those unfortunate F
men whom that fearful disease, i
thirst for liquor, has a strong grasp c
upon, and it is pitiful and pathetic 1
indeed to hear him tell of his battles
with the tempter. He is absolutely
devoid of pomposity but is instead t
the very acme of modesty and shows
that he realizes his infirmities and
dreads the approach of the dreaded
monster, his appetite for drink. '
The unfortunate man did fall at
.obeline but he is vastly more to
bt pitied than censured; as he is in
Sno sense a hypocrite, we think, and
does an immense amoent of good
for the temperance cause.
Give him the charitable hand of
pity, brother, not the contemptuous 1
'look of scorn.-Shreveport Pro
gress.
WVe cheerfully apologize to
S rother Luther and admit that we
might have b~en less severe in our
remarks. TI'he reports about Mr.
Benson justified us in classing him
S ith a large number of men who
: travel through the country as tem

"ethnb one can ascribe the miscar- ]ss'
riage to any dereliction on the inS
part of the prosecutor, for he has res
well done his work; no one can
impagn the honesty and upright- Pla
ness of the judges, for they have jec
also acted justly and according to tin
the law. The fault lies in the prac- ab
tice of the law, which permits tech- ]1e
nicalities. Under the word techni- the
calites are included so much that its
to inrgehid~s attorheys, the defeiit 'C
'bf justice becomes an easy matter.
To `the lay mind it seems -that often- lea
times that if a little more common ka
sense and a little less -leghl "hinety ci:
were used -in t"ials that there would «'
be a marked improvement. But as th
it is, so much care is used tb "pre- so
vent an injustice to an individual, Cl
that society finds fiseJ1 continually sa
outraged. Evidently then we need, of
and need badly, some remedial fo
legiislation, not a makeshift nor gc
patchwork, but a thorough over- al
hauling of the laws. Certainly ac
there shou'ld be availahle men who fix
are competent to devise -a mdthod Je
of proceedure which would remove cl
the objectionable technicalities. to
At present it is possible to pro- Je
long or postpone a trial indefi- m
nitely, and when -the -lawyers agree of
to a trial, defeat the whole case on cl
a technicality. in
By all means some effort should bi
be made to correct and revise the la
law as it now stands. It may cost ci
the State a large sum of money; but cc
it will in the end save it more. By h`
removing the temptation to commit sl
wrong -by placing certain punish- t
a ment, the criminal expenses will be 01
reduced, more than enough to over- b'
pay the sum expended. re
CORRUPTION IN IIIGII J
PLA CES. t
The revelations of the Lexow ax
committee, the disclosures of cor- P,
ruption in New Orleans, Chicago, b,
. and other large cities, should make 'V
us pause and ask why these things fl,
e should be so. Long ago money It
a has been branded as the root of all e'
t evil, and undoubtedly that is the C
o one cause Wrhich has so debauched t<
o the municipal go-ernments of the tl
f day. Money per se is an excellent b
a institution in that it facilitates com P
L- merce and makes possible progress- h
o ive civilization; but unfortunately b
ir prosperity introduces luxury, and c
develops a love of display. This t
soon creates classes, and it is the I
0 natural ambition of man to rise. s
, In our land at present, money is the t
,d passport and money the means a
r. which sustains the classes, so that
!r there seems now one universal de- -
I sire for wealth. Since our public c
Id conscience ignores the means taken I
r. to secure wealth and bows in hom- I
age to its possessor, there is no t
n restraint placed upon dishonesty
is provided it be successful. With
such a public opinion, honor and
te probity lose their virtue, and there
e, is nothing surprising when we find
sP corruption in high places, especial
ic ly, where office is for sale to the
s highest bidder, and an honest elec
ud tion the dream of our forefathers.
5s Corruption is not to be legislated
ad oat 6 existen-e. In a government
where the people are sovereigns, it
t cannot be expected that the officers
o of a government will rise superior
n to that government. It is only in
d the virtue of the people themselves,
that any reform is to be born.
of When honesty becomes a badge of
us honor, Plpurity of life a title ot nobil
ro- ity, and beneficience the admiration
of all men, then and then only,
to will our government become an in
we stitution, the light of mankind and
ur the joy of earth.

n The financial condition of the
he United States has reached such a
to critical point that Congress has at

hard to even guess. President Cleve
land fearing that precious time
Iw would be wasted in the usual wind

ut emphasize the necessity of imme

t ka, contrlibtites a severe but jtdi- bu
i cial and unimpassioned criticism of
*"The President's Currency Plan" to nt
s the February Arena. These ate all
some of his points: He says Mr.
Clevlatud raises an issue in his iitise
Y sage that will not be finally disposed th
, of un'tl bank notes are substituted
LI for all government paper, of until re!
,r government paper is substituted 'for
-all bank notes. His position is ex
y actly opposite to that taken by the Cu
0 first Democratic President, Thomas un
d Jeffersoht. Mr. Cleveland has de- th
e clared the issuance of paper money
. to be the function of the banks.
- Jefferson regarded the issue of paper ar
money as more properly a function In
e of governmenrt. Mr. Cleveland de- In
a clares that "'the absolute divorce
inent of the government from the ur
fol
d business of banking is the ideal re
lationship of the government Lo the op
t circulation of the currency of the
t country." Jefferson, on the other
hand, fought for such legislation as tel
t should make the banks go out iof
_tlie governing business and attend Pa
e only to the legitimane business of ca
banking. This, with the the cur
rency, or any portion of exchange,
in their control, they will never do.
Jefferson wrote on this matter: "'In- tr
terdict forever, to both the State ii.
w and national '~oirer'trents, the j
r- power of establishing any paper an
banks, for without this interdiction i
:e we shall have the same ebbs and a
s flows of medium, and the same revo- 1t
y lutions of property to go through s:
11 every twenty or thirty years." S1
e Congressman Bryan shows how ut- at
:d terly disastrous to every interest in ,
te the community, except that of the
at bankers, the CSevcand Carlisle
a plan would be in operation, and -
,s- how all the old evils of the State
ly bank :.ys t, with its loss and in- A
id convenience, and its pressure upon
is the debtor would be upon us again.
se In the case of any great pan:c, say
,e. such a fearful panic as that of '93,
he the value of bank notes would sink
as almost to zero and gold would be
at at a greater premium than ever. a
e- The evil to be remedied is the apprc- c:
ic ciation of gold. The President's F
en plan only aggravates this, and Con
n- gressman Bryan's final point is that
no the only thing that will bring relief,
;ty and an adequate volume of stay-at
th home money for the people is the
restoration of silver at the present
legal vatio of i6 to i, and a proper
tre system of national paper invested
