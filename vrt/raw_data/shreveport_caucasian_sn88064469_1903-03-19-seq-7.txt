It ir 1h:- p0 er niva vested in the
t vi. rnutr t' safegu' ard the people at a
titme wheni the Stite was in peril. but
there is now no dianger since the people
who have the right to govern are in full
psse-0ion of the State. Under the pres
ent system of appointment the people
are not only relieved of the authority of
electing officers to positions appointive,
but in a vacancy such as sheriff, for in
stance, the wishes of the people may be
nullified altogether, as was practically
demonstrated in Lincoln parish recently
where there was a vacancy resulting
from the death of the sheriff of that par
ish. In such case, untier the law, the
coroner of the parish assumes charge
until the vacarcy is filled. When this
vacancy occurred the citizens of Lin
cii expressed a desire to have such
vacancy filled by one who would repre
sent the majority of the Democrats of
the parish, and naturally requested the
Democratic parish committee to order a
primary election, at which the Demo
crats would le given an opportunity of
declaring their choice. It was under
stood and agreed to that the man receiv
ing . ich majority should be the sheriff.
Accordingly the Democratic parish com
mnittee fixed a date for such primary,
wblot provoked the ire of Governor
Heard to a degree which surprised his
friends. The Governor immediately and
unceremoniously squelched the comniit
tee who had advised him and desired a
delay in the appointment until the people
could speak. Not only were the people
willing but the several candidates read
ily acquiesced in a proposition which
was fair and Democratic. It is unneces
sary to qupte what Governor Heard said
except that he declared that the people
had no authority and that he had al
ready appointed the mttn, Mr. Mayfield,
and he intimated that no other need ap
ply, There cotild he no. objection urged
against Mr. Mayfield, a gentleman es
teemed for his personal worth, and who
had b+en the dead sheriff's chief deputy,
and it is not this appoinatement as the
would-be rebuke of Governor Heard to
the Democrats of Lincoln parish for
their assumption 'of authority which is
vested in home alone, which should be
emphasized.
It is true a primary would have re
quired a' delay in compliance with for
malities and technicalities, and in a close
malities and technicalities, and in a
close construction of the law the
acting sheriff could not have col
lected the taxes due and also that
such delay would have perhaps incon
venienced people who desired to liqui
date their debts to the parish and State,
but the Democrats of Lincoln committed
no act to which Governor Heard should
have taken offense. The power which is
exer:ised by the Governor is supposed
to be from the, people, who are some
times flattered as sovereigns and are
sovereigns when they determine to be.
It is clear to our mind-that the apologies
and explanations in favor of the Gov
ernor cafl add little to his credit, and he
has forced himself in, a position which is
not in harmony with his declarations
and enunciations of alt rights being
vested in the people. But our purpose is
not so much a critiicsm of the Governer
for exercising a prerogative given him
by law as it is to call the people's atten
tion to and to emphasize the necessity of
relieving the Governor of much if not
all the appointive power he possesses,
and with this and other issues before
which- the claims of individuals are
mininized. The one man power is no
longer a necessity. The people are the
power and the power must be returned
to the people. If not, why not?

5kyreekets Before Gampowder.
It matters very little in the long run
to the small boy when, how or where
fireworks were first made and of what
they are made now. But the fact re
mains that the despised heathen Cli
nese first made them and used them
and that civilised communities did not
know of them until the fourteenth cen
tury. The skyrocket was first invented
toward the clqse of the ninth century
and at that time was used, so it is said,
in India and China in war. That was
long before the Invention of gunpow

Orasmental Jade.
The Chinese have cut jade for ages.
but never ornamented it except by
sculpture. When it was Introduced in
to India, the native Jewelers, with their
quick eye for color, at once saw what
a perfect ground it afforded for mount
ing precious stones, and they were the
first to incrust them on jade. The In
dia museum in London possesses the
choicest specimens of this, work known
of the best mogul period.

A Ghost Test.
When you think you see * gfost,
how can you tell whether it really is
a ghost or not? A recent writer gives
the following scientijic inetlhod: "We
assume that a person sees an appari
tion. It may be objective-i. e.. having
existence outside the observer's mind-
or merely a creature of a disordered
brain, subjective. The seer, while look
ing at the vision with both his eyes.
gently depresses one eyeball with his
forefinger from outside the top eyelid,
I so causing a squint. If objective.
whether Ionus or not. two outlines of
the 'ghost' will be seen, but one, of
course, if it be subjective. One may
prove this by trial any tinli with any
object, near or far. I mention this be
cause of the many nervous and brain
wearied people who see spooks and to
whom it would he better that they
should know that the trouble is with
in themselves and so seek a capable
doctor than continue to be haunted, as
they believe, by the supernatural."
The Rocking of Lake Erie.
The 250 mile trough of Lake Erie lies
approximately in the direction of the
west to southwest winds which prevail
in that part of the country. Thus the
lake offers an excellent opportunity for
studying the effects of the wind upon
a large body of inclosed writer, and
very interesting these effects some
times prove. Rhythmic gusts produce
a rocking motion and great blows from
the west or southwest sweep the liquid
body of the lake eastward and some
times cause a rise of eight feet or more
at Buffalo In the course of a few hours.
As soon as the maximum force of the
gale has tpassed the water swings back.
Continued rockings are observed on
days when the strength of the wind
fluctuates.-Youths Companion.
Pabri' of Daily Life.
It is not of lofty or heroic deeds that
the enduring pattern of character is
woven, but rather of the seemingly
small things of life. Little unheralded
acts of helpfulness. slight self denials
that bar against selfishness, conscien
tious attention to trifling details of du
ty, standing firm to the right in spite
of banter and contempt (really the most
difficult thing for young or old to with
stand), adherence to scrupulous hones
ty in word and deed even in what oth
ers consider of no import, sticking to
principle though one may. be called
"old fashioned," "unprogressive" or
"puritanical" - these are the golden
strands which, woven into the fabric
of daily living, make men and women
invincible.-Success.
Mistake In the Locality.
That keen rivalry which western
towns feel is probably responsible for
the story about Seattle, which may well
have been said of some other place at
some other time. It concerns a Seattle
man who died and went to the here
after.
"I don't see," he remarked, after a
casual survey of' his new quarters,
"that heaven Is so much better than
Seattle."
"But this isn't heaven," explained a
bystander.-New York Tribune.
How the Ancients Regarded Irom
The ancient Egyptians believed that
Iron was the bone of Typhon, the ene
my of Osiris, and for this reason it was
considered Impure. No one could make
use of it even for the most ordinary
requirements of life without polluting
his soul in a way that would cause
him harm both on earth and in the
other world.
Reading.
Were I to pray for a taste which
should stand me in stead under every
variety of circumstance and be a source
of happiness and cheerfulness to me
during life and a shield against ills,
however things might go amiss and
the world frown upon me, it would be
a taste for reading.-Sir John Herschel.
He Had.
"Have you ever written anything:"
said his cynical friend, "to make the
world happier or better?"
"Rather," quoth the insurance agent
who sometimes dabbled in verse. "4
have written $400,000 worth of life in
surance within the last year."
What Did He Mean?
He-What lovely flowers! Do you
know, they remind me of you.
She-Why, they are artificial.
He-Yes. I know. but it requires close
examination to detect it.
Talking y.':r enthusiasm to some
people is like A siing it under the
