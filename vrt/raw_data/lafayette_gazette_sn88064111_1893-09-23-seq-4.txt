KENNEDY'S
MEDICAL DISCOVERY.
DOALD IEUIIEDY, OF ROXBURY, MASS.,
Has discovered in one of our common
pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
down to a common Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit is always experienced from
the first bottle, and a perfect cure is war
ranted when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains, like needles passing
through them; the same with the Liver or
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts being
stopped, and always disappears in a week
after taking it.
If the stomach is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of it.

of the grounds, so little visited by
many of the people who go to the fair,
contains some of the most interesting
features of the exposition. 'There are
the cliff dwellings, the Yucatan ruins,
the Forestry building, Dairy building,
Leather building and the Live Stock de
partment. People are frequently heard
to remark: "Oh, I don't care about go
ing away over there. There isn't any
thing worth seeing over there," etc.;
but those who do tale the trouble to
walk a few blocks further are well re
paid for the extra exertion by the rare
sights which greet their eyes in that
direction.
The Forestry building contains some
of the most beautiful specimens of pol
ished and rough woods ever displayed
in the world. The building itself is a
study in rustic architecture and well
worth inspection.
LARGEST PLANK INTI WORLd

At the extreme southern end of the
building is shown the largest plank in
the world. It is of redwood, from
Humboldt county, Cal. Of it the fol
lowing description is given:
"The great tree from which the plank
was hewn was thirty-five feet in diam
eter, when standing, and was supposed
to have reached the patriarchal age of
ffteen hundred years. A part of one
side of the tree had rotted, and, after it
had been fel~d, In burning up the sur
rounding brush. still more of the tree
was destroyed by fire, so that the width
-of the plank represents less than half
of the original diameter of the tree.
The entire height of the tree was three

It ranges from two to ten feet in diam

sixteen feet in diameter, the tree being
three hundred and five feet high
and three hundred years old. Great
slabs of noble fir, spruce, lovely fir and
yellow fir are shown.
Some of the state exhibits are partic
ularly fine. Minnesota shows the trunk
of a great Norwegian pine. In the cen
ter of the pavilion is a booth wreathed
in vines, the effect being very good.
Ohio's pavilion is similar in design to
the state building, and the mining and
agricultural pavilions. Tree trunks
support the roof of the structure. There
are panels showing leaves, and sections
with and against the grain of the trees
of the state. Prominent among the
woods is displayed a specimen of the
buckeye.
Michigan's display is elaborate.
Among the objects of interest is a cane
curiously carved. West Virginia dis
plays white ash, maple and spruce
amond other varieties of wood. North
Carolina displays photographs of her
trees, as well as specimens of her woods.
There is a curious settee of rhododen

moss are shown. Indiana makes an at
tractive display of the woods of the
state, both in their natural condition
and polished. A pile of second growth
timber is displayed.
An exhibit of especial interest is that
of the Jessup collection of woods in the
United States from the American Muse

The state of this name adopted a novel
method for displaying its woods. A
thin section of the wood of each tree is
mounted in a frame with a photograph
and leaves of the tree itself. These

ations on hfs farm. He needs partiun
i t.axly a lvel head at this seamen of the
wvenr vhlaen, we regret to say, the coam
"munity ii tneiral, are' lIslng their
heads on the question of finances. We
Smention several ways in which farmers
may do aim unwise thing, and we fear
m any of their are doing it.
, 1. Many £dsmers are doitag them
selves very great injury byloeit con
fidence in the financial system ptf. the
country, and especially in the sound
ness of the banks in their neighbor
hood, and therefore, withdrawing their
rdeposits, and thus taking them
out of the general circulation.
It is within the power of the farmers
of the United States at any time to
bring on a panic which will affect the
entire country, and other countries as
t well, by simply taking their deposits
out of the banks and keeping them at
home. - This involves such a violent
contraction of currency that it is felt
t in every avenue of business. Farm
ers generally believe that in so doing
they are making sure of what they
have, acting with supreme conserva
tism, and as they term it, "making
k themselves safe." There is nothing
- they could do that would make them
I more unsafe, for the reason that any
thing disturbing public confidence nec
" essarily stops business, throws labor
I out of employment, -increases crime,
5 stops production in other lines and
e robs him of his own market. If the
6 laboring men can not get employment
d they can not buy farm products, and
e as a matter of course prices of farm
B products must fall and the reaction
comes upon the farmer in full force.
The result of it is a stoppage of fac
e tories, and throwing labor out of em
ployment necessarily means exceeding
Sly low prices for farm products. Fac
a tories must stop when there is a vio
lent contraction of the currency, and
the farming operations being the great
interest of the west, any sudden with
drawal of money from banks destroys
confidence. It takes years to build up
3 a confidence that can be destroyed in
a months.
a 2. We think that farmers are mak
ing a mistake in holding their farm
I products in hope of higher prices. We
believe that on their merits every
thing produced on the farm this year
should bring a good price, provided
consumption of farm products go on.
If this stops from any reason prices
must necessarily fall to the limit of
their consumption, and no power can
advance them except for a brief period.
Speculation may depress them for a
brief period below it, but after all the
permanent range o* prices is deter
mined by the consumption of products.
Anything. therefore, that stops con
sumption depresses prices and inflicts
no end of suffering. We think it spe
cially unwise to hold crops for specula
tion at the close of the season when a
bountiful harvest of almost everything,
with the exception of wheat, is in pros
pect. Of course accident may happen
any crop as yet. The exact measure of
the crops of the season has not been de
termined as yet, and some of them will
not be for sixty days. but the present
condition indicates that there will be
no nscrcity of anything grown on the
farm. We should therefore expect.
under ordinary circumstances, good
prices, but not excessive, for the reason
that there is no very great surplus of
any one crop. If. however, from any
reason consumption decreases, the price
necessarily decreases, and we there
fore think it a. good time to be closed
out of last year's crops and send them
on the market of the world.
It is especially hazardous to hold
crops when the farmer is in debt.
Liquidation is now the order of the
day, and the more complete it is the
quicker will be the recovery.
Therefore. if we have any advice to
give-our readers it is that when they
have anything that is ready for the
market, sell it. Prices may go higher
after awhile, but unless there be a
speedy restoration of confidence, they
will undoubtedly go lower.
It is a good rule to sell any crop on
the farm when it is "eady. The man
who adopts the habit of selling hogs,
cattle or whatever else he may have
when they are fit to go, no matter
what the market may be. will usually
come out the best in the long run.
Many men have made money by be
ing indebted to banks which required
immediate payment, and, in a word,
forced them to sell their stock. Some
times they have lost. and as a rule will
lose when the stuff is not fit to go.
When it is fit to go, the man vho is
compeled to sell is sometimes quite
fortunate.
The man who imagines that every
thing is going to be bow-wows because
for a time there is a stringency in the
money market is making a great mis
take. Consumption to some extent
must go on. People must eat and must
be clothed. These things can not stop
altogether. Production also must go
on. The sun does not cease to shine
because some men are panic-stricken.
The pigs, lambs, calv~s and colts keep
right on growing, coif stores up its fat
ness just as rapidly when bankers are
calling in loans as when they are out
on the streets on a hunt for good bor
rowers. Prices in the west are not
abnormally high. There has been no
rash speculation among farmers to
speak of. Neither has there been over
trading among the merchants. There
is plenty of money in the country to do
all the business of the country, and
there is nothing the matter except
men. like children, are seeing spooks
or ghosts in the graveyard. Under
these conditions no calamity can fall
on the west, except such as western
people bring on themselves by failing to
keep a level head.--Wisconsin Farmer
AUTUMN FOALS.

sprtang reats.
At this season of the year many far
mers anre wondering whether or not
it will be profitable to try and raise
foals fromn the .mares that must assist
in doing the w6rk on the farm. Where
mares are depended on to do a great
share of the farm work there is no
doubt but what their being in foal

farmeris who ae not raising trotters
for turf purpoSalone. -
As .w general thing and speaking from
experience it may be taken as almost
eertain that the foal that is dropped in
autumn, after the flies cease to be
troublesome, and the scorching hot
weather is over, will in its yearling
form surpass the one that was foaled
any time between the middle of July
and the first of September. Indeed
for some reasons it is preferable to
have the autumn foal dropped neares
the first of October than the first of
S eptember.
A very large number of foals dropped
in the two months of July and August
die before they are a week old from
the traublesome bowel complaints that
r are always much more fatal in the e-.
tremely hot seasons than at any other
time, and even when they live, the eof
fects of the weather,- the lies and the
short pasturfge on which their dr ms
are oftentimes forced to get their liv
Ing give them a set-back that the well
cared for autumn foal never gets.
Farm mares that are bred so as to
produce foals in the fall are in no way
incapaeitated from doing their full
share of the spring work, and as the
farm work after that time is not bard
they need not be thrown out of use at
all excepting for the first ten days after
the birth of the foal. Then with a lit
tie extra attention the foal will begin a
hearty growth that need never be
checked.
In the early fall a ration of green
forage will be found an excellent as
well as convenient way of keeping up
the mare's flow of milk. Sowed corn
isa first-class article for this purpose,
and where it is grown alfrlfa may
also be used. As the cooler weather
comes a box stall should be provided
for mare and foal and the rationT for
the mare should be of food calculated
to keep up the milk supply. The usual
feed of oats should give way to ground -
oats, bran, middlings and even ground
rye mixed in proper proportions. The .
feed should be fed in a box in which
the foal can also get to it and he will
begin to partake of it in a surprisingly
short time, in fact the writer has
known of some foals that commenced
to eat such feed at five weeks of age.
WVhen spring comes, autumn foals
that have been treated in this manner
will be found to be not much behind
the spring fools in point of size, and
ahead of those foaled in July and Au
gust. They will also be eating grain
nicely and may be weaned without
stopping their growth. Then, tgo, the
pastures will be all ready to turn themta
into and the dams will again be ready'
to take part in the spring farm work.

[ Pulverized Soil.
W-e performed an experiment many.
1 years ago which exhibited very di.
tinctly the difference between a crop
growing in a finely-pulverized soil and
in one cultivated in the common, rough
manner. The land was hard and
cloddy, and was not fit for a fine crop.
It was taken in hand when the weather
I[was dry enough to favor fine pulveriza
tion. Paralled drills were made for
roots, and to make them perfectly
mellow, a log, drawn with a horse by
one end, was passed successively along
these proposed drills. The whole was
thus finely powdered. Beets were then
planted in these drills, and the mellow
condition kept up through the season.
The result was, in a high degree, eatis
factory, and the beets raised in these
drills far exceeded those under codimon
management. A better mode of pul
verizing may be devised, but tb s ex
ample is given, not to show the nuode,
but to give the result--American Cul
tivator.
HERE AND THERE.
--Prevention is cheaper and better
than cure. WVhen an animal is sick it
should be removed at once from all
others of its kind.
-Give level culture and avoid hand
labor on the potato crop andt thus
cheapen production. Sort thoroughly
before taking to market to secure the
top price.
-The farmer makes a financial fail
ure less often than any other business
man. While he seldom achieves great
wealth, he has a pretty sure road to
comfortable independence.
-The worst idea that a farmer can
get into his head is that he needs more
land. We have seen a good many
farms, but seldom one where more la
bor could not be better employed than
more land.
-It will be found an advantage to
clean out the hay loft and sweep it
thoroughly before new hay is stored.
The number of mice and insects found
snugly domiciled in the loft will be
surprising.
-Butter underworked will be striped,
overworked it has the appearance of
lard; if done either way there is a loss
in value and in the maker's reputation.
A good profit is the result of attending
to little details.
-In nearly all cases the nearer the
work of cultivation can be given in sea
son the better 9vill be the results se
cured. Thorough cultivation is one of
the essentials necessary to the growing
of a good crop.
-The man that will scrub his grain .
bins thoroughly withboiling brine just
before he ills them, will hardly be
troubled with weevil. WVhitewashing
the bins with thin whitewash, being
careful to get it into cracks snd corners,
makes assurance doubly sure.
-Some men set a tree as they would
a fence post, but such will never make
good fruit-growers. The ;hole ,for [the
tree should be nmade wide and deep,and
the bottom filled with good, rich earth.
Then set the tree firmly and put a
good stake beside it and bind a belt of
soft material about the tree and the
stake.
-The best time to plow stnbble
ground for fall wheat is the earliest
possible moment. If the roller or drag
follows close after jbe plow, the partly
crushed and presmbd down lumps will
not dry out eand harden as the3y
will if left as they eome from the plow,
and the work of preparing the seed
bed will be much easier; and then thH "
