(Continued from Page Seven.)
people, and this pretense of pleasant
ness is only put on for effect. Miser
able fraud, he is paid by the people
of Georgia to live high, dress up and
walk about for h’s health. He is paid
and fed well and the patients get no
benefit from his presence here, as any
right-minded man could see. The as
sistant physicians do the work.
Geo. T. Bell is a former Senator,
lawyer', actor, as well as an editor,
and to have held these positions he
must be a sensible man. I refer you
to him at Swainsboro, Ga., regarding
this ‘ 1 living inferno,” as he styles it.
I saw the great, high-headed Dr.
Jones one afternoon out on the lawn,
and 1 endeavored to find out from him
where would be a good place for me
to go when I got out of the asylum
for treatment for ray nerves. I
thought that he, being the head of this
institution, would be able to tell me
of some springs or mountains that
I could go to, but his time was too
valuable to be taken up in talking to
me more than three or four minutes.
His curt answer was, “Go to work —
just imagine you are well.” The
people of Georgia pay him between
$2,500 and $3,000 of their money per
annum to drive a pair of fine horses
to a carriage and ride around in an
automobile. All the doctors are fat
and sleek and the patients are sallow
and scrawny for the want of proper
nourishment. Geo. H. Bell says that
no man can hope to get away from
this hell without the sanction of the
persons placing him there, the mental
condition of the patient not being
considered.
Now, I have confined myself strictly
to speaking of the abuses of the male
department. I will endeavor to tell
yon something of the female wards.
During the latter part of 1908 some
male watchmen helped several female
patients to escape from the female
Convalescent —or somewhere over
there among the ladies —by cutting
the wire out of a window, and they
took them down in a basement of the
building and kept them there a week
or so, us I .ng them for immoral pur
poses, and they were found down in
Milled geville in a precarious condition,
having been abused by these men who
are hired to protect these poor un
fortunate people. These men were
tried in Milledgeville by a partial
jury and found not guilty, although
they were guilty. The female patients
say that they are treated very badly
and they say that their hair is nearly
pulled out by thp roots, and they are
also choked. Geo. Bell says that he
lived in this living inferno three years
—or rather, he did not die —he should
have said lie was not choked to death.
I really believe men have been killed
here. If an attendant killed a man
it would be a cinch to do so.
I understand from good authority
that the rule books read that if a
patient desires to lie down upon his
bed when feeling badly he is allowed
to do so and an attendant will
straighten it up, but patients are not
allowed to lie down unless very sick
and they must straighten up their own
beds, especially 'bps this apply to
Convalescents. Alex. Hawkins did not
allow me to lie on my bed when T was
very sick. There is also a'rule that
patients shall do no work immediately
after meals, and this is being openly
violated by all the halls, or was when
I left there.
©be 'Skffersonian
Dr. R. C. Swint admitted that this
was the rule, but Alex. Hawkins and
his assistant, Fleury, did not pay any
attention to what he said. The rules
should be pasted on the wall of each
hall so the patients could see them,
but this is not done and the patients
are not allowed to see the rule books.
(Jeo. H. Bell calls fhis place a
“stinkitorium,” but, gentlemen, I call
it a chokitorium. The lease system
of convicts went on for years before
it was investigated and was finally
stopped and I am praying to my
Maker that there will be a wider and
more thorough investigation of this
“choker-stinkertorium” than of the
former.
This cook Strowe at the Twin-build
ing had a crowd of negroes working
for him and patients who are sent
over to help him are cursed by these
negroes and are threatened violence
by them and this is the reason they
would not give me a job in the kitchen
because they thought I. would resent
the insults.

DEFINITION OF WIT.
Freemont, Mo., March 3, 1909.
Hon. Thomas Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir and Friend: I was interes
ted in your editorial on “Wit and Hu
mor” in a recent number of your
Magazine, and altho I am not great in
any way, yet I sometimes have an idea
of my own, and there it is in regard
to the definition of Wit and Humor:
Wit is dynamic or quick fun; Hu
mor is potential or slow fun. A
witticism is a thought giving an im
mediate idea of something funny.
The thought may be expressed or un
expressed. The quickness is what
gives the element of surprise.
Yours truly,
T. S. Frissell.
PARCELS POST GOOD FOR EV
ERYBODY BUT EXPRESS
COMPANIES.
My Dead Mr. Watson: 1 have just
read your editorial of Feb. 25, in The
Jeffersonian, entitled “Senator Bai
ley’s Strange Course.” It’s a good
one, and you should put it in your
Magazine.
The Parcels Post would be a great
benefit not only to the country people,
but it would be a great mo-ney saver
for all persons everywhere, except
those artificial persons entitled, “The
Express Companies.”
It is conceded that your article en
titled, “Judge Lawson’s Letter,”
puts ihim out of business.
Your work on the Geo. Bell case
has been appreciated by every one
who believes that right should tri
umph against wrong, and truth
against falsehood. Your a Imirer and
friend, E. S. Fuller.
