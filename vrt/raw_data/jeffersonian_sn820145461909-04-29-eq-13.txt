Our Post-Card Club
By Daddy Jim.
Out of the great pile of jokes and
funny stories that we have received,
most of them come from boys, and
many of them are well told and well
written. A few can not be consid
ered. A joke or a story which de
pends for its point on profanity, or
something that you would not like
to tell to your mother, is not good.
Its h-umor has become sour, mouldy,
rotten, decayed, evil-smelling. Above
all things, keep clean —your body and
your mind. You can not be healthy,
physically or mentally, unless you are
clean. Don’t be a “rotter.”
Now for the prizes.
First Prize for Girls.
Ruth Wilks, of Alexton, La., is
brief and to the point: “A little boy
was sitting behind a bald-headed man
at church, who was scratching the
fringe of hair on one side of his shiny
pate. The old gentleman kept it up
so long that at last the little boy be
came interested, and, leaning over,
said: i Say. mister, you ’ll never
catch him there. Why don’t you run
him out in the open?’ ”
First Prize for Boys.
This goes to Earle L. Bell, R. F. D.
1, Augusta, Ga. “A few years ago,
Pat and Mike, who had just arrived
in America, were walking barefooted
across a large field. Presently they
met a farmer with a stick in his hand,
and they asked him what he was car
rying it for. The farmer replied that
he carried it to kill snakes. Now
there are no snakes in Ireland, and
Pat and Mike wanted to know what
they looked like. The farmer told
them that they were things that
crawled on the ground and had a
body like a whip and a head like your
big toe. The Irishmen got sticks and
walked on until they came to a rail
fence. Pat told Mike to crawl over
first and see if he saw a snake. Mike
crawled over and looked, but did not
see a snake, so he told Pat to come
ahead. Pat put his foot in the crack
of the fence to climb over, and Mike,
seeing his toe, shouted, ‘Pat! Pat!
Wait, I see a snake!’ and drawing
back with all his force hit Pat’s toe
with his stick. Then Pat shouted,
‘Moike! Moike! Hit him again, I
say; he’s bitten me.’ ”
A Lazy Trick Trick.
Willie Hutcheson, R. F. D. 3, Tem
ple, Ga., sends a good one. Willie is
a girl, 13 years of age. “Once there
was a little boy resting in the shade
of a tree. A traveler came by and
asked him which road led to the city.
The boy never lifted his head, but just
pointed with his big toe. The traveler
said: ‘lf you will show me a lazier
trick than that, I’ll give you a quar
ter.’ ‘Put it in my pocket,’ said the
boy, and the traveler did it.”
The Cow and the Young Lady.
This comes from Brice Long, Lees
burg, Ala.: “Once there was an old
man, partially deaf, whose cow had
wandered from his premises, and he
could not find her. So he went to
church one Sunday, sought the
preacher, and requested him to an
nounce the mysterious departure of
his cow. After the service the
preacher first announced a wedding
that would occur the next Sunday,
intending to speak about the cow a
little later on. After lauding the
characteristics and abilities of the
young man he spoke of the bride-to
be, saying: ‘The young lady is one of
the most charming in town, and— ’
‘And you might say,’ interrupted the
owner of the cow, who had not heard
distinctly anything the preacher had
said, ‘that she is crumply-horned, and
has a great big knot on her back.’ ”
A Popular Story.
Eight of our members send in this
hunting story, so it must be a good
one. We select the version of Beman
Davis, Forney, Ala., because it is
shorter, and, we think, a little better
written than the others. “One day,
out hunting in Alabama, I sat down
on the bank of a river to rest, and in
a few minutes a flock of about 500
ducks came flying towards me. I
cocked my gun and took aim, but just
as I was about to pull the trigger I
saw some geese—about 5,000 of them
—coming in the other direction. So
I changed my mind and took aim at
the geese. Just then I caught sight
of a big rattlesnake, not three feet
away, and I thought the best thing to
do was to shoot the snake. I pulled
the trigger, and let go both barrels.
The gun burst. The right-hand bar
rel flew up the river and killed the
ducks; the left-hand barrel went
down the river and killed the geese;
the ramrod went down the snake’s
throat and choked him to death. The
stock flew back and knocked me over
in the river, and I came out with
both boots full of fish.” Beman is a
boy of fourteen.
Bobby and the Cat.
Beatrice Lackey, of Bodga, Miss.,
tells a short story that is good.
“Bobby had been asking a good many
questions, when his mother said:
‘Bobby, stop asking so many ques
tions; curiosity once killed a cat, you
know.’ Bobby was still for about
two minutes, when he asked: ‘Mam
ma, what was it the cat wanted to
know?’ ”

The Worst Joke.
We don’t think it’s quite right to
publish the worst joke. It might set
a bad example. But Daddy Jim will
send his prize, as he promised, and it
will be something good to read. So,
if you get a little book from the mail
carrier some day, you will know that
you made the worst joke.
Who Will Write?
“I have written to you all once
Jeffersonian
before, and will write again. My
school is out. I love to read the let
ters from the children, and would like
to correspond with some of them. I
am nine years old, and have five sis
ters and two brothers. I am the
youngest of all. Your little and ever
lasting friend, Clovie Gilstrap, Route
