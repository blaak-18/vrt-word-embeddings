Most Diseases Cause by Constipa
tion. Sewerage of the Brain
“It goes to the brain naturally, and
to every part of the body, every organ
being fed on this polluted blood, or
sewerage. It goes to your face in the
form of pimple-poison and creaks out
on the skin. It goes to your head and
gives you headache and dizziness, it
goes to your brain and makes you
drowsy, it weakens the stomach and
causes dyspepsia, and bad breath, it
goes to the liver and causes bilious
ness, it goes to the kidneys and even
tually gives rise to Bright’s Disease,
it goes to the heart and makes it
thump, it (goes to the eyes and they
lose their lustre, it makes your nerves
flabby and weak and out-of-sorts, and
this is the advance agent of all kinds
of disease, which you couldn’t get at all
if there was pure, rich, red blood flow
ing in your veins and your whole body
was in prime condition.”

we get the remedy. J. T. Wilbor, in
the June issue of the Magazine, gives
a good plan, I think. The Socialists
won t come to us on account of the
fuse deal with Democrats, and they,
and all of the other reform parties,
have not the remedy.
I am proud of the Omaha and
Ocala platforms; proud of the class
of people that got them up.
Oh, how stupid the people are that
they can’t give up party name and
■prejudice and demand their rights
at the ballot.
You have got the parsons some
what stirred up on the foreign mis
sion question. The hand is to the
plow, continue to run the furrow
straight, as you have done so far.
The- foreign missions article in June
issue of magazine is worth money to
a thinking man.
Respectfully,
R. M. HARRISON.
Lockesburg, Arkansas.
I am requested by a friend out in
Northwest Texas to answer some
questions he asks in a letter of re
cent date, which I shall endeavor to
do as briefly as possible:
Question 1. Who is it that is wag
ing war against Mr. Watson in regard
to this mission business? My answer
is this: Nearly two thousand years
ago there was a man called Jesus
who dared to stand up in the public
places and condemn the mighty
lords of the earth, self-righteous
Pharisees, hypocrites. These are
represented now by the Christian
gentlemen who are persecuting Mr.
Watson.
Question 2. Do you believe that
God’s smiles are resting on the
churches today as they have in by
gone years? No, God smiles on duty
well done. He tells us in Timothy,
chapter 5; 2, “But if any provide not
for his own, and especially for those
of his own house, he hath denied the
faith and is worse than an infidel.’’
Why do we cast the children’s bread
to the dogs? There are so many of
our own land and our own race who
would gladly receive the crumbs
which fall from the Master’s table.
I know whereof I speak. I have al
ways been among the poor and have
witnessed many sad, heartrending
scenes. I have been called from my
bed of repose, many times out in the
midnight winter’s chill, to close the
eyes of the dying, to comfort the or
phan children, or minister to the
wants of the afflicted. Today I see
Christ’s poor all over this land, the
poor whom He so many times re
quests His Church to care for, left
out in the cold. I see the hand of
the Church reaching out after the
riches of this world and saying, “If
you can’t pay, we can’t preach.”
They pass by the helpless little waif,
the Catholic comes, gathers in all
those little children and educates
them and maks Catholics of every
one. They are working slowly, but
surely; they sound no trumpets, they
blow no horns, but are well pleased
with their progress, and in a few
years the Catholics are going to do
with their ballots what they could
not do with their bayonets, and our
Protestant religion will bow to the
Pope of Rome. Some of our wise,
good men have seen the danger and
are trying to avert it, but will they
succeed? Yes, perhaps, with the
hand of God to guide.
Jeffersonian
The poor laboring people are rapid
ly leaving the churches. What does
it mean? In my childhood days I
was nursed in the lap of Methodism.
I have always had a deep, undying
love for the Church, and how it
grieves my heart and troubles my
soul to see her proud banner trail in
the mire of greed and graft. Yes, I
have gloried in her mighty works;
now I must sorrow at her downfall:
I have gathered thorns with every
rose; I have- suffered sorrow with
every joy.
One more question to answer, and
I am through. Would John Wesley
know his Church were he to return
to earth today? No, the proud
beauty has disowned her father, and
is walking in the way of the ungodly.

JEFFERSONIANS A FORCE IN
EDUCATING MASSES.
Dear Friend: Enclosed find
money order for $2.00, for which
please send your weekly Jeffersonian
and Jeffersonian Magazine for one
year to A. W. Johnston, Stillmore,
Ga., and send two of your premium
pocket knives to same address, as
per your offer in the Jeffersonian. I
wish I could send one hundred sub
scribers for these papers, as I believe
they are doing more good toward
educating the people to the rotten
condition of our politics than all
other forces combined. I have been
a close reader of everything you have
written since the speech at the com
mencement exercises at Milledgeville
was published some eighteen years
ago. This speech was read to us in
school at Williams Creek church, in
Warren county, by Mr. Hugh Ware,
who was the principal of this school
at that time, and I think the speech
was read from the Atlanta Constitu
tion.
Your articles on Foreign Missions
have been enjoyed very much by me,
although I am a Missionary Baptist
(as I believe you are). I hope you
will continue to give the facts so that
the people may know where their
money is going.
I am opposed to any kind of tariff,
and in favor of postal savings banks
and Government money, for it seems
that when they get the “Tariff re
vised” this time it will be almost im
possible for the working man to
make enough to live on.
With best wishes I am
Your sincere friend,
W. P. DOZIER.

Catarrh is not only dangerous, but it
causes bad breath, ulceration, death
and decay of bones, loss of thinking
and reasoning power, kills ambition
and energy, often causes loss of appe
tite, indigestion, dyspepsia, raw throat
and reaches to general debility, idiocy
and insanity. It needs attention at
once. Cure it with Gauss’ Catarrh
Cure. It is a quick, radical, permanent
cure, because it rids the system of the
m i son germs that cause catarrh.
In order to prove to all who are suf
fering from this dangerous and loath
some disease that Gauss’ Catarrh Cure
will actually cure any case of catarrh
quickly, no matter how long standing
