Populists may be office-seekers,
but a Democrat is "oblesged" to
have one. There are very few u
Democrats in this perish who are a
not candidates for offices, either
appointive or elective.
Cleveland is the great champion a
of our public credit. He calls in t(
partners Belmont, Morgan and tl
Rothschild, to "foat" some more tl
bonds every time said public cred- .1
it gets below par with said Wall- T
streeters, Belmont, Morgan, etc. w
This saving of our public credit by a
floating more bonds is always done t
by our savior Cleveland, just after I
he sobers up from one of his duck a
hunts, and it is one of the reasons tx
why we wash he would stay drunk Y
all the time. i

i DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES
No Place for Popullts.
In the great sham battle among
- the Democrats over the Lottery
in 1892, the said Democrats in
their eagerness to whip each other,
begged and persuaded, and partial
ly succeed in inducing, men of all
other political parties to go into
b their primaries and vote. Ever
since that time this practice has
been kept up, and people who do
not believe with the Democrats and
do not expect to vote with them on
election day have been prevailed
upon to participate in their pri
maries.
This is a very appropriate thing
for the Democrats to do, because
their party is an aggregation of
political nonderscripts. If a Dem
ocrat in these days is anything at
all, he is everything. In that party
you will find high tariff men and
low tariff men, goldbugs, Piver
bugs and greenbackers, lottery and
anti-lottery, prohibitionists and
anti's, single taxers and double
taxers, Republicans, Populists and
Democrats-a heterogenerous mass
led by ballot-box stuffers and bull
dozers-a cosmopolitan conglomer
ation.
The Democratic party, therefore,
" is not hurt by this indiscriminate
participation of members of other
parties in its primaries. It is
rather benefitted by the addition
of a pure element even though
temporarily; and it is not there
fore in the interest of said Demo
cratic party that we would warn
the Populists and Republicans of
the danger, but in the interest of
the individuals themselves.
Of course men may vote in a
Democratic primary and after
wards get converted-see the light
-and vote a different ticket on
election day; but for a man-A
MAN-to belong to one party and
deliberately go into the councils of
another and participate in its le
gitimate work, knowing that he
will not abide by it, but expects to
support another ticket, that man
is engaged in a very little business,
and will soon forfeit the confidence
and respect of his friends in all
parties.
Populists therefore should keep
out of the Democratic primaries
to-morrow. It is no place for
them. Theb rules laid down by
the Democratic managers forbid
anyone but straight Democrats.
They tell you that you are not
wanted and you should be men
enough to stay away in spite of
their persuasions on election day.
You may have a friend in the Dem
ocratic party whom you would like
to assist, but do you know that
you will be doing that friend an
injustice by pushing him out as
the nominee of the Democratic
party to waste his time and money
in a fruhitls effort to win the of-,
See I
The baest thing you can do for
your friend is to advise him to,
join i. witb the People and help
them in their aght for their rights
if he expeets them to do anything
for him.
The People's party carried this
perish by 500 white majority and
have gained many supporters since,
and what Is the use of wasting~ i
time trying to make agood ticket 1
for it to beat next April !
Doe't do it.
Stray out of the Democratic pri
mariee.

one that is growing.

OUR STATZ TICKET.
Before this i.suo of our paper
reaches its readers the Populist
State Convention will have met at
Y Alexandria, and named our ticket.
This will be the largest and most
representative convention the Peo
P1 ple's party have ever held in this
State.
That there will he a strong con
servative Populist ticket named,
there is no doubt.
The Democratic press has been
teeming with telegraphic and edi
torial assurances that a Republi
can combine had been effected by
which we would name practically
a Republican ticket, and the Dem
ocratic politicians and office-seek
ers have been praying that it
should be done, but if they ever
believed that their predictions were
true, they will be gloriously dis
I appointed when our ticket is named.
The Republicans have promised
to vote our ticket, in the hope of
defeating the sufferago amendment
and securing fair elections, but if
I they have ever hoped to name the
most important places on our tick
. et, they have much mistaken the
men with whom they are dealing.
The ticket will be a surprise tb
both the Democrats and the Re
publicans, but we believe it will
be satisfactory not only to the Re
publicans, but to all the opposition
to the "machine ticket" that is al
ready in the field
This Populist ticket will be
placed on a short, yet decisive plat
form made up of State issues from a
Populist standpoint, and the Oma
ha platform will be indorsed as is
usual in Populist State Conven
tions.
Every indication goes to show
that there never has been such a
splendid chance for Populists to
win in this State, and the ticket and
platform will be one of which eve
ry Populist will be proud, and one
that will command the respeet and
support of a large element in both
the old parties, and we should now
begin to take off our coats, roll up
our sleeves and get ready to make
the fight of our lives for liberty.
We notice that two of the can
didates for Representatives on the
Democratic ticket in this parish
declare in their announcements
that they will support, aml do all
in their power to elect Newton C.
Blanchard to the United States
Senate.
We presume this will help them
a great deal in their canvass for
votes in this parish.
We can understand why the
railroads should want Mr. B. re
turned to the United States Senate,
after his brilliant services to them
in perfecting their titles to a big:
slice of the peoples' homes.
We can understand why the Le
vee Boards, Engineers, Contract
ors and river commissionera should '
favor Mr. B.'s return to the U. S.
Senate.
We can understand why the
woldbugs, who were enabled to
carry the Democratic party in this
State by the "keep-it-out-of-State
politics" policy of Mr. Blanchard,
should support him for re-election.
But why men who pay the prof
its on Railroading and lost their
lands by them; why men who pay
the Levee taxes and get their lands I
washed away by the "all-levee sys- i
temrn; why the honest, earnest free
silver men who weast and eed free I
silver because it will make money t
cheaper and their labor and pro
ducts higher; why all these people
who are great ma~s of the people I
of Louisian, should want Mr. a
Blanchard returned to the U. S.
Senate, is more than we can under- t
stand.
The Comingr Nation contans mno
advertlisemcnts, is a larger paper a
than this mse and is warranted to I
make Popullbsts out of every one l
who hu anything left in his crn- iL
armtohbild to. That paper and

What do the people amount to

i Who cares for the people ? Who
herds their wishes, consults their
y interests, or listens to their pro

Another year rolls m upon us
and we can, if we will, make it
memorable with our strutggle for
good government.
We owe it to ourselves, to our
"forefathers, and to our children,
we owe it to all that makes life
worth living-to put an end to this
intolerable misrule.
Let us begin the year with re
newed energy, quickened resolu
tion, revived enthusiasm.
Don't get down hearted.
No man is whipped as long as
he will fight. Do your full duty,
and be patient yet a little while.
Unless all signs fail, this sys
tom of misrule, of ballot box stuf
afing, of ward-heeler triumph, is
on its last legs.
You can't afford to lot your eno
inoes crow over you-making inso
lent brag of the success with which
they eca cheat you out of your
ballots I
You can't allord not to continue
to fight the outrage until you have
exhausted every possible method
of getting your rights.
You hav'nt exhansed them all
yet.-T. E. Watson.
