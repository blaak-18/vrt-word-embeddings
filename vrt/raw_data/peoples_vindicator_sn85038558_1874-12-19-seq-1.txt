Our Railroads. j
There are three great lines of rail
way projected from New Orleaus, on
the'west side of the Mississippt river.
One of these is to Houston, Texas,
and'is already completed to Bayou
Goula, its point of departure from
that river, with half the additional
grading finished to Houston. Anoth
er, known as the Lonisliinn Central
Ilailway, is to connect Yerniillionville,
on the Houston line, with the city of
Shreveport, running through the Ope
lousas couptry and the Red River val
ley. These two are controlled by
organized companies, and the incor
porators are now devising meanls for
their early completion. The third is
the projected line from New Orleans
to D)allas, Texas, tapping there. the
great Texas and Pacific Railway ; tind
this road, though in its incipiency,
and without a charter as yet, seems
to be received with very decided fia
vor by local capitalists.
• These three roads are to form the
maiu trunk lines for the great railway
system leading from our chief coni
mhrcial city to the west anid north
west, and would be sufficient, if btilt,
to regain tQo trade which has recent
ly been diverted to St. Louis and. the
Gulf coast) of Texas.
In this system, the N, 0. and HIous
ton road is,the first vital iecessity, and
should be finished at once, as the ba
sis of the other two. Tile Louisiana
Central will connect with it at 'Ver
amillionville: The routes of. both
these roads have been selected .with
judguignt, ard no modificmtito should
be made in that respect., T'ie affairs,
also, Vf the two comnanmies seem to be
in good hands at piesent, and Ate
people and c'apitalists should respond
liberally. with whatever encourage
ment may ;be necessary.
The route of the Dallas road, though
undefined, seem to lie indicated fromn
Opelousas or Vermillionville to the
city of Dallas. An examination of
the map will show this selection to
be injudicious. If I)allis is to be the
objective point, the divergence should
not be so far south. Tile route is too
long, and traverses a comparatively
barren portion of the territory of Lou
isiana and Texos. It leares the great
heart of central Texas almost untouch
ed. It will be more a competitor to
the La. Central and the Texas and
Pacific (east of Dallas) than an inde
pendent tributary line., .It will find
its through trade very nearly the same
as that of the other, two great routes,
and its meagre way business will be
exclusively ip freights and travel
which now reach New Orleans by
overland and water communication
already established. Dallas, in' fact,
is not the best terminus, nor Opelou
sas the mosti avaiiablle initial point
for suclh a road. After the conipletiona
of the IIouston road and tihe Louisiana
Central rail way is assured, tlie other
line in the system should peiinetrate
the vast central region of Texas, mond
Sform a great trunk line, running east
and west through that Stirte, mnidway
between the Texas and Pacific on tlle
northi and the: Houston road on. :the
south. It should leave tihe La. Celi
trail at or near htehitoches, triveis
Sing the saltabrie. and fertile "red
lands" of Sabine, uSan Augustine,
Nacogdoches, Cherokee and Anuderson
coudties, crossing the Interuatinial
and thie Great Northern roads at.theirl
junction at faehtine-tbence wet,
through tih stiill more iertile an~d
equally beaitifui "timbred prai riesi
of Freestone and Linmestone counties,
crossing the Texas eontrat,a t MeiaI
-theuce west, througl stil riche6r
lands to aco, on th. azose , form
ing its future junmton ywith the Teias
and Pacsic } y tlip, projected sVaeo
anud Northweetern rate, at abolut 150
miles w~est of Dallad s.
SThere is noegrteftheSouth more
eharmin than that Whidh -lies: along
this route;, BeIau~iful to the eye,' and
"watered, by li4dig 'sptrings,"n its in-.
trionsic 4alue asafarming and graziug
region is a. hundred times-. greater
than the wwiole sLtreteh .of conoti~y
bordering on the proposed linei from
.0pelousas to Dallas,: and. a thousand
fold more so thanu the lrren lands on
theTexasi and Pacifl for 150 imiles
,west of Shreveport. It is alrieady
wiell settled by an enterpiistig, intel.
Sligent and thrifty people, and is.ea.
pable of sustaining a dense polIlia- l
tion. The way business would be
very considerable at the outset, as
the road would furnish the only avail
able outlet for traffic and travel now
"locked in" for want of railroads and (
pavigable rivers, besides opening upi
an immense lumber trade furnished
by the superb and inexhautible pine I
forests which skirt the line through
out Ena:'tern Texas.
The route from . Natchitoches to
Waco is only three hundred miles, or I
two thirds the length of that from º
Opelousas to Dallas. It taps the In
ternational, the Great Northern and
the Central roads before reaching the i
Texas and Pacific-it passes centrally 1
through two parishes in Louisiana,
and eight populous and wealthy coun
ties in Texas, from which "local aid"
might be received-it traverses the
most beautiful country in America ;
and, not least, it wouhl form the great
central stem of the Texas system,
from which feeders would radiate,
tapping a vast region naturally tribu
tary to New Orleaus, but not touched
by any road now in contemnplatibn.
Puhrther, it would require only the
building otf a short line from Natchi
toches to Monroe, La., a distance of
80 miles,'to make 'coihnectiou with all
the eastern roads, by way of Vicks
burg a'd Jackson, M!iss., and at the
same tine penietrate a large interior
piiition" of our owniState, besides es
tabilishing nuclh needed coammunica.
tion between the Ouachita and lied
irver vallies.
Thie: riter of this' article has trayv
ersed oil 'horseback ' the whole scope
of country embraced in the system of
railroads propioed, ind knows where
of he speaks by personal observatiou.
Hi' i4~sittisfied that his modifica-'
tions of the systemn contemn plated are
more practicable, and would result in
greaterfbedeflt toi New Orleans than
the origiuna idea of a direct road to
Dallas, aid hopes that the papers of
that city will present his views to
their readers. P.

There is no doubt of the election of
Moncure, four ConglessmenI, and a
mlajority of the ,Legislature.
This is a flact so well establiishedie
that no Returllilng Boarlld can alter the
decree, aiid the people who hiive ol
tained this signal vietory have resolv- I
ed to enjoy the full' benefits of their
triumpnih at tlhe polls.
The delay is occasioning uneasi
ness and dissatisfaction in tile city,
and the people demand to knlow tihe
finial result of the electionii. Let thei
board lshow sonslu respect anal consid

Kettle at oncel the .qluestilns involved

Our visitors from the States of tilhe
Union. who are now il lIrge nuimbers'

ill Louisiana is still unknown, when
in their own States the 'counts have
