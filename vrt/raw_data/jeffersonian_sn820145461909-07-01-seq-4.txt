It is not often that the brutal class

der of Miss Elsie Sigel in New York
last week points such a warning fin
ger that the press would be derelict
in its duty if it did not give the widest
publicity to the facts which, as at
present developed, seem to *be that
(his young girl, through misdirected
religious zeal, became the victim of
Oriental depravity. There is no doubt
that the American public has already
fixed the responsibility for this crime
upon the abhorrent and perverted
idea that placing refined young white
women upon terms of social equality
with the scum of the Orient is a
means of grace. How it is that men
and women who, presumably, would
object to their daughters mixing in
discriminately with young white men,
can encourage them to lower them
selves to the level of the degenerate,
filthy “washee-washees” and “slum
gullion” slingers in cheap restaurants
is only to be explained on the idea
that anything in the name of religion
will go with some unspeakable bigots
and missionary fanatics.
Distressing as is the end of Miss
Sigel, the poor girl will not have died
in vain if such death has been the
means of bringing about a wholesome
sentiment against Oriental invasion
’ and the mixing of alien blood with
that of our own people.
It is said that, when these New
York missions were first estab
lished, the unnatural union of a Chi
naman and one of the girl mission
aries occasioned much comment; but
“afterwards such marriages became
so frequent they attracted no atten
tion.” How HORRIBLE! Is it not
time we held America for the Cau
casian race? Everything which fa
vors in anywise social equality with
the yellow, black, brown and motley
colored with which we are cursed
should be frowned down upon. And
in the class of things to be tabooed
is the social recognition of such
“Chinks” as one Baron Uriu and wife
who have recently been dined and
wined and feted by the fatuous offi
cials of this land and many private
citizens of as little judgment. Is the
portfolio of any saddled-colored up
start from any corner of the globe
to be the signal for America to kow
tow and thus give the signal for All-
Sin, Ching Lee, Pomp and Dinah to
bop on to the social equality band
wagon? Can't the male officials
manage to transact the necessary dip
‘ lornatic business with the black and
brown and yellow men and show the
white American public the respect of
not having these people flaunted as
desirable guests at society functions?
The South and West should unite
against Eastern and Northern fanati
cism that virtually demands social
amalgamation at the sacrifice* of the
white woman. Her degradation is
the condition precedent to the hybrid
ancj mongrel throng they desire to
matt* of our coming generations.
It is with sincere sorrow we have
to note the death of another promt-

“Whereas, We, the Protestant
Episcopal Church, in the diocese of
Lexington, State of Kentucky, being a
branch of God's Church and assem
bled in court, feel deep concern over
conditions created and being perpe
trated by alarming, if not revolution
ary, legislation, whereby the necessa
ries of the lives of the needy are dis
proportionately taxed; and whereas,
such legislation is fast destroying
men’s reverence for law and so tend
ing to anarchy;
“Therefore, We, members of the
council aforesaid, conscious of the
trust of righteousness, committed by
the triune God, do plead with all con
structing and controlling forces of
(3be Jeffersonian
tariff agitation. The
Episcopal Diocesan
council of Lexington,
our land —senatorial, congressional,
legislative and executive —to give us
laws right in the sight of God, just
and true to all the people, and we call
upon every Christian organization in
the land to join us in this purpose
and pleading.”
When one thinks that this nation
boasts itself Christian and that every
Sunday millions of citizens dutifully
trot to church to hear things of right
eousness it is pathetic that this
church is the only one which has
thus far interposed its voice in behalf
of the nation’s welfare. With par
tisan politics a church has nothing
to do, but with the framing of tariff
legislation, presumably an economic
measure, all citizens and organiza
tions have a legitimate voice.
While the Senate is completely im
pervious to all moral suasion, a mon
ster petition such as could be sent
from the churches without regard of
political affiliation or denominational
differences would have a tremendous
effect.
J. F. Harms, after serving a year
and a half as meat inspector in the
East St. Louis pack
“Packingtown.” inghouses, has re
signed his position in
disgust. He asserts that the inspec
tors in charge of the Bureau of Ani-
H Torn Dolan
mal Industry were too lenient with
the packers and that the words “The
United States Inspected and Passed”
on the products of the packinghouses
were meaningless. A portion of his
letter to Secretary Wilson is as fol
lows:
“The inspection at the National
Stock Yards, Illinois, is costing the
people approximately SIOO,OOO a
year, and it is not actually worth $1
to' them. For when the word is
passed from the inspector in charge
to the inspectors actually doing the
work on the floors that they are get
ting too many condemned animals
and to change the grading, it means
that the whole thing is a farce. Mr. .
Secretary, the packers are getting to
day from 70 to 80 per cent, of what
ought to be condemned and destroyed.
“I have seen from 1,200 to 1,500
pounds of lard spill and run into an
open sewer in the floor, the sewer
outlet quickly blocked and said lard
taken up from the floor and out of the
sewer, both of which were unclean
and unsanitary. And your doctors
passed same to the packers over the
protest of the Inspector on that
floor, and it went to the public
marked ‘United States inspected and.
passed.’
“I have seen animals in a dying
condition dragged into the killing
beds and marked ‘U. S. Inspected and
Passed.’ Some of the filthiest things
imaginable are practiced in the sau
sage departments.
“These are all permitted by those
in charge. In an inspector calls their
attention to any of the wrong he is
told, as I was, that the people who
eat such stuff are too lazy to prepare
anything for themselves and ought to
have such stuff.”
Evidently the horrifying revela
tions as to the Chicago packinghouses
are to be duplicated. It is a very
easy matter for officials to wink at the
packers, and carcasses that have been
thrown out as unfit, it is claimed
by the men who work in the pack
inghouses, are afterwards simply
dragged back again and utilized. Os
course, honest inspection would pre
vent such things, and penitentiary
sentences for these filthy criminals
would in a measure satisfy the de
mands of justice, although the mur
ders done through palming off spoil
ed, diseased meats can never be
known and hanging a few of the pack
ers would not be too bad for them.
But a little bribe, judiciously be
stowed here and there, evidently suf
fices to obtain the coveted label “In
spected by the U. S. and Passed.”
