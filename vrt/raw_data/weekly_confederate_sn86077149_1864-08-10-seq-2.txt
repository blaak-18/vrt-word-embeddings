THE CONFEDERATE. (
WFJIXKSDIY, AUGUST 10, 1864.
The Erection Returns.
We give this'morriug all the election re
turns that have been received. The majority
far Governor Var.ce is unprecedented, and
wht'ii definitely ascertained,' must strike every
true man wiih the highest gratification not
a a party triumph, but as a thorough vinli
ration of the patrio'ism and loyalty of the
people -of Carolina. Toe entire ur.anicdty
with which they h tvo rebuked tr -ason, dis
Inaity and the enemies of the Southern cause
and the Confcd. -rate Government, under fc'.l
their tsvumI and manifold sh-ides and typ',
will ensure harmony atd concord among our
own people, and e&tablisli fcr theS'ivte abroad,
a reputati;i to which she bos all along been
entitled, but which a fefr designing and c -r-fipt

for being among ti e truest, mo.-t sincere a.-:d

We have received the returns from but few
counties in the election for members cf the
Legislature. Such a ws have will be found
under th appropriate head.' But few Holden

Indeed, that aim of his service seems prttty
well broken up and dispersed. To crown tho
glory of our victory, the famous Gan. Stane

beon vanquished, himself and five hundred of

mainder dispersed and fleeing for their lives.
A private telegram received here says Stone

The raorning begins to break.
The Lfgislatnre.
So far as heard from, the only Holdenlte
eandidates elect to the Legislature are as fol
lows: One Senator and two Commoners from
Johnston; nc Senator ai d two CoEimoners from
Dividfcon; oire CoinojoDer frm Greene, two
Coin i oners frcm Itaudclph one Senator and
three Ccmmoaers froBi Gniiford; aad one Sen
,atr and two Commoners from Wake making
16 in all. Tfce three from TYake county stand
a good chance of being defeated when the
whole array vote is in, and it is believed tuch
will te the ca-i'e with some of the Guilford
aen. Moore and Montgomery may probably
ach send a Holden Commoner and perhaps
cueor two other counties but it is not be
lieved tkwt there will b xeediug 20 or 25
Iloldeaites arang the 170 ccniposiug the two

' Atd tie election of even these fejr, aftjprds
evidence of tbe- repugnance to Mr. Hldea
ataosg the people; for nearly all of those counties
that have returned his friends to the Legisla
ture, have given tupritie sgaii st him ; thus
showing that peronal pnpnlarity. local cirenra
st&nces or extraordinary eff-rt." have iaunced
Vauce raeu t cast their vote fer personal
favsritef, although opposed to tbe:n in the
great, Ki5iu iteue trc Cubmaoiial election.
Wc therefore regard the election of Holden
ruea:bers from ccuut'os that tave Vance a'rua
jaiity, as no triumph for biia or his c-tu.se,
whatever; !ut ?s &u i'dJiticr.al testimonial cf
the all buf unanimous condensation of the
people upon him and his course. Fifty thou
sand out cf the probably sixty thousand votes
that have been east for Governor, have so da
e'.nrid it.

ShcrmaiL's Loss.
With that u:jbls'-is:g f firontery clvaracter
iK'ic of the man, SbpTn-'o has added another
falsehood to the long list he has already made,
since his military caner io this war commenc
ed. He r-.-ports t the Federal Government
that his loss in the Ufe battle was' only two
I firusand. while he eui mates the Confe lcra?e
loss scvn thousand. Over two thousand cf l is
j men were captured by our forces and have
t.be sent to Macon. This alone wcuM expose
his falsehood, but says ; he Macon TrlegrapJi,
1st us look into a fvw facts. Ail accounts of
! general ;tficers unite in saying "jtbat not lest
! ban tw( th uiand five hundred Federals w.re
i
! killed outright in the engagement this wculd
i
j make his,weur.de-.i nrmber taking the geuer
J al ratio as correct over ten thousand men.
J Unite the whole and we have a total of fully
fiflewn thousand a his loss iu the battle of
last Friday evening. So far as our loss is
concerned, it msy be seven thousand altogeth,
er, but nf one thing we are ceitain, the ene
my 's Ios exceeded our3 tally one hundred
per cent. We do not blieve that Sherman's
Jyiug report can deceive the Yankees, di-ludvd
as they are Ky the war fanatices of the North.

Seditions language.
We are an advocate of the freedom of
speech, bit we are opposed to its licentious
nes -w.x-fe parttcnlarly are we opposed to
the langu$e of sedition. The freedom or
lilierfy of speech is a chartered right, and can
not' be infringed without individual wrong
and a violation; of th- Cnstitntion. Lieen
tionsness of speech is "excessive freedom" it is
cot the use, but the abuse, of the freedom -of
speech. . Sedition is defined to be "An offense,
! not capital, and not anVrantiPg to treason
j agsinl the government of a conntry, consis
I tkg iu disturhiog the tranqui'tlj of the Sate,
i or excim g discontent against the .Govern
j meat, by meeiings, speeches, publications'
1 fcc. A' V oi:e. therefore who disturbs the
j tranquility of the government, in either of the
above modes, is guilty, of 7ditio.
We know that the Editors of the Standard
ard Progress l ave been . gnilty of seditions
publication?, in a number cf jnstsrees, and
thus rendered themselves amenable to the law.
But the policy of the government is very
wi-eW tbat of forbearance, and they have
been allowed to malse their seditious pubiioa
iious with impunity. We do not. say .the
Dvemueni has acted iir,vi?eb in this ma t
ter ;' because, "'he go-I seme ami patriotism of
th'; people ha.o generally ccrr feted ..theso hu
by th-, n oia! fbrct of election. The agi
tatwrjs.have beeu rebuked 'ar.d phiceu under
the ban -f public scorn and 'indignation, as
IloUleu :ind Peunhiton have boep by .tho
I popular voice, declared ua the 28'b Juiy iu
the army, and re-affirmed, a? d lat-ficd by the
citizen population' on the th insiant. They
were flarered with 'the beli-f that they were
lesiding the people for their own saltish and
unworthy, purposes, when, io fact, as the re
sult has s'hown, they were drixing the people
from them. '
We hardly think they .will be guilty of at
tempting aain to "disturb the tranquility of
the Statu " by arraying the people against the
government. Tf.cy may betrayed in:o say
ing fooli.'h, silly things, wdthing, ath- y are,
J rder tin? stin-r o'an overwhelming defeat.
But they will soon cool off, and be brought,
s we hope, to their senses.

they are much better, much more Jreo from

We will make one remark in this connection :
We have no confidence in the loyaby or the
patriotism of any one who would u?e or en
dorse Mich laniuagy as that employed by the
Secretary of State.
The above is from the Conxeivaiife cf this
city ; and in the absence of an editorial of our
own, we copy onr neighbor's, and submit the
question to the people of the State what
oQght to be doe with such a man ?

Cbritably disposed persons, resuieut iu the
State ef North Carolina and other States, can
do an incalculable amount ef good, by con
tributing to the wants of the poor now encamp-
j ed around the city of Petersburg, driven from
their home aad cat off frtn supplies by tke
uepreeedentei and inhuman warfare cead acted
by onr terrible foe. The mention pf this pr
position will bestir the generous and sympa
thetic throughout the cou&try. The Riilrtads
and Exprees Companies will doubtless trans
port any contribution direct to W. W. Townes,
Maf0r of the City, for the poor, gratis, in tbt
way ef food and clothing. And contributions
in money directed either to P. f Petcud, Es ,
r the Sitnk of the City of Petersburg, now
located at Ralegh, or to R Raglany, Esq , at
Pettreborg, will have the proper disposition.
It is hoped that committee will be appointed
at different places to aid in this relief for a
ufforing people, and that Editors generally will
call attention to the subject.

yaiiich was gallantly respoudrd to by bis brig
ade, and we think another charge was tnado
o the ether side of tbe field at the same time.
The enemy were completely routed and farced
back. Our line was then formed ou tho ad
vanced position two miles farther this way.
Geo Stot.eman ?c stained a heavy h ss in this
defeit, ard as soon as he saw preparations
making to charge him aain, be dispatcned a
white Hag propping an utdiortiuoual syr ren
der of bis whole force. The flag was received
by Col. Crews, who then con I rooted him with
182 men.
As soon as Stoncman saw the 182 man to
v. born be h. surrendered, be sat down and
took a regular cry. He handed hi sword
over to Co'. Ci-ws, and hi St iff directly di-
vested themselves of their arms'.
