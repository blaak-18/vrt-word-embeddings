A good iamn and a good cit izen

connmmitted suicide. No reaulson:lal
cause could be given for the r:ash
act, until finally a paper was found
under his hat which read thus :
"I was a widower ; I married a
widow with a grown ldaughter; my
father visited us and fell in love
with my step-daughter and married
her, andl conseluently he became
my son-in-law and my stepl-tlau_.,ht
er became my mother. later my
wife bore me a son. who under the
circumstances became mny father's
brother-in-law and my own uncle
on account of being a brother to
te my step-daughter. My step-daugh
ter also gave birth to a son, who
s was certainly my brother and at
the same time my grandson. lMy
own wife through all this was my
grandmother. I was at thre same
time my wife's huslmand ani grand
child, andl in con-sequence the hus
band of anyone's grandniother
must ire his grandfather. I blecamo

more than I could possibly bear."
