In theMorning.
"In the mnornhg," she said, look
inlg away frolm ace which sought
hieis with a glaice persistent, qules
tionlilng. "I cannot dlecide to-night.
ill the miorniit, I will give illy an
'V"Why not tonight?" he asked, in
II reply. "I hayve heard, Miss North,
that your ideasarce pieculiar, roman,
tic. Your acts are original and de
L, cided ; you do lot believe ill walking
in the same olI path in which your
r- mother and gtunindmother trod before
you.,,
"True ;. bult I usually please mny
self, 11Mr. 'l'hnrtle. Therefore. nity
only answer taw is-in the imorning."
The moonl shone brightly upon her,
and sithe was 'ery white to-night.
Miss NoSth seldeni betrayed any nor
vous emnotion ftore- people. She
was cool and sel -.eliant, rarely losing
her self poise. llt now the slender
ringed fingers ef her fair shapely
hand thrembled ai triile :as they closed
tightly over her iintly-carved ivory
lan ; and she fluttered it a little Iut
steadily, though lie breeze came
strong and sweet from the garden
below.
A blush seemed to come over themn
for the space of a Unoltnent.
She waited, thiiking he might anll
swer, and drew back a trille, leaning
her head against tl fringed cypress
sprays that cling to the pillars of the
portico.
º He earnestly scanned her proud
d contour and ligure, for lie had met
them for the tirst tinle that day ; antid
i he had not yet becone familiar with
the shade of the liglhtbrown Iair, inor
the chaiging lights ind shadows of
her orbs.
They lnad been defaut, then fright
Sened ; now they tveres cold, and now
tender, and at last they grew tired
and wistful. Yet, with all these
changes, they lever lost their honest
eypltressioin, but looked like great
child eyes set in a womnam's thought
ful countenance.
And as hlle watched her, his hlleart
yearned towards her, as it had never
before done for woman's love.
"Miss North !" lhe sail ; and theni
lie paused a moment, seemling to
study her thonghts
Flor aniswer, she looked up qlues..
tioningly and her weary look was
more decided now.
Ada !" lie said, again, more softly;
anid aits hlie spoke her amle, ait flush
crelit over her cheeks, aid she droop
ed her head. f
"If you would only say 'yes' to
night!" lie pleaded, and diere was a'
soft light ill his eyes. "I love you I
just as dearly as though I had known t
you for years. You iare miy sister's t
dearest fliiend, andi you are almtost as s
famniliar with my chalacter and ways c
as though you were acquainted withl
ue a lifctimte. Mary would be de- t
lighted, and any piarnts iltasedl, also.
You have no near friends to consult. t
Say "yes' now, and if mry love and a
devotion caln repay you, you shall 4
never regret giving your assent. And t
it will be so fond it recollection for 1,
me to remember hereafter, that Ii
asked you to be my wife the first
evening I ever met you, and you had I'
faith enough to trust mue and promise." li
He was very manly and tender in I
his glance, and his smile loving and .
persuasive ; and Ada could not mieet Ii
them anmoved. She turned away t
suddenly, and looked steadily out to
wards the sky.
A slight shiver passed over her
frame, and shie moved, as If to leave I
him. I
"The dew is falling," shie said, a
seeming unabule to friamle, any othler
excuse, in her con;fusiou, for going ,
into the hIouse.
"Yes," lie answered, taking her a
hIand, and smiling. "It is fallinig in
your eyes, miy darling." Y
Dl)on't i" sihe said, with a half-sob
that touched himi, and looking brave- d
ly up, though her tears flowed. "In n
the nmorning I will tell you-and tell s
you, too, why could I not answer you
to night."
"Inu thie mornig, then,"he answered v
touching his lips lightly but tenderly r
to the hand he held within his own. t
Sihe turned quickly; and lie hieard
her light swift footsteps ascending the
staircase and along the passage, tihe c
slight rustle of a train it their wake.
The door of her room opened and c
closed; the key, with a decided click, r
shot the bolt in its' plge, and he 1
beard no more, a
Then lie walked down into the v
garden, rather restlessly, wondering I
within himself if he had not been at
shade too rash, and feeling a slight
sense of relief, if the truth were told t
that she had reserved her answer.
He was wonderfully interested in a
her, certainly. For more thau a year, I
her praises had sounded in his ears, e
rang with constant changes, by the a
voice of his sister Mary,. lie had not s
thouglht to like her; and when lihe
had troubled himself to think of the t
subject at all, it was another woman o
be pictured ; stately, strbong-minded, a
self-satisfied, and disagreeable in the
extreme.
Without wealth, she hind maintain
ed a prominiuent place in fashionable a
circles, Ihe had been told. And with- d
out brains, hie argued, she had palm- 1
ed herselfofffor a woman who was t
both lovable and wise. lot the best
logic in the world; but, to be candid i1
it was only his dirst Impression.io the e
matter, and he had not taken the
trouble to think upon the subject at c
all.
So, wheu lie met her next day, at hI
the ihouse of a friend, where she was c
spending the summer with his dster,
his first sensations were of surprise
then pleasure. a
A self-poised, graceful girl bowed a
politely to a tall, handsomae man, and
then, as though it were an after
thought, quoietly put out her hand to t
him. i
lie forgot to view her critically, as
he ntinuded to do. Aftelwards, when I
his siter came to consult her about~
some trifle in the way of dress, hel
remlll ber e his intention, h1it some
how, it did not seem aln easy thing to
Sdo.
A well-titting white dlress set off' a
round but not too tapering w:ist ,
there was a  heavy braid of vtllow -
,briow hair : a droopin.g cuirl ; a knot
of ribbon here, a tfll of lace there ; a
i flower pIlled carelessly through a soft
colored t.i athe white ti hroit l t. A
combinaltion lie scarcely untderstoodl,
yet hat Ilnllions on the extreme.
She was stately, yet there was a
certain prettiness about her all liher
B own. She seemed both gentle antl
strong, anld before lie was aware of it,
she had entered a door in his heart
;and sliot the bolt as securely as sheli
had fastened the door of her rooml
lthat night. A recess, too, it wals,
that he had never known before.
He was not very young. this man
of whoml I am writing. lie had not
been without his flirtations-his loves,
Sperhiaps. lut this girl's soft voice
and manner touliched a chord in his
I heart which had never vibrati'ed 1,h
Sfore. lie did not pause to ask why.F
lie had been a ge1nerous mall , ble- i
cause lie dIlspensd his charities with
lavish halind. lie was very tellnder aniid
kind to those lie loved, alw ays best of
all to himiself.
If lie fancied a house, a yacht, ai
horse, he purchiased it at once. lie
never sold his pliesenlt limomentll for
the future never longed for ia time
to COllie when he shouhlotte he aIllier,
hbt always graspedl the present pleas
uire, preferring it to promises of future
joy.
So, when he met Miss North, he
I said, at first, "She's very lovely"
and liy-and-bv whien he had twatched
her mnore closely, he told himself that
in all his travels he had never before
met a woman that ill his heart of F
hearts lie lonigeld to call his ownl. 'Ti't I
inight when the stars were out, and
the moon wails shining, they were all;
sitting upioi the lawn. First one and
theii another, under various excuses, i
paissed into the house. Miss 'Tholrne
went in to play, and Mr Thorne and
Ida still stood uplon the lawn, listen
ini . +
The words of a song floated softly
out, and they seemed to stir his mind
with a sudden purpose.
Many a girl I have loved for a minute,
Many a hieantifti face I have seen ; I
i verl and lye there was somethit g in it,
Soniething which could not be hlens. iy It
qutll ~ 'll. 1
IIe sCelanned her critically. There
was niota feiature ior expreslisioni if her I
face le would chanlige had he the -
power. There was more restless
ness in her eyes, to-night, and 'she
looked paler than she had done in
tihe day. I'erhapsll her heart was
touched also, but n1o matter. lie was s
sure she did not dislike himl, aind lie
could win her love ill time. And then,
without waiting further, he asked her t
to be his wife.
When Miss Ada Xortl' had closed t
the door to the outside world, she
wlent to the window and, throwing I
open the shutters, she knelt down in
the nmoonlight. Tearing a crumpled 1
letter fromi her pocket, she smiootlhed I
it almost fiercely, and read its mean- Ci
ing again, by the light of the moon.
'T'here was a wild restlessness about %
her, her hand trembled, and her red
lips were firmly set. It was written l
by a mina's hand, this ltter; her ir
heart had often throbbed for joy at' I
the sight of this sanle writing, but I
now it only brought a feeling of cold Vt
distrust andi tlislike. a
Shie rose, closed tile shutters ind f
lit the liump, and, taking a package of a'
letters fronl her trunk, she sat down F
and read them slowly, one by one.
Thley were all in this same hand- I
writing, and all breathing of love and i
devotion to hlerself. 1er task was I
not Ihalf accomplished when shie heard
quick footsteps in the space of a ii
breath. I
Shte rose hastily and nnlocked the I
door. Mary Thorne entered, uttered
an exclamation as she saw the letters II
scattered about the table.
"Wllat is it, Ada dear I" she ald. d
"There was one secret whlich I al- I
ways guarded from you, Mary," Ada
replied, qulictly. "Sit down. I will I
tell you all to night, for to-morrow I 1
shall liput it all aside." II
"Don't tell me unless you feel in
clined, Ada," her friend said, gently. y
"But 1 must tell you!" she ex II
claimled, impetuously. "You knew I 1
received letters from John Eastorn; c
but, as lie was the son of nmy guardi- .
an, you were never sure whether they t
were upon business, friellndship,, or ii
love. For two years I was engalged
to be his wife. We kept it secret, 5
for it was his wish. Three days ago I
thlis last letter came, saying lie was
mistaken in thinking lie loved me, t
and asking me to ieleise him foml
his promise. I have niot yet answer
ed him. Not that I hesitated for a
moment, but I could not binig myi- y
self to write himl yet. at
"Why should you nallow this to
trouble you !" asked Mary. "I, for j
one, am heartily glad; for, though ii
my acquaintancee with Mr. Eastern is t
very slight, I have always disliked I
him; anid then----"
"And then," interrupted Ada, with t
a smile, "LI know what yoiu woild say, a
dear. And the title is not half told. '
Your brother asked ame this evening It
to be hie wife." it
Tile words wele uttered quietly, '
bht the effect upon her listener was t
electric.
She sprang up, overturned her '
cnair, and caught Ada ill her armis.
"I'm so glad !" sihe saitl. "You told I
him yes, didn't you I Of course, you I
coulno't well do otherwise."
"No,n Ada answered, gravely.
"What !" And Mary held her out at t
arm's length, and gazed upon her for
a moment in speechless astonishment.
"DWgll you refiuso him i" a
"No," Ada again replied. "I am
to give him my answer in the morn- a

"Oh, I see ! Don't you dare to say t
no to him,' you darling! I have al. t

Would she meet him in the gahrdei in

t pack of cards.
I "It's all a game," she said; and I
ai aim playing i the dark."
1 And she shivered, though the morn
ing was Warmi.
Thie half-ihour hald lnealy pIassed
I when she rose, and taking the flowers C
- Ir. Thoiine had sent her, she pnlled d
some of them through her braids, anld,
her letters ill her han;d, she went down. 1
1 lie wits waeitilig at the doorIt with an i
elxpectant look it was hard to fatce i 1
the filll mornlng light; so that by the
time they had walked down the path I
to a quiet nook in a shaded cornelr of01 I
the garden, her eyes weie tl;shiug,
her cheeks were glowing, and the u
hands that clasped tie letters trems- a
bhling a trille; and as for :11r. 'l'horne
--he was, to be candid, slightly tier
vYoIs, too. iI
Ada, giving himl a shy fluttering II
glanse, saw it, and was inwardly I
thankful ; for she had learned to be ti
sulspicious of these men i hu o are al
ways self Ipossessed and cool.
"Well, imy darling f" lie said, ques- I
tioningly anid with a si. le.
"W'ell'" she an;swered him, hIesi. 0
taotilg, and not kniiowinig what to say. I1
'"llave you the answer I am waiting n
for ready !" he asked. c
"You have not repented f" she said. If
You are still willing to take me mer ,
better or worse, in yonr ilorniing r
conclusions ?" '
"Still willing," lie answered, "and g
very anxious too. Do you dolubt it ?" e
"No," she replied, staidly. "I don't tI
think I fully understand you, but I do to
niot doulbt. Now I will tell you what h
I could not explain last night. For i
long time I was engaged to Johihn Eas
lIton. I knew himl fromu my childhood, 8
at qiliet boy, stIitlioits and steady to ao
fault. As a imanI, lie seemed the soll fl
of hlonor, cautious, reliable, and cool. II
When lhe asked nme to niarly him, IP
said, 'If there be a man in this world e:
I can fully riespct aund trust, it is r
John Eastern.' I never qulestioned tl
hiln, never doubted anything lie ldidl l
or stid. ile wrote me of'eI1, fotnd, i
ailmost foolish letters. Here are fio r L
I selected to show you. Would you
like to see them I"
"No," lie answered, taking the fi
hand that held themi in both his. "
"You don't wanet me to readl thefr.,
darling, and I will not; I can fully t
believe what you say without proof." !
11er looks expressed her thanks. it
Her lips wtere growing unsteady, and ti
she waited a momient, trying to find I
her voice. ti
"Don't tell me this if it distress it
you," lie said, touclhing his lips to I
hers tenderly. "Tell me that you are 8
not boumid to this man now; tlhat is g
enough for ate. By.aid-by, when tl
you feel more composedl, I will listen ti
to the stolry, if you wish me to hear ti
it." P
She gazed at himt trulstingly, and it
she looked nmore childish than ever in P
her surprise.
"You are niot generous enough for
this 7' she asked.r
"I aum not generous when I do not P
love," lie answered ; "but I love you cI
fully--[ trust you utterly; I know f¶
yoll would not stoop to deceive me in ri
anything." f
Hlow we may wrong one nman by n
judging hi imby another !" she cried, if
