DOUBLE FORGERY.
Charged With One Offense a Seleder Re
peats it and Escapes.
New York, April 15.-With rifles
loaded and belts full of ball cartridges
detachments from the regiment at Fort
Lotten, Willet's Point, scoured the
neighborhood Monday in pursuit of a
comrade who was imprisoned for a
forgery and obtained his release by
another and promptly fled. The fugi
tive is a member of the Fifty-fourth
artillery and attached to the office of
Captain Bailey, disbursing officer for
the school of submarine defense. He
had access to the check book and
forged Captain Bailey's signature to a
check, which he cashed in his own
company. Obtaining leave of absence
he came to this city. Meanwhile the
forgery had been discovered and sol
diers dispatched in search of the clerk.
He was found and taken to the Fort
Totten guardhouse.
All day Sunday he was confined
there. Monday he was taken under
guard for an interview with Captain
Bailey. As he came out he handed to
the sentry a release, saying: "Give
that to the sergeant." The sergeant
recognized the order for release and
the clerk went to his tent. Hastily
bundling his civilian clothes together
he swam a creek which separated the
fort from the mainland and disappear
ed just as it became known that the
"release" was also forgery.
