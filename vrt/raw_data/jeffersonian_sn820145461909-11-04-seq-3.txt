What Our Farmers A re Saying and Doing
NINE TONS OF HAY FROM ONE
ACRE.
“Nine tons of hay is a large yield
of hay from a single acre and few
Would expect this yield from bermu
da grass, yet such is the case, or at
least from an acre of vetch and Ber
muda,” according to the Southern
Cultivator.
“Mr. J. B. Wing, who lives at Ros
well, in Cobb county, has an acre of
rich red-land in the rear of his home.
For years it has been sodded to Ber
muda, and has made remarkable
growth. A year or two ago he seed
ed it with vetch. Last year he cut
from this acre nine tons of well-cured
hay. While this is a remarkable
yield, considering the nature and
quality of the hay, yet Mr. Wing does
not consider this the limit. He says
if he would seed this acre to oats in
the fall and cut them as hay he be
lieves the yield can be increased to
twelve or fifteen tons of hay per
acre. Here is a higher standard for
you, but it is not the limit.”
$1,500 FOR ONE FARMER’S LABOR
IN 1909.
... < While down in Coffee county we
met Mr. H. W. Andrews, of Rock
ingham. In speaking of South Geor
gia and her crops this year, he said:
“With one mule and only the help
of two little boys eleven and thirteen
years old, I will make plenty of corn
to do me and sell $1,500 worth of
cotton. Have sold, already, $750
worth and will have as much more.”
This shows what a farmer can do by
his own labor. If a man can earn
SIOO per month in the cities he is
doing well. His expenses are double
those of a farmer. It seems to us no
farmer has room to complain when
he can make such earnings as this.
What Mr. Andrews has done others
can do.—Southern Cultivator.
FEEDING STALKS TO HOGS.
When the green stalks are given
to hogs care should be taken to pre
vent cattle from having access to the
woody fiber which the swine will
leave after chewing the stalks. Pigs
relish chewing the stalks for the
sweetnness in them, but leave
enough saccharine matter in the fi
ber to make it attractive to cattle,
especially the younger stock. This
fiber is indigestible, and the cattle,
if allowed to pick it up, will frequent
ly eat a sufficient quantity to cause
impaction and harmful if not fatal
results. It is not safe to let cattle
into the yards where swine are given
green cornstalks.—Coburn’s “Swine
in America.”
“Why, my dear sir,” said an old
farmer, “if you had the true inside
history of each case, you would find
that every animal in the Fat Stock
Show that sold for $l5O cost not less
than $300; and furthermore, those
over-fat cattle, which cost twice as
much as they sold for, were not worth
all they brought, from the fact that
there was a very large loss to the
consumer in fat, which cost just the
same per pound as good meat, but
which had to go in the soap-grease
class.” —Home and Farm.
This is the age of making experi
ments in farming,” says Home and
Farm. “One dairyman, who claims
to have experimented, says that ‘if a
person desires to get marked in
crease of milk he can get it through
using slightly warmed salted water,
into which bran has been stirred in
the ratio of one quart of bran to two
gallons of water. A very marked
increase of milk is produced in this
way.’ ”
LACK OF EXERCISE.
Lack of exercise is often the cause
for sickness in the poultry yard. Lazy
hens sooner or later have indigestion,
and other diseases can be traced to
lack of exercise.
At this season of the year cold
rains are frequent, and the hens will
crowd around the house and do no
work unless they have been provided
a light, roomy scratching shed.
There is always sufficient grain left
over in the litter to tempt the hens
to begin scratching at daylight, and
thus get their appetites in good or
der before the morning meal is ready.
Too much importance can not be at
tached to the scratching shed; in
fact, one should not expect the hens
to lay during the winter unless they
are kept busy. The more work the
bens do the healthier they will keep.
—The Poultry Yard.
HORSE SPECTACLES.
“The business of one well-known
firm of opticians in England consists
largely in the manufacture of horse
spectacles,” says the Farmers’ Union
Guide. “The object of the spectacles
is to promote high-stepping. They
are made of stiff leather, entirely
enclosing the eyes of the horse, and
the glasses used are deep concave and
large in size. The ground seems to
the horse to be raised, and he steps
high, thinking he is going up hill or
has to step over some obstacle. This
system of spectacles is generally
adopted while the horse is young,
and its effect on his step and action
is said to be remarkable. It has been
discovered that the cause of a horse’s
shying is, as a rule, short sight. It
is now suggested that the sight of
all horses should be tested, like that
of children.”
THE SEEDLESS TOMATO.
The latest and most interesting of
vegetable novelties is a seedless to
mato, produced as a result of experi
ments at the experiment station at
New Brunswick, N. J. Not every
fruit of the plant is entirely seedless,
though many of them are so; but
those that contain any seeds have
usually only half a dozen. An ordina
ry tomato, on the other hand, as ev
erybody knows, contains hundreds of
seeds.
Prof. Halsted, who has had charge
of the work, has produced seedless
fruits on several varieties and crosses
of tomatoes. In most cases, however,
they were dwarfs, many being no
larger than peas, though often of
excellent flavor. In one instance the
fruit tasted like a strawberry.
On the other hand, by crossing the
above-mentioned practically seedless
tomato (to which the name Giant has
7lkffftr>sonlart
been given on account of the great
size of the plant) with the crimson
cushion tomato, absolutely seedless
fruits were produced which were big
enough for table use. The work is
being continued and promises to re
sult in the establishment of a num
ber of satisfactory seedless varieties.

JUSTICE COURTS SHOULD BE
ABOLISHED OR CHANGED.
Our justice court system should be
abolished or rather enlarged. The
jurisdiction of justices’ courts should
be enlarged and a system established
that would permit one justice to try
all cases in the county at different
times, at stated places in each dis
trict as they are now held. This
would possibly be a little impracti
cable, but we think would be a decid
ed improvement on our present jus
tice courts.
This one justice should be placed on
a salary basis, and should be paid a
salary that would be commensurate
with the* hard duties he would have
to perform. Let him have his main
office at the county seat, but hold a
court once a month in each district
for the trial of cases.
Enlarge his jurisdiction so that
he could try any kind of a case not
involving more than SI,OOO and give
him jurisdiction to try all misde
meanor cases. Let no one except an
attorney-at-law, or at least one who
could stand an examination in the
various branches of law, be eligible
to election or appointment for this
position. Let each district have a
clerk or a notary public who could
issue all papers and a bailiff to serve
papers. Let all papers be made re
turnable to the monthly term of this
court. With such a system the busi
ness of any county could be kept well
in hand and there would be no neces
sity for city courts. People could
then have their cases tried in short
time, and there would not be the de
lay consequent upon trials under our
present system. Let the decisions of
these courts be subject to review by
the superior courts by writ of certio
rari, and let the action of the supe
rior court be final.
We submit this plan in a loose
way, and are aware that there are
many minor details not provided for
in this brief outline. How r ever, this
plan would be a great improvement
over the present system, as our jus
tice courts are almost a farce as they
are now conducted. We say this
without disparagement to any of the
present justices of the peace, for we
have always found the vast majority
of them doing the best they know
how, to administer justice in their
courts, but there are many who are
utterly ignorant of the first princi
ples of law. They are at the mercy
of the lawyers, and too often lawyers
seem to think their duty to their
clients requires that they evade the
law instead of enforce it. The con
sequence is, that the justice is often
misled and law and justice become a
misnomer in their courts.
There should undoubtedly be a
change.—Royston Record.
