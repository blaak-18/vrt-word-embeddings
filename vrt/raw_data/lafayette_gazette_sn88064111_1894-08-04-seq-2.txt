Citizens of New Iberia held a

the recent lynching there in unmea

adopted denying that the lynching
was-done by "cit;zens of Iberia" as
reported in a city paper. In all
seriousness, who did it ? Certainly,
'nobody would accuse the people of
Iberia of lynching a nigger.

Wonderful stories have been told
concerning the extreme delicacy of
the scales used by the mints at Pila
delphia and London. That at the i
first named place is said to tell the
exact weight of a hair; the London
wonder shows a difference in the
weight of a card after a name has
been written on it. "The most ac
curate scale in the world" is now
being discussed in England. It is
so finely balanced that it shows the
weight of a candle or taper to be
much less after the flame has been I
extinguished.

bf lodges of the infamous organiza
tion known as the Ametican Protec
tive Association, which has caused,
in some sections of the Union much
bitter feeling and in some cases the
shedding of blood. It was-a source
of great pleasure to us to believe
that Louisiana was blessed with the
absence from her borders of people
mean and narrow-minded enough
to join such an organization as the
A. P. A., but it appears that the
parishes of Winn and Grant are
cursed with citizens, who, in their
blind fanaticism, would take pleasure
in starving out every person who
dares to diagree with them on the
question of religion. Let us hope
that the good people of these
I arishes will do all in their power
to crush out of existence this viru
lent and dangerous ?brm of Nlo
nothingism, which, if not nipped in
the bud, is calculated to cause any
amount of strife and turmoil between
the white people of this State.
Men who will engage in the nefa
rious work of creating and cultiva
ting a spirit of religious intolerance
are enemies of society-as much so
as the highway robber and the mid
night assassin. It is a shame to
the State of Louisiana, if the fatnat
ical order of the A. P. A. is per
mitted to persecute honest people
and drive them away from their
homes on account of their religious
belief, as has been the case in
North Louisiana. The following,
taken from the Times-Democrat of
July 30, gives one an idea. of the
unmitigated meanness of the A. P.
A. cranks of Grant and Winn
parishes:
Alexandria, La., July 29g.--There is being
organized in Grant and Winn parishes a
society called the "*Junior Oorganization."
It is recruiting memlers from the Farmers'
Alliance and Populist party. The main
features are anti-Democratic and anti-Cath
olic. Senator Bryan and his son Represen
tative Hardy Bryan, seem to be the leading
spirits in it. They will not allow the numer
ous mills out there to hire Roman Catholics,
and make it so hot that those professing
that religion are leaving. The Times-Demo
crat correspondent met to-day a gentleman
who belongs to one of the mast prominent
families in Louisiana, and who, has had a
good position at Pollock. Ile passed through
en route to Texas, saying that he had to
leave on account of his Catholicism.
Major W. P. Grimes, ex-Representative
from Grant parish, says they are fully or
ganized. He could not tell whether it was
a branch of the A. P. A. Society or not, as
he did not know thier secrets, having refused
to join it.
Two Good Laws.
The following is thde full text of
an act passed at the last session of
the Legislature. It will check the
indiscriminate summoning of wit
nesses, which is sometimes clone by
lawyers for the purpose of impeding
proceedings in criminal trials at an
expense to the parish. It reads:
SECTION I. Be it enacted by the General
Assembly of the State of Louisiana, That in
all criminal cases on final trial, each side
shall not be allowed to summnon more than
six witnesses, unless the District Attorney or
other Attorney representing the State or
the accused or his council, as the case may
be, shall present a written application to the
judge, setting forth under oath what he -x
pects to prove by the additional witness,
that an additional number is required to
meet the ends of justice, and to make a
proper prosecution of defense, as the case
may be; provided, that in no case shall the
parish pay more than twelve (i2) witnesses
on each side in any case, and whenever
more than that number have been summoned,
and claim pay for their attendance, the
judge shall designate which twelve (x2)
shall be paid, according to the financial
condition of the witnesses respectfully, and
the trouble and expense entailed by their
attendance.
SEC. 2. Be it further enacted, etc.,
That Act No. 139, of 18go, and all other
laws or parts of laws, inconsistant herewith,
are hereby repealed.
The other law,which follows, pro
hibits the issuance by merchants
or corporations of tickets redeem
able only in goods at their own
places of business, a practice which
generally prevails on large sugar
plantations.
SECTION I. Re it enacted by the CrGeneral
Assembly of the State of Louisiana, That
hereafter it shall be unlawful for any per
sons, corporations or firm in this State to
issue tickets or checks redeemable only in
goods at their own places of business. But i
all such tickets shall be redeemable in United
States Currency and any contract or agree
ment to take and receive such tickets re
deemable only in goods shall be null and as
against public policy.
Sa.C. 2. That any persons or officers of
any corporation or firm issuing such tickets
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable
by fine of not more than one hundred ($Soo)
nor less than twenty-five dollars ($25), or
imprisonment at not- mare than six (6)
months and not less than one (5) month,
one-halfpf said line to go to the benefit of
the informer.
•SEc. 3. That this act shall take effect
from and after its passage.
From Gol. Robert Ingersoll.
Invention has Slled the worlt with com.
petitors not only of laborers but of mcchan
ics--mechanics of the highest skill. To-day
the ordinary laborer is, for the mst part, a
beg in the wheel. He works with the tire
less-he feedsthe insatiable. When the mon
ster,stops, the. mat is out of emhployment-
out f breat;. - He has not saved anything.
The machine that he fed was not -feeding
him--the invention was not for his benefit.
The other day I heard a man say that it
was almost impossible for thousands of good
.nmehnics to get employment, and that in
his judgmept the government ought to fur
nuja work or the people. A few minutes
laetr .I~hrd-tsither say that he was selling
a patert for catting out clothing, that one
of then mnthinds could do the work of
tetTytyailors and-that nnly the week~h-e ife
..- -..
, bit and gave
workmen by force of habit, gather about
the closed doors and broken windows and
talk about distress, the pric of food- and
the coming winter. They are convinced
that they have not had their share of what
their labor created. They feet certain that
the machines inside were not their friends.
They look at the mansion of the employer
but havewiothig-themselves. The~employer
seems to -have enough. Even. when - em
ployers fail, when they become bankrupt,
they are far better off than the laborers ever
were. Their worst is better than the toilers
best.
The capitalist comes foreward with his
specific. He tells the workingman that he
must be economical-and yet, under the
present system, economy would only lessen
wages. Under the great law of supply and
demand every saving, frugal, self denying
workman is unconsciously doing what little
he can do to reduce the compensation of
himself and his fellows. The slaves who
did not wish to run away helped fasten
chains on those who did. So the saving
mechanic is a certificate that wages are high
enough. Does the great law demand that
every worker should live on the least possible
amount of bread? Is it the fate to work one
day that he may get enough'food to be. able
to work another? Is that to be his only
hope-that and death?
Capital has always claimed, and still
claims, the right to combine. Manufactu
ries meet and determine prices, even in
spite of the great law of supply and demand.
Have the laborers the same right to consult
and combine? The rich-meet in the bank,
club house or parlor. Workingmen, when
they combinie, gather in the street. All the
organized forces of society ite against them.
Capital has the army and the navy, the leg
islature, the judicial and executive depart
ments. When the poor combine, it is a
"conspiracy." If they act in concert, if
they really do something, it is a ""mob."
If they defend themselves, it is treason.
How is it that the rich control the depart
ments of government? In this country the
political power is equally divided among
men. There are certainly more poor than
rich. Why should the rich control? Why
should not the laborer combine for the pur
pose of controlling the executive, the legis
lative and judicial departments? Will they
ever find how powerful they .are? A cry
comes from the oppressed, the hungry, from
the downtrodden, from the unfortunate,
from the despised, from men who despair
and from women who weep. There are
times when mendicants become revolution
ists--when a rag becomes a banner, under
which the noblest and the bravest battle for
fight.
How are we to settle the unequal contest
between man anti machine? Will the ma
chine finally go into parterneship with the
laborer? Can these forces of nature be
controlled for the benefit of her suffering
children? Will extravagance keep pace
with ingenuity? Will the workmen become
intelligent enough and strong enough to be
come the owners of machines? Will these
giants, these Titians, sho,rten or lengthen
the hours of labor? Will they give leisure
for the industrious, or will they make the
rich richer and the poor poorer? Is man in
volved- in the "general scheme" of things?
Can man become intelligent enough to be
generous, to be just, or does the same law
or fact control him as controls the animals
or vegetable world? The great oak steals
the sunlight from the smaller trees. The
strong animal devours the weak-everything
at the mercy of the beak, and claw, and
hoof, and tooth-o~f hand, and club, and
brain, and greed-inequality, injustice
everywhere. The poor horse standing in
the street with his dray, overworked, over
whipped, and underfed, when lie sees other
horses griooote to mirror, glistening with
gold and silver, scbrning with proud feet
the very earth, probably indulges in the
usual Socialistic reflections; and this same
horse, worn out and old, des.rtel by his
master, turned into the duity road, leans his
head on the topmost rail, looks at donkeys
in the field of clover, and feels like a Nihi
list.
In the days of cann'balism the strong dc
vourcli the weak-actually ate their flesh.
In spite of all the laws that man has made,
in spite of all advances in science, the strong,
the heartless, still live on the weak, the un
fortunate, the foolish. True, they do not
eat their flesh or drink their blood, but they
live on their lab,.r, on their self-denial,
their weariness and want. The poor man
iiwho deforms himself by toil, who labors for
his wife and children through all his anx
ious, barren, wasted life-who goes to the
grave with.out ever having a luxury-has
been the food of others. He has been de
voured by his fellowmen. The poor woman,
living in the bare and lonely room, cheer
less and fireless, sewing night and day to
keep starvation from her child, is slowly
behtg eaten by herfellowman. WhenI take
into consideration the agony of civilized
life-the failures, the anxiety, the tears, the
withered hopes, the bitter realities, the hun
ger, the crime, the humiliation, the shame
I am almost forc-d to say that cannibalism,
after all, is the most merciful form in which
man has ever lived upon his fellowmen.
It is impossible for a man with a good
heart to be satisfied with this world as it now
is. No man can truly enjoy evin what he
earns.-what lie knows to be his own-know
ing that millions of his fellowmen are in
misery and want. When we think of the
famished, we feel that it is almost heartless
to eat. To meet the ragged and shivering
makes one almost ashamed to be well
dressed and warm-one feels as though his
heart was as cold as their bodies.
In a world filled with millions of acres of
land awaiting to ibe tilled, where one man can
raise the food for hundreds, yet millions are
on the edge of of famine. Who can com
prehend the stupidity at the bottom of this
truth?
* - Is there to be no chlinge? .
Are the laws of "supply and demand,,'
invention and science monopoly and compe
tition, capital and legislation, always to be
enemies of those who toil? Will the workers
always be ignorant enough and stupid
enough to give their earnings to the useless7
Will they support millions of soldiers to
kill the sons of other workingmen? Will
they always build temples and live in huts
and dens themselves? Will they forever
allow Iarasites and vampires to live upon
their blool? Will they remain the slaves
of the beggars they support? Will honest
men stop taking off their hats to successful
.fraud? Will industry, in the presence of
crowned idleness, forever fall upon its
knees-and will the lips unstained by lies
forpver kiss the robber's and mpostert
hands?, Will they understand that beggars
cannot be generous, and that every healthy
man must earn the right to live? Will they
anally say that the man who has had equal
privileges with all others has no right to
complaint, or will the example that has been
set bty their oppressors? Will they learn
that force, to succeed, must have thought
behindml it, and that anything done, in order
that it may succeed, must rest on justice.
