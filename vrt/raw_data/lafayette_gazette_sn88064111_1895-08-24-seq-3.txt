THE SUMMER PROBLEM.
Where shall we go this summer? where shall
we while away
The brief ed all too fleeting hour.the sweet
vacation day?
In mountain lands or sea shore, on tarm or
hotel gay?
Where shall we ao this summer's the problem
of to-day.
Shall we get on an ocean steamer sad hie to
old Paree?
Or seek out Aunt Amanda 'way up in Seho
haree?
Shall we go to the wondrous valley-the grand
Yosemitee?
Or take a cot on a sandy lot hard by the sound
ing seas
Shall we so to the piny forest and fish for the
speckled trout,
Ad haul in splendid catches that all town
friends will doubt?
Shall we go to the rock-bound island on the
ocean tea miles out.
Or spend two months in a Teuton town and
dine on sauerkraut?
Shall we go to the Lake of Come? shall we
seek swell Newport's charms?
Shall we bask in the eye of Nature, or whirl in
Dame F'ashion's arms?
Shall we put o¢ our linen dusters and go with
the dear school-marms
Through the stony Hampshire mountains and
the old abandoned farms?
We won't do a single one of these-nay, may:

"About sixteen years ago, before I
abides in Wolfville, 1 was pesterin'

was workin' a small bunch of '7-bar-k'

been slashin' 'round the Plaza all day.

amoosin' ourselves at our own ex

the evenia' Bill allows he's some sick
of sech revels, an' concloods he'll pint
up among the 'dobys explorin' of Old
town a lot. So we all goes in concert.
I wasn't frothirn at the mouth none to
go myse'f, not seein' no relaxation
pokin' about permiscs among a passel
of Mexicans. an' me loathin' of 'em
nacheral; but I goes, aimin' to sorter
ride herd on Bill, which his dispisition
is some free an' various an' liable to
mix him into trouble. Not that Bill is
bad; none whatever, but bein' seven or
eight drinks ahead of that Plaza
whisky makes him feel gregar'ous and
friendly; an' he's cap'ble of goin' about
a-claimin' of acquaintance with peo
ple he don't know at all. an' fcelin'
'way hostile when the stranger has
symptoms of doubt.
"So I goes along; Bill a-werblln'

"The senoras and senoritas a-hearin'
of the row would look out an' smile,
an' Bill would wave his big hat an'
whoop from rapture. It he starts
towards 'em, aimin' for a powwow
which he does frequent, bein' a mighty
amiable man that away-they gives
a squawk immediate an' shots the

he gives the door a kick or two, in
formin' 'em of his discontent, but
that's all. All at once, while we're
prowlin' up one of them spacious al
leys a Mexican thinks is a street, we
comes up on a I-talian with an organ
which he is grindin'. This yere organ
ain't so bad an' I've heerd a heap worse
strains. As soon as Bill sees him he
tries to figger on a dance, but no one'll
dance with him.
"'In which event,' says Lockridge, 'I
plays a lone hand.'
"So Bill puts up a small dance, like
a Nava3o, accompanin' of himse'f with
BILL SHOOTS.
whoops. But the dago can't play Bill's
music, so the ball comes to a halt.
"'Whatever is the matter with this
yere tune box, anyhow?' says Bill.
'Gimme the music for a green corn
dance, an' don't make no delay.'
" 'This yore man can't play no green
corn dance,' I says.
"'Be can't, can't he?' says Bill,
mighty scornful. 'Wait till he tries. I
know this man of yore. I meete him
two years ago in Dnruoe's, an' me an'
him has quite a time.'
' *Whatever is his name then?' I asks
"'Antonio Marino,' says the daego.
S'Marino,' says Bill, 'that's right. I
rcalls it because it makes me think
feast he's a sheep man, an' I gets
quite hostile.'
" 'I never see yenou,' says the dago.
"'Yes, you did,' says Bill. 'You jest
think you didn't see me. We has
drinks together an' goes an' shoots up
the town arm an' arm like brothers.'
"But the I-tallan insists he never sees
Bill. This makes Bill ugly a lot, an'
before I can get to stop it he outs
with his six-shooter an' puts a hole inato
the organ.

says Bill, 'i a heap too frivolous.' as' E

"When Bill shoots the 1-talian sea
heaves the strap as holds him to the
ogan over his head an' flies
ketches the music box, keepin' it
fallin' an' after awhile beg turnin'
the crank to try it. It plays all right,
only ever' now and then there's a
hole into the melody like it had lost a
tooth I
"'This yere's goxod enough for a
dog,' says Bill~,twistin' away on the
organ. 'Where'~ Merino? Whatever is
the matter with him? Why didn't he
stand his hand?'
"But Merino ain't here no more, so
Bill allows it's a shame to let it go that
way, an' Mexicans sufferin' for music.
So he straps on the tune-box and goes
round from one 'doby to another
a-turnin' of it loose.
" 'How long did this yere Merino
turn out his tunes,' says Bill, 'before
he collects? However, I makes new
rools for the game right yere. I plays
these cadences for five minutes and
then I gits action on 'em for five. I
splits even with these Mexicans, which
is shorely fair.'
"So Bill twists away for five minutes
an' me a-timin' of him, an' then leans
the hewgag up agin' a 'doby as' starts
to collectin'. He'd go up to some
household a-whirlin' his gun like#
pinwheel, and at the mere sight of
him the members gets that generous
they even attempts to negotiate loans
and give 'em to Bill, they're that am
bitious to donate.
"One time he runs up on a band of
towerists, who was sorter trackin'
'round an' lookin' at things, and they
comes up an' listens awhile. They was
turnin' to go away jest before collect
in' time.
" 'Hold on,' says Bill, pickin' up his
Colt often the top of the organ. 'I've
seed people turn that Jack in church,
but you be t you can't jump no game of
mine that way. So jest you all line up
agin' the wall until I tucks the blank
ets in on this yere outbreak in F-fiat
I'm workin on, an' I'll be with you.'
"So when Bill winds up he goes
along the line of them tremblin' tower
ists an' collects eleven dollars.
" 'They was aimin' to git away withl
all them nocturnes an' peggios, an'
arias, an' not say nothin',' says Bill,
"HIOLD ON." SAYS BIL.Tl
'but they can come no twist like that
an' me a ridin' herd. None what
ever!'
"Bill carries on this away for three
hours; and what on splits an' what on
bets he win, he's over a hundred dol
lars ahead. But at last he's tired, an'
allows he'll quit and call it a day. So
he lugs the old tom-tom down to
Franklin's office. Franklin is marshal,
an' Bill turns over the organ an' the
money, an' tells Franklin to hunt up
Merino an' give him the whole shootin'
match.
" 'Vhere is this yere dago?" says
Franklin.
" 'However do I know'' says Bill.
'Last I sees him he was a-goin' up the
nalle like a jack rabbit.'
"Just then Merino comes in view
feelin' some pensive and fearful about
that bullet in his organ; but when he
gets Bill's donation his feelin's com
mences to rise a lot. In fact, he be
gins to regard it as quite a scheme.
" 'But you'll hay e to round up to the
alcalde, Bill,' says Franklin. 'I ain't
shore none you ain't been breakin'
some law.
"Bill grumbles an' allows Vegas is
gettin' a heap too reserved for him.
" 'It's gettin' so,' says Bill, 'a free
American citizen don't get no enr
couragement. Here I puts in half a
day amassin' wealth for a dago as is
sittin' in bad luck; an' elevatin' Mexi
cans who shorely needs it; an' yere I
am layed for by the marshal like a
felon.'
"'Vell, we all goes over to Steele's'
Franklin an' Bill and olbid Steele, the
alcalde, goes pokin' about to see what
ever crlmes Bill's done anyhow. They
gits by the capturin' the organ, an
shootin' into its bowels; an' standin'
up the towcrists didn't worry 'em none,
but the question of the music itee'f
sticks 'em.
" 'I'm shorely sorry to say it, Bill,'
says Steele, 'but you've been a-bustin'
of a ord'nance about playin' music on
the streets without no license.'
" 'Can't you beat the game no way?'
says Bill.
"'I bhorely don't see how,' says
Steele.
" "Mi tamblen,' says Franklin.
" 'Whatever is the matter with tack
in' them tunes on ter Merino's license?'
says Bill.
-'Can't do it nohow," says Stele.
" 'Well, is this yere ord'natiee ac
cordin' so Boyle an' the declaration of
independence?' says Bill. 'I don't
stand it none onless.'
"' bhore,' says Steele.
" 'Tarn your ards, then,' says Billl
'I'm a law-abidin' citisen an' all I
wants is a square deal from the warm
deck.'
"So they fines Bill fifty dollars for
playin' an organ on the streets with.
out license, and he pays it an' goes
away peaceful."--Chicago Times-Hler

OUT OF THE RUT.
WhO Strange but Sueeeufat Departere of
a Southern Planter.
A young farmer in the southwest,
having come into possession of a small
plantation through the death of his
father, determined to introduce some
radical changes. The farm had not
been profitable for several years. His
father had borrowed money of mer
chants and put every acre into cotton,
buying his food supplies every year
and running every year more deeply
into debt. Tie son was anxious, as he
said, "to get out of the rut."
He decided to abandon cotton-plant
ing, and to raise strawberries and oth
er fruit on a large scale, and, so far as
possible, to make a living from his
farm by producing his own food sup
plies. He began with a few acres of
strawberries, and put the remainder of
his land in corn, oats, grass, potatoes
and vegetables, increasing his supply
of poultry and pork.
All his neighbors remonstrated with
him. A southern planteet they said,
wvho did not raise cotton, but who de
voted his energies to small fruit and
"trucking," would be of no account
socially, while inviting financial ruin.
The young farmer was warned that in
breaking away from the customs and
traditions of the cotton belt he was
lowering his dignity and degrading
himself to the level of "the poor white
trash."
One critic was even more outspoken.
He was the father of the you rg woman
whom the young farmer had been
courting, and who was engaged to him.
"You are acting like a lunatic!"
growled this veteran. "What can you
do without a cash crop like cotton?
Where can you find a market for your
strawberries? You are as mad as a
March hare!""
"The finest varlelies of berries will
grow here to perfection. I can make
arrangements to send them by rail
north, where I shall be ahead of the
season, and also south for the latest
varieties when the home crop is ex
hausted. As for cotton, it is impover
ishing the planters here, as you well
know. Why should I raise cotton
without profit for the sake of what you
call social prestige?"
"Well, sir." was the angry reply, "if
you are bent upon going on with your
crazy schemes, you shall not drag
down my daughter with you. She is
a cotton planter's daughter, and shall
not be a truck farmer's wife."
As the daughter aided with the
father, the engagement was broken
off. The young man, undismayed by
the disapproval of his neighbors, car
ried out his plans with resolute deter
mination. The experiment was suc
cessful.
He was obliged to be patient as well
as determined, and the result was that
lie was soon obliged to double his
strawberry acreage. He then intro
duced raspberries as a crop to follow
the strawberries. The result has been
that he found his profits warranted
the purchase of another farm, and the
enlargement of his fruit business.
Meanwhile the planters around him
were many of them impoverished by
low prices for cotton. The veteran
who had called him a lunatic was re
duced to such straits that one or two
of his children went into the fruit
farmer's fields to pick strawberries in
their season for the wages they might
receive. Everyone now is convinced
that there was method in the young
planter's madness. - Youth's Comn
panion.
NAPOLEON'S DREAM.
He Longed to Follow In the Footsteps of
Alexander the Great.
Bonaparte was a child of the Medi
terranean. The light of its sparkling
waters was ever in his eyes, and the
fascination of its ancient civilizations
was never absent from his dreams of
glory. Hils proclamations rang with
classic allusions, his festivals were
adorned with classic ceremony. In in.
fancy he had known of Genoa, the
tyrant of his island, as strong in
the splendid commercial enterprises
which stretched eastward through the
Levant, and beyond into the farther
orient; in childhood he had fed his
imagination on the histories of Alexan
der the Great, and his conquest of ori
ental empires; in youth he had thought
to find an open door for his ambition,
when all others seemed closed, by tak
ing service with England to share the
renown of those who were building up
her eastern empire. Disappointed in
this, lie turned with the same lack of
success to Russia, already England's
rival on the continent of Asia.
It is perfectly comprehensible that
throughout his early manhood his
mind should have occasionally revert
ed to the same ideals. The conqueror
of Italy and Austria might hope to
realize them. Was he not master of
the two great maritime common.
wealths which had once shared all
eastern trade between them? En
gland's intrusion upon the Mediterra
nean basin was a never-ceasing irrita
tion to all the Latin -powers. lHer
commercial prosperity and her mastery
of the seas aggravated the exaspera
tion of France, as threatening
even her equality in their an
cient rivalry. From the days of the
first crusade all Frenchmen had felt
that leadership in the reconstruction of
Asia belonged to them by virtue of
preoreuuiation. Ardent republicans.
moreover, saw France's mission incom
plete in the liberalizing of the conti
nent, and the department of marine
under the directory stamped its paper
with the motto: "Liberty of the Seas."
Imaginative forces, the revolution
ary system, and the national ambition
all combined to create ubiquitous en
thusiasm for the conquest of the Medi
terranean. To this the temperament
and training of Bonaparte were as the
spark to the tinder. It was with will
ing ears that the directory heard his
first suggestions about the Venetian
isles, and subsequently his plans for
the capture of Mlalta, which was to be
followed by a death-blow to England's
supremacy in the seizure of Egypt and
the dismemberment of Turkey.--ProL
