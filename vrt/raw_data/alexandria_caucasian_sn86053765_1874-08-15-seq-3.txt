impart a high order of scientific
and literary education.
In some respects, the older and
more renowned colleges of the land
are superior ; hi t in others, such as
its admirable general library, books

young Louisiana Institution has
not many equals, we believe, in the
South, and, perhaps, no superior
in this country.
It has a large faculty of well
qualified professors, and we com

,
worthy of respect and confidence.
Wc hope it may soon receive
that support from the people of the
South which it so well deserves.
It should be a matter of pride with
Louisianians to uphold this State
Institution.

The Elections.
R ai.kigit . Aug. 7.— Democratic gains re
ported from every p "rt of the Stale. The
State is Democratic by from 10,000 to 20,
000 majority. Seven Democratic Congress
men out of eight , and a Democratic gain of
some twenty in tlie Legislature. There
great rejoicing in the city: speaking in the
street« all day, and caution booming.—
Wake county Democratic for t!ie first time
in fourteen years.
W ilmington , Aug. 7.—Returns received
to-day, from all over the State, are but
confirmation of last night's dispatches.—
The Conservatives have swept the State
like a whirlwind. Legislature conserva
tive by a largely increased majority. In
this, the Fourth Judicial District, the ma
jority for McKay, Conservative, will prob
ably reach 500 or 700. The returns now
coming in are all one way. It is impossi
ble to estimate correctly the majority for
the State ticket, but it will probably rcac h
10.000
Knoxvii.lk , Term. Aug- 7.—The election
in Knoxville and Knox county yesterday
was the most exciting held for many years
Horace Maynard made two speeches du
ring the canvass, endorsing the civil rights
bill as a party measure. Senator brown
low was openly hostile to the bill, which
he termed the sum of villainy and quint
essence ofabouiinations. The result- oft lie
lection was a complete revolution
throughout the city arid county, with
sweeping majorities for Conservative and
anti-civil-right* ticket. The city was wild
with joy last night, and country people
are, crowding into town today, rejoicing
over the unexampled victory.
Nasiivii.i.k . Aug 7 — Kvery ward and all
listicts here, except the Thirteeith and
Thirtieth, have made official returns.—
Kcgular Democratic ticket elected by a
majority of from ','000 to 3000. Judge
Cooper, for Chancellor, 250 over Brien, and
Mricn and McLain together, Two dis
tricts have 3350 over Brien, and over Bri it
and Mcl.ain together 932. Two districts
to be heard Iroiu will not change the re
sult either way over 100. The Jesuit
throughout the State, so faras heard from,
is that tlie Democrats have swept the
State and elected their candidates in every
county. Knox county gives tlie Demo
crats 300 to 91/0 major ity.
M km I'HI s , Aug. 7.—Keports front Tipton,
Fayette, Henderson and McN'airy. state
those counties have gone Democratic.
Ill Brownsville District, Livingstone,
Democrat, was elected Chancellor by 4000
majority.
The election in VicUsbnrg where
the issue was White vs Black,
passed ort quietly, and resulted in
a grand victorv for the whites.

The moral to the following,
told by the sufferer, is too apparent
to mention. Young ladies will here
after run their brothers out when
gentlemen call :
I'm certain [ wished somebody
would spank the young rascal. Wc
talked of hills, mountains, valleys
and cataracts I believe I said water
falls, when the boy spoke up and
said r
" Why, sister's got a trunk full
of them up stairs ; pa says they are
made of horse hair."
The revelation struck terror into
me, and blushes into the cheeks of
my fair companion.
It liegmi to be very apparent to
me that I must be very guarded in
what I s;iid, lest tlie boy might slip
in his remarks at uncalled for pla
ces; in fact I turned my conversa
tion to him, and told him he oiiffht
to go home with me and see what
nice chickens we had iu the coun
try. Unluckily, I mentioned a
yoke of calves my brother owned.
The little one looked up and said:
"Sister's got a dozen pair of
them, but she don't wear 'eiu only
when she goes up town on windy
days."
" Leave the room, yon unmanner
ly wretch !" leave quick !"
"I know what you want me to
leave thf room for," he replied ;
"you can't fool me. You want to
set on that man's lap and ki>s him
like you did Bill Jones trie other

On Friday morning almost up to

pretty fair freight for low water, a fair
freight now means next to nearly
nothing.
The Sabine stuck on tlie Falls the
balance of Thursday and Thursday

that she will be obliged to return and
put out some of her cargo before she

Our crops, particularly in the Pine
woods, are suffering very much for
want of rain, and a continued dry
spell will reduce the yeild verv much —
already we hear of forms falling off,
and we fear the yotttig bolls will not
mature if we have no rain itt tlie course
