TEXAS KLAN TO BUILD
$200,000 KLAVERY
Fort Worth Klan No. 101,' Realm
of Texas, is planning the construction
of a klavern building which will cost
$200,000. Thi Klan is in excellent
financial condition, having recently
disposed of some valuable property
holdings and its membership of sev
eral thousand is enthusiastic and
ready to go.
Plans for the magnificent Klavern
were discussed at a great Klan rally,
naturalization and barbecue held

UNIQUE CERMONIAL
BY CLARKSBURG KLAN
Clarksburg Klan, Realm of West
Virginia, staged a great open air
ceremonial at Jackson’s Mill near
that city last week, naturalizing over
five hundred aliens. The Grand Klo
kard of West Virginia officiated.
Three thousand Klansmen in full
regalia paraded before a gathering
of about ten thousand interested
spectators. * They formed themselves
into an immense human group of
letters reading “Ku Klux Klan” be
neath the light of three large fiery
crosses. The spectators cheered them

KLANSMEN
RALLY TO THIS WORTHY CAUSE-
Seldom have you had the opportunity to contribute to a cause that has
become as widespread as the one we are about to mention. You no doubt
have taken great pride in being able to give a little to various charities as
they have presented themselves.
You, as we, know only in a small way the activities of the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan in a national way.
We take this opportunity of telling you of the greatest Klan enter
prise that has ever until now presented itself to you.
El Dorado Klan No. 92, Realm of Arkansas, conceived the idea of
erecting a hospital dedicated to the cause of suffering humanity. Elma
Coble Comer Memorial Hospital, named for the deceased wife of our
beloved Grand Dragon, Judge James A. Comer, was at first intended to
be built by El Dorado Klan No. 92, but because of the publicity we have
received from various sources we have gotten many donations from all
over the United States.
INSTITUTION WILL BE NATIONALLY KNOWN!
Since the the boys won’t let this Klan build this hospital by ourselves,,
we have decided to give every Klansman in the United States an oppor
tunity to be a benefactor in this institution.
The contemplated cost of the hospital is $150,000, the site has already
been purchased and work will start in the near future on the building.
BROTHERS, READ THIS CAREFULLY
The Klansmen throughout the country will take a just pride in this
Memorial Hospital because of the fact that it is the first of its kind in the
United States and because of the fact that it will be owned and operated
by and under the jurisdiction of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
As you know, the Klans have been prompt in making donations to
various worthy causes, now the time and opportunity has been provided
and we may all chip in together apd build an institution that will stand as
a gigantic monument lasting down through the ages.
This moument will proclaim the teachings and principles of our
worthy organization and show the entire world that the Klan stands for
the better things in life.
The meager mite that you may give to this worthy cause, while it
may seem trivial to you, will assist in completing the hospital and we will
send you a certificate proclaiming the fact that you have helped to build
the Elma Coble Comer Memorial Hospital and your name will also be
placed in the cornerstone.
Listen, Christian Klansmen! Is it not written that we are our
brother’s keeper? This hospital will stand as an imposing monument of
our thoughtfulness of our fellowman less fortunate than we.
We help to restore into fallen mankind their faith and confidence in
their fellowmen. We are following the teachings of Jesus Christ by bind
ing ourselves together to assist in relieving those sick and in distress.
DO IT NOW, KLANSMEN!
Help the world by living in it. You need not pray over the matter. ,
You know your duty. It is more blessed to give than to receive. We ask
that you send NOW just what you feel you can afford that this work may
be pushed forward to completion.

Cairo, 111.—Upholding the Ku Klux

Cairo “Bulletin” for its attitude
towards the organization, the Rev. W.
P. Anderson, pastor of the * First
Christian church, preached to an
overflowing audience here on a re
cent Sunday night at his church, on
“A Liar’s Fate.”
Rev. Anderson declared that he
had * been in a town where the Ku
Kl*x is strong and that it had done
wonders for the moral atmosphere of
that town, Springfield, Mo., he said,
was rotten until the Klan organized
and the burlesque shows were closed
on Sunday and other reforms insti
tuted, through the influence of the or
der. “What are the newspapers of
this city doing for its moral uplift?”
he asked.
The editor of the “Bulletin” said
Rev. Anderson, should not condemn
an organization about which he has
no inside information. He suggest
ed that the editor read Chapter 5-7
•of Matthew and put' them into prac
tice.
“It is nobody’s business,” said
Rev. Anderson, what the Klan does
with its ten-dollar initiation fee.
“The Mason’s fee is SSO dollars and
up and it is nobody’s business what
they do with their money, either.”
“So long as the federal govern
ment does not interfere with the or
ganization, any citizen may feel jus
tified in defending and belonging to
it,” Rev. Anderson declared.
“Politicians are so rotten,” he de
clared, “that even the newspapers
are being used by cheap politicians
to play their dirty games. l A good
man will not run for office for fear
of newspaper lies that will be cir
culated. The Klan is not a partisan
organization. It stands for clean
politics, and every decent citizen
who wishes to play the game on the
square and to be honorable, ought to
belong to it, if he is eligible.”
They met on a bridge. Each held
out his hand, and they shook, and in
stantly realized that they were utter
strangers. Had not one of them
been a genuine Hibernian the situa
tion might have been embarrassing.

JUST SO
A TRIBUTE AND A CHALLENGE TO THE
WONDERFUL WOMANHOOD OF AMERICA
By the Grand Dragon of the Realm
of Arkansas.
The very mentioning of the word
“Woman” always -'arrests the atten
tion of every true man at once.
Whatever else the human heart may
forget in. the rough experiences of
life, it cannot forget its mother.
“That sacred word is ne’er forgot
No matter where we roam;
The deepest feeling of the heart
Still cluster 'found our home.”
Of all human appellations, the
tenclerest, the most endearing, in
spiring, and enobling are mother,
sister, sweetheart, wife and daughter.
Some of the noblest lines in all the
best literature are tributes which
great men of the world have paid to
their mothers and wives.
It is said that ancient Greece and
Rome boasted of fond mothers, who
nobly trained their sons to the service
of their country.
Napoleon Bonaparte, as he looked
into the secret of his impending
Waterloo, said, “The great need of
France is not men, but mothers.”
The strange, wierd Mohammed
said, “An ounce of mother is worth
a pound of clergy.”
It is too common-place to quote
the familiar tribute of the immortal
Lincoln to his mother, “All that I
am, all that I hope to be, I owe to
my sainted ' mother.” Was it not
John Randolph of Virginia who said
that when he tried to become an
infidel he was always intercepted by
the memory of his mother’s hand
upon his head, and her loving, trust
ful voice, as she taught him to pray
“Our Father Who are in Heaven.”
When the eloquent S. S. Prentiss
was elected to congress, Mrs. Judge
Prebble said to him, “I have been
very anxious to meet your mother
since your election to congress in
order to congratulate her on having
such a son.” But he bowed very low
and said, “Madam, you should con
gratulate the son on having such a
mother.”
Can we ever forget the tribute
Garfield paid to his mother at his
inauguration? When he had taken
the oath of office, and was proclaim
ed president of the United States, he
turned to his grand old mother, who
was sitting near him, planted a kiss
upon her lips, and said that all the
honor was due her?
Throughout the old testament, and
all history, great women now and
prominence, despite the ignorance,
prejudice, and superstition which
relegated them to the realm of the
unnoticed.
But it remained for Him, who
turned the world upside down, to dis
cover woman, and start her on the
upward road, which has culminated
in her present emancipation in
America.
Work for Christianity
Much has been said about what
Christianity has done for women,
many books have been written on
this enchanting! theme, but it re
mains for some great pen to fully
tell the story of what women have'
AN APPEAL TO CATHOLIC HONOR
By OTIS L. SPURGEON
There is a Protestant honor as
everybody knows. I am not saying
that it is always the same or always
of the same measure. We have it in
varying proportions and many times
it takes on the semblance of a com
munity conscience, if you know what
that is. I frequently come in contact
with it. Protestants differ in their
estimation of things and their enthus
iasm about things. You just cannot
get them to believe the same thing
nor will they have the same apinion
about matters. They are free and
frank to express their thoughts and
my, how they vary. Protestants will
denounce Protestants. Sometimes in
the right and often in the wrong.
But it matters not as to the side a
Protestant takes he has come out in
the open, often, and let himself be
heard and known on great and vital
issues. It is highly honorable to con
fess a wrong and to stand for the
right. A man with honor will always
declare himself and stands not afraid
of anything or anybody. He has no
trick cards to play and when
declared himself yoy can generally
place him and at once know where he
stands. Not so with Romanism! Take
anything in which Romanism figures
and they will stand together as one
man. And no matter how wrong the
thing is it makes no difference with
Church. Did you ever hear a Roman
Catholic denounce a practice of their
Church? Did you hear a Roman
Catholic say aught against the un-
American writings contained in their
newspapers? They have done many
grave and lawless things in the past
ten years, but where is the Roman
Catholic that you know of who has
openly came out and disavowed these
outrages committed by Knighs of Co
lumbus ? They have mobbed and
bruised and killed Protestant speak
ers in the last ten years, but never
once have you seen or heard one
word of protest escape their lips. Al
ways from their papers they have
done for Christianity. Through the
elevation and inspiration which Chris
tianity has given women, they have
functioned for the benefits of so*
ciety in ail the realms of life. ,
Because of the Mariaolatry of the
Roman Catholic church, the name of
Mary, the mother of Jesus, has al
most been a forbidden theme in Prot
estant pulpits. But under the present
process of ridding America of Catho
lic ideas, the true evaluation of the
mother of our Lord will take place.
The women of the new testament
form a circle of representative wo
men, and are prophetic of the evolu
tion of sentiment and judgment which
we witness today. The process of
working of the leaven has been slow
but sure.
Glance at the group: the Marys,
Elizabeths, Anne, the daughters of
Philip, who prophesied, that group
which formed the first ladies’ aid as
sociation, and ministered to Jesus,
Priscilla, who was a part of the
faculty of the first theological semi
nary, Phoebe, Dorcas, and all the
rest. Jesus, called these out, even in
the day in which He lived, and they
stood out, and it was impossible to
keep them down. These, indeed, as
I have said, were representative
women in the highest sense.
What Jesus said to Dorcas, Chris
tianity has been saying to women
ever since—“ What hast thou in thy
hand?” This quiet, modest, well-to
do widow said, “I have a needle in
my hand,” and He said, “What will
you do with it?” She said, “I will
consecrate it to Jesus.” And from
the shining example of this modest
widow of Joppa has come forth all
the women’s societies, guilds and
clubs, all through history.
Jesus is saying today, “Woman,
what hast thou in thy hand?”
No longer will man say that in
the hand of woman rests the necessity
of rocking a cradle only. She has
within her hand the power to rule
the world. ,
But I must leave this inviting
field, and fix your minds on American
women.
In the cabin of the Mayflower, the
compact of self-government set forth
was as much an interpretation of
those noble women as it was the
forty-one men who signed it.
Shape America’s Destiny
The American woman has had as
much to do with the shaping of the
destiny of America, as the American
man. The same desires which burned
in the hearts of the Pilgrim fathers
for a place to worship God without
interference, burned in the hearts of
the Pilgrim mothers. The burden of
rearing children and bringing them
up in the nurture and admonition of
the Lord in a free and independent
country was upon the heart of the
mother more than it was upon the
heart of the father. They were not
only help-meets, but help-mates to
their husbands. Their holy hands
helped to build out of these forests
homes, churches and schools.
In times of peace, she has shared
offered an excuse or deliberately
printed a lie. The writer of this ar
ticle was mobbed in Denver on April
5, 1923, by 350 Knights of Columbus
and left for dead on the prairies of
Adams County, Colorado. He passed
through ten other minor mobbings
that same year but he has yet to hear
of one Roman Catholic who expressed
himself as regretting the circum
stance. Instead the writer can show
letters, always unsigned, of course,
offering to finish the Denver mob
bing.
One letter with a dagger drawn
thereon with red ink and drippings of
ink to represent blood, with these
words below it, “we’ll get you yet.”
Another with the words “we have a
pot of tar and feathers ready for you
when you arrive in this town.” The
fact is from the least to the greatest
from the youngest to the oldest, they
all think and believe the same thing
and within their breast is not the
heaving of one sigh in sympathy to
the victim who has fallen at the
hands of their militant crowd. They
killed Black in Marshall, Texas, in
February 1915, and how many'letters
of sympathy do you imagine his wid
ow ever received? Klansman Ab
bot of Carnegie, Pa., sleeps in a grave
having been killed by McDermot, the
Knight of Columbus undertaker. But
do you suppose that Mrs. Abbott ever
received one word of sympathy from
that crowd? One would naturally
think that these actions of theirs
would at least drive some one out of
the church and into tjie open to ex
pose all of this. Nay, not so! In
stead they huddle closer together.
Look up your files of The Memphis
Commercial Appeal of the year 1914
in the month of April and see how
much the editor had to say about the
Spurgeon mobbing in Denver or in
February, 1915, of the Black killing
by Knight of Columbus Copeland, a
bank cashier ? And listen, my patient
reader, they are the ones that today
are doing the lying on the Ku Klux
the glow and glory of the fire-side.
In times of war she “stayed by the
stuff.” A noble woman is the em
bodiment of loyalty and love. She
will stand by her husband —right or
wrong. She shares both sorrows and
joys. In sunshine she is vine and
flower. In storm she is rock and oak.
As go the women, so goes the world.
They are the Goddesses of Liberty,
enlightening the world.
In the pioneer days of American
history the Pilgrim mothers not only
endured the hardships of the Pilgrim
fathers, but, what was a greater bur
den, they had to endure the Pilgrim
fathers. American women are the
uncrowned partners of American
men.
In modern times they have taken
their places in the thick of the fight
and ministered to the bodies and
spirits of the soldiers in the trenches.
The time has come when women
can no more be limited to home ac
tivities. They must, and will, take
their places in the broad activities
of national life.
In literature, in art, in music, and
in the varied professions, women who
have elected to excel in any of these
lines have demonstrated their ability
to stand shoulder to shoulder with
men.
Women And The State
The exercise of women’s rights in
the affairs of state is inevitable. The
women’s day is here. The right to
vote carries with it the obligation
to vote. The power of the ballot now
granted to women is a challenge to
our real one hundred per cent Ameri
can women to join the men of the
nation in laying the axe of the ballot
at the root of every American tree
which does not bring forth American
fruit. *
Ponder these statistics: In 1920
there were 54,421,823 men and women
in this country entitled to vote in the
presidential election. Only 26,705,246
voted. When you reflect that we
punish crime by disfranchising peo
ple, somebody is guilty of the crime
of disfranchising themselves. Who
is alseep?
There are many great organiza
tions among women, local, state and
national in their scope; but it remain
ed for the Women of the Ku Klux
Klan to set up and set forth the
only organization known to women in
which only one hundred per cent
American Protestant white women
can function.
Gentlemen, out of a heart filled
with tenderest recollections of a
mother’s solicitude, and love, and out
of the constant inspiration of a wife’s
undying affections, I have offered
these remarks as a simple tribute of
my own heart, and a challenge to the
women of America to arise and
claim their rights and take their
places alongside of the one hundred
per cent American men in their stride
across history to restate and reinstate
great American principles in this, our
God-given country.
Klan. They are the ones that are stir
ring up the minds of the Jews and ne
groes and making them think we are
anti-Jewish and anti-negro. Just last
Friday night the writter of this arti
cle was at Clarksville, Tenn. A busi
ness man there, a Knight of Col Jin •
bus, called in a leading negro and told
him that my lecture should not be
given as it would stir up strife aua
prejudice against the negro citizens
and they ought to band themselves
together and put a stop to this lec
ture. Can you not see the cunning
artful hand of the Jesuit in this? But
this negro was not to be so foiled,
lie laid the matter before an attorney
who advised him otherwise and sc
vhe writer is wearing his head todaj
because a negro refused to pull the
chesnuts out of the fire for this Ro
man Catholic.
But why this Roman Catholic solid
arity? Why this utter refusal of
theirs to show sympathy? Why this
lack of manly and womanly honor?
Simply because the Word of God, The
Scriptures, has depicted them in this
fashion, “He hath given them over to
believe a lie in order that they should
be damned.” Oh, the Bible has a
plenty to say in regard to this organ
ization that calls itself a church and
when the preacher see these truths as
he should and will then au re voire
Romanism.
I am just writing down my
thoughts with no intention to write
even an article on Roman Catholic
honor. I will allow you, after
thoughtful reflection, to be the judge
as to whether they possess any?
