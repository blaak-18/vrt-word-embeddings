"Gentlemen, I understand that cer

ed some member of the jury and madi
inquiry as to matters which have been
before the jury. If this is a fact I
want you to report it to the court, or
if there have been any overtures, or
intimations to you."

son, arose and stated that on hi; r'
turn home Thursday night a man of
medium height with blIak hair. w";l
dressed. and -f good address, was at
his home.
"The man gave his name as MWD-w
ell, and said his home was at Ina i
apolls. Ind.; that he knew V. S. Ta'
lor; that he knew I was a memb-r of
the jury which had the invs igaiion
of Henry E Y~outsey; that since the

timony of Youtsey that Taylor was
.much worried. had grown emrracit=d:
teat he (McDowell) knew all the mem
bers of the jury had a diagram of
their houses and knew where they
lived. He said he wanted to talk ur1
vately with me. and said that he want
ed information abort the testimony
of Youtsey and would get money for
It, and that he would divide with me.
'He called me outside of the house
and stated that If there was enough
I evidence against Taylor to convict him
(Taylor) that he with others would
kidnap Taylor and oring him here and
divide the reward wjth me. He then
offered me inoney, which he had in his
hand, and I refused it; then he shoved
some moasey in my vest pocket and
told me to buy me a hat with It. that
be saw there was no opportunity to
get the information. He said he was
stopping at the -Capitol hotel and had
driven out to my houes."

in this style is a black silk plush hat
on whose flat top tabs of apple green
silk are held down by a mandarin's

The all round toque of the shah of

when built in ermine with a magnifi

The January Sales Reveal Many
Dainty Novelties.

stores I lessoni :It with tluff of
white things. Tfidd'e :re . iaiiny of
these dainty t in.s sihown that it is
diflicult to see jew any wmre .. .Id be

the way fronm two to ten ruthes, these
generally maide of fine batiste and bor
dered with deliate lace. The lave best
liked for this trimminig is va I.nciennes,
but there is a little pdint de Paris seen.
I)RT AM) CORSET COVER.
This is a durable lace and rather more
shewy than the other. hut it is not so
dainty.
Drawers are nearly all matde veiy
short, reaching no farther than the
knee and trimmed with umbrella
ftouncei, each being ruffled all they
will hold. These garments for all of us
are now made almost like those wor
by the skirt dancers as far as rnotlig
Ds concerned. Umbrella ruffles are
made wIth one deep shaped flounce,
and on this ns set another, ad this Ih eD
turn decorated with several rows of
lace os ,le embroidery gathered on
full. Pretty bows of narrow ribbon are
set at the sides. I may also mention
by at tsttht dhe top is fitted asrly so
thst nothing may Irterfere with the
met of the close detting dress.
Nedt comes the corset wattr and
skirt combhined. This Is a comparative

Per several years women have ils
ets'ted ehemises as unnecessary. wear
-g only their union suits of fine Ban
aed undergarments In cold weather and
psne vents in warm days. This made
the corset waist a necessity, and to stilr
turther simplify things it was joined to
a suet of skirt. This has now given
place to the corset slip petticoat for
many occasions and the return to the
old chemise in all other cases. The
chemises of this sesaba are marvels of
daintiness, and all are made `with a
strong eyelet hole on each side of the
shoulders so that a bit of ribbon can be
run through and fastened there, and
that forms the sleeve, for all these
pretty gkrments are cut "sack shape."
In this way, if the owner wishes to
wear a low drews, all she has to do to
to untie the ribbons and tuck that pert
under and out of sight. Very little trim
ming is put around the neck, only the
narrowest of flue edging. *
The, night robes are large and loose
around the shoulders and without col
lars. The prettiest are cut square on
the front of the neck or V shaped, and
the rest of the front may be as orna
mental as one's taste and purse may
dictate. The dainty narrow ribbon ran
nings are pretty and add much to-the
effect, buit they must be washable or
