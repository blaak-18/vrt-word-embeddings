(Furnished to the Jeffersonian by our tal
ented friend, Miss Belle Boddie, of LaGrange,
Ga.)
“ASA HARTZ.”
Block 1, Room 12.
Johnson ’s Island, Ohio, April 25, 1864.
Dear Uncle Bob:
I fear your head
Has gone thinking I was dead,
That ice and snow and doctors’ arts
Has stopp’d the breath of “Asa Hartz.”
I write this in poetic lines
To let you know I live, by jingo.
And ask if you can bring about
Some certain means to get me out?
Haven’t you got a Fed’ral “Maje”
Now resting in some Dixie cage
Who longs to see his loving marm
Or visit once again his farm;
Or gaze upon his “garden sass,”
Or see once more his bright-eyed lass
Haven’t you one of these, I say,
Whom you would like to swap away
For me, a man of vim—of “parts”—
Swap him, in short, for “Asa Hartz”?
I’ve been here now almost a year
And sigh for liberty, so dear,
I’ve tried by every means I know
To bid this isle a fond adieu; *
Dug holes, scaled walls, passed thru the gate
With Yankee cap upon my pate,
And when I went out in the ice,
And thought I’d got away so nice,
I met a blue-coat in my route,
Who quickly made me face about;
March’d me, with diabolic grin,
Back to the gate, and turned me in.
I’ve swallowed every rumor strange
That had a word about exchange,
Grew fat with joy, lean with sorrow,
Was “up” today and “down” tomorrow;
Implored, with earnestness of soul,
To be released upon parole;
Wrote Ben F. B. a spicy letter,
And told him he could not do better
Than let me out for thirty days.
I read his answer in amaze;
He said that “things” were mixed up, now
In such away, he knew not how,
The favor that I asked about
Could well be granted. Had no dounbt
That “things” would soon be so arranged
That all of us would be exchanged.
That ended it. I wrote to Prentice,
Who several times had kindly lent his
Purse and name to those whom chance,
And “pomp and glorious circumstance,”
Had sent to rusticate awhile
Within the “prison Johnson’s isle.”
Well, George D. wrote to General Terry,
Commandant here —a good man, very—
And told him if he’d let me out •
For thirty days, or thereabout,
He’d take me down into Kentucky—
See that I didn’t “cut my lucky,”
Would go my bail in any sum,
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
That when they wanted me —I’d come;
General Terry wrote him back,
That he must walk the beaten track;
“I really thought,” said he, “you knew it,
That Stanton, and he alone, can do it.”
Thus ended that plan, I’ve no doubt,
That I’m almost “gone up the spout,”
Unless you can devise some means
To give me change of air and scenes,
By special swap.
Now Uncle Bob,
Be patient with me.; do not rob
Me of the hope I fondly cherish —
Do not leave me here to perish;
I’ve shuffled the cards and dealt,
Have played my bower (its loss is felt
More than the loss of filthy lucre),
Please play my hand —save me the euchre;
And, when your latest breath departs,
You’ll die bewailed by Asa Hartz.
P. S. —When you in answering this shall
write,
Address me —“Major George McKnight,
Pris. of war.” Be cautious very,
And add in “care of General Terry.”
This racy poem was found in an old scrap
book. “Asa Hartz,” or Major George
McKnight, will be remembered as one of the
bravest, one of the most loyal, of Confeder
ates. B. B.
A WAR-TIME LYRIC.
(These beautiful and pathetic lines were
furnished by Miss Belle Boddie.)
When I Was a Little Boy.
I have found the wisdom born of pain,
The sorrow that comes with years,
And paid the price that Adam paid
For knowledge and for tears.
But I’ve lost my faith in friendship’s vow
And love is a broken toy,
I used to trust in mother and God,
When I was a little boy.
0 sadder than death is the bitter change
In the trusting heart of youth!
Better believe in a wholesome lie
Than to forever doubt the truth.
What care I now for author’s fame,
Or the ten years’ siege of Troy?
The heroes are myths that I used to love
When I was a little boy.
(The above verses were written during the
Civil War by a brave and talented young Con
federate who was being harbored for a few
days in LaGrange, Ga. While there he wrote
the lines on rough parchment with pencil.
Have never been published, only in small
county paper. B. B.)
A new Oklahoma law makes it unlawful for
a man to carry liquid refreshments of an ar
dent variety in his pockets. Still, we should
think the prohibitionists would admit that is
better than carrying it in his anatomy.
