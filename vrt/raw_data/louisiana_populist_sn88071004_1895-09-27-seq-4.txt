STORY OF BOLD BILLY.
HERE HE CAME
from and how he
happened to wan
der into Satan's
Camp no one could
tell.
lie was a boy of
about fourtes t,,
freckle faced, wild
S eyed, and so very
timid that he would
jump if spoken to
suddenly in a loud tone of voice.
In fact, to confess the whole truth
Hle was none too well supplied witl
"gray matter." although he was not an
outright fool.
Satan's ('amp was the wickedest town
of its siz' in the territory. It was the
boast of its inhabitants that more men
had bee' killel in Satan's Camp than
in any other town of its age west of
the Rockies.
Not a very "healthy" place for a
timid, half-witted lad to stray into.
And It happened that the first buill
ing he entered after striking the town
ºwas ".Murphy's Hole." the most dis
rel)utable gambling den and gin-mill
in Satan's Camp.
A tough gang always loafed around
Murphy's. and it was on hand when the
boy appeared.
"Whoop!" cried Red Hutch, as his
eyes rested on the lad. who was hesi
tating near the door. "What's this I
sre? Is it a kid? Wall, I'm derned
ef a kid haln't come in hyer!"
Then he pounced on the unoffending
boy and dragged him forward into the
midlle of the room.
Th;,re the boy was quickly surroini
ed by the ruffianly crew, who began
to make sport of him.

"WYOT'S YER NAME. KID?'
If ever a boy was frightened it was
the one in the clutch of Red Hutch.
'Wot's yer name, kid?" demanded
the ruffian, as he gave the lad a savage
shake. "Speak up lively!"
"Bub-bub-billy Bub-bub-bolden,"
was the reply that came through the
chattering teeth of the unfortunate
waif.
Billy Bolden, eh? Wall, that's a nice
name for a kid like you to wear around!
Billy Bolden-Bold Billy. How is that
for a handle, pards?"
"It's great!" shouted Red Hutch's
sycophants, "Hooray fer Bold Billy!"
From that hour the boy was known
in Satan's Camp as Bold Billy.
Before he escaped from Murphy's he
was nearly frightened out of his wits
for he was made to dance to the tune
of pistol-shots, while the ruffians
roared with laughter.
Shaking like a leaf he finally sue
ceeded in getting out of the saloon, and
then ran as fast and as far as he
could.
Finally, overcome with terror and
exhaustion, he fell in a fainting, quiv
ering heap beyond the limits of the
town, and there Old Grim found him.
Old Grim was a grouty hermit who
lived beyond the limits of Satan's
Camp.
He was something of a mystery.
He had been there when the first
prospector "struck yaller" at the spot
where the camp stood, but the dis
covery of gold had not seemed to af
fect the queer old man in any way.
He lived on in his secluded fashion,
and the people that came to the mush
room camp grew to know him by sight,
but no other way.
He would have nothing to do with
then.,
01d Grim's clothes were in rags, and
he appeared like a wreck of better
tares.
He spoke kindly to the boy.
At arst Billy was too frightened to
tell his story, but he fnally succeeded.
Old Grim listened to the end, and
then he aid:
"It is like those human beasts down
thee. Come with me; I will care for
pMo.
8o he took the boy to his cable, and,
tem that day, Beld Billy wa Old
Grim's shadow--where one went the
ether miht be aeen.
While Orem lived, the hbey we
uB blh I U bbs's .' sklu
He dir not dare.
Somehow, for all of their general
ugliness, the toughs of Satan's ,Ch.
had come to leave Old Grim unmolest
ed.
They regarded him as a harmless old
hermit who somehow managed to live,
and they would have regarded it as a
disgrace to pick a quarrel with him.
But they made sport of Bold Billy
whenever the boy appeared in the
place.
One day Hank Bloodgood came into
Satan's Camp.
lie straightway started in for a rack
(1.
Tlhe liquor to be obtaineil in Satan's
('amp was rank, and Bloodgood was
soon fighting drunk.
lie had a record, and a long one, too.
More than one good man. as well as
more than one ruffian, had fallen be
fore Bloodgood's guns.
lie was not de-stined to get out of the
town without shedding blood.
The quarrel occurred in Murphy's,
and Bloodgood shot Red Hutch dead.
Then he started out to run the town,
and he ran It for awhile.
Satan's ('amp was not a place one
mnan could run long, however, and
Blloodgood was soon obliged to get out
or lose his scalp.
lie got out. but on his way out of
town he stopped long entough to shoot
O11 Grim.
Then lie went on his drunken course.
leaving a terrified boy weeping and
wailing over the body of the man who
had been so kind to him.
An hour later Bold Billy came rush
ing into Satan's ('amp.
In the greatest excitement he told
them what had happened, and then he
entreated them to purlsue the murderer
and bring him to justice.
Th'ey laughed at him.
They told him they were not tools.
Bloodgood was a "killer," and there
was no one who cared to follow him up.
When he found they would not go,
the boy literally screamed:
"You are all cowards-cowards
cowards! Give me a gun! I will fol
low and capture him!"
They laughed at the boy, but he re
peate~ over and over that he would
follow the assassin if he had a weapon.
,At length somebody shoved a revol
ver into his hand, saying:
"Here, ye hev it, kid; now see what
ye kin do. If you bring Hank Blood
good here with his hands tied behind
him, we'll agree to lynch him. Eh,
pards?"
"You bet!" cried the crowd. "Go fer
him, Bold Billy, an' make yerself fa
mous."
Not another word did the boy say.
With the loaded revolver clutched in
his hand, he hurried out of the camp
on the trail of Hank Bloodgood.
"Thet's the last we'll ever see o' Bold
Billy," some one declared. "He'd be
skeered ter death ter see Bloodgood.
You've lost your gun, Bolly."
"Mebbe," returned the man who had
loaned the boy the revolver.
At sunset a crowd of loafers were
gathered in front of Saint's Rest, the
only hotel in Satan's Camp.
Suddenly one of them exclaimed:
"Look thar, pards! Who's them com
In' down ther trailY'
"Two critters, one head o' t'other,"
said a red-whiskered ruffian. "Hands
hitched behind him, by thunder! Ga
loot in front is tied! See ther string
that runs ter t'other one? Holy Smoke!
It's-it's-why, it is-"
"Hank Bloodgood"'
"Shore's yer born!"
"Who's t'other critter?"
"I kinder reckon it's Bold Billy bring
in' back my revolver," said Bolly
Briggs, with grim satisfaction. "Who
said I woudn't ever see thet yar gun
ag'in?"
Bold Billy it was.
He had taken the "killer" captive.
Straight into town marched the boy
and his prisoner.
Billy's face was deathly pale.
Bloodgood's right hand had been
shattered by a bullet.
"Here is the man who killed Old
Grim, the only friend I had." sal the
The, his voe weak, as It from reat
exhaustion. "I have brought him hena
tied. Now keep your part of the agree
t ment."
HIe had stopped in front of Sa.t's
Rest as he uttered these words.
d Every loafer there was on his feet.
"Hooray fer Bold Billy!" cried one.
a "Derned ef he ain't done it, though I
dunno how he ever succeeded!"
Y "Wall. I kinder reckon we'll hey ter
e keep our part of the contract, elh
pards?" said BDly Briggs, as he came
0 down the steps
"That's rightr' shouted the crowd in
unison.
Three minutes later Hank Bloodgood,
S the "killer," was swinging from thq
s limb of a tree.
Hold Billy watched the work complet
ed. then he swayed, put out his hands,
s and fell in a senseless heap.
The men hastily bent over him.
"G(;reat snakes!" shouted Bolly Briggs,
r "lie's got two bullets in ther left shoul.
der' Hank done some shootin', but'
this yere boy took him all the same!"
"Whar's I)oc. Seldon?"
The doctor was on hand, full to the
chin with bad liquor, but still able to
extract a b)ullet.
The job was done., old Ililly's
t wounds were bathed and bandaged,
and he was taken to a nearby hbut.
I And there he lay for weeks, nursed
by the ruffians of Satan's ('amp-nursed
with all the care and tenderness possi
ble from masculine hands.
l)oc. Seldon attended the boy, and the
miners and roughs fixed it so the do'
tor could not get a suil of liquor in
the camp during the entire time.
From a street row or saloon brawl in
I which he had killed a man, a citizen
C of the pla.c, would go to his bedside
r of Ioldl illy and play the solicitous
nllrBo.
And the: pull,I-l the boy through.
Wlwn it was all over, with hold Billy
restored to health, they were all happy
that he disc'overed Old Grim's secret
-found the hermit's cabin was built
over the mouth of a rich lead-a paying
vein.
Satan's ('amp was proiud of him.
The rough and tough citizens stood
by him through thick and thin, and
when Bold hilly sold his mine and de
parted, all regretted his loss.
"He had sand in his craw." Bolly
Briggs was wont to say--"wall he did!
I saw it in his eyes when I let him hey
my gun. Do I know what became o'
him? Wall, I heard as how he went
ter 'Frisco. got inter business. married,
settled dlown. an' has some leetle Billies.

"The circumstances attending the.
death of Mrs. George Haven Putnam,
wife of the senior member of the well
known publishing house, are," says the
Critic. "particularly sad. Her husband
and two daughters were abroad when
she was taken ill. The former was
about to leave for home, the latter were
to remain abroad to finish their studies,
having just been graduated with honor
from Bryn Mawr. Mr. Putnam arrived
in New York Saturday last, the day aft
er his wife's death, the news of which
he was entirely unprepared for, her ill
ness from typhoid fever having been
very short as well as very severe. Mrs.
Putnam was most active in all reform
and philanthropic movements, and her
influence and practical Interest will be
sadly missed by all her associates. She
was a healthy-minded woman, and un
til her last illness she enjoyed the best
of physical health, too, if one may judge
by appearance. She was a woman of
sound common sense and cheerful dis
position, and her gracious presence
made many a dull occasion bright. Mr.
Putnam has the sympathy of a large
circle of friends in his severe bereave
ment."
