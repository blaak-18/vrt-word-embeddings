HE SHOWS UP THE NEFARIOUS 1
GOLDBUG SCHEME. 2
They Want Gold Declared the Universal t
Standard, and All Debts Payable in I
That 3Metal; to Retire All Greeambsks
sad Issue Gold Bonds for Them. ,
The free coinage of silver at the a
ratio Ili to 1. with gold is not all of a
the money question. The name of t
the new party, the Silver party. is not J
broad enough to represent the posi- v
tion of the true patriot on this qucs- t
tion. which is: (1) That all money f
shall be issued by the government c
and none by the banks. (2) That the a
volume of money shall be increased E
until prices are restored to a fair basis, c
and (3) That thereafter, from time to f
time or continually, additions shall be a
made to the volume of currecy, suffi
cient to meet the increasing needs of I
increasing population, production and
commerce. t
The free coinage of silver is at
means to these ends. By it the t
amount of money in circulation would c
speedily be very largely increased,
and it is probable that for many a
years silver would be coined ia large
quantities, if the mints of Europe re
mained closed to it. Under asystem i
of free coinage the lower the market t
price of the metal the more of it will a
be coined, for the simple reason that
every man who owned 4121 grains of
silver would carry it to the mint and I
have it coined into a dollar, rather 1
than sell It for 50, 765 or 90 cents. If
he could sell his 4121 grains of
silver on the market for $1 he would I
not trouble himself to go to the mint 1
and have it coined, if he could sell it a
for l1.05 he would certainly not have I
It coined into a dollar. So with gold:
whenever 25.$ grains of gold are
worth less than a dollar on the mar
ket gold will be coined, when worth
just a dollar, very little, if any. will t
be coined, and when worth more than
a dollar, none will be coined. These
are the three contingencies that may I
happen under the free coinage of ei
ther gold or silver, that is, the metal
may be (1) below par, or (2) at par,
or (8) above par.
And it is self-evident that is the
lfrst eontigency the metal will be
largely coined; in the second, little or
none of it will be coined; and in the
third, none will be coined; and not
only so, but should the metal go
much above par, that already coined
will be melted down and sold as bell.
ion. To have the free coinage of one
metal only. as at present, means
whenever that metal is above par, no
coinage at all that is, no addition to
the volume of metallic money, but, on
the other band, an actual decrease.
uuppose gold at a premium of 265
per cet, or in other words, the gold
in a teon-dollar gold coin worth $12.60
on the market, a rich man eomld get
together $10,000 in gold coin and
make $2,600 by melting it and sellinag
It for bulli6o.
Would no thbis, be done? Doubt
less, it has been, and this accounts in
part for the hundreds of millions of
gold ooi, which the treasury oedieals
say are 'n circulation, bet the larger
part of which cannot be found.
This Is the goal before their eyes.
They demn' say no, but the measures
they advocate do. The measure are:
(1) To have gold declared the uai
versal standard. (2) To make all ob
UJgasits. puabile nd private, payable
la gold. () To reti all the treas
ury ones now is existence (seppme* i
to be several hundred millions) and
to have bands of the U1ited State to
that amount Issued, payable, princi
pie and Intereest sn geld.

"'Sound Mosay' omeereaoe.
The great unterrified 'sound

were erexactly fifty-seven delegates
present, representing sixbeen towns,
seven of wvhich are l Icatsel in McLen

It was a wonderful meeting, and it
would have daoe Grower's soul good
to have been present and hear all of
them simultaslously say "cuckoo"
whenever their chief, George Clark
spoke. It was a ,"great" conference.
Of the fifty-mven delegates in st
tendance, there were twenty who are
well known copoeation lawyers-and
some of whom also hold national
bank stock. while the remsaing twea
ty-seven were either national bankers
or real estate pirates, exeopting afew
little felows from the country pre

know any better than to follow such
men as led tI the confoernce. They
passed resolutions coudemain fiasism,
opposed the coinage of silver at a
ratio of 16 to 1, and declared for a
dollar worth 100 cents all over the
world. This lest thought proves them

denounced fiat money (because they
were national bankers and sympas

SOME USEFUL FACTS.
L.DEMOT.4ETIZATION OF SILVER
A'°D EFFECT ON PRICES.
.Flam 'Itat Cam Not lie Ilajuted Nor

•1864 and 1893 Contrasted-Farmers
'Golng to the Wail.
"'ne world's product of gold in 18
.1b was $155,i450,00. In 1992 it had
:fallen to $138,961,00'). The gold
Ip:oduct in the United States was 965,
4It00,000 in 1853. In 1892 it had fallen
'to 33,000,000. Thus it will be seen
that the gold product of the United
States has decreased about one-half,
and that of the world is much less in
i the 40 years. Against this decline in
the gold product we find that the pop
ulation of the United States has in
creased during the time from 23.000,
000 to about 45,000,000, and the
'world's population has probably in
ireased in about the same ratio.
Now. through the influence of the
bond holding, banking and money
power of the world, silver has been
demonetized aad gold made the only
legal tender in payment of debts in
4l1 the leading commercial nations of
the earth. What is the natural re
ask?
Had the population and business of
the United States decreased one-hall
w. the past 40 years, as gold has, then
the value of gold and property would
hbave remained equal, but with the
population and business vastly in
creased and gold reduced one-half in
its annual production, besides the
present large output being used in
the arts and dentistry, it is no won
der that the demand for gold has im
mensely increased, and like any other
commodity, as the demand increases
the price goes up, and just in propor
tion as gold goes up all other prop
erty goes down.
Had the free coinage of silver and
its legal tender qualities not been de
stroyed, then our debt paying cur
rency would be double what it is now,
as the amount of silver coin and bull
ion in the world is about equal to
gold. To show the effects of a single
standard we submit the following
statistics:
In 1864. when we had plenty of
money, there were only 495 business
failures, footing up 6597,000;
while in 1893, with a scarcity of
money, we had 200,000 failures, ag
gregating 53.000,000,000.
Here are some figures worth saving,
as they are government statistics:

It will be noticed the price of
wheat, together with all cereals, has
been growing less each year. It will
also be noticed that with almost
twice the number of bushels of gross
production upon nearly three times
the number of acres of land that the
money received for the product was
mearly the same.
Sheep. hogs, eattle and horses have
depreciated in the same proportion,
while neither your notes nor interest,
your tax nor the salaries of your om.
clds have decreased a particle. So,
you see, it tahkes double the amount
of the products of your labor to liquid
ate your obligations.

One Ide of Money.
Money is a depository or resorvoir
of values, and this is one of its most
indispensable qualities. When a
man performs a week's service he is
entitled to the value of his earnings.
He desires it in a form that will sup
ply the necessities of himself and
family. The man whom he served
does not possess the desired com
modities, nor is it necessary that he
should. But be hands the laborer a
ten dollar note or coin. In either
form it is an order on general society
for value, and all men with values for
sale will be glad to honor that paper
or golden check. Usually in large
amounts they prefer the paper. El.

to the amount named, and every
owner of values is anxious to become

A PECULIAR CASE.
PHYSICIANS PUZZLED BY THE
EXPERIENCE OF MRS. BOWEN.
The Episcopal lHoopital Sali She lhad
Ounsumpt on.
(From the Recorl, Philadelphia. PI'.)
Last July the EpiscoTil h.1 I ittnl ald
mitted a woman whose pa,:l ar'l ,,mani
ated face and racking cough rpt .lainmed
her the victilni f (onsumlpt ln. She
gave her niam as srs. Wni. (;.
It,wan, resi.1. o,., 1S49 Melghan St.,
Philadelphia. The ca'·s was diag
nosed anol she was told plainly that
she was in an advanic. l state of c",,n
sumption. The examining physi'ian
even sho)wed her the sunken place in her
1r,.ast where the cavity in her lung was
supposed to exist. She went home to
her family, a broken, disheartened wom
an with d(lath staring her in the fac',.
That was the beginning of the st,.ry, the
end as told by Mrs. IBowen. who no
longer expects to die, to a reporter ft.o
lows:
"The first symptoms of consumption
came in the form of terrible sweats,
night and day. From April until
September I wns constantly cold and
kept wrapped up in blankets throughi
the hottest weather. A terrible cough
took possession of me, my breast was
sore to the slightest touch, and my
limbs were like cold clay. The hardest
rubbing with the coarsest towel would
not create the slightest flush, and the
least exertion would exhaust me.
"I went to the hospital in July and
they diagnosed my case as above stat
ed. It was when the clouds were the
darkest that the first glint of sunshine
came. Mr. Shelmerdine,. a friend, who
lives around at 1844 Clementine St., said
to me one day, Mrs. Bowen did you ever
try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
People. I had never heard of the medi
cine, but In my condition could not turn
a deaf ear to anything that offered re
lief. It was after considerable thought
and investigation that I concluded to
discontinue all other medicine, in
cluding cod liver oil, and depend
entirely upon Pink Pills. I began to
take the pills, at first with but little en
rouragement, The first sign of improve
ment was a warmth and tingling sen
sation in my limbs. Finally the cough
disappeared, my chest lost its soreness
and I began to gain flesh until I was
fifteen pounds heavier. All this I owe
to Dr. Williams' Pink Pills and I cannot
praise them too highly."
Mrs. Bowen is a kindly faced lady no
middle age, a church member, well
known and highly esteemed. She looks
today well and strong and it seems al
most impossible that she was ever given
up by eminent physicians as an in
curable consumptive. Yet such is the
case beyond all dispute.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain all
the elements necessary to give new life
and richness to the blood and restore
shattered nerves. They are for sale by
all druggists, or may be had by mall
from Dr. Williams' Med. Co., Schenec
tady, N. Y.. for 50c. per box, or WIs
boxes for M50.
Worth of a lDimoe
A dime of 1829 is worth but its face
value, from purchaser's standpoint;
dealers charge for such from 25 cents
'.1 60 cents. A dime of 1839 or one
of 1840 is worth to sell only its
(ace value. The dime of 1839 having
on the obverse the letters O. P. is
sold by dealers at from 30 to 65 cants.
A &8-eat piece of 1867 sells for 75
cents to $1: dealers pay from 20 cents
to 35 cents for such. A half-franc of
1861 has no special value. Dealers
lo not purchase half-dollars of 1829,
but sell them from 75 cents to 1f.
Where the figure 29 is stamped over
