“OUR TOM.”
“Half the time Tom Watson does
n’t know what he is writing,” says
the Johnstown Democrat. But you
can not make people who have wres
tled with the anti-Tom end of an ar
gument believe it!—Washington, D.
C., Herald.
KEEP AN EYE ON ALASKA.
Forty years ago only the far-sighted
possessed even the remotest concep
tion of the possibilities of Alaska.
It was in 1867 that this vast tract
of land on the northwest shoulder of
the continent was acquired by the
United States government from Rus
sia. The sum paid was $7,200,000' in
gold, and the purchase was negotiated
by William H. Seward, who then held
the office of Secretary of State in
President Johnson’s cabinet. To the
average American citizen, without
regard to party lines, there seemed
to be little to commend the purchase
of such an enormous area of waste
land.
Perhaps no single investment which
the government has ever made called
forth harsher criticism at the time
than this acquisition of Alaska.
Why should we annex icebergs and
Eskimos ?
This was the question asked on all
sides.
And no doubt the advocates of the
purchase were influenced much more
by the fear of international complica
tions than by the hope of large reve
nues.
But the fact is that the enormous
receipts of the Alaskan fur trade
alone have defrayed the cost of the
territory many times over.
Then add to this sum the value of
the Alaskan fisheries.
‘More than ten years have elapsed
since the discovery of the yellow metal
in the Klondike region. Since then
vast quantities of gold have been
mined; and today Alaska ranks next
to Colorado in the amount of gold an
nually produced. This is shown from
the mining output of the past year.
Colorado is credited with an output
worth $22,800,000 and is followed by
Alaska with an output worth $20,-
900,000.
But when we take into considera
tion the belt of population which sur
rounds the Centennial State and the
extent to which the mining interests
are exploited, it is very doubtful if we
have even begun to unearth the buried
treasure of Alaska.
Despite the extreme northern lati
tude of this great territory, it pos
sesses an ideal summer climate and in
many places the weather conditions
are not too rigorous even in mid
winter.
Within the next twenty-five years
very great changes are destined to
take place in this corner of the map.

GEORGE T. ANGELL.
I regret to see by recent press dis
patches that Mr. George T. Angell,
the great Humanitarian, is dead.
Few men have lived to as good a
purpose as did Mr. Angell, who will
be missed by all lovers of animal and
bird creation.
Though a devout Christian in his
way, Mr. Angell did not devote all his
energies in the work of saving souls.
He had due respect for the body and
sought in every possible way to give
protection to those dumb animals and
birds, but for whose presence and
companionship human existence would
be a failure. His religion was not of
the persecuting kind and he did not
go around all questions giving rise
to doubt and uncertainty. I find
among my clippings a short piece
which illustrates the candor charac
teristic of the man. Headed 11 Robin
son Crusoe,” it ran thus:
When Robinson Crusoe found him
self on an uninhabited island he im
mediately set to work to do the best
he could under the circumstances.
We find ourselves in this world
without choice of our own.
Whence we came from we do not
know.
Whether we have had any prior ex
istence we do not know.
Exactly where each of us will go
when we leave this world we do not
know’.
We find it a world of mixed good
and evil —happiness and suffering.
Now what is the wise thing to do?
We answer—-strive to make it as
happy a world as we can —strive to
lessen evil —strive to lessen suffering 1
—strive to stop every form of cruelty
and crime.
Strive, in the words of the seal of
our American Humane Education So
ciety, for “Glory to God,” “Peace
on Earth,” “Kindness, Justice and
Mercy to every living creature.”—-

HIS LUCID ANSWERS.
They were asking the eminent law
yer why he took so large a fee from
the Trust.
“I think it was its largeness that
made it easy to take,” he smilingly
answered.
Then the State’s attorneys con
ferred.
“And didn’t you stop to consider
that the money was tainted?” they
asked him.
“No,” he ingeniously replied, “I
only stopped to count it.”
This closed the proceedings for the
day. —Cleveland Plain Dealer.

NO EXCUSE.
Mrs. Hockafus —The idea of your
buying a kitchen bellows! What use
on earth have you for such a thing
as that?

I have any use for it, Lucinda. I sup
