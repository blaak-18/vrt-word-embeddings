VI the Rapid March of Events In tb

Think of this u11(ch of events' It
was iarely eight years :l' t1at thl
goldfields of the Klondike were IrI?'u(ht

Important business for the Puget sound
ports, where the miners outtated and
took ship. Following the Klondike ex
citemnCut came the various Alaska dis
coveries. and Seattle and Tiloma were
and are the natural headquarters for
most of the supplies shipped northward
as well as the entry point for the re
turning miners with their treasure, not
a little of which is left to enrich the
people of ti' , arts.
Hardly 11d tile gold excitement calm
ed to tiei( paces of a stendy business
enterprise when the Spanish war broke
out, and these Pacific titles were
thrown into tle turmoil of visiting hat
tleships and of provisioning and trans
porting the army of the Philippines.
Then came the opening trade with our
new insular Possessions in the Pacific.
the Chinese war and its call for equip
ment and its stir of soldiery and trans
ports. followed by the recent comner
cial expansion of Japan, with its trade
demands. And now an element ha1s
just entered into the calculations of the
coast-the construction of the Panama
canal-which will revolutionize whole
departments of the world's trade and
exercise a profound influence for good
or evil on the cities of the northwest
ern ennist.
Many of the events, it is true, nota
bly the opening of the door to the far
east, are mostly promissory assets, and
yet their prophecy of a golden future
has not been without its effect on the
growth of the Pacific cities and the at
traction of energetic men and money.
To the Pacific ports will ultimately
come most of the trade of the Philip
pines, worth $60,000,000 annually, and
a growing share of the $1,000,000,000
or more of the annual business of
China, Japan, Siberia and the Dutch
East Indies, to say nothing of the large
foreign trade of Australia and New
Zealand. Alaska, once regarded as a
hopelessly distant and irreclaimable
waste of mountains and snow, is also
progressing with wonderful rapidity,
not only in its mines, but in the de
velopment of its fisheries and in the
utilisation of its forests and its agri
cultural resources, so that today the
Alaskan trade is of much importance.
While these world events were
crowding upon one abother the devel
opment of the country tributary to the
coast, upon which the solid progress of
the cities must ultimately rest, was go
ing forward with unprecedented rapid
ity. Western Canada was opening to
settlement, Is opening now in a mar
velous manner; railroads were build
ing, schemes for irrigating the arid
lands were in course of development,
crop production was increasing, timber
was being cut from an almost inex
haustible supply to supplement the
waning forests of Maine and Michigan,
coal mines were being opened and
salmon caught, all the forces of indus
try working together with a rapidity
which must always remain a world's
wonder.-Ray Stannard Baker in Cen
tury.
Medlesa Theory Is ladis.
While in Pittsburg recently Dr. Ber
tha Caldwell of India told some good
anecdotes on the doctors of that coun
try. One day she was riding in the
cars with a Mohammedan doctos. She
asked him what kind he was--an allo
pathist, a homeopathist or an osteo
path. He answered, "I don't know."
Dr. Caldwell asked him how he prac
ticed and what kind of medicine he
gave. Opening up a box he carried, he
exhibited seven bottles containing liq
uids of all the colors of the rainbow.
"You see," said the Mohammedan
doctor, "fever makes the patient red,
and then I give him red medicine. A
cold makes him blue, and then I give
him blue medicine. If he is bilious, he
Is yellow, and then I give him yellow
medicine." And thus he went on to the
end. She remarked, "You must be a
homeopathist."
"Imagine my amusement," said Dr.
Caldwell, "when, on walking down the
street the next day, I saw this sign in
front of the doctor's door: "Gee-ul-whiz,
Servant of God, Homeopathist."-Pitts.

Zola, who used his pen on others as
a dissecting knife, submitted himself
some years ago to a detailed medical
examination in the general interests of
anthropology, frankly recognizing the
fact that Max Nordan saw in him an
excellent illustration of his theory of
the connection between genius and de
generacy. Not all those observations
or his own answes to questions about
himself were published during his life,
but there is now no need for reticence.
He had a wrinkled forehead when he
was six, he had "morbid ideas" until he
was thirty-five, and then, when sue
came in at the door, they escaped
b, the window. With his intellectual
power went a lack of nervous equilib

and tenacity of purpose, he had feeble
powers of conce tration and attention

THE HOUSE SURGEON.
He Is a Boon and a Blessing to
Guests In Big Hotels.
All the principal hotels in New York
employ a house surgeon. They do not
pay him a salary, but merely provide
him with a sleepiniz apartmniet aid of
fice. In return he Ireats the ills and
aches of the stafl. from the heid men
down to the kithhenmni h. This is not
a particularly easy tast. as there are

rapidity that would give nervous pros

not lit him to cope with just such eon
tingencies, says the New York Ti oes.
To the hotel guests the hatse simrgeoim
is a necessity. Transients from out of
town frequently need his services.

his tnaiity leap. te alti In ihe all
things to all men. When his patient
happens to be a rabid lo::-ii'ti;t,
he does not air his privatet views on
the supei'iority of aii'piithy, or vice
versa.
But it is when an attempt at suicide
is made that the house surgeon is most
useful. Accidents of this kind will,
sometimes ecur in the best regulated
hotels, and if the attempt is discovered
within a reasonable time the heroic
efforts that are made to save the man
or woman are frequently successful.
The surgeon arrives on the scene
with the least possible delay. In the
midst of all the fuss, worry and ex
citement he is calm and capable. and
his skillful hands often bring back the
patient from the shadow of death. Hle
is discretion itself, and it sometimes
happens that the frustrated attempt to
die never reaches the public ear.
His position is profitable and pleas
ant. If he is not naturally courteous,
adaptable and of good address, he
quickly acquires these qualities. He
dresses in the best taste and is seen in
the dining rooms and along the corri
dors of the hotel. In this way he be
comes a familiar figure to the guests,
and it gives them a feeling of security
to know that he is within reach to min
ister to their physical ailments, real or
imaginary, 'whenever they choose to
send for him.
The house surgeon never has to wor
ry about bad debts, as have his less
fortunate brethren. The hotel manage
mnent charges for his services in its
regular bill and sees to it that the prop
er fee is forthcoming. - Detroit Free
Press.
Avoidiag the Mule's Heels.
A prosperous Chicago business man
in the lobby of the Fifth Avenue hotel
told how he had occasion recently to
visit a friend who was an inmate of
an Institution for the care of victims of
the drink habit.
"While chatting with my friend in
the general reading and smoking
room," said he "a young man, pale and
shaky, entered and took a seat on the
opposite side of the room.
"Presently he arose from his chair,
tiptoed across the room, making a wide
sweep and closely examined a hatrack
near the door. Without a word he
sneaked back to his seat, again careful
to avoid the center of the floor. In a
few minutes he repeated these tactics,
slipping with great caution over to the
hatrack and back and avoiding the cen
ter of the room. On the third trip*a
fellow patient asked him why he was
so anxious about the hatrack and what
there was to shy at on the floor. In
the most intense and solicitous accents
came this reply:
"'Well, didn't you fellows see that
mule, shod with derby hats, come in
the door and across the room? Blame
him! I wanted to see whether he had
my hat. I don't want any tool mule
walking around with my new hat on
his off hind hoof. I shied out of the
way when I went to the hatrack be
cause I didn't want to get within range
of his heels. I believe he's shod with
my hat, after all.' "-New York Mail
and Express.
An Archbishop's Savings.
The will of the late archbishop of
Canterbury clearly proves that the day
when bishops used to amass huge for
tunes is past. Dr. Temple left only
£1,SA00, a sum which represents but
slightly more than his income as arch
bishop for one year. There is certain
ly no profession in England other
than the church in which a man of Dr.
Temple's ability, who worked like a
slave for nearly sixty years, would
have made so little monfy. His prede
cessor, Archbishop Benson, left almost
twice as much - viz, £33.000, which,
oddly enough, is also the sum left by
Archbishop Tait. The largest fortune
left by any bishop of late years was
the £72,000 which Dr. Walsham How
bequeathed.-London Tatler.
Keep Young In Spirit.
Perhaps Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy Is
right in saying that we ought to ignore
birthdays and give no heed to the pass
ing years. We imagine. however, this is
easier for Christian Scientists to do than
for those of us who are so unothereal
as to be compelled to face the stubborn
facts of life. It is true, however, that.
we ought not to measure age simply
by the year of our birth. One may bey
old at twenty-five or young at sev"retr.
It is largely a matter of the spiri.-
