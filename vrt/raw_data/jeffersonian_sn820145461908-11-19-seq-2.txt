THE NATIONAL RESULT.
The Republicans have won another
national victory. The people have
again chosen between the two leading
parties. The People’s party has
maintained its identity and its honor.
What vote Watson and Williams re
ceived will not be known until the
official returns are opened. The vote
is doubtless small, though the privi
pies of the party are favored by mil
lions. In only about a dozen States
were there Watson and Williams
presidential electors, and in but one
State (Georgia) was there much of
a campaign made.
It seemed the Bryan business had
to run its course before the Populists
could rally again, and it may be the
people cannot be aroused until the
bank loan prosperity collapses.
However, word comes from all sec
tions from reformers that they will
keep up the fight and are hopeful. A
letter received just as we go to press
contains a contribution for the cam
paign fund of 1912.
Mr. Watson gave notice some
weeks ago that he would call a con
ference soon after the election with
the view of reorganizing for 1912.
As for the editor of the World he
will die fighting the money-power.
The ease of peace, obtained by sur
render, has no attraction for us. It
is victory for reform or a fight until
we are called hence.
The people as a whole have been
converted to the principles of the
People’s party.
The Populist position on money and
railroads would be approved by a
large majority if submitted to a
referendum vote. Upon this fact do
we base our hope that the reform
movement will win.—Missouri World.
THE COAL SUPPLY.
The Government geological survey
has recently issued a bulletin to the
effect that the country need have no
fear of the exhaustion of its coal
supply at least for several hundred
years to come. It is stated that we
had to start with in the coal meas
ures of the United States in the
neighborhood of 3,157,243,000,000
short tons, and of this we have only
used up to January 1, 1903, about
6,865,097,567 tons, which, with the
waste at the mines, total 10,000,000,-
000 tons. Just how the survey reach
ed the result its figures show with
such nicety is not given with any
satisfactory definiteness, but there
seems to be very good ground for be
lieving that notwithstanding the enor
mous output now annually demanded
of the mines there will be no famine
during the lifetime of any one now
living.
In fact there are immense fields
now lying unopened and undeveloped,
constituting a very nearly inexhaus
tible reserve supply upon which fu
ture generations may draw without
fear of limitation. These assurances
from official authority while, of
course, largely estimates, will serve
to quiet the apprehension of those
timid people who cannot think cound
ly in more than seven or eight figures.

LIKE GIVING IT TO THE
CHURCH.
How proud a Republican farmer
must feel when he plunks down $125
cold cash for that American binder
the Canadian farmer can buy for S4O
less money after freight is paid.
Why, it’s like giving money to the
church! It’s almost safe to assume
that some Northern millionaire will
give one cent out of that 4,000 cents
some day to build a church or theo
logical seminary in Boston or to teach
Latin and Greek to the negroes down
South. —Page News.

PREVAILING OUTLAWRY.
Is the “Night Riding” outlawry a
result of the financial panic?
When big thieves, yclept “finan
circus, ” rob a nation, why not small
dastards get busy?
Why should there be favoritism as
between the fellow who burns your
gin if you do not hold your cotton
and the fellow who sends up the
price of money by removing his bil
lions from activity, so that he may
load up with your depressed values
and unload in time with his inflated
ones ?
If this is not the actual case, where
—in what part of the earth —has the
ground ceased to yield her bounty?
On what substantial basis is the
“financial stringency*’ explained, ex
cept as the “Night Rider” might ex
plain the high price of cotton if he
could have it all withdrawn from the
market.
From what I hear among business
associates, the mania of dishonesty is
rampant. Os my own knowledge, I
have known citizens, who go about
wearing an immense fodder-chest of
importance and responsibility, try to
throw down the simplest little obliga
tions, knowing that they owe them. .
Dear old Rockefeller, having to
atone in that blissful heaven he
teaches about in his Sunday school
class of sycophancy, will have to an
swer for a great many crooks of his
making when he reaches “Up Yon
der. ’ ’ —The Harlequin.
THE CRUELTY OF THOUGHT
LESSNESS.
Most of the cruelty of the world
is thoughtless cruelty. Very few peo
ple would intentionally add to an
other’s load or make his burden in
life heavier or his path rougher. Most
of the great heart wounds are in
flicted by thoughtless thrusts, flung
out often in a moment of anger, when
perhaps we were too proud to apolo
gize or to try to heal the grievous
wounds we had made.
Can anything be more cruel than to
discourage a soul who is struggling to
do the best he can, to throw stumbling
blocks in the path of those who are
trying to get on in the world against
great odds?
No life is just the same after you
Xsl»e. 3effersonlan
have once touched it. Will you have
a ray of hope or one of despair, a
flash of light or a somber cloud across
some dark life each day? Will you
by thoughtless cruelty deepen the
shadow which hangs over the life, or
will you by kindness dispel it alto
gether? No matter how you feel or
what is disturbing your peace of
mind, never allow yourself to send
out a discouraging, a cruel or an un
kind word or thought.—Success Miaga
zine.
THE MAN-GOD.
From form to form the spirit bids us
climb,
Through round on round of strife, of
sorrow and of sleep,
As up the valley of forgotten time
Insensibly we creep.
Slowly, how slowly! From the primal
shape,
The sensient tube, the fish that darts
on glassy fin,
The lizard, the keen fox, the hound,
the ape,
Slowly our way we win.
From ape to savage man another
stride,
And then the shepherd, and at last
the man of toil,
The hand that-strips the mountains
of their pride,
The master of the soil;
The artisan of cities and of dreams,
The architect of tombs that last from
age to age;
The harnesser of winds, of clouds, of
streams,
The ruler and the sage.
Yet, deep within our souls there lies a
dream
Which brings its own fulfilment, and
that Power vast
Which shaped us to the universal
scheme
Shall guide us to the last.
We are not that alone which now we
are
But that we are to be; into the sky
of Time
Above the verge of Night our being’s
star
Has scarce begun to climb.
—Robert R. Logan, in July Forum.
WORKER MUST LOVE VOOA
TION.
A prime qualification for success
in any art, trade or profession is the
love of it, though love alone will by
no means bring success in it. The
love must be reciprocal; that is, the
vocation must desire its follower, for
reasons which must remain ias much
a mystery to him as to any of his
witnesses. “She was love-worthy,”
says Heine, in treating of a more
passional case, “and he loved her;
but he was not love-worthy, and she
loved him not.” The fond youth, uni
versity bred or self-made, may have
ever so great a desire for journalism,
but journalism will have no resize for
him, unless he has the peculiar charm
for it which commands affection in all
cases. He can only prove the fact
by trying and by longing to try with
a longing that excludes the hope of
every other reward besides the favor
of the art he wishes to espouse.
Riches, fame, power may be in the
event, but they are not to be in the
quest. The wish to succeed in it for
its own sake must be his first motive,
and the sense of success in it must
be left to add themselves, without his
striving for them. So far as he strives
for them, they will alloy and dilute
his journalistic success. —W. D. How
ells, in Harper’s Magazine.

THE OLD MAID.
In almost every circle of our kin
dred there has been some queen of
self-sacrifice to whom jeweled hand
was offered in marriage, but who
stayed on the old place because
of the sense of filial obli
gation until the health was gone
and the attractiveness of per
sonal presence had vanished. Brutal
society may call such a one by a
nickname. God calls her daughter,
and heaven calls her saint.
We like to sing the praises of the
sisterhood who remain unmarried that
they might administer to aged par
ents. The world calls these self-sacri
ficing ones peculiar or angular, but if
you had had as many annoyances as
they have had Xantippe would have
been an angel compared with you. It
is easier to take care of five rollick
ing, romping children than one child
ish old man. Among the best women
are those who allowed the bloom of
life to pass away while they were
earing for their parents. While other
maidens were sound asleep they were
soaking the old man’s feet or tucking
up the covers around the invalid
mother. While other maidens were
in the cotillion they were dancing at
tendance upon rheumatism, and
spreading plasters for the lame back
of the septuagenarian, and heating
catnip tea for insomnia.
Let the ungrateful world sneer at
the maiden aunt, but God has a
throne burnished for her arrival, and
on one side of that throne in heaven
there is a vase containing two jewels,
the one brighter than the Kohinoor
of London Tower, and the other
larger than any diamond ever found
in the districts of Golconda —the one
jewel by the lapidary of the palace
cut with the words, “Inasmuch as ye
did it to father,” the other jewel by
the lapidary of the palace cut with
the words, “Inasmuch as ye did it to
mother.”—Dodson Times.
