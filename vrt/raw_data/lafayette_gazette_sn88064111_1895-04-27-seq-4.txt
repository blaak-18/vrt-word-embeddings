THE MAGIC SWING.
ems or the pst.rtss of :the caf u a/o.
Plar nszpaased..
A magic swing attracted much at
tention at the last midwinter fair In
an Franociseo. The visitor was ushered
Into a chamber which 'contained the
swing, a kind of platform with seats
hanging from a bar let into the walls,
as shown in our illustration. When
the seats were all oeccupied by visitors
the attendant closed the door and gave
a slight oscillation to the swing. Pres
ently the oscillations grew larger and
larger, until at length the swing
mounted to the ceiling and went right
over the bar, as pictured. The passen
gers, however, felt no discomfort of
any kind, and their surprise was the
greater in that between the, bar and

THE MAGIC 'SWING.
the ceiling there was apparently no
room for the swing to pass. At last
the oscillations diminished, and the
swing came to rest. The effect was
really an optical illusion, similar to
that experienced on seeing a railway
train gliding past the train in which
we are seated, and causing us to think
that ours is moving at the same speed.
The swing itself did not turn round the
bar, but the chamber turned round
the swing, and the illusion was so
perfect that the occupants involun
tarily clutched their seats at the turn
over to avoid being thrown out. The
furniture of the room, including what
purported to be a kerosene lamp, but
was in reality electric, and could be
inverted without danger, was all de
signed to keep up the illusion, which
was further helped by a baby's peram
bulator and a chair with a hat on it.

ADVICE TO INVENTORS.
The Wisdom of Pinding Out what Others
lavre Done.
Inventors may be roughly divided in
to three classes: (1) Those who, as the
result of accident and momentary in
spiration, think out one or two devices
having no special relation to their ordi
n,ý ,p'-:r,it' needs; (2) persons
who, ha,.c r efined mechanical
giri, :1 ,-- .-- ularly employed in
sm,' . nnuufata.., " trade, and a good
de:i '-ie to h':. u-a of tools and the
' ., I'.b.e ,t s incidental to me
.-...i. s, and (3) experts in electricity,
steam-engineering, steel and Iron
works, or some other industry, who are
constantly employed by some one else
at a salary to improve existing methods
and appliances. The first two of these
classes, together constituting ninety
nine per cent. of the whole, may be
called, without disrespect or disparage
ment, amateur inventors. Those con
stituting the third set are really "pro
fessional inventors." Some excellent
suggestions, offered to the latter in
Engineering Magazine, by Henry Har
rison Suplee, deserve consideration by
the former.
This writer's first recommendation is
that when a man gets an idea he go to
work and find out what others have
done in the same direction, so that he
will not discover, after throwing away
a lot of labor and time, and perhaps
money, that some one else has tried the
same thing and succeeded, or has tried
and failed. All failures should be care
fully studied, so that the reasons there
for can be detected and a repetition
avoided. It is well to collect facts,
either in the form of clippings or writ
ten memoranda, copies of patents or
manufacturers' catalogues, about other
devices like that which the inventor has
in mind. Above all, it is important
that a man, before trying to solve a
problem, carefully inquire whether it
is worth solving. Merchants, manu
facturers and consumers should be con
sulted, to see whether a thing would
sell, if perfected and put on the mar
ket. Finally, mechanical laws, means
of accomplishing an end simply with
out waste of power or material and
fundamental principles should be ea
gerly and thoroughly studied, in books,
by personal observation and by in
quiry. It is the inventor who works
along these lines and looks upon inven
tion as a science and not as a hap-haz
ard affair who makes the greatest hits
commercially.
low a Toad Wra SplUced.
The astonishtng possibility of build
ing up living animals from parts of
several animals has been demonstrated
by Dr. C. Born, a German physiologist.
The experiments were made with tad
poles and other larvae of amphibions.
Each of these was cut in two and dif
ferent parts were placed together m
various ways, when some of them
united, the hinder more readily than
the fore parts. Two hinder parts, each
with or without a heart, united in 24
hours, the monstrosity living and grow
ing for a week or more. A built-up
larva having the fore part of a toad and
the hinder part of a frog, or vice versa,
was easily produced. Larvae of dif
ferent genera were joined by the bel
lies, moreover, with such success that
it seemed possible that the doublet
might be grown into a green frog, hav
ing a black toad with red-spotted belly
on its under side.-Invention.
Internal Temperature of Trees.
The internal temperature of trees is
the subject of study upon which i.
Prinze, of Uecle, Belgium, has been en
raged for some time. He says that the
mean annual temperature of the heart
of trees is exactly that of the surround
ing air, but that the mean monthly
temperature may vary from two to
three degrees of the centigrade ther
anometer.

SELL'S PHOTOPHON. -
./ephegiaes wsathot a wire sad 1ashaIe
Aleor a Be-am of Light.
lnthe last few years, in connection
i with Mr. Preeo's experiments in Eng
land and otherwise, we have heard a
Sgood deal abodi telegraphing without
n wires. It has also been found practic.
I able to telephone without wires. In
0 the former operation induction is the
a means employed; in the latter, ap
, paratus invented by Prof. Bell, the
a author of the telephone, and called the
a "photophog-e." Nelson W. Perry de
e scribes it in a recent number of Eloc
i tricity. Light emanating from any
d source, L, is passed through a lens, A,
W in order to render its rays parallel, be
fore they fall upon the mirror,B,whence
- they are refleeted to a parabolio mirror,
SD, in whose focus is placed a piece of
e selenium, B. The selenium forms part
of the circuit of a telephone, T, oper
ated by a battery, F.
The mirror B is composed of a very
thin sheet of glass or mica, silvered on
its face, and mounted so as to vibrate
like a telephone diaphragm when a
person speaks into the mouthpiece, C,
behind it. Now, when the tones of the
voice cause the diaphragm to bulge
forward, the rays reflected toward D
will diverge slightly instead of being
parallel, and less light iill be concen
trated upon E; but when, at the other
stage of any, vibrations, the plate is
rendered concave, the rays will con
verge, and more light will be thrown
upon the selenium. As the electrical
conductivity of this remarkable sub
stance varies in proportion to the
amount of light to which it Is sub
jected, the intensity of the telephone
current will be modified thereby, and
the telephone itself will distinctly re
produce the words uttered in the
mouthpiece C. It is not stated at how
great a distance this apparatus will
work; but it will be seen that therein a
beam of light takes the place of the
ordinary metallic connections between
the two instruments.
Since Bell accomplished the result
here described, Mr. Perry says, Tainter
has substituted soot for the selenium,
and dispensed with the battery alto
gether, using instead of the ordinary
telephone receiver the two-pronged
hearing tube, by means of which one
listens to a phonograph. As so con
structed, Mercadier calls the instument
a "radiophone." In the apparatus per
fected by Richards, a pellet of burned
cork in a bulb at the end of a small
glass tube is placed in the focus at E,
and the other end of the glass connects
with the rubber hearing tube. It is
well known that when light falls upon
a substance which does not reflect all
the rays, that which is absorbed is
turned into heat. Of course lusterless
black isa high absorbent. In the radio
phone the fluctuations of light inten
sity are attended by rapid but minute
alterations of temperature. The heat
received expands both .the particles of
carbon and the air in the interstices;
and the cooling contracts them. This
compression and rarefaction have been
found adequate to excite sound vibra
tions in the adjacent air in the glass
tube, although articulate speech is not
yet very faithfully reproduced.
BRICK DUST MORTAR.
alaid to Be an Excellent Saubtitute foi
tydraulle Cement.
The use of brick dust mortar as a
substitute for hydraulic cement, where
the latter cannot be obtained, is now
recommended, the Southern Architect
says, on the best engineering author
ity, experiments made with mixtures
of brick dust and quicklime showing
that blocks of one-half inch in thick
n "s. after immersion in water for four
months, bore without crushing, crum
bling, or splitting, a pressure of 1,500
pounds per square inch. It is consid
ered, too, that the addition of even as
small a*proportion as one-tenth as
much brick dust as sand to ordinary
mortars is preventive of the disintegra
tion so often characterizing mortars
used in the masonry of public works.
The use of brick dust mixed with lime
and sand is said to be generally and
successfully practiced in the Spanish
dominions, and is stated to be in all re
spects superior to the best Rosendal
hydraulic cement in the construction
of culverts, drains, tanks, or cisterns,
and even roofs, whether for setting flat
tiles or for making the usual tropical
flat roof. The proportions used there
in the manufacture are, approximately,
one of brick dust, one of lime and two
of sand, mixed together dry and tem
pered with water in the usual way.
Gold Contailned ina Sea Water.
Prof. Lobley believes that all the
gold now found in the rocks and sand
was deposited there from solution in
sea water. In support of this theory it
is said that sea water contains a little
less than a grain of gold per ton, ac
cording to which estimate the sea con
tains 5,000,000 times more gold than
has ever been extracted from the rocks.

Cadwel, N. I., March 1iS WS.-(_peba.)
Since one of our prominea lbtlans-sugered
so terribly from tobacco temens, has made
mknown his frightful experience in behilf of
humanity the ladits here are making tobo
co-using husbands' lives merable with
their entreaties to at once quit tobacco.
The written statement of S. J. Gould is
ttrati wide-.spread attention. When in
terviewed to-night be said: "I commenced
-uslg toacoo at thirteen; I am now folrtl
nine; so, for thirty-six years I cbe
smoked, snuffed and rubbed snuit.
In the morning I chewed before I put my
pants on, sa for a long time I used two
ounces of niewlng and eight ounces of
smoking a day. Sometimes I had chew
in both cheeks and a pipe in my mouth at
once. Ten years ago I quit drinking whisky.
I tried to stop tobacco time and again, but
could not. My nerves oraved ~ laotinoeand
fed them, till my skin turned a tobacco
brown, codticky perspiration oozed from
my skin, ad trickled down my back at the
least exertion orexcitement. Mynerve vigor
and my life was- beingslowly sapped. I made
up my mind that I had to quit tobacco or
die. On October 1 I stopped and for three
days I sa red the tortures of the damned.
On the third day I got so bad that my pt
nor accused me of being drunk. I aid ,No
I have quitobacco.' 'ForGod'ssake, man,
he said, offering me his tobacco box, 'take a
chew; you will go wild,' and I was wild.
Tobacco was forced inteo me and I was taken
homedazed. I saw double and my memory
was beyond control, but I still knew how
to chew and smoke, which I did all day un
til towards night, when my system got
tob.acco-soakle ngnin. The next morning!
loooked andifelt acs though I had been through
a long spell of sickness. I gave up in de
spair, as I thought that I could not cure my
self. Now, for suffering humanity, I'll tell
what saved my life. Providence evidently
answered my good wife's prayers and
brought to her attention in our paper an ar
ticle which read: 'Don't Tobacco Spit and
Smoke Your Life Away !'
"What a sermon and warning in these
words! Just what I was doing. It told
about a guaranteed cure for the tobacco
habit, called No-To-Bac. I sent to Drug
gist Hasler for a box. Without a grain of
faith I spit out my tobacco cud, and put
into my mouth a little tablet upon which
was stamped No-ToBac. 1 know it sounds
like a lie when I tell you that I took eight
tablets the first day seven the next five the
third day, and all the nerve-creeping feel
Ing, restlessness and mentaldepression was
gone. It wastoo good to be true. It semed
like a dream. That was a month ago. I
used one box. It cost me $1, and it is worth
a thousand. I gained ten pounds in weight
and lost all desire for tobacco from the first
day. I sleep and eat well and I have been
benefited in more ways than I can tell. No,
the cure was no exception in my case. I
know of ten people right here in Caldwell
who have bought No-ro-tBac from Hasler,
and they have been cured. Now that I rea
lize what No-To-Bac has done for me and
others, I know why it is that the makers of
this wonderful remedy the Stcrling Itern
edy Compauy, of New Yiork and Chicago,
say: WTt e don't claim to cure every case.
That's Fraud's talk, a lie; but we do guar
antee three boxes to cure the tobacco habit,
and in case of failure we are perfectly will
to refund money.' I would not give a
public indorsement if I-were not certain of
its reliabilityv. I know it is backed by men
worth a million. No-To-Bac has been a
God-send to me, and I firmly believe it will
cure any case of tobacco using if faithfully
tried, and there are thousands of tobacco
slaves who ought to know how easy it is to
get free. There's happiness in No-To-Bac
for the prematurely old men, who think as
I did that they are old and worn out. when
tobacco is the thing that destroys their vi
tality and manhood."
The public should be warned, however,
againsr. the purchase of any of the many
Imitations on the market, as the success of
No-To-Bac has brought forth a host of
counterfeiters and Imitators. The genuine
No-To-Bac is sold under a guarantee to
oure, by all druggists, and every tablet has
the word No-To-Bac plainly stamped there
on, and you run no physical or financial
risk in purchasing the genuine article.

SCOTCH FARM WORKERS.
The Claw That Has uarnished Many Emi
neat Men.
The agricultural laborers of Scot
land are, as a class, healthy and tem
perate; they receive small wages. The
Scottish peasantry have played an im
portant part in the development of
their nation. They are thrifty, re
ligious, and well educated-thanks to
the facilities for education provided
for them through the liberality of the
church of Scotland. It is from this
class that many of Scotia's eminent
sons have arisen. They are, however,
very poor, and when their children are
young, they are unable to provide for
sickness or death. They work twelve
hours a day, receive fourteen shillings
or fifteen shillings a week, have a frie
house, with a small garden. As tihe
children grow up they are sent into
service to relieve the burden that rests
upon the parents. From their well
stocked gardens, the Scottish agrieul
tural laborers obtain potatoes, green
vegetables, and fruit.
Many of them get their milk either
free or at a nominal cost from the
farm. The family breakfast consists
of porridge and milk; dinner of broth,
meat and potatoes and tea; at six p. m.
they hive porridge and milk, followed
by tea, with bread, butter and jam.
The wife of one of the oottars, who
furnished the facts through Dr. Wylie,
Stewarton, Ayrshire, for me, states
that her husband receives fifteen shil
lings a week and the allowances al
ready alluded to, and that she is able
to keep the household (L ea., her hus
band, self and five children) on twelve
shillings to thirteen shillings a week,
the remainder being required for
clothing, boots, etc. The cottar, prac
tically, can make no provision what
ever for sickness and death, unless in
a few cases only, where he pays a pen
ny or two-pence a week into a burial
society. It is when his children grow
np and enter service that he may be
able to save a litte money.-Fortnight

Dr. f --V - P c ci copains peculiar to the
t sex, and the labor
and worry of rearing
a family, can often
be traced by the lines in the woman's face.
Dull eyes. the sallo-w or wrinkled face and
those " feelings of weaknesso " have their
rise in the derangements and irregularities

rangemuents, paiufu_ disorders, and chronic
weaknesses of won'en, can be cured with
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. For the
young girl just entering womanhood, for
the mother and those about to become
mothers, and later in "the change of life"
the "Prescription" is just what they ueed ;
it aids nature in preparing the system for
the change. It's a medicine prescribed for
thirty years, in the diseases of women, by
Dr. R. V. Pierc, chief consulting phsician
to the Invalids' Hotel and SurgicalInsti
tute,at Buffalo, N. Y. Dr. Pierceas Favorite
Prescription will cure the chronic Infanloma
tion of the lining membranes which cause
such exhausting drains upon the system.

failtness, nervous debility and all disorders
arising from derangement of the female
organs and functions.
