Gauss.
Catarrh is not only dangerous, but it
causes bad breath, ulceration, death
and decay of bones, loss of thinking
and reasoning power, kills ambition
and energy, often causes loss of appe
tite, indigestion, dyspepsia, raw throat
and reaches to general debility, idiocy
and insanity. It needs attention at
once. Cure it with Gauss’ Catarrh
Cure. It is a quick, radical, permanent
cure, because it rids the system of the
poison germs that cause catarrh.
In order to prove to all who are suf
fering from this dangerous and loath
some disease that Gauss’ Catarrh Curd
will actually cure any case of catarrh
quickly, no matter how long standing
or how bad, I will send a trial pack
age by mail free of all cost. Send us
your name and address today and the
treatment will be sent you by return
mail. Try it! It will positively cure
so that you will be welcomed instead
of shunned by your friends. C. E.

What Our Farmers A re Saying and Doing
SEEDLING TREES.
It is not often one sees the old
fashioned seedling peach trees now
adays, for people are too fast for
the bygone age. I, for one, am ex
tremely fond of old-time things, and
especially trees. In my grandmother’s
orchard stood some apple trees and
I have not seen any like them in
twenty'years, although I have search
ed catalog after catalog to find a de
scription of them, but to no avail.
They were planted from scions taken
from other trees and she never
knew the name, but she called them
the “Streaked June.” It had the
most delicious flavor, and I have so
often wished I had one of those
trees. Those trees are all dead now,
and as I think of them it seems I
have never tasted an apple half so
good since. One gentleman once
called them the Dane. Much has
been said in praise of the Elberta
peach, and truly it is a beautiful
peach and fine shipper, but the taste
is equal to a dose of quinine and
alum mixed to me. I have them in
my orchard for those who like them,
but never eat them myself. I have
a taste for the white English, Blount
and Tinley. These grow from the
seed. I have a white English tree
15 years old, a friend of mine has
Linley trees 25 and 30 years old,
and the peaches grow as large as any
Elberta I ever saw. I have a friend
who has an Indian Blood tree, a con
stant bearer, 30 years old. There is
also the old Chinese-cling, much lov
ed by a large number of people who
do not remember the pretty Blont, a
rich buff in color and sweet and
juicy, and one of the best seedlings
to be had. There are the honey
peaches that are most desirable, with
only one fault, and that is they some
times rot in wet seasons. I have
seedling trees that bore a full crop
this year, and at this writing I have
two trees bending under their loads
of fruit. They are October peaches,
and are a white, clear seed. When
all the other fruits have said good
bye they put on their pink dresses
and say, “Here I am. Am I not
good?” I have always been fond of
plants, of shrubs, and trees, espe
cially those that grow from the seed.
I have planted a lot of peach seeds
this season and when I transplant
them I will watch each one with
much interest. I have trees that do
not fail to bear each year. I prune
them myself. I get a stepladder and
climb up on it and take my knife and
pruning shears and cut back all the
wood Ido not want. Generally when
I get down some smart Alex comes
to look at my work and invariably
says, “You have ruined that tree.”
The next year when he comes to
stand under it and eat the good
fruit he makes a different remark,
such as this, “How is it you have so
many peaches? We haven’t any on
our trees.” I answer, “Because I
ruined the tree pruning it.”
I tend the orchard and my husband
looks after the strawberries and
grapes. He has a nice vineyard two
years old that bore some delicious
grapes this season.
I wish to give a remedy for borers
in peach trees, which will be found
3effersonlan
to be helpful to the tree otherwise.
The recipe and how to apply:
Four cans of potash (10-cent cans)
diluted in two quarts of boiling wa
ter. One-half gallon of kerosene.
One-half peck of unslacked lime. One
gill of powdered bluestone. One gill
of copperas. Thoroughly mix, let
stand several days.
Take a hoe and carefully draw the
earth away from the tree. Pour
water on the tree and wash off the
dirt below the crown of the root, or
just where the root and tree bark
meet. Apply the mixture (which
should be of the consistency of paint,
if it is not, add hot water to make it
so) with a paint brush, painting it
around the crown and for two feet
above. Do this as soon as the leaves
fall and again in March. You will
have good fruit, and no borers and
healthy trees. After the last appli
cation draw the earth back to the
tree, taking care not to cover the
bark of the tree. Leave the ground
level. Do not pile it up around the
tree. In sandy soil I put red clay to
the roots of my trees, and in low,
damp places, where the ground is
rich, I put sand and leaf loam around
the roots. Coal cinders are good to
drain trees in wet places; will also
fertilize them.

HOW TO GET RID OF RATS.
Tell me how to exterminate rats
by a safe method. W. C.
Marion Co., Miss.
Editorial Answer: There are nu
merous means suggested, but no
easy and certain method of keeping
the farm free of rats. By keeping a
few good cats, by the constant use of
traps, by resort to poison when ne
cessary, and some forethought in
constructing farm buildings, protec
tion from great loss or annoyance is
obtained.
For poisoning, strycnine is com
monly used, but it is so rapid in its
effect that the rats die in their run
ways, and odors resulting from their
decay are very objectionable. Prob
ably barium carbonate is the best
farm poison for rats and mice. It is
cheap, fairly effective, and readily
eaten on bait because it is practi
cally without taste or smell. It is
slow in its action and consequently
the rats are likely to leave their
usual quarters to find water, which
makes it a good poison for use
around the house.
In quantities sufficient to kill rats
it is practically harmless to larger
farm animals. One part of barium
carbonate, or barytes, to five or six
of dough made from corn meal, or
bread on which barytes and butter
are spread, forms good bait. —Wood-
bury Georgian.
THE WILD GOOSE PLUM.
The first tree of this fruit grew
where the carcass of a wild goose
had decayed. It was generally con
ceded that the seed was in that
goose’s crop, but no person ever
knew, or ever will know, just where
the seed of that tree did grow.
The goose was killed in the fall
season, as she was migrating south
ward to spend the winter, conse-
quently the name of the plum. This
plum is extremely peculiar in growth
and production in the different soils.
In high, dry, sandy, poor soil, it is
large, and of beautiful, transparent
color, of yellow and red blended. It
is of delicious flavor, but on rich
limestone land it is not worth plant
ing. It always bears entirely too
full, and the fruit is of a dull red
color. On its favorite soil it will
yield larger profits than the early
peach.—Southern Fruit Grower.
SUN THE CROCKS.
The old ways of doing things were
not all bad ways. Some of them
were the very best. You remember
how carefully your mother used to
sun her milk crocks on the farm?
She was a true scientist without
knowing that fact. She did not know
about bacteria and bacteriology, but
she did know that sunning the crocks
kept the milk pure and sweet.
Sunshine is death to all kinds of
germs or bacteria. Every milk ves
sel should have all the sunshine it
can get. The churn and the churn
ing cloths and butter cloths should
be sunned regularly. Without sun
ning and scalding they become un
speakably filthy and spoil the milk
and butter. —Our Dairy.
HUMUS AND HOW TO GET IT.
We had a letter the other day from
a reader who wished to tell other
readers how to raise corn. His pre
scription was short and simple: Put
corn stalks or green pine boughs in a
furrow, bed on this furrow and plant
the corn.
Now, this man had really found
out one important sact —that his soil
sadly needs humus; but he had not
found out how to get that humus.
Imagine a man putting pine boughs
or corn stalks along all the rows in
a twenty-acre corn field, and think
ing that he was doing profitable
work! It is just such wasteful and
laborious “fiddling” about and “mak
ing believe” at farming that ails the
South today. What that man wants
to do is to sow his corn land in cow
peas and then put in some winter
growing crop. Then the next sea
son he can grow peas or soy beans,
or peanuts or even sweet potatoes on
it, sow it in crimson clover, plow the
clover under and thereby add more
humus and more nitrogen to his soil
in two years than he would get in a
lifetime of monkeying with corn
stalks and pine boughs.—Progressive
Farmer.
JEFFERSON ON FARMING.
The wealth acquired by speculation
and plunder is fugacious in its na
ture, and fills society with the spirit
of gambling. The moderate and sure
income of husbandry begets perma
nent improvement, quiet life and or
derly conduct, both public and pri
vate. —Thomas Jefferson.
Do not allow a person who has
just come from a sick room to milk
a cow.
Wells should be protected so that
no surface water can drain or seep
into them.
