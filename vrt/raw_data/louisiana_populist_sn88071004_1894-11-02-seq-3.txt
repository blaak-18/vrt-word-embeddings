According to previous announce
went Mrs. Carrie Myers, assisted
by Miss Eva :McCain, entertainlle
the citizens of Montgomery last
oaturday evening by exhibiting the
wonderful development of local
talent in both the arts of music
and elocution. Mrs. Myers but a
short time sinee took a class in
elocution as one of the branches of
the Montgonmery High School, anmd
the exhibition last Saturday even
ing displayed a wonderfutil and
commendable progress in this de
partment and speaks volumes in
Sfavor of Mrs. Myers as a teacher.
The music clasof Miss Eva Me

the praise attending the success of
this entertainment. Many of the
participants in elocution being call

A large per cent. of the citizens
of Natchitoches were highly en
tertained on Friday night last by
Col. L. P. Copeland, the renowned
prince of orators on the subject.
"Handsome People." To our re
gret we were unable to attend, but
we have heard the lecture very
highly praised by those who were
there. We are told that the Pro
fessor elegantly portrayed those
beautiful traits of character that
make men noble and place them in
the highest rank of civilization and
moral worth.

AlWat 11 o'clock last Saturday,
the leam ad fire was given, and
exc.itement ran high. It was event
ually learned that the cotton on a
platform .at the Natchitoches rail
rond depot had caught fire and
was burning. The fire engine was
rim to the depot, but the cotton, or
nmst of it had been seperated and
rdled off the platform when the
engine reached the scene, though
it did valuable service in extin
guishing the burning eqttep. Some
25 or 30 bales were burned pretty

Tee Late bsr ata, Not for Yos,
One of the best business men in tows
had an inconsiderable Ar. om his pref.
sea some few days since, which dama
geod the house a little and destroyed $35
dollars worth of funiture. When he
looked at his policy it only covered the
house, so he lost enough in 15 minutes
to pay for a policy on his furniture for
3 years. He called in next day and put a
line on his furniture, but it was like
locking the stableo after the horse was
gone. But its never too late to do good,

Mr. C. Howard, of Marthaville,
La., is holding a copyright for
the celebrated Howard Hog Reme
d', which he is selling. It ie
claimed to be a perfect eme for all

keep bogs in a perfectly healthy
condition all the time, this will cer
tainlybe a gret boom to the peo
ple of this country if it is succee
ful, any how the cost is but 75 oants
and is therefore worth trying. Mr.
Howard left a few of the recipes
at this okoe and if any one desiree
totryit, he ean do soby sending
as 75 cents.
Well, the big show has coame
ad gone, and a whole lot of mon
ey went with it, and if the people
ever entertained any very high
opinion of it, that went along

great deal left behindit. While
there were some featores at it that
did very well, when you compare
the advertisements with the actual
