; .throughout, nothing occurring to the
an!mar the. perfect harmony which am

Ity submitting gracefully to the will wh
of the majority. ch
The Gazette believes that the par- tol
a:tiran of the defeated faction will Ca
give' their whole support to the tee
nominepes, whose election is now
certain. Like good Democrats -Pa
they will fall in line and do their fol
utmost to give the ticket a large ma

A most encouraging feature of Ti
the meeting was the presence of our h
best citizens, which augurs well for

Then and Now.
There was a time when he who would
keep informed of the progress of knowledge,
the record of discovery and invention, and
the currents of human thought, could and
indeed must rely chiefly if not wholly upon
books. That day has passed. Books we
must still read, as the crystallization and
permanent embodiment of human thought
and knowledge. But to-day it is the news
- paper, the magazine, the periodical review,
upon which we must chiefly depend if we
pril would follow closely the intellectual move
are ment of the day. And now a new difficulty
to has arisen. This newspaper and periodical
altr literature has beeome so multitudinous and
ver bulky as to be a heavy burden to the busy
man or woman, while even the person who
has leisure and inclination to read widely
Sis often unable to get access to the current
publications. Especially in the smaller
cities, villages, and rural districts is the
lack of such opportunity felt. It is felt by
the clergyman, the teacher, the lawyer, the
physician, the merchant, the artisan, the
farmer and the cultured and thoughtful
practical literary question is: With all
these and many other classes of persons the
great practical literary question i.;: How
can I best supplement my indispensible
home paper? It was to answer this ques
and meet this demand that PUBLIC OPIN:
ION (now published in New York City
