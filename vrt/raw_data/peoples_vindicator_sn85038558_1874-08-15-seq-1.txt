(From the N. 0. Picayune.I
Tihe ;netrtsentiment of the sober
minded and efllcting citizens of New
Orleausis mhnilested on all sides, in
no intli4int terms, as opposedto the
attempt of a small number of over
zealous partisans aid aspirants ' for
'ity and parfsh oflices to narriow down
the opposition to the Radical iniquity
of this State to' the comparatively
small parly with elings to the.name,
and to what is ratlfr imaginatively
stylod the orlgaui:tie ncalled "Dems
ceratlo." '.The overwhelming senti
aent of the dominant class of this
opposition is to cut loose from all the
plirties tviich have Oiitherto divided
the people and subjected them to tie
eontr6al of leaders who were not ae
ceptable, or rather to: disperse and
abolish these various organizations,
and with their fragments to for a par
ty which' will insure a'vectory for 6in
esty, g6od government and the over
throw:ofChe arpet-lbag-negro dynas

This"plain and sensible plai, cso
successful it other States, has been
nmet with a bitter opposition and a
dasgodng temper, whieh have prov
9d qute ineffective e;cee to strength
en this resolution of thJe great major
tyof good ciltizens. who are not par.

*be.greatly -agotsed by a surrender
of their very limited lnteriatin whft
ever of glory attaches to the 'name of
this 'venerable party. Besides the
judgment of the people which. con

mule Wats mellin' its enseedest. How
ever we dropped into the Iit and
then the smell wasn't so bad. We
r squatted down awhile to get our noses
r free of the stench, and began to think
about when the bear won't come.
D S'pose we'd been there nigh onto two
- hours, and began to think the bear
r wasn't comin' that night, when we
a heard the bluslh crack. Then all was
still for awhile. We, began to sus
r pcion he'd put out, and both of tss
was just gettln' to our. feet when we
heard the old fellow snort. We drop
led back to the bottom and lay quiet,
neither of as darin' to speak. But
somethin' awful was goin' on outeide.
The brush was snappi'. and flyin'
I amut, and the old iear seemed to be
mRin' up the groirad fearful. Well,
|I 't know what to do. If I climb
.le+out I knowed I was good to Ib
the bear's supper.. If I stayed quiet I
didn't kbow what Aeccond he'd throw
himself'into the eble and craunch me
up like Pve erannched a little fried
fiash. .Peter was acroueled down in
the, corners slhakin' like a leaf. I
knowed he wouldn't be no use in a
fight, 'twnan't worth while to count
on him.
"WeU, I gathered by gun r nad rope

above the ground. Gentlemen, the
bear was standin' by that mule with
his back roalied up like the roof of a
house, and looked -mighty nigh as
high, and the maddest lookin rvar
mint I ever saw! I saw hlm selze

in the air like it had been a kitten,
and I dopped :tuk..a prayin' that
there might be meat eqgugh. on that
