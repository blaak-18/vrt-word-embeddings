SUBTREASURY PLAN.
DISTILLERS AND BANKERS EN
JOY ITS BENEFITS.
The subtreasury rlan as Outlimed by the
farmers Asks Much Iess From the
(;overrnent Than is Now (;ranted to
the Wealthy listlitersr
The report of the commissioner
shows that on Ju:no 30, $189, there
w.re 4576 registered distilieries, and
434J were in operation. The amount
of grain used was 20).990.924 bushels,
and the ntnoer of gallons of spirits
produced was $7.'47.,46. The an
nual expense of taking care of this
Iranch of the internal revenue ser
tices was fully t2.600,000. The
average amount of spirits warehoused
for the past three years is about 66,
1r)0.000l gallons, besides 7,465.000
zailous bhed foroverdue taxes, making
in the whole about 7;3.50,000 gallons
upon which taxes have not been paid.
The amourt of this tax would be $66,
lI').0JU. The above facts are given
simply to show what our government
has done and is doing for a class of
its citizens, and by inference to in
lquire why it should not extend simi
lar priviieges, only in less complicated
form, to the agricultural classes of
the country. The subtreasury plan
asks far less of the government than
is now granted to the distillers. As
it is, the deposit of spirits can remain
in the warehouse for three years.
during which time government cares
for it at a cost of ý$,600.VUO per year.
or t7, 6).0,0J for the legal term. That
is, the government really advances
$7,80)0,00U before a legal demand
could be made for a tax. The distill
er has nothing to pay for the govern
ment amyloyes: he only pays the 90
ceuts tiper gallon tax. When spirits I
are put in the warebouse a bond is
given for the payment of the tax, and
a certified copy of the whole
transaction is given the distiller.
This copy of the deposit is good col
lateral security at any bank,
and to-day fully $70,000,000
of credit currency is obtained upon
this class of securities, and why not?
The bond assures the payment of the
tax and the government is the cus
todian of the property. The ageing
of the liquor pays the interest; also
when it is sold the dealer pays the
tax. In this manner thedistillers ob
tain the use of this vast sum of money
absolutely free. Is it unfair to ask
that the farmer may have equal priv
ileges with the distiller? Is not
the farmer worthy of as much oonsid
oration from the government? Why
oannot the farmer be permitted
to take his grain to government ware
houses for safe keeping? The distil
ler Is allowed to do so after the grain
has been transformed into spirits.
The banks have a credit with the
government of over 00x,.000.00 that
seturan them a profit; the distillers a
oredit of $70,000.000 that costs them
nothing. Why cannot the former
have a credit that be is willing to pay
for? The subtreasury plan oetoem
plates the same line of legisla
lion. only much less complia
ted and far more satisfacto
ry. The same statutory laws
that sow govern the warehouseing
of spirits, with but few amendments,
would apply to the subtreasury sys
tem. The innovation upon law and
oustom would et no figure. It vio
lates m orgeame law and establishes
no now puedets. There are 4349
registered distillery warehouses,
whioh Is msee than double the sum
ber f sub-treasuries that would
be requtred to carry out the sub
trseary plan for many yeas. The
eost of of oedeting them could ero
atally be no more. Here is foud a

1 H Ialt/s I,.
Bimetallism does not consist in the
parity of the two metals, but is a mat
ter cf law. Law, or custom which
had the force ot law, authorized all
the gold and silver to be coined into
money. This was bimetallism be
cause money could be made of the
two metals at the request of the owner
of the bullion. Gold monometalism
is now established in the United
States and Europe, because the own
ers of gold bullion can have the same
coined into money, but the owners of
silver bullion are denied by law any
such right. It is sometimes asserted
that the opening of our mints to free
coinage of both gold and silver at the
ratio of 16 to I would be silver mono
metalism. This is not true, because
the owners of the gold bullion would
have the same right of coinage as the
owners of silver bullion.-Washing.

Press dispatches state that Mr.
Cleveland's bond syndicate is replac
ing the gold withdrawn from the
treasury for shipment abroad and
fulfilling its agreement to maintain
the sold reserve. Isn't this an in
teresting state of affairs for the
American people to contemplate?
The United States treasury is abso
lutely at the mercy of a conscience
less gang of pirates. and is only tem
porarily protected from present loot
log by contract with the bond syndi
cate, by the terms of which the bond I
syndicate realize a profit of 10 mil- t
lions of dollars. Think of the gov- c

MADE SO VERY PLAIN.
THE DAILY PEDERAL RECEIPTS
AND DISBURSEMENTS.
The SItestlooMade So Planl That It (an
Not Be MIanderstood, by One Who
Ih Thoroughly Versed With Publto
Affalrs-Mlissio or Populism.
Our government. "the best govern
ment the world ever saw." is now re
ceiving from you tax-payers a little
more than one million dollars per day;
is spending about a million and a half
per day: and is revolutionizing our
currency system so as to make money
scarcer, products cheaper debts high
cr, and dollars harder to get.
Can't you see danger ahead ?
At the close of the Revolutionary
war this people owned eighty million
dollars as the price of four years of
war resulting in victory, liberty and
independence.
We now have one hundred and six
ty-two and one-half millions of dol
lars added to the principal of our
national debt as the result of two
years of Cleveland's profligate admin
istration. The bloated humbug of
Buzzard's Roost has sold us to foreign
Jews, and domestic plunderers: and
to make the condition of the peole
completely wretched is using all the
corrupting influences of patronage to
revolutionize our currency and make
our debts and our taxes twice as
hard to pay.
Populism came forth in 1892 and
demanded that old political landmarks
be re-established, that our govern
ment be re-dedicted to the purpose
for which it was founded, that the
principles our ancestors put upon
record in the Declaration of Indepen
dence be made a living letter anu no
longer a sealed book.
No innovation did we seek. No
rash experiment did we propose.
Every policy we championed had the
sanction of experience, the support of
sound reason, the inspiration of jus
tice and good will to our fellow men.
We were feared, hated, abused, in
sulted, maltreated, and trampled un
Ler foot.
.Why?
Because we were said to be anar- I
shists, communists, incendiaries, rev- 1
olutionists.
By whom?
By the very gang of Democratic and I
Republican bosses who now seek to I
tear down the financial system of the
constitution, reverse the historic pol
icy of the government, violate letter
and spirit of the laws imbedded
in the statute-book, unsettle the cus
toms of trade and the obligations of
contracts, revolutonize prices by de
stroying half the money of the peo
ple, add to the burden of taxes by
making the dollar scarcer and harder
to get, double the value of all debts
held against you by making it twice
as hard for you to get the money to
pay with! i
There is no anarchy in this pro
gramme, no incendiarism, no revolu
tion. c
It's statesmanship, pure and simple i
-and its watch-word is, "Long live t
the Money King, and death to the
people." 1
Why is it that a man who never t
saw a gold dollar in his life is so
dreadfully uneasy for fear that all
debts and taxes will not be made pay- i
able in gold alone?
When he loses the privilege of pay
ing in silver or greenbacks, how much
better off will he be? f
Why is such a man so deeply i
grieved when they tell him that if the
government goes to coining silver
dollars our dollars will "go to Eu
rope." °
What could be do with a gold dol
lar that he could not do with a silver
dollar?
Why does such a man have night,
mare when the village merchant or a
the passiag drummer pictures to him (
the horrors of £ **flood" of European E
-ollars?
Does such a man know where the
silver in the silver-dollar he now has
came from? Does he know that it
did not come from Europe? d
If so, how does he know it?
If European silver, melted and coin
ed into United States dollars cannot b
be distiagulshod from American sil
ver, melted and coined into United O
States dollars, how would such a man
ever know which was the "food" dol
lar, and which wasn't? P
He wouldn't know which to run
from, would he?-Atlauts Peoples

' THE FLIGHT OF GOLD.
AN BX-DIRECTOR OF THE MINTS
"SOUPED."
lHe is Proved to Be a Tool and liar, by
Iis Own Report, Which is Fully ius
talned by the Market Quotations at
That Time.
I
Edward 0. Leech, director of the
United States mints during the liar
1 rison administration, contributed an
article to the Jul% issue of the North
American Review, entitled: -.How
Free Silver Would Affect U's." The
line of prophecy developed by the sin
gle standard theorists in 1l78, and
followed since that time in the press.,
in congress and at conventions of
bankers. is closely adhered to. -"Na
tional dishonesty," "'a silver basis."
*'dumping ground for the world's sil
1 ver," and "-light of our stock of gold"
are the evils specitlcally predicted
should the United States return to the
policy of the early days of the govern
ment and coin gold and silver at its
mints on precisely equaly terms at a
given ratio of 16 to 1, or such other
ratio as congress in its wisdom might
adopt.
The recent director of the mints
adds nothing new to the silver dis
cussion. None of his gloomy fore
bodings are fresh, and most of them
were proved to be false by the partial
and unfriendly enforcement of the
bland-Allison act, which at no time
received the favorable consideraion
of the executive department of the
government, including the directors
of the mints. This experiment in
limited free coinage was preceded by
all the prophecies of disaster which
are newly set forth in the Leech re
view. But it did not, between 1878
and 1891. a period of over twelve
years, result in nationaldishonesty nor
placejthis country on a silver basis;
did not draw from other countries
their stock of silver, and it actually
added, as shown by the mint reports
prepared and published by Director
Leech, to our stock of gold. The rea
son for the latter result is easily
found in the increased prosperity of
the country. The balance of trade
was in our favor, and as international
balances are settled in gold, our stock
of yellow metal was steadily built up
by these balances until 1890 when,
according to the official report of
Director Leech, an outflow of $70,
000,000 in gold from New York was
artificially caused by the banks and
bankers of Europe, in spite of the
fact that "the rate of sterling ex
change was below the point ($4.88)
at which gold shipments can
be made without loss." The
movement," says the mint director,
",must have been artificially stimula
ted by banks and bankers in Europe
paying a premium on gold or making
discounts to bill-drawers for cash re
mittances. This was the result of a
condition of affairs very unusual in
the mercantile world."
The reader can take his choice be
tween the official report of Director
Leech in 1891, page 87, and
his gloomy forebodings in the July
issue of the North American RBeveiw.
If the report was correct-and
it is fully sustained by the treasury
statistics and market quotations of
the time-then the predictions in the
North American Review article may
be lightly dismissed as the result of a
bad digestion, or of a desire to eater
to the gold standard element of the
east, which expects to control the two
great parties in 1896.-Denver News,
Iank Note Boyeott,
H. B. Martin of the executive
board obf te Knights of Labor, says
the boycott against nations bank
notes will go into effect on Septem
ber 3. .,After that date, he says.
'-all knights, their friends, farmers'
organizations, are requested to refuse
to take bank notes for any obligation
due them. We expect active support
from the silver men, who recognize
in the banks the bitterest
enemies to the white metal. Many
labor organizations have already
given notice to their employers that
they desire to be paid in legal tender
money, and not in bank notes, and
many employers will co-operate with
us. It must be remembered that bank
notes are not legal tender, and no
man can be forced to take them. By
the time oongress is in session next
Deoember we expect the boycott to
be in full swing. and to have a good
effect on legislation."
