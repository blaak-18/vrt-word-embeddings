the benefit of hose who have not
had experience in preparing Bor
deaux, we would emphasize the mat
ter of mixing the two solutions to
gether at the same time, rather t 1
to pour one solution into the other, a*?
would appear to be the easiest way.
By far the best Bordeaux is made by
the plan first mentioned.
Lime-Sulphur Wash is prepared as
follows:
Stone Lime (fresh, unslaked) 20 lbs.
'Sulphur (flour or flowers) .. 16 lbs.
Water to make 50 gallons.
Directions: First mix the sulphur
into a thin paste. Place this in a ket
tle containing 15 gallons of boiling
water. Add the stone lime, which
will at once commence to slake. While
the lime is slaking stir often enough
to keep the sulphur well mixed. Much
of the sulphur will dissolve while the
lime is slaking. Continue the boiling
for from 45 minutes to one hour, de
pending on the degree of heat. Time
of boiling should be regulated by the
appearance of the mixture. When
properly boiled the lime sulphur wash
will be a dirty, orange red color with
slightly greenish cast, and no sign
of the yellow sulphur will be evident.
When steam is employed for boiling
the proper color may often be secur
ed in 36 to 40 minutes.
After mixture is boiled dilute to
50 gallons, us ng cold or warm water.
The latter is preferable. When the
mixture is diluted it should still re
tain the orange red color.. If the yel
low sulphur color appears in the di
luted mixture the operator mav know
that the mixture was not sufficiently
boiled.
The above specific directions are
given because it is assumed that the
lime-sulphur will be used only where
the San Jose scale is present. To de
stroy the scale, as well as prevent
the leaf curl, the lime-sulphur wash
should be made strictly according to
directions.
Spray Now and Thoroughly.
Peach growers, whose orchards were
affected last year, will not need to be
warned further about the necessity
for immediate work. And from ob
servations made by the writer last
year, it seems probable that nearly
all peach growers in North Georgia
must have seen the effect of the leaf
curl disease. This article is intend
ed as a timely warning. It is hoped
that all fruit growers will heed this
advice and prepare at once, if they
have not already done so, to spray
the peach orchards.
When spraying be sure that thor
ough work is done. Cover the trees
entirely. Otherwise the result of the
spraying will be a disappointment.
Wherever orchards are infected
with the San Jose scale, and the prop
»er spraying has not been given, the
owners may be assured that one thor
ough spraying with lime-sulphur wash
will keep the scale in control, and 1 ,
also, prevent the leaf curl. Do not
make the mistake of thinking that
the Bordeaux alone will control the
scale. Bordeaux acts only as a fun
gicide, that is, a prevent on or rem
edy for fungous diseases. It will not
have any effect on the San Jose scale.
Any persons reading this article,
and desiring further advice, are re
quested to write to the State Ento
mologist, Atlanta, Ga., who will glad
ly reply promptly to all inquiries.
Remember the adage, “An ounce
of prevention,’’ etc.
Spray at once! Don’t Delay!

MANY CHILD LABORERS.
Census Report Shows 1,750,000 Little
Breadwinners.
The extent to which child labor Is
employed in the United States is set
forth in a bulletin issued by the census
bureau recently. The statistics pre
sented are for 1900, and relate to the
employment of children as breadwin
ners, of whom 1,750,000, in round num
bers, between the ages of ten and fif
teen, were so employed. Breadwinners
are defined as those earning money
regularly by labor, contributing to the
family support, or appreciably assist
ing in mechanical or agricultural in
dustry.
By far the most important occupa
tion for children is that of agricul
tural laborers, the number of children
ten to fifteen years of age so employed
being 1,054,446. About two-thirds cf
the total number of child breadwinners
were employed on the farm and most
of these children were members of the
farmers’ families. Next in importance
comes domestic service, or the occupa
tion of servants and waiters or wait
resses, in which 138,065 children were
employed, most of them being girls.
About one-third of the children em
ployed in gainful occupations were fif
teen years of age, and more than one
half were fourteen or fifteen years
The number of fourteen was 790,623, or
45.2 per cent of the total.
Boys Outnumber Girls.
Os the total number of child bread
winners ten to fifteen years of age,
72.2 per cent were boys and 27.8 per
cent girls. Almost invariably the per
centage of breadwinners is much great
er among foreign-born children than
among native children. The percent
age of breadwinners among negro
children is much higher than among
white children.
The cotton mills furnish employ
ment to children to a greater extent
than any other manufacturing or me
chanical industry. In 1900 the num
ber of cotton mill operatives ten to
fifteen years of age was 44,427. Os
the 71,622 messengers and errand and
office boys in the United States 62 per
cent were district telegraph messen
gers and errand boys, 23.3 per cent
were office boys, and 14.7 per cent
were bundle and cash boys or girls.
Nine-tenths of the children employed
in such service are boys.
Children in Needle Trades.
The occupation of the textile work
er or the needle trades furnished em
ployment to 35,070 children between
ten and fifteen years of age, of whom
5,136 were boys and 29,934 were girls.
The total number of children, ten
to fifteen years of age engaged
in the tobacco and cigar factories was
11,462. Os the 49,998 glassworkers
reported in 1900, 5,365, or 10.7 per cent,
were from ten to fifteen years of
age.
Os the 23,657 children for whom sta
tistics were specially compiled, 17,956,
or 75.9 per cent, were living in homes
with their parents; 3,380, represent
ing 14.3 per cent, or approximately
one-seventh of the total number, were
living with widowed mothers, and 578,
or 2.4 per cent, with mothers who
were living apart from their husbands,
and whose economic position was
therefore likely to be analogous to
that of a widow. The number of chil
dren that were either fatherless, or
were not living with their fathers, was
4,943, representing about one-fifth of
the total number.
Small Percentage In School.
The percentage of school children
in the total population five to nlno
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
years of age enumerated in the United
States was 53.3, which is only a little
higher than the percentage (50.6)
shown for selected families included
in this study. Os the number- of chil
dren ten to fourteen years of age in
these families, only 31.9 per cent were
at school, while the corresponding per
centage for the total number of chil
dren of that age in the United States
was 79.8. But after these children
reach the age at which the opportuni
ty for employment as wage earners
begins, their school attendance suf
fers.
In the families with child breadwin
ners, schooling rarely extends beyond
the age of thirteen. Os the children
fourteen years of age, 97.4 per cent
were employed and only 1.6 per cent
were at school.
Illiteracy Percentage Large.
Os the total number of children ten
to fourteen years of age in the United
States, 7.1 per cent were illiterate, as
compared with 18.8 per cent for the
child breadwinners of the same age in
cluded in this tabulation. For the
messengers and errand and office boys
the per cent of illiteracy is compara
tively small.
By far the greatest degree of illitera
cy is that shown for the children in
cotton mills. In the south almost one
half of the cotton mill operatives ten
to fourteen years of age are illiterate,
and about one-fourth of those fifteen
to twenty years of age. The smaller
percentage in the older group of oper
atives would indicate that a good many
of these children learn to read and
write after they are ten years of age.
But the percentage of illiteracy in the
older group is still very high, render
ing it probable that large numbers
of these children are destined to re
main illiterate for the rest of their
lives.

We read in Greek mythology of
a mighty w'restler, Anteus, who
renewed his strength every time he
touched his Mother Earth, and there
fore he was invincible. This story,
so beautifully told in the Greek hea
then mythology, is but an allegory
of the farmer. He has been the power
of every land and clime through all
the ages, and his strength comes from
the soil, from the kindly, generous
touch of Mother Earth. And this coun
try needs to get back in closer touch
with its vitality, the farmer classes.
We need more farmers in our law
making bodies, state and national,
that the great bodies politic may have
their spirit renewed and revivified
by coming in touch with the spirit of
the plain, common people. We want
laws, state and national, more in ac
cord with the wishes and hopes of the
people as a whole and not of this, that
or the other class. The people do
-not go astray and if the farmers will
just assert their rights and run things
awhile, we will see our blessed coun
try swing back into the old channel
and go on her way proudly, honorably,
honestly, rightly to a worldly destiny,
grand, splendid, powerful and magnifi
cent beyond conception.—Farmers’ Un
ion Banner, Winnfield, La.

TICKETS AND PLATFORM.
It is the duty of every good citi
zen to examine the two party plat
forms and the two tickets, beginning
with state tickets and covering coun
ty and legislative. Examination
should be made of both men and prin
ciples, and after doing so each indi
vidual should cast his vote for what
he believes to be good citizenship,
which means to so vote as to promote
the best interests of the country.
Any man who is such a blind parti
san that he prefers to elect a man
of his own party because in some man
ner he has managed to get on the
ticket, no matter how unfit he may
be —in preference to some good and
creditable man nominated by an op
posing party—is in a deplorable con
dition of mind, and is forgetful of the
first duty he owes to his country, that
of good citizenship. So long as the
voters will blindly follow the lead of
an arrogant machine, and refuse to
repudiate at the polls unfit nomina
tions, just so long will the people
have corruption of the grossest sort
in politics. If the machine is per
mitted to corrupt a party, and the
voters step in and endorse that cor
ruption, but little can be expected in
the way of reform, or good govern
ment.
The machine politician will always
try to belittle independence within
the party. He will cry lustily “party
loyalty” when it only means subject
ing one’s self to the machine. What
he wants, is to continue to hold the
power he has already secured, ami
gather in more, and consequently when
the rank and file of the voters begin
to show independence his power is
threatened.
As was noted at the outset, every
voter should carefully examine the
party platforms and tickets and when
voting for public officials make the
same kind of a choice that he would
if he was about to engage the officials
voted for to conduct his business af
fairs. Do not fear in any manner the
“boss politician,” the people are about
ready to discharge that class of men,
and they expect each voter to do his
duty to his country, by voting for
what he believes to be right, and with
out submitting to the dictation of any
political machine. —Search Light.

BILLY GRIMES.
“Tomorrow morn I’m sweet sixteen,
And Billy Grimes the drover,
Has popped the question to me, ma,
And asked to be my lover.
Tomorrow morn, he says, mamma,
He’s coming here quite early
To take a pleasant walk 'with me
Across the fields of barley.”
“Oh, hold your tongue, my daughter,
dear,
There’s no use now of talking.
You shall not go across the fields
With Billy Grimes a-walkinr.
To think of his presumption, too,
The dirty, ugly drover!
I wonder where your pi ide has gone,
To think of such a lover!”
“Old Grimes is dead, you know,
mamma,
And Billy is so lonely.
Besides they say, to Grimes estate
That Billy is the only
Surviving heir to all that’s left,
And that, they say, is nearly
A cool ten thousand dollars, ma,
About six hundred, yearly.”
“My daughter, dear, I did not hear
Your last remaiks quite clearly;
But Billy is a clever lad.
And no doubt loves you dearlv.
Remember then, tomorrow morn,
To he ur> bright and early.
To take a pleasant walk with him
Across the fields of barley.”
