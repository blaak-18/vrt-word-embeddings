Bright, cheerful, progressive, always up

The Home Magazine takes 4rnk with the
leading and most influential' periodicals

ance and true christian morality. What
ever is hurtiful it condemns without t
r fear or favor, and makes itself felt in the
homes of the people as a power for good'.
The Great Household Magazine of
America, is more thoroughly identified

cial life than any other periodical in the
country.

ready writer, has in her possession a large r
amount of original material from which a

ences.
"Homes for the People," a series of ad
mirably suggestive articles on homes and
how to make them pleasant and attrac S
t tive. by Mrs. E. B. Duffey.
"The Story Teller." This department t
will be' unusually rich. Biides art
abundance of short stories, two or three
serials will be given during the year.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub.
lished. 1
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than liali a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne 4
widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, relinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketchet
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper!
that is publ;shed in this contry, fromp it*
never containing anything that woul
offenld the feelings of any one, either in
a religions or political bense,-- or- that .
could not be read at any fireside without)
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so largt
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the par
per itsel ai4'not lbf eja. edn any ex
traneods infutiznces,'suc sb the populari
Sty of individual writers, &c.
Gt ood, however, as the Saturday Even.
r ing Post has been in the past, it is out
intention to make it still better in the9
future, and with this object in view w
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and wilt
call to oar assistance writers of admitte¶
4 ability and ktown reputation.
r By increasing its former attractions
r and addling-maany julicious and plea
ing novelties;- by studying how to pleas
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
coreasing industry and enterprise, and by
j. enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue and
continue to maintain the claim of th
Saturday Evening Post to its title of T
OLDEST AND THE BEST Of Faunily Stor
Papers.
