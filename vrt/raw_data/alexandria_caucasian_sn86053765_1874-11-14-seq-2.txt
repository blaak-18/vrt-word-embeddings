pie who did not vote against us,
but more particularly those who
voted with us, are cordially invited
to attend.
Good Feeling! Good Cheer!
Good Speaking ! Turn out Every

To Our Subscribers .—We are
compelled to ask our subscribers
who are in arrears to us to pay up
their subscriptions. Our terms
were Cash, in advance, but as the
times were hard and a political
campaign in progress, we indulged
some of them by deviating from our
rule. Most, if not all. of such are
now able to pay up, and as the
amount of $3 00 is so small, they
will not feel it, but it will in the ag
gregate greatly assist us. We send
a notice with this week's paper to
all delinquent subscribers and hope
that they will at once send us the
amounts due.
Our yearly subscriptions do not
expire until March, at which time
those of our subscribers who
wish to renew, will please notify us.
Our friends who subscribed for
six mouths are notified that their
subscriptions aro out, anil if they
wish them continued they will
please send notice.
Our Job Office .—We are now
fully prepared to do auy kind of
Job work, and solicit the patron
age of the public in that line. We
can do every description of work
and do it neatly and in the best
style. We are determined not to
be underbid, and will do work for
nothing before we will submit to it
and if that is not low enough we
will pay a premium to persons for
the privilege of doing their work
free. We have recently been cut
out of several paying Jobs by a
certain interested party, telling
those who had the work to be done
that we did not have the type.
Such statements are false. We
have all colors of inks, papers and
cards, a variety of type in quanti
ties, a Job Press and good Printers,
and we can do Job Work as cheap
and well as it can be done outside
of New Orleans.

THE BEPBOOfr.
Proud, in8olentand vain-glorious,
the mighty, corrupt and vicious
Republican party which had in 1872
achieved so signal a victory over
all opposition and received an un
qualified endôraement at the hands
of the American people, came before
the same people in the State elec
tions just now passed. Confident
ot victory, eagerly counting on the
renewal of its lease ot power to
plunder and oppress at will and
gloating over the spoils which were
to be its portion with Congress and
the State governments all in its
hands, it has met with a terrible re
proof. Its recent overwhelming de
feats iu the great States where it
had its strongest hold, teaches it a
lesson which may bo read by him
who runs. That lesson is that
while the underlying basis or foun
dation of that party under the ad
ministrations of General Grant, has
been a firm conviction that the
great American people were at
heart corrupt and dishonest, that
they are not only in theory but
practice too, both upright and hon
est. The fact that the people of
Massachusetts have repudiated Ben
Butler, the nominee of that party
and elected General N. P. Banks,
an fadepe~ndent,~biit bonc8t7and71
date, leaves no room to doubt that
the revulsion of feeling was not on
ly wide spread but deep rooted.
The party of professed high mor
al ideas, which taught that it was
no harm to steal and no crime to
lie, has come to grief, and the great,
honest heart of the American peo
ple throbs with delight at witness
ing its discomfiture. Drunk with
success, rushing madly on a course
of which the end was Imperialism
and the beginning the uprooting of
the very foundation of all civil lib
erty, and common honor, honesty
and decency, it has been checked
midway in its career by the warn
ing voice of a power it is impotent
to resist and powerless to disobey,
and we behold it now as it stag
gers, halts bewildered, and looks
around in amazement. If we were
to ask if it is not a fact that this
party has been corrupt for six years,
we would be compelled to answer
that it has been. Truth compells
the admission by every candid rniud
that it has been overbearing, un
scrupulous and reckless since the
very beginning of General Grant's
first administration. It was noto
rious then and hardly denied by
his partisans that the sure and cer
tain road to his favor was through
costly presents. Witness the do
nation to him of the $50.000 dwel
ling bouse, the gift of the Long
Branch Cottage, etc. Nor was this
craving for the wealth which was
to bring with it all other blessings
in their opinion, confined to the
President. Congress was no less
corrupt as is evinced by the Credit
Mobilier and other money making
schemes of the Congress under
Grant's first administration. If
then, as is a fact, the Republican
party has been dishonest for six
years, it is pertinent to enquire by
what means, why is it that it is on
ly now defeated 1 If it has been
corrupt all the time and the people
honest, why have they not before
now riseu in theirmight and driven
the thieves and plunderers from the
high places held by them ?
By one who has attentively ob
served the course of events during
the last # six years the question is
easily answered. First of all the
great financial panic of last year
had a great deal to do with the fin
al downfall of the party upon which
fell all the odium for that panic.—
And when the masses of the people,
the working people, laboring mas
es went before a Republican Con
gress and President with a demand
for an inflated currency and they
both barkened to the pleading voi
ces of the capitalists and refused
assistance to the people, the peo
ple who had before supported that
party turned their backs upon it.—
The Salary Grab was another load
it had to carry. All these things,
together with the talk about a
third term for Grant, the universal
knowledge of the unblushing dis
honesty that prevailed everywhere,
contributed in a great measure to
secure the defeat of the Republican
party, but as a proof that they alone
did not do it and that there must
have been some other canse, we
have to point only to the fact that
this condition of affairs has contin
ued during these six years. That
other canse, the great moving im
pulse to the reaction against this
party was its failure to play upon
the Southern outrage string as sue
cessfnlly as it had been doing. The
people of the North were and are
tired of the bosh and display of out
rages at the South and the revul
sion of feeling carried them as far
towards the vindication of t h
South as their prejudices had be
fore carried them towards oppres
sing us. They have at last realized
the true condition of affairs in the
South and we hope and predict that
the end of all our troubles draws
nigh.
The Natchitoches Prisoners.
The gentlemen who were so arbi
trarily arrested at Natchitoches,
and who have been in confinement
for several weeks, passed down on
the Sabine on Thursday last. We
had the pleasure of meeting our
friend Cosgrove of the Vindicator,
and Messrs Taylor and Carter,
while the boat was at our wharf
Tb f arc , no "' nnder boml8of » 5000
«»f '. Md are on thel^way to Nen'
Orleans, in company with their se
curities who propose to deliver
them up to the U. S. Commissioner
on their arrival, so as to force or
secure a trial for them.
Beckwith, the partisan U. S. Dis
trict Attorney telegraphed from
New Orleans to Natchitoches " un
der no circumstances to give them
a preliminary examination, but if
they would waive examination to
release them on bonds|of $5000 each.
This was done so as to allow the
matter to drop, now that the elec
tion is over, but the gentlemen ar
rested do not propose that Beck
with, Packard, Kellogg & Co.,
shall get rid of the Elephant in any
such way. They, as the whole
country, have been outraged by
their brutal and arbitrary arrest,
and they propose to know the
why and wherefore, and to enquire
if such things can be done and go
unpunished.
They were charged with " con
spiracy," complicity or some such
balderdash in the Coushatta affair.
Wo have j ever before met the oth
er gentlemen, but we know to our
certain knowledge that Mr. J. H.
Cosgrove was in New Crleans at
the time of the Coushatta affair,
and did not return uutil some
days, a week or more after the
whole affair was over. We were
together at the btate Convention at
Baton Rouge only a few days be
tore, from whence he went to New
Orleans and we came home. He
came up nearly two weeks after
wards and some time after the
Coushatta business on the R. T.
Brjarly, and took a hack from
here to Natchitoches. We do not
suppose that any of the other gen
tlemen who were arrested, had
anything more to do with it than
he had.
Their arrest, confinement and at
tempted release without even a
form of trial was a brutal outrage.
The " best government the world
eversaw"has already had to answer
for just such crimes against the lib
erty of American citizens and iu
1S7C the sovereign people will by
their votes crush out every vestige
of the tyranny that thus overrides
every right secured to the individ
uals who make up the general gov
ernment.
CP* We hear of some threats and
attempts to run over some of the
colored men who voted for us, by
the radical negroes. We are told
that some of them attacked the
house of Carter Carr, in town one
night last week. Now, we have
this to say to the radical negroes in
this parish. If you touch a hair of
the heads of any colored man for
voting with us, every white man in
the parish wili rush to his defense,
and you will find it rather lively
times for you. This persecution
must and shall end right here, and
right now. Every man shall vote
as he pleases, and while we will not
trouble you for voting against us,
you shall not trouble any man who
voted with us. Try it if you dare !

A TELEGRAPH.
The greateat need of the Bed
Biver valley at present is the means
of quick communication with the
outside world. In other words,
we need and have not g ot what all
the world besides has, a telegraph.
Water means of transit to and from
the busy, teeming world aronnd us,
we have for nine months ont of
the twelve, but even at its best, it
takes thirty-six honrs for news to
reach us from New Orleans, and
while onr tastest packets are run
ning in this trade, it is not possible
to obtain an answer to letters or
returns from orders for freight sent
on Wednesday until the Monday
following. Thus cut off from the
centre of our trade we are really
further off from New Orleans, in the
matter of communication than if we
were on the other side of the Atlan
tic Ocean. They know in New Or
leans within two honrs, any change
ot the cotton market in Liverpool.
We can not know of any change in
New Orleans iu less time than thir
ty six hours. In this we are fear
fully behind the times.
It is useless, and is not pertinent
to enquire the canse of our not hav
ing a telegraph. The war, depres
bion in all kinds of business, tail
ures of crops, the financial stringen
cy of the times »fid the waut of en
ergy on our part are all reasons suf
ficient to account for it.
ficient to account for it.
We are now more immediately
concerned in the enquiry as to how
we aro to get a telegraph. The
Western Union Telegraph Com
pany, who, we believe, own all, or
nearly all, the lines in this State,
arc générons and enterprising and
with assurances that they would not
lose money, will, we have no doubt,
build us a line even it they were
certain of not making anything at
first. A line from here to Natchez,
Bayou Sara or Sbreve|>ort would
cost we supftose about the same
amount for construction. The dis
tance is very nearly the same we
believe, to follow the line of the
towns and we do not think that it
would take more than $5000 fo
buikl the line to either place. Some
time ago we wrote to the State
Manager or Superintendent of the
Western Union Co., as to the cost
etc., of bnilding a line from Alex
andria to Natchez and to know
what the Company would do for us.
He replied, suggesting that it
would be better to build the line
to Sbreveport, as we would then
have the aid of Natchitoches, Maus
field and Sbreveport, and he pro
posed that if we would raise a sub
scription of one half the cost, the
Company would bnild the line, fur
nishing the other half the cost and
obligating themselves to refund the
whole of the half subscribed iu tel
egrams to the subscribers. This
was a generous offer, but the hard
times then prevailing prevented us
from getting a sufficient amount
subscribed here, and the matter
was dropped.
A line from here to Sbreveport
would undoubtedly more than pay
expenses all the year around and
in the business season would make
money. We are not particular as
to where it has its terminus so that
it taps some main line, but we are
inclined to think that Sbreveport
is the best place, as we could then
get news down Red River as well
as from New Orleans and the extra
costs of sending messages via
Sbreveport to New Orleans would
be very small, if any.
We intend to keep "a driving" at
this telegraph question until we
get one. We have written to the
Western Union Co., and will lay
their reply before our readers when
it is received. The main object of
this article is get our citizens inter
ested in the matter and to wake up
the good people of Natchitoches
and Mansfield. For this we de
pend upon the Vindicator and Re
porter. The South Western Tele
gram at Shreveport gave us a kind
notice some mouths ago, and we
would like to bear from it and the
Times again. We are all interested
and we appeal to them to help us
ont.
We are bound to have the line
anyhow.

INTRODUCTORY.
Some weeks ago we announced
onr intention of begining after the
election, a series of articles descrip
tive of Rapides parish, its soil, cli
mate, products, resources, timber,
water courses, and in fact, of every
thing which could interest an emi
grant looking for a new hom& We
begin the series with thi« article,
and propose to continue un
til we exhaust the subject, if we
meet with any encouragement from
the land owners of the parish. We
can of course do nothing without
their assistance, and we earnestly
beseech them to reflect upon the
subject, to see their true interest»
and to forward to us for publica
tion such offers as they may be wil
ling to make, of assistance to immi
grants so that wa can know just
what to promise in their names.—
They are, after all, the parties
most interested and if they do not
take the matter m hand it will be
useless for us to agitate the ques
tion.
We would like to see the thou
sands of acres of rich alluvial land
now lying idle in this parish, culti
vated and made to produce the
wealth of which we are so sadly in
need. There are thousand« of hon
est hard working men with indus
trious families in Georgia, Alabama
and Mississippi, in the teeming
West and over-crowded North, who
are seeking just such lands, pre
cisely such homes as we have to of
fer; and indeed, their is a tide pas
sing our very doors and pouring
into Texas to enrich and build up
her material interests. Mauy of
whom would gladly stop and cast
their fortnnes with us if we offer
any inducements to them. We
have sit still and brooded over our
bad luck, and our hard fortunes
while our sister State, Texas, by of
fering liberal inducements and by
advertising those inducements lias
redeemed herself and is now on the
high road to the prosperity which
we know should be onr portion and
which wonld have beeu ours long
ere now if we had had the energy
and forsiglit to stop the ceaseless
tide of wealth which has passed us
by and gone to her more hospita
ble borders.
Now that like her, Louisiana can
offer the additional inducement of
being freed from the curse ot Rad
ical rule, she can make a successful
effort to stop this stream of travel
and secure some portion of it, at
least for herself. We do not pro
pose to deal at all with the aspect
of the question as applicable to the
State and shall confine ourselves to
the effort to secnie immigration for
our parish only. Will the land
owners of Rapides assist us f Do
they desire to see their waste lauds
settled by industrious white labor
ers Î
We make them this offer. We
will advertise all offers of lands to
be given to emigrants free of cost
to them, without making any
charge therefor, We will also ad
vertise lands offered on other fav
orable terms and will make no
charge at all unless the advertise
ment shall bring settlers on the
land, then we will charge regular
rates. We will require no pay
ment in advance, nor any responsi
bility for advertising from the land
owner. We will publish all offers
and look to the land when settled,
sold or leased for our pay. In
other words, we will take all the
risk. Send in your offers. If we
do no good we charge nothing. If
we sell or settle yonr lands, then we
want only regular rates. Who
makes the first offer f
