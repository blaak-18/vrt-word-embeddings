Menace of Modern Immigration
By Dr. H. W. Evans, Imperial Wizard
An Address Delivered October 24th on Xian Day at Texas State Fair, Dallas
In the average incidence of vane
real diseases, which is 6.6 per cent,
the colored race is an over-balancing
factor. From the rate of admission
to sick report in the Army, colored
men appear to be several times as
apt to be infected as white men.
“Just those states with the largest
P
proportion of colored population,” the
report concluded, “show the largest
rates of venere&ls disease. Adjacent
regions with an intermediate propor
tion of colored population show an in
termediate amount. Relatively little
was found in the New England states
including New York and over the
Northern states west of the Missis*
sippi River. Wisconsin and the Da
kotas, inhabited largely by immi
grants from northern Europe, Ger
mans, and Scandinavians, show the
lowest rate for these diseases.”
Dr. Laughlin, the eugenic expert I
referred to a moment ago, has made
for the Committee on Immigration a
remarkable study of the ralative de
generacy of all classes of social in
adequates except the venereal.
Taking all the nine major types of
social inadequacy together, and weigh
ing the races according to their pro
portion in our total population, the
foreign born white are 146 per cent
of the average. These excesses of the
immigrant stock above the average of
inadequacy are the measure of the
drag of an improperly controlled im
migration upon our racial American
effectiveness.
These total results Dr. Laughlin
classified by the older and the newer
immigration, and he finds clear evi
dence of the lowered quality of the
newer flood of immigrants from
South and East Europe.
Insanity and crime, are the worst
manifestations of social inadequacy.
Insanity among immigrants, Dr.
Laughlin shows, is nearly two and
two-thirds times more frequent thah
in our older native stock. Among
Russians, Finns and Poles, Bulgar
ians, Irish, and Serbians the propor
tion is highest of all. The _ Irish
proclivity to insanity is over four
times that of our older native stock
as a whole. It is so great that it
causes the rate for northwestern Eu
rope stock as a whole to exceed slight
ly that for southern and eastern Eu
ropean stock.
Of all criminals in our prisons the
negro race furnishes over twice ’its
prorata share. The Italian race fur
nishes nearly two and one-fifth times
its share. The Greeks nearly three
times theirs. The Balkan peoples two
and three-fourths times theirs.
What can now be done to lessen
this menace of physical, mental and
moral blight that has come upon us?
There must be a nation-wide health
crusade!, more exacting, more persis
tent and more consecrated than any
the world has ever known. First, even
though it were to cost a billion dol
lars, or ten billions, the federal gov
ernment should institute a survey to.
determine the extent and causes of
every disease that exists, with parti
cular reference to alien sources.
Then, upon that foundation of com
plete information, the fight for bodily
and spiritual wholesomeness should'be
waged scientifically, unceasingly, until
the scourge of infections and deficien
cies is no more. Just as education
should be free, so should each and
every agency of health be available
without cost to every human being
within our borders. Health ought to
be regarded as a public function from
beginning to end, with hospitals,
nurses and doctors available to all,
rich and poor. Instead of having our
Public Health Service only a minor
bureau, it obviously should be a Cab
inet Department. For the eternal
good of the country the first three
ranking places in the Cabinet should
be those of the Budget, Education and
Health.
At present the legal tests for re
, ection of immigrants are not ef
ficiently exacting to detect inheritable
diseases in a person apparently free
of such tendencies at the time of ad
mission, but which inevitably will
later develop in his own life or show
in the physical and mental inferiority
of his children born in this country.
If this continues, we invite slow but
sure disaster. Certainly, therefore,
whatever immigration policy may be
adopted, it should include the rigid,
unrelenting exclusion of every appli
cant whose acceptance would now or
in the future lower the health level
of the nation.
(8) Home Building. In order to
insure a nation’s perfect and per
manent development, besides an ever
increasing sanity and complete sani
tation, there must be happy, whole
some family life.
What the sun ia to the solar sys
tem, the home ip to America. The
supreme test of .national success lies
in the number and quality of opr
hemes. That ft alike the highept*
safest, soundest expression of both
personal and public welfare. With
out one we cannot long have the other.
When our forefathers associated the
privilege of voting with the holding
of property, a# they often did, that
was in their mind. To them material
possession meant homee.
Continued From
Fpr generations they hawed homes
out of the wilderness. Those later
coming to our shores faced no soofa
struggles to subdue natural and na
tive enemies, but they had the same
aspiration and generally achieved it.
Mostly the immigration now coming
is made up of males. Slither they will
do no mating and home making, or
the wives and mothers must be gath
ered to their breasts from among
superior classes.
For every hundred Greek women in
this country there are 444 Greek mem.
The Italians now have a ratio of 147
males to each hundred females. From
Southern Europe there have been
coming 163 males to each hundred
females. In the old immigration
there were 110 males to each hundred
females. Our own native white aver
age is 103.7 males to a hundred fe
males.
It can be summed up, fairly I think,
in this: Until about 1880 pusrhaps
ninety per cent of the immigrants at
least sought the ownership of homes.
Since that date probably ninety per
cent of the alien influx have neither
our home standards, nor in most cases
the desire to attain them. They are
the tenement herd. The farms and
suburbs know them not. We have our
Hester streets and our East Sides in
every large city, and box-car huts and
shacks in every industrial center —un-
sanitary, unwholesome, uninspiration
al—the natural* habltion and breeding
place of the moron, the nomad and
the criminal.
In no other respect is our modern
immigration more menacing. Its
mental and bodily qualities are lower
ing our level of literacy and health,
but the utter lack of home instinct
throughout the flood of inferior for
eigners that now predominate threat
ens our very institutions. America
means homes, or it means nothing,
and will finally end in failure, just
as that retribution has always come
to every country whose citizenship
worshipped not at the shrine of their
own firesides.
This nation is our home. We built
it. We protected it. We should and
do cherish it beyond all other posses
sions.
It is made up of many homes. They
are its brain and brawn, its heart
and soul. True Americanism implies
the public acceptance and practice of
every cardinal private virtue that has
its highest functioning in the home.
The love of an individual for his or
her home, multiplied by many mil
lions, should exactly measure the
wonderous depths of our common pa
triotism. Patriotism, real patriotism,
is not sentiment; it is the overflowing
of the spirit of family life into na
tional life.
“Free Trade” In Cheap Foreign Labor
Americanism, as the vision of it
lies deep in our hearts, must be found
ed upon the three basic standards I
have so hurriedly discussed —educa-
tion, health and the home. Even
more briefly, let us now consider two
economic teats of national stability
and happiness in their bearing upon
the immigration problem.
The first of these is labor. I be
lieve, in fact I know it to be God’s
truth, that this nation is paying the
penalty, at usurious rates of interest,
for generaions of false attitude to
ward the creative forces of mankind.
Since the Lord said,'“Six days shalt
thou labor, and rest upon the seventh
day,” all the emphasis has been placed
upon the latter part of that divine
injunction. We have -defiled the Sab
bath, when God intended, and so ar
ranged His universe, that the six days
of labor should be all-important. The
command from on high was to work,
work, work, work, work, work—and
not by proxy, but with our own hands
and hearts and feet. Otherwise it
would not have been provided in na
ture’s laws that health and happiness
have no other source that is so in
variably safe and sure.
This nation has committed, or at
least permitted, fundamental errors
for which the curse of evil conse
quences may never entirely be oblit
erated. Slavery was instituted and
the racial results of it will probably
remain so long as the Republic has
existence. Then, in response to the
same unchristian dread of creative
work, more vaguely and yet more
generally, we eatablisbed servantry.
There followed logically, inevitably,
the more modem and monstrous cheap
labor idea. The steps have been:
owner and slave, master and serving
man, magnate and menial.
This is a national tendency which
we cannot charge to immigration, ole
or new. In fact the old immigration
is perhaps more guiltless than the na
tive stock. But it is fundamentally
related to our modern immigration
problem.
Humanity has become a commodity.
For mercenary motives, our importers
of jt .want, the most Inferior grade*
Industry desires cheap labor. There
fore, ,we have had this recent flood
of 6 and 10- cent citixenship.
Take any map Which shows the con
centration of the South and Eastern
European type of immigrant and yon
will see what has happened. Wher
ever manufacturing and mining and

hordes of unskilled labor have over
whelming teea to tfy tort
two dgeadeg it has reached too pro
portions of a deluge,
Do our overlords of industry rpalteg
what they are do'ag to America?
Have they stopped to measure the na
tional consequences of this cheap for
eign labor idea ? Is it the part of pa
triotism to import inferior mental and
moral elements in such numbers as to
lower our standards even below the
danger point? Is profit more impor
tant than the sum total of American
Citizenship?
I leave it to them; and to you, to
make a satisfactory answer.
Immigration and Agriculture
Now, let us go 4 step further—a
related step. Consider the condition
of agriculture in this country. Farm
ing, more vital than any or all other
industries, more wholesome and es
sential to good citizenship, is prac
tically prostrate. You know the
causes of this calamity. I shall not
describe them, nor detain you with a
recital of the evil consequences.
- The point is that both immigration
from abroad and migration from
within are intensifying this problem.
Instead of agricultural develop
ment, there is an alarming movement,
increasing by leaps and bounds, to
wards city congestion. Our popula
tion is already more than half urban.
Forty per cent Is was in 1900 ; 46.9
per cent in 1910; 51.4 per cent in 1920;
—that is the record which cries out
a warning and demands constructive
attention.
In this farm field exists the only
legitimate and justifiable excuses for
cheap labor, yet that class is mov
ing irresistably cityward to swell the
slums and multiply immorality. For
example, thoroughout the South the
colored race, in numbers far beyond
the statistical showing, is migrating
to the North—not to its rural dis
tricts, but to its industrial centers.
The colored problem is fast becoming
a Northern problem, and vastly more
difficult than it ever was in the South
because in this new form it is dis
tinctly intensified in municipal areas.
Am I unduly fearful with respect
to all this? You cannot read history
without the discovery that every na
tional calamity outside nature's cata
clysms has been born and bred in city
environment. The influences that
foster degeneracy and crime do not
develop in the open spaces. "Where
wealth accumulates and men decay”
was not written of the plains and
prairies, nor of woodland and moun
tain; but there is not in this genera
tion, there never has been, nor ever
will be, a great city without its te»*~
derloin, its tenements, its sweatshops,
its houses of assignation, its over
strained charities, its night courts, its
East Side and, now, its negro quar
ters.
The city and its environs—that is
the destination of an overwhelming
majority of our modern immigrants.
New York is not comparable to other
alien congestions—we would none of
us want to live in America if it were
—•but the condition of the metropolis
in only slightly less degree is coun
try-wide. In that city there are—
Natives whites numbering.. 1,172,952
Whites of the old immigra
tion stock 1,566,558
New immigrants (mostly
from Southern Europe).. 2,477,778
Without being unkind or unjust, we
can say that there are in New York
City about two and one-tenth times
as many unassimilable foreigners as
native Americans, while the better
and inferior aliens added together
reach a total almost three and one
half times that, of the native Ameri
can stock.
In 1920, of the 13,710,000 foreign
born whites in the United States,
10,355,000 were in cities and towns,
and making a closer inspection, we
find that six and a half millions of
these were in cities of 100,000 and
over.
Of our native stock, three-fifths is
on the farms and in rural villages,
with the balance of the farming pop
ulation almost entirely composed of
the older immigration. It is pre
dominently the dew and more inferior
influx that is congesting and corrupt
ing our municipalities. Practically
none of it has sought its own and the
national welfare by turning to agri
cultural life.
The Inherent Capacity for
Americanism
Thus far I have suggested to your
mind the three cardinal tests of
Americanism as applies to individuals
—intelligence, health and wholesome
homes— and also immigration aspects
of the baric labor and agricultural
problems. There come now the cru
cial national life standards, for which
a few phases will suffice.
I submit that, any immigrant, to be
desirable and an asset to America,
must come yrith an inherent capacity
for our kipd of citizenship. He may
be untrained, but he must not be un
tamable. There must be nothing in
his racial or national character that
will close the door and keep it ever
lastingly shut against American ideas
and ideals.
£v; *
Next, tp be bp and the
must e#tp;r pur gates wftb 4 <toap Wifi
abiding respect for epnsttt;uted au
thority w thmr hearts, For centuries
on every occasion* upon battlements
and platforms and pulpits, in field and
factory, and at his own fireside, the
Anglo-Saxon has asked the one ppra
mountly important question—“ What
is the Law?” Were the law inade
quate or unjqat* be changed it; but
always and forever, until time shall
be no more, that is where he stands,
as it is where we stand —for law and
order, From the British Isles and
Scandinavia and Germany and Hol
land and Switzerland have comp peo
ples born to that divinely essential
attitude. Let more of them come.
They are our kinsmen in tradition and
ideals. But generations, nor centuries
cannot school the Latin, the Greek,
the Balkan and the Slav to that fund
amental conception. That very ele
ment ip more than one country at this
minute is playing with a fire that
may ignite another world conflagra
tion. Let them predominate, or even
greatly dilute our inherent reverence
for established institutions, and, in
stead of evolutionary advancement, in
the end we, too, will be cursed by the
uncertainties, the chaos, the catastro
trophes, that characterize revolution.
The immigrant must be of the
right racial and national stock and,
then, finally, his highest allegiance,
his most unselfish, unbiased love,
must be to and for America.
Elements We Cannot Assimilate
If this nation is to continue its
charted course, and attain its destiny,
there will have to be harmonious as
similation of each and every alien ele
ment in complete accordance with
these essential standards I have laid
down. Such assimilation implies a
common merging, which, to be suc
cessful, must bring about true social
and political equality.
It meens intermarriage upon a
basis of physical, mental and moral
equality, with no menacing threat of
uneugenic consequences to succeed
generations.
It must mean, in a culminating
sense, a spiritual wedding with the
state —a kind and character of citi
zenship in which no higher temporal
loyality shall exist, or be permitted to
exist.
With respect to present and future
immigration, this problem of the
melting pot is made many times more
difficult by reason of the fact that we
already have at least three powerful
and numerous elements that do now,
and forever will, defy every funda
mental requirement of assimilation.
They cannot be merged because of in
surmountable social, racial and relig
ious barriers. They will always stand
apart from our own people.
First there is the negro—ten and a
half millions, in number, about one
tenth of the whole population. They
have not, they cannot, attain the Ang
lo-Saxon level. Both biology and an
thropology prove it, and the exper
ience of centuries confirms that con
clusion. The low mentality of sav
age ancestors, of jungle environment,
is inherent in the, blood stream of the
colored race in America. No new
environment can more than super
fically overcome this agd-old heredi
tary handicap. In fact, with the
present ever increasing exodus from
country to city, it is an undoubted
fact that another generation will be
marked by retrogression. The re
cords, authoritative and unemotional
ly scientific, show the negro to be es
pecially susceptible to tuberculosis
and alarmingly vitiated by veneral
infections Even though these eugen
ic considerations did not forbid such
bodily merging, there could never be
intermarriage between whites and
blacks without God's curse upon our
civilization.
There is not a semblance of racial
hate in my heart. I say all this be
cause it is the truth, and must be said.
At the same time, I recognize my re
sponsibility and demand that you see,
and meet yours. The negro is here.
He was brought here. In love and
justice must we ever promote his wel
fare, his health and happiness. But
not in this generation, nor any Amer
ica will ever know, will real assimila
tion be. possible.
Another absolutely unblendable ele
ment is the Jew. For ages, ever since
his ejection from Judea, he has been
a wanderer upon the face of the earth.
In speaking of him there is never a
reference to the country whence he
came, because, throughout the cen
turies, there has been no country he
would or could call his home. Into
hia life has come no national attach
ment. To him, patriotism, as the
Anglo-Saxon feels it, is impossible.
Persecution has been his lot—with
America, I am happy to say, the most
tolerant of all the lands in which he
has lived, an attitude reflected in the
fact that already a fifth of the Jewish
race is in this country. 1 would pre
fer to believe that all this unceasing
persecution has been unmerited, but
whether or not the Jew himself is
largely to blame, its indelible impress
is there, marked by generation after
generation of unchanging and un
changeable racial characteristics.

acterfetlc of Gentilo Defense of Klan.
While wild spMpftwft *od hfiedf 8*
charges of atfib rule ano lawlessness
arp bejjpg pieced at the door of the
Kgights of the Ku Klux Klan it is
interesting to look hack through the
pages of history. In the last issue
of the Christian Endeavor World, or
gan of the Christian Endeavor So
ciety, appears an article headed, “Mob
Rule in the Bible."
Bearing in mind the mobs that
killed a KRuwnan in Pennsylvania,
beat up a minister who favored the
Klan, and broke up meetings and
severely injure! scores of members
of the order with showers of bricks
and stones, it is interesting to read
what Bible history tells of mob vio
lence. After reading with an im
partial mind the facts is brought to
mind that though the Bible mob vio
lence has not attached itself to the
Gentile or the Christian, The in
stincts of mpb attack op unfavorable
persona shows itself as being part of
the nature of persons who are known
to be without the portal of the In
visible Empire. The Christian En
deavor World article states;
Mobs are a very ancient institu
tion. They are the herd run wild,
and when it runs wild it is capable
of very terrible things—things which
individuals members of the herd
would not dare to do single-handed.
The evil passions of a mass of people
are united into a overwhelming force
that' drives the mob onward in its
work of destruction.
Probably the most famous Bible in
stance of mob rule is given in Acts
19, describing the riot at Ephesus
which Demetrius the silversmith in
stigated. This man cunningly ap
pealed to the cupidity of the people.
Paul was destroying their business.
If he were allowed to continue to
preach, Diana would cease to draw
pilgrims from the ends of the earth,
ahd the walls of the city would fall
to pieces. So we read that when the
people heard this they were filled with
wrath; the city was thrown into con
fusion, and they rushed to the theatre,
having captured two of Paul's com
panions.
Nowhere in literature do we find a
more accurate description of the mind
of the crowd. “Some cried one thing,
and some another." “The assembly
was in confusion." “The more part
knew not wherefore they were come
together.” Behind all this, however,
we see lurking the sinister figures of
some Jews who brought forward
Alexander. They knew that the mob
must have a victim. Alexander
should be the victim. He tried to
speak, but all things on earth a mob
is the most unreasonable. They
drowned his voice in shouts: “Great
is Diana of the Ephesians." Noble
patriots! %
The town clerk, who kept his head,
brought the multidude to its senses
by reminding the people that they
were in danger of being accused of
rioting. Panting the beast slunk
home.
Centuries before this, of course,
rioting was common enough. There
is the case of Lot in Sodom. The two
angels that had visited Abraham en
tered the city of Sodom and were
made guests of Lot. We do not know
why the Sodomites wished to do them
harm, but it is certain that they
gathered around the house and de
manded their victims. They were
thwarted in their purpose, as .we
know, and the city was destroyed.
The riot that broke around Paul in
the temple in Jerusalem (Acts 21:
27) is a good sample of religious
riots, and shows how an appeal to
bigotry usually finds response. The
Jews “stirred up the people,” we are
told, and in few minutes the tem
ple court was filled with a surging,
howling mob clamoring for the life
of Paul. These noise spread to the
city, and the streets were filled with
people running in the direction of
the trouble. The whole city was in
confusion, and it was only the deter
mined attitude of the captain of the
band that saved the apostle’s life.
We have.no details of the stoning
of Paul at Lystra (Acts 14:19), but
enough is said to show that cunning
men played upon the passions of the
people and drove them somehow to
frenzy. It is possible for a group
of people to lash themselves into mad
ness. The more one reasons with
them, the madder they become. The
more right you are, the more they
want to crush you. When they can
not answer argument, they can em
ploy force. This is what happened
when Stephen, the first martyr, was
stoned. The people lashed them
selves into pitiless fury.
Jesus faced the mob (how nobly)
in the garden of Gethsemane. The
priests had been afraid before this
time to lay hands upon Him, for they
feared the people. It was only when
they had: succeeded in poisoning the
minds of the people against Him
(how old, again, is lying propaganda!)
and knew that they had behind them
a mob frothing with fury that they
sought the lift of Jesus.
There is a faint parallel to this in
the imprisonment of Jeremiah. In
Jer. 26:9 we have the record. Jere-
miah bad displeased thp people by
his Rl*in speech, and in the temple
itself they rose against him.
It Is interesting to note bow the
autboritie who should stand for law
seek its support. They did this
and order, often support the mob and
against both Jesus and Jeremiah.
Mobs, they say, are awful when they
are against law and order; but when
the mob happens to want the thing
which the authorities wish, but can
not get, the authorities suddenly find
that the mob is composed of patriots,
and mob rule is called patriotic. The
Italian Fascisti furnish a modern ex
ample. Italy has presented the
spectacle of a nation crowning law
lessness for the maintenance of law.
Moses had experience in dealing
with mobs, for every little while new
murmurings were heard and incipient
rebellions broke out. Often down
through history the martyrs have
been the victims of mob violence. We
have no details whatever of the
death of Zechariah, who, according to
Jesus, was killed between the sanc
tuary and the altar (Matt. 23:35).
The old days were turbulent. In city
after city Paul faced danger from the
.people. Even in Theasalonica certain
vile fellows of the rabble stirred up
trouble, gathered a crowd, and set
the city in an uproar.
somFstartling -
CONDITIONS IN 11. S.
From the National Bulletin of the
Naval and Military Order of the
Spanish-American War we clip the
following from an address of a regu
lar army officer, holding an impor
tant position in connection with the
National Guard organization. It will
readily be understood why the speak
er’s name can not be mentioned, but
it may be assumed that the state
ments quoted are accurate and
verbatim:
“We have enlisted about one thou
sand men at these headquarters, in
the last two or three months (Janu
ary to March, 1922) and we have
taken no man who was not a gradu
ate of the eighth grade or who had
not the equivalent education. Each
man was given a brief verbal exami
nation to test his education and men
tality and 75 per cent of these men
did not know: How our country
started; how it got its independence;
never heard of the Revolutionary
War, the War of 1812, the Mexican
War, or the Spanish-American War.
This was not confined to school grad
uates only, but to some men who
had had two years in high school and
who were no better informed.
“When 75 per cent of the young men
of the republic are so ignorant of the
history of their country and its insti
tutions, that country will not long
persist as a republic.
“To the companions of our order,
who are all middle-aged men, it will
undoubtedly come as a distinct sur
prise that in some of the large cities
we do not know the conditions in the
smaller towns: there is not a word
of the U. S. history taught until the
pupils have entered high school, which

stops at the completion of the gram

“Patriotism is not a matter of in

of our nation, we may hope for very
little regard or interest in its welfare
on the part of future generations.”—

AMERICA, THE BEAUTIFUL
0 beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!
O beautiful for pilgrim feet,
Whose stern, impassion’d stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat,
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God mend thine ev’ry flaw,
Confirm thy soul in self-control,
Thy liberty in law!
0 beautiful for heroes prov’d
In liberating strife,
Who more than self their country
lov’d
And mercy more than life!
America! America!
May God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness,
And ev’ry gain divine!
0 beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam,
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America'!
God shed His grace on thee/
And crown thy good with brother
hood
From sea to shining sea!—Set
