They affirm that as long as there's ti
life there's trouble and taxes. A
widow is hardly ever satisfied with v

have four legs to be a hog. A man b
with a red-headed wife seldom talks
too much. Office seeks the man t
with about the same energy that aI
rogue seeks a policeman. When a.
man marries the second time he al- i
ways makes an excuse of some kind
to his friends. Women talk of ow- I
ing other women a call in the same I
way that men speak of owing other
mpen a grudge. A man will look
through his pockets four times be- 1
fore he will give his wife his coat to
sew a button on it. Yea, as long
as there's life there's trouble, and

things are not what they seem to be.i

To say that the public road be. -s
tween Carenero and Lafayette, or tro
rather between the south limit of the
the 6th ward and that place, is in hai
an infamous condition, is putting it ma
mildly indeed. It is an advertise- lvif
r ment to the world of the slowness sat
and weakness of the merchants of Ne
Lafayette, because it is in their plc
power, and is their plain duty to in- egi
sist on the immediate removal of his

This official who seems to occupy a the
position as impregnable as that ter
filled by the Czar, could witn con- ate

who have the interest of Lafayette poI
at heart, be compelled to resign and
make room for one more compe
tent; or perform a duty that is as 1
plain as the light of day. The town a
of Lafayette controls a large portion law
of the Carencro trade, and we et
would right here beg to tell our peo- are
ple that the progressive town of On
Opelousas is not many miles to the of
north of us, and if the beautiful city rei,
of Lafayetee i: willing to have its cot
r interests completel-y annihilated by Par
L. one individual we would suggest thi
that we transfer our trade from the ci
o latter to the former place. We ris<

y seer of our ward, Mr. O. H. for

tious and competent official, and he LO
is has succeeded in' giving the sixth s

ten ounces of chloroform. Tanner coS

had resided there for the past three busi

Tanner all the evening, called on the c
Mrs. Dejoie and told her that Tan= Se

tried, but pould not get him home, thisi
but he had promised him he would town
come. home later. Upon receiving shall
this information Mrs. Dejoie went the
up stairs and locked the,~ room. m
About 9 o'clock Tanner came home, voca
went up stairs and finding his room hered
locked returned down stairs and en- due
tered the room where Mts. Dejoie smhl
and her daughter. Mrs. Louisa Man
Jourdan, were. He asked Mrs. mens
Dejoie why she had locked his room, deli
and she replied, so as to tell when tenS
he came in. Turning to Mrs. De- that
joie, Tanner said, "Old lady, you bush
have always been - good to me. I warc
am going to die. Life is not worth( se
living." He drew a bottle from his that
pocket and drank nearly its entire whel
contents. He reeled and fell on othe
the floor. Mrs. Dej *ie grabbed the g'
bottle and was astonished to find or i
that it had contained ten ounces of se
chloroform, which he had purchased than
from the American drug store. cen.
The ambulance was callkd and or 1,

a while at the house, and then re- oro1
moved him to the hospital. They thet
considered his condition very criti- tion
cal. Tanner has a wife and two galls
children residing in Lafayette, and shal
es he is separated from his family, hao
trouble is supposed to have been in
the cause of his rash act. They that
have been separated about six S'
months. Tanner, after leaving his that
wife, went to Atlanta, but was not gral
satisfied with that city and came to lice,
New Orleans. He obtained em- wee
ployment in the Western Union Tel- ai
egraph office. He wrote a letter to F
his wife about a month ago, but she rect
returned it unopened. Ever since beS

The "suffrage amendment" will cut quite (the
a "caper" in the comning campaign. The 5,0
law would be a very good one if it could be
applied years hence. Bui the day has not as
yet arrived when the people of this parish bui
are willing to support a platform that is bent
on the destru. tion of their ballots. The -
National I)emocratic party has been accused cart
of very grave errors since its taking the mit
reins of the government four years ago. Of ate
a course, no good Democrat blamed the has
party, as we were all of the opinion that it P
took a full term to replace the finances of 1
the country, in the same condition that
e Cleveland left them prior to President Har- sor
e rison's administration. We pardon the party
e for all errors done in the past, but we can
not forgive the Democratic party of Louis- th'
iana for having placed a plank in its plat- h
form, that will cast aside and detranchise
two-thirds of its best people in Southwest '
e Louisiana. We are surprised; very much
SSo, at the mild attitude taken by our dele
gates at Shreveport on the suffrage amend- pei
t ment. Why did they vote blank? Why thi
- did they not stand with St. Landry and
e Acadia (glory to those two parishes) and say pet
to the majority of that convention, "we are ty,
Democrats, but we can never vote a plank
that will disfranchise our constituents ?" In pe
d our estimation, a blank vote is two fold thi
worse than having voted for the amendment.
We expect our delegates to give us a thorough Pe
explanation of this matter. They cannot
d plead ignorance, as Lafayette's delegates to
Shreveport were all men of education and PC
broad judgment. We are of the same P5
Le opinion of that pure old creole, that old war
horse of Democracy, ex-Gov. C. H. Mouton, th.
of St. Martin, that conventions do not ex- pa
press the popular will of the misses-never
