PAGE SIX
Miss Page was crossing the penny
bridge for the fifth time that morn
ing, when it suddenly struck her that
the toll-taker must be very lonely all
by himself in his little sentry-box.
The morning was bright and sunny.
The road which ran along the lake
side was crowded with carriages,
pony-carts, and horseback riders. La
dies in light summer dresses were
walking under the maple trees beside
the road. There was a pleasant
splash of oars in the water as the
boats passed under the bridge, and
the talk and laughter of the rowers
came rippling over the lake. But it
occurred to Miss Page as. she walked
across the bridge for the fifth time,
that the beauty of the morning and
the gayety of the scene were not for
the toll-man. (So, at the end of the
bridge, as she laid her penny down on
the window-ledge, she tilted her
white parasol to one side, and said,
“You must be very lonesome here all
by yourself.”
The man in the sentry-box was in
his shirt sleeves. He had dull brown
eyes and a black mustache with
drooping ends. He gave Miss Page
an expressionless glance, and ans
wered, “There are people passing all
the time.”
“But nobody” — began Miss Page,
and then stepped aside for two young
girls to pay their toll.
“But nobody speaks to you,” said
Miss Page.
“They’ve no need to,” said the
man sententiously. ‘ ‘ They’d only
block the way.”
Miss Page felt that this was true,
for a butcher-boy had come up behind
her, and was pushing his basket
against her.
As Miss Page walked along the up
hill path under the maples, she
thought to herself, “Poor man! I
really must be pleasant to him. I
wonder I never thought of it before.
He looks as though he had no inter
est in life.”
Miss Page was an old maid, and
frankly called herself one. At her
summer boarding house she was pop
ular on account of her friendly dis
position. She had away of speak
ing to people without waiting for an
introduction, and of winning their

Sir, I am very much surprised to
see you say that Bryan’s, Watson’s
and Hearst’s political ideas are the
same. Are their platforms the same?
If not, why not? Is Watson trying
to fool the people? In 1896 Bryan
did run on Watson’s platform, but it
was not his idea. His idea then was
as it is now, to get in. He then
stumped the states for free coinage
at 16 to 1, and took every vestage of

liking at once. There was no stiff
ness about Miss Page’s intercourse
with her fellow beings.
She passed over the bridge for a
sixth and last time that day on her
way back to her boarding place. As
she stepped upon the bridge, she took
a. five-cent piece from her purse, and
laid it down upon the window ledge
of the sentry-box. She had been in
the habit of saving pennies in one
corner of her purse on purpose to pay
her toll. But this morning the idea
came to her that if she got change,
she might gain time for a remark.
“Still money-gathering, eh?” she
said, with a pleasant glance through
her spectacles. “You are the greed
iest man I know.”
The man said nothing, but pushed
toward Miss Page one of the little
piles of four pennies which he had in
readiness. But Miss Page thought
that she detected the glimmer of a
smile under the drooping moustache.
After that, Miss Page never paid
her toll without giving a friendly
word to the man at the same time.
He did not resent her friendliness,
but seldom offered a word in return.
Miss Page was an excellent walker.
(She made at least one trip over the
bridge every day. Usually she made
several trips. One morning she car
ried a tiny gray terrier on her arm.
“You don’t tax dogs, do you?” she
asked. “If you do, I’ll pay Muff’s
toll for him. I call him Muff, be
cause he is more like a muff than any
thing. ’ ’
“No, there is no charge for dogs,”
said the man, looking at Muff with
his expressionless glance.
“He is a present from an old lady
who was staying at the house, but
who has gone home now,” explained
Miss Page. She might have explained
further that she had nursed the old
lady through an illness, and that Muff
had come to her in the form of
thanks.
About a week afterward, as Miss
Page was taking her toll from her
purse and preparing to remark about
the pleasantness of the weather, the
man said, “How is Muff this morn
ing ? ’ ’
Miss Page gave a start of surprise.
is right now, Watson is a fool. One
or the other is a fool or a knave.
Mr. Editor, I wish you would ex
• plain wherein their political ideas are
the same. If they are the same, Tom
Watson is a mighty bad man. Why,
he denounces Bryan and his politics
to the lowest degree. Why he has got
me to believe that Bryan had gone
to the gold standard, national bank,
asset currency, protective tariff, and
was am in arm with Belmont, Ryan,
gambling Tom Taggart, Wall Street
& Co. Watson also says Bryan is ca
tering for the negro vote, dining the
negroes on fried chicken at his home,
and that he said he could not vote
for an soldier. Shame,
shame, Tom, if these charges are not
true. If I was Bryan I would not

It was the first time he had ever
made a remark of his own accord.
“Well, you do notice things,” she
said, caressing the little gray bundle
under her arm. “Muff was sick last
night. I think I give him too much to
eat. I must learn how to treat him
well without hurting him.”
Miss Page walked away smiling to
herself, and glad to think that she had
awakened a human interest in the
machine-like man.
After this, it was usually the man
who made the remark about the
weather. Miss Page was left to in
vent responses.
One morning in September, when
most of the city people had left the
place, Miss Page, with her parasol
raised, and with Muff on the end of
a chain, was walking under the ma
ples when she saw a man coming to
ward her, limping painfully. Miss
Page was just passing the man, when
he took off his hat and said, “Good
morning.” Then she recognized him
as the toll-taker. She had never
seen him before, except in his shirt
sleeves, behind the little grated win
dow, and she had not known that he
was lame. A feeling of pity came up
on her first, and then a feeling of in
security, as if a caged animal had es
caped from the menagerie and con
fronted her on the road. She did not
find it so easy to deal with her toll
taker, now that he was walking, a
free man.
“How is it you are not taking
toll?” she asked with a'shade of anx
iety in her voice.
“Oh, that was only my summer
job.” He leaned up against the pal
ings of a garden fence, and Muff
sniffed suspiciously at his lame leg.
There were red dahlias growing
near the fence. Miss Page took one
between her thumb and finger, and
smelled it absent-mindedly. She
knew there was no perfume in the
flower.
“ lam going back to the city to
night,” continued the man, still hold
ing his hat in his hand. 11 1 sell seats
in the box-office of one of the theatres
during the winter. The season opens
to-morrow. ’ ’
“It must be very confining work,”
stand any such charges, if they are
not true. If Mr. Bryan does not clear
himself, the people will believe Wat
son. Now if it is true that Mr. Bry
an dined the negroes on fried chick
en, get up your chickens, ladies, Mr.
Bryan -wants them for campaign
funds. They go to a premium.
Mr. Editor, you say that Watson
ought to turn his strength to Bryan.
Why not Bryan for Watson? You
know that Watson is far superior in
every respect as a staunch Democrat,
a statesman and a lawyer. Watson is
stronger in the North and Northwest
than Bryan. If Watson withdrew
and turned to Bryan, all his follow
ers would forsake him, and Bryan,
too, forever. They voted for Bryan
and got snowed, and he has, now left
said Miss Page?
“No,” said the man, speaking de
liberately. “I have a great deal of
time away from the box-office, and
help my brother in his store. I earn
altogether twenty-five dollars a week,
and I don’t spend half of it. I have
over three thousand dollars in the
bank? You have been very friendly
to me, Miss Page, all summer.”
Miss Page started at the sound of
her own name. She had never told
the man her name, and wondered how
he could have found it out.
“I had never thought before about
making a change in my life, perhaps
because I have always been too busy
to think of it. But your friendliness
made me think there might be some
thing better. I wish you would mar
ry me.”
The man had been looking into his
hat as he spoke, but now he looked
straight at Miss Page with his dull
brown eyes. If Miss Page had met
his glance, she might have seen a
light of eagerness smouldering be
neath their dullness.
Miss Page was red and uncomfort
able. She was more than forty years
old, but she had never had a proposal
before. Now the knowledge that she
had aroused the long dormant senti
ment of the man filled her with pain
and shame. His sober pride and faith
in his meager finances touched her
deeply.
“I am very sorry,” she stammered,
closing her parasol with a jerk. “But
you don’t know anything about my
circumstances. It is impossible—but
it was very good of you to ask me,”
she added, in a tone of great pity.
Muff gave three loud, short barks
in disapproval of the man, and Miss
Page gathered the little gray heap in
to her arms.
“I thought there was scarcely any
use in speaking,” said the man. “But
I thought I’d try.” He put on his
hat, and limped along by the garden
palings.
Miss Page, with Muff under one
arm and her parasol trailing behind
her, walked sadly toward the penny
bridge. There was another toll-man
there now, but Miss Page was not
friendly to him.
the principles they voted for then,
and their principles are the same now.
Watson’s chance with Bryan’s help
is better than Bryan’s chance with
Watson’s help. I believe that the
Democrats would swing to Watson;
but I know the Populists are not go
ing to swing to Bryan. They would
stay at home if he was the only
chance. They class him as a wavering
man. A wavering man is like the
waves of the sea —goes with the wind
and is tossed. A double minded man
is unstable in all his ways (James,
first chapter).
Mr. Editor, any comment agreeable
you may make.
Yours truly,
