tl
Symptoms of a Dseased Liver. *
JAIN in the right side, under the P
I edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left it
side; the patient is rarely able to lie w
on the left side; sometimes the pain D
is felt under the shoulder blade, and of
it frequently extends to the top of the tS
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken b
for rheumatism in the arm. The stomw bI
ach is affected with loss of appetite ri
and sickness; the bowels in general ai
are costive, sometimes alternative with pI
lax; the head is troubled with pain, Ii
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen- pl
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation ei
of having left undone something which a
ought to have been done. A slight, an
dry cough is sometimes an attendant. ,
The patient complains of weariness II
and debility; he is easily startled, his dl
feet are cold or burning, and he com- tl
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his s irits are low; and although ti
he is satis fied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely lI
summon up fortitude enough to try it. C
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend S'
the disease, but cases have occurred D
where few of them existed, yet exam- ti
ination of tile body, after death, has o01
shown the LIVER to have been exten- re
Ovely deranged. tc

CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, when of
taken with Quinine, are productive of vi
the most happy results. No better p

For all bilious derangements, and Ii
as a simple purgative, they are un. ,

(Nevow York San.) "
Washington, Jan: 15.
Dear Sir : The expressions referred
to an yours of the 10th w ersed in
private conversation, and td not
properly be ee made public. Apt at
tlhough they would interesta tie pub.
lie because used by a leadju ater
in the surrender of the oelleai of
1876, and would expose tleos 's pr'
tense upon whiob the Elpl bill
was passead, by which tha e dide,
they are not at all ecessary to sub.
stitute that feact. No one who will
consider the facts now before the
public, however reluctant to come to
that conclusion, can fail to see that
it was not, as pretended, that war
was apprehended from adherence by
Democrats to the constitation mode
of counting the electoral vote, that
they abandoned it, and allowed it to
be done by a Radical Commisison :
but simply because the. jobbing and 1
rival political interestt ein the Demo
cratic party, which had combined to
prevent Mr. Tildean's nomination, be.
lieved that those Interests would beI
promoted by co-operation with the
Radicals in setting aside the election.
Nor is it necessary to group all the
circumstances bearing opon it, to
substantiate thig position.. It is only
necessary to recall some of theclir
cumatances attending the transaction,
and to point to the subsequent eaon.
douct and present attitude of some of
the chief actors Ino it.
When, on the day after the elec
tion, and after Mr. Hayes bad pub.
licly admitted his defeat, Mr. Zacb.
Chandler ordered false returns to be
fabricated in LouisiOana, Florida, ad
South Carolina, to count him in, the
Democrats with one voice declared
that it would be the duty of the House
of Representatives to exclude these
returns from the count. Mr. Tilden, I
to strengthen the bands of the Dem
oerats in the House aIn carrying oat
the will of the party, prepared with
elaborate care from the records a
complete history of the proceedings
of Congress in counting th electotal
vote, showing that the House had re
peatedly exercised this power, and
that it was expressly amrmed by the
twenty-second joint role of the two
Houses, Chandler's order, and the
purpose manifested by his elasm of po
liticians to hold on to the Govern
moat nla virtue of the frads
to be perpetrated . nder it,.
created mauch excitemeat; and there
was some talk, by irrepressible per
sons, of meeting the attempt with
force. But Mr. Tildena, the chosen
leader of the party, and President
elect, and therefore entitled to li.
dicate the plan of action tobe pure
seed to consumamte the purpot, i the
people to make him Presidentais

accepted by the party.

conMeerted ery. that peace depended. a
upon its immediate adoption; sad li
hence even Mr. Tildea himself was fil
not permitted to know anything about te
it until thle party leaders in Congress a
had resolved to report it to thbe Se.- el
ate within two days; and he was then ii
'told he would not be allowed to make g
any objection to the substance of the ca
measure, but only to suggest amend. N
ments as to details! This, of cogrse, ti
be declined doing, seeing at a glnoee ri
that the bills trreadered the election, N
and so be informed the members of a
the Committee deputed to submit it tI
to him. The truth is that the Eleo- a
toral bill was not thought of until it
was found that Mr. Conkling would t
not allow Hayes to be made Presi- d
deat Ly the President of the Senate, n
and that Tilden's insatallation was as
sared ifte onstitutional and custo. B
mary aof of counting the electoral e
vote was adhered to. It has been e
supposedy in the early part of the a
session, hLat the Senate would assert o,
the right of its President to copnt the C
vote; and Southern men enough to tI
centrol the House had agreed to al- 1
low Hayes to be made President in a
that way; and It was only when this w
programme was found impracticable, p
rom Mr. Conkling's opposition, that
the Electoral bill, suggested by him
to avoid an issue between him and D
hib party, was accepted by them, be. ,
cause it would effect the same re- b
suit.
NegotIatIons had been opened with d
Hayes before Congress met and ia
an interview at that time with CoL .
Roberts (the friend of' Mr. Lamar,n
Chairman of the Democratic caucus), l
as it was then publicly reported, he
r sed to recogniae the Southern
n 1 as the representative men of
Sthe South, and to put one or two of a
them in his Cabinet. Strong articles
were also published at that time In a
'the Cincinnati (ndlte and the Hart.

sanctioning this ptroposal. The sub. h
sequent literal execution of. these
terms not only puts beyond aquestion

are now attempting to shirk respoan a
sibility for it, and have even the ef. I
frontery to impute it to Tilden, and a
to say that we should now nominate It
a wan who will takethe ofeice when I
elpted I This language sounds well I,
is the mouths of those who diste. r
garded the Constitution and the pre- a
cedents ounder it, laid before them by i
Mr. Tildea, concealed their purpose a
till everything had been arranged to t
rush the bill through, and notified t
Mr. Tilden that nothing he could sa ii
would chanoge that purpose, for by it t
they pronounced their own condem. 6
nation. r
The object of the chief actor in this I
transaction Is fully revealed in the a
determination that Mr. Tilden shouald i1
not be the candidate of the party for e
the succession. Having defeated the
Republicaso in the election and seo
cured the solid South, they thought e
that possession of the Federal Gov- I
ernment was assured them by their t
own men, aided by Tamai , the
Cansa Ring, and kindred itsrestl in
the Notth; and accordinly 'Mr.'
Bayard-who was bchiefly inLstrumen. '
tal in organizing the Commission ;
whoy a be said to have been bore I
politically of slavery, for natil that
question was used to consolidate thet
south; Delaware had never cast a
Democratic vote-is amwed for the
succession by Mr. Lamar, claiming to
be backead b the solid* South and
Tammany and the. Canal Ring Lose-r C
lilyuaaespnd.
orse they still denounce the b
fraud. But what signifies the do. t
nnaciation of fraud by those whoe
abandon the candidate elected by the 0
people, and in whose person the peo* t
ple have been defrauded I It needsn
no argamet to show that those who
co-operate with Jay Goauld, Twaia
yr, and the Canal BRng to supesnede
Tilden are seeking to give fraud a
new triumaph. When, by a coalition
of his opponents, Jackson was de- d
feted in violation of the will of the r
people, every Demoorat Ia the land
rallied to his support for the neat
teram, as the effective way to vindli I
ate popular rights. If this was nee
