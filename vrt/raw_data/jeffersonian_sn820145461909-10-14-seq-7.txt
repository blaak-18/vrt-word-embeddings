we deny them the right to citizen
ship; for citizenship in its true sense
embodies a full understanding of all
political and social conditions.
I know some of us have been fed
so long on flower-wreathed rhetoric
and imaginary prosperity and a mil
lenium-dawn condition of things,
that our faculties extend no welcome
to the term “slavery”, as applied to
our own country; yet it exists. A
worse form of slavery is not to be
found than that where white women,
like unto your own wife and daugh
ters, are bought and sold in New
York City, and forced to a servitude
that eclipses hell in its blackness.
And the black brute purchasers defi
antly boast of this practice.
I know some of us are inclined to
ward off the term “traitor”, when
applied to your representatives in
Congress. We say, “It’s going too
far; it’s too extreme.” Read the
back numbers of the Jeffersonian and
you will see how a number of Demo
cratic senators and representatives
forsook their own party pledges and
lined up with the Republicans to fas
ten upon the people a tariff system,
a protection and trust-builder to the
manufacturer and a curse to the con
sumer. Even to handle these men in
the gentlest, tenderest and most lov
ing manner would inevitably force us
to reach the conclusion that they are
traitors. And why not be honest
and call them by their right names?
If John D. Rockefeller and other
trust magnates steal millions of the
people’s money on watered stock,
must we say, “John D. took my mon
ey, but he’s all right, just the same?”
The law calls him a thief behind
his back, but not to his face. But
a thief he is, nevertheless.
So these are some of the sad con
ditions which we must meet. Must
we touch lightly these national evils
and abuses, lest we stir their depths,
and make turbulent the mighty wa
ters? I contend that they be ex
posed. I insist that the people be
educated; for in an awakening of the
people lies the adjustment of these
evils and the cleansing of the temple
of justice.
In conclusion, I ask Mr. Watson
to lift high the curtain! Open wide
the door! Turn on the footlights;
and let us see this sickening drama
to a finish; for it is a play in real
life. On the one hand is special priv
ilege; on the other, the people. Will
the people never turn hero? On the
one hand is deceit, fraud and cor
ruption; on the other hand is pa
tience, endurance and unrest. We
watch every act. What will the cli
max be? Finally the curtain rises
for the last act. A process of refor
mation is being prosecuted by the
ballot, until at last reform conquers,
the curtain falls, and an avalanche
of applause sweeps the earth, from
the mountains to the seas.

ONE OF THE MISSIONARY PAM
PHLETS WILL DO IT.
Dear Sir: —I am a missionary Bap
tist, and I stand right with you in
your awakening of the people as to
the reckless expenditure of money in
foreign nations. That money might
do some good at home by educating
and Christianizing our own people,
especially the foreigners in our
midst. When I look over the world,
and read the papers about what is
going on, I am not astonished that
the old prophet Isaiah said, in the
fifth chapter, fourteenth verse, “Hell
hath enlarged herself and opened her
mouth without measure.”
I am one-eyed; it cost me one hun
dred and seventy dollars to get the
cataract off of one eye. I shall send
twenty-five cents in this letter, if the
mail-carrier will take it, which you
can use in opening some one else’s
eyes.
With due regards, I am your broth
er in Christ, D. S. LOYD.
Reliance, Texas.
“LOVES THE JEFFERSONIAN.’’
Dear Sir: —I love the Jeffersonian,
for it is asking and striving for the
God-given rights of the people, and
as it makes its weekly visits, I re
joice to read and circulate its noble
and grand sentiments among my
brethren and sisters.
I am thankful that so many true
women are speaking through the
press of today. I hope others will
take courage to demand their rights
for their posterity.
We must stand unyielding in de
fense of our principles, both re
ligious and political. There is no
time to cavil over loss of money or
friends. We can not depend upon
name or society that does not sustain
our liberties.
Yours for the right,
R. H. JOHNSTON.

CAN’T DO BUT ONE THING AT A
TIME, BROTHER.
Dear Brother Watson: —I am de
lighted with you and your work on
the mission question. “Truth crushed
to earth shall rise again,” and your
work is one of the very finest ex
amples of that truth I ever saw.
I have longed and prayed for this
for fifteen years. God bless you!
I note what you say about “Lec
turing” and “Introductions”.
Would you consider a proposition
to come to Arkansas and speak a
few pieces on “Foreign Missions” and
“Socialism”? We can arrange a rip
snorting programme for you, and
there will be something doing, too.
We have recently had a “debate on
Socialism” in Argenta, North Little
Rock. The “Mission Question” is
red-hot in Arkansas and Texas, in
fact all over the South. I can ar
range twenty lectures for you on
Foreign Missions in as many central
points, and put you in good hands all
the way.
We have a “General Association”,
which meets with the First Baptist
Church here on December 13-15.
Churches from ten States repre
sented. Also a State Association,
which meets at Forest City, Ark.,
November 12th, or thereabout. About
one thousand messengers from
churches all over Arkansas. If you
can arrange to be at Forest City and
then fill in places up to the General
Association here in December, we can
give you a rousing hearing all along
the line, and the benefit will be mu
tual. Would want you in Tennessee
and Kentucky, and hit ’em going and
coming in Alabama and Mississippi.
Think it over quick and let me know.
We can advertise the programme
fully, and there will be something
doing in Dixie. We don’t want you
to limit your work to the pen. Your
3effersonlan
tongue is too eloquent and your heart
too warm for you to be silent.
I insist, I beg you, throw yourself
into the battle for ecclesiastical
righteousness and go after the
hearts as well as the heads of your
fellows. America has reached priest
craft all along the line, among Bap
tists as well as other peoples, and the
nttle for liberty and righteousness
is bottomed on Jesus Christ and the
ethics of regeneration. Come over
and help us! I believe there is an
unspoken word in your heart, way
down deep, too deep for utterance
until you give yourself to it, body
and soul, with holy abandon. No
man can love men and truth as you
do unless he first loves God and the
eternal principles of righteousness,
th, justice. And no mortal can do
that unless he “knows God and
Christ” by the spirit of God.
Don’t you put me down as a crank!
I love you, and I want to tell you so
now. And then there is a cause I
love—God’s cause, and if I could but
speak the word and have it so, I
would have your eloquent tongue
ring out the glad message of the
Gospel of Christ— in all its wonder
ful meaning—spiritual, political, so
cial, commercial—all over our sunny
South. Try a course of lectures on
this line—l promise we will not call
you a preacher—just “Lecturing”.
Try it I beg, and then judge. You
will reach hearts as well as heads,
and then you will know. You have
“crossed the Rubicon”, and if polit
ical and ecclesiastical despotisms can
crush you, they will do it. You have
stirred up the ire of the “priesthood”
and they will “crucify” you if they
can. Now do the rest—meet them
and plant your name and your work
in the hearts of men, and then living
or dying victory is yours.
What do you say?
Yours sincerely,
J. A. SCARBORO.
