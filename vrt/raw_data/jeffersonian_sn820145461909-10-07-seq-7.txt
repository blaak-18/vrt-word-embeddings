signed to them. Inspections of the
different halls has been grossly neg
lected, because, it seemed to me, that
those intrusted with this work were
too lenient. I have no ill-will
against any of the employees individ
ually, but there have been men to
tally unfitted to be attendants
during my time. The head attend
ants knew this, but seemed to shield
their neglect, and, in fact, some of
the head attendants became desper
ately in need of watching themselves.
In 1907 there were five cooks in
stituted, all white. The head cook
got a salary of $1,500 a year, board
and washing. Others got $65 per
month. The cooking was no better.
The coffee is a horrid substitute. I
have found meat rotton, stinking
badly after being cooked; still know
ing this food to be unfit to eat, it
was placed before the demented un
fortunates, who would eat it and af
terwards be taken very ill. I men
tion this, as comment has been made
on the wholesomeness of the food. Dr.
W. F. Brunner, whom I was speak
ing to several months ago, admitted
to me that a decent dog would hard
ly eat the food. This is certainly
true. I have gone hungry days and
days, eating nothing from breakfast
until night.
Hiding true conditions from the
public is a thing that has often been
done, as is proven by the disclos
ures of the Florida Asylum four years
ago, and the Alabama Asylum two
years ago—where the treatment was
horrible. We all remember the dis
closures made by the investigation
into the New York Asylum two years
ago, when it was found that the
nurses and physicians all retired for
the night, leaving the sick at the
mercy of providence.
Some such conditions prevail at
the Georgia Asylum. A watchman
engaged there for fifteen years slept
at least four nights in the week, and
was only discharged a year ago. I
beat on my door with a shoe one
night for over three hours, and never
did a watchman respond. A patient
across from my room was very ill
and called upon me. Aly room being
locked, I could do nothing.
Bear with me further. On bath
ing day at the asylum, all the pa
tients, excepting a few, are compelled
to use the same water. I reported
this once, in'l9o2, to Dr. Jones, now
Superintendent, at that time physi
cian to the Green building, now occu
pied by women. Dr. Jones gave or
ders that each man be given clean
water, but it was never followed out.
A well in the back yard of the conva
lescent building, where the sewage
empties, has been steadily used up to
fifteen months ago, while the attend
ants drank water from a spring. Dr.
Brunner went before the Legislature
in 1905 and helped to secure an ap
propriation for water, but Governor
Smith cut Dr. W. F. Brunner’s head
from the Board of Trustees and he
was one of the most valuable acqui
sitions they had. Fulton county poli
ticians run the Georgia Asylum, not
the people. Respectfully,

A NOBLE LETTER FROM A GOOD
MAN.
My Dear Sir and Brother:—l have
just read your editorial on Socialism.
I thank you for it; and thank God
for the man who wrote it.
I hope, and somehow believe, that
you are yet to do the greatest work
of your life. To my way of think
ing, you are the best friend and
greatest benefactor the great mass of
toiling people in the South have, and
I trust that your influence may
strengthen and enlarge with the
passing -weeks.
For the great amount of good
that you are doing, I overlook and
forgive that thrust you gave me in
this week’s issue of the weekly Jef
fersonian. Brother, if I believed
the Foreign Mission Board of the
Southern Baptist Convention main
tains “the system which hires a
heathen to wear the name of Christ”
I should hasten to endorse all that
you have said on the subject of For
eign Missions, except upon two
points. I do believe that you
make the aim of missions as
taught by our Lord and His
spirit-guided apostles too limited.
And again, while I believe many
who have never heard the oral gos
pel, or ever read the printed one,
wfill be, and have been, saved, I yet
do not believe that it was because
they lived up to the best light that
they have. All who are saved, of
whatever time or clime, are saved by
the atonement wrought by our Lord
Jesus Christ. That is true, or the
Bible is false. But, whilst the sal
vation of the world is absolutely de
pendent upon the death and resur
rection of Christ, that is by no means
to affirm that God is shut up to the
human voice and printers’ ink to
make effective the salvation thus
wrought out, to an earnest soul
hungering for righteousness and
seeking God.
Enough of that. I am glad that
you are writing. Every enterprise
rightly based will eventually be
helped by more light; and every en
terprise wrongly based and improp
erly conducted ought to be thorough
ly made manifest, and especially to
those upon whom they call for sup
port.
Finally. If you have conceived the
idea that I would circumscribe your
influence, or blunt the edge of any
truth that you have written or spok
en, you have misread me.
I have known something of you
since 1880; and from that time until
190 9, I have never united with the
crowd who would pelt and persecute
you: nor shall I at this date. At
different times, and upon different
subjects I have not agreed with you;
but I have always honored you, and
reserved the right consistently to
say: “Air. Watson may be right and
I wrong.’’
Praying God to spare you yet
many years to serve him by enlight
ening the people that are my people,
whom I love, and for whom I labor,
I beg to subscribe myself,
Your true friend and brother,
LaGrange, Ga. A. B. VAUGHAN.
Ed. Comment: I sincerely appre
ciate Rev. Dr. Vaughan’s letter. But
I made no thrust at him in last
week’s paper. The thrust was at the
system which he has been defending.
Before I get through with the presen
tation of the facts, I hope to have
such splendid men as Dr. Vaughan
and Dr. Burrows on my sijle.

ANOTHER LETTER FOR THE CON
SIDERATION OF YOUNG
MEN’S LEAGUE.
Dear Sir:—l w’ish to say that I
agree with Air. Joel R. German, of
Albertville, Ala., that the age limit
is too low. Let’s make it thirty-five
years instead of twenty-one.
I am ever your true friend,
R. E. SMITH.

HAS GOD A PLAN?
As there is a page set apart for
letter-writers, wherein the people
may express their views on live is
sues, without fear, favor or com
promise,' I proceed to give some
thoughts on the much ventilated sub
ject, “Foreign Missions.”
In spite of all the eloquence of
those who have given “years of their
consecrated lives to service among
pagans,” the fact remains that “the
earth is the Lord's and the fullness
thereof.” To say that this mighty
God, who never had a beginning, nor
creation, nor never will cease to ex
ist, did not know the end, the cli
max, the sequel, as well as the be
ginning of all His works, w r ould be to
say that He is a weakling, a finite
creature.
God is the architect of the uni
verse. Has God a plan? None dare
deny it. Can our returned mission
aries give us its outline? Is it His
plan that one was to be called to for
eign fields for a season or number
of years, then quit the battle and
leave the converts to be swallowed
alive by the God of Buddha, or crush
ed by the car of the Juggernaut?
How dare they suit their own incli
nations in this matter of such im
port—“converting the world for
Christ,” as they call it? Tell us, O
you tired missionary, if it be so that
one poor heathen drops into a Devil’s
Hell at every swing of the clock’s
pendulum, how dare you to cease the
arduous fight for souls until you shall
fall prostrate upon the battle’s front?
Tell us, do you believe, really, that
God is dependent upon what you and
a few Christian’s dollars can do for
the salvation of billions, dead and liv
ing, who never heard of the “only
name given whereby we can be
saved?” Oh, what will become of
them? Stop. Let reason have a
part in this contest. Did God know
all things “before the world was?”
Did He see our parents in Eden?
Did He see the tempter as he stealth
ily beguiled them? Did He foresee
the fall and contamination of the
race? Did He look down the ages
and behold paganism in its worst
forms? Did he hear, by a mighty
sweep into futurity, the wail of Chi
na’s little girls as they suffered the
cgonies of “bound feet,” or the
moaning, groaning millions of India's
“child wives” and “child widows,”
or beheld the thousands who, by
fetish rights and superstition, have
willingly given their bodies to be
crushed or burned upon the funeral
pyre? O people, did God know
that, after nineteen hundred years of
missionary endeavor, the earth would
be swarming with heathens? Statis
tics say that a hundred years ago
there were six hundred millions of
pagans, and today there are twelve
hundred millions! Now, take your
pencil and commence to figure how
long before the church (so called)
at this rate will “win the world to
Christ.” When you have figured
hundreds of millions of years, then
write the word —Never! But God has
a plan for the redemption of the race
—surely he must have, planned for
more than about one out of a million
to be saved. Has He planned the
damnation of all others? I will not
believe it. Neither do you, my
friends. What then is the plan for
the salvation of the heathen?
Please read my next letter—“ Plan
for the Heathen.”
Faithfully,
H. STACY.
Boston, Ga.
WISH THE JEFERSONIANS WERE
“HOUSEHOLD NECESSITIES”
IN MORE HOMES.
I have taken all your periodicals
from the establishment of the Peo
ple's Party Paper up to the present.
They are household necessities.
Your articles in reply to Secretary
Dickinson and the Northern press
sounded pleasant (to say the least
of it) to an old Confed like myself,
who served through the war in the
Fifteenth North Carolina regiment,
and reluctantly surrendered at Appo
mattox.
Your articles on Foreign Alissions
are simply immense. They have only
to be read to be appreciated by a fair
minded public. I would be proud if
a million copies could be placed in
the hands of the people.
You are certainly doing a great
work, —as I view it; have no equal
among reformers of the present day.
You have quite a number of staunch
friends in this community. Your cir
culation will be increased soon from
this point.
May you live long to battle for the
rights of languishing humanity, and
before you are called to the great
beyond, enjoy the full fruition of
your hopes and desires.
In closing, would say, “Lay on Alac
duff,” etc. E. W. AIcBRAYES.
The Veterans 9 Corner
(Concluded from Page 3)
would have been preserved, State
rights vindicated, the right of each
State to local self-government estab
lished, the Constitution saved, cen
tralism and its forebodings obviated
and the negro question settled for
ever. The slavery that existed would
have been gradually abolished, for
civilization had pronounced its doom.
It would have been abolished by evo
lution, instead of by revolution as it
was. It would have been abolished
with fairness to the material inter
ests of the master and with justice
and humanity to the slave. With
the abolition of slavery ail the States,
North and South, would have per
ceived a common interest and a com
mon destiny; the irresistible law of
political gravitation would have
drawn them together again as in the
time of the Revolution, and cemented
them into an indissoluble Union
grander and more glorious than the
Union of today. Had the South tri
umphed there would have been no
Fifteenth Amendment; there would
have been no negro suffrage; there
would have been no Reconstruction
with all its attendant horrors; there
would have been no infamous and
diabolical attempts to prostrate
Southern valor, Southern manhood
and Southern virtue at the feet of a
hostile, alien and servile race.”
