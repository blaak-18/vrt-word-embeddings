Ballot box stuffing where Populists
are concerned must stop or there will
be lots of fun.
An old party leader's record is like a
skunk, the more you handle it, the
more It smells.
John G. Carlisle may be nominated
by the Democrats, but that is all that
will come of it.
Patience is a great virtue and reform
ers must practice it until we can turn
the rascals out.
The honest intentions of the mudsil
ler are almost sure to be right. He
knows no guile.
Prejudice is the old party leader's
badge, and it is a fit emblem of their
crushing ignorance.
Old party leaders will have plenty of
time in which to consult, plan and rest
after the next election.
Prejudice is as awet blanket to you;
lay it aside and let the mind be free
and be a free man again.
The. question is often asked in a
whisper by the pie eaters: "How long
will the mudsillers stand it?"
Let every reformer stand pat. In
vite all men to join us in our crusade
for right, justice and equality.
"The grand old Democratic party"
a dream only, that has an abiding place
in the fond recollections of men.
You never saw a bee light on a gourd
vine blossom, or knew an old party
leader that would tell all he knew.
When will Hon. J. H. Reagan write
another letter to the Populists begging
them to go back to the Democratic par

A Cleveland "cockoo" is the dirtiest
bird of al. Buasard-like, it has neither
conscience, honor nor a sense of pro

Push the campaign unti the National
Convention, July 22. Then follows our
state conention on Aug. 5 and a red-hot
campaign.
Judge John H. Reag used to be the
master political hypotiser of Texas,
but the old gentleman seems to have
lost his power.
The idea that the Reptiblcan party
Is a friend to silver and monetary re
form Is ridlculousf even laughable to
men who reason.'
Mr. John G. Carlisle will deliver a
I"non-partisan" speech to the working
men of Chicago, April 15. Will won
lers never cease?
The little Democratic seed tick pol
tilcans of Texas can't ind a suitable
sprig to cluster around. They are in
clined to scatter.
The uistsea of any government have
just eause for suspiciLo and appre

ft the masses had more the classes
would have much less, and all would
be better off.
The national banking scheme is the
most unholy alliance that any set of
men ever encouraged. The system is
the most expensive to the people of any 1
that could be devised. It is gradual
conflstication.
There are too many loop holes in the
law, too many advantages for the rich,
too much delay, too little respect for
our courts, too much rascality prac
ticed, too much cost for so slight a ser
vice. The whole judiciary systemn is
out of joint. But it suits the lawyers.
No one is suprised in the least at the
announcement of Hon. John G. Car
lisle for president. He is Cleveland
and Sherman's candidate, and his plat
form is "soun' money," more bonds,
more national banks, single gold stand
ard, and retiremnt of all paper money
except bank notes.
And "Old Uncle Dave" Culberson i%
again a candidate for congress; an4
Charles A., the failure, wants to be
governor again; and in the meantime
"Bobby" Culberson will draw pay from 1
Uncle Sam as a prosecuting attorney.
The Culbersons are in if. Better turn
over the state to them.
What is the trouble? Bell, Crowley,
Hutchinson, Yoakum, Cockrell and
Pendleton say they will not again be
candidates for congress. Who ever
heard of a Democrat quitting office be
fore until he was choked off? What is
the matter? Are the Populists too
numerous to suit them?
Cleveland succeeded in defeating or
rather preventing the election of Black
burn as senator from Kentucky, and
now that the legislature has adjourn
ed, Gov. Bradley (Republican) can ap
point one of his partisans. But then
what lathe difference between a Dem
ocrat and a Republican, anyhow?
Some one should prepare a raw
hide band for Mr. Dudley's head, put it
on wet, stand him out in thb sum till
it dries, and thus save him from an in
curable case of awell-head. He has it
pretty bad now, but it won't aggravate
him so after the People's party- get
through with his congressional as
piratlon.
It now seems that a combine has
been made between the Republican
manufactures of the East and the Re
publican silver senators of the West
for protection and silver. It was sup
posed that those Western senators
were too smart to walk into such a
trap. After the election is over, silver
will be set down on again.
"Chrstianity secures both the prl
ate interests of men and the public
peace, enforcing all justice and equity,"
said Tillotson. Yes, but ther is so lit
tle of Christianity practiced in prvpor
tion to the amount professed in this
day and time that Justice is dethroned
and equity banished by the pretenders.
Judge Rafe Hardy will be found
:,t the proper time in the rush for the
pie counter. He has eat taxes so-long
that he just can't help it. He is like
tl:e little boy who at the table had bdea
helped to preserves twice and watited
more. His mother said: "Whys son,
you should eat eugnthtag else." He re
plied: "Me wals - mere 'zerves. We
lorte 'ibi.' eeWi40Mu 'O." So it
is with our Democratic pie eaters; they
want more, and more.

From the St. Louis Fvening Journal. I
Presidents, senators, high nmurk-a
mucks in the social and political worlt
from home and abroad, including Scrof
ulous heiress huntres from run-down
estates in Europe, and upstart politi
cians recently promoted from the gutter
to the judiciary for devoted syco
phantcy to the vested interests-these
and others of their ilk are now inter
viewed and held up to public view by
the daily papers, and their every re
mark reported and every action noted
so assiduously that the millions-that is
the every day fellows like you and me
have almost forgotten that we exist.
We see the members of the official and
social ring quoted so often that we have
come to think that they are the country,
the people, and when they say "we" or
"us" or "our," we common people get
confused and think we are In it. They
do the talking, for they own the sources
ef information. We the millions, have
no organs and are dumb. So when
when they are having a good time the
country is prosperous, when they gorge
themselves God is good, when they get
into a senseless quarrel with the same
breed across the water our country
must prepare for war and when one of
their yoeungsters has the stomach ache
bad weather is prophesied. But we.
the people who have been left out in
the cold have a mouth-piece now in
the Daily Journal, and we are going to
speak through it and be interviewed
;ourselves. Those of us who have sor
rows are going to tell how we think
they came upon us and give any advice
we wish, to others in 4anger of Ills
that may be prevented.
A Journal man met an old soldier
coming out of the postomce yesterday
and as he did not claim the title of col
onel interviewed him.
"Ha I get anything to say to the
public?" he ejaculated It answer to the
first inquiry. "I should think I have.
I have enough to say that if the peo
ple would listes to me and had hearts
instead of grisley blood pumps they
would rise against their present rulers
before tomorrow.
"I went to the war as a healthy sart
young man, from a pleasant home and
even left 'my sweetheart, to give my
life to save my country. I generously
laid my all on the altar of patriotism
and when I returned'home wounded
and only a wreck of a man I found
'that the country I thought I was saving
had been captured in the rear by a band
of scheming traitors headed by John
Sherman. I worked hard to make a
living but because I would nbt become
a partner to the rascals who looted the
I publico treasury to enrich national
banks, I was refused a pension.
"Last year my only daughter who all
her mfi has been devoted to me and
armed me like a angel through every
Wiates and who used to sit up nights
to make me dellcacies-she was forced
to work in a factory on Washington
avenue. The imls' soo took a liking to
her and I don't blame him for she was
the loveliest creature you ever laid eyes
en. He told her bel* rett? she was
Ssand she wos tooled late thinking he
was going to marry her. He came to
our house many times, and I knew he
meant to marry her. I knew he was C
good-iatantioned fellqw agd egaerous,
but his grisly old dad said he would
disinherit him if he did. My daughter
used to tell me with her arms around
ny amek al the tldngs she was going
to 40o for mp when she married Fred.
r But one day she came home as pale as
death. She said she was sick. I
knew she was sick in her mind and got
Sher t to tell me that her sihewheart was
not gong to marry hr. I thought Lis
was all, poor child, hut one week later
she did not return ope nlgiht, and told
.me in a note that she was not worthy
to live with me any more, ad' that I
wbuld never see her again. The poor

nal man saw an old omabn writipg on
a postal card, hut after she w ouli writ.,
each word she had to stop :ad wipn
the tears from her eyes. She fMst ro
sented being asked the cause of her sor
row. but after being assiured she wa:n
talking to a friend explained that she
had raised a family of three bright
boys, but all were now dead, and that
although they once o noel their own
home and store, doing a prosperous
business, the millionaire's depart:nment
store had caused their failure, and nov
she apd her aged Invalid husband were
about to be separated and sent to tIw,
different charitable houses for the aged.
My youngest boy, killed himselU f by ot.r
work trying to make the business go
and when he saw we were all going
under in spite of his efforts, he I'ty
right down on his bed and died in d"
lirious fever. And to think after los
ing all our children and working tar I
all our lives we must now be searprate I
in our old ago and ho sent to differen'
lastitutions among strangers' ! Oh!
My God it is too much! I wish I were
dead too!"
When asked (f she thought God was
to blame for her misfortune she an
swered: "Oh, no; lie made the world
big enough and rich enough for all."
"Then why is this world filled with eo
much pain and wretchedness?" con
tinued her Interrogator. "I don't know."
she sobbed. "TIs It not all the fault of
those who monopolize the world and
deny the poor the right to earn their
living?" The poor woman looked up in
blank amazement. She had been their
in a -church led by Pharisees, who
had never suggested that God's King
dom was possible on this earth, or that
the preaett bell Is the result of social
and political crimes, a{d so she only
shook her old achlng rfead-she could
not understand. The idea that the
benefit 6f progress- and invention be
longed to all alike, agd that every man,
woman and, chilU in the world might
enjoy an abhni'ttnce f all the good
things of life had never occurred to her.
The poor thin bad cried, "Oh, my
God!" in her misery, never realizing
that God had given her a world of un
limited leAnty ani4 delight, which had
forcibly been taken from her by the
ruling classes: that these people waste
enough in one brutal feast to save the
lives of a bhudred huagry women and
children; that single families squander
in useless ostentation weekly what
would. give comfort, peace and plenty
to a relghborhoed anid that these things
are cr ltt'-for which the pereptrators

for which they shall ver soon have to
