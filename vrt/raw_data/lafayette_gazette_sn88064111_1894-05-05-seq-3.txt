A Run AVway.
Last Tuesday afternoon â€¢ Messrs.
- &dvarti l'cllerin. F. ()lto andl l';iih
Pefferkorn were returning from a
fishing party when the horse hitched
to their buggy took fright and started
at a terrific speed. The three gen
tlemen were precipitated to the
ground, but fortunately without
receiving any serious injuries. The
horse continued his mad race,
passed in front of the court house
going in the direction of the convent.
When Judge Debaillon's office was
reached the buggy collided against
a stump and was broken into several
pieces. The horse was found a few
minutes later in the outskirts of the
town and, strange totsay, he did not
receive a scratch.
Lacour--Couvillon.
Monday morning at io o'clock,
at the St. John's Catholic church,
the Rev. Father Forge united in
marriage Miss Josephine Couvillon
and Mr. Louis E. Lacour. Both
are residents of Lafayette, the bride
being the daughter of Mr. J. C.
Couvillon and the groom a popular
young man and member of one of
the oldest and best Creole families
of Avoyelles parish. A large num
ber of friends had gathered at the
church to witness the nuptial cere
monies. A lovely bevy of convent
girls, schoolmates of the fair bride,
were present and lent charm to the
occasion. At the appointed hour
the bridal party arrived. The bride,
becomingly gowned in cashmere
cream, was led to the altar by her
brother, Mr. Leon Couvillon. Then
came the groom, and with his
groomsmen, Messrs. Edgar and
Pierre Lacour, marched to the altar,
where they met the bride and brides
maids, Misses Anna Couvillon and
Julia Lacour, both daintly dressed.
Father Forge performed the simple
and impressive marriage ceremony
of the Catholic church, which united
the young couple for life. After
the ceremony, the party, consisting
of relatives and friends of the
family repaired to the bride's home,
where a bounteous dinner wasspread.
Among those present were: Mr.
and Mrs. Hilaire Lacour and Messrs.

A Pretty Home.
Iast Monday morning The Ga
sette scribe paid a visit to the future
home of Mr. Walter J. Mouton,
situated in the south-western portion
of this town. When the improve
ments on the house and in
the yards are complleted, Walter
will have one of the prettiest homes
in Lafayette. The remodeling of the
building and addition of the turrets
and baywindows are the work of
the competent carpenters, Sarrazin
Broussard and his son, John. The
front door is strikingly elegant and
neat and speaks highly of the skill and
taste of that artistic workman, Mr.
Numa Broussard. To say that the
papering and painting are equally
well done it is only necessary to
mention the fact that the veteran
painter, H. A. Eastin, is attending
to that part of the work. The
Gazette congratulates its young
friend on his lovely home and ex
presses the hope that he will find in
It much happiness and prosperity.
A Charming Dance.
A charming social event this week was
the complimentary dance at Falk's Opera
H-ouse, given by a number of the young
gentlemen of Lafayette. Nothinmg had been
spared to make this affair an enjoyable one,
atnd the managers are to he congratulated
on the perfect success of their entertainment,
which was one of the most brilliant ever
given in Lafayette. Tile music, wh'ich was
furnished by the Breaux Bridge Band, was
splendid, the rcfreshments were delicious,
and nothing marred the Fleasure of the
occasion. Dancitng was kept up until a late
hour, when all left bearing away with them

A Good Advertisement. .
The lovliest spots in Lafayette
are Father Forge's flower garden
and Mr Hahrn's at the Cresent
News. Passengers on board the
trains never fail to adnmire the
\ariots hcbautifull flowcr.s in the"
Cresent News garden. A gentle
man truthfully reijaarked the other
day that they were a good advertise
ment for this town, as such a pleas
ing sight could not fail to favor
ably impress a stranger with this
section.
Where it is.
A Subscriber: Please decide the follow
ing: A bets B that there is no such railroad
as the Teche Railroad Company in Louis
iana in the neighborhdnd of Abbeville. If
there is, please let us know if it is finished
and where does it begin and finish?
There is no railroad called ,"Teche Rail
road." The road you mean is "'The Salt
Mine Branch and Iberia and Vermillion
Railroad." Is twenty-one miles long and
runs from New Iberia to Abbeville.
The above was taken from the
column of "Questions and Answers"
in Monday's Times-Democrat.
The T. D. is mistken. There is a
railroad called " the Teche Rail
road;" it runs from Carencro, in
this parish, to the i~uron plantation
in the parish of St. Martin.
A Proiest.
A special from Abbeville to the
Times-Democrat of last Wednesday
says:
The police jury d6 this (Verml
ion) parish, held a meeting here to
day and passed a risolutionprotest
ing against the actiin of the police
jury commissioners in assessing
railroads, telephone and telegraph
lines which meetinig was held at
Lafayette. The region given for the
protest is that Velmilion parish's
commissioner was not notified of
the place of meeting, and that the
meeting was not held on the line of
the I. and V. Railroad.
The M. D's Meet.
Drs. J. D. and A. R. Trahan,of this place,
and Lessly and Francez, of Carencrot
attended the meeting of the Attakapas
Medical Association held \Vednesda-' at New
Iberia. Dr. Sabatier of New Ibehria, was
elected president to sueceed Dr. Trahan
whose term has expired. Dr. Le ;sly was
elected vice-president: The Gazet e learns
that the meeting was a very harmo'ious and
successful affair. It was one of the most
instructive and interesting meetings ever held
since the organization of the association.
Ice ! Ice !
Messrs. Harnisch & Pefferkorn
have opened the ice depot opposite
Mr. Pellerin's store where they will
handle ice manufactured by the
Opelousas Ice and 1ottling Works.
If you desire, Ice will be decvered
at your domicile two or thref: times
a day. Orders left with the above
named gentleman at their depot
will be promptly attended to.
Nor a Candidate.
It was reported that State Senator
Avery from this di:strict, hlau- gone
to Washington where he had been
called by President Clevela.el, who
would p1robably appoint hi n post
master at New Orl.,ans. Mr. Avery
returned from Washington this week.
He said to a reporter that lie went
to the capital in the interest of sugar
and that he is not a candidlate for
any Federal ofiice. He will continme
to represent this district in the State
Senate,
More Rixe Mills.
One of the busiest places in town
is the rice mill; it runs continually,
milling daily a large quantity of rice
of a superior quality. Mr. Le
Danois, the propl for and manager,
is a gentleman of fine business
ability and the prosperous condition
of the mill is due to his able mana
gem.ent. Although this is the first
entc:rprise of the kind started in
Lafayette, there was no difficulty in
secu ring a sufficien" quantity of rice
to keep the mill in operation all
the time. The Gazette believes
that two more rice mills in Lafayette
would not be too many. People
having money to invest can not find
a b ctter opportunity. The western
portion of this parish is a splendid
rice country and is not far from the
town, which would be a great in
due-:cment to farriers to sell their
rice here, instead of shipping it to
fo -eign markets, w.hich is very often
aconompanied by great losses and
dclays. If we can not get a refinery,
let; us try and b!sild a rice mill.
Tiiere is enough capital here to do
it. The only thing lacking is enter
prise. A little push and energy,
les s bickering and more pulling
togpether, are the first steps and then
the: enterplrise w-v developl itself.

Troo Much Enterprise.
To the Editor of the Lafayette G;azette:
1Ve have had competition in dry
goods:, groceries, meat, bread and
other necessaries of li.fe, and the
peolple of Lafayet'te hav'e been bene
fited t-ereby, but I fear that this
spirit of competitiol, or rather the
gras:'ag proclivit s of 5)me enter

har~l than good. '4: th.,' poor
ne4C~by, who ig s'tiii'j4Â¢ v:" the

will be swallowed up and deposited
in the voracious maw of the mono
polist. COXEYITE,
Lopez Shdots a Man.
The following account of the
shooting of Romelo near Cade is
taken from the Daily Iberian.
Lopez, who did the shooting, is
known in Lafayette, having worked
here as a barber.. Those who know
him say that he was a well behaved
young man, and they were sorry to
learn of his misfortune.
The shooting of Mr. Joseph
Romero by Mr. Leopold Lopez
Saturday is, of course well known.
Not being able to hear anything
definite or reliable this morning we,
through the kindness of Mr. Sam
Pointes, were admitted to the cell
where Mr. Lopez is confined. Mr.
Lopez, when approached by us,
seemed very willing to talk; from
him we heard the following:
"I don't know how it happened
exactly, I being somewhat under
the influence of liquor. We were
not enemies."
He went on to say that he met
Mr. Romero and others, he being
in a cart having with him a keg of
beer, he called the crowd around
to join him in a drink, which they
all did; after a bit he said, "Let's
have another." Mr. Romero re
fused. He (Lopez) then said, "Any
man that don't want to drink with
me can go to hell. Romero seemed
not to like this much atrid told Lo
pez "Don't you say that again."
Lopez repeated it. Then, Lopez
states, Romero and his brother ad
vanced on him. He could not re
member clearly how the rest hap
pened, but showed his hand, which
he states was cut by one of the
brothers.
Mr. Lopez feels very badly over
the accident. He was told that
though Mr. Romero was danger
ously wounded it would not prove
fatal, he remarked that he hoped
that was the case; he had really
nothing against the man, and if he
was guilty of an offense he was
willing to suffer for it. Romero
died Tuesday.
Bushels of Money.
From a letter written by Leotardo,
the bloodless man who visited Lafay
ette some time ago, to Dr. Trahan,
we earn that this wonderful freak
is at San Antonio, being on his way
to the Mid-winter Fair at San Fran
cisco. He says he is making
"bushels of money."
Royville Items.
From Our RIegular Corespontdent.
-During the past week our little inland
"sea port" has been thronged with visitor;.
Theg balmy and isnvigorating gulf breeze,
combined with that Thospitality characteristic
of Royvillians, at once compels a guests to
feel at home. It is admitted that Royville
is the Mecca of Lafayette.
-N otwithstanding the financial crisis of
the country, the migration of the "''hobo co
horts" to WVashington, the low prices o,f the
"'fleecy staple," cotton is being extentsively
planted. It was sonicme day last week that
your correspondent met a highly esteemed
old farmer from this vicinity. HIe asked
of him, how was it that the farmers were
so enthusiastic over the cotton culture, when
they knew that the prices were killing ? HIis
answer came slowly and quic'ly. Like the
immortal Pope, he said:
"'Ilope springs eternal in the human breast."
WVe are praying and hoping for better
times. We still adhere to old ante-bellum
customs. We care not for diversion of
crops. Cotton is our product and cotton we
will raise. As the old gentleman says: let
us hope!
-Dr. Scranton was called as surgeon,
with Drs. Rand and Weis, to the bedside
of \Ir. Romero, who was shot by Mr. Lo
pez, of Cade, at a ball last Saturday night.
The bullet struck near the 5th rib, sliding
1 and perforating the liver. Mr. Romero died
Monday morning.
-Mrs. Kelly and Miss Eftie Young, of I.a
fayette, spent MIonday with Dr. Young's
family.
~-Mr. P. B. Roy is having an addition
made to his already 1i'rge and commctliotis
home. Mr. Daly, of New Iberia is the con
tractor.
-Mrs. Judice and Miss B. Palmer, of
Lafayette, are the guests of Dr. and Mrs.
Scranton.
-Say, boys! What about organizing a
base ball club ?

merchant, with a bright future ahead. "To
the happy couple we tendler, our best wishes
for a long, happy and prosperous wedded
life.
-The basket picn:e Sulnday laet at Jeffer
son's Island, was one of the most pleasant
affairs of tile season. The members of the
Glee Club did their utmost to make their
guests as comfortablle as possible, and from the
various reports, their untiring efforts were

IThe sail boat ride across the lake was an
enjoyable one. At 4 o'clock a sunmptuous

where they had gone to place in the peni

term of court. Mr. Delhommne informed
The Gazette that he had occasion to see
the white convicts from this parish; he found
them all working. Erwin Meaux and Willie
Foreman were sewing in the tailoring de

years ago for counterfeiting, was also engaged
making men's clotlies; he is said to be an ex

Two Lives Saved.
Mrs. Phoebe Thomas, of Junction City, Ill.
was told by her doctors she had Consumption
and that there was no hope for her, but two
bottles Dr. King's New Discovery completely
cured her and she says it saved her life. Mr.
Thns. Eggers, 139 Florida St. San Francisco,
suffered from a dreadful cold, approaching
Consumption, tried without result everything
else then bought one bottle of I)r. King's
New Discovery and In tw5 weeks was cured.
He is naturally thankful. It is such results,
of which these are samples, that prove the
