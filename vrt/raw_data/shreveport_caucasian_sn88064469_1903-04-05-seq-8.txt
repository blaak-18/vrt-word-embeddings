STREET PAVING.
The action of Mayor Querbes and the
council in devising the ways and means
through which to secure street im
provements is commendable in the high
est degree. Street paving means better
streets, and a city's progress may be
measured by the local pride of its citi
zens. Shreveport is a progressive town,
and therefore must move onward. It is
true that the paving of streets is costly,
but there is compensation in the in
creased valuation of property on the
streets paved and in the satisfaction of
travel over such streets. While there is
some opposition to the paving of some
streets, it is the Caucasian's opinion
that an overwhelming majority in num
ber and in valuation will be recorded
in favor of the bond issue at the elec
tion which is to be held on May 12.
In such an undertaking, in such an en
terprise, no citizen who is concerned in
the development of the city, in the in
crease of property valuation can afford
to be penny-wise and pound-foolish.
CRADLE OF AMERICAN GENIUS.
Eight governors, three United States
senators, three generals of the civil
war, one of. the world's greatest en
gineers, a distinguished painter and
sculptor, two novelists who are read
wherever the English language is
known, a poet whose songs have thrill
ed millions of hearts, a rear admiral
and a gallant commander whose heroic
and tragic death is klown to everyone,
together with almost innumerable state
legislators and a number of financial
magnates constitute Brookville's (Ind.)
contribution to the genius of the world.
Of the eight governors James B. Ray
was the first.-Landon Knight in April
