A Model Farm. the
It was the good fortune of The at
Gazette to spend a eouple of days fo
on the farm of Drs. H. P. Guilbeau mi
& Sons, adjoining the town of Breax ti'
I Bridge, some days since. be
Notwithstanding a large medical si,
practice, these gentlemen find time Ju
to devote well-directed enterprise
and intelligence to the affairs of a
what may truly be called one of the si,
best appointed model farms in south
western Louisiana. of
Besides the cultivation of cotton, `'
0 corn, some sugar cane, and other TC
d farm products, they are devoting lu
e their efforts towards raising fine b,
blooded stock, and have been quite su
successful. of
Only a. few. years ago one could tt
t scarcely see other than scrub stock
r- in that neighborhood, but to-day, "
1 perhaps, not one farmer in a hun
f dred but can show either a fine T
blooded horse or some other thor- it
h oughbred animal, and, we do not
f think we err in stating that the doc- d
it tors were the pioneers in that line. a
At the present. time they have in ci
their stables the celebrated pedi
'- greed horse, Boston, coming from
e an illustrious family ; Barnard C, a p
k. splendid dark bay, with a trotting I
in record of 2:32. made without any
C special training ; and a number of 11
others. Among the horned cattle li
al the most admired is a young Hol
stein bull, who can trace his ances
d try very far back. There are also L
some fine Berkshire pigs, and South- c
down sheep. And to carry out their J
es intention of having only the purest
st strains on the place they have ac
h. pair of setter dogs, bought at a high q
price in. New York, and some game
chickens from Cincinnati. a cock- s
erel and chick costing $i8. TWe (
s- have gone into these details to show c
)y that these gentlemen are wflling to
pay a fair price for their breeding f
animals knowing full well that they
:t- will be amply repaid, as instanced
te in a sale made some time since <
to when they solda three-year-colt to af
he party in North Carolina for $5oo,
which did not cost a hundred to the i
owners when sold. But the -'pride -
n- of the family " is the three-year-old
;r- colt, Le Teche. A thousand dollars
tle was offered and 'refused for this
handsome looking animal. He is
of magnificent proportions and gives
is- every indication of a future full of
grand possibilities.
We took particular pleasure in
in going through the orchard. There
ce we found many fig trees, of the ce
;ar leste and Smyrna variety, the latter
a rare and deliciously sweet fruit ;
rs pear trees, Japan and other varieties
of plums, Japan persimmons, pea
LY, ches. and some magnificent orange
ot, trees well laden with ripening fruit.
ig, In short the variety of fruit on this
ast place are so many that we cannot
mention them all within the limits
of this necessarily short article.
ed From the orchard to the field is
ast but a few steps. The first thing that
strikes the view is a field of oats and
adjoining is a sorghum tract. In
i- the rear is the cotton, corn, etc,,
en field, and all the crop look very
ur promising.
he But to us the most interesting
4r.'thing on the place, and which
showed long-headed wisdom on the
en part of the owners, is the 5oo thir
Ve teen-year-old pecan trees. This, in
ri- a few years, will give a splendid
all revenue.
There are many other things on
vo this fine farm, but what we have
ral written will give an idea, though an
the imperfect one, to the reader, as to
ev- the state of things on this splendid
farm. It is worth seeing, and re
fault will be found with the hospi
tality of the owners. On this point
we speak knowingly.
