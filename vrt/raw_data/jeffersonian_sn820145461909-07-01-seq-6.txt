WANTS A CONFERENCE.
Dear Sir: —You will find enclosed
money order for $1 for renewal to
the Weekly Jeffersonian. Send me
your premium knife.
I am in favor of holding a confer
ence in the effort to unite all of the
labor forces into one body. Let’s see
if we cannot gain some relief. It
looks like the two old parties are
gradually closing in on us all the
time until it is almost impossible to
make a living in the honest way that
our Creator said to do it, —by the
sweat of our brow r .
I have always stood for reform
ever since I have been voting, and
ever expect to remain on that
ground.
I am well pleased with your ideas
on Foreign Mission work. We need
a lot of Home Mission work, especial
ly in Kentucky. It looks like it is
costing so much this year to live,
and the price of tobacco is so low
that it is a hard struggle to make
tongue and buckle meet.
Wishing you all success, I am,
Yours for success,
J. W. STORY.
Hazel, Kentucky, Route 1.
WHAT ABOUT AUTOMOBILE
ROADS?
My Dear Sir:—Your recent letter
relative to Road Improvement duly
received, but absence from home has
caused an earlier reply to be de
layed. lamat a loss to express my
sentiment personally about road en
thusiasm and results. Four-fifths of
our country people are sorely con
fused over the cyclone-like revival
of road improvement. You see road
work by taxation has been a disap
pointment, generally speaking, as it
seems—or rather, is claimed —that
undue partiality exists in the road
work. Then came the convict sys
tem of only some two and a half
months ago, which has arrayed citi
zens and neighborhoods suspiciously
against each other, caused by the
claim that one section is being ac
commodated at the expense of an
other. In fact, the results will be
so long off that the wrangle must
continue.
Now come the cities and towns
all combined for automobile roads,
with their fussy agents tooting their
horns, scattering advertisements in
front of every mansion, residence
and cabin on the various roads, and
this has rattled the senses of our
people generally. In fact, not since
secession have the people had such a
shock as is now being administered
to them. All kinds of alarming ru
mors are being circulated as to what
it all means, ana certainly the en
thusiasm from New York to the
Florida shore could not be second
to what would have been witnessed
had the Confederacy gained its inde
pendence. Every man here has his
own theories, and all are busy giving
exhibitions of the coming future, —
some with automobiles, others with
out them.
. The latest scare is that the coming
session of the Legislature intends to
tax all of our lands from 50 cents to
$2.50 an acre —as to location—to
build these roads for the use of the
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
rich to ride on, and the poor to look
on and wave handkerchiefs at. Our
common road-tax now is $3.50; with
the information that the county will
have to issue bonds to pay the ex
penses of convict work, and then
land tax for automobile purposes is
enough to make a poor and already
involved farmer scratch his head and
meditate.
As enthusiasm develops that
is worth notice, I will write you.
Sincerely,
CITIZEN.
DID CONGRESS HAVE THE RIGHT?
Dear Sir: —I have almost lost all
hope when we have hundreds of men
in Congress and their sacred oath has
no influence on them. What is to
become of our Government when it
is in control of men that will perjure
themselves for a mess of pottage.
Eevery man that accepted that sal
ary grab ought to be sent to a con
vict farm for five years.
Where did Congress get the right
to take the people’s money out of
the treasury to build 5,000 gift
houses for Italy? Is it Constitu
tional? Did any other government
make such gifts to Italy? Guess
not. They know better.
Our President and Congress is very
particular about labor organizations
restricting trade, and then build a
damnable impenetrable tariff wall
around our continent to make serfs
and slaves of the people in order to
satiate the greedy appetite of the
American manufacturer. The people
pay double the tariff on American
manufactured goods than if they
could buy direct from Europe. The
tariff rules out foreign goods, and
the manufacturer and merchants
take advantage of it. If the tariff
is one dollar, they raise the price
from two to four. The lumber we
paid $8 for when there was no tariff,
we now pay sl2 for. I sawed my
self, and know what I am talking
about, and it paid me at that price
handsomely. If the Government
abolished the National Banking Sys
tem, and issued the money direct and
controlled the currency, the interest
the people pay would pay all Govern
ment expenses, economically admin
istred, and take the tax off the peo
ple, there would be no use for a tariff
for revenue.
I am nearly 81 years old, —an old
rebel soldier, and rebel yet.
Very truly yours,
R. H. WEIRSR.
Newton, Miss.
My Dear Sir:—My father has been
a subscriber to your periodicals from
the People’s party paper down to the
present, and I have been a close
reader of them ever since I began
to notice affairs political. It is in
deed refreshing to look back over all
the years and see how you have ever
been on the firing line, always where
the fight was the thickest, never
swerving from the straight path of
duty, inviting opposition and ridi
cule, courting political disaster for
the sake of upholding principle when
you had only to hold out your hand
to be crowned with success as the
world sees it.
Jeffersonian
The fact that you have gone up ’
against this mountain of ignorance
and indifference shows your courage,
but your blows are telling, to my
knowledge, and you are making
friends and converts. Os course some
of them are too weak-kneed to come
out in the open. The party lash has
not lost any of its terror in poor
boss-ridden Louisiana, and there are
yet plenty of Daddy Democrats who
would lick the hand that smites
them for the sake of a smell of the
pie counter.
The prospect certainly looks dim
for anything like an organized re
form movement in this State soon.
The few old faithfuls are so hope
lessly in the minority that they
haven’t the energy to make a move.
Even the Farmers’ Union is on the
drag, and a total collapse sees in
evitable.
But it is said that every cloud has
its silver lining and that the darkest
hour is just before dawn. Surely the
dawn is near.
I am no hero worshiper, and do’
not believe in following blindly
where others lead, but I am proud of
you, a son of Southern soil, because
of your loyalty to principle and your
high place among the intellectual
giants of the world, and I write this
because I think we should not save
all the roses to scatter over the
senseless clay which covers the form
in which dwelt the spirit whose dark
est hour might have been brightened
by a word or deed which we with
held.
Here’s hoping that the years that
perhaps lie before me may see vic
tory perched upon the banner that
our gallant leader has flung to the
breeze.
Most sincerely yours,
J. R. BELTON.
Simsboro, La.
IT WOULD BE TURNING BACK TO
CHANGE NAME.
Dear Sir:—l am prodigiously en
tertained with all of your work, es
pecially am I edified by your articles
on Foreign Missions. I have for a
number of years opposed foreign
missions on general principles, but
now since you have (to my mind)
so conclusively exposed the system as
persisted in by the missionary fa
natics, I have become rather an en
thusiastic opposer of foreign mis
sions.
But I soon find myself rambling
among the “Letters” written by con
tributors to the Jeffersonian. Some
of these letters have a clinch on my
attention just now. The whereof is
the vehemence with which some of
the brothers urge a conference of re
formers. Now, I believe a discussion
is timely, perhaps a conference is
also, provided the object be exclu
sively to organize the Populist party
(the only true reform party I know
of). Some of us old Pops still re
member a conference held some years
ago in which the Bryanites had part
(the biggest part). The result of
this conference was well nigh de
structive to the reform, or Populist,
party, and Mr. Watson was terribly
wounded in the same experiment.
Candidly, brothers, you ought to
be cautious. I will tell you that
nearly eighty years of experience has
taught me that it is best to “stick to
the bush,” don’t turn back. The
Populist principles were formulated
long ago by heroic men consecrated
to reform; and these devoted men
decided that Populist would be an
applicable name, so then I would
say, “stick to the bush.”
Some brother says, in one of the
letters I have been rambling among,
that people have become so preju
diced against the name Populist, that
he favors a change in name. Now,
brother, let us reason together: are
your prejudiced friends actually in
earnest; will they sure enough with
hold their help in the reform move
ment because of prejudice? Then
don’t tease t#em, they would be un
desirable members, and we could
manage them better out than in. I
have no aspiration whatever to dic
tate, but I do have an abiding faith
in ’the ultimate success of the Popu
list party, if it is not disrupted.
I do not remember at this moment
to have noticed anything Mr. Watson
has said on this momentous subject
of a conference. Perchance he is
watching the enemy. It is probable,
too, that he is lending his attention
to the sentiment of the rank and file
—the lay-members. After awhile it
may be Mr. Watson will have some
thing to say on the subject of a con
ference. Then it will be worth while
to be attentive. Should the confer
ence proposition prevail, allow me to
urge vigilance. But should those in
authority be so extravagant in their
zeal as to separate the name from
the principles, I believe the divorce
would be ruinous to the reforms
needed. It would be turning back,
and I would suggest to the authori
ties before doing so to observe an
old traditional custom make a cross
mark and “spit in it.”
I am, very truly, M. S. LEE.
Helena, Ala.
BY OUR VOTES WE MUST KEEP
THIS “THE LAND OF
THE FREE.’’
My Dear Sir: —I have with much
interest prayerfully and carefully read
from the Weekly Jeffersonian your
very satisfactory and charitable re
ply to the Rev. Scoville, and others,
who have so unjustly criticised and
misconstrued your position on the
great mission of the gospel of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I
have faith to believe the leaven you
have placed in the meal will result in
leavening the whole on the subject
of Foreign Missions.
On the Bth inst. I reached another
mile-post on the journey of life, the
number being three-score and ten. I
am proud of being a native Georgian
and of having been reared in our
God-blest land of America, which
our patriotic and self-sacrificing fore
fathers bequeathed to us as the land x
of the free, and the home of (;he
brave. “Let my right hand forget
her cunning, and my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth,” if I ever
falter in defending and aiding in try
ing to perpetuate the noble princi
ples of such a government. Let
every true reformer, be he Populist,
