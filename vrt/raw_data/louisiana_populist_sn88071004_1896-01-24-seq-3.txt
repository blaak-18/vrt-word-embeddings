BootIIh st Reslgn.
We have received since our con
vention half a score of letters from
leading Populists all over the State, e
begging us to get Mr. Booth to
come off the State ticket, in order4
that a winning ticket, or at least, E
one which will command the sup-,
port of our party, may be put in (
the field. We have received Mr.
Nelson's resignation from the tick
et, and unles Mr. Booth resigns,
we expect every other man on the n
ticket to resign. The Populist a
press oaf the State is listless in its t
support of the ticket, knowing the t
crcumstances under which it was
placed, or rather left in the field. a
Many of the papers, like the Pop- it
ulist, have refused to put the tick
et at their masthead, and will not
do oD iB its present shape. Itis
worse than folly to do so, -
As Hon. A. Beaoit says, wel

would be a calamity to our party, I

ish system of colnwcrci:al laws.
that no isc-rimnination aga:inst our
aur'icultural and industrial classes
may be made.
4. Wc favor a just and lileral
system of pulblic schools for the
lnefit of all classes of our lpeople,
and we deplore the fact that for
ninnyv years the management of
our pI)ulic school system has been
so defective that the party now in
power seeks to disfranchise a large
number of our citizens on the
grounds of ignorance.
5. We dlenoun'el the disgrace
ful and infamous election frauds
which have prevailll in Louisiana,
and we demand andl are deternlin
el to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall cast his bal
lot freely and secretly, and the
vote shall be fairly counted as they
are actually cast. This is the su
preme issue in this Campaign, andl
in its sucec- s the honor, manhool
and, prosperity of Louisiana are
involved. The foul and lIathsome
methols which have brought the
ballot box stuffer to the front, and
placed himu in lpower in L ,uisian.,
mu-,t, in the n:lune of liberty, jus
tice, morality and common decen
cy, be suppressed.
4;. We oppose and denounce the
pIroposed stffrageamendlment, con
cocted by political schemers, not to
purify and elevate the Iballot box
but to sublserve their seltish pIr
lMxses by irouvidling contradlictory
qualifications, to suddenly disf.ran
chise large masses of worthy ..:i
zens, by deluding the people with
promises of changes in the next
Legislature. We dlenounce the
whole amendment as a vicious
fraud which proposes measures and
methods that are un-American and
destructive of free institutions.
7. We favor the utmost econo
my of expenditures, in State, city
andi parish, and pledge our candi
dates to a strict and impartial en
forcement of all laws, and the pres
ervation and promotion of every
interest in Louisiana, whose wel
fare is broader and more sacred
than parti lines or partisan poli
cies; and we invite and urge the
true men and honest citizens of
Louisiana, without regard to past
party affiliations to join with us in
a noble, patriotic and powerful ef
fort to relieve our people and to
elevate the standard of politics
and public morality in our beloved
State,
E. J. Gamble, Chairman.
DERRY, LA., Jan. 12, 1896.
Editor Louisiana Populist:
Dear Sir: The Democratic pri
mary election held on 11th inst. at
Cloutierville, passed off quietly,
and will say by the help of the
populists who were over persuaded
by the ward heelers telling them
that it made no difference, that they
could vote in the prinmary and then
vote as they pleased in the general
election, and in so doing they were
enabled to poll 73 votes. But I
think when the general election
comes off they will be about one
third short, unless they work their
rabbit foot pretty lively. They
seemed to need only the vote of the
Populists to nominate a certain
man. Nominstions seemed to be
all they were after, and I suppose
they have some plan mapped out by
which they aim to elect their man.
If you see fit to publish this, you
are at liberty to do so.
W'. H. RUSSELL,
Ward 10.
Booth has a record on fusion
that we propose to ventilate if he
persists in his attempt to dehlver
our party to the Sugar-planters.
The Republican party is doing
about the same amount of crow
ing and boasting that the Demo
eratic party did in 189i, and it
will result about the same way.
The money power has both old
parties by the nap of the neck and
seat of their breeches and absolute
eontrols them. If you want
people represented in this gov
eament you have got to put a new
party in power.-Ex.
