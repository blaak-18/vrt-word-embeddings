LITTLE BOY BLUE.
Our Neighbor, he calls me his Little
Boy Blue
Whenever he goes by our yard;
And he says, “good morning,” or
“how do you do?”
But sometimes he winks awful
hard.
I guess he don’t know what my name
really is,
Or else he forgot, if he knew;
And my! You would think I am really
part his —
He calls me his Little Boy Blue!
Our Neighbor, he told me that Little
Boy Blue
Once stood all his toys in a row,
And said, “Now don’t go till I come
back for you”—
But that was a long time ago.
And one time, at Christmas, when I
had a tree,
He brought me a sled, all brand
new
And smiled when he said it was part
ly for me
And partly for Little Boy Blue.
Our Neighbor, he’s not going to have
any tree,
•So he says the best he can do
Is try to get something to partly give
me
And partly give Little Boy Blue.
Because, if he’s here, it would make
him so glad,
And he said he knew it was true
That ever and ever so many folks had
A boy just like Little Boy Blue.
Our Neighbor, he calls me his Little
Boy Blue,
And said he would like to help
trim
Our tree when it came —he would feel
that he knew
It was partly for me and for him.
He said he would fix it with lights
and wax flowers,
With popcorn and berries —you
see,
He’d like to come over and help to
trim ours —
He’s not going to have any tree!

A CHRISTMAS REMINISCENCE.
HE spirightly masculine

had subsided. They were
deep in devotion to my
Lady Nicotine, the rival
we all acknowledged and
none seriously disliked.
Such heavy monotones as
droned their way to our
ears had a reminiscent rhythm. We
knew that, in the easy, tolerant fash
ion men have, they were telling over
old yarns, which invariably begin
with a short chuckle of recollection, a
few staccato puffs of the pipe and a

if we spent our reunions in such
prosy recitals. I don’t know. Any
how, we were glad the dishes were
washed and the men-folk where they
should be —under easy domestic es
pionage, but not bothering us. The
-last boisterous boy had been capped,
mitten ed and sent for a romp out
doors and the little orphan nieces
were having their own season of bliss,
free from teasing and with new dolls
and unlimited sweets.
‘‘l’m glad it’s over!” This ex
clamation should have shocked us
with its apparent ungraciousness.
But it did not. Cousin Belle’s amaz
ing honesty is its own vindication.
She is frank, in an impersonal sort
of way that never stings as does the
honeyed candor of those who tell us
unpleasant truths “for our own
good.” And., besides, the remark

Christmas In “Ye Olden Time.”
found an echo in the heart of each
in the small circle, though we turned
in mild interrogation for her further
words.
They did not come promptly or
easily. “I don’t mean that any
thing—or anybody—is to blame. I’ve
enjoyed the giving—and the getting;
and your dinner, dear (turning to
me), was lovely. I am —perfectly
well —and I try —to be —happy. But
—on Christmas —you see —it all
comes back!”
Cousin Belle was nearer breaking
down than we had seen her since that
awful cablegram came from Manilla,
saying Harry would never return.
They were to have been married that
December. Had we forgotten the
girl’s sorrow? Not quite; only
Harry had been a little wild; he
came of a lawless stock. It had
seemed to us then for the best—and
we had, somehow, felt she would ul
timately come to feel that way, too.
But Christmas had brought things
back, as the shade over her pretty
face, like a blujr of mist on sunny
mountain slope, proved. A sympa
thetic silence fell. Jim’s wife slipped
her arm around the girl.
The action distinctly startled me.
Spontaneity in her was a shock.
Since Jim had brought her, an ex
pressionless, emotionless creature,
from “somewhere in the swmmps
of Florida,” as I had contemp
tuously termed it, I had not
liked her. She had been a good wife,
and the sturdy boys were unques
tionably like Jim and a credit to the
family. In the lackadaisical years,
there had been no bickerings. I think
I would have liked her better had
there been something to break the
monotony of her calm devotion. She
was so colorless, so drawling! There
fore, her caress inwardly affronted
me in that is said: “I understand.
I, too, have suffered.” No doubt she
had known the feeling I cherished
under all the reserve and perhaps my
inner resentment now was telepathi
cally conveyed to her, for on a sud
den she broke the queer spell of ret
rospect with • strange, hurried words
of hurt indignation.
“You all think I’m jugt a piece of
social driftwood that ought to be
grateful and obedient as a dog just
for being here —as Jim’s wife! Gawd
knows I’m proud of him and love
him; and I won’t say any of his
family has ever done me an inten
tional unkindness, but I think I’ve
paid for it, every day and hour, by
the way I’ve tried to do my duty by
him, and the boys and any of his
kith or kin that has a claim on him!
“I was the most heart-broken
young widow in the world when Jim
came —and tried so hard to make me
live —and forget! Jim knew what it
was crushed me to earth —and no
one else ever cared to find out! But
I want to say, now, that I never had
call to be ashamed of my first man.
This,” with a furtive, half-defiant,
half-entreating look, “was him!”
She held out a miniature, done on
ivory. I took it, almost dazed by her
volcanic outburst after the years of
complete reticence, and was aston
ished to behold a fase, almost too
delicately high-bred for a man’s, yet
so fearless and fine as to betray no
trace of weakness. I had never seen
so ideal a type. Understanding her
unspoken wish, I wonderingly passed
it to iSister May.
“I can’t tell what he was to me.
A Gawd, I reckon. I never seemed
to be anything but just created to
worship him, and be a mold for his
children. And that’s why I never
felt quite that I’d lost him, —so long
as the baby lived. She was his baby
—I never thought of her as being
mine, just the way I feel Jim’s boys
belong to me, too! It’s wicked, may
be, to feel so, but I love my boys
with a sort of flesh-and-blood love —
and little Louise—she was all spirit.
“And I never had a Christmas
with her —not one! She was just no
ticing things, and I knew she’d be
sure to like a tree. I wouldn’t be
lieve it when Ma told me she was
weaker—l went right on, showing
her all the pretties I’d got for her.
She didn’t appear to see anything,
though her eyes were wide open.
Only once —I held up an orange—
and I’m sure she smiled. Oh, Gawd!
You’ll never know how I prayed and
prayed that she drs see it and know
it was for her—and that she smiled!
It was the last thing I ever got to
do for her —
“Oh,” she moaned, and the grief
of it went through me like a keen
edged knife, “I suffered enough for
my boys—but I’d go through the
agony a thousand times for my girl
child—my little Louise!
“iSometimes I think it’s her spirit
with me has kept me so still all the
time. I want my peace, and my
chance to drearp of her growing up—
close by me —a little tot with her
dolls, and a school girl—and finally—
a daughter; sometimes she comes to
me in white, slim and tall, with her
father’s eyes and courage—and we
talk of him! There, I never should
have talked this way, but—but my
heart has allied so!”
“Oh, Alice,” cried Sister May,
“how can you ever forgive us? I’ve
never had anything but dream-chil
dren—but I do think I understand!
Dear heart,” she sobbed, “I have no
words to console you; only let me
love you!”
“While I may,” she added, softly,
then turned to me. “iSister mine,
it isn’t a Merry Christmas at all, but
it may be a blessed one of peace. You
were all so sweet to me with good
gifts, when I had not the tiniest thing
in return. Shall I tell you why?
Well, husband and I have seen the
great specialist—and, there isn’t
much hope with an operation, and
none at all without it. It will take
all the money we’ve saved for the
home we wanted to buy—and every
thing. No,” she said, quickly, an
swering my look of anguished in-
