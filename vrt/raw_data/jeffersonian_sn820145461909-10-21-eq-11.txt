PAY YOUR TAXES AND REGISTER
Pay your taxes and be doubly sure
that the tax-collector affords you an
opportunity to register. This is the
slogan throughout Georgia today.
Never before in the history of the
State have we had so exacting a reg
istration law as is the present one,
and never before was there the prob
ability of so many good citizens be
ing disfranchised as is the case now.
It is absolutely incumbent upon
every man of the voting age to pay
his taxes. This much is necessary
before he can register and qualify to
vote. And this mandate of the new
law is all well and good. A man
who will beat his taxes should not
be entitled to a voice in the public
government.
The erroneous impression has
gone out through certain publications
that a taxpayer is automatically reg
istered at the time his taxes are paid,
that the collector is required to place
the name of the taxpayer upon the
registration books upon receipt of
tax money.
The purpose of this is obvious. It
was simply and solely to mislead the
unsuspecting farmer who, perhaps, is
not so convenient to the tax-collector
and who might, to save time* send
his tax money by some one, thinking
it would be all the same in effect as
if he had gone himself.
The fact is, before you can be reg
istered and qualified to vote in next
year’s elections, it is required of you
that you shall come in person to the
tax-collector, pay all your taxes, sub
scribe to the oath which the collector
must administer at the time, and
then and there either sign or cause
to be signed your name in the book
for registration.
The tax-collector is required to
keep this book open six months from
October Ist; he is also required to
close it on the last day of March
next. Thus you have ample time in
which to qualify, and it will be your
own negligence if you don’t.
The Leader desires to impress
upon its readers the importance of
becoming thoroughly posted on this
matter. Register!—The Unadilla
Leader.
BABYLON.
The finding of Nebuchadnezzar’s
palace by German excavators of the
fortress of ancient Babylon doesn’t
seem to have received the attention
it deserves, the world here is so oc
cupied with present day discoveries
of another kind, but it is most inter
esting what the London Times re
ports of it all the same. Nebuchad
nezzar’s Babylon is buried many feet
beneath the ruins of subsequent do
minions, but inquisitive scientists are
digging merrily away to find the se
crets of a date yet more remote than
his from our own. In the course of
time and the pick modern man may
reach the source of all living things.
It is enough for the moment that the
great oblong hall with its alcove to
holl the throne and which is believed
to be the scene of Belshazzar’s feast,
fs laid bare, and the so-called "sacred
way” which took the priests of the
goddess Oshtar to the temple, is
now opened by the excavations.
Many relics have been discovered.
Magnitude of the king’s work is illus
trated by specimens of architecture
that thrill the dwellers of cement
houses. Fancy one of the outer walls
Ofct ‘Jeffersonian
being more than twenty-four yards
thick! In those ancient days time
was, indeed, made only for slaves,
and if they ever “struck” the con
tractors have left no records of the
event. It was a great city of brick
with splendid edifices whose remains
the dust of ages have kindly pre
served for us.
STOCK SENSE.
One hog-raiser says he fattens his
hogs on alfalfa and winter wheat
pasture, using cottonseed-meal as a
concentrated feed. He makes a slop
of the meal, allowing it to sour twen
ty-four hours. Begin feeding the
meal in small quantities and gradu
ally increase the amount.
A news item says that more horses
are stolen in New York City than in
Colorado, Montana and Texas com
bined. The greater majority of these
horses are never recovered and a con
viction for horse-stealing there is a
rare occurrence.
To do well and make money for the
grower, hogs must have good pasture.
Oats, rye and cowpeas are all good
for this purpose. Alfalfa makes one
of the best pastures, but in many lo
calities can not be successfully grown.
The hog will make from ten to
twelve pounds of meat, live weight,
for each bushel of corn eaten, the
sheep from five to eight and the steer
from four to five.
r~
Because hogs turn corn into meat
so readily too many farmers feed too
much corn and too little other feeds,
thereby making production cost more
than it should.
A great deal of the unsoundness in
horses is due to heredity. Only
sound, healthy stock should be used
as breeders.
One banker rates his customers ac
cording to their ability to raise and
market good hogs.
An experienced veterinarian says
to stop feeding for awhile is the best
remedy for scours in stock.
By using a rasp occasionally to
keep wear of the colt’s hoofs even,
diseases of the feet and legs may be
prevented.
An experienced breeder can tell a
good mother ewe at a glance.—Texas
Farmer.
VALUE OF SHADE.
Shade in summer is equal to shel
ter in the winter for the comfort of
live stock. If there are no shade trees
in the pasture, put up a temporary
shade of boards and poles. This
shade may be moved from time to
time and placed on poor spots to dis
tribute the manure.
It will leave you up in the air.
You won’t know whether it’s an un
canny bit of the supernatural, or an
uproarious joke. Out literary editor
says it’s both. Read Lollie Belle Wy
lie’s story in the November Magazine.
If you can’t spare a dollar, send a
quarter. We want your renewal.
