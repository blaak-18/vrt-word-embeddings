Our Legislators.
The People's party of Louisiana
may well Iw' proud of its represen
tation in the General Assembly.
r. The 17 Representatives and 2
r. Senators are all dignitied, earnest,
conservative men.
,, They have been true to their par
4' ty and their principles, yet they
have never refuscd to vote for
good measures, regardless of party.
By such a course they have won
the esteem and confidence of the
Snmajority of all factions and parties
' associated with them in the Legis
lature.
They have not pursued the
"smart-Aleck" course of firing in
a number of bills just to sec their
names in the journal, though seve
ral excellent measures have been
introduced and passed by them,
but they have sought rather to se
lect good measures from among
is the great number of bills of all
sorts introduced by the Democrats,
and support them, while they have
taken especial pains to kill a num
ber of pernicious measures.
Their caucus leader, Hon. C. L.
e Gunby, assisted by Messrs. James,
r Stewart, Bailey and Breithapt,
have done exceedingly well in the
House, and have the confidence of
their followers and the respect of
their opponents.
The Populists have had a respon
P sible part to play, because they
a have a majority of the Combine
caucus, the Republicans have con
ceded them the leadership, and
right well have they handled it.
The 4th District will be proud o
- its Populist representation when
the Record is made up. It con- I
sists of as good men and true, as
ever graced the halls of a legisla
ture, and is made up of A. W.
Stewart, of Grant, D. E. James
and Senator J. P. Patton of Winn,
f Dr. J. M. Brown of Natchitoches,
I J. E. Bullard of Sabine, and J.
W., Williams of Vernon.
The 5th District also hau an ex
cellent delegation, as follows :
A. T. Nelson and S. J. Mead
ows of Claiborne,,T. W. Pipes of
Lincoln, C. L. Gunby of Union, I.
D. Hogan of Jackson, and Henry
Breithapt of Catahoula.
The 6th follows with equally as
good, to-wit :
Senator M. R. Wilson, and Rep
resentatives Pat I)onahay, W. L.
Truman, and J. W. Bailey Jr.,
of St. Landry, J. W. Young of a
Arcadia, sand Josiah Klienpeter of 2
Ernst Baton Rouge; while the 3rd c
gives us only one, but equally as
good, in the person of R. P. Le- I
Blanc of Vermilihon. a
The Republicans have been equal- a
ly true and conservative. They t
have stood by us like brothers in a
every emergency, and their 10 rep- I
resentatives and 4 senators have al
ways been found in the thickest of e
the tight, baclking our Populist a
legislator&
Their caucus leaders Senator ,
Howell of the Senate and Repre- tl
senative O'Neile in the House, are e
able menr the soul of honor and b
the most earnest but careful work- l
era o
Toather the Populists and Re- g
publicans although placed at a
great disadvantage by the thievery a
of the Democrats, havre been able u
.by bonorable and straightforward I
methods to worry the Democrats b
no'little, and if the said Democrats ci
will eor continue their persecu.- el
tios md dishonest practes, this
combination is bound to win.

Enforce It Ntrictly.
ua The new election law which Fos
n- terism has foisted upon us is a fair
sample of what we may expect un
2 less pullic indignation makes it
t, unsafe for the administration hire
lings to conduct an election in a
r- manner suitable to the defacto of
y ticials.
jr This law was passed to exclude
y. the ignorant darkey, but what will
,n keep the henchmen from adding as
,e many names to the pall lists as
as they see fit, and thereby make ad
s- ministration voters, unless old hon
esty declare no, and files his pro
test with a Winchester.
We, according to this law are
n rid of the negro domination, and
ir there is no longer any excuse for
e" election swindling. If the white
'n men of this State sit down and al
low themselves to be swindled,
' they need never to expect any law
e- to protect them. The laws are all
1g right, the trouble is with the men
11 who make and execute them.
s, See that the law is carried out,
and check any violation thereof.
Show the vote thief that his mis
sion is endeld. Make him respect
your rights ami regard the ballot
box as sacred, and you will have
no more swindhing.
It takes politicians to make laws,
it takes men, and shot guns, sonic
ie times, to enforce them.
f Improvements.
Notice the change for the Isetter
1
in our paper this week, and go at
y once to helping us.
The Democrats were sure we
came here for the pap, and that we
would leave and our paper die if
we did not get it.
They measured our corn in their
n own half bushel and were correct
'- by that standard, but the rule
won't work.
If only one-half the Pops will
do for this paper only one-half of
8 what they can do, we'll bi right
'here in the year 1900, worrying
the life out of these pap-sucking
Democrats.
1How can you do it I
First, b" patronizing it with
your subscription and your "ad."
Second, by patronizing those
who advertise in this paper.
Why should you do this I
Y Because the paper is your friend
and is helping you,, and so is the
man who adlvertizes in it..
Police Jury.
The newly elected Pokew Jurors
f assembled at the Court-house last
f Monday and were sworn in, ex
I cept L. R. Burnside of ward 3.
a The old member fom ward 3,
- H. II. Oliver, was present and
seemed desiroua of holding over,
- and was urge I to do "so by some of
(the more recless characters who
i seem to be running affairs on the
other side.
- Wiser counsels prevailed howev
oer, and Mir. Oliver went home, a
t sadder but wiser man. Mr. BIrn
side was denied his seat for the
rwant of the forms of law. Al
though elected and so scknowledg
Sed by all, he had no c'nummissiodt
Sbecause of the plain violation of
law by the Supervisors and other
easpirator against the peace and
good name of this parish.
Mr. Geo. W. Kile of the 1st
ward, a liberal Democrat, was t
unanimously elected President.
The present incumbent, C. V. Por
ter, Chairman of the parish Demo
cratic executive committee, was
elected Treasunrr. .
By a division among the Demo
cratic mehboers in which President a
Kile through a spirit of fairness, J
cast the deciding vote with the 4 g
Populists, Mr. S. J. Honry, Chair- ,
man Populist pariah executive com- a

L8 Our Normal school.
This flourishing institution which
is one of most useful and meri
tous in our State, has gained an
e other victory over the prejudices
d and false notions of economy in
our State Legislature.
e Owing . to the lateness of the
I, coIllnlncculent exercis *s occasion
v ed by the small pox vacation, Pres
1 ident Boyd was unable to appear
SInbefore the house Appropriations
Committce in the interest of the
school. Although its necessities
- were fully set forth in the printed
t report, legislators seklom read the
many different pamphlets that are
piled upon their desks. So the
committee acted rather blindly,
and the deficiencies were onily cor
rected by3 the Senate ,before whose
comntnittee Presidcnt 1ly,3d was
able to nappear.
r But when the bill came back to
the House for c:,ncuirrece in the
Senate Amendments, those carping
economists who voted to increase
every political appropriation on the
list, even to the pay of Foster's
hallot-box-stuffini militia, began
r to howl against the increase of ap
propriations for the Normal and
the Ruston Industrial schools, two
of the very 'est educational fac
f tors in the State, anti the only ones
of a high order in reach of the
masses of our people. 4
Think of a self-respecting man
voting to decrease the pay of a
public schoot teacher and to raise
the por diem of the militia, which
has no earthy use save to bolster
up weak-kneed, ballot-box-stuters !
But those who had faced the mi
litia, who had been swindled out of
their rights and who had voted
against all useless and extravagant
appropriations came to the rescue,
the forces of education and prog
ress were rallied and the two great
schools of North Louisiana were
saved. Liberal appropriations were
given them and they will go on
hand in hand educating and eleva
ting North Louisiana and the State.
The "despised Combine" with its
30 votes ia the House, threw itself
nearly solld'in favor of those schools
-the Republicans at the request of
the Populists only-while leading t
Fosterites opposed bitterly-wheth- t
er at the dictation of Foster or not, E
is not known. i
It is believed however, that hlie (
wanted to economize at the expense ti
of these worthy institutions, so as a
to have larger surplus to invest in h
bonds at a premium though yet q
due.
Populistsla to I. Louis.

vention of the People's party, at il

should be at Alexandria some time
on Sunday night, so as to take the

The Texas Democracy is in the
tangle. The gold men have con- .
eluded to read the silver men out
of the party. In the face of the
fact that the Popnlist. can beat
both factions eombhned. It shows
that the golde men are bent mon rule
or rain. That's just the way they
would run this country if permit- ra
tea to. Remember the saying "a -
house divided against itsel" cannot
stand." Ul

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City,_ to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations - with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Shoe.u Read It.
It contains 176 pages of laugh- 1
provoking matter, anl 40 full-paie
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
