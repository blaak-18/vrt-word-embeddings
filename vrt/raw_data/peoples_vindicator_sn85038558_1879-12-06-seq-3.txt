"T'fe Tele" for November.
Voice enlture is gradually hwing re
cognized not alone as an accomplishment,
hut as necesary for the preservation and
restoration ,o health. Proper eare of the
voice neeessitates proper care of some of
the ment vital parts of the organism.
A peeseb-defeet is no diseane i itsnlf,
bet Is thb result of abnormal condition,
egagale or functional, of a part or parts

sad only journal devoted chiefly to the
Interets of stutterers and stammerers'
aelie giving all systems known for
their relief, It treats of vocal culture Into
all Its phases, and is of valne to every,
perna laterested la the speaking or single
voce. The amain contents for November
are: ''The Care of Stuttering" (ale.

SCENES AND INCIDENTS. (
The opening of the election was mark
ed with a calmness in striking contrast
with that of Radical elections. A large
crowd was in attendance at the polls
during the entire day and not a harsh
word was heard or a drunken nman seen
anywhere within the entire parish. Not
withstanding the beautiful day a light
vote was polled, which, with the inci- I
dents throughout the parish, are sum
moned by the vigilant reporter of this A
paper.
Now that the election is over and the r
disappointed ones have had time to digest
their defeat, we think it is a good time
to suggest to all our citizens the necessity
of burying the little animosities that e
hate been engendered by the recent d
heated lotal canvass, and all go in to
gether under our new constitution and 1
help build the wasted resources in our J
pariah. Every man of good judgment
will miakeall due allowance for the dif
ferencesofopinions so peculiarly char. j
acteriatic of all disputed local elections,
and will snbmit tothe arbitrament of an I
expressionl of the will of the people, C
made in a manner acknowledged by all
to have been open, fair and honest, e
From what we have heard, there has I
not been the slightest imputation upon
the integrity of the commissioners, ap
pointed throughout the parish, to eon
duct the election, and the decision of the
people has been made without t
FRAUD O0 INTIMIDATION,
In fact, without anything to prevent a.
fair expression of the people. There
were differences of opinions, but we have
no hesitation in saying that the opinion
of those opposed to our own were bon
eatly entertaincd, and we are asisted
that those whose goodopinione are worth
striving for, will give as credit for equal
integrity. Now friends, on the opposite
side, bury your little aulnosities in the
verdiet shat has been pronounced by the
people.

How sweet and lovely were our
Too sweet, alas! to last;
For they have met their several
And palned into the past.
We thought we might depend aupo
The ward of certain wards,
But soon our hopes are lost and Ione,
And gates blstrucnt our gaits.
But little does the public care
About our woes and whose ;
It smells the s!aughter in the air,
And thinks it knows its nose,
Sad is the hoomer's lot when sets
Some favorite sonny's sun,
And sad are they whose doubtful Wards,
Can show no wonders won.
But we most strive to bear our pain,
The blow that stope our blow ;
Our lost may be the people'sgain,
And oh! how much they owe!
Yet it is sad, beneath the feet
A gloomy sea to see,
And never more, in meadows sweet
A busy bee to be.
