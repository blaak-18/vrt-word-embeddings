ISpeclal New York Letter.l
The strike is not a modern invention.
It has existod in some shape or other
e initio, and it will continue to exist
until the end of all things, for it is
caused by poverty; and we have the
very highest authority for the belief
that the ppot will always be with us.
Leaving out the case of Abel, the.
first strike on record is that of Jacob
agaiist his employer And father-hi-law
l.ban, who was the owner of a stock
ranch in the early days. Jacob's griev
ance is briefly, but succinctly, set forth
in the. forty-first vqrse of the thirty
second chapter of Genesis. It reads:
e a oe
TIIE IRIOTERS 8EE TIIUE POINT.
"Thus have I been for twenty years in
thy house; I served thee foul teen
years for thy two daughters, and six
years for thy cattle; and thou hast
changed my wages ten ties" -
Tnen Jacob struck his duplex father
i :n-a.. f, ":' ter ._ :. nd, not get
tiit'themn. w 'nit. Th-i wasone of
ti,: 'io strike:: t:.it was n success, for
Jacob '.rentt i:o bIunsihe" on his own
acxsuint. ar7 prospcrcedi. It will be
pOti:' cd, ho'. ever, thlt h!a it not been.
fo" a bad dream that Laban had he
would have brought Aeob to terms. In
this, the first of all recorded strikes,
the Almighty sided with the oppressed.
t Another io~bl e,strike was that of
the Isra'ii teolai jst the exactions of
Pharoah, he of the indurat&I heart.
Moses ~cas the organizer of this strike.
WVhen Pharoah called out his militia,
to bring the strikers to terms, they
came to grief -p n miraculras manner
in the Red sea. However,- itiis only
fair to call attention to the fact that
Pharaoh's version of the trouble has
never beein published. There may have
been some mitigating circumstances, for
the subsequent conduct of the children
of Israel, in putting to the sword those
with whom they did not agree, justi
fies the suspicion that they, themselves,
were not entirely devoid of discrep
ancies. Ineidenttally, it may be also
mentioned that before leaving Egypt
Moses struck an Egyptian so hard that
he never rallied from the effect of the
blow. -
I never see. that Egyptian obelisk in
Central park%thout thinkingiabout the
row between 3Moses and Pharoah, for it
was one of the obelisks in front of the
temple of On, at- which institution
Mosese was a student. Ther it was
that he acquired much of that wisdom
for which: he was justly celebrated.
Strange, isn't it, that there should be
in New York an obelisk at which the
great law-giver must have gazed every
dayQ But/I am digressing.
A strike very much- to be commend
ed was that of the ancient Greeks, who,
following the advice of their leader,
Mlarco Bozzaris, strueic or their altars
and their fires.
Strikes are very uncertain as to the
ultimate result. They are like .run
away horses-more easily prevented
than stopped. And, like runaway
horses, those engaged in them de not.
realize when they start out that they
themselves may be fished out of- the
wreck at the finish.
It even happens that the capitalists
utilize strikes for their own benefit. It
sometimes occurs that a manufacturer,
who holds more stock than he can
carry, makes fortune out of misfortune
by inducing the employes to go out on
a strike. Labor frequently accommo
dates capital with the loan of a strike.
" Strikes generally affect the strikers
more disastrously than the employers.
1Men have stomachs, dollars have not.
-Again.t·Is estimated that the amount
site~t5.whborkingmen in strikes during
'thWst twoyesia ou have paid the
wagfof'h hundredtlt  ad men dur
IngathatieesJ-" -..k ". "
One of the great clt :to the
success of strikes ei. is to-be
found in thp .  ad'a
strike has bien. itift ie
striers arcawe a sj
from the very to gete -
clety, meanwho- ever do t o
ander any oinstances whatevy It
was to umnan of this typo that a svoft
puiqded ~friend of mine in Brooklyn gave
.Jp order mor' a dinner. The bill came in
Mr nine beers and a cigar. The strik
erain Brooklyn were lso reinforced by
foreign anarchists, men. who esme to
this country in search offreedot---from
work. Is the fnutuje.adumi the pitt, this
objectionable ele.ent will exert an in
fluence for evil ~i IvAr'"-. strike that
takes plac. in.a.largt city Muich more
tronblis la c;eanised by men who can get
work, lint won't work, than by those
who want to work. Of course,oemploy
ers, particularly when they are large
corporations, are always violently op
posed to labor demonstrations of any
kind. In fact, the baseball player is the
only one whose right to strike is not
only acknowledged- but approved by
those for whom he works.
The only persons who seem to profit
•b1 hto and stnikee ses the eWboy'
wh-se1I ae. They aroused curiosi
ty atI ours during the Brooklyn
riots by s;houting: "Eire's yer extry.
.Sploshun,.and death! Great excite
menti" It- is not unlikely that more
popio diedfrom pneumonia cotatracted
by going out lito the' streets at night,
thinly clad, to secure the latest ;sows,
than were actually killed in the steet
fights. -
There are, moreover, strikers who are
not anytoo fondof steady work. There
is a well authenticated ease of a IDrooic
lyn 'striker saying to his wife: "More
labor troubles; when- will ,the poor
laboring man in this land have -peace
and lhis honest. rghts?" "What's the
matter now?" asked his wife, "nothing
worse, I hope." -"Yes, indeed, there is;
I heard a rumor that the-trolley bosses
were going to give in and then I'd have
to go to work again."
No -public 'speaker; no matter hos
demonstrative his audience or unpop
ular his theme, ever- went.- through
the ordeal to whiclhthe new motormen
on the Brooklyn tiolley, ar, and his
guardian angel, .- policeman with a
large club with warts on it, are still
subjected, occasionally, although the
strike is supposed to' be over. While
the strike was' at its height rows and
fights were 'of such- eommon occur
rence that if at any time there-was no
rioting going on large crowds gathered
from curiosity- to see what was the
matter. "However, the new employes
became so accustomed to harsh treat
ment that they were grateful when no
more dangerous missiles than eggs of
last year's vintage, back-number cats
and like-' aromatic testimonials were
wafted at them.- Numerous motermen
and policemen underwent the experi
ence-of .that orator, at the meeting.on
the St. "Stanislaus, poetically described
by Bret Harte. lIe -was hit by a large
-geological-specimen, and then
" He curled up on the floor,
And the subsequent proceedings interested
him no more."
The strikers and many other citizens
of Brooklyn entertained a feeling of
contempt for the militia until they
demonstrated their 'effectiveness. A'
private 'of the Seventy-first regiment,
who was returning to- NewYor pn a
few hours' leave of absence, was stana
ing on the platfornm qfran eldvated sta
tion, when! he was` approached by an
aged Hibernian, who hadoverestimated
himself. The latter expressed his can
did opinion that with "an ould black.
thorn" he could make short work of a
militiaman with his gun and bayonet. '
S"tVWhere wvould you hit me?" asked the
soldier,.good naturedly.
"On the top. av yer cocoanut, be dad!'
' WYell, stand back and I'll show you
what'I'dcdo," replied the soldier, mak
ing the head parry and lunging for
sward wijh his bayonet. "That's what
I'd do, and you and your old blackthorn
would be buried in the same coffin."
"Did y z iver see the loike?" ejac.
lated the Irishman, satisfied that a tuns.
ket and bayonet are not to be trifled
with when in the hands.of a man wvhc
knows what to do-with,them.
The gret .gudstioi4 of the da5f is:
"What shall l !` Etodiprevent strikes?'
They are going to; occur in the future
as they ave.. lb th past, involving un

property. It is impracticable for vari.
.ous reasons. They propose to have n
general division of property. That
might do for a short time, but it v rduld
not be very long before those who were
not addicted to stale beer and a seden.
tary life would acquire the property of
the others. That would involve another
"divide," and would ultimately become
gnonotonous, -and create -bad feeling.
There is another serious objection to
the general division plan. According
to the socialistic theory all property is
robbery, hence, as the receiver is worse
than the thief, any socialist who takes
any of the property is a receiver of
stolen goods. It would not be right to
thus place temptation in the path ol
the socialist. Hie might forget to sa :
"Get thee Uehind me, Satan."
Another remedy is to return to the
doctrine of the primitive Christian
church. Let all men be converted.
Then they will place all their money
and property in-.a common fundland
each one can take out according to his
needs. This, of course, involved the

structur. of the soil, and a well dug.
dow~'thiough it. It can be seen at a
glance that liquids soaking down upon
the left-hand side and striking a layer
of clay or other more or less impervi
ous soil, will be conveyed directly into
the well.
When it happens that nothing filthy
exists .lion the surface on the side

the water remrains pure, but whben the

which has perhaps been, dug purposely..
in a depression, with- the ildes of. a
greater likelihood' of there finding
water. Any filth-'on two sides of a
well may thus be conveyed into it.
Moreover, in the case of soil that is
homogeneous .in charactir there is a
natural drainage toward a well, as is
indiehted in Fig. 3. ,;
L;and drainage is toward both wells
and drains. Tile drains laid lhree rods

between t' drann has its siurface
water cons _yed away mostly by, seep
age. lut-all throui the land adjacent
to a tile drain the ~a~ter also makes a
few little channel., or itself toward'the
tile. - Is is known-that such little chan
nels are made from points as far away
as twenty-five feet from a four-foot
drain. It may be taken for granted,
then, that a well drains naturally a
very large areaabout it, and .the im
portance of allowing nothing of a filthy
nature to exist within that area ought
to be apparent. It sometimes happens
that a well is contaminated by matter
brought .from a considerable disiftnce
by surface water in time of a spring
freshet or a heavy rain at other sea
sons. To obviate this the ground about
a well should have a height of some
two feet, a mound like arrangement
.around the well curb, as shown in Fig.
4. A well may also be contaminated by
earth worms, rats, mice or toads. It is
wise, therefore, to lay the upper por
tion of the wall in cement and bring
the wall up tight under the platform.

SELECTING LAYERS.
The Experence of a I'"oltrynan Who ai
Kept Hie Eyes Open.
It is true that there is no infallible
rule for selecting the best layers in a
flock of hens; .but there are a few indi
cations that show which liens are prob
ably the best layers. - I say probably,
for the rule does not always work, and
exceptions to it are not rare.
It will be understood by this that I
only give these rules from observation
among my own flocks, aid -from my
own experience.
The most active liens in ia flock are
.usually the best layers. The hen who
stands ready to_run out of the htstse in
the morning as soon as the door opens
and flies" at the feed as if she were
starving, is the one that will produce
the most-eggs, commonly. Such a hen
will not stund around in the sun after
eating her morning feed, but will be
seen far away from the house foraging
for food. She is the hen that sings as
she goes about, and is the one who
will find hter way into the garden if
she can possibly get there.
A large comb is' a--sign of a good
laver. iiy this I mean a large comb for
the breed she belongs to. Almost i
variably the Leghorn hlien that has a
large thin comb that drops down over
one eye will be found to be a good
layer. The comb of a good layer is of
bright red all the 'time she is laying,
and as soon as it becomes pale, or dark
eolored,.you may be sure she has
ceased to lay.
The good laver is rather narrow
across the. shoulder and wide in the
ramp, with the rear of her body deep
and low. Her feathers are glossy ishd
her eye bright, and she is full of life
and action. If. a hen possesses all
these indicationS, there is not much
danger in picking her for a breeder,
as sihe will alinost always be prolific
and epgs produced by her will be fer
tile. and the chicks strong and vigorous.

Tlhe practice of feeding wheat to
horses has grown rapidly, but there is
considerable dispute as to the best
method of using the grain, so that the
following instructions from Armour &
Co. will be read with interest: Ground
wheat-abould be fed dry, the same as
oats. - Mix halt'ground wheat with
half whole-oats (care should be taken
to weigh "ffnd not measure this, as
wheat is heavier than oats). Three and
one-half pounds to three and three
fourths pounds mixture ground wheat
and oats to a feed is a fair feed for
draught horses; five pounds would be a
.full feed, and equal to seven or eight
quarts of oats. Two and one-half
pounds to two and three-fourths pounds
to a feed is a fair feed for light draught
horses or driving horses;' four pounds
would be a full feed. In feedin-g wheat
and oats mnixed, it would be well to feed
bran mash twice a weglc.
