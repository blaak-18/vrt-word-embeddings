Of Peaçhçs and Pears and per
haps Apples, we have not room to
eay mon», than that they can be
raised in the utmost profusion. We
must dismiss vegetables amUptrden
froils ; with the same generality.
We like to have forgotten sweet
potatoes, the most prolific of all
crops, Five hundred brothels have
been raised to the acre, and we
know no reason why it cannot be
«tone again.
HOUSES AND MITLF.S.
Those raised here are worth 25
per cent mora than the same stock
raised in Kentucky. This Parish
was the native home of the celebra
ted Baocilorse texington.
CATTLE.
We bave seen none of pure blood,
but the half bloods gives the great
est promise, that improvement
could bo carried to the highest do
gree.
BHEEP.
The indications are that there is
» country better adapted to such
weds as the Cotswold Southdown
Geeister and a cross between either
of them and the merino Sheep/here
ate almost entirely free from fiisense
and are exceedingly Prolific. To
all these natural advantages we are
where thonsanda of Texas beeves
come annually for shipment, and
where Texas Oxen might be bought,
at thirty or forty dollars a yoke.
Sue}) is the table of agricultural
logarithms from which we propose
to work out our problem of what a
farm in the Valley of Red River
may be aiul ought to be.
We will take a farm of 75 acres
of open hind« and 50 acres of wood
land. This we would fence in with
a hedge of Red Locust, and in three
years have it high enough and
strong enough to keep out sheep
killing dogs, and sheep stealing,
hog stealing and cattle stealing
marauders. *
This farm we would divide and
plant as follows: Ten acrea in
corii, 10 in oats, 10 in rice, five in
cottou, Ave in cane, 10 in meadow,
2 in sweet potatoes, 8 for orchards,
gardens, lots &c., aud 15 in pas*
tnres.
We have already in a previous
article detailed the manner in which,
we would prepare this land for
corn, cotton, cane, and perhaps
iice, but it may be well to say
something about how we would get
the fertilizers with which we would
enrich this land. We have men
tioned the green crop whylh we
would make with the pea vine.
Tlie ballance we would manufacture
from the barn yard, muck land
plister and cotton seed, as longeas
we eonld find people foolish
enough to sell them atf ix or even
at 10 dollars per ton. For canejwe
we would go to some planter wiio
was burning his baggass and jget
enough to enrich our, land to ànv
desired fertility. Of course for oats
the turning under the green drop
and snbsoiling, fertilizing aud plow
ing would have to be done in t$mc
for planting by the middle of Oc
tober. t f
For our seed we would procure
the best and especially coi ton from
a latitude two degijees north of j ns
to secure an early crop. For the
purpose Of stimulating the qf?ck
vegetation ot our seed, we would
purchase enough guano and Super
Tlioso pliâtes to roll the cotton Seed
in, and soak the seed for corn, outs,
rice &c. There is one other fertil
izer within reach lof h and reds of
farms in this Parish and richer
than ar.y we havej named ; wajEer !
The imagination cSn hardly picture
the fertility of a nïeadow, whieiji iaf
ter being dressed ^eavily with barn
yard manure, and subsoUed, could
lie* irrigated at wilj. How by flow
ing; their green lijfe could be pro
tected against tbb early frost of
winter and the lat^ frost of Äprsng.
The only obstacle to our promue
ing crops of Irish potatoes, cabba
ges, celery, carrot^, turnips, le|iuce
aud beets in the Fall is tin want of
water, at)d with liicgation we cLuld
make them in the .same abundance
as iu the Spring asd Summer.
y, .- -v
To »U im mat be added the se
curity of stands of èotton in Spring
and an immunity from drouths in
with a 10 borse power cngine'wlîich
iroidd gii; tbe coUon, grind-., tlie
caiie and meal, aud thrash out the
sutall gral». j
IJ|K>n such a farm we would raise
1000 bushels of cow, 500 bushels
of oats, Ö00 Ijiishels oftfee, lS lmlek
ot ootton, Î& bogMltends of sugar,
2 (f barrels of molasses, 1000 bushels
ot sweet potatoes, 40 tons ot pea
vine lia^v 40 tons ot Bermuda hay,
500 bushels of peas îroia the cor,u
land and vegetables end fruits in
abundance, and we. forgot to men
tion lOO bee bives, from which we
would get 6000 pounds of hodt»y.
This estiipdte is Utopian hi, com
parisou with what is now done on
four times as many acres ; but it is
even bëlow our lowest figures,
In none of them was imitation used
except, that Of the 200 bushels of
corn per acre
The manuel labor requisite for
the plowing, plantiug, and cultiva
tion of this crap would be two good
tfands, as nine-tenths of it would
be done with the gang plcAv add
cultivator, and a seeder. The
teams fequtsite would be one; pail
of mules or horses, aud two yoke of
good oxen. Another good baud
and two yoke of oxen would be re
w :■ v, ■ f ■ ■ ■
quired for hauling panure, wood,
&c., and cultivating tbe garden fend
orchards. f 1
For gathering the crop, or as it
is ter.ned iu other countries bar
vesting« we would depend entirely
upon extta laboi, and for which we
would be'able to^pay price enongli
to be sure to get it, and as much as
we wanted.
But our farm is stilt incomplete,
4 good milch cows, 25 pure blooded
cotswold sheep, 4 blooded stock
hogs, 50 head of poultry; improved
breed, 50 head of gee3e^ a spinning
jenny, a band powerjoom,and over
tbe front gate the mol to, to buy
nothing that can be made bt home;
The spinniag jenny and hand pow
er loom, ought to be in every fami
ly the companion of the, Sewing
Machine, whicfti in its sphere has
made labor a pleasure instead of a
drudge. Two yards per hour of
jeans and three of domestic could
be woven on tlie hand power loom,
and we presume the spiuning jenny
can perform its portion of the labor
in the same time. It should be tlie
pride of every farmer while ou his
farm to bo clad in his own home
spun.
Such is an outline of what a farm
in the Valley of Red Hiver may be;
and ought to l>e.| We will not this
time say any thing of the charm
which literature and science can
throw around such a li e, nor of the
numberless beauties which may be
clustered arôund such a home. Its
vineyard, its apiary, its orchards of
rare liuits; its Eugiish Walnuts,
its Japan plums, its pommegrati
ates, its chesnuts, its golden peach
es. its ruddy apples, its sweet flow
ers ot infinite beauty, its« jajonicas
its roses, its oleanders, its green
pastures and their happy herds, its
soi't meadows, its lawu of deep
shade, its waveing crops, and its
golden harvest. Of course all this
caunotbe accomplished âtouce nor
in one year, but it may be in five.
Nor need the philosophy and learn
ing.which accomplishes it be learn
ed at schools. The farm itself is a
schoolhouse which can, furnish its
owu learning aud philosophy and
though they may be rude and un
poHsbed, like the rustic homespun
of the farm, yet it has a strengiu
aud wurmth and comfort and in
trinsic worth which fits it admira
bly for the practicable purposes or
the farm aud the rough usage of
life.

Durham from the wild stock of. fhe

adapted itsejf to the stern neçessi^

Whether the $hOrthorn or , the wijd
stock possess the greater vitality may
be questioned ; bat if we reason from
analogy, by considering in eh. ' Wé
may conclude that tlie Shorthorn has
become what he is by reasoa ofthia
superior vitality; for the civilised
mau is capable of greater endurance
than the savage, hence it is to bo,
given as role that only upon su*
perior vitjlity can superior qualities
be built. Tu e improving of virion«
kinds of stock must not be considered
us a completed work either in cattle
abeep, hogs or horses. The intelli
gent American farmer is to con.
tinue the work so successfully
brought forward by the English, f*"
mer ; and is to be borne in mind
that the more thought aud • learning
that, can be brought to (be assistancc
of labor in improving stock, the
greater and möno rapid will bä Iht
success. But it i« useless in tbr
present state of our farming to un
dertake to improve stock in any pari
of Our country that is deficient in
abundant natural grasses. There
are sections of tbe United Stater
where the Siiorthorn inevitably
shrinks, aud were in a feW gedera
t'ons he will retrograde to some
thing like the Texas steer, • because
races derive their characteristic»'

abundant food labor and skill art
