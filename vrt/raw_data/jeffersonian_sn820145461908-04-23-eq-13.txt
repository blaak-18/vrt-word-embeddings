Sleep
Sleep is nature’s re
building period, when the
energy used by the brain,
muscles and organs is re
newed. If you lose sleep,
your system is robbed of
the strength sleep should
give. Continued loss of
sleep multiplies this loss
until you become a phys
ical wreck. Dr. Miles’
Nervine quiets the irri
tated nerves and brings
refreshing, invigorating
sleep. Nervine contains
no opiates, and therefor
leaves no bad after-effects.
“For over two years I suffered un
told agonies; my friends thought I
was going crazy. I could not sleep
nor rest at all. I tried different doc
tors, but failed to find relief. My
head would ache all the time; I was
like one drunk; could not concentrate
my mind, and was 'so restless and
worried that sleep was out of the
question. After taking one bottle of
Dr. Miles’ Nervine I felt -wonderfully
changed. lam now on my third bot
tle and am gaining all the time. I
can lie down and sleep like a child,
and am able to do my work.”
MRS. MAY SCOTT, English, Ind.
Your druggist sells Dr. Miles’ Nerv
ine, and we authorize him to return
price of first bottle (only) if it fails
to benefit you.
