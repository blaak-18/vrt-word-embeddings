We note that Judge Fred Gates, oc
of New Iberia, is a candidate for pr
the Legislature. The judge may
well be called the "exterminator of na
negroism in the 19th judicial dis- ml
trict." It is he, first cf all, who
saved that district from the incom
petent rule of Radicalism. He is a
man of nerve as well as ability, as dP
is shown by his career on the bench Ph

ET. would wish it to be. Ve have been v
told several times that hereafter the t
Republican party in Louisiana would ti
be a political body composed of c
white men only and that the nigger fi
would not be admitted ih it. In tb
this parish, a number of men joined n
the old-timers and effected an or- u
ganisation. Some of- them were tl
doubtless actuated by honest mo- n
tives, while others, it must be ad- a
mitted, are after federal pap, in the sj
event a Republican it elected presi
dent next November. Some people
were good enough to believe that
the new infusion of respectability in
the Republican party would purify
it of its objectionable odor; but you
might as well try to make a limpid
e; stream of the Red river by throwing I
in it a few drops of artesian water
as to attempt to -whiten the Repub
lican party with the accession to its to
ranks of a few white omen. One is th
as much a physical impossibility as
the other. gr
Most of our readers must have by
heard of the Republican State thi
convention held in New Orleans
the other day. It was called
to order by Tom Cage, a nigger for
from Terrebonne, and presided over co:
by Bob Guichard of the same race. Nc
The secretary was a nigger also. In wh
fact all the prominent members of On
that convention were negroes. The m
parish of Lafayette was represented col
cey; in that distinguished body of dis- ity
Con- tinguished men by the Honorable gra
STelismare Paddio, and we believe Ha
Lur; the Honorable Joe Porter was Pat
pra
rt; a conspicuous figure of that hot
a J. brilliant gathering of dusky yot
statesmen. That mob-it was wit'
her- nothing but a mob-nominated or and

that Memphis Commercial-Appesal. h
ity in The New York Mail and Express
mriy gets very red in the face over a
tyou Southern outrage that recently oc- B
id cured m Hartford, Conn. It seems
,win that Prof. Frissell, of the Hampton O
water Institute, was on a lecture tour in p
pub- New England and had with him five
to its negro youths, graduates of the insti
n is tute. All the hotel proprietors in L
the city refused to admit the ne- U
groes, and they had to be cared for
have by private citizens, probably of T
their own race. Commenting on B
this truly damnable outrage the
iled Mail and Express says: T

The hotel proprietors, are not to pi
ap- blame, however. They said that
with them it was purely a matter of

allow it. So strong was the public
'm- prejudice against the negro that it spC
nt, would destroy the patronage of any spe

the The Mail and Express therefore is as I

we what is the use in kicking up a fuss ta

f his Feb. z6 a very small nnumber of c
to be people were present, and those there tl
erred were mostly minors. Among a num- a
hu- ber of others whose names I cannot v,

Theall. That these leading citi- tio
zfive zns and Democrats should be class
ton ed with minors is a surprise to us.
ate, Please tell us, Mr. Googoo, if any c
sell of these gentlemen are minors?
a That they have all passed t
o- the age of majority there is no bit
rer- question. The fact that "Googoo"
ne- Las called them minors can be ac- fa
tes. counted for in this way only: as they me
aP- will not follow him and the other
ign googoos in the Republican-Populist Reve
ese combine in the opinion of ".oo- the
em goo" they have not sufficient' under- del
ig- standing to be ranked among men. got
S"Googoo" says also that the
alt. speakers spoke from the gallery of at I
ant a saloon, intending by that state
th, ment to injure the candidacy of tut
ent the Democratic nominees. In jus
er- tice to Mr. Philojene Landry, the cha
proprietor of the saloon, we will sa)y anu
a that it was closed, it being on a Sun- will
of day. Be assured, dear "Googoo" fort
that the gentlemen who constitute Sou
ot the Democratic ticket and who will
li spoke on that day could afford to date
speak on top of a barrel full of of
ts whiskey and not touch a drop of it, dele
as not one of them indulge in strong the
is rinks. I will admit, however, Mr. Yor
ne "Googoo" that it is not wise for all iana
candidates to be around barrels of a
s beer and whiskey, as they might urge
s take some of the intoxicants by the prol
process of absorption. -C
The gentlemen composing the
ie "People's Ticket" had a meeting at
Royville on Sunday last. Their
is speeches were directed principally
against the suffrage amendment,
and elicited no interest as every
body he ie is opposed to the
is amendment; it is a dead issue.
The orators took the pains to say
re that Mr. Julian Mouton, our repre
sentazive, had voted to submit the
amendment to the people, which
SMr. Mouton had slated to the peo
e ple here Sunday before last. With
L the exception of a few chronic kick
ers Mr. Mouton is approved by the
voters of this section of the parish
- for having voted to submit the
s amendment to the people, and the
e people are all grateful to him for
d having killed the Benoit bill which
t was calculated to disfranchise a
-very large number of our voters.
-Mr. Mouton, who has always been
-popular in this ward, is increasing
- in popularity every day since his
r position on the suffrage.is known,
b and with the other Democratic nom- If
p inees he will have a large majority.
i If a vote had been taken at the
,meeting held here Sunday by the
- "People's Ticket" folks, a repeti
e tion of the celebrated silver meeting
I which took place at the court-house
Slast July, would have occurred. The
Democrats could have captured the
t meeting and introduced the speak
a ers just as they did with Judge De
I baillon and Mr. Wmin. Campbell.
A good crowd was present, but the1
" People's Ticket" was not in it.
No applause greeted the speakers.
During the last of his speech
Judge Debaillon was asked by some
one in the crowd at three different I
times in a voice distinctly heard all
over the hall: "'How will you vote
for governor?" and every time he
Sviible that:*he gen leman, was:U eip
barrassed and did not knowr what to
do. He paused every time he was
questioned, but no answer wouid he
its give. After the speaking the crowd
gathered and most all present could !
not understand how the head of the
"People's Ticket" did not know or
would not say how he would vote
r Will for governor. An old Democrat
ºle drew the attention of the crowd by
saying that he could not see
how Judge Debaillon could come
here to advise them how to vote
when the judge himself did not
of the know how he was voting for gover
ieting nor.
le on Mr. Editor, how, in the name of
her of common sense, can it be expected
there that the people of this ward, who
num- are Democratic to the core, will
annot vote for the "'People's Ticket" when
lemen the head of that ticket will not say
close in public that he wall support Mur
the phy J. Foster, the Democratic
Jean nominee, for governor ?
Ser- Now, Mr. "Googoo," you, who
ahan, may have been allowed to enter into
linals, the secret and sacred circle of the I
Tra- "comite anti-administratif" which
Lan- was organized at Falk's hall last
irmen September, please be so kind as to

relson called "People's Ticket" support for

The mighty wrestling with the
o us. colored delegates that has been go
any ing on in Louisiana adds little lus
lors? ter to the fame of either of the con- C
no testants. It is a disgusting exhibi- 3q
bition of the most open, brazen and
flagrant corruption. The respective
merits of the two candidates cut no
they figure whatever in this contest, for
ist every advantage gained either by
loo- Reed or by McKinley is paid for on
der- the spot with cold cash. Every
delegate obtained by either will be
then got by downright bribery and by
the frauds committed by hired officers
a of at the primaries. The negroes who -
ate cut little or no figure in legal elec
jus- tions are mighty in a tussle of this
the character and they stand out with
much firmness for the longest price.

gun- will be an old and oft-told tale be
:oo" fore the campaign is over. In every
tute Southern State the same methods
who will be resorted to and the candi
i to date best provided with the means
of debauchery and with friends
most expert in its use will win the
it, delegates. It is to be noted that
ong the friends of Gov. Morton, of New
Mr. York, are moving among the Louis
a/iana delegates. They doubtless
have their pockets full of persuasive
of arguments, but whether they will
ght urge them now or wait for a more
the propitious time remains to be seen.
