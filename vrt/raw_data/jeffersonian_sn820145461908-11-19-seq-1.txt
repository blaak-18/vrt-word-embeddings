The tenth Annual Btate Confer
ence of the D. A. R. has just been
held at Covington, Ga.
Rev. Schofield Battersby, rector of
Holy Trinity Church at Blackley,
England, has addressed an open let
ter to the Bishop of Manchester that
is stirring the leaders of English
thought. He prophesies impending
revolution if measures are not taken
properly to care for England’s un
employed horde of starving people.
He lauds Victor Grayson’s effort to
force parliament to devote adequate
attention to this awful problem. Mr.
Grayson is now organizing the
masses of the unemployed and threat
ens to compel England to heed their
needs. What Victor Grayson will ac
complish with his army—whether a
peaceful march similar to that of J.
S. Coxey in America some twelve
years ago —or whether England will
really see violence in every form,
cannot be predicted; but the “Hooli
gan” element of Great Britain is
likely to prove very untractable once
it is thoroughly aroused.
Thomas Estrada Palma, the first
President of the Cuban Republic,
died at Santiago on November 4.
John Worth Kern, whom our read
ers may recall as a sometime candi
date for Vice President, * has an
nounced that he would like to. go to
the Senate if perfectly agreeable to
his fellow citizens of Indiana. Mr.
Kern’s confiding belief in the long
suffering goodness of the “Hoosier”
state is very engaging.
It is reported that cholera has at
last been stamped out in Manila,
where it had been raging for several
months.
Valdosta, Ga., had a “Harvest
Home” festival this week.
The first hearing on the much
vaunted “tariff revision” will be
held shortly. The policy govern
ing this revision can be foretold
from the speech of Mr. Taft accept
ing the nomination:
“The republican doctrine of pro
tection as definitely announced by the
republican convention of this year
and by previous conventions is that
a tariff shall be imposed on all im
ported products, whether of the farm
or mine, sufficiently great to equal
the difference between the cost of
production abroad and at home, and
that this difference should of course

include the difference between the
higher wages paid'in this country and
the wages paid abroad, and embrace a
reasonable profit to the American
producer. ’ ’
The above can be construed to mean
no relief whatever, and in all prob
ability even greater burdens are to
be imposed upon the masses of Amer
ican people.
The American Federation of Labor
is holding its 28th annual convention
at Denver, Colorado. It is stated

ment and a bitter fight is likely to
ensue. The general feeling is that
Mr. Gompers has lost ground through
what is regarded as over-activity in
politics.
Republican victory in Utah insures
the re-election of Senator Reed
Smoot. The so-called American, or
anti-church, party of that State was
heavily snowed under. This was
largely accomplished by the clever
tactics of the Republican party in
so arranging the tickets that the
voter who would have indorsed the
American party in local polities could
not do so without scratching the
names of the national nominees, and
as the majority of men took more in

worsted at the polls.
The Dalai Lama of Thibet, whose
prolonged meanderings, with his ex
pensive retinue, in the land of his
unwilling host, China, has been men
tioned often of late, is in great luck.
He is to be given SIO,OOO a year,
with orders to go home and stay
there. Few people who outstay their
welcome get so agreeable a package
as this.
Will Canada virtually quit the
British Empire and pursue a peaceful,
uneventful career, or will she lend
herself to the cause of imperialism
by remaining a strong limb of the
Britism Empire? These questions
are clearly brought out in a rather
remarkable speech by Lord Milner, of
England, during his present visit to
Canada, in which he is quoted as say
ing:
“There is one remark I have often
heard from Canadians, not from Eng
lishmen, and that is that the public
life in Canada is unattractive ba
cause there are no big issues. That
seems to me to be an extraordinary
point of view. No big issues! The
next years are going to determine
whether Canada will remain a part
of the British Empire. The decision
of that question rests with Cana
dians alone.
“No external compulsion could be,
certainly none ever would be, exer
cised to influence it. It rests with
them alone. The decision of that
question, and with that question per
haps the decision of the fate of the
empire as a whole. Even in its bad
ly organized condition, the empire
was the greatest political entity in
the world; properly organized it
would be the greatest power.
“It lies with all parts of the em
pire and especially with the people
of the younger dominions, to decide
whether it shall be capable of dis
charging its great mission in the
world.”
The United 'States could not but
feel justly alarmed if Canada should
become imbued with imperialistic
ideas, whereby the peace between the
two countries would necessarily be
endangered directly, or indirectly. It
is quite within the range of probabil
ity, however, that our northern neigh
bor does not look with any consider
able favor upon our branching out as
a “world power,” which means com
plications whose effect no one can
foretell.
Clifford Lanier, brother of the fa
mous Southern poet, Sidney Lanier,
is dead.
It is said that a conflict between
the State and municipal authorities
may be expected at an early date in
Mobile over the prohibition law, the
Governor determining that it shall be
enforced even if the militia is called
out; while the citizens of the town
are openly disposed to view with len
ience infractions of the law.
There has been disobedience,
amounting to grave mutiny, among
the Sultan’s own troops in Constan
tinople and eighty-five of the muti
neers are to be courtmartialed. These
may be punished severely, but the
incident goes to prove how weak has
the iSultan’s power grown over what
was formerly the very bulwark of his
reign—the army. It was the final re
volt of the army which brought him
to consent to a Constitutional Gov
ernment and it now seems that he
cannot count upon any part of it—•
even the troops attached to his own
palace.
