THE VETERANS’ CORNER
THE “BATTLE ABOVE THE
CLOUDS.”
“Will some Vet. answer this?”
Yes. There was a little fight on
Lookout Mountain. I belonged to
the 4 7th Georgia regiment, Jackson’s
brigade, and that brigade was one
of the reserve forces of the Tennes
see army-—Bragg’s. We were camp
ed in the valley, between Mission
Ridge and the Tennessee river. I
do not remember the date, but early
in the morning we had orders to be
ready. About midday we were mov
ed to a position in the valley near
the foot of Lookout Mountain. Just
to our left the mountain was covered
with forest timber, but farther north
and fronting Chattanooga it was
open as though it had been cleared
up, and all of the north end from
Lookout point to the Tennessee river
seemed clear of trees or vegetation.
From the highest northern point to
a considerable distance down to
wards the river it was quite rocky
and precipitous, then for another
good long distance the declivity was
gentle. On that declivity was a
breastwork, perhaps two hundred
feet long, manned by a heavy skirm
ish line, or, if it was a line of battle,
it was a very light one. It seemed to
be about a mile from where we were
stationed, considerably above us and
in full view. Not long after we got
to our position a line of battle of the
enemy appeared between the river
and the breastwork —a very heavy
line —and I think a second line soon
appeared. Fire was opened from
the breastwork and the enemy made
a halt, but soon they closed up and
solidified their ranks and made a
charge, but before they reached the
works, the weak force hastily re
treated in the direction of the timber
south of them. I well remember
two remarks made by Capt. J. S.
Cone, of Scriven County. When the
blue line first came in sight he ex
claimed, “Why can’t we throw a
force of 5,000 men in their rear and
capture that line?” And when the
firing was going on he asid, “I see
now what I have often wished to
see.” When the enemy occupied the
abandoned works they reformed
their lines, and, seemingly in apposi
tion of dress parade, gave three
cheers. They all took off their caps
and waving them over their heads
cried out in concert “huzzah,” wait
ing long enough to take about two
good breaths it was repeated, and
then again—the voices were in con
cert and they seemed to respond to
command as in drill. There was
nothing in the sound resembling the
rebel yell. The Confederate yell,
when they gave three cheers, or one
as for that, was clear, boyish, animat
ing and inspiring, but that “huzzah”
was coarse, almost deep bass and un
earthly in tone, and made me think
of darkness. There was no more
fighting until dark, when a brisk
skirmish began in the timber to
which the little force had retreated
from the breastwork.
Some time after dark our regiment
was moved right to the foot of the
mountain and reinforcements were
sent to the fighting line. By ten
o’clock it was a lively skirmish and
our whole regiment expected to get
into it. Later on the firing moder
ated and gradually quieted away.
We got orders to withdraw after
midnight, and we took the road down
the valley towards McPharland’s
Gap. I very well remember the moon
was in eclipse at the time. There was
no “battle above the clouds.” The
top of the mountain was considerably
above the place where the little fight
occurred. There was no fight up
there. I do not think that a single
gun was fired at the top or anywhere
nearer than the location of the
breastworks. It was a hard, unpleas
ant march to the Gap. The sticky mud
was about ankle deep in the road and
the boys, to avoid it, took the little
paths on each side. Whenever a man
stepped on the slanting side of the
path or road he was almost sure to
fall sprawling in the mud. We ar
rived at McPharland’s Gap about day
light hungry, tired and sleepy, but
within a short time were put in mo
tion to get into position for the bat
tle of Missionary Ridge, which took
place that evening, the result of
which practically ended the military
career of Gen. Braxton Bragg.

“BATTLE ABOVE CLOUDS” A
MYTH.
Dear Sir: —I notice inquiry made
in The Jeffersonian under the head
of “Will Some Old Veteran Answer
This.”
Although I was in the Virginia
army under Gen. Robert E. Lee dur
ing the entire four years of the war
—think I can give the desired infor
mation.
In the first place, “Hooker’s battle
above the clouds” is a myth, and no
one knew it any better than did Gen.
Hooker, though I never heard of him
correcting it.
The idea sent out to the world by
the poetical correspondent was that
the Confederate army was on the top
of Lookout Mountain and that the
Federal army scaled the heights to
the summit —which would be a climb
of 1,700 feet above the valley—and
defeated the Confederate army—in
places they would have been com
pelled to have climbed up perpendic
ular limestone walls from one hun
dred to three hundred feet. You know
they did that.(?)
I visited the place some years ago
just to get the real facts, and have
been well satisfied ever since that I
got them. The real truth of the mat
ter —stripped of all romance—is as
follows:
As I have said, the summit of Look
out Mountain, or point, as they call
it, is 1,700 feet above the valley
where the Federals were, but 300
feet above the valley there is a long,
narrow platform upon which General
Walthall had a Confederate brigade
of a few hundred men—at the end
of this plateau, on the Tennessee
river, it was probably four or five
hundred feet down to the railroad
tracks sloping at an angle of about 50
degrees, covered with huge loose
limestone rocks, where blasting had
131)e Heffersonlan
been done in railroad construction.
On a very foggy night General Hooker
conceived the idea of throwing his
army corps around there, scaling the
heights under cover of the fog and
surprising the Confederates —which
he did, but there was no battle
fought, as the handful of Confeder
ates after skirmishing with them fell
back. After Hooker’s corps got up
there unobserved, both sides were on
comparatively level ground, and I
think the world knows w’hat would
have happened if the numbers on
each side had been equal, or nearly
so. This affair should have been call
ed the skirmish in fog, as the clouds
were too high above to be reckoned
with.
The hungry, half-clad Confeder
ates there that day were not the men
to give way to anything but over
whelming numbers and brute force.
See the history of that war.

HOW “OLD YELLOW” WAS
KILLED.
Dear Sir: —As to the shooting of
E. J. Chapman, of the 29th Georgia
regiment, in Mississippi, I have seen
two or three statements of the shoot
ing. I will give you my statement of
it. The 29th was stationed at Sa
vannah, Ga., and when in the tent he
was taken with a notion to visit Patsy
and the children at Milltown, Berrien
County, Ga., and from there he went
to Mississippi and joined Adams’ cav
alry, and when the brigade went to
Mississippi our quartermaster, J. D.
Cameron, caught Chapman at Can
ton, Miss., and we marched from
there in the direction of Vicksburg,
and at Vernon, Miss., they court-mar
tialed Chapman, and they held up the
sentence until after the seige of Jack
son. We stayed some time and then
we marched from there to Morton
Station, on the Misssissippi Southern,
and when we stopped there the sen
tence was read out at dress parade.
In the evening they did not have time
to execute him, and had to put it off
until next day. The Judge Advocate
of the Court was Major J C. Lamb,
of the 29th regiment. J. C. Lamb
was the first captain of the company
that Chapman belonged to. Major
Lamb got the upper half of his head
shot off at Jackson, and so he got
killed before Chapman was shot. I
will never forgot that killing, as I was
one of the men that was detailed to
shoot him, and also three others out
of my company. He went by the
name of “Old Yellow.” Lieut. A. P.
Parham was in command of the squad
that shot him. My company was
from Franklin County, Ga. J. J.
Owen was our first captain.
This is a correct account of the
shooting of “Old Yellow,” as he was
called.
