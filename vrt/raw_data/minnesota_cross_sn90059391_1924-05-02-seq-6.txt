PRESIDENT MAY SIGN
IMMIGRATION MEASURE
No Serious Complications Will
Arise Prom Japan, Wash
ington Relieves
(Burma of Pabllratlon and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 23-
The Japanese have made a noise, they
jelled like good fellows over the pass
age of the immigration bill contain
ing the Japanese exclusion paragraph,
but it isnT going to undo the splen
did work of congress.
Neither is Japan going to make
war on us for protecting our own peo
81e from the orientals who seek to
ock in here by the tens of thous
sands. The Japanese situation is far
less tense than it was a week ago
and there is not going to be any in
ternational trouble over this matter.
Talk to the contrhry is all bosh. We
do not insult the people of Japan
when we call attention to the fact
♦Hat her people did not fit in well
-vith the people of the United States.
They are two distinct races and ought
not to mix closely when it comes to
residence and living conditions.
There are those who profess to be
lieve that President Coolidge will
▼eto the immigration bill on account
of the Japanese exclusion paragraph,
but the big majorities by which the
bill passed each branch of congress
cannot help but make an impression
on Coolidge.
Of course, the attitude of Secre
tary Hughes is thrown in the balance
on the side of Japan, but it is not be
lieved that even this fact will sway
the president and keep him from sign
ing the bill. Secretary Hughes pre
dicts that the entire work of the
Washington conference will be un
done but he practically stands alone
on that proposition.
The fact is that Japan will prob
ably grin and bear it and the P*°7
pie of the Pacific coast states will
have their way after a long and hard
fight against the Japanese menace to
their country. We may have some
troubles in the far east as a result,
but nothing serious i 3 really expected.
It was thought the president would
have something to say on the sub
ject in his New York speech to the
Associated Press this week, but he re
tained silent on the matter.

BUILDERS STUDY THE WIND
Weather Bureau Recorde Consulted
When Towns Adopt
City Plan.
Washington, D. C„ which was laid
out In 1780 by MaJ. Pierre Charles
L'Knfant, Is cn example of the advan
tages to be obtained from planning
cities with the future well In mind.
The city of Springfield, 111., Is about
to adopt a city plan, contemplating for
the future city, among other features,
a union railroad station, an industrial
district, the creation of a lake In the
valley of the Sangamon river, and a
civic center.
The Industrial sons Is to be located
in tho extreme northeast port ef the
city. Attention was given to the source
of local water supply, proximity to
railroads and terminals, housing con
ditions, and available sites for Indus
trial plants. An Important consider
ation, however, In choosing this loca
tion, wns the prevailing wind direction.
It Is always preferable that smoke,
gases and noise should blow away
from, not over, the residential parts
of the city.
The forty-four-year weather record
of the weather bureau of the United
States Department of Agriculture for
Springfield shows that the prevailing
wind direction Is from the northwest
In January and February, and from the
south during all the other months. It
was clearly Indicated that by locating
the Industrial zone In the northeast,
smoke-bearing winds would blow over
the city but a small part of the time.
Similar plans have been laid out for
several other cities. Local conditions
sometimes make it Impossible to place
the residential section to the windward
of the Industrial zone, but In future
city planning wind direction will no
doubt be given due weight. The
weather bureau has records extending
over long periods for many regions to
Bid In determining th« direction of pre
vailing winds.
SMALL HOUSE IS POPULAR
Scarcity of Reliable Demeetlc Help
and High Prices Tends to Favor
Little Homes.
It Is not an altogether new thing, the
vogue of the little house; It Is, rather,
something In the nature of a very far
reaching revival—a revival that has
suddenly captured the Interest of the
architectural profession and laid siege
to the heart and the purse of a pub
lic wearied by the constantly soaring
cost and Increasingly difficult main
tenance of unnecessarily large houses.
Collier Stevenson, an architect
takes the view that "there Is at pres
ent apparently no hopeful sign of any
considerable diminution In either build
ing or operating costs for years to
come.” He adds, "It Is safe to as
sume thnt the vogue of the little house
will, as time goes on, be an even
more potent Influence than It Is to
day.
“The scarcity of reliable domestic
help—together with the phenomenal
remuneration demanded for even the
Indifferent household service available
—has, of course, tended to popularize
the small house enormously since the
war, not only on this side of the At
lantic, hut also In some of the older
lands across the sea. In England, for
Instance, the seriousness of the help
problem has probably had a very con
siderable bearing upon the recent sale
of many a famous country seat; al
though there, as here, the prevailing
high rate of taxation has undoubtedly
been another powerful argument
against unduly large homes.
"In the not very remote past, high
ceilings and large rooms prevailed In
most of our homes. Even In an other
wise small house, the kitchen was
apt to be relatively large. Efficiency
then was not, and could not be, a
guiding factor In household manage
ment.”—Ladies’ Home Journal.
Small House the Best.
Planting of shrubs and trees about
the house, making the yard practical
ly an outdoor living room and embel
lishing the street and Immediate en
vironment of the houses, Is essential.
So-called back yards should be con
sidered things of the past and gardens
should be substituted. The houee
should be as small as possible. Size
and display do not make for happi
ness. The house should have good
quality, though less quantity. Noth
ing can be gained by way of comfort,
durability or attractiveness from In
ferior construction. Since the cost of
a bouse of good floor plan and ex
terior treatment does not increase in
proportion to an Increase In the else
of rooms, therefore proper space for
furniture and the expression of In
dividuality and taste of the owner or
occupant should not be sacrificed.
Fan Drives an Emery Wheel.
No home worker need be without a
motor-driven emery wheel provided bs
has an electric fan. The fan can be
removed and a small wheel attached
directly to the motor shaft. Small
wheels can be obtained at any hard
ware store for about |L—Popular Sci

“Names Is Names” in

CHICAGO. ILL., April 28—Cic

That isn’t so strange, for in and
around Chicago, but the names of
people implicated in trouble and
also the names on the election bal

a reward of SIOO for the arrest and
conviction of parties using its name
or the initials “K. K. K.” in endeavor

incentive to other fraternal organi
zations to establish memorial rooms
in the new hospital.
PUT BIBLES IN SCHOOLS
JONESBORO, ARK—The Ku Klux
Klan here is very active. They have
recently purchased 100 Bibles and
placed several of them in the public

in the matter of employing trainmen,

of the service. The following is a
conversation said to have been over
heard in Mr. Key’s office a short time
since, between that gentleman and an
applicant for the position of passen
ger conductor.
“Where did you come from?”
“From General Manager St. John
of the Rock Island.”
“What did you come here to do?”
“To learn to subdue my energies
and improve the railway service.”
“Then you are a railroad man, I
infer?”
“I am so taken by all officials that
kn<*w their business.”
“How may I know you to be a rail
road man?”
“By looking over my letters and ex
amining me in the signals. Try me.”
“How will you be tried?”
“By the punch.”
“Why by the punch?”
"Because it is the emblem of hon
esty and the principal working tool
of my profession.”
“Where were you first prepared to
be a railroad man?” ,
“In my mind.”
“Where next.”
“Upon a farm adjoining the right
of way of a regular railroad.”
“How were you prepared?”
“By braking upon a theshing ma
chine for six months, after which I
went to town and sought admission
to the train-master’s office.”
“How gained you admission?”
“By three cigars placed in the open
hand of the trainmaster's clerk.”
“How were you received?”
“Upon the sharp gaze of the train
master applied to my physiognomy
which was thus explained: As it is
always a source of great pleasure to
the trainmaster to receive callers, I
should drop in and chat with him a
little while upon every occasion pos
sible.”
“How were you then disposed of?”
“I was seated in a chair near the
trainmaster’s desk and asked if I put
my trust in safety coupling devices.”
“Your answer?”
“Not if I know myself, I don’t.”
“What was then done with you?”
“I was led up and down the yard
three times to accustom me to the
noise of the train, and then to the
Chief Dispatcher’s office.”
“How were you then disposed of?”
“I was seated upon a brake wheel
before a train box and caused to take
the following horrible and binding
oath:
“I, John Smith, do hereby and here
in most everlastingly and diabolical
ly swear by the great horned spoon,
that r will always remit and never
conceal any of the cash collected by
me as a conductor, and that I will
not cut, make use, collect or remit
any cash fares less than those found
in the regular tariff book.
“I further promise and swear that
I will not carry on my train free any
railroad man’s wife, mother, sister,
daughter or widow, or permit any
other conductor to do so if I can pre
vent it.
“I further promise and swear that
