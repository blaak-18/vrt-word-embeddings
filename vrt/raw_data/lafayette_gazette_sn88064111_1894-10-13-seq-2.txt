in local affairs at a comparatively r
early age. Lawyers usualy have an v

GOOD NEWS ABOUT R CE.
Within the past few day sone of the planters
in this locality has received- a letter from
Messrs. Dan Talmage's S ns, New Yorlt.'
We select a portion which is of more than
general interest. They state:
"The Rice growers along the Atlantic
Coast received a sorry set-back in the heavy
wind and rain storm of last week. By it the
quality was impaired and quantity reduced.
"It is an ill wind that blows nobody any
good" and the one referred to ought to re
dound to the benefit of the Louisiana pro
duct as the Carolina people will want all
they can get for their remnant crop.
"In regard to the Rice market, would
say that high average range of prices still
prevails an outcome most encouraging for
the producer, as all arriving parcels offered j
at current rates find ready sale. The crop 1
is being forwarded just right, i. e. with de
liberation, and so far as we can learn, satis
factory prices generally secured. This cer
tainly is the way to do it and if planters are
able to maintain such policy good fair v.a-.es
will be assured. The expectPt-- arrival of
new crop has checked imports of Foreign
and white they will undoubtedly continue,
the volume is likely to be limited and they,
therefore, not nearly so much of a compet
itor with home Rice as heretofore. Another
encouraging feature is that the war in the
East between Japan and Corea has raised
prices in the far East and it would not sur
prise us to see them advance still further.
C >rea generally exports a conns;.ieah!c I
quantity of Rice but as Ltle scat of war is
located in theirrt.r "producing sections the
I culture hs.s been generally abandoned and
:ey will, therefore, have to buy from other "
countries, which has already had its due
effect upon prices as noted. Japan, which
is the Foreign style most largely used in the
United States, is just now Out of reach but t
wall probably come down somewhat withi
the incoming of their new crop in Novem- t
ber-December, ordinarily received here '
about February-March. The time we
speak of is the usual harvesting period but
the scarcity of labor is likely to cause delay, t
thus injuring quality and to some extent re
ducing quantity." it
