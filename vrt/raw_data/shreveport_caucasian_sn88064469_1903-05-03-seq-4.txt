dated cditrially in a recent issue of the t
Caucasian. A -\-we taid then, and may
reiterate now,, the poor man is a handy
and a ready grab-on, on which the never
weary and the untiring feeders expect
to hold their cribs at the public feeding.
but the "poor man' has been worn into t
a superannuated state, into frazzles as
it were, until the "poor man," as well
as the "horny handed" and the "honest I
toilers" are protesting and decline to
be the footstools of political schemers,.
and of men who would reach power by
crawling over their shoulders. The poor
man is no idiot, and if he is good c
enough to vote at a general or a special h
election, when qualified, he should be
equally as good to express his opinionr
and his choice at a primary election for a
the nomination of officials. who are to
exercise authority over him if they "get a
in." The poor man should insist on his o
right to decide who is to be his political
boss, and as a reasonable sensible man
he should and does object to a lot of L
scif-constituted bosses to boss him and o
pick out his boss. But here is the edit
orial of the Guardian-Journal which t
should be perused carefully and delib- tl
erately:
"POOR MEN.
Some of the opponents of primaries
are very much concerned about the
poor. If direct primaries should he
adopted as the method of making nomi
nations no poor man, we are gravely in
formed, could be a candidate for gov
ernor or for any other State office. A
poor man, they say, could not afford the
expense of making a canvass of the
State. Only rich men could afford the
expense of making such a canvass of
the State as would be necessary tinder
the direct primary system.
"But, under a proper state of public
sentiment, would not the candidates for
governor and other State offices make a
canvass of the State, whatever might be
the method of nominating? Would not
the people demand as much? Can intel
ligent people be expected to support a
candidate for governor and other im
portant State offices whom the; have
not heard from on the issues of the day?
It seems to .us that there can be only
.one answer to this question. The people
will want to hear from the candidates
under any method of nominating before
the nominations are made, and they do
hear from them in most of the states.
And, if the people ought to hear from
the candidates before the nominations
are made, the canvass under the pri
mary method need not be any more ex
pensivesthan under the convention sys
tem o rany other system.
"The direct primary method prevails
in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina
and other Southern States, and we have
not heard that poor men have been
thereby debarred from becoming candi
dates in those States. There are four
candidates for governor now on the
stump in Mississippi, and certainly they
are not all rich men. Poor men have
made no complaint against primaries is,
any of the states in which they prevail
so far as we have heard.
"But how do poor men fare in con
ventions as a rule? Are not can-!idates
expected to spend money rather freely
tmder that method of making nom;na
tions? And are the candidates entitled
to all the consideration'? Are not the
voters fairly and justly entitled to some
consideration? And there can be no
doubt but that the primary methol is
more convenient and less expensive than
the convention system for the gre t i:ia
jority of the v. ters How many poo:
men can afford to attend conventions
and enjoy the luxury of a direct voice in
selecting party candidates? All can of
ford to go to the polls and vote under
the direct primary method."
LOUISIANA DAY.
N. O. Picayune, April 30: On April
3o, 1803, was consummated at Paris the
treaty which ceded the vast territory of
Louisiana from the government of Na
poleon the Great to the United States of
America. The treaty is signed by Rob
ert R. Livingston and James Monroe on
the part of the United States, and by
Barbe Marbois acting for the French
Emperor.
This treaty declares in Article III
that " the inhabitants of the ceded ter
ritory shall be incorporated in the
Union of the United States and admit
ted as soon as possible, according to the
principles of the Federal Constitution,
to the enjoyment of all the rights, ad
vantages and immunities of citizens of e
the United tSates; and in the meantime
they shall be maintained and protected

no Grover Cleveland's desertion of the

an nee of the party on the Kansas City

,, gize for our expressions under the head
ns "Why Discredit Bryan," and since we
in have perused the Vernon News' version,
>- we must change our views and ac
er cordingly, admit that it was not Cleve
land who, having deserted the party
aided and abetted in the defeat of Bry
an, but it was the six millions and more
i of Democrats who voted for Mr. Bryan
he who deserted Mr. Cleveland. It is all
of plain now.

St. Louis. May 2.-Just like a calm
after a st()lt was li'nternational day"
at the ';losition, -omlpared with "Ied
icatioin lay.' which preceded it. The
day's programme was carried out as
planned. boi there were numerous de
lays. the weather was ideal, but it
was rather cold and damp in the Lib
eral Arts building and only about 1200
persons listened to the speeches of for
eign representatives. The manage
ment of the crowds was even better
than Thursday.
The speeches were beard by every
body in the hall, and it so happened
that nearly all of the speakers were
possessed of stronger toices, perhaps
excepting President Roosevelt, than the
men who were compelled to talk
against the noise created by the crowd
that filled the building Thursday.
The French ambassador, M. Jusse
rand. made a distinct hit with the
audience and was frequently inter
rupted by applause. Senor Ojedo was
cheered to the echo as he advanced to
make his address. Former Senator
John 31. Thurston, president of the
day, alluded, as he introduced the min
ister, to the late trouble with Spain,
declaring that the ill feeling againist
that country had passed away.
greatly enjoyed by the 300 persons
The breakfast to the diplomats was
who participated. From the large ta
ble, where were seated the diplomatic
corps, Grover Cleveland, Mr. Frantis
and others, frequent sounds of laughter
rose. At the conclusion of the meal
President rFancis rose and proposed a
toast to the foreign representatives.
"whose presence indicates the friendli
ness of their governments and their
good wishes towards the Jouisiana
Purchase exposition."
A volley of handclapping greeted the I
toast and ceased suddenly only be
cause it was necessary to use one of
the noisemaking members t. raise
glasses.
At noon the assembly was called to
order by Corwin H. Spencer. chairman
of the exposition commission on cere
monies. The invocation was delivered
by the Rev. Carl Swensson, following
which Senator John M. Thurston of the
national commission, was introduced
as president of the uay. Mr. Spencer
introduced President Francis of the ex
position, who greeted the foreign rep
resentatives.
After the rendition of selection by
the Marine band of Washington the
French minister, M. Jesserand, replied
to President Francis.
Following the Hallelujah chorus;
from the Messiah the Spanish minister,
Senor Don Emilio de Ojedo, spoke
for Spain. He said in part: "As a
guest, sitting now for the first time
at the hearth of the American nation,
I feel bound to respond to that high
tribute paid to Spain by publicly ac
knowledging the enviable kindness
shown by all clases of your people
since I landed on your shores. As the
representative of the nation, whose an
cient and honored nag was the first
to be reflected in the majestic course
of the fatner of American rivers. I am,
happy to feel t(tat my first official ap
pearance before an American audience
is associated in both your minds ann
mine, with the commemmoration,
which although involving farreaching
issues in the histories of three great
nations, have not and never was dar
kened by the actual rankling memories
which wars and international strife al
ways leave in their wake. i
"You can rest assured, Mlr. President, i
that my country will contribute to the
World's fair and enhance with its
varied exhibits its universal and his-i
torical features. I am in fact author
ized to inform you that his majesty's
government has decided to ask for the
requisite appropriation as soon as par
liament assemnles. And now, Mr.
President, in wishing success to your
noble undertaking, in thanking you and
this city fo rits cordial hospitality, 6
beg to acknowledge also my gratitude
for the numerous~tokens and expres
sions of good wi, toward Spain which
have been uttered during this solemn
celebration and which I so fully ap
preciate."
The exerciies closed by a ber,edic
tlon pronounced by Rev. Samuel H.
Nichols. and as the distinguished
guests left the hall a salute of 100 guns
was fired.
