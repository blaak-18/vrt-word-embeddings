G. M. DAVIS’ TALK TO THE
FARMERS,
The springtime is at hand, and with
it the plowing land preparing foir
the year’s crop. Many have already
broken dirt on the new year’s crop,
but it is to be feared that this dirt
breaking has not been with any syste
matic arrangement to lessen the
acreage in cotton or to increase the
amount planted in com and food
crops.
This is the time to fix the price of
both cotton and food crops for next
fall. A large acreage in cotton with
good seasons and favorable condi ions
means low cotton when the selling
time comes.
The low price is the very thing the
grower of cotton does not want, and
the very thing he can prevent if
he will take final and decisive action
between now and the first of May.
What is done towards getting better
prices for cotton must be done now.
The holding of cotton is all right
in its proper time land place, but if
a large acreage is put in and the
conditions are favorable to yield the
holding proposition becomes more’
acute and less remunerative than
if the acreage is very materially de
based in the earlier months, or at
ding time. For instance, if a
is in sight the mills and
buyers are both to enter the market
actively and when they do it is at a
much lower figure than they deem
the staple to be actually worth.
More men have to hold and hold
a larger per cent of their crop if
they expect to even maintain a bread
and meat price for the stuff. This
necessarily causes the farmer to be
longer out of -his money and brings
about other financial loss, such as
loss in weight and interest on his
money.
The whole thing resolves itself into
this: The planting time is the time
to fix, in a large measure, the price
of cotton for the fall months. It
is the time to force the market to
very low prices that may be deter
mined on later in the season and the
real time to get the thing in shape
to do just what you want done in
the way of prices.
Cut two acres from each plow
and plant corn. By doing this you
force cotton up and corn down. Had
this been done |las't spring cotton
would have been selling today for
15 cents per pound, and corn a great
deal cheaper than what it is. You
would have made 50 per cent more
on your cotton and saved 50 per
cent on your corn, thus greatly in
creasing your wealth. Had you got
ten 15 cents for cotton instead of
the price you did, you would have
many millions more money.
Go to work right now and cut. Do
not wait for your neighbor to do so.
Show your faith by your works,
and you will be both the gainer and
the winner next fall when you need
to have things coming your way.

TO BUILD WAREHOUSES.
The county “Business Agents” of
the Georgia Union, convened during
the meeting of the National Union
in Atlanta.
One among the leading features
of the meeting of the Agents, was to
arrange to build warehouses. The
‘‘Business Agents” are now pushing
the plan throughout Georgia. Local
companies of farmers will be organ
ized and incorporated with sufficient
capital to build the warehouses to re
ceive the product of the farmers and
store it until fair prices prevail.
A great many warehouses have al
ready been built in the state on this
plan, and each of the seventy-five
county “Business Agents” in atten
dance, immediately on his return
home, will begin to organize loe.al
companies, and by the next state
convention many counties will be
able to report the erection of ware
houses. The movement for building
warehouses co-operatively by the
farmers is spreading rapidly over the
South.
TENNESSEE UNION.
Rejoices Over Adoption of Its Consti
tution.
All the delegates are rejoicing over
the vote and adoption of the national
constitution, and to say that all union
men here are enthusiastic over the
victory won on the sale of cotton this
season would be putting it too mildly.
Renewed courage, renewed hope, stim
ulated determination has resulted, and
the union in Tennessee is facing tho
east today with the joy of victory, a
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
great victory to crown our efforts, bu
oying up their hearts and quickening
the life’s blood in their veins. Too
long have they worn the shackles of
the slave; too long have they been
the prey of the spoilator, and today
they start forward on a new journey,
to a happy goal—industrial freedom, a
fair reward for their toil and their en
ergy.
“Warehouses*” is the war cry of the
union in Tennessee, as in Texas and
other states. Many sales of cotton
from warehouses already built and
places where cotton has been bulked
by the union have resulted in the sav
ing to the union cotton farmers of
Tennessee of more than $200,000 over
and above the prices paid by the local
buyers.
This is a time when every farmer,
north and south, should stand closely
together. A great change in commer
cialism is now on. Let the war cry
be for warehouses for cotton and to
bacco, and elevators for grain, and
when this great fight has been ended
and above the prices paid by the local
and not until then, will the producers
of the wealth of our country receive
just compensation for their labor.

PEACH LEAF CURL DISEASE
AND SAN JOSE SCALE.
Remedial Measures Recommended by
the State Board of Entomology—
Thorough Spraying Advocated—
Important Recommendation.
By R. I. Sm ht, State Entomologist.
Peach growers in North and Mid
dle Georgia were greatly alarmed last
spring by the unusual number of
peach trees affected by the Leaf Curl
disease. Many orchards were injured
so severely that the crop was ‘ short
ened from twenty-five per cent to
seventy-live per cent, and an occa
sional orchard even more severely.
In order that this condition may be
prevented this year, the writer wish
es to sound a warning to orchardists
whose orchards were affected last
season. Experiments have shown
conclusively that the disease may be
almost entirely prevented by the ap
plication of proper fungicides early
in February. AVe now know definite
ly that the best results from spraying
for the leaf curl are derived by treat
ing the trees fully one month before
the blooming period. Hence the rea
son why this advice is being publish
ed at this date. Spraying now,
as recommended herein, will, also,
control the San Jose scale as well
as the leaf curl.
Peach Leaf Curl Disease Caused by
Fungus.
It may be well to explain briefly
the cause of the Leaf Curl disease,
so that growers will fully understand
why the spraying is of advantage.
Leaf Curl is started in spring by
spores of a fungus which live over
winter on the twigs and around the
buds of the peach trees. These spores
are microscopic in size, and, of
course, cannot be detected with the
naked eye, even by the most expert
investigators. It is almost certain,
however, that these spores are pres
ent now on all trees where the disease
was observed last year. In one sense
the matter of spraying for Leaf Curl
may be said to be an insurance,
rather than a remedy, for, in some
cases, it is impossible to forecast the
occurrence of the disease. To wait
until the disease appears, is, how
ever, a disastrous practice, for leaf
curl can not be stopped after the
leaves commence to curl.
Immediate Spraying Necessary.
It should be clearly understood
why early spraying is necessary. The
reason may be explained briefly as
follows:
As stated above, the spores of leaf
curl live over winter on and around
the buds. Application of fungicides
kill these external spores. If spray
ing is delayed until about the time
the trees are ready to bloom, the
spores may have commenced to ger
minate, and may have pushed into
the unopened buds. After the fun
gus, arising from the spores, once
gains entrance to the buds and at
tacks the tissue within, no outside
application of spray will prevent the
disease from developing •with the leaf.
In other words, the leaf curl fungus
may get its first start in the unop
ened buds, and if that occurs the
disease will appear in spite of spray
ing. Experiments have shown that
early spraying kills the spores of th
fungus before the buds are affected.
AVhere trees are properly sprayed
one month before the blooming period
‘■he disease may be almost entirely
prevented.
Remedial Measures Advocated.
Either Bordeaux mixture or lime
sulphur wash may be used as a spray
to prevent leaf curl. The former is
the most easily prepared and applied,
and we recommend its adoption in
all orchards where there is no danger
from the San Jose scale. Lime-sul
phur wash should be used against
leaf curl in all orchards where the
San Jose scale is present. Recent
experiments in Georgia and other
states have shown that the lime-sul
phur wash—a proven remedy for the
scale—will also prevent leaf curl.
Bordeaux Mixture is made by the
following formula:
Stone Lime (fresh, unslaked), 6 lbs.
Copper Sulphate (bluestone) .4 lbs.
Water .. .. . 50 gallons.
Directions for Preparing; Provide
three barrels for mixing. Slake the
lime with a small amount of water
(preferably warm), in one barrel.

sack and suspend in 25 gallons of
water for a few hours. Or if it is
desired to dissolve quickly, grind the
bluestone into a fine powder and dis
solve in a small amount of warm
water. We should now have 25 gal
lons of lime solution and 25 gallons
of bluestone solution.
To prepare, the Bordeaux mixture
