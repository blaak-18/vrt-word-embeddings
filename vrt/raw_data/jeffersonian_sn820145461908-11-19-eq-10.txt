MR. WATSON’S ADDRESS.
(Continued from Page Seven.)
of farmers led by a farmer that met
Great Britain in the shock of arms.
“At the dark crisis of the revolu
tion in the north when the treason
of Benedict Arnold threatened ruin
to the whole American cause, it was
three farmers who saved the day. To
his captors the British spy, Major
Andre, a scion of the aristocracy of
Great Britain, in an agony of fear,
made every tempting offer —his mag
nificent gold watch, his well-filled
purse, the promise of riches to each
of the poor men who were captors—
to secure his freedom. To his offers
the reply was as prompt and simple
as it was sublime. ‘We are only poor
men, but the king of England has not
got money enough to buy us.’
“At the crisis of our affairs in the
south during this same revolution,
the day was saved at Kings Moun
tain by southern farmers. Furnish
ing their own guns and ammunition,
furnishing their own horses and pro
visions, the farmers of north Geor
gia, of Tennessee, of southern Vir
ginia and of tht Carolinas, sprang in
to their saddles and of their own ini
tiative gave chase to the left wing
of the army of Cornwallis which was
ravaging the country with fire and
sword, surrounded it, fought it to a
finish, annihilated it and thus turned
the tide of war, making one success
the stepping stone to another until
the consummation of British destruc
tion and American triumph at York
town.
Fanners in War of 1812.
“When shame and disaster along
the Canadian frontier in the war of
1812 had bent the heads of the na
tion in humiliation and desperation,
it was the farmers of the south and
west, under the leadership of a west
ern fanner .and southern farmer, that
redeemed the glory of our arms and
reanimated the spirit of our people
in the battle of the Thames and in
the glorious triumph of New Orleans.
“What has the government ever
done for this man?
“Last summer one of the great po
litical parties which dominates us
made a boast of the fact that it
had done so much for the farmer. To
what fact did they allude? To the
fact that they had spent twenty-three
million dollars for t-he benefit of the
farmer in giving him mail facilities
somewhat equal to those given to the
manufacturer and the people engaged
in inland commerce? In other words,
but of the hundreds of millions of
dollars which the farmer pays into
the national treasury the government
after lavishing millions of it upon the
steel trust —which wanted more con
tracts for battleships—and after
spending other millions of it upon the
Philippines, and after squandering
other millions of it in paying the rai'
roads the most absurd prices so.
hauling mail, and after squandering
other millions of it for keeping up ex
pensive custom-house establishments
TSfyc 3effersonlan
at ports hundreds of miles from the
seacoast, and keeping up other cus
tom-house establishments at seaports
where no imports pass through, and
after squandering other millions of
it in erecting the most expensive pub
lic buildings in the city of Washing
ton, and in almost every other city
throughout the union—actually have
the generosity to spend the pitiable
sum of twenty-three millions for the
direct benefit of those over-taxed ag
riculturists who pay the greater por
tion of the revenues of the federal
government!
“They don’t even claim that they
have done anything else for you.
They don’t even claim that they have
endeavored to win for you a broader
market by so shaping our tariff legis
lation as to conciliate foreign
countries who naturally would be
your customers and who are driven
to patronize Great Britain, France
and Germany because of the provo
cation given to them by such infa
mies of legislation as the Dingley bill.
Cites the Steel Trust.
“The government has deliberately
given to the steel trust such special
privileges, such a monstrous monop
oly, that its own reports disclose the
fact that the trust during the year
1907 piled up a larger sum in. net
profits than all the agricultural class
es had been able to pile up during the
ten years from 1890 to 1900. In ag
ricultural pursuits there was invested
during that period capital in amounts
ranging from sixteen billions of dol
lars to twenty billions of dollars.
There were employed six million of
laborers. Yet with all their toil and
industry in bringing forth such enor
mous quantities of produce as were
never before known in the history
of the world, the records show that
the farmers made only $123,000,000 —
not more than living wages—whereas
the steel trust, as shown by the same
official record, clears every year from
$100,000,000 to $190,000,000.
“The government has given to the
tobacco trust those laws which stifle
competition and logically brought
about those conditions which today
are driving the grower of tobacco to
desperation and night riding and have
made of the retailer nothing more
than a poorly paid clerk of the trust.
Oppressed Tobacco Grower.
“To the manufacturers the govern
ment has given such monstrous favors
in the way of special legislation that
the cotton growers of the south are
pretty much in the same condition as
the tobacco growers. There is no
doubt that there was a conspiracy
among the spinners and the specu
lators to keep down the price of this
year’s crop. The effect is the same
as having but one buyer in the mar
ket.
“What is it the government could
'jave done and has not done for the
farmer? It could have kept off the
robbers instead of arming them with
class legislation, which legalized their
robbery. It could have negotiated
