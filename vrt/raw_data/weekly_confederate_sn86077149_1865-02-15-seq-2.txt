I A speciAl dispatch to the Tinus says : Lincoln
' infor:i;ed the Commissioners at every po:nt that
recognition wa- utterly out of the question : that
the Uniti-d States could stop the war only on condi
i tioa precedent that tLe auth i ity of the National
; Govt nmen,t should be recoi.iaed and obeyed over
the vbt,Ie territorv of the United St a Us. This
point conceded, he assured them fiat upon every
other muttrr of ditiVrence they would.be treated
i w ith ihe utmt.-st liberality. " '
i Another telegram snye Stephens was the most
hbeinl of the rebel deputation, ills theory was,
! that if we would bat treat with tbem as an ir.de
L pendent nation, that such agreerpent could le had
j as would, practically, unite JNortu and feouth.
A special tu th Tiibune says: Stephens gur-
passed. ad his old exhibitions ot shrewdness and
, force iu. putting rorth the demand-' or the Conred
acy. At the conclusion of one of his points, Lin-
i coin, leaning forward, interrupted him with
I "that reminds me ot . a little story. A man in

, ia warm merriment. Aster tue story, resumed,
