Os Interest to Wealth Producers
Editor The Jeffersonian:
Please find enclosed set of questions
which were sent me some time batk
by the commission appointed by the
President to enquire into the condi
tions of the country and country life.
If you think my answers are worthy
of notice, will be pleased if you will
publish same. Will say, am in for the
war during my life.
Most truly,
Horace Hicks.
Ashford, Ala.
First. Are the farm homes in your
neighborhood as good as they should
be under existing conditions? Yes,
“under existing conditions,” but not
as good as they might be.
Why? Money goes from the Gov
ernment to the banks at one-half of
one per cent and reaches the country
burdened with 12 1-2 per cent, too
much for production and labor.
What suggestion do you make ? Let
the people have money from the Gov
ernment at 4 or 5 per cent, returnable
in so many installments yearly, then
conditions would improve.
'Second. Are the schools training
boys and girls satisfactorily for life
on the farms? No, nor for anywhere
else. Why? The appropriations are
insufficient and the system looks away
from fundamentals too soon. What
suggestions? Better appropriations
and more careful looking to the fun
damental training.
Third. Do the farmers get the re
turns they reasonably should for the
sale of their products? No. Why?
The money changers manipulate the
markets and control prices contrary
to the interest of the farmers. What
suggestions? Let the people have
cheap money from the Government
and the money changers then cannot
manipulate the markets and force
sales.
Four. Do they receive from the
postal service, rural telephones, etc.,
the service they should? We have no
rural telephone service by the Govern
ment here. The postal is the best
service we have of any sort. Why?
Because it is run by the government
in the interest of the people. What
suggestions? Let us have postal sav
ings banks and the country will be
greatly benefited.
Five. Are the farmers and their
wives satisfactorily organized to pro
mote their mutual interests? They
are not organized for such purposes.
Why? They think it unnecessary.
Suggestion. With a money system in
the interest of the people there would
be no call for such organization.
Six. Are the renters making a sat
isfactory living? No. Why? Ans
wer to Question 1 applies in this case;
also suggestion.
Seven. Is the supply of farm la
bor satisfactory? No. Why? Pub
lic works pay better wages than prices
of farm productions will authorize;
that makes the farm laborer dissatis
fied. Suggestions? Farmers should
arrange to hire as little as possible.
Eight. Have the farmers satisfac
tory facilities for doing their business
in banking, credit, insurance, etc. ?
No. Why? The banks charge too
much interest and if a man fails in
his crop, they can close him out and
ruin him. Suggestion? Let the Gov
ernment bank for the people and there
will be away out, if disaster comes,
as it does at times.
Nine. Are the sanitary conditions
satisfactory? No. Why? Much of
the land holds too much moisture for
good health. Suggestions? If people
could get cheap money they could
drain the sunken lands, thereby im
proving the health and increasing pro
duction.
Ten. Do the railroads give such ser
vice as they should? No. Why?
They give such service as they choose
and farmers submit because they can
not help themselves. What sugges
tion? Let the Government own and
run them in the interest of the peo
ple.
Eleven. Do the farmers and their
wives get together for their mutual
improvement, entertainment and so
cial intercourse as they should? No.
Why? Can not tell, nor make sugges
tion.
What general suggestion do you
make? Let the Government put mon
ey in easy reach of the people, un
burdened by heavy usury and the
country will grow prosperous, will be
beautified and will blossom as a flow
er garden.
CURB TRUSTS TO UPLIFT FARM-
ERS, HE TELLS PRESIDENT’S
COMMISSION.
The following has been sent to the
Commission on Country Life appoint
ed recently by President Roosevelt for
the purpose of gathering information
upon which to base a movement for
the uplifting of the farmers:
Berlin, Pa., Nov. 17.
Herewith I submit my answers to
the questions you have addressed to
farmers and others. I am an ex-farm
er, an ex-editor and at present a
postmaster. In the absence of a spare
blank I typewrite both questions and
answers.
1. Are the farm homes in your
neighborhood as good as they should
be under existing conditions? No.
Why? The fixing of the prices of
what the farmers sell and what they
buy, by the trusts and monopolies, de
prives them of the means of making
their conditions any better.
What suggestions have you to
make? Abolish the trusts and monop
olies. This does not mean the aboli
tion of the corporations, but of the
combinations formed by the corpora
tions and the possessors of other bod
ies of capital.
2. —Are the schools of your neigh
borhood training boys and girls sat
isfactorily for life on the farm? No.
Why? No instruction is given in
forestry, soil fertilization and studies
relating specifically to farm needs.
What suggestions have you to
make? Supply the omission.
3. —Do the farmers in your neigh
borhood get the returns they reasona
bly should from the sale of their
products ? No.
Why? Owing to the fact that the
trusts or monopolies fix the prices
at which the farmer sells his prod
ucts.
<sl>e Jeffersonian
What suggestions, etc.? Prevent
the formation and maintenance of
monopolistic combinations.
4. —Do the farmers in your neigh
borhood receive from the railroads,
highroads, trolley lines, etc., the ser
vice they reasonably should have?
Not from the railroads.
Why? The railroads have gone in
to combinations and through the op
portunities afforded by these combi
nations exact extortionate passenger
and freight rates from the farmers.
What suggestions, etc. ? Abolish
the combinations.
5. —Do the farmers in your neigh
borhood receive from the United
States postal service, rural telephone,
etc., the service they reasonably
should expect ? Not from the postal
service.
Why? They are without postal sav
ings banks and the parcels post.
What suggestions, etc.? Establish
these needs.
6. —Are the farmers and their wives
in your neighborhood satisfactorily or
ganized to promote their mutual buy
ing and selling interests? Are not
organized in this section.
Why ? Presumably prefer, as a
rule, to trade with their home mer
chants, as they are now T doing.
What suggestions, etc.? None.
7. —Are the renters of farms in
your neighborhood making a satisfac
tory living? No.
Why? Like the owners of farms,
they are working under the handicap
of trust extortion.
What suggestions, etc.? Prohibit
the forming and maintaining of mo
nopolies.
8. —ls the supply of farm labor in
your neighborhood satisfactory? Yes.
Why? There are enough country
bred boys and girls willing to work
for what, under existing conditions, is
a fair remuneration.
What suggestions, etc.? None.
9. —Are the conditions surrounding
hired labor on the farms in your
neighborhood satisfactory to hired
men? No.
Why? Owing to trust domination
and exaction the farmers are not able
to retain enough of what they earn to
pay the men what they actually should
have.
What suggestions, etc.? Abolish the
monopolies.
10. —Have the farmers in your
neighborhood satisfactory facilities
for doing their business in banking,
insurance, etc.? Not in banking.
Why? Should have the postal sav
ings bank.
What suggestions, etc.? Supply the
omission.
11. —Are the sanitary conditions of
the farms in your neighborhood satis
factory? No.
Why? The under-remuneration of
the farmers, through trust exaction,
deprives the farmers of the means of
providing satisfactory sanitary condi
tions.
What suggestions, etc.? Prohibit
the formation of monopolies.
12. —Do the farmers and their
wives and families in your neighbor
hood get together for mutual improve
ment, entertainment and social inter-
