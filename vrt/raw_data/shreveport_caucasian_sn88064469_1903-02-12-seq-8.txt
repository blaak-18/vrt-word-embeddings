DONE IN A FE W DAYS
Emphasis Continues to Be Laid Upon
the Contention That the i Allies
Desire Separate, Not Pref.
erentiai Treatment.
London, Feb. 7.-it is officially stht.
ed here that the allies' offer )0 sub
mit the method of treatment of their
claims to arbitration is a concession
which should facilitate rather than de
ay a speedy settlement of the Vene
suelan affair. The allies will raise the
bloekade as soon as the protocol em
bodying the arbitration agreement to
signed and not await the decision of
The Hague court of arbitration or that
at President Roosevelt.
At the German embassy it is stated
the" blockade should be raised within
a few days. Emphasis continues to be
laid on the contention that the point
e aRies now agree to arbitrate is not
peferential but separate treatment of
their claims. In the event of Presi
dent Roosevelt declining to arbitrate,
which seems to be anticipated, the al
Ilei are willing to immediately preo
'pe.e their case for The Hague court
t arbitratlon, the outlines of which
woid be embodied in th3 protocol
with Venesuela and upon Minister
Bowen paying the .ash promised, the
protocol would be signed and the
rckade would end.
These statements are all mhade on
the proviso that the previous arrange
