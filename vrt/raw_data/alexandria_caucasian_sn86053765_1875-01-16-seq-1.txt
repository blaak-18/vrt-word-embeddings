every confidence iu his integrity, we feel
justitiedjin aaying we believe he will car
rv out his Distribution honestly and fai
ly." Signed by the Mayor, Hon. J. T. D
Wilson, aud the Cit.v Council.
That old aud reliable paper, the Hous
ton Telegraph, which rarely condescends
to notice individual enterprises, says of
the Firnt Drawing:
"{Not even the mivst captious aud sus
pecting person could take exceptions to
the manner of the drawing. It was fair,
honorable aud eijuitahle. " The commit
toe and recorders were of our very bent
citizens, aud kindly gave their time and
labor to tho superintendence of the draw
ing, or rather did the actual labor of it.[
"C aw . FOSTER has acted honorably
and fairly throughout tho whole manage
ment of this enterprise. While some
money has been made by the venture in
all probability, yet the property given as
prizos has only uetted a fair price, and the
profit is only an exchange of the property
for cash."
That staunch Democratic paper, the
Houston Age, lias the following:
"THE COMMUTE
of gentlemen was oue of the best that
could have been selectod by the audience
Hon. D. II. ' Barziza, who supervised the
drawing, is our present Representative
aud one of the most .popular men iu the
district.
THE DRAWING
was prefaced by au explanation from
G ait FOSTER, of the mode adopted
This was well received aud understood
precisely as explained by the circulars
C avi '. FOSTER said that while he wish
ed all his home people gobd! luck, he yet
was free to say that with the people of
p<mr Mississippi, Louisiana and South Car
olina, lie felt a greater sympathy, aud lie
«lid hope they would draw the largest
number of prizes, that they might come to
a free country, and make a white man's
living. This seutimeut was received with
loud cheers.
"The drawing was then proceeded with,
and the result is announced elsewhere."

that disgraces th« country and threatens
the overthrow of republican institutions
It has no fear of knaves, aud seeks no ta
vors from their supporters.

ious are regularly reported iu it* columns
The price of th» WEEKLY SUN is one
