A DAY OP PLEASURm.
tom- 1s of the w .ouenalve
' aWs of Cresero Entertsailned
Sevein Husdred Ezeunraionlts
From Thibodau Houman
and other plee...
We had attended many church
fairs, some of them real big ones,
but last Sunday was the first time
that we had the pleasure of being
present at one of Father LaForest's
fairs. The beloved pastor of the
Carencro Catholic church is well
known for his public spirit and seal,
and to his indefatigable energy is
due much of the success of the fair
and entertainment of last Sunday.
It was through his well-directed
efforts that an excursion train was
run from Houma, bringing to Cat
encro six or seven hundred people,
mostly from the towns of Thibo
daux, Houma and Chacahoula.
We believe this is the first time
that Carencro had so many strangers
within her gates, but judging from
the way the hundreds of guests were
taken care of, one would think that
Careacro was an -'old hand" at re
ceiving and entertaining large
crowds of people.
At about 1s o'clock the train,
consisting of six coaches, full of
people, arrived and stopped oppo
site the fair grounds. The tables,
booths, flags and decorations were
placed in a position to meet the
view of the excursionists immedi
ately upon their arrival.
The excursionists lost no time in
getting off from the train and soon
wended their way -toward the place
where the preparations had been
made for their reception. Just at
this time it began to rain, but thanks
to the foresight of Father LaForest
a sufficient number of tents had
been erected to afford shelter to all.
Fortunately the rain did not con
tinue and in the latter part of the
afternoon the weather was clearer
and nothing else happened to mar
the pleasure of the day.
Lovers of the national game had
ample opportunity to indulge in
their favorite pastime as several in
teresting games of base ball were
played, the principal one being be
tween the boys from Carencro
bridge and a nine from this town.
In justice to the latter we must say
that they were out of practice, this
being their first game this season.
Here is the score.

The next game was played by the
Lafayette boys against those of
Chacahoula. By this time, our
boys were beginning to feel like
playing ball and they "wiped the
earth "with the Chacahoulians.
The concert was commenced at
3 o'clock and was a very creditable
affair from begining So end. The
children of the parochial school
under the efficient management of
Miss Madeleine Melchoir, did ad
mirably well. The calisthenic ex
ercises showed careful training, and
too much praise can not be bestowed
upon Miss Florina Grenier for this
pleasing feature of the entertain
ment. "La Fete de Carencro," a
song, was well rendered by Miss
Melchoir's pupils. It elicited
merited applause and made a de
cided hit. Miss Sara Brown's sing
ing was so well received that she
was compelled to favor the audience
with an encore.
The others on the program, which
follows, filled their parts well.

might expert to see at a fair.
Thee ice-crea.m aud lemnonade

ranged
The post-office was exceedingly
neat and showed much taste. The
latest approved way in which the
special delivery system was managed
by the young ladies would put to
shame Uncle Sam's -most expe
Sienced employes.
The dinner tables were well kept.
A good, substantial meal was sold
for a reasonable price, and we don't
think any one can reasonably com
plain of this part of the fair.
There was plenty. of music. The
Scott, Landry and Thibodeaux
bands discoursed sweet music during
the whole day.
At about six o'clock the guests
made their way toward the train
which was getting ready to leave
If we may judge by the gay faces
of the crowd, they were perfectly
satisfied with their visit to Carencro.
The Gazette congratulates Father
Laforest and the people on the
splendid reception they have ex
tended to their guests. We dare
say that in the future there'will be
no difficult in getting a crowd to
visit Carencro.
The proceeds of the fair, amount
ing to $75o net, will be added to
the church fund.
The Sheriffs.
Sheriff Broussard has received
the following letter which is self-ex
planatory:

Sambo's Weakness for Water
Melons.
Quite an interesting fisticuff took
place Tuesday evening near the
postoffice, with Joe Camara, the
fruit dealer at the corner, and the
notorious young negro named Wil
liam, as principals, and Camara's
wife and Joe Crapo, as accessories
It appears that Williams, who is
always doing some mischief, was
engaged in counter-marking the
water-melons which Camara keeps
for sale. This Camara objected to
and landed his right fist against
Williams' ribs. The two men grap
pled and a hot fight followed.
Some witnesses testified that Cam
ara's wife and his brother in-law,
Joe Crapo, came to his rescue,
while others denied this statement.
The next morning Camara, Crapo
and WVilliatns -appeared before the
mayor, who discharged Crapo,
fined Camtara $2.5o and cost, and
gave the negro $10o.oo or 2o days
on the street.
A Good Showing.
The Gazette compliments its
young friend, Charles DeBaillon,
upon his creditable showing at the
closing exercises and distribution
of premiums of the Jesuits' College
in New Orleans last Monday. His
name figures on the roll of honor
for deportment and application to
study. He has received first prem
iums in English, History, Geogra

Book-keeping he is marked "*dis

superior commercial class next sesa

ladies, and for the ladies. The
gentlemen present were asked to
come, but it was understood that
they were to be silent spectators to

An Answer to Little Hatchet.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
Please allow me space in your valuable
paper to comment on what "Little Hatchet"
said last week, not that I put myself up for a
"right thinking man," for, doubtless,
"Little Hatchet" meant by that, some one
who would pat him on the back. This I
cannot do. In fact I.feel called upon, to
rub him the other way. Now -*Little
Hatchet." will yon please tell us what you
mean by some at your expressions. What
do you mean by 'appreciate the Sunday
law?" If you mean that you want to see
the Sunday law enforced, when it does not
inconvenience you, I think you are correct,
but, If you mean that ymr and all yeor w iigh
eors do want to see the law enforced to the
letter you are wrong for there is scarcely a
Sunday that some of your neighbors do not
come to me to break the law for their con
venience and a large number of them have
spoken in favor of the law being amended
so country stores can sell goods on Sunday.
You do not think that "Mr. Mouton meant
that." Please tell me what you mean by
"that." Is it that Mr. Mouton meant that
"we are better than God" or that the law
should be repealed.
I, "Dull Axe," am strongly in favor of
Mr. Mouton's Sunday law bill, and also of
his school and railroad bills, and, I "tell
you, PNet," he is the right man, .in the
right place, without any "changing up" or
"changig down," and as long as he keeps
the stand he has taken he is sure of the
support of all men who are lovera of justice
and who do not want the Legisature gov
erned by egotism, fanatclm and despotism.
"If these parties who violate the law are
properly put befoie court," but that is inm
possible. If all who have violated the law
were put there, who would be left ? Would
you, Mr. "Little Hatchet."
Because I am not in favor of the Sunday
law you mast not think, I am not in ,favor
of making Sunday a quiet day. I want
every man to worship God according to the
dictates of his own conscience, and I think
it right for every man to respect the feelings
of his neighbor enough to forego making
any unnecessary noaise near a house of wor
ship when service is being held there
whether on Sunday oron mny other day. If I
can worship my God, selling oo buying
cattle of plowing cotton on Sunday, whose
business ilit ? Certainly not yours. That
looks to me to be between mysclf and my
God. I do not cosidiCt myself better than
God, as you intinate: far from it. I have
always lo.,kcd upon man as the last and
