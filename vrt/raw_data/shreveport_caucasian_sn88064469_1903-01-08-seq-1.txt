DR. lEO. W. KENDALL
A Gallant Soldier and Good Citizen Has
Joined the Silent Majority.
Dr. George W. Kendall is dead. This
sad event when announced to his friends
Friday afternoon. January 2. was no
surprise. The information, however,
was received with unfeigned regret, es
pecially by those with whom he was
intimate. He died in his room where he
*ras found by one of his friends who
had missed him on the streets and called
to see him. The door of his room was
ajar. This friend believed him to be
asleep and was shocked when he real
ized that he was lifeless. His repose was
peaceful like one who had drawn the
drapery of his couch about him and
slmumbered to pleasant dreams.
Death was the result of general de
bility. He had long been in feeble
health, flickering as a light from a lamp
in which the oil is exhausted and
which goes out sudd:nliy. At the
time of his demise Dr. Kendall
was about 73 years of age. He was
married and had two daughters, but he
was always reticent over his family af
fairs and over these there must be
drawn a veil through, which no gossip
can pry. His daughters were handsome,
well educated and highly accomplished
young ladies who resided with him until
the fearful epidemic of seventy-three,
when one died and the other was mar
ried and resides in Kentucky.
D.r. Kendall located in Shreveport in
1857. He came from the North, but it
is not known positively in which State
he was born. He frequently alluded to
Kentucky and was intensely Southern
in his sentiments and his feelings. From
1857 to the early sixties he was engaged
in his profession, dentistry, and was the
peer of the best, and on his return homne
from the .historical conflict he resumed
his professin. whih, however, he
graduaily e.linq.ished for real estate,
ind m time beame an authority on ali
miatters of land aid of property and'of
iies He pbished several maps, o,*

MISS HEL2 GOULD.
Everybody's Magazine for January
says: "Miss Juliet Wilbor Tompkins'
character study of Helen Gould is quite
the best analysis of the personality of
this interesting woman yet written.
Miss Gould ascribes tp her father the
inspiration towards that philanthropical
work ~which means so much to the
American people. She is not a senti
mental giver, but orders- her charities
on. a business basis. Two pecretaries and
a typewriter attend to her correspond
ence and she has a representative visit
ing the hospitals seeking worthy cases."
MR. BURROWS BANQUETED.
Friday night Mr. C. E. Burrows,
business manager of the National Trav
elers Protective Association, was ban

THE NEW YEAR.
Turning Over a New Leaf and Good
Resolutions.
With the year 1903 there must be good
resolltions, a turning over of a new leaf,
a beginning of 'improvement in all
things which are to make men and the
world better. It will be conceded that
many of the firm resolves of tomorrow
may not be lasting but a trying with
determination will lead -to success in
a-i.uy shortcomings. "
With the beginning of the new year
we may cling to the pleasant memories
of the past ,to the ideals which now and
then may creep into the heart like sun
beams to cheer and gladden and give
strength .to the hopes for thq future.
Life is a struggle for eternity; each
meets with responsibility, some more
trying and exacting. vexations at times,
and yet the 'fortitude, the patient, the
increasing endeavor, the untiring re
solve to do better is essential to the
climax when the reward, the goal of
hetven is secured.
To each .and all of our readers and
friends we tender best wis s. full meas
ured. pressed down and munning over.
May one and all be attended with good
health and prosperity, the fullest bless
ings of life and prosperity.
If you are particular about yout sta
tionery, we are the people you are look
ing for. We are particular about our
orinting.
