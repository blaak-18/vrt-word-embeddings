long letter, but haven’t the time, but
lam with you to the finish. I quit
Collier’s because it would slur at the
South. I am reading your writings
for the reason that you are of the
South, and for the South, for the
poor and down-trodden. Keep up the
pace. Yours truly,

I’ROM THE ALABAMA HISTORIAN.
My Dear Sir:—Please find $2.00
for renewal of my subscription to
the Weekly and the Magazine Jef
fersonians.
I have been a close observer of
public affairs, public questions and
public men from my youth up. I re
member no political literature of a
riodical character so widely in
structive as your publications. Un
der the circumstances, it has been
my hope, since Appomattox, that the
Southern people would so control
their political course as to allow the
dominant North to divide within it
self. Your writings are well calcu
lated to inspire self-confidence and
self-respect in the South. That end
is the sine qua non of our future, and
it is enough for us.
With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,
J. W. DuBOSE.

A FRIENDLY LITTLE LAD.
Dear Sir:—l have just finished
reading The Jeffersonian, and I
think it is the best paper I have ever
read. lam a country lad, fourteen
years old, and I am in the seventh
grade.
My father and my grandpa can’t
do without your weekly paper. I
have read about as much as any boy
of my age. I have read almost
every book in our school library. I
surely would like to spend a week
with you and your books. I know
you have some good books for boys
to read.
My grandpa is the Clerk of Schley
county Superior Court, and I think
he is the best man in the world. Mr.
Watson, I am writing to you just
because I like you better than any
~ther man I have ever heard of and
haven’t seen. Papa saw you at
Murray’s Cross Roads about sixteen
years ago, speaking for the Third
Party. Your friend,
CECIL BARROW.

A BRILLIANT YOUNG AUTHOR.
Dear Sir: —This is “Thanksgiving
Day”. So, as thanksgivings are in
order (or at least should be —not
only to the Most High, but also to
the low; for God in His written law
lays almost as much stress on the
command, that we be thankful to
each other, as on the one for us to
be thankful to Him Himself), I must
thank you for the check—and espe
cially the words of commendation—
you so kindly sent me in recognition
of my little sketch, “The First Fire
of Autumn,” which appeared in the
November Jeffersonian Magazine.
Hoping that you may be spared
to see many more “Thanksgiving
Days”, and, that on each succeeding
one of them, your Efforts to help
mankind to a better appreciation of
the life they live, of those they live
it among, and of the world they live
it in, may result in you being more
and more indebted to the Great Uni
versal Receiver of thanks; I am de
votedly yours,
WADE CALDWELL.
LEERING WORDS FROM ONE OF
THE PEOPLE.
Dear Sir: —I have read in the
weekly Jeffersonian for November
!th the letter from “Two Loyal Wat
sonians” and the reply thereto.
I think your reply a grand one.
The Atlanta Board’s appeal to you for
a donation was not intended for any.
thing but a hold-up, a plan laid by
the devil to try to injure you. But
ill the devils can do against you can
’ ot keep your work from having a
good effect. They may keep you
from being President of the United
States, but your work will do good
: ir the common people for ages to
come. Just keep on, Brother Wat
son, it does me good to see you hold
’D the scoundrels of this nation and
s 1 ow the common people what they
"re doing. I have been a regular
reader of your literature for a long

issues you take. I have not lan
guage to express my love for you and
the principles you advocate.

HONESTY MAKES A COMMON
GROUND.
My Dear Mr. Watson:—l have had
The Jeffersonian placed on our X
list; and shall be very glad if you
’ll send me your weekly, address
ing it specifically to my individual
me, care Country Gentleman, Al
bany, N. Y. You and I are evidently
much of the same way of thinking
about a good many public affairs,
though I suppose on general princi
ples neither of us would have antici
pated much sympathy between a
Populist and a thoroughgoing Repub
lican. But reasonable, broad-minded
men of the most widely diverse
creeds in politics, civics and religion,
do often find common ground if they
meet calmly face to face and recog
nize that each of them is honestly
seeking the general good and per
fectly willing to learn of the other,
ft is a great satisfaction.
Most sincerely yours,
GILBERT M. TUCKER.

A YOUNG FRIEND WHO IS WORK
ING AND THINKING FOR
HIMSELF.
Dear Sir:—l am herewith sending
you a few subscribers. lam nothing
but a poor boy, working in the cot
ton mill for my living. You can give
me whatever you think it is worth
for getting the subscriptions. I just
felt that Pike count}' and the people
would be benefited if I could get
your good paper in circulation, for
I think it is one of the best papers
I ever read.
I am a Baptist and a Democrat, —
as strong as they make them. I
don’t think people go to Sunday
school or read their Bible much, for
if they did they surely would under
stand the plan of Foreign Missions.
We have been studying the life of
Paul for the last nine months, and
T have not been able to find anything
like the furnishing of free tuition
ISlje □cffersortlan
and board, and all those other things,
to the heathen. I can’t find any
thing that Paul did but preach
Christ.
Very truly yours,

THE UPWARD TRAIL.
Dear Sir: —As I never see anything
in the Jeffersonians from this neck
of the woods I will pen you a few
lines. Realizing the value of space
in the Jeffersonian, I will not make
my letter very long. I feel like it
would help me just to unbosom my
self a little, especially after witness
ing your tussle with the parsons, So
cialists, plutocrats, and the devil gen
erally.
. I have read after and studied you
for twenty years, and I have come
to the conclusion that you are built
like the Irishman’s fence. Let me
tell you about Pat’s fence. He built
it broader than it was tall so that
when it blew over, it would be higher
than it was. So, since the tussle,
they have left you several inches
taller than you were.
Go on upward, blazing the way,
and if you should pass out of our
vision, continue to soar upward until
you reach the highest pinnacle, then
pause a moment in your course, look
back and you will see us Pops follow
ing in your trail. Then, if it be pos
sible that there be more room at the
top, go on up higher and higher until
the perfect day, and may the light of
your example long linger in bless
ings upon those of us who shall
survive to take your place in this
broad and evil world.

NO LAND MONOPOLY IN TEXAS.
Dear Sir:—l am sending clipping
from the Paris Advocate. You will
see what the Progressive Club says
about half the land in this county
not being in cultivation. Our Glen
Rose brother can buy all the land he
wants for $lO per acre and less —can
buy it in this or almost any county
in the State. Os course, land at this
price is not the best, but farmers are
making a good living on these lands
and money besides. This does not
apply altogether to wild lands, but I
can find him good, improved sandy
land at $lO per acre.
Referring to what he said- about
the landlord’s big per cent., there is
not a landowner, few exceptions, that
makes over 10 per cent, by renting
land in this or any other county in
the State. I know whereof I speaik,
because I have many years’ experi
ence, and own some as good farms as
will be found in this or any other
county in the State. I am sending
this that you may know that some
one else lives in Texas and that the
Glen Rose brother overdrew the pic
ture. J. W. B.

TO MY FRIENDS IN THE FARM
ERS’ UNION!
Boys, won’t you see me a fair
fight? Make those Union City would

Make them stop this private-letter
and secret-meeting policy. THEY
ARE DUPING YOU WITH LIES.
MAKE THEM FIGHT FAIR!
THE JEFFERSONIAN COMFORTS
HIM, AND HE THEN COMFORTS
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
Dear Sir: —I am moved to write
you a few lines to let you know how
I am comforted in the way and man
ner in which you have shown up -the
! r>scriptural methods and teachings
of missionary proselytes. Thank you,
Thomas, for the way in which you
have handled that poor blind and ig
norant Republican that believes we
are getting fifteen cents for our cot
ton because Taft was elected Presi
dent. God pity all such deluded
characters.
Thomas, aren’t you sorry for the
officials of the Sugar Trust? Oh,
how Taft, Cannon and Aldrich will
make them repent of their deeds; but
you know they must do something to
appease the wrath of a people that
have been robbed of untold bil
lions for the special benefit of the
Trust magnates or malefactors.
Surely the people will awake
sometime and will fall in line with
us old Pops and help us to overthrow
both old dominated time-serving par
ties of Plutocracy. I am glad that
you intend to give us a sketch of
the iniquities of the Roman Catholic
Church. All of the Protestant
Churches should feel a deep concern
over this matter, for she is that char
acter that St. John pronounced which
was and is not and yet is. She is not
an acknowledged power, but yet she
is a power in the government of
these United States of ours. See
how friendly Taft is toward her.
ore he is to any other.
May God help us all to see that as a
nation we are fast drifting toward
destruction.
Much love to you all.

UNMUZZLED PERIODICALS.
Dear Sir:—lt is very probable that
some of our money-mad fanatics are
ready to say, “Fool, fool, what a
great fool,” when they see a man of
your ability, and capacity to earn
money, taking your stand for the
common herd instead. They don’t
seem to be able to understand it, and
the pity is that all of this class are
not in the big money ranks, either,
—but the greater part belong with
the “common” herd. But there are
a few who understand, and I am
thankful indeed that we still have a
few papers (such as the two Jeffer
sonians) that absolutely refuse to
wear a muzzle, and will attack the
wrong wherever and whenever they
find it, regardless of consequences.
I have talked Watson and the Jef
fersonians so much that some of my
neighbors have jokingly nicknamed
me “Tom Watson,” but if you don’t
care, I am sure I don’t.
Find enclosed P. O. order for three
dollars for the Jeffersonians, as in
dicated on inclosed sheet.
