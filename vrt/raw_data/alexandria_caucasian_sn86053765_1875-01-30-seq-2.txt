Our old friend Capt. Ilijinn, has
again come among us with the
same good humor and kindness
which has ever characterized and
endeared hiiu to our citizens. When
others are to he obliged, the Capt.
seemed always to forget himself
and his presence always recalls to
mind an incident we once witness
ed ou his boat while waiting for
some passengers at the Convent.
The Hodge bad been hailed, and
the Mate supposed the passengers
were on the levee, and when they
were not, began to swear and com
plain, and finally tapped the I>ell
and ordered the plank to be taken
in. The old Captain, in his office
heard the order, and caine to the
front. Just as he asked what was
the matter, the passenger made his
nppearauce, about a quarter of a
mile oft, but running just as pas
sengers would run, who are too
late. With a kiudness th.1t con
trasted strangely to the petulant
impatience of the Mate, the old
Capt. countermanded the order, by
saying Oh ! Charlie ! let us wait for
them. It was kindness to the Mate
and kindness to the hurrying pas
senger, and the recollection of the
incident whenever it has returned
has come like a thousand aud one
of these sweet memories which
makes life pleasant.
Such a man has his heart in the
right place, and will never be
wauting iu the hour of need. His
unwavering attachment to our peo
ple, and his long experience on the
River, deserves their patronage,
and we hope they will give him and
his fine Steamer the patronage they
so richly deserve.
We call attention to his Adver
tisement in another colnmn.
The Bart Able .—This magnificent
side wheel Steanjer with that prince
of Steamboat Captains, Dick Sinnot
on the roof, and with Messrs. Geo.
C. Hamilton, Tom Dowty and our
Rapides boy, Willie French in the
office, has been performing wonders
this trip. She left here late Thurs
day night, got down to the City on
Saturday where she stayed only
seven hours, nnloaded and loaded
and got here with a fine freight at
five o'clock Monday morning. She
went down promptly on Wednesday
with a heavy load of cotton and a
crowd of passengers. This looks
like business and we are glad to see
so fine a steamer and such gentle
manly officers being so well snpport
ed as they certainly deserve to be.
We have put our hand in the
Deck. Our next door neighbor,
Moses, who held three Kings raised
the blind on us and drew another
King. We pass.

Reconstruction in Louisiana a Suc
cess, but a Mure in Georgia, Ala
bama, Virginia, Tennessee and
ArW^gag.
The New Orleans Republican of
the 23d inst., sanctions the bill
about to be introduced into Con
gress, which recognizes the Kellogg
government, but abolishes those ot
the other named States. It says
Louisiana is excepted from the lat
ter because in Louisiana reconstruc
tion has been a success. There
must be, and we presume there is
another exception from failure—
South Carolina. It is not often
that it is onr good fortune to agree
with the Republican, but we do
agrea with it in saying that Recon
struction could not have been ex
pected to have accomplished more
in Louisiana and South Carolina
than it has accomplished. In them
we may learn what the Republican
and the party it represents, regard
as successful Reconstruction and it
is a lesson well worth learning.—
Wo are not familiar enough to
give a detsyl of what Reconstruc
tion has accomplished in South
Carolina, but we propose to give an
outline of its blessings in Louisiana
Gen. Sheridan reports that there
have been 3000 homicides in the
State since 1808; that a very large
proportion of the perpetrators of
these homicides are unpunished,
and that here there is n o seenr
ity of life. As these figures are in
excess of those ot any of the States
iu which Reconstruction is admit
ted to bave tailed, we suppose their
excess to be one of the lruits of suc
cessful reconstruction. We regret
that the General did not continue
his detail of the other items of suc
cess which has made Louisiana an
exception; Of, how many other tel
onies have marked its rule; that
he did not tell the world how ten
der reconstruction has made the
heart and sympathies of our recon
structed Governor for such telouies
as murder, rape, arson, burglary
and larceny; so tender that he par
doned GO at one titne; au act uue
qualed in the annals of philanthro
py. We regret that the General did
not tell that of the 3000 homicides
in Louisiana since 18CS more than
half had been committed by ne
groes upon each other in virtue of
reconstructed District Attorneys,
Jurors, Judges and Sheriffs; that
lie did not tell the world that re
construction could make District
Judges out of men whom the peo
ple of other States thought too ig
norant to bo Justices of the Peace,
and District Attorneys out of re
constructed Attorneys to ignorant
to draw an indictment and too
stupid to conduct a prosecution.—
Lest our readers may think we ex
pected too much of Gen. Sheridan
in so brief a despatch we will con
tinue on our own responsibility an
enumeration of those features of
recDiistructiou which have been
successfully engrafted upon Louis
iana and made her an exception to
the other Southern States to be re
constructed, and we do so the more
readily becanse we intend to enu
merate only those features which
are known and read of all men. We
wish to tell of grand and petit ju
rors made of poor, ignorant ne
groes who canuot be made to com
prehend eveu the forms, much less
the substance of law ; who aanuot
be taught that the offer of a bribe
is an insult, or perjury a disgrace
and a crime, but who are open to
the approaches of every criminal
and in every important case, to use
the gamblers phraseology, the crim
inal goes to the examination before
the grand jury, or to his trial before
the petit juiy, with a cold deck in
his pocket.
Our legislatures have been in
harmonious ignorance and depravi
ty with our Judiciary. Poor ne
groes who could neither read uor
write and who were as ignorant of
honor and integrity as they were of
letters, sat in solemn legislation
to do the bidding ot a few white
men who legislated themselves to
be the legalized robbers of an op
pressed people. One of their first
acts was to subsidize a portiou of
the press which was corrupt enough
to receive their bribes under the
guise of public priutiug which has
«îost from $350,000 to $400,000 per
annum, and whose cost, when done
in English and French, before re
construction, never exceeded $35,
000. It is to be regretted that the
New Orleans Republican, which
has received from $250,000 to $300
000 per annum, of this enormous
expense should with its marked
ability have stooped to except
such a bribe, but it i s not
the first instance in which eminent
abilities have, for filthy lucre pros
tituted themselves, to be the filthy
minions and fiaterer of duty aud
filthy politicians. The printing bill
was the first earnest of reconstruc
tion. Under it the revenues were
doubled and quadrupled by a tax
ation, which resembles confiscation
instead of taxation. The taxes rose
ftom 2J to 21 mills on the dollar,
aud in spite of all this the public
debt in four years, without a single
public improvement, rose from $3-,
000,000 to 30,000,000. The only
thing that went, down was the
credit of the State which fell from
par to 40 and at last to 25 cents on
the dollar. Agriculture aud com
merce have continued to decay
until they are well nigh extinct.-
The poor negro for whom recon
struction pretends to have been
made has and is beaiing the heav
iest portions of this misrule. His
increasing poverty has kept pace
with this public decay, until his
rags and want and poverty have
become truly pitiable. Amidst all
this ruin one class alone has pros
pered; the legislators, office holders
aud the monopolists to whom they
have sold all that constitutes liber
ty. Legislators have grown sud
denly rich, paradiug for sale on the
streets of New Oi leans their
Slaughter House stock, their Lot
tery stock, their Levee stock, their
Chattanooga Rail Road stock, their
Sugar Shed stock ; the filthy bribes
for which they had sold the Com
merce and enterprise of the State.
One sessioivaloue of one of these
reconstructed legislatures cost the
enormous sum of $950,000, and of
another, the mines of 30 or 40
members who had received $50,000
for passing a single bill with their
receipt was published in the pub
lic prints.
Like ourselves we presume our
readers will by this time have
grown tired of this sickening detail
Of its truth, the statutes and journ
als of these legislatures furnish
«abundant evidence and we have
given it to show what constitues
successful reconstruction in Louis
iana and why she is to be made au
exceptiou to the other Southern
States.
Our young aud enterprising
friends at the corner, Messrs. Fer
guson & Schnack, have placed up
on our desk as a sample, two bot
tles of Hoyts Cologne, and while it
first reminded us of their continued
kindness it formally reminded us of
the importance of odors. There is
nothing like sweet odors as the
flowers and the ladies can testify,
and if our young men who have de
signs at the next ball or at some of
the sweet evening tete-a-tetes, they
cannot do a more sensible thing
than to give our friends a call. It
is useless to remind the ladies of the
importance of such a call, they
know more about it than we do.
Sweet odors is not the only thing
that one may find on a visit to our
friends ; they can get "time" on
the most reasonable terms, a com
modity which the world sometimes
lacks wealth enough to buy. Nor
is this all, dim eyes can there find
bright-eyed spectacles, and good
taste behold many of the beauties
and marvels of refined art.
A visit there will teach more
than some schoolmasters learn their
pupils in a year. Go, and be wise !
C5P Grant has sent a special mes
sage to Congress informing them
that he has discovered a new Jewel
and that Sam Fellows is the Proprie
tor. Sam got an advance copy of
the message with an order to gend
ten gallons of his best by pony ex
press to Grant himself.
From a notice elsewhere it
will be seen that the Stenmer Semi
nole, Capt. J. C. Mitchell, will carry
cotton from this point at One Dollak
per bale.
Ought Church Property to be Exempt
from Taxation ?
The Rapides Gazette of the 24th
inst., reads its patrons a long hom
ily on this subject, in which it stren
uously urges the injustice of such
an exemption. We are delighted
that no such article ever appeared
in any Southern Democratic paper.
If it had, it would have been at
once copied throughout the North
and perhaps might have found its
way to Europe as incontrovertible
evidence that Southerners were
heathens, that the Temples of
God should pay tribute to Cresar.
That his worship should be taxed
That these temples where the mem
ories and associations of all that is
sweet and holy in life here, and the
life to come; are clustered, should
be profaned by the foot of the tax
gatherer! That these temples
reared by the free will offering of
the generous, the pious and the
good and consecrated to the incul
cation of justice, and truth, and
mercy, and forgiveness, and gentle
ness, and forbearance and kindness
and'meekuess, and charity, should
be laid under tribute ! That these
household gods of the christian
should be torn from their sanctua
ries ami be scattered and broken by
the political misers grasp for gold !
To us the article in the Gazette is
the profanity of infidelity and ir
reverence and might well have pro
ceeded the times which ushered iu
the worship of the goddess of rea
son. As the goddess of reason was
the climax of the French revolu
tion, so the taxation of churches
and church yards would be a fitting
capstone to the misrule of Radical
ism iu Louisiana. It has, under the
pretext of taxation rifled and plun
dered every thing except the chur
ches and their churchyards, anil it
would be most fit that the closing
scenes of its sad drama should be
its tax-gatherers rifling the sanctu
aries of God aud the graves of the
dead of their church yards.
TEBPSICHOHE.
Terpsichore was the goddess of
the Mazey dance; one of those
beautiful miths of the Ancients
which has given to one of the forms
of fleeting pleasure, a habitation
and a name. In spite of this ortho
dox age, this goddess lias survived
the thousands who once wandered
with her over the fields of Elisum,
and has consented to preside over
the Ball of the Stonewall Hookk &
Ladder Co., at the Exchange Hall,
on next Monday night. Those who
wish to see her light fantastic
step, or those who love to beat
time to the melody of music anil
chase fleeting pleasure on the fleet
iug moment will find the gallant
boys of the I look and Ladder ready
to join with them in the happy
chase. Once a year ! The gallant
fellows who have stood gard over
our homes and fire sides for twelve
long months, made us feel safer
aud sleep sounder because we knew
they were on guard, deserve our
best wishes. We wish that each
fleeting moment on Monday night
may come loaded with pleasure
aud linger long and they may re
ceive its fullest aud richest reward
for their faithful duty.
The River .—We see from the
Shreveport Times of the 21st., that
the river at that point foil two inches
during the 21 hours ending at 3
(o'clock the day previous, and that the
Jefferson Jimplecute reported the
Bayou falling slowly, with five feet
above the lowest water. Since the
date of the Times we have had one of
the heaviest rains that we have had
for mouths, and gentle rains almost
every day. The river at this point is
rising rapidly, and if as muoh rain
has fallen for any great distance
norih of us, we will have a very full
river before the present rise ends,—
At present the river ia nearly half
bank full ; as much water as the lar
gest size steamers can want and as
much as we would ever have, if we
had our own way about it.
|3P The Carnival Association of
New Orleans have resolved to make
no display this year and there will
be no Mardi Gras festival. The dis
turbed condition of affuirs is the
cause.
I
Pneumonia.
The Shreveport Timet, of the
21st inst., says that this disease is
very prevalent in that city and its
vicinity; the effect of the recent
very cold weather. There is no
doubt that Pneumonitis in many
instances produced by breathing
cold air, which produces inflamma
tion of the lungs iu the same man
ner that a poultice of Ice would
produce inflammation on the skin
if applied for a sufficient length of
time. We mention the cause, be
cause it points out a precaution
which persons with weak lungs
should never omit. No amount of
clothing can keep cold air out ot the
lungs, but a good fire in the bed
room at night, will furnish even
the man of out-door life, with warm
and wholesome air for half his time,
and will be found a great security
against this tearful disease.
If wo were not fearful of ventur
ing too far out at Sea, we would
suggest that the cause points to an
other preventive, namely: that
during these sudden and intensely
cold spells, persons in out-door life
should use a diet rich in carbon
so as to furnish the lungs with fuel,
and keep its ever burning furnace
at its average temperature.
t3P According to the La. State
Register , there can be very little
difference between Sypher, of La.,
and Cypher in the mathematical
equation of nothing, from nothing;
and nothing remains. But hear
how the Register , works out its 8y
plier equatiou :
"Anil now comes "Sypher of Lou
isiana" who gets up in Congress to
defend his vote for the Pacific Mail
Subsidy, and ''denies indignantly"
that he ever received anything for
his vote. Sypher is telling the
truth. There never was a Con
gressional lobbyist that cunsldered
Sypher or his mflueuce worth a
cent, aud if any man had given bim
anything, the fool-killer would have
had that man in ten minutes.—
There is no use in Sypher's ''iudig
iiatiou."'
The Seminole .—Capt. Mitchel and
that obliging gentlemen Jas.JKobins,
are making regular weekly trips with
tlieir splendid boat, the Seminole
and the freight and passengers she
carries both ways is the sure index
of her popularity. No nicer boat or
more pleasant officers are to be found
anywhere than is found in the Semi
nole and her officers. We are proud
to observe onr friend, Mr. J. Comp
ton French, in the office and doubt
not that he will form a valuable ac
quisition to the Seminole.
CF We regret to learn tbat Re*.
Christopher Hunt, who has filled the
position of Pastor to the^ Colored
Methodist Church here so acceptably
to his congregation and to the whit e
people, for some years has been re
moved by their Conference and is to
be stationed in New Orleans. Mr.
Hunt was Conservative and did not
believe in making his church a politi
cal engine of bate to the white peo
ple and we shall regret his departure
very much. We wish him success in
his new field of labor.
E^The Bart Able on Monday
brought np an officer with sum
mons' for several of our citizens to
appear before the Congressional Com
mittee. Among the number we
observe that Col. Wise, Mr. E" B.

Carter Carr, Stephen White and
Labeous Kennedy colored Conserva

XB. ITA1T 8.
We elip the following deseription
of this distinguished gentleman from
the New York Sun, whieh we have no
doubt will be perused with pleasure
by our readers. Mr. Evarts' reputa
tion is national. He was the leading
counsel of President Johnson on his
impeachment trial and made some al
lusions to spoons and being bottled
up, whieh would have been very .nit
pleasant to anybody else, exoeptGen.
B. F. Butler, but one had as well
piteh broom-straws atthe htf§ of a
rhinoceros as sarcasm at that distin
guished military ehieftain.
Mr. Evarts at prenant is the lead
ing counsel of Mr. Bsecher/ii the
great Scandal Suit, and if rumor be
true will be yet more distmgniahed
by his defense and championship tqr
constitutional liberty on the trial of
the case of the Colfax prisoners in'
the Supreme Court of the United
States? *
The senior counsel for Mr. Berniter,
Mr Evarts, with the fame of connec
tion with national litigation and policy,
is seemingly the muet self-conscious
lawyer in the two groupa. On atmnt
every day in the first week ot the trial
he demands more room. When the
tables had at last been arranged ac
cording to hia plan .lie still frowned,
and looked as tlN>ogh'he wanted to nut
everybody at a yet more respectful dis
tance. lie is old, Uli», staiglit, and
lias such a face as would wrvuch the

his chin. Hi* bead is shapely, bat not
large, fie wears ho beard, and Iii»
hair is dark and rather short. Hi s
clothes will be shabby before long if
doesn't get a new suit. To snm np
his appearance to his own incisive sort
of langnage, he is half way between a
wixen-fMced, mosty old gentlemen and
one of the fine, precise, yellow veteran»

the outcome of any sonnil. It is liko
watching a wood chopper from a dis
tance, and seeing the nxo fall, tlio
the sonnd of the stroke coming an
