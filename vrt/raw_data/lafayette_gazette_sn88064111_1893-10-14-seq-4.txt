SACRED CAtTTL FROM INDIA.
The crowd that pours out of the city
toward Jackson park through the vari
ous channels of travel is daily increas
ing and the facilities for transportation
are being severely taxed. Street cars,
"L" trains, railway trains, lake boats
and all means of transit are kept busily
on the move to take care of the hurry
ing throngs that surge toward the
gates of the White City, but there is as
yet very little inconvenience felt by
the traveling public. and, although a
much larger crowd is expocted from
now on to the close of the fair, it is
thought there will be but little difficul
ty in providing for them all.

A OERMIAN BEAUTY.
Just now the main attractions at the
fair in the shape of special features iare
the West Point cadets and the prize
cattle and horses. Widely varying in in
terest, of course, are these two features,
but attention- is pretty evenly divided
between them.. There is more fine
stock at the fair just at present than
was ever before gotten together, and
more countries are represented in this
department than were ever placed in
competition before in America.
Among the exhibits in the live stock
department are some which are decided
ly unusual in such exhibitions. There 1
are some Brahmin, or sacred cattle,
from India, which, according to the I
legends of that country, were at one
time worshiped as are the white ele- I
phants of Siamn. They were, it is said, 1
stalled in Buddhist temples and were =
fed from vessels of gold and silver. 1
Whatever sacred character they once i
possessed, the India cattle are now 1
bred for combined speed and draft pur- I
poses. The two specimens, bull four I
years old and cow two years old, on ex- I
hibition at the fair, are from Trinidad,
one of the windward islands of the 1
Caribbean sea, just off the coast of Brit- i
ish Guiana. The island is a British I
colony, and the India bull and cow a
were bred from sires and cows import- i
ed over twelve years ago from Hindo- r
stan. The breeding on the island has r
been eminently successful under gov- s
ernment auspices. and the cattle make v
fast draft animals. They are speedier a
than mules, and will draw twice the
weight. It is no unusual thing to see a
these animals hitched up to larriages t
and handsome barouches in Trinidad, q
and the India bull is a natural and fast ii
trotter. v
The cow at- the fair is a creamy
white animal, delicately limbed as a
Jersey cow, and somewhat resembles
one, only being larger. The bull is
mouse-coiored, marked black about the Ii
muzzle, and is a strong, vigorous-look
ing animal. Both are short-horned, iý
ave 4ruonopg ear, sad h ae4IttIugtive ia
Amiericas bisoc 'aiI
nmale are thin-alinned , sh ort
haired, an4 eir costs glisten like

Among other importations are forty
head of horses from Russia. Including
a number from the imperial stables.
These animals are noted for their
speed and endurance and will be dis
posed of in this country for breeding
purposes.
The diplay of native stock is very
complete and extensive. There are a
great many very fine specimens of
horseflesh, from the ma joth Perch.

DUTCH BELTED CATTLE.
Numerous cattle of repute are also
stalled in the great stock exhibit.
Dairy cows with pedigrees and records
as long as their tails, and valued at
sums that would be a life-long com
petence for the average man, ruminate
complacently while the admiring
crowds feast their eyes upon them.
The prizes are going off rapidly and
the daily contests are proving great at
tractions, and are fillinge the great
y I pavilion in the southern portion of the
i- grounds.
- It is very probable that lovers of
a thoroughbred horseflesh will soon have
i, an opportunity of seeing the greatest
s of all living equines, for which
y $130,000 was paid less than a year ago.
- Negotiations are now pending between
ce Mr. Mills, superintendent of the live
s stock exhibit at the world's fair,
y and Villiam O'Hrien McDonough, the
I young California millionaire, for a two
s weeks' exhibition of the great English
a stallion and unbeaten thoroughbred.
- Ormonde. The horse was formerly the
property of the duke of Westminster
and was sold by him to a South A meri
can for 5860,000. The perfection of the
animal in conformation, his unbeaten
record of sixteen races, defeating the
greatest runners in all Europe, and his
great success as a sire-Orme and St.
Gatlon, his sons, being two of the
champions of the English turf-make
Shim by far one of the greatest thorough
breds that ever looked through a bridle.
A week ago Ormonde arrived in New
York from England and will soon be
en route to the great stock farm of his
new owner in California. It is expect
ed that the animal will be allowed to
step over a couple of weeks and show
his great self in the stock pavilion.
OCCIDENTAL ODDITIES.
Queer Notions as to What Was Wanted
at the Worltd's Fair.
Queer.ideas sometimes get afloat and
drift around among the people for
years. For example, a belief prevails
among a number of persons here in
Spokane that the government, or the
state, or the city, or some modern
Monte Cristo has a standing offer of
five hundred dollars to anyone who will
go over the falls in a barrel. Down in
Oregon a belief long prevailed in some
minds that the government would pay
one hundred dollars to the person who
would plant an American flag on
Mount Hood. A number made the as
cent and ran up the stars and stripes,
but a cold and unpatriotic government
invariably failed to respond with the
gold coin so severely earned.
By some incident or accident an im
pression got extant in this state that
the Washington world's fair commis
sion was seeking native-born triplets
to exhibit at the Columbian exposition,
and as a result the commission received
many letters of inquiry, a number of
them saying that they could not pro
vide triplets, but if twins were wanted
the demand could be quickly met.
Still others became deluded with the
belief that the commission was seeking
far and wide for a badger. Letters on
file with the commission indicate that
a good many people thought the Wash
ington exhibit was to partake of the
nature of a dime museum. It is stir
prising, though, how anyone could
seriously imagine that the commission
would make use of an animal so com
mon as the badger. The members are
"badgered"' enough even as matters
stand. There are many queer things in
the realm of nature, but there are
queerer things in the realm of thb ,
imagination. - Spokane (Wash.) lie

lsh The work represented in the remaining
'oy portions of the two sections shois the
'n- system of education of the convents and
led academies by grades, from the first
ak step to the graduating course. There
are compositions in English, French,
German and Spanish by pupils of the
various schools, and some of these are
illustrated with pen drawings by the
student, the subject being told in a
two-fold manner. Great albums con
itain samples of needlework from the
simplest bit to the finest crochet and
lacework. The name of each worker
and her age-are appended to the article.
The ages range from eight to sixteen
years and some of the work is remark
able. In one exhibit work is shown in
I flax, from the preparation of it on
through its several stages, the last be
ing a woven article. This is done by
the students of Ursaline convent, Rob
ertvue, Lake St. John. The work of
the blind in the asylum at Montreal,
under thodirectionof the Gray Nans, Is
but another revelation of the ability of
the blind. One sample will illustrate:

by the deaf mutes of Montreal are in

thousand pressed flowers, each an-I
alyzed, all from the soil of Canada. The I
exhibit, as a whole, is varied and many
things there are curious, and all are
creditable to the system of education in
the old province.
PLAYING WORLD'S FAIR.
That Is a New Game and the Children
Save Lots of Fun with It..
"Playing world's fair" is now a favor
ite amusement of the smaller boys and
girls of Chicago. Many of them have
seen for themselves the beauties of the
exposition, including the bizarre glo
ries of the Midway Plaisance. All these 1
things the little ones try to reproduce
in woodsheds and attics and under
back porches. Toys and pictures and
lanterns and anything else that can be
made to simulate some feature of the
exposition is set up in the "fair" and an
an admission fee varying from five pins
to one cent is collected from neighbor
ing "kids" who are not favored with
full-term passes by the directors.
A Vest side mother recently observed
great agitation among her little flock
and on inquiry was told they had a
world's fair in the basement, and that
she "might come in for a cent." She
paid no more attention to the matter
e till in the afternoon her little boy, aged
seven, ran in with g wing cheeks and
f told her to come quick and see their
Midway, and that Jennie and Millie
a neighbor's little girls-were dancing
like the Persians at the fair. There
was enough in this to alarm the young
nmatron, and, apparently responsive to
cthe boy's urgent invitation, she permit
ted herself to be led to the basement,
where she was horrified at what she
saw. .TcJennie and Millie, little tots of li
Sin
1 about six years of age, were perched on a
a dry-goods box doing duty as a stage, pi
and, clad only in single garments, were re
r going through moiions that would
have been most shocking in their sug- th
gestive depravity were it not for the cf
baby innocence of the performers. A g'
most enthusiastic audience of about c
their own age applauded the tiny pc
dancers, all equally ignorant and inno"
cent. Without provoking inquiry as to Hi
why she did it, the mother managed to
stop the "dance" and to obtain from h
the children a promise that they wvould ia
not repeat it. Cautious questioning'
developed the fact that a large boy who
lived in the neighborhood and who had
seen the Midway dances had told the be
little fellows who were getting up thd to
play fair that the Midway was the best tic
part of the exposition, and had told ap
them how to reproduce the scenes and we
had taught the little girls how to imi- St
