calm. That is why I hate opals-one
did that for a friend of mine."
The young offeicer laughed gently.
"Fancy will do much-for a woman,"
he said.
"If you are going to laugh and fling
at our sex, I have done!" said Miss
Merton. "I can find better amusement
than being laughed at, in the ball
room."
"1 beg your pardon. I will be very
good," he" answered, contritely.
For a few moments they walked on
silently, until they were at the furthest
n-- td ol the piazza. Then Miss Merton
began her story. Her voice was low
and musical, and at first Lieut. Phelps
-who had long.been beyond the sound
of, any woman's voice whatever-was
content simply to listen to its smooth
flow. But she had only spoken a few
fvords before he began to find her story
of absorbing interest,
"This opal," said Miss Merton, "was
given by a than to the woman whom
he said he loved. The man believed in
the evil power of the stone. Now, sir,
you may laugh and have your fling at
us. lie was afraid of it, but she was
not. When he told her to choose, she
asked for that, and he gave it to her,
with many a caution. 'If any harm
comes to it, harm will come to us,' he
told her. 'You must never let it be
upon the handof another. for then that
one will come between us.'
"She promised, of-course; but she was
young and careless, 'nd did not much
believe in looking at the serious side of
- life when there was a brighter and bet
ter one to see.
"The stone was very beautiful. In its
depths it held all the glowing colors of
the furnace. It was changeable as the
chameleon. It fascinated me when I
looked at it, but frightened me because
it was so inconstant. As I told you, my
friend was young. She had not yet
learned how very serious a matter life
is. The ring kept other men away
from, her, curtailed her pleasures, her
freedom."
SHer companion begau some protest,
but Miss Merton stopped him.
"Yes; I know what you are going to
say--that she should have reckoned
upon that--that she would not have
caredlf ashe retally loved him. But you
.funnot change the nature of a girl in a
? day. She found that the ring narrowed
heoilife, and so one day she put it
away."

(Miss Merton's voice grew very soft)
'you won't come between us. will you,
sweetheart?' she added, kissing me."
Miss-Merton paused, and they both
stood silent and looked out npon the
sea, bathed in its glory of moonlight, .
for a long time. The lady stole a
glance at the man's face, to see if he 1
took any interest in her story. But it1
told no more than the great hotel in
whose shadow they stood.
When she resumed her voice had
lost its mellow sweetness, and had c
taken instead a hard worldliness that
grated on his ear like music out of
tune. c
"I did not mean to be false to her. I
should not be telling you this now if I
could not say that honestly. But when
she gave me the opal she tempted me.
She said: 'See how it glows, Helen, 1
like fire. I think he is like that. If I
am not careful I will get singed in the
flame.'
"I had never been without men
about me. but they were little men.
There wasno fire in them,and I thought
I should at least like to play with the
flame-although I knew it burned for
another.
"That evening I wore the ring, and
Harry Germain saw it ond my hand. I
told him whose it was and why I
wore it.
S"This is capital,' he said. 'Let me
wear it, and it will serve its purpose
better still. If he sees me have it, he
will be insanely jealous.' I hesitated
but a moment, and gave it to him."
Perhaps it was because Lieut. Phelps
was absent-minded, but for some
reason he dropped the hand that had
been resting on his arm, and leaned
against one of the pillars of the piazza.
"I knew," continued Miss Merton,
"that if he were jealous, the flame
would be easily kindled for me to play I
with; but I did not think of what might
follow. He saw the ring, and went at
once to Agnes.
'"'You have given the ring to Harry
Germain!' he said. She was frightened
at his brusqueness, and faltered in her
speech. 'Oh! don't trouble to deny it,'
he said: 'I have just seen iton his hand.
I thought there was some one between
us. I know it now.' Then, without
another word, he turned away from
her. Her first impulse was to follow
him-to call out, to cry to him that it
was all a mistake. But then her pride
revolted, and when Harry Germain
came up and asked her to dance, she
went off with himn, laughing as bright
ly as she ever had. And he saw them
together, and saw that Germain still
wore his ring."
"And you?" queried the lieutenant.
"I hope you won that for which you
played?" His tone was icily courteous,
but he looked out to sea instead of to
ward his companion.
"lie went away that night," she re
plied. "I never saw him againa
day."
Again they stood silent, and looked
at the sea and the sky, but not at each
other. l'reseitly the man spoke.
"Where is she now?"
"In the ballroom, by this time. She
said she should come down later."
"Did she know that you were going
to tell me this?"
He turned and left her without a
word-walked rapidly down the long
piazza, and she saw him disappear
within one of the low windows. Then
she sighed wearily.
"I only told him half the truth," she
said. "I wonder if it would have been
better to have told him all? She can
never care for him as I do."
The lieutenant stopped to give one'
swift glance about, then walked
straight across the polished floor. In
front of Agnes Wilton he stopped
again, and looked at her quietly a mo
ment before he spoke. In that mo
ment he had time to see that an opal
glowed like a coal of living fire upon
her hand.
She looked up and met his glance
steadily, but she was very pale.
"There is a legend," he said, bending
toward her, "that if the love that gave
it grows cold, the opal's fire will grow
dim. Do you believe it?"
"Yes," she answered, so low that he,
could just hear the words; "but mine
never has grown dim. Its fire has'

warmed me through all the long years
I--oh! so long," she said, "each one
longer than the other. But I knew
you would come--the opal told me."
A little later some one said:
"Why, there is Jack Phelps dancing
with Agnes Wiltonl They quarreled
desperately three years ago and she
sent him away. But he is back, like a
i moth to the candle."
m "The candle," said another. "is that
I magnificent opal ring that she wears.
m Jack gave it to her, and it has never
m left her hand since he went away."
a "Nevertheless," said Miss Merton, to
I whom the conversation was half ad
I dressed, "the opal is a stone of evil
t omen. I would not wear one for the
t world."' Ani although the night was
a warm, she shivered again.

KNEW THEY HAD ENOUGH.
Two Men Who Did Not Demamd .ea.tae- I
tlon.
A tall, thin young man and a short,
stocky one walked painfully up Main '
street yesterday afternoon. They were C
t well-dressed. From the rear they
looked like two young fellows whohad -
tight shoes or sore feet or something
of the kind. From the front they looked
like two men who had been thrashed
within six inches of their lives by some
one who knew how to use his fists.
That is what they were.
The tall, thin man had one black
eye. There was a long bruise on the
side of his face and his nose was twisted'
somewhat. One of his lips was cut.
The short, stocky man had two black I
eyes. His forehead had the skin rub
bed off and his lips were cut.
"Hello!" said a friend, "what in I
thunder's the matter with you fellows?" I
"Oh," said the tall young man, i
"we've been licked."
"That's right," said the stocky young 4
man.
"How'd it happen?" inquired the!
friend.
"WVe got fresh and got licked. That's 3
I all there is to it."
- "That's enough, ain't it?" asked the
stocky young man."
"One man or two?" inquired the "
friend.
- "Oh." answered the tall young man.
"It wee one man. lie didn't have much 1
i trouble."
"But what are you going to do about 1
it?"
"Why," said the stocky young man,
i "we're going to bed."
1 "But what are you going to do about
the fight?"'
"Going to bed I told you."
"Aren't you going to report it to the
police?"
t "Police?" queried the tall young
t man. "Report what to the police?"
"Why, the fact that you have been
outrageously treated by some one."
S"WVhat have the police got to do with
r it?"
"They could arrest the man who as
saulted you, couldn't they?"
"Now, see here," broke in the stocky
t young man, "I told you that we got
a licked. We did. I told you that one
man did it. lie did. I told you that,
t we were going to bed. Vce are. • I
e don't see that you have any kick com
ing in this matter. We're satisfied,
ain't we, Nelse?"
"Perfectly," said the tall young man,
a with a sickly sort of a smile. "I'mn
.1 dead lucky that I didn't get two black
eyes, and the fellow might have gouged
out one of Jimmy's. Oh. you bet we're
u satisfied."
• And the stocky young man wiped
. sone blood off his forehead, and the
two started up the street again. -Buf

One Thilng a Proofreader Ca'n Do.
N*ative Patagonians, like other say
h age people, have very keen eyes for
certain things-things which their
modes of life have made it indispensa
e ble that they should notice. In other
words, they are specialists, and as a
matter of course they excel in their
own particular line. linut it does not
follow that they have better eyes than
a are possessed by men of civilized coun
tries. Set one of them to find a re
rversed "s" in the middle of a printed
page, says NIr. Hudson, and the tears
would run cdown his brown cheeks, and
She would give up the search with ach

ments and never strain his eyes in the
e least.-Youth's Companion.
d Carlyle's Temper.
n It is easier to say why a particular
d: man should be a pessimist than why a
great many should be. In Carlyle it is
tolerably clear that early surroundings
Li and facts of temperament had a good
n deal to do with the settled gloom of his
speculations. Calvinism trains strong
e ment but can hardly be said to predis
pose to cheerfulness. This particular
g man of genius had constitutional ail
e ments, and his life was for a long time
v a struggle with poverty, and he grew
up in a very dismal period-the time
e. when the great war had left us over
e strained and' disenchanted, the later
s time when reform seemed to be un
profitable, and the days of famine that
forced free trade upon the country.

NO WPNDER WOMEN ARE VAIN.
[ is Caultvated by Their Mothers ftrom A
Earliest Cldhlbood.
Women generally are credited with a
wonderful amount of vanity in their d
composition. And yet when one takes a
into consideration the fact that this
characteristic is instilled into their 1
natures from the time of their earliest u
childhood the wonder is that they are y
not absolutely unbearable. Mothers a
naturally delight in having their little r
ones dressed well, and among the first 11
impressions that a child receives is the E
attention that good clothes demand a
and the amount of time and Jabor that
are expended upon them. i
Even tiny babies realize when they
are dressed up, and as time goes on the
love of finery grows with their growth, c
and their daily actions and thoughts i
are influenced largely by it. Playmates 1
and classmates who dress well are se
lected in preference to those whose gar- 3
ments are not cut in the latest style or
of the finest material.
More tears are shed because of the u
inability to secure new bits of finery %
than are ever caused by rebukes or de- a
nials of any sort. Clothes are made
the feature in a little girl's life that
dominates all other attributes, and i
when the child grows to be a woman
people condemn her for being vain and
frivolous when in reality she is but
living up to the earliest ideas that have
been. sown in the budding mind. 1
If parents do not wish their daugh- 1
ters to be called vain and silly they
should at the beginning imbue them
with ideas that are not teeming with
the impressions of self-adornment.
Teach them that life has other aims 1
and better work, that the noblest na
tures dwell in the plainest tenements, I
and that though it is one's duty to look
as well as possible it becomes a sin
when every thought is given to the
beautifying of the person at the sacri
fice of other motives that tend to the
accomplishment of a more gracious
purpose.-Philadelphia Times.
HAVEN FOR CRIMINALS.
Places in Various Countries Where Justice
C'an He Evaded.
In Scotland there still exists a sanc
tuary for debtors in the abbey and pal
ace of Holyrood, with its precincts.
The sanctuary is placed under the con
trol of a bailie, appointed by the duke
of Hamilton.
When the debtor retires to the sanc
tuary he has twenty-four hours protec
tion, but in order to extend the privilege
longer he must be enrolled on the
books of the abbey. The sanctuary
affords no protection to a criminal or
fraudulent debtor, or to a crown debtor.
Another sanctuary exists in Hlawaii,
called-the Rock of Refuge. If a crimi
nal reach the refuge before he can be
captured, he is safe as long as he re
mains there. His family can and usu
ally do supply him with food until he
is able to make his escape, but he is
never allowed to return to his own
tribe.
In China the Buddhist religion al
lows men to beco se priests at an ad
vanced period of life for the purpose of
escaping from impending justice. In
some instances Buddhist temples are
regarded as inviolable sanctuaries for
transgressors of the law.
Formerly there were many sanctua
ries in England, just as the cities of
refuge were appointed by the laws of
Moses for one who had killed another
intentionally, to prevent the relations
of the slain taking the law into their
own hands, as the Arabs still do in
such cases. -Boston Globe.
Ancestry of Literary Geniuses.
Swinburne is a descendant of Celtic
and Scandinavian stock. Tennyson
seems to have been equally of Danish
I extraction and Plantagenet ancestry,
s with a slight mixture of French blood.
William Morris is a descendant of
- Welsh and Anglo-Danish stock. Robert
r Browning's great-grandfather, who
was of Welsh-Saxon origin, married a
Creole, while the poet's mother was of
German and Scotch parentage. Ros
setti was twenty-five per cent. En
glish and northern blood mingled
r with his Italian ancestry. The com
- mingling of races in the literary
t geniuses of France is more remarka
ble still. The grandmothexr of the
senior Dumas was a black woman of
St. Domingo. Flaubert had Iroquois
blood in his veins. The father of Vic
tor iHugo came of the Germnans of Lor
raine. Greek, French and Italian
blood exists in Zola; his father was a n
a Italian mathematician. Ibsen is of
German and Scandinavian ancestry,
intermixed with Scotch.-Philadelphia

SHE DECIDED TO LIV.
Adad Si Months After She Dida't Regret
It In the Least. g
"It is always darkest before the Li
dawn," is a saying aptly illustrated by I
an anecdote given by Hume Nisbet, in
"A Colonial Tramp." While in Mel- y
bourne IMr. Nisbet one evening stepped n
under a veranda to avoid a shower. A t1
young woman was there before him, b
and from her harassed face and her
restless pacing up and down he judged t]
her to be in trouble. So it proved. ti
Suddenly the woman approached him t
and said: J
"Would you mind doing me a favor,
sir?"
'-No. 'That is, if I can. WVhat is it?'" f
"I want some medicine from the p
chemist over there, but he will not give ih
it to me: perhaps he would let you
have it." c1
"Perhaps. What kind of medicine do
you want?" p
"A shilling's worth of laudanum." 4
"I'll try," I said, and taking the sl
money from her was about starting off
when a thought occurred to me, and I
asked: I
"What do you want it for, miss?" 14
"Toothache. I have it frightfully to- v
night." a
"No, you haven't," I said, quietly.
"It is hea.rtache that ails you, and you t
want to kill yoursel?."
"You are right," she said: "I do want 1
to kill myself. Now, suppose, you will t
be for giving me up." it
"No. I would rather help you die if
you are quite sure that you are done
with life. But are you sure?"
Then she told me she was a tailoress, 4
but most of the trade was in -the hands a
of the Jews, and they would not em- t
ploy her, and she could not get work
elsewhere. She had tried every shop S
in Melbourne. t
"Then I'll get you laudanum," said a
I; "only I want a favor fromyou first." i
"What is it?" 9
"I want you to live until to-morrow 1
night, and try all round once more. If
you fail of success meet me here to
morrow at this hour, and I'll do my
best to get you the laudanum."
She agreed to that and 'I returned d
the shilling. Next night I waited in l
vain for the young woman to appear. r
Six months afterward I was waiting t
at the post office for letters when a t
pretty, laughing-faced young woman'(
came up the steps with a young man
beside her. As soon as she saw me she 1
darted forward and shook me warmly
by the hand. It was the young woman
who had wanted the laudanum. ]
"I got a job the next day," she said, I
"so I did not need to corqe to you. Bet
ter still. I got a husband. I say. dear,"
she cried to her companion, who had
joined us, "this is the young man who
made me go the rounds again."
Then turning again to me she said: r
"This is my husband. I got a place 1
after all, and he was the foreman there.
.We have been married two months.
I'mn very happy," and she laughed in a
pleasant manner.-Chicago JournaL 1

-Arabia is a country that. notwith
standing its sacred associations, has i
been sadly neglected 3by the mod
ern missionary churches. Organized
missionary work was begun by ion
Keith Falconer, of the Free Church of
Scotland, in 1885 The American mis
sion was organized five years later.
Its headquarters are at Busrah, and it
has three ordained missionaries, with
three native helpers. Altogether,
among the million of Arabians, there
are only seven missionaries and four
native helpers. These people are
rightly called the Anglo Saxons of the
orient, and in themselves, quite aside
from the history of their country, are
well worth winning.

THE WAY TO SIT.
Our Orandmother's Stralght-Back Style is
e the Best One.
When our grandmothers were girls
and straight-backed chairs instead of
t cushioned divans were the usual rest
ing places, the young women held
themselves with a straightness that
it was almost stiffness. Then when
they grew old they still held them
t selves like duchesses. For it is the
way one sits rather than the exercises
I one takes that determines the erect
ness of the figure.
A prominent physician says that the
proper sitting position requires that
the spine shall be kept straight and
- that the support needed for the upper
part shall be felt in the .right place.
, Therefore it is necessary to sit as far
a back in the chair as possible,so that the
- lower end of the spine shall be braced
o against the back of the seat.
g If this back is straight the shoulders
- will also rest against it; but even if the
s shoulders have no point of support, it
will be found that they do not need it
when the base of the spine is sunported
a properly. This position makes no strain
- upon the ligaments of the spine. Every
p organ of the body is properly fixed by
. this attitude.
a The feet should rest squarely upon
the floor; the hands should rest lightly
I in the lap and thus perfect equilibrium
I and rest is secured. The arms should
never be crossed, for that position
causes a strain upon the spine, places
a weight upon the stomach and dia
phragm and thus increases the labor
of digestion and respiration.
SOnce in awhile it is a good thing to
Splace the arms behind the back. giving
as it does the tfullest expansion to the
_ upper part of the body.-N. Y. TVorld.

-Miss Harriet Weed, who has just
died in New York, was probably more
familiar with the mechanism of poli

woman who has lived during the last
three-quarters of a century. She be
came so through her knowledge of the
operations of her father, the late Thur
low Weed, who was a political operator
of unsurpassed skill and subtlety.
Miss Weed possessed many of the traits
of her father. She was of a very re
tiring disposition. and had lived in
New York for over a quarter of a cen
tury. hardly known at all to the gen-
eration now at the front of the stage.
She was of most kindly nature; she
was most amiable; she was a wvoman of
good deeds.
