they are required to use plenty of water enti
SB. n soap and their appearance on Sun
1d (lay-with their clean striped sunits, well
washed bodlies and flit, sleek skins-shows
rap- at. once the splendid effect of the model frigl
dry dicipline of Capt. Brogan. "Health is a will
prime object," says the Captain. "we re
re- gard these men as heing worth to us see
$1,500o each, and we "take care" of them manlr
aeccordingly. Good, whllolesome food and W

low' complain in the least are immediately
put, are, to my mind, a sure remedy for te
all diseases, almost." And to show the ef- qua
facet of tihe Captain's logic there has been l
tlin t one man in tile hoslpital within the nor
rtie past six months, anld hle with a sprained tlir
a- foot. But oneman, in a crowd number- knm
ing over three hundred, has died in a con

t re- was coutracted ontside. On Sunday they wli
have a ration of tobacco, enough for a
lends week's time, while on that day all work
ime, is nsuspended and the convicts are allowed
vited to romp, sing, dance, fiddle, preach, play
from carlds-in fact to amuse themselves, 1
within the enclosure, which is large and ing
roomy, as they may desire. And they pr
iety, do enjoy it. Card tables with monte for
.Car- banks which seems the favorite game,
ass and stacks of tobacco cit in regular
sten- sized sections and whlich is the "curren
r city cy" of the prison, can le seen scattered
over the yard. surrounded by crowds of
pal eager betters. Boisterous noise is not
iv allowed amd swearing is unknown-and
- thing of that sort brings down tie strap
and curtaile the liberty they are allowed.
tn The sonnd of the violin, the shuffle of the

quarter, while "glory to Jesus" will break

Were it not for the striped clothing
anta- and the double line of armed guards, vis
itors would never suppose it a "convict

of our to escape, and strange to say, all those
fence who do are the "new comers," and the
struc- "short time men." Captain Brogan in
