An Example of Harmony.
Opelousas Eveniung Call.
We are glad to see that the Dem
ocrats of our neighboring town of
Lafayette have settle their factional
differences, and by united and har
monious mass-meeting nominated
and excellent ticket for town coun
cilrnen.
For a number of years past the
politics of that town has been in a
sot t of mongrel position, so that
notwithstanding a large Democra
tic majority the marshalship, an
office of considerable influence and
profit, has been held by a Republi
can, Mr. John Vigneaux, who was
able by a combination with some
Democrats to control the election
of the town council, a condition of
things that bred much friction and
angry factional feeling in that town.
The mass-meeting in question,
however, was participated in by the
leaders of both of the former fac
tions of the Democratic party,
which resolved that the councilmen
to be elected should appoint none
but Democrats to office. \Ve con
gratulate the Democrats of Lafa
yette upon the good step.they have
taken, and are sure that it will result
not only in the good government of
the town, but greatly to strengthen
the party in that town and parish.
The Democracy of Lafayette has
set a good example to the warring
factions of this town and parish,
and they shoul,! follow it.
The New Orleans Daily States Cigar
meets with popular favor. A real good
cigar. All like them. Sold by P. Dema

The Grand Jury.
The grand jury made the following re
port last week too late to enable us to insert
it in last Saturday's edition of The Gazette:
To the I/on. A. C. Allen, Judge of the 17t'l
Judicial court.
Your grand jury duly impanelled in. and
for the parish of Lafayette, having per
formed the duties incumbent upon them,
beg leave to submit the following as a re
port of their deliberations:
We have presented to your honorable
court indictments against sixteen persons for
various offenses, and our investigations
further required us to release five indict
ments on account of insufficiency of evi
dence.
Our etamination of the jail was thorough
and we recommend that the ceilings of said
building be painted anew as well as the
cage in which the prisoners are incarcerated.
We also recommend that it be whitewashed
and the outside cornice painted. The
water tank is in bad condition and should
be renewed, and pipe connections from
tank to cells are broken ar.d in need of re
paIirs.
The inmates of the jail told us that they
were well cared for and their general condi
tion was found to be good.
The court-house of the parish could be
made more attractive as a public building
by an application of one good coat of paint
which would not only enhance the appear
ance of the building but would preserve it as
well.
The clerk's office was found in good con
dition, the books and documents easily ac
cessible and systematically kept. We
recommend that the outside ornaments of
this office be given a new coat of paint
The sheriff's office was visited and investi.
gation of his books made. He presented
his quietus for all settlements made on
taxes up to date and he produced vouchers
and receipts which tally with treasurer's
report.
The report of the treasurer and our in
vestigations show a balance of two thou
sand eight hundred and fifty-one dollars in
treasury.
We made inquiries in reference to the
public roads of our parish and find that
generally they are in good traveling con
dition.
The public schools of the parish, we are
glad to say, through the zealous efforts of
the parish superintendent and school board,
are in a prosperous condition, there being
an attendance of over twelve hundred pu
pils with prospects of a ten months' scholas
tic term. We herewith annex a report of
the superintendent of public education for
this parish and make the same a part of our
Wer report tliat both the high school
building and the 3rd ward public school
building of the town of Lafayette, whilst
offering ample accommodation for pupils at
tending, they are at the same time an or
nament to the city, showing what united
efforts can effect in execution of good.
As our investigations have failed to es
tablish any case of the wholesale destruo
tion of fish, we herieby invite our good peo
ple to abstain from selning and using all
kinds of nets contrary to the laws of our
land.
Thanks are tefdered t> the officers of the
court for their courtesy in general and es
pecially to our district attorney, M. T.
Gordy, Jr., for kind attention and services
rendered.
Having now performed all the duties in
reference to all matters given iui in charge
by your honor's able and eikhaustive in
structions, we respectfully asked to be
temporarily dismissed.

DEATH OF LOUIS J. MOUTON.
There died in Lafayette last week
a man whose death has brought sor
row to many hearts. No one knew
Louis Mouton and did not like him.
His nature was such that to know
him was to love him. Perhaps no
man ever enjoyed a larger share of
public esteem and was more uni
versally respected. The writer of
this imperfect tribute to his memory
prized as a rich privilege an inti
mate acquainptice with this good
man, and,was in a position to ad
mire. his big heart and appreciate
his,. sterling worth. Honest, brave
and charitable to a fault, he was
the true Christian, always ready to
do good and never willing to do
a willful wrong to a fellow-being.
Though he lived 64 years his splen
did existence has not been marred
by a single unkind act. In pros
perity when fortune smiled upon
him he was the ever cheerful friend
of the needy, for no one can truth
fully say that he ever denied assis
tance to those who were in need
of it. In less prosperous days, he
bore his financial reverses with the
fortitude of a. true Chirstian and
never complained of his lot which
might have made unhappy a less
courageous soul. It may well be
said of him that his life was spent
in doing good either by word or
deed. To speak ill of his fellows
was not his failing, for words which
fell from his lips were calculated to
heal wounds and not to sting.
As a citizen of the State Louis
Mouton was true to his duties; as a
member of his church he was sin
cere; as a husband and father he
was kind and lovable; as a friend
he was true as steel; as a soldier he
was in the front rank, having joined
Company K., ad La. Rigiment, serv
ing with unswerving devotion until
the cessation of hostilities, when he
returned to his home in this parish
and engaged inplanting, several years
later moving to this town where he
lived until his death. Before dying
he made peace with his Maker and
awaited the end with that same
spirit of submission to the will of
Providence which was one of his
strong characteristics. He died as
he lived, surrounded by those he
loved best--his wife and children.
His furneral which took place
Friday at the Catholic church was
very largely attended showing in
what high esteem he was held by
the people among whom he lived
and died.
The Discovery Saved His Life.
Mr. G. Coillouette, Druggist, leaversville,
Ill. says: *To Dr. King's New Discovery I
owe my life. Was taken with LaGrippe and
tried all the physicians for miles about, but
of no avail and was given up and told I
could not live. Having Dr. Kings New
Discovery in my store I sent for a bottle and
began its use and from the first dose begart
to get better, and after using three bottles
was up and about again. It is worth its
weight in gold. We dont keep store or house
without it." Get a free trial at WVm.

TIIE CIIZESE WAR.
The preliminaries of peace be
tween China and Japan have been
signed and so practically the great
war in the Orient has come to a
close. Japan has secured what she
desired in undertaking the war;
namely, the independence of Corea,
the island of Formosa, and com
mercial privileges. So far as the
world at large is concerned, the
war will have but slight effect.
Should Japan attempt to monopo
lize the trade of the Orient, it would
meet with prompt resistance on the
part of European powers. The
results of the war are the strengthen
ing of Japan's influence in Eastern
affairs, and the increasing of that
country's power and importance.
The war has probably hastened the
westernizing of China, but beyond
this, it is doubtful whether there
has been any other result.
