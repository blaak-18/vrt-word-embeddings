SINCERELY APPRECIATED.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —I am al
most ashamed to write you since I
have been so negligent in regard to
my paper. In fact, it hasn’t been
negligence, Mr. Watson. The sim
ple truth of the matter, my dear sir,
is this: When I came to Idabel I
was just out of school and was strict
ly broke, and no doubt you know
what a hard time a school boy has
trying to get a foothold again, so
last fall I had to build me a little
home, and you may bet it put me on
the bum. Noth withstanding all this,
Mr. Watson, 1 love you just the
same, and have a feeling for you that
1 am not able to understand rayself.
My prayer has been, and shall ever
be, that you may live a long time to
educate the people to what their just
dues and rights are.
Enclosed find bank check or ex
change to pay subscription for this
year.
Hoping to hear from you in the
near future, I beg to remain, yours
in the cause, WILL J. MARSH.

A VERY KIND LETTER.
Dear Sir: —I send you five (5)
subscribers to the Weekly Jefferson
ian. I have tried hard to get the
people to see aright. I have offered
$25 to the one who would give a
reasonable objection to you and SSOO
to anyone who would prove that you
have ever gone back on the people.
I know you have been faithful, you
have consecrated your life to the no
ble cause, you have received your
wound, you have the scars, sure
enough.
Mr. Watson, your editorial on
“Soldier, Take Your Wound,’’ is the
finest language I have ever read. I
have read it to everybody in the com
munity and cry every time I read it.
I will be found on the same bat
tlefield with you, and my prayers
will always be with you.
I send you the following subscrib
ers and will send more as soon as I
have time to get them.
With best wishes for your success,
I am, Very truly yours,
W. R. ELLIS.

UNYIELDING AS TO PRINCIPLES.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I here enclose postof
fice money order for $3, for which
you will please advance my subscrip
tion to both Jeffersonians for anoth
er year. One dollar of this is for
you to help pay your campaign ex
penses. I gave $1 during the cam
paign, but learned you never got it,
so I will send this direct to you.
I haven’t voted for a Democratic
president since Cleveland’s first race,
and never expect to again. When you
give up the fight, I’m done. You can
depend on me as long as you and I
live. Some of the boys keep talking
about names. I don’t care a penny
about names, the principle is what
I’m after, call the party what they
please. William J. couldn’t get my
vote; if he were to run on the ticket
with you, I would scratch him. I’m
not going to dictate to you; I’m will
ing to leave all in your hands, and
when I can do anything for you com
mand me.
As soon as I have time, will try to
send you some subscribers.
Wishing you success and a long
life, I am, Yours truly,
W. H. COLLINS.

STORY IS ALWAYS THE SAME.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —I have
read with much interest of late, in
your valuable paper, the statements
of different parties who have been
released from the State Sanitarium,
concerning the present management
and the treatment the patients re-
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
ceive at the hands of the attendants.
For the sake of humanity, I wish to
corroborate what has been said by
giving my experiences through your
columns.
I got worked down and run down
in health last fall, and my people
sent me to the State Sanitarium for
treatment, thinking it a good place.
I will try to state the cruelty that I
saw during the forty days that I
stayed. I saw men choked almost
to death and then stamped and locked
up for about twelve days, without
enough to eat to keep a babe alive,
and denied the comfort of a drink
of water for from three to four days
at a time. I saw men out on the
yard barefooted and half clothed in
December. I saw old feeble men
dragged down to the dining room by
the head and neck. I saw the life
almost slapped out of poor crazy
men when they had not done any
thing, only got lost from their por
tico. It is the most brutish place I
ever saw. The attendants have the
hearts of beasts and not the hearts
of men. I wish to say to people who
have kindred there, that it is not the
place they think, and the treatment
is anything but good.
How long will the State of Geor
gia allow such treatment adminis
tered to the poor helpless people of
our State?
How long will the people let the
cries of the oppressed pass by un
heard and unheeded? How long will
the State listen to the statements of
eyewitnesses to these crimes without
an investigation? A State asylum
properly run is an honor to any state,
but under the present management
ours is a dark disgrace.
I will swear to what I have stated
above before any court or body of
Legislators. Yours very truly,
L. J. SPENCE.

POPULIST NOW AND WILL BE
HEREAFTER.
Dear Sir:—l am highly pleased
with The Jeffersonian. I am a Pop
ulist now and will be hereafter. I
believe you are advocating the only
correct theory on the money ques
tion, one that will give the farmers
any relief; and I am glad to see you
take the position you do in regard
to the negro.
I herewith send you a subscriber,
and wish I could send you 10,000
from this county.
Let the Populists everywhere get
together and organize clubs or some
thing of the kind.
Yours truly, W. T. TAYLGR.

AN ENCOURAGING LETTER.
Dear Sir:—Kindly allow me to
take subscribers for your magazine
at this point. I have taken it from
the first issue to this day and can
readily say that no editorials give
me such complete satisfaction as
yours; well written, yet so plain and
simple that a child can easily un
derstand and appreciate them. Only
last Sunday I re-read your “Reply to
Booker Washington,” and “The Wine
Cup.”
Continue the magazine and later
on I will make an effort to hand you
several names from this place.
Yours truly, J. T. PRICE.
Cecil, Ala.
WENT TO CAMPAIGN FUND.
Dear Mr. Watson: —Enclosed you
will find check for $3.25, for which
please renew my Jeffersonian and
send me your magazine, also send
magazine to J. W. Leslie, 1212
Eleventh Avenue, North, and the re
maining 25 cents put where it is
needed most to carry on the good
work.
Wish I was able to send you that
many dollars instead of cents.
Wishing you a most prosperous
Jeffersonian
year, I am, yours until the end,
J. R. BURHAM.

FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Dear Sir: —I have been very much
interested in your timely articles on
Foreign Missions. They are both in
teresting and instructive, and I must
say that, in my opinion, you are
right. It seems strange that people
who claim to be Christians should
resort to such base misrepresenta
tions as some have in this contro
versy. Wonder if your friend Norton
will be quiet now?
I see they are jumping on you on
every hand, and I dislike to take up
any of your valuable time, but I am
sending you herewith a copy of the
Florida Christian Advocate, under
date of May 13, 1909, containing an
editorial, “Tom Watson and Foreign
Missions.” I am sending you this
paper because you may not see it un
less some in Florida send it to you.
Yours very truly,
A SUBSCRIBER.
Perry, Fla.
PLEASED WITH OUR KNIFE
PREMIUM.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I received my knife on
May 6, and 1 return you many, many
thanks for it. I certainly appreciate
it very much, indeed. The photo is
a very fine one. I am going to get
all the subscribers I can for you.
Yours sincerely,
E. B. BETTS.

GOES AFTER PARSON SCOVILLE.
Dear Sir: —I have been very much
interested in your articles on Foreign
Missions, and I congratulate you for
having the boldness to try to get at
the truth concerning this matter. I
read with much interest your article
in last week’s Jeffersonian, replying
to an article by Rev. Mr. Scoville. I
understand from your answer that
Mr. Scoville takes the position that
it is right and proper to clothe, feed
and educate the heathen in order to
make them Christians, and cites as
authority for his position the mira
cle of the feeding of the five thou
sand. I suggest that if you will read
carefully the account of this miracle
as recorded in the Gospel of John,
6th Chapter, you will find that it is
authority for the very reverse of Mr.
Scoville’s proposition. After Christ
fed the five thousand on the Sea of
Gallilee, near Tiberias, He crossed
over the Sea to Capernaum, and was
followed by the crowd which He had
fed. When He faced them again He
did not feed them, but rebuked them
in the following language: “Verily,
verily, I say unto you, ye seek Me
not because ye saw the miracle, but
because ye did eat of the loaves and
were filled.”—John 6-26.
He then proceeded to explain to
the multitude that He was the bread
of life. After this explanation the
record makes this sad statement:
“From that time many of His dis
ciples went back and walked no more
with Him.”—John 6-66.
The conclusion which any sane
man would draw from this Scripture
is that the Saviour Himself expressly
repudiated the idea of converting
men with loaves and fishes.
Trusting you may continue to pub
lish the truth, I am,
Sincerely, . A FRIEND.
P. S.:—Wonder if Brother Scoville
ever read your “Napoleon and Story
of France?” If he did, the fact that
he called you a “decadent politican”
shows that pearls have been cast be
fore swine. If he didn’t, he may
thank God and take courage, for he
has something to live for, and he will
retract when he reads those books.
I have been thinking for some years
that somebody ought to read the
preachers a few kind lectures for
putting too much emphasis on mon-
ey, and you are the only man in the
Union who had the courage to do it.
I glory in your spunk.
Clarksville, Tenn., May 10, 1909.
THEY BELIEVE, BUT WON’T
VOTE IT.
Dear Sir: —I feel like congratu
lating you, as The Jeffersonian and
Watson’s Magazine has about filled
all the people here with enthusiasm
over your editorials especially. We
all know what mail brings them and
then the town bunches all over the
streets to listen at some subscriber
read the news from you. What con
fuses me is that while nine-tenths of
the people endorse your views, when
it comes to voting nine-tenths of the
voters don’t vote for you. Why it
is so I can’t understand.
The matter was attempted here in
a sermon preached by the Rev. J. M.
Tumlin explaining to a degree why
you was so fussy, especially about is
sues interesting the people so much,
“to-wit”: that you was a good man,
he had known you and lived near you
several years and your misgivings as
to mission ideas could be truthfully
attributed to ignorance. Mr. Tumlin
lives and preaches here now and ad
vocates, to a very great degree, all
missions, with church lieutenants on
the go night and day gathering up
money for the various mission insti
tutions. Certainly he believes he is
right and doing a Christian work.
I read and love to read your pa
pers. I love you, too, and all Popu
lists, politically at least, and al
though it is late in the day, am sorry
to learn from such a source as my
information comes that you have
some loose screws about your cra
nium, but you are not hurt here yet
but making friends by your foolish
ness.
Long live The Jeffersonian and
Magazine, and long live Tom Watson.
Your admirer,
JAS. F. JONES.
Hogansville, Ga., May 11, 1909.
(Editor’s Note:—Brother Tumlin
is a good and lovable man. If he will
read the June number of our Maga
zine, and then the article on Foreign
Missions which are to follow, he may
withdraw that statement about Mr.
Watson’s ignorance. Even parsons
are not impervious to new ideas and
facts.
As to the failure of our people to
vote as they believe, we acknowledge
the corn. But it is not our fault.
We have tried mighty hard to bring
about some consistency between the
prayers and the ballots of our folks.)
MISSIONS AND TEA.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir:—l have heard it said
more than once that there was never
an adulterated chest of tea known to
reach the ports of the United States,
from China, until long after the
Protestant missionaries invaded that
country. I do not know this to be a
fact, however, but I believe it to be
true, as it is plain that if a class of
people will deceive and defraud their
own home people in the name of re
ligion, it is perfectly natural that
they will teach a Chinaman to steal.
1 am delighted with your sunshine
on Foreign Missions and believe that
when Parson Scoville reads your
June number that he will be a sadder
but wiser man.
I mention the tea question simply
to call your attention to it, believing
that if it is a fact you will know it.
Much success to you, I am,
Yours very truly, W. C.
Attapulgus, Ga., May 7, 1909.
IS HE A “ROCKRIBBED DEM
OCRAT?”
Dear Sir:—l have received first
copy of all papers and magazines or
dered through your Jeffersonians,
and am well pleased with them.
