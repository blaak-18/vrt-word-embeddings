Summary of Events
Dr. Frederick A. Cook, of New
York, an “amateur”, is believed to
have discovered the

atory, states that he reached the Pole
on April 21st, 1908. A more de
tailed account from him was received
in New York, as follows:
“With only two faithful Esqui
maux and what were left of 103
dogs, I reached the North Pole on
April 21, 1908. The thing was done.
The battle against hunger and cold
was won.
“With the discovery of the Pole,
some 30,000 square miles of new ter
ritory have been added to the map of
the world, and at the central point,
at exactly 90 degrees of North Lati
tude I planted the flag of the United
States of America.
“My expedition grew out of a sum
mer cruise that I undertook with Mr.
John R. Bradley in August, 1907.
There was no definite intention of
making any dash for the Pole unless
conditions happened to be ideal.
That they turned out, more or less
unexpectedly to be.”
It is earnestly to be hoped that the
Pole has at last been reached and
that the long toll of bitter hardship
and death will cease with its definite
conquest.

tention that the Pole could be of
nothing but scientific value, after all.

Wickersham, “it will be defended.”

ence to what is known as
the Cunningham claim to
valuable coal lands in
Alaska. Here, again, we see the be
nevolent efforts of the gentleman
manipulating the Interior Depart
ment, who has been exceedingly anx
ious to confirm the claim to these
lands by certain individuals. Alaska
has resources, that, to use the hack
neyed term, are boundless; and Mr.
Ballinger is fired with a desire to see
that all this wealth is purchased, for
a nominal consideration, by parties
who will control it for their own
benefit. Alaska has begged piteously
for statehood, which is postponed
again and again. Unable to protect
herself, therefore, she is hopelessly
subject to the fair dealing of the De
partment of the Interior in respect to
lands, mineral wealth, etc.
Mr. Ballinger would probably say
to this, as he has said about lands
involving large water-powers, that
“no private individual has applied
for them.” Private persons with in
comes of from S3OO to $3,000 a year
are not buying immense timber
tracts, or waterfalls, or coal mines;
but they are, in the aggregate, pay
ing for all these things and demand
of Mr. Ballinger that their rights,
and the rights of posterity, be not

It was Mr. Taft’s pleasure to sur

Wall street, men hopelessly mired
and besmirched by their long service
to predatory corporations; and that,

tion, he should become involved in a
maze of scandal was to have been ex
pected.
We have here at length discovered
the real difference between the
Roosevelt and the Taft policies. If
“my dear Senator” or “my dear offi
cial” were caught, none so scathing
in denunciation as our Theodore. Mr.
Taft prefers to hug the caught to his
own ample bosom. There is no real
difference as between the honesty of
the two executives; but it makes lots
of chance for newspaper powwow and
for the partisans of both to dash to
their defense.

Ormsby McHarg, for instance, has
petulantly resigned from the Cabinet'

present one. Little Ormsby is pout

will lose his services, and it is
little short of a public calamity
that Ormsby has veiled his coun
tenance with frowns. He knows, as
do we all, that the uncaught Roose

the derisive finger at the caught of
the Taft crowd.

Pullman until a seat becomes vacant
in the ordinary car. This is in line
with simple fairness. Next, it would
be quite gratifying for a railroad
commission somewhere to take up
the matter of the “solid Pullman”
trains which constantly force the
needy passenger, or the one who is
riding but a short distance, to spend
a dollar or two for a seat, or else be
delayed, incur hotel bills and other
expense. The purchase of a ticket
should imply the right to sit down
in the next train going to the passen
ger’s destination. The solid Pullman
is the limit of extortion. Surely the
railroad does enough to force Pull
man patronage by making the day
coaches as dangerous, as unclean and
uncomfortable as possible on most of
the lines, without resorting to abso
lute hold-up methods. One is accus
tomed meekly to accept the stuffi
ness and vulgarity of the Pullman,
because by contrast with a coach that
is always dirty, and in which there
is never any water or any provision
whatever for comfort it is preferable,
but even patient “Mr. Dubb” must
feel indignant at being actually
forced to invest in an expensive plush
purgatory for himself and family,
whether they need or want it, or not.

A new phase of the “yellow peril”

Russian citizens. If this plan suc
ceeds, it is sure that thousands of
their countrymen will adopt the
method of arriving at Atlantic sea
ports, claiming Russian birth. The
complications may readily be imag
ined. How can these yellow people
be deported, under the existing im
migration laws, if they purport to be
Russian citizens of the admissible
kind?
Japan, desiring Korea for its own
exploitation, will hail this new
means of exiling, both the Koreans
and the Japanese, of the worst class
(Korea being now over-run with the
criminals of Japan) and the adoption
of a little longer route will not de
ter the wily Mikado from getting rid
of his undesirable subjects by the
thousands. They are evidently go

slope, then over Mexican and Cana
dian borders, and on the Atlantic
coast. Well, maybe the East, which
is so fond of brown and black men
in the abstract, will get enough of
them herself some day to realize
what their presence means to our civ
ilization.
Japan, with a consistency almost
Bostonian in its beauty, has shut out
Chinese from the Korean fisheries.
Japan is for the Japanese, and so is
all the rest of the earth. We may
well admire the aplomb with which
Japan takes possession of every oth
er country, and immediately shuts up
legislation in such other countries

izens.
