yet our sanctimonious and misguided
people send untold sums of money
across the seas to a race of people
who will in a few short years prove
their great appreciation by becoming
our most aggressive enemies. We
are warming and feeding' a viper in
our bosom that will turn and sink
its fangs into our vitals at the first
opportunity, then poor old Russia will
have the horse-laugh on us.
’Let us clean up around our own
doors and then, if we have any spare
energy and money left, devote both
to the heathen in preaching the gospel
in their own tongue.
Like you, I am heartily sick of all
this noise that is being indulged in
about those crafty Mongolians who
are laughing in their sleeves at the
credulity of “Melican” people and
in the meantime doing full justice to
the free lunch and other luxuries
hitherto unknown to them, while
every day our newspapers fairly teem
with heart-breaking stories of suffer
ing for the absolute necessaries of
life, too often ending in shame, crime,
and murder. Is not the poor little,
ragged fellow, trudging through the
slush and snow, hungry and cold,
striving with all the power of his
poor little emaciated being to keep
soul and body together only to huddle
dow’n in some little forgotten corner
when the shadows of night gather
with his poor little frozen feet drawn
up under him, falls asleep, only to
awake in the presence of a Jesus
that no one took the trouble to tell
him about —I ask, is he not worth
as much to our blessed Lord as some
moon-eyed Celestial, with no higher
ambition than his opium den, and we
might add those luxuries furnished
him by those wonderfully gullible
people across the seas? Doubtless
some day Mr. Rockefeller will startle
the world by a discharge of a larger
amount of his ill-gotten wealth into
the yawning* coffers of foreign mis
sions, while those whom he has robbed
will have the proud privilege of starv
ing and freezing in the wretched
hovels and tenements, the only home
they ever knew.
Yours as ever,
R. F. Lackey.
TAFT AND PANAMA.
Clyde Park, Mont., March 2, 1909.
Mr. Thomas E. Watson,
Dear Sir: I have been a.reader of
your magazine for only a short time,
but I think it is advocating principles
which, alas, are too little discussed.
I would like to know what right
the government had to furnish Mr.
Taft with a cruiser to go to Panama
in. I fancy if any other private
citizen, with perhaps the exception
of a few pets of the boss power,
wished to visit the canal and inspect
the work there, he would have to
pay his own way, and then, if he
wanted to go on a warship he couldn’t
even get a tender to a torpedo boat.
Wishing you the best of luck, 1 am
Yours very truly,
J. D. Lovely.
AN ENCOURAGING LETTER.
Lawrenceville, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: Enclosed find
$2.50, for which send me both your
Jeffersonians, and “Paris Modes and
Patterns.”
■Have been taking your weekly for
some time, and as you made mention
in an editorial in last issue that you
would have an article in the April
number of your monthly, on foreign
missions, that would do even a Meth
odist preacher good, 1 must have it
too. I am not a Methodist, however,
but a Baptist, a layman of your
variety as to foreign missions. In
deed I am with you politically and
religiously.
Keep knocking against “man’s in
humanity to man” as you are and
have been for lo these many years.
You will not live to see a full realiza
tion of your efforts. But you will
see it in part. Yea, you even now
see the good result of your past hard
work. We are with you in all things.
Now perchance we forget to renew
our subscription. Ere it expires,
kindly put us in remembrance of
same. We take a lot of papers —all
kinds politically—and sometimes “get
behind” with some of them. But be
lieve us, Mr. Watson, we take nothing
so truthful, so fearless, or so inter
esting as your weekly Jeffersonian.
Yours respectfully,
F. B. Maddox.
Lawrenceville, Ga., No. 1, Box 39.
Ashland, Ala., R. F. D., No. 3, Box 46,
March 10, 1909.
Dear Sir: Please answer in weekly
Jeffersonian whether you think it is
beneficial to a young man to carry a
policy in some life insurance com
pany. If not, why not, —B.
Answer: If the young man has no
competency and there are those who
must depend upon him for a support,
it is advisable to carry life insurance.
The Old Line Companies, however,
charge at least one-third too much.
One of the well-established fraternal
orders is best.
VOTES FOR PRINCIPLES, NOT
PARTY.
Holton, Jackson Co., Kans.
Mr. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: Being a subscriber to
both of your very valuable publica
tions, and the time having expired, I
wish to renew for both. I have been
a subscriber to your magazine, start
ing with your first New York issue.
I heretofore got your paper and maga
zine through our mutual friends,
Messrs. Dixon & Lankford, of the
Missouri World. They are noble,
honest mon, and I am truly sorry for
their'downfall in business. They were
too honest to stand the strain.
After you withdrew from the New
York partnership, Mr. De France
wrote me asking me to send him ten
dollars to assist in keeping T. E.
Watson magazine before the people.
I did not answer him, as I did not
want the Watson Magazine with the
Watson man left out. I hope and
pray that your humane effort for
the uplifting of the wealth pro
ducers of this country may be suc
cessful and that the God of the
universe may grant you and yours
health and prosperity. I did not go
to the late election as there was no
Watson ticket to vote for, and I never
vote any other ticket. If I can’t vote
my principles, I prefer not to vote
at all. Would to God that the Ameri
can people could see the dishonesty
of the twin parties. Vote for what
they want in the people’s party, with
brighter chances of getting it than
through either of the trust-owned
parties. 1 am nearing my 87th year
Bfye 3efTersottlan
mile stone, and unless the people soon
see the tendency to which our poli
ticians are drifting us, and get back
to the Jefferson idea of equal rights,
I fear I will not see in my lifetime
the happy change for the better we
mutually hope for, and that you have
so nobly given your money and talent
to accomplish. Enclosed please find
two dollars for both of the Jeffer
sonians.
Wishing you health and prosperity,
I remain,
Yours respectfully,
R. T. Kartrens.
TIME UNPRIVILEGED SHOULD
LINE UP AGAINST PRIVI
LEGED CLASS.
Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: The Democratic party
claims to stand for equal rights for
all and special privileges to none, and
the equal burden of taxation, which
is the vilest kind of hyprocisy. Un
answerable proof—the ranks of this
party have thousands in it who are
recipients of the benefits of Repub
lican class legislation, bankers and
manufacturers, and to these Taft had
reference when he referred to “the
business interests of the 'South” in
his Atlanta speech.
The real stand for genuine equal
rights for all and special privileges to
none would drive nearly all the bank
ers and manufacturers out of the
Democratic party. It is time the un
privileged of all political parties
should line up against the specially
privileged class of all political parties.
‘The honest stand for equal rights for
the farmer and all professions and
the equal burdens of taxation, and
special favors to none, with the initi
ative and referendum and recall, will
do the work as soon as the masses
understand them. W. E. Ivey.
QUEER WORLD, ISN’T IT?
Manassas, Ga., R. F. D. No. 1.
Dear Editor: If you will just allow
me a short space in your Jeffersonian
I will send you a few lines as to the
condition of the feet-trampled farmer
and a word about the foreign mis
sions. lam in favor of Mr. Watson’s
position in regard to missions.
Foreign missions seem to be run
upon the same system as the town
schools are. The commissioners and
the boards tax the farmer and get
the money and build their school
buildings, then the board and commis
sioners will not appropriate as much
money as it will take to pay a teacher
to teach the country school, and thus
force the farmer to send his children
to the towns to school, where he is
charged uncalled-for prices for lodg
ing them. Then, when he goes to
town with a load of provisions to sell,
the good folks there will begin telling
him what an independent and pleasant
life the farmer has. Still, the people
who tell you this will linger around
town if they can find any place to
hand their hat and say “I am so
tired living in town.”
If you owe one of your neighbors
five dollars and offer to pay him on
Sunday, if he is one of the preacher’s
stewards fie will not take your money,
but he will take up collections for
the preacher on Sunday, and if that
is not contracting business on Sunday,
dear Editor, tell me what contracting
business is, Very truly yours,
Jeff Thomae,
Are You
Sick?
Much sickness is due to'
a weak nervous system-
Yours may be. If it is,
you cannot get well until
you restore nerve strength
Your nervous system is
nature’s power house; the
organs of your body get
their power from it. If
the power is not there, the
action of the organs is
weak, and disease (sick
ness) follows. Dr. Miles’
Nervine cures the sick
because it soothes the
irritated and tired nerves
and gives the system a
chance to recuperate.
Try it, and see if you do
not quickly feel its bene
ficial effect.
“X was given up to die by a le&d
doctor. Got one of Dr. Mlles
books and found that Dr. Miles’ Ner
vine *fit my case. From the very first
dobs I took I got better. I am better
bow than I have been for years, and
do aH my own work on the farm..
That's what Dr. Miles’ Nervine has
do&c for me, and I am glad to recosn
moßd it to others.”
