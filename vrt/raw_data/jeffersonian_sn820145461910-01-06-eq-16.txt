No Breadth Nor Tolerance
President Taft’s ill-concealed and
thinly veiled contempt for Demo
cratic States and Democratic institu
tions should be more carefully sup
pressed, especially during the time
that he is the President of a Union
of sovereign States.
Various patronizing references to
this section of the country have,
from time to time, aroused the ire
of our people, or at least a majority
of our people. On his way to Rich
mond last fall, President Taft made
his first “break” along this line,
when, at Bristol, we believe, after
some ill-mannered people had hissed
him, he lost his temper, and gave
voice to a contemptuous character
ization, not merely of those in his au
dience, but of the whole Southern
people. It was a slip, of course, but
in that momentary flash of anger
many concluded that he disclosed
what was really in his heart and
mind.
Last week, in the course of some
remarks at Phoenix, Arizona, Mr.
Taft expressed some misgivings lest
the people of that State might not
understand fully the responsibilities
they would incur should their as
pirations for separate statehood be
realized. As a matter of fact, both
Arizona and New Mexico are proba
bly as w r ell qualified for statehood as
the people of Ohio, Mr. Taft’s own
State. Mr. Taft himself knows very
well that Arizona, as well as New
Mexico, have been denied admission
as States not because of their lack
>
of enlightment, but because a jeal
ous Republican party declines to ad
mit two territories that would be
Democratic States. But the Presi
dent’s most serious breach of good
taste was a very contemptuous ref
erence to the new State of Oklahoma,
and her constitution, which he char
acterized as “a zoological garden of
cranks.” It was undignified and un
worthy of the Chief Executive of the
United States to thus refer to the
serious work of the people of Okla
homa and their fundamental char
ter. The President should set an
example to the people of the country
in entertaining a proper regard for
the institutions of the several States,
of giving the several peoples credit
for the honesty of their acts, and of
showing appreciation of the dignity
of State sovereignty.—Richmond Ev
ening Journal.
THE RURAL CARRIER EQUIP
MENT COMPANY.
The Rural Carrier Equipment
Company, recently organized in At
lanta, Georgia, with offices at 84%
Marietta St., is doing a big business
by mail in the rural sections of the
South. This company was organized
particularly to supply Rural Letter
Carriers with all equipment they
need, but has extended its line, so
that many essentials for the home
and farm can be supplied.
They have made great progress so
far, on account of fair dealing, low
prices and quick deliveries. The
company being located in Atlanta,
the distributing center of the South,
it is able to meet and sell at the
lowest prices. Their advertisement
of a sewing machine in this issue for
$15.50, a $35.00 value, is an illus
tration of their method of doing
business. It will pay our readers to
get in touch with this progressive
house.

THE ISSUE
EX-GOVERNOR JAMES K. VARDAMAN’S
PAPER FOR THE SOUTH
Published Every Saturday Morning at Jackson, Mississippi.
Vardaman was abused at first: he was called an agitator, an
alarmist, a firebrand; but at last the sober second thought of
the people began to waken and they began to listen. Today
what he has to say on the race problem, is the word of the su
preme authority. Combining all the knowledge or writers on
this question, from dawn of history to the present time, ap
plied and measured by personal observation and first-hand
knowledge, Governor Vardaman has a message to deliver of
huge import to the American people today.
