Most Diseases Cause by Constipa
tion. Sewerage of the Brain
“It goes to the brain naturally, and
to every part of the body, every organ
being fed on this polluted blood, or
sewerage. It goes to your face in the
form of pimple-poison and creaks out
on the skin. It goes to your head and
gives you headache and dizziness, it
goes to your brain and makes you
drowsy, it weakens the stomach and
causes dyspepsia, and bad breath, it
goes to the liver and causes bilious
ness, it goes to the kidneys and even
tually gives rise to Bright’s Disease,
it goes to the heart and makes it
thump, it goes to the eyes and they
lose their lustre, it makes your nerves
flabby and weak and out-of-sorts, and
this is the advance agent of all kinds
of disease, which you couldn’t get at all
if there was pure, rich, red blood flow
ing in your veins and your whole body
was in prime condition.”

conditions at McKees Rocks plant
must be truly horrible, and are cer
tain to grow worse unless public sen
timent can be aroused to demand
a change. As long as the steel com
pany can depend upon government
aid to fight its battles, just so long
will the reasonable demands of the
employees be treated with contempt.
Ten thousand street car employees,
in Chicago, have been about to tie
up the transportation facilities of
that city, but it is believed trouble
there has been averted by an offer to
the men of 30 per hour after
August, 1911. In this case, Presi
dent John M. Roach, of the North
and West Side lines, treated prompt
ly with the president of the Carmen’s
Union, the president of the South
Side lines concurring. The revolu
tionary tendency in Spain is largely
the protest of the industrial army
against the cost of an unjust and un
necessary war, and against the cleri
cal yoke. At point after point the
protest of labor is being sharply em
phasized. All ovei’ the world there
seems to be a growing consciousness
that no political rights are worth
while that do not result in substantial
benefit to the masses. Time was
when “For the King!” was sufficient
to hypnotize the serf into giving his
last ounce of blood; men fought, and
achieved but a change of equally
hard rulers. Then the ideas of dem
ocracy took root, and we in
America voted faithfully and freely
under our partisan banners, only to
learn even so late as this summer that
we hadn’t sense enough to better our
condition, for all the “battle of the
ballots.” The fetish of a name tolled
all but a handful along the two old
lines, only to find that they were
bartered and sold, as usual. Political
freedom is an end, until obtained;
when it becomes merely a means to
better ends —sound legislation, wise
and good laws.
Will the strikes drive this lesson
home to all mankind?
The Legislature adjourned on the
12th inst. and this is a brief review
of the bills passed, not
Georgia many of which have yet
Doings. been signed by the Gov-
ernor;
“The Price substitute to the Alex
ander amendment of the near-beer

“To provide for continuance of us

“The house and senate both sus
tained the action of Governor Smith
in suspending S. G. McLendon.
“Employers’ liability act.
“Joint resolution providing for an
investigation committee to probe
charges brought against State Hos
pital for the Insane.”
Several of the more important
measures which were under consid
eration but not passed are comment
ed on editorially in this issue, and the
main bills, as signed, will be noted
later.
The report brought in by the com
mittee appointed to investigate
charges made by the Jes-
Asylum fersonian of brutality
Horrors. and mismanagement at
the State Asylum at Mil
ledgeville more than sustains such
charges. The committee found that
up to June 85 patients have died of
tuberculosis this year, the disease in
nearly every case having been con
tracted at the institution where the
crowding and lack of proper sanita
tion favors the spread of the infec
tion. It found the class of attend
ants were, with few exceptions, of
low grade in every respect; brutal,
untruthful, drunken and that women
patients had been mistreated by
them in at least one well authenti
cated instance.
The committee indulged in no de
nunciation whatever. The plain facts
are sufficiently horrible to render un
necessary any re-touching of the pic
ture. Where so much brutality, ig
norance, filth, disease and immoral
ity that can actually be proven ex
ists, it requires no imagination to
understand the many wrongs which
must have been committed against
the unfortunate creatures at Mil
ledgeville but which are not suscep
tible of actual proof.
The testimony of no insane person
is credited about anything, yet every
one who understands anything of
mental disease knows that an indi
vidual may be violently insane upon
some topic, and yet quite rational
upon most others, and that his or her
testimony is as often true as exag
gerated. The physicians and people
in charge of such institutions are
grossly negligent, therefore, if they
do not rigidly investigate the com
plaints made by the patients. Only
a state of persistent deafness and
lack of consideration for the claims
of humanity could have resulted in
such a condition of affairs as exists
in Milledgeville.
It is said his Satanic Majesty al
ways has an advocate, and we find
the Sanitarium (?) is supplied in
this capacity by Dr. Geo. Brown, of
Atlanta, who waltzes to its defense
with the curious statement that the
inmates are furnished with clothing,
food, light, heat and attention at a
cost of 34 per capita! That, in it
self, is enough to condemn the insti
tution, for no human being can be
kept in a state of health on 34 cents
per day, much less cared for by at
tendants. And if a man in charge of
a State institution realizes he can’t
care for its inmates on the allow
ance, it is up to him as an official of
integrity to resign and explain why,
instead of hanging onto a job know
ing that the creatures under his au
thority are miserably treated. Leav
ing out beatings and such positive
cruelties, 34 cents a day spells icy
wards in winter, insufficient clothing
for warmth or cleanliness, wretched
ly cheap, scanty food. Where does
“treatment” come in? Medicines,
dressings, etc., that must be neces
sary at times for each patient?
It is up to Georgia to clean out the
institution thoroughly, and abolish
the economy that means suffering
and death to its helpless wards.

Catarrh is not only dangerous, but it
causes bad breath, ulceration, death
and decay of bones, loss of thinking
and reasoning power, kills ambition
and energy, often causes loss of appe
tite, indigestion, dyspepsia, raw throat
and reaches to general debility, idiocy
and insanity. It needs attention at
once. Cure it with Gauss’ Catarrh
Cure. It is a quick, radical, permanent
cure, because it rids the system of the
poison germs that cause catarrh.
In order to prove to all who are suf
fering from this dangerous and loath

will actually cure any case of catarrh
quickly, no matter how long standing
or how bad, I will send a trial pack
