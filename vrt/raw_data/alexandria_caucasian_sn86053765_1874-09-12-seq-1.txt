POETRY.
A LITTLE ELBOW ROOM
MY ARCIIER ALLISON.
Good friend, don't crowd so very tight,
There's room enough for two ;
Keep in your mind Mint, I have a right
To live as well as you.
Yon rich and strong, I poor and weak,
Bill think you I presume.
When only this poor boon I ask —
A little elbow room J
'Tis such as you, the rich and strong,
If ynu lint have the will.
Could give the weak a lift, along.
And help him up the hill.
ISut oh—you joxtlc, crowd and drive,
You storm and fret and fume ;
Arc you the only man ulivo
In want of elliow room 1
Rut, Hum it, is on life'« round path,
Self seems the (Jod of all ;
The Htrong will crush the weak to death,
Tho big devour the small.
Far better bo a rich man's hound—
A valet, serf or groom—
Thiit, struggles 'mid the mass around,
When we've no elbow room.
Up heurt, my boy ! don't mind the shock ;
lîp heart and push along!
Your skin will grow rough with knocks,
Your limbs with labor strong:
And there's a hand unseen to aid,
A star to light the gloom ;
Up heart, my boy. nor be afi a id,
Strike ont for elbow room.
And when you seo Amid the throng
A fellow toiler slip,
Just give him as you pass along,
A brave anil kindly grip:
Let nolde deeds, though poor yon be,
Your path in life illume.
And with true Christian charity.
Give others elbow room.
ANACREONTIC.
Oh ! if my love offended me.
Ami we had words together.
To show lier I would master be,
I'd whip her with a leather.
If then she, like a naughty girl,
Would tyranny declare it,
I'd give my love a cross of pearl.
And make her always bear it !
If still she tried to sulk and sigh.
Anil throw away my pirnlcR,
IM catch my thirling on the sly
And smother her with roses !
But should she clench her dimpled lints.
Or contradict her betters,
I'd nianaelo her tiny wrifiiH
With dainty, golden fettcis !
And if she dared her lips to pout.
Like many pert yonug misses,
I'd wind my arum her waist about
And punish her with kisses !
GOLDSMITH MAID.
AN INTERESTING SKETCH OK Till
ANIMAL WONDER.
Evansville Journal.
The "Maid" was a wayward child.
From the date of her birth on the
farm of John B. Decker, in Wan
läge township, Sussex county, N.
Y., in the Spring of 1*57, to the age
of six years, sho distinguished her
self in many ways, but never as a
trotter. She was undersized, ner
vous aud Irctful, aud utterly re
fused heavy tarm work. Mr. Deck
er, her owner, snys lie never got
any work out of her but twice, one
half day in plowing coin, and oue
half day in drawing stones. Once
she was hitched to a harrow, but
after a short distance she reared
backward and entangled both her
hind legs iu the cross-piece of the
harrow, and so injured those mem
bers that when she goes out for lier
morning walks, it is said, she still
shows signs of stiflness behind
caused by this fall in her early life,
From the time she was six
months old until Mr. Decker sold
her, she was used as a race horse,
though without her owners knowl
edge. The boys on the farm, ot
course, as boys do, were auxious to
know which was the speediest ani
mal, and at an early day they
found it was the Maid. And so, af
ter the "old man" had gone to bed,
they would take her out of tho pas
turo or stable whenever a race was
made up, and run her on the road
alter uight. Sho beat everything
that could be brought to run with
her, so that finally noue but the un
informed from a distance could be
found to bet îtg;tiiist her. These
races were made up at the country
stores and lounging places in the
evening after farm work was over»
and the race run tho samo night at
ter the "old man" had gone to bed
No training, no grooms, no jockeys,
no weight for age—just a man or
boy in his bare feet, mounted bare
back, with his toes hugging the
mare's belly like a leech, was the
style, and the Maid no doubt en
joyed it more than sho has some of
her late races in tho trotting ring.
One day, in the summer of 1803,
two men were out buying horses for
the army, and stopped all night at
Mr. Decker's, and in the morning
bought the "Maid" of him lor $200
and started for home, leaving the
inare behind them. On their way
they inet a Mr. Tompkins, who
know the littlo mare, and bought
her of them for f300. The two men
also knew her aud believed that
she could bo made a trotter, but
were willing to make $100 by their
morning's bargain. The next day
Toinpkin's sohl her to Alden Gold
smith, an excellent judge of horse
flesh, of Blooming Grove, Orange
county, N. Y., lor $000. . From him
she took the name of Goldsmith
Maid. He kept her in pretty steady
training under a driver named W.
I Iodide, to whom, more than any
other living man, Rhould be award
ed tho credit of first bringing the
mare out. The renowned Budd
Doble, who now drives her so hand
somely, had not then either seen
or heard öfter.
While in training for the trotting
course she was so fretful and irrita
ble, so determined to run at every
opportunity instead of trotting, so
hard to bring to a trot after break
ing from that gait, that Mr. Gold
smith many times determined to
give up the training and sell lier
at any price, but his patient driver
mniiitaiiicd his abiding faith in her,
and assured his employer that she
was the fatest animal on his pretni
so» and would come out at last a
great rrotter, and finally persuaded
him to keep her, which ho did un
til this driver so brought out her
points that Mr. Goldsmith in No
vember, 1808, sold her to B. Jack
man and Budd Doblo for $20,000.
These gentlemen sold her to II. N.
Smith for the sum of $37,000. Mr.
Doble still drives lier. She made
her first appearance iu public in
August, 1805.
IIe Wanted a Handsome Bar
Made .—Ex-Congressman Marvin,
who is tho "Warwick behind the
throne" in tho new United States
Hotel, called on a carpenter yester
day, and said :
'•Mr. Thompson, we have a nice
bar-room, and wo want a handsome
bar ine de. Who can make the best
one ?"
"Well, I-I d d don't 'zackly know
who could m-in-mako a handsome
b-barwiaid," stammered Mr. Thomp
son.
"No, no. I want a nice hand
some bar made "
"W-w-well, dang it! if you want
a handsome barmaid, why don't
you go over to T-TTroy and get
oue T
"No, no, no, man ! I mean who
made these I sell all around town !"
"Great guns, Marvin ! H-h-how
the d-d-devil do I know who made
all the b-b-barinaids around town f
I d-d-dou't know—and damfi care
who did!" shrieked Mr. Thompson.
A correspondent explains that
married men have their hair cut
short during the vacation, because
they do not, in the absence of their
wives, need it to deaden the blows

It
I
A
of
POST MORTEM LOVE.
Why is it that so many people
keep all their pleasaut thoughts
and kind words about a man bot
tled and sealed up until he is dead,
when they come and break tho bot
tie over his coffin aud bathe his
shroud in fragrance|f Many a man
goes through life with scarcely one
bright, cheering, encouraging, help
ful word. He toils hard and in low
ly obscurity. Ho gives out his life
freely and unstintedly for others.—
I remember such a man. He was
not brilliant ; be was not great ;
but ho was faithful. He had many
things to discourage him. Troubles
thickened about his life. He was
misrepresented and misunderstood.
Every body bolieved that he was a
good man, but no one ever said a
kindly or pleasant thing to him.
He never heard a compliment—
scarcely a good wish. No one ever
took any pains to enconage him, to
strengthen bis feeble knees, to
lighteu his burdens, or to lift up
his heart by a gentle deed of love,
or by a cheerful word. He was neg
lected. Unkind things were often
said of him.
I stood by his coffin, and then
there were many tongues to speak
his praise. There was not a breath
of aspersion in the air. Men spoke
of self denials, of bis work among
the poor, of his good qualities, of
his quietness, bis modesty, his hu
inility, his pureness of heart, bis
faith and prayer. There were many
who spoke indignantly of the char
ges that falsehood had forged
against him in past years, and of
the treatment he had received.
There were enough kind things said
during the two or three days that
he lay in the coffin, and while the
company stood around his open
grave, to have blessed him and
made him happy all his fifty years,
and to have throwu sweetness and
joy about his soul during all his
painful and weary journey. But
his ears were closed then, and could
not hear a word that was spoken
His heart was still then, and could
not be thrilled by the grateful
sounds. Ile cared nothing then for
the sweet flowers that wero piled
upon his coffin. The love blossomed
out too late. Tlio kiudncss camc
when the life could not receive its
blessing.
And I said then that I would not
keep all my kind words, and all
my pleasaut thoughts and feelings,
about my ueighbor, locked up in
my breast till ho is dead. They
will do him nojgood then. Iiis dead
hand cannot feel the warm pressure.
Gentle words will not make his pale,
cold face glow. It will be too late,
when ho lies in his coffin, to seek to
make him happy, to lift tho shad
ows oft his life, or to brighten his
path.
It costs but little to give men a
great deal of joy and help. One
brought a bunch of flowers to my
table, and for a whole week they
filled my room with fragrance. One
wrote me a cheering letter, breath
ing a spirit of gratitude aud love.
It came when I was weary and de
pressed, and was like the meal pre
pared by the angel for the old
prophet. I went on its blessed
strength for many days. One met
me on the street and spoke an en
couraging word and grasped me
warmly by the hand; and for hours
I felt that warm grasp and heard
that word echoing through my soul.
A little child may brighten scores
of lives every day. There is not
one of us who may not gladden and
strengthen many a heart between
every rising aid setting sun. Why
should we not live to bless the liv
ing, to cheer the disheartened, to
sweeten caps lhat are bitter, to
hold up the bands that hang down,
to comfort those that mourn, to
bear joy into joyless homes t Kind
words will not spoil a man. If a
sermon helps yon it will do the
preacher no harm to tell him so.—
If'tho editor writes an article that
docs you good, he can write a still
better ouo it you send bim a word
of thanks. If a book blesses you,
do you not owe it to tho anthor to
write a grateful acknowledgment 1
If you know a weary or neglected
one, would it not be such work as
angels do, would it not be Cbrist
like work, to seek every opportuni
ty to brigbton and bless that life 1
Do not wait till the eyes are closed,
the ears deaf, and the heart stilled.
Do it now. Post Mortem kindness
do not cheer. Flowers on the coffin
cast no fragance backward over the
weary days.—[Rev. J. It. Miller, in
Sunday School Times.
GETTING A PHOTOGRAPH.
He was a very pleasant spoken
man—that photographer. He said
it was a nice day, and that we need
ed a little rain, and that the Ar
kansas difficulty was a bad thing,
and that photographs were three
dollars per dosen —no orders book
ed without the cash in advance.
He wanted to know if I wanted full
length, halt length, bust, face or
what. I told him "or what," and
he yanked bis camera around, flung
his big screens recklessly about,
poked the skylight curtains this
way and that with a long stick,
and then he ordered me to sit down.
"There—that way !" he said, as
he jerked my body to tho left and
nearly broke my spine.
I went that way and he stepped
back, closed the left eye and squint
ed at me.
"Shoulders np !" he said, as he
gave them a twist which made tho
blades crack.
Tiien he went to tho left and
squinted, and cried, "ha!" and went
to tlio right and squinted, and
shouted "um !" and he came back,
seized my bead and jerked it up un
til 1 saw stars.
"That's bt tter !" ho said, as he
walked back to the camera.
But it wasn't. He came back and
told me to twist the right shoulder
round, hump np my back, swell out
my chest, and look straight ât a
butter fly pinned to a corn starch
box, and be as pleasant as I could.
"Capital !" he cried, as he took
another squint through tho camera,
"only"— '
And he rushed back, jerked my
head a little higher, pulled my ears
back, brushed up my hair, and
said I'd better try to smile and look
natural.
"How the dev—" I began, but he
waved his hand, and said I must
preserve my placid demeanor.
"Now sit perfectly still and don't
move a hair," he whispered, as he
threw a black cloth over tho brass
bound end of the camera, and made
a sudden dive into his dark den.
As ho «rattled the glass and
dashed the acids about, I felt a big
pain in my spine, a small pain in
my chest, another in my neck an
other in my ribs, but I said I'd die
first, and I kept my gaze upon that
butterfly.
"Ready now !" bo cried, as he
jumped out and put in the glass.—
My head began to bob, aud the
butterfly seemed to grow as large
as ahorse, and he whispered:
"Look out—keep perfectly still !"
I braced tor a big effort, and he
jerked down the cloth. I felt as if
the fate of a natiou rested on my
shoulders, and I struck to it. He
turned away, audi heard him talk
ing to himself. After about an hour
aud a half he put up the rag, jerked
out the glass and ran into the den.
He was out iu a moment, and as
he held the negative up to the sun,
he said:
"Ab! you bobbed your bead; have
to try it again!"
