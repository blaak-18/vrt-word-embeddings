co0111lnues and from thle present out
look not lmore than a week will elapse
befort all the claims will have been
taken up. So far as known there has
been no blood shed, although shots
were exchanged in many cases.
Up to midnight Wednesday night a
person would well imagine himself in
the heart of a hostile country. Fires
marking the corners of claims were
lighted by the thousands and these,
together with hundreds of men camped
near them reminded one of a bivouac
at war.
Colonel Ketchum. at the head of
twelve cowboys, well-armed and mount
ed, carried the Aspen country by
storm. At midnight they rode forward
down the section lines, setting stakes
as they came to the corners. As the
first stakes were being driven they
were greeted by a volley of gunshots
from opposing locators, bht the bul
lets all went wide of their mark.
'Swinging to their saddles the party
darted forward nod did they cease un
til they had located every section open
for filing. Then, retracing their way
the found that the opposing parties
Shad. inmany cases, pulled their stakes
and burned them in the fire. These
were replaced and the triumphant par
ty returned to file their claims.
In the Spring Valley country there
were fiat fights on every side, but the
men refrained from the use of fire
arms.

:an gathering at dayliri..a . N
Year'- morning on the great piniai
outside the city. The. they wait lt
t pa't ntly for thle suaprI tmo an:outll nee
ment of the durbar. that King Eid.ar;i
was emperonr of India. Soon tle great
plain was filled with crowding ntas.;a ;
of people and the brightly colored
clothing of the vast tarong covered
the space with gorgeous hues. The
crowd on the plain was composed
largely of the common people, but
among it could be seen the retainers
of the various rajahs, who had aa
sembled for the function.
The attention of all v:as fixed upon
the white amphitheatre in the center
of the plain where the announcement
was to be made. The amphitheatre
was adorned with gilded cupolas and
surrounded by batteries, squadrons
and battalions of the Indian army. Be
yond the amphitheatre, in the dis
tance tould be seen greata numbers of
elephants. camels and horses. So
vast was the multitude that the
troops alppeared as mere splashes of
color.
The arrival at the amphitheatre of
the viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of
Kedleston, and other dignitaries and
the princes was one of the brilliant
episodes of the day. The princes were
clad In silks and adorned with jewels
and their horses and carriages were
brilliant with trappings of gold.
The spectacle within the arena was
most striking and gorgeous. The Pa
than chiefs and the Sirdars were re
splendent in brilliant raiment.. Sol
diers, civilians and visitors from far
distant countries were included among
those within the amphitheatre. Upon
the entrand~ of the veterans of the
Indian motilny there was tremendous
aenthusiasm and as the arrivals
marched to their places the bands
played national air. The carriage of
the Duke .of Connaught,, who repre
sents Kilng Edward, was escorted by
a detachment of cavalry; as the duke
and the duehess were driven around
the arena the assemblage gave them
an enthotislat. welcome. Amid the
acelamtions. of the people the duke
tookb ig seat at the left of the throne,
whil'- the duchess proceeded to a
placo behind the throne.
When the great-amphitheatre was
Ailed and the hour for the 'announce
ment drew near the multitude within
and without awaited expectantly the
Arat act of the proclamation cere
mony.
Then the approach of the viceroy
wias h'lalded. Preceded by members
of kis bodyguard clad in white, blue
and gold :-and: uder the command of
rajor Grimaton, Lord Curson appear

boy a minute with a glance somewhat
akin to admiration; then he moved to
the next chair and said:
"Tell him I'm not In my seat."
"Al right, Hepburn," said the boy as he

Speaking of Germany's hostile dem
onstration off La Guayra, Representa
tive Patterson of Pennsylvania said the
other day:
"Germany's excuse that the Venezue
lan vessels she sunk were old and en
seaworthy reminds me of the excuse
givep by the son of a neighbor of mine
for killing a colt. The animal was
slightly defofmed about the head, but
otherwise was healthy and gave pros
pect of making a useful horse. One
day the old gentleman came home and
found his colt lying in the farmyard
with his throat cut. On inquiring who
had killed it his son Jephtha declared,
'Why, I did, father.'
"'What did you do that for? angrily
demanded his father.
"'Why, the brute was-deformed and
of no use,' answered the young man in
Justification of his deed. Germany has
taken the property of Venezuela and
destroyed it because it was 'deformed
and of no use.'"
The recent memorial services held by
the senate in honor of the late Senator
Sewell of New Jersey,
Called when many glowing
Ca non's tributes were paid to
Bluff his memory, recalled
many stories and incl
dents characteristic of
him.t Here is one told the other day
in the senate cloakroom:
"I was in a meeting of conferees,"
the narrator said. "in which Senator
Sewell and 'UIncle Joe' Cannon were
contending for the legislation of their
respective houses.
"Fi iaily 'Uncle .Joe' brought his hand
down with a thump on the table. 'I
shall stay right here until the senate
yields.' he declared.
"Senator Sewell regarded him a mo
ment with that cold and stern look he
could at times assume and then, turn
ing to the clerk of the committee, said,
'Mr. Cleaves. will you kindly arrange
to have my meals serve~ in this room
for the remainder of this session?'
"I may add that both gentlemen ate
their dinner that night in their own
hotels."
A day or two ago a Maryland con

Representative L.oud of ('California,
who was defeated for re-election by a
big majority, was in a railroad wreck
when he was coming east the other
day.
"Heard you were in a wrenk. Loud,"
said Colonel IIepburn of Iowa.
"Nothing to speak of." answered
Loud. "After my experience on elec
tion day a glacier could run over me
and I wouldn't feel it."
A western congressman tells this
story of precoqlty of western youths:
"I used to think,"
Hard Strait mid Mr. Deweese,
"that Huck F!nn and
to B5at Tom Sawyer as well
as Peck's Bad Boy
were interesting but fantastic crea
tions. That was before I acquired two
boys of my own. The other day, to
my great horror, the elder of my boys
was sent home from school in disgrace.
Naturally I was somewhat wroth at
the youngster and sat In judgment on
his case.
"'What's the trouble. Johnny?' said
I severely. 'What did you do?'
"'I don't know, papa,' said he.
"'Don't know?' said I incredulously.
'What do you mean?'
"'Well.' he replied gravely, 'the
teacher asked the class what a strait
was. and when I put, up my hand she
called on me.' There witas a little pause.
"'What did you tell her?' I inter
jected impatiently.
" 'Ace. king, queen, Jack, ten,' said
he, without the shadow of a smile.
'Wasn't that right, papa?'"
The other day Secretary Root invited
two men, who know much about the
Philippines and of whose knowledge
he desired to take advantage, to break
fast with him at the Arlington, so that
they might have
a talk about the
archipelago. On
the morniing -set
for the engage
ment the secre
tary forgot all
about it and
went to the din
ing room and
breakfasted
alone. When he
came out into
the lobby, he
found his two
friends waiting
for him.
"Why, good
morning." said
t h e secretary.
"Come right
along to the of
fice. and we can
talk matters
over." "GOOOD MORNIING," SAID
TH SECRBETARY.
The two men
thought this meant that Secretary
Root wanted to have a short talk with
them before breakfast, and they went
along without protest. When they
reached the office, they sat down and
talked until 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
Then the secretary thanked them and
Iade them goodby. Five minutes later
two hungry men dashed madly into
the 'ne.rtt restaurant and ordered
nearly everything in sight.
The next day Secretary Root remem
hered and spent half' 1he forenoon
hunting up his friends and apologizing
