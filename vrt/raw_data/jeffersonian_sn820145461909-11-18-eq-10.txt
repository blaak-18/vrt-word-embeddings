Jeffersonian Club News
At a meeting of Jeffersonian Club
No. 4, Lithonia, Ga., the following
resolutions were adopted unani
mously :
“We protest against the present
Tnanner of working public roads in
DeKalb county.
“We protest against the action of
the last Georgia Senate in not favor
ing an amendment to the constitu
tion for a graduated income tax.
“We protest against an offleeseeker
begging and buying votes to be elect
ed, and then selling his own vote and
voice after election.”
The club also voted to endorse the
platform and principles of Club No. 1
(Thomson, Ga.).
The regular monthly meeting of
Jeffersonian Club No. 1 was held at
the courthouse, Thomson, Ga., on
Thursday, November 11, and was
well attended. It was resolved to
hold a public meeting at Thomson on
Thursday, December 9th, and to in
vite a number of well-known speak
ers. It was also resolved to make ar
rangements for a public meeting at
Iron Hill schoolhouse on Saturday,

The Jeffersonians have placed an
order for some buttons, to be used
temporarily by club members, until
the State organization shall decide
upon a permanent design. The but
ton, in accordance with the majority
of suggestions received, will be
seven-eighths of an inch in diameter,
having the head of Jefferson in the
center, on a white ground, the outer
circle being red, with the words
“Jeffersonian Club” and “Reform”.
Secretaries of clubs are requested to
make application for the number
needed.
THOUSANDS IN SAME FIX.
My Dear Sir: —The following is a
letter 1 have just received from a
mother who is a relative of mine.
She and her family are as honest and
hard-working humans as ever
breathed. They have lived a life
time, done their part and failed.
They belong to that class of people
of whom Oliver Goldsmith sang:
“An honest yeomanry, a country’s
pride,
When once destroyed can never be
supplied”,
or in similar words which I forget
just now. No father ever labored
more faithfully, no mother ever
managed her household with greater
economy. No parents ever looked
with tenderer or more hopeful eyes
upon their children, and, after a life
time of toil, self-sacrifice and drudg
ery, saw with sadder hearts their
early hopes for their offspring
crushed to dust, and their children
doomed to beat out the same misera
ble existence of poverty and ignor
ance which the parents themselves
had led. They are farmers (ten
ants). What is the cause, Mr. Wat->-
son;
To me every word in the letter is
a tragedy. An extract from it fol
lows:
“William (her husband) is very
gloomy over his crop. Thinks he
can’t come out. There is nothing in
Jeffersonian
this world for us, and I suppose we
had just as well give it up, but I
know we haven’t much longer to stay
here and I try not to trouble over it.
I hope we have a home in a better
world than this.”
Prosperity may be here, but I
know that these industrious, honest
hearted souls, who deserve it, have
not got it. Your friend,
READER.

TOM WATSON’S GREAT WORK.
Thirteen years ago there were five
rural free delivery routes in the Unit
ed States; today there are upwards of
forty-one thousand of them and the
number is being constantly increased.
Last year twenty million people were
served daily by this service. Ex-
Congressman Watson, of Georgia,
must feel pleasure in noting the great
growth and prosperity of this child
of his brain.—Savannah Morning
THE HALF-CROPPER.
(Concluded from Page Two)
out and make them work harder.
The consequence was he was
knocked down about three times and
very willingly went back to his den
and said he had never seen such
men,’ that they would knock a man
down if they didn’t have a dollar in
the world just as quick as they
would if they had thousands. This
is the kind of material they are made
of, but many of them have been
robbed and oppressed until they
have lost hope, and we readily ad
mit that they are more in slavery
than ever the negro was, for his
master always fed and clothed him,
but we are not willing to admit that
they are lower than the negro. We
know that in many of the homes of
the half-cropper true virtue, a true
manhood reigns supreme, and many
of them have, by persistent toil and
close study, climbed the ladder of
lame far above those who class them
with negroes.
It is a great pity that we have in
free America a system that is rob
bing the poor of her own race to edu
cate the heathen of other countries.
t is enough to make the Goddess of
Liberty hang her head in shame.
Now, henceforth and forever let us
try to help and encourage the poor
half-cropper and let us all remem
ber they are by nature and by birth
our own brothers and listers.
While the colored races are no re
lation whatever, and our first duty is
at home, let us see that those half
croppers have a chance at least equal
to the colored races.
How any one can have anything
but deep sympathy for the poor of
their own race is more than I can
understand, and let us all remember
that our Saviour was a reformer and
was also very poor; yes, so very poor
that He had no where to lay His
head.
Wishing you and all reformers
great success, I close this address
before I get stirred up and say some
thing more from Slocomb, Arkansas.
