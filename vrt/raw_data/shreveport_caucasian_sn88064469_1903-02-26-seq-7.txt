self-defense, declaring he received
messages and information that Editor

cluding two revolvers. While cartying
these up the street he met Mr. Gon
zales, who, he stated, pushed a hand
Ibto his.pocket. Believing his life to
be In danger Tillman hurriedly said:
"I got-your message." and fired, firing,
the affidavit declares, to save defend
ant's life.
Affidavits introduced by defense sup
ported Tillman's statement in many
jetails.

e--
' OW do you manage to keep so
cheerful?" I asked the friend
who had had many troubles.
"Because s have to." came
the answer.
And while *was pondering oveP Ser
odd reply Miss Jones was announced.
Now, Miss Jones was young, with a
plump, rather pretty face and a nice
figure gowned in an up to date tailor
made. She should have been attrac
tive, but instead of that the minute
she came into the room one felt the de
pression of the atmosphere.
But my friend greeted her cordially.
"Sit down. Mary, dear. and have a cup
of tea," she remarked cheerily. "and
tell me how everything goes with you."
Mary took the steaming cup and
dropped into lb two lumps of sugab.
also a sigh.
"Oh. I am so discouraged!" was the
first sentence we heard from her lips.
"It is so fearfully hard living this sort
of life. I shall die if it keeps on."
"But you are doing well in your busi
ness and earning a large income." my
friend suggested cheerily.
"Oh, I suppose so. but you can't un
derstand. A never was brought up to
- .,
SUNSTIND AND SRADOW.
do this sort of thing. It's perfectly aw
ful, and then I never know how long
my luck Is going to last!"
"Nonsense! You draw such clever
sketches you cap easily get some other
work when this fails you."
The answer was another sigh.
"What has become of that handsome
young lawyer you were telling me
about?" my friend put in archly, with
a -Vain attempt to make the conversa
tion less lugubrious.
"Oh. be doesn't call any more. I hear
he is paying a good deal of attention to
thatfi'ch Bessie Atwell. Very natural.
I'm sure. I would if I were a man. I
knew it couldn't last, living alone as I d
do and having no money or family.
Ien, like every one else, are out for
what they can get," etc.
It was a positive relief when she left
and little Susie Brown took her place.
Now, there was nothing remarkable
about Susie. either in face or costume.
In fact, when you came right down to
It, her clothes were rather out of style
and shabby, but her face fairly shone
with courage and good nature, and
when she greeted my friend her smile
actually seemed to fill the room.
"Well, how goes it?" said the latter.
"Oh. so much better." chirped Susie
"not that I have had one of my stories
accepted yet, but the editor said my
last one showed great improvement,
and they have given me some fashion
work to do. Isn't that lovely ?"
"Are you not very lonely living by
yourself?"
"It Is rather hard at times." Susie
admitted, her genial face a shade
graver. "especially since mother died.
but then every one is so good to me.
It Is wonderful, too. for I'm not pretty
or clever or intersting. and I can't give
them anything in return- Don't you
think this world is just full of the
kindest. most disinterested people. Mrs.
Caldwell?"
When we were by ourselves again.
Mrs. Caldwell turned to me with a
grave look. "Maud." she said. "when
I experienced my first sorrow and was
first thrown on my own resources I
was just like Mary Jones. I wanted
every one to know and to feel my
sorrow. My life was one perpetual
whine. punctuated with outbursts of
tears on friends' shoulders. The result
was, my dear, that I lost nearly every
friend I had. The'men were the first
to go, for men are not patient with
tears, and all but my very oldest wom
en friends followed suit. To this day
I don't blame them. People don't want
to invite shadow In their houses; they
prefer sunshine. Other girls used to
get asked around, and I was left out.
I used to wonder why. and blame the
people, until one day I woke up from
my bad dream and realized how abom
inably selfish I had been. In this world
you get just about what you give. If
you radiate sorrow, you receive sorrow:
if selfishness, you receive selfishness.
That is why I go about preaching the
gospel of cheerfulness and practicing
it as well. It's the only way iit this
world it you want peace and happi
age3."I MAUD ROBINSON.
