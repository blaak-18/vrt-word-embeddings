THROUGH The GAT ILS GOLD
By Nina Hill Hill 'Robinson
HERE was once a moth
er of Glendower (and
there are many such mo
thers) who gazed into
her baby’s eyes as a maid
en looks into the limpid
depths of a wishing well
on a fair May morning.
But this mother was a
dreamer. Upon an intangible some
thing, the baseless fabric of a dream,
ahe built her fine and beautiful the
ories. With marvelous patience she
built them, while the cold, dull facts
es a bare, dull life lay thick about her
in uncompromising persistence.
•Still,' as I said, this mother was a
dreamer; and it was ever the gilded
hope of something higher, something
more worth while, that led onward
her quiet footsteps. There had once
been a time for her when from the
♦racked and distorted mirror of her
humble home she had looked into the
♦till wells of her own sad eyes and
dreamed impossible things. But that
was long ago. Opportunity had passed
her by, and youth with its love and
joy. The grim inclosure of Glen-dow
er hills offered no outlet to her fairer
world; and the something that beck
oned beyond she had watched with
wistful eyes and listened to its call,
but never followed.
She married rather late in life;
and, whether driven by the force of
circumstances, the sweeping current
of custom, or pressed along the nar
row paths of environment, she mar
ried nevertheless as the daughters of
Glendower marry —a horny-handed
son of foil, ignorant, honest, a sun
burned specimen of man in jeans
trousers and cotton suspenders.
Thus ended her youthful dreams.
In her still more narrowed life duty
wag now her watchword. She was a
loyal soul, and many a winged courier
which her fancy had sent speeding
out over that far-distant and beautiful
world she had now to call in and leash
carefully to silence and oblivion. Her
married life lay within a cleft of the
blue Tennessee hills that was called
a “smiling valley,” just beyond the
sharpened hilltops that overlooked
Glendower —a secluded vale, with no
glimpse of the outer word save
through a gap over the shining river,
where the western sun poured in a
golden glory.
She married well, the neighbors
said. The farm never failed of a liv
ing erop. Its bottom fields, enriched
from spring floodings of the border
ing river, was put to corn year after
year. The hillside pasture, scrubby
♦hough it was, proved a goodly feeding
ground for sheep; and the hill lands,
rich in nuts, angelico, and wild arti
chokes —what a range for swine I
There was a strip of blue grass woods,
blue-green enough to arouse the envy
of the hillside farmers; and the dou
ble log-house, with its wide, open pas
sage way —why, it was built to stay!
Did I say that her life lay within
this rugged valley? Perhaps it were
truer to say that she lived chiefly
within the log walls of her home, look
ing forth from its narrow windows
as her fettered sould had vainly looked
toward an impossible future.
Hers was a treadmill existence.
Luxury had never looked her way.
The help of servants she had never
known. Life for her was a bare and
dreary routine of drudgery; and the
“treadmill existence” was over a bea
ten path, back and forth from kitch
en to milk dairy, back and forth to
the pasture bars, to the spring under
the hill, with just enough of ascent
and descent to make the way weary,
and rounded into curve enough to
catch the sweep of winter winds and
the beating summer’s heat.
Yet it was in the kitchen, where
she knew naught of conveniences, that
she spent herself. Her duty here was
to cook and serve three meals each
day. Year after year the farm bell
tolled off the number of them—the
taps for breakfast before the sun had
flushed the east, the “dingdong” of
the noonday dinner, and taps again
for supper through the chill evening
mists.
The home itself was cleanly.
Though bare of comfort, it was evident
that some presence had softened the
rude outlines of the interior with a
refining touch. There were home-knit
rugs and fresh white curtains. Cheap
pictures brightened the rough walls,
and in the best room was a white
covered table with a few books in
worn and homely covers; but books
they were, and the housewife was
wont at spare intervals to slip in and
handle them reverently, as though
they were sacred things, to read their
dim pages as if she were tasting for
bidden sweets.
She had no rebellious thought, how
ever, over her lowly lot. Hers was a
docile, pliant nature, slipping into a
servant’s place uncomplainingly, and
ministering to the wants of her lord
with unquestioning fidelity. Yet she
was in no sense a fatalist; she mere
ly accepted life as it came to her.
She was, notwithstanding, a dream
er. Not as the world dreameth did
she spin her beautiful fancies, not
with the world’s wisdom or ambition;
but barren, perhaps, of all human rea
soning, she dreamed of her missoin
of loving-kindness. Her unworldly
soul longed not for selfish preferment
or earthly honor, but for a place in
the world to show forth God’s good
ness and his beauty, to send out from
her own storehouse a tithing of her
gifts unto others.
It was doubtless this reserve force
within which fed her soul and made
existence possible. Her love of the
beautiful was like a fountain of wa
ter springing up into renewed life
with every morning’s toil. Her senses
were delicately toned, responding
gratefully to some chance influence
of refining quality. A song, a prayer,
a flower, a distant star, or even the
little brown wren which sang from
her low-eaved porch sweetened for her
many a weary hour; while never a
floating cloud passed her vision that
her eyes did not catch and hold its
solemn beauty.
Her ears were deadened to the
sounds of the farmyard—the monoto
nous “dingdong” of the dinner bell,
the yelping and snarling of the pack
of hounds, the clucking of fussy hens,
quacking of ducks, and screech of
guinea fowls; the lowing of kine or
the bleating of sheep. These were fa
miliar noises, heard and not heard;
but ah, how quick was her ear to
catch the song of the meadow lark
*3«ft**sonian
soaring tsp from the fields, or the
notes of the wood thrush far and
sweet —0 sweet and far! —from the
depths of that blue-green pasture!
Her eyes were dulled to the sight
of home surroundings—the kitchen
walls, the dairy with its pans of
cream and jars of butter, the mullein
stalks on the scrubby hillside, the fa
miliar objects that one may see and
yet not see.; but how beautiful to her
was a glimpse of the river across the
fields, where the setting sun poured
his glory through that one gap in the
valley!
She lingered often at the back door
when her slender wrists strained at
the bell cord and caught in her quiet
face the shimmer and sparkle of that
distant river. How cool and restful
it was there, where wood violets grew
in spring, and strange, rare flowers
blew in dainty fashion! How sooth
ing the ripple of the waters through
the long June days, when dragon flies
floated by on gauzy wings! How soft
the skies! How sweet the murmur of
leaves, the hum of insects, and whir
of wings—the low, soft lullaby of na
ture! It was the receptive attitude
of this pure and beautiful soul that
caught the lovelier phases of life while
she trod her round of duty arid toil.
Os rest she had little —not even one
day in seven she called her own.
There was no Sababth bell in the val
ley to ring out the days of toil or ring
in the days of rest. The first day of
the week was one of odd jobs among
the neighbors, when sheep were count
ed and salted, stray hogs were driven
in, or colts broken into harness. It
was more often a day of social hours,
when visitors dropped in to discuss
the crops and seasons or the newest
news from Glendower Post Office.
These Sunday ordeals were borne
by the patient housewife over the heat
and toil of the kitchen stove. Yet
there was never a Sabbath that she did
not hear over the Glendower hills
the tones of Rehoboth church bell —a
solemn sound that strangely stirred
her longing heart. It was rare that
she went to church —through a long
interval of time that, gowned in sim
ple fashion, she climbed the high road
to the village and sat among the wor
shipers at Rehobotn.
As I have said somewhere, great
men preached at Rehoboth (or men
who were great in Glendower), men of
culture, of libera] education, and
broad-minded charity. There were
among them certain ones who read
aright the wistful, serious eyes of this
solitary worshiper, and were inspired
to nobler utterances than they had
deemed themselves capable of.
But little they dreamed of the pain
at her heart or the tumultuous
thoughts that rioted in her brain.
What a fate was hers that she had
learned to discriminate between the
rude mannerism, the uncouth, unlearn
ed physical man and the cultured in
tellect, the gentle bearing, and noble
uplift of the Christian scholar! She
learned with exquisite nicety to de
fine the difference between the two.
The Christian gentleman (she had
no thought of any other) —she knew
him by the clothes he wore, by the
pallor on his brow, a certain refined
east of feature, by his strength of
