one of them being taken sick
summoqed a woman servant to car
ry a prescription to an apothecary
for some medicino, butthe 0 servant
got frightened out of her wits, said:
that there was a burglar concealed
in a certain closet. oTbe woman
went straight to the doorand said,
" # If there is anybody in this closet
let him come out!" whereupon a big,
sinister looking negro stepped °i'ort h
The woman then with the utmost
coolness handed him tho prcserip

there is a child in the house." Thej"i'
black burglar left, without 'a word.'
Meanwhile the woman, who became
a little faint, called a neighbor.
The latter was about to go to the

a cleric called with it, saying that
negro had brought the prescription
and theu disappeared.

ithe idea that artillery might be
used efl'i-etiveh iu fighting with the
Indians by dispensing with gun-car
riages and fastening the, cannon up
on backs «if mules. So he explain
e«l his views to the commandant—
and it'®ivas determined to try the
.experiment. A howitzer was se'ect

and set up a target in the middle
of tlie® river to practice at. The

j|j j(J target, and he was backed gent
a time-fuse in the touch

retired. In a minu!8i or two the
hitherto unruftled mule heanl the
tizz^ng back there on his neck, and
it made him uneasy. 11 h reached
his head around to ascertain what
was going on, and, as lie did so,
his body turned and the howitzer
began to sweep around the horizon,
i The mule at Jast became excited
and his curiosity grew more and

the major rolled over the,,ground

was he? A solitary jackass-might,
have been, seen turning.successive
back somersaults over the bluff, on

his howitzer at the bottom of the
river, while the ball went off to
