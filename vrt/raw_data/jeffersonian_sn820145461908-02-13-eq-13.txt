Without haste and without rest,
Let each man wheel with steady sway
Round the task that rules the day,
And do his best. —Goethe.

Why
Suffer?
If you suffer pain from
any cause, Dr. Miles’ Anti-
Pain Pills will relieve it
—and leave no bad after
effects. That’s the impor
tant things Neither do
they create a habit. More
often the attacks become
less frequent, or disappear
altogether. Dr. Miles’
Anti-Pain Pills have no
other effect except to re
lieve pain and quiet nerv
ous irritation.
“We are never without Dr. Miles’
Anti-Pain Pills. My husband and
son, aged 15 were always subject to
sick headache until we began using
these Pills, and they have broken
them up entirely. Don’t think they
have had to use them for six months.
I recommend them to every one. A
few weeks ago I heard an old lady
friend was sick. I went to see her.
She was down with LaGrippe, and
nearly crazy with awful backache.
I gave her one of the Anti-Pain Pills
and left another for her to take in
a short time. They helped her right
away, and she says she will never tee
without them again. Last winter my
husband was taken with pluerisy on
both sides, and I know he would have
died if it hadn’t been for the Pills.
In less than half an hour he was
sweating, and went to bed and slept.**
