A Special to the Cincinnati Enqtir

* gro prefers to follow the teachings
,linstilled to him by Radical bum
Smer, if ho)catenot rule the country he
will leaveit. The special says :
This city is at present the objective
point of vast numbers of negroes
" from Southern points, principally the
d plantations of Louisiana and Mississ
y ippi. Every north bound boat brings
up a cargo of pllanlation hanmds anmlI
their famnilies, and tie levee is in
points their camping ground, the
vast mnajority being too poor to pay
't for even the meanest lodging. Some,.
parties down Southl have started the
story that extraoidinary inducements
are being offered colored people to
- settle in Kansas, and that any one
a landing in St. Louis will be provided
t by the Railroad Company with free
pass for himself and family to Kan
sas, food on the way and farm and
II money to live on when the railroad
lands are reached. The people who
have already arrived are in a most
wretchled condition, devoid, as a rule,
of food and money, and not in the

tihe authorities here can not throw
them into the river, and one or two

fer that fate to being sent back to
the homes they have just left. It is
I supposed that the canard whmich in

by schleming white people in the
South, in order to get the colored
residents to leave tile little properties
I which many of them possessed. Muchl
indignation is felt at tile steamboat
men for not checking the folly, and
Mayor Overstaltz has determined to
enjoin the boats from bringing more
negroes to the city, by virtue of an
ordinance which prohibits the bring
ing of paupers into the city. The

which controls the charitable bequests

ed, the city will have to provide for a
small colony of utterly helpless citi,
zens, as these plantation hands are
perfectly unacquainted with city ways,
and unable to make a living in-almy
other way than by agriculture. In
the mean time, the Southern planters
are doing their best to check the
movement, which threatents to de
prive them of their means of raising
. this year's crop.
The Work Laid Out.
That the Demosrats have resolved
upon the repeal of time odious statutes is
Sdelnitely settled and this fact is causing
r the adlniuistratiomn io little nuaoabiness.
It has been stated that Hayes would re

they be in the leant discommoted, may
eause him to think aud act didlerently.
Speaking of the work laid out by the
IDemocrate a Washigton special to the
New Orleans Time says:
The firSnt thing to be delone will be the
repeal of the United States etatutes, in
eluding the test oath and other kindred
objectionable fetnres, posse comitatus
.Isat, or elarse ia the statutes allowing
the nuse of the army at the polls.
These will be repealed as separate
measures, and senmt to thie President for
his signature. If he vetoes them, they
will be tacked ou to the legislative, ex
ecntive and jndicial applrlri;ntion bills,
which authorizes the salarieeof Congress
mea,judges, the President and cabinet,
amd eumployes in the various departmeuts
to be paid.
If the President vetoes this bill Con
grew will adJourn amod go home.
No Congressman can get a peany of
pay until the bill is passed and approvedl,
nir can any employee of the government
from the Iecreltary of tt ,e down, be paid
after June 30th.
As the vast force here, and in all the
Spublic oleers of the conutry is lepubli
can, there is sone equirusing under tihe
preposed applcatiom0 of the screw, The

If he thian the way to make his party
solid is to starve out his friends in soft

are wiped out o9rpistance.
Upon this the majority in both honesg
are unchangelable. The power of public
patronage will be taken away from the
Republican party whemmever its emnployee

is an election in Ohio this fall, it is
