The Issue.
We have made the issue in Louis.
iana as sharp and distinct as that
nmade by the National Democrats at
St. Louis.
The fladicals tolunghout the State
prayed and hoped that the honest
men of the State might blunder upon
the nomination of some man whose
past record would lead to a luke
warmniss during the camn paign,orlone
of such extreme views on some one
point that the conserviative element,
so called, would "go over" to the
enemy. We say that they hoped this,
but in that hope they stand lost ; for
the general who expects to succeed
by the blunders his opponent may
commit, and relies not upon his own
strength or eause, his always met and
will always meet defeat.
We say that the issue has been
made sharp, distinct and vitaln and
that issue is honest! against $'dlainy.
There can be no appeals made to pas
sion atnd prejudice ; there shall lie no
appeal made to bayoners ; no colored
or white man shall be intimidated
"bulldoosing" will not he tolerated
and "Union right stops" will be put
down promptly and effrclualy.
We have said all along that no one
intimidated the negro save the rad
ical and we say so still ; but with the
nomination of such a ticket as that
at Baton Rouge, we pledge ourselves
that it must cease.
No fear of troops shall deter a' sin
gle white man in the State from doing
his free and full duty as a citizen un
der the law ; and no midnight con
clave of scheming radical carpet-bag
thieves shall oath-bind the colored
man to do their bidding, nor shall the
scalawag scoundrel hunt down col
ored most for voting for whomu they
choose. Tlat issue is made and it
cannot-be dodged !
Packard and his backers represent
radical role in Louisiana ; that rule is
written in abandoned Ilelds, desolate
households unmarked graves, ravaged
women, violated rights and plunnder
ed treasuries from one end of the State
to t he other. Show we a Packard fol
lorer, and we will show hins to be a
criminal, either convicted under indict
ment or trembling in fear of an honest
Grand Jury.
This the colored man shall under.
stand. He shall know who plunder
ed this parish; who robbed the school
treasury and suffered his children to
go uneducated ; who used him as a
tool to further despoil and ruin the
State. All this. the negro must and
shall know ; and when he does learn
it, as he is fase doing, then farewell,
radicalism..
All this cry of violence comes from
none but radicals-it is the cry of the
thief to "stop the thief !'
Where ts the tadicEl in this parish
who fis offered violenice to-day and
where is fite radical in thie parish
who has not outraged every principle
of honor, virtue or decency. We
say it and say it boldly, that there is
not one radical in this parish who is
not ascendrel and a thief; who is
not an open, avowed, active enemy
of every principle of Americlan liberty;
who is not a public enemy to soietety
and who does not deserve the pen
Itentiary or the hangman's rope;
hence this cry from those that live
but in trembling fear of bare justice.
Do they not walk the streets and
ride the country unmolested, filling
their dirty papers with lying assaults
against the very people they charge
with violence: buhot tis issue is moade,
tls must be stopped. We propose.
to and will prove every nssertion we
make and tle'raificals amst and shall
stand by thefr slanders.
Our pute~rrnr and eandibtes mean
aggressiot from the start. 'ihey are
refords promiseres and tefort'or mnen;
our fines are formed, our banntes a-re
flung to the breeze; from the Atkan
ass line to the Gulf goes uip from the

the shout of the onslaught of our hosts.

bly and enthusiastically received
e as thait Of the Baton IRonge c,n
t vention jist "atjortitned. All factions
a were completely reconciled by the
Q nomination of Gen. 'rancis T. Nich
olls, of Asscltiioliti, for Governor,
e and of the lion. Loris A. Wiltz, of
Orleans, for Lieutenant Governor.
"'The ticket is a strong one," so
r say dttr enemies; and we say that no
, ticket has been nominated in Louisi
r ana since t(le war, that so completely
1 posseses all elemenuts of invulnera
' ble sttengtlh.

'I to be the "IItoN.ci;oA 'PlCKI:T OF flfE

Sslaughllt ngainst thcini
. The teiandtier' of the nominations
are in strict keepinig with the heatds
a of the ticket; and the gentlemen
l Inamed for positions are well known
- to dur'people; and are ttrue honorable,
11 virtuous, intelligent iand capable men.
t To say that the ticket will be elected,
expresses ilot at satl;ll atom of our
e certainty 6f success. T'he leemo
cratic!Cdfetsergative party have nmet,
e fully and ably{ the requriremrents of
t the hour, and tfte futute if bliglht

The lines are drawn on on f'e ide

tious, lionorable and blessed; bletween
these the voter must eshdose~ and we
a have no apprehension of how they
I will.
S"To do is to sInceCed--our light
ls waged in Heaven's approving sight -
The smile of God is victory!"
Insolence.
If anything was required to dis
t prove t!,e charge that Natchitoches
s and her people were seeking, as the
B roaring lion, radical gore, the inso.
I lence of their month-piece wounld be
Sa sufficient refutation of the worn
e out calumny. To properly under
stand the situation of our people, one
hlas but to read the history of the
neacts and character of the Radical
t leaders of our parish. This history
is fresh in the minds of every one in
.the State, every one almost in the
Union, and is too firmly fixed in truth
I to be shaken by any denial. Eight
, per cent taaration is an evidence of
t Radical role, local rule, that stands
, out in bold condemnation of their
I anting promises ; it is an evidence
1 written on the "demands to pay, or
emmigrate," in the household of eve
ry white citizen of the parish, and
1 is evidence which they hlve neeer
dared to rebut.
When these fellows, led by men
i, ro are ind;etel at ernvieted tlhieves
I and bribe-takers-proven liarrs and
a commanders of murderous gangs of
out-laowed robbers, attempt the role
Sof "advisers" for gentlemen of our
Scountry wards, we can only say, as
Sthey will say, that it is an acnet of bra.
zen insolence hardly to be br~ioed.
Thie itngadettt leciefioe, of the
scalawa~ thieves of this parish, who
keep open "a dirty sheet esustained
in whole by the money wrung from
Sthe ithtie peoople by a villainous
printing I*, lihad better be eafeld'
how they deal in "ined sfiigng'3 to.
Swards the citizeni of tl~~, towq of

in patience thle tnfrmno's acts of these
Sthieves ad esarndets--they have
submitted to the arrest of eitisens b.t
troops offatalry,, called here at thair
Sbidding; bat it is beyond lumatt en
durance to suppose that a-r eatur c
stand the dirty insinuations of the
Sow-.flung, ill-bred curs of the Radi
eal party here, through the columns
of a dirty paper that disgraces jour
nalism. The eraven character of the

We beg to remind the New Orleans
Ialletia that. "BulidoiQsing" has not
been the fort of Natchitoches parish;
nor of the Xatchitoches tindicator.
What we advocated in 1974 and '75,
wye still consider as best tor that lime,
and subseqdent events hiavh proven
it so. We advocated oniy tdid same
violence that all men have done in
time past, who wished and did strike
a blow for their o*n liberty.
The trouble witli the Bulletin seems
to be this, (and we will try itnd be
less "haby.' in l'thetuilc in explamning
it) that it cannot hdlerstand why
people do not full in love with Boullt's
8 per cent tax government, or Myers
and Blunt's *35,000 robbery conduct
of the Public Schools, in Natciito
ches parish.
This same class of men are Rladical
leaders here now--they have not been
"bulldoozed'--but wiil, we doubt not,
be the piartles, who, when elect
ed, will reform (t) Louisiana thor
oughly. As for the slur of the Bil
lethn, and its repetition of the cant of
the Pharisee, in alluding to the deni
zens of Red River-"thme long-haired
from Bossier to Point Conpbeei it may
be passed over by simply saying tlhat
there are a vast number of gentlemen'
who inhabit the region which seepis
to hiunt the mind of the rBulletin's
Editor, as being piegnaut with the
damnable thought of war, who ara as
"respectable, anid we beg leave to
add, as muclh respected" as the idl
letin gentleman-they are as intelli
gent and as well fitted to understand
what is tlhe lproper policy to pursue
dummriag this camºpaigu as any one, the
Buhletin inftndted,
We qiuestiio the right of the Pul
ldtin to drag tihe Vrindicator into its
war on Cohidatta, for their action in
the 'Tal.Cqoh'ector-Sheridan matter a
wkek or twi sin'ee. We had nothing
to do with it; hbae never defended
at eondemnued it, bUnt the Bulletin 1
shall t0ot "put etods in' our month,"
without our decent protest, at least.
When we "assume our role" in timhe
late Sheridan--Coushuatta trouble,
which we propose to do i wit Wve ar
rive at the fadt of ihe case, frond par
ties interested an(d tininteresttd, tiho"
were on thke gronel, and wIo twill speak
anderstandingl.l, it will then be pro
per for the Balletin to read us a lec
ture "on love, politics, or war," as it
may choose.
The "Vindicator and Gen. Nicholls"
are too well connected to need an
airing in the Bhlletin. The findlea
tor was the only paper in the State
that advocated his nomination ; the
vote in the Contention will show that
the "long-haired bulldeoogers," as the
Bulletin fitcetiously terns us, otAed
solid! for Gen. Frank T. Nichols, ftoirl
first to last-the gentlemen politicians
of other portions of tihe State fmot
say as much.
We have no quarrel with the Pdl
letin, we wish none, but at the same
time we propose to defend unjust ait
tacks frem any sourde, and repel
onchlaritable impttaibnlti frts any
quarter. We irave' t quality fiheh
may be uanfortunmte, of telling patent
truths in a home-tile manner If a
lmtn is a thief or a seoundrel, we amy
so, and eat iis Ye1uaintance; if that
be "flulldooting' we plead guilty to
tlih ciarge, and we are doubly proud
it wounde the fawning time-server.

stabborn -eause. I have beardn team
of my friends speak of it, 'and .all
agte that it possesses all the iirtues
yroeelaIa for it.
White League-Conservatism,
'the teiath of the "White ieagne
elemenlt" seems td us, to cause mulch
retjoicng in the camp of the cotimon
enemy of decency and truth.
'the White League must have tos
sessed powers which caused the guil
ty soul of Radicalism to quake; that
it should thus shout peens over its
supposed demise. Fortunately for us
we cannot understand why aO much
rejoicing by Radical thieves, faintly
echoed by journals representing some
fruit of Radicalisni In the shape of a
swindling monopoly, Is indulged in,
over the hope that the "White ieague
is dead !'"
Thid holie l~and, according to our
idea, are the bulwark of liberty in
Louisiana. They have proved that
such is the case to all fair minded
men, and although we were never a
member of the League, we shall be
the last to shout over its disbanding.
Conservatism, pure and holy, dwells
only in the White League-the abor
tion that lick-spittle cowards attempt
to palnt off as Conservatism, is the
titme-servers covering. There are a
class of men in Louisiana who are as
craven as hour~hd In every walk of
life-whO would surrender every
principle of honor or manhood if
those principles met the slightest op
position. They are as the Western
politician, who, in his speech, after
ennociating lis princmiles, paused
and said, "if these are not satisfacto
ry, f will change them to suit the
convenience of the company." There
are some asses in this State who
think that a~-tx are to be deceived by
this fawning, sycophancy style of t'on=
drct-biit such is not the case.
We propose to be Conservative
when every policy of life demands it;
but in that eonirsatism we propose
to be firn and manly. No hope of
reward, or fear of punishment shall
deter us from advocating openly and
boldly our principles-and those prin
ciples are eternal, not to be bartered
away for the hope of ease or recomm
pence. Conserttisift, as uiany irgue
it, means a spirit of disgusting tem,
porisibg-means an abandoment of
every principle for expediency-of
gi!ft we are not, nor will we ever be.
'fhier' has been an overplus of such
sush i Louilsiana for the past ten
years, Ad tincift t o as to leave doubts
in our mind at to" who are most to
blame for the' *reci we see around
us-the Itdtaca` thfevogor the sicken
ing, cowardly GConmiratives.
This same clausi 16w hope that all
manliness may die-that the White
League may have eiphred i thie
State, so that for them' "thrift tmay
follow fawning."
In this let as hope that if the White
I, ea gt. be dead, those principle tfo
whiCeb they livred and contened, iffay
be ever eistrisaira ib thaI heiarts of
our people-may ever actuate us to
defend, even with our lives, theliber
ties of all eitizens without regard to
taeej eolor or previous condition.

My record on that point does not date
from to-day, nor from the war, but it
goes back from the earlier period of
my childhood, and it is well known
allong the.colored people of Assaiunp
tion ; and.I want theml to know that
I will unflinchingly protect them in
all their rights. I feel satisfied that
none of you are disposed to interfere
or deprive any one of their rights,
and if you are so disposed; you will
find tne. oppond .to you: As I said
before, If I should be elected by the
people of this State, I want when
my adnministrition .shall close to have
It said that no moan hohling office un
der imy appointmtent shiall bear and
be the proof of dishonesty, by the
simple fact of his being a: gentleman
and an honest man. [Applause.]
That is tmy platform, gentlemen.
Let us not go inlto side issues; let us
not divert upon questions of tariff.
What we are mainly interested in at
present is the advocacy df honesty,
integrity and good government. It
is entirely futile for us to go into
questions of tariff, because Hliiit is anc
issue in the national campaign.
Gentletmien, I have never sought
this nothinatijon ; (nA the Contrary, I
would avoid the resposibilities which
spring frodn this position. I know
the honor of ieing your representa
tive, indeed, but just as the honor is
great the respoftiibilities are great,
and they weigh me.down tmuich, more
thap, any personal ionsiaderation of
ambition or feeling,, by the iiruiple
fact of your regard: I spy that I have
nIot sought this nomaiuatin; bitt inas
much as you have selected me to be
your head, all I canr ask yoea is to
trust me. Give me your. conlidence,
and in giving it with God's Lretp and
the assistance of all true men, wheth
er they be white or black, no matter
what their shade or beliefs' 'ir, we
will march forward to vfeitry and
the redemption of this State. [Ap
plause.j I want it distcnctly under
stood that I heave no etliniees to puIn
ish and no friends to reward. lAp
plause.] The gentlemen who op.
posed une to-day, were equally enti
tied to your onfoldeuce. I knew that
so'mebody had to be deprived of the
pulate fot want of the necessary num
her of votes and somebody had to be
nominited, and it so chanced Ithat it
has fallen upon me. There is one
point in regard to the conduct of the
coming campaign, and that is that I
am thoroughly; uttedly and complete
ly opposed to fradd, whethe'r it Eomes
from our side or comes from the oth
er side. I want this electioir to be
square, fair and peaceable. I want
not simply the letter of the law fol
lowed, but also its spirit. I want
every man who Is entitled to vote to
be permitted to do so. I want the
ballot-boxes to be placed where the
spirit of the law intended they should
be pdceed, and where esery citizen
will be able to reach them. I
want every ballot-box to be opened
at the proper time, and that it shall
be accessible to white and black. I
want the ballot-lwboes placed where
everybody ean.sey them. I want the
votes ,dionti~d In the presence of
evethyb'dy;c ind fle returns made in
tie picesena of everybody. We have
a right to ask that, and we shall in
slat that that shall be done. (Ap
iplause.) Nodody can eonplaiun of
that-it id a right which is due to the
othet side and due to us, and we most
eaet it. :Now, genthlemen, whilst
you have conferred upon me a great
Ihonot I feel almost as if I would have
preferd mnot having that hono,, in
fiew of dea very great defcieiney f
my ability to justify your coonfdeote.
If I can scedebd in doing what I knwow
nod waine te'~o'do, ifI can enected
ip rr fiMg what you espect of me,
I will proud tthiat I am yoet repre
e~eiative. If I lhotld fail Midl6gh
lack of pains or want of judgeaent,
or from any other eause tquk6 you
regret your truest, I will look' pon
your nomination to-day a a' jreat

and I will atterut to do what is righit.
