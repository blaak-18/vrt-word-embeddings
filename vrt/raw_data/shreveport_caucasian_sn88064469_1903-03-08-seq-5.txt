all, one of the journals represents the
women inspctors in a state o dclumresand
over devising a costume thbot ill end
able them to perform this perilous feat
osteamer by climbing an iron or rope ladder.
Now look here. I give you herewith a
few cold, hard facts on this question,
and let them settle it. To beghink I my
self in ordinary woman's clumsy and
Inconvenient clothing have boarded a
steamer by climbing a ladder dozens
ofsh times in almost every quarter of
the globe and did not think I was do
ing anything uncommon. Neither did
anybody else. In the tropics and in
the orient women passengers board
ships in that manner every day, be
cause it is the only way. There are
almost no docks built out in the har
bors enabling a passenger to walk
aboard. The steamers at HIongkong,
at Manila, at nearly every one of the
Chinese and Japanese ports, at Co
lombo and Penang-and the list might
be extended indefinitely-anchor a mile
or -two offshore and are reached by
lighters and tenders. At Colombo to
day is a young woman medical inspect
or with her own rowhoat and crew
who boards every incoming steamer
and examines the women passengers.
Along our own Maine coast women
passengers go out to sea to catch
steamers, and once in Bering sea I
heard a steamer captain say, "Well. I
can climb a rope ladder as spry as any
body of this ship unless it is Mrs.
'Blank." So there!
After all, women are queer. An
abandoned wife is suing another wom
an who she says "alienated" her hus
band's affections. The wife whines
and snivels and says: "It's all the fault
of that woman, the wretch! Before
she got hold of him my husband loved
me." Here are two points for the
earnest consideration of deserted
·Wives: First, a husband whose affee
tlIs can be "'alienated'" by anybody
or anything is not worth keeping;'sec
ond, if, nevertheless, a husband does
thus become alienated and his wife
must get even, the husband himself is
the one to "go for, not the woman. He
undoubtedly wanted to be led astray.
But the best way of all to get revenge
on a delinquent husband is to let him
go. Nine times out of ten he will be
awfully sorry he went.

Women are proving themselves ex
cellent advertisement writers. A girl
only sixteen years old who hit on a
new and L amorous idea for a good ad
vertisement is getting $1,500 a year
out of it. Advertisement writing has
btecome a regular occupation that is
now often more lucrative than regular
newspaper work, especially if one can
be humorous and original. It is a
promising field.
Whatever a woman decides to do, if
she takes hold of it with pluck and de
termined perseverance she will win.
Miss Kate E. Griswold, who has be
come well to do through her own dis
tinguished ability and industry in a
field previously occupied by men, had
many obstacles to overcome before she
succeeded. She says, however, to oth
er women,', There is always plenty of
encouragement to go on." So there is.
President Roosevelt, who is so bitter
against childless homes, ought to have
been for a few years a laborer with a
wife and six children to support on a
dollar a day.~ Then he would have
been qualified to speak.
I have seen in a newspaper a letter
frqm a high school girl eomplaining of
the ,8trictnes of the rules she had to
obey and whining over the severity of
the examinations. That girl will never
ammunt to anything. The girl that is
really worth something rises to every
emergency and meets it with a soul
equal to it. Difficult achievements
rengthen uas intellectually.
The president of a great university
sys that marriage is decliing among
educated women because their ideals
at husbands become too high for men
to meet and men feel themselves intel
leitually nferieor to these educated wo
men. Is hot this rather hard on the

Inclined toward love, ideals and all
those nice little things don't let the
men suspect it. Talk golf nonsense,
verse or what you will, only avoid the
slightest approach to sentiment, and
you will soon find things coming your
own wayv"
"But the sentimental woman does
sometimes marry?"
"Alas! yes, but her husband does not
find out about her weakness till after
ward. Then we see a nice household,
with the mother of the family sprawl
ing on a divan reading mushy novels
because real life isn't good enough for
her and the children and household
arrangements going to the dogs in con
sequence. This, of course, is the ex
aggerated type of sentimental woman,
but I was personally acquainted with
one of her kind. She spent her time
reading love stories and whatever
spare money she had in going to see
romantic plays until she lost all her
ambition, her pride in her home and
everything else a woman is supposed
to have. In the end her husband di
vorced her, and even then she didn't
seem to care much, but lounged in a
chair with a box of candy at her elbow
reading her perpetual novel."
"H'm-m! And I suppose she"
"Yes, exactly so. Well, in its lesser
forms sentimentality leads to a wom
an's thinking no one can understand
her, least of all the unfortunate man
who Is her husband. When she is clever
she writes her experiences, and then
we have things like 'The Confessions
of a Wife,' that make you long to
shake the woman. But as a rule the
sentimental woman is not clever. She
contents herself with boring her hus
band ninety times a day with the trite
remark, 'Do you love me?' or else weep
ing and going around the house wear
ing an injured expression."
"I wish," the older woman went on
hastily as If she feared an interrup
tion, "mothers would teach their
daughters that while love is a good
thing it isn't the whole thing; that am
bition, work and success are not mere
masculine attributes. Oh, yes, I know
there are many women who have
found that out already, but there are a
lot more who ought to be helped to find
it out. When we have more ambition
and less analysing among women then
we shall have fewer sentimental wom
en and as a result fewer heartbroken
ones." MAUD ROBINSON.
One Wife's rlt imatm.
A woman left her husband on the
ground that he ill treated her. Finally
she offered to return to him if he would
sign a set of rules she drew up for his
observance. One of them was that he,
should take a itath once a week and
put on clean clothes The husband re
ftsed flatly to sign, and it was all oft
again. The wife was right. A husband
who will not take a bath once a week
and put-on clean clothes ought to live
in a stable.

ful member of the working woi ld up
to near the age of ninety-one, which
she will reach next November. Luck
she never had. In 1830 she was mar
ried to Mir. Louis Goodman. who years
afterward became a helpless invalid
and remained on her hands to be sup
ported till his death in 1870. IHe did
not become an invalid till several chil
dren had been born to the couple, how
ever-worse luck! -and, in addition to
the maintenance of her husband, Mrs.
Goodman had these to rear and edu
cate all alone.
Heredity was indeed in her favor.
She had iu her veins the vital, te
nacious Hebrew blood whose possessor
seldom gives down and whines. But
heredity alone would have availed lit
tle except to enable Julia Salaman
(Goodman to linger long in a poorhouse.
She had noble artistic gifts also and a
wise common sense; best of all the in
domitable will that thus far has kept
her from yielding to the "cowardly
habit of dvine."
Julia Salaman was one of a family
of twelve children, all of them uncom
monly gifted. Their parents educated
them in a practical manner. Julia ran
naturally to painting. She had the
best teacher of the time and adopted
portraiture as her specialty. When
she was thrown on the world with a
husband and children to support, she
naturally and easily took up again the
beloved art which had been her enter
tainment in her fortune favored years.
From that day to this her life has
been one of incessant labor-not grudg
ing, slavish toil, but cheerful, happy
tasks, so happy that you can fairly
hear the joy bells ringing their accom
paniment down along the years all the
way. Mrs. Goodman has naturally
strong power of concentration and she
has cultivated it till it is enormous.
These are the things that have made
her and kept her-noble intellectual
gifts, a strong love nature and a
MRS. JULIA GOODMAN.
splendid will power. Now at ninety
she paints and does needlework with
out glasses, only occasionally using a
magnifying glass for a few of the
more delicate strokes of her brush.
Who, man or woman, can equal such a
record ?
Mrs. Goodman has painted more than
a thousand portraits. Nearly or quite
fifty years ago she began exhibiting
her work in the Royal academy, and
she has kept it up ever since. She has
painted scores of the notable persons
of Great Britain. She has also met so
cially most of those who have helped
make English history in the past two
generations. She has lived with her
working and enjoying faculties unim
paired while five British sovereigns
ruled and four of them passed away.
George III. was king when she was
born; she witnessed the coronation of
George IV.; lived anti wrought while
William IV., then Victoria, reigned
and died-Victoria was seven years
younger than Mrs. Goodman-and now.
in full possession of her artistic pow
ers, the marvelous woman yields alle

It is not for the old girls that I have
been at pains to trace out this life
story, not for those ancient females
who have let active life slide from
their grasp and now sit in a corner and
"take things easy." These are past
praying for. It is for the young girls
I write, those of fourteen and upward.
There is no woman in England more
honored than ninety-year-old Julia
Goodman.

SOME TAILOR AND CREPON WAISTS.
a wiry feel that few ever really liked
it. The mohair now is shown in all
the syndicate colors, and many street
suits are made of it, with all the at
tention to detail shown in the finest
broadcloth. The cream colored mo
hairs are really beautiful when made
up and trimmed with yellowish lace.
Some pretty waists are made by hav
ing Bulgarian embroidery set along the
folds and cuffs, and the funny little tab
collars have the tabs wrought in this
stitch. When the waist is white or a
very light color and the embroidery
is done in black and red or dark blue,
the result is very unique and artistic.
One pretty design in a mohair waist
for a young lady is of the palest blue,
almost white. This is laid in seven
folds in front and five in the back.
These are not stitched on the edges,
but are left open like the slot seams.
Arranged as a yoke across the shoul
ders is fine black brussels net (this, by
the way, is much used in the new
waists), and this is in turn edged with
a pretty design of white renaissance
lace. Across this again are drawn lines
of black ribbon, each end' finished off
with a loon and button.
Another very neat and attractive
waist is of ashen gray mohair, soft,
but shining like the richest silk. This
has a plastron front, opening at the
left side and fastening with frogs and
loops of black silk. A band of black
silk guipure lace is used to trim the
sleeves and the collar, but the cuffs
are ornamented only by two frogs and
loops. I saw this copied in handsome
fine albatross cloth and also in French
broadcloth. French twilled flanne(l, in
a delicate frosty blue, has been also
used to produce the same design. It is
pretty in all.
A waist which is as well adapted for
separate use or as part of a suit is that
shown in the illustration. It is made of
the new crapelike stuff which is so
well liked by all. This stuff is made in
an admixture of colors, and these are
made into stripes by the crinkle in the
weave. It reminds one of the deeply
crinkled india crapes. The colors in
the waists are so closely brought to
gether that the whole is like reseda.
There is a yoke in front made of moss
green velvet, the edges are bordered
with a bias band of silk to match, and
this is studded with small silk buttons.
The bishop sleeves have deep cuffs
trimmed to match the bonder of the
waist. This is a peculiarly gir' 'h waist
and pretty besides.
The very thin waists bid fair to sur
pass any yet - ! in point of beauty.
Such daintiness in workmanship and
fancy is hard to imagine. Fine lace in
sertions and edgings may give an idea
of the material used, but one nmu't
really see the exquisite arrangement of
the medallions and crossbars of lace
as arranged along the front to appreci
ate their delicau , beauty. The way the
lace is treated is such that no matter
how fine it is it will be easy to launder.
A fine batiste waist trimmed with its
complement of lace is so sheer that it
will require a corset waist almost as
delicately fashioined. The linen batistes
show such a bewildering array of em
broidered tracings that ano one could
describe them all. The mode for all
white waists is certainly greater th!en
eve:r before. Each new maker i,,ust
imagine something new, and we get a
marvelous variety. The shapes vary
from the old French bodice form to the
pr.~a.u.ed bloiuse. The Gibson waist
