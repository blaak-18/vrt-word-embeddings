Our Walshington Letter.
W\.tsutiXcT1, 1). C. Oct. 6, 1773.
The Indians who lately left here,
after thliree or four conIferences with
Messis. Hlayes and Schitrz, received
eachl a little nl'ceslary clothing, a
trunl'lk and a few dollars in tllney,
''Thse thliings they will take back with
them tth to tlci'r rihes and if the war=
tlois ar not tecrificed at the stie!ngth
andl aima zedl at the glenerosity of ti
goiverlnmeiit which can thus loosely
scaitter its wealth, we in our tuin will
lie astonished. Serihuinly, if tbet~e
was any occasion for the comitng of
these savages, or any gooud wias, to be
expected fronm the visit, it was Io be
found in the opportunity offered for
ilressing upon tlhem, nind through
them upon their people, the lpower of
the Government. Whether a thir
teen dollar trunk atid a slap shhap
overcoat will dto this or not is yet to
be seen.
The Government is nder g're at
disadvantages in its inltercourse with
these people. While ialways making
treaties with them, it never is seen
that the Indians, even if they wish to
observe the tleatiies, undierstalnd their
provisions, Their wishes or ideas
canl be made known only through in
terpreters who, as found in conllnec
ltion with the Intdian riibes are usualI
ly ignorianit andi corrupt. 'Tlhece is
lnot al mail of standing in the service
otfthe Government who knows an
Indian langullage' as spoken, froi the
chatter of a palircel of monlkeys. 'Thel
expense of life and treasure entailed
~by our relation with them, is so enor
moius that all concede that we must
adapt some new method of treatment.

Randall conies to-day, Cox, who is

Smemlibiers here are generally of the

o One Georgia member, Blunt, thinks
lie will be nominated without serious
C opposition In caucus. This caucus,
is by lihe way, will be held on the l3th
