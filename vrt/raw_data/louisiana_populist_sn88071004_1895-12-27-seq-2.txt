'ol:tical Effect of Education.
Among the niany beneficiont of
fects of education is its tendency
to elevate the morals and broaden
the lpwrception of the human mind.
This has a marked effect on
men's political tendencies. It leads
to the heroic treatment of all po
litical diseases ; to patriotic mo
tives actuating, and independent f
thought directing political act ion.
Take for example portions of
our own beloved State ; Our city
of Ruston is noted as the city of
conventions. Great political, edi
torial, religious and educational
conventions with all their educa
tional influence have been held
there year after year. The Lou
isiana Chatauqua with its wonder
ful Tabernacle of five thousand
seats and other facilities, with a
corps of teachers of State reputa
tion and the best lecturers from all
over the nation, is here and has
been shedding its effulgent rays of
wisdom into the neighboring for
ests of ignorance for several years
with remarkable effect. Here also
is the State Industrial School with
a splendid troupe of educators who
are teaching, free of charge, the
children from the humblest walks
of life. The Ruston College is a
local institution of high merit and
is adding no little to the good
work of enlihghtenment. Three I
newspapers also affect the onward
movement, the Progressive Age,
which as its name indicates is pull
ing straight ahead in front of the
movement, the other two, if we
have been correctly informed, hold
ing back to old ruts and antiquated
ideas.
This beautiful little city is situa
ted in the parish of Lincoln, where
it is shedding its light of wisdom,
reforn and progress, and for two
successive elections now, the par
ish has gone Populist by over 5400
majority.
The good work of education is
not even confined to that immedi
ate parish, but has spread into the
adjoining parish of Jackson and
Union, and carried them Populist
by very large majorities.
Then here is our own beloved
Normal School, in a city which is
justly celebrated for the culture
and refinement of its peopje, and
for ten years this great school,
hacked by an appreciative and opn
fident constituency, managed by
a more that State-renowned edu
cator, and the use of an ample
supply of public funds, this insti
tution has shed its light over the
ancient city and the rich and pow
erful parish, until to-day the old
parish--a State within itself
stands proudly on its record in the
battle against ignorance and old
fogyism with 500 majority for the
People's party one year ago.
Truly education is the handmaid
of progress, virtue and human
happiness.

The national executive committee

Hia, soretarie
Read the proceding of our conm
mitLee meeting to use ifyou rre a
elegate, and get ready to attemd
thei conventa. Every delegate
is expected to go.
'This is daristmus week, and we
mhave done but little writing, but
wa hae-are6ly excerpted the
vrw6 (dtataenporares on most
of theleading questions before ms,
tud a very unearly exprmaed
our 1hws.
f.you ib as.cay dollar, re
memh rtLaie ~o.ratm;
lunder a hoadin "f.in,
which really meant aluse, arro
gance and pleading, the Enterprise
of 12th inst. launches upon the
journalistic sea about the same
kind, quality and number of words
with which it is usually fille , bo
rating us for having left, prophe
sying endless misfortune to us for
opposing a tricky Democratic suf
frage amendment, says we are dy
ing out, and all that kind of rot,
and finally comes to what it wants
to say, "come back."
When our sires were members
of the Democratic party it was'
truly a decent one; its principles
were good, its leaders pure, its vo
ters honest, but when the Dlemoc
racy, led by unprincipled scoun
drels, as to-day posing as attributes
of everything good, grand and no
ble, when corruption became a
synonim for Democrary, and the
fundamental principles of "The
voice of the people," were discard
ed, "Like father, like son," we
wished to belong only to the pure
party, and the only way to do so
was to organize one, accordingly
we left the democratic mire for
those who chose to wallow in its
scum and filth, and to-day stand
opposed to ring-rule, corruption,
and fraud-the essential elements
of Democracy, with nothing to re
proach ourselves for except we
happened to have been born a Dem
ocrat.
T'is true that some of our sires
held office under the old regime,
but as value received was in all
instances given, no one can conm
plain.
The majority of men in the
Populist ranks redeemed this State
in "'78" and are now ready and
willing to do the same in '"',)."
The suffrage amendment is an ap
proach ulxn dangerous ground,
and no sensible man will confer,
as it proposes to do, the right of
the next General Assembly to
change what the people have vo
ted-if any change is made let the
whole thing be referred to the
voters.
The selected few, the minority
rule, from Maryland to Texas will
be broken, and your Democrary
having accomplished a mission,
will sink into oblivion, unwept.
It rests with the sons of former
Democrats to restore to its pris
tine purity under the name of tPeo
ple's Party, the principles for
which our sires contended and were
they here to-day, with us they
woul I stand.
History will soon record the last
of a party that has been of late
years a national disgrace, and a
blot upon the politics of A merica,
that of Democracy, and also note
that a pure healthy party has re
placed what was the party of our
fathers.
Tbhe Other Tlket.
Never in the whole history of
Louisiana has there been afforded
a finer opportunity than the pres
ent for the good people to unite
upon a State ticke& to beat the
machine. Fosterism is an eye
sore;it is obnoxious to all who
love what is pure in government.
It stands for fraud and pretense.
It stands for municipal jobbery
and thievery.
Much depends upon the compo
sition of the ticket yet to be put in
the field. There was never a time
when the people were looking more
to the personnel and less to the
partisanship of tickets. Honest
voters want honest men in otfice,
and they do not care muoh for the
party label.
Those who amre considering the
way in which the antt-Foster State
ticket shall be framed should take
counsel from The Item. Put no
old-time backs at any party on it;
put no men on it with records that
can be attacked. Steer clear of
men with over-weenin* ambition.
Let moral cowards alone. Nom
inmate good, clean, straight, bold
men, and thousands of voters will
rush to the support of the ticket
a a happy relief from Fosterism,
Party ties rest lightly on the
shoulders of men these days. Give
m a good ticket, sad the honest
peopto will elect it.-N. O. Daily

Democratic Record nla Brief.
Prior to 1841 the Democrats do
nated to railroads o:',420,)29 acres
of land.
Later congress granted millions
of acres to the Union Pacific, and
only two I)ernocrats voted against
it.
Nat:onal banks were rechartered
in 1xs',, and no Democrat has ever
introduced a bill to rleal this
charter.
Only "one Democrat voted against
the contraction act by which mil
lions of groenbacks were burnt up
and interest-bearing bonds issued
in their place.
Seven Democrats voted to repeal
the income tax mn 1867. If they
had voted the other way the bill
could not have passed.
In 1873 the Democrats assisted
the Republicans in demonetizing
silver and in 1893 the Republicans
helped the Democrats to do the
same thing.
In 1886 a free coinage bill would
have passed if 68 Democrats had
not voted against it.
The McKinley bill has been de
nounced by every Denocratic pa
per and speaker in the land, and
the Wilson bill which has recently
palssed the house "is a miserable
makeshift." Give them more time.
In 1877 they loaned the whisky
ring the tax on liquor stored in
warehouses. and only 18 Demo
crats voted against it. Still it is
unconstitutional to loan the farmer
money on his cotton.
If the record that the Demo
crats have made and are now ma
king is not enough to drive every
man who loves his family out of
the party, then nothing will do
it-Exchange.
