THE CRY OF THE “CAGEN”
CHILDREN.
Julia Lester Dillon.
“Teacher, me and Pierre stop
school now.”
“When? Why do you have to
leave, when you are doing so well?”
“My father, he say we have to
work in the corn flel’!”
“Yes, Edouard, you are large
enough to work in the field, but not
little Pierre.”
“But, yes, he stan’ in the row, and
wave his arms and then the birds
don’t come.”
“Why doesn’t your father make a
straw man, to scare away the birds?
That is the way the farmers do in
Georgia.”
“Don’t know,” he answered, shak
ing his head, “all the children that
can’t hoe corn, have to stand in the
field and shoo the birds away. They
eat all the corn we plant.”
The finality in his tones was dis
couraging and still more dishearten
ing was the thinning of the ranks,
as day after day the children were
taken away, until only a corporal’s
guard was left. School was not to
be considered when the crop was in
question.
It is springtime. The cold winds
that have swept the prairies have
been driven away by the warm
breath of the south wind and all the
earth is awake. The apple-blossoms
have opened their eyes and, answer
ing to the gentle zephyrs, have
dropped their petals of white. The
peach and pear trees have also blos
somed and budded.
The wild vines which festoon the
woodlands along the bayous have
rioted their gorgeous colors and the
purple of the wistaria, and the or
ange of the cross-vine, have given
way to the white fragrance of the lo
cust and the wide-open faces of the
wild white roses that line the road
ways.
The birds flaunt their gay colors
in the faces of every passer-by, and
every hedge of the Cherokee roses is
.aflame with cardinals and aglow with
orioles. The robins and the blue
birds sing and sing, and every tree
top has its chorus of feathered song
sters all glad to be alive.
The grass is gay with blossoms,
and on every side joy seems to be the
keynote of life.
In the midst of this beauty of na
ture, this song of triumphant glad
ness at earth’s awakening, there
comes a minor strain—a chord so
plaintive and so sad that the light
is turned to darkness and the joy
into sorrow. The songs of the birds
are scarcely to be heard for the
cries of the children in the air.
These children of the “habitants,”
called in the patois “Cagens” of
southwestern Louisiana.
Across the black soil of the fields
the men have gone with their plows
and harrows. This done, the call is
• the children to come into the
fields. The school days for the year
are over.
Into the furrows they must go.
Little bare-foot boys and bare-foot,
delicate girls. If it is not to scatter
the seeds or to carry the hoe, it is to
stand all day long and watch the
rows to see that the birds do not

eat the scattered seeds. Truly,, it is
unbelievable but true. Children
taking the place of scare-crows.
The heart of the nation has been
stirred by the tale of the “Man with
the Hoe”; is it not far more pitiable
to know of the “Children in the
Row?”
Along the long lanes of corn they
must go, from early morn till late
eve, chop, chop, chopping, or else,
watch, watch, watching, all the day.
If they are allowed to go to school,
they must do the day’s work in the
fields just the same—either before
the school begins in the morning or
after it closes in the afternoon, or at

' SERENADE '
By Henry Tirnrod
Hide, happy damask, from the stars,
What sleep enfolds behind your veil,
But open to the fairy cars
On which the dreams of midnight sail;
And let the zephyrs rise and fall
About her in the curtained gloom,
And then return to tell me all
The silken secrets of the room.
Ah, dearest! may the elves that sway
Thy fancies come from emerald plots,
Where they have dozed and dreamed all day
In hearts of blue forget-me-nots.
And one perhaps shall whisper thus:
Awake ! and light the darkness, Sweet!
While thou art reveling with us,
A He watches in the lonely street. u

both times. This is the price they
pay for education.
The long hot days of summer
come on apace. Then the cotton has
to be freed from weeds. The schools
have been kept open through the
warmest months of summer to ac
commodate these helpless little ones,
but it is of no avail, not so can they
be shown the better way.
The sun shines too bright, the heat
is too fierce, neither teacher nor pu
ils can do good work under such cir
cumstances, and so the verdict has
gone forth. No more schools for the
rural children in the summer time.
The few, therefore, who were willing
to make the sacrifice, may not do so
again. "
Why not have the school in the
fall? That is the time for the best
school work everywhere. Not so,
here. This is the busiest time of the
year. Into the fields the children go.
Out into the fields, where the cotton
is white unto the harvest, and it is
pick, pick, pick, that the world may
be clothed.
It is pick, pick, that the men who
buy cotton may wax gross, and live
in luxury; that the mills may have
I51)e Jeffersonian
cotton to spin into thread; that other
children may have bobbins to fill and
cloth to weave and be bound down in
the close places as these are in the
open.
The weary feet, the numbed
brains, the aching hearts of the
the farmers’ children are not put
down in the ginners’ reports. The
government statistics make no men
tion of this tax upon the nation’s
future. Sometimes, somewhere,
there will be a reckoning, and the
debt will be paid.
The homes from which these
children come are as their forefath
ers were three hundred years ago.
An unassimilated part of the popula
tion, the “habitants” or “Cagens”
live the life of the Arcadians of the
eighteenth century. Their language
is a patois. Their customs of life
and of social intercourse are fixed
by the laws of that time. Their
lives are as narrow. They have no
history. They know no traditions.
They have neither books, papers, pic
tures, or. music. Their fathers spoke
French, ate cous-cous, drank coffee,
and raised cotton, and children —
principally children, and so will they.
What does the future hold for
them? Nothing, absolutely. Their
outlook is far more shadowy than
that of their brothers in black. They
have been aroused. They want to
learn and the schools are waiting for
them, and crowded to their doors.
Not so, these little white slaves
of the prairies, the bayous and con
fess of Louisiana. They will fol
low in the footsteps of their fathers
and live and die in perfect ignorant
contentment, knowing only their
limited three hundred words of Ca
jun patois—while the world spins
merrily on.
The children of the slums hear
the church bells ring, watch the
endless procession of the city’s life,
their wits are sharpened by the
steady contact with other wits, even
though they are slaves to the grind
of the whirring wheels. For them
there are night classes, industrial
schools, settlement homes, constant
effort to reach them and help them
up and out.
As yet, the world's great heart is
closed and that tightly, to the cry of
these children of the corn and cot
ton fields. Because they are under
the blue sky does not make them im
mune to the rays of the burning sun.
There are beauties manifold all
around them, but their eyes are
blinded and only the grossness of
nature is seen, and cared for. To
the fields they have followed in the
footsteps of their father, and work
done, again they follow his lead to
find pleasures, and to the corner gro
cery they go.
When the clouds hang heavy over
head and the fields lie too sodden
and wet for work, through all the
passing hours of the day, and far
into the night, they watch the fall
of the greasy, dirty cards. “Le rouge
et le noir,” it is that spells beauty
and happiness and joy to them. Too
often the price of a season’s work
will go from one hand to another,
lost on the turn of a card, or the
throw of the dice. Then the year’s
hard labor is gone for naught, and
the dreary winter’s night falls, with
out the solace of even a comforting
thought. Gamblers at heart, a
shrug of the shoulders and it is for
gotten—even so, the wives and chil
dren, for their work is gone too.
Glowing sunsets and fleecy clouds,
the magic play of light and shade
along the surface of the bayous,
the fascinating sweep of the bound
less horizon of the prairies, have no
charm for their sightless eyes. The
music of a wheezy accordeon, or a
screaking violin, if it is a tune to
which their feet can keep time, is
far more entrancing than all the
heaven-attuned -choirs of the tree
tops. Blind and deaf they are to all
God’s beauteous world.
They know but one master, father.
His will is law, and the law of his
life is the crop. Laws have been
passed regulating the hours of work
in the factories that nation’s chil
dren may be saved.
Who is there to say to these ig
norant Frenchmen of the prairies,
“we must save your children for
you, and for our country?”
One bale of ten-cent cotton is of
far more value in their eyes than
the boys and girls doomed to the
same depths of sin and ignorance in
which they live, all unconscious of
its degradation.
The educators are trying to help
by compulsory education. They are
in earnest and zealous in their ef
forts to reach them, and lift them
out of their bonds of slavery, but
it will be a hard fight and none can
foretell the result.
The question resolves itself into
this one of economics, a certain
dime this year, against a possible
dollar in the future —the children
pay the price.
