-For the VaxnrcAsro
Bandom Thougts, on My 70th Birth
Day. T
BY W. C. J.
"Extremum hune, Mea msan, inihi corn
cede laborem."
And am I old ?-it cannot be,
The heart yet throbs so strong,
It loves the sheen of beauty's e'e, A1
It loves it's smile and song. h
True, years have come, and years have o
fled, 8
But what can years avail,
The roses' heart can never fade, ti
Until it's petals pale. h
But ah ! Idream, time's withering blast, e
So oft has come and flown te
That by it's chill and blighting waste,
Youth's joys are past and gone.
Ah, yes, I dream, and 'tin a dream,
And as I dream, I sigh,
O'er scenes on memory's silver stream, 0
Of days and years gone by.
But most of one whose trusting heart, a
She gave with inaiden's love, s
And acted out, the noblest part: a
That woman's heart can prove.
Fancy then saw no autumn blight.
Spread o'er life's coming years,
Bright were its pictures, and its tight
Passed thro' no oloud of tears.
I've lived thr√Ω' life's sweet, billteous
spring,
It's summer fruits and flow
When hopes, like bird were oMhe wing, I
And golden were the hours. 
But autumn, with its blight has come,
With yellow leaf and sere,
And as fond memories backward roam,
The past is doubly dear.
Swift years have come, swift years have
lied,
And carried to the dust,
The living, loving, to the dead,
Those loved and cherished most.
A dream, a deam, 'tis all a dream,
A sad weird dream, forsooth!
But old as I am, and old as I seem,
The heart is still in it's youth.
The wrinkles-tell me that I am old,
And the locks so bleached and grey.
And the once warm current, now slow
and cold
Tell me, I'm old to-day.
Oh life! mere prelude to the grave,
A meteor flash at most,
A bubble on an ocean wave,
A moment, and 'tis lost.
But oh I what is that moment worth?
That moment e're it flies,
Life only buds upon the earth,
To bloom above the skies.
Onr life has only one sweet May,
When all is song-and flowers,
But ah I how soon it flits away,
Upon the swift winged hours.
Soon fades the lovely crimson gem,
That throws its sweets abroad,
It pales upon its parent stem,
Tho' painted by it's God.
But yet again returns it's bloom,
To Him, by whom 'twas given,
Flies back to it's.own native home,
And gives it's blush to Heaven.
Thus may this heart, with no vain fear,
Pass to it's pulseless rest.
And die, as gently dies the star,
Upon the morning's breast.
Thus may my spirit, when it wings,
Its flight to realms above,
Bathe ever in the pafailing springs,
Of God's unhaoggign ovoe.
