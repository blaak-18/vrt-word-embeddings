i'HS GIN has been in se for the st ca
Sthree iaisons, and several recent imt- ful
proveiments have been added.. It obvi- am
ates all friction at the ends of the cotton
box, prevents the roll from braking, and
gives a LARGER YIELD OF LINT from cod
the same amount of. Seeti than any other
Gin in use. The Revolving lentI light
one the draft apd causes the Guin to run ha
faster with less driving power, ths do.
ing a great deal more work within the
same time, while economising steam or fa(
animal power, than any other Gin. The Sol
seed bein ginned very close, the length
of the staple is increaspd; 1*oulcing cot- mi
ton on this aceoWnl 6T a greater market tin
value. This improved value, given by ce
length of staple; with extra production
of lint, added to increased amount of alt
woolP done, more than covers the cost in
of l'he Gin in every 100 bales ginned.

and parochial canvass, on the eve of at t
an election, ivirol'ng thb denrest that
rightA of I~reenien, and it is necessary eves
dow
that every voter should fully under
stand and appreciate the vital qnes
tions brought home to him ; questions .n.
that iinst be met and answered as divy
becomes men of nerve and intelli
the
genee. For years we have been
striving to defeat the. anrch-iienmy,
Radicalism,. in this State and now that iqul
brol
the day of our deliverance is dawning, rot
and hIope once fled, returning to hcer r .
us on, every man who loves good and Ithal
honest government whether he he .
black' or white,,dich or poor, sholld a
be willing to give practical evidence gesl

prejudice, personal animosities, and dpl'

The Saint Louis conventipn, though haT
passed and gone has left it work be- the
hind, and the noble etanip e of the fror
men tlihre assembled who were ac- unt
tiiated by the highest feelings of love pali
and fidelity to tieit country and con- you
stituency, was most faithfully imita- tiom
ted by the geptlemen who composed trilu
the Baton Rouge Convelhion, for fait
their work~4as found a sympathetic nli,
throb in every honest heart that beats saci
in unison with the hope of seeing our prt
beloved State of Louisiana witested enr
from the hands of the spoiler, They the
met, and upon the alter of their coun-i
try they laid all personal feelings and fits
private aspirations, every emotion of a b
of a selfish nature. was subdued, and
i with the bright hope f a glorious
victory, men wero placed upon the
ticket who have called farth peans
of praise from friends and f6e. There
was not a discordant element, not a 1
heart-buhn' in either e'onvention, and ing
no dissatisfaction expressed by a r
single man. Those witd had not cnl
