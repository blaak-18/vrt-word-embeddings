rs usually strong is the present cast. L

finery telegraphed to parties in Laf

Should be Stopped.
The Gazette's attention has been
called to the way in which the west
bbund passenger train blockades
nearly all the street crossing. This
train stops at this station twenty
mimutes and during that time vehi- te
cles are very much inconvenienced.
There is no necessity for this pract '
tice by the railroad officials; it is
simply a piece of carelessness on
their part and the town authorities
should see that it is stopped.
Marvelous Results.
From a letter written b'y Rev. J. Gunder- ti
man, of D)imondale, Mich., we are permit- S
ted to make this extract: "I have no hesita
lion in reco:nmending I)r. King's New
Discovery, as the results were almost mar- w
velous in the cse of my wife. While I
was pastor of the lRabtist Church at Rives
Junction she was brought down with to
Pneumonia succeeding La Grippe. Ter-
rible paroxysms of coughing would last tC
hours with little interruption and it seemed
as if she could not survive them. A
friend recommended 1)r. King's New li(
I)sicovery; it was quick in its stork and R
highly satisfactory in results" Trial bottles

If all reports relative to the failure to
of the Ferris refineries are true, the
whole transaction stands out in a
most malodorous plight, which re
flects small credit on the manage- pl
ment. This, in connection with the w
statement of Mr. Ferris himself that tl
t the failure in no way effects his indi
vidual. financial standing, gives some lc
foundation to the tugly charges the I
creditors of the concern have made. fi

The result of deceptiorx is no
better illustrated than in the great
est of all comedies "Jane" which
comes to the Lafayette Opera
House next.Sunday night, January
20. To know that the prodigal
protege mistepresents to his guar
dian that he is married, and that
nis wife's extravagance causes him
to draw heavily on his fortunes
while in reality he does it to pay
:cat
his gambling debts, and the untinme
ly arrival of the guardian, who S'
comnes to see the wife, place the on
young spendthrift in a position that
can hardly be acceptable, especially
as he desires that the guardian must
not know that he has been deceiv- rj1
ing him, and to carry out his decep
tion it will be necessary to present
his wife and offspring to the guar
dian. The predicament of the
young ;nan can be imagined. But
at the last moment, Jane, his pretty
housemaid, comes to his assistance
and arranges matters so that she
will act the part of a wife to him
during the stay of the guardian.
SJane however is seciretly married to T'.
her master's valet, who is so jealous
Sand irritable that dluring the visit of
