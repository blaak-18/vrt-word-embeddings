read it and prize it above all other
books.
I am' the girl who advocates every
one of Watson’s principles. I think
those who are not Watson’s advo
cates are not to be claimed as true
Americans.
I gm glad to know that Bryan
didn’t get elected, but surely believe
Watson could fill the President’s
office as well as Roosevelt or Taft.
I am working to get more subscrib
ers to get more of his books. My
school teacher is reading it, and
says “She must have one, no mat
ter what the cost may be.” She
also says that she wants every pupil
she has to read and study it.
With thanks and best wishes to
The Jeffersonians, I remain your
true friend,

USUAL FRAUD PRACTICED.
Crawfordville, Ga.
My Dear Mr. Watson: I want to
say to you that, as usual, fraud was
• practiced at our last election. I at
first was astounded at the amount of
votes cast for the Populist candidate,
but when I learned of the fraudulent
methods used that accounts for it all.
My precinct went solid for you with
the exception of one man, but an ad
joining precinct that had nothing but
Democratic managers did some dirty
work. Two Pops came in early that
morning to vote. They called for
Populist tickets. The managers told
them they had none; that they had
only two tickets, a Democratic and
an Independent. But that did not
satisfy the boys. So they still de
manded a Populist ticket. Finally
some were brought out. They voted
and went away. And later in the day
came three others and demanded
Populist tickets. They were told the
same story over. We have but two
tickets. So they got no Populist
ticket at all and went away.
It does look like there ought to be
away to punish such rascals. I think
at least they should be exposed.
Your most sincere friend,
I. S. CHAPMAN.
ONE MORU OF THE OLD GUARD
GONE.
Gilbert Williams, of Salem, 111.,
passed away on the 26th of Decem
ber. He grew up in Marion
county, Illinois. He was one of the
leaders of the People’s Party. He
was known throughout Illinois, being
in the reform movement since the
days of Peter Cooper. He was a man
that kept posted on the issues of the
day; he was always on the side of the
people. He was about sixty-seven
years old, and was one of the boys to
enlist in the war of the sixties in
General Grant’s regiment and served
until the close of the war.
In the death of Brother Williams
we have lost a good citizen and neigh
bor, and the family have lost a kind
husband and father. He leaves a
widow and eight children, five sons
and three daughters, all of them be
ing grown. The funeral was today,
the 28th day of December, 1908.

'Roosebelt's Place In History
If President Roosevelt should dis
appear entirely from public life after
his present term of office expires,
what place would he occupy in the
future history of our country?
Hero worshippers, who usually
form conclusions without any regard
to existing facts, and who now look
upon Roosevelt as a demigod, would
no doubt give him a very high place.
But the blind hero worshippers of
Roosevelt are not so numerous as
they were a year or so ago; many
have begun to analyze the real Roose
velt, to compare his public utterances
with his official acts, and in doing so
they become amazed at the contra
dictions that present themselves.
The President’s recent message to
Congress, like several proceeding ones,
was more a sermon to the people
than a message to Congress. The
President seems to either take it for
granted that the only way he can
reach Congress is to stir up the peo
ple and through them Congress, or
he takes that method of playing to
the galleries. The former would be
the most charitable view to take of
it, but when the high ideals of public
and private life contained in his ser
mons and speeches are compared with
many of his official acts, it is almost
impossible to credit the President
with entire sincerity.
That the President’s sermons have
done a power of good is beyond ques
tion. The influence of the high ideals
in public and private life so admira
bly presented by the President, and
his severe condemnation of the wrong
doer, has largely tended to elevate
the standard from which all public
and private acts should be gauged.
This influence will continue to mani
fest itself for many years to come,
notwithstanding the many contradic
tions between his sermons and his
official acts.
With apparent sincerity the Presi
dent often repeats that no wrong
doer should be shielded or protected,
and yet how many times during the
last few years have we proof that
the protecting arm of the President
did shield some favored wrong-doer!
The power of the trusts, corporations,
and the rich, must be curbed, is one
of Roosevelt’s pet phrases, but he
personally enlarged the power of the
United States Steel corporation, ex
alted a repudiated Senator in Wis
consin to a United States judges'll,p,
turned a deaf ear to every progressive
leader in his own party, and urged the
passage of an asset currency measure;
which gave the rich more power than
any currency law passed by any Con
gress since the declaration of inde
pendence.
The Philadelphia North American,
after clearly pointing out the evils of
the law and denouncing it as the most
vicious currency bill ever passed by
Congress, excused the President upon
the ground that in matters of finance
he was a mere infant, and was mis
led by his advisers. But neither the
President or any other public man
can rightfully plead ignorance to the
main fundamental principles involved
in any currency legislation. Those
principles are that the power to con-
ZSfoa Jeffersonian
trol the volume of our circulating
mqpey is a government function, too
dangerous, and too far-reaching to
safely delegate it unreservedly, as
this law did, to any class of citizens.
Thus we see the messages, sermons
and speeches of the President brim
ful of high ideals in governmental
legislation, and proper restrictions
upon the rich and powerful, but most
of his official acts have been a direct
contradiction to those high ideals, in
fact he has enlarged the power of the
trusts and corporations, and would
further enlarge that power by urging
the repeal of the most important fea
tures of the Sherman anti-trust law.
Through asset currency legislation he
has made it possible for the rich and
powerful to exact more tribute from
the masses whenever they see fit to
turn the screws.
In fact, the contradictions between
the President’s sermons and his offi
cial acts are so clearly manifested,
that if he should disappear from pub
lic life after next March, the un
biased historian would be compelled
to say that: Theodore Roosevelt,
twenty-sixth President of the United
States, was chiefly noted for his ideal
sermons to the masses, while officially
acting for the classes.

READY TO SHOUT FOR WATSON.
Lavonia, Ga., Nov. 27, 1908.
Hon. Tlios. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: As the election
is over I will write you a few lines.
In the 1117th district, Hart county,
the vote was very small, Watson 27,
Taft 13 and Bryan 10, and the Taft
vote was really yours, as the people
brook, says he is sure you got the
Watson, but for fear Bryan would be
elected a lot of people voted for Taft.
One of my neighbors, Mr. Joe F. Hol
brook, says he is sure you got the the
cream of Georgia.
Well, as I have been following after
you for the last twenty years, I am
proud to know that you are leading
the balancing power of the State, and
I hope to see you holding all the
power in the near future. I am one
of the many that knows we could get
reform through you as a leader (and
you only), and you will always find
me ready to shout for Watson. I
think we need organization. If we
were organized I think we would rule
some day. I have heard a lot of men
say they thought you were the only
one that offered any reform at all.
In conclusion, will say that I great
ly enjoyed your editorial in The
Jeffersonian the first issue after the
election. I have loaned my paper to
several. With best wishes to you. I
am with you always.

HEARD NO COMPLAINT.
Soperton, Ga., Nov. 26, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson.
Dear Sir and Friend: I have not
heard from this county all over. While
I furnished some other precincts with
tickets, and I went to my precinct
before polls opened and was there all
day, I believe We held them down very
well at Soperton, Watson was not
talked much, Bryan only beat you
two votes in Soperton. Bryan got 52,
and Watson 50, and Taft 69, while to
my knowing several Democrats voted
for Taft. While I expect Montgomery
county is about as weak as you have
in Georgia, we stuck to them in Soper
ton.
Yours until the victory for justice
and right is won,
J. T. S., “POPULIST.”
BELIEVES OUR PRINCIPLES
RIGHT.
Fayetteville, Tenn.
Hon. T. E. Watson:
My subscription for both of your
publications began with the beginning
of each. I admire your style, and be
lieve the principles of the People’s
Party are right. I am glad you are
not discouraged and that you propose
to continue the fight, and keep the flag
floating. I admire your pluck. I say,
let us fight on; fight forever for that
which we think is right, and ever re
sent that which we think is wrong. In
the last three national campaigns I
have been the Populist elector for the
sth district of Tennessee.
Yours in the faith,
H. T. CHILDS.
