Uncle Sam's
Big Game
Preserves
[Special Correspondence.?
Lander, Wyo., Feb. 24.--At least in
point of airea, Uncle Saul has the lar
gest zoo in the world, though there are
others into which are huddled a greater
variety of animal life. This is the Yel
lowstone National park, embracing
3,As)O square miles, whe'e roam at will
uncounted herds of wild animals in
digenous to the country-buffalo. elk,
deer, antelope and the like.
The Yellowstone park is an ideal and
unique big game preserve, and as there
is no open season here, the animals are
safe from the huntsman, becoming ab
solutely fearless of injury from man.
Although they are as wild as the wild
est mountain forest can produce, every
species knows to a nicety the boundary
of the preserve and keeps within it.
Even the timid deer have lost their
sense of fear and the noise of a dis
charging gun has no terror for them.
It is not an unusual thing to see a
group of them grazing within a few
rods of a posthouse or hotel, apparent
ly satisfied that no harm can come to
them under Uncle Sam's protecting
care. The firing of the sundown gun
a twelve pounider-will not cause them
to stop munching the bunch grass
which they have kicked up under the
snow. But the hauling down of the
flag will attract their curious attention
much more than the noise of the gun.
The park is patrolled thoroughly by
the government to prevent the shooting
of the animals. Two troops of cavalry
are divided into single scouts and pa
trol the 3,000 square miles of the park
constantly, and as the years go by and
this plan is continued the game comes
to know and not to fear its human pro
tectors. Poachers receive fair trial be
fore a United States judge, but if it ap
pears that they are on the reservation
for the purpose of destroying the game
they are dealt with in accordance with
the severe laws provided. -.
Public sentiment among the residents
surrounding the park has been awak
ened, and their sympathies, which at
first seemed not to be favorable to the
plan of game preservation, have now
become thoroughly in liarmony with
the intent of the government.
Under these wise provisions the
numbers of each species have greatly
increased until now the park is full

of big game, making it a very para
dsre for the hunter, if he .were only
permitted to hunt However, he'ean
only look on in wonder and with such
pleasure as a true sportsman can feel
it the passive contemplation of what
would be a splendid shot.
In late' years black and brown bears
have been increasing in numbers and
Can be seen at any time feeding on the
gafbage piles at the camp posts and ho
tels. These bears are perfectly harmd
less so long as therJar' kept in a wild
state, but when they are fed and pet
ted, as some of them have been in the
past, they lose all fear of human bl
lags and ate liable to do considerable
damage to property and provisions.
They are also liable to frighten tour
ists bty following them with the expec
tatlop of being fed. Several of the
black and brown bears that had been
too thoroughly civilized had to be killed
last. summer because of their sociable
instincts.
One of the most interesting experi
meatswhftch are being condeucted in the
Yellowstone park at present is the en
deavor to raise buffaloes. At the last
session of -ongrdes $15,000 was appro
priated in a bill for the purpose of pro
vidan n an inelosure and securing a
small herd of buffaloes. This intention
on the part of the national legislators
has been carled out, the inclosure has
been provided and a small herd estab
I d within it. The buffaloes are ap
parently doing well, and as theeherd in
ereases they will be given the freedom
of the entire park.
In the matter of fishing the policy of
the government is less restrictive than
iahunting. Trout fishing i allowed in
the park, and in the clear lakes and
mountain streams much fine sport can
be had. That there ma; be no cessa
tion to this sport it has been recom
niended that a smnall fish hatchery shall
bees ablished In the park. Seven mil
i1on black Spotted trout were hatched
in Yellowstone lake last season.
Yellowstone park has been aptly des
ignated "the wonderland of the United
States" and is year by year attracting
tourist in increasing numbers. Con
gre has began to realise the worth of
this -game reservation, and the appro
priatio.s which have been made dur
tag te past few.years have been such
as to permit of many improvements to
the parkt which were greatly needed.
