SThe failing of leaves from the trees
and the chill of the air at morning and
evening strongly suggest the approich
of winter and remind us that the end of
the world's fair is at hand. In another
month the fire on the hearth, will be
gin to feel good and the heater and the
furnace will have been put in readi
ness for the winter season. With all
this in view the departing verdure of
the trees and plants becomes still more
attractive to us. and we are loth to part
with the sweetness and beauty of the
fading flowers, and we regret the time
lost among other attractions of the
great fair.
As the summer season has faded
into autumn the delicate blossoms
of the tropical plants have disappeared,
the more hardy beauties of colder
climes have come to gladden the eyes
SASHINGTON BACK YARD.
of the lovers of nature, and the busy
gardeners and attendants of the horti
cultural department have had their
hands full in changing the plants as
their respective seasons opened and
closed.
True. the average visitor takes little
heed of these things le casts an ad
miring glance at the bright blossoms 1
and with a hurried sniff at their sweet
odor and the commonplace remark:
'Yes, very pretty," bolts away to vi
sions of more practical and prosaic 1
things. But there are those who love
to linger among the fragrant flowers
and who note with sorrow the fading
glories of the beautiful t1 wer beds
about the Horticultural building and
on the wooded island. here all summer I
long have bloomed some of the choicest I
and rarest exotics ever seen in this
country. With the changing months a

tile reigning beauties of the garden and
hot-house have held sway each in turn
giving place to the other as its appro
priate period came and went, and now
that the chilling hand of winter is
stretched forth to seize them in its icy
grasp they are being uprooted and con
veyed to the preserving warmth of the
conservatories.
It has been said by exacting indivil
uals that in the respect of flowers and
plants the exposition has been sadly
lacking, and it has been remarked by
thoughtless persons that it wasn't
worth while to erect so handsome and
extensive a structure as is the Iforticul
tural building for so meager a display
as is contained therein. Such com
ments could emanate but from callous
and inexperienced persons who have no
knowledge of the infinite labor that
-,

has been expended in this department
to bring it to the very high state of per
fection to which it has attained.
To properly provide for such a vast
number and variety of plants as have
been exhibited in the department of
floriculture it has necessitated the
erection of numerous and extensive
greenhouses. Immediately on the west
of Horticultural hall stand these build
ings, forming in themselves a minia
ture city of glass-covered houses. In
these at the present time are to be found
treasured for transportation to fields
afresh countless bulbs and plants
which have served to beautify the won
derful city of white. Here at all times
we may find strolling to and fro arm in
arm and hand in hand couples whose
sentimental air suggests the romantic
story of love's young dream. Love and
flowers always go together.
There are other pleasant places where
sighing swains delight to roam with
the dear creatures in whom all their
hopes of future happiness lie. Away

.murmured soft and low wlithi the'
gates of that aungic city by the lake,
and many are the fates that bawe-been
sealed beside the still waters of the
limpid lagoon.
An attractive spot for the searcher
after historic lore is the Washington
house, in. the northeast portion of the
state building section." Tucked away
in the funny little rooms are the old
household treasures of the first presi
dent of this glorious republic-pianos,
paintings and brie-a-brae in the last
stages of decrepitude which in their
day were considered the finest in the
land; chairs, tables, etc., which are
held as too sacred to be handled by
careless hands. The house, the grounds
and all are reproduced as nearly like
the original homestead as human skill
could make them.
Situated on the ndrth lagoon close by
is another historic feature. It is the
Walton lodge, a quaint little cottage
erected to commemorate the great
deeds of the immortal Isaak, the patron
saint of fishermen.
Few visitors at the fair in passing
the quaint little cottage seem to recog
nize the import of its mission or the his
toric interest connected with its name.
When the members of this Chicago
fishing club determined to have an ex
hibit which should illustrate and en
hance the usefulness of their art they
wisely chose for their building a model
of the fishing cottage which Isaak Wal
ton and his adopted son, Charles Cot
ton, erected on the banks of the River
Dove in 1674, and which, after all this
lapse of time, still stands as an inter
esting reminder of the great apostle of
piscatorial pleasures.
Here within the last few days the
disciples of the great fisherman have
held contests of skill in the art of cast
ing the fly. and beautiful and valuable
prizes have been awarded to the victo
rious contesta:ts. It is exceedingly
doubtful if the father of fishermen ever
beheld in his dlay such feats of skill
with the rod and line as were performed
on these occasio,;s.
SEEKING HIS KIND.
Uncle asints from Missouarl Visits the
Great White City.
He was certainly the blackest man on
the grounds. There were no interme
diate shades about him, and instead of
light holiday attire the old man was
habited in a best suit of black, which
looked as if it might have been an heir
loom for several generations. His shirt
front and collar and the whites of his
eyes matched in fairness, but for the
rest there was no distraction of hue.
Even his lips were of so dark a pur
plish shade as to maintain no outline of
color. He was a study in black and
white, and his weazened old face was
twisted into hard knots of interest as
he squinted at the sights in the sun
shine. All his upper teeth were gone
and he limped painfully as if he car
ried a constant rheumatic "misery" in
his hip. In fact, in negro parlance, he
was "ogly tell he's pretty" and more
than one pair of eyes turned after him
with an interested glance. lie
tramped on, slowly and haltingly, as
one who has no objective point. In
his right hand dangled a parcel of ec
centric shape wrapped in a newspaper
'and tied carefully criss-cross with col
ored twine. It looked lumpy as a hoe
cake and was evidently a luncheon.
But, though the lace ran as rich a blue
as ever came out of Nature's dye-pot,
and though the sun shone tempered by
cool breezes, the old man looked lonely
and disappointed. lie had come to
seek his kind, and his kind were not
there.
"I clone thot tor meet all de culled la
dlies an gemmen frum all ober de

The white people who were enjoying
his conversation assured him that he
would get a chance to sing that after
noon if he went to Festival hall. ]Ie

S. Most housekeepers are aware of the
it painful--efeets produced when these
ir chemicals are applied to the external
.e ifesh. How much more acute must be
a their action upon the delicate internal
y membranes! Yet unscrupulous manu
Is facturers do not hesitate to use them,
e because they make a very low-co:.t
11 powder, nor to urge the use of their
powders so made, by all kinds of allur
y ing advertisements and false repre
r sentations. All the low-priced or so
e called cheap baking powders, and all
.t powders sold with a gift or prize, be
a long to this class.
Baking powders made from chemical
t ly pure cream of tartar and bi-carbon
ate of soda are among the most useful
of modern culinary devices. They not
only make the preparation of finer and
a more delicious cookery possible, but
they have added to the digestibility
and wholesomeness of our food. But
v baking powders must be composed of
I such pure and wholesome ingredients
or they must be tabooed entirely.
Dr. Edson, Commissioner of Health
r of New York, in an article in the "Doc
a tor of Hygiene," indicates that the ad
vantages of a good baking powder and
f the exemption from the dangers of
bad ones in which the harsh and caus
a tic chemicals are used, are to be se
e cured by the use of Royal Baking
, Powder exclusively, and he recom
a mends this to all consumers. "The
R- oyal," he says, ''contains nothing but
r cream of tartar and soda refined to a
r chemical purity, wjich when combined
1 under the inflaence of heat and mois
I ture produce pure carbonic, or leaven
ing, gas. The two materials used,
cream of tartar and soda, are perfectly
harmless even when eaten, but in this
, preparation they are combined in ex
act compensating weights, so that
when chemical action begins between
them in the dough they practically dis
t appear, the substance of both having
been taken to form carbonic acid gas."
Hence it is. he says, that the Royal
Baking Powder is the most perfect of
all conceivable agents for leavening
purposes.
It seems almost incredible that any
manufacturer or dealer should urge
the sale of baking powders containing
injurious chemicals in place of those
of a well-known, pure, and wholesome
character simply for the sake of a few
cents a pound greater profit; but since
they do, a few words of warning seem
to be necessary.

The sun shilues brightly and thc sky
i~ a eloudless blue asa we leaave=the
SHitchin.tation and begin our walk to
a the lavender fields, for which thi.
r countrygtown is faionaus. Long before
d we reach them, writes a tourist, we
scent the exquisite perfume of the,
: fsowers, heavy upon the -still -hot air.
And what a picture when at last we
reach the fel4, and, tuirning off the
J sandy road, come suddenly upon them
. a sight once seen, never forgotten.
Under the bright sunlight they lie,
field after field, one blazing mass of
l lavender, kissed into deepest violet;
now gray, as the sun hides for a mo
ment behind the cloud. The scent, de
licious from afar, is almost overpower
ing, and. for once in our lives, we think
it almost disagreeable. While we stanid
r looking the color deepens, and, soft
- ened by the sky and sun, the trees look
_ their brightest green in contrast to the
- mass of purple, the sandy road stretch
ing away in' the distance is perfect in
its harmony with the trees and fields.
The men are busy cutting, packing.
and carting, and soon we watch them,
and learn the why and wherefore of
their work.
Lavendar stalks are, as we all know,
i very stiff, and hard to break; to cut
them, therefore, the men have small
sickles: in the right hand these are
held, while with the left the stalks are
bent for the cutting,-and with a strong
stroke of the sickle severed from the
plant, and thrown upon the .ground.
M1eanwhile, other men gather the cut
lavender into huge bundles, and put it
in sacks, 'which are carted away to the
[ distilleries and different places, from
which it issues as lavendar water, lar
endar soap, and many other delicacies.
It is also sent to our towns and sold
there in the streets at three pence and
six pence for quite small bunches. At
Ilitchin as much as one can carry may
be bought for half a crown.
WVe hear so much of old lavender
bushes in country gardens, prized for
their antiquity by the owners, that I
learnt with surprise that, for market
purposes, plants are considered useless
after the third year. The first year
sees them small, and bearing little, if
any, flower; the second they are 'in
their prime, and should be a mass of
blossom; and the third year they begin
to go off, and cuttings from them are
taken for replanting, and the o1W
plants taken up as useless.
Lavender shoul, be thoroughly
dried before it is put into bags, such as
our great grandmothers loved to stow
among the linen. And if the scent is
to be preserved for any length of time
it should, after drying, be put in a
box and left until the flowers shake off
crisp and dry, leaving the stalks
separate. Then if put in bags or
made into the many delicate little
fancy articles, it will keep its sweetness
for -many a long day. Fans, sacks and
diminutive torpedoes are among the
prettiest ways of making-up lavender;
for the former either white or laven
der-colored -muslin, or, better still,
chiffon is used for the fan, and the
sticks with the same-colored ribbon
threaded among them for the fan
handle; for this, lavender on the stalks,
not separate, is better, the heads form
ing the fan inside the chiffon. Sacks
are more simple, being merely a bag
tied at the neck with a ribbon. For
what, for lack of a better name, I call
torpedoes, the flower heads are placed
inside a case made of stalks with ribbon
threaded in and out of them, and the
perfume passes through it. Lavender,
whether in bags or fancy articles, re
quires to be shaken pretty frequently
or the scent will probably be faint; a
good shake brings it back sweetasever.
Lavender stalks, when properly dried,
are most agreeable. I always keep
mine to burn to scent the rooms in
winter time, when there are no flowers.
They burn slowly, and if laid upon a
metal tray will smoulder on for a long
timne: a few stalks make quite a suffi
cient scent for an ordinary room. In
sick-rooms they are a boon, for the
smell is so much cleanter and more
natural than the pastilles and other
things which only offend the patient's
nose, and only clear the atmosphere
for a comparatively short time.-Lone
