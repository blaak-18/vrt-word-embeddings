The Wihiantson Movement.
Recent developmlents from the Rad
ical camp show to us no new plans,
is somen would think, but simply a
iepelition of the old 1872 campaign,
in older to secure a new lease of pow
er to the carpet-bag and scalawag
elemenlt.
Some of our people look upon the
nominiation of Gen. Williamson, ex
Colonel, Confederate army, to the
posjliion of Governor, upon the radi
cal ticket next year, as a new depart
nre on their part. Such, howerver, is
not tihe case, as at little reflection will
-how.
Of Col. Williamson's standing and
qualifications persoanally, no one can
judge, the flnet of his joining the
radical party in Louisiana at this
time, is prima, facia evidence of his
being "one of themn" in heart and
soul, and what they are, the world
knows, and we can but say that the
person going in with them now, Ino
matter what he nlaly express as his
intentions, or give as his reasons there
for, assunmes their past acts to be law
ful, just, awl Ihe takes or mueat take
his share of the responsibility, for
those unconstitutional acts, such as
l)urell's order, the consequent use of
troops and tile displacing of the le
gal (McEnery) goverment, following
he mtust admit the acts of the return
ing board to be just, and the conduct
in January, of the military in over
turning a State governmllent, to be
lawful; a responsilbilitj that neither
of the Congressional Committees dar
ed assume, as even the adjustment
tacitly adumits.
Personal preferment may actulate
(and does no doubt) many men, to do
thiings their own jInlgmlent must re
bel against. This talk of going into
the radical camp for the purpose of
assisting the white people has been
the excuse used by all those wilho harve
shifted their positions; have laid
down their principles, since recon
struction first began-but we have
yet to name one tihat acted in even
one instance, to the end that the
whites would be benefitted. On the
contrary, they have in nearly every
instance showed that zeal to their new
masters that has ever marked recent
converts to any cause. They have
been the most vindictive, the most
partizan of all that noble army (1)
of thieves who have enrichled them
selves at the expense of the people.
It is but history, the history of all
that same class that. hare existed
since the foundation of human gov
ernment, being repeated.
Kellogg, in 182;, was to have done
for Lolisiana just what Williamson
promises, or Iris clan, for hlim to do.
Chamtberlain was to llhave done for
South Carolina, what Moses did not
do, and we know too well Ihow they
have both fulfilled those promises.
Accepting as a fact, that tlhey were
all willing to reform, they are power
less to do so, from thie feact that they
ire without assistance. Kellogg hilas
ap legislators, Warlumouth's tlhieves;
Williamson will have the same thalt
Kellogg now lnas; in fact, tile plau1 is
simply to paint up thile old hulk, and
disguise it with a new figure-head.
Williamson, and go on as ever. That
is the plot and no one can deny it.
We take, for instance, suech materi
al as is presented to work up Mr.
lilfiamson's ideas of reform, if lihe
has any, in our respective communi
ties throughout the State, and we at
once see how utterly vain is thie hope
of relief from them. Take Natebito
ches, its parish and the district to
which it is attachled, as an example.
Blunt amid Twitchel as Senators, and
Pierson and Ruaby as Representatives,
put an end to all argument in favor
of hope, from Williamson's antieipa
ted lrailical State government. The
whites lhave shown in two elections,
1872 and 1874, that they are perfect
ly able to carry the State; of their
ability, for government history teach
es us, nod the man who would say
that negroes and tlhieves can better
govern society than honest, virtuous
and intelligent white men, insults
civilization, and libels history.
Very many of the radical papers
thlroughout tihe State, we refer to
those of ability anld tiat are repre
sentative, sauch as the LafoocheRlepub
lieas, thle Homer lliad, tile State Rey
ister, &e., are insisting upon honest
and capable men for office; the salr.e
ground we take, only tlhey argue an
impossibility, for they desire to:fill
up these positions from radical ranks,
and in this State all whlite radicals
and sympathisers, are office llholders
or their relations. No uneasiness is
manifested in (Conservative circles by
the WVilliamano bug-bear, ou the cono
trary, as tile representative of scala
wags and carpet-baggers, of tlhieves
raind out.laws, ilis defeat is as suscep
tible of accomplishament as that of
any role that can be named.
If the radiceal patty expect respect,
it must 'not meet the demand hlif
way, and the mention of Coi, Wii
lamaon's narnd in connection with
the ofice of GoverIdnor, uponm the radi
as tickeit, is an admission of'ini moral
weakness, but tl!ey must come up to
the entire requirements of the situa

The Fire.
On Mdondo y last the bright sun
shining beautifully bright, and every
one out to enjoy the finest weather
that our tine clinmate can produce,
snddenly amid the calm and quiet
mass there comes, startling the senses
with untold horror, the cry of fire !
fire ! ! Then follows in quick suc
cession the solemn peahl of the Cathe
dral bell, and soon hundreds collected
at Mr. G. V. Kearney's. on Touline
street, the location of the fire.
It was in an out building not used
by the family the fire originated, and
strange to say, its origin is quite mys
terious, for it was about half-past
twelve o'clock when it was discovered
antd the alarm given.
The building was used as a store
roomn by Mrs. J. Jules Bossiler where
she had almost all of her personal
property which was totallydlestroyed,
and it is a sad, sail loss to her.
Mr. Kearney smifelred nothing be
yond the general uneasiness of his
family and the breaking up of his
furniture.
The main building was saved` by
the noble efforts of those present and
the favorable direction of the wind.
Don't forget that John 'Rusca has
the best, cheapest and finest toys
in town.

The Speaker of the House.
M. C. Kerr, the Democratic Speaker
of the lHouse of Representatives of
the fort.:-fourth Congress was elected
fronm the third district of Indiana,
succeeding the Hon. Win. S Holman,
and is generally recognised as one of
tihe purest, ablest and best men, of
the party. Conning into the office free
from any charge of any kind, it
speaks volumes for tihe final success
of the Democratic party. At the
very begining ; at the very £rst step
of their successful nMarch, they'show
what they mean to do by thle election
of such a man as the Hou. M. C.
Kerr. His record is clear, and lie
goes into the Speaker's stand with
outany' charge of wrong-doing tack
ed to his garments. Ile has always
been recognized as a fair minded and
honorable gentleman and a stainch
and trie Democrat.
The interests, both of party and
country, will not suifemr in his hands,
nor need the opposition fear any par
tisan partiality shown them, for he is
tree trom anytlnog like party prej
udice that 'could be set up in place of
whdlesome laws for the general good
of the country. Hle will lend a char
acter and dignity to the sessions of
the House, that will recall the days
of the long and hburied past,whci the
intellectual giantsof America met to
contend for "thle greatest good to the
greatest nnmbei." None of those
disgraceful scenes that have occurred
in the halls of thie Nation's capital
will then .happen again under his
leadership; but legislation will go
quietly on not unjustly hampered for
partisan purposes. This we look
upon as a good omen for the demo
cratic party and their final triumph
over all enemnies.

Unwntten Laws.
There are certaijn inherent rights
possessed by tile people of any couno
try, and although many of them may
not l1e expressed in statutory form,
yet they are as much rightsaaif they
were, and amuong these analienable
privileges dear to the American cit
izen i'l his undisputed prerigative to
petition the powers t!hat be to iedress
auny wrong, real or imaginary, or to
farther any public necessity or enter
prise.
It is,' abolute!y imperati.e that
the voters of this Pariah take.a vote
on the railroad tar, and the Police
Jnury :have been petitioned to snbmit
the ordinance to the people for their
approval or rejection, as the case nmay
be, and yet they, thie Police Jnry, turn
a deaf ear to tie pIeople and witli an
preme indifference adjourn without
action in the premises! If but one
·citizen had made this appeal, hi hiad
a right to be heard, and it is not the
province of the Police Jury to debar
any one from this great privilege nor
is it for them to say, we shall ?dt vote
for or agilthmt tle tax.

Our Foreign Cit,:ins.
Grant's party, for we think it use.
less longer to term the opposition
replhlier:tns,'lave foreshadowed their
gamne for next year's campaign. They
have marked out the plan of hattle,
and invited the ceotestntt American
voters to meet them in the field.
Tlhey will accept the. gnage. Satis
flied that it is certain defeat to enter
the contest of l376 with the past
record of the radical puarty, and all
must admlt this to be so, there is but
one course left to keep life in the
party.
As individuals, the leaders are cor
rnpt, and have been condemned by
their constitnents; love of country
and the advancing of it's prosperity
dioes not actuate themn; party and
its supremacy at all hazards, is to be
the rallying cry of these knavish he
roes, and the slums of America are
to be invited to a feast of prejudice
and a flow of p:ission. The three
classes marked out for distraction,
and upon whose devoted head will
decend all these pent up vials of
wrath, are our foreign citizens, two
of which are called by name, the
otheres go in globo under the cogno
men of Catholic.
The Jews, Dutch and Papists, are
the classic names given by Grant's
organ to the marked American citisen ;
marked as to be deprived of all, save
the enjoyment of life; marked as the
victims of persecution at the hand of
the followers of Logan, Hutler, Chand
lar, and other exponents of Puritan
doctrines.
They are our fellow-citizens, have
as much right to enjoy with all its
blessings, thie free air of America,
and as such, we consider it our duty
to protect, defend and stand by them.
We are not surprised that Grant
shuld evince such hatred to the
J,~wislh race, lie has shown.it on more
thaun one occasion, at first, e:dhibiting
hut his own power as a General offi
cer, and manifesting ridiculous spleen,
it scens at little strange, however,
that he should carry with him to the
White House, as the chief ruler of a
-people, the smell of the camp. Such,
inevertheless, is the cake, and the
edict against our Israelite brethren,
or Jews, as lie hissingly terms them,
has gone forth.
Pharaoh No. 2 (on a small scale)
has had his heart hardened, and we
are called upon to witness, in the 19th
century and in free America, the out
rageous persecution of the chosen
children of God ; for they have been
chosen, claim to be chosen, and will
bie chosen in the end, say what we
will. This fiendish order has gone
forth from th~e President; the Presi
dent of the United States. Be it re
.me5ll:red, that the Isralite popula.
tion in this country, as in all others
where not persecuted, are wealthy, as
a mass, prosperous, and add greatly
to the material welfare of thle Union.
As a class, they are merchants, bank
ers and capitalists, they are good law
abiding tax paying citizens, and yet
they must be persecuted, and why,
forsooth t Simply to gr:atify hate, to
sustain power, and prop up thie wan
ing, dying, radical party; a party
born and nurtured in hate, sustained
even in the zenith of its glory, by ap
peals to passion and prejudice.
Next in order conies thle German;
Dutch, as Forney, Grant's month
piece, calls them. The quiet, tlhriftyi,
hard-working German. He is to be
reviled at, driven out, hIe is not wor
thy to exercise the privilege, the ne
gro may enjoy as a righlt. It is even
thus, that reason has fled to brutish
beasts. That population has lent as
much, if not more aid to the prosperi
ty of America, than all others. Aliens
from persecution at home, they fled
to the shores of America, the heralded
boasted home of freedom, to find,
alas, too late, that it was but as the
mirage, that invited them to worse
degredation than that from whlich
tlhey fled. The Germans are the ag
ricultoralist of the country, as a class,
and because they drink beer and are
not born in America, they are not fit
civil companions for the negro ead
thie Puritan.
Then the poor' Roman Catholice-
thle "subjects of the Pope of Rome."
Bah I This subject is sickening. What
Roman Catholic in the United States
Is a "s'nUject of the Pop of Ro~ie ?P
We defy an answer. There is not
one! What Catholic wants sectarian
sclools9 Not one We are not
speaking of zealous biggots, for
whichI tlhe Catholices, as a classe, are no
more responsible thtan society is for
the murderer. But because Jews,
Catholics, Epiecdpalesni and other
denominations are oppose4 to reli
gious school instructions, they are in
favor of sectarian schnoole. Under
the hlead of Catholic, cormes tlhe'6tlhe
foreign popukitions, the Irigh, Pninchl
and Spanish. It is but the blaze of
tile dark ages rekindled by tihe incen
diary hands of Grant and his radical
'i'ilowers, in tlute b~rid glare pf the
19th eeutury. The feast of theCen
tennial of American liberty is to be
celebrated by the depriving df nil
lions of citizens of ,their rightis. is
not this enough to. resurrect tile dead
fathers of the Republic. Was it for
this thMtliey sufibred,' ad 'died ? Is
this the erse they 'thought they had
b4atlied as a blea~jing ! ,..
Thnem is yet one hope. ,Pandomra
box still contains 9he antidote to all
these mniseries. )ihe gran, glorious
Democratic party, sfands at ihand to
delend the weak as it ever has. Its
portals are open; the oppressed
froti ,all nations can enter without
money and without price.
ThVe People's House.
All eyes in Louisiana are turned
pith longi'g and expectant looks to
the incotnini House of RIrepresetnta
tives of this State. For the first
time in eight long and d'reary years;
years marked w'ith desolation to our
people, a body assembles represent
ing, or supposed "o represent, the in
terest of the tar payer and white
citizen.
We have, during this decade, pass
ed through such as we care not to
mention ; the' thought is suflicient to
make the best of us shudder, and yet
the end is not reached.
Upon the calm, wise action of our
Representatives, depend much of our
future success. We know full well
how they are situated, powerless in
fact, to do anything, save by sheer
force, which happily is at their conm
iland. The purse of the State is in
their keeping, which renders in itself,
tlmhir position one of great impor
tance. They have a responsibility
resting upon them, from this fact
alone, that will call into action the
liveliest exhibition of patriotism, and
the ken of Louisiana will be upon
each individual.
In this contest between self-inter
est and public patriotism, no man can
escape a rigid scrutiny of his con.
lauct, and the demand of the public
must be rigidly adhered to.
In an extraordinary contest, as that
of 1874, much fear was indulged in
that the demagogue would usurp the
place of the patriot statesman, and
the Wheelet adjustment agitation
lhad well nigh led people to believe
they had been in the majority. To
set at rest public fears on this score,
the action of virtue on the pati of
the house must be palpably appa
rent. No half way, weak, puling at
tempt must be made, but a stern,
vigorous move entered into at once
for the demanded reforms. .For the
past years we have cried down carpet
bag and radical negro governments;
we have shown their venom, their
blunders and their spoilations, both,
upon the liberty and rights of the
citizen and the public purse. There
fore we must show that' we are will
ing and able to put in practice those
measures for public good, that the
actions of the radicals have shown
them to be incapable of. This. also
lenders the position of the people's
legislator, one of marked iumportance,
for uqnot only are the expectant hopes
of friends centered upon them, but
also the enemy are depending for
future success on the hope of their
sluning.
We doubt not, but that the house
is composedl of men of ability and
patriotism, and in looking over the
tield in search of even the shadow
of a fatal error, upon which we might
be wrecked, we find none, save that of
discord; upon union alone depends
success. That shadow we fear, and
that fear pervades the mind of the
entire people.
It is one thing to talk statesman
ship and another to act thie statesman,
and we must now, in Louisiana, have
a practical demonstration of it.
Our statute books are full of mate
rial upon which to work. Bad laws
are to be repealed and good ones en
acted, to replace them, unlesa this is
done, then we have no hope of funtnre
success, for more reasons than one.
Our people look upon their legisla
tors with calmness and hope, not un
mingled with fear, however, and wee
betide them, shoald they be faithless
to thie trust reposed in them. If be
trayed, tile State, it's people and all
is lost, and upon those who couid have
averted such a calamity and did not,
will rest the curse of generations yet
unborn.

A Third Term.
Not many months since it was
thought by many that this cry had
been put down by Grant's Peninsyl
rania letter. Such, however. is not
the case. The monster again looms
up on the political horizon and seems
to overshadow everything at this mo
ment.
The Cincinnatti Comrnercial tells us
that, "where once one man talked
third term, now ten do, so." Some
are still doubting that Giant will al
low himself used for such a purpose,
these, we say, are few, for but few
think of Grant other than an ambi
tious soldier, ready to accept or do
anything to "himself."
The late elections have developed
the fact that the well meaning repub
licans of the North, as well as that
class of virtuous nonentities, the in
dependent voter, have been shame
fully tricked into the support of the
reform (1) republican party, and his
partisans now claim the results to be
an endorsement of him. The Des
Moines speech was the great gun ;
that speech that Grant "took the
trouble" to go all the way to Iowa to
make and in which he "took the trou
ble" to abuse Catholics, Jews and the
Duteh. The American people look
upon this gathering storm with ap
prehension and-they are fearful that
great trouble will be the consequence.
The Republic has traditions t!K.om
mend themselves to theAmerican
citisen that call forth an *libibition
of patriotism on his part to defend
and cherish, that are as sacred to him
as the written constitution. One of
these unwritten laws, bh, neverthe
less as inviolate, is, tkat no person
shall occupy the Presidential chair
more than two term* in succession,
in fact more than two terms in all.
Grant proposes to rushlesaly disturb
this tradition and well may the vir
tuous citizen be alarmed thereat, for
the person who has no veneration for
our traditions would have hut little
respect for the constitution if it stood
in the way of his desires. Grantism
does not mean Grant per se; he is but
the figure-head of a most powerful
combination; a combination that will
run the government, and has ran it
for personal and corrupt ends. Grant,
however, is the most powerful,
man they can name,' for the
reasons, that he has his war record,
of a successtul general at least; he is
in office and controls the patronage
of the governmoent ; has a vast army
ofofficials to obey is beck and call;
ihe has besides that, the negro radical
vote South and its leaders, he is nn
scrupulous in his action and has
evinced but little regard for that in
stroment called the constitution. He
is nevertheless a man of more parts
th:an he is given credit for, but those
parts are of the above mentioned
class. As we have just said a power
ful combination backs him and a pow
erful handling it will take to put hIim
out. Gen. Blair said that death alone
would or could induce Grant to vacate
the White House. These words
sorunded at one time rather strange,
now, people propound the question,
was not Blair right
We will have Grant to beat, that
fact is certain; his nomination is surem,
he is the only man that can come
near saving the radical party from
defeat, no one else possesses a ghost
of a chance to do so. The American
people can rest assured of one feact,
Grant will be nominated by the Re
pubtlean party next year. He will
accept and will require strong work
to defeat himn. It is no child's play,
rest assured, and we should at once
prepare for action.
The Mansfield Reporter don't kgow
Senator West, but thinks if le is as
good a man as his brother,. he is tip
top. Friend Potts can learn what
kind of a man West is, by reading
up his coourie as Seasitor from this
State. Take the Durell midnight or
der business; his conduct to the Lon
isiana whites sliM 18,2, io eneral.
His votes and speeches on the seizure
of the State House by troops last
year, his stand on the force bill. &ce.
His action is anything but that whtich
would commend itself to the ceaosid
eration of a Louisinian.i he action
of the citizens of Shreveport, is an
affair that people may differ about, at
least, we have heard leading gentle
men here, materially difrer Mas to the
propriety of these halla-baloos over
West. He can certainly do, them no
good in the way of the proposed
railted aid from the government.
The question will be voted down in
the Democratie House, as it should
be. This aid to private corporations
has been the entering wedge to all
the frauds that we are now groaning
ounder. It is contrary to the spirit of
Democracy; contrary to the constitn
tion, and no Democrat who vainues tihe
name and traditions of his party will
vote one dollar of the people's mon
ey in any way, slhape or form, to rail
roads, or any other ptivate corpora
tion.

And mark grief's melancholy shade
Flung o'er Hope's fairest idol.
