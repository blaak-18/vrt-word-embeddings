Our Washington Letter.
Washington,D. C. April 7, 1877.
When a spendthrift stands, thread
bare, hiingry and penniless in the
streets and looks back on a great for
tune thrown away, he curioiusly but
invariably attributes its loss to the
rare occasions, when just or chant
able impulses have appeared to cost
him considlerable sums, anid cannot
understand that not these but a life
of p'lesistent fully will fully account
for his changed condition. Occasion
al payments of a thousand pounds
conio before him and obscure the dis
silation which has robbed hlin of
miillions. In soething like this
spirit it is that the old Republican
leaders, like Phillips aniid Garrison,
ancoiuint for the strait in which they
flind their party. Tlie South receives
her rights, the country is at peace,
aind these leaders feel that their pow
er is slipping from their grasp. Yet
the fail to take a manly view of the
causes which produced such results,
anlid in letters and speeches they be.
wail every act of justice the party
has ever done or is doing, and curse
every kindly impulse that ever exist
ed within it. They will not see that
the party was founided oand conductedl
oil principles which could not long
survive under a free government-on I
force, and hate and plunder. They
will not relnember that only those
strong men have left its organiza- i
tion who have felt that charity and
kindness and justice must have a
place in life. Phillips and Garrison
will never be wiser, but they may be
come so repulsive that others will
take waring from them.
There seems to have been a scram- [
ile among the South Carolina carpet
baggers to see which should be first e
in the good graces of Governor Hamp- ,
ton. Patterson and Bowen certainly
made their peace early, and if they
do not hold out it will be because of i
that freshening "breeze that sweeps a
from the North" which agitates men b
in even higher positions. Now comes V
Chamberlain and publishes all the 0
good and conservative acts and ap
pointments of his term, as Governor, n
ag though lie will probably never re- ti
turn to South Carolina as to a home,
he evidently does not wish all the in
telligent citizens of the State to look "
upon him forever as )ne without re d
deeming qualities. In the rejoicing a
that will evitably follow her libera- C
tion South Carolina can afford to be at
forgiving to those who have plunder- I
ed and abused her. fr
There is no doubt but Stanley Mat Il
or. thews Coiuld pro\C to his oiil saitis
faction, that the Presidential election,
so fill' as Louisiana was concerned,
was held itn tlie Gulf of Melexico-a
' hundred niles from her coast, just ls

rin, ed to ltaves electors in the States did
not elect ' ekard. The ptettchst is
rate, that the l:cts of the Returninig loard
were ti nalas to the electors, but as
to the GOcrnor the Legislative can
review the conc'lusions of the Board.
This is not ouly not founded on
t.pll, the law of the State, but presents
poýibhilities in thet carryinl out
that make 'Preideiit llayes' ocpiin
well, cy of his presellt flace dishonorable
to himin. If the Legislatutre shall seat
Nhidlls, on the groiund that votes
were inltpoperly thrown out by the
Hleturninthg lHard, and l'ackard shouhld

tain Nicholls by force, his own title

' The P'resident said yesterlay that

ificatio:n of the public service as soon
as Southern aflairs welreti settled.
The latest reports from New Or

mined to naintain himself as Gover

It is evident to the most indiffetrent
