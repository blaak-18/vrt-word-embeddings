Railroad Benefits.
We propose to have a long railroad
talk with our people; to deal in fig
ures, and show to thenm a few of the
many benefits and great blessings
which will accrue to them upon the
completion of this New Orleans and
Pacific RaiTroad.
Some weeks since we spoke of the
onerous charges made by the Cornm
mission houses in New Orleans, in
the way, of Commissions for selling
cotton, purchasing merchandise, &c.,
also the high rates of insurance and
the want of a good paying market for
such other produce, which we ship to
them, than the staples, sugar, rice
and cotton.
It is adOmitted that the charges as
Comnmissions in New Orleans, at pres
ent, are more than in any other Comn
mercial city of like importance.
Upon the completion of this pro.
posed railroad through to Marshall,
Texis, we at once enter into the line
of competitive markets, and competi
tire transportation. With New Or
leans on one side of us, there will be
upon the other, the great western and
eastern markets, fromt which to choose
where we can sell for higher and buy
at cheaper rates. A rivalry for the
trade of the great State of Texas and
the lRed River valley will immedi
ately spring up, and New Orleans to
save herself, must in consequence re
duce her charges and Commissions to
such rates as it will give her, with
what natural advantages now poe
sessed, the great advantage in stri
king out to regain her lost trade. Let
us now deal in a few muathemattey
facts bearing upon the case at issue,
whether taking stock in the railroad
to the extent recommended by our
Executive Committee, would ho a
measure of practical wisdom or not.
In the first place, it has been prov
en by actual demonstration that
while, the great monopoly roads of
the west, and when we 'ay mono
poly, we mean those in which the
citizens along their lines held no con
trolhng or advisory interest in the
shape of shares for ,bonds issued
these roads at the time of construc
tion, hence the great railroad war,
on account of high freights charged,
which gave rise in the first instance
to the now great Grange Association.
In this, freights had been run tup to
such high rates that the farmer of
the west had no profit from his grain
and other produce shipped east.
In Georgia this was not the case, (and
also in other States) for there the
roads were constructed upon the co
operative plan, the same as proposed
for this road; that is, the cities and
counties along the line rendered aid
in the shape of bonds and money, for
which they received stock shares from
eilailroad Company, tthus enabling
ttemi tIR el Vmey-upu uu salrer,
in the election of Directors, to man
age and control the tariff offreight.
to an even balance-so that the road
paid, and at the same time the fiar
mer could ship Iis produce at reason
able rates,
In this way, we on this line will
protect ourselves from an occurrance.
of the complaints made by the west
ern farmer alluded to. This we give
as one substancial reason tohy we
should suboribe the amount named,
$150,000.
Suppose we look further into what
we first mentioned with regard to the
New (leans charges. Tathug in this
instance. First-the 2* per cent now
being charged for the sale of our cot
ton in New Qrleans. Our crop for
this parish is 20,000 bales, which have
averaged us the past season *60 per
bale; the commissions upon each
would be $1.50 or $30,000 upon the
entire criop. Do we not see that at
the legitimate 1j per cent, this would
save the people who plant and pay
fthe farxe $15t000 per year alone.
Three thousand dollars more than the
interest we are to pay upon the bonds
of our parish; and to put it more
plainly, this railroad puts into your
pockets $15,000 for this item, and
asks for it $12,000, when you now en
joy the sweet blessing, if it can be
called such, of paying out the entire
$15,000. Look at item number two,
here we see theaeeming small item
of drayage, mending, &e., charged
upon your cotton sales each year, at
s75 etse uer bale, or Ia the naggregat.
nponthe entip cerop, $15,000 in round
numabers. 1ow, it is a well known
fact that these Commission Merchants
never pay a cent for this, as the
Compress men do it all for nothing,
as they get to compress the eotton
after rale by the Commission Met
lihat, and ino that-is tlhe wareliouse:
aman' proit. This mast coie offto:
a great extent, we will say I, 6rit
will ave to you $10,000; just enough
to pay the yearly tax for the princi
c! of th~e bonds and *2,500 over.
Thoee two savings make youa richer
by jost $5;500, simply stved by the
railroad, which brings the competa
tive markets, oand your tar is already
paid for principle .and interest upon
jyro bonds eaoh year. Tllhik of tiis

Duty of Our Land Owners.
We see that much enquiry is being
made by parties from the hills of this
and other parishes, with relation to
the purchase of river lands, and as
the VTaibecator has advocated that all
should some into the valley whoxipect
to farm and receive at the same time
the more remuneration for their labor;
we think it our duty also to express
our views to our land owners upon
the duties required of them in our
struggle to populate this parish with
sterling white emigýntse.
Large firming, as a rule has, by
actual trial, been found ouremnnera
live, and statistics show that the
arge mass of our cotton is grown by
small farmers; in ~tet this rale ap
plies as well to the North in the cnl
tivation of grains as to the South.
Many persmas own in this parish
lands, spon the river, of thousands of
act in single hodiesr not more than
one tenth of which is in cultivation,
nor has been since tile war. We say
this as the geneial rule whicir ap
plies to the entire 'lTari as well.
The nlajority of this river lanm, par
ticularly upon the fronts, has been
cleared and was at one time in enl
tivation, now fenceless am? house
less, and we hear some say that they
will ask this and that price per acre
as if this same land was in a high
state of improvement--this is not
right, and shorws a want of apprecia
tion of the situation. These lands
will require much labor and some
cost to put them in proper condition
for cultivation--they are cleared it is
true-but, we contend they are in the
samue condition as wild lands, and
should he sold as such. No one can
hold large properties that pay no rev
enue without loss to them-this is
the exact condition and has been for
a long time of our land owners, taxes
have eaten up thousands of acres and
will continue to do so until the sys
tem of selling cheap, all lands not re
quired is adopted.
We need never look for a class
of labor, such as some dream of, that
all their lands may be cultivated
with a something like peonage.
That day has passed, and evo must,
as a duty we owe ourselves and so'
ciety, sell lands cheap to encourage
immigrants, anid thereby, not only
build up the general prosperity of the
country, but the wealth of each in
dividual land owner.
Sell but half, cheap, and that half
being highly improved, renders the
remainder trebly valuable.
We hope that the gentlemen now
in our midst in search of homes in
our valley will be met properly, so
that they may obtain lands of us at
sueli prices as will be an inducement
for them and others to come among
us.
The question ot what carrency mwill
be used as the circulating medium,
and the policy of returning to specie
payments, hlas swallowed up all other
snbjects in the election canvass now
going on in the North. This is done
to the detriment of other and more
grave subjects, for , we are of the
opinion that the more the currency is
lawed about and tinkered at, the
worse condition will it be in. It will
naturally assume its own proper ba
sis without the help of our solons.
We had thought that our Democratic
friends North, would hold the Radi
cals responsible for tihe outrages com
mitted upon the lives of Southern
Sftates-the bayonet rule in Louisiana
-the plunder of Treasuries, and the
Carpet-bag dominion over the whole
South for the past ten years.
But this question has not been
spoken of much, no doubt to the joy
of the Republicans. Why should it
not be, seems strange to us.
We had for a long time thought
that the influence of good men, the
moral teachings of christianity had,
to a great extent, diatroyed much of
the barbarous instincts of man. But
the mnrders lately committed by the
Nicholsonsmake as rather doubtful.
For cold, calmn nassassination; the
imurder of Young, as related by these
two fiends caps the elimax, and we
wonder how men can put up-longer
with thenm.
The railroad question still seems to
engross a large portion of the public
`nind, and polities are forgotten for
the nonce.
The subseriptio!sa up to this time
foot up twenty thousand dollars,
This asum.representesonly that amount
subseribed by private parties.
We hope our parish .andeity will
be able to do something also.
We hear that the yellow fever pre

thus fiar, and tilt logical axium of
"what has been tine, can be done,"
is, we think, notiegotisticaly speak
ing, applicable to our situation. We
propose to give !", an airing soon.
Some years sinds the practicability
of building a Cattn Factory at this
point was much talked of, and we
believe that sevral gentlemen enter
ed into correquondence with the
Spragnes in rehtion to the subject,
and much hop was entertained of
its being made success.
We have splendid water power
near by, Sibley's Lake. which could
be made of greit use for manufactur
ing purposes, a we well know that
the cotton mills f Georgia have tend
ed wonderfully build up her great
wealth. In fati, very little heavy
cottons are sold in this market which
was not made up in Georgia. Could
not we instead of shipping our cot
ton in its raw state, mlanufacture
thenlu into varns, t""" . .'--, * iast
the prohit to our own home people.
Although we are strongly in favor
of all Ipublic improvements, such as
railroads, telegrphs, &c still we
think sonme attention dshould at once
be given to this factory question.
Many persons win have means would
no donat subecrite to the enterprise
more readily that to railroads. The
dividens paid b. Southern Manufaec
turing Companiss have been large,
and capital lias sought investments
in such stock eagerly. Some enter
prising citizen aSaould take the lead
in this and see What can really be
done. .

JOE MOLONArY ON THE RAMPAGO.
Our usually quiet town was thrown
into quite an excitement last evening.
It seems that Joe. Moloney, a mcolored
blacksmith, employed by Mr. Mayear,
was engagedi fring Anvils in hon.
or of the return pf Bishop Martin,
and took too much bensine, which
brought upon him a perfect freaosy.
He knocked down another negro,
struck the nurse d Wmin. Boulltwho
had a child in her arms, struck tihe
child also, nnd was finally captured
by Chief Greneanu, whnbo had arrived
at this moment on the ground. This
Molouey, when in liquor, has scarcely
failed to create a 4isturbaance, and we
think be shorld be severely dealt
with as his eounduet on this occasion
was simply outrageous .

Dear Sir-In the Republican of 11
Aug. 14th, I see the "Field," "Citi- C
zen," "Anticroi" and "Observer," in
combined force, firing at me, in an
swer to a communication to yours
of Aug. 7th, concerning the "Drug
gists and Merchants War." I see no i
danger to fear those balls as they a
come from such inferior guns and p
weak material that all their guns and r
ammunition have not force enough to 1
flatten any common sense man's o
brain.. "Observer," is good natured, 1i
and his gun does neither good nor
harm, he only fires, cuts and split C
snakes and Wolfs-on the Bluff with- I
out touching any point on the bottom, t
in other words, he don't touch the n
question. I
"Citizen" is pointing his gun at
random on a few straggling refugees ti
from other lands and countries, un v
fortunately for them, too well regula. I
ted to allow such outrages against d
the welfare, nay the lives of their u
fellow men ; and they, for the sake e
of profit, put into their pockets the g
ill-gotten prize of a few cents at the
expense of human life, and without a
having a diploma from a medical or a
pharmicentical society. Who are the n
refugees who sell medicine without t
having diplomas I Is it Carver & a
Taylor, Trichel & Airey, Holmes, r
McCook, Broadwell or Ben Wolfson ?
No! But he confines to the refugees d
of other lands and countries. That a
must be: Caspari & Dietrich, Theo. I
Schuman, Levy & Phillips, John Ge- I
not, 11. Linchtenstine, A. Perini, i
Kahn & Levy, Simon Winebarg,
Julius Lisso, and others. t
Now Mr. "Citizen," when you refer t
to the so-called straggling refugees e
from other countries, their laws, bah. i
its and customs, tell them the whole u
of your intelligence if you know it, f
and not only a part of it. Before af
,man becomes a druggist in that ref.
Igee country, hlie must have a fiull
classical education, and practice in
drugs, medicines and chemistry, for a I
number of years, and most go through 1
an examination in every branch ap- a
pertaining hereto. 6
Commissioners are appointed to ex
amine twice a year every drug-store;
r they must be kept clean ; drugs and
medicines must be fresh, and any of
then old, worm eaten, or the least
affected by evaporation or from other
causes must be thrown away ; four
years-old snake root, two years old
cammomile, worm eating rhubarb, or s
sour honey, if found on hand, in or
, about the, establishment, the drug
gist is flnedand his diploma canceled.
The commissioner establishes the
- price of every Jose for sale, he must
i keep on hand a full supply of every
article in the medical catalogue. He
cannot substitute molasses for honey,
vinegar and sugar for citric acid, or
aloes for rhubarb. The druggist is
r not a merchant and vice versa. His
I duty and his privilege are special,
gentlemanly conduct and strictly
temperate is a strict rule in the drug
t gist's profession. These are the laws
- and regulations in a well regulated
Scountry. The professor respects his
profession and the people respect
their professor.
I Now comes the third gun, Amicron,
I he is rather a refined gentleman, lihe

only men that can get legally drunk.
SThat law is evidently made for the
bi enet of the liquor law, and not for
the benefit of the drouggists. As for
the errors of naskillful merchants,
I there has been more poison sold in
, error by the so-called draggist, than
, by thie merchants.
"Citizen," "Amicron" and "Obser
0 .ver," have not touched or answered my
proposition; namely: Ball & Lyons,
Wheelock & Finly, Dr. Walker,
o James, Moffatlh and John Bull, are
all regular chlemists and druggists;
they prepare various medicines ad
6 opted for various diseases; they sell
[. them already bottled and labeled
by the 0doen; why could I not buy
II from them and sell thie same without
y having the quali8cation of a druggist,
chemist, or having a diploma f The
license question is a secondary consi
deration. The i50 license doet qnual
* ify you any more as a druggist than
*s lawyer's liease will qualify you to
Spractiee at the Bar without adiploma.
My opinion is a before, that the
C druggists license isto compound and
L. mix anything he can sell, either by
pieseription or otherwise, and the
merchants may bouy aything already
c ompounded sad mixed and unmixed
-ander their respective license.
n I have been informed by several
. leading merchant., that their stock of
d drugs on hand is an expense to them;
that they are compelled to keep same
on hand as their customers lost all
the' confldence in the former druggist,
, the way the empty drug-stores are
, kept.

brother, William B. Stille, who died
on the 10th inst., the following reso
lutions were' adopt l'::
Whereas, it bus pleased Almighty
God, the Supreme Architect of the
Universe, whose way\are inscrutable,
to visit with death and take from our
midst our worthy brother and friend,
William B. Stille, theretfre; belt
Resolved, That while we mourn
the loss of brother William B. Stille,
we mourn not as-those without hope;
lint recognize the fiact that he is not
dead, but has only been translated by
our Supreme Grand Master from this
earthly and imperfet Lodx , to that
grand and celestial Lodge above.
Resolved, T'hat ini tlelifr amdchar
acter of brother William Va Stille,
was always to be found the exemplary
mason, the upright andm honest man,
the worth, citizen, and the genial
and trune friend; anri while we bow
with humble submission totlib Divine
will, we cannot but abanuta that in his
death our order habs let' one of its
strongest supporters, one of its main
pillows ; our country ome of its truest
patriots, and society one of its most
useful members.
Resolved, That we deeply sympa.
thize with the bereaved btitther of
the deceased, with whom our depart
ed brother has been so long and so
intimately associated ; the two were
[as one. We know how hard it: was
for him to speak the last sad earthly

There is evidently some excitement
in New Orleans ober the yellow fever.
Pascagoula has it badly. The U. 8.
troops are leaving the city for Holly
Springs, Miss. We opine that Kel
logg ran of for the same reason, and
left, his little Antoine in charge.
Yellow fever has no uae for men of
Antoine's color, hence he is safe.
The New Orleans RepblCnio
must not be so pathetic. Our ad
vice to that "thieves own," is to
quietly enjoy its monopoly, for if
we mistake not, the time is abort
for it.
Tie mails are comsing to us more
regularly. The Texas roote still acom
plains of the manner in which the
schedule Is arranged. Part of the
route has two mails weekly, and the
other, three. This should be arrang
ej) some how.
The La., Telegraph Co., seems to
he a private corporation and is said
to be composed of sound men.
Capt. Hienn has withdrawn from
the trade again, head 8iaeott has it
all to himsel.
We learn that the mrains are doing
serious damage to crops in. many
portions at oour parikh.
