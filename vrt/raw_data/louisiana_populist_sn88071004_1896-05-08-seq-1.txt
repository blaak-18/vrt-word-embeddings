Bragg used to call Joseph Wheeler
his "Pony Colonel." Referring to the
battle of Shiloh, Col. Geo. G. Garner,
Bragg's adjutant general, said: ",When
Prenties and Wallace's division were
pressing upon and driving back Chal
mers' brigade, Bragg, Hardee and
Beauregard were on an elevation and
saw the advance of the federal line.
They thought it was a desperate at
tempt of the federal army to pierce
our center, and when they saw Chal
mers yielding to this large force, were
necessarily much alarmed; but when
they saw Wheeler meet and check the
advance, their anxiety was turned to
to joy, and Gen. Bragg was so pleased
that he raised up and down in his stir
rups, saying: 'It is my pony colonel,
it is my pony colonel."

free and simple to trust in the old

Washington, Special to the Times
Herald Many southe -a and western
democrats refuse to accept as accurate
the declaration made In the Times-lier
aid of Saturday that the ellver craze
had re-.ched the beginning of the end,
and that it will make nothing but d
little noise in the Chicago convention.
Southern senators assert that there is
only one salvation for the detr-ocratla
party, and that is to come out openly
for free coinage at 16 to 1. A number
of southern senators have sa'd to the
correspondent of the Tit.-s-H"rald that
in their section of the country the bil
ver craze Is running so strong nothing
can stop it. It is gaining ground every
day. Every state is being swept by the
silver sentiment. Says a southern sen
ator:
"If the democratic party adopts a gold
platform at Chicago there will be little
left of the party in my state. The ma
jority of democrats will go over to the
populists. To understand the situation
in the south you should know that
four-fifths of our democrats believe
nothing but the free coinage of silver
can restore prosperity. Nothing could
induce these democrats to become re
publicans. That would be abandonment
of all their cherished traditions and
prejudices. It is easy, however, to join
the populist party. That Is only a step.
No one has fought the populist party.
It is not an ancient enemy. Besides.
the men who are now in the populist
party may they are still democrats. 'We
are aust as much democrats as. we ever
were,' they say, 'and we have come to
this party only for the purpose of se
caring free coinage, which cannot be
done in the old party. When we have
accomplished that we shall go back to
our old allegiance.'" This is the pres
sure and this the argument that will
destroy the democratic party In the
south, temporarily at least, if it adopts
an antisilver platform. Our people will
go over to the populists and we shall
lose halft the southern states, not to the
I republicans, but to the third partyttes.
Joseph Rickey, of St. Louts, who may
be regarded as one of the shrewdest
of the silver leaders, says the demo
cratic national convention will declare
tfr free tolesage at 16 to 1 and nominate
a free silver candidate. He continues:
"This is as certain as fate, and the ad
ministration will ind that it has not
power enough to stop it. Since com
tag to Washtington, I have heard what
the administration men's programme
is. They think they can swing aildly
against silver all the states of New Eng
land 'aad the east, voting them as units.
In the south and west they propose to
ksnoc out the unit rule In order to per
mit the distrlets to vote as they please.
That will not work. We propose to
cheokmate that little game in Missouri
orm the start. We are not only going
to vote the state as a unit, but we are
gaing to seleet the district delegate at
the state conventlon. That is demo
aeuy. In the rpablican party the dis
trict is the unit, but with us it is the
state. The demeeratie national con
ventoes is as a ssblage of satire
states, just like the house of represen
tatives when it meets to elect a presi
dent of the United States. I can give
Peo a piece of news. The populists will
nominate for presidet Judge Henry C.
Caldwell, United States circuit Judge of
Arkansas, and a great esadidate he will
make them. His deciaeos on labor
qestlouns have attracted the attention
a the whol seeontry and he is a man
.of great ablity and ru charascter.

Let the Populiqts be prepared to re
celve t(1, new recruits. Let us prove
ourselves equal to the occasion by ac
knowledging that the Populist party
has no special plan of salvation, asid(
from the $t-ichings of Jefferson. Jack
son, Lincoln and Blaine. If there it
any one thing that will Ihsturb the re
lations of silver men of all parties at
St. Lo:is it w!ll be the c-otism of some
Populist who will Inals; that our party
has originated the ,~ancial, transpor
tation and land issues. They are all old
issues.. Ninety-nine out of every hun
dred Populists know this, but it is the
one-hundredth fellow that is to be
feared. Populists forced them to the
front as issues. We should be care
ful in dealing with the bolters from the
old parties by not claiming too much.
As soon as they are reminded that the
greatest portion of the Omaha plat
form is taken from the teachings of the
leaders of the old parties (leaders when
the old parties Were honest) they will
be more enthusiastic in joining out
ranks. It is trio that the great ma
jority of silver men who will go to
St. Louis with a view of joining forces
tinder the Populist banner' will not be
found well posted on the transportas
tion and land planks, direct legislation.
etc. And for that tery reason we must
be lenient with them. A man is natur*
ally opposed to that which he does not
fully understand. So when we fnd them
opposing our minor planks we must not
accuse them o: trying to steal us. We
should remember, too, that some of the
most substantial supporters of the
transportation and land planks that we
have in our patty came in as believers
in free silver oly. It is very likely
that the three or four million of voters
who will come into our party through
the medium ot the St. Louis silver con
vention, will in the end willingly yield
the truth of the transportation and
land planks.
We are not going to bave as ichb
trouble over land transportation and
direct legislation as some of us are
wont to predict. As it looks to a mas
up a tree the silver men, as a whole,
will be willing to adopt the Populist
platform as it is, provided there is s
chance of escaping the tariff issue. Pro
tection is very near to the heart of the.
average free sliverite an. some of them
may want to have a high tariff plank
It is bet that high tariff agitation be
kept out of the convention whether of
fered as a sop to Pepublican stllverites
or from honest convictions. But he
who attempts to keep it out may have
an uneomfortable job on his hands.
There is only one question upon
which we are all thoroughly agreed
and that is that the tree and unlimlted
coinage of silver is the all important is.
