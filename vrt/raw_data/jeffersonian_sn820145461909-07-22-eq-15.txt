mountain in the world, in Alaska,
and heaps of others.”
His mother regarded her son with
looks of pride, and Lauretta thought
he must know almost as much as the
doctor and Miss Lathrop.
“I’ve hearn ’em call our moun
tains the Blue Ridge,” she said tim
idly. “We-uns come from North
Ca’lina.”
“North Ca’lina is a far ways,” said
the boy; “you ain’t aimin’ to walk
it?”
“No, I’m aimin’ to take the cyars
some place. I got money ’nough for
a ticket if I knowed where to get it.”
“What’s the name of the place you
live at in North Ca’lina?” asked the
boy.
“We-uns lives in the mountains,
but pap hauls apples and taters to
Ashby twelve miles from home; if I
git to Ashby I kin walk the balance
of the way.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “all you got to
do is to keep on till you get to Clay
ville —it’s fifteen miles from here,
and tell the ticket agent you want to
go to Ashby, N. C. He’ll tell you how
to get there, all right.”
“I’m more’n obliged to you,” said
Lauretta gratefully; “it’s fine to
know how to read and write. I donno
as I’d ever got home if you hadn’t
told me how.”
The next morning, after breakfast
was eaten and the baby fed and
bathed —her hospital experience had
taught her the necessity of cleanli
ness—Lauretta started forth on her
journey to Clayville. Her kind hostess
had given her a package of food, and
at noon she rested by the roadside
and ate, and fed the baby. A short
hour of rest, then on again, for Clay
ville must be reached and the ticket
for home secured. Walking was
easier, for the road was now clay in
stead of sand. The country was more
cultivated, too. She passed well
kept farms and comfortable dwell
ings. People in buggies and wagons
passed her on the road. A kind-look
ing farmer, going to town with a load
of “truck,” offered her a ride, help
ing her and the baby up to the seat
beside him. It was very pleasant to
ride, even on a jolting wagon. Lau
retta rested, and the baby stared and
babbled as she watched the horses.
“Mighty purty baby,” said the man
admiringly. Lauretta glowed. “Boy
or gal?”
“Gal,” said Lauretta. “Her pappy’s
dead, and me’n her air gwine up to
the mountains —to my mammy.”
“I ’low you aim to take the train
at Clayville?” said the farmer.
“Yes, sir. Do you know when the
train starts for Ashby, N. C.?”
“They’s a train north leaves ’bout
dark. I’ll take ye to the depot and
buy your ticket fer ye; ’tain’t much,
but it’ll be helpin’ ye along a little
grain.”
‘ Thanky, sir,” replied Lauretta
simply.
Arriving at the station, she took
the tobacco bag from her bosom, and
gave the money to the stranger with
perfect faith —faith in no wise mis
placed, for after making minute in
quiry concerning the route and buy
ing the ticket, the farmer slipped
two silver dollars of his own money
in the bag, that she might have plenty
for other needs. Then, finding the
conductor of the outgoing train, he
explained that Lauretta was a widow,
all alone save for the baby, that she
wished to go to Ashby, N. C., and
that the conductor must take special
care of her, which he faithfully did.
Seated in the car, with the train
going at full speed, Lauretta drew a
breath of deep, exulting relief. Her
baby was safe! The nurse and the
law could never reach her in the
mountains.
The long night in the uncomfort
able day coach was over at last, and
the conductor had seen Lauretta and
her baby safely on the next train —
the train that was to bear her straight
to Ashby. She would arrive about
noon, the conductor said.
When at last the train drew into
the station how beautiful seemed the
familiar scenes to Lauretta’s eyes.
The way was plain now, she was al
most home! A psalm of thanksgiv
ing was singing in her heart as she
set foot on her native soil.
She bought a bag of cakes for the
baby from the station lunch counter,
pinned a shawl tightly over the little
one’s head —the mountain air was
chilly—and set bravely forth on the
weary stretch of road that lay be
tween her and her father’s house.
A mountaineer coming home from
Ashby overtook her before she had
in.
A year slowly dragged itself away.
Every night, when the weather was
cool, old man Petticord placed a pile
of corn in the corner where Big Lige’s
chair had always stood. People said
that Millie was dying of a broken
heart, because her husband persisted
in throwing himself away. Brezen
tine would not work, and many a
morning, when the snow lay deep on
the ground, old man Petticord was
seen carrying meat and corn-meal to
his daughter and her worthless hus
band.
One evening in December old man
Petticord and his wife sat by the
great log fire. The pile of corn was
in its place, and the great chair, with
its raw-hide bottom, stood in the cor
ner.
“Last Chris’mus Big Lige wuz with
us,” said the old man.
“Yas,” his wife responded, “an’ I
wush he wuz with us now. Somehow
I never did think he wuz guilty. He
alius loved Millie, an’
“Wall, wall,” said the old man,
“why the hell didn’t you let her mar
ry him? Hush now, hush. We won’t
argy. We’ve been livin’ together too
long ter argy at this late day. Who’s
that at the door? Come in. Why’
it’s Scott Patterson. Come in,
Scott.”
“I’ve got some putty bad news,”
said Patterson, as he advanced and
placed his hands on the back of a
chair. “Jes’ airter dinner terday Jim
Polk Brezentine come out ter the
cross-roads an’ got putty full. Long
toward evenin’, he got on his mule
an’ galloped off, but he hadn’t gone
fur tell the mule flung him agin a
tree. We tuck him home, an’ the
doctor says he kain’t git well. Yer’d
all better come 'over ter his house,”

BIG LIGE
(CONCLUDED FROM LAST WEEK’S ISSUE)
walked many miles, and gave her a
ride in his cart as his road lay near
her home. When the slow-moving
oxen stopped at the driver’s “turn
ing-off place” it was quite dark.
There was only a short distance to
walk. Lauretta hugged the baby to
her bosom. “Oh, precious,” she
whispered raptuously, “we’re here!
We’ve done got home!”
Up the steep path she climbed, joy
speeding her feet. The cabin door
■was closed to the chilly night, but she
could hear the beloved voices within.
The yard dog rose with a growl as
she entered the gate—a growl which
was quickly changed to a yelp of joy
as she called to him softly. Creeping
to the uncurtained window she look
ed in. Her father sat before the
blazing log fire, polishing a powder
horn with a piece of broken glass;
the children were roasting apples and
sweet potatoes in the fire; in the
chimney corner the mother stood be
side her wheel, spinning the coarse
yarn. And as she spun she softly
sang one of the old songs—the songs
from over-sea.
Earth had no higher joy to offer
Lauretta. She opened the door and
stood upon the threshold of her
home.
They hurried over to Brezentine’s
house. The wretched man, moaning
and groaning, was, the physician
said, beyond all hope. When the
medical man told him that he could
live but a few hours longer, he howl
ed like a wild beast.
“Oh, God will send my soul to
hell,” he cried. “Millie, Millie, come
here. Lige did not steal the money.
I stole it, and he went to the peniten
tiary to shield you. God forgive me
fer”—
He became speechless. Tears
streamed down Petticord’s face, but
they were not in sympathy for Brez
entine. Mrs. Petticord, taking Millie
into her arms, whispered:
“B’ar up ez well ez yer ken. The
Lord will bring all things right.”
A profound sensation was created
when the people heard of Brezentine’s
confession, and when they turned
away from a new grave in an old
orchard one of the Dye boys re
marked:
“I never throwed dirt on a triflin
’er man.”
The night was bitterly cold. It
was the night before Christmas, and
“old Quinzy” Petticord, his wife and
his daughter sat by the blazing fire.
Millie had just placed Lige’s chair in
its accustomed position, when the old
man remarked:
“I reckon that pertition we sent
down ter the guv-ner will do ther
work. He kain’t keep Big Lige in
thar a day airter he knows the truth.
Now, Millie, don’t cry ’round here.
I ’spise ter see people a-snufflin’. I
know in reason he—open the door,
Millie; don’t yer hear somebody?”
Millie opened the door. Big Lige
stepped into the room. The old man
seized the giant; the old woman, as
her husband afterward remarked,
fluttered like a duck, and Millie, as-
ter she had shaken hands with Lige,
wiped her eyes on her apron and
took her old seat, just across the
hearth from Lige’s chair. Lige sat
down, took up an ear of corn, as
though he had just come in from the
stable, and began to shell it.
“Millie,” the old woman cried, as
she wiped her eyes, “go an’ fix Lige’s
supper, fur I know he ain’t had nuth
in’ ter eat sence he left here. Pore
Lige!”
“Don’t pity me,” Lige replied.
“Why,” the old man asked, “ain’t
they nearly worked yer ter death
down thar?”
“Shar, no; it wa’n’t no trouble
a-tall to keep up with them fellers.”
“While Millie’s gettin’ supper
ready let me tell yer the news,” said
the old man. “Sim Bumpus an’ Sal
lie Patterson is married. ’Squire
Boyle is down with the rheumatiz.
He has been on the lift for three
months. We have been all well, ’cept
myself. I’ve been putty stretchy a
time or two, but I ain’t been bed
sick sence yer left us. Thank God,
Big Lige, that yer air with us wunst
more. I reckon Millie’s got yer snack
about ready. All she had ter do wuz
ter put it on ther table. Come.”
“Big Lige,” said the old woman,
as the giant arose from his seat, “I
couldn’t think no mo’ uv yer es yer
was my natril borned son.”
*******
Six months had passed. Big Lige,
who would not permit himself to be
a hero, avoided company, shelled his
corn and made his collars for the
work-horses. Old man Petticord was
happy again, and the old lady, con
stantly requested not to “argy,”
seemed not to have ever had a mo
ment of trouble.
It was Saturday, and the old man
and his wife had gone to “meetin’ ”
down at the ford. Big Lige sat in
the “big room,” engaged in making
a new bottom for a chair. Millie
came in from the kitchen. She looked
at Lige and blushed. The giant be
came confused.
“Oh, Big Lige,” said the girl, “let
me tell you something awful.”
She knelt down on the floor beside
him and said:
“Long time ago a person done me
an’ yerse’f a great wrong. One day
when we killed hogs Sallie Patterson
told me that you said this to her:
’Sallie, Millie loves me, an’ es she
don’t marry me she will die; but I
don’t kere—l am goin’ ter ask her,
an’ when she says yes I am goin’ ter
laugh’—wait till I get through—‘in
her face. She alius has been tryin’
ter ketch me. Then when yer asked
me, Big Lige, I couldn’t he’p but say:
‘No, I thanks yer.’ ”
“Did Sallie say that?”
“Yas, she did.”
“I wish she wuz a man. “Es she
wuz ez big ez Samson I could slam
her agin the face of the yeath.”
“Oh, Lige,” she said, clasping her
hands, “won’t yer furgive me?”
“Angel,” he said, as he took her in
his arms, “I aint got nothin’ ter fur
give. I would die fur yer.”
“Lige, I have loved yer ever sence
I wuz a little gal, but I thought yer
hated me.”
When the old man and the old
woman returned they found two hap
py souls; and when Lige said, “We
air goin’ ter git married,” the old
couple, with one voice, exclaimed:
“Thank the Lawd!”
(the end.)
