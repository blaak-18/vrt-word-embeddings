OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
A SOUTH CAROLINA COUSIN.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Is there room
in your happy band for a little South
Carolina girl nine years old, with
fair complexion and blue eyes,
weight sixty-three pounds? I live
three miles from the little town of
Kline. I like to live on the farm,
and help mamma with the house
work. I like to go to school. lam
in the twelfth grade. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian and the Magazine
and reads them more than any. I
like to read the Post-Card Club and
the “Dark Corner” in the Magazine.
I hope this will not reach the waste
basket. —Your new cousin, Eunice
Owens, R. F. D., Kline, S. C.
ANOTHER RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
for the first time. I live in the fine
old State of Georgia and like it very
much. Well, the year of 1909 will
soon be gone, and then a New Year
will be here. Daddy Jim, how did
you spend Xmas? I spent it fine,
and Santa Claus came Xmas. I will
write again if this is in print. I will
send a riddle, and then I will close.
Little thing! Guess! In her white
dress, with her red nose; the longer
she stands the shorter she grows,
and when she dies she’ll have a black
nose.—Lee Ray, Bowman, Ga.
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a girl
thirteen years old. I live in the
country, three miles northwest of
Fitzgerald. Papa takes The Jeffer
sonian and I sure do enjoy the Post-
Card Club. Papa and mamma send
their love to Mr. Watson. —I am your
new friend, Florence Swords, Rt. 6,
Fitzgerald, Ga.
PROBLEM IN ARITHMETIC.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you ad
mit a little Alabama girl into your
Post-Card Club? lam thirteen years
old and weigh seventy-one pounds.
I am going to school and am in the
seventh and eighth grades. Our
schoolhouse was very small last win
ter, but by the help of the State they
have been able to make it larger,
and have bought a nice set of furni
ture for it. Our teacher’s name is
Miss Eva Lindsay. I like her very
much. Papa made 270 gallons of
syrup on one-half acre; who can beat
that? We have killed five nice hogs.
Papa voted for Mr. Watson in the
last election, for President, and said
if they had all voted their honest
conviction he would have received a
large majority. Papa takes Mr.
Watson’s Jeffersonian and Magazine,
and I read the children’s page every
week. Mama raises the Rhode Is
land Red chickens and has as pretty
ones as I have ever seen. Papa has
two mules and one horse. I can ride
the horse anywhere. I have three
brothers and three sisters living, and
one little sister dead. I live far out
in the country. I wish some of the
cousins would solve this problem for
me: A passenger train sixty-five
yards long met a freight train going
half as fast. If they passed each
other in five seconds, how long was
the freight train? —Grace Shields,
Vineland, Ala.
HAD A GOOD TIME.
Dear Daddy Jim:—As I never
wrote to The Jeffersonians before, I
will write and tell you boys and
girls what a nice time I had Christ
mas. Old Santa came to see me and
brought me some nuts, oranges, ap
ples, candies, bananas, grapes, and a
pretty book. lam a little girl four
teen years old, have sandy hair, light
complexion, and blue eyes. I like
to go to school. lam in the seventh
grade. Professor Oscar Horton is
my teacher and I like him. Kittie
Hatcher is my deskmate. We have
one hundred and forty scholars on
roll. They are building us a new
Cshe TUcffersonian.
schoolhouse. Papa takes The Jef
fersonian and I like to read it. I
will close, hoping to see my letter in
print.—Maud Scott, Rt. 6, Boaz, Ala.
j
ANOTHER FROM ALABAMA.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you allow
a little Alabama girl to enter your
happy band? lam twelve years old
and have fair complexion, light hair
and blue eyes. I go to school every
day and like it. I like to read the
letters in the Post-Card Club. Papa
thinks Mr. Watson is the greatest
man in the world. I have two pet
kittens and like to play with them.
I like to help mamma with the
housework. I will write again soon
if this escapes the waste-basket. —
Your new cousin, Georgia Keller,
Rt. 1, Eva, Ala.
ROOM FOR ONE MORE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—ls there room
in your happy band for a little Geor
gia girl eleven years old, with fair
complexion and brown eyes, weight
seventy-one pounds? I live in the
country, one mile from the little
town of Bartow. I like to live on
the farm and like to go to school. I
am in the sixth grade. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian and likes it very
much. I enjoy reading the letters
in the Post-Card Club. Well, will
close; hope this will not reach the
waste-basket. Your new writer,
Sallie Lou Black, Bartow, Ga.
FOURTH ATTEMPT.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
again. This is my fourth attempt.
I am nine years old. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian and Magazine and
I like to read the letters in them. I
have two sisters and one brother.
Mr. Watson, I hope to see you Presi
dent some time.—Bessie Haslerig,
Rt. 4, LaFayette, Ga.
WHAT IS IT?
Dear Daddy Jim:—As I have been
reading The Jeffersonian and saw the
little folks’ letters, I thought I would
write too. lam thirteen years old,
dark hair, brown eyes, and dark
complexion. I go to school at Elk
Ridge. My teacher’s name is Mr.
Bennie Thompson, but my school is
out now. I saw in The Jeffersonian
a riddle asked by Lillie May Tilley.
I think the answer is a lightning
bug. As this is my first letter, I will
close. I will give a riddle: What
is it that goes with a wagon and it
is not of any use, and the wagon
can’t turn without it?—Virgie Lee
Wagner, Rt. 6, Lewisburg, Tenn.
FROM WESTERN TEXAS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have been
reading your page of correspondents,
and not seeing anything from my
home thought I would write to you.
I am fourteen years old, have grey
eyes and black hair. I have been
going to school, but have stopped
now for Xmas. I have a good teach
er and am in the seventh and eighth
grades; would have been higher, but
we don’t have very good teachers out
here in the West, in the country.
My father takes Mr. Watson’s Maga
zine and The Jeffersonian both, and
sure likes to read them. Has sold a
good many, and gives away nearly
all of his after he reads them. I live
eight miles from Big Springs, on a
farm. We made eighteen bales of
cotton this year. Most of the farm
ers around here made from three to
four bales. I have six brothers and
two sisters living. I have two half
sisters; they are married, and one of
my brothers is in Alaska. We only
hear from him about every two
months in the winter. I have no
pets, but mamma has a canary, a
cat, and a few others not worth
mentioning. I will close for fear I
will write too much. —Your friend,
May Bynum, Gale Route, Big
Springs, Texas.

PLAIN TRUTH
A MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 32 PAGES
By J. A. SCARBORO,
A Son of Georgia, Minister and
Student.
This Magazine is digging up and
exposing corruption and graft in
- “Missions”. Its Editor has studied
the subject fifteen years, published
two books on the subject and knows
what he is doing. Dr. J. N. Hall,
late Editor of the Baptist Flag, the
most widely circulated Baptist pa
per in the South, with whom Scar
boro was associated as Editor of
that paper, said of him: “J. A. Scar
boro is the best inforrqed man on
missions in America.” The cham
pions of the present system have
declined to meet him in both press
and on rostrum. His Magazine is
full of facts, evidence and argu
ments which can not be refuted. He
is Treasurer of the General Asso
ciation of Baptist Churches, and has
the confidence and enjoys the en
dorsement of his brethren. He is
Pastor of one of the best churches
in the land and just in his prime
and in the thickest of the battle for
truth and righteousness.
