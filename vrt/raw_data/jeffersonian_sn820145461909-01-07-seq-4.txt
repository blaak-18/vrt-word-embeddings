A GIFT.
I do not come to claim a gift of you,
Since gifts are not for friendship’s
tongue to ask;
But would you crown me with content
most true,
Give me the word of courage for
my task.
Give me the word of courage, that
will stand
Close to my soul upon the battle
field;
Give me your faith to nerve my weak
ling hand;
Give me a motto for my battered
shield.
Give me the truth, to lean on in the
night;
Give me the fellowship of kindred
soul;
Then stand aside, and give me room
to fight,
A fair road, unimpeded, to my
goal.
I do not ask your laurel wreath and
crown,
'Since are mine to win, not
yours to give;
A bit of earth at last to lay me
down,
A fair field for my courage, while
I live.
I do not ask your frankincense and
gold,
Nor claim a tribute of your
praise;
Since Fate ever, at the finish, bold,
And for dead brows has still some
• laggard bays.
I do not wish a grudging hand to
clasp,
Nor roses, where my feet have felt
the stone;
But leave me hand-free for my good
sword’s grasp;
Give me a fair field, since I fight
alone.
And so I do not come to claim a gift
Os frankincense, or honors, at your
hand;
But as ray cross up Calvary I lift,
Throw me a signal that you under
stand.
—Will Allen Dromgoole, in Nashville

THE RISE OF SNOBBERY.
The Southern papers a few short
months ago were full of a startling
sensation.
A well educated hard-working
young fellow, of good family, had,
by the means known as “eloping,”
taken to himself a wife, who was a
pretty, demure, little maiden of the
South, and one who, if all reports be
true, was just the kind to make any
susceptible young man fall in love
with her and want her as his own,
whether by the ordinary church wed
ding or the romantic elopement. For
the fact that a young man and a
young girl choose to step over to the
Under The Vine and Tig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
parson’s, without a flourish of trum
pets, and get married should in this
day and time create no very great
commotion. So what was the mat
ter? Simply this —the young fellow
wanted to make his own way in the
world; he was an adept at managing
an auto; he was working for a sal
ary that was largely in excess of that
of the average salesman, more than
many a young professional man could
command, and, if he dignified his
calling by doing it well, stood as a
king among men, asking no one to
credit him for his tailor bill and
beating no one out of his board. One
kind of labor being as honorable a»
another, he stood in as honorable a
position as the President who labors
with his brains, or the snob whose
father made his pile over the dry
goods counter. But, the girl—oh,
well, she happened to belong to a
daddy who had grown rich —who had
probably been to Europe and soaked
in notions of the old world class dis
tinctions and came back with the no
tion that the wrapping up of the
past in a pile of dollars, or the salt
ing down of the present in a brine
of bonds made his own and only a
little better than the common herd
who had not yet gotten as big a store,
or been to Yurrup and dined with
the “Dooks. ”
Well, the girl and the boy drove
together in the automobile, but the
boy was the hireling, and her fath
er’s chauffeur, and no one thought
anything possible between them, un
til one fine morning nature asserted
herself, and the good looking boy
and the good looking girl turned up
man and wife under the laws of the
State and the laws of God. Then the
tempest broke. The horrible details
went over the wires that the rich
Miss Bondholder had manned the fel
low who ran the automobile for the
family; and Mamma Bondholder
went to bed with the smelling salts
and sent for the doctor and the law
yer, and the Governor was appealed
to, and the commotion was greater
than ever before in the house of
Bondholder. And then did Mamma
Bondholder arise, and taking Miss
Bondholder by the hand (she who
was now Mrs. Chauffeur) did lead
her away to the pleasant fields and
sunny pastures of Yurrup to forget
the honest face of her husband, and
join the army of the divorcees, if
the courts could be prevailed upon
to grant a divorce, for the reason that
a nice looking young lady saw fit to
marry a nicely behaved young fellow
who happened to be engaged in mak
ing his own living by driving a Gas
Buggy. That’s all there is to it; but
behind it all is the fact that the age
of snobbery is upon us. The time
when the fellow who sold shoe strings
or folding beds and got rich can say
to the fellow who has brains enough
to sell mechanical skill, “Dog of a
serf, out of my sight, approach not
near lest thou defile the greenbacks
that wrap me, lest thy hands pollute
me, for the scales have weighed us
The Jeffersonian
and my dollars bear you down.”
The day when the farmer, who
lives at home and serves his God as
an honest man, can say, I AM A
KING, is over.
The day when the smith can look
up from his forge and say,' as long
as I do my duty I am as great as the
greatest.
The day when honest toil is digni
fied has fled, and the dollar rules.
Take care, Messrs. Bondholders and
Goldbugs, and don’t let a good look
ing young fellow drive your gas
wagon in future, for good looking
girls and nice looking young men
have away of jumping over the fence
that divides the dollar and the man.
C. H. Beazley.
(This is essentially sound, but no
defense can be made of the conduct
of the young man’s father, in the
case to which the writer refers.

LITERATURE OF GLOOM
By P. J. Campbell.
Some say that the age of romance
is passing and that an age of realism
is being ushered in, that the idealism
of romance belongs to the days of
myth and heroic legend, when the
supernatural was at premium and the
natural below par. Today we take
life as we find it; we take things as
they are without apology or excuse
and deny ourselves any fanciful de
ceptions. We do not want any more
than the truth. It is not sufficient
any longer that a tale be beautiful;
it must make good, it must prove
out. Only the genuine is worth while.
But realism sometimes runs away
with itself as badly as romance ever
has. The passion for painting life
black is as extreme as the passion for
painting it rosy. The melancholy sat
isfaction that a realist indulges in
tragedy, or near tragedy, is often
equal to the romancer’s delight in
Utopian dreams.
Ibsen showed us the seamy side of
life and George Bernard Shaw gives
us horrible examples skillfully por
trayed. Upton 'Sinclair told us the
consummate woe of Packington;
Walter Hurt makes out the Mine
Owners’ Association a hideous mons
ter; and Joseph Medell Patterson
places on exhibition a tainted section
of society.
The literature of gloom, taken by
itself, is very depressing. It pro
motes a belief in the doctrine of to
tal depravity, shakes our faith in hu
manity—and when a man’s faith in
his brother is destroyed he has also
lost faith in himself.
Herbert Spencer said that the first
requisite was to be a good animal.
That is, without the animal founda-

tion, the structure of our civilization
cannot be reared. So to deplore the
animal nature is to deplore a neces
sity. The sooner we all learn to be
natural and honest and open in our
lives the better it will be. It is no
disgrace to be human, but it is a dis
grace to be a hypocrite living behind
the mask of convention and the blind
of formality.
When we have reduced life to a
true basis; when we are natural and
unaffected and honest absolutely;
when hypocrisy and diplomacy have
become superfluous, then we will not
lavish so much gilding upon love and
romance, but neither will we paint
humanity so black as some of our so
called realists are
Human nature is rich in crude, ani
mal passion. It has been the task of
civilization to turn these motive
forces to the good of the human fam
ily, and when so directed they are
beautiful and right. To hold the ani
mal passions of man up in a contemp
tuous light, awakening sickening dis
gust in the reader, is to overreach
poet’s license. Misdirected energy is
always disgusting or ridiculous, but
the child does not walk the first time
it tries. has to learn and devel
op by experiment and exercise, and
when at last the limbs serve the will
their awkwardness is forgotten in
their usefulness. So with the pas
sion of hunger, sex, ambition, power.
‘They are our motive forces. Improp
erly directed they equal the wildest
dreams of hell: properly directed
they realize the fairest visions of
heaven.
WHERE THERE’S A WILL.
Shortly before the Christmas 'holi
days one year a Princeton undergrad
uate from vhicago wished to start
home, thus gaining a week’s vacation
on the other students. He had, how
ever, used up all the absences from
recitations which are allowed, and
any more without good excuse would
have meant suspension. In a quan
dary, he hit upon this solution: He
telegraphed his father the following
message:
“Shall I come home by the B. and
0. or straight home?”
The answer he received read:
“Come straight home.”
An exhibition of the telegram to
the faculty,was sufficient. —Success
