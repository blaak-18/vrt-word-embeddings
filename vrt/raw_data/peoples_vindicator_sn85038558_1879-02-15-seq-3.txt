CRAND ECORE 1ROAD.
Are We to be Cot Ofrom Ue River
This Is Certata Unle ss e. d
thring heb Base. ii
Enough lass been written about tihe %
"Grand Ecore road" in the past twen- I
ty years to have paved it with paper. b
It is certainly tilme that "chin unmusic" a
should cease and somne work be done. I
F The parish will do all it can to aid in ii
whatever labor may be nsuggested or :
expended and our city most do the a
rest. We beg to ask of our citizens a
the serious consideration of this sub. b
ject, and to ask themselvese which will e
be cheaper, to abandon Grand Ecore a
as a freight depot and go to some h
point on the river East-Guooney's or li
Tessier's-or to repair the road to el
our ancient bshipping point. In the si
consideration of a removal we know ri
that we have a river to cross as well fi
as a new road to cut out all the way. I
But this road is through sandy soil I
while the old route has a bayou Boar- tl
ben: swamp, and that stream to be d
repaired and bridged. Grand Ecore *
is a good point, on the other bsad, 6
for oar shippers. We have no river tl
to Cros to reacm It, aou a ~"ss ueOs
our port for time immemorial. To
make a good road, however, requires na
plank or corderoy from the top of t
Badin's hill to the bayou bridge. This, d
we fear, will cost much money. Still I
it can be done and is worth all that P
may be expended apon it. Let our city na
government and our parochial fathers cl
put their heads together and devise a
plan to reader passable this most im
portant thoroughfare. Unless they
do we will be eat of during the wet
season from Grad Ecore entirely. a

Their Condition-A Suggestd ed de of C
Repair for the City Government, C
About to be Installed, to I
Grapple-The a
nidewalks. p
We suppose it is useless to call at
tention to the condition of our streets.
They are the subject of universal
comment and complaint, and the
unaniamous sentiment is-that some
thing must be done to put them io
proper condition. The VrNDcArTOa
begs to submit a mode by which we
think our streets can be pat In repair
at very little coat. It is by the pas
sage of an ordinance requiatring every
peson within the corporate limits, be
tween the ages of eighteen and fifty
five, to work opon the streets of the w
city for not exceeding twelve days in P
each year. In default of such work it
they should be made to furnish a sub- P
stitute or pay one dollar per day for
every day they may be in default into a
the city treasury. The saum of mo- e
aey so paid ia tbe expended lu re
pairing streets. Shoud persons Ii
ble to streot du rfs to frah sab- d
etitutes or pay the one dllar per day, ni
then they sheold be Gaed In sash to
sum a may be necessary to enforee
bethelaw;eid buss and costs to be 51
paid in eash or by work onthe Y
streets. By this means a large
amouon of work can be done and ab
large street fund aeeamalated with- r'
out bearing down on real estate, el
which is now burdened with as much
taxation as it ca carry. Our side.
walks should be put Ia repair, whicb
can be done at very little eost to the
owner of property and it is to his In- ti
torest that these pavement shaold * a
lI good eeditlon for it adds to the q
vanlsethe property. On all streets U
in rear of the eity sdewalks should )
be bilt of briek or plank. The lat
terare good and cheap. Say that b
walks of two iocb plank twenrtyfour
lnches wide sboald be constructed. i
This will put all lots now valueless
in market beease people would buy d
sadbuld fortheresseustiyseeldg
at them naill weather without hsg.a
gig down. Natehitaeehs san's stand
still. If heriope want Imr t goto
ruin they have only to follow the
course now beiag pursued. If they
want her to move forward, something
like our sugestions must bhe ang
gurated and maintained.
