HARRISON'S PO3ITION
Ie Would 8eleet x One Ba sllmef fet -
President,
John C New, tiho was the figith
hand man of El1-President Harrison in
1688, and is so yet for all that is known
to the contrary, has been interviewed
as to the position of his chiefL Mince
his statements have not been contra
dicted by Gen. Harrison, or by any
friend of his, it can be taltdd i i:
granted that they oe "inspired."
It seems, then, that the attitude of
the ex-president is the conventional
one of the priest who is called on to be
a bishop, who does not want the, office
and dreads its responsibilities, but
who accepts it in obedience to i sol
emn sense oft duty. Gen. Harrison is
not a candidate, saya Mr. New. "LHe
will not enter into the struggle for a
nomination which could not bring him
any more honor,, but which would
bring hltn more cares." But it he
should be called to active leadership
by the party "he will assumae the duty
as a.trust from whith his patriotism'
will not allow him to shrink." This is
the language of an "ancient Roman
rather than a modern Jndianian,
If vox populi said '"General, you
must exchange the peaceful seclusion
of your home for the-.laborious turmoil
of the white house," Mr. New says au
thoritatively he would pack up and go,
and Mr. New is of the opinion that wok
populi is going to do that verything.
He says the "unmistakable drift of pub
lic sentiment" is liarrisonward.
But in order that that draft may
not be checked and turned in another
direction Mr. New announces that
"were Gen. Harrison's advice solicited
he would select neither Mr. McKinley
nor Mr. Reed as the republican candi
date for president."
In other words, "public sentiment"
is warned that if out of regard for Mr.
Harrison's preference for a private life
lie is not called on to-be a candidate, it
will not do to select either of the two
other men who are the leading aspi
rants for the nomination. While very
unwilling to be nominated, Gen. Har
rison explains that it would be unsafe
to nominate anyone else, and his
friends are working hard to prevent
the commission of such a blunder.
What Mr. New had to say on behalf
of his chief could have been put in
very few words. Gen. Harrison is
anxious to be renominated and reelect
ed. He is a candidate for the nomina
ion, and through his friends is work
ng hard to get -it. Recognizing the
fact that Messrs. Reed and McKinley
are at this moment his most formida
ble competitors he takes the trouble
to point out what he considers their
weak spots. One stands for a bill
which cost the party two defeats and
stands for nothing else. The other he
alleges is responsible for the heavy ap
propriations of the Fifty-first con
gress.
As an old politician Mr. New ought
to have known that it would have been
better to say Gen. Harrison yearns
exceedingly for the nomination and
means to get it if he can rather than to
print him as a Cincinnatus at the
plow with his head turned over his
shoulder looking impatiently for the
arrival of the senators to inform him
of his election and begging his friends
to hurry them up.-Chicago Tribune
(Rep.).
HE WANTS REVENGE.
Reasons for arrisus's Oppositlon to Mic
Kinley and Reed.
It was the billion-dollar congress, of
which Mr. Reed of Maine was speaker,
and Mr. McKinley of Ohio was chair
man of the ways and means commit
tee, that passed the notorious high
tariff measure known as the McKinley
bill Mr. Harrison was president of
the United States, and it required his
signature to make it a law. In the
election following the McKinley bill,
the democrats and low-tax men swept
the c>untry, notwithstanding that the
manufacturers, who were the only
class benefited by the law, contributed
large campaign sums for the success
of the high protection cause.
The republican journals, comment
ing on the result of the election and
the causes thatb led to it, universally
admitted that the passage of the Me.
Kinley bill was the chief cause for the
republican disaster. Those few per
sons who held the confidence of 'resi
dent Harrison openly stated that Mr.
Reed, as speaker of the house, had
been warned by the president against
the extravagant appropriations being
made, and that Mr. McKinley, as chair
man of the ways and means committee,
had been advised by the president not
to build the tariff duties too high.
The president's advice and wishes
were disregarded, and when tae crush
ing rebuke of the people fell pon the
administration and hurled it from
power the friends of Gen. llarrison,
if not the president himself, blamed
Reed and McKinley for the misfortune
to the party. Certain it is that from
the election in 189[0 up to the present
time Gen. Harrison has had no love for
either Reed or McKinley. Therefore
the statemenL of Mr. New that were
his (Harrison's) advice solicited he
would select neither Mr. McKinley nor
Mr. Reed as the republican candidate
for president will cause no surprise in
those circles where the factsl above
noted are so well known. Nor will the
announcement that Gen. Harrison is
not a candidate for president cause
any surprise among observant politi
eians.-Louisville Courier-JournaL
---It is quite flattering to Doss
Quay that there should be a report
that the chairman of the republican
executive committee of Ohio waited
upon him and asked him to express no
presidental preference until after the
November election in that sitate. It
-puts him in the light of president
maker and boss almighty-a dictator
for the whole republican party. It will
"be strange if Boss Platt does not sooner
or later exhibit some jealousy of so all
prevading a boss.-St. Louis Post
Dispatch.

OIL WELLS DRYING UP.
rears That the Supply Winl Soon Be Ex
Laasted In the East.
The great decline in the oil products
of Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio in
a recent period, and the fear that the
wells in those states might become ex
nausted before many years, have
stimulated act'vely in the search for
sew fields. Within the' last year in
Cansas, Arkansas, southern California,
:he Indian territory and in various
fther regions oil wells have been dis
-overed where the existence of the
valuable fluid was never suspected.
Mtuch attention has recently been given
to the Indian territory, whose wealth
of minerals has long been known. On
the borders of the Indian reservations
,n both Cansas and Arkansas rich
-oal and oil fields have been found; but
these are regarded as merely outcrop
pings of the principal fields in the In
lian territory. Experts who have ex
plored these fields declare that in this
-egion abundant wells of oil and nat
aral gas are struck at a depth .of two
hundre3 feet, and that the deepest
borings do not go lower than twelve
hundred feet. In the Pennsylvania oil
-egions the wells must be sunk to a
lepth of eighteen hundred to twenty
four hundred feet. It is stated that
the oil of the Indian territory is better
for illuminating purposes than any
other that has yet been discovered.
The city of Los Angeles, Cal., appears
to stand upon an oil field, as borings
made in the heart of that city at half
the depth of Pennsylvania sources have
Fielded rich results. Not long ago a
well was sunk at the intersection of
two streets to a depth of eight hun
ired feet, when the oil flowed out at
the rate of eight hundred barrels a day.
in other parts of Californiacompanies
have been formed to develop the fields
of oil and natural gas, of which the
indications are abundant. The fact
thar in California much of the land
overlying this wealth is prolific in ag
ricultural products . has caused its
Treater subterranean value to be over
Looked. But it will not be long until
the oil producer's derrick shall arise
among its vineyards and corn fields.
After making all allowances for ex
aggeration there remains no doubt
that this great country contains rich
Belds of oil and natural gas that still
tLie undeveloped. Should the flids of
Pennsylvania become wholly exhaust
ad there would be no want of petroleum
ror both home consumption and export.

HATS OF MULL.
Beauty and Comfort Are Combined Ina
Hats for the Little Ones.
The little maid of to-day listens in
wonderment to tales of grandma's
childhood, and in her innocent way
dreams of the children who roamed
about with sunbonnets on their heads.
She thinks they must certainly have
been very queer.
IBut my little lady does not under
stand that she herself is wearing a sun
bonnet. True, it is not like those of
yore. It has a new quality, that which
the mother of the little maid strives
to develop in her daughter.
It is emancipated. No longer is it
made of hot gingham, which jars one's
nerves every time it touches the ears;
neither is it coarse and ugly.
It is made of finest mull, in dainty
colors and trimmed with lace or Irish
point embroidery. The sunbonnet is
so light and cool that the little maid
does not mind having it on her head in
the least.
The crown of the bonnet is made
very full and a cape of embroidery
hangs about the neck. A wide ruche,
also of embroidery, encircles the face.
The little maid does not always wear
sunbonnets, however. There is anoth
er style of head covering for her and
she wears it quite as often as the bon
net.
Again it is of mull, but this time
over a stiff wire frame. The wires
which form the brim are shirred in
side the mull. So sometimes no mull
is used for the brim, but instead hand
some emnbroiderery which is stiffly
starched. The embroidery is plaited,
and falling in waves, makes a pretty
framework for the baby face.
A bow of ribbon or mull of the same
color as the hat, catches back the
brim in. the center of the front.-Chi
cago News.
BROILED MUSHROOMS.
A Seasonable Dish Which I. Sure to Tempt
the Epicare.
Fresh mushrooms are flooding the
market, and the epicure is tempting
his palate by ordering them prepared
in every conceivable style. The house
wife may follow the sage advice of
him who said "-the way to a man's
heart is through his stomach," and
gain a point by serving the man of the
house with a savory dish of broiled
mnushrooms. The recipe is here given.
Too much care can not be taken in se
lecting this vegetable, as the false ones
so nearly resemble the edible ones.
The most delicious mushrooms are
gathered in the broad fields, where
they have grown to perfection in the
open sunshine. Mushrooms should be
gathered soon after sunrise. Belect
some that have been spread open wide;
these are better for broiling thah the
"'button mushroom," which serve for
other ways of cooking.
Choose the largest mushrooms to be
had.. Peel and cut the stalks one-half
inch from the tops. BPaste well with
melted butter and sprinkle lightly with
pepper and salt. Heat the broiler very
hot. lay the mushrooms upon it with
the uppar side down; close itcarefully,
that the mushrooms may not be broken
and broil over a clear fire, turnink the
broiler first on one side and then on
the other. As soon as tender, w-hich
will be in about five minutes, open the
broiler, remove the mushrooms with
care and place on well-buttered slices
of thin toast which hlave been previ
ously prepared, or else on bread which
has been fried in butter. Pour over
the whole a sauce made of drawn but.
