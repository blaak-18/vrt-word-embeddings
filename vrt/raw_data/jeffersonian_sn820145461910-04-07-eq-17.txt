FARMERS’ UNION PAGE
THIS WILL INTEREST TEXAS AND
D. J. NEILL.
My Dear Friend:—Yours of 2 9th
ult. to hand, and while I have failed
to get the man (who bought Neill
and paid him SSO to leave the Pops
and help the Democrats) to make an
affidavit to the here well known and
undisputed fact, I can say that if
Neill is innocent he ought to sue me
and this whole community for slan
der. The man who paid Neill the
money did make an affidavit to the
fact to the Democratic Committee at
Deleon, Texas. His wife, being an
own cousin of Neill, was offended at
what he did and says he promised
her not to do so again; but if Neill
wants to test the matter in court, of
course he will tell it all on the wit
ness stand. Bro. Dornblaser, of Tex
as, was here a few days ago, and I
told him to satisfy himself about the
matter so he could tell his Texas
friends how it is, as I cannot answer
all the letters shot at me from over
there. He told me, land others, that
there was no doubt in his mind after
talking with citizens here.
I am going to try to get Dave’s
published withdrawal from the Pops
and advocacy of the Democrats.
Aside from this sell out, there is
nothing against Neill’s character so
far as I know. He was simply a
poor, hardup farmer, with a good
deal of brass and self-esteem.
Sincerely yours,
OLIVER S. JONES.

WILL DONATE $5 PER YEAR
TOWARDS F. U.
Dear Sir:—l see some of the com
rades have offered to give $3.00 a
year for the next three years to help
towards our work. I will agree to
give $5.00 a year the next three
years. But we can’t do anything in
Texas, now, until the Socialists run
their race. The Farmers’ Journal,
published at Abilene, teaches its
readers class hatred, and, above all,
to “down’ Tom Watson. It seems
that Tom Vatson is more in the way
than all the trusts and combines put
together. If the Socialists just get
Tom Watson out of the way, they
would have smooth sailing they
think. Well, I will ring off.

Hello, Brother John Lee! What
about that address you made before
that Atlanta convention? Didn’t
you tell them you congratulated the

peace for five years? Brother John,
that which is inside will come out in
spite of everything.
Don’t you know R. B. Gaston ac

time, privately, I believed there was
something of it. I want to ask:

everything, except for guano? I tell
you I believe there ought to be a
committee appointed to investigate
all of those books; if they are kept
as the secretary’s report states (in
the minutes of State meetings),
where he says two one thousand-dol
lar notes, and the money on hand,
makes $1,700, and a little over, I
don’t remember the exact amount,
you might find some other mistakes.
John, if you would have come out
long ago and told us when we asked
you questions, there never would
have been those letters written in
The Jeffersonian, because we could
get no information in the Union
News. Speak up, brethren, what are
your ideas on these points?

SOIL SURVEY.
I read with much interest your
comments, in a recent issue of The
Jeffersonian, on “Mr. I-Want-It-
Again”. The most vital thing noted,
of course, is the fact that Mr. “I-
Want-It-Again”, who so freely offer
ed seed, fish, soil surveys, etc., be
trayed his constituents; but you did
not take note of how worthless some
of his return gifts are to the aver
age farmer. It is a joke all over
this country that the free seed sent
out by Congressmen are often of
low vitality and they do not always
come true. For example, rutabaggas
may be labelled rape, and mustard
might turn out to be alfalfa, etc.
In regard to t-he soil survey, you
may ask any farmer who resides in a
county where the soil has been sur
veyed, if he has ever received any
direct benefit from the soil survey?
The farmer will probably say that
the soil map makes a good road
map, and that is about all the soil
map is worth to him.
Now, Mr. Watson, I believe you
are pretty well posted on everything,
but I don’t believe that you are
“next”, concerning the soil survey.
If you knew, you would go after the
soil mappers in the same fashion
that you went after the Foreign mis
sionaries.
Many public-spirited men are anx
ious to help the farming element,
and otherwise build up our agricul
tural interests. This is real patriot
ism, and we ought to thank God for
such men; but this does not prevent
them from making mistakes and en
couraging our Government to waste
large sums of money which do not
accomplish the desired ends. Many
good people have imagined that a
soil survey would be a panacea for
our agricultural ills. They have
thought that a soil survey whereby
all the different types of soils are
classified with specific instructions
for the management of each soil
type would be a sure cure for our
sick soils, but the medicine has not
worked. After years of soil sur
veying, and soil mapping, I can see
no tangible results to benefit the
farmer from the large sum of money
spent in making soil surveys. Can
you point to a single case where a
farmer has increased his yield per
acre by studying a soil map? One
farmer told me that he gets more
out of Greer’s Almanac than he
does from his soil map.
Some land companies and other
real estate agents use the soil map
to good advantage. The land com
pany’s agent takes a soil map of a
county in Alabama or Georgia to
Chicago or New York and induces a
crowd of poor Dutchmen to come
South to get rich by farming.
These poor fellows come in colo
nies, and attempt to farm our lands
without knowing local conditions.
The majority of them fail, sell out
to the company, and go back home
broke. The soil map ought to keep
them on the farm, but some how it
doesn’t. But we will leave the
question of the benefits to land com
panies, etc., and again ask the farm
r if the soil survey has helped his
fersontan
condition. As a rule, the farmer
has never heard of the soil survey
that has been made in his own
county, and if he has a soil map in
his pocket, he is utterly powerless to
use it for practical purposes. He is
hoping, however, that it will finally
do some good to future generations.
A soil survey sounds good, and
people in adjoining counties are
praying to have their county survey
ed by the soil mappers. When they
get the soil survey, and some maps,
they will look them over with the
same expression on their faces as
the fellow who bought a remedy to
kill boll weevils. The “expert” who
makes the survey is generally a
graduate of some Northern agricul
tural college, and knows about as
much about Southern conditions as
a hog knows about the “Sage Foun
dation”. The “expert” really makes
a good road map of the county, but
it is not much better for practical
purposes than a Rand McNally map
which you can purchase for ten
cents.
As to surveying the soil, the “ex
pert” simply looks across the woods
fields as he drives through the
county, and gives to the different
soils scientific names. For example,
when he locates a plot of red, stiff
clay land, such as you generally
have on the “old red hills” of Geor
gia, he stops, examines the subsoil,
VERY CAREFULLY, and decides
that it is “Cecil clay”, “Cecil sandy
loam”, “Cecil stony clay”, or “Cecil
stony loam”, according to the
amount of sand and stones mixed
with the clay, and also the per cent,
of humus and the depth of the sur
face soil.
Sandy land, with a yellow subsoil,
is usually described as Norfolk sand,
Norfolk sandy loam, Norfolk gravel
ly loam, Norfolk coarse sand, etc.
What we farmers know as “crawfish”
land, is designated by the “expert”
as Houston clay. Now, this is where
the great value of the soil survey
conies in. It enables the farmer to
drop those old country names, such
as “hammock land”, “creek bottom
land”, “crawfish land”, “buckshot
land”, etc., and if Cecil clay fails to
make more corn per acre than com
mon old red clay land, it is the farm
er’s own fault.
The “expert” gets all the infor
mation he needs along his route
from the farmers concerning soil
preparation, cultivation, adaptability
to crops, fertilizer formulas, etc.,
and then he goes back to his office
and writes up an attractive bulletin,
in addition to his beautifully color
ed soil map. The fact is, he does
not tell the farmer anything new in
the bulletin, which is sent FREE.
The farmer gives the “expert” all
the data for his bulletin, which is
given back to the farmer polished
up with technical terms, which is
“all Greek” to the farmer.
After the expert identifies a partic
ularly poor soil and gives it a high
sounding name, he can, with the
farmer’s aid, prescribe the proper
fertilizer, etc., but suppose the farm
er, next year, turns under a heavy
crop of cowpeas or velvet beans, or
applies twenty loads of stable ma
nure to his soil? If he practices this
method for two years, the soil is so
completely changed that the next
“expert” who comes along will give

mend a different fertilizer. So, you
see, there is no permanent value in
the instructions given by soil map
pers.
I will admit that the bulletin and
soil map sometimes are interesting
reading matter, and are temporarily
valuable for reference to loan com
panies, real estate agents, college
professors, professional men, and a
few progressive farmers; but to the
average “clod-hopper” the soil map
is not worth as much as an up-to
date almanac.
I am not a natural born pessi
mist, nor was I born in the objective
case; but I have figured that free
garden seed and soil surveys are not
worth the cost. . “FARMER.”
