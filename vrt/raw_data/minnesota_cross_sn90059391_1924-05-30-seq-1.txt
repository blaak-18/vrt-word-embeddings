TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
THE WORLD
OF SELFISHNESS
LESSONS THAT SHOULD
TEACH US
WHEN that gfrtat British
statesman Gladstone said*
"Selfishness is the greatest curse
•f the human race/’ he gave us
the benefit of his careful obser
vation. On every side we se«
selfishness blighting human hap
piness and ruthlessly destroying
friendships. There is so much
misery and suffering in the world
today as to make us wonder time
and time again what is wrong
with humanity. Yet the more
you ponder the more often you
come to the same final answer—
There is too much of Sata:\ic
selfishness and too little of
Christ-like unselfishness in the
world. The children of men need
a baptism of love like unto that
which was so beautifully dis
played by the Man from Naza
reth.
The words of Coleridge come to
me as I write: "Milton has care
fully marked in Satan the intense
selfishness, the alcohol of ego
tism, which would rather reign
in hell than serve in heaven." A
person who worships in the tem
ple of the Goddess of Selfishness
cannot truly understand the
meaning and sublimity of genu
ine service. Altruism, heroism,
self-denial, are the altars where
on we sacrifice self-love.
I agree with Henry Ward Bee
cher’s statement where it is em
phasized that no man is more
cheated than the selfish man.
Yet how few of us realize the re
actions of selfish actions? From
the beginning of the world until
this day, the selfish man digs a
grave for another and shortly
finds himself therein; then the
four winds of heaven fill the ex
cavation, leaving no mark to tell
a. Xxagic story .to
tions. "As frost to the bud," said
Tupper, "and blight to the blos
soms, even such is self-interest
to friendship; for confidence can
not dwell where selfishness is
porter at the gate." Blessed are
the unselfish, for they make* life
easier and man’s earthly sojourn
more pleasant.

somewhat Impatiently. A girl dressed
In a tucker-red calico garment rises

pretty little lass daintily dressed,
who, though at least live years young

perior mentality. “Michael, read the
first five stanzas,” said the teacher.
I listen to the reading of “The Song

•With flnsrera weary and worn.
With heavy and red.

eleven stancas of this “stuff,” which,
although called literature, Is not salt*

next—“the last six stanxas” —and
manages to put a little more into the

the reading of the poem Is completed,
the teacher dismisses the class In
“sixth rrade reading.” No comment
la made on the poem and no questions
pertaining to “the song of the shirt”
it asked. Vainly I strive for the aim
In the lesson. The “wherefor” of the
“whteh” Is beyond my comprehension.
“Fifth tirade Arithmetic,” the
teacher calls. A class of seven goes
forward. “Pass to the board,” the or
der comes. “Take this problem, chil

lem” from a textbook written In
189th “A wagon wheel Is 16 feet 8
Inches In circumference. How many

In giving such a “problem” to chll*

SOUTH CAROLINA
SENATOR WOULD
LET IN ALIENS
Dial Declares Italian Labor
ers Woul Save Situation
in the South
SCORED BY NEWSPAPER
bor, Trade Union Publication,
B*yg Workers Will Bee That
He Is Defeated
(■UNS Of
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 28-
Senator Dial, of South Carolina, cot
ton mill owner, violent “open shop
per,” and reactionary Democrat, is a
queer makeup in the senate. He
wanted the immigration harriers re
moved in order that an army of Ital
ian agricultural workers may be
brought to this countary. This is the
only way, so be says, that the south
ern agricultural situation may be
saved, because the southern negroes
are flocking to the north, attracted
by the comparatively high wages paid
in the industrial establishments of
that section.
The Minute man. published at
Charleston, calls attention to the fact
that Senator Dial’s reply to the let
ter sent him asking his support for
an educational bill was very disap
pointing. “Another letter was ad
dressed him and the pnswer to it was
of such a nature that we could only
conclude that Senator Dial was
aligned with the Romanists in their
desperate efforts to wreck our public
school system. And now he wants to
import more of the scum of Europe
in order to ‘save the southern agri
cultural situation.’ ”
Only One Per Cent Allen
In a previous issue of The Minute
Man we quoted at length from a Bal
timore trade paper as to the danger
of foreign born immigration. In that
article statistics were given aa to the
number of foreign-born in the vari
ous states of the union, and thanked
God that South Carolina had only one
per cent of foreign-born within her
borders, but now comes Senator Dial
with a proposal to throw down the
bars and increase our foreign-born
population, by the addition of per
haps thousands of ignorant Italian
laborers to “save the situation.”
'iJRfSWR-IRRrifeMi
of pure, unadulterated Anglo-Saxon
stock to “save the agricultural situ
ation,” or any other situation, for
that matter.
A labor paper called Labor, pub
lished in Washington, D. C., had this
to *ay of Senator Dial: “Like most
reactionaries, the senator lacks Vi
sion. American agriculture is in a
bad way, but it cannot be saved
through the importation of cheap la
bor. Italians would not be likely to
accapt conditions which are satis
factory to southern negroes. The
same economic urge which causes
the negroes to go north would induce
the Italians to follow in their foot
steps. If American agriculture is to
be saved, our statesmen must dis
play the wisdom and courage re-
Juired to bring about certain fun
ament al changes.
Farmer Must Own Land
‘We must do away with absentee
landlordism. The American farmer
must own the land he cultivates.
State and federal governments must
assist him in setting up a system of
co-operative buying and selling which
will enable hivn to escape the avarice
of the middle men.
“In order to do this it will not be
necessary to increase the price paid
by the ultimate consumer for the
products of the farm. We must nev
er overlook the fact that out of every
dollar paid by the consumer only 35
cents finds its wav to the pocket tf.
the farmer. In Denmark 90 cents
out of the consumer’s dollar goes to
the farmer. That tells the story, and
until that condition is changed and
the middle man is compelled to get
off the farmer’s back, agriculture
cannot be saved.
Senator Dial’s term expires in
1924. The farmers and industrial
workers of South Carolina may see to
it that he is returned to his cotton
mill to stay."
Another Protest
The Carolina Citizen, in speaking
of Senator Dial’s mistake, said: “Sen
ator Dial seems to have been bitten
by the immigration bug. Not long
ago He gave out an interview suggest
ing Italian world war veterans to
take the places of southern negroes
who have been migrating to the
north, and more lately he has been
advocating the bringing of Scandi
navians. He would do well to forget
the whole business. An immigration
movement will not be popular in
South Carolina.

“PUT AMERICANS ON GUARD”—GEORGE WASHINGTON
ST. PAUL MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, MAY 30, 1924
ciate News Letter)
Voters May Abolish Parochial
Schools in Michigan This Fall
Y\
(Editor’s Note— The following ar
ticle was. written by an lowa man
who Is In Constant teach with the on
ward march of Protestantism through
out the nation. The fallowing article
preoenta, la very clear and concise
form, the sltnatlon In Michigan.)
The supreme court of Michigan
has ordered the question of an amend
ment to the state constitution provid
ing for closing the parochial schools
of the state to be put upon the bal
lot for vote this fall.
In 1920 this question came up in
that state by petition. Few people
were awake to tbs situation and the
quaation. was defeated by a vote of
about two to one. It was instantly
given out another petition would
soon be circulated for a subsequent
vote on the question.
Friends of the parochial school at
once got busy. First a law was
passed providing for state inspection
of parochial, and there was scamper
ing of the robed sisters to the nor
mal schools of the state to make
themselves sufficiently proficient to
bring the grade of teaching in the
schools up to the public school stand
ard. The bill for inspection of the
schools had the earnest backing of
the governor, who, though not pro
fessing any religion, was reared a
Catholic. And it was openly claimed
that the bill was secretly-pushed by
two Catholic bishops, of course with
the thought of forestalling by such
measure any further effort to close
the parochial schools by amendment
to the constitution.
Then a bill was passed complicat
ing the method of getting signatures
upon the petition for amendment to
the constitution, the intent evident
ly being to kill further attempts to
get the necessary number of signers.
In spite of this greater difficuley.
petitions were again circulated, and
enough signatures were obtained to
put the question on the ballot. This
time the attorney general favored
Rome for some unaccountable rea
son, except, of course, always the se
cret power of the big politico-church
organization. He declared absolutely
with no authority of law that the sig
natures had not been obtained within
the proper time limit. The fact is
that no time limit was specified in
the law. But friends of the right do
MAYFIELD’S BROTHER
EXPENSIVE WITNESS

Cost More Money to Subpoena
Morris Mayfield Than He
Raised for Campaign
(Burma of Publication anS
Washington, d. c., May 23.- it
cost the government more money to
have Morris Mayfield, of Terrell, Tex
as, subpoenaed and brought to Wash
ington to testify in the Mayfield sen
atorial election contest case than he
solicited, raised and spent in money
in the Texas elections in which his
brother, Senator Mayfield, was elect
ed. That’s another bobble of the Ped
dy forces in this long-drawn-out con
test, which is fizzling more and more
every day it goes on.
Morris Mayfield is a wholesale gro
cer in Texas, and is interested in a
number of wholesle grocery con
cerns. He testified that he visited
all of them and that he raised among
the wholesale grocery men all-told
$l5O, and that he spent every cent of
it in the election of his brother to
the senate without telling the sena
tor anything about it. The witness
also told the subcommittee that in
his rounds he visited as many as 15
or 20 Klan organizations in Texas
and that to his certain knowledge not
one of them contributed a cent to the
Mayfield campaign as organizations.
The Peddy forces did not have any
more witnesses and the committee
was compelled to adjourn again, this
time until next Monday morning at
ten o’clock. The committee today
served notice on the Peddy attorneys
that it could not permit the case to
drag along much longer, that it de
sired to finish up all testimony now
in a very few days.
To Build Protestant
Hospital In Kansas
PITTSBURG, KAN.. May 26.—Con
struction of the first unit of a Prot
estant hospital, to be erected here by
the American Hospital association,
will begin soon, it was decided at a
massmeeting of the stockholders re
cently.
The site was purchased last sum
mer, and excavation work for the
basement and foundation will be
started as soon as the city completes
a storm sewer across the grounds.
The unit to be constructed will cost
approximately SIOO,OOO exclusive of
equipment, and will accommodate be
tween 60 and 75 patients. It will be
fireproof, and will be built to con
form with the latest ideas in hospi
tal construction. Ultimately, the ad
ditional units will make the hoepitel
one of the largest and best in this
section.
TWO UNITS JOIN FOM fiN
ITASCA. TEX - Hillsboro Klan No.
89, and Itasca Klan, No. 196, are con
solidating and in tnie way expect to
accomplish more work than either
Klan could accomplish individually.
A Joint moating wae held recently at
Hillsboro and It la estimated that
nearly IJMO attended
not always lie down when the tug of
war comes, and Michigan had some
determined men fighting to rid the
state of this most un-American in
stitution, the parochial school, and
they took the case to tie supreme
court, with the result that the court
puts the question on the ballot for
vote this fall.
Michigan was the first state to take
the matter up, and the campaign
there this fall will he watched by
good citizens all over the country.
No question all the power of Rome
will center In the state against the
amendment. But, oqtside of certain
sections of the upper peninsula, Mich
igon is one of the most completely
Protestant and American states in
the union, and there is very little
doubt that the question will carry
this fall.
The campaign has a much better
chance there this fall than it Wad
some years ago, for the reason that
the Klan is ndw well on its feet in
Michigan and growing by leaps and
bounds. The hooded Knights will
give a good report of themselves, this
fall.
Then for three years the campaign
has been on in Michigan for a state
law providing for the daily use of
the Bible in every public school in
the state, and very late in the legis
lative session of 1923 a bill was in
troduced in the senate looking to
ward that result, introduced simply
to get people to thinking about it for
the next two years.
Michigan people are learning three
very important things that lie at
the very heart of American welfare
and national stability:
1. The public school is the hope of
the republic.
2. That being so, every child of
the republic must be in the public
school.
3. The two preceding things be
ing so, the public school must have
in its curriculum absolutely every
thing the child needs to make him a
safe, intelligent, clean, worthy, Amer
ican citizen, not only mental and
physical and industrial training, but
also that moral training which can
come only from the Bible in daily
use in every school room.
The eyes of the nation will settle
on Michigan and the fight there for
Americanism.
To Curb Crime Means
Reduction of Taxes
•oey May Then Be Ipaed Bar-
Education and County Im
provements
(By a Centerville Klansman)
I WANT to call the attention of
the taxpayers of Centerville to
the number of criminal cases which
have come before our county courts.
You ask where your tax money goes?
Too much of it goes for criminal
upkeep.
The largest per cent of cases be
fore our judicial bodies are those of
foreigners. It has been found that
the majority of foreigners brought
before the courts are without natur
alization papers or any intention of
procuring them. About 75 per cent
of such cases go unpunished, or with
a light jail sentence. American ju
rors have a false sense of pity for the
foreigners “who are having a hard
struggle in a strange land.”
But it is time Americanism was
protected. Citizens of Centerville
should awake to the situation. They
should know that there are a number
of roadhouses between the Rock Is
land crossing and Mining Camp
Number Thirty. As an evidence of
this, taxicabs may be seen at these
different places all hours of the
night. These places are no more than
dives where men and women may
congregate and where all known vice
exists. Women of the underworld
type make their business at such
places, and the condition on the
whole is most deplorable.
These joints are run by foreigners,
but. American citizens help to pat
ronize them. The general public
would shudder with horror to know
that some /at the business men of our
city patronize these places. The
courts of today should be given suf
ficient backing by some organized
body to be able to satisfactorily
crush both patrons and owners of
these road houses. In the past, the
fear of the Black Hand society cowed
some of the jurors to leniency, but
that day is past, and there is an or
ganization strong enough to crush
this illicit trade.
That organization is the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan. The men of
that organization are red-blooded
Americans with enough courage to
face the dirty political ring which
constantly supported and elected of
ficers who favored this lawless ele
ment. and demand a clean, law-abid
ing city. As soon as this condition
is brought around our taxes will be
used for education and improvement,
rather than in our courta and for
the maintenance of a large force of
enforcement officers.
Keducing the number of criminal
cases means ultlmataly the reducing
of our taxes. That gives the situa
tion a financial and moral aspect, and
every real man should shoulder the
burden of cleaning up Appanoose
county eo that rapresentativee of the
underworld will have no place here.

Sir: —
We note in this morning's edi
tion of your paper an item regard
ing he burning of a fiery croaa at
or near a House of the Good Shep
herd, in this city.
Inasmuch aa the fiery cross is
distinctively an emblem of the Ku
Klux Klan, this item will natu
rally lead the public of St. Paul to
believe that the Klan burned that
cross last night.
Wish to advise that the burning
of such cross last night positively
was not authorized and, if any of
the parties responsible fur burn
ing same are members of this or
ganization, they were acting whol
ly without authority and purely
on their own initiative.
It is our belief that this act was
perpetrated by enemies of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, for
the purpose of discrediting our or
ganization in the minds of the
public.
Wish to advise that the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan is not an an
ti-Catholic organization, except in
the minds of the less informed and
the uninformed, and is probably
so construed by them because of
our belief in the separation of
church and state, which, as you
know, is written in the constitu
tion of the United States, and in
our allegiance to Protestantism.
If our stand on these two princi
ples makes us anti-Catholic, then
we plead guilty.
We understand that your paper
has not been in sympathy witn our
organization, but we believe that
a sense of justice and fair play
will prompt you to publish this
letter, as a direct and authentic
reply to the deed perpetrated last
night. Would kindly ask that you
do not publish this letter, unless
you publish it in its entirety.
Very truly yours,

Proof of God's Love
WILLIAM J. BRYAN
We see all about us conclusive
proof of the infinite intelligence and
fathomless love of the heavenly Fa
ther. On the lofty mountain sum
mits He builds. His mighty reservoirs,
and piles high the winter snows,
which, melting, furnish the water for
singing brooks, for the hidden veins,
and for the springs that pour out
their refreshing flood through the
smitten rocks. At His touch the same
element that furnishes ice to cool the
fevered brow furnishes also the steam
to move man’s commerce on sea and
land. He imprisons in roaring cata
racts exhaustless energy for the serv
ice of man; He stores away in the
bowels of the earth beds of coal and
rivers of oil; He studs the canyon’s
frowning walls with precious metals
and priceless gems; He extends His
magic wand, and the soil becomes
rich with fertility; the early and lat
ter rains supply the needed moisture,
and the sun, with its marvelous al
chemy, transmutes base clay into
golden grain. He gives us in infinite
variety the fruits of the orchard, the
vegetables of the garden, and the ber
ries of the woods. He gives us the
sturdy oak, the fruitful nut tree, and
the graceful palm.
In compassion He makes the horse
to bear our burdens and the cow to
supply the dairy; and He gives us the
faithful hen. He maeks the fishes to
scour the sea for food, and then yield
themselves up to the table; He sends
the bee forth to gather sweets for
man, and birds to sing his cares away.
He paints the skies with the gray of
the morning and the glow of tne sun
set; He sets His radiant bow in the
clouds, and copies its colors in myri
ad flowers. He gives to the babe a
mother’s love, to the child a father’s
care, to parents the joy of children,
to brothers and sisters the sweet as
sociation of the fireside, and He gives
to ail the friend. Well may the
psalmist exclaim. “The heavens de
clare the glory of God; and the firma
ment showeth His handiwork. Day
unto day uttereth speech, and night
unto night showeth knowledge.’’
Surely everything that hath breath
should praise the Ix>rd.~**ln His Im
age.”

HUGE MEETING

Surrounded by White
Robed Figures
CURIOUS TURNED AWAY
Secretary of Compaay Says Re
Believes Meeting Was Jast
“Wiener least”
FAIRMONT, MINN., May 12.-K*
Klux Klan member? of Mm Lin coqb
ty had a big gathering at Interlaken
Inn last night.
In the glare of a flaming red cross
constructed of electric lights which
were supplied with “juice” from a
Deico-light plant, were many white
robed figures, and others in civilian
dreaa.
The meeting is thought te have been
the aftermath of a call sent out Sat
urday night through the burning of
a score of crosses in Fairmont and
others in the various villages and
towns of the county.
Autolsts Tamed Back
Fairmont autoists, out for a ride
about 10 o'clock last night, attempt
ed to drive through Interlaken past
the hotel and around the race track,
but their car was stopped by four
men in white robes, carrying flash
lights, and the driver was asked to
leave.
“Get along there,” said the senti
nels, who ran toward the car from the
hotel porch. In the meantime the
lights on the cross were extinguished
The machine was not allowed to
drive up to the hotel, but. was turned
south at one side of it and left the
park. The purpose of the meeting
is not known, but it is believed to
have been a Klan rally and possibly
a naturalization ceremony. It looked
as if from 100 to 160 automobile*
were parked around the hotel.
Was Wiener Roast!
J. A. Mayer, secretary of the Inter
laken company, said today he did not
know anything about a Klan meeting
at the park. Mr. Mayer lives in the
Interlaken farmhouse some distance
from the inn.
“About two weeks ago,” he said, "a
party came to me and asked if Fair
mont business men could have a wie
ner xpast in the park. I told thim to
gtf Aeiur TTr?y iira hot dwrtNi-tmi -
as I carried the key. That'* vail T
know about it. I guess it waa just a
wiener roast.”
The Klan apparently is growing to
