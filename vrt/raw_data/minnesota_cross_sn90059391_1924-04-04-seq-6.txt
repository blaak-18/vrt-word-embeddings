(Boreaa ef Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 31.—J. Frank Norfleet, a Texas
Ranger who hails from Hale Center, Texas, arrived in Washington
a few days ago to attempt to get help from the government through
his representative in congress, because of his most valuable work
during the last four years in running down, capturing and convict
ing 69 arch swindlers and putting them where they belong, after
an absolute failure on the part of William J. Burns, head of the bu
reau of intelligence, department of justice.
Mr. Norfleet, who is a Knight Templar and a Shriner, recites a
story that beats all the detective stories in existence for thrills and
adventure. He has really rendered a public service to the govern
ment and its people in pursuing and convicting a terrible gang of
swindlers and gun men. It has taken him four years to do the job,
and in that time he has spent $17,000 of his own money. He asks
nothing for his work.
This Texas man saw his dreams
come true about two weeks ago,
when his last man, W. B. Spencer, a
Knight of Columbus, was sentenced
to serve eight years in the Hunts
ville penitentiary. On that day Mr.
Norfleet fulfilled a vow he took four
years ago, just after he had been
swindled out of 145,000 on a bunco
•tock deal. He swore he would track
•very one of the band down, if it
took him the rest of his life, and the
chase carried him to the four corners
of the world.
Barns Failed
Mr. Norfleet started out armed with
warrants for the arrest of his men
and a deputy sehrifTs commission
given him by the sheriff of Hale
county, Texas, on what proved to be
the greatest man hunt in the history
of this country. He came direct to

Washington snd called on William J.
Burns for help, who told him that
all the crooks that had defrauded
him were wanted by the department
of justice, and that federal agents
would have them all under arrest in
three weeks. He also told Mr. Nor
fleet that it was useless for him to
continue the man-hunt, because the
federal government had prior claims
on each man. The “three weeks” be
came four years, and the record
shows that the department of justice
did not apprehend a single one of
the criminals nor help Norfleet, who
caught every one of the 69, and land
ed them behind the bars. Just think
for a moment of the comparison: one
lone Texan arrested and convicted 69
men, while the powerful department
of justice with its 1600 agents scat
tered all over the country and the
world did not arrest one of the
gang.
Imposters on Masonry
The confidence men first reached
Norfleet by using alleged Masonry to
win his confidence. Joe Furey, the
master mind, used stolen Masonic
credentials and by giving certain
signs and passwords that ne had got
ten from a New York Mason who be
trayed his fraternity, won the con
fidence and hospitality of the Tex
an.
Mr. Norfleet’s case only emphasises
the fact that Masons, the world ov
er, should exercise the greatest care
in the selection and election of men
to receive Masonic degrees and hon
ors. Norfleet it a Mason that the
fraternity can well be proud of, as he
tried to live and practice the ideals
and principles of the great order.
The men who skinned him boasted on
the witness stand that they were not
Masons and told of their Catholic
ism.
Norfleet trailed Joe Furey to Los
Angeles, where deputy sheriffs dou
ble-crossed the Texan and permitted
Furey to escape, after Furey*s wife
had given them $20,000 as a bribe.
Norfleet then trailed Furey to Flori
da, arrested him at Jacksonville, se
cured a written confession from him
in which he told of his escape from
Los Angeles after bringing the offi
cers. Furey got 20 years in the
Huntsville pen and died in prison.
Returning to Los Angeles, Norfleet
arrested the two deputies, scured
their conviction, ssw them get a 14-
year sentence and the sheriff was re
moved from office by the governor.
Walter Lipp and W. J. Anderson, the
deputies, had been trusted public of
ficials for 15 years. Anderson waa a
gun-man who had killed five men and
one woman in his time. He tried to
shoot Norfleet the day before the
trial but the Texan got the drop on
him.
Before arresting Furey, Norfleet
trailed him to a hotel in San Ber

Baptist Church
PITTSBURGH, KAN., March 31.
The singing of “Onward Christian
Soldiers” by four men and three wo
men, natives of France and members
of the congregation, who forsook Ro
manism and embraced a religion that
does not conflict with the spirit of
Americanism and the country they
have learned to love, was one of the
impressive numbers at a recent eve
ning service of the Arma Baptist
church. Several robed Klansmen of
Pittsburgh were present:
After the sermon had been deliver
ed, the Knights advanced to the al
tar, where they knelt, while the lead
er offered a prayer. A young woman
gave a recitation praising the Klan.
The Klansmen tnen made a sub
stantial donation to assist the church
in retiring a mortgage.
through a window. Furey then went
to Los Angeles where he “fixed” the
officers.
In the San Bernardino capture, he
arrested Charles Gerber and E. J.
Ward, both of whom proved to be
Catholics and life members of the
fraternity that few Protestant Gen
tiles are affiliated with, one that
caters to both Catholics and Jews.
Ward was brought to Washington, D.
C., to face a federal charge and later
committed suicide in a jail here. Ger
ber’s career cost the lives of six
men.
Norfleet Cornered
Just before the trial of Spencer in
Fort Worth, Norfleet was lured to
the basement of the chamber of
commerce by John Conley and
two other men. Conley is a K. C. de
tective. A warrant had been issued
for him because he had been accused
in confessions of some of the ring
leaders of the bunco men of having
collected $4,500, 10 per cent of the
total loot, for extending them pro
tection. Conley cornered Norfleet in
the basement and said: “Give me
those documents or you won’t get out
of here alive.” Mr. Norfleet got the
drop on him and did not surrender
his evidence. Just before the trial,
Spencer said:
“I am not a Mason, but I am a
Knight of Columbus, which is a half
brother, just as close as they can be
without being the same.
Mr. Norfleet had captured Spencer
in the wilds of Canada, after a dog
sled chase across the Dominion
through blizzards. After the cap
ture, while returning to a Canadian
city to place him in jail, the Texan
met some Canadian police. Norfleet
says that Spencer crossed his fore
head and his breast, and called upon
the officers to help him. The offi
cers set on Norfleet and beat him up,
nowithstanding the fact hat he had
a warrant for Spncer and the lat
ter was a prisoner.
“After they beat me up they re
leased Spencer and brougnt me to
jail. When I saw the high Canadian
officers, I showed them my warrants.
The police then began making crosses
and begging for mercy on their
knees. They were released and kept
on the force.
Mounted Police Helped
“Then I appealed to heads of the
Royal Mounted Police, and they made
it so hot for Spencer that he left
and went to Salt Lake City, bought
a home there and had been there one
week when I arrested him. That oc
curred on October 1, last year,” said
Norfleet.
While searching for Spencer in
Denver, Mr. Norfleet ran into a gang
of 34 confidence men, of which Spen
cer was a leader. With the aia of
the district attorney and state rang
ers, he captured the 34 men. That
gang was jailed August 24, 1922. At
the trial it waa proven that this
gang had fleeced a Houston dentist
of $20,000 on a fake race, a “wire
tapping” scheme. Eevery man drew
a penitentiary sentence.
Lou I* Blounder, leader of the
Denver gang, admitted that he was
a Catholic and proud ef it. Others
in the gang did likewise.
Later, Mr. Norfleet captured a band
of 11 swindlers at Lauderdale, Flori
da, and they were all convicted and
given prison sentences.
Mr. Norfleet also captured Reno
Hamlin, a Catholic, twice. Caught
him the first time in Georgia, where
he obtained freedom on $5,000 bail,
jumped his bail and Norfleet recap
tured him in 1921 in Oklahoma. He
is now serving a penitentiary sen
tence in Georgia.
This Texas ranger, Mr. Norfleet,
has spent the last four years round
ing up such characters, and he has
captured every man he started af
ter, a feat that William J. Burns and
his 1500 agents did not do. In fact,
they didn’t get one of them. Mr. Nor
fleet doesn’t want congress to pay
him a salary for what he has accom
plished; he is simply asking Uncle
Sam to repay him tne expense money
he is out of pocket.. Burns and the
government detective agency should
have performed this work but failed;
therefore, all right thinking men will
approve of Uncle Sam repaying Nor
fleet the money he has actually spent
in this work.

KLAN ARGUMENT
North Platte, Neb., Farmer-
Labor Herald Denounces
Organization
KLANSMAN REPLIES
Baseless Charges Refuted in a
Which Gives American
Viewpoint
When Klansmen of North Platte,
Nebraska, recently visited a church
and carried on some other American
activities, it did not suit Joseph Gil
bert, editor-manager of The Farmer-
Labor Herald, of that city, described
as “a weekly newspaper supporting
progressive political action.” .
Mr. Gilbert is an Englishman, and
evidently the ways of Americans are
not to his liking. He denounced the
Klan. However, he was fair enough
to print an answer to his story which
is more than most commercial papers
will do.
• The answer written by the Klan
member follows:
The Ku Klux Klan of North Platte
extends greeting to the people of this
community, and begs leave to answer
the article that appeared in this pa
per on March 7, 1924.
We wish to emphatically state that
we are not ashamed of our affiliation
with the Ku Klux Klan. The men
who are behind the mask are the
men who are engaged in a legitimate
occupation, and who mingle, daily, in
the social life of this community.
They are not jail-birds and thugs,
but are the men who have a reputa
tion as decent, honest-to-God Ameri
can citizens. And they all have the
heritage of the American birthright,
having been born under the waving
folds of Old Glory, and are willing to
lav down their lives that the Flag of
all flags may never go down in the
dust of defeat.
The mask does not change the heart
that beats beneath it. And that heart
beats one hundred per cent for the
advancement of America and the pro
tectioa of her ideals and institutions.
It is also a heart that beats one
hundred per cent strong against the
despoilers of homes, the violators of
law, the foes of this gp'eat republic
and the corrupt political machines
that dominate so many communities.
In hundreds of communities the Ku
Klux Klan has accomplished great and
mighty reforms. It has brought these
reforms to pass, always, through aid
ing the officers of the law in the
proper performance of their legal du
ties. It has been effective through
secrecy. God has seen fit to bless their
efforts, and has aided their work, in
the same way that He blessed the
use of secrecy in days gone by. It
was a secret work when He placed Jo
seph in Egypt. It was a secret work
again when He placed Moses on a
lonely hillside as a sheep herder. Id
secrecy again He raised up a king
from the shepherd boy, David, and
even Samuel, the prophet and priest,
anointed him in secret.
In secrecy again He hid the Christ-

child in Egypt. There is also an
eighteen-year jperiod of secrecy in the
life of Jesus Christ, from the age of
twelve to thirty. The early church
held their meetings in secret. In se
crecy they grew and prosperred. And
they began to fail only when they be
came the state church of Rome. With
their splendor and their magnificent
equipment, they failed, and the world
plunged into the abyss and darekness
of the middle ages. And when Chris
tianity began to emerge from the
darkness, God employed secrecy, and
through secrecy Protestantism grew
and prospered. And now, after a few
centuries, God is using a secret meth
od to bring to pass His will, and aid
America, that she might be Chris
tian, not only in name, but also in
fact.
History repeats itself, and the se
crecy of the Klan is but another page
in the panels of human existence.
As to the Ku Klux Klan not being
interested in church services “save as
they themselvf), are the main fea
ture.” They a/e the men who are
the regular attendants at the serv
ices of the Protestant churches.
Of all the organizations in Ameri
ca today, the Ku Klux Klan is one of
the few that limits its membership
to men who believe in the tenets of
the Christian religion and accept the
Deity of Jesus Christ as a common
meeting ground. It raises no bar
riers. Men who do not accept these
common teachings of Jesus Christ,
bar themselves. It does not insist
that all men must believe as it does,
but it does insist on its right to make
its platform such that men who be
long meet on the common ground of
faith in Jesus Chrit as the King of
King and Lord of Losrds. The infi
del, sceptic, agnostic and higher crit
ic has no part in this movement. It
is a movement of men, thank God,
that believes in the faith of the Fa
thers, and the Bible of our Mothers.
As to the action of the Ku Klux
Klan making an offering to a Protest
ant church being an “impertinence.”
It is rather a peculiar charge to bring
against men for making contributions
to the cause of the Master. So many
times the people who bring such
charges are the folks who sing the
loudest that grand old hymn, “Jesus
Paid it All,” and fail to recognize the
fact that they themselves have some
thing to pay. Is it a crime, in North
Platte, to aid in a financial way, a
church? Is it a crime to help a
church meet the needs of the com
munity to which she ministers?
As to classing the Ku Klux Klan
with “hold-up men and burglars.” It

and loyal member of the Allen ad

livered a vicious attack on the Klan,
after having acepted an invitation
to attend a lecture, and in a recent
campaign suppored a Roman Catha

Mr. Allen, it is conceded, soft
pedaled on the Klan issue, and only
alluded to his Industrial court law
which has since received its death

HUGE KUN KLONKIAVE

Wilkinsburg Is Scene of Beauti*

WILKINSBURG, PA., March 31.
The green and shelelah of St. Pat
rick’s Day gave way here Monday to
the red, white and blue and the sym
bolic fiery cross of the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, when more than
5,000 visiting members of the organi
zation, both men and women, repre
senting scores of Klans and commun
ities from western Pennsylvania,
crowded Wilkinsburg to a degree it
has never witnessed before, and
staged the most colorful demonstra
tion ever held in Pennsylvania dur
ing the current year.
It was Klan day rightly in Wilkins
burg, and no force, either the unit or
aggregate, attempted to dispute the
right of the hordes of visiting Ameri
cans to meet with their fellow mem
bers. ,
Headed by the King Kleagle of the
state and two of his personal repre
sentatives, the long and colorful pro
cession started through the packed
throngs of spectators from Wilkins
burg and all surrounding communi
ties. A large American flag was car
ried at the head of each individual
delegation, flanked by a guard com
posed of picked men. Cheers and ap
plause greeted the Americans as they
marched along, the simple courtesy
marking a vivid contrast with treat
ment accorded similar processions in
other communities.
A class of nearly 300 candidates
had been initiated into the mysteries
of the order while the parade was
held.
