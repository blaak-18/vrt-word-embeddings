Independent Vot
[From the Mobile Regist
A great deal of stress has laid
of late on the balance of p that
resides in the hands of the epen
dent voter."' By "indepe t vo
ters" are meant those who g to
no party. Not counting large
number of voters of the cl. o be
long to no party because th not
take sufficient interest in ie af
fairs to join its ranks, study prin
ciples, and labor for its st a, we
r point to the distinguished rman
American, Carl Schurz, as high
est sample of an "independ oter."
But this is not the normal tion of
Mr. Schurz, for he was a ber of
the Radical or Republican t, and
served it from the beginni of the
war in its councils in peao \''
W, rd o ty, ip agid, do
struction was fully shape and jut
into practice. Mr. Schu was Qt
that time, then, what in Delm4
nico speech he terms "a co man.:
Then we have the testim of Mr.
Schurz's example that a may be
a patriot and a statesman d still be
a "party" or "place" ma In other
words, that all the courag nd wi
dom in public affairs are confined
to the class of "independ t voters."
We have never been able respond
in our admiration to the 'gh claim
of honor to the man wh oast that
he "belongs to no part People
who. sail under no flag b heir own
on the high seas, are gen ily watch
ed by the powers that ca their own
world known colors, as picious of
piratical intentions, and nding ii
heed of passports. In itical war
fare armies are kept i the field
they are called parties, they are
organized bodies, who t together,
and who, to act effectiv , must be
disciplined bodies. No this is all
that there is in "a party" eat so ex
cites the show. of conte t in some
people. Parties are an ringly spo
ken of as "held together y the cohe
sive power of public plu er" Why
not say "by the cohesi power of
public principlet Suppes there had
been no Democratic party in exist
ence the last ten years! lmat would
have been the political c dition of
the country to-day t Gra and cor
ruption masters at Washington, the
military spread all over thq Southern
States,.New York, Ohio, atl Indiana,
still under the dominion of the Mor
tons, Chandlers, and Williamses, a
"third term" followed by a buzzard
in the eagle's nest of imperialism.
And all this, not because multitudes
of citizens-"independent voters," if
you please--would not have been
rrifled. at the ruin of
an organized force to rl-, without
defeat of the Grant tyranny iiad iiot
been possible. Well, then, was it an
honor to brag of, to have been a neu
tral and a do-nothing through all
those days and years of toil and dan
ger, or, to have been a. faithful and
patient worker in the ranks of the
Democratic party to- build up the de
fensive power, to throw between the
liberties of the country and its fierde
assailantat. Any man can sit on tihe
fence witlhout being much of a hero.
But it requires no common grit to
stand by a party of principles through
good and through evil report, and to
hold its standard high'. while the
whole world is burying .it supposed
remains and rlngiog dirges over its
unsilled grave.
The Democratic party of the United
States is entitled to the credit of the
event of the last and present years
that have illed the breast. of "Inde
pendents" as well as of Democrats
with the joy of I great deliverance in
the past and of bright hopes' to come.
To be sure, it was enabled to win s0
great a victory by the aid of the
"foating vote" in the country, which
gravitates from side to saide accord
ing to the greatness of the issue or
the intensity of peculiar excitminents.
But suppose there had been no Demo.
cratic party to gravitate, ot what
practical value in the tremendous
contest would these fosters have
been ? Merely to be swept away by
a' slnogle dash of Grant's itrained par
ty leaders. And this is the situation
of Mr C'arl Sbhurs and the "indepen
dent votets,"of hiselass.' It doesnot
follow, beeause. Mr. Sthors belongs
to neither of the great parties is array
for the great battle that is to decide
the destinies Of Our 0overnment, that
their 'rmies are not afield, sad that
the great war is not tofbe waged.
Statesman, patriot, orator, great as
hels in every public trait of lhis char
peter, hie at last carries only 'tlhe
weight ofa fly on' the wheels of the
great wanchariotes that are to. decide
this contest. In the issues between
them lhe cannot be geutral when the
sgnal is girven, fthas admitted itb
by the reasots hie gave for seceding
from the Radital party.~' In heart
and principle he is bound to the De
mocratio- side in spite of all his pre
possessions, his prejudices,, and his
theories of "independent" politics.
The Demoreaey will get all these
votes in 1870, unless it stultifiees it
self beyond all show or reason, and
retraces the splendid steps it hais
taken toward constitutional redempl
tion and restoration.

EXPERIMENT WITH MERCURY IN
MONTANA--A DISTINGiISED PROFESSOR.
According to the New 1'orthwest,
there has b n some remarkably cold
weather in ilver Bow, Montana. A
corresponde t of that paper furnish
es the folio ing interesting item of
news: "
Your favo of the 10th is at hand,
and inquiri a answered herewith.
On the eveni g of January 8th, seve
ral persons ing in my store, and
the spirit ermoneter registering
S"35 deg. low," the remark was
r made that q icksilver would congeal
at three do ees lower. I requested
my clerk, P. r, Stolte, to thoroughly
cleanse a b r tumbler an'd partially
S},1' with icksilver.. We then ex
t spirit aen l ncsirdt the
fire-proof o the north side of the
store, givin them as Dearly equal
exposure as ossible. An hour after
r. the thermo eter marked 38 deg. be
e low, but th quicksilver still remain
e ed unchang d. At 9:20 p. in. the
I thermomete stood 40 dog. below;
- still the qui ksilver was live, but ter
I ribly cold. t 9:40 p. m. the spirit
indicated 41 deg. below; the quick
d silver was I ardeuing on the outside.
A few minutes later the thermometer
t stood 42 de below. I picked up the
tumbler of q ickailver, and to my as
n tonishment tand it completely solid
_ ified-as ha d as a' rock. I carried
it into the tore, and several per
sons exami d it, it remaining in
that conditi n some time before it
showed life.
On Janna y 10, at 11 p. m., the
thermomete stood 35 deg. below;
January 11, t 7 a. mn., 44 deg. below;
SJanuary 11, p. m., 36 below. On
1 the evening f January 8, the evening
above menti ned, at 10:30 p. m., the
register was 6 dog. below. This is
the coldest esther we have had.
Under date of January 14, the cor
respondent a ds the following news,
f expressed in he peculiar style of the
1 West: "Jack Frost held the best hand
last night, an played it as follows:
At 9:45 p. . the thermometer stood
f 50 deg. below; at 10:30 p. m., 54 deg.
below; at 11: p. m. 56 deg. below."
The weath r locals of the North
west make ui an interesting collee
tion. The fol owing are a few speci
men bricks:
As the stag came through Blachk
I foot on Tne ay evening, nobody
could tell he cold it was; all the
Sthermometers were frozen. Thi In
f dependent, of Thursday, contains an
account of t freezing to death of
f four Chiname , going down the gulch
t below town. A couple of gentlemen
next fall, to r main through the win
ter, a registe ed spirit thermometer,
graduated do n about two feet be
low zero. Th interest of the record
would be inceased if they could at
tach to it a lf-registering almanac.
The most imugsted man in Deer
Lodge this wipter is (ranville Stuart,
Esq., the most careful thermometrical
observer in Montana. Anticipating a
possible spelt of weather that the
mercurial thermometers would be in
adequate to record, he sent to New
York for a fine spirit thermometer,
for which hej was charged a spirited
price. It: arrived in good season, but
on exaniinin~ It it was found to be
only gradna d to thirty degrees be
low sero. He says it is a good enough
summer the mometer, but it isn't
"calculated" or this klind of a winter.
Could't Small Print.
A corres rdent at Constantine,
Mich., cont butes the following to
thle "Editor' Drawer" of Harper for
June :
I was lig a melancholy sketch
of the last dy of 'poor Tom Mar
shall a fewday ao-how his light
went out, flashing and flickering,
amidst the aunts of men who dared
make sport of him, as the Philistines
did of Go ath, and I remember a
story told of him by a gentleman
who was resent on the occasion,1
which I no er saw in print.
"Many y ars ao," he said, "when
the sciene of prenology firet began
to attracs ubli attention, a lecture
of that so ;, brimful of enthusiasm,
turned up in Lonisville, and gave a
series of ' akm' to the people, and
examined ldrge numbeit of heads,
made char teo much each, and, in
short, dev loped quite an amount of
hidden vi and virtue which had not
been befor even suspected among the
good peop of that city. Tom Mar
shall was present and enjoyed the
'exeroises.' After tihe affltair was
over a cre d adjourned to the Gait
House to pt books and render jadg
Smeat ont e science itself.
"Tom id he could examine heads
as well as nybody-- t was a humbog,
a penny- thing business-and to
satisfy th people he was right, he
would takl any number of men who
chose to into the parlor adjoininog
j and make the esperiment, although
he tsa l ttle the worse for an over
Sdose of Be rbon. Many went in, and
Tom seat them, and . went round
from man man, most of whom he
knew, an made a vast amount of
Sfun for t1 crowd, as be always could
on almost any provocatblon.

Do you feel 'em Crawl ? I
IIe was from Nebraska. lie had
eaten nothing but grasshoppers since
the 4th of July, 1871, and his Atom
ach was in an awful condition-it was I
full of grasshoppers I lie could feel I
them jumping about and trying to I
kick their way out, but their toe-nails 4
scratched his alimentary canal, and a
spasmodic movemelt of the muscles
of this thorax, forced them back into I
the cavity bef'ore they reached the I
root of his tongue. lie had left a 4
wife and nine famished children at I
home, and come to St. Louis to col
lect funds to save his neighbors from I
starvation. lie had not been success- i
ful-perhaps because his "creden
tials" were not strong enough. And
now, if that barkeeper would accoim
modate him with a spoonful of whis
ky-it was the only thing that would
keep the grasshoppers quiet in his I
c 4'e "ý..t kinder stnperfied them,
seuveral .Zu ._ -,xmall for I
several hours, but as soon as they
became sobered up, they became live
ly as crickets, and played leapfrog in
the pit of his stomach. He killed a
agood many of them with whisky, but
their eggs were all the time hatching,
and lie belied there were at least 10,- i
000 live ones occuping the space de- I
signed by nature for the laboratory of I
bread and meat and such other things.
He had no money, and if the barkeep
er would trust him for a few drops of I
crow foot, he would remunerate 1
him out of the first collection for the
sufferers. By adding a little pepper- I
mint and a few grains of sugar to the I
liquor, the medicine would be made
more potent; or if there was no pep- 1
permint convenient, a drop of ginger I
would do as well. I
The barkeeper deeply sympathized
with the grasshopper-stricken people I
of Nebraska. He pitied. any man
who had grasshoppers in his stomach. I
If whisky and peppermint and ginger a
or anything else his barrom afforded,
would relieve him, he was welcome 1
to partake. He could not accept I
thanks for so small a favor: was only I
sorry he didn't have whisky and
peppermint enough to destroy all the i
grasshoppers in Nebraska.
The barkeeper poured two table
spoonfuls of the essence of Jamaica
ginger into a tumbler, added an equal
quantity of pepper-sauce, shook in a
thimbleful of cayenne pepper, empti
ed a small vial of sulphurie acid on
top, and then sprinkled a few drops
of tanglefoot over the mixture, and
handing the tumbler to the Nebras
kian, told him to "swallow it quick."
The grasshopper-plagued stranger
waited for no second invitation, but
poured the decoction down his throat
at one swallow.
"Hodo .It.y lilkt_.jt asked the
b"1t¶tbnopperedl rtillvRIual malue
no reply. His eyes rolled in their I
sockets, and the tears ran out of them
in streams. His mouth was open
wide enough to swallow the barkeep
er and all his decanters. He placed
both hands over his stomach and cast
an imploring glance toward the water
pitcher.' " >
"Do you feel 'em crawl 1" said the
barkeeper in the anxious tone of a
sick nurse.
The stranger made no reply, but
continued to press his stomach, and
watered the floor with his tears:
"Take some of this horseradish," I
said the barkeeper;."it will do you
e stranger still made no reply, I
but gradually his mouth grew small- I
er; and his lips contracted, and the I
air rushed into his throat with a
whistlingsound, like the winter wind a
through a broken window pane.
At length the barkeeper took com
passion upon his writhing ueastomerni
and gave him a glass of ice water to I
cool his throat. When the stranger 1
was able to speak, he looked reproach- I
fully at the "medicine man" and said 4
"See here, stranger, if that'S the
kind of stuff you give a man for 1
grasshoppers, I'd like to know what
in - you'd give a fellow if lie had
a tape worm !
How. M. C. Kaum.-The Cincinnati
Commercial, and indepedeednt journal,
pays the following graceful tribute to
the Hon. M1 . . Keer, of Indiana, who
will probable be thie next speaker of
the National House of Representa
tives I
Michael C. Keer, of Indiana, is one
of the ablest Western Democrats who
ever sat In Congress. Sound on the I
financial question and on the tarriff, I
he is equally sound on all questious I
that involve the security of the Trea- I
sury and fidelity to olfficial duty. lie I
has the intellectual ability and grasp I
whiich would qualify him for the 4
Speakership, though he may be de- I
leient in those arts of popularity I
which gave to Sebhuyler and which are I
found, combined with strong intel
lectual qualities, in the most recent
incumbent of the Speaker's chair.
Mr. Colfax, it is said, won the Speak
ership by sheer smiling and solicita
tion, writing hundreds, if not thoo
sands, of letters in vocation to mem
bers elect, soliciting their influence
aud votes. Nobody wh6 knows Mr.
Kerr would suspect hinm of stooping
to such electioneering tricks as these.

PRESERtVING APPLEs, PEARS, ~'
-The Royal Horticultural Society "
England, considering the preserv:
tion of hardy fruits, for winter IwI
next in importance to growing thel:
offered prizes for the finest specime:
of apples, pears, &e., kept until li:'
in spring, accompanied with descri'
tions of the manner in which tihe
had been stored. Thcey then publis'
ed the following summary of the i:
formation received:
As the flavor of fruit is so ensi!:.
affected by heterogeneous odors, :
is highly desirable that the apple a:lL.
pear rooms should be distinct.
The walls and the floor should 1
annually washed with a solution t"i
quick.lime.
The room shonld be perfectly dr:.
kept at as uniform a temperature :_
possible, be well ventilated, ant:i
there shall not be a thorough dra':.
The utmnat care should be take:,
in garnering the fultt, which should bt'
handled as little as possible.
For present use, the fruit should ,he
well ripened; but for long keyping it
is better, especially with pears, thalt
it should not have arrived at coIIm
plete maturity. This point, howeverv,
requires considerable judgment.
No imperfect fruit should be stored
withll that which is sound, and every
more or less decayed specimen should
be immediately removed.
If placed on shelves, the fruit
should not lie more than two deep,
and no straw should be used.
Where especially clear and beauti
ful specimens are wanted, they may
be packed carefully in dry bran, or
in layers of perfectly dry cotton
wood, either in closed boxes or in
large garden pots. Scentless sawdust
will answer the same purpose; but
pine sawdust is apt to communicate
an unpleasant taste.
With care, early apples may L:
kept till Christmas; while many
kinds may be preserved in perfection
to a second year.
Value of Sugar-Beets for Fatten
ing Swine.-An experiment was re
cently made in New Hamphslire up..
on a Suffolk pig wherein sugar-beets
were largely employed in fattening.
The animal was about a year old, and
the feeding on boiled sugar-beets,
tops and roots began on the 16th of
August, and was continued three
times a day until the Ist of October.
after which ground feed was given,
consisting of two parts of corn and
one of oats, three times a day, till
the animal was slaughtered, the meal
being mixed with cold water. The
result was, on the 16th of August,
when the sugar-beet feeding was be
pounds; Nov. Ist, 520 pounds. Thi:
is the substance of the statement
given, by which we pereeive that th"
ecrease the last of August, when fed
on boiled sugar-beets, was at the
rate of two pounds per day. The
same rate of increase on the same,
food continued through September.
When fed on ground corn and oats,
made into cold slop, the gals for the
next fifty days was less than a pound
and a half per day.
The real waste among well-to do
farmeris the Boston Journal of Chem
istry says, "is in the throwing away
of house slops, and in allowing the
liquid excrement of animals to be
lost. It is better to advise farmers
to save every drop of the liquids of
the house and barn, than to urge
them to pile up huge heaps of inert
substances to be used as fertilimers.
A heap of dry mueck or peat, whiclk
in itself has no special value, may be
used advantageously to absord the
valuable liquids of the house andl
barn, and in tills way a fanner may.
,largely increase his mannrial resourc- *
es without incurring great espense."
Mr.. W.'s Ftittel.r-Save all your
bite of bread, soak themn in cold wa
ter and mash fine; add a little nut
meg, three or four large spoonsfuls of
sugar, part of a teaspoon of salerm
tus dissolved in two large spoonfuls
of milk, a little salt, and stir into thls
flour enetrghl to make a batter stih
enough to hold up a spoon. Drop a
little from thile end of a spoon inte,
hot fat, and fry as you would douglh
nuts. After one trial no bits of bread
will be wasted.
To cure a colt of puiling at his
halter, place a stiff spring pole i',
front of himr, but out of sight behind
his manger. Pass the halter stra,
through a hole in the partition, and
tie to the spring pole. It all is pro.
perly adjusted, the colt will try hin
entire strength without breaking
loose, and will be apt to go back t.
his manger a great deal quicker thant
hIe backed away from it.
