.WAsr~i1TOx, Dee. 7, 1875. e
Editor ti .dicator-- a
To say that the Capital waecrowed lu
yesterday, when ,Congatss b aivened,
would not express its ti tie condition.
Men, of all sizes, kinds and ehlor, and
women of assorted looks and ideport- ,'
ment, clambered, in with &iti4e haste,
and soon filled the galleriesa' almost o1
suffocation. What they alt. wanted, tl
is strange to imagine. rybuidy ii
who possessed an idea abo .itlhat ofI
an oyster knew that bot 'llouses
would merely organize and qd(journ, a
and also the lnature of that ,0rganiza- b
tion. Yet this great unwasled mob
thronged the galleries, lhbbipe, aisles, g
stair-ways, doors, anti-ronms, tt~, i1si.
the hundreds, so great was their, idle i
curiosity. They would nndoubtly
have so acted to witness an exeun- e
tion or a marriage. Office-begging is t
the disorder of the day and evening. a
It seem every one wants something e
for himself or his friend, and that t
friend is frieqiently a woman. Yes- I
terday the Senate had no sooner a
taken a recess than four irresistable t
stylish pull-backs waltzed into the
Senate, introduced themselves and c
proceeded to tell the senators-espe
cially the elder ones-why they want- "
ed such and such an oflice. As an
other instance: The other evening II n
met Col. Levy, of your town, the first a
time we had met for several years, a
and in the short space of ten minutes, i
le was called aside tfur times and
handed seven cards, by these vam- t
pires. But this is only the begining. z
After the committees are appointed
will come the tug of war, and the or- t
deal will be severe to members who iI
have little patience-to say nothing of I'
of the wear and tear of their coat !
lappels. I guess I amu about the only a
one who is not a candidate. There r
are so many applicants in the field, hit
that I am satisfied the country nill
•not beat a loss foir public servants. n
It seems that the mania, however, is
contagious, and I might have been
induced to run for something had I t
known what position I wanted. I u
never have held office, and would not
nown--unless I could sell it, and it
paid well.
THE SENATE
is composed of 773 members-42 Re
publicans, 29 Democrats, and two In
(dependents-Booth, of California, and c
IHamilton, of Texas. There is one a
vacancy - being from your State,
which seat Pinclhback claims, but with
little chances of success.
The House is composed of 92 mern f
hers, but one vacancy (from Tennes
see) also exists. Of this member 174
are Democrat, 104 Republ:cans and a
1 0,Independents. Eighty of these I
SDemocrats are from tile South, of the i
292 members, only 108 eier before I
served in Congress, and of Ihis num
ber 68 are Republicans and 40 Demo
crats. There are 21 contested seats,
, of which contestants 15 are democrats
and 6 republicans. There are six col
ored men in the House and aone in the
Senate--Bruce, of Mississippi. The
indications arefavorable tlhat fifteen
Republicans, one colored anl fourteen
plain, will be ousted' from their seats
early enough to afford them sufficient,
time to get home by the holiday sea
THE LOUISIANA DELEGATION
were sworn in and took thleir feats.
The qaestion of referriog the contested
seat of Frank Morey to a committee
on .erdehtials, was voted down, Mo
roy was sworn in, and the ease will
come up before the House on its own
merits. ::
SR. L. Gibson, o5 the t .Loaisiana
District, will probably be appointed
chairman of the Committee on Levees
on the Mississippi.
,The New York lerald, in casting
its "political horoscope," predicted,
with its usual iecnuracy, that tile Lon
isiana telegation would be divided
on the speakersrhip-that Col. Levy
wdild alone vote for Randall. Tile
SiHerald ebrfriinTiaht basse this' sup
position on. the face of seeing Col.
dLevy, with several other Congress
- men, call on Mr. Randall, at Willard's
a few evenings before the caucus met
SCol. Levy, Gibson and Ellis --the
-. Democratic delegation from youir
St~te, voted for Kerr, ''first, last and
all the time."
As far as I can scertain,!the'South
ern Democirats were about eqially
divided: on IRandall and Keei. That
"'back-aliry gtab" is what beat Ran
dall.
e ]Gibson, of tihe firt District, will

alttee on Levees,

His OPPOIr:TUITY.-In allusion to c
- the Speakership the Baltimore Ga- m
zette says : I
1 Mr. Kerr has before him an oppor
tunity for party leadership which few
Smlen have enjoyed. He comes to the
i position with ia high estimate placed ti
upon his resolute integrity, tirmness il
of character and coimprehensiveI h
stateslanshlip. His past public ca - b
'reer promises much, and the palt 'y r
and the country exllect much in f al- sc
I fillment. His election was a ftittng Is
supplenent to the speech of Gen. La ai
a. ir, and is an earnest of the c;arry, di
ing out of the coniprehensive lpolicy p
indicated in its sentiments. lI
Under Mr. Kerr's nmldiu2 hand it
the House of Representatives will t4
I mark out a bold, aggressive policy,
t which will assure the success of the
t National Democracy in 1876(, if it suc- el
ceed at all, on right prilnciples. But c
whether it bring sueec'ess or defeat, the tl
priloiise for ait return to coiistitutional rl
_ government honllestly administered si
was never so nee r realihzation-as it is ti
to-day, with the party following the si
1 counsels of its. Lamlars and Kerrs, a

To Stop Blending at the Nose.-It
it worth while to know how to stop
bleeding from the nose when it be
colies excessive. If the linger is
ipressed linrily upon the Lttle artery
that supplies the blood to' tlle side of
the .fe allfected, the result is acc.al
plished. The two siliall arteries
branchingl iltp from the main tirtelrles
on each side of thie neck, and passing
over the outside of the jawbone, sup
lily the face with blood, If the nose
bleeds fromll the right nostril, for ex
-ample, puss the finger along the edge
of the right jaw till the beating of
the artery is felt. Press hard upiou
it, fland the bleeding will cease. Coln
tinue lthe pressure five milnuteNs, nntil
the ruptured vessels in the nose have
time to contract.
Value of Evergreens Among Fruit
Trees.-A well-grown evergreen tree
gives oat contilually an exoliumn of
waralntl and moisture that reachees a
distance of its area in height; and
when tree planiters advocalte shelter
belts, surlounling a tranet of orchiard
tifty or llmore acres, when tlhe influ
ence of such belt can only trace ia
dlistanie of the height of trees onil said
belt, they will do that which will
ilprove of little value. To aitmeliorate
