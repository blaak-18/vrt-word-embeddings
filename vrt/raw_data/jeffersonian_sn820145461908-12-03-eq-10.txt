The Tate of the Pioneer.
The originators of very nearly all
great, far-reaching reforms have gen
erally been despised and in many in
stances repudiated by the genera
tions in which they lived.
A few days ago I read in the col
umns of The Atlanta Journal a very
vile, narrow, and vindictive editorial,
in which it saw fit to bury the Hon.
Thomas E. Watson politically, making
the announcement to its readers that
Mr. Watson is politically dead. Pos
sibly in a great many instances, it
can be truthfully said of a great
many men that politically they are
dead. By virtue of the fact that the
ideas they have promulgated were
contrary and directly opposite to the
best interest of the common weal.
Naturally when it is said of him or
an individual that they have, passed
off the theatre of man’s activity, gone
from the stage in which the drama of
life has been enacted, an individual
of common sense, reason and observa
tion will most invariably ask himself,
Why all this? Why have the public
so universally condemned this man or
that one, and if it be a fact that this
or that individual is lost from useful
ness and stands repudiated by the peo
ple, why is it that others who have
been of but very little worth to the
times in which they live still appear
upon the hustings, and to a certain
extent help to shape public sentiment ?
Some time prior to the National
election I purchased a copy of The
Atlanta Journal from a news boy.
passed through the lobby of the Kim
ball House and into a quiet and ob
scure corner of the Kimball House
reading room for the purpose of pe
rusing its columns. Sitting not far
from me was Mr. Watson, chatting
with one of Georgia’s best and lead
ing Democrats, one of as good men as
it has been my pleasure to know. This
prominent Georgian was discussing in
a friendly way with Mr. Watson some
of his literary efforts. When the not
ed Georgian had gone I shook hands
with Mr. Watson and, having heard
him make a speech in a certain sec
tion of the State, just prior to this
incident, Mr. Watson asked me about
the aftermath of his speech in that
immediate section. I said to Mr.
Watson, “To be frank and to ex
press it as concretely as I can, they
are giving you h —l.” Mr. Watson
asked in what particular.* T said,
“Tn substance, they are charging that
you are insincere, that the Republi
can party is furnishing the petro
leum that oils the Populist machin
ery.’’ Mr. Watson fixed his eyes up
on some object looking at it intensely
for a few moments, and said: “It is
hard to fight for truths that you rev
erence, and then to have your motives
impugned and your character black
ened.. Sometimes I feel like hauling
down my flag.”
The air in which Mr. Watson ut
tered these words impressed me very
much. T shall never forget just how
he looked. I differ from Mr. Watson,
but I do not for a moment question
his integrity, his loyalty to the South,
and to the best interest of the coun
try at large. The man who uttered
these splendid words is not dead —
“Not until men have found the way
Xsl)c Tlkffersonian
to kill justice, and to chain the
thoughts of men will they ever be able
to put bad laws where they are safe
for the future.”
Again, just after his first fraudu
lent defeat for Congress in the
Tenth, it was heralded by the public
press, that Mr. Watson would leave
Georgia, take up his residence in
Washington, D. C., and go to writ
ing. To this his reply was, “I will
remain in Georgia among my people,
proudest when I can serve them best
and happiest when they love me
most.”
A man who gave to the country the
rural free delivery of the mail and
the car coupling act is not dead, and
were each individual who is directly
benefited by these two noble measures
to give him one crumb of gratitude
he would today be the most popular
tribune in the United States. But
posthumous gratitude is about all the
pioneer gets. When he is gone the
generations coming behind him realize
and appreciate the good he has done
and commemorate his deeds in bronze,
marble and granite.
The seventeen thousand and up
ward of pall bearers of Mr. Watson,
as The Journal is w r ont to designate
them, are ready to follow him to an
other one of The Journal’s burials.
When the man who penned that un
generous editorial has passed into
oblivion, boys in colleges and debat
ing societies throughout the country
will be repeating in declamation Mr.
Watson’s orations and writings, and
by firesides in the great Republic of
France and other nations of the globe
they will be reading his historical
productions.
The two men who voted for Abe
Lincoln in Georgia were ridden on a
rail; later on, the peerless, eloquent
and immortal Grady declared Lincoln
to be the first typical American. Jo
seph E. Brown, the sagacious states
man, was bitterly denounced, just aft
er the war, for the political course he
pursued. Today history is busily vin
dicating both the wisdom and the in
tegrity of his attitude then, and so
it has been all along the line.
The intrepid mariners have always
been condemned while exploring and
navigating the seas of hidden truths,
but those who have followed after
them have had the manliness to rec
ognize their foresight, appreciate their
sacrifices, and wisdom. Many brave
and good men labor earnestly and in
tensely building houses for others to
dwell in. The task is a thankless
one —they love it, and it is good for
humanity that they do. For in this
idea and in this unselfish devotion lie
all the seed of progress.
