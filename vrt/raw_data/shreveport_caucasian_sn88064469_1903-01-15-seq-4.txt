THE CAUCASIAN.
Official Journal of the

THE CARN\EGIE LIBRARY.
The Caucasianx will admit that it is.
at times. unsentimental. cold-blooded
perhaps. in its view of questions and
measures which affect the public, and
being free and untrammeled. gives ex
pression to its views in its own peculiar
style. \et. at times. its sympathy may
le as tender and as gentle as that of a
woman. Since the defeat of the proposi
tion to vote a special tax in aid of the
Carnegie library "rich men" and "cap
italists" have been criticised in indefin
ite terms because they contributed to
the defeat of the tax. The critics have
not viewed the question practically. and
it may le said that tlIe tax would not
have been defeated if the Caucasians
editor had not pointed out to several of
his friends the objections against the
Carnegie preposition. As sensible, prac
ticable men the objecti'ns were ensid
ered in a conservatnvi e spirit and the
rre' i< historical. In tead of being
criticised. :h' "innttmen0 ' who cotri
buoted to t:e d'fe-t of the Carnegie
proposition shoold be commended.
On this score we reproduce from The
Harlequin. published in New Orleans,
the following:

al candor, that while the Carnegie li
Irary. in a magnificent edifice, would be
c:i ornament and some attraction, still
the conditions and the cost of inainten
once would not justify the tax for such
a luxuary. In no personal sense, we
cite, however, the example of George
Peabody. which Mr. Carnegie could
follow in the distribution of his mil
lions. We could never fancy any dona
tion with a string-tied annex or condi
tions. and therefore could not regard
the library, proposition with favor.
From this view of the question we con
sider all adverse criticism of the defeat
of the tax unjust.
LINCOLN'S PICTURE.
Some of the ex-Confederate camps of
Mississippi are' protesting against the
placing of the painting of Lincoln in
the hall of fame of the new capitol
building and tensuring Dunbar Row
land, the State historian, for asking the
Lincoln family' fr 'if. Mr. Rowland's
mistake was not silatural. During the
campaign for president, through which
the country last passed, the Democratic
candidate at the head of 'the ticket went
up and down the land preaching. Lin.
coln, quoting Lincoln and making him
the patron saint of Democracy.-Com
mercial Appeal.
Lincoln's picture in its place is not
objectionable, but when singled out in
opposition. to the Southern man's ideal,
then . it. should be set aside. There is
little in Mr. Lincoln's political life
which can appeal to a Southern boy; a
boy whose grandfather or father was a
follower of Lee. or Jackson. or John
ston, nor should 4Lincoln's picture be
singled-out of all the president's of the
United States for an adornment in any
schools of the South. There is too much
of the spirit of "the toady" and of
"flankeyism" connected ° with some
schools in which the thildren of South
erp men and women are taught. If pic
tures of illustrious men are desired as
ornaments why not select Washington
and Lincoln and' Jefferson Davis and
{eneral. R. E. Lee- for practical illus
trations of teaching in :noble manhood
and patriotism. 'Wi)y single out Lincoln
-'and not Washington? Why Lincoln
alone in any school of &he South?
'Judge Alton B. Parker of New York
is coming more and more into promi
nence as a presidential candidate. He is
popular in' New- York and there is no
stain on his record. Neither Hill nor
Gorman can unite the party, and Parker
seins to be the coming man.-Guardian
Journal.
Of 75,000.000 of people the Demo
cratic party will no doubt settle on a
leader who will secure victorf over the
Republicans but we do not think Judge
Parker- is the man. Hill is politically
as dead as German and your Uncle
Grover.
