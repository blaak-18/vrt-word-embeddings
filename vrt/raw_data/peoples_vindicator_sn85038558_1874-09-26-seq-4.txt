There is no monthly Magaziine an in

cumulated. Hlarper's is edited. There
is not a Magazine that is printed which
shows more intelligent pains expanded

There is not a cheaper Magazine pub

Harpor's Weekly deserves its primacy
in this class of publications, alike for the

' VýEGETABLE SICILUAN
Every year increases the populari
ty of this valuable Iair Preparation ;
which is due to merit alone. We
can assure our old patrons that it is
kept fully up to its high standard;
and it is the only reliable and perfect
ed preparation for restoring GRAY
on FADED HAIR to its youthful color,
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white
and clean. It removes all eruptions
and dandruff; and, by its tonic prop
erties, prevents the hair fiom falling
out, as it stimulates and nourishes
the hair-glands. By its use, the hair
grows thicker and stronger. , In
baldness, it restores the capillary
glands to their normal vigor, and
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old ago. It is the most eco
nonmical HAm DRESSING ever used,
as it requires fewer applications,
and gives the hair a splendid, glossy
appearance. A. A. Hayes, M.D.,
State Assayer of Massachusetts, says,
"The constituents are pure, and care
fully selected for excellent quality;I
and I consider it the BEST 'REPA
RaTION for its intended purposes"'

FOR THE WHISKERS.
As our Renewer in many cases
requires too long a time, and too
much care, to restore gray or tided
Whiskers, we have prepared this
dye, in one preparation; which will
quickly and effectually accomnpli-sh
this result. It is easily applied,
and produces a color which will
neither rub nor wash off. Sold by
all Druggists. Price Fifty Cents.

Cherry Petoral,
For Diseases of the Tfhroat and Lungs,
such as Coughs, Colds, Whooping.
Cough, Bronchitis, Asthm~a,
and Consumption.
Among t':e great
discoveri:s of mod
ern science, Tcw are
of more real value
to mankind than
tlhis ellectual rcm
ledv for all diseases
of the Throat and
Lungs. A vast tri
al of its virtues,
throughout th!s iad
other cauntries, has
shown that it does
surely and effectally control tiem. The tes
timony of our bhst citizens, of all classes, es
tablishes the fact, that CiaaE l'racTORAL
will and does relieve and cure the alictiug
disorders of the Throat and Lungs beyond any
other medicine. The most dangerous all'c
tions of the Pulmotimrv Organts yield to its
power: and eases of (onsumption, cured
by this preparation, are publicly known, so
remarkable as hardlr to be believed, were
the:r not proven beyond dispute. As a rem
edy it is adequate, on whbch the public may
rely for fill protection. By cwi';. cought
the forerunners of more serious disease, it
saves unnumbered lives, and an amnount of
suftering not to be computed. It challenges
trial, and convinces the most scentical.
Every family should keep it on hand as a
protection against the tarlr and unperceived
attacks of Pulmonary Afections, which are
easily met at first, but which become incurq.
ble, and too bften fatal, if neglected. Tender
lungs need this defence; and it is unwise to
be without it. As a safeguard to children,
amid the distressing diseases which beset the
Throat and Chest of childhood, CHuRRY
I'EcTronatAL is invaluable; for, by its timely
use, multitudes are rescued from premature
graves, and saved to the love and affection
centred on them. It acts speedily and surely
against ordinary colds, securing sound andl
health-restoring sleep. No one will :suffer
troublesome Influenza and painful Brou
chitis, when they know how easily they can
be cured.
Originally the prodnuct of long, laborious,
and successful chemical investigation, no cost
or toil is spared in making every bottle in thei
atmost possible perfection. It may be coufi
dently relied upon as possessing all the vir
tnes it has ever exhibited, and capable of
producing cures as memorable as the greatest
It has ever effected.
