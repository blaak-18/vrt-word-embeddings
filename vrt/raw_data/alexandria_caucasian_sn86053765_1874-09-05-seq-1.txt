The Commodore then illustrated
Iiis position by .various instances
where gentlemen of much preten

* Hut," said the Commodore, "I
recall a case l Ii .t I regard as worth

4 General Pikestaff had, yeat s

lintiinate neq-iantanocs to taste its
excellent quality. Old Doctor J.,
whose sensitive appreciation in
such mailers was proverbial, altei
a long deliberation, pronounced it
as undeniably delicious. •Yet' said
the Doctor, with a modest apology.

"Impossible !" remarked flic

a prolonged history ol the liquor 1
and of the care with «hieb it had

"The Doctor, however, politely
declined to yield."

WHITE LEAGUE.
The Louisiana Slate Register which
seem« to be more honest than Repub
liean Journals in this Slate usually nie
after commenting on the organization»
of the White Leagues, the object* of
which it either misunderstands or inis
represciits, nays :
1
Let as for a moment examine the
other side, and see what excuse, if any,
th« White League lias for its existence.
Since the reconstruction of the seceded
States, tint republican party has had
full control of the legislation of this
State, mid generally the ofllees have
been filled by mem hi rs of that party.
The party was pledged to give the
State an honest, ecouumical govern
llieut, r«> fill its otiices with lespectahle
men, in «liom the community conlil
have confidence No sane man will
deny that the 'cpuhlicnii putt> has si.
tar, utterly failed to give the people
i he goveriinient that was promised, and
which they had a light to expect. We
need not lecount the jobs, that have
beeil put up in the le^islatuie to en
i ich its members and laverifes, or al
lude to th«* inonopi.hes euacicit by pie
• ended tepiililieniis that, oppress tin
people. Pledged lo reform, forty per
cent of ihe. bonded debt of the State
lias been repudiated, and Ihe conse
quent tell net Ion of taxes is referred to
b\ iispiring politicians, as among the
good woik« of the paity. Rat where
lias tlieie been any leduetioii ofexcis
sive salaries, oi of useless ofllcers ?
No w here*! I lie last Stale Convention
adopted the usual resolution in favor
ol honesty and capacity for office hold
ers. Yet «e see the same men, win.
have put up jobs that cuis«- ihe p-rty
and State, and who nie unworthy «>1
anj confidence or respect, clamoring
•or seats iu the Legislature, and the
chief executi*e ot ihe Stale, is lending
his iiitluence and patiouage. to sccuie
their success. The men uim arranged
the St. Louis-Hotcl-Stalc llous|.J». :i se.
winch the A'lornev General character
ized as an attempt to rob the State, are
to lie leturtied, if possible when they
may y et be enabled to complete that
most outriigeous scheme of pubfic rob
Itety. In their efforts to gel back to
the. legislature they have the active
aid. and patronage of ;i lepublican
Governor to assist them !
('an it bo wondered at alter reading
the foregoing that a larye class of the
people ot the. State are desperate 1 Can
we honestly attribute their lawless
ness to the inherent original outlawn
that possesses them f There is one
sure cure for the White League, and
w hich, if properly administei • d. would
leave it as dead as the legions of Julius
Osar. L<t tlie repiiblicaa party In
honest, and true tu it» own priuciplei
and piomises, and there will be li<
noce While Leagues. Instead ol
thieves ill office, let honest men fill
their places, and let the pluudciin^
horde that lias lohiied the Slate be
politically buried. Then |>rosperit,\
and peace, and good will to men, will
come to us all. The remedy is easy —
but w ill it be applied T
From one of Eli Pet kins'Sarato
a letters: "Just, then a young lady
from Louisville, Kentucky, p issed
b\ all dressed iu red and blue and
yellow and white. The Louisville
young ladies all run to blight col
ors. There ! continued Miss Kel
logg, 'that young lady is wearing
the crude notes of the natural scale.
No sympony—no harmony—not
even a chord. How much moie
agreeable to the cultivated eye all
these colors would be if they were
mixed together. Mix the red ami
yellow and bine and white in prop
er proportions and she conhl have
Ihe lovely pongee, or slate, or dove
color, or Bismarck brown or sage
green—all lovely symphonies."'
The ladies appear to have been
even more enthusiastic than the
men when Goldsmith Maid made
her astonishing time at Saratoga.—
A gentleman states that on turn
mg around lie saw a woman near
him waving her liamlkcrchicf with
all lier might ; but on looking down
he saw her baby lying at her feet
and beginning to cry. "Madame,"
said Iii », "yourchild," pointing to it.
*'Oh," said she, "I forgot, all about
baby, but it makes no difference-;
I expect to have several babies, but
I never expect to see another Gold
smith Maid."

The August returns of (he Depart
ment of Agriculture showed an im
provemeut in the eolton crop in nil
the Stales except Alabama in which
dining July the avernge decline was
2 per cent Xirginia declined 2, Ar
kansas 7 and Tennessee G per cent ;
the fwo Stales last named complain
of an extensive and severe drouth —
North Carolina maintains her .Tidy
average. South Carolina reports a
considérable improvement, while
Georgia advances her average 1 per
cent, Mississippi 2 per cent and Flor
ida C per cent.
From several counties in Louisia
na come complaints of a local drouth,
impoverishing the growth of plants ;
iu others heavy rains have caused a
very large growth of weeds, with n
'endency to long joints and small
fruitage.
The caterpillars nre reported in
many localises, but they appear to
be genera.ly even later in their ile
ve open ent than the crops. Sever
al correspondents think they are too
late to damage an y but top crops in
counties.
The bottom crops are poor, while
the middle crops are luxuriant where
a good stand was secured. The
crop is generally reported as better
tli'in for years.
Louisiana suffered severely front
freshets in the early part of the sea
son, reducing her July average to
seventy-three. The disastrous con
-eqnences were partially remedied
by the improved condition of growth
in July, but still the crop is seven
teen per cent below the average in
some parishes, us in East Feliciana.
The working force of farm animals
was seriously injured by fhe charbon,
causing the crops to remain un work
ed at critical periods. No serious in
sect injuries are foreshadowed, and
the tone of correspondence is more
hopeful.
Texas increased her high average,
showing a general and satisfactory
improvement. Insects were ^foulon -
s! rating in different qjiajt'ters, but
were met by remedies. >
Since the returns of August to the
Department, the dronth has contin
ued, causing considerably greatei
d,image to the crop, tiian was first
expected. The caterpillars are doin<_'
no injury in this section to the oldei
cotton, but too doing damage to tin
voting plant. The hill crops will be
very short, while the bottom laud
will average two-thirds of a bale pei
acre. Picking has become general
and soon the crop will be coming in
to market.
