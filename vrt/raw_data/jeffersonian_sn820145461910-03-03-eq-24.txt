niooooao I PIIKQ don’t claim to cure cancer, leprosy, and in-
Ulbuubub I vlllU curable diseases, but I do claim to cure and
ACTUALLY, POSITIVELY CURE many that others consider in
curable. I have cured thousands of serious chronic cases—many cases
that others have failed to cure. I want to prove what my treatment
will do for YOU. My free treatment is the best test—it is the one
convincing proof. No matter what disease you have or how long you
have suffered—no matter how many remedies you have vainly tried —
no matter how many other doctors have failed, you should not hesitate
to try my treatment. Curing chronic cases is my specialty. Thou
sands have been restored to vigorous manhood and womanhood. Won’t
you let me try to cure you?
