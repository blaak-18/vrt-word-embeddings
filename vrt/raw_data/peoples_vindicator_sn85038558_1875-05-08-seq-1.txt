want of quietness, troubles and things
in general in your parish during the

Q. By Col. Field-June of what
year ? .
A. Last June, a meeting of persons
was called. It was called the Tax
Resisters' meeting • it was composed
of the tax-payers. At the meeting
there were addresses made by ditfer
ent attorneys-one of the attorneys,
by name, M. J. Cunningham, address
ed the meeetiung, and in his speech,
made use of a remark, saying that the
people had showed cowavrdiee and
that if they wanted they could drive
out of office those men in them witht
"hickory sticks'?; or "big sticks"' -.I

Q. Up to last July t
A. Up to last June--though in 1868,
for instance. there was some trouble
at that time, but it had 4ll passed
away ; there was qnieqnp to last June.
I was speaking of the month of June,
at the time of Mr. Cnahningham'a~
speech. There was a portibhn of tile
persons jresent at that meeting who
were not tax payers-a great tnRfly
of them did not pay a 'dolliir' worth
of taxes in that parish or in any otlher
parish.
SQ. What wasthe meeting: com
posed of-white people
A. White and colored. A few of
the people tlht wer dbre with them
withdrewr fromthem. It:'s's'taited
that it was not a political meetinog
but that it was an asseOlhtion of tfir
payers and that they:intended to "put
down the taxes. Thle7 passed reso.
lations at that meetiugcondemning
tihe Police Jnry who wea t lei blicansl
and who had been in 611e since .'last
February, but the men on tho~dPolice
Jury who were Denoerata ,were re
tainedin oficee, ifthey wouldptomise
to do better ;' but these nibti were de
termined tr have thO Riaublicans re
sign; they passed a: peolution to
that effect .
. Yot tay they passed a resole
tion to thateeet ect
'A. Yes, sir, tliy paiited' 'tesolt
tin kit thbat< effeet. On the 4th day
of July, therSaturday tellowing, the
Repqblicans held a mass .qeetiug in
tlhe Parish of N'iticiloces. It was a
peaceable and quiet meetilg as they
had usually up to that time. At that
time I received information that there
were goodsmaay nn utidet arms, sahd
aeape .tine afterwards they 'would
es f d backwards all. t~,
im."ldf[ tobt know what they were
tiu at use'time.' We heard that
moue' clared men conting to the aUtet
inghad been stopped. Abqut thbat.
time, I 'w somme armed men pgpling
through a garden. I could not say
as to t e exact number, but I think
therem we soame eight or, ten. We
were then give to undetsrund that

Q. Dei'c-"rat?: o .Z'-'
A. Yes, sir. 'When they came on
tie boat I was sitting on the after
guards: of the boat~ talking with a
s Frenchmam, MIr. Barrow. I think he
was one of the State hRegistra:rs. At
the time Charleville came on board,
as I said before, we were sitting near
the pantry, on the after guards of the
boat, talking. lie persed me with
out seeing me. He pliied ini and
gota drink from the Water cooer. I
then after that went into ~ny room.
I don't suppose I had been ill my
room two minutes when they were
around again looking for 111me. I could
not understand what was aid, as iny
door was closed. But Mr. Charle.
ville went to the clerk of the boat to
,get tile nnumber of my room. lie did
not get the number of my room. Mr.
Jose lenry," who was on tihe boat, pre
t Y'a!ed wi'h1* him ,,ot to touech ho. lie
said, I have got 1000 hales of cotton,
I wmould let it go to get that lmau. 1
Gllderstood lie used this conversation
on the boat.
Q. By Mr. Marshall-Are you tes
tifying to facts within you own knowl
edge. If so, I object to thie ' ituess
testifying to facts outside of his own
knowledge.
By Mr. Frye-As I understatnd you
to say you saw these men coming on
board at that station f
A. Yes, sir, I saw them come on
board. They haid pirepared to do the
work they came prepared to do.
Q. Did you hear them say so ?
A. Yes, sir', I heard them anad I owe
my life to Capt. Sinnott.
Q. You came down to New Orloans?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Is there any thing further you
desire to state ?
, A. I returned to the conve .tion. I
was at home on the 25th of July.
Q. How long did you remain there
A. I was there in attendance of the
convention. I was nouminatted for the
22d senatorial district.
Q. Subsequently, what took place.
State any thing you may know show
ing intimidation or anything of that i
kind ?
A. On the 25th of July I was at the a
convention which nominated Mr. ii.
Twitchell for the G26th Senatorial Dis
trict At that time there was a meet.
ing held by the whites in, Firemen's
Hall. Yon could see into the room 1
where they were; they were all arm
Odr? .
Q. By JMr. Marshall-You say they
were all armed, how (do you know f
.'. A. Well, sir, we could see them
through tihe window. It was general
ly understood by the public that they
were there for thie purpose of pre. I
ventitg'the nomination of the Parish <
Judge and District Attorney.
Q. By Mr. Frye-What did you un- •
derstandl was tliepurpose of that as- E
sembly ? .
A. I understood that they were as- '
sembled for the purpose of assa.sina- I
ting the delegates of that convention t
who should nominate a 'eandida:te for I
Parish Judge and District Attorney.
Q. What effect did that assembly c
have upon the convention ?
A. Well, sir, it had the effect to in- (1
timidlate them. I spoke to the mem. I
bers of the convention and they were I
a few of the White Leagues there. 1 t
suppose, of. course, they came to t
see what was going on. Mr. Cun- c
"aingiham was There wllitling with his s
kuite. I spoke to the people, prevent- '1
ed antd didall I could to prevent an '
altercation between the two parties.
i yspoke aboit ,the crops and I
how important it ,.was for the two c
races to be friendly and that the pros- a
pet Iwas that w'e would make a bet- q
tar erop this season than at any time t
since the smurrender tom y knowledge. j
Q. By Mr. Frye-That was a cot
ton crop ' t
A. Yes; ecotton crsi. I mention- J
ed these things in the convention to c
show Ijow thesiq~rest of thie two r. a
ees wats internilhgled. Fronm some
remarke that wr6' made, I concluded

P;lan,ts lire a double life. They
have a two fold nutrition-nmineral
acid oiganie. Their mineral 'food is
derived front the soil and the organic
from the air. While the organicoPn
stituents of plants are generally noi

ashes it is discovered that the differ
eat classes are marked by the preva
lence of certain mineral . elementf.
Some abound in potash, others' ii
silies. Different parts of the ensae

re'asl why all crops are lint snitedl
to the saunme soil is a lar'iatioii of thli
mineral elemecnts. All crops are not
suitiedi to the same soil, ansd mainly
because it is delicient in certain min
eiil elemlentis, or they exist Iu tod
large quantities.
The fIrtilization of soils is thil ad

apply to their roots manures yielding
amtuionia, carhbonic acid, nitrogeni
etc., we supplement the atnioipherio
supply' and hasten their developnnget.
Liquid imalnures are, thqltfore, tof
