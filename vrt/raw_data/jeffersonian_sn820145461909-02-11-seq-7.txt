community, with a membership of
75 Christian gentlemen; many would
have gladly voted for you if they
had been reading upon the political
situation. As it was, only three of us
voted for you.
I do hope you. will call a mass meet

so you can attend all. When you come

heaven’s blessings rest upon you, is

SOME FINE RESOLUTIONS.
Norwood, Ga., Jan. 30, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson.
'Dear Sir: I enclose some resolutions
from the Reynoldsville Local,- which
we would like to have published in
the Jeffersonian, if you see fit.
Yours truly,
R. N. Ray, Sec.-Treas.
Resolutions From Reynoldsville Local,
No. 1604, Warren County.
Whereas, we believe the plan that
has been suggested by the Jefferso
nian in regard to raising the price of
cotton to be a good one.
Resolved, first, That we stand ready
to send in our dollar for that purpose.
Second, That we ask all county and
local Unions, not only in Georgia, but
in all cotton states, to pass similar
resolutions, for we believe it will be
a move in the right direction.
Third, That a copy of these resolu
tions be sent to the Jeffersonian and
also a copy to the Union News.
Fourth, As a b.ody of Farmers’ Un
ion men, we certainly appreciate the
interest and good will which the Jef
fersonian has offered in our behalf.
This 30th day of January, 1909.
S. H. McCord,
President pro tern.
R. N. Ray, Secretary.
WATSON FIRST CHOICE.
- -
Hackberry, Okla.
Dear Brother Watson:
I think the sham battle has cleared
the way for Populism as the Demo
cfatic party is dead. Let us have a
conference soon. If you accept the
nomination, there is Dixon or Wil
liams to head the ticket, and many
others, second place—a good man from
the South.
The Missouri World is going to stop
as Pops will not pay the dollar. This
is a shame. Think how faithfully he
has stood by the people, and now they
will not stand by him.
Your best friend and well wisher,
who never will surrender,
S. M. Langdon.
FROM THE PUBLISHER OF THE
“AMERICAN WHIP.’’
Lancaster, Pa., Jan. 8, 1909.
Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: I have just read in
your Weekly of Jan. 7 the communi
cation taking you to task for certain
sentiments expressed in your edito
rial, “By What Right?’’ published in
your issue of Dec. 17.
I remember how well that editorial
expressed my opinions on the sub
ject of sending large sums of money
to the heathen of other lands while
large numbers of persons in our own
land were in dire distress, and in need
of such aid and sympathy first. It
has seemed to me like a lack of good
discriminating judgment and misplac
ed philanthropy to send millions of
dollars and many missionaries to for
eign lands, while many from those
lands were right in our midst, and
many of our natives, whose circum
stances were certainly first entitled
to benevolent and pecuniary consider
ation.
Your editorial was so well timed
and written that I would have trans
ferred it to the columns of my paper
if space could have been spared.
Yours respectfully,
Ezra J. Weaver,
Publisher American Whip.
SUGGESTION AS TO SCHOOL
BOOKS.
Calhoun, Ga., R. F. D. No. 5,
January 29, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I have just finished read
ing your editorial on the school book
change and endorse it in the main,
but would it not be better for the state
to purchase a printing press and print
all the school books?
I think this would be even better
than the plan you suggest—letting
the printing by contract.
If I remember correctly, I read some
years ago that Indiana let her con
tract to print to a private firm, and
first readers were to be printed at
five cents apiece. My best recollec
tion is that Indiana ordered one mil
lion first readers printed and that the
publisher acknowledeged to clearing a
profit of thirty-five thousand dollars,
thereby showing that they could have
been printed for three and one-half
cents each, actual cost.
Now, I think that the state could
soon save enough on the printing to
pay for the press.
Would it not be better to let the
state place the school books in the
hands of bonded book stores, and re
quire the bookseller to sell them at
cost, plus ten per cent for handling,
etc., than to furnish them free?
I fear that to furnish them free,
there would be even less care taken of
them than now.
Yes, every candidate for either
branch of our legislature should be
publicly put on record on this as well
as other questions concerning the pub
lic welfare, and then our governors
should really go before the people
and tell on the members of the general
assembly when they do not carry out
their pledges instead of threatening
to do so, and then endorsing them in
an effort to get to the U. S. Senate.
Respectfully,
J. M. Christian.
_(Ed. Note: State-work is so apt to
let in the grafter. Remember South
■Carolina Dispensary. Besides, there
would be less opposition to the plan
if the book-printing is to let out to
lowest bidder. T. E. W.)
WANTS NATIONAL AND STATE
CONFERENCES.
Stafford, Kansas, Dec. 30, 1908.
I will enclose a one dollar bill for
your Watson’s Magazine, to be sent
to W. T. Buckler, Stafford, Kan.
Let the good work go on. Let us
have a national conference and a state
conference in every state. I see no
UgO in putting ouf, a national ticket
tSfye 3tffersoiilan
without state and local tickets to back
up the national work. People are get
ting tired of Bryan and the Demo
cratic party; Democrats are getting
tired of voting the Democratic ticket
and throwing their votes away. They
are ready to join a new movement.
The Democratic County Chairman of
Stafford county has resigned and says
he is done with the Democratic party
forever, and will work with reformers
hereafter. H. D. Hewitt.
WARNED AGAINST “BAD COM
PANY.’’
Ivan, Texas, Jan. 23, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I want to compliment you
on the good work you are doing, and
also I want to warn you against the
bad company you are keeping since
you started the Jeffersonian. In my
opinion socialism and that sanctified
element known as the A. P. A.’s (or
Orangemen) are the most dangerous
element that Uncle Sam has to deal
with at the present time.
I am surprised that a man of your
intellect would allow a letter to be
published in any of your publications
such as appeared in the September
number of the Jeffersonian Magazine
from one Louis Ransom, a narrow
gauged bigot from the land of cod
fish and beans. Your man Friday
(Tom Dolan) seems to be tinctured
with socialism, and you and he both
seem to think that the Catholic
Church is about the only barrier to
an ideal government.
I was born and raised in the county
Limerick, Ireland. I am now an
American citizen and the South is the
land of my adoption. lam a Roman
Catholic from the ground up. I never
belonged to a secret organization and
never intend to. I intend to be a sub
scriber to both your papers if they
don’t become polluted by socialism
and A P Apes.
J. R. Creagh. •
NAME “JEFFERSONIAN’’ IS
MISLEADING.
Xenia, 111., Jan. 26, 1909.
Dear Sir: My faith in Populism is
very strong. Jeffersonianism is all
right, but misleading. The Bryanites
are claiming faith in Jeffersonian prin
ciples,—hence misleading.
Success to you and yours.
J. Stonecipher.
JEFFERSONIANS GOOD MEDI
CINE.
Find enclosed M. O. for $2, for
which please send me another dose of

this prescription since several months
before casting my first vote, and am
well pleased with results. I am not
taking this for any ailment', taking
it as a preventative only.
As ever yours,

TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown in
Georgia. It has every good quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
