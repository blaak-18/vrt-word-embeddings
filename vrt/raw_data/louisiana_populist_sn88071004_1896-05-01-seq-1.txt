FRANCE'S WAR SONG.
WHO WROTE LA MARSEILLAISE
IS A BURNING QUBSTION.
LEvdence that Olves the Abbe 'esMoa
emaz Credit for the IuMae--tory Told
by Aleuseder Boecher - Two Clalm
ates for the Hosr. V
E ARE beginning
to wonder whether
there is any truth
In any historical
tradition, however
seemingly well
founded and gen
erally accepted,
says the Rochester
Democrat and
Chronicle. Of all
min o r historical
Anecdotes there is none more unques
lioningly received than that which re
lates the story of the origin of the
great French war song, the "Mar
selllaise." Everybody knows that a
trench captain of engineers, Claude
loseph Rouget de l'Isle dashed off both
Words and music in a moment of in
spiration, at Strasburg on the evening
of April 24, 1792, and that the hymn
was first sung on the following evening
tt the house of Mayor Dietrich.
You will find these a:leged facts re
corded under the heading, "The Mar
b pellaise," in every book of reference
aDpurporting to give information on the
subject. The tradition has been un
t questionably accepted by hundreds of
writers and artists, French and other,
who have found it a source of inspira
1 tion. And yet, unless that very inter
esting book of personal memoirs, "An
Englishman in Paris," is to be regarded
s as merely clever fiction Instead of the
a record of facts it purports to be, there
it scarcely a word of truth in the tra
, dition.
Rouget de i'Isle did not compose a
single note of the music of the "Mar
seillatse." He did not write the whole
of the words. Those of them that he
wrote were written slowly and deliber
r Itely, as poems are usually written.
The words.were not written at Stras
burg In 1792. They were written in
1791 at Marseilles, in the fortress of
St. Jean, where Rouget de l'Isle was
then imprisoned for his refusal to take
ait oath to support the constitution.
Rotget de I'Isle naeer had the honesty
to openly acknowledge his Indebted
sms to those who helped to make his
name immortal, though he acknowl
edged It privately when he couldn't
help hlmself.
The two stories which seem to estab
Boh these points in regard to the au
thorship of the "Marseillaise" are
worth retelling. The first was told to
the author of "An Englishman in
Parts" by his tutor, who had witnessed
the seeae he described. Here it is In
substance:
"We were all more or less aware
that Roget de l'Isle was not the au
thor of the whole of the words of the
'Marasillate,' but some of us in Lyons,
whie I was born, knew who had writ
ten the last strophe, commonly called
the 'st$phe of the children,' and I
doubt whether they were any wiser in
Paris. Some of my fellow students
for I was 2$ at the time--credited
Andre Cheater with the authorship of
the last strophe; others ascribed it to
Louis Preaeois Dubois, the poet. All 1
this was, however, so much gsuess.

The other story was told to a Freai
journalist by the man who really com.
posed the music of the "Marseillalse,"
Alexandre Boucher, ; celebrated vio.
Uinlst. He improvised the air, in 1790,
in the drawing-room of Mme. de Mon.
taigne, in Paris, at the request of a col.
onel whom the musician had never mel
before, and whom he never saw again.
The soldier was starting next morning
with his regiment for Marseilles, and
r pressed Boucher to write him a march
there and then. One may imagine
BI oucher's surprise when he 'heard hib
march sung everywhere.
TALLEST IN CONGRESS.
An Inocident i.n iLs Law Iractlc* That
Led to iEs Marriage.
His name is Cy Sulloway, he is 6 feet
6 Inches in height and probably the tall
est man in congress, says the Globe
Democrat. Foy twenty-one years the
Manchester pe'tple have been saying
that some day (`' should go to congress.
So here he is. Well, in his younger
days Cy rather wandered from the path
that led to the church in which the rest
of the family worshiped. He had wild
oats to sow and he sowed them. While
engaged in thVls occupation the salva
tion army people came to town. They'
held their nteetings upon the street
corners and, of course, they gathered
crowds. This it happened that one;
day the polite came along and arrested
them-carried off lads and lassies to
the station house. The news of the ar
rest came to Cy as he sat up in his barn
of an office and it made his big heart
feel sad. He wasn't religious, you know,
but he had enough sympathy to take
In all the world. "It doesn't seem to
me to be qjite right," mused Cy, in his
queer, honest way. "These people have
as much right to worship God in their
way as I lave to worship Him in mine,
I think I will go down and see them."
So dowo he went. He told them that
he had st me little reputation as a law
yer, and If they wanted his services
they were welcome to all he could do,
without lgoney and without price. They
listened, thanked him, and then thank
ed God, singing the doxology as he
went awry.
"Curi~us people," said Cy to himself
as he mntved away. "There they were,
as hapE y as if they had all been at
home. They said they were in prison
like St. Paul, but they knew that the
Lord would send his messenger. Talk
about faith in Israel! They had more
faith tl.an I have seen In Manchester
in all my born dayp!"
The next morning Cy was true to his
promin. He went down to the polick
court, made an eloquent speech and
had the satisfaction of seeint, the lads
and la3iles walk out of thC court ae
quitted. Then Cy began to go to their
meetiqlp; then he was converted, and.
finally, on a visit to a little town in
Massm husetts, he met a salvation army
captal i, who is now his wife.
Old-Time Tea Drtaktig.
You will o~serve that in the year 1740
tea wt s taken twice a day, in the morn
ing ard in the afternoon.
Thg taking of tea belonged essen
tially to the higher kinds of town life.
Yet the taste for tea was already de
scend'ng into the lower grades. I have
a learned treatise on tea, written by one
Simonz Mason, of whom I know nothing,
in the year 1746. He says: "Tea is good
upon many accounts for persons of high
living; for such this same genteel
drink was intendbd, as it is most agree
able to their worth and dignity; ant it
may sot be altogether above the reach
of the better sort of tradesmen's wives
and country dames. Btit nowadays per
sons et the lowest class vainly )mitate
their betters. and prevalent custom hath
intranuced it Into every cottage and
my gammer muost have her tea twice a
day."
This I take to be exaggeration; but
in some eases, I have learned, ladies
met to take tea, not because they liked
It, but because it wasAbe proper thing
to do. In order to counteract any poe
ibles bad etects of the tea, they all
tooks drams afterward-ratala, cus
coa er gin-and went home with lam
ing cheeks. Mch better, says my al
thor, for a blyer or afterneoo's regnle
is a dreught of good ale with bread and
dheese or cake. Better still, he says, is
te made freeom sage and balm. I lbe
lieve that sage teels still prescribed by
