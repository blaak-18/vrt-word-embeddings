This is the only Big 801 l Cotton that has all
the good points, viz*: Strong, Thrifty Stalk, Big
Bolls, Staying in After Opening, Large Yield per
Acre and Highest Lint Turnout. The Special
Feature of Superiority of this Cotton over all
Others is the Largest Lint turnout, which is from
36 to 44 per cent. This cotton is recommended
by U. S. Agricultural Department and sought for
; by every Cotton State in the South. I know all
about the Georgia cotton for I farmed there for
ten years, and I KNOW that it will pay you to
plant this cotton. You send for my book, and let
me tell you all about it. My friend, Mr. Watson,
is going to plant some of my cotton. If you will
read Mr. Watson’s publications and plant my cot
ton, you will have a combination that the world
can not beat. Will send all a sample of the seed
who mention The Jeffersonian.
