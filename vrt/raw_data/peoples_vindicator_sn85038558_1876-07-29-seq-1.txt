Little Phil is no more afraid now
than lie was twri *inter' ago in New
Orleans. At that time tie atmos-.
iphere of Red River was impregnated
with assassination, now it is the at- Th

River seat of slaughter was three or said
four hundred miles froli New Or g pr

Cllicaigo. Little Phil doesn't stauil most
on a matter of ai htundretd miles or so. e
tie is just as feairless in Chicago to- Their
day its lie was in New Orleans nine
teen mollith ago. Thllat's the kind of inot a

many mis-ivings, "Come in," lhe was a ll
straigihtway colinfronted with anl al- d
parition so torn and . crumpled sir
and travel-stained and terror- rdPeU

Myers who had been ostracised about --bi
seven tlonlths previously and had igh
been living ever since in great peace
and comuti't in New Orleans. What try
passed betweeni those two will never a do
be disclosed by us, but Myers must
have come a very cruel game on the get
confiding; whliole-souled .Mick, for nest heal
day ia most pathetic telegram starled esi
the United Btatel with the tale of rasid
Myers' woes and persecutions, lair- and
breadth 'scrapes, and grisly accidents
f by flood and field. "A victim has
just made his escape fromn Red River, g,
t the Hon. Judge Myers, etc.," wrote o a
poor little Phil in great emotion. ,e
But that was the last time his nerve The
e weakened. After that lie preserved the
e a dauntless front against all the as- wid
a t ssination and impregnation of Red wid
I River atmosphere that could lie put lre
do tissue paper.. botl
o Things are different now, though in
all fearless and unterrilied respects the
little Phil is just the same. He holds 6llE

o ing the very dreadful and cantanke- Thi
s rous behavior of Sitting Bull, and wit
- sends messages to Gen. Sherman in fill,
Sirlhcli there is not the fauintest symp- oth

e last report states that lie knows noth- the
e big about the matter, being too far set,
e. distant from tile spot. He further re- m
marks that he thinks he'll let Crookli
II and Terry take care of themselves as the
it he has always done heretofore. Lit- tol
n tle Phil's composure under these a
t alarming.cdreunStandes is truly won.a

pot bellied little man's record and let
sum up his nsefulnesi and honor to an,
the country, we feel that something thi
must be done to eiecept him from the w.

Farm and Household:
Dogs vs. Sheep.
The great curse to wool growers i*
said to be dogs-lean, lank core that
go prowiung about over the country
seeking what they may devour; and
of course the flock ot sheep are the
Imost palatable fool at hand. Sheep
men have begged and pleaded with
the law makers. and all to no purpose.
Their prat ers lave been heard, but
not answered, and their dog-worship
ing neighbors have been laughing-ia
their sleeves all the whilc. In the
meanitimie, vcjrious remedies have
been suggested. Sonie lave advised
bells, but about the only atvantage
in them is, that they make a noise
and thus let their owners know what
is going yn. In many. instances the
bell weather is among the first killedQ
or the only one killed. However,
like to leava plenty of bells on the
lnck ; hot I don't keep. theun on the
sheep to keep the dogs off-only be
calse I like to hear them "jingle."
There is one dog law, however,
that will protect the sheep if it is ent
forced; and that is to get the dog be1
fore lie get, the.e sheep, and thus rid
youir neighl~rs of a nuisance. Don't
u~e a gun, it will make too mach
noise. Keep your own counsel. or
you may get the repntation of being
a dog-killer, and then all. loge mis.
sing will be charged to you. Such A
reputation might be expensive, be
sides having the ill will of your neigh.
bors--no man desires that. When
you see a straggling dog aroqnd donu$
wait till he kills your sheep-it wilI
lie too late to do you much good then
-but call on him right away. At
night, leave some nice fresh meat and
strychnine where he will find it, and
he. will pot troiuble you ony more. If
a dog should die on your premises)
get him out of sight as soon as pose
sible, and all will be well. Don't
hesitate in thi niatter, if your dog
f raising neighbors say it is sneakinl
:arod mean. Be a. law unto yourslf
and enforce it.-Rural World.
SSurplus ioney.--A very good way
to afford the bees room tostore honey,
ti to cover thie hive with section boxes.
These I have nade ivre inches high,
the ends of the sections it in.hees
wide, the tops and bottom It inches
wide. Thus it will be seen the end'
It are close fitting, while the top amn
bottom will be open so the bees cd
pass through. ly attaching oonb td
ý the top bars the bees, so that wited
Ifilled the section can be separated,
each section containg a single comb.
The hive can be entirely covered
d with these sections;, apd when partly
'n fillet raise the whole nup and place an
' other set beneath, and the bees will
is readily pass down through; and if
i' the honey season holds out, fill both
r sets, anm in good seasons perhap4
more. If these section frames arte
pl~ced across the hive it would make
s1 the sheets of comb rather unwieldy
to handle or to transport to a distasces
eno I think it better to place a rest
Saero, tlie centre on top of the frames,
At and place two shorter sets of ;sections
rid lengthwise of the hive. There il
tanother advantage in this way, au4
Mg that is, aq tie combs run theesame
e way with t tleo d1 the frames in the
e- bidy of the have, no lIhrm will at
' arrive if thle hive is not level from
in front to rear, and would be the cae
f in hlaving tihe sections placed the
r- other way. To keip these esctians
a together whlile haunliig, a case made
le of thin stuff should bie nade, with a
m thin strip nailed around the bottom
le to. prevent the eriloics slipping
.te thirough. By tilaseing thtm in this
es case, they can be pot on or taken of
we without trouble.
' If boxes-are uobed, I find it better t4
make them Isarg enough to have
them cover time lhive if lacced .eroes
wise. The boxes can he made of 4i
. size to suit ones fancy, large or small;
he though I prefBr lairger ones, having
ns. the set justab cotei the hire, placing
no rests upou the bars for. the ends of
ld the boxes to rest upon, ilsinig theli
s as high as the sides of the hive pro
ts ject ahove the frames; thius giving
nt thle bees a full pIasnge between the
er boxes and. thle top of-le franlCes. I
at tlhink it well to bake two holes la
large leoxes an inch and a half in di.
gtl ameter for i!ngress to the boxes. In
the one side cut out a circular piece three
'0r inches iii diameter, covered with glass
n upon the inside biy which to display
ow the couitedits of,tlie box. When tlq
