Sarsaparilla
Is widely known
as one of the most
effectual reme
dies ever discov
ered for cleans
ing the system
and puriftving the
blood. It has
stood the test of
years, with a con
stantly growing
reputation, based on its intrinsic virtues,
and sustained by its remuarkable cures.
So mill as to be satfe and benetii-ial to
children, and yet so searching as to
e!i etually purge cc:t the tgreat conrrup
tions of the blood, such "as the scrufi
ulous and syphilitic contan:iuati;n.
Impurities or diseases that have lurked I
in the system for years soon vield to
this powerfil antiiote, and disappesar.
Hence its wondertul cure.", manv of
which are publicly known, ofScroiula,
and all serofihloos diseases. Ullcer.s
Eruptions. and eruptive disorders of
the skin, Tuunors, Blokthes, BoiLs,
Pimples, Pustules, Sores. St.
Anthony's Fire, Rose or Ery
sipelas, Tletter. Salt Rheum,
Scald Head, Ringworm, and in
ternal Ulcerations of the Utersu
Stomach, and Liver. It also cures
other complaints, to which it wonuld not
seem especially adapted, such as Drop
sy, Dyspepsia, Fits, Neuralgia,
Hieart Disease, Female Weak
ness, Debility, and Leueorrlmea,
when they are manifestations of the
scrofulous poisons.
It is an excellent restorer of health
and strength in the Spring. By renew
ing the appetite and vigor of the diges
tive organs, it dissipatcs the depression
and listless languor of the season.
Even where no dlisorder appears. people
feel better, and live longer, for cleansing
the blood. The system moves on with
renewed vigor and a new lease of life.

No one remedy is loueder
called for by the necessities
of the American people than
a sure and safe cure for

we are now enabled to offer,
with a perfect certainty that
it will eradicate the disease, and with mse
ance, founded on proof, that no harm can
arise from its use in any quantity.
That whichl protects from or prevents this

is better than cure; for theim patient escapes the
risk which he must run in violent attacks of
this balefiul distemper. This "CURE" expels
the miasmatic poison of Fever mand AgeO
from the system, and prevents the develop
ment of the disease, if taken on the irst
appro.'k f !ts pren onitory symptoms. A
great sucperiority of this remedy over any
othLer ever discovered fqr the speedy and cer
tain cure of luterinittents is, that It contains
no Quinine or mineral; consequently it pro
duces no quinism or other injurious effoects
whatever upon the constitution. Those cured
by it are left as healthy as if they had never
had the disease.
Fevrer and Agne is not alone the eon.
