We bid good-by to our kind friends city
for bout three weeks. Daring the gr
•9 ears of our manhood we have qu
nevr cast out our lotin a commnity by i
whom we have been treated with fail
such uniform kindness and courtesy "'
as by the good people of Natchito- a l
I chee. We have not made an acquint- the
Saee here that has not cemented Into ens
a warm friendship on our part. Wo her
. could we part with them forever for thi
any pecuniary consideration. Our to
chief will remain at the helm until 9"'
our return, when he can take a holi. thi
day. If the "boys" of the Pieaato- thi
rl Society be good, and don't coax ek
t. him, or our "devil," off during our for
n absence, we may bring them some or
' improved fishing poles from the city.
If they do though, ey must be pro th

U1 rangements to increase the alze of 't
the VIwNecATOn to double its present ac

course, will incur a heavy outlay; but 5
n the substantial recogntlon that our
m labors have received from our mer- .I
Schants and business men here and ti
elsewhere, and the rapidity with
oer which new subscribers are being ad*
ded to our already large circulation,
more than justify us in the underta- n

hblbited thus far is, we trust, an earu

Colored George Clark was charged

A good veterinary surgeon is a de- l

of the diseabs of the horse justifies
him in offeing himself as shob, and
the recent cures that he has effeoted
are ample evidence of his skill. A
mare was put in his charge a sew
weeks ago, whose life could not be
insured for ton dollars, lad now she
