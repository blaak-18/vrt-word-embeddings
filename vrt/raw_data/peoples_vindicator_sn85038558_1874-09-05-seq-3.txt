Addrebs to the People of Red
Blver and our Adjoining Sis
ter Parishes.
We the people of Red River Parish.
do hereby tender to our neighbors
and frienas eour adjourning parishes
our sincere and heartfelt thanks and
everlasting gratitude for the prompt
and eicient aid rendered us at a time
when a serious riet was eminent,
which we believe was only prevented
by the anprecedent prompt action
and determnnation of our friends co
operating with our tree sons.
to ten or twelve hours we had a
thousand brave spirits ready and de
termined with their lives to assist us
in defending our homes wives and
children-we owe to you kind friends
a deep and lasting debt of gratitude.
To the colored people we have to
say that our action in the present
instance most fully convince you of
the sincerity of our repeated declar
ations that "our warewas only against
such of you as are silly and vicious
enough to combine with the horde of
scallawags and°darpet-baggers who,
like vultures, have been preying upon
our people for eight long years, and
whose voracity seems to be insatiable,'
To all such we give fair warning. To
those who want peace, and the re
demption eLouisiana we gearantee
ample ptteetlo in the full and free
exercise of all their civil and political
rights under the law, and we earnest.
ly request you to gol peacibly and
quietly to work. Some of the bad.
white men who have been for years
inculcating vicious ideas into the
minds of the colored people of Red
River, and arraying them against the
true interest of the country, the white
peopleand their own, were arrested
for their complicity in a cold-blooded
murderous assassination upon our es
timable citisen Joseph B. Dixon.
They have tendered their resignations
and left this morning at their own
earnest prayer and request under a
guard of our best citizens selected by
themselves, to depart from the State,
promising never to return as will be
seen by their statement hereto annex

e are not permitted to incite them to
their own destruction. They have
but to demean themselves as good
citizens, and they will see that the
s strong arm of the white man will al

oppress them.

A Prophecy ? or a Threat.
We learn that an officer of the U.
* S. stationed at this city, declared yes
- terday, that United States troops will
' be sent here to enforce the rights of
Radicals, white and black, to vote.
* If this was said as a threat, or if the
officer spoke advisedly, we can assure
him that the coming of United States
troops to Louisiana is a matter of
small importance to any of the white
people against whom they may be
sent to operate. The people of this
State who are opposed to Radicalism,
and to negro rule as exemplified by
the Kellogg usurpation, have no
thought of interfering with the right
of any Iwan of any color to vote as he
may elect ; but they do solemnly pro-.
pose to exercise that privilege theam
selves, spite of Kellogg, spite of mne
tropolitan police., and spite of the U.
S. troops. The Federal uniform .has
always commanded proper respect
from our people and we regret to say
that the time has been when rather
tihann appear to be in antagonism with
the General Government, we have
permitted ourselves to be sat upon,
and have yielded when the right .was I
with nus, apd when submissiou meant
humiliatiou an pecuniary disaster.
We have, however, arrived at the 1
conclusion that if the Uttited States
otfficers so far forget their duties as toe
permit thrnmelves to be used as the]
tools of a local faction in a State con
test, they deserve no more consider
ation than any other man and should
be treated as ordinar ruffians. The
example of Arkansas and other States
where United States troops were
treated as impertinent intermeddlers, I
has taught us the folly of' yielding i
more than a proper obedience and ]
I respect to the blue coats and bayonetse
of the Federal soldiery.
If'the soldiers choose to get mixed
up in broils with which they have no
concern, they must expect to comet
out with pdoched heads and torn uni-:l
forms. The time hls passed when a i
blue coot stuack up on a pole eaa makIe

•ernment we yield to none.; we pro- 1
:pose to oebey the laws and to ac3 with- I
in them-in short, we propose to 1e ,
all that may become men, bat so 2
more.. So we say again that tiheres
can be no troeble in Louisiana unless I
it is rashly preelfitated by the inju- .
dicious une of'Federal troops, and.4 J
far as the whit~ p iple are c'ierned,
tiles are quite as determined, to see
fair play for the negres, as the most I
blatanta Radical in the 8tate.. 1

In the present humor of the country
people it would require but very littli
to bring on such a revolution as will
make every carpet-bagger and scal
awag treumble for his personal safety.
Should the work of retributioa once
begin, there i i6otelhlidg to -what ex
tent it iill "go. For six years, now,
the people qo Louisiana have sulbmit
ted quietly to every species of indig
nity that could possibly be put upon
them. They have seen their proper
ty confiicated and sold to put money
into the pockets of white adventurers
and debased negroes; They have
seen the Government polluted and
disgraced by the presence of men who,
miore properly should be inmates of
the Penitentiary. They have seen
themselves robbed in the boldest pnd
most unblushing wanner, of their po
litical rights, and deprived of the
privilege of electing their candidates
to office. In fact they have endured
more than auy other free people un
der the sun would have done. They
have been looking forward patiently
to the day when the cruel outrages
upon them as a people, would be
slopped by the power of.a Govern
ment that should be administered iml
partially and justly towards all the
country. But they have grown tired
at the delay, and restless under "the
hope deterred." They believe now
that their only salvation depends
upon their own exerti.bns, and they
have resolved to look in the future to
themiselves. That they will act in ac
cordance with this resolution there
is no doubt, and that they will achieve
a glorious victory over the enemies
of the State, there is not a shadow of
doubt.-N. O. Bulletin.

A Card. '1
For some time past, I have maintained
political opinions not in accord with the
prevailiug sentiment of those who have
hitherto been my political friends What
those opinions are, all who have convers
ed with le know. They were honestly
my convictions; and I believe that fu
tore events will prove that may judgment
was correct, and thit. thp..aurest way to
practical refornt at tj) 1~eiqut juncture is
for all really Liberal men to give their
support to all persons, white or colored,
outside or indide the Republican parry,
who would join with theml in a crusade
against corruption. In other words, that
the true feature of this campaign shiuld
have been Reform, and not political os
tracisma. My convictions are strong, and
cannot be changed. I leave it finr tlw
future to prove the wisdom of my course.
My object in writing this card is to
announce publicly what I have declared
privatelpy-that I shall throw no obstacle
in the way of the success of the White
Man's party. I have no desire to enter
actively into the present campalign
against the sentiment of my people. If
they win, I shall certainly not comnpla;in:
if they lose, the tault shall in no part be
mine.
My position as a McEnery Senator, to
which my friends attach importance, de
mands this explanation from me. I
stand upon the platform of 1872. oh
which I was elected, and shall at all times
be ready to do justice to all men with
out regard to color or race.
This is not a withdr wal from the Re
publican party, to which I have ntever
belonged. It is simply a public statement
of the position I shall occupy in the
present campaign.

lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a cenitry the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemished repuitation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscella,eons reading matter.
It is ire-eninently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
ia religious or political sense, or that
eonuld not be read at any tiresjle without
objection from the most fastidious.
i'he circulation of the Naturday Even
ing Post, through lqt quite so large
perhaps, as its yonnger contemporaries,
ts not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, ahd too oftell bhort-lived,.but
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneuous influences, such as the populari
ty of individnul writers, &de.
G(wodf however, as the 8atnrda ,Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability andknown reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and 'adding many judicious sd pDeas
lug nwvelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in.
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each eh and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
