local governments strong id brave
enough to do it. and in a pllic sen
timent that will back nla short,
sharp and decisive campaig against
corruption.
IIe says that whlat tiloe States

ity to throw upon the federa! govern
nlent the duty of preservi!. order and

7 the federal powewr has u4 effectively
done and could not .o. Rather
through ignorance at healquarters in
Washington and the invqitable mis
use of so great a power by distant
I and irresponsible agents,the federal
force intended only to proerve peace,

ends of unscrupulous polticians who,
in the name of the Reprblicans par
ty, sought only to advanii their own
corrupt political fortunes
This agrees with 'a reinlrk we hoard
Mr. Penn of Louisiana mike last win
ter in the presence of Mr Pinchlback.
Said Mr. 'ennu: "I believe I could
get more negro votes for governor in
Louisiana to-day than Kdilogg could."
"I do not doubt it," saa:; Piuchback
"for they have looked tai' Keliogg for
protection and failed to goýt it." Mr.
Nordofl's testimony is strong on an
other point--naniely, that the pree
sure of the federal gover'nmiuut has
crowded the whites together and
forced the political division on the
color line. Remove that pressure and
the whites would divide into Wigs
and Democrat, into progressives and
conservatives. The old VWhig elo
ment is still strong, still distrustful
of Bourbon Democrats. Vice-Presi
dent Wilson learned that fact by res
lpu(ses to his letter of last winter, and
Mr. Nordhoff's testimnouv filly sus
tains it. The colored voters would
be in demand, and their vote being
dividled too, they would no longer

The Republican party in the South
has been and is composed of tolored
men officered by "carpet-baggers."
A wiser administration would, have
appointed to federal ofices the natn
ral leaders of the South and made the
Republicanii party strong and respect
able there. But that has not been
the policy that dictated the work of
reqonstruction. We see the result.
The States that have been wrong side
tip are turning over-_-a perfectly na
tural process. Local, self-govern
blent will be restored, but the Re
publican party will lose the credit of
it.--Bosloa lerald.
Hydroyhobia,
Profuse Persperition a sure cure.-We
reprint an article which appeared in
the Picayune of July 2, 1874. The
importancbe of the subnhject dascussed
and tile eminent source from wvhich
the discussion emanates, will com
mend the article to all:
SDr. Buisson, a celebrated French
physician, has been very successfal
In the cure of hyprophobia by the
simpJe application of hot water baths.
His remedy. Vl',tally consists in dri
ving out the poison. from the systenm,
or at least rendering .It inoperative,
by forcing the sufferer into a profuse
prespiration. He therefore directs
thait when a person lias been bitten
by a mad dog he should, for ,seven
consecutive days, take a viapor bath
of 134 degrees to 144 degrees Fahr.
This hed designates the preventive
remedy. When this has not been
done and the disease deelores itself,
Dr. Buisson states tlihat it will biesuf
flicient to counteract the effects of the
disease'to take one vapor bath it
which the temperature is made to
rise rapidly to98 degrees Fahrenhiet,
and then slowly to '127 degrees Fahr
renhiiet, the patient keeping his room
till the cure is complete. As to the
vapor bath, thle sirmplestis as effica
cious as the most elaborate. A few
red hot 'bricks placed in'a pail of Wast
er, over whi:chithe patienlt its in: a
cane-bottemed. chair, a large blanket
covering him in from his. shoulders to
the floor, will answer perfectly.
I)r. Bisson's remedy resulted from
his own experience, he having got
upon an abrased finger some of the
poisoned saliva from a female pIatient
in the last stages of rabies, lie not
only cured himself after every syrnp-.
tomn had been developed; but hle has
since treated with this remedy eighty
distines eases witihout losing a single
patient. I!l his el~alrate essay on tihe
subject,.in the Sald:Pnblique, he re
fersparticiilarly to each of the cases
conilng under his eare sarid'cured by
him.-'

KILL Yocu FisH WH\EN YOU CATCH
'Exr.-Agassiz was accustomed to tell
his pupils how to kill a fish as soo00
as taken from the water, because the
flesh of the fish that die as soon as
1 taken from the water is much better
than that of those that suffer before
dying. Professor D. D. Slade, in a
lecture before the Massachusetts
Board of Agriculture, says: "Vari
ous modes of killing fish are practi
ced. The Dutch destroy life by mak
ing a slight longitudial incision under
tie tail With a sharp instrument. On
the R!hine they kill salmon by thrust
ing .;'f eel needle into their heads.
Fish',u'y be easily killed by striking
them oi quick, sharp blow with a small
stick on the back of the head, just
behind the eyes.' And the professor
continues: "it has been observed
' that fish which have been instantly
killed on being taken from the water
are vastly superior in taste and so
lidity to those who are allowed to
die." This information might lie
very properly and usefully circulated
in our schools.
CoUTERPEITs.-We are indebted
I to Mr. Charles Lehman, of the United
States Internal Revenue Department
of this city, for the following facts
relative to some dangerous counter
feits now in circulation:
j Ten dollar bills on the National
SBalnk of Richmlond, Indiania.
' Five dollar bills on the Paxton Na
r tional Bank of Illinois.
'l u ditMr 1,; r gi.. .ntha h*et N4
tional Bank of Canton, Illinois.
Five dollar bills on the Trader's
National Bank of Chicago, Illinois.
Five dollar bills on the Merchant's
National Bank of Chicago, Illinois.
Five dollar bills on the Third Na
tional Bank of Chicago, Illinois.
Also that Five dollar bills on the
Osage Nation Bank of Iowa, number
ed over No. 1750, were stolen from
the Bank and have forged signatures.
This information to our business
community and the public generally
is of great value, and by preserving
this scrap many may be able to de
tect the counterfeits.
Chieago Times: Senator Sargent
has becn making a neat little flonacial
compatation, which is being printed
e triumophantly in all the Administra
i tin papers. "Have you thought,
Sfellow-ctizens'," said he, "that the
I reduction of the National debt has
a been $120 a minute since you have
lsat here and I commenced talking?
Taking the average of the whole
h time, the reduction of the debt has
1 gone on at that rate. Why, take
e your watch and look at it. See the
i second-hand as it flies; at each tick
- of the second-hand two dollars du
, ring the whole time since Grants in
, auguration, by day and by night,
Supon week day and upon Sunday
s two dollars in gold per second lIas
a gone off the National debt." And
s when each Admistration paper has
a printed this computation, it exclaims,
."comment is nsuperfluous." The Times
a will venture to make a little compu
Station of the same sort. Have you
ever thought, fellow-cititens, that you
are being taxed at the rate of $2,t093

rate. See the second-banud as it flies;

e the'beginning of the year 1875, by
- day and by niight, Sundays, and week

THiE NEW KNow-NOTHINo CIu
SADE.-A new Know-Nothingamove
ment has been set on foot It is call
ed the American League. and was
first organized in 1871. We are told
that it has 40,0041 members in the
State of New York, and will run a
complete ticket for State officers in
the eletion ofNoveminer. Its great
principle is that none but Americans
born in this country and of American
parents shall he eligible to otlice;
and it proposes tha;t the naturaliza
tion laws shall be anmndemd according
ly. It also lays donvu the doctrines of
absolute non-interference in religious
subjects, thou"gi it holds the law of
the land snipremul above any Church
or secret society, make up of lodges,
with pass-words, signals and oaths.
We do not suppose it cani amount to
nmch at present. The exclusion of
foreign-bhrn citizens anld their chil
dren from the right to hold otlicue i
society based on religious intolerance
might gain strength, but this sort of
thing will not enlist so many sup
porters.--New York Sun-Edt.
WAT'r TrI Cox'rur WANTS?-
Gold is chiefly useful as a means of
settlingi balances between communi
ties and nations, In a perfectly
healthy condition of the country's fi
nances gold is not needed at the far
domestic exchanges. But the momelnt
these finances become deranged, and
gold is sought by the fearful and dis
trustful capitalists, it cannot be paid
out. The outward flowing stream is
soon exhaustef and the gates are
shut. Now, what the country wants
is enough currency and a cessation
from financial tinkering until confi
dence is entirely restored. Theou pe
cie payments lmay be resumed with
out harm to anybody. But go on
tinkering and eurtailing currency un
til it may be assumed that there is
not enough paper afloat to enable the
people to exhaust the stock of gold
in the banks and the government
vaults, and there will not only be not
a tithe or twentieth of enough money
to conduct the business of the coun
try, but half the business-men of the
land will be hopelessly ruined.
The Vicksburg {lHerald of last Tues
day thus briefly rlfers to this terrible
disaster:
The horrors of the great innunda
tion in France continue to increase,
rather than diminish. Nine hundred
persons are reported to have perished
in the flood at Toulouse alone, while
it is believed that as many as twen
ty-six hundred houses have been
swept away in that town and its en
virons. The money loss is Ilaced at
the frightful figure of seventy-five
millina nof adhllars. The outbreak of
a great pestilence is now feared. As
a year of disasters, the first half of
1875 will compare with any of its
predecessors. Floods, fires, earth
quakes and shipwrecks have followed
each other with frightful rapidity.

The editor of the Pittsburg Iron
World, who has been travelling in
the south, has come to the conclusion
that the South is the home of cheap
iron, and that Southern pig can un
dersell that made in any other State
in the Union. He says:
"Most persons in the Northern
States, who have seen the figures giv
ing thie cost of Iron making in the
South, have doubted the statements,
but we believe, after a somewhat ex
haustive eximinuation of the subject,
that in either of' three Stites-Ten
nessee, Georgia or Alabama-pig irdon
can be made fromt six to nine dollars
cheaper than in the most favored lo
calities of the more prominent iron
produbing States."
Some Savannah ladies have pledged

dry them in a cool oven with the
door left open, and then put them
into a mortar with a pound and a
half of lump sugar, pound well to
gether, and pass the whole through a
wire seive; put it again into the mor
tar with the whites of two eggs, mix
well with the pestle, then add the
white of another egg, proceeding thus
until you have used the whites of
eight eggs, and made a softish paste;
then lay out the maccaroons at equal
distances apart upon wafer paper in
pieces nearly the size of walnuts,
place some strips of almonds upon
the top of each, sift sugar, over, and
bake in a slow oven to a yellowish
brown color. They are done when
set quite firm through.
Seasoning.-To 3 quarts of soup
add 1 teaspoonful of salt and I of
sugary or milk, cream, or condensed
milk, or I spoonful of powdered samg
or the same of. thyme. Instead of
the wheat-meal, crumbs of bread
may be added, say 1 pint to tihe 3
quarts of soup, letting it boil more or
less aordinug to theim hardness or soft.
ness of the bread. Do not get it
thick and mush-like. Thee season
ings are not all of them wholesome,
but they are much less unwholesomo
thlan butter or pork-fat.
Stair Carpets. - To prevent the
pile from separating at the edge of
thie stair and wearing off, pads art,
used; these are made of a low grd,,
of eotton, covered with the cheapest
mnuBlin. A quilt or comfort that has
seen service will answer tie Mpurpoos
of stair pads. In addition to increas
ing the lease of usefulness of tihe
earpet, the pads prevent noisy clat
tering of feet, and, in case the baby
should, fil down stairs, the injury re
ceived would he materially lessemed.
oWhen first laid down the carpet
lshould be several inches longer tham
nieeded, tlhat it mmay be dlsposerdof
after each slhaking so that a fres:a
plheemay come to all the edges. A
wisp or small dusting broom istlm
best for sweneping stair carpetIs. Af.
ter thoroughI sweeping a wet cloth
may be used to good advantage in
renmoving all dust.
