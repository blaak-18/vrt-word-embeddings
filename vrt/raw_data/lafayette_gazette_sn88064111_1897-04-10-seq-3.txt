A full pardon has been granted
l,0..,Deforges, who was convicted
of feloniously and corruptly per
suading and attempting to prevent
a .witnes from testifying, etc., in
Ni, Orleans, February 5, 1895,
and was sentenced to serve five
yeari in the penitentiary. Desfor
gen. was one of the victims of
Ot¶ajey, and while there is little
to be said in his favor, he compares
witl*his former persecutor as the
devil does with an angel. As it
was chiefly through the tools of the
de-ipicable creature that the convic
tige was secured, the pardon of
Desfoikres will meet with the ap
proval of the public. - Mansfield

---. The Blanc case has shown that
justice can be prompt too, and that
it is not necessary that it should
wait a year or more to punish a
"murderer. It is not as brutally
prompt as Judge Lynch; for it al
lows the prisoner to prove his inno
cence if he can; but is far more
awe-inspiring than the mob which
"ears no evidence, and which nearly
always indulges in brutality.
The trial and legal execution of
the Blancs, has met every argument
advanced in support of lynch law.
It has proved that there is no need
for' Judge Lynch in any part of
Louisiana or the South. We hope
iand believe it will have a salutary
,effect in bringing about greater re
spect for the law as administered by t
San angry mob.-Times-Democrat. t

Governor Foster has pardoned bi
Louis O. Desforges, one of the no- th
torious New Orleans boodlers, ce
about whom so much was said at to
the time that the city was being TI
fleeced by members of her Council. by
Thuis, again, is the action of the It
courts undone by the pardoning of
power. Desforges was guilty of a lai
crime against the laws of the State. th
He Was wealthy and had able coun- jol
sel to plead for him and a number
of influential friends to work on the H
outside for him. He had a fair an
trial. He was convicted by a jury otl
of honest men. After his convic- ye
tion he exhausted every remedy to th
escape the penalty for his crime. re
His release from prison is another P,
instance of the pardoning power
coming between the law and its
iolators for a reason, or reasons, 4
ether than those of humanity to h
-offer in extenuation. How long is
this kind- of thing to last ? What is p
the use.of a trial,· if the criminal. is
not to be punished as the law di- fo
.rects: Are the verdicts of honest
juries to be set aside without a due
regai. for the good of society ?
A trust never helps the producer co

res Gov. Foster refused to interfere
he wite the verdict of the Lafayette
it jury and on yesterday evening the
he murderers of poor old Martin Beg
i- naud paid the death penalty of
of their atrocious and diabolical crime.
p_ There is a sickly sentimentality in
Id such cases and as usual the kind
hearted-if weak-minded-individ
uat als "fired" in their petition asking
a reprieve or a commutation of the
Id sentence, but the appeals grounded
only upon pity and sentiment, were
ly properly ignored by the chief execu
tive, and for the perpetration of a
most cowardly and atrocious crime,
Ernest and Alexis Blanc paid the
h penalty with their lives. It is well
that the earth is rid of such fiends. 4
y There was no doubt of the guilt |
of the boys. They were proper ob
jects of pity, but they deserved no t
more mercy than they extended old t

driving daggers through his heart.

e- The theory that the all-levee sys- t
Py tem confines the current, cuts out
t. the bed of the rives, and thus af
fords a deep and ample recepticle
for flood water, is now going to ,
pieces about as fast as the levees. S
Lt The all-levee system which has re
suited in the gradual raising of the
bed of the river is a complete and
most disastrous failure, and nob
' amount of talk can make it appear F
t. in any other light. Never before 6
in the whole history of the Missis- a
sippi delta have the levees been
n higher, broader and stronger than b
- they are to-day, and yet the flood t:
it has mounted above their tops and "'
y breaks have followed breaks with b
S appalling rapidity. What the end P
will be no one can tell, but these is c
reason to fear that the greater por- i
tion of the lower delta will go under c
l water.-Daily States.

- "WHAT TIHE FARMER LOSES.
e Under this heading The Hunt b
County (Texas) News has an article c
Y which should be an eloquent appeal ta
in favor of the establishment of
cotton mills throughout the South. dr
Here it is: ce
"Hunt county farmer raises a no
bale of cotton and hauls it to the p
gin. He pays for the bagging and lai
ties, $z for ginning and he then r
brings It to town, where he pays 4'
the buyer 5o cents, the weigher to tic
cents, compressing 60o cents, freight ist
to Rhode Island or Connecticut $S. r.<
This foots up $8.8o against the bale
by the time it reaches the factory. 8
It is then made into domestic and
other cotton goods and sold to the an
large jobbing houses at a profit; ci
the freight from the factory to the ads
jobbing house adds an item of ex- pa
pense. The jobber sells to the Cep
Hunt county merchant at a profit,
and then the railroads get in an
other whack at in freight from New ish
York to the retailer. Not counting t
the profit of the manufacturer and bo,
retailer that bale has been at an ex-A A
pense of about $So in its rounds.
"Hunt county raised for the sea- 1
son of 1895-96 in round numbers no,
24,ooo bales of cotton, which in p
their unnecessary rounds cost the int,
producers of this county the enor
mous sum of $4oo,ooo. Cut the
sum in half and allow Sto per bale Le
for shipping the manufactured arti
cle away and that leaves $24o,ooo. 2.3
Half this sum, or $5 per bale of
one year's crop would build a cot- t
ton factory in Hunt county that en
could turn into cloth every bale of
cotton in Hunt and adjoining coun- bo
ties. Such a mill would employ Cr
hundreds of men, and they and 36
their families would have to live ine
from the farm. With such condi- b
tions existing it does not require an ine
expert mathematician to figure out cen
wherte the farm's profit would come boa
in, and when the farmer prospers L
the balance of the country is safe. " cn
