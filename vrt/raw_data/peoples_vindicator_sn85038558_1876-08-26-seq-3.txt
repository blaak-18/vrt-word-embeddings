We, th'e representatives of the Demo
cratic-Conservative party of the State of
Louisiana, in convention assembled, do
hereby declare administrative and po.
litical reform to be the paramount issuE
in the coming general election, and we
earnestly appeal tqt our fellow-citizens oi
every former political association, white
and colored, to zealously co-operate with
us in our pronounced effourt to effect such
reform.
'rTII RADICAL PARtY.
We arraign the Radical party of Loll
isiana for mnaked and fre~etict viola
tions of the letter and spirit of the con
stitution; for -the assumption of illicit
powers for the benefit of the party, and
to the great injury .and almost total ruin
of the State; fior fomenting dissensions
between the races and deliberately ex
tuiitti strife and turmoil, thereby eruelly
Iacri'cing the lives of coloret and white
citizens, with the intent of penrocuring
n!warrantsd and and ncorntitutional inter
ference in our State affairs.
THr. USURPATroN.
We denounce the usurpative and bad
government which Louisiana has ntflered
for the last four years, a usurpation un
der which officers elected by the people
have been displaced, the government ar
bitrarily overthrown by Federal power,
the Legislature invaded and dispersed by
'bayonets in time of profound peace, and
such violent-and unlawful interference
adds but another to the long lists of crimie
for which the Republicanu arty should
be held to ac int in November next.
A IlrIr E.EcrTIOn.
We hereby proclaim that it is our de
sire and fixed purlpse, under any and
every provocation, to have a fair and
peaceable election; but we demand and
insist t th there shall be no violence or
intimidation exercised towards such of
our colored fellow-citizens as may wish
to Co-operate with nus for the redemption
of thu8tate from misrnle.
AMtENDrMENTrS TO Tll C,(ON)S'tTTIO%.
We fully recognize the Inditng effect
of the thipe recent articles of amend
ment to the Constitution of the Uidted
States, and, accept the same as a final
settlement of the controversies that en
gendered civil war, and we pledge our
selves to protect every citizen in the ex

teed by said amendments, whatever be
his race, co.or or previous condition.

THE PLATFORM.
Wn e, the delegates of the Democratic
pd arty of the lUnited States, in National
d Convention assRnlble,), do Iere declare
the adniiuistratlhn rf the Federal Gov
* eruntent to by in.iirgCnt need of inlimedi
ate refdim', dto bteriscy hjditi nlmn the
nominees of this Conventiion antl of the
SD)emocratic party in each State a zealous
f( eff rt and co-operation to this end, and
0 do hereby appeal to our fellow-citigens
,. of every former political connection to
e undertake with us this first and most
e pressing patriotic duty. For the Demo
,f cracy of the whole country we do hero
Sreaffirm our fiaith In the permanency of
h the Federal Union. Our devotion to the
h Constitution of the United States, with
its amendments ntiversally accepted as a
final settlement of the contrversies that
engendetred civil war, alid do here record
our steadfast confitence in the perpetuity
of Republican self-government; in abso.
lute acquiescence in the will of the ima
t. jority, the vital principlos of republics;
in the supremacy of the civil over the
a military authority; in the total supera
tion of Church and State for the sake
alike of civil and religious freedom ; In
Y the equality of all citizens before Just
0 laws of their own enactment;
IN THE LIBERTY
of individual conduct, unvexed by semp
tuary laws. In the faithful education of
the rising generation, that they may
preserve, enjoy and transmit these best
conditions of hnman happiness and hope.
we behold the noblest products of ahnu
de tred years of changefull history; but
while upholding the bond of our union,
and the great charter of these our rights,
it behooves a free people to practice also
that eternal vigilance which is the price
of liberty. Reform is necessary to re
build and establish in the hearts of the
whole people the union eleven years ago
happily rescued from the danger of a cor
rupt centra:llan Whiclh, after inflicting
- upon ten States the rapacity of
I CARPET-BAG TYRANNIES.
Has honey-combedl the officers of the
Federal Government itself with Incapaci
ty, waste and fraud, infected States and
municipalities with the contagion of mis
rule, and locked fast the prosperity of an
industrious people in the paralysis of
hard times. ltrm e necessary to es
t~lilish a sound cntrelcy, restore the
public credit, and maintaiu the national
honor. We denounce t,4e failure for all
I these eleven years to Cnake good the
I promise of the legal tender notes which
are a changing standard of v due in the
l hands of the people, and the non-pay
meat of which is a disregard of the
plighted faith of the nation. We de
nounce the improvidence which in eleven
years of peace has taken from the people
in Federal taxes thirteen times the whole
amount of the legal tender notes, and
squandered fonur times this sum in use
less expense without accumulating any
reserve for their redemption. We de- I
nounco the financial imbecility and ini
morality of that. party which, during
eleven years of peace has made no ad
vance toward resumption ; that instead,
has obstructed resumption by wasting t
our resources and exhausting all our sur
plus income, and while annually profea
sing to intend
A SPEEDY RETURN TO SPECIE
PAYMENTS
has annually n;,actedl fresh hindrances
thereto, as sech' a himndlranee we de
nounce the resumption clause of 4he ast
of 187, and we cre idemalnd' its repeal.
We dcmaund ta jlicious system of pre
paration by publicJ economies, by official
retrenchmens and by wise finance whilch
shall enahlel the natiou to insure the
whole world of its perfict ability and its
perfect readiness to meet any of its prom
ises at the call of the creditor .entitled to
payment. We believe such a system,
well devised and above all entrusted to
competent hands for execution, creating
at no time an artificial scarcity of cur
rency and at no time alarming the pub
lie nlind into a withdrawal of that vas
ternmachinery ofe credit by which ninety
five per ent: of all bunslues transactions
are performed, a system open, public and
inspiring general confidence would from
the day of its adoption

to all our harrassed industry'and set in
motion the wheels of commerce, mann I
facturea aid the mechanical arte, restore a
employment to labor and renew in all its 5
national source the prosperity of the
people. Reform is necessary in the sum
and mode of Federal taxation to the end I
that cpital may he qet free frontom distress I
and labor lightly burdened. We de
nounce the present tariff levied upon
nearly fourn thoe sand articlesas a master
piecy of IgnJstlee, inequality and false
lreteuse; it yields a awind!ing,, sot a
yearly risineg reveinue; itas impovrerish
ed nlanny industries to Aubsidise a few;
it prohildits imports that might purehse

it has ectt down the sales of

In Here again professions falsified in the

power can work no practical or salutary
reform. Reform is necessary even more
in .the higher grades of public service.

ALL THIESE AIUSES,
wrongs and crimes, the product of six
teen years of ascendancy of the Republi
can party, create a necessity for reform
ccnfessed by the Republicans themselves.
int these reformers are voted down in
convention and displaced from the Cabi
net. The party's mass of hot(at votes is
powerliss to resist the eighty thousand
office holders, its leaders and guides. Re
form can only he had by a peacefui civic
revolution. We demand a change of
system, a change of ad:inistmation, a
chanlge of parties, that we may have a
change of nmen,.
