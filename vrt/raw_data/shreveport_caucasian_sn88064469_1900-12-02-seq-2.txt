the United States, will be required.
The canal commission is making a
strenuous effort to finish its preliminary
report which will be sent to congress as
an accompanimentt of the president's
message and that in the meanwhile it
will probably not be made public.
It is evidently the intention of tLe ad.

It is expeoted that before final action

hal published a statement relative to
the liquor traffo of Manila. It shows
that the American authorities have in
reased the license fee from $4 for each
saloon to $00 for saloons of the iArst
class; 50 for those of the second clae.;
$10o0 for the third clan. and $50 for the
last clan, selling only beer and light
whxm and located outside of the hbusiness
district. The Dale of the native drink
"vino" has been forbidden to soldiers
as It is most harmful in its effects upon
them.
There were only 155 licenses outstand
ng a Jane 80, last, a decrease of 6O
mlace the Americans licenses began.
The barrooms are more orderly and
keepers more careful in sales to drunken
persoas and in observing the opening
and closinag hours. No disobharged
Amerlean soldier holds a license. The
Spealards hold e6 licenses; Americans

i Later In the day the popular orator
addressed an audience which filled to

Latta-Am.erAeas and Pam-Amerleam.
The press of the various countries of
Latin-America show a cordial interest
in the Pan-American Exposition. It is
recognised that their co-operation is es
sential to the end that the Exposition
may adequately represent the progress
of all the states and countries of this
hemisphere. As a rule the editors of
newspapers and other publications in
the countries to the south of the United
Stares display a very favorable atti
tude toward the enterprise. B. B. Lo
pea, editor and proprietor of La Corre
spondencia de Porto Blco. has become
so enthusiastle over the Exposition
that he writes to the Press Department
that be is about to come to Buffalo to
see for himself the progrbss made in
the development of the Exposition. He
will be accompanied by his family.
Many other editors of the Latin-Ameri
can press have also announced their In
tention to attend the Exposition. and
inquiries are pouring in from these
cou:atries regarding steamboat and rail
road router. Many editors and corre
spondents from Central and South
American countries have already vis
itted the Exposition grounds.

play on a scale never before attempted:
To show this interesting collection to
the best advantage an attractive con
servatory has been provided. while a
museum, as an annex to this, will con
tain finished products as well as rare
and curious articles to illustrate a va
rlety of features under the head of
'Foods and Their Accessories.'
"It is a fact well known to experts
in %xhibltion matters that a scattered
display of special articles loses force.
while a condensed exhibit of a line of
things pertaining to a specific subject
becomes educational. Now, as the ob
ject is to increase the production and
promote the consumption of the things
called for. much trouble and expense
is justified in making this collection
unique and unparalleled.
"It is intended to make the exhibit
of red peppers the finest and most ex
tensi% collection ever tllmale. with the
object of demonstratin byI special ex
iblbit connectetd with the 'accessories
of food' that Pan-America can pro
duce all the red peppers consumed in
Pan-America. It is perhaps only known
to experts that vast quantitlies of red
peppers are imported from Europe,
Asia and Africa every year because
Pan-Americans are not actively alive
to their own Interest in this important
matter."

Joe Mitchell Cihnpplet. edito" of The

came much interested in the Exposti

to an officig of the Exposition as fol
lows: "I was indeed sorry not to have
seen you when in iluf'alo. but I did see
I the Exposition and was astonishld be
y yond measure. I wish that you would
send on anything that you think night
be of interest to our readers and make
it as attractive as possible. and I shall
keep on hamminering away at the Expo-,
sition editorially until it opens. because
I ;m thoroughly enthused over the
subject."
Brasil to Be Represented.
The Brazilian government early in
the season sent out invitations to all
agricultural and industrial societies to
prepare articles for exhibition at the
Pan-American Exposition at Buffa'o in
1901. A large number of coffee pro
Sducers have agreed to send a full line
Sof samples of the best Brazilian grades
of this commodity.
