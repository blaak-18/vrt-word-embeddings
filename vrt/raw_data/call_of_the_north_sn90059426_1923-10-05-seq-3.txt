SHERBURN (MINN.) EDITOR COMES BACK
In copying an article from the Ad
vance-Standard of recent date rela
tive to the Ku Klux Klan the Fair
mont Independent, presumably, we
hope, groping for more light on a
movement that has been greatly mis
represented by a great share of the
press (which claims to be independent
but which, unfortunately, is not) asks
some questions which we are going
to touch on only briefly:
“Under the Constitution,” the In
dependent asks, is a Protestant given
preference over Catholic or Jew?”
This question is vague and am
biguous. If we are correctly in
formed—and we think we are—the
United States is only fifteen per cent
Catholic and yet 65 per cent of the
public and political offices of the na
tion are controlled by Catholics. Un
der the circumstances, why does the
Independent ask such a misleading
question? The late President Hard
ing was a Klansman, but we don’t re
call that he as a Protestant asked or
demanded any preferences over Cath
olics.
“Who is afraid?” is question num
ber two.
The bootleggers, the blindpiggers,
the wife beaters, the law-breakers,
the tin horn sports who have no re
spect for virtue, the crooked politi
cians—these fellows are afraid. If
there are any others, claiming to be
American citizens, who are afraid of
the Klan, we don’t know why unless it
is that they are afraid of their own
shadow.
Question number three: “Must the
Protestant Press support the Klan in
order to take an uncompromising
stand for pure and undefiled Ameri
canism?”
Most certainly. And just as long
as the Klan stands on such sacred
ground the Advance-Standard will
support it. Is there one single soli
tary reason why the American Press
should not?
“What is the insignia of the Klan?”
asks the Independent in question four.
The fiery cross. Haven’t you seen
it?
“Is there a Klan organization in
Martin county?” Question five. Ac
cording to news articles in that very
paper within the past few weeks
there surely is. Why ask?
Oh, yes “If one, why all this se
crecy?”
The Klan has no secrets outside
its membership. The Klan is not a
society of lodge. It is a movement,
and that movement stands four
square for the Bible, the American
schools, freedom of the press, the di
vorcement of insidious religious or po
litical influence or dictation from Eu
ropean monarchs or potentates, for
clean manhood and womanhood and
for the Stars and Stripes as the em
blem of the free and the home of the
brave.
“Does the Klan believe in taking
the law into its own hands?” Ques
tion six.
Not at all. Those who peddle that
sort of bunk are the same fellows
who are peddling the bunk about
night riders, cut throats, drowning
artists and other bogy stuff that
comes in the same category with Dad
dy’s Good Night Stories and other
fairy tales. No one is taken into the
Klan who does not take an oath to
stand by the Constitution and to up
hold the laws of the land. The move
ment is based on the secret service
plan. There’s where the secret part
of it comes in; but this secrecy is
necessary to the exercise of duties
that fall upon the members as cham
pions of law and order.
“Why not let the peace officers
themselves enforce the laws?” Ques
tion seven.
Why not, indeed?
As a matter of fact the average
peace officers these days are helpless

to enforce the laws against the great
horde of men who appear to have
lost all respect for both their country
and its laws. Shifty and crooked
politicians control our politics and in
only too many instances they pick
their own officers in order to secure
immunity from just punishment.
Poor peace officers! If anybody need
ed help they surely do And how
could the Klan help the peace officers
and other law-abiding citizens if they
had no better sense than to go about
its service with a brass band and
colored posters.
“Why do night riders go masked?”
Question eight.
We shall combine number eight
with number nine which asks “Why
carry concealed weapons?” Both
questions merely show a state of
mind that naturally results from the
multiplicity of press lying and wilful
misrepresentation that has been
spread by people who either do not
know what they are talking about
or else do not care. The harrowing
tale of the two men who were sup
posed to be drowned in a lake down
in Louisiana a few months is a fitting
monument to that kind of lying. The
Klan was blamed for the crime and
after the agony of a long-drawn out
trial the two men who were supposed
to be dead appeared—heads and all—
and then the Press shut up like a
clam with the result that a lot of
good innocent people still believe the
Klan did it.
The final question the Independent
puts is this:
“Why all this fuss?”
That’s it exactly. That question
is right to the point. Who is mak
ing all this fuss about the Klan?
And why is it being made? The
more we contemplate that question
the more significent it becomes. Why
all this fuss over the Klan ? Why all
this deliberate, malicious, uncalled
for, un-Christian slander of red-blood
ed American men and women who
fare enlisting in a movement that
stands for the very best and highest
type of citizenship under God and Old
Glory?
In name of God will some one
or more who appear to be so concern
ed about the Klan answer that ques
tion.
Unless they are able to and willing
to, let them forever keep their peace.

IMMIGRANT QUOTAS
ARE NOT REDUCED
Only slight changes from the allot
ments of the last year are shown in
regulations promulgated today by the
labor department fixing the number
of immigrants of the various na
tionalities who will be admitted to
the United States under the quota
law during the fiscal year beginning
July 1. The allotment for the United
Kingdom of Great Britain t and Ire
land remains at 77,342, that* for Ger
many again is 67,607, and that for
Italy is unchanged at 42,057.
Poland’s quota is increased from
21,076 to 30,977 through the inclusion
of the Pinsk region in white Russia
and eastern Galicia. The Russian
quota is increased to 24,405 from
21,613, Bessarabia now being merged
in the total. The French quota re
mains unchanged at 5,729.
Austria loses 109, its quota being
reduced from 7,451 to 7,342, while
Hungary’s quota is increased 109
from the 5,638 fixed for the present
year. Turkey shows the greatest
gain, as a result of the Turco-Greek
war. She gets 266 more than the
2,388 allotted this year, while Greece
loses 231, making her total for the
coming year 3,063.

THE CALL OF THE NORTH
UNRECOGNIZED
There ia an old picture of a scene in
some city of the Orient, where a
beggar sits beside a sunny wall. In
tattered garb he has stationed him
self in this, his acustomed place, to
ask for alms. With cup outreached
to attract attention, and head leaned
comfortably back against the wall,
he sleeps while he waits. A benevo
lent passer-by thinks to give the
sleeper a happy surprise by a rich
gift. But a second pedestrian, catch
ing a glint of the gold removes the
coin quietly and goes also on his
way. “He cannot lose what he
knows not he had,” argues the thief,
in the bit of verse which explains the
picture. So the beggar sleeps on,
unconscious alike of gain or loss,
awakening at last to grumble over
another poor day.
This is a picture of a beggar by an
ancient wall, but it is also a picture
of life and its wasted opportunities.
In the educational advantages that
are offered us, in the close relation
ships of our homes, in all our com
ings and goings among the people
about ug, golden coins of opportunity
for usefulness are offered us, and
we do not see or appreciate them un
til Delay “or Ignorance has stolen
away what Time so graciously be
stowed. Many a person who grumbles
over a hard life does not know that
he slept while a treasure which wouLI
have enriched him lay unnoticed with
in his grasp.
The Orient furnishes another fade
less picture—that of a well, and be
side it a Traveler. Out from a city
gate came a woman to draw water
as she had done countless times be
fore. It was the same old well, the
same old task, the same old house
hold drudgery that drove her to it.
The traveler saw opportunity to help,
but at first the woman saw nothing
beyond the common event of a com
mon day. Perhaps she realized at
the moment no need beyond the
thirst which had brought each to the
well, but the Master offered her a
priceless treasure—the water of life
everlasting. “If thou knowest the
gift of God,” he said. If she had but
known, she would have asked and he
would have given, but she talked of
differences of race and petty preju
dices.
There is no greater moment in any
life than that which it meets Christ,
but like that of the woman of Samar
ia, many a soul only argues and
questions and does not understand.
If one talks to such of the Bible they
speculate idly as to how the sacred
writings were first gathered and
combined, and which parts are real
ly historical and which are allegoric
al. If they are invited to accept the
offer of salvation, they only discuss
creeds and sects—whether in “this
mountain,” or “at Jerusalem” is the
proper place of worship—and fancy
that they are waiting for further en
lightenment.
Doubt may be sincere, but if it
recognizes the importance of its
questioning it does not merely dally
in uncertainty. It is recorded of two
atheists, men of high social and in
tellectual rank, that they planned to
attack the Christian religion in their
writings, but first they very wisely
decided to study from all points the
two Gospel narratives they sought to
disprove—the resurrection of Christ
and the conversion of Saul of Tarsus.
They met at the end of the appointed
time, but both of them had become
convinced that Christ did rise from
the dead, and was the Savior of the
world. Both these men found them
selves face to face with a living Lord
at the end of their research. They
had come unwittingly upon life’s
greatest discovery. Many an offered
gain and blessing we let slip from out
our years by our sloth or blindness,
but life’s greatest opportunity—the
meeting of the Master and his offer
of eternal blessedness —is denied to
you.—Exchange.

THREATS DON'T DAUNT
MONTANA KLANSMEN
Despite anonymous letters received
by officers of Lewiston Klan Number
8, Realm of Montana, which declared
that they would be killed if they at
tempted to hold any public naturaliza
tion ceremony, the greatest meeting
of Klansmen ever held in Montana
was staged at Lewiston last week.
Announcement of the meeting was
made public a couple of weeks ago
and the threats started to pour in.
It was openly stated by several boot
leggers and gamblers that the Klan
meeting would be assaulted and
broken up should it be held.
However, no attempt at violence
was made when three thousand Klans
men gathered on the top of a hill
ten miles west of the city and initiat
ed 282 aliens into Lewiston Klan
while fifteen thousand spectators
looked on.
The element opposed to the Klan
stood on the outside of the meeting
using vile language and cursing the
organization. Beyond this there was
no trouble. The great crowd was
served refreshments by Lewiston Klan
at the conclusion of the ceremonial
and fireworks display.

Constitution ? Constitution ? Oh,
y-e-s-s; yes. Guess we really have a
constitution, haven’t we?
Daily Oklahoman.
“TIMES” HATH SAID
Gov. Walton, of Oklahoma, has been
occupying the scaije heads of the
newspapers lately. This may be a
personal gratification to the gover
nor. It is a pretty safe prediction,
however, that he will not find this no
toriety either pleasant or profitable.
It matters not what opinions may be
held of the Ku Klux Klan. That issue
is lost in the action of the Governor
in attempting to create a dictator
ship over the state, for there can be
no other interpretation of his action.
The people are more interested in
maintaining constitutional, represen
tative government than they are in
the Klans or the governor. There is
no evidence to indicate that there
were any disturbances created by the
“Invisible Empire,” even conceding all
the charges to be true, which could
not have been handled by the local
authorities. If they were not able to
take care of the situation, or not dis
posed to do so, then the state might,
and should step in and take charge
in that particular locality until the
local authorities were disposed to do
the work themselves. To establish
marshal law over a whole state, and
submit the people to privations and
censorships because of a few local
disturbances, is a high handed pro
ceedure that the American people
will not stand for, and we think
Governor Walton will find that out
before he is through with his pres
ent program. Influences that are sub
versive of the government should be
tamped out, whether they be Klans
or what not, but the people are not
much benefitted if one Klan is dis
persed and another arises out of the
means used to accomplish that result.
Gov. Walton will find out that force
is a dangerous weapon to attempt to
use on a free people, and that they
will not stand for it very long.—The

“I LEARNED ABOUT MOTHERS
FROM HER”
WM.. L. STIDGER.
A woman burned red as the sunset,
And weathered her face as an
oak;
A tiny papoose in her shoulder,
A blanket of fur for a cloak:
But a smile on her face and a light
in her eyes,
Like the kiss of the sun when the day
time dies.
Ah, the laughter of love at her baby’s
dear cries!
Then into my eyes crept a mist and
a blur,
As I learned about MOTHERS
from her.
The city was panting its lfe out,
As it sweltered beneath the hot
sun;
A poor Hebrew girl of the Ghetto
Was nursing her little one:
And she yearned on him there with
a look of despair;
Praying God for some comfort, some
hope in his care:
Praying God for a cooling of rain in
the air.
Then a light in her eyes as she saw
her babe stir
Made me learn about MOTHERS
from her!
Another I saw; on outcast she was:
A woman despised, with a babe
on her breast.
I saw her at eve as she sang it to
sleep,
While the kiss of the twilight
was deep on the West.
And I watched her face there, so
young and so fair,
And I heard her sweet croon drifting
out on the air;
And I saw the dear touch of her lips
on his hair.
“The Harlot,” they flung at her
home with a slur;
But v I learttfed about MOTHERS
from her!
A memory day slips out of the
years:
A woman of gray: Ah, why
falleth these tears?
My own, it was she who gave me
my life
Out of death and of darkness and
strife:
A hundred sweet twilights are throng
ing me now,
And thousands of “good-nights” are
kissing my brow,
While my head and my soul in sweet
homage I bow,
And her form and her face floats
out of the blur,
For I learned about MOTHERS
from her!—Ex.

“Is there a Christian flea?”

EDUCATION AND HAPPINESS
By J. SHERMAN
Education is the preparation of an
individual to meet and to master
his environment. Of course it will
help a man to make a living, but its
supreme purpose is to enable him to
make a life. When Aristotle was
asked how the educated man differed
from the uneducated, he answered:
“As the living differ from the
dead.” If one is never to be known
outside his own community he
ought to be educated, for it is only
thus that he is equipped for a hap
py private life. Four years in col
lege will enlarge a man’s horizon
and reveal to him new worlds. It
will give an added richness and beau
ty to life. It will help him to know
the world in which he lives. The real
purpose of education is not to cram
the memory with facts, but be equip
the whole man to fulfil the purposes
for which he was created; not to make
the world, life, character, and service
seem greater to us.
If education consisted only in the
accumulation of facts, the material
for a liberal education could be se
cured for twenty-five cents in the
“World Almanac.” The real purpose
of the college is to train the mind
to think. It is an intellectual gymna
sium. “Knowledge is power,” but a
disciplined mind is of more value
than knowledge. The facts one learns
in college are not so important as the
control of his own mind which is ac
quired while he is learning them.
What he learns may soon be forgot
ten, but the power of learning can
never be taken from him. The
trained mind will always know where
and how to get specific information
that it needs.
Education gives one the power of
attention. The best course of study
are those which train the mind to
concentrate and hold its attention
upon an object until it glows with
light and interest; the power to mar
shal all the forces of the mind and
march them together to conquest and
victory. To be able to sit down and
focus attention upon one problem un
till it is thought through is a satis
faction that belongs only to the edu
cated mind. The man who can do
this will get what he wants, for the
world will always turn aside to let
the man pass who knows where he
is going.
Education gives one the power of
observation and appreciation. The
mind sees only that which it has
the power of seeing and enjoys only
that which it makes a part of itself.
The little child cannot comprehend
the things that are around it, for it
has nothing with which to compare
them. A company of Eskimo walked
through the streets of London unat
tracted by anything they saw or
heard. Everything was so absolutely
strange that it had no interest for
them. One man will travel around
the world and see nothig but crowds.
SPURGEON, FORMERLY
MINNESOTA KING
KLEAGLE, IN MISSOURI
That the Rev. O. L. Spurgeon, pas
tor of the First Baptist church, who
has resigned from that pulpit and will
relinquish the work after the conven
tion of the State Baptist association,
has been called to the post of Exalted
Cyclops of Poplar Bluff Klan No. 48,
Realm of Missouri, Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, at a salary of $5,000 a
year, was announced today.
Spurgeon too, confirmed the an
nouncement, saying that he had an-
the call and would be in
charge of the local organization.
In speaking of accepting this call
he said he felt he had taken up the
work of offering bigger opportunity
than any church in the community
could. “As the leader of eight hun
dred men in a fight for civic right
eousness and a 100 per cent Ameri
canism there is real opportunity for
Christian service.”
The Rev. Spurgeon, who is a na
tionally known lecturer, has been lec
turing for many months throughout
Missouri and Arkansas and during
the month of August was in the state
of Tennessee. This he will continue
to do as well as to occupy pulpits.
He will also be subject to the call of
the Atlanta national headquarters of
the K. K. K. in the national field of
lecturing.
The Rev. Mr. Spurgeon states a
committee is now at work on plans
for the erection of a large log cabin
klavem which will be finished in mis
sion fashion and in which will be
found two large fire places. It will
be built in chapel style. On Sunday
there will be religious services and a
Bible class at fixed hours in the day.
It was announced the Klan program
will also call for some outside serv
ices in its general program for civic
righteousness.
The Klan owns a forty-acre tract
of land on the St. Louis road, where
a picturesque open air Klavern has
been arranged in a valley with a nat
ural ampitheatre overlooking it. The
Klan has put in a Delco light plant
for the illumination of the grounds
and it will serve in providing this con
venience for the new building.
WALLACE, A. M.
Another will make a six-months’ trip
to a new land and write volumes upon
the things that he saw. One man sees
only a narrow circle of things not
much wider than the circle seen by
the ox. He may live a contented life,
but it is the contentment of the ox
that chews its cud and knows nothing
beyond this. The circle of the edu
cated man’s thinking is the outermost
rim of the heavens and his thought
pierces the burning core of the earth.
The degree of a man’s education may
be measured by the width and depth
and delicacy of his appreciation. It
is this that measures one’s wealth
and makes him rich or poor. The
world within is the real world; the
w'orld without takes all its color, all
its beauty, all its value from that.
What though the hands must toil
when the heart can sing ? What
though the body lives in a cottage
when the soul dwells in mansions?
What though others hold the title
deeds? We can own the universe if
we have room enough for it within.
Education puts a man into fellow
ship with all the ages. It enables
him to listen intelligently while all *
the poets and the prophets and the
sages of the centuries talk to him.
It multiplies his life in his own gen
eration. It makes him at home
among any class of men. “A man
with limited education is in touch
with life in a few points. Wide edu
cation brings contact with life at
many points.” It makes a man
manysided. He will live more in a
day than an ignorant man can live
in a century.
One of the chief values of an edu
cation is that it enables a man to be
so much better company to himself.
The trained mind can never be lone
some. Not only is the wisdom of the
ages at his side to cheer him, but his
own thoughts are interesting. Never
can he want something to hear while
there is a bird song in the tree tops
or the music of the brook on the hill
side. Never can he want conversa
tion while the spirits of the millions
of the past and present dwell wnthin
his mind.
Rarely indeed has a man who has
graduated from college regretted the
time or the toil or the sacrifice. It
is impossible to compare life and its
value at the end of the college course
with life and its meaning when the
college course was begun. “The mer
ehadise of it is better than the mer
chandise of silver, and the gain there
of than fine gold.” The savage is
satisfied with his hunting ground be
cause he knows no lands beyond. But
the happiness of the truly educated
man is as far above that of the sav
age as the noonday sun is above the
will-o’-the-wisp. To the thoughtless,
sordid world these two men might
appear equally happy, but how does
the world appear to these two men?
—Young People.
SMILES
The Rev. James Converse was for
thirty-seven years minister of the
church in Weathersfield, Vt., going
there soon after his graduation from
Harvard and remaining until he died,
pastor, counselor, leader in affairs
spiritual and political. His skill in
settling troubles is shown in the
story of his dealing with the choir,
which, because of some difference
with the minister, had gone on strike.
The choir announced that it would
take its place in the choirloft on Sun
day morning, but would not sing.
The church was crowded by those who
wanted to witness the pastor’s deal
ing with the situation. Mr. Converse,
for the first hymn, announced “We
will now sing ‘St. Thomas’—
“ ‘Come, we who love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.
“We will begin with the second
verse—
“ ‘Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew their God;;
But children of the heavenly King.
May speak their joys abroad.’ ”
The choir capitulated and sang with
fervor.—Christian Register.

cently the telegram he sent Theodore
Roosevelt assistant secretary of the
navy, replying to a speech Mr. Roose
velt made last wees, at Syracuse at
the New York state fair.
“The press reports say that you
stated at the New York state fair
that farmers could not trust the gov
ernment to manage the handling of
farm products because politics would
creep in and spoil it. Are you con
fessing the truth about the Repub
licans or indicting the Democrats?
“You are also quoted as saying
that mentally limited fanatics are
urging government price fixing of
farm products. The voters of sev
eral million farm families favor this.
“Who appointed you to a country
life commission?
“Half a million face the loss of
their farms and their life savings,
and not all of them can be appointed
to near-cabinet positions at lucrative
salaries.’’
