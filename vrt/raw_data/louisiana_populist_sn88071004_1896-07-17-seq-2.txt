This independence of action and n

most entirely to the efforts of the I a

WANTEII)-Bids for the city
printing. The 'highest bidder takes
it. This is about the way the iid
should have read, for the printing
went to the 30)c. per square hid of
the Enterprise, while the Populist I
bid was 1:3c. lower, or 1i;3 cents
per square. That's economy on the
same principle that was practiced
by a man who dropped a maeth in (
the dark. He lit four to find the t
one. Public interest is always sac
rificed to private greed, antd this I
printing contract is no exception
to the general rule.
Hon. B. W. Marston of Red
River parish, one of the delegates
to the Democratic convention at
Chicago, created no little fun for t
the crowd. He succeeded in drink
ing half a dozen glasses of ice wa
ter in trying to make a short speech, &
amlnd finally succeed in nominating I
McLean for Vice-president several I
days later. A notable feature of
his second appearance was when g
he was recogniz7ie by the chair, a
the pitcher of ice water was re
moved from within reach of "the
scarlet-headed cuss of the jungles .
of Ccushatta," as a Chicago paper
calls him. At any rate, the Hon.
B. W. was the fun maker of the
convention, and sueceeded in hav
ing his say.
When Ananias lied the Lordl
knocked him dead. Fortunately
for professional politicians this
practice is not in vogue. If it was,
you could'at get a Democratic
speaker to address an audience
with a sheriff. A man will take
chances on being punished hereaf
ter for prevaricating, but when he
knows he will be knocked out at
once for lieing, he is apt to tell the
truth or keep his mouth shut.
Remember that the City Co:nm
cil makes you pay 1:3k cents more
for each inch of public printing. u
