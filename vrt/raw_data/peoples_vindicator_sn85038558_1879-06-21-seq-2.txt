And now we have hald all tihe
speeches, both pro and con, upon the
debt question. We have had them
of all grade from the solid, legsl
or. statement to the frothby fury of sn
Stimneni.
And what has it all amounted to ?
Has any thing been suggested which
will lead to a practical solution of the
bat qnweon, for that is the goal to which
W'e emat treeb at last.
We vetetole assertion that not
a line of these deelamatlon can be
s distorted late a real praeleal sigges
lon for the settlement o the debt.
mil After all, however, we havr new
P retarned to reason; and after this
In. egervescenee of words the statenmen
late of Louisian mast come to consider
'r. the plain propositions of the New
hat Orleans Drmocrat and the VNIDIcA
the iron, that the question at Wis was
ao- not one of law, but was purely po
cal litical; to be settled in equity to
iel wards both the creditor and the peo.
be ple.
Louisiana can never'afford to repo
lid diate; her people mast have relief
:tly from the ruinous burdens of taxation
SItnow imposed upon them. It makes
the no difference praetirally; how that
the relIef comes, whether in an amicable
ec- adjustment of the debt, or by a re.
sBt duetllo of Interest even to two per
sit. cent for a period, and an *.,r'snee un
til a maanimam of 4 per cent is reach.

on The people are prepared to endorse
ret any honorable adjustment, and they
sat ely with confidence upon the men
If* of judgment in the Cotvention to
"il saute that adjustment at all basards.

the appears the followieg:

I heard Dr. Pnroggs way that the yellow

Dr. T. 0. Richardsol O.an of the Msa1
lesl Department of the Unsversity of
icl Louisiana, says :
e aam quite rare that Dr. SerngP, in

Ie4UUU for Iselu. r Dsuslnthweat7
In Sam u _a NI n ,h altD, as

her this aasron; at juging by the
his tSt hesth reports f avaa, Vera

think that we shall continne to enjoy our
ew present immunity from epidemic diseases.
DA- Br. D. C. eolilay.
res Dr. SrEggs's recent visit to New Or
-loea must have proved to Dr. 8. how
wholly untrue any report of the exis
lo- tense of yellow fever. There is no yelt.
p. low fever here now, nor has there been a
case for the past three months.
Dr. . Stilles.
' I hereby certify, that in my opinion
lef there has been no ease of yellow fever
on in the city this year. Upon diligent
inquiry I cannot bear of a single eane.
Ite The city i annunally healthy for this
lat season of the year.
le Dr. F. Lter
I have not seen a case of yellow fever,
re nor have I been i.furmaonel of a ease of
er ,rollw fever. except onu case brought by
in. the lteamer Baltimore in the month of
March.
Dr. Geao. . Pratt, Charity Hespital.
I eertify that I have neither heard of
roe nor seen any cases of yellow fever in
ey this city during the present season.
Mr. Booth then offered the following,
en whichb was uanimously adoptedl:
to Whereas, it havingthome to the knowl
s edge of the Board of Health that a ri.
mor is said to have prevailed at Alexan. I
dria, La., that yellow fever was and is
in New Orleans this season; I
Therefore tle Board sassures the pee
of pie of this State antd lonlgeons States,
that such rumers are without founda. I
tion in fact and that, with the excep
tion of one strictly delined and well -
known imported ease (recovered,, per s
stesanship Baltimore in thse myth of
March, there has been no yellow (ever I
in this city during the present yegr. ,I
The board make this declaration with 1
the more conaldene in its acceptance by
.)the people exterior to the city itself, in '
that it is bound amler pledge to make t
ue known the prsence of fever in New Or. I
tie leans for the lnformation of all whom it $
is may concera sald our fellow-eitiseas
no may depend upon seeing that pledge

I- tIon vallei recently Are evidently of
if the tinta llvariety Is thlee which dlr
nlog the past few years have been do.e
SI vatating the crlps of the farmers of
° the Middle and Western States, and
a doubtless came from Sierra valley,
" which dating the past few months
I has been a sort of nursery for these
a pests. Whe. they reached Carson
Ir they aseld an excitement among the
inhablltants of the capital second only
* to the c,,Aeaoin of the Legislatere
d last winter. It was expected that
a they would Immediately fall to work
. upon the verdnre of tile valley, and
o people began to put their flowers in
ir lister overcoate ; but the issects sim-.
m. ply walked about tihe town on a tour
of inspection, and declined to lay
their mnanidilles upon anything. They
wr were evidently freshll in tie country,
i. nld seemed determined to rore shout
I. for a few days ansd select the deli.
a cacies which that section affrds. In
a few I-ullt.u, however, they caume in
and destroyed rsoele geraniunm plants.
n They simply bite thie rtenm of the
!r leaves at their junction with the stalk,
it allowing tie leaves to fall. They
* then took a nip from the nmot tender
* portion of the leaf, and walked out
into the street again to hunllt for a
change of diet or a fresh house. The
r, cllancs are that when the stock of
Sgeramniums s are h exhaunted they will
SbImegin to eat more comllmon varieties i
of vegetahle fond. The grasshopper
as a rule prefers tihe bhet there is in
the nssket, but when circlumstances
f are against blims and tile larder is low
le will contenlt his stosemac with the
splinters of a f'tnce-.ril or a diedl
plke weedi stalk. When tihe train
I pent down flon this eity on Santu-.
. day afteri.mon it passsed through a
* about a tmile of grasshoppers match. i
Siag pil toward the COnmstllck. The
lmnmects itee met just below the
Mound Houmpe, and were evidently
nmaking that place a point of attack.
When they reach the Coistelmck they
will Ibe warmly welcomed. The
r sage-brush on the hills about this
rf itv is not a very inviting diet to set
l befole a guest, but, like the turnip
,dinner set ,out by Col. Mulherry Sri
Slers, it is the best we have, and migh

the air is white with them. As they
stand on the ground they' are sasnt
"he edor of the asoil and can hardly
be seen, but in flying they expose
then bellies and the under part of (
their wings, which are white. It is h
supposed that they left California on
