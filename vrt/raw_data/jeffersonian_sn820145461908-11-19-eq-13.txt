The Ad Man’s Galley
By fames Lanier.
Next month and January a large
proportion of subscribers to maga
zines and papers of all kinds will re
new their subscriptions for the com
ing year, and we want to call the at
tention of our subscribers to the fact
that we have the best possible club
bing arrangements with practically
every magazine and paper of import
ance published in the United States.
If you wish to buy your periodicals,
including the Jeffersonians, at bar
gain prices, send us your order. If
you don’t find on our list the publica
tion that you want to subscribe for,
drop us a postal card, and we will
give you full information.
A very attractive offer, which ap
peals to all sides of the household,
is that of the Delineator (the monthly
fashion review), the World’s Work
(excellent for its articles and reviews
of social interest), and the Jefferson
ian Magazine. The total value of
these three subscriptions is $5.50, and
we offer them for three dollars. If
you wish to substitute Everybody’s
Magazine for the World’s Work, the
price will be $3.25, and you will have
a combination that is hard to beat.
You can save a dollar by clubbing
the Review of Reviews and the Jef
fersonian Magazine for $3.50. Add
fifty cents a year to any of the above
offers and we will send you the
Weekly Jeffersonian.
There is no more acceptable Christ
mas present than a subscription to
some well known publication. For the
kids we offer the Youth’s Companion
or Cassell’s Little Folks at very low
rates in connection with the Jeffer
sonians, and for the ladies we have
the best proposition of all. The Pic
torial Review (an up-to-date fashion
journal), Modern Priscilla (the recog
nized leading fancy work magazine of
America), and the Ladies’ World
(the foremost household monthly), to
gether with the two Jeffersonians and
a Pictorial Review dress pattern, can
be had for $2.50 per year. In other
words, a husband who is a subscrib
er to the Jeffersonians and wishes to
renew his subscription, can add fifty
cents to the amount and make his
wife a present of three yearly sub
scriptions to the best fashion and
household magazines and can also
send her a dress pattern of which she
will be proud.
The Weekly Jeffersonian has club
bing arrangements with all daily and
weekly papers of importance, and par
ticularly with the farm journals and
people ’s papers, such as the Missouri
World, the Farmers’ Union News,
Farm and Ranch, the Virginia Farm
er, the Texas Farmer, the National
Co-operator, the Ohio Liberty Bell,
the People’s Voice (Oklahoma), etc.
By renewing your subscription to
both papers whenever one runs out,
you can save money.
Here are some figures to ponder ov
er. They were collected by the Chi
cago Record-Herald. The annual cir
culation of the newspapers of the
world is estimated to be twelve thou
sand million copies, which would cov
er 10,450 square miles of surface.
75l>e "Jeffersonian
They are printed on 781,250 tons of
paper, and the process of counting
them, at the rate of one a second,
working day and night, would take
333 years. Piled vertically, they
would reach to a height of 500 miles;
and, calculating that the average man
spends five minutes of each day in
reading his paper (a very low esti
mate), we find that the people of the
world annually consume in the read
ing of their papers an amount of time
equivalent to 100,000 years.
A word to our advertisers. Nine
out of every ten customers in the
larger stores ask for the advertised
brands of staple goods. They want
the commodities they have read about
in advertisements. They ask for them
by name, and they insist upon having
them because the advertising has
created confidence. Advertising is an
investment, and not a venture, if in
telligently done. Consider the vast
amount of money being expended for
publicity by the shrewdest merchants
in the country. Isn’t it likely that if
advertising were unprofitable, they
would have found it out before now?
Advertising must be continuous as
well as attractive. It’s the everlast
ingly 11 at it” that counts.
“One step won’t take you very far;
You’ve got to keep on walking.
One little ad won’t do it all;
You’ve got to keep on talking.
For if you stop a minute
A-tootin ’ of your horn,
Not a critter in the town
Will remember you were born.”
At the last analysis the most suc
cessful advertisement is the one that
is perfectly and simply honest. Ad
vertising is not exaggeration, or clever
ideas, or schemes, or mystery. It is
just common sense, applied honestly
to fit particular cases. The advertise
ments that most appeal to the public
are those which somehow make a man
feel that they tell the simple truth,
and that only.
Never a day passes that does not
bring its word of encouragement. Mr.
W. H. Westmoreland, of Canon, Ga.,
writes: “In response to your re
quest I send you two subscriptions,
instead of one. Wish I could send
you two hundred instead of the two.”
Mr. W. N. Jones, of LaGrange, Ga.,
also sends two subscriptions, and
says: “I feel sure that if one
of your friends would carry out
your modest request to send in one
new subscriber, they would bring in
estimable blessings upon all future
generations. I send you two by this
mail, praying Go J’s blessing upon the
work. ’ ’
The steady increase in circulation
of the Jeffersonians is strong evidence
that the vote in the past election was
no true index of the strength of the
sentiment in favor of reform. One
letter this week contained 48 subscrip
tions to the Weekly, and 28 to the
Jeffersonian Magazine. Such a fact
needs no comment.
Note: The Jeffersonian clubs with
the Royston, Ga., Record, at $1.25 for
the two papers.
Financial Depressions
Periodical financial depressions distress
the country. We call them inevitable; are
they? Is there no cure? Is not the debtor
—many simply in panic to pay the creditor
—few ?
The Remedy
is given in “Usury; from a Scriptural, Eth
ical and Economic Standpoint,” in which
great book, for the first time in years, logic,
religion, theory and practice are so united
as to demonstrate convincingly that
Usury
is the cause of our recent and every finan
cial distress. The author, Rev. J. C. Elli
ott, strikes heavy blows on present systems.
Interest Is the curse of business morality
and business practice.

Anti-Usury League
