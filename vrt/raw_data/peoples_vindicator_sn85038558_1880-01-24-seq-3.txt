Sulday Lagazlae,
As the January number, jast issued,
commoneors tihe sevetnth volumo of this
-deservedly i,'pular periodical. It is a
brilliant Holiday Number, and the cen.
tents furnish a rich literary banquet.
Noteworthy among the solid article are,
'"The Persecution of the Huguenots," b
Alfred H. Guernsey ; "Antiobh In Syria,"
by Godfrey A. Hudson; "Caves and
Cave-dwellers," by Arthur Orabhane, etc. I

Daughter," by the author of "Gideon's
Rock," "Miss Olive's Boys," by Mrs. a
