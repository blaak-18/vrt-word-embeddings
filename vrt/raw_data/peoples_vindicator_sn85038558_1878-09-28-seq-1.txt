Hayes out would not have put Tilden

good pilicy, required tlhe execution

1.27th of February, when I had the
interview with Mr. Foster, Tilden's
chance was gone-hopelessly lost.

of the count. Who doubts this By

There is no provision in the consti,

The electlion in Maie Ilas resulted
in such a mannelr as tIl Caill e Slltrlilise let
both to thIe l lthi.licllea s andi to the 1i
Opposition. The ( reenllaekl.rs andil d'i
Democrats will lihave a i.ljlliity inl \vi
the lHlouse of 11, while the lei iullli .1l
cans, lbecausei of the hlidiig ovil thi
Senators, have 9 majority in the ell- ha
ate. This gives an Opposition ma- lie
jority of 5 on joint hallot in the Leg.- se
islature and enables them to elect the ele
State officers. Whether there lihas If
been an election of governor by the at
people or not, we iihave not been in- -ar
formed. There have been no dis- litt
patches on the sulject since the (1ay 1111
after the election, when the inldicln- Ini
tions were that Conner, the lielehli- lie:
can candidate, thoigh fill Ilr a Inad of (os
the next highest canldiilate, would paI
not have a clear majority of the lpoull- wO
lar vote. If he has not, then tile Re
House of Representatives selects age
two of the candidates and sends their by
names to the Senate, which chooses bei
between them. This would enable haI
the House to drop Connor and send inn
the names of the Gleenhack and WI
Democratic candidates to be ballot- shlt
ed for; and thus the Senate, like our you
recent Democratic convenltion, would the
be compelled to deicidel tlh colltest eat
with the stronigest candidate elinmina- hia;
ted from the race. \Voe regret exceed- of
ingly that there is not an election for ed
United States Senator this winter, 188

Hamlin would be compelled to aban. I

known to be certainly defeated behing ion
Grant's man, Mr. Engene Hale, who op!
was once offered a Cabinet apipoint- titt

by his party in the next Congress. lieu
The Radicals, therefore, do not seem ral
to be making much headway, even in this

up that majority in the next Congress, chu
which they have announced as the Vel

who calme in i .'tact with a shoulder- soc
hitter and got kno.gd into the corner of
of a fence, got up on.is legs again, , and
rubbing his eyes and a-,d if "the nar

Some such feeling must have ,".'- ,f t
ted the breast of Blaine and 1Hamll"
and Fryeand Hale and Hayes when ga
they looked over the columns of the am
Gazette on the morning of Tuesday er
last. ing
The N.Y. Herald is right in pre- ing
dicting that this election will have a ani
wonderful effect on the coming elec- hat
tionslin Massachusetts and other Re- be
publican States. The column having hei
been broken in Maine there will be a cia
general stampede elsewhere. The Go
rats will not be slow in leaving the usi
sinking Republican ship. Nor will its
effects be lost to the Democratic par
ty. It will show the Democratic
leaders which way the popular car
rent is flowing. Ift the party in Maine
had raisen to the necessities of the
occasion, like the Western and South
ern Democracy, it could boast of a so
great Democratic victory to-day. As al
it is it has to sit Ly and see a third d
party obtain the leredit of fighting
and winning the people's battle ,
against monopolies and bondholders. cm
This election will, therefore, teach the ni
Democrats of New York, Pennsylva
nia and other Eastern States that the
only way to keep down the Green
back party is to render its formation t
unnecessary by potting themselves in ,
line with the Southern apd Western
SDemocracy.

a- plete will consist of 85 Republicans,
by 2 Democrats elected by Republicans,

OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
WA.SHINGTON D. C., Sept. 7, 1876.
Before most of umv readers see this '
letter, the result of the election in
Maine will be known. It is conti
h,, ntlv ,lilihvid that one Democrat ,
will Ile elected to I'ongress. Gen. t
.\Ande son in the Ist I)istrict --ad a
that in two other I)istricts the Green- C
back vote is large enough to render d
Republican success doubtful. It
seems certain that there will be no
election of Governor by the people.
If these results indicated nothing but t
a temporary reverse for the Republi- I1
can party of Maine they would be of C
little importance. But they mean n
inich more than that, no intelligent tl
man in the State believes the Repub- 1
]ican party can everi regain what it
osev now. I am not exposiog at
party secret when I say that there 1
would have been open rupture in the c;
Republican party of Maine a year si
ago, but for conciliatory advice given la
by Mr. Hayes to the increasing num- S
ber of prominent Republicans who 0
had become dissatisfied with the
managnmnent of'atfairs in the State.
Whether or not the "third party"
shall have a separate existence be- v
yond this year, the disintegration of tl
the Radical party has commenced in b
earnest, and Iiothing can stop it. I
have acquaintance with the politics ':
of the State, and shall not be surpris.- t
ed if its electoral vote is thrown in d
1881) for an acceptable Democratic t
candidate for the Presidency. g
That the Radical party in Massa- el
chusetts is in the same condition we pi
all know. It is perhaps unfortunate
that no better leader than Butler can
be found for those who make up the sc
Republican opposition to the clique D
whlich has controlled the State so
long, but even he will answer. That
opposition will take form and find a
fitting leaders in a little time. Vet'r
mont is of course hopelessly Repub- ri
lican, and being wholly an agricultu
ral State the deplorable condition of "j
things which causes trouble in the U
Radical party in Maine and Massa- a
chlusetts does not exist, but even in
Vernont the late election did not, as
usual, turn out to be simply a ratii. m
cation of what the Radical caucuses c
had done. to
if tile Democratic party is wise in
its course in Congress, and wise in tr,
its selection of a Presidential candi- w
ldate, the days of Radicalism in New Ei
England are numbered.
Mr. Hayes yesterday departed from
his usual custom of making only short
speeches, and made St. Paul what O°
must be considered a long one. It fe
was chiefly upon financial subjects. in
Secretaries Evarts, McCrary and in
Sherman are to speak in their res
pective States during the campaign, lai
and numlerous minor officers will do va
addition to the regular leave of 30
days. Assessments of Clerks and
Officers go on in the good old way, to
and one can hardly see any difference lit
between this and Grant's adminis- TI
tration in this matter. no
This city, like every other, in the
land, is alive with efforts to provide of
relief for the yellow fever sufferers. Cc
We do not now consider ourselves in de
danger, and are all the more ready on co
that account to assist those who are L(
in distress. All the secret societies,
social organizations, and the heads
of public departments are earnesti
and active. To-day there isa tour- ar
nament at one of our suburbano parks, tO
and lion. J. C. Blackburn, of Ky., one
of the most eloquent of men, will de- di
'ver an address. Picnics, races, ch
ga." of base ball-all forms of b
mservice an&l re pressed into the
ineraiced arn nYms raised and be- TI
ing of tents, and rane. The issu- "
and destitute by the WVr f9 .the sick I
has been criticised, but will pygent at
be looked on by Secretary McCraI lo
hereafter as the best act of his offi- I
cial term. The tents and food of the
Government were never put to better
use.
