Dr. J. Walker's California
D Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
TERS I" Our answer is,. that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life.giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded puos
e sessing the remarkable qualities of Vir
rota Brrrns in healing the sick of
b every dlease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonlo,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.

Every year increases the populari
ty of this valuable IInir Preparation ;
which is duo to merit alone. We
can assure our old patroons that it is
kept fully up to its high standard;
and it is the only reliable and perfect
ed preparation for restoring GuAry i
OR FADED IIMR to its youthful color, e
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white
and clean. It removes all eruptions
and dandrulf, and, by its tonic prop- 1
erties, prevents the hair fiom falling
out, as it stimulates and nourishes
the hair-glands. By its use, the hair
grows thicker and stronger.. In e
baldness, it restores the capillary '
glands to their normal vigor, and
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old age. It is the most eco- n
nomical IIMa DRESSING ever used, It
r as it requires fewer applications, N
and gives the hair a splendid, glosisy
appearance. A. A. Hayes, M.D.,
State Assayer ofMassachusetts, says,
"The constituents are pure, and care
fully selected for excellent quality; ]
and I consider it the BEST PRIEPA
naAiow for its intended purposes."
