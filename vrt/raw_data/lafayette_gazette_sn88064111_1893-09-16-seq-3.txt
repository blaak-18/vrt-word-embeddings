A young man named Robert
Borrow, aged about 16, ran away
from his home in New Orleans,
enticed by, and in company with a
tramp, and on reaching this town
was apprised of a telegram from his
parents, stating that arrangements
had been made with the railroad
people to give him transportation
home, and would also provide for
his immediate needs. Notwith
standing the urgent request of the
tramp that they should continue
journeying together, Robert very
wisely decided to return home to his
parents. His short experience no
doubt convinced him that to see the
world a la tramp did not hold the
comforts anticipated.
* In driving across the bridge near
Moss store the planking gave way,
and one of the horse's foot caught
in the break and he fell, while the
other horse kept on pulling until
the carriage was over the prostrate
horse, when the latter made a strug
gle to get up, and did succeed so
far as to throw the carriage over,
precipitating the occupants to the
ground. In the carriage were Mrs.
Kelly, Miss Effie Young, Miss Zaza
Cornay, and in the arms of one of
the ladies was the baby of Mr. E. J.
Trahan, and the driver. Except
some slight bruises to Miss Cornay,
no injuries were sustained by the

about 9:o, in -the railroad yards at this
It app ats that two Mexicans, who
on their way to New Orleans, arrived
here Wedesaday morning and spent the day
around the depot. They made the acquain
tance of Brown who invited them to take a
drink which they accepted. Brown says
that after taking their drinks they
walked to'the yards, apparently on friendly
terms, when to 4&b utter surprise, one of the
Mexicans knocke4 him over the right eye
with a piece of stone, inflicting a painful
and serious wound. It is not known what
their motive was, but the assault was most
cowardly. The Mexicans made their escape,
but Sheriff Broussard is after them, and
is doing all in his power to effect their arrest.
Carencro News.
From Our Regular Correspondent
The case of the "Parish of Lafa
yette vs. Corporation of Lafayette,"
should prove of con: iderable inter
est to all towns in the parish, which
like Carencro, are incorporated un
der the Act of x88o. No matter
what the decision may be, it is
bound to redound to the benefit of
such towns. Should the decision be
in favor of the Corporation of Lafa
yette, there is no doubt that Caren
cro, and other towns similarly or
ganized, can successfully resist the
further payment of parish taxes. If,
on the other hand, the Parish comes
out victorious, it will increase its
funds very materially, and enable
it to lend a helping hand to those
towns which are practically under
its protection. So the "vane" indi
cates a fair wind, no matter which
way it points.
-Our energetic street commis
sioner, Mr. Saul Broussard, has

-Mr. Maurice Francez was quite

-.Now that the Carencro base
ball club is regularly organized they

They have proven themselves ex

-The high winds of the 7th did
not do as much damage to the
crops as was at first expected. There
was considerable cane blown down,
but the beneficial effects of the rain
will counteract all damage. Rice
suffered the most.
-The Teche Railroad Company
are pushing their work with a vim.
A tap connecting their road with
Couvillon and Breaux's plantations
will be commenced immediately.
-The Opelousas biclycists will

September 27, and not the 27th, as
published in last issue of The

-Mr. Ernest L. Mouisset, of La

From Our Regular Correspondent.
-The public roads in the different
sections of the parish may be in
good order, but, in the 4th
ward, they are, frankly admitting,
in a fearful condition. Daily your
correspondent must listen to com
plaints coming from reliable gen
tlemen-and these parties cannot
understand why no action is taken
in repairing the road, and rebuild
ing the "breck-neck" bridges along
the Royrille lane. Is Lafayette
parish so reduced that at least two
little bridges can not be granted us ?
Surely it cannot be that her cash is
all gone-still it looks like it. The
prevailing question here at present,
is, will the Royville lane be made
passable or not? Will the Police
jury always remain duimnb to our
entreatics, and must we cont'nuc to

"notes" from Carencro in last

to the fact that we were "left out"
