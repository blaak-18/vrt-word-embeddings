BOUNCED.
A Fugitive From Natchitoches Want.
ed There for Cattle Stealing
N. O. Democrat.
Yesterday' .J. P. Hartman, a deputy
sheriff of Natchitoches, made an affidavit
before Judge Miltenberger tagainst S.
Van Deuset. charging him with being a
fugitive from justice and being indicted
for lanceny in Natchitoches The facts
of the case are as follows:
in 1874 Van Deusen was arrested and
tried before a jury for cattle stealing,
but owing to solte flaw in the prosecu
tion lhe was released on bond to await
further developmients.
lShortly after his release he jumped the
parish and left his bondsmeu in the
lurch; they, however, paid the amonot
of the bonds. It was ascertained that
Van Daisen had fled to New Orleans,
where he kept a correspondence with
friends in Natchitoches, who would let
himi know immediately whenever the
sheriff*' was preparing to arrest him. In
this way he nmanaged to escape the
clutches of the law.
Last Thursday Mr. Hartman, who hap
pened to be in town on business, was
passing onil Daunphine, near Bienville, and
espited ia an answering toVan Densen's
descripti'n entering Merier's clothing
store
Knowing his man well lIartman watch
ed him, and just as the fugitive was
conming out he was captured by a police
oftticer at the request of Hartman and
brought before the Second Recorder's
Court. This evening the deputy and his
prisoner will leave for Natchitoches.
Van Deusen expresses the greatest
willingness to stand the trial; he says
the charge was a trunmped up one brought
against him for political reasons, as he
belonged to the Kellogg crowd. From
what has been gleaned, however, his
reputation is far from being good in Nat.
chitoches; he figured prominently in all
the Radical troubles there, and was,
thongh a white man, keeping a negro
school.
Van came up in charge of deputy Hart
man on the Bart Able and resumes the
game left off by Myers, that of playing
checkers with his nose in the parish jail.
Van was found guilty of cow stealing
and granted a new trial and jumped his
bond. That is bow the record reads
against him.
The Laharatory of the System.

the system suffers in consequence. More

Solid Front to the Enemy.
We must be on the alert, those who
wish to perpetuate, or rather re-install
Republican government in Louisiana,
for our enemies fronm without and
within are vigilant, active and on
scrupulous.
The opposition to a Constitutional
Conventien on the score of policy, is
no longer maintained by those men,
who, from patriotic motives unfortu
nately opposed, last Winter the call
for a Convention. All opposition is
now developed into those who desire
to perpetuate evils which tie pres
cut Constitution engender, and which
will remain to menace our institu
tions and property until every ves
tige of it is wiped out.
We must first return to republican
principles before we halt to do any
thming else, and all those who oppose
that consummation, be they in the par
ty or not, are as vicions "enemies" to
free government in Louisiana as the
vilest Returoing Board forger, who,
panoplied by the shield of a Supreme
Court decision, struts through the
State in defiance of ontraged law.
Tihe Enemy! Watch who be be,
friends, for he may come in the garb
of one who, while eulogizing Nicholls
in "surging eloquence" is endeavor
ing to hide at the same time the mil
lion and a quarter stolen from the
impoverished people by his aid or
with his consent.
The Elnemy! That is an unmeno
ing word in these strange times.
Let all who oppose ~. honest Con
stitution be designated as enemies,
and thle mark will not be missed far,
for if it be inderstood that that most
be the test of Deptocracy, few, vera'
few "goiod men" will longer conteud
agaoist the demand of the people for
their prerogatives.
Enmem.-Who are the enemy?
The Onachita Endorsement.
The Stubbs' wing of the party in
Onachita issues an endorsement, which a
none will commend any more heartily C
tIhan we, but, when it insists that a f
Constitutional Convention is not nec- c
essary ; first, because is would disturb t
the present admuinistration, and see- Ii
ondly, that it would endanger the sue- V
cess of the national Democratic party, II
they save themselves from the charge f
of rank idiocy by the fact that the ft
"reasons" excite more laughter than c
alarm. When any set Off men, claim. t
ing to be Democrats, and having the u
reputation of being of mediocre inter
lect, insist tihat the principles of i
Democracy reside in a Governor, and i
would be endangered by the abroga
tion of a Constitution-unrepublican
in form and essence-we are forced I
to the conclusion that they are either (
indulging in a burlesque or that they f
don't know wnhat they are talking
about.
And strange to say, these are the I
reasons, which the Onachita Democra- t
cy, or a scant majority at lent, put 1
forth for their hostility to a Conati
tutional Convention. Only this and I
nothing tuore.
Seriously. If the Anti-Constitu
tional Conventionists of Oucahita have
nothing better to ofler as "reasons"
why they oppose the calling of a Conts
titutional Convention than are found in
the resolutions of 15th, it were better,
if they desire to retain the good op
inion of thinking men, to let the sub -
ject drop.
From the noise made by Senator
Stubbe' party we were led to look for
a new and overwhelming reason
under which we poor Democrats who,
hitherto stood in the way of those re
formers, schooled by association with
Ludeling and Ray, would be deluged.
But this m-untain brings forth the
following mouse.
Third- That we depreciate the agi
tation of the question of calling a
constitutional convention in the early
future as unnecessary, imprudent and
perilous to the cause of good govero
ment in Louisiana and to the success
of the National Democratic party.
What must good nmen believe, when
they are told with solemn assurance
that "good government in Louisiana"
would be endangered "by an honest
Constitution?" What must we think
when it is asserted that the success
of National Democracy is imperiled
by the abrogation of a reconstruction
Constitution in Louisiana. If it is
not a burlesque what other name
shall we give it.
We await in painful anxiety for the
"reasons" of the next, on this ques
tion.
Removal of the State Capitol.
The Democrat sees no good reason
why the seat of government for this
State shoitll be transferred to Baton
Rouge. We do see good reasons
therefor.
Large cities are not appropriate
places for the functions of popular
government, and for that reason our
Radical rulers have insisted on retain
ing the Capitol in New Orleans since
the war. Conflict of intereste and
great consideration of public policy
have forced most of the States to
transfer their seats of government to
interior towns and cities. New Or.
leans, of all commercial cities in the
Union, is more particularly applicable
to the rule. It has a large floating
population, not only in transit but
engaged in business vocations direct
ly interested in class legislation-that
of Banking and Speculation. These
men, representing millions of money,
have no especial interest in our polit
ical prosperity. Nay, they have an
eye single to extravagaat expendi
ture, and the prolifc cause of the
public debt of this commonwealth is
easily traced to the "co.nmercial imn
pulses" of New Orleans under the lead
of this class. The defeat of the call
for a Constitutional Convention, as
the Democrat well knows, was effect
ed by these very men. Tite contest
between Nicholls and Packard was
kept up for months through the infiu
ence of these peculiar individuals of
Carondelet street of "divergant feel
ings and interests," and hastily, the
very power wltich the Democrat com
bate so patriotically has its "Samson
strength" in the fact that the Capitol
re in New Orleans;-remove it, and
Charley floward's lottery monopoly,
with all others in the State wonld
perish.
If the Democrat will take the trouble
to look up the advocates for retaio
ing New Orleans, as the State Capitol
among the country press, it will fin
them anti-Constitutional Convention
also.
If the people *of this parish ever
hoped that the present administration
was to relieve them from the ef
forts of the political bommers of Bid
icalism, they are most sorrowfully
mistaken. They are all returning to
contest this year for the spoils. A
little rope judicaously applied might
prevent a recarrence of these locusts.
At least it is worth the. trial.
SIlenr' Watterson, Esq., 6it the
, Contier-Jouraal, say that Tildea was
5 opposed to the Electoral Bill and that
h bis views on the proper mode of meet
- ing theissuesof 76-77 rflating to-a
Ir edttlement of the presidential question
were surpreased by Mr. Hewett In the
Cowgresaional mouses..
A New Factor.
The attempt to drag Gov. Niholli'
administration into the contest for a
constitutional convention is uncalled
for and to be deprecated by all good
citizens. The stalwart defenders of
the '"last legislature" in Onachita
have rendered themselves contempt
it,le in the eyes of thinking men by
;ropoa gati)ng nucli asickening snhter
fige for an argument as, that the ef.
fort for the adoption of a republican
constitution is an attempt to "oust
the present" administration presided
over by F. T. Nicholls. Governor
Nicholls is an honorable man, but lie
is not the only honorable man in Lou
isiana. He is a capable man, but that
does not abolish the fact that there are
other and equally as capable men as
Ihe in the State. If a constitutional I
convention is not to be thought of
for fear it might disturb Governor
Nicholls, then the whole question of
government is reverted to the narrow
fact that it's the man who rules, not
the system, which tends to the hap
piness and well-being of mankind.
Such arguments are the purest and
most ephemeral nconsense, for the par
ty will no doubnht select as good a man
in all his parts in 1880 as the present t
incumbent, and yet the argument, if
admitted now, would hold good then,
that a constitution-acknowledged by
these very hair-splitters and silly
reasoners to be infiamous in principle
-could not be abrogated and such
was "not to be thought of" as long as
the "good Governor," was an incum
bent.
Onachita parish contains too many
men of good reasoning powers to be
put down with such redicalous stuff
as the immortal Stubbs (immortal
chiefly for his connection with Lode
ling and Ray) has attempted to eject
into the contest with his unmeasur
able small squirt gun. If he has good
friends there let them advise him of his
nonsense and beg him to deal in such
sutjects only as his miserable weak
understanding will admit of, for his
understanding of the questions of
government are unworthy the con
sideration of thinking men, and ex
hibit a panperism of thought lament
able in the extreme.
Call the Convention.
The Baton Rouge Convention most
not only pledge the party for a Con
stitutional Convention but it most
submit the question to be voted up and
call for the election of delegates, as was
done in 1844.
This is demanded both on the score
of reform and principle, and for the
reason that this question will be de
cided in behooves us to send none but
sterling men as delegates to this con
vention.
A Shame.
We hate repeatedly called atten
tion to the fact that the advocates for
a Contsttional Convention have never
intimated a purpose to repudiate
the State debt. This chatge has come
twice from the same source, the New
Orleans Times, and is calculated, not
to injure the cause of a Constitutional
Convention, but the credit of the State.
The basis of a debt which cannot
stand an honest Constitation is poor
indeed, but what must we think of thie
wretch who would charge thie majority
of Democrats in Louisiana with being
dishonest repndiators; for the asser
tion that a Constitutional Convention
it fatal to our State credit, can be con
structed in no othet way.
Shame upon the out-cast that would
utter such a falsehood. The men
who favor a New Constitution are of
different metal, and we warn the
holders of bonds not to make repudia
tion an issue.
We trust Senator Sandiford will
pardon oar failure to mention his visit
to our city last week, when we assure
him it was unintentional and oce
sioned by a rush of business. The
Senator was looking in fine health
and reports himself as favoring
strongly the demands of the people
for a Constatinual Convention. Sen
ator 'andiford is a honest man and
no doubt regrets, as much as we do,
his unfortunate stand against his
constituents last winter, He is all
right now and will stay so.
Now and Then.
Our friend Hearsey is at a loss to
know why we country people want
the Capitol removed to Baton Rouge.
We were somewhat opposed to its
removal until we read the able arti
dles in the Shreveport Times In 1874
75, in.favor thereof, written by the
Major himself, and we are satisfaed
that if our friend will reperuse bhi
sterling efforts of that day he will Gad
pleaty of good raoeaso for the remo
val.
Congress adjourned ten days ago
and still they talk of an Indian war.
