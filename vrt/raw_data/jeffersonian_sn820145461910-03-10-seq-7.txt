posed to Socialism rather than de
fending it. Watson has descended
from fairness and truthfulness and
become merely an ignorant scolding
old woman.

Fraternally yours,
APPEAL TO REASON.
Hon. Tom Watson:—l therewith
enclose letter from Appeal to Reason
to one of my neighbors. I gave him
some of your Jeffersonians on Social
ism, and he wrote them about what
you had to say, and this is their an
swer. The Socialists in this country
deny that the Socialist party teaches
Free Love.
Yours truly and friend,
J. H. WESTBROOK.
Comment.
Men and brethren! Isn’t it funny?
The Socialists, like the Missionists,
are in extreme distress, because of
my telling the people what can be
found in their own books, pamphlets
and papers.
Suppose that 1 were as ignorant
as the Appeal wishes its dupes to
believe, would that be a good reason
why Debs, Fred Warren, and J. A.
Wayland should refuse my request
that they prepare and publish a defi
nition OF SOCIALISM, in its rela
tion to
THE HOME,
THE MARITAL RELATION,
RACIAL AND SOCIAL EQUAL
ITY,
THE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF
LAND,
AND RELIGION.
No matter how ignorant I am,
the people have a right to know how
the Socialist leaders, OF NATIONAL
FAME AND REPRESENTATIVE
CHARACTER, interpret their creed
as to those subjects.
The fact that they refuse to do it,
proves that DEBS, WARREN AND
WAYLAND ARE NOT HONEST
MEN. T. E. W.
P. S. —Bolton Hall’s name is not
on the list, now. His presence and
speech at the “Socialist Wedding’’
misled me. By his presence and
speech, at the Herron “wedding’’, he
sanctioned a married man’s living in
adultery with another woman. The
Socialists present did the same
thing. Bolton Hall was Tray in bad
company, and he alone was to blame
for being misunderstood.
As to the Pathfinder, I have not
quoted it at all. Davidowski, a So
cialist, wrote a Free Love article for
that paper, and I simply quoted Da
vidowski.
As to the Texas “Socialists”, they
are not for Free Love, and they are
not Socialists, either. They have
been led to believe that they are;
but when they realize what this filthy
European mess actually is, those o*ld
Pops will renounce the whole nasty
business.
THIS IS HOW THEY WRITE TO
B. F. WARD, JR.
(Copy.)
Mr. B. F. Ward, Jr.,
Editor Union Advocate,
Jackson, Miss.
Dear Sir: —I have just read your
“slazy” reply in the Advocate of the
9th instant to Hon. Thos. E. Wat
son’s editorial in his weekly Jeffer
sonian of the 3d instant, and for fear
that you will think that all your
readers are thinking as you try to
make them believe you are thinking,
I write this to let you know that you
have not got me fooled in the least.,
Will also say that you have not got
anybody else fooled who has read
both sides of the argument. I have
read ALL that both you and Mr.
Watson have written lately, and if I
have the least bit of sense I know
Mr. Watson is practically right and
you wrong. Seems to me that your
“reply” to Mr. Watson is about as
“thin” as anything I have run up
with lately. Your first tirade against
Mr. Watson made me sick, and now
you come along and make me “throw
up”. I like to see “replies” based
upon “sacks and tigers”, and not
upon a lot of “hot wind” as you have
used in your “reply”. If Mr. Watson
is not right in what he says about
you and other people, prove it. Why
not lay the whole case before your
readers and then ask them “which is
which”? If you are not the “Daddy
and General Boss” of the Farmers’
Union of Mississippi you will do this;
but if you think you are, then you
will not.
I DO NOT approve of what you
have written about Mr. Watson, and
if you wish you may put my name
in the “lonely” opposition column.
Yours truly,
R. E. THOMPSON.
Toomsuba, Mississippi.
Comment.
It’s “real funny”: I told Ward, Jr.,
that he’d hear from the boys, con
cerning that unprovoked and out
rageous attack on Yours Sincerely.
But he’s young, and has much to
forget, and a few things to learn —
so he threw out his manly “chist”,
and snorted that he had “25,000
subs, in Mississippi alone”; and that
he wasn’t afraid that anybody would
have a kick coming his way. His
little milk-and-branch-water paper
had hardly got out of the mail-sacks
before the boys began to pepper him
with such letters as the above.
HOW TO BREAK UP NEGRO SE
CRET SOCIETIES.
Dear Sir: —We are readers of your
Jeffersonian. We think you fully
competent to give us a little advice
concerning this negro “Secret Socie
ty” if you will.
We are troubled with one near us
and want your advice as to how we
can break it up. It is encouraging
lawlessness and idleness among the
negroes. For several reasons we do
not care to sign our names. We are
too numerous. Please answer this
through The Jeffersonian weekly.
SUBSCRIBERS.
Washington, Georgia.
Answer.
Get after your Representative and
Senator in the Legislature.
Secret Societies, unlicensed by the
Ordinary, should be made unlawful.
As the law now stands, you are
now helpless.
If you can get proof of the fact
that the Society specifically encour
ages crime and idleness, it might be
abated as a public nuisance.
Members instigating others to law
less, ought to be taken and whipped.
The vagrancy law would reach the
idlers.
If you have a County Solicitor ad
vise with him. If not lay the facts
before some trusty lawyer, or the
Solicitor-General. T. E. W.
CONGRATULATIONS FROM A
BROTHER EDITOR.
The Jeffersonians: —I cannot re
sist congratulating Mr. Watson on
the aggressive manner in which he
is endeavoring to uphold the chiv
alry of the South. Although I get
practically every magazine of any
importance published in the United
States, a large number of farm pa
pers and daily papers, still I always
make it a point when The Jefferson
ian arrives to push aside the work
on my desk and read its columns.
Keep up the good work. I wish you
all success.
Yours very sincerely,
GARRETT WALL.
Get busy for the $25 prize to be
awarded on April 15th.

GO FOR ’EM, MR. WATSON.
Every intelligent Socialist knows
that Socialism will automatically
abolish Private Ownership, the Mar
riage Relation (including the moth
er-in-law), Racial and Social Ine
quality, Religion, and the Home. It
does not make any difference
whether the Socialists advocate all
these things specifically. Socialism
will surely do the work, and THEY
KNOW IT. Why can’t they frankly
admit it?
A SOCIALIST.
THEY DARE NOT!
Why is it that those representative
Socialists, of national reputation, re
fuse to accept my challenge to pre
pare, sign and publish a statement of
the meaning of Socialism as to
(1) The Marriage Relation
(2) Private Ownership
(3) Racial and Social Equality
(4) Religion
(5) The Home?
I claim that the Socialists of Eu
rope,and of the large American cities,
make war upon our marriage system,
and believe in Free love; that they
oppose the private ownership of land,
and every other “means of produc
tion;” that they believe in racial and
social equality; that they combat the
church and religion; and that their
creed dissolves home life, as we know
it.
Here are the men whom I defied to
come out in a frank, manly way, and
tell the people what Socialism stands
for:
Eugene Debs, Upton Sinclair,
Richard Le Gallienne, Robert Hun
ter, Victor L. Berger, J. A. Way
land, Fred Warren, and Joseph
Medill Patterson. As Debs and
Warren are the noisiest ranters that
American Socialism can boast, I
name them twice.
And, again,
I JUST DARE THEM TO CHIRP!
They are fooling the people, by
preaching one doctrine in the big
cities, and another in rural communi
ties.
The national leaders, whom I have
singled out, prefer to be considered
cowards, rather than be branded as
deceivers and hypocrites.
THOS. E. WATSON.

SUGGESTION ABOUT PENSIONS.
Dear Sir:—lf Hon. Tom would
drop some d—d foolisms about the
Home and Foreign heathen (because
our fool women will give to Foreign
before to Home) and devote some of
his energy to getting the United
States Government to give to every
soldier who has an honorable dis
charge, Confederate or Federal, a
pension of $1 daily, he would do a
whole lot of good. Why should the
South help to pay us Northern sol
diers pensions, and their own people
be debarred? The Government don’t

Mr. Patterson was for years an ac

on their State ticket. A few days
