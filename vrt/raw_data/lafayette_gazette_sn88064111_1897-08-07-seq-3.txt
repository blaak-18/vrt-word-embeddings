The American people would rise up is re
a~liou against,.direct taxation for church
aýpport, bat what is exemption from taxa
t~io but and indirect State support of the
"heir., a virtual subsidy for its support at
the i mepese of the general public ? The
-tarte-avoids a deficiency in its revenues by
nriaerring to other property increased
taxatioe, not by the voluntary action of the
at-payers, but by the compulsion of law,
all of which is out of consonance with our
Republican institutions. The founders of
our Republic wisely separated church and
sate. But if we are taxed for the support
of churches, it cannot justly be said that
ehtflk an State are separate. The church
"ejeps no immunity from the operations of
Lthe ws of God. They place roofs upon
their buildings to keep out the rain, and put
up llghtnlng rods to prevent the lightning
from striking them. If God does not vary
HII laws for the benefit of the churches,
why should the State be expected to do so ?
-Carrollton News, Ind.
Reed of Maine, is to-day on the lips of
millions of Americans, because of the fact
he has proven that there yet remains power
out-weighing dollars. Though a man who
lives from a modest salary, his power out
weighs all the trusts of America. A man of
Reed's calibre occupying the position he
does in the minds of his followers in the
house of Congress, is greater and more
powerful than all the trusts of the country
combined. All honor to Maine's great
statesman.-Franklin Vindicator, Rep.
First and foremost of all the matters which
nee. settlement on an enduring basis is the
iuirage question. In our opinoin this is the
predominant issue in Louisiana-the one
overshadowing question before which all
others pale into absolute insignificance.
Even if the convention did nothing but set
tle the suffrage question in such a way as to
insure for all time to come the rule of the
race which God intended should govern, it
would have done noble work.-West Baton
Rouge Sugar Planter, Dem.
A number of papers seem to be under the
impression that the powers of the conven
tion will not be limited to ballot reform;
but our confrere, the Thibodaux Sentinel,
whose opinion on such matters is worth
more in a judicial way than the opinion of
the average editor, says that the convention
cas only deal with those questions that the
act of the Legislature names, and that it
will not have unlimited power. There is
practically no opposition to the convention
except that which may be classed as
chronic opposition. It is well agreed by all
that many reforms judicial, legislative and
otherwise are necessary; but whether the
convention will have a right to delve in
such matters is a mooted question, that wise
men are differing on just now.-Houma
Courier, Dem.
The McKinley law, a robber's measure
and unscrupulous in its burdens upon the
laboring aclass, as it was, cannot be com
pared with the present Dingley Jones com
bination which swept the Senate by a vote
of 4o to 30. However, the country at large
will hail the end with joy. It will give the
tariff question a chance to settle down and
let us see what the 'advance agent" is go
ing to do. The Press does not believe this
high protection will only help prove to the
people who voted for it last November, that
they were misled. For four months McKin
ley's special session has done nothing but
talk and the adjournment Saturday, thus
cutting off the heavy expense of public
funds, was the best thing it has yet done.
Lake Charles Press, Dem.
Senator Caffrey, who bolted the Chicago
constitution and now boasts that he and his
fellow goldbugs gave the Presidency to
McKinley, opposed the policy of the latter
by fighting tooth and toe nail against the
Dingley tariff bill. " Aiding in the election
of a partizan president presupposes accep
tance -of his policy. McEnery supported
Bryan, was elected by the Democrats of the
legislature to the Senate, and then out
heroded Republicans in support of a Repub
lican measure. Which of these Senators
is a Democrat and how?-llaton . Rouge
Truth, Dem.
McEnery voting with she Republican
party on the tariff bill and McEnery travel
ing home with Carley Duson is surely a
startling exemplification of the "eternal fit
awm of things."--Baton Rouge Truth, Dem.
Mr. D. N. Thompson, as editor of the
Catahoula News, writes in a vigorous and
graceful style and his editorials on leading
subjects of interest to.the State are strong
and to the point. He has done much to
place his paper in the front rank of the
country press.-Tensas Gazette, Dem.
The press should urge one thing especial
ly upon the proposed constitutional conven
tion, and that is, to do away with the
Board of Pardons, and give the Governor of
the State exclusive privilege of granting
pardons to persons convicted of crime. . For
years past the Board of Pardons has been
clearing out the penitentiary nearly as fast
as convictions are made. The relatives of
convicted persons worry the trial judge un
tal, to save himself annoyan:e, he signs a
recommendation, and the balance of theI
Board usually acquiese to the trial judge's
wommendation.-Alexandria Town Talk,;
