17'S COMING.
There's a good time coming, boys,
There's a good time coming,
There's a good time coming, boys,
And'it won't be long coming.
. : Yes, that refinery is coming, and
S t's coming as soon as the dense
financial clouds roll by, which surely
ought to happen at an early day,
: and the people should then get to
gether and make an united and
strong pull, and the refinery will be
a reality.
We have sailed one course and i
then another, and nothing has been I
accomplished. The reason would
seem to be because our efforts were
directed against insurmountable ob
stacles.
Consequently, it seems to us,
it would redound to our ad
vantage to concentrate our ener
gies and direct them in a channel
that promises suceess. .
The Gazette has demonstrated in
preceeding issues that there is no i,
better investment than in a sugar a
refinery, and it is particularly so in -
Lafayette, when the possibility of t
cane acreage is considered. It is
no stretch of imagination to assert
that within a radius of six miles
at least 5o,ooo tons of cane could
be raised. This would mean $200oo,-ti
ooo to our farmers, and the town
would receive the biggest share of it. i m
.In our estimation it is the only
industry that would enhance, im- w
mediately, the prosperity of our ti
city. It would not only enrich the lit
town people, but the farmer's would th
be much, a great deal, better off. cc
And the most encuraging feature uI
of it is that with a little effort and cl
contributions sufficient to form a sa
reasonable bonus, it would be a th
reality inside of twelve months. pl
Other communities appreciate the in;
value of refineries, and are making wl
strenuous efforts to get them, as
can be seen by reading the follow- chI
ing taken from the Times-Democrat: the
The people of Iberia parish recognize
the importance of central sugar factories, and the
have set about securing them in the right
way by offering liberal inducements for their Qt
construction.
Iberia will raise a splendid crop of cane
this year-the largest it has ever grown- the
and the outlook is so good that there is talk scI
of increasing the acreage in cane next year
25 per cent. The increase will be even tirT
more, if the construction of central factories do,
assures the grinding of all produced.
A committee has been at work in Iberia but
seeing what inducements can be offered his
capitalists to construct the desired factories
there. The handsome returns secured by car
those factories already in operation would,
one might imagine, be snfficient inducement
to capital to embark in this enterprise, but flo
the Iberians offer a great deal more. They bre
are perfectly willing to give all
the necessary ground for the factories and but
to build eight miles of railway by which the ir
cane can be conveyed to them front the
plantations, and the Police Jury has agreed nan
to exempt any factory from parish taxation do!
for the period of ten years.
These are certainly liberal terms, and we pen
have no doubt will be accepted. They are the
said to be under consideration in New Or
leans to-day. In the present financial strin- like
gency there will naturally be some let up bloc
in the matter, but as soon as the clouds
clear away, which we may look fir any day, b-l
the negotiations will be reopened, and we dos
have little doubt that they will meet with
success. There is no better investment for A
capital than a central sugar factory, as the
experience of those already in operation za,
shows. nmo

It. To the Editor L.afayctte G c;atte:
ig The old adage ''time w.ill teil"
)n has been verified in t!e late road
contract of fifty miles, granted since I
last year to one individual for the
consideration of S<ooo a ;ear, Las
as gone to the bottom as prediicted !by '
xt nany. at
g Now, if my metnorv i.; right, an
article was presented by :.Ir. J. C.
1g Couvillon to the Police Jury, "i-- rt
e ing his mode of operation, dividing c"
te the fifty miles into five ten mile Rla

tract; besides thle advantage of
t- having good roads the first year, In:
t it would cost less the second year, A.
d and still less the tiird year. Con
s sidering the whole the parish would I
be better off one hundred per cent cou
than it is now. with half-worked and i Jos
g abandoned roads left to the mercy bpef
of roads hands, which will, as hereto- the
fore,cause agood deal of hard scuffle of I
k and discontentment throughout the temn
parish, as the season for moving for
fair
the crops and the winter wood is at a
hand, and the roads in a deplora- hers

past it woult be much better to of- met
fer the fifty miles of roadts to as 24
Smany contractors who will under

who could not fulfill his contract. T
By all means, we needtl goo roadtls, by
