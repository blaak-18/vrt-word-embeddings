Summary of Ebents as They Happen

tunate was rescued from the horrors
of sunless life in the mines, or bar
barities in convict camps. About 105
counties have sought the work of the
convicts upon their public roads and
there is little doubt but that the rest
will be in line at the next distribu
tion of the labor, when a substantial
betterment of the country roads will
be a matter for State congratulation.
But good roads should not be the sole
aim, by any means. The prison farm,
or farms, should be established as
promptly as possible. Theoretically,
a prison farm offers one of the best
possible measures for the reformation
of those who have gone astray, and
certainly there should be no doubt
that it would prove healthful and
wholesome for the prisoners and eco
nomical to the State. It is unfor
tunate that a difference of opinion as
to a site for the first farm, between
Gov. Smith and the Prison Commis
sion should arise just at this time,
to delay the consummation that all
Georgia devoutly wishes.

ion proceeds, but does not
much progress, except as

showing with increasing
clearness the paucity of patriotism in
both parties, and their essential like
ness when it comes down to actual
facts. We hear again the ancient
truth that the tariff is a local issue,
and each interest, each section, each
Senator and each Representative is
determined to get out of it as much
as possible. Between tariff for pro
tection and tariff for revenue only,
there can be but small practical dif
ference, when the revenue demanded
by an imperial policy is about to
swamp the government. Mr. Taft has
backed and veered, now anxious to
save intact the “ workingman’s break
fast,” apparently amiably unmindful
that said workingman needs an occa
sional dinner and supper, and that
clothing and other necessaries are
likewise demanded by our civilization;
again, he has inclined toward an in
come tax and then perceived the fu
tility of trying to get such tax law
passed at present, turning helplessly
toward some form of a stamp tax, and
so forth. Mr. Taft’s mental processes
are about typical of those of the rest
who are working upon the bill. They
hardly know what they want, and the
certainty remains that no matter what
is done some industries are going to
be adversely affected, and the con
sumer is bound in the long run to
come out the loser, just as always. One
—just one —good, lusty yell for an
abolition of the whole cumbersome
scheme would be like the “shot that
rang around the world.” For other
nations are also “revising” in the
hope of relieving their embarrassed
finances, or buying a few more Dread
naughts, or assisting some petted in
terests, and the madness seems to
grow.
Absolutely direct taxation is the
only system by which governmental
and individual honesty and justice
could be insured, and that the collec
tion thereof would present difficulties
is absurd. A tariff system is tyran
nical, in that it taxes the citizen with
out his consent, but it is deceitful and
iniquitous in that it seeks to do it
without his knowledge.
April Ist also witnessed Cuba once
more complete mis-

public. No demons traition of any
kind was made when the troops
marched down to take ship for home.
The Cubans displayed neither great
joy that the last American soldiers
left them in entire possession, or of
regret at the going of friendly pro
tectors. Over all was apparently the
feeling that the Cuban government
had before it the serious and almost
impossible task of keeping such
miraculous order, of proceeding with
such supreme wisdom, as to occasion
no further interference on the part of
those all-too-anxious to annex the
island.

union. Mr. Barrett’s statement to the
press is as follows:
“The exactions of the office I have
held for more than three years,” he
said, “are known to few, even of my
intimates. The Farmers’ Union is the
greatest organization of farmers in
history. The problems in each sepa
rate State, while occupying a common
basis, have been diverse in detail. And
their intricacies have necessitated con
stant watchfulness and resource on the
part of leaders.
“I have had virtually no home-life
during the years of my incumbency.
“A farmers’ organization of the
scope of this one is a fertile field for
would-be schemers and sharps. Many
of these gentry view the farmer as
legitimate prey and seek by hy
pocrisy and flattery to win his confi
dence, only to betray his confidence
and his interests. The responsibility
alone of protecting the union from
the inroads of this class has been
enough to put gray hairs in my head.
U I will still be actively interested
in the work of the organization, but
the time has now come when I should
devote more personal attention to my
growing family.
“The farmers have learned the les
son that success depends upon wise
and fearless leadership. No man is
indispensable to it. It will flourish
and expand, and eventually it will
reach proportions that will place the
American farmer in his natural place
at the actual forefront of commerce
in this country.”

set together to discuss and further in
hoped that the addresses and papers
may deal squarely with the need to
bring within easier reach of every
poor white boy and girl the education
that will fit them for successful lives,
rather than wasting time, as has often
been done, on futile arguments over
the negro. The program as arranged
is one that promises well. Among the
speakers who will be heard are:

Guadalajara, Mexico, April 3. —
Archbishop Ortiz and the priests of
the Catholic church here have declared
war against the anti-clericals who are
seeking to belittle the miraculous
power of the Virgin Mary. An anti
clerical newspaper charged the priests
with ‘ 4 manufacturing apparitions ’ ’ in
order to frighten the people into be
lieving that the Virgin Mary was ap
pearing at various places.
The archbishop in a sermon de
fended the doctrine of miracles, and
. adjured all members of the church to
remain firm in their faith. The at
tacking paper was reinforced by two
other newspapers which rallied to its
support, and in retaliation the cleri
cals started a boycott against the all
three publications, and are also put
ting out placards throughout the town
bearing the following inscription:
1 ‘Honor and glory to Virgin Mary;
no impious paper received in this
house. ’ ’
Further to confuse the churchmen,
the newspapers mentioned have now
begun a crusade against what they
town the excessive number of church
holidays observed in the republic.
They assert that, out of 365 days in
the year, 168 are observed as church
holidays.
