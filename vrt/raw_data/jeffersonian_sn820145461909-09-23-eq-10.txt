Our FarmersA re Saying and Doing
THE REASONS WHY
By Henry S. Reed, Atlanta, Ga.
radically wrong in the eco
nomics of the Southern cat-
tie industry and the great
Southern public want to know the
reasons why. Cattle on foot in the
Southern markets fat, mellow and
sleek, bring to the farmers’ pocket
around 2 1-2 cents per pound for his
steaks and roasts, a difference of
such magnitude existing between the
price paid to the farmer and by the
consumer as to cause comment and
suggest investigation.
The position is taken in this sketch
that it matters not how superb the
beef animal may be, there is not a
butcher in Georgia or the South, for
that matter, who will pay a price
commensurate with his worth as a
mellow and well fattened beef as
compared with prices on the Chicago,
Omaha, or Kansas City markets for
animal of like character. In other
words, such a steer as brings 6 or 8
cents on foot in the northwest, if it
were practical to transport him to
any city or town in the South and
offer him for sale to the people who
buy, kill and eat beef, it would be
impossible as a business proposi
tion to obtain more than about one
half his market value in the
great markets referred to. There
must be a reason for this. The
man who offers fat steers to
the public may not know the
reason, the general public may
be ignorant of the reason why, but
the markets know and so do the
large consumers, such as hotels, our
state institutions, such, for instance,
as the University of Georgia, for in
connection with educational matters
that institution operates a large
boarding establishment and buys
generous quantities of beef, and the
man who buys for that institution
knows very well why the prize beef
steer of the National Fat Stock Show
if offered for sale in Georgia, would
not bring such a price as is realized
for animals of that grade in the
markets of the Northwest.
The question now for solution,
What is the Reason? So long as
Southwestern meat, i. e., meat dress
ed in the Southwest, can be bought
in the South for 4 to 6 cents per
pound and so long as such meat
meets the demand of the people who
buy meats, just so long will Alabama
street, Atlanta, set or guage the price
of southern fed steers. We may try
our utmost to find an excuse for
present conditions but after all the
argument has been exhausted and
all the reasons thrashed out, we are
absolutely certain to come back to
the one fact which in brief is as
follows:
Every beef offered for sale in the
South, on foot or dressed, must and
does come in direct competition with
Southwestern dressed beef which in
Atlanta ranges in price from 4 1-4
to 6 cents per pound.
The next question presenting itself
is how can Southwestern beef dress
ed, sell for such prices so far away
from the slaughter pens of the West
Gbe Jeffersonian
and Southwest, when Western beef
on foot is quoted in the great mar
kets at 7 to 8 cents per pound?
There is no secret about this, for all
should know that beef of this kind
does not, as a general thing, seek
this market. The beef coming to the
southern markets and which be
comes the direct competitor of every
fat steer in the South, is derived
from the slaughter of what is known
in the Southwest and the stock yards
as “canners”; old thin cows, too old
to feed corn to with a certainty of
profit and too old to trust going
over another winter. They go to
the stock yards and if they are need
ed FOR CANNING these old cows
are put up in “air tights”; if there
are more than enough for such pur
poses or the demand for cheap beef
is strong, they are slaughtered and
sold to the trade handling low price
beef.
The South is the victim of the
meat trust just as certain as trusts
ever dominated a staple or made or
broke men, and, the packing house
quartette as certainly regulate the
price of southern grown beef on
southern markets as it is certain
they kill and ship inferior beef.
The packing house people do not
confine their operations to dealers,
but on the other hand, conduct a
regular retail business as well. They
may have one or a dozen regular
butcher customers in a given town,
buying the major portion of their
supplies from them, but this is not
wise, deters the trust from selling
openly and above board to all the
consumers in the town who use
enough to make it worth while.
Thus they keep down the price of
beef, to the raiser and feeder of cat
tle, by selling to local butcher and
consumer as well, an inferior grade
of beef against which the farmer
must compete with his home-raised
and honest product.
Western meats enjoy a reputation
for tenderness not borne out by the
product sold in the Southern States.
This reputation was gained by meats
eaten in the North and West and
only occasionally in the South;
gained by a class of meat not like
the product sold for 5 or 6 cents
dressed and which sets the price of
the southern fed steer irrespective
of his merits. Not only do the
packing house people set the price
of beef, but likewise they set
the price on southern hogs and meat
products generally. It is a fine ar
rangement for the bigger meat han
dlers, men who buy or kill as they
deem best and as conditions warrant.
It is the purpose of the packing
house people to discourage the in
dependent killing of beef and hogs,
therefore, it is to their interest to
make southern markets unstaple and
unremunerative. They have in the
low grade beef which sells in the
South, an implement for depressing
prices to appoint beyond which
means absolute cessation from cattle
breeding and ’tis this low grade
meat which the ordinary family pays
15 to 25 cents per pound for.
Beef cattle dress out about 50 per
cent, of their gross weight, hence,
when dressed beef is w’orth 5 cents
per pound, it means the animals fur
nishing that class of meat are worth
in the neighborhood of 2 1-2 cents
on foot, the hide and tallow paying
cost of killing and something be
side. The major portion of the beef
coming to southern markets is killed
in Fort Worth, Texas, and it repre
sents the carcass of old range cows,
not steers, and they, having served
their purpose as mothers and having
arrived at that age of approaching
feebleness which renders their abili
ty to withstand the “northerns” of
another winter more or less doubt
ful, they are killed, when in as good
fix as is possible for them to become
at their age, on grass, and are daily
shipped to the South where they,
dead, control the price of southern
cattle and furnish the breakfast and
dinner to the southern epicure, who
wonders why beef in Georgia does
not taste like beef in New York. He
eats old cow in the South, killed
and dressed because her mission in
life on the plains has ended—killed
before the cyotes found her some
night unable, from extreme age and
poverty, to join the stampeding herd.
Nearly every car coming to south
ern markets bring two, three or four
grades of beef, the best selling to the
trade for around 8 cents, but the
vast majority of these shipments
came from Fort Worth and the
butcher, without fail, charges 25
cents per pound for meat costing him
not to exceed 8 cents per pound.
Under such circumstances it seems
as though a prime, native steer three
years old, weighing, say 1,000
pounds, would bring a fair price;
that some butcher having facilities
for slaughtering would pay his worth,
but one may as well look for good
manners among swine as such a man
among butchers, provided, he has
access to the cold storage plant of
the packing house people. The cat
tle raiser drives or ships his steer
or his car load, it matters not, to
market and the market may be a
little or a big town, and offers his
product for sale, he is at once told
that “Western beef can be bought
all dressed for 5 cents, hence all we
can pay you is 2 1-4 cents on foot.”
Mind you, the lowest grade of dress
ed beef —old cows—is always used
by the local buyer to depress the
price of the southern steer, a steer
often times possessing such merit as
to entitle him to a 5 or 6-cent price
on foot in any good market not
dominated by the old cow from
Texas.
These are the reasons why men
are discouraged in their efforts to
produce beef, and these reasons are
enough to cause the boldest and
stoutest to hesitate. The Texas cow
on one side and the local buyer
using the old cow as a club on the
other side, places the southern farm
er and cattle grower in a most un
pleasant plight.
In spite of the terrible handicap,
the time will be when the South will
take her rank among the cattle pro
ducing sections of the United States,
