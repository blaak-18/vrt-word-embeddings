A RACE FOR LIFE.
13S A. TENDER FOOTE.
T-ate in the autumn of 18S6 I, with
three classmates of the School of
Mines, invested in the lease of some
mining property in Colorado. We
were young and inexperienced in busi
ness matters, so that the financial part
of the venture was rather unskillfully
managed. Almost all the money we
could raise was put into the necessary
plant.
Before the snow stopped operations
we had on the heap many tons of val
uable ore. The depth of the snow,
however, prevented its shipment to
'Pueblo for smelting, and we were
'obliged to lay off the miners, owing
them at the time over a mnonth's
wages.
I made a hurried trip to New York
to see if additional funds could be
raised by two of the partners living in
that city; but I was unsuccessful.
On my return I reached the little vil
lage of Mater, some four thousand feet
below the mine, where I was told by
Reynolds, the other partner, that there
were rumblings of an approaching
storm among the idle miners-about
thirty in number.
We determined that we would go to
the mine and talk over the state of af
fairs with the men. Unfortunately,
it had been rumored that I had brought
back with me a large sum of money
which I had deposited in the local
bank.
Soon after reaching our snow-cov
ered cabin and anaking a fire- for the
temperature was twenty degrees be
low zero-the door was thrust open
and three sullen-looking men, who
had evidently been drinking heavily,
stalked in.
They wanted to ik now-as a commit
tee of the miners-what we proposed to
do about paying the wages due them.
We were armed. And we knew that
they were.
I replied that I had been unsuccess
ful in my journey east and had re
turned to ask them to wait for the
opening of the spring so that the ore
could be realized on. The spokesman
interrupted angrily:
"You lie! We ain't no fools. VWe
know you've got five thousand dollars
in the bank at Mater, and we propose
to have our money and have it now!"
I said 1 would willingly sign a blank
eheck and allow them to fill in any
amount they wished and let them see
if they could get it cashed.
The chairman of the committee
called me to the little window of the
cabin and pointing to a tree in the fore
ground, said: "Chambers, do you see
that ar tree thar?"
I nodded.
"Well," lie answered, "if at the end
of three days you don't have the money
here to pay us, we'll swing you from
that lowest limb. And you don't leave
this cabin, auther. One of us and his
gun will be outside the door all the
time. Write this telegram: 'It you
don't send tlhree thousand dollars in
three days, they'll hang me.' Sign it."
I protested that I knew no one to
send it to; but concluded that it would
be wise to temporize and do as they
wished, and I wrote and signed the
message, directing it to my brother in
New York.
They then left, placing one of their
Ilnumber on gr.ard. An hour passed by
and the almost perishing man came in,
saying that he would stay inside and
watch there.
Reynolds and I, after long delibera
tion, concluded to offer our individual
notes to the men,. payable at thirty
days. We were escorted to the engine
house, and, after some further parley
ing, the men consented to accept and
to escort us under a guard of two to
the village below to get the needed
blank.
How well J remember our walk down
the mountain side, over the snow trail,
in Indian. flle-Reynolds and I ahead
and the two guards behind. The moon
was shining at the full, and from the
distance, adding a strange, nncasnny
feeling to our already overwrought
nerves, came the cries of the puma
the mountain lion.
It was nine o'clock when we reached
sMater and obtained the notes from the
banker. WVe had taken a light supper
of unwarmed canned meat only and
were quite exhausted from the cold on
our walk down. Retiring to the little
ofice we owned in the village, we
made out our promises to pay and
gave them to the guard, who, notwithb
standing, maintained his careful
watch.
tWhile sittlag there.-mlf froen -nd
disastin +our polsitton, tw. ~of the
miners camre in.. They wre, ths. Ma
educttion itnu refinement. They said
to ius, in a low tone, fearing to be over
heard by the watcher outside:
"*loys, although you have given
these notes, you will still be piisbners.
We have faith in you and believe you
tre square; but this is no place for
you, and you ought to leave this camp
and as quickly as possible. The fel
lows mean what they say and are bad
men. They will stop at nothing to
get their mnoney; in fact they will
think no more of hailging -yot than Of
smoking their et-cnihg pipes. oty, we
will do anything in our power to serveo
you; and there are four more of us of
the same kind. Command us!"
We told them how deeply we ap
preciated their loyalty to us and asked
what they and we could do so that we
might leave the camp. They replied:
"The train leaves the station at
seven o'clock, a mile and a haft below
here, as you know. We will bring
four horses here at (:4.. lie sure to be
ready to start immediately. Get up
quietly at six and put on only your
mining clothes. )o not think of wash
ing of do anything to attract the atten
tion of the guard."
I said 1 would see that they and
their mates were paid in full as soon
as I reached New York: and we prom
ised to be ready for them in the morn
ing.
Little did we sleep that night. llep
fore throwing ourselves on the cots in
the rear office I looked out on the
peaceful, moonlit scene, and there,
pacing up and down. was thy faithful
sentinel-doing his best to keep warm.
The sentries relieved each other every
half hour. And so the night grew old
and we were full of fears for the mnorn
ing.
Promptly, as may be imagined, we
quietly dressed and were ready and
waiting forour faithful friends. Four
horses were suddenly brought to a
stand at the office door. The elder
Malcolm dismounting, rushed it, say
ing:
"Now, boys, quick-and be ready to
shoot if necessary."
We jumped on tw;o of the horses
the Malcolm brothers on the others
and leaving two of the trusty ones to
take care of the "held-up" guards, we
galloped for our lives in the early
morning.
Reynolds was ahead and his horse
threw the frozen particles of ice and
snow all over me, piercing me with a
cold never felt before. During the
night the thermometer had fallen an
other ten degrees.
The noise made by the men and
horses at that early hour had brought
out others of the disgruntled 'who had
lived in the village since the shut
down: and we knew it would not be
long before they secured other horses
and followed us.
Ve reached the station at 6:55 and
asked, nay, implored the cond-ictor to
pull out immediately. \Ve explained
the urgent reason for his doing so;
but ihe said no power on earth would
make him start before his scheduled
time. To our excited imaginations
the five minutes seemed like as many
hours. At last the final second had
gone and he signaled his engineer.
The next station was eight miles
away, at which a stop of ten minntes
was to be made. As we pulled out
through the woods a mile beyond
Mater we could see, only two hundred
yards away, eight furious mimmers urg
ing their horses with whips and oaths,
on, on, on!
WVe pulled away from them and
reached Fairfax on time. The;-e again,
the wait was as long as indi,.ated on
the local time-sheet; and although the
conductor had already seen our need,
no instant of the time was given us.
When we started for the next station,
twenty miles clown the valley, we
could see in the distance the same
body of men just appearing on the top
of a rise in the road half a mile to our
rear.
When they saw our train -mad start

THE MOORISH MERCHANT.
lie Plays a Little Trick on His Mlercenary
Relatives.
A merchant sailed over the sea to a
distant country, where he made a
large fortune by his industry and
cleverness.
Many years after he returned home.
When he landed he heard that his
relations had met to dine at a neigh
boring country house. He hurried
there, and did not even wait to change
hfs clothes, which had got somewhat
damaged on the voyage.
When he entered the room where his
relations were assempled they did not
seem very glad to see him, because
they thought that his shabby clothes
proved that he was not very rich. A
young Mloor, whonm he brought with
him, was angry at their want of feel
ing, and said: "Those are bad men,
for they do not rejoice at seeing their
relation, after his long absence."
"Wait a moment," said the merchant
in a whisper, "they will soon change
their manner"
He put a ring which he had in his
pocket on his finger, and behold all
the faces brightened, and they Dressed
round dear Cousin William. Some shook
hands with him, others embraced him,
and all contended for the honor of
taking him home.
"Has the ring bewitched them?"
asked the Moor.
"Oh, no," said the merchant, "but
they guess by it that I am rich, and
that has more power over them than
anything else"
"Oh, you blind men!" then exclaimed
the Mloor, it is not the ring that be
wiched you; but the love of money.

NIGHT IS*HING.
A Novel Tray of Catelaitd Big Black naoe
1 t New York State.
When the cold weather comes on in
the fall the Lake Kcuka lover of
angling looks fortyard to what is to
him the most enjoyable sport of all the
year, although the average angler
;lscwhere would .not be apt to see
nuch pleasure in it. This is fishing
for black bass at night. The fisher
men ialong the lake discovered long
ago that tile biggest black bass seek
the deep water in the fall, and do their
feeding mostly at night. It. has also
been discovered by them that the bass
have peculiar ideas about what they
are willing to eat at night. In fishing
for black bass. during the day the
angler on Lake Keukatneets with little
success if he fishes with any of the
baits that are usually killing else
where. such as dobson or crawfish.
'these baits Lake kleuka black bass
will rarely notice, and he is not partial
to young frogs. The best bait for bass
in this water is a little minnow, which
is caught in a creek that flows into the
lake. It is called the streaked side.
the minnows natural to the lake
shiners and other kind-are indiffet
ently taken by the bass. During the
day the angler drifts slowly in his boat
along the shores. The fishing is done
in comparatively shallow water, along
the outer edges of the thick growths of
submerged water weeds. If any sink
er is used it is a very light one. The
minnow mmust be always lively, or the
day-feeding bass will not come near it.
At night the fishing is done in an
entirely different manner, 'then the
fisherman seeks water that is thirty or
forty feet deep. Instead of a single
hook, he uses a gang of eight or ten
tied in pairs an inch apart. The hooks
are but little larger than ordinary
trout fly tooks. Until last season the
lure used was either a dead lake shiner
or a little brilliant fish known as the
sawbelly, or a piece of fat pork cut in
a narrow strip and wound temptingly
about the gang of hooks. Last season
some one made the discovery that the
bass, as if to keep up and add to their
reputation for capriciousness, would
take a black fly at night with especial
avidity. The fly that seems to be the
most killing is a big fuzzy thing. a";
long as a caterpillar, and with very
few feathers on it. This is tied on a
large, crooked hook with a long
shank. According to a local angler of
of much observation, this queer-look
ing lure resembles closely an insect
that abonnds at this time of year on
the weeds that grow on the bottom of
the lake, and upon which the bass
spend the night in feeding.
If the fisherman uses the gang of
hooks and a shiner, sawbelly, or piece
of pork. the bait is so attached to the
gang that when it is trolled through
the watet' it i ill whirl. The leader
nsed is six feet long. WVhen it is fas
tened to the line another line. two or
three feet long is tied. To the other
end of this is attached a lead-sinker of
about four ounces in weight. This is
let to the bottom. The gang and its
alluring bait play on the water above
the bottom the length of the sinker
line. This rig is used at the end of a
hundred feet of line. The boat drifts,
or is rowed very slowly.
If the fly is used; it is sunk to the
bottom in the same way. three flies he
ing used as the leader, two feet apart.
liottoln fishing with flies is a niew art
in the Lake Keuka waters, and is prac
tised with good success in the day-time
as well as at night. This gang rig
never takes bass except at night.-N.

.PHILADELPHIA AS CAPITAL.
Monotony of LIfe in the City in the Early
Days of the Union.
Life in l'hiladelphia duclring these ten
years--from 1l90 to 1800-nmust have
been as delightful as provincial life
ban ever be to those who are Ibrtel in
capitals. There ws it little gloss of
finish, aid there was the beauty of the
American women, which led to certain
international marriages, but there was
the eternal monotony of a new and
small society. Outside of this temnpc
racy capital, in tile woods where the
people were beginning to build an can-'
pire, was to be found the real life of
the new expelriment. "i Vilitation
had pitched its tent there, but
while the future glowed with hope
for the country and for humanity,
the present was crude and uncom
fortable. T'Ihe few Europeans who
saw the hopefulness of the experiment
were men of broad and philosophic
minds.. Most of those who came hither
on business or for pleasure complained
only of the barbarism of the back
woods. The representativesof foreign
countries who were forced to dwell at
the seat of government found life al
most unbearable. It was of Turreah,
whom Napoleon sent as minister to
the United States in 1804, that Henry
Adams was writing when he said: "At
best, the position of a French minister
in America was not agreeable. Tile
mere difference in habits, manners,
amusements, and the want of a thou
sand luxuries and pleasures such as
made Paris dear to every Frenelman,
rendered Washington a place of exile.
Perhaps nothing but fear of the guillo
tine could hate reconciled even repub
lican Frenchmen to staying in a coun
try where, in the words of Talleyrancd,
there was no Frenchman who did not
feel himself a stranger."
But what did Jefferson or -Iadison
care for Turreau-Turreau of whom
Dolly Madison wrote: "I have heard
sad things of Turreau-that he whip
his wife,* and abuses her dreadfully:"

Here's a Delicious Entree.
To prepare twelve large mushrooms
use six tablespoonfuls of finely-chopped
cooked chicken, three tablespoonfuls
of stale bread, one gill of stock, two
tablespoonfuls of butter, one teaspoon
ful of salt, half a teaspoonful of onion
i juice, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
pepper, the juice of one lemon and one
cupful of bread crumbs grated fine.
Soak together for ten minutes the three
tablespoonfuls of stale bread and the
stock. Add the meat, salt, pepper,
onion juice and one tablespoonful of
the butter. Let this stand while the
t mushrooms are being prepared. Cut ofP
the stalks and pare the mushrooms. As
each one is pared drop it into a dish in
whicil there is a quart of water and the
juice of the lemon. When all are done
tcale them from the acidulated water
and place them in a shallow baking
pan, having the cup side up. Put one
twelfth of the stufing in each mush
room, Sprinkle with the grated crumbs
and clot with the second tablespoonful
of butter. Cook in a moderately hot
oeven for ten minutes.--N. Y. World.
Making an Omelet.
It is an easy thing to do and not often
well done. The trouble lies in the fact
that most cooks overheboat their eggs. A
simple omelet is not a souffe. Break
all your eggs in one plate; stir, rather
than beat, up the whites and yolks; to
each three eggs put in a tablespoonful
of cold water; somne do not like milk:
salt and pepper your eggs moderately;
take some parsley and chop it; let the
parsley be fine: put two ounces of but
ter in a pan; vwhen the butter is very
hot pour in the eggs: just as soon as it
is cooked on one side, not crisp, turn
quickly and cook on the other side;
double it over when you serve it on a
Svery hot plate; the cold water in the
eggs makes the omelet light and nmoist.

1FARM AND GARDEN.
. TREES FOR HIGHWAYS.
Apple and Pear Trees Mlght Be Planted
to Good Advantage.
The use of fruit trees in highways is
not for shade only, but for the flowers
and the fruit. Can they be preserved
from mutilation by persons climbing
and beating them for fruit? I have
been surprised to observe how very
little damage of this sort is done to
apple trees standing along a very
much traveled -road. When tile fruit
ripens in summer it is mostly taken
by tramps and travelers, but tie trees
are not injured. I think the fruit is
mostly allowed to fail off. I know
other places where cherry trees are
very freely planted in the highway.
The fruit is frequently taken, but the
trees seem quite as wholesome as those
in the gardens. In the south persimn
mons and wild plums grow by the
roadside, and not seldom apricots and
peaches. They are respected about as
much as those inside inclosures. Lon
don tells us that the cherry is used
very freely in Germany and all over
Europe for avenues. "In some coun
tries the road passes for miles together
through an avenue of cherry trees. In
Moravia the road from lIrunn to
Olmunt passes through such an avenue
extending upwards of sixty miles.
The avenues in Germany are not
only for shading the traveler but
that the poor pedestrian may obtain
refreshment. All persons are allowed
to partake of the cherries on condition
of not injuring the trees, but the main
crop of cherries is gathered by the
proprietors of tile land on which they
grow. When these are anxious to pre
serve the fruit of any particular tree,
a wisp of straw is tied in a conspicuous
part. So grapes in France are pro
tected by sprinkling a plant with lime
water, leaving white blotches on the
leaves. Everyone who has traveled on
the continent in the fruit season most
have observed the respect that is paid
to these appropriating marks." There
seems to be a general tendency in
human nature to defy bounds and get
over fences, but to return confidence
for confidence. The original removal
of fences has done nothiing to increase
:narauding, but has worked to the con
trary. lBut there should be an element
of positive generosity in such tree
planting, an intention to share to
some extent with hungry travelers.
There are some of our fruit trees pe
culiarly adapted to street planting.
For a narrow lane there could be noth
ing better than the lIuffaln pear
which grows very erect, like a l.om
bardy poplar. In the selection of ap
ple trees, those that spread low, like
the Greelling. are unsuitable: while
tile Astrachan and Northern Spy are
peculiarly adapted to such purposes.
There is a sweet apple of delicious
quality called the Rag apple. that has
a most decided upward growth. Among
tile plums, Washington and Cce's
Golden Drop are good upright, grow
ers, while such as Green Gage and

power of these steam road wagons is
very great, enabling them to climb
very steep grades. In cases where the
mountain-side is not thickly sprinkled
with fallen trees and bowlders it is
not necessary to follow any oarticular
line of road, the ordinary undergrowth
of chaparral, etc., cutting no figure in
impeding the progress of the stearn
wagon and its tratJn of carts. These
road wagons are inexpensive to op
erate, and are said to be cheaper in
the long run than horses, mules or
oxen. It requires only a few men to
operate a train, and, to an observing
stranger it is a very curious sight to
witness a train coming down or
ascending the side of a mountain, ap
parently with no effort to the steam
wagon. The capacity of the train de

DANISH DAIRY COWS.
DDearsiptlon of a Breed Iadigeoune to thel
Peninsula or Jutland.
These cattle are black and wvhite,
and the dairy qualities are not quite
so well developed as those of the red
cattle of the islands. They have been
handled more as a half-breed, until
the dairy-industry became most profit
able. Their origin is unknown. They
are native to the location, and have
been very slightly modified by the in
troduction of foreign blood. The
majority resemble the Holsteins in
color. Tile head is usually black and
legs and tail white. They are a little
smaller than the red cows, and are
very hardy and thrive well on rmode~r
ate feed. The milk yield is also some
what less than that given for the red
cattle. On many farms the average
yield of all ages will not much exceed
I.500 pounds per year, and on other
farms tile average reaches 4,500
pounds. This is for common. unim
proved stock. In some exceptional
cases, where special attention has
been given to the selection of the

herd, the average will go as high as
6,500 pounds. for cows in good condi
tion. One of the best cows of the
breed. which is shown in the accom
panying illustration, has, in the years
18S0-89 inclusive. given respectively 9.
d7:; pounds. 10,468. 10.719, and 01,905
pounds avoirdupois: but this is an ex
ceptional animal. On the farm where
she belongs, the average for the same
years was 6,176, G,799, 7,317 and 7,384
pounds per cow. One of the best herds
of this breed, ranging from 122 to 145
cows, has averaged from 5,1') pounds
up to 61,880 pounds druring the period
of 1S~(0 to 1]90 inclusive. The last
year 142 cows averaged (,380 pounds.
and 43 cows of the herd exceeded 6,600
pounds.
REGARDING DRY COWS.
5b hy It Does Not Pay to Let Them Ran
Dorn In Flesh.
A cow that is dry should be fed with
such food as will furnish an abundance
of nutrition without largely increas
ing the proportion of fat. It is the
poorest kind of economy to let a dry
cow run down in flesh, and it is almost
as had to make her fat. She should
be kept in a good, thrifty condit"'o,
and as healthy as possible. for not.
only the health of her offspring and its
future value of beef or milk depend
on these things, but the value of the
cow as a milker is affected for good or
bad by her condition during the period
of gestation. If the cow is skin poor
at the time the calf is dropped she
will not give as nmuch milk as she
would if in good condition. nor can
she be fed so as to increase her flow to
what it would have been if she had
been properly cared for. It is quite a
colnmon thiing to have cows come in
in the fall for winter milkers. and these
are drying nturing that part, of the
year when pasturage is at its poorest
and insects are most numerous. and
from these two causes dairy ehttle are
likely to become reduced in flesh. If
dry cows are not attended to at this
time and given a supplementary ration
they of ten become thin and out of con
lition. and when once this happens it
is hard to bring the!-, back. It follows
that the.best course is to prevent this
from occurring, for upon attention to
this matter depends the profit from
keeping thie cow.-Pl'rairie Farmer.
Water Supply for Sheep.
Sheep can subsist longer without wa
ter than any of our other domesticated
animals, but even in their case an
abundant supply of the pure and
wholesome fluid is desirable. In the
case of ewes rearing lambs. and sheep
being fattened by the aid of grain and
other "artificials." access to water is
of special importance, and failure to
provide it prejudicially affects both
sheep and sheep owner-injuring the
health of the one and curtailing the
profits of the other. Free access to
water, in addition to preventioij c ":.t

Bald Spots Around the Eyes.
Tl'he round bald spots on a heifera's
face, often near the eyes, are caused
by a parasitic disease, a plant that
grows in the skin and destroys the
hair roots, thus causing baldness. It
is infections, for it produces seed, very
minute and invisible to thIe eye. but
having great vitality, nevertheless, so
that wherever the animal rubsitself
these germs gather, and from thence
get on to other animals. The remedy
is to apply a solution of bichloride of
mercury, or mercurial ointment, to
the spots after washing them with
warm water. To paint the spots with
tincture of iodine will also cure the
