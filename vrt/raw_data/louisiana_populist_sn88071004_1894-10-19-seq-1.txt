1. VWe demnlmld a ualtional caril
tencey, safe, souind :nal flexible, is
sied by the general government
only, a full legal tender for all debt
public and private, anil that wit h
out the use of banking corpora
tions; a just, equitable lld eflicieit
means of dlist riblution, direct to the
peolle, at a tax not exceeding 2 per
cent, e provided, as setr forth in
the sub-treasury plan of the Farm
ers' Alliance, or some better system
also by payments in discharge ot
its obligations for public improve
ments.
a. We demand free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at the
present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
b. We demand that the amount
of circulating medium be speedily
Increased to not less than A50 i-er
capita.
c. We demand a graduated in
come tax.
d. We believe that the money
of the country should be kept as
much as possible in the hands of
the people, and hence we demand
that all Stat and national revenue
shall be limited to the necessary
expenses of the government, eco
noniically and honestly adininister
ed.
e. We demand that lpostal sav
ings banks be established by the
government for the safe deposit of
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
eat of the people.
a. The telegraph and telephoce,
like the poet office system, being a
neeessity for the transportation of
news, should be owned and opera
ted by the government in the in
terest of the people.
3. The land, including all the
national resources of wealth, is the
heritage of all the people, and
should not be monopolised for spec
ulative purposes, and alien owner
ship of land should be prohibited.
All land now held by railroads and
other corporations in excess of
their actual needs, awd all lands
now owned by aliens, should be re
dfilted by the govcrament and
held for actual aettlers only.
D eratic Hypoorisy 8hown Up
In tlhe Congressional Recol of
Jae Srd, 189, is to be found a
speech whihl claims to have been
delivred by Joaapb Wheeler, so
eled Democrat, who pretends to
weprebeai4h..8 Alabama district.

ggaghetin the doct, giata
of dlr. W~heeler had 1 sn capn ile
and hadl taken the pains to inforin
himself. he would have found that
these bills introduced by Popiilist..
did not call for a sinl, dollar of
taxation. but oit the other hand
proposed aI plan f or relieving t he
p'ople of the bur !cn of taxation
that have len heaped 1II thuu
Iry ,nmocrats and Rlepublicans for
the lac Ilt thirty years. The Popul
li t plat form demand that our -
culati nm meldium shall l, incmreaeI
to :Oi9 per capita. The hills intro
duced by Poplulislt were mntended
to aieCmnlplish this oblject Iby tlh,'
free Ic,inage of silver and cold at
the ratio of 1I; to I. and the is-,ue
of legal tender greenlbacks. '1The
pasaze of one or two of thess4
bills w\ould have accomplished this
and at once done away with the
necessitV for the p :l5sage of the
oth'r bill,. Mr. Wheeler well
knows, if he knows anvthi.r. that
the Populist party has never adlvo
cated or demnanded that our :ourl
rencv ,hould he increased to more
than 8.50 per capita. The Scere
tary of the Treasury claim, that
we now have about _2-, per c.plita
in circulation. The Populist, d'
imand that this :umount shall i,b in
creased to $; Ipr capita (about
the amnount we had in circulation
in 1.;;6). which would require that
silver be coined and legal tender
greenbacks Kin issued to the amount
of $1.75(0,yPN.4N. The bills in
trodut-ed by Populist Congressmen
referred to by Mr. Wheeler only
contemplated the issue of tllhe
above amount instead of the 33.
(ot,lo(0.OIH ) am conceived only by
the shriveled brain of Mr. Wheel
er. These old monshack politicians
realize the fact that they are total
ly unable to depend on their own
treacherous records, and meet the
Populists in the discussion of the
living issues of the day, hence they
are circulating this imaginary and
foolish twaddle, called a speech by
Joseph Wheeler of Alabama.
Lately quite a number of people
have written us, asking us to send
them the bills introduced by our
Populist Cidrgressmeh. Endeavor
ing to comply with this request.
we applied to the Clerk of the
House Document room at the Cap
itol, and he informed us that the
files had been exhausted. They
have been taken out by the Demo
cratic and Republican Congress
men to use ori the stump in ridicu
ling and slandering our party in
their usual way. Failing to find
any Populists bills on file, I con
cluded to investigate the files of
the bills introduced by the two old
parties, and behold I found some
thing rich. The $35,000,000 which
Mr. Wheeler claims for the Popu
list bills is not in it at all. It is
not a drop in the bucket when com
pared with the amount proposed to
be appropriated by the thousands
of bills introduced by Democrats
and Republicans.
During the 52d and 53rd Con
greaees the Democrat and Repub
licans introduced something over
26,000 bills. The record shows
that more than half of these bills
called for appropriations. With
out knowing what amouut any par
tioular bill called for, we selected
tils numbers of eight bills from the
Documnt rooms of the House and
Senate. This was impartially done
to aseertain the average apprpiria
tion celled for by the 13,000 or
more bills iatroduced by Demo
mats and Republicans, calling for
apprejpritions. The following fig

This is a pretty snug little sum
for one I)emocratic bill, but hold
on; we find that on the third day
of November, 1S93, this same sen
ator, Jno. M. Palmer, of Illinois,
introduced senate hill 1152, which
proposes that the government shall
appropropriate $64,otO,0to to deep
en the channel of the Missidippi
and other rivers.
Going a little further we find
that Benator Morgan of Alabama,
has introduced the h'icaragua Ca

es Is it rolillery . If so, why

It it is not rolbery, then why do
the lower duties of the McKinley
bill constitute robbery i
It is true that many reductions
of tax were made in the Democrat

no earthly excuse for increasing
some of the taxes which had bert
so bitterly denouncel.
While Mr. ('rslp andi Senator
Walsh have had much to say about
the lowering of duties on the nec
essaries of life, we would really
like to hear them defend the in
crease of tax which they laid upon
such necessaries of life as molas
ses, and upon such articles of com
mon use as horse shoes, mule shoes,
rivets, screws, flues, pipes and
strand wire.
