By sticking together, and putting
into practice this maxim, -'withhold a
not good from then to whom it is t
due, when it is in thine hand," gave
John Slidell and his friends a long
lease of political life.
Some years ago Judge Sam 1). r
MlefEnery and his friends held that I
S'faithful are the wounds of a
friend ; but the kiss of an enemy
are deceitful," and by acting on s
this line held full sway for years,
in other words the fixed rule was to
give their friends every scrap of pio
litical patronage by which cour;e t
they succeeded in rallying together
in solid phalanx an organization t
that was a constant nienat , to at
unorganized unajotrity.. We havei.hid t
ample proof of t Ij* gation in the
past. Every i 'their ranks a
knew that ift an~ Is to be c
passed around their opponents f
would not get a crumb. andt in that I
knowledge was the incentive to niot
only support one another. but to i
strive with might and main to win f
victories. 'With theti no quarter
was given, but.prr cvntra sometimes
asked, and often with the mtwotive
that actuated the (:recks in their re
lations with the Trojans. ('onsid
cration of these facts engenders thec
belief that it is an inimical policy
"*to catch at the shadow, and lose
the substance."
IT' IS I.4S/L .L FLOkVA
The people of Carencro saw a
chance to get a railroad to their ii
town by a little effort on their part. r
The effort, as a matter of course. wo
was forthcoming. In other words
they got t gerther, and.the result of
their coming together is the rail-:
road now in course of construction
and which will be in operation with
in the. next four months. T'le peo- I
ple were possess5ed with the right
spirit-that of unity, which will win
mine tim.es out of ten.
As we said they ad/ got together.
A feaw citizens took the initiative
step and invited the concurrence of
every man in the corm~unity, and
the response was practically unani
mous. And every man did his
his share, to the best of his under
standing.but with an eye single to to the
main object in view, casting aside his1
jrop ssity for ýrnia.ltýi every thing in
sight for himself, if he had any such
propensity ; nor did any one en
deavor to turn to his- individual pro
tit a move matde for the coutltlnton
good of the general public. And as 1
a resaTt of their unity they are
pleased to note the near reali.-ation
,of their fondest wishes.
What the people of ('arencro, have
,lone, the people of other towns can
do. There is no secret about it

No. 25, with Engineer V. T. I)or
man and Conductor Harrison,
pulled out fronm IHouston Mlonday
mIoraning hound cast, engine No. 635
was on the side track. A few
minutes thereafter engine No. 635 ,
sta;rted on a wild run. Parties who 1
saw her pass the I. and G. N. cross- t
ing state she was moving at the rate
of 60 miles an hour, with not a soul
to hold her down. She soon over
took train No. 2, and crashed into
the caboose, in which were Conduc
tor -larrison and Brakeman W~atts,
and both. were killed and terribly
ipiangled. Both of the unfortunate
men leave families-IHarrison a wife
and Watts a son and daughter. The
men carned and enjoyed the regard
of the comlipny. as they were faith
ful emplloyes. It is the general ilt
plession that a leaky throttle was
the ,ause of enginel 635 starting onl
its miad career. 'l'lhe accident de- I
laved the regular pa;stclnger train
four hours.

The Stock Law.
Ediit,'r 7,he Ga;tzette. Whether the stock
law, as passed by our Police Jury, is in ac
cordatlee with the State laws or not, I anil
not fully posted, but I believe it is a good
law. to put inll and keep our cattle ill pastures
by those a tho are fortunate enough, to have.
nhia luxury.
C'ertainly wre cannot raise cattle in the
lantes and all vicious uttiuals should be kept

Ulttt what I think strantge, is that a snmall
town is allowed to pas. ordinitutces to let
their stock troan at large, on their streets,
