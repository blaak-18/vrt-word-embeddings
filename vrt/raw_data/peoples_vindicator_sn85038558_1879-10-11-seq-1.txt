LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OP
l~patitis, or Liver Complaint,
IYSPIPSIA AND SICK NRADACNt.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
t)AIN in the right side, under the
Sedge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken.
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom.
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general I
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain, I
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
r accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been' done. A slight,
r dry cough is sometimes an attendant."
The patient complains of weariness I
and debility; he is easily startled, his c
feet are cold or burning, and he com- i
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and ahhough
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneicial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitudd enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy. t
Several of the above symptoms attend
. the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten- b
sively deranged.
AGV'E AND FLVER. q

CASES OP AOWE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of C
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and *I

equaled.

It Might Have Been.
Bt WILLIAM ELLIOTT TODD. 4
When at night I cease my labor
Flee from toil and seek repose ;
By the heart h-nide oft I ponder
O'er my blessings and my woes;
Sad thoughts steal like silent shadows f
S Far too often o'er the scene,
And I sigh in secret sorrow
As I think what might have been. c
t
Friends who lived but to delude me e
With their Pythiano tales by day, t
In my night of fallen fortune
One by one have slipeud away.
Those who valued most my friendship D
Pass nae by as though unseen, I
Leaving me to sad reflection, o
And I sigh, "It might have been." ti
d
Where the perfume of the flow'rets h
Lingers o er a lowly grave, fi
Oft the sun's last rays forsake me y
As I watch the gfeem grass wave- -
Wave in sadness, an though sorrow Cl
Caused it's bending blades to lean;
Sorrow for the talse one-Katy, It
Were she true, "It might have been." 1
From the marble-terraced palace, sl
From the grated prison cell, V
I Through the crowded streets of cities, ri
a O'er the rustic hill and (ell,
E'en from Neptune's briny bosom 04
Where the waves roll darkly green, k
Sad-toned voices seem to whisper be
With regret "I mish5 have been !" !

I- is pretty well for an author, oh ?
'Possibly. But authors are not

d Roblard, evasively. He was It ita
t. ted, and Monsieur A- did not think

i room, and having rung for the de

f dle-aged man, named Trouillot

He wound up by whispering: 'Mv
R own belief is that M. Roblard is mad,
, so that you will have to keep your
. eyes about you.' -
'Very good, sir,'answered Trouillot
it laconically.
R 'blard and Trouillot left the pre-I
rf cure together in a cab; and theI
a communist appeared to be in rather i
high spirits during their drive to a
a hotel. A load seemed to have lifted
fa rom his mind, and be talked with
a excitement about the changes he had
t noticed in Paris, saying how glad he
was to get back again. At the hotel I
be bespoke two bedrooms, next each
a other, and having a door of commu- I
nication; then he. ordered dinner. I
u By this time his spirits had some- 1
what fallen, and he watched his com. I
panion through the corners of Lie I
eyes as if he did not quite like the
look of him. Trouillot was one of
those men who cannot talk, and
whose faces do not say much in their
favor. He kept on ayoing 'Yes, sir,' I
stolidly; and during dinner ate and
drank lirgely.
Nothing of consequence happened
ddring the evening. Boblard was i
tired with his journey from Geneva, j'
and after the pair had discussed a
cup of coffee and a cigar in the a
smoking room he suggested bed.
Both men repaired to their sleeplang
chambers, and Roblard began by re- '
questing that Troulllot would leave 6
the door of communication between b
the two.apartments open. Troulliot L
consented, but he was rather dismay. I1
ed when he saw the communist pro- I
pare for his night's rest by laying on r
his night table a s*x-ohambere . re- b
volver and a large clasp-knlfe. He tl
vowed to himself that he would sleep It
as gendarmes are said to do-with a
one eye open; but this resolution was e
soon obliterated by drowsiness, the a
effects of the good dinner he had a
eaten. Ten minutes after getting ti
between sheets Trouillot was sound i
asleep,.and snoring like a trombone. B
He awoke In the middle. of the a
night, and recollected where be was; k
but a peculiar, odor was fillnogbl h'
nostrils. He sa up and rubbed his it
eves. The room was pitch dark. ti
He struck a match and the first thing 01
he saw after lighting his: candle was s
a bhndkerchie (ltying on his pillow) be
which had evidently been steeped Inlm
chloroform. The pungent smell of fr
that poison still lingered about it, I
This discovery atone drew Troull

les into the next room, holding his
candle at arm's length. At first he
could see nothing unusual; but sud.
denly, his eyes met a sight which ti
made him stand stock still in the et
middle of the delpartment. Deep In to
the aloove, and half bidden by its p
curtais, hung the lifeless body of te
B blerd, who was suspended by the hi
ueck to the cutrtauin rod by means of N
the bell rope. He was quite dead; r

(Le Louisianats, St. James, Sept. 27.]
I This gentleman, young as yet, ambi
t tious, active, intelligent and anxious
of accomplishing good f )r his coun
t try. d.strous of proving that the race
d or L, uisnoans can boast of men
.- who have not degenerated, is surely
k on the road of tlgiLimate aesents.
e He is confident of himself and of hise
country. He is right.
n It is not besuse Wilts is our friend I
i. that we speak well of him, and we I
- are not blind enough not to seethe I
t. defects of his qualities It is Imipos. I
v sible to run poiltics without commit. I
i, ting some faults and hurting some I
r sensibilities. Wiltz's faults, after
all, if he has committed any, are c
4 those that particularly belong to the I
wrestler, the fighter among men; to t
the devoted citizen, who always t
a bravely shows up to the front under I
r all circustances ;to the patriot, who I
I for fifteen years has been prodigal c
j of hie work, his words, his life. t
1 Those who do nothing are the only i
f ones who never make a mistake. ii
p Wilts, positive in his Democracy, c
1 bas cast away the ideas and preju. e
dices of the past. He belongs to the c
" present and the future. The race (
and the party which are not his, fully t
recognize hie straighforwardnees, his t
liberal views and his eharacter as a o
man and a citizen. Wilts, the self- e
Sade man. is not an ordinary man. e
f is ideas in political economy are e
generous and liberal.* He would a
know how to give a vigorous and a
necessary impulsion to agrioclture, a
industry, commerce and internal am. o
proviments. A worker, he knows d
what is the power of work. We have a
heard him discourse upon these sub. It
jects when -hewas speaking neither a
for the multitude nor for a party, "
and an unknOwn Wiltz was then re- y
vealed to us. It is that- Wilts we ti
love, who we believe is necessary, b
who can be and who certainly shall at
be for Louisiana a Governor of the ri
highest order. For in him thepoli- ai
tleian does not predominate. Wilts w
looks and sees beyond vulgr polities. q
He has the pride of ideas. If he sae
rifoee sometimes to the political cue- oa
toms of this: country It is never at TI
the cost of principles, and he would lu
immediately sacrifice that legitimate bi
ambition which rightfully belongs to to
every man of worth and merit if that to
ambition had to be satistled without di
a corresponding benest to his coun. ai
try. For he loves his country and in se
it he places his pride and devotion. g
He s a true Louislanlan, straight hi
and full of life. None better than be to
knows the history of Louisiana. He ga
has read It carefully and understands pC
it wel. In consequence, at the same 4s
time that he wishes to see Louisiana Ti
on the road of progress (that is wnat
she must be before others and for
herselt), he honors her in her origins
and developments; Il her dessent
