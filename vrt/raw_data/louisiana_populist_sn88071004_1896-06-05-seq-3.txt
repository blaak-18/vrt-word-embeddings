Editor Louisiana Populist :
I tun sorry that I could not at- <
tend the meeting of our Execu- t
tive Commitice, but sickness pre- e
vented, I will ask a question, why
does our parish officers think of
contesting the election t I do not
see any need of it, nearly all of
our judges and lawyers are l)emo
o crats and they all favor any kind
of fraud, therefore I dont see any
- thing to be gained by contestin2.
The Populists were elected, and
- fairly elected, and the men that
7 elected them can seat them. Once I
in a time an old man found a pboy
in his apple tree and he tried all
th kinds of pleasant renwdies, but j
- without effect, so he tried harsh ]
I means and they had the desired
Seffect of bringing him down from I
the tree. Now, I think after do
ing all that we can that is gentle
- manly, and still they persist, my
remedy is to try force. I am sor
ry for all weak kneed Populists.
We can put our men in office with
• out having a dollar to pay for law
suits. No set of cowards ever got I
justice. FIFTH WARD.
TIcnmE., LA., May 26, 1896.
Editor Louisiana Populist :
Dear Sir-The Populists of this
s, ward are making ready to back I
ýs ward three in contending for their
rights. We know that the boys of
that ward have Ibeen most shame
s fully treated in the recent election
s y a set of ring leaders who are
destitute of any principle of De
mocracy whatever, and we feel it
our duty as citizens to stand by
them in their struggle for justice.
Oh, how the Democrats are
threatening to use guns to beat our
honestly elected officers ! Will
they do it i No, let every honest
( man stand determined to see justice
is done.
a It seem that the Democrats are
e. working to impress the Populi ts
that their (the Pop.) leaders have
sold out. Surely no one will pay
I any attention to this, it is done to
weaken us sad to strengthen them
Saslves, of course, Could it be true
* they for whom we would die at
any time, have sold a party that
promises so much to the people,
and is the only true party there
is t No. I ay away with auch
an impression.
Most again mention the talk
made by the little Mansield aol
dier to the Pos on the hill. "Ge
tiemen, we have come expecting to
d d Popelis s sad egrm in the
town ready to captae it, butwe I
Ind we were mistakes." We were
fooled into this." "Now gentle
aum, if it is a white ma's ight,
we WEhavsmaothbilg to do wlth it;
irthermorw , we are a oig to get
Seutot town atour earliest oppor
tualty." Thse were the uaet
words a the yeing man to the
r. Pep. rse several farmers
4 asrom her, who e tastily to this
- at la ttm.
No, Dameersat, all e wanti

Y TIIE ADDRESS.
Monre, La., May 30, 1894). it
(Special to The Item.) tl
To the Voters of the Fifth Con- is
gressional District of Louis- '
iana :
I am an independent candidate d
at an election which has been or- tl
dered to be holden on the tenth day
It of ,June next for a congressman to c
,e fill the vacancy occasioned by the p
action of the House of Represen
11 tatives in unseating Hon. Charles
J.. Boatner, who claimed to have ti
been elected on the sixth day of ii
b November, 1894, to represent this
d district in the Fifty-fourth Con- li
n ress.
It would have been less burden
some to the people to have voted b
- for this office at the recent State r
y election, or at the regular election a
r- in November next, but the condi- v
tion is not of our making and we v
must meet it. q
Only nineteen days' notice has
been given, and as there is not t
)t time to see you in person this I
must be my messenger to you. a
My canvass of the district in l
1894 was made upon the financial i
issue. I declared then as I do now c
that the question in which the peo- s
is ple of thisecountry are most vitally e
k interested is that of legislation s
ir touching the financial question. V
Has not time and a bitter expe- c
rience demonstrated the soundness 1
- of that position I
rn Adhering to convictions of long I
e standing I declared that there must a
he an addition to the volume of I
circulating medium at least to the
extent of opening our mints to the
7 unlimited and independent coinage
t. of silver.
e Two additional years of national
life has intensified this conviction.
In every speech made during
11 that campaign I told you that Mr.
It Boatner was a gold monometalist.
2 Have not his published professions
since his nominations in 1894 es
tablished the truth of that charge 1
Undoubtedly a stupendous ma
t jority of the voters of this district1
,e favor the independent coinage of
y silver by the United States and de- a
mand that Congress enact their I
wishes into law. a
Can you give expression to this t
e sentiment by sending a gold mono
it metalist to represent you I
i It is claimed that this district a
should vindicate him and resent a
' supposed indignity by returning
e him to Congress.
Shall we vindicate a man and
stultify ourselves ? Or shall we
k vindicate a principle ? Mr. Boat
I. ner has declared in a published in
terview that you are such good
Democrats that you will vote for I
* him though be is in direct ntago- 1
a nism to you upon the all-impor
v tent silver issue because it ean not

action taken by the approaching
national conventions may precipi
tate that issue when Congress m1et',
in December. and Congress way
be : nay, is likely to be called ill
extra session at an earlier ldate to
act upon this question.
He further says if the present
House should be called to act upon
it he will vote in nccordance with
the platform which the Democrat
ic party adopts at the July con
vention.
The signs of the times indicate
either that this convention will Ibe
dominated by the "golkd hngs" or
that it will split.
Which then will be the DemIo
cratic convention ? And which the
platform by which he would be
bound
To be consistent he must take
the gold bug view and vote accord
ingly.
An effective way of defeating
legislation upon a subject is to
prevent a vote upon it.
Would silver men be represented
by one whose predilictions natu
Irally lead him in the direction of
no vote, or by one who would
work and act to secure a recorded
vote in the open house upon this
question ?
Assured that the Populists of
this district will do their full duty
[I confidently appeal to Democrats
and Republicans to lay aside at
I least for the present party ties, and
I upon this the eve of all national
conventions elect a silver man, thus
striking terror to the hearts of our
enemies as well as speeding a mes
s sage of cheer to the friends of the
white metal now battling for the
cause throughout the States. I so
i licit the suffrages of every voter
who places principles above party.
In return I promise you, if elected,
a faithful compliance with the
f principles enunciated above.
