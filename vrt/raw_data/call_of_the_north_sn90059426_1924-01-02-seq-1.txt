SUSPENDED SENTENCE
OWATONNA CASEY CHIEF OF POLICE
TRIES TO KICK DOWN FIERY CROSS
Did Klan Celebrate Bootleggers
Dunigan Might Use Excess Energy*
In His Official Duties to ' i
Advantage.
—K-K-K
Owatonna, Minn.—We are advised
by special dispatch that the Ku
Klux Klan is alleged to have burned
a Fiery Cross to celebrate the con
viction of a bootlegger by the name
of Oscar Clausen. Of course, it is
needless to state that Klansmen are
always happy when violators of the
law get the full penalty of each and
every violation. It would not be
strange if they used some conspicuous
sign to show their appreciation of
official action, which brought about
the arrest, conviction and judgment
of the law violator, so it might be
possible that the burning of the
cross in Owatonna was such an ap
preciation.
Mr. Clausen made a feeble defense
when he claimed that he was totally
ignorant of how the moonshine came
to be placed in his car. Of course,
where ignorance is bliss, it is folly
to be wise, but in this instance, the
law refused to recognize Mr. Clau
sen’s ignorance. We do not know
how long it has been impressed upon
the public that ignorance of the law
is no excuse whatever for any viola
tion. Yet at times officials are leni
ent when justice should be done, with
out fear and without favor. We are
glad to note that in Steele County
there are officials who see the import
ance of doing their duty at all times,
regardless of the individuals in
volved. To these officials, we extend
a true expression of appreciation for
the good work they have done.
The Ku Klux Klan of Owatonna
is supposed to have erected the
cross which was given to the flames
cn the Steele County court house
lawn. Just as soon as Chief of Po
lice Thomas Dunigan, A good K. C.,
by the way, learned of the burning
cross, he thought it his official duty
to rush over there and attempt to
kick down the Klan symbol. His
official dignity burst and, with the
explosion, came an oration, wherein
he expressed in glowing terms, filled
with prespiration, what he would
have done to the perpetrators of this
heinous crime, had he caught them.
Of course, the one-act vaudeville show
brought forth many smiles and sev
eral Ha Ha’s, which didn’t amuse
the Chief in the least. We under
stand that the Chief did not respond
to a single encore, but then, that is
his business and we got a nickle’s
worth as it was, but, thinking over
various matters, the thought comes
to us emphatically, which suggests
that the K. C. chief of police might
use his zeal to better advantage in
checking up on law violations in
Owatonna. If Dunigan were as
zealous in the performance of his
official duties as he is in trying to
stampede the Klan, he might fill his
office more advantageously. No doubt
there are a few bootleggers and pet
ty thieves in Owatonna which should
be apprehended and the sooner the
better. Couldn’t the Chief use a few
extra hour in running down various
law violators in the Southern Minne
sota City? We know positively that
the ciizens of Owatonna would ap
preciate the arrest of numerous un
social creatures who manage to evade
somehow, the Chief of Police’s activ
ities, but, of course, if K. C. Dunigan
thinks it helps matters any to smash
his toes on a Fiery Cross, why should
we protest? A wild outburst on the
part of the Chief is so funny that a
good laugh' always results. Anyway,
has Owatonna in the Chief of Police’s
office—a comedian, or something else?
The cross which Chief Dunigan
tried to topple over by a few well
directed kicks was perhaps thirty
feet in height and had been planted
very nearly four feet in terra firma.
The failure of the Chief to kick down
the Fiery Cross was greeted with
smiles—yes, and even outbursts of
laughter. If the Chief would practice
la savate for a time, he might be
more successful when the next Fiery
Cross appears.

FLAMING CROSS
STIRS VIRGINIA
Fiery Emblem of Ku Klux Klan
Virginia, Minn., Dec. 26.—The
flaming cross of the Ku Klux Klan
again burning on a hill overlooking
the city stirred Virginia on Christ
mas eve, the third appearance of the
fiery klan symbol here in the last six
months.
Pointing toward the sky at the
top of the hill directly in line with
Mesaba avenue the huge cross, said
to have been twenty-five feet in
height and with a cross bar six
teen feet wide, was seen by hun
dreds of residents of the city, in
cluding many people going to Christ
mas eve mass at local churches.
The flaming emblem was first no
ticed about 11:15 o’clock. Both the
police and fire department were noti
fied and responded to the call.
The fire department was unable to
reach the scene of the burning,
which was in a little clearing in the
woods, off from the Eveleth-Vir
ginia road. The police, who answered
before the fire fighters, found the
cross burning but no signs of any
“Klansmen,” although the ground
about the cross was considerably
tramped by footsteps.
That the Klan organization ex
ists on the range is believed by
many now, although the first demon
stration, on the eve of the school
board election last summer, was
thought to be a prank staged by boys.
The last cross burning on the night
before Thanksgiving, added credit to
the belief that the organization exists
here. The last demonstration, the
burning of a cross Christmas eve, is
not thought to have any particular
significance.
PAPER IN ROME, CALLS THE
Y. M. C. A. “TARTUFES,” AND
WANTS THEM TO BE EX
PELLED
“Catholic Italy,” the Corriere
d’ltalia says: “Does not need Tar
tufes, in Protestant dress, nor secret
powers, working in the shade.”
According to the Century Encyclo
pedia, Tartufe, a comedie by Moliere,
was produced at the Comedia Fran
caise, in 1667. Tartufe is an “ob
scure pedant, a red-faced, hypocrit
ical wretch, who, palming himself off
on an honest and refined family, tries
to drive the son away, marry the
daughter, corrupt the wife, ruin and
imprison the father, and almost suc
ceeds in it; not by clever plots, but
by vulgar mummery, and by the
coarse audacity of his caddish dis
position.”
The attitude of the Catholic papers
in Rome are on a par with that of
the late Pope Benedict when he
hurled the epithets, “Liars, thieves,
emissaries of Satan, robbers of the
faith,” at the Methodists, because
they proposed building a college in
Rome.
In 1922 the Italian chamber of
deputies stated that Italy was under
deep obligations to the Y. M. C. A.,
for is unselfish humanitarian work
for the Italian soldiers in the World
War. It was highly commended by
the Duke of Aosta, and the leading
generals of the army praised its
'•enevolent activities, without dis
tinction of race or creed.
The attitude of the Catholics
toward the Methodists and the “Y,”
in Italy, shows bigotry of the very
worst kind. What do self-respecting
Americans thihk of the manner in
which their countrymen are being
treated by the Catholics in Italy,
grossly insulting the Y. M. C. A., by
comparing them to the character of
“Tartufe,” as described above? If
this does not cause the sleepy ones
to wake up, wp cannot imagine what
more they will need to cause them
to think about this matter as they
have never thought before.

CROSSES OF ALAN
APPEAR OVER STATE
ON CHRISTMAS EVE
From all parts of the state, we
jet reports telling about the burning
of Fiery Crosses and midnight meet
ings. It is evident that the midnight
meetings, with the Fiery Crosses
were Christmas gatherings. Cer
tainly Klansmen love to pay tribute
to Jesus the Christ, who is the cri
terion of their lives and it is but
natural that they should gather in
the great outdoors, under the stars
of night, beneath the flickering lights
of the Fiery Cross and once more
pledge their lives in the service of
the Nazarene.

FIERY CROSS Of
KLAN IN DULUTH
—K-K-K
Emblem Reported Seen on Christmas
- Eve on Hilltop
—K-K-K
Duluth, Minn.—ls the Ku Klux
Klan active, and burning fiery crosses
iu. Duluth? Many Duluthians are
asking the question of one another
since Christmas Eve, when, say
many, a fiery cross, supposed to rep
resent Klandom, was reported burn
ing on the hilltop directly up Elev
enth avenue east, about midnight as
hundreds of. Duluthians were hurry
ing to attend services in many of the
city’s churches.
Reports Persistent
Persistent reports are being re
ceived that such a spectacle was wit
nessed last Monday night. It is the
second time within the last two
months that such reports have been
circulated. The first “scare,” about
two months ago, was to the effect
that a fiery cross was burning on the
sandy beach on Park Point. Inves
tigation led many to believe it a
prank of small boys. No one could
be found at the time who had seen
anyone near the spot or could posi
tively assert it was the work of any
one belonging to the K. K. K.
But more details are added to the
Christmas Eve flaming cross on the
hillside. A number declare the cross,
which they describe as not very large,
was clearly visible from down the
hill and that they noticed it while
going to church services at midnight.
Shadowy figures moved about the
burning cross, they emphatically de
clare. Whether these figures were
grouped in an apparently prear
ranged form or were wearing white
robes and masks, they are not cer
tain.
Believed Klan Ritual
Many, who witnessed the mysteri
ous affair, express the belief that
Duluth has a Ku Klux Klan organi
zation and that the fiery cross was
part of prearranged rituals such as
reported a« happening in a number
of places throughout the country at
the same time, midnight, Christmas
Eve. In Detroit, Mich., a cross was
set afire and surrounded by a large
group of unmasked and unrobed fig
ures. The gathering was dispersed
by the police who stamped out the
flaming affair.
Local police reported today that
unofficially they had heard of the
affair, but no investigation has been
made. And the question is unan
swered while Duluthians continue to
speculate and wonder.

If there is anything that could be

The Story is a Long 'One, but
Merits the Telling. For Some Un
known Reason Dailies of St. Paul
Have Evaded the Story, Leaving it to
us to Present the Facts.
Mr. W. H. Hackett purchased lots
8 and 9 of Robert L. Ware’s Addition
in August, 1920, believing the lots
to be located in an exclusive resi
dential district. The lots were pur
chased from one J. W. I C. Cunning
ham. At the time of the purchase
there was no street car line extend
ing beyond Fairview. The Groveland
Park Public School was then under
construction, finally completed in the
fall of 1921. . * _
The permit to bpild a dwelling
house on Lot 6, No. 2026, was taken
out in January, 1922. At the time,
specific instructions were given by
the Department of Parks and Play
grounds, calling attention to an ordi
nance, stating that the building line
must be no closer than 30 feet from
the sidewalk line. In our interview
with Mr. Hackett, he maintained this
to be a property right.
Mr. Hackett built a five-room house
on Lot No. 8, No. 2026, and sold it
in May, 1922, to H. E. Fredrickson,
who now resides in the house. At
the time that Mr. Fredrickson pur
chased Lot 8 and the house erected
on it, from Mr. Hackett, there was
no building on-Lot 7, but it was gen
erally known to be owned by Den E.
Lane, the so-called “Community
Builder.” The records in the office
of the register of deeds show trans
fer of Lot 7 to Den E. Lane and
later transfer of this lot from Lane
to Turner J. and Ernest Starks (col
ored). A permit was taken out by
both Starks for the erection of a
15 feet by 50 feet franje building, to
be used as a barber shop. When you
consider that this lot is located very
nearly in the center of a residential
block and directly across the street
from a $300,000 public school build
ing, it is strange indeed that the per
mit was granted. Just as strange,
also, is the selling of the lot by Den
E. Lane to the Starks. Mr. Lane
poses as a community builder. But
in this instance doesn’t he act the
role of a “blackberry planter?” The
people of the Groveland Park district
are not going to forget the transfer
of Lot 7 from Lane to Starks.
Partiality Appears at Beginning
On Monday, May 14, 1923, the ex
cavations for the barber shop were
started. Mr. Hackett and others
learned of the proposed barber shop
and went among the residents, call
ing attention to what was taking
place. They learned that the Grove
land Park Improvement Association
was in session at the Groveland
school. Mr. Fredrickson and Mr.
Hackett went before the meeting and
laid the matter before the people as
sembled. The charimah, A. V.
Fabian, asked for a discussion on
the matter. Mr. Hackett then called
attention to the Tact that when he
built the dwellings, Nos. 2026 and
2032, the building department of the
city administration laid great stress
on an ordinance which requires that
buildings should be back thirty feet
from the sidewalk line in residential
districts. He maintained that the
building department could not re
strict him without protecting him,
and various attorneys approached on
this agreed that this point was well
taken, but with the permit granted
o Negro Stark, there appears a par-
tiality which is hard to explain. Why
was Hackett compelled to build his
houses thirty feet back from the side
walk line and Negro Stark permitted
to erect a structure directly up to
the sidewalk line?
Negro Stark tried to inject senti
ment into the matter by pointing out
that he was anxious to set his son
up in business, leaving he impression
that the white folks of the Groveland
Park district were persecuting him
in his fatherly efforts to look after
his own. Mr. Fredrickson bought his
home in order that he might have a
satisfactory place for his wife and
three children, aged eleven, nine and
six, respectively. Now comes a Ne
gro, with a building permit, to erect
a barber shop directly beside Mr.
Fredrickson’s home, not only spoil
ing the Fredrickson location, but low
ering its market value. Who wants
a house located near a colored bar
ber shop, in what is supposed t 6 be
an exclusive district? Surely Mr.
Fredrickson has rights which should
be protected.
Groveland Park Improvement Asso
ciation Present Resolution.
During the before-mentioned meet
ing of the Groveland Park Improve
ment Association, the members of
the association were greatly aroused.
Somebody made a motion that Hack
ett, Fredrickson and two others be
appointed a committee to call upon
Starks for the purpose of presenting
a resolution which had been drawn up.
The resolution read as follows: “Be
it resolved that the Groveland Park
Improvement Association i§ unalter
ably opposed to the erection of a col
ored barber shop on St. Clair St.,
referring to Lot 7, Robert L. Ware’s
Addition.”
On Wednesday, May 16, 1923, A.
B. Reaser took Fredrickson, Hackett
and Mayhew to Stark’s place of busi
ness, in his car, at 1556 Grand Ave.
The four arrived at Starks’ barber
shop about 7:35 P. M. Turner Starks
was outside his shop apparently get
ting ready to go home. The resolution
was handed to him by Fredrickson.
Negro Stark took the resolution, re
marking that he would have to go
inside for his glasses, despite the
fact that he had them on. Bear in
mind that this committee of the
Groveland Park Improvement Asso
ciation carried no arms of any kind,
not anticipating trouble. There were
two Negroes in the shop on this par
ticular evening and on the entrance
of the committee one went behind a
partition and the other walked out
through the front door. Negro
Starks ushered the committee to a
position near the partition, which is
about forty feet from the door of his
barber shop, where Negro Starks
read the petition. It became obvi
ous to the cominittee that Negfo
Starks at once became angry. Short
ly, he turned to the committee and,
among other things, said, “I never
could get along with second-class
folks nohow. They are a bunch of—
(oaths too vile to be printed).”
Negro Shouts “I’m a Fighting Man”
Quickly Negro Starks turned upon
the committee and stated, “To show
you I am right, I will sell you the
lot.” Hackett now asked the NegTo
how much he wanted and Starks re
plied that he wanted $3,000. Hack
ett told Negro Starks that he had
bought a lot in a better location for
SSOO a few months before. Negro
Starks then said he didn’s give a
and emphasized his determination to
put a barber shop across the street
from the Groveland Park Public
Schodl if it cost him $35,000. He
also pointed out that he had about
the same trouble when he erected his
barber shop on Grand Ave. and called
attention to his trouble at that time,
which lasted, he said, a month. Fu
riously, Negro Starks turned to
Fredrickson and said, “I can lick you,
you FredricksOh
answered, “We did not come here to
quarrel, we simply came here to ex-
press the sentiment of the people out
here.” Negro Stark was now rag
ing and jumping up and down, shout
ing, “I’m a fighting man. I can lick
any ten of the—(oaths too vile to pub
lish). I can lick all three of you—
(oaths too vile to publish).” With
this last outburst, Negro Starks
rushed behind the partition. Fred
rickson now said, “Come on boys, we
had better go.” Starks came after
them with a revolver, evidently hav
ing secured same from somewhere
behind the partition. Mr. Reaser was
in the car and when the men canje
from the barber shop, Reaser at
tempted to start the motor. Fred
rickson leaped into the car, a Ford
sedan of the two-door model, one on
either side of the car. Mayhew fol
lowed him. Reaser was having
trouble getting his car started.
Hackett attempted to get into the
car, but saw that Negro Starks was
too close, with a deadly weapon in
his hand. He turned and struck at
Starks, but missed him. In a flash
he saw that Starks was raising the
gun and he dropped to the ground
just as Negro Starks fired at him,
shooting off his cap. Hackett lay on
the ground as though dead, fearing
that Negro Starks would again shoot
if he showed any signs of life. After
Hackett had dropped, Starks com
menced dancing, after the manner of
his jungle ancestors, waving the gun
over his bead. Reaser finally suc
ceeded in getting the v car in motion
and Hackett immediately leaped to
his feet and ran to the opposite side
of the Ford automobile. Mr. Hackett
ran down the street, keeping the car
between Starks and himself until he
thought it was safe to enter the au
tomobile 1 . The committee from the
Groveland Park Improvement Asso
ciation went directly to Detective
Smith’s residence street,
but Smith was not at home. Then
they called Central Police Station
and one Cook and an unidentified
officer responded. The committee
told their story. One of the officers
remarked, “Let’s go and get him,”
meaning Starks. However, they were
unable to locate Starks that night,
but arrested him the next day, May
17. Fredrickson and Hacket went to
Chief Sommer’s office at 8 A. M. of
the 17th, where they told their busi
ness. Negro Starks was already at
the Central Police Station. Chief of
Police Sommer said to Fredrickson
and Hackett, “Oh, you’re the bunch
that went out there and started a
fight,” meaning by “there” Negro
Starks’ barber shop, evidently. Fred
rickson now presented the resolution
of the Groveland Park Improvement
Association to the chief and said,
“No, this is what we Went there for.”
The committee presented their side
of the story to the chief in an ante
room, while Starks at that time was
in the main room of the Central Po
lice Station. Sommer went directly
into the main room and approached
Negro Starks, saying in a loud voice,
“That makes no difference, you have
no business shooting at anybody.
Sit down.” (The chief was possibly*
grandstanding). The statement made
by the chief indicated that Starks
had admitted shooting.
McDonald Alleged to Have Made
Light of Shooting
Officer Cummings took Fredrickson
and Hackett to the County Attorney’s
office, where he tried to get a square
deal for them. When the men from
the Groveland Park Improvement As
sociation endeavored to file a com
plaint against Negro Starks, Mr. Mc-
Donald is alleged to have made light
of the affair, saying, according to an
alleged statement, “Starks is a friend
of mine and a white nigger.” Mr.
Hackett retorted, “I don’t care if he
has the entire white following of the
city of St. Paul, he’s not going to
shoot me down like a dog and get
away with it.” McDonald, according
to Fredrickson and Hackett, reluc
tantly said, “All right, you’re the
$2.00 A YEAR. 6c A COPY
boss,” and walked away. A court
house clerk invited himself into the
discussion and defended Starks, vol
unteering himself as a character
witness. Hackett demanded that
Starks -be prosecuted for assault in
the first degree. Mr. McAvoy looked
up the legal points involving the
proper filing of the charges and a
stenographer made a copy of it. The
charge was signed and sworn to by
Mr. Hackett. A hearing was ar
ranged for on this day and then post
poned until May 31. On the 31st,
the hearing was again postponed, be
cause defendant’s attorney was
trying another case. 4 The case came
up about a week or ten days later,
and the defendant, Negro Starks,
waived for court.
Several Points of Interest
It might be well at this point to
stop in our narrative and touch on
several points of interest. The bul
let which was fired from Negro
Starks’ gun imbedded itself in the
automobile door of the vehicle used
by the committee in making the trip
to Negro Starks’ barber shop. Po
lice Officer Cook took the bullet from
the door where he found it imbedded
in the upholstery. Also keep in mind
that the committee of the Groveland
Park Improvement Association which
waited upon Negro Starks used no
foul, threatening, or abusive lan
guage in their conversation at any
time at Starks’ barber shop. It is
alleged that Probation Officer Zolle
told Hackett and Fredrickson that
Starks had been informed that a com
mittee from the Groveland Park Im
provement Association was coming
to see him. Doesn’t it appear that
the shooting was premeditated?
Aren’t there grounds for questioning
Negro Starks’ statement to Zolle that
he had heard of rumors that the Ku
Klux Klan was after him?
As Zolle is alleged to have told
Fredrickson and Hackett that Starks
knew of their coming, it seems rather
queer when we read in Mr. Zolle’s
report to the Court wherein he men
tioned Starks’ Klan excuse. At the
meeting of the Groveland Park Im
provement Association, an unidenti
fied man leaned over towards Hack
ett and told him that all he would
have to do would be to present t e
resolution to Starks, as the
would know they were coming. We
have tried to find out who this man
was, so that we might be able to
trace some things that are of much
interest. We would like to know why
it was necessary to warn Starks and
there are a lot of other people who
would like to know that, also.
Judge Sanborn Gives Opinion From
Bench
Coming back to our story, Mr.
Fredrickson, et al, secured a tempo
rary injunction restricting Starks in
the erection of a barber shop on the
building line point of contention.
Arguments were heard in June, be
lore Judge Sanborn. Judge San
born said that if the ordinance of
1921 were valid a permanent injunc
tion would be in order, but he did
not consider this ordinance valid.
Upon this opinion from the bench,
Starks felt at liberty to resume oper
ations for the construction of his
barber shop.
Fredrickson, et al, now carried the
case to the Supreme Court and se
cured another temporary injunction.
Attorney Peter Hage went to Starks’
lot on St. Clair St. where men were
excavating and told the laborers to
stop work, in that an injunction had
been issued by the state Supreme
Court, to prevent, temporarily, fur
ther work in the erection of the bar
ber shop. Ernest Starks, the son of
Turner Starks, turned to the work
men and said, “Dad says go ahead,”
and immediately work was resumed.
Hage and Hackett then got a Court
Order, citing both Starks for con
tempt of court. The temporary in
junction issued by the Supreme Court
(Continued on Page 4)
