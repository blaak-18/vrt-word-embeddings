OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
The name contest which we started
a couple of weeks ago, and
which will close on August 19th,
promises to be the most populai* we
have ever had. We have received
hundreds of lists of names from all
over the United States, and most of
the lists are nicely written. Here is
a letter from one of the prize-win
ners in the last contest:
BASE-BALL OUTFIT.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I received my
base-ball outfit all O. K., and am well
pleased with it. It more than repays
me for the effort I put forth in writ
ing my letter to the Jeffersonians.
Please accept thanks. Please send
me some subscription blanks, and
tell me what the commission is on
a dollar. I will do my best for your
grand paper.—Yours sincerely, Har
per Cole, Jr., Roanoke, Ala.
(We have sent some subscription
blanks and sample copies, and you
can earn some good money this fall.)
ANOTHER YOUNG NAMESAKE.
Dear Mr. Watson:—This is to let
you know of your namesake. He is
two years of age, and is one of the
brightest little boys you ever saw,
for his age. People all say he will
certainly make a smart man. We
would send you one of his pictures,
but we haven’t any by himself. We
will have some made soon, and will
send you one. We will also appre
ciate one of yours for him. His
name is Thomas E. Watson. He is
being trained by Missionary Baptist
parents of strong faith. He is a
grandson of J. R. Motley. His grand
father and father heard you speak at
Prescott, and were much delighted
with your speech. Hoping you will
appreciate him enough to deem him
worthy of a keepsake from you, we
remain, Andrew and Ora Motley,
Amity, Ark.
A LOUISIANA GIRL.
Here comes a little Louisiana girl
knocking at your door. Won’t you
please let me in? I wrote to another
paper four times, but my letters were
not printed at all. Now you woudn’t
treat any one that way, would you?
I would send you my picture, but I
am so thin that I know’ you wouldn’t
want it, unless you are different from
my brother and sister. They always
make fun of me, and call me a pole.
Well, I guess this is enough about
that. Beatrice Lackey, my name is
Beatrice, too. Is Leila Lackey a rela
tive of yours? Well, Daddy Jim, I
guess you are tired of reading such
nonsense so will close, hoping to see
this in print.—Beatrice Rice, Brit
tany, La.
Write amusing letters and we shall
be glad to hear from you, Miss
Beatrice. “Laugh, and the W&rld
laughs with you.” Come with a smile
on your face, and you will always be
welcome.
FROM THE STAKED PLAINS.
Inclosed please find one dollar.
Please send your magazine to Tulia,
Texas, for one year, and send me as
a premium the pocket-knife, with
'Seffersonian
Mr. Watson’s photo on handle. lam
a little boy, 10 years of age, and live
on the Staked Plains, Texas. I will
try to get you some more subscrib
ers.—G. W. Edwards, Tulia, Texas.
THE NAME CONTEST.
I am a little boy, 13 years of age.
My papa takes the Jeffersonian, and
he thinks it is a grand paper. Well,
Daddy Jim, I have never tried to win
a prize before; but I am going to try
to win one in the name contest, so I
will send you all the names I can
think of. You never said if we could
use one letter twice in one name, so I
haven’t used it but once; but if we
can use them twice, I can send several
more names.—A Watson boy, Josh
Blackstone, R. F. D. 1, Blythe, Ga.
(You are all right. A letter can
be used only once in any one name.)
ON AN ALABAMA FARM.
I am a little boy, 14 years of age,
and I have three sisters and three
brothers. We run a two-horse farm,
and make about twelve bales of cot
ton and about 300 bushels of corn.
I haven’t been to school this year, and
I have been plowing ever since I
could reach the plow handles. Papa
takes the Jeffersonian. This is my
first letter, so I will close for this
time.—George Guy Mixon, R. F. D. 1,
Elba, Ala.
OUR POST-CARDS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I received the
post-cards and papers, and we are
all delighted with them. I thank you
for them. We are taking two of
your weekly Jeffersonians, and are
giving one of them to people who are
not subscribers. lam trying to get
some subscribers to your paper. I
am showing the cards and papers to
our neighbors; they think that they
are just beautiful. I will close by
saying: “I hope that w’hen your work
is ended, your mantle will rest on
me.” I am a little boy, 14 years old.
—Conway Floyd, Conley, Ga.
A PRIZE WINNER.
I won a prize in Our Post-Card
Club on “What I Hope to Be,” and
have just received it. It is a nice
ring, set with pearls, a perfect beauty.
I can not express my thanks to Daddy
Jim. I will give you a few names
which are spelled with the letters in
the puzzle in last week’s paper.—Fi
dettie Callaway, 13 years old, Ash
land, Ala.
A SOUTH CAROLINA SPINNER.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have never
w’ritten you a letter before, but my
papa takes the Jeffersonian, and
thinks he couldn't do without it, so I
thought I would try to get a premium
out of the name contest. I have some
names; could get more by using the
same letter twice. You will see I
haven’t done this. If I should win,
please send me the knife, as I am a
spinner and use one.—Addie Smith,
12 years old, Iva, S. C.

“Bethany” and other books of Mr.
Watson’s, on a liberal commission.
