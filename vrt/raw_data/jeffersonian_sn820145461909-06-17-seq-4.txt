Summary of Events
Hawaii is in the grip, apparently,
of a very serious labor strike, incited
and fostered by the Jap-
The Yellow anese laborers who
Peril. have swarmed to the
Island. The planters of
Hawaii have recently sent to the
Territorial Board of Immigration a
plea for 2000 white laborers.
They offer S2O a month for the
first year, s2l for the second and $2 2
for the third of employment to male
adult laborers, and from $lO to sls
a month for women and children;
also a two-room cottage for families
and an acre of ground, the house and
land to become the property of the
laborer on the completion of three
years’ service.
Considering the climate of the Is
land and the abundance of its pro
ducts, all natural conditions contrib
uting to cheap living, the prices of
fered by the planters for agricultural
labor seem pretty fair. It cannot be
assumed, then, that the Japanese
have reasonable grounds for' their de
mands. It looks more like a determi
nation to control the Island politi
cally.
The question of Japanese immigra
tion is going to be a burning one in
the next decade. Wherever the Jap
anese lands, he speedily attempts to
dominate. It is reasonably certain
from all reports that the “Gentle
mens’ agreement’’ as to keeping Jap
anese immigration from American
shores is not proving very binding.
It is also stated that steamship com
panies, for their own profit, are en
couraging the Orientals to come
over.
The strike in Hawaii will doubt
less prove an object lesson. With
white labor in its own home every
fair minded individual must sympa
thize. But with greedy and conten
tious aliens, backed up by a govern
ment anxious to gain foot-holds in
the Pacific, there can be no toler
ance. In his own home the Jap is
the most taxed, burdened and abject
subject in the world. Adachi Kin
nosuki, Japanese journalist, recently
stated:
“On the average the people of
Japan pay about 30 per cent, of their
net income in taxation in one form
or another —a taxation which would
create a revolution in Europe or
America within twenty-four hours.”
An income tax of from 17 per cent,
on incimes of $500.00 to 68 per cent,
on incomes on $50,000 or over is
levied to bear the expense of being a
world power. No sooner does the
Jap get to some country where he
makes more money and has less ex
pense than he ever knew before,
than he stirs up strife, demands the
benefits of all institutions to which
he contributes nothing at all, de
mands social equality revolting to the
Caucasian and becomes generally a
menace. The time to stop Japanese
immigration is now— not when the
country is overrun with them.
Dispatches indicate that United
States postoffice inspectors from Cin-
cinnati believe that they
have discovered evi
dence that Marion, Ohio,
is the headquarters of
The Black
Hand,
the Black Hand Society of this coun
try, and they are certain Samuel
Lima is the head of the murderous
gang.
This is another news item that
may be characterized as “important
if true.” Certain it is, however, that
enough has been unearthed to show
that miscreants at that point have
laid hundreds of people under trib
ute, and it is earnestly to be hoped
that the government inspectors have
brought about the beginning of the
end of this diabolical association.
Further develoments are eagerly
awaited.

as They Happen Dei..
Winston Spencer Churchill, presi
dent of the London Board of Trade,
and Mr. Lloyd George
are determined to bring
England to serious grap
ples with the problem

of the unemployed. Mr. Churchill
has announced that he will introduce
a bill in the House of Commons cre
ating a national system of employ
ment insurance, covering nearly all
trades. The fund for this is to be
contributed jointly by the workmen,
the employers and the state.
It would seem that Great Britain
at last has come to the realization
that her army of paupers must be re
duced if England is to stave off a
revolution; and in away that some
times appears rather blind, the gov
ernment is trying to alleviate the
terrible conditions of the poor.
Where England has gone, Ameri
ca must go unless immediate return
is made to Jeffersonian principles of
government. Pensions and all other
palliative schemes to relieve would
be entirely unnecessary if a fair
chance were given to each citizen.
Because England proper is a very
small country the evils of the con
centration of wealth are more strik
ing than in our vast territory as yet,
but the curse of allowing a privileged
class to drain the wealth produced
by the unprivileged can have but one
result.
Mr. Castro has bobbed up again.
Only recently was it reported that he
was practically doomed
by paresis and that his
sun had set. And now

comes the story that he had so suc
cessfully intrigued for somewhere in
Spain as to get hold of some 30,000
rifles with which to equip an expedi
tion to Venezuela for the purpose of
re-establishing himself in that coun
try.
Civil war is always deplorable and
perhaps it is as well that the revolu
tionary project was discovered in
time to be checked; and yet so far
as Messrs. Castro and his successor
Gomez are concerned one cannot
avoid the feeling that if the former
could be given a f air chance to
trounce the treacherous Gomez, ret
ributive justice would be comforted.
Castro, like Porfirio Diaz, dictator of
Mexico, will probably remain a mys
tery. But the bantam-like courage
of Castro at least challenges admira
tion in a world much too full of the
sleek, fat, spineless “conservative”
element.
Dispatches concerning the alleged
expedition to Venezuela state that “it
is known that a firm of New York
ship brokers recently sold two ves
sels adapted for the purposes of the
filibustering expedition to persons
supposed to be interested in South
American affairs. At last accounts
both of these vessels were in the
neighborhood of Norfolk, Va., and if
one of them has gone to Edenton, N.
C., the news has not yet been offi
cially received. That port is be
lieved to be admirably adapted to the
organization of an expedition of this
character. But the government offi
cials believe that it is the purpose
of the moving spirits in this affair to
keep within the technical limits of
the law, and to take on the necessary
arms and ammunition at some point
between Edenton and Venezuela, out
side the territorial limits of the Uni
ted States.”
Steadily climbs the demand for
more money for the “big ditch.” Es-
timates calling for $35,-
000,000 have just been
received by Secretary of
The Canal.
War Dickinson, who “finds it difficult
to reduce the estimates.” Congress
also “has learned that a reduction of
the merely invites a defi
ciency appropriation later.” The
people may as well stand and deliver,
for if the coin isn’t shelled out in
stantly, it must be dragged out a few
months later on. What Mr. Dickin
son found out on his junket to Pan
ama, aside from the need of more,
and ever more appropriations, no one
seems able to discover.
