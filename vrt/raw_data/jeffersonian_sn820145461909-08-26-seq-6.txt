SAD CASES HERE AT HOME.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I have been a
silent reader of both your publica
tions for some time, and I think
every one of your admirers ought to
write to you and let you know that
we are in sympathy with you. This
is my first attempt to write to any
paper, although I have been wanting
to for some time, but just didn’t
know how. I have been interested
in all your subjects, but especially
your articles on Foreign Missions.
I want to say just here that I am
a Methodist and believe in preaching
the Gospel to every creature, and
nothing more.
I am ashamed of the way my
church paper editors have been get
ting mad and cutting up Jack gen
erally because you have been expos
ing this Foreign Mission question. I
want to call your attention to some
tacts that I am in possession of con
cerning home missions.
I know a family of childern that
live in less than two miles from my
home that have never heard a ser
mon preached. They are seven in
number, and their ages are from 1
to 18 years. They are poor and don’t
think they can dress well enough to
go to church —they are white chil
dren; and yet we are sending our
money half-way around the world to
clothe the yellow children of China.
I also know a young man that,
after he had been married several
years and had two or three children,
felt that God wanted him to preach.
Now, this young man was uneducated
and, being a Methodist, he couldn’t
get into the Conference. He had no
means of support other than his daily
labor, and, you see, with the family
on his hands, he couldn’t go to
school. Our Mission Board offers no
help to a character like this, right
nere at home; but they go straight
way to Japan, China, or some other
foreign country, and look up a heath
en, educate him, and give him work
at good pay.
In the name of common sense,
what are we coming to, Mr. Watson?
Yours very truly,
SAM EMORY.
La Grange, Ga., Rt. 1, Aug 5, 1909.
Editorial Note: The Jeffersonian
publishes such letters as the forego
ing for a double purpose. First, —it
encourages the uneducated man to
come forward and express his views
about things. Second, —it is the best
way of finding out the real facts con
cerning the lives of our common peo
ple. I have made it a point never to
turn down a communication from
any one, no matter how badly writ
ten or spelled, if it impressed me as
coming from some good man or wo
man who had something to say that
was worth while. —T. E. W.
NEBRASKA DEMOCRATS SICK.
Dear Sir: —It seems to me as
though this was the ideal time for
the Populists to get together and be
gin work for a thorough party organi
zation. The time is certainly ripe
here in Nebraska. We elected a
Democratic Legislature here last
year that violated every pledge they
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
made us, and the people are thor
oughly disgusted with it. I heard a
man, who has always been with the
Democratic party, say tonight that he
had voted that ticket for the last
time. From this time on he will
either vote a third party ticket or
stay at home. When men who have
lived a lifetime in the belief in one
party make such changes, something
must be wrong. Now is certainly the
time, then, for us to get to work. If
we don’t, the Socialists will get ahead
of us. For my part Ido not believe
in Socialism, but I shall most cer
tainly begin to work for them in the
near future if some action is not
taken by the Populists. Let us form
a party organization and take the
one plank of direct legislation for our
platform and make a fight on that
one issue alone, and you will see that
we will make a decided gain. Come,
Brother Watson, call a convention
and let the people know we mean
business.
Yours truly,
ALLEN L. POWELL,
Editor Sterling (Neb.) Sun.
Hello! What’s this? Democrats

forms and pledges?
Another case of promising “imme

WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO
TURN UP.
We are fully persuaded in our
mind that “accepted guesses” account
for the present apathy of the People’s
party.
Populists have their weaknesses,
and if we were called on to name
the one most pronounced we would
name it “Waiting for something to
turn up.”
If there was not a serious side to
the matter we would say we were
refreshed and delighted on reading
how wonderfully prophetic some are
and with what they know about the
future. But when we think how all
have failed in the past, then it is
our amusement turns to something
else.
Well, what do you suppose our
“Prophets' are waiting for?—listen.
A coming together of all Reform par
ties, and a crystalization of all into
one great, radical reform party.
Mr. Populist, don’t you know you
are an Ishmaelite in politics?
Jo. A. Parker called a conference
to meet at Louisville, Ky., and one
at St. Louis, Mo., to consolidate all
reform forces; all had a timely invi
tation to be on hand, and in response
Prohibitionists and Socialists were
there, —but without authority to act,
—and they each took turn to con
vince the Populist that the “money
question” was of little or no conse
quence. The Socialist demanded the
main issue to be that “The Govern
ment should own all the means of
production and distribution.”
The Prohibitionist demanded that
"The Government should abolish the
manufacture, sale and importation
of liquor as a beverage.”
The Socialist would not listen to
any proposition the Populist had 1
3effersontan
make, and the result of both confer
ences was nothing was done, and all
we gained by the meetings was to
learn, as Populists, we had either to
go to them, or go straight ahead with
our business.
The Populist party stands alone
on the financial problem of the day.
When you take away from the
Populist party its position on the
money issue and national banks you
take away its life.
Take prohibition out of the Prohi
bition platform, what would you have
to hold the Prohibitionists together?
And can’t you see that the Populists,
like the Prohibitionists, would scatter
and lose identity?
It looks to us like political mad
ness to think that any one could lead
the Populists into another organiza
tion. Men that study economic ques
t’ons, and free to express their views,
are not easily turned about, and,
we may add, in addition to waiting
for something to turn up, that the
Populists are afflicted with a large
dose of independence.
We should get our National Com
mittees together and do something,
if it is only to agree to a quiet fu
neral.

ANENT A HARDSHELL SERMON.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —Enclosed
find money order for two dollars, re
newal to the two Jeffersonians, the
two best papers published in the in
terest of the wealth producers. Your
articles on Missions has knocked a
hole in the heads of the little soft
headed preachers, at least it is ap
parent from the way they squirm and
use abusive terms, instead of argu
ments that should characterize a fol
lower of the lowly Nazarine. Why
not the Board of Missions set apart
a small part of the mission fund for
the training of that class of preach
ers that have not learned self-respect.
Where is Bro. Dixon, the champion
reformer and editor of the Missouri
World, that never surrendered, but
went down with the flag of reform
floating at the masthead? Bro.
Dixon, write an article for The Jef
fersonian that your friends may hear
from you. Will you please send me
the pocket-knife as a birthday pres
ent? Wishing you and your patrons
a long life of prosperity, I am your
friend and co-worker for reform,
WM. S. MURRAY.
Skyland, N. C., Rt. 1.
P. S.—Would you publish a Hard
shell sermon if I should write one
for The Jeffersonian? If you will,
please write me.
W. S. MURRAY.
Skyland, N. C.
Answer: We have to draw the line
somewhere, Bro. Murray, and I
think I shall have to ask you to hold
that sermon till I get there. You
can preach it to me, and I will then
pass it out in small doses to the
boys.

FAVORS NEW ORGANIZATION.
Dear Sir:—l favor a new organiza
tion, including everybody that wants
political reformation, regardless of
former party affiliation, and I think
a convention, composed of these kind
of individuals, should be called some
time this fall or winter. I am not
certain who should make the call. I
favor a contribution from every one
who is in actual need of reform. Am
willing to contribute my part as soon
as the convention is called. There is
one thing sure, we will need con
siderable money to perpetuate the in
stitution as soon as organized.

FROM THE ANNISTON TRADES
COUNCIL.
Dear Sir:—On Monday, Septem
ber 6, 1909, the “Anniston Trades
Council,” composed of all the labor
organizations in this city, will hold a
monster celebration of “Labor Day”
at Oxford Lake Park. We will have
a big free barbecue, races, games, and
other attractions. We expect to en
tertain, at the lowest estimate, from
four to six thousand people. We
are very desirous of securing for that
occasion a speaker, or speakers, of
State-wide and national reputation.
Therefore, we extend to you our most
cordial and hearty invitation to be
present with us on that date and de
liver an address of from thirty min
utes to one hour’s duration, choosing
your own subject for your address.
We can insure you a large and ap
preciative audience, as we will have
people from all parts of this and
adjoining counties, amongst whom
Tom Watson is a name to conjure
with.
We realize fully that we are ask
ing a great deal of a man who is as
.UH/
busy as you are. But we realize,
also, that you have closest to your
heart the interests of the people who
have to make their living with their
hands, farmers, mechanics and la
borers.
We assure you that if you can
come here we will show our appre
ciation in a manner worthy of the
great cause we represent.
Please let us know as soon as pos
sible whether or not you can come;
also, if you can come, what the prob
able cost to us will be.
Thanking you in advance for your
courtesy, we remain,
Yours very truly,
ANNISTON TRADES COUNCIL.
