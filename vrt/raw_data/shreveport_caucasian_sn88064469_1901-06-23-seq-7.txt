1 MEMORIAL TO QUEEN.
New York Chamber of Commeree Cm
tributes to Fund, aglis.rmen Oaoet.
New York. June 22.-A dispatch to
The Tribune from London says when
the delegates of the New York Oham
ber of Commerce were in London they
subscribed to the Victorian memorial
and left J. P. Morgan in charge. This
millionaire tribute to the partial sub
scriptions is reported to have amounted
to £6000 without Morgan's check, and
it has been understood the amout may
be enlarged to £20,000.
There was a proposal that the dele
gates' money be turned over to the Man
sion House fund, but this was not acted
upon. Delegates retired from the fes
tive scene of their own entertainment,
after empowering Morgan to settle all
details. It would be unfortunate if this
disposition be made of their subscrip
tions as there is another fund controlled
by the representative committee of the
American society and started after the
exchange of communications with Lord
Esher and the king. These two funds
ought to be amalgamated and used ex
olusively for the erection of a distinctly
American memorial to the queen, de
signed and executed by an American
sculptor.
Englishmen do not want Americans
to help them out on paying for their
memorial. They prefor to have a dis.
tinctive American tribute, without any
connection with the Mansion House.
The king was consulted on this point
and acquiesced.
RIDDLED WITH BULLETS.
A Negro Attempted to Interfere With
the Arrest of Another Negro Shot.
Guntersville, Ala., June 23.-Trouble
that has been brewing between the
negroes and whites for some time cul
minated in the death of Clebe Mont
gmery, a negro who was riddlel with
Winchester bullets, said to have been
fired by Tump Vaghan, a white farmer.
The immediate cause of the shooting
grew out of the arrest of several negro e
charged with burning a barn in the
neighborhood. Montgomery attempted
to interfere with the arrest with the
above result. The barn said to have
been burned by negroes as a manifesta
tion of their displeasure towards the
