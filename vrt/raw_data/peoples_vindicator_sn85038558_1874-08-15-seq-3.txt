RED RIVER IN LINE !

500 DETERMINED CITIZENS MEET!
COMPLETE DESIRTION PROM THE RADI'

CAN'T SWALIOW M. H. TWITCIELL i
AS A "REFORMER."
We had the pleasure of attending
the largest meeting of citizens ever
held in the parish of Red River, on
Thursday, 6th inst., and were truly
gratified with the results. Our sister
parish has suffered in silence and
tears, the outrageous presence and
plunder of the Carpet-baqrer Twitch.
ell and the burglar Dewoes, and be
tween the two she has been left in
utter beggery.
But the hour is at han, and in the
mighty upheavel of the people's
movement, the citizens of Red River
have shown themselves well worthy
of the proud distinction of American
freemen. Over five hundred of her
true and tried sons werfepresent, and
participated in the meeting, and a
perfect organization of the parish was
effected. D6legates were elected to
attend the 'Conventions to nominate
State, District, Senatorial and Con
gressional candidates. Col. W. I8.
Jack ae old war horse from our par
ish, addressed the meeting in one of
his happy and stirring efforts, and
his speech was received with the ut
most enthusiasm. All the Republi
cans in the parish, except the Carpet
bag element, and our Supreme Knight
of the While Camelia, Judge Pe'nny,
who, taken all in all is a very small
coin, and isaunurreat with alliclasses;
joined in the great reform movement
and proelaimed themselves white men
in the true sepae of the word. The
cant of reform, with M. H. Twitchell
as its head, exponent, don't go down
with them, and they believe with us,
that no. hope of an honest govern
ment, a government for all classes
exists outside of the native white
citizen of Louisiana. .
Red River will win this time cer
tain, for her people have become
tired of conciliation and compro
mise, and are determined to act upon
the patriotic and high ground of hon
orsble lirinciple, and that in itself is
half the battle. Dewees and Twitch
ell and such ilk, are not ,the fit poli
tical associates of the gentlemen of
that parish, and their motives in com
promise can only be me1dinary. Fel.
low-citizens of Red River parish stand
together as omB man, put he honest
and espable ticket of representative
white men in the field, the colored
citizens will come to your nsistance
certain, for he can see no hope in the
promisees of Radical plunderers who
are bent only upoa securing their own
ends. Let no 'jiower ~ri ent ,on

PLANATIONS BURNED.
THE M0s a AUtrrIn UL WOM, TO BE AP
PROPJAuTED BY THE NGROES.
New Iberia, Aug.'7, 1874
A dreadful plot of the negroes has
just been discovered here to kill the in'
habitants and to set fire to the residenceg
and plantations in the parish of St. Mar
tilin.
The facts were disclosed by a letter
which was handed to a prominent white
gentlemain by a Republican, who vouch
es for the truth of the statement it con
tains.
The plan was to commence killing and
burning at the Lestrapes place and con
tinue their wirk of rapine add matler
as far as St. Martineville.
A recommendation is made in the let
ter to set the plantations on fire, in or
der tolind where money could be found.
The negroes were to keep for them
solves the most beautiful women and the
parties who were to be killed were men
tioned by name.
As Mon as the criminals aseertained
that their horrid plane were discovered,
they del the parish in hot haste.
The Featest exoitement' prevails, and
the pecile are thoroughly aroused and
deteraned to discover and bring to
punishnent the villains who have medi
tated tlis dreadful massacre and pillage.

We hipe the above will satisfy all par

unite in the selection of its delegates,
surely that Convention will fully re
present their views and wishes. Here,
then, we Aind a Convention called by
certainly the meat powerful, ancient
and best disciplined party in the
State, whee doors are so widely
thrown open that opponents of Pad.
icalism in Louisiana may enter and
express their will...
But the address further says :
"Recent dissensions among our
people, and a deep and abiding de
sire to unite all the elements opposed
to Radicalism, admonish us not to
risk everything upon our own isolated
and unaided efforts; although, in
this emergency, duty prompts us to
exert ourselves as if we were depend
ent upon our sole resources."
And again : "Therefore, forgetful
of past differences, and casting from
our breasts all heart-burnings, let
there be a cordial union of All the con
servatives of Louisiana.
"The Democratic party has no en
mities to gratify, and holds out the
hand of fellowship to all those who
are disposed to aid us in this crisls.
National politics are subordinate nlu
this canvass. The vital issue is re
demption from a corrupt State Gov
ernment and local misrule."
Can any Conservative within the
State refuse to meet and confer with
men breathing a spirit like this f The
Committee of Seventy indorsed that
address. It saw in it an opportunity
-the best, perhaps, that could be af
forded-for union and lagmony.
It thought from the call itself that
the proposed Convention was to be
a convention of all the conservative
people of Louisiana, in which all op
ponents of Radicalism, of negro so
ptemnacy and of the Kellogg usurpa
tion could give full and free expres
sion to their views. This committee,
entertaining this view, could see no
use in holding two conventions. It
therefore indorsed the Democratic
call. It afterwards requested the
Democratic Central Committee to
change the .place for holding the Con
vention to Baton Rouge, which was
promptly and patriotically done. This
was asked solely for the sake of har
mony-as a mere matter of conces
sion to the wishes of some of our
brethren of the country.
And now to that Convention we in.
vite and urge you to come. What
matter under whose auspices it is
called ? True thl there is objection
on the part of sotne of the Democrat.
ic name. Let such remember that:
the Democratic party is a grand na
tional organization ; that upon its arm
hangs our sole hope for the bve'throw
of the national Republican party;
that it has been fighting our battles
when we have been powerless and
voiceless, and that to-day, in its grand
onslaught oa the wavering lines of
Radicalism i all the States of the
Union, its isret battle cry is "Re
member outraged and wronged Louis
iana."
But remember, you who ish,, in this
campaign, to discard all party mames,
that all the vters of the State who are
opposed to the existing uswrpation, are
invited, withoit reference.to party aff
