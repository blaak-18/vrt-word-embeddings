A DEPARTURE PROM CUSTOM Carroll Watson 'Rankin
“Say, you don't want me to save
you a turkey, do you?” asked Jabe
Peters, more than half jokingly, as
little Mrs. Bolton opened her door in
response to his knock.
“You know very well I don’t,” re
plied the trim, elderly lady, in crisp,
decisive tones. “What could I do
with a turkey, when there’s only two
of US?”
“Didn’t know but you was expect
in’ company for Thanksgivin’,” ex
plained Jabe, with a half-foolish tit
ter. “Well, I be goin ’. But if
yon do need a turkey—”
“Well, I sha’n’t,” returned Mrs.
Bolton, with emphasis and convinc
ing brevity.
The little old lady returned to her
seat beside the broad sitting room ta
ble, seemingly to resume the occupa
tion that Jabe had interrupted. Five
sheets of paper were laid side by side
in orderly fashion; five envelopes
were directed to five different ad
dresses, five pink stamps in a neat,
precise row were waiting to be at
tached.
“Jimmy,'’ said she, suddenly
reaching for the envelopes and tear
ing them into bits, “I’ve changed my
mind. I’m not going to invite those
children to come home. I’m done.”
“But, (Sarah —” expostulated Mr.
Bolton, a small’ bright-eyed man of
slender build.
“Yes, I know, Jimmy. For eight
years—ever since Jimmy, Junior, was
married—l’ve sat down at this ta
ble two weeks before Thanksgiving
and asked those children to come
home for at least that one day. And
not one of them has ever come.”
“But, mother —”
“Ob, I know, Jimmy, they’ve been
good about asking us to visit them—
and even sending money for our tick
ets-—but that isn’t what I want. I
want them all here, under my own
roof and sitting at my own table,
and I sha’n’t be satisfied —or thank
ful—till I have ’em; so there, Jim
my Bolton!”
“Why, mother!”
‘ ‘ Mother, indeed! ’’ sputtered in
dignant Mrs. Bolton. “If you were
a mother instead of just a father,
maybe you’d know how it feels to
ask your own children home to visit
■—and get refused. Any excuse seems
good enough for William and Edward
to offer, and Sallie and Julia and
Jimmy, Junior, are not much better.
Here’s Margaret Bruce, with two
married sons and one married daugh
ter coming clear from New York for
that one day. Here’s Mrs. Peter
Lancaster expecting her four. Here’s
Henrietta Parker, ordering two tur
keys to feed all her sons and daugh
ters-in-law. And here’s us —five chil
dren, five children-in-law, and four
teen grandchildren—eating our holi
day dinner by our two lone selves.”
“Well, we might have gone to Ju
lia’s, or to William’s, or to —”
“No, sir—not while I’m (Sarah Bol
ton. Why, William’s wife doesn’t
know what a good, old-fashioned
Thanksgiving dinner is! They eat in
a restaurant. And Julia puts sage
in her dressing, instead of summer
savory. ’ ’
“But, Sarah, I guess I’d write,
anyway. It doesn’t seem just right
not to. Maybe they’ll expect it and
be disappointed. ’ ’
“I’ve written for eight years —and
that’s all the good it’s done. No,
Jimmy, I sha’n’t write, and you
needn’t, either. I suppose I’m not
the right kind of a mother. If I
were, maybe they’d want to come.”
“Nonsense! There never was a
bettor mother, and you know it, Sa
rah. You were too good, if anything.
It's just their thoughtlessness. You
see, they weren’t more than half
grown up when they married, and we
wore moderately young folks our
selves then.”
“Y’es,” admitted Mrs. Bolton, “if
isn’t as if we were really old and
feeble like the Bruces. But just the
same, Jimmy, I feel downright slight
ed and hurt. For once, I’m going to
see how a little wholesome neglect
works. Maybe, by next year, they’ll
discover that this worm has turned.”
The Boltons lived in a roomy, old
fashioned but comfortable house. It
was much too large for their needs,
but the solitary couple, firm in the be
lief that some day all their scattered
children and grandchildren would ac
quire the habit of flocking home for
long visits, could not bear to part
with the old place. And, as Mrs. Bol
ton had said, although they were no
longer young in years, they were cer
tainly anything but feeble.
Mrs. Bolton put the five postage
stamps carefully away. Then, with
a defiant toss of her neat gray head,
she began setting the table with her
very best dishes. It was evident that
she was in a decidedly unusual frame
of mind.
“Why, Sarah!” remonstrated mild
Mr. Bolton, “this isn’t Sunday.”
“I don’t care if it isn’t!” declared
the little old lady, with the reckless
ness of a naughty child. “I don’t
care if I do break a plate or a cup.
I’ve been saving those dishes —there’s
just exactly enough to go around
when all the folks come —for eight
years. But if nobody’s coming to
eat off ’em, I’ll eat off ’em myself.”
The best silver, likewise, was ex
tracted from its usual hiding-place.
Even the precious solid silver teapot
was dragged hastily from its canton
flannel covering.
“I don’t care,” asserted Mrs. Bol
ton, defiantly, “if burglars do get it.
As for the forks, what’s the use of
two dozen, when there’s only two
folks to use ’em? And here’s these
five napkin rings, marked with the
children’s names, that I’ve polished
up every November for eight years —
they can just stay black, this time.
I hope the burglar will take those.”
“Sarah’s in a bad way,” mused
little old Jimmy Bolton. “If she
were a man, now, I s’pose she’d work
it off splitting wood —maybe cussin’
a little. But since she ain’t, she’s
taking it out on her dishes —Golly!
She’s dropped a plate!”
“There!” exclaimed Mrs. Bolton,
with an air of grim satisfaction.
“There ain’t enough <;f those plates
left to go round, and I’m glad of it!”
“S'rah! You didn’t do it on pur
pose?”
“No, I didn’t! Those plates cost
forty cents apiece, and you know
very well, Jimmy, that I’m no waster
<sl)e Jeffersonian
of money. But I guess I did set it
a mite too close to the edge. 1— 1
was thinking.”
Mrs. Bolton’s thoughts for the next
two weeks were hardly happy ones.
Everything at home reminded her of
her neglectful children, selfishly ab
sorbed by their own new interests or
busily engaged jn the pursuit of
wealth. It was even worse when the
little woman walked abroad, for,
wherever she went, she found people
preparing to entertain Thanksgiving
guests. Other mothers of absent chil
dren went about with shining eyes-
their grown up babies and married
boys and girts were coming home!
Other housekeepers were stoning rais
ins, making mincemeat, and imploring
the village grocer to order a large
supply of this or that dainty against
the coming of the day of special
thanksgiving. Other elderly couples,
forgetting that they had none too
many left to their score, were eagerly
scratching days from their calendars
and gleefully counting the few that
were left. Only the deserted Boltons
had nothing to expect from the ap
proaching holiday.
In her unhappy frame of mind, it
was misery for Mrs. Bolton to go to
church, and agony to listen to the
chalter at the sewing-circle, where all
conversation seemed to hinge on the
same painful topic—guests for the
final Thursday in November. As for
dull-witted Jabe Peters, who stopped
in every day or two to ask if she’d
changed her mind about ordering a
tmkey, Mrs. Bolton fairly grew io
hale the very sight of him. The tnr
kev, she was certain by this time, was
absolutely the most detestable of
birds.
“Jabe,' said she, goaded to des
peration, “if I ever want poultry
from you, I'll send for it. Don’t you
waste another minute coming to this
house. ”
About a week before Thanksgiving,
Mr. Bolton returned from the post
office with a letter from Jimmy, Ju
nior. It was evident that young Jim
my had awakened to the fact that, for
the first time in eight years, his
mother had not asked him home for
the November feast.
“ Anything wrong?” wrote Jimmy,
in his brief, businesslike way.
1 ‘ I guess you'd better write to Jim
my,” suggested Mr. Bolton, gently.
“You’d better guess again!” snap
ped little Mrs. Bolton.
But her husband noted with satis
faction that she preserved the letter.
“If she’d been her very maddest,”
he mused, “she’d have torn it up.”
Then Sallie, the busy mother of
many little children, wrote: “Any
body sick? Do take good care of
yourselves and come to see us when
you can.”
Then letters from William and Ed
ward and Julia came in a bunch.
“If you’d invited us,” wrote Ju
lia, playfully, “we really might have
managed to leave home this time, for
business is slack in Robert’s depart
ment, and f( r once all the babies are
well. But since yon didn’t —”
“Os course, you'll telegraph right
away and ask Julia, now,” said Mr.
Bollen, who possessed a warm affec
tion for his lively, eldest daughter.
“There’s still time for her to make
her plans.”
“Os course I won’t!” declared
Mrs. Bolton, hardening her heart.
“If I can’t have ’em all, like other
folks, I’m not going to have any.
I’d rather be an old maid than the
mother of five neglectful children.”
“Why, Sarah!”
“Well. I should. They know that
1 ’ve planned for years to have them
all here at once. They know about
those napkin rings. They know why
we’ve stayed in this big barn of a
house instead of moving into a small
er one. They know I’d like to pull
that extension table out as far as it’ll
go, and —and use all my best dishes.”’
Mrs. Bolton’s snapping black eyes
suddenly became blurred with tears.
“Now, Sarah —”
“I’m not going to think any more
about it!" declared Mi’s. Bolton, res
olutely swallowing the lump that rose
in her throat. “I'm going to read
‘Dombey and Son,’ right straight
through again.”
It was Mrs. Bolton’s habit to take
to “Dombey and Son” as men take
to drink, whenever she wished to
drown her sorrows. But Mr. Bolton
observed with concern that the book
at which she stared so intently was
not Dickens’, but an ancient and un
readable algebra, which, by reason of
its similar cover, always stood next to
the much-worn set of Dickens’.
“And.” mused worried Mr. Bolton,
“she doesn’t even know that it isn't
‘Dombey and Son.' Deary me! If
1 dared, I’d telegraph every last one
of ’em to come, but she’d never for
give me. 1 've often wished I was a
braver man.’’
“Sarah.’’ he said aloud, “I—l
guess I’ll have to split a little wood.”
So Mr. Bolton relieved his feelings
in his accustomed way, and presently
Mrs. Bolton found solace in “Dom
bey and Son.”
“At least,’’ said she, soothed and
quieted, “I’d rather have Jimmy
than Air. Dombey for a husband.”
The dreaded day came at last, as
even unwanted days will, and in spite
of all Airs. Bolton’s efforts to retard
it.
“But," said she, “I sha’n’t get up
a minute sooner than I have to, and
you sha’n’t, either Jimmy. We’ll
shorten this dreadful day at both
ends. ”
So that was the reason when, at
nine o’clock, there was a furious
pounding at the front door, Air. Bol
ton had to scurry into his trousers
and go hurriedly down to answer the
summons. And then, all of a sud
den, the big front hall was filled with
a confusion of thrilling sounds—at
least, they thrilled the heart of Mrs.
Bolton, as they floated upward. The
thump, thump of many pieces of bag
gage and the music of many voices—
young voices, older voices, familiar
voices, anxious voices—all reached
the rebellious little lady upstairs.
“Is mother ill?” cried Julia.
“Why didn’t she write?” demand
ed William.
“Anybody sick?” queried Edward.
“Where’s mother?” chorused Jim
my, Junior, and Sallie.
