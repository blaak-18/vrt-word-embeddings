ORDER OF EASTERN STARS TO WAR ON
ILLITERACY IN TENNESSEE, SAYS HEAD
Co-operating with a campaign to
raiae the educational standards of
Tennessee, which now ranks forty
fourth among the states, the Order of
the Eastern Star of that jurisdiction
is taking steps to do its part in the
drive. The movement is outlined in
a letter sent by Mrs. Jane Washing
ton Ewing, Grand’ Matron of the
.Grand Chapter of Tennessee, to ev
ery chapter in her jurisdiction and
relayed to every member.
In her letter Mrs. Ewing makes it
clear that while the drive calls for
4eparate organized effort on the part
of her organization, it also calls for
the fullest co-operation not only with
nil other Masonic bodies so engaged,
but with the Parent-Teachers asso
ciation and other forces working for
education in Tennessee.
Among the more ambitious pro
posals of the drive is that of bring
ing education into the fastnesses of
the Tennessee mountains where liter
acy is at an exceedingly low level.
Mrs. Ewing explains the plan as fol
lows.
How are we going to do this work?
When a general wants to win a bat
tle, he carefully co-ordinates his
man-power and co-operates with the
leaders of other bodies or units ot
rioldiers. with the result, that if they
work together, ceaselessly, valiantly
and determinedly, they will win the
battle and gain the front line
trenches.
Masonic Co-ordination
This is what we must do in the
tight for education, as others are do
ing elsewhere —co-ordinate our forces
with those of the Grand Lodge, A. I.
& A. M.. the Royal Arch Masons, the
Knights Templar, and the subordin
ate lodges of the A. F. & A. M. and
co-operate with them in a war upon
illiteracy. Let us help put Tennessee
“over the top” in the matter of edu
cation, and let us first center our ef
forts toward more and far better ru-
ral schools. , , _ .
The outline adopted by Mrs. Ewing
for her campaign, and recommended
to the subordinate chapters in that
state, follows:
1. Each chapter to devote the time
of one of its early stated meetings to
a general discussion of the subject of
education; the Worthy Matron in ad
vance of the meeting to appoint one
or two speakers who can deal with it.
2. At the meeting a special com
mittee on education to be appointed;
the duties of this committee to be.
(a) To ascertain the number of
schools within the jurdisdiction of
S&SCoffeeCe.

(h) The Worthy Matrons to write

Mrs. Ewing closes her letter as
follows:
I want all of the chapterss and all
the members of the chapters, in
touch with the schools. In this way,
we believe the work will develop and
avenues of usefulness suggest them
selves. It is our present ignorance
of the condition of the schools, their
need and their insufficiency, which is
at the root of our troubles.
MUSCATINE KLANSMEN
HEM DR. EVANS TALK
Delegation tioes to Davenport
by Special Car—Enthusi
asm High
(By Staff Correspondent)
MUSCATINE. IA., April 7—A large
delegation of Klansmen w’ent by spe
cial car to Davenport yesterday to
hear the Imperial Wizard, Dr. H. W.
Evans speak on the principles, pur
[>oses and effectiveness of the Knights
r>f the Ku Klux Klan, and without a
single exception, have pronounced it
the most convincing plea for Ameri
can man and womanhood, to rise to
their rightful place, for “the protec
tion of our homes, our schools and
our country.”
Those who have followed him in
his talks and lectures through the
press, have been convinced that he
teaches the principles that are prac
tical and just, to all men. But to
hear him is far more convincing,
and to come in touch with his
personality and magnetism, means
much more.
“He who champions the cause for
righteousness, and everything that is
vital to our religion, our home, our
schools, our government, has entered
a cause that appeals to the best ele
ments in man, and there is no
force of iniquity that can suppress
him,” was the, keynote of the Im
perial Wizard’s address.
Dr. Evans has put in motion a
force that is gathering to itself such
power, that not only America feels
its effect, but ere long the nations ot
the world shall know its power.
All who were present at the meet
ing. have gone out to meet the res
ponsibilities and tasks of the day,
with greater courage and higher pur
poses and purer motives • than ever
before.

TUNNELTON, W. VA., April 7.
Tunnelton Klan, Knights of the Ku

of treatment of a little girl, age 13,
who is suffering from infantile par
alysis. The child has been a sufferer
since birth. Prior to the Klan’s as
sumption of the expense of physi
cians’ care and medicine, the little
girl showed little signs of recovery.
Since she has been accorded a physi
cian’s care, and medicine is avail
able, she is improving nicely, doctors

Up to 1923, 93 large communities had

these being situated on the Pacific

Among other significant achieve

past, by the Waldensians is the
concession made to their church by
the Mussolini government. When the
minister of education decreed that,
as a measure against atheism, the
crucifix should be reinstated in every
school room in Italy, the Waldensians
united in a vigorous protest to the
government. Immediately a supple
mentary edict was issued which de
clared that “the Waldensians will be
free to choose whatever emblem they
wish.” They chose a picture of Jesus
blessing little children.
EOITOR SAYS CLEM
NEWS NEEDED TODAY
(’rime ami Sensation Have No
Place in Country Press,
Association Told
NORFOLK, NEB., April I.—“ Crime
! and sensation have no place in the
country press,” declared Mrs. Marie
Weekes, president of the Nebraska
| Press association and editor of The
Press, a weekly newspaper published
in this city.
The association, at its midwinter
meeting at Grand Island. Neb., adopt
ed a code of ethics establishing the
fundamental written law that will
guide Nebraska newspapers in their
work. The members realize, said Mrs.
Weekes. that public confidence, built
on the reputation for truth, fairness
and wholesomeness is their best as
set.
The American people must know
the truth about American public af
fairs, free from partisan prejudice.
Mrs. Weekes declared. She pointed
to the need of a more intelligent and
interested electorate, and added that
newspaper editors know that their
readers constitute the ruling class of
the nation. She continued:
These readers are a busy people
whose indifference to national af
fairs and whose failure to exercise
their sovereignty makes for the very
weakness in government of which
they complain.
The look to their editor for ex
pert advice in matters of government
and of politics, and they are the real
employer, the real “boss” of the
editorial writer.
But the public is often too easy a
boss, too lax in asserting its author
ity. Yet all of its indifference, all of
its ignorance, serves no excuse to its
employee, the editor, who could and
should serve the news truthfully and
interpret it intelligently.
Mrs. Weekes pointed to the fact
that women are becoming more and
more interested in newspaper work.
She added:
Women, known for their house
cleaning proclivities, are just as much
opposed to the unclean in journalism
as in other things, and, with their
fraters, are constantly enlarging
their newspaper valuations.
Mrs. Weekes also is vice-president
of the Tri-State Editorial associa
tion, including members of the Ne
braska, lowa and South Dakota state
associations, nnd South Dakota state
associations, and according to prece
dent will be elected president at the
annual meeting in Sioux City, lowu,
in September.
In 1920 she was an Independent
candidate for election to the house
of representatives at Washington.
KENTUCKY AND OHIO
PLAN BIBLE READING
Question Up as to Whether or
Not Bible Is Sectarian
Book
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON. D. C., April 7.
Whether or not the Bible is a sectar
ian book, whether or not it may or
may not be read and taught as a part
of public school education, is, appar
ently, a never ending problem in dif
ferent parts of the united States.
Two recent pronouncements cn the
vexed question come from Kentucky
and Cuyohoga Falls, Ohio.
In the Blue Grass state, Governor
Fields has signed the bill, which now
becomes law in ninety days, requiring
the reading of the Bible in the public
schools. The bill in part:
“It is important the common school
children shall have lessons of mor
ality brought to their attention dur
ing their school days.
“The teacher in charge shall read,
or cause to be read, a portion of the
Bible, daily, in every classroom or
session room of the common schools
of the state of Kentucky, in the pres
ence of the pupils therein assembled,
and no child shall be required to read
the Bible against the wish of his par
ent or guardian.
“The failure of any teacher to con
form to this act shall be cause for
the revocation of his certificate in
the manner provided by law.”
The Ohio town sets aside an hour
once a week for Bible teaching. Chil
dren are not required to attend. If
their parents prefer, they may take
music or go to gymnasium during
that hour. Classes in Bible study are
hejd by teachers of different denomi
nations and a child may attend the
one his or her parents prefer. No
marks are given in these classes, but
the time so spent counts in the cur
riculum credits.
In Washington, Pa., an old will,
dated a hundred years ago has been
discovered in which the testator
wrote:
“Item: I give and bequeath to
each of my beloved children a Bible,
to be paid for out of my personal
estate, and by so doing mean to inti
mate to them that it is ten thousand
times more my will and desire that
they should find and possess the pearl
of great price hid in ye field of ye
Scriptures, than enjoy anything else
which I can bequeath to them, or
even ten thousand worlds, were they
composed of the purest gold, and all
brim full of the richest jewels, and
yet be ignorant of the precious treas
ures in God’s work, that are hid
even from the most eagle-eyed and
quick-sighted men that are properly
of the present world.”
Beckley Klan to Build
An Elaborate Klavern
BECKLEY, W. VA., April 7. Swept
out of a home on account of its phe
nomenal growth. Beckley Klan,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. is now
making arrangements to build a new
Klan Klavern. While the move is
still in the embryo stage and no def
inite plans have been worked out, it
is understood that the structure is
to cost several thousand dollars. Fur
ther plans for the erection of the
building will be worked out at the
next meeting of the local Klan, it is
said. It is conservatively estimated
that only about half of the member
ship can crowd into the present meet
ing place.
During the past four months the
Beckley organization has grown
from a “baby Klan” to a pillar of
strength in Klanciom. The rapid
growth was brought about by the
state department of extension, which
recently opened office* here.

zens of Country
(Bureau of I’ublleatlon and I duritlonl
WASHINGTON, 1). C., April 7.
Representative Charles A. Mooney,
of Cleveland, who represents the
twentieth Ohio district in the house
of representative, is out and out
against the Johnson immigration bill
and says so openly. In a letter dated
March 6, 1924, he wrote to one of his
constituents as follows:
“I am just in receipt of your val
ued favor of the Ist, in which you
enclose resolution adopted endorsing
the Johnson bill. Replying, may 1
say that I regard the Johnson bill as
distinctly unfair and un-American. 1
expect to give myself the pleasure of
opposing it when it reaches the
floor.
“Sincerely yours,
“Charles A. Mooney.”
This Ohio constituent sat down and
sent the following hot one back to
his alien congressman: “I am in re
ceipt of your letter of the 6th inst,
and want to say that next November
when you come up for re-election
that I will give myself the pleasure
of votinig against you and so will all
my friends whom I can influence to
do so.”
Some Cleveland Facts
Here are a few nuts for Congress
man Mooney to crack, and they are
gathered from his home city. The
state hospital at Cleveland, according
to Guy Williams, its superindent, and
the Cleveland state hospital is only
one of the many institutions taking
care of large numbers of foreign born
dependents, delinquents, and other
public charges? The state hospital at
Cleveland has over 1900 patients, each
one of which costs the Ohio taxpayers
$l9O per year, or $364,000 annually.
About one-third of a million of dol
lars in these days of crushing taxes
for the good people of Ohio to pay
for the maintenance of only one hos
pital that merely takes care of the
social inadequates in only one of its
its big cities.
Will Mr. Mooney take a look at the
individuals in that institution. Over
50 per cent of them are foreign born.
The same statistics are true of othter
state hospitals over the country.
Just think of it, foreign countries
must be literally dumping their
weaklings u|K>n us to spread here
their European and oriental diseases,
and we have to foot the bill. For
years our immigration doors have
been wide open and our foolish gen
erosity and hospitality naturally has
been taken advantage of. What a re
ceptacle for Europe’s trash and Con
gressman Mooney’s home town has se
cured its share in one hospital.
Here are a few more thinks for
Mr. Mooney. The city of Cleveland
is less than 24 per cent foreign born,
yet its state hospital has 1900 in
mates and over 50 per cent of them
are foreign born. See where our in
sane and despendents come from-
About 11 per cent of the entire pop
ulation of the big state of Ohio is
foreign born, but when you get into
the hospitals you find half of them
are foreigners.* Mr. Mooney can well
afford to ponder over these figures.
Proud of Foreign Birth
When these foreign born go into
the state institutions provided for
persons unable to pay for their ow r n
care and keep, the vast proportion of
them brazenly and boastfully an
nounce their foreign citizenship and
declare they have an easier time get
ting along as such than they would

Ku Klux Klan News
Notes From Kankakee
KANKAKEE, ILL., April 7.—Kan
kakee Kluxers are preparing to ele
vate fiery crosses now adorning
the top of their Klavern here twenty
feet higher so it may be seen to bet
ter advantage from surrounding
towns.
A team of Klanswomen from Wat
seka came up last Thursday evening
and assisted in putting on the work
for a large class of Kankakee wom
en. The women’s organization in
this city has a wonderful
and great things are predicted far
them.
Last Friday night the Kankakee
Klan naturalized one of the largest
classes of men in its history and
great satisfaction is felt all over the
country by the way men and women
are hastening to become 100 percent
Americans.
have if naturalized. As alnn they
have ail the rights and privileges of
citizens and none of the duties or
obligations. Its the good pld Buckeye
farmers, laborers and patriots who
are paying the bill and the aliens are
being cared for when they can’t take
care of themselves.
The present governor of Ohio is
about to have a whole lot to say one
of these days about economy and tax
reduction for he is about to run
again for public office. One way to
economize and to reduce taxes in
Ohio is to deport every last one of
those alien foreign born physical and
mental defectives. Our immigration
laws for more than a score of years
has made its unlawful for an insane,
epileptic, feeble-minded, or other
wise physically or mentally defective
foreigner to enter this country.
Practically every one of the fore
ign born insane in Ohio asylums, ev
ery one of the epileptic in the Ohio
institutions for epilepsy, every one of
the feeble minded, in fact all defec
tives, delinquents and degenerates
are foreign born and here unlaw
fully and ought to be shipped back to
Kussia, Italy, Greece or elsewhere
from whence they come.
There is another way to lessen
their expense and that is to get in
behind the Johnson immigration bill
and lessen the number of foreigner*
being dumped on our shores and up
on the backs of the local taxpayers..
Look at New York
Governor A 1 Smith, of New York, is
right now pressing the federal gov
ernment to reimburse his state treas
ury to the extent of $17,000,000 for
the care and keep of tens of thou
ands of aliens not promptly deport
ed by Uncle Sam. That’s an eye
opener in itself.
