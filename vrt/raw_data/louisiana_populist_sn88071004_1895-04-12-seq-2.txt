SOCIALISM.
Socialism--A theory of society
which advocates a more precise,
orderly and harmonious arrange
ment of the social relations of man
kind than that which has hitherto
prevailed.--Webster.
No thinking man will controvert
that associated industry is the most
powerful agent of production, and
that the principle of association is
susceptible of further and benefi
cll development.-John Stuartj
Mill
"I conceive the establishment of
a national bank dangerous to the
saifety and welfare of the Repub
lic."-IIenry Clay.
.....----e . -- ... .
"The government should issue
all the currency that is used by the
people, whether it be gold, silver
or paper, and should be made a le
:;il tender for all debts, public and
.1rivate."-Peter Cooper.
Carnegie, just back from "Yur
rap," is out in an interview on the
business situation which he pro
nounces "convalescent." It won't
stay that way long, however, if the
services of Dr. Carnegie and other
such physicians as believe in bleed
ing as the only remedy are not dis
pensed with.-Nonconformist. i
What a funny idea that was of a
two or three men that they could 9
catch the whole Populist party, t
like a bull calf by the tail, and
swing it over their heads into any ,
camp they pleased. Still funnier, (

Editor LOUISIANA PoPULurr:
In so much discussion of the
merits and demerits, advantages
and disadvantages of monometal
ism and bimetalism, respectively,
it seems to me that we are beating I
about the bush; we are creating a
I great shell to knaw away in order
toget at a very small kernel.
I To one informed of a course of I
our financial policy and legislation
since the outbreak of the civil war i
the reason of the demonetization
I of silver is too evident to want
elucidation.
In 1862 Mr. Chase, the then
secretary of the treasury, said, in
speaking of the National Banking
act. "The central idea of the
measure is the establishment of a
sound, uniform currency through
out the country upon the founda
tion of national credit, (in other
words upon a national debt) mak- I
'ig this the settled policy of the1l
country."
Four years later, Mr. McCul
loch satd, "The National Banking "
system was intended, while not I
invading the rights of the States, I
nor dagmng private interests, to
rnis th. people with a peru.
aeit paper e.Ircttaiou," C

that the mtma~a was to perpetu
a thei debt and the bonds.
It was sever dreamed that this
couatry would so soon recover

of the bliom of debt heaped upon
When was diuevered that we

the zenius of John Sliherman came
into play. T'hrough his Inanipula
tions, first as chairman of the Sena
ate finance committee-then as
secretary of the treasury, silver
was demwonetized and coin constru
Sed to mean goid, and so bonds that
Y originally co.-t 641c on the dollar

Some Wants Made Known.
KINDER, Lt., March 13, 1891.
LAKESIDE REVIEW.
I see that the plutes want to di
vide the P'eople's party or Pops
and shut one part of us off into a
,, free silver party to have us in two
parts so it will be the easier to out
vote us. Now I do not want to be
sold out in that "wy. I think if so
Ssold, I should refuie to be de
livered.
d Speaking of wants, I want many
things of a political nature. Please
give me space in your most valua
ble paper and I will make some of
s them known.
; I want to abandon our present
d complicated method of spelling. I
r would have it done phonetically.
Then eliminate our compound num
t bers from the arithmetics, and
r adopt instead, the metrical system,
as the French have it; some shorter
d cuts in sphericel geometry and a
few other changes where they can
t be made for the better.
s I want every citizen, and every

Stand by the Ship !
Editor Nonconformist:
The dying appeal of the gallant t
Lawrence to his men: "Don't give I
up the ship," was not more touch- q
ing in its earnestness than the cry
of the rank and file of the Peo
ple's party to-day to their Reform
Press: "Don't give up the Omaha
platform." Surrender not one jot
or tittle of the second and greater
declaration of independence.
There is not ademand in it which t
free and self-respecting people
should not have enacted into law.
Stand by the Omaha platform as it
is, ye gallant editors of the Reform t
Press. We, the people, are with l
you. a

IIELL, January 927, 1M,. .
To the Preachers of the United
States:
My lDear Fellows: HavIe a piece
iof chicken. 'Ihel( lordl lless von.
May you alwaCs have plenty of
s chicken. May you grow fat and
'"eat, drink and be merry." I
o write this letter to you in all confi
tl dente. I hope it will not be pub- I
e lished. If it don't get into the
, "'Buzz-Saw" we are safe. It beats
the devil how much that "Buzz
Saw" nman knows about my busi
y ness on earth. If there were many
c such papers there I would have to
- fold my tnt and iro Ito sline other
if planet. I: :i'!l roe chikenl. Now
to be)simi :. Thiings anre all rii.rht
t up h'": '. T' "'lake of lrl.ir:.:- e"
I is r.I lhit and seethil:. "Th- i.
no j,,k 1. lave another pice of
chicken. A-; you know, illy lot
t has been cst on hard lines ,ince I
,9 was kicked out of Heaven. You I
t will never know just how I felt I
1 until it comes your turn. An an
gel one day and a devil the next.
Of course I had to start from the
ground. I never even had a change
of clothes. I struggled along un
til I got a little hell started and
then went dowrn o earth to, enlist I
' recruits. Of course you have read I
of some of my failures and tri
umphs. When I took Jesus Christ
up on the niountain and tried to
buy him he was awfully hungry.
But he wouldn't sell. Men are
I much better dressed now-a-days t
and are cheaper, too. I have thou- I
sands of men workirrg for me' for i
their hoard and clothes. Of course
r you ministers are not all working i
for nme but most of vou are not do- c
ing me much harm. As klo as I
you can attract the people's att :n
tion to the church and its doctrines, a
they won't think much about Chris- t
tianity. Every time one of you I
preaches a doctrinal sermon I occu
py a front seat and join in the
amens. Just keep up that lick.
There is this difference beticen
Churchianity and Christianity; one
gently leads people to bell, while
the other directs them to Heaven.
All hail to Churchanity! Since
the preachers have begun to preach
doctrinal sermons and holding joint A
debates, and the politicians began
to talk tariff, I have had easy sail- F
ing. Now allow me to give you a
little advice. I have been in the i
service much longer than you. ,
Talk Churchianity and Charity,
and let Christiamty and Justice
take care of themselves. The peo
Sple would rather wrangle over the Y
question as to whether they should
be soused clean under the water
(which, by the way, is very un
pleasant and undignified), or just ¶
have a little sprinkled on their bare
heads. As far as I'm concerned it
makes no difference, I can get
them one way as well as the other. A
I depend' upon you preachers to
keep up these dissensions among i
the different churches. You all
have plenty of Scripture to do it.
I think the less you say about
Christ and his teachings the better. F
Of course you all know he was a
tramp and a Sodalst. Besides he A
was old-fashioned and his clothes
never fit him good. If he wason
earth now he would not be permit
ted to enter most of your first-class T
ehurches~ He was always hrping
about bypocrits, and lawyers; and
even went so far one time as to p
mset theim tables of the money-chang- F
ers sand soouarge them out of the
temple. For this reason he was
always unpopular, cooud never coin'
mand any salary, or stay atone
place long. Finally be became so
unpopular with the big men who
wore fine clothes and had the mot
ey, that they had him killed. You
ought to take warning by theseh
things. If you want to fourish C
like a green ay tree don't take Je- ft
sum Christ as an examplo. Myron L
Reedtrisd it, and so did Botkin.
Thny ar now out of a job. Never

I and hungry. You wisl C~rt : thy'
credit for dividing th; soup a:1i it
s won't interfere with your alarv.
1 Don't tell the people that interest
is a new name for an old sin. Try
to make thetm believe it is some
1 thing different. Have some more
chicken. Keep up a big clatter on
u church doctrine. By doing so you
- will make a big reputation for
yourself, get your salary increased,
and not interfere with the business
lnithods of the members of your
congregation. Let every mian wor-I
1 ship (od according to the iictatoer,
(If his own conscience, and do bm
siness after his own methtods. aavc
Ssolle more chicken. Now I see no
reason why we should not work
f right along together. I will help
1 you build the churches. You put
up the church and I will decorate
it and put in the finery. I will al
so pay half your salary. I can af
ford to do it. The members of
your churches help to support my
saloons, bawdy houses, and gamlb
ling' dens, known as Boards of
Trade. I want to be generous.
Preach against the sins of the poor.
[Theyohave no influence. )on't
hurt the feelings of the rich. They
.are my best customers and your
most generous paymasters. Wher
ever I can find a man or woman
hungry I have got a sinch on him
or her. That is the reasoin I want
you to feed them soup. It will
F keep them from dying long enough
for me to get in my work, but it
will not satisfy hunger. When a
I laboring man or woman talklabout
t justice and human rights, call them
anarchists. This will set all the
big dailies against them and the
courts will issue injunctions and
then put them in jail. In conclu
sion let me tell you something that
you do not know. God is watch
ing the people, but he is not watch
)ing you fellows. He has delegated
that task to me--the first thing he
has ever asked me to do since he
kicked me out of Heaven. Now I
won't be hard on you fellows. I
want you to have a g.d tihm.
Stay in either the DeInocratic or
Republican party-I don't care
which. Have another piece of
chicken: Don't go off into any of
these Reform parties. They give
me more trouble than all the
churches put together. In fact it
is Christianity orn kIe and in mo
tion, and is very dangerous to my
interests. Don't you fellows monk
ey with it. You might get killed
like Christ did, or lose your jobs
like Myron Reed and J. D. Bot
kins did. Have some more chick
en. Now, good bye. I may write
to you again in a short time. Don't
let the "Buzz-Saw" man get onto I
this)etter. The next time I write
I will address the courts of the
United States.
Yours fraternally,
SATAN DEVIL.
