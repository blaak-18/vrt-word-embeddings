THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE,
AND A FEW LACONICS
NEW YORK’S EXPERIENCE WITH
A VERY BRAVE MAYOR.
.W YORK has long figured
j,s one of the most expen
sively run municipalities
in the world.
The word “graft,” as applied to
politicians with sticky palms and no
consciences, originated there, and the
loot of the grafters has been large
and continuous.
Next to rottenness in her building
commission (which permitted of
every known variety of graft), the
police department of New York city
was the most expensive, shameless
and popular branch of the munici
pality.
The man who applied for a posi- ■
tion on New York’s police force had
to undergo some instruction not
down in the book issued by the po
lice commission.
He had to learn fearsome and
wondrous things of “the man higher
up.” He had to be drilled in the
code of morals which made one man
immune, while it netted another ar
rest and a fine.
He had to distinguish the differ
ence between the levy he was to ex
act from one who wouldn’t pay for
protection and the sum expected
from one who did.
All these and various other things
the would-be policeman had to learn.
And he paid a good, stiff price in
cash for the privilege of learning
them.
The efficacy of the force, even
though it was the most elaborate
and ornate of any in the country, has
been questioned often by the New
Yorkers, as well as by the country at
large.
Investigation, shake-up, transfers,
dismissals and reduction in ranks
have all been tried time and again
by the police commissioners, but the
service seemed to improve only tem
pararily.
And the secret of it was this: Tam
many ruled the police department as
absolutely as the Czar ruled Russia.
There was a system of “fees”
which began with the exacting of
payment for “special privileges.”
This phrase, when freely interpreted,
meant blackmail by the police for
violation of police laws.
Keepers of gambling houses and
houses of ill repute paid so much per
week to the captain of a precinct who,
in turn, paid in so much to the ward
leader of Tammany. New Yorkers
knew this, and they knew the effect
it had on the members of their police
force.
They knew that, in spite of all
regulations and rules could do, the
police machinery was too cumber
some and too clogged by political
handling to permit the capture of the
criminal in more than one in five
murder cases. Petty criminals were
caught by the dozens, were arraigned
and convicted, but the big despera
dos got away.
. And when New York’s new mayor
took stock of what he had on hand
in the shape of police officials, he
found some cumbersome ones that
he intends to dispense with.
The office of “police commission
er” was at one time one of the best
gifts Tammany had to bestow; and
the manner of man who sometimes
filled it was explainable only on the
ground of “influence.”
Whatever else Mayor "Gaynor may
be, he is possessed of a bravery
which even his enemies must admire.
Going in to office largely on the
support of Tammany, he has dared
disapprove of the methods of that
great organization, and is honestly
trying to give New Yorkers an ad
ministration free from “party poli
tics.”
In other words, unless a man who
is a candidate for office can show
some real fitness for that office, he is
not appointed.
Tammany has gasped many times
at the unceremonious manner in
which Mayor Gaynor has “turned
down” would-be office-holders whose
only bid for appointment was that
they were prominent in Tammany’s
circle.
The dismissal of Police Commis
sioner Baker and the expressed pur
pose of the mayor to conduct that
office himself, augurs well for New
York’s police department.
There are other municipalities
graft-ridden, maladministered and
maladorous with machine politics
which might benefit largely by the
upheaval in New York, and there
may be other Gaynors who will be
glad to undertake it Jf they can be
assured the support of those who are
tired of municipal rottenness.

’Nother preacher gone wrong;
Rev. John Gray, of Laporte, Ind.,
swiped S4OO of church funds, left a
wife and some children and took a
young lady from his flock with him
when he left for parts unknown.

As a weather prognosticator the
groundhog has lost caste. It may be
the comets have upset the usual rules
and regulations by which the ground
hog calculated, but it’s a certainty
he missed connections for this year’s
weather.

In view of the fact that long, ex
pensive trials often come to nothing
because of the work of the “jury
fixer”, wouldn’t it be a good idea to
look into the modus operandi of the
“fixer” and do a little side investi
gation on the “fixed”?

My, my; here’s that little South
American war going on yet, but
most of us have been so busy hear
ing about the meat trust, the egg
trust and the milk trust, and worry
ing because the grocer won’t trust,
we’ve had no time to look it up.

As depopulators of the human
family, the Italian Black Hand So
ciety and the Chinese High Binders
don’t leave much room for choice.
And the “open door” policy of im
migration in the United States has
permitted about all of these gentry
that this country wants to enter.

You never can tell what a

jury will do; one man had to pay
S3OO for killing a boy with his auto
mobile, and another paid SSOO for
knocking the teeth out of an old
man. This happened in tight-wad
Connecticut, so we may assume fu
nerals are cheaper than false teeth.

An Atlanta preacher has intro
duced the baby show, with money
prizes, as a means for getting people
to the 11 o’clock morning service.
And there are still some old-fash

for the Word of God to be preached
in.

Good roads are the right of every
man who pays taxes and lives out
side the cities. With good roads the
problem of transportation of food
products to the consumer is solved,
and the farmer doesn't have to share
his profiit with so many.

Any sober, honest, industrious
man who is inveigled into marrying
a girl with blue eyes, a blonde pom
padour and a pretty figure, but who
doesn’t know which end of a kettle
the water comes out of, should sue
the girl’s mother for wilful negli
gence of her offspring.
v
New York city may point with
pride to her magnificent municipal
debt; it has reached the sum of
$946,005,728. Next to ready money,
good credit brings a lot of luxuries
to some folks, and the chances are
Tammany’s maw has swallowed some
of the money represented.

Uncle Sam has some peculiar ideas
of economy. On board the United
States warship North Carolina, eight
hundred men (w’hite, black and one
Filippino) drink out of two cups
which are kept on deck. An epidemic
of tonsilitis has broken out among
the men and can be traced directly
to the use of these two cups, as they
are never disinfected.

Washington, D. C., had a for-men
only clothesfest, and the elect who
were bidden to view the array of
frock-coats, cuffed trousers, fancy
“weskits” and - button - all-the-way
down shirts say the display was
grand. Since men broke into the
sartorial class with women, there’s no
knowing where the dress mania will
lead them.

A very wealthy Missouri family
named Swope was being killed off
in a most most Medici manner by
the skillful application of typhoid
fever germs in their food, placed
there by a relative who was anxious
for the money. Thus did Science
unwittingly become expensive to the
life insurance neople, and an aid to
the undertaker.

It is a long step for the Belgian
King to take when he declares he
will improve the conditions in the
Congo when Leopold had made
millions of money out of his rub

cruelties which existed so long is at-

terested in the Congo industry.

The negro Johnson doing stunts :
with white prize fighters, Jap stu

athletes have lost sight of race dis

Parrots and cats have figured as
life-savers lately. Two old maid
sisters had fifteen cats; one old maid
lived alone with a parrot. Fire
broke out in each house. The fifteen
cats yowled all at once and saved
their mistresses’ lives, and the par
rot squawked bravely to the same
end. Let the other bachelor ladies
take, warning.

PLAIN TRUTH
A MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 32 PAGES
By J. A. SCARBORO,
A Son of Georgia, Minister and
Student.
This Magazine is digging up and
exposing corruption and graft in
“Missions”. Its Editor has studied
the subject fifteen years, published
two books on the subject and knows
what he is doing. Dr. J. N. Hall,
late Editor of the Baptist Flag, the
most -widely circulated Baptist pa
per in the South, with whom Scar
boro was associated as Editor of
that paper, said of him: “J. A. Scar
boro is the best informed man on
missions in America.” The cham
pions of the present system have
declined to meet him in both press
and on rostrum. His Magazine is
full of facts, evidence and argu
ments which can not be refuted. He
is Treasurer of the General Asso
ciation of Baptist Churches, and has
the confidence and enjoys the en
dorsement of his brethren. He is
Pastor of one of the best churches
in the land and just in his prime
and in the thickest of the battle for
truth and righteousness.
