DEMOCRAT TALKS.
'"-here's Trouble Ahead for the State De
mocracy, and Lots of It"--"Will Quiet
ly Support a Repubtlican Cindidate"
Under Certain Clrcumstances.
"*There's trouble ahead for the
State Democracy, and lots of it," re
marked a gentleman who is qluite
prominent in southwest Texas politics
to the Express correspondent.
"What is its I will tell you, !ro
vided you won't publish my name.
You see, I am chairman of the bound
currency committee in my senatorial
district, and it might cause a racket
if I were to cone out just now and
publish my views over rmy name.
*'All my life I have voted theo Dem
ocratic ticket and have stood by the
nominees. even to voting for Miles
('rowley. I'm gettine mighty tired of
this kind of thing and from now on
I'm going to bea mugwump. I am
going to the next state convention
and declare myself, and if they want
to put me out they can do so. In the
first place. I do not propose to vote l
for Charley Culberson under any con- 1
sideration, and should the convention
nominate any other silver man he can i
go to the devil, as far as I am con
concerned. I don't intend to have
free silver crammed down my throat.
and I know thousands, hundreds, any
way, of good Democrats who feel just
as I do about it.
"The party lash has lost its terrors
for me, and hereafter I am going to
support any man I want to, regard- 5
less of his politics. Some people think i
the movement that was started in 1
Houston in 1892 against demagogism !
is dead, but they are mistaken. It b
has really just started good, and the 3
reason we let it slumber last year was
that we might be in better shape to b
apply the knife next year."
"'Then you intend that it shall be 1
'war to the knife' next year against ii
the silver men?"
'"That's what I mean, and it shall
be the -knife to the hilt and a sur
vival of the fittest,' as our blood
thirsty attorney general would say.'"
"You expect then to form a new
party year?"
-Call it what you please, but I
think our side will be the party of
sound Democracy and that the other
wing will be the new party."
")Do you anticipate a split next al
year?"
"I certainly do, and I look for at f1l
least four candidates in the field-a w
Democratcl, a Republican. a Populist as
and a free silver oandidate. fiu
"Then you don't class the silver co
men as Democrats?" lo
"By no means. Our side will com- fil
pose the rank and file of the Democ- m
racy and we don't propose to let the cI
free silverites dictate to us in the con- I
vention."
"You expect, then, to bolt. provid- tr
ed the free silverites are in the as- m
cendcy?" Ni
"No; but we will quietly draw off, c
hold a straight-out' Democratic con- t
veation, nominate a straight ticket
and adopt a platform a decent Demo
crat can stand on."
"Do you speak for all the sound at
currency people?" es
"I only speak for myself, but I
think I voice the sentiment of at least
nlnotean-tweateths of the sound cur.
resny people. I have talked with a or
great many of them the past two me
months, and so tar all of them have aI
expressed themselves as feeling just lis
as I do. We don't propose to take ap
any free silver In ours, and if we fail foi
to hold a convention and nominate a frE
ticket that suits, then we will quietly me
support the Republican candidate for p.
Sgovernor, provided he is a decent
man." c
"How about the other candidates?'" c
"We will pick out the best men
oand they, too, may be Republicaa&" leg
"'How about the congrreuional bus

"That's another question. I don't

as "Sherman Roar took a painful part
X_ in an incident, a star part at that,
i1 which, while grief inspiring in all its
,le phases, couldn't be called a fight. Nor
Id was it exactly with a member of con
io gress, although the foe had close busi
ness relations with the house. Hoar
was very young, and, to his disgust,
very much resembled in personal ap
pearance one of the head pages of the
C house. This head page was a great
r- practical joker, and the butt of much
er of his humor was a sleepy darky who
had charge of the house washroom.
n- This Congo was prone to sit in a chair
al in the washroom and slumber. The
- funny head page would sly up to him
as he slumbered and tip him over on the
. floor. This was a joke. Before the
Id Congo could recover himself for ven
in geance the head page would be back
in the house, beyond whose green baize
o portals no humble black man might
pursue his prey.
"One afternoon the humorous page
tipped over the sleepy colored man sev
eral times. It gave the head page great
joy. The victim of all this fun lusted
n for revenge. He would give a week's
t- salary for an opportunity to play a re
W turn game with his tormentor.
e "It was four o'clock in the afternoon
" when, opening his eyes after a cat nap,
he beheld his persecutor bending over
a wash basin, refreshing his face.
r The bedevilled Congo's joy was uncon
f ined. The Lord had delivered the ene
e my into his hands.
"The negro is not an originator. At
best, he is only an imitator. In this
supreme hour of triumph our poor
black friend could think of nothing
e better than to creep to the unsuspect
ing tyrant and kick him. This he did,
and he threw all the force of his trop
ical nature into the caress. He kicked
the enemy soundly and roundly, and
then stood back to enjoy his victory.
"The force of this rear end collision
drove the victim's head against the
wall with amazing force. It was not
unnatural that he should look up. He
did so, and the darky was horrified
when he recognized the features of f
Sherman Hoar, representative from the
Boston Backbay district. The darky I
did not faint, for the reason that dar- I
kies never faint. But he grew several
shades lighter at the thought of what f
he had done. d
"Hoar, on his part, could not find r
words to express his indignant astonish- s
ment. At last the poor darky managed C
to explain, in the most humble and con- I
trite fashion, that he had mistaken s
Hoar for the head page, who oppressed 8
him. Hoar granted him forgiveness, c
although in his proud heart he regard- s
ed the explanation as a greater insult h
than the assault. After that, too, Hoar c
bathed his face at his hotel. He did I
not care to take further risks in the e
house washroom, for the kick had not
diminished his resemblance to the a
page."

A Traveler's Outfit.
A small "Traveler's Guide," dated n
1780, has just come to hand. It con- n
tains a good deal of advice as to the y
luggage which should be taken. We o
take a few paragraphs from this book- t4
let, leaving our readers to draw their g
own conclusion as to whether a cen- g
tury of travel has improved us in this n
connection. "Take," says the "Guide," ti
"two suits of clothes, one coffee-colored w
and one blue, a chest flannel, a pair of n
leather breeches, a sleeping suit, three Is
pairs of stockings, two pairs of gloves, fi
two wigs, one hair bag (?), two caps, two ir
hate, two pairs of shoes, one pair of of
slippers, six 'undershirts,' four 'over- 8
shirts,' six neckties, six collars, six
handkerchiefs, four pairs of cuffs, three
cravats, two pairs of cotton hose, two
pairs of socks." But this is not all, as p
is shown by the following items: "Take is
a Bible, a book of sermons, a 'Traveler's ol
Guide,' two albums, a diary, a quire of on
white paper, quills and ink, an almanac, 51
a mirror, a silver watch, a silver snuf- it
box, a silver spoon, a pair of silver shoe- as
buckles, a silver tie-pin, three silver as

he The value of the precious metals is
at influenced more by the accumulations
ch on hand than by their anuual product.
ho It may be assumed, and the assuwp
m. lion is sumfeiently accurate for our
Lir purposes, that there is four thousand
he mililons of gold coin in the world,
m If. after making good wear and loss,

ht money duty would be :4 per cent,
which is a larger percentage of in
go crease than it seems possible to ob
v. tain. But such an increase would
at not keep pace with the increase of
td population and business.
's We are told, however, that the in
e_ crease in gold production is such as to
compensate for the demonetization of
i silver and provide for an increase
, equal to the increasing demands
sr growing out of the growth of popula
tion and business. It must be born
in mind that the supply of silver
p money stops with the gold standard,
and that new gold must he found to
,t supply the four thousand millions of
is silver coin. At one hundred millions
a year this would take just forty
years. At the end of forty years, if
the supply of gold could be kept up
bo as to make an annual Increase of
one hundred millions a year of gold
coin in addition to supplying the arts
d and repairing wear and loss, we
would have the same amount
of gold money that we would
now have of coin by the use
e of both gold and silver. l)uring the
At whole period of forty years there
lo would be less money than there is at
d the present time; but at the end of
f forty years we would have as much of
A the one metal as we now have of the
7 two metals, gold and silver. But in
forty years the population and busi
iI ness, if not restrained by a money °
It famine, would be double what it is to
day. With double the demand for 1
d money and without any increase in the C
I- supply, prices forty years hence would
d necessarily be 5U per cent lower than
I- they are to-day. But this favorable
a showing of the future production of
d gold is not warranted by the history
I, of the past or anything within reason
able probabilities in the future. It
t has taken four thousand years to ac
r cumulate the stock of gold in hand. v
d It is hardly possible to accumulate as t
e much gold in the next forty years as c
,t has been accumulated during all the i
a ages. i!
The great placers are substantially n
exhausted. The vein mines of Col
orado and South Africa are wonder- J
fully productive, but they are vein p
i mines, and with modern appliances fi
- must be exhausted within a very few a
a years. The life of a mine, whether a
b of gold or silver, is limited to eight or d
- ten years. After that, gleanings may
r go on almost indefinitely; but the
- great mass of the gold or silver is
° now taken from a vein mine in less tl
than a decade. Figure it out as you ci
I will, if the better and more reliable w
t metal, silver, is discarded and the fr

s Sir Harry Vane!
Who remembers the name? Not
one in a million; yet he was the first
d English statesman who ever distinctly
o. proclaimed the doctrine of liberty of
rs conscience; just as he was the first'
.g statesman who contended that the
I- people should be protected from gov
3- ernment encroachment by a written
s. constitution.
i" This was more than three hundred
- years ago.
We to-day enjoy the fruits of his
thought, his labor and his sacrifice.
For preaching the doctrine that the
Speople were the real rulers and the
government a mere servant of the
people, vested with certain limited
- powers, Sir Harry Vane was tried for
ýl treason, and, in defiance of law, was
condemned to death.
r Here is tho sentence which a venal
a court passed upon him:
-'That he should be hanged, cut
down while living, his body cut open,
r and his bowels burned before his face;,
that his head should be severed from
t his body, and his body cut into four
quarters."
f Out of his tender mercy, his Gra
cious Majesty, King Charles the
Second, remitted all the sentence ex
cept the part which required Vane's
head to be cut off.
Yes, you carelessly enjoy and care
Slessly lose precious rights of self.-gov
ernment which cost your ancesters
their lives to win.
They went gladly to prison, to the
torture chamber and to the heads
man's block, rather than surrender
the principle that the will of the peo
n ple should be the supremn law of the
land.
We, puny and degenerate descend
Seants of the heroes of freedom, calmly
look on while a few masters in the
great money centres 4~ctate our laws
and violate our written constitution;
e and we fold our feeble hands in ab
ject discouragement because our very
first efforts to regain control of the
government are aot crowned with
success.
Miserable cowards that we are. and
we deserve that our bosses should de
spise us, just as they do despise us.
They cut off the head of Vane be
cause he said that God, law and par
liament were superior to the king.
They cat off the head of Sydney be
e cause he wrote that the governed
should have a voice in the goverment.
But they conldn't cut off the head
