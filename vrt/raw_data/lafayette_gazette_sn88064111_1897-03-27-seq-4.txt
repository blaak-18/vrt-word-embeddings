TIYE ISSUE IS CLEAR.
When the present City Council eft
took charge of the municipal affairs co,
of this town the condition of things 9so
which then prevailed was not at all _
satisfactory, but two years of wise
and judicious administration have
brought about a decided change. aft
When the preceding Council went
out of office, there was not enough
money in the treasury to pay out
standing debts and the corporation me
was indebted to a number of citi- Cu
zens. These debts were paid by
the present Council, despite the -
- fact that the revenues during the V
first year of its incumbency were
curtailed neatly one half owing to the
t decision of the Supreme Court -
which prevented the collection of
- taxes from the "additions." By
this decision the town was deprived Si
of nearly half its revenues. But
the "additions" were soon re-incor
porated and it required the same
amount to run the town although
the money collected was far from
being what it was the year before.
We repeat that the Council was
handicapped by this large decrease su
in the revenues of the town; never- i
theless old debts contracted and an
left unpaid by the preceding Coun- hc
" cll were liquidated and all
new obligations were met in th
- regular order. The financial af
- fairs of the corporation have been
administered in a straight, bus;ness
like manner. The proceedings of -
the council published monthly
never failed to show how every
cent collected had been spent, or if J
not expended, where it was. This
t part of the people's business has
I been particularly well attended to.
1 These are facts, cold, stubborn
facts. The books are there to
prove their correctness. The town in
e has been as well lighted as ever be- a,
s fore; the police has been equally as i
good; the streets are in splendid h
y condition; the town owes no one,
- and there is a surplus in the
e treasury of over $rzoo without ir
s counting the amount raised by the ir
collection of the special tax--the tl
last report of the treasurer shows I
$x6oo to the credit of the latter fund. V
How was it under the former
f Council, when the men who want to
get into power, were at the helm?
W, Without wishing to be unnece's
sarily severe, we are compelled to
:s say that the finances of the town
' were in very bad shape. Will any
supporter of the People's ticket
gainsay this? Is it not a fact that
there was a shortage of some seven
hundred dollars, the result of loose
management of the public funds?
There is no use getting excited
n about this thing. The issue is
g clear. It is whether we are going
Is to have a continuance of good mu
it nicipal government or a return to
- the old order of things.
The success of the Democratic
ticket headed by Mr. Charles D.
al Caffery means an intelligent, busi
ness-like administration such as we
have been having under the present
s. Council.
