Compromise.
The questiou between the contest
ing Police Juries of this parish has
assumed the phase of an arbitration
or compromise--tlhe Kelloggites from
.fear of consequences have been more
than anxious to temporise and quiet
our people for some tiume past, but
we ale ill no way anxious to repeat
an experiment with these men the
practicability of which, we have once
demonstrated to our sorrow and cost.
Tn 1873 we llade an adjustment of the
Police Jury, and we are painfully
aiitre of the faith kept by the radi
cal plunderers ot Natchitoches par.
ish on that occasion-the eight per
cent tax is a monument in remem
brance of just such policy, and if re
peated, will result in just the same
state of affairs that called forth the
united efforts of all good men in time
State to put down. There has been
no change in the objects or character
of the radical leaders here or else
where throughout the State--the meo
tive of plunder is still the bond of
union, and no feeling of patriotism
has as yet, nor ever will, penetrate
the dark caverns of their remorseless
ambition-one lesson on this subject
is more than enough to satisfy the
most sceptical of our citizens of the
utter folly of its repetition. What
we claim is just, and the strongest
presumptive evidence of that is, the
fact of a desire to compromise.on the
part of the radicals, for bear in mind
that this proposition comes from
them.
This compromise will only last, as
the last one did, until the Senate re
fuses to confirm the appointees tnder
it, as they did in 1874, and tihe politi
cal keenness, we will not say wisdom,
of our adversaries, teach them that
by that time they may lhare succeeded
in quieting the public pulse so as to
enable them to "put up jobs," as usu
al, with impunity.
Let the whole matter rest with
Kellogg and his followers as regards
both our city and parochial govern
ment; they must be responsible for
all acts for the next two years; no di
vided obligations, if they legislate for
good, which is utterly impracticable
with that class of men, let them en
joy the honor; if bad, then let the
shame rest with that party which has
in the past been so foul a blot upon
our people.
The white citizens are unalterably
opposed to being made part or parcel
of a compromise, no matter of what
complexion, with these thieves in
Natchitoches parishi; the State adjust
ment was bad enough, God knows,
to which they have not yet yielded
assent,'and in future in all affairs of
compromise the white people must
not be considered, for they will not be
bound by it, and should such a meas
ure be effected, the responsibility
must rest solely uspan the individuals
who bring it about, for no one is an
thorized to speak for this people, and
when they do, they at once assume
an unwarranted prerogative, and act
in opposition to the will of the peo
ple of the white party, expressed in
unmistakable language upon more
than one occasion.
We fully . agree with the Minden
Democrat, when it says that the Dem
ocratic press have, for the past few
years, advocated measurbs and politi
cal combinations at variance to the
real opinions. The trouble is with a
number of Democratic editors and
politicians, aioong which it classes
thie .1anner of Bossier parish and its
staff, that they cannot understand
why party should not be the first
thought oi and the first fought for.
They should remember that "the
welfare of the people is the first con
sideration," and when we cannot do
and gain all, we must do what we can,
and take what we get. As for the
"white man's party,' we claim the
advocgey of its principles as true de
moeracy, and are not a little proud of
its record, as it did mro ~ffalas tie de
mocracy has done in hunting for ne.
gro votes for tihe past seven or eight
years.' If the DBmiater expects negro
votes, or hopes to get them by stump
speeches, democratic barbeces, 5e.,
it had better save it.s wind and beef;
for begging, cajoling, and all man
aer of asking, will tof get one of them
to come to our support. The solid
organization of the white people in
1876, and the moral effect had there
by upon the thieves who lead the ig
norant negro, is the only sure way of
redeeming Louisiana. We claim this
as true democracy as opposed to radi
ealisam, for they seaek to artay against
as the solid negro vote, and why, in
the name of cemaion sense, shdlould
we not co'mbine to defeat them.

The Red River Valley.
Natchitoches parish, us well as the
entire Red River valley, presents to
the searcher, a home, where agri
cultural wealth can be acquired, un
surpassed by any in America, and it
strikes us as strange, that with a peo
pie owning lands and as anxious to
sell to white settlers, we have not
had ere this an influx of immigrants
to this garden spot of Louisiana.
There is not one acre of these lands,
and they are thousands in extent,
that does not, or cannot produce its
bale of cotton worth $60 or its 50
bushels of corn, worth $50, and still
men infatuated with bright stories of
the gold-teeming West, will pass by
unheeding the real Eldorado of the
South West; and more than this, some
people will leave their chances for
riches behind awl wander off, lured
by glittering stories, to find lands in
Texas cheaper and more productive,
and realize, when too late, that they
have thrown away the pearl, and all
places are better, in story bat not in
reality, than the home you live in.
We know of plantations where last
year with 165 acres in cultivation in
cotton, 202 bales averaging 4571
pounds each in weight, were prodnc
ed--this cotton sold at an average of
$62 50 net per bale, making the to
tal income from cotton alone of $12,
625, or $76,51 per acre, besides this,
the place yielded 4000 bushels corn
worth $3000, and an abundance of
peas, hay, fodder, pumpkins, &c.,
&c. Talk to us of Western farms;
of California and Texas, nothing can
equal that, and what is more, there
is not a foot of land on Red river,
that will not yield in the same pro
portion with proper attention, nor is
the above an isolated instance, for we
can name over a dozen places to our
personal knowledge that have remu
nerated their owners in the same
proportion. Why will Louisianians
break off to look for a better country ?
Are they too "cussed lazy" to work
here, and only hope to find some coun
try where a living can be obtained
without work Our labor hero,
thanks to that dreaded White League
with their "sheot-gun camapaign of
1874," as some are wont to put it, is
better than at any time since the sur
render, and the colored men are
slowly but surely finding out, that
politics with midnight clubs and
neglected fields will not feed their
families; they have learned their true
friends at last, and we now with more
hope than for years, look forward to
the permanent redemption and im
provement of our parish and State.
We have just returned from an ex
tended trip over the upper portion of
our parish, and we are more than
cheered with the appearance of the
crops. The planters are happy in
anticipation of a fine yield of both
cotten and corn, in fact, we are in
formed by those who should know,
that the prospect for a crop is as
good now, if not better, titan in any
sear for the put twenty. Rain is
neeied very much in some sections,
but tmhe condition of the fields being
clean of grass and well ecltivated,
make some amends for this want1 and
tihe erops are not yet cetually suffer
ing. Our farmers have at last yield.
ed to the stern logic of fasts, and the
consequence is, that the area In corn
planted is 10 per cent in excess of
last year, would that it were 50 per
cent, and our people would then see
that nothing would" be lost by it.
What we want in this country to
make farming pay is that we should
raise our own bread and meat, until
that is done, the years of in and out
of debt will been and off. The freed.
men having abandoned polities as a
field of support, ate working better
than ever and deserve the praise of
all.

TIHE RADICAL REFORM REPUBLICAN
RECORD.
We give below the valuation of
property with the rate of taxation
for parish purposes alone, for the past
years, since 1867, 1868, and also give
1861 as a comparison.

The rate of taxation for 1874 was

citizens in forcing the resignation of
Boullt, Myers, and their corrupt ring.
Still in the face of this damning re
cord the Republicans of this parish
have the brazen cheek to come for.
ward and ask a continuance of power,
on the plea of reform, when the only
justice our people ever got from the
miscreants, was through the threats
of a free use of hemp and buck-shot.
This is the "advancing" party, ad
vancing like one end of a see-saw
property depreciating in value over
two hundred per cent, and taxes ad
vancing at the rate of siz-thoasuanl
per cent. A pretty party, and a nice,
honest set of men to govern an in
telligent white community of tax
payers. There has been no parish in
Louisiana, as bad as all the balance
are, that has fostered and supported
as villanous a set of rascals and
thieves as Natchitoches, and the list
of radicals here from Alpha to Ome
ga, are all alike-a shake-bag set
one as good as the other, and the
other no better than the remainder.
Blunt is doing just what we said he
would do, beginning to stir up poli
ties, form clubs and make the negroes
restless and quit their crops to get
"the wordn frotp him. It will be
next year before there is a political
campaign, until that time we do not
propose to take the white men of the
parish away from their crops, nor do
we intend to allow Mr. Blunt to do
so with the negroes. If this'fellow
Blunt has not had experience enough
in this parish during last year, he will
learn some to his sad regret. We
have stood his foolishness just as
long as we are going to, and if he pro.
poses to keep on and "hare his re
venge" (as we learn he said,) then
we beg to inform him that it is a
game that two is required to play at
to make it interesting ; he will more
over find us willing and anxious to
"take a hand" whenever he feels like
"opening his play." Keep on Mr(t)
Blunt, aud the first thing you know
you'll be in search of a five story
Granite Custom-house, which you
won't find in these diggins.
Grant's letter to tihe Philadelplhia
Republicans is not exactly the dose
they expected. It possesses too much
of the vomit properties to be sooth
ing to the stomach of the anti-third
term Radicals, and we opine that his
friends in Pennsylvania regret ex
ceeding tha) they required their
great "dummy" to speak-for taking
this letter of Grant's, in which he
bunglingly attempts to decline to be
come a candidate for a third term, as
an example of talk, hle will nominate
himself for the fortieth term, with
about two more such efiuslons.
Grant may not want the third term
bad, but we will wager a small sum
that hie gets the nomination, and what
is more, he will take it. We will feel
sorry when hie does, for we differ with
the mms of our contemporaries in the
fact that we consider Grant the hard.
est man in the radical party to beat.
He has an army, besides his regular
troops, of eighty-thousand ofilen
holders, and then the Bond-holders
and shoddy speculatomrs whose name
is legion, are all' Grant men to the
last vote, and the last dollar. Put
up an honest Radical, it one can be
found, upon the Republican ticket,
and *ith a straight out man like 8.
J. Tildea, of New York, who is fear
less and honest, and the Republican
is beaten to death.
The people will out-vote Grant's
party,.but shbonuld he be on the ticket,
beaten or not, he will never leave
that White Huease anless he gives tshe
members of this Republic a taste of
his powers.
TlheiAmmigration to California is

trains are crowded with emigrants
and the rush is overwhelming. Cap

where the climate and soil isas good,
if not better than in California, and
which is in every way else more de
qirable and superior, save in gold and
the big trees. Iet the tide turn this
way, and we can assure them that
homes will net be wanting on lands

A Contrast.
The Cincinnati Gazette speal;ing
of Vice-President Wilson's tour
through some of the Southern States,
says:
"In 1875, one of the most pronoun
ced of the anti-slavery men of ?IMass
achusetts is received with honor in
Kentucky and Tennessee, is invited
to Mississippi and Texas, and none
paid him a higher reverance than ex
confederates, beth civil and military
There may be selfishness and policy
in this, but when all deductions are
made it must be admitted that the
fire in the Southern heart does not
blaze as fiercely as it once did."
In commenting upon this the St.
Louis Republican makes the follow
ing remarks :
The Gazette might have added an
other point to its moral by recalling
the fact that when Rob. E. Lee was
invited to attend the funeral of Geo.
Peabody, several prominent republi
can papers-the N. Y. Times, we
think, among the number intimated
very decidedly that the visit of such
a rebel was not only undesired by
"the loyal North," but would be re
garded as a species of insult. More
over, the Gazette might have stated
that Gen. Lee applied for the benefit
of the amnesty act, but was refused,
and went to his grave a paroled
prisoner of war. If the South is en
titled to admiration and praise for
her treatment of Wilson, what has
the North to boast of in the treatment
extended to Lee ?
All of which goes to prove that
when it comes to fawning and boot
licking some of our Southern people
cannot be surpassed. Let any one
horse statesman from the North (if
lie is radical) come South, and at once
we all stand up in row with our
thumbs in mouth like innocent school
boys to show his serene highness
what good and loyal children we are.
We think it high time this "slobber
ing" had ceased, for we gain nothing
but contempt by it. Be manly, treat
all with politeness and respect, but
none of this heroising in ours if you
please.
'The rapacity of the hungry Rad
icals of the North is hard to satisfy
indeed. They ask and receive and
the more they ask the more they re
ceive, the more they receive the more
they require. Some day a point will
be reached in this demanding and
yielding and when it does come some
thing will snap sure.
We can't attend our own centennia
without taking an oath to show that
we are not priviledged to celebrate
an event in our history we had as
much to do with as they, fought as
hard for as they; although in our
humble opinion France did all the
'independence gaining' that was done.
This only goes to show the animose
of the animal and what a great num
ber would do if they dared. And
still with all this we forgive them and
call them brothers-bah! Let's be
plain spoken. We love the con
stitution, the Union and the flag, but
we hate, with all the bitterness of our
souls, the howling demagogues of the
North who cry Saint and worship
Satan. Take that and make the most
of it ye lo!/al humbugs.
The bigot of the Catlolic T'elegraph,
encouraged by the recent aetion of
the Long Island Episcopal Conven
tion, is hammering away at the Pub
blie Schools. He is determined to
have a division of the School Fund.
I he says:
"Beligions training, according to
this eminent Protestaet stateman and
educator, must begin, pervade and
finish all other lnstruction. It is in
this point that the system of educa
tion, against which Catlhohelcs, Epiis
ceopalians and other enlightened Pro
testants protest, so sadly fails. It is
a system diametrically opposed to
the teaching of Christianity; it is an
invention of neo-Paganim, violating,
as did its prototype, the most sacred
rights of oindividual conscience and of
the family. Those who advocate re
ligious education only desire that the
present system ashould be reformed,
so that all may enjoy the advantages
of education without seacrificing con
science or religious liberty."
Agitation is doobtless very agree
able to some people, but there is no
more likelihood that realots who war
against our Pablic School system will
accomplish its overthrow than that
the grasshoppers of Kansas will turn
atd upset the Rocky Monatins. The
fanatics who talk about Godless
schools would soon talk about Godless
newspapers, and Godless Public Li
braries and Godless street cars, and
Godless pea-anut stands. Everytbing
that didn't come nader the immediate
supervisalon of the Church would be
Godless, and therefore a subject for
evagehlca-regulation. - j acisa4ti

Grant's third term letter is not so
nice as his friends lmagined it would
be; they will not want shabortly. to
"force" any more letters from Grant.
In response to the gentleman wlho
talks about a twenty-line platform
for the Ohio Democracy, Mr. W. H.
Kernan says in the Buckeye Demo
crat :
"We want a platform , a heart-of
oak platform; a platform in favor of
the reserved rights of the States ; a
platform in favor of more cuorency;
a platform in favar of wiping out the
National hanks ; a platfornm in favor
of free trade ; a platform in favor of
economy, retrenchment and reform;
a platform in favor of the one-term
prlnciple. We want the masses of
our party to have a hand in the mak
iing of that platform, and we trust
that no Western tool of Wall street
will be permitted to put a plank or
splinter in it. Nobody is 'howling a
whoop' against a platform except a
few pulling, long-eared, cowardly,
doubled-destilled quintessence of hog
wash idiots."
This is rather earnest, but is migh
ty sound doctrine.
Our Northern Democratic friends
seem not at a loss for a platform both
short and to the point. Here, the
Republican constituancy is so rery
intelligent that they can't tell a plat
form from a step-ladder, and Kel
logg and his friends run generally on
United State bayonets, which, up to
this time has been a success, but we
are of the opinion that hereafter that
thing won't work."

their views and opinions upon the
great questions with which the future
is pregnant. We wish the Delta a

The Memphis Avalanche, in read
ing a little lecture to the Cineinnati
Commercial, remarks:
Slavery, we beg leave to suggest to
the Commercial, is a dead issue in
the Soath. It has not beel inflated
to the dimensions of a fourth class
ghost for ten years. It is only when
Columbian orators in the Nokth, who,
soaring in the boundless realmns of
poppycock, declare that somebody or
something) wants to revive slavery,
that attention is recalled to the half
forgotten fact that Sambo and Phillis
where once "chattels."
Let the independest "bulger" lHals
tead have his swing; his gas can
harm no one, for that slavery dodge
is about as dead as the "bloody shirt"
farce-that is, dead until 1876, by
which time the howlers and shakers
will have taken breath and will at us
again with tIle '"crimson rag" and the
forth class ghost of slavery. But we
can stand it. Bloody 'shlirt is glory
to Sheridan the "bandit."

We had the extreme pleasure of
serving our four years in thie Confed
crate army, but we can't swallow thlat
story of J. D. in relation to the
killing of Gen. Polk, published in
the N. Y. HeraldM. If it is intended
as an article for dramstice efect, well
and good, but as a matter of history
it is all bosh. Will some of oua r Co
federate ofiaers who were members
of tie signal corps, tell as how and
in what manner thie following, taken
from thie letter alluded to could be
made to tally.with the truth:
While Simonason was upon his knees
sighting his gnu foranothpr disebahrge,
Captain Leonard, chief of Howard's
signal corps, stitng on his horse be
side me, read the Confederato signal
code that our adlleern had Interpre
ted at Lookout Mountain and eaght
the words:
"General Polk is killed!F With a
look of amasement, Leonard turned
to Howard and Stanley and exclaim.
ed:
"Bishop Polk is killed!"
"What?" exclaimed Howard; '"have
you interpreted the signal correty f"
"Yes, General; Simoson'sa last
shot killed him. They Jare signaling
it along the line."
How maiold such a thing, as "Gen.
Polk is killed," be sigaled f aless
they had arrmaged it qimedilly for
sueh a contingeney; seah a thiang we
condsider as utterly Imposdble, and in
the whole thing is a very neast story,
but it wona't held water.

The platform of the Ohio republi
cans rings out tile true issue, and the
first plank brings us face to face with
the facts we brve in fauture to deal
with. The question of this government
being a Nation of lindividaals or a
community of States, will be decided
at the ballot-box at once and for all
time, in the fall eleetions of 1876
