The future tone of this paper can be
judged from its past. We will coutinue
to advocate to success, the rights of the
TAXED, that holnesty and capability,

never ceasing war upon Kellogg and his
corrupt officials-knowing then, to be in

We can assure the pnblic!thatjwe will
not hesitate to attack the acts of any po

them to be antagonistic to public good.
We are the servant of no clique or party,
and intend solely to protect and defend
