WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1873.
Champion rAmerican Comic Paper !
Ilalstrated by a corps of the best Ameri
ean artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the establishld humorous and
satirical paper of the conntr'. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisty the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnighlt
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shlants by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editoripls,
it aehievtd even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
have yielded still further to the pnulic
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic writs, be
inmg the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustraftions for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellow, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fmne.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this acconut may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offbud the most fas
tidious.
