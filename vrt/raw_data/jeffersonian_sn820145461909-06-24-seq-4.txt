Summary of Events
Mr. Taft has at last broken his si
lence with a message to Congress
recommend.ing an
Income Tax. amendment to the Con
stitution granting to
the Federal Government the right to
levy an income tax and an excise tax
upon corporations of 2 per cent, of
their net income, these measures to
be substituted for, or supplemental,
to an inheritance tax.
Thus far, opponents of the meas
ure have succeeded in postponing de
bate on the subject, though why Con
gress might not take it up immedi
ately none but the adroit enemies of
these taxes could fathom. With the
Senate doing everybody and Congress
doing nothing, we have a glorious
bunch of representatives.
The following formal statement
was issued from the office of Attor
ney General Wicker-
The Sugar sham on June 14:
Steals. “It was learned at
the Department of Jus
tice that the records of the recent
trial in New York and a variety of
other documents pertaining to the
transactions between Adolph Segal,
the Real Estate Trust Company and
the American Sugar Refining Com
pany, had been obtained by the de
partment and were being carefully
examined. No statement could be
obtained as to intended action by the
department, but it was ascertained
that the Attorney General was giv
ing personal attention to the case,
and that the matter is receiving the
most careful and thorough investi
gation.”
This means that the administra
tion can no longer ignore the de
mand that the wrong-doing of the
Sugar Trust be officially recognized
and prosecuted.
This case grows out of the loan
made by the American Sugar Refin
ing Co. (the Sugar Trust) to the
Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Co., an
independent concern. With gross
double-dealing and bad faith, the
trust foreclosed the loan and put its
competitor out of business. The
trickery practiced in this transaction
came within the knowledge of Re
ceiver Earle of the Real Estate Trust
Company of Philadelphia. Possibly
Mr. Earle was somewhat an amateur
in the methods of high finance and
instead of admiring the tactics of the
trust, he was indignant. He laid the
case before then President Roosevelt
and Attorney General Bonaparte,
who winked the other eye and de
clined to have the Havemeyer gang
disturbed.
The other day the suit for dam
ages instituted by the Pennsylvania
Company was settled out of court for
$10,250,000. In the course of this
settlement the Sugar Trust itself ad
mitted that it was guilty of flagrant
violations of the Sherman anti-trust
law.
Coming as this does on the heels
of the revelations of fraud in the
New York custom-house, and while
the Sugar Trust is even now in
Washington lobbying for tariff ad
vantages which rob the consumers of
millions annually, Mr. Wickersham is
up against a situation in which the
public will not tolerate trifling.
The Sugar Trust paid back to the
Government $2,000,000 as a part of
what it admittedly stole through
short weights and fraudulent meth
ods. A few minor employees were
arrested and the Trust at once, with
dastardly cowardice, “discharged”
these men whom it had used as cat’s
paws for years, and in reference to
“the man higher up” actually tried
to fix the responsibility on the late
Havemeyer. Doubtless Havemeyer
was guilty, but for his equally guilty
confederates to shield themselves be
hind his tombstone was about as low
as ghoulishness could get. What will
the present administration do with
the Sugar Trust? Upon its action in
this matter hinges the entire govern
ment policy. The trust has been
caught with the goods, and blind as
Mr. Wickersham would like to be, he
cannot avoid seeing what is pointed
out. Roosevelt very successfully
played the hypocrite with a great ma
jority of people by making the big
noise, but the fat Taft is in a very
close corner.
The Legislature of Florida has
just refused a $25,000 appropriation
for the Negro Agricul-
Florida’s tural and Mechanical
Good Move. College of the State, a
courageous policy that
cannot be too highly commended. As
graphically described by Senator
Cone, these negro students in brass
buttons and gaudy uniforms lolled
around the city and even invaded the
Legislative halls in pompous idle
ness. The absurdity of these so
called industrial colleges, which teach
anything but industry, flourishing at
the expense of people who cannot get
any dependable labor! The tax upon
the South in feeding and clothing
an enduring slaternly, dishonest, ut
terly unreliable negroes is sufficient,
without being taxed to bedeck a fa
vored number of bucks and wenches,
who forthwith become too good for
their own race. The Southern plant
er and the Southern house-wife have
patiently, for generations, taught
these Africans all the valuable things
the blacks can assimilate and use.
Are the “educated” negroes patiently
training and teaching the semi-sav
ages of their own race? Not on your
tintype. These “culled ladies and
geniemen” are hunting Government
berths, or “cussing out” Taft for
desiring to rid the services of an oc
casional coon incumbent.
Cardinal Andrieu, of France, has
refused to appear in answer to a
court summons on the
Will the following ground:
Church “That the law became
Deny This? non-existent for Cath
olics the minute their
supreme chief, the incorruptible
guardian of the morals of individ
uals and nations, condemned it as
inimical to the property, authority
and liberty of the Church.” With
commendable absence of both mod
esty and verbiage M. Andrieu has
stated the historical position of the
Roman Catholic Church in its su
blime contempt for the laws of any
country in which the church influ-
©b* '3aff«rsoniart
as They HQppeHi> Doian
ence is strong. The average Roman
Catholic in America waxes terribly
indignant if the patriotism of his
church is impugned, realizing not at
all" that the free institutions under
which he thjives exist not because of,
but in spite of papal authority.
When the 14,000,000 of Roman Cath
olics in the United States shall have
multiplied to 40,000,000, even 20,-
000,000, the same conditions will pre
vail here that we see in church-rid
den France, Italy, Mexico, etc. The
pope will dictate the laws, control
the institutions, constitute himself
sole tribunal of justice. Why should
this be denied? The church never
changes its policy, and the honestly
misguided adherents thereof, who fat
uously believe that “Catholic Amer
ica” would remain democratic Amer
ica, may take it ex Cathedra that
they deceive themselves. History
would not deceive them, and the
avowed purpose of the church has
never been officially modified.
Will the pope rebuke the insolent
Cardinal for his insult to the laws
of France? No. And fanatic adher
ents there are idolizing Andrieu for
his attitude.
A strong ally has been added to the
ranks of those fighting for pure food
in the American Medical
For Pure Association. At its re-
Food. cent convention the As-
sociation upheld the
ruling of Secretary Wilson against
benzoate of soda in can goods. Strong
forces are needed to combat the clear
purpose of the present administra
tion to pauper the manufacturers as
against the consumer. The recent
victory scored by the blended liquor
men shows clearly that adulterations
are to be connived at. The decision
of Solicitor General Bowers is about
as clear as mud. Sagely Mr. Bowers
observes that:
“There is no more reason for say
ing that alcohol becomes whisky be
cause colored and flavored like some
true whisky than for saying that al
cohol becomes brandy because col
ored or flavored like some brandy,”
he says. “On the other hand, the
mere addition of harmless coloring
or flavoring matter to whisky is not
the introduction of a foreign sub
stance, but is merely an enlargement
of the proportion of one proper con
stituent. It is merely a form of di
lution just as the addition of water
is. So long as the mixed article va
ries only in respect of being stronger
or weaker, without losing distinctive
flavors and properties in substantial
degree and consequently the article
has not been altered in its essential
nature, it cannot be said that the
public has given the name whisky to
the article in ignorance of its charac
ter or under a delusion concerning
the things to which the name whisky
has been applied.”
Mr. Bowers’ opinion does not make
clear that either he understands that
pure whisky is only 50 per cent, al
cohol, water being a constituent that
is driven out in course of distillation
till the proper strength of alcohol is
obtained. The addition of water to
pure whisky would not, therefore, be
in the nature of a dilution, but of an
adulteration, harmless but fraudu
lent on the part of the manufacturer.
Mr. Bowers’ decision gives abundant
scope for the mixers of wood alco
hol, burnt sugar water and flavoring
to get in their deadly work.
Perennially there crops up the
charge that Mrs. Mary Baker G. Ed
dy, “Mother” of the
Is Mrs. Eddy Christian Science
Alive? Church, is either dead,
or virtually a helpless
puppet in the hands of leaders of the
Church, who exploit her. It is even
said that a dummy is made up to rep
resent Mrs. Eddy. Refutation of
these charges has not been as com
plete as the situation would apparent
ly warrant. Mrs. Eddy is an aged
lady, and her death, or “passing on,”
as her people prefer to term the fact
of dissolution, should not prove a
calamity to the faith she founded.
Very recently all the talk on this
score has been revived. It should be
ended. Mrs. Eddy’s demise, or in
capacity, would prove nothing except
the credulity of those who believe
she should be able to “heal herself.”
As a religion, Christian Science has
made remarkable progress. Many of
its teachings are commendable. It
has made quiet, persistent war upon
intemperance of all sorts, upon an
ger, hatred, and all things impure.
From a moral standpoint it has as
much right to respect as any other
cult, and it is unfortunate that the
question of “healing” physical ills has
been made paramount. The power
of mind over matter has been recog
nized since man has been able to
evolve any system of philosophy at
all; but the recognition of the lim
itation of this power is of. the highest
importance. Never more so than to
day, when we have every variation of
Platonism and Neo-Platonism possi
ble to imagine, some of them sincere
efforts to teach humanity to “look
up, and not down,” and others cloaks
under which pure charlatanism hides:
and when fanaticism has gone so far
as to object to teaching prevention of
disaese, in the public schools (a
striking exemplification of which oc
curred recently) on the ridiculous
ground that children must not be
taught that sickness is real. In the
instance mentioned the protest was
actually effective.
Dispatches from Paris indicate that
