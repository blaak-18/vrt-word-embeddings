PAPER TALKS TO

“Twilight” Om Addresses
Albert Lea Audience on
Current Problems

Urges Listeners to Let Senators
Know That American Sola*

(By EYETHEBE)
ALBERT LEA, MINN., April 7.
“Twilight” Orn, editor of The Minne
sota Fiery Cross, was greeted by an
overflow crowd when he appeared for
his lecture here tonight. For nearly
two hours the editor held his audi
ence as he presented a number of
pressing problems now confronting
the people of this country were given
frequent rounds of applause attest
ing that he touched points which ran
in line with thoughts of the majority
of his audience. The Americans in
this community are very much in
sympathy with the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan and growing more so
with each passing day.
There are 14,000,000 foreign-born
people in the United States today,
only one-half of whom have become
naturalized,” said Mr Orn. “Previous
to the opening of the twentieth cen
tury. America melted down the fore
ign elements that came to our shores,
but in late years the type of aliens
coming to this country is obviously
such as to threaten the welfare of
the nation.”
“Even those foreigners that go to
the trouble of getting an American
citizenship today are inferiors to an
astoundinig degree. Seventy-five per
cent of the aliens naturalized be
tween January 1, 1907 and June 30,
1921, nearly 2,000,000 peaple of un
known origin and alien outlook, pos
sessed the mental development of
children in the fourth grade or
worse. With cold figures laying
clearly before us the menace of mod
ern immigration, the demagogues
shout for wide open doors in order,
go it seems, to get votes from the
alien-minded peoples within our bor
ders. You have seen the sinister ac
tivities of the Un-American organi
zations in this country as they seek
to stampede the politicians in Wash
ington so as to bring about the de
feat of the Johnson immigration bill.
Nordic Immigration Assets
“We are not getting the kind of
people today that came to our shores
with the oil immigration tide. Our
Nordic forebears who came to Ameri
ca as immigrants turned their backs
to the past and quickly grasped the
spirit of America making shortly,
citizens of the finest type. God-fear
ing men and women they were with
strong minds and ready hands. They
get their plows in the virgin prairies
and drove their axes deep in the
primeval forests. Lo, and behold, in
a short period of time they took a
mighty ‘part in the building of the
world's greatest nation. The new
immigration is Latin and Alpine
largely, therefore detrimental to the
best interests of the United States.
Let our senators and congressmen
know at once that we will tolerate no
half-way measures in solving the
problem of immigration.
Especially 1 urge that you let the
senators know that you want an
American solution rather than one
of political expediency. The United
states senate has always been a
stumbling block in the way of com-
Erehensive action, whenever the pro
lem of foreign immigration was de
manding attention. There are at the
present time 6,000,000 inferior and
very inferior aliens in this country.
A short-sighted immigration policy
will increase this terrible horde of
human riff raff that we have to con
tend with at the present time:
After a three-day conference at
Ginling college, Nanking, China, a
China Association for Christian High
er Education has been formed for the
purpose of uniting all those who
are engaged in higher education in
China under Christian auspices.
Membership is open, also, to Christian
teachers in non-Christian schools. It
is the aim of this new organization
to promote the activities and raise
the standards of the work now car
ried on in China’s Christian colleges.

Congressmen from
Alien Districts
Ninety per cent of the congress
men who have introduced bills to nul
lify the constitution of the United
States by permitting the sale of wine
and beer, represent congressional
districts which have been submerged
under the alien tide. Many of them
are themselves in close association
with alien or unassimilated groups.
We are importing constituents by tne
hundred thousand annually for con
gressmen of this type. If we keep it
up, in a certain number of years the
men in congress who represent Amer
ican sentiment will find themselves
in the minority. At present, America
may well rejoice that the congress
men loyal to the spirit of the consti
tution outnumber those who have in
troduced beer bills by approximately
9 to 1. We call the attention of the
dry congressmen to the fact that by
passing a proper immigration bill
they can restrict the growth of the
anti-constitutional groups.
Klansmen Grow Tall
in lowa
At a Klan ceremonial held in an
lowa county recently a man from
among a crowd of ruffians tried to
break through the line of guards, but
was stopped.
In a few minutes he returned with
a gang to force his way through, and
the officer in charge massed guards
and forced the intruders back, driv
ing the gang leader under the fence.
In doing so ,the guard officer led the
charge.
Several days afterward a group of
men were discussing the affair and
one of the men said, “Say. Frank,
did you see that Klan show?”
“Yes, I was there,” was the reply.
“Where were you?”
“I was on the fence line where that
fellow tried to break through the
lines,” Frank answered.
“Oh, you were, eh? Then you saw
that big fellow who seemed to be in
charge of those guards? Wasn’t he
tall?
“Tall! Why he was so tall he
reached the first woodpecker hole in
a telegraph pole. Who was he. any
how? There’s no such tall fellow
around here.”
“I dunno.” Frank answered, as he
passed a knowing glance to certain of
the crowd standing around. They
grinned to themselves.
Frank was the tall guard, himself,
but his friend evidently didn’t recog
nize him under his regalia.
ILLINOIS KLANS TO
MEET AT ROCKFORD
Celebration Will Be Largest Ever
Held in Middle We.st, Says
Announcement
CHICAGO. ILL., April 7.—llli
nois Klandom will concentrate its
efforts in making the three-day cele
bration at Rockford, July 3, 4 and 5,
the biggest demonstration of Ameri
canism ever staged in the middle
west, according to an announcement
from the headquarters of the Grand
Dragon of the Realm.
Early announcement of the affair is
made so that no other Illinois city
will make plans for a Ku Klux de
monstration on the nation’s birth
day.
Klansmen, through the Realm, are
invited to participate in making the
Rockford affair a success. That city’s
wonderful demonstration last year
proves the ability of its Klansmen to
plan and carry out stupendous af
fairs.
While the details of the three-day
program are not to be given out this
far in advance, it is known that a
great merchants’ apd manufacturers’
exposition will be a feature that will
bring extensive exhibits to Rockford
and give firms and individuals an op
portunity to display their products
to the scores of thousands of visitors
who will be in attendance.
Pageants, novel entertainment
features, initiation ceremonies, fire
works display, patriotic addresses and
parades will be on the program.
Preacher Talks on “The
Hope of Protestantism”
COLUMBUS, KAN., April 7.—Point
ing out the work that is before the
Protestant churches, the Rev. C. D.
Walker, Wichita, in a sermon here re
cently, declared that they must be
united and stand as one body and not
be divided as they are at present by
creeds and doctrines. His subject
was, “The Hope of Protestantism.’’
The minister told of the high type
of Christianity, which lasted several
hundred years after Christ’s ascen
sion, and then of the gradual falling
away. He described the establish
ment of the church of Rome.
Reading in brief from the latest
text books of the Catholic press, date
January, 1924, and containing ques
tions and answers, he showed some
of the teachings of the church in the
United States, including the placing
of church above everything, even in
cluding the duties of the heads of
states.

SENATE LAND FRAUDS
PROSE PROGRESSES
Telegrams Between Creager and
Company May Be Inspect
ed by Committee
(Rnrrau of Publication and (education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 7.
The senate committee investigating
the Texas cases of alleged land
frauds in the Rio Grande valley in
the Lone Star state is getting its
breath for a few days, having ad
journed until next week And
there is a lull in the storm in which
Senator Heflin, of Alabama and oth
ers are trying to convict R. B. Crea
ger and the Almo Land and Sugar
company.
In the meantime the committee is
making an effort to subpoena all tele
grams from Washington by Mr. Crea
ger, or by his attorney, (Jeorge Hill,
to any land companies or others in
Texas since December 1.
Chairman Moses directed that a
report submitted by Postal Inspector
O. B. Williamson, who looked into
the fraud charges, be printed as a
confidential document.
Senator Heflin is going to take an
other try at it next week before
pressing in the senate to ask for a
new committee to hold these hear
ings. He claims that the chairman,
Senator Moses, of New Hampshire, is
unfair and is charging that Moses is
assisting his friend Creager in every
way he possibly can.
Public Opinion
Public opinion is a powerful force.
It makes presidents and unmakes
them, drives cabinet members fuming
into retirement, makes policies stick,
or wrecks them, makes laws enforce
able or reverse. Then it is, no wonder
that there is such a vast amount of
propaganda in the world —everybody
is trying to make the public believe
something or other—and the only safe
safe thing is for the public to be
thoroughly informed; for usually
when the public knows all about both
sides of a question it will decide right
ly. The only method of constant ap
proach to the public is through the
daily newspaper. The magazine that
tries to teach, to advise, reaches him
every day. It speaks to more people
than all the other professions com
bined, and it speaks much oftener.
There is hardly a person who is as
much as ten years old in Savannah
who does not read part, at least, of a
newspaper every day—and that is al
most true of the whole of Georgia,
and the whole of the country.
Newspapers therefore have to be
careful to avoid being “sed.’’ Propa
ganda approaches them from many
directions, in many disguises.; they
endeavor to give both sides of all
questions to their readers —and some
times they are criticised for that; and
at the same time they endeavor to
avoid having propaganda appear as
news. A newspaper that leans to one
political party should not on that ac
count treat the opposite party as if it
did not exist. The public has a right
to make up its mind on public ques
tions, and it therefore has the right
to be properly informed so that it
can properly make up its mind; it
must be so informed by its newspa
pers. The newspaper on that account
has a public duty to perform that
probably has no equal in importance
-the duty of informing the public
so that public opinion may be formed
knowing all the time that it is pub
lic opinion that makes for retrogres
sion or for progress. The better the
public opinion, the saner and the wis
er, then the greater will be the prog
ress; and the converse is true. —Sa-

THE FIERY CROSS
FEDERAL GRAND IURY
OPPOSES IMMIGRATION
Toledo Body Askn Congress to
P*BH Bill—Many Aliens
Before Court
(Bureau of Publication and Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON, D. C„ March 28.
Only the other day the federal grand
jury at Toledo, Ohio., sitting for the
northern division of Ohio, western
part, urged congress to further re
strict immigration, appalled by tbe
large number of alien foreign born
offenders haled before it. Among
other things the twenty members of
the jury from twenty different cities
and towns iu Ohio declared in a
memorial to congress complained as
follows:
“We members of the federal grand
jury are required by law to hear and
investigate alleged crimes in the
northern district of Ohio; and in so
doing are compelled to leave peace
ful pursuits snd our homes, only to
find that a large majority of such
charges are brought against the
foreign element; we are shocked by
the number, quality and character
of foreign defendants, charged with
disobedience to our laws and our in
stitutions; we urge congress to act
properly and promptly in bringing
relief. The conditions compel us to
urge congress, the guardians of our
portals, to protect our country and
our flag.”
The memorial was signed by J. W.
Bauting, of Toledo; Henry A. Mack
of Lima; F. E. Dustman of Van Wert;
and the other 17 members of the
grand jury.
And yet Congressman Mooney, of
Cleveland, says it is unfair to re
strict immigration. Even so big a
statesman as Congressman Theodore
Burton declares he won’t do it be
cause it might offend the Japanese.
This surely is a time for all 100
per cent Americans to act. If men
like Mooney and Burton won’t vote
for America and for American wages
and standards, for bread and meat
for red-blooded Americans and their
families, for perpetuating this rich
heritage of ours, it is high time that
all the American voters in Cleveland
were getting together and voting for
men who will.
Look at the Figures
Our existing immigration laws do
not keep the riff raff out. They do
not keep out the epileptics, alien in
sane and crimminal classes. Take a
look. During the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1923, 673.406 aliens entered
this country; during the last six
months of 1923, 585,199 aliens got in.
It is impossible for our inspectors
and examiners to weed out these
dangerous aliens with such a large
number to handle. They can’t do it
because it is physically impossible to
do so.
The Rising Tide of Aliens
(The Chicago Herald-Examiner)
The Brooklyn Eagle, published in
a city with the largest alien popula
tion in the United States, prints an
editorial announcing that the John
son immigration bill is dead, and re
joicing therefor. In support of its
contention that bitterness aroused by
the discriminatory feature of the
Johnson bill is slowly gaining ground,
it cites a recent indignation meeting
called against the bill, and asserts
that Catholics, Protestants, and Jews
joined in assailing it. The paper also
cites the fact that Secretary Hughes
is against the measure, “because it
will irritate Japan.”
It would be difficult to find better
arguments in favor of the Johnson
bill than those offered by the Eagle
against it. It bases opposition to
the measure on religious grounds
when it asserts that Catholics, Pro
testants and Jews join in protest
against it. That is an attempt to
arouse religious prejudice against a
measure which has properly nothing
of religious or anti-religious charac
ter about it.
The Johnson bill is designed to keep
America American; not to keep it
Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish, or a
combination of the three. It is not
designed to keep out Catholics, Pro
testants or Jews because they are
such, but to keep out alien minded
peoples, of whatever religion, who
seek to colonize in American cities
in greater numers than w r e can as
similate. The opposition cited is
wrong and proves the wisdom of the
restrictive Dill because it reveals
that the interest of the opponents is
in the foreign peoples who would be
barred by the measure, rather than
in the American people who would be
protected by it.
Thd same is true of the fact that
Secretary Hughes opposes it because
it would irritate the Japanese. The
interest of the American people
ought to be in America, not in Ja
pan.
It is true that opposition to the
bill is gaining ground. It is doing
so because the foreign element in
this country is organized and fight
ing with all manner of propaganda
to defeat the restriction and let in
hordes of aliens. The fact that this
foreign minded propaganda within
America can threaten the bill ought
to convince patriotic Americans that
such a defense measure must be
passed.

PITTSBURG, KAN.. April 7.
Bitter denunciation of the Crawford
county newspapers to mention a re
cent contribution of the local Klan
to the Girard A. M. E. church is con
tained in a statement issued by a
member of the congregation. The
statement contains praise for the
work of the Ku Klux Klan in aid
ing law enforcement and assisting in
making better citizens.
The statement, in part: “Some of
us think that it is because these pa
pers are opposed to the great Ameri
can organization, which is composed
of native born, 100 per cent Ameri
cans. But allow me to add that here
is one colored person who, were he
white, would be knocking at the door
of the Klan. for the Klan is the sav
iour of America and American prin
ciples. But what I want you to tell
the world is that these Klansmen
gave our church SIOO, which we were
in need of and which we very much
appreciate. So allow me to add that
any organization that is for the Prot
estant church, whether its members
be white or black, is the organization
I am for.”

by including, with Buddhist and Shin

Jeople. Missionaries now at work in
apan can recall conspicuous wooden
signs posted throughout the country
which contained edicts outlawing
Christianity and promising dire pun
ishment to any who professed it. To
day representatives of this “outlaw”
faith, given recognition by the gov
ernment, dare to stand before the
premier and declare that Japan has
made a serious mistake in refusing
to include religious instruction in the
school system, and demand that mis
sionary schools be placed on an equal
footing with government schools.

ATMOSPHERE CLEARING
IN NATIONAL CAPITAL
TABLE RESOLUTION
TO REMOVE MELLON
Undivided Attention of Congress
Needed on Many Import
ant Measures
(Bureau of PuMlenlluu anil Murall**)
WASHINGTON, D. C„ April 2.
—At the present writing the Po
tomac river is in flood stage,
Washington is mantled in snow,
the big Capitol up on the hill is
sprinkled in virtuous white, and
Uncle Sam has a headache after
a bad night out. However, there
is less scandal right now, and the
atmosphere is assuming a more
normal condition. Investigation
is about to give way to legisla
tion, and it looks as if politics is
going to take a back seat for a
while.
Hearsay evidence never goes in a
well regulated court, and it is about
to be thrown out in the national cap
ital. Senators are coming around to
where they have a decent resnect for
honest evidence and we are about to
get down to business. However, what
has happened is like pointing the fin
ger of warning at rottenness and
crookedness and is bound to bring
about better conditions in govern
ment circles. The escapades of Fall,
Doheny and Sinclair will tend to
make the world better. The rotten
ness in Denmark has been exposed,
and now all the people want to see
is the guilty properly punished. The
public will be satisfied with nothing
less. The law is no respecter of per
sons. Let the indictments, trials and
punishments of the guilty proceed.
Daugherty a Marked Man
Harry M. Daugherty is no longer
attorney general. For a long time
everyone hut himself knew he was a
marked man. Mr. Daughertv was lit
erally dropped overboard by Presi
dent Coolidge. and some of Daugh
erty’s friends are disposed to cfiti
cize the president for firing Daugh
erty before he had a chance to de
fend himself. The other folks think
the president ought to have acted
sooner than he did and that he might
have used harsher terms.
Be that as it may, the Daugherty
dismissal will not interfere with the
Coolidge nomination at Cleveland in
June. Everything seems to be so set
up for that event that Washington
and New York newspaper men are
now predicting the nay and almost
the hour the nomination will be
made. It is scheduled for June 12.
Mr. Daugherty’s close friends say
he is not whipped by any means, but
that he is also a 100 per cent Repub
lican organization man and that he
will be found fighting in the Repub
lican ranks this year just as he has
in the past.
Nipped 111 the Bud
After disposing of Mr. Daugherty,
a rush was started on Secretary of
the Treasury Mellon. The McKellar
move to dismiss Mellon was quickly
tabled, end the resolution went to
the calendar, where it is more than
likely to remain, and sleep perma
nently. Senator Robinson, Demo
cratic leader, disclaimed all respon
sibility for the move on the part of
Senator McKellar, of Tennessee. The
Republicans were unitedly for Mel
lon, and the Democrats were divided
in opposition, so under those circum
stances it was thought best to pig
eon-hole the matter.
A statement of the circumstances
under which Mr. Mellon had accept
ed appointment to the cabinet showed
that he had been scrupulous in en
deavor that there should be no seem
ing invasion of the law. He was the
first to question his own eligibility
and it was only after seeking legal
advice and divesting himself of all
stock ownership in a large number
of corporations that he felt he could
qualify for the treasury post.
The Democrats themselves seem to
have put a quietus on the reported
intention of “going down the line”
and picking off cabinet members, one
by one. The country is to be con
gratulated that the senate seems to
have found itself again and that it
will now get down to business. Con
gress will now likely pull itself to
gether and begin legislation in earn
est. Speed up the program is now
the slogan on noth sides of the cham
ber.

It is going to take 735 votes in lb*

ways in force in Democratic conven
tions. Mr. McAdoo is undoubtedly
still in the lead, but it is a question
whether he can ever hope to be able
to command enough support to get
by on the two-thirds rule. It is
thought now that he can probably
run up to 500 or 600 votes, but ta
reach the necessary 735 is a horse of
another color. It is believed is
Washington that if he is not nomin
ated that he will be in position ta
dictate the nominee of that conven
tion on account of his great strength.
Robinson's Plea
A call to the senate to take up and
put through as quickly as possible
important legislation waiting atten
tion is contained in a statement is
sued by Senator Robinson, Democrats
ic leader in the senate. The Arkan
sas senator has had his ear to the
ground, and he begins to hear the
murmurs of discontent all over the
country.
Senator Robinson declared that )L
was not the disposition of the Demo
cratic party to prolong unduly the
investigations of various government
departments, although he insisted
that it was necessary to reveal all im
portant matters and to bring about
a thoroughly honest administration
of public affairs.
The things needing attention by
congress include tax reductitgi, ad
justed compensation, immigration,
expression of legislative will that
freight rate structure be reorganized
with a view to reductions on farm
products and commodities essential
to farming and the elimination of
the Pullman surcharge. In addition
to all this, congress is just beginning
to wake up to a realization that four
months have slipped by and nothing
much done, except making all the in
vestigations that ha v « been made.
It’s time now to begin legislation
and get off the investigating end of
the work, if this session of congrean
is to hope to accomplish very muck.
