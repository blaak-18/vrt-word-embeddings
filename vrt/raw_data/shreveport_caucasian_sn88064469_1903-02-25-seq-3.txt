TILLMAN SPOKE.
He Discoursed on the Indianola PostoMEe
and Booker T. Washington.
Washington, Feb. 25.-A large
crowd was attracted to the senate
]Monday, most of them visiting Daugh
ters of the American Revolution.
Washington's farewell address was
read by Mr. Dubois of Idaho. The om
nibus public building bill was passed
and the postoffice appropriation bill
was considered without final action.
Mr. Tillman spoke for nearly two
hours, principally in reply to Mr.
Spooner on the Indianola postoffice
case. He said that if the policy of
the administration in regard to the
equality of the negro was carried on
and Booker Washington should be ap
pointed to the cabinet he would vote
for his confirmation.
Mr. Tillman, while stand1ng in the
aisle and endeavoring to get recogni.
tion to speak regarding the Indianola,
Miss., postoffice inquired what was up
if the postoffice appropriation bill
went over. Injecting some humor in
to the proceedings the president pro
tem replied that he "understood the
senator from South Carolina was com
ing up on his feet," at which the sen
ate was convulsed.
Mr. Tillman then said he propos
ed to surprise his friends and astonish
his enemies if he has any by being
mild and temperate in what he would
say.
"If we had known at the beginning
of the civil war," said he, "what we
Nm uaum m.eam
khow aew, there wold have been as
war." /
Heo nquired why the large ae.t.
of law-abfriag people of ladie
should be punished because tiere was
a small lawless and brutal elieant.'
It was contrary, he said, "to the fuN
damental principles of the Aaglo
Saxon jluiprudence."
Replylag to some remarks made by
Mr. Spoemer in his speech, Mr. Till
man said:
"T& (h snt In the dranm of the wild.
it mis na; n the aream or use wuu*
est sethat roams over the southern
states wfth kh 4i an hintthat the fed.'
eral gobverment to not supreme," but
he sald tberts **e some cognate prop
ositions which t 'ave been ignored."
The galleries were crowded, many
of the bccupants being visit!ng Daugh
tetriof the Amirican ReVolution, who.
listened attentively to the reading by
Mr. Dubois of Idaho of Washing
ton's farewell address. `
During the reading of the address.
Reed Smoot. senator-elect from Utah
entered the chamber and took a seat
beside Mr. Kerens.

of Great Brilliancy.
New Orleans, Feb. 25.-Rex appear
ed riding in a superb chariot at the
head of a fine pageant. The subject
presented was "Fetes and Feasts" on

floats. Mythology, Biblical lore and

for designs. The costumes were rich
and artistic and a quarter of a million
people paid homage to the merry mon
arch.

[XCITING SCENE.
Woman Identifies a Man as the Mardeeps
of Her Sister.
Toledo, O., Feb. 25.-"That's the
man who split my sister's head open.
That's the man who killed my sister!
That man there-there!" cried aged
Johanna Sullivan in court, when Al
Wade was brought into the court
room to be tried on the charge of
murdering Kate Sullivan. The Sulll
van murder has been the most pro
found mystery the Toledo police have
had to deal with in years. The crime
was committed two years ago. The
victims were spinster sisters. They
were attacked in their home just out
side the city limits and robbed after
Kate Sullivan had been brutally mur
dered. Johanna Sullivan escaped and
crawled a mile for assistance, bleeding
profusely. The arrest of Wade created
a genuine sensation here, and the
courtroom is too small by far to ao
commodate the crowds which have
socked here at the opening trial. The
alleged identification created no little
exeltement in the court.
