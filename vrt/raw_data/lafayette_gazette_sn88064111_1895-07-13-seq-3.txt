AN ITA.
She's a pretty pass in boots.
With a saucy name that suits
Every glamne.
Is it whispered. is it suag.
Still it ripples on the tongue
In a dance.
Oh. she walks so pt-a-pat.
And she talks of this and that
Such a way.
Just to watch her witching blush
Even Socrates would hush
Half a day.
She is not sa angel; aot
They are out e' place below.
Let us grieve.
Yes perchance there is a wing
Hid beneath that puffy thing
Styled a sleeve.
Her singing makes me think
Of a trtekey bobolink
All delight.
With his silver strain allow
Where the apple blossoms blow
Pink and white.
Like a wild rose, newly born,
Bursting into bloom at morn.
Dew agleam.
So entrancing is her smile.
Lo. it haunts me all the while
In a dream.

RACE FOR A BRIDE.
T was in those days
when Sharp's island,
which divides the mouth
of the Choptank and the
Chesapeake bay, was
the site of three large
farms of more than four
hundred acres. But the
ceaseless roll of the
tides of the bay and river on the two
sides and the numerous ice gorges of
the northern rivers of the bay have
caused the island to be worn away to
a mere shadow of its former self.
The lighthouse, which is now more
than a half-mile away from the north
ern end of the island, was then on
solid ground, one hundred or two hun
dred yards from the water. But the
Choptank has not been changed.
It is still one of the most picturesque
rivers in the state. In fact, it puts
one more in mind of the interior of a
West Indian island than that of a
middle Atlantic state. The growth of
vegetation is so luxuriant and dense
that in some cases it is with great difti
culty that passage is made in going
through the woods which line its bank.
The water is of a beautiful dark blue
and has that freshness and saltness of
air about it which is only possessed by
the ocean itself.
On this particular day the sky was
radiant with flooded sunshine, and a
gentle breeze was blowing redolent
with summer's fragrances. There was
a delightful calmness on the river and
bay, which persuaded one to spend his
time in idly dreaming. A number of fish
ermen were indulging in this occupa
tion under the shady trees after several
hours of sport. Suddenly from one
end of the island came a swiftly-rowed
boat, in which were a number of
young people, steered by a benevolent
and elderly-looking man. Closely fol
lowing, and seemingly in pursuit of it,
came a second boat. streered by a
middle-aged man, and propelled by
two sturdy young men.
"Well! If there ain't Nellie Barnes
and Dick Wilson running away to get
married!" exclaimed one of the fisher
men.
"And there goes old man Roche,
Nellie's stepfather, in pursuit. Now,
won't Rome howl?"
"I bet on the lovely bride!"
"And I on the stern parent!"'
"Come, boys, come! Jump into the
boat and let's see the fun out."
Dick Wilson's father had died some
years ago, and left his son a fine farm
of one hundred and fifty acres. Ad
joining the Wilson farm was that of
John Roche. For years there had been
bad blood between the neighbors. It
was all on account of a point of land
projecting into the Choptank. Both
Wilson and Roche claimed it, and when
it was taken to law, it was decided in
favor of Wilson. About two years ago
Roche married a pretty widow named
Blarnes. She had a daughter whose
name was Nellie. It was love on the
first sight when Dick and Nellie acci
dentally met in the church on the
mainland. From that time on the
affection grew stronger. They fondly
thought that no one knew it but them
selves, but they were mistaken, for
I -
TiEr eOOD PARSOII SAT I TRFI. TERt.
Mr. Roche had seen it at the very
start, and tried by every means tokeep
them separated.
Bunt love will always find a way.
Dick and Nellie put their heads to
gether one Sunday at church and
agreed to run away and get married on
the sly. And what was more fortunate
for them was the fact that the good
parson of the church resided on the
island and was in full sympathy with
the young couple.
The expectant bride was seated be
side her betrothed, near the middle of
the foremost boat. She was 6 spright
ly, beautifal, black-eyed young wom
an, whose cheeks rivaled the peach in
their color. There was a world of mis
chief lurking near her pretty month.
Bfat to-day her cheeks were pale with
pprehenston and her rsmiloes were sad.
The expectant g'roma was a stalwart

heavy mustache. And as he sat in the
boat he looked straight ahead.
He seemed perfectly cool, and ever
and anon, by means of a large bundle
which held the all-important veil and
wreath, tried to assure and comfort
Nellie with numerous squeezes of the
hand and endearing words, which he
fondly thought were not seen. But
such was not the case. For the gig
gling, sharp-eyed bridesmaids, ,who
were seated in the bow of the boat,
discovered them. They revealed their
knowledge by numerous outbursts of
laughter in the intervals left from
charming the young rowers by their
conversation.
The good parson was the elderly
man, and he it was who would tie the
knot. He sat in the stern, steering
with studied precision.
And as the second boat approached.
Mr. Roche arose from his seat, and
cried,with a string of oaths:
"What do you mean, Dick Wilson, by
stealing my girl?"
"'I'm not stealing her." Dick replied.
"She comes of her own free will, and
with her mother's consent. You've
nothing against me in reason, and, be
sides, she's of age."
This was followed by outbursts of
laughter and hurrahs from the boys in
the boat. The only thing Mr. Roche
did was to glare and swear. After re
covering himself, he finally said:
"I have this against you. that you're
your father's son, and you'll not have
Nell. I'm the head of the house.
Come out of that boat, Nell. or I'll
shoot."
At these words he leveled a shotgun
at Dick. Nellie _reamed with terror.
"Oh! Dick, let me go to him or he will
kill you!"
"He'd like to, no doubt," said Dick,
"but he's afraid of shooting the rest,
and, besides, he's too much of a cow
ard. Do you think I'll give you up,
darling, with the happiness that will
be ours so near!" The last sentence
was uttered to her alone, but the party
heard the rest, and cheered him as be
fore. But though they laughed, they
did not cease rowing. Yet, they did
not increase their lead, for the Roche
boys pulled as lustily as ever.
"Once more I say stop and give her
up or I'll fire in another minute."
roared Roche again.
What the issue might have been it is
impossible to say, but in their excite
ment neither party had paid any at
THlE GOOD PARSON" C('OMMENCED THE CER

tention-at least the Roches had not
to the fishermen's boat. For, just as
hia sons had by extraordinary efforts al
most touched the bridal boat, his boat
dashed plump against their prow and
overturned their craft in a second.
HNow's our chance," cried Dick, and
away they sped.
'Meanwhile Roche and his sons. who
all swam like fish, showered angry im
precations upon the awkward fisher
men. The latter apologized profusely,
and helped to right the boat. They
had no idea but what they could pass
between the boats; just did it for a lark,
etc. Roche threatened dire vengeance
on all of them, but his gun was now
tranquilly reposing on the white sands,
twenty feet below. There was no time
to be lost, since the fugitives were now
nearly across, and Roche and his party
soon left the fishermen far behind.
The bridal party saw them coming,
and their triumph bade fair to be short
lived. However, the parson took the
dilemma by the horns.
"Children," said he, "it'san irregular
thing to do, though perfectly legal;
but I propose to marry you right here
and now. That old fellow will not be
ten minutes behind us when we reach
the shore. and, besides, those boys
have pistols."
"Oh. parson. you surely would not
spoil a wedding like that," said the
younger bridesmaid.
"fMy dear. I can bindl their hearts
and hands just as firmly under this
blue sky as in the most holy church
ever built'
So Nellie was assisted to arise and
was helped in her efforts by the steady
ing arm of Dick. As she stood in the
middle of the boat. under the clear
skvy. she made a demure-looking bride.
The roses came back to her cheeks,
and she was herself once more.
As the good parson commenced the
ceremony. one of the bridesmaids man
aged to put the wreath and veil upon
Nellie. Although it was somewhat
ruffed. it made quite a pretty appear
ance. The parson afterwards remarked
that it was the shortest marriage cere
mony in his experience. Vhen they
reached the shore a carriage was wait
ing there before the church in which the
ceremony was to have taken place. It
was a work of a few moments to get
into the carriage and drive to the
steamer. which was about to leave.
.Tust as the steamer pulled out M1r.
Roche and his sons, looking a little
the worse for wear from their bath,
struggled up from the beach. They
were just in time to see N-ellie waving
her handkerchief from the lower deck.
And the race for the bride had been
won.-St. Louis Republic.

MINER'S SUPERSTITIONS.
Oe. at Them H ae to Do With Strikes Dis
emvered oe a Friday.
Superititions of miners are among
the curiosities of mental phenomena
which are past finding out, as witness
a scrap of conversation in Creede camp
one evening recently:
"IHallo, Dave! That strike at the
'Dug Out' is a big thing. Just bin up
there."
"No good, Charley. It hoodoed it
self," was the reply.
"In what style?"
"It were a Friday job. Pay dirt on
Friday are a devil's gift."
"Onless there's a heap of it. Then
it'll do."
"The more there is. the worse for
the finders," objected Dave. "'It cusses
'em all the more. Over on Crip [the
short name for Cripple creekj a fat
streak was struck in the Davis mine
one Friday morning. None of the boys
thought what day it was, they were so
tickled, but after doing a little work to
find out if it was the real cream, they
all got blind drunk and kept tanked
up full for a week. .ust a week, and
it was Friday when they got back to
work, you see."
"'Had anybody stolen the mine?'"
"Not yet. It were all there, and as
they went further in it got better'n
better. In ten weeks they took off
forty-six wagon loads to the mills. and
it gin 'em back silver worth ninety
flue thousand dollars. The owners
'lowed they could take it to Denver
better'n to send it by express, and they
hired a car over to the Springs and had
the pure stuff loaded in. Then they
stayed there till two in the morning to
guard it. Jest then along came a lot
of 'agents' with mules and carts and
carried off about half the bars, and
left the three fellers tied and gagged,
locked in the car."
"You don't say that 'agents' carried
off a ton 'n a half of silver?"
"Certain and sure. Ycu see, part of
em was galoots from the mill and
knew all about how things was fixed,
and I heern part was from the sheriffs
office to keep order and see there was a
fair divide. lost anybody could be a
agent in them times."
"WVell?"
"Yes, and that hold-up was a Friday
morning. They got to Denver with
the other half of the stuf, got a re
ceipt for it and sold her at a big shave.
I reckon they got pretty nigh 030,000,
but it didn't do 'em no good. They
had worked hard and kep' sobera good
while, and wanted a. little blow-out.
They started in by getting too drunk
for any use, and that made 'em too
rich for any sense, so they began to
speckelate in the fare and monte busi
ness, and in two weeks they were
cleaned out. One sobered up afore the
others, and he had about one hundred
dollars left. and they got back to the
'Davis' one Friday night looking like
three old bums."
"But there was good stuff left there
yet."
"':)h, plenty. It were good for big
money, but the boys was in debt con
siderable. and so they had to mortgage
her. Some fellow there was always
looking for a chance like that. They
paid their little debts and worked hard
for a week. Then they had a fight
among theirselves, and two knocked
off work and got drunk. T'other stuck
to biz a few days and then he got
drunk. Pretty soon things got so bad
nobody'd trust 'em. and when the
mortgage come due the Davis was sold
meas'ly cheap. Some spec'lators got
her, and they took out pretty nigh on
to six million dollars before she gin
out."

•VENTILATION OF SEWERS.
oew to Prevent Ceontamination of the
Houon Air.
The modern sanitarians agree that
there is little dependence to be placed
on the orinary sewer trap as a means
of keeping sewer gas out of the house.
The chief means of surety lie in thor
ough ventilation. The ordinary house
sewer should measure four inches and
no more, because a larger pipe is not
so easily or thoroughly flushed out in
every part as a smaller pipe. The pipe
should be ventilated just outside the
house or at its lower end. and the pipe
should be extended its full length to at
least eight or nine inches above the
peak of the roof, and capped by a regu
lar ventilating plow. By this means air
will be continually pumped through the
pipe. There are a multitude of patent
devices that save plumbers work, and
are supposed to take the place of this
simple method of ventilation, but all
are makeshifts. I)o not let the plumb
er persuade you that it is not necessa
ry to extend the pipe its full size, but
that a two-inch pipe wvill do for venti
lation. It costs but little more to ex
tend the pipe to the roof in full four
inch size. Now, that nearly every vil
lage has a system of sewerage and a
water supply, it is especially necessary
that all persons understand that safety
from sewer gas is not in shutting it out
by water trap. but in purifying it by
the introduction of a current of pure
air. Main sewers should be as thor
oughly ventilated as house sewers, as
the simplest precaution against the
dangerous accumulation of gas. Yet
this is too often neglected.--N. Y.

TE:N-MINUTE EXERCISES
If Takena very Slay Thley Make Wemaee
Leook Trmly eeatfeal.
Everything in a woman's life should
be done temperstaly, especially the
wearing of corses. This eternal lec
turing upon the evils of corset-wearing
is all folly; to condemn tight lacing is
another thing, but the loose, wide
anade corset is to be commended.
Of course all exercise should be taken
with the waist perfectly free, and when
vigorous out-of-door sports are indulged
in no stay should be worn; but when in
the street or at home or at social func
tions the corset worn sensibly is a ne
cessty of all women who claim any de
gree of that intangible something called
style.
The rules for health and beauty are
really very simple. Rise a half-hour
before breakfast, open the window,
whavever the weather or season, and
SUPPLING TUE WAIST.
go briskly through the ordinary calis
thenic exercises with the arms and legs
and body for ten minutes-no longer,
for the half-hour of rigorous exercise
which some advocate is trying to the
nerves and taxes a woman's strength
altogether too much; even five minutes
may be found sufficient day after day.
The motions should be made evenly,
firmly and with sufficient rapidity to
get up a pleasant warmth.
The lungs should be filled through
the nose with fresh air from the win
dow and emptied through the mouth
with a quick ejection. This should be
done four or five times. Then the po
sition should be taken for the exercises
-legs together, hands on the hips and
chin held up. Then a rotation of the
body as in the first illustration. This
tends to make the waist slim and mo
bile, and the muscles may be felt al
ternately stretching and relaxing un
der the hands as the motion is de
scribed.
The second sketch illustrates the
exercise for widening the chest, in
creasing its bust and strengthening and
knitting the spinal muscles generally.
The other exercises to be taken are
made according to the well-known rou
tine, hands from shoulder up, ten times,
then down, then from the shoulder
straight out in front the same number
of times. All these should be done
briskly.
After the exercise a cold sponge bath
should be taken, accompanied by vigor
ous rubbing, and every other week a
cupful of common salt should be
thrown into the water each day, and
when this is used it must be remem
bered that soap cannot be used, as the
two (o iot agree.
After dressing slowly a breakfast
should be eaten of fresh fruit. grain
foods and eggs or chops, according to
one's taste.
At night. Just before retiring, the
same exercise should be gone through
and a sponge wet with alcohol rubbed
over the body; bathing the feet in
warm, almost hot, water is soothing
and healthy also. as it helps one to
sleep soundly and sweetly.
To give a woman an erect and beauti
ful figure there is no surer way than to

stand with the hands on the hips as
often as possible. with the abdomen in
anul the chest thrown well out. When
one is at home it is easy to stand in this
way for several minutes at a time or to
walk about the house so. It works
like magic, too, for giving one a fine
carriage.
It is perhaps unnecessary to add that
all the walking in the open air one can
posasibly do, unless it is in the hot sun,
serves to add to one's health and
beauty, anind a woman should be out of
doors all that she possibly can. as noth
ing brings the bloom into her cheleks
so quickly or so beautifully as God's
pure air and sunshine.-M3arie Jonrean,

Keep All Food Cevered.
Every article of food should be Ikept
covered until it appears on the table.
Milk and butter should be kept in air
tight covered vessels. They take up
every odor flying in the air, and are
positively harmf.l to the stomach after
standing uncovered for an hour or t wo.
Not only odors, but the animalculs

Harriet HoltCoahorn says that woem

reals character more than any of her
possessions, and I could almost tell her
fortune by looking into it. Is it a pot
pourri-gloves, laces, hairpins, frizzes,
collars, letters and a hundred other
things? This denotes an uneven, an
systematised, happy-go-lucky life. one
that fate loves to pursue. The orderly
woman who establishes a standard for
people to live up to always keeps this
bureau drawer in order. Ier life is of
the tranquil kind. The woman who
fills her bureau with boxes possesses an
excess of order that makes life a burden
to the ones who live with her. She to

you a personality which you do not pos
seas, and pose successfully for what you
are not; you can buy correct books and
pose for a litterateur by living up to
their bindings. In your house and its
furnishings you can buy artistic effect
and harmony of color and grand pic
tures, and even the atmosphere that
belongs with these evidences of culture
will hover about. You can have a Louis
Quinze room without knowingwhy yon
have it, and you can buy your coat of
arms and your antiques and your an

all that they represent and the world
will be none the wiser. But let the
world have a peep in the top drawer of
your dressing table and it will find out
things about your real character of
which it has never dreamed.-Philadel

A standing work basket is such a
comfort when one sits down to mend or
sew. First of all, because it is more
capacionu than the ordinary little
basket. Then it is such an independent
sort of an institution, being able to
stand alone, that it quite relieves its

owner of the many little attentions she
must bestow on the unpretentious
small basket. A very convenient and
attractive basket may be made at
home, using twwo peach baskets, as
shown in cut. The lower one may be
left unfinished inside, merely serving
as a support. The upper one should be
lined inside. and furnished with nu
merous pockets and a cushion or two
for needles and pins. Cover the out
side with pretty cretonne or silkoline,
putting a band and bow where the two
baskets meet. The top is made of a
long, straight piece of the right width
to gather up in the center with a draw
string, the other edge being fastened
under the upper frill. The draw
string should be long enough to let all
the fullness out, so that the top may
be turned down on the outside when
the basket is in use.-Rural New

INTRODUCE THEM.
voyr and Girls Should B. Preseast
I ormnally to Adult Vasitors.
It is a common oversight in too many
households not to introduce the chil
dren to visitors. Guests are formally
presented to the adult members of the
family, but the younger boys and girls
are either ignored altogether, or else
introduced in a general way without
giving their individual names. This
course is almost certain to result in
awkwardness and constraint on their
part when grown. There is a differ
ence between putting children forward
unduly aund giving them their just meed
of recognition. And pray take pains,
in making introduct ions, to speak the
names dlistinctly. and. above all things
else, do not omit t heir mention. How

a hostess greet an intimate friend. to

So great is the rivalry among the
owners of fine chafing dishes and choice
recipes to be cooked in them that
cooking clubs. of both men and women,
frequently meet and prepare a luncheon
or ten o'clock supper entirely over the
chafing dish. Each person brings or
sends his dish and the materials for
making it in advance, and the feast is
