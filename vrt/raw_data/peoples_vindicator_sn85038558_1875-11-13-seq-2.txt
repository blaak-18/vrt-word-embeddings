Hard Money end IMeoCilloah.
Hugh McCullouch, who seems, in
th eyes of the New York financiers,
-. to be a little God, if not a large one,
on money matters, has, after muhn
labor and many twisting., Jis ued a
i. letter, which is publisbed in the New
York Tribune, Oct. 21st, annunciating
his views upon the present financial
difficulties.
The reasoning in the major part of
the article is good, as far as it re
lstes to a diagnosis of the diseased
Sencurrency; but when a remedy is spo
ken of, Mr. McCullouch misses the
' mark entirely. ...
a We conceive that the ez.Treassrer
Idoes not mean what he says. He is
ir too astute a financier for such to be
the ecase. 1,
In stating that the proper way to
resume specie payments was to re
d deem all outstanding legal tenders
n. with 4} per cent bonds, is ,too child
elal to be attributed to Mr. McCullouch
a as his real meaning. He fluctuates,
i evidently, between his own convie
r tlons, as well as that of every well
' thinking man, and a puling policy,
else be has shamefully chosen to be
.'tcome the champion of bond holders,
r as opposed to tax payers, in the wat
ter, equaling almost the juvenile
fully of the last Coogress in enacting
the reisamption:law to apply in 1879.
a What Mr. McCullouch proposes to
do to, remedy the evil and satisfy the
demand, is simply this and nothing
more.
°. Mr. MLeCulloch's idea of specie, is
•. hard coin of the .reall--Well awl good;
and to give thdi to the people he pro.
poses to redeem a eircdalisy gsdisu.
now in e4stice,, not by a wirie, jqdi
cleious and statesmanlike coarse, but
Sby issuing bonds for fhat amount,
bearing 4 to 5 per eet iterest--thus
heaping a tax upon the people of over
"18,000,000, (eighteen millions) per
year, and this indefinitely. In othe
words, we have out- *400,000,000,
about, iln i~i tender, :whlict o . tap
bear interet; lhe proposes to take
these in and issue bonds that do bear
haterest, in their stead. Snpposing
" these bonds to lave 30 years to run,
the ti payers at the end ofthalt term
will have the pleasure. of redeeming
those bonds augmented i $540,000,
000 interest..
This won't do; it is not tlnaneier
nlug to thue dodge around, the point,
and.we ate sorry ,to have seen Mr.
PeCoofloch do so. He has lately
travelled li Edtrop and his interest
ing letters upon the financial raan
a gement of its respectnve governments
show him ,to have observed closely
t and : studie' them well. We" are

r The Radical organs in Louisiana, it

speak of benaets to accrue to the tax
payer or p.e1e by the continuance
of their party ina power, and perhaps
they should not, as their past aets will

snot one act of good can be enumera
