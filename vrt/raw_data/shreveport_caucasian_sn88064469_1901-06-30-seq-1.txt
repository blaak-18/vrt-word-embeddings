rthe Teachers and the Petition
Kooti, g full well ghat the Clucasian
has a.ss betn a strong Irtend and
worker tor the jublic schools of Shreve
port, aid, wile 3aving labored in seison
and ou. lt rb.sa8 n lor their building up
ard sustiiinUg them, rot only for the edu
cation eo ttle rislrg gtLcerition, yet has
helped with pen and hands to supply them
with good, ccmfortable bull ingy in whisk
to h u e both teacner and t upil.
There is one tbhig for which it has been
at all times n rre ciutspotcn and that is
justice and esmpathy for the hare.-worked
teachers of our Public school.
I have retereLoe to the request or or-er
from the School Board, that the teachets
circulate a petition and secure the f gna
tures of texpayers for the purpose of as
election at which to vote a tax for the
huilding d: more school houses.
It does not occur to my mind that the
School Board have even stepped to think a
moment about the hardship they wuLid
impose on those laithflu Letchter who
have for nine lens nLor.ths so faithfully
discharjged their duties. The reeoaLt clos
Ing exercises at out High School building
gave most satisfactory evidence to my
mind as a patron of the schoot,
and I left piou- of the magnallcent show
ing that was mace, but just as the poor
tired teachers ate about to struggle
thr ug!:vut tue Nu mal buomer schoo',
here conmte an o der, touched fu the
ao3 1.-Le (: °. Iquest, that the teacbcis
go gatavauttig trom hcu-e to house wfth
copies of this pet.tion to secure the signs
Ltres of t xpayera for the zurpose o
Voting a tax for buildieg more school
bouses.
Why ask those teachers to do this ?
Macv of chom worked with might and
main to secule our preItcIt HIgh Schoot
building.
All of the teachers gave evidence of
being tired, acd many of them said to me,
"'We feel that we could not go another
week without a case of nervous Lrostra
tion; we Lope: however, to go through the
hot month of the hormal, and then, if
there is an} thing left of us we will try and
seek a cool letreat end rest until we must
resume our work in the fall."
It can not be that the School Board think
that for the meagre salary that the teaches
receive that they are absolute masters and
the teachers,. the servants to carry out
every scheme that may come In their
brain. I for one cannot believe this; I
think rather they have neier looked at the
matter from the right standpoint.
Now, gentlemen of the School Board,
don't impose or try to have your worthy
tesonets perform this work. Do like every
other public body does-seek out a few
able bodied men who can go through this
burning sun to make your oanvass, and
pay them for thei work, sand say to your
teachers, "We were wrong is wasting you
to do this: go and take your recreation for
the remainder of the summer, and eaem
back to your work strong and invigorated
ready to en thlrugh another year to the
trsanai. , .a boLfys ad girls to be in the
Iutur men sand women of Shrevper.
