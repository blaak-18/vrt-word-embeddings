NOT FINISHED.
Forty-Eight Pages of the Sundry *ivit
Bill to Be Disposed O$
Washington, Feb. 13.-The house
made slow progress with the sundry
civil bill Thursday; only twenty-seven
pages, and leaving forty-eight still to
be disposed of. The delays Thursday
were occasioned by a rather protracted
discussion of the item in the bill for
the maintenance of the white house and
considerable debate upon the item
of $3,00.0,00 for the relief of distress
in the Philippines. Mr. Gaines (Dem.)
of Tennessee and Mr. Fitzgerald
(Dem.* of New Yors criticised the
greatly increased cost of maintaining
the white house. An amendment to
cut in half the appropriation for the
relief of distress in the Philippines
was defeated, but the language of the
paragraph was modified to require an
nual reports of the expenditure of
money.
Statehootl Hill as a Rider
Washington, Feb.' 13.-The friends
of the statehood bill reached a definite
decision to have the omnibus statehood
bill reported as a rider to the post
office appropriation bill. It is the pur
pose to make a fight in the senate to
have the statehood bill tacked on to
one of the appropriation bills whose
passage is absolutely necessary to the
running of the government.
SIGNING OF PROTOCOLS.
They Provide fair the Raising of the
Blockade Immediately.
Washington, Feb. ls.--Mr. Bowen
has had a busy day conferring with
the Englisf and Italian ambassadors
and the German minister regarding the
various features of tee protocols with
the result that they are practically in
final shape.
The signing of the protocols will, it
is expected, be done at the British em
bassy, as it is regarded rather impru
dent for Sir Micnael Herbert to ven
ture out on account, of his illness.
The protocols will provide for the
raising of the blockade at once for
a cash payment of 5,500 pounds to each
of the three allied governments, and
for the payment to Germany of 1,700,
000 bolivars in five installments less
5,500 pounds paid in cash. The first
installment of the ,dt00000 bolivars or.
$340.000 is to be paid on the 15th of
March. The protocols also will pro

W. C. Whitney's
New
Country Home
[Special Correspondence.]
W'estbury, N. Y., Feb. i.--The recent
exhibition in New York of a beautiful
stained glass window by ba Farge
has directed much attention toward I
the new country home of forincwr Sec
retary of the Navy W. *. h'litney.
where the La Farge window has found
an abiding place. The Whitney man
sion is at Wheatley Hills. not far from
here, and is one of the largest manors
on Long Island. Yet it is so sheltered
by its surroundings, which are well
wooded, that one is almost upon it be
fore noticing it.
An inspection at (lose quarters will
disclose the fact that the entrance hall
is about the most notable feature of
what is throughout a beautiful and
elaborately decorated house. The hall
is large and lofty, a worthy reposi
tory for the Italian renaissance wood
work with which it is being decorated.
It also contains two La Farge win
dows, the one lately sxhibited and a
companion piece tha ' was ·xecuted
some months ago. Both windows are I
remarkable as examples of delicate
workmanship. The lead is applied in
some places so nicely that it is not vis
ible at first glance, and the windows
are incased in sheets of glass, which
serve still .rther to tone the delicate
covering.
The mansion is of 1'ick, ar1 the air
of an English manor house is con
veyed not only by its deep coloring,
but by its many gables and deep eaves. i
Everything possible has been done in
the exterior construction to take away
from it as much as possible the ap
pearance of newness. Antique oak
is freely used in the trimmings of the
veranda. The shingles are dark, the
blinds finished in dull colors. In fact,
the ensemble is such as to make the
tones of the house harmonize with the
surrounding woods and their glorious
shadows.
Like all the great country estates
near New York. the Whitney place is
intended for more than a summer resi
dence and has been built so substan
tially that it is fully as comfortable in
winter as in summer. Indeed, country
life in America no longer means life in
the country during the sultry months;
it continues, with a few breaks, all the
year round. At the Whitney home
house parties are given both winter
and summer, Mr. Whitney's lavish hos

RESIDENCE.
pitality being proverbial. The interior
furnishings of the place, while costly,
are sensible, and one finds furniture
that can be used as well as admired. So
even more remarkable than the manor
itself are the stables connected with it.
Mr. Whitney's great hobby Is horse
racing, and at WVheatley Hills he has
built veritable palaces for his equine
pets. The stables here are contained in
what has the appearance of being a
huge Swiss structure, 800 feet in length
and 415 feet in width, with an extension
50 feet by 90 feet. This structure stands
midway on a gentle slope falling
toward the lowlands of the Hempstead
plains and is so built that on fair days
in winter the sun is never off the stalls,
its rays being admitted to them by
glass half doors.
The stalls, eighty in number, are of
themselves worth attention. They are
of the species known as box and are 20
feet long, 25 feet wide and 10 feet; ;.
iNo stall is exposed to the weather in
any way, for back of each is a passage
twenty feet wide between the walls of
the stall and the walls of the building.
Pine and spruce are used in the wood
work. the stall flooring being of dry,
hard packed earth.
On either side. as one enters the'sta
ble, are two comfortable offices, one for
the head sfableman and the other for
the veterinary. In the extension is a
big harness room. and on the boor
above quarters for the hundred or more
stablemen and boys who are kept busy
until the horses are taken away for the
racing season. On this floor, too, are a
gymnasium, a library, a huge kitchen
and a big cold storage room. An at
tractive cottage for the trainer is near
the stables. In fact, nothing has been
left undone to make the employees and
their charges as comfortable as possi
ble.
As is to be expected, the estate also
boasts a private race track. This is a
mile long, the first quarter mile being
straightaway. There is also a private
steeplechase course, one of the finest in
the country.. In addition to these Mr.
Whitney has had an excellent golf
course laid out, and has built a private
gymnasium and squash courts for the
use of the family and visitors.
What may be termed the landmark
of the place is a huge windmill. As a
matter of fact, this is tl:e only feature
of the estate. nothible from ainy dis
tance, so thickly wooded is the country.
The windmill is 175 feet high and
stands on a lofty elevation. so that it is
one of the most conspicuous objects of
this sbetion of lrnr Island. ,

BASKET WORK.
as the balance wheel or as the wind
mill pattern is best worked out in two
colors.
Beginners should be content to ac
quire the stitch of raffia basket making
in one color before they plunge into
patterns. When one has learned to
make a respectable basket in natural
colored raffia, then something simple
in two colors can be taken up. This
mode of practice leads one up to the
intricacies of the joyful art of raffia
basketry with few regrets and with
far more expedition than the mode of
beginning with the thing at the wrong
end and having to come all the way
back again.
But whether one is an expert or an
amateur she will find her greatest joy
in designing her own patterns, and by
resorting to the little device here point
ed out it will be found that a knowl
edge of drawing is not at all necessary
in arranging a very respectable pat
tern design.
High Heels and a "Finished" Step.
A young lady vehemently defends
the use of high heels. She maintains
that they are much more in accordance
with the laws of nature than heavy,
stodgy, so called "colnmon sense" shoe
heels. "All the 'finishing schools' which
teach young women how to attain a
graceful carriage," she says, "have
one inexorable law that is dinned intoe
one's ears morning, noon and night.
'Do keep 6ff your heels. my dear,' or
what is the same thing. 'Walk more
lightly, Miss Blank.' And when you
step lightly you invariably rise on your
toes more. Try it yourself and see. If
you will keep an eye on your low
heeled girl you will see that her move
ments are anything but graceful. The
reason lies in what I have.,told you.
She settles back on her low heels, and
the result i, a logy. stodgy, stiff and
uncomfortable gait."--Exchange.
Ever Ready Thickening For Sauce.
A paste for thickening sauces may be
kept at haxdl for constant use. Here is
the way to make one that will keep a
long time: Cut equal amounts of beef,
veal and polk suet in small pieces; put
them in a kettle with very little water
and slowly render. Turn off the first
fat and when very hot stir in flour un
til it forms a thick paste, about one
pint of flour to a pirt of liquidt fat. P..
these into r gralitcwrare vessel and
place in an oven and cook three to four
hours. Keep in glass jars covered.
