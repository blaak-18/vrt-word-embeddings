The Hearst Pribate Theatrical Performance
‘•Come in and be a delegate,” the eager
Hearstite cried;
“But I’m not on the pay-roll, Sir,” I timidly
replied.
“We’ll PUT you there,” the Hearstite said;
“the boss is happy to be bled.”
So, tugging at my collar, he dragged me clear
inside.
“Now, let me see, you’ll have to
be a delegate from Maine.”
“But I am from Nevada, Sir,” I
hastened to explain.
“Oh, never mind about the State;
our William Randolph pays the
freight!
Check your conscience in the
cloak-room, and hurry out
again. ’ ’

“Why all these empty seats and
aisles'?” I queried anxiously.
“Oh, they’ll not show in the pic
ture!” said the Hearstite cheer
ily;
“We’ll make a few small passes
now, report it as a big pow-wow,
The public’ll never know the dif
ference, you see.”

“And who are these brave gentle
men my vision has just sighted?
‘The editorial staff,’ you say? I’m
sure I am delighted!
A glorious, united band! And
might I grasp them by the
hand ? ’ ’
“Nay, be not free with them,” he
warned. “Hearst has ’em
copyrighted! ’ ’
Soon a very dusky delegate, from
‘ ‘ Afric’s coral strand, ’ ’
Harangued us on equality, high on
the speaker’s stand;
I thought they’d surely chase him
hence; but no, they cheered his
“eloquence,”
And hailed him as a brother and a leader in
command!

“Now, what about the platform, Sirs?” I
asked the Hearstite folk.
They doubled up, and roared with mirth, and
gave their knees a stroke:
“Why, Hearst has got it all arranged—this
innocent would have it changed!”
They cried, “Well now, that’s what we call
a rare and racy joke!”
Atlanta, Ga., Tl % August 13, 1908.
I asked about the candidates —and got a
meaning wink.
They siaid: “Our little William R. has put
them on the blink;
We’re here today to nominate a nice, dictated
candidate.
If you’ve a different idea —just take another
think!”

“Then why are we convening here?” I asked
them, in disgust.
“Why, that is very simple—’t is ’cause Wil
lie says we must;
We’re paid to raise a little Cain, to start a
copyright campaign,
We need it in the business of the Hearst
Newspaper Trust! ’ ’

Oh, come and be a delegate and bring your
wife along;
And fetch your cousins and your aunts to
swell the grand sweet song!
And take the kids away from play, they’ll
help to fill up space,
And yank the baby from its crib, and let it
have a place.
Go hire some thugs at so much per to do the
bouncer act,
In case our independent (?) prin-
ciples should be attacked;
We are a patriotic crew, in purity
immersed,
All clinging to the pay-roll of Har
riman and Hearst!

That ‘ ‘ Independence Conven
tion” was about the sickliest, sor
riest effort to perpetrate a decep
tion upon the public that has ever
been pulled off by that monumen
tal advertiser of an insignificant
personality William Randolph
Hearst.

The word was passed out to the
pay-rollers to attend that meeting,
and bring their families so as to
make “a large and enthusiastic
gathering.” The result was about
as cheerful and spontaneous as
the meeting of the creditors of a
bankrupt—and the motive much
the same; each was there because
his own interests demanded his
presence at the irksome ordeal.
They scented a pork-barrel from
afar and came to get a lick at the
bacon. Those coming any dis
tance were in the minority, how
ever. Men employed in the Hearst
newspaper plant at Chicago were
there as delegates representing
States like Missouri and Ken
tucky! Men known to be in the
employ of Hearst in New York
State were there with badges. And
in the face of these facts, John
Temple Graves, in an article pub-
lished in the New York Journal on August
1, naively remarks: “Os the delegates pres
ent from all sections, from every state, from
all races, Caucasian, AFRICAN and Indian
—among all these, there was not present a
man directly or indirectly connected with the
Hearst newspapers! ’ ’
Who could have deceived John Temple
thus?
Probably considering he had better confess
