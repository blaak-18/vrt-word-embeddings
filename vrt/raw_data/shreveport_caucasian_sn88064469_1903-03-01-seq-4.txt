THE PRIMA\RY VERSUS THE
CONVENTION METHOD.,
Apropos the disctission of the primary
versus the convention method of nomi
nating the next State ticket, there is
one point which has nct received the
attention it deserves and that is the
basis of representation provided by the
Constitution of 1898 for all nominating
conventions held in this State. Under
the Constitution, representation in all
nominating conventions must be based
upon population instead of upon party
strength. With such a basis of represen
tation, it seems to us, that it is impos
bible to hold a fair nominating conven
tion, no matter how fairly the delegates
might be chosen. A convention with the
delegates chosen by a white primary
would be better than a convention with
the gelegates chosen by a mass meeting
and appointed by parish committees;
but the unjust and unfair basis of rep
resentation would still prevail; the large
negro parishes with few Democratic
voters would. have larger delegations
than many of the white parishes with
several times as much strength. We do
not understand why such a provision
should have been inserted in the Con
stitution, but as long as it is there, it
must be obeyed, and no fair nominating
convention can be held.-Guardian
Journal.
The question raised by the Cuardian
Journal, published in Homer, Claiborne
parish, a parish where the whites are in
the majority, that the basis of delegates
to a convention is unjust and unfair and
ithe large negro parishes with few Dem-'
ocratic voters would have larger dele
gations than many of the white par
ishes with several times as much
strength" should be considered seriously
by every Democrat not allied to or con
nected with ."the machine."
It may be said that the adoption of
Article 2oo by the framers of the Con
stitution, of x898 is a political enigma
which must remain tjnsolved. This arti
ce declares that, "in all political con
..vetios.. in this State the apportion
ent. of representation shall be on the
bbads 1. population.".Agy man of any

WHO IS THE BOSS?
in a recent issue the Harlequin. pub
lished in New Orleans. queried: "Who
is the boss?" and then queried: "Are
we to have possession," and then an
swering the query said: "If not, who is
going to boss the thing?" The Caucas
ian is concerned in the last interroga
tion as it is in the second. but as who
is the boss, well, it has long been said
and it is accepted as a fact that Murphy
J. has been the boss, the man who has
fixed the triggers and pulled the strings
to suit his notions. Without digressing
we will say that if we were in Morphy
J's place we would probably set our po
litical triggers and pull 'em as Murphy
J. is credited with their setting and
pulling. In our opinion Murphy J. is one
of the most astute and smoothest of poli
ticians in the State, but to our subject:
"Who is the boss?" We (us) the people
should be the boss and as the boss we
desire to know how and where stand the
several gentlemen who are ready to sac
rifice themselves (figuratively) on the
altar of liberty if they can secure the
governorship. It has been said that in
New Orleans or in Baton Rouge is lo
cated the gubernatorial incubator and
that no others need apply, if they be not
of the chosen few. However, that is of
little import since the question with (us)
and we, the dear people, is not so much
the "governor" as to his policy or the
policy which the "incubator" may design
and devise. If we could forecast the "in
cubator" we wouldn't care a continental
for the governor. We have long since
recognized the necessity of a "boss." In
deed, in some things (we) are a boss and
anything without a boss must go awry.
The people are the boss but do not know
it and realize their power, when too late
and do their bossing after they have been
bossed politically. Here is where we
stand:
We are in favor of nominations by
primary elections against conventions,
which are loaded, fixed as programmed
and fired off with a "hip, hip hurrah"
under the strains of the Star Spangled
Banner or the "Girl I Left Behind me:"
Buit the bosses will descant and declare
that we, are crazy. So be it, but the ma
jority of )emocrats in North Louisiana
who vote are opposed to conventions
ixtert make public- a pre-arranged po
ltisil Gjrogram. On that line a lively

The Governor of L-ouisiana is yesttd

'tate inthe Union has so great a power
of appointment as the Governor of
Louiiiaha, This power was vested in the
~eecutive after the State had been rp
deemed from the political vampires and
thieves who then held full sway, but
there is no longer necessity for such au
thority which should be re-vested in the
people. Why should the governor be au
thorized to appoint assessors and other
officers who should be elected by the
people? Why place in the hands of the
governor any authority or power which
is reserved to and is of the people? If
a coterie of a few in New Orleans or
Baton Rouge are all-powerful, if these
few, can map out and declare the pol

THE IRISH LANGUAGE.
tts Effect on an Audience Described
by a South American.
Mr. William Bulfin, editor of the
Southern Cross. Buenos Ayres, recent
ly visited Ireland and attended a feis
ceoil given in the city of Galway. This
is what he says of Irish oratory in the
native tongue:
"I can only judge of it. unfortunate
ly, from two standpoints-the sound of
it and the effect it has upon an audi
ence. I heard several Irish addresses
at the feis. All were in the same
style. T!·i accent of all the speakers
was more or less the same. I learned,
too, that each speaker dealt in plain.
concise, practical ideas and expressed
them in terse and vigorous modern
Irish. So far so good. Here, then, is
a plain statement of how all this sound
ed to a plain man.
"At first the sound of Irish oratory
is a little harsh to the untrained and
unaccustomed ear, but this is only for
a moment. There is a deep note of pas
sionate earnestness in the rugged maj
esty of the words, and there is a
sledgehammer power in the sonorous
roll of the sentences. In the Irish there
are sounds as sUbilant as the Italian.
as mouth filling as the Spanish, as na
sal as the French, as guttural as the
German and as deep as the English.
But the language resembles none of
these. It appears to belong to another
sphere altogether. It seems to have
been coined laboriously by men who
had grand and great and glowing things
to say to each other. It bursts impet
uously in huge masses of sound through
the sense of hearing and knocks thun
derously at the heart and soul of a
man. And meantime it is not unmu
sical. It is not by any means flat or
sharp. But there is no fluting about it.
There is no whine in it. Its diapason
is essentially masculine. It is the big
organ among the languages,- with many
registers, able to run up and down the
gamut of human feeling and touch ev
ery responsible fiber of being and sound
the depths of joy and sorrow and
rouse to lofty passion and to the no
blest endeavor. This I say from atten
tively listening to the sound of the lan
guage and observing its effects upon
the audiences who understood it.
"In singing theIrish language is sin
gularly sweet. It is not the Italian
sweetness nor the German sweetness,
for the German in song is one of the
most musical languages. The sweet
ness in Irish song is unique, and you
cannot describe it. It has a wondrous
,appeal in it. At the feis the test song
in one of the competitions was 'Cuirl
hionn' (Coolin). When Caitilin Ni
Bhraonaln (Miss Kathle i Brennan),
sang it in the tradiitionat tyle, It pulled
you all tp pieces.

S Oom Paul's Dagly Habits.
SIn speaking of the, mode of life of
Paul Kruger at hi. secluded house on
tle French Riviera the ex-Boer presi
ent's housekeeper made-the following
outline of Oom Paul's daily habits:
"He rises at 5 a.. m.; no breakfast
never; reads the Bible until 8 o'clock;
at 10.0 he smokes his pipe for six min
utes; them people come to see him; at
12 sharp breakfast, lasting twenty min
utes; drinks nothing but milk; goes for
a drive between 1:3D and 2-30; sleeps
from 2 until 4:30; receives Boers and
reads Bible; dinner, at 6 sharp, also
twenty minutes. His prayer before and
after dinner is full of piety. The presi
dent goes to bed at 8:30 and is awak
ened at 11, when he-takes a cup of cof
fee, and again goes to sleep until 1. At
1 he eats some fruit."

In New Mexico are several settle ats

are, with pottery making, their chief
- remaining occupations. Their methods
of weaving show the effect of their as
sociation with the native Mexicans,
since they differ entirely from the
methods of the Navajoes, re-sembling
more those of the weavers in the in
terior of Mexico. The Navajoes weave
their blankets on an upright frame,
I whereas the Pueblos' loom is a huge
and cumbersome affair that to a cas
unal observer might readily be taken
for the framework of a little hut. The
weaver does his work standing in this
i loom, often two weavers working side
by side. With the.Navajoes the women
do all the weaving, but the higher civi
lization of the Pueblos is shown by the
fact that the men not only weave the
rugs, but prepare, clean and spin the
wool. The natives use only a high
grade of native wool for their blankets
and rugs. cut from the sheep or An
gora goat. The first process in prepar
ing the wool is to wash and cleanse it,
removing all natural grease and dirt.
This is dbne by hand, with the aid of
the "soap weed" root, until the wool
is as pure and clean as though it had
come fresh from a scouring mill.
Following the washing and drying
comes the carding. A crude handmade
carder is used, consisting of a.rough
piece of wood some nine inches square,
covered with rawhide and prepared for
its work by numerous nails driven in
and covering one side. These pull and
comb the wool until it is ready for
spinning. After spinning, it then goes
to be dyed with those fast colors pecul
iar to Indian workmanship. As a
study of the "handmade" these rugs
are interesting, for surely nothing could
be more entirely handmade, from start
to finish. The Indians do not hurry in
their rugmaking. Time is of little ob
ject to them. An Indian rug of heavy
weave will outlast the life of an aver
age man and is often so closely woven
as to hold water. Many a cowboy,
hard pressed for a bucket, has watered
his horse from his Indian blanket. A
weaver will spend days sometimes on
a single rug. Many of their patterns
and designs require twenty or thirty
changes in the running of a single
thread across the rug, and for each of
these changes there must be a change
in the shuttle used. In such cases the
,work becomes tedious. Pueblo rugs
bring good prices, and the humble
weaver with' few wants and luxuries
lives a comfortable, peaceful life in his
little adobe dwelling.-Housekeeper.
CO(seeea.e Money Ref.ed.

conscience has troubled me many times
since then, and, as I am now a good
Ch.astian, I want to return what I
cheated the government out of."
Mr. Goyne then saw that the woman
wanted to pay the difference between
firt and third class postage to a for
eign country, which amounted to a few
cents in this case.
"I'm sorry, but I cannot take the
money," he said tp the caller. He ex
plained that he would not know how to
put in his accounts to the department

probably would cost the postoffice many
times the sum for clerical work in re

Vegetarianism In Restaurants.
"Vegetable hash." read a patron in
a downtown restaurant, looking over
the bill of fare. "What next?"
"That's a concession to the vege
tarians," explained the manager. "Do
you know, there is an increasing ie
mand for vegetarian dishes, and we
are at our wits' end to know what to
serve.' This vegetable hash is a mix
ture of'potatoes, carrots, turnips, celery
and beets.
"Of course there is the inevitable
restaurant dish - beans, Boston and
New York style-and there is spaghet
tt, but to keep the custom of those who
taboo meats we have to contrive vari
ety for them. One new offering is po
tato cakes and poached eggs. Then
your vegetarian may eat celery salad,
tomato salad, fried sweet potatoes,
rice fritters, fried mush or potato cro
quettes.
"But this is a limited menu, and we
will hail as blessed the man or woman
who will invent new vegetarian dishles
which can be served in a quick lu:ch
place. The problem puzzles us."-New

Benton and His Wife.
Senator Benton of Missouri a
model of tenderness and devotio to
his invalid wife. It seems that dutng
her later years her mind beca-,e ;u.
paired by a paralytic stroke, b':t se
never failed to recognize her hu.- art
and was fond of being near him. Once
when her distinguished husband was
entertaining a foreign prince in the
drawing room Mrs. Benton came to
the door in a state of undress and
stood gazing at her husband. The at
tention of the company being attracted
in her direction, Benton turned to see
what the attraction was. On perceiv
ing his poor wife he immediately rose,
went to her, took her tenderly by the
hand and, leading her into the room,
said, "My dear, Prince So-and-so;
prince, Mrs. Benton, sir." Then af
fectionately placing a hassock for her
by the side of his chair he resumed
his seat, and, leaving one of his hands
in hers for her to toy with, he went on
with the conversation. The prince was
quick to take in the situation and
adapted himself to the occasion with
consummate tact, while all the Mis
sourians were deeply affected.
The Silk Hate Worn In London.
There are always two kinds of silk
hats, each of the best quality, on sale
in London. One is the strictly fashion
able model, "the latest," or whatever
one may choose to call. it, which is re
tailed in the west end at from a guinea
to 25 shillings. The other is the style
which immediately preceded it and has
"gone out." although the quality is un
changed. This is usually called the
"city" hat and costs 16 shillings. The
distinction is a very peculiar one. Em
ployees of large London commercial
houses are not expected to be up to the
hilt in fashion, and If they are it is
sure to be resented by their employers.
A. London city magnate would not be
seen wearing the same shape hat as
one of his bookkeepers, and so the
great army of salary drawers keep just
a shape behind the bondholding com
munity.
A Caution to Sweethearts.
In 1834 the Primitive Methodists of
Burnley issued an edict against Sun
day courting. They regarded it as so
serious an offense against the dignity
of the Sabbath that they actually pass
ed in solemn and sober earnest the fol
lowing stern and autocratic minute:
"That we do not allow young men and
young women of our society to court
with each other on Sunday; neither do
we allow our single men and women
to walk in the street together, arm in
arm, at any time; neither do we allow
them to stand at street corners chat
ting together."
Grant's Baggage.
General Grant always yielded in a
sort of whimsical way to his wife's
domination of himself and his affairs.
The "family" ran the household as it
pleased, withgut much reference to
General Grant's predilections. Once
at the railway station in Galena he
called the attention of a friend to a
truckload of trunks ready for shipment
east. "Do you see that pile?" he asked.
"That is the Grant bhggage. Do you
see that little black valise away up on
top? -That's mine."
Had It.
"Yes, it's a fine house, Mandy," ad
mitted the prim and. ngular Aunt Ra
chel, to whom all its magnificence
seemed a sinful waste of money, "and
I suppose there's really no room for

said her city niece, sho~ing her into
the elegant little apartment where she
usually dressed for dinner.--Chicago
