EVENTIDE.
The air grows cooler, and the light
Slants from the glowing west,
While on the cliff among the pines
The raven seeks her nest;
The plowman slops his weary team,
That toilsomely and slow,
Has turn’d the furrows all the day,
And now with heads hung low,
And reeking flanks, and traces slack,
Await, in patient mood,
The “taking out,” which means to
them
A time of rest and food.
The cows come slowly down the lane
And sigh in calm content,
Their rounded sides, replete with
food,
In curves of plenty bent.
Their udders full of foamy milk,
Insistent to escape,
While noisily, close in their wake,
With mouth and eyes agape,
And “make belief” at driving them,
In all his impish joy,
Comes one who makes the scene com
plete—
A healthy country boy.
The farm-house chimney belches
forth
The smoke of kitchen fire,
While to their coops the mother hens
With cheeping broods retire;
The calves are lowing in the pen,
The lambs are seen at play,
While from the stack-yard, close at
hand,
Comes fragrant scent of hay;
And country damsels, pail in hand,
Stand waiting at the gate,
The coming of their milchy charge,
In sweet coquettish state.
Long grow the shadows —longer still,
The sun is nearly gone,
And now behind the mountain tops,
Which glow as in the dawn,
He drops—the god of day is set —
The dew is falling fast,
The shadows darken into night—
Another day is past;
And Night, with sable brooding wing,
Shuts from the yearning sight
The scenes of plenty, love and peace,
Till morning brings the light.

FROM THE BREAD LINE.
I have read with a smile the letter
in the Jeffersonian for 'March 18 of
Mr. William A. Greene, of Ogle
thorpe, Ga., on the position of the un
employed. Mr. Greene takes it for
granted that anyone wanting work,
any one seeking work, can get it, and
he intimates his disbelief not only in
the existence of the Bread Line it
self, but in the honesty, sincerity and
worthiness of such Bread Line, grant
ing its existence.
I want to say to Mr. Greene, and
other doubters, that the Bread Line
is a stern reality,, mostly honest, ab
solutely sincere and dangerously hun
gry. This is hard to believe by a
strong, capable, proud, healthy man,
possesses his own land. When
worse comes to worst with such, he
pan always go out and till his soil,
pakc §ome sqrt of a living,

Conducted by Grace Kirkland
if not the best, but usually the very
best. But what of the men who own
nothing, save perhaps some furniture
and clothes, and, alas! alas! a fami
ly! Men who are caught in the mael
strow of a great city, where, under
normal conditions, all kinds of labor,
skilled and unskilled, is in constant
demand, and w r here one hundred
others are greedily waiting for such
positions as soon as those occupying
them for any reason drop out. Sup
pose normal conditions do not exist,
and through some industrial parox
ysm, thousands of men are thrown
out of work who hare saved nothing
for a rainy day out of salary barely
sufficient to meet the needs of a grow
ing family, in a climate where heavy
clothing and expensive fuel are neces
sities. What can be done by any of
these ? There is nc money with
which to defray expenses to other
points in search of work, even could
it be found there, for similar condi
tions are likely to exist m most cen
ters at the same time. In fact, al
most all cities now have a perpetual
army of unemployed. How are the
needs of a family to be met at such
a time? Many a philanthropist has
thought of and mentioned the wide
waste areas in fertile, sunny Florida,
and has dreamed an Utopian dream
of importing hither the hungry
hordes of some over populated city,
but the project has seldom got be
yond a dream, for there are some
real practical reasons that doom it
to failure.
Most men would rather bear the
ills they have than fly to others that
they know not of; so the clerk, the
factory hand, the machinist and other
skilled tradesmen turn their faces to
the roar and rage of the mighty city
that they know and understand, and
refuse to take the, to them, great risks
of a removal o a farm under condi
tions absolutely unfamiliar. If Mr.
Greene’s farm should become unpro
ductive, or he be unable from some
cause to operate it, would he consent
to go to China, or India, or Paris, or
London, to begin life over again at a
trade new and untried by him? No.
He’d wait for the next season to come
along, and eke out a miserable, wait
ing existence in the Bread Line first.
The Bread Line is a horrible real
ity, even to a man who is. supposed
to be “the arbiter of his own fate,”
and thousands of them are today
standing there, waiting, waiting al
most hopelessly for the pitiful mor
sel to take home to a shivering,
gaunt-eyed wife, and pale, ill-clad
children. He may be strong, healthy,
capable, honest, but not being in con
trol of industrial conditions, and hav
ing not a foot of land he can call his
own or even lease, he must take his
stand with the army of unemployed,
and DO NOTHING, because there’s
nothing to do. The fact that work
men are needed in certain localities
and are surplus in others, has noth
ing to do with him. He is powerless.
Is it strange that suicide pacts, in
fanticide and robbery are hourly oc
currences f
“dje. 'Jeffersonian
Day by day I have seen “the man”
come home, pale, desperate, silent —
afraid, it seemed, tc meet the hope
ful gaze of wife and children ; house
rent due; food and elothing going,
going, gone; fuel exhausted, and then
—no money! No money, no work, no
food, no house —nothing but a sor
rowful wife and some timid little
children —and a pistol!
Suppose the next one in the Bread
Line is a woman! Yea, a woman,
Mr. Greene —a woman with children,
too. Can’t believe it? Let me tell
you, it’s true. For two years I have
been in the Bread Line. Not a cent
earned in two years, and not owning
a dollar’s worth of property. Try
for work? Tided everywhere. Does
not it seem strange that an intelli
gent, cultured, refined, good woman,
a trained business woman of ability
and experience, can’t get work any
where? That is strange. Why is
it so? I’w sure I cannot say, unless
it be that “the night cometh when
no man can work.” Suppose this
condition become universal. Suppose
the human race become an unemploy
ed army. A very great stretch of the
imagination is not necessary to con
ceive it.
How easy it is to bring about a
“strike” in a certain industrial de
partment, so that during the strike
thousands are out of work. Suppose
all “allied” trades, all sympa
thetic trades, in fact, all
industries, should “merge” and make
a universal strike! Mr. Greene and a
few others who own farms might not
suffer so much as some others who
own nothing, but no doubt he, too,
would soon come to know the Bread
Line in the concrete.
Yes, I have stood in the Bread Line
—and the “bread of charity is bit
ter.” Some of the millions of mon
ey spent on the foreign missions fake
would set me up in a business that
would soon be able to pay for itself,
and support me and mine; but most
people seem to forget that “whoso
giveth to the poor lendeth to the
Lord.” Maybe they think the Lord
won’t pay interest on, or will for
get what they so “lendeth,” hence
they prefer to “give” outright to the
heathen, “to be seen land heard of
men,” whether the heathen respond
or not.
Don’t harry Mr. Watson any more
on the “Foreign Mission” ground he
occupies. He at least is doing all
he can in the “home mission” field,
and besides, good common sense and
honesty o» the subject, he has the
Scripture with him also.

A WORD FOR MISTREATED
WIVES AND CHILDREN.
Dear Mr. Watson: The articles you
write in the Jeffersonian on oppres
sion are very good, but I notice you
never mention anything about the
kind of man who abuses his family,
—where the wife and children are
made mere tools for his pleasure and
profit. They must fill his pockets with
dollars by their labor, but are not al
lowed to have one cent as their own,
and yet are expected to live and re
spect him. His wife may attend
church if she chooses to go and wear
faded and worn garments, but some
times she is too proud to do so when
her neighbors know her husband is
worth thousands of dollars.
Will you not please write an arti
cle in your Jeffersonian which such
men as these may read and have their
eyes opened to this great injustice?
A Sufferer.
Ed. Note: Mr. Watson has referred
to this delicate subject often, in his
speeches and writings. Nothing is
more terribly pathetic than the lot
of some wives. They have to bear
children, too fast. That is the main
cause of their physical break-down.
They have too much drudgery im
posed upon them. They are not only
mothers, nurses, house-keepers, cooks,
chambermaids, washerwomen, milkers
and churners, but they are some
times field-hands.
And it is too often the ease that
they are not treated with as much
consideration as a prudent farmer
will bestow upon his swine and his
cattle.
CHARLIE ROSS THAXTON.
The winner of the second prize in
our last agents’ contest was a boy
twelve years old, Charlie Ross Thax
ton, of Crawfordville, Ga. He made
444 points, and if he had not been
sick for about two weeks he would
probably have carried off first hon
ors.
In thanking us for our check he
says:
Gentlemen: I come to congratulate
T. E. Cartledge on winning the first
prize, and I will send many thanks to
Mr. Watson on giving me the second.
You boys ought to have seen me jump
when I got my check. I shelled the

woods with a vim until I was taken
sick, in which time I think I lost the
first prize; but I had the fun all the
same. I love to make the other fellows
'hustle. It always tickles me to make
the boys get up before day. I haven’t
seen T. E. Cartledge’s age in print.
Will he please give us his age in the
Jeffersonian? Would like to know
whether he is a wiggle-tail or a Pop.
He doesn’t jump much like a Pop.
Vehy Respectfully,
Chas. Ross Thaxton.
