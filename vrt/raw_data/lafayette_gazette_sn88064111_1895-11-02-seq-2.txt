Our esteemed contemporary, the
Opelousas Courier, came out a
colun. n-long editorial for Judge
McEnery for governor. Bro. San
doz is evidently wasting his sweet
n- ss on the desert air.
A subscriber of the Morgan City
lndependent-I)emocrat has written
to that paper requesting that it let
its readers know where it is polit
ically. It would probably be a hard
matter to locate several newspapers
of our acquaintance.
"General" Coxey of hobo fame
is the Populist candidate for gover
nor of Ohio. From his past history
one would think that Coxey would
nake his campaign on foot; but
aot so; he is going through the
country in a Pullman palace car !
The Iberville South has entered i
..,)on its zist year. The South is
on,: of the ablest and best weeklies
in thl. State, and t is safe to say e
that as long as Calvin Schwing will'
be its editor this old I)emocratics
journal will continue in the front
ranks of Louisiana journalism. P
Dismal prophets of the Wiggins
kind are predicting a hard winter. t
They are full of science and pro- i
phetic gall. The goosebone is near- a
ly all white this year, and the result
will be that snow will be on tl-e a
ground from early in December un- I
til late in April, according to geese ci
prophets. A long, cold winter, t(
filled with blustering storms, is i
ahead. There are other signs that c;
confirm this. C:orn husks are un- a
usually thick, and chipmucks and w
woodchucks are already fat enough bH
to kill. Coal is advancing and gas
companies are threatening to raise ti
their rates. The cheek of the pro- m
phets is also much harder, and that ti
is one of the reasons why they look nl
for a hard winter.-Jennings Times. lii

the Governors of all the States has ve

TIIE POPE IN THESIIADO W
p\ T'he TLondona correspondent of
the New York Sun cables the follow-I
" i'R. ing:
I There has again been-this week
ISil one of those oflicial denials of the
alleged illness of the Pope which are
o always so promptly forthcoming
when required, and which are in
variably emphatic to the point of
fierceness. It is perfectly true, says I
the Sun reporter in Rome, that the i
-ill , Holy Father is not ill, but to assert
or suggest tiat there Is no cause for
an. "s anxiety is to carry official contradic
tion to the verge of falsehood..
. Leo XIII goes about his work pla
of cidly and serenely, as though the
ead. shadow of death did not hang over
irted him, or, perhaps because of that
fact. Each week seems to increase
the emaciation of his body, and add +
uise to the exquisite sweetness of his dis- If
hist, position. t
' Intellectually he remains a giant,
the and he takes his full share in the !
:em- direction of affairs of state.- Some- i
times he refers calmly, even cheer- n
fully, to the dark shadow against 1
the which his frail figure stands out,
it a luminously. In the Vatican garden
idge grows vigorously a grape vine which t
San- he planted with his own hand, and F
eet- in which he has always taken pa- a
Srental pride. Beginning with this
Sweek the vine was covered with
City fruit.
tten ,"Look," said the Sovereign Pon
tten tiff to his attendants, "those grapes C
t let will yield fine wine, but I shall not't(
>lit- be here to drink of it." ti
ard In the Vatican the lttle story is st
pers told daily, and there is not one man a
within the walls of the great palace, it
from Cardinal-Secretary of State C
ame down to the humblest Papal Guard, I)
rer- who does not know or believe His to
Holiness spoke of that with the gi
ory spirit of prophecy strong upon him. ]n

but POLITICAL PARSONS. W
the N. O. States. sc
The Baltimore American believes th
red and seems happy in the belief, that th
is the clergy of Maryland are on the 1
ies Republican side in the present cam
paign, as some of them have been
ill preaching political sermons. This ce
i affords the New York Sun an oppor- in
ont tunity to ventilate its opinion of d
political parsons, which it does after it
the matter following: an
ins We know the political parson al- sil
er. together too well in this town. He th
ro- is a nuisance. He cannot become fi
ar- a politician without neglecting his
Master's business. He imparts a uI:
fierce and hysterical unreason. As of
tle a rule, he is windy and virulent. it
in- He cannot understand how anybody at
ese can differ with him. He is quick cc
er, to impugn the motives of his oppo
nents. M~ost of his political haran
gues are devoted to the purpose of
iat calling everybody on the other side rep
in- a villain, and everybody on his own ba
nd who dares to disagree with him, di,
Raca, Thou Fool ! Bad temper,di
bad taste, bad judgment, and bad pr
as manners are the chief characteris- Hi
ise tics of the political parson; and in ter
ro- connection with the exhibition of co
,at these he displays a large fund of ig- tht
norance and conceit. He roars
like a bull of ]Iashan. He brays
like the wild ass in the desert, and a c
no man regardeth him.
of The active political parson re- be,
a veals in himself so much malice and
Suncharactableness, and, is so ready
i to bear false witness against his sta,
i.neighbors that he is liable to pro
duce a very bad impression upon swc
" minds not trained to nice discrimi- too
. nations. Some of the anger which
I I.is unbecoming excitement and pas
s, ion cause, may lead the thoughtless hal
to think more lightly than they sus
- should of the religion which he pro- drii
t- fesses, and of the charitable princi- c
, les which his political talk and ac- bed
e tion so often contradict. He does bed
n no good to religion and doesn't iir
prove politics or himself. dre
MAtryland deserves sincere sym- and
r pathy if it is now suffering from a pre'
d plague of political parsons. iS

70 Wf It is said that Gen. Longstreet
will soon publish a book in which
it of he will make some very adverse
)llow- criticisms on the skill of Gen. Lee
asra tactician. The renegade gen
week eral has already forfeited about all
f the the respect the people of the South
h are once had for him and if he make an
ring t
.e in. effort in the line indicated there will
nt of not a be a shred of it left. In this
says connection the Memphis Commer
it the cial-Aljpeal pertinently says: "If
ssert Gen. Lonstreet makes good his
e for I
adic- criticism he will achieve a fame
lood. greater even than thaI he won in
pla- war. Lee's campaigns have been
o the studied by the greatest military
thato critics of the world, and his fame as
rease a soldier has grown brighter year
I add by year. It is a sufficient answer
dis- for the unskilled in the art of war
nt, that Lee cutgeneraled .cry com
