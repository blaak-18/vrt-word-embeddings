To Our Patrons.
Having perfected our arrangements
for the publication of the VFitn;lalor,
upon a firm basis, we beg the public
will overlook the half sheet issued
this week. After this issue, we will
give a full paper, as in the past. In
future we will adhere to the CASH
PRINCIPLE; no Jon WORK, or SUB
SCRIPTION, will be taken except when
paid for in advance. The Vindicator
will be in its tone in the future, as in
the past, knowing no one as friends
who are enemies to the true interests
of our people, we will fearlessly ex
poge all fraud ,and corruption, no
matter from whom or what source it
eminates. Refering to our conduct
in the past, we confidently claim the
support of our people in the future.
Premiums to Subscribers.
The Vindicator will be furnished to
subscribers at the following rates.
1 year........................ $3

No subscription received for less
than six months.
ALL SUBSCRIPTIONS INVARIABLY IN
ADVANCE.
We will furnish to each yearly sub
scriber a magnificent Steel Engraving
19x24 inches. Now is the time to
subscribe-write to our Editor for
Club rates, in which we offer special
inducements.
We are in receipt of a letter from a
gontlemsan long connected with the
W. U. Telegraph Co., in relation to
building a lue through this city. We
have agitated the matter, but to a
small extent, and are highly gratified
with the result. Over thirteen hun
dred dollars being subscr'bed by our
leading business men in a few hours.
This shows how much we are in earn
est in the matter of a telegraph line ;
and we are more than satisfied that
one, when built, will meet with en
couragement. The list is still open
at this office; and the matter will be
fully explained on application to our
editor.
The Nuw BART AnBL, Capt. Dick
Si not,:reached Grand Ecore on Tues
dlay morning last. She has been re
built from stenm to stern, and has been
'tfit.ted without regard to expense.
The Bart Able is now, without doubt,
the most complete packet that was
ever in our trade, and we feel assur
ed that our public will liberally pat
ronize her. G. C. Hamilton and T.
J. Dowty, are her Clerks.
Since out last we have had "all
sorts" of weather; cold, rain, sleet
uud mud, render pedestrian exercise
anything but agreeable.
THE SEMINOLE.-L-J. C. Mitchell, the
"home man" has secured this fine
packet, to replace during high water,
tle favorite Flets, and we must say
that she, in every way, meets the
wants of our trade. Having fine pas
senger acctmodations and a carrying
capacity of 1700 to 1900 bales. Neat
and trim in appearance, she will not
fail to givq satisfaction. Itobbins,
the invincible, does he homors of the
office, while Bowland assists as second
Clerk. Remember theS emii~le leaves
Grand Ecore every Friday at 1i M.
Temperance meeting at their Hall
on St. Denis St., every Sunday at 10
o'clock A. I.
"I Am a Soldier Sir ?"
We beg to differ with our able con
tempory, the New Orleans Bulletin,
in its views with regard to the action
of Gen'l. DeTrobrianud in breaking up
unlawfully, the constitutionally or
ganized legislature of Louisiana, and
we are of the opinion that it is high
time to understand how far these sat
raps propose to "obey orders."
Every officer, ais well as man, in
the United States army, is sworn to
support and defend the Oonistitut;on, as
well as obey the "orders of superior
rank," and all orders are supposed to
be issued in defense of that Constitu
tion, and although superiors may as
sume, as in this instance, to issue or
ders in direct violation of the funda
mental law, still the officer must
obey, as the soldier would put it,
but at the same time lie is both crimi
nally and civilly responsible, not to
his superior, but to the law hle violates,
as the Supreme Court has decided.
We contend that soldiers are not to
obey orders knowsn by them to be un
lawful or unconstitutional, but have
the right and are required to refuse
obedience, and are allowed an alp
peal to the courts to sustain their ac
tion.
Let the soldier of this Republic
but once assume that hle must obey
all orders, and does so, and we at
once build up in our midst, fostered
and protected by our care, a body
ameniable to no law, owing allegi
ance to no one save the Gen. in com
mand, and a power ready at the beck
and call of a despot to overturn, not
only State governments, but the
L'nion itself.
Gen. DeTrobriand and Gen. Sheri
dan, Are guilty of a direct violation of
the Constitution of the United States,
and the law will not allow them to
shield themselves behind the orders
of President Grant as commander in
chief, or any one else. The Presi
dent is not allowed to issue orders
Inoleas rolens, and a careful study of
constitutional law by inferior officers
in the army, will save some of them
not only expense, but that everlast
ing disgrace which will attend a vio
nlator of our laws. With Grant's con
ldenmnation which is certain, comes
Sheridan and DeTrobriand's dismis
sal from the army.
The New Election.
The new election bill which the
Republicans are endeavoring to en
gineer through Congress, to retrieve
the fallen fortunes of their Radical
friends in Louisiana, Alabama, Miss
issippi and Arkansas, speaks volumes
against the de facto and that govern
mnent which Grant foisted upon us
two years ago, and maintained thus
long with the army. The 4th of Jan
nary was its last gasp, and, althoungh
we gaze still upon the semblance of
a body held up to view by the Uni
Sted States troops, it is but the corpse
of Kellogg's fraud. The unconstitu
tional act of the President upon that
day has consigned not only himself
and his party to eternal oblivion, but
it killed at one blow the very govern
i ment It sought to protect and uphold i
no such remedies as that proposed by
Butler with his "new election bill" will
suffice to give life to such acts. "Cm
sar's purple" has been stripped from
Shim, and the American people behold
in Grant and his party, the betrayers
of our liberties and the violators of
our Constitution. An election under
Sheridan, were such a thing to be at
tempted, would be a farce in which
no son of Louisiana would be guilty
of taking a part.
Let the vile crew who have out
raged public opinion, stan4 the brunot
of it alone, we do not propose to be
made a party to their acts. If we are
not allowed the legitimate fruits of
the victory we achieved at the ballot
box in 174 against 0l eouolbinations,
then we spn:n all make-sllifts, and
will stand or fall upon the justice of
our position.
: Big Invention.
Lloyd, the famous map man, who
made all the maps for General Grant
and the Union army, certificates of
which he published, has just.inuvented
a way ofgetting a relief plate from
steel so as to print Lloyd's Map of
Ameriean Continent--showing from
ocean to ocean--on one entire sheet
of bank note paper, 40x50 inches
lare, on a lightning press, and col
Iored, sized and varnished for the
wall so as to stand washing, and
mailing anywhere in the world for
25 cents, or unvarnished for 10 cents.
;This map shows the whole Un3ted
States and Territories in a group,
from surveys to 1874, with a million
places on it, sueh as towns, cities,
villages, .mountains, lakes, rivers,
streams, gold mines, railway stations,
&e, This map should he in every
house. Bend 25 cents to the Lhe'd
Map Company, Philadelphia, and you
will get a copy by return mail.
No Compromise.
We trust that no member elected
by the PEOPLE of Louisiana, will at
tend the sittings of the Rump concern
at the St. Louis Hotel. This is no
time to study individuitl wints, the
liberties of our good citizens demn,,d
that we should not yield one inch to
the infamous crew under Kellogg. It
is worse than folly to presume that
good can come from coalision with
any man in the State Ho;lse Legisla
ture, for do they not sustain the il
legal organization on the 4th of Jan
uary, and does not one of the "boast
ed independents" accept the Speaker.
ship of a house he knows to be constitu
ted without a quorumt We have said
it all along, that there was'no such
thing as an "independent position" in
Louisiana politics, nor has there been
for six years past. Our acquaintance,
which we are happy to say, is limited,
with these persons claiming to occu
py an independent position, has
forced us to the conclusion that they
are actuated solely by self interest;
there may he some little desire to
further public interest manifested by
their acts, but they simply mean to
do the most good, when they are per.
sonally the most benefited.
It is useless to, further argue that
any number of good men could shape
the action of the majority of the men
claiming seats in the "Rump" Legis
lature, and we feel that our people
are insulted by such an offer. We
have gained this victory by the popu
lar rote, and the cheatings of a Re
turning Board will not deter us from
enjoying it. Let us be united in this
matter, and Kellogg will find that al
though sustained by Grant, he lacks
a great deal of success--the respect
and will of our people to yield obedi
ence to his laws, and the support of
our position by the entire union.
First Class.
Gen. Phil. Sheridan has proven
himself the champion liar of the age,
eclipsing the N. 0. Rep'llican, the
later-Ocean, Grant and Kellogg, for
the four latter stand in the light of
the "barn burner," like tallow dips
in the noon-day son. How any man
claiming rank in the army and as
suming to be a gentleman, could give
expression to statements that a whole
city pronounce to be false in every
particular, we are at a loss to under
stand. Sheridan says, we are mur
derers and cut throats; the Clergy of
all denominations, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Cotton and Merchant's
Exchange, the Clearance House of
Bankers, the Northern merchants in
the city, and the Committee composed
of twto Republicans and one Democrat,
from the IT. 8. House of R.epesenta
tires, pronounce Gen, Sberidan's state
ment as a DowN RIGHT LIE.l
If he has one spark of respect,
which we very much doubt, he must
feel more than mean, to thus stand
convicted beforethe whole American
people-and to cap all, comes the
Foreign Ministers in the city of New
Orleans, who have telegraphed to
their respective governments that the
dispatch of this hero of the Piegan
Indian war, was unealled for and
false. So we see thit little Phil. has
not only a local reputation, but has a
world wide name in the role of a
FIRST CLASS TRUTH DISTORTER.
We hold in our hands thie evidence
of a conspiracy on the part of Boullt,
Breda, Pierson and otllers, to defeat
the will of the people of this parish,
by "doctoring" a complete set of re
tornms to be signed by E. Ezernack,
as Registrar, who it will be remem
bered, attempted to act upon the day
of election. This "doctored Return"
was not used, from the fact that the
Returning Board were good enough
villains to suit the taste of the "cabal."
Our Committees have collected evi
denoceagainst all the Radical rulers,
formerly holding sway Ilere, moon.
tain high. This marked attempt to
get up a complete set of returns bas
.d upon unknown and unlawful a.
thority, with no votes to canvas
from, was a part and parcel of Kel
logg's desire to give Us an honest
government. That may be a new
way, but it is certainly one at which
we must justly take umbrage. The
canting cry of reform comnes with bad
gtcee from men who want to "get in"
by such means as the above-and it
is strange (?) that the inatelligence and
virtue of Louisiana are so incapable (f)
of legislating for themselves that
these modern Solens (?) desire to be
their law-makers. The days of the
political supremnacy of such charao
ters as Boullt, Myers, Blunt, Breda
and Pierson are numbered, and they
will be consigned to that death from
which their is no resnrrection-eter
nal infamy.
We see the Garry Owen advertised
for the Camden trade, but hope to
see Capt. lienn in witlh a new boat
in a few days.
The Situation.
To-day Louisiana does not stan] in
the light of a State case, but by the
arbitrary and unconstitutional acts of
the Presidents, it has assumed one of
national importance, and the well
fare of our government rests in a
measure upon its solution. In the
Great North, our distressed situation
has met with a ready and emphatic
response and the Legislatures of dif
ferent States, prominent among which
are, New York, Connecticut, Penn
sylvania, Ohio,~Indiana, Missouri and
New Jersey, have taken immediate
action in the matter and we refer our
readers to tlwe dispatches for their
expressed opinions of the conduct of
Grant's government in our affairs.
It affords us much pleasure to as
sure our readers that Louisiana and
her true people have all that is legal,
right and virtuous on their side, and
we have assurance from all sources
that we have the sympathy of all
good men in the North without re
gard to political parties. At present
in their attempts to save themselves
from the storm of indignation that is
about to overtake the Republican par
ty, the leaders are beating about
in all manner of wild legislation, such
as Butler's bill for anew election, &c.
But this amounts to but little, for
the force of public opinion will not
be satisfied with such an attempt to
thwart its demands, which are at
this moment to be a quick and com
plete abandonment on the part of the
President of his policy and acts, both
uncalled for and unconstitutional, in
the matter of military interferance
with State and local affairs. Upon
the events of the next ten days hinge
tile liberties of the American people
and we look with anxiety to the con
duct of the North in this trying hour
-ourselves we are to be calm, quief
and determined.
Blunt, the would.be Senator, and
sometime President of the School
Board, and Principal of the colored
school in Natchitoches, is a curious
conglomoration of inconsistenc ie s,
and is, in his line, a jewel-a preach
er as well as a thief and liar-an ex
ponent of the doctrine of "good will
to men," he is enternally advocating
hatred and death to the whites, and
with a "voice for war" he is a most
consumate coward. For a series of
years he has lent his power over the
negrees in this section, to such men
as Boulit and Myers-and no man of
honest character or pure Irinciples
could for a moment be his friend. In
all the legislation he attempt hn e is.
but the mouth-piece of lioul t and
Myers, for Blunt hasl not ,rains
enough to be anything bey nid a
coachman. That honest and i ftelli
gent white people slhould tire bf this
state of affairs, is but Inaturtl, and
the signs of thie times indicatb tlhat
this "bottom rail" business haslabout
run its length. Many, very many
colored men, we az proud to say,
have evinced an aptitude and fitness
for liberty and sufferage, while a
majority have shown an utter disre
gard for all teachings sate the most
inflamatory. Let any each man as
Blunt bellow out war and extermina
tion to the whites, and we are sorry
to say that a majority of colored men
here are but too ready to follow out
his advice. This state of things must
no longer exist-the country wants
peace, and our prosperity demands a
rule of capability and honesty-"to
that complexion" we have come, and
all the vain rantings, of ignorant
negro Senatore () will not save
one atom of thie past brutal and ir
responsible rule. Nature has assum
ed its sway, the attempt to thwart
its inevitable rule will result in less
to no one bat those who attempt it.
A FLATTEra TOKEN OF RGARD.,
-Capt. Sinnott and his new boat will
not fail to please; and as the ladies
seem enlisted on his side, all opposi
tion mnst give in. This is how our
