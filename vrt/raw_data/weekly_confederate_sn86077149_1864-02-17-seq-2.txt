J. S. S'ttidy, Lewis Bryan, Mitchell Bu

Ntthercuti'4 Battalion, lately found as deser
ters tothe ectmy, Lavo Lejn tried and hacged
thus paying with their lives the penalty of
their .-h- cking crime. These rr.en, we believe,
were from the county of Jones. They were
poor and ignorant men ; btrt some of them had
n-ar.relatiTe?, and all nf them had frieuds.
The hearts of their kindred have teen sore
stricken by their sad and disgraceful end. Are
they only to blame ? They left the service
and assumed that of the enemy, on the plea of
some fancied wrong done by ourovernrflent in
the removal of Gal. Nethercutt's command
from the outpost service, in which they were
engaged in Jotes and Onslow Counties in to
G n. Marf l's, and the ordeiing them to Wil
mington. This slight suppled grievance, far- I
nibbed the excuse Jur their great crime. But
was thre no newspaper which, cin mating in
that section, aggravated to the'r eyes the inju
ry they complained of' Did no newspaper
take also the ground, thatadie Government had
committed towarda them a breach of laith ?
If there were, then that paper exceeded the
liberty of the press, to interfere, wan t-. nly and
injuriously, with the military movements.
That paper instigated the crime, and is re
Fponsib.e for tbj coinsMjUtnces its teaching
has produced. When any person give?eouu-
el which lead immediately to the conmiis.iun
of felony, that perj!i is an accessory before
the fact.
If these poor deluded men hare friends, or
kin : and we know Col. Nelhercutt at least to
La their friend so far as to see that they have
justice ; they ought to search, the prss and
if it be found that pernicious counsels have
led to this deplorable crime and its a'tending
ca'amity, the blood of these rr.en appeals for
justice upou ail guilty the- instigator as wel
as the actor.

The Chatham Meeting.
. Ye are sorry to be oh'.'jged to announce, that
these dangerous ar.a agitating meetings con
tinjie. There, is relief sometimes, however,
fur in the 'midst of.the mischief, the ridiculous
fs $o extensively developed as to afford food
or mirlh, rather than for wrath. The aboie
meeting is one of this number. We ee that
Mr. Thomas B. Long explained its object, and
introduced 2-lr. John II. Haughton, who
addressed the meeting with his usual force and
abil ty" fur " an half hour or more." If we
ar? not mistaken, we reco.lect to have seen
this Mr. Long at I ittsboro' in 1858, on an oc
casion 'vhen ice addressed the people of that
counfy. We think he replied, and we rejoined.
We are glad to see that he is yet alive,. though
sorry toee that he slid lives to so little pur
p se. As we remember, he was a stout, active,
lall young man just such an one.aa would
be well fitted to be cow in the field, and ad
mirably adapted to carry the flag. We "hope
that the " Mr. John II. Haughton" is not our
brother Haughton lf the bar. We hope so ;
for a ihort time since we met our brother
Haughton,-and he was a firm denouncer of
these agitations, concurred with tis entirely in
sentiment, only that he was rather' fiercer
upon the organ of these movements than fe e
cared to be. Y'et we fear this is he.- The
tiarr.c assimilates and that speech " icith hia
usual force and ability." -We veiy much fear,
and yet, we have another raj' of hope; thi
Mr. Haughton spoke for only " a half hour or
more." We never lu:tw our brother Haugh
ton to kave any doubt on this score. But this
is an inconstant world. The younger Mai ins
proclaimed himself at, one lime the son ot
Mars ; at another the son of Ytns ; and Tope
Boniface is said to have "entered upon the
Papacy tlike af ox, to have behaved in it like a
lion, and to have died in it like a deg." The more
we scytinize humaji action, the more we
become convinced of these strange inconsisten
cies that make meu to unlike themselves, tha'
to-moriow ti.ey are scarcely recognized for
what they are to-day.
But the iroceeliii(js of this meeting ore
worth attention. Among others is this resolu
tion : " That it is the least of our intention
to give aid and comfort to the enemy, and we
would here urge upon eur soldiers the duty
they have sworn to perform. Stand by your

is not Ion -j (J' M.vTf ue, and it Would be neces
sary to put him upon some emiu.nce, like the
Hickory .Mountain. Thus, then, we have it.
our sohiiejs, reminded " of their duty,-" "stand

of musketry ami the rear of artillery upon the
bayonets of the fee, while Mr.LoLg, in some
quiet valley of the county of.Chatham, a? d our
brother Haughton on the top of Hickory
Mountain, are holding tut, the one an olive
tree (for he is strong enough to carry that and
a inufkct to ) and the other an olive branch,
both v aving their precious insignia to -otne
supposed olive hojclrrs of the enemy equally
distant in TiiKlu rear : and thus t,ur solt.iers
on their side, and Mr. Long and tur brother
Haughton pa theirs, are serving the country,
as the French say, '"chacun a son gout" each
to his taste. This is the purpore of the par
ties as set forth iu the resolution word painted

and contemplation.

Fked the Soldiers. We. have seen no re
commendation, says the Fayetteville Observer,
in regard to the existing scarcity cf food in the
arrny, that strikes us more favorably than the
-following. Yet it is susceptible of one addi
tional recommendation, viz : that those who can
afford to send more than their own sons may
need, should put iu the eame box something
that those sons may give to soldiers who hav.o
no parents to cre for them, or whose parents
. may be unable to spare them anything. Think
of th grateful feelings that may be thus inspir
ed among the noble defenders of our country !
By an advertisement of Dr. Warren, f ureon
Gennral of the State, it will be seen that all
boxes delivered to him 'at Knleigh before the
1st day of every month, will on that day be
forwarded to the army free of charge. Let us
hope that so many will adopt the annexed sug
gestion of the " Soldier "jas to require Dr.
Waircnto dispatch his messenger every week
instead of every month, as no elaubt he would
rejoice to do:
Cami'Nkak Orange C. TL, Jan. 31, 1801.
To the Editor of the Bxaminer: Believing
you to be a friend to the soldier, I trust yow will
insert the following goncl suggestion in your
valuable' paper, viz: that every family send to
their soil, hu-bnnd ur father, hs tlippsisMn-nihc
f , , - j i
j a box or proviMons. The rations in the aimy
j are short, and without aid frem some tiiiartt-r,
tlte consequences are a want of food. Allow me
to -rgest. al-o, what is proper to send; that is.
what a s.,Viier mostly needs. A box should
contain bacon, (ham or side,) peas, butter, dried
fruit and syi up in quantities to suit the conveni
ence of the shipper. Many ether luxuries, under
which the home tables groan, might be packed
in. but the articles enumerated will be most use
ful to the hungry soldier. Surely every family
can do this. Such tokens of lovannd affection
tend to encourage aud sali-fy the " brave soldier
hoy,'" and lure him "on to deeds of noble dar
ing." Let all consider this suggestion and act
as their consciences may dictate." Every paper
in the South will please crpy and confer ft
favor on every . SonniEU.

The proposition to call a State Convention,
is full of evil and evil only, to the people of
this Siate,, If it is intended only as a po.iti-
cal trick to embarrass Gov. Vance and to ar
ray abortion of the party whicti placed him in
power asainst him, and thus rill the Guberna
torial, chair with a radical peace man at the
next electien, the end cannot justify the
means. A party triumph achieved through
the. bitter strife which the agitation f this
question jnust engender, will leave the victor
tth but a melancholy prospect before him.
With a wruel ami barbarous foreign toe occu
pying "our territory, plundering, pillaging, rav
ishing and murdering our mn and women ;
when all should be muted ; when every voice
and every arm should speak aud strike to
gether, what a spectacle will .North Carolina
present if this pestileut issue should be thrust
into the next canvass. Discords, divisions,
contentions, teuds, nay even bloodshed may
follow in the tram of this unadvised and dan
gerous Inovencent.
That the clamor for a Convention originates
wth a ew discontented pr fes.sionaliHjlitieal ag
itata -rs,is beyond dispute; that it isdesigned on
ly as a party manoeuvre, we may inter from
the fact that those whohgan it must know that
it takes a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to
call a Convention, and they must know furthe r
that nothing like that vote can be obtained for
any such proposition from the present Legis
lature. But if the protest against this im
putation and declare-that they lionestly desire
to call a Convention so that North Carolina
may take the management of her own affairs
into her own hands, theysimpiv publish to the
world their determination to hold an illegal
anil treasonable correspondence and negotiation
with the crrmy ; or to secede from the Con
federacy, set up for themselves, await the pro
gress of events, and at the opportune moment
sneak hack into the Confederacy or go bo iily
over to Lincoln.
Until the State dissol vesher political con
rtection with the Gmtederate Government and
resumes her sovereignty by the action of a
Convention of tile people, all her citizens are
bound by, and ail her Legislators arc sworn to
observe the Constitution and laws of the Con
federate States. That Constitution de. lares
in plain terms, that "no State shad enter uto
any treaty, aliiance or confederation" that
' no State shall, without the consent of C ti
gress, enter into any - agreement or compact
h another State or with a foreign power."
With these plain "pnjvi-inns of the Cmstitu
tiou staring them in the face, how can the few
desperate men who h;ve got up this agitation
have the effroi.-t tryto tl ny that the very first
step their Convention must take, will be to cut
loe fre,m the Confederate States! I is not
to be supposed that they want te all a Cn
vmiion lor any frivolous or insufficient curse.
They must be supposed to know that Conven
tions of the people, have been rarely called in
this State, and then only upon occasions of
gnat emergoifoy that the theory of our Gov
ernment does not contemplate the assembling
ed' such a lotiy except upon the ealm and tie-'
liberate determination of the people, and of a
v ry lartre ntajority t the people, expressed
through t' eir representatives, t a'.teror amend
their organic law, or to change or dissolve
their relations with the other States. Some
thing serious, th' re fore, must be contemplated
by the movers in this matteigf
Their allegation is, that the Confederate
Government has made no effort to negotiate a
peace, and thai North Carolina., tired -of this
bloody war, will call a Convent ion and make
peace on her own account. This is what we
must understand Irom the oft-repeated decla
rations of the orators and presses of .the peace
party, that N rth Carolina must lake the
management of . her ow n affairs into he- own
bands. Now, .we have already shown th t
so h fiir as the State remains. a niem!er of the
C 'Ufeili racy, she cannot m.iko peace on her
owti account he cannot even make .any
agreement about it, either with the authorities
at Washington or with any Noi them State,
or even with any Southern Sia'.e. The con
clusion, therefore, is irresistible, that if the
proposed Convention should assemble for the
purposes declared by its advocates, at pre's
ent, preliminary to ail ot' t r action, an onli
mttce of secession from the C n federate States
must be passed. North C iroln i woithi then
be a fiee. independent, Sovorei -.jf TSnite, unre
stiained by any prohibitions' in the Cmiti-de-ra'e
Constitution Horn making peace with
Lincoln upon any tin a s, and as soon hs Iu r
Convention saw proper to do so. .
But peace with Lincoln would be wajwith
the Confederate States; so that the Con
vention woii'd only be getting us' ont.'of the
frying-pan into the fire. It would oniy ex
change a state of war with our natural ene
mies, h r a bio-.ely strife with oiir&ivn breth
ren and c-hndrta. North Carolina with
t-eventy Regimentsall her lighting men in
tl.it armies ot the Confederate SlMrs, after
having declarci her indej endonee and 'her
abi.hy to manage her a Hairs in her own way,
and as a sample of her management having
made peace with Lincoln, woual, in our
judgrnent, occupy a very foolish and pitiable
position. Without troips, wi hont revenue,
she would have to depend upon her new ally,
Lincoln, for support and protection. Crouch
ing at the feet of this gross, vulgar and heart
less despot, she would have to beg the crumbs
from his table to sust-du life. he very
thought of such a thing is enough to sicken
tie. Yt these rtsu ts logically follow the
proposition made to call a Convention for the
put pose of entering into negotiations for
pea e. Such negotiations cannot legally be
futertaii ed until the Convention sh id first
have passed jv.i ordinance of seeesi n and
then if they are e ntered iim, and North Car
ol, i a makes peace on her own account with
Lincoln, war bet ween-her and the Confede
rate States.is for the latter nccchsaiy and in
evitable. From our Kinstoii Correspondent.

about to die the "felon's death ami fill the

that the Steamer and cargo will be "saved.

The address ef the President t ;he "Sol-
diers of the armies of the Confederate States,"
is altogether worthy of the heart of our Chief
Magistrate, and is a -fitting response to the
patriotic action of our" bra 5 defenders, who
volnntarilyre-enlisting for the war, have sig.
nailed the nations of the earth oHheir uncon
querable determination to achieve their coun
try's independence, and notified the enemy of
the irresistible temper of the men whom they
are destined to encounter. Tlte address of the
President is couched in the most eloquent terms
of praise , and will carry to the bosom of the
soldier the assurance of the national gratitude.
It is a paper to be read by all men. While
especially dedicated to the faithful men, whoso
heroic action has called it forth, it at the same
time bears words of comfbrt and encourage
ment to the loyal "hearts of the nation. All
unite ia ths adoption of its giwing testimo
nial, and all teciprocate its hopeful assurances
of success. The President is rewarded in the
soldiers' spontaneous expression of confidence
and regard, for all the abuse which malice
heaps upon him nd .although, he may not
"press the hand of each war-worn veteran," he
makes a historic recognition of their title to the
' love$ gratitude and admiration" of the nation.
Our Own Mistake.
The following "lapsus pennce" occurs in our
article on the habeas corpus of yesterday :
" When, because of the subtle evasions of the
Common Law, it was sub-equently engrafted In
the Petition of Right, after in magna cuauta, "
Men are quite frequently translated from
time into eternity but the Bold Barons of
Kuunymede, who wrested majna charta from the
hands of King, John, in, A. D. 1215, will b
asioniehed when they see our editorial, to find
that they lived in the days of Charles the
second, A. D. 1670. According to this chronol
ogy, these venerable worthies would be quite
methusalastic that is, over four huudrcd years
of age. We wonder our devil didn't bring it to
our attention, for any devil V all versed in
history, would have known bt tter than thus to
lengthen out the span of lfciinan existence.

We were pleased to sec the distinguished
rosi'ion assigned ouaueiiiose, oi rye.n; -,
on the roll of merit at the Military Institute
of Virginia, at iU late examination. The an
cient town of Fayetteville has responded no-
ly during the war to the necessities of the
country. Lier sons are gloriously associaicee
with t e first of our successes in arms.
Within our obstervtien they have achieved
high renown. Our owa comrade, Capt. Beuj.
Rcbinsoii, Ins earned a name for darmg'aud
Courageous performance of duty which will
descend to ioster:ty as part of the history ol
the Revolution. II unselfish disregard of peri',
when retiring fro A he bloody field of Williams
burg he stopped to yild support to a wounded
comrade, was a noble manifestation .of brave
and chivalrous nature. Ab"ng with the other aa
Sociaiious of that memorable attack, is the satL
fate of poor MullHiS who died during that
bleak and dreary mghjin the enemy's redoubt,
giving utterance in Ids last- moments to the
beautifully filial and patriotic, sentiment :
Tell my mother that I died as I wished to
die, the death, of a brave soldier." Lieut,
Anderson, who -was aUo of our compaluon,
bears upon his handi;fae and manly brow th
maik of his dev.-.tion. And these are but a
few of Fayettevtle's representatives on the
field. Many otlirra share with thrill the
honors of a faithful sctfr icc.
While her soldiers befoie the enemy -have
eloue their duty, her people at home have not

of generous sacrifice and service.
