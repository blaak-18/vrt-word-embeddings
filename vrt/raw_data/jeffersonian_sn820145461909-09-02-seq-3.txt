What Our Farmers A re Saying and Doing
FREIGHT RATES ON MELONS.
Mr. Watson: —How can we get at
the railroads to get them down on
rates on watermelons?
I have thought of writing you for
some time, but make such a poor out
writing till I have put it off till now.
I have been a truck farmer for
twenty years. Have paid the rail
roads untold thousands, and have got
nothing myself.
The railroad agrees to give us
rates to New York for $113.00 per
car and rate the car at 24,000, and
charge extra for all over.
Well, if you know as much about
melons as you do other things, you
well know that we can’t load a car
of melons without loading them four
tiers deep in the car, so as they will
be saleable, and a man can’t load a
car with any kind of melons without
putting in over 24,000 pounds. I had
two cars to sell on the New York mar
ket for $160.00 each. The freight on
the two cars was $284.00, and the
good man that sold them gave me
his commission, and I got $36.00.
Could we get at the Interstate
Commission some way and get them
to make four tiers a standard car,
regardless of weight, and let them
give us a standard rate on four tiers?
And, then, if the melons were
small, it would be the shipper’s loss,
and if the melons were large it would
be the railroad’s loss.
There will have to be something
done, or quit one. I am afraid that
I have taken up too much of your
time with this horrible letter.
With best wishes for you and your
great work, I am,
Ever yours,
J. C. MIMS.

Answer: The melon raisers will
have to organize, or join some Fruit
and Melon Growers’ Association, and
fight the railroads before the Inter
state Commerce Commission.
It is probable that the Commission
would act promptly.
The saw-mill men had to make a
fight before they could escape extor
tionate rates, but they eventually
won.
BREAKING AWAY.
The cotton editor of the New Or
leans Times-Democrat says:
“In my opinion the cotton crop re
ports of the Times-Democrat show a
very general change in the agricul
tural habits of the belt. Diversifica
tion is widespread. The farmers
have learned some bitter lessons and
are rapidly breaking away from the
one crop idea. Unless weather con
ditions henceforth are unusually pro
pitious a crop disaster will confront
many sections.”
ARE YOU GUILTY?
Not long since, says the Farmers’
Union News, we urged you in an arti
cle entitled “Use Precaution” not to
jump into your cotton and corn fields
with great long plows and tear up
the roots to an extent that you will
severely injure your crops. We have
been out on several farms lately, and
we found many farmers using all
kinds of turners, turning grass and
plant roots “topsy turpy” to the bare
sun. It will be better to stir the sur
face as shallow as you possibly can
to do fairly good work, and then
turn again and cultivate your crops
as they should be. Take sweeps and
cut under the grass, and then take
cultivators and harrow and drag it
to pieces, and do not try to cover the
whole mass of green material up by
means of turn plows. You will in
jure your growing crops and the
green matter turned under hot
weather will ferment and cause a
souring of your soil, which will fur
ther injure your plants, as well as
your soil, at this season of the year.
NERVOUS INFLUENCE.
The cow’s nerves have to do with
giving down her milk. The hen is
affected in the same way with regard
to laying eggs. If you move her into
new quarters she will cease laying.
Anything that disturbs a hen mili
tates against her egg-laying capacity.
Hence everything about the poultry
house should be quiet. Nothing
should occur to agitate or disturb
the laying hens. Sometimes the
power to lay seems under control of
the hen’s will. If you shut her out
from the nest she will postpone, at
least for a short time, the laying of
her accustomed egg.—lndustrious
Hen.
DUCK NOTES.
It takes about two years to fully
mature a duck, and yet the young
make most rapid growth during the
first three weeks of their existence.
This is the important part of the
market proposition, says a writer in
the Southern Ruralist.
Contrary to old ideas, swimming
water is not absolutely necessary for
ducks; in fact, the growing young
ducks will increase faster without it
if provided with plenty of good
fresh drinking water. Old breeding
ducks, however, will get more exer
cise and thus keep in better health
for the swimming process.
Let the feed for breeding ducks
during the laying season be pretty
regular with but little change, as a
sudden change is liable to interrupt
the egg yield.
Ducks thrive specially well upon
sandy soil, as it does not get so solid
from the constant tramping of their
wet feet about the water places.
Duck eggs to hatch well should
not be over a week or ten days old.
Chicken hens do not make as good
mothers for ducks as a duck, on ac
count of their foraging disposition,
which the duck does not seem able
to stand when quite young. In cases
where it is necessary to use the
chicken hen, let her be confined, giv
ing the ducklings their liberty.
The duck with good care will aver
age about three to five eggs a week
from January to July, when the aver
age season ends, but is frequently
taken up by a healthy flock in Octo
ber and a good many eggs laid.
Ducks require a lot of good bulky
food, which should consist of chop
ped green food, sometimes cooked
Jeffersonian
and mixed with wheat bran, which is
one of their best growing foo’ds. A
little second-grade flour mixed in will
help make the food stick together
and not be so crumbly.
SOME COTTON FACTS.
The crop of cotton produced dur
ing 1908 was the third largest ever
produced and fell behind the yield of
1906 by only 8,192 bales weighing 500
pounds each. In the production of
the 1908 crop Texas, of course, ranks
first, prducing 28.8 per cent, of the
total crop. Georgia was second with
14.6 per cent, of the grand total;
Mississippi third, with 12.5 per cent;
Alabama fourth, with 10.1 per cent;
South Carolina fifth, with 8.8 per
cent; Arkansas sixth, with 7.8 per
cent; Oklahoma seventh, with 5.2
per cent; North Carolina eighth, with
4.9 per cent.; Louisiana ninth, with
3.6 per cent.; Tennessee tenth, with
2.6 per cent.; and Florida eleventh,
with 0.5 per cent.
The average crop for the past few
years has been 12,608,555 bales,
hence the 1908 crop exceeded that
average by 978,751 bales. In the
writer’s opinion there has been pro
duced several crops as great as that
of 1908, but the exceptional weather
of the fall months of that year per
mitted all bolls to open and allowed
all bolls to be harvested. The terri
tory west of the Mississippi river fur
nished nearly one-half of the 1908
crop, or 45.9 per cent, which is in
deed most remarkable when one
takes into consideartion the vast
areas devastated by floods in Ar
kansas, Texas and Oklahoma during
the growing period and the wide
spread ravages of the boll weevil. —

UNCLE SAM GETTING LEFT.
Until the politician and the trusts
got hold of us we believed we were
the smartest nation on the earth, the
most progressive, the most intelligent
and the most efficient, and we had
reasons. We laid the Atlantic cable!
We did things like that as a regular
thing.
Now comes poor old Spain with
cheaper postage, a parcels post and
postal savings banks.
As the Chicago Record-Herald
says: “Parcels post and postal sav
ings banks, especially the latter, are
government facilities provided for
nearly every country in Europe, suc
cessfully managed everywhere, and
regarded as boons to the people. They
are facilities forbidden to Americans
by the leaders of our Senate, because
they would do us harm instead of
good, and because we have not suffi
cient intelligence or ability as a gov
ernment to manage them success
fully.
“We wish no particular harm to
Spain, and do not even mean to be
insulting, but if that country would
only trade off to us a few of its
grandees for a few of our native
grown Bourbons, we could afford to
give a round cash compensation to
boot. And few people would object
even to a heavy special premium for
qiiick completion of the trade.” —
