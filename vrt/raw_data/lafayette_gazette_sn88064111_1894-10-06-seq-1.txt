Five men who have grown up with f

the Hoffman cafe telling stories of sI
their adventures in the days when ki
they fought Indians and grizzlies at re
every step they advanced toward the a
Golden Gate.
"I had some pretty close calls in the bf
old days fighting Indians and bears w'
of single-handed," said Col. Burrows. of in
ape- Montana, "but once I was cornered by is]
ed. a grizzly, a centipede and a Crow In- b3
dian, and getting out of that corner I de
had the closest shave of my life, I th
guess. I was prospecting along the e
foot of the Rockies one summer away me
back in the days when all the Indians th
that were not on the warpath were do
ready to scalp any white man who fell

sic of bears around, too, and as a rule by

'"One morning I started out to follow m3
up a small ravine that I had discovered eel
the day before and along the banks of gr,
which were some scant outcroppings
of silver. I got so interested in exam
ining specimens of rock that I pushed
on, quite forgetful of time and dis
tance until a fe-eling of emptiness of
my stomach warned me that it was
noon. Then I made a note of my sur
roundings, and found that I was fully
ten miles from camp. I was on the
bank of the ravine which was more
rk than one hundred feet deep at that
to point. All around there was a sort of
stunted half-grown forest with plenty
of rocks and small caves-splendid
hiding places for bears and Indians. I
looked around very carefully and,
seeing ne sign of an enemy, I decided
to eat the cold dinner I had brought
with me before starting back to camp.
"It was a hot day, and when I had
finished my dinner I was sleepy. I
lay down in the shade of a tree to take
a short nap, knowing that I would
- wake up in less than an hour which
would give Inc plenty of time to get
to camp before dark. I took off my
coat and put it under my head, rolled fori
up the sleeves-of my flannel shirt and wh.
made myself as comfortable as possi- cloe
ble. I had been asleep probably fif- get
teen minutes when a peculiar tickling leaf
sensation on my right arm caused me clut
to awake suddenly. Fortunately for hin(
me, I did not spring up with a start. pns
"Opening my eyes, I looked first at opel
my arm where I had felt the tickling.
As I did so my heart stopped beating caul

felt a qold sweat starting out at every stoo

on the bare flesh. He was very wide jum

to feel the sharp sting of the insect,
and I was trying to nerve myself up
and let the bear finish me in short
order, rather than suffer the torture of
the slower death.
"But the bear looked me over,
pushed my arms and legs about and
licked my fact; still the centipede did
not move. The bear stood there for
several minutes, it seemed to me, but
at last appeared to make ui his mind

nan "The bear had gone less than fifty
ralo feet away when I heard the sharp
the crack of a rifle on the other side of
me, heard the hiss of a bullet as it
'ith flew over me and saw a bunch of fur

in mal had been hit just back of the left
of shoulder, but the bullet did not even
ien knock him down. With a growl of
at rage the big shaggy monster turned

hind a scrapbook, or a series of scrapbooks
save kept for d number of years, shows how
red that taste may hange, broaden and

new ideas and ressions. Coula we
till have all the scra oks of one lifetime
so extending from youth to age, we should
have a literary history of that life.
den Those scrapbooks are most interest
ing and valuable which may be classi
fled as personal; kept by some one in
ifty dividual for personal use and behoof;
which record the workings of one brain
e of and, in a way, the emotions of one
heart. These, preserved, become in
fur time histories and autobiographies.
ani- ext in interest to these ivate scrap
eft books are those which are kept for a
purpose; to collect and preserve facts
ofin regard to some event in history;
some historical charactor, as Washing
ton or Napoleon, or better yet, some
contemporary personage. From these
the biographer of the future may col
re lect his choicest material; for be it
ng known that newspapers from which
n- scrapbooks are generally made are no
led longer the "abstract and brief chroni- c
lgcles" of the time, but are extended and 1
ith even diffuse chronicles, telling all l
an there is to tell. Anyone iWho has

hot able. Out of the one hundred thou- i

S INDIAN SEAL HUNTERS.
arae With Primitive Implements They Ottea
De Better Than the White M"en.
ieth Nearly all of the crack seal hunters
hich of the Makah Indians are commonly
ares- known as Neah Bay Indians.
in The Indians go out upon the chase
nce, without guns and ammunition, relying
a of on their prowess as spearsmen for their
,an success in catching the game. The
and schooners will carry the regulation
,oks sealing flag, something new in the line
low of bunting, at the mast head. The
and flag is a square yellow and black, cut
u of diagonal, and floated beneath the Stars
we and Stripes. It is to be not less than
Lme four feet square, and is made compul
uld sory under the new regulations of the
ife. modus vivendi. The Indians will gn
est- for the voyage before the United States
asi- Indian agent at Neah Bay. They go
in- contendedly, knowing that anything
of; he does for them is for the best. One
ain third of the catch of the trip goes to
one the schooner and two-thirds to the
in hunters, and each canoe will give so
ies. many skins to pay for the provisions i
ap- they use. I
ra The Indian seal spears are curious I
cts implement of the chase. They can not I
ry; be better described to those who have I
ag- ever seen the sallnon spear than by
me saying they look just like such a
ese weapon, only built much stronger and
mol- heavier. Long fir sticks without any :
it knots are trimmed down and rounded a
ich by the Indians themselves, and forms j
no the arrow of the spear. At the lighter I
ni- or feather end the Indians fasten a very
nd flattened .and curiously cut shingle- I
all like piece of wood, which holds the
Las spear plumb in its .swift passage
nm through the air. The spear end of the d
as long arrow is branched by firmly bind- i
in ing two light but hard wood sticks to
et the longer stick at an angle that leaves I
Jh- the two ends about seven or eight
au- inches apart. One of these prongs is v
a cut about ten inches or a foot shorter fi
at than the other. and' when ready to be 1.
a thrown forth they are armed with the
e- sharp steel spearhead. If in throw
at ing the longer one misses the
Ce mark, the next may prove better and
or find a resting place in the flesh of the
in seal. The steel spears are made
id of a common file ground down and into of
shape by the Indians themselves. The la
in lmrb is made by filing out a piece after ei
in the file has been ground down to the ti
is. sharpness of a knife blade. It gets its
e, proper position by inclining the process
e, of filing so that it extends toward the
me sharp point.
p- Fastened to the dull end of the steel
se spear are a couple of pieces of elk horn
u- divided into halves and so bound to the to
re steel that a socket is left between the fa
or two, into which the end of the spear N4
:t- prong is stuck when it is to be thrown.
it The steel spear is attached to the long
me wooden handle by a string of elk sin- II
e ews about one and one-half yards long
r- and carefully wrapped in small silk
thread. As soon as a seal is struck by Gi
ig one of the spearsmen the long arrow ri,
ie comes out of the socket and the steel alL
ei barb holds firmly like a hook in a sal
)r mon's mouth. The elk sinews, how- th
e ever, form a connection with the han
d die, which in turn is attached to
)f the hunting canoe by means of a ag
n long cord, which is made too strong to d
.e be broken by a seal floundering from
e the end of it. If pains were not taken ha
y to have the barb free from the handle
e the seal in its flounderings would snap it,
o it off instantly. All the hard-wood
e prongs of the spears brought in recent- on
a; ly by the Willapa have been bitten
and scarred in dozens of places by luck
t less and frantic seals in their struggles ,,we
to get away.
One peculiarity in the construction of me
the seal spear is the manner of binding
the two hard-wood prongs into the
longer stick. This is done by wrapping fus
very light strips of bark of a species of
vegetation well known to the Indians, to
b but hard to acquire by the whites. It off.
is a very tough fiber, and the strips are
so thin that they scarcely increase the liv
visible size of the sticks around which the
they are bound. The white men fre
quently pay the Indians big prices for the
this bark, which is secured about Neah
Bay. The whole spear is painted a dull
red by the Indians in their crude way, it
and with mixtures they make them- bee
selves from the native extracts of the thi
forest. When properly fixed for
throwing the spear readily bal
ances in the hand. and Capt.
Irving says the hunters will throw it N
with accuracy a distance of six or eight pur
fathoms. In the main less distances are over
preferred by the hunters, who stand L
up in the bows of their light cedar ca- be a
noes, while the oarsmen squat rigidly to 14
in the stern and paddle along over the neci
swells as silently as if they were put
tramping barefooted on the trail of an plea
elk in the mountains. M
The hunting canoes are no less an My
object of interest than are the spears his
or the spearsmen. They look as if La
they would not live a moment in any Yes,
kind of a sea, but in the dexterous have
hands of the natives they are perfectly yes,
safe. The oarsman has his eyes about
him as well as the hunter. While one
is looking for seal the other carefully Sc
scans the sea for swells, and he seldom yon
fails to be ready for one when it comes kno
upon his frail craft. He takes the swell S
in an oblique course, never meeting it com
stem on, nor does he ever allow his boat papa
to be caught parallel with the swells in
the trough between them. Meeting
the swell obliquely, the canoe rises like TI

over swells that would capsize an ordi- da

THE USE OF SOAPS.
e flow the Skin Is Injured by the Cheaper
Kinds.
Even in perfect health, the skin may
ie he said to be one of the most sensitive
1. if the bodily tissues. and when it is
ie naturally irritable and harsh it is lia
ble to be seriously affected by the sim
ilest of external influences.
o The skin is roughly divided into two
d .ayers; the deeper one. or the true skin,
- being the vital portion. and for the
d nost part responsible for the health of
|he whole structure: while the exter
r al layer is more of the nature of horn,
d and serves as a protection for the tis
sues underneath.
The natural function of the true skin,
which is to excrete the perspiration,
!ends, in normal conditions, to lubri-t_
t 'ate this horny epidermis, as it is
a zalled, and to keep it always soft and
I somewhat moist.
f The perspiration is, in the main, com
oosed of watery and fatty sweat; and
in determining the suitability of any
le.nsing medium, it is its relation to
these, substances more than anything
else that we have to study.
Soap, as we all know, is made by the
action of alkalies, like potash and soda,
upon fats. There is generally, even in
the best of soap, a greater or less
amount of alkali above that required "
to transform the fat into soap. It is
this free alkali that becomes prejudicial
to the skin, as it not only acts as an ir
ritant, but combines with and removes
the fatty sweat. By its continued se
tion the skin is rendered harsh and dry.
We may guard against the danger
which may attend, in some cases at
least, the free use of soap in either of
two ways-by limiting ourselves to
articles made by reputable firms, or by
using a soap which has an excess of
fatty matter in its composition, likeh6
that known as "castle." .2'
Cheap soaps, while they may;
all right to the sense of sight n
are generally perfumed -highly to
