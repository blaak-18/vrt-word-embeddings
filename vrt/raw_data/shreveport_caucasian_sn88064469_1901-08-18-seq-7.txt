Shell Beach Dest royed.
New Orleans. Aug. Is.--While the
storm which has been saweping the gulf
Coast from Pensacola andi moving west
ward during the ipst two days, has
doi great damage in this city from'
high water and wind. The greatost
fears are entertained for the safety of
the people living at Port Eads, which is
at the mouth of the river and for the
ships that started for the sea just before
the storm began. The wires to Port
Eads have been prostrated since Tues
day night at 8 o'clock, but a reporter
found a man who left Port Eads early
on Wednesday. He was seen at Burns,
which is 60 miles down the river, and
the farthest point with which there is
wire communication at the present time.
This man describes the storm which
swept that section as a regular tidal
wave, similar to the one which resulted
in such awful loss last year. He said
all the people living on the east bank of
the river had moved up to the "Jump"
which is 15 miles from the month of
the river.
The house of a man named Cob
den, half a mile above the quarantine
station was swept away and the 15 mem
bers of the family, including nine chil
dren, were drowned.
The quarantine buildings were badly
damaged but no one injured.
The big tow boat Chamberlain 'Wan
driven high and dry in the marsh but
hers crew are safe.
The government boat General Reis is
believed to have been lost.
Captain O'Brien's house was swept
away but he was on the boat which
was believed to be outside.
The piledriver at Port Eads was sunk.
The steamboat Buras was driven
ashore near the lighthouse and later it
was reported that she was sunk. Her
crew was said to have been saved.
The tugboat Velasoo went down to
Pass Al'Outre, which is the eastern
mouth of the river, with two barges.
When last seen she had her decks awash
and is believed to have gone down. If
this boat and her barges have been
lost, 10 people have been drowned.
There are numerous reports of indi.
vidual casualties all along the river from
Boras down to the passes.
Up to nidnight last night everything
seemed to be safe at the Mississipoi
coast towns, Bay St. Louis, Pas Chris
tian, Biloxi, Mississippi City and Ooean
Bprings, but since then not a word has
been heard from them. All wires are
Iown but no great fear is entertained.
The only report of damages so far re
aelved are of destroyed bath houses and
uprooted tjrees.
There has been much damsa done at
Bhell Beach, a settlement on Lake
Borgne, which is southeast of this city
snd conneots with lake Pontohartrain.
All the buildings there have been swept
away and there are reports of loss of life
among the Ashermen, but the exact ex
tent of this is not known. A tidal wave
swept over the land there uas it did nine
years ago.
At West ind the lake rushed over the
settlement and destroyed nearly all the
rsideoes there.
The pavilion at Lake View was pound

LAST FROM MOBILE.

Atlanta, Aug. 16.-The tropical storm
which has been raging along the gulf
ooasa/or two days omplete!y isolated
the city of Mobile, Ala., from *the out
ride world last night. It is known that
considerable damage has been done along
the water front in Mobile, but whether
there has been loss of life or not is mere
conjecture. Nothing has been heard
from the country south of Mobile up to
the time the last wire to Mobile failed.
At 4:30 o'clock Thursday afternoon
the Western Union office was aban
doned, the water at that time being
three feet deep in the operating room.
Two hours later a communication was
had for a few minutes with Mobile.
The Associated Press operator there had
made his way to the operating room in
a boat. He took up his ¬∫witch on top
of the switchboard sevetal feet above
the flooded office and detaching the As
sociated Press wire from its place in the
board sent this message:
"Am on top of switchboard here with
a lineman. The water is over three
feet deep in this room and it is still ris
ing. The wind is blowing at the rate
of 50 miles an hour and we look for
worse tonight. The business district is
deserted - ."
Here the wire failed and nothing
could be heard from him although the
most persistent efforts were made.
The water at 8 p. m. Thursday was
reported as high as in the great flood of
1698, although at that time the wind
was not as high.

lReeIrts f:om Mississippi Sound indi
cate cronasiudrahle damage done to small
bridges, bathing piers and wharves.
Some small boats were damaged, but no
lives reported lost.
Wires running to Port Ends are still
down and communication with that sta
tion is difficult. The backing up of the
water in the river caused the overflow
of much lands lying along its banks
around and below the fort. Much of
tme rear sections of New Orleans are
under water. A number of man nfao
tories have been invaded and tempora
rily shut out of business. There is a
foot of water in many homes. Scows
were brought into requisition to enable
people to get from their homes to high
er portions of the city. A hard and
steady wind backed up Lake Pontohar
train into the old and new canals and
both of these overflow ed their banks for
a considerable distance.
Hundreds of the business men of New
Orleans live along the gulf coet during
the summer and thus far have been un
able to reach the city.
Reports from Milneburg says the big
excursion steamer New Camelle, lying
at the wharf there, was capsized and it
pounding heavily against the pier. No
report of the loss of life by her sinking
has been received. The tugboat Nep
tune is also reported capsized.
Much apprehension is felt in the oilty
of extensive damage to rice by the
storm, though the prostration of tele
graph and telephone lines makes it dif
Aicult to obtain accurate information.
Reports from the rear of the city say
an area of about two miles in extent
thickly populated is flooded to the
depth of two feet and there I. much
suffering among poorer classes in con
sequence.
Local Foreast Officer Oline gave out
the following yesterday morning:
"Hurricane signals along Louisiana
and Eastern Texas coasts Storm off
Louisiana coast undoubtedly of great
intensity, moving northwest and will
strike the coast between the month of
the Miss¬∑esippi and Galveston, causing
hurricane winds from an earterly direo
tion on the Louisiana coast and north
erly on the Texas coast."
No advices have been received from
Grand Isle and Cheniere Caminada
Many Louisiana people spending the
sammer at Grand Isle which is adja
eent to Cheniere, are reported lost.
Over 3000 lives lost at Oheanere wham
that nook of land was swept by a
storm a few years ago.
The Mlissssppi river in front of this ?

In order to avoid being swamped.
The regular westbound Texas and

the trains from this side to the other
side of the river were unable to make
their landings.

Mobile, Aug. 1L.--The average veloe
ley of the wind here since early this
morning has been 41 miles an hoar
and the greatest 50. It has rained in
cessntly since last Wednesday night.
Water in the river has been backed up
ian isup to Water street at the cross
ing of Conti. All mills north of One
Mile creek and foundries and boiler
making establishments in the southern
part of the city have been forced to shat
down. Wharves along the bay have
suffered considerably.
Reports from Coden and Portersville
ay that the shell road was overflowed
to some depth and several families were
compelled to move further into the in
terior.
The wind continued all day at an av.
erage of 40 miles an hour with frequent
puffs of 10 miles faster, shb6wing great
strength. The rig er overflowed the
cotton wharf on front and Commerce.
Highest Water Known.
Burnside, Ky., Aug. 16.-The highees
water ever known in this locality in
August is raging here. The Cumber
land river has overflowed the banks
and doing great r.amage to crops in the
bottoms It has been raining steadily
for 96 hours.

Tucson, Aug. 16.-The Santa Oras
rivar has reached the foot of Congress
street, overflowing the valley fora mile.
Severe storms have visited this territory
in the last week. A large bridge was
washed away near Fairbanks on the
Arizona and New Mexico railroad. A
body was seen floating down the river
followed by a buggy. A storm which
was almost a cyclone visired Tucson,
tearing off several roofs and dewolisn
ing the gas works. All rivers are rag.
tag torrents.
