Genial Baxter Clegg was quite
ill three days this week, but he is ti

As a matter of historical fact the
Town Council should ascertain the
height of the weeds in some parts
of the town.
After a few days pleasantly passed ti
with friends and relatives in this
town, Sam Plonsky left Wednesday a
to take charge of his office in the
New Orleans mint. I
John Buhler, once a resident of a
Lafayette, but now of Algiers, spent p
a few days with his friends in this tl
town. u
The addition to the school house t
gives a very neat appearance to the
building which is now handsome as t
well as commodious. The work r
was done under the supervision of
that skillful workman, Fred Mouton. t,
Mrs. Leonce Littell, of Opelou- v
sas, came to Lafayette Tuesday i
to attend to her sick relative, Mrs. s
Sampson, who, we are happy to say, s
is much better. s
Mr. B. A. Salles, who was pres- a
ent at the sales at Eunice, informed i
The Gazette that the prices ranged g
from $35 to $225,- amounting to c
abut $54,000 the first clay.
There were over 2ooo people on
the grounds.
The public school under the effi
cient principal. Prof. R. C. Greig, r
began the session with an enroll- 1
nent of 130 children. This large %
attendance necessitated the services f
of another teacher and Miss Lizzie
Mudd, a young lady possessing the
necessary qualifications, was en-i
gaged. 1
Rev. J. J. Hoffman, a Lutheran
missionary, called at our office
Friday morning. The reverend
gentleman had just returned from
Eunice where he had gone in the
interest of his church. He pre
tlicts a brilliant future for Eunice.
Who would have suspected that I
3L'Anse Berlucheau had a base ball 1
club? A good, well-organized I
club who will be here tomorrow to
play a game with our own Perse
4verance club. The game will take
place in the afternoon on the dia
mond, for a wager of $1o.
A company of amateurs from
Breaux Bridge, the town of thea
.tres, pretty girls, good music, and
whiskey-toddies, will play two short
.comedies at Falk's Opera House
tonight. Those who witnessed these
plays at Breaux Bridge a few days
.ago informed us that they are well
worth the price of admission.
The Gazette has received an in
vitation to attend the marriage of
Miss Blanche Lehman to Henry
Bendel, Tuesday evening, Septem
ber 25, x894, at x 17 East 64th
street, New York. Mr. Bendel
has lived here, where he is
well and favorably known; he is
now a leading merchant at Morgan
.City.
As per agreement the H-ard-to
Beats of Scott showed up Sunday
;afternoon with a fixed determination
to wipe the earth with the celebrated
Evening Stars, but owing to the wet
condition of the earth they were
-compelled to forego that pleasure.
If the weather be fair they will re
turn tomorrow when ;the question
.of championship will be definitely
settled.
Eunice, the newest of the new,
has been visited. by several of our
citizens this week. Eunice, like
'Crowley, will stand as a living mon
,ument to ithe enterprise of the
Duson brothers. It will show to
old fogies the efficacy~ of printer.s
ink judiciously used.
Our boys braved the elements
last Sunday and went to Carencro
to play a game of base ball with the
t. .off thflt town. Thle lfav-tt.
boys were far superior players and
before the game was over their op
ponents threw up the sponge. The I
score stood 17 to a. We under
stand that the Carencro boys will
practice with a view of regaining
their lost laurels. 5
Mr. and DMrs. H. VanderCruyssen
and Charles Broussard went to
Breaux Bridge Friday evening to
attend the marriage of Miss
Marcelitte Broussard and Mr. T
Oneziphore Badon. The ceremony
was performed Saturday afternoon
by the Rev. Father Borias in the t
presence of a large number of friends t
and relatives of the couple who are 4
estimable members of old and
prominent families of St. Martin.
The young men of Lafayette,
headed by that indefatigable pleas- 4
ure-seeker, Louis Lacoste, will open c
the season by a calico ball at Falk's I
on the 22d instant which promises
to be a brilliant social event whose 1
success will be the talk of the young 4
folks for many days to come. If we
may judge by the elaborate prepa
tions it will knock all former efforts
into utter insignificance.
Prof. Le Rosen opened the High
School with an attendance of sixty
ty-six pupils, thirty-three being from
the country, which is proof enough
that the High School is a parish
institution and its beneficient results
are not restricted to this town as
some people erroneously claim.
It is absolutely necessary that an
assistant to Prot. LeRosen be ap
pointed 'without delay. We hope
the school authorities will see their
way clear to immediate action in
this matter.
Everybody should bear in mind
that it is tonight that Judge Meaux's
Dramatic Club will present to the
public at the Pilette hall a very in
teresting comedy entitled "'Le Par
venu." This club is composed of
Pilette's local talent and we are as
sured its first appearance will be a
signal success. Judge Meaux has
spared no efforts to give the people
an entertaining representation and it
is to hoped that the people will
give him the support which the
cause deserves.
Mr. C. B. Porch returned Thurs
day evening from Jefferson City,
Mo., in company with his newly
made bride, Miss Louise C. \Voehr
man, an accomplished young
lady of that city. The ceremonies
which united for life our estimable
friend to the one of his choice were
performed on Sept. Ii, at noon, by
the ,Rev. Dr. Johnson,a leading inin
ister of Jefferson City. Immediate
ly after the nuptial knot was tied
the happy couple took a train and
started on their journey homeward.
They arrived here Thursday evening
and proceeded to Mrs Young's
where the sincerest good wishes of
all were extended to them.
P. M. Kokanour will accept our
t thanks for neatly printed and well
I bound catalogue containing a pre
I mium list and rules for the Annual
o Fair of the Jennings Fair and Park
- Association to be held Oct. 23, 24,
e 25, 1894. Jennings is not a large
town, but it has a reputation for pro
gress of which more pretentious
a towns would be proud. We call
the attention of the people of this
I town to this mode of building a town
it n the hope that it will strike some
e of them favorably. Says the cata
Â· logue: "No extravagant claims are
s made, but the Association has laid
1Iout and is carrying forward a plan
for the permanent improvement of
fair grounds that will be ample for
an annual exhibition, and a pleas
ant gathering of the public, where
the products of the farm, orchard,
h garden, home and shop may be ad
:1 vantagedusly exhibited, helpful
s views and experiences detailed and
s compared, and a proper amount of
a sports and amusements enjoyed.
The association was not started as
a money making project at all. No
stockholder expects to realize an in
Scome from this source. The as
d sociation was started simply to en
t courage the raising of stock, grain,
e vegetables, and domestic handi
work, and thereby add to the value
of our farms and towns."

AT ROYVILLE. 1
Happenings in the Busy and
Thrifty Town - Reported I
for the Columns of The d
Gazette. al
-It has been reported to us, that
some infernal soundrel, or scoun
drels,have rumored that "Cherokee"
was "one" of that lowest gang of ,~
men, who committed such atrocities th
on defenseless negroes, on Monday N
night the 3rd ultimo, near Brous- ar
sardville. We have but this to say: ac
The rumor circulated is a fabrica- th
tion and lie of the deepest hue, in- th
tended solely to injure the writer's w'
character and standing. It is with gi
pleasure and gratification that we
state to our friends, that on that
night and date we were in New w
Orleans. If necessary, gentlemen e]
of high standing in this parish will t
be call ed to substantiate our word. tl
Why our name was used as a mem It
ber of that gang, is a mystery we r,
cannot solve. Was it through tl
revenge? At all events, we p
again condemn their action, they tl
have certainly demonstrated cow- w
ardice nnd barbarity; and we re- a
peat today, that the treatment s,
given their merciless victims, was h
the most inhuman, barbarous and v
cruel, ever perpetrated i.na civilized ti
and enlightened community. g
-The Whistle of the cotton gin n
can be heard from all points of the (I
compass. Cotton is yiehling a fair n
crop, and notwithstanding the low se
prices, business is picking up, with tl
the farmers as active and hopeful ti
as ever, ti
A propros of the races, it is sur- o
prising how some people make it a n
practice to get "'loaded." and then n
wind up the spree with a genuine t!
turf fight. The managers of race n
courses should not allow such dis- f
graceful fistic (biting, maiming and h
gauging) encounters. It is certain- c
ly not pleasant to see a man dis- a
figured by biting and scratching, v
with his eyes like glass balls pop- E
ping from his head. Shame! f
shame!. c
Mayor Theall and wife, and Mrs. v
N. H-igginbotham contemplate leav- t
ing Sunday for Abita Spring. Ve i
feel certain their trip will be a
pleasant one in every sense of the i
word. t
-Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Roy and
family, of Broussard, were visiting
relative:; and friends Sunday.
-Pat Revillon, of Lafayette, at- t
tended the races Sunday.
-The school house recently built
in the 5th vnrdl, near Ed Comeaux's
is a neat and attractive little struc
t- ure. Too much praise cannot be
I given the gentlemen, who (work
i gratis) erected the building.
-Dr. Scranton was a recent vis
itor to Broussarlyvi~le.
--We are pleased to state that
F Blaise, Dr. Latiolais' little son, is
now better, and is on the load to full
recovery and good health.,
S --Police Juror Durke, was in
town Friday.
-Little painted planks, with in
dex point, and name of town, can
be seen at all corner roads. That
law is a good one, as strangers will
now have no difficulty whatever, in
finding their various destinations.
--Hon. Dudley Avery is a gentle
man whorn every Democrat should
admire. Mr. Avery was a Mc
Enery supporter during the last
campaign; and today he stands as
an example of the true Democracy
of that bitter political fight; such
were the men who stood by old
Mack.
--MIiss Eva Primeaux has re
r sumed her studies at Mount Car
mel Convent at Iafayette.
C --There is no question of doubt,
that the Cote-Gelee boys can hold
Stheir own with any ball club in the
d parlsh.

chandise stores, 3 drug stores, 2
physicians, 2 saloons, 3 blacksmith

One day last week a reporter B
walking along a principal street s
eyed a prominent resident indus- 9
riously engaged in cuttiing down
the high weeds that are growing
luxuriantly, undisturbed by the S
ravaging jaws of the milch cow or
the hand of the municipal street re- f,
pairer. It was a fortunate thing t(
that the gentleman was tall and P
wore a high beaver, for he himself f
would, have been completely ob
scured. The reporter looked at
him awhile and thought of what he ti
was after. Was it a rattle snake fl
that he wanted to kill, or an alliga- n
gator, or perhaps he was after a
mischievious 'possum which had t;
devastated his chicken house. The a
more he cut, the more in earnest he 0
seemed to be. He reminded one of t'
the pictures of Daniel Boone and
the other pioneers who had to cut o
their way through the thick forests b
of the primeval days. He might g
not have been engaged in a work as
necessary to the march of civiliza
tion as was that of the famous woods
man, but his savage look and the
ferocious passes he made with his a
hoe impressed one with his stern i
determination. He would stop
awhile to breathe, and again he
would resume his arduous labors.
Suddenly he posed like a setter be
fore a flock of partridges; a smile
of contentment illuminated his care- 1
worn visage; a sigh of relief broke
the silence and he yelled out: "Here
it is !" It was his bridge. The
weeds had so completely covered
it that it had been dead to the world
these past three months.
Marvelous Results.
From a le:; ter written by Rev. J. Gunder
man, of D)imnmdale, Mich., we are permit
ted to nmake this ext' act: "I have no e;csita
tion in recountnendilng l)r. King's New
Discovery, as the results were almost mar
velous in the case of my wife. WVhile I
was pastor of the Blabtist Church at Rives
Junction she was bIronuit down with
Pl'neuonia succeeding La Grippe. Ter
rible par,,xysms of cou-;'hing would last
hours with little interruption and it seemed
as if she could not survive them. A
fricad recommendo)d D)r. King's New
l)siovery; it was quick in its work and
highly satisfactory in results" 'Trial bottles

An Editor's Impressions.
J. D. Rose, a newspaperman
from Hardin, Illinois, came to this
town a few weeks ago, and through
the countesy of C. B. Porch he was
shown a portion of our country.
The following which appeared it5
the HIardin Herald are his impress
ions of this section:
From this place I took a branch
of the Southern Pacific R. R. for
Lafayette, a distance South of'
almost coo miles arriving there
about i:30 p. m. Its name is ap
propriate to the inhabitants. It
is an old French town of about
3500 population and very poorly
Ssystematized in its construction as
a town. Tl'he inhabitants are prin
cipally Creoles, with a large per
cent of negroes. They speak their
language almost exclusively, but
can speak the English language
- fluently and rank second to no oth
Ser place in their kindness and hos
pitable treatment to a stranger.
Through the courtesy of a young
drumnmer, Mr. C. B. Porch by name,
I traveling salesman for one of the
Sleading oil companies of his town,
I was treated to a most enjoyable
buggy trip over that section of the
country in company with Mir.
Porch arnd H. J. Mouton, editor
Santi proprietor of the Lafayette
Gazette, both of whom we found to
x be well informed gentlemen, and
generous to a fault. The trip en
abled me to gain somne practicable
Y knowledge by personal observation
t of, in my olpinion, one of the most
beautiful countries the sun shines
Supon. WVe left Lafayette in the
early morning, and dtrove for miles
,and miles over the smooth surface,
through the widie lanes hedgedl in by
I the southern hedge and occasiornally
I strips of the old muodock, but
strange to say we passedi but very
Sfew creditable farm residicices.
g Vc soon canme to tile historic
I little villa ge of Carencro, a very
pretty little pla'ce situiated on the
SLafaycette braRnch of the S. PI. R. R.
After si len ii ,; g a fe mo' llOtlilCLt;
Sthere, we drove to the great and
r wiIely khno \n lluron F antation,
vi2 .''r' s'u(' 'n l 5' r t 'ol mÂ·, l omic t t .'
South. It was near Breaux Bridge
n the Teche cnourtry, said to be the
wealthiest part of the State. It is
in this part at the State and along
the Teche Bayou, where the stately
oak, cypress, black and sweet gum
grow in all their magnificence and
are claimed as the primeval forests
through which the sweet-face Evan
geline wended het way in search of
her betrothed Gabriel. While so
often being reminded that we were
on the grounds once tread upon by
this charming Acadian, many,
many years ago, and the subject
of Longfellow's favorite poem, and
looking at the pine and cypress,
decorated with their flowing moss,
it called to my mind while hardly
appropriate to clime, the following
stanza:
The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
Bearded with moss and in garmets gri.en, w
indistinct in the twilight,
Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and
prophetic,
Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest
on their bosoms.
Loud from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced
bellowing ocean i
Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers
the wail ot the forests.
After passing along this country
for several miles we came to t, e
town of Arnaudville in St. Landry
parish. It was here, I saw the first
figs growing and enjoyed the privi
lege, through the courtesy of the
Rogers Bros., very wealthy mer
chants and real estate owners of -
that town, of gathering this delicious
fruit from the trees and eating to
my hearts content. Leaving this
town we set out for Lafayette and
after passing plantation after plan
tation of growing sugar cane, cotton
and corn, we arrived at the end of
our destination long after the
twilight hours had passed us, but in
ample time for me to load my
"freight" for the city of Crowley
on the eleven o'clock train after
bidding those two very estimable
gentlmen -." n' -t
