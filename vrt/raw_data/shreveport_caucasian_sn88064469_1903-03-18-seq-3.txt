ANKENY SWORN IN.
4 Number of Amendinels submiltted 'jy
Dcnlocrats Voted Doo n.
-Washington, March 1S.-No legisla
tion was tran:tacted by the senate in
open session Monday. Befoie the
doors were closed Levi Ani:cny of
Washington was sworn in. Imme
diately after the senate met in execu
tive session the order for the piesent
ation of amendments with fifteen min
ute speeches on them went into effect.
There was quite a large attendance of
senators of both political parties, all
having summoned their adherents in
-the senate to be present with the view
of making the best possthle showing in
case of division on party lines. Con
sequently the roll calls of the day we.'
Well responded to and the vote cast
was larger than had been expected.
The first vote was takon about forty
minutes after the doors we ri,- os-ed
and it came up on an amendment sug
gested by Senator Pctt:.s providi: g
that the treaty should net go into ef
fect until it should be approved by con
gress. This amendment was voted
LEVI ANKENY.
down by a large majority, all of the
Republicans and some of the Demo
crats enrolling themselves against it.
The amendmenfwas in the language
of the amendment of similar purport
which had been recommended by the
committee on foreign relations to be
made to the-Cuban reciprocity treaty.
In offering it Mr. Pettus made a brief
statement giving his reasons for the
amendment which which were found
in the fact that the provisions of the
treaty for acluisition of the canal zone
do not correspond with the provisions
of the law under which the treaty was
made. In the law the provision is
for the ownership of the zone, while
the treaty provides for a lease to be
renewed perpetually. He contended,
under the circumstances, that the
treaty was without authority and
thlerefore not binding without further
legislation. Senator Morgan offered in
turn each of the amendments-of which
he had previously given notice. The
first of these, requiring the approval
of France, pertaining to the first arti
cle and related only to the state of
Panama Railroad company. This was
voted down by a large majority, but
as no roll was called the majority
against it was not recorded. His other
amendments to the article providing
for the reversion of the railroad lands
outside the zone to Colombia and con
firming Colombia's reservation of
shares in the new Panama Canal com
pany, in accordance with the contract
of 1890 met with a like fate. Another"
provided for the submission _of the
treaty to the French government as a
party interested in the treaty.
SIX - HOURS.
Senate Was in Executive .Session Monday
That Length of Time.
Washington. March 18.-The senate
spent. six, hours in executive session
Monday in its effort to pass on the
amendments to the Panama canal
treaty in preparation for the final vote
.on the treaty. The greater part of the
day was devoted to debateon the tmat
ter of insuring American defense of
the canal, the Democrats contending
in support-.of the amendment offered
by Mr. Bacon that the United States
should be given the initiative in that
respect and the Republicans urging
the, ,interests of this country are suffi
clently safeguarded by the terms of
the treaty as it stands. A substitute
for the. provj./on of the treaty placing
the defease of the canal primarily in
thei hand of the government of Col
ombia resulted in a test vote. As a
result, of, their frequent conferences
asine Senator Gorman's assumption of
.laderphip, the Democrats cast a solid
vpte i~t support of the amendment, the
eapublicans voting as solidly against
It. The vote was 24 for the Democrats
amendment, to 46 against it.
Postponed Until April.

Memphis, March S.--The St Fran
cis levee gave away late Mondlay
afternoon at Trice's Landing. Ark .
twenty miles north of this city, anid
the waters of the Mississippi river are
rushing through a three-quarter uf, a
mile crevasse in the embankment with
a roar that can be heard for nmiihe
This is the first break that has been
made in the vicinity of Memphis.
Sunday night the water was on a
level with the crest of the levee at
Hollybush, and the present rise carriei
it over a foot higher, sweeping away
the temporary emnbankments at Trice
and tearing the levee itself from its
foundation giving a new channel for
the ilood. The break was of such
extent that the engineers realized the
hopelessness of attempting to repair
the breach, and it was abandoned after
the ends of the levee at either side
of the crevasse had been riveted with
sand sacks and stones to prevent furth
er cutting away of the embankment
In the city the situation is the worst
that has so far been reached. In both
North and South Memphis many
homes and business houses have been
flooded and families driven out. Street
car traffic has practically been sus
pended in North Memphis, one bridge
having been rendered unusafe while
others are threatened. The tracks of
the Illinois Central along Wolf river
are under water, and trains are being
run through the flooded areas until
tracks can be raised above the water.
Appeals are pouring into the city
from all directions for aid by those
who have taken refuge on high points
along' the river and who are now sur
rottnded by water. All local packets
have gone strictly into the rescue
business, but their capacity is com
pletely overtaxed and they are unable
to respond to all demands that are re
ceived.' Cargoes of refugees and their
property have been dischorged at the
wharf here and there are several 'hun
dred destitute persons in the city who
are being cared for by charity.
ANOTHER BREAK.
It Is Several Hundred Feet Wide, but
Near the Gulf.
New Orleans, March 18.-Another
ideal day enabled much work to be
done in strengthening the levees Mon
day, and the line in the city and along
the river is reported in good condi
tion. The gauge Monday night reads
19.2 feet, which is a tenth below Sun
day night, but the weather bureau says
that the rise at Memphis is yet to
come and the twenty-one foot stage
will reach here. The Bougre levee in
Concordia parish is the northern port
of the state, close to' the Texas and
Pacific tracks, is reported weak, but
General Manager Thorne is up the
road and will put an army of men
there. The first real break is reported
in the Buras district, some sixty or
seventy miles below the city. It is
said to be several hundred feet wide,
but can do no harm, as the territory is
close to the gulf, and few interests will
be damaged, as the water' will run in
to the Mexican sea.
Embtnkmnents Breaks.
Natchez, Miss., March 18.-The fif
teen-foot embankment ofthe Texas
and Pacific railroad at Bougere, thir
ty-five miles below Vidalia, broke and
a gap two miles in length was cut by
the river in a few hours. This gap
was followed by a break in the lower
Bougere levee, which lapped the rail
road embankment o nthe south end,
and the water is running into and fill
ing Bougere swamp.
- Beeretary !Shaw Spoke.
. Beaumont, March 18.-At a recep
tion given 'to Secretary of the Treas
ury Shaw by the business men of this
city, the secretary made a brief speech
in whlch he laid great stress on the
necessity for inland harbors .on the
gulf coas . He also advocated liberal
harbor al propriations and the great
necessity for a ship subsidy to build
up South American trade.
Addresses Delivered.
Lampasas, Tex., March 18.-At the
state convention of the Young Men's
Christian association Monday the
question drawn was conducted by L
E. Jones of Beaumont. George McDill
of Omaha, Neb., international railroad
secretary for the southwest spoke on
railroad work. W. J. Parker of Chi
cago, dwelt on "The Boys as a Factor
in the Forward Movement."
As to Poll Tax Fraunds.
Austin, March 18.-District Judge
Penn delivered to the grand jury a
strong charge on the imatter of poll
tax funds, it being claimed that large
blocks of receipts have been taken out
to corrupt the approaching city elec
tion.
Death of Captain Boren.
Dallas, March 18.-Captain B. N.
Boren, a leading business man here,

-trouble. He was a wholesale grocer,
an ex~fofederate soldier and Dallas'
