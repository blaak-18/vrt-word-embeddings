THE UNATTAINABLE.
The years may teach us to endure
Our own allotted dower of pain;
To find in paths that tears obscure,
Some knowledge that is sorrow’s
gain.
Yet, tho our hearts cry out to share
And stay the agonies thereof,
One grief we cannot learn to bear:
The suffering of those we love.
—Charlotte Becker, in the Cosmo
politan (June).
LECTURE BY CHINAMAN.
Witty sarcasm mingled with kind
ly comment on American ways mark
ed a lecture —the first of its kind, by
a young Chinese student at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. The speaker,
Tai Chi Francis Quo, is a Freshman
in the Wharton School, sent by his
government, and though but 19 years
old, handled his subject, “America
and China,” and his English like a
veteran.
“Your Western traditions and
manners seemed ridiculous to me
when I came to America, just as
those of my country appear to you,”
he said. “But I did not say ‘that is
nonsense! That is needless! you
should not do that.’
“Chinese students are sent to
America because it is the most demo
cratic, the most advanced, the most
just nation in the world; but I some
times wonder if it is when I think of
the Chinese exclusion act. On the
other hand America deserves credit
for its generous return of the Boxer
indemnity, which the Chinese Gov
ernment will use in the education of
Chinese students in America.
“China is quick to copy the great
ness of America, but not to become
‘Americanized,’ for America has its
vices. (Many profess Christianity who
do not practice it.
“Confucianism,” he declared, “js
sufficient" for tfi'e* Chinese people, and
while the charity and educational
work of American missionaries are
appreciated, their religion is not suffi
ciently needed as a moral force to
ever become established in China.”
, - He also pleaded for a study by
American scholars of Chinese litera
ture. “Remember,” he said, “that
China had libraries when her West
ern sisters dwelt in

AN INDIAN ROBERT EMMET.
Over in England they Saturday ar
raingned Madarial Dhinagri, a Parsee
student, who murdered Lieut.-Col.
Curson-Wyllie and Dr. Cawas Laicala.
He had shot them in revenge for al
ledged wrongs to India. Os course,
he is looked upon as a fanatic, a pa
triot whose zeal had overbalanced his
mind and one worthy of death. And
Public Opinion Throughout th r .:ion
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
it is not easy to see how he can es
cape the death penalty or how under
the laws governing Christian lands
today he could be allowed to go free.
On the face of it, he has simply
cold-bloodedly killed two of his fel
low men. That is the view the law
and the courts must deal with him on.
But listen to some of his sentences
while in the dock:
“I do not wish to say anything in
defense of myself, but simply to prove
the justice of my deed. As for my
self, I do not think that an English
law court has any authority to arrest
and detain me in prison, or to pass on
me a sentence of death. That is the
reason I have not employed counsel.
“I maintain that if it is patriotic
for Englishmen to fight against the
Germans if they occupy this country,
then ft is much more patriotic in my
case to fight against the English.
“I hold that the English people are
responsible for the murder of 80,000,-
000 of my countrymen during the last
fifty years, and that they are also re
sponsible for the taking from India
of one hundred million pounds every
year from India to this country. I
also hold that they are responsible
for the hanging and deportation of
my patriotic countrymen, who do just
what the English here are advising
their countrymen to do. If the Ger
mans have got no right to occupy
this country, then the English have
no right to occupy India, and it is
perfectly justifiable on our part to kill
any Englishman who is polluting our
sacred land.”
“I make this statement, not for the
pupose of mercy or anything of the
kind. I wish the English would sen
tence me to death, for in that case
the vengeance of my country will be
all the keener. I put forward this
statement to show the justice of my
cause to the outside world, especially
to our sympathizers in America and
Germany.”
This simple language, coming from
the abundance of his heart, has a
parallel in English history. The sen
timents and even the verbiage smack
of the famous speech from the dock
of the Irish patriot-martyr, Robert
Emmet, who more than a hundred
years ago went to his death for rais
ing his band against the might of
England’s oppressors in his country.
Emmet was no murderer, but the
same spirit that drove him to open
rebellion animates Dhinagri—love of
one’s native land.
The Parsee committed a dreadful
wrong when he killed two of his
country’s enemies, but he has sound
ed a loud alarm that foretells the
downfall of British power in India.
The wrongs inflicted on a conquered
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, July 22, 1909
race are crying out for >
and that vengeance will come. One
day India will take her place among
the independent nations of the earth
and then grateful people will raise
monuments to the memory of Mada
rial Dhinagri as one of those who
died for his country. Today he is a
murderer; then he will be a hero.
So much depends upon the time and
the point of view. Nathan Hale, the
martyr of today, was a spy in the
days of the revolution, hated and de
spised by his captors. Now his name
burns “on fame leaf and on angel
leaf.” Emmet died on the gallows a
dishonorable death; yet now his
death date is solemnly observed al
most over the world by his compa
triots and their sympathizers. Dhin
agri will probably die on the gallows,
but his name will live in the hearts
of the people of India who understand
his motives.—Augusta Herald.
UNCLE JOE.
“I guess 11l stay in the game till I
die," said Mr. Cannon when asked if
he had any intention of retiring from
politics. “My constituency is very
kind to me, and as long as they con
tinue to want me I’ll be on the job.
I can't bear the idea of giving up and
loafing around while the other fel
lows are at work having fun. I’ll
stay in till I die and then be buried
at public expense.”
Among those who called to pay
their respects was Richard Evelyn
Byrd, to whom Uncle Joe said:
“You are the Speaker of the Vir
ginia House of Delegates. Are you
a czar? If you are not, you are no
good.
“I have no idea when we will get
through with the tariff bill,” said the
Speaker. “The House passed the bill
in three weeks, but the Senate —ah,
there’s the rub. Bailey wants a vote
on the bill, but with Doliver and
Cummins shooting around there is
no telling what will happen.”
For downright rascality and im
pudent frankness, Speaker Cannon
has the other Congressmen beat a
mile.
He admits that he is a rascal,
brags about how he has prospered
by the practice of rascality and open
ly declares that he intends to keep
it up.
Aldrich, Depew, Platt, and other
Congressmen are trust tools, and the
country knows it.
But Speaker Cannon is about the
only one who openly says that the
people may be damned, so far as he
is concerned, and that he will con
tinue to dictate to the President and
to Congress.
And, strange to say, so many of
our Democratic Congressmen who
were elected by the people to enact
legislation opposite to what Speaker
Cannon wants, vote with the Cannon
crowd. —Jeffersonian.
And just to think that Southern
Democrats enabled him to continue
to hold dictatorial power. As the
brilliant editor of the Jeffersonian
said last week, the South lost her
opportunity to unhorse the New Eng
land States, which have been collect
ing tribute from the South and West
since Henry Clay saddled the protec
tive tariff on the country. The ques
tion of tariff should be settled by the
Democratic party. If protection is
right we should disband and join the
Republicans. But we say it is wrong
and should not be supported by
Democrats. —Polk Co. Record, Bar
tow, Fla.
c
“What is a Republican?” recently
inquired the Springfield Republican,
to which the Indianapolis News
makes this reply: “Why, a man that
lets Aldrich do his thinking.”
“Sometimes I am tempted to sus
pect,” said Senator Dolliver the other
day, “we are a nation of suckers.”
The fact that the high protective
tariff party is in power today justi
fies the lowan’s suspician.—The Ok
lahoman.

It is aggressive, independent, different, fas

the attention of reformers everywhere.
Its theological department is a wonder. It
pleases the progressive and offends the creed
bound. It is Watsonian in many things and
“more so.” Richard Potts, a man until lately
unknown, is the curious editor. He is a radi
cal of the radicals and strikes straight from
the shoulder.
