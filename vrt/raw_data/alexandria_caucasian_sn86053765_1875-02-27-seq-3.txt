p»r<*h from Washington :

Mr. Kidd announced that Con
gressman White, of Illinois, was on
the floor, and made a motion that
the usual courtesies be extended to
liim. Mr. White was accordingly
informed by the Speaker that lie
would be welcome to the hall a|
any time. A motion was made to
adjourn uutil 11 o'clock to-morrow.
Mr. Hammond desired an execu
tive session, but the motion being
put, was lost.
Mr. Kidd desired to know of the
Clerk relative to the committee up
pointed on protest.
The said committee was appoint
ed at the time of the adoption of
the Wheeler plan of compromise,
the adoption Swing, or rather was
to have tïvîii ji'vnupatiicd, had the
'js.-'U!promitt<fstood, by a solemn pro
tect:
•Oapt. Kidd said he thought that
it should be made known that it was
the intention, should the Wheeler
plan have been carried into etlec ,
to file the pi.«»test, and moved now
4hat the fact of the intention to
draw up such protest be made
known I» the public. The motion
was carried.
Mr. <Jones, of Lincoln, brought
forward the Bulletin and read a
special dispatch, which he appeared
uot to like. Ho professed to believe
that the Bulletin had injured the
cause by certain publications, and
fulminated for a quarter of an horn
on the subject, failing, however, to
make himself very well understood.
The Speaker read the following
»dispatch, which had just been
handed liim :
washington, p. C., Feb. 22,
11:15 A. M.—L. A. Wiltz: Remain

Mr- Bower offered the following
resolution:
Reunited , That the address of the
Southern and Southwestern Demo
cratic members of the, National
Congress, issued oil the 18th inst.,
in spirit and letter, meets with the
concurrence of this House, and has,
we feel assured, the sanction of'the
Democratic and Conservative party
-of the State of Louisiana.
The resolution was adopted.

Hall «t. 7 o'clock, und were culled to
order by Speaker Wiltz. Forty

names.
lien. Yonne wanted executive
«OHsioii; also Mr. Estilette.
Several members objected stren
uously to secret session, stating that
it was about time to do away with
this mystery. The motion for ex
ecutive Ki'Ksion was lost.
Mr. Wiltz read the following tele
gram :
Washington , Feb. 22.
To Kd. Booth and L. A.Wiltz, New Orleans:
Submitted the modification of the
Wheeler proposition, embracing
eaueua views as last expressed.
Same has been rejected. Will you
accept or reject the W heeler prôpo
sition ? No bet ter terms can he had
h "re. The President favors adjust
ment earnestly, bitf defers to the
Wheeler views. Committee teport
to-morrow adverse on every point,
except against the Returning Board.
You should act at once. If to mor
row brings any advantages, will
withhold your action and advise.
Zacharie,
Burke,
Leonard.
The question of secret or open
•ession was again raised, and " con
siderable discussion ensued. A de
«ire for closed doors appeared to
oppress several members, and a mo- v
f inn f a tlmf imo .....1
lion to that effect was made and
Hcconded. A call of the, roll dis
closed a majority in lavor of it ;
whereupon every one not a repre
flentative was requested to leave.
Tho executive session lasted
abontan hour, after which an ad
journment was taken until to -day
at 10 o'clock.
The suggestions, it is ascertained,
contained in tiie telegram of Messrs.
Zacliarie, Burke and Lenord, were
discussed at length, but nothing
«leti ni te relative to them was ar
rived at.
0 -A.dispatch to these plenipotcn
tjuries in Washington, containing
certain interrogatories, was trans
initted last night immediately after
adjournment, and until an answer
is given, nothing further will be

in a decidedly devil-way care fash

attention. " Oonie this way," said
his majesty fiercely. The officer
obeyed. " You belong to tho stupid

everything." "Indeed! Then how
many nails are there in this bridge?"
" Seventeen billions, ono hundred
and eighty four millions, three hun
dred and fifty-eight thousand, nine

[From the N. Y. Tribune.J
Tin: proof accumulate that nil
energies of the party in power uro
bo heut in one direction for the Presi
dential campaign of which, ac
cording to Senator Conk ling, was open
eil with the Louisiana debate in the
Semite. Everything points to a con
centration of force upon the programme
indicated by The Tribune a few days
since. The passions of the war are to
be rekindled, sectional animosity re
vived, nnd a Presidential campaign
made upon appeals to prejudice ainl
arguments addressed, not to reason,
but to passion. Indeed, what else re
mains ? The campaign approaches
and the party must enter upon it with
weapons of some sort, with some kind
of political issue. There is no other
resource. That, they cannot carry tin*
country again upon the brilliant record
of the party from IHtiO to Itfti.i is mani
fest to the most- careless observer. Too
much has happened since then for
which the party is responsible to which
it cannot " point with " pride." To
go to the country upon the recoul it
has made in the management of the
finances of the country would be fatal.
A prostrafe commerce and crippled
business, continued financial depres
sion and distress, tin unsullied curren
cy and the hopeless divisions in the
party upon questions pertaining there
to, all forbid any demonstration m that
direction.
I*.«!ualiy weak would be any appeal
to the people to sustain the party upon
the merits of its reconstruction policy.
The fact that only in the reconsti u ted
States which have thrown oil'the yoke,
of the Administration is there anything
like prosperity, or peace—the others
being plundered like South Carolina or
kept in disorder like Louisiana—would
be conclusive against them. The re
sults ol two years of investigation for
bid their making any claim upon . the
score of honesty ; the condition of the
Treasury answers abruptly their pro
fessions of retrenchment, and the con
dition of the public service, the charac
ter of a large proportion of the men in
office, the record or the President liim
self, and the Hagranj» dishonesty of
their repeated protestations in favor oi
Civil Service Reform all stand con
spicuously in the way of any further
attempt to use that much abused pre
tense in another campaign. For the
rest, it remains only to reiterate the
claim that it is a party id' moral ideas
that it contains the most of the intel
ligence, honesty and patriotism in the
country, and that the country can bet
ter afford to trust it, with all its crimes!
and follies, than to risk the ascendency
of the Democracy. There is some, truiii
n this, but what, a procession of facts!
and circumstances, of broken promises,
short-sighted polices, and repudiated
leaders would rise up against the as
sertion of the claim. Ruth

the Senate, and both repudiated by the
people after the party had indorsed
them ; the fading line of statesmen.

against such an a'rray who could have
the assurance to ask the perpetuation
in power of a party of such moral
ideas ?
I
No. There is nothing left the lead
er» of the Administration party but
this last desperate resource. Failing
to find anything in their recent, record
upon which they could go to the coun
try as successful administrators or
wise legislators, tjiey have jumped the
whole, and set ttjflkhcnisc.lves the tain
of convincing tlié people that the same
condition exists now which at the close;
of the war made their political ascend
ency essential to the final success of the
principles for which the war was
fought, and to the prosperity and peace
of the country. 7lie people are to be!
made to believe that the spirit, of re
sistance to the Federal (government is'
as life as ever in tlio Southern States,)
and no less dang-rous ; that the dispo
sition of the white citizens is brutal!
and inurdeious ; that no Northern mau
is safe in the expression ol his opinions

have been set free and clothed with

This it is that here anil now upon
the very threshold of the whole I nul
business we denounce as a crime
against the party whose early knightly
record it sullies, against the country
whose peace it aims to destroy, and
against humanity which it sins against
and shames. It may sfiein easy to
arouse the slumbering passions of a
people just, resting in the conscious
ness of triumph by the false alarm that
the prostrate enemy seeks to renew
the fight, and reverse the event. It
easier, no doubt, than to meet the peo
ple upon the record of this Adminis
tration. Rut success waits on neither
plan. How much mischief they may
do in the next two years Heaven only
knows. It' they carry out the pro
gramme foreshadowed by the Presi
dent, iu his Askatisas message, and
undertake the revolution to which his
language clearly points, we may count
upon two years of turbulence and dis
order worse if possible than open war.
Hut the end will come, and the people

goes out of office what he said when he
came in, " Let us have " peace."

3 ar/l the Siblo from a Critiqua
on Dr. Draper's Bosk.
But in the view of this scientist,
greatness and value are measured
only bv extent of space. Mind and
a moral nature are little. Matter is
all. Some men think, and I am of
the number, that one intelligent soul,
a being possessing a moral nature, is
woilii more than a whole system of
gaseous matter ; and think that the
iiome of such a soul, though it be a
mere speck in the infinite void, is of
proi'oiitider interest than a nebulous
it makes a sphere
josh diameter is great as the obit
of Neptune. Dr. Draper d.flora from
us. To him, gas, if it be extended
and far enough ofl, is more import
ant than a world of thing eouls. lint,
I will not pursue a subject which is
painful and exceedingly distasteful
to one who has a sincere admiration
and nrt'ecîion for the writer wnose
book ho criticises. This letter lias
been written not as a detailed re
view of " The Conflict between
Science and Religion," but rather to
indicate this conclu ion : The time
has no} come when we can conti
dently lay aside what we have been
so long thinking was God's revela
tiou, and in its place adopt the con
clu aon of scientists who reject and
hold it in contempt. When I think
of the " discoveries " that are redis
covered aud lost again, the " con
clusions " thai are made and re
modeled, the "theories" that arc
established nnd renewed, the 4 'Jaws"
that are fixed and reconstructed, the
" species " that are created and van
ish every year under the hand of
these gentlemen, it does not seem to
me extremely dangerous to wait
awhile and to hold fast to the old
Book, with its method of pardon
which we need and the comfort and
peace which it somehow gives to so
many people. The Bible—and this
one cannot but belive that even Dr.
Draper will acknowledge—has ever
more been the friend and helper of
science. The hour when it was given
to the people nnd began to throw its
radiance over Europe was the hour
H'ltou science w deed to a new life.
The lands where it is freest, where
it is most read, are tho lands where
the scientist lias his most favored
home. Whether he acknowledges it
or not, he sits under its shadow with
great delight. Whilo this book of
Dr. Draper's will take its place among
the multitude of like attempt to
impugn the Bible ns a revelation
from God, nnd with them will grow
silent, the fact will still be none the
less true, (hat for a man of science
to attack tho Bible is to do an un
grateful and an ungracious thing.
Meanwhile when Dr. Draper tells us
approvingly that the decision of
critics is " that Genesis is a narrative
based upon legends; that Exodus is
not historically true ; that the whole
Pentatehch is nnhistoric and non
Mosaic ; it contains the most extra
ordinary coetradictions nnd impos
sibilities sufficient to involve the
credibility of the whole,*' it is inter
esting at least to know that these
very books nre just now studied more
careful I v and systematically aud by
manifold more minds than éver be
fore since they were written ; that.
Sabbath by Sabbath over a large
portion of tho Christian world the
eyes of young.and old are bent upon
them, and that somehow they seem
more real nnd valuable than ever
before. He who believes tho Bible
can afford to bo satisfied with the
present position of things, and can,
I think, feel at case. When this
class of scientists, who talk so loftily
and with such confident assertion,
come to somejtolerable sort of agree
ment among themselves as to their
facts, wo may attempt to adapt our
interpretation of the record to them.
No one needs fear the result when
that time comes. Believers in the
lîiblo can say to the men of science,
with a propriety emphasized by all
its past history. " You have enlarg
ed the domain of thought ; you have
given us new nnd glorious views of
the ci cation of God ; j'onr telescope
and your microscope have opened
hefoie us visions of tho greatness of
(rod which fill us with adoring won
der ; wo Welcome, we glory in your
investigations, wo stand side by side
with you in your researches and
your questionings of nature nnd the
past ; we puisne thein with tho nr
dor and enthusiasm that inspire you;
we will not permit you to tnrust us
away from you, we have helped yon
in the past, we are suro that wo can
help you iu tho future ; but let us
not be hasty in onr conclusions or
too confident in our assertions. The
domain of naturo is very largo ; we
are not very great nor very wise.
Nature is very old, wo are of yester
day and know nothing. Facts are
not easily reached in flic great un
known." Ihe Bible is a very pro
found hook. As Robinson said—
and 250 years have all the while
been confirming it—"New light is
evermore breaking forth from the
Word of God." We have often
been compelled to correct our in
terpretations of it. We shall prob
ably have to do so again. In our
explanations both of nature and of
the Word, modesty becomes us
both. Wm. Aikman , D. D.
