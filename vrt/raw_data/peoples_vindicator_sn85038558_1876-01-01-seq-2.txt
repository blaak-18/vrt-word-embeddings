Our Home Minstrels
Gave their first cºrand entpr
taimment on last Monday night'
to a crowded house.
The music and acting would
have done credit to any profes
sional troupe, all of which was
duly appreciated by the audience,
for they were roaring with laugh
ter during most of the time.
Bones and Tamborine, acted so
well their parts that it could be
said of them, "none could have
done better." The "Dutch song
and dance," was inimitable, and
brought the house down in roars
of laughter. He was eneored twice,
when he asked for breathing time.
We can only say in conclusion,
that we hope they-may be induc
ed to repeati, n a bkort while,
their very a'ng atr t profitable

A singlar mif tarnf has been
noticed in Cane river opposite this
city and that it has been flowing up
stream for some days, and what is
most singnlar is the rapid rise from
below. It is accounted for from the
heavy rains beTow filling up Kisatchie
and the lower river so rapidly that
the water could not run out. With a
good upper rise we look for boats
with as in a week or so.
Governor MeEnery in that manly
op to Seugtoi McMillan has

SlI ever he is true to his trust
and in ends to die at his post. Well
done, noble governor, we hope Louis
iana's sons have in store for you a
suitable reward.
The Protestant Episcapal Sabbath,

wish it all the success it deserves.

Conslstancy.
The Republican of 25th inst., takes
tor. us to task on the score of consistency,
with regard to certain remarks in our
issue of December Ilth, in which we
foretold the defeat of the Texas Pa
cihic Railroad bill ink Congress, by the
Demnocratic House.
It has been our proudl fate to have
always appeared in the inconsistent
role, to the conductors of that sheet,
25 known to our good people as the de
ii "0 fender of the hirelings, at their ex
0 o0 pense. Even while engaged in that
i glorious work of 1871, in ferretting
41'0 out the plunderers, and boldly nam
lo ing them and their crimes, this jour
r o nal (?) then stood ready with the same
ibse. charge it now makes against us.
- Happily, however, the people who be.
blieve its wild vagaries are but few,
maid and that few, of the same class as
itself. We deo not intend this article
- 1as 1 reply to it, for we have long
es a since plomfnised ourselves to have
nothing more to do with such a con
,or cern, but simply to prove up our re
ise- cord, as they say, upon the railroad
question, anil not only that, but upon
all other questions of public improve
on meats, when they are attempted with
.00 public money held in trust for the
people. This record is sound Demo
cratic ldoctrinh, and has been for all
time, since the birth of that grand
ni'* party.
ork. Congress has no right to vote peo
pie's money, people's land, people's
1 bonds, or peoples credit, for any
species of public improvement; for
P" the reason that they are suimply held
Or by Congress as a sacred trust, and
for specific purposes. Those purpo
ses are plain; for the support of the
general Government, the protection
of the citizens of the States, at home
and abroad, the enforcement of the
general laws, and, in fact, to carry on
the plan which our forefaithers laid
t down for our guidance. This wild
outlay of monies for other than le
gitimate purposes, has gone on under
the sway of the radical party only,
against the protest of every Demo
crat in Congress at the time. How
ad- can it be expected that they should
now vote for the very thing they
fought so persistently against but a
year agot We know it will be said,
ew it is but simple justice to the South,
ity that this railroad bill should have
been passed. We feel that as well as
ey, any one-we know that the North
has enjoyed all benefits from the Na
ec- tional government, but we feel more
ted pride in our not having done so, than
he they can with all their boasted im
nd provements. Men may say this is not
ats modern materialism, it is all gush.
Well and good, but at the same time
we ask of our people to let the fu
tore decide. Ours is the portion of
. the Union to which I4 immigration is i
ht bound to flock. We will build up ,
mannfactories of all descriptions, will
ld require nothing from abroad, nothing 1
from the North, in fact we will be
come producers; will have all to sell d
· and nothing to buy, and while this
e, vast wealth from our cotton, raw and ,
h- manufactured, from our tobacco, from
S our sugar, molasses, rice, corn, tropi- r
so cal and other fruits, from our horses, c
be mules and cattle, from our wines and t1
ye liquors, is flowing in upon us in one n
og unstinted stream. We will build a
ad with it our own railroads, our own y
canals. This is why we do not think n
so hardly of this action of Congress. ri
S Now about our favoring the Rail- n
Le. road tax for stock in the New Or- b
n, leans Pacific road. We are prepared h
ic- to answer that with calm, sound rea- .t
le, son, and have but to state, to con
le vinse any sane person, that the very
blessings, the very wealth we have
just pictured, are part and parcel of
en this very enterprise-this New Or. li
ui leans Pacific road. With this comes t
mP that immigration, the first step to oar b
il prosperity. It opens up Red River ti
m and its valley to the hardy farmer of
e thIe frozen North; to the sturdy plod.
e ding European-and with that our um
stland owners are at a bouna from Y
apoverty to opalence.
This parish matter we favor, and th
ta will work for. We consider it the
finest investment the property own.
era will ever make, and that it will ed
ly be their salvation. We only desire
s this question to be put to them fairly,
., and if they decide not to invest indtle
benefit, then we have no more to say.
at Let them decide, and with their de. Ca
fl cision we will rest satisfied. sa

The New Year.
alkes The old year is dead--1876 now
flCy, frowns upon us, that year so preg
nour nant with good or' evil to the Ameri
I we can Republic.
Pa- When we look back over the past
the eight years and think, calmly as we
may, over what we have passed
have through, it is truly sufficient to make
,tent one shudder. What have we not snf
iect, fered ? What indignities have not
de- been heaped upon nus Are questions
ex- more easily answered than to enume
that rate what we hare borne.
,ting Nevertheless, we should be thank
am- ful in a great measure that, notwith
cur- standing these outrages, these horrors
ame have been so great, it is no worse*
us. They have left us life, and what is
be. more, a spirit of determination to sBaf
few, fer these ills no longer.
I a" As we said in the beginning of this
ticle article, that 1876 was pregnant with
long good or evil for our Republic, it
lave should be our patriotic pride and duty
Cou- to so guide and shape events as to
re- bring forth from them all that will
'odl tend to redeem our country and its
poln citizens. Congress is now in session, I
we- and for the first time in sixteen long
with years, the South will have a just hear
the ing in the councils of our Capital.
m1DO- Partisan zeal and the old war cry, it
r all is true, has been opened against us by
and that wreck of departed fanaticism,
Morton ; but we still hope that the I
peo genius of civilization will frown down
le's the attempt of such men to keep long- I
any er alive the smoldering fires of sec- I
for tional hate. Grant has issued a mes I
Ield sage well calculated to provoke con- 1
and flict between the citizens of the Union
rpo- he presides over and should guard
the and protect, still we have too much
tion confidence in the calm repub
ime lican education of America's chil
the dren to look for a wild religious war.
on We have that faith in them that
laid tells us, the man who would attempt
wild to bring about such a dire calamity
a e- in this age, will himself be the suf
ader ferer.
ply, Of our own home measures, both
So- State and parochial, we have much
low more apprehension. The morals of
mld the country are not what most men 1
hey would desire, and riches, no matter
ut a how acquired, seems the goal of all
aid, those who go in for a political life.
ith, If we could we would keep all bitter
ave ness from the campaign about to open;
as but that, we fear, is out of the ques
frth tion. It has become a settled pur- c
Na- pose amonlg our people to throw over- t
ore board this corrupt usurpation under a
Ian which we have long suffered. We I
1m- have nothing to fear from those known t
not open enemies who are arrayed in t
ise. warfare against us, but some profes- B
ime sing friends may assume the traitor's
garb, attempt to cr te division *
I of ampng qs and thus defeat our pur
a is po0p.. Th.,, are the 1 n we fear, e
uP and to check them therm is but one
ilway. A bold determine4 front must a
ing be presented to all classes and the i
he- people must choose those whomn they ti
mel desire to represent them. tl
his The year of our Lord, 1876, thus
od opens before us. The objects to be
Om gained within that time stand out in
Pi- rugged relief in the future. Will not
s our sufferings in tile past, keep warm d
ld that detqermoination to be free, that f
me now actuates most of us t We trust o;
ild so. We feel that Louisiana's sons are el
an yet heroes and that as dark as the
uk new year now seems, the refulgent
55. rays of thie sun of 1877 will beam
il- upon us a free and happy people. We h
r- beg in advance, to wish all our friends 4
ed health, happiness and prosperity for
a- theyear 1876.
~r Key Note, it
of Mayor Leeds, of New Orleans, in
)hris late Message to the City Adminis
trators of that metropolis, sounds a
r blast which is apt to make some par- A
Sties quake. He advocates that no
tax is to be levied for the support of
schools or the Metropolitan Police,
ur until they be placed in charge of those
Dm who pay the taxes; also that no inter- 2
eat tax be levied to pay interest upon
Sthe old city debt, as it is impossible
n for the property to meet it, if asses
ill ed. P
re We are sorry to see, however, thatE
our friend, the Balletin, comes out
1E with an argument against the practi
e- cability of inforcing Mayor Leeds'
suggestions, by reason of "radical
law," which it is claimed by the Bul
letin, rather tamely, we admit, will
le be enforced to make tFe city authori- Si,
Sties levy and collect these taxes.
8* This is the issne, and should now
It- be met fairly and squarely; if Kel- At
t, logg can be made a Governor of De

Id let him collect his taxes in the same V

Speople have got tired of this cant of h
a law and courts; they are only formed
h in our State to impose upon the peo
pie, and the sooner we bring the it
d great power, the tax-paying eitizen, gl

Louisiana's Last Hope.
w Upon Monday next will assemble
-g. in regular session, that body known
ri- to the worhl as the "Wheeler adjust
ed Legislature." An adjustment
Lst which we did not, as a journalist, fa
ive vor, but when effected, we did all in
ed our humblre power to make a success.
ke We are prone toadmit, that that look
If- ed for success, those greatly wished
ot for goods that were to accrue to us,
as have not been realized. On the con
e- trary, our poor parish has drifted
back to the control of the same vii
k- lains who have brought upon us all
Ic. our troubles.
irs It is useless now to speak of these
me- matters, they are of tile past and we
is must look to the future for success,
if- and that success hinges in a great
neasur, upon the action of the Low
lis r House of the Louisiana Legiela
th ture, which will assemble upon Mon
it day next. That those members who
ty represent the white people of the
to State, are imbued with stern and un
ill flinching patriotism is our great hope.
ts We have that confidence now as ever
n, in them. They have stern work to
eg do, and to do it requires stern un
r. yielding, united effort.
I. The great charter of civil liberty;
it that liberty which Americans fought
,y and died for, the right of representa
n, tion when taxed, has been denied the
ie great mass of our people for seven
nJ years past. The privilege of the
:. right of ballot has been overcome by
.- a system of fraud, palpable and out
g rageous, and no hope for the future
. remains for us, with such a law as
in that Election and Returning board
d act upon our statute books. We will
l hbe cheated in 1876, as we were in
. 1872 and 1874, and as we firmly be
Slieve, we have been cheated all along.
r. We have no faith in radical promis
t es of reform, and those who have,
wt will be greatly mistaken. They will
ty go on as ever, plundering, swindling,
f" cheating and outraging the whites
until stern justice metes out their re
ward.
lhr Now are our legislators equal to the
Df task they have before them, and must
n be done, or in the "adjustment" have
we surrendered honor for naught?
11 The people's representatives must de
. mand the repeal of all those obnox
. ious laws that tend to deprive them
of their rights and their liberties, from
these radical Senators and this radi
cal Governor, and if it is not done,
the purse must be closed and the
;r sword drawn. That is what the peo-I
e ple demand; nothing less will satisfy
n them, and the man who represents 1
them, that proves recreant, will re
gret the act. We hope for tihe best,
$ but cannot yet be too sunguine of I
success. We aire in a truly distress
. ing condition; a condition that should t
call into play all our, wisdom and pa
e triotism---et our legislators be firmn
and unyielding in t.heir demands, and
Sif they are not accededl to, then let a
themn do their duty to the people, and
they will meet a hearty support. a
