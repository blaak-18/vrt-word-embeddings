FORGETTING.
When lips are dumb with pain too
long unspoken,
And eyes are blind for need of kind
tears’ wetting,
When hearts for voiceless grief’s sake
still are broken,
'Can this, ah Christ, be called for
getting ?
To catch, far off, Joy’s face on others
smiling,
To watch the clasp of hands when
ours are sundered;
The far off phantom of a dream be
guiling,
The march of happy feet where ours
have blundered-; —
To grasp the hand of Pride when
[Hope’s has failed us,
To watch far off at sea, love’s
signals failing;
To miss the ship that in the darkness
hailed us,
And still face fate, dumb-lipped,
without upbraiding;—
To sit, soul-silenced, by the dream
that perished,
The light laugh of the lip the spirit
fretting,
And watch Time’s changes in the face
we cherished,
And still keep silence; but is this
forgetting?
Nay, silent lips, their anguish never
speaking,
Close, like the tomb, upon the holier
sorrow;
The pain that rails not shrouds the
heavier breaking
Os hearts whose anguish knows no
glad tomorrow.
—Will Allen Dromgoole, in Nashville
Banner.
GLIMPSES FROM A MEXICAN
HACK.
We have just returned from a six
days’ trip into Old Mexico in a Mexi
can hack, averaging over 45 miles
per day.
We left Matamoras at 8:30 a. m.,
direct south for the old town of San
Fernando, on the Conehos or Presos
river, following an abandoned rail
road bed for fifteen miles, then near
the government telegraph line until
the town was reached, passing over
the richest land we ever saw, until
within five or six miles of the town.
The houses, if they could be called
houses, are from three to twenty-four
miles apart, generally about nine
miles; country quite level, about half
prairie. We saw fine cattle, equal to
o,urs, in fair condition to fat, also
Urge herds of mules and horses, much
better than we expected and yet there
had been no rain for over three
months. The timber was mesquite,
ebony and barata, with chaparral
brush and cactus, and if water could
be had it would be as productive as
any on earth.
The people are miserably poor,
managers getting ten dollars per
month and their meat, with all the
maize, as they call corn, they want.
“Ranch men,” or “cow-boys” get
four to five dollars per month and two
pecks of corn per week. I saw an old
man who got only one dollar and
twenty-five cents per month and his
find. Yet he appeared to be quite
active. I asked them how they got
Iteffcrsonlan
along on such wages. They said they
were always in debt, and invariably
wished the Americans would buy up
the land, and give them work.
From San Fernando we went across
the country due east for twenty miles,
fifteen of which was over hills. Here
we struck the river again, only about
thirty feet wide and an average of
say three feet deep, running through
bankroat least fifty feet high, no cur
rent at all; full of fish, and the land
very rich soil from six to twenty feet
thick. They say they raise fair crops
(only corn) without irrigation; in
fact, they have to, because there is no
water to irrigate with. Hence we
reluctantly turned the proposition to
buy down. They priced us the land at
$2 per acre —gold—on terms.
We saw plenty of deer—abundance
of turkeys, quail, doves, parrots, and
a few rattle snakes for those that like
them. The Mexicans do not hunt, am
munition is too high, they can’t
afford to.
San Fernando stands on a bluff
about 200 feet high. It was founded
in 1549. The old houses were very
massive, but are now in ruins. There
are many houses over 200 years old
in good preservation. It is a town
of say 2,500. (They claim 4,000.)
We were a show to the inhabitants.
The children generally fled when they
saw us.
The people were very kind and hos
pitable and did all they could to
serve us, and are anxious for Ameri
cans to come to their country. All
the young people can read and write,
but I saw no books. Every
“ranchero” has its shrine, and the
priest generally visits them once a
month.
They are a good people —a few very
rich and the others practically
paupers.
We are making progress that way
ourselves.

FROM AN ADMIRER OF NAPO
LEON.
Fort Lincoln, N. D., March 11, 1909,
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: Have just finished reading
your admirable sketch of the Emperor
Napoleon and must ask you to pardon
my intrusion upon your time in order
to express to you my thanks and ap
preciation of the work, which I have
enjoyed exceedingly.
Like most young officers of our
army I am an ardent admirer of
Napoleon and so appreciative a sketch
of his career as yours finds a most
sympathetic and approving reader in
one who believes as I do that the
further we get from his times the
grander and more inspiring his won
derful life and exploits appear.
With kindest regards, I have the
honor to be, sir,
Very respectfully,
0. W. Elliott.
2d Lieut., 6th U. 8. Infantry.
