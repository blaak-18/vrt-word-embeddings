We had th pleasure nfmwtlng Mm.
and if we had been the Gov. of S. C.

of Goldsboro, Mr. O. H. Allen, of

Clear Run is on a boom. The

smile over her prosperity, and well
may he be prowl, Tor she has Jast
sprung from the depths of almost
untimely ruin. Mr. A.J. John
son has opened a stock of goods
at Clear Run again. He occupies his
old stand. We welcome him back
again to help build up our little
town. Mr.N.R. Johnson his former
clerk is with him again. Miss
Agnes Robinson's school closed at
the Clear Run Academy on the 24th

pated a very pleasant time the follow

the unwelcome rain prevented it.
Mrs. Sarah J. Marshall of Pender
county, is visiting relatives in Samp

spending some time with her sister,
Mrs. J. P. Parker, at Harrell's
Store. Constant letters from
some of the R. R. men, (post
marked at Washington) keep some
of the young people of our neighbor
hood constantly expecting some wed

be they think Bahamas are too near
gone this season. We should think
that a railway postal clerk would
not consider the potatoes when he
lives in Washingtonbut we expect
to get that cake yet.

It is now s.iid that little Phil

Charges having been repeatedly
make in a number of republican
papers, that the Commissioner of
Pensions had given the soldiers of
democratic States au advantage over
thosa of republican states in the
amount of pensions allowed them, a
table has been prepared at the
Pension Office, which effectually
disproves the silly charge.
Another bad break is to b? charged
up to the republican leaders of the
House. They see it now, but it is
too late to stop the deluge. They
proposed and passed a resolution to
Invest Urate t hejSoveroment Pri nt
ing," cr rather to investigate Mr.
Benedict, the first democratic Public
Printer, promising to show up many
startling things. The proposition
was readily agreed to by the demo
crats, after an amendment was added
providing that the investigation
should include the four years tt im
of Mr. Benedict's republican pre
decessor. The committee appointed
under this resolution, has already
begun work, and enough has been
done to make the republican very
sorry that they started it, and the
indications are that their sorrow
will continue to increase. - Here are
some figures taken from the boks
cf the Government Printing Office,
that speak volumes: I Jan. 18S6
under Rounds there were 2,352 per
sones on the rolls receiving $163,820,
and in Jan. 1883, under Benedict,
there are ?,41 on the rolls receiving
?ioi,io. jsorwunstanding the great
reduction in the number of employes
over 300 and the large saving in!
cash over $15,000 in a month, there
was more work turned out of the
office in Jan. 1888 than in Jan. 18S6.
