A STORY.
A subscriber once got a dun through
the. postoffice, and it made him mad. He
went to see the editor about it, and the
editor showed him a few duns of his
own-one for paper. one for type, one
for fuel, and several others. "Now,"
said the-editor, "I didn't get mad when
these came, because I knew that all I
had to do was to ask several reliable
gentlemen like you to come and help
me out, and then I could settle all of
them." . When the subscriber saw how it
was he relented and renewed. Moral:
Never get vexed when asked too pay
what you owe, for the other fellow m:ty
need 'the money.

perado who had murdered Sheriff Louis

N(OICE OF REMOVAL.
Shrevenort, La., Jan. 5, 1903.
We beg to inform our friends and the
public in general that we have moved
our mule and horse sales denartment to
the corner of Travis and Spring streets
(one blocK from Merchants & Farmers
Bank) where we will keep at all times a
large stock of mules and horses on hand
to suit the trade. We now have ample
facilities to do what we have had in con
templation for sompe time, viz, to build
up a wholesale as well as a retail market
in this city.
\W'e especially solicit calls from deal
ers in this section of the state to try us
before going further to buy in carload
lots, as we will carry from sco to 250
head of all classes in stock, at all times
during the season, thus enabling anyone
wanting as many as a carload to buy
close at home, avoiding long trips to
market with attending expense and
risks of long shipments.
We are deeply grateful for generous
favors given us for the past twenty-five
years and respectfully ask for a' fair
share of your trade in the future. Re
spectfully, COOPER BROS.
