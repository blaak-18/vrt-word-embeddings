cheeses come under three -geral

and whole milk and cream. The ripen

Savor, is due to the action of bacteris,
which are ever present In milk; also in
the rennet which is used in the manu
faeture. Cheese which has been im
properly handled is apt to accumulate
deleterious bacteria. Cheese has great
nutritive value. It yields nearly three
times the amount of caloric yielded by
