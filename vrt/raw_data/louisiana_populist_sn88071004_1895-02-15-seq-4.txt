true that a goodiy l)rtion of this

of L,~ýgroes, but: this evil can be
remedied by giviug the several

of such trivial offetnces, and under

out the penalty on the public roads
which sadly neae snch work.
Our prohibition friends ueed not
think that the negro will be de
prived of his liquor under this or
dinmnce. The "brother in black"
Is pretty nmuch like the white man,
rnal with the will, heZtoo, will al
way a find the way to get his drink.
Mortover, if all our people are suf

to be believed) must Inevitably
le-ad to a still greater overproduc.

Tl.e negro will seek work where
he can get a drink oeesiloually, t
and there will be found farumeis
who will keep on hand a supply of l
whiskey in order to control labor.
