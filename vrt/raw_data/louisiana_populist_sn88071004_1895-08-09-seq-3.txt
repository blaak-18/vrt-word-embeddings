We had the pleasure last Satur
day of helping to organize and ad
dressing a Populist club at New
ton, in ward 3 of this parish.
This is a small community of in
telligent self-reliant people that
has been completely ignored by
all the politicians, but the club
starts of with 12 members, which
will probably be doubled at the
next meeting, 2 weks hence.
The President of the club is F.
