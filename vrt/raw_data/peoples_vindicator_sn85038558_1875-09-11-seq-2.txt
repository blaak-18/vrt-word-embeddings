Democratic Organization.
We had thought that a quietus had
been given the imovenlent for the re
orgauiizatiol of the l)emocratic party
of this Stute at this present moment
but, we 9nd o learned contempo
rary, th iQuac.ita -'etgrajik, still ur
"ging the matter upon the people of
Nostha Louisiana and demanding ac
tion on their part in the premises.
We admire the patriotic tone of
friend, the Telegraph, and willing
ly admit the force of its argumenots,
but beg leave to demur on the ques
tion of expledliesey a question the
Telegraph has strangely overlooked.
We are impressed with the opin
ion that the refusal of the committee
to call a convention for the re-organ
izatio; .of,A~.Dumocrotic., party was
,based upon grounds welitAkeun that
it war neot expedtent at; this early
day to open a political campaign;
that the agricpltural interests of the
State imperatively required that
there should be no political organi
zatiot, for the opposition would im
mediately tollow suit and the negro
would repeat his seven years "club
g6oig," 'resultieg in the loss of thous
ands of dollars to the planters.
This is our interpretation of the
views taken by the committee, and we
think them wise and so expressed our
selves a few weeks since.
We have no objection to the re
organization of the party and will ad
vocate it at a proper time, but at pres
ent we fail to see the benefit to be
derived from so early an agitation of
the subject; besides, we have seen
references, which startle us, to the tc
tion of Mississippi in spliting up into
factions in the past as experiments,
and a glorious victory prophesied for
her by reason of her late action in or
ganizing the Democratic party, in
eluding, we suppose, the voted down
"color line" policy. These expres
sions come from the journals that so
streniously advocate this party move
maent, and we are constrained to ask
them if it is intended to make that
also a part of the Democratic move
mnent in. Louisiana?
We are willing and anxions to co
operate with the great National Do
nocratic party, but our own success
must be looked to.first and the hest
means :devised to secure it. The
party-the People's party. is already
organized; was organized at Baton
Rouge on the 24:of August, 1874, and
that party is-still in existauce. It
meets the willing approval of all
tpose in this sectou who are not De
mocrats but are opposed to the pro
sent carpet bag rule in Louisiana and
we beg leave to differ with our friends
who say the committee appointed by
the Baton Rouge Convention had no
power to pass tpon the call for a eon
ventiho of the party, #Democratic,
Conservative, or What not. We con
siderfartlher that the organization of
the people in 1874, was the most sol
id, compnpact and irresistible political
orgnnization that has ever existed in.
this state, and itis the only one that
will ever have a show ofsnccess.
-.1 e speak possibly from self in.
terest ip tIits matter, but our people
have been through .the mill in this
parish, having suffered, we are pre
pared to esany!, peetmriarily, more than
any par[ in the Stiats (in propor
tion) by the.spoilation of the enelies
efo6fr people. There has been no
expression looklng to an 'lisa'don
ment of th line hn of pricples, adQpied
last year, from eour citizens;. on the
c8ontrary, 'ft presents to them the only
means of escape from the. clutches of
tlhe Radical vampires. Many Red
River. parishes 're in our condition
and we believe we reflect their opin
ins- when, we sayi 'that no mnatter
what policy is adopted as regards tIhe
National eanvass, the State campaign
will bee'made against corruption and
ignoranoe..
'.This reasoning, speech making bus
iness, has been completely exhausted
and will not be entered into by the
citizens of Natchitoches.
In our yesterday's edition we
made mention of the payment of
Bt&lda's registered paper to the
tax collector. Our friends have
asked us for the information up
on Wich we baaed said state
ment,..which information we are
more than willing to give.
There are some who imagine
t•at the Viwdiestor says mafy
things that are erratic, but we say
to the contrary, what is expresk
ed in these columns, is susceptible
of proof.

oiut offending.

Less Cotton-More Corn.
We hear every day remarks from
our farmers, and that from farmers of
enterprise and industry, of the policy
of pushing cotton to market carey-of
the wrong done the cotton" prodluer
by those who cstimate thie 3icld in
the south.
We admit the truth of many of
their arguments sustaining their po
sitiols, but all the Iharm to the farmer
does not lie in this hypothesis alone.
T'her are mnmany other tliings to be
taken into con.lderation-promninent
among tletifr, and we might sy the
moest prominent, is tie quantity of
cotton planted.
From an address of Mr. B. W. Est
tan, published in the Pica!uae, June
20th, we extract the following, and
commend it to thle consideration of
our farmers generally,:
I. Plantt 25 "per eu!t less land in
cotton and use the surplus for raining
corn, wheat, oats, Marley, rice, pota
toes, cow peas, fruit and vegetables.
You will, by this course, save 20 per
cent in labor, will be independent of
tihe West for your supplies, and in
depemlent of your factor for advan
ces. You will find ready sale for all
of these products you can make over
Iand above your own consumption,
and this revenue alone will defray all
your personal and family expenses
and leave the proceeds of your cotton
crop clear.
2. Practice for a time strict econo
;my, avoid debt as you would a pesti
lence, and enter into no Inew con
traets until you are quite sure you
have the means and ability to carry
them out. Build warehouses or sheds
on your respective plantations, and
take care of your cotton after it is
haled, and not, as is frequently the
case, let it lay exposed to the weather
and then send it forward half rotten.
Market your cotton when there is a
demand for it, and when prices are
remunerative, withold it in times of
depressions, and do not again as you
did. this past season, throw it all at
once into the laps of speculators and
spinners who laugh at you for your
stupidity.
This is sound advice from one of
our leading cotton men of New Or
leans, and should be, not only deeply
eonsidered , but pot into practice..
In other wo.rds, entirely too much
cotton is planted for the demand, and
no meat or bread is made, in sufficient
quantities for our. home consumption.,
What the country wants to make it
prosperous: is, to produce more than it
consumes. To diversify our crops-
make corn, raise hogs, cattle and
sheep-do not go into debt, and it
will be found that the farmer is, at
the end.of the season, in aWsituation
to do as lie pleases with his cotton ;
to sell it at just such a, price as lie
likes, and at such times is it suits
him to do so.
The supply of cotton each year, ap.
proaches nearer tho demand than any
othler known agricultural prodnetiot
-and it should not be surprising to
any one that their ideas of thie value
of productions are not fulfilled.
People may talk as thley please of
cotton being rthe ooly production we
can slip at a proft, but we beg leave
to differ. There are many things
wlhichl can be cuoltivated with sue
ceses mere, that would find a market
at home or abroad, if not that, their
prodnetion would not require their
purchase for home: consumption.
Say we raise rice, cane, oate,, ryet
barley, potatoes, pumpkins, pe, cat
tie, hIorses, mules, hogs, sheep, amd
the thousand other thingp that can be
done, and no one will doubt, or can
calculate :tle saving, to say nothing
of the income to be derived from thenm.
I,ct our fArners begin at once a new
system-a system of producing at
home all that you require for youar
food and clothing;, planting cot
ton in small quantities, and they will
find in a short time the road to wealth
fully opened to them. No bame can
then be attached to cottonmen over
setimating-to prices being ow, for
the control of, tie entire cotton crop
will then be in the hands of thie pro
daecr.
We learn that no defenite uder
standing has been arrived at with
relation toan adjustment of the poHce
jury affair which was in contempla.
tion. Our opinion has not yet been
expressed, nor will it be, for tlismmat
ter must remainto the good sense of
time peoele to settle.

There are per'4oi.4 who are either
from self interest (aud that mostly)
or, from an insante idea tlht it is better
to keep peace at tll hazards, that atre
to be seen daily; in conmmunicltion,
sometimnes on inusiess--most timles
in a friendly way, with men on ihe
public streets oflonr city, who, stand
to-day the proi4onneed enemies of
SEvery principle of honesty and liberty;
who ate the exetisists of the plunder
era of nor people, and the main ac.
tors in the wholesale arrest of our
'ctisfens last Oteolwr. Why they do
so is a q(estiotl of their own taste
and pleasure. anuf we have nothing to
say against it on that score; but,
some of these persoes claim to be
public men ; n'"n representing the
White people of this parish. Should
they not remenlwer that there is an
election in 187,)and at that election
and during the danvass prerioas to it,
there will be a dtbimand from the peo
ple for a showing of hands ;" a re
peating of the pilrable of the talents.
An examinatious of what has been
done by those p4ihlic men to demand
at the hands of their masters, the peo
ple, their approval. We fear that
many, very many, will be in the con
dition of the sarvant to whom was
given the one piece which lie bnrried;
ultand sadly wadtiug, at least in con
sistancy; a contistaney of denouncing
men as thieves and liars, and then as
sociating with tl ese same men as boon
friends. Comeo now "leading men,"
do not forget ithe "beam and the

We were pleased to meet Dr. J. H.
Cunningham, an old resident and es

but now living in Austin, Texas.
The Doctot looks in fine health, and
his host of friends will be pleased to
learn that he intends returning to his
old home prnmanently. We are
proud to know this, for lie is a vain
able citizen w4 all will be proud to
welcome.
The large and constantly increasing
circulation of thie Weekly Vindicator,
renders it a v~ lueble medium for ad

School.
Much interest/is beingj manifested
amouig our leading citizenk with rela
tion (o establishing a Hig i School in
this city. We bre proud !to note this
fact, as our children haves since 1889,
been sufferred to grow ah in idleness
and ignorance, and theifr education
demands our serious consideration.
Our people have been delirived of the
benefit of public schoolsi since 1870,
now five years, and it shotld be in
sisted upon, that there slhould be a
proper division made of the monies
appropriated for school purpoees of
this ward.
Our Committe last year failed to
get a sight of the books of the School
Board, in consequence of the flight of
Myers, and we think that some power
should be invoked to bring about anso
examination of the conduct of affairs
relating to the public Sbool moniesO
during the past five yeams.
The white citizens hatre paid 95 lier
cent of the taxes, and thby demand, as
a right, at least onae &ai the monies.
Let this be given to the High School
to educate such children as are in
indigent cireumstanes. Many eiti
sons are subscribipg liberally to the I
fend to be raised, and iwe hear that
the prospects of sueacss are quite
flattering, i
This situation preses rare adivati
tages in the way of health, climate
rod society. We have buildings,
large antd convenient,: and nothing is
wanting to secure thiq much needed
school, except some little work on the
part of all good citizens.
Crop reports from the country
are not at all favorable. Rain,
drought, and the want of each
have tended to render the farmer
less happy.

Cabbages, turnips, okra, cucumbers,

Northern States.
All the fruits can be raised in the
northern part of Louisiana that can
be raised in the Northern States, ex
cept, perhaps gooseberries, English
cherries, damsons and currents, and
these have not been cultivated enough
to know to what extent they can be
acclimated in Louisiana. In the
southern part of the State the orange,
banana, lemon, lime, citron, fig. shald.
dock, tea plant, olive, ahmonmd, Cli
nose quince, and some other fruits
can be raised .that cannot be produced
in the North at all.
A model farmer in Louisiana may
have an abundance of the raw mate
iials named above, and should make
his year's supply of grape and black
berry wine, and other kinds of wine;
also cider, many kinds of preserves
and jellies, and syrups of different
flavors, all made of home produced
fruits aml sugar; also honey of ex
cellent quality, and plenty of deli
cious butter the year round; lie should
have home made, home dried and
home canned fruits of various, kinds
in abundance the year round, and
home made peach and apple brandy,
and home made brandy fruit, (if dis
tilled spirits are used on the place.)
lie should have wool and cotton to
send to Southern factories in exchange
for Southern made cotton goods.and
cloth. A model Louisiana farmer
should produce more of the comforts
and luxuries of life than the best
farmer in any other State in the Union.
-D. DESNIT, in N. 0. Picayune.
And we find hundreds of men who
want to "go to Texas," for what rea
son we could never undersand. We
have the natural advantage over any
southern State, why should any one
here desire to more offl Our politi
cal condition has greatly improved,
and we intend, firly intend, to cure
all the past and present ills next
year. It should be our aim to call
back all wayward children of Lou
isiana, Who, -disgusted and disheart
ed with negro rule, left their homes
for other States. They will all re
turn, for we see hundreds of letters
that speak still of this being the
Eden.
To a working man Louisiana, any
part of it, presents a field unsurpass
ed by any State in the Union; un
equalled, we might truthfully say.
Law Abiding Again.
Our attention has been called to a
condition of aflirs which are the out
crop of the last three years rule of
"do as you please against the white
people, they have no rights that are
to be respected."

his party attempted, by the election
of P. Breda, as Parish Treasurer, to
flank the law, but, they were promt

Chaplin. On. Wednesday last this
same P. Breda, in face of an injune
tion restraining him from acting in
such capacityj, registered paper ponm
appligatiom& of parties, which paper the
tax colleitor received in fjce also of
a injunction.
Wecall attention to this fact, sim
ply for the reason, kist at some future
time this may be, as there has been
often in the pagst, a charge brought
against eat people as being non law
abiding.
While we are all intent on building
up, or attempting to build up the
country; are not dabbling in politics,
these men attempt ruse de uerre op

The amount of fine fruit that was
lost in this parish this year from a
want of transportation and a market,

ing held at Clinton, Miss., on Sater
day last a row originated during
whichl three or four colored persons
were killed and many wounded.
There does not seem to be any at
tack in violation oflaw so far as U. 8.
nuthorities ire eoncermIed.Mmd up to
a lute hour this morning there hIave
been no suggestions in any way from
Federal oicials which should lead to
the interference of the generli gov
ernment, though Jackun was repre- ,
sented as being in a very hlgh state
of exeitement, sad the offieers send
ing tie tslegvams were of the opinion
that the. State aothoritles were pow
erless to prevent the coatinaustion of
tie disorder. The Attorney General
has telegraphed to the District At
torney and the U. 8. Marhal at Jack
son to do all in their power to pre
serve order-; but-se tlmere as been
no call from the U. 8. kutahloitlos for
assistance, no fbrther directions
have been given. Sbonld application
be made from ofcers of timhe genral
government stationed in the distait
ed places for aid to preserving the
laws or asupporting their oMeail outh
ority, it is probable that the Attorney
general would ask for the assistance
of the military, bat up to this time
there have been no such deomand or
sauggestions.
