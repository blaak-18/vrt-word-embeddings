down to a common Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred a

When the lungs are affected It causes
shooting pains like needles passing t
through them; the same with the Liver or t
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts be- t
ing stopped, and always disappears in a I
week after taking it. Readthe label. c

A very dainty and !overy style of
luncheon is the vogue for springtime gdic
entertainments, and into its scheme
enter all the features, each and every
one, of the pretty table and it setting -
forth. This is known as the Dresden
luncheon.
First oa all it is imperative that the
menu be as simple and limited as good
taste will allow.
Five courses, or Cix. including cof
fee, are now considered sufficient for
the most elegant and formal luncheon
party. A hostess bears in mind that it
is supposedly a slight midday meal
that she is perving to guests who
have breakfasted late and whose din
ner in the evening will be more or less
elaborate and substantial.
Bouillon, game, an entree, a salad,
dessert and coffee, is the accepted
menu.
With this most sensible innovation
of simplicity care is taken that the ap
pointments of service and table deco
ration are as light and dainty as the re
past. That they are very handsome
and exquisite in detail does not mean
that the effect of simplicity is not se
cured in perfection.
The Dresden luncheon is considered
to combine the dainty with the ele
gent more delightfully than any other
design of artistic entertainments yet
seen. The keynote is the bleeding
everywhere upon the table of the del
icate Dresden china colors, blue, pink,
yellow and violet. yo
The fine flowers seen upon the royal th
china are scattered in embroidery over th
the linen centerpiece; on this stands a to
Dresden bowl holding an old-fashioned ne
nosegay of pink rosebuds, hot-house
p daisies with their yellow centers, pan
sies and heliotrope. these are tied Pr

A PABIS BiCYOLIIO COSTUME.
vocating extremes that would be more
appropriate for an opera bouffe queen
than fora sensible woman who whished
to take her exercise in a sensible man
ner.
The underlying principles of correet
dress for the wheel are comfort and ap
propriateness. The carrying out of
these principles need in no sense con
flict with good taste or merge into con
spicuousness.
There is perfect freedom in a skirt.
provided the skirt is made as it should
be.
The woman who rides is obliged not
only to dress with due regard to her
appearance when %nounted, but also
should exercise the same care in re- eC
gard to an attractive and inconspicu- co
ous appearance when she dismounts at ti
the door of her friend's house, the o:
store, or to enter a hotel, or wherever b
her faithful wheel may take her, on T
business or pleasure bound. Ii
The fundamental principal of com- F
fort for a wheelwoman lies in the un- t]
derwear. Corsets should never be worn t,
under any circumstances. Neither is o
it desirable to ride without any sup-.
port for the body, especially if the a
rider is inclined to stoutness. An n
r equipoise waist from which the bones a
have been removed is the best substih s
a tute for the corset, as then the mus
h cles are allowed to have full play, and h
,t are not constricted in any way. Union
ýr underwear is now so universally worn
; that it would seem almost unnecessary
a to recommend it; but upon the wheel
e it becomes almost a necessity, doing
away with much unpleasant thick
e ness around the hips.
A pair of full Turkish trousers, made
I- of black India silk, will be found an
a- admirable substitute for the petticoat
f If preferred, equestrian tights are
a also extremely comfortable. Leggings
a- are stiff and uncomfortable adjuncts,
h and are not necessary. They interfere
with the "ankle motion," which should
be cultivated by every woman who
ie wishes to ride gracefully.
For summer wear, low shoes and
n ankles covered with smooth black
e stockings are the most comfortable.
The form of the skirt is by far the
most important part of the wheel
f woman's attire. It should flare from
the hips, so as not to "hoop" around the
ankles or bind across the knees.
The skirt should clear the ground
about four inches, and be lined with
- silk or satin to prevent clinging. An
e Eton jacket or habit waist, as one pre
er fers, makes a natty and feminine
adjunct to the skirt. This can be ex
s chanued on warm days for the ever
if- popular shirt waist of cambric or silk.
d Given a wheel properly adjusted for
her height and weight and a few gen
t, eral directions in regard to dress, any
[c. woman with ordinary intelligence and
taste may rest assured that in riding a
cycle she is doing nothing which de
tracts from her dignity or personal ap
ci pearance, but on the contrary, she can,
ds by exercising her good taste and never
losing sight of the principle of appro
priateness, soon find herself in the
a full enjoyment of a pastime not only
unsurpassed for its life-giving quali
!or ties, but which will prove itself to be a
be veritable fountain of beauty.--Har

SOMETHING UNIQUEL l
How to Make a servteable Sealo o*f E
nimple Kiteen ucesslhls. bill
A ladle, a skimmer, a fork and a
bottle are certainly a novel combina- hea
tion for the construction of a scale eel
which can be made useful in a small few
way. but they serve that purpose
nevertheless. The bottle is the base
of the apparatus. Two wire bands are
driven into the cork at an equal
height. The fork is then by its handle
pressed into the bent hook of the ladle
and the two center prongs are placed
on the brads, the distance of the latter
from each other depending on the
width of the prongs. By a horizontal
line drawn on the wall the horizontal
position of the scale beam is deter
mined. By hanging the skimmer on
the ladle the horizontal balance of the
latter is obtained after a little moving W
back and forth. The spot where the
skimmer then happens to hang is
marked with ink or pencil. This is the
sero point of the scale. A two-pound
weight is placed in the cap of the
trth
ladle, and the same proceeding of
finding the equilibrium is resorted to.
The place where the skimmer hangs is
again marked. The distance from zero
to two pounds is then measured and
marked on a piece of paper, which, by
means of the divider, is divided off
into ten equal parts, and the first of
these tenths is again divided into
tenths. When this is done the paper
is cut down to the right width and
pasted on the handle of the ladle. It
is well not to lay any heavier weight
than two pounds in the ladle, but this
unique scale serves for all ordinary
kitchen purposes for determining small
weights.
How Artificial Stone Is Made.
In answer to an inquiry we would
say that artificial stone is made as fol
lows: Thirty parts of tin are dissolved
in 40 parts of mnriatio acid and 80 parts
of sal ammoniea are added. A powder
composed of freestone, S0 parts; zine
oxide. 20 parts; pounded glass, 16 parts;
powdered marble, 10 parts, and cal- a
cined magnesia. 5 parts, is prepared
and made into a paste with the liquid
above mentioned. Coloring matter
may be added. The composition may
be used as a damp-proof coating for
walls or for repairing stone work or
for molding statues or ornaments.
