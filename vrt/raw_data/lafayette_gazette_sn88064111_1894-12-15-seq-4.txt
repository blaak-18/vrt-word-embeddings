A. Bugg, of Greenville, Pitt Co., a
sean who has been on the edge of eternity
-ad whoselif had been measured by min
-"It has been twenty-two years since I be
scame a resident of this town," said CoL
Bugg, In telling his story to a reporter,
"even then the first symptoms of Gravel
were asserting themselves but were slight. I
Gradunally, however, my disease developed,
and fight it as I would it seemed to gain a
stronger foothold day by day until amy mia- 1
ery was complete. For sixteen years I r
never knew what it was to be free from
pain, not pain as an ordinary man thinks of
it. but agonizing, excruciating, unendurable
pain. Tortured from head to foot, at times
thrown into spasms when it would require
the united strength of four men to hold me
until I was stapifled with stimulants and 1
opiates. Icould not sit, lie or stand in any
one position but the shortest time. Sleop
was out of the question unless brought about
by the strongest stimulants or opiates. Oh
bow many, many times have I thought of
putting an endato that life of suffering. But
then my mind would revert to my wife, my
children, my home, and I would restrain my
hand with the hope that some other means
of escape would be offered. I searched the
archives of" medicine for relief. Doctors
were consulted, lithia waters, mineral
waters, drugs, opiates and stimulants of all
sorts were tried without avail. Why I sent
clear to the West Indies for medicine and
yet the result was the same.
"I kept at my work as long as I could but
nature gave way at last and I succumbed to
the inevitable. My entire nervous system had
been shattered by the stimulants and opiates
I had taken, my blood had actually turned
to water, my weight had dropped from 1:3
pounds to 123, and it seemed to everybody
that the end was in sight. Why I could not
bear the gentle hand of my wife to bathe
my limbs with tepid water. I was simply
living from hour to hour. I had made my
will, settled my business and waited for the
last strand of life to snap.
"It was at this time that a somewhat simi
lar case as my own was brought to my
notice. This man had suffered very much
as I had, his life had been despaired of as
mine had and vet he had been cured. Think
what that little word meant to me
CURED. The report stated that the work
had been accomplished by a medicine known
as Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.
I investigated the report thoroughly and
found that it was true in detail. Then I pro
cured some of Dr. WVilliams' Pink Pills and
began taking them and began to gel
better. I began to sleep like a healthful
child, sound, calm dud peaceful. lily appe
tite came back and m y nerves were soothed
and restored to their normal condition and I
felt like a now man. But the greatest bless
ing was the mental improvement. I begar
to read and digest, to formulate new plans.
to take interest in my law practice, whict
began to come back to me as soon as my
clients realized that I was again myself.
After a lapse of 10 years I ride horsebuck
every day without fatigue.
,IThat bDr. Villiams' Pink Pills saved moy
life is beyond doubt, and I am spreadiup
their praise far and wide."
