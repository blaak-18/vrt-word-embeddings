Soon to Arrive.
New Orleans, March 27.-With the
river practically stationary Thursday
there has been little change in the
flood conditions. The, early morning
reading of the gauge was 20.2, a rise
of one-tenth in twenty-four hours.
From morning to night the height of
the river fluctuated, reaching 20.3 as a
maximum. The phenomenal speed at
which the current is flowing and fa
vorable winds have doubtless restrain
ed the upward tendency. Rises are re
ported from Red river down. but with
the present spell of dry and sunshiny
weather confidence increases In the
ability of the embankments on both
sides to sustain the strain upon them.
A vigilant eye is being kept on every
toot of levee from Red river landing
to New Orleans.
The local weather bureau again ad
vises prepapartion for a 21 foot stage
at this point if the embankments bold.
It promises that the Red, Atchafalaya
and Ouachita will continue to rise. As.
however, the flow of the Red and Mis
slssippi continue into the Atchalafaya.
.srrying off a great volume of water
from' the main stream and relieving
the lower reaches of the river, the
expectation is, that the prediction of
the bureau will not be exceeded.
Ample provision has beext made
here to care for the highest water now
Promised. In 1897 the levees from
Louisiana avenue to Southport gave
the moat concern, but these are now
considered of impregnable strength
s ard the temporary embankments along
the coalmerslal front are in excellent
Ihspe and as a rule built to a height
,e.abie of resisting a maximum of
aty-tweo feet. The trouble at St.

BURDICK VINDICATED.
This Seems to Be the Opinion as to As
persions Upon His Character.
Buffalo, N. Y., March 27.-The in
quest into the death of Edwin L. Bur
dick, who was murdered a month ago
Thursda* in his home in Ashland
avenue, has ended.
At the close of the inquest Judge
Murphy announoed that an official in
quiry into the death of Arthur R. Pen
nell, who has figured prominently in
the Burdick inquest, would be begun
on Monday.
The Burdick inquest has served to
develop several theories relative to the
crime, bhut the investigation has not
added anything more than an appear
ance of reasonability to any of these
theories. Aside from the failure of
the authorities to secure evidence bear
ing directly upon the commission of
the crime or to establish the identity
of the murderer, there is a feeling of
satisfaction that the name of Mr. Bur
dick has been lifted from the mire in
which it was first dragged, and that
his character has been shown in its
true light. The evidence brought out
under the examination of witnesses by
District Attorney Coatsworth has
shown Burdick to have been a loving
father; always willing to sacrifice his
own happiness and pride for the sake
of his children; that he was the victim
of false friendship, broken pledges and
in face of it all, a forgiving, indulgent
husband.
The efforts of the authorities to fix
the crime upon some one will not end
with the inquest. At the same time
there is now little hope of success in
this undertaking.
NO LETTERS.
General MacDonald Left Nothing Behind
That Is Intelligible.
Paris, March 27.-Efforts were made
to trace the letters and documents re
ceived by Major General MacDonald
from the wafoffice shortly before his
suicide, as it was thought that they
might throw light on the motive for
the act, but the magistrate who has
taken charge of the dead man's ef.
fects says no letters or documents
were found except some unintelligible
scribling which would indicate that the
writer was in a dazed condition. As
a number of letters from the war of
fice were delivered to him last Wednes.
day and Thursday the authorities con
cluded that the general prepared for
his end by first destroying the letters.
The Figaro asserts that one of the
letters received by Sir Nector McDon
ald from the war office on Wednesday
morning was an ultimatum ordering
him to leave forthwith for Ceylon, thus
destroying his last hope of a recon
sideration of his case by the war au
thorities in England: The fact, how
ever, that the general took his life
soon after he was observed scanning
two newspapers published fi )En'glish
giving the charges made against him
and publishing a portrait of- him, is
taken as indicating that pain at` the
publicity rather than any action by the
British *ar office determined his act.
FAR REACHING.
What John Bedmon. Hats to Say of the
Irish Land Bill.
London, March 27.-John Redmond
wrote the following in part ford the As
sociate&d Press:
"The land bill in many respects is
a far-reaching and important meas
ure. It proposes a loan for the pur
pose of enablinig the landlords to be.
bought out to the extent of 100,000,000
pounds, in addition to' a bonus net to
be repaid, to amount to at least $12,
000,000. The bill does not fill all the
requirements of the case./ It does not.
provide as good terms either for the
landlord or tenants as proposed at
the recent land conference, but it
marks an enormous advance on any
measure of its kind hitherto proposed
by-an English government. It is the
direct result of the unity of the na
tional movement .in Ireland and the
National party in parliament for the
last three years which led to the break
down of coercion in Ireland and which
induced 'the landlords to come' to the
conclusion that their best interests lay
in making friends with the Iriph peo
ple instead of continuing in conflict
with them. The land conference

AFTER BUCKET SHOPS.
N.w York and New Orleans Cotton Ex
ehanges Said to Be Against Them.
New Orleans, March 27.--The New
Orleans cotton exchange is said to
have under consideration a request of
the New York to co-operate with that
body in striking an effective blow at
bucket shops. It is understood here
that exchange has entered into an
agreement with the telegraph com
panies whereby the latter will be ob
ligate themselves not to furnish cot
ton futures quotations to any firm not
on a list to be furnished by the ex
change, and Secretary King is said
to be now preparing the list. If the
New Orleans exchange ratifies the
agreement, bucket shops throughout
the country will be put to a serious
disadvantage if not actually elimina
ted. The news of the request from
New York has been secret, but a com
mittee of the. local exchange is said
to have the matter in charge, and the
probability is that a favorable report
will be adopted upon it
