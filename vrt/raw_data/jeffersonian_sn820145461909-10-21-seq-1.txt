Public Opinion Throughout the Union
INQUISITION IN NEW ORLEANS.
The Philadelphia Public Ledger of
September 12 printed a long article
showing how a Spanish monk in
178 8 arrived in New Orleans with a
full outfit to establish the papal In
quisition in this country. He called
upon the Spanish governor, Don Es
tevan, of Louisiana, who was wiser
than the monk, and who saw what
the result would be. The writer of
the article says:
"The monk had but arrived, and
had hastened to pay a visit of re
spect to Don Estevan. From the ship
that brought him over the various
instruments to be used in carrying
out the sentences of the Inquisition
were being brought ashore. So soon
as he could make such inquiry as
was necessary to inform him fully as
to the exact situation in New Orleans,
as to the degree of guilt of those
who had offended, he would be ready
„to begin operations. He, of course,
would act with the greatest caution
and secrecy, and when the proper
time arrived to make arrests and
bring the prisoners before the Inqui
sition he would call upon Don Este
van to furnish such soldiers as were
required.
“Don Estevan received the monk’s
statement with a graciousness that
brought a glow of pleasure to the
Capuchin’s eyes. No one could be
more courtly than Don Estevan, and
no one, the monk declared, was more
worthy to represent his royal master.
“The monk arose and left the pal
ace, the governor, brave in his silks,
his satins and his gold and laces,
holding wide the door and bowing
deferentially to the churchman in
ragged brown cassock, sandaled feet
and broad-brimmed hat. His one
article of adornment was his rosary
with wooden crucifix.
“But once the door closed behind
the ascetic, Don Estevan's manner
changed. The mask of, diplomacy
was thrown off. Tears came into his
eyes and he threw himself dejectedly
into his chair. What would the fools
do next? he asked himself. The In
quisition would ruin the colony, rob
Spain of one of its richest posses
sions, bring the government into dis
grace and drive the people from the
church instead of winning converts
to it. Don Estevan was a good
churchman and a loyal Spaniard and
as such he considered his duty in all
its bearings. He reviewed in his
mind the conduct of Spain in Louisi
ana, from the ceding of the territory
nearly thirty years before by France;
how hard it had been to win the
French colonists to look with favor
on Spanish rule; how the massacre
of Don Alexandro O’Reilly, the Span
ish captain-general, of five of the
- -

leading colonists, whose offense was
the love of France and their protest
against the transfer, had aroused a
spirit of hatred against the Spanish
that only yeaiy. the most patient
and kindly conduct by O’Reilly’s suc
cessors, first Unzaga, then Gaivez
and next Don Estevan himself had
softened; how the French colonists
were won at last to look with com
placency upon Spanish rule. A new
and fearful danger menaced Spain.
“The American War of Independ
ence had turned loose upon the Mis
sissippi Valley country a vast horde
of those adventurous men of the
North, hardy, resolute spirits, who
claimed possession of the greater part
of the valley of the Father of Waters
and who were coming into New Or
leans in larger and larger numbers,
and who were proclaiming openly
that the river should be opened to
commerce. These men paid the tar
iff charges and the Spanish taxes with
ill grace. Some refused to pay and
bloodshed had resulted several times
when the officers of Spain sought to
carry out the laws. Thomas Jeffer
son, a prominent statesman of the
new nation known as the United
States of America, was declaring that
Louisiana was the only place on the
continent the possessor of which was
a natural enemy of the United States.
Only by the most careful handling of
the multitude of questions that were
arising and were sure to develop later
on, Don Estevan knew could Spain
maintain its hold on Louisiana or
could avoid war with the United
States.
“Don Estevan, like Padre Antoine,
acted with a fair amount of secrecy
and caution. One night, soon after
the monk’s visit to the palace, a file
of soldier’s wrapped with their mus
kets on the door of the cell in which
the good father was sleeping.
“ ‘lt is very kind of Don Estevan,’
said the monk when he opened the
door, ‘but tell his excellency I am
not ready to begin. You may return
with the blessing of God. I shall no
tify Don Estevan when you are
needed.’
“Padre Antoine was astounded
when informed that he was under ar
rest.
“‘What’’ he exclaimed, ‘you dare
to arrest a commissioner of the In
quisition?’
“The captain in charge of the sol
diers knew only one authority, Don
Estevan, and without any further
parley the Capuchin was taken out,
put into a boat, taken aboard ship
about to sail for Cadiz and, when the
sun arose, was on his way to Spain.
The same ship that carried Padr? An
toine back to Spain took a letter from
Don Estevan Miro to his royal mas-
ter such as Spanish governor proba
bly never wrote a Spanish king be
fore or since.”
MONETARY LEAGUE ISSUES A
CALL TO ARMS.
Joseph N. Stephens, secretary of
the United States Monetary League,
has issued the following circular let
ter, in which he calls on citizens of
the United States to take a more ac
tive interest in their own business:
“Denver. Colo., Sept. 30.
“To the American Public:
“Friend! Fellow citizen!!
“This letter is to warn you to take
a more active interest in your own
business.
“There is a conspiracy planned
and unless you prevent it, the next
Congress will burn up three hundred
and forty-six million dollars in green
backs! and melt into bullion six hun
dred million silver dollars. This is
your money. It is drawing no inter
est. It is to be destroyed, and in its
place will be issued bank currency
that can be expanded and contracted
at pleasure, injuring the people by
both processes and drawing immense
interest all of the time for doing it.
“The United States Monetary
League intends to prevent this crime,
and it needs your help to do it. It
will cost something in time and ef
fort. Also some money. Os the lat
ter, you surely are willing to con
tribute your share. The expense will
be in reaching the people and arous
ing them to the danger confronting
the country. More than twenty
thousand must be corresponded with
personally. Hundreds of thousands
of pieces of literature must be
mailed. Millions of signatures must
be secured, so the work must begin
at once. Five thousand dollars ex
pended now will accomplish more
than many times that sum spent at
a later date. It has been suggested
that a national convention be con
vened. but before that is done the
work above outlined must be taken
up. In any case, we must assert our
rights in unmistakable tones.
Cowards and Dishonest.
“Perhaps you have been persuaded
into believing that presidents, mem
bers of Congress and treasury offi
cials are august personages. They
talk loudly of ‘our’ administration
when it is ‘your’ administration, and
they ‘only the men on the job’. Upon
them yon have conferred benefits and
honors; they have rewarded you with
a multitude of legislative and .finan
cial abuses. Morally, most of them
are honest; politically more of them
are dishonest; while the majority
are political cowards controlled by
party whips who compel them to
pass laws in the interest of their
masters.
“If we are to stop these encroach
ments upon our constitutional rights
we must destroy the influences ex
ercised by stock-gamblers and finan
■ al pirates who are allowed to com
mit crimes against the banking laws
with impunity.
“If, therefore, you desire to pro
tect your own interest, and are will
ing to assist in protecting ours, send
us a small contribution, making
check payable to Joseph N. Stephens,
national secretary. If you can not
do this, you can assist by signing our
‘petition’ blank, so whether you con
tribute or not, do not fail to sign,
and get as many other signatures as
you can. We need three million sig
natures to place on file in Washington
at the opening of Congress.
“A monster petition. A great roll
to which all friends of honest money
in Congress can point with pride, and
unrolling into another wheel dis
close a great list of names from every
State in the Union. Bear in mind
this work is in no sense political or
partisan, but purely patriotic, to save
the money created by the govern
ment, hence our ‘government money
demand’. The people should govern,
therefore, ‘the people’s money’.
Every dollar equal a full legal ten
der for debt, and no one robbed
when a debt falls due. Simply law
ful money for all, rich or poor, white
or black, Jew or Gentile. But un
fortunately the Wall Street banks
now control the administration of
affairs in this country. Their soap
wrappers of 190 7, and the Aldrich
five hundred million-dollar congres
sional gift of 1908 demonstrates this.
Seek to get this statement published
and you can determine at once what
part of the press of the entire coun
try is also governed by the banks.
Aldrich Will Lead Again.
“You will see Aldrich again lead
in the next Congress. This time to
serve the Bank Trust. Last session
it was the other trusts. The Wall
Street vampires and their agents de
mand that the silver dollar and the
greenback must be destroyed. This
is their scheme: destroy a billion dol
lars of good money and replace it
with ‘no money’, a mere ‘substitute’
Ly which the banks will, under the
guise of law, rob the people of three
to five hundred million dollars.
Not just for one year, but time with
out end, with yearly increases. The
Denver mint is closed to gold coin
age. What does that mean?
