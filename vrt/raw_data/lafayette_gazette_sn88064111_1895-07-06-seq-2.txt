H'> E T MONEY QUESTION
S hession cause of the free coinage of
iyears and gold at a ratio of 6 ton
resshi country to repealnd without thas
=- ;consent of other nations is growing
so d.in.popularity every day. The dis
cussion of this question began two
years ago at the extra session of Con
gress, called to repeal the purchas
ing clause of the Sherman act.
Since then the discussion of this
momentous issue has passed out of
the halls of Congress and has been
-taken up by the people with a vim
and enthusiasm of unusual intensity.
In our opinion the people are right
.and the gold bugs are wrong.
Under our present financial sys
',tem money is getting scarcer every
day and there is a continuous and
corresponding f4ll in the prices of
our principal commodities. The
scarcer the money, greater its pur
chasing power, so that those who
possess the precious metal can get
more products and commodi
ties in exchange for it, than its
fair equivalent. The toilers and
producers are thus compelled to
give too much of their products for
the money which the rich have
hoarded. The rate of interest is
also increased by the scarcity of
money. It is clear if money is
scarce only a few can have any to
lend and it lies in their power to de
mand the rate which they may de
sire. Apply for a loan to-day and
the first reason assigned for a high
rate of interest is that money is
scarce, and you must accept the
terms or go without the loan as
very few have any to lend. If
there were more money, you would
apply t-j others for the loan until a
fair rate of interest was obtained.
We do not blame the money-lender as
all men seek their advantage in bus
iness transactions, but the fault lies
in our monetary system which tends
to produce a contraction in the
currency. On contracts payable
on long terms, the fact that money
is getting scarce falls heavily on the
debtor class. As an illustration,
supposing that in z8go a farmer had
borrowed the sum of $5oo payable
an five yearly installments of $zoo.
As cotton was worth io cents a
pound in 189x two bales of cotton
weighing Soo pounds each would
have paid the first installment,
whereas to pay the installment due
this year more than four bales would
be required. Under such a finan
cial system is it surprising that the
producer is getting poorer? The
gold standard men say there is more
money than ever before. They ap
peal to statistics to prove the asser
tion. The laboring men out of
work, or the farmer who can hard
'y pay his taxes, will find lit
tIe consolation by being told
that according to statistics he is in
a prosperous condition and ought
to be happy. Adn itting for the
sake of argument that according to
statistics there is a great deal of
money, we must not lose sight of
the fact that all of that money,
wh.ether issued in silver certificates,
treasury notes or silver dollars, is
mnet ely token money because
based on gold, which is the only
money of final redemption. Gold
being scarce, a contraction of the
currency must of necessity be the
result. Allow the free coinage of
silver, primary money or money of
final redemption will be increased
by one half and the volume of the
eirculating medium will be sufficient
for all transactio.s, and a sound
and safe currency will follow.
The- goldbugs claim that free
coinage will makesilver-miners mul
ta-, milidonaires, but raise no objection
-against the enrichment of the
-owners of gold mines. It.deed these
:igs with golden wings seem to
Jhwbve aconstitutional weakness for
the:yellow metal.
SItis also axiomatic with them that
Sfree coinage of silver will depre
t dt to its bullion value in
-n.markets and this will se
-. aIect our commercial rela-I
t~ith other nations. Should
Sit will have the effect of
- ra- dxports. Commer
ilc:fl naturally exert them
-sell them for the appre
-d of fo-eign countries.
Frejigners .would not sumjort -as
much, however, as our currency
would be depreciated should the
heory of the golbugs be correct.
In t evenb o peopg ould hav
to > " on a to mrk o supp
thei wasts. $ hadAfacttures
new enterprises would then follow
the great law of supply and demand
and as far as we are concerned we
are willing to rely on the enterpris
ing genius of the American people
to meet every arising contingency.
Whetever may he our theories
our judgment should yield to prac
tice and experience. Facts are
stronger than theories. From 1792
to 1873, a space of 8i years, no
discrimination was made at our
mints against either metal. We
had the free coinage of both on
terms of perfect equality. During
that period thet American people
became one of the leading nations
of the world. General prosperity
was seen everywhere until that fatal
year of x873 when silver was de
monetized. Ever since things are
going from bad to worses Stagna
tion m business, want and distress
are seen on every hand.
