Pain
Weakens
Headache, rheumatism,
neuralgia, or pains of any
nature weaken the sys

on the nerves. Almost
instant relief can be ob
tained by taking Dr. Miles
Anti-Pain Pills, and with
out any bad after-effects.
Take one on first indica
tion of an attack —it will
ward it off. They are a
pleasant little tablet, sold
by druggists everywhere,
25 doses 25 cents;
never sold in bulk.
"I was subject to constant head
aches for a period of four years. At
times I was almost unfitted for the
work in which lam engaged, that of
station agent. Through the advice

L. and the result has been
that l have entirely eradicated iny
?k S ,? those continuous headaches
Wiat follow a continual mental strain.
They have done for me all that is
claimed for them.”

Abraham Reuf, convicted of bribery,
has just been given the maximum sen
tence provided by law for that offense,
in the San Francisco courts. Notice
of an appeal was filed, however, which
will stay the execution of the sentence
for the time being.
Cleveland Hilson, of the Montana
Coke and 'Cotai Co., is reported to have
said that large deposits of coal lie
under Yellowstone Park and is quote,
as voicing the opinion that:
“Some day, probably within the
next twenty or forty years, these de
posits will, T believe, be thrown open
to development and operation. I have
traced outcrops of coal several thou
sand feet in the park. There is no
question but that millions of dollars’
worth of coal and other minerals are
locked up in this national reserve,
and I look to see them opened one
day.”
Mr. Hilson probably belongs to that
class of people who annually go
abroad to gape at the Alps they are
too lazy to scale, and would lay waste,
for the sake of a little material
wealth, as grand a bit of scenery as
could be found anywhere in the known
worlds But such vandalism will never
be countenanced. When the world is
freezing for the lack of the bed of
fuel in Yellowstone Park, it will be
too close to destruction for a few
million dollars’ worth of coal to save
it, and in the meantime Americans
will desire to have some parts of their
own country left worth seeing for
these who cannot afford ocean voyages
to the not greater wonders of “fur
rin” parts.
Jew-baiting is again the sport of
that portion of Russian domain known
as Finland. If the native Finns have
•any recollection of their own wrongs
at the hands of the Russian govern
ment, it is doo cowed to display any
sympathy toward the unfortunate
handful of the Semitic race left in
their territory. Dr. Herbert Frieden
wald, secretary of the American Jew
ish Committee, says:
‘ 1 Within the last few months the
anti-Jewish agitation in Finland has
become more and more cruel. A ca
blegram sent to us by the great Ger
man-Jewish organization, the Hilfsve
rein der Deutschen Juden, states that
many Jewish families of Finland
were being summarily driven out of
their homes on seven days’ notice.
41 It says that the anti-Semitic agi
tation in Finland is growing more
cruel and relentless, and that the Leg
islature has promulgated an edict pro
hibiting the slaughter of meats in ac
cordance with the Jewish ritual.
4 4 This means that those Jews that
are not being driven out by force will
be compelled to emigrate because of
the impossible conditions imposed
upon them. In all this the inhuman
hand of Russia, which now has com
plete control over Finland’s affairs, is
plainly evident. As Finland, as well
as Russia, is now on the market for
large loans, it is to be hoped that
American financiers will not risk any
Csl>e 3effersonlan
TV O TLS
of their funds in these countries where
such cruel and unusual persecutions
are resorted to, which render all in
dustrial and economic conditions in
secure.
4 4 Though they number only about
one thousand persons in a total popu
lation of a million and a half, the per
secution has been carried on with a
severity worthy of dealing with a far
Ipro-r number of persons. Only a
V'Yj small number are classed as ‘na
tives’ or ‘domiciled’ and have the
right of citizenship. All others are
treated as ‘foreigners.’ ”
“Cruelty to lanimals” is offered as
a specious plea, for the prohibition of
kosher (clean) methods of killing ani
mals to be used as food. Whether or
not this be valid is unknown. Cer
tainly no one would fail to condemn
anything that was cruel toward any
dumb creature, buc for the Russian
authorities, which murder human be
ings of-both sexes and all ages by the
must barbarous tortures known to
diabolic ingenuity to put up that ex
cuse for the treatment of the Jews in
Finland, is nothing less than an insult
to the civilized world. Kindness to
animals can scarcely make it neces
sary to turn delicate women and girls,
the sick and aged, and tiny babies out
into the rigor of an almost arctic win
ter.
Carrie Nation has descended upon
Glasgow, Scotland, where she declares
female pri.oners are in z te majority
over the male. This strange condition
of affairs she attributes to the tip
pling habits of the lower classes of
Scotland and England.
Another twist has been given to the
British lion’s tail, in the capture of
an English vessel by two Chinese
cruisers. It is supposed that the seiz
in e is due to the fact that the British
ship ran down ia Chinese junk some
time ago, occasioning some loss of
life. Further developments in the
matter are expected.
Again the palmist—this time one
“Cluero” in professional title, but
plain Louis Harmon, has’ fled with
other people’s money, to the amount
of $500,000 and Parisians, whom he
gulled, are left lamenting. When
WILL people learn to let the char
latan severely alone 1 ? Even when he or
she is honest, in the ordinary use of
the term, their so-called readings are
utter nonsense. Despite the dream that
occasionally “comes true” and the
guess which hits the mark, the future,
even for a moment ahead, is irrevo
cably sealed. Not long ago one of the
metropolitan papers published the
prophecies of the great “seers” for
1909 and although they waded nobly
in with all sorts of predictions, not
one of them had any divination of the
calamity right at hand in Italy for
the coming months.
