Klansmen, Stand Loyal to Imperial Wizard!
SIMMONS FORCES WORK IN
VAIN TO DISRUPT KLAN
Fox-Coburn Killing Entirely A Personal
Matter. Klansmen Should Avoid
and Have Nothing to do with
Knights Kamellia.
Following the killing of Attorney
Coburn by Editor Fox, at Atlanta,
Georgia, recently, which appears to
be either a personal matter or the
work of whiskey or insanity, or both,
Colonel Simmons and his aides and
helpers have sworn out warrants for
the arrest of Imperial Wizard Evans,
H. K. Ramsey, Brown Harwood and
T. J. McKinnon, all high in Klan of
ficial life, charging conspiracy to
murder Simmons. Dr. Johnson and E.
Y. Clarke. Fox is in jail and will
have a hearing next week on the mur
der charge. He does not talk and
keeps his mouth shut.
The matter evidently is the out
growth of recent litigation where
Sixnmoms groups have lost in every
single instance HAVING NOTHING
UPON WHICH TO BASE ANY
FIGHT. It is all malice and planned
so as to get control of the organiza
tion, and their hands into the cash
box, from which they were separated
when Dr. Evans was unanimously
elected for the purpose of putting the
organization in the hands of honest,
clean and American citizens and tak
ing it out of the hands of those who
had prostituted the organization and
conducted the affairs for their own
selfish purposes and enrichment. They
die hard and, after their great graft
was shut off, set up these bushwacker
and outlaw tactics FOR REVENGE,
and to give thunder to the enemy so
as to create discord in the ranks of
the great American organization.
It becomes more obvious daily that
the anti-Evans movement is all
malice, spite-work and for the dollars.
It is needless to say that the Sim
mons forces will fail at every turn of
the road. The Simmons gang are de
termined, if possible, to rule or ruin,
and ARE WQRKING HAND IN
HAND WITH THE ENEMIES OF
KLANISM to disrupt the organiza
tion. So far all that has been attain
ed is one murder, and the outlaws are
largely to blame. The murder of Co
burn is a personal grudge, with a
possibility of insanity as a contribu
tor.
Klansmen, Keep Cool
In the meantime, Klansmen and
others should keep cool and await full
particulars of the cause of the shoot
ing, which will come to light short
ly. The newspapers get nothing and
we have been told that the agent f<Jr
the Associated Press in Atlanta is a
lelative of, or a very close personal
friend of Simmons, so take nothing
without considerable salt that comes
from Atlanta from that source, as
WE DO KNOW THAT THE AS
SOCIATED PRESS AT ATLANTA
IS NOT FRIENDLY NOR FAIR TO
DR. EVANS, NOR THE KLAN, and
about all the news we get from that
section is seasoned with the Simmons
flavor.
Col. Simmons is still doing all he
can to wreck, ruin, exploit ana dis
rupt the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan. He has formed a corporation
in Oklahoma called the Knights Ksrn
ellia, which is a colorable initiation
of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
and, by the use of our roster of mem
bers, which no doubt came into his
hands through some Jesuit by means
of theft or otherwise, he is soliciting
his membership from our rank and
file into the Knights Kamellia, under
the misrepresentation that they are
buying the second order, Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, or K Duo (Primary
Order of Knighthood.) He has also
incorporated the Knights Kamellia
in Illinois and is seeking to do the
like in that Realm.
Note the word “buy,” the second
order. We use this word advisedly.
Why “buy” something that you can
have free. It is purely and simply a
commercial proposition with him and
his co-workers for personal aggrand
isement, tiie Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan is giving this order free to all
charter members. Therefore, why
“buy” something that you are entitled
to free. The propaganda which is
going the rounds inside and outside
of the Klan is misleading and erron
eous and tends to cause many inno
cent Klansmen to believe that CoL
Simmons is inviting them to member
ship in the higher or second Order of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, by
conferring upon them the authorized
K Duo, Order of the Knights Kam
elia. All well informed Klansmen
will refute the propaganda which
points to an acceptance of the Sim
mons order, Knights Kamellia , by
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Principally among those associated
with Col. Simmons in . propagating
the Knights Kamellia are banished
Klansmen.
All loyal Klansmen should reject
any and every advance made by rep
resentatives of Simmons, who cer
tainly are not working for the good
of Klancraft. Wherever agents of
anti-Evans factions have shown their
hand, they are seeking to capitalize
anything and everything which might
possibly give them a foothold, there
fore let every Klansman once more
refresh his memory and recall the
obligation of loyalty which he has
taken. There can be but one stand
taken by real Klansmen and that is
in aboslute support of Dr. Evans, who
is the duly elected head, of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Christianity moved on and is still
forging ahead in Bpite of Herods,
Judases, Neros and others of their
ilk. Klancraft is daily attaining
greater heights even though on every
side modern “tools” of anti-Christian
ity strike with ferocious blindness.
It is time for real Klansmen to de
cide once and for all time that our
leader, Imperial Wizard Evans must
be supported in his glorious fight for
Klancraft. The Call of the North
will go down the line with the Im-*
perial Wizard because all things per
taining to his official acts carefully
studied, reveal beyond any possibility
of a doubt that Dr. Evans is true to
his trust and courageous in his stand
for the great American movement,
Knights qf the Ku Klux Klan.

RESOLUTIONS PASSED
ON SUSPENDED KLAN
Atlanta, Ga. —Six Klans located in
the suburban districts of Atlanta, all
being in Fulton and DeKalb coun
ties, held a mass meeting last night
and denounced the actions of the
leaders of the suspended Atlanta
Klan No. 1 in trying to disrupt and
injure the national organization.
Atlanta Klan No. 1 was suspended
some months ago by the Grand Dra
gon of Georgia because they refused
to pay any dues. Since then many
of their members have transferred
their cards to suburban Klans in good
standing. These suburban Klans in
their joint meeting passed resolu
tions saying that the actions of the
outlawed Atlanta Klan No. 1 must
not be considered as representative
of the ideas of the Klansmen in Ful
ton and DeKalb counties in which
suburban Atlanta lies since they de
clare that the suspended Klan now
only has a membership of about 200,
many of whom have been misled by
leaders who have not the good of the
order at heart. They voted to con
tinue to deal with Atlanta Klan No.
1 as an outlaw organization and to
recognize none of its acta. Since At
lanta Klan territory is similar to
their own they invited former mem
bers of No. 1 Klan to join any of
their organizations by transfer.
Klans taking part in the joint
meeting and who signed the resolu
tions included Copaga Klan No. 96,
Buckhead Klan No. 128, Kirkwood
Klan No. 91, East Point Klan No.
51, Bolton Klan No. 121 and Decatur
Klan No. 42, all of Fulton and De
Kalb counties, Realm of Georgia.

When local businessmen came to
their respective places of business
in this village Monday morning they
found a newspaper had been placed
in their doorways sometime during
the night. Upon examining the pa
per it was found to be “£he Call of
the North,” the official organ of the
Ku Klux Klan for Minnesota. The
paper is published by The Call of the
North Publishing Company and is
edited by P. J. Om. It is published
at St. Paul. The Mirror office, being
off the main street was missed by the
Klansmen and we did not hear of the
visit until Wednesday morning. We
then hunted up a copy of the paper
but have not had time to read much
of it before going to press. Howeer,
in glancing it over it looks like it
might be interesting.—Deer Creek

PARADE,TROOPS WATCH
Youngstown, Ohio. Nov. 10—A
company of field artillery and scores
of special police stood by to quell the
first indication of rioting tonight as
the largest Ku Klux Klan parade ever
attempted north of the Mason-Dixon
line moved through the streets.
Colonel C. A. Gunder, Kleagle in
charge of the conclave, estimated at
100,000 klansmen from throughout
Pittsburg, Ohio, and West Virginia
were here celebrating the “invisible
empire’s” victory in the recent elec
tions.
City police co-operated with Klan
traffic men along the line of march,
obeying an injunction issued to the
Klan, Friday restraining the city au
thorities from interfering with the
parade, and ordering that police pro
tection be granted it.
Floats of the “little red school
house” were prominent in the line of
march. There was no disorder. An
airplane outlined in red lights circled
over the line of march.

KUN ASKS FOR BIBLE
READING IN SCHOOL
Yale, Mich.—Upon* opening a pack
age received by him from the Ku
Klux Klan, the secretary of the board
of education here found that it con
tained sixteen Bibles and a note ask
ing that they be taken to the Yale
public schools and distributed among
the teachers with the request that a
portion be read to the pupils each day.
Alien propaganda which preaches
that the Klan is a “lawless tribe”
has taken a decided downward trend.
K-K-K
It’s awful to be too bad—but it’s
almost as bad to be good for nothing.
To Whom It May Concern:
It is ruled, ordered and decreed that any Klansman affiliating with
the Knights Kamelia shall, upon that information becoming known to the
Klan, be immediately suspended, and membership alone therein shall be
prima facie evidence upon which charges shall be predicted for the removal
ol such Klansman from membership of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
When the authorized second order, K Duo, or primary order of Knight
hood is promulgated by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, your King
Kleagle will accordingly advise all concerned.
This information, instruction, or edict shall be read to the Klansmen
in open klavem for the next six successive meetings of your Klan, so that
all who hear may know and govern themselves accordingly.
Done in the office of the Extension Department, Realm of Minnesota,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, this 3rd, day of November, A. D., 1923.
RECEIVERSHP ACTION
PART OF ANTI-KLAN
ACTIVITIES
Judge John B. Humphries of the
Fulton County Super/or Court Thurs
day afternoon after spending ire
days hearing testimony offered by
the petitioners, issued an order deny
ing the request of D. M. Rittenhouse
and others who sought to plate the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in the
hands of a receiver. He also refused
the plaintiff an injunction by which
they sought to tie up the finances of
the order.
The judgment of the court sharply
and completely answers the mali
cious attacks upon the integrity and
efficiency of National Officers of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan which
have been made during the trial by
persons seeking to destroy the or
ganization. All accusation of ex
travagant and mal-ydministrations on
the part of Imperial Officers of the
Klan were probed In detail by the
court and ruled to be absolutely with
out foundation. During the hearing
books and accounts of the Order were
in evidence and were thoroughly
checked without resulting in the sub
stantiation of any of the charges as
filed.
“This is a situation where a small
group of men some of whom have
already left the Klan are seeking to
take control of the entire national
organization.” So the jpdge Summed
up the stiuation in ma&lng rul
ing. “I have listened to arguments
and testimony for almost a week and
I have found absolutely no reason for
granting either a receivership or an
injunction,” he said.

—K-K-K
Dunkirk, Ind. —TThe Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, headed by mount
ed Klansmen and the Muncie Klan
band, staged a parade here on last
Saturday night that was viewed by
thousands of spectators. The parade
was replete with decorated floats and
the Women of the Ku Klux Klan had
a place in the procession as did the
Junior Klan.
The procession moved promptly at
eight-thirty. The Dunkirk-Redkey
band had a prominent position in the
parade as did the Dunkirk corps and
the girls’ band of Muncie. Muncie,
Hartford City, Redkey and other
cities had a place in line. A minia
ture school house on one of the floats
featured the parade. A long line of
decorated automobiles also was in the
procession.
The marchers were greeted with
much applause as they passed along
the thickly jammed streets. Main
street was a mass of people by the
time for the procession to start and
many visitors began arriving in the
city as early as five o’clock.
Preceding the parade a patriotic
lecture was delivered by a most flu
ent speaker who held a vast audi
ence to the last word of his address.
Threatening weather is believed to
have held the crowd down somewhat.

TRUE DISCOVERER

Proof That Scandinavian Explorer
Touched New England in 100#
A. D.
—K-K-K
Historians of today generally ad
mit that Leif Erickson, a Scandinav
ian explorer of Icelandic family, was
the first known European discoverer
of Vinland, Vineland, or Wineland
the Good, in North America. They
admit also that Leif was the eon of
Eric the Red, who founded the earl
iest settlements—from Iceland—in
Greenland. Also, that in the year
1000 A. D., on the way to proclaim
Christianity in Greenland, Leif, driv
en out of his course, discovered Vin
land, and having rescued some ship
wrecked mariners on bis way home,
was thereafter known as Leif the
Lucky.
Tounced New Fnglanmj
The Scandinavians have been as
serting for years that the Vinland of
Leif the Lucky was not the coast of
Labrador, as it is set down in some
histories, but a portion of the New
England coast, proving by quotations
from the Sagas with reference to
grapes, wheat (corn) and the length
of the day, that the Vinland of Leif
was the New England coast in the
neighborhood of Cape Cod. These as
sertions are strengthened by maps
and calculations in which the ancient
geography of the Sagas is harmoniz
ed with more recent Admiralty maps
and work of the United States coast
survey.
Definite Proof
The Scandinavian upholder? of Leif
the Lucky go further, and since the
contention of some is that Leif may
have discovered America, show occu-,
pancy by buried stones and a ruined
tower, and even more definite proof
in language. The descendants of
Thorfinn, Leifs brother, and Thor
vald, another voyager, remained in
New England, they say, and eventual
ly mingled their blood with that of
the natives, in proof of which it is
contented there are Norse words in
tlse Indian language. Sagamore, of
early New England history, is from
Saga; “Red Jacket," the chief, was a
saguoahr, “rousing orator.” Roger
Williams recorded the fact that sak,
the old Norse word for prince, and the
word sachem have a common origin.

—K-K-K
Xenia, Ohio.—Greene county mem
bers of the Knights of the-Ku Klux
Klan enjoyed what was said to be
the greatest demonstration in the his
tory of Klandom at their Klonklave
at Xenia last Saturday. Over 50,000
Klansmen gathered for the events
and in the evening the naturalization
of 3,000 candidates with a most spec
tacular display of fireworks ended the
day.
The weather was ideal for the oc
casion. A warm sun shone through
out the day and until late in the
evening the moon added its rays to
an already brilliantly lighted assem
bly place, the Greene county fair
grounds. Crowds began to gather in
the city at an. early hour Saturday
morning and by noon parking space
in the downtown section was impos
sible to obtain. The fair grounds
also had thousands of autos parked
by noon, and hundreds of families
enjoyed their noonday dinners out in
the open.
Carnival Spirit Prevails
By 2 P. M. the entertainment was
in full swing. Brass bands were
playing and a carnival spirit had the
crowd in its grip. On the downtown
streets drum corps were marshaling
miniature parades and groups of
Klansmen were busy getting ready
to handle the masses of people ex
pected during the evening. At the
fair grounds thousands of people
had assembled to hear the great
open-air band concert from the mass
ed bands and hear the state and na
tional speakers. Amplifiers had been
set and the crowds that could not find
seats in the grandstand had the same
hearing privileges. Nothing had been
left undone, no detail too small for
consideration had passed the mind of
the Greene county organizer in his
arrangements for the day.
No Accidents Occur
For miles out of the city traffic
guards and information men had
been stationed at the crossroads.
The streets were carefully patroled
by traffic squads of motorcycle men,
horsemen and corner guards. These
men were relieved at intervals
throughout the day and their untir
ing efforts resulted in no accidents
of any kind to pedestrian or auto be
ing recorded. Courtesy was the
watchword and the Klansmen co
operated with the local police. The
Madison county Klansmen who were
chosen for the purpose alone and it
is to be noted that Greene county
will reciprocate at the Madison coun
ty Klonklave which will be held by
celebrating “Armistice Day,” Novem
ber 10, at London.
The Dayton traffic squad of Klans
men handled the thousands of cars
at tiie fair grounds.
From Many States
Tourists from dozens of states
stopped in the city for the city. The
interurban lines with special cars
were unable to care for their pas
sengers. Klansmen from practically
every city along the eastern border
of Indiana poured into the city by
interurban and auto. The Pennsyl
vania railroad brought into the city
thousands of Klansmen on their reg
ular trains and handled three spe
cial trains, two of ten coaches each
and the “Columbus Special” with 16
coaches.
In the evening the impressive cere
monial was held at which more than
two thousand candidates were ini
tiated. There was also a ceremony
held by the women during the day
at which several hundred were ini
tiated. A Junior Klan ceremony was
also a part of the big program for
the day and the total number of 'can
didate? initiated approximated 8,000.
