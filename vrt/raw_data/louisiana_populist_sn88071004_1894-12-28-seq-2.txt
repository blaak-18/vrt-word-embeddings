k STATE SENATOR MONTOOMPRY 'S
re VIEWS.-AN INTELLIGENT VIEW
e- OF A GREAT QUESTION.
TALLULxha, LA., Nov. 30, 1994.
to The low price of agricultural
products, now ranging below the
et cost of production, the stagnati:n
. of trado, the lack of employment
e at remunerative figures for labor,
and the almost entire cessation of
new enterprises are admitted facts.
It is a matter of profound aston
ishment that during nearly thirty
1, years of peace, and unparalled de
.e velopment from the mines, fields
a and factories, we should be con
t fronted with this deplorable con
o dition. Why is it that so many of
', the people of the United States,
it in a period of peace with all the
)f world, and in a country abound
ing in the staple products and ne
o cessaries of life, are in want? Why
P is it that millions of producers are
a- in despair, realizing that the pro
ducts of labor no longer yield a
a living? The tariff agitator answers,
that it is the tariff 1 But when we
a find the same low range of prices
in countries with high tariff, and
9 no tariff at all, we cannot ascribe
the cause to this. The two peri
ods above all others that have
't marked the greatest average pros
perity for this -country have had
entirely different policies on the
iarif question. The first period
was durina the low tariff, from
1850 to 1864, inaugurated by Rob
ert J. Walker. The increase of
wealth and prosperity during that
time was marvalous.
The other period of rapid growth
and prosperity for all classes was
Sunder the very high war tariff
from 1865 to 1873. Evidently it
Swas not the tariff in either case;
t for, under different policiea we
Sthe periods of greatest activi
rty and prosperity known in our
Shistory. Whilst the tariff princ
plesa that prevailed wrer diferent,
Sthe plentifulness of money in both
periods indicates the main cuse of
this wonderful prosperity. The
discovery aof the nrch gold mines of
California and Australia gave an I
addition to the world's supply of i
mosey, whicoh, coupled with an 4
abandant issue of State bank notes, I
gave impetus to trade, awd impart- I
es dw liis to every productive in
dustry from 18~0 to 1860. The]
increas of the natiopal stock of I
money during the war, sad the is
sue of bonds, used as money to '
the extent of about two and three
quarter billions, gave life and pro- I
gross to every epterprise, iad ens- I
bled the high tarif advocates to C
present a plausible statement of I
wha& their theory would acomplish.
t teclose of the war about two t
hundred millos of our mnational i
bMd, were solid anually in Ea- t
roe, ed by 18? it is estimated I
tbs t a st aightw. nhunded mil- t
iI lions of our national stcuiritiO
. were held abroal.
is The money and valuable ex
changes that were sent to the Unit
Sed States for these londls caused a
1 bound in material devel,1l10n,.nt
lthat was indeed pIhenomenal. The
end of all this came in I.;73. wbhen
d the Uni-ed States Government, to
provile an argument for the (c(n
tinuance of the war tariff, began
Sthe insane policy of too rapidly
e extinguishing the war debt. The
Sconsequence was a constant return
|l of nationadl bonds and the exhaus
tion of the money supply that was
upholding the progress of the
country. About the same time
the crime was committed of de
, onetizinr silver, with the result
ti of legislating undue wealth to the
)r fortunate holder of gold credits,
>r and inflicting a proportionate inju
's ry to the debtor cla.s, and also to
e. the promoters of industrial and
a productive enterprises. It is hard
at ly necessary to say that, with the
It retirement of nearly two billions
al of bonds used as money, and the
e- destruction of millions of grncu
re back dollars by Secretary MeCul
e- loch, all done in a short period,. we
p should have hard times, and as
rapid decline in all products of
o skilled and unskilled labor. This
era of contraction of paper money,
commencing in 1S73, ended in 187,
and gave to history another proof
for the political economist, that an
L expansion gives better times and
,w higher prices, contraction works
lower prices, and, consequently,
I harder times for the misses of the
peolple. The volumne of money in
al circulation, combined with the sup
,e ply and deman(l, fixes lrices.
n Froe:u 11,' to 1"<2 there was an
at era of or linarv acii% ity and quiet
r, rcigning in the financi:al worl I so
>f that by close econolmy the efforts
s. of man realized small profits.
Then came the great financial cy
Y clone, pl)rclicted bi-metallists twen
ty years ago, which has almost an
nihilated values, and is now de
vouring the homes that years of
toil and economy have built, as a
retreat from want and a refuge in
s, old age.
0 A crisis in husness is not a new
thing. As a matter of fact, they
have occurred abot every twenty
years in this country, and forced
by a readjustmnt of business on
accounil of over-traidling, and the
altere I value of securities.
"e Prior to 1873 the value of secu
, rities w eo bases upon both gold
d and si: er and referable to either
e for final redemption. With both
i_ these metals at the service of the
e world, as a legal measure of value,
the recovery from panics has often
d extended through many years.
e What then must be the hope for
d improvement and better times
n when the ad.ustment of business is
,upon a gold basis alone ? This cri
Ssis had its commencement by the
t failure of the Barings, in conse
quence of inability to collect gold
h interest upon their South Ameri
acan investment. A lack of confi
dence immediately followed in re
Sgard to other securities, and rap
idly spread throughout the gold
le stan(lard countries of Europe and
-America, until the panic of 1893
r became a national question, inas
- much as the legislation enacted
has utterly failed in its purposes.
h The predictions then made for
Sbetter times, have all been falsifi
Sed.
I This the first c sis among na
Stions since the demonetization of
I silver. It might properly be call
a ed the first gold standard interna
,tional crnes. How long it will
- last and Iht further distress it
will bring, no man can truthfully
Spredict. From the pages of his
Story we can draw no hope of con
clusion as to its final termination.
We are confronted with a new
oondition,.and can, therefore, throw
no light upon the situation by oom
parison with any other era. We
can find no similar condition re
ported in financial history.
For twenty years one-third of
the world, through its govern
ments, has been busy inthe effort
to discredit silver, and place trade
upone a gold basis. Up to this
time only one third of the irorld

vised to enhance the valie of gold

The money of a coruntry is its
i legal stanilard or measure of value,
and when a governluenlt -.,arranvges
its tinanci:dl policy that a dollar be
c(om-(ln d:lare.r with each recurring
year. it legalizes the robbery of
01on0 class fr th: benefit of another,
and steeps itself in cr'i!u as deep
as if it had used the army to dis
possess the iproducers of their
homes and fire4idles.
Impressed with the truth of this
proposition, the farmers of our'
constitution incorporated as one of
the few articles "That Congress
shall have the power to coin money
and REGULATE the value there
of, and of foreign coin, and fix the
standard of weights and measures."
The failure of the government to
observe this injuncti;n, and it4 ac
tive co-operation wtih the holders
of credits, marks te counmmence-I
meat of an era of agmriciult(imal, in
dustrial and c(nmmuercial decline.
It stamps the aoe with noltoriety
for ºrcater c:istrr, t tilh buumin
fami!:y than uan army of invasion
would have dlne with it.s itde ,5')le
march. IIad the governmm--: t vi-
lated the constitution 1by changing
the sttindard of weights andl nmea;
ures, without providing , protection
for contracts under the ol( system
the fraud would have been so open
and conspicuous that no set of rep
resentatives could have withstood
the fury of an outraged people.
Precisely the same kind of a fraud
has been accompllishecd in money
contracts, by changing the stand
ard of legal moe-y from gold and
silver to gold alone. For ages the
two metals have been running
mates in measuring the values of
the world. One has been a chock
up. a the other. Destrog either,
and you practically impart the lost
valueof on(e to the other.
Can we therefore wonder, with
the constant apprecirtion of the
gold dollar, that the products of
the field and factory should lessnn
in gold values annually? And
with the increasing demand for
gold, is there any hope for better
times or better prices for the pro
ducts of iabort
A slight reaction may follow this
great depression evea from a gold
standpoint, but no permanent
prospierity can be obtained, until
both metals are recognized as the
basis upon which a financil sys
temrn shall be so enlarged as to meet
freely the demands of commerce
and trade.
Had we a financial system such
as existed prior to 1873, our pro
ducts would be selling for twice
the amount they are realizing to
day. A dollar based upon the
concurrent average value of gold
and silver is the only honest dol
lar. It is the dollar of the consti
tution and should be the dollar of
to-day. If the value of a dollar is I
not regulated by being based upon
the two metals the efforts ot labor
and economy will be in vain.
The increasing value of the dol
lar annihilates the profit value of
products, and unless we can by'
le, .,tion check this robber in his I
course, the American laborer and
liroducer must prehpare to a ink to
the level of the Chinese Cooley or
the ryots of India.
Two propositions are now before
the American people-give the
country an honest measure of value 1
and a umrency equal to the de
mands of trade, mud prices will
take care of themselves; or, refus I
uing to do this, let the European t
plan be still farther enlarged by t

In the face of fearful o,,i we
Imadle the fight of our life against
the c~rruption, the hrilwry, the
thieving methsods of the I)emcr:at
ic party and for the recognition of
the inherent rights of the toiling
i antd prt(hiucing masses.
We made this tight in the face
of defeat-tM(cause we knew that
we could not secure a fair count.
We made the fight for home and
humanity.
We made the tight for liberty
and justice, and in doing so we
placed upon the altar of the glo
rious. principles we were defending
our future pV-O)pects, sacrificing at
the same time our personal busi
ness. But we were willing to do
this for the sake of the cause an
the success of the movement.
But in the face of the fearful
odds with which we had to contend,
as we have shown repeatedly by
tables in the columns of this paper, I
had we been given a fair count, in
stead of Mr. Ogden having beeon
commissioned, the commission
would have been issued to outself,
because we duly won it in the con
test of ballots.
This is the people's fight and not
!lours.
We made the race against organ
izedt Democracy for the cause of
the people and not from our sel
fishness.
We made the fight against the
syndicates and corporations, and
for the re-establishment of justice
and equity.
We fairly won, but was cheated,
swindled, defrauded out of the po
sition, a majority of the people
who actually voted in the election,
of their own free will, and as their
conscience dictated, said we should
have.
In order to purge the ballot box
es of the fraudulent and illegal
votes, and if possible to rid the
country of the agency that has
honey-corned the institutions of
our commonwealth with corrup
tion of the most degenerate char
acter, and to protect the voter in
his right of sufferage, we have un
dertaken to contest the seat of Mr. 4
Ogden to the 54th, Congress.
To successfully do this will re
quire the expenditure of some $750
at this end of the line.
Of course the government pays
the expenses of contests of this
character, but not until the case is
finally disposed of.
As we have stated, this is a fight
of the people, and it must be by
their co-operation and unity of ac
tion that they are to succeed.
We are powerless within our
selves.
We appeal to the generous pat
riotism of the sturdy yeomanry of
this district, and of the State, who
are tired of this age of toudal bar
baxism to come to our assistance
and help us to route and drive
from our borders this hlrydra-head
ed monster of fraudulent elections.
There isno time to belost. If
you act, you must do it now. The
time is short, and growing shorter.
A strict account will be kept of I
all monies received and disbursed.

I, Old Winn has furnished this and

le while she parts with them reluc
', tantly, she has yet in her borders
r men who, when they shall have
d reached the zenith of their power
for good, will outstrip those who
have preceded them.
rl Wherever we may go, and by
e whatever conditions surrounded,
a we shall never forget the simple
if kindness, the chivalry, the inde

Winn, among whom we lived for
n ten years and from whom we took
i- our companion in life, where our
children were born and where one
lies beneath the sod. When fond
memory turns her pages recorded
i) in Winn, they will be often blotted
with tears-tears of silent joy as
Swell as of sorrow.
We owe much of what success
we have made of life to Winn and
her people, and one of our fondeet
t hopes will be realized only in her
elevation and the permanent suc
coess of her people.
We call the attention of our
readers to the very able article on
silver from the pen of that true and
fearless statesman, Senator Georgo
W. Montgomery, of Madison. This
Sis the man who took up a free sil
- ver resolution of instructibn to oar

- pushed it through the State senate
against the combined influences of

of the recalcitrant members of his

Shas the courage of his convictions,

such a brilliant, though hopeless
fight in the last session of the Gen
Seral Aussembly.
