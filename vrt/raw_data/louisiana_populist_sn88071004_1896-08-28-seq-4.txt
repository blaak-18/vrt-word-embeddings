were enongh to chill thll blood.
Fields of col nl that will not make
i grain to the acre. Flielhls ot' cot
ton that will not make a wtlltnd.
And every other crop has tailed.
There is no fruit, no vegetabiles, no
potatoes, Io sorghum, n11o cane. 11o
peas. no hay and no meat in the
woods. Everything green hats been
burnt up by the sun anld by forest
fires.
It hlts come to a qilestin11 othread
alnd meat. Starvation, with its
gaiiunt features is peeping ill at tl e
doors of 'white andil black.
Not half of the stery of want
and destitution hlas hIeoi told. No
language can describe the awful
results of fonr miointlis dronuth.

A great calamity has fallen on tlhemn
without their fault. lie will he the
noblest citizen anlld the truiest frieiud
of Monroe who is foremost in bring
ing relief to the victins of the
drouth.
But the calamity is too wide
spread to be entirely relio\dtl by
Monroe. A dozenl parishes are in
volved. Let our board of tradle
call upon the great mnerchants of
St. Louis and thile West. Abun.
dant crops have beeln made there.
Surely they will respond to our
cries of distress. Two years ago
Louisiana and other 8outhern
States carried generounl relief to
the victims of the drouth in Ne.
braska. Now it is our time to suf
fer.
O gentleman, do not try to con
ceal the facts. A famine as cruel
as the potato famine in Ireland
threatens our hills. Our nation re
lieved the Irish sufferers, shall we
let our own people suffer for bread ?
Never! We appeal to all who
have a spark of humanity to come
to the relief of North Louisiana.
