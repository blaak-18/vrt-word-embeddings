VICTOR AND VANQUISHEOD.
Though the crowded streets returning, at
the ending of the day,
Rastened one whom all saluted as he sped
along his way:
In his eye a gleam of triumph, In his heart
a joy sincere.
And the voice of shouting thousands still
resounding in his ear.
Passed he 'neath a stately archway toward
the goal of-his desire.
Till he saw a woman's figure lolling idly by
the fire.
" "I have won!" he cried exultant; "I have
saved a cause from wreck,.
Crushed the rival that I dreaded, set may
fh oot Upon his neck!
Now at last the way ys open, now at 'ast
men call me great,
I am leader of the leaders, I am master Ili
the state!"
Languidly she turned to listen, and decor
ous was her pretense.
Anid her cold patrician features mirrored
-.r fth Meressaes -
"Men are always sacheming, striving for
some petty end," said she;
Then, a little yawn suppressing: "What Is
all of this to me?" -
It.
Throtigh the shadows of the evening, as
they quenched the sunset glow.
Came the other, faring homeward, with de
JSeted step and slow, -
Wistful, peering through the dar'kness, till
he saw, as oft before.
Where a woman -stood impatient at the
. threshold of the door.
"I have lost!" he faltered faintly. "All is
over." with a groan:
Then he paused and gazed expectant at the
face beside his own.
Two soft eyes were turned upon him with
a woman's tenderness,
Two white arms were flung about hlmwltn
a passionate caress.
And a voice of thrilling music to his mutely
uttered plea
Said: "If only you are with me, what is all
rest to me?"
1i.
All night long the people's loader sat in
silence and alone.
Dull of eye, with brain unthinking, for his
heart was turned to stone:
While the hours passed all unheeded till
the hush of night had ceased
And the haggard light returning flecked
the melancholy east.
But the other, the defeated, laughed a
laugh of merriment,
And he thrust his cares behind him with
an infinite content; "
Reeking not of place and power and the
smiles of those above,
For his darkness was illumined by the radi
ance of love.
SEach had grasped the gift of fortune, each
bad counted up the cost.
And the vanquished was the victor, and
the winner he that lost.
-Harry T. Peck, in Bookman.

S j AID (to First
Friend) - Master
and missis is in
the garden, sir. If
tl you'll please to
,\ wait here, I'll go
and find them.
(Exit.)
First Friend
(walking to the
w indow)-What a
fortunate fellow
Tom Ralston is.
They tell me he has got a pretty wife
and two lovely children. In such a bow
er of roses his life must be one long
dream of domestic felicity. A summer
idyll the year round. (Sighs senti
mentally.)
Second Friend--lan'tquite see how it
can be that in the winter, but (taking a
breath as if preparatory to a long-dis
tance dive) I envy him this air; it's like
champagne. He's on sand, I fancy, and
just see the fall the lucky dog has got
for his drains. None of your London
fogs, or germs, or bacteria here; 45 min
utes by train and he leaves all that be
hind. When the lease of my little flat
runs out, off I pack to the country my
self.
First Friend-Nonsense; you make
your health a regular fetish.
First Friend-Well; isn't health the
first thing in life?
First Friend-PIossibly; but you'll
never forget your own ailments till you
-.i
'A sUaMMe InDYrL TRE YrA Ro]BOUD."
have to .think of those of another per
son. Take a wife, man; depend on't,
there's no true happiness outside of
matrimony. I've thought a lot about it
lately, and I mean-but, there, you
would only laugh at me.
Uecond Friend-Who's talkling non
sese now? Take care! You'llrecover
from a it of sentiment to find yourself
Firt FriLnd-And what if I do?
When a man- geits to a certan age it's
his duty tosmarry.
Second Friend-Well, don't let us
quarrel. Jaus, fan Ralston asayig he
-- be bored. Bored
Ralston (to g'Te Frfdt l)--roit
have.'t seen th gardens; come and
have a look at them. (Exit Ralston
and First Friend.) .
Second Friend-How jaded we Lon
doners. must appear to yoetu, Mrs Ral
aton.
Mrs. Italstoti-On the edntrary It
was thinking how reinarkably well
you both looked.
Second Friend-You flatter us. tow
can we compete with you who live in
the country, braced by this pure at
mosphere and possessing every sani
tary advantage
Mrs .italston (si.arply)--l eohtider
this the most unhealthy spot in the
kingdoit.
Second Friend (in great surprise)
You would not say that if you lived
in London.
Mss..Lalasto (speaking rapidly)-If
I wished to enjoy good health I should
always live in a big town. Just now
there are two cases of typhoid in the
village, and mneasles anmong the chil
dren 9keep my darlings in the house.
Besides, there's no doctor for miles,
and the medicine is made up by the
schoolmaster, who is so worried by the
radicals on the board that, as he told
me only the other day, he hardly knows
what he is putting into the bottles.
What do you think of that?
Second Friend (visibly paling)-It's
as bad as the middle ages.
Mrs. Ralston-Isn't that dreadfult
"ISn'T IT DSBEADt-tL"
In the house we never know what the
plumber will do; he drinks so. Tom
says he has his. doubts about our well.
By-the-bye, will you have some tea?
Second Friend (earnestly)-No, thank
you.
Mrs. Ralston-Perhaps it's safer to
drink aerated waters in a dry season
like this. You see a large town has its
advantages.
Second Friend-My dear Mrs. Rals
ton, you stagger me.
Mrs. Ralston-I thought I should.
,Jut here comes Tom and your friend.
HLe hates to hear me talk of village mat
ters; so, as I have lots more to tell you,
we might take a turn in the garden our
selves.
(Enter Ralston and First Friend.)
Mrs. Ralston-Tom, dear, we are go
ing for a stroll in the garden. (To
Secnd Friend). There is really quite
a pretty view, and the fog won't begin
to rise for another hour. (Exit Mrs.
Ralston and Second Friend.)
First Friend (heartily)-I am pleased
to see you again, old man. I almost
lost sight of you after your marriage.
Ralston (gloomily)--Of course; a
wife always loathes her husband's
bachelor friends (grimly) unless she
likes them too much to be pleasant;
but a man can pay her back-(with res
ignation)--by loathing her relations.
First Friend-How bitter you are!
Jut it is always the same; a man never
knows when lie is happy.
Ralston- -lie knows when he was
happy.
First F'riend-Nonsesee. What more
can a man want than a charming wife,
jolly children, a rose covered
Rlalaton--Sentimental as ever! You
have no idea of married life.
First Friend-I can at least imagine
a long, sweet dream
Rlalston (sharply)-Nightmare, you
mean. I've lost my liberty, and, accord
nlg to the rules, should help youto lose
yours. But I won't. As an old friend I
give you my candid opinion: Matri
mnony is the very deuce. To begin with,
just think of the economies!
First Friend (nervously)-Of course,
a man must be prepared to make sacri
flees.
Ralston-So might a woman. My
wife spends more on dress every year.
Then 1 have given up my club to please
her.
First Friend-She wants to have you
with her always. How beautiful is true
love! (Sighs.)
IRalston-You call it true love; I call
it true jealousy. If I stayed in town to
dine with one of you boys she would
sob she was deserted. Yet, when I'm
down here, she merely grumbles. No't
that I blame her for that; the place is
beastly dull, and its her sole amuse
ment.
First Friend (taking him anxiously
by the arm)-Surely, you're joking?
Ralston-Joking! I wish to goodness
I were. You want to marry. as a senti
mental experiment. So did I. My ex
periment failed. Sowillyours.
First Friend-By Jove, you stagger
me?
Rlaton-I thought should. (Wtalk
ing to window.) Pretty view, isn't it?
Hello, here comes your Fidus Achates.
I'm sure he's been -talklng about his
health, he looks so confoundedly mi*s
erable.
(Enter Mrs. Ralston and Second
Friend. Mrs. Ralston crosses over to
speask ~to her. husband and the two
frinds tahnd together.)

Cheek Enthusiasm of Members.
The expected sensational effect of
the president's naege -on the Vene
suela affair in the house ewas neutral
ieed by delay. It 1t for hours on Mr.
Sneed's desk tiftopeed aeed seehtiiigly
1 forgottt by theripeMket ~he house
was tet'y intidh li ei. to the arrival of
the message, and wheh its iinpbrtinde
was whlspered aboutgmhere was a strong
underc.arrent of excitement noticeable
throughout the chamber. A debate was
golinhg h as to whether there shall be
three Cottfiittees id i tr the eases for
contested iettd 6r - iteiheti the old
itde of #iI i .otiiittdi to hear Aii ~itich
eases should be followivd.
Speaker Rteed refused to break off the
debate and. have l bens sisietnt's m'mes
sage Ted, and a rumor that he was do
Ing so to gain time to think out what
the republican plan should be gained
eirculation. Mr. Reed was also charged
with desirilng to allow the members
time to read the message, whleh had
come into the chainber In the form of a
e neweaper extra, before the president's
warm advocaey of the Monroe doetrihe
should be read aloud by the cleric in
this way it was reasoned that the hEes
sage would soon be an old story, or at
least the edge would be taken of! the
interest in its contents and its recep
tion deadened.
Whatever may have been the cause
for delay, the message, although re
ceived soon after the house met at
noon, was not read until nearly lfve
o'cloeck
Ex-Spealcar Crisp had in vain an
nounced that there was a message frdm
the president in defense of the Monroe
doctrine. This was in answer to an in
timation by Representative Hulick that
the president was too busy duck shoot
ing to attend to business. Speaker
Reed quieted the applause that broke
out aoter It. Ct~isp's reimarks iand ul
lowed the dreary debate as to .the ti;s
position of the contested-seat cases to
drag along.
Then the democrats began to filibus
ter by demanding roll-calls on all sorts
of motions relative to the contested
seats until it looked as if they were de
termined to have the session end with
out the reading of the message, and to
thus put the republicans in the position
of having set it aside for the day. Ow
ing to this dreary delay, the crowvds iI
the galleries despaired of hearing the
message read and gradually thinned
p out.
Finally, at about 4:30, the contested
seat cases debate came to an end and
the speaker announced a message
a from the president. By that time al
most everybody in the house had read
the message and the clerk proceeded
without interruption until he came to
the passage:
"Nothing remains but to accept the
situation, to recognize its plain require
ments and deal with itaccordingly.'"
The democrats smiled at this and
the republicans started hand-clapping,
which gradually grew until the whole
house was applauding. The republic
ans again applauded and were joined
by the democrats when the clerk read:
e "When such report is made and ac
cepted it will, in my opinion, be the
duty of the United States to resist by
every means in its power as a willful
aggression upon its rights and interests
the appropriation by Great Britain of
any lands or the exercise of govern
mental jurisdiction over any territory
a which, after investigation, we have de
termined of right belonged to Vene
zuela."
The republicans again applauded
when the clerk finished the message,
and, as he read the signature, "Grover
Cleveland," the democrats joined in.
Up jumped Mr. Crisp and Mr. Mc
Creary. Mr. Crisp had a bill in his
hand, and Mr. McCreary wanted to
make a motion to refer the message to
the committee on foreign affairs when
it should be appointed. Speaker
Reed made the reference to the com
mittee himself, and Mr. Cannon made
a motion to adjourn. The speaker re
fused to see Mr. Crisp, who was waving
his bill in the air, and put the motion to
adjourn, which was carried. The house
broke up with very little excitement,
but the members lingered longer than
usual to talk over the message and the
outlook.
" The bill which Mr. Crisp tried to in
troduce read as follows:
"Be it enacted by the senate and house
of representatives in congress assembled.
that the sum of $100,000 be and the same is
hereby appropriated out of any money in
the treasury not otherwise appropriated to
pay the expenses of a commission to be ap
pointed by the president to investigate and
report what is the true divisional line be
tween the republic of Venesuela and Brit
ish Guiana."

Of masterlng the simple principles of trade.
They therefore regard all imports from

e.r *eIMaiesa Coals es so @*3*3*9
The mehfllifi of the 84th eongrem
are acting very ditfell slke the inhabit
ants of a kicked ant heap. They are
running around wildly, trying to iad
out what struck them out and who got
hurt. Appeals to Ree#i have so far
been unheeded, for it appears that the
king ant was buried in the shake up,
and has not yet dug his way out.
Bdyond the annotncement of the
committees absolutely inothing was
done toward acting on the suggesti@3
made in the president's aessage. The
oinmmittee of ways and ~aeans is un
derstood to be trying to arrange some
plan for raising reveaues, but the at
tempt" seems to be of a very perfuno
tory eilterhctet.
If the senate alone, or the house by
itself, had to deal with this question it
would be solved in an hour, but to pro
I duce a piece of legislation which will
receive the assent of both houses is a
task beyond Speaker ReIed and he has
practically admitted it by his conduct.
IThere have been a dozen suggestions
ac to what should be done in order to
provide revenues for the government.
ranging all the way from Ilitt's sug
gestion to the coinage of all the iilver
in the treasury vaults. These two sug
gestions, opposite as they are, fairly
illustrate the state of affairs in the two
houses.
The house of representatives will
have nothing to do with any bill that
proposes the free coinage of silver and
the scnate will have nothing to do with
any bill which does not put the white
metal in the foremost place. It ap
peared for a little while as if the prop
osition to issue a popular loan in the
shape of three per cent, bonds of small
denominations, to be sold to the people
at large, would go through, but when
this propositon reached the senate it
i as bitterly opposed. Senator after
senator spoke against it. Stewart said
*.it was a wrong policy and Dubois de
ciared that the senate would never
pass any bill that proposed a bond Is
sue. His statement passed unchal
lenged.
Silver is the main point at issue in
the senate. Reed's boom and the Platt
Quay combine are the controlling forces
at the other end of the corridor. Any
proposition to reenact any part of the
McKinley bill woulatd be bitterly opposed
by the etmbinte beeause it would at once
put McKinley protihetetly before the
people and would seriously interfere
with the presidential plans of Reed.
The republicans in the house attempt
to clear their skirts by saying that any
bill they might propose would be vetoed
Sby the president. This is a wrong con
I clusion. lir. Cleveland feels strongly
on many stubjects and under ordinary
circumstances would undoubtedly veto
a bill which conflicted with his personal
ideas. In the present crisis, however.
it is doubted if he would veto any bill
that came to him indorsed by both sen
ate and house, always provided it was
a clear and practical method of raising
money.
Although both the president and Sec
retary Carlisle have recommended the
retirement of greenbacks as a method
of retrieving the treasury reserves they
both knew that such a measure would
I stand no show either in the house or
the senate. Both houses have been
pretty thoroughly polled and an over
whelming majority is against the prop
osition.
Several bills intended by their authors
to add to the revenues of the govern
ment have been lately introduced. The
one which has attained the most notice
is that introduced by Representative
Amos Cummings, providing for an is
sue of three per cent. bonds of small de
nominations as a popular loan. For
the reasons given in the foregoing this
bill has no chance of passing.
Mr. Hill, of Connecticut, thinks an In
crease in the duties on tobacco will
bring several millions into the treasury.
Quigg, of New York, is down on im
ported precious stones, and has intro
duced a bill providing for an increase
in the duties. Bowers, of California,
wants a high duty put upon the impor
tations of fruits and nuts. There have
been several other bills introduced look
ing to an increase in the tax on beer
and in other internal reveune matters.
Some of these might pass the house,
but they will infallibly be blocked in
the senate.
The house is willing to legislate for
Mr. Cleveland if it can keep clear of sil
ver. The senate will sit on every bill
that is not silver plate. That is the
situation.-Chicago Chronicle.
