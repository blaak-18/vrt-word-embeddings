All the valley of the Mohawk was
aflame with excitement when Gen
eral Nicholas Herkimer issued his
call for troops to defend the border
from the British and their savage
allies in the fall of the year 1777.
The Americans had good reason to
feel alarm. General Burgoyne, with
a victorious army, was (advancing to
ward Albany from the north and
General St. Leger was coming from
the west with the intention-of sweep
ing the valley clear of all enemies of
King George.
Brave old General Herkimer called
upon all men and boys between the
ages of sixteen and sixty to arm
themselves and follow him against
the enemy. Lightfoot Van Pelt was
only fourteen, but the knowledge of
Indian ways that he had gained dur
ing a long captivity among the Mo
hawk tribe made his father willing
to take him when he himself shoul
dered his rifle to join his regiment.
“Be careful, Lightfoot,” said he.
“Stay with the rest of us and don’t
run off into the woods, for I think
there is going to be fighting this
time. ’ ’
General St. Leger had gone up
the St. Lawrence River and through
Lake Ontario, while General Bur
goyne was sailing up Lake Cham
plain. He had with him some Brit
ish regulars, a detachment of Hes
sian troops hired from Germany, a
force of Tories who had fled to Can
ada and were now coming back to
make war upon their old friends and
neighbors, and a large company of
Indians under Brant, the famous
Mohawk chief. He had invaded the
province and was laying siege to
Fort Schuyler, where he had shut up
the garrison under Colonel Ganse
voort. General Herkimer was calling
the militia, together with the idea of
moving to the relief of the fort.
The Americans began their march
early one August morning, advancing
up the Mohawk. They reached Oris
kany without meeting any of the en
emy. and as they were then within
eight miles of the fort General Herki
mer halted and called a council of war.
It was agreed to send a party of three
men to Colonel Gansevoort to tell
him that they were ready to make
the attack. They asked him to fire
three cannon shots as a signal for
them to advance and to send some of
his men out from the fort to aid them
when they should arrive.
This seemed like a very good plan
and. while the scouts went forward
to carry their message, the little army
under General Herkimer waited for
the signal. It took the scouts longer
than they had expected to get into
the fort without being discovered by
the enemy. The Americans had
hoped to hear the cannon shots early
in the morning, but they did not
come. Many of the colonels and cap
tains grew impatient. They went to
General Herkimer and asked him to
lead them against the British with
out waiting for the signal. General
Herkimer did not wish to do this, but
the others accused him of cowardice,
and even of being on the side of the

enemy. The brave old man could not
stand their reproaches.
“I yield,” he said, “but you will
be the first to run away when we
meet the enemy.”
He then gave the command to go
forward, and the troops started with
a great cheer, little thinking of what,
was in store for them.
Indian scouts had discovered Gen
eral Herkimer’s men while they
were waiting at Oriskany, and Gen
eral St. Leger was warned of their
approach. He determined to send a
force against them and prevent them,
if possible, from reaching Fort Schuy
ler. With this idea he sent a strong
band, composed of British and Hes
sian soldiers, Sir John Johnson’s ren
egade Tories, known as the Greens,
because they wore green coats to dis
tinguish them from the red-coated
English, and many Indians under
the sachem, Brant. In order to reach
the fort the Americans would have to
cross a marshy ravine, which led
them over a stream and into the
forest on the other side. The Brit
ish and the Indians concealed them
selves in this forest, forming into
a great circle, into which the Ameri
cans would have to march when they
crossed the ravine.
Captain Van Pelt was a friend of
General Herkimer, and he and Light
foot were close beside him when the
Americans marched over the road
which led them across the ravine. As
they reached the shelter of the pines
Lightfoot’s sharp eye caught the
gleam of a red feather in the thick
ets a short distance from the road.
He pulled his father by the sleeve..
“What is it, boy?” Captain Van
Pelt asked.
“I believe there is an Indian hid
ing in the brush yonder,” Lightfoot
said.
‘‘ What’s that ?’ ’ General Herki
mer said. “Where’ is he?”
“He was there,” Lightfoot said,
pointing to the place where he
thought he had seen the feather.
Both his father and the General
looked, but they could see nothing.
“You must have been mistaken,” the
General said, “but these woods might
hide a regiment without our knowing
it. Send out the scouts on both sides
as we advance, Captain.”
He rode on and the long line of
soldiers followed him into the wood.
About seven hundred of them had
crossed the ravine when suddenly the
stillness was broken by a fierce war
whoop. It seemed to come from ev
ery side. Instantly the woods in
front of them, to the right and left
and even behind them were swarm
ing with soldiers and savages. The
American troops that had not already
crossed turned back and tried to save
themselves by flight, just as General
Herkimer had predicted that they
would. The Indians pursued them,
and more of them were killed for
being afraid than would have fallen
if they had tried to help their com
rades. They met the fate that cow
ards usually meet.
Close after the warwhoop came a
volley of shots from the enemy.
Lightfoot could see the flashes of
TJeffersoniaft
the guns from behind the trees,
where the British soldiers lay hid
den, and he could hear the bullets
go clipping through the leaves about
them. General Herkimer’s horse
reared, throwing his rider to the
ground, and then fell backward.
He had been shot and the bullet that >
killed him also pierced the General’s
leg, breaking it below the knee, so
that he could not walk.
“They’ve hit me, boys!” he cried
to Lightfoot. “Take the saddle off
the horse and put it where I can sit
on it under that tree. ’ ’
He pointed to a large pine tree on
the top of a small knoll, from which
it was possible to see for some dis
tance into the wood on every side.
Lightfoot with some difficulty man
aged to unbuckle the saddle and
place it where he had been told. The
General, meanwhile, had bound his
neckcloth around his leg and twisted
it tight with a stick, so as to stop
the flow of blood from his wound.
When he had done this he crept up
the knoll to the saddle, upon which,
with the help of Lightfoot, he seated
himself, leaning his back against the
trunk of the tree.
On every side there was the great
est confusion among the Americans.
They had been taken wholly by sur
prise and did not know which w T ay to
turn. Many of them fell at the first
volley as they stood huddled together
in the open road. But by the time
General Herkimer had established
himself under the pine the survivors
had scattered to both sides of the
road and had concealed themselves
as best they could behind tree trunks,
where they began to return the fire
of the enemy.
Lightfoot was greatly excited and
he looked everywhere for his father,
who had left them to carry out
General Herkimer’s orders before
the firing began. It was the first
time that Lightfoot had ever been in
a battle and he wondered how the
General, wounded as he was and sur
rounded by foes, could face the dan
ger so calmly.
“I want you to stay here with me,
boy, ’ ’ General Herkimer said, kind
ly. “Sit down here beside me. Who
knows but I shall need your help?”
Lightfoot obeyed, although he ex
pected every moment that one of the
bullets which were flying through the
wood in every direction would hit
him. The General seemed to be
struggling to get something out of
the pocket of his- coat, Lightfoot
saw with surprise that it was the
long stemmed pipe that ho was so
fond of smoking. He helped him to
extricate it and to light it. When
this had been done the wounded
General leaned back in apparent
comfort, smoking away unmindful
the rattle of the shots and the
fierce shouts and cries that filled
the wood.
There was no more desperate con
flict in the Revolution than the bat
tle of Oriskany. The men of the
valley, knowing that if they should
give way they could expect no
mercy from the Indians anfl that
their homes would be left defence-
less behind them, fought with the
greatest bravery. But the British
and Tories poured a constant fire
upon them, and the savages crept
from shelter to shelter, and when
they had fired rushed in with their
knives and tomahawks before they
had time to reload their rifles. In
this way a large number lost their
lives.
Although more than one bullet
struck the tree trunk over the heads
of General Herkimer and Lightfoot,
bgth of them escaped injury, and
the sight of the General sitting in
full view and watching the combat
added greatly to the courage of the
of the Americans. They were all
skilled marksmen, and they soon
began to repay the losses they had
met in the first attack. But fight as
they would, the British and their
allies still pressed upon them, and
every moment it looked as though
they would be overwhelmed.
While the result of the contest
hung in doubt and the fighting was
hottest there came a crash of thun
der, and in a moment more the rain
began to fall in a blinding deluge.
The firing ceased, as the downpour
made it impossible to load with dry
powder. By common consent both
sides drew back a little for a truce
jvihile the storm lasted and the offi
cers gathered around General Herki
mer panting from their exertions.
“You have done well,” the Gen
eral said to them. “Stand fast and
you will win the victory. Let two
men instead of one lie behind each
tree, and fire in turn.”
He also gave orders for posting the
men in better positions so that it
would be impossible for the enemy
to get behind them and his directions
were carried out under cover of the
storm, which prevented the British
from seeing what w r as being done.*’
As soon as the rain ceased the
combat was renewed and the wisdom
of his orders was quickly shown.
The Indians, as before, ran forward
whenever they saw the flash of a
rifle, expecting to find its owner an
easy prey, but now a second bullet
laid them low before they could come
within striking distance and they
were compelled to give up this mode
of attack.
Lightfoot had grown accustomed to
the fighting and he found that he
could watch the battle without ex
pecting every moment to feel him
self struck. lie saw the men led by
Lieutenant Jacob Gardenier attacke'd
by a body of the Greens. -One of
them was made prisoner, but the
Lieutenant sprang forward and
killed his captor with his bayonet.
Several of the Greens rushed upon
the Lieutenant and bore him to the
ground. Lightfoot could see them
thrusting at him with their payonets,
but the Lieutenant pulled one of
them down upon him and held him
against his body as a shield so that
the others could not reach him.
The Americans came to his aid and
he was liberated, but not before he
had slain another of his assailants.
