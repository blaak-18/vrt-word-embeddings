011 LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE || O
AN UNSUPPOSABLE CASE.
Dear Sir: —Some weeks ago you
had an editorial in one of your pub
lications sympathizing with the fire
men who had “struck” upon the
Georgia Railroad. So far as your
sympathies go they coincide with
mine, however, there is more con
nected with the issue than mere sym
pathy.
Knowing you to be a student of
political economy, as well as the gen
eral welfare of mankind, I have de
cided to ask your views upon certain
issues that have and will continue
to grow out of this strike in question
as long as we have the negroes
among us.
The point I would like to hear from
you upon is this: Suppose that plow
ing the soil, picking cotton, splitting
rails, in fact any labor that we call
common, should demand the same
wages and the hope of promotion
that the fireman of a locomotive
does, do you think that negroes would
have to work under the same disad
vantages as he now’ does upon the
Georgia Railroad? If so, what are
we to do with the negro? It is an
evident fact that we have him to
feed, clothe and educate. In fact,
we are, as you might say, his guar
dians, and the time has about ar
rived that our wards have reached
their majority and a settlement is
on hand between our wards and our
selves. In the name of all that is
righteous, what can we do?
I am sure that there are a vast
number of your readers who would
like to hear you upon this question.
To our mind, it is the one question
that confronts our republic today.
The statesman that can carry us
through this crisis will evidently be
entitled to a niche in the Hall of
Fame.
Yours truly,
ANXIOUS INQUIRER.
A LETTER THAT RINGS TRUE.
Well, I have never written any
thing for a paper in my life, but as
the boys are giving their ideas about
what we, the People's party, ought
to do I just want to say a few 7
words.
The proposition to organize, or to
hold a conference and all come to
gether and agree on a platform is
all right, provided you make the
right kind of a platform, but sacri
fice no principle for the sake of unit
ing, for it does seem to me that our
platform is good enough for any
one that really wants reform.
But, now, to reach the people and
get them interested in our cause,
how are we going to do this? It
won’t do to hold a convention or a
conference and pass a few’ resolu
tions and then go home • and sit
down and do nothing else, but we
need an abundance of good reform
literature distributed among the
people, and then we need some good
speakers that have the cause at
heart to go out and preach it to
them and get them aroused on the
subject, but they can’t do this for
nothing; they must be paid some
thing for their time and expenses.
Now are we willing to make any
sacrifice for the cause? Now my
proposition is this, let’s begin right
now to raise a campaign fund; let
ten thousand Populists agree to pay
three dollars a year, or 25 cents a
month, from now till the next elec
tion is over, this fund to be man
aged by the National and State com
mittees of the People’s party.
Now, I am just a little one-horse
farmer and not able to do much, but
will go into this agreement now;
who will join me?
Boys, if you think this a good
proposition just sit right down and
write the Jeffersonian a postal say
ing you will be one of the ten thou
sand. If we will do this I think
we can do some good, if not don’t
know whether we will do much good
or not.

A Pledge
How many of the friends of Hon. Thos. E. Watson will
pledge themselves to secure FIVE new subscribers to either his
Weekly or Monthly Jeffersonian during the month of Sep
tember ? I FOR ONE. Just think what a stimulant this
would be to one who is giving his time and brain to the cause
of the people. If you mean business, “Make a noise” like
business.

A THOUGHTFUL LETTER ON A
GREAT PROBLEM.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —Your card
of the 18th inst. lies before me. In
reply, I would say that at the time I
wrote you the firemen on the Geor
gia Railroad were out on a strike
and a board of arbitration was try
ing to adjust the differences between
the road and its firemen. Os course,
“the negro’’ was the primary cause
of the strike. The point I w y anted
you to discuss was this: Suppose the
arbitrators had found the negro
(ineligible, as it were,) to be fire
men, would not that have been suffi
cient to have removed the negro
i’rom all positions where he should
come in contact with white labor?.
Take this as an illustration: Farm la
bor is made easy by machinery, also
the price of farm labor has gone up
sufficiently high as to make it as
profitable to work on the farm as to
fire an engine or be an engineer, and
the chances for promotion is the same
on the farm as on the railroad,
where would the negro land? In
fact, what is to be the ultimate dis
position of the negro here in the
United States, where he is always in
competition with white labor? He
is dead politically, regardless of dis
franchisement, yet is he not more
dangerous from an economical point
of view? It is a national and not a
local question, this race question is,
and as citizens they have all the
rights of the whites, yet we all know
the day will never come in any art of
this country where the negro will be
allowed to work over the white man.
Our cities are congested by our
whites going from the country, the
negro also follows him to the cities
/Jeffersonian
and towns, yet, with all this, our
country is rapidly filling up, and some
body has got to remain in the coun
try, and some of those in the towns
and cities must ultimately return to
the country.
When we are filled up with the
white people, and it will not be long,
where will the negro go?
Knowing you to be a close student
of political economy, as well as a
student of human affairs, tempted
me to ask you to write upon this line,
“The ultimate chance of the negro,
or his future destiny in America.”
The young negro of today does not
compare with the negro of thirty
years ago, neither does the young
white man have the same sympathy
for the negro that men of your and
my age have. This being true, it
seems to be but a short time before
the negro will no longer be tolerated
among us. It is time that some states
man was figuring upon the negro
problem differently to what it has
been heretofore. lam aware that the
newspapers and magazines of today
are full of the “race problem,” but
it is all a dream. The education of
the negro is bound to come; we had
as well look it in the face. Educa
tion will be his ruin, but the white
people are determined that he shall
have it. Industrial education will
only place him more fully in compe
tition with white labor. Yet the cry
is to give it to him, and he is taking
it.
To my mind, I consider this prob
lem (the negro) above all others to
us today. I can’t hardly conceive
how the races can remain as they are
for another generation. I will say
here that I am no fanatic upon this
question, I don’t hate the negro, if
it was in my power I would give him
equal justice in the courts if no
where else; yet we all know that the
negro stands no chance in court to
day.
I hope I have made myself clear in
a rambling way. I am no writer,
just an ordinary village physician. I
was raised in Jefferson County, and
from my childhood I have been ac
customed to negroes, hence this is
not a nightmare with me.
I would be glad to see some one
of your ability treat this subject. I
am aware that whoever does it will
have to be radical, yet we have the
condition that demands it. This ques
tion is bound to come to the front,
and to meet it the people had as well
begin to prepare. If you decide to
take it up will you kindly advise me
which of your publications you will
publish it in? I depend upon the
news stands for your writings. How
ever, I wish to subscribe for the one
you take this subject up in, if at all.
You will please pardon the length
of this, I got to going and couldn’t
stop; however, I know your time is
too valuable to take up so much of
my opinions.
With best wishes, I am,
Yours very truly,
CITIZEN.

AN APPRECIATION OF THADEUS
PICKETT.
Editor Jeffersonian:—The Rev.
Thadeus Pickett is dead. He was
one divine who was the people’s
friend. He was not a demagogue in
politics nor in religion. To “Love
thy neighbor as thyself, and to do
unto others as you would have them
do unto you,” was the cardinal and
dominating motive of his life. When
weary in the arduous marts of life,
when despondency seemed to almost
overtake him and the battle for the
right almost ready to meet its Water
loo, the cheerful spirit of Thad.
Pickett, with his optimistic nature,
would tell him just beyond the little
eminence was the dawn of a new vic
tory over some old dogma that had
oppressed humanity. We shall miss
his intrepid spirit of the pulpit, this
noble commoner, this regal friend of
the masses.
Let those who watched his career,
those who believed in the philosophi
cal truths he enunciated; those in
sympathy with a great creed of hu
manity, commemorate his royal
memory by carrying forward the no
ble work that he was so intensely en
listed in.
It is fortunate for the masses in
deed, in Church as well as in State,
that along the tiresome highway we
all tread, is ever now and then posted
an inspiring mile-post like Thad.
Pickett. To the cause he espoused,
he was a pillar of fire by night and a
cloud by day. He never paused in
the battle of progress to ask whether
or not this or that was popular. The
only incentive that inspired him no
bly on to a grand discharge of duty
was, if it is right, I owe it to hu
manity. This generation has pro
duced but few men who loved the
people like Thad. Pickett loved them,
who is as true to them as he was.
Our friend is dead. Every great
truth has lost one of its best friends,
but the spirit of the illustrious de
parted will impel us on, and now
more than ever we consecrate and
concentrate our purposes more closely
to the noble work, where he left off,
than ever before. Sacred be his pure
and honorable memory. Confident
are we of his everlasting reward in
the realms of infinite bliss, and to
his weeping wife, noble sons and
daughter, we extend in this hour of
their bereavement our profound con
dolence.
