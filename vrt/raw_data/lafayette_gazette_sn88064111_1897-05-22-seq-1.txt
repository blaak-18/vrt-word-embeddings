THE REPAIRS
Are Completed and the Jail is Now
in Good Condition.
The parish jail is now in excel
lent condition. The repairs re
cently made to it by Mr. J. Har
mon, the capable representative of
the Pauly Jail Building and Manu
facturing Company, are completed
and have been accepted by Mr.
Wm. Clegg, the supervising archi
tect, and also by the Police Jury.
The jail as it is now is all that
could'be desired. It is a neat and
strong structure, and with proper
care it should give entire satisfac
tion. A system oft desiccating and
evaporating the offal of the prison
has been put in and it is thought
will prove to be a very successful
mode of disposing of the refuse.
Heretofore this has been a constant
source of worry to the authorities.
The jailer's apartments are airy
and roomy, and that officer can
have no complaint on that score.
An elegant bathing-room with a
neat washing-basin will add to his
comfort. Two bathing-tubs will
afford splendid opportunities to the
prisoners to keep clean. Under the
old system this luxury was denied
the inmates of the parochial bas
tille; now they will have to indulge
in it whether or not they are inher
cntly opposed to the use of water
for washing purposes. It may
prove a cruel hardship on the old
timers, but the jailer is determined
to enforce this rule as a sanitary
measure.
The three old cells have been en
tirely renovated and are almost as
good as'when they were new. The
three new cells are thoroughly up
to-date; in each one four cots can
be placed without crowding the oc
cupants. The cells are sufficiently
large and very airy. The "eccen
tric lock" is a decided improve
ment and is much safer than the
locks used on the old cells.
The jail is painted throughout,
and, as we said before, it is in first
class condition.
There are many other improve
ments which we will not mention.
The Police Jur.y has acted wisely
in using the peolple's mhnney to make
these much-needed repairs and it
also showed good judgment in se
curing the services of Mlr. Wn.
Clegg to supervise the work. Mir.
Clegg has devoted considerable
time to see that the work was prop
erly and intelligently performed.
NEWSPAPER CRITICISMS
Itesult In a Fist Fight and a
Duel.
Quite a sensation was created
last Monday when two residents of
this town met in physical combat.
In the list issue of the Advertiser
an article was published which re
flected upon the gentlemen in
charge of the recent municipal elec
tion. Mr. D. J. Veazey, one of
the commissioners of the election,
met Mr. H. A. Vandercruyssen,
editor of the Advertiser, and after
exchanging a few words engaged in
a fight with him. Mr. Veazey be
ing a stronger man than his adver
sary, overpowered him and evi
dently had the best of the en
counter when Messrs. Alfred He
bert and Albert Steen interceded
and separated the combatants.
A short while after the occurrence
Mr. Veazey received a challenge to
a duel from Mr. Vandercruyssen.
The challenge was accepted and
friends of the principals lost no
time to arrange the particulars for
a meeting on the field of honor.
The duel came off the same after
ion.
One shot was fired by each at a
distance of 2S paces.
Nobody was hurt.
Dt. SA. R. Trahan visited New
Orleans this week.

provide for the comfort and pleasure of the
children and their guests.

News Items Picked Up by The Gazette
Correspondent.
Mrs. Bernard, of Baldwin, is on
a visit to her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
John Price.
Mr. and Mrs. F. Clark of Lafa
yette, were visitors in Scott last
Sunday.
Mr. J. J. Price made a flying trip
to Franklin during the week.
The artist, Eli Gonsulin, of
Rayne, was up on his bike last
Tuesday.
The Scott base ball club lost the
game at Pillette last Sunday. Our I
nine needs some practice, then it
should tackle Pillette, Lafayette, I
Rayne and others. We have good ]
material.
Where there is a will there is a
way. Therefore with a good will i
we can easily find a way to build a
church. A town without a church
is hardly a place for a human to
live, hence the draw-back to our
little town for several years. Now
since the prospects for a place of
worship look bright, the people
are looking to our village and
country, and new comers are with
us and more are to come. Should the
matter drop for want of courage
and energy, your humble servant
will "emigrate" to a more christian
ized port, where his little ones
will be afforded an opportunity to
be reared under the moral in
flunces of mother church. The
people demand a church, and that
we presume, is sufficient evidence
that we will have one, should the
wheel of prosperity continue to turn.
Our friend, Dr. Mayer, of Ope
lousas, was among us during the
week and will give us a helping
hand towards building a church.
SWe are having nice weather
though rather cool for young cot
ton, still the farmers are not com
plaining as the last rain was a
blessing.
Mrs. Louis Budro, mother of our
ppular Southern Pacific agent,
after a visit of a few weeks, re
turned to Franklin last Wednesday.
The painters will be busy the
I next few days on the Doucet resi

be one more addition to that ave
nue, giving it a good appearance.
Mr. P. A. Delhomme has been
busy for several days doing the
assessment act among our neigh
bors.
Mr. T. Mouton, deputy sheriff,
was among us during the week.

Attention is called to the notice
of Prof. R. C. Greig, published in
another column. Prof. Greig will
run a private school during the va
cation of the public schools.
Meeting of the Ladies' Club.
The entertainment of the Ladies'
Five o'clock Tea Club Thursday by
Mrs. Walter Mouton was distin
guished by the usual tact and grace
which this lady possesses in an emi
nent degree as hostess and made
her entertainment one of the most
r charming in the Club's history.
Miss Maud Boas, in a clear, well
cultured voice, sang "Blue Eyes"
to the delight of her hearers. A
vocal solo by Miss Clye Mudd
,ended the appointed programme.
SAt this juncture the hostess ushered
her guests to the dining-room,
where, "while opening blooms dif
fused their sweets around" sweets
of a more substantial nature were
daintily served and much enjoyed.
In the geographical contest which
followed the whole club was victo
rious, but in the tie for the prize
Mrs. N. P. Moss bore off the pretty
trophy.
Young man buy a new straw hat

ANNUAL EXHlBBITION
Of the Whittington Schogl in Anse s
BIerlucheau.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
Friday, the 7th instant, having it
been selected for the exhibition, b
early the pupils of the school, num- c
bering about one hundred, made
their appearance atd were seated si
just in front of the teacher's desk. a
The ladies were offered seats by the e,
teacher right behind the school
children, and the very spacious d
school room was crowded by ladies I
and children forming an array of b
youthfulness and cheerfulness most d
refreshing and beautiful to behold. to
Mr. C. F. Latiolais, the zealous b
and energetic superintendent of the r
parish public schools, arrived be- n
fore the time assigned for the cere- 1
mony. He was received by the a
teacher and introduced to the n
ladies seated inside of the school
house and then to the men standing b
outside of it. d
The local brass band, under the s
able direction of Prof. Dauriac, o
composed of pupils of the school, a
took their seats to the right of the k
teacher's platform and discoursed P
at short intervatls some very lively i,
music. t
The program was as follows: p
i. Just at one o'clock Mr.C
Philip Martin, the teacher in charge c
of the school, delivered an address t'
on "The advantages to be derived a
from a regular attendance at
school." Among many other t
interesting things, Mr. Martin, in t
forcible words said: "*That ae
child to become a faithful christian,
a useful citizen and a successful c
business man, needs to receive as C
much instructton as the parents can s
afford to give him, and it is one of d
the greatest duty of parents to send t
him regularly to school and as long t
a time as possible."
2. Rendition of twelve very in- s
teresting dialogues by the pupils of ti
the xst class. F
3. Recitation in French of g
twenty "Fables of Lafontaine," by c
the young girls of the school. a
4. Recitation of some of the
best pieces of poetry found in the r
fourth or fifth readers by the pupils C
of the 2nd class; and some easier i
ones adapted to the young children c
conposimg the 3rd class. c
5. Translation from English to r
French, the native tongue of all the c
pupils of the school, to enable them
to understand the meaning of their a
lessons in English. Most of the
children recited their speeches very
well and all of them were notice- d
able for their good behavior.
6. Before concluding the ex
hibition and in a few words, the f
teacher expressed his sincere thanks a
to the numerous spectators, about i
5oo in number, for their presence t
at the ceremony, for the many acts s
of kindness bestowed upon him by 1
the good people of Anse Berlucheau a
and for their great support in send- F
ing every year over one hundred
children to his school, urging them n
to continue or even to increase that
number if possible.
Then the school room was
turned over to the young people,
who enjoyed themselves with great s
delight in the art of Terpsichore till
sundown.
Mr. Latiolais expressed to the
teacher, Mr. P. Martin, his satis- e
faction for such a delightful enter- s
tainment, and many were the ex- 1
pressions of satisfaction the old
teacher received from the patrons S
of his school, for his efficiency, r
honesty and the hard work he has I
done to buid up and maintain such c
a large school. s
The whole exhibition was a saic- '
cess and it is hoped that it will
accomplish the end for which it
was given, i. c., to interest more
and more the people in the eduta
tional welfare of their children. i

SCHOOL CHILDREN
Spend a Day in the Woods-An
Enjoyable Piceic.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
On Thursday, May 13, the public schools
in and around Carencro held their aunual
picnic. The day to, all appearances was a
bad one. In the morning an ugly black
cloud could be seen in the South, which
bore bad tidings to all the picnic-goers; but
as the morning advanced, the weather
seemed to brighten, and so did the spirits of
the children, who could be seen running to
and fro preparing for the day's frolic. As
early as 9 o'clock vehicles and wagons of
all descriptions could be seen making their
way toward the woods, to participate in the
day's enjoyment. The site chosen for tale
camp was the woods just outside of Car necro
by the side of Vermilion Bayou. Vermilion
bayou is a large body of water, and
I do not think it amiss to give a little
discrption of it here. The Vermilion bayou
takes its rise from a small puddle of water
completely covered by luxuriant grass and
black berry briar. The course is westerly,
running about half a mile; from thence it
turns to the North straightening out into a
narrow stream, and runs so for three miles.
This part of the Vermilion is known as
Coulee des Comeaux, which is very narrow
and shallow. After the Coulee des Co
meaux comes the Coulee du Bout de l'Ile,
running northerly. Coulee du Bout de l'Ile
takes its name on account of its being at the
beginning of the woods.
There died in the last century, a masta
don, whose bones were collected by a
French naturalist shortly afterward and
shipped to the Musee du Jardin des Planteurs
of Paris, but were unfortunately wrecked
and lost at sea. The only relic of the mas
tadon was a femur or leg bone that was
kept by the first Guilbeau, and used as a
pestle to bruise indigo which was then culti
vated in the Attakapas country. Buzzards,
in uncountable numbers, flocked to the spot
to feed on the mastodon's fl -sh. The In
dians then living in the country, unable to
pronounce carion crows, termed the birds
carencros; and from the spot where the
mastodon died, the river takes the name of
Carencso bayou. Carencro blayou is long,
tortuous, here and there shallow or deep; it
runs easterly, abruptly turning to the South,
and takes there the name of Bayou Tonton;
losing its name as it flows southward to take
the name of Pont des Moutons till it again
takes its official name Vermilion. All along
the river there are sceneries of indescribable
beauty; the land is rolling and hilly, cov
ered by majestic, peculiar oaks and gums.
The Vermilion has very many tributaries,
but the most important ones are the Styx
Coulee, passing through the town of Caren-.
cro, and the Iteau Bassin, emptying into a
swamp. Indian mounds are yet seen in the
woods near the banks of the bayou, and it
is not known whether or not some were ever
dug. Numerous mineral springs line the
banks of the bayou, and near by one of
these springs lay the camp tor the picnic'
The crowd had all assembled at i2 o'clock,
and a circle was formed for the young
speakers of the day. Master Valsin
Guidroz, from the Carencro school, made
the openingaddress; he begged the audience
to look upon the efforts of his schoolmates
with leniency, for, being but little boys and
girls, he hoped that their shortcomings
would fall into oblivion by the good will
they showed in trying to entertain and
amuse their friends. This was followed by
several recitations and speeches. "*The
Bad Boy," by Master Erick Guilbeau; "The
Drummer Boy of Shiloh," by Henry
Guidry; a speech, by Geo. Crouchet; Tem
perance address, b3 Jules Arcenaux; "Cher
ish Kindly Feeling," by Leon Prejean; and
speeches by Tuck Crouchet, Henry Francez,
Simon Dupuis, Victor l)upuis and Lulie
Guilbeau; all of whom are from the Caren
cro school. Special praise is deserved by
Mr. Toll, who has had these boys under his
control, and has fitted them for their ap
pearance. Then came the crowning of the
May queen, by the girls of the Carencro
school, which was conducted under the able
tutorship of Miss G. Frances. The crown
ing of the May queen was the success of the
evening. Miss Elmire Estilette made a very
dignified queen. The pretty Louisa Jones
acted the part of fairy queen with a grace
that seemed natural to her. Besides these
were Miss Laure Mangon, a sister Nymph
and twelve other Mayers. All these young
faries played their parts to the admiration of
all present and Miss Graziella Frances, who
has trained them well, deserves that success
her efforts have met with. This closed
the performance and the crowd parted to
their separate tables, where dinner was
served. The following teachers with their
respective schools were present: Mr. tH.
Toll and Miss G. Francez of the Carencro
school, Mr. T. J. Breaux of the Domingues
school, the charming Miss E. Olivier of the
Roger school, Miss M. E. Toll of the 6th
ward Cormier school, Miss B. Richard of
the 6th ward Broussard school, Mr. J. C.
Martin of the St. Charles 3rd ward school.
The picnic was quite a success and proves
the able managership of Superintendent C.
Latiolais. E. M. H.
We were treated to some exqui
site music the other day by a lady
friend who has procured a Regina
Music Box, an instrument whose
simplicity of construction is
equaled only by the melodious
sounds that it produces. It is un
like other music boxes and far
superiot to any that we have ever
seen. By merely changing the
metalic sheets, a different air is
played and with such perfect melo
dy that the hearer is almost held
spell-bound with surprise and ad
mniration. A. Wolff, of cor. 14th
street & Union Square WIV., New
York City, is agent for the Regina
SMusic Boxes.
