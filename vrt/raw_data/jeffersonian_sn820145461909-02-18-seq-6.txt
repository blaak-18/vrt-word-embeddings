Cerro Gordo, Tenn., Dec. 23, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Mr. Watson: I feel that
a few lines from me at this time will,
to some extent, be appreciated by you.
I wish I was able to give the readers
of the Jeffersonians my plan for the
next campaign. We need a confer
ence as soon as possible. We need
district committees, county, State and
national committees, and when we
have as many as twelve Populists in
a district, put out candidates, in coun
ties where we have as many as fifty
put out tickets, and in States, if wo
have as many as a thousand, we should
make an effort to build up our party
by putting out our best man for the
different offices. The people want, and
will have, some one to vote for. To
be sure, many might have to make
great sacrifices and hold forlorn hopes,
but better do this than worse. It is
nothing more than you have done.
We cannot expect our man in a
county or State to do all the financing,
educating and everything. It is too
great a burden, besides, it is not right.
Our principles are worth making great
sacrifices for. So I think we should
by all means organize, and each mem
ber should contribute and pay to the
different committees from one to
twelve dollars per year. By so doing
we would have funds sufficient to put
literature and speakers in the field,
and every advocate of our principles
should subscribe for at least one of
our publications and see that one of
his Democratic or Republican neigh
bors be supplied with one. It is a
s'hame the way we treat our best help
—the press. It hurts me so much to
think of the Missouri World failing
through just through neglect. I am
willing to be one of 2,000 to make
good Brother Dixon’s loss, and I am
also willing to be one of 500 to make
good Brother Mullins’ time and loss
of money as State Chairman, and last,
but not by any means least, we should
make good to you all your expenses
for the campaign. If the people were
educated there is not a farmer or la
boring man to be found who would
not vote with us.
We have the Farmers’ Union. You
know its shots are going wide of the
mark, because if there was no oppres
sion we do not need an organization
in the sense we have it. It would only
be for the social features. But if we
are oppressed, what brought the op
pression? and can we * remove the
cause? I contend that unjust legisla
tion is the cause of all of our trouble.
If I am corerct, then we must get re
lief by legislation. If we fail at the
ballot box, the next resort will be the
battle-field.
From my point of view there is not
a member of the Farmers’ Union who
could have consistently voted against
you, Third of November. I don’t
think the farmers need or ask only
for a square deal, and from the way
they vote they don’t seem to want
either, or we are too ignorant to know
how to get our demands.
In conclusion, I want to, to some ex
tent, prove my faith by my works.
The best proof I can make of how
jpueh I appreciate what you have and
are trying to do for the oppressed, is
the enclosed contribution.
Very truly yours in-the fight to the
end, G. H. Whitlow.
MADE HIS VOTE COUNT.
Clinton, NrY., Nov. 29, 1908.
Mr. Watson.
Dear Sir: This is Sunday night. 1
have time to tell the whole story, and
maybe I can make you remember that
1 wrote you before. I told you that I
was born and lived in England and
had never seen the inside of a school
house. I had to pick up what little I
know out of papers on the shoe bench.
Think 1 told you I am an old man.
Yes, I am old, —in March shall be 75
years old. I am glad to say I don’t
know of anything I ever did that I
can’t do today just as well as ever, —
can eat, sleep, read, remember just as
well as ever. I think I told you my
son was editor of the Schenectady
Star.
1 need not tell } )u I am not doing
much writing. My vise docs the writ
ing. All I do is a little in my shoe
business. But I want to say I did
make my vote count all I could
against Bryan and 1 am glad he was
badly beaten. I don’t write, but
maybe I read as much as any one in
the county. Papers have been my
playthings for many years. Yes, I
read as regularly as 1 eat. Have done
what little I could for reform for 32
years and must have the Magazine
and Jeffersonian even if I pay again,—
am anxious to know about it.
I wish it was so I could step into
your office once in awhile. I can sit
and talk, and some will say, This old
fellow is best posted man. on national
problems in Clinton. I see more and
more every day what cowards men
are. I don’t know what other name
to give them. But the biggest blow I
ever got was about two weeks ago.
One of the best lawyers in Utica, a
Democrat, raked his party down the
worst 1 have ever heard, and wished
his boys would go in some better par
ty, and after all he said he had not
courage to leave it. I think now that
1 ought to excuse some of the poor
ignorant fellows who still hang to
Bryan and think he will fish around
for another chance. Yours truly,
Robert Capes.
THE “DESERTER.”
(Mentioned in “Bethany.”)
Villa Rica, Ga., Feb. 1, 1909.
Hon. T. E. Watson.
My Dear Sir: I see that some one
has asked you if the shooting of the
soldier did take place in the west. I
can furnish half dozen witnesses,
men who belonged to the 30th Georgia,
and helped to form the hollow square
which is always done on such occa
sions. He belonged to 29th Georgia
and the company was from Thomas
ville, Ga. His colonel’s name was
Young. He had deserted his command
at .Savannah and went out west and
joined the cavalry, and in the battle
at Jackson, Miss., his captain saw him
and had him arrested and courtmar
tialed. No one was to blame but the
captain. All the higher officers would
TJeffersonidtt
have released him had his captain
signed his papers.
His comrades gave him the nick
name of “Old Red.” I think his
name was Chapman. Yours truly,
W. H. Nalley.
THAT IS WHY HE MADE WAR
ON THE GREENBACKS.
Our friend John R. Campbell, of
Utica, Minnesota, furnishes us the
following:
A clipping from the London Times,
1865:
“If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the last
war in that country should become in
durated down to a fixture, then that
government will furnish its money
without cost. It will pay off its debts
and be without a debt. It will have
all the money that is necessary to
carry on its trade and its commenrce.
It will become prosperous beyond
precedent in the history of the civil
ized governments of the world. The
brains and the wealth of all countries
will go to North America. That gov
ernment must be destroyed or it will
destroy every monarchy on this
globe. ’ ’
Would be pleased to see this clip
ping in the Weekly Jeffersonian with
Ihe letters from the people.

A WORD ON REFORM.
Odum, Ga., Dec. 7, 1908.
Editor Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga.
1 want to say a word through the
Jeffersonian to the followers of re
form. I have been in the fight for IS
years. Let us volunteer and resolve
ourselves into a body to do more in
the next four years than we have ever
done. Let each one of us sacrifice a
little of our time and a little of our
money. There has never been a better
time in our nation for the people to
organize. The defeat of Mr. Bryan
gives us a good territory to work in.
1 heard some of his strongest sup
porters say that if he was defeated
they would never vote the Democratic
ticket again. We have a leader that
is tried and is true. The Democratic
party is like a ship at sea without a
rudder. Now is our time to work.
Organize in every district. Let each
county call for an organization, and
call for everybody that is favorable
to the Jeffersonian principles, and let
the work begin at once. My county is
already reorganized. Let us one and
all have the courage of our forefath
ers at the breaking out of the Revolu
tionary War. Let us be like the lady
that had a husband and six sons. One
of the sons didn’t have a gun and his
mother gave him an old-fashioned pan
handle and said: “Go son, you might
get near enough to a Britisher to hit
him with that.”
The hand of oppression is lots
heavier now than it was then. Then
they fell out over tax on a few ar
ticles such as tea; now we pay a tax
on everything. They had to resort
to the bayonet. But our forefathers
left it so we can resort to the ballo>
box.
Let us wake up to our duty.
Our Representatives are no more
than the servants of the people.
When we send one to office and he
doesn’t do what we think be ought to
do, we should not keep him there al
ways. Suppose you should hire a man
to do a job of work. When you found
him not doing the work you turned
him off.
The worst, thing we have to contend
with now, in my judgment, is the
banking system. We needn’t expect
any relief as long as we vote for Na
tional Bankers. Our party furnishes
the remedy in our money plantk.
Yours for the cause until death,
C. D. Pittman.
FROM A MID-ROADER.
To the Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir and Friend: Being one
of the many old mid-roaders that sees
no signs of relief for the laboring man
in either the old Twins, I say amen to
a permanent organization of the Pop
ulist Party, and I think the sooner the
better. As far as my observation ex
tends, the vote in Mississippi was very
k. 1 was one of the managers.
made out my ticket and showed it to
crowd and remarked, “Here a,
traigit Democratic ticket.” I asked
one of the managers to let me make
. ms ticket, and he replied, “Mr.
Page, if Mr. Watson was on the Dem
ocratic ticket, I would vote for him,
but can’t vote for him on the Popu-
Ist ticket.” All the Mississippi del
egation said the same thing by their
act at the Denver Convention, and yet
those men call themselves “Demo
crats.” Anything will do so it’s head
ed Democrat. I haven’t heard a Dem
ocrat say a word about Watson’s get
ting defeated. They never say a word
about Bryan or the Democrat Party.
So I believe they think, as I think,
their party is dead, dead.
Yes, let us have a conference and
organize and go right to work.
My dear friend, I was at the New
Orleans convention Wednesday and
Thursday, but I was sick Thursday
night so I could not go out to meet
you and hear you speak. I was very
sorry that I couldn’t meet you. My
praise and best wishes for you and
the godly cause you are engaged in.

ABOUT WATERLOO.
Augusta, Ga., Dec. 29, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Yours of the 29th read
with much pleasure, for I was glad to
hear from you since the election. I.
read with intense interest your Wa
terloo for the purpose of finding fault
with it, but I could find no flaws. I
have read Gen. Wolseley’s and Victor
Hugo’s Waterloo and yours in descrip
tion and analysis is far superior to
either. By now you have found out
the ingratitude of the masses and the
futility of improving the conditions of
the political or commercial paupers.
If you will permit me to suggest that
you devote your time and talent to
History and Biography, for I consider
you the greatest of American histori
ans, far superior in your grouping of
your facts and in presenting them in a
most attractive manner than Ban
croft, Prescott, or Motley.
I remain yours sincerely,
James Barrett,
