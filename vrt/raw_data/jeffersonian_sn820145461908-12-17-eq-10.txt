Sketches from Roman History
The warfare that is being carried on
today against class legislation has
aroused a keen interest in this little
book, in which Mr. Watson deals with
the heroic land reformers of Rome,
the great slave revolt, the tribune of
the people, the brilliant leader of the
aristocrats, and other dramatic scenes
in the history of Rome.

PAPER NOT FROM WOOD PULP.
('Continued from Page Three.)
county alone in Mississippi grows
75.000 tons each season.
Roughly, it is estimated that there
are sufficient stalks grown in the
South each year to keep nearly fifteen
hundred paper mills, turning out
twenty-five tons of finished paper
each day, running on full time every
day in the year.
These stalks must be knocked down
and cleared off the land in the spring
before the crop can be planted. They
are worth very little, if anything, as
a fertilizer, the only benefit derived
in this way being in the humus af
forded by their decay, which is very
slow, and, when left on the ground
they greatly interfere with proper
cultivation. On land well prepared
and heavily fertilized, or.in the Mis
sissippi valley and Texas, where the
soil is exceedingly rich, the stalks
grow so large that it is impossible to
attempt cultivation until they are re
moved. At present, this is simply a
dead expense to the planter, and he
would undoubtely welcome gladly any
proposition that would relieve him of
this burden.
The Census of Manufactures of
1905, shows that there were seven
hundred and sixty-one paper mills
operating in the United States in that
year. Only ten of these mills (and
they the smallest ones) were south of
the Mason and Dixon line. This
same report shows that in 1905 we
imported from Canada 577,623 cords
of spruce, poplar, and other woods,
as against 369,217 in 1900; and, fur
ther, that the cost of wood was great
er in 1900 by over one hundred per
cent for every variety except domes
tic poplar, which increased 36.6 per
cent and Canadian spruce for sulphite
and soda fiber, which increased 70.6
per cent.
These percentages of increase have
undoubtedly been maintained, if not
exceeded, since this report was made,
and now, with spruce pulp costing the
Northern paper mills SIB.OO per ton,
and an unlimited supply of raw ma
terial in the South to be had for prac
tically nothing, it seems only a ques
tion of a few years until the paper
mills will follow the example of the
cotton mills of New England and
come closer to the source of supply.
The Wood Chemistry Division of
the National Forest Service at Wash
ington is experimenting at present
with corn stalks as a possible substi
tute for wood pulp for paper. The
results of the government work may
be stated briefly in the very conserva
tive language of L. F. Hawley, Ph.
D., who with Dr. H. S. Bristol is
carrying out the work:
“We have not reached such a stage
in our experimental work that we can
make any predictions, or predict a
commercial success. We do know that
we can make a certain grade sis pa
per from corn stalks. That is not
new. however. It has been known
tor a number of years and various
scientists have advanced the work to
such stages that companies have
sprung up with the avowed purpose
of putting the product on the market
in competition with paper made from
wood pulp.
“We have for a long time been
making experiments. We can make
paper out of both corn stalk cover-
Jeffersonian
ings and the pith. Pulp made from
the former can, we believe, be made
into a paper of such quality that it
can take its place as a commercial
product. We do not know as yet,
however, whether it would be com
mercially profitable, for a ton of pulp
made from corn stalks would contain
a very large percentage of the pulp
made from the pith'—an inferior
quality.
‘ 1 The pulp made from the outer
covering which is brittle on the stalk,
loses in brittleness and becomes flexi
ble. The pulp made from the inner
pith resembles a parchment paper;
having nd long fibers and being both
tough and brittle.
“From a ton of corn stalks about
forty per cent of pulp would be made
—this by the soda process. We have
not attempted to assemble any fig
ures, to get any prices, to figure on
the cost of transporting the stalks to
some central point, to learn the avail
able number of tons annually,—in
fact we have merely been making
scientific experiments for a long time
in a quiet way and we have not
progressed far enough to make any
prediction.
“If the price of wood continues to
advance as it has beefi advancing
there is a certainty that some substi
tute for wood pulp will have to be
found. We are working therefore
with corn stalks in the hopes of find
ing something that will fill that want
when wood prices become prohibi
tive. ’ ’
Chemists employed by paper manu
facturers, as well as by scientific in
stitutions and the Federal Govern
ment, have experimented in vain with
fibrous grasses and other forms of
vegetation; and as one after another
was found to be impracticable, the
determination to obtain an adequate
raw material grew stronger, for each
defeat only made further effort the
more imperative.
If the hopes of the government
chemists are realized, it is possible
that the farmers of the country may
have opened to them a new and valu
able market for a by-product; the
cost of manufacturing paper may be
cut in half; a supply of raw mate
rial practically limitless in quantity
may be assured; and, best of all, the
wholesale destruction of forests will
cease for all time.—Van Norden’s
