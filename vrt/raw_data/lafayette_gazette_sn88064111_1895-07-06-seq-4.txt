wildest and
most wickedest
back that ever run a reel or jumped a
jig anywheres in fifty miles around the
old settlement."
own Broke Leeses am eergy."
"It was back yonder in Georgy where
the Rutherford generation of people
come from, you understand, when I
got forever and eternally weaned off
from dancin and drinkin mean whisky.
It was about the time they started up
that quick and devilish old song, which
runs on with a long rigermarole about
'Hell Broke Loose in Georgy.' One
night we got a gang of us boys togeth
er, which you understand and I was
the lead dogl of the pack, and we went
off up into the hill country to a break
down dance. The dance went on reg
lar and all right so far as I can now
recollect. But in the main time we
rounded amongst us three or four
quart bottles of white whisky, and nat
urally of course I felt in duty bound to
help the boys tote the stuff. Whilst
the dance was goin on we would run a
reel and go out and nibble at the bot
tie, and then jump a jig and go out and
take another nibble.
"But it was on our return back home
that night and up there at the ole Wal
lace plantation that the weanin took
place. One of the Wallace boys was
in the gang and we stopped over down
at the quarter to have a little fun with
the niggers, you understand, in passin.
We then took and bUilt up a roarin big
fire right out in the middle of the road
and got a whole passle of nigger boys
and gals out there to have another
dance. which was powerful like a gang
of wild youngsters. By this time I had
took on jest a 1's-e-tie bit more of that
white whiskey than I could tote con
venient, and about the best that I
could do under the surroundin eoreum
ference was to take it over in a jam of
the fence, you understand, and lay
down with it. Right then the whole
entire gang struck up on "Hell Broke
Loose in Georgy," some singin, some
rappin, some pickin the banjo, some
playin the fiddle, and everybody play
in the devil it seems to me. I never
had heard that infernal song before,
you understand, and I didnt know any
thing for certain. But when the gen
eral music started up with the song a
big fat black gal got out in the open
and went to knockin the backstep and
cuttin the pigeon wing around the fire.
Tareetly I took up a burnin big fool
notion that the words of the song had
come to pass, you understand, and
hell had broke loose in Ge6rgy, and
right there on the Wallace plantation,
at that. Looks to me like I could see
reglar droves of little blue devils comin
up from the regions below and passin
out through the fire. The boys and
gals went right on with the dance, you
understand-never missed a lick nor
jumped a cog-but I could see more
devils than people, and more pitch
forks than fiddles, whilst everything
was keepin time to the fiery music and
the devilish song of "hlell Broke Loose
in Georgy."
"'Man sir, it was the most horriblest,
hair-raisin and hobgoblinest sight that
5 these old eyes were ever wont to see"
and uncle Dau'l had to stop long
enough to catch his breath and go on.

"Better set the backband beck a few
links henceforwards. Andy and not run
too deep on white ink," put in l1lev
Scroggins.
"That's what makes me tell you
what I do. 1I1ev, about usin so much
sperits of-cnts-a-fightin," says Andy.
"Till yet I have got a dim and
scatterin recollection"-U-ncle Dan'l
went on-"of sayin to myself, Dan'l
Rutherford, this mought be a very
durn good time of year for you to move
your washin out of Georgy and go
WVest. But right then I couldn't go
nowheres. I couldn't even so much
as git up and go on back home. So
finally at last I come to the conclusiou
that if hell had broke loose in Georgy
SI would have to lay low and let her
break, and what was worse and more
of it, I would have to stay right there
in a jam of the fence on the Wallae
plantation and see the show out.
"From all the general appearmente
I reckon I must of went to sleep about
that time, cause the fire went out and
that awful hell-roarin meetAin broke up.
When at last I come back to my right
mind it was broad open daylight and
I the boys all gone. The weather was
cold as blazins and the frost was on me
I like the snow on a trash pile, you un
derastand, but I was still sweaten great
drops of perspiration as big as your fist.
For two or three days after that seems
to like everything I looked at-the peo
ple, the houses, the trees, the garden
Spalins and the horse-rack-everything
Swas knockin the backstep or cuttin the

g tune of "Hell Broke Loose in Georgy"

' And from that time onwards heneefor
s wards and forevermore I was weaned
. and weaned right from dancin and
. drinkin white whisky.
Our Uncle Daniel Rutherford is now
dead and gone, you understand, and
don't have no doubts in regards to
which way he went. But if I could
live right on for a hundred years to
come I never would forget that rainy
day over at the Cros Roads, when he
told us boys as to how he felt and the
Sthings he saw the first time he ever
heard the song of "Hell Broke Loose ain
SGeorgy."

the dadblamdest most hongriest Ash
yeoa ver heard tell of I reckon perhaps.
They could smell a bucket of. minnows
or a box of Catawba worms a mile
away, and they would flutter out of the
water and up the banks lookin for feed.
If you want powerful sharp and quick '
they would gobble up your bait before
you could so much as wet your hqdk.
I didn't do any big fishin that day, you
understand, eause it was too anfernal
much trouble. I had to go off and hide
behind a tree every time in orderment
to bait my hook."
The whole crowd went off into a big
laugh as if to say they had some doubts
in the ease, and the stranger looked
like he was sorry he had spoke.
"Stand your ground, stranger, dad
blame 'em, stand your ground, put in
Andy Lucas." Don't you back and
don't you budge nary inch. The
truth is mighty and bound to win, and
by gatlins Andy Lucas aint gone no
where.. Some people jest naturally
don't know nothin Jor certain about
fish and fishin nohow. But stranger,
hit or miss, wet or dry, by seventeen
devils in one pack I am with you. cause
I have seen fish as was fish myself, you
understand. I recolleet one long, hot,
dry summer indurin of the war when
some monstrous big fish quit the river
and used up and down Deer Creek.
One mornin the hands went down into
the swamp lands and found the corn
and cotton all under water. The sky
above was clear as a bell, and the earth
for forty miles around was dry as a
powder keg. We didn't know what in
creation was the matter till we found a
most hellatious big fish, which bad
swum up the creek durin the night till
he got wedged in between the banks.
Naturally of course the creek was
dammed up and the swamp lands over
fowed. We then put the hands to
work with three or four six-mule teams
and pulled the fish out. When we cut
him open, stranger, what do you reck
on we found in that fish ? Man sir, we
found ten acres of burnt woods inside,
with old chestnut logs layin around
there which would make a hundred
rails to the butt cut. The truth is
mighty and bound to win, stranger,
and"
l But by this time the stranger had
mounted his horse, you understand, and
t put out in a swingin gallop, whilst
Andy Lucas went up head.
1 Neither "Drmwnded" Nor "eLosted."
Of all the wonders that I ever yet
have saw, the most strangest thing to
me is to see a yearlin boy pack up a few
duds and run away from home.
One day last week little Jimmy Pick
ens got huffed up about somethin or
other and run away from home. His
home folks didn't know which way he
had went nor where he was headed for,
and naturally of course it brought on a
terrible high wave of confusionment in
the settlement. Some of the women
I folks lowed he mought be drownded in
the creek or losted in the woods, but
that didn't sound much like a boy to
me.
In the main time I took partielar no
t tice that they didn't miss a meal of
I -ictuals nor lose a lick of sleep over at
the Pickens place, and his mother low
ed she reckoned when Jimnmy got good
hongry he would come up. She didn't
give herself no bir worriment in the
case, only when she went to bed at
night she would leave the back door
open and plenty of cold grub on the
bottom shelf in the r ntry.
So it turned out by-and-by that Mises
Pickens, mother like, was plum right
r about it. Late Saturday evenin Jimmy

through the woods paster, where he
found a little nigger lookin for the
v calves, which he sent him to the house

body, broad hips, short legs, thick and r
rather hard skin, \vell-covered with a i
coat of various shades of red, hite.i
roan and reddish brown in spots, and s
brindled streaks. The cows have well- f'
developed milk veins, and large, well- "
formed udders. It is claimed for them t
by Norman farmers that they are the
best dairy cows in the world, and
they unquestionably hold the lead- i
ing position among French breeds
of cattle. Tw-enty-fve to thir
ty quarts of milk a day is not
an unusual yield for a Norman cow in V
full flush, and is sometimes consider- b
ably exceeded, while 6.000 pounds
within a year is not above the average. c
It is mainly from their milk that the e
famous Camembert and Brie cheeses 0
are made. The butter, known in Paris h
under the trade name of buerre 4
d'Iagnuh commands the highest prices
at the semi-weekly auction sales of the
Halles Centrales, the great market
place of the French capital. As beef
animals Norman cattle are noted for
early maturity and great weight
rather than large net weight of
dressed carcasses. Cows which have
served their purpose in the dairy are
fattened until they attain weights of
1,200 to 1,800 pounds. Steers at ages of e
two and a half to three years weigh r
from 1,6100 to 2,000 pounds. and there e
are authentic records of Norman oxen a
which at six years of age weighed a
4,185 to .4,335 pounds. This "general r
purpose" quality is of great importance c
to the small proprietors of France, as i
r it enables them to turn to profitable I
account their "dowager" cows and a
surplus males. The beef is of good
quality, but there is a larger propor- a
tion of bone and offal than in the I
SBritish breeds of beef cattle. They e
are heavy eaters and require an abun- I
Â° dance of nutritious food. The strong- I
est claim to public favor made in be- 1
half of this breed is on the ground of I
its hardiness and freedom from all 1
tuberculous taint.. In Normandy great I
numbers of these cattle are kept in 1
thriving condition, without shelter, t
winter and summer, throughout the
t year.-American Agriculturist.
FEEDING THE C HICKS.
r How to Keep Young ilIrds Growing and
e in Good Hleslth.
A writer in the New England Home
a stead says: To push young chicks along
t and keep them in health, there is
y nothing better than boiled eggs mashed
d up, shells and all, with two or three
e times their bulk of stale bread crumbs
e or cracked crumbs thoroughly mixed.
e Mix not more than enough for one feed
of this at a time and give them only
e what they will eat readily and quickly.
o Feed stale bread soaked in milk, either
o whole, skimmed or buttermilk after the
milk has been squeezed out by the
hand. Only one feed of this should be
prepared at a time, as it will sour if
left to stand any length of time. Millet
I, seed scattered in the litter about the
y broodhouse or the short grass, plump
e wheat screenings. oats and corn ground
e together, with an equal quantity of
a bran and made into johnny cakes, are
s good for tile youngsters. After they
get to be three weeks old eracked corn
and whole wheat may form a larger
part of their diet, increasing it as they
grow older. Better results are attained
by a judicious alternation of all, day
,. by day, or feed by feed; it keeps the
n appetite sharp and they are always on
the lookout for the new surprise at
is meal time. Don't forget the pure,
Sclean water; they need that whatever
the feed. If the soil does not snpply
grit in proper shape and size it should
be furnished them; a dish of charcoal
where they can help themselves, or a
handful in the soft feed four or fivre
times a week, will prevent most of the
ordinary bowel troubles. No tonic or
Sstimulant should be needed at this age,
a but if a brood gets suddenly chilled a
" dose of some good condition powder
will help to put them on their feet

OF all our meats, mutton is the freest

Tna quicker the sheep reaches ma

Ir wool is low in price it will add

mutton is the standby.
THE cheapest food for hogs that we

BEES AND BEEHIVES.

The beehive everywhere represented
as the emblem of industry, as for in
stance in pictures on the covers of

ioned round, sugar-loaf structure made
of twisted straw; but as a matter of
fact there are very few such hives now
in use except in Germany and Austria,
and even there the modern hive Is tak
e ing their places. The modern hive is
made of boards, and is square with
some modifications in shape and style;
it is not nearly so picturesque as the
old-fashioned hive.

hives to set up on his place wommis.

Skeepers' supplies to buy them. The
dealer communicated with many bee
farmers in his search, and finally found
one hive on Long Island. The gentle
man had meanwhile found one himself,
so that he had his desire.

everything required, including bees in
