A NOISELESS BURGLAR.
BY JAMES PAYN.
OTELS are not, as a
rule, good places for
ghosts. There is too
much "to-ing and
"'fro-ing," as Le
Fanu calls it (the
best judge of the
ghostly we ever had
in the flesh), too
much jerking of
bells instead of sol
emnly ringing them,
and not a room on
popular occasions, such as the race
week, a ghost can have to himself.
On the other hand, hotels are vely
convenient for robbers, not, of course,
of the black-craped and "money-or
your-life" description, but of the quiet,
gentlemanly-looking kind, who, if they
meet the night chamberlain in the pas
sage at two in the morning, express
their satisfaction at finding somebody
who can tell them the number of their
room, which they have unhappily for
gotten. It must be a strange life,
that of pretending to be somebody else,
generally a captain very much unet
tached, and, after mastering a more or
less difficult role all day, to pass the
small hours of the night in trying
other people's doors and taking the
consequences, which may be anything
disagreeable, from the inquiry of
"who the devil's that?"' down to the
presentation of a revolver. Ills hope,
of course, is to find the gentleman he
visits, whose very names, and far more
their habits, are utterly unknown to
him, in a deep sleep, but never dream

purse and watch upon their dressing
table are at that very moment chang
ing owners.
One can hardly picture a more anx
ions life than that of the hotel thief;
more at the mercy of circumstances,
more subject to what the old stage
directions call "alarms and excur
sions," and generally less at ease in his
inn.
No reflection, however, respecting
the disconlfort of hotel thieves ever oc
curred to Aunt Deborah; like t he
French vivisectionist who was asked
whether his experiments hurt the ani
mals, she might have honestly replied
that that consideration "never entered
her mind;" she was a tender-hearted
woman, but her pity did not extend to
the class in question. They were in
fact her bete noir: her sister Susan and
herself passed a good deal of their
time in hotels, and always with the
fear of being robbed at night before
their eyes. They never went down to
the table d' hote without connecting
some innocent and respectable person
with this larcenous profession, and if a
footstep passed their door after they
had retired to rest they plunged their
heads beneath the bed clothes and
awaited the worst.
As a matter of fact, my aunts were
never robbed at a hotel (except in
the course of business by the landlord)
though they always expected to be
until last year, when-but I must let
Aunt Deb tell her own story. No one
she says, can tell what Sue and she
suffered on the occasion in question.
or can properly describe the horror of
their situation but themselves: and as
Aunt Sue, according to her sister'$ ac
count, was insensible through terror
during a part of the time, it seems
only right that Aunt Deb should be
the spokeswoman. Aunt Sue is a
sprightly young thing of fifty-two or
so, and though not "flighty" (except
as regards a desire to escape from rob
bers) is scarcely equal to deal with a
subject at once so serious and delicate
as a night alarm.
"Sue and I had two bedrooms at the
'Imperial,' but as usual, when at ho
tels, we slept together for protection,
and one was only used as my dressing
room. In this we kept the gas burn
ing, though very low, all night, and
the door open between the two rooms,
so as to avoid being in darkness. I
need not say that all the other doors
were bolted; to lock a door at an hotel
is simply to invite the robber, as with
a little instrument, such as dentists
use, he can turn the key from without;
if on the other hand you take out your
key he puts in one of his own well
oiled ones, and opens the door with
noiseless facility. Perhaps there is no
bolt, but in that case Sue and I have a
patent door fastener which sticks into
the floor, and it is practically immova
ble. It sometimes strikes me. if any
thing should happen to Sue, how very
dangerous these precautions would be
to a sound sleeper like myself, in case
of fire; but it is not limely, considering
our ages, that she will be taken first.
"Well. I had turned the gas low in
the dressing-room, and was lying
awake listening to the breathing of
sister Sue and wishing it was not quite
so loud; as a general rule I don't mind
her snoring; it is intermittent, and
might be taken by a straager for con
versation, which is so far a protec
tion, but as it happened I was not
thinking of burglars at all that night,
but ouly wanted to rget to slep. Tihen

total darkness. Socati ody fa t6e
dressing-room had put out the gas.
"I woke dear Sue asgently as I could
but she is not a good waker; in reply
to my terrified whispers she answered:
"Eh? What? Did you speak?' And
even: 'Don't pinch,' for I was driven to
that expedient, but when I had
breathed into herear what had hap
pened she was quiet enough. 'Perhaps
you turned the gas off yourself,' she
murmured. 'No,' said I, in hushed
anxiety-indeed, we were talking
under the bed clothes-'I left more
than a bead.' 'Is the dAshing-room
door bolted?' 'Yes,' I said; it was in
deed made fast by the machine, but
what was the good of that, when the
robber must be in the room; indeed it
must be worse than useless, for he
would not know how to get out again,
which would probably make him des
perate.
"'1 think,' said Sue, 'we ought to
light the candle.' It stood with the
matches at my bedside, and what she
meant, as I well knew, was that I
eught to light it. This might precipi
tate matters and was therefore a dan
gerous offiece, but somehow I accom
plished it. Upon the whole it had a
good effect upon my nerves, though
Sue was not an encouraging spectacle.
She had endeavored to take off her
nightcap, under the impression it was
a delicate thing to do in contemplation
of the visit of a stranger, and the
strings had got in a knot, at which she
was tugging convulsively. This gave
her a color, but it was not a healthy
one, and her eyes looked as though
they would have come out of her head.
However, I took the candle and tot
tered with it into the next room with
a vague idea of asking for mercy on
condition of giving the man all our
valuables and showing how to undo
the door fastener. And here the most
dreadful thing of all happened, for
just as I crossed the threshold some
body blew the candle out, and we
were left in darkness with the positive
certainty. of there being a robber
within a few feet of us. There may
have been more terrible positions in
the history of human life, but if so, I
have never heard of them.
"The tension of our minds was such
that a little more would have made
gibbering maniacs of both of us, when
a most providential affair happened.
We heard a tray rattle in the passage
without and a cry of 'Go along with
you,' which we recognized. It was
the voice of our chambermaid Mary
Ann, and addressed to our waiter who,
notwithstanding he was carrying
plates and glasses, had endeavored to
snatch a salute from her. When we
had heard the same thing before we
had been shocked as in duty bound,
but on this occasion it gave us the
most heartfelt satisfaction; for it
showed that there were honest (tf
rather disreputable) people about, and
that the household was still afoot. It
gave me courage at once, and rescued
Sue from the very brink of hysterics
A sort of desperate audacity caused ms
to see this mysterious matter out, and
the more so because the effect of this
relief was, I regret to say, to cause Sue
to entertain some doubt of anything
having happened at all. 'Are you quite
sure, my dear,' she said, 'that you left

the gas alight in the next room to be
gin with?' It was a cruel observa
tion to make, and, so to speak,
put my back up. 'Since you
don't believe it,' I replied, 'I
must give you the trouble to investi
gate the matter for yourself,' and
thereby secured her very unwilling
companionship. Again I lit the candle
and entered the drawing-room; it
looked empty enough, and going
straight to the gas lamp, I put a match
to it which caused it to flame up at
once. As I had not turned the screw
this showed of course that it had been
left alight. How ithad been put out
and how the candle had been blown
out, remained still unsolved problems.
Our nerves were, however, now tolera
bly quieted, only we turned the gas a
little on in our room 'for company," as
it were, and lay marveling at what
had happened and our own courageous
conduct. As we did so an incident
took place which explained the whole
mystery and revealed the disturber of
our peace. Suddenly we saw a great
white moth fly right at our gaslamp,
and getting beneath the glass attack
the slender flame. Had it but been a
bend of light, so resolute was the on
set, it would certainly, have extin
guished it, but as it was the poor in
sect perished by suttee. We pitied its
fate, though it had twice left us in
darkness, and given us a most terrible
half-hour. "-Chapman's iagazine.

FARMER AND PLANTER
TO GROW CORN.
It Say be Done SuereesfOally, Rain or No
Rain.
I have never known a seed that
would sprout or germinate without
some moisture; in fact. the moisture is
all that is needed to sprout seeds.
Seeds will sprout and come to the sur
face without drawing anything from
the soil but moisture and heat; then
they need something else; a new proc
ess takes place, and the new plant then
draws from the soil and atmosphere.
But after corn is well up, it can be cul
tivated with very little or no rain-ac
eording to the nature of the soil-and
then yield surprisingly. You at once
ask how it is done.
Well, it is very simple. yet it is done
upon scientific principles. Nature
makes the corn, but you must under
stand her doings, and give her the
necessary material with which to
work. The material consists of hard
bottom and plenty of loose soil. In
vestigation has proven to me that a
certain amount of moisture rises
through the earth every night. Now
when the land is broken and planted,
the moisture can not rise any higher
than to the depth to which the
ground is broken, hence, to begin
with, we must "lay off" the ground to
be planted to corn very deep with a
turning plow, and drop the corn down
on the hard ground. Cover as deep as
you please, not to exceed six inches.
Do not plow your corn until it is six
inches high, unless it becomes very
foul; then plow as deep as the ground
was broken, no deeper.
The other plowings should be fre
quent and shallow, in order to keep the
surface loose and free from weeds.
Mr. Wellborn is right, so far as corn is
concerned, at least, when he says roots
wilt not catch in loose, fresh broken
earth.
So you see what roots your corn does
have are down in the ground where the
moisture will reach them, and you have
no roots near the surface to be withered
by the scorching rays of King Sol,
thereby injuring the maturity of your
corn.
I)o not be afraid of plowing, no mat
ter if the dust covers you, so 'you do
not plow too deep. The more you plow
the more open and loose the top soil
will be, and the looser the soil the more
moisture it will absorb from the at
mosphere.
Keep weeds and grass down at all
events. It is surprising how much one
weed in or near a hill of corn will im
pede the maturity of the corn. More
especially is this the case in time of
droughts, when your crop needs all the
plant-growing elements it can get.
For the same reason that this method
makes corn in dry weather it will also
make it in wet weather: because the
roots of the corn are down on the hard
ground where these pores carry off the
surplus of water from about the roots
-no roots will appear except near the
hard ground, when corn is treated in
this manner.
D)o not plow your land too wet; bet
ter not plow at all than plow too wet
and then let the hot sun pour down
upon it.
In 1890, I cultivated four acres of a
fifty-acre field (all in corn), and made
more corn than the other forty-six
acres made. This may seem unreason
able to some, but I am responsible for
what I say, and should only be glad to
produce any amount of evidence neces
sary. My four-acre "patch" was the
wonder of the season. The other
forty-six acres were pulverized and
the corn was planted near the surface,
on a line, loose bed. Result very plain
to a thinking man. The season was
very dry and this corn "burnt up" in
the hill. Again, the same thing was
tried with like results. I never fail to
make corn if it comes up and gets fair
ly started to growing before the ground
gets dry. Many make the mistake of
plowing corn too young. If the weeds
grow faster than the corn use the
hand hoe-pretty tedious but it saves
money.-Southern Farm.
HOG CHOLERA.
Valuable Information to Raisers of Swine.
Please give symptoms and best treat
ment for hog cholera.-W. V. C., New
Berne, N. C.
Answer-The following remedies are
the best that can be procured for this
dread disease: The first is from the
United States department; the second
was sent me by a friend with an ur
gent request to publish. We would
very much like to know if the latter
accomplishes all that is claimed for it.
Some ofthe symptoms of cholera are,
short, hoarse cough, fever running at
the nose, shivering, efforts to vomit,
tottering gait and sometimes paralysis,
constipation, succeeded by diarrliea,
dark purple blotches on the skin, with
great soreness and solmectimes nlcera
tion.
Dr. Salmon, the chief of the bureau
of animal industry, has just issued a
bulletin on this subject whlich ought
to be in the hands of every hog
keeper, and can be obtained on appli
cation to the department of agricul
ture, Washington, i). C. D)r. Salmon
says that whilst no absolutely certain
cure can be found for any disease, and
certainly not for hog cholera, yet
that, as the result of a long series of
experiments, the following has been
found to be a most efficacious formlula
in most cases of this disease, and is
valuable as a preventive:
Wood charcoal, one pound; sulphur,
one pound: sodium chloridle, two
pounds: sodium bl.crbonate, two
pounds; sodium hyposulphite, two
pounds; sodium sulphate. one poulid;
antimony sulphide, one pound.
Pulverize and thoroughly mix, and
give a large tablespoonful for each 200
pounds weight of hogs once a day.
Feed on soft food, made of bran and
shipstuff, or bran and corn meal mixed
In hot water, and stir in the proper
quantity of the medicine. Animals too
sick to eat should be drenchbe with tlihc

icine, and it will run into his mouth and(
be swallowed, or take an old shoe and
cut off a small part of the toe,. so as to
make a hole through, and put this in his
mouth. He will generally commence
to chew the shoe-then pour the medi
cine into the shoe and it will find its
way slowly into the month and be
swallowed. We have drenched hogs in
this way when we could succeed in no
other way. Keep the sick hogs dry,
warm and clean, or it is very little use
giving medicine.
Dr. T. J. Dodge, of Hamilton, Ill.,
writes as follows to the Iowa Home
stead on the subject of hog cholera:
I deem it my duty to give to the pub
lie, free, my recipe for the cure of
what is termed hog cholera. I have
used this remedy for thirty-five years,
and raised hogs on my ranch in
Nebraska, and have never lost a hog.
I have experienced by placing one
well hog with a lot of sick ones, and
keeping it well by the use of this rem
edy. You will confer a great favor
upon the farmers of our Country by
publishing this recipe in full. I am
now engaged in other buSiness, and
have been for sixteen years, and am
willing to let others prosper by the
long years of experience of mine with
a remedy I discovered myself for the
cure of this dreaded disease.
The prescription and directions are
as follows:
Arsenic, one-half pound; cape aloes,
one-half pound; blue vitriol, one-fourth
pound; black antimony, one ounce
Grind and mix well the remedy before
using.
The following are the directions for
using:
i. Mick hogs in all cases to be sepa
rated from the well ones and placed in
dry pens, with only five large hogs or
eight small ones in each pen.
2. Feed nothing but dry food, but no
water, only the slop containing the
remedy, until cured.
3. When hogs refuse to eat, turn
them on their backs, and then, with a
long handled spoon, put the dry medi
cine clown their throats.
4. Dose for large hogs: One tea
spoonful three times a day for three
days; then miss one day, and repeat
amount until cured. Shoats or pigs,
one-half the amount.
5. As a preventive, one teaspoonful
once a week will keep your hogs in a
healthy condition to take on fat. Ican
place one well hog in a pen with 100
sick ones, and with this remedy keep
him well. Let no other stock but hogs
have access to this remedy, as it is to
them a deadly poison.
Dr. Dodge adds, that for many years
he sold his recipe for .5, and treated
hogs at the rate of St per head, paying
the owner 10 cents a pound for all that
died after treatment begun.-Southern
Cultivator.
Wool and Sheep.
While there has at all times been
more or less strife existing between the
breeders of wool and mutton sheep,
the man who regards the conditions
that influence the trade in wool and
mutton can not help regarding such
differences as groundless and wholly
uncalled for. It is true that the best
mutton sheep do not grow the best
wool, and equally true that the best
wool sheep do not produce the best
mutton, but these differences are not
so great in fact as they are imagined
to be. It will be found an absolute im
possibility to produce a finely-finished
mutton, with outan accompanying good
fleece, and all the advantage of rich
food as found in a well-balanced ration,
dry and moderately warm quarters,
good pure water, kindness and con
tentment, all so necessary to the pro
duction of fine mutton at a profit, will
be found of equal advantage to the
fleece. There will be good color, good
texture and good weight, and the wool
buyer will quickly recognize such a
fleece ds having been "grain fed."
On the other hand, the wool sheep,
which many now claim to possess no
other virtue, if properly handled, and
slaughtered at a reasonable age will
produce a lamb chop or leg of nmutton
good enough to meet the requirements
of the most fastidious of our lovers of
this most delicious animal food. --Farm

RESIGNED FROM THE CABINET.
High State Oicals l Who Have "fired of
Their Honor..
From the beginning of the govern
ment until 1876 there had been 207
cabinet officers appointed by the presi
dents of the United States, and of
these 77 had resigned their ol:ices.
Eight of the 27 secretaries of state had
retired from office prematurely, 12 of
the 31 secretaries of the treasury, 12
of the 40 secretaries of war. 13 of the
30 secretaries of the navy, 11 of the 27
postmasters-general, 15 of the 38 at
torneys-general, 6 of the 14 secretaries
of the interior. There was no secre
tary of agriculture before 1886, but
that office would not enter into con
sideration anyway, for no one yet has
resigned it.
Of the postmasters -general, 8 re
signed because of the death of a presi
dent. Whenever the vice-president of
the United States has succeeded to the
presidency by the president's death,
the members of the cabinet have ten
dered their resignations to give hiuir
an opportunity to select his own ad
visers. In rare cases the new presi
dent has asked some of the old cabinet
officers to remain. As a rule, he has
chosen his heads of departments from
his own political friends and advisers.
Montgomery Blair resigned the post
master-generalship in Lincoln's cabinet
because lie was not entirely in accord
with the president's policy. William
Dennison, an appointee of Lincoln, re
signed because he did not get on with
Lincoln's successor. Marshlll Jewell
went out with Secretary Bristow,
whom he had supported vigorously in
his attack on the whisky ring. It. J.
Meigs, Jr.. resigned because of failing
health, after a service of nine years.
Samuel Osgood gave up office because
the seat of federal government was
moved from New York city.
Men soon tired, as a rule, of the
labor demanded by the government,
with its accompaniment of nervous
anxiety over the distribution of offices
and the question of party policy in
little things and great. Dissatisfaction
with the drudgery of the office and its
meager rewards has led many men to
retire from cabinet positions.--llar

THE BOAST OF HEALTH.
Fancled Improvement Often ImmedlatS ýy
Precedes Death.
All doctors know that just before
death the patient often experiences
what is called a "'rally," nature making
apparently her last stand against the
symptom which we call death; and it
Is quite likely that the feeling which
induces men to boast of health is of
the same kind-an effort of nature to
protect us against the coming sickness
which the body has recognized, thii-ugh
the mind has not. The phenolneuon
occurs every day in the cases of con
sumptive patients, who brighten up
and grow hopeful just when the dis
ease is about to strike its hardest
blows, and it is quite possible that it
is more frequent than has yet been rec
ognized that the approach of fever, for
example, is signaled by an unusual con
sciousness of health.
"I have never felt so well in my life,"
says the patients, who, twenty-four
hours after, is lying prostrate, and
whose friends quote his statements as
illustrating once more the ancient and
depressing belief.
The boast had nothing to do with the
illness, but it preceded it, and nien, at
tracted by the violent contract, almost
instinctively link the two together as
in some way and to some extent cause
and effect. Next time those who heard
it, if they feel that rush of health int
their veins, will avoid boasting of it;
and the relation of the two will escape
attention. Moreover, it must not be
forgotten that boasting is of itself a
sign of weakness, either temporary or
permanent, and that, consequently,
failure follows boasting more frequent
ly than it follows silence. The perfect
driver says he is perfect just when he
is most careless, and the resulting spill
is remembered whxen the thousand and
one escapes due to the same driver's
skill and hardihood are clean forgot

CEYLON REST-HOUSES. 1.
lRoasd-Slde Accommodations for TrUsel.
ers.
The "rest-house" is a governmental
system of providing road-side accom
modations, carried in Ceylon to a high
er standard of excellence possibly than
in any of the eastern countries. En
glish occupation has everywhere been
synonymous with the development of
resources, and it has ever been rec
ognized that the first step in this direc
tion must be tile opening of roads and
their maintenance in good condition.
It was .early found that the use of the
roads by Europeans and the better
class of natives depended to a large ex
tent upon the possibility of breaking
journey at, convenient stages, especial
ly at night. In a newly-opened
up country it could not be
that suitable places for the en:
tertainment of travelers would exist
at, points where most required. and as
the natives themselves were not to be
depended upon to furnish adequateen
tertainment. the government decided
to erect and furnish rest-houses as a
part of the general road system.
T'he result in Ceylon is that through
out the island, where means of com
mInnication by roadways have been es
tablished, there are at convenient
points neat and comnfortably-furnished
stopping-places, managed by natives.
it is true, but under the close super
vision of the roadway officials who are
Europeans. Tihe rest-houses, many of
them, compare favorably with the best

tions where they are located; and not

and those for rooms, etc., become a part

rule the accommodations are limited to

is very moderate indeed, especially to
those traveling with English letters of

ABOUT POTATOES.
Somne I'ecultarities of Growth in the
Tuber.
In a western grange there was re
cently an animated discussion on the
asserted fact that there are but few
potator blossoms compared with the
nnumber seen half a score of years ago.
Many of those that open almost im
inedtiately fall off, and in some locali
ties such a thing as a potato seed is a
rarity.
It has been questioned whether the
potato bug is responsible for this state
of things, a number of farmers argu
ing that this insect had exercised some
deleterious effect on the plant and in
terfered with its blossing capabilities.
\While it is barely possible that the po
tato beetle may have had a certain
amount of influence in the matter, it is
unquestionably the fact that potato
blossoms are growving fewer every
year. nud are liable to cease almost al
together, and that for very good and
purely scientific reasons.
It is an axiom of nature that what
ever is not required is gradually elim
inated. Having apparently no use
whatever for seed and having no at
tention paid to it, the potato has evi
dently become of the opinion that itis
not worth while to waste any strength
in producing it. The entire attention
of the farmer is concentrated on the
tubler anld for this reason nature is
turning all her forces toward the
roots. In many localities potato tops
are not nearly as strong and rank
growing as they formerly were. The
whole trend of nature is usually in
one direction, and, failing to have
seed product appreciated in the po
tato, she bends her energies toward
the development ant increase of the
roots.
This is a much more plausible and
satisfactory way to account for the
disappearance of piotato-blossoms, and
is, in addition, a purely scientific one.
