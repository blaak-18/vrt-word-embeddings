their possessions. The good of
mankind has no place in their pur
poses. They come to us from Eu
rope, which they have despoiled
and made a land of princes and
paupers; where great wealth and
great poverty stand perpetually
facing each other; where hireling
armies preserve the peace and pro
tect the robbers from their vic
tims. They are rapidly bringing
this great free republic to the
same condition.
Our ancestors fled from the old
world to the new to escape the
dreadful doom which injustice had
inflicted upon them. Whither will
our children fy when the full flow
er of this hideous abomination
blossoms forth in her perfection?
Oppression peopled this new world.
Is oppression to unpeople it? Or
is our noble civilization to sink in
blood, in a blind battle of wretch
edness against power, striking
wildly and wounding itself We
stand for the preservation of hu
manity in the highest estate of
which it is capable on earth. The
good God who made the universe
and maintains it gave us this grand
continental arena for the develop
ment of man, not of a metal. Ev
ery instinct of philanthropy, every
teaching of religion, eiery im
pulse of wisdom, every dictate of
statesmanship, is with us in this
mighty struggle, and urges us for
ward to save the republic and the
human race. Insofar as the pre
cious metalsare to be usedas the
heels of our exchange of commod
ities, we insist that both metals
shall be used.
In a barst f genearous enthasi
sam and through the pangs of civil
war, we aeeomplished the entran
chisementof another race; but in
the slough of despond from which
was plucked the black man, the
black and white are now alike
struggling. Having saved others,
we have now to save ourselves.
The isnas is mightier than any
aought for in the past.
We have noblest leaders.
Our candidate for president,
Hoe. Wai. J. Bryan has proven
himself one of the great men of
the cent ry--0 not of aldl time.
The power which gave as Wash
hatoo,, Jeferson, Jackson and
Lincoln has by events almost mi
raculous brought him to the fore
moat of affars. He is more than
ma orator. Is is a praouund think
er-a logician--a born sstatesman.
He is striving to the last verge of
human endurance-ead at the risk
of his life- in a campaign which
is one prolonged and tremendous
debate, to save his couotry, Is
there an honest heart that does not
o eat to him in this geat stig
l We sea him almost alone,
ea kught Ib armor, armed cap
spie with truth and righteousness,
battir agtain the gigantic pow
er that now have posasesmo of
ithe wokl. ShM we not mstain
ialt Sha any atty pca turn
iasd we I PL a iow where he
bade d strike where he striks.

ty."
We are no less fortunate in our
candidate for vice president, Thom
as Watson. lie is fit to stand by
Mr. Bryan and hold up his hand.
A scholar, an author, an orator, a
hero, a fiery-souled son of the gal
lant south, as wise and just as he is
brave,
But do not take discouragement
from the fact that there are two
candidates for vice president in the
field, marching under Bryan's ban
ner. There will be two months
between the date of election and
the day when the electors are re
quiredl by law to cast their votes,
Surely there is wisdom enough in
the two parties that support Mr.
Bryan to adjust that complication
during the time in a manner satis
factory to all.
Brethren, some of you fear this
campaign will destroy the people's
party. We have no such appre
hension. Its principles are right,
and being right, they are immor
tal. In four years they have ta
ken possession of the Democratic
party, and on November 3 they
nill take possession of the nation.
In 1892 wa had but one million
votes. On Nov. 3, 1896, we shall
have a majority of the whole coun
try. We have not become Demo
crats, but the Democrats have, in
the broad sense of the word, be
come populists. We have not
given up our organization. We
do not propose to close the acade
my because the first class is about
to graduate with honor. As the
spirit is greater'than the flesh, so
the principles of a party will be
greater than its traditions, We
are educating Democracy now from
the inside. We shall find it easi
er to reach their conviction in all
cases by aid better than by oppo
sition. If Democracy lives up to
its pledge, the alliance, now tem
porary, may be continued. If
they do not, and the forces have
to divide, three-fourths of their
people will march off under our
standards. The battle is not over.
The People's party has yet a tre
mendous mission to perform, and
it seeks nothing that is not just
and reasonable. It must ever re
main the guiding force of the
American republic-led by the
pioneers of the great army of re
form.
In the name of God, your coun
try, your children and all the poor
and oppressed of the whole world,
we ask you not to forego this op
portunity to do good and help
mankind. Let all unworthy
thoughts perish.
The century's aloe flowers today.
The tremendous power put forth
by our opponents teaches us that
if we fail now, we may fail for
ever. We feel the pressure of the
chains upon our limbs, but they
are not yet riveted. Shall the
coming artificers have four years
more i which to finigh their work?
Shall we not strike them down now
and forever? Shall our children
bless us in our graves; or shall
they rise up in their miseries and
curse our dishonest dust?
Remember that when liberty
dies in the United States, it dies in
the whole world. This is man's
one last great opportunity.
Forget everything else and do
your whole duty.
MARION BUTLER,
Chairman Populist Committee.
If Bryan is elected we will all be
Populists.
Job work must be paid for when
delivered. There s no exccption

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 176 pages of laugh
provoking matter, and 40- full-pare
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tram p.
