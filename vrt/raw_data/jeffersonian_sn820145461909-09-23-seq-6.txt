THE PRINCIPLE IS SOUND; THE
PLAN COULD BE WORKED
OUT.
Dear Sir: —Please send me sam
ples of the Jeffersonian and agents’
supplies. I will do all I can to get
the people to read reform literature.
There is much prejudice here to
contend with. Partisanism in politics,
and sectarianism in religion seems
to be the greatest curse of the age.
1 belong to no church, but am a
dear lover of Equity, Justice and the
Golden Rule. lam tied to no party,
only that of principle; to no church,
only that of Christ, both of which
admit free thought, reason and in
vestigation.
1 have read your publications from
the first issue, and expect to read
them as long as they are published
and I’m able to read.
As a member of the Farmers’
Union who wants to see its princi
ples put into operation so as to be
beneficial to its members, I’d like
to have your opinion in regard to
the following system of business:
Deposit all surplus products of the
farm in our warehouses, have them
insured, issue checks or receipts for
two-thirds the value of all non-per
ishable produce, said checks to be
redeemable in the products of any
warehouse belonging to the associa
tion.
This would furnish the people with
sufficient medium of exchange to
transact their business until the con
sumer needed the produce. This sys
tem, when put into practice, would
kill the National Banking System,—
Congress or no Congress. While I
am aware of the fact that it takes
Congress to make a legal tender,
there is no law to prohibit people
from adopting any system of keeping
accounts in the transaction of their
business. I consider cotton a better
security for a circulating medium of
exchange than gold itself, for the
civilized world is dependent upon
cotton for clothes, but can do with
out gold. Shame upon any class of
people in possession of such a com
modity who are running around
hunting some one to finance it!
We can store our cotton in the
warehouse, fix the minimum price at
15 cents per pound, issue checks to
the amount of SSO per bale, re
deemable in gold, hold the cotton
and transact business with said
checks, and in less than twelve
months the gold will be at the ware
house to redeem the checks, or one
half of civilized humanity would be
in rags.
Let us, as soon as possible, build
our own manufactories and thereby
get the benefit of high tariff, or abol
ish it entirely. The cotton farmer
will never be entirely independent
until he is able to manufacture his
own product. He might hold his cot
ton until the spinner would give 25
cents per pound, and then the spin
ner would be master of the situation,
so far as the finished product is con
cerned, as the farmer was while
holding the raw material, and could
fix the price on cloth so as to get his
25 cents per pound back with a good
dividend on the capital invested.
Let the South make the farm self
sustaining as near as possible and it
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
will soon be able to build all facto
ries necessary to manufacture all of
its raw material.
We lose enough on one crop in
the way of freight on cotton to the
spinners, an on the cloth back to
the consumers, to build all the fac
tories necessary to work up the crop.
Let the farmer do less work and
more thinking, join the Union and
study and discuss business principles
and they will soon be one of the
most powerful organizations on
earth. Study the science of gov
ernment, read Watson’s Magazine
and weekly Jeffersonian and find out
what you need, and then tell the
fellow that’s in office what you want
and must have, or he can hunt an
other job.
I think if the preachers and mem
bers of the different churches would
quit talking, preaching and singing
so much about the sweet bye-and
bye, and do like Watson, and have
something to say of the nasty now
and-novv, there would soon be some
thing doing down here that would
cause the devil to tremble in his
boots.
In conclusion, will say that here
is a dollar for the reform cause, to
be spent as you think best.

BELIEVES HIS NEIGHBOR’S COM
MITMENT TO ASYLUM TO
BE ILLEGAL.
Dear Sir: —Having read in the
Jeffersonian so many complaints
about the cruel treatment given the
inmates at Milledgeville asylum, and
about the George Bell case, I thought
that probably the practice of send
ing sane people to the asylum would
be checked, but if one-fourth of the
rumor is true about the trial and
conviction of Dock Camp and the
sending of him to the asylum (and
I have no reason to doubt that the
reports are true) we have a case in
Floyd county equal or worse than
the George Bell case.
Mr. Camp was tried and sent off
at our last term of court just past.
Mr. Camp was sent to Milledgeville
some years back and was released in
about forty days. He is a man with
his faults, which, of course, do not
harm anyone but himself. He lived
only about half a mile from me. I
have talked with him on many oc
casions and could swear, with a
clean conscience, that he is not in
sane. Nor would anyone else in this
community swear that he is a fit
subject for the asylum, or has been
from the time he was released, un
less it was some one having a grudge
against him, or that he owned some
property which some one wanted —
then he was an easy victim.
In the fall of 1908, while attend
ing court, he lost a syrup mill. On
returning, he made some investiga
tion and found the mill, and was
proceeding to prosecute the parties
who had it, but before he could
do anything, those parties turned
around and swore out a warrant for
lunacy against him. The officer bound
him hand and foot with ropes and
carried him to court. He stood trial,
came clear, but never got his syrup
mill back, for the parties scared him
751? e TLffersoixiaft
out by threatening to have him re
arrested for lunacy. Later in the
same fall he lost some saw mill
property through fear of some
threats that were made.
The only cause for the last case
being made against him was that
he made some remarks about a mur
der case in our community. There
had been a long grudge against two
men, a Mr. Davis and a Mr. Land
rum. They met and fought a bloody
duel. Mr. Davis was killed. A few
days later Mr. Camp was in Rome,
and in talking about the case made
some remark about Davis. It hap
pened that some of Davis’ relatives
were'close by and heard them, and,
knowing Mr. Camp’s trouble before,
swore out a lunacy warrant. He
was tried before a few of the prose
cutor’s sympathizers, without a law
yer or even witnesses, although Mr.
Camp asked and insisted that he be
allowed several substantial men as
witnesses. Over the protest of Mr.
Camp’s wife and children that he
was being outrageously treated and
tried for insanity when he was sane,
he was sent off to spend the balance
of his days in the asylum. He is
now 59 years old. Mr. Camp told
the court that he would rather be
dead and in h —l rather than have
to go back to that death trap.

AGE LIMIT OF “YOUNG MEN’S
LEAGUE” TOO LOW, HE
THINKS.
Dear Sir: —I am reading both of
the Jeffersonians and can truthfully
say that the matter is all good,
though I enjoy the editorials and
the letters from the people best.
I fell in love with Populism when
only a boy, fifteen years ago, and
when it seemed that the cause was
hopelessly lost. My first boy was
born, and I determined that his
name should be Watson, —sincerely
hoping that he would grow up and
honor the name of the great re
former.
Now, Mr. Watson, I have read
an article in the weekly Jeffersonian
of September 9th, on page 5, about
founding a party on the principles
of Initiative, Referendum and Re
call, and I heartily agree with it.
If all the reform forces can’t be
united on those principles, it is cer
tain that they will never unite on
anything. All honest men that be
lieve the people to be able to gov
ern themselves would be with us, and
I believe there are enough of such
people to rout the dishonest ones.
If I didn’t think that, I would be
lieve the devil had more power than
God.
I disagree with Will H. Stan
ford where he would debar men over
21 years of age from the Young
Men’s League. As a rule, boys un
der 21 years old are thinking too
much of baseball and the present
time generally to get them interested
in things political, or of the future
generations. There are hundreds of
housands of men between the ages
jf 21 and 35 who are willing to
take an active interest in the reform
movement, and if organized, we
would cause somebody to sit up and
take notice.
Give us Initiative and Referen
dum. JOEL R. GERMAN. .

FROM A TENNESSEE BOY
I wish to write you a personal let
ter in regard to my attitude toward
you, without any acquaintance with
you at all. This may seem some
what pert in me, but I will trust it
to you to accept my apology for so
doing.
I am a poor boy, only nineteen
years of age. I have been an or
phan since I was eleven years old.
My parents being very poor, have
made things hard for me in getting
an education, —and I haven’t got but
little. What I have learned has
been during spare hours while work
ing as a laborer on the farm, and
that is the way I am educating my
self now. I was raised with (that is,
the people with whom I have been
associated mostly) staunch Demo
crats. Well, I am a Democrat in
the sense of the word and not the
name. I am a Democrat in the
sense that it means a government for
the people and by the people, and I
want to assure you that when I am
old enough, you shall have my vote
any time you are a candidate, and
I can vote for you.
I keenly appreciate your articles on
the Foreign Missions question, and
agree with you fully in every detail.
I now borrow your magazine from
a friend to read the articles, and I
want to assure you that as soon as
I am financially able I shall sub
scribe for it. I have to help ,my
younger sisters and brothers with
my small earnings now, but maybe
God will help me in this as he has
in many other things.
I am making the effort of my life
to rise above my present position
in life, not because I feel that I am
worthy of anything higher, but be
cause I feel that there is a work for
me in which I can be of a greater
service to my fellow man.
May God bless you in the great
fight you are making for right, and
I pray that you may live to see the
day when victory will greet you in
your battle against the great evils
of our government. I am proud to
know that I am a citizen of a gov
ernment that has in it a man like
you.
Hoping that you will pardon me
for being so bold as to write you in
this manner, I am,
Yours sincerely,
HUGH RAY NOLEN.
Ed. note: —Glad to hear from you,
my boy. Don’t worry about being
poor. If you’ve got the right kind
of grit, poverty cannot keep you
down. No man is whipped until he
himself loses heart. Good success to
you.—T. E. W.)
THEY WILL BE IN BOOK FORM.
Dear Mr. Watson: —Have read all
your articles on Foreign Missions up
to and including September maga
zine. If I were Miss Houston I
