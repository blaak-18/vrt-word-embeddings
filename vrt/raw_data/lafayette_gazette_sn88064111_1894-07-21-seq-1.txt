THE SINGER'S TRIUMPH.
"The greatest triumph of my life?"
The singer softly said,
" 'Twas in a city hospital,
Beside a fair girl's bed.
They called her 'Sister Madellne.
An orphan and alone. "
And 'Mother, sing! oh. mother, singa'
Was her unending moan.
"The cruel flame had-spared her face,
'Twas heavenly to see.
I took her ice-cold hand in mine,
And sang to old 'Dundee:'
" 'Father, whate'er of earthly bliss
Thy sovereign will denles.
Accepted at Thy throne of grace
Let this petition rise.'
" The moaning ceased. up into mine
. She lifted eyes that shone
With something more than mortal love.
Or beauty's light, alone.
" I sang of Heaven's perfect rest.
Of Christ. 'the dying Lamb.'
SAnd 'Rise. my soul, and stretch thy wings.'
To dear old 'Amsterdam.'
"' Then 'Jesus. lover of my so
The fluttering fingers led
The tender cadence of thoe
'0O singer sweet?' she said.
" Then. kneeling there. 1 chanted low
The 'Gloria'-my eyes
Were closed, and as a dreamer sees.
So I saw Paradise.
" I knew that death was coming fast.
And kissed her tenderly.
The smile her lingering spirit ga-re
Was Triumph's height to me."

THE WRONG MAN.
A Case Where the Joke Was on
the Joker.
"It was this way," prefaced the old
sailor, filling his pipe. lie struck a
match, took a pull or two, and then
gave the following story:
"I'd been off in the little trader
Nydia-Cap'n Mark HIazard-on a tral
ing run to the Sandwich iý-lands.
"We came into port one fine morn
ing, inloaded our cargo, and the ves
sel having to go into dry dock most of
her crew, me included, had nothling to
do but stroll about and spend our
money.
"One afternoon when we were loung
Ing about a trim shaurp-eyed young fel
low in a long coat passed us on his. way
uptown.
"He had on his arm the sweetest
faced young girl I ever set my eyes on.
"She wasn't more'n eighteen, her
hair was like gold and she was as trim
as a yacht.
"Well, I hadn'ta thoughtof any of us
seeing each other again, and I don't
think Bob thought anything at all
about it; but an hour later the same
sharp-eyed young fellow who had been
the young girl's companion came up to
us and passed a word or so about the
weather.
"'When do you sail and for what
place?' he asked, after a little time, ad
dressing his talk to Bob.
" 'We're out of a berth,' said Bob.
"The young fellow was going to leave
us when Bob said that, only a man
standing close by us turned out to be
a skipper short of hands, and we
signed with him for a whaling voyage
to the Windward islands-lie coming
over to us when he heard Bob say we
wasn't hired, and hiring us then and
there.
"His schooner, the Nancy, he said,
was lying three piers down the west
ward and was to pull out at about
three o'clock in the morning.
"The young fellow asked us to go
along with him when things were set
tied.
"'What tack are you drivin' at, any
way?' Bob asked when we had stopped
in a quiet doorway; 'speak up, for
we're your men.'
"'Well, it's this,' the sharp-eyed
young fellow said. 'I want to play a
joke on a friend of mine, and you two
will be paid for helping me.'
"'Orders?" said Bob.
"'At about half-past twelve o'clock
to-night come up to --,' and he gave
us the name of a boarding-house that I
forget the name of, 'and go up to the
hecond floor. The man I want you to
take on the cruise with you is in room
82, at about the head of the stairs.
Go in quietly, chloroform hlii and
take him downstirs to a hack I'll have
waiting in front of the house. And-'
"'Enough said,' Bob interrupted.
'I've done the thing before. Smuggle
him abroad, and when he gets his
senses back he won't know who
brought him there and we won't be
likely to tell him.'
"'How about the pay for the job?'
Bob wanted to know.
"'I'll-give the hackman five dollars
to give each of you when he sees you've
done the thing,' said he.
"'That's agreeable," said Bob. 'liow
can we get into his room-the fellow's
you want to joke?'
" "It just so happens that the lock to
his door has been broken for the last
week and he has been unable to faste
it,' said the young, sharp-eyed fellow
'We're in luck, you see.'
"It turned out afterward that he
his name was Fink Campbell-was in
love with the pretty, sweet-faced girl
we'd seen him with.
"Her name was Elsa Horton, or I
make a mistake.
"And she was in love with the chap
this Campbell hired us to kidnap-a
handsome, manly young fellow, whose
name was Fred Kingsley, and who,
loved her for her sweet face and not
for the money her old father was said
to have, the way young Campbell did.
"Then he got her-she and young
Kingaley, it seemed, were to be married
in a few days-to say, without think
lng, that if Fred I~ingslqy didn't appear
when it was time for the wedding she'd
marry him--as girls talk sometimes,
you know.
"Then he must have begun to scheme
how to get Frank Kingsley out of the
way, or perhaps he had the scheme all
made up at flart.
"Bob and I bought a new fit-out, and
took otn bags aboard the Nancy.
"Then bout twelve-o'clock or a lit
tlq after;. weo struck out for the board

visit.

and It had Fred Kingsley's name at the
bottom of it, and said as how he was
sorry, but he had a wife somewhere
and he was going off to see her.
"The upper hall was not so very
dark, we found, when we got up to it.
"Bob went around and looked at the
numbers on the doors, and I waited
until he beckoned to me to join him.
"'lie's asleep,' said Bob, with a jerk
of his head toward the door.
"It was a bit darker than the hall,
but we could make out our man sleep
ing on the bed.
"Bob took the chloroform and fixed
the cloth with it on, where the young
fellow had to breathe it.
"A policeman was coming down the
street when we got to the door,-but
the cabman saw him and gave us the
word not to come out for a bit.
"W'e wasn't bothered again, and we
got our fellow aboard the Nancy all
quiet and peaceable, and then the cab
bie gave us the money and was off.
"Then on deck we went, and the
Nancy sailed at three, just as tile cap
tain had said she was going to, run
ning out with the tide.
"'There's a stowaway below in the
fo'castle!' some one sang up from there
when we were in a nice offing, and Bob
looked at me and winked.
"The mate dived below and came up
again with the seasickest looking fel
low in tow I ever see.
"The fellow's legs were like a shoe
string. and his face was white as a new
topgallant sail.
"Would you believe it, but we'd not
only shhanghaied the wrong fellow,
but shanghaied the one that had hired
us to do the shanghaing, and it was
too late to get back and do the job over
again.
W"hen young Campbell got well
enough to talk he gave us a piece of
his mind and he tried to get tile cap
tain to put rack with him, bhilt that
wasn't no use and he had to take the
eight months' run with us-not much
fun for a masher like him, I can tell
you.
"It turned out that. the way we
came to make the mistake washecau.se
lihe and young Kingsley roomed in the
same boarding house. and one's room
was No. 32 and the other's room was623.
"lob got the numbers turned
round, and we'd gone to 23 instead
of 32.
"And when we got back in port, :f
there wasn't a bit of news!
"Young Campbell's disappearance
had caused an examination of the
books Ihe was keeping in the same
warehouse, and it was found out that
he had been stealing from tile firm.
"'lie hadn't been on shore three
hours before the police had him locked
up.
-P"'The young fellow had proved that
he was straight as a gunbarrel to
every one's satisfaction, and in an
old paper, dated about when the Nancy
was two months out of port, was a no
tice of Fred Kingsley's and Elsie I-or
ton's wedding."-Boston Globe.
FREAKS OF FIGURES.
The Terms "Dozen" and "Thousand"
arsve Several Interprotsatons.
If an ordinary business man was
asked to state how much is one hun
tired and one dozen he would most
likely reply, without any hesitation,
one thousand two hundred and twelve
(1.212). lie might, without violating
the customs of the country, put the
figures at 1,085 or 1.335. A dozen is
commonly supposed to be twelve single
things, says the Great Divide. A
baker's dozen is thirteen. A dozen of
cotton yarn is just one "hank" conm
poucd of twelve "cuts." A dozen of
fi:;h in some localities is twenty-six,
and n dozen of pottery inl the whollesale
trade may mean two or it may mncan
fifty pieces, not depending on the nc
tual number of pieces, but on the size,
weight, etc., of the jugs. bowls, plates,
etc.
A printer's 1,000 is only 1i10. Iut it
takes 1.'00 staves to make 1.000 in
nine siz's that are' made for extort.
In many of the trades, the terml;
"dozen," "hundred" and "thousand"
do not bear their literal English mean
ing. but a technical one peculiar to
each trade, as in stone wo-rk., latih,
shnigles anul cotton yarns. This tech
nical perversion of plain English ex
tends to most of our weights and meas
ures. Thus a gallon may be 231 cubic
inches or it may be 20.3. In the school
arithmetics four quarts make a gallon,
eight gallons make a bushel, but in
practice it takes forty quarts to make
a bushel of corn, beans, etc. That
is because only the liquid mneas- I
ure quart cup (231 cubic incises to the
gallon) is in use, while the dry-measure
gallon contains 205 cubic inches.
Action of Light on Water Colors.
Collectorsof watercolors"tvill do well
to take note of some experiments made
in England on the action of light in
the weakening and dispersion of the
coloring matter in pictures. It was
found that the sulphides, cadmium,
trisulphide of arsenic and indigo are
prone to fade from oxidation, due to
hum1dity, air and light. Of these cal
mium is especially sensitive to the in
finenc of moisture, and will fade in a
fortnight in damp air: trisulphide of
arsenic is also seriously affected by
damp air, but indigo, while suffering
from moisture, shows no signs of de
terioration when exposed to dry air or
an atmosphere of carbonic acid. Cer
tain colors are affected only by light.
Of these, Prussian blue, which fades
in carbonic acid as well as in light, re
sumes its former color in darkness and
pure air. ThIe combined action of light
and dry or damp air speedily decolorizes
the lakes, vermillion and Naples yel
low, but causes no modification in co
balt red, Indian red, yellow ochre and
sienna. The tests go to prove that!,

THE JAVANESE BAT.
Trbe ig Fruit Took Wings and Flew
Away.
On the island of Java there are so
many wonderful things that one is
never astonished at anything, only curl- I
ens to find out all one can about all that
is new and strange.
A traveler was struck, the morning
after his arrival, by the odd appearance
of a.fig tree. It seemed to be loaded
with a very large and dark fruit, hang
ing, not singly or in clusters, but in
rows as closely as figs are packed in a
box for transportation, from the lower
sides of all its branches, filling them
trunk to tip.
The traveler intended to ask his host
about this new sort of fig, but darkness
fell before he had had opportunity to
do so. There are no long twilights in
the tropics, but night follows quickly
upon day. So, almost as soon -as the
sun was below the horizon our traveler
was bewildered by seeing the fruit of
the fig tree apparently begin to pluck
itself, while the air was fanned by a
multitude of softly-flapping wings.
The queer-looking fruit was, in fact,
no fruit, but an immense colony of the
great Javanese bat known as the ka
long. During the daylight the bats
hang suspended, heads downward, by
their hind claws, but when the night
comes they start out upon their flights
in quest of food. The kalong is detest
ed by the inhabitants of Java because
one of the bats will devour or otherwise
destroy in one night fruit enough to be
a week's supply for food for a hungry
man, and this is a matter of importance,
even in so fruitful a land as Java. Ac
cordingly bat-hunting, though not an
exciting, is a favorite amusement for
moonlight nights. The slow, steady
flight of the kalong is watched until it
descends upon a fruit tree. and then a
discharge of small shot will bring it to
the ground. When its wings are spread
the kalong measures about five and a
half feet from tip to tip, while its head
and body are more than a foot in length.

EGGS AND MATRIMONY.
How tile Countrylman Traded His Hen
Fruit for Ia Lieense,
A long-haired young countryman,
with his trousers three inches from his
boots, and his boots three miles from a
shine, passed into the office where mar
riage licenses are kept on tap with a
basket on his arm.
"Good mornin'." he said to the clerk,
"can I git a marriage license here?"
"This is the place," replied the clerk.
"Well, I've got six dozen eggs in this
here basket; can I get one for them?"
"Hardly, I guess."
"Well, I don't know nothin' about the
price of eggs nor marriage licenses, but
I'm willin' to put up the eggs fer the
license, sight unseen."
"Can't do it." insisted the clerk. "We
are not in the business of trading mar
riage licenses for eggs."
- "They're fresh," suggested the appli
cant, in a half pleading tone.
"So in the license." argued the clerk.
"What's one worth," asked the youth.
going off on another tack.
"A dollar."
"W hat's eggs wutt?"
"'Seventeen cents a dozen. Why
don't you. go and sell your eggs and
come back here with your money?"
The egg-vendor picked un a pen and
a pibce of paper and began figuring.
"''By crackey." he said, after a. minute
or two. "that's what I'll do. The eggs
is wuth one dollar and two cents, and
I'll have enough left after payin' fer
the license to git a postage stamp and
write to Susan to let her know the
weddin' needn't be postponed owin' to

control," and he hurried buoyantly out
of the otlice. with the eggs fairly jin

SPANISH THEATERS.
Even the Bables iLove the Drama in 4SpetI
In no other country is the theater as
popular as in Spain. After a bullfight,
the Spaniard loves the theater best. A
true Spanish home is so dull that Span
ish men and women alike scarcely ever
spend a quiet evening in their inner
circle. It is not to be wondered at,
therefore, that they should prefer to
leave their uncomfortable rooms to get
warmed and dazzled for a few hours in
the glare of the teatro. It is there,
also, they see their friends, and con
tinue their habitual tertulia or gossip.
Even the children love the drama, play
or sainete, and on Sunday afternoons
and feast days their manmmas deck
them' up in finery and take them
to see the latest scnsational, play
It is curious, indeed, to watch a box
full of baby faces keenly interested and
devouring a terrible drama full of bar- I
rowing scenes, or laughing at a short
play full of wit and piquant jokes. It
does not seem at all natural to see chil- !
dren taken to these spectacles, but'
Spanish children are little old men and
women, and a fairy pantomime would
be too dull for them.
In Madrid there are almost as many
theaters as churches.° They are very
commodious. splendidly decorated, and
all built after the same model. A large
stage, a pit full of cozy red velvet buta
eas, or stalls, where ladies and gen
tlemen sit together, and round the
house the palcos, or boxes, large and
airy, with looking glasses, chairs and
carpets. Above the tiers of boxes is
the paraiso, paradise, or cheap gal
lery, which derives its name from its
vicinity to the sky. The Madrid opera
house is perhaps smaller than the
Grand opera house or Covent garden,
but is by far more convenient. It re
minds one of a dainty ladies' boudoir,
it is so fresh and bright with its red
and gold decorations, and pretty fres
coes. The royal box itself is a gem,
with capetonnel walls and the arms of
Spain above the red and gold curtain.
This is the only small royal box, as the
queen never uses the immense one that
occupies the center of the house. except
on very grand occasions. Behind the
queen's box is -a pretty saloon, where
she can retire to take refreshment.s be
tween the acts. There is a telephone
there, and it was through it that her
majesty received the news of Mont
pensier's death one night when the
opera was going on. - Philadelphia

RAPID BREATHING.
]low Invalids May Obtain Some of the
Good Rffects of Exercise.
About fifteen years ago Maj.-Gen.
Drayson, of the British army. often
suffered, especially at night. from a
severe pain in the region of the heart.
He believed he was doomed to die soon
of heart disease.- About that time cer
tain of his experiences in the mountains
of India led him to believe that his
heart pain might be due to insufficient
oxygenation of the blood. lie, there-{
fore. tried to relieve it by breathing
rapidly-at the rate of about forty
breaths a minute. In a few seconds the
pain ceased and did not return that
night.
After that, he says. he always resort
ed to the same expedient, and invaria
bly with success. As time went on the
pain became not only less frequent, but
less .seyere. and now. if there is the
slightest indication of it. rapid breath
ing prevents its arrival at maturity.
He thereupon brings forward many
instances in support of his belief that
some of the advantages of moderate ex
ercise are to be gained by simply breath
ing rapidly. Rapid breathing is an ef
fect of exercise, and this is beneficial
because the rapid breathing gives the
blood plenty of oxygen.
Invalids or others who can not take
exercise can obtain some of its good
effects by deliberately passing much
pure air through the lungs. Rapid
breathing is particularly helpful in
cases of sleeplessness and restlessness
The air must of course be pure. else
rapid breathing can hatve no good
effects. Hundreds of thousands attri
bute disease to themselves when noth
ing is wrong except their habit of
breathing air impure from tobacco,
smoke. gas-burning. or simply from a
lack of ventilation.
Impure air makes impure blood and
impure flesh. Thus those -who consume
such air fall quickly into and before
disease. They can not endure an open
window or door because they feel cold.
this sense of coldness being in many
cases simply a symptom that the blood
has been vitiated by the breathing of
poisonous air.
To breathe air laden with human ex
halations is not a vwhit more sensible,
as Gen. Drayson observes, than to drink
liquld sewage for a beverage.-Youth's
Companion. -
Benefits of Education.
Education does two things for the
household-it gives a certain amount of
information that is of direct service
and it gives a training that is of indi
rect but even greater value. The in
formation immediately gained comes
through the study of art. chemistry,
economics, physiology and psychlogy.
The study of art should enable the
housekeeper to build and furnish her
house with taste: of chemistry. to pro
vide for its sanitary construction and
for the proper preparation of all food
materials; of physiology, to study the
physical development of her children:
and of psychology, to observe their
mental growth and base her training
upon it. If tihis were all it might be
said that for a young woman contem
plating the care of a household the best
possible preparation would be a four
years' college course.-Chicago News.

DRESS ITEMS.
A Few Timely Hints and Suggestions to
Feminine Readers.
Plaids are coming in again. Fine lit
tie checks, with green. yellow and black'
combined, are the favorite mixture in
taffeta silk.
Cotton crepon is a desirable material
for summer gowns. and it can be had in
black and all the light tints. It is es-!
pecially recommended for its laundry
qualifications. as it washes perfectly
and requires no ironing.
Colored stones were never more used.
Large oval blocks of acquamarine and
smoked topaz are preferred. These are
set in the high tiaras. in decorations
for bodices, in girdles, sumptuously set
with diamonds and gold and silver.
In London, this spring, young ma
trons are wearing small toques, the
foundation being formed of four small
shells of fancy straw. Cowslips or
violets trim the tiny toque at the
back, while at the front are upright
hows of satin or moire ribbon passed
through jet rings. A few exclusive
milliners have imported these shell
shaped toques.
Black stockings remain in favor,
whether of silk, lisle thread or balbrig
gan. Their chief rival is tan-colored
hosiery, which is most often chosen to
match suede ties or slippers, though
with these black is also permissible,.
With evening toilets stockings match
the slippers, which are of the material
of the dress or else of satin, moire sr
suede of the same color.-Phlladelphia

A PICTURE OF SLAVERY;
RegreM s I a South Carolina City Just Ne
fore the War.
It was with a curious interest that
we studied the buildings and customs
of the town. so different in cery way
from those of our northern homes. The
long, airy houses with their three
stories of piazza. the negro quarters in
the yards. often much larger and more
imposing than the dwelling of the mas
ter and mistress, swarming with happy
and careless life. as.the many servants
passed to and fro between house and
quarters: and the little darkies of all
ages were free to play and tumble to
their hearts' content, unless, indeed, a
sweet-voiced call came from the rear of
the piazza: ''George Washington and
Columbus, come notice Miss Elvira!"
followed by the rush of perhaps half a
dozen small darkies of varying ages,
all eager to play with and care
for the heiress of the house and of
them. Arid the loving and reverent
care which they did take of the little
Elvira was beautiful to see: Then the
long stretch of the yard. with its pump
in the middle, where a buxom serving
maid was filling her pails of water,
which came into the house afterwards,
one poised on her stately head. while
she carried two in her hands: the queer
wooden shutters, and the bewildering
arrangement of the numbers of the
houses on the street. where it was said
that every citizen, if he moved, carried
his number with him as a part of his
personal property: the inevitable negro
everywhere, waiting on and serving us
at every turn: the beautiful gardens,
whose high gates opened mysteriously
and swiftl34 by invisible hands at
the appeal of the loud-echoing
bell. WVhile cone negro led us
up the path. another opened
the front door, a third escorted us to
the drawing-room. wvhile a fourth an
nounced our arrival to the gracious
mistress, and a fifth chubby little girl
or boy appeared before we were fairly
seated with a tray of cooling drink!
And the procession of servants from the
kitchen when dinner was in course of
serving, one servant for each dish, so
that everything was smoking hot,
though it had come some distance in
the open air! The queer and fascinat
ing dialect of the negroes, and the alto
gether fascinating accent of the
Charlestonians, the flare of the live
sighlike breath of the pitch-pine knots
in the fireplace em the evening or the
early morning, when the servant who
came to make our fire entertained
us all the time of he-r stay
by her remarks, and never quit
ted the room-which she did half a
dozen times during the process-l ea vi g
us in doubt as to what her crrand might
be, but announcing encouragingly each
time. as she opened the door and disap
peared, "Now I'm going for tlhe
matches," "Now I'm going for to fetch
the dust-pan." etc. All was new atnd
full of interest and suggestion.
The regulations under which it was
considered necessary to keep the col
ored population were to us new and in
teresting. The law at that time for
bade their being taught to read. A
colored woman could not wear a veil in
the street, nor were two negroes al
lowed to walk arm-in-arm except at
funerals. A curious and. suggestive
thing happened, therefore. Every
negro funeral was largely attended,
and the corpse was sure to be fol
lowed to the grave by an impos
ing line of mourners, all walking arm
in-arm. One very marked figure in the
city was the old man at the ladies' en
trance of the Charleston hotel. I think
I have never seen a man who had more
the appearance of being somebody's
grandfather than this kindly old Mar
cus. One day he had'disappeared. and
there was no one at the door. After
long and futile search for him a mes
senger brought word that he wanted
the loan of money in order to return,
and the mystery was finally solved by
the discovery that he could not come,
not because he had bought either oxen
or land. or married a wife. but for the
simple reason that, having become more
than specially interested in his one
only pastime of gambling the night
before, he had, in a fit of noble rage
at his persistent ill-luck, rashly
hazarded his clothes-and lost the
game. A contribution from his friends
at the hotel soon restored him. clothed
and in his right mind, which was a very
positive one. There is a tradition cur
rent that one evening, as a party of
lately arrived northerners were having
a pleasant conversation in the parlor
somewhat late, they were surprised by
the appearance of Marers, who gravely
informed thenm that he had come to
sweep the parlors, and that "our folks
in dis house always goes to bed by half
past ten, sah!" The intimation was
humbly heeded. Of course no one
could resist the law of the hotel when
the decisions were handed down from
such a height.-Anna C. Blrackett. in
Harper's Magazine.
Spanish l'rlde.
Pride is the birthright of almost every
Spaniard, and the fact that one of the
race may take up the occupation of a
beggar does not shut him out from the
possession of it. An American truiveler
relates that, in alighting at a hotel in
Granada, he saw a man at the door put
out his hand toward him.
The traveler supposed that the man
was the porter of the hotel. and offered
him his valise. The man stepped back,
tossed his head, and frowned scorn
fully.
'Caramba.'" he exclaimed. "Do you
tlike me for a porter? T would have
you understand that I am no porter."
"Indeed? Then may I ask you,
senor, what you are?"
"I am a beggar. sir. and ask for your
alms!"-Youth's Companion.
