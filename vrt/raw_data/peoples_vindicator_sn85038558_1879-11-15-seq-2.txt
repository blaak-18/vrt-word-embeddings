Attentlon Greeabaekers.
We take pleasure In calling special
attention of all Oreenbaekers to the
following resolutions of the Greec
Seback Convention in the parish of
Red River. These gentlemen bave
N* set an example worthy of imitation
by all men of that plitichal complex
ion throughout L:mis:ina. They
have sense enough to see that the
Radical party is the most bitter and
uncompromisingenemy to the Green
back party on esrth. They know
that their ideas of finance will never
be adopted so long as the Radicals
are in power. The first thing for
Oreenbacklers to do is to defeat the
party that issued the Bonds. This
can only be done by a cordial and
energetic co-operation with the Dem
ooratle party. Does any member of
the Greenback party hope to gather
recruits from the Republican ranks?
Surely, none are so foolish. Theyare
preemlanently the party of the bond
holders, hard-moneyand a high pro.
teotive tariff.
These mighty interests are all en
listed in, and working together for
the success of Republicanism and
against the people. They were nev.
, er more united; never showed a
bolder front, nor were ever more de
termined to conquer than at present.
The recent elections North show
moeet clearly that they are utterly
impervious to the Greenback or soft.
money idea. It makes no more im
preseion upon their organization
I than a blister plaster upon a wooden
leg. They are determined to enjoy
the advantages and reap the fruits of
the accursed class legislation which
now disgraces our National Statutes,
as long as possible. Come friends,
Greenbackers, there is our common
enemy, there is the mighty Goliath
of Oath, that will require our united
strength to overthrow. Let us all
work together and save our beloved
Loulslana from being again tram.

Open Aetter to a GJreenback Friend.
at NATCHITOCIEs, LA., NOV. let, 1879.
Mve PAn FRIEND:
SHving just been Informed that
of you, an old veteran In the Democrat
re ic ranks, have to some extent been
p captivated by the Greenback heresy.
I hasten to express my surprise and
' sorrow at such Information.
,v I have some apprehension that I
1e may be running the risk of offending
d you but I 'rust you will take this let
ter in the spirit t s nlatended, which
o" Is prompted solely by the interest I
w feel in you, and Is dictated altogether
Dr by a spirit of kindness. I have so
is much respect for your good sense and
judgment that I am satisfied you
)r have not posted yourself in, nor re
it lected upon the wild schemes of this
s party, and I am firmly persuaded
that if I could have one hours talk
id with you I could convince you of the
I- grave error of giving this party any
tf countenance whatever.
In the first place; the recent elec
"r tions have demonstrated beyond a
1? remnant of a doubt that the people
re of these United States will not have
i. any other kind ot money than gold
and silver, and paper money. which
represents Into value gold and silver.
because redeemable at pleasure in
i. these metals. We take greenbacks
o and National bank bills at present,
as readily as we receive gold and sil
ver, because the faith of the Govern
t* ment is pledged for their ultimate
a redemption which causes them to
. represent, and to be worth to us,
while we hold them, and to the per
t son to whom we pass them, so much
w of that kind of money.
ty That kind of money the people of
this country have been used to since
the establishment of our Govern
ment, and I repeat, that the recent
a elections have demonstrated that
n they will have no other. Consequent
ly the Greenback party, as a Nation
y al party, is henceforth as dead as
was the Know--Nothing party after
b the election of Henry A. Wise
* In Virginia, In 1854. So the most the
party can ever become will be a mere
faction, and that only, to this State,
in a few parishes.
h My friend, you have enlisted after
d the army has been routed and dis.
troyed.
But their doctrines are, in
d themselves, so wild and pernicious,
1. and especially so, to the South, which
is the wealth producing portion of
or the Union. that I am sure you have
not thoroughly examined them.
Their clap-trap cry is "more money
for the people." But have the lead
ers here explained what kind of
e money theirs would be ?
It will be impossible within the
compass of a letter to fully elucidate
this subject, but a statement of a few
'r salient facts will suffice, I think, to
i- convince you that their "people's
d money" will wholly fall for all pur.
e poses of trade and become at once
o utterly valueless.
Do you know; have you been in
* formed, that this party propose to
flood this country with more than
Three Thousand Millions dollars of
paper currency. This amount being
' about sall times as much currency as
the demands of the business of the
country require, you will perceive
" that by the laws of demand and sup
ply, which govern money as well as
all other commodities, their Green.
back dollars would be worth only
" about 17 cents each, i. e. It would
B take six of their dollars to make the
' present value of a onedollar National
I Bank Note. And this only provided,
their dollars were to be redeemed in
some way, and at some time or other.
* But Is not the intelligent business
man appalled and confounded when
t he Ils further Informed that every
dollar of this Three Thousand Mil
lions of currency is to be. and remain
wholly, and forever irredeemable.
Doyou not at once ask, what lsa to be i
the basis, of such a currency as this ?
- This question was asked and answer
t returued io Pomeroy's Democrat of
' October 25thb, 1879.
"What shall Greenbacks be based
C on ?"
"William McMillan writes from
Zanesville, Ind., saying that some
one there had asked him what
Greenbacks would be based on. He
r It turn, asks the question of the
Democrat. They shall be based on
the same thing that the United States 1
"'otaige Stamp. shall be based upon.
The law of this country declares that 1
the postage stamr, is a legal tender
for the carrying o(f a letter. The law I
of this countryv declares that the
d Greenback dollar is a legal tender
d for the payment of debt. Then so
long as the law endures, the postage i
d stamp is a legal tender for the par
t pose for which It was ereated, exact~ i
ly as the Greuback dollar shall be a 4
lKgal tender for the panment of
a debts, or for the purpose for which It
I was created.
a MoNEY is never redeemed.
a It needs no redlemi,tin."
I As though the Government could,
a by law, make the dust of the streets i
money. i
It Is true, that the Republican Ad
ministration, by pushig their fund. i
Ing scheme too far, did contract the
currency of the country too much,
Sand did thereby ause stringency i i
the money marlket and great dam- 1

are we yet I a posltion to give our I
attention to soch matters ?
Have we yet fought out to a sluc -
eesful and finoal issue our strogle '
for the right, even to enjoy private a

security of our lives ?
Our oppressora bave been beaten
and driven off for the time nelng, it I
is true, but do you believe, can you
believe, with the evidence before you,
that they are finally annlhilated ?
My honest conviction is that this
OGreenbak movemenat Is Itself a part 0
of their stratelo tacties to divide
the Demooratlc ranks so as to enable C
them to return and recapture their tl
former strongholds; but whether la
am eorreet in this or not, they are
already In the field, sad It Is obvi
ons that they will not encounter so
streoag an opposition from a divided,
as from a unilted foe.

e Dear Vindicator
h It has been some time since we dotted
r, a single item to you, but your reference
a to the nominee for Senator in the D)is
a trict colmposed of Grant, Catamoiula and
t, Wins, rather amused uas and we decided
I. as soon as time would permit to drop
I- you a note in reference to this subject.
e Yes, indeed, we have a "loose nominee"
o at large, but he tightened up on the mass
I, Imeeting called at Colfax and somehow
or rather no one can tell well how he
h got himself endorsed. Yet after all this,
here comes a call flrot the Executive
if Committee of Winn parish asking that
e there be another convention at White
I" Sulphur Springs ont Nov. 10th to try and
it take in the slack on this nominee. There
it is much dissatisfaction amsong the peo.
p- ple and how it will terminate remains
I- yet to be seen. It is charged and pretty
a well sustained that one Bevill frosm Winn
r Parish sold his vote for 100 dollars. If
e he cannot prove Ihis innlmeoCee it is high
e time that he should hide his face from
e the sight 'f all hones m,en. Taking it
, all in all Mr. Luce had better withdraw
altogeter froma the race. As sure as fate
tr the Independent candidate Brian will be
. elected. Many who do not wish to vote
for all Illependent will not vote for
a Luce.
M, Major H. Van McCain for' Represent.
b tives. Charlie Te Illftr Slheriff, and S B.
I dShackleford for Clerk of Court are the
e nominees of the I)lnocratic party of
i. Grant, and be it said that it is onte of the
y strongest and best selected ticket tihe
[- party here has ever put out. Success is
f certain.
Willn l'arish is having a hurdle race
e and altlhosgh it is several niles to the
e Parish lines, the cantdidates are so numn,
r erous we can; almost hear them buzzing
o the voters of the "free State of Winn." 1
s She would fare badly should they all be
elected.
e The greenback movement in your par
ish is exciting a great deal of interest.
We have no Greenbackers in Grant but

Mr. Ju.les Normand
I have been afllicted for
several years with painful inlatmnation
and ulceration of any leg. restulting from
an injury sustained by any buggy wheels
rutlnning over it, I have tried many reld
eidies without avail, until several months
ago I commuticl the uise of "Normanelld's
SIhai," which has been of great benefit
and is the only application, of the many
tried by nme, which has atfforded suhstan
tantial relief-I regard it as invaluable
and cheerfully recomend it for the cer
tain cure of bruises, wounds, cuts, inflam.
oitoation and ulceration.
Yours Respectftlly,

1 Dear Sir-After suffering for thirty
years from a running nicer in the ear
occasioned by a wagon passing on y I
head and after having been operated t
upon by Dr. Logan in New Orleans and
1 and not being cured. I tried some of your
balmn and I anm happy to say that after a ,
I few applicationsol it I got entirely well m
and was radically cured.
A negro boy on any place cut his foot 2
with a plow and it was thought once
that it would have to be amputated but
after applying your halm on the wound
for a few days it healed up and the boy t
is now well. Again, George Cole, a a
neighbor of Inite, whilst shooting a gain, p
a piece of the cap flew inl his eye, we
tried the balt again and with suceess.
His eye got well after two applications
of the balm.
I conclude by stating that in my opin.
ion your balm is an invaluable medicine
and I will take pleasure in recommend.
ing it to the puablic.
Very respectfully,
W. A. CURRY.

wife believing strongly in the virtue of c
your Balm, coneluoded to use some of it
and in a very short tinie effeceted a cure.
:The old woman is now well and able to
testify to the same.
