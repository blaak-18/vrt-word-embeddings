THE RACE PROBLEM IN THE
SOUTH.
In the February 19th number of The
Independent, a weekly magazine - pub
lished inl New "'ork, a copy of which an
esteemed friend has left at hand for
perusal, there is an article on "The
Race Problem in the South" by Samuel
Douglas McEnery. United States Sen
ator from Louisiana. The subject is dis
cussed interestingly and with logical
force, based on facts and conditions, a
knowledge of the inferior race by close
contact and study. Who better than the
whtc man, who from the earliest in
fancy has come in daily contact with
the negro, first as when children, then
as boys playing together, fishing and
hunting and indulging in all the sports
of youth? Is not such a man a better
and safer crit;c than the man raised in
the North, where he has acquired more
or less partisan and prejudicial theories
and vagaries of the negro? Senator Mc
Enery has well said of the negro: "He
holds no office in Northern states of
dignity and imporance where his vote
is in certain localities the balance of
power. Why.. should the South accord
him privileges which are denied to him
in other sections of the Union?"
In his review of the race problem
Senator McEnery has delved into the,
historical records of the antiquity and
in every instance the proof is that the
Caucasian has dominated over all the
inferior races. It is as possible to elim
inate these racial distinctions as it is to
remove the leopard's spots by which
this ferocious animal is distinguished at
a glance from all the wild beasts of the
forest or the jungle. After a careful
perusal of this article we must com
mend Senator McEnery's presentation
of a subject that should impress favor
ably the minds prepared to be ihflu
enced with reasonable facts and ready
to 'receive the truth, but the editor of
The Independent in a caustic editorial
reviews Mr. McEnery's article, the logic
of which he attempts in vain to min
imize, by addressing himself to his
readers, in a tone 'and temper which in
dicates that he his not outgrown the
iprejaudice, the fanatical impressions
_ f.at `o his mind by Uncle Tom's Cabin
'and 'srtimilr' alesuimial:.sstoies, sag
* esrc4 at a tfsa *be thef Puritanical
spirit It the NWorth dominated and led
to an internicene war the. like of
which is without a parallel' in 'history
and which shocked" the civilized worth
with horror. Unfortunately "the editor
of The Independent is afflicted with
negroism from which' he can never re
cover, and therefore he is not compe
tent to criticise so serious a subject,
which in its consideration should have
enlisted his best thoughts and most
liberal views. This man, however, is a
fair sample of millions in the North,
prejudiced in mind and body, who in
sist on the social and political equality
af the African and the Caucasian in the
South but would abhor, revolt at the
very suggestion of a' negro son-in-law,
or of the negro being introduced and
entertained in the company of his wife
and daughters and their lady friends.
In words, indefinite .this man holds to
ridicule the declaration of Mr.' McEn
ery, the truth of which supported by
Divine authority, is "that the amalga
tion of .the races is impossible," and to
sustain his vagaries as to negro tqual
ity and the "paroxysmal impulse now
taking possession of the negro rac& in
this century," he points to the last half
century during which, he says,: "the
Japanese nation' .with., the Caucasian
t.he a front rank among the strong and
intellectual nations of the world." It is
trve the progress of,the Japanese has
been wnMderful, but they are of the
Mo1golian race and can never rise to
the ,Caucasian; who must dominate, in
:time, the entire world, and while the
negro will advance and progress (if let
alon by the Puritanical fanaties of the
North) he can sever epect to reach a
plane of the superior races, first of
.which is thea Caasians, th the Mion

_order, but with all his eaustic criticism

gestion of marital relations which exist
in the North between the races would
be repugnant and scandalous. It is not
possible for a couple of the races to
marry in Louisiaha, but such relations
are legalized in Massachusetts and
states of the North, but cultured Bos
ton. rushing Chicago and sedate Phila
delphia would indignate and bounce
unceremoniously the negro, educated
and polished if you will, who would
venture in their circle as a social equal.
The "twaddle' of these howling, cant
ing hypocrite,- too full of prejudice and
hase to reason, and always moved by
the uncharitable imnpulse, the prejudicial
unfriendliness towards the South incul
cated in their being by their forefathers
n ho stole niggers in Africa and then
sold them o the South: these people,
of which The Independent's editor is no
doubt one, are not fit counsellors or ad
visers or guides and should cease their
intermeddling with the negro.
Let the negro alone.
In the South the negro is receiving
all the advantages of public schools;
he is fully protected in all his rights and
property, and the same bar which rules
and fixes the social relations of the
classes of the Caucasian race, governs
the negro in the selection of his asso
ciates in his home. There can be no
social equality and in a political sense
the man qualified under the law, Cau
casian or African, can vote. The safety
of good government has demanded the
restriction of the ballot, under provis
ions fixed by law in each State of the
South, and these limitations of the suf
frage: fixed as they are in Massachu
setts and Pennsylvania, operate to the
disfranchisement of white men because
they can not comply with the legal re
quirements o the law. But, seriously,
it is not possible to reason with any
man, hide-botmd with prejudice, these
"holier than thou" men who in a politi
cal sense would rip up a Southern man
in the back with the right hand while
handing him a Bible with the left. The
South should expect no fair treatment
from the canting, sanctimonious hypo
c'ites at the North. The South's safety
must rest on the preservation at all
hazards of the present relations between
the races, which insures the rule of in
telligence and white supremacy; the
political and the social prominence in
all things 'which are sacred to and con
cerns the South alone. This is plain.
But here is Mr. McEnery's views on
the race problem in the oSuth, and
which will be endorsed by all Southern
men:
"The negro is here to stay.. He can
not be departed. It would be a cruel
and .iarsh measure and would be im
prgticaI. The Soithb as a unit is op
posed to .his dbpo ation. He is needed
because" he is a very valuable laborer,
and, treated 'with impartiality and jus
tice, he will ,be a potent factor in the
developmelnt of the South, in all field
and industrial occupations open to him
and suitable to his mental, moral and
physical training. The question is a
daily one, What to do with the negro?
The answer is let him alone and let him
work out his own destiny on lines fixed
and unchangeable."
DON;T, UNDERTAKE TOO MUCH.
"Several of our exchanges," says The
Felicianas, "are beginning to enumerate
and urge the various measures and re
forms they wish to force in. the next
campaign. There are few of these we" do
not approve, but it will be a serious
error to complicate matters by under
taking tco much at one time. The pub
lic school system, for instance, will do
as it is for the present. There is no use
dragging it into the next campaign.
It is extremely doubtful if it could be
improved by doing so. So it is with 1
other issues mentioned. The main is- [
sues-the issues of vital interest-upon 4
which all other reforms and ,inprovt
ments must of necessity depend, are thi:.
adoption of primaries as a meas
making nominations, and the aboliti
of State patronage.
"At present our party organization is
maintained through an elaborate ap-x' I
pointive system of office-holders. It is
true that, nominally, we have an inde
pendent party-organization, but in real
ity it is not true, as is witnessed by the
formation of our State Central Com
mittee. Our party organization is built
up and maintained on the theory that
administartion exercise and contfol of
the State patronage is necessary for its
success.
"Let us review the origin and more
talient features "of this plan:
"It had its origin in the reconstruc
tion period and was adopted as a means
of deprivint negroes of as many of the
rights and privileges conferred by bal
lot as possible.
"No one will deny that, it accom
pised tlis result.
"Now two important facts will be'
noticed in this connection:

Demrti.c, or :white men's party, of t

interests of one party or faction, at the
expense of another, has built up an op
position within its own party ranks.
Thus we have the administration and
anti-administration party of this State!
And we are bound to have them as long
as the system remains. It distinctly or
ganizes and maintains, with the unfair
advantage of government patronag.e
one faction within the party at the ex
pense of another. No matter how wisely
or efficiently the government may be
administered, an administration and
anti-administration party is the in
evitable result. So that, as a matter of
fact, it maintains factional organization
arid breeds discord within the party
ranks.
"But this is not the only anomaly
presenfed by this method of party or
ganization or machinery. By disfran
chising the white voters of the State
with the same methods and laws em
ployed in disfranchising the ignorant
and vicious negroes of the reconstruc
tion period, and other equally undemo
cratic methods, it controls the true
democratic sentiment and majority of
this State.
"This is the most important question
that confronts the people of Louisiana
today. When any element or issue of
discord exists within the party it should
if possible be removed. True, the ques
tion is much larger than one of party
merely, but for the sake of party and
party harmony alone it should be
changed. This great State can no longer
afford to claim or maintain a parent
right to: dabble in petty politics-to en
fore against its honest, intelligent white
citizens reconstruction extremes and
subterfuges that were designed only -to
check deluded negroes and unprincipled
whites.
"Until this patronage is entirely de
stroyed there will be no political free
dom in Louisiana. It is not enough to
ask of gubernatorial candidates how
they stand on this issue. The fight must
begin at home. No man should be elect
ed to either branch of the Legislature
henceforth who is not unequivocally
pledged to work and vote for the aboli
tion of the last vestige of this patron
age." . .
The Felicianas is right. The fight is
now on and must be pressed forward.
For years the Caucasian, single-handed,
has been urging the return of all power
to 'the people. The government by the
people and for the people must triumph
over the schemings of the few who have
dominated the Democracy in their self
ish interest-for personal aggrandize
nent. This movement for the reform of
an abuse, tolerated fd" years on the plea
â¢f-a necessity which no longer exists, is!
~prwing. growing and becoming power
fil because it is as just' as it is right.i

'Ten cents for July cotton." That is
what the New Orleans papers say. It
Is good news and may be an indication
of the price the staple will bring next
season.-Mansfield Journal.
How many of the growers and the
producers will have cotton for sale in
July at Io cents? This price is no indi
caticn that cotton will range next sea
son at the pr(sent quotations. The pru
dent and practical planter or farmer
will grow all the corn and feedstuff pos
sible, including a few hogs, etc., and
then plant all the cotton he will be able
to gather during the picking season.
With a full supply of such products as
he can grow and if not grown he must
buy, he will be ready to take advantage
of the cotton market.
In speaking of Teddy Roosevelt's
negro policy, Sam Jones says "most
every man is some kind of a fool, but
the mon who is all kinds of a fool ought
to be locked up."
There is no vaulting more startling
and. surprising than the leaps of some
politicians--gentlemen anticipating a
strike by political lightning.

The Times-Democrat says: "The
United Daughters of the Confederacy,
assisted by the Confederate Southern
Memorial Associations, will in April,
hold at Richmond, Va.. a bazaar for the
bvnefit of the Jefferson Davis Memorial
Arch, and for the Confederate museum,
which is now established in the mansion
in which President Davis resided dur
ing the war. They therefore ask the help
of every mnan, woman and child, in, or
der that the entire South may shade in
the honor. The association of the Jeffer
son Davis Monument, U. D. C., has a
director in each State. and the Confed
erate museum a regent, who represents
the room owned by each State in the
Southern Confederacy, and will be rep
resented by a table bearing its name,
shield and colors, and articles received
will be given to the table which may be
designated by the donor. )
"It is befitting that to the dauntless

Fr eight years Father Scha-l was
pastor of Holy Trinity, succeeding the
late Father Gcntille. During his pastor
ate the parish has flourished, and his
management of its affairs was always
wise and conservative, and he leavts its
financial affairs in much better condi

Who will be his successor is not vet
