Harmony is not as characteristic of
church choirs as it should be, and fash
ionable St. Thomas' choir in New York
is now going through the agony of a
quarrel, as the result of the swell wed
dings recently celebrated there. The
choir consists of fifty voices, and at
both the Marlborough-Vanderbilt and
Paget-Whitney weddings rendered very
elaborate musical programmes. Hand
some checks were sent in payment,
Mr. Whitney having sent, it is claim
ed, $1500. The organist received these
checks and the singers are complain
ing that he didn't divide fair. lie gave
each one a sealed enveloped with their
part, and cautioned them not to open
it until they reached home. One young
girl was so anxious to see what she
had gotten that she rushed home, tore
open the envelope and found a $2 bill.
The Yellow River.
The Yellow river is styled the "Sor
row of China." During the last cen
tury it has changed its course twenty
two times and now flows into the sea
through a mouth 300 miles distant
from that of 100 years ago. It is esti
mated that its floods in the present
century have cost China 11,000,000
lives.
Ireland's Chance.
Wnen England is busy watching the
United States and other nations whose
movements she cannot afford to neglect,
that will be the time for Ireland to
arouse herself and vigorously twist the
tail of the oppressive British lion on
her own account. The war cry will
be: '-Throw him down, McCloskey!"
The Cost.
Senator Peffer says it costs the gov
ernment about $3000 to bury a United
States senator in any sort of style. It
certainly costs the government a great
deal more than that to keep a senator
alive a year.

Madam Bolsvert.
I am a mid-wife and have been giving 1
McElree's Wine of Cardui and Black-.
Draught tea to my lady patients, both
during pregnancy and after birth as a
tonic, and have found the treatment will
do more than is claimed for it. Two years
ago I was troubled with female weakness
myself, that I could not work at all. I
heard McElree's Wine of Cardui recom
mended, and got six bottles of it, and a i
mammoth package of Thedford's Black
Draught. I began the treatment as di
rected, and in two weeks I had improved I
so much I could do my work, and have
never been troubled with it since.

A Novel Idea.
The Omaha Weekly World-Herald
has struck another novel idea for in
creasing its circulation by offering large
prizes to those new subscribers who
construct the shortest sentence contain
ing all the letters of the alphabet.
This is sort of reverse of last year's i
prize contest, when the object was to
construct the largest number of words
out of certain letters.
It will be interesting to note how
short a sentence can be made and still
contain all the twenty-six letters in the
alphabet. The trouble, of course, will
Le to get in such letters as x, y, z and q.
Ex-Congressman Bryan, who edits

Collcges and Secret Socletles.
The secret society problem has been
one of the most difficult that has con
fronted American colleges. It has led
to endless disputes, and in many cases
where the college is controlled by
church denominations it has been a
bone of contention in the ecclesiastical
conferences. The great University of
Chicago has solved this problem in 7
broad way by recognizing the frator
nities officially, and hereafter they will
be reckoned as a distinct feature of
university life. It is the only ufver
alty in the world that has met the
Greeks" on even terms, and it is be
lieved that the fraternity men, appre
crating this liberality, will be valuable
aids in upholding the moral standard
of the university. President Harper is
quoted as saying: "I hope the days
of conflict between college authorities
and smcret fraternities is now over, and
I believe that the step we have taken,
though radial is one in the right di
rectiona"
