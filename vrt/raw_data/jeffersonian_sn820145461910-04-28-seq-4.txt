FARMERS’ UNION PAGE
DUCKWORTH’S BREAK ANGERED
FARMERS.
Dear Sir: —Every unbiased mind
ed white man of the Southern States,
whether a member of the F. E. and
C. U. of A., or not, is obliged to con
sider the ungentlemanly and unchris
tian editorial in Duckworth’s nasty
sheet concerning your attendance at
the St. Louis Convention a direct in
sult to President Barrett, to every
member of the F. E. and C. U. of A.,
and a GROSS insult to Southern man
hood.
Go to St. Louis, Mr. Watson, you
are needed there. The June Conven
tion will give that Union City mess
what Paddy gave the drum (hell).
Your friend through thick and
thin, J. L. H. WOODMAN.

HABERSHAM FARMERS INTER
ESTED.
Dear Sir: —I will let you know The
Jeffersonians are “doing some” in
this neck of the woods. Farmers’ Un
ion members are very anxious about
the charges made by T. E. W. being
answered, and unless there is some
disposition, SATISFACTORILY, at
the National Convention, it is a gone
cat in Habersham county, sure.
As I have got la grippe, will not
write more this time.

CO-OPERATION THE REMEDY
FOR FARMERS’ ILLS.
Dear Sir: —Yours received, with
address of the Hon. C. S. Barrett,
etc., for which I thank you. I see in
The Jeffersonian of March 24th you
are to address the Convention in St.
Louis May 2d, “The Agriculture of
the South,” etc. I want to call your
attention at this time to an article of
mine, “Good Advice to the Cotton
Grower,” of December 14, 1908,
which you kindly published in the
weekly Jeffersonian, page 14, Jan
uary 7, 1909, suggesting that they
adopt co-operation as a solution and
a remedy, to build their own manu
factories, to own and operate them,
etc. If it is agreeable to you and
your ideas, can’t you make some sug
gestions along that line in your ad
dress, advocate it as an important
thing to do at this time? There would
be millions of dollars in it to the cot
ton growers, it would unite, cement
and hold together and increase their
membership, make one of the largest
and best organizations in the world.
It would increase the wealth of the
farmers, make them independent. To
estimate all the benefits and growth
at this time is hardly possible. Un
derstand me, I only make this as a
suggestion not desiring to advise you
what to say, as you have your own
ideas and are fully capable of mak
ing your own address, you are doubt
less more familiar with co-operation.
The Rockdale system in England,
how it was started by a few working
men with very little money, its
growth, etc.
I would like very much to attend
that convention, I am an old Missour
ian, but I have not the time nor
money to spare. I remain,
Yours truly, J. D. BAILEY,
Vice-President U. S. Monetary
League.

MISSISSIPPI FARMERS ARE DIS
SATISFIED AT PROCEDURE.
Dear Sir: —We are sending you
some more resolutions that we want
you to publish for us. We know that
you are a friend that we can always
rely on. We don’t know whether
our Mississippi Union Advocate will
publish our resolutions or not, but I
think probably it will this time, as
we have written them a very strong
letter pointing out the mistake that
Editor Ward made before in not
granting our request. He has re
signed, it is true, but we want no
more official organs.
I am with you in that 100,000
Club. I expect to send you some
new subscribers in a week or so. I
got Mr. Beard, of Duck Hill, to get
up a lot there. I don’t know how
many he got, but he told me that he
thought that he could get about
twenty. I haven’t seen him since, but
Mr. West, the depot agent, told me
that he subscribed, and that he had
just got his second copy, was well
pleased, and that he thought Mr.
Beard got a good many. I have been
so hard at work getting my crop
planted that I haven’t had time to do
much else, but am going to a Union
oyster supper next Saturday night in
Grenada county, and I think that I
can make a run on the boys. Wish
ing you well, J. H. POWELL.

Resolutions and protest adopted
and passed by Rankin Local No. 447,
Lilac, Miss.:
Resolved, That we discontinue our
support to the Union Advocate, our
official organ of the Mississippi Farm
ers’ Union, because we believe that
this official organ has been, and will
continue to be, one of the main
causes of thousands of our brethren
refusing to pay their dues.
And whereas, before the introduc
tion and adoption of said organ we
had, as reported through the papers,
between 65,000 and 70,000 mem
bers, now only 25,000 are enrolled.
And whereas, before the introduc
tion of this organ, in 1908, our Local
had a paid up membership of fifty
odd, after the paper was introduced
our membership fell to twenty-one in
1909.
, And whereas, in 1910, so far only
fourteen have paid their dues, and
two of them have since gone into the
mercantile business, which leaves
only twelve members in good stand
ing.
And whereas, we do know, and are
very confident that the adoption
of this official organ, and the mak
ing of it compulsory on the mem
bers of our Union to either take this
organ or go out of the order, has
been one of the main causes of this
dropping off of our membership at
this Local, and also throughout the
whole State, because, under the pres
ent management, the system virtual
ly says to every Union member you
must support this organ or go out of
the Union, that making it compul
sory, which is a direct blow destroy
ing our individual rights as free men.
And whereas, our individual rights
as free men should be as sacred to us
as our honor, and we should not, and
are not, willing to sacrifice these
rights even to the majority rule, no
more than we would or should be
willing to sacrifice our honor to the
majority rule; therefore be it
Resolved, That we enter our pro
test against the further support of
this official organ, unless it can be so
arranged and so fixed that this or
gan stand upon its merits, or demer
its, and thus leave every member free
to pay his dues, with or without the
incumbrance of the paper, thus leav
ing it optional with each member
about taking the paper; therefore,
be it
Further resolved, That we, the
members of Ranking Local, do here
by record ourselves, and wish it to
be distinctly understood, that when
the time rolls around to again pay
our dues, that unless this matter is
arranged, as above mentioned, or
something similar, we will not pay
our dues.
Resolved further, That we call up
on all Locals and county meetings
throughout the State to take up this
matter, investigate it and act, for
this official organ, under its present
arrangement and past management,
is absolutely ruining our order.
Glje TLffersonian
Resolved further, That a copy of
these resolutions be sent to the Mis
sissippi Union Advocate, Jackson,'
Miss., for publication, also to The
Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga.
Unanimously adopted April 16th.

A STRONG LETTER FROM AN F.
U. MAN.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l am very
sorry indeed to note your refusal to
go to St. Louis to address the Farm
ers’ Convention. I was so proud of
the invitation tendered you, it made
me feel good.
In reference to Duckworth’s letter:
It does not amount to a continental
cuss. Who pays any attention to
what he says? Nobody. As for you
breaking down the Union, he does
not think anything of the kind. If
Duckworth and his gang don’t break
it down, it surely will stand forever.
He said you will get into politics;
bless your life, ninety per cent, of
the Union men will go with you, and
they believe what you tell them. The
Union law, or consitution, does not
prohibit members from doing what
they believe to be right. If your go
ing to the convention gets us in poli
tics, let us'go galloping. Your going
to the convention is not the point
with Duck. Why doesn’t he come out
like a man and tell the truth? I guess
it was the only thing he could think
of to say about you; he has not man
hood enough to even resist the
charges made against him. It is a
certain fact the Unoion boys believe
everything told on the Union City
gang. We are going to have a gen
eral straightening this summer. I
think Duck and his gang had better
get under a peck measure and stay
there. We don’t believe a word they
say. I have known you for twenty
five years; you are the first man I
ever voted for; I have heard you
speak many times; I have never in
my life heard you say anything that
was not for the good of the farmers
and the laboring classes. Ever since
1890 your principles have been on
the same line as today; the very same
principles the Union advocates. No
man can dispute it.
Your paper is a live wire indeed,
the best on the market; let us hear
from you good and strong, let it hit
who it may.
I am yours to the end,
WILLIAM D. STEPHENS.

Prevent and
Relieve Headache
"It gives me great pleasure to
be able to refer to Dr. Miles'
Anti-Pain Pills as the best rem
edy we have yet had in our
house for the prevention and
cure of headache. My wife who
has been a constant sufferer for
a number of years with above
complaint joins me in the hope
that they may fall into the hands
of all sufferers.”
JOHN BUSH,
Watervleit, Me.
Used Them Four Years.
"Dr. Miles* Anti-Pain Pills
are the best I ever tried for the
relief of headache. I have used
them for nearly four years and
they never fail to give me relief.
I have tried many other rem
edies, but have never found any
better.”
JOSEPH FRANKOWICK,
854 Trombly Av., Detroit, Mich.
There is no remedy that will
more quickly relieve any form
of headache than
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills.
The best feature of this re
markable remedy is the fact that
it does not derange the stomach
or leave any disagreeable after
effects.
Druggists everywhere sell them. If
first package fails to benefit, your drug*
gist will return your money.
