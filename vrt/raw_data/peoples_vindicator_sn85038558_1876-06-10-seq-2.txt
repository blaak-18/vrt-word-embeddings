The South and West.
The Citcinnatti Enquirer seems sur
prised that the Southern States should
Sunite with the East in political action
and move in concord with the East
. ern D)emocrats. It professes to be
Smuch angered at the possibility of the
Southern delegates to the St. Louis
- Convention voting for an Eastern
man, Tilden, for instance, as the pro.
per Presidential candidate for the
I Democratic party in the coming con
Op test.
oN Patriotically speaking, the Enquirer
o is pursuning a course of political rea
"' soning--a line of conduct which pre
0Jo cedent would condemn, and which,
 in our humble judgement, is detri
me- mental to public prosperity. We
suppose we can say this without pro
e ycoking the ire of that journal-with.
id out being called a "flat-headed idiot,"
its usual argument for so doing.
SWe are not willing to discuss the
a "currency question" with any one at
td this time; our want of ability to con
or ceire the subject in a proper manner
ý- must be taken an' i sufficient excuse,
and that itself deters us from such an
undertaking. Should the Enquirer
ooadopt these suggestions-drop the
.0@ question for the same reason, it would,
no doubt, be a matter of much con
gratulation among many readers and
thinkers of the Democratic party.
TheSouth fails to see any thing in
the future save commercial wreck
and ruin for the American people by
a continued, persistant tinker at the
, money of the country by financial
legislation by political parties. If
politicians-will hands off the money
question, we venture to say that trade
will regulate it handsomely and spee
dily. Supply and demand are the
points in political economy for the
people to study-the creation of pro
ducts to bring money into localities,
bring it by reason of a demand, also
created by proper legislation, from
other localities, will bring prosperi
ty; will bring money, and all the
, -paper mills and printing machines in
or America cannot do so otherwise.
" Stimulate an active healthy demand,
both, local and foreign, for American
I products and manufacture, encourage
those industries of the country at
large to supply it, and currency will
regulate itself by the inexorable laws
of trade. So long as the opposite to
h this is persued; so long as states.

the ignorant idea of the "hair of the

so long will people complain of hard

Eniquirer and its people have lost
sight of-the South has not !
Fourteen Southern States ared nder
the grinding heel of the military of
the nation, used by the Radical party
as a means to plunder and outrage
us-to africanize onu land and starve
our people, and nothing arouses the
desperation of our nature as the dread
of starvation at the hearth of our
household. The Enquirer and its
followers think this is secondary to
its pet currency scheme. The South
does not!
Louisiana for instance, is ruled by
thieves, villains and jail-birds-when
on the point, but a few months ago,
of righting her own wrongs at any
cost, the Democracy of Ohio, as well
as of the North, solemnly pledged them
seeles to do it themselves should te for
ebLear. We have done so. We have
placed our e:se in their hands and
we demand a fulfilment of that pledge.
t The Enquirer has forgotten that
promise. Louisiana and the South
r have not ! The Enquirer drowns the
death cry of Louisiana with its in
sane shrieks of "down with the bond
Sholderr'! The South sees this and
feels that political and moral death
await her people by an alliance with
such stupidity, we call it that, rather
than treason, as is evinced by the
Ohio Democrats. On the other hand
the East is ready and anxious to as
k sist tus-stands prepared to fulfil to
the letter the pledge made to relieve
e us from bondage, to place us in full
I fellowship with our sister States of
the Union. The South looks to her
interest-consults her welfare by
e forming as she does, a political alli
ance offensive and defensive with the
e East. We have profited by the sad
E experience of the past, we look for
friends to help us materially; we are
not in a condition to subsist on the
"Chameleon's dish;" we have been
"promise crammed" for ten years,
and want fulfilment, demand it now.
The East will do this for us. The
West has gone off into the marsh of
impracticability after ajack-a-lantern
currency, where they will sink in rain
and disaster. The South will follow
no such lead as that. Allen may be,
and no doubt is, an honest man-but
Slie is visionary and impracticable;
powerless as an individual to com
mand a following that could assist
na.
The people of the South repudiate
such Democracy as that which the
Cincinnatti Convention enunciated,
the ideas are antagonistic to sound
political economy--they are calcula
ted to divide our people-to call pub
lie attention from the questions at
issue and lead off the voter into false
grounds. Whatever foolish thing
we may do, whatever idiotic thing
we have done in the past, the South
will never so fair forget .its duty to
her people as by taking stock in the
Bill Allen.I-qtrer moveuiaent.
, Thee are our views upon, our rea
sons why "we do not joino the Wesft"
-why we ally ourselves with the
Easterna States. They can be taken
for what they are worth, but we feel
assured we express the views of
nine-tenths of our thinking popula
tion.
V aleditory.
In taking up the editorial pen, I
only acted as I think and hope I am
I doing in laying it aside, for the sole
good and benefit of na party anad
people. I had no other nfaterest to sub
serve, and if I have contributed in
the least.to thre saueess of the cauase
we all have so mauch at heart, the
personal sacrifeices I have made will
commt as nothing, and be remembered
only to stimulate me to still greater
exertions. I give into the hands of
J. H. Cosgrove, his paper, feeling
ce tain that hIe being its lfonder, can
accomplish perhaps more for the par
ty than I can. I feel deeply grateful
to the friends of the party through- i
out the State and Union, who so
kindly lent me thilr assistance, and
I hereby tender to them, and partica
larly to the members of the Press,
my heartfelt thanks. And, now in
conclusion would say, that though my
journalistic career has ended, my in
terest in the great cause of virtue
and intelligence against vinality and
corrnption, will remain the same, and
if it is ever in my power to aid the
party of the people, it will alwayrsaf
ford me the greatestt haplnness.

The near approach of a political
contest is plainly apparent from tile
fact that the Radical press of the
State is burdened with the old, old
story of blood, murder and howling
e white league. This sort of thing we
he have, in the cours of time grown
used to; we have heard it so often
r that the mere head lines of such sto
ries is generally elough to make as
put down the paper in slicer disgust.
However, after the exploits of the
Great Unknown at Coaushatta, and
n the exploits of the negroes in Wil
kinson county, Mississippi,-we should
' think the game of the Radical leaders
pretty well exposed. Of the Con
slhiatta matter much was said in abuse
of. the citizens of Red River parish in
general. The IRpnbliean of New Or
e leans was the grand reservoir of lies
d from which the lesser organs obtain
' ed their supply of abuse. Scissors
were busy for a week or so and the
Ihowl was truly beautiful for a time,
O when low and behold ! an oat-break
of far greate.i omeut than the deed'
of an unknowbr-man takes place. In
Wilkinson county, Mississippi, an
Sarmed band of ngroes attack and
murder a country store keeper, the
Sheriff goes with a posse to arrest the
perpetrators of this dastardly deed
when he is fired upon by the infuria.
I.
ted mob, when he in turn fires upon,
kills some and disperses the remain
11 der of the negroes.
At once the "loyal press"comes to
the rescue with full columns of mur
der and outrage by white eitizens of
Loujgiana. Now, this affair has been
investigated, and that very promptly,
when it is shown, as we have stated,
it was in Mississippi, not Louisiana,
where these disturbances have trans
pired, and in the manner we have re
Slated them. Gen. Anger, Command
n ing this Department, had been ap
' pealed to by the faithful Radical
thieves of Feliciana for military aid,
but he saw no, necessity for his in
terference and so reported to Wash
Sn ng. Meanwhile Kellogg is on there'
raising all the interest he can in the
matter; fortifying the lies of his
' New Orleans Republican with dis
patches from private Secretary Clark,
detailing death and destruction as
occurring in his State, and calling for
"more troops !
Now, tot our mind, the purpose of
e all this is to plain to gall the Ameri.
e can citizen, and that seems the view
taken of it at Weshington, for Kel
logg was snubbed. When reduced to
the extremity of saddling a fight
between a Republican Sheriff and his
posse, in Wilkinson county, Mississ

Not Well Received.
Some few republican papers in this
State are striking their own party
some' very heavy blows; notably
among these are the State Register and
Homer Iliad. The study of the com
meIts of the party press throughout
the State upon their utterances, af
fords but slander hope on their part
of successfully inculcating reform
into the loyal radicals of Louisiana.
When Collins and Blackburn in
their editorial capacities proceed to
go for some radical thieving official
who has been prominent in rascality
heretofore and now looms up as a re
form (?) republican candidate, the
whole array of pups, from the thieves
own in New Orleans down to the Nat
chitoches Republiean, proceed to go for
these editors who dare abuse the hon
eat (1) patriots of republicanism, with
a vim that is truly refreshing in these
degenerated days. We are sure that
the Iliad and State Register are meet
ing with but little encouragement in
the hopeless task they have underta
ken of cleaning the augean stable
of Louisiana radicalism, and if truly
in earnest, as we must allow they are,
must in time become disgusted with
the coldness and opposition with
which their endeavors are received.
In striking contrast to these jour.
nals are the majority of the "print
ing law" press of the State. They in
dnlge In the howl of honesty and re
form, pledge themselves to support
none but honest men for office, &c.,
in one column and in the next "com
mend to the cordial support of the
honest republican masses" such char
acters as Warmoth, Packard, Mat
Wells, Pinchback and Tomn Anderson,
and the entire host of proven radical
thieves. That's Radical virtue (t)
you see.
The nomination of George L. Smith,
of Caddo, for Congress frm this Dis
trict by the Radicals, has caused a
flare up. Wells, the R-B-- comes
out in a card repudiating the entire
concern, and the chances are that
another man will divide the honors (t)
of the minority vote of the District.
These people need not create so
much noise about this nominatiod,
for the District is hopelessly Demo
cratic, the largest in fact, of any Dis
trict in the State, and the honors will
be enjoyed by a Democrat.certain.
Some radical of Natchitoches has
telegraphed thusly to the Shreveport
Telegram :
"The nomnaation of Mr. Smith is
heartely endorsed in this parish and
he will receive the entire Republican
vote, besides a great many of the op
position."
That George L. Smith will receive
the entire republrcan vote, who would
vote for an average radical, we do
not in the least doubt. Myers was a
candi&ate for nomination before the
Shreveport radicale concern, but failed
to come in whereupon Boollt has left
for New Orleans in disgust. Bonllt
runs the radical machine here with
the help of Blunt, Lewis and Myers,
and unless something is done Bonllt
will go over to Mat Wells or Myers
will run iudependent.
However, this is no fight of ouars,
but when the telegrapher of the Tde
egram from hliere states that "great
many of the opposition" wouald vote
for Smith he simply insults the bon
esty and lintelligence t of our people.
Not one aocra,4~ sot ose Coservative
of Natchitocbes would so far degrade
himself as to vote for any candidate
put in the field by Van Dousen, Eer
nack, Keeting or Bill Harper and the
Telepram can rest assured of that fact.
8mlth, we consider, a worse man
than Myers or Wells, and they are
am infamous sM men mn be, else
it be were not, the "crew" that
nominated him wmuld never have
done.so. The Telegram can continue
to compliment Boullt and Ezernaek
for they re birds of a feather with it
bat as to mayling that the nomionatlo
of Smith is a "reform movement" we
beg leave to differ. It is going to re
form a La crawfish.

Through the kindness of Hion. E.
John Ellis, chairman of the Commit
tee on the Mississippi Levees, we
have received the very able, full and
complete report of that committee to
the House of Representatives. The
report after going over all the ground
showing the great necessity, as well
as the great advantages to be derived
from the work recommended, thus
concludes :
It will thus be seen that all the engi
neers advise the inmtnediate repairing and
rebuilding of the levees of the Mississip
pi River. lIowew'er widely they may and
do differ upon other points and plans,
they all concur that it is of the very first
and highest importance to rebuild the
levees. A great permanent plan cannot
in the opinion of your committee, be de
termined upon until after a thorough sur
vey of the Mississippi River and its tri
butaries; and this work will require
three years for its completion In the
mean time, absolute ruin and the loss of
millions of dollars threaten the unfor
tunate dwellers in the alluvial region.
The States through their governors
and legislatures, have asked this boon.
The chambers of commerce and boards
of trade ask it
The threatened and suflfering commerce
of the Mississippi River, amounting an
nually to untold millions, asks it. To
free that river you vexed its waters with
gunboats, jarred its banks with artillery,
and poured into its breast as a liberation
the blood of thousands of brave men.
Will you not now give a few millions to
preserve its untold usefulness and save
its commerce 1
The sufferers of the overflowed regions,
who were obliged to eat the bread of
charity, from their ruined homes and
fields ask it.
You gave more than one-third the sum
we ask to be expended in displaying the
triumphs of our civilization and its re
joicing over the one hundredth year of
our existence as a government. Have
you no treasure to spare to save the im
periled interests and hopes of the fairest
and finest portion of your domain, and
this, too, when it promisses to return to
you your treasure "sixty and an hundred
fohds" within a few brief years t
Public policy and the general welfare
requires that this work be done. Every
section ofourcountry will be benefited.
The re-opened and reclaimed plantations
will need gins, engines, machinery of
every character, coal, and farming-uten
sils, and the heart of the mechanic and
machinist and miner of the North that
now throbs beneath idly-folded arms will
quicken with the thrill of work and
wages again. The laborers upon the
reclaimed lands will want the thousand
articles of value and convenience pro
dune by northern skill and enterprise,
and the producers of these will rejoice
that their custom is revived again.
Political economy approves this great
work and the Constitution sanctions it.
The rest is with the enlightened judg
ment of the representatives of the Amer
ican people.
The consistancy of some statesmen
is remarkable to say the least of it,
and we are much reminded that this
sublime virtue is being somewhat
abused by a perusal of the speech of
the Hon. John H. Mitchell, Senator
from Oregon, delivered lately in the
U. 8. Senate upon the immigration of
Chinese. During the remarks of this
gentleman, Mr. Sargent, republican
Senator from California, interjected
the following4a reply to an argument
upon the naturalization of the Chinese.
If m'g friend will allow me, I will
say that the people of the Pacific
coast do not widsh them to be natural
ized. Naturalization would only add
to the mischiets. Put thie ballott iii
the hands of the sixty thousand Chli
nese in California, and they would be
marshaled in squads at the polls by
their masters, the six compsnles,
with ballots prepared beforehand and
dictated to them, and the influence of

hands with horror at the utterances of
such as oppose thie africanization of

and protected by the gentleman's
party and the gentleman's adminis
tration. A culttvaion of the golden
rule might lead to happy results with
men of Mr. argent's class. In fact
