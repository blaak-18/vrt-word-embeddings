LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
AN EYE OPENER.
Paris, Mo.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My dear Sir: I am sending you a
money order for one dollar ($1.00)
for which please send the monthly
magazine to J. P. Foree, of Paris,
Mo. lam very anxious for Mr. Foree
to get the April number. If you can,
please send it to him.
I wish as many as possible to read
your letter on Foreign Missions. It
is certainly an eye opener to the
blind if they will only read and digest
the truths that it contains. I think
just as many preachers have got
about as far from preaching the Word
laid down in the Bible by Jesus Christ
and his apostles, as the Democratic
and Republican parties are from the
teachings of Jefferson and Lincoln.
Mr. Watson, I want to express my
deepest appreciation of your letter
on Foreign Missions. It is to be
greatly regretted that it cannot be
read and apreciated by all deceivers
and deceived.
With kindest regards and best
wishes for your success in the grand
work you are doing for the common
people, I remain,
Sincerely your friend,
J. P. Rudasill.
AN ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNG
POPULIST.
Cordova, Ala.
Mr. Thomas E. Watson.
Kind Friend: I read both the Jef
fersonians and love their principles.
I often talk about the Populists and
most all of my associates know that
I am a young Populist, just eighteen
years of age. I expect to point out
the corruptness of the old parties.
I know that the trail is blazed, the
road is open over which I shall travel
till the hoary hair shall cover my
head: then when mine eyes shall have
closed in death, and I laid in the
tomb, it would be an honor to me for
some old Jeffersonian to write 11 Jef
fersonian” on my tomb.

A PLEA FOR WHITE
SUPREMACY.
Stanesvillb, W. Ya.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: I have been thinking
of writing to you for a long time. I
have been a great lover of your writ
ings and endorse, or rather, accept,
your political creed. Have voted for
you for eight years, —the only vote
that has been cast for you at my pre
cinct. But by reading your Atlanta
address to three of my neighbors (two
Democrats and one Republican) they
accepted your views and expressed a
desire to vote for you, but the poll
clerks refused to fill out their ballots
as they wished and they did not vote
at all.
I truly admire your courage and
manhood. You are making a great
fight for white supremacy,—a noble
work indeed. May the God of heaven
bless you in this great cause. To see
social equality (that damnable curse
which inevitably leads to amalgama
tion, the crime of crimes that has de
stroyed civilization after civilization
from the face of the earth) stamped
out of our country has been one of
my fondest dreams. You and I may
differ very materially on the negro
question, yet we are together for
white supremacy. I have been fight
ing the negrophiles of my section for
more than eight years. I have five
little girls and two little boys, as
sw’eet little ones as ever lived, but
knowing that we have thousands of
mixed blacks in our country that are
so light that it would take an expert
to distinguish them from pure whites,
and to see millions of people endors
ing social equality, as they invariably
did when they cast their ballots for
W. J. 8., I throw up my hands in
horror and exclaim, “Oh, God!
What will be their future?” The
conditions that surround us should
touch a responsive chord in every
parental heart, shoiffd raise such a
tempest of protest as would shake
the four corners of the earth. My
dear countrymen, do you believe that
those cannibal negroes in the jungles
of Africa are the equals of that dear
mother that gave you birth, upon
whose fair brow is stamped the image
and likeness of her God? You say
no. Well, why do you teach it? Are
the negroes in our country better
than their ancestors in Africa? No.
Not as good. Well, why do you prac
tice social equality? Oh, consistency,
thou art a jewel!
Yours for white supremacy,
Joseph M. Milleson.
ON THE FIRING LINE SINCE 1876.
R. F. D. No. 2, Willard, Mo.
Mr. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: Please find post-office
money order for two dollars for which
send me your two Jeffersonians for
the time this will pay for them, as I
can’t keep house without them. Have
been on the firing line since 1876;
previous to that time voted with the
Democrats, and one sin I will not
have to answer for, I have never voted
for Bryan.
Yours respectfully,
John T. Greenwade,
FROM A SOCIALIST.

tions as before.
I am a Socialist, but love to read

from the pen of a man who has the
courage of his convictions, and I find
plenty of such in your magazine and
weekly.
Yours truly, *
Frank L. Crosby.
Mr. Watson’s leading editorial in
the May number of the Jeffersonian

MISSES MISSOURI WORLD.
Aspin Hill, Tenn, Route 2.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My dear Sir: Having been a sub
scriber from the first issue of your
magazine, and a rpid-roader, and the
Jeffersonian
only one who voted for you at Elkton,
I thought I would write to you.
Many of the Democrats boldly af
firm that they will vote with me next
time. Everything seems to be coming
our way now. Hope to see our forces
organized soon and everything ready
for a united move to victory.
Am so sorry to lose the Missouri
World. I am one of a thousand who
will give five dollars to reinstate it.
Hope it will come again.
Well, as my subscription will ex
pire with this month, I will send you
a P. 0. order for two dollars, for
which send me your weekly and maga
zine.
As ever your yoke-fellow for the
cause of humanity,
N. B. Cobb.
THINKS MISSIONARIES HAVE
SOFT SNAPS.
Martinsville, Va.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My dear Sir: I have been reading
with great pleasure your article in
the April number of your Jeffersonian
on the subject of Foreign Mission. I
have not believed in foreign missions
for many years, nor have I given this
cause any support because I believed
the most of the money never reached
the people for whom it was intended
and that a great many men who were
too lazy to work at any constant and
legitimate occupation were using this
as a “ stalking horse ’ ’ to get soft
positions and live in comparative ease
without labor.
You, in your article, gave me con
siderable information, and I thank
you very much indeed for it.
Very truly yours,
William M. Peyton...
A LETTER TO A SENATOR ON
THE MONEY QUESTION.
Hucal, Texas.
Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: Please find enclosed copy
of a letter written by me to the Hon.
Charles A. Culberson. Please publish
in weekly Jeffersonian at your earliest
convenience.
Respectfully yours,
F. S. Taylor.
The Hon. Charles A. Culberson,
Washington, D. C.,
Dear Sir: I think it nothing amiss
for me to write you concerning our
money system. You are in a position
to make a record in defense of Gov
ernment legal tender money—the
money of the Constitution that every
Senator and Congressman took an
oath that he would uphold. We see
that old Hazzard, through his agents,
is still getting in his dirty work by
recommending the retirement of the
remaining greenbacks, and the melting
of the silver dollar. In his circular
Hazzard said, “It will not do to
allow the greenback, so-called, to
circulate as money for any length of
time, for we can not control that.”
Consequently, they want the green
backs destroyed yet. They can not
control them. Under the ruling of
the political leaders, the Hazzard
circular has become the financial
policy of the nation.
On Dec. 4, 1866, E. G. Spalding, a
Buffalo, N. Y., banker, a member of
Congress, wrote to Secretary Mc-
Culloch as follows: “You, no doubt,
now, to a certain extent, have control
of the currency of the country, and
I think you will of necessity contract
moderately so as to preserve a toler
able easy money market. There may
be occasional spasms or tightness for
money, but generally I shall look for
plenty of money for at least one year
to come.”
When this letter was written the
country was in possession of $1,906,-
687,770 currency.
In 1867, the work of contraction
was vigorously pushed, and there were
$473,000,000 of money cremated, and
produced 2,608 business' failures. In
1867, $500,000,000 of money was
destroyed. In 1870, $67,000,000, and
down to 1875, when contraction
brought about by cremation and other
wise to the amount of more than
$1,258,000,000, and I suppose that you
remember the distressing times that
it brought about.
Now, why allow the remaining
greenbacks to be destroyed? Why not
create more, and destroy the power
of the banks to control the finance of
the nation, thereby controlling the
price of labor and product? We will
watch for your record on the subject.
F. S. Taylor,
Vice-president U. iS. Monetary League.
United States Senate,
Washington, D. C.
Mr. F. S. Taylor, Route No. 1, Walnut
Springs, Texas,
Dear Sir: I write to acknowledge
receipt of your letter of the ninth
instant, and to assure you that your
suggestions shall have my careful at
tention and consideration. Just now
I can not go into the subject in a
letter, because I am extremely busy
with matters which I can not post
pone.
Very truly yours,
C. A. Culberson.
If you will help us, we’ll make the
weekly and the magazine bigger and
better. Don’t let a chance get by you
to secure a new subscriber.
WILL STAND ON POPULIST PLAT
FORM UNTIL THE LAST
HOPE IS GONE.
Daingerfield, Texas.
Hon Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: Please bear with me a
little, while I tell you a few things
concerning my life. I am in my 74th
year, was born in Talbot County, Ga.,
but was principally raised in Chatta
hoochee County, near Cusseta, Ga. In
April, 1862, I was mustered in Com
pany G, 31st Ga. Reg., under Col.
Clement A. Evans, now general in
command of U. C. V. I was wounded
at Coal Harbor during the seven
days’ fight around Richmond, came
home a cripple, and am one yet, but
as soon as able I was put on detail
service and was in discharge of my
duty when the Civil War closed. I
voted for Bill and Everett for Presi
dent and Vice-president. I voted
against secession, but when my coun
try went I went with it. I have voted
for two Democratic Presidents only
since the war, First Samuel J. Tilden,
second old Grover Cleveland, for
which I am sorry to this day.
I was so proud when the Populist
