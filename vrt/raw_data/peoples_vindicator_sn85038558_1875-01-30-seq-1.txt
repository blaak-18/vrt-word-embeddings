"Respect the Burden, Madame.'"
(Words of Napoleon the Great.)
BY ISAAC N. MAYNARD.
I.
Respect the burden, :on the 'shoulder
borne
Of Ihonest labor, toiling, oft careworo;
Ye know not. when an ever-changing fate
May doom o'en monarchs to that b'rden'd
state.
II.
Respect the burden, crushing down the
heart.
And lift it 'hence. 0, act an angel's part,
At least divide it,; take at share thyself,
Though it should cost thee gold. Right's
more than pelf
III
Respect the burden of the poor man's
song,
It pealeth even heaven's blue.arch along;
Feel for the poor, they're ever by thy sidt'
With bnrden'd hearts, sad ceommiut on
thy pride.
iV.
Respect the lbrden of you orphan's cry,
'Tis hallowed-sacred as as anigel si h.
The widow's moanl 0,, what a btrden
there
O'erwhelming grief, perchance neglect,
despair.
'V..
Respect the burden, wheresoe'er ye go,'
The heart bow'd down, filom whence pure
fountains flow,
And rising, speak; 'mnore eloquent than
tongue .
Of stateswan. grand or poet ever sung.
VI.
Rlespect the burden! 'tis the cross ' e
h 'bears-
Our Savinur bore it, 'antd each pang lie
shares.
We're born to labor, sorrow, grief, the
tear, , '
While traveling homeward to you Hoqy
en so dear!

Grand Prelate of t!.e Grand Encamp. q

high compliluent to the ,patience. of v
our people, in a letter at his' hoie in v
New London, Ct., under date 'of the t
6th inst.: i
I am anxious to hear from New Or
leans, especially as I see by a two t
column telegram in the Tribuue last t
night that the tight has comlnmeilced in t
your Legislature. It seems to mie a
queer phase in a republican govern
ielut when sohliers of the regular art
myi are called upon to decide who are
elhcted and who are not. If the peo
ple ot4ouisiana patiently submit to I
these proceedings, they are surely I
saiuts above all other people of this I
or any other age,' and iave brit a1
triflet iire to bear of the salme birt I
to distanee the patience of Job. and
the meekneiatpof Moses past ll com- .
petition. Net perhaps it is best that.
they should bear yet a little longer,
thiat their redemltion may"cotne in a
peaceful way,'as it!nurely will.
. Robert H. MOtrison, Esq., a promi- i
pent business man of. Sturgis,, Mich., I
who was alo ,.present. during the
Grand Encarmpiment, writes, under
dateof the 5th inst., as follows:

We can not add anything to the le- T
marks of the New York Tribune of
the 16th, upon the report of the Con
gressioual committee. We submit it
without comments:
THE N.EW OIRLEAES REPORT.
When Messrs. Foster, Phelps and
Potter were appointed a sub-commiit- te
tee to visit New Orleans and report iii
upon the true state of affairs' in on- p
isiana, the whole country was satis- .a
fled; It would have been hard to se
lect three members of the House of fo
Reprrsentatives who c o m in a n d e d t
more of the respect and contidence of j
all 'parties.: They are gentlemen of B
marked ability, of unimpeachable up- w
rightness and of recognized standing de
in the political organizations to which
they belong. 5f
There was no danger that before ti
such a committee eiqher side would se
fail of an opportunity to. present its
whole case. The sub-committee
worked hard, took a vast amount of S
testimony, listen to counsel-one for ,
the Conservative and three for the ah
Kellogg side-and held aloof front
all social entertainments which might
be supposed to warp their judgement. di
They inquired canrefully into the ns pi
tore of the White League, the man- n
agement of the recent election, the
stories of intimidation and coercion, ai
and the proceedings of the Returning w
. Board, and..they were Sye-witnesses ie
of the transactions of the 4th of Jan
ualry,.
When they presented their report to t
the full committee by which they hald "
been deputed to visit the South, they c;
e were found to be all of one' mind. i
Unanimous reports, in political inves
tigatioi4, are alhnoot unprecedented ;
but here the case eas clear that these
thiee hoeest gentlemen could not
differ in their verdict., .They told the -
committee that they had been no il- to
Stimidatieui of the colored voters last it
Novemnber ; that " the election had
.been 'conducted with'remarkable fair- ti
e uess ; that the Conservatives un
questionably had a large majority; t;
and int the aciiou'n of the Returning 11
ýl Board lhad: been outrageous. They h
iI added that the stories . of oppreasion S
g and lawlessness by the White League v
if were fictions, ..bthat organization of
n which Gen. Grant believes such awful i
e things )ring perfectly harmless and .s
lholding its meetings with Open doors. n
The full committee spent, four or II
o five days trying to force Messrs. Fos.
t ter, Phelps and Potter to take back c
1 their report, and, unable to prevail i
a upon them, attempted to suppress it. t
- N;o,w, it is said, Messrs. G. F. Hoar, e
Frye and' Wheeler propose going to 1
e New Orleans to see what kind of fist in
they can make of the affair, and to 1
:0 present, if possible, a' report more I
Sfavorable to thie Administration. Are' t
is they really sillule enouge to imagine
a that they will do their" arty any
rt' good by such a course '! a
,d 'hbeyý : start upon', their trip fore.
._ doomed to fall.: In . effect, they de- P
t. clare to their political associates:
r, "These three gentlemen. have.report- I
a ed the wrong way and told some on- a
pleasant truths, and now we -are go- .
i. ingoFosee, if it is really .oqt of the 1
I, questian to make a more favorable t
t showing for the Republican party I
ar thad'tley hate found it inthleir con- e
science to make." 'If the .Hoar re- 1
e por then, should differ fromn the i
I Foster eport, which will men pelieve ?

Washingson, JS;. 10.-The Uinited a
States has decided to ancept the pro- ill
position made by Spain f'r the pay- gh
ment of indemnity for citizens execn- al
ted in the 'irgiiius alfair, aud a oil- li
ilication of the ternms of payimelit pro- 0o
- posed by Spain is expected at an 1l
early day. The claim of Enghl; d p
was settled by the payment of .£510 i t
for each white British sulbject execull
ted and £3t00) for eacth colored mi.ut- or
f ject. The tota:l payment to Great it,
Bi itain amounted to £7000. and it1 p
was promptly paid, although this was 11
denied at the time. The samie pro- i
position was lmade to tthe Unitd ri
States, but declined upon the grounldl
that our governmenlt would not conl- l
1 sent to aiyu discriminationi in tatis of 1i
pay on account of color, and it is ex- di
pected at the State 1)Departm enl t that w
Spain will at anl ear'ly day propose a ft
r new rate which shall be the saule for' s
B all classes of citizens executed. o
