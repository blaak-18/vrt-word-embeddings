FISH
Drop us a card, and we will put
you on to something, with which you
can turn your neighbors green with
envy, by catching dead loads of fish,
where they have become disgusted
trying to catch them in the old
fashioned way. It is inexpensive,
and will only cost you a postal card
to find out what we say is true. Now
is the season for all varieties of cat
fish and suckers, and with our meth
and some to sell or give away.

Jeffersonian Club News
WANTED! ORGANIZERS!
By Will H. Stanford, National Organ
izer Junior Jeffersonian Clubs.
As is probably known by most of
you, we are attempting to organize
the young men into Junior Jefferson
ian (Reform) Clubs, for the purpose
of studying and debating all reform
movements, national and local.
I am satisfied that there are thou
sands of young men (of ages 16 to
25) who are anxious to join such an
organization, but there is a scarce
ness in young men who are willing to
take matters in hand and organize a
local branch of clubs.
We are very anxious to get organ
ized all over the Union at an early
date among young men of all politi
cal parties (we are fighting for re
form, not for any special political
party).
A young man could do himself, his
friends or his nation no greater fa
vor than by beginning today and or
ganizing a branch of Junior Jeffer
sonian Clubs in his county, town or
district.
Organizer’s Pledge.
I hereby pledge myself to begin at
once in an attempt to organize the
young people of my
(county, town or district) into a local
branch of Junior Jeffersonian Clubs.
Name. Place. State.
When writing if you desire a re
ply please send a stamped envelope.
Address all communications to
Junior Jeffersonian Clubs, Will N.
Stanford, National Organizer, Oxford,
Ga.
All county or local papers copying
will please send us copy.
NEWS OF THE MOVEMENT.
Mr. J. J. Brown, our State man
ager, reports that he orgnized a
strong Jeffersonian Club at Fellow
ship Academy, in Hart county, Ga.,
last week. Reports as to the offi
cers and membership will be pub
lished later.
Our club buttons will be received
this week, and distributed as soon as
possible to secretaries of clubs who
make application for them. Mem
bers of local clubs and of the Na
tional League are strongly urged to
wear these buttons as an outward
and visible sign of the Reform
spirit.
Meeting For Appling County.
Arrangements are being made for
a large meeting to be held at Bax
ley, Ga., on Wednesday, December
Ist, to organize a Jeffersonian Club
for Appling county. Several prom
inent speakers are expected to be
present.
PROTESTS!
(CONCLUDED FROM PAGE TWO)
Union No. 1604, hereby enters its sol
emn protest in the following resolu
tions: >
Resolved first, That said pernici
ous doctrines and the advocacy of
them is detrimental to the farming
interest of America, contrary to the
constitution of our beloved organiza
tion, and if indorsed by our officials
may be the death-knell to Unionism
throughout the South.
Resolved second, That our State
Ghe Jeffersonian
officials notify the public through
the columns of the “Union News”
that said “News” is not the official
organ or mouthpiece of the Farmers’
Educational and Co-operative Union,
but a private enterprise.
Resolved third, That all lecturers
sent out from headquarters be re
strained from giving said “Union
News” quasi indorsement by can
vassing for subscriptions thereto.
Resolved fourth, Inasmuch as the
editor and advocate of these pernici
ous measures is the chairman of our
National Legislative Committee, we
request the National Executive Com
mittee of the F. E. C. U. of A. to re
pudiate his action.
Resolved fifth, That we respect
fully ask the “Union News” to an
swer questions asked by The Jeffer
sonian of November 11th, page 12.
We think this request is fair and
will not hit the “News” below the
belt. This is in justice to the public
and to our laws to know the facts in
this matter.
Resolved sixth, That if the “Un
ion News” is not our and
not absolutely in line with the Union
and its cause, why not fly to The
Jeffersonian, a paper that has been
for the farmers from start to finish,
and can see the man in the moon.

NO. 8585 —LADIES’ WAIST.
A very charming waist made after
this model was developed from
brown rajah silk, with yoke and
sleeve puffs embroidered in floss of
the same color. The free edges of
waist and sleeve caps were trimmed
in irregular outline, with soutache
braid of a darker shade of brown.
The waist closes at the side, the
yoke being fastened underneath at
the back. The pattern is cut in 5
sizes, 32-34-36-38-40 inches bust
measures. It requires 4 3-4 yards of
22-inch material for this 36-inch
size.
A pattern of this illustration
sent to any address on receipt of 10
cents in stamps or silver.
