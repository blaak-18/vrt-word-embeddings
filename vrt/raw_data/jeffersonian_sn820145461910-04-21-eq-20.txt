SAY OF OTHER EDITORS
Tom Watson will soon begin a se
ries of articles in his Magazine that
will give the Roman Catholic church
the worst shaking up it ever had. But
few men, indeed, with Watson’s
ability, have ever felt willing to at
tempt such a thing. We expect to
watch this thing with the keenest in
terest. We belive every liberty lov
ing man and woman should do the
same.—Universalist Herald, Canon,
Ga.
People out in the rural districts
are beginning to wonder what it is to
be indicted. The tobacco trust is in
dicted: the sugar trust is indicted;
the standard oil is indicted; the
packers are indicted; the Guggen
heims are in a fairway to be indicted,
and now the milk trust in New York
is indicted.
After investigating the milk trust
for several weeks, the grand jury
handed down what is called a blanket
indictment, arraigning the Consoli
dated Milk Exchange, and charging
the people coinposing this so-called
exchange with having met in New
York June 29, 1 909, and “conspired
together and with others to fix the
price of milk, and did fix it at $1.41
for a 40-quart can of milk.’’ That
would be a little more than three and
a half cents a quart." But what did
they “conspire” to make the price to
the consumers?
The thing that confuses the coun
try people as to what it means to be
indicted is, that all these indicted
concerns are “still doing business at
the old stand.—-Up-to-Date Farming,
Indianapolis, Ind.
American tourists in Europe, if
they mention the small standing ar
my of the United States to a German,
Austrian, French or Italian officer,
will meet with the reply, “You have
a very small army, it is true, but a
very large pension list, and your pen
sion list is more expensive than any
army in Europe.” “It is forty-five
years since the war ended, and yet
the cost of it climbs steadily. In
1870 the Government paid to pen
sioners $27,780,811; in 1880, $57,-
240,540; in 1890, $106,493,890; in
1900, $1 39,381,522, and in 1909,
$1 61,973,703.” President Grant and
President Garfield were both in favor
of reducing the pension appropria
tions. President Grant in a. message
io Congress held that thirty millions
was too much. When Garfield was
in Congress and chairman of the ap
propriations committee he apologized
for a thirty-million appropriation
bill and pledged that it would not
again reach that amount. Then the
pension arrears bill was brought in

Mail this, with $1.25, to The Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga.
by a subsequent Congress, and thus
the appropriation has been increased
from less than thirty millions in 1870
to 162 millions in round numbers in

We are told that Taft’s adminis
tration is planning “the most far
reaching campaign against trusts
ever known.” Roosevelt carried on
this same campaign for seven years,
but the trusts are still with us, big
ger and stronger than ever, and more
numerous. The trusts will continue
to do business at the same old stand
until the people get sense enough
into their heads to put a political
party in power whose leaders in Con
gress are not millionaire stockholders
in trust organizations. County
News, Carthage, Tenn.
The Democrat does not believe in
bad nominations because it may re
sult in partisan advantage. If both
parties put up their best men, the
contest becomes one of principles
and policies, putting the game of
politics on a high plane which will
ultimately produce the best results
for the nation. The appalling evils
of government that curse and afflict
the nation today are the direct fruits
of elevating bad and weak men to
office.—Western Reserve Democrat,
Warren, O.
The Hon. Leslie M. Shaw is sure
there will be war with Japan. But
this is the same Shaw, who, as Secre
tary of the Trueasury, ruled that
frogs legs were poultry.—Advocate,

Every day that Joe Cannon holds
his chair as boss of tho House of
Representatives adds another insult
to the people of the United States,
'the reform forces have shown what
they can do and the question now is,
why don’t they.—Pittsburg (Kan.)

Congressman McKinley who was
sent to Kansas by the stand-patters
at the instance of President Taft,
with his tongue lubricated with the
oil of the wily trust king came too
early. At any rate he met a frost
wherever he went. The six Rhode
Island Congressmen from this State,
whose bacon McKinley was sent out
here to save, may rest assured that
they have made a water haul. This
is not a propitious time to bring
about an amalgamation between the
Aldrich-Cannon idea and the free, in
dependent Kansas sentiment. It is
said McKinley never produced a rip-
C?be Teff&rsonlan.
pie of enthusiasm only when he acci
dentally mentioned Roosevelt. The
most eloquent peroration leading up
to the mention of President Taft
would only produce an effect like
throwing a wet blanket over a shiver
ing child.—News-Chronicle, Scott
City, Kan.
The Chicago Tribune has polled
the editors of the entire country.
First they tried the editors of the
Middle West and found that even the
Republican editors were overwhelm
ingly against Cannon, Aldrich, Taft
and the Payne tariff bill. Next they
try the New England States and find
the same result. That result coupled
with the election of a Democrat in
Massachusetts (in the face of a nor
mal Republican majority of 1 4,000)
has given the bosses shivers. The
election was to fill a vacancy caused
by the death of a Republican Con
gressman. The people are really
waking up.—Soo Critic, Sioux Falls,
S. Dak.
At this writing, March 29, 1910, it
looks as if Billy Bryan and Sarney
Gompers are attempting to organize
a “mutual admiration party” for
their own mutual aspirations. We
should like to see Billy Bryan and
Samey Gompers nominated for Presi
dent and Vice-President on one
ticket, and Theodore Roosevelt and
Tom Watson for President and Vice-
President on another. This would
be an educational event of great
benefit, as it would be a test of im
portance demonstrating, as it would,
the standard of the public mind in
its esteem of “two cunning politi
cians” and “two great statesmen.” —
