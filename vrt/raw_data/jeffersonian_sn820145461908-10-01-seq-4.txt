CHAIRMAN HOLLAWAY AP
PEALS TO GEORGIANS.
Now is the Time to Act—Bryan Third
in Race.
«k>
It is found by actual enrollment
that Watson has about 8 votes to* ev
ery one for Bryan, and that Taft has
more than Bryan, at this precinct.
Your humble scribe was invited to
give a talk at Banning Saturday and
it is found that this district is about
three to one for our ticket.
The enrollment plan is encouraging
our boys wherever it is being pushed,
for it reveals to them the fact that
many arc with us who have not been
heretofore. It also shows that Mr.
Bryan is not as strong as the Demo
cratic dailies would have us believe.
Therefore we cannot too strongly
urge the Populists of Georgia to push
this work of organization. Each en
rollment blank contains lines for 25
names, giving the county, district,
postoffice, route number and a column
for the amount the signer wishes to
contribute for printing of tickets,
blanks and other expenses of the cam
paign.
In 1904 we had 300,000 tickets
printed, but not having the addresses
of Populists in each precinct, many
tickets fell into unfriendly hands and
were purposely kept from the polls
so that many who wanted to vote for
Mr. Watson, failed to vote. Hence
the small vote of 1904.
Surely no informed, p i son believes
that Mr. Watson polled even half
his strength in that campaign; our
unorganized condition and the fact
above recited were the principal rea
sons. But with the help of the Jef
fersonians, and the enrollment blanks,
there is no reason why we should not
expect a full vote the third of Novem
ber, provided our boys are registered.
This reminds us of the fact that there
will be only six days in which one can
register between October election and
the November election, because the
law’ requires the books closed 20 days
before each legal election.
KT rwi'E in wv r
[on. Thos. E. Watson
WILL MAKE ADDRESSES AT THE FOLLOWING POINTS:
WARRENTON, GA., October 5. STATESBORO, GA., Oct. 14.
LAWRENCEVILLE, GA., Sept. 30. STILLMORE, GA., Oct. 15.
JACKSON, GA., Oct. 1. s . DUBLIN, GA., Oct. 16.
EASTMAN, GA., Oct. 2. Speaking At All Places Begins At 10 A M
ATLANTA, GA. (at night), Cct. 7. MONTEZUMA, GA., October 20.
LITHONIA, GA., Oct. 8. ARLINGTON, GA., October 21.
GAINESVILLE, GA., Oct. 9. THOMASVILLE, GA., October 22.
| SYLVANIA, GA., Oct. 13. LUDOWICI, GA., October 23.
A regular schedule of Mr. Watson’s speeches will be printed in the Jes- I
fersonian during the campaign, and every voter in Georgia will be in ven nn I
| opportunity to hear him. s I
I am informed that the registra
tion is very light in some counties.
Do not think for a moment that
the heavy vote in the June primary
meant that they were registered vot
ers, for the county committees in
many counties disregarded the regis
tration list, as was done in this coun
ty, but it cannot be done in a legal
election. Therefore a hint to the wise
is sufficient. Get a move on you,
comrades. It is getting near time to
print and mail out tickets and no
campaign funds to meet‘expenses.
Many have written for blanks, but
forgot to enclose even a 2-cent stamp.
A record will be kept of every penny
contributed and for what used, open
to the inspection of Populists at all
times. Ten or fifteen cents apiece
from half the Populists of Georgia
would enable us to keep a force at
headquarters in Atlanta and get out
all the literature and tickets needed,
and to answer all inquiries and put
many more speakers in the field.
Comrades, is it worth the while,
or shall we sit idly by and let Mr.
Watson and a few others bear all the
expense and burden of the campaign?
As we have no trusts and corpora
tions to finance our campaign, w r e do
not feel that it is necessary to do as
Mr. Bryan has done —give out notice
that we will not receive any sum
greater than SIO,OOO from one con
tributor.
But I wish to say in conclusion
and finally, that in this day of Amer
ican polities, while both old parties
are being absolutely run by the great
trusts and corporations, there is cer
tainly no way for us to lead a suc
cessful campaign against them with
out somebody being out some time
and money.
Is liberty worth the price?
If so, shoot, Luke, or give up your
gun.
Yours for the fray,
J. J. HOLLAWAY.
