TOM WATSON MELON—72-tb.
The very best and most attractive melon ever
put on the market, it is long and dark green
in color, and its eating quality has no supe
rior, it keeps longer than any other melon after
ripening, and is one of the best shipping mel
ons grown; it will make more money for those
who plant it than any other.
I planted a few acres of very thin land last
season to supply my home trade, and t© se
cure more seed for the growing demand, and
to my surprise I not only made all the melons
for this purpose, but sold five car loads that
brought me $450.
Read what Mr. P. B. Sharp, of Oklahoma,
says of them: “I received the package of
seed in due time, and planted them rather late
in season, and hardly cultivated them at all,
but they grew a very fine crop of melons, the
finest that I ever saw in the Simerion Valley
this season, will plant no ether next season,
as I consider this all that is desired in a
watermelon.”
I have a few seed from this wonderful melon,
to offer to the growers at $1.35 per pound, five
pounds for $6.50, express prepaid. Address

The Hocus Pocus Money Book”
Published in 1904, showed that existing condi
tions made a commercial panic in the near
future inevitable—and why? Its 200 pages are
filled with incontrovertible economic principles
** and astonishing facts, sustained by figures from
the U. S. Comptroller’s Reports, and bank or
gans, proving that the deposit banking system
—as it has been maneged in the past —is the
real cause of every commercial panic ever
known, and most of the periods of business de
pression that have afflicted this country. And,
what is still more important, it shows how their
recurrence can be made impossible—and the de
mand for services and products made to always
equal the supply —without wronging any one, or
costing the people a dollar. Book sellers and
news dealers can not afford to antagonize the
banks by handling this book. Do not blame
them—but send for the book yourself. Terms,
by mail: Single copy, 25 cents,. 5 for sl. Ad
