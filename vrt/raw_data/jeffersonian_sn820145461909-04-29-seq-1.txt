THE LONELY LITTLE BOY.
The little boy whom you forget
To play with when the days are
fair,
The child whose hopes are sinless yet,
Who kneels to lisp his evening
prayer,
Will soon leave off his childish ways
And learn the things that men must
learn;
Why do you waste the precious days
That never, never can return 1 ?
You never lead him by the hand,
Nor make his little joys your own;
Ambition sends you her commands,
And he is left to play alone;
He never climbs upon your knee
Delighted at the long day’s end,
To find that you have time to be
His fond and sympathetic friend.
You can never affi rd to waste
A precious hour amusing him;
The prizes after which you haste
Are always far away and dim;
You must ever be pressing on,
Forgetting, while you strive any!
plan,
How soon his childhood will be gone,
How quickly he will be a man.
You never pause with him to hear
The breeze that sings among the
reeds, e
You have no time to give the dear,
Sweet sympathy for which he
pleads;
You never rush with him in wild
Pursuit of fairies through the glen,
Yourself again a careless child,
Freed from the cares that worry
men.
Have you no treasured memories
Os one who gladly played with you,
Before you had been robbed of ease,
And when your cares were small
and few?
Ah, will you rob him of the joy
Os looking back along the years
When he has ceased to be a boy
And Duty’s call rings in his ears?
The little boy whom you forget
To play with when the days are
fair, \
The child whose thoughts are sinless
yet,
Who kneels to lisp his evening
prayer,
Will soon leave off his childish ways,
And you will sit somewhere alone
Regretting precious wasted days
And joys that might have beon your
own.

ADMIRAL CERVERA.
The death of Admiral Cervera,
which occurred a few days ago, at
tracted comparatively little attention
among the younger generation. Doubt
less a good many people in this coun
try had to stop and ask themselves
who w</ Cervera? Few braver men
have lived in the last century. But
he was a loser.
It has been eleven years since the
little Spanish fleet left its native
shores never to return. Many of the
officers and men were killed or
drowned in the engagement with an
overwhelming force, many were
wounded and comparatively few
escaped unhurt. Admiral Cervera
must have known that he was going
to his doom. But he never shirked
his duty. His was a hopeless cause
from the beginning. No one knew it
better than he. With a fleet of four
fighting ships and three smaller crafts,
all poorly equipped and no matches
for the powerful armada he encoun
tered in Santiago harbor, he faced
the heavy odds courageously and made
the best of a hopeless cause.
His fleet was shot to splinters in
the battle that went into history to
mark the abolition of Spanish suze
ranity in the Western world. It was a
bitter sorrow to a proud man vainly
striving to uphold the military honor
of a proud nation. And yet he did
all that was in the power of mortal
man to do under the circumstances,
and the splendid way in which this
splendid gentleman conducted himself
pending the peace treaty and after he
returned to his native land was the
source of admiration to the rest of the
world.
While a prisoner of a hostile coun
try Admiral Cervera was treated with
every consideration, and many honors
were tendered him when he was being
held in captivity by the people of the
United States. He had represented
the Spanish government at Washing
ton and made many friends at the
national capital. He was a good
soldier, a man of courage and of
honor.
To give some idea of the spirit of
the man, when he was a prisoner at
Annapolis several dinners were given
in his honor. At one of these an
officer in the American navy said to
him:
“Admiral, what one thing struck
you more forcibly than any other at
the battle of Santiago?”
The distinguished prisoner smiled
and replied: “I think it was that
eight-inch shell from the Oregon that
raked my ship from stem to stern.”
A man who could give such a reply
under the circumstances, and in the
best of humor, was naturally a favor
ite among the naval men with whom

he came in contact. Among the warm
est tributes paid the skill and courage
of Admiral Cervera was the one that
came from Admiral Schley.—’Birming

HYPOCRITICAL REVISIoif
“Don’t tax necessaries of life,”
shouts our Dingley contemporary, The
Press. The Payne bill proposition to
put a tax on tea and coffee has raised
such an instant shriek of “Ouch!”
throughout the country that the pro
tectionist revisers have taken to the
woods. The Press goes along. It is
the policy of the patty In power to
get a billion dollars annually out of the
pockets of tax-payers as tar as pos
sible by indirection. Taxes laid on
tea and coffee would be instantly
recognized and resented. Yet the tax
on sugar, that bears harder on the
breakfast table; the tax on woolens,
stockings, gloves, shoes, oil, lumber,
paper and other necessaries of living,
that go mainly to feed the trusts with
out easing the burden of government,
raise no remorseful scruples in the
breasts of our tariff revisers. Their
money is at stake in these forms of
legalized pillage. Out on such hy
pocrisy ! —Philadelphia Record.
NATIONAL BANKS.
The “Money Question” is getting
interesting and important. Who can
understand the disposition of the peo
ple to act so stupidly in such a vital
matter, as Tom Watson shows in his
article on “National Banks”? Can
we believe that an intelligent people,
who are also honest, will allow a
certain class of individuals to reap
such profits, without protesting
against it? But simply protesting
will do little good, if no practical
measures are taken to effect a change.
This system of legalized robbery has
been growing up ever since the Civil
War. The “Republican” party was
the sire of it; and the “Democratic”
party has been so completely emascu
lated by its Tammany Hall and Wall
Street elements, associated with the
“Bourbons” of the South, that it has
been incapable of offering any effec
tive oppositon to this system of spolia
tion; and the Populist party was so
unwise and unfortunate as to make an
alliance with this moribund “Democ
racy,” at a critical juncture; and now
a tew brave and uncorrupted men
must lead the blinded people out of
this wilderness of woe. American
Whip.
THE GOOD CAN WAIT.
The person whose work counts and
bears the best and most lasting fruit,
is he who works for the right.
Men are often misunderstood and
repudiated by the generations with
which they live. But if their deeds
have been righteous and their pur
poses altruistic, justice will ultimate
ly award the meads of praise.
Cicero said: ‘ * The diligent farmer
plants trees of which he, himself will
never see the fruits.”
The only compensation he receives
grows out of the consciousness that
he has done his duty and that others
will reap good from what he has
sown.
There is nothing so fickle as the
applause of the multitude.
I have known men to be the idol
of one day, and execrated the next.
Temporary success —ephemeral re
nown are too often bought at the
expense of the conscience and the
public good.
This would be a great old world
if all men were to follow the star of
Right—do their duty for duty’s sake,
and leave to time the settlement. —
