ia Cenms" with a WiRe.
In regard to first aid to the eleettle
ally shocked, the French minister of
publio works, under expert advice, has
prepared the following rules: The vie.
tim is to be, first of all, taken into an
airy place; thresor four persons should
be taken there to assist and no one else
allowed to enter. The clothing is to be
loosened and efforts made to reestab
lish respiration and circulation as soon
as possible. To reestablish respiration,
recourse can be had to. the following
two methods, viz., drawing of the
tongue and artificial respiration. In
the former case the mouth of the vic
tim is opened with the fngers, or, if
there be resistance, with a piece of
wood, the handle of a knife, spoon or
fork, or end of a walking stick. The
front part of the tongue should then be
taken between the thumb and index
finger of the right hand, bare or cov
ered with, say, a pocket handker
chief to prevent slipping. The
tongue is then strongly pulled,
and allowed to relax, in rhythmio
al imitation of respiration, at least
twenty times a minute. These move
ments must be continued without a
break for half an hour or more. For
artificial respiration the subject should
be laid upon his back, the shoulders
slightly raised, the mouth open and the
tongue free. The arms are taken at
the height of the elbows, support
ing them strongly on the walls of
the chest, next bringing them above
the head, describing the are of a
circle. These movements are to be
continued at least twenty times a min
ute until the re-establishment of nat
ural respiration. It is suitable to
commence with the movement of the
tongue as described, simultaneously, if
possible, with the adopting of artificial
respiration. At the same time it is de
sirable to try and restore circulation by
rubbing the surface of the body, by
beating the body with the hands or
with wet towels, throwing cold water
on the subject from time to time, and
applying ammonia or vinegar to the
nose.
SUBSTITUTES FOR GLASS.
Substances Employed on a Large Scale Ia
European Countries.
Substitutes for glass, employed in
Germany, furnish a topic for an inter
esting paper to be published by the de
partment of state.
One of these comes in sheets. 1-16th
of an inch thick, of tough and insoluble
gum, embedded in which is a web or
network of galvanized iron wire. The
gum is said to be bichromated gelatine.
The surface on each side is covered
with a varnish of boiled linseed oit.
The stuff is lighter than glass, tough,
pliant and practically indestructible by
hail or ordinary causes. It may be
bent into any desired form and fast
ened in position by nailing or with put
ty. It feels and smells somewhat like
the oil of silk used in surgery and -for
the sweat bands of summer hats.
This material is utilized to a consid
erable extent abroad for skylights, con
servatories and transparencies. It takes
the place of ground glass for windows
which are intended to admit light, but
not to be seen through. Some time ago
it was adopted for the roof windows of
the London aquarium, which have a
total area of 97,600 square feet. The
saving in this case has been large in
respect to breakage, which is apt to
be a very costly item of expense
where roof windows are concerned.
The stuff has a translucence like that
of opal glass. Its color Is a greenish
amber yellow, which fades gradually to
white by exposure to sun. It transmits
a soft light adapted to hothouses. It
takes oil paints well, and is used for
illuminated signs and transparencies.
Disadvantages are that it is inflam
mable and that in warm weather it
gathers dust. The latter, however1
may be washed or wiped cf!.
This substitute for glass costs ten
cents a square foot. It is sold in rolls
like carpet or oilcloth. It is utilized
only for private conservatories, owing
to its cost. For ordinary hotbeds and
forcing houses a far cheaper material is
widely used in Europe. In Germany
this is known as "fensterpappe." It
consists of nothing more nor less than
sheets of tough and strong manila pa
per stretched on sashes and frames, the
surface being painted with boiled lin
seed oil until the paper is translucent
and impervious to water. It costs 8l,1
cents a square yard; it is light, durable
and admits enough light for growing
plants. The fensterpappe is largely
utilized by florists and market garden
ers.
Bacterlology of the Sea.
Dr. B. Fischer, ,bacteriologist of the
1894 Plankton expedition, has just
finished his report on the "Microbes of
the Sea." He says that microbes cap
able of germination are everywhere to
be found in sea water except at great
depths. They are more numerous in
the Canary, Florida and Labrador
currents than they are in either the
Guinea or Equatorial currents. They
were not detected with certainty in the
ooze of the ocean's bed, but were aban
doned at all depths shallower than 1,800,
and some were found at a depth of 8,500
feet. Like the bacteria of the differ
ent diseases, those of the ocean are
found in all shapes and forms, the
spiral predominating. Nearly all were
found provideed with hooks or suckers,
and one large family are reported as
being phosphorescent.
We See All of the Sun.
The inhabitants of this earth never

plane of the ecliptic, the inclination
being only about seven degrees

sad we publish to-day his fuN report. The
Coulters are prominent people, though Mrs
C. in response to the question whether she
objected to being Interviewed, said: "Cer
tainly not." Her story follows:
"About 14yearsago we decided to take up
our abode in Dover and everything went
along smoothly for several years, business
progressed and being of a saving tempera
ment we aooamulatdA quite an amount.
Our family increased as the yepra rolled by
and we now have 5 children living, the old
eat 15. youngest 8, but sickness made its
way into our household, and doctors' bills
flooded upon us, until we have nothing left
but our home, and these sweet children.
Everything else went to satisfy the claims
of phyaicians.
of"Abont 8 years ago I had a miserable
fealing at the back of my ears, my right
hand became paralyzed and the paralysis ex
tended to my arm and throat, and would at
fect my head and eyes, sometimes for days
I would lose my sight, my face was de
formed, lifeless, as it were, my nose was
drawn to one side and I presented a piti
able apperance and never expecting tore
gain my natural facial expiessions. I em
ployed the best physicians that could be
procured, expending thousands of dollars
for their services but could not obtain re
lief. At last, they stated my case was be
yond the reach of medical skill, audit would
be but a short time until the end would
come. This certainly was not very encour
aging to me, but never gave up hope. In
connection with receiving the attendance of
physicians I have tried every medicine
known to the apothecary but never re
ceived any relief until Dr. Williams Pink
Pills for Pale People came to my assist
ance. Before I had taken half of the first
box the deformity in my face had left me,
and before four boxes had been consumed
the paralysis had disappeared entirely and
much to my surprise Ifelt like a new wom
an. I have not taken any medicine since
last spring, just about a year ago and my
trouble has not appeared since. I owe my
health, my life to Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.
"A short time since my little boy John
was afflicted with St. Vitus' dance. He
coulh. not walk across the room without as
sistance, in fact he would fall all pver him
mself but after taking a few boxes of Dr.
Wiiliams' Pink Pills St. Vitus' danceentire
ly left him, and no trate of the affliction is
left. These pills are worth their weight in
gold. You may say in this connection that
I am willing at any time to make affidavit
to the truth of these statements, and fur
thermore I will answer any communication
concerning my case, as I consider it noth
ing more than right and uast that I should
assist suffering humanity. '

WHEELS AND RIDERS.
Mn.. ELIZABETH CADY STANTON says
that "women are riding to suffrage on
a bicycle."
CHAPrnons who can ride bicycles are
in great demand in all of the large cit
ies of the country.
Docrons have declared that the heart
of Zimmerman, the famous bicycle
rider, is fully two inches longer than
the average size of hearts.
W. D. BACHELOR, of Cornell college,
Iowa, has gone on a trip, with two
companions, through Europe, Egypt
and Palestine on wheels. They expect
to pay expenses by corresponding with
papers, the three having a list of forty
seven.
C. F. PARDIroW was the first man
seen on a bicycle in Richmond, Va. He
visited his old home in Paris about 1871,
and brought a very tall wheel back
with him. A conservative estimate of
wheels in actual use in Richmond
would be two thousand.
REV. Mn. FAIRBANKS, an American
missionary in India, attributes a large
part of his success to the use of a
bicycle. Not only is he enabled to
cover a more extensive territory with
it. but the natural curiosity of the na
tives brings large crowds to see "a horse
that needs neither grass nor grain."
Ir women bicyclers will have the
saddle directly over the pedals and so
high that when the pedal is down the
foot must be bent to reach it, they will
make a much more graceful appear
ance. This will, of course, make
mounting somewhat more difficult, but
the objectionable knee action will be
less obtrusive.

CABBAGE-ROOT MAGGOT.
The. Be.t lMethel of ighting This
Troublesome Garden Pest.
Although called the aebbage-root
maggot, this insect will also feed on
the roots of cauliflower, borecole, Brus
sels sprouts, radish, collard, .brooeoli,.
rutabaga turnip, winter cress and
hedge mustard. Many remedies have
been recommended for this pest. The
only preventive that has proved ef
fectual on a large scale is the tarred
paper dise. These discs, which should
measure three inches in diameter, are
made of thin roofing felt, being cut by
a special tool, the dotted lines in the
diagram showing the position of the
edge of the tool. The discs should be
placed about the plants at the time of
transplanting. By bending the card
slightly the slit will open sufficiently to
admit the stem of the plant to the
center, after which the card should be
spread out, and the points formed by
the star-shaped cut should be pressed
snugly about the stem. It is essential
that the ground be smooth when the
cabbage plants are transplanted, and
the discs must be pressed close to
the ground, leaving no chance for the
flies to crawl under them.
As a preventive measure would only
cause the flies to abandon the cabbage
HOW TO CUT.
or cauliflower crops for some other
plant, the Geneva station recommends
that a direct remedy be used in con
tunction with it. Carbolic acid in the
form of an emulsion is the most feasi
ble. The proportions are, one pound
hard soap or one quart soft soap
dissolved in one gallon boiling water,
one pint crude carbolic acid; the
whole should be well churned to form
an emulsion, when thirty parts water
should be added to one of the mixture.
It should be applied in a solid stream.
When the maggots have worked their
way into the roots of the plant a short
distance the only remedy is carbon
bisulphide. This must be applied
carefully below the roots, and not on
them, as the liquid will kill all the
roots with which it comes in contact.
The requisite proportion is one tea
spoonful to each plant.-N. Y. WVorld.
NEW BORDEAUX MIXTURE.
Better Than the One Now to Largely
Used in This Country.
At a meeting of the National Agri
cultural society of France ;n improved
Bordeaux mixture was suggested with
the object of removing certain objec
tions to the one now so largely used in
this country. It has the advantage
over the old mixture in being less in
jurious to foliage, less liable to be
washed away by rains, and less liable
to choke the nozzle of the spraying
machine. The new formula is as fol
lows: Quicklime, 4 pounds 6 ounces;
molasses, 4 pounds 6 ounces; sulphate
of copper, 4 pounds 6 ounces; water, 22
gallons. The essential difference be.
tween the new andold formulas is the
presence of the molasses, which has a
greater influence than would at first be
expected. The method of mixing is to
add the molasses to thirteen gallons of
water, then slack the lime and add
four and one-half gallons of water to
form a milk of lime. Pour this slowly
into the sweetened water, stirring
briskly in order to mix intimately.
Next, in a third (wooden) vessel dis
solve the bluestone and pour this into
the previous mixture, stirring well.
In this blending of materials chemical
changes are taking place. When the
milk of lime and sweetened solution
are intimately mixed together. then
saccharate of lime is formed. Next,
when to this is added the solution of
sulphate of copper, a double decom
position takes place; suphate of lime is
formed on the one hand and soluble
saccharate of copper on the other.
This saccharate of copper is only
formed in presence of an excess of lime,
and its formation is indicated by the
mixture assuming a beautiful greenish
tinge. Thus the mixture is rendered
alkaline, and the acid is neutralized
by the lime.
HORTICULTURAL NOTES.
Fon the first few years in cultivating
an orchard it is advisable to plow deep
ly in the spring.
FnUxT is every year becoming more
plentiful, and the increased consump
tion keeps pace with the supply.
PRuwlxx of the peach should be donE
in a way to avoid crotches, but have
Sthe limbs extending from the trunk.
As enoors start up where no branches
are wanted pinch them off and leave
others where it is desired to have them
grow.
L cultivating your apple trees you
may raise corn in the orchard for a very
few years, provided you don't plant it
too hear the trees, andi will cut it up
and haul it out early in the winter,
and by no means make a shock around
a tree.
WHEwTER you plant yearlings or five
year-olds, they will be about the same
sims six or seven years after planting,
with the chances in favor of the young
er trees being the most firmly rooted.
But up to that time the older trees will
have paid decidedly the best.
ONE thing is certain, as a rule the
horticulturist lives a little better than
the average of men, as he always has
plenty of fruit and vegetables to eat.
He uses 400 to 500 loads of manure an
nually, and his grounds show it. His
soil is an excellent one naturally.
THE preservation of insectivorous
birds and all innoxious reptiles should
be insisted upon by county and town
governments, and a knowledge of the
principal forms of predaceous and can
nibal insects disseminated through the
public schools both of town and coun
ty.-Farmer's Voice.
Prttecting Melons from Cut-Worms.
Cut-worms have proved so destructive
to melons that growers are recom
mended hereafter to plow in the fall
--early rather than late--and leave the
land bare during the winter. Then, in
the early spring, as soon as the grass
begins to come up in adjoininK fields,
sprinkle here and there throughout
the field which is to be planted to mel
ons bunches of grass or any other green
vegetation which has previously been
poisoned by sprinkling with Paris
green in solution. Such of the cut
worms as may be present in the land
will feed upon this vegetation and will
be klilled. It will also have the efect
