WITNESS FOR PEDDY PROVES
. HELP TO SENATOR MAYFIELD
Tom F. Hunter, Lawyer and Oil Operator, Says It Is Com
mon Practice for Texas Attorneys to Raise Private
Funds for Candidates They Wish to Support.
Tells Senate Committee There Was No Connection Between Permit
Granted by Railroad Commission to Drill Well and $750 Contrib
uted to Campaign Expenses.
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C.. May 12 —Tom F. Hunter, an attorney and
an operator in the oil field, in the district surrounding Wichita
Falls, Texas, came to Washington to testify in the Mayfield case.
He was subpoenaed here by the attorneys for Mr. Peddy, but on
the witness stand he made a better witness for Senator Mayfield.
Mr. Hunter told of his friendship
for Senator Mayfield, that he had con
tributed money for the campaign but
that it was done without Senator
Mayfield’s knowledge or consent. He
said he had never paid any money di
rect to Mayfield, that he had talked
with J. L. Hunter about the Mayfield
candidacy for the senate and that he
had agreed to assist with the financ
ing of the campaign through Hunter.
He said there never had been a com
mittee named but that there was a
manager and an assistant manager of
the campaign.
Tom Hunter said that he had giv
en all told $750. but that $250 of the
amount was contributed by other
parties. He himself gave SSOO and
saw to it later on that the other $250
was paid. Answering the committee
Hunter said he never told Mayfield
what he had done in the way of help
ing financially.
Campaigns Not Mentioned
Mr. Hunter said that in November
1921 he had attended a hearing be
fore the Texas Railroad commission
at Austin trying to get an oil per
mit to drill one well on a narrow
atrip of land. At that time nothing
waa said about campaign contribu
tions. He also related how Earle B.
Mayfield, now Senator Mayfield, had
walked out of the hearing room and
had put his arms around T. P. Boone
and nimself and asked Hunter if
Boone was in line for his candidacy.
Mr. Hunter testified that there was
not the least connection between his
getting the oil permit and the sub
ject of campaign contributions, that
the subject was not even mentioned.
He said that he weot to Austin to
get a permit to drill three wells on
that strip of ground and got only one
well, just one-third of what he went
after. He related how he went home
from Austin to Wichita Falls, then
later to Sherman. Texas, to see Alli
son Mayfield, chairman of the Rail-

road commission, who was home sick
in bed. While there he persuaded Al
lison Mayfield to sign his permit for
one well, and later secured the sec
ond signature, as it was necessary to
gain the signatures of two out of
three members of the commission.
On Own Initiative
Mr. Peddy's attorneys tried their
best to get the witness to say that he
got his permit the same day he went
to Austin after it. but Hunter denied
this and explained to the committee
that he did not get it for several days
later, when it came to him by mail.
He denied showing his permit on the
train going home from Austin, be
cause he did not have it at the time
He also said that he went to see Al
lison Mayfield, chairman of the com
mission. on his own initiative, and
that Earle B. Mayfield had no knowl
edge or made no suggestion of any
such move on his part.
On cross examination, Mr. Hunter
said it was a common practice in
Texas for lawyers to get together,
raise a sum of money and help elect
men to office they wanted elected,
even to judges, because no candidate
could afford to bear all of his ex
penses. They just go ahead and han
dle the financing of such campaigns
without letting the candidate know
anything about it.
Witness said that he had support
ed Senator Mayfield for every race
he had ever made in his life.
G. Clint Wood Heard
G. Clint Wood, another oil producer
of Wichita Falls, Texas, said he had
met John G. Towns, of Houston, in
the campaign of 1922. When Towns
began to talk about raising money
for Senator Mayfield’s campaign, the
witness said:
“You’re not talking to me. I did
not support Mayfield in the first pri
mary and I’ll not contribute.”
In the run-off with Governor Fer
guson, Mr. Wood testified that he did
support Mayfield and that he con
tributed $25 to the local campaign
in his home town, saying that a lo
cal committee had hired a band, had
printing and advertising done, and
that he gave $25 to help out.
T. P. Boone Testifies
T. P. Boone, county attorney at
Wichita falls, on the stand said he
was acquainted with Tom F. Hunter.
He, too, sought a permit from the
Texas railroad commission in behalf
of the T. and P. railroad company to
drill a well or wells on the company’s
right-of-way at A exia, Texas. He
told about Mayfield talking to Tom
Hunter and himself about how he
(Boone) stood on his candidacy. He
said that Mayfield said Hunter was
one of his ardent supporters but noth
ing was said about campaign contri
butions.
The subcommittee then went into
executive session to determine about
how much hearsay testimony the com
mittee should permit being given,
objection having been made by the
Mayfield attorneys to so much of it
from Peddy witnesses. Up to date,
the Peddy people have not been able
to connect Senator Mayfield up with
large campaign contributions or with
having any knowledge of what his
Texas friends were doing in that line.
Witnesses have done a lot of talking
about big amounts being spent but
have been unable to show any facts to
date that substantiate it.

Injured Pennsylvania Klansman
Arrested Following Riot at Lilly
Charges of Murder, Carrying
Concealed Weapons, and
Riot Against Evans
(By S. THOMAS ZENER, Jr.)
PITTSBURGH, PA.. May 10.—The
* mercury in the mythical barom
eter of public feeling has climbed to
a high stage in Cambria county, Penn
sylvania, as the result of the unwar
ranted attack upon marching Klans
men at Lilly, Pennsylvania, Saturday
night, April 5, and was given added
impetus at Ebensburg late Friday,
when Judge John E. Evans “passed
the buck” to Warden Knee of the
county jail, on the plea of Klan coun
sel for the release of one of the
jailed men being held, to attend his
father’s funeral.
Godfred Greybeck, aged 69, father
of one of the jailed Klansmen, died
last Wednesday morning at his home
at Windber, from a complication of
diseases. Immediately upon hearing
of the aged man’s demise, Cambria
county Klansmen notified the four
attorneys representing the Klan in
this case, and they prepared a peti
tion to Judge Evans which was pre
sented to him late Friday. Judge
Evans procrastinated in the matter,
it is reported, and left the decision
to Warden Knee. Klansmen and oth
er interested Protestants could not
get into communication with Warden
Knee until late Friday, when he
agreed, however ,to take the jailed
man to his father’s funeral Saturday
afternoon at two o’clock.
Along with this apparent set-back,
came the arrest of Klansman Samuel
Evans, Thursday morning, in Memo

Congressman Issues
Statement About
Immigration
WASHINGTON, I). C., May 17.
Representative John L. Cable, of Ohio,
member of the House immigration
committee, has given out the follow
ing statement on the conference re
port on the immigration bill.
“The immigration question re
quires an American answer, namely,
no alien has a right to enter the
United States, nor can a foreign gov
ernment indicate or select its na
tionals who may come. The framers
of our constitution intended to place
exclusively in congress the power of
passing laws admitting or debarring
immigrants. The proposition that
congress shall request the president
to negotiate with the the Japanese
government in relation to the abro
gation of the ‘gentleman’s agreement’
is contrary to the principles and ide
als of this nation.
“Immigration is thoroughly a do
mestic problem. It should be consid
ered in the open without secret nego
tiations or diplomatic communica
tions. It is not a proper subject for
treaty regulations, because a treaty
is a contract ,and certain rights must
be surrendered for the benefits ex-
Sected to be obtained. The United
tates has nothing to concede in pass
ing an immigration measure.”
Junior Klan Records
Saved in Hotel Fire
GRAND RAPIDS. MICH.—In the
recent fire which destroyed the Liv
ingston hotel, resulting in the death
of six persons and injuring 12 more
or less seriously, the office of the Jun
ior Ku Klux Klan of Michigan was
destroyed. The records of the organi
zation were saved through the
thoughtfulness of the wife of the
state director, who preferred to ree
cue the records rather than to rescue
hti own personal effects.

and whether they will be placed un

arrested by a Cambria county detec
tive, acting under the orders of Dis
trict Attorney Weimer, and he is
charged with murder, carrying con

Burning of Fiery
Cross Drives Out
Denizens of Vice
CENTRALIA W. VA„ May 19.
This usually wild and wooly little
town in the forest fastness of West
Virginia, where bootleggers, gamblers
and bad men reigned supreme, has
suddenly assumed an air of sedate
ness due to the presence of the Ku
Klux Klan.
Six months ago liquor was sold
openly, and gambling dives were com
mon. Today it is a difficult task to
find a bootlegger here, and gamblers
are as scarce as the proverbial hen’s
teeth.
This was all brought about by the
burning of a few crosses which pro
claimed to the people of Centralia
that the Ku Klux Klan is here to
stay and that vice must go. There
have never been any Klan demon
strations here other than the public
appearance of robed men on a few
occasions of charity.
HOLD FIRST DEMONSTRATION
EPHRATA, PA.—Lancaster county
Klansmen held a spectacular demon
stration, parade and initiation here
last week, approximately 100 men be
ing initiated and 250 signing appli
cation cards. Rev. B. Monroe Pos
ten, Methodist minister, and Rev.
Hickey, of Ohio, national lecturer,
addressed the 2,000 people who as
sembled in the ball park to witness
the demonstration. The affair was
the first of a series which will be
held in the county during the next
six months.
PASTOR GETB FLAG
TOWSON, MD.—Rev. Dr. Benson,
pastor of the Providence M. E.
church, was present od with a hand
some American flag last Sunday eve
ning by the Towson provisional Klan.
The presentation speech was made by
the grand dragon, realm of Maryland,
and was followed by appropriate re
marks by several prominent cltlaens.
The flag now floats above the com
munity nail. An open-air meeting of
the local Klan organisation was held
Thursday sight.

from pneumonia which, he declared
before his death, was contracted due
to ill-treatment in the jail. The
two sisters of Klansman Poorbaugh
made an affidavit to this effect, in
which they stated their brother laid
the blame for his condition directly
at the doors of the jail attaches, ex
plaining that he was not provided
with sufficient bed clothing and was
forced to walk from his cell to the
ambulance when he was removed.
Klansman Poorbaugh’s sisters and his
aged mother, who hurried here when
they learned of his death, left for
Baltimore, their home, shortly after
he was buried Sunday, April 27.
Counsel for the jailed men at Eb
ensburg are preparing the cases for
presentation to the court at the tri
als. which are scheduled to begin the
second week in June.
Only 13 Lilly residents are in jail
in Ebensburg. State police are still
quartered at Lilly, and it is reported
that they have secured considerable
damaging evidence against the per
petrators of the riot at Lilly.
Religious and racial stumbling
blocks have been eradicated entirely
in the immediate Johnstown vicinity
by the riot and its sequences, a num
ber of Jewish citizens having voiced
their disapproval of the entire attack
on the Klansmen.
The families of the 28 Klansmen
are being cared for by the Pennsyl
vania state organization, and the sal
aries of the jailed men are being paid
fully. Every convenience they en
jojed while the bread-winners were
with them is being offered and ac
cepted.

SPRINGFIELD, 0.. May 19.
Police Chief R. E. O’Brien, whose
position was abolished under an
emergency ordinance, which be
came effective May 7, tendered his
resignation, and at a special meet
ing of police pension trustees he
was retired on a pension.
Sergt. Thomas Norton also re
signed and was placed on a pen
sion. O’Brien will receive $1,200
a year and Norton $960.
The emergency ordinance, passed
by the city commission, reorgan
ized the city police department.
These two men played promi
nent parts in the arrest of Klans
men in the city during 1923. At
one time a party of Klansmen re
turning from a funeral were ar
rested and thrown into jail to
gether with the American flag and
Bible which they were carrying
as they were returning quietly to
their homes after leaving the cem
etery.
Parade Held, Followed
by Social at School
FAWN GROVE, PA.—A parade and
naturalization featured a Klan meet
ing here recently. The Klan creed
was read by the county Kleagle, and
several Klan songs were sung. Fol
lowing the ceremonies the Klansmen
marched to a near-by school, where a

the building in their robes, the Klans
men entered in the bidding for the
pies and purchased several.

State Convention When Klan
Starts Action
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA, May 19.
—Oklahoma Democrats in their state
convention here last week by an over
whelming vote decided to send a del
egation to New York with an endorse
ment of McAdoo, and composed of a
“personnel” which will fight A 1 Smith
to the finish.
Seventeen of the 27 delegates, by
a poll taken by the correspondent of
The Fiery Cross, will vote like Ameri
cans should vote, with no “ifs” nor
“ands” nor “whys” nor “wherefores.”
“One hundred per cent American”
delegates at the state convention
overthrew the dope bucket prepared
by Governor M. E. Trapp and his
henchmen, in an attempt to control
the Oklahoma delegation so that he
could take it wrapped up in a pack
age to New York and “swap horses”
with Tammany.
The governor, who sent out an ap
peal before the convention, • asking
nis friends to “help beat those d
Ku Kluxers,” got a severe spanking
at the hands of his party, and barely
escaped being left out in the cold in
the selection of national delegates,
while Ed. H. Semans, his bitterest po
litical enemy, was named chairman
of the delegation.
