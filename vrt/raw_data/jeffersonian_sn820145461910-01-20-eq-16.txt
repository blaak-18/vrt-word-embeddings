A Winner of Prizes
Mr. J. A. Smith, of Lawrenceville,
Ga., is one of the livest, hardest
working agents that the Jefferson
ians have ever been blessed with.
When he gets a move on him in an
agents’ contest, we have to employ
extra help to handle his subscrip
tions.
After winning the first prize in
the November monthly contest for
Weekly and Magazine, he pitched in
to the Watson’s Magazine fight, and
pulled off the fifty-dollar prize for
1909.
When Mr. Watson spoke at Law
renceville in 1908, Mr. Smith intro
duced him; and, last year, when he

dared to side with Mr. Watson in his
views on Foreign Missions, the Pre
siding Elder of the Methodist church
at Lawrenceville, Dr. King, relieved
him of his stewardship. Mr. Smith
is now teaching his ninth country
school at the same place. He is a
very busy man, and besides teach
ing, farming and gathering subscrip
tions, he takes great interest in the
Farmers’ Union, of which he is coun
ty vice-president. He never loses an
opportunity to say a kind word for
the Jeffersonians, because he is a firm
believer in the principles taught by
Mr. Watson.
In a recent letter to the Jeffs, Mr.
Smith says: “I would like to see the
pictures of those agents who made
it so warm for me in the last con
test. The bad weather during the
holidays greatly handicapped me,
but if we had one man in each coun
ty to do as much, the result would
be incalculable. I have been won
derfully successful during my limited
time. Men who once frowned upon
Mr. Watson are now reading him
with the greatest relish. Foreign
Missions, Socialism and Catholicism
are three sores which need lancing.
Thank God for a man like Tom Wat
son, who is not afraid to do it.”

boat that would carry us up the Buf
falo Bayou to Houston, but the boat
landed at Harrisburg some six or
seven miles below Houston, I guess.
In the night we were told that we
must reach Houstonby morning to get
a train out of town. So we took the
road for Houston, Buck leading me
over the roughest road that I ever
heard of, for I could not see it, as I
was stone blind and barefooted. This
road had been wet and cattle had
traveled it and was then dry, how
ever. We reached Houston in due
time, and while there some gentle
man gave me a pair of new shoes
and a Confederate soldier gave me a
Glje
pair of socks. So I have to this day
a kind feeling for grand old Hous
ton. Notwithstanding all these things
not a word of complaint ever fell
from our lips. I was twenty-four
years old and Dave Arnett was about
twenty-eight. We both belonged to
Hood’s brigade, the army of Lee.
Dave was captured at Gettysburg and
I was captured at Lookout Mountain.
