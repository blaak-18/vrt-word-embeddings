THE CAUCASIAN.
Official Journal of the
City of Shreveport.
---SUND)A, FEB. 1S. Io(o,.
P.R. ClR'M RETECTED.
It has been announeed from Washing
ton that the United S:ates Sen~at has
disapproved the appointment by Presi
dent Roosevclt of Dr. Crum as collector
of the port of Charleston. S. C. In one
sense the rejection of D)r. Crum is a
surprise to the Caucasian. but it is strict
ly in conformity with "the fitness of all
good things." Dr. Crum was objection
able to the people of South Carolina not
only because of his race but because the
people of Charleston are firm in their
contention that a man more suitable for
the nosition should be appointed by Mr.
Roosevelt. Dr. Crum is of the class of
colored people who are educated and
have reached , standing in life which
gives them recognition and advantages
over the less fortunate of their race. and
it is with Dr. Crum as with men of the
Caucasian race. In the appointment of
Dr. Crum, President Roosevelt irritated
an antagonism, which hIe should have
mollified. In Charleston there are no 1
doubt white men who are good and tried r
Republicans who can fill the appoint- r
ment creditably. Why not name one of c
them? In time Mr. Roosevelt will learn c
a thing or two: he will acquire some ex- t
perience; and he will realize tha he can a
not ram a nigger down a white man's n
throat because he is President of the fi
United States. The rejection of Dr. n
Crum is an indication that there is left H
in a Republican Senate some apprecia- h
tion of the right of the people to object d
to an appointment by the President. I
POLITICAL AGITATION. de
The political agitation in Louisiana pi
will soon become active and the issue
will not be so much on the selection of m
Governor and State officers but on how la
the nomination shall be made. The great ne
majority of Democrats who vote ari in hi
,favor of nomination by primary elections in
against the convention program fkinch be
js manipulated by a chosen few in the do
interests of a few. the exclasive benefit fri
and welfare of "the select," the favored thi
slated regardless of 'the expressed ed
wishes of the people. When the cam- yo
spaign open, on these lines there will be thi
a warm and heated political atmosphere mi
nbtut the few who in the futfure, may all
'-oeure to sat iptlate the c+ nvention as a1n
in the" pW according to their own sweet
will aad as they see fit. Then there will
be a howl and a kick which may raise
Sthlie roof from the Democratic temple of C
Lowisiana.
A Russian nobleman was sent to jail
'i New York city for expectorating on
the pavement. Some friend should in
_form him that it appears' to he much
Ssafer to expectorate in the direction of
the Mtotroe Doctrine. The foreign no
'bleWmen who do that are not sent to jail.
Tiah are asked 'to arbitrate.--The Com
-noner..
The foreign noblemen may expecto
rate in the direction of the Monroe Doc
trine -and escape a licking by Uncle
- San; they may expectorate on "a per
"iceaat" in New York, but nary one
pot: venture to spit on a sidewalk in
S: ereport under a penalty of $ioo.oo
invor a hundred days on the rock pile.
SPlcture ia mind one of these noblemen
'breaking rocks on the rock pile. His
fancied digntity would become too utter

MR. ?OWEN AS A DIPLOMAT.
The Picayune in an editorial headed
"The Dliplomnacy in the Venezuelan
he C;sec." says:
it has been a long time since so able
an American as Herbert W\. Bowen. the
u;a:o nth,. is representing Venezuela in
._: tripartite European imbroglio, has
ca -eared i. the diplomatic stage.
"r'. liowen is United States minister

ing the controversv between that coun
- try ad (;e-many. England and Italy
caine uII. he waas chlt,,en by Vc tezuela t;,
ig- represet her interests in the proposed
ins settlement.
"In this case Mr. Bowen did tnot have
tor the power and prestige of the great
ne :\merip~n Reptiblic at his back. but. on
a the contrary. lie represented a feeble
et- power against three of the great nations
all of Europe. He was pitted against their
in- skilled diplomatists, and he has main
tot tained his cause against them all. He has
he been subjected to serious attempts at
zir bulldozing, but it has had no effect upon
or him. ie has. been intimidated no more
Ir. easily than lie has been defeated in di
of plomacv. In every way ihe has scored a
ad great triumph for the cause in which
cli he is enlisted.
es "A French traveler. Urbain t iohier,
id who has recently made an extensive tour
ie of observation in this country. said of
of its diplomacy:
:d "'The diplomats of Europe arc gen-r
re tlemen recruited from the richest, the
to most polite. the most ceremonious. the i
:d most egotistical. the most infatuated, the
t- most limited, the most anti-democratic i
A class: they gather" ribbons and medals e

~- themselves in gorgeous apparel of laces =
n and plumes and absurd tinsel. yet still
's manage to draw prestige and authority
le from them. They cover their miserable (
r. nakedness before the eyes of the pe le a
t with a double veil of mystery and farse- 6
- hood. and they achieve their ends by
:t duplicity, circumlocution and deceptinm. e
The time has come to put an end to ts i'e
sort of international politics. To tl..
devil with tortnous diplomacy and su
s perannuated diplomats.'
e "Mr. Bowen is a shirt sleeves diplo
I mat, but he is al's.* an able international a
r lawyer, able to met his trained oppo- n
t nents at every point.. It has been said of
i him that he believes; that duplicity is as 'n
inexcusable between honest nations as tl
between gentlemen. and that his chief .
duty is to protrrete peare, and especially _
frienrdship between his native land and it
the nation to which he may be accredift- h

A CALL TO'.iRMS.
The Commoner. Bryan'k paper, in "A
CallI to Arms" says:
"Democrats who are Democrats from
principle should assert themselves. Not
only is it their duty to' dor so, but the~
need to do so if they would gave the
party from disaster andT d'emoralizatiorr.
Retprts from every section of the coun
try make it certain that those who left
the party in 1896 tinder the pretense of
opposition to bimetallism are making a
systematic effort to regain control of
the party with a view to placing it in
the position it occupied" under Grover
Cleveland's administratirm. In this they
are being aided by the less extreme rep -
resentatives of the corporation element
that voted the ticket for reglarity's sake
without endorsing the platform. These
elements do not work openly and ho
estly, but covertly and through agents
who beg for 'harmony .
"It is time that loyal Democrats were
aroused to the danger confronting- their
party and its principles. It is time they
were organizing to combat the insidious.
influences at work within the party to
republicanize it and' make it acceptable
to the corporation- interests, foe a De.
ocratic party that espouses priaciples ac
ceptable to the trusts and the money
power is Democratic in name only. Only
thorough organization will be effective
against these tndemceraric inflnences.
This work 'of organization should beginc
now and be prosecuted with vigor. The
best way to go about this work is the
organization of clubs within the party
in every voting precinct in the country.''
Miss Alice Roosevelt. daughter of the

Pa ersia Athletes.
h Strong and skilled as wes.rn ate
letes are. there are some respects it
which the athletes of the east, and es
'r pecially those of Persia, surpass them.
ir Their skill is due to the fact tha*
:f they do not rely on brute strength, but
on adroitness, which they have ac
quired after years of strenuous train
e Ing. They know the functiolt of every
muscle in their bxodies, and they are not
1e regarded as experts until they are so
le well trained that they can perform
ic with ease any feat which depends for
Is success not only upon their strength.
y but also upon the proper play of their
muscles.
II They are not as bulky as some of the
well known athletes of Europe and
y America, but, on the other hand, their
e bodies are wonderfully symmetrical.
e and all their movements are mnost
- graceful.
In wrestling and swinging tcabe they
r. especially excel. and, no matter how
expert they may be, not a day posses
that they do not practice for severFa
