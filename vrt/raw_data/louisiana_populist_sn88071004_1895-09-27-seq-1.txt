THE CRISIS UPON US.
A TIMELY WARNING TO THE
PEOPLE.
In This Hoar of Liberty's Peril, Citizens
Must Act by Deeds, and the Hordes of
American and English Monopolists B.
Met sad ltepulsed.
Washington city is exceedingly dull
now. The cabinet officers and princi
pal bureau chiefs are mostly absent,
having their summer outing, fishing,
yachting hunting, etc., while the
routine business of the government is
done by the clerks. The president
sets the example, by going away very
early to his summer home at Gray
(;ables, in Massachusetts, and any un
der ofticer who would not follow his
example is not "up to date."
We wonder how many of our read
ers ever stopped to ligure how little
our noble president gets for his work.
It would take about one million
pounds of cotton to pay his salary an
nually. This is about 2,500 bales.
Extra good land in an extra good
year will make a bale to the acre, but
the average for the whole country is
not more than one-half of this amount.
Now our president's salary equals
the product of about five thousand
acres of cotton, raised for him free
of cost. if we take into consideration
the cost of raising the cotton and the 1
low price it brings, and pay his salary
from the net profit, so good a state
as Alabama will hardly furnish enongh
ootton to pay the bill.
Suppose we pay his salary in corn.
Say we get twenty-five cents a bushel,
it would take 200,000 bushels. A fair
average per acre in as good states as
illinois, Missouri, Iowa or Nebraska is
forty bushels per acre. This would
take the product of 5000 acres to pay
his salary, but if we count out the
cost of raising, marketing, etc., and
add the interest for the money in
vested in land, and pay the net profits
of the corn, it is doubtful if then the f
great and good state of Nebraska 1
would foot the bill This is only for n
the regular salarary, and does not in- t
clude the $5000 for flowers, the $10,
000 for cleaning house. new furniture, b
etc., and the army of servants re- r
quired to run the machine, nor the t
use of government boats for fishing nor e
the infinity of little things. t
The object of this Illustration Is to I
show how unequal things are.
We wish if there is one farmer any
where in the United States who has
confined his operations to the raising V
of staples and has made clear one C
dollar per acre the past year, he s
would write and give us his expe
rience. a
We cannot ask those who have lost n
money to send us their names, for a
their names on top of one another y
would make a shaft higher than the s
Washington Monument. What is true '
of the president's salary is also true, &
in a lesser degree, of all office holders. h
The price of labor has gone down, ii
products are cheaper, merchandise tl
much less, and in fact all industrial a
enterprises have sunk to lower levels, o
but the army of officeholders, both tl
national and state, are the same and
most of the fixed charges throughout ti
the country are the same. J
The burden falls now as it always
has and always will, upon the farmer, c
the mechanic and the laboring man. tI
To make this condition better for n
the fixed salary horde and those who b
live upon the interest of money loaned, fi
silver has been demonetized and de- Ii
stroyed as a fundamental money, a
which has increased the value of q
money in this country in the past a
twenty years fully 100 per cent. The is
=50,000 a year paid to President a
Cleveland will buy more than $100,- y
000 paid during Gen, Grant's term, fa
and it tekes three times uas much of
the commodities of labor to obtain
the money.
This condition instead of growing U
better, is growing worse every year, I
and will continue to grow worse, un
til the man who works huas become a
serf and the man who receives a samu- c
ter.a'

Who pays Hon. Buck Walton to de
liver speeches all over Texas? Buck
isn't in this fight for his health and he
says he don't want office, so where
does he get his money back?-Llano
Times.
Nobody, and he don't want any
remuneration. He is not that much
like a modern Democrat. Major
Walton received no pay for what he
did and the services he rendered the
patriotic people of this grand com-,
monwoalth while serving as chairman
of the state Democratic executive
committee when E J. Davis was
turned out of office and Richard Coke
became governor. But the scribbler
for the Times is too full of prejudice
to give any man that refuses to count
beads (party traditions) and sing the
paeans (hero worship) of Democracy (?)
when the courthouse ring so orders,
credit for being patriotic or even
honest
When the Times man gets rested,
he may explain who pays Joe Bailey's
way? Who is to pay R. Q. Mills, the
gentleman from Virginia, who pro
poses to take the stump for the gold
bugs? Are their motives purely pa
triotic? And then there is Judge
George Clark and Judge John H.
Reagan. But the Times man need
not bother about their railroad fares,
for all these gentlemen ride on passes.
We hope the modesty (?) of the Times
man will not preclude him answering
truthfully one time. Who pays these
gentlemen for their time and hotel
bills? Mills and Bailey are growing
richer all the while, working with
their mouths. Explain, Times man;
explain. For a starter, we mentioq
that Bynum of Indiana got $100 per
speech from the goldbugs.
Hits Him Hard.
Judge John C. Randolph of Fort
Worth, law partner of Congressman
C. K. Bell, and a prominent silverite,
says, speaking of R. Q. Mills' letter:
"I can remember when Mills was
almost a Greenbacker. That senti
ment seemed to be strong in Texas
about 1878 and Mills' speeches in that
year show that he was about ready to
swallow tiatism in its worst form.
The situation summed up means this:
Mills was either a demagogue then or
he is a traitor now. I have no faith
in . such a politician, and I do not
think men of any political shade who
admire honest expressions from public
officials can fall into ecstacies over
the senator's latest effusion."
All sorts of Democrats are hitting
the gentleman from Virginia hard.
James K. Jones of Arkansas says:
"I read Senator Mills' letter to the
chairman of the Democratic commit
tee of Texas. The comment in the
newspapers about the Texas senator
being the latest convert against the
free coinage of silver is all nonsense.
His vote on the repeal of the Sherman
act clearly defines his position on that
question. He was against free coin
age then as he is now. If the senator
is quoted correctly, he made state
ments in that letter which every 15
year-old schoolboy knows are not
facts."
What Do Tea Thiak f It?
The London Times, in the course of
as editorial a column in length, says,
speaking of presidential posszbilities:
After the Wilson tariff bill compro
mise, Mr. Cleveland was the most dis
credited man in American public life,
and the sweeping Republican victory
in November appeared to seal his fate
uas a Democratic leader. Curiously
enough, the second difference in his
party saved his reputation. He has
been sqund on the silver question all
the time, and the result of the cour
age and tenacity he has displayed has
been to materially improve the pros
pests of his party in the coming pres
idential campaign.

g 1893 He Mowed the Single told Standard
d Pd lu the Democratic Party Proda
cing Rumu.
Acain I say unto you that my king
dlom is like unto a man who goeth
forth to sow a certain kind of seed.
And when he soweth it he goeth
at fishing.
And while he fished and drank beer
the seed grew and multiplied.
tl;:t there came up among the good
seed those that wanted to tear it up
by the roots.
k But the master said, wait until the
e harvest time and it shall be separated.
e lest in cutting down the bad ye de
stroy some of the good.
And it was so.
And this is the parable of the sower.
h In 1896 1 sowed the gold standard
. seed in the Democratic party.
And Bland and Ilolman and many
there were that sought to destroy
the gold standard seed.
And I suffered them until the elec
tion came, and they were weeded out,
root and branch.
e And I rejoiced and went a-fishing.
. Again my kingdom is like unto a
net that was cast into the sea, and
i caught every kind of fish;
Which. when it was full, they drew
to the shore and selected such as they
wanted and cast the others away.
n And when his disciples drank an
other glass of beer and wondered.
(;rover said:
The net is the platform which we
e adopted at Chicago in 1892;
And we cast it out all over the land.
And it caught them *.gwine and
. comin'.'
e The free silverites and the gold
bugs,
The high tarifttites and the free
traders;
The national bankers and the anti
national bankers;
The home rulers and the federal
ists;
The trusts and the people whom
the trusts robbed;
" Thu corporations and those whom
the corporations oppressed.
And when the election was over we
r gathered unto us the cuckoos, and
the trusts and corporations and the
wealthy.
And we spat unto the rabble.
t And ignored the people.
I And the rich and mighty rejoiced,
for they reaped where they had not
sown.
And there are many tares, or kick
- ers, but we will try and keep them in
s the net.
t And yet again my kingdom is like
unto a man who summoned his kins
men around him:
And promised them if they would
make him their ruler and pay tribute
1 to him he would give them a measure
I of honey which when they ate it
would make them wise, happy and
prosperous.
And they did it.
And when each man received his
measure, and went home he found it
was gall. and very bitter;
Except certain who had influence
and riches and power among their
brethren;
Their measures were filled with
honey of the sweetest flavor.
And there went up a great cry of
discontent.
i Then the ruler sent for those whose
I measures were tilled with honey;
And they came as one man.
And the ruler inquired of them, why
doth the people complain?
And the wisemen who had received
Sthe measures of honey answered him
and said:
Because of tile gall thou gavest
them,
And the ruler was troubled for he
had not honey for all.
And he said unto them that had re
ceived honey: Go out into the by
ways, and unto the uttermost parts of
my kingdom.
And tell the people it is not gall
that I gavest them, but sweet, nice
honey.
And if they only have confidence
it will taste sweeter when they eat it.
And the wise men did as they were
commanded.
And many of the people did eat and
were filled.
And although they made sour faces,
they said it was sweet.
And the wise men and the ruler
prospered.
And the wise men were called
cuckoos.
And when Grover had thus spake
his disciples marveled, insomuch that
they forgot to drink another glass of
beer.
And when (;rover saw that they
were astonished and did not drink 1
their beer, he knew they did not un- 1
derstand the parable.
And he said: Oh, ye of wonderful
paunches, but small understanding,
how long shall I suffer you?
Perceive ye not the parable?
The ruler is myself.
The honey is the offee, which I 1
have given to you.
The gall is our cheek and the
broken promises we have given to the <
popl. jt
C·,.
Carlisle, Hoke Smith, Morton and
others are gone out to convince the
people that the gall is honey, and will
taste sweet if they have confidence.
The people who believe and eat
their gall and call it sweet are the
Democrats who will still continue to
vote with us.

understand--Hardy (Ark.) Buzz Saw.

Of course the states would suffer to a
certain extent through having to pay
their obligations abroad in gold, but
the loss would be a mere drop in the
bucket compared with the profits to
be reaped from the markets of South

SOME DEEP THOUGHT.
ONE WAY TO DOWN GREEDY
MONOPOLY.
I The emed Proposed Is Just to All.
sad Is the OIly Way That the People
Cam Defeat the Enrreachments of
Monopoly-Read and Think.
If a man enters your home and re
lieves you of your purse or other
valuables, it is rightly considered a
crime, because it takes from you
without an equivalent. Now please
tell us wherein you are less injured
when the Standard Oil, or any other
trust, enters your house and takes
weekly its tribute by adding to the
cost of those things you must have?
You may answer that there is a ditTer
ence, because you willingly give up
the extra pay or extortion and that you
could do without these things
if you did not wish to pay. You may
think so. but it is nevertheless untrue.
You cannot do without coal during
water, nor flour, meat and many other
articles except at the cost of your
life. Nor do we beiic\e you have fully
persuaded yourself that you will
ingly" pay this extortion. Iho sneak
thief takes without your immediate
knowledge, these monopolies take d.ti
antly before your very eyes--more liKe
highwaymen with pistols at your head.
You have been sutfering this thing for
years, not because you like it nor bc
cause you have not realized its injus
tice--but because you have not iearn
ed any method of preventing it. You
have relied on "competition" bring
ing down prices to a right tigure, only
to see combines follow each other
closely in nearly all lines of human
production. Your politicians and
party organs have been aiding to
keep you thinking so. and prejudicing
you against every -"theory"' or -.isn'"
that pointed another way, rust as the
priests of the heathen temple
warned their contributing dupes
against listening to the reasonings of
the few philosophers of every age
who tried to turn the victims of super
stitious cunning from the nets of those
who profited off their credulity. Ite
cause you have refused to use your
reason, because you have listened
like children to hired agents of these
monopolies, because you read only
their voluminous literature, because
you sneer at those who really want to
do something definite to change the
existing conditions. We say because
of these things you have been herded
to the polls and voted (all the while
believing the acts your own) to per
petuate the same system, and conse
ouently have been getting the same
system.
There is one way, and only one way,
that you can defeat the encroachments
of monopoly. Of course this particu
lar method is the one most feared,
and, therefore, most bitterly dc
nounced by the monopolies. You
have tried anti-monopoly and inter
state commerce law farces. only to
find them impotent. Had you learned
the first lessons in political economy3
you could have known the results of
these before wasting time and money
on them. You would have known the
inconsistency of making a law against
one or more men getting control of a
commodity and extorting their neigh
bors. If you could do that, you could
fix the price at which your grocer
must sell butter or eggs. and you
would revolt justly at such despotism.
But there is a remedy, and this is
it: Let the nation lproduce and retion
oil and sell it at the cost of well paid
labor. More than that price no mo
nopoly can compel you to pay. Let
the state or nation mine and trans
port coal at the cost of well paid la
bor. More than that price no coal
monopoly can make you pay. Then
the cost of a thing will be the labur
in it, and not interest, rent and water
ed profits as now. 'l'rnis is the awful
"paternalism"' the monoplolists and
their hirelings want to frighten you
with. An awful picture, ain't it'
Which wouild you rather do than to
be robbed? When you are w-ie
enough to vote for men who want
these things, the way to get the oil
and coal lands will be easy to solve.
