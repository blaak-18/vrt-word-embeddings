The ntlioduction of a bill In the
Le~alatate, by" the reptesentative
from thus parish, to create a railroad
commission in this State, no doubt
will, if enacted into law, contribute
to the welfare and prosperity of
the people of Louisiana.. It is in
line wlth the progress and triumph
of popular rights.
It is full time to teach all corpo
rate power, and their henchmen,
"who bend the hinges of the knee
that thrift may follow fawning" that
the people "have somei ights- and
privileges that even railroads are
bound to respect. .Among these
is the right to enjoy the fratis of
their s F earned labor; and the
privilege to regulate by law the
charges levied on all articles of pro
duction apd. consumption trans
ported by public carriers.
A railroad, canal, or other public
undertaking, exists by the authority
of the delegated power of the peo
ple, and is chartered by law for the
use, benefit and advantage of- ,all
the citizens of tl State, as wdllas
for the profit enumeratlb.of
rivate funds and capital invested
-.erein.
We do not erlook the fact that
railroads give employment to
thousands of the good people of the
country, and assist in developing
all the material resources of the
land through whic lheº steam their
course, but all this does not give
them the rights to exact exhorbitant
tariff rates, or in railroad parlance,
"all the trade will bear."
When in the name of progress and
civilization corporate power, as
common carriers, is perverted to
maintain exhorbitant exactions,
they must learn that every dollar
collected beyond a legitimate profit
in the business of public transporta
tion, is not only a violation of the
spirit of our laws and institutions,
but that it becodlts extortion and
oppression. . '
About three-fourths e States
of the Union have ado ted laws
regulating railroad traffic. Texas,
which was a frontier country when
Louisiana was nearly half a century
old, in her last election achieved a'
great victory over the monopolies
within her borders, not the least
among which were the railroads, by
electing Gov. Hogg by over one
hundred thousand majority.
Some years ago the Congress of
the United States were compelled,
in response to public demand, whiich
they have been so slow to heed as
against money power, to enact the
Inter-State Commerce Ccmmission
for the protection of her citizens
against the greed and rapacity of
the railroads.
It is to be hoped that our Legis
lature will enact laws for the protec
tion ot the people in that respect.

Speaking of the alleged bribes
offered to United Statess enators by
the sugar trust, The Wilmington
Messenger says:
Suppose rascals and lobbyists had gone to
William G. Rives, John Y. Mason, George
E. Badger, William A. Graham, Thomas
Bragg, John C. Calhoun, William G. Pres
ton, George McDuffie, John M. Berrien,
John Bell, Jefferson Davis, Ben Hill, Robert
Toombs, Alex Stephens and other famous,
able men "'befo de wah," with propositions
of bargain and corruption--offers to buy
their souls for the devil and get there sup
port for pending measures or to advance the
selfish schemes of the bribers, what would
have happened, think you ?
The Messenger answers its own
question by saying that the south
erners would have knocked the.dogs
from their presence. When Colonel
Robert Treat Paine was in the fed
eral house some rascal representing
an eastern ring went to his seat and
made a corrupt proposal. Paine
immediately arose and informed the
house that "this fellow," as he
called him, was trying to bribe him.
The lobbyist lost no time in sneaking
out of thT capitol, and he had the
good sense to keep out of sight
until the excitement was over. Those
who knew Paine best said that he
would have killed the corruptionist
if he had approached him on the
street with the same proposal.
In the better days of the republic
it would have been dangerous to
suggest a bribe to a senator. Douglas
on one occasion was so enraged by
a corrupt offer from the agent of a
big land company that he seize d him
by the collar and dragged him to
the head of the hotel stairway and
then kicked him dowvn.
But in these days we read of
bribes and attempted bribes in the
senate, and calmly turn to another
page, without giving the matter
more than a passing thought. Times
change and men change with them.
Among the bills introduced in the
Legislature is one by Representative
Mouton, from this parish, to repeal

Mr. A. D. Martia was elected secretary
pro tem.
Mr. Webb read an interesting essay on
the -"Metric System" arguing very forcibly
the advantages of that method as compared
with the present, variable and unsatisfactory
standard of weights and measures.
Mr. Philip Martin gave blackboard illus
trations of the practical working of the
"Metric System," and by request of Insti
tute will continue the discussion at next
meeting.
By motion of Miss F. S. Greig, the follow
was duly adopted: Resolved that the
manager of the Institute be and is hereby
authorized to report to parish Supt. H. E.
Toll, all teachers absent from Institute this
date, with request that he enforce the law
relative to thq non-attendance of teachers
at the Institute.
It was alsd're.olved that the manager be
authorized to call a special meeting of the
Institute two weeks previous, to the opening
of the State Institute in Lafayette.
The subjects for next meeting were fixed
as follows: Mr. Philip Martin, "Metric
System" (continued); Prof. W. A. Le Rosen,
"Grammar"; Miss M. E. Toll, "Select
Reading"; R. C. Greig, subject optional.

Three Killed.
The following is taken from the
Times - Democrat of Tuesday.
Messrs. Blockeand Labe, who were
killed, were known in Lafayette, the
latter being a brother of our towns
man, Mr. A. Labe, Who heard of
the sad news Tuesday morning:
Donaldsonville, La., May 2x.-A
terrible and deadly shooting affray
took place this evening at 5 o'clock
in Dorseyville, in which the partici
pants met sudden and violent deaths.
Those engaged were Messrs. Adolph
Block and Jules Labe, two prominent
merchants of Dorseyville, and a
9 gro named Caesar Bundy, also of
Dorseyville. The particulars are as
follows:
The negro Bundy-was engaged in
a quarrel with an Italian. Block,
to preserve peace, interposed, which
turned the wrath of the negro toward
him, and the negro applied a vile
epithet to him. Mr. Block in turn
cursed the negro, who hurriedly left
the place, remarking: "You won't
call me that when I come back."
He £soon returned armed with a
revolver, and dared the two gentle
men to approach him, using very
obscene langutage. Both armed
themselves with clubs, rushed at the
negro, and a general fusilade of
shots followed. As the two men
advanced the negro aimed his revol
ver and shot Block in the mouth,
mortally wounding him, and receiv
ing in return a mortal wound from
Block with lightning-like quickness.
The negro then turned and shot Mr.
Labe through the brain, killing him
instantly. Block, though desperately
wounded, still continued firing, and
did not desist until the chambers of
his revolver were empty. After
firing the last shot he fell upon his
face, and died instantly. The negro
ran a few paces as though seeking
an escape, but his wound was a
mortal one. IHe started and fell
and also expired. Of all the shots
fired but three took effect, and they
produced death.
The bloody tragedy is deeply de
plored as Messrs. Block and Labe
were popular merchants. The negro
is said to have been a desperate
character. Mr. Labe was formerly
s cretary of the Ascension and
D)onaldsonville Board or Trade, and
was well known in New Orleans
newspaper circles. He leaves a
wife and one child.
A Progressive Euchrc.

season was a progressive euchre party at the

Zerelda Bailey. The first idy's prize (a
lovely covered cologne bottle4 was won by
