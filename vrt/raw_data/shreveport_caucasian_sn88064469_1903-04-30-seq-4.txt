CLEVELAND AND THE NEGRO.
The clippings following may be pe
rused n ith interest:
"The speech made by Grover Cleve
land in New York the other day on the
negro problem was bothi sensible and
timely. It shows that Mr. Cleveland
knows more about the negro than most
Northern people do, and his speech is
appreciated by both races in the South.
The speaker said the Southern pecple
are the best friends the negro has and
that they are better q:ualified to se:tle
the issues involved than the Northern
people. but his sentiments will not re
ceive general endorsement."-Mlans
field Journal.
Grover Cleveland has recently had
his say on the race question, and a very
good say it was, too. But, if our mem
ory is not at fault, his conduct to
wards Douglass and Bruce, of Missis
sippi, during his second administration
were not much more acceptable to the
people of the South than the antics of
'i'eddv Rooevel<."-Homer Guardian
Journal.
One reason why Cleveland was not
publicly criticised by Democrats as
Roosevelt is being condemned was be
cause he was the representative of
Democrats who were restrained, some
what in the spirit which governs when
something disagreeable has occurred in
the family circle. In his speech Mr.
Cleveland advanced no suggestion for
the betterment of present conditions,
and he reiterated in high-sounding
phrases the views expressed in more
simple words of a problem well under
stood throughout the South and by
many people in the North as well, and
which will settle itself if the negro is
let alone. While the Caucasian is un
compromisingly Democratic and stands
unflinchingly for the rule of intelligence
and white supremacy, it will subscribe
to the shrine of no man, even if it be
Grover Cleveland, and while his good
words for the South, to whom he must
ever be indebted for the honors on him
conferred, are appreciated, we, as the
Guardian-Journal, have in memory his
conduct towards Bruce of Mississippi
and Fred Douglas of the District of
Columbia (whose wife was white) and
who, although negroes, on more than
one occasion, received not only the
"official" but the social recognition
which all Southern men disapprove
radically.
WHY DISCREDIT BRYAN.
Col. W. J. Bryan has notified his New
York friends that he will be in the East
in May and deliver a series of addresses
on political issues. He no doubt will
take especial pains to speak against
what he calls the reorganization of the
Democratic party. In other words he
will try to boost up the Kansas City
platform. His main attack of course will
be directed against Hill, Gorman and
Cleveland.-Vernon News.
Why should Mr. Bryan assist or aid
and abet in the discredit of the Kansas
City platform, which has received the
endorsement of more than six millions
of Democrats? If he should direct his
main attack against "the reorganizers,"
so-called, of which Cleveland is the
chief fugleman, he will be justified be
cause these "reorganizers" are radically
opposed to the Kansas City platform,
which is thoroughly and consistently
Democratic. Why should any organ of
the Democracy, especially one published
beyond the influence of the trusts and
combines in the metropolitan centers,
persist in their abuses and ridicule of
Mr. Bryan and the extolling of Mr.
Cleveland? A fact is a fact, and it is a
fact that Bryan was loyal to the party
while Cleveland sulked and aided and
abetted in the election of McKinley. Is
not Cleveland, then, a deserter? Why,
then, should loyal men discredit a leader
who has been tried and true for one who
when tried, rebelled'defiantly, joined the
enemy, and assumed to be bigger and
greater than the party who had honored
him and made him a President of the
United States?
A Chicago man shot and fatally in
jured a constable who came to arrest
him, and then handing the offic& his
revolver announced that he would sur
render. This is what is technically
known as rubbing it in.-New Orleans
States.
Peculiar, rather! If the constable had
been "np-to-date" with his handy and
ready pistol he would have shot and
killed the Chicago man deader than a
dried herring.
The Commoner says: "Having ex
haeuted themselves in their wild enthu
siasm over the President's merger
l.using exercise, the administration or
The Commoner says: "The Cincin
nati Enquirer seems to resent the cele
bration of Jefferson's birthday. It
might offer a prize to the person who
will guess nearest to the number of
years it will require to suppress all
mention of Jefferson's principles."
The Morehouse Clarion says: "The
Monroe News is still worrying about
how the Democrats of this State are go
ing to nominate their officers and ih pre
dicting all kinds of dire things if they
don't do as it says and nominate by
white primaries. Don't trouble your
soul, Urother. The Democrats, at the
oroper time. wi ¶ do the right thing and
hat which s'ill redound to the best in
terests of the State and people, whether
me and Cafferv like it or not. Tust 'hold
eou rihorses a little A-hile longer.
The sanity of the negro leader of the
Indiana ghouls is now questioned. We
don't know how negroes grow up in that
country. but no negro in this country
while in possession of his right mind
can be induced to enter a graveyard at
night.-Memphis News.
Too true, a right minded negro shuns
a graveyard at night.-Richland Beacon
News.
And a "right minded' negrs would
feel joyful resting on the bosom of Old
Nick rather than to listen to a groan or
stand and gaze at a walking ghost.

Youngstown (Ohio) Vindicator of
March 29 said: "People who watch the
weather predictions of W. T. Foster
in the Vindicator have noticed the re
markable accuracy with which he has
hit the changes during the present
month, particularly his forecast of
warm wave, rains, cold wave and
snows. Some months ago the Vindi
cator called attention to the manner in
which the predictions have been ful
filled. The forecasts by Mr. Foster are
proving themselves of inestimable
"alue."

quoted Scripture to his wife, showing
that the household duties should prop

TREATY RIGHTS.

the Same.
Pekin, April 29.-Minister Conger
has sent a note to Prince Ching, the
grand secretary, protesting against
two features of Russia's proposed Man
churian agreement, which are consid
ered particularly antagonistic to Amer

China promising not to open more
ports to foreign trade because nego
tiations are progressing in connection
with the American commercial treaty
for the opening of Mukden and Taku
Shan, and it objects to promising that
the foreign employes in China shall
only be Russians. The United States
withholds expression regarding the
other demands, but is prepared to in
