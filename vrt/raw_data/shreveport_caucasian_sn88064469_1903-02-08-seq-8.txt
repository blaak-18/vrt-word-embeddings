Discussing this point. President
T'lomasson said: "At our meeting hell
in New Orleans January 14. and 15 we
made it possible for every organization
cf citizens representing any community
in the four states which had for its pur
pose the upbuilding of its section or any
portion of it to become members of the
Four States Immigration League at a
cost of only $5 per annum.
"Now, understand," continued -Mr.
Thomasson. "this niembership is held by
'some - special organization, commercial
club. agricultural association, manufac
tturing association, no matter whether it
ma-- he a chamber of commerce. busi
ness league, progressive union, or-what
other name it may bear. VWhat we desire
to accomplish is to bring together the
active and energetic workers of the or
ganizations of these four states who are
working to build up this section into' one
concrete body, and by co-operating with
the railroads, and with the help of the
newspapers, supplemented by special
printed matter from the different lo
cliities represented, let the people of the
whole United St.. tes, and the entire
world for that matter, realize that we
want more people, more money, more
factories,'and that any good citizen from
any section of the civilized world will
il welcome here. .
"`'e are placing this annual member
hip at only $5 for the reason that we
want the smaller communities repre
sentLd. Now understand, that this mem
kership can be held only, by an organi
tation and not by an individual. We do
iiot care to accept $5 from any invest

"LITTLE DROPS OF WATER."
Who Wrote It --Two Reputed Au
thorn Brushed Aside.
Librarian John Ashhurst of the Mer
cantile lib)rary has made further inves
tigation into the claims of MIre Julia
A. ('Ct:1,'y for a iniunorial as the au
thor of the popular childi.ootJ lhynii.
"Little Things." This time the author
ship is even denied Florence Sargent
Osgood. who apparently disputed 9he
claims of the Goldsburg woman.
Superintendent Irooks, who denied
the request that the school children he
permitted to contribute to a fund for
Mrs. Carney. also made some inquiries
on his own account. but could not find
the poem among the books in the board
of education library. In the diction
ary of hymnology edited by J.lohn Jul
ian, M. *., an article written by Jul
ian himself gives lDr. E. C. trewer as
the author of 'tittle Things." it being
published by him in 1 4S in "'ReadIng
and Spelling." Subsequently lie verses
were altere:l :ld appeared inl other ju
venuile publicatiolns.
'he original (or ireweri version o
"Little Things" reads:
Lit!.- drops of water.
ILitt>-- gr:ions of sand.
ŽIaks thh- :::<:hty ocean,
Male the ba.utous land.
Dtraw !,y s:raw the sparrow
.ili s , s cozy nOst;
"eaf I hl al- the flrest
S:,nd--s in verdure drest.
L-u.-.r after letter
Words and Iooks are ana#;
*ittie and tb little
Mountains level laid.
Drop by drop is iron
Worn in time away;
perseverance. patience,
Ever win their way.
Ever finished labor
Once did but begin.
Try and go on trying;
That's the way to win.
Subsequently an American version o%
the same poem app;leared. Some ac
credit this to Mrs. Carney, others to
Mrs. Osgood. This version is the one
largely used in Sunday sciiool hymnals
of little foilks. It reads:
Little drops of water,
Little grains of sand.
Make the mighty ocean
And the beauteous land.
And the little moments,
Humble though they be,
Make the mighty ages
Of eternity.
Little deeds of kindness,
Little .words of love.
Make our earth an Eden
Like the heaven above.
So our little errors
Lead the soul astray
From the path of virtue
Into sin to stray.
Little seeds of mercy.
Sown by useful hands,
Grow to bless the nations
Far in heathen lands.
This version has been in turn altered
and realtered in subsequent publica
tions. Fitzgerald in his "Story of Fa
mous Songs" gives the authorship of
the lines to Mrs. Carney, but Libra
rian Ashhurst regards this as an error.
Fitzgerald. however, says the idea is
not an original one with the author.
Shakespeare expressed the same idea
in beautiful language. "If we accept
that, we will have to erect our memo
rial to Shakespeare and not Mrs. Car
ney," was the good humored comment
of 'Mr. Ashhurst.
Like the authorship of "Beautiful
Snow," the parentage of "Little Thilns"
is clothed in obscurity.
While the friends and partisans of
MIrs. Carney seek to send her name
down to immortality, others rise in
number to dispute her claims. In the
meantime the Philadelphia school chil
aren will probably spend their pennies I
for candy.--Philadelphia Inquirer.
A Millionaira's Sound Advice.
It was a pretty as well as an appro
priate compliment which a wealthy
philanthropist in central New York
paid the other day to Mr. George W.
Perkins, the well kqppwn financier,
when he caused to havi printed upon
m thousand rulers given away to school
children the following quotation from
Mr. Perkins: "Too many young men in
this country don't want to work hard.
They prefer to take things easy, stay
Dp late at night and lie abed too long
a the morning. They never can get
thead that way. Time and conditions
may change, but the old rule remains
the same - that there is no success
without keeping everlastingly at it."
Wiser words to keep before the eyes of
kmerican boys and girls could hardly
e found than these. It will be remem
ered that ar. Perkins has come up to
his present high and commanding posi
Ion in the commercial world from one
>f the humblest and lowest positions in
he ranks., He was once an office boy
:o a member of the firm of J. I'ierpont
Miorgan.-Leslie's Weekly.
A Witty Bishop.
When Dr. Clarke of Rhode Island
ras elected bishop and was paying his
ast pastoral calls before entering upon
is bishopric, he visited, among others,
L lady of his congregation, a good
iousewife, who was distinguished for
he size of her family. After he had
tayed awhile the good doctor arose to
,. and the lady said to him, "But, doc
or, you haven't seen my last baby,
iave you?" ".No, madam," answered
be doctor, "and I never expect to."

The bicentenary of the birth of John
Wesley is to be elaborately celebrated

sent week of Wesleyan university, it
