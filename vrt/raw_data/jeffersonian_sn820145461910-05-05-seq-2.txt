The Unj outness of Local School Tax
LOCAL TAX FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS.
Dear Sir: —Being a constant read
er of the “Jeffs”, I have become very
much interested in the discussion of
“Local Tax for Schools” in the week
ly. I do not wish to take up very
much of your valuable time and
space, but I trust the discussion will
continue until your readers have re
ceived a great deal more light on the
subject than we have been able to
obtain from a perusal of the argu
ments so far given.
In last week’s issue of The Jeffer
sonian, Th os. H. Andrews states that
there are on his place a white school
and a negro school; that the white
school closed last week, while the
negroes are still running their
school. This situation he charges to
local tax. Now, Mr. Editor, one of
your penetrating mind may readily
see how local tax could produce this
state of affairs, but a man of my
mental caliber must have a more ex
plicit statement than that furnished
by Dr. Andrews. This, Dearing
school district, has both a white
school and a negro school within its
borders. It also levies a local tax
for public schools. The negro school
has been closed for some time. The
white school is still in session, and
will continue until the full term of
nine months has expired, unless the
smallpox or some like calamity
breaks it up.
In your reference to Dr. Andrews’
letter you state, that with the lights
before you, you are opposed to this
double taxation, by which some get
what they want at the expense of
others. Generally speaking, I think
this a sound proposition, but I do not
think it applies very forcibly to local
tax for public schools.
I think it a safe proposition to
state that the benefits, financial and
otherwise, to be derived from the
building up and maintaining a first
class school in any community will
be greater than the cost to the tax
payers. Good schools attract good
settlers. Good citizens help to pro
duce more wealth. The presence of
new-comers of the good sort en
hances the value of property already
in the community. Now, if the tax
payer gets value received for the
money expended, why should he ob
ject to the tax because some poor
children will receive some benefit
therefrom? The taxpayers would
certainly find it an uphill business
accumulating and holding wealth
without the aid of the poorer class.
Now, Mr. Editor, I do not hope to
change your mind on this subject,
but I am looking for light on it, and
1 find from past experience that the
Jeffs are a splendid medium through
which to receive the light. Their
columns are always open to both
sides of a question.
With the lights before me I am in
favor of local tax for public schools,
but I am not averse to changing my
mind and position on a question
when I find I am wrong. Turn on
the light.
With many wishes for the con
tinued success of the Jeffs, I am
Very sincerely yours,
Dearing, Ga. G. F. RODGERS.
Answer.
The foregoing thoughtful letter of
our friend, Rodgers, is well worth
careful consideration. His argu
ment, that good schools attract good
settlers who increase wealth and ad
vance the price of property, looks
perfectly beautiful. But if he will
excuse me for saying so, it won’t
stand examination.
In the first place, where are these
good settlers to come from? People
in the country move to town to
school their children; but if each
militia district taxes the property
owners to establish local academies,
who is to do the moving? Town
people are not going to move out
into the rural communities, the im
migrants are mostly illiterate peo
ple; and we consequently have no
available supply of “good settlers” to
draw from. In the second place,
when you tax the whites to furnish
these local schools for the negroes, it
will be increasingly difficult to get
farm labor; and the logical result
will be that as the local tax-rate
goes up, the value of land will go
down. In the third place, the tax is
utterly unjust. When we appro
priate money out of the State treas
ury for common schools there is
equity in it, because the money
comes from all the people, rich and
poor, black and white, country and
town. But when you impose a tax
on the land of a militia district you
put the burden on one class for the
benefit of another. And you give the
negro children an education at the
expense of the white property-owner.
The negro does not contribute to it,
as he does in the case of the taxes on
his head, on the circus, the near
beer, and the W. and A. Railroad in
come.
In the fourth place, the local
school tax is a discrimination against
the local property owner; and is
violative of the fundamental princi
ples of democracy and of equity. In
the fifth place, it is Socialism of the
rankest sort; it will lead to revolu
tionary consequences if not checked
in time.
I deeply regret that I did not give
the law careful study when it was
first proposed. Some how, it just
slipped by, without attracting much
attention. As stated by another
who writes on the subject, it seems
to have been engineered by the ci
ties which feared the effects on them
selves of the rapidly increasing ap
propriations made by the legislature
for the common schools.
The local school-tax is ABOMINA
BLY UNJUST. It gives the school
authorities, the negroes and the
property-less whites the power to
confiscate to their own use a part of
the PROPERTY OF THE MINORI
TY. And those who confiscate the
property soothe the victim with the
assurance that they will spend his
coin in such away as to fascinate
“good settlers,” and advance the
price of the property which wasn’t
confiscated!
By George!

(After “coming to:”)
How would it do to tax the land
owners for the money to build a col
lege for the niggers in every Militia
District? That would attract coons
from all other States; and we could
have a hot old time in every old
town, any old night.
THAT SCHOOL TAX ACT SHOULD
BE REPEALED.
Dear Sir: —Just a few years pre
vious to the amendment to the Con
stitution of Georgia, allowing local
school taxation, there was a powerful
cry for more money for public
schools. Such counties as Fulton,
Chatham, Richmond, Bibb, etc., to
gether with the railroads and rich
corporations, saw they were paying
something like half of the tax, and
Ueffersonlan
schooling only a small portion of the
children.
Now, the question was, how to
stop the demand for more money,
which they would have to pay, be
cause the people were going to have
better schools in spite of all they
could do? So they proposed two
amendments to the Constitution at
the same time, to be be voted on by
the people:
Ist. To allow local taxation for
school purposes.
2d. To limit State tax to five mills.
The second would bar the State
from appropriating any more, and
the first would allow the laboring
class of people to tax the life out of
the land-owner.
Now, to substantiate my views, I
will cite you to the vote on these two
amendments: look at the returns of
the large cities. (I would give them
if I could, but I only remember they
were large.) Why were they so in
terested in the country local tax?
It is true that some of the smaller
and poorer counties voted for this
amendment, but they did it not
knowing its purpose nor intent.
Now, if it is right to tax the rich
to educate the poor, it is certainly
not right to excuse the very rich
(who have all their wealth in one
district), and tax the life out of the
small or large land-owner.
My object is to give you my views,
and if there is anything in them you
can investigate.

LOCAL SCHOOL TAX.
More Talk About This Educational
Craze.
I believe it is a custom universal
in civilization for the boys to occa
sionally waste a few volleys of am
munition to break the monotony of
a fruitless hunt; and as the world
leads, we follow 7 .
Now, we have passed through one
term of so-called public school in
Randolph county, under the local tax
scheme. It is no longer a scheme
for discourse. We only have to look
at the notorious facts.
We witnessed on the first Monday
in September, 1906, the negroes, as
same as whites’ in all the towns in
Randolph county, opening up with
their schools.
We witnessed throngs of negro
children from six to eighteen years
old leaving the farms and going to
the towns to board with their cous
ins, aunts, uncles, or grandmothers
and going to school.
So the most of the negroes have
had full nine months’ school, while
those little pale-faced white country
children (over whom Prof. Childs
lost so much water from his eyes)
had to remain on the farms and help
their old fathers and mothers gather
the crops so as to raise tax money to
pay for negro schooling.
There is no regardful voter as
Randolph county but what is obliged
to know that local school tax works
a hardship on farmers of Randolph
county, and only benefits school offi
cers, tax receivers and collectors by
swelling their salaries.
If the patrons of any special school
or locality can spare their children

nine months in the year to go to
school, they are certainly able to
supplement three months to the six
months we already had, and that
would be satisfactory and fair to all,
and much cheaper to those who
groan under the burden of local tax
to school negroes.
Has any sane man with all the
light before him, the bold, contemp
tuous impudence to say that the lo
cal school tax in Randolph county
has really benefited any one except
school officers, whom it was intended
to benefit, instead of pale-faced
country children who have fetched
so much water from school officers’
eyes?
Now, I do not intend to be illogi
cal, illiberal, and God forbid. I am
disingenuous. Let me say that our
farmers’ children who are largely
digging local school tax out of the
fields are incensed with humiliation
which can only engender a feeling of
unrest, and the result will be to ar
ray one class against the other. And
the government of no nation, State,
town, county or community can pros
per in morals, religion or govern
ment, neither in time of war or
peace, with one-half of her subjects
arrayed against the other half.
I will suggest that, as our small
farmers can’t spare their children
more than from two to six months in
the year for the school-room (and
more would be worthless), they en-»
courage them to make the best pos
sible use of that time they can. The
rest of the year train them to work,
and make them do reasonable labor.
Meanwhile, furnish them with good
periodicals and a few choice histories
to read at odd times and rainy days
and encourage your children to read
them. Organize a debating society
at every country schoolhouse to take
