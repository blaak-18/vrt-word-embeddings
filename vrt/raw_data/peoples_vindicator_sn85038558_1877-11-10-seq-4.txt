On Monday of last week two uegro,
horse thieves were lynched on Sicily Is
land in Ca.taholla ;,rish. The Cat;chon,
Ia News very justly condenuzs tilhe ct.
These thiev's wer'tt taken out of the
hands of the law oftieirs. Under the
,old jury systemn it I' true they stood in t
but small danger of punislhment ntnder
the law, but it is to be hoped t hat the in

some regard ifor I their oaths :as jurrs. and

Father Hayes and the Big Injl:ns.
[From the Cincinnati Saturday Night.]
A "big Injun" talk was carl icd on at
the White House at \Vashington, the
other day. Spotted Tail and other dis
tinguished sachenms from the setting stun
called-upon their Great Father, iayes,
to remonstrate against any of the rules of
eivilization or any of the maxinis of corm
mon law being applied to thelm, and to
ascertaai what was being done to insure
their comfort during the winter that is
approaching, and what the government
is ready to do towards facilitating a:n e:r
ly opening of the spring scalping. The
Great Father received them with distin
guished honor. He couldn't have done
more hald he been their great-grarml falth
er. -}e allowed them to squat around on
the lrpet just as it suited them, and
they Were free to spit on the stove if they
wanted to. When they brought out the
pipe of peace their Great Father smoked
it, pretending not to notice Mrs. Hayes
shaking her fist at him with a threaten
ing gesture, through the window. Spot
ted Tail complained of the reservations
that had been prepared for them. He
said there was no elevators at the hotels,
the system of letter delivery was very
imperfect, and the bjse ball ground was
shamefully out of repair. The Great Fa
ther made a imemorandum of these com
plaints (which if true should consign the
manement of Indian afltiirs to general
exec Jtidn) and said that he would see
thtatqi.glaring abuses were corrected.
He said orders had been given to intro
duce the telephone upon the reservations
and in a short time every Indian would
have telephonic communications between
his residence and his office.
Mau-afraid-ot'f-a-clean-shirt asked if a
series of lectures couldn't he secured for
the coming winter, and detsired the Great
Father tqrecommend a few lecturers for
Indian consurption. The president was
thoughtful a moment, and then asked if
they iad ever heard of Conklin,,. He
said Conkling was a chief of the Oneidas
a regular hair-litter on the rostrum, and
he could go highly recommended by a
brother lecturer named Curtis, whose
scalp he had recently taken in the most
scientific manner. lie mentioned several
others that he could spare just as well as
not'to go out and lecture among the In
dians-Bllaine, Dana, BF:n Intler. Private
Dalzell, etc. The chiefs were delighted,
and said they would insure each and all
a warm reception. Conversation then
took a general turn. The Great F t her
then asked:thenm if they nusually bought
their pianos on the monthly payment
system, and how it worked, and whether
with a little government assistance, they
couldn't build factories, andl manufacture
musk for their pocket handkerchiefs from I
the original musknmelon cheaper than u
they can import it. He intimated that if
the Indian over expected to compete set -
cessfully with his white brother, he mnm.t
educate himself for the insurance busi
new, become president of a Chicago sa
viogs bank, or get hilmself elected to Cot:
greas. The chiefs were mutch pleased
with the Great Father and the way lie
talked, and felt emboldened to ask, in I
leaving, if he wouldn't imakie each of themn
a present of an ulster, a cigar case, dia
mond cluster pin and. an English ping.
The Great Father said he would see them
-on their reservation first, and they par
ted with mutual assurances of esteem.
The Dying Party.
[New York Herald.]
Our Bret thought is that the Re
publican party is in a state of disso
Intion. It'is with regret that we no
lice certaip peculiar invariable signs
,f disintegration in this party one of
the greatest that has ever existed u-.
der a legjslative Government. The
greatest party in our history is the
Republican. Its career cann only be
compared to that of the Whigs of the
Revolution, who began by resistance
to an arrogant Ministry and ended
by founding one of the dominant
Governments, of the earth. If the
Whig of the Revolution founded the
nation the Republicans saved it. To
the Republicann we owe our exis
tence not merely as a free people, but
as a self-respecting and . world res
pecting people. The sympathy of
the people witl go rather with the
President, who has done a noble and
difficult work, than with those, how
ever illustrious and esteemed, who
use their rare powers to utrderomine
and sap the Administration, know
ing that i it falla the Republican par
ty must be buried in its rains.

their victims had fled, dispersed

Duck Cultivation.
A large suliply of water is not nee
essary to success in rearing ducks,
yet it is quiite a luxury for them, and
in the breeding seasnon it is highly
benticialt ; but ducklings should ieverl
e b allowed al great supply of water
- till they are well fledged. Tiley
- should beo kept in a dry yard, tud
s fed oftei on soft, scalded food. Feed
of themi whole grain till they are well
n- matured. Clear Indian meal is too
ie sitrong for them. Mlix it with wheat
ie bran, tire colrsest, and thoroughly
e scald it. Never feed raw mush to
[i ducks or chicks. If corn and outs are
e ground together and used instead of
corn an d meal, all the better. Ground
t worms are greedaly devoured by them,.
e and should be supplied once a day, if
e convenient.. Spade up the earth in a
Smoist place, and let the ducks pick
s- out the wormsl During the breeding
t season old ducks should only be fed
s- once a day, if they have access lo a
if stream or pond. Feed them at night,
ue and they willilways be found ready
d for their evening meal and can be FL
Seasily secured and kept in till they
o have deposited thlleir eggs, which they
e generally do about the break of day.
- If you want your ducks to supply
you with a goodly number of fertile
eggs, don't over-feed them, but use
the same kind recommlended for
b ducklings with occasionally whole
e grain sparingly. Follow these direc
tions, and success will attend you.
