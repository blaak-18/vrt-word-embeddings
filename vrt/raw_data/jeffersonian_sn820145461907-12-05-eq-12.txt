“A LITTLE 2x4 EDITOR.”
The Live Oak Democrat has the fol
lowing on Governor Broward becom
ing an editor after he steps from
the gubernatorial shoes:
‘‘The rumor that Governor Bro
ward may go into Florida journalism
when he retires from office affects us
most pleasantly. During his term as
governor he has had much to say in
criticism of the press of this State,
and at times has seemed to think it
a sin, per se, for any newspaper
to question the wisdom of his policies.
Now we would like him to get the
benefit of a different point of view
and as editor of a newspaper, see how
far removed from infallibility is even
the chief executive of the State. We
would warmly welcome Editor Bro
ward to our noble fraternity, and
would chuckle with joy to see him
launching his shafts of editorial criti
cisms at some other Napoleon dressed
in a little brief authority who would
promptly report upon him with
blighting scorn by referring to him
as “a little 2x4 editor.” You remem
ber the phrase, Governor? You
didn’t originate it, for it has been
in use for generations by politicians
squirming under press criticism; but
if our memory serves us correctly,
you have hurled that ancient chest
nut at Florida newspapers on more
than one occasion, and we want to
see some Jove on High Olympus up
at Tallahassee hurl it at you a few
times and carefully observe its ef
fects mon a new band at the bel
lows. I- has been so long since we
hoard it Hie first time in our own
cose that we have forgotten the sen
sation. “Little 2x4 Editors’” It
seems severe, hut as a matter of f"H
it is perfectly harmless —a venerable
petrefaction which veteran editors re
gard as something in the nature of a
curio in newspaper museums ?•
point it out to visitors as a speci
men of the now obsolete weapons
used in the ancient warfare of primi
tive journalism.”
And maybe, too, he will consider
seriously some of his charges about
the Florida editors “selling their
editorial space by the inch, with s n
timent thrown in,’ etc. Won’t e-ir
ex-governor editor have a live-wire
rime of it, though, evening up whh
some of us “corporation or influ
enced, owned 2x4’s,” who have dared
to criticise some of his official act'-?
But who still admire whatever of
good there is in him. just as much as
does the St. Augustine Meteor, The
Brooksville Argus, The Arcadia
Champion, and some others that are
always telling the people what “a
good man our governor is.”
THE HAND UNDER THE VELVET
GLOVE.
A story is related of two teams
ters meeting with their teams in a
read in which it •was very undesir
able to turn out on the other side.
Both claimed to have the right of way
and each refused to turn out for
the other to pass. After a long time
spent in fruitless arguments one
said to the other: “Now, if you don’t
move out of the way p. d. q. I'll do
to you as I once did to another fel
low.” This seemed such a serious
threat that the man drove aside and
let his opponent pass. This done,
curiosity led him to ask what terrib
ly punitive method had baen adopt-
ed toward the refractory wagoner,
and feU like kicking himself for hav
ing been so easily intimidated when
he was laughingly told: “The fellow
was stubborn and just wouldn’t get
out of the way, so at last I drove out
of the way myself.”
The state railroad commission has
issued orders to several railroads in
the state to do immediately some
repair work which was most impera
tively needed. And just incidental
ly Chairman S. G. McLendon of the
commission let out the remark that
Mr. J. S. B. Thompson, assistant to
the president of the Southern Rail
way, knew what the commission
would do to those railroads who
should refuse to obey this order, as h
(McLendon) had told him (Thomp
son.) Efforts made to get Mr. Thomp
son to tell what terribly punitive
method the railroad commission held
in reserve having failed, nearly all
the principal railroads in the State
hastened to assure Chairman McLen
don that they were willing and de
sirous of aiding the commission in
doing all that was possible and prop
er to protect the lives of their pas
sengers and employees. There was
only one road which declined, and
received its defiance after the warn
ing threat casually made by the
chairman and guarded as a secret
by Mr. Thompson. The Georgia Rail
road, -whose officials probably re
membered having heard the story of
the two teamsters, through Major J
B. Cumming, politely but most posi
tively refused to comply with the or
deg and defied the commission to
crack its whip and do its worst.
Possibly the sequel of this affair s
will be the same as in the wagoner
story. Possibly what McLendon told
Thompson was that the railroad com
mission was playing a big bluff, and
if the railroads should refuse to obey
its orders the commission -would take
off its hat and say: “Well. gentle
men, if you won’t do what we de
necessary and have required, -we will
step aside and let you do just as ynn
please.” And then won’t the rail
roads which took their warning seri
ously want to get somebody to kick
them, -while The Georgia, smilin'"
over its astuteness in having called
the bluff, will go blithely on with its
rotten ties and misson bolts
counting a terrible catastrophe in its
rails.
But possibly also the railroad com
mission wasn’t bluffing. Possibly its
members had not heard the story of
the wagoners, or did not try to work
this bluff racket. Just a suspicion
that this may be the case is convey
ed by Chairman McLendon’s reply
to Major Cumming that this order of
the commission was in effect a rule
nisi, and that “It is needless for me
to say to you in perfect frankness,
that the Georgia Railroad is not to
be considered by this commission as
an outlaw until it establishes its
claim to that distinction by disobed
ience to the reasonable regulations
and orders of this commission.” Soft
words are these, as soft as the touch
of a velvet glove.
And sometimes a velvet glove is
drawn over a mailed hand. Indeed, it
is generally the case that where in
the case of a controversy one side is
exceedingly gentle in the beginning,
this course is induced by a conscious
ness of its •trength and it* ability t«

inforee its claims, and the prelimi
nary extra gentle touch is but the
processor of the iron grip that is to
follow.
The Georgia Railroad may learn
this to its sorrow, if it persists in its
present course of defiance of the
state railroad commission.—Augusta
Herald.
HE MURMURED.
A few days before parliament rose
for the Easter holidays, it is said that
an influential constituent of a cer
tain honorable member came up to
town.
“I say,” the constituent remarked
confidentially, “I never see your
name in the Times. Don’t you ever
make a speech?”
“Certainly,” replied the member,
who is a humorist in his way, “Lock
here. Here is a full report of
speech of the prime minister, and
the end you will notice, in bruc
‘Murmurs.’ Well, I was the man
who murmured.”
THE EDITOR’S TROUBLES.
The editor who expects to be able
to please everybody had just as well
quit, for he is sure to be disappoint
ed sooner or later. The religious de
partment which we thought would be
appreciated by everybody, but we
find it has its enemies. We would
appreciate it if some knowing citizen
would kindly take our place and let
us have a week’s rest while we vent
our spleen on the quail and mule
eared rabbits.—Santa Anna News.
COURAGE OF A GEORGIAN IN
CAMP DOUGLAS.
By J. N. Hunter, Demorest, Ga.
I was a member of Company K, 2d
Tennessee Cavalry, under Forrest, and
was a prisoner of war in Camp Doug
las from December 22. 1862, to June
19, 1565. On the morning of the 15th
of April, 1865, after the assassination
of President Lincoln, flags were order
ed to half-ma. t. The lanyard of the
garrison flag was caught and hung a
few feet from the top, and could not
be moved either wav. Colonel Sweet,
the post commander, ordered a man
detailed to climb the pole, one hun
dred and eighty feet high, to fix the
rope. The detailed soldier climbed the
pole, but just as he reached the top
and before he could fix the pulley he
lost his hold and fell a fearful fall
to the ground.
The entire garrison of three thou
sand men and thousands of prisoners
witnessed the appalling sight. The
man lived about two hours. On the
morning of the 16th the Colonel called
for a volunteer to climb the pole, but
out of the entire force of three thou
sand men not one Avould volunteer
for the hazardous climb. Then a re
ward of five hundred dollars was of
fered: but, strange to say, no one ac
cepted the offer.
“Try the Johnnies,” said Colonel
Sweet. “Ont of the twelve thousand
prisoners we will find a man who will
climb that pole. The prisoner who
climbs it and adjusts the lanyard and
flag shall have five hundred dollars
and transportation home at once.”
Barracks No. 1, near the gate, was
called out, one hundred and fifty in
number. The proposition was ex
plained and a volunteer •ailed f*r.
Instantly a lean, lank, ragged Geor
gia boy, an artilleryman, about nine
teen yeas old, stepped to the front
and went at once to the flag pole. It
was now the evening of the 16th.
In the prison and garrison and even
in the city, excitement -was intense.
Thousands watched that Georgia bey
climb the pole. The entire garrison
off duty was gathered around the flfg
pole, sailors swarmed in the rigging
of their ships on the lake, and peo
ple on the house tops all watching one
of the most daring and thrilling acts
of the war. The boy from Georgia
reached the top of the pole, swayed
in a gale of w-ind, and in a few sec
onds fixed the rope; then, waving his
old Confederate hat three times about
his head, threw it at the crowd be
low’. A mighty cheer went up as he
started on his descent. The prisoners
caugh it up. and for the first and only
time the Rebel yell was heard in a
Northern prison.
As he came down in reach the Fed
eral soldiers pulled him off the pole
a.nd on their shoulders, carried him to
the provost officer near by, where he
signed the oath,or parole, and there
were handed to him five one-huadred
dollar bills and his transportation pa
pers home. He started homo on that
evening. He had no idea of clipp
ing that flag pole thirty minutes be
fore he started up it. I would ]'’■«
to know who be was, and if he is still
living.—Confederate Veteran.
