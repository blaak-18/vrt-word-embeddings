OUR WAHINGTON LETTER.
WASHIINGTON D). C., Jlue 22, 1878.
Mr. Potter's Corin iittee mwill aCeecin
plih i much in showiug how deltsperite
wele the expedienitrsof tep lulic ii
leadlers ill seening a false connt of
the voties in 1876. It will do its great

on the part of those li'whII share-td Ilie
p)linider. It will slhow, iln ailitionr I.
all I hat reftrmeg r received at di. i
tributed the stolen goods, kinowing
them to have been stolen. We knew,
for instance, that Mr. Hayes had gireti
office to nearly all the pronineont. men
who went South in hi+ ca-'se, and hl;il
rewarded by peace the more itflitiinen
tial Southern men who, after Ti Ien'ý
election, were conspieiouts ill thtirt
efforts to counit haves in Hlt we
did not realize therextett of thle Iar-
gaining that hot awl his intitinate
friends among the retorm ers h:a1 withI
the scnrvy rIogile who did the dirty
work in Florida anti LouisitIn. n "16
form" is a word trhat nill hterenai rIt
ruin the party speaking it.
The regular hbtsiness of the Coin
mittee for the last few days has wt
been of an exciting ciharacter. To
day Mrs. Jenks will testfri. Un
known to most, she has been in the
city for several d;ays atll ill c.Itsttttt
intercourse with the attorney of Sec'v.
Sherman. The ploilnt on whichi she
is to be extamined is as to the exis
tence of a latter, said to have beenI
written by hertuman in which he
pledges protection and reward to two I
Louisiana officials who contemniplaite
making false statements in ordert to
give the State to Ilayes. If the ('Corni
mittee has permitted Slierm;an's at- I
torney to prepare replies for Mrs. I
Jenks it is not likely tlhat her testi
mony will amount to ninchi, what
ever she may know. She is the wo
man said to have had tlhe letter in t
her possession.
Two old Senators are anxious to
get back to their seats. 'lThe are
Chandler, of Michigan, who no donht
wishes for a chance to fight tIhe Ad
ministration, and Pomeroy of iKan.
sas. The place of Chandler is miore t
acceptably filled than when ho ocn. 1'
pied it. Judge Christiancy has le- t
vefoped a great deal of the partisan
of late, but has ability and cihanacter
to which Chandler never aspir InII
the other case, if Kansas matt i a
Republican Senator, the change f(0.
Ingalls so Pomeroy will be a relief t0 "
those who have occasion to be at .tle "
Capitol, and a benefit to the country. tl
I do not mean to praise Pomeroy at b
all in saying this.
The Senate yesterday by a vote of ti
passed 45 to 15 a bill providing that
U. S. notes shall be received the same
as coin for 4 per cent bonds, andafte
October 15th shall be received for
Custom dues. -
An attempt was also made in the v,
Senate to postpone the day of final tl
adjouronment, but a large iajorjrity at
voted against it. Ce
The House for several day past tlI
has been engaged on what is koown` is
as the Sundry Civil Bill, and passed' if
it last night. This, like the river ti,
and harbor bill, is always "inflated" bt
after it gets before the Hounse. Joes re
accommodates Smith and Roblison' B;
by voting for their litte amenddments,
and they in turn favor Jones, and so ,ar
immense sums are added. Now that ,,at
the bill goes to the Senate that body th
will try its hand in the woik of swell de
ing the amount.
There are but four dais left of tie a
session, and this and the Almy F an
propriation bill get but hasty enasi 8g
deration. tu

Some Facts. se
The New Orleans Delta furnishes an
us with some interesting data which tat
tends to transfix Mr. Stubbe, the anti- It
Convention apostle from Onachira,
as an "interested" individnal. The eX
ther
Delta says: "Itis not an unfair infer
ence that Senator Stubbs has a person- wh
al and individual interest, like many gal
others in this State, in keeping things so
as they are. Unless lie hlay shoved
them off, he is no doubt draihsg tec
annually out of the State Treastry a lici
large sum of money in the shape of wh
State Bonds which the generosity(I) the
of our law-makers of ISfi6 and I872, iu(t
induced them to donate to Mr. Stubbs on

When the Democratic press of this so
State was assailing Chief JnisticeF Lde- we

road fraud, and sparing their partners of wl
Democratic proclivities, the formner were Il
in the habit, whenever they had an otq- \ 1
