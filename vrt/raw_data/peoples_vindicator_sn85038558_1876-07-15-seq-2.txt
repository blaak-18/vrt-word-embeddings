Radical Actions.
The Radical pat fy after mighty ex
erltiolns; after solemn lip promise; 4
after quihes of paper pledges, that f
none but honest, none but capable 1
men should receive office, or nomina- t
tion for office, have placed in the t
field a ticket worse in character, more
disgrace.ful in ability than any they I
have ever presented for the suflerages
of the people of Louisiana.
Packard, who leads, is the symbol .
of (alitism-thl e bead and front of
all offending towards the whites of
the State. He is the mall wlho plan
ned and execnted the dastardly raids
upon our citizens of North Louisiana
in 1874 with United States Cavalry.
Tl.e man who crowded the dungeons
of the Orleans Parish prison with in
nocent amen front Grant parish; who
Sassisted Bieckwith, the notorious, to
eram negro witnesses with foul per
ju'ies against our fellow-citizens,
wh!o packed jnurics in the interest of
his panty--whose Deputies rode
r rough-shlod over our parishes, lmur
dering wlRi:te men and ravishing ladies,
who is in fact, the sordid, cold-blood
ed brain of all the villainies that have
a been heaped upon as as a people.
° This is the mark that Radicalism in
t its blasphemy of every thing honest,
honorable and virtuous,' sets up as
their champion reformer, and proposes
to cram into power by the free use of
the bayonet and Retuhrning Board,
for at the ballot box his defeat will
be overwhelmning.
Every virtuous man, woamn and
_ child were aroused last week when
the news flashed over the wires that
, this fiend had been selected as the
Radical standard bearer. *
Deep, unutterable indignation filled
every manly breast, and the deter
r ination went up from the vast body
of Louislana's Conservative citizens
to rise as one tian and hurl this fel
low and his followers to deep oblivion
in November next.
Look then who follows: Antoine, a
simple pated negro, and Brown, the
robber and excuser of robbers of the
School fund of the State, and Honore
and Johnson, conglomorated imbe
cility and Carpetbagism, with the
renegade Hunt, as Attorney General,
whose Benedict Arnoldisni only
serves to make the reeking corrupt
ticket more profound in its degreda
tion, these make up the ticket put in
the field in the Centennial year of
American Independence by a party
that would "reform within itself."
This ticket has cleared all doubt
from our minds ; it has firmly united
our people, all people who love and
desire a good, honest and intelligent
government, into one solid, compact,
irresistable body, determined to
sweep from power the last vestigo
of Radicalism.
There will be no faltering now;
virtue anid int.llig.nee will to the
fore; nti in TNovemnber, upon the
plains of Phillipi we will meet that
enemy, the enemy of liberty, ofjns
I tice, and of law, and with oneo exul

rier vice and ignorance have erected
to protect their cowardly and waver
ing lines from the onslaught of the
PEOPLE; we Will storm the eitadel in

We see in a late number of the
Shreveport Times, that Mr. A. H.
Leonard has wandered aronnd in the
fields of despair on the hunt for a
third party long enough, and propao
aes to go in against Radicalism with a
vim. Leonard is a good fellow, and
the cause of complaint against him
is just what he charges against ns, he
is so blindly "visionary and impracti
cable," that hlie sees in all others those
disecordent elements through his'own
gloomy glasses. Leonard, we take it
is high-tonedl and tonehy, got miffed
because the political machine would
not be ran to his liking, got blazing
mad at some one or two men in New
Orleans; charged to the matsle an In

If the demoralization of the hRadi
cal patty, and the desertion of their
former corrupt and infamous leaders
by the negroes, exist in other por.
tions of this State to the fearful ex
tent that it does in this parish, we
cannot for the life of us see where
the Randical following is to come from.
We say this, and say it candidly,
challenging a refitatiou, that not 25)

Democratic-Conservative clubs where
4 one belongs to the Radicals, and this
a too, in a parish with 3500 colored
voters,.

1. Brim full of Packard whisky, and
in running over with that grimt hunlor
which would have made a cast-iron
a monkey grin, the Editor-in-chief of
le the Republican, returned from the
1e Convention of mobs in New Orleans,
re and immediately rushed "to pen" in
e. order to work off the exuberance of
Ie his feelings. The wit in those squibs
1, of last week against the VINDICA
,y TOR, will certainly tell on-the hand

. people laughed until they cried, when
u they read them-from a borrowed pa

t of that aggrarian line of argument
d that howls of mechanics and farmers
d in one breath, and gives perfect fits
it to a man that dares assume to an

Big Horn Massacre.
It will be seen by our dispatches
that the forces sent into the Indian I
country under command of Reno, a
Crook and Custer, have met with dis
astrous defeat, and the loss of officers t
º and men is reported to be terrible. º
This loss of soldiers, many of them
cherished, gallant and efficient officers,
can be traced to one grand cause, and
) that is, the imbecility of the Wash
I ington Government. At the very
time of its occnrrance, we are told
B that the President, Secretary of War,
B and Attorney General, were consult
s ing as to the best mode and the most 1
I efficient manner of nsinq troops in the
South during the election. Is this not
di damning, that the President of the
e United States, while at war with bar
;, herons Indians, at the very moment
our gailant officers were being butch
Ih retd without mercy or succor, was
e concocting a develish scheme to over
k run and overawe the the white citizens of
S- the South, that a band of plunderers
and thieves might rob them as it has
done the poor Indian.
H, Have the American people no res
n pect for themselves ; have they sunk
it so low in morals and patriotic feeling
for their country, as to allow this
1e hanmpton and protector of fraud and
n thievery, to set altnly in the Presi
n dential chair and see hundreds of our
Ir gallant soldiers and officers butcher.

port of the thousands of other troops

Something True.
The ideas of the young men of
Louisiana, and when we say young
men we mean as much "advanced
ideas" as we do lack t' years, in
fact more, are beginning to tell, both
upon the enemies and in our own
ranks.
We do not say this in any spirit of
I selftilattery-but we do realize the
fact of the growing favor of the vig
orous thoughts that have leen inject
I ed in the body politic of our State,
by its vigorous and active men.
We yield to none the pahlm of vene
t ration for old age, in wine, fathers or
r usages, but at the same time none
twill more unhesitatingly crush an
idol than we, no matter how much
that idol may be venerrated, when
t we are sure the worship of It provokes
no good. We are not a stand still
s either in life or politics, anld we have
never yet met a finished politican, al
f though we have niet many, very ma
s ny, who were wise in all things, but
a the bare fact ot their being consu
mate asses.
We, of the South, are afflicted with
k a snperabundance of Blunsby's in'po
g litics-those non-committal snobs,
s either old or young, who learn a lit
Stle chicanery from a grandpa, have
i. acquired nothing since, and, unfortu
r nately for Louisiana, have remember
ed too well, "early training," These
gentlemen are fastened to the Kan
s sis-Nebraeka Bill or the battle ot
I Petersburg, and for the life of them
e or their country, they cannot crawl
g out of it. They "web up" in life on
some striking event, and bud out a
e worm, wise in its day, but an idiot of
s the hour.
r We learn this every day, when we
i hear men's names mentioned for
Governor of Louisiana. Names are
mentioned in that connection around
which cluster historical romance;
men who in the past were lions,
e whom we venerate and respect,
v but who are at the same time about
) as much fitted for positions now, as
s George Washington would be to di.
re ect an army of breach-loaders, when
his ideas of war were Port Wine and
sa flint-lock musket.
ºt Why, we may as well "wake up"
d some dead father and array him in
Gubernatorial toga as to put in some
t gentlemen we have heard mentioned.
- Do not people know that we live
, but for the future. Our lives are not
r bound to the dead or living of other
e hours-we rear no monuments to is
it sues or men of the past; experience
o to shun danger, avoid evil and assure
,r success, is all we want with history,
n and if we nominate men of the "old
n South" (which God bless and remerlu
I ber for the past) we will have a Gov
e trunment of the "old gouth" in a new
, age-a dead member on a living body.
ri Let us realize the fract, and realize
o it like thie Texas girl, "right now,"'
o that wme are of thoNEW SOU'IEII.
e We must nominate and elect men
I to office, of the hour! and who recog -

Bismarek, July 7--Custer was
surrounded on every side by the
Indians, and horses tfell as they
fought on the skirmish line, in line
of battle. Custer was among the
SIlast who fell, but when his cheering
Svoice was no longer heard the In
dians made easy work of the re
mainder. The bodies of all save
the newspaper correspolltents,
were stripl)ped, and most of them
were horrblly mutilated. Custer
was. shot through the body and
through the head. The troops
cared for tile wounded and buried
the dead, and returned to their
a camp for supplies and instructions
from the general of the army, Col.

ntight with thirty-five of the wound
ed. The Indians lost heavily in
the battle. The Crow scout sur
vived by hiding in a ravine. He
believes the Indians lost more

there were 4000 warriors, (Gen.
