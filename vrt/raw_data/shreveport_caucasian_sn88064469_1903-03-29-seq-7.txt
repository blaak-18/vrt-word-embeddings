CHARIES J. BOATNER.
The States in referring to the death
of Hon. C. J. Boatrer, which occurred
in New Orleans, .where he had resided
several years and was engaged in the
practice of law, says:
"After retiring from political life Mr.
Boatner, who was well trained in the
law, established himself in New Orleans
in the practice of his profession, and
here he made his mark as one of the
strongest advocates at the civil bar. He
represented not only many large and
important interests, but by his energy
and ability built up a large and lucra
ti*e individual proctice.
"The States is quite sure that the peo
ple not only of New Orleans but the
whole of Louisiana will deplore the
death of such a good citizen and kindly
Christian gentleman.
SENATOR MORGAN'S FIGHT.
Senator Morgan's fight on the Pan
ama canal was the remarkable fight of a
remarkable man. He had reasons for
every position he took, and he gave
them honestly and courageously. He
probably knows more about the ques
tion of an isthmian canal than any other
man alive, and whether right or wrong
in his opposition to the treaty which has
.just been ratified, he is universally re
spected, both in the Senate and in the
country. The canal, as at last decided on,
is to be dug over a route which he
would not have chosen and on terms
which he did not like, but, after all,
when finished it will be a monument, £
more to him than to any other one man, I
with the possible exception of Lesseps.
-New Orleans States.
And yet some newspapers claiming
some influence have attempted to belit
tle Senator Morgan because he did not
join the majority in favor of the Pan
ma route. It may be said that any mon- s
key or flunkey may follow the crowd
and make grimaces at the man wheo
would not sacrifice principle for expedi
ency, honor for glittering consideration. t
As the States has well said: "The canal d
when finished will, be a monument more o
to him than tq any other one man, with F
the possible exception of Lesseps." c
SENTIMENTAL GUSH.
S The reunion of Confederate Veterans
- in Newt Orleans in May next gives op
a. portunity for what may be termed "sen
timental gush." The "old warriors" are
peculiar, unique in their persoriality,
and are the exceptions of all exceptions.
Without frills or furbelows, they repre
sent principles which are imperishable,
Ind they need no adulations or mean
ingless praise to hold their fame secure
is the world's historical record. Now
and then. some "gusher" indilg'es in
words like these:
"It is fitting, indeeed, that the young
er gun rtion should make the declining
years of these brave and true men
happy."
And to which should be added: "Pro
vide.d, he is not seeking a political soft
t job." In such event, he must struggle
desperately to keep up and maiftain
himself. But in the great scramble of
flie he still maintains his own simply
betenose he is peculiar and stands as the
exception- of all exceptions. The "old
wartirs" 'appreciate the difference be
tween .sentimental gush and the praise
which is substantial.

WITH THE WRITERS.
Two Aneedotes of Booth Tarknfg
ton--The Real Little Dorrit.
[Special Correspondence.]
Chicago, March 24.- When Booth
Tarkington, the novelist and legislator
of Indiana, was first turned loose from
college, he at once began what he de
scribes as "fussin' with literachoor."
He helped to launch and keep afloat
for a few months an obscure magazine
of the freaky, amateur sort.
This magazine was c('ailled John-a
Dreams and went so far as to construct
out of whole cloth a "lady writer," to
gether with excerpts from her works,
and to serve up to its small public *'an
appreciation" of the same.
Tarkington held the purely honorary
position of staff artist to this publica
tion, and because he disclaimed all
ability to draw he was allowed to sign
his sketches with his real name. Be
cause he made some pretensions to an
ability to write he was compelled to
sign all his literary contributions with
the nom de plume Cecil Woodford.
This, of coursh, was very effective in
keeping Tarkington out of the public
eye and away from public prints-a
service for which he now occasionally
longs as he reads in the daily papers
things he never said and accounts of
things he never did. Such is the story
of his intention to leave social life and
settle down on a farm; likewise the
story of the doughnut factory-though
what he is reported to have said about
it has almost the ring of the true Tark
ington humor.
A friend one day was lounging on
some available space not covered by
various pieces of Tarkingtqn's tem
poriarily castoff clothes. Tarkington
was keeping up a somewhat jerky con
versation. Suddenly he dived into a
bureau drawer and fished up a good
sized roll of manila legal cap.
"That's the start of a new story." he
said, looking at it and handling it for
half a minute as if he didn't know
what to do with it. "I think it's going
to be better than anything I have yet
done. I've got it pretty well roughed
out here. I'm carrying it around in my
gripsack, and if I were to lose it I
couldn't reproduce it."
This was the first manuscript of "The
Two Vanrevels." It had not occurred
to Tarkington tq have it typewritten
and' leave one copy In a safe some
where.
The current revival of interest in
Charles Dickens, his works, his haunts
and in the originals of his most cele
brated characters has resulted in throw
ing the glare of publicity upon an old
lady at Southgate, England,. who has
just passed her ninetieth birthday and
tells how she came to be the originaj
of Little Dortlt.
She is Mrs. Mary Ann Cooper. Her
father, a well to do farmer, had a place
at Sunbury, where Dickens in his ear
ly youth was a frequent visitor.

GOWNS FOR MOURNN~.G
SMany of Them Beautiful .Creations.
Witows May Wear Hats.
We all know that everything, wheth
b er good or bad, has its compensation.
r and therefore we are prepared to find
2 a sort of subdued comfort in elegant
ly cut and fashioned: garments. even
though they are designed to express
t sorrow and moulilng for the dead.
s One might even say tlat the fashion
able .mourning gowns are made more
carefully and beautifully than those
t for ordinary occasions. The skirts are
imade to conform with the most stylish
of the modes of tile dany. IIairclothi
and featherbone give them the fash
ionable flare at the base and cause
them to full in rich folds at the bot
tom. The matrials used vary to a
great extent, according to the age of
the wearer and the degree of relation

f mains the one thing for elegant first

tures of silk and wool mingled or of
silk alone in some clever crape weave.
Fine dull cashmere and a crape cloth
made of mohair and Australian wool.
woven In form of heavy crape, are also
shown.
There is a kind of armure cloth
which makes up into very pretty
mourning gowns when developed with
all the care used in making other hand
some garments. One dress of this kind
is shown at one of the stores. The
skirt, which is just allowed to touch
the floor in the back, has a twelve inch
shaped flounce around the bottom.
This is a little deeper at the back and
Is stiffened in the approved fashion
with a black taffeta ruffle beneath as
a protector. On the flounce is one
band of English crape four inches deep
and above that three rolls of the same
crape, as small as they can be made
The skirt is cut in many gores, every
one of them piped dow.i with the crape.
Where the flounce joins the skirt there
is a flat band one inch wide. There is
a short half fitting coat to wear with
this of the same material. The revers.
cuffs and pocket lids are of the crape.
There is a vest of dull armure silk, and
this is buttoned to the chin with crape
covered buttons. The outside coat.
which is fastened to the vest, is so
made that the flat collar and revers
render some such arrangement neces
sary. Like the poor, the high collars
are always with us. The mode of fas
tening the outside coat to the vest ob-.
tains in many of the new spring 'suits.
Even widows are now allowed by
fashion to wear hats Instead of uncom
fortable litle bonnets. It is not un

flat hat made. it is true, of crape," but
tucked and puffed and ruched into
something like grace and beauty.
There are many vest effects in mourn
ing attire. Perhaps the Wrish to have
something a little less somber has some.
thing to do with it. It is and always
was a pretty fashion. Blouse bodices
are often seen. Under those circum
stances the waist is made ornamental
with tucksand folds of crape and some
times with a little dull chenille ear
broidery. A home gown for a young
widow is made of voile, set over a
taffeta slip. Around the shaped flounce
are narrow rolled bands of crape, two
at the bottom and, two at the top.

ONE HUNDRED AND ON
A Residlentflf New York Has Just
Celebrated That Birthday.
PROUD OFLONGEVITY
Mr. Price Ascribes His Long Sojourn
Upon This Terrestrial Sphere to
Eating His Food Slowly
and Thorough Chewing.
.New York. March 27.--;lrn in 1802,
in this city. Isaac B. Pr'ce has just
celebrated his 101st birthday. During I
life Mr. Price has only once been out- I
side the city limits. He has never
been outside the state: he has never t
ridden on a trolley car, and although j
he has crossed East river many times.
he has never been over Brooklyn
bridge. He takes great pride in his
long life. "I think it due," he said,
"to the fact that I thoroughly masti- r
cate my food and I never used liquor e
or smoked. I chewed tobacco, how. s
ever, since I was a boy. I have al- I
ways taken a full hour to each meal,
sometimes more. If people nowadays
would only take time to masticate
their food properly there would not be
so much trouble from indigestion and
dyspepsia and they would live .longer."
,Mr. Price cast his first vote in 1825
for John Quincy Adams for president.
and has voted in every presidential
election since.

BURIAL IN SCOTLAND.
R gemains of the'Late General MacDonald
to Be Interred in His Native Land.
JoFuw jo Apoq aqJ,--'L, qt.110 's!Jw.
t General Sir Hector MacDona?d. who
committed suicide at the Hotel Regina
here Wednesday, was removed to the
British mortuary chapel, where it will
L await shipment to its final resting
place in Scotland.
The French law requires that bodies
of suicides be iaken to the morgue,
but owing to the urgent desire of the
British officials that the body of the
distinguished offleer be not deposited
in a public morgue, the usual legal re
quirements were waivetd.
t It was said at the British embassy
1 that no orders have been received
- from London concerning the disposi
r tion of the body and it is expected
that the family of the deceased gen
2 eral will make final arrangements.
Both the officials of the British em
bassy and the consulate general of
Great Britain disclaim any knowledge
of the existence of letters which were
reported to have been found in the
room where the general killed himself.
Mr. Ingliss, the British consul gen
r eral, said: "I have been personally as
sured by the commissary of police that
no such letters have been found."
There is evidently a desire on the
part of the officials to shield the mem
ory of the general out of sympathy
for his family.
