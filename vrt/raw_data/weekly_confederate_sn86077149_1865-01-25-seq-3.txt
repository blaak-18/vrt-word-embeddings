before the Senate, Mr. Wright, after stating
be did not deem the second and third reso
lutions germain, moved they be sttrken out.
Mr. La:-si:er spoke of the offensive and in
suhiiig manner in which impressment Had
been very recently carried. n in Granvilhe
county a manner ks.dting oot only to the
citize ns of the county but even to lad.es, and
hniored thr.t. if some relief be m,t extended

ari-e that lnijd lead to 01 -ioomicu. iu mua
trati m of these remarks, Mr. L. went on to
say that when the order was issued in Gran
ville for the ciiix.-ns te surrender their sto:k,
the exc.te toer.t was such that it needed but a
t'lark to arouse such a fl une as would have
.e ftbvrs from the countv., In such
a state of Things it was time to speak out and
let the erovemmeot know that while willing
to pertorm'ali their duty, the people must be
protected lrem offensive and insulting abuses
of the law.
Jr. Wricht said no one was more opposed
loVwtuia go further to put down any im
i.roper action bv a government towards its
people, but ho had objected to the second and
third resedutions as not beiig gcrmatn to the
obket of the resolutions, whkh, as'he took it,
- was to call the attention of Congre'ss to the
improper 111 inner in which the impressment
laws were executed in hopes of pr.;cunng re

if thi and the precceding one were stricken

M bp subserved by the passage of
