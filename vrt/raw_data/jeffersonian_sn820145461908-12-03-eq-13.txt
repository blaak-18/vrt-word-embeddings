The Ad Man’s Galley
By fames Lanier.
If you are interested in post cards,
or if yous boys and girls are making
a collection, you should join the Up-
To-Date Post Card Exchange, which
is advertised on another page. Your
name will be printed in a collectors’
list, and you will get a good collec
tion of beautiful post cards from the
Exchange itself. These cards can be
exchanged with other collectors all
over the world, or sent to their
friends, or added to their collection,
as they think best. For twenty-five
cents you will receive The Weekly
Jeffersonian and Up-To-Date Farming
for three months; your name and ad
dress will be printed on the collect
ors’ list; you will be given the names
of 100 other collectors to exchange
with; and you will get a complete
set of twenty American Girl post
cards. We have seen the cards that
are issued by this exchange, and they
are really beautiful souvenirs. By
taking other subscriptions you can
get a set of fifty foreign cards, or a
trip around the world with Uncle
Sam’s battleships.
Some extracts from a letter writ
ten by an Oklahoma farmer will give
an idea as to the amount of interest
in a game of post cards:
When the post card fad came I was
surprised at receiving my share of
cards. I sent for the American Girl
set, and had my name placed in the
exchange. I soon found I did not
have half enough cards and procured
more. I sent out my cards freely,
and received a deluge of cards since.
Aly mail was a surprise to our rural
carrier. They came from all over the
United States and Canada. I sent a
cotton-picking scene to a lady in the
North, and another lady a winter
mistletoe scene. When I received
their cards one was from a school
girl, and the other from her teacher.
The girl asked if I would send them
a boll of cotton and branch of mistle
toe, as they had never seen either. I
sent them, and w’ill do as much for
any teacher who sends a card, because
they will interest the whole school.
It is the jolliest game' I have played
at for a long time.
“ALBERT WILSON,
There is one point about The Jef
fersonians that our advertisers are
just beginning to see, and that is that
each paper and magazine—each copy
•—has a longer life, a busier life and
a more useful life, than is spent by
most papers and magazines. Most
publications that come to your home
are glanced over by the home folks,
then put aside. They have no perma
nent interest and only a momentary
value.. But The Jeffersonian has a
definite purpose —a message, welcome
or unwelcome, that must be heard.
Perhaps the idea was most clearly
put by a man who wanted us to stop
his paper, because, he said: “When
it comes to the house I’ve got to read
it, and I don’t want to read it.”
He meant to say that he was inter
ested against his will, and his will
was not Jeffersonian-ward. When
this man’s subscription ran out, his
paper ceased coming to him, in due
TSfye Jeffersonian
course of time. About two weeks
afterward he was trying to discuss
the situation with the local politi
cians and found out that his want of
'■emirate political knowledge was a
handicap. He had missed two or
three numbers of The Jeffersonian,
and he was not as -well posted as the
other fellows. Then came a dollar
bill in an envelope, with his name
and address —not a word of explana
tion. But we happened to get hold
of the story —and it has a moral.
If you want an encyclopedia of po
litical information, get Mr. Watson’s
“Political and Economic Handbook.”
It is a. volume of 360 pages, well
printed and illustrated, with a com
plete index covering every topic of
importance. ’ The Jeffersonians re
ceive many letters asking for explana
tion of such terms’ as “watered
stock,” “eminent domain,” etc. All
these are thoroughly explained in Mr.
Watson’s Handbook, not by other
technical terms and tables of dry sta
tistics, such as you will find in the
ordinary book of reference, but in a
pleasant, readable way, so that the
man of average education and intel
ligence may not be at a loss to un
derstand. We will send you the
book, free of all charge, if you will go
out among your friends and get three
of them to subscribe to either one of
the Jeffersonians —Magazine or Week
ly —and send us the three dollars.
You will notice that The Jefferso
nian has started a column of “Clas
sified” advertisements. This is in
tended for people who can describe
their wants —either to buy or sell —in
a few lines. If you have some choice
cotton seed, or a patented article, or
a new wrinkle of any kind that the
readers of The Jeffersonians might
be interested in, write out a descrip
tion in as few words as possible, add
your name and address, and then
send us one cent for each word. If
you can compress your ideas into 25
words, and you want the ad to run
for a month, send us a dollar. This
is one of the best “Want” columns
in the South today. Try it.
We want our agents to understand
that they can make any combina
tion of magazines with the Jefferso
nians, and we will give them the ben
efit of the trade discount, which is
never less than 25 per cent on any
magazine or weekly paper, and our
regular agent’s commission on the
Jeffersonians. For instance, if a man
wants any dollar magazine with the
Jeffersonians, the agent will remit us
75 cents in addition to his price for
our publications, and if there is any
further discount we will give him
credit for it. We will furnish any
combination of magazines or papers
as cheaply as any agency in the
country, provided the Jeffersonians
are included.
One of the brightest farm papers
that comes to us is the Progressive
Farmer, edited by Clarence H. Poe,
at Raleigh, N. C. Each number con
tains some notable articles by agri
cultural experts, and there is also an
editorial page or two, on which Pro
fessor Massey will personally answer
inquiries on farm subjects. We have
just made arrangements to club the
Progressive Farmer with The Week
ly Jeffersonian for $1.25 a year for
both papers.

“By George, I never saw anything like
the effects of that new treatment, Protone,
for the building up of weight and lost
nerve force. It acted more like a miracle
than a medicine,” said a well known gen
tleman yesterday in speaking of the revo
lution that had taken place in his condi
tion. “I began to think that there was
nothing on earth that could make me fat.
I tried tonics, digestives, heavy eating, di
ets, milk, beer and almost evervthing else
you could think of, but without result. I

had been thin for years, and began to think
it was natural for me to be that way. Fi
nally I read about the remarkable processes
brought about by the use of Protone, so 1
decided to try it myself. Well, when I look
at myself in the mirror now, I think it is
somebody else. I have put on just 30 pounds
during the last month and never felt
stronger or more ‘nervy’ in my life.”
Protone is a powerful inducer of nutri
tion, increases cell-growth, makes perfect
the assimilation of food, increases the num
ber of blood-corpuscles, and as a necessary
result builds up muscles and solid, healthy
flesh, and rounds out the figure.
For women who can never appear stylish
in anything they wear because of their
thinness, this remarkable treatment may
prove a revelation. It is a beauty maker
as well as a form builder and nerve
strengthened
It will cost you nothing to prove the re
markable effects of this treatment. It is
absolutely non injurious to the most deli
