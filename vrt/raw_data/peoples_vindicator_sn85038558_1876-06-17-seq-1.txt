How to Dry Figs.
- At tie Inst session of the Frni!
I, Growers' Association of Florida, held
e in Jacksonville, Dr. Z. H. Masonl,
e who has had nmany years' experience,
v in the business, communicated the
if following process for drying figs and
n preparing them for market. As figs
z. grow in Louisiana in the greatest
I abutdance; and as there are thou
d sands of lbushels of this deliionus
e fruit annually lost, from ignorance as
to this preparation so that they will
d keep, i)r. Mlason's process should be
n given a trial by all means during the
rt coinilg season:
y The preparation of the fig for mar
e ket is so simple that any iamily hav
k ing the trees may succeed. They re
n quire no sugar of syrup-as thie fruit
ro dries it forms its own sugar. The
id greatest amnoullt of labor and tron
n btle is in gathering; if picked by
is hand it will be found a tedious pro
cg cess. The best plan is to hold a sheet
rs under theotrees, then slake the limbs
a. hard enoughl to make the ripe fruit
iI- fall. Do not place the sheet upon
i- the ground, as the ripe figs will burst
ae open and be ruained for drying. Pre
is pare a bath of strong lye, made from
le potash, such as will swim an egg;
ad have this boiling hot ; put the figs in it
lae basket and dip in the lye for two
ig minutes, then dip them in clear wa
l- ter ; let them dip a short time and
ed they are ready for drying. The rea.
:e. son why they are placed in the boiling
Rd lye is to destroy the acrid gun in the
td skin, and to destroy the color of the
pir purple fig. If dried in the open air,
ti. hurdles should be made with narrow
sh elats, upon which to place tile fruit.
lie Keep them in the sunshine as much
em as possible to facilitate rapid drying,
s Thie second day you can flatten the
. figs by pressing them with file hands.
to The hurdles with the fruit on thema
in must be placed under shelter at night,
p, or when it ralms. The objection to
ek drying ii the open air is, that a fly
e- lays its egg in the fruit, and in a
it- short time they become wormy; this
ihe can be obviated by heating them in
ist an oven or stove, just hot enough. to
)r. destroy the vitality of the egg, but
,re not eonough to candy the fruit.
as. It requires a little practice to know
:et when the fruit is dry enoughl;
is. they should be soft enough to pack
ek close in a box with moderate pressure;
Ine keep better wlhen packed close and
of are freer fronm the attack of insects.
be The boxes should contain from ten
ads to fifteen pounds, as in masses of this
in. size they are not likely to become Ory

rv- use oak, cypress or gain, but do.not
me use pine, as it will iupanrt a turpen

1bis Bleaching Cotton.--It is a well esm
ar- tablished fact that cotton cloth that
ty. is bleached by chemical process be
fore it goes into market does not
wear as well as that which is un
vo- bleached, and is very liable in time
lity to tue yello*; also it is very much
s a harder to sew ulpo it. I have for
lied some years past used tie unbleached
iae. in preference. Sheets and pillow
ake cases can be made up far quicker be
and fore cotton hIas been wet., and allow
r to ance can be made for shrinking; in
and deed, any garment can be made if
la this item is borne in mind. Make a
nay good suds of soft water and lye soap,
atl, if you have it ; put the cotton cloth
are in cold suds, and bring it to a boil;
our thien take tle cloth or garmenet out,
rob and when cool spread out oa the
ade snow or grass. lHave a tub of ends
and close by so as to dip the goods in
oitl once ench diay. In thlree days they
will be bleachled to a snow whitenaess,
and keep white till worn out. This
cur' is the way our grnandmotlers bleach
ed their marvelons webs of linen and
damask, and it is too good a practice
lth to be forgotten, or go out of use.
nar- When the -apple-trees are in bloom,
be- spread out garments lthat have turn
ed yellow, after boiling in suds, and
thley will be eleansed white as snows
