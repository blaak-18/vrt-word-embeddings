any better. It is the same in the fac
tory and office. A job is getting to
be such a precious scarce article that
it is taken, must be taken, at any
cost.
No, it is capitalism which is break
ing down the race lines, not Social
ism.
I think it may fairly he asserted,
without fear of contradiction by any
one, that the Socialists believe that
those who produce, either with brawn
or brain, should receive the whole
product of their toil.
They have published a platform
which sets forth what they propose
to do in order to bring about this
state of affairs. Now, it seems to
me it is up to you, or any of our oth
er opponents, either to deny the first
fundamental right, or else point out
how the carrying out of our plan, as
set forth in this platform, would fail
to accomplish this. A discussion
along these lines would be fair and
profitable, and could not fail to be
of interest to all the workers. But
you do not do this. You do not de
ny the fundamental right which we
claim, and you do not in a single in
stance quote from our platform and
explain why the proposal made will
not make toward this end.
(Answer: It is a youthful de
lusion to contend that social equal
ity can be withheld, where economic
and political equality are given.
Capitalism is not obliterating the
color line. On the contrary, the an
tagonism of the races continually
deepens. It has invaded New Eng
land itself, and has made • converts
to the Southern view of such men as
President Taft, ex-President Roose
velt, Charles Francis Adams. A more
recent convert is Collier’s Weekly.
The “color line” was never more dis
tinct, and is even now winning a
great victory in the British Parlia
ment.
As to the laborer’s receiving the
“whole product of his toil”, the de
mand ignores the facts. No man can
produce anything but the most prim
itive and comparatively valueless
articles without the co-operation of
others. Then productions of yester
day aid us to produce the things of
today. Even in the simplest forms
of agricultural production, the la
borer must depend upon the work of
others who have cleared the land,
created a farm out of the primeval
wilderness, manufactured the plows
and hoes and spades and shovels,
rakes, axes, hammers, saws, etc., etc.
Then, again, he is indebted to others
for cutting the trees that were sawed
into the lumber which is used to
make a house for the laborer and
his family to live in while he is cul
tivating the crop. Then, again, oth
er people grew the cotton or the
wool which was manufactured into
the cloth, out of which other toilers
made the clothing which the farmer
and his family wear. So with the
provisions he eats while cultivating
his crop, and the furniture in his
house, and the crockeryware on his
table, and the beds and bedding, the
harness for the mule, the wagon, the
fertilizers, and the medicines that
stave off disease, or cure it after it
comes. Before a farmer can bring
to market a bale of cotton or a bush
el of wheat, he has to use the prod
ucts of the toil of thousands of other
producers!
Did you ever think that out, Mr.
Raoul?
