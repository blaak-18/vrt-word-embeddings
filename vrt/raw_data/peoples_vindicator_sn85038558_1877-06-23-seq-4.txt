THE COUNTRY PRESS.
What is Doing Throughout the
State.
Crops in the Parishes.
Caldwrcll Herald-The Editor of
the Herald has been the recipient
of beets, beef, apples and pluns.
Fine rains have fallen all over
the parish.
Lincoln rentinel-The manager
of the Seatinel proposes to adver
tise all lands for sale in Lincoln
parish with the understanding
that the advertising rate is not to
be paid unless the land sells. So
you see if thereis no good done by
adrvertisiug there will be no pay
required.
We have seen very hard times
financially before, but money mat
ters are screwed up a little tighter
now than wb ever expected to
meet with in this country.
Ouachila Telegraph-A. A. Gun
by, Esq., has been appointed by
Gov. Nicholls, under the law con
solidating the; State University
and the Mechanical and Agricul
lural College, a member of the
Board of Supervisors. We have
not been able to endorse many of
the appointments made by Gov.
Nicholls, but the appointment of
Mr. Gunby we do endorse and
very. cordially.
Richland Beacon-A cotton stalk
was brought to this office on Tues
day, from Dr. Ryan's plantation,
which is under the management of
Mr. Win. Ilearsey, that measured
27 inches from the. end of the tap
root to the end of the stalk, and
when pulled up contained eigh
teen squares,
Coushatta Citizen- We notice a
finue crop of weeds growing in every
part of town. A litle "chopping
out" and liberal use of lime might
save much sickness and suffliring
during this summer.
That "shower," lasting nearly
the entire night of Thursday, will
benefit crops in this section more
than most of us would think.
!rain was needed, and we had all
that suffering crops required.
Claiborne Iliad-An occasional
tramp is seen upon the streets.
This pest is becoming more conm
muon. We fear that they will soon
amtllict us to as great an extent as
they do the people of more north
ern States.
Fishing is said to be fine on
Bayou 1)orcheat. But the mos
qlitos are worse than they have
been known for forty-five years.
The Mayor of Homer is entitled
to the Blue ribbon, he having pro
iphesied rain on the 5th. Prompt
l) to the time, at one o'clock on
t he morning of the fifth, came the
first rain for over five weeks. The
rain seems to have been a general
m,.me, and comes just when it will
do the greatest good.

Dear Sir :-When in Aiken, last winter, I used your
Expectorant for my cough. and realized more benefit
from it than anything I ever took. I am so well that
I will not go to Florida next winter as I intendeod.

This oertilfes that I have recommended the use of
Dr. Tutt'F Expectorant for diseaser of the lungs
for the past two years, and to my knowledge many
bottles have been used by my patients with the hap
piest results. In two ases lwhere itwas thought con
firmed consumption had taken place the Expoetorant
effected a cure. IR.H. BPRAGUE, M.D.
