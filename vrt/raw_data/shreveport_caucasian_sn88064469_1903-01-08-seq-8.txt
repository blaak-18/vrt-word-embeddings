German Commodore Tells of Seizure
of Sailing Vessels.
ACTION CONDEMNED,
A Berlin Journal Condemns Action as
Barbarous and Quotes a Speech
of Von Benlow Relative to
Private Property.
Berlin, Jan. 7.--Commodore Scheder
telegraphs that the Germans on Satur
day seized a large number of Vene
zuelan sailing vessels at Porto Ca
bello. The prizes were towed to Lo::
Rogues, where they remain under
guard. Otherwise there have been no
developments at Porto Cabello.
Commodore Scheder, in his dispatch.
made no mention of the seizure of th,
customshouse at Porto Cabello.
The captured vessels being private
property the Vossische Zeitung con
demns the action of the commolore a'

approves of the seizure.s a, l qlIuot

WHO ARE THE EIGHT THOUS
AND?
(By W. W. Smith. A. M., LL. D.)
The second edition of "Who's Who
in America" (from press of A. N.
Marquis & Co., Chicago) contains 1300
pages of brief biographies, without eu
logy. criticism or comment, of such
persons now living in America as have
become noted as factors in the progress
and achievement of the age. "Endea~vor
has been made," say the editors, "to
include all Americans of more than
local note in all lines of useful effort."
No name is inserted or omitted for
financial considerations; the book is
sold on its merits.
With a view to determining what ef
fect education of the various grades
has had on success in life, effort was
made to ascertain the school training
of each of these men and women "of
more than local note" and 7.852 on their
United States list were thus educa
tionally classified.
According to the best estimate we
can make fromti the latest census returns
there are in the United States 4o.780oo07
persons over at years old. These are
divided educationally about as follows:
Class i, without school train
ing ...... ............. 4,682.498
Class 2, with only common
school training ... ........32,862,951
Class 3, with common and
school training ... ....... 2,165,357
Class 4, with college or higher
education added ......... I,071,201
Now the question is how many of the
eight thousand distinguished citizens of
the United States on the Who's Who
list came from each of these classes.
The 4.682,498 of class t fur
nished ... ... ............... 31
The 32.862.901 of class 2 fur
nished ... ... ... ........... 808
The 2,165,357 of class 3 fur
nished ... . . ... ........... 1,245
The 1,o71,2oi isf class 4 fur
nished ................... 5,768
It thus appears:
1st. That an uneducated child has
one chance in ISo,ooo of attaining dis
tinction as a factor in the progress of
the age. I
2d. That a common school education
will increase his chances nearly four!
Ord That a high-school training will]
inirease the chance of the common
school boy twenty-three times, giving
him- eighty-seen times the chance of
the uneticateld.
4th. That a college education in
crrases the chance of the high school
boy nine times, giving him two hundred
isnd nineteen times the chance of the
t .s shool boy and more than
u red times the char of the
- "notables" thus gathered, 4,8io proved
to be full graduates of colleges.
From the nature of the case it can not
be~claimed that these figures are exact,
but they are based upon the most re
liable government statistic:: and the
necessary estimates have been made
with care. It is also doubtless true that
other circumstances contributed to the
success of these college trained men,
but after all reasonable allowances are
made the figures still force the conclu
sion that the more school training the
child has the greater his chances of dis
tinction will be.
TRANSFERRED TO FLORIDA.
It has been announced that Mr. Lake
Jones, postoffice inspector, has been
transferred to the Floritla division at his
own request. His transfer is regretted
by his friends in Shreveport and
throughout this section. Mr. Jones is
an efficieaft officer and a deservedly
popular .gentleman. His successor is
Mr. D. W. Peters of New Orleans, who.
with his family, are registered at the
Phoenix hotel. Mr. Peters and his fam
ily are welcomed heartily.
