IS THE SOUTH GLAD IT LOST?
“ Had the Confederacy been given the slightest hint of
what was in store for us, the flag would never have been
furled at Appomattox I ” declares Mr. Watson in an answer he makes
to the speech of Secretary of War Dickinson, made on Memorial Day at
Gettysburg, in which speech the Secretary pours out great quantities of rhet
orical oil of joy, and conveys the intimation that the South felicitates herself
upon having lost the cause. All lovers of the truth of American history, to
say nothing of those who revere the traditions of the South, should read this
editorial in the August Magazine.
FOREIGN MISSIONS
The same number completes the FOREIGN MISSION series of articles
by which the press and pulpit of the entire country have been aroused.
Needless to say, the last is the best and caps the climax of the entire subject.
Zack McGhee's Great Novel
“THE DARK CORNER”
will begin with the August mumber and run until the story is completed.
This is one of the brightest and most entertaining works of fiction seen in a
decade. It is distinctly a tale of the back-woods south, as we all know if,
and yet unlike the work of our Southern writers. It is a story of the present
day life and conditions. Mr. McGhee has had the consummate art to sug
gest just such types as we are familiar with, and which afford us so much
delight to meet in the wonderland of literature, and yet he has not slavishly
followed any of the usual lines of treatment.
THE PLANTERS’ WAR IN TENNESSEE
by Harriet Parks Miller, is a masterly, sympathetic presentation of the whole
night-rider situation, and places the subject in a newer, fairer light.
Other editorials, stories and features make up an unsurpassed collec
tion of masterpieces in prose and verse.
