School teachers come forward and

Green, of Campte, writes a letter
to Mr. Lusher soliciting a school, and
cites Blunt and Keeting as references
as to character. If he had included
Myers we have no doubt MIr. Lusher
would have fainted from overpower
ing emotion. Green is greener than
we thought he was, Kellogg and
Packard are not IN and Blunt and
Keeting ain't good endorsement.
If it is our turn, we would say to
the Reporter of Mansfield that we do
not endorse the action of the Ohio
Democrats in pledging the party to
oppose all internal improvements by
the general government, if they hare
done so ; nor do we endorse the Re
publicans of Ohio either who have
gone farther than the Democrats in
denouncing those improvements.
The "Immigration Bureau" is an
other one of those State institutions
run in tile interest of New Orleans
and the "Tehe country." North Lou
isiana pays taxes to the State govern

but she enjoys very little benefit from
the State Government. Why is this?
We beg to call the attention of tax
payers to the notice of Mr. Johnson,
Assessor of this parish. Tile law plo
vides for filing the Tableau with the
Recorder of the parish for thirty days
and dll corrections must be made
within that time.
T Ii E CA ir1l'iLLAn. - Although
thO lto "tell destroyers" have appear
ed in considerable number the farm
ers do not appear to be demoralized
thereat, but, like brave soldiers, they
are getting ready with the "Paris
Green" to poison the pests. If there
is any hing in observation no hai-r
need be apprehended, if the poison is
applied, before the middle or latter
part of next month.
IsmnMRATIro N.-WouId it not add
to our material prospem-ity if we made
a move to get immigrants here;
would it not show, at least that we
really wanted them. We would sug
gest a meeting and discussion of the
question in order to "agitate," for
by agitating we will succeed. Will
not some leading citizen take the first
step?
CAMPTE.-This village situated on
Red River, ten miles from Natchito
ches and in our parish, is steadily im
proving. New stores have been built
while others are in course of erection.
Merchants there do a large business,
and the shipments from that point
are of some importance. Nestled on
the red banks of Red river with green
fields on either side and in rear of it,
the white buildings present quite a
picturesque appearance. The inhab
itants are thrifty and enterprising
ana ceLtaluly tebsvitv applanoe for
building so neat a town.
RED RIVER is extremely low from
this out, so low indeed as to rendtr I
navigation extremely difficult, and
then it continues to fall! Notwith
standing all this, we do not charge
the low water to Tones Bayou, as our
confreres of the Times do. Tones
Bayou has had everything to bear;
has had numerous things thrown at
it, logs, dirt, newspaper squibs, and
about $35,000 in government green
backs, but this last onslaught of the
Shreveport Times River .- mai, is too
much. We would rather say that the
current has not had time to cut out a
channel through the sandbars, and
the low water navigation will be
much better in a month from this,
than at present, if the body of the
water continues to fall.

Russian positions are yet safe. The

The report of a soveic tdefeat of tue
Russians at Tirnova originiateti in tie
repulse of a small Rusian force by
Osman Pasha's troops at Lovatz, on
the river Osmo, a fewv miles south
east of the Turkish fortifications at
Plevna.
The Russianis have massed 70,000
troops around Plevna, preparatory to
another attack, wvhichr owing to the
strength of the Turkish position,
must be a bloody one. The river Vid
protects the town in the rear, while
clusters of hills embrace it on the
east, affording ever3- natural advan
tage for earthrworks, and the Turks
have fully availed thiemaohvas cuf the
fortunate topography.
It is probable that the Egyptian
troops furnished by the Khedi ye for

in force. King John is a ferocious

riot do to trifle or oppose with half
measures. Thre result of the Egyp
tian campaign against him last year
was sufficiently disastrous to suggest
the idea that an Abyssinian invasion
of Egypt means some bloody work
King John is remorseless in his bad
treatment of prisoners; and his army
in well-trained and ivehl-armed and
equipped.
