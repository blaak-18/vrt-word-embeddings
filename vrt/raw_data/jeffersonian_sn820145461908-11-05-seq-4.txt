STRATAGEMS AND SPOILS “By John Nan son Charlotte
Compared with the paper of today,
with its superb equipment of power
presses, linotypes, mailing machines,
leased wires and long-distance tele
phone connections, the old-time coun
try weekly was primitive indeed, and
limited in its facilities, but it pos
sessed rare excellence, for its chances,
and was, as it claimed to be, devoted
to the interests of its State and sec
tion. It was intensely conservative
and viewed innovations with caution,
even with distrust. It was pictur
esque and somewhat pompous, an
nouncing its purpose and mission
with the sonorous roll of verse, in
such mottoes as these: “Hew to the
line, let the chips fall where they
may ’'; or, 41 My country—may she al
ways he right; but, right or wrong,
my country”; or this:
“This Argus o’er the people’s rights
Doth an eternal vigil keep;
Not all the strains of Maia’s son
Can lull his hundred eyes to sleep.”
The Clarion was a fair representa
tive of the better class of the coun
try weekly. The paper had in its
earlier days enjoyed the distinction of
being the mouthpiece of a man who
had made the successful voyage from
the executive mansion in Columbia to
the United States Senate. That was
in the days before the Civil conflict
when papers were scarce in South
Carolina. In the stormy days of the
late sixties and early seventies the
Clarion was pronouncedly an •'‘or
gan,” which meant probably then, as
now, a paper more or less inclined to
partisanship. At this particular pe
riod the Clarion was edited by Col
onel Stillman, whose name was by no
means an index to his temperament.
Stillman was a politician; an office
holder primarily, instinctively; that
is to say, he had been an office-holder
before the blacks and carpet-baggers
had got hold of the ship of state and
were riding her so roughly over the
choppy seas of political incendiarism
and intrigue. iSo, according to the
political faith of Colonel Stillman the
government had been usurped, and he
made it the mission of the Clarion to
wrest this power back where he be
lieved it belonged.
The Colonel’s only “staff man”
was a youth with an ambition to be
something and do something. 11 Rush, ’ ’

said the colonel to the boy when he
was about to initiate him into the
mysteries of the Fourth Estate, “you
are about to come into a profession
that is as great as the law, as high
as the church, and sometimes as dir

boy, is the kindergarten of experience,
the high school of finance, the acad

salary I give you and work like the
devil. I reckon you get the idea?”
1 ‘Yes,” answered Rush, laconically,
and he went to work next day.
Rush took hold with an energy that
was commendable and a knack that
was surprising even to himself. In a
few months’ time the colonel felt safe
in leaving the Clarion in Rush’s
hands for whole issues at a time, and
with the assistance of old man
Knowles, who had been foreman for
quarter of a century (and who, with
the office “devil,” constituted the
mechanical force), Rush found little
difficulty in making his issues on
time.
It was in the year 1878. Those who
are familiar with the history of South
Carolina since the sixties will recall
that there was considerable voting
done at an election in 1876. A good
ly number of the ballots cast on this
occasion were polled at the Edge
field box; indeed it was conceded that
Edgefield saved the day for the
White Man’s government. The elec
tion two years later, in 1878, was also
an important and exciting contest,
and was as fiercely contested by the
contending political parties as the
election of ’76; indeed this was the
crucial test, as the negroes made a
last desperate effort to get back into
power, and it was only after another
superhuman struggle on the part of
the whites that they were prevented
from doing so. In this election, as in
’76, Edgefield “did her whole duty.”

It was the morning of election day.
From all over the State came whisper
ings that the negroes had organized
of his life a teafaring man because
he loved the rollicksome nomadic ex
istence common to those whose lives
are spent upon the waters.
Close following the days of recon
struction he is said to have boarded
the ship “Kate Hooper,” and sailed
out from the Golden Gate of the Pa
cific bound for China. En route they
made several stops. First at Singa
pore, a small port on the Malacca is
land, where they took on a cargo of
sandalwood, mahogany, and some oth
” commodities.

and would attempt to carry the elec
tion by force, aided and abetted by
certain unscrupulous white men. Up
in Columbia the legislature was still
in session, the blacks lacking only
nine votes of having a majority. The
political complexion of the State was
blue, that is, that part of it which
was not black.
The polls had opened at sunrise,
and the voting place was quickly sur
rounded by negroes. It was evident
that it was their intention to mass,
themselves around the polls and thus
prevent the whites from voting. In
fact, that was the plan of the blacks,
to hold the polls as long as possible.
The true status of affairs soon be
came known. People crowded the
Clarion office seeking the colonel in
the hope that he might have a sug
gestion to offer giving a solution of
the difficulty.
After half an hour’s discussion,
during which each citizen grew more
and more exasperated, the colonel
and several leaders were discussing
the advisability of an armed attack,
when Rush injected himself into the
discussion and declared his belief
that he could run every negro away
from the polls without firing a shot.
The crowd was constrained to laugh
at first, but after Rush had explained
his plan the leaders agreed to let him
try it.
Rush selected a few discreet men
and told them his plan in detail and
instructed them as to what part he
wanted them to play. He then went
to the drug store and purchased a
stick of shaving soap, being particu
lar to specify one that would ‘ 1 lather
freely.” Cutting the piece of soap in
two he put half of it in his mouth
and commenced chewing vigorously.
He soon had a copious froth, or
lather, around his lips, to which he
added a pinch of dyestuff to give it
the color of blood, and then he de
clared himself ready for business. In
the meantime those who had been
posted had been circulating among
the whites and telling them what was
coming, so they were in a measure
prepared for what followed.
In a few minutes Rush came run
ning wildly down the street, frothing
at the mouth and apparently having
a convulsion at every jump. Some of
they sailed around south of Borneo,
on through the Pass of Molucco, and
finally reached the Palaos isles, lo
cated within the tenth parallel, and
now a possession of Germany.
Then, as now, those groups were
restful-looking little parts of the
world. And the morning the “Kate
Hooper” landed, the atmosphere all
around was delightfully fragrant with
odoriferous blossoms. Trees of trop
ical growth, and vines, plants, and
palms were to be seen in the most
beautiful and wild luxuriance.
Also multitudes of birds of gor
geous-hued plumage were to all ap
pearances as much at home there as
those who had been initiated into the
plan began shouting, “Madman!
Madman! Hydrophobia! Get out of
his way!” while others closed in
around him and a seemingly terrific
struggle followed, but Rush threw
them off and continued his wild ca
reer, still foaming at the mouth and
snapping at every one he passed. He
headed straight for the negroes.
Colonel Stillman was dancing about
on the edge of the crowd brandishing
a colossal horse-pistol, and shouting
at the top of his voice: “That man
has been bitten by a maddog, and has
hydrophobia. Get out of the way and
let me shoot him before he bites
somebody. ’ ’
The negroes didn’t seem to realize
what was in the air till Rush got
mixed up in the thickest part of the
crowd, and the young reporter put
his hands on the shoulders of a big
negro, and giving a vault landed on
top of the mass of blacks. They were
packed so closely that he couldn’t
get to the ground, so he crawled
around on the heads and shoulders
of the negroes and threw lather all
over the whole congregation, all the
time giving vent to a weird sort of
howl. After he got started he de
cided to play the game to the limit,
so he picked out the cleanest looking
ear he could find and took hold with
his teeth and stayed there. Rush fig
ured that the soap in his mouth would
act as a disinfectant and he knew his
friends wouldn’t allow him to be pros
ecuted for mayhem.
It wasn’t long before the negroes
stampeded and began to scatter, and
in a few seconds the only negro left
at she polling place was the one who
had his ear clamped in Rush’s teeth.
Rush pulled the stalwart black
around like a terrier handling a rat;
then giving him a final shake he let
him go. He went off like a shot, and
then the whites started voting . .- .
and again old Edgefield ‘ 1 saved the
day. ’ ’
The first thing Rush did after the
polls closed was to send a doctor to
look for the negro with a hole in his
ear; and the first official act of the
new governor was to make Rush a
colonel on his staff —an empty honor,
maybe, but one still highly prized in
the South.

They landed on the Palaos for pur
pose of resting a bit, and to procure
fresh water.
Not far from the landing, and al
most surrounded by mangrove and
acacia trees, were several tents, and
in front of them sat a group of men
and women evidently of a mongrel
race.
“I asked for water in English,”
said the old tar, “but it seemed to
them an unknown tongue. But pres
ently there appeared .a gentleman who
