(FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY.
THE VIEWS OF SENATOR STONE
OF MISSOURI
And Senator Carmack of Tennessee.
Nominee for President Must Be a
Strict Party Man-Rejects the
Name of Grover Cleveland.
The Washington correspondent of the
Picayune in a special of recent date
says:
Senator William J. Stone of Missouri
has this to say about the Democratic
national platform for 1904:
"I can not anticipate the action of the
convention next year. This I will say,
however, that I discriminate between a
principle and a policy. Questions which
concern the organic form of our govern
ment, or which affect the personal lib
erty of the citizen, are questions of prin
ciple, while purely administrative ques
tions-such, for example, as relate to
the currency or taxation-are ordinary
questions of policy.
"I never did see a Democratic plat
form which did not, in my judgment,
contain some things that ought to have
been left out, and which did not leave
out some things that ought to have been
put in. Bu't I always take the platform
and stand upon it, because, as a whole,
I have always believed Democratic plat
forms to be right, and because they rep
resent the concensus of party opinion."
"I can not, or, at least, I prefer not,
to discuss these things or to make pro
phesies as to 'paramount issues for
1904," said Senator Stone.
"I shall favor a platform both pro
gressive and aggressive. I want the
Democratic party to get in the front of
things and lead. Conservatism is not
without its value. I believe'in being con
servative and prudent, but f want the
Democratic party to be more than a
mere restraining force. I want it to be
an affirmative, suggestive and directing
force. A position of mere negation does
not appeal to the progressive spirit of
the age. The world moves, and we must
move with it, if we would have a hand
in directing the current of events. Our
party must be distinctively a construe
tive f 4f'eeA ntEstt propose negotiations
to be done--great things that challenge
attention-things that promise good to
the country, and an increase of natural
power and prestige. We must command
the confidence of the great world of bus
iness and enterprise.
"This is a commercial age-too much
so, no doubt, but it is a fact. Growth,
progression is what the world is striving
after. We must keep in touch with the
spirit of the age, so that we may better
direct the course of events on lines as
nearly right as possible. This is no time
for a slow coach. What we shall put in
our platform, or leave out, what poli
cies we shall, as a conservative party,
attempt to develop, are things for think
ing men to think about. We must move
to the front."
"I do not care to discuss individ als.
No, I do not think Mr. Bryan will be
nominated, nor do I think he either ex
pects or desires the nomination. If any
effort is being made to eliminate him it
will fail, for he is still undoubtedly the
most commanding individual force in
the party. He can not be eliminated and
any effort in this direction will recoil on
those attempting it. The business - of
'eliminating' people from the party is not
the business I want Pemocrats to en
gage in. ,It would be more profitable to
get men into instead of getting them out
of the party.
"We have plenty of able men, who
would make safe, conservative presi
dents, and govern well, although they
might not indulge in-ouch erratic stren
uousities as would keep the country on
the tiptoe of some dread expectancy. On
this sfibject of men I make but one re
mark; and that is that the Democratic
candidate for president must be a Dem
ocrat who always supported his party
ticket; he must be a party man, who, if
elected, would give us a stalwart Demo
c'atic administration. That is the only
test of eligibility for the nomination I
would apply. It is not necessary that a
man slo ld have subscribed uncondi
tionally to every declaration of the Chi
cago and Kansas City platforms."
Seaator Carmak. of Tennessee de
clares for Judge Parker of New York.
He says that no anut will be nominated
for president In 4god who did not sup
port the ticket in 18g6 and xgoo.
"I don't think there is anything pro
scriptive about that," explained Mr. Car
snadk
"It is merely a matter of party policy,
an important one, and it has become
all the more important since some of the
people who have been prging the nomi
-a tt a man who left the party are
trying t bar the nomination
any ho ` Ist support the
THE READY AND THE HANDY
PISTOL
The sensational report of the raid on
crap shooters in a tent near the Kansas
City Southern yards recently was start
lirg. Two negroes, one Moss and one
Peterson. were shot in the onslaught by
the police, who claim they met with re
sistalnce and had to shoot in self-protec
tion. The statement of the police must
be accepted. but there are ir..tances on
record where similar raids have been
successful and not a~single man hurt.
The two negroes shot are well known
in Blanchard and Mooringsport and
throughout Ward Three of Caddo par
ish and have the endorsement of good
citizens. Indeed it may be said that it
was Mr. E. C. Hearne, who on meeting
Moss in Blanchard, the morning af er
the shooting, persuaded him to return'
to Shreveport and go to the Sanitarium
for treatment. Moss had reached Blan
chard during the night on a hand-car
propelled by some of his friends. In his
statement to Mr. Hearne, Moss said he
was shot while sitting on a cot. At any
rate he was shot, and for a while it was
believed fatally, but he is improving and
may recover.
The purpose of this article is to urge
caution on the police. Perhaps there are
men on the police force who may be too
ready with the handy pistol. A police
man is provided with a club to resist as
saults which may be made against him,
and his pistol is intended as a protection
to bis life if assaulted with a dangerous
weapon of any kind, and it is also to
check, if possible, a fleeing prisoner
against whom there may be a change of
felony, but the ready and handy pistol
should not be pulled or used in simple
arrests or in enforcing the ordinances of
the city. While thenegro at times is
noisy, yet, if not a desperado, he will
submit to arrest if he can; not escape,
and it may be cited that Deputy Sheriff
Worsham when a policeman has effected
the arrest of five or six negroes. and
marched every one to the lock-up. The
same may be said of Officer Bounds who
not long since arrested several negroes
and unaided marched them to the sta
tion. In fact there are other officers of
the police who have a like record, men
whoº - - tt'ir gun and would not]1
think of making a gun play except in the I
protection of their life or to secure a
prisoner charged with serious crime who
was about to escape. We again urge on
some policemen tIhe important necessity
of always being tool and self pos'essed
mnd to never pull out or use their g':
except it nust be, and then if it must
be, the law and public sent'inmevr wi'l
protect the officer.
NOTICE.
My friend, Mr. Dan E. Nicholson, the
present assessor, has informed me that
he will not be a candidate for re-election
to that office. I hereby, take this method
of notifying, the voters of Caddo parish
that I will be a candidate and will see
each individual at the proper time. I
deem an active canvass now for an elec
tion over a year off premature and un
wise.

The Ruston Progressive Age quer.
ies: "Has our levee system proven a
success ?" etc. The answer may be given
intelligently after the flood; but the ad
vocates of outlets are strengthened in
their opposition to an all levee system
by the several breaks in the levees and
by the reported cutting of the levee at
Hymela, forty miles above New Or
leans, which was suggested, as alleged,
to relieve other sections menaced iy
weak levees.
