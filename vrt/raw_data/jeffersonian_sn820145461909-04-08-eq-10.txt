Sketches from Roman History
The warfare that is being carried on
today against class legislation has
aroused a keen interest in this little
book, in which Mr. Watson deals with
the heroic land reformers of Rome,
the great slave revolt, the tribune of
the people, the brilliant leader of the
aristocrats, and other dramatic scenes
in the history of Rome.

Miss Bratton had noticed that Mi
nerva was not as buxom as she had
been two years before, but the negro’s
perpetual cheer and good temper had
apparently bespoken a never-ending
joy in life; the mistress was therefore
completely amazed by these revela
tions of the “White” family’s black
skeleton.
A few weeks later, Minerva came
to Miss Bratton with the request for
the loan of five dollars. It was wil
lingly given without question. For
several days Minerva was even more
than usually absent-minded, and the
work was hopelessly slipshod.
Then came one morning when she
did not arrive until after breakfast
was over, making her entrance with
peals of hysterical laughter, which
were in strange contrast with her cos
tume. She was garbed all in somber
black, with the exception of a star
tlingly green bow of ribbon at her
throat.
“Yas’m, you mus’ ’scuse muh be
in’ so late, kase dis am de las’ time
it eber gwine happen, fer you see I’se
a widder now, an’ a grass widder at
dat!” She grinned, touching the em
erald symbol at her neck.
“Set down, Miss Patsy, an’ we’ll
let de dishes sot a while, kase I wants
to talk to you a li’l’.”
Miss Bratton was immune to all
surprise now, so she obediently seated
herself and listened.
