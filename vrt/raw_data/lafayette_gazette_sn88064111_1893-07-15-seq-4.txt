Flower"
"For two years I suffered terribly
with stomach trouble, and was for
all that time under treatment by a
physician. He finally, after trying
everything, said my stomach was
worn out, and that I would have to
cease eating solid food. On the rec
ommendation of a friend I procured
a bottle of August Flower. Itseem
ed to do me good at once. I gained
strength and flesh rapidly. I feel
now like a new man, and consider
fthat August Flower -has cured me."

the w6o. rld.; The National Editorial as
sociation has had its :anmeal meeting in
our city, and the leading women think

branobes of reform work have been
hokling their congresses here in the
new art institute. among these peo
ple were a large percentage of the
country publishers of the United States,
as well a manyiof the heads of metro
politan and hostsof the world's
representad women.
The meeting of the editors was one
of the timost memoriable they have ever
held, and the congresses of the women

an prst concerned herself in the atairs
of nations;-but there was an added sig
nificance in these meetings in the fact
that they were held in the World's
Fair city during the greatest celebra
tion the world has ever known.
Between the meetings of the editors
and the sessions of the waens con
gress there were frequent excursions to
the grandcentral point of world-wide
interest-Jackson park-h-pgblic and
private receptions, theaitsi parties, etc.,
and the visiting celebrities were treated
almost as gnests of the city. It is not
at all likely that any of them will ever
forget theocession, for everything went
off successfully and the sights 're
sented at the world's fair so far charmed
and entranced these people of mental
superiority that their enthusiasm and
praise knew no bounds. They will all
take hack to their homes with them im
pressions that will in all probability re
sult in much good to the exposition.
The scribes can write intelligently and

accurately of what their eyes have seen
and their ears heard,.anrl those who de
pend on them for their everyday In
formation will be mre fully and re
liably inforaned than they could other
wise have been.
The fair officials have done all in their
power to render the visits of the nota
bles enjoyable. according thei. every
possible privilege and in every conceiva
ble way ministering to theire6mfort
and convenience. It is safe to predict
that in all the world's fair season there
will not be an event which will add
more to the history of the exposition
than will the meeting of the newspaper
people.
Saturday is at present the great day
at the fair. The half-holiday granted
by many of the business houses of the
city on that day to give their employes
a chance to visit the "White City"
swells the number of aldmissionrs to
more than double that of any other
day of the week. There is also a much
greater incentive to visit the fair on
Saturday, and especially in the evening,
in the superior attractions which are
offered in the form of fine musical con
certs and brilliantilluminations. There
are several bands constantly employed
at the grounds, and they perform every
day, but on Saturday, in view of the in
creased attendance, the directors exert
themselves to furnish something extra
good. The illuminations in the evening
defy description. They must be seen
'to be properly understood and appre
-iated.
The average daily attendance for the
first three weeks of the exposition has
been in the neighborhood of thirty
thousand, Saturdays excepted. The
regular Saturday crowd is about three
times that number. At that rate, of
course, there is no money being made,
as the regular daily expenses of the
fair greatly exceed the amount re
reived from the sale of tickets, but the
attendance is on the increase, and when
the summer season is fairly on it will
be twice or three times as large as at
present, and in the fall season the rich
will come. One reason why there is rush
a small attendance just now is that the
knowledge of the incompleteness of the
exhibits has been so widely published
that it is keeping a great many out
piders from coming until later on.
Much has been said and written
about the sights to be seen in the Mid
way Plaisance, but hardly a day passes
without ushering in some new attrac
tion to the myriad curiosities assem
bled there. It is at present the most
wonderful thoroughfqre on the globe,
beyond doubt, and it is safe to say that
anyone who has once visited the plack
will declare it to be worth the price of
admission ivithout going any further
into the great fair. Some very ludicrous
things occur in the Plaisance, and near
ly everybody who passes through it is
kept on the broad grin from one end to
the other. The Turk with his vol
unmentionables goes stalking

that he prawled ithto an outof-the-way
corner, where he remained, like a 'coon
ip a hollow tree, until some kind friend
brought him another outfit of fez and
baggy trousers. .In these he speedily
clad himself ani stored away his Clark
street regiaientals as curiosities.
In a half hour's walk through the
Plaisance one may hear nearly all the
languages spoken. in the world, and
among them some that are rarely' ever
spoken in this country. Then there is
the mingling of the many strange
costumes. The dark-skinned citizen of
Cairo with his white turban and sky
blue gown jostles the still darker
skinned gentleman from Java with his
calico pants and nondescript headgear,
and so on. And they all seem to be as
neighborly as though they had dwelt
next door to each other for years in
stead of a few days. It is indeed a
strange thing that has come to pass
here in our city, the name of which but
a few years ago was unknown among
the nations which now find harbor
with us.

"Visitors to the exposition not know

aIaus i .he Columbian exposition,
strong as't has been from the first,
seeks. wrher to increase. Not only
bavr.e .mperor and empress and the
heir to the throne expressed themselves
to me sia greatly interested, but in all
classes of BaRussian society with which-I
have to do the same feeling is very
clear. -
"There I. evidently a feeling that the
twonationas are under somewhat sim
ilar economic conditions, each being
vast .-JIn extent, with enormous unde
velopedrespources, and, that our country
having taken the lead in all that per
tains to_ material development, to say
nothing of leadership in other fields,
both the exposition and the country at
large are the most fitting places for the
study of the leading facts. The result
of this feeling is that a considerable
number of Russians are making ready
to visit Chicago, and, what is still more
to the purpose, the government is send
ing a large number of its foremost ex
perts in various departments for the
study of the exhihts ebits icagu, and
for examination into the rious insti
tutions throughout the-inite itates.
A recent publication gives tie names
of so such special delegates,
amoifg.ti Jrominent professors in
the universities and leading officials in
the ministeries. Several of these are
also representatives of people in the
highest political and social positions.
Typical of these are such as the young
Prince Sergius Wolkonsky, who belongs
to one of the most distinguished fam
ilies in 'he empire,-apd who has already
distinguished himself as an offieial and
writer; and Princess Schahooskoy,
who, distinguished by the development
of establishments for woman's work on
her estates, is sent especially to take
charge of the Russian gibit of such
work at Chicago. She, , belongs to
one of the most noted families in -the
empire, and is one of the empress'
maids of honor."
GUIDES AS INTERPRETERS.
A Corps of ien at Jackson Pa kIt Who
Can Talk lihalf a Dozen Languages.
Guides that can talk half a dozen
languages-such is the latest acquisi
tion to Capt. Rice's staff on the world's
fair grounds. While the corps is not
gotten up strictly as an interpreters'
corps, it is practicplly such.
Company No. 25 is the one th4se lin
guists belong to, and it is under the
command of Capt. Foote. It is drilled
in the same manner as the Columbian
guard, but it does not draw the same
salary. Each man's remuneration is
thirty dollars per month.
The company will, when completed,
consist of two hundred and fifty men.
At,.ptcsent.it contains .about eighty,
uint is in the formative process as yet.
The personnel is to be one of great ir
telligence. Most of the men are from
colleges and universities of the coun
rty, but many are from foreign coun
t.es and speak readily five or six lan
guages. Most of the men speak more
than one language, ani those that
speak English, German and French, the
langiiakes with - which one- can- et
along anywhere on the globe almost
are numerous.
This corps of guides must not be con
founded with the roller-chair men.
The latter are under the control of con
'cessionaires, while the guides are under
the control of the exposition manage
ment through Capt. Rice, commandant
of the Columbian guard. They will be
stationed at different buildings in the
grounds, and from there they will be
ready to do service for such as need
them. The price is to be fifty cents an
hour for parties of five or less, so that
a party may have the services of an in
telligent guide, speaking their tongue.
at ten cents apiece, in case there be five
in the party.
The corps is to be uniformed differ
ently from the Columbian guard. The
uniform is to be of cadet gray, and will
be trimmed with black braid. The cap
is to be of blue, and the buttons are of
a kind known technically as "blind"
buttons. The men are not uniformed
as yet, and every morning as they drill
on -the- administration court visitors
wonder what body of soldiers they are.
CORN PALACE DECORATIONS.
Soine of the Unique Designs to Be seen in
--the Woman's Building.
The corn palace decorations presented
to the WVoman's building by the ladies of
Sioux City are in place,and the pavilion
is one of the most beautiful in the
building. It is open, a frieze extending
downward some three feet. On
the outside of this are medallion heads
of the goddesses of Grecian mythology,
each framed inmiUet seed. The back
ground is of pearl hominy, while the
heads are of differently shaded kernels
of corn, the hair being of the silk.
The inner frieze is also mythological,
the four panels representing fourscenes
in the legend of the planting of the
corn. The first panel depicts the send
ing forth of "Triptolemus, the seed
planter," the second "Eumolpus and
the Olympian Gods," the third the
giving into Hlades of Persephone, the
planting of the corn; the fourth, the
