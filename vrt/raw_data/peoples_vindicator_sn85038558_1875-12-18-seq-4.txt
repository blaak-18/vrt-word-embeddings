WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion ?American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters sntoessfully up
on the sixth year of its existenuce, and
bas become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, tlien, to satisfyt the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it dies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
nuasterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the, ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
denmand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jumpl, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fias
tidious.

Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg.
stable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevadd moun.
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the ynpar
alleled success of VI~ EGAR BIT

remove the cause- of disease, and
Lhe patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno.
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos.
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vix.
oGar Brrrss in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.

Companied by extensive derange

treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari

There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WALxan's VsINEGAR
