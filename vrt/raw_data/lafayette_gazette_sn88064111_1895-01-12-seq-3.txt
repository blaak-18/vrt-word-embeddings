The troop of Indian musicians
,nd.r the manmagment of Courtney
XIM. Young, played at Filk's Opera
H-louse last Sunday night and dis
coursedl the sweetest music heard
in this town for some time. 'Ihe
I audience was small, but everybody
in the house seemed to be delighted
with the entertainment. Tne man
ager, Mr. Young, is a most affable
gentleman and those who had the
p:easure of an acquaintance with
him were impressed with the uniform
courtesy with which he treats every
one.
Mr. Kalckitein Discharged.
Judge McFadden tried a number
of cases during the past week. The
most important trial and the one
which attracted the largest crowd
of spectators was the' preliminary
examination of Mlr. Ad von Kalck
stein. Owing the prominence of
the parties involved the case may
well be tefmed the cause celebrc of
the week. It wi!l be remembered
that an affidavit was made against
Mlr. Kalckstein by Mr Franklin
Steiner for the larceny of a calf.
T'he case was fixed for the 7th of
January and the witnesses were no
tified to appear before the justice's
court on that day. A number of
witnesses were examined and after
listening to the evidence offered
by both sides Judge cIcFadden ex
onerated Mr. Kalckstein of all cul
Irability in the matter and discharg
ed him. Judge O.C. Mouton ap
peared as counsel for the defendant.
Immediately aftbt the decisibn was
rendered by the court Mr. Kalck
stein swore out an trfidavit against
Mr. Franklin Steiner for criminal
libel, and The Gazette is inform
ed that a suit for damages will be
instituted.'
Two Pooular Gentlemen.
Messrs. Horace and .Hermin Mac
Clure, cf Gibson City, Illinois,
iree passengers on the West-bound
train'Thursday being on their way
to Lake Artliur where they went to
attend to ' some business. Both
these gentlemen are very popular in
Lafayette and during the twenty
minutes that the train stopped at
the depot they shook hands with a
large number of their friends. Mr.
Horace McCli're and other mem
bers of the same family were at one
time identified with se -tc-l business
enterprises in this town and it is to
be regretted that they did not re
main longer in our midst. It is
such menn as the MIcClures that
we need in Lafayette and when we
are fortunate enough to have them
locate among us, we should extend
to them every inducement rather
than pursue a selfish and narrow
minded policy whose baneful ef
fects are exceedingly injurious to
the growth of a town.

'Tlhe Ferris Failure.
The failure of the Ferris Sugar:
Manuftcturing Conpanv has caused
consicderable annoyance if not de
cided less to a large number of our
cane growers, many of whom had
contracted to sell their cane to this;
company. \Ve are informed that
nearly all the parties who have
shipped their cane to the Icrris
Company have already been paid
with the exception of perhlaps S4oo
or $S5o=. Fortunately the manageyri
of the Caffery refinery at Franklini
has con.ented to buy the balance
of the eiop in this parish, and last
WedneSdayy contracted to take the;
remaining crop of Alf. libhert, C.
A. and Jno. O. Mouton, P. Cail
louet, J. A. Chargois, J. P. Revillon,_
I,. Aims and several others who
went to Franklin for the purpose of.
making contracts. Not less than
S2000 tons are yet to be shipped from
this section. WVe unlderstand that
some of our pl'nters have perfected
arrangoittents to sell their cane to
the Calcisieu refinery.

Found at Last.
While in this town Tuesday last
Mr. Fernanrd -roussard was treated
to a genuine surprise. About a
year ago he stood as bondsmani for
a negro, Wmni. Smith, who is charg
ed in St Landlry parish with obtain
ing money under false pretence. In
the meantime Stmith jumped his
bond and fled to parts un
knowr. Fortunaiely for Mr. Brous
sard the case has not yet been cdll
ed up and in this way the bond was
not forfeited. Mr. tlroussard
searched far and wide for Smith,
but he toulcl not be found. I-Ie had
about lost all hope of ever finding
hiti and had made up his mind to I
settle with the State whenever the
case would lbe called, but last Thurs
day while walking along one of our
streets he was'surprised to meet the
ruuch wanted negro. Smith bowed
to Mr. Broussard and acknowledged
"the corri" and was placed under air
rest. He will be sent to Opelousas
to stand trial-and Mir. Broussard
will be spared the necessity of pay
ng Syoa for S.nith's daplicitv.

If The Gazette had a prize-belt
it would be presented to (C us LJacoste,
.IJe-n Guillotte and Valerien Do
Iningue who have easily earned
the title of ''champion hunters" of
this parish. In a three day's hunli
near Lake Arthur they killed and
bagged 200 French ducks and 500

Lafayette Friday morning.
Adding Insult to Injury.
The following letter has been re
ceived by a number of cane grow
ers in this section who had contract
ed to ship their cane to Barbreck be
fore the failure of the Ferris Comi
tany. it will be seen from this let
ter that the receiver proposes to pay
the planters Sr per ton for their
cane. W\e dont know what is the
object of t,,e rececver in offering to
buy cane at S r per tou, for it can
not be with the hope of buying some
at thi;s price? Surely not. Experi
once shows that it costs the planters
about 85 cents per ton to cut, haul
and load his cane, and adding 5`
cents for freight, the expense per
ton, without counting cultivation.
amounts to St.35. Therefore, it
is ciearly evident that the planter
who sells hib, cane at $L per ton de
livered at Barbreck, ,'foes so through
a sense of philanthropy felt for Mr.
Ferris in his misfortune, or else he
is a fit subject for a lunatic asylum.
