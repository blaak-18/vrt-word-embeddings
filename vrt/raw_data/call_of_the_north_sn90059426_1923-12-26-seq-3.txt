Is America to become * land of
imbeciles? Is this Republic to be
populated with degenerates, with
dope-heads, with men and women who
must have stimulants in order to
live? If so, it would be merciful if
the God who made us would sound
the trump of judgment and wind the
whole business up immediately. And
yet, if some of our doctors and drug
stores continue to do business, we
are bound for the fock-strewn shores
of wreckage without fail.
Recently, Dr. James T. Fisher, one
of the best known physicians in
Southern California, has been arrest
ed, caught with the marked money,
as a dope trafficker furnishing whole
sale quantities to the movie addicts,
of whom there are literally thousands,
and also keeping the high society ele
ment of Los Angeles well supplied.
Narcof • Agent DeSpain, who made
the arrest, declares that this physic
ian has been dealing in unbelievable
quantities of dope and that among his
customers are some of the .most
prominent business and professional
people of Los Angeles and Hollywood.
Outside of the fact, that perhaps
no physician in Southern California
stood higher than Dr. Fisher in his
profession, this arre t is not at all
surprising. For on all sides today
you hear the accusation that numer
ous doctors and more numerous drug
stores are engaged in making dope
fiends and drunkards out of their
customers. This is a disgrace. That
the very agencies to which we have
looked for health, have become the
sources of poison for body, mind and
soul is indeed a shame!
COLO.
A Federal Agent recently stated to
this Editor that there were at least
100 drug stores in Los Angeles
through which booze and dope could
be purchased by any addict, trusted
not to divulge their source of supply
or betray the druggist into the hands
of the law. I could not believe such
a statement at first. But upon in
quiry among those whose business it
is to know the facts as to conditions,
I find that this officer put the matter
mildly. To say hat there are as few
as 100 such drug stores is to put the
tragic truth modestly indeed.
Recently Judge Bledsoe permitted
numerous criminals accused of the
sale of liquor and dope to plead guil
ty and accept fines, with the promise
that no jail sentences would be im-
THE ROMAN ATTITUD
The purring and fawning of Ca
tholics around the Jews for some
time past, in order to get the Jews
to “pay the freight” in their so-call
ed work of “exterminating the Ku
Klux Klan” is a well-known fact.
The Catholics know that the pre
sent fight of the Klan is not direct
ed against the Jews, but against
Rome herself, to prevent her from de
stroying our free institutions, the
public school system, free speech',
free press and free assembly.
Running true to form, Rome pre
fers to spend other people’s money in
stead of her own. Her hand is ever
alive to receive, but dead to release.
Always taking in, but never giving
out; the mortmain of an immortal
beggar.
The strangest part of this matter
is that the Jews have apparently
allowed themselves to be drawn into
the web of the Roman spider, who so
cunningly invited them into her par
lor. Have they forgotten how, in the
past Rome has persecuted them,
whenever it suited her to do so, and
will again and again, when in power?
If so, the following occurrence, now
taking place, should refresh their
memories, and be a warning to them.
Again can they see Romanism in ac
tion.
The human organism that has
grown out of this preposterous fic
tion is substantial and dangerous
enough. Rome boasts that she never
changes. Beware of the Trojan
THE SPIRIT IS WILLING
BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK
While the Cross holds out to burn,
the erring Klansman may return.
Remember this always, Klansmen.
In America’s greatest order, with its
vast membership, despite the acid
tests, there will be found, from time
to time, an erring brother. Support
him in the right way, rescue him,
without condoning his weakness, and
with this fair start he will toddle
along again in his upward climb in
the light of the Fiery Cross.
Every church and every fraternity
has numerous backsliders and luke
warm mmebers, and evangelists are
needed occasionally to galvanize them
into life.
Any deliberate violation of the sa
cred Klan oath is unpardonable, of
course, meriting condign punishment,
but minor offenses, due to human
frailty. May he expected right along.

posed. This effort to clear the court
docket was tremendously successful.
A multitude of guilty scoundrels
trampled on each other’s heels in an
effort to make their plea and pay
their fine. Over $80,000.00 in fineft
were collected within three days.
Every kind of man from an Italian
bootlegger to a Jewish Rabbi, who
wept as he counted out his cash, paid
in fines for dealing either in liquor
or dope. And the astonishing thing
to note was the great number of Los
Angeles druggists who were present,
eager to keep out of jail so they
could continue their remunerative
business,
The hour has undoubtedly come for
the medical fraternity to get busy.
They ought to take enough time off
in their battle against the Chiroprac
tors, Osteopaths and others to tend to
these Doctors and Druggists who are
becoming a more menacing foe to
health, as well as to character, than
any half dozen diseases of this gen
eration. Let our honest Physicians,
and there are thousands of them,
make relentless war upon these para
sites who prey upon the weakness of
men. They are unworthy to be as
sociated with any profession. They
are human scavengers of the most
nauseating variety. They belong to
the vulture class of human beings.
Brand them! Drive them forth! Ex
pose them! And the real Doctors of
this country are the men to do it.
Most dope fiends are not made ac
cidently. Ninety per cent of them are
manufactured by the dope sellers.
This is true to a lesser degree of the
users of intoxicants. These scamps
who are thus manufacturing a multi
tude of inebriates and imbeciles over
America ought to have the branding
iron of public indignation as no other
class of criminals. And the major
ity of them are either supposed to
be practicing medicine or selling med
icine. Thus they hide behind the
blind of a decent and beneficial pro
fession, while they ply their nefarious
business of wrecking and ruining hu
man beings. And the day is high
noon for the medical brotherhood to
resort to every honorable extreme to
drive from the profession and from
all relation to the practice of medi
cine these human buzzards and the
contemptible criminals.

TOWARD THE JEWS
horse!
Munich, Bavaria, Oct. 29.—Two
hundred Jewish families have been
expelled from Bavaria, and as many
more are awaiting deportation. The
expulsions were made by order of
Dr. Von Kahr, the’Dictator, and were
made on the ground of inability to es
tablish the right of domicile.
Among those expelled were many
old residents who, while not subpects
of the Barvarian State, are citizens
of the Reich. Many of them saw ser
vice during the war in Barvarian
regiments. A number of East Euro
pean Jews from Austria were among
the expelled.
The houses owned by those deport
ed have been requisitioned for the al
leged purpose of housing refugees
from the Ruhr. The Bavarian Jewry
is in a panic. Many heads of families
have offered to leave Bavarian terri
tory voluntarily, if they are permit
ted to change their residence to other
German provinces.
The Voelkische Beobachter, organ
of Adolph Hittler, leader of the Ba*
varian Fastciscti, continues to pub
lish the names of Jews not yet ex
pelled, and demands the confiscation
of their property, as well as that of
Jews already expelled.
Vienna, Oct 29.—Thus far 300
Jews have arrived here from Munich,
where they were expelled. A majority
of them have been left without means,
all of their property having been
confiscated.—Dawn.
THE FRIENDS WE NEVER SEE
Around the corner I have a friend,
In the great city that has no end.
Let days go by and week? rush on,
And before I know it a year is gone;
And I never see my friend’s face,
For life is a swift and terrible race.
He knows I like him just as well
As in the days when I rang his bell
And he rang mine. We were younger
then,
And now we are busy, tired men—
Tired with playing a foolish game,
Tired with trying to make a name.
“Tomorrow, 1 ” I say, “I will call on Jim
Just to show him I’m thinking of
him.”
But tomorrow comes and tomorrow
goes,
And the distance between us grows
and grows.
Around the corner—yet miles away
“Here’s a telegram, sir.” “Jim died
today!”
And that’s what we get and deserve
in the end—
“ Around the corner a vanished
friend.”

May He, who sitteth in that
Sublime universe of everlasting
Joy, look down upon our weakness,

As His children, in life as in death.

The CALL OF THE NORTH
BIBLES, BI6OTS AND
(Reasons for this demand explained
—Catholic Bulletin editorial analyz
ed)
BY A. L. S.
The Catholic Bulletin, published at
Cleveland, Ohio, in an editorial com
ment on the speech of the Imperial
Wizard, H. W. Evans, of the Ku Klux
Klan, made at Dallas, Texas, has
among other things, the following to
say:
“The Imperial Wizard could hard
ly, of course, finish his speech with
out at least one dig at the parochial
school. Every bigot is allowed that
much. Evans knows as well as any
one that Catholics have ever stressed
the importance of religion •in educa
tion. Non-Catholics are coming to
realize this need also, now that
visions of a lopsided generation are
coming up before them, men and wo
men with big heads, clever and capa
ble, but with small hearts and no mor
als. Catholics have established their
parochial schools, have supported
them out of their own pockets and
have sent their children to them
merely because they believe that re
ligion is necessaify in education.
Better citizens are the result of this
system. This hardly means that the
parochial school is an example of di
vided Americanism.”
Editorial Is Analyzed
A little analysis of this editorial
ought to be of interest to our readers.
We have here a .declaration that
“Catholics have ever stressed the im
portance of religion in education.”
Again the statement is made that
“they believe that religion is neces
sary in education.”
SCHOOLS AND ROADS
INTERDEPENDENT
—K-K-K
History Shows Amazing Parallel Be-
tween Road Conditions and De
gree of Education
—K-K-K
Too often the relationship between
good roads and schools is considered
to begin and end with the use of ve
hicles to bring students to and from
their institutions of learning. As a
matter of fact, the relationship is
much deeper, of greater significance.
For it is the universal history of
all mankind that where transporta
tion is ready and easy, civilization
follows; that where transportation is
difficult and scarce, is barbarism and
lawlessness. And where is civiliza
tion is the demand for education;
where is barbarism is satisfaction
with ignorance.
Bad Roads—llliteracy
The illiterate sections of the Unit
ed Statese are so, not only because of
lack of schools and lack of means
to transoort children to and from
schools, but because of lack of pop
ular demand for schools and for edu
cation. The good road not only
brings the possibility of the school,
and the means of getting children to
and from the school, it also brings
the better farm, the traveler, the
ecturer, the library, the electric
light, the telephone, the community
organization, all of which tend to
create a demand for information,
for wisdom, for “book lamin’,” for
education.
The nation, at present engaged in
giving millions and millions of dol
lars to the states to match their
funds in federal aid road building, is
not only supplying transportation
which will aid and help the schools,
but is building up where it as yet
exists but sparsely, a civilization
which will in turn create such a de
mand for schools and teachers and
books, as will speedily, in those re
gions, turn back the tide of illiteracy.
Roads will help draw the United
States where she belongs, towards
the top of the column of nations,
listed on # a basis of illiteracy, in
stead of as at present, away down
in the list.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
,It is difficult to «*y how much may
have been meant to be implied in
these statements, for, if judged by
the actual actions and attitude of the
Catholic church, it appears that that
church is favorable only to the teach
ing of the Catholic reKgion in connec
tion with education. It is recalled
by the ptlblic generally that the Ca
tholic church is the antagonist to the
introduction of the Bible into the
public schools, and the Bible is the
greatest book —the fundamental book
—of the Christian religion.
The Ku Klux Klan believes in the
teaching of the fundamentals of re
ligion in the public schools, and to
this end demands the introduction of
the Bible into every public school in
the United States of America. The
Klan does not believe in the teaching
of creeds in the public schools, how
ever.
Protestant peoples are essentially a
moral people. Their religion is of a
practical sort. Protestant peoples
everywhere believe and teach ethical
practices between man and man, and
direct communion between the in
dividual man and his God. Further
more, they believe that all the right
and sound ethical principles are
found stated and illustrated in the
Bible.
Protestants believe that right, jus
tice and mercy practiced between and
among the individual units of a na
tion will result in the lessening of
evil to just that extent as men and
women will practice right ethical
principles as laid down in the Holy
Bible.
FREE SPEECH DRIVE IS
LAUDED
Court Right to Punish for Contempt
Washington.—Courts have no right
to invoke the charge of contempt to
stifle criticism of their actions, Sen
ator W. E. Borah (Rep., Idaho) de
clared today, in a statement which
was the opening gun in “free speech”
campaign to be waged in the senate
this winter. Borah cited the case of
Controller Craig of New York, sen
tenced to 60 days for criticizing a
judge, and the language of Federal
Judge Killitts in sentencing Dr. Cook
recently as examples that “it is time
the people exercise the right to crit
icize the court.”
“The power of the court to punish
for contempt is an indispensable pow
er, bht it is a power that is mostly
liable to great abuse,” said Borah. “It
ought never to be used except under
absolute necessity to protect the
court.
“There was an instance in Tennes
see some months ago, and there is the
Craig case. It is being used to pre
vent just and proper criticism of the
actions of the decisions of the court.
“When I read the language which
came from the federal judge a few
days ago pronouncing sentence, I
concluded the time had come when
people should exercise the right to
criticize the court. It does not make
any difference how guilty the man is,
who is in the dock, such language as
used on this occasion should never
come from a court.
‘I felt for a long time that parties
charged with contempt for acts out
side of and beyond the court ought to
have a jury trial. I would not apply
that rule to acts or statements in the
presence of the court or having to do
with he immediae processes of court.
“Some measure must be devised to
restrain the abuse of this power.
There is plenty of room in this coun
try for free speech, free press, and
fair and reasonable criticism and al
so for an independent judiciary.”—

COOUDSE TALKS TO THE PEOPLE
BY GILBERT O. NATIONS, PH. D.
(Missouri Valley Independent)
Washington, D. C. —Special Cor
respondence to The Independent.—
For more than three months this na
tion and the world have awaited with
deep interest the message of Presi
dent Coolidge to congress. Politic
ians at the national capital have
looked forward to it as the keynote
of his candidacy for election to the
presidency next year.
Those who expected a conspicious
ly great message are somewhat dis
appointed. Yet it has the merit of
tact, conservatism and political ex
pediency.
The president is against the Town
er-Sterling School Bill. Though not
referring specifically to that measure
or to its successor in the present con
gress, he declares himself against fi
nancial aid by the federal government
to public education in the states.
His attitude toward the creation of
a department of education in the cab
inet is not very clear. But he dis
cusses public welfare and education
jointly in a manner indicating that he
favors the policy urged by the hier
archy of Rome during the last five
years for a department of public wel
fare with education embodied in that
department.
The message favors restriction of
foreign immigration. Rumor at the
National Capital is that the president
approves in the bill introduced by
Representative Johnson, and known
as the “Selective Immigration Act of
1924.”
The president favors our entry into
the World Court of the League of Na
tions without entering the league it
self. He is opposed to the soldiers’
bonus and in favor of tax reduction.
attitude had already been fore
cast by the public utterances of the
secretary of the treasury several days
previous.
Gillette Re-elected Speaker
Deadlocked two days, the republi
can majority finally re-elected Speak
er Gillett by compromise with the in
surgent group December 5. A few
years ago the clear majority of fifteen
republicans in the house of represent
atives world have been ample to or
ganize and control that body. But
conditions have changed.
The aroused conscience and patriot
ism of the nation is reflected in con
gress. Seventeen members of the
bouse, including the whole republic
an delegations from Minnesota and
Wisconsin, and Representatives Sin
clair, of North Dakota, and LeGuard
ia, of New York, refused to vote for
Gillett until assured by stipulations
in writing that the house rules would
be liberalized in the following par
ticulars:
1. That the rules of the sixty
seventh congress shall be adopted for
thirty days only.
2. That during that period any
member may offer amendments to the
rules, which shall be referred to the
rules committee and proptly report
ed back for action in the house.
3. That such rules with any
amendments proposed by the commit
tee shall be subject to reasonable dis
cussion, amendment and record vote
in the house.
4. After the committee has report
ed any member may freely offer
amendments to any rule of the house
and call for a record vote thereon.
5. One motion to recommit shall
be in order.
IMPORTANCE OF HIGH
SCHOOLS TO BOYS
Impressive facts and figures from
government statistics showing the
money and cultural value of educa
tion are available. Here is a com
parison of the average earnings of
high school graduates with the un
educated man, as given by the gov
ernment statistics:
A high school graduate earns on the
high school graduate earns on the
average SI,OOO yearly for 40 years,
(ages 18 to 58) equals $40,000
A poorly educated man earns on
the average SSOO yearly for 44
years (ages 14 to 58) equals . .$22,000
Increased earnings of high school
graduates on account of four years
(720 school days) of additional
schoolin g—s4o,ooo less $22,000
equals SIB,OOO
Therefore, each additional day
spent in school adds to the life earn
ings of a high school graduate $lB,-
000 divided by 720 equals $25.
Every day the first boy spent in
high school was worth $25 to him in
after years, for it added that amount
t%his life’s earnings.

There’s no slipping up hill again,

That the rules of procedure in con
gress are in many respects antiquat
ed, arbitrary and unjust is well
known. The insurgents, holding the
balance of power between the demo
cratic and republican parties, threat
ened to co-operate with the demo
crats in organizing the house unless
republican leaders would yield to their
demand for overhauling the rules.
The records of a number of the in
surgents are not creditable. Some of
them voted against the present law
to restrict immigration and against
the Burnett law and their votes have
been wrong on other important meas
ures. But there os a merit in their
demand, which was finally conceded
by the republican majority, that the
rules of the house of representatives
be revised and liberalized.
Congress Deluged With Bills
Some three thousand bills and reso-
lutions were introduced in the house
of representatives immediately after
that body organized. More than half
of them are private measures grant
ing pensions or increase of pensions
or other favors to individuals. Sever
al hundreds should be classified as
political “pork.” They appropriate
public funds for the purchase of land
and erection of buildings in cities
and towns of the congressional dis
tricts represented by the respective
members who introduced the bills.
Vast sums are thus disbursed at
every session to enhance the popular
ity and political strength of senators
and representatives in their states
and districts. Some are designed to
tap the United States treasury in be
half of other questionable interests.
Plans to donate land and other endow
ments to divers and sundry private
and denominational institutions are
embodied in a number of the meas
ures.
Thousands of additional measures
will be introduced within the next few
days. As soon as it is possible for
the clerical force to classify the vast
accumulation and render them acces
sible, those of real importance will be
outlined and their legislative treat
ment narrated in these dispatches.
Selective Immigration Act of 1924
Numerous bills in relation to im
migration have been introduced. Some
cf them would repeal the existing im
migration law and throw open the
floodgates to admit all comers. Others
would remove the literacy test that
has been steadfastly opposed by the
Roman hierarchy during the last 30
years. But the one of outstanding in
terest is that introduced by Chairman
Albert Johnson of the house immigra
tion committee. It is known as the
“Selective Immigration Act of 1924.”
By its terms it is to take effect July
Ist, 1924.
The chief merit of this measure is
that it makes some provisions for
sifting immigration at its source and
it reduces the quota admissable from
each foreign country from three to
two per cent of the nationals of such
country already here. What is more
important still is that it makes the
census of 1890 instead of 1910 the*
basis on which to calculate the quotas.
It thus avoids making the vast unde
sirable hordes of aliens that came
from debased lands in Southern and
Eastern Europe between the dates
mentioned an element in the basis of
calculation.

now’s the time to slip it to him,
For he cannot read his tombstone
when he’s dead.
More than fame and more than money
is the common kind and sunny,
And the hearty, warm approval of a
friend,
For it gives to life a savor, and it
makes you stronger, braver,
And it gives you heart and spirit to
the end.
If he earns your praise—bestow it; if
you like him, let him know it,
Let the words of true encouragement
be said;
Do not wait till life is over and he’s
underneath the clover,
For he cannot read his tombstone
when he’s dead.—Play Fair.
—Selected.
This is the gospel of labor,
Ring it, ye bells of the kirk,
The Lord of Love came down from
above,
To live with the men who work.
This is the rose He planted,
Here in the thorn-cursed soil;
Heaven is blessed with perfect rest,
But the blessing of earth is toil.
One who claims that he knows
about it
Tells me the earth is a vale of sin;
But I and the bees, and the birds,
we doubt it,
And think it a world worth living in.
