of this policy, and in his inaugural
address strongly urged the party
platform as a/guide in all matters of
pending legislation, yet these were
swept aside, and a legislature almost
unanimously chosen as Democratic
enacted prohibition by the largest
majority ever given by any body of
state law-makers for such a measure I
Great indeed is the power of public
sentiment when it could thus influ
ence a Democratic legislature to en
act so important a law in direct con
flict with the party platform. The
Constitution concludes its remark
ably candid editorial as follows:
“And the people of the state have
thrown political creed and party or
ganization to the winds and written
Gate’ before the one-time Georgia
Democracy.
“There are certain things the peo
ple want and mean to have. They
have begun to have them in the
states; they have begun to have them
in the nation. In the accomplish
ment of these objects, party creed and
party organization will be abandoned
the moment they get in the way.
“Under whatever banner the peo
ple may align themselves they will
ultimately demonstrate, as they have
begun to do, that regardless of the
views of leaders, regardless of party
lines and platforms and creeds, their
voice and will are, at last, supreme.”

There is probably no one form of
pastime or enjoyment that can con
tribute more real enjoyment to the
home life than music in vocal or in
strumental form. It is true that in
neither line may musical education be
developed so one would become ex
pert or care to appear in public, but
if the members of the family who
possess any ear for music will do the
best they can very satisfactory re
sults can be secured. There is a .
wealth of instrumental music as well
as numerous old and much loved
hymns and popular melodies, the sing
ing of which will add materially to
the harmony and happiness of the
family life.

STANLEY BOYKIN.
Denver, Colo., Nov. 21, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson:
Your editorial, “An Appeal to the
President,” sounds like a bugle call.
The government alone should give us
more money and it should be a full
legal tender paper. I think, how
ever, that you place the amount of
the issue far too low. Eight hundred
millions would be only a drop in the
bucket. We should have ten billions
at least added to our present volume.
The banks hold more than 12 billions
of “deposits” with perhaps less than
one-half billion of currency availa
ble to satisfy the demands of their
depositors.
In this one item alone we see the
need for more than five times the
of money now in the nation. And the
banks to be able to meet the concert
ed demand. of all their depositors
WATSON’S WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
would need 26 times the amount now
in their possession.
We, as a nation, should have
enough money so that the accumulat
ed wealth could be represented by
real money, and besides this vast
volume in which we conserve our
wealth, we should have still an addi
tional volume of money for exchange
purposes.
To show what an enormous volume
can be absorbed by a nation I want
to cite the case of New Zealand. The
government there loaned 25 millions
to the farmers at a low rate of in
terest. This money was obtained
from outside the nation and was
therefore a clear addition to the vol
ume they then had. It did not undu
ly affect prices but produced the
greatest prosperity in the island. If
the United States would give to its
people the same ratio of increase per
capita it would add 6 billions to our
volume, and we could no doubt util
ize that amount far more readily
than the New Zealanders did the 25
millions provided by their govern
ment.
I am convinced that our own money
shortage is far greater than ever
dreamed of by most money reform
ers. If the people want to hold their
own money for safe keeping it is
their right to do so; and we should
have such a volume that hoarding
■would not destroy our banking sys
tem as it has in this crisis.
The government has poured 200
millions into the banks to save them
and it now proposes to borrow 150
millions more to pour into the same
rathole. And the people will have
the interest to pay and may never
get a dollar of this money back from
the banks. Such stupendous folly
was never heard of before. The gov
ernment has power to make mon
ey—full legal tender currency—and
yet refuses to exercise that power.
The great thinkers of the nation
have all along been calling our at
tention to our money shortage, but
no heed has been given to them. The
banks have been clamoring for “as
set currency” to supply the short
age but Congress turned a deaf ear
to their cry; and, bad as the scheme
is, it would no doubt have tided us
over the present panic.
A shortage of money has been the
cause of a shortage of railway cars.
A shortage of cars has prevented the
railroads from making the dividends
necessary to float their watered
stocks; and so the slump in stocks
came. This destroyed the collateral
necessary to sustain bank credits.
Bank credit being curtailed and with
drawn caused the shortage in curren
cy volume; and our exceeding pros
perity made it possible for the peo
ple to retain in their possession a
large percentage of the real money,
or currency, and this made the mon
ey shortage still more acute, so
you see that our prosperity made the
whole matter worse. All of our trou
ble can be traced to the inadequacy
of our money volume.
