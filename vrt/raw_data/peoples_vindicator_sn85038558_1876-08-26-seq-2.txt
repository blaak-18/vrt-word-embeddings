11th Ward iRadical Speeches.
What their .ptdilioanism' is.
We produce elsewhere "Notes of
the Ilth Ward" Radical meeting, ta
ken by a Committee of the Demo
cratic Club of that Ward ; which our
readers will see are nothing but a re
hash of the old lies our people have
been in the habit of listening to from
these fellows, for the past eight years,
told on other people, and in a more
bungling manner.
We now propose to give these fel
lows a small "hlift" in public estima
tion, and we ask particularly that
our colored people should read care
fully what we sany.
1st. Bill. Tnnard, who now Ore
sanmes to be the true friend of the
colored man, was the blnckguard who
first fntrodu'ed the Society called the
A"Knights of the White Camelia" in
this town, and one of the oaths taken
by this noble (f) son, was to nerer vote
for a negro for ofee! This was in
1868, and in 1873, three years ago,
mind you, lie wrote a letter to the
Editor of the Gazette-Coret, a Demo
cratic paper published at that time in
iEast Baton Rouge, which we now
have ; that "he had no faith in the
honesty of .the Radicals here"--that
he did not go with them as a matter
of choice, but simply for bread, that
he was a Democrat at heart, and a
Radical simply for pay, and he tried
to get a situation upon that Demo
cratic paper, in order to cut loose
Ironm the Radical thieves here.
Bill Tunnard cannot deny this, and
it goes to prove, conclusively, timat
Tunnald is ready to go back to the
Democrats it he could do so-that lie
never was a Radical, sav.e for con
venience.
2d. Breda, of whom it is useless to
say more than revert to the fact, that
he is under indictmeat for robbing a
poor negro of three Anndred.dollars ;
that is amply sunfleiert to show his
friendship, and the extent of it, for
the negro.
But of his natural talent as a liar,
we most all have as profound a res
pect, as we do for his low-dfung in.
stnocts and blackgnardism, when lihe
produces those documents on Tilden
and the New York State debt, for the
facts of the case are just to the con
' trary. Governor Tilden reduced the
State debt of New York many mil
t lions since be became Governor, and
be has reduced the taxes from $15,:
727,482.08 to $8,268.lg6, and that too,
without repudiating forty per cent of
it, as. Kellogg did with the Louisiana
State debt.
As far as New Orleans is concerned,
that is very easily answered, by sim
ply stating the fact, that the debt o
that city was contracted by the Radi
calparty, who are perfectly and fully
responsible for the "$100 tax on each
man, woman and child," in that city.
Breda's speech would never be
complete frithont that "say it louder
of his. . It cheers him up to feel that
some few negroes, at least, can be led
by a thief and a blackguard, such as
ths community know him to be; andi
if his g~ittni-pereba conscience is not
too hardteied, he must frel the eom
d munity3is about correct in their esti
f mate of his character.
3d. J. O. Lewis is so atterly and
Seompletely devoid of character, as tc
be almost unworthy of niotice,- but,
Ssafice ite is up hlie is subject to criti
e- am ad o we ask his opiniOn of r

Myers.
Myers; yon all know Myers f-as
onory a cur.ns ever pilfered a hen's F
nest for stale eggs or stole a bone; a
he has come again, boys, and looks as Ii
smiling, as enthusiastically pleased a.t G
ever looked him l
"That slit throats or scuttled ships." c
If our poor memory does not stand la
in fault Myers fired a train and left ti
here before it exploded, some time in
the latter part of 75. C
Myers is a funny fellow; Msers'
only faults are that he will lie and C
will steal ; small faults, it is true, t
among the company lie keeps. Myers
robbed the school fund of-let's see,
the Grand Jury says $17,000. We
are particular in figures because My
era is ; but the Grand Jury says that
$13,00 more is covered by Myers in
the way of Brown's certificate. Myers, e
at all events, "got away" with $17,- a
000 and failed to procure Brown's re
ceipt therefor. Myers dodges this t
parish with the eagerness with which t
a raw recruit dodges a cannon shot, a
Swhen; court is in session. He slips over
into Missisaippi in order to enchant
the view of this parish, to which they *
say distance lends a willing hand- t
speaking of lending and a wi!liqg
t hand, Myers is ever ready to lend one
r to plunder, from a pauper's pay to a
t school fund, which is about nil lihe
will lend. But we digress. Myers a
comes hack "all in a glow," filled
with patriotic fervor and ready and
B willing to "lend a rnid"in the salva
tion and support of the tag-enders of
whom Blunt, the sacrilegious son of I
t a sea cook, is the "pint."
l Tfey are all here and "what a pooty
B time" ;.what a delightful opportunity
for those bloody white leaguers, of i
whom Myers told so much, with the
Shelp of Mistress Myers, to go in and
Stake their bloody scalps.
In 1874, we think it was, but our
poor bead can scarcely retain' dater
Sof so long ago. Yes in 1874, Blunt
r and Boullt and Myers all were here.
They robbed these people of notold
thousands, and when the people would
stand it no more, they "rose and. drove
then out"; but after a few days My
ers and Boult and Blunt returned,
n and with them came those "boys in
e blue" for which radical thieves, like
Myers and Boullt and Blunt call
e when caught in 'nefarious acts. Cit
- izens were arrested and harried; ne
d groes were intimidated, white men
ran to earthli; and what for That
i Boulit might show his pleasing friend
ship for the masses by tasing them
'a eiglit per cent ; that Myers might
continue to "bulldooze" the school
treasury, and that Blunt night "pro
tect his right," to burn up Natchito
if ches, drown Faulkner's mule and
imake speeches in favor of the free and
Sunbounded right of a negro to do as
he d--d pleased without "let or hin.
Sdrance."
1e Myers has come and our poor par
ish is again "snowed up.'
Blent is here, ready to stump the
Sparish in the interest:of his parasites.
a Boullt has returned with. the cant
d of democracy on his lips, which he
't swallowed within a week, and hell in
- lhis heart.
And with all this we simplyf ask a
d question and propound that question
to all fairmiqded,people. Is it ex
pected that the white eitisens will
submit quietly to the role of Blunt,
Bonilt or Myers?

Packard.
This individual has invited Gen.
Frank Nicholls to canvass the State, pi
and to a general discussion of the po- w
litical issues of the day, with him. lt
Gqn. Nicholls will no doubt Oeercise I
his own opinion in accepting or de- k
clining this invitation ; with that we w
have nothing to do ; but. In the selec- S
tion of parishes for such discussion 11
we earnest;y entreat that Natchito- it
ches shall be left out. a
Gen. Nicholls has every welcome to at
come here, and at any time he chooses
to do so we will accord him an en- p
thusiastic reception ; but if it is with it
this fellow, Packard, we must decline
furnishing an audience. E
li 1874, on the 20th day of October, a
if we mistake not, one Stockton rode m
into our quiet little city at the head a
of a body of United States cavalry si
and proceeded to arrest a number of C
citizens without warrant of law, and
to harry our leading people, drive a
them to the woods, Insult women and p
children and outrage law and liberty
generally.
The citizens of this parish have not o
yet forgotten that. The arrested par
ties are still alive and cherish the
hope that an hour will come to make c
all thinogevbn with the prime instig
ator and head of these outrages, S.
B. Packard, and this is our reason for
declining in advance the honor (f) of
a social visit of this damnable fiend.
If he comnes, let him come as all rad
icals do, as an alien and an outlaw a
to society. Let him sneak into the
parish like a car, and out the same a
way.
We have no audiences, no greet
ing for Packar and his crew. We t
know what they are, and what they
will do when in power. As soon would I'
we invite Mat. Wells or Tom Ander
son to our midst, as this head centre
of all the villainy, murder and out
Srages that have been perpetratefin I
our parish for the past eight years.
No, no ! We are not yet prepared
with sufficient christian fortitude to
submit to this degradation; es
I tending hospitality o the man
e who has invaded every right we pos
. sees; who broke down our social bar- 1
riers, dragged our eitizdhs into ear
alry camps,.insulted our women under
0 our own roofs and who has made him.
e self an outlaw to all feelings of kind
II ness and hospitality.
A Misanderstandig,
n Tie people of this Senatorial and
it Judicial District, have, we suppose, a
- perfect right to discnss among them
a selves and for their own enlighten
it ment the relative strength, capacity
l and aaviiability of their respective
- candidates for office. lut the .great
º- mistake lies in supposing that we do
ad not intend voting the ticket because
Swe discussour likes or dislikes of the
is men nominated.
t Onr radleal enemies suppose a great
deal of thil themselves; in fact deal
r id tlhis imagination to a fearfut extent.
Our peolte will vote for tile worst

Scause they know what radicalism is.
et We earn that there has been dn
in ring thie week, a conferance of some
of thile leading jail-birds of the radical
a party here, and parties from Red Rir
a or parish, with a view of fixing up
I- things to take advantage of the sup
Ii posed split in the Democratic party.

Be Prepared.
It Is well our cititens should be o
prepared to meet any emergency ; to
withstand any viCessitude these try
ing times may develop, That troops
will be used, and that freely, we all
know full well. There is but one
way for the radicals to carry this
State and it was fully shown in the b
WVheeler report in 1874, which is by a
intimidation and violence; by the it
use of troops and the harrying and r
arrest of white citizens.
Let our rwhilte people he fully pre- d
pared to meet this onslaught of Grant's v
hired minions.
We will act calmly and hottor.bly a

Perfect your organizations-be calm
and prudent ; and above all be pre
pared for any and every emergency Ir
Some journals have a notable way t
of defending their people, and we I
think the New Orleans Bulletin pur
sues a most "crooked" and singular
course to that end.
.A few weeks since, we fell under I
the displeasure of its "Knight of the t
tripod," and he proceed in the most
amiable manner to giv as a di-4 in I

in what manner, we have never been
able to learn, but the slap of that po
litical pedagogue, of the Bulletin, has
afforded "collumn room" for several I
of the organs of Radicalism, who, no
doubt, thought It rather a good thing,
and rather gallant, to fire into as from
the shoulder of the Bulletin.
We confess in our rural ignorance,
not to be able to see the point aimed l
at by the Bulletin, and our child-like
simplicity leads us to think that it

NOTES
of the 11th tdr~l ReptiblicaitMasl
meeting held sear Carrolt
James', Natesitechee par'.
ish, La., Augut 19th,
1876. t
The first speaker was Tunnard, r
who stated that he was not a Uarpet- d
bagger i that all thle .andiy lie made e
was in the State of Louisiana, where f
he was raised; and made a eulogy of I
his political career, from Maj. Cromie's (
reign to the present time. f
The second speaker was J. E. Bre- t
da, who appeared on the platformn
with his hands full of papers, from t
which he pretended to read articles
derogatory to tile ailtlies and char
acter of the P'residential nontlteea of
the Democratic patty. Stating at the
same time, that .Mr. Tilden, as Gov
ernor of New York, had increased
her debt from 83,000,000 of dollarsi to
I lli,000,00() of dillars. Whleri.ta,
Kellogg, since ie had 1ecoite Gov
ernor of the State of outlsiana, had
reduced the State debt ten millions of
dollars. fiThat he ctuld not say the
sante of the city of New Orlkttns,
whose flnatelail affairs had been so
badly managed by the Deitcrats that 1
there is a city debt of One Hundred
Dollars tax for every man, woman
-anti clild, ill the city. "lWot't yout
vote the Radical ticket I" said he.
Cries of yes! yes ! "Say it loender,
so every body can hear you." Yes!
yes !! Breda "lhat sounds louder I
than the Democratic anvils of Natch I'
itches."
Next comes J. GO Lewis, who said
I he needed no Inttodection, for every
body knew hIma well enough. He
spoke bitterly of Nicholls, who having
been educated at West Point; fos
tered by the US. 8. Government, took
up arms against said Government and
I fought to "keep you in slavery."
"Can you vote for him." Cries, no!
no! "Say it louder, so they can hear
von ip Natchitoches." "No! No!"
He further spoke of Nicholls, lbeing
half a man, because lie hadtlt one
arm and one leg, and that hie could
Sgrasp but one side of thie question ;
and that he wanted a whole man who
could grasp both sides of the ques.
tion. Cries of "yes 1 yes!" "Dat's
sol!"
Then camne Raford Blunt, who de
'' nied all the incendiary charges made
against him in the VINDICATOR of the
19th test.; denied having promised in
the presence of Judge Chaplin, that
Slie would quit polities, and try to
t serve Ils God ; and that Judge Chap
I lin could not come before him and
say Ms; for he could 'Tee any man
Is who made such charges against him..
A voice in the crowd, "it is a lie !"
t and Blunt answered, "it is worse than
a that." That the mano who votes tihe
Democratic ticket would lose his
I. rights at the ballot bar, and that lie
cound no longer sit as a juror. Should
i the Democratic party come into pow
ia r, his'l urch in Natchltolches, and
5 all your hurchles would be closed;
e and tllmh le the reason why be does
a not wish to see the Democrats in
n power. He does not want the Demo
a crata because they would do as they
did in Tetas, i. e. use the school funds
e to pay. the milage and per diem- of
