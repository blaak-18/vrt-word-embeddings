What Our Farmers Are Saying
________and Doing
METHODS FOR SKINNING THE
FARMER.
By Henry S. Reid, Atlanta.
I was talking to one of Georgia’s
oldest and best cotton growers the
other day and, of course, we drifted*
in a comfortable way into cotton and
the conditions surrounding the crop.
I said, “Colonel, are you selling
your growing crop for 12 cents per
pound?’’ “No,’’ he replied, “because
if cotton goes off for any reason
those who agree to pay the 12 cents
will grade my cotton down to such
a point I will get only what it is then
selling for.” Continuing, he spoke
in vigorous terms of 'the methods
and manners for skinning the farm
er, which brings up the virile sub
ject embraced in government classi
fication.
Indeed it is high time something
was done by the “Great White
Father” to guarantee the producer
the market price for his staple.
Middling cotton, the base of cot
ton prices the world over, should be
a recognized quantity; that is to say,
middling cotton should be the same
in Savannah it is in Thomson; the
same in Galveston it is in Boston, and
it should be so understood. It should
meet certain requirements as to
length and strength and color and
fineness, so that the cotton man and
the cotton farmer, too, if he wished
to know could tell when middling
cotton was up for inspection and
sale. As it is, each man who buys cot
ton, if he is so inclined, can defraud
the producer out of much money by
wrongfully classifying the farmer’s
product, and, as is always the case,
where a farmer comes in contact
with “the interests,” the man who
made the crop possible gets the little
end, or the hot end, or the worst end
of the deal.
The outlook for the crop of 1909,
based on a careful calculation taking
into consideration condition, acre
age, etc., is for about 11,500,000
bales, or perhaps 500,000 less. If our
crop does not go beyond this, and the
interests federated for the purpose
of depressing the price are not per
mitted to carry their warfare against
the American producer too f#r, the
prospect is good for 12 1-2 cents,
possibly 15-cent cotton.
If our people would keep in mind
the fact that the mills of the world
are being added to every year, cre
ating a greater demand last season
for American cotton, and that these
new mills, nor old ones, could run
were it not for the cotton lint of
Dixie, and that by marketing slowly
so as not to glut the markets, the
price could always be maintained at
a reasonably high level. lam a firm
advocate of organization, and am
doing, in a quiet way, all that I can
to further the full co-operation of the
Southern people that they may more
effectually combat the concentrated
efforts of the British interests, aided
and abetted by the American mill
man. The idea entertained by some
well-meaning people that the mill
man and the producer can come to
gether and operate along lines con
genial and beneficial to both might
just as well be exploded at once, for
their interests are too far apart to
ever come together. One is deter
mined to buy as cheaply as possible,
irrespective of the loss entailed to
the whole people, and the other in
terest wishes to sell at as good a
price as possible that they may share
in the prosperity of the mill man.
All moves and all meetings with the
object in view of bringing mill men
and producers together is time lost,
wasted energy, a fraud on the very
free of it.
The arch enemy of the producer
is none other than the vain and port
ly C. W. McCarra, English all over
from the ring of his heavy heel to
the crown of smoothly ironed
beaver. The British newspaper man,
taking an interest in the Lancaster
shire mills, eulogize the said vain
and portly McCarra by calling him
the conqueror of King Cotton; the
man who “busted” Sully, and the
man who will all the time regulate
the price of American cotton by forc
ing lockouts and spreading his views
over the American cotton belt for the
purpose of weakening the knees of
men possessing pliant backbones.
To counteract the influence of Mc-
Carra and others like him organiza
tion is needed in this country, and
needed badly. I mean organization
that organizes, that crystalizes our
people into an organic body of force,
because the brutal efforts of this
Englishman must be met in a man
ner at once forceful and direct.

A WOMAN AND HER MOUSE FARM.
A woman in western Massachu
setts, according to the Farmer’s
Voice, makes a living at the unusual
occupation of mouse farming. Last
year she sold 8,000 mice and rats for
experimental purposes. They were
bought by the laboratories for use in
the study of tuberculosis and various
diseases. The animals are artificially
infected and the results studied by
observations carefully recorded. Mice
are used in greatest numbers at sls
to $25 per hundred. Rats sell for
about $25 per hundred. The animals
are kept in cages and the farm build
ings. Besides rats and mice the live
stock includes several hundred gui
nea pigs and a number of rabbits.
Some of the animals are of rare
breeds and are sold for pets. They
are fed on grain principally.
Raising ducks in connection with
the other fowls makes a good side
line for the poultryman.
TWO SUGGESTIONS.
The Philadelphia Farm Journal
suggests the following remedy for
lice on hogs; get a post in your hog
*. * L ' > * •*
Jeffersonian
lot, wrap the post tightly from the
ground up with quarter-inch rope,
and saturate the rope every few days
■with kerosene. The kerosene will
kill lice, and the hogs will keep on
scratching against the post.
Also, the best way to break up a
sitting hen is to put a Teddy bear in
the nest. This will scare the sit out
of any hen as soon as she goes to the
nest, and is something new.
Be careful about disturbing the
turkeys’ nests, as they are said to be
very particular about this.
Do you know which crops netted
you a profit last year and how r much ?
Do you know what animals you fed
and made money on? Os course you
don’t if you kept no accounts or rec
ords. Quit such reckless methods.
Do your farming as the business man
conducts his business.
THE REASON WHY.
The reason why so many enter
prises started by farmers fail is they
place incompetent men at the head,
writes Mr. Grant, editor of the Na
tional Co-Operator. Business fitness
and business qualifications are not
considered as a rule. Some man is
nominated because he is popular,
and is elected, inducted into office,
and usually undertakes to do busi
ness that he knows practically noth
ing about.
Failure in many cases is the re
sult, then the disastrous results are
attributed to dishonesty, in
fact it was ignorance of business or
business methods. We have so many
object lessons along this line that it
appears to us that the farmer would
learn better.
Another thing, the union is always
hunting cheap John employes; the
salary offered no first-class man could
possibly take. It appears that our
people had rather take a cheap John
and consequent failure than to pay a
successful business man a reason
able salary and succeed. The Farm
ers’ Union must get out of this kind
of business and get upon a higher
plane. Then business success will
come to us, and the complete confi
dence of the people will be given.
FARM NOTES.
Separate good, rich cream, then
churn it at a lower temperature.
Milk is used raw, while most other
food products are cooked in some
way. The very fact that milk is a
raw food should stimulate those en
gaged in its production to the great
est possible care.
Never put warm cream and cold
cream together. Use separate cans.
Don’t say you can’t afford it. You are
in the dairy business every day in the
year. If conducted properly there is
money enough in it to buy all the
necessary tools.
Milk may be unclean and unfit for
use from either internal or external
causes. The cow may be diseased or
thp surroundings and the utensils
