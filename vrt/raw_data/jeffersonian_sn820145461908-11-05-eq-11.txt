Heart
Troubles
The heart may be weak
just the same as the eyes,
stomach or other organs.
It often happens that a
person is born with a weak
heart. Then again dis
ease, fevers, over-exertion,
anxiety, nervousness,
rheumatism, etc. weaken
the heart. The result is
shortness of breath, pal
pitation, pain in the heart,
or in some of the nerves
of the chest or abdomen.
The • heart should be
strengthened with a tonic,
and for this nothing equals
Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure.

The Ad Man's Galley
By fames Lanier.
It’s a curious fact that your home
would be today without many of its
conveniences and most of its luxuries
if the newspapers and magazines of
the country were not in existence.
That comfortable bath-tub which you
put in last summer, didn’t you read
about it in some magazine? Would
you ever have thought of it, if you
had not seen that advertisement? The
fountain pen that is so handy —
didn’t you get the idea of having
one from the ad in the Jeffersonian
Magazine?
Would the makers of these articles
be able to gain their living out of
manufacturing them, if it were not
for the newspapers and periodicals?
Tn the boyhood of some of our old
subscribers there were mighty few
conveniences, and if there had been
as many as there are now, you
wouldn’t have heard about them, be
cause there were no magazines or
papers tp explain how they worked.
Do you know that the making of
books today is a small matter, and
that four-fifths of the printing in the
country goes into periodical litera
ture? There are about 22,000 period
ical publications in the United 'States,
and their circulation runs into mil
lions. They are as inevitable as death
and taxes. Even the old woman,
back in Arkansas, who had never seen
a train and “didn’t want to see the
durned thing,” had the walls of her
room papered with comic supple
ments.
The wide distribution of the news
paper is due to the extension of the
rural free delivery, for which we have
to thank our editor. The dweller in
the city no longer has a monopoly of
news. The circulation of the Jeffer
sonian, for instance, is mainly along
the rural routes, among the farm
ers/ fruit and truck growers, the or
chards, plantations and ranches of the
South and West. The two Jeffer
sonians are read bv those who make
the food that others grow fat upon.
And the people read the Jeffer
sonians because they like them and be
lieve in them. There’s many a farm
journal you can get for twenty-five
cents, and even ten cents, a year. It
contains a little cheap fiction, some
recipes and hints, articles taken from
the United States agricultural re
ports, and a lot of high-priced adver
tising of patent medicines and mail
order houses. It is taken because it
is cheap, or to oblige a friend, or to
earn a premium; but it is not read.
The Jeffersonians are read “from
kiver to kiver.” Every one of our
hundred and fifty thousand readers
is a friend and a Jeffersonian. He
waits along the rural route, and
watches for the paper or the maga
zine. When it comes, he reads it
through, and wishes there were more
Then he goes out, hunts up a neigh
bor, and makes him read it. Down at
the cross-roads store it is handed
around, read and discussed; and so
the life of the Jeffersonians is as long
as the paper will hold together.
If you are an advertiser, don’t you
<sl>e
see the value of such a paper as this,
compared with the trashy farm or
home paper which is thrown aside
two minutes after the wrapper is
torn off?
To the subscriber the value of a
paper or magazine is measured by its
power to give pleasure or profit.
Look at the Jeffersonians from this
point of view.
The November number of the Mag
azine has three charming sketches by
the editor’s pen: “An October Day,”
“The Oddities of the Great,” and
“Pages Lost from a Book.” Read
this: “Give me To-Day, let me fill it
with the best that’s in me; and of
To-Morrow I’ll have no dread. To
strive for the Right as you see it; to
speak the Truth as you understand it;
to be as helpful to humanity as it is
in your power to be; to send sunshine,
and the impulse that lifts and
strengthens, into the lives of others —
if we do this To-Day, To-Morrow will
find us unafraid.” That is in the No
vember Magazine, and it is one pas
sage of many in this month’s num
ber, which educate the reader out of
a lower level of thought toward a
higher plane.
Such things artj not lost. On March
12th there was published in the
Weekly Jeffersonian a short edito
rial called “Strong Drink,” which
was reprinted, by request, in the May
number of the Magazine, under the
title of “The Wine Cup.” It was on
ly about two or three “sticks” long,
according to printer’s measurement,
but papers all over the country copied
it, and are still reprinting it. It was
translated into French, German,
Swedish and Bohemian, and it will
go down the line as one of the little
classics.
These are given as simple illustra
tions of the fact that the two Jeffer
sonians do have the power to please
and to educate. And they are not
unappreciated. All our subscribers are
missionaries. When we get in over
a hundred new subscriptions in a sin
gle day, it is evident that we are
gaining’ friends.
One of the tests of the worth of a
publication is the number of its sub
scribers who renew year after year.
Nearly ninety per cent of the sub
scribers to the Weekly Jeffersonian
sent in their renewals last month, and
renewals to the Magazine are com
ing in as fast as the mails can bring
them. From now until the end of
one dollar a year, and if you take
1908 you can get the Magazine for
both the Jeffersonians they will cost
you only four cents a week. If you
have a neighbor or a friend, who is
open to conviction, send us a quarter
or half a dollar, and we will put his
name on our mailing list for a trial
subscription. If he once starts read
ing the Jeffersonians, he won’t quit
as long as> he has breath in his body
and brains in his head.
