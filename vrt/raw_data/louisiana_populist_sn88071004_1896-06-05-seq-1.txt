In McLennan. Dallas and Upshur
counties the Democrats voted the ne
groes In their primaries. Poor old
Democracy, how fallen.
Money is a creature of law, and In
trinsic value has nothing more to do
with it than a livery stable man has
to do with the weather.
When the Democrats voted the ne
groes in the prmarlies In the various
couoties it was an acknowledgment
that they will be defeated.
Few of the old party leaders ever
learned the decalogue, and none of
them practice the golden rule. The
devil can have the whole lot.
If every man who complains of
money being scarce would vote the
Populist ticket we would carry the as
tion by an immense majority.
Lead men to see the folly of ens
taining their old party, by gentle
words. You can lead a horse to
water, but you can't make him drink.
The man who gives or offers bribes
to juries, voters or officials is the
agent of the devil and the anglsh, a
cemrMaution as ungodly as it is mesan.
We not only eave a Demoasatic de
Icleacy in Texas, but the Clevelanad
adminaItration has bequetbed as a
bonded debt. But such is Democracy.
Irredeemhble taury notes, based
on the wealth mnd patrot~Im of the

THE RECENT CARLISLE MEETING
AT CHICAGO.
GqSlea Up by Walking Delegates Who
Siber Met-It Has Helped the Cause
of Silver a Thousand Fold - some
Kyeopeners.
Probably no one thing of recent oc
rjrence has added more to the
b,-ength of the silver sentiment !n
Chicago than the so-called working
men's meeting addressed by Mr. Car
lisle.
In the first place, it was not a spon
taneous movement of the workingmen
at all, but the whe le thing was en
gineered by the "sound" money club,
and a few bankers. The workingmen
who figured, In no sense represented
the great labor organizations, and were
simply "decoy ducks." In the sense of
being a workingmen's demonstration
It was an out and out fraud, for it was
patent that a large majority of the
wrkiangmen present were not in ac
cord with the speaker. The boxes and
a considerable portion of the parquet
were well filled with federal office
holders, bankers, and other horny
handed sons of toll whose flashiny
liamonds, spotless linen and broad
cloth lent eclat to the occasion, and
gave a somewhat patrician tinge to an
assemblage that might otherwise have
been too plebeian in character. These
representatives of the labor element
clapped most enthusiastically at every
r reference to "sound" money and "hon
Sest" dollars, but the chaps who actually
do the work-when they can get any
to do-who had none of those dollars
r hnd did not know where or when they
would get any of them-these men gen
erally did their cheering on the other
side. Secondly, the speech itself was
so weak, and so thoroughly permeated
with false and ridiculous assumptions,
that the average workingman saw
'hrough it at a glance and it fell per
fectly fiaLt
Lastly, the meeting was conducted in
a manner altogether un-American.
I Numerous burly policem'n dotted the
hall, as if a riot had been expected.
Not a single attempt was made to In
Sterrupt the speaker, although the
hearty applause which followed his
references to free coinage may have
been deemed offensive to those who ex
pected all the applause to be on the
other side.
After the two hours' address was
completQ , Col. J. C. Roberts rose and
asked th( privilege of propounding a
question. He had to speak a number
of times in order to make himself
heard; but finallly fixed the attention
of the chairman and was about to ask
hib question, when he was abruptly re
moved from the hall by a policeman,
amid cries of "Shame! Shamer'
CoL Roberts is himself a speaker of
some repute. He Is as familiar with
the money question as Mr. Carlisle,
and has submitted to and answered na
numerable questions when speaking.
His summary expulsion was simply an
I outrage. Other gentlemen, knowing
that the'meeting was fraud upon the
workingmen, and that the great labor
organizations of the country are over
whelmingly for free coinage, quietly
passed around through the audience
sealed envelopes dootalaing the procla
Inatlon to worklngmaeQ, issued and
signed by Sovereign, Gompers, DIbs.
McBride, Robinson, Arthur, Butler,
McGuell, sad nearly or quite all the
heads of labor organizations in the
United States. The hall was open to
I the public for a public purpose. Those
desirlng to do so had jfot as muchb
ridght to distrlbute the proclamation
there as theywould have had upon the
street, provided, of course, they did it
without disturbingt the meeting, which
was a fact. But em sooner was it known
to th. management than the police, the
pherm, and others of questionable
authority were at once set at work to
stop the distributio. They did not
sueoed very well, bat they tried hard
enough, and the whole proceeding was
suggestive of "Darkest Russia."
A tfew more such meetings and
" sond" mosey will be about the
r 'deadest" thing that has ever polluted
the atmosphere of Chicago.--Ex-Con

The dispatches do not inform us
whether honest money I)emncrats actu
ally owe anything themselves, or
whether the "honest" dollars which
they so love are owing to them. A
man's opinion as to what constltutes
honest money is sometimes quite seri
ously affected by the position which he
occupies in life, and whc-ther he owea
somebody or somebody owes him. The
dl erence, of course, is only a trifle-
when stated on paper. Still it does
have an influence occasionally, and it
is entirely safe to say that if the bank
ers, money-lenders, and cukoo offce
holders he excluded from the enum
eration, the remainder of the five hun

make a rather thin assemblage, both iw
numbers and intellectual strength.

A Rotbhrhild Pamphlet.
Silver Knight: There Is being circu
lated throughout the country a pam
phlet entitled "Plain Talk About Free
t Silver." which has been iasued for free
distribution by the gold bug lie-mill
of New York. Twenty millions of
copies have been printed and sent out.
Rothschild has paid the printer's bill.
I Local variations are used in the differ
ent editions distributed in the various
states. A copy of it has reached this
r offce. It is without the imprint of any
s publisher or printing house, and the
1 miserable prostitute who wrote it was
ashamed to place even a nom-dc-plume
r on it. The copy in our hands was sent
from Concordia, Kans., and has stamp
ed on its title-page and cover the name
of "Renard Bros., Groceries and
, Queensware, Concordia, Kansas." It
e is appropriate that Renard Bros.
should sell queensware, probably they
are subjects of Queen Victoria. The
s pamphlet is marked "Price, 2 cents,"
s but Renard Bros. give it away to every
e farmer who trades a bushel of corn for
a spool of thread.
e The national ban1'rs in country
towns have all received consignments
of this pamphlet, with instructions to
harp it given away to voters by their
local merchants, free of charge, If pos
r sible; if not. to pay the merchants.
When the merchants are in their dqbt
1 or have to refer to them for favorable
rating in the Rothschild-Dunn-Brad
street reports, they distribute it free.
If Independent, they either refuse to
disseminate such stuff, or asik a re
compense for so doing. If Renard
Bros. belong to the former class, they
have the pitying sympathy of the
Salver Knight-Watchman: If to the lat
ter, then the Silver Knight-Watchman
hopes they are well paid tor distribut

to induce the farmers to ruin them
[ selves and thus ultimately ruin Renard

The highest bid which the Republi
can goldites of the east have made to
obtalh the votes of thi Pacifi coast
for gold monopoly is the offer to give
them the candidate for vico-presidept.
Senator Perkins' name is mentioned
as the man who would draw the largest
I number of votes to the goldites, and it
is proposed to offer him the pomination
Il exchange for a solid west for the
Rothschild combination. There is no
doubt that the west fully appreclates
the kindly heart and generous senti
manis of Senator Perkins; they realize
that he would like to be for silver if he
could, but they do not see how they are
to be benefited by making him vice
president. He would have no vote ia
the senate and no influence with the
administration, because the vice-preasi
dent never has had or never expects to
have any influence with the president;
he is always waiting for the president
to die so as to get his place, and that
makes the president mad, just as the
king is always jealous of the heir-ap
parent. It is a notorious fact that the
vice-president has less influence than
anybody else around the capitol. The
head doorkeeper of the cenate has so
much more power as to naturally ex
Cite the envy of every vice-president
who has presided over the senate. No
matter how much the west may love
Semtor Perkins, the suggestion of his
nomeination comes from the enemies of
the people, and we do not believe that
Mr. Perklas himself would like to be
vice-president at the price offered.
