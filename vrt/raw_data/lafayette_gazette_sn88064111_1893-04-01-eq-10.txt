.s*restoW ant d Uarmer: My
%pilois infele twated herewith is 188s4
teet with 1 foS tept s. This gives two
steLies with as much eec. room above
as below. It stands on a stone under
pinning laid up solid with mortar.
Each story is divided into two rooms,
oe 16x16 feet, the other 8x16 feet. The
lower floor is of elay and is raised 8
inmees higher than the level of the
ground outside. This insures its per
Seet dryness and in fact it is dusty
every day in the year. The 16x16 room
below is the roosting, laying and feed
ing room. When the ground is not
frozen they are fed outside. The 8x16
room is the sitting-room or hatchery.
It is often used for other purposes. For
instance as soon as cold weather came,
we put in three stolen broods about.
a quarter gown. It was a nice place
for them and they were better separat
ed from the rest. The outside door of
this sitting-room opens into a yard.
15x84 feet, closed by pickets. So when
a few cockereis are kept ever to be
slaughtered for the table, the hatch
ing-room and yard make a convenient
place for them. The upper floor is
divided into the same sized rooms as
those below. The large one is used in
winter for what might be called a
calisthenic gallery or exercising room.
An inch or more of sawdust covers the
floor. If tailings" are fed. some are
scattered on the sawdust. Ear corn is
usually kept on the floor all the time
for the hens to pick at. They seem
to enjoy themselves scratching in
the sawdust. During summer the
hens use it more or less to lay in, a few
loose boxes with nest eggs being placed
around the sides. The 8x16 room above
is used as a storeroom and in winter Is
a good place to jail broody hens. In
summer a rectangular coop twelve feet
long' and three feet wide is used for

form ten feet wide and fourteen long.
A partition which reaches from the
floor to the platform divides the living
room into two equal parts. Under this
platform is situated the laying-room,
furnished with fixed nests.
The light only reaches this from the
open entrance from the feeding-room.
An abundance of dust is kept stored in
the laying-room and is used all times of
the year to scatter under the roosts
and prevent decay and bad smell of the
droppings. There is a special box of
ashes placed in a sunny corner where
the hens can dust themselves at pleas
ure. There are absolutely no lice in
my chicken-house, and the1pti;;

ing. 1=-.tieris there any leg scale dis
ease among my fowls, nor have they
ever had cholera. My argument in
brief is a perfectly dry dirtfloor, plen
ty of room and plenty of dust. I never
set hens until June and want the chick
ens hatched in July. Hot weather is
just the thing for them. At five months
old the pullets are laying and continue
to hay throughout the winter. The
profit is in the eggs.
TIMELY SUGGESTIONS.
slow Roads Can Ite .!ade Good In a Few
Years.
Good roads can be made in the fol
lowing manner: (Irade themn to about
two feet in the center; cut a ditch on
each side of road: put tile in it large
enough to carry water from same: cut
your ditch not over two feet deep;
have a good outlet for your tile and
your toad will be dry.
Now haul sand. gravel or crushed
stone, whichever is the nearest to Vyour
road. Haul two loads on top of each
other. Leave half of road bare so
people can drive on it when weather is
dry.
WVhere there is sand or gravel within
five miles of the road it can be put on
at small expense. Four mills on every
dollar of valuation for five years will
pay for it, or twenty mils in all: four
mills on the dollar the farmer would
not feel very much, and in five year-s
he would have all good roads.
i~,t every landowner or taxpayer
haul at the rate of 81.50 a day for team
and driver in stilmmer and autumn.,
when the roads are dry, say three
weeks and three loads a day. and tin
fi.e years all roads will be gtood. Let
those who hIave no teams pay for their
hauling.--C. L. riinazer, in Farm, Field
and Fireside.
AMONG THE POULTRY.
PoULTRY should have plenty of grit
They cannot grind their food without
it.
W1HEN fattening fowl~ do not let
them run with the fo-ls that are not
fattening.
KEErP the hens warm at nic-ht, if
you wish them to lay, and do not crowd
them.
ONCE in awhile s:r a spoonful of
sulphur into the feed. It tones up the
systenm.
Ir the hens show a disposition to get
too fat, with proper feeding, fatten
them to the full exte..t and eat or mar
hket them.
As exchange says that charcoal is a
good fattening food for turkeys. Itt is
good only because it helps digee:.0n
and ansorbs the gases. Charcos, is
first-rate for fowls, hut in itself it hItas
no fattening pre-petrties. -. Farmer's
Voice.
COaJe 'Petrelem on Roost..
Crude petroleum should be applied to
the roosts occasionally, in order to
guard against lice. Dnuring the few
warm days that are litable to occur in
winter, with the animral heat of the
bodies of the hens, the house will
sometimes be varm enough to enable
lice to work. Kerosene is irritating
to Ute feet of the fowls, and for that
reason we suggest the use of crude pe
troleman instead
This Â·s: Ssx feet and 2s feet to

The wall ,is from 1 to s feet above
the surface- oitside. The stables are
on each end, and run erosswise of the
-buidin&. The cow stable is 15 feet
wide, 836 feet long and " eet high, di
vided into stalls 8 feet 9 inches wide,
and a box stall 9 feet 8 inches wide.
The stalls are just long enough to keep
the animals' heads apart. The cattle
are fastened with chains around the
neck. Weo feed them from the barn
foor; the grain and mill feed being fed
through doors, xl3 feet nearthe floor,
directly into the trough which runs the
whole length of the stable (except a
door at each end of cow stable to per
mit passage between stable and barn
floor). The trough is partitioned off
opposite each stall. We feed the hay
and fodder in a rack directly over the
trough, the small holes at the bottom
having slide doors and the opening to
the rack falling doors, so the stable
can be closed entirely in front.
The floor is first filled with dirt 8 or
10 inches deep and then with stone and
gravel, 8 inches deep, well tamped.
LABsE FARM BARN.
The manure gutter is 16 inches wide, 6
inches deep at one end, and 8 inches at
the other end, with a conducting spout
runfitng to the manure pile, where the
liquid manure can be run into a reser
voir if needed. The gutter is covered
with strips c strong timber 1xl; inch
es, and placed 1l inches apart. They
are made into doors opposite each stall
so that they can be raised up to be
cleaned. There is also a board, 10
inches wide, nailed on the side of the
gutter, under the hind feet of the ani
mals, thus making the gutter, or drain.
age rather, really 26 inches wide. This
kind of gutter has many advantages
over the open drain. The cows are
kept as clean as possible, we think;
and there is no danger of a cow, heavy
with calf, being injured by stepping
backward into the ditch. The ditch
receives all the water and a great deal
of the manure, which is tramped
through; and it can be cleaned out
every other day. .
The horse stable is 17 feet wide and
S36 feet long and 8 feet high, di
vided into five 5-foot stalls and one
box stall. The floor is graded so as to
slope back behind the middle of the
stall into a shallow gutter. They are
all fed from the barn floor.
Tie barn floor is 18 feet wide, 36 feet
long, and 14 feet high to loft. It is
laid double; the floors overhead are
single. There is a platform 8 feet high
running across the rear end of the
floor. Under this platform at one end
is the cistern; at the other end are the
stairs to the loft. Under the middle of
the platform is a door 10 feet wide to
drive out at, and on top of the platform
is another door lo feet wide for putting
the straw out of the barn. The
machine drops the straw on this plat
form and it can either be put out or
into the mow. The stock can all be
fed and- -'tered from the barn floors.
The stables can all be cleaned with
out wakt Llhl rpy.t.- -01b o6ee EanW
ling the manure with the fork. You
can hitch and unhitch your horses on
the barn floor and take them directly
into the stable. The doors into the
stable, one on each corner of the barn,
are all hung so as to open inside, thus
preven ling wind from breaking them.
The stock can be turned out to the
straw stack behind the barn on nice
days and watered from a trough which
is filled from the cistern inside. No
floors to rot; no rats to bother; every
thing handy.

THE ART OF BREEDING.
To Mnaster It Requires Intelligence and
liard tl ork.
It seems poor economy for farmers
to attempt to pose as breeders and es
tablish a herd of thoroughbreds on the
simple !knowledge of how to feed hogs
for mnarket, yet hundreds of men are
doing it annually. As a rule, unless
they ar men who have that spirit in
them that will not submit to a failure,
they generally retire from the business
the second year. To become a
breeder means more now than it did
years ago. says the Swine BIreeder.
The business has advanced, it is out of
sight of the time in which the owner
ship of a pig sired by a prize winner
signified the breeding of fine stock. 'T'o
do this a knowledge of the entire
science is necessary. One nmust know
pedigree, the standard, feeding and
management, and these he must know,
not a.s his forefathers, but fully up to
the advanced knowledgec of the active
men of to-day. The signs of the time
in everything point towards a record.
In the breeding ring as in the speed
ring, to be a success one must have a
record and that record must mark
high. The best records in the speed
ring are made in front ofthe pnea
matic sulkies. The best records In tihe
bre'ding ring are made by those who
employ every means to obtain knowl
edge: no one can to-day make mnch
progress in the science of breed unless
he takes advantage of all means that
are now offered for studySng the busi
ness and acquiring the work of the
past years, and upon that foundation
build up a business that will be in har
mony with the standard and progress
of the times.
Economy in Feeding.
When dairymen feed for quantity
and quality they will Lget better re
turns from sales than when they try to
economize the feed and let the result
be what it may. It is the profit of
each dollar's worth of feed that a
dairy cow makes, and the more feed
we can get her to eat the more pront
we get. The liberal feeder, who looks
to tbhe cormfort of his cows. that they
are wsll sheltered andl well watel'ed, is
sure Io procure liberal returns for all
thle care lie osa Istow unon them.

THE railroad grade crossings in AMas

mileage aggregating'1,9l22 miles and an
apparent capitalization of $95,898,000.

Trained , kirts.
Long trains must have a silk bala

cross-barred crinoline, which gives the

quire four widths of silk. which are
gathered to the belt, or nowadays, the
two center ones often are extentldedl to
the top of the low neck, whence they
fall in Watteau plaits orgathers. Demi

white satin weddling dresses, if the silk
is of an inferior quality, are lined ,ithl
a light weight of Canton flannel be

Clean them with Pearline. You can't get

Perhaps you think that some of the imita

"- use in washing clothes, would do just as
well in work like this. They wouldn't
hurt tinware, certainly. But they wouldn't
clean it, either, half as well as Pearline-besides, "don't
