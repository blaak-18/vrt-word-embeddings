Resolutions of White Schoolhouse
Local Union, No. 1201, of Thomas
county, Ga.:
Whereas, the Great and Supreme
Ruler of the Universe has in His in
finite wisdom removed from among
us one of our worthy and esteemed
fellow-laborers, Brother J. D. Busby;
and whereas, the long and intimate
relation held with him in the faithful

threfore
Resolved That the wisdom and
ability which he has exercised in
aid of our organization, by service,
contributions and counsel, will be
held in grateful remembrance.
Resolved, That the sudden removal
of such a life from among our midst
leaves a vacancy and a shadow that
will be deeply realized by all the
members and friends of this organi

Resolved, That with deep sympathy
with the bereaved relatives of the de
ceased, we express our hope that even
so great a loss to us all may be
overruled for good by Him who
doeth all things well.

UNION CITY EVIL-DOERS LOVE
DARKNESS RATHER THAN
LIGHT.
Now if the true Union men of
Georgia will live up to the light they
have through The Jeffersonian and
hear the evidence that Hon. Thomas
E. Watson is in possession of they
will turn out that conspired den of
grafters, and the fact will be clearly
demonstrated that The Jeffersonian
hias not attacked the purity of the
Farmers’ Union, but the corrupt
grafters in the Union, and the Union
brethren will also realize that The
Jeffersonian has been a blessing to
the organization by bringing to light
these deplorable and alarming facts.
The Jeffersonian first discovered
the Bank Wrecker Boodlehunter and
the two-faced Duckworth leading the
Farmers’ Union in blindness and in
darkness, and in a charitable spirit
gave the alarm and danger signal,
and to the surprise of many, of our
most unworthy President, big John
Lee, came to their rescue; the best
proof that he is one of the gang. We
heard one of the gang say that John
Lee had the Union' people of Georgia
at his will—what he said do they
would do; let John speak, and the
Union brethren would heed. The
gang all realized their guilt, but,
void of conscience, they told John
that Tom Watson is telling the truth,
but, now, John, it is up to you to not
allow the Union people of Georgia
to accept it as the truth. So Presi
dent John sends out the information
that it is some of Watson’s lies, and
the Locals sent in some resolutions
demanding an investigation, and
John informed the brethren that he,
John Lee, the President of the Farm
ers’ Union of Georgia, had the Con
stitution in his own hands and if any
member of any Local talked about
any Union City official that he would
make the Local expel the brother
and on their failure to do so that he
would annul the charter—and John
meant that thing. He took the char
ter away from the Local that Gaston
belonged to, to keep Gaston out of
the State Union, but Gaston joined
another Local and got in any how,
but he was put out all the same.
Now, Coffee county Union passed
some resolutions, and John went
down there, told the brethren they
must rescind or he would speak them
out of existence, but good old true
blues, told the unworthy big John
that their lives he could take, but
their integrity fie could never have,
and he put them out of business.
The latest, I am reliably informed,
is, that in John’s last circular he said
that the reason that Tom Watson has
put in to break up the Union is be
cause he tried to join the Union and
they would not have him, and it made
Tom mad. Ladson was not eligible,
but has been in several Union meet
ings. It seems that John can twist
the constitution so as to admit any
that he wants IN and put OUT any
that does not bow to little Union
City and dance to the music of the
Duck-boodle-lee. Now the Bank
Wrecker goes in; he may not be eli
gible to membership under the
Farmers’ Union Boodleducklee con
stitution, but he is eligible to admit
tance, and it is all the same to him
that gets in.
Now, brother Union men of Geor
gia, we are in a deplorable condi
tion. The Farmers’ Union News,
that was adopted State organ, is
used to cover up the Union City con
spiracies, and not for the dissemina
tion of Union news. Where are all
the resolutions demanding an in
vestigation of the charges against
that infamous gang? They were
sent to the Farmers’ Union News,
but they did not appear. Now I ap
peal to every true Union man that
reads The Jeffersonian to get his
brothers to subscribe, take to
your Locals, read out the scandals,
let the people know. I also appeal
to the brethren to hold on, and we
will get right some time. Read The
Jeffersonian and keep up with the
news of the Union. I am going to
keep up the fire, and going this week
to see a man that was in the closed
meeting at Union City and he will
tell me all about it, and I will give it
in next week. Some think that he
will tell me that the reason S. J.

WHY GEORGIA FARMERS HAVE
NOT BENEFITED FROM
THEIR UNION.
To the Union Officials of Georgia.
Your supposed huge institution,
now a straddle the fork of the wide
road which stretches aback through
the once wealth-heaped vaults of the
Union enterprises, now a-creep with
myriad ghosts of lured, tricked and
slaughtered victims, signals help.
Like the goal-gained mountain
climber, bent beneath his load of vic
tories plucked along the ascent, you
hesitate to choose.
Your present exigency is the in
heritance of all evildoers. Every
Napoleon must face his Moscowed
ashes, and in the anguish of his “Had
I but known’’ seek the advice of in
fants.
The broad, easy Southern pros
perity road over which you have
romped to your present heights lies
behind; ahead stretches its forks, one
piercing the clouds of possible attain
ment, the other the morasses of Hell,
and you, who are so fearless, so reck
less —with the salvation of others —
tremble and doubt your vision’s ac
curacy now that you read the sign,
“You have but one choice. There is
no retract.’’ Wisdom is your need;
wisdom you must have. Therefore,
don’t refuse to listen to the young,
the old or the in-between.
1 am giving my bit.
It has been offered to every one
of your committees, but they, under
your slick guidance, preferred the
soothing songs of the canary to the
hawk and eagle screams.
You nor none of your committees
care anything for the common laity
of the Union; but you eagerly, ego
tistically, accept a seat on the hot
air cushion in the seeming magicland
wagon.
I give you my bit because —
Ist. I have hunted your jungle
from a date prior to the organization
of the Union.
2d. Because you have inveigled
every Union enterprise of the State
to Union City and have murdered
them, looted them of their capital,
and buried them in the big Union
burying ground.
3d. I have had a most sacred re
gard for the Union, and have stood
firm by its every principle.
4th. I know the history of every
hook or crook or turn in the Union
from its founding to this date.
sth. Your decision means as much
to me as to any one.
You must decide, iand now, to cut
out the cancer which all the world
now sees, or it will be yanked out by
the delegates at the next State Union
at the demand of the laity.
The day is gone when your hypo
critical fake reforms will be accepted
as remedies.
You must now reform or be re
formed.
Your remedy is simple, it is sim
ply this-. Quit trying to concentrate
the powers of the Union, quit trying
to force th* people to support a head
office for each enterprise at Union
City. Do not try to control the whole
Union at Union City by one simple
headed man.
You were advised not to try to load
on the burden of the Union Cotton
Company at Macon as a burden upon
the people, yet you promised the
creditors that you w’ould see that the
Union shouldered it. Then, when the
protest of the Union was heard so
strong, you set in to beg out of it
some other way.
You were not satisfied with the
death of the Union Produce Co., the
Union Cotton Co., and, in fact, ©very
enterprise that the Union had ever
started —but you put in to have the
Consolidated Warehouse Co. at Union
City so that you could murder it.
You, without cause of any kind
whatsoever, hounded Brother W. W.
Webb until he resigned rather than
be entangled with a set of high-hand
ed crooks.
Now, why did John Lee and his
Union City band wish to treat Broth
er Webb so unjustly? If space would
permit I would tell you.
If the Hon. Thomas E. Watson is
so kind as to allow us space in his
valuable paper, and you will sub
scribe for it, I will continue this
piece under the head of “Why Bro.
W. W. Webb Resigned.”
Fraternally yours,
A UNION MAN.
