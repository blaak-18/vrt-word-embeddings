very bright for the success of the

The Attakapas Club, -which is
..---destined to become a very popular
organization, celebrated the "Glo
rious Fourth" by firing a salute at
day-break, and also from eleven
o'clock until noon. At 4:30 p. m.
the club repaired to the springs
near towf where they partook of a
most sumptuous repast, which had
been prepared by their lady friends.
The club and their guests all wore
appropriate badges symbolical of
the day. Prof. E. M. Heath de
livered a most beautiful oration
commemorative of the occasion, re
ceiving the applause and congratu
lations of the club and their guests.
The conventional bon-fire was much
in evidence-on returning to Car
encro there was quite a creditable
display of fire-works. Taken all in
all, the Attakapas Club have much
to congratulate themselves for, on
their first celebration of-the Glorious
Fourth.
In the last issue of The Gazette,
your Carencro correspondent was
made to say that the young gentle
men composing the minstrel troupe
of our place proposed givingtheir
first performance at "Flag Town,"
when as a matter of fact he stated
that Flat Town was the place se
lected. We understand that the
club is organized for their own
amusement, and will no doubt give
their Carencro friends the pleasure
of enjoying their initial perform
ance. The Gazette wishes them
every success.
Rumor has it that the authorities
propose giving Carencio a new
school building. Certainly there is
not a place in the parish where one
is more sorely needed.
To show what a deep interest our
people take in the cause of educa
tion, it might be stated, that at the
close of the last session there were
over 6o pupils in attendance at the
public school; while there are about
120 now attending the convent.
The following children attend the
schools as shown: Harry Lessley,
Chamberlain-Hunt Academy of
Port Gibson; Masters Aristide
Guidry, Weston Brown, St. Stanis
laus College, Bay St. Louis;
Messrs. Jules Jeanmard, V. Grenier,
Julien Champagne, L. Arcenaux
and Albert Lacasse, Pontchatoula
Seminary; L. H. Francez, Spring

arrangem~ents. to open the public
school at that place Monday morn
ing. Miss Campbell is one of the
most efficient teachers in the parish
and the people of Duson may con
gratulate themselves upon their good
Luck in having secured her services.

Correspondent.
Mrs. G. C. Addison and children
of Rayne, were visiting Mrs. A.
O. Budro, during the week.
The ladies of Scott met last

for the church fair were pased and
from all appearances they will be
successful.
Mr. T. R. Simmons, our efficient
teacher, has resigned his position
as teacher of our school and ac
cepted a position at Jeanerette.
We are sorry to lose such a worthy
man from our midst, and hope the
people of Jeanerette will learn to
appreciate his good services as we
have. We can highly recommend
Mr. Simmons as a capable teacher
and worthy of filling any position.
May success be with him.
We desire to remind the readers
of The Gazette that our grand
church fair will take place Saturday
and Sunday, July 24 and 25.
Several of our folks took in the
Glorious Fourth at Lafayette.
A great many of the Scott people
will take in the 14th at Rayne.
And in return hope to see many
smiling faces from Rayne on the
24th and 25th at Scott.
We are sorry to learn that Mr.
A. C. Prejean is still on the sick
list. We hope his recovery will be.
soon.
The ladies of our town are busy
rehearsing for the concert on the

Mr. C. Melancon, of Breaux
Bridge, was in Scott during the
week.
The committees are negotiating
for the celebrities of South West
Louisiana, consisting of the Breaux
Bridge, Broussardville, Rayne,
Scott and Loreauville bands. With
these five excellent bands at the
Great Scott fair and concert, there
will be music to soothe the most
impervious heart. The air will be
filled with music, and the birds and
Sousa's band will be back numbers.
ORTON.
A Burglar Escapes.
Louis Jean Baptiste. the young
negro who was charged with burg
lary and whose chances for a long
term in the penitentiary were guilt
edged, has escaped from the parish
jail and is now at large. During the
night time he succeeded, with the
assistance of another prisoner, to
unlock the door of the cell he was
in and then made his way, by
means of ladder, to the loft of the
jail and made his exit through the
sky-light. From the roof of the
jail he found it an easy matter to
descend to the ground with the use
of the lightning rod. Without the
aid of the other prisoner, Blanch
ard, it would have been impossible
for the negro to have escaped.
The reason that Jean Baptiste
was not kept in one of the steel
cages is that the officers wanted to
keep him away from his partnier,
Andrew Lewis, who is charged with
the same crime.
Jean Baptiste has not been caught
yet, but it is devoutly to be wished
that before long he will be brought
back to jail.
It you are a wise and prudent
buyer you will take advantage of
the genuine bargains in every line
of goods, now being offered by
Moss Bros. &,.Co., to rapidly re
duce their stock in advance of their
regular annual stock taking.

WILL BREAK GROUND
Before Many More Days- Mr.
Ferguson Coning.
The latest about the waterworks
and electric lights is the following
letter from Mr. Ferguson. It is
good news and will be received
with much pleasure by the people
of Lafayette. It reads:
NEW ORLEANS, LA., July 5, 1897.
Mr. Chas. D. Caffery, Mayor, La
fayette, La.-Dear Sir: Allow me
to congratulate you upon the pros
pects of soon having both light and
water. I hope to be in your town
some time during the coming week
with my bond for $0o,ooo and im
mediately thereafter will "break
ground." The details are all ar
ranged for material and I see
nothing to retard the work.
SVery respectfully,
J. M. FERGUSN.
Ten cents a roll is the price us
nally charged for wall paper of no
better quality or prettier design than
Moss Bros. & Co. are selling at 5
cents a roll.
No man canr, afford to carry his
own insurance. Put off no longer
your duty to yourself, your family.
The delicious soda-water at the
Moss Pharmacy is warranted to
cool you off this hot weather, and
keep your temper sweet.
A Card.
On retiring frown the public
school service, I desire to tender
thanks to friends, patrons and the
public generally for past favors and
the kind support given me through
out in the discharge of professional
duties
Whatever modigum of success
has crowned my efforts, may be at
tributed very largely to that accord
and harmony which ever character
ized the relationship between pa
trons and teacher, in the adminis
tration of the Lafayette Public
School. For over twenty years it
has been my esteemed privilege to
labor in as grand and noble a field
as e'er God committed to the
province of man-th.e training and
cultivation of the hearts and minds
of the young. In an humble way
I have striven not only to perform
the ordinary functions of teaching,
but by precept and -example, en
deavored to awaken and kindle
those aspirations and motives
which uplift the soul to higher and
nobler conceptions of the duties
and responsibilities of life and
prompt to their performance; in
fine to implant those fundamental
principles and virtues that form the
basis of true manhood and woman
hood. If I have sown a single seed
that may redound to the glory of
God and welfare of mankind, I shall
feel amply rewarded.
The respect and affection of my
pupils will ever be a source of ex
treine satisfaction and gratification,
when ',Memory, a pensive Ruth,
gleans the silent fields of the past
and finds the scattered grain still
golden and the morning sunlight
fresh and fair."
From my boys and girls I part
with feelings of regret, but I trust
and sincerely hope, that the charge
entrusted to other hands, will be
faithfully and coniscientiously kept,
and that the children will evince
the kind and respectful considera
tion which has ever characterized
their conduct.
In conclusion I would inform my
friends and patrons that I shall
continue my profession, and have
already made arrangements to open
a private school Sept. I. I shall
build a schoolhouse, fitted with
patented desks and other appur
tenances necessary to conduct a
first-class school. My charges
shall be reasonable and I earnestly
invite parents to call and consult
with ine before making other ar
rangements for tuition. Again
thanking the public for past favors
and hoping for a coitinuance of
same, I remain,
Very respectfully,
R. C. GREIG.
The Fourth of July celebration
at the Oak Avenue Park was not as
successful as it would in all proba
bility have been if the weather had
been propitious. Despite the bad
weather, however, a game of base
ball, bicycle and mule races took
place and the celebration was by
no means a failure.

next to Mouton Bros.
Ellia Mitchell, a dusky Ethiopian,
appeared before Judge McFaddin
Monday and swore out an affidavit
against her whilom lord and pro
tector, Frank Glover, whom, it is
alleged, struck his fair spouse an
ugly blow on the right eye inflicting
a very painful wound.
The smooth-faced young negro
who bears the illustrious name of
Billy Kersands is once more an as
pirant for Fpenitentiary honors.
Billy, it will be remenrbered,
served the State in that capacity
before, having spent six months
building levees. He is again
-charged with embezzlement, the
crime which first caused his down
fall. His chances for a second
term are said to be very good. i
Despite Jupiter's threatenings,
nearly all the members of the F. O.
C. T. Club did homage on Thurs
day afternioon to their charming
president's hospitality.
Quite an amount of business was
transacted and some left for further
debate. Mis. B3iossat with her
usual tact and grace invited the
assemblage to partake of choice re
freshments and while the palate was
being pleased, the eye feasted on
the lovely floral decorations and
dainty aspect of the table linen and
ware. Among the rhymic answers
to the question, "Why is woman
man's best friend ?. " many differ
ent reasons were assigned. The
prize for the best was awarded Mrs.
H. Kennedy, whose little couplet
contained much sweet sentiment
and thought. The trophy was a
handsome belt of latest style. By
a unanimous vote the "'booby" was
given Miss Lizzie Mudd for the
wittiest answer. Should any of the
readers desire to add Miss Mudd's
rhyme to their store of valuable
knowledge, perhaps the young lady
may be induced to have it put in
print. Her prize was a big sun
flower.
Miss Stella Trahan's reading of
"Benjamin Franklin's Toast" elic
ited much praise and so did Miss
Lizzie Mudd's instrumental solo.
Mrs. Crow Girard, whose sweet
voice always delights its hearers,
sang with much expression that
beautiful song, "It was a dream."
Miss Susie Hopkins' vocal solo with
guitar accompaniment was enjoyed
and this young musician will be
encored at an early date.
Insure your property with Lewis
& Ratcliff. We are here to stay
and give your business personal
attention.

A Letter from Lieutenant 3Moss.
The many friends in Lafayette of
"Jimmie" Moss will be pleased to
learn that he is meeting with much
success as the promoter of the
wheel in the United States Army.
Some weeks ago The Gazette pub
lished an article from a New York
paper giving the details of a pro
posed trip to be made on btcyles
by a corps of Uncle Sam's soldiers
under the .command of Lieutenant
Moss. The distance to be traveled
is from Fort Missoula to St. Louis
and return. In a letter of recent
date Mr. Moss writes to his parents
here:
CRAWFORD, NEB., July 3, 1897.
-".The bicyle corps reached this
small Western town about 1o
o'clock this morning. So far the
trip has been a success, althofgh
the work has been exceedingly
severe-rain, mud, water, grades
and bad water. To-morrow about
noon we will strike the much
dreaded sand hills of Nebraska: for
nearly 2oo miles we are going to
have an awful time pulling through
the deep, soft sand. After that,
however, it will be comparatively
smooth sailing until we reach St.
Louis.
"My health is very good, indeed,
and the rough, outdoor work. seems
to agree with me. I can't eat
enough, such an extraordinary ap
petite have I."
The Choctaw Club of Carentro
may well be proud of the manner in
which it celebrated the Fourth of
July. From all accounts it was a
brilliant affair, reflecting no little
credit upon the members of the
Choctaw Club. The Gazette re
grets that its limited space does not
permit the publication of the elo
quent address delivered by Mr. E.
M. Heath, who was, by invitation,
the orator of the day. Caretacro
never does anything improperly and
the Choctaws' first Fourth of July
celebration was characteristic of
the citizens of that thriving town.
