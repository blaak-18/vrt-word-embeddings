BLODGINS.
It was a matter of much thought
Totell where it began ;
It was too large a mouth to be
Upon so small a.man.
And were he coming up"the road
Far in the distance dim,
You'd see his mouth an hour before
You'd catch a glimpse of him.
Natnre'sesnblime economy
It showed without a doubt,
For vast material was saved
By leaving that much out.
'Tis said by these who knew him well
SThat from the very 'irst
lie always soed the'largest words
Whenever he conversed.
And when he had to pay a pawn
With just one kiss, no more,
The fair young damsels would complain
That each one counted four
While for vain-glorious forms of speech
He did not care af ig;
'Tis said because his mouth was large
He always talked quite big.
By men quite competent to know,
It has been truly said
His month could never grow unless
'T'hey did enlarge his head.
I've often heard of men who could
Speak volumes, but I'm sure
I ne're saw such facilities
For doing that before.
He had a alligator laugh;
And when he went to smile
I lie if 'twasn't visible
Three-quarters of a mile.
But, one day Blodgins disappeared ;
'Twas thought he had gone South;
But I stand ready to believe
lie crawled into his mouth.
What has Been Done.
That our people may understatid
what results have been accomplished
by our coup d'etat of the 14th Sep
tember, we propose to give them ex
tracts from leading Republican and
Conservative journals in the North;
a careful perusal of which will con
vince us of two facts. First that the
overthrow of the Kellogg usurpation
did not furnish to our political oppo
nents in the North murderous capital,
to ride into power upon. We could
not be howled at as rebels and cut
throats, bent upon the murder of ne
groes and Republicans.
Second, that the matter of recon
struction must be attended to, and
although they will not go back upon
what they have done, the North will
have to preserre herself from the eril
turder 'which awe labor, to qualify suf
frage in some way, either with an
educational or property requisite, and
that speedily.
Have we not then done good, not
only to ourselves but to the whole
Union, in this movement, in which
besides overthrowing a corrupt and
villAinous usurpation, therelh show
ing tobthe world that this RKellogg
government was not the choice of our
people; we have awakened the pub.
lic mind of the whole confederation
to the study of the startling flct, of
their being made soon to feel all the
horrors attending the practical illus
tration of the theory of Universal
sufferage. That it is no love for us,
no pity for our sufferings, that has
brought this about, we are ready to
aver-but they begin to see that this
canker cannot be confined to us for all
time, but is surely and speedily eat
ing into the very heart of the Repub
lican structure.
Let 's. then not mar the vantage
gained by any movement calculated
either tq throw discredit upon our
past Acts, or compromise one inch of
our position ; effected with the loss of
so msch time and treasure, and the
shedding of so much patriotic blood.
Hold on then, Fellow-citizens, "the
etep tenor of otr way," disturbing
the rights of no man, nor suffering any
one to disturb ours. Let every man
who holds biself worthy of the name
of freeman, REGISTER AND VOTE and
opr eucceas. ~ lbeyond adventure.
TBE TONE .OR THE NORTHERN PRESS.
The nation expects from the Presi
dent a manly and magnanimous course.
This people have never been disposed
to visit harshly upon the President
any of his shortcomings. It follow
ed font years of administration mark
ed with many errors by an endorse
ment in the shape of re-election such
as. has been given to no President
since Washington. This was because
the country believed that behind his
tendeany to error was the soldier's
honest sinqerity of purpose to main
tain the right. If General Grant
would not forfeit this esteem, and he
beamrs nothing riper in the full sheaves
of hi famrlet hii be jet to Louis
ians. Let him be just to the South.
Let him remember the unrdens that
rest upon that people--burdens which'
even under the brightest auspices
make reconstruction a sad and weary
labor. Let him give the freemen of
Louisiana a freeman's right in the
choice of his rulers. And having
done this let him throw the weight
of his office and his name in favor of
a notional convention of peace and
reconstruction, ruepresenting all the
States, to assemble in our centennial
year, to consider the grave and burn
ing problems resulting from the war,
whichi have brought us scandal in
Lonuiiamna, that may to-morrow bring
us scandals in Wisconsin, California
and Massachusetts-problems of re
construction, rights of labor, race,
railway and class monopolies, State
rights and finance. We cannot ig
nore these problems. We cannot set
tie them by the sword. The revolu
tion in Louisiana is only a despairing
prayer for their settlement. Public
opinion points the way, and it is for
the President to lead it.-N. Y.
Herald.
The people of Louisiana have, by
their prompt submission to Federal
authority, atoned for the previous act
of revolution. * * * The revolu
tionist have disbanded and surrender
ed everything. But Kellogg knows,
as all the world does, that the people
of Louisiana, as one mane demand
that he shall vacate the office which
he has never held by right.
If William Pitt Kellogg will not, of
his own volition, resign the guber
natorial office of Louisiana, he should
be compelled to do so by the force of
public opinion North and South. For
years upon years the Enquirer stood
in the front rank of those journals
which led public opinion in civiliza
tion's crusade against black slavery,
and while it fought, as well as it knew
how, against that monstrous wrong
against humanity, it is now as strong
ly opposed to white slavery.
It may be essential, and it would
seem to be essential, in order that the
forms of law may be duly respected,
that Kellogg and his horde of politi
cal adventurers should be reinstated
in office. But that being done there
can be no doubt entertained by any
unprejudiced or honest mind that he
and they should be forced by public
,opinion to resign their places, and
that the McEuery government should
be invited to assume the office to
whichl the people of Louisiana called
them.-Phibsdelplia Enquirer, (Rad.)
The wrongs the Louisianians suffer
are and have been such as would
have stung any other people to fren
zy long ago. Lamp posts in New
York would be as thick with corpses
as Jersey pine trees with crows, had
our people an experience one-half so
bitter as the people of Louisiana have.
-Brooklyn Eagle, (Rep.)
We must confess that the political
prospects of Louisiana are dark. Two
years more of Kellogg's rule, judging
from the past, will leave the entire
property of the State in the hands of
the tax collectors, the proper remedy
and the only remedy, likely to be at
all satisfactory in its results seems to
be a' fair unfettered expression of the
popular will of the el ctors of Louis
iana at the ballot-box. Anything
short.pf that is mere patchwork. The
power of the United States from time
to time suppresses the hostility to
Kellogg, but it fails to extinguish it.
Every now and then the United States
army is required to go down to Louis
iana and set Kellogg, like a child
learning to walk, on his feet. As
soon as the Federal power is with
drawn, down he goes. In conversa
tion yesterday he said that the out
break.of Monday was due to the with
drawal of the. United States troops.
What kind of a civil gdvernment is
that which goes to pieces as soon as
the army of the, UnitedStates marches
around the corner ?
Our neighbors of Philadelphia are
to be congratulated on the spectacle
which Louisiana promises to furnish
for the "Great International Exposi
tion" with which they have decided
to celebrate the close of the flrst hun
dred years of our national existence.
It would be mortifying enough, we
should imagine, for the people of the
United States to look one another in
the face on that occasion, and remem
ber Louisiana, and not Louisiana
only but a large majority of the
Southern States. We are bound, how
ever, to have our fashionable friends
from over the ocean present with us
also, and a very pleasant meeting we
shall all have together, no doubt.-
Evening Post, [moderate repubbead.]
The Worcester (Massachusetts) Press
thus alludes to one of Grant's little
weaknesses:
The fact that'the revolters of New
Orleans hinted to President Grant
that he did't understand the situation
in Louisiana has been made the sub
ject of considerable merrimoenot. Let
us consider a moment. Perhaps the
President's ignorance of the true situ
ation in Louisiana is not a laughing
matter. Even since the adjournment
of Congress, President Grant has been
away fromt Washington and separated
from his Cabinet. During this 4me
he has read the newspapers but little.
His papers were looked over by his
semetary, and when an important
item of news was found the l'resident's
attention was called to it. Sometimes
he considered it of sufficient impor
tance to be worth reading, and some
times he did'nt. His manner of expres
sing himself when the news of upris
ing was brought to him plainly showed
thlat he had no idea of the desperate
feeling throughout the State. On the
previous night he had tarried long at
the wine bottles of the Aztects and he
found it atmost impossible to coin
prehend the situation. We have very
serious doubts whether the President
has any clear ideas with reference to
the situation in any portion of the
South. If he has, why did he place
the whole matter of sending troops
South in the hands of Williams?
The New York Times; organ of
the administration, d:us briefly out
lies the situation in Louisiana :
There is open insurrection in a
State, blood has already been shed,
the recognized State government has
been ovel turned by an armed mob,
and if the Federal power does not in
terfere, utter anarchy will very soon
prevail. These are the facts, naked
ly stated-but how much there is to
modify these facts ! The people who
have risen against the State govern
ment have been ruthlessly plundered
and oppressed; the governor who
was turned out has abused his office,
and the State governmeut which has
tenmporarily been upset was a disgrace
to the whole country. If we admit
one set of facts, we most admit the
other also. No man can honestly sur
vy the condition of affairs without
out 4isgust. The spectacle of United
States troops being sent to New Or
leans to restore the Kellogg gang to
power may be pleasing to some peo
pie, but the general public can only
look upon it with regret.
We dind in the New Orleans Bulle
tin the following extracts from the
B.ooklyn Eagle, which claims to have
the largest circulation of any journal
in the United States:
The lawfully elected officials of
Louisiana have, forestalled the pur
poses of the oppressors of their State.
They have turned over to the regular
army officers, the buildings, arms and
etffects wrung from the usurpers, and
they have thereupon retired from
power, leaving the State in military
hands. It now devolves on the army
officers to do that for which they were
sent-which is themselves to reinstate
the IGellogg crew of pirates in place.
That.is a work which by analogy ex
actly reverses the least savory occu
pation of a scavenger. As it was
plain that the "movement" was for
effect only on the moral sentiment of
the country, and that it was devoid
of any chance for practical success,
owing to the identification of Grant
himself with the worst of villainies in
the State, so does it become equally
plain that the moral sentiment of the
country has been profoundly touched
by the movement from inception to
collapse. We think the abductors of
Charlie Ross are more charitably and
tenderly discussed this day 'than is
the admministration' which is %r-en
thralling Louisiana, even in the minds
of the men who raised it to power:
All the world sees it in its unrelieved
hideousness. All the' world knows
that Grant is wrong and Louisiana is
right, and we are willing to let that
knowledge workout its results.
As for the miserable cravens, rob
bern, swashbeucklers and chawbacons
"reiustated" in power, they raise to
the bettors of no person's contempt.
The "organs" which approve of their
restoration hiold their noses as the
gang emerge from their holes and
pass again to power. If they do not
find their heads in one county and
tieir boots in another before long, I
the most "loil' shrieker, who is not a
riscal at heart, will himself be' disap
pointed. The Louisianians endured
with patience, uprose with courage
and brilliant audacity, arranged their
true government with moderation and
honor, and easuccumbed to Federial
brauality with dignity. Their moral
victory over their despots is an al
most sublime slpectele, and Lee was
better off at Appomattox than his
captor is this day, lightfing his cigar
at the pyre of a State. It beconmes
more than doubtful whether even
Grant can. stomach his partners down I
there, and his assurance of infamy,
for Continuing in the wrong, because
he started in it, is one of the certain
ties of history already.

COcKnoACnHES.-Mr. Lowery, the
chief propagator at the Floriste dt
Paris, has given to the lRevale Ilot i -
cole his method of destroying cock
roaches, which are found veay des
tructive and annoying, both in green
houses and dwellings. This plan i.
to take a package of matches, and
dissolve the phosphorus on them in a
tluart of water, and make a paste
with this water by mixing it with a
pound of flour and six or seven ounces
of sugar. Place this mixture where
the cockroaches will most readily find
it, and it will destroy them effectu
ally.
Hiow To Mraxn KxIVEs.--Most
house-keepers have felt the need of a
recipe for mending knives, or rather
for thfsteuing knives and forks to their
handles. The following mixture is
recommended for this purpose in one
of our exchanges: Mix together I
pound of rosin and 8 ounces of sul
phur, and keep it either in bars or
reduced to power. Mix I part of this
powder with half a part of iron fil
lings, fine sand or brick dust, and
the cavity of the handle is to be filled
with the mixture. Heat the, stem of
the knife or fork and insert it hot,
and when cold it will be found tight.
Cony MEAL Solr.-The American
Agriculturist says: Corn meal soup
is an establised institution on our
own farm. We keep a half-barrel
constantly full of water, with a little
corn meal soaking in it. The horses
are allowed to drink all they wish.
We let them drink the first thing in
the morning, and again when taken
to work. When brought home at
noon, they are also allowed to drink
before being put in the stalls, and
again when taken out, and so at
night. By standing a few hours, the
chill is taken off the water, and al
lowing them to drink when brought
in from work, does not seem to hurt
them. If the meal gets sour, remove
it and feed to the pigs.
Fowls should never be permitted to
have access to the horse-stable, nor
the feed room, nor the hay mow.
Their rooms should be entirely sepa
rate from the stable, so that they
may not always be ready to slip in
whenever a door is opened; and that
the vermin which infest poultry may
not reach hones and cattle. It is a
well-known fact that fowls of all
kinds frequently drop a very sordid,
offensive, clammy, viscous order;
and when allowed to go on the hay
mow, or in the feeding room, or any
where in the barn, they damage more
fodder than we are wont to suppose.
We would as soon allow fowls to live
in the kitchen, and to hop on the
dinner table while we are eating, and
to roost on our bedstead as to allow
them to have free access to the horse
stable and barn. Some horses are al
ways afraid of fowls, and when one
enters the manger, or rack, the timid
horses will immediately surrender
their entire right, however hungry
they may be,.ta.thse lawless maraud
ers. And after they have scratched
over the feed with their foul feet, and
s,neared a portion of it with theiy,
filthy droppings, a horse mast be ex
ceedingly hungry before he will eat
his mess. Many a hungry horse has
been deprived of his feeding of grain
by a lot of bold, gallinaceous robbers
that had learned when and where to
till their empty crops with the feed
o~f a jaded hore. Let gates and bars
exclude fowls and pigeons from the
doors and windows of all horse-sta
ble.--N. Y. Times.
BREAKt'As :ROLLs--Take a coffee
cupfull new milk; two beaten eggs;
half a cup of fresh yeast; a teaspoon

should be mixed in this way at tea

We have used a wagon with wide
rinwheels, and found it convenient
on the farm, diminishing the draft
over mellow fields, and in fact over
all fields, for a narrow wheel will ct
into quite a firm sod deep enough to
add considerable to the draft,. The
priieiple objection we found against
at on the highways was the fact that,
differing so much in width from those
in general use, it could not ran In
the bottom of the rutformed by them,
but would have to make its own rut
poin the sides of the othets, thus lain
crteasing the draft. If all wagons, or
the majorty of them, were of this
charaeter, this diliculty -would, of
course, Ibe obviated and wider and
shallower ruts formed.--Rural Home.
