preacher. Then, there is the par
sonage, the presiding elder and the
bishop’s fund. Oh! there are so
many things and people calling for
our labor that when we get through
paying them, our own wives and
children have to go wanting for so
much we would like to see them
enjoy.
Then there is the foreign mission
ary craze. My! I wish you had met
the great Wm. J. 8., so your friends
could have had the opportunity of
showing the fanatics the strength
the anti-foreign missionary move
ment has gained. May be W. J. B.
will yet come across. I trust this
movement against the present meth
od of foreign missionaries will
grow till any preacher will be
ashamed to take up a collection in a
church, or out of it, for that pur
pose. A man who has money of his
own should go teach foreigners if he
feels it his duty. But a man in this
country, with no home of his own
and his children uneducated, should
not be required nor expected to give
money for such a purpose.
Here is a copy of a letter written
by Thos. Jefferson on this subject:
Monticello, May 29, 1823.
“I thank you sir, for the copy of
the letters of Paul and Amicus, which
you have been so kind as to send me.
While we have so many around us,
within the same social pale, who
need instruction and assistance, why
carry to a distance, and to strangers,
what our neighbors need? It is a
duty, certainly, to give our sparings
to those who want; but to see also
that they are faithfully distributed,
and duly apportioned to the respec
tive wants of those receivers. And
why give through agents whom we
know not, to persons whom we know
not, and in countries from which we
get no accounts, when we can do it
at short hand, to objects under our
eye, through agents we know, and to
supply wants we see? Ido not know
that it is a duty to disturb by mis
sionaries the religion and peace of
other countries, who may think them
selves bound to extinguish by fire and
fagot the heresies to which we give
the name of conversions, and quote
our own example for it. Were the
Pope, or his holy allies, to send in
mission to us some thousand of
Jesuit priests to convert us to their
orthodoxy, I suspect Xhat we should
deem and treat it as a national ag
gression on our peace and faith. I
salute you in the spirit of peace and
good will.”
So it will be seen from the above
that Mr. Jefferson went even farther
than Mr. Watson, and opposed the
principle, as well as the method, of
Foreign Missions. Mr. Jefferson
hated to see his people robbed by
both Church and State, and, like Mr.
Watson, was brave enough to ex
press and write his opinions. In this
day of high prices and low wages it
behooves the poor man to use econo
my. Many are giving to many
causes, because they have been
taught that it is a religious duty.
The greatest religious duty is, first,
one’s own wife and children; second,
his own parents, and brothers, and
sisters; third, his own country;
fourth, the entire world. Think of
the first three if they are all free
from want, then look beyond the
borders of your own country.

SENDS BOOKS TO HELP ALONG.
Dear Mr. Watson:—Enclosed find
one dollar, for which please send me
the weekly Jeffersonian for one year.
I am already a subscriber to the
monthly. I think of you often, and
sometimes want to write and tell
you how much I appreciate the
splendid work you are doing. I have
read many able articles on Socialism,
but no man has ever exposed its fal
lacies, and revealed its errors and in
herent rottenness as you are doing in
the magnificent series of articles now
appearing in your Magazine. They
are so plain that it almost seems as
if “a wayfaring man, though a fool,
need not misunderstand.” We are
upon the threshold of one of the
great crucial periods in human his
tory. It is an era of change. Noth
ing seems fixed or stable. We need
leaders and prophets, but, alas!
where shall we find them? Govern
ment has turned its back upon the
time-honored principles and ideals of
its founders, and, having flung chart,
compass and tradition to the winds,
seems bent upon sailing, unhampered
and unguided, upon an unknown, un
charted ocean of selfish centraliza
tion and greedy imperialism. Social
istic philosophy rides rampant through
a demoralized intellectual world.
Old creeds are crumbling with de
cay, or overgrown with the strange
vines of new theories, like deserted
castles; while new and unethical
faiths are springing up like mush
rooms in the night. The young gen
eration, just entering manhood and
womanhood, are impatient of re
straint, irreverent to tradition, dis
respectful of age and authority, and
decidedly latitudinarian in their
morals. Politics are corrupt and ve
nial. The business world awakes each
morning to find in the newspapers
some new and startling revelation
of commercial dishonesty. The
family ties seem loosening, parental
authority on the wane, the sanctity
and stability of the home threatened,
while the divorce mills grind over
time, with an already alarming and
constantly increasing ' volume of
kork. Sometimes I wonder, “What
is to be the end of all of this?”
Thank God for a voice like yours
that rings out clear and strong above
the din and confusion. May you be
spared many years to work. Keep it
up. Don’t be discouraged. You are
too wise and too strong to look for
your inspiration for your work
among the men and women of to
day. You have, even now, your re
ward in the consciousness of the fact
that you are doing your duty as it
is given you to see it. I know you
are a busy man, and I did not intend
to write so much. I see you are go
ing to write some articles on “Ro
manism” —I am glad. They are
needed. I have two books on this
subject that might be of some help
to you. One of them is “The Priest,
the Woman and the Confessional,”
by Father Chiniquy. It is authentic
and reliable. I have also a most re
markable book, by John T. Chris
tian, “Americanism or Romanism,
Which?” This last book contains
some exceedingly interesting and
valuable statistics, which I have seen
nowhere else. If you would like to
see either, or both, of these books, I
shall be glad for you to have them
as long as you need them. When

will you go to Florida? I hope you
are well, and getting along nicely.

A NOBLE TRIBUTE.
Dear Sir:—Put it to the Foreign
Missionaries until they can taste it
good. Mr. Watson, that subject is
sure hurting some preachers, and
they are feeling mighty mad; but it
is true, as you speak it. Seme people
are braggin’ because you won’t ac
cept that preacher’s challenge. I
tell them you don’t take up time
with a hypocritical mess like unto
that.
Mr. Watson, as I live, for a man
to walk up and abuse my wife to my
face would not hurt me any worse
than it would for him to abuse you
to my face. Go on with your work.
I believe you are for the common
people. I hope you will live to see
your principles reigning in this
country.
I have one daughter sixteen years
old named Georgia Watson, and I
have a boy fourteen years old named
Tom Hines Watson, and I have a
baby two years old which has not
been named. Please send me a nice
name for her, being as she is the
fifteenth and*last one.
May God bless you, and let you
live to bring the people to see their
mistakes, and have a good govern
ment. My respects to you.

THE NEW MILITIA LAW.
Editor Jeffersonians:— l should
like to know if the Jeffersonians are
of the opinion that the rights of the
States are not invaded by the Dick
Military Law? Can the State relin
quish a constitutional right?
S. A. BLACKSTONE.
Chester, N. H.
Answer.
The Jeffersonian has referred to
the Dick Military Law several times;
and there is a chapter devoted to it,
in “Watson’s Handbook of Politics
and Economics.”
The rights of the States are in
vaded by the new law. The way to
nullify this extremely dangerous
legislation, is to continue the old
State Militia—not organizing any
troops under the Dick bill.

THOMSON, GA., JANUARY 1, 1910.
WE REGRET THE LOSS OF A
FRIEND.
Deai' Sir: —My papa died January
1, 1910, and he was one of your best
friends. He believed in Tom W’atson,
and the principles of Populism, as
strong as any living man.
I will take his place as subscriber
to your Weekly and Monthly (his
name was Columbus Tootle), so I
enclose $2. Let the subscriptions
commence from January Ist.
Yours truly,
S. P. TOOTLE.
Route 1, Manassas, Ga.
Answer.
It is with deep regret that I learn
of the death of your father. You
may feel assured that I sympathize
with you in your loss.
We appreciate the good work that
you have done and are doing for our
Jeffersonians. T. E. W.
WHITE HELP WOULD SOLVE
RACE PROBLEM.
Mr. Tom Dolan, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: —I have just read your
article on the servant problem, anent
the increasing intimacy of the white
women in the cities with their negro
men-servants; and agree in toto with
you.
If I were trading at a given place
and found that negro clerks were go
ing to be employed in any capacity, I
and all my people would stop trading
there at once.
The reason city people do not have
white servants is because they do
not want them. Any poor boy or
girl in need of work —whether in the
city or country’—would be glad to
get many of the places negroes hold
were it not for the idea of occupying
inferior positions. The wealthy are
to blame for this idea’s prevalence.
Let the wealthy whites treat white
help as they should, and there will
be no servant problem.
Respectfully,
J. M. CHRISTIAN.
Calhoun, Ga., Rt. 5.
OFFERS FRIENDSHIP.
Mr. Watson: —I have just received
first copy of your paper. My ac
quaintance with you was through J.
K. Vardaman and his Issue, and I
am filled with sorrow that I didn’t
know you sooner. If you ever need
a friend call on me, and may God
bless you. Yours,
Sedalia, Mo. R. O. HARRIS.
