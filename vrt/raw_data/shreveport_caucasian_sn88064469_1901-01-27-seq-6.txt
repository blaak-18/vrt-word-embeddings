[CLhairman et th h ou i ' nar:tmo CO military
Taoth branches of eoneress. but there
are other things of vital interest con
nected with our military and naval es
tablishaments to receive consideration.
Among these is the proposition to im
prove and enlarge the military station
at Governors island. in New York hy.
which also eantemnplat's the daepaining
of the Huttermilk channel between tho
1Iland and the Brooklyn water front.
Though it Is essentially an army nitas
t:re. the proposed improvement iwould
greatly facilitate the operations of tlie
navy in New York harbor and the
Brooklyn navy yard.
Some months ago Secretary Root ap
pointed a special laitrd to'consiler the
subject of the expansion of Governors
Island and the cot'iatration there of
much of the work carried on at various
points in the vicinity. In general the
board, which was composed of General
John It. Brooke. Colonel (eorgae L.
Gillespie of the engineer corps an I
Colonel Amos S. Kimball of the quar
termaster's department, was lnstritrted
to lay out its work on the follewint
uines: To provide barracks and quar
ters for at least. one battalion of
troops. to provide storage and ship
ping accommodations for every brunch
of the army service in New York ! ir
hor. to concentrate the ordnance build
ings, to rearranz:- the buildings on the
Island and to enlarge the island.
The board gave special attention to
the question of providing additional
area to Governors island by building
a sea wall exterior to the present wall
and filling In the water area. It was
considered that for the present pur
poses of the post the existing accomnto
dations are sufficient, but in view of
the great national importance of New
York harbor it was deemed advisable
that there should be at that point a
spacious government reservation, coat
venient to the city and adapted to
every military requirement. The con
templated improvements and enlarge
ment would make Governors island
the most Important military post on
the Atlantic coast and would transfer
to the Island practically all of the
transport shipping now done at Erie
basin, wvhich wautlti effect a great sav
ing of time and expense.
The beard found that Governors is
land is well suited to the project of
adding to its area by filling In the ad
joining shoal areas. "The low shoal,"
the report says. "forming that part of
Governors island and projecting from
its southern border and lying between
the two navigable channels of the up
per harbor, can be easily raised to
any desired height and utilized for
government purposes. The desired en
largement may be effected by inclos
ing a portion of the shoal by means
of solid timber dikes and filling it in
with excavations taken front the ad
jacent channels undergoing improve
ments by the United States. Should
more permanent improvements be de
sired at a later period. the subaqueous
part of the dikes may constitute a
foundation for stone sea walls. It is
edtimated that the filling In will cost
the government only a nominal sum,
as it is believed that the contractors
will be glad to avail themselves of a
dumping ground which would obviate
the necessity for a long towage to sea
of dredged material. A dike running
east and west across the shoal at a
distance of 300 feet from the sea wall,
together with marginal dikes, will
provide an enlargement of 15 acres,
and a dike 1,500 feet out will give an
ealargement of 70 acres. The Improve
ment which the board recommends as
the most desirable is an enlargement
by a dike located 2.000 feet from the
shore, which will provide an Increased
area of Dearly 90 acres. The dikes
which will form the east front and
seuth boundaries of the made land
will measure about 5.800 lIneal feet
sad may be put In position, it Is estI
mated, ftr the -e of $7?25,000 The -

the proposed improvement. According
to statistics for the year 1899, prepar
ed by Major W. L. Marshall of the
United States engineer corps. 33.143
steamers, sailing vessels, barges, etc..
arrived and departed from the port of
P*w York, representing 12,01,2W2 tons
burden, with an estimated valuation of
$373.754,512. It would seem to be wbe
t. spend as much for keeping open
the front gate of the nation's greatest
harbor as was spent upon the rear
entrance. Hell Gate. Whether the en
tire expense should be borne by the
general government is another matter.
At all events sa port with an annual
commerce of nearly $400,000,000 is
entitled to considerable consideration.
