The friends of Senator Mont
gomery have announced that he will
not be a candidate against Gover
nor Foster owing t. the indifference
which exists in North Louisiana.
It would seem from all appearances
that Governor Foster will have a
walk-over.
It strikes us that if the New
Orieans people would get rid
of the cases of corruption
already on the , docket rath
er than exert their energies to
ward the disclosure of other cases,
the cause of justice in the Crescent
City would be benefited. There is
altogether too much investigation.
Judge Hurt, of Texas, has de
cided that there is no law on the
statute books of the Lone Star State
to prevent prize fights, and it is now
a settled fact that Corbett and Fitz
simmons will pound each other at
Dallas in the latter part of October.
Poor Gov. Culberson is not in it
any more.
Every editor of a newspaper
thinks he has a hard time of it,
but the following clipped from a
Tennessee paper downs them all;
"We are mad! Darn the people!
How can they expect us, out here,
twelve miles from a railroad, twen
ty-five miles from a river, millions of
miles from heaven, about two miles
from the devil and about two hun
dred yards from a whiskey shop to
get out a lively newspaper ?"
The new jury law in California
has been on trial for some time,
and its novel provisions are re
ported to give general satisfaction.
It provides that in a criminal case,
when the district attorney thinks
the trial will be expedited, fourteen
jurymen instead of twelve may be
summoned and qualified. The ex
tra jurymen attend court regularly,
hear the evidence and arguments,
but they have no voice in the mat
ter of conviction or acquittal except
in the event of sickness or death of
one or more jurymen. In that case
one of the extra jurors is put in the
panel, anti the trial proceeds with
out interruption.-Pittsburg Post.
We don't always agree with The
Daily States; but it is ever with
genuine pleasure that we read its
editorials. They are based on
straight Democratic gospel. With
a few more such fearless expoun
ders of the real Jeffersonian article,
Louisiana would soon be freed from
its present political entanglement.
There is no comlpromise about The
States; it is clean-cut and straight
out from start to finish. It prefers
honorable defeat than victory
achieved through alliances with the
enemies. Like a good Democrat it
enjoys a square, open fight, with or
without gloves. It abhors skulking;
it is a brave and courageous fight
er, who inspires fear in the breast
of the enemy and commands the
respects of friend and foe alike.
MIay the old States live long and
prosper, for she is Democracy's
best friend in the Pelican State.
LET IT LEAR 17S SIL4RE.
It is to be hoped that the South
ern Pacific Company will do the
right thing by the cane planters this
year. Prices are so low, that if the
railroad company collect the same
charges as last year, it is question
able if the planters will have aniy
thing left after the payments of the
costs incurred by cultivation, cut
ting, loading, etc. \Wages of the
field hands have been reduced, the
price of cane has beetin much low
ered, in fact everybody conlnected
with the cultivation of caize and its
manufacture into sugar must be sat
isfied with a smaller profit. We be
lieve that it is only :imple justice that
the railroad company should bear
its share of the burden imposed by
low prices. VVe are aware that the
comnpany is put to considerable
trouble andt great expenditure of
money by the alauling of cane to the
refineries; but it is our firm convic
l ion that its earnings are sufficiently
L large to justify the planters in ask
wc. irg for a reduction of freight
i-chafges. If the laborer, the planter
.mad the mamrtfacturer can afford to
-,'ltgpt'les, why nhr.l'll the railroa,.i
not do the same? When prices
were good and the country was
prosperous the railroad enjoyed -its
share of that prosperity which it
had largely assisted in bringing!
about. It was entitled to a part of'
the "fat" andit got it. Now that
things hive changed; that the coun
try is suffering and the poor planter
is the principal victim of the hard
times, is it not meet that it be
called upon to do its best to lighten
the burden ?
ASTOUNrDING DISCOVER
IES.
After an undisturbed silence our
estimable contemporary, The Ad
vertiser, has awvakened from its
slumbers and has grown so pro
foundly aggressive that at times it
forgets the dignity of age and be
conies amusingly sensational. Our
esteemed neighbor has made some
astounding discoveries of late. HI-e
has made the discovery that these
many years the Democrats of Lafa
yette parish, with perhaps the ex
ception of himself and a few intense
ly independent and thoroughly dis
interested patriots, have been led
by three or four political dictators;
that they have allowed themselves
to be used as subserviant tools by a
handful of bosses, who have gotten
to be so powerful and arrogant
that cremation has been devised as
the safest and speediest means to
do away with them. Our good
friend has also revealed the exis
tence in this parish of a band of
reformers into whose hands alone
the affairs of this parish would be
safe. We suppose that some of
these reformers made their debut as
such, at the Falk's hall meeting.
They are no doubt very worthy
gentlemen and good fellows, but
for heaven's sake, Van, don't try to
pass them off as reformers. Any
thing else except that. Some of
them might turn out to be howling
successes in almost any line of
business, but as reformers never.
The people have tried them. They
had excellent chances to reform the
parish and municipal administra
tions and everybody knows what
brilliant reformers they have been.
That kind of reform will hardly
bears- repetition.
The Advertiser seems not to
know that there is in this parish a
regularly organized I)emocratic
party and it is simply conversing
through its hat when it says that
nominations have been made by a
few "'dictators" and not by the
majority of the Dem-crats. That
kind of political claptrap will
decieve no one acquainted with
the people of this parish, who are
too intelligent and too honorable to
be "dictated to," and we are reall)
surprised that The Advertiser
should make such a remarkable
assertion. Who ever heard of the
white men of Lafayette being led
by bosses. That kind of thing
might do with the negroes, but no
self-respecting white man will be
bulldozed or led in any way. If
there live such a person in this
parish we would like to see him;
he would indeed be a curiosity. It
has been our experience that the
white voters are as a rule men of
intelligence and honesty, who can
be depended upon in all emergen
cies. They have always been tirst
and foremost in the ranks of the
party and when it was necesssary
they asserted their supremacy over
a band of viciou: whit ~s and their
black allies. They were never
known to shirk a duty andl they are
not of the stuff o; which
po!itical slaves are made. We
appreciate the fact that cer
tain genilermen, who have so
renely bobbed up as reformers,
nmay have a grievance a ainst the
white people of this l)arish for
having voted them out of office, but
that is a natural feeling.
In its last editorial on the politi
cian s tuation The Advertiser
speaks of professional politicians.
etc. Against these much abused
persons The G;azette has nothing to
say; but it ill-becomes our friend
to warn the people against the
politicians, for some of the leading
members of the faction represented
by his paper are notliing if not
politicians. Shoull the peliplc fol
low his advice to be shy of the
politici ns, the "cm;ni/e ex'cIt:/: ,l

concerning the management of
Louisiana's finances that will be
startling to the enemies of the ad
ministration and that will prove to
be arguments more potent than any
idle words of praise that could be
bestowed, arguments unanswerable
to the minds of all lovers of wise or
good government.
At the beginning of this adminis
tration there were outstanding
$485,000 of past due unpaid cou
pons, every dollar of which has
been retired and provided for.
There were outstanding warrants
for i884, '85 and '86 amounting to
i340,ooo and this entire amount
has melted away under the present
administration.
There have been retired and paid
in full $512,0oo of interest bearing
State bonds maturing in 1914, thus
reducing annually $20,480 in inter
est alone which the State would
have had to pay and aggregating a
total saving in interest of about a
half million dollars.
To-day, there is not a dollar of
outstanding floating indebtedness of
the State since the year 1880.
" Since its induction into office the
administration has been on an ab
solutely cash basis, and to-day
every fund is amply provided for
and there is cash in the treasury
which will soon be applied to an
other retirement of the State's obli
gation.
As a result, State bonds are now
at practically par, and as soon as
the financiers of the world learn
that this condition of our State's
affairs is permanent and enduring,
when the pessimists of the State
and the envious and jealous kickers
and pullbacks shall be hushed, our
State obligations will command a
high premium on the common mar
kets of the world.-B. R. Truth.
B.A UREGARD AMOArNU 'ME
It is really a shame that the peo
ple of Louisiana have so far fa;led
to erect a monument to the memory
of their greatest soldier General
Beauregard. It is with much
pleasure that we publish the follow
ing order issued by the Major Gen
eral of the United Confederate
Veterans. It is an eloquent appeal
for aid to raise the balance of the
fund for General Beauregard's stat
Nirw (ORLEAxs, Sept. 16, 1895.
With Great satisfaction the Ma
jor General commanding announces
to the Louisiana division, United
IConfederate Veterans, the resumlp
tion by the Beauregard r Ioument
Association of active measures to
complete the fund it has been rais
ing for the statute to Louisiana's
greatest soldier and beloved son,
Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant de
Beauregard. The early completion
of this testimonial to his greatness,
of his enduring expression of his
soldier's and countrymen's admira
tion and love should be the aim of
every waririor of Louisiana's sol
diery, of every citizen of his native
State and city, of every true South
erner throughout the land. M onu
nients to Lee, to Jackson, to Albert
Sidney Johnson, already rear their
sculptured lines on Louisiana soil,
and the companionship that our
great captain held with them in
genius, in glory and in hearts of the
Southern people should not be so
long parted in its monumental form
in the mnother soil of the hero who
has cast so much renown on Louis
iana's name. The Major General
commandi, g therefore urges all
camps of the division. all supervis
ors of the Confederate armies, to
aid the Ieauregard Monument As
sociation in its patriotic mission,
and to do their part worthily in the
performance of the sacred duty they
owe their peerless General, their
gallant State, their heroic selves.
Gen. John Glynn, Jr., of New
Orleans, is treasurer of the assocai
tion and contributions should be
sent to hinm. By or :er of
W'. C;. irNCIEN'I, Major General.
