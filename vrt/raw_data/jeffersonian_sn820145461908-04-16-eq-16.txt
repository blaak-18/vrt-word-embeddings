WATCH THE DATE ON THE LABEL!
“Under the new postal regulations, weekly and monthly publications _ are
allowed a limited time to collect subscriptions, and they are not permitted to
carry the names of delinquent subscribers beyond a certain date.
“Our subscribers will help us greatly if they will keep an eye on the date
when their subscriptions expire, as shown by the labels; and by renewing at
or before expiration they will save us the trouble of calling their attention to
the fact.
“A postal card sent to a subscriber to notify him that his time is out is
not a dun; it is a gentle reminder that if he does not renew in a short time,
his name will be dropped from the mailing lists, in accordance with the law.
“Watch the date on the label!”
