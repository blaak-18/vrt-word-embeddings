OLD SOLDIER WRITES—NAMES
THE SLAUGHTERS OF
GEORGIA.
Franklin, Tenn., Sept. 7, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: While in prison at Rock
Island, 111., during the winter of ’63-
‘64 my bunk mate was a young Geor
gian named E. R. Slaughter, a son
of Dr. A. B. Slaughter, of Forsyth, or
Cuthbert, Ga. I have often thought
that I ought to try in some way to get
in touch with his people, for I felt
they would like to hear something of
him. lie was as fine a young man as
I ever knew. He was taken to the
hospital during the latter part of the
winter, where he died of smallpox.
I thought perhaps through one of
your Jeffersonians that this would
reach some one of the family, and
I will be glad if you will publish it.
Yours with best wishes,
J. K. MARSHALL, SR.
NO LATTER-DAY DEMOCRACY
FOR HIM.
Kissimmee, Fla., Sept. 15, 1908. -
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I was born in Schley
county. Georgia, August 9, 1859.
Therefore I voted my first time in the
fall of 1880. My father being a Dem
ocrat, of course I was a Democrat,
and, I must say, I am still a Demo
crat, but not of the latter-day kind.
How any man that doesn’t belong to
the moneyed class can follow the so
called Democrats is beyond my con
ception. There is not one thing that
they advocate which will help the
working class, and still we of the
South are expected to come up with
our 156 electoral votes to help to elect
Bryan, who has dropped his crown
of thorns and cross of gold, and has
gone, soul and body, in the gold-bug
camp. If he wanted to be president,
he ought to have stayed with the peo
ple.
The people must have relief from
the galling yoke that is bearing them
down, down, harder and harder every
year. With the gold-standard, na
tional banks, high tariff and railroad
and other monopolies all gathering
their tribute from the producing class
—and Bryan for all these —we must
look somewhere else for relief. I see
no chance for us in the two old par
ties, but I think the light is breaking
for us with Williams in the north and
west and the fearless Watson in the
south to rally the people to the stand
ard of equal rights to all men.
Things are going to come our way.
It may not be this year, it may not be
next year, but it’s coming, coming,
coming. Wishing you success, 1 re
main Your true friend,
G. B. WOODALL.
A WORD ON NATIONAL AND
STATE POLITICS.
Editor Jeffersonian: As to national
politics, permit us to say a word or
two. The situation is a peculiar one.
Mr. Bryan claims there is great har
mony in his party, which means his
election. Let us see. There are the
Debs Democrats, the Hearst Demo
crats and the Bryan Democrats, all
with a candidate in the field. Beauti
ful harmony! They have agreed to
.disagree. The controlling elements in
the Republican party are together, but
the rank and file are preparing to
shoot a regular scatter gun on elec
tion day, and who knows but that our
“Tom” may be our next president?
The farmers in Alliance days naet
in Ocala, Florida, and formulated the
Ocala platform—the greatest political
document of its kind in America, and
Watson indorsed it, though
not an Alliance man, and we
elected him and four others
pledged to stand by those princi
ples and have them enacted into law.
He is the only one who stood the test
and is still fighting for us. You see,
he is our flag bearer, and has planted
it upon the ramparts of the enemy,
and we are just following our flag,
boys. Why, that is just patriotism.
We had a funny state election,
didn’t we, though? But it was not so
funny after all to some. Maybe our
national election will be just as funny
to some others. Hope so.
Are you not reminded by the pres
ent state of national politics and the
efforts of national leaders of the state
of affairs that prevailed in the Tenth
Congressidtufl dis*'?* some years ago
when our brought to bear
so much’l;. ech making to
defeat Mr. ’ failed —had to
count him out? the national lead
ers are doing in Georgia today to de
feat Air. Watson, fearing what the fu
ture may have in store for them if he
carries the state.
The Hearst Democrats have put a
clever Georgian on the tail-end of
their ticket to catch us, but nay,
friend, the mask is too thin. Nor will
Brother Yancey Carter’s nomination
fool us. He ran in the Democratic
primary two years ago for sheriff of
Hart county and was defeated, but
will be worse defeated in the guber
natorial election.
Strange things have happened.
Yours truly,
B. F. LEE.
PEOPLE WAKING UP.
/
Pineview, Miss., Sep. 15, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: People are waking up
in this section, as never before, to
the need of a new party, if we are
ever to get our rights. They realize
that nothing can be expected of a
leader and party that changes so con
stantly as Bryan and the Democracy,
and von will get lots of votes in this
section from people who have never
voted anything but the old party tick
ets. The principles of the Farmers’
Union are making us think for our
selves, and as the Populist party is
the only one that is contending for
these principles, it seems to me that
a Union man who doesn’t vote the
Populist ticket hasn’t got any Union
blood in him, especially when it is
considered that you have stood un
flinchingly by your principles for
twenty years, while what Bryan
■©he 3e|Tersonian
hasn’t stood for in that time isn’t in
the book.
Bryan has been bragging on the
fact that this is the only State in
which he canned every precinct, but
after a visit through the southeastern
part of the State, I have come to the
conclusion that considerable starch
will be sweated out of his shirt when
he hears the Mississippi election re
turns when the Ides of November roll
around.
Yours for victory,
W. E. ATWOOD.
A RALLY FOR ALABAMA.
Owassa, Ala., Sept. 13, 1908.
Air. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga. -
Dear Sir: I am going to try and
have a rally in this county about the
middle of October. I have the prom
ise that Judge Longshore, from
Shelby county (Watson elector),
will come to this meeting and make
a speech. If you can possibly come,
you set the time and let me know,
and I will advertise it thoroughly. If
you could go to Alontgomery and Bir
mingham, and then come on down to
Evergreen, I am satisfied yon would
do a lot of good.
Let me hear from you, but I am
going to try and have this meeting
whether you come or not.
Yours to a finish,
Al. JOHNSTON.
IN THE CAUSE TO STAY.
Atoka, Tenn., Sep. 14, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Aon are our leader. We have all
confidence in you. Have our people
send up here in Tennessee some good
speakers in our cause, and let’s make
the fight of our lives. I am young in
the Populist cause, but I am there to
stay as long as we fight for the prin
ciples that you advocate.
JOHN W. CLARK.
THE HEARST GAME IN KEN
TUCKY.
Spottsville, Ky., Sept. 21, 190 S.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
Dear Sir: I enclose herewith a
card and blank petition from Nation
al Committeeman J. E. Merrick of the
Independence party. You will see on
the petition my name appears as an
elector from the Second district. At
the instance of Jo. A. Parker, I at
tended a conference in Louisville,
I think it was on the 10th of July in
v hich Populists and Independence
people took part. Mr. Parker
thought best and so advised a. joint
electoral ticket for Kentucky. We se
lected a ticket in which Populists pre
dominated. On the petition I only
note two Populists, myself and G. W.
Pipes.
The People’s Party is not men
tioned in the petition and it seems
to me the intention of the Independ
ence people to be to scoop the Popu
lists in Kentucky. I for one don’t
intend to be pulled, into that aggre
gation.
I write you to show what they are
doing in Kentucky and to ask what
is the best thing to do to preserve the
remnant of our party in the state,
Yours very truly,
L. R. GREEN.
Note: I hope that every true blue
Populist in Kentucky will let this
Hearst business alone. Fight shy of
the pay-roll crowd. It is an insult
to an old Pop to ask him to surren
der to the copyrighted party that be
longs to millionaire Hearst. —T. E. W.
WATSON WOULD LIKE TO GO.
Texarkana, Ark., Sept. 14, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Alv dear Sir: Oh that we could
have a Populist speaker in our midst!
Will it be possible for you to come
to Texarkana before the election? It
would do much good. I am doing,
and will continue to do, all I can for
you and the cause for which you long
have so ably struggled and which will
inevitably culminate in a glorious tri
umph.
If you can come to Arkansas, let
us know in time to get the good news
well advertised so that all may share
in the- good results of your visit.
Aly wife joins me, not in wishing
you success, but in congratulating you
upon the success which you have met
with already.
Ever for and with the cause,
J. Al. RAMSY,
INTERESTING ITEMS.
The average price of the American
potato last year was 61.7 cents a
bushel.
Boats engaged in mackerel fishing
off Alilford, England, have landed as
many as 30,000,000 fish, and a hun
dred fish have been sold for a shilling.
Up to 1906 Pennsylvania produced
more natural gas than she could make
use of, but now it is necessary to
draw upon the supply of West Vir
ginia.
Saskatchewan, Canada, will some
day be the greatest wheat-growing
country in the world, owing to the
peculiarly advantageous conditions of
its soil.
Two new electrical journals appear
ed recently about the same time bear
ing the same name. One comes from
New York and the other from Chicago,
The use of the gas engine on the
farm is growing more popular every
year. In the last tw T o years 50,000 of
these motors were purchased by farm
ers and the demand this year has
every indication of being greater.
England is a free trade country.
Germany is a. high tariff country. Yet
the wages paid workingmen in the
factories of England are much higher
than in Germany. Will some high
tariff advocate tell us just why this
is?—Custer County Beacon, Broken
