A - SCOTT
News Items Picked Up by the Gazette
Correspondent.
Mr. and Mrs. James Price and
children have moved among us to
stay. The people of Scott wel
come all good citizens. We hope
Mr. and Mrs. Price will be pleased
with our little town.
Mrs. John Stark, accompanied by
Henry Bourdier, were visitors in
Scott last Sunday.
Mr. J. Guidry made a business
trip to New Orleans purchasing a
large stock of goods.
Misses Ella Prekins and Mary
Price were in Lafayette during the
week.
Several drummers were on our
streets during the week doing
business.
While the storm last Sunday
night was furious, Scott escaped the
dangerous part. Only Dr. Guidry's
gig and one or two egg cases were
strewn across the streets. The far
mers can well do without rain or
wind at the present moment. It
seems as if the advance agent of
prosperity has failed in his predic
tions, and the opening of the g. o.
p. for '97 is anything but prosper
ous.
Scott was deserted on Friday
last. Every one going to Lafa
yette to try and get a sight of the
two murderers that swung into
eternity for one of the most
atrocious crimes of the century.
Mr. P. A. Delhomme is having
erected a large kitchen and dining
room near his large residence and
opera-house.
The man with the funny little
box and funny little numbers was
in town last Tuesday and some of
our people dropped a few diunes
getting no value in return.
Messrs. J. and P. have placed
themselves down to genuine hard
work and the cabbage, so Jim says,
are growing at the rate of two
inches per night. Folk will not
want for vegetables this present
season.
In the game of foot-ball the other
day, the list of cripples is not ex
tensive, but nevertheless large
enough. Sid all stoved up; Orton
two scratches on the left shin; Pre
jean, eye black and a slight scratch
over eye and thumb sprained;
young man from the country, arm
slightly sprained. By the use of
antiseptic they are all O. K. and
looking fresh. From the above it
can plainly be observed that Scott
is lively, and pastimes are getting
numerous. Every boy and man is
cultivating a set of large muscles.
All the cisterns in Scott were
filled by the last two hard rains,
with the exception of that of our
friend Doucet. It was incompre
hensible to him that he had not a
drop of water in his tank. Our
friend J. solved the problem by in
vestigating and finding no gutter
running from the house to the
cistern.
Several residences will go up in a
few days. That is what we need.
Places to rent. We do not believe
in letting land idle and not make a
cent profit on it. ORTON.
I carry the most complete line of
ladies' dress goods in town: Give
me a call, my prices are right and
goods likewise. Leon Plonsky.
It is said that Mr. Cleveland will
become the senior partner of Cleve
land, Carlisle & Stetson. Mr. Car
lisle and Mr. Stetson are already

Something to Know.
It may be worth something to
know that the very best medicine
for restoring the tired out nervous
system to a healthy vigor is Electric
Bitters. This medicine is purely
vegetable, acts by giving tone to
the nerve centers in the stomach,
gently stimulates the liver and kid
neys, and aids these organs in
throwing off impurities in the blood.
Electric Bitters improves the appe
tite, aids digestion, and is pro
nounced by those who have tried it
as the very best blood purifier and
nerve tonic. Try it. Sold for 5oc
or $r.oo per bottle at Wm. Clegg's
Sdrug store.
AN IDEAL STOE '
David Levy's Handsome Stricture
One of the Pinest in the
Country.
If you visit Rayne the first thing
that will meet your eye is a magni
cent structure on the eve of being
l completed. When finishl&_ and
filled with goods it will be one of
the handsomest and largest stores
in Southwest Louisiana. Upon in
quring of any resident of the thriv
ing little town you will be informed
that it is "Dave Levy's new store."
The readers of The Gazette have
all heard of and known Dave Levy,
the hustling and enterprising mer
chant, who opened the "Acadia
Cash Emporium" in Rayng in the
beginning of the year x887 and who
has gained much an enviable repu
tation-in the commnercial world.
Like all" intelligent business men
Mr. Levy is -an extensive ad
vertiset having spent a small fortune
with the- papers of Acadia and
neighboring parishes, and to the
power of printer's ink he attributes
his success
Although the building occupied
presently by Mr. Levy is one of the
largest in the town of Rayne its
capacity is inadequate to the volume
of business transacted and about
three months ago Mr. Levy con
trated with Messrs. A. C. Lewis &
Bro:, for the construction of a
building that would offer ample ac
commodation. The dimensions of
the new structure are 38x loo
feet. The front store-room is 14
feet high, 38 feet wide and 84 feet
in length. While in the rear there
is a ware-room i6 x 38. In the
center of the main apartment is a
very neatly constructed elevated
office with a stairway at each end.
The counters are unusually large,
two of them being each 24 feet in
length and two measuring 32 feet.
An idea can be had of the magni
tude of the main room when it is
known that the shelving consists of
192 feet. In the grocery depart
ment there are 12 wooden binns and
8 metalic self-closing binns.
The second story will be used
principally to keep stock. A ceil
ing 12 feet high and twenty win
dows make it a very pleasant and
airy place.
Mr. Levy will move into these
commodious" quarters during the
latter part of April.
Mr. Levy is aided by a corps of
gentlemanly and competent clerks.
Mr. A. C. Poulet is book-keeper and
Mr. William Martin assistant; the
salesmen are: Bennie Christman,
Max Sommers, Gustave Besse, Ed
Wimberly and Morvin Cunningham,
all affable and energetic young men.
Ladies' and gentlemen's fine um
brellas to be had at Leon Plonsky's.

LAFAYETTE TEACHiRS
Meet sfnd bDscuss Interesting
Subjects on Education.
LAVIAVETTE, La., March 27, '97.
-The Teachers' Parish Institute
met to-day in regular session with
the following members present: C.
A. Boudreaux, H. E. Toll, P. Mar
tin, Robert Broussard, F. Crepin,
W. G. Webb, R. B. Martin, C. F.
Trudeau, G. St. Julien, K. E.
Cunningham, G. H. Alnay, J. L.
Fletcher, F. R. Simmons, J. W.
Rutherford, Misses L. Mudd, V.
Younger, K. Rand and P. S. Greig.
The secretary-elect being absent
when the meeting opened, Miss
Greig was requested to hold the po
sition until her arrival
The disdussion of the subject as
signed for this meeting was opened
with the reading of a paper by Prof.
Philip Martin. Some of the impor
tant ideas brought forward in this
paper were: Patriotism and good
citizenship are the chief ends to be
attained by the teaching of history;
local and State history should be
taught; the text-book should be
supplemented with information by
the teacher. Many valuable sug
gestions were added by other
teachers. Among others were:
The teaching of current events; the
use of the newspaper in the school
room; the use of diagrams and pic
tures; the importance of combining
geography with history. The dis
cussion closed with a short address
by Prof. Trudeau. '"History," said
he, "is so vast, so unlimited a sub
ject, having its beginning with the
birth of time, each year increasing
its proportion by a manifold ratio
that the problem of crowding it, in
its entirety, into the child's mind in
so limited a period, has never yet
been solved and doubtless never
will be. All that we can possibly
do is to pick out, here and there,
those events and personages that,
by their prominence and striking
characteristics, rise high above the
common place, and to use them as
central figures around which to
group a nation's history; to arouse
and interest in these and cultivate
a spirit of investigation which will
continue long after the child has
left school."
The p.ogram for next meeting is
as follows:
I. Discussion of leading articles
on educational topics published
during month.
2. How to teach English-gram
mar, composition, spelling, etc.
3. How can music be taught in
the school-Foom.
4. Habit formation.
Miss Mudd declining to serve as
secretary and treasurer, Mr. Cun
