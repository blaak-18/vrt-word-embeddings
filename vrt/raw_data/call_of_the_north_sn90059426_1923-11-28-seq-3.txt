WHAT EVERY MASON
SHOULD KNOW
(Taken from Christian Science Moni
tor of Nov. 17, 1919)
In these days when the nation ap
pears to be turning with new inter
est to the faith of its founders, and
time-honored maxims and slogans
are once more coming into use, many
a reader of history, refreshing his
knowledge of the early struggle for
independence will, no doubt, come
upon the well known trial, “Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity,” without discov
ering in the early popular
ity of these words, to suggest ~a Ma
sonic relationship. Probably there
are even members of the Masonic or
der who have never concerned them
selves with such an implication. Yet
anyone, within or without the fra
ternity, taking the trouble to search
for facts, will very likely be sur
prised to find how generally the lead
ing men concerned in establishing the
United States as a Nation were Ma
sons. All the familiar historical in
cidents, when re-read in the light of
Masonic facts, assume a new inter
est, if not a new significance; “Paul
Revere’s Ride,” so well celebrated by
Longfellow’s verse, might be famous
likewise as a Masonic exploit. Not
only was Revere himself a Mason;
but so was Robert Newman, who
hung the signal lantern in the Old
Church, and so, also, wa3 William
Dawes, who gave the alarm Jjy way
of Roxbury, as Revere did by way of
Charlestown. James Otis, the Bos
tonian, whose "pamphlets inveighed
against the arbitrary measures of*
the crown and paved the way for rev
olution, and Patrick Henry, whose
eloquence in the Virginia House of
Burgesses helped to bring the South
to the support of the cause, were
Masons; so were Samuel Adams, Jo
seph Warren, and Josiah Quincy, who
joined with Otis and Revere in lay
ing plans for the Revolution at the
Green Dragon Inn. The famous Bos
ton Tea Party, according to the in
formation gathered by Madison C.
Peters, in preparing & little volume
on “Masons as Makers of America,”
was projected in' the residence of a
Mason, and its descent upon the ships
at T Wharf was led by members of
St. Andrews Lodge, headed by Paul
Revere, then one of its junior officers.
It is a matter of "fairly common
knowledge that Masonic names were
numberous amongst the signers of
the Declaration of Independence. As
a matter of fact, there were 66 sign
ers, and all but six were members of
the fraternity. The signer of the
completed document, formally repre
senting congressional action, was a
Mason, John' Hancock. Masons who
took a hand in drafting the Declara
tion were John Adams, Benjamin
PROTESTANTS GAVE
U. S. INDEPENDENCE
We read so much false propaganda
these days it is refreshing to learn
the truth now and then. Catholic
historian would have us believe the
Catholics gave to us our Constitu
tion and were the fathers of our laws
of religious freedom. They have
gone far enough to state on several
occasions that had it not been for the
loyal Catholics we would never have
had a free government in this coun
try. Let’s look into the records a
little and see to whom we owe our
ideals of government.
The Irish Roman Catholics, who
make so much fuss and write so
many books as to their part played
in the establishing of our nation, did
not begin to come over until after
the government was founded. The
Irish who did assist were all Protest
ants. At the time of the Revolution
nearly all the Irish here in America
were Protestants (so the records
show). Bunker Hill was named by
the Protestant Irish after Bunker
Hill just outside of Belfast, Ireland.
The Protestant Irish gave the name
of Londonderry to a town in New
Hampshire. Gen. John Stark, who
won the battle of Bennington, Ver
mont, was a Protestant Irishman.
The “Cradle of Liberty,” Fanueil
Hall, was named for a Protestant, a
French Huguenot. An Irish Protest
ant stands in the front rank of Rev
olutionary heroes and was three times
governor of New Hampshire—John
Sullivan.
A Protestant Irishman settled and
named Ulster county, New York; he
was the father of Gov. George Clin
ton. Practically all the Irish in West
Virginia were Protestants, as was
western North Carolina. The popula
tion of South Carolina was solidly
Scotch-Irkh Protestants. Kentucky
and Tennessee were populated almost
entirely by Scotcb-Irish Protestants.
Protestants in Mecklenburg, North
\ <
In Memory of
“Jack (ass) Walton"
4* '
Franklin, Roger Sherman of Connect
ticut, and Robert Livingston. Some
say that Thomas Jefferson, also a
member of this committee, was like
wise a Mason. Certainly Richard
Henry Lee was. He drew up the pre
liminary resolutions on independence.
And Masons largely composed the
convention which met at Charlotte,
N. C„ in May, 1775, to prepare the
so-called Mecklenburg Declaration of
Independence on lines similar to those
followed later in tKe principal decla
ration. With such a showing in the
preliminaries of national experience,
Masonic particulation was only to be
expected in the actual inception of
government. It is not surprising,
therefore, to find that 50 Masons sat
in the Constitutional Convention in
a total membership of 65; or that
Masons and Masonic paraphernalia
played an important part in the in
auguration of the first President,
himself a member of the order. Or,
even, that the governors of all the
thirteen states at that time were
similarly distinguished.
Perhaps the most striking preva
lence of Masonry, however, was in
the -personnel of Washington’s army.
Of his 29 major generals, 20 were
Masons. That their pledges of fra
ternal support might have counted
heavily to his benefit in the trying
days that were to come can, perhaps,
be inferred from the fact that ef the
non-Masonic major generals, one was
-Lee, notorious for his Monmouth
failure; another was Gates, who con
stantly plotted to undermine and sup
plant the commadder-in-chief; the
third was Conway, of The inafmous
Conway cabal; and the fourth, Thom
as Mifflin, whose negligence as in
spector of the army made his dis
missal necessary. In the whole list
of Washington’s brigadier generals,
numbering over 61, Stephen Moylan
was without Masonic degrees. Many
Masons gave distinguished service.
There was Ethan Allen of Ticonde
roga fame; Capt. Corcoran of Allen’s
Green Mountain boys; Col. William
Barton, capturer of Gen. Prescott of
the King’s forces; and Henderson,
the hero of Harlem Heights, who,
captured by the British, was paroled
through the interposition of a Ma
sonic brother, Robert Morris, the
financier of the Revolution, was a
Mason; so was a Polish Jew named
Haym Solomon, a Philadelphian, who
is said £2 have given upward of
$650,000 to the support of America
in the great struggle. John Mar
shall, Alexander Hamilton, and James
Madison, all were Masons. It is a
record that may well lead members
of tKe order to look to their laurels.
Carolina, on the 20th of may, 1775,
first asserted Americans to be free
and independent people.
The Declaration of Independence,
given to us in 1776, was signed by
14 Irish Protestants. These are the
Irish Rome talks so much about but
she fails to tell us they were Protest
ant. From their story you would be
lieve—or rather they word their
books so as to lead you to believe—
they were Catholics. Bear in mind
there was only one Roman Catholic
who signed the Declaration of Inde
pendence—Charles Carroll by name.
He, together with Benjamin Frank
lin, were sent up into Canada among
the French Catholics in the ' dark,
dismal days of the Revolution, seek
ing aid, and the 'Catholics
him down. If you remember history
you will understand why the Con
tinental Congress had passed a reso
lution condemning the Pope for his
nefarious acts. This, possibly, had
some bearing on the case.
The Declaration of Independence is
in the handwriting of a Protestant,
Charles Thompson. It was first
printed by an Irish Protestant, Capt.
Thomas Dunlap. It was first read to
the people by another Irish Protest
ant/Capt. John Nixon. Thirty-nine
general officers in the Continental
Army were Irish Protestants. The
hero of Stony Point, CoL Anthony
Wayne, and Col. John -Edgar How
ard, the hero of the Cow Pens, were
both Protestant Irish, a? was also
Col. William Campbell of Virginia,
who Won the Battle of King’s Moun
tain with Scotch-Irish volunteers.
Capt. Daniel Morgan, Gen. Thomas
Forrest, Daniel Boone, Gen. Sam
Houston and George Roberts Clarke
were all Protestant Irish.
Until the police forces of the va
rious cities were oiganized, Irish
Catholics did not come over in any
great numbers.—“ Dawn.”
r Th* CALL OF THE NORTH
THEAMERIOANLEGION
’ r .BY SANBALIAT
I hold that any man who registered
for war, and stood ready to go to
Europe, or anywhere else, for Amer
ica, WHETHER OR NOT THAT
MAN WAS CALLED UPON TO DO
SO—MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN
HIS PATRIOTISM.
There are some men who got into
a uniform, and went straight into the
jaws of hell-and death, because they
stood for the principles - that make
America' great, and out of the jawr
of death, such came back, and WE
RESPECT THEM.
There were some men who never
got further than a mule corral, in
some section of the country distant
from their home, and all they learned
about wgr was how to curry and cuss
mules, and WE RESPECT THEM.
Some men went to encampment,
and then over seas, and then into
the trenches, and then over the top,
and then into the jaws of death, and
then—“WESTWARD HOI” and WE
RESPECT THEM.
No matter what their color, not
what their creed, they were Amer
icans, and as Klansmeh,, WE RES
PECT THEM.
No matter whether born in this
country, or naturalized citizens, they
were Americans, and they proved it,
and all such WE RESPECT, because
we are Klansmero, and because we
love America and Americans.
There is no man, who when the
time came for the testing, and who
did his part, no matter how small,
but what WE RESPECT HIM. '
We Respect the American Legion
We respect the American Legion,
because it is made up of all sorts of
men, who are Americans.
We respect the American Legion,
because in convehtion assembled it
DID NOT ENDORSE THE KLAN.
There is no more reason that it
should endorse the Klan than it
should endorse any other secret fra
ternal organization.
We respect the American Legion,
because on that same occasion it did
not condemn the Klan. THERE IS
NO MORE REASON FOR THE
AMERICAN LEGION CONDEMN
ING THE KLAN THAN THERE
IS FOR IT TO CONDEMN ANY
OTHER SECRET, FRATERNAL
ORGANIZATION.
We respect” the American Legion,
because on that same occasion it
adopted a resolution, which reads:
“Whereas, membership in the
American Legion made up of those
who served our country in time of
great n tional stress without dis
tinction as to race, color, creed or
class; and
“Whereas, the American Legion is
pledged to the orderly enforcement
of our laws through lawful agencies;
therefore, be it
“Resolved by the American Legion
in national convention assembled this
17th day of October, 1923, that we
consider any individual, group or in
dividuals or organization which crem
ates, or fosters racial, religious or
class strife among our people, or
which takes into their own hands the
enforcement of the law, determination
of guilt or infliction of punishment to
be un-American, a menace to our
fundamental law; and, be it further
“Resolved, that we consider such
action by any individual, groups or
organizations to be inconsistent with
the ideals and purposes of the Amer
ican -Legion.”
Because the Legion stands for just
the same things as advocated by the
Klan for eight years, the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan stand on the same
high ground that the Legion has
taken by resolution.
More Respects
But there are more respects that
we wish to pay, beside those to the!
men who answered America’s call—
in their hearts.
Those are to the men who have
gone off half cocked, and havdT with
out trying to learn the truth, drawn
an incimtnet against the Ku Klux
Klan.
So —if there were among those
hosts of the American Legion in con
vention, men who voted for those
resolutions, who had in their mine!
that there were a charge- the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan was
doing the things that the resolution
condemned, for such men we have
the most thorough contempt, and
charge them with being hypocritical
liars and dastards, and to be men
who do not know the truth, who do
not want to know the truth.
The Klan was not organized to
take law into its own hands, not to
set creed against creed, nor raee
against race, however false and
treacherous self-seeking demagogues
have tried to make it so appear.
The slightest investigaton on the
part of anyone would prove that the
Klan is really the one groat agency
that stands for the best interests of
all men, and for the rights and guar
antees of all men, under the Consti
tution.
Hope It Is Plain
This writer hopes that it’s perfect
ly plain to all, no matter who they
are, whether they be the most prom
inent preacher In his own town, or
the weakest preacher in a small
town; whether it be the greatest
hero belonging to the American Le
gion, or the humblest mule skinner
of Uncle Sand’s army, who is now in
the Legion, that men who will indict
an organization in the unfair and
un-American manner as described
above, even IF IT IS ONLY IN
THEIR OWN HEARTS. There is no
excuse, for such paltry conduct, when
the slightest investigation in almost
any direction proves that the Klan
is a highly patriotic organization of
the best people.
All Alike
It makes no difference to us who
the person is, or however exalted his
when we read a speech that
casts calumny and abuse on the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan our
blood boils with righteous indigna
tion, and we naturally turn to char
acterize the speaker for what he ac
tually is.
At one time the president of the
United States, seemed to this writer
to be casting stones by innuendo and
suggesion, at our beloved order, and
this writer IMMEDIATELY CRITI
CISED HIM_FOR HIS FALSE AT
TITUDE. We cared not for his per
son, if perchance he meant the Klan,
because falsehood is falsehood, wheth
er circulated by the President or the
street sweeper.
At one time the President was re
ported as having sent, a telegram
felicitating the Knights of Columbus.
We immediately criticised him and
castigated him for what we thought
was the unwisest of conduct.
The governor of Texas, after he
had played politics through a cam
paign, and assured himself, that he
had been re-elected, took a dirty un
derhanded fling at the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan, and we did not hesi
tate to call his hand, and to tell him
that he was the cheapest sort of a
politician. " -
Many other lesser lights have done
the same, only to discover that wher
ever this paper circulates, and it cir
culates far and wide, their false and
cowardly conduct .has been heralded.
When members of the American
Legion, in the midst of the people,
where this writer’s influence is felt,
have attempted to ride into office by
throwing mud on our beloved order,
this writer has done his very best to
prevent their election, and in most
cases, has seen them defeated BE
CAUSE HE HAS TOLD THE
TRUTH ABOUT THEM.
There la No Difference
We take the ground that there is
no difference. We know the Klan
inside. We know for what it stands,
and WHENEVER ANY PERSON,
MAN OR WOMAN, HIGH OR LOW,
HAS LIED AND FALSIFIED
AGAINST THE- KLAN, BY SUG
GESTION, INNUENDO OR BY DI
RECT ACCUSATION, IN CHARG
ING IT WITH ANY OF THE MANY
GRAVE CRIMES AGAINST THE
CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS
OF THE COUNTRY, THE STATE
OR THE CITY, WE- HAVE BEEN
PROMPT TO DENOUNCE THEM.
It makes no difference whether
those persons have been the greatest
fn the community or the country, or
the very lowest. Priest or prelate,
President or dogcatcher—it makes no
difference, all who lie against the
Klan must expect the sharpest and
most caustice criticism from this
writer. He refuses to permit his
great secret order from being made
the object of unjust calumny and at
tack, unresented.
Liars and Dastards
We know a liar when we see‘one.
A dastard cannot hide from ns.
There is no respect of persons with
us. AH are alike who traduce the
good name of the Klan. Talk about
my splendid secret organization, and
treat it ill, and you have talked about
and treated me iU. Talk about it at
your peril, if you fear for a verbal
castigation of your hide. *We cannot
love the Klan as we do, and know
ing it from the inside as we do, and
mince wo ds in telling all who lie
against it that they are liars, and
that the truth is not in them.
Tha ' inended for all—from the
highest to the lowest, no matter
whether found in the American Le
gion, or in the President’s cabinet.

BAR ASSOCIATION
PLACES OKEH ON THE
PRINCIPLES OF KLAN
-K-K-K
ATTORNEYS WOULD "CREATE
ANEW THE PROPER SPIRIT
PATRIOTISM” §
—K-K-K
Detroit, Mich.—That the princi'
pies of the Ku Klux Klan have been
indorsed by the American Bar Asso
ciation and the Detroit Bar . Associa
tion, has become known here follow
ing the appointing of a committee
on American citizenship by the local
association upon the request of the
former.* Twelve local attorneys are
to serve upon the committee.
"It has become painfully apparent
that anti-American propaganda, at
tacks Upon our preju
dice against courts,' indifference of
our people to the duties of citizen
ship now prevailing,” declares W.
Millis, preseident of the association
in a letter to the committee, "all
call for the need of activity not only
to meet any passing and incidenal
adverse movement in the above di
rection that may become apparent,
but to engage in a sustained and in
telligent effort to combat unwhole
some influences, and to counteract
the same by creating a new and
maintaining a proper spirit of pa
triotism and obedience to law.”
Newspapers Will Squirm
The fact that the bar association
so strongly declares its belief in the
principles of the Ku Klux Klan will
place certain newspapers in Deroit
in a most peculiar position. These
dailies have .been making every ef
fort to impress upon the minds of
their readers that the Klan is not
law-abiding and that its members
are but p "gang of irresponsibles,”
will now have a hard time explain
ing away the fact that the American
Bar Association now advocates the
very things the Klan stands for and
that the local association stands
back of and endorses the Klan prin
ciples. -
Continuing, the letter by President
Millis reads: "It seems peculiarly
fitting that the members of the bar
should by their united efforts meet
and combat the challenges to our
American government and American
ideals.’*
The Ku Klux Klan is battling with
every ounce of its strength to main
tain American ideals and to know
that the American Bar Association
is bent on helping in this great un
dertaking gives added strength to its
efforts. Never before have the* in
stitutions of America been so men
aced as they are at this time; aliem
propaganda fills the newspapers as
those insidious influences at work to
destroy Protestantism and American
ism labor through channels of chi
canery in their unholy efforts to up
root and leave to decay the ideals
upon •which America, the greatest
and grandest country the world has
ever known, was founded by those
seeking freedom of. thought and re
lease from ancient dogmas and su
perstitions.
To Furnish Literature
Among the literature which, ac
cording to the letter to the commit
tee, will be furnished the local as
sociation by the national body, is in
formation in detail on the subjects
of “Law requiring the teaching of
the Constitution,” Celebration of na
tional holidays,” and. articles pertain
ing to press publidty, community
programs, etc.
“I am confident,” says Mr. Millis
in his communication, “that the com
mittee named can and will render an '
important and far-reaching service
to our city and the country at large,
by the intelligent effort that they will
bestow upon this most vital subject.”
That the bar association endorses
the principles of the Klan is seen
and emphasized by the paragraph
following the above in which Mr.
Millis expresses his confidence that
the committee will work in general
in harmony with the plans of any
program worked out by the Ameri
can Bar Association, to the end that
the rising generation will be given
help to acquire a “proper knowledge
of our government and patriotic sen
timents and beliefs that are so es
sential to citizenship.”
The endorsement of Klan princi
ples by the bar association wiU no
doubt be a blow to those who are
fighting the Klan and the newspa
pers that will have to camouflage

IDEALS OF JESUS MUST

HOMES OF AMERICA
—K-K-K
Flag and Bible Should be Placed Side
by Side, Declares Rev. P. H.
Packard, In Missouri
Address
—K-K-K—
--(Kansas City, Mo., Star.)
"The old-time wholesome Ameri
can home life and home training must
be restored, and the Bible must have
a place side by side with the Ameri
can Flag in our public schools, if we
would stem the moral and economic
crisis which -imperils our country to
day.”
This was the declaration of the
Rev. Paul Henry Packard, of Des
Moineq, lowa, who spoke at an evan
gelistic service at the Hyde Park
Christian church.
"The ideals of Jesus must be put
back into the homes of America,” de
clared Mr. Packard, in blaming lack
of home training and too little knowl
edge of the Bible for the immorality
and social unrest of the present day.
“The Bible is barred from the pub
lic schools in at least twelve'of our
states,” continued the evangelist. "In
many cases anti-religious doctrines
STe replacing the Bible.
Gives a Chicago Catechism
"In Chicago twelve thousand boys
and girls attend an anti-religious
Sunday school each Sunday after
noon.
"Here is the catechism they, are
taught to believe:
What is God?
God iff a word used to designate an
imaginary being which church people
have themselves devised.
How did man originate?
Just as did all the animals of the
field by evolution from a lower kind.
Has man any mortal soul such as
Christianity teaches?
Man has no soul; it is only an
imagination.
Is it true that God has ever been re
vealed?
As there is no God, He could never
be revealed.
What is heaven?
Heaven is an imaginary place which
the churches have devised as a charm
to entice believers.
Who is Jesus Christ?
There is no God, and there can
therefore be no Son of God.
Will Christ return on the judge
ment day?
There is no judgement day; that is
all a fable, so preachers can scare the
people and hold them in their grasp.
Man has no soul, neither had Christ
a soul; all these things have been in
ctnted by the churches.
Do we owe duty to God?
There is no God, and, therefore, we
owe Him no duty.
What is our duty when we have
learned there is no God?
We should teach this knowledge to
all whom we meet.
Is Christianity desirable?
Christianity is not desirable, be
cause it makes us spiritual cripples.
What is our duty when we have
learned that Christianity is not de
sirable ? '
It becomes our duty to help eradi
cate Christianity from the United
States.
Bible Needed For The Young
“These doctrines are being taught
by a radical element in many of the
cities of the country,” declared Mr.
Packard. “To counteract these teach
ings, we should give our boys and
girls the Bible teachings which wHI
make them good citizens.
“There are at present more di
vorces in a single year in the United
States than Canada has had in seven
ty-five years; three and a half million
dollars is being spent every day to
suppress crime in this country. The
only remedy for these conditions is
the Bible.
“In Oregon there is a law that pro
vides every child of school age shall
be educated in an American public
school. That law safeguards Ameri
can life and traditions. We need just
such a statute in every one of our
states.
“Parents should take more interest
in the welfare of their children, and
there should be more of the old-time
family attendance at church.”

Of the deed so Jrindly fine.
Why do papers hate the Klan?
No I’m not a brother Klan,
Merely just'an outside man,
Who would like to understand
Why the papers won’t be fair—
Give the Klan its honest share
Of the praise when its plays square.
