A HOME BY THE SEA.
"Oh! give me a home by the sea.
Where the wild waves are crested with
foam."
Was the song that I sang so joyounly,
In the light of my childhool home.
For the mountains were shutting us in.
And the hills were on every side.
And we could not see where the days begin.
Nor be sure it the world be wide.
But I smiled to my mother's smile,
And I laughed at my sister's words.
And the rippling brook I could hear, the whlle,
And the note of the summer birds.
As I sang the song that was sweet to me:
I "Oh, give me a home by the hearing sea:"
"Oh I give me a home by the sea.
Where the wild waves are crested with
foam."
Was the song that I sang all merrily.
As I went from my mountain home.
Did I think of the wild bird's song?
Did I think of the sunset's hue?
Did I think of the hearts that had loved me
long,
As I bade them a joyous adieu?
Did I look at the pictured hills,
And the emerald vales between?
Did I dream of the faithful love that fills
All the years that intervene?
Yes, but I longed away to he
I Over the hills and beside the sea.
"Oh! give me a home by the sea!"
Do I sing the song to-night.
When the waves are echoing close to me.
And the billows are full in sight?
I can see the white-winged ships
That backward and forward go.
But my longing memory backward slips
To the place where the pine trees grow.
I can see the wild waves' foam,
Hut I whispered all the while:
"Oh. for a sight of the mountain home.
And the light of nysister's smile:"
And 1 long for the days that used to be.
And sing no more of the fo::ming seaL
"Oh! give me a home by the sea:"
Let me sing it ag.ilt to-day.
A home-I know not where it will boe
Nor how I shall tin 1 the way.
But I know that a sea is there:
And 1 know ther ,'s a sea between:
And I know that the banks are forever fair;
And I know that the trees are green.
I am glad that the bills arise.
In the country where I shall go.,
That a valley of peace besid- them lies
And a river runs below.
The hindis of my ow.i, they are reaching for
me-
Oh. give me a home by the crystal sea:

PRISONERS OF WAR.
A Cenltury Ago Tile-se, Llforitunnuates Were
i'rutntluy Treated.
Little mnore than a century ago pris
oners nof war were treated wvith sys
tematic brutality. That gave .ohn
HIoward his first task. Providence
made him a sufferer in his own per
son, and thus pinted out time special
field in which his philanthropic inm
pulses were to find elnploynment.
Howar;lld's pity was roused by the tales
of wretchedness lie heard from Lisbon
after tie great earthqutake. lie took
pan.ssage on the Hanover brig, with the
intention simply of helpinig those nun
fortnuantes. int the Hanover was
captured by a privateer, which carried
it- prizes into lBrest. Forty
hours the crew, with !lowar-l,
lay in the bare and stilling
hold. A bi-~cuit each uwas thrown to
t-hern befonre tie hatches were closed,
buit no drop of water did they receive.
On arrival at Imrest no one heeded their
cries. They were thrust into n doun
geon unadergronllnl, damp adn fillthy
icvyonnd description. and "s:everal
hours" passed before the goalers
brought food or drink. Openin rg the
door then, they atitntally "pitched" a

scramnbled for, and torn to pieces with

C.-TGHING LIVELY BURGALLS.
They Are Not Very Ji3w. but Will rurnish
Lots of Amusessent.
Tine burgalls, or canners, asthe Con*
necticut fi),ermen call them, are enm
mnonly considered a nuisance. Tnhe,;
steal the bait from tihe books of bass
and blaclkfish anglers, and.some claim.
drive away the larger fish. But of
late certain knowing anglers have di
covered that, properly handled, the
burgalls will furnish great fun. They
are a plump, active little fish, seldomn
attaining a weight of more than a
pound and a half, and averaging about
half a pound. Their coloring is very
beautiful, showing in different lights
all the rainbow tints. They are gre
garious, and where one bites you may
know that a whole shoal is feeding.
Rocky bottom, with plenty of rock
weed and sea moss growth. is their
natural habitat, and they feed greedi
ly on hard or soft clams, crab meat,
bits of shiner and killie, cut up, and
.and vorms.
Of course, a heavy tackle clestroys
all the pleasure of catching these
plucky little inhk. You want a light
trout rod. a fine silk line, and snelled
sporat hooks, size No. 4 or 5, about
tie size used to take inountain brook
trout. A split buckshot will be a
Iheavy enough sinker to answer every
purpose. Ulit as carelessly as you
may, you ill1 not alarm or disgust the
burgall. lie is a fish of no epicurean
t::ste., and quantity stands before
quality in his eyes. l'ut a bit of bait
on just large enough to cover the bend
of tie hook. and let one end hang off
to tempt the rascals. Fish from a boat,
or froml a ledge of rocks, or fromn a
pier, and select a spot where the title
does not set, too sharply, for these fel
lows are too lazy to battle with very
strong tides.
Soon a quick mincing nibble will an
nounce the t-rst arrived guest. and a
lsharp, strong pull is necessary to hook
him. Thlese fish have hard, tough
jaws and lips, and gentle pulls will
never strike the barb home. Some
timnes the bigger ones, by running un
der a strongly-rooted clump of rock
wreed or sea kale, or under a bowlder
on tihe bottom, will give you great
trouble. At no time will they surren
ler without a very considerable tussle
for freedom.
.1 ust before a storm is the very best
time to catch nurgalls. When the sky
is black, and the heavy clouds hang
low over tile water, and the sea. gulls
.kin wildly over thie bay, the sturdy
roekdwellers legin to revel. At such
a tiume. with two hooks on your line.
you can land twov at a time until your
artm aches fromn tihe effort. The dead.
low water anlL rising tide are best for
catching lurgalls, for, by the time tihe
ebb sets out, these little gluttons have
so surfeited themselves oni tie flood
that they have no appetite left.
They are easy to catch, and can be
found all around New York hiarbor
ant adjacent water. Barstow-on-the
sound is a convetnient station on the
Hlarlem river branch of the New Haven
r:; illroad, and there you can take a lit
tle bobtail car to City Island. tHere
you catch burgalls nunnumlbered in
rocky 'Pelhanm bay and its many inlets.
no, too, you can along tihe Staten
island shore and on the .Jersey side.
W\hat is inn!'nre, after you Iave had tihe
fun of catching them tnhere still re
inains no inconsiderable treat, for the
bInrganlls, w\hen fre'sh caught, are the
linest pan fish that swim.n The mnan

WATER POWER.
Annerirnen a.nd Europennn Itetlhods of Using
It In a Lanrge Wany.
'Thie standard Amuerican niethod of
utilizing a large amount of water pow
er has hitherto been to distribute the
water to the several consumers or mill
owners by means of a system of Ihend
races, so ctlled, with facilities for its
discharge at, a lower level, to be util
ized as the ow ner orlessee sew fit, and
genterall3y on his own premircs. This
led to long mIead canals, and to insikr
ni 'ilen nt ta il -ra ces, wherea.s the Niagara
plant consists of a commollln tail-r-a'ne, a
nile and a halm f lhng,with comparative
ly in..tinificant hca:d-races. ''ITie old
time wnater power company selt or
lensed the right to draw a definite
quantity of water at defined times,
with tihe privil'ege of discharging it at
a lo\wer level, and the mill owner did
the rest; whllereas at Niagara falls tine
rigihtl. is leased to discharge a. definite
ijuantit of water into the tail-race
