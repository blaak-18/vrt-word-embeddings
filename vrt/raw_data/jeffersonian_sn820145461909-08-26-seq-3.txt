The Taking of Laurella
By Grace McGowan Cooke
THE TAKING OF LAURELLA.
“Please leave them thar dishes
alone, Laurelly, and come and set
down.”
“Did you want to talk to me?”
The girl turned a face of lovely
surprise over her shoulder as she
gave a great yellow bowl an extra
vigorous shove back upon the high
shelf.
Did he want to talk to her? Her
lover looked at her in helpless irri
tation. This was the history of their
courtship; when he met her at quar
terly or grove meetings he fancied
that if he were alone with her he
might make headway. When they
had the great kitchen all to them
selves, as tonight, with the fire
light making gusty shadow and
shine upon its crannied walls, he
found that she slipped through his
fingers like a mist-wreath or a moon
beam, and evaded his ardor by not
recognizing it.
“ ’Course I want to talk to you.
What do you reckon I come all the
way over from the Fur Cove fer?”
“I didn’t know. I was a won
derin’. I thought maybe you wanted
to see pappy or the boys.”
The attitude of the mountain girl
toward men and matrimony is primi
tive. She is not seeking the one nor
admiring the other. She animadverts
upon characteristics purely masculine
as defects. Masculine size she pro
fesses to consider clumsiness; a bass
voice is a “great coarse, rough
voice.” When she is finally wed, the
countryside is to understand that it
is an event which never entered into
her calculations, which has been ac
complished only by surprise and su
perior force.
Jason Bushares sat, hypnotized,
watching how the firelight ran up
Laurella’s white throat, lingering in
her eyelashes, throwing their sha
dow upward, adding an extra touch
of surprised inquiry to her coun
tenance, as she faced him and pro
fessed herself ready to hear the busi
ness upon which he had come. But
was she? Would she listen?
“Don’t you remember, Daurelly,
when you an’ me used to go to the
hollerin’ school together, an’ I was
always a writin’ notes to you, just as
soon as I learned how to write—or
print, ruther? ’
“Aw, law! Them days!” laughed
Laurella with heightened color, ig
noring the significance of his speech.
“Didn’t the teacher have big feet?
I’ve studied about his feet many a
time since, when I ought to have been
thinkin’ of somethin’ sensible. Has
your ma put in any o’ them dice
pattern counterpanes for to weave,
Jason?”
The fate of nations might have
hung upon Mother Bushares’ weav
ing, if one could judge by the girl’s
face; but Jason ignored the ques
tion.
“Don’t you remember, when I
went down to Garyville and got me
a job on the railroad, how I sent you
a vollentine?” he pursued.
“No!” the *tirl cried, with spark
ling eyes. “Was it a comic?”
"You know hit wasn’t. My name
was an it, an’ it said —it said —”
Jason floundered helplessly before
those laughing eyes. He sought des
perately in his mind for the exact
words that had been in the valen
tine—they would have served his
purpose well.
“Seems to me I do mind about a
right pretty vollentine that had a
name wrote so scratchy on it I
couldn’t tell who ’twas sent it. I
jes’ made it up in my own mind it
was Bob Provine—he’s always up to
such foolishness—an’ let it go at
that. Did your folks put up as much
meat as usual this fall? Looks like
our hogs never would fatten an’
pappy won’t kill till they’re jes’ so.”
‘Yes,” choked Jason, “we killed
1? ,t week. I guess we’ve got ruther
more than usual—er perhaps con
siderable less.”
The girl giggled.
“You ain’t thinkin’ a word about
what you’re sayin’,” she commented
softly.
“I’m a thinkin’ about somethin’ I
want to say,” Jason burst out, and
would have gone further; but the
girl rose hastily.
“Well, this’ll never do me,” she
began. “Es you don’t mind, I guess
I’ll weave a spell. I promised mam
my I’d finish the jeans for Homer’s
coat.”
Cruel Laurella! Tall and fresh
and fair, pink and white as the moun
tain laurel for which she was named,
she had already woven a spell; and
Jason could not utter the rebellion
that was in him, as she seated her
self at the loom whose whirr and
bang would be a ready reason for
failing to hear anything that she
chose not to recognize.
And so for half an hour the tor
mented swain stood at her shoulder.
“Laurelly, I jes’ want you to listen
a minute.”
“All right, Jason, you holler right
good an’ loud, an’ I can hear you
even w r hen the loom’s a goin,.”
But what man ever desired to
“holler” such speeches right good
and loud? Besides, if he did so his
shouts would be audible in the loft
above, where the boys slept, and in
the room across the open porch,
where the parents and the younger
children were.
Finally Laurella’s weaving came to
an end, because she lacked a darn
ing-needle to pull out an unwelcome
knot. Jason was standing threaten
ingly close.
“You jest get me that there poke
off of the high shelf, will you?” she
asked, turning coquettishly over her
shoulder.
“ ’Tain’t here.”
“Oh, yes, ’tis—all eyes an’ no
eyes—hit’s right beside the yaller
bowl. No—no! Don’t take the yal
ler bowl down! You, Jate Bushares
—l’ll never speak to you again!”
But she was too late. She sprang
up and ran across the room to where
Jason Bushares set the yellow bowl
upon the table, tilted it over, and
emptied out all her girlish treasures:
the little smudgy printed letter he
had first written to her, on a dog
eared fly-leaf of his second reader;
the “vollentine” she had laughed
about and denied knowledge of; a
Jeffersonian
tintype taken at Garyville, and pen
ciled across in her handwriting, “My
own true love.”
This last item settled it.
“Ye said ye wouldn’t have that
picture,” Jason murmured, as he
caught her in his arms and held her
fast. “Ye said it was too ugly. Ye
said ye was jes’ carryin’ it home to
give to your brother.”
Laurella looked up with blue eyes
drowned in tears, thus permitting the
enemy an advantage which he was
not slow in taking.
“What do you expect a girl to do?”
she finally murmured gently.
“Why, jest like you did,” answer
ed her lover happily. “I wouldn’t
have a single hair o’ your head
changed—now I’ve got ye at last!”—
Munsey’s.
This is the way some people would
run a newspaper: When a good man
goes astray—keep it out. When a
critic roasts a play—keep it out.
When two men in anger clash, when
a merchant goes to smash, when a
cashier steals the cash —keep it out.
When they quarrel in the church—
keep it out. When the teacher wields
the birch —keep it out. When nine
women, fair to see, whisper some
thing over tea —print it? Goodness
gracious me! —keep it out. When
two statesmen make a deal —keep it
out. When another tries to steal—
keep it out. Stories thin and stories
tall, good and bad, and big and small
—anything that’s news at all—hear
’em shout—“keep it out.”—Muldrow

A VENETIAN LEGACY.
On the far Venetian Islands,
Off the North Italian shore,
Dwelt a band of crafty pirates,
In heroic days of yore.
They patrolled the Adriatic;
Every merchantman they hailed,
And they vigorously inspected
Every cargo ship that sailed.
On every ship they chanced to meet
They levied ten per cent,
“For protecting them from Pi
rates” —
But they all knew what it meant.
They figured when a ship had passed
Inspection twenty times,
They had it twice, and still it sailed
From cold to sunny climes.
With ten per cent —the “tenariff”,
They built the city Venice,
Where proudly flew the pirate flag
Os their commercial menace.
Long years have passed and they
have gone,
Those old Venetian Pirates —
The Tariff they bequeathed to us
Still holds its own in high rates.
