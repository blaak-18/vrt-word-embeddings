An Editorial, An Outburst and Twilight
FACTS VERSUS FANCIFUL CLAIMS
THE EDITORIAL
(From Red Wing Daily Eagle)
The talk of Gov. Smith of New
York becoming a candidate for the
presidency of the United States is, of
course wholly gratutious and entire
ly out side of the issue. Not on ac
count of his not being personally as
desirable and competent as any
one that may come up for the posi
tion. But because his religious af
filiation is such that he is more or
less subject to the domination, of a
higher power, emanating from a for
eign country, than he himself might
wish to exercise.
Being a Roman Catholic, descend
ed from Roman Catholic stock, as is
Gov. Smith, is in no way a discridit
to his individually, any more than
being something else denomination
ally on the part of himself or any
other person. But when it comes to
being elevated to the head of a na
tion, founded and developed on the
basis of absolute isolation from for
eign religious dominance, naturally
a person allied with a denomination
whose ruling headquarters is located
in, and belongs to a foreign coun
try, can, under no circumstances, be
elected.
So, what’s the use.
THE OUTBURST
To the Editor of the Daily Eagle:
Nothing has hurt my feelings in
many a long day so much as your
editorial “So, What’s the Use?” in
iast night’s Eagle.
I have esteemed and respected you
and your family for nearly twenty
years. And I have always cherished
the fond hope that you in turn es
teemed and respected me.
In the editorial in question, how
ever, you attack the loyalty and pa
triotism of me and of every other
Catholic not only in Red Wing, but
throughout this whole country. In
discussing the possibility of the elec
tion to the presidency of the United
States of Governor Smith of New
York, you declare that his election is
not to be thought of simply because
he is a Catholic, “because his relig
ious affiliation is such that he is
more or less subject to the domina
tion of a higher power, emanating
from a foreign country, than he
himself might wish to exercise.”
And in the next paragraph you re
iterate the same argument, saying
that the objection of Smith’s candi
dacy is due o the fact tha he is al
lied with a denomination whose rul
ing headquarters is located in, and
belongs to a foreign country.”
This, in spite of the fact that
Article VI of the Constitution of the
Unied States says explicitly: “No
religious test shall ever be required
as a qualification to any office or
public trust under the United
States!”
One quality that I have always
admired in you is your sincerity.
And so I take it for granted that you
do not make this charge against the
loyalty of American Catholics with
out actually believing that it is
true.
And yet nothing can be farther
from the truth than this. Won’t you
believe taht I am telling the truth
when I say that the authority of the
Pope over the Catholics of America
is limited exclusively to religious
matters; that he has nothing what
ever to do with politics, and that if,
to suppose the impossible, he were to
sail across the ocean to attack this
beloved country of ours, the Catho
lics of America would be the first of
our citizens to drive him back far
from our sacred shores? In such an
important matter as this, will
you be guided by the utterances of
the enemies of my church, or by
the official declarations of my church’s
leaders ?
This distinction between religious
authority and political authority,
and this restriction of the authority
of the Pope to exclusively religious
matters, has been made so often and
so publicly that one would think no
misunderstanding could be possible.
And I am frank to say that this re
vival of an old calumny by one whom
I long have considered a friend hurts
me more than I can tell.
Surely, if there is any one class
in this country who can claim to be
loyal and true citizens, it is the
Catholics. It was a Catholic who dis
covered America (whether you give
the honor to Christopher Columbus
or to Leif Ericson). It was Catho
lics who first explored the continent
from sea to sea. It was the Catholic
Lord Baltimore who first establishel
religious freedom in our land. And
in every crisis from that day down
to this, the Catholics of America
have done more than their share to
maintain the institutions of their
country. Over fifty percent of the
American soldiers in the Revolution
ary War were Catholics. In the Civil
War the Catholics of the Union
Army were more than twice their
proportion to the population of the
country. In the recent World War,
at a time when Catholics were per-
haps 15 per cent of the population,
Secretary of War Baker himself de
clared that 35 per cent of the army
was Catholic. In the navy, 60 per
cent were Catholics; in the marines,
nearly 75 per cent. The first Amer
ican to shed his blood in that war was
William T. Fitzsimmons, a Catholic;
and the last to give up his life on
the very morning of the armistice,
was Father William F. Devitt, a
Catholic chaplain. And every boy
who saw service overseas knows how
much the great Catholic order, the
Knights of Columbus, did for Jew,
and Protestant, and Catholic alike.
Does all this indicate that the Amer
ican Catholic cannot be a loyal citi
zen?
Colonel Hanford Macnider, when
commander of the American Legion,
in a scathing rebuke addressed to
the editor of The Protestant, Wash
ington, D. C., said: “I have a great
admiration for that institution —the
Roman Catholic Church. Its stand
and teaching for the preservation of
the integrity of our lawful govern
ment were well exemplified in the
heroic deaths of men who served in
my command. And might I add that
chaplains of that faith gave a human
touch to their splendid service which
made them beloved by all—Jew,
Protestant and Catholic alike. Such
propaganda as you are spreading is
a menace to America and America’s
institutions. How a man worships
his God is his own business, and not
yours. The constitution of the Unit
ed States of America gives every
man the right to choose his own re
ligion, and it was to uphold that
constitution tha he American Le
gion was formed.”
To say that because a man is a
Catholic he cannot serve his coun
try with undivided loyalty is a foul
aspersion on the patriotism of those
Catholic lads who gave their lives
side by side with their Jewish and
Protestant comrades at Chateau
Thierry and Belleau Wood. Such a
charge as that is an insult to me
personally; for I solemnly profess
that I am as orthodox a Catholic as
any other man, layman or Pope, in
all this world, and with equal
solemnity I claim that I am as loyal
and true an American citizen as any
other man in all the broad expanse
of these United States.
I feel that your editorial has done
us Catholics great harm by spread
ing abroad an oft-refuted calumny.
And therefore I ask you in common
justice to give equal publicity to this
letter of mine.
Yours faithfully.
OLIVER DOLPHIN.
“TWILIGHT”
I read the editorial which appeared
in the Red Wing Daily Eagle, with
very much interest, but it was with
unusual interest that I read the com
munication which Father Oliver
Dolphin sent to the Daily Eagle and
which was printed in that publication.
As far as I know, the editor of the
Daily Eagle has made no effort to
answer the priests’s letter, so I there
fore wish to correct several erroneous
statements that appear in Father Dol
phin’s epistle.
Obvious.y, Father Dolphin appears
as a defender of Gov. Alcohol Smith
cf New York. Plainly you see the
reason for the priest’s outburst, and
it is not strange that the Father ig
nores well known facts pertaining to
the double citizenship of Roman Cath
olics. I defy Father Dolphin to prove
that the church does not teach the
importance of all Roman Catholics
standing by the church rather than
the state, when a final decision must
be made. Not only do I challenge
the priest on this point, but I submit
herewith conclusive proof that the
Roman church does not accept the
principle of eternal separation of
church and state.
My charge is, that the Roman
Catholic hierarchy is not only seek
ing to unite Church and State in
America, but seeks complete domin
ion over this Government, dictating
the Laws that shall be passed and en
forced. Also, that no consistent
member of the Roman Catholic church
can be a one hundred per cent Ameri
can, for the reason that his Oath to
maintain the Constitution of the
United States would be in direct con
flict with his oath of allegiance to the
Pope of Rome.
While it may be true that a large
number of Roman Catholics are not
aware of it (which is also true of
many intellectual protestants) yet it
is the ambition, purpose, and design
of the Roman system to have an
American church, dominated by the
Pope, and to change the whole pur
pose and design of the founders of
this Republic. This I shall substan
tiate with witnesses from the Roman
Catholic church, as follows:
POPE PIUS IX. (Paragraphs from
the Syllabus of Pius IX, issued Dec.
8, 1864, confirmed by “Decrees of In
fallibility, n and made eternal and
equal in authority with the Deca
logue by the Council of the Vatican
1870. The rights and powers of the
church are affirmed).
1. The Church has a right to re
quire the State NOT to leave every
man free to profess his own religion:
2. The Church has the right to ex
ercise her power without permission
or consent of the State.
3. The Church has the right to
prevent the foundation of any nat
ional church, not subject to the au
thority of the Roman Pontiff:
4. The Church has the right to
deprive the Civil authority of the
entire government of public schools:
5. The Church has the right of
perpetuating the union of Church and
State.
6. The Church has the right to re
quire that the Catholic religion be
the only religion of the State, to the
exclusion of all others:
7. The Church has he right and
power of requiring the State not to
permit free expression of opinion.”
POPE PIUS XIII, in his Encyclical
January 10, 1870, says: “Cases hap
pen in which the State demands one
thing from the citizen, and religion
the opposite from Christians, and
this undoubtedly for no other reason
than that the heads of the State
pay no regard to he sacred power of
the Church, or desire to make it sub
ject to them. No one, however, can
doubt which is to receive the prefer
ence. It is an impious deed to break
the laws of Jesus Christ for the pur
pose of obeying magistrates, or to
transgress the laws of the Church
under pretext of obeying the Civil
law.’
Again, in November, 1890, this
says: “All Catholics should exert
their power to cause the Constitutions
of the States to be modeled on the
principles of their Church.”
POPE GREGORY-XII., says: “The
power of he Church is superior to the
power pf the State.”
POPE MARTIN V., sent this letter
to the King of Poland. (Cormenin,
Vol. 11, page 116): “Know that the in
terests of the Holy See, and those of
your Crown, make it a duty to ex
terminate the Hussites * * * While
there is still time, then, turn your
rorces against Bohemia: burn massa
cre, make deserts everywhere, for
nothing could be more agreeable to
God, or more useful to the cause of
kings, than the extermination of the
Hussites.”
POPE MARCELLUS. (See Decrees,
Corpus Juris Canonici, part 2, chap.
18). “A heretic merits the pains of
fire. By the Gospel, the canons, civ
il law and custom, heretics must be
burned.”
POPE GREGORY IX., (See Decre
tals of Gregory IX, book 5, title 7).
“All persons may attack any rebels to
the church, and despoil them of their
wealth, and slay them, and burn
their houses and cities.”
Schaff’s “Church History,” Vol 11.,
sec. 27, says: “The secular power
shall swear to exterminate all here
tics condemned by the Church, and
if they do not they shall be anathe
ma.”
It must be remembered that the
“Encyclicals” of the Pope means that
he is interpreting the law, just as
the judge “charges the jury.” Then,
if the laws of the Vatican, the Pope
and the Church, are to take prece
dence over the laws of the United
States, and the members of the Ro
man Catholic church are obliged to
obey the Pope rather than the laws of
our country, how can they claim 100
per cent Americanism?
Following up the laws of the Vati
can, let us see what a few of the
Pope’s subordinates have to say:
BISHOP GILMORE, in his Lenten
Letter, March 1873: “If we hold our
own amid the universal war that is
going on, we must be more united.
Nationality must be made subordinate
to religion, and we must learn that
we are Catholics first, and citizens
next. God is above man, and the
Church is above the state. At pres
ent, we have nothing to hope for
from the State.”
PRIEST PHELAN, Editor, West
ern Watchman, Catholic, June 27,
1912: “Tell us that we are Catholics
first, and Americans or Englishmen
afterwards; of course we are. Tell
us, that in a conflict between the
Church and the Civil government we
take the side of the Church; of
course we do. Why, if the Govern
ment of the United States were at
war with the Church, we would say
tomorrow, TO HELL WITH THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED
STATES; if the Church and all the
governments of the world were at
war, we would say TO HELL WITH
ALL THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE
WORLD. Why is it that in this coun
try where we have only 17 per cent
of the population, the Catholic Church
is so mud) feared. She is loved by
all her children, and feared by every
body. Why is it that the Pope has
such tremendous power? Why, the
Pope is the ruler of the world. All
the emperors, all the kings, all the
princes, all the presidents of the
world are as these altar boys. The
Pope 4s the ruler of the world.”
This same editor under date Ibf
September 24, 1911, cays: “Civil in-
The CALL OF THE NORTH
dependence is absolutely necessary
for the free and untrammeled exer
cise of the Supreme Pontiff. The Su
preme head of the Universal Church
cannot consistently with the dignity
of his office, or the exercise of the
powers of which he is the depositary,
be the subject of any government,
but must not only possess, but exer
cise.”
W. ARTHUR’S “The Pope, the
King, and the People,” Vol. 2, page
265, says: “Every Catholic whose act
ions are ruled by faith he professes is
a born enemy to the State, since he
finds himself bound in conscience to
contribute as far as in him lies to
the subjection of all nations, and all
kings, to the Roman Pontiff.”
CATHOLIC WORLD, VOL. XI., No.
64, 1870, says: “While the State has
rights, she has them only in virtue
and by permission of superior author
ity, and that authority can only be
expressed through the Church; that
is, through the organic law, infalli
bly announced and unchangeably as
serted, regardless of temporal conse
quences.”
Again it says: “The supreme duty
of Catholics is to obey the Pope, and
seek in every way, and especially b'y
means of the ballot, to render 'the
Catholic policy effective in this coun
try. Catholics should vindicate this
policy with property, liberty, and life.
If the Pope’s authority and that of
any Civil government comes into con
flict upon any vital point, the Catho
lic is to act in the 19th century pre
cisely as he did in the Ist and 2nd
century.”
Again this same paper in a leading
article of September, 1871, entitled
“The Reformation Not Conservative”
and referring to the United States
Government, says: “We do not accept
it, or hold it to be any Government
at all, or capable of performing any
of the proper functions of govern
ment, and if it continues to be inter
preted by the revolutionary principle
of Protestantism it is sure to fall—
and lose itself either in the supremacy
of the mob or in military depotism;
and doom us, like unhappy France, to
alternate between with the mob up
permost today, and the despot to
morrow.”
Again, this editor writes: “There
has never been a period in American
history when the Church’s opportu
nity has been so close to her. To a
great extent the old antagonisms have
died. Protestantism is disintegrating
before our eyes. The moment is now
ripe to build a CATHOLIC AMER
ICA, and the strong men are now
laying the foundation.”
SHEPHERD OF THE VALLEY, a
Roman Catholic paper published at
St. Louis, Mo., in 1876, under the su
pervision of Archbishop Kendrick,
says: “We confess that the Roman
Catholic Church is intolerant; that is
to say, that it uses all the means in
its power for the extirpation of er
ror and sin; but this intolerance is
the logical and necessari-consequence
of her infallibility. She alone has
the right to be intolerant, because she
alone has the truth. The Church
tolerates heretics where she is obliged
to do so, but she hates them mortally,
and employs all her forces to secure
their annihilation. When the Catho
lics shall be in possession of a con
siderable majority, which will certain
ly be the case by and by—then relig
ious liberty will have to come to an
end in the United States. Our ene
mies say this, and we believe with
them. Our enemies know that we do
not pretend to be better than our
Church, and in what concerns her his
tory is open to all. They know, then,
how the Roman church dealt with
heretics in the middle ages and how
she deals with them today where
she has the power. We think no
more of denying these historic facts
than we do of blaming the saints of
God and the princes of the Church for
what they have done and approved,
in these matters.”
MORNING STAR: New Orleans,
May 21, 1913, says: “Twenty-five
years hence the Catholics of the
United States will not be sixteen
million, but twice that number. The
vote will be in their hands and the
future Republic will depend upon their
use of it.'
BRONSON’S REVIEW: Dr. Bron
son, a renowned prevert from protes
tantism, now a recognized Catholic
authority, in Bronson’s Review, April
1845, says: “If the Church should di
rect the Catholic citizens of this
American Republic to abolish the Con
stitution, the liberty, and the very
existence of the country as a Sov
ereign state, and transfer it to the
crown of Louis Napoleon Bonaparts,
they are bound by a divine ordinance
to obey.”
This man again says, in his Re
view, June 1851: “The Pope has the
right to pronounce sentence of deposi
tion against any sovereign, when re
quired by the good of the spiritual or
der * * * the power of the Church
exercised over sovereigns in the Mid
dle Ages was not usupation, was not
derived from the concessions of
princes or the consent of the people,
but was and is held by divine right,
and he who resists it, rebels against
the King of kings and Lord of lords.”
Again: In his Quarterly Review,
January 1854, Brompn says: “What
the Church has doite, what she has
expresed or tacitly approved in the
past, that is exactly what she will do,
express, or tacitly approve in the fu
ture, if the same circumstances oc
cur.”
In the “Catholic World,” September,
1871, page 736, Bronson says: “Inter
preted by the Protestant principle, so
-widely diffused among us *■* * we do
not accept it, or hold it to be any
Government at all, or as capable of
performing any of the proper func
tions of government. * * * If the
American Republic is to be sustained
and preserved at all, it must be by
the rejection of the Reformation,
(separation of church and state) and
the acceptance of the Catholic princi
ple by the American people.”
CATHOLIC WEEKLY: Albany, N.
Y., says: “We are Catholics first, last,
and all the time. Our career is to
enlighen Catholics of every nation
ality, and to defend the Church
against every comer, no matter who
or what he is. When the Pope speaks
the Church speaks, and when the
Church speaks, God speaks. Though
we love our country dearly, we love
our Church more.”
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. In
the Catholic school book, “The Abridg
ed Course of Religious Instruction,
pages 178-203, used in the Catholic
schools of America, the following is
taught:
“The will of the Pope is the Su
preme law of all lands.”
Again: “In every promissory oath,
although taken, there are certain con
ditions tacitly understood, among
which are:
1. ‘lf I can.’
2. ‘To save the right and author
ity of a Superior.’
3. When the Oath supposes the
right and honor of the Apostolic See
to be illicit’.”
This is not only teaching the young
Roman Catholic that the law of the
Pope is superior to the law of his
Government, but also that he has a
right to lie under certain circum
stances, especially when dealing with
Protestants. This is known among
Catholics as “Mental Reservations.”
If Father Dolphin will read the en
tire Constitution with care, he will
learn that no man can serve as Presi
dent of the Uniter 1 States and hold
allegiance to any power, prince, king,
pope, potentate or ruler or govern
ment of any kind that is foreign to
the United States. We doubt very
much if Alcohol Smith of New York
could take a real oath of office that
is required of all Presidents, which
would completely bind him to the du
ties of our government. It is true
that Alcohol Smith could take his
oath in a verbal way, but in a crisis
his church permits him to ignore such
an oath when a stand for the church
.s demanded.
Father Dolphin states that Lief
Ericcson, the discoveror of America,
was a Roman Catholic. Of course;
he does not submit any proof in mak
ing this contention, expecting people
to swallow his statement entirely.
Why do the various Roman Catholic
organizations oppose so bitterly a
due recognition of the Norseman's
achievements? It is a well known
fact that Roman Catholic organiza
tions have for a long time been seek
ing a nation-wide observance of Col
umbus Day. History clearly proves
that Columbus did not discover Ahaer
ica, but the historical proofs are ig
nored entirely in the zealous efforts
of Romanists to force an unjustifi
able recognition of Christopher Col
umbus. Surely the opposition to a
recognition of Lief Ericcson reveals
a “nigger in the woodpile.” If Lief
Ericcson had been a Roman Catholic,
it is very clear even to the casual
thinker that very little opposition to
the recognition of Lief Ericson’s
work would come from the camps of
the Romanists. Distorters of History
have long been laboring in the United
States, and have been remarkably
successful in securing the injection of
false statements into American school
hi-tories. The result is that the
American school histories are filled
with half truths, near truths and
falsehoods, with but few exceptions.
For a long time, the Knights of Col
umbus have been threatening to re
write American history, yes, and
have partially rewritten the history
of the United States. Americans will
watch, however, all efforts to make
American histories instruments of
propaganda, when in fact they should
be accurate sources of historical in
formation.
In a previous issue of the Call of
the North, we proved that Roger Wil
liams and not Lord Baltimore, first
founded a colony on absolute relig
ious freedom. The so-called “Tolera
tion £ct,” enacted by Lord Baltimore,
granted religious freedom only to
Christians. and therefore was not an
act of complete toleration. Before
Lord Baltimore brought forth his act
of Toleration, the Rhode Island ool»
ony had been founded, with absolute
religious freedom granted. This point
is merely a metter of elementary his
tory that any school child should
know.
We note the percentages in Father
Dolphin’s communication with much
interest and I can’t help but be very
much amused at the wild claims made
by the Romanists. The frantic efforts
of Romanists to force themselves to
the front as the greatest Americans,
is so ridiculous as to be comical.
Permit me to present a few facts
as eye-openers:
The exploits of the so-called “Irish
Brigade” at the battle of Fredericks
burg have been glorified ad nausem,
but always with Meagher, the com
mander the central, figure. The
facts in the case are these: the five
regiments composing the Irish Bri
gade lost in all at that battle, 545
men, while five American regiments
(145th Penn., 34th Penn., sth N. H.,
13th Penn and 11th N. H.), lost 944
men—including in both cases kiled,
wounded and missing; and yet we are
constantly told that the Irish regi
ments (especially the 69th N. Y.)
were “swept out of existence;” but
the fact is, the 69th N. Y. lost But
10 killed, 95 wounded and 23 missing
—l2B in all; while the 145th Penn,
lost 229 men, the 11th N. H. 195, and
the sth N. H. 193 —these latter being
purely American (not Irish) regi
ments. But they never boast of their
exploits.
Due to the influence of Roman Bish
ops, Ireland REFUSED TO BE
DRAFTED AGAINST ROMAN
CATHOLIC AUSTRIA, and the al
lies had trouble throughout the en
tire conflict from Irish Catholic spies
who were working against righteous
ness and FOR the pope and the
kaiser.
The whold world knows that France
had been waiting for years for the
chance of getting a whack at Ger
many, end neither did she wait and
follow England, but she took the lead
and said she would go it alone if nec
essary. Belgium, moreover, did not
JOIN with England UNTIL the Ger
man armies had ruthlessly trespased
upon her territory and mistreated
and massacred her citizens. England
and its influence had nothing to do
with Belgium’s entrance into the war
—it was a case of self-defense.
Rome made a lot of the alleged
statements by Secretary Denby, thal
the Romanists furnished 45 per cent
of the marines. Even if this is true,
which we seriously doubt, what did
it amount to? They knew well that
the navy would have but little to do
with land fighting and that the Great
War would be mostly a land affair.
True to their training and senti
ments, they managed to get where
they were least likely to lose their
lives, but it must be remembered that
these Roman Catholics WERE
DRAFTED. Few of them, compara
tively, enlisted voluntarily. Like
their brothers in Cork and Dublin,
they hated Protestantism and went
only as far as they had to go.
Now the simple facts are that our
Irish-American patriots of the Rev
olution were almost to a man Protes
tants. The immigration of Irish Ro
man Catholics here did not begin till
long after vast numbers of Irishmen
did noble service on our frontiers in
the French and Indian and Revolu
tionary Wars. But they were all
Presbyterians of the most rigid sort.
Many Irish names appear on the pa
triot rolls of New Hampshier. They
too, were all Presbyterians. They
were the so-called Scotch-Irish. Of
that stock came out honored fellow
citizens, the McGregors, the Bells,
the Morrisons, etc. A large number
of Presbyterians in the North of Ire
lanr, wishing to be free of English
monarchial and ecclesiastical rule, had
sent an agent here in 1728, to Shute,
then the royal governor of Massachu
setts, in order to obtain grants of land
on which they might settle. The ar
rangement was perfected the next
yesr by the occupation by them of
Londonderry, N. H. They were the
beginning of a strong accession from
that grand Celtic stock. John Sulli
van, of Berwick, Ne., the founder of
that patriotic family here, was, to Be
sure of a Roman Catholic family of
the south of Ireland. He landed at
York, Me., in 1723, and was befriend
ed in his poverty (he was a school
teacher),, by the famous Parso'n
Moody. As he did not attend the ser
vices at the meeting house, it was in
ferred that he kept to his ancestrfil
faith. But his family tradition is that

he became what is called a “Bible-

ever (including Gemeral Sullivan and
Gov. Sullivan), have all been Protest
ants. It would be difficult for the
last Bunker Hill orator to name a
single Irish Roman Catholic who was
in the patriots ranks in the battle.
They were all Yankees of the most
pronounced stock. It is not probable
that any of them had ever seen a
priest, for then there was no such
person here. One of the victims of
the Boston massacre (Patrick Carr)
is said to have been an Irishman; but
of what religion, if any, nobody
knows. He lingered some time in full
consciousness after his wound. There
