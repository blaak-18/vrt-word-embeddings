JEWS OPPOSED TO
INTERMARRIAGE,
DECLARES RABBI
Dr. Nathan Krass of Tem

IS RELIGIOUS STAND
All Right for Christians to Pro*
selyte, but Not for Members
of Own Race
(Bureau of Publication and Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON. D. C., March 24.
Jews are opposed to intermarriage
on religious and not on racial
grounds, said Rabbi Nathan Krass at
Temple Emanuel, New York City in
his recent sermon on “Intermarriage.”
Dr. Krass advices Jews to wed Jews
and says the chances of happiness
are dubious when parties are not of
the same religious faith. At the
best he declares that marriage is a
lottery and he advises against inter
marriage with Christians.
Beginning his sermon Dr. Krass
pointed out that the question of in
termarriage was almost as old as
humanity and that among the very
ancient peoples laws against marry
ing out of the tribe or other ethnic
division were current. ,
“But strange as it mav seem, these
prohibitions were not due to racial
reasons,” he said. “The chief reason
for putting an embargo on intermar
riages was religious Among the an
cient Jews, according to the Biblical
record, we find prohibition against
intermarriage, particularly with sev
en nations that are mentioned by
name. The reason assigned for this
prohibition in the Bible is not rac
ial inferiority but religious inferidr
ity. These seven nations were idola
trous. Therefore, the Jews could not
countenance exegamous marriage
lest the idalatrous practices of the
pagans adulterate Judaism.
Intermarriages In Bible
“On the other hand it is quite il
luminating to note that a number of
Biblical heroes married non-Jews.
Joseph married an Egyptian. Moses
married a Cushite. Judah married a
Canaanite. Sampson married a Philis
tine. Another Jew of humbler origin
married a Moabite woman who has
attained great fame, namely Ruth.
“From the Book of Ezra, dating
back to the fifth century before the
Christian era we learn that inter
marriages were numerous among the
Jews so that Ezra had to resort to
drastic measures when he re-esta
blished the Jewish community by
forcing all who married outside the
faith to put away their strange
wives.
“All through the ages Jews have
married outside of Judaism and were
thus lost to Israel and the faith and
non-Jews married into Judaism and
thus were added to and absorbed by
Israel. All these historical facts
prove conclusively that there was
never among the Jews any objection
to intermarriage merely on racial
grounds. The chief reason among
the Jews as among the Catholics for
example, used against intermarriage,
was religious. The mixture of alien

Many Fine Gifts
Are Presented by
Georgia Klansmen
BAINBRIDGE. GA., March 24 —The
Ku Klux Klan in this community has
bestowed some very useful and ac
ceptable gifts throughout the city
within the last few months. The
first gift from the organization that
became public was a check of $25 to
all of the churches and a very gener
ous contribution to the Rev. Twigg
Thomas, who conducted a revival in
the First Presbyterian church re
cently.
The reception room in the new
grammar school building has been
beautifully furnished by them.
Handsome reed furniture, upholstered
in soft-colored elegant material,
rockers, lounges, straight chairs, ta
bles, coat-rack and large rug, deco

elements always tends to weaken the
faith.
Attitude the Same
“The attitude of the Jew today is
still the same. We are opposed to
intermarriage because in our own
religious mission and we feel that
whatever tends to weaken that mis
sion ought not to be encouraged. By
intermarriage we understand the un
ion of two persons of different faiths
who after marriage still cling to
their respective religions.
“Marriage is indeed a lottery and
persons of similar tastes, habits, cus
toms and outlook upon life are likely
to be better mated than those whose
origins and outlooks are different.
Those who view life eye to eye are
more likely to walk in harmony than
those who strive to go in opposite
directions.
“For persons hailing from differ
ent religions to marry is indeed tak
ing a dubious step. Toe conflicts and
clashes in the home, particularly
when children are to be reared, are
indicative of disaster, not of happi
ness. The Jews are a minority peo
ple in America, 3,000,000 out of 110,-
000,000. The minority is always in
danger of being absorbed through in
termarriage by the majority, and if
intermarriage increased, Jews as
Jews would diminish."
Dr. Krass then winds up his ser
mon by declaring that the liberal
Jew of today has much in common
with the liberal Christian but not
enough to overcome that psychic
heritage which each possesses. He
also says he welcomes proselytes, but
he wants the proselyting done among
Christians and not among the Jews.
It is anything to break down
the Christian religion in this coun
try. The same thing is true of the
Catholics all over the country, they
want to gain the Christians but don't
want to lose any of their own faith.
Warrant Issued for
Deportation of Alien

Angol Ricci, Italian, was arrested
here recently on a deportation war
rant from Washington and taken to
Kansas City by E. P. Reynolds. U. S.
immigration agent. It is charged
that he is an alien, who was smug
gled into this country through Cana
da, after he had been excluded and
deported at Sault Ste, Marie, Mich.,
on November 11, 1922. The three per
cent quota for his country was ex
hausted and his passport was not in
proper shape.

“ * * A MOST INGENIOUS PARADOX” i
DEB MOINES JUDICIAL CANDIDATE ATTEMPTS TO
LIVE UP TO PHRASE IN GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S
COMIC OPERA, “THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER”
In the liberetto of his famous
comic opera, “The Chocolate Sold
ier,” George Bernard Shaw, the fam
ous British playright, has a song, the
chorus of which runs, “A paradox, a
paradox, a most ingenious paradox.”
It really seems as though some Des
Moines municipal candidates were
well acquainted with that catchy bit
of verse. They truly seem to be liv
ing up to the sentiment of the song,
by composing paradox after paradox
in their public addresses.
There is C. H. Johnston the anti-
Klan candidate for municipal judge.
His would-be honor gravely warns
his audiences that the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan are a menace to Amer
ican civilization. He paints a dire
picture of the machinations of the
nooded, outlaw band, as he likes his
auditors to think of it. Then he
says, “But, I don’t think there are
very many of them, at least not as
many as they claim.”
There’s the parado-x; there are not
very many of them, but they are a
menace to America. Mr. Johnston
should realize that it is going to take
a large group to constitute a real
menace to American civilization.
Mr. Johnston’s paradoxical mind
manifests itself in another way. The
lowa Fiery Cross is a propoganda
sheet, he claims. At practically ev
ery meeting, he uses the paper in
his talks, to illustrate some of the
points. Well, why use the paper,
and point out stories in it, as evi
dence of the Klan power, influence
and growth, and make the public be
lieve it, if the paper is just “a pro
paganda sheet?”
Mr. Johnston is a Mason. He says
he would be opposed to the Masons
like he is to the Klan, if the former
camo out into politics. "I wouldn’t
object to the Ku Kluxers if they
kept to themselves, carried on their
activities in the lodge and stayed out
of politics.”
In other words if the Klan were a
pink-tea, gossip society, Mr. Johns
ton could see in it much good for the
advancement of civilization and cul
ture in the United States. But with
its members taking upon themselves
the riphts of free-born American cit
izens, and manifesting an interest in
public affairs, the organization is all
wrong.
“They realize they made a blunder
if they have any sense. I don't think
such an incident will occur again in
Des Moines.” In these words Mr.
Johnston commented upon the audi
ence and chairman at the political
meeting on the East Side last week,
which forced him to desist from his
radical anti-Klan tirade and leave
the hall. From what the writer can
learn, no one who was at the meet
ing seems to think that a blunder
Klansmen Are Asked to
Locate Missing Nurse
TENNILLE, GA., March 24.
Klansmen have been asked by Dr. B.
O. Joiner of this place to assist him
in locating Miss Adline Joiner, who
disappeared from the Georgia state
sanitarium at Milledgeville, Georgia,
December 13. 1923. where she was
employed as a graduate nurse. She
has not been heard from by any of
her relatives since that date. She is
described as being 22 years of age,
blue-gray eye's, wears glasses, chest
nut hair, fair complexion, and
weighs about 135 pounos and is five
feet, eight inches in height.
It is believed by her relatives that
she went east. However she at one
time took a special caurse at the
Memphis general hospital, Memphis,
Tennneaaee, and has many frienus in
that state.

wu made. In British politics, the
audience invariably takes upon itself
the right to inform a speaker whe
ther or not they are in accord with
his remarks. Now that an American
audience has manifested this inter
est, and so informed Mr. Johnston, he
is somewhat perturbed.
Because American voters are be
ginning to show s little political con
sciousness, Mr. Johnston is very much
“put out.” We fear that as time
goes on and Americans awake to their
rights and privileges as citizens, they
will realize it is no longer necessary
to sit complacently in front of a man
and let him rave to his heart’s con
tent without voicing a protest or ex
pressing approval, as they desire.
LAWRENCEVILLE, ILL
KLAN SHOWS GROWTH
Order Has Representative Mem
bership of 1000 Ameri
can Men
LAWRENCEVILLE. ILL., March
24. The 1-swrenceville county Klan,
organized a little more than one
year ago, has had a tremendous
growth. From a membership of two
or three, it has grown to the one
thousand mark and is still going by
leaps and bonds.
The Klan membership is made up
of the best citizens of the county,
including some of the most promin
ent and influential men in the state.
Its Christian affiliations are made up
of representatives of all Protestant
churches in the county. Already the
bootleggers have felt its teeth.
When a crusade against the liquor
traffic was launched last September
several bootleggers fell victims and
were convicted.
The churches here have all receiv
ed donations from the Klan. Several
thousands of dollars have been spent
to the good of the county in the last
year. A Boy Scout campaign is on
now, and is expected to receive its
share of financial aid.
A committee has been appointed
to buy a suitable location for a
Klavern, which will soon be erected.
A Bible and a flag have been placed
in each of the public schools. The
Klan is already planning a large
Fourth of July celebration.
With the coming spring elections,
local Klansmen are considering ev
ery candidate very closely as to his
ability. Those not considered worthy
will surely meet with defeat, as this
Klan now has on its “long britches
and gallowses,” and can spit pretty
well where it wants to.
Spokes From John
The eye of the interested Klans
men will henceforth follow sharply
the acts of those genial politicians
who are suspected of possessing oil
terior motives.

KEY WEST. FLA., March 24. The
Realm of Florida is now preparing
for a great membership campaign.
All sections of the state are united
in the work of presenting the ideals
and purposes of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan to those who are eli
gible and worthy of membership.

At each of these meetings the
Grand Dragon, the Grand Kligrapp,
and a service man from the depart

respective provinces.
One hundred per cent attendance
was the record hung up at these
meetings of the various provinces,
and one hundred per cent enthusism
was registered on the plan for the

America’s Right
(Siaux City Journal)
The Milwaukee Kuryer Polski in
an editorial attack on the Johnson
immigration bill declared the meas
ure, “whicn seeks to restrict immi
gration from various countries of
the world on the basis of 2 per cent
of the number of any nationality in
this'country at the time of the 1890
census, is the most discriminatory
piece of legislation that has been
proposed in recent years." The Kur
yer Polski is a Polish newspaper, one
of the many Milwaukee publications
that devote themselves more partic
ularly to foreign than to American
political and sociological interests,
which observation may serve to dull
somewhat the point of its lance.
The Kuryer Polski thinks that what
ever the percentage of restriction
should be, if it were based on the
1920 census the various nationalities
in question “would have no just
cause for complaint against the quo
tas allowed them; on the contrary
they would, as Americans, give the
new immigration bill their hearty
support." This makes it plain enough
that the Kuryer Polski expects Amer
ican citizens of late foreign extrac
tion to hold on for a long time to
alien habits and customs and alien
principtes and methods of thinking,
and thus to slow down the process
of Americanization. The encourage
ment of that phrase of life for new
comers in America seems to be the
chief aim and purpose of the fore
ign language newspapers published
here, and nothing else, perhaps, is
as great a hindrance to their assimi
lation. The Kuryer Polski refers to
these people as Americans, but tells
them they should demand a greater
consideration on the part of this
country for the nationalties from
which they have came. It is obvious
that such an attitude creates too
great an interest in the minds of so
called Americans in the welfare of
the peoples from which they have
separated themselves and too little
in the future of the country they
have made theirs by adoption. It is
natural, of course, for naturalized
citizens to desire that the privilege
of admittance be extended to their
near relatives left in the old country,
and that, it is understood, will be
provided for in the new immigration
law. It is not so natural for Amer
ican citizens who have become real
Americans to cling to racial kinship.
These should learn to think of Ameri
ca first, but foreign language news
papers keep them in line for many
generations thinking first of all of
the countries whence they came.
Continuing its attack, the Kuryer
Polski declares:
“Assuming that a decrease of immi
gration is necessary (which we do not
believe) adoption of the 1890 census
as a basis is obviously unjust, unfair,
and discriminatory, and its enactment
will be an insult to all but two ot
the nationalities affected by the pro
posed bill. If immigration must be
restricted, let it be done on a basis
of equality to all and favoritism to
none, and any bill conceived in this
spirit will undoubtedly meet with
widespread support and approbation.”
The Kuryer Polski already has
established that it considers the John
son immigration bill unjust, unfair,
discriminatory and insulting from
two standpoints, the one on account
of the views of the naturalized Amer
icans of various nationalities, and
the other because of nationalities
wholly foreign to this country, peo
ples who now live in other lands. One
might ask the Kuryer Polski if it be
lieves the national policy in this
country should be dictated by those
elements recently brought from other
lands instead of by the older genera
tions of Americans, who have,by vir
tue of education, training and inheri
tance, sensed more profoundly the
ideals of liberty and progress Mean
while, as far as the other standpoint
is concerned, the United States does
not owe a single obligation to any
country on earth in the matter of ab
sorbing its surplus population. The
thing for Americans to remember -
and it is a thing the foreign lan
guage newspaper in this country has
never even learned in shaping an
immigration policy and in enacting
a permanent immigration law is the
nation's duty to itself. And even at
the risk of being regarded as die
criminatory, unfair and unjust to
wai d other nationalities, the United
States should adopt a policy that
would give it the greatest measure
of protection. America’s right to pick
ana choose immigrants need not be
confined to the fit individuals of a
given race but may be extended to
the fittest of the races.

MUST UPHOLD SABBATH
t'hurrhmen Who Do Not (‘p-Op
erate With Klan. Turning
Down Best Friends
CHARLESTON W. VA. March 23.
Declaring that the Ku Klux Klan
may save the Christian church from
destruction and further asserting that
any church official who opposes the
Klan is fighting the church’s best
friend, Walter M. Morris. Mount
Clare, widely known newspaper man.
legislator and veteran of the civil
war, has written a short article for
this newspaper in which he takes se
verely to task all church officials
who have been opposing the Klan.
Mr. Morris, who is more than 81
vears of age, is widely known in West
Virginia, having figured prominently
in the memorable session of the West
Virginia legislature in 1918. He has
been active in politics for more than
forty-five years. Mr. Morris is not
and will not be a candidate for any
office.
The article by the aged legislator
is significant in that he has been an
active church worker since boyhood
and that he is famed for his stand, at
all times, for right. The article is
also significant in that the Rev.
Charles E. Stater, pastor of the First
Methodist Episcopal church, Clarks
burg, recently refused the Women of
the Ku Klux Klan the privilege of
using the church for a funeral. Al
thosgh Mr. Morris’ home is near
Clarksburg, it is not known whether
his article is directed at the Rev. Mr.
Stater or not. Mr. Morris is not con
nected with the Klan in any manner.
Sabhath Breaking
The aged .Vriter opens his article
with a discussion of Sabbath desecra
tions and infidelity. He shows how
the Klan is endeavoring to remedy
these evils. The article follows:
“The Christian church was built on
a sure foundation; being founded by
Jesus Christ himself upon tbe ‘Rock
of Ages,’ and it will remain Invulner
able so long as its enemies are not
allowed to undermine its foundation
by destroying the main pillars which
support it.
‘‘The chief pillar, upon which the
church depends for its life, is the
Holy Sabbath. Destroy the sanctity
of the Fabbath day, as certain sects
are attempting to do now, the doors
of the churches will soon be closed;
for—with the partial paralysis of the
Sabbath day is it is today, some pas
tors of the rural churches are preach
ing to empty pews, while some oth
ers have closed their, doors for lack
of support. In using the term "Sab
bath day” I mean to include any day
set apart as a Sabbath, whether it be
the first or the seventh day of the
week.
World Creeps In
‘The church or other Christian or
ganizations, which are allowing them
selves to be assimilated bv the world
ly amusement clubs which do a large
financial business on the Sabbath day
had better close their church doors
than to allow Satan to use them for
his headquarters. The idea that God
will accept of hilarious worldly
amusement on a Sabbath day in lieu
of religious worship, is a preposter
ous subterfuge that will not stand in
the judgment of the bar of God.
“When God said ‘Remember the
Sabbath day to keep it holy,’ and de
creed that we should do no manner
of work on that day, it is unthink
able that He would uphold any as
semblage of persons to engage in any
hilarious, noisy demonstration, where
gambling, cursing and drinking is in
dulged in to excess often resulting
in fistic encounters; and where hun
dreds of dollars are collected at the
gates. Our courts and court officers
may pass it on, and allow such assem
blages to function in violation of our
statute laws, but God will not hold
them guiltless.
‘Then another source of destruc
tion to the Christian church which is
insidious in its work, is this propa
ganda being sent broadcast by the in
fidel class, and emanating from some
of our theological seminaries, col
leges and universities, contradicting
the Bible, and making some of our
weaker minds believe we are mere
animals, and our foreparents be
longed to the monkey tribe.
( hurrli Essential
“But as what I have written in a
previous article upon that phase of
the subject, will take no more space
at this time. But let me add in con
clusion, the Christian church is es
sential to the prosperity of any na
tion. The Sabbath and the Bible are

GAINESVILLE. FLA., Varch 24. I\
is an interesting but not surprising
fact, that the principles of the great
American order, the Knights of tha
Ku Klux Klan, are gaining headway
at the University of Florida, at
Gainesville. Many of the splendid
young men now students of tne uni

movement is now on foot to estab

In this Klan the young men will be

of the order; and if they are not
prejudiced, through selfish
they will see that they are fighting
