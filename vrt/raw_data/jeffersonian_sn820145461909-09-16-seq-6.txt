O, QUIT! HUSH UP!
Dear Mr. Watson: —I do think you
are the meanest man I ever knew. I
believe you are the meanest man in
the world. If you don’t let up on
your efforts to make us think, some
of us will become desperate, hysteri
cal, mad. Don’t you know we don’t
want to think? It hurts. We South
ern folks are not used to thinking.
We have been accustomed to let other
people do oui’ thinking so long that
our thinking faculties are atrophied,
and gone out of business. We South
erners are conservative. How cruel
you are to keep bothering us! Please
give us a rest. To think requires ex
ertion, requires the exercise of our
faculties that have been dormant for
years. Requires work. Please quit
pestering us. We are tired of your
everlasting provocations. What do
we care about tariff schedules, free
lumber, free hides? What do we
care how our Congressmen vote? Os
course THEY understand their busi
ness. We elected THEM to attend
to THAT business. Don’t bother US
with it. We are conservatives, “safe
and sane.” We have no use for logic
—can’t use it in our business. As
for books and editorials on “politics
and economics,” they only serve to
annoy us, or make us angry. We
Southerners are a proud and haughty
people, anyway. Os course, we are
always right. Can you improve per
fection? Then why continue your
everlasting agitations? Logic wearies
us. Give us rhetoric. Give us long
worded platitudes about Southern
greatness, and we will applaud you to
the skies.
Why “go on” so much about For
eign Missions? Don’t the preachers
know all about that? Haven’t they
studied that all out? What have we
to do with THAT, except to furnish
the “spondulix?” You are crazy, old
man—working yourself to death, try
ing to make us think, and we are not
going to do it. So hush up! That’s
all.
Your friend,
L. C. ALLEN.

Ed. Comment: This reminds us of
a letter received some months ago.
A friend related how he had tried to
get a storekeeper to subscribe to The
Jeffersonian, which he had been
reading. “No,” said the storekeeper,
“I don’t want to take that paper.”
“Why?” inquired our friend. “It
works you,” answered the store
keeper. The s—k wanted to be left
alone, not “worked.”
THEY REFUSED TO GIVE ANY
THING TO FOREIGN
MISSIONS.
We had a children’s day at the
Red Land School House recently.
Several were chosen to speak on For
eign Missions. Mr. T. H. Smith, a
People’s party man (who thinks
there isn’t another man like you and
never will be), was among them, but
it leaked out that he was opposed to
the present system. A few leaders
decided that Mr. Smith should not
speak, but three-fourths of the peo
ple said he should, and he opened
their eyes with a speech worth hear-
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
ing and nearly all the crowd went
with him when he asked for contri
butions to Home missions, but not a
penny was collected for Foreign mis
sions. Very truly,

DR. PAUL WAKEFIELD’S LETTER
The Jeffersonian.
Your editorial of July 15th on
“What ‘We Missionaries’ Concealed”
has been forwarded to me with re
quests for explanation.
There are three statements credit
ed me in the article copied from
the Crawfordsville, Ind., paper. They
are these: That “more women mis
sionaries are degraded by the Chi
nese men than there are Chinese
converted.” That the murder of
Elsie Siegle “has uncovered the sys
tem oi personal religious instruction
which is almost universal in Chinese
missions.” That the missionaries
had known these things and “kept
them covered up.”
Now I have not seen the Craw
fordsville paper, but these points
credited to me are exactly the re
verse of what I said. What I did say
was this: That in China in our work
we never have such troubles. The
women missionaries go and come
freely, conforming to the customs of
the land. I have never known or
heard of such a trouble as this in
New York. Further than this, in
China the women work only among
women and men among men. I
have never known of “individual re
ligious instruction” being given by
one of the opposite sex.
Again I called attention to the
fact that the Mission Societies HAVE
FOR YEARS PROTESTED, and do
now protest, against this type of
“Fashionable Slumming.” “Some
American girls go crazy over Orien
tal men.” In the name of “Mis
sions” they take liberties they would
never take with their own people.
There is not a Mission Society that
sanctions such a work. Any one who
will take the trouble to look up the
methods of the Mission Societies will
find their work is sane, properly
managed, adapted to the race among
whom the work is done, and is effec
tive. Such men as President Taft,
Hon. Jas. Bryce, Hon. Chas. Denby
are not missionaries, but have seen
the work and believe in it.
Finally, let us look at this affair
in New York. The young lady be
comes infatuated with a young man.
She writes him kitten love notes,
goes to his private rooms in a Chop-
Suey joint (very often these are
gilded brothels) and rejects him for
another lover. At best the girl in
vited trouble—and it is unfair to
judge the Chinaman any more se
verely than you would an American
citizen.
I am at a loss to understand the
spirit of a reporter who would so
misquote me. But lam quite as sur
prised that such a paper as The Jef
fersonian should copy or credit such
a report. On its face it is false. No
mission could exist six months un
der the conditions you seem willing
to credit. How you could conceive
American women going into such
work is more than I can understand.
I feel sure, had you known of the
Zsl>e 'Jeffersonian
work, or thought of the criticism of
our women missionaries your article
implied, you would never have print
ed it. I hope you will do all in your
power to correct the matter.
Yours truly,

STILL IN THE RING.
Dear Tom: —I have been thinking
for some time of writing you to let
you know how I appreciate your
publications.
I am one of the old guard and
never tire of reading your editorials.
They are food for me, and I get more
information from them than from
all other sources.
Your articles on the Foreign Mis
sions question are the best I have
ever seen, and to the unprejudiced
mind they can not fail to carry con
viction. The way you have “laid to
rest” the much disturbed parsons is
amusing. I am quite sure the For
eign Missions subject will not be the
great “hobby,” as it has been. I no
tice much is being said now of Home
Missions.
Well, Tom, it does me good to
know we common people have such
an able, fearless advocate. When I
think how you have been abused,
misrepresented and hounded down
by the very ones, many times, that
you were trying to help, I do not
understand how you have kept up
the fight.
I believe your Jeffersonian Club
plan for organization is the correct
one. By this method fusion, which
I detest, above all things, will be
impossible. We don’t need the
Bryans, Livingstons and Butlers any
more. I had rather fight it out and
die without going into power than
to sacrifice principle. It does not
discourage me to be in the minority;
it is better to be right than to have
all things and be wrong.
Always count me “one.”

WANTS US TO CRITICISE POETRY"
My Dear Mr. Watson:—Pardon my
presumption and take time to read
carefully my enclosed efforts at poet
ry, notwithstanding their uninvit
ing shape. I want your criticism,
favorable or unfavorable. My ob
ject is to find a patron, for what is
a poet without his Augustus or
Mycenas? I’m tired of waiting for
the world to discover me; my only
hope is to put myself boldly in the
path of some one on whom the
world’s eye is already riveted and
through him discover myself to the
world—that is, if I can get his at
tention. America herself might have
remained unknown but for butting
in between Columbus and his object.
Originality is not allowed by small
minds; originality means you have
ideas which nobody else can under
stand, and in a country town peo
ple s intellects, like their manners,
must be on a level. To drown origi-
nality and to bring about a unifica
tion of thoughts and opinions, and
that not of the highest order, it seems
to me, is what the community is try
ing to accomplish with the individual
in these days of uniform text books,
uniform methods of instruction, In
ternational Sunday School Lessons,
missionary societies, cradle rolls,
woman’s clubs, etc., etc., etc. Are
not our unifying educational forces
like shoe-peg machines cutting into
pegs of the same shape stalwart
original oaks and insignificant bushes
of the gooseberry variety? Are we
not ruining timber suited for the
ship of state by running it through
mills that turn out a finished product
every one alike in form regardless
of substance?
But I’m getting morbid. “The hit
dog yelps,” so they say. I’ve been
hit —hit hard. The editor of our
county paper tells me that his read
ers don’t like my “stuff,” and turns
down my gratis contribution, giving
his space to a preacher who pub
lishes ’ God Rules The Storm,” three
columns, to prove that the cyclone
which demolished things at Cuth
bert was in a direct answer to
prayer.
In explanation let me say I am at
Pond, eight miles east of
come into my tent to read and write.
A rat’s nest of old papers attracted
my attention, and in reading them
over I caught the idea that has found
expression in this letter.
Hoping no harm is done your pa
tience and that my signature will
cause you pleasant recollections of
an old friend who rejoices in your
success in life,
Sincerely,
OLD FRIEND.
July 30, 1909.
Note: There are just two things
that I won’t do:
(1) Anything that pertains to the
sphere of feminine strenuosity,—
such as sewing on buttons, patching
the pants, cooking the victuals, mak
ing the bed, sweeping the house,
washing dishes, milking the cow, set
ting the hen, doctoring a sick chick
en, dressing children, and churning.
These are not meant to exclude such
other things as by immemorial cus
tom belong to the woman’s depart
ment.
(2) Read poetry which is doubt
ful even in the eyes of the man who
wrote it, and which even a country
editor rises into insurrection against.
(This is a joke,—but the other
one isn’t.)
A DISGRACE TO OLD NICK.
Dear Sir:—l will send you the
money to extend my subscription to
your most valuable magazine and
weekly Jeffersonian, both one year,
and your knife and shears, and the
remainder of the money please use
in the work as you think best; $3.00.
I do not know when my time is out,
but please extend one year from that
time.
I am, or was, a Union soldier and
I am 65 years old, but that don’t mat
ter so the great reforms you are
working for have great success. And
I do think that the reorganization
