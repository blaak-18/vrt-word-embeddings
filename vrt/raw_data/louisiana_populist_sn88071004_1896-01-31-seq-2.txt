I 'Address to thSe People's Party of
" Louisliana
iy Its state Central Committee.
Confronted with the responsibili
r ty of completing a State ticket on
which our State convention left
r. one vacancy and filled other places
temporily, resignations from which
are placed in our hands, your com
0o mittee is forced to recognize the
w following situation in our party.
From the first move in this cam
paign until the platform of our
_ convention had been unanimously
r: adopted and the naming of our
ticket begun, our party through
its press, its speakers and its offi
cial announcements had declared
the necessity of securing an ELEC
SnoT in Louisiana before any prin
pciple could be expressed by the vo
ters of our State.
By the same evidences and by
our platform, our party has been
and is unanimously committed to
the necessity of and determination
to make this fight for the right
" of suffrage upon lines so broad
that every political element in our
State opposed to the present sys
tem of fraud, debauchery and mor
al degredation of the people, can
unite with us in sweeping from
power the present regime of cor
ruption.
That after this policy had been
outlined in our convention, com
plications and misunderstandings
arose from a want of frankness
and fair dealing among the mem
bers of that convention, as well as
among other elements that were
being considered in making up a
ticket.
- That not only did these misun
derstandings determine that part
of our ticket which has since re
signed, but affected the selection of
the head of our ticket also, and
have since resulted in open oppo
sition to such ticket by a large
element in own ranks, as well as
failure to meet the approval of
any element outside our party, but
co-operating with us.
In this awkward and trying situ
ation your committee, fully reali
aing their responsibility and the
supreme importance of harmony
and united, vigorous action, and
after careful and due deliberation,
have decided without a dissenting
vote that the only way to clear up
the situation and secure these much
desired ends, is to present a new
ticket to our party, subject to the
approval sad support of the par
tial ticket made by our conviction.
In presenting this new ticket we
are without authority further than
the exigenaies of the situation, and
therefore its success depends upon
the patriotism and loyalty to our
euse of those who compose our
first ticket, ad to the better jadge
meat and firmnems of our people.J
In selecting the peromnnel of this
ticket we have endeavored to a
we believe suceeded in protectiag
the satnmy and the rights of the I
People's party as a party, sad

Appointed by the State Central
Committee at its session in Alex

Sketch of Capt. Pharr.
The Times-Democrat.
Alexandria, Jan. 23.-Capt. J.
N. Pharr is one of the wealthiest,
as well as one of the best-known
sugar planters in the State, being
a man of striking personal appear
ance and somewhat eccentric in his
manner and lmethods. His integ
rity and honesty of purpose are
unquestioned, and he stands high
as a member of the Methodist
Church, having built an edifice at
Morgan City for the congregation
of that place, and being also one
of the largest contributors to the
Jackson Centenary College. Capt.
Pharr is also a Prohibitionist, but
whether a member of the national
order or favorable to local option
is an open question, those ol)po
sing his nomination taking the for
mer view and antagonizing him on
that, among other grounds, while
his friends say he favors local op
tion, and that is all the liquor ele
ment can ask within reason.
Capt. Pharr owns two sugar
plantations near Morgan City,
"Fairview," where he resides, and
"Glenwild," an adjoining place.
He is also owner of one-half of the
"Loizel" place, located near Jean
erette, in Iberia parish.
Capt. Pharr is a native of Ten
nessee or Kentucky, and came to
Louisiana some fifty years ago, and
began his career as manager of su
gar properties. After a time he
engaged in the "swamping" and
lumber business and the venture
proved successful. Twenty-five
or thirty years ago, before the
Morgan road had been completed
beyond Morgan City, he secured a
contract for carrying the United
States mail and freight and pas
sengers for the road from Morgan
City to St. Martinsville, the head
of navigation on the Teche. He
ran a daily line of boats in this
trade until the road was extended,
and made a fortune out of the con
tract. When the road was extend
ed he invested largely in sugar
properties. and has been one of the
few planters of the State who has
been successful. For a number of
years he was also engaged in the
sawmill business at Patterson,
Capt. Williams being his partner.
Capt. Pharr is looked upon as a
plain, unassuming man, big-heart
ed and philanthropic, but aside
from his prohibition proclivities,
he is not considered by many su
gar people either strong as a can
didateor possessed of those firm
and positive traits of character ee
sential to the safe management of
affairs of State.
His acceptance of the Populist
nomination will doubtless depend
upon the action of the sugar con
iention, which meets in this city
on Monday next. He has notified
those who havre inquired as to his
attitude on the question to this ef
feet. Should he be nominated by
the sugar people there is little
doubt but that he would be accep
table to the regular Republicans,
as his name hes met with more fa
vor in that quarter than any other
suggested in that connection. Capt.
PhWrr h~s never been a straightout
Demcrat, having afiliated with
the Whigs before the war. His
Republimoaism dates hack to the
Baine camagn, he having voted
for the Mai leader.
The above is the aeeount of our
nominee for Governor given by
the Times-Deinocrat, which is un'
friedly to oar esnoe, sadtherefore
tries to pdt ia a few weak points
which ae saif-eontrabtory.
This Moount of his polities
abowra that since the old Whig par
ty di.d Capt. Pharr ha been ia
depeadeat, voting whatever ticket
he deemed be, regardlessdo at prty.
This coupled with his high mor
Macam tw and terling.itntegrity
m a d~m, make him an ideal
aadte to lead People' par
ty to vi ,y l April.

members of the committee present.
A sub-conimittee of 5 was aip
pointed to ascertain how many rc
signations had been made, the pc
sition of each candidate of the
convention ticket, and to outline
the proper course for the whole
comnnttee.
Messrs. R. P. Johnson, R. D.

and J. E. 1)unn, were appointed,
and after a recess of one hour they
reported as follows :
"To the Chairman of the People's
Party State Central Commit
t tee and Members :
t "We, the members of your hon
Sorable Ixy, appointed for the
a purpose of conferring with the

leave to report :

- or ; J. B. Kleinpeter, Auditor:
- A. T. Nelson, Treasurer, and the
D nominnation of an Attorney (;Gne
e ral, left vacant by the action of tilhe
- State convention. In regard to
- the nomination for Governor, we
call attention to the fact that the po
r sition is being antagonize.! by many
of the prominent men in our par
I ty and by some of its organs, and
recognizinmg his patriotism and his
I earnest desire for the victory of
- the principles of our platform in
April, we believe that in the inter
- est of harmony and success he will
) acquiesce in and heartily support
I the action of this committee in
- placing a new man at the head of
J our ticket and the consequent co:n
I pletion of such a ticket as will rep
I resent all the opposition to the
a present administration, thus car
Srying out the manifest will of our
1 State convention as expressed in
i our platform and all the earlier
I and more deliberate actions of our
party. We would theretore sur
gest the appointment of a commit
I tee to issue an address to the peo
Sple naming candidates for all places
on the ticket subject to the final
Sdeclination of Mr. Booth.
"R. P. Johnson,
"RH. D. Wilde.
"J. A. Tetts,
"W'. D. Gooch,
"J. E. Dunn.
The report was unanimously
adopted, after full and free dis
cussion.
Nominations were then declared
in order and the new ticket was
then made as indicated in the ad
dress of the committee which ap.
pears elsewhere in this issue.
Messrs. J. T. Howell, J. H.
Crawford and J. E. Dunn, were
appointed as a committee, to in
lude the chairman andi secretary,
Ito prepare the address setting forth
the work of the committee which
appears elsewhere.
e committee then adjourned
subject to call.
H. L. BRIAN,
J. A. T'eTr, Chairman.
Secretary.
Already the rabid Democratic
papers have commencet to sympa
Ithite with and defend Mr. Booth.
Just as we expected; if they can
keep Mr. Booth in the race they
might split off a few votes, and
they no doubt would share their
campaign boodle with him for that
purpose, but it will be a sorryin
r#estment.
Mr. Booth now has an oppor
tunity to show his good sense and
patriotism and thus redeem him
self with his people, or to continue
m his way downward to oblivion
sal destruction to himself.
