President Cleveland's annual
message to Congress delivered
Monday, spends words to the
amount of at least 3 columns of
this paper, on the Cuben question,
and when you get through It you
know quite as much as you did.be
fore.
One of the most important du
tL-- for active Populists to per
form right now is to see that
every Populist takes a Populist pa
per. The mixed condition of af
fairs In the late campaign renders
this necessary. If they take a
Populist paper they will see where
we stood in the fight, what we
gained, and that the fight is to go
right on so far as our party is
concerned. The Louisiana Popu
list is one of the best, and its
friends should make special efforts
now to extend its circulation, and
thus increase its useefulnoes.
The People's party in the cam
paign just closed, elected 5 govern
or--Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado,
Washington and South Dakota; 4
U. S. Senators--Idaho, Washing
ton, Kansas, South Dakota and
prohably North Carolina, 26 Con
ressmen--Kansas 6, Nebrask 5, I
North Carolina 5, California 2, 8.
Dakota 9, Colorado 1, Alabama 1,
Idaho 1, Waahington 1, Nevada 1,
Missouri 1, and a delegate from
Oklahoma. Besides this, we have i
s U. 8. Senators from Nevada,
1 from 8. Dakota, 1 from N. Car
olima, and 1 from Nebraska. Pret-,

list will me in these gaimns much 1

ing elsen here in this issue, and ask
their immlediate action thereon.
The people in 3 wards of this
parish have suffered terribly from
the effects of the drouth--so much
so that our Police Jury wisely ap
propriated $1000 for their relief,
Sard this was entirely insufficient, I
o and will be exhausted before Jan
uary 1st.
- Even if no donation is asked for,
n- the low rate of purchase and free
transportation which the commit- 1
Itee has secured would enable these I
sufferers to obtain corn at perhaps
less than 20 cents per bushel.
Do not let these people suffer by
our negligence after the means of
w relief have been provided.
The Register HIas no Right.
............ La., Nov. 23, 1896.
t Mr....... Minden, La.
Dear Sir :
I We are in receipt of your favor
d of the 22nd inst., to our Mr.-,
e asking for an opinion as to publi
f cation of final proof.
T'he U. S. Land laws are very
' explicit in giving the homestead
settler the right, not only to choose
the paper in which his notice of in
tention to make final proof shall
be published, but gives him-the
right to make his own contract
with and pay the publisher direct
ly.
Yt "But settlers are not to be de
~prived of the right to make their
own contracts for publishing noti
ces of intention to make final proof
and to make payment therefor di
rectly to the publisher of the pa
e per, after the notice has been pre
e pared by the Register, and the
paper designated by him, on pre- l
sen ting to the Register a statement
from the publisher or his agent
that the money for the payment of t
s said notice has been paid to or do
g posited with said publisher," Cir- r
I cular from the Gen'l. Land office, i
Feb. 6, 1892, page 61, and also
Copp's American Settlers Guide,
page 60, and Copp's Land Owner, a
vol. 10 page 227.
Truly yours,
I Attorneys at Law. t
The above letter is from a firm t
of able jurists and it will make c
- Mr. Phillips ashamed to know that ,
,he has been acting so wrong, pro- s
vided he has one spot of manhood *
left in him. Il
For a settler who has to pay for c
,the publication of his final proof t
I notice, to be forced to pay five or a
a six dollars when he can get it done c
for three, is a shame and the good o
people of the country should wait
upon Mr. Phillips at Natchitoches c
and give him a sound reckoning
Sfor forcing them to such measures o
a beosue he har, as is claimed by him e
the right to designate the paper. tI
The law says, "the Regterhas a
the right to designate the papert
closest to the land," etc., but
where there are two papers pub- p
lished in the town it interferes with t
his right, and the settler should be it
allowed to manage his own busi- o
ness. There is one consolation in
this matter, such abominable men i,
will soon be removed to a hack
seat, and honest men who are will
Sing to guarantee freedom to every p
,man alike, will take their places.
This is another specimen my read- d
ers, of ring democracy, and the S
acts of the Register of lands at a
[Natehatoehes would hit a demoerat
just as hard as anybody else and p
deprive him of the right to drive ti
the best trade for himself poe
sible in the event he could do bet
ter with a Populist paper. It
iwould psa all farmers to give this tl
thing senrous thought and learn u
aother lesson from partisan poli- n
ties.-Beaner of Liberty. 51

To the Citizens of the
Drouth Stricken Parish
es of North Louisiana.
Tih Governor having appointed
the undersigned coIInittee, to ljir
chase and distiibute corn among
the destitute ipeople of the drouth
stricken section of North Louisi
ana, and having l)laceld t;5,tON, to
our credit in the State Treasury
for that purpose, and it being the
desire of the Governor, to apply
this fund to the relief of the great
est number of needy people,-we
therefore believe, that owing to the
very low price of corn in the grain
country, and the very liberal
freight rates made by the railroad
lines for transportation ; the treat
est number of people will be re
lived by applying a part of the
available funds to the payment of
all or part of the freight on corn
which may be purchased by the
consumer, thereby reducing the
rcost of the corn materially ; which
F will enable a large number of peo
ple to provide for themselves, and
those dependent upon them. By
this policy the extreme cases of
destitution will be very greatly
reduced. The balance of the funds
will be used to relieve those who
are without means or credit. We
therefore earnestly request the
good people and the press of North
Louisiana to co-operate with us in
carrying out this policy. We re
commend that a mass meeting be
canvassed in each parish, to be
called by the members of the leg
islature thereof, at an early day,
for the purpose of appointing a
Central Parish Committee of not
less than three citizens, whose du
ty it will be to co-operate with us
in ascertaining the extent of the
destitution and to make the dis
tribution in their respective par
ishcs.
The Parish Central Committee
will also appoint a sub-committee
in each ward, whose duty it will
be, to make a canvass of their res
pective wards, and ascertain the
exact condition of each destitute
family, and report in detail to the
Parish Central Committee, accord
ing to the rules laid down by this
committee, which will be furnished
to the Parish Committee. These
reports must be examined and ap
proved by the Central Committee
and forwarded to this committee,
where they will be compiled with
similar reports from other parish
es, and a pro-rata of the available
funds, will be invested for their
relief, and shipped to the Central
Parish Committee for proper dis
tribution.
All persons who wish to avail
themselves of the privilege of pur
chasing corn under the arrange
ments above mentioned, must do
so through this committee. And
all purchasee must be in car load
lots, and the necessary funds to
cover each order, must be depo i
ted in the Ouachita National Bank
of Monroe, to the credit of this
committee, although they may
concentrate their funds, and ap
point any local merchant to pur
chase for them.
This committee will fix the price
on each car of corn to cover the
cost and at which it must be sold
to actual consumers, and only in
such quantity as will meet the ac
tual necessity in each case.
No speculation whatever will be
permitted on corn purchased by
this committee, and shipped with
its agreement with the railroad
companies.
Appreciating the responsibility
imposed upon us, and desiring to
perform the duties to the satisfac
tion of the Governor, and the peo
ple of the State, we earnestly in
vite the representatives of the
dro'ith stricken parishes in the
State legislature to take special
supervision of the appointment of
suitable committees in their ree
pective parishes, who will see that
the bounty of the State is proper
ly applied, and that no imposition
is racticed.
,or the purpose of transacting
the business of this committee, we
wililat once open an office at Mon
roe, La., and all communications
should be addressed to
URIAH MTILLSAPS,
Chairman State Belief Committee.

The money question is practi
cally settled. According to late
reports from the Transvaal gold
Solds there isno use to clamor for
free silver coinage, or even for
greenbaclks unless they are issued
for convenience sake and every
dollar has 100 cents in gold back of
it The Bothechilds have made
gold the money of the world and
now when they have got the thinmg
"cinched" so there's no backing
out of it the merciful Almighty
is steppinr in and furnishabing the
gold. The recent:report of Dr.
George F. Becker, of the United
States geologial surver , wlr hes
jus returned from making an g -
aminatitn of the Tl'ransvaal gold
tieMs, is ilnteresting, ill tl;ii cn
nct:i,,c while, if what he sa," is
tri:e. it 'Erct 'lange in the worI's
in, y s1e',mis inn i:ent. In this
e's irt D)r. licker ,> ' that '"'with
in lilt'tein miles of Johaunnesluro ,
on what is called the main reef se
ries, there is an amount of gold,
fracticallv in sight, estimated to
be wor'th ";o,(t ,tH,,0t),00.u or nearly
as much as the entire volume of
gold coin now in the world. I say
'practically in sight,' because the
gold is extraordinarily uniform, as
uniform as coal in an ordinary de
posit, as shown by shafts which
have been sunk to a depth of 1,'s;
feet, and diamond drillings which
have gone much further."
It is generally supposed that the
gold deposit to which Dr. Becker
refers is about fifty miles in length.
Dr. Becker quotes another expert
as declaring that "instead of being
thirty miles long-the region now
in sight-the reef is practically
1,200 miles long, except that in
the rest of the region later depos
its, like coal, have come in over the
gold."
The effect of such an immeasu
reable quantity of gold "in sight"
upon the finances of the nations is
past all computation. In referring
to the matter The Outlook says:
"It would be curious, as well as
instructive, if the Almighty should
take this means of proving that He
has the power, which has been
denied Him, of making a silver
dollar equal to a gold one, and at
the same time teaching us that
questions of gold and silver, about
which we set into such heats, are
not the most vital ones, and are by
no means left so exclusively to our
settlement as we have imagined."
Think of it!
Twelve hundred miles of solid
gold deposit!
Within twenty years from now
it will be selling on the streets at
fifteen cents a bushel!
And the goldites will have to
take it!
It is in the bond!
They put it there!
'"Man proposes but God dispo
ses!
It is the money of the world!
Contracts are drawn made paya
ble in gold!
Bonds are stipulated to be paid
in gold !
It is the measure of value!
"As ye measure so shall it be
measured unto you."
They have to take it!
No repudiation of the contract!
It s the bond!
The object was to enslave the
people!
"1 will repay saith the Lord."
Gold, the oppressor in the hands
of tyrants, becomes the deliverer
in the hands of the people!
"Go to now, ye rich men, weep
and howl for your miseries that
shall come upon you!"
"Your riches are corrupted and
your garments are moth eaten!"
"Your gold and silver is cank
ered; and the rust of them shall
be a witness against you, and shall
eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye
have heaped treasures together for
the last days!"
"Behold the hire of the laborers
who have reaped down your fields,
which is of you kept back by fraud,
crieth; and the cries ot them which
have reaped are entered into the
ears of the Lord of Sabsoth!"
"Ye have lived in pleasur on
the earth, and been wanton; ye
have nourished your hearts as m
a day of slaughter!"
"The earth is the Lord's, and
the fullness thereof!"
If told gets down to 10 cents a
bushel they must take it, for it's
in the bond.-Morgan's Buzz-~iw.
