MARcH to, 1894.
Gazette atteks upoh its sec
today,. .haiving been es
just one yea ago. Our
a l the most critical period
career of a country news
is past, and we may, with
,look forward with the an
on of a prosperous future.
SWe believe the time has come to
our most sincere thanks to
t-Eple of the town and parish of
SLafayette for the manifestation of
ei. r good will and substantial evi
:'.e. ce of their -appreciation of the
S.urseof the paper. And it affords
.*.; 3 u¢atch pleasure to say that it has
: een self-supporting since its initial
nti: ber, the business increasing
from week to week, slowly 'tis true
'but steadily. Our advertising col
m sns are fairly well filled, our cir
cu lation is growing, reaching every
part of the parish, and our job press
fins been kept quite busy. We have
indeavored to direct the course of
the paper toward the upbuilding of
every section of the parish, with no
special favoritism to any particular
part, and it has always been our
aim, perhaps fruitless, to promote
every projected enterprise that
promised prosperity to the people.
Again thanking our friends for
their support during the past year,
we hope that we may always deserve
a continuance of their liberal patron
.age in the future.
Hon. N. C. Blanchard will be
Hon. Don Caffery's mate in the Sen
ate, Governor Foster having ap
pointed him to succeed Senator
White. The new appointee un
doubtedly has the ability and ener
gy to make a useful member of the
Senate. It is hoped and expected
that he will use his great abilities
Sand experience acquired by long
service in the lower house in assist
ing Senator Caffery in the present
fight for Louisiana's leading indus
try. He has said that will stand by
sugar to the last and we believe
that he will.
The Lake Charles Press sizes up
the tramp printer nuisance about
correct. It considers work and
money given to this class of vaga
bouds as being put to no better use
than is the meal of victuals fed to a
criminal just before he is hung.
Jennings Times.
This is rather hard on that much I
abused individual known as the
"tramp printer." We'll wager a new I
Stetson with the editor of the Times ]
that he never saw a real tramp-print
er,-the genuine article, the profess
ional tramp printer who never prints. t
He is an agreable fellow, a whole- I
souled, companionable gentleman, s
who would rather ride in a stock t
car full of mules than be a traitor r
to the profession and condescend I
to travel in the kingliest Pullman. t
And an other thing, you ought to i1
consider, brother, is the feelings of t
some of our leading politicians and t
editors, who use to be "'typo- t
graphical tourists." Don't be so a
cruel on the poor tramp, but on the t
contrary, mourn because he is fast C
disappearing and with a few more e
type-setting machines he will be a
thing of the past. c
It is said that Mrs. Mary Lease of ;
Kansas, once in the heat of a po- "
litical discussion denounced her op- h
ponent as "no gentleman." The g
dreadful thing retorted: "Neither
are you."

-a a tba ugh:,ystems of schools in%&%
parish may be possessed; yet there
are causes which interfere seriously
with the. eiciency of the schools.
One of these is tardiness, a child
- comes after school begins or is late
.- at one of the recesses and thus
rr misses a lessont. Many parents
d think that one lesson missed does
;- not matter; but it does. Explanations
h and demonstrations to the class are
;- lost to the scholar and he lacks just
that much of being thorough. Losing
o a number of recitations increases
o his deficiency, and it does not take
4 him long to be hopelessly behind;
f this proves a great trouble to the
1- teacher, while it takes unnecessarily
a much of his time which ought to be
,s devoted to the class as a whole.
,s Losing whole days from school ag
tl gravates this trouble and proves
g much more detrimental to the pupil.
e But the most serious hindrance to
t- horoughness, especially in'country
schools, is of having too many
y classes. For instance, suppose a
s teacher is required to teach 6 grades
e only. That means at least 28 classes.
,f Estimating z5 minutes to a class,
if and that is as little time as a class
o should have, and it takes 7 hours,
.r of continuous teaching without the
r loss of a minute. Seven hours is
e entirely too long too confine children.
t Besides, the time allowed for each
recitation is not sufficient. It follows
r then that the number of grades to be
, taught in our ordinanry school with
e but one teacher should be limited
to 5 grades at most if effective work
is to be done. But 5 grades is not
enough, and as there are not sufficient
funds to employ two or more
teachers in each school, it becomes
r needful that a school should be estab
lished which would give an advanced
course to those desiring to continue
their education. Such a school is
s the High School. Its object is to
g supplement the schools of the parish,
- and at the same time offer to ambi
t tious scholars something be)ond
their home school.

Less Talk and More Work.
ROYVILLE, LA., Feb. 6, :894.
t To the Editor of The Gazette:
I Latterly we have read so many
- theories and suggestions, in both
your paper and the Advertiser, until
our eyes burn and our ears ring with
it as regards to the parish roads.
Let ns have a rest-a little less talk
and a grain more of genuine good
r will would go a good deal farther in
promoting the yet mooted road
- question. We are not unfallible, by
a long way, however, we believe
the matter at issue rests entirely
upon our Police Jury. Therefore,
we would suggest to the members of
the honorable body, as we think it
not out of place here, to pass a law
by which every proprietor is made
to pay a tax to the fullest extent of
, his possessions-from a silver spoon
to lands on bank notes, moneys in
banks, mortgaged notes, etc. Let
there be a committee appointed,
whose duty it shall be to see that
the law is vigorously enforced.e
Give them the power to swear in
everybody-one and all-for their
full value and leave no possible
chance for an excuse or "a lie out,"
say for the next four years to come,
without he or they pay the full I
penalty for it. At all events for
humanity's sake, if fornothing else,
give us good roads, at any price.
