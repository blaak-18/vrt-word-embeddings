We desire to call your attention
to the ninth annual meeting of the
Louisiana State agricultural Society
which will take place at Natohito
ches on January 23, 24 and 25,
1895.
A large and representative body
of planters and farmers of this
State is desired at this meeting.
To accomplihsh this every agricul
tural organization, including plan
ters' associations, farmers' clubs,
granges andl unions are earnestly
requested to send delegates.
The committee on programme
has appealed to the police juries of
the various parishes to send two
or more planters or farmers as del
egates from each parish. Favor
ableaction of each police jury is
not only most earnestly desired,
but will meet with the honest ap
proval of every friend of agricul
ture.
The present financial aondition
of our agriculturists calls for seri
ous thought and deliberation.
Low prices of our staple products,
unreliable labor, soil depletion and
high money rates have deprived
our profession of much of its prof.
ts and all of its pleasures. Chan
ges in our methods and perhaps
in our crops are imperative, and
what these shall be can be best
determined by the combined wis
dom of assembled conventions of
our leadiag men. It s therefore
earnestly desired that farmers and
opleteus from all rts of the State

Great Gold Discovery.
The discovery of gold in Wall
street is the colossal event of the
closing years of the century" It is
now being brought to the surface
. easily, without shafts, picks, shov
I, els or even washing pans, at the
rate of $100,000,000 a year. Noth
ing but a little taper and printer,s
ink are necess'ry for the operation,
The ease of the thing is far more
marvelous than the fairy tales fold
Sof the steam shovels work in the
Mebesa mountains. We are addl
Sing to our natinal stock of gohl at
the rate of nearly $2,00,(0K) a
week, and the Wall street diggings
have only just begun to be worked.
r.Tinon in the woods of Athens

discovered the gold he hated.

Y ves of H all street, has pressed the
SBenedict button and discovered
the gold he lovea. Why talk any
more of Ilamiiton striking the
Srock of the national resources and

Far grander is the spectacle of
" Cle'~and striking Wall street for
a kin, and streams of gold rushing

New York. lec. 4.--Mrs. 1)rlinke li
wiler gave a jootlle dog tet party
yesterld;ay afterllloion at her palatial
residence in this city. It was in
Ihonor of the birthday of her favor
ite poodle dog. Hler log wore for
the occasioi an aelegant diamoni l
necklace costing several hundred i1
dollars. Very ornately prinltel in
vitations were disllalced to the
jiodile dogs :til pugs in good so
ciety. When the hour tifor the par s
ty arrived the street in the vicinity P
of the residence Was thronged ti
with grand equipages, in which the
Ilucky canines rode iIl state, walrml
ly wrapped in silk and satin blan
kets, blankets richly embroidered '
with lace and gold, with a coat of
arms appearing on most of them.
Each dog was accompanied by a
liveried colored attendent and all
the pharalipheralia of aristocratic
rank. The poodles and pugs
sipped mnilk from golden saucers.
The subject of founding a dog hos
pital was discussed.
Bridgport, Conn. l)c. 2.-Mrs.
Thomas Matthews. a poor womllan
living in Gregory street was eject
ed yesterday with her two children
one a babe, because she could not
I pay the rent.
4 When the sheriffs deputies came
she stood upon the sidewalk and
watched them carry out her scant
household furniture. Then leaving
her belongings upon the sidewalk,
and with the babe in her arms and
the other child clinging to her
sirits, she wandered up and down
Bridgport streets in the storm.
Ai passer-by noticed the babe in
the arms of the woman, and saw
that the little face was blue with
the cold. IIe called a policeman.
It was found that the woman was
insane. The mother and child
e were taken to the Emergency hos
pital. There it was found that the
babe was near to death from cold
r and hunger.
When the physicians undertook
to take the child from the moth
er's arms she made a hard fight to
retain it. At last, under the plea
that she was to be taken to her
mother, the mother and children
11 were got into a buggy and taken
e to the insane hospital.
eThe tollowing letter published
in the Mineola Courier represents
e in a fair degree the uses to which
public documents and seeds are

My Dear Sir.-Yours ot the 16th
of January is at hand, and I am
certainly glad to get it and get the
a information it contains.
I did not know when I sent out
I the maps and documents to the
men of Yantis that they were Ipo
uliste. They wrote me and re
. quested these documents, and I
usually respond to that sort of re
equests, unless there is some good
d reason for not doing so. I will
send to thie parties you nanme, Mr.
Mitchell, Mr. Criflin and Mr. Wil
Sson, documents and seed. and
would be very glad indeed to have
Syou seMnd me a list from that post
office giving me the names of dem
ocrats to whom I eoulhd send docu
t ments and seed; also give me the
Snames of third party lpeople, so I
Scan protect myself when I receive
these requcbts.
I have a request from N. B. Cum
r. mings and David O. Price, both of
tilti n at that plate IPleaso let Ini
luno.w who they are and whether
I ought to seil pa,;bers to them or
not. .\re they democrats?

thought that "W\e killed a bar."
110 yeon kilow tha;t your party
ciast 73,4iH) less votes thlan ill 18923
1)o you know that the Populist
vote was inicretased over ,800,001) in
the Ilst two years!
Here is the vote of all the par
ties inl the last two electionlls.
I)em. vote in 18.92, 3..51,4Mi
Rep. vote in 1892, 5.175,00.(
P. P. vote in 1892, 1,012,000
Prohibition vote in '92, 26:,00M)
D)em. vote in 189!, 4,100,01)0
Rep. vote in 1891, 3,100,000
1. P. P. vote ill 1894, 1.830,000(
Prohibition vote in'91, 2501,000
It will be seen that the D)emou
crats have lost more than a mil
holl votes, and the Prohllbitionist
13,000; while, strange to say, the
party which swept the country,
lost 73,000.
The brother will please notice'
that the Populist party is the only
one of the four which has increas
ed its strength.
a The Populist vote in 1892 was
:a paralyzer to the ohl party politic
r ians that the only comfort they
could extract from the situation
was the dolorous croak, "The Pops
n are all dead," and ,You can't do'
Sit again."
The Populist party has held its
million votes, at the recent elec
i tion, and when the true vote is
given it will be found that an ad
ditional million has been secured.
ie I can listen patiently and smil
d ilgly to all such silly political
croakers, when all they can say is'
k "Bet you can't do it again."
