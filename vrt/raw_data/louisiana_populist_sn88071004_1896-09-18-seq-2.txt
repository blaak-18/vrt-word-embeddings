THE SITU &TION.
An al,leeditorial f'rom the Non
colifol'lnit, healed "A Supreme
Mouieiit," hich al pieai' in :ioth
4*r column, is worthl tlhe careful
perusal oflvery Populist in Louisi
r. anli.
This editorial is descriptive of
iote general situation of the popu
II, list -delno atli fusion tlhroughoni
the count1ry, bult especially in Indi
ana. It also gives the very best
of reasons why Populists should
not consider a mere division of elec.
~ tors, which mleauns the support of
a the straight I)emotlratic ticket, but
should w ith-hold their support
front any collbination with the
Denimocrats until Sewall is with
drawn.
The situation in Iudi:lna so near
ly resembles that ill Louisiana and
the arguments advanced ill defend
ing that situation is such a comn
a llette defeise of the course of the
People's party in Louisiana, that
we take pleasure in giving nearly
two columnu to a repr(oduction of
the article above referred to.
Believing that the Populist vote
in Louisiana is necessary to the
success of the silver cause we have
C urged the Populists to stand firm
r in demanding the withdrawal of
7 Mr. Sewall, thereby vindicating
d the honor and preserving the iden
tity of the People's party.
There is no doubt of the fact
" that Populists in the doubtful
P States where their votes are need
s ed have it in their power to de
feat Mr. Sewall, elect Mr. Watson
and save the life of their party in
this critical hour ot its existence.
S Their party and their prosteri ty
will hold them responsible for a
I failure to do their duty in this cri
i sis.
Opelonsas, La., Sept. 13th. 1896.
Mr. II. L, Brian.
Dear Sir:-H-aving noticed
your call of the Special committee
of "Peoples Party" to meet at Al
exandria on the 24th, of this
month, to meet a similar commit
tee of the Democratic party, for
the purpose of seeing whether a
fusion of the two parties could be
accomplished. I think it in order,
that you or your committee should
have an idea what the sentiment of
the Peoples party in the 6th. con
gressional district is on that sub
jct.
The Peoples party of this dis
trict will not favor any actions of
the committee that would tend to
destroy the identity of our party
either national or State. The Peo
ples party of this district, is ten
fold stronger that it was at the
last election, So much stronger
has it grown in St. La.ndry and
Arcadia and.the surrounding par
ishes, notwithstanding the asser
tion of the Times-Democrat to the
contrary, that there is no doubts
in any one's mind, that a Populist
will represent the 6th. congres- a
sionaldistrict, in the next Con
gress.
It is also the sentiment of the
People's party of this district that
no fusion could be accomplished
with the D)emocrats unless, they
were to take down their nominee mn
the 4th. bth. and 6th. congression
al districts, and nominate or en I
dorse nominees of the People'st
party in these respective districts.
As we regard this as the only
marks of identity left to our party a
the election is over should a fusion a
be accomplished in this State. a

Vatndervoort's Letter.
)i Bl a Unite i Stan:, Mr. Siwall Can
I Be Forcted From the Ticket.
ul Iiior Nonconformist :
Si The treason to Watson, our sal
lant candidate for vice-president,
lhas been carried out in Nebraska.
t K:insas, Colorado. Idaho, Nevada
and all the west except Oregon andn
st Washington. We divide electors
kl in California and Montana, while
c. South Dakota gives them all to
of the democrats.
at In the south the Bryan demnocra
rt cy refuse to give us one single
i' elector, relying on their power to
h- stuff the ballot-hox andt ly false
counts steal electors in the solid
r- south. The conspiracy of the
lI, bourbon democracy in the south,
- the silver men in the mining states
- and traitors in Nebraska, Kansas
"' and Iowa is being carried out to
at destroy the People's party. In Ne
ly braska the Ilolcomb and Allen wing
of the People's party take the state
ticket and give the democrats four
straight electors and then they have
1e four others who will vote for Sc
wall without doubt. Howling
o about freeing the nation from for
eign rule, they have placed on the
electoral ticket a Swede, a German,
an Irishman, a Polander and a Bo
at hemian-or five out of eight.
al The democrats feel outraged at
I being compelled to swallow Ilol
comb and his satelites, but they
n had to do it to get the electors for
in Sewall, as all the Hlolcomb crowd
e. want is pie and plenty of it, and if
y Bryan should be elected they would
a demand still farther reward for
i- their treason. They have nomina
ted for congress a republican in
the third district who has never
l' left the party, a democrat in the
first and second and the immacu
,d late and only Greene in the sixth.
5e In the fourth and fifth we have
I- true People's party men, Judge
is Stark and Southerland. Such is
t- the condition here. The trade will
or be carried out down to county of
a ficers, and a People's party with
e eighty- five papers carrying Bryan
r, and Watson at their masthead sub
d mit to the infanmou sellout arrang
)f ed before the delegation went to
1- St. Louis. The Bryan democrats
polled less than 10,000 votes last
fall, and 1 honestly believe that
- the silver republicans- outnumber
f tlfem in the state. The republican
o Bryan men' have not been conceded
y one thing unless we call Judge
)- Maxwell a concession. It is all
t- democracy in the saddle. I was in
e Texas when the democratic state
r convention spurned and spit upon
d the Populist state committee when
they asked for a division of elec
tors. So it is all over the south.
e The purpose is to destroy the
5 People's party and put the south
tern bourbons in full control for
-another quarter of a century.
- They have disfranchised two-thirds
of the people by the infamous Mis
e sissippi and South Carolina con
t stitutions, and they propose to en
. act similar provisions in all the
y south. They are not honest in
a their advocacy of silver. They
- will betray the cause again as they
have in the past. The .great ques
a tion in the south is a fair ballot
i and an honest count and it will be
I sacrificed by the triumph of Bryan
and Sewall. For my part I will
a not support Sewall electors in the
state and will fight them in every
state where we have the power.
I will support Bryan and Wat
son electors but the cheat and swin
dle has been carried so far that all
- middle of the road Populists, if
a they want to preserve one iota of
their party, must at once demand
SSewall's withdrawal and that Bry
an shall at once accept our nomi- I
nation and fully dignify our party
-which has kept alive the cause of
silverfor ive years. I hope and]
trust that all People's party trait- i'
1ors like IHoleomb, Weaver, Taube- I
neck and every other one who are
before the people for ofice this fall I
Swill be ignomiously defeated. c
Not one single honest Populist t
Swill be recognized m this campaign. I
SNone but the Allens, Leases, J
Wearers,' and that claus have any a
standing with the Bryan democra- i
cy. i
d ..r ,.ll , n. It liv,"- tir t I;;, in tNell
dI despise, loathe and hate the
.s Bourbon demlc cracyV, and I have n~
to much desire to see the triumph of
o the battle for an honest ballot as I
have for free silver.
The plutoer its are in control of
Ie both the old parties. 1). B. Hill
o and Tammany have never support
e ed a candidate without a trade.
d 'We can force Sewall off the track.
SILet us all join hands in a revolt
that will compel it.

r Dear Sir and Friend:-I feel im
pelled under the circumstances sur
rounding us to write you a line
g Since the St. Louis convention I
am thoroughly convinced that it
Swould have been far better to have
, put out a full ticket of our own,
and we would not now he mixed
up with the Democrats as we are
It in this matter.
- Perhaps this of itself has misled
Y the Democrats into the belief that
' we want to go back into their par
d ty.
I believe that a more satisfacto
ry fusion could have been made
r with the Democrats, by putting up
a seperate ticket at St. Louis, thus
showma them that we were not
beggars by any means, and Bryan
and w atson would now be recog
nized throughout the Union, with
the forces opposed to monopoly
united as one man working for the
successs of our cause.
As it ism what do we see No
concert of action, each State mak
ing arrangements of its own in
reference to fusion, some swapping
off our electors for the State offi
cers, others dividing them and al
p ways giving Sewall the advantage.
I see you have called the Special
committee to meet the Democrats
t on the 24th, inst. I hope you will
r recognize nothing but a clean cut
[ Bryan and Watson ticket.
Nothing less than this will satis
o fy the Populists of Claiborne, and
l I think they are right.
n I think the sooner the Democrats
e realize that we are in earnest when
we make this demand the sooner
will it be conceded.
I know the Democrats can do
nothing in this fight without our t
aid and if they are in earnest for
reform and striving for it, they
will grant us what we have asked,
if not it is not worth while to lon
ger fool away time with them.
I think we have shown to the
world that we have all the while
been willing and anxious to do the
right thing in this matter, and if
Swe can't dothat we will do nothing.
I realized five years ago that the
Peoples Party would have to force I
by "bull-dog" eourage its recogni
tion here in the South and my
mind has not changed.
Hoping that your committee
will do the right thing for the
good of our party in this State. I
am as ever i
' Yours for success

If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 176 paces of laugh
provoking matter, and 40 full-pate
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
