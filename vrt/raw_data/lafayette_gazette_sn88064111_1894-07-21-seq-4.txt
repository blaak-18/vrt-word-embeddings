Various modes of washing and
styles of massage are glaimed to ben
efit the hair and cure it of ill color
and_ weak growths but for forked
ends, "snake tongues," as some women
call the splitting of the ends of the
i-air, there seems to be now but one
accepted remedy. This is "singeing."
To clip the ends every new moon was
the old custom. Every woman could
do it for herself, and in that act eon
sisted the entire scientific care of the
hair a decade ago. But it never was
very suecessful; the hair with a ten
deney to split went right on splitting.
Singeing generally stops the trouble,
Some of its advocates claim that the
old,igflorant method of clipping left the
little hollow tubes of the hairs open,
while singeing leaves them closed,
"'stopped" in a natural state. But this
is an exceedingly fine point of con
tention.
Singeing, unfortunately, cannot be
done by a woman for herself. Nor can
two women do it very satisfactorily
for each other, unless they happen to
be trained hair dressers.
Women who are in the habit of hav
ing their hair "attended to" advise the
singeing process once a month. Many
say that their own experience goes to
show that it acts upon the hair as
pruning does upon a plant-increases
its vitality and revives its growth.
This treatment is now given the hair
at all first-class hair-dressing estab
lishments here and abroad, while many
women have a standing appointment
with some favorite expert for treat
ment in her own dressing-room once a
month.
The approved process at one very
fashionable Parisian hair dresser's is
exceedingly simple, yet not safe in un
trained hands. The hair is loosened
and shaken out, and the maid runs
over it with a lighted taper, touching
all the projecting ends. A flash here
and a flash there and you are singed.
Then you are swathed in Turkish
towels-gently inclined over the bowl
COUNITESS rOTOCEI.
[Example of hair perfectly kept.]
with a warm spray turned upon your
head and anointed with cool, soapy,
scented things out of bottles. There
is more hot spray, more anointing,
still another spray, growing cooler and
cold. Then the hair is dried as well as
one towel will do it, which is not much,
as it is the latest theory that rubbing
pulls out the hair.
You then sit in front of a large tube
with a lamp at the lower end of it, a
curious arrangement for drying by hot
air. And the while this wartn wave
rushes by you the girl is manipulating
the hair-not rubbing it, but lifting
and separating it in a gentle massage,
and you grow deliciously drowsy, until
you need a cup of chocolate or some
thing more exhilarating to bring you
back to the subject of waves.
This treatment leaves every hair
light and individual, and the slight
waving gives the mass not compact
ness, but depth and mystery and a
decorative quality unknown to the
coiffures of the fashion plates. This
aureole quality, this natural human
look of the hair, is well shown in the
beautiful portrait of Countess Potocki.
Such well kept hair, if arranged in
the mode by a hair dresser who re
spected its texture and living beauty,
would not lose its decorative quality.
and a "bang" would never be needed
to soften the outline of the forehead.
Frequently in some conditions of the
body the entire pilose growth will be
affected in the form of forked ends,
each hair seeming to be of a different
length. the roughness and bristling
extending throughout the whole mass
of tresses. In these cases no treat
ment seems eficacious to eliminate the
forked tongue feature excepting rig
orous and systematic singeing.
The troublesome locks are uncoiled,
and a coarse comb is swiftly passed
through them. Then the hair is taken
in strands, beginning at the crown.
Each strand, in turn, is twisted as
tightly as it can be, over and over, and
held out stiff and straight from the
head. The surface of the twist is then
roughed up lightly with the comb un
til the forklced ends stand out all over
it. Then a lighted taper is passed up
and down the twist until the outstand
ing ends are burned away.
The entire hair is thus treated.
Generally the scalp is sopftly Irri
tated with the fingers after the singe
Ing, and swveet waters applied. followed
by a thorough brushing until it lies In
smooth, straight strands, without a
single snake's tongue. Then it is
fanned vigorously until perfectly dry.

SAtIWu I4aI HAPPY.
wqm Vudsroske
One of the most important requisites
for. happy home is asef-eontrol, es
peeoilly a g6od command over temper
and tongue. There are many occasions
when the peace of a family might be
preserved by a timely recollection of
the proverb that "silence is golden."
Many of the efforts necessary for the
preservation of peace and happiness in
the home circle are of a negative kind.
and consist in refraining from the
things that jar on others, such as rude
ness, impatience, fault-finding and
other "lesser foxes that spoil the
vine."' Yet this negative work is as
important as the most energetico exer
tions of bustling activity, perhapseven
more so.
It is of great importance that cour
tesy be strictly observed in the family
circle. It is the lubricating oil that
makes the jarring machinery of life go
on smoothly. Insist on your children
observing the rules of politeness
towards each other as strictly as to
waids strangers. Above all, let hus
band and wife do this towards -eah
other, and the children will easily
and naturally imbibe the same spirit
and form the same habit. Innocent
amusements are one of the elements
of a happy home, and none is more re
fining than music. We should culti
vate as a fine art the habit of talking
cheerfully and good humoredly in the
family circle-excluding harassing and
depressing topics, except when it is ab
solutely necessary to introduce them.
A little social enjoyment is necessary
in order to complete the circle of home
happiness. It is not right always to
seclude ourselves in the privacy of
home. Ye should sometimes open the
doors, and admit others to share its
pleasures and comforts. In doing this
we will receive as much as we give, for
it will enlarge the circle of our ideas,
our affections and our sympathies.
Flower culture is a great addition to
the happiness and general attraotive
ness of a home. Indeed, no place
seems thoroughly homelike without
their lovely and fragrant forms. Be
ing a pursuit that is carried on in the
fresh air and sunshine, flower culture
adds to our health, besides gratifying
our taste and inclinations.
But when all is summed up, it seems
to me that the great value of home life
lies in something better than even hap
piness itself. It gives us the finest and
best discipline life could possibly af
ford. It teaches, if we will receive its
training aright-lessons of unselfish
love, patience, forbearance, forgive
ness, self abnegation, and other lovely
virtues and graces, such as no other
school on earth could possibly afford.
In a high state of development, home
life reminds me of a well-trained
orchestra in which the members, by
dint of practicing with each other, and
tuning their instruments (i. e., their
dispositions) to accord with each other,
learn to give forth a lovely and har
monious symphony that is pleasing to
all persons.-Mary Washington Early.

POU¶Ti ABOUT POTATOES.

To the majority of people there are
only two classes of potatoes, the good
and the poor. Farmers recognize four
principal clases, but with the experts
who make astudy of their development
the classes go far beyond such a simple
division, while the number of varieties
is something overwhelming to a novice
in potato lore. At the Columbian fair
the New York potato exhibit alone
contained two hundred ana fifty varie
ties.
Experiments which are now being
carried on to increase the quantity of
starch in the potato have met with
great success. In Europe the Germans
stand at the head in potato culture, but
BURBANK CLASS.
the French are pushing forward rapid
ly, so that the potato display at the
recent Paris agricultural show was con
sidered the most notable exhibit.
In America attention has been direct
ed rather to the production of new va
rieties than to improvement by selec.
tion within a variety. These new va
rieties are produced every year, and
when one is grown that has some qual
ity which makes it superior to preced
ing sorts, it is sure to find a foothold
with potato growers and so takes its
place as a market variety in the class
to which it belongs.
Most of these varieties are the prod
act of careful crossing of the best sorts
and the gradual development of the re
sulting seedlings. When one is pro
duced that possesses such character
istics as to separate it from all its pred
ecessors, it becomes the founder of a
new class. Each variety derived from
it, and resembling it more or less, is
given a name to distinguish it from
other varieties, but all belong to the
same class, so that while growers rec
ognize both variety and class, dealers
acknowledge class only.
The four principal classes are the
Burbank, Hebron, Rose and Peerless.
the three first being for fall and win

rieties to plant, it is well to consider
the demands of the market which is
expected to furnish buyers, and the
kind of soil and treatment required.
Each variety has its likes and dislikes.
and it will pay the grower to gratify
them.
In order to distinguish the different
types of potatoes, it may be said that
the Burbank class includes all white
kidney-shaped potatoes, the leading
varieties at this time being "Morning
Star," "White Star." Dandy," "White
Flower," "Dutton's Seedling," etc.
The Hebron class includes all flesh
colored or pink and white mottled pota
toes, the principal varieties being
"White Elephant." "June Eating,"
"Gen. Garfield," "Albino," etc.
The Rose class includes all red pota
toes, but is subdivided into three inu

portant sections. The first, or Ohio
division, is made up of all red or rose
colored potatoes, that are short and
cylindrical in form, as "Early Electric,"
"Early Market." "New Zealand,"
"Everett's Six Weeks," etc.
The second division of the Rose class
resembles in shape the Burbank, but
the color is red instead of white. The
present prominent varieties are "Sum
mit." "Pearl of Savoy," "New York
Central" and "Paris Rose."
The third section of the Rose class
includes all the other shapes and sizes
of red potatoes, such as "Dakota Seed
ling." "Dakota Red," "Ideal," "Mag
gie Murphy," etc.
The shape of all potatoes of the
fourth or Peerless class is round or
oval. As this description is somewhat

misleading they be better defined as
large, fiat potatoes, being much broad
er and longer than they are thick. Po
tatoes of the Peerless class are not
Sgenerally marketed until spring on ac
count of their superior keeping quali
ties. The prominent varieties are
"Rural Blush," red; "Rural New
Yorker," No. 2, white. "and Blue Vic

The best all-round white potato is
the "Rural New Yorker," No. 2. It is
prolific, vigorous and of excellent qual
ity, while most of the tubers are of a
medium and merchantable size.
W)hy Stock Farming Pays.
It pays to keep stock even.when it
is low in price. WVe all know that
stock growing keeps our farms in bet
ter heart than grain growing; that by
steadily growing grain and selling it
our farms gradually run down, while
with stock growing we can keep them
np to a high state of fertility. It is
for just the reason here shown. The
farmer who sells a ton of wheat worth,
say, $20 or 825 sells $7.T5 worth of ni
trogen, phosthhoric acid and potash,
while the farmer who sells a ton of
sheep worth $80 or $100sells only $9.44
worth of fertility,-IFarmert' Voioe,

where all vaeises are bred in their
purity? The mann enragesd in this oe
cupation is generally happy, lookldng
after his fowls, seeing that each breed
is kept to itself, and that the little
ones are not run over by the larger
ones. He passes his Sock of Light
Brahmas with admiration. He loves
their peaceable dispositlon and large
size. He keeps the White Created
Black Polish for their beauty, the
Games for their majestic appearance,
and the Hamburgs and Leghorns for
their activity and egg production.
How amusing it is to watch a happy
family of young chickens "gathering
home in the evening around the fam
v4y hearth," and seeming to talk over
the day's labor,how some may say they
caught a bug, a cricket, a grasshopper,
or saw a snake, or smelled a skunk.
The man who has all pure bred
fowls generally calls his wife by lov
ing names, and his children are happy,
too. But is it anyi wonder there are so
msanyross men and women when they
see so many dung-hill fowls around their
places? The man who-keeps this class
of fowls does not call his wife by ten
der names, and he receives no profit
from them. If they lay at all they lay
straw-stack. If he only raises a few
chickens he condemns the business
and says it doesn't pay. If a chicken
happens to get into the garden, where
a pick may be off, he runs and yells
and throws stones and clubs at the
poor fowl; and if he happens to kill
her in his passion he turns cannibal
and eats her. His wife takes the eggs
to town and sells them, and with the
money buys him a nice hat or gloves,
or something he may be in need of-he
clubs the hens for hunting their living
in his garden.
A man who does not like fowls, and
take care of them, is not safe for a
young lady to wed. In conclusion, I
wish to cheer up our poultry raisers,
and do not always look on the dark
side of life's pathway. Give your boy
a chance to care for fowls; teach him
to love and care for them-and when
he grows up he will call you blessed.

unhealthy, that wheat bread spoils the

is the best and most healthy diet. The
shepherds walk on stilts, eat on stilts,
and, if they do not sleep on stilts, they
rest on stilts for hours together- by
means of a stilt rest. This is a long,
stilt-like stick, having a creseentric
curve at the top to fit the back. Thus
with the stilts stretched out to right
and left, and this stic' in the rear,
they are well braced. The stilt-walk
ers manage to go through the deep

or seven miles an hour. The dress of
the shepherd is rough and quaint. He
wears a sheepskin with the wool on,
in the form of a loose, hooded coat.

Feeding Fowln In Summer.
During the summer months the feed
of poultry should be changed from that
which was fed during the winter. Less
heating foods are needed as the spring
opens and the weather grows Warmer,
and the fat-producing foods should
gradually be lessened in quantity.
Fresh grass and vegetables may be fed
generously, instead of so much grain,
and chickens should be given the range
of the .barnyard and field to pick up
seeds and insects. In the hot summer
time but little corn and grain should
be fed, for these are so heating they
are apt to cause disease and death. The
best food that can be given to poultry
at this season is all the fruits, vegeta
bles and green things, including seeds
and insects, they can eat.
THE advice to make the hen work for
her food cannot be too often given.
Scatter it among straw where she
must scratch for it, or make her work
in any other way that may suggest it
