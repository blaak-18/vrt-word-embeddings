What Our Farmers A re Saying and Doing
Dear Sir: —I write to ask you if
you will please publish through your
next week’s Jeffersonian the amount
of bagging and ties that may legally
be placed on a bale of cotton. I have
always thought that thirty pounds
was allowed, or that thirty pounds
was taken from the price paid the
producer. Please explain this. The
cotton factors in Augusta are now
taking fifty cents from every bale
that has over seven yards of bagging
and six ties, in addition to the thirty
pounds allowed for wrapping.
Very truly yours,
R. S. ROWE.
(Answer.)
Your favor received. Your under
standing about the custom that has
prevailed ever since I knew anything
about the selling of cotton is correct.
The Liverpool prices are based upon
an allowance of c. i. f. and 6 per cent.
—meaning first cost, insurance,
ocean freight and 6 per cent, for
tare. On a 500-pound bale, which is
about the average, this, of course,
would be about thirty pounds. In
other w’ords, cotton is so bought that
no matter what the farmer thinks on
the subject, he loses thirty pounds,
the estimated weight of the bagging
and ties. Another name for this is
tare, the wrappage of the cotton tak
ing the place of the boxes which en
close the goods, the bottles which en
closes the liquid, or the sack which
encloses the flour.
A MOUSE FARM.
When we wrote of those terrapin
farms, we thought up here in con
servative Indianapolis that we had
reached the limit. But now we are
gracely told by the American Culti
vator of a mouse farm. And it is
kept by a woman, too. And no au
tomatic device for holding up her
skirts, or to enable her to jump
upon benches and to scream is men
tioned, either. She lives in Western
Massachusetts, and she makes a liv
ing raising these rodents.
Last year, we are told, she sold
8,000 mice and rats for experiment
al purposes. They were bought by
the laboratories for use in the study
of tuberculosis and various other
diseases. The animals, after being
bought, are artificially infected, and
the results studied with carefully re
corded observations. The mice sell
at from sls to $25 per hundred.
Rats bring about $25 per hundred.
On the farm they are kept in cages
and in the various farm buildings.
Besides rats and mice, several hun
dred guinea pigs and rabbits are
kept. Some of the animals are of
rare breeds, and are sold for pets.
The animals are all fed on grain
and vegetables, and several hundred
dollars’ worth of oats and several
tons of carrots and other vegetables
are consumed by them annually.
Guinea pigs are used in large num
bers in the laboratories in the man
ufacture of antitoxin, antidotes for
the poison which certain diseases
create in the system.
WHAT SOUTHERN SOILS CAN DO.
A farmer writes to the Progres
sive Farmer that he expects two and
one-half bales of cotton per acre.

The old plantation ilea may prevail
Now nine cotton farmers out of ten
in the South, after getting thoir land
to do that, would want to plant that
land in cotton again, and .would say
that they could not afford to grow
corn on it. But this man wisely says
that that land goes into corn the
coming year, and he hopes to make
100 bushels per acre with his care
fully selected seed, for he has im
proved his cotton and corn both by
selection. And yet, hundreds of
farmers write asking for fertilizer
formulas for making land that only
makes ten bushels of corn produce
50 bushels, when they could do just
as well as this man has done with
his corn and cotton, by improving
the land gradually and selecting
their seed in an intelligent way.
HOGS AND PEANUTS.
The bacon type is a hog with small
bone, straight lines on both back
and belly, short snout, short legs,
wide across shoulders and hams,
long sides and when looked at from
side or rear presents a square ap
pearance. The hog that will mature
at an early iage, bring most on the
market and can be produced at the
lowest possible cost is the one to
raise. To produce meat it is neces
sary to grow crops other than corn
to get best and cheapest results. Le
gumes form the best pastures. Hogs
will grow fat on clover alone, but by
adding a light feed of corn the best
results are obtained. Peanuts and
sw’eet potatoes form ideal foods for
fattening and the hogs harvest them.
Peanuts also produce from one to
two tons of hay per acre, worth from
15 to S2O per ton, and the nuts are
left in the ground for the hogs.
Where alfalfa can be grown it has
no equal, but it will not grow on
some soils that will produce good
crops of peanuts, potatoes or cow
peas.—Texas Farmer.
SUPPORTING TWO FAMILIES.
Wallace’s Farmer, in a recent is
sue, says: “We are coming to a
time and we are sorry for it when a
quarter section of land in the Mis
sissippi Valley must support two
families, the landlord and the ten
ants.”
This is the old world problem of
tenant farming. It is the land prob
lem of the ages.
In so far as it relates to the own
ership of the land and the tenant
working for a landlord, it is, as Wal
lace’s Farmer says, a matter to be
regretted.
It is well to see, says Home and
Farm, whether that relation cannot
be to some extent avoided. We are
coming to the time undoubtedly
when one acre will have to do the
work that two acres did in our fore
fathers’ time. The demand from
the world for food and clothing in
creases constantly, and with the
multiplication of machinery and the
increase of capital in centers of pop
ulation, the power of purchase will
be greatly increased and the demand
will be for more farm products at
better prices.
This means a division of the land,
the use of smaller pieces of ground.
for years to come in certain sections
of the country, but what is generally
termed “intensive farming” and
sometimes “diversified farming”
means the more thorough tillage of
every acre. That necessitates either
the sale of large plantations on rea
sonable terms to men of small
means, or else, as our Northern con
temporary says, it means landlord
and tenant.
There should be some plan for
small farmers purchasing such farms
as they need at fair prices on long
time. Something of this kind we
have in the cities where men work
ing for daily wages seek to buy and
pay for a home out of their savings.
Capital comes in to assist them, and
we have savings banks, building and
loan associations and various other
plans for putting at the disposal of
the industrious, sober, persistent
day laborer certain financial re
sources that enable him to buy and
pay for his house in a reasonable
time.
We ought to have something cor
responding to this movement in ag
riculture.
FARM BUTTER.
Some fine butter is made on the
farm, but so much is inferior that
this class of butter is badly discount
ed in the general market. The good
and the bad are collected together
at the country store, and in selling
to the wholesaler or the commission
house the country dealer lumps it all
off, good and bad together, at a re
duced rate.
Thus the maker of good farm but
ter suffers by being found in bad
company. Where the good and bad
are mixed, the good always suffers.
Prices tend to range with the lowest
quality at the expense of the highest.
It does not seem possible to have
all farmers make first-class butter.
They could if they would, but they
just won’t do it, and the only way
out for the producers of good butter
is to make special engagements, and
thus go directly to the consumer, or
else ship to special dealers in fine
butters.
Good farm butter generally does
find its higher level of price in the
city market, but it is after being as
sorted out by the city merchant. He
goes over his country store lots and
grades them. The best he puts off
as creamery butter at the higher
price, which goes to the generally
recognized good qualities of that
class.
The farmer that wants to get a
good price for his butter or any oth
er products must produce a first
class article and then come out from
among the mass of bad producers
when he seeks a market. It is the
only way to protect yourself and get
a high price for your wares.—Home
and Farm.
