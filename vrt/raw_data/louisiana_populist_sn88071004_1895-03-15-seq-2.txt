CONGRESSMAN OGDEN
On His way Home from Wash
ington.
Congressman Harry 'W. Ogden
of the Fourth congressional dis
trict of Louisiana, is stopping at
the Pickwick. lie leaves to-day
for Shreveport. Talking with a
reporter, Mr. Ogden said that the
people in his district were glad the
bounty had been granted by con
gress. There was no opposition
to it he said, and the press up there
was unanimously in favor of its
payment. He hoped, be said, it
would prove a great benefit to the
planters and people of the city and
surrounding country. He was
sure it would be of great value to
the entire state.
Congressman Ogden said he be
lieved that the silver question
would be paramount in the next
national election.
"For the past ten years or
more," he said, "the tariff has been
the leading issue, but that is worn
out now and the entire country has
tired of tariff agitation. I don't
think there will be any more gener
al tariff bills, but there will be
changes wrought in special meas
ures. There Is no doubt that a
general tariff revision or agitation
upsets and unsettles business. Bus
iness necessarily suffers from it
and the financial and commercial
interests of the country, as well as
others, have about concluded that
it should stop. The political par
ties will, therefore, turn to the
silver--or the financial issue.
"The movement of the bimetal
lic league I don't think will have
the effect of creating a new party.
It goes to the country on a single
idea and consequently can't count
for much. The movement is non
partisan and is led by men from
the ranks of the two old parties.
I believe in bimetallism-in giving
silver an equal chance with gold.
I don't believe the matter will go
long now without settlement.
My district is for silver, but I
don't believe the people up there
will leave the Democratic party.
The Democratic party being the
party of the people, they must look
to it for the success of measures
subservient to their general inter
ests. 1io; they won't go off after
the strange gods which new crea
tions set up for worship."
Notice that he does not say the
tariff has been settled or properly
adjusted, but that it is worn out
because the people are tired of its
agitation. He admits then that it
was merely a hobby for politicians
to ride into office on and not the
"robber tariff" which it was pro
nnunced by all his party in 1892.
He says the bimetallic and silver
party will not amount to ioch.
"The movement is nonpartisan and
is led by men from the rank of the
two old parties." Yet some folks
want the populists to break up
their party and run off after this
'"nonpartisan" scheme of the two
old parties. We want to say right
here that the populists are not go
ing todo anything of the sort.
Mr. Ogden says, "I believe in
bimetallism." * * "I' don't
believe the matter will go long
now without settlement."
Guees he thihks it will just settle
itself. We fail to see any other
wayforit to be settled on his
theory. The democratic party
won't do it, They were elected
for thatpurpose and didn't do it,
and he says his people (us fool
folks here m the th district) are
not going to quit the democratic
party, though they want silver
mighty bad. He says, '"The dem
oratie partybeing the party of
the people, they must look to it for
the soesmofmesmuresetc. Wheth
er thay ever get the sucems or not,
they mrst look no other way. To
lookelsewhere would be treason,
inseulity, false idolstry.
He ays, "No, they won't go of
aftertbhe strange goes set up by
new oratilon."
Certainly not. They will just
worship theold gdb right traight
alonga dhttheir wives sad chil
drm work in theb seld beside them
amdnsv hear ten of a school
book or church house before they
will reoma after .aw l-.
If th re anything in the world
thy do love, its their old -ds
cbaSmong tm thousand c which
is ta demo~ai party and alto

thingthe palts of this 4th district
does haa, it'su megJ ami ws
thinkthk m-a whp iimad that
own dear useful congressnman to
clear us of the charge, ought to be
hanged.
No, our congressmuan is right.
we are going to swing on to our
old gods and 4 cent cotton. We'd
like to have free silver, and it's go
ing to settle itself before long, but
then we will do without that or
anything else rather than forsake
our old gods, for didn't they bring
us right down to the present time?
And how do we know that we
could navigate without them ?
From the way our congressman
talks about free silver settling it
self, we are satisfied he knows all
about "over production," "hog
and hominy," and the "interna
tional bimetallic confc rence,' 'where
our good old friend of Revolutiona
fame John Bull, is going to give
us free silver: and we hope our
said congressman will interview a
Picayune reporter on these ques
tions so we can learn something
about them without going off after
st range gods.
By the way, this is the man
whose henchmen have stolen a seat
for him in the next Congress. Some
of the men who voted for him are
now free to admit that Mr. Bailey
(Populist) was elected by 2000 ma
jority.
A gentleman who lives and votes
in Alexandria, said the other day
that he counted every vote cast at
that box, staying at the poll all day
for that purpose, and the total was
281. The commissioners returned
874-all but 2 for Ogden.
A prominent gentlemen at Le
compte said the commissioners vo
ted his father, who had been dead
ten years, for he saw his name on 1
the poll lists, and made one of the
commissioners acknowledge to hav
ing put it there. j
People are fast awakening to the
degrading and damnable effects of t
such thievery and perjury, and it t
will be put down. Then a man i
who is so far lost to self respect t
and decency as to receive stolen
goods will take a back seat along e
with the thieves and perjurers who ,
are his partners in crime.
Douglass Episode 1
About Which a North Carolina i
Paper Started that Lie
Upon Which Democractic Pa- a
pers Re-Lied In Unison.
The Truth About
the Matter.
The following resolutions recit
ing the facts in regard to the Fred
Douglass episode was adopted by t
the North Carolina House of Rep t
resentatives by a vote of 53 for ]
and 27 against.
THE RESOLUTION. I
"Whereas, the Dlemocratic press
have wiltully and maliciously c
charged and published that the 1
General Assembly of 1805 refused I
to adjourn out ot reslpect to the
memory ot the birth-days of Wash- a
ingtota aml Lee, but did adjourn r
out of respect to the memnory of e
Fred Douglass, and
"Whereas, by such false state
ments they lhave retflected upon the
dignity and purpose of the present 1
House, and I
"W'hereas, the facts in the case
are as follows:
"That on the 18th day of Janu- C
ary, 1896, Mr. French offered the a
following resolution:
"Resolved, by the House of Rep- a
resentatives, the Senate concur
ring, That when this House ad
jonrny it adjourn to meet Monday
at 3 P. M."
Mr. Frencb moved to suspend
the rules, which wrs done, and the a
resolution was adopted without as
dissenting vote, andul sent to the r
Senate for concurrence, which reso a
Intion the journal bshows was adopt
ed. This resolution being non-.
concurred-in by the Benate, the
House met next morning at the I
usual hour, and after being t sea I
saion less thlan halt an hour, on mo- a
tion of Mr. Young, of Wake, the f
House adjourned out of respect to t
the meory of uobert E. Lee, the t
same being his birthday.
On the 21st of Feruarry areso- a
lution to adjourn from Thuraday t
until BSaturday, out of' respect to 1
the memory of George Washing- t
ton was offered by Mr. Willisma,
ot Oraven, and was puaed by as
very large majority; the usame was c
-onoeeurred-in by the Senate.a i

THE DOUGI.ASS MATTER.
Whereas, ont the 2l1t day of
February a riesolution w-a; offered
by ('s.x s. o.t" (Granville, that the
House diljourn at 12 o'locwk, out iof
reslpect to iFred 1 )uglass, when
his s.ºlen dtlathl hI:aul just been an
nounced. The House did not ad
journ at thlis hour, but when the
purpose of the motion was explain
ed to simply give publicity to the
sudden and unexpected death of
this distinguished deceased, it was
concurred in by all parties, and as
a matter of fact, the House did not
adjourn until 37 minutes after the
tune required by the rules for ad
journment; now therefore, be it
Resolved, That in the interest of
truth and accuracy of history the
utterances and expressions of the
Democratic press in this connection
are denounced as unjust, untrue,
misleading, malicious and libel
lous.
Resolved further, That this re
cord, as above recited, and resolu
tions b- spread upon the minutes
of the House.
A North Carolina Democratic
paper lied, and some of our Dem
ocratic papers RE-LIED. They
have not as yet shown enough self
respect to correct this impudent
and malicious slander.
We give below the report of the
Norfolk Pilot :
"On the day after the death of
Frederick Douglass a colored rep
resentative named Crews offered a
resolution providing that the House
adjourn at 12 o'clock AM.. as a mark
of respect to Douglass. Mr. Crump
ter a Populist, at once offered an
amendment to make the hour of
adjournment 2 o'clock, which was
the regular hour of adjournment.
Speaker Walser ruled the amend
ment and resolution both out of
order, saying that the house would
not adjourn until the business of
the day was disposed of. He then
suggested that a motion might be
made that when the house did ad
journ it could be as a mark of res
pect. A standing vote on a mo
tion to this effect was taken and
carried. No special attention was
given to the matter, and in the
rush of business, it seems that there
was an impression that the speak
er's ruling would do away with any
signiflsance ot the resolution. The
strongest illustration of this state
ment is the fact that a number of
Democrats voted for the resolution,
and have, since it passed, said they
voted for it.
Telegrams sent out by the Unit
ed Press stated that the General l
Assembly had refused to adjourn
in honor of Washington anti Lee,
but did adjourn in honor of Doug
lass. The facts are these:
The Legislature did adjourn in
honor of Washington and Lee
both houses taking special note of
their respective birthdays. The
House only took any notice of the
death of Douglass, and that was
under the conditions above named.
It is a fact that on the minutes
of the House there appears a reso
lution which shows when the
House did adjourn it be in honor
of Fred Douglass, but the House
remained in session for thirty-sev
en minutes over the regular time
for adjournment that day, and the
Douglass matter was of such com
plete insignificance as to be com
pletely lost sight of.
It is the opinion of leading men
of the General Assembly that the
construction being put upon the
matter by some papers is unworthy
of decent and truthful journalism.
-Virginia Bun.
By this time next year the free
silver question may be a mere "side
issue." The real issue may be
again whether the South shballbe
ruled by her own people or by
such men as the Douglassites who
now have control in North Caro
The above is taken from the
leading BRichmond Democratic dai
ly, the organ of the wily Charles
and special champion of election
frand& In the coming Presiden
tirl election the same old trick is
to be tried: "This way white
menl Nigger! huigger!" Free
silver is to be a "side isne," and
the people are to be scared into
voting against their Interests by
the old threadbare cry of negro
domination. But the people will
not again be fooled by such a cry,
coming from the party whome Pres
ident, Grover Cleveland, and his
wife, honored Fred Douglass by
inviting him to rceptions at the
White Hoe, and who refthed to
attend Governor Fits Lee's recep
ioa whean they beard Miss Winnle
Dails, " the daughter of the Con
federacy," would assist Mrs. Lee to
receive. Free silver will not be a
"side issue," and the fraud-loving
Democracy is hugging a delusioU
when it suPlposes the peopile can
be made to believe it is a "side
issue."-Virginia Sun.
People's Party Meeting in Cald
well Pansh
The Executive Conmmittee of the
People's party of Caldwell parish
met in Columbia, March 4th 1595,
present, Emile Girod ward 2; J.
B. Meridith ward 4; T. R. Mert
dith ward 5; Wnm. Thames ward r6;
Win. Rogers ward 9 and (Geo.
Humphries ward 10.
The committee on resolutions,
Emile Girod, Winm. Thames and
Geo. Hlumphries, brought in the
following which was adopted:
Be it resolved by the People's
party executive committee of
Caldwell parish, in called session
convened, That we do not alto
gether approve of the action of the
People's party executive commit
teo of Winn parish, in regard to
judicial nominations.
Resolved further, That we, the
People's party executive commit
tee of Caldwell parish, La., desir
ing to represent the wishes and
best interests of our people, de
cline to endorse the action of the
People's Party executn e committee
of Winn parish.
Resolved further, That we re
quest that the judicial committees
of each parish in the 4th judicial
district meet at Winnfield on the
id Monday in April. 1895, for the
purpose of organizing a judicial
district committee.
Resolved further, That the ju
dicial committee, so organized,
shall decide upon what action they
may deem to the best interests of
our people, and then submit same
to the people for their considera
tion, through mass meetings or
otherwise, to be held in each parish
composing the 4th judicial district.
Resolved further, That the press
of said district be requested to
publish these proceedings.
The above is a mild notice that
some lawyer or lawyers in the- 4th
judicial district want to figure as
People's party nominees for judge
and district attorney. These res
olutions were evidently drawn up
by a lawyer as his "fine italian
hand" is plainiy visible between
the lines. "Do not altogether ap
prove of the action of the People's
party-executive committee of Winn
parish." He(the lawyer) means
that he does not at all approve of
their action, but that he must put
it mildly soas not to ruffle their
feelings and expose his real pur
pose.
Now we know that some of the
members of that committee does
approve of the action of Winn
parish. Some too who have free
ly given their time, money, good
name and all they had to build up
and establish the People's party
and that too when the men who
planned the above resolutions and
led the fight for their adoption
were burning tickets and stuffing
ballot boxes against the People's
party.
The following shows what the
Populists of Jackson parish think
of Winn parish's action in this
matter:
A number of our populist friends
with whom we have conversed, to
a man endorse the action of the
populists of Winn in declaring
against a convention for judicial
officers, holding to the belief that
these oices should be held aloof
from partisan politics.
We have talked with a number of
populists from three parishes in
the district, and have. to find the
first one who opposes it. Many
populists in this parish have come
up voluntarily and commended
the idea, saying that it is high
groundfor the party to take and
will beto our advantage not only
in gaining us votes but will save
the party from the schemes and
double-dealing with which lawyers
have ruined both the old parties.
They say, and truthfully too,
that if this plan does not prevail
lawyers will flock into the party
wherever it is strong enough to
secure the offices and they will
run all the conventions, primaries
and mass meetings, fll all the ofi
ces and farmers and laborers will
take a back seat just as they have
always done in the presence of la~
yers in the old parties and tht
our party will be gone.
We believe this is correct, if any
oIne iprof'ession has dominated both
the old parties, to their ruin and
lrought this country to starvation
in the midst of plenty, it is the
unscruplulous legal talent of the
country. andl if the Peop,le's party
desires to steer clear of a similar
fate it hadl l etter shut it4 doors
now on lawyers. It can do this
and can do it onl ,vby making those
offices which must be tilled by
lawyers nonpartisan, and till all
other offices from governor down
to constable with farmers, artisans
and1 trades-people.
We repeat that we believe WVinn
parish has taken the foremost step
in this matter as she has always
done in the People's party, and
that her position cannot he success
fully assailed or gain-said by any
one, and we believe the great mass
of the populists in Caldwell and
all over the district will endorse
her action.
Caldwell populists will remem
that it was the pioneer reformers
from Winn parish that came to
their assistance when the men who
are now trying to lead them were
burning their populist tickets and
counting out Meridith, (J. B.)
Humphries and Simmons.
Those would-be-populist nomi
nees for judge and district attor
ney might continue their assistance
to Mr. Boatner in his steal of Pop
ulist votes from Benoit, but it does
appear a little inconsistent for
them to beat the same time at
tempting to run the People's party
in the interest of their respective
candidacies.
BATON ROUtE, LA.,
March 11, 1895. f
EDITOR LA. POPULIST.
I)EAR SIR:-The subject of "Le
gal Tender" which you refered to'
in a private letter Is one full of in
terest. It is a serious question
whether or not it would be advisa
ble to discard( intrinsic value money
entirely, using as a medium of ex
change no money but the legal ten
der of Tiffany. For many years
the best thinkers have abandoned
the intrinsic value theory of money,
and thoroughly understanding the
uses and purposes of money as we
do to-day, there are: but two argu
ments that can beadvanced in fav
or of intrinsic value as against le
gal tender fiat money.
The one is that, intrinsic value'
money is used as bullion in inter
national transactions and has what
is commonly believed to be the
further advantage of retaining its
bulion value after the goyernment
issuing it has ceased to exist.
Clearly, the former is an advan
tage. But in a late communication
on "legal tender" to the Comrade
I have indicated a way in which
international transactions may be
made as easily under a legal tender -
system as they now are under the'
pretended intrinsic value sy-ste1
in vogue. As to the latter I a .
not so sure that this supposed a.c
vantage is an advantage at all.
And without going into an elabo
rate argument to establish the
point I may illustrate with a ques
tion and case in point. Is it not
practicable under present methods -
of financiering for one or a few in-i
dividuals to got possession of all
the intrinsic value money and thert
to be able to say, "The government
be damned, we have got all th.
money?" And they could dakr,
and destroy the govbrnment ant
their money still have its value, joy
they might take their money bag'
and sail off to Europe with ther
and leave us without a medium of
exchange. This could not be saic
of legal tender money, we have not
a case, but cases in point, Om
goldis being constantly sent awa3
to Europe, not to settle balances
but to be boarded there; not to des
troy this government outright, bo
to distres us and force us to bor
row, and issue bonds, and pa)
more interest to get it back agai.
ass basis of a medium of exchange
notwithstanding congress has am
pie powerr to provide a mediun
of exchange at no cost whatever
as demonstrated by Judge Tiffany
our accepted authority.
Under the legal tender system
pure and simple, there can bh m
doubt but that the patriotic senti
ment would be reinforced by tha
other powerful factor in the malk
up of the human animal, self inter
et. It would become the sole in
terest of everyproperty owner, o
every owner of a dollar to stand b;
the government issuing his dollq
and protecting his property valuq
There would be no mnentive to ai
Astor to hiehimself away with hI
money bags to a foreign land ther
to buy unto himself a newspape
with which to turn upon and~
mean his native land.
Really the.question is a seriou
one to all interested in sound finane
and republiSan ideas of goverr
ment, and I trust the agitatio
may continue until we reach
bettlementof it, calculated to s
cure to theentire human race tb
greatest measure of good.
Yours truly,
J. T. HOWUL,
