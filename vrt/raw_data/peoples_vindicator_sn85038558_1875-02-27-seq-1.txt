Thie Pepulicnn journals do not, do
sire the contiinauce in office of,a
President whlosi conduct and policet
they are ashamed to advocate and
cannot defend. .
The strange Arkansas message, nn
necontable even from Grant, mallst i
inteilsify the Republican regret that I
Mr. 'Wilson is not at the head of the
governnient. His Excelleacy seems I
to have lost his maletory, besides. abdi
cating all the claims lie ever had to
comnamon sensed it is incouceivable
that hay man who had not hopelesAl*
lost his wits, it is astonishing that
aty. lltU outside the walls of an any=
imi for lunatics, could have enut to
Congress a lie',saga which so con
denlns and repudiate his own recent
policy respecting ltffairs in Arkansas.
In J872 Brooks ran on the Greeley
ticket aid IBaxter on the Grant ticket:
The Gi'as party iii'that State coniit
ed Brooks out land' Baxier in, with
the President's' implied saenction.
[Brooks has since changed frontland

for no other eason known to the piib- t
lic,, his tkeellency has also clmtinge

' Why did he not make this ediscove

the returns of that eleetitn were

is. scatdalous for the President t A
change his opiniop on euchi t point i

that the Greeley. candidate, who wis

coat alnd become a supporter of G ranut.
Did this whifling oiltce-seeker's de- a
setion. of hhi aopporters change the e
nunmber of votes east for him.in 1872f 1
There is still stronger reason, if a' J
stronger he possible, why the Presi- I
dent should not -hvd'mnatc this late I
recognition of Brooks. No longer p
ago than last May, General Grant is- I
sued a proclamation, in which he aij- c
serted the title of laxter and denied. r
that of Brooks to the Governorslip. i

stultification to be found .in the,oal- i
cial records of any goverulieu't. It I
can not be doabted that thie country,
irnrespective of party diffbrenlces, I
would feel a sense of relief on the
resignation of such a President, lnor
that the Riepublicans wonuld hail with
