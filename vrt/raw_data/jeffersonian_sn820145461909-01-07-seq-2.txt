WILL THE TARIFF BE RE
VISED?
When two such stalwart Republi
cans as Andrew Carnegie and James
J. Hill declare, the one for tariff for
revenue only and the other for free
trade with Canada, there is cause for
sensational alarm in the camp of the
standpatters and the tariff beneficiar
ies. The committee of Congress who
are holding daily sittings for investi
gation of the tariff, for the purpose
of reporting to Congress at the spe
cial session to be held after March
4 next, have been entertained by the
one-sided view of the tariff benefi
ciaries, and because the mass of con
sumers never have a chance at such
hearings to present their side, it be
gan to look as though there was but
one side and the dreams of tariff re
formers were taking on the usual
gloomy cast. The Republican party
was beginning to rub its hands and
assure the country that the tariff was
well enough as it is and that there
was no real demand for keeping its
promises of revision, when the can
ny Andrew let fly his bomb that the
industries of the country were no
longer infants and could get along
with little if any protection, espe
cially the steel trust and the oil
trust. Then came forth Mr. Hill, the
greatest railroad authority in the
country, with the startling view that
we need closer relations with Cana
da, and that reciprocity in the way
of lowering of tariff duties was de
manded. Following closely on these
statements comes the announcement
that President-elect Taft demands
that the revision of the tariff be a
real one in the shape cf a radical re
duction of duties and that war is to
be made on Speaker Cannon and
other congressional standpatters, if
need be, to keep the promises of the
Republican platform. Truly there
are things happening that inspire
hope in the hearts of the dishearten
ed believers in lower duties. The
Democratic party has been defeated
at the election, but the main issue in
which it has fought so many cam
paigns seems to live. Tariff for pro
tection that has bred trusts and in
creased the cost of living beyond the
average man’s means, may yet have
to give way to the Democratic doc
trine of tariff for revenue and trust
made articles on the free list. The
campaign of education that has been
waged by the Democratic party at
the expense of its chances of victory
may yet bear fruit. —The Dover
(Del.) Index.
MEETING A CONDITION.
Is the panic over 1 ?
Are times getting better?
No one has ever accused the Nash
ville Herald of being a pessimist.
We believe in looking at the bright
side. But there is no smothering or
concealing the fact that it is the
better part of wisdom to be cau
tious and, as the saying is, go slow.
It may be right to say the panic is
over and pretend to believe it, for
the sake of effect. The saying, “hitch
your w r agon to a star,” sounds nice,
but we once read of a fellow who
fell in a ditch and broke his neck
while watching the stars.
Business men should buy sparingly
and push business with a vim. Don’t
go in debt if you can help it. The
best way to end the panic is to get
your business in good shape and keep
it so. Don’t plunge. Settle down
to conservative business. Bragging
about big business and flush times is
not the only way to fight panics.
We have heard a number of people
criticising the banks, claiming that
they were contributing to the paiiic
by charging a higher rate of interest
and withholding accommodations that
would be granted in better times.
However, the banks should not be
criticised too severely, as their first
duty is to look out for No. 1.
Let’s quit bragging so much about
the panic being over, and depending
on that to end the panic. Let’s go
about it in a more business-like way.

A DOLLAR’S WORTH.
A would-be trouble maker in New
York is calling attention to the fact
that the silver dollar is now worth
only 40 cents in the markets. But,
what of that? Is the paper in a
paper dollar worth as much as 40
cents? Is the nickel in a 5-cent
piece worth 5 cents? The metal
value of a silver dollar may be only
40 cents, but its face value, its pur
chasing value, its bank value, its
treasury value—which certainly
ought to determine its “intrinsic”
value —is 100 cents. We would certaift
ly ask for nothing more than that. —
Savannah News. We don’t care if
there is only 40 cents worth of silver
in a silver dollar or what the in
trinsic value of the paper is that our
paper money is made of, for we have
made special arrangements with our
creditors to accept them at their face
value. If you are due this paper a
dollar, you are hereby notified that
we will take any old dollar that you
may see fit to palm off on us, and, if
we get caught on the 40-eent variety,
you will not be to blame. Bring on
your dollars. —Coffee County News,
Douglas, Ga.
ROOT AND THE TRUSTS.
If Secretary Root is sent to the
Senate, the Trusts will have no cause
to complain, as he has never fought
them, nor their interests. The only
thing that can save the people is to
abolish the Senate. The establish
ment of two houses was a great mis
take committed by the founder of
the Republic. But in imitating the
mother country, in many things they
unfortunately had to have something
similar to the House of Lords. If we
would take from the President his
appointing power and do away with
the Senate it would do more to crip
ple the power of corporations than
anything else. —The Polk County
Record, Bartow, Fla.

A member of the House of Com
mons, a few weeks ago, said that
there had been ninety-two murders
in the city of London since January,
1904. This would be on an average
of not more than nineteen murders
a year in a population of about five
millions. It is common for our
American cities to boast of the rapidi
ty of their growth and the splendor
of their civilization, but it might be
well for them to compare their mur
der statistics with those of London.
Our cities, with less than half the
population of London, will have to
confess to a larger number of mur
ders. The quick and inevitable death
penalty following murder in England
and the facility of escape of the death
penalty in America is an explanation
of the difference. —The Winona
