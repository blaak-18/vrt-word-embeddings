ADMIRAL ASKS FOR IT
Secretary Lang Says an Investigation
Will Be Made in Justice to
Schley-Dewey Will Be the
Head of the Court.
Washington, July 25.-Secretary of
Navy Long has received a letter from
Admiral Schley asking for a court of
inqu:ry. Nothing beyond this an
nouncement has been made public. The
secretary is now in conference wig h
Judge Advocate General Lemly, Al
miral Crowniushild and Captain Cowle.,
assistant chief of the bureau of naviga
tion, presumable concerning the matter.
Admiral Dewey arrived at the navy de
partment shortly after 10:30 o'clock this
morning, having been summoned from
his country home near this city by Sec
retary Long. The conference which
was in progress between the Secretary.
Admiral Crowninshield, Captain Cowles
and Judge Advocate General Lemly
was immediately dissolved on the ar
rival of Admiral Dewey and the admir
al and Secretary Long held a long con
ference.
In his letter to Secretary Long Ad
miral Schley does not specify any of
the criticisms to which he takes excep
tions, but asks, in view of the state
ments and innuendoes and abusive lan
guage contained in Maclay's history,
ADMIRAL S8HLEY.
which he says he does not consider
worthy of use in any college in the
country, that a court of inquiry of the
"entire matter" be held. He also asks
that the court shall sit in Washington
where his papers are stored.
Secretary Long replied to the letter,
saying that "under the circumstances"
he heartily approved Admiral Schley's
course and that the department will act
favorably upon Admiral Schley's re
quest.
It is stated that Admiral Dewey will
It is stated that Admiral Dewey will
undoubtedly be head of the court of in
quiry. The other members of the court
have not yet been decided upon. There
is no intention of having the court oon
vened at once, but it will meet when
the weather becomes cooler.
Admiral Schley's letter to Secretary
Long is as follows:
"Within the past few days series of
press comments have been sent to me
from various parts of the country en
titled 'History of the Navy' written by
one Edward Stanley Maclay. From
these reviews it appears that this edi
tion is the third volume of said history
extended to include the late war with
Spain, which the two Arts volumes do
not contain and were in use as text
books at the navy academy.
"8. From excerpts quoted in some re*
views, lh which the page and paragraph
are given, thqre is such perversion of
facts, misoonsitsction of intention, such
intemperate a and defamation of
myself as to sub Mr. Maclay to as
tion in civil war. ile I admit the
right of fair criticism every public
officer. I must protest anst the low
flings and abusive language of this vio
lent, partisan opponent, who has infus.
ed into pages of this book so much
malice and unfairness as to make it un
worthy the name of history or of use in
any reputable institution of the
country.
"I have refrained heretofore from all
comment upon the innuendoes of ene
mies muttered or murmured in secret
and therefore with safety to themselves,
I think the time has now come to take
such action as may bring this entire
matter under discussion, under clearer
and calmer review of my brothers in
arms, and to this end I ask such action
at the hands of the department as it
may deem best to accomplish this pur
pose. But I would express a request in
this connection that whatever action
may be taken shall eccur in Washing.
Uas, where most of my papers and data
are stored."
Secretaroy L g replied to Admiral
fSchley adfollbws:
"I am in receipt of yours of the 22nd
Instant, with reference to criticisms up
on you in connection with the Spanish
American war and heartily approve
your action. under the circumstances,
in asking at the hands of this depart.

tire matter under discussion undes

Scientist 5,.rv;a Gives His Reasons for
thi -.xtre usm. iet Wave.
New York. July lj -The Journal
prints an article noon the hot weather
by Garrett P. Servis, the scientifio
writ *r. The article, dated at Ithaco,N.
Y., sav-4:
The buriiing heat now afflicting the
whole of the United States and felt
alp on the her side of the Atlantic
and generally throughout the Northern
Hemisphere, is coniviniing proof of the
fact that th- earth is the satellite of a
%ariable star only on the assumption
that the souree of terribli heat is di
reetl` in the sun and due to an extraor
dinary iucr:a e in its effective radiation
can the long continued nature of the
present meterological disaster be satis
factorily explained.
All astronomers know that the face
of tho sun is blanketed with absorbing
vapors, while its interior is much hot
ter than the glowing shell that we see.
Strip off the vaporous blanket entirely
and the surface of the earth would
probably burst into smoke and flame to
the instantaneous gush of unbearable
heat that would be poured upon it.
Whenever, as occurs periodically,
though not always to the same extent.
the solar vapors are thinned, the heat
from within leaps out through the
weakened shell and strikes the earth
and the other nearby planets as with a
breath of fire from the suddenly opened
door of a blazing furnace.
That is what happened this summer,
and the immediate agency that has
flung open the furnace doors and sent
forth the destroying blast, is the myste
rious power whose visible manifesta
tions is the presence of black sun spots.
But it is a mistake to suppose that
the sun spots themselves exercise
any direct influence upon the weather
or that there must be spots on the sun
whenever there is extraordinary heat
on the earth.
The spots are simply indicators of the
sun's condition resembling in that re
spect the eruptions on the face of a
smallpox patient. They tell the story
of the sun's internal convulsion and in
dicate some of the places on its surface
where the pentup forces are bursting
out.
For the next four years these gigantic
outbursts will increase in fury, and a
correiponding series of terrestrial sea
sons marked by great excesses of tem
perature, sudden contrasts and extraor
dinary cyclonio disturbances will fol
low.
M'LAURIN OUSTED.
SUtae Ezeeutive Committee Rulee Him
Out of the Party.
Columbia, S. C, July 26.-The state
Democratic executive committee has
adopted a resolution ruling Senator Mc
Laurin out of the Democratic party.
The action was totally unexpected.
Senator Tillman supported the resolu
tion which was unexpectedly offered as
a substitute for a resolution over which
there had been much debate, presenting
the oath to be taken by candidates for
congress in the approaching election to
ill the vacancy caused by the death of
Congressman Stokes of the Seventh dis
trict. The resolution is as follows:
" Whereas, the Hon. John L McLaur.
in, junior senator, elected to represent
the state of South Carolina in the na
lional congress has by his affiliations
and votes in that body ignored the na
tional Democratic platform and thereby
misrepresented his state and his Demo
cratic constituency who elected him.
"Therefore, be it resolved, that it is
the sense and conviction of the Demo
Dratic executive committee that Senator
J. L. McLaurin from the standpoint of
honesty and self respect should tender
his unqualified resignation immediate
ly."
The resolution was adopted by a vote
of 25 to 1.

The flames started in the big piles of
kindling wood, belonging to the Rock

which was soon a roaring furnace. The
spread of the Are was so rapid that
workmen barely had time to escape.
The fire pushed its way into the ad.

homes were burned, leaving hundreds

fought heroically by the departments

be known until the preycept and order

Secretary Long says, however, the pro

the wildest latitude will be permitted in
the matter of witnesses and that Ad

resented by counsel.
The secretary had nothing to say
about the composition of the court ex
cept he thought it spoke for itself and
the hope that the members would be
satisfactory to all concerned. He point
ed out that none of the officers chosen
had, so far as he knew, expressed an
opinion concerning what is known as
the Sampson-Schley controversy and
therefore it will be presumed they
would enter upon their work in an :_...
