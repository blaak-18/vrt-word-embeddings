Hepatitis, or Liver Compalat,
DYSPRPSIA AND sCK HIIADACHK.
Symptoms of a ieased Liver. y
dAIN in the right side, under the
edge of the ribs, ipcrea'pes. o 1
sere; sometimes the paln is in thl
side; the patient is rarely able to lie '
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shodlder blade, and j
it frequently extends to the top of the 1
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom- '
ach is affected with loss of appetite I
and sickness; the bowels in general )
are costive, sometimes alternative with 1
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen- 1
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight, 1
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains 'of weariness
and ebility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burhing, and he corn-'
plains' of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it. 1
In- fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend a
the disease, but cases have occurred 1
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body; after death, has 1
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.

DR. C.' McLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN 1
CASES or AGUE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after-taking Quinine. .We would
advise all who are afilcted with this
disease to give thea a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.

The Long Gone Years.
BY W. C. J.
The long gone years, the long gone yearse
How swift they've fled, how brief they
seenl,
With all their pleasures, all their cares,
Now vauish'd like a phantom dream
The long gone years, the long gone years !
They've cycled their threeocore and ten,
For all'theirjoys, with all their teari,
I would not live them o'er again.
The long gone years, the long gone years!
They've sundered nearest, dearest ties,
Fronm all that this brief life endears, '
For one sweet joy-a thousand sighsr.
The long gone years, the lonuggoe year!
They've chill'd the bloom of manhood's
prime,
They've ceased to wake life's anxious
UnJa tie beito d 4we.f
The long ,one years, the taog gone ye+, i
Now mingled with the countles past,
Yet they have brought no chilling fears,
To meet in humble trust the last.
The long gone years, the long gone yearse
I would not that a tear be shed,
Around the hearse, tlht graveward bears,
This casket to it's silent bed.
The long gone years, the long gone years I
With sadness oft, my bosom thrill,
Memory will shed t's bitter tears,
Until this throbbing heart is still.
The long gone years. the longgoneyears
At best, thee are fm mqore to come,
Life's twilight shadow now appears,
Deep darkang 'round my last cold home.
The long gone years, the long gone year!
With eheqnr'd changes ever rife,
8miles are but preludes to our tears,
And death's at last the night of life.
The long gone years, the long gone years !
With all their scenes and ehangings o'er,
Shall dearer be-as memory nears
The last sad change-life's elesaag hour.
The long gone years, thelonggoyes I
-What matters, tho' time swiftly dis,
When to Faith's napward eye appears,
A deathless life, Iyond the skies.
The long gongrevts, the long gone years !
Their sorrows'all in mercy given,
To wean us from tbis world of tears,
And rest our hopes,,alone on heaver.

more. His retirement is. no loss. I
Florida loses Simon B. Conover,
another carpet-bag man, who retires
to a deeper 'obscurity, perhaps, nn.
less John J. PItterson be excepted,
than any man who has ever left the
United States Senate. Conover, dur- t
ing. thy last year Or two, has become
finaencaily bankrupt, and has so little c
credit and respect that very few peo- s
piq like to be see in in his society, and I
im9k0hR5en. gO$ 6 often and shunned t

dedo . himselL Gordel is a: tall,
atraigbt, soldiedrly looking mra, whose '
face is scarred and seamed with the
terrible wounds received by him dur. I
lug the rebellion. He is one of the
most amiable men in the senate to 1
I et socially. He makes no speeial
pretense to oratory, but is a valuable
mao because of his close attention to n
411 the business details of the Senate. b
Like most Southern men he wears his y
hair quite long and combed back
from his forehead.
Illinois is at present debating who I
will succeed Richard F. Oglesby, or
'JDick" Oglesby asbhe is called. Ogles
fy occupies a seat on the. right of
8pener. Everybody in Illinois, every,
man, woman and child knows how
he looks. He is a rough good-a.
tared, easy-going man, who has nev.
er made any impression in the Seaite
beyond the general belief that he is a
good fellow. He spends the greater
portion of the time lounging in the
cloak-room smoking lazily with some
of his senatorial cronies. He has
never made any figure in debate, or
been identified with any legislation is
of any importance.

and that is to demonstrate that he is t
about the wildest man on the money ci
quesden In the country. He is a tall
broadasbhAldered, deep-ehested, fine a
looking man. He alwayesttracts the tI
attention of the visitors in the gal. c
leries. But lie has found, like many II
.other so-called orators on the stamp, nr
that the 'Senate is the gravd of all a

f voice, and his manner ie so quiet and
f contained that his most animated
i speech seem like merely the highest
Iorder of conversation.
e James B. Eustis, of New Orleans,
Shopes to succeed himself. He is a
, call, iquare-shouldered man, who is
a very fund of good living, and is as
thorough a man of the world as one
I, will find in the Senate. He knows a
e good horse, a good picture, and a
gooddinner. He has not made much
e of a mark in the Senate, on account
of the short time that he has been
- admitted to a seat. He has made
I but one speech of any account, and
1 that was upon the Mississippi levee
t question, which was a matter of in
terest considering the subject but
Squite tiresome. One of his peculiar
s ities is to wear a very small boy's hat,
and as he is a very tall, powerful.
[looking individual, it gives him ,
Svery rdiealods a.ppeara c. He' is La
* very weitl'hy uD ,, Io4;.ied
,above the ordinary Lonisai nt
goes.
The retiring Senator in Maryland
is George R. Dennis, He is a man
w~ho resembles the average stock-,
broker. He is 57 years old, but does
not look much over 45. Ho is a
bachelor. His occupation during late
, years has been genteel farming. He
was a retired physician before hbe
took up that pursuit. He is Mary.
land born, but with a Northern edu
ncation. His Senatorial colleaguesi
have been ahocked at Dennle's lack
r of dignity in the closing days of his
career. Hie has been working early'
and late to secure pledges from his
colleagues to vote for him in .the . I
organization of the Senate' for oer
geant-of-Arms. He is succeeded by
James B. Greome, a Democrat.
David H. Armstrong, who was
elected to All the vacancy made by
the death of Senator Bogy, will be
sueeded by a Democrat. Armstrong |
is a man who resemblesin appearance
Postmaster General Key. Armstrong *
is tally broad-shouldered, with I)on
gray heir, combed back short, add
full gray moustache, and whiskers of
medium length. He has' never at- j
tempted to make any figure in the
Senate. He has contented' himself
with simply drawing his pay, and
gossiping with the old boys who love
the good stories that are told 'i' thii
cloak-roa . '
I The next candidate for retirement
after the 4th of March;' loking1
through the States in their alphabeti
eatorder, is John P. 'Jos; of Gold,
Hill, Nov. Jones is a shbat, tbicket,
red-faced individual, with a pdles t
abot sone hundred and tweatyflve,
and whoe talkinl` gauge a rnopup
to three hundred words a mlaute. He
