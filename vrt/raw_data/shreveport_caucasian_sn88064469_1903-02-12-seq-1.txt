TEDDY'S CRANIUM K
a
INDICATES A FIGHTING, BEAR- a
KILLING, FOOLHARDY MAN. tl
C
Physical Defects Pointed Out by Bill b
Arp-The Difference Between d
McKinley and Roosevelt.
a
An enthusiastic admirer of Bill Arp e
and the Atlanta Constitution, one of the c
best newspapers in the South, has hand- a
ed the Caucasian the latest letter by a
Bill Arp which he desires to have pub- f,
lished for the edification of the many
who do not but should peruse Bill Arn's f
letters in the Atlanta Constitution. "To jtI
me," he said. "Bill Arp writes according c
to my notions. I have been reading a
Bill's letters for years and I delight in y
his style of ripping up things in ien- a
eral. He is thoroughly a Southern :nar tl
and I wish he could live and write for h
ever." With this deserved compliment h
as a prelude we give Bill Arp's leatr tl
and here it is: a
"A little more grape. Captain Bragg," c
said General Taylor at the battle of p
Buena Vista. And so we say now to r
Captain Teddy. "A few more niggers tl
to offices *up North and a few more to h
our Southern postoffices. Go the whole n
hog while you are at it. McKinley gave g
you a starter by appointing a negro over t
a white community at Hogansville, and n
another at Athens, the cultured college a
city of the South, but he got alarmed t
and took the back track. It was just such g
a case as you have now in Mississippi t
at Indianola. for the' people of Hogans- e
ville went four miles to get their mail t
rather than take it from a negro-a c
dirty politician." Teddy has done no c
worse on the postoffice line. The post- t
offices are the people's not the presi- t
dent's. They are almost as near to us and .
as sacred as.is our preacher or our fain- a
ify physician. No greater insult, no t
greater outrage upon our right could be ,t
perpetrated by a tyrant than to appoint
a negro as postmaster in a white cori- s
mnunity. The difference between Teddy s
and Mr. McKinley is that the latter I
played fool for a while and quit, but &
Trddy keeps it up and grows more de; t
flant of Southern opinion and Southern
indignation.s. Sometimes Providinfce af°
flicts the people with a fool, and su e.

A medical friend from over the line I
writes me that he has a growing sense
of lasticet and abounds in sympathy for I
our lo suffering people, but Teddy's t
deformity does not come from original
sinr ai total depravity, but from physical
defects in his anatomy. and says:
"I have studied his cranium and find I

speech at Charleston and another in
New York, in which he says concerning
the right of a state to secede: "If we
accept the judgment of modern students
and investigators it would seem as if
the weight of argument falls into the
Confederate side. The issue was settled
by might and not by right." Then why
don't they pension our soldiers and pay
us for the property they destroyed
and ask our pardon besides. Four gen
erations! Old John Adams, John Quin
cy Adams, his son Charles Francis Ad
ams, and now Charles Francis, his son,
and he is 70 years old and has been
forty years finding out that we had the
-ight to secede- and they had no right to
free our negroes without paying fur
.them. Besides all that, this Adams took
charge.of a whole regiment of our run
away negroe, to fight us with. Lew
Wallace did the same thing. Yes he did
worse. He was president of the court
that tried Wirz and convicted him and
hung hint on perjured evidence. The
longer I live the more I am convinced
that as a general rule the smartest men
are the meanest-especially the politi
cians. Think of Henry Ward Beecher
preaching from his pulpit that Sharp's
rifles were better than Bibles to convert
the slave owners of the South, and so
his people bought the rifles and the am
munition and told old John Brown to
go ahead. But the niggers were loyal to
their masters and wouldn't burn nor kill
nor destroy. And hence Lew Wallace
and Adams and many others armed all
they could muster up and joined the
grand army and marched them down
upon our helpless women an children.
At that time there were 3o ooo runaways
up North--fugitive slaves-,-the meanest
of the raid and nobody but an unprin
cipled dlg of a man would have led
them agaiat us. Down further south
the negregn mixed with gentlemen and
were true -n thful during the- war,
and as Gfneral Henry -R. Jackson said,
they' ouht to have a monument built
to theii loyalty as high as the stars.

'Te4 W-;n;the Jsring comes and the
birds begin to sing and the flowers to
bloom tady be I will write more loving
letters, and if Teddy will retract and
ftpologize for the lies he told on Mr.
Davis I will let him alone, considering
that his cerebellum is limited by the
medulla oblongata and the sinciput.
I never read the modern novel. They
come and they go and are. forgotten;
but Miss Pettus of Alabama sent me
the "Princess of Glendale," and I reluc
tautly took a glance at the first page and
got caught. I turned the leaf and read
on and had devoured one hundred pages
before breakfast and all of it during the
day. It is a faithful and charming re
cital of Southern home life on a big
plantation before the war. Then the war
codeb, with its .distrvsses, the 'Forrest
with three hundred men pursues Stract
with fifteen hundred and captures him,
and Miss Emma -anson figures as a
heroine in guiding Forrest across the
river, and 'then comes thg sad story of
Sam 'Davis, `the typical thern hero.
Materest never flags in the beautiful
story, and it will be a landmark for our
ehildten and our children's children, for
it is faithful to the trsth of Confederate
history. BILL ARP.
P. S.--The Constitution is mistaken.
Williams, who made that beautiful
speech in New York,~ was not Northern
Williams. but Southern Williams. He is
from Missouri, and said "'we of the
South." Not a Northern man except
Charles Francis Adams ...aid a kind
word for us and he left out Mrt. Davis.
If he had said what Watterson said or
what Southern Williamns ~said he could
not have gone Tiack to Boston. -B. A.

the ex-slaves when thousands of men
in the North, hums and dead beats and
camp followers, are drawing pensions
from the government for which the
South must pay, its full quota of reve
nue? If the slaves were pensioned, the
money received by them would be ex
pended in the South and would help to.
up-build the South as the pensions of
the Federal soldiers in the North con
tribute in a great measure to the wealth
of the Northern states. It would be good
policy to force the issue on Hanna's bill
as it would practically develop the
hypocrisy of the Republicans' love for!
the nigger. Every Southern representa-..
tive should stand for the bill to pension
the ex-slaves of the Southern States.

SWITCHMAN KILLED
Charles A. Ray the Victim of a De
plorable Accident.
Thursday night at about 7:35 o'clock
Charles A. Ray, a switclhman, was
crushed to death by a switch engine in
the yard of the Vicksburg, Shreveport
and Pacific in this city. In ,attemptink
to jumnp- Ray's foot was ag in the

THE AMERICAN BRIDE.
.There is a difference, it seems, be
t tween the American. bride and the bride
t of other countries. The American worn
an adapts herself to changed circum
a stances more readily than any foreigner
e can do. As the wife of the farmer or the
f capitalist, she acquires rapidly the man
ners of het-, station. Such is the view
Il taken by a writer on the subject of
r brides in the February Cosmopolitan,
whose article is illustrated with a dozen
a floe photographs of lovely woman in
her wedding dress.
STASSFURT INDUSTRY.
The pamphlet "Stassfurt Industry," '
just published, contains an interesting I
description of the famous potash mines
in Germany, from which all the potash
imported into this country and used for
manunring is derived. The chapter about
the use of potash in agriculture as one
of the important ingredients of a com
plete fertilizer add& largely to the value
of the book, and among the many fine
illustrations those showing the experi
Sneits at Southern Pines, N. C., are of
particular interest to practiqal farmers.
