IN in the right side, under the
edge of the ribs, increases on pres. - I
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie W
on the left side; sometimes the pain No
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with '
lax; the head is troubled with pain, P'
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen- I"
erally a considerable loss of memory, "
accompanied with a painful sensation eI
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight, ti
dry cough is sometimes an attendant. II
The patient complains of weariness b'
and debility; he is easily startled, his Ce
feet are cold or burning, and he com- hI
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although h
he is satisfied that exercise would be so
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely tr
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy. I
Several of the above symptoms attend
the diseace, but cases have occurred re
where few of them exi;ted, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.

DR. C. MCLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN k
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of Ný

or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and II
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled. I,

S [N, O. Picayue 26th.] tl
0 The entertainment was opened by p
8 Mr. Luckett, who attempted the her
culean task of persuading the caucus. re
S;to adopt his resolution to scale the da
I debt to fifty cents on the dollar, with qi
4 per cent.. interest. From such a
simple proposition as this the deli, l.
berations took a wild acid uncertain
turn. Before any one could well ap. at
preiate what was the question pend.
ing, the caucus found itself discussing
the threadbare subject of "Shall ci
the conference resolve itself into a c
caneua with thle understanding all ac
f ion taken shall be binding upon
every one present t"
Lest an unintentional wrong be in c
ilieten upon some of the speakers who si,
discussed this point, their remarks at
are hot given. But from the well be
knowni views of Messrs Luckett, Kidd, p<
Caffrey, Bridger and Brian, a correct J1
estimate can be formed of the sub
stance of the addresses. The deci
sion upon this point was tle same as
heretofore reached, and that is that
sixty.eight members may carry
through tile Convention any proposi- w
tion they may agree to, without the tli
o assistance of those who opposed it in ga
the caucus. Under this ruling Mr. wu
i. Luckett's resolution fell to the ground iu
with a force altogetlher unexpected fr
by its author. C
f Mr. Forman next advanced to the w
front with a scheme-to submit tihe
o mnajority report and tihe proposition et
to pay tihe face of tile debt with four gi
per cent. interest to thle people to be hi
etvted on. Tie proposition receiving II
d the highest number of votes to be. at
come the law.
- While tdis motion was under dis
0 cession, Mr. McConnell took occasion
1. to warn his fellow Democrats against
n allowing a split in the party. He
told them, what they all knew, that E:
the Republicans were waiting eagerly
for an espected disruption ot the
i- Democratic party, and it was this
e hope which had kept the Republicans
is together.
* There being such evident opp'sI
tion to the motion, Mr. Forman withS
y drew it, subject to call.
I Propositions to be voted on were e
t then declared in order.
, M-. Ogden's resolution, to acknow!
- edge the ente-bellum debt, and to
t, pay as much of the debt contracted
since 1865 as wonid with tile former
r amount to $7,500,000, to be paid to
Stile iolders pro rata, was tile first ti
victim offered up for sasifice; ayes is
t23, noes 57. I
Mr. Oliver endeavored to cat the
Gordian knot by prop ,sing that the '
face of the debt should be paid, with '
o 2 per cent interest for three years, 3
for five, years, and 4 per cent. there
ºf after. Some twenty-one gentlemen ti
d thought the idea a good one, and so tl
e- voted, but fifty.eight declarini other
n wise, the proposition was laid aside.
Mr. Chiapella brought forward a
e" scheme to pay the principal, but withl ,
Sno interest for eight years, after u
i which 3 percent would be given for
is ten years and 4 per cent. thereafter- h
I yeas 18, nays 57.
Mr. Leake asggested paying the
Spuincipal, with 2 per cent. for fifteen a
years and 4 per cent. thereafter, Losta
by 51 oays to 25 years.
I" A vote *as then had on Mr. Bell's
e moton to pay the faCe of the debt,
a with 3 pet cent, for ten yeatrs sopd 4
.V thereafte'r-yeas 2, nays 41. "
* The climax in the performance wa
reached ihen Mr. Satherlina urged
Yi upn the absemblv that it was their
sense that, came what may, the prin- r
cipal of tie debt should be redoced. I
U munhappily it was an' error of judg
ment on thie part of Mr. 8otherlin,
for the eueos disagreed wit hi bn by
Sa vote of 43 nays to 33 yeas.
as A motion by dome gentlhmaa to pay
is the debt as it stands, with 7 per cent.
Le interest, was not pased very energeti
e cally, oand no vote was taken on it. a

THE DEAD PRINCE. of
Exelitement and Sorrow Over the ti
News from South Africa. to
ati
PAlas, June 20.-Intelligence of co
the death of the Prinee Imperial, in th
South Africa, was received here with
general incredulity, and some of the th
early editions of the papers ppblibed de
the rumor with scofling allusions at me
it improbability. Subsequent di.- Ti
patches dispelled this delusion, and b
the effect produced by the news was an
deep and widespread. Even the rad- tie
ical Republimans expressed sorrow at g
the death of the Prince., The agita- lei
tion of the Imperialists and Bonapart- is
iats was intelnse. The questlion as to
the succession to the claims posel e
sensed by the young Prince are now
generally discussed. If the provisions TI
rormulated by the first Emperor and tie
reasserted by Napolean III for the e1
transmission of the hereditary rights arl
to the imperial crown re preserved ib
the succession wilt fall on Prince by
Jerome, the second consin of the tc
Prince ; but it is impossible, in the foi
opinion of the Imperialist party to
r unite that body in any. morement in'
favor of Prince Jerome.. f
The news of the death of tho Prince ti
hIs besee so recent that anything vi1
like aosentrated action among tie of
b Boenapartists Ihas been hiposaible. At of

promting the interes's of the Re- l
publican.candidate, at the same time t
keeping prominently i view the hope r9
of tie restoratioo of the empire with tr
Sthe son of Jerome as its head, This
Printeeo has in his veins the blood of t

sentiments, it is thought, can be in ,
