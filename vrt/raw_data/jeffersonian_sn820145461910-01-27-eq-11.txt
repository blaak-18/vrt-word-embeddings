Denmark Now a Wealthy Nation
A century ago the Danes were
•among the poorest of the people of
Europe. Today their per capita
wealth exceeds that of France, Hol
land, Norway, Sweden, Germany, or
any other country on the continent.
This great advance is but an index
of an equally great increase which
lias taken place in their popular in
dustrial intelligence and efficiency,
and also of the development of a fine
national spirit and soeial morality.
Their success has been wrought
from a poor soil under the stimulus
of adversity. Denmark is a low
lying country between two cold
bodies of water —the Baltic sea and
the German ocean. The winters are
long, the growing season short. Much
of the soil is sandy and poor. The
Danes undertook co-operative bacon
curing—one of their important in
dustries—only after Germany re
fused to admit their live hogs. At
an earlier period they were forced
into dairy farming by the failure of
grain farming. The reasons for their
success may be roughly classified as
follows:
First—The extensive use made of
expert advice.
Second—The granting of aid by
the State when the people have un
dertaken some worthy enterprise for
themselves.
Third —Thorough systems of test
ing market products and of educat
ing the producers.
Fourth—The wonderful develop
ment of co-operative organizations
and the prevalence of the co-opera
tive spirit.
Fifth—The development among
the Danes of a high degree of popu
lar intelligence, a fine national spirit,
and a social morality.
The Danish farmer often prefers
to seek advice from an expert in re
gard to what many would consider
an ordinary farm matter.
For the breeding of live stock
there are three kinds of experts; for
Jutland cattle and sheep, for horses
and for red Danish cattle and sheep.
There is also a consulting expert in
England.
If several farmers wish to purchase
a bull that will improve their herds,
they ask advice of the Government
expert. Even in the breeding of
their hogs the individual farmer is
likely to ask expert advice. The
Government furnishes the services of
its experts as readily as the farmers
avail themselves of them, but there
are not sufficient for the demand.
The people, through their co-opera
tive organizations and federations,
through their agricultural societies,
poultry societies, etc., secure expert
aid for themselves in many other
ways. The result of this practice is
evident in the rapid improvement of
their live stock and in the steady in
crease both in the quantity of milk
and the percentage of butter fat giv
en by cows. In a number of herds
the quantity of milk given annually
by each cow has in a few years been
increased 100 gallons or more. Even
the (frequently considered) disa
greeable task of milking becomes
with them an art to be studied un
der an expert. Accordingly, men
who have had years of experience in
milking take lessons in the art of
milking according to the Hageland
method—a method which increases
the quantity of milk and the percent
age of butter fat. This reliance upon
the scientific method and the expert’s
advice is shown in the loyalty with
which the farmers adhere to the se
vere restrictions upon the individual,
often imposed by the creameries, as
to feeding cows, handling milk and
milk cans, and in their readiness to
furnish information in regard to their
own cattle or hogs. As a result of
this habit of co-operating with the
State experts, swine fever, once a se
rious matter, has been stamped out
of the country. Everywhere the ef
fort is made to bring the highest in
telligence procurable to bear on the
problem in hand.
Severe personal economy also
Ob?
brings its results. Herds of cows are
not allowed to wander; each cow is
hitched and allowed to graze a little
portion until the portion is eaten
clean. Thus land is made to feed
a far larger number of cows than
ours—for loose cattle trample and
destroy more than they eat. Cows
are milked three times a day. At a
certain farm at Kolla-Kolla, each
cow has over its stall a tin plate
bearing its record as a milker and
breeder. At the end of the year the
cows whose records are poor are dis
carded, while the calves of whatever
cows have given rich and good milk
are kept for the farm. One cow on
this farm—by no means a show cow
—produced 500 pounds of butter in
a single year.
State aid to agriculture takes nu
merous other forms besides the sup
plying of the services of experts.
There are the usual grants for agri
cultural education, for premiums
and prizes at agricultural shows and
fairs. There are numerous money
grants to voluntary organizations fox*
the improvement of cattle, poultry,
etc., and to local and national agri
cultural societies. Besides these,
there are various prizes, grants and
loans for the superior cultivation of
small holdings and to ambitious and
meritorious workers in dairies and
creameries who desire technical edu
cation.
There are also Government loans
to those desiring to purchase small
holdings. These are made at 3 per
cent, and the borrower repays the
original amount in small install
ments running through sixty years.
The Government also lends money to
neighborhood credit societies or co
operative banks, which lend, again to
the farmers on favorable terms for
the purchase of seeds, fertilizers, etc.
In starting co-operative creameries
and bacon-curing factories, the farm
ers are able to borrow from these
banks the full amount of money
needed to start their enterprises, on
the personal security of the mem
bers, each of whom assumes full lia
bility for all the debts of the con
cern, “jointly and severally.’’ The
confidence that they thus manifest in
one another, the courage of the thrif
ty folk in assuming such “joint and
several liability,’’ and the confidence
of the bankers in the business ability
of the farmers, all indicate very

O, well! you will see.
John, does that statement that you
gave The Journal that there were
1 16,000 members in the Union tally
with the dues as the secretary re
ported? The Savior said, “He that

rest. If you are ashamed of such
statements, resign, John, for you
can’t face the boys and hold up your
head.
Brother Watson, one thought:
Do you think a man pure gold who
would sit as a judge, and, after he
had empaneled a jury, exclaim at
the top of his voice, “I am a friend
to John Doe,” the defendant? Some
one else may have been eating beef.

county Union, I became very unpopu

make no effort to disprove my con

sometimes.
What a foundation of principles
our organization has, if we could
just keep the goats off the top rail,
