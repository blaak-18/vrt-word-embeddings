Pain
Weakens
Headache, rheumatism,
neuralgia, or pains of any
nature weaken the sys
tem—they are a strain up
on the nerves. Almost
instant relief can be ob
tained by taking Dr. Miles
Anti-Pain Pills, and with
out any bad after-effects.
Take one on first indica
tion of an attack—it will
ward it off. They are a
pleasant little tablet, sold
by druggists everywhere,
25 doses 25 cents;
never sold in bulk.
I* l as su bj e . c t to constant head
aches for a period of four years. At
times I was almost unfitted for the
work m which I am engaged, that of
station agent. Through the advice
of a friend I tried Dr. Miles’ Anti-
Paln Pills, and the result has been
that I have entirely eradicated my
system of those continuous headaches
that follow a continual mental strain.
They have done for me all that is
claimed for them.”
