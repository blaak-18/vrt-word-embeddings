The Glory That Is Ours
LATE in the month I have just
read the “Glory that Was
Greece,” in the Jeffersonian
Magazine for May, and with wet
lashes have closed my eyes to dream.
The bees of Hymettus drone in my
ears; the nymphs are dancing in the
groves of Daphne, and the music
from the pipes of Pan float over the
sea to the argonauts of the golden
epic to “Arms and the Man Tossed
by Fate.” Soft winds ripple the Ae
gian waves and the columns of the
Accopolis gleam in the radiant sun
shine. The distance of time lends its
mystic enchantment. . . . All that
Lord Macauley embalmed in classic
English and all that Kingsley gath
ered together with loving considera
tion for posterity greets us again in
“The Glory that Was Greece,” and
once more we dip ourselves in the
soft waters of Greecian idealism. Be
fore this men have immortalized
themselves in laying laurels on the
tomb of Greece, and if Mr. Watson
never penned any lines but those un
der consideration they should form
for him a chaplet and a name.
On the eve of resigning the vice
royalty of India Lord Curzon hung
in the Taj Mahala splendid lamp of
exquisite workmanship, bearing only
the name of the donor and the date
of presentation. So long as the glory
of the Taj shall last so long will the
name of England’s regent in India
be remembered. So should Mr. Wat
son’s classic immortelle preserve his
own name and fame. . . The dream
has vanished. The bees and butter
flies hover over broken columns; the
myriads are no longer visible in wak
ing hours; the argonauts have gone
down in the Sea of Time and the
pipes of Pan are choked with dust
and silent; Sic transit! And all that
we have left of the “Glory that Was
Greece” is in the Immortal Ideal that
she set for us in the days when the
world was young and the spirit of
man brave and free!
Now—how many who have fol
lowed Mr. Watson’s effort and doc
trine, as embodied in his spoken and
written words, have realized that his
dream of civic perfection could be
realized only in bringing our coun
try up to the Athenian model! How
can the average commercial and po
litical mind grasp the purpose and
hope expressed in his beautiful trib
ute to Athenian populism? What do
the men who “run” things for us in
these our times know of the Athenian
republic? If they know aught what
do they see in it of use to present
day needs and conditions?
Some of us at least can see to what
point Mr. Watson would bring our
country—our Southland especially:
To bridge the ages and the seas; to
remodel and restore; to shape and
educate, to inspire and instruct —to
build and recast, until we shall see
here on our soil a glory akin to
Greece, a republic without shame, a
people of purity, honor, and intelli
gence; and achievement in somewhat
else than the commercial greed that
ate the heart from regal Rome.
What better model can we find for
our home, our school or our civic in
stitutions? The Greek ideal of
Beauty as expressed in physical per
fection, mental poise, euphonious
language, glorious art and classic ar-
Gfce 3cffersonlan
chitecture should be the ideal of
every American. A contemplation of
the Good, the Beautiful and the True
in heart, mind, tongue, home and
school as embodied in the Grecian
model will eventuate in a higher
civic standard no less noble and in
spiring code. Such a course of dis
cipline will more surely help to re
establish in our own land the ideal
condition; will more certainly bring
back the age of Penelis; will more
positively reassert the Glory that was
Greece than will any other course
now open to consideration.
Our boys—our girls—what do
present conditions, present methods
hold for them or promise for them?
But a study of the past will reveal
future possibilities that the present
does not guarantee.
“Lives of great men all remind us
we can make our lives sublime” —
and so reproduce in our own land
the glory that was Greece.
It may be that we shall never real
ize this ideal, for no nation has ever
rebuilt itself on its own ruins, and
the South has lost much she will
never regain, but an ideal never real
ized is better than no ideal at all, for
even an unrealized ideal may serve
a just and holy purpose. If all we
can do is but to gaze upon and love
it we shall be inspired ever to some
thing nobler and great and closely
akin to it.
From afar —do we still look upon
and love that past age that has sprin
kled some of its glory even upon
this? Today’s sun, yester night,
bathed in amber light, the stately
ruin, the perfect art, the glowing
richness of that other world, and
now transports some of its richness
to us, the coarser children of anoth
er clime —children whose age is not
embellished by the legacy of any oth
er land as it is by the glory that was
Greece —the veritable Peter Pan of
all true nations—the land that will
never grow old nor feeble nor use
less, but will ever breathe the spirit
of immortal youth!
Turn backward the glance over the
lapse of time and refresh at its per
petual fountain the craning energy,
the decaying purity, the diminishing
justice of our civic heart.

DISGUSTED WITH DEMOCRACY.
To the Editor of the World:
As a Democrat I am disgusted with
the actions of many of the Demo
cratic members of Congress in deal
ing with the tariff question. If the
Democratic party has ever stood for
anything it has been for a low tariff
and free raw materials. The last
Democratic platform made a specific
declaration in favor of free lumber
and free hides. Yet in spite of that
declaration we find it repudiated by
quite a large number of Senators
and Representatives. I wonder if
the Democratic party will ever have
a man in the Senate big enough to
stand and fight for some definite
principle—some man who will take a
national view of things from the
standpoint of the national welfare
and not be influenced in his action
by some petty local interest that
hasn’t got gumption enough to stand
upon its own feet, but wants to be
propped up and supported by the
rest of the community.
Os course the Democratic Senators
who vote for a protective tariff upon
lumber, hides, iron ore and other
things know that the whole infernal
protective tariff system is a steal,
and why they should be willing to
sell out their Democratic principles
for a portion of the loot for their
constituents is incomprehensible to
me.
Here is Senator Daniel voting for
a tariff upon a measly little pica
yunish industry of gathering tanbark
simply because tanbark is raised in
his State. Here is broad statesman
ship for you! Here’s devotion to
Democratic principles! Here’s the
trading of a political birthright for
a scrawny little mess of tanbark pot
tage that nobody ever heard of be
fore Senator Daniel abandoned the
Democratic platfrom in support of it!
And here are Senators Tillman
and Bailey voting for a tariff upon
iron ore on the ground that they do
not want to help the Steel Trust,
when as a matter of fact the Steel
Trust controls about all the avail
able iron ore in the country, and the
effect of the tariff will be to make
it more difficult for the independent
steel manufacturers to compete with
the trust. I rather expected Bailey
to do this because of past affiliations,
but for Tillman to do it shocks me,
as I have looked upon him for years
as the personification of Democratic
principles.
The Democratic platform declares
for free lumber, yet Democratic Sen
ators can be found who will vote to
increase the cost of every home in
the land simply because their states
happen to produce more or less lum
ber. And thus it goes. Democratic
Senators not only stand by while the
Republicans are preparing to com
mit legal burglary, but are willing
to assist them in the act on condition
that they will get a share of the
plunder. Were it not for the group
of Republican Senators from the
Middle West who are taking the po
sition which the Democrats have
abandoned I would despair of any
relief from traiff exactions for years
to come.
Oh for a Democratic leader at this
crisis in the affairs of the party who
will be big enough to rally the great
Democratic party to the honest sup
port of Democratic principles, who
will call attention to the treachery
which is now going on at Washing
ton, and demand the punishment of
the traitors! The time is ripe for
such a leader. Mr. Bryan is in a po
sition to assume the role. Will he
do it?

Pig Errantry.
The report of the cattle market
committee, presented at Colchester
Town Council last week, contained an
item as to a pig straying, followed
by, “Resolved, That the town clerk
communicate with the offender,
warning him against committing any
offense in future.” It was touching
to hear that penitent animal giving
its word of honor that nothing of the
sort should occur again.—London
