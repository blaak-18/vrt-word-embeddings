TO BRAD WYNN, OF WILKINSON
COUNTY.
November 19, 1907.
Mr. B. Wyfin, Toomsboro, Ga.
My Dear Mr. Wynn: In looking
over some old files, your letter of a
year ago passed in review.
Whenever I think of Wilkinson
county, the names that pop into my
mind are those of Captain John T.
Lingo, Captain Mason, Henry Clay,
Frank Cannon and Brad Wynn. The
heroism displayed by those loyal
friends who stood their ground in
those dark days engraved their names
upon my memory so deeply that they
will never be forgotten. It is very
sad that so many of them died while
the clouds were still low, and the
wind was from the east. It is a pity
too deep for words that they could
not live to see the triumph of the
principles for which they fought and
suffered. I am glad, however, that
such men as you and my gallant old
friend, Captain J. A. Mason, have
survived those cruel times, and can
congratulate themselves that you
were faithful when so many weak
lings gave in. Nothing would give
me greater pleasure than to see once
more every comrade who stood by me
in those days, and take him by the
hand, and talk of old times.
Your friend, as ever,
THOS. E. WATSON.

A SAMPLE COPY IMPRESSED
HIM.
Keyser, W. Va., Nov. 26, 1907.
Dear Si£: I am a young man, being
born since the Uncivil War, but from
Southern stock —a rebel, a Democrat
and a free trader. I want to write
you and express my appreciation of
a magazine I happened to find on the
counter of one of our news dealers,
edited and published by you.
The Jeffersonian, to my idea, is
the ideal magazine of the day to any
young man that wants-light on the
affairs of his country. Tn it a
“spade” is called a spade, and the
vital questions are couched in plain
language, so any one can understand
them. Long life to the Jeffersonian
and its editor. I don’t believe in
placing all the flowers on the coffin
of the deceased, but give them a few
of the fragrant roses before they
pass away.
Yours very truly,
V. F. ATKIRE.

warm for a Republican.
