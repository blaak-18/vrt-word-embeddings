A lutelligent ambot,
Under our government there is no
necessity of feeling the effects of in
justice. There is not an ill but what
can be righted by the ballot. That
weapon can fall as lightly as the snow
Sake flla upon the sod and leaves a
mantle'of purity over all the earth, so
ean the ballot fall and ollilercte these
deeds of injustice. hitherto the work
Ingmnen have been satisfied, and have
felt that their allegiance was due to
one of the old parties: but both of the
old parties have turned to plutocracy.
I do not believe it will be necessary for
the people to wait another quarter of
a century until they find thin out. I
believe this fall there will be a strike
such as this country never saw before.
They hava prepared the shackles for
the laboring man throughout the
length and breadth of the land, but
the people are awakening, and the day
for the laboring man is coming. An
indlcpendent. intelligent ballot is need
ed, and I believe we will get it
throughout the length and breadth of
the land for "the right is marching
on. "-labor is marching on.-Eugene
V. Debs.
The Electlon Returas.
We met at Reelaville, Ind., the other
night anl appointed ia man to carry
the results of our efforts to the county
headquarters as soon as the vote sl
counted in November, according to the
suggestions in the Nonconformist.
Now let every precinct in the United
States do the same thing and our party
will get the benefit of our vote, as we
will then know how many votes we
have polled. Let every precinct re
port to the county chairman as quickly
as a horse can carry him, if there is no
wire. Let every county chairman wire
to the state central committee at once,
and they to the Nonconformist. We
are bound to astonish the old parties
when the vote is counted. We'll land
the old ship of state in a safe harbor
In spite of the banks and bonds.--Cor,
Moneonformist.
THE TWIN FRAUDS.
They Have No Fixed Principle Save as I.
ordlnete Greed for Onee.
Here's richness for you. Just read
this which appeared in the Associated
press disprstches: "('ongressional cam
paign committees of blotii parties have
advised eandidates to use their own
judgment as to the silver question in
the coming campaign."
This lets the cat out of the bag and
exposes the whole hypocritical plan of
ct'.mpaign of the two old frauds. They
have no principles on the silver ques
tion and the only object being to get
votes and ofiee they instruct their
eandidalpt to play fast and loose ao
eording t circumstances. In districts
where the sentiment is strongly
for free Jlver they are to pretend to be
for that. In districts where the major
ity is for the single gold standard, or
"wait-fo~lEurope" scheme or delay, the
candidate is to favor that humbug.
Anything to get in and all things
to everybody. In Ohio the demo
crate dlared In their Mate plat
form for free silver at the ratio of 16 to
1. In T'xas, the week before, they deo
elared  r exactly the opposite doc
trine. I New York the republicans
declaredbgainst free coinage. In Col
orado tis week before they declared
for free.'.oinage. So it goes-no sin
eerity, no honesty, nothing but vote
estching humbuggery. On the con
trary, n a populist platform in the
United tes but what declares une
Squvoca for free silver coinage at the
old rat. , without any ifs or ands.
Every nn wbhohe '~tiele of per
ception n plainly see that the popu
list is ae only party in this country
that prepeaes to deal farl wtb, the
people on this gret lssue.-Noneon

of a modification of the law which
places a 1 r cepad. taxu apos all issues t

parties,but if the states were alowed
to issue serip, 'r non-interest bearing a

would be bette ofo than they are now.
But why these·sZinarks? Out in Nebras- i
