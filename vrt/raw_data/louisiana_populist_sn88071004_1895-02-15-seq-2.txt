All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a bid before
advertising. The Populist is be

support it. Also those who enter

coldest day of the season so far
and the wind must have reached a

have been on the loor of the 3en

would not have had such a severe

appcars that the Democrats have

"Look at this picture of over Mtt
years' rele by thfiwld partes Meil you
willee why I am and, if you are t'm
why you thould be a pepulist:
First. In 1862 congreea passed an act
depreciatlng the people's money by
robbing.it of its full legal teager quali
ties, therent depreelating its value
about one-rd and increasinga te eonm
of proseuting the wir h the a;nm
ratio, which added millions to the e.*,s
of the war; all ot which was a clear
steal from the people by the gold-bngs.
Socond. Alt the behest of the gol
bugs, afte the war had closed, qan
gres passed an sat to contrqgt the
people's money by giving bonds for the
money and sendljg the people dboi to
a gold basis, which increased the tib4,
and lessened their ability to pay tlo
debt in'tbe ssme proportion.
Third. In the year 1869 oongrrss
passed the cred5 sten'gtheming act,
which chanred the natre of the peo

Fifth. 'After the people's debt h~l
