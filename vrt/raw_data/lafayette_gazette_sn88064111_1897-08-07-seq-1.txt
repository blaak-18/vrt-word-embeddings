OL.. V. LAFAYETTE, LA., SATURDAY, AUGUST 7, 1897. -N-- 2
Fi IRE. McENERY RECEPTION.
The Daily-St r -s.
A remarable spectacle is to be preserted
tot4he -American people in this city at the
Urand Opera House to-night. That spec
• taclc is the rejoicing, the exultation of the
rank and file of a great political party over
the defeat of its chief principle and mea
sure by- its opponents; the glorification of a
man over principle; the triumph of a State,
boldly brasened, in a game of spoliation and
robbery. Into this rottenness has the fruit
of the tree of liberty ripened. Does it
portend the greatness, the honor and moral
height of a sovereign State? Or is it the
srsf degradation and the decline of the
party of the Constitution? Have we reached
a depth of the degradation wherein the
cuckold triumphs and rejoices in his shame
and humiliation?
The morning papers publish the official
call for a meeting at the Grand Opera
House intended to do honor to Senator S.
D. McEnery. Quite a formidable list of
vice-presidents are appended to the call,
some of whom we know to have been placed
" there without authority.
Itfthis meeting were designed simply to
do honor to the Senator as a man and one
filling a high position, we should as heartily
as any man endorse it. " But unfortunately
such is not the case. It is to be, not a
gathering to do honor to a man, but to
do honor to a politician who, in a trying
period of his party, deserted his colors and
'his natural allies and went over to the en
emy. body and boots. We can take part in
no such meeting. We can commend no
-such disloyalty to principle and party.
. We fully understand the incentive to this
remarkable demonstration, the first and only
one of its kind in this or any free country.
That incentive was the degrading assump
tion, as widely spread, that Federal legisla
:tlon is a game of grab and that every fellow
-should get away with as much of the plun
der as his superior audacity and skill may
enable him to secure. This degrading view
of Federal legislation is widespread and is
poisoning all the pure and generous streams
of public' and private action. When men
reach the conclusions that there is some
-thing better worth than life and honor;
when they can stand on the street cornets,
in club rooms, Senate houses and public
-meetings and say damn your principles,
let's get all we can, as is now the case, the
foundations of the civic structure are rotten
Tahd the whole structure is hastening to its
ruin, and let Christian men and women, and
high-minded, honorable men or women,
bear it in mind asan incontrovertible fact,
that when the politics of a country are
rotten; in other words, when politics are run
on the lines of slxpilation and pelf, the cor
ruption soon spreads to social and co:lnmer
c'al life as well. Is the Choctaw Club, as
it pretends to be, a promoter of Democratic
principles, or is it, as the call for this meet
ing would indicate, the promoter of the pro
position that robbery is the first and only
object of federal legislation?
This government in its origin was a feder
ation of republics, each having sovereign
power over certain well-known subjects of
legislation, all others beinlg specially dele
gated to the general or federal government.
Among these latter was the power of taxa
tion, more especially of levying tariff duties.
Thus the governments and legislatures of
the different States have jurisdiction over
questions and policies appertaining to the
local interests of the States, while the
President, Senator and Representalives of
the Congress have exclusives legislative jur
isdiction over all subjects of interest to and
affecting all the States and all the people,
and it is the sworn duty of every Senator
and Representatives to legislate on the
highest and broadest grounds of justice to
•the whole country, and he is foresworn if
-he sells out the balance of the country to
se,:ure some especial benefit for his particu
lar State or district. No man can dispute
this prosposition; no honest man will at
tempt to dispute it.
That Senator or Represen tatives, there
fore, is recreant who, to secure what is
termed protection for some class or classes
in his own State, joins in a general raid
upon the earnings and comforts of the mas
ses of the people of the whole country.
Again, there are now two parties in the
country. One is the Democratic party, the
object of which is to preserve and promote
.the principles of our Constitution, which are
-the preservation of liberty, equal rights to
-all and the protection of life and property.
The other is the Republican party, the oh
ject of which is to overthrow our free insti
.tutions and government and establish in
Itheir place a-mighty Plutocracy, or moneyed
aristocracy. This latter could niot and can
anot be done by any usurper or any armed
force, and so the protection system was in
stituted, by whose silent and unseen, but
rkesistless and inevitable operations the- mas
..4 of-the Isple are robbed of their earn
tags for the enrichment of the few, and the
ipoor are made constantly poorer and the
rich richer. Out of this system of legisla
Ston must inevitably emerge the despotism
of money.
lte therefore, who stands for the Demo
crattephinciple of low and equal taxation
satnds for the perpetuity of the Republic,
: who soartands for the robber or' protec
- satm sttaadsfor a qeonaYrta rstocracy
with its iron heel upon the necks of the
poor, extorting the blood tax from the
widow and the orphan. He who stands for
a tariff strictly for revenue only, stands for
the Constitution; "for equal rights for all,
special privileges for none-" He who
stands for protection, as the Choctaw Club
will stand to-night, stands to transform this
Government from a free Republic for the
benefit and happiness of free people into a
confederation of robber States, each strug
gling for the larger share of the spoil and in
which liberty and justice and honor must
ultimately fall and be lost.
No man in the meeting to-night, held to
celebrate the deflection of an honored pub
lic servant from his Democratic ties and to
rejoice in the triumph of protection over
Democracy, can refute the principles we
have laid down in this article. These prin
ciples, in the language of the immortal Jef
ferson, "form the bright constellation which
has gone before us and guided our footsteps
through an age of revolution and reforma
tion. The wisdom of our sages and the
blood of our heroes have been devoted to
their attainment. They should be the
creed of our political faith-the text of civic
instruction-the touch-stone by which to try
the services of those we trust; and should
wander from them, in moments of error or
alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps and
to regain the road, which alone leads to
peace, liberty and safety."
A Sudden Rise.
The butchers have raised the
price of meat and now the peopled
of Lafayette are compelled to pay
twelve and a half cents a pound for
it. And all this because the
butchers don't like a municipal
ordinance which says that they
shall pay a certain amount to the
meat inspector. The ordinance
provides that every butcher shall
pay to that officer "a25 cents for the
inspection of every beef or cow,
and 15 cents for every yearling,
calf, sheep or hog."
Heretotore the butchers of this
town have been selling meat at to
cents a pound and the sudden rise
to twelve and a half cents was a
genuine-surprise, to say the least.
An increase of two and a half cents
per pound on meat will prove quite
a hardship on the people of this
town. At any rate many will ques
tion the wisdom of the means
adopted by the butchers to show
their disapprobation of a -law.
They undoubtedly have a right to
try to repeal any law and they may
have the right to sell their meat at
any price, but their patrons will
hardly be impressed with the justice
of being made to pay two and a
half cents a pound more for meat
merely to express their displeasure
provoked by the passage of an or
dinance.
Married.
Mr. Florestal Guidry, a well
known young gentleman of this
town, and Miss Pearl Fleming of
New Qrleans, were joined in wed
lock Wednesday evening at the
residence of Mr. Felix Landry by
the Rev. I. T. Reams of the M. E.
church. The ceremony was wit
nessed by a number of the friends
of the young couple who are very
popular among the young people of
Lafayette. Mr. and Mrs. Guidry
have the best wishes of a large
circle of friends for a long and
happy life.
The Election Case.
In the absence of any decision
from the Supreme Court on the
writs of certiorari avad prohibition
taken by the defense in the election
contest, the case was not called up
last Monday for trial. As the time
of the special term has expired, the
election case can not be tried be
fore September unless another
special term is ordered before that
time.

local disciples of the immortal
Blackstone allowed their lower
limbs to be elongated to the extent
of several dollars in good, hard

The L. S. U.
The Gazette has received from
Col. Thos. D. Boyd, the catalogue
for 1896-7, and announcements for
1897-8 of the Louisiana State Uni
versity and Agricultural and Me
chanical College, located at Baton
Rouge. This year's catalogue is
particularly neat and interesting.
We notice with pleasure the addi
tion of the Sugar Course to the al
ready complete curriculum of .the
University, thereby making six
courses of study, literary, mechani
cal and agricultural. Several new
instructors were added to the splen
did faculty, which has labored so
zealously in the past to make our
State University the noble institu
tion it now is. The physical train
ing of the cadets will be in the
hands of an able manager, whose
policy will be to encourage clean
college athletics. We cannot here
but touch upon the grand work
which the State University, through
its able corps of teachers, has and
is accomplishing, but we believe it
our duty to do all in our power to
advertise that good institution,
which unfortunately does not re
ceive the support it should from
the State; and that of every citizen
to work for its aggrandizement in
order that the State shall be forced
to recognize its needs.
The State University is supported
by the State, and for that reason
should be dear to every citizen.
Cadets attending the university have
to pay only for their board and a
few other incidental expenses, as
the tuition is free.
L. S. U. is particularly a public
institution; every tax-payer has a
share in its maintenance and should
see that the educational centre of
his State receive proper support
and encouragement. Its new presi
dent,Col.T. D. Boyd, has successful
ly completed the session of 1896-7,
and we have no doubt, that under
the supervision of this advanced
educator, next session will be an
unprecedentedly profitable one, and
that in a few years he will have ac
complished for our State University
what he did for the Normal School
at Natchitoches.

Champions of Southwest
Louisiana.
The once proud Champions of
Washington made a courageous
fight for supremacy last Sunday,
but they bucked against the wrong
nine. They did their best, but
what could the poor boys do when
confronted by such crack players as
Hilderbrand, Huff, Lynch, Mar
lowe, Euing, Letty, Bulah, Bob
Broussard and Felix Mouton. They
had won a few games over inex
perienced country nines and it was
natural for them to think that new
honors awaited them on the dia
mond, and candor compels us to
say that they acquitted themselves
with considerable credit of the ar
duous task of holding down the La
fayette Dixies. The Lafayette boys
displayed a very commendable
spirit of magnanimity in allowing their
opponents to make a few runs,
which served to lessen the bitter
ness of what would have been an
ingnominious defeat.
The game was called at x o'clock.
Frank Zernott of the Washington
nine and Paul Castel of Lafayette
were sworn in as umpires. The
game lasted about two hours and
the score stood 12 to 19 in favor
of the home boys, who had one
more inning which was not played
as the Washington players wanted to
leave on the afternoon train.
The Champions had traveled a
long distance; they had braved the
excessive heat of a hot July day,
and a shut-out would have been a
death blow to base ball at Washing
ton. And that the Lafayette boys
wanted to avoid. After consulta
tion they decided it would be more
;n consonance with Christian civili
zation to let them down easy.

A most delightful afternoon was
spent by the members of the Ladies'
Five O'clock Tea Club on Thurs
dlay at the home of Mrs. T. B.
Hopkins. After the adjournment
of the business meeting a pleasant
programme was carried out-a
reading by Miss L. Mudd, beauti
ful instrumental selections by Misses
Gladu and Perkins and a pretty vo
cal solo by Miss Winn. On re
pairing to the dining room deli
cious refreshments were served. A
"Palette Party" terminated the
evening's pleasure: In the tit
among Mrs. B. Clegg, Mrs. Bios
sat and the Misses Mudd for the
prize, Miss L. IV udd was the fortui
nate one, and to her a lovely cen
tre-piece, the exquisite handiwork
of Miss Susie Hopkins, was given.
No one regretted having braved

was gieater than the anticipation.
W'elcomed guests of the evening
were Misses Winn and Perkins;

The First Bale.
H. Gerac & Bros. ginned a bale of
cotton yesterday afternoon. The
cotton was raised by, and belonged
to, Jack Nickerson. We believd
this is the first bale of cottori
ginned in Louisiana this season.
We are i iformed that Joseph
Billeaud has already harvested
enough cotton to make up a bald
but has not yet had it ginned.
Base Ball at Pilette.
Two very interesting games of
base ball were played at Pilette oil
the 3rst of last month. the first
game was between the Welcomes of
WVhittingon's Cove and the Pilettd
Juniors, and the second between the
LeRoy Red Stockings and the
celebrated Union Club.
At x o'clock Umpire J. IH. Co
meau called the Juniors and the
Welcomes to the diamond and the
game began. At half past a o'clock
when the last inninig had been
played the score stood 16 to I in
favor of the Juniors.
At 2:45 the contest between the
Red Stockings and the Unions was
fairly on. At the endl of the sev
enth inning the scorers announced
that the Unions hal scored twenty
two runs and their opponents only
two.
Immediately after the second
game the Pilette Juniors challenged
the Red Stockings to a three-inning
game which was accepted; it re=
suited in the Juniors' defeat, the
score being eight to five against
theni.
A ball was given in honor of the
visiting clubs. It proved a very
enjoyable affair. Miss 'Marie
Broussard was awarded a beautiful
gold ring as a prize for faultless
dancing and Mr. L. Labbe was the
recipient of a walKing tane as a
recognition of the fact that he was
the best gentleman dancer in the
ball room.
The Uniofls will cross bats with
the Carencro club at Oak Avenuie
Park at 4 o'clok to-morrow.
