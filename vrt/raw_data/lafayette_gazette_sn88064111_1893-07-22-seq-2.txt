SMUST GET TOGE THER.
Lt can serve no useful purpose to
 ide the fact that the people of La
Fhayette are not working with that
-muity and fixedness of purpose that
:'achieve results.
Every one, we believe, is fully
alive to the needs of the town, and
have, in the main, the desire to see
the town get those needs. But
some how we can't get a ha:monious
pull.
In the mean time opportunities
are escaping from us. This won't
do.
Lafayette has had several tow
:-jtines out. They have either parted,
or there were not enough willing
bands to, hold fast and pull in, and
consequently several opportunities
that *rould have enhanced the pros
perity of the community, to a cer
tain extent, have drifted away.
It would be a loss of time and
space to recapitulate.
-The people of Lafayette might
as well put on their thinking caps
:and look the situation square in the
'"Ã½'ace, and ask themselves seriously :
Is the progress and prosperity of
the town such as her magnificent
situation and resources entitle
--her ?
By a little personal sacrifice and
a willingness to put a shoulder to
the wheel, would the town not be
higher in the scale of prosperity?
And if she is not occuping the
position that she should, that her
natural advantages intended that
-she should, who is to blame?
Around us we have seen what
civic pride and a perfect accord
among the people have accom
plished.
Is the example worth emulating ?
If so, get together.
ABOUT RICE.
In bulletin No. 3, Rice crop, 1893,
issued July 15th, Messrs. Dan Tal
mage's state: seeding completed and
the crop prospering finely, still the
fruition is dependent on a happy
conjunction in temperature, mois
ture, and clear skies at its "taking
$" or harvesting period. The
total acreage of the United States
is 62,5o00 acres; estimated yield
1o,625,ooo bushels. Reports from
the Atlantic States are of satisfactory
character: acreage equal average
past decade. In Louisiana the
progress of crop has been intur
rupted by dry weather in many
localities, but by recent wide-spread
and continuous showers the plant
has nearly recoveied, every seperate
seeding showing to relative advan
tage.. They note a counter current
against the culture of Sugar Cane
and that rice is the chosen crop:
due to the fact that the latter is an
nual, cheaper, and sure, while cane
auough holding out the promise of
larger reward is an exotic; requires
time to establish; is more expensive
to cultivate; is attended with greater
risks and perils on acccunt of being
an exotic and always liable to ad
verse National legislation. Planters
.are also acting more independently,
Sborrowing little and many altogether
-xefuse advances against their crops,
1laiing it is better to make less
np aad.own it, than make a larger
s and hlave it owned by or under
control of another. There is a
niderable amount of old crop
o ot n ahand but the general deter
i~2 tion is to hold all of desirable
sracter for enhanced values which
expected to follow improved
etary conditions.
- IVJLL BEAR INVESTI
GA TING.
40aighboring town, some days
"The Gazette's attention was
forcibly- at the same time
t-y, fixed upon the splenidid
- e of the streets which had
tly worked. One street
, extending along a dis
rly half a mile, was strik
ceable by its evenness
tre it sloped down to
etviag a- uniformity in
  perforce, arrested
. All of them, were
- tt, the best worked,
-t%-' ~ . -1
and promise the best practical re
sults, of any streets that we. have
[heretofore seen.
The stretch of half-mile worked
street, noticed above, was put in its
present fine condition at an expen
diture of just Sg9, not considering
the machine, the amount being paid
for labor and team. One of the
other 'dlreets, of about the same
length, worked two years before by
the old methods of ploughing, spad
ing, shoveling, dirt barrow's, etc.,
and which gave for less satisfac
tory results, had cost the corpora
tion $ So.
The road machine, used by the
corporation to-day, and which we
have seen gave the very best results,
is very simple in construction, with
detachable parts. Any angle
wanted can readily be secured by
simply moving the adjustable screws
and the blade can be moved beyond
the wheel so as to'reach and touch
the 'curbing. It is strongly built,
and its parts are interchangeable.
The authorities of the town of which
we write are much pleased with its
workings and feel they have found
the solution to the question of how
to keep the streets of a town in good
practicable condition. Consider
ing that this machine has been
tested in clay land and given such
good satisfaction, it should certain
ly, in The Gazette's judgment, give
the very best results in sandy loam
land, such, for instance, as the
streets of Lafayette.
The cost of this machine is be
low $2oo. And to investigate its
claims would cost but little, if any
thing.
Humbuggery of Humbugger.
Mr. Editor-In your last issue
an article appeared signed by one
"Humbugger" setting forth in rath
er pettish and peevish language sev
eral complaints against the Police
Jury, Grand Jury and District At
torney, and the present system of
road laws. With one fell stroke of
the pen, l'Humbugger" has solved
the road problem, indicted the par
ochial authorities for negligence in
the administration of public affairs
and inflicted upon a suffering and
suffocating public the harrowing de
tails of a - "mule-colt" story. The
sad disappointment experienced in
early life has doubtless so obscured
or narrowed Humbugger's mental
vision that he can scarcely view men
and things other than through his
"six-inch lane." So puerile and
pessimistic is the spirit df the article
in question that but for one most
ridiculous and preposterous charge
no attention would be justified.
'-Mr. Arceneaux went before the
lawmakers asking them to have the
road opened, the result was they
laughed at him." Humbugger ad
mits right upon the heels of this
charge that whenever he spoke to
the lawmakers he "always had a
good word, but no road opened."
No fair-minded man would make so
gross and unjust a charge against a
body composed of right, sober
minded and reasonable men, all of
whom, with one exception, are of
mature years and experience. The
Police Jury, on the contrary, has
accorded to every person who ever
came before them the most respect
ful and considerate attention, even
when private and personal interests
were involved rather than matters
of public concern.
The writer has attended every
session of the present Police Jury
since its organization in x888, and
can truthfully say that no such un
seemly conduct as "'laughing at
him" ever disgraced its legislative
deliberations. The gentlemen who
constitute the Police Jury may have
their quota of human weakness and
shortcomings, but that they ever ri
diculed an officer or citizen who ap
peared before them, for the presen
tation of any serious business piop
osition, is so utterly preposterous
that had Humbugger reflected a
moment he would not have made
such a statement.
Taking for granted that Humbug
ger represents the people of the 1st
ward that the "six inch lane" refered
to is a public road and that the
Police Jury continues "to laugh at
him" would not the natural conclu
sion, of the entire matter be that
the "gods help those who help them
selves? Mr. Arceneaux's duty as
roadoverseer at the time, was to
proceed under the law, and remove
all obstructions to the road in ques
tion, But Humbugger and others
will wait in vain for the parish
authorities to intermeddle in private
and personal disputes over surveys
boundary lines etc. between neigh
bors. It appears vcry singular in
deed that a petition of some fifty
citizens should be addressed to so
many different authorities and yet
obtain absolutely no consideration.
If the road is necessary for public
traffic a personal representation to
Mr. Alfred Delhomme Police Juror,
of the ward "on a petition addressed
to the Police Jury at its next sitting
will certainly receive prompt and
considerate attention. Let the mat
ter be presented fairly and squarely
before the Police Jury and if Hum
bugger doesn't get that mule colt
of his he may then go out and per
form the Judas Iscariot act. Of
course the public are not concerned
in the glatty grievances of every dis
gruntled individual but as Humbug
ger propose a revision of the road
laws and offers some valuable sug
be i;ion; as to taxation, road notices,
etc. it might be well for him to ap
pear before the constitutional com
mittee soon to convene and give
them the benefit of his advice as
well as to relate that very funny
mule colt anecdote. Give us an
other next time friend Humbugger.
SCRIBULUM
Where Are the Jetties?
Mr. Editor-A luminous contri
butor to the columns of the Adver
tiser of July x5, in an article under
the caption of "Outlets," says:
* * * that the source of the stream
which has been clogged up with the jetties
and so forth, is utterly incapable of carrying
the restless volume to the sea.
Would it not be wise to send a
copy of that article to Jthe "ped
greed" engineers of the government
so that they may know the location
of the jetties ? As long as they re
main ignorant of this fact, their ef
forts will be futile, and the *"expen
dition" of millions complained of
will be of no benefit to the people.

Mr. E. P. Bascle of Houma will

Mr. J. M. Jones on Pecan Grove
plantation.
Mr. Pierre Bernard has been quite
successful with his peach crop this
year. Your correspondent is under
obligations to Mr. Bernard for a
quantity of the choicest fruit.

Dr. J. P. Francez went to Abbe
ville several days ago, called in con
sultation to attend Mrs. J. M.
Beauxis who was very sick.
**
On the fourteenth, the patriotic
Frenchmen of Carencro celebrated
with great enthusiasm the anniver
sary of the fall of the Bastile. With
a Frenchman, there is no adversity,
and no prosperity that can destroy
that great and glorious love of
Mother Country, the feeling that
predominates in every patrioitc
heart. The fourteenth of July is to
them, what the "4th" is to the
American. It marks the anniversary
of the day that brought freedom and
happiness to a noble, if downtrodden
class It was one of the principal
events in history that taught the
people their power, which they were
not slow in exercising. Is there
anything surprising in our French
population celebrating a day that
meant so much to their race xo4
years ago.
The celebration was a great suc
cess and heartily enjoyed by those
who were present. The grand stand
of the race track formed a most ad
mirable place for the spreading of
the feast, which was of the very best.
There was a perfect good fellow
ship pervading all present, and
gaiety reigned supreme. Prof. L.
Tappissier, delivered a very brilliant
address, citing the reasons that con
trolled the French, and prompted
them to assert their rights. It cov
ered every point of interest and kept
his hearers spell bound during its
delivery. He concluded with a
eulogy on America and Americans
which was received with rounds of
applause. Doctors F. ,V. Courtney,
J. P. Francez, and W. VW. Lessley,
and Messrs Bedau and Albert Guidry
made a few remarks appropriate to
the occasion. After each address
the great gun would "boom" forth
a salute, and taken it altogether it
was a very successful and pleasant
celebration.
**
Mr. Zerang of the Teche, passed
a few days this week with Mr. Adam
Sonnier.
Mrs. E. W. Glenn, Miss Emma
Jones, Messrs Geo. E. Brown,
Geo. Melchior, and Mr. Meyteyer
left last Saturday for Chicago, to
"do" the Worlds Fair. It looks as
if Carencro is goingeo be very well
represented at the Exposition.
That very popular and genial
young gentleman Mr. P. D. Alpha,
was in town last Sunday, visiting
friends.
The Carencro Union Ginnery
Company are building an extension
to their gin building, which is to be
used as a meeting hall.
**
Mr. G. L. Singleton can, truly
claim to jhave the fitlest pair orchard
in the parish, your correspondent
received from him a number of
pears measuring eleven inches in
circumference, and weighing 12.
ounces each. It is an admitted fact
that Mr. Singleton has the finest
crop of cane in this vicinity, and
yet all crops are in a first class
shape.
While Lafayette and New Iberia
are drawing straws .to see which
shall get the road to Breaux Bridge;
do not be surprised if Carencro gets
the prize. In fact the matter has
already been placed in the hands of
a committee of the Carencro Pro
gressive League. This committee
is composed of men who know how
to go about accomplishing a thing
when they want it. They talk very
little, but work like beavers. Once
more, "keep your eyes in this direc
tion." We feel sorry for you, but
it is really not our fault. Our peo
ple can not stand quietly by and see
Iberia give us another "black eye".
As soon as this road is built or com
menced, we will pick out a nice
healthy location for the Court House.
Mr. A. C. Guilbeau went to New
Iberia and St. Martinsville last week.
Some of our farmers claim that
there is every indication of an early
arrival of the cotton catterpillar.
The marriage of Mr. Ludovic
Guilbeau and Miss Ida Crouchet is
announced for the 29th of this month.
I Mr. Guilbeau is the son of Hon. A.
I. Guilbeau of Breaux Bridge; is a
very worthy young man, much ad
mired and very popular in our com
munity. Miss Ida Crouchet is the
youngest daughter of the late Mr.
Jacques Crouchet who was one of
the first settlers here. The young
lady is a sister of our Merchant and
Post Master Mr. Henry Crouchet.
She is very charming, and one of
the leaders in our social circle.
Prof. Chas. Heichelheim will
commence a private school on the
st of August, and continue until
the opening of the public school.
Misses. Nydia and Alida Camp
bell the two charming daughters of
Hon. 1~m. Campbell have been
spending some days with the family
of Dr. J. P. Francez
A juvenile base ball team from
(;rand Coteau came to town last
Sunday met an untrained team of
Carencro boys, won the game of
course, and returned home with
shouts of joy. Our boys must
practice up, and wipe out this
defeat. TOTIDEM VERBIS.
A Conference.
The Gazette was pleased to meet
Thursday Dr. H. P. Guilbeau, who
informed us that with Mr. Charles
Babin, they had been appointed a
committee by the citizens of Breaux
Bridge to meet a committee of the
Business Men's Association of this
place, and both committees in a
body would hold a conference with
Mr. Kruttschnitt, the superintedent
of the Southern Pacific railroad
company with a view of talking over
the building of a railroad branch
between this town and Breaux
Bridge. The Gazette tried to get
the details of the conference but it
was thought best, for very good
substantial reasons, it is claimed, to
withhold all mention of what took
place.
