RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.
A few days ago that broad
minded journal, The Times-Demo
crat, commented upon a fresh case
of religious persecution reported
from Monroe county, Miss. With
a few more papers like the T-D. re
ligious fanaticism and puritanism
would soon be at a discount in this
country. It never misses an ap
portunity to speak words of con
demnation of the fanatic's work,
thereby calling the attention of
fair-minded people to the outrages
which are committed in the
sacred names of religion amn of law.
The following is the special which
called forth the timely editorial
from The Times-Democrat:
'Aberdeen, iftss., May 29.
Mr. John Nash, a Seventh-Day Ad
ventist, was yesterday arraigned in
Justice Rye's court, at Amory, in
this (Monroe) county, on the
charge of working in his field on
Sunday. Nash pleaded guilty and
undertook the management of his
own case, using the Bible for his
law book. He keeps Saturday as
religiously as a priest keeps Sunday.
The case was continued until the
second Saturday in June.
"The Mississippi statute bearing
upon the subject, in section 1291,
provides that -'Any one who shall
labor on the Sabbath day at any
other than household duties, works
of necessity or charity, oi an rail
roads or steamboats, shall, on con
viction, be fined not more than $2o
for every such offense."
By working in his fie!d on Sunday
John Nash has invited the deadly
enmity of a few sanctimonious fools
who have a peculiar style of serving
the Lord. It will hardly meet with
the approval of sensible people who
are Christians at heart as well as in
name. If the Seventh-Day Adven
tists choose to keep Saturday as the
Sabbath and do their farm work on
Sunday, in What way do they inter
fere with the rights of the other
creeds? Things have reached a
pretty pass when a man can not hoe
his corn or plant peanuts on Sun
day without being dragged before
the courts as a common criminal by
a lot of religious cranks.
WVe do not know any of the peo
who are persecuting the Seventh
Day Adventists in Mississippi; but
we will venture to say that they
have not half as much religion as
the victims " of their hell-born
hatred. The man who presecutes
his neighbor on account of religion
is mnse dangerous than the anar
chist. The latter is an open enemy
0o society and is an outlaw, while
the former pretends to be a meek
follower of Christ when in reality
he is an emissary of the devil.
The Supreme Court's Decision
Against the Income Tax.
Springfic!d Republican (Ind.)
The newspapers of the large cities, the
centers of wealth from which radiate
the great influences of wealth, with
very few exceptions, hail the
decision of the supreme court in the income
tax case as a triumph of liberty and justice
over an attempt to distribute some part of
the federal taxes according to wealth. They
also as a rule treat the decision ss a finality.
This is strangely overlooking the final source
of political power in the nation. The su
pre:ne court, it needs hardly be said, is but
one of the branches of a government estab
lished by the people. What the will of the
people is in regard to the income tax hias not
yet been determined. We onlyknow that in
both houses of Congress the tax proved to be
perhaps the strongest feature of the tariff
law. Republican conventions were signifi
cantly silent about this act of an opposition
majority in Congress. If the tax was odious
only a very few people appeared to think so
strongly enough to say so. It it was social
istic the mass of the people represented in
these State conventions seeme4 to be
socialistically inclined. Laws in the end
will shape themselves agreeably to the senti
ment of the mojorlty of the people. They
make a great mistake who think to findf in
the decidaon of the stpreme court the final
word against the so-called socialistic tenden
cies or the moment. The people, whether
for gmod or ill, will speak that word. The
constitution of the ,United States as it has
been left by the income-tax decision of the I
supreme court cannot safely be permitted to
stan I. There are two good and safMelent
reasonS fo? amending it, in the absesee of
any certainty that the court's interpretae6on

CONDUCTED BY THE LAFAYETTE W. C. T. U.
Intemperance and the Catholic
Church.
Rev. James M. Cleary.
During the past twenty-one years
the Catholic Total Abstinence Un
ion of America has done n;,ble and
heroic work in the cause of sobriety
and public decency. But with our
.ten millions- of Catholics, this grand
association should number instead
of sixty thousand, six hundred thou
sand members. If our church coun
cils -are to be heeded, if the utter
ances of the sovereign pontiff are to
be respected, if we will not turn a
deaf ear to the repeated appeals of
our best and wisest prelates, there
must be a new awakening among oiii
Catholic people against the wither
ing curse of drink.
Our Catholic people expect too
much from the church if they enter
tain the delusive notion that the
church can save weak men fjQm
ruin while her own children, by
their voices or their ballots, do not
aid in diminishing or removing the
occasion of sin. There is not much
consistency in applauding the de
crees and admonitions of our church
councils in theory, and in practical
life withholding our suplport from
the influences that make for the re
alization of what the church incul
cates.
The church, by the united voice
of our bishops- assembled in the
third plenary council of Baltimore,
warns its members against the
dangers of the drink habit and the
temptations of the saloor,. The
same council warns our Catholic
people against the business of sa
loon keeping as "an unbecoming
way of making a living." A man
cannot be a good. Catholic, a loyal
follower of the teachings of the
church of this country, and be a
good friend of the saloon. Much
less can a Catholic be a saloon
keeper and a dutiful child of the
church. We should at least have
the courage to follow wrere our
chief pastors lead, and our Catho
lic loyalty is not above supicion if
we are not as ready to condemn the
drink evils as our bishops, who
have been placed over us "to rule
the church of God."
The drink curse shields itself be
hind false theories of science, and
many have been deluded by - the
false notion that alcohol is bene
ficial to health. Forty-four states
of this union have by law made the
teaching of true principles of tem
perance compulsory in our common
schools. Too much importance
cannot be attached to the practice
of inculcating habits of total .ab
stinence among children and our
boys land glrls during the danger
ous and trying period of youth,.
- If oqur prelates, priests and people
join hands together to work in har
mony and strenth for the realization
of the admonitions of our plenary
Icouncils, the awful curse of intem
perance can be almost entirely
raidicat4d from among us. We
j must encourage, then; our total ab
-tinetce" hBcieties by every means
at -our ."'omm i and. We ptiests,
