* OUR WASHINGTON LETTER. du
WAuAsnilGTON D. C., Jnue 1, 1 7.t
The Democratic National Cornit- out
tee was in senssion liere yesterayIv. It dilI
appeared to he the gerical belief oft hit
its iiieumbers that theIe would be coni- et;
siderable gailns by the Democracy itI 'te'
Conigressiounail I)istricts this Fall. The
followiing tesolutioln was tihuli iioiS
ly adopted : sli
Resolved, T'lhat the action of the ( ^,t
House of Reprj selaiiales in appoin'Lt oult
ing a Coniiiittee tully eltioIlOeted toI thy
investigate Iand report u1 then tI irands 1m'1(
alleged to have beetn conulitte' in 111
the late Presiderntial election, to the bot
end that the t rol Iunimy he made t
known to the people, and ti ll- repeti
tion of suclih tuds he pieveinted in of f
the future, meets with the al proval of1
this committee."
Mr. Potter's investigatiing Coniuit
tee will probably organize to-day.
Such action has been delatved at the ele
request of the RIepublicans became wa
one of their number was absent froiin wa
the city. It is still undecided wheth- the
er or not sub-C('omanittees will be litve
sent to Florida niid Louisiana, but all
mostlikely they will be. a
Under the resolution of Mr. Wilson, or
of West Va., authorizing the Comiit- g
tee, if they have probable cause to jh
believe that frauds were committed,
in other States besides those mention- k
ed in the original resolution, to in-km
vestigato them, may enlarge the la- (c
bore of the Committee. It is a cut
rious fact, by the way, that oniily a tt
few Republicans voted for this exten- tht
sion of power, though they had all th
clamored for days for the Hale amend- rth
ment. lrl
The Senate Committee on appnro.
priations yesterday reported the Leg- p'
islative, Executive and Judicial bill. Tei
Every economical provision of tihe thl
House bill was eliminated, and the
amount miade greater than last year. i
There will be conference conmmittees
on this bill, and I hope thie House
will sit until the next Congress meets
rather than yield. The House did u"
not propose any reduction that it t
ought not to stand by. It did niot,
in fact go far enough. To yield now,
and on this bill, which is the most
important of appropriation bills be- III
cause if economy is enforced in this
it will naturally follow- in all the
others, would be criminal. It wouiild
be forming a partnership with. the T
robbery and extravagance which
D)emocratic miembers were elected to
correct. Let Speaker Randall take
the floor again on the subject.
It has been apparent for some timne,
and was made certain by thie action
of the House on Wednesday, that our
army will not be less than 25,000 at
men for the next two years. Thie tv
solid Republican vote was for that ce
number, and the Texas IDemocrats
and a few others noted with them, in
This is too large ad army. The pos. w
sibility that hostilities with the of
Indians might occur at any time, and se
the uncertainty of our relations with NJ
Mexico, are the two influences wihich ai
operated to prevent reduction. While a
these influences present a decent ex- pI
cuse for the votes of Democrats wbo id
acted on this subject with Republi
can, they have no such weight when jr
those and other Democrats cam'e to at
vote finally on other, appropriation sr
bills, notably the legislative, execn- tl
tive and judicial bill, mentioned above. is
There the necessary expenses can be dh
accurately foreseen and no general tl
interest would suffer greatly even if i
sums smaller than are absolutely ne- tl
cessary were appropriated. Bat tl
those who have carefnlly examined b
the subject think the appropriations [f
more than sufficient. e
Of the many Democratic represen- u
tatives who have 'won distinction in ii
the arena of the House, during the n
past 6 years, none have achieved a
more honorable distinction in tie <
service of country and party than Ia
Speaker Randall. His services to-the i
South, particularly, cannot be over- c
estimated. All conversant with the
dying struggles of Radiclianis during
the second session of the 43rd Ctiti
gress-rendered the more nutraciop
lo1 and desporate frow the -con
sciousnuess that their power to up srps
expired with the third of March igv 5
-still remember how lie hleld at 4
bay the whole "bloody-sliirt" faction,
striving to push through the infamous
force bill by which they hoped to ifill
hlold the sonlth In, negro and carpet
bag bondage. While the hearts of
others failed thenm and they were
ready to faint by thle waysaide
Randall by his forecast and indom
itable persevernoce was able' to con~
tinon the fight successfully till le
forced the enemy through sheer ex
hanation, to abandon the stag .
His genius and firmness on that e-i
casion inesred the tmancipatian 4of
the douth that came a few months
later. le hlis moved steadily on the
mark of his high calling since. To
no one man in the country more in
debted for the advance e s ej' in
the cause of good Govertt d
no one will envy him the ·

vices nor any further advancenient it
may have In store for .one. who has

N. Y. Times.
In. Ulster county, lately a jury of
eleven whito men and one colored inan
was chosen. The latter had for twenty
tive years been a slave. working in
the cotton fields of the south. He has
lived at Marlborough for several years,
anl by hard n work and economy hais
saved money and liilt it a home. Three
or four of thlie whiite jurymen, on learn
ing that a'"- nigger' was on the' panel,
immediately anniouncedl that they'd le
-if they'd serve," and wanted to
know "'what in -- this coiiutry was a
conling to when white men, born free,
were askedi to sit on a jury bench along.
side Jf a nigger'." About half of the epec
tators concurred in the sentiments of
the free-born jurors, and volunteered
the information that they would sooner
ro t in the coiiiunty jail than sit on the
benuclh with a darkey. The justice then
proceeded to call the names ot the absenu
tees, andl those failing to answer were
lined $15 for coiinteimpt of court, amnid
thie freely-expressed opinionus of the
crowd, who were "death on the nagur.'
Finallv thie colored man intimated to the
counsel that he wishedil to bie excused.
This was done, and the indilgnant free
maen took their sets. The tfiue for con
templt were not collected.

Siar tha, O eM@
Ti u l l ulBi ºtpblihes an
ac ittf wht 49aq aistrlgue be
tween anti-resolution Democrats and
certain Republicans..
The a:ticlo says the particulars of this
intrigue, as now developed, show that
with Mlessers. Mills of 'T'exas, Buckner
of Missouri, Morse of Massachusetts, and
several others of his side of the house,
Mr. Stephens was willing to go so fiar as to
amend the Potter resolution by inserting
a qlauso directly recognizing and em
phatically declaring the stability of PresJ
idett Hayes' title.&
The idea was to embody in the amend
minent lMr. Hewitt's somewhat emphatic
assertion or concession, that tihe title is
sacred and irrefragable. It is known
that the leaders of the Potter wing prom
ised to pass a resolution embodying this
declaration as soon as they had secured
the adoption of the one provided for the f
investigation. That they did not keep
their promise is also knuiown, and that
they did not intend to keep it is proven
by the fact that they have studiously re
fused to recognize any of the anti-greas- I
ers in ally way whatever. However this I
ma y be, the intrigue referred to had an c
indirect bearing upon that promise, and I
may have been the cause of it.
The Representatives who were engag. -
d in the movement were of the kind
known as administration men, and the
President himself was a party to their ]
consultations. It is known that on last
Thursday night MIessrs. J. D. Cox, '
Amos Townsend and one or two other I
Republicans, inmet the President at the
res 4enucm offippn. Chits. li'uEatsr, lbr the
- purpose of. ta-king this 'chatter over.
a 'They agreed that the offer of the Demo.
i crats was worth looking. im4o, and Mr.
t Cox was selected to d6te 1"looking.
MIr. Cox having reached the terms
a that were satisfactory to his associates as
II well to Mr. Stephens and his fellow ant
greasers, the latter to the number of
f twenty-two signified their earnestness in
e promises, by signing a written agree
e mnent to vote wihthe Representatives
- against the Potter resolution,, provided
- the Ropreeentattves wourtd juiu .with
e them after Potter's defeat, in a resolution
- tfirmning the irrefragabillity bf Hayes'
". title, and providing for a more liberal
ý- investigation.
if Mr. Cox on Friday, armed with this
Is paper, cautiously began to sound the so.
e called anti-administration Republicans,
0 as well as others of the party, who had
I- up to that ime been kept in ignorance of
n the istrigue. Among these was the
d Hon. Eugene Hale, whb istantly de
fl nounced the scheme as an ithamous at
n tempt to divorce the adumilqist14t31 from
r- the party. ,In his opinionitga suacoess
it would simply have thrown the president
IS into the h#ads of the Democrats, and
place himn under obligations to a mi.
aurity of that party for the preservation
of the. sacredness of his tenure of ofice.
Other Republicans who were ap
proached on the subject expressed aston

its mijleiberis, and having abandoned the

a- of securing to the President undisturbed

In short, Mr. Cox met with such
