ToNES BAYOU.--This outletl has
broken bounds again, and the
work, so lately and favorably
commented upon by the Shreve
port journals, has been totally
destroyed we understand.
We have not ventured an opin
ion as to the feasibility of this
work, but, from what we learn,
we are constrained to believe that
the closing of Tones bayou is a
Sirr4oiwa4oiity' It is,
which the Government can ex
pend a large amount of money in
furtherance of the noble art of
"public improvement;" and is es
pecially adaptdl to a counted in
House of Iepresentativos under
the usurpation of lHayes.
STnielected Radical officials of this
parish, perfectly sensible to local putb
lic opinion, are willing to recognize
Judge Pierson who was counted out
by the Returning Board and hoped by
this to lull all into the belief that
they mneant to recognize Nicholls who
was counted out also. We find, how
ever, that all of theln have filed their
oathg of office with Deslonde, the usur
ping secretary of State, since the 9th
inst.
Of course this leaves these felloirs
in the same condition as the other
usurpers.
, __ - =:---
In all this confusion that now ex
ists, no matter what the result may
be or how decided, the negro has
but one chance for himself in the
funture, which is, to cling to his South -
ern neighbor and friend for all that
makes citizenship and life.
The radical North has kicked him
loose and after all those glowing
promises from his Northern Repubh
liean friend the colored voter is
thrown back upon the Southern
Democrat for succor and support
theo Democrat the uegro has so long
and persistantly abused and wronged.

A SQUARE MEAL FOR F4FTY
'.EN'TS at ardicsk's Bardieg Uiouse.
A Demand.
Ioit. J. B. Elanm was elected to the
State Senate fromn this D)istrict in
1 7.1, and his seat. has been occupied
lhv the tlotorious' 'witchell under the
1ompt.on0se, with which the people
had nothing to do, but according to
theI terms of that comprom ise Mr.
Elam res'cred the riTlht f' cointest.
We denhmtI thereftor, that Mr. Elam
he satled in the Nicholls' Senate as
the legally elected member from this
)istrict, and w o demand that Mr.
Elain present himself to that Senate
and he sworn ill.
This, and nothitng less, can Mr.
Slaint do. lie has for two years been
quiet in his claims because he knew
that it would be folly to attempt an
assertion of rizhts before a Kellogg
body, but MIr. Elami mist show his
willingness to stand by the rights of
the people, and nothing less than his
being seated in the State Senate will
we ask.
If Mr. Elam does not do this, then
these stories we hear about some
crookedness in that cotmpromise,
which his enenlies have been using
against him, and which his friends
haoye defended hinm against, will be
revived with ten fohl vigor!

We give space elsewhere to a com
munication from Mr. Leon (.reneaut,
ex-Chief of Police, with regard to the
slanderous defiunation that appeared
in the Natchitoches Republican of last
week.
That sheet represents only the
vilest of the vile lot of radical oflicials
of this place whose reign of disgust
ing indecency and plunder is about
to end.
Ezernack, the business manager of
tihe concern, anxious no doubt to get
a little notoriety no matter how in
famtous, has been for two years en
deavoring to make the world believe
that lie was in danger of his life.
Such stuff is all nonsense. No one
ever thouglit of such small potatoes
as he. The "lulldoozers," who
ever they may be, are evidently on a
bear hunt and would not waste pow
der on so contemptable a skunk as
Ed. Ezeinack.
Besides this lie is a constitutional
liar, and there is not a decent man,
white or black, in the parish who
would believe him on oath. Let
Ezernack name the men whom lie in
sinnuates employed Horton to kill tad
icals. When he does this we will
begin to prepare a refutation of his
slanders.
We do not suppose there is a single
is an imlprovement onKellogg. "T e
legislation of one week was amply
sufficient to show the game these fel
lows ould play.
Every measure intended to curtail
expeniises whlich had been adopted by
the last Hlouse was repealed by the
lirnp legislature, and bills for the
benefit of Dinkgrave, I'inckston, and
other supposed martyrs, were passed,
appropriating thousands of dollars.
Courts were abolished, City Charters
amended; neacts rushled tlihrough to or
ganize a Militia force and $200,000
thousand appropriated therefor; Jury
laws revised so as to render the con
viction of criminals impossible, and
other monstrous schemes concocted to
carry out the plan to further plunder
an outraged and ruined people.
Happily for civilization and our
State, the bubble has bursted, and
these would be robbers are com
pletely fiiled in thleir attempt to des
poil under Packard, as tihey did un
der Kellogg and Warmouth.
We Ihave received the January
number of LEISURE HOURS a hand
somre mammoth 16 page (64 coluinhs)
family paper, tilled with the choicest
literature-serial and short stories,
sketches, lpoetry, wit, humor, &c., &c.
It is entertaining, amnsing and in.
structive, and is one of the cheapest
papers--the amount anrd quality of
matter cnsidered--thiat we have
seen. The price is $ 1. 20 per year,
including as premium a genuine fine
--line steel engraving, called " The
Mitherless Bairn," printed on 22'x 28
iplate plaper, which the pnblishers
clanim is superior it point of merit
and attractiveness to any premium
ever offered by any other paper in
this country, and is alone worthi the
imoney asked for both.
'rThe publishers, J. L. Patten & Co.,
162 William St., New York, author
ize us to say, that in order to intro
duce tihe paper in this viciniity they
make a special offer to every one of
our readers to send tlh.ei the paper
-a " t.ial tripll" of four months,
post-paid, coinmmnencing wilth the
January numbcr'---for 25 cents
Our readers who avail themselves
of this offer will, we feel certain,
thank us for having called their at
tentioo to it. The publishers of
LEISURE HOURS would like to em
ploy some one im every place to can
vass for this paper.
"THE meetings" o0 8thI January
throughout the Northern States are
reported as grand afftairs, and the
speeches, .resolutionsr etc., were
enough to make the rebel Grant and
his crew shake in their beets. When
the Amnerican people begin to arm
themselves and quit begjfini braitors
to cease their designs on thie liberty
ofa free people, these fellows will
"stop short" and not before.
The Situation.
Tihe situation in New Orleans re
mnains unchanged. We have made
during the week decided gains, and
had it not been for Grant's ambigu.
ous dispatch, which really meant
nothing, the Radical concern, of which
he is nominal head, would have col
lapsed. All the State is in the hands ยบ
of Governlor Nicholls, except the St. ยบ
Louis Hotel.
National affairs look gloomy stll,
and we are of the opinion that no
satisfactory result will be reached at
all. In that event, the fuiture must
decide what will be done.
We have nothing late to record l
from our fiiends in Sabine and Red
River. Mr. Abe Harris reports Sa
bine as standing full up in line with
her sister parish of Natchitocheis, and
on the question of Packard or War,
she takes the latter at once and
without hesitation.
Red River stands ready to (lie in t
iniutainance of an honest Govern
nment, and these nsurlpers will find
buht small consolation in the attitude
of Red River parishes.
Treason and its Effect.
The stories of Ben Hill arnd Lamar,
and their attempting to sell out the
Democratic party, are assuming an
agl" shape.
The attempted treason of a South
ern man is a subject painful to talk
of. We hope these stories have no
founldation in fact; nay we believe
they have not. Should it be so, then
the only serious loss to the Demlocra
cy will be that of two men, and the
momentary adrantage their rcereancy
may sire the enem!l.
In the way of treason, and the
abandonent of the right, constitution
al ground taken by the Democrats
that Mr. Tilden has been fairly and
legally elected, would be treason.
no man speaks for the South, be he
Ben Hill or L. Q. C. Lamar. Long
street should be to these men a mel
ancholy example of a man, more
powerful with the people, more popu
lar with the Southern fighters than a
thousand Hills or Lamars, who at
tempted to deliver the South to the
Radical party, and that too, long be
fore that party had forced us to drink
the cup of humiliation to its bitter
dregs.
There need then be no alarm about
"Arnold's" in the Sonth.
Let Mr. Iill or Mr. Lamar dare
waver in their firm duty--let them
attempt to pander to Hayes for power,
and the niche in the Pantheon of the
South their honored names now oc
and gratitude, they will receie from
the South--and the Southern man
who knows no dishonor, and disdains
temporary success at the price of his
fime, naught but contempt and cur
ses. Mr. Hill and Mr. Lamar had
better paunso before thley attenmpt
such a step if they have it in contein
plntion, for we tell them that the
grave of infamy and dishonor awaits
them in the end if they should take
it.

Editor People's indtlicator :
Having noticed in tihe Natchitoches
Republican of the 13th an article at
tacking me officially as ChiefofPolice
of the city of Xatchiitoches, making
me responsible for tile murder of Mr.
Garza on last Christmas lday, and the
wounding of Mr. Jonnson, it becomes
my duty both to the Democratic par
ty 'which it attempts to abuse through
mne and which I represent in my
humble capacity anid also to myself
to correct the statements made by the
Republican.
I do not write this for those under
standing the case, but for those who
ablroad might be misinfonrmed as to
tile condition of affair in our city for
the last eight months.
The Republican states that I took
off the badge of tile city Marshal ap
pointed y the Mayor last summer.
This I did do, but I never acted as
Chief of Police afterwards, as the
board under which I had acted had
no Mayor.
I did not prevent tihe Marshal from
wearing another badge and if lie did
inot it was his and the Mayor's fault.
I could not act under the new Ma
yor and consequently had I arrested
llortou in his Texas raids, I had no
authority before whom I could bring
him to be tried fir violating the city
ordinances.
I leave this case ini the hands of
thle respectable citizens of the city of
Natehitoches, who sitting one and all
as jurymnen, will, I am sure, acquit
nie in their own minds of tis charge.
knowing mie as they lo, and knowing
too .well mlie autlor of the article re
ferred to in the Republican.
Hoping you will give these few
lines a Ilace in your columns
I remain.yours respectfully,

The Southern Democratic Congress

with the hope of delivering a single

The Shreveport Telegram has been
reduced to the last leg in order to

Brown, of Vernon.
W\'e have heard of Browns, fronm
the Superintendant of Public Edluea
tion of this State Iup to that classic
individual whose soul is supposed by
the faithful to lie "'iiarIhing oil,"
anll they, one and all, appear to be
of that pireciolls lot of latter day
stumbling blocks, called "disiuterest
ed patriots."
Brown, of Vernon, coencides with
his nomadic iaimlesakes in all the
devious ways of taking what they
can get, whether entitled to it or not,
and in the precious "role of Irrab,"
Brown, of Vernon, took unto himself
legislative honors, and bated be it
spoken pay!, by reason of "an irregul
larity" comiliitted in the returns by
Wells and Anderson while engaged
in compiling that parish.
Brown was not liked in Vernon,
anid his parish had honored him at
the polls by casting two votes for that
noble cuss. Still Brown was deter
mined that the ruralites should not
be without his statesmanship ; whereo
upon Brown takes a seat in the Pack
ard rump legislature, with the pat
ent (bly Leonard, of Caddo,) state
nient that he "went in for the in
terest of the dear people."
Brown has, however, returned to
Vernon, so our dispatches state, but
it will be seen that Brown returns
and gives it up when there is no
chance to win. He will now claim,
in common, with all such barnacles,
that lie deserves credit for the spasm
of virtue stern necessity has driven
him to.
The next time Brown runs for any
thing in Vernon, we would advise
our friends to keep a close watch on
the object to which lie aspires, al
though we feel assuled that lie will
never in Vernon get votes eno:igh to
elect him even to a balitfs office ; lie
may, however, feel as if the gravity
of the situation (of Brown) called for
another heroic display of grab, and
take unto himself honors not thrust
at him by a willing constituency.
Brown, of Vernon, is now a noble
example of sublime necessity, and as
lie wanders amid the secluded shades
of Annacoco, admiring countrymen
will point him out as the man of ge
nuis-who could get elected with two
votes in a poll of seven hundred.

It wonld be a melancholy sight to
see any Southern Democrat returning
to his cqustitnency after having "sold

we speak when we say that he had
best consult some leading undertaker
before he undertakes to return-for
his constituency will have applied to
the rope dealer in order to deal with
him.

It is reported that Jas. Casey,
brother-in-law to President Grant, is
an open and avowed Nicholls' nman.
.Jas. Longstreet declares emphatical
ly that Nicholls was wa hnestly elected
and should be sustained as (Governor
by all honlest people. \Varmolh and
George Sheridan are also said to be
in full sympathy with the people's
movement.
Congressional Conimmitte(s still con
tinue investigations atid the action of
the Returning Board has not been
sustained by the evidence so far
elicited.
The Caddo Police Jury, Republican,
hit Packard thusly :
lie it Resolved by the Police Jury
of Caddo parish, in legal assembly
convened, That, as regards the poli
tical complicatioins in this State, we
solemuly believe the Nicholls govern
ment to be the only true and legal
government in the State of Louisiana ;
that we cheerfully aigree to obey said
government, and that so far as the

New Orleans, Jan. 15.--Packard
Issued a blustering proclamation, pre
dicated on an order from Grant, but
he saw it would not work and sub
sided. Our people in the city are
quiet and determined and nothing
shall deprive them of their rights.
New Orleans, Jan. 15-General
Augur has an order from Grant which
virtually recognizes Packard. On the
strength of it Packard at 3 o'clock a.
m. issued a proclamation demanding
the surrender of all courts, offices and
police stations and commanding our
Legislature to disperse. We have
5000 men ready to defend our rights
and will hold all we have. If Pack
ard wants the courts, etc., he must
take them by force. Nicholls will is
sue a counter proclamation at once.
Packard's police will leave the State
House at noon, and if they try to
take the Supreme Court there will be
plenty of funerals to morrow.
The fol!owing press dispatch dated
Saturday was received yesterday :
New Orleans, Jan. 13.-The Re
publican publishing Company served
a notice on Gov. Packard that pub
lication of the paper would be sus
pended after Sunday. Pinchback has
abandoned the Packard Legislature
carrying four Senators, three of whom
were sworn into the Nicholls Senate,
the fourth admitted his defeat at tlie
polls, but was counted in by the Re
turning Board. Six sergeants-at-arms
of Repubican Senate were arrested
to the parish pr ison in default of $1000
bail.
Marshal Pitkin left yesterday and
Collector Casey to-day fir Washing
ton.
Gen. Auglr says he won't assist
Packard and that he will interfere
only to preserve the peace. At 2:30(1
p. m. Packard had made no demon
srations but hie is trying to get negroes
to join hiis militia. We have enough
force to repulse them anywhere they
attempt an attack.
New OrleansJan. 15,3:10 p. m.
The Times has the following from
Washington : "Secretary Chandler
is in a bad box. Telegrams which
may change the issue in three States
are in the hands of the committee
with Chandler's signature to them.
He tried to evade answering whe!lther
hie had not hieen ordered to do what
was advised in his telegrams by the
President. He asked for timne and
the committee decided hie must an
Sswer all questions and that Grant's
recommendations are not privileged.
IThis is the sensation of the session.
The Republicans are very angry and
threaten to retaliate. A score of dis
patches from Louisiana Republicans
Sare in Democratic hands. One from
a very high official tells Chandler that
Louisianiis will be all right and says
the Democrats have about 8001) major
ity and that it will take big money to
fix thi gs.
"The administration is still firm in
the intention not to interfere. The
President told a Senator last evening
that he would absolutely do nothing
until Casey arrives."
NO FIGIHTERS.
New Orleans, Jan. 15, 6:30 p. in.
General Augur refused to interfere
without specific instructions from the
President.
Packard's proclamation fell still
born. After his night and morning
effort he could get but twenty-five
men willing to light, while the city
swarmed with armed citizens.ready
to protect the courts and stations.
Packard's whole force of one thou
sand could not have held ground
against the citizens ten minutes.
We have no later news from Wash.
ington. The government is so thor
oughly established now that Grant
will have to let it stand or literally
tear it up by the roots. If it had not
been for Grant's dispatch Packard's
Legislature would have disentegrated
to-day. HEARSEY.

ITinimportant matters are uindelr dis
cussion in Congress. The Senate is
debating the lquestion of the power
of the Vice-l'resident to count the
votes for President and declare the
result. The most bitter radicals as
sume extreme grounds and jilsist on
making the President of the Senate
the National Returning Board.
The future presents a glooniy out
look for the cause of popluhr govern
ment andl unless the Democrats enter
fully into the contest with the deter
ruination to install tile rigttful Pres
ident or fight, the end will come.
A special to the New Orleans cem,
ocrat, says :
"There is a rumor in Democratic
circles here this morning to the effect
that Fernando Wood and Ben Hill
had a quarrel Saturday, in the course
of whiicli 1133 Srlrn'.,, iUiUmatcjdLhis
belief that lHayes would he inugif:
rated and that a large majority of the
Southern people wouldl not be dis
pleased thereat.
I cannot as yet find coufirmation of
this rumor, but a leading Northern
Democrat, whose opinion is always
v;โข:htible, told tme not ten minutes
ago that lie had no doubt Hill med
itated desertlon, and was this moment
in correspondel.ce with the enemy.
These are the gentleman's exact
words, and lie is not a man who talks
at random." BuELL.
The following explains itself:
"The most careful observ'erS in and
out of Congress are of the opinion
that the original conspiracy of Clhtn
dler, Cameron and Gould, for the
Senate to declare Hayes President
and then to inaugurate him by the
army, remains unchanged. They
think it has been modified only in do
tails, and not in essentials. A Re
publican member of the House, from
whom moderation would be expected,
stated last night to your correspon
dent that it was the understanding
among the Republicans in Congress
that if the two houses could not agree,
then the President of the Senate
would count and declare the electo
ral vote. Their policy is then to use
the army in Hayes' favor to give pos
session of the executive departments.
The best opinion here is that the peo
ple may as well understand at once
what is before them, and make up
their minds whether the will submit
or resist."
The two sister commnittees of the
LIT U I t -.trev. ..* ... .- - 1 - t fai
consultation. The meeting will be
some what of the nature of a joint
commiittee, with a Senntor piesiding.
The committee on the privilegs,
rights and lduties of the House, r,
port, in addition to other points, tlhat
no vote shall be counted against the
judgement of the House. The re
port was adopted by a strict party

Let tile Democratic House stand
firm. Nobody is frightened save the
trimmers. Stand by the constitution
and let the radicals dare force Hayes
ulfill us.

ducing the great staples of the world,
viz: cotton, sngar, tobacco, and all
the small grains. Nowhere on the
continent does fruit come to such per
fection; oranges, apples, peaches,
pears and grapes, together with all
the smaller varieties, ai produced in
abundance. Our climate is healthy
and salubrious; our seasons are mild
and even. Nature has been kind to
us in all ways, and all that remains
now to be done, that our land may
prosper, is' that Capital and Labor
may lie induced to come among us.
The first will find a rich field to re
ward it, and the latter will be hearti
ly welcomed.
We conclude that all will see the
great advantage of advertising, in
order to lay before the people of the
bleak North, and the-barren Atlantic
board, tile elysium that awaits the
hardy, industrious immigrant, in
Louisiana.
Let land owners show faith Sy
works and give us a trial.
