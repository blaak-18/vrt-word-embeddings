takes entirely the occasion for cono

is necessary. no rare oeaqions is it
required to effect comptomlies with
an enemy -which are rather excep

political opponents follow-to yield
nothing to enemies, everything to
friends; in other words to practice
the trite saying "to the victors belong
the spode.".'

only to cite the Magna Cpharta of

A DISPATCH FROM DR. DALZEI.I.,
Memphis, July 12.-One death occurred
here on the 9th nist., which was a clear
sporadic case of yellow fever; but that
has been the ouly well marked case.
Thole has been one other" death from
fever of donbtfnl character. No new

IN A IEF.ALTIIY COIDITION.
New Orleans, July 12.-The auliaryl
sanitary assoeition niakee the followiun
statement in bacial form: "After thor
ough investigation by th9 ollers and
members of this association, supported
by the testimony of the board of health
and the New Orleans health asoeation,
we hereby declare that the city is now
in a perfeetly healthby condition, and that
there has naot been a single ese of yel.
low fever in the city during the present
summer, and that the city is in a better
eanltary condition than for many years,
and the absence of levers, which usually
precede yellow fever, inspires the belief
that we shall ielcipe any serious siekness.
The country will be dileially nodtied

THE ELECTRIC LIUGHT.
Experimental Trial to be Mide Ia the
Hall of the Honse.
(Wa;hington Post.)
"l'TliR is the dynamn-e.lectric mee!
chine," said Professor J. II. Rogers to,
the Post yestedl:1y, as it Ieall to
explain the, nintlner in whiich the iap
itol is anon to le illutlinated with
the electric ligh!.
The replorter was glad to know it.
It looked something like the half of a
lour barrel. But how did it work ?
''I u ill show you," sai'! the pro
fessor, and so, both metaphorietlly
and liteirally, lie relieved the dense
ignorancei of the quill diivel h1% tluri.
ilng on the enitrelnt and ignitiiug the
ca bon points. 'The altlil:itus wis
downll in the rooltl where are pHi'ed
the boilers that supply the enlgines
underneath the house, and the bril
liant glare of the light contrasted
strongly with the usual gloom of the
subterranean chanmber. The ma
chine is of the kind made by Arnoiux
& Ilochhausen, of New York, and, as
explained by the professor, consists of
many helices connected together by
soft iron bars worked around a imag
netic center so as to have a cylindri
cal shape. The revolution of these
helices produces a continued streanm
of electricity, which is conducted by
means of copper wires to the lamp
situated about sixty feet distant,
through the low dark corridor. This
dynamo-electric machine is set in
motion by beitng connected with one
of the engines anid is capable of mak
ing 700 revolutions to the minute,
and of producing a light equal in
brilliancy to from sixteen to twenty
thousand sperm candles. The lanimp
was next visited, and the leporter
saw a procelain globe resting on small
bars of copper, fastened to a metal
ting that encircled the globe. There
were four narrow cylinders which
contained the carlton pencils, and
they projected from beyond the edge
of the tiug and converged till they
met equidistant from the center of
the globe. This obviates one of the
objectionable features of other elec
tric lamps, which is that the carbon
points do not always remain equidis
tant from each other, andconsequent.
ly there appears a stalagmite on the
negative pole, which obstructs the
brilliancy of the light. There is also
another irregularity that is prevented
by using four carbon points. When
only two points are used the positive
pole becomes concave, causing the
light to burn as in a crater; but by
using the four points the carbon in
each cylinder is let down equally and
simultaneously by a small weight
running over several pulleys, con
necting with the carbon. It is con
sunted on all sides in the same quan
tity, thereby doing away with all ir
regularity The Focault burner, tlle
one heretofore used, was regulated by
clock;-'ork, which could not be de
pended upon, and hence the light
flickered and became paiutful to the
eyes. But Mr. Rogers' light is soft,
brilliant, agreeable sanll steady, mak
ing no glare, and burning perfectly.
The price of one of Focaults lamps
is $140, while Mr. Bogers' invention
costs only $15. The expense of
lightin up the hoease alone, where
there are ,10). gas jett, is $@ per
hour, while the electric lamp can
produce a melb better light for fifty
cents an hour. Mr. Clark, thIe archbi..
Stect of the capitol, intends to place
four of these lamls above the glass
ceiling of the house, and has white
washed the real ceiling labove tie
baill, so as both to refleot and retract
the light. The engine which will run
the dynamo-electric machine is in
process of construction, and the hlons
of representatives will soon be light'
ed up with an electric blaze that will
necessitate exceeding caution by eve
ry muember of congress during the
night sessions.

fever. I)r. Sima is the physaician who
in 1872, discovered the first case of
yellow fever, and whose opinion was
hiltterly contradicted by the entire
lmedicall fratternaitV of the city until
thet disease becallle epidemic. Dr.
Sim's opinion of the case to-day is
bIornle olt liy the fact that thie womlan
who nilrsled the Iman until lhe died
this mnlorniniig, is sick in bed wit~h
what, l)r. Satulldels, hern physician,
physician, pIlonounces intermittent
fever.
The opinion has prevailed among
the lmedical element here that a few
sporadic cases of yellow fever would
occur here this year, and the condi
tion of several localities where there
was s,ch a terrible fatality and in
conceivalle destitution in 1878 would
produce these cases. The now gov
ernment of the city has been labor
ing with whatever means they could
command and authority vested in
them by the legislature to prevent a
reoccurence of thel, disease, and to
day our streets, alleys and suburbs
MuIlbrandon died to-day is on the
corner of DeSoto and Paontotoc streets,
in which, it is rumored a number of
negroes took refuge and one died of
yellow fever last year.
The excitement of to.day has re
solved itself into a general discussion
of the matter and no doubt the coun
try round about will be spread with
wild rumors about the sanitary con
dition of Memphis. Physicians have
declared their opinion that there is no
probability of ain epidemic.
