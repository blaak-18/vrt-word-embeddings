ORN SPEAKS ON
SHERBORN STREET
—K-K-K > \
EDITOR OF KLAN PAPER WELL
RECEIVED IN SOUTHERN
MINNESOTA VILLAGE.
—K-K-K
Sherburn, Minn.—“ Twilight" Orn,
editor of the Call cf the North, spoke
here recently. He was well received,
and enthusiastically cheered at fre
quent intervals throughout his fiery,
scholarly, interesting lecture the
Ku Klux Klan. A* a newspaper man,
Mr. Orn is some orator and through
out his 1* „ur< truths with
sledge Vammer Jwcws int-o th* minds
or his »< lienor. People speak of the
leather-lunged Magnus Johnson, but
let all learn here and now that the
editor of the Call of the North need
not give second place to anyone when
it comes to voice power. Mr. Orn’s
voice had the clearness and carrying
power of a clarion. People that stood
three blocks away could hear the Klan
lecturer distinctly. Upon what kind
of meat do these Minnesota Skandi
navians feed that they “grow" such
powerful voices?
Mr. Orn said many things that the
writer has wanted to say for a long
time. He gave some of the young
men in his audience many things to
think about most seriously when he
said, “Young men, possibly some of
you think it is smart and up-to-date
to take advantage of the girls with
whom you associate. You throw the
moral code, common decency, every
spark of real manliness, all chivalry
and honor into the ash can, then go
forth to prey on the chastity of the
American girl. You think it is smart
to see how near the brink of hell you
can lure any and all girls that ac
cept your attentions. When your
girl companion protests your low
down, dirty advances and fights for
her womanly purity, you dub her as
“slow” and unsophisticated. A pole
cat is a refined gentleman compared
with such a man—no, no, not man,
but devil. There are too many irre
ligious libertines, hell hounds, moral
lepers, degenerate reprobates, human
skunks in America. The Klan be
lieves in the protection of pure wo
manhood and will fearlessly lay le
gal hands of certain punishment on
all that endanger the glorious, un
stained purity of the American wo
man. Listen to me, young man, you
would pound your best friend to pulp
if he did the things to your sister
that you do to girls that the unfor
tunate enough to entrust themselves
with you outside of the passing pub
lic view, yet you forget all the while
that the girl you prey upon for the
satisfaction of your animal passion
is somebody’s sister. O men, men,
take violent hold of yourself and pray
God that He will give you a true con
ception of the need and glory of pure
womanhood and clean manhood. The
philosophy that contends that men
and women must sow wild oats be
fore ready to settle down to Christ
ian living was born in the slime of
perdition’s most rotton slough.’*
We earnestly hope that Mr. Orn
will come back to our village soon;
we are certain that Orn’s coming was
a very good thing for our commu
nity.
OUR HATCHET
The Ku Klux Klan is Kluxing,
I guess you’ve heard us kackle.
We’ve got our little hatchet out;
We'll soon begin to hackle.
We’ve got a brand new hatchet, too;
Pop says “It must be bright,
Because some things must be stopped
That goes on in the night.”
In this here town, the way things are,
We think they’re pretty bad.
But Pop knows how to maxe 'em right
For clean-up he’s the lad.
We got some enemies, it's true,
And we know who they be.
By Gosh! we got it on ’em,
They don’t know who they see.
That’s why we keep so secret
About our names and such;
When they know not who we are,
They cannot hurt us much.
So now you cops get busy
And each bring in a still.
Pep says, “By golly, if yen d«a*t,
The gang and him sure win.”

FIERY CROSS INDICATED NIGHT
MEETING OF KU KLUX
KLAN.
—K-K-K
Several automobile parties ap
proaching Pigeon Hill last night on
the Lake Crystal road were alarmed
to see the sky illuminated in the vi
cinity of the hill between eleven and
twelve o’clooV by * fitry cross. Tp”

Presumably the Ku Klux Klan* held
another meeting last night. It is re
ported that the Klan nse the fiery
cross symbol when the required num
ber of members are initiated into
the Order. Efforts to learn some
thing definite about the meeting to
day failed as none of the automo
bile parties ventured close to the
meeting.
This morning the pole of the cross
was standing in the pasture field
where the meeting was held. The
cross arm of the cross handled with
gunny sack, lay at the foot of the
'•ross in charred bits. A few cows
'razed about the cross when in
spected today.
Several Mankato golfers return
ing from Fairmount saw the burning
cross about midnight. They said
that a number of automobiles were
parked near the scene but no white
robed figures of the Klansmen could
be seen at a late hour.
Earlier in the evening auto par
ties claim that they saw a large
"rowd standing in the light of the
blaze from the cross. One man esti
mated the number at 200.—Mankato

RED WING MAKES
ANOTHER BOAST
Red Wing Klansmen make the
boast that they are the only Klan
in the state that has three genera
tions of Klansmen in the same fam
ily—all active workers. The grand
father, son and grandson in one of
Red Wing’s prominent families en
joy this distinction and challenge
any one to show an equal record in
Minnesota.
AMERICAN HOSPITAL
OPENS IN SEPTEMBER
KLANSMEN UNITE FOR A NOBLE
PURPOSE.
—K-K-K
The first unit of the American Hos
pital, which, when completed, will
have cost $1,000,000, will be opened
at Topeka, Kansas, under control and
management of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan, early in September.
Last May the Toepka Klan met and
determined to establish a Protestant
hospital at Topeka. At a closed
meeting held by Klansmen in the
city auditorium, the sum of $50,000
was raised for the hospital project
within an hour. Of this amount, the
sum of $25,000 has been paid to
wards the purchase of a splendid
dwelling located in eight acres of
wooded land, directly opposite Gage
Park in Topeka. This house will he
transformed into a temporary Amer
ican Hospital with accommodations
for thirty patients.
The board of trustees, all prom
inent Topeka business men, has ob
tained the services of Professor Al
bert Haberstro, formerly of Wash
burn University, who has taken over
the executive management of the
project.
A four days’ drive for stock sub
scriptions wil be staged in Topeka,
within the next week or so. This
will be followed by a further cam
paign throughout Shawnee County.
Then a campaign for funds wiQ be
conducted through the fifteen other
counties in Northeastern Kansas,
which will support the project
through their Klan organisations.
The financial objective of a million
dollars, which will erect one of the
most modern and beautiful hospitals
in the United States, will be attained
in about one year.

—K-K-K
Dayton, O.—A gigantic parade,
given exclusively by women of
the Ku Klux Klan, caused a sensa
tion here last week when thousands
of women in full regalia marched
eight abreast, led by the Dayton
Klan band, which played “Onward
Christian Soldiers,” during the time
of march.
Thousands of red torches along the
line added to the picturesqueness of
the marching women who were gath
ered ta take part in initiation cere
monies of a class of 2,000 candidates.
While the candidates were having
the oath administered to them two
huge fiery crosses burst into flame
and the strains of “Nearer, My God,
to Thee,” floated softly across the
grounds. Following this, the Day
ton Klan Glee club sang “The Old
Rugged Ctoss.’
Flag Is Presented
A well-known Methodist minister
l hen gave an address on American
ism and an American flag was pre
sented the ladies by a Presbyterian
preacher. Both men are very prom
inent in Dayton.
About 6,000 Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan witnessed the ceremonies
of the women, and a special -Klan
mounted guard was commended for
the fine system in which it handled
the big crowd.

—K-K-K
New York, Aug. 22.—Show girls,
nude to the waist, have appeared on
Broadway.
Posed frankly in the glare of full
lighting in a review which has just
opened here, they constitute New
York’s most daring emulation of the
Folies Bergere of Paris.
Even the blase Broadway audi
ence appeared stunned when the cur
tain rolled up at the New Shubert
Revue of “Artists and Models.”
There Was silence for a moment,
then scattered handclapping, loud
laughter from the gallery and a few
groans and hisses.

The girls are the central figures
of “still”- pictures. While the “pic

At the second night extra seats

—K-K-K
St. Paul, Minn.—Quite a large
number of St. Paul Protestant women
assembled Wednesday evening and
, ist ned to a very interesting lecture
>n “The Mighty Challenge,** by a well
mown l v .rt4L*-aat St. Paul minister.
he Qu-ceit Kleagle for the state of
Minnesota presided at this meeting
and was more than pleased with the
'esopnse of the women on hearing
■-.he challenge for greater activity in
L he affairs of the nation. It was very
Peering to note the unusual interest
vhich the women of Minnesota are
receiving the gospel of Klankraft.
No Klansman need feel that his sex
is fighting the battle for a better
\merica alone. The women are alert
and earnestly seeking ways and
-Deans whereby they can be the most
effective
The Queen Kleagle can be reached
at any time by writing to Postoffice
Box 172, St. Paul, Minnesota. All
women interested in the great Pro
testant women's organization known
as the Women of the Klan
should get in touch with the head of
f he Minnesota organization as soon
as possible.
SPECIAL DISPATCH—A Protes
tant woman of St. Paul attended the
above reported meeting and has of
fered to donate a sum of five hun-
Ired dollars toward club rooms for
L he Women of the Ku Klux Klan.

VALPARAISO “0”
PURCHASED BY KLAN
'500,000 to Be Spent on Improve-
Indianapolis, Ind. Negotiations
have been completed for the taking
•'ver of Valparaiso university, locat
ed at Valparaiso, Indiana, by the Ku
Klux Klan organization. The uni
versity, which is one of the oldest
educational institutions in the coun
try, will with the change of owner
ship and management be given an
other name. From reports current
the new name will be “National Uni
versity.”
The purchase price was announced
at $350,000, which represents an
amount about equal to the total in
debtedness of the institution. Five
hundred thousand dollars will be
spent immediately for improvements
of the university buildings and in ad
dition an endowment of another half
million dollars will be established.
Announcement of the taking over
of the university, which was recently
reported to be on the verge of finan
cial collapse, came after a series of
conferences with Klan officials, which
lasted more than two weeks. The
nresent trustees of the university
will submit their resignations im
mediately, and five new trustees
from the Indiana realm of the Klan
will selected to take their places.
These five will constitute a quonim
until other realms of the Klan
throughout the country can be called
on for representatives among the di
rectors of the institution.
The “Klan University” will be
strictly non-sectarian and operated
on a sound American basis. Valpa
raiso university has long been known
as the “poor man’s Harvard.”
“Cuss words” seldom heard in po
lite society are bandied about with
"heery nonchalance.
A burlesque on “Rain,” current
dramatic sketch, is used as a peg
upon which to hang more smoky
’anguage than Broadway ever heard
over the footlights before.

There is considerable speculation
just now as to the merits of the Ku
Klux Klan.
The generally accepted idea ap
pears to obtain that the Klan is a
'awless organization which goes
about performing acts of skulldug
gery of one kind or another.
This paper has not voiced its opin
ion in the premises for that very
reason, i. e., that we hardly knew
what to make of it—whether the
thing was good, bad, indifferent or
something else.
But from authoritative informa
tion this paper is convinced that the
Ku Klux Klan is just the sort of an
organization we need today to deal
with lawless people and “privileged”
characters. The latter is a type of
citizen in most communities who for
some peculiar, inexplainable reason
are always passed up by the author-,
ities of these various communities.
About the only way to handle these
“privileged” and lawless elements is
for God-respecting, God-fearing and
law-abiding citizens to organize to
protect decent society from their ne
farious and devilish influences.
The very fact that wife-beaters,
bootleggers, lawbreakers and every
lawless element who treat good gov
ernment as a joke are doing every
thing to prejudice people against the
Klan is just why every law-abiding
citizen should be for it. "
All the rot and deliberate lying
that has been put forth concerning
the Klan has invariably come from
this class of people and unfortunate
ly, has been aided by many good peo
ple who have been misinformed in the
premises.
The burning cross is the symbol of
the Klan and it is a warning sign to
all who violate the law.
What especially appeals to ns
about the Ku Klux Klan is that it
stands four-square on the Bible and
the divinity of Christ. Because of
accepting Christ no Jews are admit
ted to membership, for the Jew de
nies that Christ is the Son of God.
Another thing about the Klan that
appears to us is that it is one hun
dred per cent American.
A lot of dirty work has been done
and then blamed to the Klan in ef
forts to discount its aims and pur
poses, but in every instance it was
found to be the tactics pursued by its
enemies to deceive the people.
Knowing the Klan to be an organ
ization of sane, sober and God-re
specting people whose main purpose
is to stamp out lawlessness Mnd in
decencies and thus make our Ameri
can communities better communities,
this paper is for it.
This is a one hundred per cent
American newspaper and as such it
stands for a true and nobler Ameri
can citizenship. Sherburn Advance-

LAWLESS ELEMENT STRIKE AT

UNDOING.
—K-K-K
Stubenville, Ohio.—The hand of
foreignlsm showed its utter disregard
of law and fair play when a gang
of would-be assassins shot a well
known Steubenville Klansman on his
way home, and attacked Klansmen
leaving their meeting place here
Thursday, August 16.
Darwin L. Gibson was on his way
home, driving down a dark street,
when he was fired upon by several
men skulking in the darkness. Mr.
Gibson and his companion returned
the shots wounding at least two of
the gunmen. Mr. Gibson, however,
was seriously wounded in the ex
change of shots and had to be taken
to a local hospital where it was found
that a bullet had entered his head and
it is possible that the wound may
prove fatal, although the last dis
patch to the Call of the North reports
him improving.
Dominic Spinitti and John DiSentis
themselves badly wounded, are under
guard in a local hospital, and Frank
Velta is in the county jail, charged
with the shooting of Klansman Gib
son. Spinitti is shot in the shoulder
and DiSentis is shot through the left
eye. The names of these men do not
leave anyone in doubt as to what
part of Europe they or their parents
came from. We can very nearly pos
itively state that they art not Pro
testants, but bitter haters of people
that do not accept their church.
The Fight Began
The fight began when the Klan
meeting broke up at 10:45 Thursday
night. As the visiting Klansmen filed
from the hall to enter their automo
biles, a spokesman of the mob hailed
the first man to enter his car, shoot
ing something about the American
flag, objecting, it seems, to Klansmen
using the flag on their autos.
Hot words were were rapidly pass
ed back and forth and then a fist
fight began in which the Klansmen
made every effort to defend them
selves against the gang of lawless
ness. Twelve Klansmen seated in
the three leading automobiles suf
fered injuries inflicted by fists, sticks
and stones. Their cars were wrecked.
Police and deputy sheriffs, after more
than three-quarters of an hour of
work quelled the foreign-minded mob
of attackers. About forty of the mob
were injured in the battle. It is es
timated that a thousand men, haters
of the Klan and thus revealed as en
emies of America, were in the at
tacking mob.
On the day following the attack
more than one thousand Klansmen
assembled at Richmond, twelve miles
west of Steubenville and went over
the details of the mob attack on the
night before. In a statement one
Steubenville Klansman demanded the
resignation of Mayor Hawkin' and
Chief of Police Carter, declaring the
August 16th disorder was the result
of lax law enforcement. The Klar
has been very active around here ir
getting the law violators, especially
the bootleggers and moonshiners dur
the recent months and no doubt
aroused the ire of a number who
didn’t want laws enforced.

“ELAN IS MY FRIEND IF I LIVE

—K-K-K
Pratt, Kan.—Four hundred candi
dates were naturalized in the initia
tion ceremonies of the Ku Klux Klan
on a farm owned by a negro about
two miles from town a few evenings
ago.
A series of addresses on Klandom
and Americanism was received with
much enthusiasm by the crowd which
numbered from four to five thousand.
Three fiery crosses were burned dur
ing the evening, one at the inita
tion ceremony and two while the
speaking was going on.
The fact that a negro owned the
farm on which the ceremonies were
conducted was the cause of much
comment and when asked why he
turned it over to the Klan for the
evening he said: "Because they are
Americans, and I am not afraid of
them because I knew they are true,
whether white or Mack.”

MANY MEN OF THE SAINTLY

BOUNDS OF INVISIBLE
EMPIRE.
—K-K-K
St. Paul, Minn.—The largest class
of candidates that the local Klan has
naturalized was introduced to the
mysteries of the Invisible Empire last
Monday evening.
Cloudy skies threating rain did not
daunt the spirit of several hundred
Klansmen who followed the “invisi
ble” trail to the out-door Klavern
of the Ramsey County Klan. Lights
from the cars wending their way
through the field caused the distant
trees to cast continuously changing
spectral shadows, giving the Klavern
a wierd atmosphere—an ideal setting
for a Klan meeting, you will admit.
Just as the candidates were begin
ning to adjust themselves to the
ghostly Klavern a voice burst forth
eulogizing the real Klansmen. The
noviates looked in all directions but
“saw” not the voice. The Night
Hawk insists that some of the “so
journers” seeking more light in Klan
craft couldn’t keep their jaws still or
nrevent their knees from bending.
We don’t believe him, even tho he is
a man of veracity on most occasions.
The “unseen” voice ceased the eu
'ogy and was heard no more. The
ntual progressed beautifully making
a permanent impression on the minds
if all the noviates.
The most impressive part of the
evening, all agree, arrived when the
'andidates kneeled in solemn prayer
before the altar beneath the flickering
ight of the burning cross. After the
“amen” of the prayer was given in
mison the strains of “Nearer My
jod to Thee” came from the lips of
Clansmen chanting that beautiful
hymn.
The speaker of the evening pre
sented a message that gave to all in
the, Klavern assembled a very com
ilpete insight into Klankraft and
ind Klandom. He, in his official and
irivate capacities, pledged everything
: n his power for the glorification of
\merica and the Ku Klux Klan. His
jpords had a ring of sincerity that
-eached every man within the hear
ng of his voice. The speaker also
'xtolled the objectives of all true
Klansmen and the Klan so forcibly
is to rekindle all embers of construc
tive interest. When the speaker closed
in applause of healthful enthusiasm
broke forth, giving evidence that
Treater things could be expected from
hat moment on.
Every Klansman of St. Paul who
attended last Monday’s meeting looks
forward to the next time when he
•an again emigrate to the delectable
bounds of the Invisible Empire.

POPLAR BLUFF KLAN
DEDICATES KLAVERN
Elansmen of Southern Missouri
and Northern Arkansas, gathered
at Poplar Bluff, Mo., some days ago
and formally dedicated the new
Klavern building of Poplar Bluff Klan
Number 48, Realm of Missouri.
The Klavern is an artistic and un

'pot specially selected and purchased
by the Klan a few miles from Poplar
Bluff. It is surrounded by grassy
slopes which form a natural amphi
theatre, capable of seating several
thousand people. The dedication
ceremonial was featured by the nat
