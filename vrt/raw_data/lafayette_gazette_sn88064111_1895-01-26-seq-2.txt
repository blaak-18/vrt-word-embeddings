made by the manager of the Mex- ti

The esteemed True Democrat of
Bayou Sara, concurs in the opinion
recently expressed by the Advocate b
that the boycott instituted against f
Col. Breckinridge by the ladies in b
several of the cities he has visited is i'
unjustifiable. Our Bayou Sara t
contemporary takes no stock how- I
ever in the gay Colonel's professions t
of penitence and suggests that the r
ladies might quietly stay away from t
his lectures and allow those to attend (
who may desire to do so.-Baton t
Rouge Advocate. C
The True Democrat is right; all
Sthis hubbub raised by the ladies C
serves as a splendid advertisement e
for Col. ]3reckinridge. If thoset
good ladies do not wish to listen to
the gray-haired sinner let them keep I
away and no one will say nay, but h
to persist in keeping alive this Pol
lard-Breckinridge scandal will dot
no good. If the society women
will "let up" for a while Billy
Breck will son sink out of view.

LETS HAVE- ONVE.
New Iberia, Lake Charles, .St.'
ita'rtinville and a number of other
Louisiana towns have well-organ- an
ined boards of trade, but we are Le
sorry to say that Lafayette is be- mi
bind her sisters in this respect. And Be
why haven't we -one? Certainly tip
not because our town is -not large fal
enough to support it, but simply jo:
because our business men seem to w)
lak 'that spirit of unity so necessary tbi
to the prosperity of all communi- fri
ties. Towns less pretentious than hi!
ours have boards of trade, and we bl;
regret to say that here not even lo'
an effort has been mnale to organ- Be
ize one. All those acquainted Be
with the rapid and substantial ev
growth of towns know how much stt
good is to be derived from an or- an
ganization of this" kind. It would da
be the means of bringing to our an
section men of wealth who would se
help to develop our manifold re- le;
sources. It would dissiminate to
throughout the .Northern States as
valuable imnformation concerning th
our soil, climate, crops, and people, p<
and it would also'.fall within its C:
province to reply to the numerous
inquiries from "prospective settlers s51
which now remain unanswered. qi
At the present time there are in ca
the New England States a number hm
of cotton mills which will be moved ut
to the Southern States in the near
future. Perhaps with reasonable
inducements the proprietors of one
of these plants could be persuaded it
to select a site in our parish. Our th
natural advantages for the manu- w
facture of cotton goods are un- er
equaled anywhere, and with a lit- at
tle exertion by our people, they at
r would doubtless receive the proper PI
- recognition at the hands of manu- s
facturers.' cs
Our good neighbors in Breaux
Bridge are clamoring for a railroad ic
to this town, and so far they have di
received but little encouragement hi
s from the people here. This seem
f ing indifference is due to a lack of
3 unity and organization which would al
t not exist with a board of trade. ti
t The urgent need of an organiza
- tion of this sort to represent the
3 town in all matters wherein the s
- welfare of the whole community is tl
,t involved, is apparent to all thought- b
ful men, and it is indeed urfortu
tunate that our more public-spirited
e citizens do not take the matter in
hand at once. Other societies
e flourish in Lafayette and there is no
reason why a board of trade should
n not meet with the-same success.

fMORE ABOUT THE RE
FINE R Y. t
The cane planters in the neigh- r
P borhood of Carencro were more
fortunate this year - than their
n brothers in other parts of the par- r
isish. With very .few exceptions
.a they sold the whole of their crop.
v It is true the price obtained by t
i them was rather low, but no cane
e as left to rot in the fields as was
i the case in other sections. The
d Carencro mill and Huron refinery ,
in being operated within short distances a
of their fields the Carencro planters
ll had a safe home-market for their
es crop, otherwise they would have
nt enctountered the same diffiiculties
se that planters in this and other sec
to tions had to contend with. We
mention this to prove the 'correct
ut ness of our statement last week that
º1- if the farmers near Lafayette want
o to continue the cultivation of cane
n a central refinery is absolutely ne
ly cessary. Without one it will be
decidedly risky for a farmer to en
gage in the cultivation of cane, as
'e past experiences teaches him that
- he can not, with safety, depend up
. on any of the refineries in the ad
m joining parishes to *'puchase his
t- cane. The Gazette may lay itself
e liable to the charge of being mono
m tonous or cranky, but it is deter
ul mined to talk about the refinery un
h til the people make an earnest effort
at to build one. If, after this is done,
s- it happens that we have spoken in
e vain, we promise our readers that
Ip- they will enjoy a long and .much
of needed rest on this subject.
e- The Gazette has received a let
-ter from a gentleman in a dis
- tant State asking what is the feel
Sing of the people here regarding the
in-sugar bounty. We replied that the
on people of this section believed that
they had been deceived and greatly
so wronged by the government; that
rs the bounty should have been paid
d on this year's crop at least; and
the that this unjust policy of the gov
a ernmenthad caused ruin to many
ed planters, and that Congress was
gh guilty of having committed a shame
s ful wrong against a large part of the
Spopulation of Louisiana.

*The Daily Crusader, the leading to
and ablest Republican paper in trac
Louisiana, does not seem to take tbhr
much stock in the tears Judge dali
Beattie is shedding for the outraged dis4
rights of the colored brother. The any
fact is the Lafourche gentleman en- par
joys the reputation of being some- Sot
what of a bull-dozer himself, and for
though now he poses as the negro's Spc
friend, the Crusader will not accept of 1
his professions of friendship for the of
black voter as sincere. We give be- Sot
low what the Crusader says of Judge nat
Beattie's sudden change of heart. gre
Before condemning the Judge, how- the
ever, we should consider the circum- ant
stances attending his nomination rat
and those that surround his case to- cot
day. Then, he was the nominee of roa
an aristocratic body of planters as- cla
sembled at a high-toned New Or- the
leans hotel. No.v, he is preparing Co
to go before the American Cogress tor
as the defender of civil liberty(!) and co!
the champion of the rights of the bo:
poor negro in Louisiana. Says the bei
Crusader: for
Beattie, besides, has learned much inf
since the election. He has become ma
quite a good Republican. His wil
utterances towards the close of the
campaign, and after the election, he
have been vastly different from his leg
utterances when freshly nominated for

enjoyment of life, rights, property
and in the pursuit of happiness; It
and, with this end in view, he has tiv
put himself in print as in favor of a op
Federal election law in order to to
secure honest election and fair fal
counts.
He may have come to this opin- as
I ion by force, he may have been on
driven to it by the unfair treatment go

cratic friends, but it is not our busi- el

n TIIE LO UISIA A RICE la
NV . LU T'R- Y.
New Orlcrns Pic.yune.
d Although the exact size of the in
last rice crop is not yet determined, f'
it is apparent that it was a very s';
short one. Nevertheless, ooving to so
the satisfactory prices which have tc
prevailed, the producer- have ni:Lde L
p some money, and, as a result, the I
ir rice industry is in a far inore pro
perous condition than any of the
i other agricultural interests. i
As a result of this prosperity, :
y there will be a strong tea;ptation to c
e greatly increase the acreage during
s the comir.g season, and, as the ',
ie other industries are now less profit- -
Y able, the increase in the rice
act rage will probaly be a wise
move. The depression in sugar A
ir will no doubt induce many sugar
e growers to turn their attention to
s rice, with the result that much of u
- the river country which has recently
re neglected rice for sugar will return
to the cultivation of the former
at article, as requiring less outlay and
at promising in the present condition
e of things a more certain return than
sugar.
e If the acreage is to be increased,
"some attention must be given to the
s improvement of the seed. There
t has been much complaint during
' the past season as to deterioration
- in the quality of the rice marketed,
us whitch deterioration could not be
elf attributed to weather, or any known
cause, but inferior seed. During!
r- the coming season, therefore, strict
in- attention ought to be given to the
rt selection of better seed, even if it
e, should be necessary to import some

THE COTTOVN .MILL.
The. removal of the cotton mills, N<
to the Southern States is at- min
tracting a great deal of attention Lr
throughout the country. The large
dalies are giving more space to the
discussion of this subject than to
any other. Even the New England
papers painfully admit that the
South offers superior advantages
for the manufacture of cotton good s.
m
Speaking of this move the treasurer Boas
of the famous Amoskeag Company
of New Hampshire says: "This LA}
Southern movement is perfectly
natural. Labor at the South is a
great deal lower than in the North, VA)
the mills are newer the cotton fields,
and there is a grat saving in freight
rates. Again, Southern roads- take i7t'
cotton as fifth class, while Northern
roads take it as second- and third
class, making a big difference; then an
there is a great difference in fuel. Con
Coal in New England costs $4.50 a Laft
ton, while in the South it does not at ti
cost more than $1.50 per ton. La- fay'
bor, however; is the great saving, bets
because operatives work mote hours as f
for less wages, and it is claimed a say- trac
ing of two cents per pound can be al 1
made. I think that Southern mills tair.
will increase. We are hampered o,,
here by trades unions, strikes and Bre
legislation, making it more difficult sig
for us to manfacture at a profit.
There certainly is no prospects of
any new mills belgg built in LNew La
England, and old mills will have
great diffiiculty in living. Mills here
have got to reduce wages or shut up.
Fine goods can be made cheaper in
the South as well as coarse goods.
It is claimed that Southern opera
tive are not as sailled as Northern
operatives and that it takes too long
to educate them, but this is
false; Southern operatives are just
I as good in every respect, and it is
only a question of time when fine
t goods will be made in the South.
I abor is a much more important
Selement in making fine goods than -
coarse goods, and consequently the
t Southern mill has a greater advan
tage over us in making fine goods.
Perhaps the Miassachusetts Lecgisla
ture will appreciate this when it is
too late."
