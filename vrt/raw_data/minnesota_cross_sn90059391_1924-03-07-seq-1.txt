CHICAGO, March I. Governments
everywhere are standing at the cross
roads, and in America mutinous mi
norities are in revolt against repre
sentative government, against edu
cation, even against law. President
L. D. Coffman of the University of
Minnesota told members of the su
perindence section of the National
Education association, meeting here
today. He declared that everywhere
groups are attempting to decide
matters on the basis of prejudice
rather than in terms of knowledge
and fact.
“Government by partisanship in
the interest of special groups or
classes, rather than government by
principle, is the greatest weakness
in democracy,” he said, “one which
now is expressing itself in many
ways.
Party Discipline Gone
“Nationalism seems to be wanting.
Sectionalism is becoming more as
sertive. The old individual leader
ship has passed on. It was followed
by a multitude of leaders on whom
shifting groups bestowed a transient
allegiance. Now we seem to be in
the midst of an outburst of political
individualism. With the decapita
tion of the party leaders, party dis
cipline disappeared. Government,
instead of being in the hands of par
ty leaders who are sent as represent
atives with delegated authority, has
now fallen into the hands of an ar
ray of minor prophet* who work to
fulfill the demands and create the
panaceas of their political authori
ties and of their political support
ers.”
President Coffman said that the
revolt against competent leadership
is extending itself to include a re
volt in some quarters against learn

ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, MARCH 7, 1924
Minneapolis Jews Oppose Johnson' Bill; Cry
‘Persecution* When America Runs Own Affairs
MEETING IS HELD IN
CITY HALL ASSEMBLY
loin the Nation-Wide Movement
Asking That Flood-Dates
He Left Open
MINNEAPOLIS. MINN., March I.
In a meeting held here recently, the
various Jewish organizations of this
city went on record as opposed to the
proposed revision of the immigration
laws now before congress. We have
learned that this meeting was one of
many being held over the United
States by Jewish organizations. The
Minneapolis meeting was held in the
assembly room of the city hall.
It seems that the Jews have care
fully planned their opposition and
are attempting to coerce the mem
bers of congress sufficiently to pre
vent the passage of the Johnson Im
migration bill.
The Johnson bill proposes a change
in the immigration laws now in force
so as to effectively meet the needs
of the nation. The three per cent
now used in determining quotas is
too high, and the 1910 census which
at present stands as the “multipli
cand” makes it possible for too many
unassimilable people to enter our
country. The Johnson bill estab
lishes the “multiplier” at two per
cent and the census of 1890 as the
“multiplicand.” These changes would
exclude a large number of Jews. Ital
ians, S*nd other peoples that do not
assimilate readily.
The nation-wide anti-immigration
restriction activities of the Jewish
organizations of this country will be
watched, for they appear to be en
tirely out of line with the best,in
terests of the United States. For
<>nr national life we must prevent
this country from becoming the
dump-yard of the world; we have no
need for the polyglot riff-raff that
other nations wish to disgorge. Ev
ery American who truly loves the
United States should let his con
gressman know that he wants legis
lation which will stem tjie alien tide
of undesirables.
When Jewish leaders read this ar
ticle they will lift their voices and
shout “persecution.” It has come to
the point where when you speak in
behalf of your country, you are de
nounced as “intolerant.” If being
intolerant means that we stand for
our national welfare, thank God there
are so many intolerant people in the
United States as there are.

Much Horse-Play Marks
Session of * Dignified*
United States Senate
(Bureau •! Publication slid Kdliestlon)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 1
Yesterday the ugliest, nastiest,
most bitter day the writer has seen
in the United States senate in 15
years. The very air was surcharged
all the afternoon with bitter criti
cism, insinuations, incriminations and
ugly charges of all kinds on both
sides of the partisan aisle. Senators
all but came to blows, so fierce was
the debate.
All of the trouble came about over
the Wheeler resolution, introduced
by Senator Wheeler, of Montana, de
claring it to be the sense of the U.
S. senate that Attorney General
Daugherty resign or be asked by the
president to resign his post and get
out of the cabinet.
On the Republican side Senator
Willis, of Ohio, was the only senator
who in any way attempted to sav
anything in behalf of the attorney
general and Democratic senators
charged that Senator Willis had at
tempted to “pack the committee” to
be appointed by the chairman pro
tem, if he is permitted to make the
selections, »» is the customary rule.
But in the Wheeler resolution the
Montana senator undertook to have
the senate depart from the old cus-
Enemies Thought
Klan to he Dead;
Lease Land Tract
PITTSBURGH. KAN’., March 1
Just as enemies of the Ku Klux Klan
were circulating reports that Pitts
burgh Klan was about to disband,
consternation was created among
them by announcement of the leas
ing of a 38 acre tract near here to
be used as county headquarters. The
lease runs for several years, with an
option to purchase, and it is likely
the tract will be purchased and made
into a permanent home for the body.
The tract contains several buildings
that may be used for lodge halls and
other purposes as well as a large
grand stand, race track and athletic
field.
CONGRESSMAN TO
PROBE SHOOTING
OF DRY VIOLATOR
Citizens of Stearns and
Benton Counties Said to
Be Wrought Up
MANY LAW VIOLATIONS
Representative Knutson to Car
ry On Own Investigation
at St. Cloud
ST. CLOUD. MINN.. March 3.—Ac
cording to the daily press. Congress
man Harold Knutson is much wrought
up over the shooting of one Nicholas
Lahr by prohibition agents who are
operating in and around St. Cloud.
It is evident that much pressure
has been brought to bear upon the
congressman by citizens and organi
zations of Stearns and Benton coun
ties. The newspapers report that pe
titions have been sent to Congress
man Harold Knutson. Senators Ship
stead and Johnson, asking for an in
vestigation of the shooting of Lahr
by federal dry agents.
It is natural to expect very little
support on the citizens of Benton and
Stearns counties in any real effort to
enforce the prohibition laws in that
part of Minnesota. These two coun
ties are largely populated by Roman
Catholic Germans, who are to
be anything but favorable towards
the prohibition laws of this country.
That there are large numbers of viola
tions of the prohibition amendment
in Stearns and Benton counties is
quite generally understood by those
who have observed conditions even
superficially. So when we read that
Congressman Knutson is giving at
tention to the Lahr shooting, we
readily understand the source of the
pressure which has been centered up
on him, demanding investigations.
“I am going to the bottom of the
affair," Knutson is alleged to have
declared, "and I will find who is re
sponsible. What we demand to know'
now, are the facts of the case. I am

committee to serve and named him

Eublicans charged all afternoon that
enator Wheeler was attempting to
serve both as prosecutor and a mem
ber of the jury that is to try the at
torney general.
' Senator Heflin, of Albama, in a
bristling speech got under the hide
of Senator Lenroot, of Wisconsin,
chairman of the public lands com
mittee and the two senators almost
called each other ugly names and did
about everything but get into a fist
fight.
Minority Leader Robinson lost his
temper over Senator Bruce, of Mary
land, kicking over the party traces
and those two senators got into it
two or three times during the after
noon.
Senator Walsh, of Montana, was on
his feet many times during the fra
cas and other senators from the
northwestand south got into the
inixup frequently and altogether it
was a day of fireworks, political
fireworks, if you please. Evening saw
many senators in a had humor and it
was just the sort of a day that one
does not often witness in the high

of ours.

FRANK A. MUNSEY
Mr. Munsey, one of the largest
newspaper and magazine publishers
in the world, is supporting editori

Mellon tax plan which congress is
now considering.
It has only been of late years that
Mr. Munpey has become a power in
American journalism. He first pur
chased the New York Sun. Its morn
ing edition was dropped, giving way
to a consolidation with The Herald,
which he also purchased. Within the
year he has bought the New York

Sun. His latest venture is the pur
chase of The Evening Mail and its
consolidation with The Telegram, the
evening edition of the old Herald.
Munsey is also the owner of two Bal

According to a special dispatch
from Milwaukee Wednesday night,
the seven colored men arrested there
by the police on evidence supplied by
federal sleuths all came to Milwaukee
from the Twin Cities and are be
lieved to have obtained a regular sup
ply of morphine, cocaine and opium
from either St. Paul or Minneapolis.
Hope to Learn Source
Through questioning of the Mil
waukee prisoners today authorities,
it is declared, hope to learn definite
ly the source of the drugs they are
alleged to have peddled in the Mil
waukee underworld.
Federal agents believe through
their testimony they may be able to
link not only the Milwaukee prison
ers, but perhaps Mrs. Hitchcock and
Harbin as well with a single drug
ring operating in the northwest.
While the colored men are thought
to have had only minor parts in the
distribution of the narcotics brought
from the Twin Cities, officials are
confident they can tell from whom
they obtained their supplies in the
Twin Cities.

Somebody with lots of money and

MILWAUKEE, WIS., March L
—Add to the number of Wiscoiv

one that took place at Waukesha,
a short distance from Milwau
kee, on the evening of February
26. Read the list: Bayfield, Wau
sau, Antigo, Waukesha. Mok
law rules as often in Wisconsin
as in Red Russia, it seems.
The field man of the Ku Klux Klaa
had been working in Waukesha for
some time and laid plans for a big
meeting to be held in the cafeteria of
the Commercial hotel located at Five
Points in the heart of the business
section. Somehow, it now apj>eai%
advance information concerning the
proposed Klan meeting reached un-
American elements in the city, and
plans accordingly were laid by them
for the mob attack.
Attack Planned
Thefe is every reason to believe
that the anti-Klan outrage was care
fully planned. A persistent rumor
points to several prominent Wauke
sha un-Americans as leaders in the
mob activity.
The Klan meeting was scheduled
to take place in the evening at eight
o’clock. At that time the cafeteria
was jammed with people, most of
them mobbers who smashed their
way in. At the appointed time a na
tional Klan lecturer tiok a position
at the from, of and an
nounced that the would
open with a prayer. Catcalls, jeers,
wild howls and threats came from
several points in the cafeteria hall
with the announcement.

For a few minutes pandemonium
reigned supreme. In vain the speak
er tried to make himself heard, sud
denly a man jumped to a table and
waved a pistol. Loud yells were giv
en by many and it*s evident that they
were intended as signals, for a group
of men pushed their way into the
cafeteria and with drawn revolver*
announced that the meeting was at
an end.
At this time the lights went out£
somebody had cut the electric-light
wires. The entire three-story hotel
was left in darkness. A large num
ber rushed forward toward the
speaker. The mob’s intended victim
was spirited out through a side door
after Klan sympathizers had shielded
him from the rioters.
The Klan lecturer was taken to the
second story of the hotel, where he
remained until rescued by several
automobile loads of men who arrived
from Milwaukee. The Milwaukeeans
had little trouble in getting the Klaa
lecturer out of Waukesha.
Hotel Smashed Vp
The mob left the hotel badly
smashed up. Doors were broken in,
windows shattered, furniture ms
wrecked. The meeting was suppoadd
to have been entirely invitational,
but the mob insisted on marking it
public a la Russia.

While prohibition agents' were un

der J. B. (Ireeson and detectives lay
in wait in a downtown apartment, and
when a man appeared, arrested him
and seized a trunk and suitcase con
taining narcotics. There were 36*
ounces of drugs, worth $25,000 at
bootleggers’ prices. Henry Harbin,
who said he was from New York, waa
the man arrested. He was to be Ar
