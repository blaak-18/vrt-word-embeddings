MY CONCEPTION OP THE PRESIDENCY
*By Hashimura Togo.
Mr. Editor, some weeks in passed
by Hon. Taft & Hon. Bryan wrote
a delicious page of large tipe for
Collier Weekly on subjeck, “My
Conception of the Presidency.” Os
surely them two Presidents know
what-is they- are talking about.
Speeches of Hon. Taft is found in
rolls of Fame, and speeches of Hon.
Bryan is found in rolls of Edison
Phonograf. And yet there was some
thing deceptive & sidewise about
them articles they wrote for Collier’s,
because they sounded so. Hon. Taft
say:
“A President should be like Hon.
Roosevelt, only less so. He should
be like a piano of upright build with
some grand square qualities. He
should be the First Magistrate and
also the Principal Policeman in the
kingdom. He should be good as he
are lonesome. He should treat all
Trusts in a beastly manner and up
hold Truth & Justice so long as it
do not hurt National Prosperity. I
shall do all these things, thank you,
orders promptly attended to, tele
phone service day & night. Also T
shall look just as much like Hon.
Abe Lincoln as health & strength will
permit me to do it.”
Hon. Bryan say:
“A President should be like Hon.
Theodore Roosevelt only more so.
Malefactors, etc., needs not cringe
off from me for fearful that I will
burn up America when I am elect
ed. Because I can’t. A President
are only a bluff. He don’t amount
to a rolling-pin. Hon. American
Govt, are a system of checks &
balances, so a President are deli
ciously powerless when he wish to re
form it. I promise to be helpless as
possible. Could I reform Hon. Cur
rancy from jaggy path of deboehery
by feeding him Gold Cure or some
thing? Ah no! What could I do
with them naughty Currency when
Senator Alrich are tempting him
away with rakish eye-wink? To in
crease weakness of my position I am
willing to consult Hon. Vice-Presi
dent on all matters of no importance
and talk kindly to him on National
subjecks where common-sense are
not expected. I believe in deep
breathing & outdoor exercise, but I
are cross about that wooley tariff of
sheep and should be insulted if of
fered a second term. Otherways I
are willing to ack like a Majority on
all occasions and what I think about
Brownsville Affair are a matter of
private conscience which I refuse to
discuss by advice of Hon. Campaign
Manager. ’ ’
Mr. Editor, I entertain some scolds
for you. How sinful to ask them
there Hon. Candidates to write such
opinions! When a man expect to be
a President do you expect him to tell
the candied truth about what he
think of the job? When a man are
nominate for Dog Catcher he are
often sly and deceptive before elec
tion —how then you expect a Nomi
nee for Pres, of the U. S. to make
crystal speeches which might be saw
through at once and spoil everything?
Nobody what are wistful about a job
will tell exact truth about what he
think. If I ask for job of Hon.
Window Wash at Mills Bldg & Jan
itor Boss say: “Hashimura, told me
transparently what you think of this
job”—what I answer for reply? I
say: “It are a very delicate job of
extreme fineness. It are a high
horse privilege for Japanese Boy
to be able wash windows for Hon.
Mills. Though it require great skill
& couredge to shine such lofty glas‘s
pains, yet I flatten myself that I
got such a power more briskly than
other Japanese Boys which is apt tu
be laxy in sense of duty where it
should be tightest. Hon. Janitor, I
feel myself unworthy of such a jobs,
yet I know I ain’t. Therefore give
it to me because of merit.”
I say all them things, Mr. Editor,
because I am a candidate for them
high post of Window Wash. There
fore I am prejudicial about it. But
if Hon. Janitor ask Cousin Nogi, who
do not desire such a jobs because of
his lazy spine, what-say Cousin Nogi?
He-say: “A Window Wash require
some muscles, but very little intelli
gence. Hashimura Togo are not safe
to stand on such a altitudes because
he thinks poems; .therefore if he gets
it he will swim off of 10th story
window & burst his fooly neck.”
Hon. Taft & Hon. Bryan are too
sympathetick with such jobs to talk
straight. Why not ask some gentle
mans what never expects to be White
Housers to give view on Presidency?
Hon. Hearst on “My Conception
of the Presidency” would be very
bright & could get Hon. Brisbane to
write it for him. Hon. Alt.
Parker, Hon. Patty MeCarren, or
Hon. John Wanamaker would talk
deliciously true & sinical. But
do not ask Hon. Forker, please,
because he would write it, “My Con
ception of the President” & decuss
other nigger problems which are no
longer a delicacy.
I. Anazuma, Jananese barber,
where I go for get my cheek whittled,
say-me: “Who could express such
a conception about being a Pres, and
not lie about it?”
“I could,” is answer for me. “I
am best befatted for such a talk be
cause I are entirely unsympathetick
& not entitle to a white vote like
Hon. Booker Washington and other
darks. ’ ’
“Why you no write such concep
tion for Collier Weekly?” is snug
gestion from him.
“I are not yet requested,” is
erupt from me.
“You are a modish violet,” is vo
cal from Hon. Suds. 11 Therefore say
it secretly.”
“If I was President,” I rake
out, “I should be divided into 2
parts. The 1-2 part of me should be
radikal & kind of dangerous; but the
other 1-2 portion should safely set.
upon the Constitution and keep it
pressed. ’ ’
“Would such a double lives be de
cent?” commit Hon.
“In such high positions, yes,” I
dabble. “A ideel Pres, of these U.
S. should be a cross between Theo-
'St® Jeffersonian
dore Roosevelt & Chester A. Arthur.
With one hand he should affection
ately protect the interests of the
People while with the other he should
be nice to the people of the Interests.
If it are necessary for him to be 2
places at once he must go there.
When requested he must attend a
Idaho Miners’ Noyesy Barbecue fu’l
of malice for-them Hon. Malefactors;
but he must not neglect a invitation
to Insurance Scandalous Banquet
where he can set by Hon. Paul Mor
ton and talk like a Injunction. ”
“So shocky!” say I. Anazuma
with razor. “It are shamefully diffi
cult to shave such a two-faced Japa
nese.”
“In antique times of pagan
Rome, ’ ’ I dib, ‘‘there -was a delicious
ly heathen god named January who
was able to look in 2 directions with
a double face. On one side he had
a face like Hon. Judge Landis, on
the other a expression like Hon.
Judge Grosscup. When malefactors
of great wealth go to Judge Landis
side of them two-face idol they was
filled with shivers because of then*
sinful rebates; so they crawl around
to Judge Grosscup side and was for
given. But when malefactors of
great poverty get in front of them
Grosscup face to make kick against
Olive Oil Trust, they almost w T ent to
jail for their crimes, so they hurry
around to Judge Landis face and was
comforted to know that taking re
bates from Harriman was sinnier
than taking silverware from a Sol
diers’ Home.”
“I am delicious to know,” say
Hon. Anazuma who are studying to
be a Y. M. C. A., “that them heathen
idol January were bursted by hatch
ets of early Christian parents.”
“He were finally bursted,” I re
buke, “but he last for several 1000 s
of year & were a nicely successful
god. He were popular like a circus
for long lines of Hon. Politicians
what wish to learn-how. What-sav
Mr. Vergil, famous Roman poeter,
about them god January? He-say,
‘Get there, January!’ which have
been 'a politickal motto every since.”
“Have that disgusting January go*
—.any temples in America?” require
Hon. Anazuma.
“In Pennsylvania State Capitol
there is a pagan pictures of Hon.
Mat Quay and other local gods,”
I dib deceptively. “I shall not be
wonderful if portrait of Hon. Jan
uary are grafted among nearly ev
erything else in that famous art sa
loon.”
“When you are President how you
stand on publick ownership of R.
Rs?” require Hon. Barb.
“About publick ownership I are
safely insane,” I report. “Publick
- should be allowed to own R. Rs grad
ually. With each Pullman ticket
Hon. Passenger might get a blue
transfer which entitle him to .1
share R. R. stock if he present it at
office of Sec. of Agriculture 2,000,-
000 years from date.”
“Would American people get such
a ownership then?” ask he.
“What say Wm. Jenny Bryan
about publick ownership?” I reject.
“He-say, ‘Publick ownership of R.
Rs must take place in eventual time.’
Them 2,000,000 years from date will
be a ‘eventual time,’ won’t it not?”
‘‘ In 2,000,000 year what would
American publick own?” are ques
tion for Anazuma.
“At least they would own them
blue transfer slips,” I renig with de
ceptive expression of a Campaign
Contribution.
Late Sunday p. m. Arthur Kicka
hajama give to me for Campaign
Contribution a live dog which is a
Hon. Pup. It are a very infant mam
mal with a emotional tail and culti
vated by flees. Arthur rescue them
Dog while being kicked from a wharf
by a educated gentleman who was
drunk.
“It are a vulgar variety,” I snip
for objection because I are nervous
about expensive food for such a dum
friend.
“It may grow up to be refined,”
say Arthur carelessly.
“What breed of Dog are it?” is
next fuss from me.
“Not certainly sure,” say Arthur.
“Hon. Strunsky who are a sport say,
‘lt are a he-dog, ’ so I suppose it are
such a breed.”
I regard this Hon. Pup with
thoughts. He throw me a very doggy
gaze & thump banzai on floor with
his snubbed appendix. My heart be
come soft-boiled with love. I can’t
not turn a dog away in such a hot
weather when he are apt to be bit .
by a rabbi & get it. So I possess
him by chains and enjoy worry about
his breed which are full of spots
with a bursted ear.
S. Wanda, Japanese Socialist, say
he should be named “Tariff” because
he need revising immediately. Cous
in Nogi announce, “He should be
named ‘lnjunction’ because he were
kicked off a platform.”
“I shall not call such names to a
mere dog,” 1 gratify. “Therefore
I shall chisen him ‘O-Fido’ what was
name of a famous Japanese grocer
what live happy for 1000 year and
died from being too joyful.”
So I got O-Fido in bedstead with
me where he practise barks at Hon.
Rats all night till Japanese persons
sleeping in this house can not do so "
& report tearful complaints to Hon.
Landlord who is a malefactor & say:
“You are a nuisance besides 3-week
remit with rent.” Moral of this is:
Be kind to them dum beasts & you
will get paid off.
Yours truly,
HASHIMURA TOGO.
iS.P.—Who will be the First Baby
in the Land now that Quentin Roose
velt have refused a Third Term?
Little Charlie Taft are studying
childish pranks so he can hold them
position of Publick Cuteness. Hon.
Steam Shovelers’ Union of Panama
is first to give Hon. Taft a union
caa-d. Hon. Steam Rollers’ Union
should be ashamed of their slowness!
