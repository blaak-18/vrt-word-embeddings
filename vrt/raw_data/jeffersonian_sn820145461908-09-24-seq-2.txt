Public Opinion Throughout the Union
THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY.
If Hearst were to quit the In
dependence party, said party would
be dead that moment. Hearst fur
nishes the “dough” that is pay
ing the freight. Who furnishes it
to Hearst? Hearst is the party and
Hearst is in favor of the present
national bank money system and
wants to postpone government owner
ship of railroads until the govern
ment proves its ability to run the
telegraph, which means that he
isn’t a. government railroad man.
Watson says Hearst is an ally of
Harriman, the railroad king. We
became convinced some months ago
that he w T as in cahoots with J.
Pierpont Morgan and. of course that
means Rockefeller also. W e wait
ed and watched for six years to find
out what Hearst was driving at,
and especially wanted to learn
whether he was with Wall Street or
the people on the money question.
He ignored that question until last
Spring, when he came out in favor
of the present money system. It
dawned on us then that Hearst’s
business was to take care of the union
labor voters and see that they and
the farmers did not get together.—

BRYAN AND BROWNSVILLE.
We are not wont to speak in de
rogation of candidates that we do
not support, but rather leave it to
others to do so, while we content our
selves with setting forth the reasons
why you should support our candi
date. However, in the approaching
election for President, we feel that
we would be recreant to our plain
duty, did not we state a few plain
facts to our readers. Mr. Bryan is
catering to the negro vote, and if
elected will owe his election to the
negro.
In the iSoutfi we have been en
deavoring to eliminate the ignorant
negro voter from politics. We have
seen in the past the disastrous re
sults of negro participation in poli
ties. We have always been taught
that the Republican party was the
negro’s best political friend, and the
Democratic party stood in a measure
fqr white supremacy,
Suph has really been the case up to
now. Now’, Mr. Bryan, ip the mad
greed for the high office to which he
aspires, is catering to the negro vote
in such away that his election will
mean the Africanizing of the Demo
cratic party,
What proof have we that this is
so? What means the support he is
getting from the negroes? What did
he say to that negro delegation that
went to him to know his position on
the Brownsville riot? He, himself,
has not said. The delegation went
away satisfied. Went away to work
for Bryan’s election. What means
the flopping of the former Lincoln,
Neb., negro Republican club, march
ing out with Bryan banners flying,
and being entertained with fried
chicken on the front lawn, at Fair
view? What means the flopping of
Cornelius Hughes, the colored lead
er of the Independence League? It
simply means this, that Bryan, a
shrewd politician, saw that it was a
good time to capture the negro vote,
on account of President Roosevelt’s
action in the Brownsville matter; he
utilized the opportunity. What his
election would mean toward retard
ing the march towards white su
premacy in the South no man can
foresee. Why not rebuke the effort
of Bryan to negroize the Democratic
party by breaking up the solid South
politically? Give your support to
a native born Southerner—one of the
South’s greatest and most patriotic
citizens, Hon. Thomas E. Watson. —
Royston Record.
A BAD DAY FOR GOMPERS.
Yesterday was a bad day for Gom
pers. Several spokes were placed in
his plan to deliver the labor vote. He
looks in his vest pocket and does not
find there what he told Bryan was
there.
The Cigarmakers’ Union, from
which Gompers formerly held a work
ing card, has passed resolutions con
demning Gompers and the executive
council of the American Federation
of Labor for having by their action
“retarded the progress of organiz
ed labor.” The district organization
of the machinists, representing
eighteen locals and 15,000 members,
even more strongly assails the Gom
pers delivery plan. The hotel and
restaurant men’s union, not satis
fied to lay on the table the request
of Gompers for funds for Bryan,
passed a contemptuous resolution to
throw it “under” the table.
Gompers has affronted the conserva
tive wing of trades unionism, which
believes that the unions should con
tinue their traditional abstention
from partisan politics, and which is
disposed to think that steady jobs at
high wages are more valuable than
the right to throw bricks when there
is a labor dispute. He has also
affronted the radical element of
trades unionism, which holds that
Debs and the Socialists are the true
saviors rather than Bryan and the
Democrats. Adding to the uneasi
ness of Gompers was the hot shot
that Cannon fired against the pro
position that certain men in this
country should possess rights not
possessed by their fellows. —New
York Globe,
An exchange carries a headline
announcing that “Negroes are Flock
ing to Bryan.” That’s not very
consoling to democrats who have al
ways argued that they were demo
crats because the democratic party is
the white man’s party in the south, —
Nashville (Ga.) Herald.
Don’t tell us that the men of the
south, and especially the voters of
the proud old state of Georgia, are
going to submit tamely to being
dragged around forever like dogs
by the south-hating, negro-loving de
mocrats of the north. —Meigs Review.
Jeffersonian
TOM WATSON IN BAINBRIDGE.
According to previous announce
ment the Populist leader and candi
date for President, Hon. Thomas E.
Watson, held forth at the court house
yesterday. The weather was in
clement and fitful rains marked the
day, notwithstanding, the auditorium
of the court house was packed with
an expectant audience, all parts of
the county being represented.
At eleven o’clock the meeting con
vened. Hon. Ben E. Russell, an old
time friend and conferee of Mr. Wat
son in the Georgia Legislature of
1882-1883, when that distinguished
gentleman first entered the field of
political life, introduced him to the
audience.
In the crowd were many of the old
line Populists who had supported Mr.
Watson from the formation of that
party, and all seemed as intense and
loyal in their zeal to the party lead
er as they were in the halcyon days
of yore. Captffin Russell briefly
epitomized the political and literary
record of Mr. Watson in which he
was liberally applauded. Upon
rising the Populist leader was greeted
with loud cheers, and the audience
settled itself to be entertained for an
hour and a half with a rare treat on
political narration, wit, humor, in
vective and oratory.
He excoriated both of the old
political parties. He showed up the
inconsistencies of William J. Bryan,
whom he continually dubbed as “Wil
liam J. Peerless,” much to the amuse
ment of his hearers. He told of how
he and the Peerless were both ram
pant Populists in 1892 and supported
the national ticket headed by General
Weaver, and how numerous reforms
that have been accomplished by the
Democratic party were incubated by
the Populists. His picture of the
utter poliical hopelessness of the
South in following blindly the Demo
cratic leaders of the North in prefer
ence to her own, was not only pa
thetic but everlastingly true, and was
approved by his hearers.
In reply so the oft repeated charge
that he was leading a forlorn hope
with no expectation of ever being
elected president, he said that he
had been advocating the principles
of Populism for eighteen years, and
that if his life is spared he would be
found true to them eighteen years
more. He had considerable to say
about Jeffersonian Democracy, and
claimed that he was the only Demo
crat in the race, with which statement
many in the crowd seemed to agree.
He spoke of his consistent and
eternal fealty to the South, which was
loudly applauded.
Taken altogether Mr. Watson made
a most favorable impression here —
the people being in a very receptive
mood for original political informa
tion just now,
Personally Mr, Watson left a fine
impression here, and those who were
fortunate enough to hear him despite
the inclement weather were amply
repaid by a notable speech. Quite a
number of ladies were among the
auditors.
Mr. Watson was gttest of the Bon
Air hotel during his stay and the
reception committee was headed by
Mr. C. E. Parker and Dr. J. N.
Mathews. —Bainbridge Searchlight.
NOT WORTH WHILE.
The Macon Telegraph is of course
clearly within its rights when it re
fers to the Chattanooga speech of
the Hon. John Temple Graves call
ing on Mr. Bryan to nominate the
Hon. Theodore Roosevelt and let
the presidency go at that, but it
occurs to us that it wastes good
editorial space by giving the matter
a stickful and a half of type.—
Daily Times (Chattanooga).
Why great need for so much cam
paign funds? Fifty years ago a few
thousand dollars was all that was
needed to elect presidents like Lin
coln now they talk of upwards of a
half million as needed to conduct
a campaign to elect a Trust and
Corporation tool to preside in the
White House. —People’s Voice, Nor

THE OXFORD INCIDENT.
A negro cuts a white woman’s
throat and undertakes to outrage her
innocent young daughter. The mob,
led by an ex-United States senator,
batters down the doors of the jail
after three or four hours’ hard work,
shoots the negro to death and then
hangs him to a telephone pole . All,
without the least secrecy or Stealthi
ness. These fearful occurrences are
becoming daily and yet, the fool says,
“There is no race problem.”—The
Issue.
It is only a few months ago since
a Federal jury indicted one Peter S.
Grossup, the Federal judg’e who
reversed Judge Landis’ $29,000,000
fine of Standard Oil. Indicted him
for being a stockholder and director
in an electric street ear corporation
at Mattoon, Illinois, which corporation
was held to be criminally negligent
in the killing of eleven of its pas
sengers and crippling many others.
Now if an ordinary grand jury can
thus indict a Federal Judge, how does
this same Judge get big enough to
reverse another Fed Judge? In fact
this Judge business has got tangled
up until it’s mighty hard to tell who’s
who.—Smith Center (Kan.) Mes

As it has been used for the election

the Republican national committee,
and will be handsomely rewarded. —
