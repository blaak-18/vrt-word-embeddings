~,;L·; ·
: LAFAYrTE. I.A., AUG. 5, IS95. i
To the IAr'. Alofvor nnd nlembers of the
City Council of the towon of Lafayette.
Your undersigned committee, appointed
to compile the charter of the town of Lafa
yette wish amendments and all ord!inances
of the city council, beg leave to make this
report: -
That they have been unable to get the
hooks wherein the proceedings of the city
council and ordiances were kept previous to
S169; the outgoing secretary and treasurer
not having them in his possession and being
tunable to account for their dlisapp._rance;
Swe have compiled all the ordinances front
that date up to the present, under proper
headings and in alphabetical order; also the
original act of the Legislature incorporating
the town, together with legislative amend
nmeats thereof as well as those adopted by
the people at the election held for that
parlipose in 1884.
We will call your attention to the fact
that section nine of act of the Legislatu-e
apt:roved March Is, I5336, incorporating this
town, provides that the clerk of the council
shall keep two books; one bound book in
which shall be recorded all the laws and or
dinance passed by the council, signed by the
president (Mayor) and countersigned by the
Clerk (Secretary), and a book in which shall
be recorded the proceedings of the City
Council.
This as far as we have been able to dis
cover has never been complied with in res
pect to number of books; there being only
one wherein proceedings of the council and
ordinances are kept together.
We believe that this should he done. It
would facilitate the members of the council,
as well as the public, in being conversant
with the resolution and ordinances in exis
tence. The book for ordinances should
have an alphabetical index, wherin it should
be made the duty of the clerk to enter in its
proper place 'all ordinances passed by the
council; whereas as it now is, it requires a
great deal of labor to do so, when it is con
sidered that one would have to search all
thr. ugh the book.
We would recommend that the council
outhorize the clerk to purchase a book for
that purpose, wherein it shall be his duty to
I record all laws and ordinances to be signed
by the Mayor and countersigned by himself.
As to those brdinances already passed and
t compiled by us, and annexed to this report,
we would suggest that the council have them
recorded and indexed in the hook when
I procured, or be printed in pamphlets for the
use of the council and the public or both as
it might appear advisable.
Respectfully submitted,
OaTItER C. MOUTON,
T. M. iroSSAT,
J. D). TRAIIAN,
Moved by Jos. Ducote, seconded by Leo
Doucet, that committee on compiling the
above be tendered vote of thanks for their
laborious task which they have so well done,
and same be accepted and committee be e dis
charged.
Moved by O. C. Mouton, seconded by
J. O. Leblanc, that secretary be instructed
to purchase record book in which to record
act of incorporation and all ordinances
separate from minutes which have been ar
ranged alphabetically.
Moved Iby Dr. Trahan, seconded by Jos.
Ducote, that ordinances be transcribed in
new book for said purpose and also that
; several numbers be printed in pamphlets
from for the use of council and public in
general. Also that cotmittee of two be
appointed to confer with printing houses for
c the purpose of getting best figures. The
tmayor appointed on said committee Dr. J.
