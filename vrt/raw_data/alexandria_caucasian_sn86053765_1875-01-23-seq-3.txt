Th« E«port of tho Congressional Com
mittee.
Oqr tote»t papers bruitf us tho
fit II text of tlie report of the Sub
Comraittce neiit to Now Orleans to
report an to the condition «1 aflairs
In Louisiana, which is too lengthy
for us to republish in this issue.
Wo ré#rct this, ns the report is n
masterly exposition of the cotidi
tion of affairs iu our State, ami a
complete vindication of her white
citizens from the odious slanders
that bave been heaped upon their
fair name without «tint and with
unvarying malignity. It is gratify
ing to know that amid th» prevail
ing corruption which characterizes
those who fill the high places of f In
land, there nt least three men who
can judge (airly, and who dure to
decide honestly, even iu the face of
the immense pressnro brought to
bear upon both their fairness and
honesty. The two following sen
tences will endear the names of
Messrs Charles Foster, William
Walter Phelps and Clarkson N.
Potter, to Louisianians for ninny
long year« to come:
«» Without now icferring to oth
er instances, we are const rained to
declare that tins action of the Return
ing Board on the whole, watt arbitra
ry , unjust , and in our opinion illegal ;
and that thin arbitrary, unjust and
illegal action atom prevented the, re
turn by the Hoard of a majority oj
Comcrratives to the Lower Jlome."
• • * •
" " A ltd the result wan that in No
vember 1K74, the people of I he State
of lmiisiana did fairly hare a free,
peaceable and full Registration, ami
election in which a ; clear f -on serra
tire majority wan elected to the lower
house of the Législature , of which
majority the Cjonncr rat ires were de
prired by the unjust, illegal and ar
bitrary action of the Returning
Hoard."
It is known toonr readers that
our parish figured rather exton
»lively before the Committee and
that many of our citizens testified
before them. Our representative
oti the Returning Board Mat Wells,
whose partisan course, to call his
nction no harsher name, has lead
ed him with intamy and coverd his
name with n heap of shame and
dishonesty from which he can nev
er escape, meets with a rough
handling from the Committee. We
must content ourselves with pub
lishing an extract from the Com
m it tee's report, giving in full what
they say of the election in Repides."
u TI hi Parish of'Rapides chose
three meipbers to the Legislature.
The returns elected »II three Con
servatives. When the proofs clos
ed tho only paper tiled wi It the
Returning Board was tho affidavit
of the United States Supervisor,
that tho cU'ction was in all respects
full, fair and Ire«?. It was not
known in tlio parish that any con
test existed npiiHt these lueiubers.
They left their homes and proceed
ed to New Orleans to bo present at, j
the opening of the Legislature, no
intimidation of eontesfin^ their
«eats or objecting to their election
having boon given by their oppo
uoiiLs; atone of their last meetings
the ReturiiNig Itoard declared all
tho Republican members elected
from that parish. When the pa
per« of the Returning Hoard were
produced before your Committee
there was found among them an ai
lidavit by Mr. Wèlls, the President
ot the Hoard, declaring that liitimi
dation had existed at certain polls
in that palish, and that the returns
from these polls should therefore
be rejected. The counsel for the
Democratic coimnittee testified Hint
they had no opportunity to 'contra !
diet tho statements of this paper ;
that they had never seen or known
e , f , ., ,
ot it. before, and that upon an ex
ami nation of the papers before the
Board, when the proofs closed it
was not among them The eoun-l
sel tor the Republican Committee
reserved the right to uiako expia
nation upon this point, but ollered
none. The affidavit was dated the;
— day of December, 1874. It ap
pealed that Governor Wells was
not himself in the parish 011 the
day of election, and though at the
opening of their first session your
committee declared their intention
to examine, into the action of tlie;
Returning Board, Gov. Wells uev
er came forward as a witness. At
the close of our proceedings leave
was asked that his deposition inighi
be given 111. This was declined,
and Mr. Wells was invited to ap
pear before the committee, but he j
never came. Leave was also given
for taking lus testimony by a com
missiouer if ho desnvd, but was |
not availed of. Your committee
are, therefore, constrained to de
clare that the action of the L'e
turning Hoard, in rejecting these
returns# in thojmrish ol Rapides,
and giving the /seats for that, pur
ish to the Ifepubiican eandidates,j
was ai bit rary, unfair, and without,
warrant ot law. It Ihe eoimnii Iee|
V I I • I .1 i
were to go behind the papers be
fore, tho board and consider the
leged charge, of intimidation upon,
tho proofs before the committee, j
their Unding would necessarily
the same. It was asserted in (iov.
Well's ailidavit thai, Ihe McKncry
oflicials had usurped the offices <#t
the, parish, and thereby inI imidated
voters. Immediately after t.hn I it h
of (September, when the Kellogg
authorities in New Orleans were
pur, oui by the I'etiu authorities,
certain changes took place iu some
of the parislies. When the news
from New Orleans reached these
paiishes the MclO/iery oflicials «Im
inaiided their places of the Kellogg
oflicials, and I hey were at once
given up. When the Federal <Iov
eminent intervened and unseated
the McFnerv authorities, the Ivel
logg officials demanded and rceeh
ed back I heir places ; but in L'a
pides some time seems to have
elapsed before the Kellogg oflicials
took their places hack. Indeed,
the MoKncry Register of Heeds
was still acting as such when your
committee was iu New Orleans, I lie
Kellogg Register never having
come to reclaim tho place which
was said to be worth nothing in
Kupidos. The Kellogg clerk was
Mr. Wells'sou ; having yielded hi.-,
place to the MoHuery competitor
in September, he does not, appear
to have reclaimed it, and lie was
accordingly sent, for alter the elce
tio'i to ironie from his residence,
some miles distant, to sign the re
turns of the election, which he did.
Your committee are at a loss to see
ill their action any inlimidalion of
Mr. Wells; still less of t ho clcctor s
of I,he parish, it. so happens that
the parish was taken as a sample
parish of intimidation, many wit
liesses from which of both parlies,
were examined with reference to i!.
They show beyond question thai
there was a full, live, fair and
peaceful elect ion and registiatioii
there. T here was no evidence of
any intimidation ol voters piaetic,
ed on the day of the election, al
though it was asserted that intimi
dation of colored men before tin
election had been effected by
threats of refusal to employ them,
or to discharge them if they voted
■ !
tho Republican ticket; no evidence
either of discharge or of refusal (o
employ was produced. Certain
witnesses, themselves every one.
officeholders, testified generally to
such action, but, haidly any one
was able to speciiy a single i;i
stance in which ho had heatd any
employee so threatened or dis
charged, or knew of any employee
so threatened or discharged. Not
a single colored mall fhrouglioul
the entire parish was produced to
testily cither to such ttireats or t.o
tho cxceiilion ol such a purpose,
either before or alter (lie, election.
The action of the, Returning IPianl
in the parish of Rapides alone
changed t lio political complexion
of the. lower house, but t hej,r action
in other pai ish us was eqiiaily ob
jectionahle."
