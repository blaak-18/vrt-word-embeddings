Symptoms of a uauase Liverw
D)AIN in the right side, under the
r edge o( the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite -
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen.
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly pensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be bi
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely ai
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend -
the disease, but cases have occurred

electric fash of startling brilliancy,
piercing the corridors glium and el
momentarily impressing the malden i
with dismay, revealed an open por- d

she plainly saw In the opposite ei
corner of the room, an openling l ft
the floor similar to a hilps hatch
way; the lid or door was raled, and n
a stairway led below. PasLamts a
stood with his back to the maiden P
holding up the lid. A man's steps t
was herd ascending the stairs. A
short time afterwards she heard the ti
door softly closed.
"He is wake," said one of the ``
men. It was Ninrss. ft
"Let no one enter his ell to nlht,"

IcrYtLi was not a little terrified, i1
she knew not to what insults she ua
would hie subjected, i discovered nla
her present situation. Her breath.- t
log was fast, and her heart beat load Ul
enough she thought to be hb by b

A bold resolution suddenly seized
