Editors Caucasian :
Gentlemen Feeling confident
that y our paper has a gr e a ter cir
culation among the white people of
the Parish of Grant, owing to the
true, and nndeflled doctrine it ad
vocates, you will please give notice
through your columns, that the peo
ple of the Parish of Grant, in oppo
Hition to negro rule and snprenA
ojv wil£ convene at Colfax , on
Saturday , the 25th inst, in Mass
Meeting, for the purpose of organ
izing the White 'Man's Party, for
the Fall campaign.
Very Respectfully,
DUNN & McCAIN.
The State Cosivsntian at AlmiiAia.
The papers are taking up our .call
and it is now certain that the Con
vention will be held either at Alex
andria or at Baton Bouge. Our
town is more central than Baton
Bouge, and besides being more
convenient to a majority of the peo
pie of the State, we can and do
offer all the facilities and accom
modations that "Baton IJouge can
proffer.
Let us have it here and fix your
own time ! September as suggest
ed by tbeOpelousas Courier, in too
late. The 3d of August fixed upon
by the Democrat and ourselves is
now too soon. Suppose we say
Saturday, September 1st.
<- Thk Mails. —Iii response to-our question
in onr last issue m to who wm to blame
for the fui il are of otir mails« ColN. L. Me
Gi nni«, tbe obliging Mid gentlemanly
agent of tbe mail contractor and Superin
tendent of tbe stage line, 'informs as that
the fhult lies with the slow boats which
•re now bringing tbe mails from New Or
leans to the month at Red River. He
osys that the Pargond is «he only boat that
gets to the month on soheddle time regu
larly— that the others ate frequently be
hind time—that the stage always wait?
one hear and that he oan wait no longer
because their contract obligee them ' to
reach hero at a certain time, and that be
has to make np the one honr on the road
by extra hard driving of his borte«. W©
Nave no doubt that this is so and that Col.
McGinnis does all he ean do-to give ns reg
ular mails. He has just returned from a
trip of personal inspection to the month
and we are gratified to record that tbe
mails are now running regularly. -We are,
no chronic grambter and While we shall
always censure neglect, we ara ever ready
to praise the mail contractor for regularity
and promptness. Keep it op gentlemen,
and wo are yarns truly!

THAT RAILBOAS SCHTlfl
We are again in the Iftidst
für ore about tlieBail Boad tram
New Orleans to Shres «port Thia
time it is tie Louisiaiia Central
Bail fttcjf Company, wi# want ua to
give them a bonus. Mr. F. W.
Kellogg, one of the incorporators,
we believe, agent at least, for that
company, reached here on Monday
and called a meeting at the Town
Hall on that night where be deliv
ered a somewhat lengthy and rath
er humorous address on Bail Boad
matters in particular, and all other
subjects generally. We have nö
doubt that lie is a very nice old
gentleman and it is principally on
that account we regret that we
conceive it to be our duty as. a pub
lic journalist to oppose his scheme
with all the vigor we possess.
To get inmedias res. On Tuesday
last he submitted in writing to the
Police Jury« then in session the fol
lowing proposition:
* That thePplice Jury should sub
mit to the people of this parish for
specially held for that purpose, an
agreement in writing that the)
would donate to the Louisiana Cen
tral Bail way Company Three Huß
dred Thoummd Dollars in bonds—
payable twenty years after date,
and bearing seven per cent interest,
on the following condition; vis:
That when they have built the
road from Alexandria to Lccompte
and equipped it with rolling stock
they are to have Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars of that amount
in bonds of the parish, and when
they shall have completed the road
through the parish, they are to
have the other One Hundred Thou
their decision, at an election to be
sand Dollars. This is substantial
ly their proposition. Ko request
that we take stock to that amount
No proposal that we should loan
them that amount and take a mort
gage, even a second mortgage, upon
the road to secure ourselves, but
they want a donation, a giß, a grat
uitous grant to them of that amount.
The Police Ju^ very wisely and
sensibly laid the matter on the ta
ble^ under advisement until their
meeting in September next Now
we-wish to consider this rather bold
and somewhat brazen proposition
and to lay it before our readers in
its true lightj.so that if it ever is
put before them for their vote, they
may at least know what they are
doing.
In tho first place, Mr. Kel
logg gives ns no guaranty that Mr.
Eber B. Ward of Michigan, intends
to invest one dollar in this enter
prise, to use a slang expression—
that he "means business." It is
true he did talk about Mr. Ward
and about Tom Scott, the Bail Boad
King, but in business matters we
want more than "talk," we want
facts and figure» We do not be
lieve that either Mr. Ward or Mr.
Tom Scott are big enough fools to
bring and invest in the State ot
Louisiana, under its present State
government, the millions of fash
money that it will take to build a
Bail Boad from Vermillionville to
Shreveport We won't believe'that
they are so demented until we see
documentary evidence of the fact;
something move is needed than the
mere obtaining ot* a charter from
the Kaugaroo Legislature of Lou
iaiana. The very same Legislature
which paused a Funding Bill pro
posing to repudiate Twenty Seven
Millions Dollars of as valid debts
against the State as this debt
would be against this Parish. That
is too thin, you know 1
In the next place. The point which
snggsstnitsélf st once to any one is;
What gu a ran ty do you propose to
give as that even if you dago to
work sad complete the short road
of s U t i oen miles from Alexandria to
Leoompte, and we give yon the
#200,000 in 7 per cent bonds, that
you will ever build another foot of
the road to-connect Shreveport and
New Orleans T
We propounded this query to Mr.
Kellogg r and his answer was that
the only guaranty he proposes to
give is his interest in the com
pletion of the road. But, said we.
that sixteen miles of road, and
ba*e got and sold oar T-20 bonds.
piniwwiwiw.
suppose that after you have built
you conclude that it is not to your
interest to complete tip rä|g, where
then do We
"yon mm ha
ajsdrta to
ppied; it ma;
want to
int "Ah* fi$ said—
he road frfll| Alex
pte." B we re
that we might not
dtar for so small
a whistle. It is more than proba
ble, that the Bayou Bapid# and
Cotile, the Pinewqods^on both sides,
of Bed Biver and the Bed »iver
people might not want to pay
such onerous taxes for the benefit
of Bayuu Bœuf exclusively
be could make no answer.
It will not have escaped tha i
ory of our ^pdacsbr that two ot
three years ago,. while Mr. James
B. Andrews was President, of the
Police Jury, a somewhat similar
proposition was made by a Mr, J
M. Corse» representing the Baton
Bouge and Vicksbnrg, or some oth
Bailroad, with thia difl ere n c^^t h st
he wanted only $100^00 and that
was not to be given him untü the
road was in complete £unuing order
and the cars Carrying yaiwangergaDd
freight from one end of the parish
the other. This proposition was
defeated in tbePoiiee Jury, beeadse
there was a Mr. Edwards, here rep
cgsenting what was to he the Ix>ui
siana Central Bail Road Company,
when they got their Charter, the
big gun of which concern was to
be Mr. Eher £ Ward of Michigan.
This Company proposed to build
the road tor "nothing if they could
only get their Charter. "They didn't
want and didn't expect a single
cent from the people." They were
going to build it with their own
money, ând of course, we refused
to give Corse #100,000 to do what
these gentlemen proposed to do
gratuitously. Now the only differ
between this and the old con
cern is that they have substituted
the word "Bailway"-for 'T.iail Boad"
in their title, that they have got
tliteir Charter, that they have Mr.
Kellogg for ah agent instead of our
fat and over-sanguine friend Ed
wards, and that they talk mighty
aboht big Tom Scott.
The enquiry is a ; pertinent one
right here : Why is it„ that if yon
were so anxiout» to build your road
on your own account three years ago
you must have these heavy do
nations nowf Mr. Kellogg says,
"Oh ! the people must show an in
terest in the matter or we can't sell
our own bonds." That's all stuff
and balderdash ! What do the cap
italists care whether tbe people are
interested or iiotf They only look
at two things; is it sale? and does
it i)ay T
And again. Let us how count
figures ou tliHse gentlemen. Seven
per cent, on three hundred thousand
dollars is $21,000 a year, to be paid
semi-annually in greenbacks.
In twenty years this would
amount to $120,000. This added to
the original $300.000, also to be paid
in currency, would make the whole
debt $720,000. This is supposing
that the road was completed from
New Orleans to Shreveport;
Now let us see how we wou®
stand if they only built to road to
Lecompte and stopped there. They
do not propose to give ns any other
guaranty than their interest, that they
wiH go any further. And they are
to have the bonds when tbe sixteen
miles is completed. $200,000 at 7
per cent is $14,000 per year. This
for twenty yéars would make $280,
000 in interest. Add this tp the or
iginal $200,000 and we wonld pay
tor this sixteen miles bf road, $480,
000. The extreme limits of the par
ish in a straight line would not be
much, if any, over forty miles.
Then forty into $720,000 gives a
quotient of $18,000 per mile, that
we wonld have paid in the first case,
1. e. supposing that they btrild the
road through. Taking the second
case and supposing that they onl;
bnild it to Lecompte, sixteen miles,
and dividing , $480,000 by sixteen
we have s quotient of ($80,000) thir
ty thousand dollars per mile I And
this too as a donation. It we were
to take stock and have our voice in
the management of the road
might possibly d<», bat we would be
crazy to pay that n racfr then tor
such a Bail Boad. We would be
y Z . AV
fools, more than idiots to give thm
much money to somebody else. If
it
we are bound to have the road at
thafcpriee, let us sell our own bonds
«gd baiW and owif it ourselves.
The las* idea we with to present
Is the «Ktreme dangpr of fooling
lb tl® bond qnâÉon without
proper security and unquestionable
fswrswBtees. The poment these
bonds get Into the bands of this or
any other company,they would rush
offtoNewTork and sell them for
fcfcat (lief could
They want them made payable to
"bearer 9 and they wonld then pass

was ever buüt by the company to
which they wer? laaoed. Weconld
not plead as against an innocent
third holder, for a valuable eonsid
eration, before maturity, any of the
equities of onr nontraet with the
pony to whom we «Ivo them.
Ws want a Bail Bond provided
we can .getane on fair and equita
bte terrae Wn sre willing that our
Parish ahouidtake stoek in any res
aonable amount, or that vfà shall
loan onr credit to any reliable set of
men, provided wé are secured by
first mortgage on the track and roll
ing stock In our parish, but we are
violently opposed to making any
donations to this or any other Com
pany, to try an experiment, tho. rfe
suit of which we ean only surmise.
The increase in value of real estate
would rather "retard thau promote
white immigration in our parish
which we need more than anything
eise; because if they do not come
and buy our lands when they are
cheap, how are we to expect them
to come and buy them at an in
creased value V A Bail Boad lnigli
increase the interest in the cultiva
tion of sor lauds but that' would on
ly bring more negroes here, and
would increase our political troubles
It might bring about a fictitious
nse in the value of land, but it can
bring no real increase of value un
til our labor problem is solved and
our political situation improved.
The permanent value of our lands
depends upon, the solution of these
questions. It will certainly help us
but precious little to voluntarily
double a rate of taxation which is
bankrupting us now to pay. In
stead of helping Alexandria per
manently, our opinion is that a
through road from Shreveport to
New Orleans would build up Shreve
port and kill Alexandria as deSd as
a hammer. We will discuss this
question of the proposed benefit to
be derived from this road at great
er length in our next issue and give
the reasons upon which we base an
opinion so contrary to the general
ly received, idea prevailing here.
For the present we close by saying
that we stlnd, square and flat-foot
ed dead against this Bail Boad
any way h npon the terms offered by
them.

Ten Thousand Dollars a mile or One
Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars
to keep them a going on their own .ac
count, and we to have no voieo in the
management of the road.
Tltey have recorded n mortgage here
in favor of some " Loan and Indemni
ty C ompany for Six Millions of-DolIars
on-the rond, and no matter what con
t ract they were to make with us, that
mortgiige would always be ahead ot us
mid that Loan aud Indemnity Co.,
could at any time sell them oat and
cut us off from all equities ef ear con
tracts with this Company now here.
Besides, Six Millions of Dollnrs will
not build the road from Shreveporf to
Vermillionville, unless it costs only
$24,000 per mile, for they fix the dis
tance at 250 miles. If that is nil it
costs, in the fifst case they nsk us to
give them $18,000 per mile for the 40
miles from one-ftne of onr Parish to
the other, only $6,000 per mile less
.than the wlîble cost; and for the six
teen miles should they stop when they
got that finished, we will have paid
them $30,000 jßst mile or $6,000 per
mile more than it cost to build the
road that sixteen miles. We would
muke $96,000 by building that sixteen
miles ourselves, and giving it to the Com
pany! This $96.000 distributed so as
to pay the $6,000 a mile we are short
on the whole forty miles of parish line,
would Just make ns pay for sixteen
miles more, even, and add to this six
teen miles, tbe sixteen we had already
more than built and yre wonld have
entirely built 32 miles oat .of forty,
leaving them only 8 miles to build at
their own expense. This is just bow
tbe matter stands. The question is
are yon willing to do this Î
We are in favor of a Rail Road, bat
wo want in the first place, somebody
to bnild it with his own money. If we
can't get that we are willing to take
stock to a reasonable amount, say
$100,000 cash and no interest. If they
don't want as to take stock,, we are
willing to loan them, say $100,000 or
$200,000 and take a first mortgage on
the road to secure its retort, but we
are opposed to any donations to this
or ary other company. We want a
Rail Road, but we don't want it bad
enough to bnild it and then give it
away to somebody to run it. And fi
nally, if we have to do that and must
build it and give it away, let us give
it to some ot onr poor starving and al
ready over-taxed people at home,
iy We learn from a private letter from
NeW Orleans to a gentleman here, who

lever in the control of the corporation'
and were forced to submit to the most
exborhifant tariff in tlie
i
tion of their tariflb. The exhorCttânt
demands of Rail Road monopolies that
have been subsided- by tbe fierai
State and municipal government« cre
ated such dissatisfaetioa, on tbe part
of the producer, tfiat gave rise to tbat
powerful organization Called the Pa
trons of Husbandry, the great object of
which is to rednee the freight on their
products. Political meetings of tho
people of both parties for tbe last
three years bave censored Congress for
its lavish land grants^ and «obsidie« to
Kail Road companies; so the «onnd and
practical judgment of tbe people, after
years of expetience in those Statesand
cities where subsidies have been grant
ed is opposed to the policy aad princi
ple. There is no question that a Rail
Road giving us direet communication
with New Orleans and Shreveport, tbo
terminas of the Texas Pacific, would 0
be of almost incalculable benefit to this
city and parish. This great road will
nt some future day be constructed, as
the exactions of commerce will force it*
through. How long before this is done,
and whether any kind of aid that we
could legitimately give, would hasten
its completion, is a matter for consider
ation. The fact is, that tbe Rail Road
men who have been hammering at this
ronte, for many years, bave failed
to insprre any great ^amount of confi
dence in our community, that they
were in earnest iu tlieir intentions, and
really iu tended to complete the Road
instead of getting all they conld and
then speculate on their Charter privile
ges and subsidies. We bave frequent
ly heard, in the discussion of this ques
tion for the last several years, a large
class of the best and most conservative
thinking men in the parish—expresa
a willingness to assist in the building,
or extending aid to any company, by
the parish in its corporate capacity—
taking stock for which her bonds should
be given, and interest payable annual
ly. This following proposition seems
to meet with greater favor than any
that has been discussed. That tbe par
ish would agree to take stock to the
amount of Two or Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars in any company that
would build the road from New Or
leans, through tbe parish, .and issue
bonds with iuterest, payable annually
for the stock, the bonds not to be de
livered until the road was completed.
Perhaps this would be the only aid
that the people of thm parish would b»
willing to extend to any company, and
a great deal would be ssrid on both
sides of the question before even this
proposition was voted for..
