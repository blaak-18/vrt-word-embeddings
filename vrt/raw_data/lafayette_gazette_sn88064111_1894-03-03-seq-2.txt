MR. IH WITTS TIRADE.
Atlanta Constitutiot .
The friends of the Hon. Abram
S. Hewitt were deeply mortified by
his unseemly exhibition of his igno
rance, prejudice and impudence
before the Southern Society, of
New York, the other night.
Mr. Hewitt is under the impres
sion that he knows it all. He mis
takes his delusions for eonvictlonsj
and is under the inmpressioat that his
dyspepsia is a new kind of dynamic
force,
When he rose to address the
Southern Society be could not resist
the temptation to magnify himselfand
his section at the expense of his
audience. Acc6rding to him the
south monopolizes the ign6rance of
the continent and her senators and
congressmen are mere pigmies com
pared with their ante-bellum prede
ces'sots. ife arraigned the southern
leaders and did not hesitate toihold
them responsible for the present
stagnation.
This glib banquet orator's dispara
ging comments on the southern
statesmen of today need not dist4rb
our people. The New Yorker may
not be able to find Calhoun's suc
cessor in the south. BIe it so. We
of the south look in vain for Web
ster's successor in the north.
Anything more captious and child
ish than this littre exlplosion of sec
tional prejudice has not been heard
since the war: The sorttherst peo
pie know Mr. Hewitt and his new
school of statesmen only too well,
and they are not looking to them
for advice and instruction. It is
simply brazen audacity for the rep
resentatives of the eastern democra
cy to talk down to us in this fashion
after utilizing our votes. They pat
us on our backs in a jolly way when
a national' election is held and after
we have placed them in power they
Cooly inform us that we are pigmies
and fools-because the 1a 8 democratic
congressmen from the west and
south do not surrender their convic
tions and yield to the handful of
eastern democrats whostubbornly r'e
fuse to act with the majority. But
we do not propose to treat Mr. He
witt's scold seriously. There is no
glory in a tilt with a windmill. -
