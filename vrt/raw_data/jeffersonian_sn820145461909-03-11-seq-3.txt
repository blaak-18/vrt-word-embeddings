CAPTAIN JACK CRAWFORD
THE "POET SCOUT”
(In The Vanner of Gold)
ATTAIN JACK CRAW
FORD, the famous “Poet
Scout,” has many friends
among the readers of the
Banner of Gold, and all
will be glad to hear from
him again. The following
letter shows that he is
- -> still fighting for the exter
mination of the twin evils,w hiskey and
cigarettes, and that lhe considers the
Keeley Cure one of the most potent
factors in the work of reform:
On the Iron Trail, December 9, 1907.
Editor The Banner of Gold: It was
during World’s Fair time that, in com
pany with a number of Keeley grad
uates, I first visited the Keeley Insti
tute at Dwight, and ever since my en
tertainment there, whether around the
camp fire in my own wild West, out
under the stars, in the drawing rooms
of the effete East, or at great Chau
tauqua and Lyceum gatherings, I have
made special mention of the grand
work for God and humanity at the
Keeley institutions. And when today
I found a Banner of Gold in the sleep
er from Chicago to Creston, lowa, and
read the article on “Cigarettes and
Cigarettists,” by Elbert Hubbard, I
thought I would write you about my
last visit to the Hubbard ranch, the
Roycrofters, at East Aurora, N. Y.
Nowhere have I been more inspired
than among the Roycrofters, where in
dustry, unselfishness, co-operation,
love, truth and justice are more fully
exemplified than I have ever seen them
in any community, and only rarely in
any family where I have been a guest.
Elbert Hubbard is the simplest great
man I ever knew, and he is surrounded
by simplicity. Mrs. Hubbard is the
brainiest, busiest and best combina
tion of a woman I ever met, while
Miriam, the little daughter, who calls
me her “Old Pard” and “Uncle
Jack,” is the sweetest, best-behaved
and most brilliant child I have ever
known.
On Thanksgiving night Mr. Hubbard
advertised a Temperance Rally in
Emerson Hall, and the people of East
Aurora were invited. The hall was
packed and extra chairs and benches
were carried up from the floor below.
Modesty forbids me quoting from Mr.
Hubbard’s speech introducing the
speaker, but it was not unlike the in
closed, which appeared in The Philis
tine two years ago after my first visit
at Christmas time.
It was a great meeting and at it®
conclusion tw.o ministers and a large
delegation of blue ribboners gave me
cordial and hearty congratulations and
thanks. It was the opening campaign
against the saloons in East Aurora,
and just before election I shall go back
and take the stump for the people
against the saloon. My latest poem,
“The Womanhood of Man,” read for
the first time on that Thanksgiving
evening, will appear in the Philistine
for January. I enclose advance copy.
I am coming to Dwight again soon
as I get a day off, and I want the stu
dents of political and other economy
to invite their frends to the camp fire.
In conclusion let me say that for
thirty-five years I have conscientiously
fought for temperance and have talked
to tens of thousands of boys about the
evils of the cigarette, the dime novel
and the dime novel drama. I have put
not less than a hundred boys behind
prison bars out West who have admit
ted to me and to others that they at
tributed their fate to the cigarette
as a starter. The other evils followed.
I trust that the time is not far away
when cigarettes and dime novels will
be prohibited—for mad dogs and rat
tlesnakes are not as dangerous. Fra
ternally yours,
Capt. Jack Crawford.
Capt. Crawford has honestly earn
ed his titles. He is a real poet and a
real scout,—a man with a warrior’s
soul and heart of a woman. His
career as an army scout and frontiers
man was distinguished by brave deeds,
courage and fearlessness. His verse
is distinguished by its quaint humor
and its gentle spirit of optimism.
Captain Crawford is one of Nature’s
poets. He begun to make verses be
fore he could write his name. When
he enlisted, as a boy of sixteen, he
was only able to put his mark to the
paper, and he tells an interesting
story of how his first set of verses,
“The Forty-eighth” (his regiment)
was taken down by a wounded Zouave
who happened to be lying next to him
in the military hospital, and was print
ed and sung before he knew how to
read and write. His latest, and one
of his best poems, “The Womanhood
of Man,” appeared in the January
number of The Philistine. By per
mission of Elbert Hubbard we repro
duce it as follows:
.The Womanhood of Man.
There is gold in every fibre
Os the Womanhood of Man;
It has ebbed and flowed in blood and
tears
Since this old world began,
From the veins and souls of heroes
And the heroines, since the day
When women wept and Jesus died
To wash our sins away.
I am just an optimistic,
Reckless, bronco sort of chap;
Though I stand for peace and justice
I am always in a scrap;
But my ancestors were fighters
Since red warfare first began,
And my only saving grace is
In the Womanhood of Man.
I have prospected for treasure
In the gold lands of the West;
I have driven many a tunnel
In the mountain’s rugged breast;
And I’ve found each little leader,
From bedrock to surface pan,
Was a mother-loaded magnet
From the Womanhood of Man.
I have sunk down to the bedrock
In a wayward brother’s soul,
When the whispered name of
“mother,”
Caused the God-sent tears to roll
From an seeming barren desert
Down the cheeks, all bronzed with
tan;
It was God’s assay for “colors”
In the Womanhood of Man.
I have tested modest manhood
In the fiery front of war;
I have analyzed the metal
In the blood of many a scar,
Jeffersonian
And have found the lion-hearted,
Whole-souled hero of the clan
Was the optimistic product
Os the Womanhood of Man.
If you want to find the metal
That is twenty karats fine,
You must prospect on the surface
Ere you sink to strike the mine;
But you’ll find it in the tailings
If you ’ll test them with the pan —
Find the gold of strenuous manhood
In the Womanhood of Man.
I would rather “face the music”
When the wild Apaches yell,—
Rather face the hell of battle
Amid storms of shot and shell,
Than suppress the tears of gladness,
Or of sadness, while I can
Realize they are the essence
Os the Womanhood of Man.
’Tis the Womanhood of Manhood
That is always reaching out;
It has been my lone companion
While on many a dangerous scout;
And wherever fate may place me
I shall do the best I can,
To be worthy of the manhood
Os the Womanhood of Man.
Here is another poem which will
appear in the forthcoming volume.
It is appropriately named “Sunshine”
and Captain Crawford calls it his
creed and his credential:
. Sunshine.
I never like to see a man a ’rastlin’
with the dumps
’Cause in the game of life he doesn’t
always catch the trumps;
But I can always cotton to a free and
easy cuss
As takes his dose, and thanks the Lord
it isn’t any wuss.
There ain’t no us© o’ kickin’ and
swearin’ at your luck,
Yer can’t correct the trouble mor’n
you can drown a duck,
Remember, when beneath the load
your sufferin’ head is bowed,
That God ’ill sprinkle sunshine in the
trail of every cloud.
If you should see a fellow man with
trouble’s flag unfurled,
And lookin’ like he didn’t have a
friend in all the world,
Go up and slap him on the back, and
holler * ‘ How’d you do! ”
And grasp his hand so warm he’ll
know he has a friend in you.
Then ax him what’s a hurtin’ ’im, and
laugh his cares away,
And tell him that the darkest night is
just afore the day,
Don’t talk in graveyard palaver, but
■ay it right out loud,
That God ’ill sprinkle sunshine in the
trail of every cloud.
This world at best is but a hash of
pleasure and of pain.
Some days are bright and sunny, and
some all sloshed with rain,
And that’s just how it ought to be,
for when the clouds roll by,
We’ll know just how to ’preciate the
bright and smilin’ sky.
So learn to take it as it comes, and
don’t sweat at the pores,
Because the Lord’s opinion doesn’t co
incide with yours;
