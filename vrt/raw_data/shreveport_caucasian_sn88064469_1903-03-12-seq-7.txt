Austin, March 6.-A resolution was

in Howard county. The answer was
all is quiet.

rich people are employing big, strong
men to stand at the door of the filing
office, holding their place until the time
of filing. "Some of these men get $10
a day," continued Mr. Miller, "for hold

TEACH SINCERITY.
One Thing In W'hleh a Child Should
Ue Trrrtned.
Some little time ago a girl was left
alone in a great city. On all sides she
met with sympathy. People gushed
over her and said:
"Oh, you poor girl!"
"I am so sorry for you!"
"I wish I could do something to make
your life less lonely!"
Then they promptly went off and. he
ing busy with their friends and their
festivities and their families, forgot all
about her, and
she was lonely
as much as any
one cares about
being in this
world, which
was leanllt for
good things.
At first she was
grateful for the
words of syn
pathy, but in the
end, after she
had heard half a
hundred times,
"I'm so sorry for
you!" "I wish
you could have
more pleasure!"
"It's such a pity
a nice young girl
like you should
not be married,
with a home of
her own!"
"What a shame
it Is you don't
know more peo
ple!" etc.. she
used to loathe nONEST SYMPATHY.
the peophl who slid those things to her,
because she had found out they didn't
mean what they said. If they had,
they would have put themselves out a
little, would have introduced her to
people, would have put her on the road
toward bettering herself.
But It was easier to talk than to do.
In the end they made her lose her
faith in all human nature. wlich is a
bad conclusion.
Now, this is a lesson to teach chIl
dren from their earliest years. Symn
ahy --is-a --great t1,hig, but -deedst, no
matter how small, are Infinitely better.
You may not bhe able to do much, but
do what little you ca;l. Say, "I'm sor
ry," if you will, but don't say, "I wish
I could do this and that," when you
don't wish any such thing. If you did
wish it, you would help toward it--that
is, don't say so unless you mean to help
the one you are saying it to. That is
the true test of sincerity, and sincerity
is what all women stand in great need
of. HELEN CLIFTON.

Plashion Notes.
Among all the new things the black
goods surpass all others in elegance.
There are voiles, silk and wool crapes.
etamines. mystral. canvas, zibeline
canvas with long hairs over the sur
face, voile plumetis, a delicately light
all wool fabric; striped voile, crepe de
paris, fancy cravenette mohair and
openwork mohairs. Mohair is to be a
fashionable material, and that of this
season is much softer and silkier than
any before woven. All the voiles, or
veilings, in plain English. are produced.
and, though generally of plain, smooth
surface, some of them have fancy
woven lacelike stripes. The mystral
etamines are very elegant.
Crashes, mostly in the Russian and
Belfast varieties, will be favorites for
outing, and they are to be trimmed
with the heavy Russian lace otf a little
Bulgarian embroidery judiciously ap
piled. Java and Panama linen, mostly
in natural colors, are also much sought
for Just now.

world In 1M4. For- more t4- an eeu
tury they had traveled to Europe and
ignored the wonderful, beautiful trop
ical islands lying at their feet. The
Spanish-Americalin war .illed their at
tention to these Islands, and now a few
of them are beginning to spend on their
own side of the world some of the mon
ey they have gained in the United
States instead of rushing off to scatter
it in Europe.
The tide of winter travel has this
season set more strongly than ever be
fore toward the West Ildies. This old
town of Nassau appears to be attract
ing many Yankee tourists who seek to
escape the trying cold of their own cli
mate. No doubt the well organized
American has such control over him
self that the rigors of the United States
winter climate simply serve to brace him
up, but for people who are so far from
well organized that very cold weather
fairly draws themn up double and sends
them, shivering, through the year from
December first till .Ma1rcll last no spot
of earth is more delightful than Nas
sau. In Europe it has been noted for
generations because of its benefit to
consumptive luvalids. The climate is
ideal almost. In Porto IRico, our new
West Indian possession, the American
swelters with the fielting heat in Jan
uary. That heat is moist and sticky,
like the climate of Manila. Here in
the benutiful Bahamas the hirh ltem
perature is not so trying. Besides, the
Iphamas have not ;lany mosquitoes.
Nassau is about 600('miles north of
the northern point of Porto Itco, which
makes the Nassau climate cooler. It is
one of the most accessible points from
the States. This island of New Provi
dence is only one night's sail from
Palm Beach. Fla. It is a favorite trip.
From New York by steamer the jour
ney requires three days. The tour
ist parties now planned from the
States bring these lovely tropical is
lands within reach of all ordinarily
well to do Americans. The usual plan
is for an itinerary to be laid out to in
elude a certain time, which may be
anywhere from one week to six. A
steamer takes the party aboard, then
sails from one seaport to another
among the West Indies, delivering
freight and passengers, stopping from
six to thirty-six hours at a port. This
gives passengers opportunity to go
ashore and sample the glories of each
island.
Several steamer lines are engaged in
this traffic, some having their route
among one set of islands, others anoth
er set. One tour will perhaps take in
the island of St. Thomas (Danish). next
ruined, hapless French Martinique;
then Grenada, Porto Rico and Cuba,
finishing with Nassau, Bahamas, be
fore returning to the States. Another
route will be laid out only to Porto
Rico and Cuba.
Four or five different nations are rep
resented in the ownership of these is
lands, yet Spanish ways and architec
tt&e are traced in all, a melancholy re
minder of the centuries when all these
waters were called the Spanish main,
because Spain was mistress of the
West Indies and of the seas.
During the trip the tourist lives upon
the ship, making excursions to points
of interest while the steamer is in the
ports.
Each Island and group of islands has
its own charm, the prolific African pre
dominating as an inhabitant in the-m
all. At Nassau one of the places to
look at is the marine garden, !a lai
scape under the sea. You are conv.-yed
