The Cotton Valley Disaster.
Decision Rendetred by the United
States Local Inspectors-It is
unfalivoralble to tli( ()ilicers (,i'
the Vessl-the Licensces
of C('apt. M31. 11. Kouns t
and Mate \V. A. t
l)uke Revoked.
The following decision on the Cot
ton Valley disaster was rendered
1Wednesday morning by the Local 1
Inspectors :
OFF'iCE U. S. loARI) OF1" LOCAL )
Inspectors of Steatm Vessels. r
New Orleans, La., Dec., 18, 1878. c
Decision in the case of collission t
between the steamers Cotton Valley I
and Charles Morgan. t
We\\' have carefully studied tihe tes
tiumony given in the case, and find J
the Cotton Valley ascending and the I
Charles Morgan descending the river c
on the morning of the 1st inst., at
about 4 o'clock, it being very dark, i
the wind blowing hard and raining I
heavy, at a place about two miles o
below Donaldsonville, near Bringier's u
Point, where a collision occurred, u
whereby the Cotton Valley was sunk P
and three lives lost. We find the
Charles Morgan in her proper place n
in the river for a descending steanmei,
fully officered as the law requites, c
both pilots in the pilot-house at the f
timie, as also the captain, where le J
had gone to keep out of the hard c
rain then falling, the first mate on a
watch and at his post; the steamer ii
backing before and at the time of the I1
collision, and everything done by ii
her officers to avoid a collision, and c
afterwards to rescue the people of t
the ill-fated steamer. We find that a
the Cotton Valley was not in her a
proper place for an ascending steam- a
er, that her captain had not been on n
watch since 11 o'clock of the night of ,
the collission; that her first mate c
Ihad not len on watch silnce inmine- C
diately after leaving this city till
about 4 o'clock in the morning of the v
collision-lhotl of which we deem fi
gross neglect of duty, especially on i
such a night. c
Mr. Swain, the pilot on watch'on i
the Cotton Valley, was evidently mis- y
taken in his position in the liuer, as i
lie testimony shows that the collison a
occurred in or near the iniddle of the
river. When he stood out to turn t
tliinger's Point (which was a star- 1
board point), the night being very y
dark and the wind blowing off the:l
starboard shore, he missed his calcu- "
lation and we find hiim out of his t
place. We\V also lind that the Cotton v
'Valle's engines were not stopped a.
until her bow had passed aeross the it
how of the Charles Morgan, nor were i f
they backed at all.
\yWe believe that if either the cap- I
lain or the first imate of the Cotton t
Valley had been on watch and at his c
post the collision would not have t
occurred. i
We see no evidence on the part of: t
the oticers of the Cotton Valley ,
where the licensed officers did any
thing to save to the lives of the cab- i c
in on deck passeugers, either through ,
s5pplving Ihem with life-preservers r
or e% in suggesting their use, and es- t
it ciallyv was one poor unfortunate la
dly allowed to drown with only a
simple invitation to jump overboard,
whereas, had she a life-presertver on, c
she would douibtless have floated un
til she could have been rescued by
the yawl of the Chans. Morgan. t
The act of Capt. Konuz, ir allow
ing only his wife and two children
and Mrs. Sandford in a life-boat that
was calpable of carrying fifteen per
sons, is reprehensible in the extreme.
Capt. Kounz is also respousible for
the dleck of his vessel being in charge i
of the second mate, an offtlicer not re
quired to be licensed, vwho was in I
charge of the deck from 6 o'clock, P. 1
M. to 4 A M., a most unusal watch.
We have therefore, this day, in I
accordance with sections 4439 and
444110 of the Revised Statutes, for in
attention to duty, revoked the li
censes of M. H. Kouns and W, A.
- Duke, respectively master and mate
Sof the ill-fited Cotton Valley, and
suspended the license of A. G. Swain,
the pilot on watch of the Cotton
Valley, for a period of thirty days
hereof, in accordance with section
4450 of the revised Statutes, for un
skillful managment, inattention to
duty, and neglect and we hereby ex
onorate the licensed officers of the
steamer Charles Morgan from all
blame.

A gentleman entered a grocery
store at North Vernon, Ind., the
other day, and asked for a gallon of
molasses. Having drawn it, the
storekeeper asked him what he would
take it home in. "In my hat,"
promptly replied the customer, calm
ly holding out a new silk hat, into
which the grocer, not to be outdone
in sangfroid, poured the fluid. Then
the customer jammed the hat on the
grocer's head and, having thus oc
cupied his attention, took what mon
ey there was in the till and depart

Miss Susan and Miss Rachel Reie

found under the bed the man for

He was hauled out and tried for go

t- number of men found under beds is
* totally disportioned to the number of

couragingthat at last he has been
efound. _ _

The Weight of a c('elton Bale. i
rThe Commissioner of Aricnulture,
Sin his r leitr, estinm ii's Ilhe c nll tlti
crop for 1178 at 5,197,0t bailes, "ial
Slowing 450 pounds as the weight of at
bale. Trhis allowance of 450 ioun ids
for a bale is calculated to lprnoduce a
Smisapprehension front the fact thatt
I thei Cotton Exchange usually esti
. mates the weiglht of a bale at 475 1
ounds, including bagging and ties. 1
In order to remove this misappre
i hlension the following dispatch was
d sent:
Hon. Win. G. LeDuc, Commission
Ser of Agriculture, Washington : Ii
Syour report do you allow 450 pounds i
n iont cotton to thie bale, or do youl 1
mean 450 pounds per baleo gross, that
is including bagging and ties / It is
- construed both ways here.
SiENRY G, hESTER,
i Secretary Cotton Exchange.
The following reply was received:
Washington, Dec. 13.-Htenry G
Hester, Secretary, etc.; We mean 450
pounds of cotton o to hie bale, not tak
ing into consideration the bagging
and ties.
W~i. G. LoDuc,

. Turkish families lately returned to
o the, Bulgarian village of Soutlar.
e Having been robbed of their cattle by
the way, they reached their old homes
c- utterly destitute. Since their return
- several of their number have been
Skilled; the others have hbeen set by
the Bulgarians to make bricks, andt
their employers place overseers over

o Another. batch of refugees atirived at

0- ise that the half of the crops which
le they had sworn before thleir flight,
is but which the Bulgarians, in their ab
tf sence, had harvested, would be o
I turned to them. On t(bw arrival,
in however, their cattle were taken fronm
them, and the promised half of their
crops were refused. They were,
as therefore, obliged to hire themselves
. :to the Bulgars as hewers of wood
t- and drawers of water-labor for
' which the Balgara paid them with
their own grain.
