with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
beat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose

Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impurities bursting
through tho skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you find it ob

it when it is foul ; your feelings will tell
von when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
