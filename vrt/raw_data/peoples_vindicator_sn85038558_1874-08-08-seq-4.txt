Every year increases the populari
ty of this valuable Hair Preparation;
which is due to merit alone. We
can assure our old patrons that it is
kept fully pp to its high standard;
and it is the only reliable and perfect
ed preparation for restoring G rA
OR FADED HAIR to its youthful color,
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white
and clean. It removes all eruptions
and dandrufi; and, by its tonic prop
erties, prevents the hair from falling
out, as it stimulates. and nourishes
the hair-glands. By its use, the hair
grows thicker and stronger.v In
baldness, it restores the capillary
glands to their normal vigor, and
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old age. It is the most eco
nomical Hat DBEssING ever used,
as it requires fewer applications,
and gives the hair a splendid, glossy
appearance.A A. A. Hayes, M.D,
State Assayer ofMas achusetts, says,
