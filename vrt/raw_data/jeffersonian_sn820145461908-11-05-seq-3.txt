A Little Strategist—A True Incident
By Annie Hamilton Donnell
Dunean sat for a moment appar
ently still, but he was not still in
side. A riot of angry little thoughts
raced through his brain, and it
seemed to Dunean that they stamped
as they ran, for they hurt. He did
not look toward the White Figure
mending things in the window. The
White Figure did not look at him.
It was a very long moment. The
next and the next were just as long.
The tramping feet of the angry
thoughts seemed to grow hot —the
thoughts themselves sizzled as if Dun
ean were frying them. The Thought
at the Head shouted repeatedly:
“I’m not sorry a tall!”
“He must be sorry!” persisted the
thoughts of the gentle White Figure.
She steeled herself not to retract her
ultimatum; she had need to steel her
self. The small person perched high
in the Place of Woes was her own
small son whom she loved. She felt
the jar of the tramping, hot-footed
little thoughts; she loved them, too.
“He must repent!—l told him,”
she repeated. She seemed suddenly
to possess a dual personality—to be
the Mother Who Loved and the
Mother Who Punished. They faced
each other in open dispute. Like
the Thoughts in the boy’s tumul
tuous little brain, they hurt.
“He is so little!” the Mother Who
Loved cried.
“He disobeyed—he must be sor
ry!” replied the Mother Who Pun
ished.
“I never punished him as hard as
this before —to make him sit still!”
“He cannot —get down —till he—
is sorry!”
On the high couch the dangling lit
tle feet began to swing and thump
with racking monotony. The boy had
stopped sitting still. He essayed to
whistle an accompaniment to his feet.
The Mother Who Loved loved the
awful little whistle.
“Duncan, keep still!” commanded
sternly the other Mother. But it was
like stemming the tides of the sea.
He began to sing in a soft, not un
musical, little mutter:
r
“Mothers is nau-tee.
Mothers is bad.
This one’s the baddes’
’T ever —I—had.”
The White Figure in the window
shook with internal struggle. She
seemed to be pushing back someone.
“Let me be! I’m going to him—
I tell you I’m going to take him in
my arms and hug him! He is mine,
I tell you!”
“He is mine, too.” The Mother
Who Punished was calm, resistant.
She, too, was proud of the funny lit
tle verse, but she turned her back up
on the poet. She would not look his
way at all. She looked down at the
mending in her lap—it was a tiny,
kneeless stocking. She looked out of
the window —at little swaying clothes
on the line, a little shirt, a blouse, a
little nightgown waving empty arms.
The boy was everywhere; she could
not get away from him. His short
spade stuck up slant-wise from a
heap of sand. His cart lopped on
three wheels in a corner. His drum,
his flag, his stuffed elephant, intruded
on her vision. <She might as well
turn back to the child himself.
“Kitty, I’m glad you’ve came” —
so the little thud she had heard
meant that? Mother Who Punished
as she was, she was glad the cat had
come for comforting— 11 ’Cause it
feels lonesomely up here. You can
purr all you min’ to, kitty”—she
knew his little, tender hand was
stroking, stroking, and she was en
vious. ‘‘l don’t feel purry a tall.
I’m bein’ punished, but I’m not sor
ry. I’ve got to live up here all o’
my life an’ you’ll have to bring me
mouses to eat.” His shudder and
hers seemed to meet and rock the
room gently in their throes. “I’ve
never ate ’em, kitty; you sure they’re
good? I’d ruther eat a wishbone. I
was a-goin’ to at supper —once.”
The wistfulness of his little voice was
too much for her, and suddenly there
were two Mothers Who Loved. They
clung to each other for strength to
resist the wistfulness. Fortunately it
effervesced in a long sigh and the
new tone was easier to bear.
“Kitty, don’t you never—you lis
ten io me! —never set your little cat
childrens up on sofas to be punished!
Don’t you never say: 4 Sit there till
you’re sorry!’ You lick ’em, kitty,
with your tongue an’ love ’em. I’d
be ’shamed o’ you for punishing
’em! ”
The moments that had dragged
themselves into eternity were few in
number but terrible in length. A
faint bell tolled somewhere at a dis
tance.
“I guess that’s a supper-bell, kit
ty. Some’dy’s a-goin’ to eat things.
I —l don’t know but you better get
a mouse, only —only I’d ruther you’d
roast it. I s’pose I could eat a roast
mouse, ’thout chewing. Kitty”—in
a carefully raised voice—“you may
have all o’ my bones when I’m
starved. But I guess—l guess I’d
ruther you wouldn’t crunch ’em.”
“This is awful!” groaned the
Mother Who Loved, sweating, it
seemed, drops of love. She turned
sharply. Now he would be in mood
for repentance.
“Is my little boy sorry?” she
asked very gently.
The figure in the Place of Woes
stiffened visibly. iShe could see his
little stubbornness oozing from ev
ery pore. And she had been proud
of his firmness of will —oh, she was
proud of it now! She could look
ahead —a long and difficult way—in
to the future, and see its moral and
merchantable value to this little son
who would not be sorry. But he must
be sorry!
“Kitty, don’t you never ask, ‘ls
my little boy sorry?’ to your cat
childrens ! It will make ’em cross,
kitty. You ask ’em: ‘Don’t my lit
tle boy feel like gettin’ down now?’
An’ they’ll feel like it,” added sigh
ingly the stubborn little voice.
Things went on generally as if no
one was being punished. Birds out
side sang just the same and as cheer-
Jeffersonian
fully; hucksters going by shouted
their wares; unpunished little boys
played as noisily on the sidewalk—
mothers in the windows mended little
knees. The clock was the only thing
that talked, for what seemed a long
time, in one particular room. On the
high sofa a course of elaborate reas
oning was going on. It plowed phil
osophers’ furrows in the smooth brow
■of the reasoner. The big cat, stroked
continuously by a kind little hand,
lay perfectly still, as though realiz
ing that any sudden motion might in
terrupt important processes of
thought.
Suddenly the small philosopher
straightened with the air of having
arrived at a definite conclusion. Some
thing like a premonition of triumph
lurked behind the innocent blue cur
tains of his eyes. He coughed softly
in a preparatory way. The eat
pricked up its ears.
“Mamma”—the voice was honey
sweet, startling the White Figure out
of its troubled revery —“Mamma, you
said the Lord answered folkses’ pray
ers, didn’t you?”
The relief in the gentle face merged
slowly into a puzzled expression. The
religious mood that prompted the
query failed altogether to comfort the
Mother Who Loved. “She was even a
little apprehensive.
“You said so, didn’t you, mam
ma?”
“Yes, Dunean—why, yes, of
course. ’ ’
“Allerways. does He?” Duncan
was softly insistent. His small, puck
ered face expressed—was it need of
divine assistance to be sorry? It
would seem so —on the outer side of
the blue curtains. The Mother Who
Loved took courage.
“The Bible says that he who asks
shall receive—if he asks right,” she
added, as a measure of precaution.
“Yessum —asks right. Mamma, I
want to say my prayers.”
She moved a little and the arms of
her heart shot out to gather him in;
he always prayed at her knee. But
again she was strong.
“Yes —yes, dear. You can say
them right there. Mamma will stop
sewing and shut her eyes, too.”
Indignation stalked forth from be
hind the blue curtains and gazed at
her to her discomfiture.
‘ ‘ ’Thout I kneel down on my
knees!” ejaculated Duncan. Injury
succeeded indignation. His reproach
reached across the room. It was nec
essary to consider the next step care
fully. The face of the Mother Who
Loved was thoughtful.
“Well, you may kneel down, dear
—there at the sofa. Shall mamma
shut her eyes now?” >
“Yessum—ow shut ’em.”
There was silence so unexpectedly
long a time that the mother’s eyes
unclosed in surprise. The little kneel
ing figure drew her like a magnet.
The “kissing-ground” under the
square-cut fringe of rough hair lay,
a little strip of soft white neck, tan
talizing her. She could feel the
sweet taste of it on her lips.
Now—now he would be sorry! She
would have him again ndw. But why
did he pray so long? A suspicion
crossed her mind that the little trans
gressor might have fallen asleep, and
instinctively she got on her feet to
go to him—the little blessed, her lit
tle blessed!
‘ ‘ A —men! ’ ’ enunciated Duncan,
suddenly with fervor. Hs warm,
flushed face turned toward her. He
was just then altogether irresistible.
“Duncan—dear little boy—” she
began, but he was before her. Tri
umph exuded from all his little pores
as he trapped across to her. She
waited, smiling in her relief, for him
to say at last, “I’m sorry.”
“I prayed to stay down off o’ the
sofa,” was what Duncan said.

the Mother Who Loved should have
done? —The Mothers’ Magazine.
THE THOMASVILLE MEETING.
The meeting in Thomasville on the
22nd inst. was the greatest gathering
of a political nature the town has
witnessed in many years. Over two
thousand people heard Mr. Watson’s
powerful address, and it was easy to
see that a big majority of the crowd
was with the speaker from the begin
ning, but probably the most gratify
ing feature of the occasion was the
number of new converts made by
Mr. Watson’s fierce arraignment of
the two old parties and the clear
statement of the cause which he rep
resents. Dozens of voters who had
previously been always ready with an
abusive word for Mr. Watson and
Populism, came away from the speak
ing vowing their intention to vote
the Southern white man’s ticket in
this race.
Populism has some strong friends
in Thomas county who have never
for a moment flagged in their enthu
siasm, and the old middle-of-the-road
ers turned out en masse. Mr. Wat
son, too, has hundreds of strong
friends and admirers, personally, who
heretofore have not gone far enough -
to vote with him, yet they were glad
to turn out and welcome him on this
occasion, and as stated above, num
bers of them have already come the
whole distance and acknowledged
that they cannot longer stand the
attacks of Mr. Watson’s powerful
logic.
The reception tendered Mr. Wat
son by the people of the town and
county was indicative of his popu
larity. He was met at the depot by
the Mayor of Thomasville, Judge J.
S. Montgomery, President C. S. Par
ker of the Board of Trade, and Sec
retary W. M. Parker of the Board of
Trade. Besides the gentlemen men
tioned, Mr. Watson was accompanied
to Paradise Park, where the speak
ing took place, by County Chairman
G. C. Lunsford and R. L. Braswell,
member of the state campaign com
mittee for the second congressional
district. He was introduced by Hon.
S. 4. Roddenbery.
Mr. Watson will receive more votes
in Thomas county on November 3
than ever polled by any Populist
candidate before in the history of the
county.
