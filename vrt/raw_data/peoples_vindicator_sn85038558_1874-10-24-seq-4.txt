as one of the most

which arise from malarious, marsh, or

No one remedy is louder
called for by the necessities
of the American people than
a sure and safe cure for
Fever and Ague. Such
we are now enabled to offer,
with a perfect certainty that
it will eradicate the disease, and with assur
ance, founded on proof, that.ho harm can
arise fromo its use in any quantity.
6rhat which protects from or prevents this
disorder must be of immense service in the
communnities where it prevails. Prevention
is better than cure; for the patient escapes the
risk which he nmust run in violent attacks of
this baleful distenlper. This " Cumin" expels
tihe mniasmiatic poison of 'cever and Ague
from the system, and prevents the develpp
mont of the disease, if taken on the first
approach of its prcnmonitory symptoms. A
great superiority of this remedy over any
other ever discovered for the speedy and cer
tain cure of Intermnittents is, that it contains
no Quinine or mineral; consequenitly it pro
duces no quinismn or other injurious effects
whatevernpon the constitution. Those cured
by it are left as healthy as if they had never
hadl thie disease.
Fever astl Angoe i.s not alone the con.
sequence of the minmaultic poison. A great
variety of disorders arise firom its irritation,
among which are 1cumrlgla, lhetusma.,

Toothache, Earache,Catarrb, Assth

ment of the Stomach, all of which, w-hen
originating in this cause, put on the intter
mittent type, or become periodical. This
"CURE" expels the poison roma the blood,
and consequently cures them all alike. It Is
'dn invaluable protection to immigtants sand
persons travelling or temporarily residing in
the malarious districts. If taken occasion
ally or daily while exposed to tile infection,
that will be excreted from the system, and
cannot accumulate in senmfllcient quantity to
ripen into disease. Hence it is even more
valuable for protection than cnre; and few
will ever lsuffer from Intermittents if they
avail themselves of the protection this rem
edy aftords.
For Liver Complaints, arising from torpid.
Ity of the Liver, it is an excellent remedy,
stimulating the Liver into healthy activity,
and producing many truly remarkable cures,
where other medicines fhil.
