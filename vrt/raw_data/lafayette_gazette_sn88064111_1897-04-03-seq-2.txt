THIE ISSUE IS CL-EAR.
When the present City Council
took charge of the municipal affairs co
of this town the condition of things SO
w:hich then prevailed was nut at all _
satisfactory,"but two years of. wise
and judicious administration have
brought about a decided change. tr
When the preceding Council went
out of office, there was not enough
money in the treasury to pay out
standing debts and the corporation me
was indebted to a number of citi- Cal
zens. These debts were paid by
the present Council, despite the
fact that the revenues during the V
first year of its incumbency were
curtailed neatly one half owing to the
decision of the Supreme Court
which prevented the collection of
taxes from the "additions." By
this decision the town was deprived Si
of nearly half its revenues. But
the "additions" were soon re-incor
porated and it required the same
amount to run the town although
the money collected was far from
being what it was the year before.
We repeat that the Council was
handicapped by this large decrease su
in the revenues of the town; never- of
theless old debts contracted and al
left unpaid by the preceding Coun- h
clI were liquidated and all
new obligations were met in it
regular order. The financial af
fairs of the corporation have been
administered in a straight, bus~ness
like manner. The proceedings of -
the council published monthly
never failed to show how every
cent collected had been spent, or if J;
not expended, where it was. This
part of the people's business has
been particularly well attended to.
These are facts, cold, stubborn
facts. The books are there to
prove their correctness. The town i
has been as well lighted as ever be- al
fore; the police has been equally as h
good; the streets are in splendid h
condition; the town owes no one,
and there is a surplus in the
treasury of over $2zoo without ii
counting the amount raised by the ,
collection of the special tax--the tl
last report of the treasurer shows
$16oo to the credit of the latter fund. V
How was it under the former
Council, when the men who want to
get into power, were at the helm?
Without wishing to be unneces
sarily severe, we are compelled to
say that the finances of the town
were in very bad shape. Will any
supporter of the People's ticket
gainsay this? Is it not a fact that
there was a shortage of some seven
hundred dollars, the result of loose
management of the public funds?
There is no use getting excited
about this thing. The issue is
clear. It is whether we are going
to have a continuance of good mu
nicipal government or a return to'
the old order of things.
The success of the Democratic
ticket headed by Mr. Charles D.
Caffery means an intelligent, busi
ness-like administration such as we
have been having under the present
Council.
