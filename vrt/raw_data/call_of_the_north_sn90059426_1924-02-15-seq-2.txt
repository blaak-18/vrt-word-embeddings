MENACE OF THE MOVIES
Three years ago, and you will re
member it, I told you people that the
cause of this moral depression over
America was due to the movies and
had no connection with the war, to
which it has been attributed by many.
Today the American people are be
ginning to learn the source of the
present day degeneracy.
The school of the movie is solely
and absolutely responsible for the evil
that saturated the social life of the
day.
I told you three years ago where
the source of infection was and beg
ged for an operation, and you laughed.
Today, students of social conditions
are beginning to realize that I was
right, and measures are being grad
ually taken to remedy the evil.
Ohio and Pennsylvania are the only
states in the Union that have censor
boards that censor. The one in Texas
is a joke, a positive joke. Any pic
ture on earth can get by in Texas.
It is a pitiable fact. I have seen
them show “Creation,” wherein nak
ed women disported vulgarly under
the hypocritical and disgusting pro
tection of an alleged Biblical story.
The worst type of sex stories are un
folded to the children of this state,
under the protection of censor boards.
Ohio and Pennsylvania have taken
the lead in the matter of censorship.
“Broad minded” censors who see in
vulgarity a touch of progress, have
no place in those two states.
I tell you that not three per cent of
the pictures made in Hollywood are
fit to be shown to the children of this
nation.

hero and the prostitution of a young

THE ONE AMEI
One of the great responsibilities
and problems of the superintendent
of schools is to make his supervision
of his teaching force effective, agree
able, and wise. If the quality of the
instruction is to be improved, there
must be earnest efforts at careful
supervision l . Teachers are trained by
constructive supervision in just as
true a sense as they are trained by
normal school instruction. Supervi
sion is necessary to promote unity of
purpose and co-operation, to help in
experienced teachers to master their
work more quickly, to stimulate the
more experienced teachers to keep up
with the best work being done edu
cationally.
The attitude of the teacher toward
supervision is of particular impor
tance. No sustem of supervision will
function unless the attitude of the
classroom teacher is one of willing
co-operation. The teacher who thinks
supervision unnecessary or who re
sents it has not seen it in its true
light.
In the past supervision has been
too often chiefly inspections!, fault
finding and mechanical in character.
It is still frequently too arbitrary
and misses its great opportunity for
constructive leadership. The chief
VAST TASK IN GREECE
Of all the sore spots of Europe
there is none that can be more readily
healed, without political interference
of any sort, by the saving hand of the
American people, than Greece. Hav.
ing suffered a collapse of her dreams
of territorial expansion, Greece finds
herself called upon to absorb a sud
den increase of population unprece
dented since the days of the Argon
migrations. The Greeks are handl
ing this situation to the utmost of
their ability and their means. The
American people have rendered, and
are rendering, effective help, and
now your Henry Morgenthau has gone
to Greece to act as chairman of the
commission that shall find these re
fugees new homes and speed them on
the way to selfsupport.
In their unfortunate military ad
venture the Greeks attempted to go
over to their kinsmen in Asia Minor,
to answer the call of the descendants
of the Greek colonists of three thou
sand years ago who were tenants of
the farmers of the near east long
centuries before the Turkish con
querors arrived. Orthodox Christians,
they had learned to speak the Tur
kish tongue, but they had resisted the
Moslem religion. In their attempt to
include these kinsmen in a greater
Greece, the Greek armies failed utter
ly. In their retreat they precipitated
instead an action threatened for cen
turies, the evacuation en masse of the

belled.
Little children in those states will
not be raised on the theory that viola
tion of the moral code is but a venial
fault; little children, in those states,
will not be taught the roses and rap
tures of vice, in their character form
ing and impressionable years, as is
daily done in Texas.
The pictures of today defy the
priesthood and dam the Protestant
religion.
They are chock a block with propa
ganda calculated to destroy the sanc
tity of the home. Such plays as “Vir
tuous Wives,” “The Wife’s Secret,”
“His Neighbor’s Wife,” “Foolish
Wives,” and kindred plays all glori
fy the joys of broken marital vows.
One Hollywood magazine refers to the
marriage license as “an old-fashioned
document.” All that propaganda is
continually emanating from screen
headquarters. Old Satan himself,
were he the reigning czar of Holly
wood, instead of an assistant, couldn’t
design more soul destroying propa
ganda than is daily coming out of that
great cancer on American life, with
approval of every censor board in
America save those of Ohio and
Pennsylvania.
No man can forever revel in the
salacious and debauching propaganda
of the screen without absorbing some
of its evil influences.
When every state in the Union
forces on the screen clean pictures by
clean actors then will the step up
ward be taken, and not until then;
when every state in the Union bars
such drabs as Mabel Normand and
Edna Purviance, and all actresses
who are known to visit men alone in
their apartments, who figure in
drunken orgies and killing scrapes,
then another step forward and up
ward will have been taken.

function of the supervisor is to give
directions and to see that they are
minutely carried out. The supervisor
should, first of all, be a leader
charged with the organization of the
teaching staff for the study of pro
fessional problems.
Teaching can never be a real pro
fession until both the teacher and
supervisor view this question from
an impersonal standpoint. Women,
often more than men, are too fre
quently inclined to be personal in
their viewpoints. The success of
those engaged in school administra
tion can be measured by their ability
to view their responsibilities imper
sonally.
The Southwestern Teachers’ associ
ation sums it up well in this recent
resolution: “The highest degree of
efficiency of our schools demands not
only skilful teachers, but also well
trained, expert supervisors. For this
reason, we deplore the tendency in
some quarters to reduce the amount
of supervision wholly inadequate and
perfunctory. We believe that skillful
supervision of public funds, and that
a wiser policy would be to insist up
on a better quality of supervision
rather than its abolition.”—Exchange.

Greek population and their flight by
hundreds of thousands across the Ae
gean to the old home of Hellas. Greece
utterly exhausted after 10 years of
war and numbering only four and a
half million inhabitants, now finds
more than a million of these fugitives
within her newly compressed borders,
imagine the problem which would be
facing your United States, large and
prosperous as you are, if you sudden
ly found yourselves, in a single year,
confronted with an immigration of
twenty-five to thirty million people,
four-fifths of whom were completely
dependent on charity!
Refugees are still arriving from
Asia Minor. Vast numbers remain tc
be dealt with. If the reconstructive
scheme of the loan, supported as it
must be by charitable relief, does not
succeed, the catastrophe which was
averted a year ago will shortly take
place. In that case Greece will be
thrown into a financial and economic
chaos which will inveitably cause dis
turbances in Greece and also en the
Balkan peninsula. It should be re
membered that all recent wars in
Europe started on the Balkan penin
sula. There is, therefore, every rea
son to wish that this source of danger
be removed. If the catastrophe is
averted by the reconstructive efforts
which have been described, Greece will
regain her place among the leaders
of the civilization of southern Europe.

Charleston, W. Va. I could stop
cigaret smoking in West Virginia, I
would consider it the greatest thing I
could do for my state,” Gov. E. F.
Morgan declared recently in a state
ment issued from his office comment
ing on the suicide of Miss Margaret
Harding in Boston.
The governor referred to a state
ment by the girl’s father which -at
tributed to cigaret smoking, as well
as other things, a nervous breakdown
that preceded the shooting.
“I think Mr. Harding’s admission
over the cause of his daughter’s death
was very courageous,” Gov. Morgan
said, “and I think he made it for the
purpose of warning others against
the habits referred to.
“Cigaret smoking among women is
becoming alarming and I think it is
time the women’s clubs took an active
part in a campaign to stop the prac
tice.”
Speaking of his wish that cigaret
smoking could be stopped in the state
the governor pointed out he recom
mended bills to the last legislature
that would forbid smoking cigarets in
public buildings, but these were not
passed.
“You cannot {.legislate morals into
people,” he added, “you’ve got to
preach it into them. That’s why I
think the women’s clubs should take
up the fight.”

KLAN AND THE NEGRO
Never, in the history of the Klan,
has a single word been written or
uttered which might be considered as
objectionable to any thinking negro,
and the negro leaders of today know
it and are admitting it. Negro even
gelists, negro editors and thinking
negro laymen realize that the Klan is
the champion of the public school,
which is the very heart and soul of
the negro’s advancement. They also
know that in Texas and elsewhere in
the South, the Klan has been the pro
tector of virtuous negro womanhood
as well as that of the white woman.
One of the tenets of the creed of the
Klan is prevention of the cause of
mob violence and lynching. How bet
ter could this be carried out than by
education of both races against in
termingling white and black blood?
The white man of lustful habits has
been taught that virtue, whether it
is that of the black race or the white.
And while we are on the subject, we
might say that we wonder what the
Catholics are going to do with their
white and black priests so far as their
admission to convents and nunneries
is concerned. And what kind of par
ochial schools are they going to pro
vide for the millions of little picka
ninnies who will soon be voting citi
zens ?—Mayfield’s Weekly.

The Kjul Klux
Oath
Some newspapers are still harping
on the oath of the Ku Klux Klan.
It has been pictured as a blood
curdling oath, contrary to the Ameri
can government and against all man
kind. That’s a huge joke to any man
or woman who has taken that Ameri
can-bound oath. Taken “fore and aft”
it is only those with foreign thoughts
and allegiances who cannot take the
Kluckers’ oath of allegiance to this
government and its flag. That’s the
oath of a real HE or SHE American.
Those influences and organizations
foreign to the United States have
been “picking” us off one at a time
for so long that they are highly in
censed that the American patriots
have resolved to “run their own busi
ness” ’for a while. American sons
and daughters own this country by
right of inheritance, and we have de
cided to keep our own books hereafter,
so to speak. For the past forty years
the “bookkepping” has been done at
Rome and now that the “bookkeeper”
has been fired and a new one selected
on this side of the pond who can and
does speak English the old outfit is
mad, and are trying to oust the new
‘hand.’
Yes, you tell ’em a change in book
keeping has taken place and no new
change is expected any time soon, at
least so long as the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan live and that’s going to be
somewhat lengthy.—Oklahoma Fiery

OREGON’S EXAMPLE
WILL BE FOLLOWED
Seattle, Wash.—Responsibility for
the initiative bill filed this week at
Olympia, aimed against parochial
and other schools, will be assumed
by the Ku Klux Klan cabinet, John
A. Jeffries, Klan lecturer of the realm
of Washington, declares.
Jeffries also declared that the five
Tacoma men who presented the
measure were members of the board
of directors of the Good Government
League, incorporated December 29,
1923, and that the league is an out
growth of the Klan.
“I have not seen the bill yet, but,
if, as I understand, it provides for
approximately the same law adopted
in Oregon, we (the Klan) will be be
hind it,” asserted Jeffries. “The bill
will be considered formally by the
members of the Klan and another
order, which also favors the school
bill.
“The Knights of the Invisible Em
pire now have sufficient strength in
Washington to provide from its mem
bership more than the required 50,000
signers needed to place the bill on
the ballot for the general election
November 4.
“If the measure is adopted by
Washington it will be the first state
in the union to put such a law into ef
fect owing to the fact that it would
become effective in September, 1925,
as the measure adopted by Oregon
does not become effective until Sep
tember, 1926.”
DOES IT OR DOESN’T IT?
Peoria, HL—Oan you beat it? A
Peoria citizen is to be tried for mur
der and yesterday the selection of a
jury to try the case was taking place.
Two gentlemen were selected and
passed for the service the day before
but the defense attorneys asked the
following day that these two men be
removed from the jury. The judge
was loathe to allow them removed
and required that if they wished them
removed that it be done so by
premptory challenge. The challenge
was thus made and the men removed.
And now comes, out the Peoria Star
of that evening with the following
statement: “Premptory challenges
were used this morning by the de
fense against L. E. Wilson, 135 High
street and William Johnson, Sr.
Both sides accepted them previously.
It was rumored in the court room
that the men belonged to a secret
order which is supposed to stand for
law enforcement."
Ye gods and little fishes! To be
long to an organization that stands
for law enforcement disqualifies a
man for jury service. Then who shall
try our criminals? Obviously in law
enforcement or at least their pre
judices as to law enforcement must
not be known to the attorneys for the
defense. Is it not time for our red
blooded Americans to awaken to the
lownis'hness of our courts and to de
mand that those who believe in up
holding the law shall be the ones to
determine the guilt or innocence of
those on trial ? Because a man be
lieves in law enforcement does not
preclude the possibility of the inno
cence of the prisoner.
The high ideals of law have de
teriorated until a trial is not of the
guilt or innocence of the one on trial
but rather to a test of ability of
the attorneys to prevent the statutes
and evidence and make them so en
tangled that a jury is baffled and
tricked into unfair decisions. How
long must these things endure?
When shall right come from off the
scaffold and begin the millennial year
upon the throne?

EDITOR DECLARES
KLAN DESTINED TO
REDEEM COUNTRY
Harrodsburg, Ky.—The editor of
the Harrodsburg Democrat, publish
ed here, again has come out with an
editorial extolling the virtues of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. It
must be remembered that he is a not
a member of the organization, but
has been one of the most militant
powers supporting the organization
in this city and county.
His latest editorial is on “Law
and Order.”
After telling of some of the
causes why laws are disregarded in
the present day, he takes parents to
task for the gradual disappearance
of home life in this country. He says
the child, early in life, gets accus
tomed to doing as he pleases, with
out regard to the rights of others
and this fact is largely due to the
parent, the father working all day
and half the night in a mad desire for
money and the mother spending her
waking hours discharging her social
duties. He says modern court pro
ceedings too often are farces and
the delays permitted in' criminal lit
igation too often result in the ac
quittal of guilty persons.
His reference to the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan is as follows:
“We often have thought that in
the hour of national stress, emer
gency and crisis, the Divine Ruler of
the universe often raises up some
one or some agency capable of coun
teracting whatever may tend to un
dermine the good that is in a nation
or jeopardize its forward march
along the path of what is right and
progressive, and in this connection
we are bound to say that such agen
cies are at work in this land at the
present day. We have our churches,
our patriotic institutions and men of
force with the courage of their opin
ions, and the battle is not lost by any
means. We have also, in these lat
ter days, a great movement, now
claiming millions of the best citizens
of this country, that in our opinion
is destined to make its mark on the
history and life of the nation, and
that is even now sowing the seed that
will, in time, bring forth a harvest
of patriotic men and women and
bring about a rejuvenated country
along the line of law and order. We
refer to the Ku Klux Klan organiza
tion —a name that is even now a
watchword or national import and of
national significance. We wish it
well and a rich guerdon in the re
clamation of this great land from
the slough of disorder and lawless
ness. And we shall continue to live
in hope, disdaining pessimism and
cynicism from which, happily, the
kind editor of the Louiville Post has
recently exonerated us.”

IN OREGON SCHOOLS
Broadbent, Oregon.—By order of
the school directors in this district,
the Bible was read in our school for
the first time on Wednesday and the

WASHINGTON NOTES
Bureau of Publication and Education.
Washington, D. C. —The flags on
the White House, on the United States
Capitol, on all government buildings
in this city are drooping at half mast
today and will continue so for a per
iod of thirty days, while the nation
mourns the passing of former Presi
dent Woodrow Wilson. President
Coolidge proclaimed that the highest
honors that can be paid shall be ac
corded the country’s war chieftan.
At the Capitol building itself, the
sounds of conflict and bitter partisan
strife that have marked recent weeks
were stilled. Both houses of Congress
met at noon and adjourned in a few
minutes out of respect to Mr. Wilson’s
piemorjl but rtot until opportunity
was given for expressions of tribute
and of reverence for the man by lead
ers of both sides of the aisles that di
vide men of the two major parties.
Beautiful tributes were heard from
men who in life had opposed Mr. Wil
son and his policies with a persistence
that had its root in profound dislike
and distrust. But death itself levels
all such barriers and acclaim was paid
to him today as generously as it may
have been denied to him in the past.
And the one who has entered his last
ong sleep is being cherished and laud
ed by men of all parties now as one
of the greatest presidents this coun
try has ever produced.
The Senate will not meet again un
til after President Wilson’s funeral.
The House will likewise pay its trib
ute by adjournment. On the day of
the funeral all government depart
ments will be dismissed and the day
of sorrow will be a holiday in Wash
ington so far as work is concerned.
Halts Probe of Oil Scandal
Hearings by the Senate committee
investigating the navy oil scandal
have been postponed for several days
because of the death of the former
President. But experts of the Fed
eral Trade Commission in the mean
time are examining the books of
Washington and New York brokers
at the direction of the committee.
Their object is to learn the truth of
reports that persons “on the inside”
made large sums of money speculat
ing in oil stocks at the time the naval
oil reserves were leased to Harry F.
Sinclair and Edward L. Doheny.
Harry F. Sinclair, millionaire oil
promoter and lessee of the Teapot
Dome naval reserve, is returning to
the United States at once, sailing on
Wednesday of this week, so it is an
nounced in press dispatches.
Pomerene Succeeds Gregory
Former Senator Atlee Pomerene, of
Ohio, has been named special council
to prosecute the oil cases in place of
former Attorney General Thomas H.
Gregory, of Texas, whose appointment
was withdrawn by President Coolidge
after it was learned that Gregory had
been employed as counsel by the oil
companies.
Secretary Fall Due for a Fall
The committee will seek enactment
by the Senate of a new resolution for
investigation. This is to circumvent
the objection of Albert B. Fall, former
Secretary of the Interior, that the
committee has no authority to ques
tion him because the resolution under
which it is operating was passed b>
the last Congress.
Secretary Fall will find out that he
cannot hide behind any such pretense
very long. It is simply a case of
stalling for time and he will be made
to testify and answer questions
whether it incriminates him or not.
The committee has started after him
with a vengeance which will be em
phasized from now on because of his
defiance and entire attitude. The com
mittee wants him to confess to the
world about getting SIOO,OOO in one
case and $25,000 loan in another and
the truth will be gotten out of him
even if it requires a jail sentence or
a command of the court.
Further action by the committee
will not likely take place until after
former President Wilson is buried
and Congress gets back on the job of
legislation on Capitol hill.

Seven Years Ago
Time works wonders and often it
does not take long to do it. Seven
years ago today the United States
severed diplomatic relations with Ger
many at the instance of the then
President Wilson, who now lies dead
at his quiet home in this city. This
break was followed closely by the
declaration of war in which Mr. Wil
son had his all, ruining his health for
the ideal he said, “A war to end war.”

Five Years Ago
Just five years ago today Woodrow
Wilson spoke in the French Chamber
of Deputies qt Paris the hopes and
convictions he held for the world.
Here is what he said:
“So, as we sit from day to day at
the Quai d’Orsay, I think to myself
we might, if we could gain an audi
ence of the free people of the world,
adopt the language of Gen. Pershing
and say:
“ ‘Friends, men, humble women,
little children, we are here.' We are
here as your friends, as your cham
pions, as your representatives.
“We have come to work out for
you a world which is fit to live in
and in which all countries can enjoy
the heritage of liberty for which
France and America and England and
Italy have paid ao dear.”
Not Lodge’s Keeper
Woodrow Wilson only last August
was waiting in his auto at the White
House to take his place in the Hard
ing funeral procession. An army
officer, who should have known the
former President but evidently did
not, approached Mr. Wilson and asked
him: ; ■
“Can you tell me if Senator Lodge
has arrived yet?”
President Wilson looked him cold
ly in the eye for an instant and then
realizing the innocence of the ques
tioner, replied:
“I don’t know; I’m not his keeper.”

Sees New Alien Law
Representative Samuel D. Mcßeyn
olds of Tennessee, member of the
House committee on Immigration, is
out with a statement to the effect
that “with the expiration of the pres
ent law, June 30, Congress will pass
a more stringent immigration law
than we have ever had before in this
country.”
That sentiment will meet with
hearty amen from the whole country
where red-blooded Americans live.
It’s the answer to the demand which
has come from the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan all over this nation.

Daughter of Her Father
Mrs. Alice Roosevelt Longworth
almost lives in the galleries of the
Senate and the House. She is al
ways there when big debates are on
and matters of historic import are
under way. And she enjoys it, too.
You can tell that from the way she
sits and listens. When excitement is
on and she is greatly interested, she
violates the rule of the Senate gal
leries and puts her elbows on the
railing and gets her head down in
her hands, one hand on each side of
her face. And in that position she
takes in every word that is uttered.
And she doesn’t miss a thing that is
going on that’s worth while.

To Make Big Bonfire
Uncle Sam’s wooden war fleet,
which cost $300,000,000 and was sold
for $375,000, is to be hauled up on the
shores of Virginia, not far from
Washington, to make the biggest bon
fire ever known.
This fleet of 226 wooden vessels
was purchased in the summer of 1922
by the Western Marine and Salvage
company. These dismantled hulls
were at first proposed to turn into
scows but there being no ready mar
ket for same they were towed to an
anchorage in the Potomac about 40
miles from here, there to wait their
turn in the pyre which will consume
them. More than 100 of these vessels
are now at anchorage and the burn
ing will start in about ten days, it is
reported.

Are After The Farmers
Farmers of the great Northwest
have been invited by a group of Sena
tors to get together and tell Congress
exactly what they want in the way of
relief and legislation. Nine senators
made up of Republicans, Democrats
and Farmer-Laborites have sent out
the call.
“We believe the Norris-Sinclair will
meet the situation, help the farmers
and reduce the cost of living,” said
the message. “We want your opin
ion.” Congress wants to know what
the farmers really want. Will you not
tell them.”
“We urge that meetings be held by
farmers in each precinct, not later
than Saturday, February 9. If you
are interested, get together, adopt
resolutions, sign petitions and send
them to Washington as soon as possi
ble. Let us hear from you.”
The message was signed by Sen
ators Ladd and Frazier, North Dakota;
Brookhart, Iowa; LaFollette, Wiscon
sin; and Howell, Nebraska, Republi
cans; Wheeler, Montana; and Dill, of
Washington, Democrats; and Johnson
and Shipstead, of Minnesota, Farmer-
Labor.

Klan May be a Factor
The Ku Klux Klan promises to be
a big factor in both the Republican
and Democratic national conventions
this year according to a writer in the
Washington Post who goes on to say
that the Klan may be the deciding fac
tor in the choice of a nominee in the
New York convention.
R. B. Creager, Republican national
committeeman from Texas, threatens
to bring up the subject in the Cleve
land convention by making an effort
to insert an anti-Klan plank in the
platform, but every one agrees the
gentleman from Texas will not get
very far with his notion. It is gener
ally coneeded that the Republicans
will sidestep the question and not
touch it under any circumstances but
with the Democrats it will be different.
At the New York convention it is
likely to develop into a big scrap.
Already the opponents of Mr. McAdoo
are openly asserting that he is the
candidate most favored by the Klan
and they are branding him as a Klan
candidate. On the other hand Sena
tor Underwood has come out openly
against the Klan and is making no
concealment of his attitude in his
speeches over the country. He is in
fact, making his campaign on the idea
of having his party go on record
against the “Invisible Empire.” And
this is some more politics.
