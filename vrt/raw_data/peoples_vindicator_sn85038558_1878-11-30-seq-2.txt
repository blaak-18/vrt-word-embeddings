OFFICIAL
Faper ofthe Parish and City of Natchitoches
JAI. H. COSGROVE, â€¢ Editor.
SATURDAY, -- - NOV. 30, 1e78.
To Our Bksiness Men.
We propose to issueo on the 21st Decem
ber an eight page paper as a Christmas
edfrt of the VINDICATOR ; and we will
supply beyond our circulation as many
eopies as may be desired. This contem
plated issue, will contain a terse history
of Natchitoches, its early settlement, and
personal remenicenses of citizens. Its
business, past, present and to come, with
a statement of the soil, climate and pro
dnetious of the parish, and the quantity
of cereals grown. We hope our business
men will patronize this effort liberally.
Free Government.
We are now being burdened with a
great amount of useless trumpery in
the way of idle talk. It has ever
been that the mass of mankind was
timid in the assertion of these rights
with which God has endowed them,
and which are essential to their well
being as a free people. When those
rights are menaced by a higher pow
er, society begets legions of quacks
with legions of remedies to assuage
the disease. There are, however, as
history teaches, but few doctors who
suggest a cure. The issue in Ameri
ca is certainly plain to the most un
pretending "ind. It is one of popu
lar liber .. one side and a despotic
attempt to subvert it upon the other.
The ory of a solid South is simply a
subterfuge, as slavery was. It is a
means whereby a large faction of
Americans' can -be controlled and
moved to the destruction of their
own Constitution.
Because this attempt comes in a
different form from what has been
populerly taught was the regalia tyran
ny endows itself with, but few take
alarm. Burke very properly said:
"A great deal of the furniture of an
eient tyranny is worn to rags; the
rest Is entirely out of fashion. Be
sides, there are few statesmen so very
elemsy and awkward in their busi
neas, as to fall into the identical snare
which has proved fatal to their pre
desesors. Every age has its own
manners, and its politics dependent
apon them; and the same attempts
will not be made against a Constitu.
tion fully formed and matured that
were used to destroy it in the cra
die, or to resist its growth during in
fancy."
Is any one ignorant enough to sup
pose that Radicalism, which repre.
seats supreme power other than the
people and struggles for its success,
evoald brand an attempt to subvert
the power of the people under our
Conattutiton--"alien and sedition
lawat" Yet the effort now being
arade under the crafty forms of
law is as fatal, if not summarily check
ad as any method which might be
employed, even to force.
And yet, the resistance offered to I

is well satisfied with the end reach
ed.
When corrupt men cease to foment
the ignorant and vicious to acts of
lawlessness, "outrages" in the South
will be at an end. When Southern
manhood recognizes in his political
opponent an adversary appealing to
reason for a better theory of govern
ment, and not, as it does now, a rob
ber bent on spoliation, the Bull-dozer
will be at a discount, and the White
League will disband.
Troops under Grant aggravated the
disease; Marshals under Hayes will
irritate the patient to renewed disor.
der. The mode of discarding both
treatments is for the enlightened
public sentiment of the South to de
nounce the cause, and manfully resist
the attempt to punish effect, without
removing that cause.
U. S. Marshals.
We understand that a United States
Marshal with a batch of affidavits and
warrants arrived on Wednesday even
ing, and not liking the looks of things
hereabouts, called for a hack and de
parted before night.
When the arrest of any citizen of
this parish is attempted, under a law
which the Supreme Court pronoun
ced unconstitutional, and which is
null and void, we desire to state, in
language of Governor Jackson, of
Missouri, to General Lyons, "They
will have a d-mued lively time do
ing it!"
The sovereign people of these
States are to make a stand some
where, and at some time ; this, we
conceive to be as favorable an oppor
tunity as will probably ever occur.
Our State is to be ruled in but two
ways; either the PEOPLE must do it
or the SWORD)!
We acknowledge that Mr. Hayes
and his crowd of mercenaries and
tyrants are pursuing a most insid
eons policy to destroy all civil liber
ty in this country. They are cloak
ing their efforts beneath the "forms
of law." We have warned our peo
ple against this from the very hour
we first had the honor of represent
ing their views. Let them beware
of such an effort. Charles I, Charles
II, George III, and Napoleon Bona
part are examples of those who built,
or attempted to build their own
greatness on their country's ruin,
through the "forms of law." And
let it be remembered, that the great
legal luminaries of those days, Coke,
Blacketone and Mansfield, sustained
with all their power the tyrants in their
eforts to overthrow popular liberty.
We make the assertion, that now, as
a precedent has been furnished so
marked and flagrant as the usurpa
tion of Hayes in the Presidential con
test, all the danger to our liberties
asa people lies in, the stretch of the
legal prerogatives.
Beware, Americans, of the "forms
of law !"
Text of Justice Bradley's Decision.
In the "Grant parish case," Jeustice
Bradley decided as follows, and
which decision was sustained by a
fall bench of the Supreme Court of
the United States.
That Congress has the right to pass
laws to carry out the provisions of
the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments
no one will deny. The question is,
how far this right extends.
The 13th Amendment declares that
no person in the United States shall
be disqualified from voting on ac
count of race, color or previous con
dition. The United States is given
no power to pass laws relative to
elections or voting, but simply to see
that the States do not mnterfere with
these rights. The United States-has
only the power to see these rights en
forced. The moment the State fails
to comply with the duties enforced
upon it, the United States is called on
tointerfere;-and the interference of
Congress, when the State is ready to
punish violations of these rights, is
unnecessary, injudicious and illegal.
To constitute an offense of which
the United States has jurisdiction, it
mst be shown that a conspiracy was
formed to take away certain rights
from a person cm account of his race,
color or previous condition.

prisoners "with conspiring to Ythe
certain persons of African deace
from peaceably assembling," The
Constitution of the United States de
elares that Congrees shall hot inter
fore with the right of peaceable as
eemblages.
On this point Justice Bradley said:
Does this amount to an aflirmative
law giving the United States juris
diction over all personas who shall in
terfere with the rights of peaceable
assemblages? Clearly not.
These are the main points with
which we have to contetd, and we
submit them for perusal.

Is there nothing we an do to pleAde
thaon upeslj
There is a large amount of unnec
essary talk indulged in about "Mar
shal's arrests," and "Governor's in
vestigations." Neither of these
events disturb the placidity of the
ordinary citizen. He has done noth
ing but what he considers right and
proper, and what be would do again
under like circumsances. He knows
of no authority which has the power to
arrest him, other than the Courts of
his State. He is ready there to an
swer all charges. He has no fears of
this so called "investigation." He
questions the authority for such pro
ceedings and utterly repudiates the
very idea that he is responsible to
any man or set of men, or to any au
thority, beyond the Courts of this
commonwealth, for his conduct. It
being the business of no one save
that Court, he moves on the even
tenor of his way, unterrified by the
threats of either arrest or investiga
tion.
The Senatorship.
Our contemporaries throughout the
State are casting about for a success
or to J. B. Eustis Esq., to the United
States Senate, and many favor his re
turn. If our people would pay as
much attention to home reform as
they do to the election of Congres
sional and Senatorial officials we
think Louisiana would come nearer
being redeemed. What we want is a
clean Democrat of the new and vig
orous school; some one like Moncure,
of Caddo, or Jeffries, of Rapides, in
the Senate, but we want an honest
Constitution much worse.
Let us beg the press of this State
to keep down to the "redemption of
Louisiana." When that is an accom
plished fact, then we can afford to
deal with minor subjects.
DOTS,
War in Afghan is now a fact. En
gland has invaded the Ameers do
minions.
Arrests in South Carolina and New
Orleans for violation of election laws
continue.
Sherman says he is ready to re
sume on 1st January next, as the law
requires.
Hayes has recanted the bloody
shirt, and now, since lie has got over
his mad fit, is not in favor of giving
the South h-11l.
The following from New Orleans
will be of interest to those who con
template visiting that city :
A short time before the cessation
of the epidemic here a number of
German emigrants arrived by the
steamship Frankfnl. Not one of
these emigrants had been attacked
with fever, and during the last week
those who were bound for Texas went
to Houston. Ten of the latter had
been lodging in a house where there
had been, early in the epidemic, ten
malignant cases of fever and four
deaths with black vomit, and not a
single one was taken sick. This
shows that all sporadic cases are of
those who have had the germ of fever
absorbed in their system some time
ago or relapses, and that the air is
free and has been so for over a month
from fever poison.
Albert Leonard, ex-White League
leader and founder of a Society to
kill every Radical in the State, is
whetting up his little hatchet in or
der to scalp his former friends, the
white men of North Louisiana.
The "merchants and business men
of New Orleans" are in favor of a
National quarantine which will pro
tect them in their "bRanana and orange
trade."
Baton Rouge had 2700 cases of yel
low fever, and 213 deaths; or.about
8 per cent.
Baton Rouge vs. New Orleans.
Our esteemed cotemporaries, the Ad
'ocate of Baton Rouge and the Demo
crat of New Orleans, have watched
with much interest the result of the
vote regarding the removal of the
State capital from the latter city. We
see that Natchitoches is placed, in
the compilation of the vote, in the col
umn-"For New Orleans." We sup.
pose this is done from the fact that we
voted "against let amendment." We
write this for the purpose of correct
ng what is evidently a mistake on
"the part of our New Orleans friends.
Natchitoches voted - "against the
amendment" in order to condemn the
system, sought to be inaugurated by
the last legislature, of framing a fun
demental law for a free people. Our
purpose was not to vote for either
tBaton Bouge or New Orleans ; suech
ng our intention we must insist
shall be so counted.

tbhis District, when we claimed the
bonors for our parish in the late elec
tins. We granted those honors to
Sabine in 1876 and In 1874, as a pe
roal of our files will show, and we
think surely that sueh a weakness on
our part as to exalt over our victory
,this year, should not rouse so mauch
venom and spite on the part of our
Sbiese eoOtemporary. It shows an
over Uensitiveness which~ we annot
comprehend.
At the Root.
Our esteetmed friends in Caddo
parish will pardon us should we dif
fer, as we most positively do, with
them in their mode of proceeding in
the face of Leonard's polinode. We
had thought, and still think, that to
pursue the old way of resisting fed
eral encroachments on the rights of
individual citizens of States is but tri
fling, and that too in a most indecent
manner, with the very serious issue
now before us. The utter folly of de
fending, by legal quibling and meta
phor, the personal liberty of a subject
of this commonwealth before a fed
eral court has been already amply
demonstrated, and we risk nothing in
asserting, that such is the very ex
tremity to which our opponents in
vite us.
Louisiana has before her a great
mission, and she, the greatest sufferer
in the sisterhood of States, must show
herself equal to the task. We are to
join issue on and decide before the
courts, the exact bounds of Federal
authority ; the precise limits of Fed
eral interferance, within the States.
Invitings ig.gstigatien, and meeting
it however succesfully, is only beg
ging the question and settles nothing
in the end, as it has settled nothing
in the past with tomes of pro and con
testimony already compiled.
Let us consider then, our defence,
and determine upon what ground the
Federal authorities base their claims
for the subversion of the reserved
rights of the States.
Leaving the appointment of super
visors (under Sec. 4, Constitution U.
S.) for future consideration, we beg to
call attention to the authority under
which Mr. Leonard proposes to exert
his efforts in beholf of Hayes and his
stalwarts. Art. 15 of the constitu
tion says:
"The right of citizens of the United
States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by
any State on account of race, eolor or
previous condition of servitude."
Now, we are no lawyer, buti we In
sist that no individual citizen of a
State can be called within the scope
of that amendment, and no "appropri
ate legislation," however ingeniously
worded, can give legal vitality to any
effort of Mr. Leonard's or the Federal
courts under that article. It provides
in plain words that "no State" shall
deprive any person of his rights on
account of his race or color. This
State has not done so, nor attempted
to do so. On the contrary she has
amply provided for their protection,
both by constitutional and statutory
law. Justice Bradly has already de
cided the question of "police regula
tions," and that decision has beeneus.
tained by a full bench of the Supreme
Court of the United States. The ques
tion now to be mnet is, whethler the
Federal government has the right to
come within the body of the States
and arrest and punish individual citi
zens thereof. Congress posesses such
powers only, as are granted by the
by the constitution. There is nothing
in Art. 15 which is capable of being
construed to grant such authority as
is claimed. On the contrary, the
meaning of the Article is plain and
perfectly expressed. It provides that
"neither the United States nor any
State shall abridge the right of suf
frage on account of race, color, dEc."
It s revolting to common sense to say
that admitting the charge that indivi
duals had maltreated negroes, the
Federal authorities could step in and
punish them. Her remedy is against
the States.
We insist this constitutio.,al battle
will be fought on principle. That
there will be no shuoking the issue;
so that we may settle for all time the
question of Federal interference ia
elections.
State Credit,
Our telegrams bring-to us the start
ling intelligence that the interest fund
for the payment of the interest
on the State debt far 1878 will be
shabort $230,000. Is is not in order for
another bond scheme to be promul
gated. This, added to $550,000 in
terest in arrears during three years
1875, 1876 and 1877,. make the gross
sum of nearly 8800,000 of interest
which our poverty striken State is
unable to pay. It will require but a
few years for the State to owe as
much interest as principjl, by this
showing.
Hayes haes. talked of his Southern
policy as if it deserved especial cora
mendation. It has been, from the
very beginning nothing but a dis
gusting reward of the scoundrels who
stole States, and put the fraud in of
hce. The Southern policy of Hayes
in this State was Wells, Anderson,
Smith, and every other Radical thietf
in offeial possition, to the utter dis
gust of decent people.
