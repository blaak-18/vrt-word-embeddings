t A Brutal Negro.
A little negro named Valmont,
in company with his father, Baptiste
SBreaux, appeared before Justice
e McFaddin Wednesday morning and
swore out an affidavit against
another negro, Edgar Dugas. The
a boy Valmont had been most cruelly
e dealt with by Dugas. His chin ani
s mouth were in a painful condition,
t and his jaw bone was broken. He
s says that Dugas inflicted these in
juries by kicking him without prov
ocation. The boy was badly
bruised up and bore evidences of
Dugas' vicious attack upon him.
d Shot in the Pace.
Adlar Boudain, a white man, has
been charged by an affidavit before
Justice McFadden, with having
r, shot at a negro named Alexis Gil
s bert. A few birdshlots took lodg
- ment in the negro's face. It seems
r that Baudain was hunting in the
, negro's field and the difficulty
grew out of this fact.
WAS -IT REMORSE 7- -
W. J. Deady Wants to be -Put In
Jail fora Murder Comlnitted
Fifteen Years Ago.
At about six o'clock Thursday
evening a well dressed man walked
into the sheriff's office and stated to
Deputy Thomas Mouton that he
wanted to surrender to the authori
ties. He gave the name of W. J.
Deady and said that he had killed
a man named Gus Williamson at
Eureka, Ark., on July 5, z88o, and
had been a fugitives ever since.
Though the killing was done in self
defense he could bear the strain no
longer and wanted to stand trial,
preferring to serve a term in the
penitentiary than to continue a fu
gitive. He had evidently been
drinking heavily, but was sufficient
ly sober to appreciate the serious
consequences that may result from
his admissions. He spoke- well and
appeared to be a gentleman. At
times he showed signs of a troubled
mind, saying that life had become
intolerable.
Deputy Mouton made the neces
sary atlidavit and lodged Deady in
jail awaiting instructions from the
Arkansas authorities to whom
Deputy Billaud has telegraphed for
information. Deady claims to have
worked during the grinding season
as cane-weigher on the Bon-,illain
plantation in Assumption parish.
Some papers on his person corro
borated this statement.
Stole a Gig.
Desire Dugas, a negro, ischarged
with having stolen a gig and horse
during the night of the circus last
week. He was brought before
Justice McFaddin who bailed him in
the sum of $50.
A Phantoml Party.
A surprise party-a real surprise
party-was gotten up by a number
of young people last Monday night.
They assembled at the home of
Mrs. J. J. Revillon whele every one
donned a phantom's garb and
looked every bit like one from the
supernatural world. When every
thing was in readiness the part)
placed itself in line, and with Mrs.
Revillon as chaperon. iprced. le,
ghost-l:k., to tie os:,pita!ble :one
of Mr. ;nd Mrs [.eon Plonsky, who
LioLughi taken by surprise, were
equal to occasion, and received the
party with such cordiality that one
was inclined to believe that they
were accustomed to receiving guests
from the land of spirits. The doors
of the ceautiful parlors were thrown
wide open and the merry crowd of
unknown intruders were bidden a
hearty welcome with the. unres
trainedl hospita!ity s:) characteris
tic of Mr. '!.,nsky an-I his amiable
family.
After a short ti;ne the phantoms
di:cos.d their identity andi inrdulged

His selection is a splendid one.

Patronize Homne People.
If you want to build your town
patronize home people. Do not
send to sighboring towns for work

Then why should you patronize
people who do not patronize you.

Too Much PoliticRs.
Wednesday's Timnes- Democrat
contains a lengtihy accuit of the
SMardi Gras celebration in our
ne'ghborin4 town of St. Martinvil!e.
'rhe affair was very creditable and
speaks highly of the public-slpirit
and enterprise of the citizens of that
town. In future years let Lafa
yette throw aside its bickerings and
animosities and profit by the exam
ple of its neighbor. It will not do to
let politics stand in the way of uni
ty. Politics during election times
are a natural consequence of our
system of government, but when
ever the people will allow political
influences to be wedged in commer
cial affairs the prosperity uf the
Eoummunity will immevitabl), suffer.
. MARDI GRAS.
1 Lafayette Puts on Holiday Attire
and Celebrates.
Did you see the parade >
It was there all right enough, in
fact two of them, and when it comes
to celebrating Mardi Gras Lafayette
Isn't out taking any lessons. New
Orleans may think she has a cinch
on this sort of thing, but she hasn't.
Lafayette bites off a slice of Mnardi
Gras herself and knows it is good.
The day was fair and just such a
day as Rex might have ordered had
he deigned to stop, but his bold
knights knew how to enjoy it and
perhaps did enjoy it more than if
-his Royal Highness had lent the
weight of his august presence to the
occasion.
Early in the day his Majesty's
subjects were out in holiday attire
making merry and otherwise doing
honor to the day set apart for jollity
and good humor.
A bold company of knights on
their way to the Grand Carnival,
but who were delayed by the snow,
were expected to favor our royal
little city withltheir presence. Ti'!
ings of their approach was awaited
with great anxiety. Just before
noon, a dispatch signed by His EIx
cellency, the Chief High Monk,
was received notifying Rex's leige
subjects that His Excellency and
the gallant knights of his suite would
enter Lafayette at 3 o'clock sharp.
Promptly at the appointed hour,
His Excellency, accompanied by his
lovely wife and the Lafayette Brass
Band, made his appearance. The
hand discoursed sweet music on a
variety of musical instruments,
F some of which are unknown to
fame. Only the cultivated ear, cul
tivated in the realms ot Rex, could
ically enjoy such operatic music.
"Followin-t were a ha'd,'n!some youth
and tbri ch going to chiurch on a vel
vety carl:et of grass, dressed in
stylish Lafayette tailor-made suits,
while their fine Milwaukee carriage
bore the inscription, "Going to
church before the stock law."
"'I had plenty of milk to sell be
fore the stock law," was the sad
plaint of the next bold knight whose
round and jolly stomatch told that
there was somletling "in it"-the
milk bu.sine:;s, of course.
Tihe follow\ing knight seemed in
hard luck. "No grass, no cow, no
milk," painted on his dcliapida ,ted
I cart told the story of his little can,
is white hair, anl. his dIejected
1Mauad S.
Two fair ladies walking in grass
waste-hi gh shtiiav9 the d iticulties of
",Going to church after the stock
law," as their banner t,oll.
F ollowing came the oble aiod
handsome firemen of "l.iavett
Fire Co. N . 6, organ ized Feb. 2,
zS;." Eight brave knis and a
fireman of comminandin'g presc-nce,
provided with buckets, brooms,
1squirt guns, step ladlde rs, anl a
trumpet bade dcfiance to the fire
fiend and brought comfort to his
Majesty's subjects.
Closing the procession came one
of Lafayette's manly farmers hun
ting for the Lafayette Sugar Refinery
with a pair of spectacles and a load
of cane. Though his little boy did
the driving and the farmer sprained
his neck looking, at last accounts
the refinery was still just ahead
in the air. This ended, this mag
nificent parade whichafforded much
amusement to the people along its
route.
At four o'clock a gay company
of charming ladies and handsome
knights bearing various legends on
ttheir royal vehicles, knocked at the
Sgates of the city. They were hearti
Sly welcomed and bidden enter and
Sthe streets of the city nimadle free to
then. They were a gallant set of
knights and had grand eqluipage.,
Sdecorated in many colors like the
rainbow. In a gorgeous coach
drawn by a pair of beautiful
Shorses, and tastefully decorated with
ribbons and draperies, sat a bevy
Sof lovely maidens thought to have
been the fair maids of honor to Her
Majesty, the Queen, sent to Iafa
vette as a gracious token of tier
SMajesty's favor to the Queen city
of the Prairie. Tihis brilliant dis
play w is the close of the parade
Swhichi will long be rc:nembered by
all who witnessed it.
THIE IBAl...
W'hen night threw her dewy man
tie over earth the lads and fair
lassies of Rex's court betook them
selves to the large and spacious hall,
called Falk's hall, and there to the
attuned sounds of the svweet music
of the Landry Band trippedl the
light fantastic toe till midnight bells
Schimed the warning that Mardi Gras
was ended.
A fool carries his name in his
Hnonuth,
-It was rumored last week that
the Teche Railroad and Sugar
Company were offering all the way
from fifty to a hundred cents on the
dollar, in settlement of the old
claims. Several of our business
men, to whom large amounts are
owing hied themselves to Ope
lousas in poste haste, to see if there
was any truth in what they had
heard. They returned -home next
day, sadder and wiser men; out
just the expense of their trip.
-Prof, Chas. Heichelheim and
wife left last Sunday for New Or
leans, where they will make their
future home. Prof. Ileichelheim
was a resident of Carencro for
nearly nine years, being for a long
time principal of the Catholic Pa
rochial School, and for the last two
years filled the position ot assistant
teacher of the Carencro public
school. He always proved him
self a conscientious, painstaking
and thoroughly competent teacher.
His departure for New Orleans,
where he goes to accept a more
pl-ofitable position, deprives Car
encro of one of her best citizens.
We extend to him our heartiest
wishes for his future success
-Mr. and Mrs. V. E. Dupuis,
Messrs. A. I. Guilbeau, G. H.
Guilbeau, Maurice Francez, H.
Crouchet, A. C. Guilbeau, T. L.
Baily, and J. B. Clemerit, were
among those who went to the city to
share in the plheasurers of the car
nival.
--Mr. Deleglise has had his sa
loon enlarged, irepainted, and re
fitted. It presents a very nice ap
pearance.
-M-Ir. J. R. Jeanmard, of Breaux
Bridge, was in town last week.
-Mr. and Mrs. Funpe, of Bar
aga, Mich., returned home last
week after spending a few days in
Carencro, the guests of Rev. Father
Laforest.
-The weather for the last fif
teen days has been a caution with
a capital "C." The barometer
gave us rain, snow, and sunshine,
while the thermometer gave us
everything from ten to sixty de
grees.
--\Work on the new church is
progressing steadily. The weather
i-knocked our fair out; but the
clhurch buihding does not seem to
know it.
--Mrs. 1). A. Dimitry and chil
dren are in New Orleans visiting
relativts.
-Mr. S. Broussard's residence
presents a very neat appearance
since it has been painted.
-Mr. A. Salizonni has opened a
grocery store in the Guchereau
building.
-I)r. J. P. Francez returned
home last week from his trip to
the gulf shore, where he had a very
nice time, in spite of the severe
weatiher.
--Last season's experience and
the present hard times have knocked
some of the wind out of our sails,
but please remember that Carencro
is still doing business at the old
stand; land is much cheaper but
just as fertile as ever. The rice,
corn, cotton, tobacco, potatoes,
and sugar-cane planted next to each
other thrive just as well as they did
a c6uple of years ago, when times
were better. Our people are de
pressed, but they remain the same
whole-souled, honest people that
they ever were. WVe can not tell
you that sugar cane is worth four
dollars a ton, or that cotton will
bring ten cents per pound; but we
can tell you that you can raise
either, as easily here as anywhere.
And while our present state of "ill
health" will not permit us to crow
too loud; still we ufind that we are
ho worse off than our neighbors.
--Mr. Sam P. Brown and Mtr.
IPat G(uilbenau attended the ball in
Lafayette last week.
--Yhen the ''woman s1ffragists"
succeed in their plan to be permit
ted to serve on the jury, may be thc
men will be more willing to serve
--\Ve regret to learn that Mr.
C aston 111ot is still sick, and con
fined to his room.
--Mr. J. Ilum was a visitor in
Opelousas and New Orleans this
week.
