Gov. Brown and Judge Morris
Dear Mr. Watson:—l have been
reading in the Atlanta Constitution,
the charges of Judge N. A. Morris,
that Governor Brown did not do right
in refusing to interfere with the
death sentence of the negro Kellog.
I thought at the time of reading
Judge Morris’ first letter, that, as he
was the judge in the case, if he
thought the verdict was unjust he
should have done something about
it.
But knowing very little of law, I
was waiting for more light on the
subject. And as the light did not
come, I now write to ask you to
please inform me who is right in the
Kellog case,Governor BrownorJudge
Morris. I will state here that your
opinion is final for me, as I know
you never speak until you are posi
tive.
Hoping an answer to this will not
aause you worry,
I am very respectfully,
H. H. E.
Dublin, Ga.
Answer.
My Dear Sir:—Governor Brown is
right and Newt. Morris is wrong.
Whatever errors there were in the
trial and conviction of the negro
should have been corrected by the
Courts. It is not the business of a
Governor to correct errors of Judges.
Every man should discharge the du
ties of the position which he holds,
er resign it.
Executive clemency rarely turns
upon a mistake made in the trial of a
case, and, so far as I know, is never
employed to correct mistakes which
the Courts had full opportunity to
correct and which they failed to cor-
Batson’s MONEY AND MANKIND: Mr. Watson, in his

== CRYING FOR BREAD: There was a time when
we had no poor, and now
“The production of all kinds of wealth was never so great. We
jfflj have become the Egypt of the famished world, —and yet our
® children cry for bread, the widow wails unheard, the man out
of work tramps the streets, looking for a job until he drops and
dies, like a homeless, ownerless dog. It is maddening.”
THE CAUSES: These are the abominations which are
= called “ laws’" of the United States for
• the favoring of the few and the spoliation of the many, making
beggars of the wage-earner, the farmer and the average mer
chant. The protection madness, gone to such lengths that com
p ' petition has disappeared, and the trusts are supreme.
A sl THE REMEDY: Extract the deadly virus of class
=== s legislation. Restore the laws under
which our country had prospered for half a century, and under
which American statesmen could truthfully, proudly say, “We
have no poor.”

rect. The pardoning power is usual
ly employed in consequence of some
phase of the case which the Courts,
under the law, had no authority to
consider. Frequently, Executive clem
ency operates upon newly dis
covered evidence which is found after
the Courts have finished with the
case. In other instances evidence
which was not laid before the Judge
and the jury is brought before the
Governor, and this evidence, mate
rially altering the state of the case,
inclines the Chief Executive to
mercy.
Other cases where the pardoning
power is employed are those in which
a portion of the sentence has been
served, and, for one reason or an
other, it is deemed wise and proper
to exercise clemency.
As a matter of fact, Courts and
Governors are entirely too lenient in
dealing with criminals. My own
experience of about twenty-five years
at the bar convinced me that it was
practically impossible to convict an
innocent man in this country. All
the chances are in favor of the crimi
nal, and the State labors under the
greatest disadvantages. Prosecuting
officers have tasks of the utmost diffi
culty. When they do manage to run
the gauntlet of fixed witnesses, fixed
jurors, sympathetic judges and juries,
technicalities, etc., etc., and secure
the final conviction, a tremendous
pressure is often brought to bear to
Blje Jeffersonian
annul the verdict by having the Gov
ernor intervene.
A few years ago, a woman who had
married a man named Dixon, tempt
ed a youth of eighteen years, named
Waldon, to help her slaughter her
own husband, in his own bed, with
his own axe. A more brutal murder
was never committed since God made
man, yet this she-devil was pardoned
out when she had only served two or
three years of her term. The jury
had exercised the utmost clemency in
not condemning her to death; they
stretched the limits of leniency by
recommending her to the mercy of
the Court. After she had served two
or three years, a great cry was raised
that she was in bad health and would
die if she were not released. Pressure
was brought to bear upon the Gov
ernor, and he pardoned this terrible
woman. Os course, her health was
immediately recovered. The whole
pretense about her being in wretched
health and in danger of dying from
confinement in the prison was a fake.
That hell-cat is now loose, while her
paramour—the eighteen-year-old boy
whom she tempted—is yet in the
penitentiary. WTiether he ought to
be pardoned is a problem of the most
serious character. While it was
wrong to pardon the woman, would
it also be wrong to pardon her part
ner in crime? Two wrongs never
make a right, and, consequently, I
frankly confess that were I the Gov
ernor and had to pass upon Waldon’s
application for pardon, now pending,
the application would distress me
grievously. But, if it eould be
shown that the young man had borne
a high character up to the time that
he fell under the influence of that
demon-like woman, and that bis be
havior since his confinement in the
Penitentiary has been exemplary, I
have little doubt that he would go
free.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.
Sinking Spells
Every Few Days
“At the time I began taking
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy I was
having sinking spells every few
days. My hands and feet would
get cold; I could scarcely
breathe, and could feel myself
gradually sinking away until I
would be unconscious. Those
about me could not tell there
was life in me. After these
spells I would be very weak and
nervous, sleepless and without
appetite; had neuralgia in my
head and heart. After taking
the remedy a short time all this
disappeared and in a few weeks
all the heart trouble was gone.”
