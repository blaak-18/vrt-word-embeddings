The revenue bill as finally paused e
the House as amended, and goes to t
the senate. Upon its third reading PI
Sunanlimous vote was given ln its tr
favor. This doesnotargue, however, 0
that It was eatfactory to all the t
members. On the ontrary a very to
strong opposition exists to t, and a ol
number of members explained that Im
they only voted for It to get it be- qi
fore the Benate. It is now believed 1N
tbat the enate will amend the mess
ure to make is oonform to moest of te b
provisions, to the s albill. It m
this Is done, there will be a coniats
between the two Houses, and a com b
mlttee of cooloreaoe will have to
be appointed to settle the existing
differences. As the bill now stands. of
Its better title would be "An act to U
preventibe oollkdtlon of taxes," be
cause it otffers every Induoement to i
tax pay era not to ay, and under its 1
operjtioo the delinquent list it would gi
be laer than ever. This is wnhat
arouses suchb oppositton to It. Mei. I
