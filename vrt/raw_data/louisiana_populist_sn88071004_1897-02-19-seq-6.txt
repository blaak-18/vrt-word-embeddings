this larish sonmeic twelves years ago
ntiMl settled down to school teach
ing, and farnning. ie joined the
Farmers Alliance in 1sS7, and be
came a leaCtdling memnber of that
gr'and organization. By the Al
lian1ce he was sent as a dt(leltate to
tlhe ('incinnatti convention that Iet
on the 19th of May, I sN1, where
the Peoples party was really born.
This was ,on of the most notable
gatherings that has ever assem
bled on the continent in iore res
pecls thali llline.
Mr. Blrian was nomnj1:ated by the
Peoples party of this parish for
retreirsntative in 1s511. lIe was
,eccted in the spring of 15s!2 by at
bii majority, and served with'dis
tinctionl two sCssions of the Ileis
lature. while li- father was ai menll
ber of the State Senate at the sllme
time.
Mr. iBrian enjoys Ihe distinction
of editing the first Peloples party
aipeIr establishedl in the Souith
The Comrade, founded by him
Oct. 3rd, 1Mi!). Ye humbnle edi
tor was associate at that time.
In 1894, Mr. Brian establised
the Louisiana Populist and reimov
ed to Natchitoches, where he now
resides.
In 19!t, lie was elected chair
man of the State conimnittee of the
Peoples party. lie condicted the
Populist end of the State campaign
in IsNllt with signal success. This
was tne nmost brilli,mnt c:ampaign
that any party in the State has
ever made. 1and had (t not been for
the countin nimachinb, Capt. John
N. Pharr, the standard bearer of
(,lr party in that i;peinorable con
test, would today be governor of
hie State.
Mr. Brian is one of the ablest
men in the State, in or out of the
Peoples plarty. His ability is re
co(tnized by his Olpponents as well
an by his friends. Hie has made
the best tight for the priciples of
the Populist party possible,, under
the circumastances. He has never
faltered, but has always continued
to shell the enemy with grape and
canister.
He would he an honor to the
State and the district and a credit
to himself in the congress of the
U/nited States. Few menl of Mr.
Brian's opportunities are able to
boast of thhe endowments he pos
sesses. He is energetic and one
of the most ready del aters.we have
ever known. A . brainier nlan
