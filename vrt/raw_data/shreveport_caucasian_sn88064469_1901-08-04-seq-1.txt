sitll Neck FPling Iasntirely Out of Itf
other smair Notions.
A very notll.alke fteature of rummern
dress Is tihe siiIlplicity ,of color, or. rath
er, the predomlnating use of neutral
colors In delicate shad."s of gray Itad
ihele, Ibosi(les eV l'ry I.osRlile tint oft
white. Even the foulards are delicate,
In coloring and are tomitl down stilt
more by the use of stitched bunds of
cloth or taffeta In the predominating
color of the silk.
In all the summer gowns, whether
they are of silk, muslin or linen, the
collar bands and the chemlsettes are as
trnlisparent an it Is possible to make
them and have them keep In place at
all. Stifl neck flixings of any sort are
entirely out of It thills season, and many
gowns have no choker collar at all, be
ing cut out just below the collar line
In a round neck, a mode so becoming
to the exceptional style of beauty and
so unbecoming to the average woman.
However, this Is an Inevitable mode
with the latest style of hairdressing,
the low coil In the nape of the neck,
one being a pretty accompaniment for
thn other.
'bhis low neck and elbow sleeves are
shown In the illustration from the New
York sun, which is authority also for
these Items of fashion. The gown Is a
white organdie with a lattlcework de
sign In blaek lace insertion. A lower
design In applique lace Is added In the
front of the skirt and bodles.
Another feature which Is a natoral
outcome of the low dressed hair Is the

bow of ribbon or fall of lace at the
back of the hat, filting in the spnce
which otherwise would make an ugly
line. The brims droop somewbat, of
course, but the bow is necessary tW
soften the effect.
The LouIl XV period In dres lis
more and more in evidence all the tiote.
Flowetres effects. generally In tilks.
musliln and trimuilngs, are convincnug
proof tlint bthi one page of time has
Ieun turned back ftr Itipiration. Iro
caded sllk insertions and motifs are set
luto lace gowns, and strlped and plain
musllas are trlncmed with medallions
of cretonne flowers set luside shaped
designs of lace.
All the dreasy gowns are long and
very fuffy, with gauzy rufles around
the feet. The one idea In the finish at
tbhe hem is to give as much of the di
aphai:ous effect as possible, and we
see a seriM of chiffon ruffes around
the hem of a foulard rown.
A now and very smartJdes In trim
inng Is the sea of taffeta bands oa
white batiste. They may be straight
or waved on the edges and dotted aver
with French dots of embroidered pblka
dots. The silk msy be white or sonmu
pale color, as you fancy, but in either
case the effect is stunning.
This Idea of using silk on thin mus
1In Is seen agailn n satin ribbon two
aIches wide on a white organdle. Three
rows of thisa with spaces between, are
sewed around the skirt, and the yoke
is of alternate bands of ribbon and lace

each band.

Dark blue merge is a light and coo;
material for surpmer wear. and It
seems to be again coming Into voguor
among the Isrger number of well dress

double breasted. the latter cut goes ex

Materials.
If one dos not care for the double
breasted or ordinary type of sInjle
breasted coat, that cut with only.ono
ow of buttons, but stralgbt and square
la front, is a good style for blue serge.
The lapels may be of the usual sack

one desires, and the pockets may be
