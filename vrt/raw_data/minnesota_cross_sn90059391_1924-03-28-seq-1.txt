TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
UNITY
KLAN MOTIVES
THE PORTAL OF THE INVIS
IBLE EMPIRE
THE other night I heard an
artist bring forth from a
pipe organ wonderful harmonies
of joy, hope, anticipation, thank
fulness, beauty, love, faith, devo
tion. As I watched the master
touch the keys of the splendid
instrument before which he was
seated, a thought forced itself
upon me. How essential unity is
in the proper execution of all
things meritorious! Unity!
Write the word indelibly on the
scrolls of your mind. If, as the
organist played, one key, or any
other part tff the mechanism, re
fused to do its work, became in
active, there would be discord,
and possibly a denunciation of
the master on the part of those
who came to listen to the work
of the artist.
The Klan must have unity. Ev
ery Klansman must become an
"active portion of one stupen
dous whole.” Individual indif
ference, petty jealousies, false
activities and the assertion of
evil bring forth syncopations of
discord instead of harmonies of
unity.
If we, consciously or uncon
sciously, allow ourselves to be
come mesmerized by notions
apart from the Klan program,
and thus become inactive, inert,
indifferent, unkindly critical, or
shift our work to other shoulders,
we shall soon have "false notes,”
"dead keys”—discord in our or
ganization. We will then sing
songs of hate instead of love.
Klansmen, we have undertaken
to build, lovingly and truly, and
our work *h«v-14-.he by
the divine principles of Klan
kraft.
us resolve, Klansmen all, to
express unity in our love for our
country, our homes and each oth
er. Drop a pebble of sound
Americanism in the waters of hu
man welfare, and it shall cause a
ripple which )jrill be felt on the
farthest shores of world con
sciousness. A Klansman living
truly for others rather than self
will erect a "building of God, a
house not made with hands, eter
nal in the heavens.”
RIGHT motives are necessary to

virtual without a motive Is like
a rudderless ship upon the sea. con

be of the right klnd?”Of course you
answer In the affirmative, flood mo

Impel us toward the darkness of de
struction.
An organisation without motives
would be as vain ns life without mo
tives. Motives clearly present Indi
viduals and organisations on bases
that are easily understood by open
minds. The Ku Klux Klnn as a “great
and essentially a patriotic fraternal,
benevolent order" Is moving forward
toward a port of genuine American
ism. Write It down—“ The prime
purpose of this great order Is to i e

to protect the home and the chastity
of womanhood, and to exemplify »
pure patriotism towards our glori
ous country.”
KLANSMEN. it behooves you to
guard well the portal of the In
visible Empire. Men of low
ideals, uncertain conceptions of life,
questionable motives for seeking cit
izenship, careless attitudes toward
right and wrong should never be per
mitted to enter the Klavern. The
Klan does not appeal to such men
and shortly they may become “ene
mies within the gates.” If the Ku
Klux Klan goes down in wreckage, it
will be due to the failures on the
part of those Klansmen who did not
guard well the portal of the Invisi
ble Empire.
Look well to the “distinguishing
marks” a chivalric head, a compas
sionate heart, a prudent tongue and
a courageous will.
No man who is not known to be of

through fair and stormy weather be

Lecture Given at Citizens’ Alli

Harry F. Atwood of Chicago,
president of Constitution Anni

"Back to the Republic,” "Safe
guarding American Ideals," and
"Keep God in American History,”
in his lecture delivered at the
Citizens’ Alliance meeting held
in the St. Paul Athletic club last
Thursday night, pointed out
some striking facts pertaining
to the United States constitution.
He sounded warnings that should
be carefully considered by all Ameri
cans, in fact, Atwood’s entire address
was so much like a Ku Klux Klan
lecture, that one might think he
heard a discussion on the constitu
tion by a national Klan speaker.
“America today is living in an age
of expediency, cowardice and dema
gogy.” said Mr. Atwood. “The gener
ation now living has been the most
faithless to its governmental heri
tage of any in the history of the
world.
“Six years ago, I started to resur
rect the constitution of the United
States, the document that in itself
contains a plain answer and solution
of virtually all of the problems that
are vexing our country so sorely to
day.

written there was in America just

However, bear in mind that a man

AMERICA FACES ECONOMIC STATUS OF
RUSSIA IF FARMERS ARE NOT AIDED
Arguing that unless living condi
tions on the farms of the northwest
are changed, the people of the Unit
ed States will find themselves in the
present economic position of soviet
Russia within five years, Edward
Barr, secretary of the agricultural
and retail subdivisions of the St.
Paul association, told members ot
the St. Paul Association of Office Men
in the Athletic club Tuesday after
noon, that in the present crisis the
union looked to the northwest to
lead the way.
Mr. Barr declared 1,200,000 farm
ers had left their farms over the
United States in 1922. that in New
York state alone 26,000 hud abandon
ed agriculture and that in 16 corn
and wheat producing states 24'3 per
cent had virtually lost their farms
through bankruptcy. He said farm
bankruptcy had increused from five
to 14 per cent since pre-war days.

Convention Will “Do Just as La-
Follette Wants" Says Na

Simmering activities in third
party circles warmed up considerably
Thursday following the establishment
of what is officially termed the Na

convention headquarters at Labor
Temple, St. Paul, and announcement
by William Mahoney that the propos
ed national convention June 17 will
seek to form preliminary working
units in every state of the union, and
will “do what LaFollette wants” in
the way of procedure and platform.
This means that the convention
will be in the nature of a many-ring
circus, as the various state delega
tions will meet at one time or an
other in various halls to be obtained
in addition to the convention hall or
auditorium, he said.
Omaha .Makes Bid
Mr. Mahoney said Omaha is mak
ing a strenuous bid for the conven
tion, even offering to furnish the
halls necessary and pay all conven
tion expenses.
It is generally understood, how
ever, that the convention will be held
either in Minneapolis or St. Paul, as
it was the censensus of opinion
at the northwest conference to de
cide on the date of the convention
that the Twin Cities are located ex
actly right from a geographical-poli
tical viewpoint.
The first intimation that Omaha
wanted the convention came at the
conference, but it received scant at

Referring to the newly formed
Minnesota Potato Growers’ exchange.
Mr. Barr said 12,220 farmers will

co-operative marketing looks toward

MORE APPROACHABLE
Arthur E. Sees Governor’s (’hair
Fulling into Dim Distant
Impossibility
(By TWILIGHT)
George L. Siegel, the Labor candi
date for mayor, defeated Mayor Nel
son by 1743 votes in the primary
e-lection. The present indications
point to one of the stiffest mayoral
ty races between Siegel and Nelson
that St. Paul has had in many a
year.
Mayor Arthur E. Nelson was so con
fident of his vote pulling ability, that
he remained throughout the primary
election campaign very nearly unap
proachable. The election returns
prove 'beyond the possibility of a
doubt that Turkish baths, manipula
tions and grand stand play for votes
did not count for very much. It is
thought by many who are keen poli
tical observers that Nelson will take
a n entirely different attitude
throughout the stretch between the
primary election and the final deci
sion of the St. Paul voters.
Didn’t Answer Questions
In the issue of February 29, The
Minnesota Fiery Cross asked Mayor
Nelson some definite questions. His
failure to answer them publicly did
him no good. The mayors denuncia
tion of the great Protestant organ
ization, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
in his Washington day address, de
livered in the St. Paul auditorium on
the evening of February 22, served as
a boomerang artd missed fire badly.
The election returns tell a long story
with startling briefness. Of course
the supporters of the St. Paul mayor
are making the usual after-tne
primary predictions and point to an
awakening that will mean better
days for Arthur E. I am wondering as
I hear these ultra-enthusiastic pre
dictions, how many Turkish baths
there are between the mayor’s office
and private life.
Arendt and Sherman, as candidates
for mayor, received so few votes that
one would hardly know that they
were in the race at all. The two re
ceived only 1071 votes all told.
In the final count Mayor Nelson re
ceived 22,499 votes and Siegel 25,242
votes. I’ll wanger an Angora cat
against a night yowling Tommy that
the Siegel strength makes Arthur E.
grind his teeth as he beholds the van
ishing governor’s chair. But then a
Turkish bath or two might prove
soothing.

AMERICA, LOST IN WILDERNESS OF
POLITICS, NEEDS STRONG LEADER
Pronouncing America lost in
the wilderness of politics, the
Rev. W. T. McElveen pleaded for
a superleader in politics in his
morning sermon at the Plymouth
Congregational church, St. Paul,
Sunday, March 16.
“What America sorely needs,”
he said, “is for some great lead

politics is in a terrible mess.

Stop Divorces
Before Wedding,
Says Minister
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., March 17.
The time for stopping a divorce is
before the wedding, Dr. F. L. Roberts,
pastor of Wesley Methodist church
declared in a sermon based on the
story, “Let No Man Put Asunder.”
“If persons entered the marriage
relation with a spirit of sacrifice,
courage and self control, instead of
selfishness and passion, there would
be much less divorce,” Mr. Roberts
said.
“There are few marriages these
days that are based on real love. It
fails to my lot to perform many mar
riage ceremonies. There is an air <Vt
negation in the attitude of many who
come before me for that purpose
an air that indidcates that the mar
riage is only a temporary arrange

in the r elation has disappeared to a
great extent.
“Our set almost likes you better

DODGE COUNTY KLAN
BURNS FIERY CROSS
St. Patrick’s Day Is Time Select

Riled
(By EYETHERE)
WEST CONCORD, MINN.. March
20. On St. Patrick’s day night, the
Dodge county Klan got together in
the town of West Concord, one of the
beauty spots of southern Minnesota,
and set off a ten foot cross. It was
witnessed by a goodly number of
people who were dancers and specta
tors at an American Legion ball.
The “policeman” whose most inter
esting work seems to be “running
down them Klukers” became very
much agitated over the appearance
of the fiery cross.
We understand that a certain ele
ment here is planning to boycott all
business men who are alleged to be
members of the Klan. But in that
all the business men here are Pro
testants and therefore accused of be
ing Klansmen it is hard to dope out
who will be forced out of business
by the seven or eight non-Protestant
families who happen to live in West
Concord.
The Dodge county Klan is growing
rapidly and already has attained a
membership strength that assures
some real constructive action in the
near future.

The Salvation Army and the Union
Gospel Mission have provided home
less men with 17,769 meals and 4.228
beds during December, January and
February.
This report was made Friday to
the Community Chest.
The Chest directors have author
ized payments totaling $2,199.79 tc
these agencies to assist their work
for homeless men.
While a large nomber of unempioy
ed men were given accommodations
during February, the situation in
March has improved untih many men
are now able to find work, according
to Adjt. E. J. Alder of the Salvation
Army.
“The railroads have taken a num
ber of men for construction work in
Montana and other points in the
northwest.” Adjt. Alder said. “We
are also finding an increased local
demand for workers.
Adjt. Alder asserted that the work
of the two agencies had made it un
necessary for homeless men to beg
on St. Paul streets this winter.
Because of the improved conditions
the Community Chest announced an
agreement by which it would only
finance the work of the Salvation
Army for homeless men after Satur

Relates History of Moose Luke
Fire, of 191M,Blamed on
His Negligence
ST. PAUL, MINN., March 24
W. T. Cox, former state forester
of Minnesota, today denied the
charges recently made that lax
ity on the part of Mr. Cox in en
forcing the state forestry laws
was responsible for the Moose
Lake fire of 1918.
Mr. Cox. on the other hand,
charges that the state timber
board, controlled and dominated
by Governor Preus. sold thou
sands o facres of immature tim
ber which should have been re
served for future growth, the
state thereby losing thousands
of dollars and the state forests
being "depleted just that much.
In denying that forestry funds
were used for political propaganda.
Mr. Cox said:
“Not one cent was illegally, im
properly or unwisely spent. The
campaign for the forestry amend
ment to authorize the establishment
of permanent state forests was con
ducted and paid for by the forestry
association.”
t Text of Ktate«ent
The statement of Mr. Cox follows:
“Governor Preus’ speech of last
Wednesday as printed in a number of
papers, demands at least a brief re
ply. In his attempt to explain his
appointments to the forestry board
and the recent action of the board,
he seems to have been driven to des
peration.
“Mr. Preus’ attitude in (he matter
of forest conservation has been well
understood for years. His belated
efforts to obtain credit for a few
conservation gestures he was forced
to make will be understood also.
“The governor must know that
whi|e we have never had the amount
