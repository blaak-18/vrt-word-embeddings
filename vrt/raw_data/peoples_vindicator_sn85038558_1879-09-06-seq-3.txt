50 We have heard it said that this oone.
64 try was "fit for nothing save to make
cotton" but we have regarded such a
statement as an effusion of that east iron
79 prejudice which we have before spoken
of and which exists here to the extent of
of blasting this country, as rich naturally
Red as the sun ever shone upon, with rain.
However, serious innovations are being
made into old ideas and startling revel
ations daily occur. Among the moeet
startling is the fact that Texas cattle
be speculators are buying eattle in this and
411" surrounding parishes for the purpose of
sty driving them to Texas-the prairie coun
ut ties at that-and selling them
or And why not ?
Cattle can be reared here chaper than
in Tesa.; our Bermuda grass lands are
P beyond doubt the hest grazing lands in
Y the world, we have mild and short win -
ters and the climate is particularly
s adapted to stock. All these reasons,
Swhich cannot be contradicted, prove that
S. we cain raise cattle, and sell them for a
good profit cheaper than Texas.
Mr. Bonner, from that State, has to
this time bought over six hundred head
of cattle which he proposes to drive to
Texas Here the best price for "3 and
at 4 year old's" ise 8 to $12 while in Texas
rI the price is $18 to $22. In the fuce of
bt. this fact our-people dig at cotton, buy
corn and meat and talk about more green
ills backs, while Ahe fact is patent that we
m. have a fortune within our grasp if we
willonly act like men of sense and give
up our prejudices and old exploded the

ad New cotton cones in rather slowly

a Monday morning last the business year
of 1879 closed and the result is as satis
he factory as could be expected.
The erop of the past season is the lar
it gest ever produced, being 203,583 bales
I in excess of the crop of 1877.78. The re
1- eeipts at all the ports for year ending
ol last night showed a total of44,5,m777
hales. The crop was estimated in July
t- by experts at 5,150,000 bales. While it
will semarelf reach that amount it will
m not fall much short, when the steeks at I
the interior towns that have gone direct
s tothe factories are added to the receipts
at all the ports. From the lights before
us we estimate the crop at about 4,900,
000. The present erop is very promeisig,
but it is estimated that the yield will
º- not be as large as that eof the past season.

Sinace oar last the weather has been
ýI sudden atamerish to a dot. Dry ,and
dusty are the roads, and cotton is open
ing with rapidity, while above, the sky
is pure blue and air is cool and balmy.
Our nigbht watches are spent comfortably
P* eunder blanckets.
se Our farmers are yet happy-or at least
a so-so; they have ceased grumbling "cat.
vo erpillars'".i a measure and gone to has
en lug their growls on the storms. With
of a farmer when it rains "it's too wet,"
Ily when it stops "it's to dry",-and here we
n. go.
ng Corn crops are shbort, but large quan
1- titles of pea and bermuda hay has been
st made and stored.
lie As a matter of interest to our farmers
ad we publish the following selection from
of an exchange :
in- Pnaoh x a or Hrx.-One of the
most curious things about rain is the in
equality of its distribution. The reader
is of course aware that rain may be
n measured in inches in almost any vessel
o set out to catch it, If a pail for example,
in be put out in an open space on the
ground on the space scrupied by the
pail. If we visit the pail after every
ly shower, we may by means of a two foot
I, role, tell what depth of rain has fAllel,.
Tlims is theprinciple of the ruin gauge.
In practice better means are of course
a adopted, so as to prevent evalporation
and ýo measure the dept. Now it is of I
to great consequence where we place our
rain gnnge. It might be supposed of no
Si,,portance whheher it were oil the top
to of the house or in the garden close by.
id And yet, strange to say, a glage in the I
Sgarder,. near Westlinister Abbey canught
twenty-three inchesof rain in the course
Sof a year, while one on the roofofa
:y house caught only eighteen inches, and
n- one on top of the Abbey only twelve in
ches Tie fact is rain forns at a very
e low elevation, much lower than is gee
e orally supposed ; or, if not actually form. u
re ed at a very low elevation, it increases
the size of the drops which com,, trom
e" higher levels. Tons, while Mr. Olaisher
was descending in a balloon, he passed I

tog, when the drope of rain were exceed.
jy ingly tine, covering his iote book like
pins points. Three increased in size on
approachig,, the earth, but more rapidly c
r when very near the earth.
As we are becoming a stock country
,nd a stock selling people it will interest
r- our farmers who raise cattle to informn
in them of the markets elsewhere.
In rtn. Louis the gross cattle of this
country would range in price $2 2393 30 i
I per 100 pounds stock asttle being sold 1
I by weight in New Orleans.
t Our farmers bad better put in goio
II crops of oats, barley and rye, in order to
t make up for the lost corn erop. We note
t that so are doing this but we hope c
s that the example will be followed by a
e all. Let as buy no corn nest year.
We append some useful hints to our
farmers from late exchanges:
II It is said that cedar boughs spread
aboat the ben house will keep lice of
fiwle.
" It is related of a Kentish farmer that
She condensed his practieal experience ilto
Sbisru!e : "Feed your land before it is
hungry, rest it before it is weary, and
weed it before it is foul." it
Hogs in pens should have plenty of
Schareal ones a week. and a handful of
wood ashes each in their feed as often, h
as a preventative for worms, of which
