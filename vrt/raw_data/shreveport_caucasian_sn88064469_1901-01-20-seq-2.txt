Lord Rosebery has once again set the
army thinking. His speech at Wolver
hampton is freely commented on by the
newspapers which on the whole thank
the liberal earl for his remarks, but wish
be had not been so candid. They are
hunoyed at being so frequently told of
late that England's foreign trade is suf
fering from American and German com
petition. Lord Rosebery did not supply
any conclusive answer to the question
bow was England to tight America and
Germany successfully in the war of
trade. and The Standard remarks that
if anything effectual is to be done the
leaders must abandon their meritorious
generalizations and apply themselves
closely to details of the problems on
which they are so fond of touching.
The Times also has a sly dig at the 1-ad

Mr. Cross' daughter realized what Wine of Cardu' had done for her when she .aid "It has saved
my life ". Menstrual irregularities never continue long without involving falling of the womb, leucor.
rhza, or some other dangerous malady which endangers life and happiness.
WINEo*CARDUI
is an emmenagogue which lays the foundation for a woman's health by regulating the menstrual flow.
Its beneficial result is felt almost immediately as the sharp, shooting, dragging and bearing-down pains
disappear directly. Then the organs are strengthened and a final cure is the result. Do you not
want such a cure as that ? Nine out of every ten are struggling through life with some burden
brought about by female troubles. You may be one of them. Throw the burden off ! Many women
besides Miss Cross have taken Wine of Cardui for relief and are well and happy to-day just as she is.
Try Wine of Cardui. All druggists sell $1.00 bottles. Do not accept a substitute.
