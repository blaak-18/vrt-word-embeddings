Perfectly Natural,
The largest, most intelligent and
most representative Populist con
vention ever held in this State,
met in Alexandria last week.
Large elements of strength had
been offered it from both old par
ties ; the basis had been laid for
gathering these elements into our
party and with a representative
ticket upon a broad, liberal, but
thor(ngly Populistic platform,
marching to victory in April.
That we didn't do it, is giving
Foster the only sound sleep he has
had since the Shreveport farce.
Why we didn't do it, is a ques
tion that is puzzling our enemies
as well as our friends.
If there is no goodl reason for
our failure to do the sensible thing
when it runs up in our path, then
we had better quit monkeying with
But we believe there was the
best resons in the world for our
convention not doing what it went
to Alexandria to do.
We believe also that every ob
servant member of that conven
tion knows what those reasons
were.
We beheve further, that it is the <
patriotic duty of every Populist <
who knows these things to tell
them to the world, in order that
hisparty sad its ause and him- 1
self - ay not have to bear a blame
thatdoes net sad should not at
taech to them.
We havetold st upon the street
e.anrs  d in the highways enj

wE ihll adl ertese it.
t-zs'ouibbhe omCoetease Ia Alezan- (
" i, Nov. Stb, lI8b, it was agreed I
y the aSters, Populists '
.. apeaama, that tIhn PNo$.

I·I· party mad head tbe.
leet froml namong the ranks of theS
several factions and their own
such a ticket as would he thorough

opposed to Fosterism; that the
campaign for this ticket was to Ih
conducted, especially in Nortl
Louisiana, and wherever (else th(
party was strong, through th(
People's party. its speakers and it:
press.
If this is not the substance anrc
spirit of that agreement, we wil
thank J. T. Howell, J. W. MlcFar
land, B. . W. Bailey, lion. A. Be
noit, I. J. Mills, Andrew Hero,
.Jr., or any of the other estimable
gentlemen present an(t palrtclipa
ting in that conference, to correct
us.
The only parties to this agree
ment who violatod it prior to th(
Convention, were the Sugar-plant
ers when they nominated the par
tial ticket at Hotel Royal, and had
samne presented to our conventior
for completion and indorsem,.nt at
Alexandria.
The Republicans kicked at this
unwarranted action of the Sugar.
planters, and the Populists paid no
attention to its until their conven.
tion in caucus at Alexandria dis.
covered that their heretofore trust
ed leader, MIr. A. B. Booth, favor
ed and urged the acceptan:'oeof the
Sugar-planters ticket, when they
promptly sat down on the propo
sition.
Mr. Booth, finding nine-tenthi
of the convention in favor of nom
mating Judge Gunby for Govern
or, as against Pugh, the Sugar
planter nominee, took a new
"tack" to defeat Judge Gunby and
land the Sungar-planter nominee.
Taking advantage of the confi
dence Populists had in him for hi:
3 year's service in the party, he
demanded that a "straight" Popt
list he placed at the head of our
ticket, and then actually begged
for the nomination for himself,
comparing his party service, his
shrewdness and his availability,
with that of Judge Gunby.
In the meantime, Judge Gunby
was begging his friends to not nom
inate him, and pledging his sup
port to our ticket.
As yet no man in the convention
doubted Mr. Booth's honesty and
sincerity, and though regretting
his inexplicable desire for the ofl
fice they gave him the nomination
in good faith, little dreaming that
it was Booth's intention to turn it
over to Pugh and the Sugar-plant
era a little later on.
But to their utter mortification
and surprise, before the ticket had
been hardly completed, they found
Booth begging such men as Gam
ble, Howell, Benoit and McFar
land, to assist himLin "preparing"
the 'convention to accept his re
signation from the head of the
ticket in order that a Sugar-plant
er might take his place. .
These gentlemen promptly ex
posed Booth's treachery to the
caucus, and the excitement was in
tense.
The caucus then tried to get Mr.
Booth's resignation, but not for the
purpose of filling his place with
Pubh, but Mr. Booth was too sharp
to come of the ticket unless he
could turn it over tothe Sugar-plant
ers to whom it seems he was under
obligation, and by whom it seems
he was and is controlled.
Failing to get him of the ticket
all those who knew. of Booth's
treachery began to res where
they had been nominated, and to
deoline when a nomination was of
fered them.
This was when Gamble resigned
from.. the lExecutive Committee
md the convention was in an ace
o'f to pisecs.
happy expedient ofilling the tick
et temporarily and empowering
the State Central Committee to fil
vasncies from resignations that
will cometo the Chairman in a few
if Mr. Booth remains on the
Mra Booth is now writing letters
t e tos of the Po~iUaspre. of
this 8tate almost begging for the
lormatiom that will give hiY m an

Our woik has been templmorrily
set back by the treachery of its
prol'essed friends and one of its
trusted leaders, but it has conme
out of the fray in full rank with
flying colors, and its enemies de
fe,ted, acvattered and puzzled.
The Su:gar-planter ticket is
knocked silly, and Mr. Booth's
namie will be hereafter a by word,
while tIhe great People's party will
march on in solid lphalanx to vie
tory in the endil.
These are some of the reasons
why the P'opulist c,\mvention at
Alexandria did the wisest and most
natural thing to do.
DecmaoraItic Primary.
The Democrats of this parish
nominatedl their parish ticket liat
Saturday, by a primary election.
In this primary it was necessary
to poll more V\tes than the Popu
lists polled last Oct., or else give
up the fight and acknowledge de
feat.
So "the briltles were pulled off"
and every conceivable method of
rettin r votes ais adopted.
Seven candidates for Sheriff were
held in the rare, and each one had
a few Populists friends who were
willing to help) him get the honor I
of the nomination, with the privi
le're retained of voting the 'olpn
list ticket in April.
Soime heeler down in ward S was
induced to write lion. M. R. ,Joy
ner, of ward 2, and urge him into
the race for 1Representative, partly
to beat U. P. P. reazeale, the anti
ring candidate, and partly to get 1
Populist votes in ward 2.
Populists were so hard plre-se,'
for their votes that, as our corres
pondlent from ward 5 relates, they
were permitted to go in and vote
their own ticket already noniina
ted, and their votes afterward gi\v
en to one of the imen who carmre out
ahead.
Our correslxpondent from wardl 10
shows how numbers of Populists
were induced to vote there, and
that said Populists will vote their
own ticket in April.
Not only did they vote, perhaps
(o00 Populists, but boys and tran
sient workmen and negroes.
itHre in ward one, where over
one fifth of the total vote was cast,
they voted nearly every boy in the
Normal School, regardless of his
age or politics, nearly every bioy
in town from 1I; years old up, and
all the transient workmen on the
Court-house and other public
workd.
Don't think we are joking or ex- 1
aggerating, we can prove what we
say.
We also believe that had there
been none of this illegal voting and I
tricks in the management, that the I
nominations for Representative and
Sherinff would have been a little
different. 1
But in the light of all that was
done to secure a big vote, the re
sult is a mere sham, and like the
party it reprsents--a hollow fraud.
The vote of the parish is as fol
lows:

That Blroncho Bucked.
At the great Hotel Royal meet
ing of Sugar-planters where they
named a ticket for we Pops to en
dorse, Mr. W. E. Howell, of La
fourche, said that Gov. Foster
rode into power on the shoulders
of the Populists, and he saw no
good reason why the planters
should not ride him out of pl'wer
on the same animal.
So after dully blindfolding him
through Chairman Booth, the sad
idle was tied on him at Alexandria,
and great Scott ! you ought to have
seen that Broncho buck. Puckette
picked up pieces for two dlays af
terward. Pugh said he was glad
of it, that he didn't want to ride
nohow.
The Broncho is still at large with
his weather eye open, and the
politicians are busy finding out
"where they are at."
Moral-Bronchos sometimes fol
low leaders, but every one of them
is a born leauder.
Bro. Booth lost his fight for fu
sion with the Sugar-planters by
keeping his plans to himself and
depending on "bossism" and de
ception to win it. He would have
lost in an open, fair fight, but he
would not have been disgraced as
well as defeated. -
We wanted to draw all the op
position to Foster into our party,
bringing enough Silver Democrats
in from our right to offset our
Sugar-planter allies from the left,
and thus "keep in the middle of
the road."
Cn Bro. Booth's plan of co-ope
rating with the Republicans alone,
we would be afraid of being undu
ly influenced by so large an ele
ment from one side only.
Never deceive the people in what
you are trying to do, Bro. Booth,
and they will forgive you when you
go wrong. For your Alexandria
mistakes, they never can.
There is no doubt of one thing-
the Populists who are here to at
tend the State Convention of their
iparty, are honest as well as earnest
men. Like "hard shell" Bap
tists, they have faith in their prin
ciples, and the torture of the rack
could change but very few of them.
