•-> ALL AMERICANS SHOULD KNOW LAWS GOVERNING RESPECT TO NATIONAL FLAG <-*
The Etiquette of the Stars and Stripes
as Adopted by Code Conference 1923
Klansmen, kn< w the etiquette due
JOUT flag. On Flag Day, June 14,
1923, representatives of 68 organi*
nations met in Washington for a con
ference, called by and conducted un
4ler the auspices of the American
Legion, to draft an authentic code
jot flag etiquette. The code drafted
t»y that conference is printed on this
•nd the following pages, together
•with diagrams illustrating most of
4he rules. While the rules adopted by
fthe conference have no official gov
emment sanction, nevertheless they
represent the authoritative opinion
-of the principal patriotic bodies of
the United States and of Army and
Jfnvy experts, and are binding on all
4>f the organizations which took part
■in the gathering. The rules as given
below are from the final corrected
.draft of the code as brought out of
the conference. Klansmen will find
the rules and diagrams worth calling
to the notice of school pupils and cit
izens generally. Every American
should know them.
There are certain fundamental
guies of heraldry which, if under
stood generaly, would indicate the
S roper method of displaying the
ag. The matter becomes a very
taimple one if it is kept in mind that
the National Flag represents the liv
ing country and is itself considered
.as a living thing. The union of the
is the henor point; the right
arm is the sword arm, and therefore
the point of danger and hence the
plaee of honor.
1. The flag should be displayed
.only from sunrise to sunset, or be
tween such hours as may be desig
oated by proper authority. It should
be displayed on national and state
feolidays and on historic and special
.occasion. The flag should always
fee hoisted briskly and lowered
.slowly and ceremoniously.
2. When carried in a procession
•with another flag or flags, the flag
.of the United States should be
on the marching right, i. e.,
the flag’s own right, or when there
in a line of other flags the flag of the
United States may be in front of the
center of that line.
I When displayed with another
/lag against a wail from crossed
staffs, the flag of the United States
ahould be on the right, the flag’s
awn right, and its staff should be
In front of the staff of the other flag.
4. When a number of flags are
Souped and displayed from staffs,
e flag of the United States should
fee in the center or at the highest
point of ths group.

5. When flags of states and cities
or pennants of societies are flown on
ths same halyard with ths flag of ths
United States, the national flag
should always be at the peak. When
flown from adjacent staffs the flag
of the United States should bs
hoisted first. No flag or pennant
should be placed above or to ths
right of the flag of the United States.
6. When flags of two or mors
nations are displayed they should bs
flown from separate staffs of ths
sams height and the flags should be
of approximately equal size. (Inter
national usage forbids the display of
the flag of one nation above that of
another nation in time of peace.)
7. When the flag is displayed
from a staff projecting horizontally
or at an angle from the window sill,
balcony, or front of building, the
union of the flag should go clear to
the head of the staff unless the flag
is at half mast.
8. When the flag of the United
States is displayed in a manner other
than by being flown from a staff it
should be displayed flat, whether
indoors or out. When displayed
either horizontally or vertically
against a wall, the union should be
uppermost and to the flag’s own
ngnt, i. e., to the observer’s left.
When displayed in a window it
should be displayed the same way,
that is, with the union or blue field
to the left of the observer in the
street. When festoons, rosettes, or
drapings of blue, white, and red are
deeired, lunting should be used, but
never the flag.
9. When displayed over the mid
dle of the street., as between build
ings, the flag of he United States
should be suspend*, vertically with
the union to the north in an east
and west street or to the east In a
north and south street.
10. When used on a speaker’s
platform, the flag should be dis
played above and behind the
speaker. It should never be used to
cover the speaker’s desk nor to
drape over the front of the platform.
If flown from a staff it should be on
the speaker’s right.
11. When used in unveiling a
statue or monument, the flag should
not be allowed to fall to the ground
but should be carried aloft to wave
out, forming a distinctive feature
during the remainder of the cere
mony.
12. When flown at half staff, the
flag is first hoisted to the peak and
then lowered to the half staff posi
tion, but before lowering the flag
for the day it is raised again to the
peak. On Decoration Day, May 30,
the flag is displayed at naif staff
from sunrise until noon and at full
staff from noon until sunset, for the
nation lives and the flag is the sym
bol of the living nation.
13. When used to cover a casket
the flag should be placed so that the
union is at the head and over the
left shoulder. The flag should not
be lowered into the grave nor
allowed to touch the ground. The
casket should be carried foot first.
14. When the flag is displayed in
church it should be from a staff
placed on the congregation’s right
as they face the clergymen. The
service flag, the state flag, or other
flag should be at the left of the con
gregation. If in the chancal. the
lag of the United States should bo
||
placed on the clergyman's right as
He faces the congregation and other
flags on his left.
16. When the flag is in such s
condition that it is no longer a
fitting emblem for display it ahould
not be cast aside or used in any way
that might be viewed as disrespectful
to the national colors, hut should be
destroyed as a whole, privately,
preferably by burning or by some
other method in harmony with the
reverence and respect we owe to the
emblem representing our country.
Cautions
1. Do not permit disrespect to be
shown to the flag of the United
States.
2. Do not dip the flag of the
United States to any person or any
thing. The regimental color, state
flag, organization or institutional
flag will render this honor.
3. Do not display the flag of the
United States with the union down
except as a signal of distress.
4. Do not place any other flag or
pennant above or to the right of the
flag of the United States.

United States touch the ground or
trail in the water.

blem of any kind on or above the
flag of the United States.

8. Do not fasten the flag in such
manner as will permit it to be easily
torn.
9. Do not drape the flag over the

or of a railroad train or boat. When

float in a parade except from a staff.

kind upon the flag.

form of advertising nor fasten an
advertising sign to a pole frem

THE SALUTE TO THE FLAG
During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is
passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag,
stand at attention and salute. Those present in uniform should render the
right-hand salute. When not in uniform, men should remove the headdress
with the right hand and hold it at the left shoulder. Women should salute
by placing the right hand over the heart. The salute to the flag in the mov
ing column is rendered at the moment the flag passes.
When the national Anthem is played those present in uniform should
salute at the first note of the anthem, retaining this position until the last
note of the anthem. When not in uniform, men should remove the head
dress and hold it as in the salute to the flag. Women should render the
salute as to the flag. When there is no flag displayed, all should face
toward the music.
