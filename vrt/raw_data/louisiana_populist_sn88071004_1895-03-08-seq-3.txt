The Way To Do It.
Seven hundred thousand men
were induced to change their votes
to the party of progress inl the last
two years by reading. That means
forty converted each hour, day and
night. There were probably as
many convinced, but wanted a fi.
nal kick at the corrupt rarcass of
Democracy. Reading did it. Keep
that in mind. A good reform pa
per going into your family the next
year will (convert nine out of :a pi5
ril.ºeen. t The onily reasonl we didl
not git seven mnillioins instead (Pt
one-tenth that number was beause
the voters did not have anything
on our side to read-our voters be.
ing too loor to pay for the plapers.
With this increased. vote will come
inereased means of propogauda
work. Most of the converts fnr
1896 will be made in next year be
fore the boodlers of capitalism get
hold of the minds of the voters. If
you want to carry the county com.
mence now to put a paper in the
hands ot each workingman. Teach
him how to be free, and he will
gladly do his part. Wait until the
next cap:aign is on andi you'll
have the same old story. Go to
work now systematically.-Facts
and Figures.
Yes, we all get discouraged at
the times, and it takes philoso
phizinr to spur us on. We have
really everything to feel elated
over when we considter that only a
few years ago there were few men
in the nation who knew anything
about the philosophy of money or
land of menopoly. Today there
are hundreds of thousands. The
nature of these things is being
made plainer and simpler each day.
There are thousands of different
books and pamphlets and paper
and speakers. The people are
learning and learning rapidly.
Men are putting their soul into this
education as they did in fighting
the British in 1776. Old men,
who have only a few years to live
at most, write me they will die
contented if the people can be
brought to see the treachery of
the okl parties by next year. Men
are soliciting subscribers who are
virtually on the ragged edge of
starvation. There is no failure in
a movement that enlists this kind
of adherents. No matter if no re
form can be had now and the plu
tocrats seem on the highest wave of
power, the education is broadening
and will be irresistable when it
gets chrystalized. Keep your
mind on the future and keep at
work.-Facts and Figures.
Day by day the claim that rail
roads shaldberun.by the gov
ernment is being aceentuated by
actual tests. The northwestern
railroad recentl fell into theands
of the state o Georgia, being
ahandoned by the owners as worth
hs The state having uauateed
the bonds, took the roaland open
edit. The result was that last 1
year the road pai all o~era
peos iptUe on te bod
tnrned SiS,00 into the state treas
ury. Let the Ovi~erameat take
thewhm d do like
But you see for the government
to tabe our railroads and operate
them in thi interest of the people
and make money enough to pay all
tamo, would be paternaMlism, ad
we folkn an't stand patralm ,

The National Watchman is seri
ously in error if it thinks it can
concentrate the educational efforts
of the People's party on the finance
to the exclusion of other planks.
Nor does it become that paper to
speak disparingly of socialism for
fear of scaring a few ignorant mon
ey-bags out of the party. The
Omaha platform, as far as it goes,
is socialistic, and it should have
a chairman who understands that
fact. That document demands the
socialization of money, the social
ization of the railroads and tele
graph, and, while the phraseology
is ambiguous, if it demands any
thing. demands the socialiaation of
the land. To boast that the nation
al chairman is not a socialihst is
simply to say that he is not in ac
cord with the platform. If he is
in accord with the spirit of that
document he is socialistic. The
time has past to be afraid of of
fending those who do not know
what the theory of the co-operative
commonwealth means. The peo
ple are not going to get any relief
on the money problem, nor any
other relief until it is gained by the
power of overwhelming numbers.
Financial "relief," leaving to the
monopolies the control of the rail
roads, lands, factories and shops
would be barren. Every member
of the party has a right to fight in
that division which he can do the
most elective work, but when he
begins to insist that all must fight
on the lines he has laid out and
leave the rest of the field for the
enemy, I for one kick.
These one-eyed money members
will find when they meet in the
next national convention that the
people have been studying the in
dusiial problems and that the
pla m will be broadened rather
than narroed. It ought to
demand the "public ownership of
all monoplies," and it will gain by
so doing.- Coming Nation,
