At first the fruits of their latbo
were small, int they were sure. Thiey c
became econonmical, aud struggled on
with perseverancre. The only thing TI
they had to complain of was the veri
onerous taxation they were subjectd CU
to through the corrupt, or loose, or i
ixtravagant adlministraton of their eve
public atitirs by oftlicials m hom they -
had no voice in selectig. This was
the only cause of or plaint they hauld.
They accepted the situation they
found themselves placed in at the
close of the .'ar-the confiscation of
their propwrty down even to ther last
mule ; tihey yielded to this without a
iiin uleur, conitet to enter the tields of
inlustry and woi k out their own it
demlption from pleoverty. They ae
cepted, too the burden of ('ar ying

C'ol. Van Blnrerv y as t here is not a
ringle white Iman idle in the section 'T
ie visited. Even the ladies of the t
Sonthl-tlose who, prior to the wat di
were surroundtd w ithi wealth and all c
its luxunies- are engaged in labors of pin
various kinds. One lady, whose hts
bandit had large possessions, but of
which he was stripped entirely, heing r
a good hounsewife, set up n little bread eta
and roll bakery. She kneaded the it'
dough herself and attended to its i
sale and distribution, and now she Pr
has quite a business emplloying many
hands. Another case was that of a
man of wealth whose last prop-a
mule-was taken from him and lie
was left without the shadow of a
semblance even of the wherewitli to
feed himself and family. lie went at
work driving a team, hauling brick.
There were hundreds of incidents of
this kind, the Colonel says, and it
did his heart good to see with what a
lively, good natured spirit these men
turned their harndts to anything which
was honorable and honest to helpC
themselves.
lie has full faith in their solving
the problem beforo them-whethler
the South can be mtade as prosperous
asit was in its palmny days. lie
thinks their redemption is nigh at F
hand. lie says they are particuharly
courteors to their Northern brothers
who ncome to them in kindness arid
honesty-who will join them in indlus
try and enterprise. They give a
hearty welcome to such. They iin
rite and urge the mivestment of cap
ial in the productiveness of their
soil, full and abiding fai Lh in which
they have. They know better than
any one eleo of what it is capable!
They frankly admit that the slave
;,bur never did justice to it, and that
they would never select that labor
lhemicselves. It was three at hand,
a part anid parcel of their estates and
had to be ased the same as other ac
:eisories.
PRESENT BUOYANCY. ii
At the present mnotent they are es- i
pecially in buoyant spirits, as they G
see opportunity offered them of se- I"
lecting their officials themselves, by P
wlhich they hope to reduce the drain u
apwo their intcomes by heavy taxation,
which they have suflered now for over
ten years. This, Col, Van lhren
anye, was one of the nmost promising
tigis he witoessed; for nio matter
how hard one may work, if he can
see no prospect of gain before him rhe
iananot put mich heart in his work.
KILLED BY THE 8TING OF A
BEE.-A distressing event occur
red at Lydney on Friday week,11
and was the subject of a Coroner's
inquiry, on the following day, viz:
the death of tHlenry Larkham, sen., t
a retired farmer, from the sting of a
a bee. It appeared from the ev
idence given before MIr. F. Carter,
Divisional Coroner, that about a
quarter to five o'clock ot the day
named Mr. Larkham was in his
son's garden, and, oan lassig in
front of the beehives, received a
sting uap n the templen. The old
gentleman at once returned to the
~oase, and asked a young manr
damed Lloyd to fetch the blue-bag
hich was done, anid the liquid
blue was applied. hloyd likewise,
at the request of Larkham, took
an egg from his pocket which he
had gathered from a nest. Upon
sitting dowl in the yard Mr. Lark- .
harn had ftinted, and was hathed 8
with vinegar and water, This,
however proved a powerless res
torative, death supervening with- .1
ir a rquarter of an hour after the i
sting. Dr. Gimblett was called at
the inquiry, and stated that he
lad been seat for, but deceased
died before he could reach the
house. IIe had since examined
ilhe body, and found a wound
upon the right temple inflicted by a
• be'. This it was which causep
,h'atb. Ulpon this testimony the
Sr reutrnUled their verdict. t
