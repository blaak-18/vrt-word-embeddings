YERBA SANTA
The “Holy Herb” of the In
dians and the Mission Fathers of
the West, is a very pretty ever
green plant, which grows in most
inaccessible places in the moun
tains of California and Northern
Mexico. The leaves are dark
green, completely varnished by a
copious coating of resin. This
resinous compound is a marvelous
cure for coughs, colds, bronchitis
and consumption. In many places,
the plant is known as “Consump
tives’ Weed”, “Mountain Balm”,
or, among the Mexicans, “Yerba
Santa”. Made into a hot tea, it
is palatable, warms quicker than
whisky, and is absolutely harm
less. It will cure the obstinate
cases of throat and lung trouble;
and it is a specific in intestinal
disorders.
Send me a silver dime, or ten
cents in stamps, and I will mail
you a sample of the “Holy Herb”,
which at one time saved my life.
It can not hurt you, and if you
have a cough, cold, bronchitis, or
even pneumonia, it will cure you.

ISN’T IT TIME FOR THE UNION
TO WAKE?
To the Union Men of Georgia.
Brethren, why is it that we hear
such a “fuss” and see nothing “do
ing?”
Why do not some of the members
with “backbone” get to work right?
Is it because they are afraid, or is it
because they are like I am—think it
is the other business? This
will do no longer. Something must
be done, and that at once, if we
would save this our best friend, the
“Union.”
I have the plan if I can get the
following to back me up. We could
accomplish wonders if we would only
get at the work in a systematic way.
Now, if you will stick to the Union
and for the right thing, talk the mat
ter up in your local and county un
ions, and send the following message
to The Jeffersonian;
“We, Local Union, (give name and
number and secretary’s name and
address.) Or, we, County Union
(here give name and address of coun
ty secretary). Will stand for the
right and good of the Union.”
We know that The Jeffersonian is
not a Union paper, but we can use its
columns, and it stands for a fair,
clean deal.
Now if we get enough locals and
counties to stand together by sending
in the above report, we will write you
a personal letter and explain some
things to you that we dare not put in
the columns of any newspaper, even a
Union paper, for we do not wish to
divulge any secret of our institution.
But we can give you the goods in per
sonal correspondence.
In my last letter I said something
about the “Union Cotton Company”
at Macon, and by mistake they got it
collar
Why was it that at the last State
Union the delegates did not investi
gate the shortage shown in the min
utes of the previous State Union?
Why did J. T. Lee find so much
fault with Brother W. W. Webb as
president of the Consolidated Ware
house Company until he resigned, and
then claim that Brother Webb was on
the right track ?
Why did the Union City ring find
fault with R. E. Barfield as manager
of the Savannah office of the Consoli
dated Warehouse Company, until
Brother Webb resigned, and then do
all that they could to get Brother
Barfield to hold the office on?
Why was the Augusta office open
ed without the knowledge or con
sent of Brother Webb, who was
president at that time?
Think, brethren, think, and then
act, and act with a vim. Say that
our Union will and must live.
Do not be discouraged. We have
good men to put at the helm. We
have honest men to rule. We have
men who will not be led into
schemes of graft. We have men
who will not get the bighead and
die or kill the Union if you put them
in office.
Take courage, be of good cheer,
and we will win after all.
Let us hear from you. The vic
tory is yours if you will hold out to
the end.
Remember that I am in the fight
for the right.
Why does not J. T. Lee resign,
and not be put out?
We think that if Brother Lee had
the interest of the Union at heart,
as he claims to have, that he would
resign after there has arisen such a
controversy.
Brother Lee, let us have the goods,
and we ought to have them, or get
out of the way and let some other
man have a whack at it.
We are in earnest, and ask you
in the interest of the Union to get
right or get out of the way.
If you do not get out, we will have
to put you out. This is plain, but
we need plain folks and plain talk.
Boys, rally to the cause of the
Union. Put your shoulder to the
wheel. Fraternally yours,
A UNION MAN.

WATCH YOUR FARM PAPER.
When you see in some farm paper
an editorial or article in favor of the
Ship Subsidy steal, please remember
that the Farmers’ National Congress,
the National Grange, and every State
Grange, have invariably and most
emphatically denounced that steal;
and that the Merchant Marine
League, that is back of the Ship Sub
sidy steal, is spending money very
freely.
We don’t believe that any real
farm paper can be bought. We do
not know any editor of a farm paper
that, in our opinion, can be bought.
However, it is just as well to look
out for articles or credentials in fa
for of Ship Subsidy.
By the way, if a Ship Subsidy is
the best way and the only way to
build up a Merchant Marine, why is
it that France, which pays the heavi
est subsidies, can scarcely increase
its Merchant Marine, while Germany,
which pays the least subsidies of any
nation that pays any, is building up
its Merchant Marine at a faster rate
than any other nation? lllinois

DOING GOOD WORK.
Kuhn’s Rheumatic Remedy, the
advertisement of which, “Drive At
Rheumatism,” appears in this issue,
is doing a very good work, in curing
Rheumatism, judging by the letters
in the advertisement from cured
former sufferers. This remedy was
first offered in 1893, over sixteen
years ago-; and has gained a splendid
lepmation as a cure for Rheuma
tism. This Company has been ad
vertising in this paper for a long
time, and many of our readers have
used and praise their remedy. These
readers got a free bottle through the
offer in the advertisement, which you
should do if you have Rheumatism.
The Company is doing a big business,
is reliable and will do just what they
say in their advertisement.
PLAIN TRUTH
A MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 32 PAGES
By J. A. SCARBORO,
A Son of Georgia, Minister and
Student.
This Magazine is digging up and
exposing corruption and graft in
“Missions”. Its Editor has studied
the subject fifteen years, published
two books on the subject and knows
what he is doing. Dr. J. N. Hall,
late Editor of the Baptist Flag, the
most widely circulated Baptist pa
per in the South, with whom Scar
boro was associated as Editor of
that paper, said of him: “J. A. Scar
boro is the best informed man on
missions in America.” The cham
pions of the present system have
declined to meet him in both press
and on rostrum. His Magazine is
lull of facts, evidence and arg’u
ments which can not be refuted. He
is Treasurer of the General Asso
ciation of Baptist Churches, and has
the confidence and enjoys the en
dorsement of his brethren. He is
Pastor of one of the best churches
in the land and just in his prime
and in the thickest of the battle for
truth and righteousness.
