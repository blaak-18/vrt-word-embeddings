Duty of U. S. Supervisors.
XmW(,T FROM r ST.ATUTFr. OF 1871, 28Th
FEBRUARY.
Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the san
pervisors of election, appointed4 under
this act, and they and eachi of them are
hereby authorized and required:
1. To attend at all times and places
fixed for the registration of voters, who,
being registered, would be entitled to
vote for a Representative or delegate in
Congress; atnd
2. To challat ge any person offering to
register.
:;. To attend at all times and places
when the names of registered voters may
lbemarked for challenge, and to cause
such names registered as they shall deem
proper to be so marked.
4. To make, wheln required, the list, or
either of them, provided for in section
thirteen of this act, and verify the same;
anldl
5. Upon any occasion, and at any time
when in attendance under the provis
ions of this act, to personally inspect
and scrutinize such registry, and for pur
poses of identification to affix their or
his signature to each and every page of
the original list, and of each and every
copy of any asuh list of registered voters,
at such times, upon each day when any
name may or shall be received, entered,
or registered, and in snch manner as will,
in their or his judgment, detect and ex
pose the improper or wrongfuil removal
therefrom, or addition thereto, in any
way, of any name or names."
THi DUTY OF SUEPZVISORS.-The
Democratic and Conservative Super
visors of Registration have important
functions to perform.
1. They must be present at the
opening and closing of the office, and
lie certain to check off the last regist
ered voter, so as to prevent any ad
dition in the night time.
2. They must keep a fist of all the
registered voters as fast as they are
being registered on the books, and
this list must mention: 1st, the name,
2d, the age, 3d, the color, 4th, the
residence, including name of street
and number of hIonp.
:3. As soon as they qualify and en
ter the office, they must make out a
list of all those previously registered,
as above stated.
4. When a voter is refused registra
tion his name and residence must be
taken down.
The above should be submitted
every day. to the Parish Committee,
to be usel to ferret out any frauds
committed.
We believe this is being tattended
to with us, and we cannot be too par
ticular in our watch of these scamps.
"Eternal vigilance is the price of liber
ty."
REMEMBER YOUR FRIENDS AND
MARK YOUR ExaMiES.-There should
be kept and carefully preserved for
future reference, a Black List, or book
of Remembrance, in every parish,
wherein should be inscribed the names
of those white men, who in this emer
geoncy, prove recreant to the instincts
and duties of race, and east their lot
with the African. The infamous re
cord should be as conspicuous for all
time tocome as the pictures of noto
rious criminals in the Rogues' Galle
ries of large cities. These men must
not be forgotten. Let their names
be written in the Black List with a
pen of adamant, that they and all
who deseend from their loins, to the
fourth generation, may be Pariahs,
forever cast out from all association
with the Caucasian race. Letall who
adher'to the aegro party in this
political contest b~ reckoed ssegroe,
and treated as scb. Let the Black
List for St. Mary be opened. Let the
names of those who pant for immor
tal infamy be enrolled.--St. Mary En
terprise.
We say let the ,LAcK LEs for
Natchitodche be ote opened, and en
roll the names of those who are so i
famous as to betray the nreda traiit

Platform of the White People's
Party.
We, the white people of Louisiana, em
bracing the Democratic Party, the Con
servative Party, the White Man's Party,
the Liberal Party, the Reform Party and
all others opposed to the Kellogg usur
pation do solemnly resolve and declare:
1. That the governmnent now existing
in Louisiana originated in, and has been
mnaintained by force and fraud, in opplo
sition to the will of a largo majority of
the voters of the State; in opposition to
the principles of the Constitution of the
United States and in violation, of every
principle of justice and liberty.
2' That the dominant faction of the
Radical party in this State has, by false
and fraudulent representations, inflamed
the passions and prejudices of the ne
groes, as arace, against the whites, and
as thereby made it neceessary for the
white people to unite and act together in
self-defense and the preservation of white
civilization.
3. That the rights of all men under the
Constitution and laws of the land must
be respected and preserved inviolate, it
respective of race, color or previous con -
dition, but we deny that Congress can
Constitutionally enact laws to forme the
two races into social union or equality.
4. That the white people of Louisiana
have no desire to deprive the epiored
people of any rights to which they are en
titled, but we are convinced that the re
forms imperatively demanded, can be
effected only by electing to office white
men of known capacity and integrity,
and we believe that large numbers of
colored citizens will vote with us to se
cure a government which must be bene
ticial alike to both races.
5. That we disclaim earnestly any in
tention of carrying, or attempting to car
ry, the approaching election by violence,
and that charges to this effect emanating
from our Radical enemies, are without
foundation and are falsely made for the
purpose ofobtaluing the aid of the mil
itary force of the United States in order
to over-awe the people, perpetuate the
existing usurpation anmd subvert the true
principles of the government.
6. That W. P. Kellogg is a mere usurp
er and we denounce hbn as such, that his
Igovernment is arbitrary, unjust and op
pressive; and that it can mantain it
self only through Federal interference.
2. That the election and registration
Slaws under which this election is being
conducted were intended to perpetuate
the usurpation by depriving the people
and especially our naturalized citizens of
an opportunity to register and vote, but
we announce, distinctly, that it is the
determination of the people to have a
fair and free electiohi and to see that the
result is not changed by fraud or violence.
8. That we extend to all our race in
every clime the right hand of fellowship
and a cordial invitation to come and set
tle among us, and unite their destinies
with ours.
9. That while we are in favor of meet
ing punctually the payment of the legit
imate debt of Louisiana, we are immo
vably opposed to the recogneitionsle issned
in the name of the State, and we pledge
ourselves to make a searching investiga
Stion in the matter.
SWe advise our people to vote against
i the amendments to the Constitution pro
.posed by the usurping Legislature and
Spledge ourselves on the restoration of the
vemrment to honest hands,.to provide
orthe syment of all honest indebted
nere of the State

The World's Tavorite.
THE SALES of the, INGER last year
was the greatest ever attained for
any Sewing Machine in a year, and was
nearly doublb the sales of its highest
comlpetitor, as may be seen by reference
to the account of sales for 1873, from
sworn returns made to the owners of the
Sewing Machine Patents-from which
statistics we select the five leading ma
chines, viz:
The Singer sold 232,444
" Wheeler & Wilson, " 119,190
" Domestic, " 40,114
" Grover & Baker, " 36,176
i" Weed, " 21,769
It will be observed that the difference
in favor of the SINGER, is tlhe enormous
amount of 113,254 over the lnughest com
petitor. This result has been obtained
after years of competition.
We submit to an interested public if It
is claiming too much to -say-the Singer
is thi most popular Sewing Machine in
the world.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in thisecomtry, from its
never containing anything that would
oftiend the feelings of any one, either in
a religions or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
objection front the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of then, flnctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic meritof the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how. to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing industry anq enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of Tun
OLDEST AND THE BEST of Family Story
Papers.
