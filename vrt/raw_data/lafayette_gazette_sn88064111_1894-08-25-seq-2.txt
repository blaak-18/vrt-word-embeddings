General Wade Hampton, it is
said, is aging fast. He is very
gray, his eyesight is failing and he
hobbles around on one leg. But
;._when he is in the saddle, it is said,
he undergoes a lightning-like
-.transformation and becomes the
ideal cavalryman.
Jo-hn riincy Ada'ns, great grand
son of President John Adams,
grandson of President John Quincy
Adams and son of Charles Francis
Adeains, minister to England during
the civil war, died at his home in
Massachusetts a few days ago. He
was, .as he said himself, a man
*'wfthout a party" and never sought
political preferment.
Wool, lumber, salt, binding
toine, cotton and grain bagging,
cotton ties, plows harrows, har
vesters, reapers, drills, mowers,
Slorserakes and cotton gins have
been relieved of all duty. It seems
to us that the farmer will be
ibenefited by the abolition of the
- duty on these indispensable articles
' of farm work. We shall see.
The Senatorial dignity we hear
:so amch about must have received
4i C.severe shock when the New York

Ksleatf l ew Orfrmu. was engaged 5
for the tes s d, tbe 4gfnase, said r
the trial wilt ran ; " one of tie
most celebratedi - f the history of
that, efty. That the 'crime was
dearly pgoved '.against .the culprit
no one will dispute, and the verdict
is universially adtmitted to be a just t
and impartial one.- -.It is expected f
that this conviction is the first step
toward the establishment of man hon
est government i'~Elhe Cresent city.
Tne fight is now on betwieen the
people and the artistic boodler and
blackmailer, and we hope that the
last of such characters will be swept
away by the hands of the law from
the City Hall,where it is said by the
press, they have been artfully and
profitably plying tiheir nefarious and
disgraceful business for several years.
By this time the-balance of the pic
turesque group of boodlers must be
trembling in their boots and whist
ling to keep up courage; but the
people have scaled the heights
ofi what was thought to be
the impregnable fortress of
municipal corruption, and we would
surmise that before many days the
slick and artful defenders will take
to their heels. The people have
learnt their power and no sensible
man entertains a doubt that the
bribe-takers will be totally routed.
SThe cohesive power of plunder is
great, but when that power is
I broken,.- the people may expect a
1 complete surrender or an absolute
coliapse.
Bribery is. the most dangerous of
crimes. Bribers and bribe-takers
call for no one to witness their vile
and contemptible transactions and
it is difficult to convict those who
are guilty of such a crime. As bad
as other crimes are, they are not as
far reaching in their effects and as
dangerous to society and govern
ment. Bribery poisons the very
fountain head of justice and grad
ually permeates and contaminates
the whole body politic if allowed to
go unchecked. It is getting to be
too common in this country, and
the only remedy against it is univer
sal condemnation of it by the peo
as the most infamous of all crimes,
s and a strict enforcement of the
r laws against bribers and bribe takers.
e It is charged that even the sacred
t precinct of the United Senate is
, not free from the wiles and machi
e nations of the briber. During the
i tariff debate Senator- Gorman and
one or two other senators were
openly charged with being the tools
of the sugar trust, and by their votes
the tariff' bill was badly crippled and
fortunes were lost to several Ameri
can industries. New York City has
also lately given a sad spectacle of
e the depth ot its political corruption.
A halt must be called, or else
t the people will lose confidence in
their officers and general demoral
ization will be the consequence.
It to be wished that New Orleans
will turn a new leaf and at the next
election choose honest men to ad
' mister her affairs, and the political
e filth which has been brooding over
s her will disappear in the sunlight of
a new and happier day, and hence
e forth she will move forward and
Stake her position as the metropolis
of the South.
r The Rice Crop.
SMessrs. Talmage's sons say in
k their last bulletin:
Louisiana--Considerable uncertainty as
Sto the outcome of crop still exists in this,
r the "banner State." The area planted, to
gether with improved methods of culture
would, under favorable conditions, have
assured a crop of two million sacks. At
this date the crop is generally made but
with delayed planting and scanty supplies
t of moisture no inconsiderable part of the
growth is late and still subject to other than
- ordinary contingencies. Wherever situated
along bayou, river or other streams, crops
are reasonably forward and in fine condition;
but those dependent on rainfall are strug
gling for life with varying promise as to
outcome. The only hope for the latter is
e favorable winds, proper temperature, plenty
of rain at intervals from now on, and a late
] Fall; faliling this happy combinatiou the
results, wlR be scason worth gathering- The
Simmediate prospects are encouraging, giving

According to the medical bill passed at
the last session of the legislature, all women
practicing midwifery are required to register a
as such before the medical board appointed
by Gov. Foster, within go days if they wish
to continue as such; otherwise they will have
to pass an examination before said board,
which should be almost impossible for some a
owing to the rigid examination they would a
have to stand up to. It would therefore c
be advisable for them to inquire at once of s
Gov. Foster where and to whom to send
their application.-Theoda Independent. t

The question of artesian wells in this sec
tion is one of interest to all our people and
it is surprising that more extensive tests and s
experiments have not been made in this J
direction. Could wells be sunk that would
furnish a sufficient water supply for irriga
tion purposes, they would be of inestimable
value to those planters who are situated
remote from the bayous. Artesian wells
would of course be the ideal way for supply
ing the rice with water, but though a flow
ing well may not be obtained and a pump
be necessary, it would still be of estimable
value to the rice interests. We hope to see
some extensive experimenting done this fall I
and winter in this parish, and are inclined a
to the belief that success will follow.
Madison Romaine has arranged to sink ai
well at once on his farm east of the Garland ]
ranch, in Vermilion parish, and we await I
the result of his labors with interest.-Crow

Seatator Cameron's Poker Games.
Mr. Cameron, who is so serious
and unapproachable at almost all
times in public, is one of the gayest
of men in the private circles of his i
own choosing, and. his house has
been the, scene of some of the
liveliest poker playing known in
Washington. He is also one of the
senatorial circle which meets at a
private hotel there and plays a stiff
game two or three times a week.
One or two men in the game are too
poor to play poker. Butler, of
South Carolina, is one of those poor
poker players-poor in more senses
than one. Vest, of Missouri, who is
one of the liveliest of the boys when
on a senatorial spree and one of
the most crabbed and disagreeable
of men at all other times, is another
of the poker crowd. Vest lived for
many years in a little frame cottage
on Capital Hill. with the sergeant
at-arms of the senate, and he was
so poor he said that he could not af
ford to keep house in Washington.
But Vest could not afford to play
~5o limit and lose. Cameron has
always had more money than he
could spend. Of course he could
not give money to his friends, Vest
and Butler; but, with his knowledge
t of the stock market (second only to
- that of Senator Quay) he could
I give them points of value and put
r them into deals which he knew
would be profitable. The result
was to make good the money these
men had lost at poker and to keep
i them in the game. And as Vest is
a good story-teller and Butler al
ways a jovial companion, Mr. Cam
eron found his reward in their
society.-Titusvjlle (Pa.) Herald.
