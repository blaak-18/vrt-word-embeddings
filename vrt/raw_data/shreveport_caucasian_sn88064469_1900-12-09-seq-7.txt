ral Charles P. Eagan, c:,nm:ssary gi ii

tence and restored him to a status off
dnty with a statien in this city. This
order was immnediately followed by one
issued by General Miles announcing
that General Eagan had been placed on
the retired list on his own application
after 3G years service.
Weston to Bi Promoted.
Washington, Dtc. 7.-The vacancy
created by the retirement of Brigadier
General E igan will enable the president
to carry out his purpose of of appointing
Colonel John E. Weston assistant com
missary general of subsistence, to be
commissary general. Lieutenant Colonel
Weston served wiih distinction in a
Kentucky regiment of the volunteer
army in the civil war, he was made a
brigadier general of volunteer and served
with distinction in the Santiago cam
paign.
Appointed Assoeiate Justice.
Washington, Dec. 7.-The nomination
of Daniel H. McMillan to be associate
justice of the supreme court of New
Mexico bus been sent to the senate in
place of Silas Alexander, who by some
inadvertence was named for the place
earlier in the week.
Reveaj Red uetiem Bill.
Washington, tDec. 7.-The ways s.d
means committee voted to report the
revenue reduction bill as introduced
with an amendment making the act
take effect at its passage instead of 80
days thereafter. All substitutes and
amendments by the minority were de
feated- -6 to 9.
May IMkes a Protest.
Washington, Dec. 7. -The state de
partment has received a formal protest
from R. H. May, the American engineer
who was forcibly detained in Ouatamala
against the proceedings of the ffl5oial
there.
Bill fer Metre System..
Washington, Dec. 7.-The bill of Rep
resentative Shafroth of Ool~ rdo, for the
adoption of the metric system by the
United States, has been referred to the
house committee on weights and
measureas.
A Rc of 34 .t.pe.
When a clock goes wrong to the gov
ernment building. It runs on ragtime ab
til the Janitor of the builking reports to
the assistant engineer, the assistant to
the chief engineer and the engineer to
the custodian. Then a letter is written
to the custodian of all the government
stone buildings in Washington. It pass
es down through department after de.
partment and becomes a part of a dusty
pile of official documents which are serl
occasionally turned over to the chlef
clerk of some department and distributed
among the overworked clerks. In the
fullness of time, while the clock either
refuses to run at all or runs on any old
time, a report comes back to Detroit, is
received by the custodian and goes down
the line whence it came. Finally the
Janitor sends for a jeweler.
In the case of two clocks In Judge
Swan's office some months ago and the
process of official digestion of a request
for a 50 cent repair job two months pass
ed before the government order finally
reached the clockmaker. Three weeks
ago a clock In the office of District At
torney Gordon stopped because one of
the weights went wrong. It will cost 23
cents to fix the broken string, but no
one dares touch it." Meanwhile official
paper and time are being wasted in the
routine of consideration of so weighty a
problem and the office has no timepiece.
-Detroit JournaL
First AiS t tthe Injured.
The halue of teaching of first aid to the
injured is illustrated almost every day,
but in no ease more aptly than in that of
a brakeman on the Erie railroad who fell
from his train. A leg was eaut off by the
car wheels, but, with admirable presenct
of mind, the man constructed a tourni
quet with his handkerchief and knife
whereby he stopped the hemorrhage.
Even in this condition he built a fire in
order to warm himself and awaited the
next train, which he signaled. He was
taken aboard and to a hospital.
We trust that the time will come when
sohool t'hildren in the upper grades may
be taught so much of "applied physiolo
gy" as will enable them to act sensibly
in the case of the thousand emergencies
sure to take place in after life with them
selves or their fellows. It is strange that
almost all tay people "lose their heads"
in accidents and injuries and do precise
ly'what should not be done. This iespe
cially true when hemorrhage is present.
Many people either faint or are seised
with panic at the mere sight of blood, a
possible echo of primitive barbaric blood
rites and blood frenzies.
To supplant this loss of control by calm
and intelligent action according to the
ciracmstances and condition is one of the
duties we owe to the coming generations.

VIRGINIA IN LINE.
Proposes to Have a llslfranchlse Tests
for All Voters.
Richmond, Dec 6--Much interest is
shown in the negro, disfranchisement
question in this state, which is to como
before the constitutional convention
soon. Senator John W. Dauiel is draft
ing the provision, which it is believed
will stand bettr prospoct of successful
ly running the gauntlet of the court of
last resort than the "grandfather's"
clause of Louisiana and North Carolina.
Benator Daniels' proposition is to et
empt from the illiteracy c]ause all per.
sons from Virginia who served in any
war This would let in all illiterate ex
Confederates and Federal soldit'rs,white
and black The number of the two last
named classes will be significant. The
plan is based upon laws enacted by a
western state during the-civil war under
which all persons who volunteered in
the Federal army were given the right
of suffrage.

It li May, who once serve:d the gov
ermuieut ol .uate;ual:i as the contractor
for the (uatemala Nor'herrn railway,
was arre.t.dl at the gangway of the
s.:i:roner and thrown into prison on the
char-ge of attermptuing to leave the repub.
1he without having maid his debts.
The animosity oft he otsiciLls of the
Tittle republic against May Is probably
attrin taible to the foc: t.at Mr. Kenner,
the ib tish iiumipir, in the arblitration of
the case of It if. May, an American

The S; ill watt.r arrived at Port Barrios,
the chief eastern seaport of the republ
on Nov. 29, and was to have sailed that
afternoon. Mr. May's health for some
tim.' has been anything but good and he
arranged to make a visit to this country
for the necessary medical treatment.
Acting under the requirements of the
law of that country, he made the neces
sary arrangements for powers of attor0
ney, and these documents were to be
turned over to F. W. G. Fnqu:s,who was
to represent Mr. May and stand respon
sible for the debts of the r.,lway con
tractor. All these papers had been se
cured, together with a passport from the
command - of the port, but word was
doubtless sent to the capital that May
was about to leave and orders cacme from
the president to detain them.
As May walked out on the wharf to
the gangplank and startbd up to the
ship, a man in citizen's clothes stoprd
him. An officer of the army then c~e..
up and informed Mr. May that cders
had been issued to detain hinr. May
exhibited his passport, explaing tat
he had the documents acortdi . o t
