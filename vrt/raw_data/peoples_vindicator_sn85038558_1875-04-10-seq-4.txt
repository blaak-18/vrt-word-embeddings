Ptage Prepald by Publishers.
The unpreeedented euceee with which
th Times has met, since its establish
ment, is convincing evidence that the
S people of the West and South, fully ap
preeiate the efforts of a journal, which,
in addition to its enterprise as a news
paper, hasethe courage to boldly declare
and constantly maintain the principles
of its political faith.
The public Journal mostly deserving of
Demoeratic support is the one that, in
additiin to being a full and faithfld and
awtlstent advocate of Democratic prin
elples. A Democratic newspaper is the
Mnewspaper for Democrats to support, and
the idenometimes sought to be ionlca
ted by those who have au interest of their
own in doing so that the people must go
eoutide their party organ to "ind the
news," is absurd and irrational. There
isn. snort of incompatibility whatever
hbtfreen the political and non-political
:joutastlasltothe matter of news; many
of the papers now published throughout
tie eounltry, and especially valuable for
te amount and variety of their intel
Algenee, being also known for the ability
and earnestness with which they cham
pion their peculiar party views, Htence
all things else being equal, iris manif!st
ly the duty ofDI)emoerats to limit their
newspaper patronage to such as are of
their own way of thinking, and not to
squander their means on those that wage
eonstant warfare upon their established
envietionas.
It is our desire to see the Times in the
bhand of all I)emocrats, and every well
wisher of the Government thronghout
thi land,and in order thatflthis may be
rones,we are now offering the following
ktramordinary induqements to those who

WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion Amterican Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting filly as it flies, and showing up
the political andl social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as tilhe, ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the publici
demalnd, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its i
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous I
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to thrnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuekhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame. 1
In its literary departmeuts Wild Oats I
will, as it always has, stand alone and i
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squihs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on' the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the causeoof the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIIT
TERS " Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno=
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded p03
sessing the remarkable qualities of VYs
ROAR BITTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonie,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Dr.. WALK
ER's VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient. Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, i)iuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

especially those of the Mississippi,

Alabama; Mobile, Savannah. Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs. is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WtALKER'S V vIsAR
BITTERS, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy iuna
tions of the digestive organs.

dug up and carried oat of the system in a
short time by the usw of these Bitters..
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
larking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
moved. No s.vystem of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelminities will free the
system from worms like these Bitters.
]For FemnaleComplaints, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of

ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Titiated Blood
whenever you.flud its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; eleanse it when youen and it ob.
struected and sluggish in the reins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
