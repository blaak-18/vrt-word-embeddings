EAR SIR: —I would like the
privilege of making a reply
to your article entitled,
“Kind Words for the Social
ists”, in the Jeffersonian of
D
July 29th.
(1) I agree with you in all you
say about “Man”, except possibly the
statement that he is “selfish to the
very core”. I believe as a general
proposition that most men who are
reasonably well educated, and given
the power to make a certain, and
comfortable living, are essentially
generous.
(Answer: Unhappily, I must in
sist upon the general proposition
that men are selfish to the very core.
The generous are the exceptions, and
their very generosity is often fitful
and calculating. Self-interest gov
erns the common man, and all great
rulers have based their state-craft
upon that principle. For one man
like Alexander H. Stephens, Thom
as Jefferson or Peter Cooper, you
will find a million who are just sim
ply selfish, and a hundred thousand
who are abominally, brutally so. In
children at play, in grown-ups man
aging their business, in the human
hog on his travels, in the scrambles
for office, in the employer bearing
down upon employee, in the hired
man trying to get the better of the
boss, and, most of all, in the terrible
and unconscious selfishness of hus
bands in their demands upon their
wives, you will find illustrations of
what I mean. Only a young man,
generous and optimistic, would con
tend otherwise. In the Appeal to
Reason, July 31, Mr. Raoul will find
an editorial, beginning with the
words, “Yes, I am a Socialist because
1 am selfish”.)
(2) As to the common ownership
of land, I will cite you to the fact
that the “State” already holds the
final title in land. Should you or
any other land owner fail to pay your
taxes, your land would be promptly
taken away from you. In other
words, to put a strictly technical in
terpretation on the present laws, as
you do on our proposed laws, you
may now, at the present time, consid
er yourself simply a tenant at will
and obliged to move on, unless you
perform certain obligations toward
the State.
As I understand the Socialist plat
form in regard to land, they propose
to treat it just as they propose to treat
other property, namely, that that
which is socially used is to be socially
owned, and administered, and that
that which is privately used is to be
privately owned. I think that any
one who reads our platform clear
through must understand the matter
in this way. I do not see anything
in this platform which goes to show
that we will not have “the same sys
tem of land titles that we now have.”
I think myself that we will likely
have the same system, or a very sim
ilar one.
(Answer: If Mr. Raoul were to
make to a Chicago Socialist that
statement about the private owner
ship of land, he would have a scrap
on his hands in a pair of minutes.
In 1904, I was addressing a large
audience one night at Princess Rink,
Chicago. The audience demonstrated
enthusiastically and I thought I was
getting along “fine”. But when *1
took my seat a wild-eyed chap sprang
up and yelled, “That man Watson is
in favor of the private ownership of
land. Here it is in his Letter of Ac-
A Letter from an Atlanta Socialist
ceptance”. Then hades broke loose.
It was worse than if I had been ac
cused of looting a bank or stealing
a railroad. The Socialists appeared
to want to mob me. My friends
“rallied around”, the lights were
turned off, and we managed to get
away without any casualties.
The Socialist platform in this
country demands in plain terms the
public ownership of land, without
exception. I advise Mr. Raowl to
read “Woman Under Socialism”, by
Herr Bebel, the official head of the
German Socialists. He will then ad
mit that he is in error on this land
business. There can be no such thing
as private ownership of land under
Socialism.)
(3) Now, in Section 2, I think
you forget the manner in which you
proposed to discuss this matter.
You go off into a whole lot of pyro
technics about what will be the state
of affairs under Socialism, and I
don’t consider you much of a prophet
in that line. You don’t back up your
prophecies with any reasonable argu
ment. You don’t base any of your
argument on our proposals as set
forth in our platform.
The Socialists want certain defi
nite things, and plainly state their
demands in their platform. Now, as
to what would be the state of affairs
under these conditions is a matter of
speculation. You may build one
mental picture of this future and I
another, but my objection to your
opinions about this future state is
t h at they are too dogmatic. You
write as though you had been there
and seen the whole thing, and had
come back into the present to tell us
about it.
(Answer: If I was too dogmatic
or cock-sure, I beg to be forgiven.
The offense was unintentional.
In my judgment, Socialism works
a dissolution of the family, because
the State takes over the duties and
responsibilities of parents, leaves no
office for the head of the family, per
mits of no permanent, inheritable
home, and renders the legitimacy of
children a matter of no consequence
to the state, to the mother, or to the
child.
The human race has experimented
with this system over and often, and,
therefore, I was not prophesying
when speaking of its necessary con
sequences. Mr. Raoul should read
Plutarch, Finck and Bebel. Also,
the works of Mason and Crawley.)
(4) My idea about this future
state is that it will be a state of “in
dustrial democracy”, and industrial
democracy means to me the rule of
industry by those engaged in indus
try. I believe that each industry will
be largely governed by those en
gaged in that industry, and that each
factory will be largely governed by
those in that factory. As to “Boss
es” and “Boards of Direction”, the
Lord knows we have a plenty of those
now. The difference under a Social
istic state will be, I think, that the
“Bosses” and “Boards of Direction”
will be selected by those they direct,
and not by some private owner who
is spending his time in Europe or
playing golf at some distant “resort”.
Wherever men work in collective
bodies, they will always need a di
rector of the common effort, but the
difference is between “inheriting”
this director or choosing him our
selves from among those whom he is
to direct.
(Answer: But my dear Mr.
Raoul, no man, even in this age of
□effersoniatx
grossly-abused privilege, assumes to
decide for others what avocations
they shall follow. Inherent in every
human being, is the craving for in
dependence. In the large cities,
where ten men chase each job, the
employers have the advantage and,
humanly, they abuse it. In the rural
communities where ten jobs chase
one man, the laborer has the ad
vantage and, humanly, takes ad
vantage of it.
White house-keepers find the ut
most difficulty in keeping cooks,
housemaids and wash-women. And
oh! how nicely these servants have
to be treated! And oh! how we
have to wink at the steady little tin
bucket —not so very small either —
that she totes out every evening,
filled with vituals to feed the trifling
man that she “keeps”!
As to field-hands, it is practically
impossible to get and keep them.
Hence, farms have to be rented out,
and they are botched and damaged
until in a few years they don’t look
like the same places.)
(5) I don’t see any trouble ahead
for that “Aristocrat of Talent”.
Everybody will have an opportunity
to show what they are worth, in the
factory and on the farm, and I think
they will be liberally rewarded. As
for the aristocrat who wants to write
books or paint pictures, he will have
twice the chance he has now. If he
does good work, the people will buy
it, and they will have the cash to do
it with. If he fails in the effort, he
w’ill have a job open to him in indus
trial lines. I believe many people will
work both industrially and artistical
ly; for all will have the time to do
this. As Berger put it when asked,
what would become of Science, Art
and Letters, “They will become com
mon”. It seems to me it would be a
great thing if this “Aristocracy”
were not so exclusive.
Socialism strikes, not at the worker,
not at his home, not at his individu
ality or freedom, but at the idle own
er who rules now with an iron hand,
born of unlimited and unrestricted
power. The power of the private
ownership of the means of life.
nd 7 isl
(Answer: Mr. Raoul speaks of
“the aristocrat who wants to write
books”, and contends that he and the
artist will have “twice the chance he
has now”. He quotes with delight
Mr. Berger’s statement that Science,
Art and Letters “will become com
mon”.
Let us reason together: You say
that if Tom wants to write books, he
may? Yes. And if Dick wishes to
paint pictures, he may? Yes. And
if Harry desires to work in the labo
ratory, he may? Yes. That is Mr.
Raoul’s contention. Then if Tom,
Dick and Harry will be permitted to
choose their own avocations, the
same privilege must be extended to
all, —eh, Brother Raoul? It follows,
logically. Then Socialism means
that nobody need do anything that
he doesn’t want to do? Logically,
we come to that.
Then, oh, heavens! who is to clean
out the, —well sundry nasty places
that one could mention? The “nas
ty work” nut is a mighty hard one
for the Socialists to crack, and they
generally go to foaming at the mouth
when you allude to it.
I wonder whether Victor Berger
knows what he means when he
speaks of .Science, Art and Letters
“becoming common”. Under no pos
sible system could such men as Edi
son, Orville Wright, Hiram Powers,
W. W. Story, and Edgar Poe “be
come common”! Nor could the full
appreciation of genius ever “become
common”.
The only exclusiveness talent now
asks or enjoys is the exclusiveness
which enables it to do its work. To
accomplish anything, men and wom
en of genius must be much alone, —
else they cannot attain the abstrac
tion indispensable to concentrated
mental effort.)
(6) In number 3, you simply cite
what this man, or that man, or your
self, thinks will be the state of af
fairs under a Socialistic state. You
do not take our platform and show
from it why all these horrible things
about marriage will come to pass.
For my part, I believe that we would
have a great deal of freedom of love
in a certain sense, and that it would
evidence itself by a great many more
men taking unto themselves wives
and living w’ith them in a monoga
mous state.
(Answer: The Socialist papers
and books have pictured to us so
minutely how everything will look
under Socialism, that I was com
menting on the picture as they them
selves draw it.
By all means, Mr. Raoul, buy Herr
Bebel’s book and read it. American
evangels of Socialism are concealing
some vitally important parts of the
creed. Read “Woman Under So
cialism”, and see where you’re going
to, young man.)
(7) I would like to have a wife
myself, but I am not able to support
one under the present state of af
fairs, and there are thousands of men
in the same fix.
(Answer: Not able to support a
wife under the present system? An
Atlanta youth makes that confes
sion?
We must not take young Mr.
Raoul too seriously when he says
that. Wait till he falls in love with
the right girl, and you’ll see a dif
ferent Raoul. He will do as so many
thousands of us impoverished Geor
gians have done since the Civil War.
He will go after that girl, marry
her. in spite of all creation, and then
go to work manfully to support her.
Whenever the grand passion strikes
him, he will wed the lady of his
love, even if it becomes necessary
for him “to work in the field” for a
living.)
(8) As to the negro’s place under
a Socialistic state, it would be one
of absolute economic and political
equality. To my mind, this means a
practical solution of the so-called
“race problem”. Then the races
would have the privilege of living
apart, which they do not now have.
Most of us believe that there is a
natural race feeling which tends to
separate the Caucasian from the Ne
gro. But look around you and see
how capitalism is breaking down the
natural barrier. Go to the well-to-do
neighborhoods of any large Southern
city and see if you find the whites
and negroes living side by side.
Then take a look at our less favored
brothers. They do not choose these
shacks next door to the negro be
cause they like to live by him. No,
they do it because they can’t afford
