Tories Bayou.
A
The latest from this notorious out.
let informs us that the Government
dan has yielded to the water pres
sure and given away, and again tlhe
the current is pouring through this
rice natura'l!ct with its accustomed
velocity.
Fifty thousand doilars of tili cur- I
rency of the United States was not e
sufficient to arrest the current of wat- n
or following the natural inclination of
the t'lluric surface to be found at 8
that particular locality. tl
When water can be taught to find I1
its way "to thle sea" up an ilncined 5
plain and be made to abandon its self- b
made course, then, andl then only c
will any practicle good be derived P
from the hitherto futile attempts to
block up the "short eat" for the wat- ti
r ti
crs of Red River. hi
It is one of the most remarkable ii
facts of the day, in connection with I
this Tones Bayou athfir, that the men u
of science ivrii harv surveyed the li
valley of Red River were not taught ii
by the rapid current flowing through
the mouth of tle bha you that there ti
was a natural cause for this thing ti
and to oppose it was detrimental to
a large class of land owners in that "
section. If the object had in view, ci
in closing up the mouth was to pro- 1) D
cure "low ;.:er navigation," t''ey a
could have better obtained this Ic- u
suit by following this rapid current
through Tones Bayou into Bayou A
Pierre removing obstruction where it tI
became sluggish and giving it all the it
- help it required to make its own
channel.
Closing up any of the natural "out- L
let" in the valley of Red River is not
only lrejt'jiical id to the land-own- a:
ets there unto belonging, but it is i
opposed to all science and the laws w
of hydrostatics. Moreover there is 1
another light wherein to view this re
subject of the closing up of Tones cc
Bayou. Some few years passed the tip
lands known as "swamp lands'" be 11
longed to the State and the Legisla- H
ture made an approiriation of many i"
thousand dollars to clean out the ob- ot
structions in Bayou Pierre, deepeni el
its cihatmel, and thItxvby redee;m tihe
lands on its banks and contiguous at
thereto. iti
Upon the faith of this appropriation th
for the purpose of redbeining tuese t
lands they were sold and private in- el
dividuals became the purchasers. ha
The irijpopriation made by the "i
State was insufficient fof the com
sit
pletion of the Work, yet enough was Se
t accomplished to give increased im- w(
petus to the current, which alone it, tlh
a course of time would have redeenmed S
the lands and triade good the faith of
r the State. la'
Now then thie question arises, what I
right hasthe general governulfnt to CO
e come forward and interfere with the fom
e pledges of the State be
SThe purchase money for these lands pr
hbfts gone into the treasury of t tic
SState and it remains for her to see pe
I that this tacit coutract is carrrcd out ev
so far flt in her power lies; and we at
.contend that it is her duty to see
that no one steps in to interfere in stf
this matter, not even the Federal got- all
ernmbid. ev
The State has been enjoying the
yearly taxes on fihsd lands which it3
she never could have done but for oi
her promise to have them redeemed li
be
by deepening thIe channel of Bayou ca
Pierre; and now for the Genetadil Gov w
ernment to step in for the p'urp'hsc of ist
closing up ToneA Bayto, and for
ever shutting off the idter from Ba
you Pieib is an act of bad faith to
the original purclhasers or their legit
i'mate Auccessors. It is ii well es- ca
tablished principle in political econ. ed
&my that no one shall enjoy property ma
to the prejudice of another, and if
steamboat men and thie interest of se
commerce requires navigation im. no
proved in Red River, they must find i'r
it through the proper channel. If in
one-half of the money that has been kl
expended in Ctosing up Tones Bayou sec
had been used for the )purpose of re
moving obstructions in Bayou Pierre m(
and deepening tile chbannel ,tlhroough h
the lakes, there would have be;tt by at
time
this time low water navigation
through this route.

t. numibher of the hallots governed the
of verdict of the canvassers. Repeated
v, as all imnpartial observers knows,
t the l)emocrats polled a majority of

Ad ported against the wrongs colnmitted l
in echalf of their own party, and no
p olitician of promninence, even inll

ail ever defended themu. A lthiub

to That board wits pr'ecisely the same

, a witness of wrongs which he coull
not prevent, has resigned and his (

wonder thinat its decisions slIonIhi be
sII scrutinized witlh susplicion, and that (
it the country should refuse to ancclt t
Io its statemiients of fact until they hlhve I
been verified by outside testlldiony Iv
nNay, we may go further; it is very
surprising that the )cieoci'ats of

ence mighlit justify thetmi in tegarding t

s conseqienles depeniling upoii the ac- I
Se tion of the board this year have only 1,

the President was perverse and the a

while thie Senate, admitting thht thie I
