The tire engine was taken dlown

to tiring it out every evening, and

Rev. Morrill was the recipient of
a cowardly letter early this week.
It was anonymous, hence cowardly.
It the writer had any grievance to
settle why not come out hIol ly,
not take advantage of the refuge
of cowards by mailing an unsign
ed letter.
Such an action des'rvyes the con
demnation of all good citizens, andl
is sure to be discountenancel by
the people of Natchitoches.
Come again Brother to teach the
way of salvation for those who
need to be shown the road.

Editor Louisiana Populist :
Dear Sir:--Some time since a
card was published in the Enter
prise signed by me, denying my
name being to certain resolutions
published in your paper from ward
5, and declaring myself to be a law
abiding citizen, this is the sub
stnce If not the exact words ; from
which statement it went out im
mediately that I had gone over to
the Democratic party and taken
an oath to support amid party,
This is a base falsehood to begin
with.
Teen I see in the Shreveport
times a statement ip regard to
the above, at rsays that I went to
the Clhrk ad asked for my com
alutim an d was told that it had

There was a great cry for white
supremacy in the parish, which
was only to carry tie Smnatorhal
district for Trichel and Livernian.
nothing more or less; if the Dem
ocrats could have controlled the
negro votes of this parish as they
did Red River and DeSoto, there
would not have been one word said

white votes had been allowed all

The Outlook.
The political outlook is to-day
tilled with much unc,,rtainty. In
making our forecast we leave the
Republican party out, as it has
sealed its fate by adopting the
gold standar, I. The l)emocratic
party, if it acts with unprecedent
ed wisdom and non-partisan4hip,
can unite all tl;e elements of re
form.
So far the name of only one
Democrat Las been promin -ntly
mentioned for the Presidential
nomination-that of Boies, of Iowa.
We have in our possession the
financial plnmk written by Mr.
Boics for the Iowa State Conven
tion, and it is one that Cleveland,
Sherman. and Carlisle would en
dorse without dotting an i or
crossing a t.
The Democrats cannot by any
possibility win without the help of
others outside of their party, and
this help they cannot get unless the
nomination carries with it some
assurance and pledge of good faith
on their part and at the same time
proves to the world that they put
principle far above party. Is
there a Simon pure Democrat that
can be trusted in a party with a
large and extreme gold minority

mi the grandest opportunity ever

Read the address of the in \who
Ibolted at St. Louis, published in
another column.
Mr. Teller was one of the noble
band that sttxxl between the South
and the force bill in 15,). This is
not the first time he stood between
the people and acts of party ty
ranny, or Ihls taken issue with his
party on vital questions. Mr. Tel
ler has given us the only utterance
in the Fify-fourth Congress that
will live in history, when he said,
S"As I speak, so I will vote," and
he has been true to it, as his action
last week proves.
Let us take this noble and man
ly sentiment as our battle-cry, in
scribe it on our banners, and the
people will rally to it as one man,
and easily reclaim their now lost
heritage--a free government.
Will the Democratic party have
