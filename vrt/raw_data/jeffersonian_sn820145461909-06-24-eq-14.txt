You have a feeling of secur-
ity if there are telephones in the community. As a
means of protection the telephone is of inestima
ble value in rural districts. In widely separated dis
tricts neighbors can communicate quickly with B
each other and with the nearest town.
Under the plan of the Bell System any farmer
■ can secure telephone service at low cost.

ceries at his store and knew him.
“Vote for Keating,” he said at’ the
shops during a dinner hour, standing
there watching them eat.
“But why?” asked one.
Hodge turned on him slowly.
“Didn’t you know he was honest?”
said he.
“Yes; but thunder, what’s the mat
ter with the party already in? The
mayor’s one of the hoys.”
The chump’s finger went up.
“The mayor fined John Slack just
one dollar for keeping the back door
of his saloon open on Sunday, and
he did it against his will. There’s a
row of stinking hovels on Green
street, not a block from the public
square, and you call them the Levee.
Every man here knows what goes on
in that row.”
“I like these railroaders,” said he
to Keating, “I can understand peo
ple who make things with their
hands.” He paused awhile. “I’ve
learned something new. It’s this: I
have to do something else besides
run this grocery store. I have to
change things. I was looking at that
iron court-house fence. I. think I’ll
take that down.”
The handsome court-house occupied
the center of the wide, grassy square.
The expanse of its green lawm was
broken only by a single monument
to an Indiana regiment, and all round
it ran a high, brown, iron fence.
Keating stood twisting his mustache
and staring at his friend in a puzzled
way.
“Martin Hodge, what’s working in
you?”
“I’ve bought the Princeton Morn
ing Herald,” said Hodge.
“My Lord!” cried Keating.
Hodge’s face looked dully angry.
“There are too many things in this
town that ought to be changed. First,
I’m going to make the paper stand
for you, and it’s going to elect you.
Incidentally I’ll get the city to buy
my land in the South Side at cost
and make a park out of it. Then,
when you can handle the reins, you’re
going to tear down this' iron fence.
It weighs on me. I can’t stand it —
to look out every day and see that
accursed fence. Then, we’ll put seats
in the court-house yard and make a
park out of that. Afterward, we’ll
put a clock in the tower.”
Keating was shrewd enough to see
what Hodge had probably never
thought of, that these might become
the very catch-words to elect him.
He smiled in his twinkling way.
“Is that all?” asked he.
“We’d smash the Levee if we ever
grew tall enough,” said Hodge.
“Maybe we shall,” laughed Keat
ing.
The Morning Herald, with a good
editor at the desk became a sudden
power in the town. Its successive is
sues gave the public the impression
of so many blows. The railroad
people took up the cry for the park.
The chump was all at once a local
celebrity. Many wondered what ul
terior, dishonest motive such an un
suspected “country” could have in
breaking out in this manner. Sen
sitive people of an upper class pro
fessed to be offended ot this boulder
of a man who had begun to roll and
bump, smashing in the town. The
party which was antagonistic to Keat-

ing and his friends, and which had
given the town a flagrantly rotten
administration, at first hooted at,
then virulenty attacked, Hodge.
Keating was called Hodge’s puppet,
but the slim man had poise, keen
ness, and strength of his own, though
Martin was his pedestal. After an
exciting struggle the corrupter legion
was overthrown by the more honest
one, a majority of the county com
missioners was elected, and Keating
was not only clerk, but stood nearest
the lever of the machine.
Hodge was twenty-three years of
age; his hands seemed bigger than
ever and hung at his side in the
same awkward manner. His collar
was still rural. He had a broad
forehead and a broad jaw. Now of a
sudden he abandoned the hole under
the stairs where he had slept and,
simultaneously with this, Black re
tired from the store and turned it all
over to Hodge.
One bright December morning Is
abel Hayden came walking along the
south side of the square. Out of the
grocery store of Martin P. Hodge
came a boy lugging an armful of
books. he almost ran into her,
tripped, and fell sprawling. She
gazed down at the scattered volumes.
There was “The History of the Flor
entine Commonwealth,” with Martin
P. Hodge’s vivid signature across the
title page, at which the book was
open. The other books looked like
histories, too. Martin came walking
out of the store; she blushed when
he stopped so suddenly, and, nodding
and smiling a pensive smile, she
went sailing away.
Martin and the boy picked up the
books and carried them to a room
over a dry goods store. This apart
ment faced the street and contained
a bed, three chairs, a wash-stand,
and a table, all plain. And here
dwelt Martin.
Isabel walked to the edge of the
town and looked at the bare fields
and naked trees; then she walked
home and sat down by herself. She
had never read so big a thing about
the Florentine Commonwealth.
One year and seven months were
occupied in a long struggle with the
refractory county commissioners.
Two of them had repudiated their
platform and Hodge knew that they
were bribed. Keating won at last; the
city bought Hodge’s land at cost (this
proved him a chump still and excited
jeers), and there was a little park
beginning to smile in the center of
the South Side. At last down came
the court-house fence, a clock went
up, and a little public garden began
to flaunt flowers.
But now Martin’s own party be
came tainted. The sheriff grew
slack, was evidently winking at the
breaking of the law. The Levee was
flourishing. Toward the end of the
third year the thing happened which,
simple in itself, was a vital point in
The Chump’s career.
One night, at half-past eleven
o’clock, Hodge, Keating, and two
companions went through an alley be
hind the hovels called the Levee.
The four, Martin being the leader,
threw their united weight against a
certain door and broke it in with a
crash. There was then revealed the
complete paraphernalia of a gam-
