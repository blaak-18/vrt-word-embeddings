life's errors.
From the Forget Me Not, for 1844.
What if. in that sublimer state
To which oar son Is shall once attain,
Tiie things of Earth, ann Time, and Fate,
Shall pass before our ey«w again.
Q Shall we retiew our life's stow way,
Its wants and weariness beholding;
And by Heaven's pnror noon survey '
What Earth's dim twilight now
foldiug?
O, what a wondrous change wilf pass
O'er nil that here hath seemed or been !
Darkly we see; as through a glass,
, What then shall face to face he seen |
The untiliriKunsn of all we prilled,
The talfiehood of the love we sought.
The priceless truth of hearts despised,
The worth of all we valued'Hot i
Pcrchance, it shall not then be seen
That this, our earthy path of tears,
80 desolate a wast« Imth been
As to the mourner's eye appears.
When clearer light arwund us breaks,
Our eyes slinli read their coarse below,
A dreary life of long mistakes, •
Atoned by many a needless wo.
Our youth was passed in visions fair,
In lavishing tue wealth of heart ;
Our manhood had the harder care
Of watching all those dreams depart.
What was there left for sad old age,
Except in useless grief to rue
The errors ot a pilgrimage
We could not, if we would renew !
Yet in ourselves the evil lay,
Poor, weak artificers of wo !
Our Idols all were made of clay,
But 'twas our hand that framed them so.
We needed some diviner*call,
To teach our hearts alike to shun
The lovely lanlt of trusting all,' >
The bitter sin of trusting nom.
Turn we then witîi vain disgust ®
From love betrayed and faith deceived,
Nor let our hearts folget to trust,
When they are wounded, wrung,
grieved.
.Take Home this lesson—it is-snch
As turns Life's darkuess into light;
O! wo can never love too much,
If wo will only love aright!

Aye, fling it from thee, Lady ! 'tis the

Of all things beautiful, when they de

That flower, so lovely iu its fresh young

A Diamond Wedding .— Gen. R.
Benovides, the new mexican minis
ter 0 to the court of .Berline, and a
personal frieml and partisan of
President Tejada, was married to
Miss Friederika Isahella Holden of
New Yorlj city. The lady is not
wealthy, but is described as one of
the most beautiful brunettes in tbe
city. She is only eighteen years
old, and tall, graceful and queenly
iu carriage. The groom is aboflt
oforty-flve years olj, enormously
wealthy, and uoted in the City of
Mexico for his great learning. The
preparations for the wedding were
011 a grander and more magnificent
scale than anything of the kind
since the famous diamond wedding
.of Oviedo, the wealthy Cuban, twen
ty years ago. The groom's gilt of
silverware and jewelry to the bride
have been on exhibition all this
week, and are thus described:
A diamond cross, which had been
manufactured for tbe bride contains
eleven of the (inest bnlli nts ever
O seen here aggregating fifteen carats
valued at §6500. It hangs from a
necklace of the most delicate and
0 exquisite workmanship, from which
are pendant a large number—prob
ably 150—of diamonds, about a
u half carat each in weight. The
solitaire ear-rings accompanying
the cross ^cost $5000, and are as
lî*r#o as one's fore-flnger nail. An
other set, of cameos, consisting of a
brooch and earrings' is set in small
diamond sprays and large pearls.
There* are bracelets innumerable;
but the most remarkable are of
l.ifge pearls set in blue enamel with
diamond bauds. The chatelaine
watch is universally admired as
tbe neatest thing of the kind ever
produced here. - The chatelaine is
of the rare copper-colored gold,
with elaborate pierced workman
ship.? The face of tbe watch is less
• than a quarter of a dollar in size,
thé dial marked with both Arabic
and Roman numerals. A magnifi
cent flesbcolored ca meo, with a fig
ure of Spring, crowning herself with
îiowérs, lrom the back of the watch.
