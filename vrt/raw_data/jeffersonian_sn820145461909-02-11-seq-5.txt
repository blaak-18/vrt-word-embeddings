THE DAWN OF THE COTTON
CENTURY.
(Continued from Page Two.)
methods of transportation pause,
primitive and picturesque carriers
take up the burden of the world’s
cotton output and trudge with these
goods to eager customers along the
most remote frontiers. Cotton cloth
paves the way for Christianity in the
jungles of the Dark Continent; to the
savages of the Congo cotton cloth is
more precious than ivory or gold.
Under- the midnight sun artic dogs
drag sleds laden with cotton goods.
The yak goes burdened with cotton
goods into Tibet. Godowns along
Chinese streams are stored with cot
ton goods awaiting shipment, and to
the upper reaches of the Yang-tse
and Hoang-ho the native Chinese
trader on his junk carries cotton
cloths and . garments to interior
tribes. Burros laden with cotton
goods from England and Germany
pick their way across the mountains
of Mexico. The elephants of India
and the camels of the Levant and
Egypt carry cotton goods.
And the unique and almost un
believable fact is that this incredible
volume of traffic in cotton goods is
engineered by countries that do not
and cannot raise the raw supply. The
energy and ambition of Europe and
Japan are pledged to transporting
cotton goods to the remotest door,
but America, which furnishes the
unmanufactured product and makes
possible the commercial invasion of
the world, has little share in the
profit from that conquest.
There is portent of great and
revolutionary changes in the world’s
trade in cotton goods. It is incon
ceivable that other nations can go on
at the expense of America, winning
trade triumphs with a commodity
which they do not naturally possess,
which they canot obtain in sufficient
quantities outside of the United
States, and which they could not
manufacture at a profit but for the
fact that we sell the product near and,
at times, even below the cost of rais
ing it. There is no logical reason
why the United States should sell
Europe only four million dollars’
worth of finished cotton goods a
year while that part of the world
exports to us more than fifty million
dollars’ worth.
We have been unjustifiably jubilant
regarding our foreign trade. We sell
abroad enormous quantities of goods
and materials, but in respect to cot
ton it is largely the raw product, on.
which there is little profit. Alone
of all the industrial nations, the
United States is not an important
factor in the sale of cotton goods to
mankind. For instance, of the
international demand for cotton
yarns we supply less than one-third
of one per cent!
Here is the record, up to the date
of wirting, disclosing America’s un
success as an international trader in
cotton goods:

It is a grotesque and almost un
believable item in the commerce of
this age that a resourceful nation
like America, the producer of the
world’s cotton, should buy back
two dollars ’ worth of cotton goods for
every dollar’s worth it ships abroad.
When our competitors buy from us
eight or nine million bales of un
manufactured cotton, it is a mark of
their enterprise, not of ours. The
greater part of our foreign trade is
the result of suction from abroad, not
of propulsion from America. The
need of the nations is for our raw
cotton, and they send their ships to
get it. If we were aborigines and
raised cotton, we could sell it. It re
quires no salesmen or advertising to
make raw cotton popular in all in
dustrial centers frcm Manchester to
Milan, and eastward to Japan. If
we did not have a plank afloat, we
could sell raw cotton to the world.
America is not a serious competitor
for trade oversea. In all the annals
of national pride and delusion there
has been no greater folly than the
present popular belief in the United
States that we have engineered a
commercial invasion abroad. The
trading nations must have our cotton,
and while upward of 190 tariff walls
fence them off in their rivalry, they
X5l)«. Jeffersonian
all fear America and carefully put
raw cotton on the free list.
The rivalry for foreign markets,
the improvements in the facilities Jor
reaching them, and cotton’s marvel
ous contribution to merchandise have
so revolutionized the world’s trade
that the commerce of former centuries
is insignificant in comparison. The
foreign traffic of any of the leading
industrial nations today exceeds in
volume and value the total foreign
trade of all countries combined a
hundred years ago!
Gladstone estimated that the wealth
accumulated by the nations during the
first fifty years of the nineteenth
century equaled all that had been
stored up by mankind in the preced
ing 1800 years, and that their mul
tiplying fortunes between 1850 and
1870 duplicated the record of the
foregoing fifty. So that in those
seventy years the increase of the
world’s wealth exceeded by one hun
dred per cent, the piledup treasures
of all lands in all the preceding
centuries since the birth of Christ.
And the accumulations since 1870 are
literally beyond compute.
Such a world with its consuming
power is the market that confronts
America, the country that alone
possesses the commodity indispensable,
to the nations. Thus far we have
neglected our stewardship. During
the last fiscal year we sold to the Old
World only a little over four million
dollars’ worth of finished cotton
goods. Our best customer in that
part of the world was the United
Kingdom, which bought from us
$1,853,984 worth. But while we were
growing foolishly proud over that,
England was selling us $23,165,392
worth of cotton goods spun of our
own material.
Such is the inglorious story of our
traffic with our greatest European
customer. And England is adding to
its cotton-spindles at the rate of more
than two hundred thousand every thir
ty days! In the past twelve months
this increase in the United Kingdom
was 2,765,000. And every new mill and
every new spindle in England is
erected with the confidence that the
raw cotton can be obtained from the
American planter at prices which
BEGGAR HIM.
Cotton is the world’s king, but it
sits on a British throne!
Last year we exported a little over
two hundred million yards of piece
goods, valued at fifteen million
dollars, but at the same time the
United Kingdom was selling abroad
more than six billion yards, valued at
more than four hundred million
dollars!
If you confront the ordinary
jubilant statistician with the cold
analysis of our unsuccess abroad, the
rejoinder is apt to be that, after all,
America for many years has had a
41 favorable balance of trade.” In a
recent optimistic review of America’s
foreign commerce it is set forth with
much elation that the excess of ex
ports over imports in the past fiscal
year amounted in value to $446,000,-
000. But to get those figures we had
to count in $482,000,000 worth of raw
cotton shipped abroad; and if we
cross out raw cotton from the record,
our foreign commerce reveals an
export trade considerably less than
our import; and as unmanufactured
cotton is sold abroad through no
enterprise on the part of America,

but is rather a traffic resulting from
our neglect of our opportunity, there
is nothing in the mere totals of our
foreign traffic to warrant the com
placency of our statesmen.
There was a time when Yankee
packets carried American wares
around the world, but we have
abandoned our ships, and they have
all but vanished from the seas. The
federal hand has been busy building
break-waters, scooping out harbors,
and deepening inland waterways.
Now we are cutting a channel
through the hemisphere. We have
built and maintained (and should
continue to do so) a protecting coast
and continental wall completely
around our industries; so that the
domestic commerce of America today
exceeds by more than one hundred
per cent, the total exports from all
nations combined. Conscious of our
strength, and in the presence of
bewildering achievements at home, we
find it difficult to realize that our
dominion pauses at the shores of our
seas. The decline of our merchant
marine from the days of great
achievement is not the result of any
decrease in our national vigor. The
energy and genius of the American
people have simply been withdrawn
from the sea. We have expended
our ingenuity and strength and riches
in exploiting the continent, or at
least the northern and western part
of it, with the result that we have de
veloped between the two great oceans
the most successful industrial nation
the world has known.
Last year, not a single American
ship sailed oversea from Savannah,
but 196 foreign steamships carrying
raw cotton cleared from that port.
From Mobile 547 foreign steam
ships cleared, bearing more than
half a million cargo tons. It was
cotton. From that Gulf city the
federal records report the forlorn
fact that only one American steam
