Sleep
Sleep is nature’s^re
building period, when the
energy used by the brain,
muscles and organs is re
newed. If you lose sleep,
your system is robbed of
the strength sleep should
give; Continued loss of
sleep multiplies this loss
until you become a phys
ical wreck. Dr. Miles’
Nervine quiets the irri
tated nerves and brings
refreshing, invigorating
sleep. Nervine contains
no opiates, and therefor
leaves no bad after-effects.
"For over two years I suffered un
told agonies; my friends thought I
was going crazy, i could not sleep
nor rest at all. I tried different doc
tors, bur failed to find relief. My
head would ache all the time; I was
like one drunk; could not concentrate
my mind, and was so restless and
worried that sleep was out of the
question. After taking one bottle of
Dr. Miles’ Nervine I felt wonderfully
changed. lam now on my third bot
tle and am gaining all the time. I
can lie down and sleep like a child,
and am able to do my ■work.”
MRS. MAY SCOTT, English, Ind.
Your druggist sells Dr. Miles’ Nerv
ine, and we authorize him to return
price of first bottle (only) if it fails
to benefit you.

IN THE BATTLE OF ORINSKANY.

bravery while the light was being
waged hand to hand with the great
est fury.
■Suddenly the cry of“( Jonah!
Oonah!” began to sound above the
rifle shots.
“What’s that?" asked General
Herkimer.
“It is the Indian call of retreat,”
Light toot replied. “The Mohawks
will tight no more today.”
“That settles it!” the General
muttered and resumed his smoking.
His prediction proved true. As
soon as the Indians retreated the
British were no longer able to hold
their ground. The battle was at an
end.
Both sides he. had suffered great
losses. The Americans had held
their ground, but they had been
unable to reach the. fort. The garri
son, however, taking advantage of
the opportunity had attacked the
camp of the enemy and had managed
to carry off a large part of hi£
supplies into the fort.
Lightfoot lost no time in seeking
his father, and each was overjoyed
to find the other unhurt. But it
was a sad march homeward. General
Herkimer was carried in a litter, and
although he saw the fight won lie did
not long survive, dying of his wound
a short time afterward A monu
ment to his bravery stands today on
the spot where he and Lightfoot sat
beneath the great pine and watched
the battle. —New York Herald.
V e are moved to remark that there
should not be so much alarm over the
“feminization” of boy pupils, in
view of the fact that the majority of
great men ascribed their success to
their mothers or their wives.—The

IT PAYS.
When the dimpled baby’a hungry,
what does the baby do?
It doesn’t lie serenely and merely
sweetly coo;
The hungry baby bellows with all its
little might
And someone gives it something to
curb its appetite.
The infant with the bottle which stills
its fretful cries
A lesson plainly teaches —it pays to
advertise.
The lamb lost on the hillside when
darkness closes round
'Stands not in silence trembling and
waiting to be found;
Its plaintive bleating echoes across
the vales and meads
Until the shepherd hears it, and, hear
ing, kindly heeds;
And .when its fears are ended, as on
the breast it lies
The lamb has made this patent —It
pays to advertise.
The fair and gen r ’e maiden Mho loves
the bashful boy
Assumes when in his presence a man
ner that is coy;
She blushes and she trembles nil he
perceives at last.
And clasps her closely to him and
gladly holds her fast:
And as he bends to kiss hoi and she
serenely sighs,
The fact is demonstrated —It pays to
advertise.
