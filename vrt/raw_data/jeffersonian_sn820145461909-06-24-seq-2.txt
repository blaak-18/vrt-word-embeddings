PAGE TWO
THE CHUMP
By Chas. Fleming Ambree
Throughout his school-days
they called him a chump,
and later on, though they
did not use the word, they
still thought of him as one. Martin
P. Hodge, in coarse gray and odd
square shoes, entered the high school
conscious of occupying that place in
the eyes of his fellows. He accepted
the appellation. There are worse
things than chumps, said he.
Even at twelve years of age, when
he first wore white collars much too
large and of that appearance called
“country,’’when his hands were be
ginning to grow heavy, his eyes calm,
and his jaw was becoming massive,
even then he loved Isabel Hayden,
who had begun, so young, to take
Latin ahead of her class and to enter
into the high school room a half-hour
each day to recite it. But, Isabel’s
father being a judge, she was the
furthest removed from a chump; a
slender thing, intellectual and sweet,
who at eleven years of age had sung
once, daintily, as Martin went by:
"Chumpy—chumpy—chumpy.”
But immediately she became too
old, too bright, and too good to call
out such things.
His parents died when lie was in
the second year of the high school,
and, being left penniless, he took up
his books, walked to the high school
door (still being very “country” in
appearance), turned, gazed long on
Isabel, and went away.
A certain grocery keeper on the
south side of the square, one Black,
would now employ Martin. The
youth went into that store and ob
served to Black:
“I’m here.”
Black showed him a hole under the
stairs, away at the back of the store,
where there was a straw mattress.
Here slept Martin P. Hodge for seven
years, during which time his salary,
originally ten dollars a month, in
creased.
There was no such thing as “com
ing out” in Princeton. Girls seldom
made a formal debut; everything
flowed on with more simplicity. Isa
bel gave parties, and went to them,
a tall, slender, intellectual girl, sweet
and serious; but Martin P. Hodge
was of the under-sea, and nobody
ever invited him. This did not grieve
him; he looked on and pondered. He
drove the grocery wagon; at times
tramped, with heavy shoes and red
hands of power, into Judge Hayden’s
kitchen to pour potatoes into a box
that stood there. Once, finding her in
a long apron, hair up in a high twist
with a rose in it, making candy, he
seemed to gaze at her as some un
fathomable philosopher gazes on hu
manity.
“Good morning, Martin,” she said,
friendly and kind. “Have a piece of
the taffy?”
He refused with the deference of a
caged lion who favors you with an
infinite dignity. What was there in
his clothes that was so chumpy?
When he had departed she looked at
the kitchen, at the potatoes, and had
the feeling that something tremen
dous had gone.
Judge Hayden read Homer, trod
sedately on the streets, his unbearded
face the acme of the aristocratic, and
believed in encouraging honest
young fellows. Out of his high re
serve he spoke to Martin P. Hodge,
stilted but inspiriting, and made
grave observations about the open
ings which the United States offers
to young men. Hodge, the oyster
spoon in hand, gazed with stolidity
on Hayden. The judge instilled his
kindly philosophy into his family,
and long after he himself had lost
Hodge in the lower mists, Isabel
made it a point, no matter how
beautifully gowned, to speak to Mar
tin as she passed the store. Martin,
original observer of phenomena, un
consciously determined to take noth
ing for granted in this world and find
out everything for himself, knew just
how matters stood. He cared not at
all; he had no rebelliousness, no
jealousy, no wants.
“One crowd goes to parties and
dresses better,” said he. The other
can give parties of their own, but
they can’t go to the first crowd’s
parties. That’s all there is to it.”
At twenty years of age Hodge had
learned one thing: that power will
conquer.
“Mr. Black,” said he, “I have pur
chased thirteen lots in the South
Side with my savings.”
“And what if the price falls?”
cried Black, plainly calling Hodge a
lunatic.
“Why,” said Hodge, turning that
gray eye and that calm face, which
meant no more than a bowlder on a
hill-side means, toward Black, “what
difference will it make?”
Robert Keating, deputy county
clerk, was in the store, a slim man
with a keen eye. He broke out:
“You fool! You’d lose your
money.”
Hodge laid his cuffs on the counter
and regarded Keating. “What differ
ence would that make?” he asked.
There it was—all of it. You can’t
get around that kind of a chump.
Keating, magnetized, later bought
some lots in the South Side. The
railroad shops came; the price went
up; Martin P. Hodge bought an in
terest in the grocery store. There
was nothing “country” about that
shop; your little cities of the Middle
West are grown spruce, shining up
to-date; but Martin Hodge, common,
heavy creature, seemed to have
changed but little.
Up this long ascent had he climbed
not even puffing. The world was just
the same; to be above or below it or
wedging up through it, that didn’t
change the world a whit.
Keating, who was about to become
county clerk himself, and had pros
pered somewhat along with Hodge,
was fascinated by Martin. He looked
to Martin for advice. He was an
emotional fellow who loved a good
friend, and Hodge controlled him,
without ever trying to.
One winter night they sat by the
stove in the rear of the long store.
It was after working hours.
“Rob,” said Martin, after a season
of meditation; “I am going to Judge
Hayden’s now.”
Keating was pleasingly dressed,
devoid of all the “countriness” that
©fye
marked the man before him. He
turned a surprised eye on Hodge.
“What for?” asked he.
“To ask Isabel to marry me,” said
Hodge.
Keating was on his feet.
“My Lord! You unfathomable
chump!”
“Os course,” said Hodge. “Sit
down.” A strange wideness marked
his eye. He said no more for a quar
ter of an hour; then he leaned slowly
forward, with a finger in the air.
“Robert Keating, I am a chump,”
said he, speaking with decision. “Let
that stand. The reason I speak of
her calmly is because my feeling for
her is the force that moves every
thing in me. I never learned any
thing by hearsay in my life. I’m not
going to take the world’s idea of this
for granted now. Because every one
would say the gulf can not be bridg
ed, I am going to find out whether it
can or not. I am too plain for or
namentation. My feeling is too pro
found for ornamentation. You are
a friend of mine and I give you
my explanation. What is more, I
will put on no exterior badges
of a social position to which my
nature is foreign. I will not
learn to dress differently. I will
not work slowly into this upper
class and learn to conduct myself
aright at her parties. I will not join
her church. I will not pretend, or
strive after, an education such as is
hers and her father’s, and in com
parison to which whatever I might
plaster on would be but a rag. Rob
ert Keating, you and I are raised on
a mental milk made out of these
sentences: All men are created
equal. There is no class in America.
Riches and poverty make no differ
ence. The clothes are not the man.
None shall be deprived of rights be
cause of religious belief. Honesty
and cleanliness make all men broth
ers. Power, standing alone, will
conquer.” He paused, then resumed.
“I am going to see if all those things
are words.”
To no other man had he ever spok
en his thoughts; Keating had never
seen into him so far before.
A half-hour later Martin P. Hodge
was admitted into Judge Hayden’s
parlor and Isabel had shaken hands
with him pleasantly. That was his
first visit there. He had never be
fore, anywhere, looked so completely
and hopelessly a chump. Isabel, now
twenty-one years of age, was tall and
wore glasses. She had a face that
spoke first of all, and above all, in
telligence. Her hair was auburn
and waved a little round a white
forehead. Her nose was straight,
her lips were very sensitive, her chin
was of an honest Grecian outline.
She had laid down a volume of Mon
taigne’s essays to receive him. Her
dress, dark green, floated away beau
tifully at the side of her chair.
Here was a predicament for her;
she said ten detached brave things,
placidly, each one showing a sweet
nature. Nothing could make that
conversation go. What was the
cause of the suggestion of strength
which she got from his awkward at
titude? As for him, he was thinking
how she looked when, wasp-like,
slim-legged, she had called “Chumpy
—chumpy—chumpy,” so long ago—
and that he loved her. Now she
paused in her attempts, pained by
failure, and he said:
“Isabel, what I shall say will sur
prise you. That I cannot help, for a
man must do his best and let the
rest go. Between you and me there
is an apparently unfathomable gulf.
I never came here before. I can’t
even say that I ever wanted to. Now
that I have come, believe first that
I am honest.” His eyes had that
strange wideness and were somehow
sad. She seemed a little frightened,
but could not look away. “You and
I were brought up in a sense togeth
er. The weeding out begins at about
the age of fourteen, but we carry
with us, in spite of that, all the old
axioms about people being equal, and
we believe them. Isabel, I am blind
when it comes to roundabout meth
ods. But I have learned a truth or
two, not out of books. And on a
rock-bottom truth I can walk as
straight as any man. Well,” he fold
ed his hands and turned his square
face fully on her, “the truth is this,
that I loved you when we went to
school together, that I loved you
when you called me a chump, and
that I love you today. I don’t ask
you to marry me. I ask you to think
about it as long as you like in order
to see if you can.”
There was a dumb patience in his
face. She had been too astonished,
also too incongruously moved, to stop
him. She had felt the flush go over
her forehead. Now she regained her
composure and sat with her lips
pressed together, thinking of her an
swer. There was in her eyes the
softness of the gentle.
“Os course, it has surprised me,”
she said, a little agitated, for she
was not the girl to undervalue any
kind of a man. “And it is pain,
more than surprise. It is impossible
—impossible. Oh, Mr. Hodge, for
give me!”
He arose, seeming ponderous and
gray.
“Good-by,” said he. “Thank
you.”
He held out his heavy hand, and
she, now on her feet, took it. He
turned to the door. She was strange
ly stirred with regret, as though she
had committed a great sin and must
atone.
“I wish—l wish,” she faltered,
“that you could still believe me your
friend.”
He paused at the hall door with
his hat in his hand and looked at her
once more.
“I do,” he said; and she staring at
his face, seemed to read in it some
all-comprehensive power. He went
away.
On the public square, which was
now deserted, he stood in front of
the store. The great stone had roll
ed down. As the ant refashions the
crushed abode, so Martin P. Hodge,
chump, turned back to roll it up
again.
11.
There followed some colorless
weeks of speechless thought-search.
Then he told himself that he had to
be doing something. The county
elections were fiercely fought, and
because he was attached to Keating
here was a natural field for activities.
He still retained a little tract of land
in the South Side, which section of
the town was now built up with the
cottages of railroaders, and the shops
smoked and hammered four blocks
distant. His property brought Martin
P. Hodge to that region frequently,
and he came oftener in company with
Keating. An'd presently all the rail
road people were buying their gro
