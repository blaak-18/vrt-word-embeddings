The Gazette announced last week
that Mrs. Jno. O. Mouton had gone
to New Orleans to ptutchase her
spring and summer goods. As a
" result of Mrs. Mouton's visit to
the city her millinery store is
thoroughly stocked with everything
kept by the progressive milliner.
As usual Mrs. Mouton- has dis
played much taste and spared
neither time nor motey.' in buying
her stock which she offers to the
ladies of Lafayette at prices to suit
the times. Those in need of sea
sonable head-gear will find there a
beautiful collection hats and
pretty flowers in endless varieties.
Mrs. Mouton has paid particular
attention this year to laces and
ribbons. Her line of, ladies' shoes
is perhaps the fmost complete that
she has kept in years. Elegant
slippers, low-quarters, and last but
not least, an excellent shoe called

Jury Commissioners.
The jury commissioners, Messrs.
J. C. Buchanan, Leo Doucet, Dr.
M. L. Lyons, V. E. Dupuis, Ed
ward Pellerin and W. B. Bailey,
met last Monday and drew the
venure for the April term of court.
Up to the present time the criminal
docket is very light and the cases
are of a minor nature. Unless other
grave offenses are brought to light
before the sitting of the court, the
only serious case that will receive
its attentiot will be that of Martin
iBagley, charged with murder in
Vermilion parish. This case was
transferred to this parish on a
motion for a change of venue made
by the defendant. Bagley was
tried in Abbeville, the case resulting
in a mistrial. It is said the jury
stood eleven for conviction and one
for acquittal, and the latter was
subsequently charged with perjury.
A number of prominent lawyers are
employed in the case and should
there be no obstacles in the way of
a trial the walls of our old court
house will resound with the forensic
eloquence of the attorneys.
For Cattle Stealing.
Sheriff Broussard and Deputy T.
Mouton brought Joseph Domingue
to town and placed him in jail on, a
charge of cattle stealing.
A Bad Accident.
News reached here Thursday
evening that Joseph Vallier" had
been killed by accident in the ma
chine shop of the Southern Pacific
at Algiers. It appears that young
Vallier and other employes were
repairing an engine, which cap
sized falling upon the unfortunate
young man killing him ihstantly
and causing serious injuries to two
men named Peterson and Huberner.
The sud!den death of young Val
lier was learned with deep sorrow
by manny people in this town who
held him in high esteem. He was
the son of the late Joe Vallier, so
well and favorably known in Lafa
yette.

ger who was killed by a train at
Duson on Jan. 23, had his life in

of Rayne has received inquiries for
information as to the young man's
death.
The Edlet Suspesided.
At the instance of a delegation of
prominent Catholics from Massa
chusetts Mgr\ Satolli, the papal
delegate, has issued a decree tem
porarily suspending the edict of
Pope 4.eo, relating to Catholic
amctihership in the Knights of Py
titias. The d-,leatihi<.isited \Wash
ington Sunday whither they had
been sent by Lafayette Lodge, of
'Pall River, Mass., to ask a hearing
on the matter. They representted
that one lodge of Pythlans in that
city consisted of 25o French Cana
dians and'one lodge in Providence
included t6o. They said So far as
they were able to observe, they
could see no conflict between Py
thianism and Catholic doctrines,
and were solicitous for a suspension
of the edict so. they might perform
their Easter duty.
His Grace seemed much surprised
at the facts presented, and was
evidently much impressed with the
manner of the men. He announced
that he would suspend the edict
temporarily and would issue a
formal decree to that effect in a few
days. He promised to bring the
matter to the attentioh of the Vati
can at the earliest moment, but
would hold out no hope that his ac
tion would be endorsed as the per
manent policy to be followed.

yette where he has a host of friends
who congratulate him upon his good
fortune in having won for his wife
so charming a young lady as Miss
Vallier.

The late pruning, burning and
destroying of the cherokee bush,
may have led soiiie of our friends
to believe that "Cherokee," the cor
respondent, had also fallen under
the keen edge of some instrument.
Not at all, reader, t'was only a
siege of "La-grippe." We are still
on the staff, slightly disabled but
again alive.
By the way, 'tis whispered around
that the Royville corporation has
sprung a leak, and that the little in
land ship is rapidly striking bottom.
We know not .if such a state of af
fairs really exists, but of one thing
we do feel sure, is that neither the
sidewalks, streets, ditches nor
bridges have been worked for many
months. It is to be hoped that
Royville will not follow the foot
steps of her sister town Broussard
ville. Will she?
The pardon of that criminal and
murderer, Ex-Judge Thos. J. Ford,
of New Orleans, is one more stain
on the honor and dignity of the
Pelican state. It was a surprise to
all law-abiding citizens, that Gov.
Foster affixed his signature to such
a document. A mhan neec not fear
to commit crime now-a-days, as the
present "pardoning machine"
backed by. other "'High" State
officials, will whitewash all errors
and again manufacture full-fledged
American citizens. Shame!

TRUE DOCTRINE.
At a Meeting ot the Mills Club
held at Albany, N. Y., last Friday
to commemorate the birthday of
Andrew Jackson, Senator Hill de
livered an admirable address.
Among other things he said:
The need of the hour, Mr. Hill
said, is the revival of the spirit of
Jacksonian Democracy among the
people. It is a time for bold,
resolute, and agressive insistence
upon the true and elementary prin
ciples of government violated on
every haid by our opponents, es
pecially in this State. It is no time
for timidity, for an apologetic atti
tude, for a tame surrender or ac
quiescence. Geitlemen of the
Mills Club-friends df revenue re
form-Democrats all, let us not be
discouraged by the political outlook.
The Democratic party has . passed
through daraer days that- these and
emerged from them stronger and
more vigorous than ever before.
Let us emulate the pluck, the forti
tude, the courage, the true Democ
racy of that distinguished chieftain
in whose memory we have assem
bled to-night. The president may
have nacldu miitakeu, but it is not
the party. There have been too
many factions dispiuting the suprem
acy, but they are not the party.
The Demkocratic party consists of a
majority of American people who
believe in Democratic principles of
government who care little for
offices and patronage, but desire
honest administration and good
government everywhere; who favor
State rights; who believe in legisla
tion to subserve the greatest good
fon the greatest number and not to
ad'ance the interests of a few, at
the etpetise of the mianty; who do
not believe in governmental partner
ship with private interests, but be
lieve in public taxation for public
purposes only And are opposed to
the raising of any more revenues or
the imposition of any more taxes
than are absolutely needed for the
legitimate purposes of the nation,
who favor equal taxation, who de
sire the greatest liberty for the in
dividual citizen consistent with the
public welfare; who are opposed to
all unjust sumptuary laws, Which
needlessly interfere with the habits
and customs of the people;
who are opposed to Federal
election laws and force bills,,
to plutocratic and to class distinc
tions and to a paternal government;
who are in favor of money of intrin
sic value, the money of our fathers,
the coined money of the constitu
tion; who desire to have legislatioh,
national and State, framed upon
consistent principles acceptable to
all political parties alike; who are
opposed to summary removals of
officials (except for just cause) be
fore the expifation of their terms,
fixed by law; who are opposed to
temporary expedients, by legisla
tion or otherwise, designed only to
secure political advantage at the ex=
pense of fairness, decency and con
sistency. There are the people
the plain people of the country
who constitute the Democracy, and
this is an epitome of its cardinal
doctrines. Such principles and
such a party will survive merely
temporary disasters accasioned
largely by a recurring period of
hard times for which no party was
really responsible.
Let us firmly adhere to these es
sential principles, let us insist upon
honest, competent And ttistwotthy
party leadership, let us harmonize
conflcting interests, discontinue
further factional disturbances, con
tinue the campaign of education,
encourage the efforts of a faithful
Democratice press, support regular
nominations whenever fairly made
and organize for future victories
which will surely await us if we are
but true to ourselves.

Then and Now.
Thete was a time when he who would
keep informed of the progress of knowledge,
the record of discovery and invention, and
the currents of human thought, could and
indeed must rely chiefly if not wholly upon
books. That day has passed. Books we
must still read, as the crystallization and
permanent embodiment of human thought
and knowiedge. But to-day it is the news
paper, the magazine, the periodical review,
upon which we must chiefly depend if we
would follow closely the intellectual move
ment of the day. And now a new difficulty
has arisen. This newspaper and periodical
literature has become so multitudinous and
bulky as to be a heavy burden to the busy
man or woman, while even the person who
has leisure Aild inclination to read widely
is often unable to get access to the current
publications. Especially in the smaller
cities, villages, and rural districts is the
lack of such opportunity felt. It is felt by
the clergyman, the teacher, the lawyer, the
physician, the merchant, the artisan, the
farmer and the cultured and thoughtful
practical literary question is: With all
these and many other classes of persons the
great practical literary question is: How
can I best supplement my indispensible
home paper? It was to answer this ques
and meet this demand that PUBLIC OPIN
ION (flow published in New York City)
was founded nine years ago. It selects the
best, condenses it to the last degree, and
serves it in convenient and attractive form.
