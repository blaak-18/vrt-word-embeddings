“THE PLEA OF THE CHILD
LABORER.’’
Under this heading there appears
an article in the North American Re
view for June, written by Mr. A. H.
Ulm, which is of the greatest inter
est to students of sociology and es
pecially to those who are combating
the evil of child labor, and which is
of particular interest to the people
of Augusta because the writer is an
Augusta man, and his experience
with the subject he treats and the
conditions he describes are largely
drawn from Augusta. Mr. Ulm is
now the secretary-elect of Governor
elect Brown. In introducing his sub
ject he states that “In my fourteenth
year circumstances placed me in a
cotton mill (in Augusta). During
the greater part of three years I was
a regular operative working in the
different departments, and mostly
where children are mainly employ
ed.’’ Then, after serving one term
of enlistment in the army, in active
duty in the Philippines, he returned
to Augusta, where he engaged in
newspaper work, and in his reporto
rial duty had occasion to become ac
quainted with the lives of cotton mill
operatives from another standpoint.
This is stated byway of preface
to show his qualification to discuss
the subject he undertakes to handle.
Different from all others who have
publicly discussed the question of
child labor in the cotton mills, who
are all professional investigators or
agitators and without practical ex
perience to guide them, the views
presented by Mr. Ulm are for that
reason of greater value.
He enters the discussion with the
unequivocal assertion that “it would
have been better if the South had
never come into possession of a sin
gle cotton factory than to have found
ed a prosperous industry on the la
bor of children.” It was child labor,
because it was cheap, that attracted
Northern investors to the Southern
textile field, and which is acting a? a
blight to a large part of its popula
tion. At least fifty per cent, of the
work in the mill can be done by chil
dren under fifteen years of age, and
“the reason that they do not do more
is that the supply of children is less
than the demands.”
In a masterly manner Mr. Ulm
portrays these little workers, who in
mid-winter “see the crack of day as
they trudge along the route to the
mill, or look from the windows of the
room in which they work,” the con
ditions in the mill and its effect upon
the young workers. He lays bare the
social conditions which are caused by
such a life, and how and why it pro
duces “hobo operatives,” “dinner
toting” husbands and fathers, and

Jeffersonian Clubs
The readers of the Jeffersonian
are a great body of reformers, filled
with potential energy, but incapable
of performance, because unorgan
ized.
To call a national convention,
choose a national committee, and
start the work from a national cen
ter, is to begin at the top to rear the
pinnacle before the foundation.
I
Nature always begins at the bot
tom. Infinitesimal atom by atom,
microscopic cell by cell, she builds,
without haste and without rest. We
must do the same.
We will begin at Thomson, Ga., be
cause that is nearest to our hands.
As soon as possible we will organize
here a Jeffersonian Club, which shall
be known as Club Number One. It
will have the usual officers and as
many members as will pay a dollar a
year and pledge themselves to take
up and carry on the active work of
Reform.
Wherever possible, get a local
newspaper interested in the w r ork.
If the local papers refuse to aid the
reformers, start a reform paper of
your own, and let it stand for what
ever is just and true, without refer
ence to party, creed or caste.
Each member will be entitled to a
year’s subscription to the Jefferso
nian, which will publish the news
and work of the clubs, and will be
their official organ.
As soon as there are as many as
twenty-five clubs in any State, the
members shall choose two of their
number in each club to form a State
Committee, who shall frame a plat
form of State issues, to be voted up
on, before adoption, by all the clubs
of the State.
Whenever State Committees have
been formed in as many as ten States,
they shall choose five of their number
from each State to form a National
Committee, who shall frame a plat
form of National issues, to be voted
"YOUR SUBSCRIPTION EXPIRES THIS MONTH"
Hereafter all subscribers to Watson’s Magazine or The Jeffersonian
will be notified of the expiration of their subscriptions by stamping
across the front page or cover of the last issues of the current month—
“YOUR SUBSCRIPTION EXPIRES THIS MONTH". If renewals are
not received in two weeks after such notice, the paper will be discon
tinued.
Watch your label and send renewal at once to THE JEFFERSON
IANS, Thomson, Ga.

upon, before adoption, by all the
clubs of each State.
The only conditions of member
ship are:
1. White parentage.
2. Payment of one dollar a year.
3. Pledge to work actively for re
forms of all kinds, —domestic, social,
civic, State and National.
Ladies are earnestly requested to
join these clubs, and to become ac
tive members. The influence of good
women in reform movements can not
be over-estimated. This will natural
ly give the clubs a social life, which
can be made a power for good in
many communities.
Junior branches of the clubs may
be formed. Just as all boys and
girls are taught something of reli
gion, so they should be taught some
thing of that social life which we
call political.
One chief object of these clubs
will be education. As soon as a club
is organized and has a home of its
own, it should arrange to have a
reading-room and library, try to get
up lectures and entertainments; and
make its influence felt, not only po
litically, but socially, by raising the
standard of thought, conversation
and living.
Each member shall wear a button
or badge, the general design and
color of which shall be the same for
all, as an outward and visible sign of
the reform spirit.
Clubs will not be allowed to be
come dormant. Each club shall, at
certain intervals, make a report of
its work, which will be published in
the Jeffersonian. A Roll of Honor
will be printed.
In order that there may be no con
fusion in the organization of these
clubs, each person who wishes to get
up a Jeffersonian Club in his or her
locality is requested to write to The
Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga., for ad
vice and instruction.
marriages where “separations and
desertions often begin before they
are together more than a few
months.”
Without a doubt this article is the
most powerful—because written by
one who best understood it—yet
written on this subject. It carries
conviction to >the reader, and will
have its effect in helping to improve
the sad condition it describes, a
work in which many philanthropists
are engaged, and in which, as Mr.
Ulm states, much progress has been
made in recent years. Bearing in
mind that it is child labor which is
responsible for the unsatisfactory so
cial conditions portrayed, Mr. Ulm
recommends, as the first necessary
steps to correct these evils:
Forbid the employment of chil
dren under fourteen years of age,
without exception; forbid the em
ployment of children under fifteen
years, except during the vacation pe
riod; forbid the permanent employ
ment of children under sixteen who
can not show a certificate of comple
tion from a standard grammar
school.
In addition to the child regula
tions, he suggests the following:
Separate the sexes as far as prac
ticable. (This can be almost com
pletely done.)
Require the employment of women
foremen or “second hands” for their
own sex.
Make it a crime to employ a mar
ried woman who is a prospective or
young mother.
Forbid the employment of women
or children for night work.
Compel the companies to furnish
comfortable chairs or stools for the
use of the girls and women during
leisure moments, and adequate, pri
vate and comfortably equipped dress
ing rooms.
Provide factory inspectors, some
of whom shall be women, to devote
their entire time to seeing that the
laws governing child and female la
bor are enforced. —The Augusta
Herald.

The capital stock of the Standard
Oil Company is $100,000,000. Their
dividends in the last ten years is
$364,004,000, or an average of $36,-
400,400 a year! So their dividends
amount to nearly 40 per cent, of their
investment per year. How does that
look to you farmers? —Custer Coun
