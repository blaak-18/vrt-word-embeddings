(Special Telegram to The Minnesota Fiery Cross)
INDIANAPOLIS, IND., Feb. 13. —In one of the most masterly
addresses given by any public man in recent years, Dr. Hiram Wes
ley Evans, Imperial Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
tonight at Cadle Tabernacle outlined in no uncertain terms, the
policy of the organization he heads, on the all-important ques
tion of public education.
The Klan, according to Dr. Evans, is in full accord with the
provisions of the Smith-Towner education bill, making f place in
the president’s cabinet for a secretary of education.
The influence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in American life
today, especially in relation to education, was brought out in the
address. It is the hope of the church to hold sway in things tem
poral as well as spiritual, the chief Klansman declared, and brought
forth conclusive proof of his assertion.
The meeting was one of the most important that has been held
in American Klandom, and the great hall was crowded to capacity.
The full text of the address, which is worth the study of every
Protestant-American as well as Klansman, who seeks the future
welfare of the nation and the generations yet to come, is as printed
below:
The Public School
Problem in America
Out of his boyhood has come to us
the sublimely simple supplication of
Abraham Lincoln:
“God help father, help mother,
help sister, help everybody.
Teach me to read and write.
Watch over Honey and make him
a good dog. And keep us all
from gettin’ lost in the wilder-
ness. Amen.”
While Lincoln was on his childish
knees, phrasing the prophetic prayer
that we be kept from getting lost in
the wilderness, there lived a man
made in God’s Image who preached
and practiced the solution of that
problem. Horace Mann, the immortal
sponsor and patron saint of education
in America, believed that—
**The national safety, prosperity
and happiness coaid be Obtained only
through free public schools, open to
all, good enough for all and attended
by all.”
I have come to Bpeak to you in
support of that fundamental Ameri
can doctrine, to proclaim its impor
tance to every phase of our private
and public life, to urge its complete
and immediate adoption as the most
essential of all national policies.
In his infancy Lincoln had expe
rience with a wilderness in which
boys and girls, even men and women,
could lose their way—an uncharted,
unpeopled expanse of woods and wa
ter in which lurked the deadliest
dangers. He lived to see those perils
disappear. Others, vastly more vi
tal, began to loom large and menac
ing. His utterances contain many
warnings with respect to a new kind
of wilderness in which, not citizens,
but society, might go astray.
There is no longer a frontier Amer
ica, but we have a wilderness in which
predominates as much of stealth and
more of vindictiveness than any jun
gle ever knew. It does not endan
ger individuals as much as it men
aces society. Out of it crouching
creatures no longer spring upon hu
mans to satisfy the pangs of hunger;
instead we have creations that prey
upon humanity to appease appetites
and passions for power. The art and
dignity of enactment is being super
seded by the unscrupulous science of
legal evasion and subterfuge. A spir
it of lawlessness is abroad in the
land, and fast ripening into an an
archy that is none the less real be
cause garbed in the ermine of re
spectability and unconnected with
red banners and black bombs. Our
ideals and traditions are being
weakened by disrespect and inatten
tion. Our politicians seek not the
common welfare, but their own suc
cess. Our schools are in every way
inadequate; they have not the insti
tutional standing to which they are
entitled; they do not prevent illiter
acy, not always promote patriotism;
too often they teach a divided alle
giance. Many of our churchy . are
becoming bickering centeff, ;ahd*
sources of ceaseless,
ing controversy, fighting t pqt Jim
forces of evil, but achr otrjer,* dhCrth',
against church, crqed «gatnpt.£f<ed %
Out of it all, and because of it all,
there has almost ceased to exist that
priceless boon to humankind known
as news; propaganda, the modern
curse of civilization that spawns
prejudice and nurtures injustice, has
taken its place. Our modern wilder
ness is full of darkness. Truth, God’s
truth and man’s truth, has become a
vagrant—ragged, distorted and dis
credited by selfishness as never be
fore in human history.
In all things, public and private,
truth must prevail. Individually, that
means intelligence, health and vir
tue. Nationally, it means liberty and
justice, the safeguarding of our tra
ditions, the fulfillment of our ideals.
To civilisation, it means security
and continued progress onward and
upward. To attain truth, we must
adopt, without reservation or eva
sion, not years hence, but now, the
kind, quality and quantity of educa
tion advocated bv Horace Mann.
Had that been done a half century
ago, we would not now be in a wil
derness of chaotic conflicts and con
fusing controversies. There would
have developed less of illness and
none of illiteracy. The religious
wrangling that again threatens our
security and the peace of the world
would not exist. Instead of an al
ready menacing growth of divided al
legiance, there would be national
solidarity. The separation of church
and state would be accomplished
Our patriotism would be operative,
rather than so generally inept and
purposeless. Had education been
foundationally established; had it
been extended, and kept free of every
perversion; had there been “free pub
lic schools, open to all, good enough
for all, and attended by all,” perfor
ming their function of teaching
“truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth,” excluding each and
every element having a selfish inter
est either in ignorance or any distor
tion of truth, we would not today be
in a life and death battle with prop
aganda.
I submit to you that all through
the ages, whenever and wherever
God’s purposes have been manifest in
the affairs of men, resulting in what
we call an advance of civilization,
that achievement has had as its ve
hicle a temporary wholesome nation
al life. Through some national en
tity has come every bit of ground
gained by and for civilization. The
elements contributing to every ad
vancement have always been law and
order, enlightenment, unity, free
dom and Justice. Interpreted in
terms of today, the antithesis of
these fundamentals may be stated as
lawlessness. Illiteracy, Inheritable
tendencies toward mental and physi
cal degeneracy, disrupting strife and
controversy, propaganda Instead of
truth, and the economic Inequities
that Increasingly threaten the very
stability of society.
I now advocate the adequate edu
cation of our future citizenship
through a free public school system,
as I have pleaaed for a rigidly en
forced immigration, adapted to our
ideals and neeeds. The two remedies
go together. Neither alone can re-
Americanize and safeguard our sa
cred institutions. If this country
continues to be flooded by inferior
peoples whose assimilation is impos
sible, the task of enlightened ad
vancement will be hopeless. Our in
differences of the last three decades
in this connection has already made
it extremely difficult; but if we now
place an embargo upon every alien
element not in harmony with our re
quirements, it is not yet too late for
the redemption of, the republic by
means of the public school for chil
dren and its auxiliaries for adults.

the further overburdening of our
composite people through unmerge

with some assurance of success, give
constructive attention to the emanci
pation of America from ignorance
and prejudice. We can free our be
loved country from every darkness
and danger.
Our Children the Chief Asset of the

You cannot dissociate citizenship
from civilization. We have a govern

Educational Policy
Outlined By Wizard
PR. HIRAM W. EVANS
In an address at Cadle Tabernacle,
Indianapolis, Wednesday, Hr. Hiram
Wesley Evans, Imperial Wizard of
the knights of the Ku klux Klan
outlined the national educational po
licy of the order. The meeting ad
dressed by Dr. Evans was one of the
largest and most enthusiastic ever
held In Indianapolis which Is prob
ably the largest klan city in the
United States.
public responsibility paramount to all
other constructive duties of the state.
We are a republic. “The consent
of the governed” is the underlying
principle of our public life. That be
ing basic, the only sure highway to
national success is adequate demo
cratic education.
Every statesman worthy of the
name has recognized that its children
were the greatest asset of any state,
and has based his hope for a glorious
national future upon their highest de
velopment as individuals and as citi
zens. Out of each decade from the
Declaration of Independence to Tea
pot Dome. I could summon the most
notable witnesses to attest the truth
of that doctrine and the necessity for
its completest attainment.
In Washington’s farewell address
we find this counsel, never surpassed
by the utterance of any statesman,
past or present:
“Promote, then, as an object of
primary importance, institutions
for the general diffusion of
knowledge. In proportion as the
structure of government gives
force to public opinion, it is es
sential that public opinion should
be enlightened.”
Let me recall another voice from
the days of our infancy. The famous
“Ordinance of 1787” contains this
historic declaration:
“Religion, morality and knowl
edge, being necessary to good gov
ernment and the happiness of
mankind, schools and tne means
of education shall forever be en
couraged.”
That was our earliest educational
statute on a national scale. While it
gave legal standing to a mighty prin
ciple, it did not provide either the
means or the machinery of fufill
ment. Two generations later, we find
Daniel Webster paying his tribute to
its fundamental value:
Lick Observatory Has Helped Make America
World Leader in Astronomical Research
LICK OBSERVATORY
In astronomical research the Unit
ed States leads the world. The Lick
Observatory, illustrated above, locat
ed on Mount Hamilton near San Jose.
California, is one of the largest in
the world. The discoveries made
from this point have done much to
Jilace the United States in the fore
ront of astronomical science. There
are more observatories in this coun
try than in any other in the entire
THE FIERY CROSS
“I doubt whether one single
law of any lawgiver, ancient or
modern, has produced effects of
more distinct, marked and last
ing character than the Ordinance
of 1787. ... It set forth and
declared it to be a high and bind
ing duty of government to sup
port schools and advance the
means of education.”
The greatest American tragedy was
not unfolded upon any battle field,
or in any series of catastrophies. It
exists in the fact that neither the ad
vice of Washington nor the spirit of
this ordinance were carried out. That
was why Daniel Webster referred to
it. In 1866. seventy-nine years after,
James A. Garfield, later to occupy
the White House, presented to con
gress an Education Association Me
morial from which I quote:
“Your memorialists beg leave
to express their earnest belief
that universal education next to
universal liberty, is a matter of
deep national concern. Our ex
periment of republican institu
tions is not upon the scale of a
petty municipality or state, but
it covers haif a continent and
embraces peoples of widely di
verse interests and conditions,
but who are to continue “one and
inseparable.” Every condition of
our perpetuity and progress as a
nation adds emphasis to the re
mark of Montesquieu, 'lt is in a
republican government that the
whole power of education Is re
quired.
The occasion of that memorial was
the fight for more adequate public
school education then engaging the
attention of thoughtful, patriotic
Americans. Of that attempt I shall
speak later. I refer to it here be
cause you should understand that this
present battle began two generations
ago, and also that at no time, from
Washington to Lincoln, or since, have
the educational facilities of the na
tion been more than a beginning of
what were required for the safety
and advancement of a great republic.
In his remarkable book on “Child
Labor and the Constitution,” Mr.
Raymond G. Fuller says:
“What nation shall be great
est among the nations of the
‘New World’? That nation shall
be greatest that puts children
first in its thought, in its poli
tics, in its economics, in its eth
ics. The nation that accepts the
leadership of little children and
sets them in the midst of its
counselors, that nation will lead
all others in the health, intelli
gence, morality, efficiency and
happiness of its citizens and in
national prosperity, both materi
al and spiritual. On the quality
of nations international peace
and progress depend.”
To show the extent of our failure,
I present the opinion of Dr. Alexan
der J. Inglis, Professor of Education
at Harvard University, who said in
1922:
“In the first place let us rec
ognize that in all parts of this
country public education is very,
very far from being that which
we should all like to see it, that
in parts of the country it is al
most unbelievably bad, that voca
tional education has scarcely be
gun to be recognized, that the
amount of illiteracy and near-il
literacy is alarmingly great, that
attention to physical education
throughout the country is almost
negligible, that our large for
eign population constitutes a
serious problem for education and
for society, that most country
children ao not have anything
like a fair opportunity for edu
cation, that in many sections of
the country short school terms
make effective education all but

impossible, that a large part of
our teachers lack proper educa
tion, training and experience—let
us recognize all these and many
other defects of education too
numerous to catalog. They are
conditions which cry aloud for
reform in the appealing voices of
children deprived of their rights
as American citizens. They are
undoubted and indubitable facts
which cannot be ignored.”
Why a Department of Education
Mr. Inglis here speaks of “the de
fects of education too numerous to
catalog.” My serious study of the
whole problem suggests one funda
mental difficulty that is not in any
catalog, a handicap that goes back
to the beginning of the public school
system. In fact, who among you can
say when, or how, our public school
system began? The public school is
the most essential of all American
institutions; we all know that; yet,
unlike any other great American in
stitution. it did not come into exist
ence with clearly defined, distinctive
character. No date or event marks
its birth. No national document ever
bestowed upon it specific principles
and purposes. Nor was the basic
questian of its relation to government
ever fully and finally determined.
“I mention these things to
show that in this country public
school education was never right
ly honored by a place in any or
ganic act like the Declaration of
Independence, or the Constitu
tion; nor was it ever, for more
than the briefest time, given de
served recognition in any out
standing federal enactment. It
just grew, in almost haphazard
fashion, through a kind of va
grant evolution, into what it is
today, with only about one-sev
enth of the efficiency that our
national needs demand.”
For centuries education was ex
clusively of, by and for the church.
That was yet quite largely the situa
tion throughout Europe at the time
of American colonization. The first
evidence of change was in Holland and
Scotland, and among the Puritans and
Huguenots of England and France.
Those earlttest liberals had a vision
of universal education, but there re
mained in their minds the idea of
religious objective.
Then, in the eighteenth century,
philanthropy took an interest in edu
cation. Next there were charity
schools. After that, thank God, came
the conception of the American com
mon school, emerging slowly and un
certainly, because, as I have shown,
it was an organic orphan, and had to
shift for itself.
As the colonies differed, so did
their schools. But gradually Ameri
can education took on a type of its
own, although it was not until three
quarters of a century after the birth
of the republic that the public school,
as we now know it, was at all firm
ly established.
No one will deny that it was al
ways the intention to have adequate
education in America. Private and
public declarations of that high pur
pose are abundant; but the trouble
was, and is, that the cause of pub
lic education was never given the
sanction and standing, yea, and the
security, that could be obtained only
through basic legal recognition of its
paramount importance.
Pennsylvania offers a good illustra
tion. Notwithstanding William
Penn’s original requirement that the
governor and council “should estab
lish and support public schools,” plus
the statesmanly efforts of Benjamin
Franklin, it waj not until 1836 that
this commonwealth had a partly tax
supported public school system, and
for the next two years there was such
a clamor of objection as to threaten
its overthrow.
The truth is that half our national
life was lived without a general pub
lic school system ,and that, during
the last half, public schools have been
pitifully inadequate, to which fail
ures can be traced most of the na
tional ills that now beset us.
At the half-way mark two of our
greatest Americans entered the arena
of battle for this cause. They were
Horace Mann of Massachusetts and
Henry Barnard of Connecticut. To
them America owes the highest,
grandest monuments ever erected to
her most deserving heroes.
Out of their statesmanship and the
labors of others of that period came
the effort to give public school edu
cation the standing it should have
had in the beginning. In 1867, James
A. Garfield sponsored legislation to
create a department of education.
Henry Barnard became the commis
sioner of education, but without a
place in the cabinet. The clock of
true progress for America was set
back, not days, but decades. In ad
dition to executive duties, this law
imposed upon that office the task of
investigating the disposition and mis
use of previous national land grants
in aid of education. There ensued a
fight on the part of the secretary of
the interior for the right to make
the investigations, because his depart
ment had handled the grants. It was
like the story of political manipula
tion, and probably graft, that is en
gaging the public mind today. Poli
tics prevailed. The department of
education was demoted to a mere bu
reau under the secretary of the in
terior, which it has remained since.
The big thing, the fundamental, all
important thing, to be accomplished
for the cause of democratic educa
tion in America is to give it the rec
ognition, the dignity, the established
standing, of a high place in the cab
inet.
We are supporting a program that
will do two things: (1) Establish a
Department of Education, with t
cabinet secretary at its head; and
(2) Give national aid to our public
schools.
The first object far outweighs the
second. It is fundamental, organic,
whereas the rest is a matter of effi
ciency.
If there be the slightest doubt as
to what a department of education
would mean to the public school sys
tem, that doubt will disappear when
you understand the attitude toward
it of the enemies of democratic edu
cation. In a few minutes I shall dis
cuss the forces, or rather the only
organized force, that is opposing the
American public school system. At
this point I desire only to show that
this opposition by the Roman Cath
olic church hierarchy is aimed chief
ly at the idea of a department of ed
ucation. That is what they fear.
You will remember that there was
little activity in behalf of the Smith-
Towner bill during the Sixty-seventh
congress, because of the pending
measure to establish a department of
public welfare, with education only
a bureau in it. With respect to that
situation. I quote in part a letter,
issued on May 4. 1921, by the Nation
al Catholic Welfare Council, as fol
lows:
“It should further be noted
that other measures are now un
der consideration by the leaders
in congress, which may obviate
the need of opposition to the
Towner bill. Snould the McCor
mick bill, e. g.—be passed and
the department of public welfare
established, the bureau of educa
tion would simply be transferred
from the department of t”he in
terior to the department of pub
lic welfare; it would not be erect
ed into a separate department.
In that case, the situation would
practically be what it is at pres
ent.”
In other words, the hierarchy does
not oppose legislation that leaves
matters as they are, with a poor,
powerless, undignified bureau of ed
ucation. instead of a department of
education, which would at once and
forever suggest to every American
that at last our public schools had
been given the recognition and stand
ing that should have been their gov
ernmental position from the very be
ginning.
Therefore, I say to you that this
part of our program is the all-im
portant part; that there must be no
compromise upon this issue.
When we have given public organic
significance, as the creation of a de
part ment of education w ill do, while
that Mated act cannot alone at once
remedy the enervating results of one
hundred and thirty-five years of neg
lected duty, of wasted citizenship,
It Mill ease the national conscience
and he followed quickly by a new and
constantly accelerating educational
vigor throughout the republic. It
will mark the beginning of a rising
tide of common Intelligence, health,
and virtue among both the native
and adopted sons and daughters of
America.
The shameful Inadequacy of Educa-
The indictment is that “the defects
of education are too numerous to
catalog.” How much more impossi
ble is it to catalog the consequences
of these defects. When we face the
results of our inadequate public
school system, the situation becomes
positively appalling.
Each year, there is made for taxa
tion. an appraisement of their ma
terial wealth. An inventory, on as
exact and scientific a scale, of the
much more vital human values has
never been attempted. It happened,
however, quite incidentally, that the
nation was permitted to get a glimpse
at the menacing aftermath of educa
tional inadequacy. When our young
manhood was conscripted for service
in the great war, they were examined,
mentally and physically; tests were
made and recorded; the results are
known. At last we may look square
ly at the terrible truth about our
composite humanity, and relate its
degeneracy directly to the failure of
our school system.

From Evans* Address
on Public Education
“No one will deny that It was
always the Intention to have ade
quate education in America Pri
vate and public declarations of
that high purpose are abundant;
but the trouble was and Is, that
the cause of public education was
never given the sanction and
standing, yea and the security,
that could be obtained only
through basic legal recognition of
Its paramount Importance.”
“The truth Is that half our na
tional life was lived without a
general public school system, and
tliut, during the last half, public
schools have been pitifully Inade
quate, to which failures can be
traced most of the national ills
that now beset us.”
“We are supporting a program
that will da two things: (1) Es
tablish a Department of Educa

Its head; and (2) Give National
aid to our public schools.”
“At the present rate of dirain-
Ishment, It would take eighty-four
years to eliminate Illiteracy In
this ceuntry .taking absolute Illit
eracy figures, instead of the more
depressing army tests. If we ac
cept the latter as a basis, fully
fiTe hundred years would elapse
before Illiteracy were stamped out
of our national life.
“In the face of such facta I
maintain that ne citizen can op
pose Democratic Education in
America unless be be an un-Amer
ican enemy of our Institutions.”
“Here Is the Issue, Public school
education Is democratic education.
The tight against that system Is
being waged by and for Catholic
parochialism, which Is the es
sence of monarchy.”
“But that Is not all. In this cru
cial struggle for the Horace Mann
kind and quantity of public school
education, we are fighting a battle
bigger even than for the final sep
aration of church and state. Dem
ocracy Itself, the very like of Con
stitutional government, Is at
stake.”
“After all, education Is but the
means to an end. In a higher
sense, democracy Is but the means
to an end. In the highest sense,
civilization Itself Is but the means
to an end. That end Is the tri
umph of truth, God's truth and
man's truth, out of which alone
can come the Heavenly blessing of
a harmonized humanity here on
earth.”
