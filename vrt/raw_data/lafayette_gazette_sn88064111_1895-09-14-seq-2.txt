btll' I do' not know that covering
hurts them. I have ahd but little
actu~l aexierience in- iber cultire
outside of the .Spanish goober, which
is a very prolific and hardy kind, be
ing no more trouble to cultivate than ,
a cow pea, and ext.imel' } efly.
Ninety days is all theltime -neuery
to produce as many bushels of goober
per acre and two tons of hay, equal to
elpver, on land too sandy for clover,
and that would not prodaee pver 1
thirty bushels of corn. And there is 1
no stock I have evgr tried that does 1
not prefer the goobers to corn or any I
other hay. Now, when we consider 1
how cheaply they can be made and
harvested, and how that even when all
goobea and vines are removed the
land-is improved and leoft in finest con-.
dition for fall crops of any kind, is it
not strange they are not more exten
sively cultivated, both north and south?
The time for planting and cultivation
is about the same as for beansq They a
i are harvested by pulling up the vines.
All the goobers hang on to the vines
and come up with them. They can be
left to cure one day and then stacked
as peavine hay; or the pulling up of the
Ivines can extend over two or three
weeks' time and they be cured in the
loft; or by placing .alternate- layers
of dry straw or hay they can
1 be cured in the loft, and the straw or
hay be somewhat improved by the
I vines; or the vines can be grazed
off by cattle, and goobers rooted out
and eaten by hogs. I shall plant near
ly all of my little upland home in Span
Sish goobers this spring, and plant the 1
same land in the Tennessee Triumph
a potato in August. The vines and goo-.
bers will be harvested- or our little
dairy, and the potatoes .for the winter
market in our little town, and for sale
in the spring for seed.
" There is.nothing upon the globe that
L will make half as cheap or sweet gol
den bitter during the winter as Span
ish goobers (feed vines with goobers
on them), cotton seed, and yam (sweet)
patatoes. And I can almost say the
same of Spanish goobers and cotton
seed alone. Our cows have been going
dry before Christmas on common hay,
meal and cotton seed. By substituting
goober hay (with goobers on) for other
hay, our cows kept up full flow of
milk until calving time this spring,
and winter butter at the south always
commands double that of spring or
summer butter.
f Irish potatoes at the south are never
sold for less than $1 per bushel between
October and March. and to-day are
selling at $2 and $2.25 per bushel. And
I there is no mistake but what we can
now make all the-potatoes at the south
the south needs, and of a most superior
quality, by planting in August seed
I from the spring crop. The trouble has
been that we could not always succeed
in getting the tubers to sprout in Au
r gust. This is now obviated -by thor
oughly preparing the land, planting
the Tennessee triumph, or fall potato,
and cutting the tubers instead of
pla'nting the small ones whole, as
a heretofore. There is surely a new era
L. dawning upon the south; this fall po

machinery, dairying.and general sheep

such as cotton, pea-vines, goobers,

PLANTING TREES.
Twenty Rules to be Observed to Insure
Snuccess.
The following twenty rules are sel f
evident to most tree planters, who, for
want of attention, break some of them,
and reminders are therefore often use.
ful:
1. A valulable sort is worth more than
merely a handsome tree. - -
2. Good, healthy, bracing roots are
of more importance than a symmetricnl
top.
S. The roots should be long and
strong enough, and the top made light
enough, to obviate any staking.
4. If the roots of a tree are frozen,
and then thawed out of the ground or
in contact with the air, the tree will
, be killed.
a 5. If frozen roots are thawed in com
pactly-pressed mellow earth, the tree
may be male to live.
t;. NaIanlure should never be placed in
contact with tile roots when setting
Sout the tree, but used for a mulch or
top-dressing.
e 7. Trees'should always be set about
Sas deep as they stood in the nursery,
or two or three inches deeper, to allow
Sfor the settling of the earth.
8. Spread out the roots nearly equally
on all sides, so as to brace the tree
well.
9. Avoid particularly any small cav
I ity next to the roots, but fill compactly
against them on all sides with fine,
Smellow earth.
10. 4 small, thrifty tree with copious
roots when set out will be a fgood bear
- ing tree sooner thlan- a large one with
mutilated roots.
11. WVatering in dry weather crusts
the surface and does not reach the
roots.
12. Young trees should not be set in
a grass lot or among any crops of
sowed grain: but the whole surface
kept clean and mellow.
13. bhriveled trees, before planting,
may be made plump by covering for
several days, compacity, with moist,
mellow eatrth.
14. If newly set ones suffer from
drought mulch thile ground about
them, and frequently sprinkle of
shower thile stems and branches.
13. The roots extend as far from the
tree as its entire heighlt; clean and
mellow cultivation should therefore
cover a circle twice as wide as its
height
16. As a general rule cultivation
should be continued for six, eight or
ten years from planting, after which
closely grazed or lawn-mowed grass
may ~e permitted with frequent top
dressing.
- 17. The amount of manuring or top
Sdressing must vary with the vigor of
the tree: young trees should grow two
Sor three feet yearly, and bearing ones
I .oae.foot or mor.- ..... .

O. ODDDER CORN. -
If weed to PFIt a silo It aIWirtnu 4ee eaed I
. Prodt to, jae Farmer. L
Fodder corn, either to ke cut up and
storedin a mlb, or .io :be cured and ftd
dry, has become" a reguler crop with
many farmers. The latest conclusions
dratn from their-prjatical experience,
and .from. fareflly-conducted experi- i
ments made at some of the agricul- i
tural experiment stations, are that the I
best. results crn usually be obtained
by.planting a good variety of common
field corn, drilling in rows from three
to four feet apart, the graitis being
dropped about six inches apart, culti- .l
vating it thoroughly and cutting it
up when the plant and ear are fully 1
developed, and the grains are glazing. I
heretofore it has been generally
recommended to plant for ensilage
the "r rge-growing southern varieties
of oorn, on -account of the very large
amount of fodder they produce. But it
has been demonstrated that the or
dinary varieties of dent corn are usa-
ally as valuable, if not superior.
While they may not produce much
more than half the bulk of fodder
produced by the mammoth varieties,
their nutritive value isa much higher,
they mature'earlier in the season, and
the labor of handling the crop is much
less, so that in the end they are justas
profitable to raise.
Let, every farmer who has been
thinking about building a silo, and is
yet undecided, go ahead and plant the
crop.-intended for ensilage, and ,
later on, he decides not build a silo,
he can use the crop to good advantage
in the form of cured fodder corn.
From the great and increasing inter
est manifested on the saebject during
the past few months it is reasonable to
estimate that the number of silos in the
Ohio valley will be doubled the coming
season.
The silo means a decided change in
our present system of agriculture. It
means more live stock onthe farm, and
cheaper meat and dairy products. It
means a less acreage of grain, but a
higher yield per acre from increased
fertility of the soil. It means increased
profits to the farm by lowering the cost
of production. The silo is a good
mortgage lifter.--Southern Farm.
- A Vital Quesstion.
fHow to get most profit from our im
mense crop of corn is now a vital ques
tion with Texas farmers. No matter
how high the price may be, selling it
straight will not give the greatest
profit. The man who buys it must
have a profit also. He divides the profit
with the farmer, but not in the middle.
The farmer in the transaction will get
the smaller pile every time. Togetthe
most profit from a crop it must be all
utilized-the fodder and the husks, as
well as the grain. If, in addition to
the farmer's profit in producing the
crop he can add the feeder's profit, he
will be going at it right. To do this
lie must buy cattle or hogs if lie has
neglected to raise them, or if he
has not *raised enough, let hun
buy a steer or two, or enough to make
a car load; or the sate with hogs. Blut
in doing this he must exercise judg
ment. Some steers and some hogs are
not worth buying. Get stock that will
know what to do with food when they
get it-that can cat it at a profit. No
mnan can feed cattle or hogs as profita
bly as the farmer who grows the feed,
because there is the pasture that would
otherwise be Wasted, and there are
e odds and ends that may be consumed
at home that could not be sold. When
- farmers turn their attention to the con
- sumption as well as the production of
stock food, they will begin to reap the
legitimate profits of their business.-

It is claimed that the Pekin duck
will thrive well without ponds. It is
true that the ducklings can be more
easily raised away from ponds or
streams than when allowed to Ihave
access thereto, but this due to the fact
that most of the ducklings are hatched
with incubators during the winter sea

I would chill them and cause loss
Young ducks will thrive better if they
are kept away from the ponds until

a experience is that tile adult ducks are
