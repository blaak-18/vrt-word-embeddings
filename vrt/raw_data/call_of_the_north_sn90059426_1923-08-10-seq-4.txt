JESUS OF NAZARETH
(Continued from page 3)
his death certificate was made out in
the name of Jesus and likewise was
his burial certificate. Then his , es
tate was settled in the name of Jesus.
Get away from the man of Nazareth!
Impossible! That young man from
Nazareth followed Ingersoll all the
way, had his hand on his shoulder and
was saying all the time, though In
gersoll did not hear: “Bob, you're
a fool. You can’t get away from
me!”
J. am a stranger in your city, but I
am certain that not very far from
here there is a building wherein peo
ple worship, and that those who wor
ship in that building do not recognize
Jesus in their worship. Should you
ask them the question, “What do you
think of Jesus of Nazareth?” and
they should answer it honestly, they
would say that Jesus of Nazareth was
an impostor. And should you ask
them, “an yCou accept Him as more
than man?” they would answer “No.”
Nevertheless, the fact remains that
their synagogue was contracted for
and erected in the name of Jesus.
Every ton of coal is shoveled into
that synagogue cellar in the name of
Jesus, and even the Rabbi’s salary
check is made out in the name of
Jesus. Where is the Jew in all the
world who can consistently decline to
recognize Jesus of Nazareth? Jews,
like all others,'must recognize Him
every day. They, too, must be buried
in His name and their estates must
be settled in His name.
The Christian Calendar
The Christian calendar is powerful
the world around. There are num
erous calendars, the Jewish and oth
ers, all religious, but not one of them
legal. In Turkey, where Mohammed
is the prophet, the Christian calendar
prevails. In India, where they wor
ship Buddha, and in China, where
they worship Confucius, business is
transacted in the name of Jesus and
the governments are run in the name
of Jesus. “B. C.” “A. D.” All time,
so far as man knows it, leans against
Jesus of Nazareth. Yet our mod
ernists declare that he was only a
man like other men and should be
classed with the world’s great teach
ers. Where is Socrates? Where is
Plato? Where is Confucius? Why,
I ask, if Jesus must take his place
with them, has not one of those
teachers, who lived to be old and en
joyed the best educational advantages
of his day and wrote so much—why has
not one of those said to the world:
“You must commemorate my birth
day.” Why has not one of those
presided in studios of music and
painting, and dominated literature,
and forced the world to transact its
business and run its governments in
his name. Writings of those great
teachers are extant, they are in book
form and we have them in our li
braries, but even their teachings must
be published and distributed in the
name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Rests Case
I could dwell at length upon the
authority of Jesus in the lives of
millions, who accept him as their
Savior. I could talk to you for a
while about the day we call Sunday,
and I could submit other evidence,
but I rest the case. The facts to
which I have referred, known to all,
young and old, facts that cannot be
contradicted by anyone, declare as
emphatically as does the Bible that
Jesus of Nazareth was and is more
than man, and if Jesus be more than
man, there is only one conclusion for
the finite mind to grasp—He is
Deity.
I now open the Bible again and read
about Jesus of Nazareth, nor do I find
difficulty in believing what I read:
“In the beginning was the Word and
the Word was with God and the
''•vord was God And the Word
was made flesh and dwelt among us.”
The teachings of Jesus will spread
and prevail until every tongue shall
confess Him and every knee shall
bow to Him.
Jesus of Nazareth! Behold Him
standing on Mount Olivet, and shout
ing down through the centuries:
“All power is given unto me, in heav
en and in earth. Hear him! Believe
him!
‘Jesus shall reign wherever the sun
Does his successful journey run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to
shore,
’Till moons shall wax and wane no
more.”
“Swords shall be beaten into plow
shares and spear 3 into pruning hooks,
and the nations shall learn war no
more.”
‘The desert places shall blossom as
the rose.”
Sin will ultimately be driven from
the earth.
“The tabernacle of God is with
men.”
“God is in Christ, reconcilng the
the world unto Himself.”
“All hail the power of Jesus’ name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown him Lord of all.”

WHO FOUNDED THIS REPUBLIC?
INTERESTING HISTORICAL FACTS THATI ARE
NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.
By Col. J. ARTHUR PETERSEN.
Masons founded this Republic. The
information given in this article is
true, from the best information I can
gather from records.
Paul Revere was a Mason. Robert
Newman, who hung the lantern in the
old North Church, was a Mason. So
was William Dawes, who gave the
alarm by way of Roxbury. Patrick
Henry, that great patriot, was a
Mason. James Otis, Samuel Adams,
John Quincy and Joseph Warren,
who, with Otis and Revere, laid plans
for the revolution at the Green drag
on Inn.
The plan for the famous Boston
Tea party was perfected in the home
of a Mason and a member of St. An
drew’s Lodge, A. F. and A. M., head
ed by Paul Revere.
Of the fifty-six signers of the Dec
laration of Independence, all but six
were Masons. The men who drafted
the Declaration were John Adams,
Benjamin Franklin, Roger Jefferson
of Connecticut, Robert Livingston,
Thomas Jefferson and Richard Lee,
all Masons.
In the Constitutional Convention,
out of fifty-five members, fifty were
Masons. Our first President, George
Washington, was himself a Mason.
The Governors of all thirteen
states at this time were Masonq.
Marquis de La Layette, to whom the
Knights of Columbus erected a statue
in France as a sop to lead the French
Republic back under the rule of the
Pope, was a Mason, and made this
statement: “If the liberties of the
American people are ever destroyed,
it will be by power of the Roman
clergy.”
Of the twenty-nine Major Generals
in Washington’s army, twenty were
Masons. In the whole list of Wash
ington’s Brigadier Generals, number
ing over sixty-one, Stephen Moylon
was not a Mason. Ethan Allen was
a Mason. Captain Corcoran, of
Allen’s Green Mountain Boys, was a
Mason. Col. William Burton and
Henderson, the hero of Harlem
Heights, were Masons. Robert Mor
ris, the financier of the Revolution,
was a Mason. So was Haym Solo
man, a Polish Jew, who is said to
have given upwards of $650,000 to
the support of America in her great
sthruggle for liberty. John Marshall,
Alexander Hamilton and James Mad
ison were Masons.
The Roman Catholic Irish that
make so much noise, and so many
false statements through the press
and in books, of what they have done
to make America free, did not (as
records show) start to come over to
this country until the potao famine
in Ireland. A the time of the Revo
lution nearly all the Irish here were
Protestants, one-third of the popula
tion of Pennsylvania were Irish Prot
estants. Bunker Hill was named by
SEVEN OBSTACLES
TO CO-OPERATION
You Find the Types in Every Com-
munity.
By W. E. HALBROOK,
Chotaw, Ark.
In the rural communities where I
work we have seven prominent char
acters whose early individuality
training failed to fit them adequately
for the new era of co-operation.
The first I denominate as “Squire
Bell Wether,” a man who has been
allowed to dominate the affairs of
his vicinity for a generation. He is
frequently surrounded by a coterie
of sons, sons-in-law, and renters, who
readily gravitate about this core of
human dictation. His offspring are
in the rural school, to be molded into
social factors.
Second is his brother-in-law, Mr.
“Rule-or-Ruin.” This character is
more blustery and bloodthirsty, a
braggadocio, who takes a delight in
“bustin’ things up,” especially if he
was not previously . consulted. His
offspring are in the school, to be
molded into social factors.
Third is Mr. “Party San,” the man
who glories in the form of his own
political party, who considers all oth
ers rascals, and has had so many tilts
with his neighbors during elections
that harmony on any community pro
position is precluded. His offspring
are in the school, to be molded into
social factors.
Fourth is Mr. “Modern Pharisee,”
a cousin to “Party San.” He pins
everything to the creed of his church,
and has no use for those who hold to
any other. He will not tolerate the
selection of any of those other sects
as a factor in his community’s de
velopment. His offspring are in the
school, to be molded into social fac
tors. " \
Fifth is Mr. “Easy Goer,” who is
complimented by his neighbors as a
man who attends strictly to his own
business. Little cares he who is elect
ed director or trustee, how much
school they have, or what kind of so
ciety the community has. He never
proposes anything good, nor gives aid
to anything proposed by others.
Sometimes he says,\“lt might bei a
good thing if they would carry it out
just right.” His offspring are in the
the Protestant Irish after Bunker
Hill, just outside of Belfast, Ireland.
The Protestant Irish gave the name
Londonderry to a town in New
Hampshire. Gen. John Stark, a Prot
estant Irishman, went from London
derry and won the battle of Benning
ton, Vermont. Fanueil Hall, the
cradle of liberty, was named after a
Protestant, a French Huguenot. John
Sullivan, the Irish Protestant, stands
in the first rank among the Revolu
tionary heroes and was afterwards
three times governor of the State of
New Hampshire.
Clinton settled and named Ulster
County, New York. He was a Prot
estant Irishman. In West Virginia
practically the entire population were
Irish Protestants. The same was
true of Western North Carolina;
while South Carolina was wholly
Scotch-Irish Huguenot Protestants.
Kentucky and Tennessee were all
Scotch-Irish. On the 20th of May,
1775, the Scotch-Irish Protestant set
tlers of Mecklenburg, in North Caro
lina, first asserted the doctrine that
Americans are “A free and Inde
pendent people.”
In 1776 the Declaration of Inde
pendence was adopted and of the
fifty-six signers, fourteen were Irish
Protestants, and these are the ones
that Rome writes so much about as
being Irish, bu never tells all of the
story', THAT THEY WERE PROT
ESTANT IRISH, but want you to
think that they were Roman Catho
lics. Charles Carrol, of Maryland,
was the only Roman Catholic signer,
and the Continental Congress sent
this same Charles Carrol and Benja
min Franklin into Canada to ask as
sistance in the dark hours of the
Revolution —but the French Roman
Catholics refused any assistance
whatever because the Continental
Congress had passed resolutions cen
suring the Pope of Rome.
The Declaration of Independence,
as we have it today, is in the hand
writing of a Protestant Irishman,
Charles Thompson, the Secretary of
Congress. It was first printed by
Captain Thomas Dunlap, an > Irish
Protestant, and was first read to the
people by another Protestan Irish
man. Capt. John Nixon. Protestant
Irish furnished 39 general officers in
the Continental Army. Of these, ten
were Major Generals. General An
thony Wayne, the hero of Stony
Point; Col. John Eager Howard of
Maryland, who saved the day at Cow
pens; Gen. John Sevier of Virginia,
who won the battle of King’s Moun
tain with Scotch-Irish volunteers;
Col. Daniel Morgan, also from Vir
ginia; Gen. Sam Houston and Col.
George Rogers Clarke, were all Irish.
Yes, but please remember they were
all Protestant Irish.—American Cit
izen.
school, to be molded into social fac
tors.
Sixth is Mr. “Sour Grouch,” a pe
culiar personage. He has an acid re
action on alkalies, and an alkaline
reaction on acids. He quarrels with
his neighbors, finds fault with his
preacher, thinks something is always
wrong with the school, and nags his
children. Querulous and choleric, he
sends his offspring to the school, to
be molded into social factors.
Seventh is Mr. “Tight Fist.” He
does not particularly oppose anything
that will enhance the value of prop
erty in his community; but do not
call on him to contribute one penny.
In his eye, book companies are rob
bers, teachers asking S4O are extor
tionate, preachers are living alto
gether for the money, and the whole
world is “on the beat.” His offspring
are in the school, to be molded into
social factors.
These seven characters with “Sis
ter Telltale” as disseminator, consti
tute the raw material of the hills.
Somehow their individualistic traits
must be 1 utilized for the benefit of
society in his co-operative age, and
the training must be given in the
school.
BE STRONG
Be strong! my soul, the race demands
That truth be lifted high;
That right be sponsored, wrong de
throned,
And every evil die.
The call is to the one who glows
With courage, faith and love,
Whose soul is pulsing with the thrill
Of visions from above.
The cloud of witness around
Holds us in full review;
Impediments are all cast down,
While we the goal pursue.
With patience, then, the race renew,
With vigor and emprise;
Our Captain will inspire anew
The perfect sacrifice.
It is said that we are creatures of
circumstance, but we sometimes for
get that lots of us make our own cir
cumstances.
What most young Americans seem
to want is a job that will enable them
to loaf eight or ten hours a day in
stead of six.
THE CALL OF THE NORTH
NOT A STATE’S
RIGHTS ISSUE
NEW YORK STATE
HAS NOT SECEDED
A queer thing to raise the issue
of states’ rights upon, is the prohi
bition of the liquor traffic.
All through the argument in be
half of the action of the New York
legislature and the governor, runs
the notion that in some way the Fed
eral Government has infringed upon
the rights of the states. And even
from sources where you would ex
pect accurate information, comes the
intimation that we are to put states’
rights to a new test. \
This is all nonsense. In no other
matter now coming under the juris
diction of the Federal Government is
there a more complete relinquishment
of the domestic authority. The pro
hibition amendment to the Federal
Constitution has been ratified in a
constitutional way. It is a part of
the fundamental law, binding upon
every state in the Union. No issue of
states’ rights can be raised against
it. It would be just as rational for
any state now to assume the author
ity to inaugurate its own postal sys
tem, or to issue its own money, or
to maintain its own customs house,
or to re-institute slavery.
This cry of states’ rights from some
quarters is a scheme to throw dust in
the eyes of the populace. In point of
fact, it makes no legal difference
whether New York has an enforce
ment statute or does not have one.
The Federal law is supreme. The
right to make the law was granted by
the states of the Union to the na
tional Congress. The national Con
gress passed the statute to carry out
the provisions of the Constitutional
amendment. The law thus passed has
been thrice tested before the Supreme
Court of the United States; and it has
been declared to be in spirit and in
form accordant to the Constitution.
No state, -therefore, can object to it
legally; and no state by action or in
action, either of its legislature, its
judicial or its executive branch of
government, can interfere with the
enforcement of the statute. The Fed
eral power is supreme and sufficient.
The national Government has the law
on its side and it has the physical
force. -a
The position taken by New York
does not affect in any degree the pre
rogative of the Federal Government.
Suppose New York were to pass a law
setting up custom houses around her
borders under which attempt would
be made to collect duties on commerce
passing from other states into her
lines. The statute would be a foozle
and a fraud and would be so decided
by the Supreme Court of the United
States. The issue of states’ rights
would have to be tried then although
the decision would be a foregone con
clusion. But there is no question or
issue of states’ rights in the present
case, for New York has not even at
tempted to pass a law to legalize the
manufacture, the sale and the trans
portation of intoxicating beverages, in
defiance of the Constitution and the
statute of the United States.
Let us keep this question on the
plain ground of fact. New York has
not seceded from the Union. She has
not attempted by her law to nulify
the Federal statute and Constitution.
She has sought only to express her
vicious whim against prohibition. And
her action is merely sticking out a
spiteful tongue against national au
thority. It has no effect whatever
and it cannot even raise any authori
tive legal discussion on the issue of
states’ rights.—The Christian States
man.
JUST COMMON FAULTS
We move in disguise. Too often
the heart falsely reveals itself. We
are not exactly what we seem to be.
That character is more than reputa
tion is sometimes forgotten. Hu
man action is a delusive finger
board. Many a victory is unherald
ed; many a defeat disowned. Peace
ful countenances often cover restless
hearts.
We are disposed to overlook the
smaller sins—weights and faults—
solely because of their insignificance.
There is, they say, a small fire-fly
that infests the regions near light
houses. They come one by one, fast
ening to the globe of the great light.
One might not affect the destiny of
unforunate crews; but, though com
ing singley, after awhile the lamp is
covered and shuts out the shining
light. Then this is to be discovered
from -without, The keeper within
says his lamp is trimmed and burn
ing. Faults, simple and small in
their consequence, may accumulate
until divine light is obstructed. And

INDIANA'S ANSWER
(From the Oklahoma Herald)
Without question Indiana, in point
of enthusiasm, prestige and" numbers,
carries the Klim banner. The growth
o the order in Hoosierdom has been
the wonder of all Klandom. There
has
been harmony from the very be
ginning and there is harmony now.
There has been wise leadership.
There are said to be four hundred
thousand Klansmen in the state.
This is, perhaps, an exaggeration,
but The Fiery Cross, the most suc
cessful newspaper devoted to Klan
interests in the United States, ac
cepts that figure in explaining the
“why” of the Klan in answer to the
State Bar association which adopted
a resolution condemning the Klan but
refused to adopt one condemning
blackmailers. The Fiery Cross ex
plains “Why There Are Four Hun
dred Thousand Klansmen in Indiana”
this way:
“There is much wonderment in cer
tain quarters as to the marvelous
growth of the Ku Klux Klan in Indi
ana and throughout America. Aside
from the acts of Tolerance and'other
un-American, unjust and unlawful
acts of its enemies, the following in
cident is cited as one reason for the
phenomenal growth of this American
organization.
“On July sixth the Indiana Bar as
sociation, meeting at West Baden,
adopted a resolution condemning
400,000 Anglo-Saxon Protestant Am
erican residents of Indiana, and their
families, and refused to pass a reso
lution condemning blackmailers.
“But the Indiana lawyers always
were good politicians, some of them
politicians first and lawyers and citi
zens afterwards.
“But the Klan should worry. It
will make the few remaining real
lawyers who, since the passing of the
resolution, have not started looking
up just where to get in the Klan, also
start looking up the local Kleagle.”
