Monroe Observer: Last Tuesday pi
evening.a two-horse team ran, away bi
on Grand street. George, the driver, e
a colored man, was thrown from the an
wag6on, which fortunately was light, he
and severely injured. He was drag- tt
ged several yards and the hind wheel II
of the wagon passed over his head he- wI
fore lie could extricate himself. One tht
of the horses was killed by running w;
into a tree in front of Peters' furni
tore store. The wagon and team
were the property of Messrs. Bry & di
Muir, and was used by them for haul
ing lumber from their mill. p1
Thibodaux Sentinel: From Mr.
Squires, who collects statistics of the si
sugar crop for the N. 0. Price Cur- til
rent, the fact is obtained, that on r
fifteen sugar plantations, taken at ai
random, which yielded 4,579 hogs- A
heads of sugar in 1876, only 3,171 were ,
made in 1877, being a loss of 1,408 re
hloglsheads-about 30 per cent. Con- a
sidering the extra expense in manu- I
facturing in 1877, and the inferior a
quality of thle sugar, one can safely I
estimate the yield as less than a half I
crop. if

Our friend Mr. Jas. Cosgrove, editor b
of the People's Vindicator, published 4
in Natchitoelhes, is in thie city in the 11
interest of his excellent paper. Thie J
Vindicator, throngh all our long
struggle with Radicalism, was in fore
front of the battle and was a power,
as it still is, throughout thie Redl river
region of Louisiana. We regard' tlhe'
Vindicator as one of thie heat country
pa~frtiribted in te Sonth, and we I
knhw that it is a paper which repre- e
sents its large constituency and thlet
great material interests of thle sec
tion in whlichl it circulates. The mer- 1
chants of our city should give it a
liberal patronage, and the menmbers
of thle 'egislature and our public men
generally who desire to be en rapport

. Eellpses for 1878.
There will be four eclipses during
the year 1877, two of each luminary,
as follows:
An annular eclipse of tile sun near
2 o'elock in the morning of February
2, which will, therefore, be invisible
to the people on this part of the earth's
sortace. It will be partially visible
from nearly the whole of Australia,
but from neithlerof the continents its
northern limits being south of the
southernmost capes of Asia and
Africa.
A partial eclipse of the moon in the
mornnon of February 17, visible from
the Unsted States. Tile moon will
enter the earth's shadow at 3h. 52ra1.
a. in., and leave it at 6h. 48um. a m.
At 5h. 21m. the middle of the eclipse,
0,84 of the moon's diameter will be
obscured. Tihe tinle is not favorable
for general observation from this sec
lion.
A total eclipse of the sun July 29,
visible to all parts of North America.
The line of totallity runs through
Kamsebhatka, Behlring's straits, Alas
ka, British America, Western Mon
tana, Western Wyoming, Western
Colorado, passiog about one degree
roathwest of Danver City, and across
Texas to the gulf of Mexico, near
Galveston city.
A partial eclipse of the moon in the
afternoon and evening of August 12.
Thbe moon will enter the shlodow at
4h. 50m. p. m., being tllen below Ilte
horizon, and will leave it at 7h1. 44nm.
p. m. when she will be little more
than half an heour high.

AMONGC( the FARIMERS L. C
Tobacco leaves are fatal to cows, as
a Kentucky farmer learned a few days
ago by losing three valuable animals
wich ate some of the weed. with their Fil
hay.
P,,tato-balls as seed: Plant the G 1
balls in good rich earth, and keep
theml free froml weeds. The first crop FAL
of potatoes will be marvelously siall, direct
many ;o larger than peas; tile second et
clop will be better, and the third of ketsn
full size. You will probably have hits 1)RY
of vas itieies of potatoes, and very like
ly none like those from which the seed (
was taken.
The following is said to be a good
process for keeping fi nit fresh through
the winter: .Mix rosin two pound-,
tallow two oullnces, beeswax two oUn
ces, sl ,wly over a fire in an iron pot,
ihot do not biil. ]1ib each fruit sepa
rately with palveiized chalk and dillp
I it in the mixture. 1ldhu it up for a W
inoluelit to permiit the coating to set,
and pack avway cauirefully in a cool
plilace.
Incoming COWS, illire especially I, 6
those thst are high-bred, and have A
been well fed, should be jndicioiusly All a
s starved for two or three weeks previ- ORI
s Ill to calving, and for a week after it.
Feed such cows only on dry hay, or
partly hay and partly cut straw, with C.,
a little bran and a hlanidful of salt.- piet
'f The miilking of an incolnilng cow, just satin
I previous to her calving, should be
avoiided, as tending to iunduly stimln- try iI
' late the organs and produllce the very
trouble that is sought to be prevent- -
- ed.
I Ecr, OSNT~rNT.---ThC oil obtained
' froim the yolks of eggs is credited with
wonderful healing propecrties in cases
of cats, brnises and the like by same
of the Eastern nations. ''The(! eggs are
e first boiled hard, when the yolk is ea
In sily removed. Crushed anid carefully

Il ates, when it is ready for use. The
ill eggs of water-fowls have tile most oil,
I- but that obtained fromn tile eggs of the r

best, so says the Druggist Circular. thi
a PRESERVING BEEF iY FREEZING.- lwi
nt For keeping beef perfectly sweet for Th
,r, using fresh, the following method is
rt recolnmeded by ia New York State
ill farmer: "Cut the beef in pieces to
ie suit your convenience, expose it where cor
it will freeze very solid, wrap each
piece in a separate piece of paper, se
SY curing it with twine, and bury in a
tY bin of wheat. If you have no wheat,
'+ peas, barley or any other heavy will
le answer ia good purpose. I have kept
it,. heef fresh and sweet in this way from
g- the 1st of January to the lst of April. B11
gel I have had sonic beef kept in this way
we- which was better and more tender on LA
no the 1st of April than on the week it
ng was killed."
ni
tm In order to keep fruit, several con
ul ditions are important. In the first
place, the atmosphere of a fruit-room
should be dry; there shold be no mole
dampness than exists in the cold out
he side air. Thl room should be suscep
ir- tible of ventilation in proper weather, rut
on not by direct currents of air, but by
air modified before it reaches the fruit. C
SA fruit-roomni iust be frost-proof; it
re must be cleanly and accessible. As
108 regards locatiou, it may be placed on
n- a side hill, thie excavation opening to
' tie south; or it may be placed under GI
ior a barn or stable, or other outbuilding.
ly It is not well to store large quantities
alf of fruit in rooms under dwellings,eveni
if they are adaptedl to thie keeping of
the fruit. The hygiene of fiamilies "
must ilot be jeopardized by the possi- a
tor bility of evil results arising from tihe
hed decay or fermentation of vegetables p
the in rooms under family apartments.

o"g Working horses twenty-five years
rer, old are very rare, and yet at this age
iver a horse may lie vigorous, and useful.
t ile TIre duration of a hiorse's.life is thirty
rtry years, if hie is well cared for, and ill

pre- expected trorn him. A large prolor
t ire tion of horses are ruinied before they
ec- are five years old by overwork, im
rer-proper feeding, neglect and abuse.
it a Neglect arnd improper feeding find
bers more victims than overwork, for if a
men horse in hIis prime is properly fed and
port cared for he can scarcely be hurt by
culd steady work. Food should be given
regularly as to time and qnantity. A
hur'se has a comparatively smnall stom
ach. Five pounds of cut hay and 3
quarts of ground feed should make a
ring tll feed for a large horse. Horses
thart are worked on thle road at more

hay reduced to three pounds anid have
near four quarts of the feed. If thie feed is

alia, Fowls in Winter.
a its Farmers are, perhaps, more negli
i gent of their poultry in winter than
of any other department of their flrm.
StIre This should not he so. If properly
from cared tor the profits arising from this
will source are quite as great, in propor
imr. tion to expense, as that from any oth
a erdepartment. First a war-m house
ip should be provided, which ean be put

ec-winter. In thie aibsence of water they
eat snow, but this is injurious. It is
useless to complain that your hens
