AN IPORTANTI CIRCULAR.
bSeas e u by the NatleUal
of I(:edII
The Excutive Committee of the Na
tioral Board of Health invites the at
teatioa of aSl 8ato nd muaicipal seth
oritics and sanitary organizations to the I
ftat that they abould aithout. delay eu
deavor to secure the bhet uanitary son. b
dition of places and people under their b
charge. Whatever opinions may be held u
as to the auneesof yellow fever and of fi
the recent appearance of that diseasen in
Tenessee and Mississippi, it is wise to
act as if it were a disease du to spe
sie psticular easu, which Isb apb le
of growth and reproduction, transport
able, and may be destroyed by exposure '
to temperatures above 950o athresheit, Sa
e by oemiale disiufectants of sacient a
streagth, f brought into immnndiate coo- r
tact. It is ale prudent to assume that
the growth and reproductions of this j
cause are connected with the presence
of tilth, in the sanitary senes of that
word including decaying organic mnat- t
ter and dleective ventilation, as well as b
of high temperature. The caes of yel- a
low fever recently observed should be d
considered as due to causme srviving p
from last year's epidemic, and not to sre
cent importation from other countries. h
It follows that there is a liability to ap
pearanoe of other cases in place visited
y the epidemic of last year, aud that
there is da r of the spreat et the t
disease to the North and East. The ob- '
jecs of the present circular is to advise el
that all cities, towns and villages be at
once made elenm in a asuitary point of a
view The nirt step towards securing ,
cleanlness is to obtain reliable informa
tion as to what parts of the place are
clean and what fooul. The resualts of
careful sanitary inspection in almost any a
city or town will show the existence of
decaying and ofensive matters, previos
ly unknown and which every one will a
admit should be promptly removed and
destroyed. Such inspection, to be of
value, must be thorough and made by
persona eompetent to reogise fal sils, .,
water and air, a. well as the grimser and
uore palpable forms of nuisance. They
should also be made by persos who -
wmeld report fully and frankly the re- I+
nnlts of their observations without re- I
fe ence to the wishes of persona or car I
porations. When the wheresetbo s and
extent of the evil is knows the remedy
is usually almost elfvkident. Ti Ie -
tional Eaid of Health will furnish, on
request, blauk forms naguide for such I
inspections.
