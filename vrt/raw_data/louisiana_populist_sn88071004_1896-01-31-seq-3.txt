'-How Can We Defeat the Pop- N
uiists ?" U
The Mineral Well' lHerall, a
democratic Ial'r, is coming to be
somewhat shaky over the pro.s
pects of democratic success in its
county and asks the above ques
s- tion, following it up with these re
marks: Note well the sentiment A
of the democrats as voiced by the A
t Herald :
At the last election the populists 11
had almost a majority vote in the Il
county. We ar' led to believe that lI
they have increased their votin;z
7 strength since last election and un- 0
, less something (,can he done to break
their strength before next election C
they will carry the county.
n To call democrats Coxcyites and C
c fanatics or to post notices "keel)
off the grass" will have hut little I)
e effect, but it might work different F
It with the Populists. We have one
of these posters "keep off the F
grass" and may possibly use it do
ring the next carlpaign if it c:in he
e used with any good effect on the ,y
e Populists. This scheme, however, J
-C my. fail, and in that event of fail- L
ure there remain bult one other L
method that will insure the coun- L
"e try against the misrule anl fanati- y
cism of the Popuhsts, and that is to I
le count the vote and declare the re- N
sult of the election. 1
True, the Pops might seek to
compel the counting of the vote by :;
, suing out a writ of mandamus, 41
but this could not he made final 51
until the March term of the court.
a and then an appeal could be ta
ken and the case kept in court un
til the "grass" greyv on the Popu- 14
list graves. How would thisscheme 1
1- 1
work ?----Dublin Progress.
11 The Democratic party (lies hard, 1
but jt has got some gentlemen in it 1
yet, who ought to protect them- 11
d selves from such infamy as the 1
above, by denouncing it.
Bro. Hicks says-"Some of the H
Populist editors are like bass drums 11
1 is a brasb hand, they make a heap H
is of noire if they do furnish -hlittle b
Sums" Well, Bro. Hicks, if you S
knmew much about the late war you S
would know that the sound of the q
Sb dras was the sound by which S
Sthe well disciplined soldier kept b
a step ari teomrades. When the a
corammhar gave the word march S
the iheW dram.g ae the "timd" e
and no siatter what Lourishes and
varatlops the corneters like your- I
s ueitigbt put is, the soldier kept 'i
- his sep-utc, or no music. If
s, you had kept on the same line of j
f principle you started out you `
would not now be tangling up your 4
legs trying to keep time in the
w procession headed by cornets at the '
mouth of the democrats trilling \

Peoplle's Party ot Loui-iana.
1. We affirt' our allegiance to
the pure principles of popular gov
ermuent. as enunciated by Wash
ington, Jefferson and Jackson, and
emlodied in our National platform,
and we uphold the princil'le em
bodied in the immortal declaration
that this should be "a Government
of the people, by the people and
for the people."
2 And especially dtl we de
mand the free and unlimited coin
are of both gold and silver, at the
ratio of It to 1, with equal debt
paying power as primary money,
and a full legal tender monetary
system for the people of the Unit
ed States, without consultii<, any
foreign nation or money syndicatte.
3. We demand for Louisiana
industries equal protection to that TI
afforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit
ish system of commercial laws.,
that no discrimination against our
agricultural and industrial classes let
may be made.
4. We favor a just and liberal ph
system of public schools for the
benefit of all classes of our people, V
and we deplore the fact that for
many years the management of Sc
our public school system has lxben li
so defective that the party now in
power seeks to disfranchise a large N1
number of our citizens on the an
grounds of ignorance.
5. We denounce the disgrace- 3
ful and infamous election frauds to
which have prevaled in Louisiana, ea
and we demand and are determin- *
ed to have a perfectly honest and Il
fair election, at vhich each citizen ro
qualilied -to vote, thall cast his bal
lot freely and secretly, and the
vote shall be fairly counted as they
are actually cast. This is the su
preme issue in this campaign, and t
in its success the honor, manhood '
and prosperity of Louisiana are ht
involved. The foul anti hloathsome I:
methods which have brought the B
ballot box stuffer to the front, and 0i
placed him in power in Louisiana, pi
must, in the name of liberty, jus- St
tice, morality and common decen- D
cy, be suppressed.
6. We oppose and denounce the i
proposed suffrageamendment, con- of
cocted by political schemers, not to >
purify and elevate the ballot box a
but to subserve their selfish pur
poses by providing contradictory N
qualifications, to suddenly disfran- B
chise large masses of worthy citi
zens, by deluding the people with k
promises of changes in the next w
Legislature. We denounce the H
whole amendment as a vicious "
fraud which proposes measures and
methods that are un-American and it
destructive of free institutions. It
7. We favor the utmost econo- d
my of expenditures, in State, city
and parish, and pledge our candi- -
dates to a strict and impartial en
forcement of all laws, and the pres
ervation and promotion of every
interest in Louisiana,. whose wel
fare is broader and more sacred
than party lines or partisan poli
cies; and we invite and urge the
true men and honest citizens of
n Louisiana, without regard to past
8 party affiliations to join with us in
a noble, patriotic and powerful ef
eh fort to relieve our people and to
. elevate the standard of politics
ct and public morality in our beloved
State.
