AS TO THE STATE SANITARIUM.
(Continued from Page Five.)
my room and took me down to the
wire guard room and choked me
almost insensible with their hands
and then finished choking me into un
consciousness with a pair of suspen
ders. And when 1 came to my senses
they had put the window down so I
could gee no air, and had left the
room. I think this fellow’s initials
are H. E. Fleury. There are several
Fleurys there. This is the smallest
and youngest one, and was “choking”
on U hall when I left. Alex. Hawkins
was head attendant on this hall.
Let me explain here that when there
are not enough attendants on one
hall to “choke” patients to suit them,
they go out and get other attendants
and this was the case that night.
Harris was my attendant on T hall
and he went to F Ward and got
Morgan Thomson and Haddaway, to
U Ward and got Fleury and came and
choked me as I have described above.
I was again choked on this hall very
badly by one Leary, now night watch
man on the second floor, Twin build
ing and Price Johnson was second at
tendant in Leary’s place, another
famous “choker.”
I was then moved to V Ward, where
I was again choked by an attendant.
I have seen Linday Goodson of this
hall make old man Wallace, a very old
man 2 wash bis clothes and because
he did not wash them clean enough
to suit him, he often kicked and beat
the old man, and because I stood up
for this weak, sick patient and re
ported these things to the doctor, I
was a continuous target for their
abuse and insults, which .1, of course,
had to swallow without resentment.
I was then moved to R Ward and was
called in to bathe by a former at
tendant. I was too sick to bathe, but
I went in any way, and a mean epi
leptic, because I wanted to cool my
water to suit myself, tried to interfere
with me, and when I tried to protect
myself the attendants jumped on me,
threw me down on the floor, bruised
my legs and arms and beat me up in
my weak condition. They threw me
into the wire guard room, and I lay
there on the hard floor without even a
blanket to lie on for eight days, naked,
just as I came into the world. I
begged for water for two hours, my
throat being sore and parched from
the choking. I only got water three
times a day, when the food they serve
us was brought in—which should be
called swill. Cleve May, now on C
Ward, was on the hall and Fleming
Gilman head attendant. A former at
tendant came into the wire guard room
where I was one day with another
patient, tied my hands and feet to
gether and held my head under the
water a long time. I was very sick
and he nearly drowned me. I re
ported this to Dr. R. C. Swint, but
nothing was done about same. This
attendant afterwards quit of his own
accord and went to farming. I also
told Dr. Swint that I had nothing to
lie on, but he did not have them to
give me anything. I was then moved
to X Ward and I was lying on my bed
very sick one night when a mean epi
leptic came down the hall blowing
a mouth harp, and stood in front of
my door, which was closed, and when
I asked him to desist, that I had the
headache very badly, he came down
the hall to jump on me and because I
tried to protect myself, the assistant
attendant named Hichens (he is now
also farming) jumped on me and
threw me down on the floor and broke
the little finger on my right hand and
induced the patient to jump on me
also, and they both beat me to un
consciousness. I was then kept in the
wire guard ten days and taken to U
Ward.
Right here I must tell the people
what kind of head attendant is on
U hall. His name is Alex. Hawkins,
and he has been mistreating patients
for twenty or thirty years. A patient
that used to stay on the hall with
him before the Twin building was
built, named M. A. Poole, was hum
ming a song in his room one night, in
a low-toned voice, when this Alex.
Hawkins came in and began choking
him. It being dark, and the patient
not knowing who it was choking him,
he hit Hawkins with a shoe and then
Hawkins locked the door and went out
and got a crowd of attendants and
took him to the wire guard room,
choked and beat him in the face with
a shoe heel and broke his nose and his
face is now mutilated from same. If
any one doubts this, you can see
M. A. Poole at R hall at the asylum,
if he has not gone home since I was
moved from the Twin building, and
if he has, his address is Hiram, Ga.,
but I am quite sure he is at the
asylum yet.
People of Georgia, rise up and throw
off this oppression and cruelty. Do
not let your poor unfortunate sons
and daughters that should receive the
tenderest treatment be maimed and
injured for life. There is only one
way to do it, and that is to have men
to walk the wards at irregular inter
vals as spies and see that this does
not go on. The- Supervisors do not
try to stop these practices and nei
ther do the doctors. They all know
it goes on and has been going on for
years and will continue to go on unless
bonded men, sworn to do their duty,
are used as spies to walk from ward
to ward and look out for these things.
Even they are liable to get in league
with these “chokers.” The Super
visors play cards with the attendants
and encourage them in every way pos
sible to mistreat the patients, but
make no outward appearance of same.
When the Legislative Committee
comes through the buildings the shuck
mops that we keep the floors shined
with by using them’ several hours a
day are locked np and they are made
to believe we do nothing but rest. As
George Bell said in his letter to a
friend while confined there, “If any
one should become interested enough
to make an investigation here, or visit
a relative or friend, let him not be
deceived by the pleasant pretences,
suave subterfuge of the management
of this stinkitorium.”
Dr. Jones carries a smile that won’t
come off, but this brings you nothing
and it is impossible to get an inter
view with him. I have tried time and
again. He only came through the
ward about once every two months—
or such a matter. George Bell said he
never knew such an institution of
black barbarism could exist in a civi
lized community and that the food
given to the patients was not fit for
hogs to eat. He put most of his time
in at the 19th Ward, where things are
better, and only stayed a short while
at the Twin-building, and does not
know how to appreciate the full ex
tent of the horrors as I do.
I do not allude to Dr. R. C. Swint’s
not punishing these attendants be-
Glje Jeffersonian
cause I have anything against him,
for I have not. I think a great deal
of Dr. Swint and learned to love him
very dearly, but I do this in the hope
of making him investigate these
charges.
A big fellow named Chockley was
sent to Q hall as attendant while I
was on that hall. He was dead broke
and ragged and did not have even a
chew of tobacco. He asked me for a
chew and I did not have any as I do
not chew tobacco, but I begged a chew
from some of the other patients sev
eral times and after he had been there
for several weeks he rewarded me by
threatening to throw my mail out of
the window because I asked him not
to throw my papers and letters down
on the floor, but to hold them until I
got my hands on them. He is now
“choking” over on Convalescent on
20 Ward with Tom Hollis, heretofore
mentioned. This Tom Hollis would
not even allow me to drop a small
piece of cheese which I had bought
with my own money into a bag of
eggs in the State safe and keep it
there from supper to breakfast. There
is no use to ask them for any favors
whatever, as they do not grant any.
You cannot get many patients to tell
anything against them because they
are afraid to do so.
Tom Ray is another noted choker.
Three attendants were carried into a
wire guard room one day when he
came up and choked me severely.
He is on P Ward, Twin building. I
mention some of the worst chokers
here because they are the most brutal
ones) but they all will choke and beat
patients and will continue to do so
until a system different from the pres
ent one is adopted. The doctors will
sometimes pass a wire guard room for
a week and never look in. M. A.
Poole, hereinbefore mentioned as hav
ing had his nose broken one night by
Alex. Hawkins and a crowd of other
attendants, said the wire guard room
was a pool of blood and before day
light they came in and cleaned up the
floor and put him in another room,
but the doctors would not open the
doors to look in. They call these wire
guard rooms sealed rooms and will not
open the doors to investigate. Dr.
R. C. Swint is more inclined to investi
gate these things than the rest of the
doctors and has more feeling for the
patient, and he is a gentleman, the
only trouble being that he allows the
attendants to mistreat the patients.
These doctors get a good salary, the
assistants get about $l5O a month, and
L. M. Jones gets about $250 per
month. They only spend about, two
hours each day, at the most, in going
through the wards. If you do not go
to the chapel on Sunday to preaching,
you may not have the pleasure of see
ing this L. M. Jones more than once
in three or four months. He knows
how to smile on the ladies and visit
ors and smiles on the patients, too,
but this smile does no goojJ. I showed
him my broken finger and told him
he should not keep men that would
break up patients in this manner, but
he made no remark whatever.
It is like the Hon. Thos. E. Watson
said about Morgan when his man
killing railroad was killing men by
the dozen. He did not care or try to
prevent same. They were not his wife
and children, so why should he care?
Same with L. M. Jones.
Friends, fellow-citizens, he has no
feeling for the poor unfortunate crazy

Weak
Heart Action
There are certain nerves
that control the action
of the heart. When they
become weak, the heart
action is impaired. Short
breath, pain around heart,
choking sensation, palpi
tation, fluttering, feeble
or rapid pulse, and other
distressing symptoms fol
low. Dr. Miles lieart Cure
is a medicine especially
adapted to the needs of
these nerves and the mus
cular structure of the
heart itself. It is a
strengthening tonic that
brings speedy relief.
Try it.
“For years I suffered with what I
thought was stomach trouble, when
the doctors told me I had heart
trouble. I had tried many remedies,
when the Dr. Miles’ almanac came
Into my hands, and I concluded to
try Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure. I have
taken three bottles, and now I am
not suffering at all. I am cured and
this medicine did it. I write this in
the hope that it will attract the at
tention of others who suffer as I did.”

Cure, and we authorize him to return
price of first bottle (only) if it fails
to benefit you.
