Old-Age Annuity System is a
Success in Canada
Washington, Sept. 28.—The Can
adian government has solved the
problem of “comfort and happiness’’
in old age for every citizen wild will
comply with the simple provisions
of the annuities act of 1908. For
years philanthropists and statesmen
of the United States have sought in
vain to solve the problem of old-age
pensions or annuities for our civil
employees. The Canadian authori
ties have taken hold of the matter
with a firm hand and clear head and
found a happy solution. But it is
not confined to civil employees of the
government. The Canadian states
men could not figure out wherein a
civil employee had any more right to
such protection than the average cit
izen outside of the government serv
ice. So the annuities act makes
every man or woman, boy or girl
eligible.
This law has been, in force for sev
en months. In tha{ time the sale of
annuities has totaled $205,000 and
the indications are that by the end
of the first year the total will be
$500,000. The government stands
behind this fund with an absolute
guarantee. While still in its infan
cy, the system is working successful
ly. It has every appearance of be
coming very popular. Instead of in
culcating improvidence, the annui
ties act puts a premium on thrift,
the beneficiary, at a specified
age, receiving in the form of an an
nuity, paid in quarterly installments,
the income from his savings depos
ited periodically over a given term of
years or in a lump sum. In the lat
ter event, he may begin reaping the
benefits within three months.
Every cent deposited toward an an
nuity goes into the fund of the bene
ficiary, the government paying all ex
penses of management and under
taking every responsibility. The plan
is very simple and practicable, hav
ing been worked out by Sir Richard
Cartwright, minister of trade and
commerce, a recognized financial au
thority. The administration of the
fund comes under Cartwright’s de
partment, but is managed directly by
the superintendent of government
annuities, at present S. T. Bastedo.
The superintendent has issued a
pamphlet explaining in detail the
workings of the annuities system.
Copies of the pamphlet are available
at every postoffice. The law passed
the Senate and House of Commons
without a dissenting voice, showing
how thoroughly satisfied Canadian
statesmen are as to its wisdom. Con
sul Frederick M. Ryder, of Rimouski,
has transmitted a copy of the pamph
let to the state department. It
makes very interesting reading.
Canada has had a postoffice sav
ings bank system for some time. It
may be that the new plan whereby
annuities are provided is the logical
outgrowth of that government-guar
anteed institution. The annuity can
not be seized for debt of any kind;
can not be forfeited, and is inaliena
ble. The beneficiary can not be de
prived of it in any manner, by any
person or by any process of law at
any time. A person may contract
Jeffersonian
for an annuity at the age of five or
at any subsequent age, but, except
for invalidity or disablement, no an
nuity is payable before the age of
fifty-five.
No matter how little or how much
is paid in, the benefits will be rela
tively the same. The beneficiary can
not lose in any event. If he should
die before the annuity becomes due,
every cent he has paid in, with com
pound interest at the rate of 3 per
cent, added, will be paid to his heirs.
There are no lapses. If contribu
tions are interrupted by sickness, loss
of employment or other cause, pay
ment may be resumed at any time.
If payments are not continued to the
end of contract, such proportion as is
paid in will be used to purchase an
annuity for the beneficiary.
Employers of labor may, under the
law, contract for annuities for their
employees. Societies or associations
of persons, being bodies corporate for
fraternal, benevolent, religious or
other lawful purposes, mly contract
for annuities for members.
“The following illustrations will
demonstrate to you the vastly great
er advantages of an annuity contract
over any kind of investment as a
means of making provision for old
age.
“A man beginning at 20 years of
age, and paying 25 cents a week until
he is 60, may provide an annuity (or
income) for the remainder of his life
of $129.91.
< “A man beginning at 25, and pay
ing 25 cents a week until he is 60,
will receive $99.34.
“A man beginning at 35 years, and
paying 25 cents a week until he is 60,
will receive $54.90.
“A man beginning at 20 with a
cash payment of $lO, paying 25 cents
a week, and adding $lO every five
years until he is 60, will receive an
annuity of $151.96 at 60.
“If a man has a few hundred dol
lars for which he has no need, he
could not make a more provident dis
position of this money than to buy
an annuity for each of his children.
For a boy of 15 a payment of SSOO
will secure him at 55, and for the re
mainder of his life, an annuity of
$220.60; or at 60, of $323.50. And
the same amount at the same age
would secure a girl (whose expecta
tion of life is greater) an annuity at
55 of $202.95; or at 60 of $289.05.”
A table is given showing the re
sults of the system where the age of
the beneficiary upon first payment is
twenty and the age of annuity sixty.
This is not arbitrary, since the bene
ficiary can govern the age at which
the annuity shall begin after he shall
have reached fifty-five. According to
this table, a SIOO annuity at sixty
years of age will cost exactly three
cents a day from the age of twenty.
This is a total of slOl.Ol a year,
which draws compound interest at
the rate of 4 per cent., and aggre
gates a total deposit of S4OO. With
the compound interest this invest
ment really equals $2,000. This
amount, in turn, is invested at 5 per
cent, and the annuity paid from the
income.
In order to secure an income of
S2OO at sixty, the beneficiary must
pay in only five and one-half cents a
day or $20.02 a year. A S3OO annual
income may be secured by the pay
ment of $30.03 a year, or eight and
one-quarter cents a day. The maxi
mum annuity of S6OO a year can be
secured by the payment of sixteen and
one-half cents a day, or $60.06 per
annum. This represents a five per
cent, return on an outlay of $2,-
402.40, with compound interest at
four per cent., aggregating $12,000.

National Daily.
FRESH FLOWERS.
A writer in Southern Orchards and
Homes asks: How many people neg
lect to water their shade-trees and
flower-beds? The editor of this de
partment knows a Texas man who is
still gathering fresh roses from his
bushes, when all his neighbors, in
fact, most of the residents of his
town, can only point to their with
ered, parched bushes and trees. This
man, on the hottest day of the year,
had his home-grown flowers on the
table, and they were almost as fresh
as flowers would look in early sum
mer. He simply waters his trees and
flowers; waters them right, and they
return him, for his service, beauty of
bloom.
your responsibility.
Don’t look to society as a mass to
remedy the wrongs that are rooted
in your own door yard. Start in
yourself and help weed.
Stand ready ever and always to
give yourself—not money, not food,
not cast-off clothing, though these
have their values, too—but yourself
to the uttermost farthing.
Feel yourself alone in the world
with the man in want. You’ll help
him.
Feel yourself alone in the world
with the woman in despair. You’ll
comfort her.
Feel yourself alone in the world
with the shivering, half-clad child.
You’ll feed and warm and love it.
Let each of us take up and shoul
der our individual resposibility!

n? ROBABLY
There is not a reader of The Jeffer
sonian who is suffering from a Kid
ney, Bladder or Uric Acid Ailment
but what would like to get away
from costly, heartbreaking failure,
the grinding misery of it all and find
a remedy which when fixed and
ready to take would cost no large
sum, be entirely harmless, would
not taste very bad and withal per
fectly dependable in most cases.
So, Mr. Publisher, I will ask you
to tell every such reader (man or
woman) that if they will at once
send their full and plain address to
me I will without charge of any na
ture be glad to direct them to the
remedy I so successfully used in my
own case and right in my own home.
Respectfully,
MR. A. S. HITCHCOCK,
