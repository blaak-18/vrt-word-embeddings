f: space given to this matter by t:he to
N; ew Orleans dailies would seemi to set
infer that a failure to heal the ou
breach between the faculty and mni
class would result in a total dis- nip
memberment of the whole State. an
Thomas Jefferson wrote: "'The T1
lo-e of order arid obedience to the ccr
laws, which so remarkably charac- the
terize the citizens of the Ui;::,: an
States, are sure pledges i tir:ital to
tranquillity, and the e-.ctive fran- wil
chise, if guarded as the ark of our tini
safety, will peaceably dissipate all Sir
combinations to subvert a constitu- is -
tion dictated by the wisdom and clai
resting on the will of the people." all
The Gazette is pleased to note less
that the State paper;, have, with less
few exceptions, abstained from sto]
saying anything about the next
gubernatorial campaign. This is (
as it should be. Political d: s- dilh
sions at the present time wald em1
prove very injurious to the business sue
of the whole State. Let's wait mal
a while; the people have h-td too a
much politics and they need a rest. quit

SOARD.
I DA Y No public school system can be
eficient unless capable and earnest
'RaTOK. teachers are employed. In order to
QI-H. effect this as nearly as possible a
State board of examiners should be
second appointed whose duty it would be
to pass upon the examination papers
of all applicants for positions in the
" public schools, for and determine
i for the advisability of issuing certifi
r in cates to teach upon due consideta
tion of morality and teaching ability.
Such a board, being removed from
local influence and personal con
siderations, would most likely be
0,000 impartial. Htowever, in creating
such a board-, it should not be dele- c
cold gated any privilege to interfere I
aijust with the local management of c
vould schools. It should be left strictly
with the local board to choose from l
-ctcr a amncg a number of teachers hold
i ur ' iug c:Li~icactes whichsoever they
for choe, leaving them to determine li
iwhich will suit them; the object of c
theithe board being purely anti simply I
the to decide as to a teacher's fitness to i
'h teach.
1o7- B  _D ISSUE.
Possibiy some of the readers of
rat- Te G.azc'te may not understand
eat- Iwhy te government has found it- a
ism. self under the necessity of issuing ci
able bonds to purchase gold, and for that L
reason the following explanation is
offcered.
was A.t present the country is T.rac- an
at ticaly on a gold basis. The gov- d
elton erment owes over a billion of dol
lars, the interest upon which an
iant amounts to an enormous sum and gr
the. is paya le in gold. All dues, im
ttle posts, and excises by which the gov- as:
i22 ernment derives revenue are pay- vil
on- able in any legal tender issued. ha
The bankers, in order to produce a qu
tfinuancial crisis and send gold to a Ac
; rc:nium, hoard the geld and ay thi
nail alutic and excises in paper. ';e t
Snt governmiaenc thus fI:r!ds itsef forced hu

Mir. T. J. Thayer, of Crowley,
has been antmusing himself writing
some gross absurdlities for the col
umns of the Southern States Maga- rAI
zinc. Wlhether this new literateiur
is ignorant of the facts or is wil- ls:.r
fully misrepresenting them we can
not say, but it is manifestly true
that hle is the author of the most Parish
foolish and ridiculous stories that successi
we have read for a long time. Per- successi
haps Mr. Thayer is over-zealous in I S"e ,t
his desire to induce his Northera AilAI
friends to come and join hirm in trator h
his Southern home, but by all Nt .
mneans he should confine hIimself to all parti
the truth and not attempt to steal curt, ,h
from the late Baron Munchausen of thisi
his well merited reputation. If that Give
be his purpose he should go at it in in he ti
the regular style, and not miix his
S jokes .with a ti'ae cts to give them
the appearance of truth. Says Mr.
n be Thayer:
Irzest "Until within the last ten years
Ler to this parish (Aca'ia) and much of

the descendants of the old Aca

mine lived without contact with the out
,rtifi- side world, with no title to the land
and with no desire to have any
seta- title, regarding the land as free as
ilty. air or water. Stock roamed where
from it pleased and it was considered a
con- greater crime to injure a horse or
be "beef," as all horned cattle were
called, than to take human life.
Lting Anyone who wished plowed a piece j
lele- of land, put in a bit of rice or sweet n
Mere potatoes, and when that soil was p
