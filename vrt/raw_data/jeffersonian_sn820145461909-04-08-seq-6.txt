ZETTERJ FHOW THE PEOPLE
HAS NEVER SURRENDERED.
Marble Falls, Texas, March 1, 1909.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Inclosed find names for Weekly
Jeffersonian.
Well, Bro. Tom, call that confer
ence, invite Debs, Gompers and
Mitchell, and all the reform forces,
and if we can not unite them there is
no use to fight plutocracy with ballots,
it will take bullets.
Some of these subscribers are
Bryan Democrats. I told them that
after they had read your paper three
months and were not satisfied and had
not gotten the worth of their money,
to let me know and I would give their
money back and have you to transfer
the paper to some other fool Demo
crat.
I think in a short time I can send
you more subscribers. I am now
past 75 years old, fought in Confed
erate army, belonged to the sth Ten
nessee cavalry, and never surren
dered. After the war I went to Geor
gia. I love the old State and its good
people, and Tom Watson best of all.
Your friend,
A. J. Kinser.
ANSWER TO LABOR AND LIQUOR
Through the courtesy of the editor
I hope to be able to pay my respects
to an article which appeared in the
Baptist Advance (Little Rock) enti
tled “Liquor and Labor.”
Sam Jones said, “If you cast a
stone in the midst of a pack of hounds
and one of them yelps, you may know
that you have struck him,” but Sam
very cunningly withheld the informa
tion that oftentimes the hound is un
justly struck. I have been struck by
the article referred to and am pre
pared to howl. The article is based
upon an alleged incident of recent
occurrence in Chicago and I surmise
that it was an egregious exaggeration
of facts, for I am loath to believe that
people, who were as poor as they evi
dently were, could have so much money
to spend for anything, much less for
lager beer. However that may be, my
effort is in behalf of labor, which I
believe to be incorrectly represented
by the author of the article. Labor
and liquor are not as inseparable as
labor and idleness. Permit me to say
in behalf of labor that it constructed
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the
Pyramids of Egypt, the Colossus of
Rhodes, every city, town and village
of the universe, every railroad, loco
motive, every garment, every house
hold utensil, farming implement, tele
phone, telegraph, graphophone, in fact
every thing with which civilized
man has been blessed in all the
ages. In fact there was never any
thing made under heaven but what
labor made it.
Furthermore, my observation in
life leads me to conclude that the bil
liard room, pool room, dance hall, sa
loons, gambling dens, and all imagin
able devices are patronized by the
idle rich in the ratio of ten to one
more than by labor. For the laborer
is too tired, mentally and physically,
and has not the time, money nor the
inclination to seek such recreation,
but he is more inclined to seek repose
and recreation in sleep, “Tired na
ture’s sweet restorer,”
The article is based on one inci
dent. Would it be just to judge
Christianity by one sample, and that
one the poorest you can find ? No!
Judge it by such men as John the
Baptist, Paul, Martin Luther, Spur
geon, Talmage and John A. Broadus.
Judge law by S. J. Tilden, Alexan
der Stephens and George G. Vest;
poetry by Homer, Virgil and Byron.
I without hesitation affirm that
“true manhood” can be found only
in the ranks of labor, for when you
go out of her ranks in your search
there is nowhere to look but in the
ranks of idleness, and God never put
such a stamp in any such ranks, and
He never will.
From labor’s ranks come our best
thinkers, our best statesmen, our best
historians, our best teachers and our
best preachers.
I ask in all candor why it is that
our modern pulpit and religious press
are so prone to criticise the faults and
extravagances of the laborer and are
as mum as an oyster about the ex
travagances of the rich?
One masquerade ball in one of our
large cities would swallow up the
yearly salaries of a score of laborers,
one wine and champagne supper
would do the same. The trip of our
navy around the world at an expense
of some twenty million dollars to
gratify the whim of Root and Roose
velt, a banquet to Taft at New Or
leans cost something like $40,000.
They should open their eyes and begin
to talk and write about something
that is likely to wreck the Republic—
extravagance and class legislation.
Jno, P. Austin.
FROM THE ESTEEMED EDITOR
OF AMERICAN WHIP.
Lancaster, Pa., March 28, 1909.
Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: I am delighted with
your article in April number of the
Jeffersonian Magazine, “Another
Word on Foreign Missions.”
I hope you will have it printed in
pamphlet form. If the wide-awake
element of our population know what
is good for them and their country
they can do nothing that will be more
effective than circulating that article.
It is, in my opinion, the most power
ful blow that has yet been struck
against the Jesuitical schemes of the
papal hierarchy, as well as against the
deluded Protestantism which practi
cally aids the purposes of that hier
archy. You turned that discussion
into this channel with remarkable skill
and incomparable ability.. It is the
work of a profound student of events
and wise statesman and patriot.
Yours sincerely,
Ezra J. Weaver.
A FAIR QUESTION AS TO AMERI
CAN SHIPPING.
Fort Ethan Allen, Vt.,
March 27, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: Although in address
ing you as I do on the subject of the
U. S. 'Statutes, I can not help feeling
like a one dollar Ingersoll attempting
to correct the transit at Greenwich in
the matter of the correct noon, never
theless I must ask if there are not a
“Jeffersonian
few other legal requirements in addi
tion to the building of the ship in
the United 'States, in order that it be
sailed under an American flag. I have
always understood that legislation had
been obtained touching the details of
marine administration, such as sailors’
pay, fare, etc., which render naviga
tion under an American register mote
expensive than under a foreign regis
ter. It is possible that these minor
burdens may be practically negligible
in comparison with that of the build
ing of the ship under a protective
tariff, but is it not a fact that they
exist?
Yours truly,
Wm. F. Flynn.
Answer: It is true that our laws
require that an American vessel be
manned by a certain proportion of
American sailors, but is stated in the
debates in Congress that this require
ment is easily and constantly evaded.
In money, the American sailor
seems to get a higher wage but on
account of the high prices of the
necessaries of life caused by our
damnable tariff system, the European
sailor can buy more with his lower
wage than the American sailor can
buy with his higher wage.
A GAME LAW THAT WOULD BE
WORTH WHILE.
Warm Springs, Ga., March 10, 1909.
Dear Sir: After much study, the
gentlemen who last autumn appealed
to the Georgia sportsmen to consider
the necessity for more effective laws
for the protection of game, have pre
pared the enclosed as a suitable Game
Law for Georgia. We ask you to ex
amine it, as a measure for improving
present conditions, and write us your
judgment on it. Also, if you agree
with us, undertake to work up favor
able sentiment for this bill, especially
among the farmers, "who will be more
benefited by it than any other class
and at less cost, the $3 licenses will
practically all be paid for by town
men and the sls by non-residents.
We take the position, that in order
to have more game hereafter, less of
it must be killed for awhile. There
fore some of the shooting must be
stopped. This will be done: First,
by prohibiting the sale of game, mar
ket and pot hunters will be stopped.
Second, by requiring payment of a
license, those unwilling to pay for the
privilege will be stopped and the
funds arising from sale of licenses
will enable the Game Commissioner to
enforce this law. Third, by requiring
written permission to hunt on the
lands of others, ninety per cent or
more of the negroes and idle whites
will be stopped, and taking away this
temptation to quit work will help the
farmers to have their work go on more
regularly; and the land owners can
then decide who may hunt on their
lands; and the game wardens will
undertake the unpleasant duty of
prosecuting those who violate any
part of this law. Fourth, by shorten
ing the open season, cutting out the
month of November when many of
the quail are too young to fly fast or
far; in this month heretofore more
quail have been killed than in any
other of the open season; this will
also be better for the farmers as it
will postpone the driving and riding
through the fields until the crops are
mostly gathered; and the farmers
will also then have more time to join
in the sport.
We recognize that in order to se
cure the desired results, there must
be a willingness among sportsmen to
give and take in the construction of
this law and they must sacrifice some
former privileges, which now amount
to nothing because of the lack of
game, in order that some of the shoot
ing be stopped, which is necessary to
insure an increase of game birds and
animals.
We wish to have a meeting, in May,
of as many of the Georgia sportsmen
as will join us in the organization of
a State Sportsman’s Association, the
general purpose of which will be to
secure the passage of this bill and un
der its provisions, promote the protec
tion of game.
Respectfully,
Chas. T. Hopkins,
Chas. M. Woolfolk,
Chas. L. Davis, Secretary.
BOLTED REPUBLICAN PARTY ON
ACCOUNT OF NATIONAL
BANKING LAWS.
Hines, Ala., Route 2.
Mr. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Enclosed P. O. order for
$1.60, for which please continue to
send both Jeffersonians to J. M. Al
len, Hines, Ala., Route 2. I am an
old Federal soldier, immigrated here
eleven years ago. Was born in Clark
County, Ohio, September 9, 1331.
Polled my first vote for Mr. Pierce.
Have voted every presidential election
voted for old “Abe,” and am proud
of it. Bolted the Republican party
for inaugurating the infernal national
banking system. Was hardened in the
bolting by succeeding acts of Con
gress, such as the refunding bill, the
burning of the greenbacks, the en
franchisement of the negro, and the
establishment of tyrannical carpet
bag government in the South. A list
of crimes the blackest hell will ever
know if man stays on the earth a
million years yet. Yours in the cause
of true democracy,
< J. M. Allen.
LET US PRACTICE WHAT WE
PREACH.
Cohutta, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: I am so glad
you broke the ice on the Foreign Mis
sion question. I have been thinking
for the longest time that it was the
most holy farce that was being played
among the pious. Fearful and tear
ful are the tales that are told in
mournful tones about the heathen,
mostly by those that devoutly pray
for help Old Nick to rout, —but vote
the while to help Nick out.
One poor Parson whose head was
shaped a little curious, urged his al
most pauper congregation to chip in
for the heathen. If they couldn’t do
more than put in a “penny,” he said,
a penny might save a heathen. Now,
I submit that, if that logic be true,
the thing to do is to sell out and send
all the pennies resulting from the
sale at once, for numbers of them will
