The Colored People and the
White Radical.
There is a.very signiclcmt and in
strnctive lesson to be fcand in the
discords and feuds now breaking out
among the Republicans everywhere
within' the State. The recent faction
riots in St. James and Plaquemins
are only straws. The great wind has
blown thenm to us as evidences of its
power and direction.
Plainly the crisis we have all fore.
seen and anticipated is approaching,
if not actually at hand, The igno
rance and credulity and prejudice by
imeans of which a mere handful of
white :adventurers have arrayed the
colored people in blind and bitter hoe
ti!ity to us, moderates under the in.
fluences of time and experience Com
mon misfortune, the stern arguments
of poverty, lack of employment, gaunt
aid visible depression, threatening
rain-these have touched, the negro
as no words or protestations ever did ;
taught hint the folly of the course he
is pursuing: warned him of the cet
tasn result thereof. Perhaps the pro
.ess of the awakening was quickened
more than we suspect by the 14th of
September. It must have been a se- 1
rious appeal to thee colored people's
better, sense to find, after so many
years of fear and suspicion, that
the whites, flushed with victory and
unrestrained in their power for good
or evil, manifested not the slightest
enmity- towards, them ; developed
none of those murderous and revenge
fol instincts which they have been
taught to believe were latent an only
awaiting an opportudity for display.
One canuot well doubt that the con.
viction growing out of -this testimony
did much to vitalise the discontent
felt by the colored people with their
pretended friends and self-imposed
raleisi 'They had taken up these
men because they were persuaded it
was necessary in order to preserve
themselves and perpetuate the pri
leges accruing from the war; yet
here; by one supreme flash of. truth
and enlightepnment, they found they
had beenfalsely persuaded, and that
the danger they were guarding against
sopaiunally had no exigence cave ini

' From the Shreveport Times we extract
the following Which contains sound
sense. Let our people read it to the
negroes and ask them the question,| if
this thing will pay them in the long
run. Now that troops are here and
wholesale arrests have been made, is
there not a rebound in all this which
will hurt some one and that seriously:
The stake we are playing for is the
redemption of Louisiana. If we lose,
we lose everything. The triumph of
the radicals in November insures the
permanency of the Kellogg usurpa
tion ; it means, too, the persecution
of the taxpayers of the State with re.
hewed energy, and the ultimate Afri
canization: of Louisianaspr the anaili
'lation of the negro power through
blood. We paint no fancy picture;
the history of Martinique, of San Do
mingo and Jamaica illustrates the
truth of what we say; if we are heat
en in this election, the whites will
have either to abaidon the State or
resort to arms, aye to a fierce war
upon the negroes to protect them
selves and their property, The North
ern fools who are urging on this issue
by encouraging the organization of
the negroes against the whites, know
nothing of the native brutality of the
negro, nor of the desperate straights
to which the whites are driven, nor
of the terrible crisis they are urging
on-a crisis which troops cannot con
trol-because. troop cannot control
desperate men who are resolved to
venture their lives to redress their
wrongs.
There are two-other classes who do
not seem to comprehend these things
-a small class of white men who re
fuse to register and aid their people
in carrying the election and avoiding
this crisis, and the negroes who are
again rallying to the support of the
thieves they have put in power and
thus invoking upon theirlheads a ter- I
rible and bloody rettibution.
A IRISHMAN's Larnm'-Here is an
Irish gentleman's letter to his son in
college.: .
My Dear 8en--I write o6: send you
two, pair of my old breeches, that you I
may 'have a new coat made out of I
them. Also some new socks, ihich
yourmother hasjust knit by cuatting
down, some of mine. Your mother 1
sends you ten dollars without msy
knowledge; and for fear you may
notuse it wisely, I have kept back l
half and only send you five. Your
mother and I are well, except that
your sister has got the measles, which
we think would spread among the
other girls if Tom had not had it be "
fore, and, he is the only one left. II
hope you will do honor to my teach-t
ings; if not, you are, an ass, and 1
your mother and myself your affec.
tionate parents.
KRa IuT To YoYasaLr.-YoU have

your husband is unkind, you wife

..BIBLICAL COMPARItlONS.-The ma.
[ nia for biblical comparisons, says the
Cincinnati Commercial, seems to Jave
broken out to au nnusual extent
since the recent publication of the
Republican Congressional address,
which was full of them. On Wednes
day last the Tribune said that Beech
er "preached in the most famous pul.
pit the world has ever seen since Pati
preached on the Hill of Mars." On
Friday it said chloroform was the
"greatest boon to suffering humanity
since the stars shown over Bethle
hem." Now, why not carry out this
sort of, thing all through I Lydia
Thompson is the most remarkable
dancer since the daughter of Herodias
danced before Herod, and Was re
warded with the helad of the Baptist.
The horse lster, surpasses any spe
cimen of its kind since the Apocalyp
tic horse. The wine at last night's
feast was the best that has been serv
ed since the marriage in Cana of
Galilee.. .The. falsehoods expressed
by Parton are the .moet, appalling
,known since the days of Ananias and
Sapphira. The recent hurricane re
minds as of the tempestuous wind
called Euroclydon, mentiuoned in the
Acts of the Apostles. The mourning
over the lost child in Philadelphia re
sembles the lamentation heard in
Ramah over the lost children. The
removal of Collector Casey would be
a more wonderful thing than has ta
ken place 'in that line since the remo
val of Levi, the son of Alpheus, sit
ting at the receipt of customs. But
those. who are so fond of Scriptural
comparisons should see that there is
some sort of 'sense in such as they
make.
Ax INxAMoUS CHAaGS.--A special
dispatch to the Chicago Times, dated
Kankakee, Ill., Oct. 8th, contains the
following :
Kankakee, Ill., Oct, 8.--The Inde
pendent Reform Mass-meetiug to-day
was largely attended by. the farmers
from all over the country.
. ' ...
After dinner, W. A.' MeKeighan, of
Pontiac, made. one of his .character=
tstic, speeches, forcible, tratbful; and
convncluing. In the course of his re"
marks lhe Rterred to the carpet-.,b
administration in Louisiaina, And asp'ke
of Willian Pitt Kellogg, not 6nl as
a usurper of t(hat power, butso ablack
leg and a thief, stating that he went
to school ta Kellogg, who at one .time
borrowed MeKeighan's father's watch
and forgot to return it.
Thisis simply awful, and demands
an immediate answer from Kellogg.
We have believed a great deal about
the usurper, and after his tremendous
crime overthrowing; the legitimate
State Government, we ought,,perhaps,
not to be surprised, at aanything that
he may have done, or may do ; but
stealing a watch is a trifle lows' than
we thought the man lad ever fallen.
Mr. Kellogg should: hold Mr. Keighan
to a strict accountability for the in
famous charge.--~ 0. B Ehslses "

CHEAP VINEGAR.-Take a quantity
of common Irish potatoes, wash them
until they are thoroughly clean, place
them in a large vessel, and "boil them
until done. Drain off carefully the
water that they were cooked in,
straining it, if necessary, in order to
remove every particle of the potato.
Then pqt this potato water in ajug
or keg, which set near the store, or
in some place where it will be kept
warm, and add one pound of sugar
to about two and one-half gallons of
the water, some hop yeast, or a small
portion of whiskey. Let it stand
three or four weeks, and you will
have excellent vinegar at a cost of
six or seven cents per gallon.-4our.
hal of Chemistry.
TAKE TIME FOR MALS.--A very
bad, and probably the most injurious
habit the American people have-es
pecially mechanic--ia that of rapid
eating. We should eat slowly, and
give our victuals more time to digest,
and we would find it much better for
our health. Germans do not rise so
hastily from the table as we; for time
with them is not so precious; life is
not so crowded; time can be found
for after-dinner talk. The cigars and
coffee, which appear before the cloth
is temoved, keep the company to
gether; rind in that state of snffused
comfort which quiet digestion creates,
they hea without anger the opin.
ions of antagonists.
To Dr Pr uxs.-Gather the plums
when no too ripe. Prick each one
with a drning-needle in several pla
ces. Taie half a pound of sugar to
each pound of' fruit. Melt the sugar
with a little water; skim it thorough
ly ; then add the plums, and boil for
half an hour. Lift out the plums, and
boil the sugar -for twenty minutes
longer, or until it nearly candies,
which you can tell by taking up a
small quantity in a spoon and letting
it drop down until It threads out in
strings. Turn it over the plums, and
put them to dry tin a cool oven, stir
ring them up every few minutes.
When candied, put them into boxes.

stand an hour or an hour and a half,
keeping it covered at Bfrst,not to coel

grate nutmeg over it, iand cover it
