Grateful Thonsands proclaim
V inegar B itters the most wonder
ful Invigorant that ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person can fake these Bit
ters according to directions,-and re-'
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by .mineral
poison or other means, and vitifl or
gans wasted bevoud repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States/
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, .Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Kio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our" entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons* of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably oc- .
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their,
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon theso vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to D r . J. W alker's V inegar
Bittkrs , as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the saino time .
stimulating the sécrétions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs. . .
Fortify tlie body agaiiist dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
Vinegar Bittkks. No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus fore armed.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, Head- 0
ache, Fain in the Shoulders, Coughs,
Tightness of the Chest, Dizziness, -Souro
Eructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste
in the.Mouth, Bilious Attacks, Palpita
tion of the Heart, Inflammation of the
Lungs, Pain in the region of the Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are the offsprings of Dyspepsia. One bot
tle will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scrofula, or King's Evil, White
Swellings, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled
Keck, Goitre, Scrofulous Inflammations,
Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as m all'other
constitutional Diseases, Walker's Vin
egar B itters have sjiown their great cur
ative powers iu the most obstinate and
ifitractable cases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and 4? ladder,
these Bitters-have 110 equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases.— Persona
engaged in Paints and Minerals,'such as
Flijinbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub
ject to paralysis of the Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of Walker's
V inegar B ittkrs occasionally.
For Skiu Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter, Salt-liheum, Blotches, Spots, Pim
ples, Pustiiles, Boils, Carbuncles,•King
worms, Scald-hcad, Sore Eyes, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scurfs,' Discolorations of the
•Sfcin, Humors, aud Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
• Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed, and re-"
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelmintics will free the
system from worms like theso Bitters. c
For Female Complaints, in young
or old, married, or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, or the turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so"decided an.influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Rlood
whenever you find its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores ; cleanse it wh'eu'yoU find it ob
stuueted and sluggish in;the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul ; your feelings will tell
you when. Keçp the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
