WOMEN OF KUKLUXKLAN
WILL SUPPORT KLANSMEN
PROTESTANT WOMEN AWAKENING
By A KLANSWOMAN.
The announeement by the Imperial
Kloncilium of the intention of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to spon
sor and recognize the organization
known as the Women of the Ku Klux
Klan, an amalgamation of the var
ious Protestant women's associations
already organized in the different
states, has given the needed impetus
which will hasten the growth and
seal the unity of this movement.
Patriotic American women, organ
ized under different titles in differ
ent localities, but all working to
ward the end, have welcomed
this action on the part of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, as it means
the consolidation of the various units
and a combining of the efforts being
put forth by these women.
This action has, of course, oc
easi on e d widespread discussion
among members as to the probable
future relationship between the two
organizations, both from a material
and idealistic standpoint. It is im
probable that there will ever be at
any time in the future a consolida
tion of the two forces into one or
ganization, as it believed that great
er efficiency may be achieved and
work accomplished through the main
tenance of two separate and distinct
organizations, each supporting and
•o-operating in the activities and en
deavors of the other it is inevitable
and highly desirable that they work
ia closet harmony. Having the same
ideals, holding the same principles,
pressing consistently toward tha
same goal, their aims and purposes
are inseparable.
Can Accomplish Much.,
There is no righteous thing that
may not be accomplished by the
combined efforts of these tow mighty
organizations, already bound to
gether by the strongest ties, in bonds
not forged by the mind of man to
bind the mind of man, but created
by God to bring his people into closer
union with Himself. Who is it
doubts that the Declaration of Inde
pendence and the Constitution of
these United States were God in
spired? Who is it doubts that God
Himself will ■ prosper and cherish a
people who accept Christ as their ex
ample, the cross and the living fire as
their symbols? Human nature is
not immutable, it is only the Divine
nature which is “the same yesterday,
today and forever.” Shall we not
expect then that man, awakened, en
lightened, educated, inspired, shall
approach daily, hourly, through right
endeavor that perfect state wherein
he shall reflect the mind which was
also in Christ Jesus?
There is no reason to agitate the
question of the physical relationship
of the men’s and women’s organiza
tions. There is no division of in
terests—even though two separate
organizations are maintained there
will be no deviation from the prin
ciples which both groups hold in
common. They make no secret of
their aims and purposes, the highest
and holiest that ever actuated a vast
body of people. From henceforth in
this country the malign, secret and
deadly influences which have worked
consistently, steadily, to Undermine
the foundations of our government
will be met and overcome by active,
unified, secret, vital influences for
good. These influences will establish
and preserve forever, to our children
LYNCHING DECREASES
AS THE KLAN GROWS
FALSB STATEMENTS SMASHED
BY FACTS
On* of the principal arguments of
the enemies of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan is that the Klan is the
eause of innumerable lynchings of
negroes. Tuskegee Negro Institute
every six months issues statistics on
the lynching situation in the United
States, which of themselves refute
this claim of the Klan’s enemies who
would brand this great order as a
lawless institution.
Tuskegee figures for the first six
months of 1923 show fifteen lynch
ings, thirteen of the victims being
black and two white. During the first
eix months of 1922 there were thirty
lynchings. During the first six
months of 1921 there were thirty-six
lynchings.
Admittedly the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan has experienced its great
est growth during the past two and
a half years. The figures of the ne
gro statisticians therefore show that
as the Klan gained in strength so has
lynching gradually diminished. The
Klan stands for law enforcement
through properly constituted officers
and seeks to eliminate the causes of
mob violence. Apparently it is being
successful along these lines.
♦While on the subject of lynching,
it would be interesting if the Tus
kegee statisticians would compile fig
ures en the number of negroes eom
fltittng offenses against white women
whe are arrested by officers of the
and our children’s children, the glor
ious privileges of free men.
Can Protect Rights.
The union of these two organisa
tions, the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan and the women of the Ku Klux
Klan, will not only accelerate the
establishment of the brotherhood of
man, and the equality of the sexes,
in this generation, but will produce
in the coming generation, not super
men and superwomen, but individuals
fully cognizant of their rights and
privileges and citizens of the great
est republic of the earth,, who will be
fully equipped, fully armed, to pro
tect those inalienable rights from the
invasion of hostile forces.
Christian men and women of today,
those who have aligned themselves
with this great movement, will in
their separate spheres work consist
ently, earnestly, prayerfully for unity
of thought and action. Neither dis
couragement, opposition of the press,
nor enemy propaganda, however dis
guised, shall be permitted to obscure
the vision of that ideal toward which
strive.
Is it too glorious a thing to expect
that in the near future we shall have
public schools, freed from the eccle
siastical influences which would stifle
real education and progress? Is it
too glorious a thing to believe that
we shall in time have municipal,
state and national government freed
from the deadly clutches of un-Amer
ican and alien forces, a national gov
ernment “deriving its just powers
from the consent of the governed?”
Is it impossible or the “dream of an
idealists to declare that the laws
upon our statute books will be en
forced, that American citizens may
live in peace and harmony, enjoy
ing in greater measure than ever be
fore the sacked privileges designed
to be their lot by the founders of
this country? The Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan and the women who
will stand beside them in the battle
to achieve these ends, answer, in a
mighty chorus which reverberates
from the Golden Gate to the Atlantic
coast, and from the portals of the
northland to the southern shores—
“ No.” It shall be done.
Faithful Flinch Not.
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
have long since demonstrated what
may be accomplished by the concert
ed t unified efforts of a vast body of
men working together in harmony
of puropse, and the women of the Ku
Klux Klan, although their organiza
tion is still young, have much to their
credit. .In the coming months, there
will be trials and conflicts, there will
be foes and traitors within and with
out the organizations, but the faith
ful will not flinch. There is no
doubt, no uncertainty as‘to the out
come. History records the rise and
fall of many states and empires, but
there will never be recorded in any
history the rise and fall of the
American republic.
The growth, the advancement, the
achievements, the glory of this, our
nation, have been but the gradual,
logical, inevitable result of the eter
nal righteousness of the principles
upon which she is founded. This re
public has risen, never to fall, it is
the visible culmination of the highest
hopes and aspirations of the human
race. God is the author of our lib
erty.
law, brought to trial and convicted
annually. Compare this data with
the lynching list and the comparison
would prove astonishing.
RACE RIOT IN ILLINOIS
NEGROES TAKE WHITE
WIVES FROM HUSBANDS
Worth', 111. —White women were
snatched from their husbands and es
corts by negroes, armed with razors
and revolvers at a dance here recent
ly.
One negro is dead and four persons
are seriously injured as a result of
the attack of 150 negro laborers on
a dance pavilion here.
White men were held at the points
of guns and threatened with razors,
while burly coons snatched their
wives and sweethearts from their
arms.
Local police were driven off by
the mob an<T reinforcements were
brought in from neighboring towns.
The negroes were finally driven to
the laborer camp near here and forc
ed to baffricade themselves behind
box cars and labor apparatus. Many
of the desperadoes escaped *on a
freight train. Others surrendered to
the officers.
Construction officials employing
the negroes moved the box car camp
fearing an attack from the enraged
citizens. The city settled down when
it was learned that the mobben had
been moved from the city.

IN DEFENCE Of K.K. CM ASK
LET THE SCOFFERS READ TO LEARN
AND SCOFF NO MORE.
America is a leand of tantalizing
beauties and entrancing mysteries.
Proudly buttressed between the west
ern seas, the imparadised domain of
a happy breed of men and classic in
stitutions, a world within a world;
withal, separate and apart. And of
all its entrancing mysteries, I hold,
its Invisible Empire, the nights of
the Ku Klux Klan, the most mys
terious and strange. Its genius is pe
culiarly American; beautiful, diffi
cult, paradoxical; a charming puzzle,
restless as the eternal seas, but stead
fast as the promise of God to man.
Elusive as the spirit of the rainbow
treasure; distant, too, and cold as
some dead planet twirling in the cos
mic drift as if lost in the infinitude
of space; with all burning bright, yet
nearer than my shadow made by the
descending sun down the western
slope. Ancient and honorable, old in
principle of youth. A laughing spirit,
weeping in her laughter. Apparently
as fickle as the atumnal zephyrs, but
as true to you as the stars are in
the skies. As placid as the calm that
follows the war of the elements; as
quiet as the silent dominions of the
dead; as noisy betimes as the shock
of contending armies; as clear as day
but impenetrable as the empyrean
night. A beautiful heart revealed for
all to see, woo and conquer as they
may—and yet a fortressed heart mys
tically enshrined, as impregnable as
the rock of Gibraltor that will not
yield! A giant of Atlantean propor
tions; yet a beauteous maid, a mere
wisp of a girl, even a Joan of Arc,
whose destiny is God’s raising the
siege impressed by the cohorts of
evil. Hercules cleansing the Augean
stables of national filth, rebuking the
roaring cataracts of crime, silencing
the hissing geysers of shame. An
angel of mercy drying the widow’s
tears scarce begun—not leaving that
beautiful mission to time and physi
cal exhaustion.
Terrible, beautiful, spiritual, ma
terial; darkness, light; solitude, fra
ternity; storm, silence; ominously is
suing from the shadows, betimes
boldly tramping in the glare of the
meridian noon. Who shall reconcile
this paradox? Who shall solve the
riddle of the Who shall un
lock the secrets of this great deep?
None! She feels not the shock, of
their pontact; enemies, baffled and
bruised, retire astonished at the bold
ness of their designs.
The Elan’s Glory
Verily, its greatness rests in its dif
ficulty, is due to its impenetrability;
its impenetrability to its mask. By
the mask you will see the Elan’s
glory, but ye sh'all know it notl
Christ the Messiah, masked in hu
man ' form, made sentiment the
glory of God, but men knew it not.
Behind that mask there moved the
God unseen, unknown. Forsooth!
Only a God could have drunk from
the cup of Gethsemane and waded
thru the inferno of Calvary to the
throne triumphant! From the secret
domains of the malignant eye leering
at them askance. Well, they know
their existence is not an apology; it
is a vivid life heraldic of a nation’s
redemption. Behind that mask rowls
the fire that clothes their nanie in
letters of flame. They ride on the
chariot of the sun.
Upon this land they look with a ful
some stare of buring curiosity, note
ing here timid truth and audacious
lies, ignoble virtues and splendid
transgressions, crimson crime and
scarlet sin, pitiless tyranny and un
grateful rebillion, fratercidal wars
and decimating destruction, eternal
need and battering greed, labor stalk
ing with cormorant, capital with the
commune, and with all, a nation fair
to see. The august loneliness of its
path lends dignity to the Klan’s pil
grimmage. It drives on impelled and
guided by the courage of a high en
deavor.
Why? Whither? Whence? Its
days race after one another, brilliant
and quick, like the flashes of the bea
con light. Round her habitation
abysses of fraternally space meet in
an impassable frontier. A great soli
tude moves with her, ever the same
and always imposing. Now and then
unattached satellites wandering in the
reflected glory of borrowed light, bur
dened with an initative unselfishness,
bounding catycliptic to a bottomless
oblivion. Yes, klansmen ride on the
chariot of the sun. But a land is un
faithful to its prophets and reform
ers; a truth, a faith, a generation of
men goes and is forgotten, and it does
not matter, perhaps, except for the
few who believe in the truth and the
law, confessed the f*aith of their God,
loved their country and their fellow
men. x
Not an Aggregation of Individuals
The Klan is an institution woven
in the warp and woof of this republic
indelibly as the Constitution, the bill
of rights, and the writ of habaes cor
pus. It is an institution not an ag
geogation of individuals; an institu
tion militant, with discipline pitiless,
whose strength can be quickly mo
bilised, whose power can be given a
Napoleonic concentration. 'Wise and
lamina** le the reason for their mask.
Sanctified In history by lie martyrs,
symbolical of faultless honor and pe-
TRR CALL OF THE NORTH
triotism militant, gloried in song and
story, rejuvenated into greater glory
by contemporaneous events, it has
come to stay. It is pot that sinister
mask worn by lewd hirelings to en
hance their climb into the church, and
which establishes society’s selfish so
cial distinctions. It is that knightly
visor which graces well any imperial
son of this classic republic.
It is that glorious raiment that
gives the perspective which leads into
invisibility—an invisibility as potent,
justifiable and glorious as that of God
and the hosts of Heaven.
When these robed riders of the
Apocalypse, foretold /by the lonely
seer on the isle of Patmos, solemnly
move to bring about reform, the mask
destroys the frailties of individuali
ties and the grandeur of the institu
tion is revealed. Its power is felt.
The militant character of the or
ganization is brought to bear, accom
plishing certain, positive and definite
results.i
The mask lends invisibility; invisi
bility gives that distance that lends
enchantment, the enchantmen of
srength. To negate, the mask would
bring an unworthy, if not insidious
proximity.
The Mask is the Bulwark of Secrecy
111-related proximity develops a dis
proportionate perspective, with all its
consequent train of evils. It is but
a step from intimacy to contempt;
but an instant from contempt' to
hatred. Stony and bramblous are the
paths of hatred. The mask is the bul
wark of secrecy, is the Alpha and
Omega of strength. The abolition of
the mask would be the emasculation
of the klan. It would bring about the
total paralysis of the greatest pa
triotic organization of all times. ,In
its wonderful secrecy and the abso
lute inability of the enemy to ascer
tain the idenity of its membership
reposes the impregnability of the in
visible empire. It is a dictum of piti
less logic that in secrecy and beneath
that mask lies the power of the fa
mous order in its fight against the
powers of hell. In the day that it dis
cards the mask and secrecy inviolate,
that day the - Empire Invisible dies.
May God prevent the catyclism.
Men work wonderfully well in se
cret. Give a man surrounded by ma
lignant enemies a robe*and a mask
and conceal his name and ident’ty,
and from that moment he is a man,
super-powerful in his God-given her
itage, strongly fortified in his fight
for ideals, and enemies know 'not
where to place their hands upon him.
When dealing with one’s enemies they
must be attacked in their own style,
and in the same impenetrable dark
ness by which they are surrounded.
Another method spells defeat. In
God’s own time klansmen shall un
veil their faces. That time shall be
when victory will have been won.
Then will the true patriots of Amer
ica give you befitting honors and ac
claim you as the salvagers of this re
public*! evils, which a benign destiny
has ardained you should be. But that
day is afar in the offing; until then
cherish that robe, retain undoffed the
mask! Secrecy burgeons and main
tains strength. Success is contingent
on secrecy. Great institutions are al
ways by nature secretive. The great
war moved, Jived and achieved its
success on the silent and hidden by
paths of glory. Jealously guarded
were its dread secrets, until eternal
victory gave forth their sweets.
Great institutions are truly secure un
til their secrets are known; then only,
do the worms of decay hasten V> the
banquet. To be great one must be
secret; and to be great is to be mis
understood; to be misunderstood is to
be felt for but not known.
Not Wise to Pry Into Secrets
It is not wise to pry into secrets to
satisfy a lustful curiosity. And it is
the acme of honesty not to reveal one.
Death is the punishment for shame
ful garrulity. It is a thing most
heinous to reveal the secrets of gods
or men, the secrets of friends. “De
bate thy cause with thy neighbor him
self; and discover not a secret to an
other, lest he that heareth it put thee
to shame, and thine infamy turn not
away.” Prov. 25: 9-19. “Thou shall
hide them in the secret of thy pres
ence from the pride of man: Thou
shall keep them secretly in a pavilion
from the strife of tongues. Psalm
31:20. Of traitors, “Far better had
that man not been born,” said Christ.
Judas Iscariots and Benedict Arnolds
received the just execration of both
foe and ally, the scorn and contempt
of all. They are excluded from all
friendship. The Frys and Armstrongs
of the klan drew the traditional re
ward of traitors—the thirty pieces of
silver and the universal contempt of
man. Their efforts proved abortive.
The klan is too deeply enshrined in
the central heart of America Ip suf
fer appreciably from the treacherous
attack of these social submarines.
There is nothing more despicable in
the eyes of true Americans than trai
tors, spies, eavesdroppers, stool
pigeons and keyhole detectives. These
loathsome vermin are justly regarded
as the most depraved Characters in
crookdom.

BIG SCALE LYING
UTH CRUSHED TO EARTH
WILL RISE AGAIN
(Methodist Board Clip Sheet)
The Morning Sun of Long Beach,
California, recently carried a Wash
ington dispatch reading in part as
follows:
Washingeon, June 14.—T h e
capital has become during Shrin
er’s week, the wettest place in
the United States. Har liquor
may be obtained here in almost
any amount and no visitor of the
reported crowd need go thirsty
for long if he wants liquor and
has the price to buy it.
In the shadow of the Capitol
building within a stone’s throw
of the White House, near the
treasury department and not far
from where Commissioner
Haynes holds forth, all kinds of
liquor, good, bad and indifferent
may be bought.
Now this dispatch is not only 4 con
trary to the truth, but is so absolutely
false as' to be ludicrous. The fact is
that probably Shrine week in Wash
ington was the driest week any com
munity has ever seen. To tyegin with,
the Shriners are a rather high class
bunch of men, all Masons and good
citizens. .
But in addition to this, the federal
and city authorities of Washington,
having the hearty support of local
newspapers and organizations, clamp
ed down the lid so tightly that very
little liquor was able to. seep into
Washington. As a result there were
only two arrests for drunkenness on
the biggest day of the convention and
the quota of drunks at the police
court, which even in normal prohibi
tion days is not half what it was be
fore prohibition, was cut in two. A
special court was organized to deal
with Shriners who plight be arrested
on minor charges and as there were
a quarter of a million of them, more
or less, it was planned to keep the
court open day and night.
Not one Shriners was arrested dur
ing the convention, and the court had
no business.
There are legitimate ways of op
posing prohibition but a great many
neutrals are getting tired of the stuff
which is being constantly poured out
in a stream by anti-prohibition propa
gandists and by innocent newspaper
men who are victimized by them.
