S Southern Journallsm.
The rapid strides that have been c
made in Southern journalism during
the past few years are truly astonish. I
ing. It was a common saying up to
d a very late date, "if you want to get
home news, you must subscribe for a
. Western or a Northern paper," al
- though there were three or four dail
i_ es published in New Orleans that
were making their publishers rich
r through advertising. It was also a
well settled fact that no paper in the
South could live by subscription
alone. Now, however, things have
e changed. The Southern people have
become more enlightened; they have
e become a reading people. The pub. I
1e Ilshers, too, have become more en.
terprising, and we look in vain in
Northern or Western journals forany 4
k thing that our home journals do not I
w give.
We are led to these remarks by
comparing the columns of the New
Orleans Democrat of to-day with
1. those whose birth dates back from a
I- quarter to a half a century. It has
p now become, under its present able
11 management, a power in the land,
is and still keeps on improving. The
rI vigorous mind of the gentleman at
re its head, Major E. A. Burke, omits
s, no detail to make it the Southern ri-"
'r val of the New York un,,.
Another notai,lo feature of i,,urnal
j istic enterprise is the daily City Item.
II Under the arlo hIt'nagemtenIt, of its
9 experienced editor, Mark F. Bignoy,
Esq., and the co-operation and ener
: gy of a dozen of the most competent i
- printers of New Orleans, it has grown
,f from a small acorn to a sturdy oak.
l It has entered upon its fourth vol.
ume, and has a firm hold upon the
affections of the people of New Or
leans. The writer of this labored on
it it durlog the first year of its exist.
1- ence with all the energy of his na.
t ture, and no one knows better the
difficulties it had to encounter. It
i. will be always a pleasure to us to
8- note its prosperity. Both of these
' journals have done much to arouse
d. the dormant energies of other pub.
e lishers, apd we find none of them, as
e. in former times, during the summer,
A filling their columns with "dead

n Property Asswessment.
Publie attentiot in this, as well.as
In all sections of Louisana, has been
arrested in a most startling manner
o by an article whlich appeared in the
* New Orleans Democrat, 19th June, on
the subject of asesement. In the
a article referred to the Democrat sets
d forth the alarming faqt that large
Sproperty owners were deliberately I
returning their property to the State
atone-tenth, or less, of its market
* value.
~ Now comes the Ibervlie BSouth and
in an equally outspoken manner
o "shows up"' the rich planters and
land owners of that parish who are
Sshabmelessly doing the same thing,.
while the poor man is giving his in
i for taxation at its full value. On this
it artilee from the South the Demo.
crat says:

them for their services. As if the
e State had any source of revenue save
y that of taxation upon the people,
' while they have been juggled into
electing those very men with the un
derstanding they are not to pay.
We are glad to note that the great
mass of our people are sick and tired
n of this cant of repudiation and tax
resistance, and we heard one of Ra
* pides' leading citizens declare it to
0 be the duty of those who desired to
jt sustain a government of law, and or
a der under law, to combine to com
1. pel an honest assessment of property
in the State. When this feeling shall
it have fully expressed itself, as it sure
h ly will, the days of tax resisting and
a repudiating demagoguery will have
e ended.
n The Serawanhaka Disaster.
e The burning of the steamer Sea
'e wanhaka, on East River, was one of
. the most heart-rending disasters re
i. corded for many years. The Morgue
n was crowded with dead bodies, some
y of which were so badly burned as to
t be unrecognizable, and a wailing
multitude In search of missing friends.
y Many acts of heroism and self-sacri
w flee are recorded, as well as many
h acts of ghoulishness and depravity.
a The following graphic description of
a the scene the day following the dis
le aster we clip from the World of June
1, 30th:
1e The boatmen on the East River op.
posite Ward's and Randall's islands
were aatir long before daybreak yes
rs terday patrolling the river in their
i-- skiffs looking for the dead. The re
mains of the steamer were still
I smouldering on the sunken meadows
where she had been beached by her
•. brave commander the night before.
ia The fire had nearly died out, but
here and there the wood-work of the
hull, the forward part of which at
- low water was firmly settled in the
t soft mud of the meadows, was still
n burning. All the upper works of the
steamer had been burned off and
nothlngremained, but the hull, which
1- blazed away until the tide rose
e over it and put out, the fire in the
coal bunkers forward. The moon
r- had risen about midnight and ena
a bled the boatmen from the two
t. islands to patrol Little Hell Gate
and other points of the river front
and watch for floating bodies and to
1e see plainly every object on the sur
It face of the water. At daybreak aI
to dozen fresh boats put off from vart
ous points on the New York and
" Long Island shores and made the
1 best of their way to the wreck. The
b. fire was all out, but the iron work
i was still too hot to be handled. Grad
sally the number of small boats in
c ereasedto a hundred or more-boats
d of every eoneeivable design, from
y the homely flat-boat to the neatly
modelled skiff. Nearly every boat
had two occupants, and some had
more. Most of their occupants were
impelled by curiosity alone, while
some of the crafts had a decidedly
Is suspicious look, and the faces of some
a of the oarsmen would have looked
, decidedly better behind the barred
door of a prison. It was low water,
e and the bow of the Seawanhaka was I
i high and dry on the low beach of the
e sunken meadows at a point almost
Sdirectly opposite the northeasterly
extremity of Ward's Island. The
e stern lay floating in the water. The 1
y bull was burned off in an Irregular
linte about two feet from the water
at the after portion, while for.
Sward on the beach nothing but the
bottom planks were left. The keel
d sons were entirely burned off and
,r there was nothing to denote where
Sthey had been but a long spike here
andthere. A small part of the out
e water was left. Not a vestige of the
, decks remained, and the rudder-post
Swas burned off allowing the rudder
to hang loosely in its place. The I
Is boilers were still ln place, and do not I
* appear to be la any way injured.
The door of the port boiler was open.,
The door of the other was closed fast.
SThe smoke-astack still stood, but was
held in position only by the pipe of
' the whistle, which Ifmsed through
its flange. The woodwork support.
elog the walking-beam of the enginel
was burned away. and the beam it.
self was twislted out of all shape.
The piston rod, whloh was bent al
most double just at Its entrance to
the cylinder, held the beam in paloi
tion and rre eit safe for men to ig
Swork under It. The hull la covered
Swith copperand the draught of wa
ter reqilird isvery light. 4l around t
i the hull ir pleasy of the woodwork a
Swch had burned off and tumbled
hatoe the water. The port paddle
whel was sarcely charred but the
t wboardwheel was twiste& out of
aisape. On the meadows in front
Sof theow was a cllection of small
aitss m.inelunding toilet utensils,
- _caet.a and hllf-burnt clothing.
- In the wreck among the ashes two
Sidosen men and boys were sersplag
and dihnlg for valuables and any- I

And the transaction of bunine',, role
vant to the holding of the District t
Convention, agreeable to the crll of
Judge Wm. M. Levy.
The meeting was enllelI to order at
12 o'clock, when Wnm. E. R'ssell,
Esq., of Natchitoches. was called to
the Chair, and E. F. Pressley, of Ha- i
blne, appointed Secretary.rv
On a call of the roll, the following
delegates answered to their names:
H. W. Ogden, of Bossier; T. J. High
tower, of Bionville; C. C. Nash, of

J. C. Wise, Rapides, E. W. Sutherlin,
of DeSoto, and J. D. Watkinb of

ies. Winn and Vernon parishes
were without representation.
On motion of H. W. Ogden, the
temporary officers of the meeting
were declared permanent officers
thereof.
The first business in order being
the appointment of a Committee on
a Credentials, the Chair appointed the
following named gentlemen: E. F.
Pressley, Chairman, H. W. Ogden
and C. C. Nash.
The Committee, after a short re
f tirement, made the following report:
To W. E. Russell, Esq. Temporary

s pectfully refer back to the Commit
tee the claim of J. W. Banditford to

[Signed I E. F. PRESSLEY,
SChairman.
The reception of this report led to a
lively discussion between Messrs.
t Iollingsworth and Sandiford on one
t side, and Ogden and Pressley on the
B other, on the ground that Mr. Sandl
I ford being an accredited proxy from
his own parish, Red River, it was
I Impolitic to permit him to represent
Webster also, and the Committee of

On motion of the same gentleman,
it was renolved that the basis of re
presentation be fixed according to
Sthe vote polled for Gov. Wiltz at the

-each parish one vote for every two
hundred Democratic voters, anit
Sone additional for every fractional

SIt was ferbher resnlved, on motion
Sof 0. C. Nash, that the parish -of
r Grant be allowed one extra vote in
Sconsoequence of being deprived, by
informalities, of the Democratic votes

t a requllst fr its t)uiblication:
)f "25 WEST TWENTY SIXTR STREET, 1
Juune 8,1880. )
t "Mjor-G eneral Hancock:
"My DEAR GENERAL: I take the
earliest opportunity to congratulate
0 you Ulboti your nomination, and to nae
i- sure you, life-long Whig and Repub
lican thaet I am, of my most hearty
support. I helong to a very numer
ous and very s:aunch ,l(I silver-gray
Republican tft!eily. With one soli
t- tary exceptiton, here tnever was one
Sof thea known to Vote the tL Demo
cratic ticket.. but I venture to say T
they will to a man:t vt\'e for you.
- They cannot counsisently do other
!- wise.
r' You, sir, embody the views and A
sentiments in regard to the great
' questions of the daiy that we have en- E
)f tertalned since the war closed. They
c. are the same that actuated General E
8 Orant when he laid down those lib
eral terms of surrender to General I
Lee. They are the sameo that actua
e ted my poor friend itayimonud, when
g he battled so manfuily in the com
mittee ofCongress against the savage
policy of Thad. Stevens. I believe
Gen. Grant would support you to
day, did not the exigencies of his sit
n uation forbid it. And Henry J. Ray
1e mood, were he alive, would support l
Syou too, unless the exigencies of the
New York Times restrained him. He
fn was compelled at an early day to
smother the sentiments he had ex
e. pressed in the address of the Phila
. delphia Convention, to abandon his
career in legislative halls and to
ry change the tone of the Times, or, as
al Mr. Jones, our business manager and
partner, insisted, the paper would be
ruined. (I believe I offered to pay
. the dam ges at the time, but that
, was considered impracticable.) It A
t was a bitter 1pill, but it had to be
swallowed. Thad Stevens had sue
t. ceeded through a Congress which
!o misrepresented the country in en
, grafting his policy upon the Republi
p' can party. And though a majority
t of the party, as I firmly believe, were
Ps disgusted, it was fastened upon them
re and there was no way of getting rid 8
e of it. Thus for years a vast number a
. of us, good Republicans, have been 8
t- compelled to be helpless supporters u
to Af a policy we believe to be the very
r. worst that could be devised. An op- g
portunlty is presented us now for the
first time with any show of success to
vote in accordance with our convic
a tions, and I am sure we shall do it
*. most joyfully. With great respect
e and esteem, believe me yours faith
te fully, LEONARD W. JEROME.
The course of M. Gambetti, Presi
m dent of the French Chamber of De
e puties, on, the plenary amnesty bill,
at has been approved, and the Premier
)f ship will, doubtless, be forced upon
him.
