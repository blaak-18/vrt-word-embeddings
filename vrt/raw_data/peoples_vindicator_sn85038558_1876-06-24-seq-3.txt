their prpctrfy, these coloredi men who
are jolilnilng or have joined the Demo

In Wards eleven, tour', and twelve,
these threats have been made,
and in the irest, a colored man, on A
J. Alf. Irudhl mmets plantation, B1
was shot at. This in)imhldtion l

Radicals or the coneqtdte~es 'ill be 1

sire to join Democratic ClIbs or vote
the Democratic ticket, and they ,,m- L
ber a thousand in this parish, will be
p*rotected at Irlhalerer cost, and the A
kiadical who dare harmn then or their
stock, will wish he had never been L
born. L
The white Clubs of the different
Wards will afford all colored men
aimplo protection, and they intend to
do it. Let oat I)emocratic colored

and an enterprising freedman can
raise more pullets in a single night,

OWING to the constant inquiries from
V various portions of the United States
in regard to the Eucalyiltus Globulous, or 11
Australian Gum Tree, we are induced to
give a thorough description of it, enl
racing m1any facts not hitherto pub
lished. Through the courtesy of Sonn- I
tagg & Co., of this city, we have devoted te
much time to the cultivation of the tre'e,
we have obtained most of the inflorma
tiotn here furnished. The Eutcalyptus is P
extensively growlt ill California, where
probably no less than one Inilion trees i1
are plinted. In this city, in front of 4
thandsome resid.ucet , yout will find it

In Algeria ilts cultivation was unuder
taken on a largo scale. Solme 13,000 Eu
calypti were plantc ! in an extremely pesi- *
tilental and unhealtliy stction, were fever
prevailed t a glreat extl:ut every year I
)uring the first sear of their growth, at
the time when the fiver season use4l to
set ill, iot a sitIgle case of fever occurrre,
yet the trees were only nine feet high.
Silnce thell this place is reported free
front its iunwelcome visitations.
In the vicinity of Coenstantinople, aul
other fever slpt, Ihlarahlly and sickly, the
whole groTtud was dried lip by 14,000 of
these trets. In Cuba marshl diseases are
rapidly dlisappeariing upon the intredue
tion of this tree. A railway station in
the Department of 'sar was so pestilential
that the oficials could4 not remain thenre
longer than a year. Forty of these trees tA
were planted, arid tie nunhealthy condi- C
tion of tihe place wavs changed.
tTwo miles front Haywards, in this
State, the uraievor General planted two
·groves of the nucalyptaus, dOle of about
ntinety acres and the otlher saevnty are,
Sthe whole comprising alut 15,000 trees.
