LETTERS TRJJW THE PEOPLE
SUGGESTIONS ALONG NOBLE
LINES.
Macon, Ga., Nov. 3, 1908.
Dear Sir and Fellow Comrade:
The American people are beginning to
open their eyes and are rapidly be
coming a reasoning and a thinking
people, and as such they demand a
sufficient reason for every claim put
forth. Not the majority are thus
aroused, but the number is steadily
growing, in strength and quality as
well as in quality, or numbers. A
great many people are “set” in their
preconceived ideas, or prejudices, and
it is the hardest matter to show them
the error of their way. When they
apparently begin to see the light, and
have been brought to recognize to
some extent the real character of the
idol of their political worship, even
then a slight flaw or inconsistency on
the part of the enlightening agency
destroys the apparent victory thus far
won.
The people are demanding relief,
but through poor organization and
lack of co-operation between the real
reformers they are scattered abroad
and easily devoured of the wolves in
sheep’s clothing whose business it is
to stalk about and deceive the people
under the sham plea of party loyalty.
All the reformers at heart should
come together in convention, in which
the masses should have able represen
tation, for the express purpose of
drawing up a declaration of independ
ence from the bondage of political
prejudice and political corruption.
Make our appeal direct to the
hearts and consciences of the Ameri
can people and conduct our warfare
on a nobler, sublimer plane than to
soil our skirts in the mire of political
slander and pollution. Work ardent
ly, patiently, steadily, and never un
der any circumstances iesort to any
means that might ever be termed
questionable, that our record may be
clear and above impeachment.
These suggestion sare made mere
ly for what they are worth and for
your wise disposal. Through organi
zation and co-operation along these
lines might determine ultimate vic
tory for Jeffersonian democracy and
I think it wisdom’s course. When
personal abuse and infamous slander
is hurled at those who stand for pop
ular rights, we should not return evil
for evil, but rather ignore their dirty
abuse and press ever onward and
upward in the discharge of duty,
ever organizing and growing in
strength and enlightenment. If nec
essary instruct the people constantly
through the medium of public speak
ers.
In short, make the new party well
worthy of the people’s co-operation
and support, not founded on political
prejudice or personal animosity, and
then invite all true reformers of what
ever former political alignment to
participate in bringing about a better
state of affairs, yet work it so as to
exclude any ambitious big-head who
might try to wreck the party by a
repetition of former mistakes.
These suggestions are respectfully
submitted for your consideration and
disposal, Charles W. Lyens.
THE PEERLESS “SHO DO ’PEAR
LESS.”
Safety Harbor, Fla., Nov. 9, 1908.
To The Jeffersonian: Well, the
unexpected happened; that is, to the
policy Democrats, when they gathered
in their crop on the third and meas
ured it. It didn’t pan out as their
reporters predicted it would, and now
they are floundering around to find
out what caused the shortage in the
crop. It seems plain to me that the
main causes were too much hot air
and the early frost, and by the use
of bad seed, which was procured of
such seedmen as Parker, Rockefeller,
Ryan, Wetmore, Taggart, Sullivan,
the Tammany gang and Mr. Henry
Watterson, all of the conservative,
sane and sound varieties, such as the
gold standard, trust regulation, “my
policy,” etc. The soil was prepared
and laid out and the crop pitched
at Denver, Col., and the Peerless
made superintendent of the planta
tion, which was to be enclosed with
his patent bank guarantee fence.
Then the cultivator (the press) was
started, and some agents called on the
Peerless about the time the crop was
being pitched and insisted that he try
some of the ammoniated Loon brand
of fertilizer as an experiment on the
crop. Methinks that by this time he
realized that its effect made the crop
“Peerless.”
Os course I can’t help feeling a lit
tle sorry for those who did not want
to lose their vote and put their good
dollars in the hat when it passed
around and expected a place at the
pie counter. The Tampa Tribune ad
mits that there is no chance for the
Democrats to get into the clover
field now until some careless Republi
can leaves the fence down for them
to break in. Poor Mr. Bryan who tow
ered so much above all other human
beings; he “sho do ’pear less” since
his last measure was taken.
Now for the next paramount issue
and we will all shout and move on.
Respectfully,
S. J. Crow.
WITH YOU FOUR MORE YEARS.
Norwood, Ga., Nov. 14, 1908.
Dear Tom: I will write you to let
you know that I am with you four
more years and then I will be with
you again. I am one of the Pops
that was put out of the jury box for
following you seven years ago, and
just want to say that I never intend
to vote any part of a moss back tick
et any more.
Yours as ever,
J. R. Armstrong.
FIELD NOW OPEN FOR A GRAND
RALLY.
Newton, Miss., Nov., 1908.
My dear Mr. Watson: I write you
as one that have an abiding faith in
you as a man, a statesman, a patriot,
and I am willing to abide your coun
sel in everything pertaining to gov
ernmental affairs. I believe that you
are right; I believe that you will
Bljc Jeffersonian
succeed in your laudable undertaking.
For, outside of the principles that
you stand for, there is nothing worth
a damn, vulgarly speaking, for the
common people. As the Old Fraud
is now down and out, the field is now
•wide open for a grand rally for every
true patriot that believes in Jeffer
sonian Democracy. There are but
two sides in the present ism: A
government for the special privil
eged, or a government for the peo
ple. The Republicans stand for the
former, while the Populists for the
latter.
So, on with the conference, on
with the campaign of education. I
am more hopeful than ever; there is
nothing in sight for the old party
voter. Many voted it reluctantly in
this campaign, while many would not
vote at all. We had no organized
campaign in this state, and you know
that there are thousands of voters
that you can not reach in any other
way. Those that do read, read the
old parties’ papers, and I find it
quite a difficult mat# to get them
to subscribe for rehpbft* literature.
But I am in hope— .at I will have
better success frole .'how on. I will
»
continue to wo4 for I know if I
can get them Vi' read your papers
they will be c-fnverted to the cause.
Wishing you unbounded success, I
am, truly .yours,
W. D. Thompson.
WANTS TO PUBLISH A POPU-
LIST PAPER IN ST. LOUIS.
Albia, lowa, Nov. 9, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Mr. Watson: It is not
possible to know as to our vote in
lowa, as yet, but I believe we have
made some gains. I want to congrat
ulate you on your splendid campaign
work in Georgia and the good results
of the election and the good it has
done for our party. We are now in
a position to do some effective work
and I am thinking of moving my
newspaper plant to St. Louis, Mo.,
and publish a hot Populist paper for
four years at least; that is, if I can
get some financial assistance from
our brothers over the country. St.
Louis, Mo., is where we should hold
our conference, in the near future,
that you spoke of a short time ago.
Hoping you will place this matter be
fore the brothers soon and good may
come to us, I wish you success and
hope to hear from you at an early
date.
Very respectfully,
J. R. Norman.
‘‘UNDER POPULIST, OR JEFFER
SONIAN, BANNER.”
Center, Texas, Nov. 19, 1908.
Mr. Thomas E. Watson.
Dear Sir: I noticed in your paper
where you advised ns to write and
let you know what we thought about
holding a conference, and the pros
pects for the future. I think that
there should be a conference held in
the near future, by all means, and
I know there is a great prospect for
the future. There is a large per
cent of Democrats down here that
say they are hunting a new home;
that they are done with the Demo
cratic party. And now is the time
for us to open our doors and tell
them to come in. There are men
down here that were once bitterly
opposed to Mr. Watson who are now
recognizing him. And all we need is
to organize and go to work. When
we get organized we will all work
harder. And I sure do hope that we
will be? organized in the near future,
either under the Populist banner or
under the Jeffersonian banner. You
shall receive a list of subscribers be
fore long, as I have the promise of
them to your magazine.
Your friend,
Duke Sanford.
FAVORS MR. HARRIS’ SUGGES
TION.
Terza, Miss., Nov. 19, 1908
The Jeffersonian, Thomson, Ga.
To Ye Lovers of Principle, Greet
ings: Have just been reading the
Weekly, issue of Nov. 12, and catch
ing the note of encouragement and
grim determination in “Letters From
the People.” I’ll give the vote at
this place. The people take very
little interest in elections, save state
and county primaries. Out of 166
qualified voters in this precinct,
Spring Port, only about thirty voted
four years ago. Os that number, one
was for Watson; this year, sixty
voted, eighteen being for Watson.
This was my first time to vote, and
I’m proud I exercised the privilege
of voting for a Southerner and a
“white man” in sentiment as well as
color. I hope to be able to send in
a nice bunch of subscribers. Popu
lists, agents, let’s send them in, and
when soliciting subscriptions ask only
Isc and send 5c of that for organi
zation purposes. I know that’s very
little but every little helps and at
/5c you can obtain more subscribers
than at sl. I, like Francis H. Harris,
would favor changing our party name
to “Jeffersonian Democrat.”
Hoping for success before mucl)
longer, I am, sincerely yours,
F. E. Smith.
‘‘TRUTH CRUSHED TO EARTH.”
Milford, Ga., Nov. 22, 1908.
My Dear Sir:
I am always willing to do “in my
weak way ’ what I can for the cause
for which you have been battling so
faithfully for these many years. I
want to say right here that I for one
am getting tired of the so-called Dem
ocratic papers telling so many lies
about the last election. We will take
this, Baker, county for a fair sample.
If .the Watson and Williams tickets
had not been destroyed by the Demo
crats who got hold of them so that
the voters could not get them, in the
different counties, as they did in
this county, things would have
boon quite different, for I had 300
tickets sent me and I sent 50 to each
precinct by mail, as I could not go in
