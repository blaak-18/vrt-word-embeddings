ENGLAND GETS FALSE
STORY OF LILLY RIOT
Reiter's Agency Garbles Facts
and Manchester Guardian
Prints Them
It seems to be a great delight to
news services, whether American or
foreign, to malign the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan. Readers in England,
for instance, must take just what
their papers print about the Klan and
its activities. The English reader
who would inform himself truthful
ly on the organization can turn only
to his daily paper. In the United
States there are Klan publications,
like The Fiery Cross, which tell the
truth and offset the mass of lies and
fabrications spread by the wire serv
ices and newspapers.
Below, for example, is a story
about the anti-Klan riot at Lilly,
Pennsylvania, sent out by Reuter s
Agency, one of the largest European
news-gathering and disseminating
organizations. It will be noted that
the number of dead and injured are
high, and that there were not 60 men
arrested and the killing was not all
on one side.
The report follows:
A Reuter message from Lilly
(Pennsylvania) says that the
greatest indignation has been
aroused throughout the coun
try by a trageuy which occurred
last Saturday in connection with
a Ku Klux Klan celebration,
when four men were shot dead
and 11 injured, some perhaps fa
tally.
The Ku Klux Klansmen came
entirely uninvited, and held their
ceremonies in an open field.
Some of the more daring of the
townsmen are said to have played
a fire hose upon them as they re
turned in procession from the
field to their special train. In
the shooting which followed none
but townsmen were shot.
When it was learned that the
train came from Johnstown the
police of that city were notified,
and met it upon its arrival. The
Ku Klux Klan delegates were
searched, and 60 of them have
been arrested on a charge of car
rying concealed weapons.
PRAISES V. S. GOVERNMENT

the largest throngs that greeted a
speaker here in years, a state lectur

that the United States government
is the best in the world and that it is
not one-half as corrupt as some folk
weuld have us believe it is. The Klan
speaker was delivering a talk on
“Americanism.”

Ignorance Never Wins
Over Knowledge
In Calcutta. India. 800 telephones
went out of commission with one
stroke of the ax, as an ignorant coo
lie, making an excavation, mistook a
telephone cable for the root of a tree.
The telephone lines were immedi
ately repaired, of course. It took the
services of many skilled men for many
hours, patiently to sort out the wires
and match each with each. Mean
while, 800 telephone users went with
out the easy intercommunication
which the telephone affords. What
tragedies were thus caused will nev
er be known. All that is reported is
that in one instance, ignorance undid
the work of many hours, and that
many more were required to repair
the damage.
In the long run, ignorance never
wins over knowledge. But it is the
greatest weapon of ignorance that it
may strike swiftly and do much dam
age in a little time. One ignorant
law maker may stop the wheels of
progress for months; one ignorant
school teacher may retard for years
the development of the minds of fifty
pupils; one ignorant action may undo
the careful plans of philanthropy.
Had the coolie known what a tele
phone cable was he would not have
cut through it. Did the ignorant
teacher know better he would not
hurt the little minds in his charge.
Had the ignorant law maker been ed
ucated or had a wiser choice been
made at election, necessary legisla
tion would not have been blocked.
Education, knowledge, information,
power to understand, and once again,
education, are our needs! The chil
dren of today are the citizens of to
morrow. The knowledge they gain
today will be used in governing them
selves tomorrow. let us. all of us
who claim some small measure of wis
dom as our part of life’s winnings,
see to it that the most precious gift
of man to man. of father to child, of
government to citizen, be given in
full measure, pressed down and run
ning over; let us give our children
the best of schools, the best of teach
ers, the best of knowledge, that when
they, too. become men and women,
they will be among those who repair
the telephones, not those who cut
communication.

I, Tka King of Assyria Invadss
Judah (Lsa. 36).
1. Rabshakeh Meets a Deputation
From Judah (vr. 1-21). Rabshakeh
was a representative of Sennacherib,
the king of Assyria, whose mission
was to Induce Judah to surrender. In
order to accomplish this he:
(1) Tried to bully them Into sub
mission (vv. 4-9). Ha taunted them
with their weakness and told them
that Egypt was a broken reed that
would not only fall of support but
even pierce the hand that reached
out to it. He challenged them by
offering 2,000 horses. If they would
furnish riders for them. If they ceuld
not furnish this small number It
would be futile for them to attempt
to withstand the great Assyrian army.
(2) He asserted that It was use
less for them to put their trust In
God (v. 10). He even declared that the
Lord had sent him to destroy Judah.
(3) He tried to create a panic
among the people (vv. 13-21). Fear
ing a panic among the people the
deputation of the Jews urged Rab
shakeh not to speu!: In the Jews'
language. Taking up the suggestion
he spoke loudly in the Jews' language,
warning them against trusting In Heze
ktek.
(4) Re promised them plenty In an
other land similar to their own (vv.
16, 17). He urged them to make agree
ment with him and upon his return
from Egypt he would take them to a
land of plenty, but the people were
loyal to Hezeklah, for they knew that
the cruel Assyrians could not be
trusted.
2. The Deputation Reports to Heze
klah (v. 22). They rent their garments
doubtless In fear and dismay over
thalr perilous condition, for the crisis
long before predicted by Isaiah had
now come upon them.
11. Hazekiah’s Behavior (Isa. 87:
1-36).
1. Resorted to tha Houaa of tha
Lord (v. 1). This is a sure resort of
God's people In time of distrees (Ps.
73:16, 17; 77:18). This action was
prompted by faith, for God had prom
ised that those who In time of distress
resorted to His house would be heard
by Him (II Chron. 7:15, 16).
2. Sent Isaiah (vv. 2-7). The logical
and natural thing for the king to do
under such circumstances was to
send for God's prophet. The prophet
sent back words of encouragement to
Hezeklah, assuring him that God
would bring deliverance.
8. Hezekiah's Prayer (vv. 14-20).
Rabshakeh, who seems to have with
drawn from Jerusalem for a little
while, now returns from Sennacherib
with a letter warning Heseklah against
trusting God for deliverance, assuring
him that he would be deceived for no
god waa abla to stand against the As
syrian array. He spread the letter be
fore the Lord and prayed.
(1) He recognized God's throne,
making It the ground of his plep
(v. 16).
(2) He recognized the peril which
threatened the people (vv. 17-19).
Sennacherib had indeed laid waste the
HTTMERac Battens, but that min re
sulted because the gods of the nations
were not real.
(3? He asked for deliverance (▼.
20). He desired that deliverance
would come In such a way as to vindi
cate and honor the Lord.
4. Isaiah's Message to Hexekiah (vt.
21-35).
(1) That Sennacherib's sin was blas
phemy against the Holy One of Israel
(vv. 2123).
(2) That Sennacherib had forgotten
that he was an Instrument in God’s
hand (vv. 24-28).
(3) Judgment upon Sennacherib was
imminent (vv. 20-35). Deliverance
would soon come and that through the
energy of the Lord of hosts.
111. Destruction of the Assyrian
Army (vv. 36-38).
The sngel of the Lord went fortli
and amote in the camp of the As
syrians 185,000 men, so Sennscherih
was turned hack by the way he came.
He did not enter Jeruaalem and after
thla defeat he went back to Nineveh
to live and while there worshiping
in the house of his god lie was as
sassinated.

MOTION PICTURES HAVE NOT YET
ATTAINED PLACE IN EDUCATION
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON. D. C„ May 12.
That the motion picture is an educa
tional force of great, if static pow
er, is generally recognized by educa
tors. A. W. Abrams, director of vis
ual instruction in New York state
schools, says:
“Visual aids to instruction are
physical equipment. Like the appa
ratus for natural science classes, ma
terials for teaching drawing and tools
for vocational instruction, projection
apparatus and pictures of various
kinds for class instruction must be
provided by boards of education as an
essential part of school equipment,
or we shall make little progress.
“We do not have at present even a
good beginning of an adequate sup
ply of pictures that meet education
al standards for the schoolroom. In
the field of motion pictures we find
announcements of business concerns
that claim to furnish a large number
of films on all subjects. But on ex
amination these have at best only a
popular informational or entertain
ment value, not related closely to
the school course.
“In confirmation of this idea that
films are far from educational stand
ards. comes word from the Los An
geles superintendent of schools, who,
while believing in films as a means
of instruction, thinks the obtainable
educational films arc few’ in number
and poor in quality. She puts the
case before the educational world in
this way:
“The list of instructional films is
meager. The scenario maker has ev
er in thought a situation which will
catch the public fancy; the edu
cator requires a scene true to fact.
The scenario writer plays upon the
emotions; the educator tries to in
fluence the judgment, to develop dis
criminating thought and a fine ap
preciation.
“The imagination of the teacher
must interpret this material for the
child. She must see the significance

of what is shown on the screen. Af-’
ter all, even visual education fall*
short without teacher presence and
power. We must be sure that the
teachers themselves see, for how shall
the blind lead the blind?”
“It is to be noted that what “teach
er prescience and power” may inter
pret a poor film to some good end,
poor pictures, which need interpre
tation, are not as good, from the ed
ucational standpoint, as no picture#
at all. In the latter case, the teach
er of interpretative power can draw
a mental picture in the minds of her
pupils which is at least accurate, if
not beautiful.
Educators are doing much to im
prove educational motion pictures by
vigorous representations to picture
makers regarding the character and
quality of films needed for classroom
use.
