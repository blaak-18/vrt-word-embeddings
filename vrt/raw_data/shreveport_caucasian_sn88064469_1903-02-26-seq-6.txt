Kingston, Jamaica, Feb. 9.-So you
In the States are shivering with icy
winds down your spines by day and
hot water bottles to your feet nights?
Here at Kingston the thermometer
ranges between 70 and 90. For those
who dread cold it may be said that 70
degrees is uncommonly low tempera
ture in Jamaica; those whom extreme
heat makes furious may be assured
that here the register did not go above
88 during a specially noted period of
ten years.
Jamaica Is a mountainous island.
high and dry. That is the reason there
are no mosquitoes to speak of. If one
wants a bit of cooler climate for a
change, he has only to ascend some of
the multitudinous mountains of the is
land, and it will become one degree
cooler for every 300 feet he climbs.

New York, Feb. 1&.-The attention of
womankind is divided just now by the
fact that we are without doubt in for
much bitterly cold weather, making
furs and warm garments necessary,
and are in the midst of the social sea
son when handsome evening and recep
tion gowns are required. Also, we have
all the dainty glories of the summer
dress goods spread out before us in
every direction. From whence that cu
rious fashion came I would like to
know, that in the middle of winter we
must purchase and have made or make
up the dresses that are to grace the
summer. But so it is, and lovely woman
Is hastening from one place to another
seeking the dainty stuffs for warm
days.
But I think that "sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof." and so we will
talk about the comfortable suits which
are so necessary and so pretty. Be
sides, they are the right thing in the
right place. There is an unusually
nice list of spring woolens, which are
made up in many ways to suit many
people. For the young girls who look
pretty in anything there are sonic
homespun plaids. with the pattern
raised higher than the body of the ma
terial by zibeline stripes , in lighter
shades of the same color. In the illus
tration is a suit made- of brown home
spun with stripes of tan with the zibe
line hairs. The hairs are almost cream
white.
This particular suit has a plaited
blouse with a Garibaldi strap on the
shoulder. The cuffs are of tan cloth,
and so is the quaint turudown collar.
The skirt is laid in slot seams to the
knees. where it is left free. A draped
belt of brown velvet and a fall of ac
cordion plaited brown taffeta make
the finish. Very young ladies rather
like to go out without wraps, and for
them are close chamois inner vests.
Plaid woolen stuffs are offered in all
the shades of gray and brown and also
dark blue with dull, grayish white zib
eline squares. In fact, all colors seem
to be seen in the plaids, and where a
suit is made of plaid'the hat or toque
is made with the dress goods as a foun
dation. It is considered very stylish to
have the hat of the material, as that
fact is supposed to show that the suit
is not a ready to wear difair purchased -
from some cheap andpopular store.
I have a strong impression that there
will be an unusual amount of black silk
worn for suits and plain home gowns
the coming season. -and it dill*not be
the cheaper varieties. For there are
nany of toe good old kinds and quali
ties to be seen among the handsomest
of the advance costumes. I have seen
much, stror. and .solid grosgrain. ar
mure and satin duchesee, as well as all
qualities of taffeta. Next to them come
the liberties and printed Indias and

Sault Ste. Marie, Feb. 17.-When n
little girl the other day closed a switch
in the big power house recently com
pleted here, the problem of cheap pow
er for the middle northwest was solved:
The moment contact was made by the
closing of this switch eighty-one huge
dynamos began to revolve. sending a
current that will turn the wheels of in
dusty as far as Detroit. 250 miles from
here.
What is of more immediate impor
tance to the people of this city is that
the new canal and power house will re
sult in a civic development that was
Impossible In the old days. For one
reason alone, the absence of cheap
power. Sault Ste. Marie has been back
ward of growth. Coal has always been
very costly. so that, despite the natural
advantage$. despite the city's location
In a vast mining region and on the
banks of government canals, the place
has never boasted a population of more
than,20,000 people. With the advent of
cheep power all this will surely be
changed, and it is small wonder that

surrounding. and marks a new era in
our *hlsory. This event will `impress
upon the outside world our possibilities
as a manufacturing center, and Upon
our own people all that the develop
ment of water, power really means."
How tht -hange was made possible
is an interesting story in itself. The
only outlet of Lake Superior is` the St.
Mary's river. which empties into Lake
Huron. but which is unnavigable ow
ing to falls of twenty feet. To over
come this both the United States and
the Canadian,. governments,, built ship
canals several years ago, thus stimulat
ing the commerce of the great, lakes,

so badly a-"d by'Saflt Ste. Marie.
To- mak' use of this difference in
level a caaatftwo and a half, miles long
has =beep built. from Lake $lsperior to
a point in the St.,Mary's liver far be
low the falls. Just before the drop into
the river the canal spreads, the water
out into a pond,. making the fall more
than a quarter of a mile in width.
Across this extensive expanse the huge
power house has been built.
Without doubt the building; is the
longest structure In the world, being
1,368 feet in length. It is supported by
eighty-one arches, through which the
water flows. Three buudIed and twen
ty turbines traiimit -tbe power to
eighty generators. easi. of 500 horse
power. Each of the huge dlynamos thus,
affected Is a wonder in itself, for-on ac
count of the peculiar way in which
they are run there must not be the
slightest difference in the wiring, and
the revolutions of all the - machines
must be identical.
One peculiar outcome of the building
of the canal has beep the construction
of 'shat are known as compensating
works. Before the great power scheme
had been compl ed lake men realized
the great doss the lake would sustain in
having 30,000 cubic feet of water' with
drawn every second. It was asserted.'
and not without reason, that within a
few years Superior would not-be fit for
navigation. Complaint was made to
the war department, and the protest of
the lake men was upheld, the engineers
being ordered to devise some tfoans of
compensation for this great drain.
For some time the problem was a
baffling one, but It was finally found
that the solution lay in damming the
St. Maryls river, which was a flow and
fall of water useless in Itself. A huge
dam was constructed just above the
rapids andtslutee gates, each fifty-four
feet long and thirteen feet high and
made of steel plates, which were so ar
ranged that they could. at will diminish
the low of water In the river. The re
suit was all that could be deslte.
Already the "Soo" is beginning to feel
the effects of cheap power.' A railroad

New York, Feb. 16. - To be yogag,
charming in person and successful in
-letters-what more is needed to arouse
public interest? Having speculated as
to the amounts which popular young
authoresses earn by their pen work, the
next questions which the average per
son asks are: "What do they do with
it? How do they spend it?" Miss John
ston, you know. is building a magnili
cent home in Richmond. IHallie Er
minie Rives has been traveling abroad.
Now comes news of Miss Bertha Run
kle, whose first book. "The Helmet of
Navarre," has brought her a snmall for
tune.
Miss Runkle Is spending the winter
in California, but early in the spring
she glans to go to Japan for a long rest.
She is not writing at present, although
she has well under way another histor
ical romance of an earlier period than
"The Helmet ofeNavarre."
"I got to a pyint where my story
seemed dead; I was just writing words.
words. words!" said Miss Runkle re
cently, "and so I put it away and will
not take it up again until I am quite
rested."
The truth Is that Miss Runkle is not
even yet over her surprise at the im
mediate success of her story. She has
a naive modesty about her accomplish
ment and is not quite positive about
the way in which she came into her
own.
The actual preparation Miss Runkle
had for her career must be of interest
to those who have theories as to the
best kind of education for a girl, and
particularly for those who show a de
cided bent. She never attended college.
Her instruction was in a private school
in New York, and when within some
two years of finishing the course. which
was practically such a one as is given
in a high school, Miss Runkle's health
gave way and she was taken out. After
a rest, instruction at home in English
and history and almost anything but
mathematics followed. This gave the
very best opportunities for reading.
"I was always browsing in the libra
ries, and did exactly the kind of work
that pleased me," said Miss Runkle.
Miss Runkle is tall, above the aver
age. She is a most interesting type of
American girl, and her manners are of
the cheerful sort, cordial, with just an
attractive shyness. She is rosy cheeked
and bright eyed.
Miss Runkle has but twenty years
and a few more to her credit. and
should be able to do valuable work in
American fiction, for she does not seem
"spoiled by excessive praise," as some
-of her friendly critics feared that she
might be. She has at least been wise
enough not, to rush another book on
the public on the strength of her sue
cess.
