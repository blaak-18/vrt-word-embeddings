For some weeks past the ()zwasian

; e Swamp A iigel Company. We had

whi,le we had satisfied ourselves that it
a,,s a good medicine, we had no true
jl'a of its real value. From direct
evadece we can affirm to any one in
trerted that this medicine i possibly
a bat has long been looked fer. We
,hould be slow to make this assertion
but for the fact that some strong testi
monials have come under our noies.
and we here present them. The orig

miliarly called, lived to bury two
wives, and, wishing not to slight
either, on his dying Isld lie asked
that his remains be buried by the
side of his faithful old dog that had
but a tew dlays Mr'ceeed him. The
request was gran:lllted.
The death of "Uncle Blob" re
calls an incident in his liti that is
decidedly out of the ordinary.
)nuring the opening scenes of
the late civil war, "Uncle Bob"
was anxious to join the Confeder

to his so doing, and used every ef
fort and argument within her pow
er to preveint it. One cold winter
morning, after "Uncle Ikb" hadl
abandoned the idea, as Mrs. Winit
supposed, of joining the iarmy, she
asked Un:cle Bob" to go to their
woodyard and gather some wosod
with which to re-kindle the fire.
Uncle Bob started, but instead
of gathering wood hle walked to
Mississippi and joined the army,
and for tour long years fought for
the cause of the Confederacy. At
the close of the war lie returned to
the home he had so suddenly desert
ed. Entering by the way of the
woodyard, lie gathered up an arm
ful of wood, and entering the room,
he found his faithful wife, who had
remained at the old home. Walk

and looking into the face of his
now dumbfounded wife coolly re
marked "Ilere's your wood", after
which lie proceeded to make him

Beasts That Get Seasick.
Lions Become Unkinglike, Mon
keys Ape Ilumanity, and
Dogs Are Woeful.
Human beings are not the only
ones who suffer from seasickness
by any means. One bears a good
deal about the pangs that have
filled men and women with woe,
but little is said of the menage
ries brought to America every
year, or carried. hither and you in
wavetossed boats.
Lions and tigers may be majes
tic when they have unwavering
earth or rock against their pews,
but a seasick cat of these tribes is
as forlon as any man ever was and
doesn't look a bit more kingly than
a wet rabbit. Even its roars and
growls have a weeping sound in
them, quite in keeping with the
general appearance of the beast.
A monkey is as pitiful an object
when it is seasick as any other
beast so stricken, and its forlorn
facial expression is so human like
and the way it clasps its paws
across its stomach is so natural that
the man who is not seasick neces
sarlly sees something to laugh at
in the misery of the creature. Not
so with the seasick man. If he
sees a seasick monkey be is sure
to swear furiously, thinking the
poor thing is mocking him.
It takes a dog to be woeful at
sea. It has a way of doubling all
up, with its tail between its legs
and bead hanging down that shows
deep seated pain. To free itself
the dog oes through all sorts of
cotortion. It will stretch out on
the deck, groan and squeal, some
Stimes rising on its haunches and
lifting its head, howl long and mis
esMl, as some dogs do at the
sound of music.-New York Snan,
I strikes me that the procession

tuse is a trife late, this summer,
but I haven't the slightest doubt
- that be will eventually arrive.
Witboat him there can be no fun.
Bereft of him, the gayety of ns
tions would be ecliLe. He is the
Hamlet, without whom the play is
litelme.
Let the negro Democrat rouse
himself.
Let bhim shake the dewdrops off
his mnee and tal, and lift his reso
ant roar. Tbejangle is lonely with
out him. Let hin put himself In
evidem , so that the processioa
may start. We jst can't think of
moving a peg until the negro Deam

himselrf together and make known
his wants. His grievances.
And his roy hopes. Let him
