Our friend Emile St. Ann Pru

a sample of wool which surpasses
any thing in texture and length of
staple we have ever seen. The
staple is fourteen inches in length,
while the texture is as fine as
silk, almost. Mr. Prudhomme in.
forme us that he is endeavoring
to introduce the bearer of this
wool into our parish, and we sin.
cerely hope he will succeed,
Our esteemed friend and fellow
townsman Col. Wm. M. Levy, has
placed us under renewed obliga
tions for a large number of Public
Doemnents, containing valuable
and useful information, which
have been stored on the shelves of
the VmINPsDCAT Library and
they add greatly to its worth.
The many friends of our esteemed
former fellow citizen MU. J. Cunning
ham, Esq., will be pleased to learn of
his intended iit-to this section. Mr.
Cmmeinglham wilt be. with, as to-day
and will remain during court term.
Vindicate Law. No Apologies.
It seems that Louisiana and
Mississippi are supposed to be in lea
leading strings to the Haes ad(l- fo
ministration. In fact, the Lleav- "n
ens portend a renewal of the ti
"',bloody shirt era" in all its hide
onsness. inl
There are causes certainly for a
good many of these flying stories, g,.
andl a prominent one to us is, the at
foolish attempt to walk in the St
South so as to satisfy snuch cattle III
as Blaine, Morton, and Butler. L(
God forbid that we should sane- in
tion or advise murder or assassin
ation, but we insist there shall be "'
a proper spirit manifested in the
suppression of crime. al
As it now stands it seems at t
we are actuated uby a desire to 01
Ipropitiate the howling fanatics of to
the New England school in our ti
endeavors to suppress crime, to
while we should do so simply to Pc
vindicate the majesty of the law. bi
We suppose no man of intelligence il
in the State will admit the posi- t
hility of ever satisfying the mor
lhid hate of Blaine's "stalwart Re
publicans," save that we should f,
crawl in the dust at their feet, and
that we will never do. o
The Chisholm riot in Mlississip fi
pi, and the Laws killing in this ti
State, have exercised to a great i
extent two classes of people. The II
Blaine crowd are overjoyed at an t
opportunity to continue the war, I
Swhile the puling pukes in the
South are tearing their hair in
the vain endeavor to apologise for t
the work of assassins or murder
ers, over whom they had no con
'* trol. r
We do not propose to apologise t
to any body for these crimes ; that t
is no way to show our sorrow for
the acts; besides we are quite cer
y tain it is no business of Mr. Hayes
or Mr. Blaine to demand an ex
r- planation, or insist upon the pun
Id ishment of the criminals. Thrust
th ing their opinions or wishes upon
1 us is rather cheeky, to say the
_ least of it.
Let Louisiana's Governor sustain
the diguity of his people and vin
dicate the law, for the laws sake.
' Should Mr. Evarts communicate
on the subject as it is threatened,
let such communications be treat
ed with contemptuous silence.
Let us be manly and just, and in
all our acts let us never attempt
to boot-lick such blatant demo.
The Laws killing will not be re
peated if Laws' sort stay away
Sfrom those parishes where they
'S have made themselves public ene
r. mies; where they lIve destroyed
labor; demoralized the negro and
outraged every principle of law
and decency, by their rulfianly
conduct in the past.
Remove the cause, and effect
need not be apprehended. Let the
Laws class emmigrato to other
/ climes, and "assassinations" will
'cease; let themn return to the
haunts of their fbrmer orgies, and
Mr. Blaine will have "food for
Sbloody retlection" tor some time
to come.
New Orleans has defeated the
Railroad tax and thereby set her
t self back fifty years. We under
11 stand that every one admits the
6. railroad would greatly enhance
be the value of property, increase
i- trade and add to the material
'* prosperity of not only the citizens
e- Iof New Orleans, but of the entire
section contiguous to the line of
route of this railroad; but that to
vote for the tax would have "vio
lated a political principle" cher
ished so long and revered so great
ly--the plrinciple, "that the can
aille had no right to vote to tax
the property of the owner."
S It is greatly to be regretted that
2.- these dear lovers of principle ()
e and sticklers for its strict observ
Sance, did not refrain fromexerting
Sthemselves for the influence and
ie voteof this same canaille against
, the road, and for the defeat of the
Stax. We like principle and its
o1bservance, but cannot for the
glife of us reconcile the "princi
Spie" of electioneering with a mob
Sto defeat a tax we so persistantly
announce that mob has no right
.to levy. Consistancy would have
come with good grace from these
. higli-toned sticklers at principle,
c but their action in defeating the
e railroad tis, smacks of "gaping
h at a gnat and swallowing.a ca'mel."

A City of Rings.
It is no wonder to us that New Or
leans has lost all, or nearly all, its thi
former commercial grandeur. The tie
number, character and extent of the lot
rings and monopolies which have It
head and being in that unfortunate be
city, will strike with wonder the re:
intelligent tender. dlo
Radicalism has left a wreck of on
grinding monopolies behind that are an
a shame and a disgrace to the whole
State. The Sugar Shed, Slaughter gr
House, Levee Company and State is
Lottery, are a few of the most prom vil
inent of these legislative swindles. the
It may ho a matter of surprise to to
many to know that a great number the
of the leading city capitalists are firm pa
friends of these rings, and think they ra
are "'good things" ; which they are- tul
for the ring men. The opposition to fla
these huge swindles, and the desire If
to repeal the legislation whereby tir
they were brought to life, is confined no
to labo ing classes and the country
people while but few persons in br
business circles seem to realize the im
monstrosity of the colossal frauds. au
They are as Tripoletan cruisers to so
the commerce of the city, and they at
prey with equal rapacity upon the lo
farmer of Louisiana and the manu- tli
facturer of the East and West. It
The port charge and license system is
of New Orleans is another inheritance pi
from a pernicious government, da
s ting back to the colonial rule of Lou- si
t isianaunder the Spanish, when Rio- t(
e ley, the governor general, instituted 7
them as a means to kill the growth p
and commerce of the youthful crlony, a
It seems the fate of Louisiana and the a
e ai of Louisiana's statemen to retain
of old laws and customs every thing s
' that is pernicious or ruinous. ti
N' New Orleans and Louisiana will ti
never amount to moch as long as these p
relics of past grinding rule ate re- c
e tained, and we have but little hope of t
ttheir repeal when we:note that a mon- o
hr er of the commission, appointed to
devise a mode of relief from the bur- g
dens layed upon us by these bad laws, a
cooly informs the committee that he a
is not prepaired to repeal the license
or port charges until other means of l
rt- centr to the city and State are sug- r
I gested. In other words, unless an
e other mode of grinding the people I
is suggested, this reformer at least I
,n will refuse to let up on the turning of c
a- the old crank.
It is sad indeed to acknowledge the t
existence of such idiotcy in our re
I form statemen, as the argument cited r
above demonstrates, and we become 2
sick at heart in attempting to con
template what we are to suffer as a
i State and a people until, not only
tthe grinding monopolies are stamped
0 out, but the driveling idiots who
- kers are bulldozed into that obscurity
.nature has so eminently fitted them
for,
Let no good man be deceived by
the specious a'gunment of the trick- i
ster and the demogogue tlhat, in or- I
dcr to carry out Nicholls' policy,
h onds must be furnished to all the
1 characterless and incompetent rascals
elected to office by the Radicals in
Sthe last contest. Such an argument 1
e is a lie and a slander on the face of
or it. No man has a right-pure and
I simple to an office ; that is, the office
does not beloeg to him; an office is a
gift of the people to he bestowed up
on worthy and competent men. The I
selection of certain men during the
past elections have been, and are mis
fortunes and crimese. To attempt to
argue that any policy demanded, that
those who were, in many instances
r- unfotunately for virtue and decency,
r. elected in 1876 should be installed in
e office by the action and support of
e those who opposed their call in the
se first instance, is as insulting to the
Sdignity of Governor Nicholls as it is
shameful, disgusting and untruthful.
There are men who have used this
slanderous argument, and that
too for a purpose, which is the
to bIuilding up of a new party at the
- expence of Gevernor Nicholls and
r. his party in certain neighboring scc
t- tions. We beg all good men to be
ware of the snares laid by these wi
ley tricketers, who would thus de
fame a cause to which they loudly
proclaim loyalty.

Stay Away. 01
We desire to know whether Af not
the people of Louisiana are under
the surveilliance of Mr. IItayes and a
lot of howling irreconcilables Northl '
It seems as if we were, if we are to 28
believe that the New Orleans Times
really wants Governor Nicholls to
(don a policenian's uniform and skip
out to arrest every mnan who kills Br
another in Louisiana.
If these killings of notorious ne
gro scoundrels is to be stopped there
is a way to do it. This class have pe
vilified and outragfnd the whites of ed
the country parishes for years, and
to suppose that some persons whom
they have ruined or hounded for the
past eight years will not take pri- Br
rate revenge is to argue against na
ture. Let these negro political ruf
fians keep out of the countryl parishes. 1
If they persist in coming back to con
tinue their orgie tlhey can expect
I nothing else than to be killed.
Assassination is a terrible thing,
ibut the New Orleans Times must ad
mit that there are hundreds of white
and black men in this State who have
º suffered grevious wrong and outrage
t at the hands of these same base,
e low, negro radical leaders, and f
those outraged white and black men
have no idlea save vengeance. Ilow t
n is the law to stop it when the per
e petrators cannot be found ?
The killing of Laws in Feliciana is
- simply effect-Laws had no business
º- to return to that section, and the
d Times can prepare itself to hear of
b plenty more of just such "assassin
r, ations' as that of Laws and Webber b
e and Franks.

tion, after doing all they could to des- n
II troy the happiness and wealth of the
e parish, and if they are killed, as the U
e- chances are ninety-nine in a hundred
of they will be, it will be no fault of
I- ours.
to The best citizens desire these noe
r- gro ruffian politicians should stay
s, away. They demoralize labor, are
ie a constant menace to the peace and
se quiet of the country and they have
of done private wrongs to a class of e
men that will certainly take ven
7- geance in their own hands. Society, t
he which they have long and persistant
st ty outraged, cannot be made to feel
of or believe that the taking off of a
political rolber or murderer is en
ie titled to any great amount of weep
e- ing and wailing. Let the negro bum- 1
ed mers stay in New Orleans ; the citi
ne zens there seem want them, to beat
railroad improvements with. They
are good certainly to outrage somei
a thing with, public improvements for
ely instance.

'IThel Republican governments of Lou
isiana and Soulth Cmroli:a I:have yielded
i to force; they have gone downu before an
Sarmed minority whose thlreats of future
violence were guaranteed by a long
'' train of bloody deeds done ii the past.
d I regret that the character of the traus
e action should be obscured in the least by
pretended investigations or negotiations, I
- stripped of all disguises and plretenses.
ist The simpl fact ms that Packard and
Chamberlain were not able to maintain
Sthemselves in authority and the govern
I ment of the United States, in the exer
cise of its discretion, reftused them sup
port. Then, the legislatnres findling
* themselves defetceless, fell to pieces and
gh from their rluins, ia part, nlt1 legislt
tures have been constituted, whose le
Sgality consists only in the fact thati
e, there are none to oppose themn. The law
. and the rights of the majlority have
yielded to an armed and aggressive mi- I
c nority."'
ct The people of this State at least, and
- they are the majority not the minority,
- as Mr. Morton would have it, were de
termined that Nicholls shoiluhl be Gov
d ernor, and they would resist with force
of arms any attempt to foist upon them
an alien and a defeated candidate, as
had been done with Kellogg, and to this
Sdetermination, added as Morton says, to
the "guarantees" given by the 14th Sep
tember, Coushatta and Colfax that they
Swould resist, and resist terribly, Mr.
Hayes and his backers yielded.
We do not, nor never have we, propo
sed to sing peans to Ilayes for the virtu
et one necessity by wh ich he was forced to
recognize our clearly established rights,
Sand we venture to say that no one re
i- gretted so much as Mr. Hayes himself,
, the impossibility of sustaining Packard
e, and Chamberlain.
We do not discuss the open points
he made by Mr Morton of a "majority be
at ing overcome by a minority'" but make
these pertinent suggestions to show that
SMr. Hayes yielded to us in our demands
Ve for justice from a fear of consequlences,
and that he did not recognize oar rights
front any spirit of fairness or love of
e Constitution.
Mr. Hayes is a partizan, and as such
we do him the credit to say that he
proposes to stick to Reputblicanism, he.

Sry up and get some shape to their
s, material, tlhe leaders of the "new
s. men and newv measures" will all be
i in tile penitentiary. Myers and Bre
n- da as well as Carroll Jones, Neal and
' Van Densen are on the ragged edge.
Wg Where, in God's name, is the "con
ad servative element," that they allow

m leaders.
