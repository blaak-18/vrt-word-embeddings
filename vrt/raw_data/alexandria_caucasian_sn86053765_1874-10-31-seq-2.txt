I mmigration.— T elegraph.—
With our next issue we shall com
mence to agitato two questions of
much importance to our Parish.
The first and most important is the
question of White Immigration, and
the other a Telegraph. We shall
in a series of articles describe the
advantages of Rapides, its climate,
«oil, products &c., and will endeav
or to spread such information as far
we can in localities where it will be
likely to do some good. We will
publish free of charge to the adver
tiser all offers for the sale of land
to immigrants, iu small quantities
and on favorable terms to them as
to credit &c., and we invite commu
nications from all who will dispose
of lands to white immigrants on fa
vorable terms. Iu this direction
lies the solution of all our troubles
political as well as financial, and
wo hope our land owners will re
spond to our offer.
L^Vote against the amend
ments! See that your ticket is
properly fixed so as that you vote
" against the amendments !" It is
a, radical dodge, specious upon their
face but covering fraud at the bot
to:n.
THE LAST OF THZ« CAMPAIGN.
Before we shall lay before our
readers next week's paper and in
deed, with this issue, the campaign
will have closed. Whether it shall
result in our success or defeat,
whether it shall bring to ns weal or
woe, the election will be over and
our fate for the next two years de
cided cither for or against us. Ra
pides, proud, historic old Rapides,
who was ever wont iu past political
campaigns to take her place in the
front rauk of her sister parishes
who were nobly battling for the
right, can claim and is justly enti
tled to the satisfaction ot knowing
that she has nobly done her duty
this time, and on Monday she will
by an almost unanimous vote of
her white citizens record her pro
test against the ignorance and cor
ruption which have prevailed in the
high places lor eight years of radi,
cal misrule in Louisiana. Unterri
fied, undismayed by the glitter of
bayonets, the tramp of cavalry hor
ses or the clash of cavalry sabres,
every white man feols it to bo his
duty to his country, his family and
himself to march boldly, resolutely
to the polls and cast his vote for
the White People's Ticket who
promise and will give honesty and
intelligence in the management of
public affairs, a reduction of taxa
tion aud an impartial and efficient
execution of the laws. A few, only
a few laggards have failed to regis
ter and we bavé no fears of any di
vision of the vote or of any holding
back now that only half of the duty
has been performed.
The men of Rapides, most of
whom have met and vanquished on
fair fields hosts of these same "boys
in blue," are made of sterner stuff
than to be intimidated or disheart
ened at their hostile presence
amongst us now, and though every
noil in the parish was guarded by a
double file of bayonets and car
bines, they will march on Monday
next, as they have marched before
with steady tread and perfect time
to poll their votes tor the good and
true men whose election will briug
peace in the stead of this "pomp
and circumstance of war," quiet
where all is now turmoil and dis
turbance, and plenty where all is
now an unremitting struggle for the
bare necessaries of life. Williams,
Beck with aud Packard have reck
oned without their host, if they
liavç calcuiated upon scaring our
people away from the polls by any
such paltry device or any such elec
tioneering trick as sending squad
rons of cavalry and companies of
infantry into the country parishes.
Now, men of Rapides ! Steady !
Forward, March ! November 2nd,
tho goal of our hopes, the day of
Louisiana's final redemption is at
hand. No man can tell tho result
for certain in Rapides, but we will
in the State certainly elect a ma
jority of the Legislature and our
State Treasurer. New Orleans will
give from 10.000 to 15.000 majority
for us and the parishes which wiil
certainly elect their members will
secure to us, unless again deprived
of the result by force and fraud,
both a Treasurer and the Legisla
ture. Tho days of Radicalism are
numbered with "the things that
were" and it will have no further
lease of our fair and stricken State.
Freemen ! White men ! rejoice
that, the dawn of a better day is in
the East and with Monday's sun
set will witness unbound, uutram
meled Louisiana, enter upon the
high road of peace and prosperity,
which is her birth right and the
heritage of her children. Con
science stricken, beholding the
handwriting upon the wall which
made Belshazzar quake and trem
ble in tho midst of his high carni
val of debauchery and profligacy,
the radicals are clinging, to
tho vain hope that through treach
ery, fraud or the force of the
U. S. bayonets there may be some
escape from their impending doom.
They will make a desperate strug
gle to hold on, but it must and will
result in our final and glorious vic
tory.
There is everything to cheer and
nothing to discourage us in tlie
prospect, let every man stand to
his post, stand firm, bo watchful,
vigilant and active. Be ready to
detect any radical trick, stay at the
polls until every vote is cast, see
every vote counted at the polls, as
required by law, see that proper
men bring the boxes to Alexandria
and then go home with the satisfac
tion of knowing that you have (lone
, vonr dntv, your whole dutv.
I
WAR.
The present condition of Nortb
Lo uisiana differs from a «täte of ac
tual war ouly in the one circum
stance, that one side is passive and
entirely passive, while the other is
all aggressive. The echoes of the
clatter of horses feet and the rude
clash of sabre and carbine resound
through our pine forests which
have known no enemy to be con
quered nor seen any foe to be sub
jugated. Our river bottomsjand sun
ny glades awake to the hostile call
of the bugle and the merry chirrup
of our feathered songsters is bushed
at the rattle of the drum and the
piping of the fife. On all sides,
around us, above and below is seen
and heard all the notes and prepa
rations for bloody war. The tramp
of soldiery, the clash ot arms, the
neighing of steeds and the rumble
of wheels all betoken war ! war ! !
The arbitrary arrests of peaceful
citizens, the incarceration of men
who have committed no crime and
the merciless hunt of other men.
who have been tried and acquitted
of tho charge ot murder at Colfax,
all this and more, proclaims the
rule of force and announces the
forced submission of theoivil to the
military government.
We pauso to reflect, and tho en
quiry forces itself on our mind.—
Why all this military parade ? For
what is all this unnecessary perse
cution ? What crime have wo com
mitted that we should be thus over
ridden by the iron heel of a despot
ic power?
Six men were killed at Coushatta
it is true, and killed under circum
stances which do not satisfy us ot
tho justice of their death, but that
was no matter for the concern of the
United States authorities. A radi
cal District Judge, II. C. Myers
was and is Judge of that District,
the men who did the killing could
have been arrested by the Radical
sheriff of the parish and would ha\ne
been most probably tried before a
negro radical jury. What better
chances of conviction conhl bo de
sired. The State courts were open
and if the criminals were not pun
ished it is no fault of our side but
tho blame must be laid at tho radi
cal door. Why hunt tho Colfax
boys? Seven of their companions
have beeu tried and acquitted of the
crime charged against them, and in
a United States Court by a picked
jury. This settles that matter un
til theSnpremeCourt of the United
States decides the appeal upou the
Constitutionality of the Ku-Klux
act. The citizens of Shreveport
who were arrested, committed no
crime iu refusing to employ any
person of whatever color or condi
tion, who should vote to tax their
property more than it was worth,
and any law which makes such ac
tion a crime or attempts so to do is
opposed to the very first aud funda
mental principle of tho Constitu
tion which guarantees to every one
the undisturbed pursuit of "life,
liberty and property." Cosgrove,
the Editor of the Natchitoches Vin
dicator committed no crime in writ
ing able and vigorous editorials for
his paper against tho unblushing
corruption which had levied a tax
of 7!) mills upon the property of the
people of Natchitoches.
This and this only, is the head
aud front of our offending iu North
Louisiana aud yet our people are
being dragged from their homes
business is being stopped and our
country overridden by a hostile
force. The game is too thin and
too easily understood to deceive
even the most obtuse. All this
parade and persecution is to dis
hearten our people aud to draggoon
the negroes to the polls, many of
whom were satisfied to stay away
of their own accord. This is the
fair election which the double Usur
per, Kellogg, promised us. It will
not scare any of our side and we
confidently predict that more ne
groes will stay away from the elec
tion precincts and more vote with
us for honesty and intelligence in
tho government, than would have
doue so if there had not been a sol
dier in Louisiana.
er Thanks to Steamers Fleta,
Sabine and Garry owen, for paper!
I favors.
Military Arrests.
Viewed from a stand point free
from any bias or prejudice, the ar
rests in North Louisiana by the
military, present very grave and
serions questions lor settlement by
the Constitutional authorities of the
government. Some of them have
been made without warrants, and
iu the most arbitrary manner. In
the dispatches to the Bulletin , re
published by ns in another place,
it is reported that when Huey ask
ed for the authority for his arrest,
Lieut. Hodgson, in charge of the
Cavalry, drew a repeater, saying :
"This is my authority." We are
informed that when they arrested
Cosgrove, Editor of the Natchito
ches Vindicator , he demanded their
warrant, and that he was answered
by tho officer in charge, slapping
his pistol, that that was his war
rant ! We are still further inform
ed that in Grant Parish tho Cav
alry broke open corn cribs, robbed
dairies and pantries, and did other
similar acts which take them out
of the pale of the law they are pre
tending to enforce, and makes
them under the law as well as in
tact, marauders and not soldiers.
Wo propose briefly to review the
subject of the authority, power and
right of the military to make ar
rests. There is a material differ
euco in the right of the military to
arrest civilians in a eta to of war,
and in a state of peace. The ne
cessities of war know no law in
actual war, and more especially on
the domain of a hostile power, the
right of the military to arrest civil
ians is of necessity almost unlimi
ted. In peace and upon a portion
of the uatiotial domain, which for
certain well defined purposes is
national, and for other purposes no
less well defined and more compre
hensive, is not natioual, but subject
to a local authority, called a State
government, the right of the gene
ral government to .'interfere in the
affairs of that local government, is
circumscribed, bounded by strin
gent constitutional enactments,
and not susceptible of any misin
terpretation. We will examine the
question as to its applicability to
the State of Massachusetts as well
as to Louisiana.
The United States government
can make arrests of the citizens of
a State only for violation of its own
laws or of the laws of the State.
It is true that the act of Congress
commonly known as tho Enforce
ment or Ku-Klux Act, went a long
ways towards obliterating State
lines entirely, and vesting almost
unlimited authority in tho officers
of the general government, but,
even that infamous Act imposed
certain restrict ions, and under tho
ruling of Mr. Justice Bradley, in
the Grant Parish case, it was strip
ped of all its extraordinary powers.
To make arrests for violation of
tho U. S. laws, the U. S. Marshall
can proceed only upon a warrant,
which can only issue after a proper
affidavit, charging under oath some
specific offense has been prepared
and sworn to before a proper officer
authorized to administer oaths and
issue warrants. The Marshall can
only summons the aid of the mili
tary authorities in cases where re
sistance is made and then ®nly as
a posse, as they act in the capacity
of a posse comitatis and are sub
ject to tho command of tho Mar
shall, who being tho representative
of the civil authority of the govern
ment, is responsible for the good
conduct of his posse, and who must
himself serve his warrant and
make tho arrest. There is, and
there can be under the constitution
which subordinates the military to
the civil aOthority, no power grant
ed to auy military officer or soldier
to make arrests of civilians in time
of peace. The Marshall and the
officer commanding his posse, are
the representatives of two distinct
powers of the Government, and
while there ought not to be any
conflict of authority, there can not
be any blending of their powers.
We do not presume that this posi
tion will be denied or disputed.
When then Lieut. Hodgson so boast
ingly and with so much bravado
told Mr. Huey at [Tomer, that his
:artny six was his authority tor ar
resting him, be was putting himself
on a footing with the highwayman
who demands one's pitrse upon the
same authority that ha was de
manding the surrender of Mr.
Huey's liberty. When Mr. Cos
grove at Natchitoches made a sim
ilar demand and was answered
with the same insulting braggado
cia pat of a pistol, the officers in
voked the use ot a weapon wbich,
as far as the law goes might as well
have been employed by Mr. Cos
grove and his friends, to prevent
his arrest, as by this officer to
make it.
The F aib A ssociation .—There
have been two meetings of the
Board of Directors of this Associa
tion, since the dose of the Fair,
and tbey have now about settled
their accounts. An effort is now
being successfully made to obtain
stock subscriptions of one hundred
dollars C ash , from each of forty
citizens, so as to put the Associa
tion upon a firm footing. It is a
matter which should commend it
self to every one of our citizens,
and we do not suppose that they
will find any difficulty in selling
that amount of Stock.:
T he C rops .—iTome^of the Sugar
Planters, indeed, tbe most of them
have already ground portions of
their cane crop, and new Sugar and
Molasses is now coming to town
for sale and shipment. The yield
so far is good, beiug we are inform
ed about a hogshead to the acre.
The bestjpicking of tho cotton crop
is now over, and is being ginned.
The yield all over.the lowlands of
the parish averages pretty near
ly a bale to tlie acre. We have
made enough corn to'do us next
year. .
O 5 ' Kellogg says his money
transactions with Iîen Butler and
Matt Carpenter wore perfectly le
gitimate. Certainly. They were
his attorneys in court, and there
fore ho owed them fees, which he
did not pay until they were " hard
up," and in favor of Congress or
dering a new election. Then lie
shelled out when his lawyers being
easy in money matters, didn't find
it necessary to push the new elec
tion business any further. This is
perfectly satisfactory, " my dear
Kellogg."—[La. State Register
nrShoulder to Shoulder! All
together, Boys ! On Monday go to
the polls early, cast your votes as
soon as you get there ; find out if
any ot your neighbors are not there
and go and bring them up if it is
necessary. Let every man in Ra
pides put in his vote against ras
cality, theiving, bribery, high taxes
and fraud in tho government of the
State.
On dit has it that Lieut. We
llie, who by his courtesy and gen
tlemanlv deportmeut while station
ed here, wou tho esteem of all our
people was wounded in the Black
mil 's expedition of Gen. Custer,
So says a furloughed soldier of his
command now here. We are pleas
ed to learn that the wound was not
serious.
BP The-Indians must be having
a nice time, all the soldiers are
removed from the frontiers and are
in Louisiana, helping to keep Ivel
logg, the Usurper, and bis minions
iu power. Still we are not happy !
O, beneficent government ! " The
best the world ever saw."
Ci^Weare against repudiation
anyhow. Let Louisiana pay every
ôollar of her honest debt, whatever
it is. What of it is fraudulent, she
does uot'owe, but we don't like to
have Kellogg and his buzzard crew
decide what is fraudulent aud what
is not.
IV Bo quiet and orderly on elec
tion day. Let no disturbauce of
any kind give the radicals an ex
cuse or opportunity to cover up
their impending defeat. Take
more on that day than you would
on any other day in tbe year.
Remember that only those
voters living in a ward are entitled
to vote for Magistrates and Consta
bles. No one outside of the Ward
can vote for these offices in your
jWard. Challenge their votes if
; they attempt it !

Freedom of Speech,
Jas. H. Cosgrove, the bold and fear
less Editor of the Vindicator at Nat*
chitoches, has been arrested upon
some trumped np charge and is now
"in dnranoe vile." This is an outrage
for which there is no parallel since
the days when Seward used to tinkle
his little bellend order the arrest and
confinement of Editon sad whom he
pleased in the Noiftk. Soma day -a
retributive Justice will overtake the
tyrants who thus override all tbe
Constitutional rights secured 'to the
... ° '« s -r -'3.' •
citizens of what was one a free Coon
try. The bitter foe of all tyrants is a
free press and it is the one they most
fear.
We are not informed as to the
specific charge against oigr friend
Cosgrove, but we endorse any and
everything he has ever said in the
Vindicator, and if the officer who
holds the warrant for Uis arrest will
have tbe kindness to inform us what
particular articles in the Vindicator
has brought Cosgrove under the bann
of the law, we will republish them
upon our own responsibility, and he
may come after ns too. We want a
free press and if we are not to have
it we would like to know it right now,
so that we may understand 1 just where
we stand. If there is a censor of the
press in the person of every petty U.
S. Marshall whose .venom seeks to
shut off free and outspoken expres
sion of opinion, we want to know it
right now. We are in the same boat
as the Vindicator, Mr. Marshall, and
if you are paddling that canoe, pad
dle us along too. We dont like to bo
left behind.
Wilson's Sewing Machines.
Tv T e ommitted last week in our ro
port of the Fair to make any mention
of tlyj display of Wilson's Sewing Ma
chines from the popular hou e of
Messrs. Ferguson & Schnack. This
was unintentional on our part and
only happened in the hurry of hav
ing so much to do in so short a time,
as it wus holiday week at our office.
The display of their excellent Ma
chines and the work done by them
was deserving of a special mention.
We have examined the work done by
the Wilson Machine and find that
the two points of excellence nre, that
it sews alite ou both sides of the cloth
and that tbe sewing cannot rip nor
pull out by the breaking of any of the
stitches. They ore neat in appear
ance, and are much cheaper than
anyothers in the market, which in
hard times tike these is an item of
interest to most persons.
Give Messrs. Ferguson & Schnack
a call at their Store on Front Street
and examine the Machines for your
self. They do not think it any
trouble to show them nor to operate
them.
Ecksrt'a Brass Band.
The Band under the leadership of
Mr. J. F. Eckert, from New Orleans,
was in attendance tho four days of
the Fair and played with their string
instruments for the Ball. They gavo
us most excellent music, and charged
only ^ reasonable pricc. We com
mend them to the favorable notice of
all who wish to engage a first claBS
band.
Communications addressed to J. F.
Eckert, '§o. 151 Common Street, op-°
posite St. Charles Hotel, New Or
leans, La., will meet prompt atten
tion. For a delightful seranade to
this office while here, we axe under
obligations, and we appreciate tho
compliment. Success to " Eckert's

Shooting Affray .—On Sunday last
the son of Mrs. John Kelso, Georgie,
was shot at the plank road, by a ne
gro named Ernest Diggs. He was
shot in two places, once in tbe head
and through the thigh with pistol
balls. We refrain from giving details
until the prisoner, who is now in Jail f
shall have had his preliminary ex
amination. George's wounds ara
pronounced by bis physician not to
be dangerous and he is now doing
well. _
tgy Amidst the storm which rages
above, below and around us, Rapide»
is quiet, perfectly quiet. We are at
a loss to account for the fact that
Kellogg, Packerd & Co. have given
ns the goby. Small favors tbankful
' y received.
