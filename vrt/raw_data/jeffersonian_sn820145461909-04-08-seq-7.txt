be past redemption before the next
Synod shall assemble. But I verily
Relieve the proper thing to do is to
recall those in the “furrin” field and
turn them in right here, for it’s quite
sure that something has broken loose
in Georgia. If you will be at the
pains to look through the files of the
Christian. Index you will read some
thing like this: 1 ‘The Catholics of
Georgia Control the Whisky Ring”;
“The Whisky Ring Controls the
Democratic Dailies and These Con
trol Our Legislatures.” Funny, is
n’t it ? Georgia, the Empire State of
the South, tfie State that is sending
vast sums to the heathen, - is indirect
ly controlled by Catholics.
In all kindness, I believe that when
we, as a nation, become noted for the
practice of the piety that we preach
it will serve as leaven and have ef
fect on the whole lump.
Respectfully,
J. C. Parrott.
NEED ORGANIZATION EVERY
WHERE.
Heine, Ark.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Please find enclosed two
dollars, for which renew my subscrip
tion to Weekly Jeffersonian and send
me your magazine for one year, to
commence with January number.
Well, Mr. Watson, you said you
would like to hear from Populists all
over the country, but as I am 74 years
old and almost blind, I can’t get out
to see and hear much. You have a
great many friends in this state, but
we are all poor and not organized.
We had no money to put a ticket in
the field, and it seemed that the peo
ple did not go to the polls. My
school district has nineteen voters,
and six went to the polls and voted
three for Watson, two for Bryan, and
one for Debs, and I am certain that
eight of the thirteen that stayed at
hame would have voted for Watson
if they had voted at all.
Your friend, E. D. Grace.
LONG LANE WITHOUT ANY
TURNING.
Barnesville, Ga.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Enclosed please find
money order for one dollar for the
Jeffersonian for 1909. I am always
glad when I get the Jeffersonian, as
I know that what I see in it can be
relied on as facts. So here’s hoping
that you may live long and keep ahead
of Hoke & Co., and expose all of their
tricks and teachings. It is a long
lane that never turns. Every dog will
have his day unless there are more
dogs than days.
Very respectfully,
J. W. Vaughn.
ALL PARTIES ARE COMING TO
OUR PRINCIPLES.
Moultrie, Ga.
Hon. T. E. Watson,
Dear Sir: I send you four dollars.
Send the Magazine to the names en
closed. You can send the December
number if you have it, as I think it
is one of the best you ever wrote, but
I think that of every one that comes
out. Have been with you in every
paper you have published, and will
continue as long as life and the cash
hold out. Will send my subscription
for both paper and magazine when
the time expires. I want the second
volume of your History of France.
I have the first volume.
It was one of the red letter days of
my life when I saw you in Albany.
I think youi’ life has been a success,
as all parties are coming to our prin
ciples. Os course, the rascals hate
you like the devil hates holy water
for showing them up.
I use very opportunity to advance
both papers with our union, telling
them that you have done more for the
farmer and laboring man that any
other hundred men in the U. S.
With best wishes for you and yours,
I am, your friend,
R. S. Woolfolk, Sr.
IT ISN’T THE NAME THAT PEO
PLE WANT TO VOTE FOR.
Gail, Texas.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Enclosed find a two dol
lar bill for your weekly and monthly
Jeffersonians, as I have neglected
renewing. I will get all the subscri
bers I can for your valuable publica
tions. I think we ought to have a
conference and organize and fight for
principles unto the last as we have
an unflinching leader (Thos. E. Wat
son), but as to changing the name, I
think it silly, as there are lots of peo
ple who know the Populist principles
that it would take years to understand
the change of name, and if it is a
name that people want to vote for
instead of principles they ought to
have a good collection to select from
Hoping you success in your most
noble work, I remain yours to the
end, Thos. 0. Edwards.
DOESN’T BELIEVE IN STATE
PROHIBITION.
Arlington, Ga.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: My subscription has been
out for some time. I have been wait
ing for my s3l per capita to come
around, and have just now got one
dollar of it, which I enclose to re
new the Jeffersonian one year from
the date of expiration. I can not
do without it, and when the next in
stallment of that per capita comes
around I want to get Bethany. I am
with you to the death on every posi
tion you have ever taken except on
prohibitiion. I am opposed to State
ptrohibition, and individually three
fourths of the men of Georgia are
the same way. Why were they afraid
to submit to popular vote?
Yours in the fight,
D. C. Andrews.
A STOP SHOULD BE PUT TO THIS
KIND OF PRACTICE.
Cedar Keys, Florida.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: My husband is a subscri
ber to both Jeffersonians. We like
them very much.
You being such a bold champion
for the rights of the people, I have a
little matter to bring before you, and
which I would report to the Railroad
Commission if I knew their address:
On March 10th I came into Valdosta
over the Atlantic Coast Line Railway,
and transfered to the Georgia South
ern depot. I was sick. —scarcely able
to walk. Immediately on entering
that company’s waiting room, I ex
changed my mileage book for a ticket
from Valdosta to Macon, Ga. The
"Jeffersonian
Agent told me that I had better go to
a hotel as the waiting room would be
closed, locked, and lights put out at
early dark. I asked him why they
did that, as I thought it was a rail
road’s business to furnish a place for
waiting passengers, that I had pur
chased a ticket, and my train was not
scheduled to leave until 12 p. m., that
I did not wish to go out on the street
at night, and I protested against be
ing forced to leave the waiting room.
He said they closed up to save expense
of light. 1 kept protesting against
the treatment, and he finally said I
could stay inside, but the door would
be locked and lights put out. In my
enfeebled condition, I had to go out
and hire a negro to carry my grip.
Os course, I went to the nearest ho
tel, and there the proprietor informed
me that a month previous to that time
this agent turned himself (the pro
prietor) and wife and five small chil
dren out on the streets at one o’clock
in the morning and they took refuge
in the A. C. L. waiting room until
daylight.
If there is any way to make that
company keep their waiting room
open, I would like to see it enforced.
(Mrs.) J. A. Williams.
A GENEROUS OFFER.
321 S. Volusia Street,
Wichita, Kansas.
Hon. T. E. Watson.
Dear Sir: Please find enclosed
money order for two dollars to pay
for the two Jeffersonians for one more
year, for I can’t do without some re
form reading that tells the truth.
When; I read your papers I know
what I have got, for years ago I read
your writings and they always suited
me. I feel sorry the Missouri World,
has stopped. I miss it, for I took it
for eighteen years.
I am in favor of starting the cam
paign now for 1912 and get a national
organization and raise funds. I am
69 years old and poor, —no home of
my own and work by the day to get
a living, but I will give five dollars a
year to help carry on the work. 1
have been working for the cause for
34 years, have fought fusion and I
don’t want any change of name nor
any of the big liar, W. J. B.
My prayer is, the Lord protect you.
Respectfully your friend,
George Win rod.
A VERY KIND LETTER.
Munday, Texas.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Enclosed please find
names of new subscribers I am send
ing in for the weekly, and stamps to
cover.
I can hardly wait from one week
until the next to get my paper. It is
the best I ever read in my life.
May your guardian angel ever be
with you. I feel so grateful to know
that we have so grand and noble a
Southern man to fight for the South
and Southern people and their inter
ests. May God ever attend your foot
steps through the uneven journey of
this life. W. N. Huddleston

“WE CAN’T AFFORD TO GIVE
UP THE FIGHT.”
Elgin, Texas.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir: Inclosed find order
for $2, for which please renew my
weekly Jeffersonian, and send me
Jeffersonian Magazine to March, 1910,
as per your offer of recent date. No
Mr. Watson, we can’t afford to give
up the fight. Let us reorganize under
the name of the “Jeffersonian Demo
cratic Party,” or some other suitable,
name, with Tom Watson still our lead
er, and push the fight to a clean fin
ish.
Wishing much success to you, I am
your sincere friend,
T. Jeff Smith.
GLAD YOU BROKE THE SILENCE.
Hecla, S. D., March 26, 1909.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Friend: I am a constant but
silent reader of your paper and maga
zine. I look for ward with great in
terest to the various articles and dis
cussions, and I enjoy the good letters
written by so many of our people. I
admire your nerve in standing by the
truth as you see it. It has been the
style too long to cover up and let
alone for fear of disturbing the hor
net. I see you are not afraid of the
hornet’s sting. I wish we had many
more who would take up this reform
work. Best wishes for you and the
cause. A. D. Engle.
