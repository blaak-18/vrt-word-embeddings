CATHIE DANA'S LETTER.
Et Came After Many Days of
Waiting.
HE bridge over
the ravine just
east of Nugget
Scamp was fin
/ ished.
Guy Huyler,
the young civil
engineer having
the work -in
charge, had left
the camp with
his men, to build
one at the other
end of the rail
way, and trains
had been run
ning through
Nugget daily
for a week or
more.
The men in the
post office were
talking about the bridge.
"To change the subject," said Hi
King, "I wonder if we won't see the
young engineer chap back here ag'in
afore long?"
"I see whatyer drivin' atl" exclaimed
old Bob Coomer, from his seat on the
biscuit box-the post office was grocery
as well-and he smiled good naturedly.
The man next to the big miner-old
Lee Hlarding-looked at him with a
puzzled stare, then dropped his blood
shot eyes to the floor.
"Don't believe the young feller could
help lovin' Cathie Dana," Bob Coomer
continued. "I've seen stacks o' gals,
but old Mark Dana's little daughter
beats 'em all!"
"I bet he does come back," put in an
other. "I saw 'em say good-by.
Couldn't help it; but I didn't let on I
did."
"P''raps that's what made the bridge
take so long to build," said lii King,
jokingly.
"Boys," cried old Bob C',omer, look
ing through the open door down the
road. "here comes hill! Wonder if
Cathie gits a letter?"
"She hain't got one afore," said Tim
Lynch. "I've accidentally hung about
here every day since the young feller's
been gone, and when she'd come and
ask if there mightn't be suthin' for her
dad or her. lill Reid never had a
postal card even; this is near two
weeks gone by."
Just then the postmaster camenc in,
mail bag over his shoulder.
lie went behind the desk in the back
room and began to assort the letters,
which were few, and two or three pa
pers.
Bob Coomer looked sadly at his sway
ing head for a time, then turned impa
tiently toward his desk, behind which
the postmaster was sitting.
"Mail shuffled yet?"
"In a minute," the postmaster an
swered.
A short silence.
"Mail sorted?"
This time old Lee ilarding asked the
question, and sonic of the men
laughed.
"Ye ain't expectin' a love letter, be
ye, Lee?" queried lii King.
The old man did not answer.
"All done now, gents," said the post
master. "Letter for Ilii, paper for
Tim, letter for tob.'"
"Who else gets news in Nuggec?"
asked Bob.
The postmaster mentioned three
other men in the camp and said that
the rest of the mail was for the neigh
boring camp.
"\VWell," said Bob, "time to go to
work."
And le left the building with the
letter the postmaster gave him un- a
opened.
"Hlard luck!" Iii King commnnented.
"W~onder if the young engineer chap's t
forgot all 'bout Cathie?" t
"Like as not." Tim Lynch grum- a

bled. "Hope she'll forgit himnl soon. ri
I'd like to wring his neck." k
The rest. with the exception of old
Lee Harding, then sauntered out and 5(
of- to their afternoon work. si
Lee still sat there on a nail-keg. a]
"That's what the tear meant in her ia
eye t'other day,"' he mused. "Forget
'im! No; she cares for the feller, an' pC
won't. Hard luck!" C
Then he gazed up toward the desk
sadly.
Cathie Dana bad entered the low- it
ceilinged room, and was standing at
that part of the counter where the B
postmaster gave out the mail. H
Her head was uncovered and her Ca
dark hair fell over her shoulders. hi
With one hand she brushed it back at
as she faced the postmaster.
'"Some sugar?" he asked; "you must
be 'bout out to-day." - B
"Is there no mail for dad or me'?" m
she said, hopefully. H
Then, when the. postmaster told her jt
there was none, old Lee IHarding saw sm
her draw a letter from her pocket and
leave it in thba letter box. sc
"Writin'to him," he mused. "'She tl
think's he's ill orsomethin'."

wonder if an answer'll come. I'll

Of The next day, and each noon after
that, he was there when the mail ar
rived. -
rer Cathie Dana would come, a look of
sst hope on her sweet face, and then go
ret away disheartened, for no answer ever

I A CHEST FOR NAPERY.
U ow an Up-to-Date Woman Takes Catr
of Her Table Ilen.
1 A country woman up to date gave us
tI some clever suggestions about napery.
She kept her generous supply in a
if wooden chest, about one yard long,
'o two feet high and two feet wide.
r The chest was placed in the embras
B ure of a dining-room window. and
served also as a window seat. It was
made of pine, finished with. yellow
it enamel paint, ornamented with exten
sive brass hinges, handles and key
* hole. A fiat hair cushion covered in
b gay Matteau chintz fitted its top. It
moved easily upon rollers and opened
readily to the insertion of the key kept
r- in the good woman's possession.
A wooden tray, five inches deep,
it greeted the eye inside. This held nap
e kins, doylies. carving clothes and cen
ter pieces. Beneath was ample space
d for a good assortment of table linen
used in the home. The bottom of the
e tray and that of the chest was nicely
o padded with a sachet bag made of yel
I low cheese cloth *perfumed with laven
der and orris root.
a Such a chest is readily made out of a
pine box, and its position in the dining
r room has the extra advantage of being
i directly at hand in case of emergency,
or upon the advent of an unexpected
I guest.
SHousekeepers usually have a care to
expense; they set their dinner table
with fresh napery and use the same for
the breakfast and luncheon following.
t The digestion is usually weak after the
night's inactivity and one likes to be
a greeted in the morning with fresh
napery, whatever its quality may be,
glassware and silver, a sparkle from
I hot water and ammonia, -crisp fruit.
invigorating coffee and hot rolls as a
t stimulus to the day's work.
The laundry will attest that fre
quent washing of slightly soiled nap
ery is much better in results than
hard washing of really dirty linen oc
I casionally.
For breakfast and luncheon napkins
our good woman tells us she uses un
bleached muslin. Suitable quality may
1 be purchased for six cents a yard; one
yard will make nine napkins of useful
r size.
Breakfast napkins have an inch hem.
hemstitched about their edges; a half
inch inside of the hemstitching threads
of the material, producing a decorative
border. This is the simplest process o
drawn work and easily mastered.
Luncheon napkins may be fringed, the
fringe being overhanded or caught itn
bunches by means of needle and thread
for durability. An initial outlined in
one corner finishes a napkin nicely.
Cloths to match these napkins are
attractively made of Ozenburg, which
is as cheap and as durable and comes in
greater width than the unbleached
muslin. and matches it well in texture
and surface.
Fresh-laundried and neatly-kept,
such homespun napery will have a
charm of its own. for it is pleasant tc
use and to touch.
The hostess explains that being of
Berman extraction, since her little girl
hood she has been accumulating and
embellishing for her own future house
hold linen, towel and napery. feeling
that anything so closely approaching
the personal needs as these are best
and most delicate when providently
prepared against the future. Thi.
had been her training. .she added:
that while living in the country, each
Sunday she brings forth the best of her
home and her larder for the general
family use, and saves nothing better
"for company." as she wishes to rear
her children in touch with the very
best she knows, that later, when they
go into the world mayhap, they will
not underrate the simple home and its
tender memories and sacred associa
tions, because overawed by finer quali
ties.
Economy in household matters must
rise from judgment and in its pursuit a
,vise wife and mother will not forget
that the familiar associations about
the home are educating.-D)etroit Free

Cold milk rice is made by boiling
over a slow fire half a pound of thor
oughly cleansed rice in one and one
qlnarter quart of milk or cream. with a
pinch of salt, a stick of cinnamon and
the peel of a lemon, until the rice has
swollen enough to make a moderately
stiff porridge. Remove from the tire,
take out the cinnamon and lemon peel,
stir thoroughly. and fill a mold which
has been wet with cold water. When
cold, turn into a dish and serve with
any favorite sauce, or simply with milk
or cream. If the flavor of bitter
almonds is palatable, chop half a dozen
fine and stir into the rice before put
ting into the rtold. A variation of this
dish is to fill the mold with alternate
layers of rice and stiff marmalade and
serve with cold wine sauce.-N. Y. Ad

Charity.
Women are far too economical in the
use of kind words. In bestowingpraise
they are absolutely stingy. If mothers
are critical and uncharitable. what can
be expected of the children? No one
is perfect. Teach your lips to speak
pleasant words daily, and to avoid evil
communication. Idle gossip shlould
never influence you in your treatment
of persons Learn its source, learn its t
truth, and then be governed by good
sense in the matter. And do not lend a
fine powers of conversation in speak- I
ing evil tidings of others. If you can i
not speak well of your acquaintances *
and friends do not talk about them. I
No one escapes calumny-the greatest
and purest of men and women are
forced to endure it. but banish it from
your own mouth.-N. Y. World.

"But I don't want to buy your bak

"Why, madam." he said, "you are

the matter of economy alone; this bak

bread so light you won't have to iase

5 confusion of
S bewildering temptations this autumn
4 season, for wherever the eye may turn,
there is found richness, novelty and
rare elegance. Just enough of the
picturesque element is added to the
newly-opened textiles and garnitures
e to make them increasingly attractive.
r The materials which enter very large
ly into the composition of the new
e handsome toilets and costumes of the
season consist, in a great degree, of
rare combinations in silk and wool, in
mixtures of brocade or moire -and
corded silk, or exquisite light-weight
wools to be made up with satin or vel
vet, plain or fancy in style. A great
variety of fabrics in black are brought
out in silk, satin, wool and fancy
mixtures. Some of these are in bro
caded effects, while others are plaid
ed, checked or striped.
This season very stylish separate
coats are made, that are not designed
to match the gown in color, still there
is a certain harmony between it and
the costume, which it is to complete,
not eclipse.. Dark green, 'lark blue
and black can be worn almost indis
criminately with any gown.
the most fashionable skirt of the
season is in three pieces-one part coIn
posing the front and sides, and in the
back are two gored breadths with a
seam down the center. The bell skirt
and the seven-gored model also re
main in popular favor, though the first
named style is a novelty. Some of the
new tailor gowns show a. slightly
draped overdress slashed open at one
side to show a velvet underskirt, or a
panel to give the idea of such founda
tion. The overdress is arranged to
show the velvet, but not prominently.
The other extreme is the stately and
enveloping French redingotes, which
not a few de- 1
signers and 1
tailors think n
are the most 1
distinguished
looking street
garments that
are made. Real

these colors in covert, Venetian and
ladies' cloth are used in the making o'
various natty coats in Duchess of
Y'ork, princess and double-breastedt
English walking jacket styles, and
capes likewise, in shapes innumerable.
Fancy waists of every description are
in the height of fashion, and many
women for this season have made one
or two black satin, silk or striped
moire and faille skirts of stylish cut
and hang, and by the aid of some
of these smart bodices they vary

GODS MADE TO ORDER.
the Chinese variety Are of Both Senes, and
All Sise and Prices.
Josses come from Amoy and Canton,
where there are joss factories which
supply Celestials with any shape, de
sign or size desired. Josses are either
male or female. If the former they are
fat and ungainly, if the latter they are
possessed of four arms.
The making of these images is sim
plicity itself, the manufacturers relying
upon wooden or metal moulds. These
are filled with wet clay, which dries, is
then touched up, dipped in molten
glaze and allowed to cooL An average
workman can make a hundred gods in
a day. The clay used is kaolin, and is
shaded from red and gray to white,
and costs about one cent a pound. A
good joss maker can earn from twenty
to forty cents a day, while an
image costs to make on an av
erage about three cents. Natives
pay five cents for them, foreigners five
dollars. Josses can be made in all col
ors, opaque, transparent .or colorless.
The most effective work is made by
painting the clay with thick white
paint and then dipping it in the glaze.
Chinese curio-dealers are very fond of
antique josses, as they can be planted
and dug up to order from the time of
Confucius to the present day. The
most popular is the "black joss." This
is made by painting a kaolin cast with
paint made of tar, bitumen, shellac or
varnish, wrapping it in paper and then
firing it in a furnace. In this way any
shade of black can be obtained and the
color burns through, as can be proven
by breaking.
The josses carved from wood and
covered with gaudy colors are often
very ancient. The prices vary from a
few cents to five hundred dollars
or more, according to the size, work
manship and amount of decorations.
They range in size from an inch to ten
or twelve feet. In the larger sizes the
carving is of a superior quality and the
coloring admirable. Josses carved out
of stone are rare and expensive. Those
made of jade. pale green or light blue,
fetch marvelous prices, while white,
yellow or brown are almost as expen
sive. One of these, belonging to Lin,
the ex-governor of Formosa, is about
eight inches high and is valued at ten
thousand dollars. It is said to be one
thousand five hundred years old. In
Fuchan they make josses out of stealite
and selinite of various colors. The
stone is so soft that the manufacturer,
by rubbing the newly made images
with sand, can produce a most decept
ive antique appearance.-N. Y. World.
REIGN OF COMMON PEOPLE.
An Assuralnce That Future tWars Most I
Have Reasonable (iroands.
We are frequently told by cynical
critics that democracy is on its trial, I
but when the democracy demands the
abolition of standing armies, or urges
a mutual disarmament, it gives a good
answer to critics of this type. Such
facts are sufficient in themselves to en- I
able us to contrast the blind and stag- E
nant selfishness of callous autocracies
with the advance possible under s
broader forms of government which i
stimulate the progress of our race by
putting the destinies of humanity in
to its own hands. We have in
such expressions of the popular a
voice an evidence of a growing s
sense of minorl] und intellectual
self-respect among the commoln n people a
of the nations of the world. We are a
coming to the time when the peasant C
and the artisan will inquire into the a
merits of a quarrel in which they are a
ordered to sacrifice themselves. They
may refuse to stand up to be shot down 1
without asking questions, and not be so a
easily led away by appeals to that I
spurious patriotism which has ever
been the device by means of which am- *
bitious monarchs and wily statesmen b
have sought to mnake their quarrels t
those of communities. Hitherto we
have had democracy in name rather
than in fact. The way in which the
sayings and doings of monarchs and
statesmen are chronicled by the press;
the manner in which such people have
been allowed to act without question
upon affairs of the gravest concern to v
humanity; the extent to which they
have been able to count upon the sup
port of the people in any war they
might resolve upon: the levity often r
shown by them toward the interests of
the people-without whose support the c
most powerful among them would be
reduced to the level of common clay- 8
in such matters we have proof of the
extent to which we are still governed
by men whose chief claim to govern
often consists of the fact that their an
cestors did the same thing before them.

Mistaken Economy.
I have lately been reading some re
ceipes for making vinegar in a current
magazine -vinegar "evolved"' from ap
pie cores and peelings, and the rins
ings from sauce-dishes, soured fruits,
and so on. Those housekepers may be
neat, but I for one object to their meth
od of making vinegar. I may eat dirt
and not know it, but I certainly will
not eat dirt when I do know it. Turn
ing "'slops" and other refuse into vine- 1
gar is not a sign of economy, but poor
judgment, and it is a practice that is
as uncleanly as it is uncalled for.

[Crom the Mt. Sterling (lL.) Republican.]
Few men are held in higher esteem by
their fellow-townspeople than James W.
Stout, of Riply, IlL, and it is due, no doubt,
partly to this popularity that the recordof
the case has created such widespread inter
est. While his experience is not without
an equal, yet it has been suaciently remark
able to demand the attention of thousands
of people in Illinois, among whom are nnm
bered some of the most eminent physicians.
In January, 198, Mr. Stout was strilken
with what was then believed to be soatir
rheumatism, and in a short time was barely
able to hobble around on crutches, and it
seemed to his friends that his days were
numbered. To-day he is a strong, heary
looking manfor 190 poonds
How this wonderful change was brought
about is most interesting as toldt to a repre
sentative of the Republican by Mr. Stout
himself:
"I was afflicted with sciatic rheumatism
and lumbago in January, 1896. The sciatic
nerve on the right side became affected in
the hip, running down to the ankle and
across the small of the back to the left side,
and soon my whole system became afMicted,
causing me the most excruciating pain. In
a very short time I become totally unable to
attend to any business whatever, and the
disease rapidly growing worse I had to take
to my bed, where I lay suffering almost con
tinuously for months the most agonising
torture, scarcely being able to move or be
moved. At one time I lay for six weeks flat
on my back, the slightest movement eansing
me such pain as almost to throw me into
convulsions. I cannot begin to express to
you the intense pain I suffered. I was drawn,
by the severeness of the malady, over to the
left side; lost my appetite, had no desire for
food, and what little I did eat I could not di
gest, the digestive organs failing to perform
their duty, adding greatly to my already pre
carious condition. For weeks at a time
was unable to eat or sleep, suffering all the
time most intensely and at times fearing I
would lose my reason, and would have welt
comed death to relieve me of my sufferings
"I consulted with local physicians and
some of the most eminent specialists of the
larger cities throughout the country, some
treating me for one thing and some for an.
other, but without effect, and I received no
elief whatever. One physician told me I
had double curvature of the spine and would
eventually become paralyzed. I spent hun
dreds of dollars in the short time I wad
afflicted without receiving the least benefit.
My friends all thought that there was no
hope for me whatever and said that I mus '
die, and I, myself, had almost given up in
despair, when, in September, 1898, about
eight months after I was first afflicted, my
attention was called to Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills for Pale People. Without much hope,
I at once sent to C. F. Rickey & Co., Drug
gists, Mt. Sterling, Ill., and procured some
of the pills and immediately began taking
them. Before long I becameaware of a great
change for the better in my almost hopeless
condition. My appetite came back and my
digestive organs performed their usual
functions properly. I took some more and
grew rapidly better-could sit up in a chair
and mybody began to straighten out; con
tinued the treatment and in a short time wa
able to be about on crutches. My recove
from that time on was very rapid and assured.
idy right leg, which before I commenced this
treatment, was numb and dead, now expe
rienced a pricking, ting-sgi rensation. I
was enabled to throw away my crutches
and walk upgight once more among my fel
lows, a better man physically than ever be
fore. When first tken by the cdsee I
weighed 160 pounds, was reduced to 115: I
now weigh 166, more that I ever weighed at
any time in my life. Yes. sir I lay my re
covery entirely to Pink Pills."
