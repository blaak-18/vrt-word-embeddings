& It was when the wedding journey
Was being discussed that Helen
broached her plans. And Helen had a
charming way all her own, as her
fiance had discovered long ago. But
it happened that in this particular
instance the charming way was un
necessary for Leonard was quite will
ing to consent to her wishes.
“ Mother and father will be so
lonely without me,” Helen explained,
wistfully, 4 ‘and after the first year
when they are accustomed to the
thought that I belong to you, we
might take up housekeeping for our
selves. ’ f
“Os course, dear, we shall do ex
actly as you please,” the young man
responded; “we’ll be a happy family
together. ’ ’
So it was settled, and after the hon
eymoon, the radiant young persons re
turned to the parental home and set
tled down to real life.
Helen’s parents were delighted to
have their daughter with them. The
mother’s eyes were tearful when she
clasped the returned bride, and she
kissed the glowing cheek tenderly.
‘ 1 But it is hardly as it was, Helen, ’ ’
she whispered, tremulously, “for now
you belong to someone else, and are
not my little girl any more.”
Helen stroked the white hair fond
ly-
“Just as much as ever,” she de
clared: “everything shall be exactly
as before.”
As the only child, Helen had been
• somewhat spoiled. She was willing
that the’spoiling process should con
tinue and Leonard did what was to be
expected, blissfully unconscious that
he might be laying up trouble for
himself.
When dinner was announced on the
night of the young couple’s return,
Helen trailed down the broad stairs
looking especially bewitching. Her
blue eyes sparkled and her lips curled
entrancingly.
“Here’s your place now, Len—op
posite mine,” she cried. “We’ll
move this vase so we can see each
other.”
Leonard attempted to retain the
hand which he had caught as they de
scended the stairs, but half blush
ingly the girl drew it from him. They
were not alone, Leonard realized with
a half sigh.
Helen’s father beamed on them
from the head of the table.
“Now, Leonard,” he suggested,
“don’t forget to eat, just because
Helen sits opposite to you. You re
quire a little nourishment, you
know.”
Leonard smiled, but somewhere,
deep within his heart, there seemed
to stir a remembrance of what he had
dreamed his home-coming with his
bride would be. Yet the thought was
intangible and elusive. Did it mean
a slight disappointment?
But the dinner progressed merrily.
The wedding trip was freely dis
cussed.
“Nothing was lacking,” Helen
said vivaciously, 11 except that at
times I missed you both and wished
that you were with me.”
The girl looked fondly at her par
ents, and they, glancing back at her,
seemed to smile a little sadly. Leonard
felt decidedly out of it.
But he put unworthy thoughts from
him. In marrying an only child and
one worshipped as was Helen, he
must to some extent share her with
others. He accused himself vigorous
ly of selfishness.
Next morning he arose early and
went downstairs. In the little sewing
room overlooking the garden, Helen’s
mother sat. She looked up brightly
as she heard Leonard.
“Oh,” she cried, “I should like to
talk to you for a moment. Have you
time?”
Leonard sat down near her in an
swer to her question.
“Now,” he said, “I have just five
minutes to spare.”
“I think I can tell you all I want
to in that space of time,” the mother
replied. She looked steadily into his
manly face before plunging into her
subject.
“Len,” she said, very softly, “you
are Helen’s husband and as that you
are very dear to us. There are two
or three little things that I should
like to say to you regarding her. In
the first place, Helen has never been
disturbed in the morning. I have al
ways believed that she should sleep
until she awakens. You will let this
continue, won’t you?”
Again a vague unrest clutched the
young husband, but he answered
brightly:
‘‘ Os course, Helen shall sleep as
long as she desires. I want her to
enjoy the same comforts now as be
fore. ’ ’
A month later, as Leonard sat at
his lonely breakfast with the morning
paper lying beside him, his wife glid
ed softly into the room. In a moment
he was on his feet, his arms opened
to gather her in. With a little fur
tive glance around that had become
habitual with her, she sprang toward
him.
“'So glad to see me, dear?” she
asked.
“So glad to see you, dear one,” he
repeated, joyfully.
1 ‘Well, you owe this to Mother,”
she answered, as she withdrew from
his embrace. “‘She suggested that
we call on the Herberts today, and I
assented. They live out in the coun
try. Mother wanted to go this after
noon and stay until tomorrow, but I
wanted to go early this morning.”
Leonard’s heart sank. It was not
for him that she had risen early. No
thought seemed to enter her mind that
he should be consulted in any way.
But at dinner time, Helen had not
arrived home. A telegram directed to
her father and signed by her mother
announced that they had decided
after all to remain away over night.
Leonard excused himself early and
went upstairs. For some indefinite
reason, he sought for the old pipe
he seemed to desire its dumb company
that he had smoked when at college;
tonight.
He wondered where the mistake
lay, for a mistake there surely was.
'Suddenly he believed that he knew.
And it was such a little thing, too.
He should have been given the seat
at the head of the table! Then he
3effersonlan
laughed scornfully at himself for the
only tangible thought that sprang
from the chaos of his mind. Was
that the trouble? And why should
he be given the head of the table in
another man’s home?
He was tired; and he could not
wrestle with the question, for any
solution that came showed him in a
selfish light. He should be willing
that Helen receive all the comforts
to which she had been accustomed.
Then an illuminating idea came.
Why not have the vacant room next
to his dressing room made into a
little den? Then he and Helen could
come upstairs after dinner, and he
could take her hand and kiss her
openly as she moved near him with
out calling forth that furtive expres
sion. Yes, that was what he missed,
the frank exchange of caresses, the
frank expression of his love and ad
miration that, no matter how sincere,
would sound out of place to listeners.
So the next evening, at the first
opportunity, Leonard put the ques
tion to his wife and waited anxiously
for her answer.
“But, Len, dear,” she protested,
“mother and father would be so lone
ly if we came upstairs after dinner.
And mother is so sensitive, and she
might think that we did not care for
her company.”
All resistance seemed to leave the
husband. He did not attempt to
argue.
“Very well,” he assented, listless
ly; “just as you please.”
And soon the inevitable happened.
Leonard became a frequent visitor at
the club. The first night that he
went there he left at midnight. He
experienced a little sinking of the
heart as he opened the front door of
his home. What would Helen say?
But Helen was asleep with a little
smile on her lips, and just as he en
tered the room, the white-haired
mother emerged therefrom. She held
up a warning finger.
‘‘ Be very quiet, Len, ’ ’ she mur
mured. “Helen does not sleep sound
ly upon first going to bed. I’ve just
tucked her in. ’ ’
Helen seemingly had no need of
him. That was the secret, he be
lieved, bitterly.
Then a resolution formed quickly
in his mind. Nearly a year had
elapsed since his marriage. He would
broach the subject of a home of their
own. His face brightened, as pleas
ant thoughts presented themselves to
dispel the gloomy ones.
How wonderful it would seem!
Helen walking to the station to meet
him; the little dining-room table at
which he might sit and watch her
sweet face, unobserved by other eyes
than hers. He would be glad to have
Helen’s mother visit them in his
home, the home that he had prepared
for his wife. And then the long
evenings together. He would insist
upon a lamp in the sitting-room. Helen
would sit on one side of it and he on
the other. I a would read his paper
and perhaps Helen would sew. He
had never se i her sew, he now re
membered.
Dearest of !1 was the thought that
she would come to him for every-
thing; that she might ask his opin
ion and consult his wishes.
Unconsciously he found himself
whistling, and he felt happier than
he had since his marriage.
That night he waited impatiently
until Helen returned from the thear
ter. die remained in their room un
til she came upstairs. He had learned
to wince when the mother advised
him not to talk too long to Helen as
she was sleepy, or to be careful that
she was warmly covered. He felt that
alone he could see to all that. Did
not the girl belong to him?
Hastily he put the crowding
thoughts from him as his wife en
tered the door. She came in, a vision
in fairy white.
“Oh, Len!’’she exclaimed. “You
are at home! lam so tired!”
“Are you, sweetheart?” he an
swered lovingly. “Let me loosen
your coat.”
She came to him and held her face
up while he fumbled with the hook.
Then, when the fastening fell
apart, Len lifted the dimpled chin of
his wife and looked longingly into her
eyes.
“You are tired, little girl, I know,”
he commenced; “but I can’t wait.
Helen, the year is nearly up. Shall
we go to a home of our own?”
He waited breathlessly for her an
swer.
Helen drew taway petulantly.
“Oh, Len,” she protested; “not
yet! lam so happy here with moth
er. And she would grieve so.”
“Very well,” Leonard answerd, at
once; then he added hastily: “I was
a fool for ever consenting to live
here. ’ ’
Helen’s face paled, but she did not
speak at once. Then as she removed
her hat she looked wonderingly at
him.
“I am very sorry that you feel this
way,” she finally said; “it is some
thing that I cannot understand.”
He did not reply, and in unbroken
silence they retired.
From that time the breach daily
widened. Club life claimed Leon
ard’s entire attention, and Helen,
though at times very pale land quiet,
still continued her unceasing round
of gaiety.
Then one day Leonard overheard
a conversation which quickened his
desire to change domestic affairs as
they now stood. The firm he repre
sented desired to send a man to an
other state to open new offices.
“We would offer the position to
Reynolds,” Leoniaad heard the presi
dent say; “but his mother is ill.”
Almost without thought, Leonard
made up his mind to ask for this
position. He would have spoken
then, but the chance did not present
itself. He felt confident that the
position would be given to him should
he desire it.
As usual he spent the evening at
the club. It was after midnight when
he arrived at home.
Contrary to the usual custom,
Helen was not asleep when her hus
band came in. iSihe sat near the lamp
in the library reading. Her mother,
who would never retire until Helen
