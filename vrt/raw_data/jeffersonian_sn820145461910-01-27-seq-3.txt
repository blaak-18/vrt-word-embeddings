From the President of Local No. 1434
Dear Sir:—Since writing to you
before, I have written to our State
President, John L. Lee, and asked
him if he could tell me why we have
never received dividends from the
great Implement Company that we
have at Union City, in which a good
many of us have stock, and he failed
to answer my question.
I also asked him why they re
moved W. W. Webb from the Presi
dency of the Amalgamated Ware
house Company: this he failed to an
swer.
I also asked him a good many
questions in regard to Ladson, Bo
denhamer. Duckworth and Barrett,
and he refused to answer them.
I was at a stockholders’ meeting in
this county last week, which I at
tended to warn the members that
there was something going on up at
Union City that they had not heard
of, and the cry went up “Watson”!
Some said that you were trying to
“Bust the Union”. Others said you
busted the Alliance. But when I
asked them if they could prove those
things, they said that they could not.
I would like to send President Lee
your letter, which I have, and will
do so at your consent. My local
seems to believe every word of the
letter from you. We are getting sore
about our money. I have a letter
that I would be glad to send you from
J. L. Lee.
Wishing you success,
Yours truly,
S. B. HALSTEAD,
President Local 1434, F. E. C. U.
Whigham, Georgia.
The Duck That “Feathers His Own
Nest ”
Dear Friend:—As all the ilk of
Satan, as well they may, seem to be
arrayed against you, I want to say
to you, byway of encouraging you in
Jeffersonian
your heroic fight against the Duck
that “feathers his own nest,” the
fanatic who favors giving to the edu
cation, feeding and medical treat
ment of the black and yellow races
to the neglect of the white children
of their own native land, and, also,
the Socialist and the Catholic, who,
with insolent assurance, would
wreck home and all that civilization
has gained during the ages that are
past over ignorance, dead-beatism
and sensuality.
I want to say in this connection,
too, that am a Methodist, a Union
man and an old Alliance man, and a
Granger, and, therefore, capable to
know, by the past acts of prominent
men, like yourself, who is a friend to
the laboring masses. I know how
you sacrificed a seat, for life, in
Congress to stand by and defend the
demands of the Alliance, when such
men as Livingston, and his ilk, were
deserting us for popularity and to
“feather their nests.” So I want you
to know, Mr. Watson, that though
Duck may dodge, and Lee may fume,
and Bodenhamer—the word, in
Dutch, I presume, means Boodle
snatcher—may deny being a city
editor, we Union men, who “are all
wool and a yard wide,” know you
too well and too favorably for their
kind to injure you in our eyes.
Lovett may snort and Cofer may
hint, but the common people of this
country know whom to trust, when
we have known him long and favor
ably, as we have you. I wrote
Duck on December 4th, telling him
that his silly attempt to ignore the
bold and serious charges made by
you against him would not <lo; but
for him, if he could, to deny them in
his paper, or elsewhere, in a public
way; or, if he could not, to step out
of our way and let the Union live;
but he paid no more attention to my
letter than to answer by a private
letter, and say he would not go into
a “political discussion,” etc. I wrote
for my manuscript, but he said he
had forgotten the letter, and it
might be in the waste basket, but
for me to tell him what I had writ
ten, etc., and, maybe, he could find
it.
From this time on, when I have
anything to say to a Union man, I
shall say it, if not by private letter,
through one of your papers. You
will, I believe, give us a hearing.
You will, I am sure, knock the cover
off that well-feathered nest of
Duck’s, if any one can. Uncover him,
Tom, uncover him’ Show up Lee,
too; and Boodle and all the Union
City gang!
Union men', look out for breakers’
Don’t let such cowardly importa
tions run us out of the Union!
Let us run them out and, if neces
sary, reorganize on the old Newt.
Gresham basis.
One that would like to drive the
Duck off his nest, and let others see
what is under him.

More About Duck, Bode, Ladson
and Lee
Dear Sir: —I want to say in regard
to those Farmers’ Union leaders,
Duck, Bode, and Ladson, and John
Lee, that they remind me of a young
opossum. They are grown to the
Union pap. Did you know that when
an opossum let loose the teat he
never gets hold again? The reason
they won’t publish both sides in the
Union News is because their deeds
are evil. I have learned long ago
that when a man will practise de
ception in one thing, he will in an
other. Everything goes to Union
City, like all roads led to ancient
Rome.
Turn on the light. Just as you
say, if those men were Union men at
heart, they would resign; but if
they turn loose that pap, the old
Union City cow will be dry, or a
very lean stripper. I would like to
see some of their tax receipts before
they got on to the Union wagon. I
wrote Duck and John a long letter,
and told them where they were driv
ing our Union, and then I wrote my
objections to raising the dues, for
publication in the Union News. All
the recognition I got was a letter
from John stating that I had not
acted a gentleman. All right, John,
good-bye. Next July, if I go to the
