A Fine Old Game for Beys.
The old game of hare and hounds is
gaining new popularity and being
played by many boys nowadays.
Any number of persons may play the
game. One or two of the players are
LI chosen as hares, and each is provided
a with a bag filled with torn pieces of pa- I
* per, which are called "scent."
- The hares start off together, the rest I
I of thf players, who are called hounds, I
I not being allowed to see the direction
I they take. When five, ten, or fifteen
I minutes--as may have been agreed
upon-have elapsed the hounds set off
in pursuit of the hares. In their bunt
they are guided by the scent, handfuls
of which are thrown out by the hares i
Sas they cover the course, .
Usually it is agreed beforehand that
the run shall be a certain number of
. miles or for a certain length of time. If
a bound catches one of the hares within
- the specified distance he wins; other
wise the hares win.
If a hound catches sight of the hares
he and his companions may not cut
across and run toward them directly,
but he must follow the course of the
scent, although sometimes rules are
made allowing this to be done, under
which circumstance it is, of course,
perfectly allowable.
Very often chalk is used In place of
paper, the hares making marks upon
trees, walls and pavements. This is
not, however, as satisfactory as paper
for scent. The scent should be white in
summer and black in winter. The
reason It should be black In winter is
that in this way the sounds will be
enabled to more easily follow it.
This game is often played by rival
clubs, two rival peeks of hounds conati- r
n ttaing the whole pack. The game is d
then decided by adding together the t
numbers representing the order In
whleh the two elubs nislhed.

to have received the efollowing story
frm a Flreahmsa livgs in Berlin:

drove at eace at an early hour to the
French embassy. M. Herbette had only
just got up, and when the illustrious
visitor put la his a ppearnce he had
just begun to dress. The emperor, who i
had to be itnformed of this. amiably sent
him word that h. was net to put himself
out ef the way at all, but to eme fJust U
, as Ihe was. He eselqueatly appearedI
in his dressing gown, and the emperor
joked him about his early rising. But
then the emperor asked mselously what
She thought of the surprising news.
"What news?' answered M. Her
bette, astonished.
"Why, tht from Paris." g
"I have met yet opened the telegrams
and know of no important news."
He was horriled whom the emperera
told hLm sheet the reignstios and il

point of fact, the art of conversation is I

lerity of constant practice. In many I

at time of all others when worry should be
O banished, if only for the sake of physi
cal comfort. Yet this tI. the very time

All tkis should be changed. It ought
th to be a rule in all households that dis
ad agreeables are to be banished at meal
time. If complaints must be made let
or them come at a proper time, but do not
imperil your digestion by eating while
as you are in an irritated and discon
tented frame of mind. Pleasant talk,
ne relieved by an occasional laugh, will be
more beneficial than pounds of pills. In
the household there should not only
a, be an avoidance of unpleasant topics
to but an attempt to find agreeable ones.
Each member of the family should come I
at to the table prepared to say something
pleasant. Any bright little story or
merry joke, or any bit of world's news
that will loosen the tongues and cause
animated talk -how it will increase the i
brightness of the working (lay. There 1
need be no profund discussion, it should I
ht be just lively touch and go talk.

A Losg Shadow.
The length of the shadow which
the earth casts into space has attract
ed some attention since the eclipse of
the moon. This shadow is in the
form of a cone with the diameter of
the earth as its base. It is 864.000
miles long. That is if you traveled
into space, away from the earth,
more than three times as far as the
moon, the eLadow would still shield
you from the sun, provided you re
mained on what may be called the,
night side of the earth. Thediameter

have his hereditary ecclesiastical
status duly recognized. As kaiser he
is *'summus episcapus." i. e.. pope of
the German Lutheran church, the
established church of the empire, and
he has decided to occupy a pulpit and
preach. The kaiser is a crank. and
his people have patiently submitted to
many wild vagaries at his hand, but
he cannot expect this last act to pass
without a challenge. Even the Ger

young man he retained possession of

driver. line day, eight months after
becoming a slave, he was sent to the
coast with 1001) slaves in his charge
with loads of fruit, dye woods and
coffee. Arriving at the coast, young
Aufdemhaus found that the vessel to
which the goods in his care were con
signed was the same vessel on which
he had come to Brazil, and he lost no
time in explaining his situation to tJhe
captain, who agreed to take him back
provided he could escape. The ves

last of the goods had been placed on

ashore, and before they had reached
