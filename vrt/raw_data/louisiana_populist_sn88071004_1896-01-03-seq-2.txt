. Curpct-Ban Popu:iurts.
This is a new title which our
neighbor, the Enterprise, applies
to us in the hope that it will take
the place of argument, which can
not be adduced against our poli
ties.
The Enterprise used very bad
or. grammar, or else it intended the
article for this editor alone, and
endleavored to hide in a plural
noun, the personality shown in a
- ingular verb.
"They come to acquire pilae and
pelf," says the Enterprise, and yet
it knows that we are not eligible to
any office, and have asked for none :
also, that we are makinm less wages
on this paper than the poorest
printer on the Enterprise gets.
MT The Enterprise has a xone with
, lots of meat on it, and not having
t' received it from the people of this
r parish, is so afraid of losing it,
b that it growls and snarles every
time a hungry cur pa.sses in sight.
"They own no prol)erty, pay no
taxes, and have no interest in the
community save their own aggran
SC disement," continues the Enter
prise. How does it know that we
own no property? There's been
no investigation made. Its Demo
cratic Assessor, nor any of his de
puties, has never called on us. We
have the best claim on about $1000
worth of property subject to taxa
tion, in this parish, and would have
already paid the taxes on same, but
for Democratic official negligence.
Guess the Enterprise needed an
argument and the Assessor was
obliging enough to neglect his du
ty to furnish it. We've been told
that he's a very obliging man;
that he assessed the Kaffic store on
Front Street, at $5000, when it
cost about $18,000.
We are almost persuaded from
this article that the Enterprise be
lieves our Creator unable to make
man alone, and requires "property"
complete his citizenship. Acting
on that belief, the Democratic par
* ty demands the passage of the suf
S- frage amendment, and consequent
-destruction of manhood suffrage.
- But against its present stand for
[ property, the Enterprise and its
party, no longer than 1892, dis
,franchised whole families of the
Slargest property holders in this
- parish by "doctoring" the poll
books, because, forsooth, these
families did not intend to vote
with the Enterprise and its faction ;
and to-day, we are told that at
least two of the Enterprise's can
didates for prominent offices do not
own a dollar's worth of property
in their own name, but have smug
gled it behind some one else's
name.
Thus we find that it is not our
lack of property which is giving
the Enterprise the night-mare,
but because we do not intend to
vote for it to continue to "acquire
place and pelf."
We wish to say to the Enterprise
that we started life $40 in hand
sad $60 on debt, total assets $100,
have had as much and as good to
eat and wear as any honest mani
coukl want, have never charged a
man interest, have donated several
hundmlred dollars to debtors who a
could not pay without suffering,
and are to-day worth more in
property than the Enterprise has (
ever earned outside of official pat
ronage.
As to being a carpet bagger from
lack of identification or birth, we
beg to remind the Enterprise that
we were born in 40 miles of this n
city, and that our ancestors on
both sides have lived in Louisiana
for three generations; that we b
have been elected by over 2-thirds *
of the white votes, and served in a
our State Legislature from a par
ish that touches this in 8 miles of a
this city; and that our father has P
beeatwice elected and served in b
our Stat. Senate from the same ad- Ic
jeang section of the State.
We ask the indulgemnce of our
reers for these permonal allusions, i
which we consider meeeseary to re
fte the enjust ad unwarranted
attacks o the Enterprise, and to
pore that the only real objee
tioof that-paper is to our poi- P1
tis which it cannot dispute.
With a poorly aonealred ofeint
it plur::l object-,, the El:lter'i)is
first attacked our associate, Mr.
r Kearney, and ,got ba.'k a dish of
sour grapes ; then it assailed us in
Sthe same way, and we return the
fire in the same spirit, but we hope
with more consistency.
It reproaches its own people for
heeding such mongrels as it des
cribes us to be. They have cor
tainly been terribly abused by for
l uer leaders, or they woulldn't.
11ow Goldbuginm Kills Democ
racky.
t The ('olfax ('hronicle is branring
' because a little D)ermocratic parish
: convention recently nmet in that
a parish and adopted a goldllug res
olution and placed Cleveland on
t the same plano with .Jack.on. \We
do not see where the Chronicle's
ahilarity conies in. The l)Democrats
in that parish are as scarce as dol
lars in the pocket of the average
working man. The Populists have
the parish by a Iiz majority, and
the Chronicle's goldbug policy is
indirectly the cause.
If the Town Talk had advocated
such an undemnooratic mleasure as
the single gold standard, undoubt
edly Rapides parish would have
had 2300 white Populists instead of
that many good Dl)emocrats and no
Populists to amount to anything.
A few years ago Grant was a l).ni
ocratic p)arish.-Town Talk.
Well, if goldbugism kills De
mocracy, then the Democratic par
ty ought to (lie in this State, and
we believe it will.
While the Colfax Chronicle has
killed its party at home, it has
(lone so honestly, by defending its
party and the measures its party
advocates, while the Town Talk
has held the party together only
loosely in its parish by hypocriti
cally advocating Populist doctrines
which it knows will never be ta
ken ulp by the Democratic party,
as now controlled.
In the third column from where
we found the above in the Town
Talk, we saw a goldbug ticket
which the Town Talk is now sup
porting, but which it assured the
23(00 voters would be boaten be
fore said voters would vote in its
primaries.
Said goldhug ticket is the same
that the Chronicle's goldbug reso
lutions indorsed, and Town Talk,
if it had any political sense, must
have known when it was fooling
those 2300 voters into its prima
ries, that said goldbug ticket would I
be nominated, and that it would
then try to persuade them to vote
said ticket.
This proves that Town Talk is
not only a hypocrite, but it is do
ing much better service for the ]
goldbug cause than is the Colfax
Chronicle, because it hold hundreds a
of men to the support of the gold
bu2 ticket who could not be in- J
fluenced, by a known enemy. a
Of the two, we prefer such ene
mies as the Chronicle.
But we will soon have a Popu
list paper in Alexandria that will
take up this silver, and all other
Populist issues and push them to
sauccessful issue. i
This paper will soon show those a
23(0 voters where the Town Talk j
is leading them to, and they will n
do just what the intelligent white
people of Grant have done--join ti
a free silver party. N
Town Talk is simply doing the fi
goldbug's dirty work, while the ci
Chronicle does the bossing part. cl
