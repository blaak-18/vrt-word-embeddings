st TO THE PEOPLE'S PARTY OF
LOUISIANA.
in
New Orleans, La., April 15.-I
.h have stood loyal to your conven
D tion which nominated me, and I
,y relieve firmly in the principles
, enunciated in the platform adopt
ed by it. I have at more personal
. sacrifice than is justified by the
ir circumstances resisted the revolu
rs tionary course of the State com
_. mittee under Mr. Brian, and I do
ke not feel justified in being now
,r placed in a false position by con
tinumg a hopeless fight, after I
ie had vindicated as best I could our
party organization. It is now ap
.- parent that the contest for the of
fice of governor is between Cap
t, tun J. N. Pharr and Governor
n Murphy J. Foster, and that my
a, candidacy only complicates matters
- in this State. All your other can
r didates on the State ticket have
e adviseI me to withdraw. In Web
d ster parish the courts decided that
-the ticket headed by me is entitled
to representation ; in Orleans par
.ish with its two hundred and sixty
a thousand people they decided
- against me. It is plain for you
a to see that if 1 persist in claiming
II your votes as your nominee while
we have no campaign fund to push
a our ticket all over the State, that
we are affording a cloak to those
who would manipulate a fraudu
i lent election. We certainly have
not forgotten our treatment in the
Fourth and Fifth districts in the
last Congressional election. I feel
Sthat under existing conditions my
continued candidacy will place both
you and me in a false position, and,
,therefore, I deem it my duty to
you as well as to myself to with
draw, and thus leave you free to
unite upon one ticket, in' your ef
fort to secure an honest election in
Lounisiana.
In doinr this, I do it in the hope
that the day is not far distant when
we ma'y as a party not only put
forth our candidates, but do so
with some assurance' that we can
have an honest election in local,
.State and National affairs. I trust
that this may be the case in No
I vember, when I hope that under
the leadership of such men as en
ator Jones of Nevada, ad Senator
Tillman of South Carolina, we may
tsecunrs an expression of the people
Iof the United States'upa the great
'nanclal principles we advocate.

tratment we hope for; as ouron- 1

after, suh as will enable as to eo

claiining; that the I)e::ºnrti, ir
tf ty h n.I I,elu nIiisr ei...,ur I in th
matter of ofcering, Ithe P. 'c)-ll
mnission'ers to join it in -eculri-in a
white election.
The world- is already aware of
the fact that such an election was
held in this parish on Nov. 7th,
S1~!4, and again on the question
of prohibition in 1S9.5, and if we
renemlMwr correctly, the Demno
cratic party was in control of the
nlection machinery in this parish
r. at Ioth these ehlections.
Mr. Porter himself, in his very
lucid explanation of a part of the
transactions between the Demo
ceatic and People's parties on this
a, matter, says :
"It is a well known fact that
several lnmembers of the Democrat
ic Executive ('omminittee of this
parish at the neeting held on Feb
ruary 21st, desired to have the
cominnittee make a proposition sim
ilar to this one, as a sulstitue for
the one submitted by the Popu
lists for a white primary."
Of course "it is a well known
fact," and those "several mem
bers of the l)emocratic Executive
Comnmittee" gave full expression
to their desires in the presence of
the Populist suh-comnmittee. dele
t gated to submit the white iprimanry
ii prolposition, who, at that time, re
C fused it.
Those individual members may
not have had the authority of the
o whole Democratic Committee on
such a measure, neither did Mr.
H enry have such authority from
his committee, in proof of which
r he tried to get their signatures la
ter, and failed.
M. Ir. Porter's history of the mat
. ter is as good defense as the Pop
r ulists need in this case, and we
y thank him for his candor, and rest
, our cause. I
- Oh no ! we have no desire to c
e misrepresent the Democratic party. c
That is too big a job for us to un- I
,t dertake. It pccupies too many -
I positions upon the same question.
C
Another Objeet Lesson. t
The political demoralization of a
our young men is well nigh com- C
t plete, if those of them who fre- r
B quent country hotel lobbies and
there proclaim their fealty to Dem
t ocratic principles, by promising to z
stuff the ballot boxes in its inter
est, represent a fair average. a
These well dressed, cigarette
smoking, loud cursing dudes, are e
utterly and profoundly ignorant of P
those principles and policies which n
separate men into political organi- e
nations. Their whole knowledge V
of what they term the "princi
'ples of the Democratic party," d
eonsists in the right of that party o
to appoint all the commisseoners
and swindle at the election.
And the pretext for this, white o
supremacy, is not even ap'pealed I
to. When asked, as one was the
other evenag at Alexandria, La.,
by an intelligent travelling man,
"Would you use the machine, as to
you term it, if all the colored men a
were kept away by their leaders b
from the polls I" "It would make a
no diference in the count I" repli- a
ed the young citizen, with s oath,
too fool to print.
This rising young generation, L
with no conception of the duties h
of a citizen and indifferent to the
appalling conditions confronting
the great interests of a great State, oi
will, in a short time assume con- k
trol of our public afairs. The
lessons they have learned oft Dem- ,
oeraey; Jtrained as common elec
tion swmdlers; wilfully ignorant ti
of the demands of the houF, t w
them as promoters of a system of p
political debauchery which will be,
may, has beeome, a steach to the t
nostribs of honest men, at homet
aad abroadl.

us an assurance that any good will
come of this thing of "shreds and
patches" masquerading in its name
-even should it succeed.
Our young men, the future hope
of our commonwealth, are being
trained m the school of the theif
and the thug, and from the dark
conditions now surrounding us no
ray of hope for the future can lw
seen.
When the over-sensitive parti
zan points to the negroes assem
bled around the political hustings 
and sounds the danger call from
negro domination, let him be pres
ented with the other and more ap
palling picture-the youth and
manhood of the Caucasian race
eagerly learning the craft of the
vilest criminal.

dition will reduce, with unerring
certainty, the future political
struggle in Louisiana to a contest
