A HOME BY THE SEA.
"Oh! give me a home by the sea,
Where the wild waves are crested with
loam."
Was the song that I sang so Joyously,
- In the light of my childhool home.
For the mountains were shutting us in,
And the hills were on every side,
A.d we oould not see where the days begin.
Nor be sure If the world be wide.
But I smiled to my mother'ssmile,
And I laughed at my sister's words.
And the rippling brook 1 could hear, the while,
And the note of the summer birds.
As I sang the song that was sweet to me:
"Oh, give me a home by the heaving sea!"
"Oh I give me a home by the sea.
Where the wild waves are crested with
foam."
Was the song that I sang all merrily,
As I went from my mountain home.
Did I think of the wild bird's song?
Did I think of the sunset's hue?
Did I think of the hearts that had loved me
long,
As I bade them a joyous adieu?
Did I look at the pictured bills.
And the emerald vales between?
Did I dream of the faithful love that fills
All the years that intervene?
Yes, but I longed away to be
Over the hills and beside the sea
"Oh! give me a home by the sea!"
Do I sing the song to-night.
When the waves are echoing close to me.
And the billows are full in sight?
I can see the white-winged ships
That backward and forward go.
But my longing memory backward slips
To the place where the pine trees grow.
I can see the wild waves' foam,
But I whispered all the while:
"Oh. for a sight of the mountain home,
And the light of my sister's smile:"
And 1 long for the days that used to be.
And sing no more of tie fo.ming seaL
"Oh! give me a home by the sea:"
Let me sing it aga;tu to-day.
A home-I know not where it will be,
Nor how I shall tint the way.
But I know that a sea is there;
And I know there's a sea between:
And I know that the banks are forever fair;
And I know that the trees are green.
I am glad that the hills arise.
In the country where I shall go,
That a valley of peace besid3 them lies
And a river runs below.
The hands of my owv., they are reaching for
me
Oh. give me a home by the crystal sea!

SMr. Vernon-No,
I came back last night. And you? You
are back sooner than you intended?
Lord Linkshire-Yes, I only ran up
for this sale. I return to-night.
Mr. Vernon (suspiciously)-There is
unathing very particular here-nothing
in your line. that is?
Lord Linkshire-No. there is nothing
Blyzantine, but there is a rather out
of-the-way aureus. I want you to look
at it.
Mr. Vernon-An aureus?
Lord finkshire-Yes, a lovely little
piece; in the highest condition, too.

Mr. Vernon-Not the 'Plotina, Jack.
Don't say you've come to buy that!
Lord Linkshire-Yes, that's it, the
Plotina. (Looking up.) Scott, man!
"I ONLY RAN l-P FOR TIlS HALE,."
You don't mean to say that you came
for it, too?
Mr. Veitnon (resignedly)-Yes, I cavne
on purpose for it, too. VYell, I suppose
I must retire, as usual. I cannot com

Lord Linkshirc--Oh. nonsense, you
have as much right as I.
Mr. Vernon--But not as much money.
Lord Linkshire-Rtot! Toss you who

MrI. Vernon--Why do you want it?
Yo.s don't even collect imperials.

very enthusiasic about collecting just

3Mr. Vernon-Yes, it was I who first
started her.
Lord Linkishire (meditatively)-- True,
that does give you a sort of claim. On
the other hand, it follows that it is
en.irely through you that I am here.
MLr. Vernon-Why ever did you
comne? If only you had written and
commissioned some one you would have
got the coin and this would never have
happened.

how curious that it should be the sport
of fate that we two should always be
rivals for what is best and most
beautiful. First Helena HIarries; now
tbe Plotina.
Lord Linkshire (in a burst of gener
osilty)---Vernon, I have lHelena; you
shall have the Plotina.
Mr. Vernon--No, Jack, it must not
be. I cannot allow such a sacrifice.
And if I deprived flelenat of it I could
never meet her again. But wh:e I

know how nobly you have behaved.
IMr. Vernon- That's enough; we are
both acting for her happiness alone.
Come on; he's going to begin.
(They take seatsat the baize-covered
table: the auctioneer mounts his ros

Auctioneer-Lot 18. Here, gentle
men, we have a brilliant and exceed
ingly rare gold piece of Plotina. Kind

say? Twelve, ten, eight pounds?
Mr. Wilkins-Five.
Lord Linkshire-C uineas.

Going at twenty; no ardvance? (Ifringt

Auctioneer -- Twenty pounds was
Lord Linkshire's bid. I particularly
looked at you, but you never spoke.
DMr. WVilkins-Of course not. I tun
derstood that you had taken the
twenty pounds as mine. I certainly
said it.
Auctioneer - Very well. Did any
gentleman hear DMr. WVilliuns' twenty:
If so, he has the privilege of continn.

Lord Linkshire (after a moment*'
pause)--Yes, 1 did--confound it! -
nodded and thought that you took

Mr. Wilkins-A hundred.
Mr. Vernon (sotto voce)-This is sinm
ply madness. Let him buy it, and if
you must have it give him his twenty
per cent. on it afterwards.
Auctioneer (looking at Lord Link
shire)--One hundred pounds. Any ad
vance?
(lord Linkshire shakes his head and
the hammer falls. The sale continues
somuewh at tlat after this. Afterwards)
Mr. \Wilkins-I am much obliged to
your lordship. It was quite a mistake,
for, as you know. I certainly did bid,
and I particularly wanted the coin.
Lord ILinkshire -So do I. I want diet
to complete a series, and I thought that
perhaps you could sell it to me.
dIr. Wilkins-I'mn very sorry to dis
appoint your lordship, but we had a
commission, and. curiously enough,
our client mentioned that it was to
complete a series, also.
Lord Linkshire-And wanted to comn
plete it pretty badly, I should say,
judging from the latitude you had.
nlr. Wilkins-Well. it was consider
ably above our own estimate, but it
was an open commission, and your
lordship's judgment in these matters is
so good that we couldn't be going far
wrong in following your lead.
Lord Linkshirc (hopefully)-Per
Ihaps. after all, your client might pre
far to sell on hearing the price. Are
you at liberty to give me his name?
tlr. Wlillkins-Certainly, Lord Link
shire: there could be no objection to
that, but it isn't a "hc''e" at all. The
purchaser is a lady.

PRISONERS OF WAR.
A Cenlmtury Aga Tlhese tnL:ifortrnates Were
I:rtntally Treatted.
Little more than a century ago pris
oners of war were trcated with sys
tematic brutality. That gave John
Hloward his first task. l'rovidence
made him a suffercr in his own per
son, and thus painted out time special
fichl in which his philanthropic im
pulses were to find employment.
Hloward's pity was roused by the tales
of wretchedness lie heard from Lisbon
after thle great earthquake. lie took
passage on the Hanover brig, with the
intention simply of helping those un
fortunuates. ]lut the lianorer was
captured by a privateer, which carried
its prizes into lirest. Forty
hours the crew, with lloward,
lay in the bare and stilling
hold. A biscuit each was thrown to
t hemt before the hatches w-ere closed,
but ino drop of water did they receive.
On arrival at l:rest no one heeded thetir
cries. They were thrust into a dnn
gLeon inldergrounid, damp aanl fillthy
beyond description, andi "several
hours" passed before the goalers
Ibrought food or drink. Opening the
door then, they actually "pitched" a
leg of mutton among the throng, to be
scranmbled for, and torn to pieces with
the teeth.
Six weeks Howard remained in this
fearful place with the sailors-men of
cance, be it observed, following their
lawful business, but in timne of ewar.
Relieved then on parole, lie applied
himself to ransomu his fellow-sufferers,
and afterward traveled to other forts
and stations where Englishmen we-re
confined. It seems impossible that
any of thcnm could have been more hor
rible than l:rest, but Hloward found
such; at Dinan, for examnple, iwhere
thirty-six poor wretches were buried
in one day. Returning home. he in
vestigated the English ar-rangemments
for prisoners of tn:mr, and found themn
not less lhorrible. It is well to reccol
lect that when hloward appealed to tihe
royal commnnissioners for tine sick and
womunded,l sendling in a detailed report,
without at mocment's delay orders were
issued to correct thie abuse. Aloreover,
thie commnissioners transmitted his
statemnent to F-rance, and the F'rench
governulent was not less plromnlpt in
acting uipon it. luit for how mmany
generations h:td that a\wful state of
tlings continued.--London Standa,-d.

C.'TCHING LIVELY BURGALLS.
They Are P'at Very Uig. but Will Furnisl
Lots of Amsemsent.
Tlhe burgalls, or canners. a.the Coan
necticut fla)iermnen call them, are emn
monly considered a nuisance. Tlie.;;
steal the bait from the books of bass
and black fish anglers, and,fome claim.
drive away the larger fish. But of
late certain knowing anglers have dis
covered t hat, properly handled, the
burgalls will furnish great fuLn. They
are a plump, active little fish, seldom
attaining a weigfht of more than a
pound and a half, and averaging about
half a pound. Their coloring is very
beautiful, showing in different lights
adl the rainbow tints. They are gre
garious, and where one bites you may
know that a whole shoal is feeding.
Rocky bottom, with plenty of rock
weed and sea moss growth. is their
natural habitat, and they feed greedi
ly on hard or soft clams, crab meat,
bits of shiner and killic, cut up, and
sand worms.
Of course, a heavy tackle destroys
all the pleasure of catching these
plucky little flsh. You want a light
trout rod, a fine silk line, and snelled
sporat hooks, size No. 4 or 5, about
the size used to take mnountain brook
trout. A split buckshot will be a
heavy enough sinker to answer eery
purpose. Bait as carelessly as you
may, you will not alarm or disgust the
burigall. lie is a fish of no epicurean
taste., and quantity standls before
quality in his eyes. I'ut a bit of bait
on just large enough to cover the bend
of the hook, and let one end hang off
to tempt the rascals. Fish from a boat,
or from a ledge of rocks, or from a
pier, and select a spot where the tide
ldoes not set too sharply, for these fel
lows are too lazy to battle with very
strong tides.
Soon a quick mincing nibble will an
nounce the first arrived guest. and a
.sharp, strong pull is necessary to hook
hima. These fish have hard, tough
jaws andi lips, and gentle pulls will
never strike the barb home. Some
times the bigger ones, by running un
der a strongly-rooted clump of rock
rweed or sea kale, or under a bowlder
on the bottom, will give you great
trouble. At no time wnill they surren
der without a very considerable tussle
for freedom.
Just before a storm in the very best
time to catch burgalls. When the sky
is black, and the heavy clouds hang
low over the water, and the sea gulls
sklim wildly over the bay, the sturdy
rockdwellers legin to revel. At such
a time, with two hooks on your line,
you can land two at a time until your,
artn aches frtm the effort. Tile dead.
low water antll rising tide are best for
e:tching bulrgalls, for, by the time the
ebb sets out. these little gluttons have
so s:rfeited themselves ont the flood
that they have no appetite left.
P They are easy t.o catch, and can be
found a1ll around New York harbor
and adjacent water. Barstow-on-the
sound is a convenient station on the
Lharlem river branch of the New Haven
ra ilroad, and there you can take a lit
tle bobtail car to City Island. Here
you catch burgalls unnumhered in
rocky l'elham bay and its many inlets.
So, too, you can along the Staten
island shore and on the Jersey side.
1',hlat is more, after you have had the
fuln of catching them there still re
mains no inconsiderable treat, for the
bnrga.ils. when fresh caught, are the
finest pan fish that swim. The man
who can not put:ttleast three of them.,
crisp ant lint., under his vest at break
fast has fa iled prope. ly to appreciate
his opportnnitics.-N. Y. Journal.
WATER POWER.
Amnericran andl Emuropeat mlethods of Using
It ini a Large Way.
'lhec standard American nmethod of
utilizing a large amount of water pow
er lhas hitherto been to distribute the
water to tile several consumers or mill
owners by means of a system of head
races, so culled, with facilities for its
discharge at a lower level, to be util
ized as the owner or lessee sew fit, and
generally on his own premires. This
ledt to long head canals, and to insis
niileant tail-races, whereas tile .Ninagara
plant consists of a common tail-:aaee, a
umile and a half long,with comparative
ly insiginificant head-races. Ti'e old
tiie watLer power company soll or
leased the right to draw a definite
quantity of water at defined times,
with the privilege of discharging it at
a lower level, sad the mill owner did
the rest; whereas at Niagara falls the
right i. leased to discharge a definite
qutantit of water into the tail-race
tunnel, with the privilege of drawing
this qiuantity from the head canal, or
froin the river. Biut over and above
this the produet--power-mtnay be con
tracted for at Niagara falls, delivered
on the shihaft.
To creacte a large group of mill sites
of the oler sort tlhere was necessary,
in the first instnnce, a. large, continu
ous otody of land, properly located for
tihe purpose. If this cohld not be
iougnlit tip seecetly, anti in large blocks,
the whole v:ttecr-powr'r ncuterprise
would fall to come to frnition. In Eu
rope, lhowecver, several such enterprises
caine into being in spite of tile in
-ability of the projectors to primarily
buy tracts of land such as have been
descrihcd. TI:is was done by estab
lishing central power stations near the
dami, or head canal, anti timei trans
omitting thIe power produced, insteadt
of time water to produce it, to tile con
suriters or meill owners. U'p to within,
say, livc years, this had always been
acicotnplishled by means of wire-rope
tr:ansnissions of power, and it is easy
to see thlat the invention of the elec
trical transmissiou of power would give
th:s fornm of thIe utilization of a large
water power a gIre;at itmpetus. lMany
such plants are, therefore, already in
existence, many are building, but
among tlhem all no one is probably so
celebrated anld is attracting the atten
tion of atll intelligent mecn as this at
Niagtara fa4lls. -C'assier's Magazine.
