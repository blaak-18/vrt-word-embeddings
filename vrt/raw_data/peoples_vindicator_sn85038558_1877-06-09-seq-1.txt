a winter, George and I were trapping oI
on a bran h of the Reipublican Riverl. ki
The Iidians xwere pi ettV iiu-bh friend- Ii

for there to be browsing around miuiih si
anthowt, so we flit cozy as Plie in a d
little d1ug-lout we'd made int, the side le
of the bluff. One day while George ti
and I were skylarking on the ice I at
ftell and broke uny leg, oi ratherlii I di
splintered the shin bone. That sort
of thing isn't the II leasantest in thel
world, even if you are at a post
where thenes a doctor to look cot ton T

very rough, almost worse than I did, li
and lie just hustled airounid me ai re

so had wanidereti away some line
before, for there George piled our
blankets and eljts tlrgethi, and laid ('
me on them, and then ihe took a prll o'
at his belt, picked up his nitle arid a
started onta-foot. To say I felt lone- te
lv wouldn't express it, but you see
1 knew lie ought to be back in twelve

THlE DAYS TURNED INTO WEEKS.
But 3otl see a mntii hates to (lie like a P1
