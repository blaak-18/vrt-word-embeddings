Hon. A. Benoit.
The prohlahitities now are that
Mr. lh.noit, Populist will he seat
(ed as the member of Congress L(
from this (the 5th) district, vice C. of
J. Boatner, democrat. That Mr. an
Benoit will prove himself a worthy dr
representative of 'is people we
have only to reiterate what the of
, New York Sun has to say of the fo
0 Populist mnlebers of Congress. re
"So much for the Populist mem
-hers. There is not an idle man
among them. They are always in yc
- their seats ani. their names are th
T found recorded upon nearly every be
R roll call. They are not obstruc- in
i, tionist or cranks, but men who
h seem to have become convinced re
. that the welfare of the nation re- pi
quires the service of a new politi- of
e al party to meet the emergency. re
a That it has found many hearers of
- was shown by their wonderful con- nt
vention in Omaha in 1S92, in their
e casting over a million votes and re
e gettilng over twenty electoral votes th
0 in their first campaign, a new step el
in'a n:,tional election. No one in
the Populist party need be asham- e(
e ed, but instead can be proud of t
a their representatives in Congress." m
f There are attempts being made 6(
g by men (some of whom are in tl.e P'
pay of the go!d gamblers) to side o
track the People's tarty on some la
e comparatively unimportant issue.
Populists, don't he deceived by at
them. Stick to your. platform, hi
keep in the middle of the road, tc
- march right forward, and Satan tb
- himself shall not prevail against oi
f you. You'LL GIT THERE.-Farm- st

y OBITUARY. to
e The death of Mr. Marco Givan
D ovich some days ago, while not un
expected, proved a severe blow to
his many friends in this communi
ty.
Mr. Givanovich was a gentle S
and kindly man, a gentleman indeed, di
of the old school, and possessed of hi
a very large fortune, he was ena
bled to lend a helping hand to the P
r needy. There are many here who
have been the recipients of his s
generosity, and he was charitable f
to a fault. The deserving poor tl
have lost a trusty friend, and they is
deeply deplore his death. n
n The following is a graceful trib- tl
uate to therdecnased which appear- p
r ed in the Shreveport Times, and
we take pleasure in reproducing it, ti
e feeling that if will be gladly read P
Sby all of our readers :

leans, Sunday, February 16, 1896, b

d aged 7 3years. ti
The deceased was a native of Ro- v
guas, Austria, and for the past 54
rha been a resident of the
arsh of Natchitoches, of which '
t he was the wealthiest planter, his tl
fortune being estimatedat 1,000,- p
000. Only three days previous to I
" his death his oil mill at Natchito
in ches was destroyed by fire. Mr.

Attention Populists.
ni- - pr
There will be a meeting at Pace's co
tle School House, ward 4, on Thurs
, day, March 5th, at 12 o'clock. We u
of hope all Populists will attend, as q
ma- there will be business of great im- ch
the portance to the ward. ze
ho Our neighbor across the street,
his says that the Democratic party wl
ble favors free silver. On Feb. 24th, fri
or the National bankers had a meet- n'
key ing in New York at the Fifth Ave
nue Hotel. We give below what m
ib- the Times-Democrat said about the an
ar- proceedings:
md Secretary Carlisle, in a short
it, talk, said that he believed that both e
Ad political parties would adopt in
"sound currency" planks in their
platform; he was confident .
)r- that this course would be followed
96, by the Democrats. He said re
.h; ports from all sections showed that
the movement for "sound money" IN
Re- was gaining in popular favor.
4 Now we would lihke to know el
which is the highest authority upon am
his the platform of the Democratic S
),- party, Secretary Carlisle, or the
to Enterprise?
ito
r The Times-Demoerat does not a
seem to be working well in b rnese. D
adIt tells about Kellogg and Cage i
rad supporting Foster. It condemns b
!ew the action of the negroes in the
B Democratic primaries. And on
at Wedneeday, it tells about
Judge Watkmins, in Webster par- P
o. ish, askin the negroes to vote the o:
the Democratie ticket, because, saiud
Sthe Judge, "the Popolist had not ri
combined with them, but with thl(P
"Lilly Whitee," and they would not '*
put a colored man or old time Re
thi publican on their ticket, or on
Stheir committees."
Now neighbor, you say we com-a'
.- hined with the negro, who is right,
val- you, the Times-Demoorat, or Wat
|-
Don't forget that the Democrats C
m have refued a white primary,
and
tr. You must register if you want
sal- to vote, I(

State Platform
People's Party of Louisiana.
1. We affirm our allegiance to
the pure principles of popular nov
ernment, as enunciated by Wash
ington, Jefferson andt Jackson, andl
embodied in our National platform,
and we uphold the principle emu
lxxlied in the immortal declaration
that this should be "'a Government
of the people, by the people and
for the people."
2 Andi especially do we de
m and the free and unlimited coin
r ane of both gold and silver, at the
ratio of 1i to 1, with equal debt
paying power as primuary money,
and a full legal tender monetary
system for the people of the Unit
ed States, without consulting any
.1 foreign nation or money syndicate.
3. We demand for Louisiana w
t industries equal protection to that
0 atforde l the industries of other
States. AnAmerican, not a Brit- E
ish system of commercial laws,
° that no discrimination against our
s agricultural and industrial classes
may be made. P
4. We favor a just and liberal
t system of public schools for the
t ienefit of all classes of our peol)le,
C and we delplore the fact that for
many years the management of
our public school system has been
so defective that the party now in
Spower seeks to disfranchise a large
s number of our citizens on the
a grounds of ignorance.
r 5. We denounce the disgrace
ful and infamous election frauds
n which have prevailed in Louisiana,
and we demand and are determin- T
ed to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall cast his bal
lot freely and secretly, andt the
vote shall be fairly counted as they
Y are actually cast. This is the su
0 preme issue in this campaign, and
- in its success the honor, manhood
, and prosperity of Louisiana are
o involved. The foul and loathsome
' methods which have brought the
it ballot box stuffer to the front, and
° placed him in power in Louisiana,
u must, in the name of liberty, jus
tice, morality and common decen
cy, be suppressed.
6. We oppose and denounce the
proposed suffrage amendment, con
s cocted by political schemers, not to
- purify and elevate the ballot box
e but to subserve their selfish pur
i poses by providing contradictory
qualifications, to suddenly disfran
* chise large masses of worthy citi
zens, by deluding the people with
promises of changes m the next
t, Legislature. We denounce the
:y whole amendment as a vicious
h, fraud which proposes measures and
t- methods that are un-American and
destructive of free institutions.
e- 7. We favor the utmost econo
at my of expenditures, in State, city
i0 and parish, and pledge our candi
dates to a strict and impartial en
rt forcement of all laws, and the pres
th ervation and promotion of overy
interest in Louisiana, whose wel
Pt fare is bioader and more sacred
than party lines or partisan poli
, cies; and we invite and urge the
true men and honest citizens of I
at Louisiana, without regard to past
party affiliations to join with us in
a noble, patriotic and powerful ef
fort to relieve our people and to
aW elevate the standard of politics
a and public morality in our beloved
tic State.
