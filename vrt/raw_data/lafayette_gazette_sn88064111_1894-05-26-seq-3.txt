The Falk & Guchereau Brick.
Yard.
Monday eveting a representative
of this paper was driven to the
brick yard of Messrs. Falk&Guche
reau and was surprised to see the
large number of people busy mak
ing bricks. Many people may
not be aware of the fact that this
industry is and has been one of. the
most successful enterprises in
Latayette as well as one of the
most profitable. Its success can
be attributed to the strict business
way in which it is managed and to
the superior quality of bricks manu
factured. Mr. Guchereau, who
supervises the work, is a first-class
brick-maker of several years' ex
perience, both in this country and
in France and it is safe to say that
no brick is allowed to go out from
his manufacture without the stamp
of perfection. It is really surpris
ing to see with what rapidity dry
dirt is ground, passed through a
mould and pressed into a well
formed brick, ready to be put in
the kiln to be hardened or burnt.
8000ooo to soooo bricks are moulded
every day, and this with the help
of only twelve hands. The weight
of the bricks averages six and a
half pounld.
Mr, Falk mformed The Gazette
that he makes shipment almost
daily, to the adjoining parishes and
hat his trade is constantly increas
ing. In The nekt kiln which will
be burnt ia a few days, there are
xto,ooo bricks, a number of which
are already sold.

RATHER DIE
Than Give Up-Sheriff Broussard
and Deputy Mestayer Corn
pelled to Kill A Negro.
The killing of the negro, Henry
Jones, in Iberia parish last Sunday,
has rid society of a dangerous
character, well known in Lafayette.
It will be remembered that he made
a brutal assault upon Mr. B. Falk,
without any provocation, and when
Sheriff Broussard arrested him for
that offense he made a motion to
draw a weapon, but fortunately the
sheriff covered him with his pistol.
The crime which has cost him
his life was one of the blackest and
most revolting ever committed in
this part of the state and had he
been caught by the citizens of
Lake Charles it is almost certain
that he would have been lynched.
His victim, a little girl of a years,
of very respectable parents, was
taking an evening walk with her,
little brother, when the black brute
carried her away into tne woods
and there acomplished his purpose.
Knowing the country well he suc
ceeded to escape and avoided ar
rest up to last Sunday.
The facts were telegraphed to all
parts of the State. Our plucky
sheriff, Ike Broussard, knew the
ravisher and suspected" that he
would visit his old home here.
With his usual vim and persever
ance, the sheriff watched for his
man day and night and heard that
he had been in Lafayette, and had
left for parts unknown; but the
vigilant officer did not stop search
ing for his man, and soon located
him in Iberia parish, and in com
pany with Deputy H. Billaud, he
left for that parish, Saturday evening
taking with him his trusty winches
ter as he knew full well that Jones
would resist any attempt to bring
him to Lake Charles where certain
death awaited him.
When the sheriff and his deputy
reached New Iberia. they were
joined by Deputy Sheriff Mestayer.
The following account of the cap
ture of the criminal and his subse-.
quent killing is taken from the New
Iberia correspondent to the Times
Democrat of Monday:
Yesterday Sheriff Broussard obtained in
formation that Jones was in this vicinity,
and together with Deputy Mestayer located
him south of here, near D)avid's switch, on
the Iberia and Vermilion Railroad, a thinly
settled village in the edge of Pettie Anse
woods. The officers went there last night
and found the cabin where Jones had bcen
hiding vacant, and after waiting there
several hours a negro named Johnson came,
evidently to see if the coast was clear, and
upon seeing the officers attempted to run,
but was captured, and told the officers that
Jones was at a ball near by. They hastened
to the cabin where the hall was in progress
and saw Jones sitting at a table playing
cards with some women. Near him, and in
reach, was a double-barrel shot-gun that he
had taken with him. Deputy Mestayer,
whom Jones did not know, entered the room
and covering Jones with his pistol asked
him to surrender. The negro coolly denied
that he was Jones, but when Seeriff Brous
sard, whom he knew well, entered, the
negro grew desperate and attempted to get
his gun, when Mestayer closed in on him
and a fearful struggle took place, both
being powerful men. Finally Mestayer got
the negro outside of the cabin and the
struggle was renewed. The negro had the
revolver by the barrel, attempting to wrest
it from Mestayer, and just as he was success
ful Mestayer pulled the trigger. The ball
hit the negro's head, parted the hair in the
middle, but did not enter the skull. Brous
sard then seeing Mestayer's life in danger
shot the negro in the left breast with a
winchester rifle. Still the negro refused to
surrender, and said that he would either
die himself or kill them. He then at
tempted to get back into the cabin to his
gun, when both officers fired, and then
Jones fell with three balls in his breast and
died in a few minutes. His body was
brought to town and a post mortem ex
amination held by Coroner Burgess. The
coroner's jury, after hearing the evidence,
exonerated the officers.
tomorrow's Excursion.
The excursion to Thibodeaux to
morrow will no doubt be largely
attended from this place, the ar
rangement committee are however
prepared tor as many as wish to
attend, and assutire all that a suffi
cient number of coaches will be

be taken in train when needed.

Carencro News.
From Out ltegularCorrespodent
-The "Sugar Planters' Associa
tion' met at the Alliance Hall last
Sunday to hear the report of the
committee consisting of Messrs. C.
C. Brown, V. E. Dupuis, and O. C.
Mouton, who had just returned from
New Orleans whenece they had gone
to make certain arrangements, and
solicit bids for the erection of the
sugar refiney here. Mr. O. C. Mou
ton speaking for the committee de
clared that while everything else was
entirely satisfactory, it would be an
impossibility to complete the plant
in time to "take off" the coming
crop. This conclusion was reluc
tantly reached after the committee
had consulted with 'a number of
machinery agents and sugar factors.
Mr. Mouton related the several in
terviews had with these gentlemen,
and made everything clear to his
listeners, which comprised nearly
all of the cane planters of Carencro,
Mouton Switch and Sun Set. Instead
of becoming discouraged they grace
fully accepted the inevitable, and
determined to increase their mem
bership, and stand together with the
sole object in view of carrying out
the original plan next January. A
large number of gentlemen of Sun
Set have contributed liberally, and
will really be among the most im
portant stock-holders of the concern.
The Sugar Planters' Association has
effected a permanent organization.
The next regular meeting will be
held in Carencro on Nov. x5 and
during the interim will be subject
to the call of the president. Your
correspondent being thoroughly
conversant with the workings of the
association and being in a position
to know what he is writing about,
wishes it distinctly understood that
this is not a failure, but merely a
necessary postponement of a positive
plan, that will be worked to a suc
cessful conclusion next winter, in
proper time to grind the crop of x895.
-There is to be an excursion
from Thibodeaux to Care~cro on
June 24 and it behooves our people
to make arrangements to give the
excursionists as pleasant a reception
as possible. The selection of Caren
cro is a compliment to our people
which we have no doubt will be fully
appreciated. More anon.
-Mr. A. C. Guilbeau has re
ceived a complete new cotton gin
outfit, consisting of powerful machi
nery, and self packing cotton press.
We congratulate Mr. Guilbeau on
his enterprise, and wish him every
success.
-Mr. J. R. Jones, receiver of
the Teche Railroad, passed through
town last Sunday, and your corres
pondent availed himself of the op
portunity to question him as to
when the road would be completed
to Breaux Bridge. Mr. Jones
declared that a force of men would
start to word within two weeks to
finish the road between Grand Point
and Breaux Bridge, but how long it
would take to complete the work
he could not say.
-Dr. Guilbeau of Breaux Bridge
was in town last Sunday.
-The Sugar Planters' Association
intend to get all the subscribtions
for stock that they possibly can, so
that they will be enabled to put up
a 6oo ton refinery instead of 4oo as
originally intended.
-Totidem Verbis salutes Bro.

and which by harmony of action,
and exercise of energy it Is bound
to acquire.
-A contributor to the "Adver

with success.

From Our Regular Correspondeht.
-The majority of the votetrs of
this parish favor a repeal of the
Sunday Law. That law, by its un
popularity has been openly and
publicley violated from the very
beginning. The time has arrived
when the Sunday law should be
made. null and void; seven-eights of :
the. people of the state are in direct
opposition to it; and further more, i
no jury could be found that would
convict a violator of the Sunday
law. It is to be hoped that the
I.egislature will act accordingly,
and save the fair name of Louisiana
from further ciommn.:t and disres- ;

the New Orleans administration,
contracted too large a bargain with

street last Monday, plainly indicates
that the people of New Orleans will
not allow a few corrupt capitalists
to depredate and rob them at will.
-Edward G. Voorhies, Esq., of

-Hon. H. Theall and wife, are

-Mrs. Don Caffery, Jr., of Frank

-Mr. P. B. Landry visited La

-Odilon Blanchet with "ye

-The Royville sports returned
from the races Sunday, "dry, dusty
and defeated."
-Your correspondent was in
formed that three miles South of
Royville not a drop of rain has
fallen for a month or two. The
soil is very dry, and the crops are
badly in need of water.
-Women, in the last fifteen years
have certainly made gigantic strifes
toward the advancement, enlight
ment and protection of their sex.
We remember the day, not very
far off, when a womani studying
medicine, with intention of prac
ticing that profession, was looked
upon with amazement and surprise
by the sterner sex, abundantly en
dowed with any amount of nerve,
not to say audacity. At this day,
wometh are not only doctors, but
they may be heard or seen in the
field as lawyers; specialists- poli
ticians and even ministers. Behold!
the time is rapidly approaching
when men, we candidly believe,
will be forced to retire, and begin
life over again in the drudgeries of
the household. It might seem strange
that we should express ourselves in
this strain, but can we believe
otherwise? Have we not demon
strations daily before us? From a
political point of view, women have
proved themself equal to the oc
casion. They have ambition, en
ergy and perseverance, and with
such noble qualities, we cannot
but predict a bright future for the
fair sex. CHEROKEE.
Non-Sectarian Bill.
Baton Rouge Correspondent N. O. States.
If Mr. Mouton, of Lafayette
pushes the bill which he has in
troduced with reference to paro
chial schools, and he tells me he
will urge it with all the energy of
which he is capable, that measure
will attract not a small measure of
public atlenticn. If the Bill passes
it will forestall any effort that
might be made in the future to have
part of the public founds appro
priated to the maintenance of the
schools of a religious character in
Louisiana.
The bill was introduced yester
day and is brief but emphatic in the
provisions. It prohibits school
boards of the State from combining
the public schools with any private
or other institution of learning
under the control or management
of any church or religious order of
any sect or denomination, and to
prohibit them from employing, as
professors or teachers in the public
schools, any preacher, priest or
other minister of religion, while in
the actual service of any church or
religious order as a teacher or min
ister of religion. The title of the
bill is quoted above, and its pro
visions are fully set forth in the
title. The bill will come up to-day
on second reading for reference to
committee.
Mr. Mouton is a Catholic, but to
those who are familiar with the re
ligious questions of the day it will
be evident that the act has special
reference to the faith of which the
Lafayette representative is a com
municant. In other states and
cities, and notably in Pittsburg,
there have been controversies dis
cussed at length in the public prints
growing out of the appropriation of
funds for the maintenance of re
ligious schools and the employment
of teachers wearing the habit of
some religious order. The famous
Fairbault plan of Archbishop
Ireland grew out of an arrangement
between the lay authorities whereby
a relation was established beteen
the public and parochial schools.
Mr. Mouton's act is intended not
only to abrogate alleged similar ar
rangements in certain parishes in
this State, but to prevent any such
arrangements in the future.
Mr. Mouton's people have beedi
Catholics for a century but he says
they have always been liberal
minded and that he believes the en
actment of his bill into a law would
have a tendency to maintain peace
betweetl church and state, Mr.
Mouton is or was the president of
the school board of Lafayette, anti
in three years established a large
number of excellent schools in his
parish. He wants these schoolS
operated with absolute freedom
from religious interference. The
bill is a rather bold one and is not
likely to provoke considerable dis
cussion upon the floor of the lIuuse
when it cotnes back from the com
mittee and is ready for enrollment
and passage to third reading.
Mr, Mouton's bill has been re
ported favorably hy the -coirmittee
