Public Opinion Throughout the Union
GEORGIA’S STIGMA.
The report of the Georgia special
legislative committee to which was re
ferred the investigation of the State
convict leasje (system, whitewashing
the present commissioners and giving
the system a further three-years lease
of life, is not only discouraging but
is postively discreditable to the
sentiments of the people of a great
State. The developments following
the inquiry were revolting, scanda
lous and thoroughly disgusting. Now
one single fragment of favoring testi
mony was adduced during the hear
ing, but everything from the smallest
detail condemned the system —that is
as an institution maintained by a sup
posedly civilized, humane and Chris
tian community.—Chattanooga Times.
MAKE DISEASE A CRIME.
Last summer we heard a public
speaker state that the time would
soon come when disease would be a
disgrace. He argued that there is a
local condition for almost every dis
ease, and that with the proper pre
caution there is no necessity for any
one to be sick.
This is literally true of two of the
prevailing diseases. Malarial fever
is caused by mosquitoes, which can
be barred out with wire screens, and
typhoid fever, which is always the
result of bad water or flies.
In discussing the cause of typhoid
fever, the Louisville Courier-Journal
says:
“Typhoid fever has its harvest in
the summer and autumn, because the
infection is taken into the system
through the mouth, food or drinking
water, as a rule. It is called a pre
ventable disease. It is not always
possible to trace a case of typhoid
fever to its origin with postive ac
curacy. House flies may bring the
germ from an infected source, and
the disease may appear where the
water supply is pure, but the great
er number of cases of fever result
from carelessly swallowing the germs
of typhoid fever. Guarding against
infection is a reasonably certain de
fense, and is not unreasonably diffi
cult. Typhoid fever is not fatal in
a large percentage of cases as it for
merly was. Good nursing, which is
as essential as good ‘ doctoring,’ of
ten results in a cure.”
If the people will keep their water
supply pure and prevent the fly
from contaminating it, there is no
reason why there should be a case of
typhoid fever.
So many times has it been proved
that mosquitoes alone produce ma
larial fever that when a case de
velops it is known postively that
nothing has been done to keep little
pests from getting in their work.
This is not a theory, but a well es
tablished fact. It has been shown
conclusively that mosquitoes are not
one cause of malaria, but the only
cause. Bar them out and malarial
fever in your family will cease.
As troublesome as is malarial fever,
however, one case of typhoid is worse
than a whole season of malaria. In
this section there is comparatively
little typhoid. Dublin is singularly
free from this disease. In the middle
and north Georgia counties there is
a great deal of typhoid, and in other
sections where the water supply is
bad. Wells should be drawn off fre
quently and all surface water pre
vented from contaminating the drink
ing supply. When this is done and
the pesky fly is kept away from milk
and the food supply, there is little
danger from typhoid.
The time is coming when it will
be a disgrace to be sick, for the rea
son that it will then be shown that
almost every ailment is the result of
criminal carelessness. —Dublin Cou
rier-Dispatch.
FAIR PLAY.
It is a poor rule that don’t work
both ways. If a farmer puts a rock in
a bale of cotton he is looked upon
and punished as a thief —but if he
buys a pair of shoes the soles of
which are mostly paper, the man that
made them and the man that sold
them go free although they are the
the meanest kind of dirty thieves.
If the merchant buy from a farmer’s
wife a dozen eggs and finds a couple
that are out of date, he orders his
clerks not to buy eggs again from
her while for those very eggs he had
given her sand in her sugar, chicory
for her coffee, short weight soap and
calico warranted not to fade that
was only fit for mosquito bars after
being washed. The farmer has never
been allowed to price anything, weigh
anything or measure anything but
must take the price, weight and meas
ure of the merchant for everything he
sells or buys and it is about time he
was claiming his rights and attending
to his own business. I am out to
help the farmer get fair play and if
he will aid me by joining the union
and taking my advice, he will get fair
play. Take, for instance, two pair
of scales, exactly alike and made by
the same man. Now is there any rea
son why they should differ one ounce 1 ?
Put one pair on a platform in town
and the other at a gin house in the
country, and the town scales, will short
weight his country brother from five
to twenty pounds. Get together,
brethren, and put an end to all this
and get at it now. —Miss. Union Ad
vocate.
THE LAST GUEST.
Col. Ward well died on Saturday in
Arizona, his last thought for his wife,
a leper. She lies strapped to a bed
in an adjoining room. For her, too,
the end of the toilsome road is near.
No disease is so dreadful as lep
rosy. Sickness etherealizes and death
confers its seal of sublime majesty.
Alone the scarred and maimed leper
remains an object of horror. The love
which conquers death in such a form
outweighs any of the “grand pas
sions” of which poets sing. Given
but a modicum of courage, and death
for beauty’s sake is easy. Death for
beauty destroyed beyond all hope of
remembrance calls for love almost su-

peril uman. And such love Col. Ward
well had displayed. Prudence dictated
and the law sought to compel the
abandonment of her whom he had
promised to protect “in sickness and
in health.” 'But the war-worn veter
an found a higher law. Taking her
with him he fled the state which would
have compelled their separation. The
gallant soldier, now surrendered to
the mighty enemy, conquered, yet the
victor.
Sociologists are bewailing the weak
ening of domestic ties, the courts are
choked with suits of divorce and press
and pulpit deplore the levity with
which marriage is now regarded. The
story of Col. Wardwell shows that
even in these prosaic days love en
dures. One of Gibson’s drawingspor
trays an old couple seated at a din
ing table. Empty chairs give evi
dence of the departed guests. Her
head rests upon his shoulder, while
love invisible to both drains a toast
to the days that were. For Col.
Ward well and his wife love too has
remained ‘ 1 the last guest. ’ ’ —N. Y.

WHAT BETTER POSTAL SERVICE
WOULD MEAN.
The establishment, of the postal
savings bank in this country would
afford the working man or woman the
opportunity to accumulate by degrees
sufficient money to buy a home or
become a property owner in a small
way, and this is universally admitted
to be the start toward good citizen
ship. But the other measures included
in the proposed reform, namely:—the
extension of the parcel post system at
more reasonable rates and the installa
tion of a parcel-post on the rural
routes, would be almost as far-reach
ing in their effect, for the reason that,
if carried out as suggested, they would
inevitably favor the the establishment
of small shops in villages and towns,
afford an icentive to shop keepers
already in business to improve and
increase their stock and give to the
fanners a service as adequate as could
be obtained in the city. This exten
sion of the postal service is no newer
than the question of postal savings
banks, nor is its desirability less
assured. As the matter stands now,
the United States is far behind other
countries in the matter of postal
service does not now fill more than a
more limited service than obtained in
any other of the thirty-three countries
with which we have postal conven
tions, with the result that the express
companies reap a rich harvest while
this important branch of the public
service does not no fill more than a
fraction of the field intended for it.
In this country everything that ex
ceeds the weight limit of four pounds
must be sent by express and even
within the limit it is cheaper to send
a package by express than by mail at
sixteen cents a pound. In twenty
four foreign countries with which we
have postal conventions the weight
limit is eleven pounds and the postage
in all but four cases is twelve cents
per pound, so that it is actually
cheaper to send a package abroad by
mail than it is to send it from one
pbint to another within the limits of
the United States.—From “More
Efficient Postal Service” in the Sep
tember Craftsman.'
BRYAN AND WALL STREET.
Democrats under the guise of Pop
ulists have control of the regular pop
ulist organization in Nebraska and
have placed the Democratic electors
on a ticket which they call Populist.
In no other state is there fushion on
President. Mr. Bryan lost Nebraska
in 1900 and with his backsliding on
the money and railroad questions and
with the Wall street platform ad
opted at Denver it is hardly probable
that as many Nebraska Populists will
vote for him this year, as did in 1900.
His own party is far in the minority
in Nebraska. Roosevelt carried that
state in 1904 by over 2 to 1, the vote
being Roosevelt 138,558, Parker 51,-
876. Bryan campaigned the state in
favor of Parker, got as many populists
to vote for him as he possibly could.
Now that Bryan is standing on a
platform that is even more suitable to
Wall street than was the Parker plat
form it is quite likely that most of
these Populists who wouldn’t follow
his advice to vote for Parker will
not vote for Bryan this year. Mr.
Bryan’s chances, if he has any, are
not in the West. The money power
can turn New York, Indiana and New
Jersey to him and may do so. The
New York delegation, which was
under the absolute control of the
Wall street element of the party,
voted for Bryan’s nomination, and it
is not improbable that Wall street
sees it to its interest to give De
mocracy ia term of office in order to
keep the old party alive. For should
the Democratic party disband, the Re
publican party would be whipped in
the very first battle thereafter —Mis-

Speaking of some of the more sol
emn and awful features of rural life,
President Roosevelt remarks:
All of us know that certain type of
the best room in the farmhouse, the
one that is kept so carefully that you
could not hire the husband or the
servant to go into it. Isn’t it true?
Sure! Open it up!—Boston Herald.
