Legislative Retrenchment.
No man, however bitterly he may the
have assailed the legislature fpr its and
dereliction of duty, tfor its sins of par
commission and omission, dlenlies rep
that they did some good. Senator poP
White in his effort to stem the storm tihe
of public indignation whiich deluged vid
the last assembly, to oblivion we tail
hope, cites the following as tihe "re- oth
trenchment and saving" of that body. the

This startling array of figures is to
well calculated to take the ordinar? of
objector off his feet, and we do not er
propose to withholt the credit due ,
the Assembly fo. "savin" tihe 3," tii
365,475 13; but, that judgment in ri
this matter may not be canrried awnay ci
by figures, we beg to call attention
to, and emphasize the fact, that they i
are for the most part an enrumeration
of savings; that they show what had is
been previously expertded by Radi- 1
cals over and abore lthe revenrue of ithe lº
State, and we are proud to any thai te
the Democratic Assembly deserves nr
credit for not imitating their Radical oI
predecessors in the manner of thns f
expending monies. But this is not
the question at issue between th' ,º
people and the General Assembly. ,
All, or nearly all these savings, which i
Mr. White so graphicly enumerates, a
were brought about by the legisla- eC
tion had at thie session of 1877, save ti
the million hypothecated upon the C
Constitutional Amendments; but i
what the people conmplain of is, that it
the last session did nothing in the a
way of further relief. c
With all the "raform" mentioned a
by Mr. White, Louisiana still enjoys it
the honorable privilege of paying a
higher rate of taxation than any tl
State in the Union. We complain of o
what is in sight, thIe 13 mills State I
and the ten mill local taxation; the t,
immense power and patronage of the r
Executive and Legislative branches c
of our government; the existance of r
giant monopolies, powers within the t
State greater than tire State, and the c
whole drift and sentiment engender- d
ed by tire odious Constitution of 1S68, r
as be ng unrepnblican, degrading and
tending to subvert free institutions.
These are in part, tire "burdens" -a
which draw murmurs, complaint and C
expostulatton from thre people; these
are thre "burdens" which the General e
Assembly could have and did not,
relieve as of by calling a Constita
tional Convention.
We do not desire to object to a
siogle justifcation which the Assem
bly may offer, for they have need of
much apology for their sins. Mr.
White's speech is an opology, as a
justi6cation it fell stillborn, and the
people now move on to the accom
plishment of that which they had de
termined at the outset-an honest,
economical government in Louisiana,
under an honest Democratic Consti
tation.
REAR US.
It seems that our friends of the Sth
Congressional District are rather mix
ed on the quebtion of a candidate for
Congress to fill the vacthcy occasion
ed by the death of Leonard. The
Democratic press has been naming
men, from luke warm radicals all the
way up to played out Democrate.
John Young, Esq., of Claiborne is the
"big injan" of some of the "singular"
press of that District, and Young's
only record is that of a "Wheeler
Cgmpromises;" a dead flat failate a. a
legislator; a signer of a majority re
port in committee arid a voter tire
other way on the floor, and last but
not least a stalwart defender of Char
ley Howard's Lottery. If the 5th
District can't trot out better timber
than that as a democratic candidate,
we, down this way, won't take any io
tereat in the race.
Our party can never be benefitted
by the continuance of sucb men in
ofice, and the quicker "personal
friends" anderstand this the better.
We nominate GEORGE W* MCCRA*
miE, of Ouchita, a life-long, straight
out Democrat, for Congress from the
5th District.

CONSTITUTIONAL PAR1TY.
Democracy, lure as elsewhere, if it '1
means anything or is any thing, is a ed I
progressive aggressive g; (IAtization of enti
the people. Such has bete its hid toly a ct
since the days of its ftolunoler, Tho;as sum
Jefferson. Pcn
Conservatism is but a respectal'e its o
lnameC unlder which to cloak that Ipar- V
IV Which to-day proproses to imitate cy
the Federal, the Whig, the American pro
aand the Irepublican parties. 't'hese N,"u
f parties have represented and do pio
i represent that faction of our the
r population which proposes to lestrict sist
º the liberty of the citizen, both indi- peo
] vidually and collectively, within cir- we
Stain harsh and imperious limits. In i
other wotds, they have insisted, and iptC
the republican party does insist to- 1j7
) day, that the liberties heretofore en ( su
Sjoyed by the people were reralnrled them nel,
' and that every efthrt to advance still tlit
0 farther either in the solution of main'si ass
Scapabilities for self government or in 110'
o changes or modifications made neces- by
0 saiy by man's advance in knowledge, col
and his increased wants, should be evº
0 strennonsly resisteld.
o Conservatism insists that we have ha
Senough; that the poor are but menials; tIfi
t0 that government is for the elegant and phl
Swealthy; in fact, it represents in Lou- Uº
)0 isiana the centralizing element of pe
- America. .1
t The Constitution which Louisiana Cc
suffers utnder to-day is a Ccl tralield al
Organic Iale'. It vest all power in the ed
p hands of the Legislative and Execo- th
tive branches of the government, and in,
op prohibits the people from the exercise a
- of those rights inherent in mankinid.
is In proof of this assertion we have but co
I to cite the existence, by statuary law, ,ti
. of monopolies, and the immense pow- tt
of er granted themn as sure protection 1p1
SF againtst the pe'ople This protection, in b,
3,' the case of Iloward's Lottery is car w
in tied to tile extent of depriving the et
F 1 citizen of a right of trial by jiry!
Oil Our premises can not be denied and
e 11pon)011 them has been built our strenu
onI ois opposition to the present Admini -
ad istration antl the General Assembly. "

ita- Hit 'Em Again.
It is hard for ye country editor to
o a .refrain from opening Itis battery thtus
3m- early in the campaign that precedes
of the fall election, but the fraternity of
Mr. Louisiana seems to be scltooling itself
by a powerful struggle, to be less for
ts a wardh, vigorous, and demonstrative
the aDd aggressive in its political move
>m- ments in the future. As for us, we
de- fail to see wherein the Democratic
press of this State has received any
est, encouragement, from those whom it
moa, Itelped to place in office, to work so
lsti- hard for the party again. Hereafter
we propose to know something else
about a man than his political creed,
before we throw up our hat and yell
for him.-Richland Beacon.
Don't talk that way. 'Tis heresy,
5th high treason. It was a great reform
ais- mieasure to cut down the printing to
for startation rates. The press was ofso
on- little service in the ten years war
against radicalism in Louisiana, that
The it deserves to be exterminated. And
uing then again you are wrong to say the
the press helped to put anybody in office.
You cannot get one otliceholder, from
Governor down, to acknowledge that
the the press was of any assistance to him
lar" is securing otlice. He will tell you
ug's that he was elected through great
oler personal popularity ana the grandeur
and power of his intellectual genius.
a. a The true-in wardness of Reform as
re- it is understood by tlte present State
the Administration is,

br ple.
bar- 2nd: Ezterminate the press.
5th 3rd: Levy extra mill taxes.

S5th: Protection to the bondholders.
lo- 6th: Protection to monopolies, snch
as Howard's Lottery swindle. The
tted Slaughter House swindle; !and others
in of like character. And lastly, but by
no means least, is, high salaries to of
nal tfcials at the expense of the people
