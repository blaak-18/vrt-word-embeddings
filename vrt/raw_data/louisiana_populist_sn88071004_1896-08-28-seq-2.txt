Our Nominee.
The reohle's party Congression
alt convention which met here Tiues- fi
day was comlnjosed of level hIeaded p
11'1, andl lhey a'ted nisely anu t
witlhi d0leslalch.
The In;iun whorn they nominated ti
for congreiss isi well known to the si
ieople of this district, who respect ,e
hiiii, and esxpe:.ial ly to the I'Poiut
lists wluho love himi. i
Two years ago IMr. Bailey made t(
the best c;~nvaiss ever mi:ae ill this ,
district by the candidate of any
part'y fr COnLgress. s
Ile won his tight, 'is :iknowledg- u
ed by numbers of fair' minihded )emn
ocrats. but was nmiscrably swind
led out of his seat by the contt.mnp
tible methods of hallot box stntling
so commllllouly IIuse, Iby the IBo)rbon
)emnoH'i'wats of the South.
Not bicing ab'e to emlloy law
Sers to contest without paying it
l:rg;e 1 ' fe ill ladvanlce, Ie Was 'oli
jplut d to sutllliti to the Outrlage,
and t;.e uwill of the people was
thwartd. 11
But the inanimnous and e.thusi- r
as.ticr nomination which the Plolu
list have given him this time shows
that they intend to avenge theim
selves of the injustice and give 9
Mr. Bailey another opportunity to T
turn down the robbers of American
liberty.
Mr. Briley has been a staunch 1:
Populist ever since he reached his v
majority. is a close student of po- I
litical economy, a ready debater t
and an intelligent, able and patri
olic speaker, and in his speech of v
a;cceptance promised to make the u
besteffort of his life to wint this
tight for the peopile. and we believe
he will do it. So if his friends and
the Populists generally will do t
their duty, Hlion. B. W. Badley will
be the next congressman troum this f
distLict.
Gettling Their Reward.
The Shreveport Judge says Gov. S
'Foster has appointed the School C
Board in Natchiioches parish as a
follows :

Thus we see the pap-suckers are
getting their reward.
Of course, we expected Demo C
crats to be app)inted by a Demo
cratic Governor, but it does seem a
that representative men who have r
the respect and confidence of the
people among whom they live I
sholod be placed in these respoensi- C
ble positions.
A few of the above named are
such men, but several of them can
be remembered only for their dir
ty ward politics in service of the
Democratic party.
It was predicted some time ago
that Major Holliogsworth and Up
shar Breazeasle, would be appoint
ed School Director and parish Su- t
perinteadent, respectively, tor their
"e'minen" services on the Board
of Supervisors of elections in thie
g.rih.
Thie irst debt has been paid, and
the "Majarh" is a School Direetor
and will doubtless be President of
the Board, and it remains to be
aeen it the latter part of the pre
'ditioa will come true and Upehur t
wildl get his reward.

Vit'hutt the People's Party.
,!Th, People's party was formed
from the members of the two old
parties and is an organized protest
:aainSt their nets-a protest not
only against their acts of com
missiion, but their acts of omis
sion ; a protest an,'inst the present
con(li'ins, which have been ag
grava'ted a t lou-and fold since we
tirst entered that protest; a pro
test azainst all the unjust and un
eq(Mal Itws now pressin, upon the
people so heavily ; ant, at the
soane time, a protest against the
unnellllre"t broken promises these
old l.a ti' hb:vc made over and
over to repleal these laws.
The Peoplh's pInty is, then, in
the s.rone4t sense of the word, a
PR( )TESTI NG PARTY.
We fin,! today that we have with
us the great bo(sy of the people
uliting in this protest and declar
inz rheir purlpose to resist furiher
wrong and oppression, and to aid
us in restoring to all men equal
rights and equal justice. The peo
ple no longer bear their wrongs :
they are all protesting against them.
Now we are confronted by the
grave question: Shall we cease
p:'otesiin simply upon a pronmise
that wcoads will be righhtd ?
For how many years have peo
ple lived upon promises Can
we live even one year moreo upon
promises ! Would it be wise, with
the bitter experience of the past
eating2 d(aily and hourly into our
very souls. to (cease protestin,
until the promises so feely and
so easnly given shall have been
pevforel : if prOmises are a
u2(5I , ronaln for not pro.testing,
then we have never had any rea
son for utter;ng the first lroest.
for we have :alwa.:s had prom(ises
galore.
We have asked this question
nmanvy 1lines, and we get this an
swer : "'Yes, we have ha, l promis
es, but we have never had before a
man like Bryan."
Well, we accor'd to Mr. Bryan
all that his mot extravay,:atlt ad
nlirers cn. claimi for him, and we
expect to work and vote for him.
But after all he is only a man, and
a man that has no mere right to
claim that his ;iFe is his ou n than
any other mortal man. We can
not, we (!dre not trust our salced
ctuse up in one human life.
Then the question comnos back
to us- it will not be sile iced-
shall we cease protesting simply
on a promlisc, aud one we have
had many times before made us,
and one that is today an unfulfilled
promise I
We wish to say to the People's
pirtyin all earnestness that if you
cease now to protcst, your labor,
your self denial, youar travail of
soul in all these pat years will be
given for naught. Yoa will lhave
lived and died in vain. Yen will
deliberately and willfully throw
away the grand opportunity now
offered you to accomplish s;:me
good,
Keep on protesting, then, until
the promises given us have all been
faittifully and scrupulously kept,
and then, and only then, will your
mission be ended,-Virginia Sun.
Why tLhe Lights Weut out.
People's Party Paper.
It was an exciting scene when
the ballot was taken at midnight
for vice president. It was plain
the convention was going for Wat
son. The Sewall men were trying
to force an adjournment. The
galleries had their cue and fried
"adjourn, adjourn." Tom Patter
son of Colorado, Stone of Missou
ri, and Gen. Weaver of Iowa, were
bolding a conference back of the
chairmana'sm desk. It was anything
to beat Watson. (en. Weaver in
person appealed to the delegates to
adjourn as they were "in no frame
of mind to nominate." He was
greeted with cries of "no," and
Senator Allen ordered the roll call.
The Southern delegations wiere
split up over favorite sas, sad it
wasplat no nomlassion would be
made on the rst ballot. 8everal
een of Georgia ran, with tremnb
tig lips, to the Texs~ ad Trns
ehaage their votes to Watson. Tom

the building. In less than twoe
minutes after StMout'sd isa ppea:r:nc.C(
the electric lights beg;an to Ilutter
:rld pale. While Texas chlaIoredl
for recognition to chani e her vote
for Watson the row of gallery

the lii'ht we: a:ain turlned on and
at "lI; to 1," sixteen minutes to one
o'clock Chairman Allen announced
Tom Watsoa's nomination and ad
journment immediately followed.
No power on earth can ever per
snade me that it was not the hand
of Governor Stone that turned off
those lights. And the maiiglinant
bitterniess andi vituperation. the
wrathv', lurid daunmation eurscs, in
vectives and persronal abli.se that
polred' from the I)cmoe'ats in the
,alleries :and in the hotels upon
that conventlion of Po .u!ists for
presunlinz to name a 'Poplli-t for
vice president were confirmation.
I never heard anything like it. It
was hell itself turned loose. St.
Lonis Democrat,, with whom I
becamIe acquainte.l and whom I
met afterward in the hotel lobbies
were white aS 1molten lava with
rage. As for ue. I drew a long
breath and said "Thank Go(d,
Populism still lives and Tom W\\at
son is its leader. Let the heathen
rage." Let the Populists of North
west Nebraska ewar these things
in mind. This is no exaggeration.
It was the deliberate purpose of
the Bourbon Democracy to break
and destroy the Populist party at
St. Louis.
The story of Bryan's nomination
is already well told to you. It was
made lpossible without a bolt by
the nomination of Watson. Peace
had already str.tched her wings
over the hall wl:cn the c4onveni ion
met next morning, -in I when State
after State which h:e'l come the're
hostile to Bryan swung into line
for Nebraska's gallant son every
vote was a pwan of rejoicing in the
hearts of the delegates. Even the
bitterness of Texas was gone and
Georgia raised shouts of victory
when she cast 5b of her 61 votes
for W. J. Bryan.
One word to close this long let
ter. Toe Populist party is the
coming party of America. It has
met its greatest crisis; met it
bravely, conquered its enemies,
conquered its own selfishness and
partisanism--the path of brother
hood union and victory lies broad
before us.

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 176 pages of laugh
provoking matter, and 44) full-pare
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
