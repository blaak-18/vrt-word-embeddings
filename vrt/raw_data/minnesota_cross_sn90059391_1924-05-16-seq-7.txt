KLAN CONVENTION ANSWERS
ATTACK OF LABOR LEADER
MIAMI, FLA., April 29.—The local
Klan, because of the unwarranted at
tacks upon the organizaation by War
ren A. Stone, president of the Na
tional Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, which held a convention
here recently, has been given a
splendid opportunity to present the
principles of Klankraft to the public
through the local press, by means of
B paid advertisement; both of the
local dailies having refused to pre
sent the Klan’s answer to Mr. Stone
through their news columns —one of
them declining to accept even a paid
Advertisement for that purpose.
Mr. Stone, in a public address be
fore the American Legion on Monday
evening, took occasion to link the
name of the Ku Klux Klan with what
be was pleased to call the “lawless
spirit which is abroad in the land to
day,” stating that the Klan is the
Xmptom of a disease which will
ortly disappear; but will leave a
scar on the body politic for the next
thirty years.
He said: “In the west we have the
I. W. W. to contend with, and in the
•ast we have the Ku Klux Klan.” He
declared that the Klan is an organi
sation which fosters a spirit of hat
red and intolerance, and as such
should be combated.
At the American Legion meeting,
the speaker’s anti-Klan remarks were
greeted with hisses from various sec
tions of the auditorium and, at the
conclusion of the address, the ab
sence of applause was a pointed indi
cation of the attitude of the audi
ence. It is predicted that, at the
next meeting of the Legion, Mr.
Stone’s discourtesy toward a large
percentage of the men who compose
the local post will be properly re
buked.
Mr. Stone also made an address in
the public park the next evening, on
which occasion he refrained from a
repetition of his previous remarks,
having been informed by the chamber
of commerce, who control the park,
that the use of the park by anyone
was conditioned upon their refrain
ing from abusive attacks upon any
fraternal organization, church or
sect. These are also the conditions
which the Klan is required to com
ply with when it obtains the use of
the park for public address—condi
tions which the Klan would comply
with voluntarily, whether imposed by
the chamber of commerce or not.
The following open letter was de
livered to Mr. Stone by special mes
senger the next day and appeared as
a paid advertisement in the Miami
News Metropolis:
“April 8, 1924

allege to be the purposes and prin
ciples of the Knights of the Ku klux
Klan.

“If the purposes and principles of
the Klan were along the lines alleged
by you, your remarks would be en
tirely justified. However, your re
marks, as quoted in the newspapers,
were absolutely misleading and a bald
misrepresentation of the things
which the Klan stands for, and I as
head of the Klan in this locality,
cannot let them pass unnoted and un
challenged. Contrary to your state
ments, the following are the cardi
nal principles of the Klan:
“THE KU KLUX KREED: We, the
Order of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, reverentially acknowledge the
supremacy of the Divine Being, and
recognize the goodness and the prov
idence of the same. We recognize
our relation to the government of the
United States of America, the su
premacy of its constitution, the un
ion of states thereunder, and the con
stitutional laws thereof, and we shall
be ever devoted to the sublime prin
ciples of a pure Americanism, and
valiant in the defense of its ideals
and institutions. We avow the dis
tinction between the races of man
kind as same has been decreed by
the Creator, and shall ever be true
to the faithful maintenance of white
supremacy and will strenuously op
pose any compromise thereof in any
and all things. We appreciate the
intrinsic value of a real, practical,
fraternal relationship among men of
kindred thought, purpose, and ideals,
and in the infinite benefits accruable
therefrom, and shall faithfully de
vote ourselves to the practice of an
honorable Klannishness that the life
and living of each may be a constant
blessing to others.
“THE SPIRIT OF TOLERATION:
Contrary to the charge made by our
enemies that the Klan cultivates ra
cial hatred and fosters religious prej
udice, it is the very name and per
sonification of toleration and fairness.
We teach that all men, irrespective
of race, color, creed, lineage or
tongue, have a perfect right to ex
ercise and enjoy the rights guaran
teed them under the constitution of
the United States, and we practice
this doctrine in its dealings with oth
ers. The Klan never interferes with,
interrupts, molests or disturbs any
one in these privileges. We will nev
er interfere with anybody’s religion,
political or fraternal gatherings or
parades, no will we deny anyone the
right of peaceable assembly in pub
lic buildings, the freedom of speech,
the freedom of press or the freedom
of worship. We do not discriminate
against anyone on account of the
religious or politicaal vreed, so far
as their rights as citizens are con
cerned. If the opponents of the Klan
would practice the same spirit of tol
eration .there would never be any
friction, ill will, strife or bitter feel
ing in any community.
Nearly every community neeeds a
Klan to teach and exemplify the spir
it of toleration and to overcome the
prejudice and unfairness of certain
men.
“The Klan is a loyal friend, fearless
defender and staunch supporter of
the American free public school. We
seek to defend it against the insidi
ous attack of its enemies and to
every possible improvement in
the system that can be devised to
mske it more efficient. To this end
we advocate:
“(1) A national department of ed
ucation, with a secretary in the cab
inet.
“(2) A national public school at
tendance law for all children, irre
spetive of race, color or creed, until
they have completed the eighth grade,
including the study of the English
language.
“(3) A liberal federal aid for pub
lic schools, based on the scholastic
population of each state or the effi
ciency of the schools.
“(4) More efficient and better paid
teachers in our public schools.
“(5) A special course in all schools
and colleges in the study of the con
stitution of the United States, and of
♦he state where such schools are lo
cated, to include the duties of Amer
ican citizenship.
“For these reasons every commun
ity ought to be vitally interested in
having a Klan that these educational
ideals may be realized.
“LAW ENFORCEMENT: In every
community there is a pressing need
for better law enforcement. The of
ficers cannot succeed unless they have
the backing of the citizens. The Klan
creates a sentiment in favor of law
enforcement and this gives the offi
cers the very backing they need. The
lawless element gets mighty restless,
uneasy and shy, when they learn
there is a Klan in the community.
They know that the Klan stands
for law enforcement, and that Klans
men are looking and listening. They
immediately begin the cry “Take off
the mask.” It is not the mask they
fear; it is the secret membership.
They want to know who to watch,
and who is watching them . No good
man is afraid of the mask.
“The presence of the Klan in any
community has at least four good ef
fects in this line: First, it causes
the officers to be more active and
alert because they know that if they
fail to do their duty, the Klan will
seek to replace them with men who
serve the people’s best interest and

enforce the law. Second: it deters
and prevents many criminals from
violating the law because they fear
some Klansman is looking or listen
ing. Third, it minimizes the danger
of mob violence, because no Klans
man will participate in an unlawful
mob, nor will he allow others to do
so if he can prevent it. Fourth: ev
ery Klansman is obligated to report
all law violations to the proper au
thorities and help to enforce the law,
but the average citizen will not do
this, unless called on by the grand
jury. On this point I would like to
add that—
“l know of no other secret or fra
ternal order that obligates and binds
its members to such a policy of law
enforcement. No community is free
from law violators, and for this rea
son the existence of the Klan is uni
versally justified. It fills a distinc
tive place and does a specific work
everywhere. It puts the eyes and
ears of the sheriff, grand jury and
court in every part of the county —
and woe be unto the crook and crim
inal!
“In this respect we do not mean
to stand on our front steps with a
shotgun to kill the first brute that
comes along to desecrate our homes
or defile our women; nor do we mean
to air our family scandals in police
courts where the wrongs can not be
righted and the culprit often goes
free, but we aim to teach all Klans
men to have such high and holy re
gard for the sanctity of their homes
and the sacredness of marriage rela
tions, that they will neither violate
their own home ties, nor desecrate
the homes of others, nor detile the
purity of young womanhood, nor rob
young girls of their priceless virtue.
“We mean to protect our homes by
cultivating a holier reverence and a
higher regard for the sacred relation
ship of the sexes and protect our
women by living clean, cnaste, moral
lives ourselves. This and the influ
ence of such men on outsiders will
save thousands of homes from ruin.
“Every influence needs this sub
lime influence of the Klan; therefore
the existence of the Klan is a uni
versal need. The Klan is made up of
the highest type of citizens, leaders
in their respective communities, from
every trade and profession. The Klan
is not anti-anything; but is one hun
dred per cent pro-American and
stands the staunch defender of Amer
ican institutions against all their en
emies whomsoever.
“It might be of interest to you to
learn that more than fifty per cent of
the men composing the audiences at
the gathering above referred to, are
Klansmen who were well aware of
the falsity of your statements, and
your remarks only caused among
them a feeling of amazement at your
lack of information on the subject
you were attempting to discuss. In
the kindliest spirit, I assume that
your remarks were made in ignorance,
rather than being prompted by a
spirit of malicious mischief, and I
sincerely trust that you will thor
oughly inform yourself regarding this
great American movement before
you again attempt to discuss it, in
public, at least. The standing in this
community of the undersigned can
be ascertained by reference to any
bank in Miami or the Miami chamber
of commerce.
“In conclusion, I remain,
“Sincerely yours,
JAMES WALMY.

ST. MARY’S W. Va., May 5.
Following in the wake of the cyclona
sweep of the Ku Klux Klan which has
been taking West Virginia by storm,
the Junior Ku Klux Klan hit the
mountain state and is going over
with a rush and a roar. Enthusiasm
Is running at high pitch and young
Americans are fast rallying to the
standard of the mighty movement.
Two red blooded young Americana
who live at Adlai, a small village
sixteen miles south of here, recently
walked thirty miles In order to unite
with the mighty force of the Junior
Klan. They were initiated here.
Following the initiation the boys
made short talks in which they laud
id the new order which they had so
•ecently become members. They said
‘.hat they had walked from their
lomes (sixteen miles from here) and
hat they were going to walk back.
They added, however, that the lesson
hey learned more than repaid them
or the sum of money expended for
nltiation fees and the effort put
’orth. The boys were well pleased
vith the principles of the Klan for
mung Americans.
Mighty Movement
Not only those boys but scores of
>ther wide awake young men art
iterally pounding at the doors of the
funior Klan for admission. While
iropagation In the Junior Klan was
mpeded slightly during the school
nonths on account of boys being
>usy with their studies, the end of
he school year Is now looming over
he horizon and young men are. be
ginning to think about uniting with
he great organization that teaches
hem patriotism and gives them a
general, healthy knowledge of the
;reat outdoors.
The Junior Klan Is restricted to
shite, gentile, Protestant boys and
treat care is exercised to see that
>nly straightforward, competent, up-
Mght men are placed at the head of
he various boys' lodges throughout
he state. Attention Is called to the
’act, however, that the Junior Klan is
lot only a lodge but is a movement
with everything one hundred per
:ent American as its goal.
NEW BRUNSWICK
PAPER REFUSES AD
Advertisement For Elan
Is Dubbed As Ques
tionable
SOMERVILLE, N. J., May I.—Re
eeatly a man called on the Home
News Publishing Company, of New
Brunswick, N. J., which publishes the
New Brunswick Home News. The
man presented an advertisement for
insertion in the paper, which read:
“If you are a native-born, white, Gen
tile Protestant American citlxen and
interested in an organisation which
stands for Americans and American
institutions, that loves this country
and its flag, and is now operating in
New Brunswick, Middlesex county,
and you desire information on the Ku
Klux Klan, address your inquiry to
P. O. Box 870, Somerville, N. J. All
communications will be strictly con
fidential.”
The young lady at the desk refused
to accept the ad, stating that it was
questionable. The following day the
man la charge of the company ad
vised that he would take the ad un
der consideration and give an answer
on the next day. On the following
day he reported that he could not ac
cept the ad inasmuch as the paper
was a public servant and the Klan
stood against the the Catholic
and the Jew. Of course he was sim
ply ignorant cT .he truth, but he still
refused to accept the ad. He was
advised that similar ads had appeared
in papers in Just such territories as
New Brunswick, as it was a paid ad
vertisement like any merchant’s ad.
It seems that this paper like many
others in the country is afraid of the
influence of un-American forces. This
Klan ad would have bothered nobody.
It was designed to reach certain peo
ple and would have done so without
harming any one.

DAILIES GROWING
WAR I OF “EXPOSES’
Syndicate Writer Makes Fran
tic Effort To Sell Literary
Goldbricks.
WASHINGTON. D. C.. May ».
That magazines and newspapers, op
posing tbe Knights of the Ku Kluz
Klan, are beginning to "smell a rat,'
is seen in the desperate efforts of a
disgruntled former employe of the
Klan to sell a manuscript which Is
another "expose" of the Klan or
ganization. The man in question, up
to this date, has been unable to
place the "expose" due to the fact
that publications are beginning to
realize that they have been “sold"
Innumerable times on fake exposes
which afterward turned out to be
:he veriest rot and reacted on the
publication publishing them.
It is known that the man attempt
ing to peddle the manuscript is in
the employ of a news syndicate
which has to date refused to handle
it in any way. Other publications
have turned a deaf ear and the
young man in question is growing
frantic. It is understood that this
:nan, while "covering" a story, be
:ame acquainted with a former em
ploye of the Klan. The latter fur
nished the material for the "expose"
,'old-brick but as stated before, news
papers are becoming wary of taking
for granted everything that is her
alded forth as an "expose" by men
hrough different reasons, have been
Jischarged by the Klan.
Norman Hapgood Approached
It is understood that among those
who have refused to handle the
itory, Is Norman Hapgood, one of
he pioneers in "exposing the Klan."
It Is apparent that Mr. Hapgood Is
incoming more experienced in this
lne of business, realising no doubt,
hat the "expose" game la becoming
ihreadbare so far as the Klan is con
cerned. The Klan organization is
waxing strong and carrying Ameri
canism forward and aiding In the
Jh - * Man work of true Americanism.
Possibly, however, some unwary
lublisher will be tricked into buying
he manuscript gold-brick and Klana
uen will be afforded the pleasure of
*eadlng It. That Is, if he is not
:ired of reading the thousand and
>ne things already printed in an at
empt to kill a thorough American
irganization by alien influences.
The expose might afford a laugh—
no doubt it would to thousands of
Klansmen.
In the meantime, the news syndi
cate employe is making frantic ef
forts to unload the gold-brick and
Is keeping the wires hot. One of
Chicago’s leading newspapers has
been offered "the chance of a life
’.lme” to print the "expose" but to
late has not been caught up aa have
'he many other papers. It would
mem that the great indoor and out
loor sport of "exposing" the Klan
is about come to an end. Failure to
prove any of the thousands of
charges has no doubt brought this
about.
Entered Game Too Late
It would seem that the young man
and the disgruntled former employe
of the Klan have entered the “ex
posing” game after It had been
milked dry by sensationalists after
the mighty dollar:
It Is believed that the Bureau of
Publication and Education. estab
lished at Washington, and which is
putting the truth before hundreds of
thousands of readers each week
through The Fiery Cross, has done
much toward stopping the flew of
“exposes” from the pens of persons
seeking either money or noterlety,
or both. With the light of truth
emanating from the Bureau of Pub
lication and Education eaoh week,
the people are not so easily foeled
by those who would wreck an Amer
ican organization for money or be
cause they were of a pro-alien mind.
"BRASS TACKS”
Breaking the laws of your land
is pretty much like breaking your
own neck. The government, backed
up by our little old Constitution—
that’s the head; and the public, the
folks that have to obey the laws—
they are the body. Now, the head
wouldn’t amount to much if there
wasn’t a body fastened to it some
where. And the body wouldn’t be
worth a row of pins if It didn't have
a head on it. So there you are The
neck fastens them together, that’s
all. Most of us Klansmen have got
too much sense to break off our
neck for the purpose of hurting our
head, and we are trying to get all
the people to know that breaking a
law to spite our government is about
the same thing. And when you come
right down to “brass tacks”—as the
saying goes—the kind of head a fel
low has, usually matches his body
pretty well anyway.
It Is said that Henry Ford helped
the anti soviets with money. Nobody
t'nows about this except Mr Ford and
he has probably forgotten. What a
M .ne thing It would have been had Mr.
Ford exercised his prescience and fig
ured that a true American university
would have done more to light the

CUTS COST OF HOME LIGHTS
Electric Illumination Expense Is Re
duced Owing to Invention of New
Lamps.
Recent reductions in the prices
charged the public for Incandescent
electric lamp*; have disclosed that aa
electrically lighted home can now at
tain a thousand candle hours of U
lamination for pretty clone to 10 cents.
It la also brought out that In the
thirty years from 1800 to 1920, the
cost of lighting the average home ey
electricity dropped from 89 cents per
thousand candle hours to 11 cents
This was due in large measure to a
succession of inventions end discov
eries, the outcome of patient labora
tory research, each of which contrib
uted to an Increase In the efficiency
of the Incandescent lamp and thereby
a reduction In the coat of Illumination
obtained.
There has not been a year la the
span of three decades mentioned that
costs did net drop noticeably, except
since 1918. Daring the last seven
years, the reduction haa been but a
fraction of a cent each year. Mean
while the quality of light furnished
has Increased almost beyond compar
ison, as those who recall the old-fash
ioned carbon filament lampe. In which
bamboo was used at first, will appre
ciate.
Three different styles of lamps were
popular during this thirty-year period.
The old style of sixteen candlepower
carbon lamp was the most In favor
from 1890 to 1906. In that year the
Gem lamp waa introduced, and the 60-
watt type of that kind of lamp was
the moet used. Then the Mazda tung
sten lamps arrived. These were the
result of Dr. W. D. Coolldge'e dlscov
ery In the research laboratory of the
Oeneral Electric company, of a method
of drawing tungsten Into flexible wire,
so that it could be used for lamp fila
ments in vacuum bulb*. From 1908
to the present time the 40-watt Maz
da lamp has been the most popular for
general household lighting.
Few persons could afford to Illumi
nate their homes brilliantly today V
electric lights had not been Improved
and their initial cost, as well as the
cost of current consumed, made com
paratively low.
HOUSE KNOWN AS A TOWN
Brick Building on the Crossroads In
Hunterdon County, N. J., Is
Called Perryviile.
On a crossroad in Hunterdon coun
ty, N. J., there stands a solid, lonely
brick building which enjoys a unique
distinction. It Is a town. In fact, the
town of Perryviile, and has been listed
on the map as such for more than a
hundred years.
The building locally Is also known
as “Brick Tavern,” having served
throughout its earlier and more flour
Ishlng years as a meeting place for
farmers of the neighborhood and a
resting spot for travelers on the post
road that runs before Its doors. It
was under construction in September,
1813, when the first nows of Commo
dore Perry’s victory on Lake Erie
flashed along the road and the bnlldlng
was christened “Perryvilla." A Jug of
whisky was poured over the green
bush surmounting the rooftree by way
of proper observance.
Because of tbe tavern’s site on the
east to west turnpike over which a
great deal of the state's traffle passed
at the time of Its erection, tbe tavern
of Perryvilla soon wont an the map
as a post wtiore the stage coaches
stopped, aad eentiauod to receive mall
as a town for a considerable period
after railroad service banished the
horses and their clattering omnibuses.
Even now the flavor of antiquity clings
about it, although it has been appre
ciably modernized by its present own
ers.
Hoop-skirts and copper-toed shoes
were found In the old bnlldlng when it
changed hands fifteen years ago, and
it boasts huge open fireplaces and
mantels and doors of colonial design.

Forty-eight bricks are laid at the foun
