The dance given at Mr. Lisbony's
residence was an enjoyable though
not largely attended affair. From
the sale of refreshments about $14
was realized which was turned over
to Mr. Pointboeuf, the blind man,
for whose benefit the entertainment
had been given.
Duson is a small place, but her

A gentleman remarked to The E
Gazette that the short, many and
puzzingly laid out streets of Lafa- s'
yette, reminded him of a man who ti
started to go to a saw-mill situated
some wiles from a certain town.
He said the road was so crooklred b
that in coming back he ran against sl
himself. d
The city authorities had five pri
soners at work Tuesday cutting
down the thick hedge in the public I
road near DI)r. Mouton's residence.
It had spread out and covered part h
of the road, and threatened to prove
a source of inconvenience, espe
cially at the corner. t

'The Gazette wants to see Lafay
ette go-ahead, and stands.ready to
do its share towards that end. While
the local papers can do a share they C
can't do everything. Let the peo- b
ple get together, and work in iar- tr
mony. In unity of action, we have tr
a lever that can do wonders. Let's
all get in line and woik for the com
mon good of all.
Last Friday the people of the zd. am
ward interested in public education um
gave a school picnic to which some fe
250 persons, grown and children, h;
attended. A most agreable day Pl
was spent, and Hon. Julian Mouton, Je
the President of the Board of School T
Directors, delivered addresses in am
French and English, and his re- ci
marks were well received. Prof. w
Wagner, has every reasoj to be d:
proud of his school. P
w
Ye Old Folks Concert drew a
good crowd to Falk's Opera House
Wednesday to witness its second B
entertainment. Judging by the ap- o1
plause elicited each and every one ta
scored an artistic success, and the
wish is general that the pleasure fe
will soon be afforded the public to
witness such another well-conceived,
and delightful performance. t1
Mr. A. Cayard, of this town, and it
Miss Helen Parish of Lake Chrles,,, bi
but formerly living in Lafayette were
martied Wednesday morning at 8
o'clock in Lake Charlcs,and arrived
in Lafayette, their future home the
same evening. The Gazette unites "
with their numerous friends in wish- in
ing them long life and abundance
of prosperity. t
The crying need of the hout, the y
most urgent demand of the day, the al
one thing that will surely give Lafa- st
yette the start to reach the position lo
destined for her by the fact of her pi
a magnificent advantages, is a central
3 sugar refinery. This is the firm
conviction of the intelligent business
a man, of the progressive farmer, in
a short, it is the conviction of all
1 those who have carefully looked
over the situation.
With their usual liberal spirit the
Srailroad boys are circulating a list
for the purpose of securing funds to
relieve the necessities of Mr Hole
man caused by the sad accident to
his little boy Frank, who, it will be
remembered, was so severely man
gled by falling from, and being run
over by a train he was trying to
catch on. Already a good sum has
been subscribed and collected, and
SThe Gazette takes pleasure in saying,
ell done, boys.
Mr. C. S. Morse, of Jennings
called on The Gazette Monday and
stated he was in town to put up
posters relative to and endeavoring
to interest the people of the town in
regard to the grand 4th of July in
Jennings where preparations on an
extensive scale are being made to
celebrate the day in a manner be
fitting the glorious occasion. He
hopes that a large crowd from this
town will attend, and promises them
an enjoyable time on the part of the
citizens of his town.
William Davis, alias Roy, a negro
is behind the bars. He sold a horse
in town Wednesday for $zo and
when the Sheriff heard of the trans
action his suspicion was aroused
that something was rotten this side
of Denmiark, and in consquence the
arrest and incarceration of Mr.
Nigger followed. The prisoner
claims to be from St. L.andry, and
says he was recently employed on
I)r. Boagni's place. Sheriff Brous
sard wired to the Sheriff of St. Lan
dry who answered that, with the
owner of the horse he would be here
Friday to investigate.
Hon. Julian Mouton, President
of the Board of School Directors,
is kept quite busy attending school
picnics. He was out at Witting
ton's last Friday, where the chil
dren of Prof. Toler's school had
given a picnic, and he by request
addressed !he people in French and
English on the importance of eda
cating their chlildren, and that while
the School Board was giving its
best efforts towards that end, the
people should not be indifferent.
It is just such talks as those of Mr.
Mouton that are creating the strong
sentiment in favor of public educa
tion that dominates this parish.
Wanted to Die.
A Mr. Smith living in the neigh
borhood of Royville attempted to
shuffle off the mortal coil last Mon
day. On the pretext of suffering
from the toothache he secotred some
laudanumn from a druggist and swal
lowed the eontents of the bottle. I
While under the stupor of the drug,
he was discovered, and a physician,
Dr. Scranton, hastily summoned who
immediately responded and applied
the necessary restoratives and soon
had him out of danger. It seems
that in regaining consciousness his
first remark was that the one who
called in the physician would have
to pay the cost of the visit, for he
be eternally- if he would. Family
troubles are given as a cause for the
rash act,
r
Delightful Picnic. f
Tuesday last the children, parents,
and friends of the public schools
under the respective charge of Pro- .
fessors Meaux and Martin joined
hands and gave a most delightful
picnic in the woods back of Mr. c
Joachim Revivillon's plantation. ,
There were fully zoo persons present a
and a look on the scene was suffi- 1
cient to assure one that ,the party r
were having a fine time. The chil- t
dren of both schools, though un- t
prepared, gave recitations that were a
well delivered, and appreciatively
applauded. Hon. Julian Mouton
the indefatigable President of the c
Board of School Directors-delivered f,
one of his instructive and interesting t
[talks on education, a subject which p
he is well versed upon. The pro
fessors and parents are to be con
gratulated on the evident interest c
they are taking in the prosperity of tl
their schools and with such feelings *i
it will not be long before great tl
benefits are felt. tl
A Sad Accident.
John i. McHam, a stranger who
had just arrived in town and who '
was on his way to see his mother
in Terry, Miss., met with a sad
death. at 2:3o p. m. Thursday.
It seems that he was walking on
a track opposite the round house,
whlen a road engine came backing
along; a railroad man who was
standling near cried to him to la
look out, but instead of step
ping aside, he got in the centre of i
al the track and was run over and in
m stantly killed, the wheels passing
is over his body and nearly severing it.
McHam was abo'it 23 years of
Sage. The following articles were
11 found on his person:
tl Certificates of $zoo worth of stock
in Copper and Silver Mining and
Milling Company of Rawlins, Wyo
e ming; a gold watch and chain,$S a2
st in money, card No. 219 showing
o that he was an associate member of
Sthe Young Men's Christian Associa
tion of San Antonio, a cirtificate of
O membership of Marshall, 'T'ex., a
e certificate of Rawlins K. of I,., tray
L- eling and transfer card from the
n National Brotherhood Boiler Makers
o issued by Lodge No. 75 of Rawlins,
a badge of that association, and a
s baggage check froim Houston to
SNew Orleans.
Coroner Gladu received a tele
gram Thursday night from the
Young Men's Christian Aosociation
s of San Antonio stating that McHam
3 had been employed there as a boiler I
p maker and that he was on his way t
g to his mother's home either in New I
a Orleans or Missi.sippi.
a Obituary, t
a Mr. Artortnio Caro, aged 63 years,
a a native of New Orleans, died very t
- suddenly early last Saturday night,
e at the residence of his son-in-law,
s Mr. Chas. Lusted. Deceased was
, setting in his chair, apparently in
e good health, when all of a sudden
he was stricken with heart disease,
Sand, in a few moments expired in I
the arms of his daughter. Mr. Caro
had long been a resident of Lafa- e
yette, and was well and favorably
known as a man of sterling charac
ter--affable, honest, charitable. c
His mortal remains were conveyed
to the Catholic church where the
r imposing services of the last sad
rites of the church were heldl. The
funeral cortege was one of the larg
est seen in Lafayette for years, and
was a testimonial of the high esteem
held for him. The Gazette begs to
tender its most sincere condolences
to the bereaved family
