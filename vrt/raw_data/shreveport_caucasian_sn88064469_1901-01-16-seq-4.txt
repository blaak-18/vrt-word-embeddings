Advertising and Its Results.
The man who has;.a buluness and
does not advertise that business is
simply overlooking possibilities for
money making teat should reseive
close attention. Advertising is not
as expense, it is an investment, from
which the returns will come back
t many fold.-Denison, Tex., Herald.
A few days since in a letter to the
tncasiau in regard to the renewal of
contract for space, the Sterling
IRmedy Co. says: We desire to say
that within four years, we have
sought and paid for $1,760,000 in ad
Svertising ' * that the returns
are just beginning to come in, our
a.Iles last year, being over 6,000,000
ooxes of Cascarets and with this
showing we feel encouraged to push
on with a new line of advertising,
ete, etc."
etc, etc.
And the experience of others is the
same, and yet, now and then som
good man believes he has contributed
t' the salvation of the newspaper
apl all connasted with it when hs,
it a spirit of charity contributes a few
tollars in advertaising spae.. But it

Balzme's Dreeches.
"In a little vii'age in the heart of To-n
min.," says The Onlooker, "there still
lives a small. hrlwn old man whose great
pride is that he, once had the honor of
making a pair of breeches for Balzac.
W \hen be trotted up to the chateau where
1 Balzac was staying, he found the great
author writing a novel in the garden,
;tarin: wildly aliut him. while he cover
.d shoot after sheet of paper with words
'or which a witld was waiting. The
ailor was fore,,il to interrupt the prog
.:n of the bcoik in order to take the
neasurenment of the writer. Balzac sub
nitted to the operation with a good
:raoe. and nmale only one remark to the
.perator. This ricmark was enigmatic.
No feet!' he said. and returned to his
work.
"The tailor, in great porplexity, In
r itirri of a sr v-ant what was meant.
:nil'was infor:nodil that Balzac wishedl to
save the trolo;.-r. made without openings
5 it the bottm. soI that he could sit and
3 rite in them w.thout having to put on
!ippers."
The Y. M. C. A. Fonader.
Edward W. Flrnst of -Iilw: ukee, who
-ecently dined in London with Sir-George
Williams. the founder of the Young
1 Men's Christian association, says:
"I found Sir (George at his counting
house, in Paternoster row. just behind
St. Paul's church. 114 cordinlly invited
me to line with himself and Lady Wil
llams in the historic room where the as
t sociation was founded in 1844. when he
summoned a dozen yetung fellow clerks
