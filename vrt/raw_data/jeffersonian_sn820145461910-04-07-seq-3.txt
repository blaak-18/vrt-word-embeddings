THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE,
AND A FEW LACONICS
— By L.A.L.
WATER AND GOOD ROADS THE
FARMERS’ NECESSITIES.
There are two important adjuncts
to farm development which the peo
ple of the United States have been
singularly blind to the value of.
Water and good roads will do all
left undone to solve the problem of
“how to keep the young men on the
farm”.
In our conceit, we are prone to
regard the Romans as a people who
were below the standard of Ameri
can development, as we understand
it, but if we would emulate their
road building and their irrigation
methods, our farms would be invest
ments to which no gold mine could
compare.
Aside from the need of abundant
water for irrigation, there is also a
great need for household purposes,
but the average farmer thinks first
of the stock to be watered, then the
crops to be moistened, and the “wo
men folks’ ” needs come last.
In the matter of arranging for the
conveyance of water to any part of
the farm—house, stable, stockyard
or field—recent inventions have
made it possible for any farmer to
install a gasolene engine whose mo
tive power is generated at small
cost.
Nature has long been regarded as
more or less the enemy of the farm
er, but while she may withhold her
bounty sometimes in the matter of
rain; and while the heat of the sum
mer sun and winds often prove dis
astrous, there is always some way to
procure water.
Os late years the United States
Government has spent thousands of
dollars for irrigation purposes.
In certain parts of the West it has
cost a great deal of money to install
the elaborate system of pipes which
are needed to make tillable lands
which have so long been desert.
By studying the plans used in
these cases, many farmers would be
able to establish less elaborate, but
equally successful, systems, assuring
their crops uniform moisture, and
the successful result is readily recog
nized as possible.
In the matter of roads, isn’t it
marvelous that the American farmer
has supinely accepted “hub-deep”
mud in the spring, and impassable
roads in the winter?
Isn’t it wonderful to think he has
permitted his crops to depend on the
condition of the roads over which he
must carry them to the market, or
the freight station for shipment?
Isn’t it almost unbelievable that
he has paid taxes for years and years,
to derive scarcely any benefit, except
ing the knowledge that he is sup
porting a representative (?) in Con
gress?
And the farmer can’t blame any
one but himself. He has been the
hewer of wood, the drawer of water,
the producer of the foodstuffs for the
dweller in the city, and has failed to
even ask for what the consumer has
demanded —and secured.
In the matter of road building,
the introduction of concrete has
been one of the greatest factors in
this line of development.
In the South, particularly, the use
of wooden blocks, either square or
round, was regarded with favor for
many years, until hygiene became
so potent a factor.
In Jacksonville, Florida, cypress
blocks of round shape were used for
many years on the principal streets,
but were discarded for the vitrified
brick, which has nothing to recom
mend it but its durability; Atlanta,
Georgia has recently adopted a pav
ing which combines durability, clean
liness and noiselessness. On a
foundation of concrete, made from
crushed blue stone and cement,
square blocks of wood, which have
been creosoted, are laid, and will
practically prove indestructable.
Os course, a road of this sort is
out of the question for country
roads, but the crushed stone and ce
ment, on a clay foundation, would
save thousands of dollars to the
farmers, stimulate the production of
crops, solve the problem of trans
portation, and bring urban and su
burban life in close touch.
It’s only ih the comic papers that
hayseed and whiskers adorn the
farmer; the real thing is rather a
live proposition in the matter of up
to-date machinery.
If he will now realize that there
is a good bit of consideration coming
to him in the matter of water and
good roads, he will have no need of
special legislation when crops are
bad, and the best way for him to be
gin will be to see that his Congress
men are on the job early and often.

The Boston Herald speaks of “po
litical reaction.” There’s been so
much of it lately it’s a hard matter
to imagine it ever becoming sta
tionary.

It’s a cold and unnatural day now

A preacher in Missouri says fash

the preacher has “been shown.”

Recent investigations in Pittsburg
show that six banks had formed a

A Birmingham, Ala., paper asks,
“Is American business and public

an answer is expected, we hope all
won’t speak at once.

Uncle Sam has issued a new cook

are given.

A milliner’s shop in a Southern

In a wide-spread strike among
miners 279,000 will be involved. If
there is any calling whose members
are in greater need of consideration
and better treatment than the miners
of the United States, the man forgot
to put it in the book. Here’s hoping
them success in their demands.

Chicago is still in need of mission
aries who will render first aid to the
domestic heathen. In their efforts
to break up gambling dens the police
have also to face the dangers from
dynamite bombs which are being
used to destroy the dives. Fanatics
are never satisfied with peaceful
efforts.
