Eopatitis, or Liver Cohplaint,
DVYSPPSIA AND SICK PIADACN3.
Symptoms of a mseased Liver.
DAIN in the right side, under the
I edge of the ribs, increases on pres

side; the patient is rarely able to'lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequetly eaends to (h* top of the
shouler, iid s asmnetimes mistaken
for rticste entionin the r.se The &aome
ach is atectsd with 4osa of appethe
and sickness; the bowe in general
" are costive, sornedfum alternatve with
lax; the head Is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen.
sation in the back part. There is gen.
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurted
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
DR. C. MCLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative they are an.
equaled.*

(N. O. Pica-yme, 6th.)
The Sub-Committee appuiinted oun
der the resolution of Senator Blaine
to investigate into the clharges of in
timidation and ontrages committed
during the last election, assembled at
10 o'clock Tuesday morning, in the
office of the Surveyor of the Port,
in the Costom-House. Present: Sen
ator Teller, Chairman, and Senators
Cameron, Kirkwood, Bailey and
Garland.
Senator Garland inquired if it was
not better for the committee to de.
uignate what programme of proce
date the committee would take in
their Ionvestigation, as it was import
ant the Democratic members should
know what witnesses to call for their
side.
Senator Teller-We have not ar
ranged for a formal line of Ioquiry
yet, but we expect to takeo up the
parish of Natchitoches finrst, and af
terwards Tensas, Caddo and other
parishes where charges of outrages
have been alleged. Proper time
will be given for the Democratic mem
bers to call tlheir witaesses.
Without coming to any decisioo the
matter was dropped.
J. E. Breda was the first witness
examined: Beside in the parish-of
Natchitches, three miles from cooun
ty site; was born there; am 37 years
of age; am attorney-at-law. Popu
lation of the parislah is about 21,000;
there are about three negroes to two
whites; was in the Confederate army;
was in the service from August
'62 to close of war.
My father and myself have always
lived in the parish; became a Be
publican in '71, and have always ta I
ken part In the eleetions since; I was
driven from home on September 22d
last; the way it happened was this:
As in the last campaign we had no
organization of the party, we ap
pointed September 21, at 10 A. M., to
hold a meeting fort the purpose of
organizalng our cl'b.
On the same morning there was a
Democratic meeting about a mile and
a half from our place.
At our meetang there were one
hundred and fifty people. I spoke,
and others did, and the meeting I nal
ly adjourned.
On our way home-our party being
only three persons-a body of armed
cavalry threw themselves in our way
and ordered us to stop. We asked
what they meantt They replied: I
"Never mind." I
One of them sald; "Shoot any d
fellow in his tracks who attempts toI
move.'
I told my brother in French to i
turn back, asjust then I saw another I
body of armed me appromehing. We
setraced our steps, an Goall, ater r
crlcling the town, we t home.
On Souuday, September 22, C. F. I
Dranguest, thn sayor of Natchit.
hese, came to my bouse; he'd not '
sposnto m slcselS84, on accoautat

reader myself, as thee was an armed I
body of mse who werq golngto kill I
us.
Ireplied-'d never surreader my- I
self alive; as I semembered tle fates i
of Twitchell and otlers. Mr. Dran I
guet answered us if we would leave
the parish no harm would oome to
our family.
DIt Breds and myself then got on
our horses and left the house. We I
went to the woods and stayed some'
time; having occasional intercourse I
with our bouase. Is Octobae Mr. Dran- I
guet came to oar place sad told myi

harm them.
Witneus-Republicans in the -par
ms ish are lmost law-abiding, and they
ard slaughtered like sheep. )During
my connection with the Republican
party I have never known them to
, do any acts of violence. I belonged
to the Knights of White Casnelit in
'67, Lnt left them when I founad what
their character was. I was United,
States Supervisor of Registration at
the. last election, but was not allowed
to see the election out. The Demo.
cratic registered vote, counting each
white man as a Democrat, was 17(00
registered vote of the whole parish,
4000. More whites vote the Republi
can ticket than negroes do the Demo
cratic ticket. Since reconstruction
the parish has been Republican. This
election, the Democratic majority is
2d 2900.
it CROSS EXAMINATION.
1e To Senator Garland-Have been a
t, judge and district attorney of the
I- parish. When I was a member of
rs the Knights of White Camelia, the
d Republicans had a majority in the
parish; they could vote more freely
'5 then than now. As a K. VW. C. I
swore not to allow any one with Af
- rican blood to vote; in this matcer I
nI followed the current of public opin
- ion; it was in '67.
d At the meeting of the negroes in
r Natchitoches on Sept. 21, not one of
them had a revolver. The whites
- held their meeting at thi Court
F Mouse, and after getting through
e came to where we were. I have seen
no members of my family, except
r my brother, who was with me, since
September 22.
® The body of men who stopped as
h* numbered 20, and about 75 or 100
yards there was a body of 150 men
Sadvancing. Our party consisted of
three persons. I was not afraid of
* he first 20, beeause a few men with
aif pluck could whip them. These
- me are nearly all natives of the
s parish; I have known them all from
boyhood.
To Mr. Kirkwood-We have a par
o ish judge and district judge. Tihe
r; parish judge examines all criminal
t cases and decides whether to send
them before the district jadge and
s grand jary.
Mr. Garland-Do you say the parh
ish judiciary were cognisant of the
outrages .
SWitness-I said so, not from my
own knowledge, but by hearsay.
To Mr. Teller-Many of the resa
pectable people would like to have
these outrages stopped, but they dare
o't go against the sbotgun sentiment
of publi opinion.
STo Mr. Cameron-My brother and
I were given two hours to leave
Natchitoches. My brother never
amade a political speech in his life.
' The witones retired, but not before
SMr. Garland had made arrangeaments
to have him called for ututre exam
Sination.
A. P. BREDA.
C Am a physician in Natchitobhes;
hbave always lived there except du
ring the war, when I was a member
- of the 2d Louisiana Cavalry. Took

Itoches, except as a voter and specta.
s tor. My eldest brother, a younger
r brother and a brother-inawlaw went
Swith me to a mueeting of the Republil
r eas on September 2.
The speeches at the meeting were
I, short ad to the point,
After oar party left the meeting we
4 were confrooted by the armed body
Smeotioned by my brother.
The witanas then related what the
i mob said to tihm, as relatcd by the
Sprevious witnem
Witnees.-I was armed, am always
.so; never have ccasion to use my
a arms. Believe my brother was also
armd.
s Witones went on to relate how Mr.
, Drsanget came to their house and
told thm the mob would kill them if
a they did not leave the parish. He
a promised if they woald go no one
* weold molest the family or destroy
* the house. The witness related what
his brother had testiised to, abont go

To Mr. Teller-The organisation
s now nl the parish, called "218." is a
Ssecret society, an outeome of the
t WhiteLeague. I wasa member of
the L. W. C. Believe the soelety

V. A. BARUon
I, Live in the parish andtownof
SNatchitoches; have lived there for

I wasin the infrantry service.
I Was elected Sherif of Natchiteches

¼. Itess4 et Mr. N. J6

l ordered to leave the place? I said, I
caine to see if such was the case.
Mr. Cunningham told me to stay a
r few dlays and he would call the "Ad.
; visory Committee" to see if the mat
Ster could not be arranged so as tb al
low me to remain. Mr. Cunning
t ham fell sick then and I went to visit
a relative in the country. After the
t lapse of somne days I returned to town
I, and Mr. Conningham called a meet
t ing of the "Advisory Conimittee.
He communicated to me that the
" committee had decided they could
I not withdraw their order against me,
as the Bredas and others had been
,compelled to go. He said many of
" the members were not in favor of
" making me go.
The reason he assigned for the ac.
Ition of the Advisory Committee was
ithey wanted all the opposition to the
Democratic party to be driven away
until after the election.
He said I need not go outside the
limits of thie parish, but could stay
with my brother thirty miles distant,
and after election I could communi.
cate with him and lie would let me
know if it was safe for me to return.
The memabers of the Advisory Coat
mittee of the Democratic party are
the leading men of the parish.
Mr. Cunningham is a leading man
of the parish and has always been
friendly to me. The negroes showed
no desire to leave the Republican
party, and were as firm in their sup
port as in former elections. Mr. Cun
ningham was a candidate for the Leg.
islature; don't think any othlr mem
ber of the Advisory Committee was
running for anso office. Mr. Riabay, a
colored man was also driven from the
parish; sobsequently a dead body
was found on the Sabine road which
answered to the description of Rabay.
Have not returned to Natchitoches
since I left in the fall.
CROSS-EXAMIrATION.
To Mr.Garland-Got here on De
cember 21, to appear before the
Grand Jury. Have not yet been ex
amined by them; have been told I
would be examined today. Have
been a Republican since '69. While
I was sheriff Mr. Cunniongham was
district attorney, J. E. Breda judge
and A. P. Breda coroner. There
were two Bredas, Blount, Lewis, Raby
and myself driven away by the same
circumstances. We were considered
the leaders of the Republican party i I
the parish. My family have not been
molested since I left. When I left
Natchitoehes on the 'frst occasion I

JOHN G. LEWIS, COLORED.
Have resided for the last nine years
in the town of Natchitoches; am 28
years of age. Attempted to take
part in last election, but was not per
mitted todo so. I was secretary of
the meeting on September 21. After 8
the meeting, at which the old olHeers
were reselected, the Bredas, Blunt '
and myself started for our respective
homes, golog in diffeent ways. On
reachiog home I saw colored men I
rushing past, crying, "The Demo
crats are goiong to kill Breda, Lewis
and Blant." The Brodas"'galloped
past my house, but did not stop to
answer my question as to what was
the matter. Immediately thereafter 1
I saw a party of men advancing. My
father In-law told me I had hotter go 1
oat and and out what was the matter.
I deolined to do so, as I felt a little
silk. I limmedately barred my doors
and went oat the back way to the
yard, where there were thick and tall
weeds, and hid myself in them. I
then saw the following party ride up :
Dr. Gallion, ex-Congreuman WM
Levy, J. P. Johnson,Beveely Tucker, t
Landry Charleville, Ernest Masson, I
Matthew Hqrtzog and Billy Gallion.
Dr. Gallion approached the haouse and I
BROKE IN THE DOOR.
The crowd ransacked the house in
their search for me; they repeatedly
made threats to kill me if they could I
And me; they were armed with rifles
and revolvers. Mr. Levy rode through 1
the weeds on his pony, searching fori
see, bat did not see me. He rode I
away, remarklng. "He's not there."
I stayed In the weeds ontil 3 o'clock
and then went to a friend's house, a
where I stayed antil eveoiog. At
8 o'clock in the evening I wrote a
note to D. Pierson, Distret Juadgense o
this offet: Wlhatdo you gentlemeen '
want that we should do? fI mean by '
"yea gentlemen," the Democrats. Mr. '
Pierson sent back Mr. J. G Johnson, a
the Supervisor of Registration, who '
haltsd in the street sad we had a co.t
versation. He said to me; "Jost this
muec is required of you; either to
eome up to the court-honso and take
yeor chances with Blunt or else leave
