“My son Frank Snyder has used
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills for a long
time. He never had anything to
help him so much for headache. A
year ago he came home, and I was
down sick with such a dreadful nerv
ous headache. He gave me one of
the Anti-Pain Pills, and after while
I took another and was entirely re
lieved. I always keep them in the
house now, and gave many away to
others suffering with headache.’’

THE JEFFERSONIANS, THOMSON, GA.
Author of "My Maryland”
‘‘Maryland, My Maryland,” has
been called “the best poem produced
on either side during the Civil War.”
Mr. E. L. Didier, in “Spare Mo
ments” (July) gives his reminis
cences of its author, James R. Ran
dall, telling of the writing of the
poem and its introduction to the Con
federate Army as follows:
At daybreak, on the 12th of April,
1861, the first shot was fired at Fort
Sumter. A week later, on the 19th
of April, some of the enthusiastic
Southern sympathizers of Baltimore,
driven frantic by the passage of
Northern troops through the city for
the invasion of the South, attacked
the Sixth Regiment of Massachusetts
volunteers with bricks and stones js
they marched along Pratt street to
take the train at Camden Station for
Washington. The soldiers, who were
fully armed with Springfield rifles,
fired upon the citizens, killing several
and wounding many others, some of
whom had taken no part in the af
fray, but were merely distant specta
tors.
When this startling news was
flashed around -the land, it reached a
young Baltimorean, who was a profes
sor in Poydras College at Pointe
Coupee, one hundred and twenty
miles above New Orleans. He wa-,
aroused from his classic studies, his
heart fired with patriotic enthusiasm
—and the great thoughts that surged
through his mind kept him awake all
night. At dawn he rose, sat down at
his desk, and wrote the inspired
Southern war-song, “Maryland, My
Maryland.” It was first published
in the “New Orleans Delta.” In a
few weeks it was copied by all the
leading newspapers of the South, and
James R. Randall, like Byron, awoke
one morning and found himself fa
mous. In the early June days of
1861, when Maryland still enjoyed
the freedom which is the birthright
of an American citizen, there was a
glee club in Baltimore composed of
some of the representative young
men and women. They met at each
other’s houses and sang the popular
songs of the day. One evening, when
the club was to meet at the house
of a well-known Southern sympa
thizer, something new, fresh, stirring
was expected by the guests, and the
young lady who had charge of the
musical program was in despair until
her sister came to the rescue by sug
gesting that the words of “My Mary
land,” which had so fired the South
ern heart, should be set to music.
Reading the stirring lines now for the
hundredth time, an old college song
which had been introduced into the
family by Burton N. Harrison when a
Yale student was selected, and when
it was sung that night every person
present joined in the refrain.
“My Maryland” was first sung
in camp at Beauregard’s headquar
ters, shortly after the battle of Ma
nassas, when the General invited sev
eral Maryland ladies with their es
corts to visit him at Fairfax Court
House. The band of the famous
Washington Artillery of New Orleans
serenaded the ladies. When the mag
nificent music ceased, the boys in gray
asked for a song from the ladies, and
<sl>e 3effer«onia»t
one of them, standing in the shadow
of the tent, sang “My Maryland.”
The refrain was quickly taken up by
the soldiers, and the camp rang with
the words, “Maryland, My Mary
land.” As the last words died away
on the evening air, the wild Confed
erate yell was given, with “three
cheers and a tiger for Maryland.” A
gentleman who was present relates
that there was not a cap with a rim
on it in camp the next morning. From
that time, Randall’s splendid lyric
was adopted as one of the leading
war-songs of the South. Inspired by
its thrilling lines, thousands of sol
diers have rushed forward to die. —

land, My Maryland, ’ ’ is sung is Ger
man. Travelers abroad hear it often
in serenades, moonlight boat-rides,
etc.)
