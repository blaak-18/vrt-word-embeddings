take the oath. But, for a variety
of reasons, he may put this off from
day to day; and then, perhaps, on
the last day, sickness of himself or
in his family; or some urgent need
in his business; or severity of the
weather; a freshet in some stream
which lies between him and town,
and which may make the road im
passible; causes the carelessness of
the taxpayer to disfranchise him.
This, of course, is not so apt to hap
pen in a city where trolley cars,
taxicabs, etc., spurt the citizen to the
Court House, in a pair of minutes,
and thus give him the opportunity
to register.
I have carefully examined every
reason advanced for this six months,
before the election closure of the
books, and I do not find the slightest
merit in any one of them. I see, in
the law, an unfriendliness to the
country vote, and a willingness on
the part of those who are responsi
ble for this law, to deceive the peo
ple. I shall be extremely happy if
the final effect of this new law is not
to disfranchise a greater number of
whites than of negroes.
JOHN LEE DIDN’T GET S. J.
COWAN’S SCALP.
Dear Sir:—ln justice to Brother
Cowan, who has been published
throughout the Union of Georgia as
one who had proven himself unwor
thy of employment by the Union, and
who, on account of some things he
had written President John L. Lee
concerning said information, said
President J. L. Lee preferred charges
against said S. J. Cowan and had him
tried before his Local on the 19th
inst., we wish to make a statement of
the facts as brought out at the trial.
The charge was, that S. J. Cowan
had written things that did reflect
on the character of a member by say
ing that the statement in the letters
sent out by the Executive Commit
tee and President J. L. Lee that he
(S. J. Cowan) had been refused work
by the State headquarters because of
his former acts were untrue, for he
had asked for no work of them. Con
sequently, could not have been re
fused, and he proved that it was un
true by asking the State President
and one of the Executive Committee
that was present if he had asked
them for work, and they said he had
not.
They said that the reason they had
written the Union that he (S. J.
Cowan) was unworthy was for the
reason that he had stated that he ex
pected to lecture in counties that
wanted his services independently of
the State headquarters.
Brother Cowan explained by say
ing that he did not mean to leave the
impression that he was going to work
in opposition or in rebellion against
the authorities, but as a local preach
er who had been engaged in evangel
istic work for the last twenty years
it did not suit him to take work un
der the President and be subject to
his call at any and all times, thus in
terfering with his other work that
he considered of much greater impor
tance than anything else, and on
hearing the testimony on both sides,
the membership exonerated him by
the overwhelming vote of sixteen to
two (16 to 2).
Mr. Lee’s action throughout the
trial showed that he was going to
turn out Brother Cowan, or take the
charter from the Local.
When Lee saw how things were
drifting, he said in a threatening
way that the charter of the State of
South Carolina was annulled for a
much less offense than this.
Brother Cowan was brilliant in his
defence all the way through. We
have not an abler or better member
in Georgia than he.
He has proven himself true ever
since he began work, and for a man
of Lee’s standing to come all the way
down here at the expense of all the
Unions of the State to try to oust
Brother Cowan for nothing, shows
the Boston Bean eater’s character
thoroughly.
When the vote was taken Lee an
nounced that he would go back to
Union City, call the Executive Com
mittee together, and if they saw fit
to concur in the vote of Swainsboro
Local—well and good, if not, those
voting against Brother Cowan would
be furnished with blank dimits and
be taken care of.
See what that means, Mr. Wat
son? Going to annul the charter,
and leave out such men as Rev.
Henry Faircloth, Hon. Wm. R. Kemp,
our State Senator; Hon. Wm. Cana
dy, Jno. T. Smith, and others, all of
the old warhorse Alliance men. For
what? Voting their true convictions,
no matter if it was against the liking
of Czar John Lee. Have you any
comment to make on this?
Respectfully,
Swainsboro, Ga. UNIONIST.
Comment.
I am heartily glad to learn that
the little bunch at Union City failed
in their campaign against Rev. S. P.
Cowan. John Lee’s bulldozing meth
ods when presiding over meetings,
and his underhanded way of attack
ing through the mails those whom he
cannot control, are not doing the
Union any good.
When the State Convention meets
Johnsey will have to listen to some
mighty plain talk. The lies that
man has told, in the interest of “the
little bunch”, and to keep things
hid!
Their name is Legion.
EVERY CITIZEN, ACCUSED OF
VIOLATING THE LAW, IS EN
TITLED TO A PUBLIC TRIAL.
THE TIFT COUNTY COMMIS
SIONERS HAVE, SEEMINGLY,
GONE FAR WRONG.
Dear Sir: —I received the knife
and think it is very nice. I would
not take a dollar for the handles if
there wiasn’t a bl; de in it. Also re
ceived the April fiumber of the Mag
azine.
I read in your Magazine that you
would allow the poorest man to de
fend himself through your columns.
I had the shame, scandal and dis
grace to sign my name officially when
Tift County was organized and
ready for business. I had the codes
and many of the acts in my posses
sion, and when the public roads
were to be worked by taxation and
convicts. As I had the law, a great
many people came to me to read the
road law to them, and to read it
themselves. The commissioners of
roads and revenues were forcing mi
nors to work six days or pay three
dollars in each year. The law says
all persons between the ages of 21
and 50 years who are not physically
or mentally disabled shall be subject
to road duty, etc., which you will see
in the Acts of 1907. Some minors
were not asked to pay the money or
to work the road. They were not
released from duty by the commis
sioners. I tutored the boys of the
Brookfield district that the law did
not mention the minor in the make
up of road laws. Some of the boys
paid or worked. There were two
boys, one a depot agent, and one a

rural letter carrier, that refused to
work or pay taxes, as the law did not
require them to do so. There were
minors over sixteen that were not
required to work or pay that had not
been excused by the commissioners.
They divided their payment, a dollar
and a half or three days’ work in
the spring, and the same in
The law only required road hands to
work thirty-two hours in a year.
One man worked twenty hours, when
the law only required sixteen by di
viding it. The commissioners swore
out warrants for him and the two
minors that refused to pay or work,
and had them arrested and put in
jail. They gave bond, and were tried
in the commissioners’ court, behind
closed doors. They employed coun
sel, and he defended them ably, but
to no good. They were fined fifteen
dollars or thirty days in the gang
each. Their attorney certioraried
the case, and carried it to the Su
perior Court. The Judge of the Su
perior Court has never passed on the
papers. The case stands just as it
left the Commissioner’s Court.
Please advise me on such law and
ruling through the weekly Jefferson
ian, so all Judges and all Attorneys
can read it, and advise through The
Jeffersonian whether such proceed
ings are Law. If so, what need has
Tift County for a Senator and Rep
resentative? Yours truly,
R. L. GAY.

OPPOSED TO METHODS OF “FUS
SY LEN BROUGHTON”.
Dear Sir:—Permit me to pull my
hat off to your good self and con
gratulate you on your reply to one
Mr. Ellis, a Pennsylvanian. It is so
replete with truths and all that
stands for old-time patriotism shat it
should at least open the eyes of
some of the numerous victims of the
increasing lunacy regarding Foreign
Missions foisted upon this country by
fussy Len Broughton and his kind,
who are ever ready to send the
“other fellow”.
I thank God that we have one man
in our Southland, who has the cour
age and force, to publicly condemn
this craze in such an able way. Your
having done so, in self-defense, will
have the entire approbation of all
deep thinking, good citizens.
It is unfortunate that your reply
could not be circulated in pamphlet
form, going into the household of
every American citizen. The good of
our Anglo-Saxon race demands that a
halt be put to this Foreign Mission
enthusiasm.
With great respect,
Sincerely,
JOHN VAN LANDINGHAM.

the readers of the Magazine a true
