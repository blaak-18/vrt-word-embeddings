Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINGAR BIT
ERSt ?" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great, blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invig.rator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vis
EGAR BITTERs in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Di. WAxT

lurking in tlie system of so many thou
sands, are effectually dcstroyed and re

.or FemaleComnplanltts, in young

that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
w.henever yon find its im urities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,

it when it is foul; your feelings will tell

health of the swstem will follow.
