IRRIGATION RICHES.

How the Sandy Waste. of Southern

SAN FRAN.c.co, Juie 19.-PresidPnt
M h Kinley while in California on his

W\\len it gradtlunaly becamne known
how valuable theise lands ot11hi Ie
mnia:I by bringing water to thini
tlhrollgh the dry season, efforts were .
nI11ade, t first In a small Wiay andll tihen
on a I:ar'er scale, to bulild canals a:nnd
ditches ill which to draw water friomIl
the nIirlry Stl't'illlln . SVonll '4I aii):]II('4,
were formell'd whih hre the expen.iS of
censttleting the canals. They sold wa

per year, varying In 44some districts
from i4 . cents to $5. aeuording to the

been sought in a number of instance .
and effectively rendered by the U'nlted
States geological survey. So important
a factor has water become In develop
leg the aril west for agriculture nnd
settlemnent that it may be considered
a the very lifeblood of the land.
One of the late United States geolog
clal reports. in speaking of the advan
tages of Irrigation in the San Joaquin
valley. gives an interesting illustration
of the difference In the value of land
with water and without it. "Take, for
example, a crop of alfalfa. Six crops a
year of this clover, with a yield of two
tins to the acre, are not unusual where
water is delivered to the land. The al
falfa raised in this valley is much supe

Ing to the e:.vernin dryness of the at
niosphere in the San Joaquin valley the
hay is cured quickly without noldl and
retains nill of Its nutritious qualities.
Taking one year witl l another., alfalfa
hay will yield a proflt over,and alove
all xpenses of $_ a ton and probally
mor., if ,fd to stock. This j.aktes tLe
land easily worth $'( a) an acre, which
for wheat raisang wou'kl not bring more
thbp $30, a,high estimate."
If it is, true that "he is a public bene
factor Whb mkces two bladeS of grass
grot', where one gr'ew l.e(Ore," wh4t
shall be saidof him who. makes six
crops 4f alfalfa grow where due crop
of .hbat grew before? Other Ctroos
mlghlt be mentioned which would male
even ,a better showing. but the fact Is
that 10 acres of land with water are bet
ter than 100 acres without water, and
this means that with water the lands
will support in plenty ten times as
many as can now earn a scanty Ilveli
hood on their by raising cereal crops.
Not long ago the New York Tribune
printed an interview with Mr. James
J. Iartley, a prominent Citizen of San
Francisco. Ils remarks have a special
interest in this connection.
"You have heard much in the east of
the wonders that irrigation has actom
plished in the west." said MIr. llartley,
