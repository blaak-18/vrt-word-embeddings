out remorse, and wore without
shame, the diadem of the Caesars.
I will close for this time; will write
more on this subject again.
Praise to The Jeffersonian, and
long live the man behind the gun,
and may his aim ever be true, for
he knows where to aim to hit the
spot. Praise to his name, may he
live a thousand years, and may I
live to plant a rose upon his grave.
I beg to remain,
Respectfully yours,

I WISH THAT THERE WERE MORE
J. R. HANEY’S.
Dear Sir: —I herewith enclose you
my check for SI.OO, for which
please enter my subscription for
your Magazine. Some three months
ago I decided that the only way to
get rid of one of your admirer’s (J.
R. Haney) was to subscribe to your
weekly Jeffersonian, which I did. I
do not agree with you on everything
you say, but I find so much of good
in your Weekly until I want your
Magazine.
I had an old negro client to come
in my office the other day while I
was reading the issue of December
9th, and especially Mr. Miller’s let
ter. I said to this old darky: “Uncle
John, what do you think about For
eign Missions?”
“You mean does I believe in ’em?”
I told him, yes.
Ans. “Mr. Clyde, I believes in ’em
as fer as God send him, and He will
pervide de way fer missions to go.”
I thought at the time that this old
darky came very near expressing
your views about the salary part of
Foreign Missions, and that I would
write you about it.
Respectfully,
CLYDE R. CONNER.
Hattiesburg, Miss.
WITH YOU ALL THE WAY
THROUGH.
Dear Sir:—l feel like we all
might say a good word to you once
in a while to let you know how we
feel about the hot shot you are pour
ing into the Foreign Mission busi
ness, preachers, the ship subsidy,
etc., I, for one, am with you through
out, Socialism not excepted. The
way I see it, you have given the
other sides a square and fair deal
all the way through, and it seems
to me that some of the ministers
have not showed much genuine reli
gion on the Foreign Mission work.
In conclusion, I will say keep
pouring it into all these rotten
things, and your photo will always
hang face foremost in my house.
Your friend,
J. L. ANDERSON.

FROM AN OLD SCHOOLMATE
AND LIFELONG FRIEND.
Dear Tom: —I know that you are
quite a busy man, and haven’t much
time to read notes from your friends.
But I must say a word of congratu
lation to you on your two Jefferson
ians. Why, bless my life, I thought
they started at high water mark,
but they get better and better.
Couldn’t do without them at thrice
the cost.
Oh, how I glory in you! For you
have downed the Foreign Missionary
fanatics on their present methods of
procedure. And you are completely
routing the leaders of that rotten
mess called Socialism. And, my!
how those editors of the so-called re
ligious press have brought them
selves into contempt with fair-minded
people. I tip my hat to the Rev. Mr.
William Dunbar, of Atlanta, for I
well remember him way back in the
90’s. I would love to shake the hand
of all those who still wear the hon
est scars of those trying days. But
for all those who have turned their
backs on our principles, and gone
over to the enemy, I have nothing
but contempt.
Am watching with much interest
for the final outcome of that little
rumpus between you and those
Farmers’ Union Big Ikes, as you call
them. I read the T. J. Brooks ar
ticle in the Union News (away back
in October, and thought at the time
that it was mighty strange logic on
the Ship Subsidy question. I read
the Union News every week, and am
still waiting and watching to see
those Union City fellows meet your
charges openly, as it seems to me
that any innocent man would rather
do than not.
Merry Christmas, and a triumphant
New Year is the wish of one of your
friends all through your past life
and on up to this good hour.
E. A. WILSON.

FROM AN OLD DEMOCRAT.
Dear Sir and Friend: —I have been
a reader of your valuable paper and
Magazine, borrowing from my son
in-law, J. W. Sherrill, who is one of
your subscribers. I am very much
in sympathy with your views, upon
every subject you write upon, that I
have read in your paper and Maga
zine. I was cradled in a Democratic
cradle; and have never voted a sin
gle vote outside of the Democratic
ranks. Your writings have opened
my eyes more than anything that I
have read along the political line
since the war. I say amen to your
position on the missionary subject
(that is to the heathens), and to
your turning the light on the damna
ble doings of Catholicism.
Yours truly,
E. W. NUNBY.
Cook’s Point, Texas.
THANKS FOR THE BOOK.
Dear Sir: —I send you a book,
“Thirty Years in Hell,” I want you
to publish in your two Jeffersonians,
as they have a big circulation. I
think you are a Moses inspired by
God to save our country. You are
throwing more light upon the evils
of the day than any man I know of.
Yours truly,
J. A. POPE.
A FINE LETTER FROM ONE OF
THE EDITORS OF THE PRIM
ITIVE BAPTIST.
Dear Sir:—l wrote you some
months ago I would exchange the
Primitive Baptist, published at Mar
tin, Tennessee, for The Jeffersonian.
I wrote to the office at Martin, Tenn.,
to send to you. I have not received
a copy yet. I edit the Southern De
partment. I suppose you get the
Primitive Baptist. Send the weekly
Jeffersonian
NOTICE
To All Subscribers, Agents, Newsdealers and Friends:
With the issue of the February number (about January 24th),
WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE will appear in a new cover,
and will be much larger. It will hereafter be known as WATSON’S
MAGAZINE, or more familiarly, as “WATSON’S”. The price will re
main the same, ten cents per copy, one dollar per year; no more and no
less.
The features of Mr. Watson’s writing for the Magazine during 1910
will be “Roman Catholicism”, “The Story of the South and West” (his
torical and biographical), “Napoleon Up To Date”, and the most dra
matic part of “Andrew Jackson”, when he fought the proposed Central
Bank, and smashed it; and waged relentless war upon the robber Tariff.
THE JEFFERSONIAN will be larger and better this year than ever
before. Our subscription list is growing at an unparalleled rate, and
we are giving our subscribers the benefit of our larger revenue. We
would like to have the paper known everywhere as “THE JEFF”.
We ask our friends to go out as missionaries among the heathen
at home, and bring in all the mentally halt, maimed and blind, who
don’t read “THE JEFF” or “WATSON’S”, and set them down to a sam
ple copy. We want 1910 to be the banner year of our two “Live W ires”.
Thomson, Ga., Jan. 10, 1910. THE JEFFS.
Jeffersonian to me, 103 Daisy Park,
Macon, Ga., in exchange.
I am truly glad that you are show
ing up the many defects in the pres
ent modern mission system. It is
clear, indeed, that the present sys
tem is a failure. It is not scriptural.
It was first engaged in by the Cath
olics in 162 2. It certainly causes
people to trust in men and money
instead of trusting in Christ, who is
the only Saviour. In many respects
the so-called heathen are superior to
many of our enlightened people. It
is said that they are an honest, debt
paying people. Professor Clark, who
taught in the interior of Japan for
four years, is an Episcopalian min
ister and he told me that the Japan
ese are the most honest, chaste,
moral, upright people he ever met.
He said a merchant could leave his
store-door open and work in the field
with his goods priced and the Jap
anese would go and get goods and
leave the value of the goods on the
counter. He never had a cent stolen
from him while there, and they had
access to his money and clothing.
The goods there are not adulterated.
The women are chaste. No gambling,
no divorce, no sanding the sugar and
chalking the flour, but he said in the
open ports where the missionaries
have gone he could not say so much.
Their morals are corrupted. The
sons of the missionary teach the Jap
anese to gamble and win his money
while the missionary is preaching to
convert the others. He says the
women are not so chaste. It cer
tainly seems to me that the people
here should lay an example of good
morals at least before going there to
convert them.
Think of the church member in
America, and even ministers, shun
ning their just and honest debts’ Is
there any spirit of Christianity in a
man that will not pay his debts? It
would be a blessing if all of our peo
ple in America had all the noble vir
tues that Professor Clark says the
Japanese have. While we have many
noble, honest people, and thousands
of true, honest Christian people in
America, and have as good, chaste
women as the earth affords, yet it is
a sad truth that many professed
Christians would have to be tagged
to tell they are members of the
church. You can not tell it by their
fruits. The idea of a church member
who beats the merchants out of his
grocery bill and does not pay for the
clothes he wears occupying a promi
nent position in the church, and then
is one of the first to pay his money,
to be seen of men, to convert th©
Japanese, who far excel him in good
morals’ If they can save th'© Afri
can why not save the negro at home?
He certainly needs it. Save him first
before going to Africa. Why not
save the Chinamen in the United
States? I see no special effort in
that direction. Why not save the
Jew and get him to believing in
Christ? He already believes histori
cally in God. Why not save the peo
ple from adultery, gambling, drunk
enness, profanity and dishonesty
here at home? Christ alone can save
the soul. I want an example of the
saving people here before I pay my
money to a board to send men
abroad to save others. Just think
of the crime in our cities! Murder,
theft, blind tigers, gambling, wife
law, homestead and bankrupt laws
and divorce. They have preachers
and Bibles here. What is the mat
ter? No wonder the Chinamen, at
the World’s Fair in Chicago, seeing
so much crime in that wicked city,
said they were going back to China
and send missionaries here to con
vert the people of America.
I am glad you are exposing the
spirit of Catholicism that is enter
ing our happy, free country. They
are increasing rapidly and there is a
very close affinity between our rulers
and the Catholics. For the Cath
olics to get in power means a com
bining of Church and State, and our
religious liberties will be taken. We
should prize the liberty we enjoy of
worshipping God after the dictates
of our own conscience. We as a
people have ever favored this. May
God bless your labors in exposing
the many errors religiously and po
litically. I feel that you are doing
much good, and I wish your paper
was in every home.
Yours truly,
LEE HANKS.
