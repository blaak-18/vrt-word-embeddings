THRIO IOUIT TilE STATE.
fltcraoD BAucox: A difficulty (e
suired toIn the Exchange Saloon of this
place last Saturday between J. B Rob
lusonand--Brock. in which the lat
ter received a pistol shot wound in
the bowels, from which he dited on
Tuesday night last. As far as we
can learn whisky was the solo eau'Ie
,f this said affair. Both were drink
ing-Brock very drunk IRois,-on
,entered the saloon where iBrock was
md rubbed against him; Brock curs
id him, and in the quarrel that. en
ened drew a derringer: whereup "n
Boblason snatched a pistol from N.
O. Collins, who was standing near,
and shot him as above statedl,. oth
pistols fired, but Brock's shot never
touched Robinson. These are the
condensed facts as we understand
them, though we did not attend the
prellmlnary examination, which was
had beforehis Honor E.C. Montgo
mery, Parish Judge, on Tuesday and
Wednesday. Robinson was held in
a bond of 2,000 for his appearance
beforetheDistrict Court, to answer
to the ebharge of manslaughter. The
State was represented by lion. P. H.
Toler and the defence by Messrs.
Boeater and Liddell.
We withold the christian name of
Brook by his dying request, without
knowing why he made it.

a neigbor's, was overtaken and the
