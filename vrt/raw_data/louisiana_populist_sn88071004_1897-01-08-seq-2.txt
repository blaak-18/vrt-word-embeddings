~~OP : a
I Grand and Noble Charity.
A meeting of representatives of
I1- the drouthl slufterers of this parish
was held in the Court house Mon
day night, with Judge 1). Pierson
r. Chairman, and M. 11, Carver as
Secretary.
1reports were had 'from each of
0o ten wards in the parish, except
+ ward 9, and it was found that the
suffering was on the increase be
cause the many who made some
thing, though little, had exhausted
" their resources and were now re
0o duced to want.
o0 A committee was appointed to
no solicit the Police Jury to appro.
0o priate money for relief, which was
done, and that body; set ,aside
r $1000 of the Natchitoeches Bridge
re fund, the Natchitoches Bank kind
ly. advancing the money and ac
cepting the proceeds of the 1 mill
, tax belonging to said fund.
This is for the absolutely desti
'y tnte, but to help those who are
I able to borrow money and buy a
n little bread and meat, a committee
! of 3 with Chairman J. W. Freeman,
was appointed to try to raise $1000,
to purchase. immediately, before
i reduced rates are exhausted and
a place before our suffering people.
1- Mr. Freeman offered to advance
$100 ot the money if 9 others would
g do likewise, but they did not res
oe pond, Be then offered to sign a
g joint note to the Bank for the $1000
for 60 days, but the other signers
n did not materalize, though several
u leading merchants and lawyers
w- were approached and urged to help
the people upon whom they lived.
Not to be outdone and see his
! people lose the advantages of low
1. priced corn and meat and free
3- freight, Mr. Freeman then went to
the Bank and mortgaged private
property and part of his salary
n since in office, and obtained the
r money upon his own resources en
o tirely, the Natchiteches Bank again
' advancing the money without in
terest,
Through the Parish Relief com
t mittee this money was forwarded,
and soon the corn and meat will be
on hand, where those of the suf
r ferers who can raise a little money
can buy through their Police mem
ber, perhaps enough to prevent
suffering and enable them to stay
with their homes till another crop
can he made.
Most all of our people in a
position to do so, have shown
a willingness to relieve tihe ray
ages of that terrible drouth, but
there is no one man in this parish
who has done such a large mag
nanimous and purely patriotic act
of noble charity, as Jas. VW. Free

There is no government so de- C
cidedly under the notice of the
American people at .this time as
the Spanish. This is because its
method of management in Cuba
come very near to our own shores.
Whether our indignation, politcal
or actual, would be as deep if v
Cuba were 30,000 miles away, is
an open question; for much that is p
said and done in congress and out a
of it savors greatly of politics and e
wire-pulling, while real sympathy b
never savors of either. t
*
So, though by letter I have been
asked for an expression of opin
ion upon the Cuban question, I
shall not give it (at any rate not
yet), for the great ones of the
country still feel uncertain of the u
right thing to do. However, if a
your readers will allow me, I will "
spend a short time considering
Spain as a nation. Its, desperate
methods in OCuba may then be
more clearly understood. To con
sider an iadividuial carfully, to
weigh his faults and strength, is
ali:nys. interesting. To do the
nethiigto a nation is always n
i~iatereting also, but more compli
,ed. I aay, therefp9re, .be in g
error in my judgments. That I
leave to your rteaders.
i- In the fifteenth century 'Spain
n was a respected power in Europe.
is As a nation it had been solidified
out of a number of Christian elo
of ments, by a common antagonism
pt to the Moorish conquerors. In
e the sixteenth century it bad grown
' to an enormous empire, with vast
e- territories in the richest portions
'd of the New World. Streams of
e- wealth were constantly pouring
into its coffers from these con
to quered posessions. At the close
o' of the eighteenth, and the begin
a ning of the nineteenth centures,
le the outlying portions of this vast
nation began one by one to sever
all relations, until at present it re
il tains its hold upon only two sec
tions of any great importance
Cuban in the West, and the Phil
re ippine Islands in the East. Judg
ing by the past century, and the
e loss to Spain of every possession
in both South and North America,
p, it seems not unsafe to predict that
re the beginning of the twentieth
a century will see it return once
,. more to the actual limits of its
e possessions in the fifteenth. Now,
:1 then, what causes have operated to
a. bring on such decay of, prestige,
a while other European nations, like
0 Germany and England, Rusia and
as Italy, France and Austria, have
it developed and in some measure
.s kept close together in their devel
p opment-mentaland moral a Brief
1. ly put, I should sum the causes up
is as (1) Irreligious solicitude for
w God; (2) Greed for gold; (3) The
e Grandee spirit; (4) A wrong colo
0 nial policy; (5) Unprogressiveness.
e On only two of these features shall
S1I have space to dwell this week.
e The balance will be referred to in
I- my next.
Altogether Spain seems to have
been possessed of a demon of self
destruction, a demon that has ta
e ken varied forms in four centu
ries, but which, through them all,
Shas been forcing Spain steadily on
ward toward annihilation. Its
t wars with the Moors fostered a
r strong national spirit, and. because
the wars were religious in charac
ter, they tended also to make Spain
the stronghold of Catholicism. So
long as there was fair fighting
Spain was strengthened by the
conflict; for in certain stRges of
human progress war, with its at
tendant horrors, seems to have
been, if oc a necessary feature,
st any rate, an aid to civilization.
But spain, when the conquest was
practically complcte,:iand the re
maining Mloors had settled down
to agriculture and to trade, burn
ing with zeal for the God of their
bloody imaginings, called in to aid
in the complete extermination of
every heresy, that fiendish device
for populating Heaven and sav
ing souls, "The Inquisition." Their
conqeusts in the New World also
were in the beginning religious
conquests. Their adventurers were
to win vast glory for the Church,
and so in the name of Almighty
God, most joyously did they slay
without compunction.
The demon of Spain, burning
with the lust of conquest, drunk
with the blood of its best children,
personified by Pizarro in Peru, 1
and Cortez in Mexico, by treach
ery and by superiority of army, -
by ambush and by outrage, des
troyed the civilization of the Incas s
and ravished the posessions of
Montezuma. Everywhere thea
thought was supreme to win sali
greater realm for the Catholic faith, a
But as always with religion lack- b
ing the true religious elements of i
unselfishness and mercy, it be- a
came a mere cloak for greed and b
wickedness indescribable.
It is safe to say that any nation -
that places its hopes for perma-D
nency upon a misconception of
God's character, is building its
structure upon the sands.
That strange royal pair, *Ferdi
nand and Isabella, combined in a
themse~oves an intense greed for a
gold and a fierce religious iitoler-l
I ance. When their country coruld
produce such devoted servo:uts of
God as Loyola a n11 Saint 'l'hrces:,
1 we must indeed believe there was
depth to the religious feolinl. But
Salso when we consider the servant
of Ferdinand and Isabella, the tierce
- Torquowada, we are compelled to
11 realize that with religion was a
n tremendous admixture of greed.
n After the Inquisition became
thoroughly established, it was
found so easy to secretly dispose
is of men and women of wealth that
)f to Ferdinand, eager for money,
the temptation was too overpow
. ering. So, while Isabella's fanat
ical soul was satisfied with the
;e works of the Holy Office, Ferdi
F- nand found solace to himself in
s, replomshing his treasury. The
it work of the Inquisition became, in
"r short, little else but robbery and
murder in the name of God. If
- the walls of the Escurial could
speak, a cry for vengeance, long
- inaudible to human ears, would
i- stir the human heart. With the
same spirit of lust for wealth, the
' colonies were always regarded as
to fair prey to be mercilessly strip
n ped of everything valuable that
was compact and transportable.
it Precious metals became common
h in Spain, wealth was on every
side, luxury was all perverse. Yet
e in the midst of its greatest mate
.s rial prosperity, the demon of self
r, destruction was unobtrusively at
o work, for any nation that puts its
trust in material wealth for per
' manoncy also builds its structure
e upon the sands.
