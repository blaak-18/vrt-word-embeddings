OT INTEREST TO WEALTH PRODUCERS
THE MAINTENANCE OF EARTH
ROADS.
We may recognize the value of hard
and durable roads in all parts of the
country, but still the fact remains
that for a long time to come the ma
jority of the roads will be composed
of earth. Furthermore, in about nine
months out of the year, the earth
road, if properly cared for, is reason
ably satisfactory. For many agri
cultural districts, it is the only road
at present available. Hence, these
communities should set themselves
seriously to work to learn the best
methods of maintaining earth roads
and of getting the maximum service
from them. Prosperity comes to the
country to a great extent through the
prosperity of the farmers. This fact
strongly suggests the importance of
giving the earth road every possible
care and attention in its location,
drainage, construction and mainten
ance.
An earth road composed of water
holding soil should be exposed to the
sun and air as freely as possible, as
comparison between the shaded and
sunny portions of such a road will
easily indicate. This should be ac
complished by clearing a sufficient
amount of trees and undergrowth
away from the road. It must be re
membered, however, that sandy and
gravelly roads require moisture, and
in these cases some shade should be
retained. Furthermore, trees are
beneficial along river banks and on
steep grades subject to washing.
Drainage is one of the most im
portant points to consider in connec
tion with an earth road. The ma
jority of earth roads in all mountain
ous and hilly districts have too much
drainage. Occasionally a road will be
found with five ditches, three in the
middle made by the horses’ hoofs and
by wheels of the vehicles, and two
on the sides. All well-constructed
earth roads are supposed to have no
more than two ditches, one on each
side of the traveled roadway. Keep
the water out of the middle of the
road by giving it a crown or elevation
in the center of 7 1-2 inches above
the top of the inner slope of the
ditch for a 20-foot road, and where
the hills are a little steep make the
crown 10 inches. With a crown of
about one inch to the foot from the
center to the sides, the ditches which
are often built across the road on
steep grades to deflect the water will
not be needed. Instead of carrying
water across the road in open ditches,
tile or concrete drains should, if pos
sible, be provided. They should have
sufficient capacity and fall to carry
the maximum amount of water that
is expected to flow through them at
any one time. The capacity is in
creased in proportion to the fall or
grade; for instance, 12-inch pipe laid
on one per cent grade will carry 1,800
gallons per minute, while the same
pipe laid on a 2 per cent grade will
carry 2,500 gallons per minute. Fur
thermore, a culvert laid flat will soon
fill up, while one having a good in
cline will keep itself clear.
In the maintenance of an earth
road, avoid the mistake of changing
the natural order of things. Natural
ly the soil is found on top and the
clay on the bottom. If this order is
reversed in constructing a road, the
result will be less satisfactory than
if the soil be left at the top of the
road, for soil makes a better surface
to a road than clay. If the road
bed is largely clay to start with, it
will be well to place sandy soil or
clean sand on top. A covering of 6
to 10 inches of sand upon clay that
persists in breaking up into deep
mudholes will usually be satisfactory,
and if sand enough is added, this clay
will cease to make mud. If the road
bed is composed of sand it can be
improved by an application of clay.
The rule for a serviceable earth
road, then, is as follows: Make ditch
es on each side and keep them open;
haul sand and gravel upon sections
needing this treatment; use a road
machine and a split log drag judi
ciously; follow the “stitch in time”
rule and give an earth road the same
persistent attention you would give
your prize acre, factory or store, and
it will pay as large a profit in propor
tion to your individual outlay.—Cen
terville (Texas) Democrat.
USEFUL SOIL BACTERIA.
A very intimate relation exists be
tween the fertility of a soil and its
bacterial life. It is therefore impor
tant to know the conditions of the
soils which are most favorable to the
rapid development of soil bacteria,
for upon these will depend plant
growth. Acid soils are infertile be
cause the soil bacteria can not grow
in them. Lime, when applied to land,
assists in the decomposition of or
ganic matter in the soil, but indi
rectly. Lime neutralizes the acidity
of the soil and renders it more favor
able to the development of soil bac
teria, which are the true agents for
the composition of organic matter. A
very fertile soil may be so water
logged as to be almost entirely un
productive. Why? The excessive
amount of water cuts off to a large
extent the supply of air which is re
quired by the bacteria. Muck beds
are rich in nitrogen, and often con
tain considerable phosphorous and
potassium, but they will not produce
good crops. Make them a fit habita
tion for soil bacteria, that is, drain
them and correct the acid condition,
and they become heavily productive.
Acids in the soil may also bring into
solution minerals that have a poison
ous effect upon crops, as, for exam
ple, compounds of iron and alumina.
The whole difficulty must be met by
overcoming the injurious effects of
soil acids. But nature has provided a
cheap neutralizer of acid soils.
Lime in some of its forms is the
most economical. It exists in several
available forms. It may be had as
quicklime, hydrated lime, air-slacked
lime, and finely ground limestone
(the unburned rock, finely ground).
It is also contained in shells, marl,
wood ashes, lime-kiln ashes and slag
phosphate, and occurs in combination
with other elements in phosphate
rock. A study of the soil and proper
use of lime in some of its forms, com
bined if necessary with adequate
<sl)c. 'Sftffersonian
drainage, can be relied upon to bring
about a soil condition which will fa
vor the growth of bacteria friendly to
maximum crop production.
It is stated that the territory at
present available for wheat produc
tion, 240,000,000 acres, is capable
with the present average yield per
acre, 12 1-2 bushels, of producing
enough wheat for only 600,000,000
people, assuming the average annual
consumption p*r head to be 4 1-2
bushels. At the present rate of in
crease the population of wheat-eating
inhabitants of the world will reach
this number in 1910; with better
methods of culture and more liberal
use of fertilizers it should be possible
to increase the average yield from
12 1-2 to 20 bushels per acre, but it
is estimated that to do this would
require 12,000,000 tons of nitrate of
soda. Judicious planting of legumes,
which take the nitrogen from the air,
will aid in the increased production
of wheat, and we have no fear that
there will be a famine in either the
grain or nitrogen markets. —Texas
Farmer.
A farmer at Florien, Sabine parish,
tried for twenty years to support his
family on a forty-acre crop. Each
year he come out in a worse condi
tion than he began; so this spring he
resolved to make a living on one acre
of truck and a corn crop. On the
acre he raised 135 bushels of Irish
potatoes, which he sold for 75 cents
a bushel. He then planted it in peas
and raised 20 bushels, which he sold
at $2.50 a bushel.. He now has a fall
crop of Irish potatoes growing on the
land which bids fair to bring him
over S2OO more. His experiment is
not unusual, but happens everywhere
that it is given a trial. —Dodson,
La., Times.
WISDOM FROM THE OKLONA
MESSENGER.
Rake and burn up the rubbish.
That low, wet ground will do well
in Herd’s grass.
Kill a sheep this fall and corn the
meat. It is delicious.
Never feed more to the animals
than they will eat up clean.
Often the pessimist needs a change
of diet as much as anything else.
Keep down the weeds in the fall.
It will lighten the work in the spring.
Pig raising is most successful where
skim milk is a large part of the feed
ration.
Machinery all housed? You can
not afford to let the rust eat out the
lining of your pocketbook.
Irregular feeding is one contribu
tory cause to horses’ acquiring the
habit of bolting their feed.
Put a mulch of strawy manure
around the berry bushes and the
grape vines, but don’t put on too
early.
Your first mistake is excusable,
your second, never; for no man has
any business making the same mis
take twice.
The dairyman’s profits come in dur
ing all the year. That is one reason
why that type of farming is better
than any other.
A good herd of cows of one breed
and in thrifty condition is the best
kind of to the character of
the farmer who owns them.
Colts will not raise themselves. Hit
and-miss methods never yet produced
the best horses. Remember that rais
ing colts pays if you give them intel
ligent care.
Careful feeding can keep up the
milk flow. It does not pay to let it
run down, for once a smaller yield is
established it cannot be increased un
til after another calving.
The cold rains of the fall prove a
great drain upon the vitality of the
live stock. The farmer that does not
provide shelter for the animals is
working against his own interests.
Not only place the farm machinery
under cover, but oil it so that at
mospheric dampness will not rust the
exposed bright parts. A little time
now will save days of trouble next
spring.
A tidbit in the way of a piece of
sugar or an apple will prove ideal in
winning the confidence of the colt.
Always have something for him, and
you will be proud and delighted at the
attention he will shower upon you.
Grade up your dairy cows by using
a pure-bred bull. It may take a few
years to do it, but each year saving
the best of the heifer calves will give
you in time a herd of cows that will
prove far more than your
present herd.
Raise the best crops you can and
sell them at the best price you can,
but don’t speculate. The farmer that
begins to deal on the grain market
has taken his first step to ruin, for
nothing but failure and loss ever came
to the farmer who tried his hand at
the game.
An old swindle that is being tried
on the fanners again is that of selling
them a new and wonderful kind of
wheat and binding them by a con
tract to return to the man (who thus
places them in away to get rich) a
certain number of bushels of the
grain next year. Look out for it.
Sheep that have been a long time
without salt are apt to make them
selves sick eating too much of it when
the opportunity comes. Be regular
in feeding it to them, or, better still,
provide a box to which the flock can
have access at all times. They will
help themselves, and will eat only
as much as is good for them.
