GREAT F'JN IN IT AND OFTEN THE
WORTH OF A LIFE.
How to Float Comfortably For Hour.
In Salt 5Water and to Swlvit on the
lBaeL-t-rln and leg Moie.iments Il
lustrated and Explained.
Personal illstrcltlo illn svilll ning is
worthi all the treatiises ever \\'rittlll on
the sulbject. says a writer In The I1le
signer, who, however, gives the out
lines of some of the simpledust IIlove
ments, auIl(Iung them the following:
One thing which may Ibe asse:rtedl is
that in salt water of tolerable degree
of cnlmnness one umaty he as safe and as
comfortable as tn the downiest bed
ever made if olle but possess colltilente
autticient to lie flat on the bclk, anrms
extended at full length straight out
from the shoulder, with palms down
ward;: legs straight and close together
or the hands clasped beneath the head
and the feet crossel. In this way one
may float for hours, the face being
above the water, so that comfortalle
breathing is possible. This is because
the specific gravity of the human body
Is just about equal to the specific gravl
ty of water.
Only last summer a young woman
who could not swim got out beyond her
depth at one of the leading seashore
resorts and would soon have been
drowned If she had not possessed won
derful presence of mind. Throwing
herself on her back, she floated until
help came to her. If she had been in
fresh water, she could not have remain
ed long on her back, for her legs, being
heavier than the amount of fresh wa
ter they displaced, would have gradual
ly sunk, the lower part of the trunk fol
lowing, until she would have been In
an upright position. Then her head
ia '
would have gradually sunk from its
own weight, and she would have been
obliged to bend it backward to keep
the nostrils and mouth clear for breath
Ing. In this position sa'e woul(l have
been quite as safe if not as comforta
ble as on her back.
The quiet salt water of a bay or inlet
is the safest and pleasantest place to
attempt floating for the first time. One
may float in two and a half feet of wa
ter and may readily regain the footing
by simply putting down the feet and
standing up. Fat people float easier
than thin ones, and women, on account
of the smallness of their bones, float
easier than men.
To float It is only necessary to lie back
ward on the water as one would on an
easy chair or couch, extend the arms
and await results. If the head goes
under for a second or so at first, do not
be alarmed. It will rise at once to the
surface, all the more quickly if the
mouth be kept closed. If one altogeth
er lack confidence sufficient to begin
loating alone, let another bather put a
hand beneath the small of the begin
ner's back. If there be a tendency to
turn in the water, all that is needed to
counteract it is to press down upon the
water with the flat of the hand on the
sinking side. As the ears are general
ly below the water when Boating, a lit
tie cotton should be put in them, and if
the cotton be first dipped in oil it will
all the better resist the entrance of the
water.
Atter onm has become thorougbly o.
a stensed O lying on the back In the
water swimming in this position may
be attempted, first with the arms alone,
then with the legs and arms. The move
ments we will number 1, 2 and 3, and
the bather should count while making
them slowly and evenly, gradually in
nreasing the speed, but keeping them
ilways even and smooth. At 1 carry
:he arms straight above the head, the
hands being slid through the water
arallel with it, so as to offer little re
ilstance. At 2 the hands are turned at
Ight angles to the water and the arms
)rought down straight out from the
shoulders, while at 3 they come down
luite straight at the sides. The posi
ion of the bands is Important, as they
ake the place at the flat part or blade
of the oar in rowing and, while offering
fs little resistance as possible to the
water at the upward stroke of the
trms, should propel the body by press
ng against the water In making the
lownward stroke. If one can only
,eep the idea of rowing in one's mind

riously, draw off the water, wipe every
morsel of salt and ice from the lid, re
iove the dasher and with a spoon pack
the frozen mixture solid. Put a cork
that its perfectly remoe the hole in the
lid and rub with lard the edge of the
cover and the place where It comes.
That precaution allows no salt water
to leak into the frozen mixture. Re
pack the freezer, this time using four
measures of ice to one of salt, and al
low the cream at least one hour to
ripen. Cover it with an old blanket, a
bit of carpet or newspapers.
To serve remove the can. hold It nn
off all the salt and Ice; then place ei
ther on a chilled platter or in small
dishes. In warm weather I usually set
the sherbet cups or ice cream saucers
In the refrigerator before I begin serv
ing a meal in which the Ice forms a
dessert.
There are various things to learn
about creams and ices before freezing
time begins. If you are using a quart
can, never put in more than three half
pints of a mixture. It will increase in
bulk, and overcrowding a can makes a
muss, as well as inviting salt to ooze
in.
To the foregoing, in Good Housekeep
ing, the author appends a simple recipe
for lemon Ice and some further hints,
as follows:
Make a sirup of two cups of boiling
water and one cup of sugar, letting it
boll 20 minutes. When you take It
from the fire, add eight tablespoonfuls
of lemon juice. Allow it to cool, then
freeze.
This ice may be elaborated by dotting
it with slices of banana, Malaga grapes
cut In two and candied cherries.
Orange ice Is made in exactly the
same way, using two cups of water,
one cup of sugar, one cup of orange
juice, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice
and the grated rind of a fine fresh or
ange. By using dark hued blood or
anges you have a delicious pomegran
ate Ice of a hue as lovely as the heart
of a watermelon.

Materials.-No. 70 lace thread, two
shuttles and 15 Inches of No. 2 satin
ribbon.
Begin with the wheel and make it as
follows: 8 p with 2 d s between, close,
tie and cut the thread. Then 2 d a, p,
2 d s, join to p of the ring, 2 d s, p, 2
d a, close, fasten on the second thread
TATTED COLLAR POINTS.
and make a chain of 4 d s, 5 p with 2
d s between, 4 d s. Alternate the rings
and chains until eight of each are
made, joining each :ing to a p of the
center.
Join three of the wheels into a group,
as seen in the Illustration, and in the
space between make a four ringed fig
ure, each ring of 7 d s, 5 p with 3 d s
between, 7 d s, join 3 of the rings to the
chains of the wheels. Make four of the
groups of wheels and join two for each
side of the collar.
Sew the lace to the ribbon, leaving
one inch of space in front between the
sections. Instead of the ribbon a nar
row strip of lawn may be used as a
foundation, or a stock collar of velvet
or silk may be ma,:e and the points
tacked upon It. Cuff points may he
made in the same way as those for the
collar. Knitting silk may be used to,
make the points Instead of thread, and'
the collar and cuffs may then be made
in black or color.
Potato Chowder.
To make a potato chowder boil to-a
gether seven potatoes and three small)
onions, and when they are done rut!
them through a strainer. A quart of
milk should then be sealded aiind a ta-I
blespo3nful of butter added and the po
tatoes s.rred in.
