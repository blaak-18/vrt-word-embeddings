It affords is sincere gratifcation to I
observe the abilty and eaterprise t
displayed by thePeople' Vindiccator, f
of Natbhitoches, of whichbob the on.
J. H. oegrove is editor and proprie. t
tor. The specimen copy of the Fin* -
dicator of theeighteenth lnst., would
do credit to a city many times larger
than Natchitocheo, and compares
favorably with many of the vaunted I
metropolitan weekly journals of the ;
country. It is a larne paper of nine
pages, filled with most Interesting
original and selected matter, and
containg all the news of the day set
forth in most attractive form. The
enlarged edition of the paper is in.
tended as a sample of what the regu
lar Issue will be after the first of
November next, and it is pleasant to
know that the increase in size was
rendered absolutely necessary by he e
increase in business. The energy,
ability and rim which hobracterizes t
the conduct of the Vindicator merits i
the support nwlh h as been s ob ser. '
fully coodedt, both a the parlb:

the fact that It will be to tirdea

tthe Democrat takes a speclal pride '
and measure In the appmearre of
the sndleator, becase we regard It
as ffording Indisputabl evidence of
the growing prosperity of our state,
and of the spirit of pr ogres whlch
is being infused Into Louisiana jour
nallem. C
The Sabine Index also places us
under obligations for its flatterlng n
compliment. We hope our friend ,
steward will reap the reward of his J
industry and energy, in the future *
success of his sprightly little paper:
The Vindicator comes to te this b
week enlarged to eight pages, with
the statement that from and after
November let, this will be Its regular P
size. If the Vindicator was valuable ii
before, it Is now invaluable, and af- i
ter a prolonged battle of seven years
for the supremacy of honesty, econo b
my, intellgece and patriotlsm, and a
a hand to hand fight for reformation ti

Oar lend Pressley, of the Sabine
Bouthron, compliments us in the fol.
lowing paragraph:
The Natblitoohes Vindicator comes g
to us this week enlarged fully dot. a
ble its former size. We note this de. ii
elded improvement of our contempo. b
rary with a great deal of pleasure, ii
as an evidence of the general pros. t.
pority of the country as well as that t
of Its enterprising editor. I
Here is another compliment from
that sprightly and very deserving
paper, The Country Visitor, publish.
ed in New Orleans:
The Peole's Vindicator of the
18th inst., makes its appearance as
an eight page paper, with a supple. I
ment, which Is to be its permanent I
size after the lst of November. The
Vindicator is well edited and we are

city to statesments In Mr. Butler's t
speech which he, Mr. Ogden, hals
thought It neessary to repel ln such s
severe terms. s
The Clalborne Guardian reads the
young men of that parish a telling 1
lecture about learnlng trades. It de- t
plores the want of mecanics In Ho.
mer In the following language:
There are hundreds of young men t
in Clalborne parish who year after q
year seek a place behind a counter t
There are hook agents. peddlers, etc., i
hut none who are trying to learn a
trade that will make them indepen.
dent. The result of all this is that
we have no work done that is worth '
anything. Almost all shoemakers I
ire cobblers, carpentere are butchers,
there are no tallors, and blackamitbh
lame your horses for life. The man
who handles only the saw aze and
plane, and those awkwardly i., be
cause e works cheap, employed in
the place of the cabinet maker.
Houses fall down, bedsteads are of
no accounoo shoss let In water, ol
ns are made with rafters, and there
is nothing that has an merit. But
the worse featreof all is that the rris
lag generation get into a shitlessn
way of extense,-llve from haad to
mouth, and are not to be tralted.
They bave no certain means of Iv
ing and are so dependent that no con
fidence or reliance is to be placed In
them.
We regret to note that, although
Col. Hayes publishes the ion. I.
N. Ogden's card as an advertise.
mont, he simply alludes to it as "by t
way of answer to the speech of Thos. (t
J. Butler." We fear the colonel is P
somewhat Butlerizod.
The Morgan City Review, which j
has been charged by some of our ti
contemporaries with favoring the °
pretensions of Ackleu, comes out, in "
its Issue of the 8sth, with the follow
ing truthful solution of the trouble
between Gen. Billiu, the regular
nominee of the Democratic party of
theThird District, and the disorga.
zer Acklen. As to the result, there ls
no room for doubt: 1
It has seemed all along that it
could not be forgiven Oea. Billiu
that he received the nomination at
the iBrt convention-it was an a -
pardoable sin. But he has now
been for the second time hobsea, and '
has a double claim upon his prt,
which, we are sure, will eheeOb ll
accord him ts full support. That 
party has reat hopes, reeting a onafi
good foundation, but should it suI
ceed only In throwingof Mr. Aeklen
It will feel that a great victory had
been gained. The conduct of the
latter, who seems bent upon rushing
to political ruin, is and must be ut
terly condemned, not only by all
Democrats, but by every fair man.
Dr. J. 1. Cnllea.
It is with heart felt regret that we
noticed In the New Orleans Demo- t
crat the death of the friend whose
name heads this article. Few knew
his benevolent and charitable heart
better than we. The panegyrlo of
the writer in the Democrat is so Jus
