Chicago Special.-Reported here to-day
that a large sum of money had been offered
for thefamous tobacco habit cure called Ito
To-Bac, by a syndicate who want to take it
off themarket. Inquiry at the general offices
revealed the fact that No-To-Bac was not
for sale to the trust at any price. No-To
Bac's success is marvelous. Almost every
Druggist in America sells No-To-l3ac under
guarantee to cure tobacco habit or refund

CORNER CUPBOARDS.
The Style of Forty Years Ago I the itol
Popular Just Ncow.
Corner cupboards are such extrava
gantly popular pieces of furniture just
now that bric-a-brac dealers not only
buy them readily, but send out and
canvass the country in hopes of securing
good specimens.
The style of forty years ago is excel
lent, with small panes of glass fitting
the shelf space, solid brass knob for the
upper door. and brass keyholes in the
lower section . lut they do not always
appear to advantage, because frequent
ly the owner has tried to do the cup
board over herself, and daubed its sur
face over with villainous red paint.
The quality of the wool can be deter
mined by scraping off a little paint. If
it shows a reddish pink it is cherry; if
light colom-it is imitation. The idea is
now to preserve the original design as
nearly :r possible, and to this end little
renovation is made other than polish
ing. The windows are left intact, an
extra band of molding added on the
top and supports placed underneath to
raise it about four inches from the floor.
Claw feet, with a carved apron, sur
mounted by a narrow molding. are a
wonderful improvement without in the
least detracting from the coveted air of
Doing over an old cupboard is very
inexpensive. The article itself costs at
the least from f8 to $140 To polish it
alone amounts to $7 more, and, adding
claw feet and moldings, brings it up to
a total of 8:3. These prices, of course,
depend to some extent on the locality,
I'
A QUAINT 3BIT OF r' i:NITUiPE.
labor being cheaper in some places than
others. In lieu of the claw feet balls
can be used. and, indeed, many persons
prefer not to have them raised at all. "
iodernized cupboard.s are also in de
mand, one of the handsomest being il
lustrated here. The upper door was
resmoved and a shelf cut out, leaving an
open space between the lower and
tipper sections,- and two doors with
large plate-glass panels inclosing the
re:mainion, shelves. The lowver doors
were letft intact, and brass hinges of
elaborate pal tern serve as ornal;ments.
The open space is lined with plate
mitirrors. w-hich reflect its silver and
glacss: contents. The interior is painted
at rich cream tint., against which deli
cate china shows to ladvanltae.
One carver has sent out ten new cup
boards in the las;t two years, princi
pally to inland cities. They have all
,cen dlihcrent in dctaii and splendidly
ha:ndstone specimens. lint. i he old cup
tieard:; can be made equally beautiful
att le":s expe'le, andi fTr some reason
their v,,r.1 age makes them more do
c-ira bl e than the strietly imnod(ern affairs.

THE FARMING WORLD.
KANSAS CHINCH BUGS.
A Simple and Inexpensire Vay of Flgh$
nlg thie est.
A Kansas agricultural correspondent
ays sthat he has just saved 65 acres
of splendid corn flrou the ravages of
the chinch bug by a very simple and
inexpensive expedient. On the east of
his cornfield, and separated from it by
a 10-foot lane, swas a wheat field of 46
acres. Twoor three days be fore cutting
he mixed salt and coal oil in a vessel,
putting from onEf-harf pint to one of
coal oil to one-half bushel of salt. lie
then made a line with thissalt the whole
width of the cornfield (90 rods) through
the center of the li-foot lane. The
line of salt was about : inches wide at
the base. le then bored holes with a
post auger about 3 rods apart, to a
depth of about 8 inches: or a foot. The
top of each hole was rimmued with a
knife leaving the mouth of the hole
funnel-shaped and, s:n ,oth. As soon
as the wheat was cut. about a quart of
water was poured into each hole, nnd
topped with a small quantity of coal
oil. iThe holes were on the side next
to the wheat field, an:l close to the
salt line. As soon as the bugs meet
the salt line they follow it each way
until they come to the holes, into
which they tumble by the thousanrd. As
the .successful experimenter with this
simple trap describes it: T"'hey don't
crawl in the hole. but as soon as they
strike the smooth surface at the top
they lose their first hold and roll over:
and as there is a constant pressure
from the enormous line toward the
hole, they look like wheat going into
a hopper as they pour over the brink."
A boy should be in attenidance on the
line, to dip out the dead bugs before
the hole becomes too foll. and to re
plenish the water and coal oil in the
holes when necessary. A little coal oil
should be poured on the line once a
day, and the line' should be remade
after each rain. The mouth of the
hole should be kept smooth. If it is
dry-and cracked, a handful of dust
should be sprinkled around the edges
occasionally. The bugs cannot cling
to it, and tumble in as soon as they
touch it. "
POINTING PICKETS.

I once had a job of picket-fence mnak

Our stuff was 1'_ by I ' and, a nice
point was wantred, as on A shown in
tihe cut. Carpenters wo,rke-d a whole

with clhisels, dr-awing-knife, pocket

all too slow. I then tnules the tacehine

two men could c.ut aird point over 1,001

and they should be cut very smooth
and true. The upper corners oi tihe
other ends of thie side pi-ece aore sawed

pieces to the bottom, then nuil inch

SMALL. HOG HOUSE.
In Most .laces One Can Bo Built for One
- Hundred Dollars.
A reader wants a plan for a hog
house whecre he can keep four
brood sows and fatten twenty to thirty
younfg hogs in fall and "inter. lie
wants to cook all the food in it and
keep the corn in the second story.
Also he says: "I want to be able to
heat the wat'er here for butchering
time and have the fire safe." Such a
house may be built for a very little
ioney, $100 to $1 t0. accord(ing to price
of lumber in your hlo: lity. The
cheapest will do. This in New Ensir
land will cost 10i to '1S per 1.00); in
Iowa not over Sr to $10. First dig
trenches below friwt death and 1yIV
wall-; for the sills I1x':4 and plan for a 1
plank fl)oor 1 font to I inches al)ove the
ground. Ihave the firs.tst-.ry only high
enough to cle:r a In-ln's lta.l. as it is
warmer in winter. In the nortllhwest
corner have a chimneyt at food cook
er, which will also hieat the water.
IHere is ai ro li sxI1 where the cok- 1
