LIVER PILLS
" FOR THE CURE OF
Repatitis, or Liver Complaint,
DYSPiPSIA AND SICK HIADACHI.
Symptoms of a Dieas Liver.
PAIN in the right side, under the
edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely-able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
b accompanied with a dull, heavy sen.
sation in the back part. There is gen
crally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
j summon up fortitude enough to try it.
, In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
Da. C. MCLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN
CASKS OF AGUE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a PAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.

Where are the braves from the ranks of
the Gray,
Who left happy homes on a bright sun
ny day,
With bearts that beat high for the cause
of the right,
Brace hearts th .t wentfearaleuly forth to
the fight.
Where are the homes bereft of their sires,
The roof-trees thiat sheltered them from
the rude blast,
Where Hope like a Vestal kept kindled
the fires,
TLat hurned in the breast of the Grays
in the past.
Where is the flag that floated so high
And was hailed by the braves with fierce
battle-cry;
Where are the hearts that proclaimed
with one breath,
For the South they'd battle andbleed e'en
to.death.
Gone are the roof-trees; foes levelled 'I
them low,
Hushed are their inmates mute in their t'
woe,
Still, silent, their sires yet glorious in i
death,
And the wallof their orphans the hear- h
ens have cleft. 4
Gone are the ebhieftains whom men fond- ti
ly hailed, p
Low in the dust the banner is trailed, a
Gone are the men who proudly bore, II
The flag of our South, *hich now is no N
more. ti
Are there none left to love the lost cause f
When of her they read, drops tear as .
they panse, y
To ponmer and sigh the pages above, se
And think what might have been in "the ,
land we love."
Come with reverent step to their an
marked grave,
Deck them with flowers from their own
loved earth,
Think how for that land their lives they
gave,
The land of the re that gave them birth.
Green in my heart I will ever retain,
Those who lie low .ond those who remain,
Those who bravely went forth to the
fray,
To rescue our country, I love to this day.
