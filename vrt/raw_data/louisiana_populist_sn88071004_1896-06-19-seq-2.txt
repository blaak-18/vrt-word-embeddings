FRIDAY, June ig, i896,
The Long and Short of It.
The people of this State who
have some share of the stock of
e¶mmon honesty in this world are
asking the Item when the reign of
fraud will come to an end.
We will tell them. There is no
'longer any virtue in laws. We
have to-day the best election sys
tem on the earth. The trouble is
with the men who execute it.
There is but one recourse left
, resort to physical force. No
statutes can prove of any avail.
The trusty Winchester and the ef
fective Colt are worth more than
all the laws in the world. It must
be revolution, or the agents of
fraud will continue doing business
at the okl stand.
This is the long and short of it,
and the sooner we recognize it the
better.-Daily Item.

Fditor LoTisi::na P'opuli't :
I)ear Sir :-Sir lomnlastus Fu
roso in a half (colhm1II editorial in
the Enterpri~P of the 4th inst. with
a11 consider:lable flourish of virtu
ojus(') indignation, calls upon the
undersigned andl two others of this
w ward (5) to expilain how we can
l take the oath (of otilice and still
' colItilet, holnest l el n men with
the courage to express our convic- 1
tions and declare olurselves for an
honest government.
I admit that it will be a pretty
tough job, but, as we were elected
by honest and intelligent white vo
ters, I think it can be "did."
But if it is part of the er'anie
and Statute law that a man 11muI
n pocket his conscience, lay aside his
self respect, close his lips, and be
come a silent accomplice to the
, dastardly fraudis which have been
b perpetrated in the recent election
LN before he can oualify for and till a
Y paltry and insignificant office in
this parish, I for Imy part, want
n "none of it."
lie arraigns myself and others,
and accuses us of being Law-break
ers and Anarchists.
I Let it be understood that this
Entetprising mouth-piece of the
gang, raves without reason, and
falsefies without shame, when he
f speaks of anarchy,
When the Ioard of Supervisors
refused to count the votes of the
qualified electors and refused to al
Slow the ward and Iparish officers
whom we elected by a large majori
3 ty, to take the offices, rightly and
legally theirs, they began the reign
: of Anarchy, because in so doing, I
we are deprived of necessary means
of enforcing the law, and if it fol- 1
lows that we are forced to look
out for ourselves and for each oth
er, who but they are to blame ?
What is an Anachist ? M
One who nullifies the law by
force. Have not the Democrats
by force of their position nullified C
the Constitutional and Statute Paw
by fraudulently manipulating the
election returns of this parish, and
forcing upon the majority, usurp
ers who were not elected, and they
have taken the oath of office.
"Consistency thou art indeed a
virtue."
With a good deal of Democratic c
pomposity and "in the name of I
the LAW &c." he demands that Ia
and others answer certain questions c
which he propounds.
In the first place I deny his t
right to demand any thin. If the I
demands of justice were complied ,
with, where would he be t echo ,
answers, where I but the allpower- t
ful arms of the ring around him, t
mad he is protected from the same t

The resolutions advise the hon
est voters to iemand th'se inalien
ahle and indisputable rights given
them lby the Constitution, and
nothin_, more.
lie then rears himself back on
his dignity, and in a tone of injur
ed innocence inquires how we, the
elected candidates to the offices in
ward 5, in the face of all this can
come to Natchitoches and take the
oath of office which binds us to up
hold the Laws and Constitution of
the State.
That can best be answered by
asking him if he did not take the
oath as a Federal officer with the
undried gore of a human being on
his hands, shot down in cold blood,
like a (log, by himself and others
whom he had armed ? and whether
he and an acconiplice did not in
April of 1S9, defraud the same
man u ha:,m he now eulogizes as a
"sterling Democrat," viz: b. )D.
McEnery, of forty or fifty votes
by stuffing the ballot box at Hor
ton's in this ward, his name being
on the fraudulent tickets as candi
date for Clerk against flyams.
Query, wculd he have qualified
had hesucceed in being counted in ?
That's felony and can be proved
by several eye witnesses, a crimin:al
before God and man, if not under
the LAW of Natchitoches parish.
Further, is he not aware that a
certain "Stalwart" who took a
prominent part in the late steal was
accused of stealing stock, and es
caped, the Lord and the Ring only
knows how.
And that the last mentioned par
ty is a confessed ballot box stuffer,
having boasted to parties in this
ward how he and another Commis
sioner of election in a bygone elec
tion took the ballot box home with
them and voted all night, fixing
the poll list and tally sheets to suit
themselves, made oath to and sign
ed them.
That's perjury, and perjury is a
crime. Still this man holds an of
fice alnd took an oath to support
the Constitution and LAWS of the
State.
Again is he not aware that it has
been proven that the late Attorney
General of the State, a resident of
the city of Natchitoches, and a
bright and shining light in the
State and local ring, has been guil
ty of the most shameful political
deals, (vis, $879 60) against the
Peace and Dignity of the State,
and so on, Ad libitimm, ijAnita. et
Yet these men have all taken the
oath of office, pledging themselves
to support the Constitution and
LA WS of the State, and still there
was no "kiok."
You msee there is a ditincotion
with a difbrence between a mem
bar of the Ring and a "Wildeyed
Pop."

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White 1House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Shoeld Read It.
It contains 176 paes of laugh
provoking matter, and 40 full-page
illustrations of Cleveland as a
tramp.
