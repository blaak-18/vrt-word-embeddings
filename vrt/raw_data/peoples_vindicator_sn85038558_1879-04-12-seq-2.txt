We desire is our bumble capacity
to impres one of these truths upon

Guardinm Suffrage.
It should not be understood that
we contend for other than strict
g Democratic principles when we in
sist that proper and healthful safe
. guards should be placed arou;nd the
inestimable privilege of suffrage;
t" when we insist that mankind shall
not exercise a right--however ruch
it may be a right, to a vicious purpose
e and destructive end.
r All oxcesses, whether in gover
ir meat or In civil life, are baleful
. none more s than that which broke
down all barriers of restraint and
Submerged long established precepts
a and well ordered political sodety
with a mass of voters, ignorant of the
very forms of the government they
assumed to dictate and in no way
connected-neither by community of
Sfeeling, interest or race--with those
citizens to whose valor free citizen
ship in Ameriaes owed its origin, to
whose virtue the United States owe
p their glory and prosperity.
To contend, that because a male
biped of the bohuman species, 21 years
- of age, shall vote for that reason and
r that reason alone; that, ignorant and
r depraved, il we know they ean be or
,f become, numbers alone shall rule
a without regard to the bet whether
P they role Intelligently or by passion
or prejudice, is, in our opinionm, to
formulate a doctrine, which must, in
a the end, subvert the very purpose of
- civic society.
r There most, in our opinion, be
Ssome qualificatio other than nature
a necessary before this great boon, this
honorable privilege should be exer- 1
b cised. Our forefathers contended that
a no man should be allowed to take
a part in the affairs of government
Ssave those who had community of
I purpose and interest, and we have
t been most firmly impressed by their
views.
I O.r Commonwealth presents a
field well adapted for the work of
I statesmen and the protection suffrage
r demands from vicious and depraved
tendencies and surroundings is not
r by any means the smallest. Georgia
has, with other States, adopted the
"poll tax qualifications," for which
we contend, and we see no reason
why, if it works there with so much
eharm, it should not be put in prac. c
ties here through our Constitution.
At all events, let us have some pro t
tection for a virtuous ballot from
those who vote upon the dictates of
their depraved passions or at the 14
beck and demand of corrupt leaders, t
beat on corrupt purposes.

in- now echoing the cry that Congress is

the a now rebellion is made the theme
e; with which it is hoped the country
all may be startled into reaction in fa
ich vor of despotism after so long a strug
gle for its overthrow and at the mo.
meat when its destruction has been
._ reached.
The hopes of the votaries of power
ke will be blasted.
mad Americans hold in dear remember
ptsance that precious word and that
sty dear-bought right, the foundation of
the our Constitution, the corner stone of
Iey our liberties-revolutioU.
Ay Freedom is born alone of revolt.
of It may be through seas of blood, or by
m civil means. But tyranny buhas never

ing numbers whom it would be mad
ale oes to resist.
ars The people of this Union who
,ad love liberty better than they do par.
, ty ; who venerate the coanstittion
or which was the result of a gigantice
ule and bloody revolt, know full well
her that neither would exist a moment
Ion after the will to maintain either at
to every cost had ceased to be their
in purpose. They know that fIr nine
of teen years the "forms of law" have
undermined the principles which sup.
be port both these cherished objects and
are to yell "down the wind" as revola.
his tion the attempt of their chosen re
r- presentatives to destroy that power
hat which if left at work must destroy
them-is to Insult their understand,

of We have reached in our history an
epoch and an issue, by no means the
sir Irst, and will by no means be the
last, which ealls for no little of that
patriotic virtue that animates none
a but those who know their rights and
knowing dare maintain them.
ed National quarantine.
ot It is a startling fact that in New
p Orleans the most blatant and rigid
advocates of a National Quarantine
ch are those who bitterly oppose any ef
fort of the State to exclude vessels i
and persons from West Indian and
South American ports during the
summer months. We are sure that
this "wood pile" contains a "nigger"
of no mean proportion. The "busi.
ness interest" of the country have
long since learned that they can eon. I
" trol the government of the Union
more readily than that of she States,
and we venture the assertion that if
our Congressmen were sueeh annies,
S(whichb we do not believe) as to enact
Isuch a vieouse thing as a "National
t Quarantin Law" the health of the
rwhole country' would be a so.
m condary matter. First trade, then
and then very seldom, health.
In proof of this we eite the faet '
that the "implication invoked for '
