JOSEPH'S FOOT-WASHING.
*.
The Carious Ceremony of Holy Weet
in Vienna.
r On Holy Thursday, at Vienna, the
e Emperor Francis Joseph performed the
a annual ceremony of washing the feel
of twelve old beggars, says the New
a York Sun. The ceremony took place in
L- the hall of ceremonies in the imperial
h palace. On a platform raised slightly
s above the floor was a long table with
twelve covers, a plate, knife, wooden
spoon, folded napkin for each, with a
piece of bread, a pewter mug, and a
a little blue pitcher filled with water. At
10 o'clock, twelve old men, the young
est 89 and the oldest 96, entered the hall
and were supported, each by two rela
l tives, to the platform, which they
mounted with difficulty, and were
pa placed in their seats, their relatives.
I most of them women, standing behind
them. Then entered twenty knights of
the Teutonic order, headed by their
master, Archduke Eugene, dressed in
white with long black crosses on the
ibreasts of their doublets and others on
the back of their long black cloaks.
They marched around the hall, and
then, forming a line on either side,
made way for the ministers, with Count
Kalnoky at the head, and the em
peror's staff. They were followed by
the primate of Austria, Cardinal
Gruscha, with priests and acolytes
bearing candles and burning incense.
'rheit came the emperor, dressed in the
white uniform of an Austrian general
and wearing the order of the Golden
Fleece. He advanced to the table and
addressed a few words to the old men.
At a signal from the master of cere
monies twelve guardmen stepped for
ward, each bearing on a tray the first
course of the sumptuous repast; the
emperor now took off his helmet,
gave it to an officer, and, passing down
the line, arranged the dishes before the
guests. Twelve archdukes then ap
proached and removed the Barmecide
banquet from the guests eyes, handing
the dishes to the guards. This was
repeated for three courses, and with
the last, the plates, knives and other
objects on the table were also taken
off. They were all packed later, with
the food, in wooden boxes, and sent
to the homes of the old men. The
table was then taken away, and the
"washing of feet" began. A priest ap
proached with a towel and golden
basin full of water; their slippers were
taken from the old men's feet, and the
emperor, on his knees, beginning with
the oldest, moistened his feet with
water and dried them with the towel.
Without rising, still on his knees, he
passed on to the next one, and to on
to the end of the row. When he had
finished he rose and placed around each
man's neck a chain, attached to which
was a small white bag containing thirty
pieces of silver. That ended the cere
mony; the emperor and his suite with
drew, and the old men were taken home
by their friends.
A COUPLE'S ADVENTURE.
Short at Funds, but the geatlemea Was
an Able Financier.
Among the throng on bicycles speed
ing between Ridgewood and Tuxedo
on Saturday afternoon were a little
couple not yet in their teens, says the
New York Sun. The little lady manip
ulated the wheel to perfection, and as
they passed along they looked even
more interesting than the beautiful
country about them. They had halted
at Ramsey's, had cream and confec
tlonery, and had resumed their trip
when rain began to fall. Here was a
dilemma the youth of 11 had not cal
culated on. Rain meant railroad fare
back to Ridgewood, for in no elrcum
stances could the young lady be allowed
to get wet. They hastened to the first
railroad station. The youth saw the
wheels housed and then fished in his
pockets for funds. The little treat at
the saloon had absorbed nearly all his
cash, but he arose to the occasion and
in a confidential way whispered to the
ticket agent that if two could ride on a
whole ticket that cost les than two
half tickets he thought he had sum
cient funds to buy one. Then, to his
dismay, the lad discovered he was 2
cents short even of the price of one
whole ticket. He so informed the
agent and asked for credit for that
sum, promising to reimburse him at
another time. The agent looked at the
worried face of the little girl and hand
ed him out a ticket.

:h It was during a recent conversatlon

,y "Just ten years ago," said he. "my
wife noticed a small lump in her breast.
She thought nothing of it. but it in
creased in size rapidly, and soon broke
d through the skin, and commenced to
)f discharge. She was put under treat
ir ment of the best physicians, but they

B had died with cancer, and when ap
d prised of this fact, the doctors thl me
e, that they would not attempt to save
it her; that she was incurable. Although
i the cancer had by this time become
d ep seated, and her health very low,
I had one of the most noted specialists
of New York to treat her. After treat
S ing her awhile, this doctor admitted
* that the case was hopeless and further
e treatment useless. It is diffic.ult to
it imagine how despondent we all be
n came, knowing that she must die, and
d unable to give her any relief. I had
spent over five hundred dollars with
the best medical skill to be had, and
felt that there was r;o further hope.
"One day I happened to read an ad

of the failure of the most eminent
physicians in the country, I confess I
had little faith left in any human
agency. However, I purchased a bot

a seemed to benefit her; after she had
6 taken a couple of bottles, the cancer
a began to heal, and astonishing as it
may seem, a few bottles more cured her

derstand how remarkable this cure was
when I explain that the cancer had
eaten two holes in the breast two inch
es deep. These healed up entirely, and
e although ten years have elapsed, not a
a sign of the disease has ever returned,
and we are assured of the permanence
of the cure, which we at first doubted.
"I certainly regard S. S. S. as the
most wonderful remedy in the world,
and it is truly a God-send to those

NOT SO VERY POOR.
The Man trom New Zealand Had S0SO@0
in His Waisteoat.
Over two weeks ago W. B. Nicholson
of New Zealand arrived here on the
steamer Mariposa, hnd put up at the
American Exchange hotel, says the San
Francisco Examiner. He was so
roughly dressed and so unique in ap
pearance, with a queer bunch of whis
kers on his chin, that he seemed a
e walking advertisement of hard luck.
- He had arrived in the steerage, and he
a took one of the very cheapest rooms
1 in the house. Under these circum
r stances Manager Wiseman was in
clined to keep a wary eye on him. At
the end of three days Mr. Wiseman
broached the idea of settling his bills.
The queer guest said he would pay the
a bill in the next day or two. He did not,
however, and he was spoken to again
- about it. Still there was a hitch, but
r finally the New Zealander said he would
go upstairs and get the money. After
2 a while he came down with it and
paid the bill. Then he explained that
the reason why he hadn't paid it before
was that he had all his money sewed up
in his vest. On investigation it was
shown that he had a surprising
amount. There was no less than $5,000
in bills and English sovereigns, mostly
the latter, besides $4,000 in drafts. The
I sovereigns weighted the vest down till
r it was as heavy as the owner, and all
an able-bodied man could carry. They
were skillfully and stoutly sewn in from
the bottom up, so that all around his
sides and front there was money, and
I the back of the vest had to be strength
ened with leather straps to keep the
garment from being pulled to pieces.
r This queer contrivance, loaded with
coins, bills and drafts, the man with
the billy-goat whiskers had been lug
sging with him wherever he traveled.
There were fears at times that he
would be robbed, but Nicholson has al
ways insisted that he could take care
of himself. A few days ago, after re
turning from a warm walk down town
with his load of cash, he threw off
his heavy vest in his room and put an
another one to cool off. He finally
stepped down stairs, leaving the door
open. He sat at a desk for a long time,
forgetting about his cash. Suddenly
he recollected it, his face assumed an
ashen hue, and he vanished upstairs
like a streak of light. His precious
vest was there, though, hanging on a
chair. He grabbed it and put it on,
and since then has worn it constantly.
Nicholson came over to invest his mon
ey, but did not find anything to suit
him, so the land of the aftipodes will
get him again. He sailed on the Mari
posa, the same steamer on which he
came.
A GOOD GOBBLER.
ThIs Tender-Hearted Old Turkey Cared
for Chicks as If They Were His Own.
A lady of Philadelphia owns an old
turkey gobbler which deserves to go
on record as a feathered philanthropist.
Some time last fall a hen inhabiting
the same fowl yard as the old gobbler
in question had the misfortune to be
caught by a hawk and left to the cold
charity of the world a couple of baby
chicks that had not shed their first
down. For the first day of their grief
the little fellows peeped around in de
spair and almost died, of starvation.
None of the hens seemed inclined to
throw the protecting wing over their
helplessneap, and it is probable that the
next day would have ended their career
had not the old gobbler come manfully
to their rescue. With a gentleness
that would have done credit to a ten
derer nature he considered their help
less condition, and began at once to
provide for the wants of the little or
phans. It was really beautiful to be
hold his kindly care of the children
of his adoption. He learned to suit his
pace to theirs, accommodating himself
to their feeble ability in every partlyu
lar. He taught them to scratchi and
pick as patiently as their own mother
would have done, and actually har
bared them at night until they were
able to roost unsheltered. During the
bitter cold winter, though they were
by that time well-grown pullets, he 0on
tinued to care for them, sheltering
them from the wind and guarding
them from the wet, though he had to
suffer himself in their stead.
