Ilundrel Are Dead.
DETAILS YET BRIEF.
The Property Lois Is Nut as Great as
First Irportsd--Several Days
More Before Accurate News
Can Be Obtained.
Blneflold, W. Va., J.uno 2.-Further
details of the fearful fleod in the Poca
hontas Flat Top coal region show that
50 dead bodies have been found. Thoun
sands of people are homeless and it is
feared are without food, or at the best
with only food enough to last at the
most only a few days.
The damage from flood in the Kansw
ha valley will reach $100,000. Houses,
barns, fences, crops and trains of cars
on coal roads were washed away.
At Boomer, 23 houses were wrecked.
The cloudburst occurred near the
headwaters of the Elkhorn and Dry
Fork river, which is the confluence near
Welch from the main Tug river.
The Elkhorn follows the Norfolk and
Western railroad for o0 miles and it is
reported that for 10 miles the road is
wrecked. Along the coal regions of the
.lkhorn and the big lumber plants low
er down were swept away in the bruis.
Ing flood and are lodged along the
streams against the rugged mountain
aides. Many of the cars were loaded
and with their cargo are practically a
total loss.
All the lumber plants are great losers
to an extent of $1,000,000.
At lager station the river rose to the
immens height of 81i feet inside of three
hours, deluging every house in the lit.
tle town and washing away many of
the outbuildings In some instances
dwellings were swept from their foun
dations but lodged along the river
against larger and more sabstantial
ones, and were thus saved from destruc.
lion.
At Vivian many houses were washed
away and several lives reported lost.
It is safe to asy that less than
100 persons have perished. Much live
stock has been drowned. Among the
Irift and debris which fills the river
ire numbers of horses, cattle and hogs.
Several horses with saddles and bri
Iles were seen to float by, rendering it
probable that the riders had either been
lrowned or hae been compelled to de
mero them and flee to the monatain side
or safety.
