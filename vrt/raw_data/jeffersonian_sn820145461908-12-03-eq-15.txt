deed, standing there, especially as
little (Simpson, who stood back of
her, had brought her two or three
white roses which were tucked in her
belt.
11 Annie—” Snodgrass began bro
kenly, 11 Annie—”
“Hush!” she said, drawing him
into the room. “Jimmy is sleeping
like an angel. And—and you never
told me that I was dear to you. But
you have always meant much to me.
And your mother has been here and
told me what you said to her today—
about a daughter-in-law. She guessed
the truth at once.”
The world became a great blur to
Snodgrass. He knew that Annie’s
hand was placed in his; that little
Simpson asked him questions and
helped him with the answers.; that
Annie answered similar questions.
“I pronounce you man and wife!”
It was little Simpson’s voice. “I
pronounce you man and wife!”
Everything cleared up at those su
preme words. Little Simpson had
thought it was his own marriage he
arranged for in the morning; his
mother had thought it was his own
wife he meant when he spoke to her
about a daughter-in-law. And An
nie? Yes, Annie loved him and had
taken it for granted that it was her
wedding and his that he had insisted
should be solemnized that 'afternoon.
Her hand still in his, he noticed a
shambling young form in the room —
Jimmy.
“Mammy Annie,” said Jimmy,
“am I going out?”
“Going out!” cried Snodgrass.
‘ ‘ Hear that now! But you ’re coming
in again. You ’re never going to leave
Mammy Annie nor —nor Daddy Bob.”
He laughed aloud as he had laugh
ed in the monring when he waited for
his breakfast and his mother accused
Flanagan in consequence of it.
“Little Simpson!” he said, “Jim
my! Annie!” and the tears would
run down his cheek; “Annie, am I
the one that’s to save you? Annie,
my wife!” —The National Magazine.
RAISE THE PRICE OF EVERY
THING.
After waiting until after election
railroad officials are announcing an
increase in freight rates. Their theory
is that when the volume of business
is heavy, freight rates should be
raised under the workings of the law
of supply and demand. When busi
ness falls off and there are hundreds
of thousands of empty cars, the
freight rates should be raised because
dividends cannot otherwise be sus
tained.
This is similar to the theory of the
Sugar Trust at the tariff hearing.
The consumption of sugar has in
creased, which the trust asserts is
proof that the tariff is not excessive
and if anything should be raised. If
the consumption of sugar had dimin
ished, the trust could likewise make
the argument that this showed the
necessity for more protection to pay
dividends on the capital invested.
The advance in freight rates will be
paid by the consumer. The tariff on
sugar is paid by the consumer. Every
increase in price is paid by the con
sumer. It is his function to pay for
other people’s prosperity.—New York

JOHN SHARP WILLIAMS’ BREAK.
“Personally I do not regret the re
election of Mr. Cannon,” said John
Sharp Williams in New York last
week. This is a statement that his
Mississippi friends cannot appre
ciate. Further in the same interview
Mr. Williams said: “If I were asked
to name two Republicans whose per
sonal integrity could be counted on
in all cases I would name‘Thomas B.
Reed and ‘Uncle Joe Cannon.’ ” By
the eternals, two of the meanest men
that have lived since John Sherman.
What motive can lead a patriotic
Mississippian to rejoice in the elec
tion of a man who is opposed to the
construction of the Panama Canal and
the deep waterway through the Miss
issippi Valley; a man who is owned
and controlled by the Whisky Trust
and who would like to have an open
saloon on every cross-roads in the uni
verse; a man who blocks and abso
lutely ties up legislation intended for
the common good of eighty million
people; a man who will not recog
nize a member of Congress upon the
floor without first asking the permis
sion of the corporate interests that
own him. Mr. Cannon is today the
most baleful influence in American
politics, and in the~ interest of com
mon justice to the people he ought to
be banished bodily from the face of
the earth. —Southern Sentinel, Ripley,
Miss.
PROBABLY SHE MEANT IT.
Lucile, a carefully brought-up lit
tle girl of five years, returned from
her first party in great glee.
“I was a good girl, mamma,” she
announced, ‘ ‘ and talked nice all the
time.”
“Did you remember to say some
thing pleasant to Mrs. Townsend just
before leaving?” her mother asked.
“Oh, yes, I did!” was the enthu
siastic reply. “I smiled and said,
‘I enjoyed myself, Mrs. Townsend; I
had a lots better dinner than I
thought I’d have.’ ”
