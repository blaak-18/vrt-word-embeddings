Our “Post-Card Club
Here is something to make you
think, whether it hurts you or not;
something to stir you up and make
you do your very best. I want let
ters from you all on this importantsub
jeet, and especially from the young
men of about 14 or 15, who are just
learning how to look comfortable in
a high collar on Sundays, and are be
ginning to examine with anxiety the
stray hairs on their upper lips; and
from the young ladies of about 14
or 15, who have just had another tuck
let out of their frocks —I beg their
pardon—dresses, and are reading the
latest poetry on ‘‘Spring,” and look
ing over their left shoulders at the
rats and puffs and things that the
boys don’t know about until later in
the game.
And from the little children, too.
Some of the best letters I have ever
seen were from kids of 8, 9 or 10-;
and I am sure that whatever they
have to say on such a subject as this
will be worth hearing. Remember the
old song, and then go ahead and write:
Sugar and spice and everything nice;
That’s what little girls are made of.
Snaps and snails and puppy dogs’
tails;
That’s what little boys are made of.
Now for the subject.
What Girls Think of Boys.
For the best letter, written by a girl
under 15, not containing more than
70 words, on the subject of “Boys,”
we will give a pretty gold ring, set
with pearls.
What Boys Think of Girls.
For the best letter, written by a boy
under 15, not containing more than
70 words, on the subject of “Girls,”
we will give a complete baseball outfit
—bat, ball, glove and all the rest of it.
Conditions.
You must write the letter yourself,
without any help, and you must give
your full name, address and age, which
will not be counted in the 70 words.
You can be sentimer tai or funny, lack
adaisical or mean, magnanimous or se
vere. Write just what you think, and
put it in your own words.
Some More Jokes.
Clyde Lindsay, of Wrightsville,
Ga., 14 years old: One day an Irish
man’s house caught afire, and in the
excitement he put on his trousers hind
side in front, and then jumped out of
the second-story window. Friends
rushed in and picked him up, asking:
“Are you hurt, Pat?” Pat looked
down at his trousers, and exclaimed:
“No, begorra; I’m not hurt, but I’m
fatally twisted.”
A Mule’s Anecdote.
Walker Hogan, Agnes, Ga., 12 years
old: Less than one hundred years ago,
a bashful boy called on his best girl,
and, to pass the time, he said, ‘ 1 Let’s
tell some tales.” His girl was a col
lege girl and corrected him, telling him
to say “anecdotes” and not “tales.”
Soon after this his mule, hitched at
the gate, began to rear and kick, and
he went out to look after him. When
he returned to the parlor, his girl
asked him what was the trouble. 1 ‘ Oh,
nothing,” he said, “only the cow was
chewing off my mule’s anecdote. ’ ’
By Daddy Jim.
Origin of the Hen.
Carl Lawhorn, Buena Vista, Ga.: I
am a little boy eight years old. Papa
takes the Jeffersonian, and thinks it
is the best paper he ever read. Here
is my joke. “Which did de Lawd
make first, Brudder Johnson, de hen
or de egg?” “De hen, ob cose; de
egg comes from de hen.” “Yaas, but
de hen comes from de egg, too.”
‘’Now, lookee heah, Brudder Johnson,
if de Lawd made de egg first, he’d
have had to make an incubator to
hatch it, a sawmill to get de wood for
de incubator, a tin mine for de tin, a
cotton mill for de cotton batting, a
drug store for de ’mometer, besides
gettin’ de permission of some walking
delegate to operate dem industries,
and takin’ chances on de egg hatchin’
ait dat. No, no, Brudder Johnson, de
Lawd simply made a hen first, and I
reckon he didn’t make a colored man
in a year or two after.”
Two Subscriptions.
Georgia Hurt, of Hiram, Ga.; 17
years old, sends us two subscriptions,
and writes: I read the Weekly Jef
fersonian and also Watson’s Maga
zine, but like the Weekly best. I
have a brother named for Mr. Wat
son. His name is Paul Watson. Hope
I shall live to see Mr. Watson presi
dent.
No Paper Like It.
Bessie Haslerig, LaFayette, Ga.: I
am a little country girl eight year's
old. My school was out the last of
March. Papa takes the Jeffersonian,
and thinks there is no paper like it.
I like to read the letters.
Will Exchange Post Cards.
Henry Douglas, Maben, Miss. :
Papa subscribed to the Jeffersonian
about three weeks ago. I enjoy read
ing the children’s page very much. I
attended a debating society for some
time, and we sure had jolly times, but
as it is time for the farming people to
get to work, the debate was stopped.
I joined the Farmers’ Boys’ Corn
Club, and hope to win the prize. I
attend Sunday school every Sunday,
and think it is a grand thing for the
children and also grown men and wo
men. How many of you have been go
ing to school? I have and like it fine.
Gur school was out a month ago. I
would be pleased to exchange post
cards with you all. Will answer all
I receive.
Our Magazine Club.
In the next number of Watson’s
Jeffersonian Magazine we will give a
page or two for the children, and if
any little Jeffs want to write us some
nice short letters we will publish
them. The letters for the magazine
club must be marked “Magazine” at
the top. We will also publish one or
two pictures of children each month;
so, if you haven’t too many freckles,
send your picture.
An Indiana Boy.
Here is a letter which came in at
the last minute: “I am a little boy
eleven years old. My father lives on
a farm in the country. He takes both
Jeffersonians. I like to read the let
ters in the Jeffersonian. This being
the first letter I ever wrote, I will
close. Best wishes to Daddy Jim.

SUMMARY OF EVENTS.

Law. that incomes as low as
1,500 francs ($289.50)
per year are subject to taxation. In
America, an income under $5,000 a
year would in all probability not be
subjected to any duty and the obvious
fairness of allowing the poor and the
citizens of small yearly earnings ex
emption from this form of taxation
until he had arrived at the comfort
able point of $5,000 a year should
surely commend itself to every honest
citizen. Just ho\v an income tax can
be called “class legislation” is bard
to see since it affects no one particu
lar occupation or kind of citizen, but
merely assumes that all citizens who
have sufficiently succeeded, under the
laws and opportunities of their land,
in achieving substantial financial suc
cess, should be willing to give a small
per cent of their yearly increase to
maintain a government which protects
them in the enjoyment of their
wealth.
Great Britain has sailed in to the
arena of taxation and is handling
everything and every-
England’s body without gloves.
Tax Budget. Dispatch from London
says that the “burden of
the $78,810,000 deficit for the fiscal
year, due to old-age pensions and the
race with Germany for Dreadnaughts,
is placed upon accumulated wealth
and ‘the trade’ as the liquor business
is popularly called, in the Liberal
Government’s budget” and that the
wealthy classes are already crying:
“Socialism and confiscation!” In-
liquor, tobacco, and inheri
tances are to be more heavily taxed
and stamp taxes laid upon land trans
fers and stock transactions. The bill
has not become a law, and must pass
the House of Lords before it could
do so, but it indicates the trend. If
the rich are saddled with the burden
of militarism and imperialism, maybe
there will be less halting on the way
to universal reduction in armies and
navies.
Tennessee has done .tardy justice to
her citizens in buying Reelfoot Lake

Public. tragedies in the Reelfoot
region occurred. The trou
ble had been brewing for thirty or
forty years but the sapient legisla
tures could not realize it until one
man was illegally murdered and his
slayers are to be put to death in a
decorous, legal manner —unless the
Governor commutes the sentence.
Pardons and commutations, how
ever, do not issue so promptly in such
cases as where finer clay is
Taylor concerned. The recent par-

Powers, after having been convicted
as an accessory before the fact. Will
son is the Governor who was rampant
to uphold law and order in connection
with the night-riding in the tobacco
reg-ions of his State, but he is a Re
publican first when it comes to crim
inality higher up. To pardon these
fugitives before they had ever been
brought to any trial at all, is a slap
in the face of decency and justice, it
matters not whether they were inno
cent or guilty of connivance at the
murder of Governor Goebel. Certain
ly a conspiracy existed to remove a
powerful rival of Governor Taylor.
And certainly Governor Willson has,
by his high-handed individual act, re
moved all possibility that any future
confession or revelation could jeopar
dize these suspects. It may quiet
“ Goebellism ” and it may tranquillize
politics, in Kentucky, but the burning
of Willson in effigy by friends of Goe
bel doesn’t bear him out in the yea
son he alleged for his conduct. It
does not usually tranquillize a peo
ple when the governor of a State sub
ordinates the ends of justice to par
tisan politics, as the Republican gov
ernors of Indiana and Kentucky have
done in the present case.

move those inequalities of fortune
which give to one mother so much su
perfluous luxury, while another is
chained to a dreary treadmill of toil,
or to a deprived, sacrificial existence.
Perhaps, above everything, it should
cause humanity to realize more clearly
the cruelty implied by orphanage and
resolve to make the motherless the
objects of its especial interest and
love.
If these influences be paramount
on Mothers’ Day, then it will prove a
magic key that will unlock the most
sacred impulses of the human heart
and throw rich treasures open to an
holy usage.
