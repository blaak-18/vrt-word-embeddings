What is, and What Should Be.
The secret of the success of politi
cal parties is not so much a secret af
ter all, to those who choose to ac
quire the knowledge of the causes
that lead to such success.
We hear it said, tand with much
truth, that the Democratic party can
not succeed upon investigations and
exposures of the fraud and pecula
tions of the Republican party alone.
These may, and no doubt do, set
Speople to thinking but that large
o mnass of the population, that hope and
look for good government, must be
assured that the party exposing fraud
a will do something better than the ex.
of posed. In other ~t rds, all thinkers
now see that this stealing and plun
dering-these rings and cliques, are
'' but the natural result of a party yor
Sernme't, and naturally inquire before
electing a new party to power, if they
intend also to administer the gov
a ernment in the same way as those
ousted. The spitit of this govern
m ent is undoubtedly good-its theo y
splendid, but, unfortunately, that
spirit has not emulated parties since
the advent of Jackson, as President,
e and the theory is not yet, after one
° hundred years, had a practical trial
or been demonstrated to a practical
satisfaction or solution. This Repub
lic is certainly one of the people, and
intended to benefit the greatest nunm
her, without, however, depriving the
few of life, limb or property. The
cursed party rule is the bane under
which we have suffered and now
groan ; to make itsetlf immortal, we
contend the Democracy has never
had a finer opportunity. Our suc
cess, therefore, as a party, depends
upon how near its principles approach
the great wants of the people. In
other words, the work of investiga
tion and exposure go far to show the
pernicious .folly of party rule--the ab
. solute destruction that must follow
t its reign; then the Democracy must
not only promise a people's govern
ment upon sound constitutional prin
ciples, but must nominate such a man
as its presidential candidate as will
c make those promises a surety.
To our mind, the road to victory is
eclear. We have but to enunciate
sound political dogmas-declare for
hlard money ; revenue tariff; honesty,
intelligence and capability, the test of
Sofficial preferment; and home rule
e and then nominate such men as will
make this paper promise mean whlat it
,.says; victory is certain. Is there
brains enough among us to do these
things? Certainly, yes. But we con
sider it the duty of our leaders to
crush down such men as would rush
us off to side issues-the Blaines, and
Ben Hills, should not be suffered to
I deviate us as a party, from thle road
to aRl; goat, WIhich once renot.od, *.il
give assurance of peace and prosperi
ty to our now distracted eountry.
S The loss of thle control of this
government by the Democracy pre.
vious to our late war, was the aban
Sdonment of a line of patriotic prin
ciples, founded upon the thleory of
Sour constitution and the spirit of
Repnblican principles, for such ab
stracts as slavery in the Territories,
" and this divergence in thle canvass led
1 to a submerging of all other ideas,
all other questions in C(ongress, and
, finally, to secession, war, subjugation
and reconstruction.
Fromn them we have just emerged
is it patriotic and wise to repeat the
i sad lesson of "abstrcnetism," or shall
a we cling to principles more firmly
Sthan ever, thereby profiting by those
Slessons taught at such fearful cost.
SA people's government is what is tow
Simperatively demanded-the Repub
lican party cannot gire it to us; will
the Democracy do it ? ***

Front tho Post-office, we received,
last week, a small package done up
in soiled brown paper, with a dingy,
dirty stump on it, and opening it, we
found a copy of the Vindicator, mark.
I ed on the margin in scarcely legible
letters "Returned." Tlhiinking we
had inadvertently mailed our paper to
some recent Radical convert, we be
came cnrious to see what might be
his name, and looking farther we
cante across it--C. Beck, Fort Jessup,
was the Post-office address, and C.
Beck was the man who returned our
paper. He is the only one, however,
who has done it.
We hav just read A . H. Leonard's
letter to the Shreveport Times, on the
"political situation," wherein he pro
poses to invent a "new party" and
take charge of it himself. It is about
the weakest thinig we have met with
in a long time, and we predict it falls
still-born, by its own inherent weak
ness. The press throughout tile State
should pass it over in silence, leaving
it to die, as it will, without the cere
mony ofbaptism. The "People" have
a party, and that party claims their
fealty, enlists their sympathies, and
calls forth their enthusiasm, and the
"People" want none other--the Dem
ocratic-Conservative Party.
Let every fannrmer read the ad
vertisement in this papersof "'Chn

half that is claimed for these crops
by the best authorities be true,
they are .indeed a godsend to the

Why the Radicals want the City
Government.
The facts connected with our City
Government imbroglio, and the per
sistant efforts of the Radical ring to
obtain the control of it, are begin
ning to be apparent to every one. It
is perfectly foolish to suppose that
the radicals want the offices of Mayor
and City Councilmen, for legitimate
purposes-that is not radical ambi
tion. Some object, some material
good to them, was in view from the
commencement of this fight to get
control of our city government.
There is one reason that many as
sign for their Radical efforts, and
that reason has been accepted by
both sides as tire gage of battle. In
elections, the power of the May;or,
swayed by a partizan, would plunge
this city into bloodshed in an instant.
Ileietofore the Conservative element
has had control, and even in 1874,
during the heat of that memorable
political canlpaign, the wise and pa
tr iotic action of the Democrats, alone
saved us from a bloody riot. To
many, as e have said, the political
control of the city seemed to be what
the radicals aimed at. A control in
this way; That they might fill our
streets with negro police officers, take
charge of the election boxes, and by
force and fraud foist upon our peo
ple such rulers as the ring might de
signate. But this is not the whole
cause for this fight, and we might say
it has but part to do with the main
issue. Tris reason can be held out as
a covering bulwark to what are their
true intents in the premises, and it
serves its purpose to that end.
The City holds Boullt, Blunt, and
others, as bondsmen for the default
ing Tax Collector, Redmond, and the
great object these people have, is to
put in power such a city government
as will not prosecute these claims, or
in the event of the case being deter
mined against them as it has been,
will settle as easy as possible. All
things tend to prove this to be a cor
rect solution of the efforts of our
radical enemies. The past acts ot
Boullt' go as strong evidoence in
support of this hypothesis. When
the parish obtained its judgment
against that delectable individual,
his Police Jury, at that tinme, made
just such a settlement as we now inti
mate. They over-rode the decision
of the Supreme Court, set its man.
dates, as well as those of the people,
at defiance, and relieved him totally
of the payment of the Judgment of
tire Court.
In this City defalcation judgment,
the end these fellows have in view, is
the same. The intent to swindle the
city is apparent, in more ways than
one-the character of thie bondsmen
a1s their rQd t fo'rt to. o4eoOeso a sew
city government, as well as certain
declamations that have leaked oaut,
prove this almost. Our citizens,
therefore, must guard against all
these things at once in this new Sim
mons radical government, and we feel
assured that they will do so with
proper calmness and determination,

Radical Reformers.
As our correspondent truly says, if
r there ever was a doubt, which we
- very much doubt, of reform from the
r Radicals of Natchitoches parish, the
action of their Convention upon Sat
t urday last, explodes it.
There is one trucism in politics
r that cannot be ganinsid, and that is,
º that the out-come is but the reflex of
the start. Grant, as President of the
I United States, is but the representa
s tive of Joyce, in the Missouri Peni
tentiary-- yers and Van Dusen,
Blunt and Raby, are but the ont-come
of such ignorance and venality, as
I assemble each year to manrk out po.
litical lines for this pari.h, and the
º pot boils up such scum as Kellogg,
Packard, and that host that are now
sitting upon the neck of Louisiana
like the old man of the mointain.
t We duo not claim an exemption from
this rule to either party, for it
works, like all good rules, both ways.
Tweed, in New York, is but the pro
totype of his plundering brothers in
º the South. It should serve as an ex
I ample-a fitting rebuke to those gen
t tlemen who relllse to take upon them
º selves the burdens necessary to a pa
r triotic citizen of a Republic and un
, less they wish to see a thousand
BR;nllt's, Myers', Blunt's, Tweed's and
Connely's, whlere there is bat one
now, let them continne to keep aloof
i from the primary organizations.
When such bad government as we
t have experielcced for the past ten
years, continues, it can be truth
r fully said, it was more their fault
t than otherwise.
But to recur to our subject: We
I cannot find language fitting, to de
nounce such hypocrisy as that acted
3 by the radicals here. There has been
) no complaint against their prolific
Spromnise,--in that, we have had more
r than a suffliciency. Year after year,
" we hive heard the now cant expres
sion, "we are pledged to reform."
I The tax-payers and good citizens,
. happily for themselves, want some
r thing more than simple paper declara
I tions, and they, coming from those
º radicals we have so long tried, pos
a sees but little virtue.
t Acts are now demanded, but when
such fellows as Blunt, Raby, Myers,
and Van l)usen, are held up to its
as the deciples of this new creed,
I it disgusts every one.
Happily we do not credit these peo.
ple longer, and intend to put these
reforms, not only upon paper, but in
f actual force with better material,
both in point of honesty, capability,
, and respectability, than Blunt, Raby,
º Van Dusen and Myers.
I At a meeting of tihe Denocratic-Con
serVattLVel Parish Clnlllral Commhniee,
I from the several Wards of the Par
Sish of Natchitoches, held ot the
S17th inst., in the city of Natchito
I ces, the following Resolutions were
adopted :
I Resolred, That the several Wards
Stlhr'otlighout tihe parish be requested to
elect delegates to a Conservative
Democriatic Convention, to assemble
in Natchitoches on Mondlay, May 8th,
1876, for the plurpose of perfecting
the org'aniz; tion of the people of rithe
parish of Natchitoches, and to take
Sinto consideration, such other mat
ters of political or public importance
as may be suggested. and to elect
r delegates to the State and District
Conventions.
Resoleed, That the basis of repre
sentation shall be one delegate for
every 50 votes east for Jno. C. Mon.
cure, in the general election of 1874,
and one delegate for every fraction of
50 votes east-provided, however,

Our neighbor of the lansfield
Reporter after quoting our article
in full on the Pacific Railway, says:
We gladly welcome this able
coadjutor and unselfish helper of
our railroad enterprise. While so
many are actuated by the selfish
designs of little cliques and fac
tions in the interest of smatll local
ities, it is truly refrleshing to mneet
such liberal and manly spirit as
the above. We hope the I)irectory
will run the road through Natchi
toches, and revivitfy and infuse
new life into that ancient City. It
is the only sure way to break
down that ring of political repro
bates who have so long preyed
upon the people of that section.
We hope that there will be a
full attendance at the meeting
called for Monday next, as it is
imperative that these organiza.
tions should be shaped by our best
citizens.

f The Republicans of Natchito
ches and Reform.
Editor Vinlicator :
IIad there been any hlope indulged
in by the good citizens, of the party
in power giving them a good honest
and intelligent government, that il
lusion was thoroughly dispelled by
f their so-called convention on Satur
3 day last.
For seven years marlked with fraud
and thievery, the radicals, who the:n
assenmbled, held high carnival amid
ruining Natchitoches. No peculation
was too base ; no robbery too hare
faced for thetm-they stand indicted
to-day either before the people or be
fore the courts as plunderers and
thieves. Ignorance, corruption and
venality, without one single instance
of virtue have mnarked their rule here.
º They tell us that they mean to reform
tfirom within. Blunt sounds tihe Gos
ipelt lorn, calls to his confessional the
fimithfuil they receive his blessing and
absolution and go forth to preach re
form and honesty.
Murderers, withl hands crimson
with the blood of their fellow beings
tell us they are the guardians and
teachers of "peace and good will."
Thieves clothed in the garments of a
I successful foray cry aloud from high
places that they are the expounders
f of honesty and honor. Bah ! it makes
us sick.
At the call of Bilnt and Lewis, two
as vile and bloodthilsty and coward
ly, withal, seoundrel.t as are out of
t the tate prison, the retforml clans as
senmble, and at the roll call these
worShies answer to their names:
Bonllt, D. H. (white) the Prince of
I thievec and planterers.
Myers, II. C. (white) the villainous
judge and sclool fund robber.
Van Dnsen, (white) the Spanish Lake
cow thief and arrester of white
citizens.
Y Breda, (white) the dirty Ptarishr Judge
peljurer and Cane river caval
ry raider.
And numerous senceless negroes
fill in the noble body.
These are the fellows who propose
to run Natchitoches parish--they are
It e'l men, delightfll, honest (?) men,
and are the champions of Republican
reform (t). The thieves organ cries,
':unload, honest men for office,' where.
upon this crowd steps smerkingly to
tihe front and answers, here!
Was there such brazen impudence
º ever before exhibited, and that too
right under the very noses of a peo
ple who know their character so well.
And then the delegates to the State
Convention. Behold the array and
then tremble ye opponents of the
Republican reform (I) party.
.BLUNT and RABY, the negro law
makerus by trace of U. S. troops for
- thie white tax payers of Natchlitehes,
the two leaders of the yelling faction
of demons who were want under the
3grinning fool Lewis to parade our
streets in military order, with pistol
and shot guns threatening death to
every white man that came in their
way. These two negroes, the aiders,
abettors and condoners of such plun
derers as Boullt and Myers, such
thieves as Van Dusen, such dirty
dogs as Breda, go to a State Conven
tion to elect delegates to another Con
vention that will name a fit man for
President of this Republic to govern
40 milltons of hon:est whites.
MYERS and VAN DUSEN are the
fit companions of these worthy (?)
negroes. They are notorious. Their
names can be found emblazoned on
the criminal docket of this parish.
Tley jledfrom justie fonr months since,
and Myers still remains away fearful
of arrest and trial, but his companion
Van Dusen comes back to be elected
with him a delegate to the State Con.
reltion of Radical reformers.
Such, Mr. Editor, is the start toward
good government thie Republicans of
Natchitoches parish make on their
march to reform in this our Centen
nial year, and that start satisfies every
honest man of the out come.
I would beg to ask the good eitiz
ens of Natchitoches if they intend to
submit to the rule of esuch men as
these thieves represent ? And I await
with painful anxiety their answer.
Yours,
COUNTRY.

things in their proper light when lie
settles down to his work, and is a
power of strength in the land, during
a "hot" camlpaign ; here is what he
says in reference to the election of
city officers, for Monroe:
An important State election is ap
proaching. Monroe, in North Lou
isiana, should not be behind Baton
Rougejn South Louisiana, in giving
tone and direction to tihe State cam
paign in behalf of determined oppo
sition to longer Republican rule. In
dividual preferences, ward lines and
nationalities are not matters worthy
to be regarded where victory and
self preservation are the issues. Let
every Democrat take for his watch
word, Monroe must redeem herself,
and let thie whole State have assu
rance that the people of Monroe claim
the front rank in time war upon Radi
caI el villanies and Negro supremacy.

TIl: NEXT I'I:EIEsi'.
The, f, iends of tihe variois candi
dates for the nomination at St. Louis
have been active, duillng the past
week, and it is almost impos.sible to
avoid discussion on the subject, when
ever opportunity for it occurs. Judge
Davis is very Ir.uch talked of, nbut it
is not evident that lie haus very great
strengtl - about as much pIerhaps,
a1s MI. TIhnrman. Gov. lendricks is
still the strongest among Western
menti. But. even amnong his most
earnest admirers, and no man hats
warmer friends, thlere are frequent
admnissioins thait it mnay be impossible
to elect a lestern uran. Whether
there be truth in this, or not, it is
very celtain that a tmanliity of the

wholI is cerlnLin to have the grealttest
strenglh In tihe last. T'rhe alibsolute
necessity of carrying New York and
New Jersey, as well as Connecticllt,
coupled with the evident attention of
the Ilephmlicans to make the
big fight in those States, i;has led to
the frequent mention of Iforalh) Sey
mnour, ais a man upon whom the party
could unite; and there was a strong
unndercurreint in his favor. But his
positive reflsal to be a c;nnlidate, and
the fact that he will (head the New
York delegation in favor of Sunnllll
J., Tilden, has had the effect of adl
dlingl very munlch to 'Tikeik's streligth.
'I'Tllei is certainly stlronger now than
at any time Ileretofore. I gather
these facts from Ilmen who are
opposed to Ti'l'ilen on some questions,

ney, and a lawyerof hIigh social and
professiotnal standing, with others,
formed a plan to send an innocent
manl, Columbus Alexander, to' State
prison, because he wais cuagid in
opposing the swinding operatiolns of
Boss Shepherd's Iting. To aceom
plish this, it was determninei by Bab
cock and Harrington to eniphy pro
fessional burglars to break open Ihe
safe of the District Attorney's office,
take out certain books and papers,
carry them to Alexander's house, and
deliver themn to him. At that mo
lietit, thIe Chief of Police, vwhio was to
be in waitillng was to have arrested
Alexninder. Tllell, ith brllrsiiitu. weu(r
to sweacr that Alexander eniplo-yed
them to cnmmit thie robbery. lar
riungton would have tried him inetolre
a packedl jury, anld lie would have
gone to State iirison. The schlenne
failed by a nlere accident. Thie bulrg
lars went to Columbus Alexnolder's
house at 1 A, M., instead of 10 P. x.,
as thiey were told to do, anti failed
to wake himn; and, on going aw.ay,
were themselves arrested by the Ipo
lice, who do not seem to Ihave been
fully informled as to thie details of tihe
plot. To catry out this plan, Bab
cock eillployed Co'. Whitley, who
hIas now turned States evidence
against his fellow conspirators. Af
terwards, whnen there was some pros
pect of bringing these villians.to jllst
ice, thIe then Attorney General, an in
famous scoundrel, know as Landanlet
Williams, gave an order to disconti
nue thie prosecutions. He did this in
collusion with General Babcock, and,
it is said, by order of Grant. Grant
is fully alive, now, to the danger lie
is in, himself ; and, as the tlegraliph
will hiave informed you, has demntand
edl to be heard before the Judiciary
Commnittee of thie House, in his own
vindication. His hour of action hias

T'lie Proposed Redlieuction of Sfalaries
has raised a howl..pf indignation
among government employees in
Waslinngton. Thie fact is tihat most
of the clerks hIave Ibecome accustom
ed to a style of living wholly out of
keepiing withi their ipositions. A $1,
600 or $1,800 clerk, for instance,
pays $900 or $1,000 per year for tihe
rent of a dwelling, when his salary
warrants him in paying not over $250
or $300, at most. He lives precisely
as persons of means live; has tihe
best thie market affords; buys the
most costly furniture; gives enter
tainments; and perhaps, keeps a
horse and carriage. It is easy to see
why a person who lives in sucel a
style complains of thie inadequacy of
his salary, and louIdly protest against
its reduction. If these persons could
once realize thie fact tlhat they are
poor men, lhey would find thleir pres
ent salaries quite sufficient for their
support. At any rate, should they
conclude to retire when their pres
ent connpensation is reduced, plenty
of substitutes, fully as well qualifietld,
will be foind ready to take their pilaces
in the Department. C. D.
We received throungh thie mnail this

our thanks.

Pinlchback's speech before the NYIL
ville Colored Convention and free
the editorial article thereon:
"lBut, friends, while slavery is d
beyond resurrection, our rights M
citizens are not secure, and our right
to vote even is not irrevocable. Th
organic law, the fifteenth amendmest
of the constitution of the Uuitel
States, simply declares that no St ts
shaill deprive any citizen of the ribt
to vote on account of race eolor or
previous condition. No State sh
deprive any citizen on account of c0l
or of this great prerogative; but they
can deprive you of this great prero
gative upon the ground of unfitoes
They can do that, and it is well they
can do it, I say I for unlkess w es@
cise thii& privilege in an intellhse

condition as citizens, the right ought
to be curtailed. [Applause.] YOl
had better clap louder on that. [LOd

not, it is a fact."
