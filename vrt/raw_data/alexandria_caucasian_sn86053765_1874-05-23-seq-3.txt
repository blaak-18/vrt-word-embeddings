The Negro—His Past ftod Future.
The want of space in our issno of
tho 2d inst., prevented us from fin
ishing what wjb had to say upon
this «ubject.
Some time ago when the commit
tee from South Carolina came to
present their grievances to the
President, the Washington * hron
icle, thought the Soutn ought.^to
congratulate itself on the rapid im
provement the negro 4iad' evinced
in his science of government. As
monopolies mark, 0 not only the
science, but the freedom of a gov
ernment, it may be well for us to
point out some of those to which we
alluded and which mark the fea
tures of his reigiign Louisiana. The
Slaughter housed'oinpany, the Su
gar Shed Company, the Lottery
Company, the Printing Company.
These are not all, but these ahme,
present an array iineqnaled in any
Kingdom or Empire in Europe and
yet. monopolies have over been ®re
garded as the most, oppressive and
most odious feat ures of a despotism.
Nor have these monopolies been
less disastrous to the prosperity
and freedom of Louisiana.than mo
nopolies have proved to prosperity
and freedom in Europe. Monopo
lies in despotisms have usually had
the excuse ol' being created for the
support of the government, but
each of those we have named, have
been purchased with bribes®and
created to pension the parasites ol
a depraved government. We ven
ture the assertion that no monopo
ly in any goverment in Europe, not
even excepting Turkey, can be
founed equal in its odious oppres
sion to either of those named
The Slaughter House Company is
granted the night of exacting a roy
alty from every inhabitant, of New
Orleans for the priviledge of killing
aud eating the animals he may
raise or purchase for his si pport, or
from the producer who may rais«
stock tor the New Orleans market
The only equivalent the Slaughter
House has given in retain is that
they bought this franchise of the
people from the negro Legislature.
The printing hill is equally cor
rupt. It is ji bill which virtually
prohibits the public 'pi lilting to be
done at less than 000. The
public printing which formerly was
<?oiie in duplicate; in French and
English; never cost over if*40 000.
Thus çt.iL'O 00(> is virtually a subsidy
distributed ainoug fifty or sixty
prating demagogues, who are in re
turn, to conceal by suppression mis
representation and falsehoods, the
shameful
of
for
shameful ignorance, thievery and
corruption ®>f the legislature and
Stute oUicials, and prate about lib
erty, •rebellion and equal rights to
all. s What but the ignorance, ven
ality and subserviency of the negro
would ever havf emboldened the
carpet-bagger and scalawag, to
have thus converted the printing
press, the bulwork of liberty, into
an instrument of falsehood and op
pression f f
The Lottery Company ! A fit se
quel to the dishonesty and villainy
of a government, whose sole pur
pose is public plunder, its moral
stench «remindsone of the (Jlne lae
tories of Loudon where all the vile
odors of decay seem to have taken
refuge. There ought, however, „0
be some thing to glean the fields of
moral corruption which had been
grown and reaped by the legisla
ture,,and we know of nothing so up
propria to as an incorporate den of
gamblers. 0 0
Tho Levee Company; that syP
oni mo of the wide waste of waters
which has left Louisiana in desola
tion and ruin. Lest the building
of the levees should attract enter
prise aud scientific engineers troni
abroad, it was converted into a
monopoly, which was expected to
build levies out of the public money
raised for that purpose; provided
any of it was left aft» r the company
had declared its vearlv dividends.
That #2 000 000; whose colfe-ction
was enforced anitafly under tlfe con
tinual threat of confiscation: would
not aflord a sufficient £0m to pay
the dividends ot the Cot@»any anil
build levees-was what none knew
better than tlio authors and sup
porters of the bill. Tint a State
engineer should have been appoint
ed to superintend the levees, if any
should be built, who knew 110 more
of engineering that the negro Lieu
tenant Governor knows of States
manship. or the Governor of truth
and good faith; aud that his only
qualification is his conversion from
a fire eating Rebel Gorilla to a Lou
isiana Republican is what every
body knows. That nothin
«km I
to keep up appearances and that I
Louisiana would be a waste of WU
ters whenever the Mississippi river !
[overflowed its banks, is what was
well known three years ago by
who think, as it is to day by
i ! ' 10se wll ° ,H,ver think. Ibis over
llowisa fair illustration of the ef
feet of negro statesmanship, not. on
I ly upon others but liimself. The
J portions of the State overflowed are
negro centers, and but for the char
ities of Congress aud others, one
third oî the negro population in
Louisiana would perish with want.
While his govern ment has boon
calamitous to all, it greatest calam
ities lia^e falle:; upon Iiis own race.
In the midst of insecurity-which it,
has created, he is the most insecure.
J11 the inidst, of poverty he is the
poorest. Without a single public
improvement under his-rule of eight
years, the .State debt has increased
$20 000 000, and that ill the face of
a taxation twenty times as great as
in the days Of her prosperity. The
Turks have made file worst govern
ment in Europe, but we doubt if
the Turks would, in eight years,
have made so complete a desolation
of so fair «1 country. The negro
rule in South Carolina is even
worse. It is no better in Arkansas
and Mississippi and was fast reach
ing the same conditions in Jcunos
see, Texas and Virginia. All this
bad government, although the re
sult of negro majorities, is not the
work of negro thought. His crea
tive genius cannot even claim that
infamous honor. In government he
has only exhibited the same traits
which have marked his character
for three thousand years. He has
been the mere instrument in the
hands of others; in the legislature
he has been as open to the bribery
of thieves and robbers as his ances
tors were to those of the Slaver. As
eady to sell the liberties of the
State for greenbacks, as his ances
tors were to sell their neighbors, or
even their own children tor a lew
brass trinkets, or yards of curtain
calico!« As ready to obey the car
pet-bagger and' Scalawag at the
ballot, box, as the overseer on the
plantation, as ready to believe that
it was right to steal and aid the
carpet-bagger to steal tlftf*jniblic
money, as he was ready to believe
it, was right to steal his master's
hogs. Thus in whatever situation
he has been placed; whether oni the
coast of Africa, aiding the Slaver in
kidnapping his own race, or at l lo
ba I lot box, or in the halls of legis
lation, or on the plantations ol the
South, he has ever been the same
passive instrument, without a plan
of the own, and ready and eager to
obey the will of another. Iii the
hands of tho wicked he has *10011 an
instrument of evil and only evil,
and there havo been few greater
Benedict Arnolds, traitors to liber
ty ami honor, than the Scalawags
and Carpet bagger of the South. A"
we have .said the negro in slavery
is a cm*e full of curses, to the
South, and we fear will prove an
equal curse to our republic in his
bccdom. It sounds like irony when
the Chronicle cites his political ea
rner as evidence of the rapid pro
gross which the negro has made in
civilization since Ills emancipation.
V\ o are willing to do h m more jus
tice, than to judge his tutjjre fro$i
such a standpoint; the standpoint
l ' oui which '«e makes his worst ap
pearance. But our space forbids a
further discussion of his claims at
present.

Tho lictoift of the snfrnp at Wash

country dtldlike tigers are Iicking.their
hps '-villi the taste of the forthcoming
blood. They are mustering their
cIiiub and with worthy prudence will
forward them well instructed in wliat
is required of them. Tho people do
not seem alive to (he momentous im
portance of this Gnjnt Parish qnes
lion. It is bat the entering of a
wedge which when driven to the
lieud will leave 11s * buttered and
ruined, l not Jhe lifeless victims of
an (lnpiiralleled persecution. What
will property, family or life be
worth when, rising victorious from
the arena in which onr very blood
is to be spilt, the satellites of the
tyrant wdl rotijrn to over awe us at
our own firesides, and tear from our
very hearts the last drops of exist
ence? What avails law or evidence ?
The hist trial gives us tho extent to
which justice will bo meted to 11s.
Do tho pe: plo of these parishes
fully realize that eight of their fellow
citizens are now on trial for their
Lives, for defending what nature it
self has guaranteed to all created
hemes the right to defend family
and life 1 Do they not know thai
the next step will bo to place every
one in The same position in which
the prisoners stood at tho time of
the conflict?
What will prevent tho blacks from'had
rearming and when the cry of alarn'
will be raised, what will be our
remedy ? .The exact counterpart of
the Colfax trouble. We will have to
nrni otirselvesto defend our very ex
istence and the government will
force on uh tho very same result
The same penalties will be exacted
from the unfortunate participators
and the yiarcb of reconstruction
will be on oilr prostrate bodies and
dilapidated homes. For a population
to stnnd mnte and paralyzed while
the very handcuffs of slavery are
being riveted to their wrists is almost
unparalleled in the annals of civilized
nation p . What mat ters government ?
What matters risks? \\ hat matters
life? When all wo have, when all
hold dear is at stake. Forbearance
has ceased to be a virtne and the
shadow of what is forthcoming bodes
• inly disaster and relentless perse
cution. It is on an occasion like
this, that a people rising above all
con ideration of self, will assort
their natural rights at all hazards.
Look at Ireland I Persecuted,
mangled, bleeding, she stands yet,
to-day, a living icting monument of
resistance to oppression and tyranny
Look at Poland 1 undaunted, facing
the united strength of three powfyr
fnll nations, her sons perfered exile
to submission. And look at our own
country? When proud Britain, se
cure in its treasures and power, un
dertook to make tho young colonies
fell the grasp of its strength ; the
people, stiong in. their rights, hurXl
i»ick their defiance and with Btrro
blows as can only bo dealt, by
those who must conquer or ifie # soon
»aught their oppressors that tlig fate
of but le does not belong " to the
strong alone." We are not defend
ing to -day, as we did before, the in
stitution of ulaverv, nor are we pre
tending to cluim any right under the
Constitution ; wo are defending to
day our right to live, our right,
which was given to us by God to
protect all that belong to us.
Let us then form ourselves for our
defence and submit to nothing, yes
lefend our rights as men to all ex
tremity. We have ta ked enough, it
is our time to act. They want onr
blood, let our oppressors pay for it
the 01 ly price which freemen can re

Oh the evening of laut Wednes
day we repaired to the fine Hall of
the Exchange Hotel, to witness the
performance of the Charade* and
Tableaux, gotten up by and for the
benefit of nie young ladies of Mrs.
Cnnlichl's School, aud found a large
aud most respectable audience al
ready assembled. As wo entered,
the band of that accomplished mu
sician Professor L. Chantz, was
discoursing sweet music to appre
ciative listeners. Then we were
treated to a series, of Tableax, em
bracing: The Gypsey's Warning,
The Wreath of Rosebuds, Rebecca
und Rowena, Snow White and Rose
Red, Tho Wreat h of Roses and Ti
tania and her Court. These'were
all well rendered—noticeable among
tiiein for perfection, being that of
Rebecca and Rowena, in which the
beautiful daughter of our friend
Jjilius Levin, Miss Julia was Re
becca with her dark hair and eyas,
and Miss Emma Whittington, with
her fair hair aud blue eyes was
iv?»\vena.
Then we had "Changeable" a
Charade, in which Miss Julia Leviu
had tho principal character, ably
assisted by Miss Bianca Weil iu
the other feminine role , who render
ed her part in a most excellent and
satisfactory maimer. The mule
characters ol® the peice were well
performed by Mr. Win. Leckie as
Don Carlos Sinythe, the young
geiitlemah whoso foreign travel
from'had changed his primitive ideas
I about sweethearts, home made Ci
der, &c., &., and—shall we say it f
by our head devil, Mr. Eddie Bud
dciibrock, whose ®services as the
worthy and steady Abel Smith had
been specially engaged for the oc
casion. With all the printers ink
washed oft'his face and- hands, his
caudle appendage rolled up and
safely bid @ in his pockety and his
club loot stowed away in a huge
pair of red top Jack boots, we
hardly knew him ; and when bis
steadiness and devotion were re
warded with tho hand and fortune
of the heroine, and he stepped up
to take her hand, .wo felt like wri
ting up a first class marriage no
tice or obituary, we did'nt know
which.
Next in order came more tab
leaux, being: Tho Crowning of the
May Queen, the Statue Bride, the
Pyramid of Flowers, Faith, Hope
and Charity, the Bridal, the Paint
ers Last Touch and the Execution
of Beatrice Cenci. These were fol
lowed by another Charade, The
Politician, with the following cast
of characters
Polly, Mrs. A. Canfield ; Bertha»
Miss. Bianca Weil f Maid, Miss Ce
cilia Weil ; Mr. Evergreen, Mr.
J. W. Rielly; Harry, Mr. Murray
Hetherwick ; Mr. Morris, Mr. J P.
