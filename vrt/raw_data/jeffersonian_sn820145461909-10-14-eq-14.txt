GET THE YOUNG FOLKS INTER
ESTED.
Get the young folks interested in
poultry. It will be an inspiration to
them and especially the girls on the
farm. It pays to develop ideals ear
ly in life and to make them practi
cal. Making a success with ten or
twenty hens will tell powerfully on
the future business career of any
young man. This small business in
volves all the essential features of
the largest business in after-life.
It demands study and care in plan
ning and management. Industry in
executing details is necessary. Sys
tem and order are developed. The
importance of meeting conditions
successfully is brought out in feed
ing, housing, caring for their health,
and maturing the fowls. Practical
contact with humanity in selling and
buying is learned. Economy in cost
of production and saving for further
investment will help on to thrift and
business success. This is practical
education of the highest order. —In-

PTOMAINE POISONING.
The frequency in recent years of
ptomaine poisoning has made that a
thing to be dreaded by humans, and
especially in families. Ptomaines
develop in decaying flesh, and no
meats should be eaten that are not
positively known to be free from
even the slightest beginning of de
cay. Oysters and fish are perhaps
the most dangerous, as they decay so
readily, and are so often treated in

such away as to hide the ordinarily
understood evidences of decay.
Os course, decaying vegetables, as
well as decaying meats, should not be
used as foods; but ptomaines do not
develop in decaying vegetables. Bac
teria develop in decaying vegetables,
but bacilli in decaying meats. To ar
rest the development of these mi
crobes harmful chemicals are fre
quently used, both as meat and veg
etable preservatives, to prevent which
is the object of the pure-food laws;
but the safest rule is to use none but
fresh foods. In this farmers have an
advantage over all other classes.
Most of their food comes directly
from their gardens and fields, and
from the home-cured meat in their
smokehouses, or from the chicken
yard. We hail farmers as the hap
piest of the world’s workers. They
lack only the development of the
marketing of their stuff to make
them the most independent, if not
the most wealthy.—Up-to-Date Farm

THE VALUE OF SOME CROPS
WHEN FED TO HOGS.
The Louisiana Experiment Station
found that sweet potatoes yielding ap
proximately 300 bushels per acre
produced $73.50 worth of pork. The
hogs had access to a bermuda pasture
and the gain was valued at 6 cents
per pound.
Stock beets when fed in combina
tion with cornmeal proved to be
worth about S6O per acre.
The Arkansas Station obtained a
Blje
gain of 313 pounds of pork from one
fourth acre of peanuts. At this rate
one acre would produce $75 worth of
gain, if six cents per pound were re
ceived. The profit from an acre of
corn fed to hogs, in comparison with
the peanuts, was $26. At the Ala
bama Station, peanuts proved to be a
more profitable hog pasture than
corn, peas, sweet potatoes or sor
ghum.— Southern Agriculturist.
PUT MORE BAGGING ON YOUR
COTTON.
Again we would urge our cotton
growers to put on bagging and ties
to the full 6 per cent, limit this sea
son. If you put on less than 6 per
cent. —that is to say, 30 pounds on a
500-pound bale, 26 on a 450-pound
bale, etc., —it is simply a matter of
giving the cotton buyer good cotton
worth 12 1-2 cents a pound when he
is paying you only for bagging and
ties averaging about 3 1-2 cents a
pound. This is a matter our farm
ers have been entirely too slow to
understand.
The gist of the whole matter is
simply this: The price of cotton is
fixed by manufacturers who buy on
a basis of 6 per cent, deduction for
bagging and ties. That is to say,
they figure on 30 pounds tare for
each 500-pound bale; and on each
500-pound bale, therefore, they al
low a price for the gross bale suffi
cient to pay for only 470 pounds net
of lint cotton. In other words, the
price paid per pound for the whole
500 pounds is lowered so as to al
low for 30 pounds tare.
Now, the average farmer, instead
of putting 470 pounds of lint cotton
and 30 pounds of bagging into a
500-pound bale, puts in 478 pounds
of cotton and 22 pounds of bagging
—thereby putting in 8 extra pounds
of 12 1-2 cent cotton worth sl, in
stead of 8 pounds of bagging and
ties worth 28 cents. —Progressive
Farmer.
GOOD FARMING.
The St. Paul Farmer, answering
its own question, tells what good
farming is under three heads —a ro
tation of crops that will keep the
land clean and balance up the crops
in proportion to the condition of the
soil; a rotation that includes a pe
riod of grass, preferably clover or al
falfa, a period of cultivation, and a
period of grain production. Next is
what is called factory farming—
treating the products as raw mate
rial and live stock as machines to
convert the material into milk, beef,
pork, mutton or wool. The third
step in good farming is to take care
of the manure so that the fertility in
it be not lost but restored to the soil
whence it came.
THE POLITICAL RECORD OF
’SQUIRE JOINES.
(From “Yellow Creek Humor’’, by
William J. Burtscher.)
The first political convention in
the campaign of 1908 was that of
the Populists, in which Tom Watson
of Georgia was nominated for Presi
dent of the United States.
’Squire Joines read about it, at
once sold a pig and subscribed for
Watson’s papers, then sold another
pig and bought some of Watson’s
books. He went up and down Yel
low Creek for a month talking for
Watson.
“I tell you,” said he, “Watson’s
the man for me. Watson’s a fine
historian, a fine editor, and he’ll
make a fine president. I say, Hur
rah for Watson,”
The second convention was held
by the Socialists. Eugene V. Debs
was the choice of that convention.
’Squire Joines sold a few dozen
eggs at the One-Hoss Store and sub
scribed for the Appeal to Reason,
and then sold some more eggs and
bought books on Socialism.
His neighbors were surprised
when they learned of the ’Squire’s
conversion.
“Yes,” he declared, “since I have
been reading the Appeal I see where
all of us poor fellers ought to vot*
for Debs. The Socialist party is the
poor man’s party, and I hope every
last one of you down here on Yel
low Creek will join in with me and
help the poor man. Watson’s all
right, but Debs is better. Hurrah
for Debs—he’s the man for Joines.” |
Now it also happened that the Re
publicans had a convention in 1908, J
in which William Howard Taft was
nominated.
’Squire Joines heard about it, and
decided, after reading the platform,
that Republicanism suited him about
right. So he sold a calf and sub
scribed for a Republican paper.
So the Yellow Creekers were sur
prised once more. Who ever saw
such a versatile man as the ’Squire’ 1
“The fact is,” explained th*
’Squire, “the Republicans have ri 1
the Government so long that the.,
just naturally know how —and for a
big man I guess Taft’s it. So I’s 1
going to vote for Taft if I lose eveA
friend I’ve got.”
The Democrats, too, had a conven
tion that year. William
Bryan was the man.
’Squire Joines heard about tha 1
He read the platform. Sold a co «
and subscribed for Bryan’s Co
moner, and sent the remainder
the money to the Democratic cam
paign fund.
“Poor Bryan,” he said, “has bes' ‘
running now the third time, an’ \ I
just ought to have it. My fathKl
was a Democrat, and so was r J
grandfather. I say, down with t I
plutocrat and up with the |
Hurrah for Bryan! Guess I’ll v? -V
for him.”
Still another convention follows
—that of the Prohibitionists. ’Squire
Joines read about that, sold a horse,
subscribed for the Patriot Phalanx,
and began to talk Prohibition, of
fering no apology for his change, ex
cept that it would be time enough to
elect Taft or Bryan after we get rid
of the saloon.
However, after the conventions
were over, ’Squire Joines cooled off
somewhat and gave his neighbors a
rest. But the strangest thing about
it all was that when election day
finally came ’Squire Joines did not
vote at all.
