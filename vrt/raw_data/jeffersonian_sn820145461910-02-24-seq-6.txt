LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
DECAY OF OUR REPUBLIC.
Dear Sir: —Will you please give
me a few points through your next
issue -of The Jeffersonian on the af
firmative side of this question:
“Resolved, That the United States
will decay as well as nations of an
tiquity.”
Thanking you in advance, I am
Yours truly,
LAWTON BLANTON.

Answer.
If you will get Mommsen’s “His
tory of Rome” and read his descrip
tion of conditions existing immedi
ately prior to the downfall of the
Roman Empire, you will find a start
ling similarity between said condi
tions and those in which we now find
ourselves. Under class legislation,
the wealth had been concentrated
into the hands of a few: power had
also become consolidated: crimes
went unchecked and unpunished:
immorality was rampant: the rich
revelled in dissipation: the poor
looked to the public granaries for
their food. Men became effeminate,
and women appeared to want to
change places with the men: the
State was corrupt, society was cor
rupt: the electorate was bought and
sold. The empire had stretched its
boundaries until the heart was
weakening in the effort to send blood
to the extremities. The old stand
ards which made people respect in
dustry, honesty, virtue, sobriety, pa
triotism, had passed away, and had
been superceded by servility to
wealth and power. While a few of
the great Roman families became
richer and richer, the millions of
the Roman people became more de
praved and desperate. Immigration
from all parts of the known world
followed into Rome; the old Latin
stock was lost in miscellaneous mon
grelism. As this process of race mix
ture went on, the Roman became
less and less of a man. He could no
longer bear the weight of the armor
that his forefathers had carried with
ease. He wanted amusement in the
arena, where wild animals fought
with each other, or with gladiators;
or where gladiators fought and slew
each other. From this public thea
tre, he wanted to go to a debauch;
and then, after recovering from the
debauch, he would go to the theatre
again. Life to him meant pleasure;
duty no longer called to him, hon
orable ambition no longer inspired
him. If he could have a good time,
he was happy: the future could take
care of itself. Consequently, the
heart of this great people gradually
rotted out; and the sceptre fell away
from hands that had become too en
feebled to hold it.
You can look around you and see
to what extent our public affairs re
semble those which I have briefly
referred to as being characteristic
of declining Rome.
(Note. — Any book-seller will tell
you prices of books mentioned in
The Jeffs. It is most troublesome
for me to answer questions of that
kind, one reason being that there are
so many different editions and dif
ferent dealers with varying prices.)

THINKS HE WILL LIKE THE
JEFFS.
Dear Sir:—l have just commenced
to read your paper, and think I will
like it as it seems to call things by
their right names. Will you please
send me two copies of December
23d? I will send them to some of
my Chicago friends, and may get
some subscribers for you.
Will you inform me where I can
get book by Michael J. F. McCarthy,
“Priests and People in Ireland”?
Your article on Mr. Outler’s open
letter is all true. I am a Scotch
man and know a good deal of the
history of the times you write. Am
seventy-foui’ years old, came to this
country in 1863. I will enclose some
stamps, and if you will kindly do
me this favor, I will be very thank
ful. Yours very truly,
SAMUEL FORREST, SR.
Rt. 3, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.
Answer.
The book was published in Great
Britain. Order from Union Library
Association, New York City.

ANOTHER MAN WHOM THE SO
CIALISTS HAVE DECEIVED.
Dear Sir:—l was once one of your
most ardent admirers. There was a
time when I would have walked
twenty-five miles to vote for you for
the Presidency. But, “alas, my
brother!” The giddy heights to
which your country men have ele
vated you has turned your head; and
in all probability affected your heart.
Is it possible that the Scriptural
statement that “a gift destroyeth the
heart” has been demonstrated
through you?
You may ask why my opinion of
you has undergone so great a change.
I will tell you why. It is bepause
you are wilfully and knowingly de
ceiving your readers; some of them,
at least. Your recent tirades against
Socialism are put in evidence.
Could there be anything more un
just, more unfair, more ungentle
manly? Can you afford to oppose a
thing that can not be suppressed ex
cept by “false accusation?” In all
arraignments and denunciations of
Socialism, did you refer a single
time to the National Platform of the
Socialist party? If you did it es
caped my notice.
If Mr. Ellis, whom the friends of
Foreign Missions wished to pit
against you, was unworthy of your
steel, how could you condescend to
enter the arena with Herr Bebel, an
obscure German, whose writings
must be translated into English, and
who is a rank stranger to ninety per
cent, of your readers?
Your methods against Socialism
seem to me to be beneath the dig
nity of a gentleman and a scholar. I
may be mistaken, and hope I am, but
I have about concluded that you are
writing for buncombe; to please the
rabble, and not as a statesman and
logician.
Alas, my brother! I am sorely
disappointed in you. But I still hold
you in high esteem, because you af
ford a fine exhibition of intellectual
attainment, and in that respect you
are a giant among us.
Very truly yours,
L. W. BEARD.
Ruston, La.
Answer.
Dear Mr. Beard:—Ordinarily, a
letter like yours would be laid aside
without further notice, for it proves
how very little you know about the
subject concerning which you cen
sure me. Your reference to the fact
that you were once a Populist, and
a supporter of mine, proves that you
were once in the right position; and
that being so, there is some slight
hope that you might be recalled from
3effersoalan
the error of your way, and made to
repent your departure from the do
mains of reason and common sense.
You say that Herr Bebel is “an ob
scure German.” Now, my dear sir,
that shows how utterly lacking you
are in information on the subject of
Socialism. For mere than twenty
years, Herr Bebel has been' the offi
cial National leader of the German
Socialists. He is as well recognized
hs their party leader in the German
Parliament "aS Mr. Gladstone was
ever recognized as the leader of the
Liberals in the English Parliament:
he is now, and has been for a gen
eration, just as obediently followed,
and as admiringly acknowledged, as
the German leader, as Aldrich and
Cannon were recognized in the last
Congress as the acknowledged bosses
of the Republican party. At every
European Congress of Socialism,
Herr Bebel is held as their official
chief: his word goes: his commands
are obeyed; the plans that he maps
out are followed. His book, “Wo
man Under Socialism,” has run
through nearly forty editions, and
has been accepted in Europe and
America as the official word of So
cialism on the subject of Women,
Marriage and Private Property.
The International Socialist Re
view, of Chicago, is committed to
the same doctrine as that laid down
in Bebel’s book. The city dailies
and weeklies published in New York
and Chicago by the Socialists harp
on the same string continually.
You have simply allowed yourself
to be hoodwinked and deluded by
such publications as the Rip Saw and
the Appeal to Reason which, baiting
their traps to catch ignorant coun
try people and dissatisfied members
of existing parties, have pretended
to preach what are recognized as
Populist principles. There isn’t a
man who knows a thing about So
cialism who doesn’t concede that the
private ownership of a single acre
of land is utterly at war with the So
cialist creed, and utterly incompati
ble with the new social order which
they advocate. There isn’t any well
posted reader after those who are
representative Socialists of the big
cities, and of Europe, who do not
realize that they make bitter war up
on our marriage system, and upon
our religious establishment.
You have simply gone astray, fol
lowing these European fanatics, and
devouring those lies that the Appeal
to Reason has been publishing from
week to week in the effort to show
that Socialism really is about what
Populism used to be —and is now, as
far as that is concerned.

I wonder how you think I could
afford to publish things of that kind
if I could not prove them. I have
bought their books; I have examin
ed carefully to see what they mean.
If you would read the series of ar
ticles which have been appearing in
my Magazine, you would recognize
the conscietious fidelity wi£h which
I have sought for the true meaning
of those who are advocating this re
volting creed, which is meant to ut
terly destroy existing institutions,
confiscate all private property, and
bring upon mankind the curse of ra
cial equality and sexual promis
cuity.
You speak to me about not refer
ring to the national platform of the
Socialist party. Why should I do
that? That platform was made to
catch votes, just as the Republican
platform is shaped for that purpose,
and just as the Democratic platform
is framed for that purpose. Could I
prove from the national platform of
the Democrats and the Republicans
that they are both the pliant tools of
