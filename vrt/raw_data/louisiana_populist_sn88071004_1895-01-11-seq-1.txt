TO THE PRESS.
State Bureau of Agriculture,
Baton Rouge, La-, Dec. 7, '94.
We desire to call your attention
to the ninth annual meeting of the
Louisiana State agricultural Society
which will take place at Natchito
ches on January 23, 24 and 23,
1895.
A large and representative body
of planters and farmers of this
State is desired at this meeting.
To accomplish this every agricul
tural organization, including plan
ters' associations, farmers' clubs,
granges and unions are earnestly
requested to send delegates.
The committee on programme
has appealed to the police juries of
the various parishes to send two
or more planters or farmers as del
egates from each parish. Favor
able action of each police jury is
not only most earnestly desired,
but will meet with the honest ap
proval of every friend of agricul
tuare.
The present financial condition
of our agriculturists calls for seri
ous thought and deliberation.
Low prices of our staple products,
unreliable labor, soil depletion and
high money rates have deprived
our profession of much of its prof
to and all of its pleasures. Chan
ges in our methods and perhaps
in our crops are imperative, and
what these shall be can be best
determined by the combined wis
dom of assembled conventions of
our leading men. It is therefore
earnestly desired that farmers and
planter from all parts of the State
be present at this meeting and
participate in its deliberations.
The old city of Natchitoches will
extend its usual hospitality, and
the farmers of Cane river will wel
come their brothers from other por
tions of the State.
Respectfully,
A. V. CABTEB,
Commissioner of Agriculture.
Tenure For Life.
It is questionable if the principle
of life tenure for the federal judges
is a wiseone. Itwas so regarded
when our forefathers engrafted it
in the constitution, and for many
years after. The provision was
borrowed from the English system.
There it had been recognized that
the appointment of judges "for
lifeor during good qlhavior" was
essential to an independent judicia
ry. The judge must be removed
from all fear of removal or duress,
and must not be subjected to the
necessity of electioneering, or the
people eould not be sure of an im
partial and fearless judiciary. The
principle seems to have worked
well in England as a general thing
though her history is not without
examples of corrupt, cruel and
wholly unfit judges.
In our own country, up to a
camparitiyely recent period, the
rnggestion to cbamge from am ap
pointive to an eltive e.dral ju
diiary would h ve beem eceived
wiSh Impatines,t if not positive
diaver. This, too, is the more
irerns beesmi the judiciary in all
IheU seinsIicCW So a terh of
yed baite by pephr vas or
the legila:tuire. If the life tenure
principle w«as so indispensal)e how
does it happen that it was not ap
plied to the state judges ? It would
seem to he as necessary in the one
case as the other, a:ind even mllore
so, as the state judiciary far out
numbers the federal, and deals
with a much wider range of causes
x,oth civil and criminal. Latterly,
though, a suspicion seenm to have
entered the popular mind that after
all the life tenure idea may not he
so sacred a safeguard as had been
supposed. For 01o0 years after the
inauguration of the government
the Ieople regarded the United
States supreme court with ahnlmost
superstitious reverence. Their de
cisions were received as the decrees
of an infallible tribunal, their per
sonality was endowed with an awe
inspiring sancity, and even their
individual or "ohiter dictum" out
givings were received with the res
pect formerly bestowed upon the
prophecies of the I)elphic oracle.
The first rude shock that broke
this delusion was the action of the
electoral commission in ',7;. The
people then saw the grave and im
maculate judges, in the decicion of
questions purely legal, dividing
strictly on party lines with as
much facility and promptness as
ordinary heelers obeying a caucus
decree. It was found that even
judges for life were still men and
nothing loth to "give up to party
what was meant for mankind."
Other events that have transpired
since then have still farther streng
thened the opmion that something
more than a salary for life without
fear of removal is neccessary to
prevent judges from becoming, or
rather remaining, both partisans
and pettifoggers. We realize
now that we have no effectual
check and practically no control
over the men who are clothed with
such tremendous power and influ
ence. It is true that a remedy by
impeachment is provided by the
constitution but for all practical
purposes it might as well have been
omitted. In all ,our history only
one judge has been impeached and
he was acquitted though clearly
proven guilty, The proceeding is
imposing and ponderous but utter
ly worthless as a method of remov
al. The impeachment cannot be
obtained except from a house full
of partisans, nor tried except by a
senate conmposed of other parti
sans. If of the same political faith
as the accused judge, no impeach
ment can be obtained. If of o
posite belief their action will be
discredited in advanee by suspic
ion of badness of motive. So by
general consent impeachment has
long since been abandoned and no
judge is in danger of being called
before the senate for a less crime
than murder or highway robbery.
The only remedy therefore is to
change the constitution and elect
the federal judges by popular vote.
Whatever may be the evils, real or
supposed, connected with an elec
tive judiciary it is plain that they
are to be preferred to those which
exist in spite of the prevalence of
the opposite system. The unjust
judge, admittedly the greatest of
all public evils, can at least be
reached m time by the elective
process, while the appointive ju
diciary, as we have shown, is upon
us indefinitely during both good
and bad behavior. The people
made a great mistake in surren
dering all their power over them
and it should be recalled if possi
ble. There is a day of accounting
for all other oicials and there is
no reason why the federal judges
also should not occasionally be
called to book. The people gen
rally, and organied labor espec
ially, are vitally interested in this
qutiom. Init is involved a sedl
ous menace to lxppular lilberty anti
a deadly danger to the integrity of
our institutions.
The new llicksian code is not
well received, nor is Jenkins' ready
relief for rec,.ivers accepted as it
palatable judicial pill, Even the
sacred gospel of '"contempt of
court," enunciated by the gowned
evangels of capitalism. is not re
garded as as:afe fouldatiou for the
temple of liberty. 'I'h judiciary
at best'needs watching. Many of
our ablest statesman have regard
ed it as the weak spot in our polit
ical system and warned the people
against-its encroachments. Jeffer
son, noted for his prescience as
well as his patriotism, explressed
fears lest the lifetime judges might
grow too large for their harness.
Marshall, himself a judge, and the
ablest of our chief just ices, gave
utterlnce to this pregnant warn
ing: "A corrupt judiciary is the
worst curse that can be sent by a
vengeful deity upon a sinful peo
ple." As far back as 1829, John
Randolph, the most far-seeing of
our earlier statesmen, said on the
floor of the Virginia convention:
"Mr. President, I firmly believe
that if the liberties of this country
are ever destroyed, if the pillars of
the temple are pulled down over
our heads, it will be by the Sam
sons of the judiciary." These
noteworthy warnings seem in pro
cess of fulfillment. At least it is
well to keel) on guard, remember
ing that "eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty." There is still
another and even a more remarka
ble admonition on this subject than
any recorded above. In that vol
ume which Christians accept as the
embodiment of all truth and wis
dom, the Book of Kings succeeds
the Book of Judges.-Nonconfor

Southern Ballot Rights
Convention.
Hon. J. C. Manning, the Populite
Leader of Alabama,
Who Called the Meeting in New
Orleans 'This Month,
Arrives in the City to Make Pre
liminary Arrangements.
Some Details of the Proposed
Gathering and the Results
Expected to Follow.
N. O. Picaynae.
Hon. J. C. Manning, the populite
leader of Alabama, arrived in the
city yesterday and stopped at the
Grunewald.
Mr. Manning came here to make
arrangements for the ballot reform
convention, to be held in this city
on the 18th inst. The convention
will be held probably in the Wash
ington Artillery Hall and will be
attended by representatives of all
political parties in all the southern
states.
Mr. Manning talked to a Picay
une reporter on the movement,
which he said was gaining in all
the southern states.
Every one is becoming interest
ed in ballot reform, and he hopes
to see the movement terminate in
the destruction of the professional
ballot-box stauffer.
Mr. Manning is a young man 25
years of age, but is a good speak
er, and as a political evangelist
there is not a man in Alabama who
courts a contest on the stump with
him. He is full of resonrces, and
seems so thoroughly imbned with
his mission that he concentrates
every energy in promulgating bal
lot reform doctrines. He is the
best friend of Reuben F. Kolb, and
it is said was largely at the bottom
of the attempt of Kolb to take his
seat as governor. He is a member
of the national committee of his
party; and was vice president of
the last convention that nomina
ted Weaver for president, he mak
ing the nominating speesh. He
has preached his doctrines all over
the South, but said yesterday that
he was not working up ballot re
form for political purposes, as all
men of all political faiths are in
vited to take part in the conven
tion. He wants to see the day, he
says. when it will be a disgrace and
a crime against the law for a man
to stuff a ballot-box. lie desires
to see an organization made so
complete that investigations will
be conducted and men prosecuted
who carry on fraudulent elections.
The populite orator and organi
zer lives in Montgomery, Ala. He
is highly esteemed there by all par
ties for his work in the interest-of
honest elections.
The convention which is to be
held here will last two days. Gov
enor Foster is to be invited to
speak, and other prominent men
will be present to take part in the
proceedings.
Speaking to a reporter on the
subject Mr. Manning said :
"I expect to see between 400 and
500 persons at the convention; Ala
bama alone will send 100, and the
whole affair will be a big success.
I am confident that to the southern
man an honest election is of para
mount importance. If you go
North to try and induce emigration
or in some cases to induce eve.
transient visits just to show our
northern friends what a glorious
country we have, you are met with
the answer 'that they don't feel
like coming here ouraccount of the
political intolerance that prevails.'
This is true, and any honest man,
if he wants to, will admit it. This
intolerance extends to the annull
ing of the votes of some of the men
that have fought and bled for t
south, and the vote of the old "vet"
is freqnently substituted by the
ballot of some nigger or other per
son who has no electoral rig ha
This sort of thing tends to perpe
trate an oligarchy in power. To
the end that I might :become post
ed on the subject of ballot reform I
have given the subject the closest
attention, and within the last five
months I have interviewed some of
the leading Democrats, Republi
cans and Populists in the South.
They all think that the time has
come for solving of the vexed
question of ballot reform. They
think that this is due to the peo
pie, and so it has been arranged
that there shall be a general con
ference. There will be delegates
from Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Tennes
see, Alabama, Arkansas, Missis
sippi and Louisiana. Among the
speakers that will address the con
ference will be Marion Butler,
General: Fields and Mr. Settle.
Governor Henry Clay Evans of
Tennessee; A. S. Collier, Frank
Burkett and many other promi
nont men will be on hand at the
time the convention comes round,
forall these men are in favor of
our movement. 'Governor' Kolb
will attend the meeting. as well as
Mayor Van Hoose. of Birmingham,
and W. 8. Beese, whom we claim
was rightfully elected United
States Senator, will be there too.
We shall elect an executive com
mittee, which will organize and
declare the purpose of the league.
Ex-Governor Smith, of Alabama,
will come to the meeting, I am
sure if his time wiil permnit. There
will be both day and evening ses
sions held of the convention, and
we expect to get through a great
deal of work.
"Ifthe leagne is organized on
the lines that 1 think it will be,
the work that it will perform will
be much of an edu cational charac
ter. We will issu'a literature and
publish statistical matter, and it
will not be sectional or political in
tits functions. Democrats, Repub
licans and Populists alike will we
expect toeomnbine on the common
gound, tospeure a fair and honest
conht uit th polling booth. W\V
will help in the collection of evi
deuce for members who will satis
fy the league that they are being
lefrauded out of their legislative
rights, and in a number of other
ways we will assist at the exposing
of the wrongs that are so openly
perpetrated at every election.
The headquarters cif the league
during the convention will be in
the Grunewald IIhtel. The lead
ers will meet there at 10 in the
morning on the day of the conven
tion, and the plan will ie outlined
for the convention's work. Mr.
Manning will return to the city on
the 16th to perfect the arrange
ments for the meeting.
'I'h1? following i+ the oflh4ial call
which he has issedl:
The right of the st:atts to a re
publican form of government and
the right of the citizens to a fair
vote and honest count is guaran
teed by the constitution.
The unrest cause l by the reign
of a ballot box stuffing oligarchy
in Alabama and other Southern
states has but recently aroused the
people to demand that their con
stitutional rights be given:
In conseluence of existing con
ditions, I have been delegated by
those who have awakened to patri
otic efforts to call a conference at
New Orleans, Jan. 18-19, for thd
purpose of organizing a Southern
ballot rights league and taking
such other steps as may insure con
stitutional rights to the people,
Delegations are urged to come in
response to the call from every
Southern state.
J. C. MANNING,
Montgomery, Ala.
Public Opinion.
Mr, Fditor: There is a questiomt
that is being discussed here a good
deal. It is: Does legislation have
anything to do with the present,

Now what a question I Of course'
it don't. Forevidence, don't every

every ausrer'say it don't ? Don't
every railway magnate say it don'tt'
Don't the standard oil agents say
it don't ? Don't the men who bribe

men who lobby at W ashington say
it don't. Don't the great food gam
blers say it don't. Don't all men'
living on public office say it don't.
With all this array of testimony,
how can a few foolish people think
laws have anything to do with the
prices of labor or labor products ?
Insteadot talking against such odds'
the farmers and planters ought to
learn how to raise low priced wheat
and cotton, and cut down their liv.
ing to the Chinese level and vote'
the old party tickets. Funny how
a few poor farmers shbould question
