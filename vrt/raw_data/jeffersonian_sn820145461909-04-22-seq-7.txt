Party sprang up that I got on it with
both feet and lam still on it. I am
going to stay on it till the last hope
is gone. I have voted for Thos. E.
Watson every time he ran for office,
and will do so again if an opportunity
presents itself. I am no Democrat
and never was one. The 14th and 15th
Amendments kept me from voting the
Republican ticket, so I did not vote
with either of the corrupt parties.
Since the Populist fused with both
the old parties and lost (and I was
opposed to any fusion).
I have been reading your paper and
magazine through the kindness of
friends and I have also been reading
Socialist literature. But I can not see
the result if the Socialists win. In
other words I don’t understand it as
I wish. Though the truth of the
matter is I had rather risk it lifting
us from under the fangs of the money
power than either one of the two old
parties. But why not let the Popu
lists and all the laboring classes hold
a convention and reorganize? I think
the time now ripe for the Populists
to reorganize in every State in the
Union and advance in a solid body
against the greed and graft that is
daily clutching the laborers and slow
ly but surely pressing them to the
wall.
In conclusion let me say, that I
hope for a speedy reorganization of
the Populist Party.
Respectfully,
R. I. Thompson.
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.
R. No. 2, Shelby, N. C.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Friend: I have been reading in
The Jeffersonian what you say about
foreign missions, and I think you
1 ‘hit the nail on the head.”
I think that we should let our lights
shine more at home; get right here
first —show the heathen that we have
something better than they have, then
it will not take so much free bread,
clothing, etc., to convert them. I
notice Bro. Scoville says “more
anon. ’ ’ I sure am anxious to hear
from him again, if that dose you gave
him April first does not finish him.
If it takes $77 to convert a Geor
gian, what does it cost to convert a
North Carolinian?
Yours very respectfully,
Marvin Blanton.
Rush the subscriptions along, boys.
Get our agents’ commission and win
a prize, too.
HAD RATHER BE IN MINORITY
AND BE RIGHT.
Route 3, Pocahontas, lowa.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: As my subscription to the
two Jeffersonians, the monthly and
the weekly, will expire in about a
month, I will send you a post office
order for renewal, for if I waited
till my time expired I might not have
the money to get an order with. It is
not necessary for me to say that I like
your papers. If I did not like them
I would not renew. I believe that
I am the only man who voted the
People’s Party ticket in our precinct
last November. I was urged to vote
for Bryan, because, as I was told, the
Populists, though right, had no
chance to win. I replied that all you
Democrats can do in this State
(Iowa), is to stand up and be counted,
for Bryan can not carry the State.
I think that it is poor policy for a
man to vote for what he does not
want, and it is very poor satisfaction
even if he gets it. I would rather
stand up and be counted among those
whom I believed were right, even if
their cause was hopeless, and they
constitute a very small minority, than
to be numbered with those whose
best credentials were in a big crowd.
If it be true, as Mr. Greene wrote
you, that hundreds of your readers
were offended at your attitude on
the foreign missions question, you can
depend upon it that I was not one of
them. I was glad to know that some
one who had so much better command
and language than I, had the courage
to say just about what I have wanted
to say for a good while. If I have
any fault to find with what you have
said, it is that you are not radical
enough.
Friendly commerce is the most
potent missionary. Education, a
knowledge of facts, is the great civi
lizer. It is useless to take one super
stition from a people and give them
another.
I remain as ever just one of your
true friends and admirers,
W. F. Brown.
LET’S KEEP FIGHTING.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Sir: Enclosed please find money
order for one dollar, for which please
send the two Jeffersonians to Mood
H. Smith, Oxford, Ga.
Well, if folks keep “a-readin, ”
your two papers they will absorb
some political sense after a while.
Heard a preacher attempt to answer
you, but he did so by leaving the
impression that you said that there
was more Christianity in foreign lands
than here. This you did not say and
I am constrained to believe that the
good fellow did not so understand.
Have you noticed Uncle Remus?
Also the Constitution’s comments?
Great God! Was not that your cry
throughout your camapign for the
Presidency? Then was the time to
speak. Why did not this paper give
you some encouragement then? Too
late after the battle is over. But such
is the reward of the man who fights
for principle. Let us just keep fight
ing and do the best we can.
Yours truly,
W. A. Ellington.
IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS SOUTH
IS SPINELESS.
Charlotte, N. C.
Dear Mr. Watson:
I suppose small favors these hard
time will be acceptable; if so, you
will find post-office order for four
dollars enclosed, for which please send
the weekly and magazine as directed
on another sheet.
I could get four times four sub
scribers if the people had any money,
but they cry hard times everywhere.
What little money they have they say
they are obliged to put into their
business and to live on, and when they
come at me that way, I cannot say a
word. It is an actual fact that our
people here are just living from hand
to mouth —I mean the common people,
and that is the class that wants your
literature. Would that we could get
them to see that it is their votes that
cause the hard times.
I talked with a preacher yesterday
Glje Jeffersonian
who sees the condition of the country
just as you and I see it, he is one in a
hundred. He said to me: “I would
like to read Mr. Watson’s magazine,
but my people are not coming up with
my salary, but I know their condition
and I can not press them.” He also
said that if Congress would pass a
law putting the whites and the blacks
on equality in ever} respect that the
South would not have the back-bone
to resent it, and I am of the same
opinion. Tell us what you think
about it.
In regard to organization: You sug
gest counties and States holding mass
meetings, and ask the opinion of
others. It might be all right in
Georgia, but it would not do in North
Carolina, for the machine Democrats
would side-track the movement every
time.
Your friend,
J. P. Alexander.
PROUD OF HIS HOME TOWN.
Lockhart, S. C.
To Hon. Thomas E. Watson:
If you see fit, please publish this,
as I would like for these people here
to see something from their home
town.
This is a beautiful location for a
mill; magnificent water power on the
Broad river. The people are more
intelligent than the average mill folks,
and all who have read your paper
or magazine are highly pleased with
both, and admire your rearless way
of telling the truth. There are about
two thousand inhabitants, with eight
hundred on the mill pay-roll. We
have good men to work under, from
the president down.
Hoping you will continue your good
work of education and that you will
finally win, I beg to remain,
Yours truly,
W. H. Sills.
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM IOWA
“GREENBACKER.”
Rudd, lowa.
Brother Thomas Watson:
I hereby enclose two dollars for the
two Jeffersonians. lam the same old
greenbacker of 1876. On the 13th
day of March, I arrived at my 89th
mile post. My rheumatism keeps me
from doing much writing, and my eye
sight is growing worse all the time.
I don’t know whether you will be able
to read this, but I shall have to give
up writing. I will take the papers
as long as I am permitted to remain
on earth.
I remain as ever your firm friend,
in the fight fox* the masses of the
people. I have been in this fight
since 1876, but my time for work in
this fight is ended.
From your friend and brother,
Thos. A. Laskey.
KIND ENCOURAGEMENT.
Halcyondale, Ga., April 3, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My dear Sir: I have just received
your Jeffersonian paper and read your
piece on missionary work in foreign
mission fields. I think it the best
and most appropriate for this age I
have ever read. Think we ought to
encourage you more in your great
work of educating the people on all
questions.
