to radicalism are cordially invited

Modern Judases.
People, and particularly christian
people, have never yet ceased to as
sewiate the name of this individ
unal with that of everything despi
cable to the human understanding.
Thie chosen companion and intimate
follower of the son of God, who hand
but few to love him when upon earth,
he betrayed him, to his enemies in
the hour of his darkest need. In do
ing so, perhaps he might be excused
upon the ground of fulfilling the pro
phetic expressions of the learned
lovers and serveres of God who hafd
gone ages before the appearance of
Christ; perhaps some little of his
grievou sin might be overlooked,
from the fact that he but worked out
a part of the plan of man's salvation.
But Judas can never lI forgiven for
having introduceel into the world the
damning crime of treachery.
His name will be linked to that
crime as long as time shall last. He
betrayed, it is true, but a single per
son, that person was, however, a God
-a God who had given Himself as a
willing sacrifice to propitiate the an
ger of the Father against his erring
children.
Have any of our friends looked
around them to discover how lmaln
Judases are among us to-day-to see
how many have followed the example
and.imitated the crime of the recre
ant Apostle. We doubt that they
have.
It God Ao Ilved the people of this
world, that he gave his only son for
them, and lie was betrayed, and that
betrayal was so great a sin-what
must be the enormity of the offence
whien collUitted upon the ohbjects of
that salvation. And still they pass
us every day, smiling like the publi
can, and thanking God, no doubt,
they are not as other men.
Look at your Lougstreet's, your At
kinson's, your Mliseby's ; Judases all,
aind still they "live long and prosper."
Coine to our own Stateand see Wells,
Anderson, and a host of lesser lights,
creeping like slimy worms across
Louisiana's fair fame, poluting with
death, moral and physical, everything
they touch.
Never yet was there a people, strug
gling for liberty, but that had be.
trayers; never yet was cause so just
but that amid its fungas growth some
Arnold was to be found, but no cause
has had so many Judases, "ready to
betray with a kiss, their home, coun
try and kindred, as the South and
Southern people.
Like toad-stools,, they have been
called into being by the magic wand
of the money-power. Men there are,
who have sold body and soul to the
enemies of every principle of their
existance, to every tradition of their
manhood, and that too, for a mere
mess of pottage. You wonder how
Judas looked and acted; look around
you and see his counter-part io your
midst, and you have the picture.
Dead to every feeling of honor;
their black souls seared to the scorn
of all true noblemen, they sneak
through your communities well con
tent to finger the few pieces of silver,
the price-money for their betrayal.
Is it not singular that God, with ar
thunderholt, does not cleave to earth
the vile creatures, who carry their
Ihypocracy even to the altar's foot.
Well might we exclaim,
Is there uot some ehosen curse,
Some hidden thunder in the stores of
heaven,
Red with uncommon wrath, to blast the
Who owes his greatness to his eountry's
ruin ?
And alas! we find many-how many
we care not to say, that every day are
the silent apologists or open defenders
of these miscreants. Are they less
criminal than the Judases? Were the
enlploye's of the Savior's betrayer
less guilty than he?
They may say they condemn these
men ! "These fellows are pretty good
fellows, and we may get something
out of them." Alh! are you not then
compounding felony-what! you at
tempt to reprove the robber by ap
proving thie robbery.
This conduct is auwise, is sinful;
it is no good line to persue, and hon
est men will condemn it.
Let their sins be their own. Let
them live if they can, in any honest
communiity where kiqwnu, wheq the
people "come by their rights," which
occurrance iss as ure as the sun rises
and sets. Judlas hias met his final
doom, they have their own punish
ment within thlemselves ; for
The man who rises on his comntry's ruin,
Lives in a crowd of foes, himself the
chierf;
In vain his power, in vain his pomp and
pleasure.
His lguilty thoughts, those tyrants of the
soul,
8teal in unseen, and stab him in his tri
umph.

little to grin at.
un~hwribe to the Vindicator,
The Muttering Storm.
Notwithstanding the severe lesson
given the radical rulers of Louisiana
last year, the many, many warnings
they have had; it seems they are all
but bent upon provoking the whites"
to madness. No heed has been paid
the manly and open protests of the
whites, save in the way of unifultlled,
promises ; the powers that be, go on
appointing, with a devilish malidous
ness, men, totally incompetent, to of
ficial position, who are morally and
socially degraded beyond expression.
These men are the custodians of or
der, the executors of law, and it is
expected that intelligent white men
must and shall assist these debased
villains to sustain law ! Stuff. No
such thing ought to be expected, for
it will never be the case.
The muttering storm is heard, this
time terrific, in East Feliciana, in
West Feliciana and elsewhere. The
warnings have been unseeded, now
the consequences must be taken. We
may look for this thing at any day
and anywhere where the occasion ex
ists. The sooner it comes the better
for peace and order. We can have
lone of either, with such vipers as
ramify our State officers. Cut-throats,
thieves, villains, fill all high places,
natil they are driven out-even by
force if necessary--no such thing as
peace, the observance of law and or
der can or should be expected.
Look to it citizens of Natehitoches,
that you do not falsify your declara
tions of last year. HE READY.

Packard's idea of goodl government,
as well as tlhat of his followers, con
sists in filling positions with friends
at a heavy expense to tihe tax payer;
giving good offices that pay well
those that may "come over" to him,
in the task, thankless but well aid
for, of "plerpetuating republican in
stitutions in Louisiana." Such, we
judge to' be the case from his late let
ter to Mr. Leonard.
This is, in truth, the whole aim
and idea of the partisans of the party
that has its head and front in the per
son of that astute politician, S. B.
Packard. Any white man, no matter
how devoid of personal ptileritude,
that joins in with the robber, and
they are generally so devoid that
none else will have them, immediately
receives and unblushingly takes the
reward. These Judas Iseariots will
have a lame time next year, iwe opine;
and instead of proving tihe bulwark
of tihe decaying hulk of Racical thiev
ery, they will be among tihe first to
hlunt cover in classic seclusion.
Louisiana does not require politi
ticians now, but patriots are in de
mand, of which Packard and his par.
ty are not.

Our able friend, the Carroll Watch
man, has misunderstood us entirely ;
we ment to infer that, should the neo
gro, as a mass, be left to run the po.
litical mItachinery, to put in office,
himself or his carpet-bad and scakawag t
friends, all is lovely and the goose a1
hamngs high. But the beauty of this si
scene is changed instanter, should any ti
attempt be malde to introduce native w
intelligence and personal honesty into ci
thei'r good graces. (Voting grace we
mean.) p
If we mistake not, the extreme vir- "
tue (f) and lovely acts (I) of the great ri
and good colored voters of that par. b
ish were amply illustrated by the 11
frauds perpetrated by their leaders in ti
the elections of last year, and also by u
their choice of such christian (t) he- fi
roes as George Benham, E-s-q r., to
the State Senate. As to the "wisdom" c
of the Democratic leaders of Carroll, 11
we have not the least doubt. Their ti
political intelligence was "made man- ti
ifest" rast year, and we are' only A
.grieved because the whole State does p
not persue their " judicjons" policy- a
especially if the whites desire carpet. d
bag or negro rulers.
Seriously, does tfm Watchman sup. 1
pose for an instant, that the negroes tl
of Carroll are any more virtuous, ii
have any more political wisdom, tlhan a
those of this or other parishes; are tl
they any less susceptable to thie in- p
fluence of bad and designing men h
than other colored men.
We do not know them personally, p
but we venture to affirm, that there is fi
not one particle of difference between a
them and ours. They all work well, a
who do work, but it Ihas been our mis- a
fortune to see some of the very best,
aye, many of tlhem, doing everything
in their power to provoke i.conflict.
The negro was not at first so much
to blame; we forgave himi then, on
the ground of his ignorance, but that m
excuse has become stale. The men p
hIe clings too are such as decend to o
his level, at least all we have seen o
are suach, although the "wise and ju- ti
dicious," of Carroll parish, may have c
discovered the "hidden art" of atlh
once etlerating the colored man to the A
posiltion of a citizen of sound politi- a
cal wisdom, an object thie white citi
zen has as yet, with all his opportuni- o
ties, not attained. a
The New Orleans Picajune of a
late date advertises the platform d
of the new Republican party. It's i
newness will be recognized when
we state that 8. B. Packard is to
run the machine.
We are of the opinion that few,
if any, will be deceived by thiis ,
change of costume in the old play,
nevertheless, it is strange that tl
Packard and his crowd should e
take the white citizens of the a
Union to be so green as to sup- d
pose any good could come of any- O
thing they touched, or that any *
hope could be entertained of their
adhering to any'set of principlers
outside of the "loaves and fishes." i
Acrobating, when not attended
iwith the destruction of the property
of another, is quite amusing to some.
But when no heed is paid to private
property and It is wantounly broken
up or defaced, thie matter, to thie pub
lie, becomes a nuisance. Thie impo
sing stone which belonged to Mr. G r
Messi, has been on St. Denis street,
near tihe side-walk, for some months,
it was bought by this office on'Tues
day last and that night outr kind
friends innocently destroyed it.
Imposing stones are cheap (not over t
thirty dollars each) and as we are t
so "bloated by rich" we suppose we I
can stand it, at least we will be com
pelled to, until we find out who did it, (
wlhen we will see if the cost will not I

The New Orleans Picajlone don't
like hanging the cotton sttalers or
burning out the stolen cotton, buyers,
but "counsels the law." If the Pica.
ynne will travel the State for a few
weeks and see what a farce the law
is, it would have less to say of it.

"proof was strong as holy writ,'
whereupon, the accused, to cut milt
ters short, as his attorney could no
longer go on in the face of such evi
dence as was adduced, acknowledged
his guilt, when the Judge instructed ý
the jury to find accordingly. This~
enlightened (t) body retired, and up- I

John Gair, a notorious radical ari
tator and robber, of E-) Feliciana,
and his sister-in-law attemupted to, it
seems, or did, poison: a gentleman of
that parish a few days since, and they
were both killed by the infuriated
citizens.
Pig-headed Antoine got up a big
pow-row, with Packard and Beck
with and at first decided to "ride a
raid" with the faumed (f) Metropolitan
brigade into the interior, but they
thought better of it, wisely we
think, and concluded to send Dibble
up with a stenographer and make a
first class bloody shirt report.
The people of East and West Feli
ciana, as well as East and West
Baton Roage, are much excited, and
the New Orleans papers tell us that
they are not prepared to stand Mr.
Antoine's valiant militia. The iases
particularly says that serious trouble
will occur should such a thing be
done.
We were of the opinion that the
lets had about enough given them
the 14th September, 1874, althoughl
if a reminder is desired, let them, by
all means, go into thie counltry, where
the people have .about as much res
pect for Antoine's militia as they
have for himself.
Place men in position that thie peo
pile have confidence in and respect1
for, and they will cheerfully assist in
sustaining law and order; but withl
