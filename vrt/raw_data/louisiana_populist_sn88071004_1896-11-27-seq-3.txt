Personal Mention.
Mr. R, L. Lee of Barkley, was in
towjl Monday.
Mr. J. H. Williams of Montgom
ery, was in town last Saturday.
dMr. G. J. Trichel of ward 4. was
in town Monday.
Mr. J. T. Johnson taking advant
age of the excursion rates, made a
flying trip to New Orleans this
week, returning Tuesday.
Government by Injunction.
Instead of incurring the expen-,c
hard work and worry of a square
toed fight for prohibition in the
recent election, some of the load
ers, backed by a half dozen law
yers, decided on the much easier
plan of government by injunction.
recently established by their pat
ron saint Grover Cleveland.
Hence on last Saturday every
body in any way connected with
the conduct of the election on the
following Monday was enjoined
from doing anythine of the kind,
and so last Monday the commis
sioners and clerks appointed to
hold said election were kept from
doing so by order of the court.
But the people present at the polls
on the morning of the election ap
pointed their own commissioners
and clerks and proceeded to hold an
election with the result elsewhere
stated.
The matter will now be tried in
court, and the people will have
but little to do with determining
the result.
The election will no doubt be
thrown out on pretty much the
same principle,and mostly by the
same people that officiated m the
steal of this parish from the Pop
ulists last Spring, and while we do
not approve of it, we are compell
ed to emphasize the fact, to those
most interested on the losing side
this time, that when any political
party is allowed to run rough shod
over the rights of another party
the ring leaders of that same par
ty will not hesitate to trample un
der foot the rights of any faction
of Its own members who dares to
oppose the bosses.
To speak a little more plainly :
the Democrats who favor licenses
in this parish all voted the straight
Democratic ring boss ticket last
Spring, and then either stood by
or helped to count out the Popu
lists. Now they are going to be
treated to a dose of the same kind
of medicine by the same bosses,
and will realize how nice it is to
have a few heads to run a big par
ish, and also how pleasant it is to
be.aainst the bosses.
That useless and expensive nuis
saes, the Inspector of Weights and
Measures gathered in his shekels
here last Friday. He took away
Sr10 for each pair of scales, and
--mething else for yardsticks and
p-st mps, sad no one save himaelf
i any better of for it. This oMee
is nsafl only to the maechinery of
pelties.
A very pretty and impressmve
Thlsakagiving service was held at

day by the communicants of that
