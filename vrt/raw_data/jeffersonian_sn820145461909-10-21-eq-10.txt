A Suggestive Letter and a
Reply to Same
Dear Sir: —I have just read your
editorial in this week’s Jeffersonian
entitled, “Mr. Hoke Smith and the
Atlanta Journal.’’ It amuses one
who never supported such a propa
ganda. Instead of all of the white
people being allowed to register and
vote, and all of the negroes, or
ninety per cent, pf them, being dis
franchised, it now seems that some
of the white people may be disfran
chised, “automatically” or somehow.
And that, too, in the very trap that
was set for “Cuffy”, when “Cuffy
wasn’t doin’ nothing, neither”.
If, however, there is no one caught
napping except the “reform-anti
anything-Hoke Smith’’ crowd, it
would be more laughable than seri
ous, especially to the “let-well
enough-alone” crowd.
If I remember correctly, your in
fluence in 1905 and 1906 was on the
side that made such legislation as
you now criticize possible. That,
however, does not help the situation,
and is not what prompted me to
write.
Why not repeal the whole thing,
the granddaddy clause with the
rest? There is too much power vest
ed in the registrars. The white pri
mary has generally answered every
purpose in this part of the State
since I have been voting (nine
years). Suppose you put the regis
tration and the election thirty or
sixty days apart, and there should be
an election in which the whites were
equally divided and the blacks
should hold the balance of power,
wouldn’t the destiny of the election
be in the power of the registrars?
The Journal blundered in stating
the law; the law itself is a blunder,
for human nature has generally
blundered ■where too much power
was vested in one place.
Wouldn’t something like this be
better? Payment of taxes a pre
requisite for voting, for old and
young? Leave the payment of poll
tax optionary with the citizen?
Keep the defaulters list at the polls?
After two successive years on the de
faulters list, totally disfranchised?
Disabilities for non-voting removed
by a court of equity on good cause
shown, with such delay as would de
feat mercenary motives.
Such a law put in operation at the
time Hoke Smith made his Madison
speech would have already accom
plished more toward purging the
voters list than the educational
clause and granddaddy clause ever
will accomplish.
Give us a discussion of this in your
next Jeffersonian.
Your friend,
W. U. MOOTY.
LaGrange, Ga., Oct. 14, 1909.
Ed. Comment: I own up. Am
partly responsible for our being
where we are at. But my intentions,
which were good, are probably use
ful at the present time in supplying
pavement to the lower and warmer
regions.
Really, “us reformers” did pretty
well at first. We did about and
killed a bear or two. We had the
Sepoys wondering what would hap
pen next. The jolt that we gave to
TJcffersonlan
our Wall Street bosses was felt
throughout “the system”.
But the serpent crawled in—the
shape the temptation assumed being
senatorial ambition. This luscious
red apple tempted Mister Hoke and
he did eat. That was the origin of
all our woes. Reform work came to
a halt. In vain did I warn the Hard
wicks and the Smiths. In repeated
personal interviews with Hardwick,
and by frequent editorials in this pa
per. I did all in my power to keep
the Democratic members of the firm
up to the mark.
But they wouldn’t listen to me.
They began to boast that they had
taken my following away from me,
and that they asked me no odds.
The defective, dangerous laws
which we have been discussing were
passed after the dissolution of the
firm of Hardwick, Smith & Watson.
Don’t forget that.
I have said all along that these
disfranchisement laws would never
stand the strain of a hot contest.
The registrars are really czars. In
a heated and close campaign they
would do what “the men who con
trol” desire and demand.
My own suggestion would be this:
Let the State pass an act restrict
ing the ballot to the white male
adults who prior to the election
have paid their taxes. Then, if the
negroes fight the law, take it to the
Supreme Court, and test the Fifteenth
Amendment. That amendment was
not legally adopted, and I’ve often
wondered why it has never been di
rectly assailed—just as I’ve wonder
ed why the importers have never
made the constitutional point
against the protective principle. All
such tariffs as have succeeded the
antebellum acts have been uncon
stitutional. But no one directly at
tacks them. Were I the attorney of
one of the great agricultural socie
ties, I’d make a desperate, direct as
sault on the abominable, unlawful
and confiscatory tariff. T. E. W.
LIKES THE NAPOLEON.
Dear Sir:—l have just finished
reading with great pleasure and
profit your “History of Napoleon”.
It is the best I have ever read.
I notice that you do not speak of
him as he was often spoken of, “The
man of destiny.” Two thousand,
three hundred and three years prior
to his birth his whole career was ac
curately described by the prophet
Daniel, chapter eleven, verses thirty
six to forty-five.
Very truly yours,
ROBERT RANSON.
