Public Opinion Throughout the Union
TWO TRACTS.
To attract votes, silent votes, Mr.
Bryan is circulating two political doc
uments of a strictly personal nature.
One is the “Prince of Peace” ser
mon, which is mailed to members of
all denominations. It is expected to
do effective work among the reli
gious and benevolent, to whom it is
a bid to support Mr. Bryan as a tru
ly virtuous man of lofty ideals and
altruistic purposes —the good man who
could do no wrong.
The other document is an account
of Mr. Bryan’s visit to the Vatican,
in which he gives an appreciative and
pleasing picture of Pius X. This is
sent only to Catholic voters.
There is no reason why any one
should; resent Mr. Bryan’s unctuous
solicitations to vote for him for reas
ons of religion. They will react upon
him, for the American people hate a
humbug.—N. Y. Sun.
The Independence party represen
tatives in this city are very busy try
ing to get enough names to their pe
tition to have their ticket placed on
the official ballot. No such petition
has yet been filed with the Board of
Elections, and unless it is by this
afternoon the ticket will not go on
the ballot. That the Independence
people seem to think the situation
desperate appears evident from the
fact that one of them yesterday
placed a high box in front of a sa
loon on East Sixth street, near Vine.
He stopped many men passing by and
asked the following questions: “Are
you a citizen of this state and coun
ty? Have you voted at either the
Republican or Democratic prima
ries?” If the answers were “yes”
to the first question and “no” to the
second, the solicitor offered the citi
zen three cents for his signature to
the petition, which was laid out on
the box. There was no dearth of
“bums” about the solicitor. —Cincin-

POLITICAL TOADYISM.
The two leading political parties
in this country are like a lot of toads
in a puddle, a few big ones and a
lot of little ones, the little ones try
ing to ape the big ones. When the
big toads paddle around in clear
water the little ones do the same, and
when the big ones go to kicking up
the mud the little fellows scream with
delight and rile up the whole puddle.
When the big toads in one puddle
fail to originate enough diversion for
themselves and little followers, they
look over into some other puddle to
see what some big toad there is
doing to interest the little ones in
that puddle. If he finds the big toad
in that puddle doing something of
sufficient interest to delight the
little ones around him ,then he apes
the big toad in the other puddle and
the little ones around him again
scream with delight and immediately
resolute their big toad as the greatest
toad of them all.
In 1892, the big toads of the Re
publican party declared: “The
American people from tradition and
interest favor bimetallism and de
mand the use of both gold and
silver as standard money,” and the
little toads shouted themselves
hoarse, pointing with pride to the
honesty of their big toads.
In 1896, the big toads declared for
bimetallism with an international
string to it; and the little toads went
wild with delight at the broad states
manship manifested by their big
toads.
In 1900, the big toads with blare
and trumpet shouted from the house
tops that national honor had been
vindicated by the establishment of
the single gold standard, and the
enthusiasm of the little toads could
not be restrained for days and nights
shouting their praises for the con
sistency, honesty and integrity mani
fested by their big toads.
In 1904, big and little toads all
joined hands and circled around the
golden calf singing praises to the big
toads whose foresight in creating the
golden calf had preserved them from
all danger of financial panics, and
they now had a dollar that was good
in Europe.
In 1907-8, the big and little toads
were all thunderstruck to suddenly
see the black clouds of a financial
panic hovering over them, and then
for the first time they began to
realize the golden calf created by the
big toads was a false god. But the big
toads immediately got to work and
by assuring the little toads they
could plaster up the rents in the
golden calf with paper asset cur
rency secured by their own deposits,
the deluded little toads again went
off happy shouting glory be to the
wisdom of our big toads.
In 1893-5, the big toads of the
Democratic Party said the golden
calf was the only true god, and the
little toads shouted amen.
In 1896, the big toads of regener
ated Democracy said that free un
limited sixteen to one was the real
god that would preserve them from
all evil, and the little toads again
shouted amen and placed W. J.
Bryan, the peerless one, on a high
pedestal as the unsullied saint who
would guide and lead them to ever
lasting happiness and power.
In 1900, the big toads confidently
proclaimed again that free unlimited
was the only true god, and the peer
less one was its true representative.
The little toads again shouted hurrah
for W. J. and free unlimited, see how
staunch and true our peerless one
stands for the only true god.
In 1904, the big toads of Democ
racy planted themselves squarely be
side of the golden calf, declaring it to
be the only true god. W. J. the
peerless one at first halted but finally
joined the multitude leading the
little toads and advising them to bow
down to the golden calf which would
carry them to glory and to victory.
In 1908, the little toads of De
mocracy are all at sea, for the big
toads including the peerless one have
not had the moral courage to say
whether the golden calf, free unlimit
ed or some other is the true god
to lead them on to glory, and if any
one can tell which god Democracy
will worship if the peerless one
should be elected, they can do more
than I can.

But while it may be fully estab
lished that no man with any fixed
opinion of his own on political
questions can ever eat any pie at the
Republican or Democratic political pie
counter, there is one consolation
open to all men, and that is: It is
better to be a man in a wilderness
than a mouse in a palace.

MR. BRYAN’S “MY RECORD.”
When Mr. Roosevelt gets after Mr.
Bryan with the big stick, the latter
parries the blows with “My Record.”
When the workingmen ask him wheth
er or no he called them “a lot of
public beggars,” his only answer is
“My Record.” What is this citadel,
this inner keep, to which Mr. Bryan
always retires when bested in the
open? Here are the cold facts coldly
told:
In 1890 Mr. Bryan is elected to
Congress as a Populist. The Demo
crats have a House majority, and Mr.
Bryan in 1891 becomes a Democrat.
For fear of “an old soldier element
along the Platte” —as he himself ex
pressed it —he refuses to vote in cau
cus for Speaker Crisp, who was an
ex-Confederate.
In this Congress Mr. Bryan was a
member of the Ways and Means Com
mittee. He professed also to be for
silver. He did nothing for either tar
iff or silver. He did nothing at all.
Mr. Bryan, in 1892, voted for Mr.
Weaver. Populist, against Mr. Cleve
land, the Democratic candidate, for
the White House. Looking after his
own interests, he lapsed from his new
Democracy into half Populism, and
returned to Congress on a mule tick
et —half Populist, half Democrat.
He again took his place on the Ways
and Means Committee, of which Mr.
Wilson was chairman.
Behind locked doors, what was Mr.
Bryan’s committee “record” in the
clause-by-clause construction of the
Wilson bill? He voted to free list
raw sugar because the Sugar Trust de
sired it. He voted for a high tariff
on refined sugar because the Sugar
Trust desired it. He did not dare
urge an income tax, lest it militate
against the revenue arguments being
made in support of a high tariff on
refined sugar.
Mr. Bryan voted to reduce the tax
on fine Havana tobacco $3,300,000 a
year. He voted to reduce the tax on
superior wines, brandies and spirits
$1,500,000. He voted $3,500,000 off
the tax on silk. He voted to cut
down the tax on kid gloves, jewelry
and sealskin $1,279,000. Off the tax
on superfine wools and broadcloth he
voted $18,000,000. Thus was he good
to the rich.
Also, when they presented their
views on tariff to the committee, Mr.
Bryan called the workers of America
“a lot of public beggars.”
Mr. Bryan made a deal with the
Populists in 1895 to stump Virginia
against Mr. O’Ferrell, the Democratic
candidate for Governor; and then
sidestepped the compact in a fright
when Mr. O ’Ferrell defied him to
keep it. He sought the silver propa-
ganda ’s nomination for President in
1895. but was put aside in favor of
Mr. Sibley—Mr. Sibley, of Standard
Oil and Pennsylvania.
In 1896 Mr. Bryan came seeking in
St. Louis the silver Republican bolt
ers’ nomination for Vice-President.
The bolters named no ticket.
Mr. Bryan went to Chicago in 1896
pledged to Mr. Bland. He made his
cross-of-gold speech and was himself
named for the Presidency. Mr.
Bryan was beaten in that campaign.
Mr. Bryan started The Commoner.
Subscriptions flowed in, 180,000 of
them, at a dollar a head. Mr. Bryan
began to grow rich. He lectured for
churches 'and charged the churches
$l5O a lecture. He made speeches at
conn tv fairs —and charged $l5O a
speech. As recently as the late At
lanta celebration he made a political
speech for himself—and charged the
Atlanta committee S3OO and expenses.
Between 1896 and 1900 Mr. Bryan
accepted $12,500 —by his own sworn
testimony—from the besotted Mr.
Bennett. Then he secretly drew Mr.
Pnnnnff’s will—Bryan’s wife, for the
better secrecy of it, doing the type
writing—hv which he was to haVe
$20,000 to give away and $50,000 for
himself. Mr. Bennett died, and Mr.
Bryan fought through three Connect
’courts to collect the money from
Mr. Bennett’s widow. Mr. Brvan did
not get the $50,000, being defeated
horse, foot and guns.
In 1900 Mr. Bryan tried another
Jack Cade campaign, and took anoth
er drubbing.
Tn 1904. while pretending to ac
quiesce in Mr. Parker’s nomination,
he did his sly best to make certain
the Esopus one’s defeat. Mr. Bryan
takes advantage of the situation to
work upon the fears of Mr. Thomas
Fortune Ryan, who sends him $20,-
“Mr. Bryan’s Senate cam
paign ’ —to keep him from attacking
Mr. Parker.
Mr. Bryan goes to Europe. He re
turns to declare for public ownership
of railways—and abandons the declar
ation as soon as it is made.
Mr. Bryan, having advantage of
Mr. Roosevelt’s war on Standard Oil,
makes secret alliance with that great
felon of the companies. It was from
Standard Oil he got Mr. Haskell, who
helped him draw the Denver platform,
with all its “omitted issues,” omitted
in favor of the trusts.
Mr. Bryan made Mr. Haskell, of
Standard Oil, his treasurer. When
Mr. Hearst uncoverol that devious
gentleman’s Standard Oil affiliations
Mr. Bryan, with a real show of vir
tue horrified, kicked Mr. Haskell out.
But Mr. Bryan did NOT kick out the
money Mr. Haskell had collected.
Tn nlace of Mr. Haskell Mr. Bry
an made Mr. Ridder his treasurer—
Mr. Ridder, a professional labor hater
and labor fighter, as is also Mr. Bry
an’s manager, Mr. Mack.
There, down to date, you have that
marvelous record behind which Mr.
Bryan, when frightened, is so prone
to hide.
What has he done?
Nothing.
Mr. Bryan has BEEN things, SAID
things, DONE NOTHING at all. Yes,
