THE HOUR.
For I may walk unguided and alone
At morning glory and at high noon
tide,
At sun-set, and in even’s homing
hour;
But when the slow red moon climbs
high,
And opal mists trail slowly by.
And birds trill softly in their new
made nests,
My footsteps falter, and I pause,
A-thrill to hear thee coming then,
dear heart.

THE LUCK OF NUMBERS.
By T. Cridland Evans.
To the primitive mind there is often
a mystical connection between a name
and the thing it signifies. A savage,
for instance, will refuse to tell his
name, for fear that a wizard will hear
of it and so obtain power over him.
Many ancient cities had secret names,
never to be mentioned to strangers,
lest the city be imperilled. Rome had
a secret name, which is thought to
have been Quirium, though the matter
is naturally uncertain.
The notion that certain numbers
are unlucky has probably arisen from
some such chain of reasoning, modi
fied by the fact that numb'rs do pos
sess many curious properties which
savor of the uncanny to any one with
out a mathematical education. Con
sider one of the properties of the num
ber 9. If the order of the digits ex
pressing a number be reversed, and
the number so obtained be deducted
from the original number, the remain
der will be 9 or a multiple thereof,
and being a multiple, the sum of its
digits will be 9. Take for instance
the number 21; reverse the digits and
you have 12; subtract 12 from 21 and
the remainder is 9. Take 63, ’reverse
the digits and subtract 36; you have
27, a multiple of 9, and 2 and 7 equal
This is very mysterious to the un
educated, and it is not surprising that
entities with such properties should
be regarded as being able to
influence the fortunes of mankind.
One of the commonest forms of
number-charms is the magic square,
such as the following:
4 9 2
3 5 7
8 16
These numbers can be added horizon
tally, vertically or diagonally with the
same result. This particular square is
often used in the East. Hindoo sor
cerers write it on the porcelain dish
which is afterward filled with water
to be used for 11 scrying,” or what is
commonly known as crystal-gazing.
Magic squares used to be placed on
the walls of buildings for luck. In
pleasant imitation of this old custom,
a 16 figure has been carved over one
of the entrances of the beautiful
Hackley School near Tarrytown, New
York.
Odd numbers are usually consider
ed lucky. Just why this should be,
it is difficult to say; though a clue
Under The Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
may possibly be found in the Pytha
gorean doctrine that the unit repre
sented the Divinity, as creator of all
things. It therefore also stood for
Harmony and Order, whereas the duad
signified Confusion and Disorder and
the strife of Good and Evil.
These speculations can be pursued
in “The Pythagorean Triangle” by
the Rev. G. Oliver, D. D., and what
ever their worth, the fact remains
that uneven numbers are regarded as
lucky. The belief is of great an
tiquity and reference is- made to it
by Virgil in the Eighth Ecologue and
by Pliny, who comments on it with
some amazement. Chinese pagodas,
or sacred towers, built by devout per
sons with the object of improving the
luck of the neighborhood, have al
ways an odd number of stories, vary
ing from . 3 to. 13. In Siam every
house must have an uneven number
of rooms, windows, steps and doors.
The most famous work of Arab litera
ture is the Thousand and One Nights.
A Russian term for a sly scamp is a
person who knows the 77 tricks. Even
in this country we lease properties for
99 and 999 years.
Three, as emblematic of the Trinity,
has always been considered a sacred
number, for long before the Christian
era was worship paid to the Triune
God. For this reason triple time in
music was once considered the perfect
time and the only suitable tempo for
ecclesiastical music. We still say,
“The third time never fails.” When
two misfortunes happen, it is often
said that a third is imminent. Pian
ists have a superstition that the break
ng of two piano strings is shortly to
be followed by a third.
Groups of three abound. In Holy
Writ are the three sister graces,
Faith, Hope and Charity; and in my
thology are trios of graces, fates,
furies, Parcae, Gorgons and Norns.
The number seven has ever been
regarded as having a peculiar mystic
significance and its manifold virtues
have been set forth in elaborate mono
graphs. Both in the Scriptures and
in heathen mythologies has this num
ber been pre-eminent. Its merits may
be of an astronomical, or rather as
trological origin, as the following
quatrain from Robert Vilvain’s
“ Enchiridium Epigrammatum,” 1654,
will illustrate:
“Saturn is first, next Jove, Mars
third in place;
The Sun in Midst, fifth Venus runs
her race,
Mercury sixth, Moon lowest and last
in band,
The planets in this rank and manner
stand.” •
We see that the planets were sup
posed to be. seven in number. As
trologists divided the life of man into
seven ages and each of these ages was
under the dominion of its own par
ticular planet. The phrase “to be
in the seventh heaven” is probably
derived from the Ptolomaic system
which taught that the planets were
carried around by as many crystal
spheres, the seventh’being the highest.
Many are the groups of sevens to
»
be found in antiquity. There were
seven 'wise men of Greece, seven gates
of Thebes, seven sleepers of Ephesus.
Pharoah dreamed of seven lean kine
and seven fat kine; seven priests
blowing seven horns walked around
Jericho for seven "days. Mr. A. H.
Layard found among the clay tablets
of Ninevah many incantations in
which the number seven occurs fre
quently. Rossetti’s Blessed Damozel
“had three lilies in her hand
And the stars in her hair were seven.”
Rossetti, however, may have given her
this particular number of stars be
cause it chanced to rhyme with
heaven. The fact that seven is the
only common English word that does
rhyme with heaven probably accounts
for its frequent apearance in poetry.
There is one exception to the no
tion that odd numbers are lucky and
that is the number thirteen, which has
been regarded as exceedingly un
lucky by everybody, with the possible
exception of the Mayans of Yucatan.
See Dr. D. G. Brinton’s “A Primer
of Mayan Hieroglyphics.” The ori
gin of this prejudice against thirteen
is 'wrapped in mystery. Some inves
tigators have found it in the Scandi
navian story of Loki, the Principal of
Evil and chief author of human mis
fortunes, accompanied by 12 Aesir or
demigods; others seek its derivation
in the Last Supper of Christ, where
Judas is sometimes represented as
the thirteenth guest. But the fact
that the thirteenth year was con
sidered of evil import by the ancient
Hindoos would invalidate both theo
ries. At any rate, the belief exists
and is in a flourishing condition.
In Scotland thirteen is known as
the “Deil’s Dozen;” in Turkey the
popular dislike to it is so .great that
the word for thirteen is seldom used.
In Italy shrewd theatrical managers
have found it expedient to change the
numbers of box 13 to box 12A, and
in many streets of Rome and Flor
ence one may search iu vain for house
numbers between 12 1-2 and 14. The
authorities at Washington, D. C., re
ceived a formal petition from a gen
tleman asking leave to change the
number of his house from the omin
ous thirteen. On October 13, 1908,
some of Mr. Kammerstein’s opera
singers decided to await the morrow
before landing at New York, not wish
ing to “hoodoo” their chances of suc
cess. In France it is regarded a
breach of etiquette to have thirteen
guests at table. The Parisian
“sponger” is sometimes known as
the “quatorzieme,” his chief mission
being to occupy the fourteenth seat
at a dinner party.
This functionary does not exist in
America, but the need of him has been
acutely felt. At the thirteenth annual
dinner of the Thirteen Club of New
York, held January 13, 1895, at 7.13
o’clock, the custodian delivered an ad
dress, in which he said that at the
time of the club’s foundation, so
prevalent was the fear of the evil that
might ensue from the assembling of
thirteen persons, that when the requi
site number were seated at table, it
was found desirable to lock the doors
of the banquet hall, lest some faint
hearted soul should retire abruptly.
Opinions have differed as to whether
misfortunes were likely to befall the
whole company of thirteen persons
rash enough to dine together, or only
to the one leaving the room first after
the repast. Others believe that one
of the company is doomed to die be
fore the year is out. It might be
worth while to figure out the prob
abilities of the truth of this last no
tion: in a company of thirteen per
sons of average age, the death rate
may be one a year. Some people
think that the bad luck resulting from
thirteen at table can be dissipated by
the entire company rising together.
But, as a wit has said, the only oc
casion when thirteen plates at table
should cause disquietude is when the
food is only sufficient for twelve.
SWEET MOTHER EARTH.
Death paused awhile without my
ctoor;
I did not bid him enter in,
For joys of Paradise can nevermore
Seem sweeter than they seem, in
spite of sin
And woe, the joys of this dear earth;
Sweet earth, so wise and kind, so
full of gentle mirth,
Made soft by all the sorrow that un
derlies :
Dear mother earth, in thy deep eyes
Dwell things unutterable; thy secrets
but to learn,
Thy raptures fine to know, and feel
the thrill
Os thy soft mother-arms encircling
still, .
For this my heart doth ever yearn
And will alway, though I may hear
the flow
Os streams eternal, and hills of Para
dise may know.

COLORED DRESS CLOTHES.
The question has been put to us,
“Do you think colored dress clothes
for men are likely to become fashion
able?” Our reply has been in the
negative. Past attempts of this kind
have always ended in failure. -Some
20 years ago a very decided effort was
made to introduce wine color, green
and blue for evening dress; some
smart and novel styles were pro
duced, but they never got beyond the
model stage.—The Tailor and Cutter.
