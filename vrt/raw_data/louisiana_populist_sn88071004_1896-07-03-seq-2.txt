The Pui,l,ili.-Ls for the nllst unri
havre hNeen an ,rganiz:ation of far
mers n;ud workinelmen, the best
and purest elements of American
society. They have advocated re
form, particularly financial re
form, and their principles have
gained strength and power all over
the land. Men who have ridiculed
and abused the populists have been
a compelled to embrace and advocate
their principles which are founded
in eternal justice and right. The
consequence has been that the cause
of populism has grown stronger
than ever with each succeeding
eloction. )Defeat does not discour
age or divide them. Repeated
wrong and outrage binds them
closer together. Look at the pop
iulists in the fifth district. They
made a gallant fight in April for
Capt. Pharr and elected him with
their honest votes, but were rob
lel of the fruits of their victory.
But,. nothing daunted, the popu
lists all over the district rallied
bravely to the support of Benoit
and the result showed that they
are stronger than ever in this dis
trict.
It is so all over this land. They
are growing stronger every dlay;
stronger in numbers, stronger in
determination, zeal and ability,
stronger in hope and power of en
durance. They have already sev
en members in the United States
senate which is more than any
party of its age ever accomplished.
And these great men, like all the
offlicers elected by the populists,
reflect credit upon them. The
new iwrty is making a record that
commands the respect of the world.
Yet there are some fools that d&e
clare that these men are ready to
return to the machine party which
has maligned, traduced and out
raged them. Most of them quit
the democratic party because it
had degenerated into an intolerant
machine, governed by heelers and
bosses. They felt the crack of the
party lash wielded by foul hands.
They witnessed the attempts to
muzzle the press, to stifle free
speech, to suppress the will of the
people for the benefit of office
holding leeches who made private
property out of the party. They
saw personally placed above prin
ciple and party success above the
people's welfare.
Do you think these men who
rebelled against such practices will
ever return to political bondage
Why should they I Why shoul
they abandon the laurels and pa
tsiotis enthusuasm they are gaining
everywhere I Has the machine
improved t Do you think they
have gained conidence in demo
cratic pledges and platforms I Any
man who pretends to believe that
te populists will ever surrender
sad return will believe anything.
He would believe that Texas is
ready is to give her indepenJ
ence and return to allegiance to
Mexico. Perhaps it would be
bterto for her.-M J .
The bo r girl sighed as she
mounted her wheel,
And thought of the truth which

Brabster West's Letter.
landl's Streelt l:iailway 1 eal--Sil
ver Men Threatened-The Rem
edy - Why Grover I)eservec
Thanks.
Washington, D. C., June 2C,, 189,6.
The situation remans unchanged.
HIanna is keeping his hand over
McKinley's mouth to prevent any
utterance Iby that humbug an I of
fice seeker upon the financial ques
tion until the Democratic conven
tion has acted. (;rover Clevela:nd
has been fishing at the m.,uth of
the James river. His piscatorial
pursuits will be contined to Salt
Creek next year. Teller has said
nothing save that he is willing to
sul)port any tried and true friend
of silver for the Pro idency, and
does not desire the nomination him
self. Whitney and Iill have se
cured a gold delogation to the
Chicago convention from New
York state, but I am credibly in
formed that it was done with liffi
culty, for the farmers of western
New York are almost a unit for
free silver.
Many people may wonder why
Whitney gave up his trip to Europe
and so suddenly came to the front
in the light for goldbuggery. I
have the inside facts. About two
years ago a ldeal was entered into
whereby Cleveland, Whitney, La
mont, and several other adminis
tration men secured options upon
the franchises of the street rail
way systems in the large cities of
the country. European Jewish
financiers loaned them the money
necessary to buy the roads upon
cir agreement to repay it in gold.
There is the case in a nutshell. If
silver is remonetized, the Europe
an Jews who have cornered the
gold will not let it go except at a
heavy premium. The United States
as a commonwealth will not need
it, for all of our national obliga
tions are payable in coin (gold or
silver at our option). Thus the
usurers, who love an unearned dol
lar more than an assuranceu of eter
nal bliss, All exact the utmost
pound of flesh from those whose
obligations are made payable in
gold. Cleveland, Whitney, and
Lamont know the gang they are
dealing with, and fear ruin for
themselves if they do not disrupt
the silver forces. I can prove these
assertions.
This being the case, all the efforts
of the administration are being di
rected towards preventing a union
of the silver forces. It is no lon
ger with the gang a question of
whether they can get any more
money or loans from the gokhl con
spirators; it is a queston of avoid
ing being swallowed up themselves.
If the question were not so serious
for the country, the predicament
of Cleveland et al. would be laugh
provoking.
Th. administration cuckoos are
sending out letters to Southern
Democrats, appealing to them to
stay the silver tide, and threaten
ing that if they persist in their free
silver theories they need look for
no further financial aid in their
business enterprises from Eastern
capitalists. When their outstand
ing obligations are due, no fur
ther extension of time will be giv
en them, and they will be reqmred
to pay up or suder the consequen
es. They may turn to their free
silver friends in the West, but they
are apt to lad the latter class with
aout eapital, except what they ob
ain through their Eastern eon
nections. When their debts are
due their creditors will not be est
sted with 50so cents on the
iollar, ad the result is they
will demaupd dollar for dollar or
orelose4bhe mortgages they hold
aporn their propery. It is under
t.od that this i. the kind oflin
ax-Secretary Whitnr and is
mund memey assoiates will apply
in dealing with the ootherh re
=spmmlivufr at (gdcu. and it s
,ost.
W h regard to this I coasalted ,

Such being the law, it behooves
every man threatened as stated by

the conspirators were forced to
occupy the cells in which they now

1 While abusing Grover, people
should not forget that the nation
owes him a idebt of gratitude; for,
if it had not been for his bulhlo
zing, pig-headed way of forcinn
the gold standard down the throats
of the people, their present great
uprising might have been delayed
for another four years. In recog
nition of this service on his part,
some people are talking of raising
a popular subscription to buy himn
a coffin like that of Li Hung Chang,
concerning which I will write more

Free Silver means niuch to us.
but it isn't the only thing we need
to help the people. We nee d
many more reoforms. Just as well
think of food without water, fuel
without fire, justice without mercy
as to think of silver alone. Silver
and protection go hand in hand.
Adopt the Omaha platform and
help us to give the country some
thing else besides silver.
The Picayune is of the opin
ion that we are not in need of
nmoney at all, but that the. suffering
of the people anid the stagnation
of business come from a death
of "confidklence." Mulbrry Sellers
insisted that heat was mere imag
ination, and canme near freezing a
friendly visitor to death in trying
to demonstrate his theory.-ltem.
Things like to a third party are
like to each other. Isn't that so ?
Just see if you can find a flaw in
the following : The Republicans
are in favor of a gold standard,
some so-called Democratic papers
are in favor of the gold standard.
Therefore those papers are Repub
lican.
Drinking on Sunday is a sin, un
less it be done at the clubs, is
about the version of the Picayune.
In other words, the man who can
afford to pay club dues is O. K.,
but the poor devil has to do with
out.
On Saturday night while yatch
ing on Lake Ponchetrain, Miss
May Balfour, one of the belles of
New Orleans, fell overboard and
was drowned. Her body was dis
covered Monday.
Over a hundred men were buried
in a mine near Pillston, Pennsyl
vania, by a cave in on the 29th.
Let the old parties remember
that platform pledges must be
kept and not broken.
The People's party is a good deal
like the Irishman's fence. He
built it of stone and it was twice as
wide as it was high. He explain
ed that if it blew over it would be
higher than it ever was. Every
time the old parties turn the new
one over it appears about twice as
highas it was. It is now a condi
tion and not atheory that confronts
them.
A Call.
The People's rtExecutive
Committee of the 4th Co i.
al District is hereby cal to meet
at Natchitoohes, La., on July 14th,
1896, for the purpose of rolling a
nomiating convention, fixihe
repremsntation therein and other
bsine. It is urgently requested

mittee be had, as we regard the

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took (rover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a trampl
are most ludicrously rolsted, and
his conversations witt' farmers
and laboring men aboul the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 174 pages of laugh
provoking matter, and 4)0 full-pae,
illustrations of Clevelamn as a
tramp.
