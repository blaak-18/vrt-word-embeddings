(oughs and lung troubles lead to
contu;mution, loss of flesh and wasting
coulitiotm.
Of all the disease which afflict the
human race it is the most fatal.
Its ravages are by no means con
fined to thie lungs alone.
It attack=, in fact, almost every part
of the bIKid.
It casts a blacker shadow than in
temperance.
To check its ravages science for
many years labored in vain.
Is it possible even to-day to cure
every case of consumption?
Let us look the melancholy truth
straight in the face.
It is not possible.
But, qut of the 700 lives sacrificed
every day, 500 may be saved, and T.
A. Slocum, the distinguished manu
facturing chemist, has discovered a
way to do it.
f It is with a solemn sense of responsi
bility for his words that the great
chemist announces through the medium
of the public press that he has found
an ab.oluto cure for consumption in
any case where the patient is not act
ually dying.
Thousands of witnesses could be
brought forward-whose testimony is
incontrovertible-to prove not only that
the newly discovered Slocum System of
Scientific Treatment is wonderfully
efficacious in the cure of chest and
lung affections, all pulmonary disor
ders-and conditions of wasting-but
that it does cure in cases of well-defined
and unmistakable consumption.
Now, in order to show his deep root
ed belief in the crowning worle of his
life, he offers to send free two bottles
of his newly discovered remedy to any
body suffering from coughs, lung
troubles, consumption, lose of flesh,
and all conditions of wasting.
Nothing could be fairer or more
philanthropic.
The renowned chemist recognizes it
as a moral duty to spread far and wide
the knowledge of his cure for consump
tion.
This generous proposition speaks elo
que ntly indeed of the "good faith" of
the great chemist.
lie wants to send the sunshine and
hope and gladness into families.
Beside victims of consumption, this
ofer interests all who work in bad air,
all who are exposed to cold and damp
ness, all who feel the irritation in the
throat, sore lungs or soreness under
the breast bone, and the steady loss of
strength ani flesh that are the first
signs of sorious lung affection.
Slocum's system is the only one
who.to results have been practically
successful.

A Foolish Proceeding.
Harry Furniss, the London carica
turist, told a story on George Augustus
Sala at a dinner in Scotland to the ef
fect that when Sala was a boy he in
tended to be a painter. At a drawing
test, for admission to an art academy,
Sala handed in the prescribed three
drawings of the human hand, head and
foot, but on the foot were six toes. Sala
sued Furniss for libel on seeing the
story repeated in print. Such is the
English law that, although the dam
ages were mighty small, Furnlss had to
pay the costs, including lawyers' fees
on both sides when a judgment was
brought against him.
