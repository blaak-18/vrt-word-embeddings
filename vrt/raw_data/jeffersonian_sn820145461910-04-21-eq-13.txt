sonian, and like it very much. This
is my first letter, and if I see it in

RIDDLE FROM ARKANSAS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you make
room in your happy band for a little
country boy? I am nine years old,
have two brothers. I will ask some
riddles: Goes up hill down hill, but
yet stands still? To the first one to
answer this riddle, I will send a
post-card. I will close, for I am
afraid of the waste basket. —Your
little friend, Floyd H. Ward, Quit
man, Ark.
FROM iVORTH GEORGIA.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come, a
little North Georgia girl, to join your
happy band. I am five feet and one
inch tall. I have light hair, fair
complexion, and blue eyes. I like to
go to school. I am in the seventh
grade. I live in the country, three
miles and one-half from town. My
father takes both Jeffersonians, and
I enjoy reading the Post-Card Clt b
very much. As this is my first at
tempt, I hope to see it in print. I
will close with a riddle: In and out
through the dead, the living came;
six there were, seven there be. The
one that gives the correct answer to
this will get a pretty post-card. I
will close with much love to Daddy
Jim and Mr. Watson.—Your new
friend, Bersia V. Alexander, R. F. D.

ANSWERS SOME RIDDLES.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and he said he
wished it came every day, instead of
once a week. Granpa thinks Mr.
Watson is the grandest man on the
globe. I am a little boy, thirteen
years old, and go to school in the
country. Am in the fourth grade. I
hope some day to make such a man
as Mr. Watson. Now, if Daddy Jim
won’t put this in the waste basket,
I will try to answer some of the rid
dles: Tom Watson Hearn’s Bible
question is the 119th Psalm; it con
tains 176 verses. The dog’s tail is
like the heart of a tree, because it is
the “center.” The other is a watch.
If I might, 1 would like to have a
post-card from him. The baby and
wheat are alike because they have to
be cradled- If this is right, I will
also look for a card from Velma
Browning. With love and best wish
es to Daddy Jim and the Post-Card
Club, your friend, Teschonna Powell,
Eliza, Ga.
GETS BETTER EVERY WEEK.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little Georgia girl to join your happy
band, and I am five feet one inch tall,
have dark hair, brown eyes and dark
complexion. My papa takes both the
Jeffersonians, and I enjoy reading
them very much. I will close by
asking a riddle: What is it that
goes up stairs and down stairs al
ways on its head? The one that an
swers this gets a pretty post-card.
With much love to Daddy Jim and
cousins, your little friend, Eva Alex
ander, Marietta, Ga., R. F. D. 6.
ANOTHER FROM MISSOURI.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come to
join your happy band again. I have
written to your paper once before,
but I guess it hopped into the waste
basket. My papa takes both the
Jeffersonians, and thinks he could
■ not be without them. I think Mr.
Watson is the smartest man on earth.
I, for one, agree with Mr. Watson on
Foreign Missions- I would love to
in not J»*vvaubuli*speak. lam four
years old and have dark hair.
1 have gray eyes, and am five feet
seven inches tall, and weigh 128
pounds. So you see I am a little
large for my age. I think Mr. Wat
son is very kind to let us have space
in his paper. I think we should
keep the riddles and Bible questions
both going. I will ask some riddles:
(1) Why is a gale of wind like a
young baby? (2) Why is love like
a potato? I will try and answer
some of the riddles. Thomas Grif
fin’s are: (1) The dog’s tail is like
the heart of a tree because it is far
thest from the bark. (2) A watch.
Irene McClellan, the answer to your
riddle No. 2 is a newspaper. Now,
send me our post-card and I will send
you one in return. To. all that an
swer my riddles I will send a pretty
post-card. So, by-by to Daddy Jim
and the Post-Card Club. I remain
your little friend, Gail Boone, Bodo,
Mo.
BUTTED IN.
Dear Daddy Jim: —As it is my
first attempt, I will try to butt in,
some way- I live in the country, two
miles from town. My father takes
The Jeffersonian, and thinks there is
no other paper like it. I have heard
Mr. Watson speak in Dublin, and I
think he is a man who will stand up
for his rights. I will close by asking
some riddles: Round as a biscuit,
busy as a bee, the prettiest little
thing you ever did see. I will send
a card for an answer. Wishing Dad
dy Jim and the Club much success,
Elsie Hamm, Ocilla, Ga., Route 1.
LITTLE KENTUCKY GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you wel
come me in your dear paper for a
few minutes? lam a little girl from
Kentucky, and am eleven years old.
My father, grandfather, and great
grandfather were all doctors. My
uncle is also a doctor. Mj r grand
father takes The Jeffersonian, and I
like to read it very much. I have
seven brothers and no sisters. The
answer to Leila Willoughby’s riddle
is a plum pudding. The answer to
Janie Futral’s is a cow. I will ask a
riddle: What is it that goes with a
coach, comes "with a coach, is of no
use to the coach, and yet it can’t go
without it? A post-card will be sent
to the one that answers this riddle.
If this escapes the waste basket, I
will tvrite again.—Zelma Biggers,
Temple Hill, Ky-
PAPA’S SUNDAY KNIFE.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little Georgia girl to join your happy
band for the first time. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian and thinks it is very
fine. He has a Watson knife, and
calls it his Sunday knife. I like to
read the children’s page. I have
been going to school, but have stop
ped now. My teacher’s name is Miss
Ruth Collins. I like her very much.
I have brown eyes, light hair and fair
complexion. I will close by asking a
riddle: Under water, over water, and
not toching it. I must close, hoping
my letter won’t reach the waste bas
ket. With love and fond wishes to
Daddy Jim and the children, your
little friend, Mary T. Pasley, Crest,
Ga., Route 1.
A SPELLING MATCH.
Hello! Daddy Jim: —I thought I
would try to write a letter to The
Jeffersonian this beautiful morning.
How many of the cousins like music?
1 do, for one. Igo to school at Poca,
Ga., and our teacher is Prof- L. W.
Potts. Our school will be out in
two weeks. lam in the sixth grade.
1 see that the cousins are asking a
lot of riddles, and I think it is all
right. I noticed one of the cousins
said, stop asking riddles and ask
Bible questions. I think we can do
both. Don’t you? My school-mate
is Hoyt Henley. She and I have a
lot of fun when we are together. I
will ask some riddles and questions:
(1) What apostles did Jesus take
with Him privately into the moun
tain? (2) How did our Lord enter
Jerusalem? (3) The letters below
spell six of the States of the United
States: GIOMEANERGIAT
SANEXVEDAAWOAINT
ONIGGAWHS. Whoever an
swers this I will send them a card.
Do not use the same letter twice. —

FISHING IN ARKANSAS.
Hello! Daddy Jim:—How are you
enjoying this fine weather? Have
you been fishing yet? I have not,
but want to go soon. Last spring,
papa and I had a boat made, as we
do lots of fishing. We loaded it on
the wagon one evening, about three
o’clock, with all other fishing neces
sities, and set out for the Little Mis
souri river. We reached our desti
nation in time to put out bait, two
trot-lines and plenty of set hooks be
fore night- This being done, we pre
pared and ate supper. We then sat
down and rested a while. About ten
we went to the trotlines. There were
several small fish on it, which we
took to the house. At midnight we
went to the lines, and to my great
surprise had a catfish nearly as large
as I am. He weighed forty pounds,
and papa certainly had a time get
ting him in the boat. Well, you bet
we were proud of him. We tied him
out on the water with a strong line
and then went to bed. At early
dawn we went to the lines, but there
were no fishes on them, so we took
them up. Then we went up the river
to the set hooks. We had taken all
of them up but one, without any fish.
That one was tied to a snag. It had
a fish nearly as large as the other;
he weighed 36 pounds. We hitched
the horses to the wagon, loaded up
and pulled out to town. We sold and
gave away, together, all but the
thirty-six-pounder. We took him
home, and had all we could eat for
two or three days. I got plenty of fish
one time. We are going again soon-
Daddy Jim, wish you could go with
us. 1 will close by answering a rid
dle: The answer to Lee Ware’s is an
egg. Now I will look for a card. I
will close with love to Daddy Jim
and all the readers. Freeman
Marsh, Okolona, Ark., R. F. D. 1.
