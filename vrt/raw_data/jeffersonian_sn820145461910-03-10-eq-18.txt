Additional Letters From the People
AS TO TARIFF AND SHIPBUILD
ING MATERIALS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I notice in
your weekly what seems to me an
inconsistency. You say on the first
page of the issue of February 17th
“That the Republican tariffs make it
impossible to build vessels in this
country as cheaply as it can be done
abroad.” Then on page 12 (contin
uing the same article) that “Ship
building materials pay no tariff du
ties whatever.”
Now, what I would like to find out
is, why if the materials for building
ships can be brought to this country
free of tariff duties that ships built
here cost about twice as much as
they do abroad? Please answer, if
you have time, in your weekly.
This is the first time I ever found
anything in your writing that I could
not understand and approve.
Very truly yours,
C. M. NOBLE.
Eureka, Kansas.
Answer.
It is always a pleasure to learn
that our readers exercise their own
wits, as they go along.
Apparently, there is an inconsist
ency between the two statements
quoted. I will explain why this,
however, is not so.
(1) The Republican tariff does
exactly what was charged against it,
for it puts up the price of all the
materials which enter into the con
struction of the vessel; increases the
cost of living, and'thus compels the
ship-yards to pay what seems to be
a higher wage than is paid abroad.
In dollars and cents, the American,
at work on a vessel, gets more than
an Englishman so employed. But
the tariff forces the American work
man to pay so much higher prices
for the necessaries and comforts of
life than the Englishman has to give,
that the net result leaves no advan
tage to the American laborer.
It can be demonstrated, with
mathematical certainty, that as a
consumer of artificially boosted
goods, the American worker loses all
that he, as a laborer, gains by Pro
tection, and more too.
But the woeful fact is that you
can’t make him see it.
(2) “Shipbuilding materials pay
no tariff.” I ought to have expressed
it this way: “If shipbuilding mate
rials were imported, they would not
have to pay any duty.” As a matter
of fact, that exemption is a mock
ery, a deliberate deception.
If you will reflect a moment, you
will realize that by the time an
American paid the freight on the
enormous weight of timber, lumber,
steel, boilers, engines, other machin
ery, and other metal that enter into
the construction of one of these
floating palaces, his ship would have
cost him so much more than the for
eigners pay for a similar vessel, that
competition would be out of the
question.
Besides, the dollars which pay the
higher wage of the American work
man would be genuine dollars to
the American who paid the wages,
and would thus widen the difference
in cost of shipbuilding in America
and in Europe.
If Congress would admit to reg
istry and allow the use of the flag to
ships bought where Americans found
them cheapest, our flag would im
mediately fly at the masthead of a
great number of vessels owned by
©be Jeffersonian
Americans. The one firm of J. P.
Morgan & Co. own forty-seven ocean
going vessels, engaged in ocean com
merce. They fly the British flag.

WHO CAN EXPLAIN THIS “SEC
ONDARY EDUCATION”
BUSINESS?
My Dear Sir: —There are some
matters connected with the Univer
sity that ought to be looked carefully
into. As a citizen of Georgia I am
not at all satisfied with what is
known as the “Carnegie Founda
tion”; nor do I like to liave a Profes
sor of Secondary Education as an ex
cressence on the body of Georgia’s
University. I resent the infernal in
terference in the South’s affairs—
educational and otherwise—by Car
negie and his coadjutors in deviltry.
I have supreme contempt for Robert
C. Ogden, who insultingly flaunts his
social equality views and practices
in the faces of the Southern people.
It has come to the pass that we can
not send a boy to the University un
less we kow-tow 7 to the Professor of
Secondary Education, who is a pro
tege and a beneficiary of the “Car
negie Foundation”. I am disgusted
with the whole thing, and am ready
to kick over the traces and denounce
the scheme from “A” to “Z”.
GEORGIA PROFESSOR.
SOME PREACHERS ARE FEAR
ING FOR THEIR JOBS.
Dear Sir: —You have the happy
faculty of so inspiring a man that
when he once reads anything you
write you have him for life. I read
“The Vulture” three times. I loaned
it to a Methodist preacher and he
says it is a classic. But he does not
like what you say on Foreign Mis
sions. You know they could not
hold their jobs if they came over to
your side on that proposition. Don’t
let up on that subject, Mr. Watson.
If you were not telling the truth no
preacher would be mad at you. And
poor little Mr. Ellis! It must give
him nightmare to think how easily
