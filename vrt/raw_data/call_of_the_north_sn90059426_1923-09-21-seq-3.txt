THE WHITE HORSEMAN
OF THE APOCALYPSE
(Following innumerable requests
the following article, which appeared
in the July 6 issue of The Fiery
Cross, is being reprinted.)
With the sixth chapter of the Apoc
alypse, the main action of the book
may be said properly to begin. It is
in this chapter that we first read of
the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.
In Revelations 6:2 we read:
“And I saw, and behold a white
horse, and he that sat theron had a
bow; and there was given unto him a
crown, and he came forth conquering
and to conquer.”
The color of the horse is white,
for throughout these visions that
color is always the symbol of heav
enly purity. The rider has a crown
given him, a crown of royalty. He
has in his hand a bow, the inst.ument
of war, by which he scatters his
enemies like stubble. Finally, he
comes forth conquering and to con
quer, for his victorious march knows
no interruption and at last leaves no
foe unvanquished. In the first rider
we have thus the cause of Christ, in
its essence. By the opening of the
first seal, we learn that this cause
is in the _ world, that this kingdom
is in the midst of us and that they
who opposes it shall be overwhelmed
with defeat.
The interpretation now given of
the first rider, as one who rides forth
to judgment on a sinful world, is
confirmed by what is said of the three
riders that follow him. In them, too,
we have judgment and judgment
only, while the three judgments
spoken of—war, famine and death—
are precisely those with which the
prophets in the Old Testament and
the Saviour, Himself, in the New
Testament have familiarized our
thoughts.
The second horse is red, the color
of blood, for it is the horse of war.
Slaughter and destruction follows it
as its rider passes over the earth.
The third horse is black, the color
of gloom, mourning and lamentation.
The context shows that this horse
man represents the genius of famine.
The figure of the balance and of
measuring bread by weight is on dif
ferent occasions employed in the Old
Testament to express the idea of
famine and scarcity.
The fourth horse is pale. It has
the livid color of a corpse, coi re
sponding to its rider, whose name,
Death, is in this case given. It must
inot be forgotten that the red, black
and pale riders are antagonistic to
and war against the white rider.
The question is asked: Who is the
white horseman ? The answer to this
question can be found in the 19th
chapter of Revelations.
In Revelations 19::11 we read:
“And I saw heaven opened and be
hold a white horse; and he that sat
thereon was called Faithful and
True, and in righteousness he doth
judge and make war.”
Revelations 19:12:
“And his eyes are a flame of fire
and upon his head are many dia
dems; and he hath a name written
which no man knoweth but he, him
self.”
Revelations 19:13:
“And he is arrayed in a garment
dipped in blood and his name is called
The Word of God.”
Revelations 19:14:
“And the armies which are in
heaven followed him upon white
horses, clothed in fine linen, white
and pure.”
Revelations 19:15:
“Ancf out of his mouth propeedeth
a sharp sword, that he should smite
the nations.”
Who, then, is the white horseman ?
The white horseman is the Klansman
of today. How do we know this to
be true? We know this to be true
because in the 19th chapter of Reve
lations he is perfectly described.
First, we read that he is clothed
in white and that he goes forth con-

quering and to conquer. The KUas
man is clothed in white and is in the
fight to win. The white rider is
called: Faithful and True and is said
to fight for righteousness and truth.
This is exactly what the Klansman
is doing in being faithful to the
tenets of the Christian religion and
in defending the flag and the Bible.
The white rider is said to have
eyes of fire and to have a secret name
which no man knoweth but he, him
self. Surely no one can doubt but
that this refers to the Klansman,
whose symbol is fire and whose name
and workings are in secret.
In Revelations 19:13 we read:
“And he is arrayed in a garment
dipped in blood and his name is
called ‘The Word of God.’ ”
The blood in this case refers to the
red which is found on the robe of the
Klansman. The Word of God refers
to the truth for which the white rider
takes his stand.
In Revelations 19:14 there is a
vivid description of the Ku Klux Klan
in action and on the warpath against
sin, ignorance, Romanism, etc. We
read that the armies go forth clothed
in fine linen, white and pure.
The sharp sword which proceeds
out of the mouth of the white rider
is the symbol of war and victory.
The climax of the battle is de
scribed in the Apocalypse, where the
white horseman, typical of the Klan,
fights against the red beast of proph
ecy. The beast is typical of sin,
ignorance, paganism and Romanism.
Phophecy points to the year 1926
as the final and complete overthrow
of Romanism and the devil.
Catholics Fear Klan Unmasking
Antis Amazed at Prominence Of Mem
bers Marching Without Robes.
Scottsdale, Pa.—What perhaps Ro
man Catholic sympathizers in their
hatred toward the Ku Klux Klan fear
more than anything else is the possi
bility of the Klan’s unmasking. The
mask has been the bugaboo used upon
all occasions in attacks, verbal and
otherwise, upon the organization by
Rome followers.
Klansmen of this city last Saturday
night paraded 1,000 strong, dispensing
with the robes and masks. The law
less element were so petrified with
amazement at the disclosure of the
fact that many of the best and lead
ing citizens were in line that they
just naturally forgot to use their
stock of brickbats, clubs, guns, etc.,
carefully gathered together for the
occasion. Today the Romanists are
in mourning. Their last weapon of
offense has been taken, at one fell
blow, out of their hands.
State troops were likewise in evi
dence and made it plain to the lurk
ing mob that un-American tactics,
such as were put in force at Carnegie
the preceding week would not be
tolerated. With the unmasking of
the Klan Scottdale Romanists are dis
consolately searching for a new ral
lying cry with which to oppose the
friends of the public schools and
Protestantism.
Over a hundred thousand divorces
were granted in the United States
last year, while there were a million
marriages. During the twenty years,
1900 to 1920, 1,883,591 divorces were
allowed in America, in which 5,085,-
696 men, women and children were in
volved.
One reason why so many marriages
turn out failures in the United States
is that it is so easy for young peo
ple to get married. For instance, in
some states, the age limit under
which it is illegal for boys and girls
to get married, is only twelve for
girls and fifteen for boys. In seven
teen states there is no minority age
at all.

THE CALL OF THE NORTH
The idea that the word Socialism,
as used to describe a theory, has no
fixed or well-defined meaning has led
to confusion and misunderstanding.
As a matter of fact, Socialism has
been clearly defined by a number of
able writers on both sides of the
question, who agree in general as to
the fundamental ideas involved in
this word.
Socialism is the collective, or pub
lic, ownership and management of
the means of production and distri
bution of wealth for the benefit of
all the people.
How Does the Social Party Itself Do*
fine Socialism?
“Socialism is the establishment of
a System of Society based on the
common ownership and democratic
control of the means and instruments
for producing and distributing
wealth, by and in the interests of the
whole community.”
In both definitions are found the
three essential ideas of Socialism:
1. Public ownership of the means of
producing wealth; 2. Public control;
and 3, for the benefit of the whole
community.
What Are the Chief Means of Pro
duction and Distribution Which
the Socialists Claim Should Be
Owned by the Public?
The land, the coal, the mines, the
water power, the factories, the banks,
the railways, the waterways, all
kinds of machinery and various other
forms of property.
It is obvious then that the private
receipt of rent and interest ceases
when public ownership of land and
capital takes the place of individual
ownership.
What Is the Distinction Between the
Socialist and the Mere Social Re
former?
The distinction lies in the methods
suggested for accomplishing -the re
sult. Both aim to better the condi
tion of the poor, but the Socialist
claims that the object can be at
tained only through public owner
ship and control of the means of pro
duction and distribution, while the
Social Reformer denies that the
principles of Socialism are feasible,
believing that the scheme, if at
tempted, would be a costly experi
ment to any nation, and that better
means can be found to improve the
condition of the poor.
Is a Person Then Justified in Calling
Himself a Socialist Because He Is
Dissatisfied With Present Social
and Industrial Conditions and In
sists that Labor Shall Have a
Larger Share of Profits Resulting
From the Production of Wealth?
No. No person is really a So
cialist who does not believe in the
public ownership and control of the
means of production and distribution
of wealth.
Is There a General Agreement
Among the Socialists All Over the
World Upon the Fundamental
Principles of Socialism As Ex
pressed in the Above Definitions?
Socialists of all countries are in
agreement upon these fundamental
principles, but they differ among
themselves as to the methods which
should be employed in putting these
principles into practice, or bringing
about public ownership of private
property. Socialists themselves are
divided into two general classes
which may be called the Evolutionary
Class and the Revolutionary Class.
What Is the Distinction Between
These Two?
The Evolutionists, who consistent
ly adhere to our democratic form of
government, believe in a peaceful
and gradual change of the laws and
economic conditions so that the prin
ciples of Socialism may be brought
into operation without financial up
heavel or bloody revolution. These
Socialists, as a rule, believe also that
the government or public should com
pensate the private owners when
property is taken over by the public.
The Revolutionists, on the other
hand, are opposed to the slow, peace
ful method of reaching the desired
end, and advocate what they consider
a more speedy method. They preach
the violation of law, the use of phys
ical violence, and an immediate rev
olution by civil war and bloodshed.
These radical Socialists openly ad
vocate the confiscation of private
property without compensation to
private owners.
What Is the Attitude of These Rev
olutionists or Radical Socialists
Toward Our Government?
Their attitude is that of opposi
tion and defiance, as is shown by
their declaration that, “National pa
triotism is a false doctrine,” which
should be supplanted by what they
call Internationalism. Their opposi
tion is further shown by the fact
that, while the Socialists of England,
France, Maly, Russia and Germany
supported their respective govern
ments after war was declared, the
Socialists assembled at the St. Louis
convention in April 7-14, 1917, avow
ed their opposition to the war, and
called upon the Socialist workers to
refuse support to the United States
government.
Was This Vote of Disloyalty Unaoi
mous?
No, it was not. Mr. Spargo with
a few other prominent Socialists
hacked by a small minority voted
against this resolution.
Mention Five Ways in Which Revolu
tionary Socialists Sought to Pre-
SOCIALISM
CATECHETICALLY DEFINED
vent the United States from Tak-
An Effective Part in the War?
1. Exoneration of Germany. 2.
Opposition to conscription. 3. De
mand for the repeal of the Monroe
Doctrine. 4. Urging the repudiation
of the war debt (Liberty Bonds), and
5, encouragement of general strikes
to paralyze all war industries.
Do the Radical Socialists Desire the
Utter Destruction of Our Demo-
ers tic Form of Government?
In their convention held in Chicago
in 1918 they declared: “The present
structure of our government is total
ly inadequate.” They then demand
ed ‘the abolition of the Senate: the
election of federal judges by the peo
ple, and making them subject to re
call; and the abolition of the power
of the courts to declare acts of Con
gress unconstitutional.” These and
a number of other demands made by
them would, if granted, radically
change our representative form of
government and destroy the checks
and balances so carefully devised by
the wise founders of our national
government.
In What Other Activities Are the
Radical Socialists Engaged to
Further Their Revolutionary De-
signs?
The Radical or Revolutionary So
cialists, known among themselves as
the “Left Wing,” are lending their
services to Lenine and Trotsky in
their propaganda for the spread of
Bolshevism in the United States.
What Is Bolshevism?
Bolshevism is the kind of govern
ment now being administered in Rus
sia under the guidance of Lenine and
Trotsky.
“The term Bolshevist was first
used in 1903 at a convention of the
Russian Social Democratic Party
when upon a test vote, the party di
vided between the majority and the
minority. The majority party was
nicknamed the ‘Bolsheviki,’ and the
minority the ‘Mensheviki,’ the terms
being derived from the Russian
words ‘Bolshinstvo' and ‘Menshinstvo,’
meaning respectively majority i and
minority.”—(N. Y. Tribune Maga
zine, Dec. 1, 1918.) **
Bolsheviki thus defined means a
majority of a Socialist party, not a
majority of the Russian people.
What Is the Nature of the Govertv
ment Provided in the Russian So
viet Constitution?
By referring to the Russian Con
stitution itself, as adopted by the
Bolsheviki, July 10, 1918, and com
paring it with our own form of gov
ernment, the American citizen may
better understand the real nature of
Bolshevism.
In Chapter one, Section one of the
Russian Constitution Russia is de
clared to be a Republic of the Soviets
of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Pleasants’
Deputies. “All the central and local
power belongs to these soviets.”
To lodge all power in these soviets
is in marked contrast with our con
stitution, which does not recognize
absolute power in any body of men.
The fundamental aim of our govern
ment is the protection of the indi
vidual from absolute and unlimited
control. Governments according to
American ideas are created for the
purpose of securing to the individual
the right to life, liberty, and the pur
suit of happiness. The courts exist
to prevent the government from de
priving the individual of his funda
mental rights.
Is the Russian Soviet Government,
According to Section One, in Any
Sense a Democracy?
A Democracy as the term is under
stood in this country is a govern
ment of the people by the people and
for the people, but according to Sec
tion one of the Russian Constitution
of July 10, 1918, the Soviet govern
ment is designed for only three
classes of people, namely, the Work
ers, the Soldiers and the Peasants.
The word workers as used here, and
elsewhere in the Constitution must
be construed to mean only those who
work with their hands.
Section 65 of their Constitution dis
tinctly mentions seven classes of peo
ple who have no voice in the making
of the laws which govern them, and
expressly debars such persons from
voting or holding office. Some of
these classes are as follows: (a)
Persons who employ hired labor
* * * for “increase in profits”;
(b) “Persons who have an inome
* * * such as interest from capi
tal, receipts from property, etc.” (c)
“Private merchants, trade and com
mercial brokers.” (d) “Monks and
clergy of all denominations.” Not
being a government of the people,
but of a class, it is evident that the
“Soviet Republic” is not a democracy.
What Disposition is Made of Private
Property in the Russian Const iu
tion?
Section 3 (a) of the Russian Con
stitution declares: “All private
property in land is abolished, and
thie entire land is declared to be
abolished, and the entire land is de
clared to be national property.” It
is frankly declared to be taken by
this all-powerful government “with
out any compensation to the former
owners.” The American Constitution
declares that no person shall “be de
prived of life, liberty or property,
without due process of law.” This
guarantees you against being plun
dered by your government, as its
officials can not take your property
except in accordance with a law made
by your own representative.
What Is Said in the Russian Con-
stitution About Religion?
The Russian Constitution declares,
in Section 13, “the right of religious
and anti-religious propaganda is ac
corded to every citizen. It is ac
corded to him, however, by a govern
ment which is all-powerful. “Ac
corded” merely means that the gov
ernment gives it to you for the mo
ment. The power that accorded it
can also take it away whenever it
pleases, for it has all power. The
American Constitution, on the other
hand, says: “Congress shall make no
law respecting the establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free ex
ercise thereof.” So long as that
clause stands in our Constitution,
your religious freedom is perfectly
safe. Congress may vote unanimous
ly a dozen times to take away your
right to your own religion, but the
Supreme Court will point to that
clause and say, “The Resolutions are
of no force; they are not law.”
Does Section 14 of the Russian Con
stitution Provide for Freedom of
Speech?
Section 14 of the Russian Con
stitution declares that “for the pur
pose of securing freedom of expres
sion to the toiling masses, the Rus
sian Socialist Federated Soviet Re
public abolishes all dependence of the
press upon capital,” but this is no
guarantee of a free press, for the
Russian Government is supreme and
may change this condition at any
time.
The American guarantee consists
in a declaration that “Congress shall
make no law abridging the freedom
of speech or of the press.” This
puts the whole matter quite outside
of the powers of the, government.
But this right of free speech and
free press justifies no one in sedi
tious agitation or treasonable ut
terance. Against these the govern
ment has power to act, according to
the law of self-defense.
What Should Be the Attitude of All
Patriotic Citizens Toward Bolshev
ism or Revolutionary Socialism?
The intelligent and patriotic citi
zen should set himself to work at
once, to arouse his fellow-patriots to
the menace of Bolshevism. He
should realize that the Bolsheviki are
doing their utmost to overthrow our
government; that they boldly pro
claim their purpose and are to-day
spreading their propaganda all over
the United States; that they are com
bining their forces with those of the
I. W. W., the Anarchists, or any oth
er organization which favors confis
cation of private property.
A clear distinction should be made,
however, between the two classes of
Socialists, for the revolutionary and
peaceful Socialist is still patriotic; he
still believes in a government of law
and order, and in the protection of
his right to life, liberty and property.
He may be counted on to co-operate
with other loyal citizens in the fight
to save this nation from anarchy,
murder, robbery and a bloody civil
war, which would threaten the de
struction of our present civilization.
“It is a calmity, not alone for Rus
sia, but for the world at large, to
permit Bolshevism to flourish and ex
pand.”—Mme. Breshkovskaya, N. Y.
Times, Jan. 29, 1919.
What Is the Opinion of Americans
Who Have Seen Bolshevism at
Work in Russia?
“The Bolshevist Government main
tains itself absolutely by terror.
They got into power by promising
the people peace, bread and land.
They kept in power by owning ma
chine guns and /using Ijhem.”—Dr.
Wm. Chapin Huntington, Former
Commercial Attache, American Em
bassy in Petrograd.
‘I am sure if Bolshevism is ever
put before our people that it will be
emphatically rejected. Yes, there is
a kinship between the I. W. W. and
Bolshevism. • * * I regard the
soviet program as economically im
possible and morally wrong.”—Col.
Raymond Robins, Head American
Red Cross Mission to Russia, testi
fying before U. S. Senate Committee
in March.
New York Times, March 7, 1919.
“A reign of terror instituted by
the Bolsheviki, with the purpose of
maintaining themselves in power, is
prevailing in central and. northern
Russia. The outrages they have com
mitted are incredible.—David R.
Francis, Ambassador to Russia.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Question: Is the Bible read in the
public schools all over the United
States?
Answer: Six states require a por
tion of the Bible to be read daily in
their schools; six other states speci
fically permit it by law; in 19 states
and the District of Columbia the law
is silent on the subject and under
general terms of the law, Bible read
ing is construed as permissible; in
five states whose laws otherwise con
tain no specific provision on the sub
ject, the courts have rendered opin
ions favorable to Bible reading. In
Michigan .and California the matter is
at present somewhat in doubt. In 10
states, is not permissible to read the
Bible at stated times in the public
schools. Three of this 10 have ad
verse court decisions on such read
ing.

ILLINOIS KLAN BUYS DAILY
NEWWSPAPER.
The first daily newspaper to be
purchased by any Klan in the coun
try is the Pekin Daily Times of Pe
kin, 111. This newspaper has been
bought by Pekin Klan Number 31,
which will assume control of the pub
lication September 15 next with the
purpose of issuing a wide-awake pa
triotic and up-to-date newspaper.
The Pekin Daily Times is one of
the best known publications in this
section of the country. It was es
tablished 42 years ago, and has a
large circulation which under the new
management will be rapidly in
creased. Pekin is a progressive lit
tle city of about 14,000 population.
The newspaper will be circulated in
all sections of Tazewell county. It
was acquired by a stock company
of Klansmen.
Pekin Klan is one of the most ac
tive Klan organizations in the mid
dle west. They own their own Klav
ern which is regarded as a model of
its kind,’ and its membership is
growing rapidly. On August 15 this
Klan naturalized 500 aliens at South
Pekin, and shortly before this date
staged a ceremonial at Morton, 111.
The influence of this Klan has placed
loyal patriotic American citizens in
public office in their city and their
county.
What America needs is to follow
the footsteps of our fathers instead
of the footsteps of the dancing mas
ter.

POINTS OUT PERIL TO WHITE
SUPREMACY.
Dr. William Guthrie, department
of economics of the College of New
York, in speaking at the convention
of the Wisconsin Bankers’ associa
tion in Milwaukee, said:
“Unless immigration of other than
whites is halted entirely, two gen
erations wll see the whites of the
United States wiped out. Colored
races rear families much faster than
white families, and we must protect
the while race in this country.”
With the Japs slowly but surely
gaining control on the Pacific coast,
and with ten million negroes in
America, the above words bear spe
cial significance. A New York negro
paper a few months ago called on all
negroes to fight politically, and if
need be physically. It is high time
that white men are organizing.

WORLD’S NEED IS PEACE.
What more poignant need in the
world of today, tomorrow—and per
haps many tomorrows —than peace?
The wealth now wasted on one bat
tleship, doomed for the junk heap
after a few years afloat, would build
many hospitals. Only one year’s ap
propriations for coast defenses,
standing armies, pension bills and
such throughout the world would
bring many school houses many uni
versities, into' being. The way has
been pointed by Edward W. Bok, who
offers SIOO,OOO for the best plan by
which the United States may co-oper
ate with other nations to eradicate
war.
This cause overlaps all the rest.
Pestilence and poverty have stalked
the world for ages. Why have they
never been conquered ? Why so
many centuries when what there was
of learning was confined to the few
and only now some general effort be
ing made to make knowledge avail
able for many? The answer is:
War.
Preparation for war.
Waging of war.
Paying the debts of war.
Nations cannot, will not, dare not
co-operate against the common foes
of humanity—disease and poverty
and ignorance—while they stagger
under the cost of going armed
against each other. The healing,
creative impulses of humanity can
not be fully unshackled while the ap
palling cost of the suspicion and hat
red of which armaments are the sym
bol must be met.—Detroit News.

MORE ROMAN BLUFF
An Oklahoma priest sued a Prot

to bluff the minister but failed, the
latter demanding the suit go to trial.
Well, the priest came out second best,
