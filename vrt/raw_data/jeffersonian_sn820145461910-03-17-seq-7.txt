in order to cause outbreaks profitable
to vaccine manufacturers is a tempta
tion too strong for the commercial
spirit of the present age to resist.
The methods employed to bring
about compulsory vaccination when
outbreaks of smallpox occur are well
known to us, as we have inside in
formation in regard to them from
employees of men in the business.
An illustration was recently furnish
ed to the public in Chicago where it
was brought out that a prominent
health officer received a private sal
ary from a leading vaccine manufac
turer.

MORE VIEWS ON COMPULSORY
VACCINATION.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —I have just
read with much interest, The Jeffer
sonian of March 3d, your article en
titled “Is Compulsory Vaccination
Lawful,” and take great pleasure in
saying that I consider it to be both
logical and forceful, and worthy of
profound consideration, and I believe
will bear great fruits and accomplish
great results. I think that too much
latitude is taken by many of our
leading municipalities in the enforce
ment of city ordinances, which I firm
ly believe are both illegal and unau
thorized, and I believe that the peo
ple will rebel against such unlawful
practices. I was employed a few
days ago by a hard-working laborer,
who by trade is a barber, and in or
der that you may understand the
treatment he received at the hands
of one of the city of Atlanta’s health
officers enclose you a clipping from
the Atlanta Constitution of March 3d,
showing to what extremes the officers
are allowed to go. I hope that you
will continue through your great pa
per, condemn such unlawful prac
tices, as I believe the masses heartily
endorse the sentiments you have so
ably expressed.
With kindest regards and best
wishes, I beg to remain
Yours very truly,
HOWELL C. ERWIN.

A LETTER WHICH WILL BE OF
INTEREST TO TEXANS.
Mr. J. W. Moore, Route 1, Carbon,
Texas.
My Dear Sir: —Yours received.
.You will find Neill out if you will
just keep your eyes open and your
'mind willing to be convinced. If he
will deny what that old friend of his
said in The Jeffersonian about his
selling out in the old Populist days
for SSO in the election which was re
ferred to, I will get up affidavits and
publish them. If he dares to put
into his paper, or any other, a writ
ten statement contradicting what I
have said about the way that he
scooped the Co-operator, ruining
Pyle and those other two gentlemen,
I will get the affidavits on that.
Was it honest for him to place the
name of Charley Barrett among those
who were contributing to pay for that
Washington trip? Charley simply
handed him a dollar as the subscrip
tion price to his paper. Yet Mr. Neill
placed Mr. Barrett’s name on the list
of those who contributed to his
Washington trip, knowing that Bar
rett’s name would influence many a
loyal Union man to follow what seem
ed to be Barrett’s example.
Again, would you yourself accept a
position under an lowa Republican,
who is gobbling up Farmers’ Union
papers for the purpose of gradually
advocating such Republican measures
as the Hannacrat ship subsidy steal?
Just watch developments, and keep
your mind open to conviction, and
you will become convinced that I
have I have made no mistake as to
the character of D. J. Neill. I have
no axe to grind; had nothing per
sonal against him, and was simply
exposing him because I realized
what an enormous danger that Rei
mers merger of Farmers’ Union
newspapers is to the future of your
organization and our great cotton
growing section.
You may use this letter in what
ever way you see fit.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.
P. S. —I am sending you a letter
which ought to convince you as to
the character of Reimers and Neill.
It has already convinced other men
who, like yourself, were disposed to
believe that Neill was being slander

HUNGRY CHILDREN.
Following is an extract from the
Associated Press report of House
proceedings:
“Five thousand children who at
tend the public schools in Chicago
are habitually hungry and 10,000
others in that city are not sufficiently
nourished, according to a letter from
the superintendent of the schools of
Chicago from which Representative
Henry, of Texas, read excerpts in the
House today.
“ ‘Texas,’ declared Mr. Henry, re
plying to a recent speech in defense
of the new tariff law, delivered by
Representative Boutell, of Illinois,
‘is prosperous in spite of the Payne-
Aldrich bill. If that law had any
thing to do with the prosperity of
Texas why does it not bring pros
perity to Chicago and other great
cities of this'country.’ ”
There “lies before me as I write”
a copy of a dago’s ad which says:
“Peanuts five a bag.” Perhaps if
we had only a “few thousand of the
many thousand dollars sent over
across the sea to furnish summer
homes for our beloved, though be
nighted, missionaries, the growing
appetites of these ragged little Chica
goans could be appeased, provided
the money be appropriated to corner
the peanut market for the benefit of
these children.
Singularly enough, such shocking
stories as told in the clipping above
are found only in the news columns
of the daily press, the ’steamed Con
gressional Record and such papers as
The Jeffersonian, but seldom in our
so-called religious papers! Wonder
why?

RHODE ISLAND READY FOR
POLITICAL CHANGE.
My Dear Sir: —Your circulars
with Petition of U. S. Money League
printed upon one side with a well
written and true analysis of the
function of money printed upon the
other is received, and rest assured
I shall see they find circulation
among many in the State of Rhode
Island, a State which has sent to
Congress for several years through
the power of a political machine the.
Hon. Nelson W. Aldrich. The blood
which once pulsated in the veins of
the sturdy and honest old New Eng
land stock is fast fading away be
neath the power of the many. Shy
locks who demand a pound of flesh
for a dollar in gold. Political cor
ruption enters every nook and cor
ner, while graft is seen in most every
official direction. With many the
highest ambition seen is to be an
obedient tool for some ring con
trolled by money. The independence
of many finds more satisfaction by a
3effersonlan
cheap sale of their freemanship at
the ballot box than in standing true
to tradition of country. Combina
tions have driven from the market
the many middlemen of a few years
ago, and centralization with its
many virulent poisons injected in our
once free republic would now inject
the most deadly of all the centraliza
tion of money which will prove the
final death of American liberty.
Good qualities never die, or either
good men.
Is Jackson dead, or Washington
Who lived for country’s fame?
Or Jefferson, or honest Abe,
Ben Franklin or mad Wayne?
These honest men they sleep beneath
The turf on which we tread;
Their lips are silent in the grave
But still they are not dead.
Old honest Hickory’s flesh is dust,
Perhaps his bones are rotten;
But his name will live in years to
come
When Aldrich is forgotten.
Respectfully yours,
WILSON S. MOWRY.

LAWRENCE BIRD RECEIVING AT
TENTION AND MONEY.
Dear Sir: —Your letter of the 28th
ult. to Mr. T. S. Shope of this city
has been handed me along with your
check for the sum of $4.55, made pay
able to the order of Lawrence Bird.
I have undertaken to aid Lawrence
with his business and correspondence,
both being far beyond his ability, as
he is a helpless paralytic, and has
been for twenty-eight years. I, am
making no apologies for the invalid’s
past conduct, but we have scriptural
warrant for forgiving more than one
offense.
I am sorry that I can not inform
you of the disposition of previous
contributions sent Lawrence Bird,
but my work dates back only ten
days. As I write this letter my wife
is busy answering letters, some 200
or more in number, that have accu
mulated on Lawrence’s hands, he be
ing unable to do sustained letter
writing at any time.
The check which you so kindly for
warded to the invalid was cashed to
day and the proceeds placed to Law
rence Bird’s credit. Allow me for
him to extend heartfelt thanks to his
sympathetic friends for their timely
assistance.
Yours sincerely,
T. S. LUCAS,
Supt. Public Schools.

JIM HOGAN OR MAJOR McGREGOR

Mr. Watson: —How about getting
out some good old Pop for Congress
in this district? For instance, your
self or J. M. Hogan or C. E. McGre

Pops who prefer voting for such men.
Let them run in the Democratic pri
mary. Let me hear from you on
the matter.
