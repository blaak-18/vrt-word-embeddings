We it) nolt know whether it is
true or fake, but it is rumiliiored
that tihe railroad eiillloyee.s resi
ding in thit llarish have receivelt
notice from hltdqhuartileri to sup
port for noiiinatiton those cindli
dates who will vote for Seniatior
Illanchard for the United Stl ates
Senate. There may Ie solllet.lin'i
in tiis report. O)ur reaiders will
reileiilhber that i special coach was
sent over the Texas & Pacitic iRail
roiad from Boyce to try aind cartry
the Leni box for :1 delegation that
wouldl favor, in the Parish Con
vention on Dece. 7th, a resolution
instructing the parish Rlepreseenta
tives ito support Senator Blanchard.
A guentlenian called the edhitor',sI
attention to what lie considerled the i
reason whyv tlhe railroad corlnpra
tions are trying to assist Mr. Mlan
chard. lie thought it was on tac
count of that old publ ic lani miiat
ter, when the New Orleans Pacille
Railroad ('Comiipany wais given near
ly every other section of land in
this andl surrounding plari.hes.
le remiindedI us that Senator Wlhan
chard was in Congress when that
deal wai s made. Nearly all of our 1
readers renmenmiler the Blahinchard
Robertsm aizreelient. The ('Com
gpany receivedl titles to thousands
upon thousands of acres of land,
and had no more right to the gift
than any citizen of the United
States. Many pooir hleoplle have
lost their honmes and the Railroad
Company gathered them in, a free
gift from the (lovernment by Con
gress.
If it be true that the railroad
comupanies are to assist Senator
Blanchard's candidacy, we do not
believe it is on account of that old
Texas & Pacific land matter. That
happened many years ago, and the
officials of the present railroad
companies were in no way inter
esteod in that transaction.-Town
Talk.
The doctrine of the Initiative and
Referendum is new or not under
stood by but few, except those who
have been members of the Popu
list party, we will explain it brief
ly.
It means simply, that the people
shall have the right to initiate any
law which a specified nutmber shall
petition for. For example sup
pose a majority of the people of
the United States should petition
Congress that it pass a coinage bill
for silver and gold at the ratio of
16i to 1, and Congress should refuse
to pass the nll, the Referendtum
of the law would make it the duty
of Comgress to submit that ques
tion to the people to vote upon,
and if a majority should vote for
it, then it would be a law, in spite
of Congress or President to the
contrary.
It means the people shall have a
power to initiate a law, and by re
ferendum may confirm their act by
vote, and make it a law.
It means that the people may
rule.

l Iehre this issue reaches our
readers the so-edaled Democratic
party of this State will have met
at Shreveport and reInomin:ate(
Murphy J. Foster for Governor.
Many D)emocrats have frequently
remarked that he is the most un
p)pular mIan to-day in tile State,
and owes his present suecess solely
to the "imachinery" of the party
which he and Grover hold in this
State by the power if patronage.
The situation with the Demo
cratic party in this State is but a
repetition of its history in Ohio,
Marvland and Kentucky-an iron
clad rule of a few bosses.
May it Ineet with tile same fate
at the hali.s of the Populists that
it me there at other hands.
If Cleveland had been as great
a success in managing the finances
of the nation as he has in mana
ging his own, the country would
he quite prosperous. But while
making a fortune for himself he
has bankrupted pretty much every
Ildy else. Perhaps the two things
are eounterlarts of each other and
if the first hadn't taken place the
las wt ould not have occurred.
Nonconformist.
The Force Bill-A Prophee)'.
Look out for the old Force bill.
The South is going over to the
People's party. The "silver craze"
rages there. 4nnething has to he
kthe by the onip parties to stop
this movement.
Therefore the Republican party,
I at the instance of the Democratic
party party, will introduce in all
probability, into the next Congres
a blood and thunder force bill.
Thqn Hoke Smith and other
Democratic orators of the South
can get out their fog horns and cry
"Force bill and nigger domina
tion."
Silver will then again be lost
sight of. The South will stick to
the old piarty and Wall street will
be saved. Plutocracy will be tri
umphant. The money power will
go eon quietly to put manacles on
the arms of her willng slaves.
The man who is fooled again by the
force bill cry deserves to be driven
every morning to his task by the
lash of his master.
Bonds and bayonets are more to
be dreaded than any force bill that
can be devised, and now you have
both.-The Man, W. Va.
Job work must be paid for when
delivered. There is no exception
to this rule. Strictly cash.
