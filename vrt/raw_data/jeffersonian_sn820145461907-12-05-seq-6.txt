FARM NOTES.
An early crop of peas puts soil in
fine condition for late potatoes.
Locality has much to do with the
success of any crop.
Planting seed is the beginning of
raising a crop, not the end.
Thorough tillage loosens the soil,
admits air and destroys weeds and
grass—three very important things.
Grindstones should not stand in the
sun, nor in a trough partly filled with
water.
The county may do much on the
road, but there is always work left
for the private individual.
However large the corn crop, a pas
ture is indispensable to every farm
that has stock.
Late seasons do not argue that there
will be no harvest. Nature takes
care of herself.
Work done at the best time and
in the best way is worth twice as
much as work done at other times
and in a poor way.
Probably the best method of keep
ing sweet potatoes is in dry sand.
Put into barrels a layer of sand and
a layer of potatoes. They will not
sprout until they become damp.
The advantage or disadvantage of
planting at a certain time of the moon
is largely a thing of the past. Intel
ligent farmers plant when the season
is right, moon or no moon.
A man has only so much real
knowledge as he can command in
times of emergency. The knowledge
we have which will not come when
needed, is only an aggravation, like a
horse which can not be caught when
wanted.
The best results occur when fields
are given the same culture as a gar
den, with the use of plenty of ma
nure, keeping down the weeds and
grass and making every foot do its
utmost in producing whatever is
planted in it.
Texas Fruits, Nuts, Berries and
Flowers is the attractive name of a
new journal being published at San
Antonio. J. W. Canada is editor and
proprietor. Judging from its con
tents, it will have its work and will
soon find a place among many who
are up-to-date horticulturists.
A new comer need not expect to
go to a new country and sit around
and whittle, nor ride into town and
spend the day at the store, and make
a living like some of the old settlers
do. He will have to hustle like they
did when they were new comers. The
sitting around comes at the end, not
at the beginning, of a residence in a
place.—Texas Farmer.
SHALL WE SURRENDER?
Never! The farmer will never sur
render. It is not just, and nothing
demands it except greed and specu
lation. Our cotton is worth 15 cents ;
demand for cotton goods justifies that
i price, and the cotton goods based on
15-cent cotton. Brother Fanners, the
eotton exchange and the Cotton Buy
ers’ Union have combined with the
banks to burst the Union. Some of
them have said to plainly, and every
thing goes to prove it, because our
WATSON’S WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
State treasurer says that our State
banks never were in better condition.
The land is prosperous, except the
cotton business (that is, the produc
tion of cotton). The government is
standing behind the banks with mil
lions pouring in from Europe, and in
spite of this our merchants pretend
to be very sorry for the farmer. All
this is, of course, all “bosh,” and a
scheme to deceive and beat us out of
what justly belongs to us. We have
the right to fix the price on our
products, as well as the merchant has
to put a price on his goods, and 50
to 100 per cent profit doesn’t seem
to be too much for him to ask on his
investment.
Two of my neighbor merchants say
that 10 cents is enough for cotton.
Still each of these men left the plow
and took up the yardstick. The
plan of this class of men is to keep
the farmer poor and embarrassed.
Farmers, do not submit to such a
system as is being forced on you.
Hold your cotton until this time next
year. You have bread, meat, pota
toes, peas, milk and butter and hay to
make more. Put your cotton under
shed and don’t let your condition
scare you into selling. If the worst
comes to the worst, fight for your
rights, for a man never did a better
thing than to fight for home and the
little ones. Brothers, this is a fight
to the end. Let us get all the non
union men we possibly can to stand
with us, for the prosperity of the
Southern farmer, as well as all legiti
mate business, depends upon the price
of cotton. Brothers, 10 cents per
pound for your cotton will leave you
in debt, the other fellow with a big
bank account. It will leave your
children in the cotton field as ever,
and the other fellow’s children in
college. It will leave you with a
heavy mortgage outstanding and the
other fellow with a large bank ac
count and a mortgage to collect. It
will leave you in rags, the other fel
low in fine clothes. You know these
are facts, so stick together, show your
grit and backbone, stand to your
guns, and we will win the fight. If
the other fellow can burst the Union,
he thinks it will never be able to ral
ly again. When the cotton factors
see that they can no longer depend
on Wall street and the cotton gamb
lers for their supply, they will hunt
us up and pay our price. Again I
say do not surrender. You owe a
duty to your country, to your fellow
men, to your wife, to the little rag
ged children that stood by you these
long summer days and helped you to
work and make the crop so that they
might have a few pennies for Christ
mas. You can not afford to sacrifice
your rights and your liberties, the
labor of your little ones and all you
ever expect to have on the altar of
greed and corruption.

A man buying cotton on a salary
for a firm of cotton speculators, said
to a prominent farmer in a North
Texas county a few days ago: “Yon
farmers are right for holding on to
your cotton. The cotton speculators
are making the prices in their own
interests, and all these reports and
stories you read calculated to induce
you to rush your cotton to market are
manufactured falsehoods sent out bv
these speculators to stampede the
farmers. Hold on to your cotton and
you’ll get your price, and then, in
another year, we will be independent
of Wall street and its gamblers. I
am offering to buy cotton, but I am
glad I am getting but very little.
Just hold on and you are safe.” —

THE KEY IS 15 CENTS.
Editor Farmers’ News Scimitar:
Dear Editor. Here I am again, ask
ing you for space in your valuable
paper. Wake up, farmers, and come
to the front. If we ever need to
stand together as a class, farmers,
now is the time. Don’t let this gold
en opportunity pass; let us all be
up and ready to do our part, trust
ing in the Supreme Power to help us
to stand firm for our Union and its
cause. Brothers, stick to the minimum
price of 15-cent cotton, and don’t
sell it for less. It will not be long
until we will get our price. The
gamblers are the ones that get the
profits now. Why can’t the “old
hayseeds,” as they call us farmers,
keep that profit for themselves? The
day will come when the farmer prices
his own stuff, and does not have to go
all over town to see who will bid him
the best price. If you are in distress,
borrow money on your cotton; set
tle your accounts. The increased
price you get for the cotton will more
than pay the interest on the mone>
you borrow. Do not mortgage your
farm, for a mortgage makes you a
slave. A man giving a mortgage sells
hi§ rights. There are many things we
can do without if we have to. Buy
only what you need, and don’t go
into debt. We all must use mor?
economy; we must be very saving; wo
need education in economizing, espe
cially the Southern eotton growers.
Cotton speculators are doing every
thing in their power to keep the price
of cotton down, and I appeal to my
brother farmers to stand by the Uii
ien. The spinner* have to have the
cotton, and their spindles will not be
idle because they have to pay the
minimum price of 15 cents, especially
as the crop is short.
We must remember that all organi
zations accomplish a purpose through
co-operation, and if our 2,000,000
members stick together in this great
fight we are bound to win a victory.
Our little band up here is doing fine.
We have two warehouses, one at Pon
totoc, Miss., and one at Verona, Miss.
The key to these warehouses is 15-
cents per pound.

News Scimitar and brother farmers,

SCIENCE AND FARMING.
One of the many important facts in
modern farm science most worthy the
attention of farmers who think, is
the new system of feeding live stock.
Present ideas which have grown from
and out of old-time methods within
comparatively recent years, put the
whole feeding question on a truly
scientific basis. The proportion anJ
composition of foods is fully explain
ed by agricultural science and wis n
breeders and feeders pay sufficient
attention to the subject to reap great
benefit from it.
Facts upon which the entire struc
ture of the cattle feeding business
rests are so well attested that there
is no gainsaying them, and first and
foremost in actual importance is the
tonic idea.
It teaches one common sense prin
ciple—no animal under the continued
strain of heavy feeding can make sat
isfactory growth or production un
less the digestive apparatus is
strengthened to meet such strain.
To attempt to bring a fine bunch of
thrifty steers up to the proper sell
ing weight, or to get a large average
production of milk from a herd of
cows, leaving nature to settle alone
the constant over drafts made on ani
mal digestion by big, daily rations
of rich foods, is simply to upset the
very end in view.
If fatting cattle and cows in milk
were always at liberty to select what
instinct tells them is best or neces
sary, there would of course be no
need of the tonic. But here is where
the difficulty arises. Cattle can not
choose or select for themselves, but
must eat what the feeder furnishes,
and besides endure a stuffing process
for weeks and months. Is it any won
der that their overtaxed and unassist
ed organism breaks under the strain?
Give your cattle a tonic —something
to strengthen digestion—and growth
will be continuous because then there
can be no interruption caused by in
digestion, loss of appetite, or compli
cations of a more serious nature.
Another great advantage in the
tonic idea is its economy. Cattle re
ceiving it, because of greater appe
tite, eat more rough fodder and thus
reduce feed bill*.
Betide*, it is a well attested fact
that there is great saving of nutri
ment where the tonic is given, which
