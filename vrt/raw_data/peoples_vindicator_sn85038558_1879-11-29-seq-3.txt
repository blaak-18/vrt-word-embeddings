The Grtmnback leaders now affect
great wrath at the little BULLETIN,
and say it Is to blame for their going
headlong into the cesspool of Radi.
calism. Too thin, gentlemen, too
thin. Look at your LtrroRx. There
you have published to the world that t
you will defend Radicalism, that you
will aid and abet and give comfort to
the thieves that have robbed and
plundered us for the last fourteen
long and dreary years. Some few d
good Democrats have gone into e
this sneaklang and treacherous move
ment, not knowing the ultimate de- y
signs of the leaders. These were de- P
ceived by belog told that it was not
opposed to the Democracy, that they
were going to vote fifteen hundred n
colored voters for the Democratic J
State ticket, provided they were
Ial)wed to elect the parish officers. h
Such pledges could never be fulfilled, ci
and it wts never intended that they
should be. It was done to lull the
people into a sense of security until a
these vain, ambitious and unscrupu
lous schemers could get into power,
$ad become the successorsof a Blunt,
R iby, Boullt, the predas and other e
tad men who have disturbed our peo
ple in the past. In order to achieve I
their ends they have acted with sys
tematic duplicity. They have en
sleavored to deceive and to betray the ti
Democratic party. Having failed d
in this, they are even nowacting with
the most glaring treachery and bad
faith with each other. ~ be fact is u
the rats are cornered and are deeper.

squirm.
BUBWELL ON THE JEWS.
Burwell, the tow-ead orator, comn.
pliments our Jew friends, by saying ti
that if the negroes emigrated to Ean- (I
as, they would follow them, because
the Jews, were like hogs picking up
acorns under a tree, and as long as
the acorns were there, they would
only care to be where they came
from, or in other words, that the ne
groes as cotton growers, furnished
them with their chief support. How
do our friends like such taltk
Burwell, the Radical orator, in his
speech here, last Saturday, said that
Yankees, as a class, were opposed to
labor, and as such never did any ti
more work then they could help,
hence their use of steam power$steam

their erops. The statement might
