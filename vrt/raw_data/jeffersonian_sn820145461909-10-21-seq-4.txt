ated Charities, is quoted as saying in
reference to the conduct of the State
constabulary during the strike at
McKees Rocks plant:
“The State constabulary did its
work efficiently, and was heartily
glad when the strike was over. The
men were young, clean, disciplined,
and of a high calibre. This body
consists of picked men, with previous
army training, always in good condi
tion, and ready for action. Tn the
thickest of the fight precipitated by
the rashness of the deputy sheriff
. . . the troopers, even when sur
rounded by a fighting mob of men,
were careful where they shot.”
In other words, in spite of inci
dental brutalities, the Pennsylvania
troops did not want to shoot down
Pennsylvania men.
Next year such situations may be
wholly different. Instead of State
troops dealing with State situations,
we will have a national military
body, and logical tactics will be to
send strange troops into . turbulent
regions. There will be no immediate
feeling of brotherhood, none of the
spirit that actuates the citizens of the
same commonwealth. New York sol
diers can be sped to shoot down Col
orado miners; Massachusetts troops,
with ancient prejudice against “rebel
States”, can be sent to quell rioting
in the South. There will remain not

within the next ten years.

left in the carnival of corruption.
Some of the results of Tammany

They are about right, though.
The blundering and ineffectual ef
forts to regulate railroads and street
railways, without boldly taking over
the ownership of these utilities, will
always prove more a “source of an

abuse of railway power. The old
saw about grasping the nettle applies
to these big problems, and those too

Although his case, as a mere effort
to delay, is to be taken before the
Supreme Court of the United States
on a writ of certiorari, that body is
very little likely to trouble itself on
behalf of Mr. Morse.
A jail is not a pleasant place, and
the loss of liberty is about the worst
a human being can sustain. It seems
unavoidably necessary, however, if
the callous consciences of such pi
rates as those of the Morse type are
to be reached that drastic measures
be employed. Public opinion is a
joke with them, and fines of feather
weight; and to respect the law they
must understand that it applies to
them as well as to the poor criminal
who perhaps never had a chance to
do right.

Governor Franklin Fort, of the latter
State, uttered some bitter truths
in his retiring speech some weeks
ago. He made the frank, pathetic
admission that all he had hoped to
do in the way of reform had been
set at naught by the ring which is
running the State. One can not help
but rather admire Governor Fort for
saying this, if it be true. One man,
no matter how honest, or strong, or
inspired, can not break the shackles
that years of indifference and cor
ruption have forged. His admission
of complete failure must have been
a bitter one to make. It might have
been easier for him to gloss over the
miserable record by pointing to some
trifles that he had accomplished and
letting the big issues alone. He was
not justifying himself for another
election, because under the Constitu
tion he could not run, anyhow. So
the confession was not as candidate
to voter, explaining, apologizing, jus
tifying—but as man to man, show
ing that the State of New Jersey is
in a pretty bad fix, and that the
populace need not expect a few re
form candidates to do it all.
Herr Bebel is perhaps the greatest
living exponent of Socialism. He is
a man who might be termed a
self-made German mechanic; and
that he is a powerful man is amply
proved by the fact that he leads the
German Socialists his way despite
the keen rivalry of other would-be
leaders. He knows what he is talk
ing about. He has no patience with
froth or subterfuge. When Herr Be
bel discusses the position of women
as it would be under Socialism he
gives an accurate forecast. No wo
man can afford not to read Mr. Wat
son’s conclusions after the examina

a Socialist’s Bible, so to speak.
