Fairfield , lowa, Has First
Carnegie Public Library
FAIRFIELD, lA.—While today
there are more than 210 public li
braries in lowa, many of which are
buildings donated by the renowned
philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie,
Fairfield has the double distinction
of having the first Carnegie- public
library west of Allegheny City, Pa.,
and one of the few if not the only one
to which Mr. Carnegie contributed
without conditions of support.
The Jefferson county library at
Fairfield, which later became the
Fairfield library, was founded in the
spring of 1853. On the shelves of the
library was the then imposing array
of 627 volumes and the institution
thrived continually even through the
exigencies of the Civil war.
Senator James F. Wilson, early in
his life, took an active intereset in
the Fairfield library and in later
years he was instrumental in induc
ing Mr. Carnegie to donate $40,000
for the erection of its present home.
The philanthropist made no stipula
tion such as was made in subsequent
Jears, when he announced his gift to
'airfield. , , . ,
“If you will see that the land is
donated, I will give $40,000 to this
splendid cause,” Mr. Carnegie wrote
Senator Wilson.
Senator Wilson and Mrs. Wilson do
nated the land and plans for the
building which were perfected in
1892 and the building was completed
and ready for occupancy the succeed
ing year.
The building is a three story, fire
proof structure built of Lake Super
ior red sandstone and pressed brick.
The lecture room seated with opera
chairs will hold 300 persons. The
large museum hall, reading room,
•tack reoms and other rooms furnish

ample accommodations for every de
partment even today. The structure
was built originally to meet such
demands as the growing city would
place upon it. There are thousands
of volumes upon the shelves.
Throughout the state of lowa
there are 100 Carnegie libraries. The
first was erected here in 1893 and the
last at Logan, lowa, in 1920 at a cost
of SIO,OOO. The smallest Carnegie li
brary in the state is at Lorenz and
is an attractive rambling one-story
building costing $3,800. Before the
library at Davenport erected its pres
ent $185,000 addition, the library at
Dubuque which cost Mr. Carnegie
SIOO,OOO in 1902, was the largest and
most pretentious in the state. The
latter city still claims the distinction
of having the largest “Carnegie li
brary” however, since the addition to
the Davenport institution was paid
for by the city taxpayers.
Since the first Carnegie library was
erected here in the latter part of the
nineteenth century, fully $1,000,000
of Mr. Carnegie’s money has been
spent in such institutions in lowa.
Libraries erected in lowa with the
aid of Mr. Carnegie’s philanthropy
and amounting to more than $25,000
are located in the following cities of
the state: Dubuque, 1902, $100,000;
Cedar Rapids. 1905, $75,000; Daven
port. 1904, $76,000; Sioux City, 1903,

Fairfield. 1893. $40,000; lowa City,
1904, $35,000; Fort Dodge, 1904. $30,-

Mason City, 1904, $30,000.
Writing for Papers
(Wichita Eagle)
Every editor knows that Jack Lait
knows something about newspapers.
Ja«k Lait uaed to be a reporter in
Chicago, and then he was almost ev
erything else about a metropolitan
newspaper office—until he learned
that he could make more money
writing what he had observed during
his reportorial days. Now Jack Lait
is making hogsheads of money, and it
is said that he has got more of his
stuff into print than any other man
In the world ever got into print in
his lifetime.
AVENUE
In Lait’s many stories, there is a
good deal of newspaper philosophy.
Here is a little snatch of it that is
appropriate for digestion by the in
numerable host of graphomaniacs
that has the itch to write but lacks
all the other qualities that go to
ward making a writer for the papers:
There is nothing—that is paid for
quite as easy as “writing for the pa
pers.” Any messenger boy, school
teacher, telephone operator or shoe
clerk will tell you so.
What is there “to it?” One need
only write what one sees, hears and
knows; and anyone can do that, and
most people will bet you they can
do it Detter than it is being done in
this or any other journal. Why, it
isn’t even necessary to be able to
spell correctly! Proofreaders are
there to look after that.
The veriest boob realizes that run
ning an elevator requires technique,
that curving a baseball is a gift; tnat
spinning and bricklaying and tooth
pick sharpening and other trained
trades require study and application;
that professoring and doctoring and
toothnulling aren’t guesswork; that
prizefighting calls for unusual tal
ents. and drawing pictures is a tricky
stunt. But journalism gee, you don’t
even have to be good-looking, as you
must be in the movies, or popular,
as you must be to be elected to of
fice!
That one newspaper writer gets $25
a week and another gets more than
that an hour, is pure luck, then.
That one newspaper is a mighty pow
er and another is a blowsy rag is a
whim of chance.
It might astound a few of these lay
buddies to know that the profession
of writing for papers is one of the
most complex, intricate, elusive and
intensively specialized callings as well
as requiring a natural vocation, and
that writing is only one of dozens of
branches of the labyrinthian and in
ter-involved science, art and business
of “getting out” a paper.

PARTY POLITICS ARE
BEHIND KLAN ATTACK
Democratic Presidential Aspir
ant Addresses Mississippi
Solons
ATLANTA, GA, March 22.—That
party politics has as much to do
with the attack by Underwood on the
Klan, and probably more, than any
motive prompted by patriotic im
pulses, ia evident from his speeeh be
fore the Mississippi legislature last
week. His words indicate the stand
of the leading Democratic demago
gues with reference to patriotism
and partisan politics, as wiitness the
following from his speech before the
Mississippi legislature recently:
“I am not going to say anything
personally offensive against the mem
bers of. the Ku Klux Klan, but I
think they are committing one of
the gravest errors of judgment, of
government and of high principles
that any set of men ever commit
ted * • *.
“• * * who makes up the demo
cracy of the northern states? Forty
eight per cent of the doubtful states
of this union that you appeal to in
a national election are foreign born;
or the sons and daughters of foreign
born. They are often captained by
men of the Catholic faith; they are
often sustained by men of the Jew
ish religion. It is these men who be
lieve that this country was a land of
freedom and a land of liberty, and
that the Democratic party stood for
the old time principles of Thomas
Jefferson, who have held up our
hands and made our party great * *
“* * * My friend, and I do not
say it unkindly, but if I can look in
the face of one of these great Klan
leaders, let us ‘Stop, Look and Lis
ten’ as to what you are doing; where
you are going, when you say to men
that no man who is a foreign born
can hold office in this country; that
no man who is of Catholic faith can
hold office; that no man who belongs
to the chosen race of God’s people
can hold office. I understand that is
what you say, and that you reject
them if they do. And yet these men
captain and control the democracy
of the north. * * * It is these
men, and this democracy of the
north, that has sustained you in the
great principles of government that
under the administration of Wood
row Wilson you wrote upon the
statute books of this country and
are proud of.”

Alleged Slayers of Klansman
Caesar Cagle to Blame for
Lawlessness
MARION. ILL.. March 22.—Sheriff
George Galligan of Williamson coun
ty and John Layman, his chief de
puty, were indicted in the United
States district ceurt at Danville
last week for conspiracy to defeat
the enforcement of the national pro
hibition act.
These men are ringleaders of the
element that murdered Constable
Caeaar Cagle, Klansman, here some
weeks ago, and whose lawlessness
furnished the excuse for calling out
the national guard.
A citizen of Herrin, describing the
indictments and the conditions that
led to them, said:
“On the night of December 15,
1923, a meeting in a Herrin garage
between Galligan and Layman and
S. Glenn Young, noted law enforce
ment officer, working for the Klan,
and Harry Steyer of Galconia, one of
Young's men, it is charged, that
Galligan and Layman accepted SIOO
each in return for promising to pro
tect a certain place near the slaugh
ter house outside of Marion.”

THE FIERY CROSS
KUN TO STAMP OUT
NARCOTIC TRAFFIC
State Officers to Be Assisted by
Members of Chicago
Order
CHICAGO, ILL., March 22.—Not
content with aiding prohibition en
forcement officers in the perform
ance of their duty, members of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are or
ganizing to expose the dispensers ol
“dope” here and throughout the
state. The best citizens of each
community, members of the oicani
zation are being “drafted” to tvr
operate with state and federal offi
cials in the eradication of all forms
of the drug evil. Details of the plan
are not to be made public by Klan
officials as secrecy is one of the es
sentials of its success.
Klansmen have long realized that
“dope” is the inspiration of much of
the vice and crime that character
izes the foreign sections of this and
other cities. Its use is said to be
particularly prevalent among the
negroes of the “Near South Side.”
“Klansmen are not planning the
campaign solely to arrest and con
vict the dispensers of cocaine, mor
phine, heroin, opium, hasheesh and
other drugs of a similar nature, but
are looking toward a reclamation and
reformation program that will en
able the unfortunate addicts to start
life anew,” declared a spokesman for
the organization.
The Klan’s investigators are said
to have already uncovered evidence
of “dope rings” that do business on
a Large scale in addition to having
the “goods” on a number of “ped
dlers” whose traffic is on smaller
scale.
Scores of arrests are expected to
follow.
The Old Order
Chan&eth
(From the “Birdeye Views of Far
Lands” by James T. Nichols, of Dee
Moines.)
AS THE bishop of the Methodist
church he had been there about
six months when one day a
fine looking young Filipino came to
his home and asked for a private in
terview. He insisted on having the
doors and windows closed and blinds
all down. Mr. Stuntz said he has
no idea what the man wanted. When
they were alone with the door locked
and with evidence of great agitation
the young man said: “I have come
many miles to see you and ask you a
question that means more to us Fili
pinos than any other question that I
could ask.” Mr. Stuntz said that as
yet he had no idea what was troubl
ing the man until he continued: "I
want to know, sir, if it is now safe —
the soldiers say it is, but I cannot
believe it —to have a copy of the Pro
testant Bible in my house and read it
to my family?”
Mr. Stuntz said the whole thing
seemed so strange to him that he
was silent for a moment, when the
man continued: “Sir, this is a very
important question to us Filipinos.
You know the law under which we
have lived here is this,’’ and quoting
from Section 219 of the Penal Code
of Spain in the Philippines, said: “It
any person or persons shall preach
or teach or otherwise maintain any
doctrine or doctrines not established
by the state, he shall be deemed
guilty of a crime and shall be pun
ished at the direction of the judge.”
Then, to the amazement of Mr.
Stuntz, the man continued: “Under
the operation of that law my own
father was dragged from our house,
and we never saw him alive again.
That was when I was eleven years
old. I have supported my mother as
best I could, and now I have a wife
and two children. I want to know
if it is safe.”
It was with a heart thrilling with
pride that this great American took
the young man to the window and as
he opened the blind and the window
itself and saw the stars and stripes
proudly waving in the breeze, and
with tears running down his face
said to him: “My dear man, as long
as yonder flag waves over the city
you may take the Bible and climb
up on the ridgeboard of your house
at high noon each day, three hundred
and sixty-five days in the year and
read it as loud as you can and no
man shall harm you.” Three months
later Mr. Stuntz went to that man’s
home city, spoke from half past sev
en until midnight, announced that
he would speak in the same building
at six o’clock the next morning,
and an hour before the appointed
time five hundred people were in
line waiting to get in.

PEORIA, ILL., March 24.—With a
Klan and anti-Klan fight to spur in

the coming elections in Peoria. Re
gistration of voters this spring far

Ku Klux Klan has nominated its

Loser Will Banquet All Klans*
men in Fulton County on
Anniversary
ATLANTA, GA., March 22 -When
the eighth anniversary of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan rolls around,
John B. Gordon Klan or Nathan Bed
ford Forrest Klan is going to be the
host to the other at a banquet. Just
which it will be depends upon the
activities of the members thereof
between now and May 6, which will
mark the end of their race in the
membership campaign.
These two Klans are very evenly
matched in more ways than one. In
the first place, they are both up-town
Klans; and in the second place, their
membership is about equal. There
fore, the only handicap either of
them will have to labor under will be
the inactivity of their individual
members. However, so far neither
of the Klans seems to be impeded by
any lack of enthusiasm on the part
of members.
So sure is Nathan Bedford Forrest
Klan of winning the race, which is
at present neck and neck, they are
seeking to ring in the state officers
on the banquet. The Klaliff in this
behalf says:
“As far as we are concerned, we
will make it a condition of the race
that all Fulton county Klansmen be
invited to the banquet to feast at
the expense of the losers. However,
that is a matter that is of more in
terest to the John B. Gordon Klan
than to Nathan Bedford Forrest Klan,
since they will have to pay for the
feed. You know our motto is ‘lt
shall be done.’”
The Chief of the Klokan of John
B. Gordon Klan, in voicing the sen
timent of that Klan with reference
to the race, and when his attention
was called to the motto of the Na
than Bedford Forrest Klan, said:
"We are wishing them all the luck
in the world; however, we feel that
the luck will be on the side of the
Klan that works the hardest. And
in this connection I wish to call their
attention to our motto, which is
‘Let’s Go,’ which always, in our case,
means it is three-fourths done.”
Klan Leader Talks
to Congregation
KINGMAN, KAN., March 22.—Vis
iting the church at Brown Spur,
where an evangelistic service was in
progress recently, several Klansmen
presented the Rev. Mr. Butler, pas
tor, with an envelope, containing S6O.
With the group facing the audience,
the leader made a short talk after
the presentation was made. After
the pastor lead them in prayer the
knights retired.
Of the 160,000 children who have

of the Near East Belief with the
relief idea eliminated a* an edu

large number of these dependent
children have been given elementary
schooling and are self-supporting.
The continuation of this work, the
Christian Century believes, would he

will.
panying the money explained that
the gift was in appreciation of the
divine’s efforts in making Elk Gar
den a better town in which to live,
and complimented him upon his good
work. After reading the note, Mr.
Dugger enunciated a prayer and
thanked the Klansmen, after which
they marched silently out of the
church.
THOMAS, W. VA.—Eleven mem
bers of the Thomas Klan, Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, went to Dobson,
Maryland, Sunday evening last, and
gave the Rev. J. W. Sheridan, pastor
of the Dobson church, a substantial
cash donation. The money was pre
sented prior to the usual preaching
services. The Rev. Mr. Sheridan ac
cepted the money and expressed his
appreciation. The Klansmen were
extended an invitation to remain for
the services, but declined.
Bereaved Minister,
Aided by Klansmen
STFPORD, KAN., March 22.—At
a recent meeting of the local Klan
a silver offering was taken and sent
to the Rev. B. E. Dobbins, pastor of
the United Presbyterian church, as
an appreciation of the sterling worth
of his good Christian family in the
community and also as a token of
sympathy to the family, a ten year
old daughter having died.
