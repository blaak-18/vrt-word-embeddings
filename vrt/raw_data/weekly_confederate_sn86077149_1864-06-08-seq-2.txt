T. Sidoniu Lemay, is among the killed iu tho
recent battles in Virginia. We have heard none
of tbe particulars concerning his death, but
understand that positive assurances of the fact
have been received here. Lt. Lemay has been
in the service almost from tbe very beginning
of the war, and has borne the uniform character
of a brave, faithful christian soliier and geutlc

And how is the tbing to be prevented ? We
.s tt is. state of things may occur, without
iiiv possibility of a decLiou by any tribunal to
or arrest it. Toe only -remaining qus
lion is, was thereaay persoiaI liberty infringed
m North Carolina, to such a degree as to re
.jijire this uadisguiodly hostile legislation
against our own Government ? It canuot be
asserted. On the contrary, the Confederate
Government has most studiously deferred to
the State judiciary, before acting on the main
pirstiou which provokes controversy ; and in
a few weeks, when a decision of the Supreme
Court can be had on the constitutionality of
the act of Congress, the question may be
settled. For, if the at be sustained, the
matter U ended; but if the act bo pro
i.ourxed -unconstitutional, then the citizen
is not left unprotected ; for commissioners
woru under the same solemnities as judges,
i-oiind by the same obligations as judges, it
tiLg as judges, these commissioners them
selves beiug our own citizens, try the dlspu
ted cases, and if they are not discharged, they
are delivered over for trial before the Con
federate coon wherein a judge presides
who is as much a North Carolinian as any
other judge. To this reasonable, sale conne,

hates with an intensity equal to his devotion to
his native Southern land.
Capt. Gorman has been in the service from
the very beginning, and until the time of the
fight in which the above casualty occurred,
has been several times wounded, but none of
them of a serious character. He possessed the
confidence aud esteem ef his brigade aud divisiou
commanders in a remarkable degree, aud was
often selected by them for the accomplishing of
difficult and dangerous exploits, in all of which
he succeeded. He "is one of the uv-st correct
and thrilling writers of events on the battle
field, and our readers will miss much by being
deprived of the interesting Tetters of " J. C. G . "
We arc glad to hear that young Luige.e the
sun of Mr. W J Lougue of this city, has not been
killed, aj reported on yesterday. A dispatch to
day reports him as captured. W"e wondered '
when wc beard that this youn;; man had been
conscripted and 'sent into tbe field; we can't con
cicve why he was not assigned to light duty
for which only he was fitted. It is a great
relief to his frieuds to hear of Lis escape from
death -, though he has tho ruisfortuuc to be a

Breckiuridgo's and Hoke's divisions had re
pulsed them iu three attacks ou our ri"ht
near Gaines' mill and that we were drivuig
them at ail poims.
The accounts we have been able to, gather
were meagre and fragmentary. The battle we
have summed up in a word, was about this :
The enemy assaulted our lines near Odd
Harbour, but were repulsed at every point,
except Biioiridge's front, whose lines they
succeeded in breaking and capturing two guns
ef a battery; killing and wounded fifteen men
at the two guns. Our men were soon rallied.

Ii'iring the evening id' yesterday Longstreet's
line Was heavily engaged in -akirmishiug, and
just before dark the enemy assaulted Hoke, on
our extreme-xigbt, bur were gallantly repulsed.
About nifiht, whilst Geu. Wd'cox was shelling
the ground near MtCh iianV bridge, preparatory
to occupying it, Brig. Gen. Lau was wounded
severely in the thigh by a cliarpshuoter. The
enemy are unquestionably picking off our Geu
erul olhccrs.
lt is also said that the enemy were most hand
somely repulsed duriug the day in frott of
Rodes and Iieth on our extreme right. The
slaughter of the eaemy has been quite heavy,
some put it as high :h ten thousand. Three or
four hundred wiH cover our list of casualties.
Tbe situation at the cloie of the day was this ;
Grant had made violent efforts to turn and break
onr right, but had been most successfully re
pulsed aud the Yankee army heavily punl-died ,
our men holding almost every inch of ground
and the Yankees gaining nothing. Lke Spot
sylvauiaC H.; it isa mostdisaHtrous.aiid bloody
check." Butler is said to have united with
Grant, aud some of bis troops are said to havS
been in the battle to-day.
