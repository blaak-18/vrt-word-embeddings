WHAT IS THE SHIP SUBSIDY?
Dear Sir:—Will you kindly pub
lish in the Weekly Jeffersonian a
statement of just what the Ship Sub
sidy bill is? its excuse for ever being
proposed? the reason why its passage
. should be thwarted and the possi
bility of its becoming a law?
I am, and have been, a close read
er of The Jeffersonians since their be
ginning. Very truly yours,
1, M. MOBLEY.
Santuck, S. C., Route 1.
Answer.
The proposition, in its latest form,
is to take millions of dollars out of
our postal revenues, and give the
money, as a bonus, to the few Ameri
can ship-owners who are running
ships to South America, Australia
and Oceanica. Nobody but those, fa
vored few would be benefited.

IMPORTANCE OF THE FINANCIAL
QUESTION.
Dear Brother Watson: —Ah, Thom
as, you doubter—you fiery fire
eater —you hit hard and square, but
you hit too many things, and do not
always discriminate as carefully as I
could wish you would. Where I
think you are wrong, I can not take
off my hat to you; but where I think
you are right, I admire your pluck.
The money rings and the money
kings are chiefly responsible for the
sad plight of this land, and when
ever you discuss the financial ques
tion, you send terror into the souls of
the money sharks; but when you
switch off to side issues, you seem to
be a shorn Samson. That is the way
at least that it appears to me. It
was the currency contraction, after
the War, which did more to transfer
the wealth of the nation to non-pro
ducers than was done by all other
causes. You know this, and know it
so clearly that you are able to so
tell it that every man who reads
after you will know it too.
Now the knights of high finance
are delighted to have you let them
alone and give it to the Missionary
Boards, the protective tariff, the
woolly-pated wards of reconstructive
legislation, or anything else that
comes handy. You can smash So
cialism more effectively by discuss
ing and exposing the schemes of the
promoters of the system of high
finance, than any other way. Those
fellows are behind Socialism far
enough to divert attention from
themselves. D. B. TURNEY,

WE STAND CORRECTED.
Dear Sir:—l have been looking
over some of your old magazines, and
in the issue of September, 1908, I
find some questions asked and an
swered. lam not smart, but I wish
to cprrect you in two places. In an
swer to question No. 3, you say that
greenbacks—treasury notes —are ab
solute legal tender, except for cus
toms duties, and interest and princi
pal of the bonds. The greenback
says this note is legal tender at its
face value for all debts, public and
private, except duties on imports and
interest on public debts.
In your last answer, on page 5G9,
you say the gold reserve is a useless
thing, and I agree with you, but
either you or I don’t understand that
reserve. The law says when that re
serve falls below so much, the Gov
ernment must sell bonds to replete
the gold reserve. You remember
Carlisle was Treasurer when Grover
Cleveland was President, and in his
report he tells how many bonds he
sold and how much he got in gold
for each batch he sold in 1893 and
1894, and when he tells how much
he got for each, he says that these
bonds were all sold at par for gold
to replete the gold reserve. So, with
that dirty reserve, we were bonded
to the tune of $262,000,000. That
is what w r e get for the law to swap
dollars one for the other.
Yours truly,
DAVID YEAGLEY.
Walkertown, Indiana.
WE ARE ANXIOUS TO HAVE THEM
ALL ON LISTS.
Dear Sir:—lnclosed please find
P. O. money order for SI.OO for the
weekly Jeffersonian and Southern
Cultivator.
If you will send me some sample
copies of Magazine and Jeffersonian,
I will try to get you some subscribers.
I don’t see why every farmer, and
especially every Union man, in the
nation don’t take at least one of your
publications. I have been almost a
constant subscriber to your litera
ture from the Alliance until the pres
ent day, and am going to remain so
as long as you continue to publish
any.
Why? Because I do think that
you are sound on reforms on all the
topics that I remember that you have
written on.
I have thought a long time that
this mission business, or the mode of
the same, was wrong. I have been
so disgusted at some language that I
have heard in the past, in the form
of prayers, such as the following,
“O Lord, give the people a desire
to give until it hurts, and keep on
giving until it don’t hurt,” and many
amens followed.
I will close for this time.
Yours truly,
J. L. JONES.
FROM AN OLD GREENBACKER,
OF NEW YORK.
Dear Sir: —Enclosed find renewals
for my Magazine and Weekly. I
want to be on time this year,—not
have to wait even one day. The pa
per gets to Clinton almost every
Saturday at noon, but not always.
When it doesn’t come, I am a very
uneasy old man all Sunday.
There are three or four Socialists
in Clinton. Two of them have been
at me many times to read the Ap
peal. I tell them that I know what
Socialism is, and don’t think there is
one Socialist hair in my head. After
reading the magazine, am now sure
there is not one—at least of the Herr
Bebel kind. I have shown them the
magazine, and I don’t think they will
stay with the party.
Your answer to Brother Brand
was fine. lam an old Greenbacker,
and I know about contraction of the
X3be Jeffersonian
currency, and how people lost their
homes. I, having good health, and
but one child, did not lose mine. Am
hoping we shall some day get back to
the old landmarks.
As I told you last year, I am not
used to writing letters, —wife does
that. I read, walk and work, and
am about as regular as an old clock.
Haven’t been sick for seventy-one
years. I am that old English shoe
maker, who picked up what little he
does know on the shoe bench.
Yours truly,
ROBERT CAPERS.

NEGRO DOMINATION AND UNRE
STRICTED IMMIGRATION- OUR
DEADLY DANGERS.
Dear Mr. Watson:—A few days
ago the “scare-heads” of the Wash
ington papers told of an ignorant
Italian, employed as a track-walker
by the railroad company, placing -an
obstruction upon the track in the
new Union Station tunnel of this
city, with the diabolical intention of
derailing an incoming passengei'
train from the South. The murder
ous wretch confessed that his idea
in doing this was to cause a wreck,
which would shoulder the American
workman in charge with criminal
negligence and lead to his being su
perseded by an Italian.
A more fiendish and senseless
crime can not well be imagined, but
upon whom does the actual respon
sibility really fall? Upon the ignor
ant brute of an Italian employee, or
upon the more refined brute of a
railroad official who hired him?
Mr. Watson, notwithstanding the
press-made wave of prosperity that
is sweeping over this country, all
thoughtful and disinterested men
see, with fearful forebodings, the
miseries of our people daily increas
ing and awful abuses constantly en
gulfing our trust-ridden land. Never
were greater crimes committed in the
name of justice than the insatiable
greed displayed by the devouring
monopolies under the sanctity of law.
Well may we behold their merciless
operations and tyrannical sway, look
longingly back upon the country of
our forefathers, and sigh for the
liberties that were. These monopo
lies create the poverty upon which
they thrive, and one of the surest
means, which they have used to de
base the living standard of our peo
ple, has been the GROVELLING,
MONGRELIZED, ITALIAN LAZZA
RONI, whom they have shipped
across the Atlantic like cattle to
compete with, and beat down the
wages of, the American laborer.
Were any one to ask my opinion
as to the causes of our national de
cay, I should unhesitatingly say, first,
the enfranchisement of the negro,
and, second, the influx of unrestrict
ed immigration. Upon these two
pillars of servility and ignorance
rests the infamous arch of the PRO
TECTIVE SYSTEM. In addition to
LOCAL FARMERS’ UNIONS!
Don’t you think that Duckworth
owes it to the Union to answer those
questions? POP IT TO HIM IN
YOUR RESOLUTIONS.
contaminating our public morals, the
Italian serf and the shiftless negro
are an industrial curse, and, as their
coerced votes are the deciding factor
in State, Congressional and Presi
dential elections, they perpetuate the
rule of blatant, political thieves in
office. Athwart the horizon of our
civilization is ominously shadowed
the ravenous claw's of the black
rapist and the bloody stiletto of the
Italian Black Hand.
The Washington case above cited
is typical of public supineness
heartless indifference. Their (sic)
courts of law' will send the would-be
Italian murderer to prison to rot
where he belongs, but the real crimi
nals, the criminals w'ho are tramp
ling humanity into the low’est depths
of grinding poverty, the privileged
criminals who are menacing the very
fabric of our civilization, the real
criminals who clothed the irresponsi
ble creature in this case with respon
sibility, will not so much as be in
dicted. O Justice, how r many crimes
are committed in thy name!
A SUBSCRIBER AND ADMIRER.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 4, 1909.
