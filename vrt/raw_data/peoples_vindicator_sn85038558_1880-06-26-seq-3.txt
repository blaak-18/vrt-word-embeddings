At the Death Bed.
There is no scene more impressive I
than the death-bed. Tho manly F
form stretched upon the couch, with
the lamp of life flickering, and a
lovely female voice Intoning the I
priyPrs for-the dead;according to the
rites of th. ' Catholic Church. Such
a sctne w o witnessed last Monday,
at the death-hed of F. C. FORD, and
although a stranger, the ordeal to
us was m trying one. Mr. FoRD was
In the prIiae of life, being only 26
years old, and though ailing for
some time, only lay down a short
time previous to his demise. He was
kind anti generous in disposition,
honestand upright In his dealings,
and left many sad hearts in Natchl.
toches to mourn his untimely end.
The closing hours of his life were
smoothed by loving friends, and his
Sdying eyes were closed as tenderly as
o his nearest relatives were at his
bed side.
Such was his end : A calma release,
No clingings to its mortal clod;
iHe elosed his eyes and stood in peace
lBefore a smiling nod.
On Tuesday evening the body was g
borne to the Catholic Church, where e
the bervicee for the dead were read
by Rev. Father Dicharry, aecompa- f
nied by the choir of the churobh. The t
pealing anthems that went up for the
departed spirit were solemn remind
or of the uncertainty of human .life,
The services over, the cortege moved

It will be seen from this that the
worms have aprared geener.sllyv
about the 20th Julie snld deýtltr,,d
the crop about the 20th AugUst, or
about sixty days after their first ap
pearance. It also appears from this
that the weather has no.. eltcular
influence, as some suppoAe, on them,
for in 1875 and 1876, when the rain
fall was less than half that of sue.
ceeding and preceding years, the
appearance of the worm and their
destruction of the cotton crop was
accomplished about the same time.
Prof. Charles V. Riley, chief of the
United States Enthomologicsl Com
mission, has issued a report of the
s natural history of the cotton worm,
its enemies, and the best means of
controlling them, which we com
men~d to all our farmers. as well
worthy their consideration.
Prof. Riley is still engaged in the
al great work, especially to us, of a
