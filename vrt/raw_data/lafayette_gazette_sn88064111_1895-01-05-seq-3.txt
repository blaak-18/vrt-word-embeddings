be successful wherever he may go.
The gentlemanly and ever courte
ous drummer, Ben Lewis, of New
Orleans, was in Lafayette Thurs
day.
The Midway Plaisance troop filled
an engagement here last Thursday.
Their show was by far the poorest
that has come to Lafayette this sea
son. It required sublime nerve on
the part of these people to show in a
civilized community. The tableaux
and mandolin player were the only
redeeming features of the entertain
ment. In justice to Manager Falk,
it is right to say that he was im
posed upon as well as the public.
We are pleased to state that
Louise, Mr. Felix Begnaud's little
child who was burned about the
chest and face last Friday night, is
doing very well and is out of dan

very vigorous kicks against the law

party was given on New Year's eve.
·I
ing by Miss Rose Duhon. The
games generally indulged in by the
young folks were played amid much
joy and merriment. A splendid
eggnogg and some delicious cakes
were served to the guests, who
pleasantly spent a few more hours,
after which they bade goodnight to
their hospitable hostess.
The news of the killling at Rayne
of Officer Mac Lyons was received
with deep regret by a number of
our peole who knew him and ap
preciated his many good qualities.
His genial dispositiotn and unitorm
cordiality had won for him the es

was a cousin of Sheriff Brousssard,
who was much pained by his death.

On next Sunday will be presented
at Falk's Opera I-louse, this city, a
unique entertainment, and which
will, no doubt, be worthy of a liber
al patronage, in the form of a musi
cale by a company of South Ameri
can Indians, highly edlucated in the
art of music on their favorite instru
mcht, the marimba. Space forbids
further description of this company
or their melodious instruments,
which, it is said resembles in tone
the zylophone, and to. better under
stand and appreciate this company
of natives, our people should pro

Charity--Old and New.
The problem of Charity is be
coming one of the pressing econ
omic question of our day, and it is
rapidly changing its social charac
ter from a perfunctory matter of
Christian sentiment to an alarming
factor in the economic problem of
the business of civilized society.
In the January Arena there is a
very interesting and valuable dis
cussion of this whole question, in
its various aspects, historical and
contemporary. Accompanying the
article is an extensive bibliograpy
of the subject, including contem
porary as well as old and rare au
thorites, which will .be of inestim
able value to the student.

A Midway Man in Trouble.
Louis Striffer, one of the managers
of the Midway Plaisance Company,
was arrested Friday morning by
Sheriff Broussard, upon complaint
of Harry St. George, a performer
for the same company. St. George
informed the officer that Striffer
had a pistol concealed on his per
son. To the sheriff Striffer ad
mitted the correctness of the charge
and gave up his pistol. The pro
per affidavit was madeand he pleaded
guilty before Justice McFadden .vho
fixed his appearance bond at $zoo.
The prisoner could not furnish the
required bail and was committed
to jail. St. George claimed that Strif
fer refused to pay him and the other
performers and was about to take
a train for New Orleans and to pre
vent him from leaving he had him
arrested. Striffer denies this charge
iand says that he had only $7 in cash
besides railroad fare to New Orleans

A SOCIETY EVENT.
An Elegant Dance Given by the
Young Men of Lafayette
on New Year's Eve.
One of the most enjoyable social
events of the season was, that ten
.'.red the young ladies of Lafayette
by the young men on New Year's
eve. The night was clear and fair
and the temperature for dancing
just at'the, right point.
Through the kindness of Mr. and
Mrs. Hahn the large and spacious
dinirg hall of the Crescent News
Hotel was had for the purpose, and
it is undoubtedly an ideal place for
a dance. The floor was waxed un
til one could almost see himself re
flected therefrom, and gliding o-ver
its smooth surface to the entrancing
strains of an elegant string band
from Morgan City, the feet of the
dancers moved without an effort.
Fair lads and lassies were present
in full number, and many of our
fair neighbors assisted in welcoming
young "'95" as old "'94" gently
faded away into the misty past.
The ball-room presented a pretty
sight. Many handsome toilets were
noted, and Lafayette girls did them
selves credit. The grand march,
led by Mr. Ed Givens and Miss
Lovenskjold, was a lovely sight,
more than 30 couples taking part.
A little after x2 o'clock an ele
gant and substantial supper, pre
pared by Mrs. Hahn with excellent
taste, was served. It is needless to
say that all did full justice, and
many a happy New Year's bumper
was quaffed in sparkling wine. After
supper the young ladies and gentle
men surrounded Mr. and Mrs. Hahn,
and Mr. Ed Givens, in a neat little
speech, presented them with a
handsome pair of silver napkin
rings, as a slight testimonial of the
high esteem felt for them by the
young people of Lafayette.
The band began to play, and the
dancers once more whirled in the
mazy waltz. No stop was made un
til 5 o'clock warned them that day
was just ushering in another year.
Regretfully all began preparations
for going home, with many a sigh
that the night was so short.
Those present were:
Mines. T. . M. Bissat, F. Demanade, Jno.
Hahn, Misses Lettie Collins of Virginia, Em
ma Frere and Mary E. Saint of Franklin,
Leah LeBlanc, Bettie Rainer and Octavia
Broussard of Abbeville, Adelaide Lovensk

St. Stanislaus College.
BAY ST. Louts, Miss., Sunday Dec. 30, '94.
Sunday, Dec. o20, 1894, will be
an ever memorable clay in the an
nals of St Stanislaus College. On
that day was celebrated the golden
jubilee of the League of the Sacred
Heart. The programme was one
of a first class musical and dramatic
entertainment.
Strains of sweet music at a dis
tance made a very impressive ef
fect upon the audience. The three
essays "History of the Devotion to
the Sacred Heart," "Blessed Mar
garet Mary" and "The League of
the Sacred Heart" delivered res
pectively by Messrs. J. J. Kennedy,
F. V. Labarre and Wm. B. Ramsey,
were full of feeling. As the curtain
went up for the first act of the
drama entitled "Judgment at Heav
en's Gate," the eyes of the specta
tors were dazzled by the brilliancy
and rich color of the costumes.
All the actors performed their
parts remarkably well; but the fol
lowing especially evoked the repeat
ed applause of the cultured audience:
Mr. Jas. J. Kennedy, of New Or
leans, as St. John; Mir. S. ). Har
dee as count of Val de Grace and
Mr. F. J. Schwab and Chas Mun
son as angels.
Mr. WiVm. B. Ramsey deserves
special credit for the touching man
ner in which he delivered his essay,
"To Thee O! Heart of Jesus." A
song well known was admirably
rendered by Bro. Andrew, J. J.
Kennedy, F. Gallegher and F. J.
Schwab. Notwithstanding the un
favorable weather the audience was
very large and the grand study hall
was crowded. T'he manner in
which the stage was decorated was
a credit to the artistic taste of Prof.
)Ducrocq.
The exhibition was quite a success
and will not soon be forgotton by
the people of Bay St. I.ouis.

Charles J. Ranlett, a representa
tive of the Ferris Sugar Manufac
turing Company, appeared before
Justice McFadden Friday morning
and made an affidavit against Mr.
John Vigncaux for assault and bat
tery. As soon as Mr. Vigneaux
was informed of the charge against
him he presented himself before
Judge ,IcFadden, pleaded not guil
ty and asked for a speedy trial.
The case was fixed for 2 o'clock,
when the trial was commenced. The
testimory adduced went to show
that Messrs. Vigneaux and Ranlett
were engaged in a conversation in
the bank when the difficulty arose.
After hearing all the evidence pro
and con the judge took the case un
der advisement and will give his
decision today.

The people of New Iberia taught
a very good lesson to RMr. James
Corbett, the distinguished champion
pugilist, the other day. It seems
that Corbett and his troop failed to
give the people the whole enter
tainment as advertised, but a num
ber of gentlemen refused to be hum
bugged and demanded a reimburse
meit of the money they had paid
for admission. The famous boxer
was impressed with the fact that
the New Iberians were not in
a humor to be hoodwinked, and
he made a little speech in which he
told those who were not satisfied to
go to the door and get their money
back. Every person in the house
left and Carbett was reduced to the
painful necessity of playing to
empty seats or close the rformn
ance and he wisely chose n latter
alternatve. Iflall the fake shows
traveling were treated in a like man
ner theatre-goers would not be so
often deceived.
New York policemen have been
arresting women for smiling on the
streets. In one case, that of Miss
Hannah Posenthal, it was pro: ed at
the trial that a virtuous "peeler"
named Gill smiled at the fair ran -
nah, who, not wanting to be out
done in the smiling art, returned the
smile, whereupon Gill arrested her
and made a case against her for
illicit smiling. Now, all fair mind
ed people will admit that this is an
outrage perletrated against the
weaker sex. It's a right they have
to smile and no one should be per
mitted to infringe upon it. WVe be
lieve that Miss H-annah should carry
her case before the Supremne court,
and with that end in view we would
suggest that a subscription be raised
for the purpose of employing coun
sel, Bro. Greig of the St. Matin
ville Evangeline, is the right man
to take charge of the case, for in
his hands we feel confident that" the
God-given rights of the girls to
smile, kiss and firt, will be defend
ed against the a sault; of all eaomr-.
