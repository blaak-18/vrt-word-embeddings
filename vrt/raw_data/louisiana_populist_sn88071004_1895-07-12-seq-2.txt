Our neighbolr, the Coterplurie is
much worried over the good lickst
the "calanity howler" is getting in I
ton th tie goh ugs just rti now.
Sife says: "e woha spent o." ne
hlf his timrpe showing how oldbad
things were, and the otheandr hal

worse."
It this is ry,, arhsti wishe beis nlive it,

After rciting seuveri l ro w heo do

all of which came true, the inter- c
prise unwittingly exclaims: "Oh. v
what a miserable devwith ilthis calamitn

Our neighbor then concludes : a
"If every colmuboity ithd this great t

Mr. II. L. Brian, Editor POPULIST:
iehar Sir :--We organized here
yesterday a People's Party Club.
and wislh to thoroughly organize
I this parish aIs soon as lpossible.
We, of course desire to get in
line with the party in the State,
and to acquire general inforiation
as to the strength, orguanizattion and
Splans of the State party.
We recognize fully the plwer of
the presse and roIlnrse subscribing
to the Populist papers of the State
as fiar as pclssible.
Will you please send us sample
copies of the POPULIST, and give
notice of the organization of this
club.
Will, or can you give us ant ap-'
p- oximate idea of the number of
voters we have in Louisiana, or
any statistics bearing on the num
ber.
In 1892, St. Landly cast 183
votes for Tannehill, and inl 1891,
we gave (192 for Wilson, Populist
candidate foir Congress: In 1894,
three of our strongest Populist
Spolls were not open, because of 1
thousand. , 4I
We do not think 4 cent cotton,
ragged shirts, shoeless feet, and(
rmeatless dinners have reduced(!)

son, holpe to make our votes felt

To the Editor of the PorouLs :
After reading the proceedings of
the Democratic convention at Mnaem
phis, and noting its action on the
silver question, I would warn our
Populist friends against it as a de
lusion and a snare. The Demo
cratic party has lost its grip upon
the people, and it seeks to regain
it by a pretended sympathy with
us upon the question of silver.
That it is, as a party, insincere
and dishonest, we have had abund
ant proof.
The convention which nomina
tedthe man who now sits as the
figure-head of the United States
government at a salary of $50,000
per annum, (and who seems to be
the financial agent of England, in
effect), say him upon a platform,
the chief plank of which was la
beled "financial seform."
Upon this platform Mr. Cleve
land wriggled himself into the
Presidency. To the gold mono
metalists he was know to be of
them; to the silver men, or bimet
talliets, he msed to be their chanm
* That the peple should thus be
deceived and thus induced to vote
for him was beyond doubt fully
understood at the Wall street
