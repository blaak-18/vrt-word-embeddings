WASHINGTON D. C., June 29, 187. o
Newspapers throughout the country eventuall
speak of the last hours of the last ses- the accid
sion of Congress as disorderly, and ftlcted I
apply even stronger teroms. The ses- tfish occu
sion was not more disorderly than is
usual. Tbat very fair paper, the 1al- .At are
timro Sun, sass, on this point, that Monos sCt
"there was less intoxicaton exhibited (ost nap
than has heretofore been the case in (moitauzl
the closing hours of a session." And " cI'UI
this is undaubtedly time. There was et
confusion, and several Represents- beads ct
tives-all Republicans-were hister- designed
one in their disorder, but on the liet tiil
whole the House did well, and the cliceail
Senate-too. ors ,f 1
The necessity of earlier action on i
appropriation bills was clearly shown, in
as numerous jobs crept at the heel of literall
the session which would have beeTd and hea
summarily killed if they had appear- anst a
ed earlier. They were passed as wore at
amendments to the appropriation e a
bills, and unwilling members voted was a si
for them rather than kill the bills largest
themselves or delay adjournment. An o
Speaker Randall, receired a liberal eland, (
share of curses and blessings by his boys an
determined and successful efforts to habit (
prevent the passage of numerous sub- credital
sidy bills and other expensive meits- their g
urea. Enmity to him on that account noticed
will probably disappear in a great his doo
measure in time, and should he be ly latc
re-elected to the House and desire mined I
again to be Speaker, the great abil- ared
ity he displayed throughout the sea- that Co
sion will make him a formidable can- he fone
didate. in the
I do not wish to intrude advice kegs t
upon readers, but the breaking up of beer a
the session seems a proper time to re- emptie
peat what is a common remark here, which
that an old member is worth mor, worthl
than a new one to the country, his ed, ea(
constituents and his patty. The pol- stale b
icy of renominating men who have steps I
proved honest and efficient is a very evil, c
wise one. The Republican minority one, d
t, House is strong because its
and very many of its rank
oe have been long in Congress
.now all the ways. The Deiiio
cratlc party will be wise if it follows
Rep'lblican tactics in this respect.
