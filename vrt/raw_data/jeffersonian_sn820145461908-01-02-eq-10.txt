ZETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
OF COURSE J. D. DESERVES A SHARE.
Sebastopol, Cal.
Dear Sir: I have received two postals from
your office requesting names, etc. Will send
a few that I know of. I came here but a
year ago from Colorado, where I had received
all your publications heretofore. I can not
do much soliciting, as I am about seventy
seven years old, but occasionally I can say
a word, and I send my Jeffersonians around
some. You seem to receive all the compli
ments, etc., but I think J. D. is worthy of
some of them. For more than twenty years
my platform has been “the initiative and
referendum. ”
With best wishes, I am,
Yours respectfully,
GEO. X. YOUNG.
FROM THE TENTH.
Lincolnton, Ga., Dec. 14, 1907.
Dear Sir: Herewith please find P. 0. order
for $2, for which renew my subscription to
both the Weekly and monthly Jeffersonians
for one year each.
Yours respectfully,
D. G. DANNER.

AN ESTEEMED TEXAS FRIEND.
Mansfield, Tex., Dec. 3, 1907.
Dear Sir: Enclosed please find P. 0. money
order for $2, for which please renew my sub
scription to the Weekly and monthly for one
year.
Respectfully and fraternally vours,

AN ARKANSAS FRIEND.
Hutchinson, Ark., Nov. 27, 1907.
Dear Sir: T received your card of the 11th
inst., as to sample of your magazine. Send
them along 1 , also the Weekly Jeffersonian.
You will find my name in your mailing-list
for the first number. Mv father was a sub
scriber to the People’s Party Paner, a true
Populist, and a lover of T. E. Watson. T
read your paper then, and have some on file
yet. T was a regular subscriber to the New
York Magazine until they put you out, then
she was no good to me. I was in time to get
the first issue of the Jeffersonian and have not
missed a copy yet.
Your “Life and Times of Andrew Jack
son,” running in the Jeffersonian, is worth
the subscription. “Ann Boyd” is simply fine.
But the way you roast those financial rascals
suits me the best.
I have no money and very little education,
but I know some trood things when T see them.
This financial crisis has caught people like
rats in a trap, and they don’t know how it
was done.
Well, now to business. T don’t want to miss
any of the Jeffersonians, so T had better re
new. You will please find enclosed $2, for
the two Jeffersonians. Send them to Hutch
inson, Arkansas, instead of Jamestown, Ar
kansas.
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
Mr. Watson, if you were in Roosevelt’s place
just a little while, I am certain we would get
a few million dollars in treasury notes. Send
samples at any time. I will hand them around.
Wishing you success and a. long life, I am,
Your friend,
R. L. MUSTAIN.
A TRUE BLUE.
Dear Sir: Send me the Jeffersonian another
year. There is nothing in reason that I would
not do for you. I have been sneered at and
slurred for thirty years for the same prin
ciples that you advocate. I made myself ac
quainted with the money question as soon as
I saw the first jpaeenback. If I had the power
to handle our cause like you, I would stir
up the nation.

of happiness, I am,
Sincerely vours,

THIS FROM A MAN WHO WOULD MAKE
A GOOD CONGRESSMAN.
Montgomery, Ala., Dec. 5, 1907.
Dear Sir: As my subscription to both of
your publications will expire on the 26th of
this month, I am enclosing you money order
for $2.50 for renewal for one year. I will get
more solid information from reading one copy
of the Weekly or magazine than I would get
from a year’s subscription to some of the
trust-fed daily papers.
Yours respectfully,
