In the lt4r colony the stricken ones
continually crave meat, always mleat
food. which is the worst diet, from the
medical point of view, that goould h41 al

lr( thirun, usually known inl the i'uited I
States as United Bothrint. Riev. Nil.
and 1"ils. Weiss are now in the United
States, in New York city, hoping and
praying that some of th1 millionaire
Americans who can pay $"10.U0 for an
antique saltcellar or a picture and not
feel it may be moved out of their benev
olent hearts to give a little of their
wealth to alleviate the most awful, sor
rowvful fate which can befall a human
being, that of dying through years of
slow torture by leprosy.
Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Weiss, a devoted
young married pair, refined, highly ed
ucated, appreciating, none more, the
joys and advantages of the choicest
civilization, turned their faces away
from all that seemed to make life
worth living and journeyed to the
plague colony to live or die. as God
willed. In the service of humanity.
Father Damien of Hawaii had nothing
like so much to make him bold life
dear as these two.
Save for two or three Dutch dea
conesses who act as nurses and at
tendants for the lepers. Mr. and Mrs.
Weiss live alone with their colony,
alone among lepers. Their colony in
eludes negroes. Chinese. Jews. Dutch
mulatto halfbreeds and coolies from
ma. wmes. a. m s. wmass.
the faraway Dutch East Indies, such
as Javanese. They willingly give their
lives to their work, but it wrings their
hearts to know they have not means
even to lighten the suffering of the
doomed ones.
Their chief want is for more build
ings, a surgery and bathrooms. The
lepers of the colony live in two groups
of cottages, the women in one group,
men in the other. They are kept very
clean, being bathed and having their
ulcers dressed daily. The abler and
more capable of the victims help in
this work, knowing full well it is only
a question or a little time when they,
too, will become helpless as the weak
eat. It is the strangest ailment, this
leprosy. It may attack a person at
any age, from two years up. Its dura
tion reacheusomtimes thirty years be
fore its victim finally dies. This long
drawn out agony, however. is only in
case the stricken one is of the black,
brown or yellow race. Whites succumb
in about two years. No case is on rec
ord of a leper having been cured since
New Testament times. There is a
remedy known among some of the
Surinam negroes which seems to ef
fect a cure, but sooner or later the dis
ease appears again. Even if relief is
only temporary, medicel science ought
to persist till it finds out what the rem
edy is.
Among the natives of the original In
dian race of the country a leper is
never seen. It is, however, , darkly
hinted that now and then there is such,
but he is put out of life immediately
by the healthy Indians.
In the Dutch government leper set
tlement the patients are. allowed to
marry. Occasionally not often, they
have children, and tliese are usually
free from the diseaV. They are sent
away from the leper colony at the age
of two years. It is said the scourge
attacks in turn their children, however.

of a reverie as to be almost in danger
of losing his way when he was over
taken and accosted by it blithe little
Hebi'ew clothing dealer, who, evidently
not knowing him and his habits of
thought, struck up a friendly, general
sort of conversation.
.'Good efening," he said. "Vas you
a-going to hear Carleton?"
"I was." replied the poet, sadly and
truthfully. "Am I in time to get there
before be begins?"
"Oh, sure! You haf lakesHG l of
time," rejoined the other.st in you
efel heard him?"
"Yes." replied Carleton mournfully.
"Several times."
"Do you know him personal?"
hNot-, eryc well"p repliendly, leto ner
wearily. "Do you ?"
"Sure!" replied the clothing store
t fan. "I ha m had some hot times with
him in New York. He is a high roller
nOw, I tell you. He owes me for a
suit of clothes now, but I do not press
the bill."
"You will never get it." replied Carle
ton.
"Vell, it Is all right if I don't." re
plied the Hebrew. "Ve owe something
to such men. Hat you a seat?"
"Why. no," replied the lecturer. "I
thought it would be easy enough to se
cure one when I got there."
"You will not," replied the other.
"They are all sold. But you seem to
be a good fellow, and you may haf
mine, if you only bay the admission
fee. I know the manager, and he vill
put me somewheres."
The lecturer promised to avail him
self If necessary of the other's gener
osity, and they went in together. It is
said that the Hebrew's face was a
study when he saw his "high roller"
companion throw off his overcoat and
mount the platform.
