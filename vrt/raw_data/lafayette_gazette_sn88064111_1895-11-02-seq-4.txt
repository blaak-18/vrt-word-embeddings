A benefit is always experienced from the t

when the right quantity is taken. a
When the lungs are affected it causes t
shooting pains, like needles passing

P ehltetms at the Staple.
One of the greatest dtrabaecklt to t- X.
proved farming ta eonileotiob with
cotton culttre is the fact that eottDh
doCs not apparently stcceed Wi wi~th t
deep plowlng. It has been found that m
cotton is apt to be later on a deeply
-worked seo. rot fruiting well till thI b
roota strike hard bottom. Ftrom close
observation I am satisfled that this is
more apparent than real, and that m'
while1 the inmmediate preparation of m
the land for the cotton crop it is to M
plow less deeply than for the other a
crops in the rotation, the fact that the t
land has been deeply broken in
previous plowings is no detri
ment, but an advantage to the
cotton crop in increasing the capillar
ity of the soil, and warding off the
effects of drought, the well-settled soil vs
having the same effects on the fruit
ing of the crop that an unbroken soil le
would have and without the disadvan hi
tages attending the real hard pan.
There is no point where greater im- tr
provement is needed in the south than
in the breaking and preparation of the hi
land for crops. With the incoming of ti
the era of farming instead of plant
ing, the one-mule plow should disap- a
pear from the farm except for the pur
pose of marking rows perhaps. As a of
tool for breaking land or for cultivat- ly
lIg crops it should be relegated to tl
the museums of departed tools, along- Is
side the pointed tree limb of ancient
times. It may answer for the stirring o,
of sand that has nothing but sand in ai
it. But in all the upland red clay of cc
the south no tool less effective than a
turning plow drawn by two good Ic
horses should be used for the breaking Ii
of land, and for all crops except cotton ai
a large plow drawn by three mules or fi
horses should be used. For years in k
Virginia I never broke a fleld with a
lighlter team than three mules to tl
a plow, and followed in the same fur- it
row with a subsoil plow drawn by two hi
horses, so as to break the clay fully
a foot, and generally more. All t.
over the red clay lands of the south
men are to-day plowing a little furrow
with a single mule, drawing a plow
that has more resemblance to a child's
play tool than to a real plow for work, Ic
and are working a soil exhausted of
the elements of fertility, while just a
below the point of the tooth-pickc plow a
there lies a virgin soil waiting for the
man with courage and intelligence o
enough to break it and let in the roots
of the peas and clover to unlock the
storehouse of big crops. This is no u
mere theory, for we have done it
right here. The old red clay hill a
on which the North Carolina
college of agriculture was built
was five years ago the most
notoriously poor spot around Raleigh. e
By deep breaking and the use of a lit
tle clover it was brought up to make a
over fifty bushels of corn per acre.
with hardly any manuring. I
While in the deep sandy soils of tile t
coast deep plowing may not be needed,
there is no practice that will more t
rapidly tend towards the improvement
of our clay hills than deep plowing, a
subsoil plowing and shallow cultiva- t
tion. Our farmers have long ago t
learned the value of shallow culture
for the cotton crop, but most of them
still imagine that the corn crop
must be deeply worked, and have
its feeding roots lacerated with a plow.
When I was young and thoughtless
I too worked corn with a plow and
was of the opinion that I must bank
up soil to the rows to keep it from 1
falling down in the winds, not reflect
ing that corn with uninjured roots,
and allowed to plant its brace roots
on a level surface would stand up bet
ter than that which had had its roots
lacerated and destroyed by the plow,
and could get no firm hold for its
brace roots on a sloping bank of earth.
Then too where the oats crop is not
used in the rotation, and it is desired
to follow the corn crop with cotton, 1
this shallow culture is an advantage
in gettis* the soil below firmed for 1
the cotton crop. We do not consider a
it the best policy to have two hoed 1
crops follow each other, when it
can--h avoided, but where peas are 1
sown in the corn, the cotton crop may
well follow it, provided the cotton has
a liberal supply of the potash and
phosphoric acid it needs. Some high
scientific authorities, who never
plowed an acre, have of late been try
ing to show to the farmers that the
best way to grow cotton is to apply
only just so much of a complete fer
Oilizer as the immediate crop can use,
and they call the restoring of the plant
food in the soil, for the future benefit
of the soil. "dealing in futures." Now,
as far as practical farming is con
cerned, there is no business where it is
more profitable and essential to deal
in futures, and the farmer who does
not deal in the future of his soil is
malting a sad mistalke. It is this very
lack of regard for the future of the
land that has brought thie cotton coun
try to the impoverished condition that
aklicts it to-day, and until we come to
take the future condition of our soils
into consideration with every sale crop
Sowe grow, there can be no recal advance
ment in agriculture in the south. Of
all thle measures therefore than tend
to thle development of the real fertili
ty of our clay soils there are none of
more importance than deep plowing,
subsoiling and shallow culture .of the
hoed crops. There is nothing that so
wa-rdR off the badeffects of a drought
as a deeply-broken soil with a shallow
mulch of soil kept constantly mellow
on the snrface.-W. F. Massey, Super
intendent of the North Carolina Ex

THE FARM MORTGAGE.
A Westerna View or It 'I hat Will Apply to
Southern Farmning.
"Some people are getting alarmed at
the amount and extent to which the
country is encumbered with nmort
gages. Thie country is plastered over
with mortgages they say. Mortgage

By means of the mortgage the natural
resources of the country are falling
into the hands of a few capitalists.
If this keeps on where will it end?
and sinrilrr remarks are heard quite
Ifrequently.
What is the nature of a mortgage,
anyhow, that it is such grounds for
alarm? A mortgage is practically aim

About Bees. at
Iook out for robbers when the har- tic
vest becomes scarce. th
When the harvest is plenty you can th
let honeystandaround unprotected for di
half a day.
But woe be to you if you try that kt
trick after the honey flow has ceased. cc
And when robbing commences your A
bees that had seemed so quiet and gen- of
tle become like little demons.
1'11 tell you a trick worth knowing re
about robbers.
If they commence on a comb of honey n
or on a weak colony, and have got fair
ly to work, don't take away what
they're working at and leave nothing
in its place.
If you do, they'll go to hunting all Ia
over to find what has become of it, n(
and like as not pitch on the nearest of
colony and clear it out. w
But leave in its place something that
looks like it, with at least a little at
honey in it, and when they get that yi
all cleaned out they'll leave it satis
fied, thinking they've got all there is
to be had.
If robbers are started on a colony at
that you think might take care of hI
itself with a little help, pile straw or fc
hay around it. pi
Pile it a loot high about the en- al
trance. I
Then pour water on it. i
Drench it good b
Keep pouring on some mote.
The robbers won't stand that very h
long.
But if the colony is queenless and cI
weakl, the robbers will begin work
again as soon an it dries off. o
Better not keep any queeuless col- Y
onies anyhow.
They're not worth fussing with.
Break them up at once and distrib
ute the brood and bees to others.
A weak colony with a good queen o
will be glad of them. !
If you work for extracted honey.
don't extract too close.
Nowadays it isn't considered beat to
extract out of the brood nest.
It pays to leave all in the brood nest,
and perhaps a little beside.
Unless the combs are crammed very
full the bees may starve before that '
time. c
Tl'hey'll not waste-it if they have more n
than they need. -
' The only possible danger is that there
may be so much honey in the brood F
- nest that there isn't room for the queen
to lay.

get the government to have apis dor- a

Hens as Weed Destroyers.
t If a hen and chicks are placed in a I
d yard or confined on a small plot, every
, blade of grass, as well as every weed,
e will be destroyed, and in a few days

After the second shock I took warning, or, thi
in all probability, a third would carry me
off.
