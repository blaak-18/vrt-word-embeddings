Ed
people's Vindicator :
The tax payers of this parish are de
perhaps not aware of the attempted "L
yerpetration ofa grand and lofty swin- no
die upon the m; and although the ha
(indicator has called attention to it we
some year since, it may not be amiss thi
to make mention of it now. a (
During the regime of Prince 1onllt, int
in that era of fraud, the like of which
was never before known, his eye fell
upon certain property BELONGING TO diE
HE PARISH which lie regarded, as on
sil other property to which the pub- bu
lie had claim, as legitimate prey for pl
the ring, and he assessed the same w
upon the tax roll as the property of in
parties non-resident and u'zknotln. in,
This property, of course, was sold at t
tax sale and the proceeds went, God
knows where. At all events, there its
was, and is a spasmodic attempt on iti
the part of this reformed (1) Police m
Jury now holding, to be honest and of
do honestly. This attempt, tho doubt,
is a virtuous necessity brought about at
by the dim vision, either in the past f
or prospective, of grass rope and shot et
gone; but be that as it may, they b3
should be encouraged in a good thing
and deserve the support of the tax
payers in such laudable undertakings.
This property, of which I speak, is,
or was about to be returned to its at
owner, the people, when those gnar
dilns of "our client's honors" seeing,
no, doubt, a "huge hole" for litiga
tion, have manfully closed the breach
with a writ of injunction. Stopping
only to inquire if a party may not
become a party to a fraud after the a
fact as well as before, the good cit
izeas would like to know what is the e
meaning of those "call meeting reso
lotions" of the Police Jury f Does
the Police J.ury imagine for an in
stant that a body of its oieighty trisdom
ca.n throw dust in the eyes of any in
telligent person in this parish t If
they do, they are most wofully mis
taken I
The points in this case are a little
too plain to be befuddled by any "le
gal technicalities." 1st. The property
belonged to the parish. 2d. Every
man who has had anything to do with
public matters here knors that fact. t
13d. The tax assessor knew it, and U
knew furthermore that no public prop
eryj is sulject to taxation ! The as
seessment was a fraud ; the sale was a
frad d; and the parties purchasing
never did, nor never will have a title
to the property !
&o talk qf compromise, and I
would like to. fquire what the par
ish has to compromise in this matter ?
I write this to give our people fair
warning of ni "abortion at reform"
attempted by the Police Jury, aided
anrd assisted by "ontsiders". The
Parish will be swindled out of the lots
claimed unless a strong expression of
public opinion is brought to bear.
'ile truckling is apparent. First, the
1olice Jury adcopts a se:ies of resulu
Stish to the point; resolutiouns wbhich
will force thie return of. the property
to its lawshl t.aid ) ony owners, and
apoin the moment of vlctdfy it calls
a meeting, places the settlement of the
matter id' te hainds ot its President,
wh is no more competent -tha s
male, divtest the Parish Attorney
who is'competent, and at once lays
epen the parishi to the lose of. its
preperty. Ir other rostd Eonniveist

'They not only see the Polce Jury's
atlon, but thelbmnd of others is pain

]"What thieeople will require is a

Editor People's Vindicator :
In strolling o'er tle ruills of the
departed Post Office, I find that
"Langford, Lessee," has seen fit to
notice the fact that certain parties3
have thought that their dispatches
were being read by other parties and
this notice taken in connection with
a conversation le had with a prom
inent gentleman of your city, during
which he stated "that a party had
said he *ould never send another
dispatch as long as the telegraph I
office remained in the Vindientor
building," would lead us cornntry peo
ple to suppose that the Vindicator
was the sufferng party to this unjust
imputation. I am led to make these
inquiries with pointed regard to this
telegraph line.
Is there a radical dollar invested in
its construction ? And does it derive
its support from the radical party
mainly 7 That it should remove the
office at the diction of a party who did
not admire the Vindicatot. I do not
stop to answer the point in Mr. Lang
ford's removal, which is, that parties
connected with the Vindicator have
been guilty of tampering with the tel
egraph otflce. The parties connected
with it now, and in the past, are too
well known, and Mr. Langford too
much of a stranger to admit of sutch
an imputation standing. -
The whole matter looks as If "Lang
ford, Lessee, was running this tele
graph at the diction of the radicals of
this city, which would at once make
it a matter of scrutiny to those, whose
money aided in constructing the line,
and who pay 95 per cent of its in
come.

ISSUEI) MO.YTHL1 .
"A .Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
carried out."
Thei ncessity of a popular nlediunm for
the representation of the productioins of el,
our great artists, has always been recog
nized, and lriiny attempts have biten
imadell, to mIlct. the want,. The snece',(ssive
fthilures which so invaribly tollowed e: ':h
attempt in this coiuntry to establish anll 1
art journal, did not prove the inelithfer
once of the people of Aliei'ica to the
claims of high art. So soon as a proper Io
appreciation of the wahit and an albility
to meet it were shown, the public atll
once rallied with entlhusiasln to its snal
plort. and the result was a rteat artistic
and conunercvial triumph-TlHE;ALl 1N E.
THIIE ALDINE, while lsslieetd ith all the
regularity. has none of the temporary or
timely interest chllarcteristic of ordinary ce
pert"ldicals. It is an elegant miscellany
of pure, light and gracefull literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci
nens of artistic skill, in black anld white.
Although each succeeding number affords
a fresh pleansuire to. its friends, the real
value and beauty of the ALDImNE will be
most appreeiatedi after it has been bonld
ipl at the close of the year. While other
journals may claim superior cheapness, as
compared with r.,als df a similar clalss,
the ALIIEx is a uniqle and original con
ception-alone' and unapproached-also- 41
Intely without eolmpetition in price or D
clharacter. The possessor of ai complete

shape or nulnmber of v-OlineIs for tenl times Ii
its cost; and then, there is the Chrolno in
besides! at
National feature of 'Til; ALDINE
must be taken in no narrow Sense. 1''ri li
art is cosmopolitan. While THE Al. m
DINE is a strictly American institution.
it does not coltilne itself entirely to thli t(
ireproductioi of native art. Its mission iv
0 is to cultivate a broad and aplpreciative it
O art taste, one that will discriminate eeolll
on groinds of intrinsic muerit. 'l'ins te
p while placing before tle .patrons of T'ill
o ALDINE, as ia leading charaeteritie, the P
productioiis i the nikst noted American
artists, attention will ilways ihe given to
specimens i'l il tlforeign masters, giving
snbscrith~is all the pleasmure and instruc
tion tiltaiulble from home or foreign A
sources.
'he artistic illustration. of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magnificent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can be afforded by any inferior
page. The judiciolk. ientetspersion of
landscalie, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, shtildin an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. I'he literature of THE
ALDIlE is a light and graceful accoln
panimeiflt, wdithy of the artistic fea
tures, with nuly such techliical disqerisi
tioes as do fiit intbrfere with the popu
lar intereit of the work.
