How a Harriman Lawyer Did a
Good Thing, as Cabinet Officer,
for the Harriman Interests
At one time the contract said that
the Panama Railroad would not is
sue through bills of lading for any
other company doing business on the
Pacific north of Panama. That was
stopped when the American Govern
ment came in possession of the rail
road, as was the old custom by which
the transcontinental railroads paid
the Panama railroad a million dol
lars a year to let the Southern Pa
cific and its associate lines make all
the through rates for the business
sent byway of Panama. The intro
duction of a bill to establish a line
of Government steamers from the
Panama railroad to ports on the
Pacific coast brought an inquiry in
the course of which the Senate com
mittee learned that since the man
agement of the Panama railroad and
connecting steamship lines fell into
the hands of Mr. Dickinson the di
vision of proceeds had been changed
to 30 per cent, for the Government
and 70 per cent, for the Pacific Mail
Steamship Line. The Pacific Mail is
a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific
Railroad.
When E. A. Drake was called be
fore the committee to explain how
the change had been made, he said
that the Pacific Mail Company said
they were losing money on the busi
ness on the old basis, and would
quit unless given a larger share of
the receipts for the long haul. To
keep the company from quitting the
Government had given the Harriman
company 70 per cent, of the receipts
and remitted a former charge of 90
cents a ton for dockage at Panama.
“Did you try to get some other in
terests to take up the business if the
Pacific Mail people abandoned it?”
Bristow asked.
“Yes,” said Drake. “I discussed
it with several ship owners and ex
perts, but no one took it up.”
Questioned further he named,
among others, G. N. Baker, of Balti
more, former president of the At
lantic Transport Line, an expert in
marine matters and a capitalist.
This afternoon Mr. Baker drifted in
to the committee meeting, and Bris
tow called him to the stand as a wit
ness. Baker said he had been con
sulted about the matter, and had
talked it over with the Secretary of
War.
“Could you have made money on
half the present rate from New York
to San Francisco?” Bristow asked.
“I think so.”
“Why did not you try it?”
“I made a proposition to the Sec
retary of War that if the Govern
ment would give me the same rates
for carrying the mails as other
steamship companies have I would
arrange to put fifteen modern ships
in the Pacific coast trade and estab
lish a regular service between Pana
ma and the cities along the Pacific
coast.”
Bristow—“What did the Secretary
of war say?”
Baker—“He said it was his prov
ince to build the canal, nor to estab
lish new steamship lines.”
Bristow—“Do I understand you
correctly? You simply proposed that
the Government make the same con
tract with you for carrying the mails
that it makes with other steamship

Bristow —“Then the refusal of the

Baker —“It looked that way to
me.” *
Another witness, whose testimony
has some importance, was George S.
Dearborn, of New York, president of
the American Hawaiian Steamship
Company. His company has steam
ers that carry freight to the western
end of the Tehuantepec Railroad of
Mexico, owned by the Mexican Gov
ernment, and the California ports
served by the Pacific Mail steamers.
Dearborn's company pays dock
charges and turns its freight over to
the Mexican railroad for one-third
of the rate from San Francisco to
New York.
Senator Bristow returned to the
attack on the Pacific Mail Steamship
contracts in the Senate committee on
inter-oceanic canals this afternoon.
At a morning session he had develop
ed some important facts, and this af
ternoon Bristow assumed the role of
questioner and asked the witnesses
about contracts and other things that
brought out some facts that may call
for an explanation from the Secre
tary of War, Jacob M. Dickinson.
Mr. Dickinson came to the Cabinet
from the position of general counsel
of the Illlinois Central Railway, a
Harriman line, ami Bristow, in his
questions, indicated a suspicion that
perhaps the Secretary of War had
spent so much of his life in the rail
road business that he might have a
feeling of friendship for Harriman
railroads that is not shared by the
people generally. It had been shown
that for a generation nearly, during
the time the French owned the canal
and the Panama railroad, there had
been a division between the Panama
railroad and the connecting steam
ship line to New York, on the one
side, and the Pacific Mail Company
on the other, on the basis of each
side receiving 50 per cent, of the
charges for freight hauled between
New York and San Francisco.
Dearborn told the committee that
his company is making money on
33 1-3 per cent, of the through rate,
and is increasing its business steadi
ly. Bristow is familiar with the mat
ter in controversy, having made a
special investigation of it during the
Roosevelt administration. He be
lieves that the present arrangement
is helping the transcontinental rail
roads to keep their freight rates high
and will keep after this question un
til he has found the whole history of
the system, and found also if it is
possible to apply any fair and rea
sonable remedy through action by
Congress.
Mr. Watson and Mr. Ellis
Having printed the gist of Mr.
Watson’s opposition to Foreign Mis
sions in following out its policy of
giving both sides a hearing, we guess
Obe 3fttk rsotlio
that it is up to this paper to print
Mr. Ellis’ side of the story.
This Mr. Ellis seems to be very
much rankled because Mr. Watson
refused to waste his time and am
munition in debating the subject of
Foreign Missions with him, alleging
that he was too obscure.
He may be ever so well known to
others, but we confess that this is
our first introduction to this Mr. El
lis. But we may be in the same boat
as the old negro was whom we once
tried to persuade to vofe for Mr.
Greeley. His reply was:
“Mr. Harris, eb’rybody in de whole
world done hear ob General Grant,
but who eber heard of Mr. Greeley?”
Mr. Ellis says that Mr. Watson is
so little known in the North that
some of Mr. Ellis’s friends thought
him the man who wrote “The Ser
pent’s Tongue.”
Seems to us that this does not
speak well for Mr. Ellis nor his
friends.
Mr. Watson was Vice-President on
the ticket with Mr. Bryan in 1896.
He was the nominee of the Populist
party in 1900, in 1904, and again in
1908. He was a member of Congress
from Georgia and was the author of
our free rural delivery system. He
has written a history of Thomas Jef
ferson, a history of Andrew Jackson,
a history of Napoleon and a history
of France, and his history of France
is so much better than any other his
tory of the kind that has ever been
written that its excellence has been
acknowledged by the French Gov
ernment.
These things being the facts, it
seems to us for one to say that he
does not know this man is to adver
tise his own ignorance.
This Mr. Ellis makes the state
ment that Mr. Watson was ungrate
ful, for he was himself educated at
a mission school, and should be the
last to say aught against missions.
That is the very gist, the very soul,
of Mr. Watson’s argument. His con
tention is that this money we are
sending away from home to educate
the “stranger’s child” should be
kept at home to educate our own de
serving poor—our kith and kin.
Mr. Ellis charges that Mr. Watson
is guilty of a base slander for say
ing that Elsie Siegel was a foreign
missionary, and Mr. Ellis proves
from the records of the departments
at Washington that this unfortunate
young woman was never a mission
ary, so he proceeds to denounce and
demolish the Georgia editor as a
base calumniator.
But Mr. Watson is too careful a
writer to be caught in any such man
ner. Mr. Watson quoted Missionary
Bach in saying that there “were El
sie Siegel cases in the foreign field,”
which is an entirely different propo
sition.
Mr. Watson may be wrong on a
great many propositions. Who of us
is not? But no one ever before ac
cused Mr. Watson with not being
sincere. His public and his private
life are without a stain. By his un
aided efforts, stimulated only by a
laudable ambition, he has arisen to
the first rank as an author and pub
lic debater, and his fame is secure,
yet Mr. Ellis comes down to Mr.
Watson’s own State and before a cul
tivated audience of his own people
denounces him as a blatherskite,
wanting in intelligence and learning,
even going so far as to say that he is
neither a “gentleman, scholar nor
Christian.”
All of which shows the caliber of
the man, the general misfit of his
make-up; but what surprises us is
that the utterances of this ruffian
were applauded in a refined Georgia
audience. —Daily Banner, Ocala, Fla.

A CERTAIN CURE

Wil :
In this day of specialists when
every man makes a specialty of some
subject, it is naturally evident to the
lay mind that a Cancer, Blood and
Dropsy Specialist is a man that has
made a specialty of these subjects.
If you are a sufferer of Cancer,
Dropsy or any diseases of the blood
you would not consult an oculist
would you? Then, if you are afflict
ed with any of these dreaded dis
eases, why not consult a man whose
remedy first cured himself, and was *
then offered to the world? This
remedy is manufactured and sold by
