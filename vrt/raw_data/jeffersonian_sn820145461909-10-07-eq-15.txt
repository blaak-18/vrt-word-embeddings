which we give entire, so that our
readers may see what a fine, courte
ous tone he imparts to his corre
spondence:
“Wouldn’t it be just as well for
you to give your readers correct in
formation?’’
With this letter there were the
note clipped from the Circular and
some reports of chemical analyses of
Cocoa-Cola.
Our reply to Mr. Dobbs follows:
“Your note of the 15th instant,
addressed to Mr. Allison, as well as
various enclosures, has just been re
ceived, and in reply to your query,
‘Wouldn’t it be just as well for you
to give your readers correct infor
mation,’ we would say that to do
this very thing is our constant en
deavor and wd welcome aid from
every source. If by your query you
mean to intimate that the clipping
from the Druggists’ Circular which
you enclosed gives incorrect infor
mation, we would be glad to have
> you specify wherein this information
\ is incorrect.
“We have again compared the fig-
• ures given in the clipping with those
contained in the brief of your attor
ney in the case of H. A. Ruck
er, collector, vs. the Coca-Cola Com
pany, and do not see that we have
misquoted the brief except as to al
cohol, we saying that it is present to
the extent of one per cent., whereas
the brief admits it is present only to
1 the extent of one-half of one per cent.
/ “This error was made in copying the
l figures from a previous number of the
Circular in which one-half of one per
» cent, was correctly quoted. We take
\it, however, that this slight error is
( /not of sufficient importance to call
forth your letter. Furthermore, in
omparing the information we gave
vith the reports of the chemists,
I vhich you enclosed, we fail to find
I therein our note is incorrect. We
f re returning the clipping herewith
nd would appreciate it if you would
lecify exactly what is wrong with it
.40 that we may, in our next issue,
► give our readers ‘correct’ informa
•, tion.”
So far, Mr. Dobbs has not availed
I himself of our offer, which to us
• seems to be almost fairness personi
/ fled, but contents himself —accord-
\ ing to reports which reach us—by
making false statements concerning
us behind our backs, which he hasn’t
the hardihood to put into writing
over his signature.
Although Mr. Dobbs did not an
swer our letter, he did call on us,
and, after a pleasant interview, went
away leaving us under the impres
sion that he was going to grasp the
opportunity which we had given
him, and again gave him, to
point out wherein our information
was incorrect, but this he has not
yet done. Mr. Dobbs has also sent
some of his young men to us bearing
printed reports of chemists’ analyses
of Coca-Cola, but he has never point
ed out wherein our published note
is not “correct.” Indeed, the ad
missions which Mrs. Allen reports in
her letter that he made to her would
confirm the truth of what the Coca-
Cola lawyer stated in court —if any
confirmation were necessary.
The foregoing references include
all that we have been able to find
about Coca-Cola in the Circular, ex
cept one that appears in the June
issue, page 421, in reply to a query
from a subscriber, in which we give
-- • ; -
the gist of what appeared in the at
torney’s brief. In conclusion we
say—
1. That any statement to the ef
fect that we are “down on” Coca-Cola
is not substantiated by the records,
although we are forced to admit that
during its fifty-one years of existence
the Circular has consistently taken
its position on the side of humanity
in all questions concerning habit
forming or dangerous drugs, or other
matters, which have been discussed
in its columns.
2. That any statement to the ef
fect that we have promised to “let
up on” anything or anybody for
the sake of an advertisement is un
qualifiedly false. On the contrary,
our policy is as set forth editorially
in the Circular for June, page 399,
in an article entitled, “Our Readers,
Our Advertisers, Ourselves,” in the
following language: “We try not to
be uncharitable to any one, even to
the ethical outcasts. However, if in
the performance of what we regard
as our duty we happen to say some
thing which an advertiser thinks is
opposed to his best interests, we can
only state that we are sorry for the
advertiser, but can not allow his self
ishness to prevent us from serving
our subscribers the best we know
how.” And we treat non-advertis
ers in the same way.—Editor the
Druggists’ Circular.)
In a pamphlet just issued, Mrs.
Allen says:
For several years the Bureau of
Chemistry at Washington has been
investigating the many “soft” drinks
offered to the public at soda-foun
tains, fruit-stands and other places.
The investigations reveal the fact
that over one hundred of these bev
erages are made up with drugs which
are injurious to health, such as caf
feine and cocaine.
Caffeine .is a drug much used in
headache remedies. It is derived
from the kola nut, and from tea and
coffee. It is also made artificially
from uric acid occurring in the
guano or bird manure deposits of
South America. This bird manure
product is said to be used in some
of the drinks, while in others caffeine
obtained from refuse tea sweepings
is used. The sales manager of the
Coca-Cola Company says the caffeine
in their product is made from tea.
It is claimed by the manufacturers
of caffeine drinks that they are as
harmless as tea or coffee. But phy
sicians advise against the use of tea
and coffee for children and for deli
cate, nervous people, and every in
telligent person knows that these
drinks should not be indulged in im
moderately. The secret caffeine
drinks at soda-fountains are not
warned against because few people
know of what they are made. So it
frequently happens that children
whose parents do not permit them
to drink tea and coffee are taking
caffeine in a much more injurious
form at the drug stores.
Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, Chief of the
Bureau of Chemistry, says: “When
caffeine is separated from tea and
coffee, and used as a separate drug,
it exerts a much more specific action
upon the system than when in natu
ral combination. Its general effect
is to induce that unhappy state de
scribed as nervousness, with derang
ed digestion and impaired health.”
Dr. H. H. Rusby, dean of the Col
lege of Pharmacy of Columbia Uni-
Heffersonlan
versity, New York City, a high au
thority, says: “Caffeine is a genu
ine poison, both acute and chronic.
Taken in the form of a beverage it
tends to the formation of a drug
habit, quite as characteristic, though
not so effective, as ordinary narcot
ics. Permanent disorders of the
cardiac function, and of the cerebral
circulation, result from its contin
ued use.”
The report of the government
chemists is published in one of the
volumes of the President’s Home
Commission. It says: “Attention is
directed to the danger of soft drinks
containing caffeine, and extract of
coca leaf, the active principle of the
latter being cocaine. * * * We have
seen how the opium habit may be
acquired by the use of the various
proprietary or secret preparations,
and so the cocaine habit may be
developed by the use of these much
lauded soft drinks. * * * No wonder
that insanity and diseases of the nerv
ous system are on the increase.”
Os the most widely advertised of
these drinks, Coca-Cola, the report
says: “The prevalence of the ‘Coca-
Cola’ fiend is becoming a matter of
great importance and concern.”
The report of the government
chemists states that drug drinks
originated in the South in the eight
ies, and that the greatest demand
for such drinks is still in the South.
“People of all classes, young and old,
delicate women, and even little chil
dren, consume these,beverages indis
criminately, and no warning is ever
given of the baneful effect of the
powerful habit-forming drugs con
cealed therein.” The report says,
also: “It is well known that some of
these products are mixed under the
most unsanitary conditions. The su
gar, water and drug material will be
dumped into a pot standing in the
cellar of some low building or even
in a stable, where the ceiling is cov-

Drop us a card, and we will put
you on to something, with which you
can turn your neighbors green with
envy, by catching dead loads of fish,
where they have become disgusted
trying to catch them in the old
fashioned way. It is inexpensive,
and will only cost you a postal card
to find out what we say is true. Now
is the season for all varieties of cat
fish and suckers, and with our meth
od you can easily catch all you want,
and some to sell or give away.

ered with dust, cobwebs and dirt of
all descriptions and the floor littered
with filth. The steam from the boil
ing kettle, condensing on the ceiling,
collects the dirt in the drops of wa
ter, and this soon falls back into the
mixture. Again, the syrup will boil
over upon the floor, and a sticky
mass remains which soon collects
straw and filth of all descriptions,
and becomes a rendezvous for flies
and other vermin, for usually no at
tempt is made to clean it up.”
As cocaine is the most destructive
drug known to humanity its presence
in so-called temperance drinks is a
frightful evil calling for speedy leg
islation. It is practically impossible
to cure q person of the cocaine habit.
This drug causes insomnia, dyspep
sia, chonic palpitations, and com
plete paralysis of will-power, with a
tendency to criminal acts. When a
person becomes habituated to its use
he suffers torments when not under
its influence. The real cocaine fiend
will rob or kill to get the drug.
What can be thought of men who,
knowing the deadly nature of this
drug, will hide it away in a drink
sold as harmless to children and
women who would never touch beer
or wines? It is placed in the drink
to form a craving for that drink and
thus create a demand that will en
rich the conscienceless manufactur
ers.
In this connection it may be of in
terest to know that the condition of
many soda-fountains is very unsani
tary; indeed, public inspection of
fountains may yet be called for as a
means of prevention of disease.
Careless clerks also rarely wash the
glasses in which soda-water is served;
the glasses are rinsed only. It is un
fortunate that druggists should make
the soda-fountain a peril; for if kept
sanitary and free from dangerous
drinks it would be a great help in
the fight against the saloon.
