WILD OATS.
PROSI'PECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion ' Amcrician Comic Piper ! t
Illustrated by a carps oftlhe best Ameri
c:an artists, andl cootriblntd to by the
most popular humiorists and satirists of
thie day.
Vit Oats now enters sutccssfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has Ieroiem the established hliumlorous aL1d
satirical paper of the country. It was
started andi continued the first year as a
monthlly, then, to satislfy the deull'anild of
the pullic, it was changedil to a fortlnight.
ly. Still continuing its guood work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up 1
the political and social shams by its c
masterly cartoons andi pungent editorials,
it aclhieved even greater success thanl
before, and was recognized as thl ablest
ani"d Ibrighltcst of its class. Since then we
have viecled still further to the public
dem:ud, and now publslias Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
piresent shape on its intriisic merl'its, hii'
ilug the first shtccissftil weekly humorous
'luaper ever'pnblished in this i ountry.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish' illustratious for W\ild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thoma:s Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, W\\'olf, .Ju , Keettels,
Stckharlt, Day, y, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fanie.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, standl alone and
:unaplp:roachlable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
anl character writers in the United
States ; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original andm pointed.
Wihl Oats will be first-class in every
particular, andt on this aeciounlt may be
taken into the hbest families withoun fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidlios.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
thercfrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEG A rc,\ ITr
TrEis "' Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the re narkablo qualities of YIs
EGAR IliTTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WaLR
ER'S V INEAR IaITTERS are A perient. 1)ia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa

Sudorilic, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

Drevalent in the valleys of our g~eat
ri-ers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, 'Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo

Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, throught
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remnarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WVALKEl-s VINEGAR
BIT'I'Rs, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the samte time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy fl'uc
tions of the digestive organs.

lurking in the system of so malny thou

Forfieal 0se Coiplaints, in young

that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
