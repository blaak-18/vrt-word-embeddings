J. O. Bagwell, President,
Bagwell Business College,
Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: —In answer to your in
quiry in regard to Master Charley
Hathaway, will say that I consider
his work remarkable for a boy of
his age and time spent in business
college. Judging from his speed in
writing and the ease and accuracy
by which he reads his notes, the
system of shorthand he writes must
be very easy to learn for one so
young to have accomplished as
much in so short a time.
Very truly yours,
SOUTHERN SCHOOLS OF CORRE
SPONDENCE.

Slater Lee and Miss Needham at
“Hickory Hill,” the palatial home of
Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
A number of invitations were is
sued for the occasion, and eighty
guests were present to enjoy the
evening.
The receiving party stood in the
parlor, where the guests were after
wards presented to Hon. and Mrs.
Watson.
Profuse decorations, consisting of
red hearts strung on gold and silver
tinsel, red carnations and smilax,
were effectively used in the parlor,
music room, hall and dining room.
They were intermnigled with scores
of red and white electric bulbs which
added much to the brilliancy of the
scene.
Fruit punch was served by Misses
Lucile Ware, Willie Belle Martin and
Ada Hawes in the dining room. Here
and there were scattered dainty cut
glass dishes filled with bon-bons and
salted almonds.
The amusement of the evening con
sisted of the matching of divided red
Valentine cards. The partners of
each one having been found in this
manner. This having been accom
plished the object was the writing of
a Valentine verse to each one’s part
ner. At the completion of this the
verses were read alond before the as
semblage by the one to whom the
verse was addressed.
Prizes were then awarded those
whose verses were considered first
and second best. The first ladies’
prize, a cut glass dish, was awarded
to Miss Marion Gross, the sec
ond, to Miss Erin O’Neal. The
first gentleman’s prize, a silver match
safe, went to Mr. E. D. Borders, the

After this refreshments of hot cof
fee and sandwiches were served in i
the breakfast room adjoining the
dining room.
Delicious pink ice cream, molded
in the shape of cupids, with pink and
white heart-shaped cakes, were af
terwards served.

were varied, many were beautiful,

originality and thought.
