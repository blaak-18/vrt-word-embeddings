The Indian War.
The neath and defeat of Custer at
the iandRs if Sitting Bull have pro
iITced an important change in the In
"inn policy of the Government, which
-n to tlihe present time has consisted
of a ting series of broken promises
uand iiolated treaties. With the past,
however, we have nothing at this
uncture to do. What we have to do
with just now is the present, and the
future, which the presents foreshid
OwS.
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs
telegraphed on Satnadav the Indian
agents at Red Cloud and Sp6tted Tail
to transfer their charges to the mil
itary officers at Camp IRobinsoa and
Sheridan respectively. Such an or.
ler a few year% ago would, iT made
general, have rsuited in a very dif
ferent state Of afaiirs from what ex
ists at this tine. The Indians have
always entertained a profound respect
for the word of an officer of the army,
and the promisees made by the
military to them have ever been re
ceived as reliable. A knowledge of
this fact has caused more than one at
tempt to be made to have the mahi
agement of Indian affairs plated un
der the control of the Secretary of
War, but the attemps have been madd
iu vain, until now wIhen, 'aggravated
past all endarance, Sitting tall withl
what watriots bb can gather around
his Standard has resolved to tight to
the bitter end. If he has half the as
t-uteness with which he is creditedi he
ibust be *ell aware of what the final
result will be, and, kdowiug this, be
can have but one object in view, and
that is to destroy as many ot his one
thies as podlible tefOre e yields to
the inevitable and dies with his face
to the foe.
That the struggle will be long and
.bitter, therecan be no doubt. The
unnc pretoutinsant idea- that a reg
iment of cavalry coild ride rough
shed over the country of the Sijoux
has at last been reluctantly abandoid
ed. No one apparently appreciates
the actual state of affairs more thor
Iibghly than Geno Crook, da he vainta
all the men lie can get before making
sn aggressi'b hiotement, and when
hie assumes the offensive ie ie rdy coii
Bdently expect some very hard
knoeks. Meanwhile it may reason
ably be supposed that Sitting Bull is
not idle, and his present apparent i.-
nactivty will justify the suspicion
,that bi will be ready to strike when
the time tmes. Indians seldom at
e tack a wtCl protected WuOAl, which
fact may explain Crook's immunity
from attack. Muot stress has bee
laid on the damage bhich would e-
sue to Crook by the burning of the
gess, but it most be remembered
that hle Indians depend on the grass
for feeding their ponies, and when the
prairie is onte:Bred thlie is no tel
liiA hos mach country may be burn
ad over. At this gai the Indians
would be the greatest arsb rers. The
ehiefdifialtyesperienced by the In
dians wilt be in providiun food for a
large ·number of men, any. length of
time. The bliffalo has beep rendered
scarce sad timid by reckles s-anglit
et, and the Yellow Stone region it
