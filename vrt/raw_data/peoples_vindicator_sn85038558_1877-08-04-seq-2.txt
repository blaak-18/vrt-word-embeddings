The End of Civil Law.
There is onle ld lfeatuire in tihese Mel
Northern railroad riots, which
ion,
have been quite genelr;tl in that thi,
''larw abidi j(?) sf'tiol for days
past, and that onee bad feature is i,.
the unconstitutional call for, and tlio
use of the United States army. tita
Although the strikes were wide t"rO
spread along the line of railroads, I hi
they were simplnly local distm'urha; - v
hns
ee. which did not call for ail ex- lil
asperating exhiiition of armed n li
State Militia even. The conflict l)ei
to a certain point, was one be- a
tween employers and employees, ot
condulcted by muioral force on citli- ain
er side. The railroad magnates, "w
as usual, were beaten in the con
test, and appealed to the State On
authorities for help. t111
And ftir what purpose ?
To re-enforce themselves with
the physical power of' the ('om- r
non wealths in order to intimuidat e
and over-awe their star' ing em- ti
ployees into obledience of a man- Ii
date they claimed would starve go
them and their families CO
These Governors swiftly answer- S:
ed the call of their Kings, and a
the spectacle was presented of r
the civil at;ihorities being the fo- I
mentors Jf riot and tumult; for er
we ,nrnteI.1, and a study of the i
incidents ill show that all the
blood-shed was caused by the i)
foolish display of the State sol. r
diers-ai: ye sore and a mcnace ar
to any people horn of American S(
patriots.
As might have. been expected, V
these regiments of "ycomaii in
fattry" served but to exasperate q'
and madden, while a simple mag- t0
cstrate would have peacefully cr
quieted the disturbance, and pro- .t
tected, as well as settled, the St
rights of all, lawfully and legally. '.
Even after the failure of tile
idiotic "militia policy" of the tl
Governors, why did they not re- t
sort to those peaceful measures IF
which from the first, would have if
saved trouble and blood-shed ? st
Then camie the demand for g
United States troops by the Gov- v,
ernors of several of these States, nI
and then to prompt furnishing of tl
them by the President.
The Constitution provides, that
in case of "invasion or domestic fi
violence," the Governors can call
for United States troops. A imob c
is not, nor can it ever be constru- I
ed into "domestic \violence," and I
this "domestic violence" mllust be
equal to an "invasion." It must
be more than a mob); it must Ibe
more than an attack on a "freight
(1depl)ot," or a "ron0 d house," or a
hundred of themn for that mllatter',
for the only "dlomestic violence" I
contempl)lated by the Constitution I
is, an armed aindtl organized at
tack upon the lpnter and authori
ty of the State gou'rftent, with a
view to its orerthrow and distrue
tion. D)id the rioters at lIalti
more, at Pittsburg, at Chicnago,
contemplate the distruction ot the
autononmyof the State of M3aryland,
Pennsylvania; or Illinoise f Cer
tairrly not.
These outbreaks, when they
eren rose to the Ilmaglnitude of ri
ots, were simply local disturban
ces which it was tlhe duty, as it
certainly was within the power of
the State authorities to suppress.
The contirmned called upon the
(G;overnment for troops to police
States is at variance with repuli
can ideas, and must stop. There
has been too mudch of it of late
years, and we must believe, that
when a riot assumes such propor
tions as that tile entire State au
thorities and power canlnot sup
press, there is somethinig behind,
which all thle armies of the Union
cannot correct, though they may
diserse it.
iitrier the eltd of civil go\verIn
mnct in the States of this Union
has b.ce reahede, or else this
exhibition o' the lUnitedt States
iarmy as Stato police, is an otrage
niot to be strianitted to in silence.
A Mr. Morris, pliaoter, near St. Jo
seph, Tensas Parish, La., accidentally
Siscovered what lhe.calls ai cli ap and
cffective means of destroyimg the co
con grass. It is to sprinkle coal oil
(that in its crude state is best), on time
grass out of aim ordinary watering pot
putting it on so that about five or
tix drops will be on each stem that
goes down to the outs in thle ground'.
'rlhe'best time to. put it on is when the
grass is perfectyir dry, free fromt rain
water and dew. WilU some one try
