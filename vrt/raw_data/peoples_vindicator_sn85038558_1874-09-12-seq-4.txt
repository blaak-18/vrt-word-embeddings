Ayer's
Hair Vigor
Por restoring to Gray Hair its
natural Vitality and Color.
A dressing
which is at
once ,gree8
ble, healithy,
and effectual
for preserv
ing the hair.
It soon re
stores faded
or gray hair
to its original
color, with the gloss asnd freshness of
youth. Thin hair is thickened, fhIl
ing hair checked, and baldness often,
though not always, cured by its
use. Nothing can restore the hair.
where the follicles are dcstroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the hair with a pasty sediment, it
wil ,seep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional ase will prevent the hair
from turning gray or falling off,
and consequently preven t Ialdness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of d:adruff, which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
Free from those deleterious sub
stances which make some prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
not harm it. If wanted merely for
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing else
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giiang it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.

which change, when reckoned on the vast

Grateful Thousands proclaim
VINEGAR rrITTERS the most wonder
ful luvigorant that ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person can take these Bit
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other meams, and vital or
gans wasted beyond repair.
Bilious, temittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Ark uan.s, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio 1Grando, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so dupring seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerfill iniluence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DI. J. \VALKEI'S VINEGAR
BITTERrs, as they will speedily remove
the dark- colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy funo
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
VIEGAR BITTERs. No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus fore-armed.

Tightness of the Chest, Dizziness, Sour
Eructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste
in the Mouth, Bilious Attacks, Palpita

Lungs, Pain in the region of the Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are the offsprings of l)yspepsia. One bot

merits than a lengthy advertisement.

Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affelc

Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, WALKER'S VIs
EOARIinTTERS have shown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable eases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit

of the Blood; Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diasases.-Persons

dug up and carried owt of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Trape, and other Wons,
lurking in the system of so many thon
sands, amre effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelminities will freo the
system from worms like these Bittern.
ForFemaleComplaints, in young
or old, married or single, tathe dawn of
womanhood, orthe turn of life, theseTon
ie Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soood perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever youlind iti impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you findit ob
structed and sluggishlin the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
yon when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
