FRIDAY, May sg, 1896. c]
The "reformers between elec- V
tions" are beginning to veer around ti
toward the people again. el
We would not give a cancelled G
postage stamp for a thousand re
forms who are not reformers on
election day.
There is about as much genuine oi
principle in some of the reform or
howlers as there is nutriment in f<
the foam on soda water.
hi
A bill has been introduced in it
the Louisiana legislature by Sena- fc
tor Watts, providing for an un- et
limited Constitutional Convention. w

Things are now in good shape lo
for the contest for the offices of
this parish which were filched on
April 28th, by the refusal of men fr
to follow the law. ti
We had just as soon be a car
pet-bagger from Boston with a ne
gro constituency, as to be a white m
officee holder who had stolen the of- PC
flee from his white friends and Pc
neighbors.
St
There was a time when to be an ca
office holder meant that onesfriends o8
had honored him, but nmee the la- ao
test patent was taken out en eleo- ti
tion machinery in this State, the cal
fat that a man holds olce is cause lo,
for suspicion as to his Integrity. ha
It is said that polities makes m
strange bed-fellow.. We do not w
know who coined the words, but it
most have been some one with p
the spirit oaf prophesy, and his eyeM
mst have been on the preseat con
glemeration known as the govern
met al Louisiana. al
Perhaps before this reaches the to
printer, the Seuatorial question ha
will be settled, but if it is not, we cl
pray that ao Popolist will so iaoult tu

The Situation in Our State.
Another rarce has been l)layocl
and another step toward an auto
cracy has been taken and still we
live, and some people believe this
is "the land of the free and the
home of the brave."
No one who knew Democracy
when it was the champion of right
and the friend of the people, would
A recognize even a semblance of it
self in the political corporation
known m this State as the Demo
cratic party. There was a time
when the name was dear to the
u people, when a man would almost
a strike his friend if he should charge
o anything dishonorable or selfish to
the party, but how is it now ?
Compared to its former self it is
about as unblushing and dyed in
shame, as the harlot compared to
the virgin. There is now no pre
tension to honesty or fair dealing.
but like a gaming table suearround
ed by black-legs, many of the
leading spirits would consider it,
puerile to be considered honest.
When men are so unblushing in
their schemes of rascality as to de
clare that they have the power and
intend to use it to their own ad
vancement and interests, no mat
ter whether they are regularly
elected or not, it is time for the
people to ask themselves what is
coming next.
There is only one hope for re
form in this State, and that must
dome by the Australian ballot law,
or something similar. It is against
our principles, established by the
founders of the republic, to have
"taxation without representation,"
but what are we having to-day, if
it is not that in its most repulsive
form i With such a law, enforc
ed, as it would be, a part at least
will have representation, and this
part being identified in general in
terest with the great masses, would
look after the general welfare, and
perhaps in a few years such prog
ress could be made that disbarment
from political rights might be en
tirely removed.
As matters now stand, a few
men with the political machinery,
manufactured for that express pur
pose, can perpetuate themselves in
power against the will of the
wealth and intelligence of the =
State. The Democratic party-eo
called-retains its hold upon the I
offices throughout the State by ex
aetly the same mesan and through "
the same influences that the old 1
carpet-ba Bepublican party so I
long kept its foot-hold. While we
had faith in the justness of thel
masses of men, we believed it i
wrong to debar a large number of (
people from the privilege of a
proteting their personal rights t
through the use of the b bllot'but
sinmce, we see that the amses od the '
Stat. are unable or unwilling to
cope with this oetopm of a politi- i
esal corporatioa, we believe it best 
to marrow the fight down to a white
basis, believing that the true prin- t
aples of Amerianism will assert d
themeves whbenever this aight- i
mare of negro domination is re
moved. There are too many w
people who are still silly enough to "
believe that the egro wants ofie,~
and wants to dictate the course of
polities so long as e u a roe hasA

lon to thiselIs, bwt h avme tn

n from the latter. Let us have an
election law that will give no fac
tion or party the advantage of the
other, and then let this great ele
ment that is of so much use to our
enemies be eliminated from poli
tics. Your vote does not count
now, so you had just as well not
cast it, but let your friends who
are eligible and identified with you
fight your political battles for
you. Go to work and learn enough
to be able to make out an Austra
lian ballot, and then you will not

- For the LOUISIANA POPULIST :
1 Baton Rouge, La., May 23, '96.
Another week of the Legisla
- ture has come and gone, and but
' little done.
The Senatorial question is ab
sorbing all the attention and in a
measure shaping the lines of all
- future legislation, thus proving
t one reason why the People's party
is correct in demanding the elec
t tion of U. S. Senators by a di
i rect vote of the people.
A Senator. will in all probability
be elected by Wednesday of next
f week, or before this reaches our
readers. It will be either Walter
-D. Denegre, or the Administra
t tion candidate, Newton C., or An
drew Price. For if Foster finds
he cannot land Blanchard, he will
I turn all his forces to Price, the
I gold bug.
Foster has already opened his
arms to Denegre and offered to
make him Senator if he would on
ly join the Administration and be
its candidate and its supporter, but
Mr. Denegre scorned the offer, and
refuses to go to the U. S. Senate
on any combine whatever.
This bold, independent, manly
stand is rapidly winning friends
for Mr. Denegro from the Popu
lists, and it is quite probable that
they will withdraw Capt. Pharr's
name, which they have no hope of
landing, and support Denegre in a j
body to defeat the Administration.
This course will strengthen them
materially in their stand for an
honest election law and an early
Constitutional Convention. What. I
ever course they take in this mat- I
ter, the Populists will be ably sec
onded by the Republican members,
who have patriotically pledged
themselves to stand by their Pope- u
list allies "till the last day in the '
morning."
The Demoorats are continuing
their bad amsnement, and are
daily destroying the tottering old
hulk of the Democratic party, In
telligent leaders, not binded by
Sgreed for spoils, could have made
much political capital in favor ofa
the Democratic party out of the1
qaestions confroning this General j
Assembly at its opening, but the I
leadersof that party do not seem
to understand the Arst prioiple of
statesmansp.
Tbheir followers at home wbo J
Lhve .do.m.ed the word with
their patriotm and gatlUbiLty byI
ciaing ainsto t aibrorokm pledg
es of a faithless party, are to-day
obtless toiling ander their un- I
necesary burdens, made heavier
by the Democracy which they have
so loyally supported, while their
reprmesentative here are wsallowing
i dleness, or falling over eachlS
other to do homage to say sal
who an give them spoils.

r State should lend his assistance to

t that the Flopper will be satisfied

We hope to send in our next ti

Assembly over his Fraudulency.
Respectfully,
HI. L. BRIAN.
The rumor is afloat that leading
Democrats all over the State are
going to circulate petitions among
the county Democrats to send to
the legislature to get that body to em
call a Constitutional Convention.
It is said that this movement is
inaugurated to prove the falsity of
the statement of some of the city
papers that it is the country I)em
ocrats who are opposing the calling
of an early convention with un
limited powers. 11 e do not believe
that such action by the Democrats
in the country will have any effect
on the legislature, for the Foster
administration is now enstalled and
is very well satisfied with the situ
tion. The outs may have the
cheek to get up a petition but the
in's will have the gall to refuse to 0]
pay any attention to it. No Aus
tralian ballot law will suit Foster
or his minions, they need the 11
literate negro in their business, Sta
and would not take a niekel-plated
jews-harp for him. ant
Tette who was robbed in No

nug up against an elections com
mittee of which Wilkinson, of
Red River is chairman, and
Boggs is a member I The Ree
River man most have a contempt
for such paltry steals as a ma-"
jority of only 4 on the face of
the returns when one negro ward
in Red River gave Wilkinson
444 votes. The commissioners
mast have played poker before
the count, and the chief manipu
later must have won on three
