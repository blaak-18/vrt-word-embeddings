than her share of attention, for. in the
* jpro+miade, and more noticeably in the
j whirl of the dance, a faint musical
"tiklding of belles marked her move
ments and beat time to the rhythm of
her step.
None of the many male admirers
-thatflocked around her could discover.
the source. -of the mysterious chimes,
till a twinkle of her white kid slipper
explained the puzzle. A tiny gold bell
was fastened to her' instep, and its
tongue kept up a continual prattle,
calling attention to its fair owner.
At one-of the large Broadway Jew
elry stores a New York Journal re
r learned that bells for ball slip
em have been worn abroad, especially
-i Frrnce, for years. Here, however,
they are such a decidedly novel impor
Stition that they are very hard to find.
This difficulty will, of course, exist
only for a very short time, as the sm
mediate demand will create a rapid
supply.
There is room for a variety of tastes
and a variety of expenditures, in pur
chasing these miniature tintinnabula
tions. It is possible to get them in tin
and cheap metals as low as eight cents
a dozen. These come in many colors,
green, red, gold, blue and white, and
can be adapted to any costume.
But, of course, it will never do for
swagger people to wear anything so
cheap, and nothing but sterling silver
or eighteen-carat gold will find its way
to the instep of society.
At present the silver or gold bells of
the more expensive grades will have to
be made to order, but this will only
add a new charm to.them, and the addi
tional-cost will be trifling. Cheaper
grades of bells can be secured at the
large drygoods stores, at agencies for
theatrical properties and at novelty
stores in general.
The miniature church bell is prefer
able, though very pretty effects may
be gained by strings of tiny sleigh
bells. If only one bell is used, it is
e sewed securely to the instep of the
slipper. Clusters of bells should be
strung on silk cord or small ribbons.
The above illustrations will suggest
" many ways of fastening the bells to
the slippers so as to secure sufficient
sound and enough artistic effect.
So now it can once more be said of
the society princess that:
With rings on her fingers,
And bells on her toes,
She shall make music
Wherever she goes.
HINTS FOR THE COOK.
Jx beating the whites of eggs for
meringue or frosting, do not add the
sugar until the egg is stiff.
Wu Vr there is not time to ice a cake,
remember that its appearance may be
greatly improved by dredging the top
with a little powdered sugar.
ALWAYS keep a jar of cracker dust
on hand for breading, or else save up
all pieces of bread, and once a month
dry them in an open oven, then place
them in a bag and pound until fine.
Foa rabbit pie the rabbit should be
cooked as for stew, the gravy thick
ened, and the whole put into a deep
dish and baked with a top crust and
strips around the sides, as beefsteak
pie is made.
HRic is the correct way to stone rais
Ins: Free the raisins from the stems and
then put them in a bowl. Cover them
with boiling water and let them stand
for two minutes. Pour off the water,
open the raisins, and the seeds can be
removed quickly and easily without
the usual stickiness.
RABsrIT may be stewed in the same
manner as chicken in. fricassee. It

A SNOWDROP TREE.
eow to Make a Novel and Pretty Decora
tlon for the Table.
By means of the following device
you can make a very pretty and novel
decoration for the table. Incline a
wax candle over a glass of water. As
each drop of melted wax falls into the
water it instantly takes the form of a
white cup, somewhat resemtling the
flower of the snowdrop. These cups
you can vary in size according to the
inclination of the candle. Now take a

piece of fine wire and slightly curve it
at one end. Heat the straight end of
the wire and pierce the center of the
wax flower while it is in the water.
Having made a hole through the flower
push it to the curved end. Prepare a
dozen wires in the same way and then
join them - together in the manner
shown in our illustration. You will
now have a beautiful tree of wax
flowers, which will make a pretty and
effective ornament.
Curds and Crem. Without Wine.
Into a quart of new milk, warm from
the cow (or heated to the same point
afterward), stir two tablespoonfuls of
extract of rennet. You can buy a bot
tle in any drug store for twenty-five
cents. Stir well, pour into a glass
dish, and leave in a warm place for
half an hour, then grate nutmeg over
the top, and set in a cokE place till
wanted. With it serve a jug of plain
cream, and a little maple sugar, scraped
down with a knife, and piled in a pret
ty little fancy dish or saucer. This is
instead of the sherry and sugar gener
ally stirred into the cream. Too sim
ple, is it? Just try it, and see that
your dessert will take five minutes to
make, and will cost you about ten
cents, unless you like it so well that
you have to make double quantity next
time.-Mrs. E. M. Jones, in Country
Gentleman.
Colors and Complezlons.
Every woman who is ambitious to
look her best should have a list for pri
vate consultation of trying colors.
Each complexion has its best and its
worst possibilities. Most persons can
wear dark blue or green, for instance,
but very fedw can wear dark red. It is
wise to accept one's limitations and
dress within them. If peacock blue is
unbecoming-and it usually is-why
should we make guys of ourselves by
donning it? It white is our kindest
-ally, why not choose white whenever
it is possible to have it?

Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People
without doubt mark the beginningof a more
healthful era. They were first compounded
by an eminent practitioner, and used as a
prescription for many years in general
practice with almost incredible success.
They are now given to the public as an un
failang blood buider and nerve restorer,
curing all forms of weakness arising from
a watery condition of the blood or shattered
nerves, two fruitful causes of almost every
ill that flesh is heir to. These pills are also
a specific for the troubles peculiar to ie
males, such as suppressions, all forms of
weakness, chronic constipation, bearing
down pains, etc., and in the caseof men will
give speedy relief and effect a permanent
cure in all cases arising from mental worry,
overwork cr excesses of whatever nature.

Now, steel-engraving is the direct
opposite to wood-angraving. The
scratches and cuts made on a wooden
block will be whit'in the print, and it
is only the uncut portiona of the block
that print black; .while on the steel the
unscratched portion leaves the paper
white.
When a design has been cut on a
steel plate, and it is ready to be print
ed, the ink is put on the plate or block,
and all the cuts and scratches become
filled with ink. Then the ink is carse
SIfully rubbed off of the surfacer so that
none remains except what is in the
lines. When a piece of dampened p.
per is placed on the plate and subjected
to very heavy pressure, it sinks lunte
the lines; .and when it is taken of! it
m draws the ink out with it, and thus the
m picture is printed on the paper.
It takes an engraver about six weeks
I or two months to complete one por
I trait, and a man whoengraves the por
-traits never does any other kind of en
g raving. Each engraver does only a
certain portion of the work on a note;
no one is permitted to engrave an en
I tire note; so that besides the portait
Sengravers, there are some who do noth.
ing but engrave the figures, the seal,
the lettering, the border, etc. In this
way it would be impossible for an en
I graver to make a complete engraving
for his own use, if he were dishonest
enough to do such a. thing.
I Besides - this manual work, some of
the engraving is done by machinery,
as, for example, the background of the
. portrait and of the borders, and the
| shading of the letters-this being done
by what is known as the ruling ma
chine, which can rule several hundred
I perfectly straight lines within an inch.
The intricate scroll and lace-work
around the figures on the face and the
back of the note is done by a wonder
ful machine known as the geometric
r lathe. This machine consists of a large
1 number of wheels of all sizes and in all
1 sorts of arrangements, together with a
complicated mechanism of eccentrics
and rods, all of which is incomprehen
sible to anyone but an expert machin
º ist.
r By a proper adjustment of its parts,
the delicate diamond point that moves
º about over the face of the steel is made
R to work out a perfect and artistic
pattern with greater accuracy and
me.ch more speed than could be done
by hand; and hence this delicate and
intricate part of the engraving is one
of the greatest obstacles with which
r the counterfeiter has to contend, for he
finds it next to impossible to imitate it
Fortunately for Uncle Sam, the geo
metric lathe is a very complicated and
very expensive machine,.and the coun
terfeiter is generally a poor man; and
even if he did manage tolay up enough
money to buy the lathe, it is hardly
likely he would live long enough to use
it properly; for there are only four men
in the world who understand how to
operate it.
Indeed, the man who now has charge
of the geometric lathe at the bureau of
engraving and printing is the only one
in the United States at the present
time who knows how to manage it; and
if anything should happen to him, it
! might tangle matters up for awhile in
this important branch of our Uncle
