INDEPENDENCE OF CANADA
few O)rlganictliv-n l'ropo~ s to Make it
£ulted Sitatle of CIanada.
Montreal, Jan. 3.-For some time
past there has b'en somni discussion
about the doings of aut alleged "inde
pendeice" club in Monitreal, but the
managers of the new movement did not
appear to judge the time opportune for
appealing to the public. A good deal
of interest was added to the movement
by the fact that during the Paris expo
sition a large number of young men ap
peared in Paris wearing "Independenco
of Canada," and an attempt was made
to connect J. I. Tarte and J. X. Per
rault, the Canadian commissioners,
with the movement because a number
of independence buttons were among
the spoils recovered from men who had
burglarized Mr. Perrault's house. Mr.
Perrault explained, however, that these
buttons were 15 years ol, and he hal
changed his views since.
Now the Canadian independence
league has issued its platform and con
stitution, but has declined to publish its
list of officers and members. The consti
tution consists of 18 clauses of which
the first sights are:
1. Absolute declaration of indepen
dence.
2. New federation to be known as
United States of Canada.
3. Province to become states with
sovereign power.
4. To have such powers as sh all be
delegated to it by sovereign states.
6. No power shall be delegated to the
federal authority except with the assent
of the majority of delegates of each of
the sovereign states convened in a na
tional assembly.
6. Creation of a state militia under
command of a federal officer.
7. Universal suffrage.
8. The great highways and services
(railways, canals, telegraphs, etc.) t" be
public property,
The others deal with changes in laws
along socialistic lines.

Manila, Jan. 3.-General MacArthur

hicles wound through the grounds of
the governor general's residence and
discharged their callers -official and
civilian -most of them natives, though
there were a sprinkhling of foreigners.
Admiral Remey received the callers
by the side of General MacArthur. and
the wives of several generals assisted.
The introductions were made by Geu.
MacArthur's staff, assisted by members
of the staff of Admiral Remey. The
callers, after having been introduced,
passed upon a broad balcony overhang
tag the Pasig river, and a number of
them lingered about the mansion until
the ceremonies were finished. Arch
bishop Ohappelle, the apostolic delegate
to the Philippines, and other church
dignitaries were received first.
The members of the Philippine com
mission and the judges appeared in.
black frock coats and their attire formed
a decided contrast to the white and gold
uniforms of the offows of the army and
•avy. The Filipino women wore elab

fably in Spanish.

living near this place, ca..e to town and
surrendered hirnmself to the authorities,
saying he had killed Andrew Mellin, his
hired man.
According to the story Barry tells he
discovered that an intimacy existed be
tween Mellin and his (Barry's) sister.
During the night the girl left the house
and after a long search Barry found her
on the praizie badly frozen. Taking her
to a Leighbor's house he returned home
and found Mellin in the barn. Locking
the door he told him he must die, and
gave him the choice of a rope or a knife.
Melliu refused either, and Barry then
placed the rope about his neck and pro
ceeded to hang him. A terrible strug.
gle ensued, and seeing he could not kill
his victim this way, Barry gave hil
fivly minutes to say his prayers. Hr
knelt to pray, Barry meantime rstanding
by hip side, watching him, watch in
hand. At the end of Frv, minu'tes h"

PRAISE FOR AMERICANS.
Two Especially Commlendedl for Sev-tees
in the Siege at Pekin.
Washington, Jan. 5.-The British am
bassador has communicateot to the sec
retary of state a dispatch received by
him from Marquti Lansdowne com
mending the gallant conduct of certain
Americans who distinguished them
selves last sumnwr during the att.cks
on the legation quarter in Pekin. The
text of tine dispatch is as follows:
"My Lord -With reference to my pre
ceiing dispatch of this date I hive to in
form you that Sir Claude Mac:Donald
hbs brought to my notice the conduct of
certain gentlemen who particularly dis
tinguished themselves during the attacks
on the legation quarter and who gave
invaluable assistance both to him per
sonally and to the defense in general.
Sir Claude mentions the names of Rev.
F. D. Gamewoll, of the American Meth
odist mission, and Mr. Herbert Squiers,
secretary of the United States legation.
He states Rev. Gamewell carried out
the entire defense of the Brttish lega
tion, and that these defenses have ex
cited the admiration of the officers of
the various nationalities who have since
inspected them. As a tribute to their
excellence he mentions that notwith
standing the constant rain of rifle fire
during the five weeks' siege, not a single
woman or child in the legation suffered.
He adds that a deep debt of gratitude is
owed to him by all the besieged.
"Mr. Squiers acted in the capacity of
Sir Claude's chief of staff after the
death of Captain Strouls of the royal
marines. Sir Claude says Mr.:Squiers'
earlier services in the United States
army were of great use in the defense
and that he cannot speak too highly of
his zeal and ability. The be rricades on
tartar wall were designed and carried
out by him and under Sir Claude's or
ders he drew the plan for the entry of
troops which was conveyed to General
Gasslee by a messenger let down from
the wall. I request that you will bring
the names of these two gentlemen to
favorable notice of the United States
government and express the apprecia
tion felt by her majesty's government
of their eminent services."

centralization of power and other great
issues on which the Democracy has here
tolore gone to the people and won many
a victory."

KRUGER MAY COME.
we Will Try to Interest the Prediol
as to hoer Independence.
New York, Jan. 5.-A dispatch to Tbh
Journal from London says:
It is almost certainly decided that Mr.
Kruger will go to America in February,
probably accompanied by W. T. Stead,
who will make a ringing campaign in
behalf of stopping the war. The Jour
nal's correspondent saw Mr. Stea, just
before he left for Paris in company with
John E. Milholland, who bore an invite
tion from prominent New Yorkers to
Mr. Kruger to visit America. While in
Paris they will see the leaders of the ar
bitration movement in Europe and de
oide definitely on plans. Mr. Stead
said:
"The time has oome for President Kru
ger to play his trump card and boldly
declare his intentio .to visit President
l McKinley in orde, to pea4.with hips
the cause of in4ependenoe of.ths South
African republics, He doesnot believe
the American governmca t lnditerero
to the wars the Boers are waging
against the British monarchy. "It he
goes to Ameria he will go as presi
dent to visit a president. He will prob
ably arrive in New York by the middle
of February. The state of his health is
not regarded as likely to deter him from
crossing the Atlantic."

New York, Jan. fI.- -Oharles D. Pierce,
consul general of the Orange Free State
in New York, and treasurer of the Boer
relief fund in America, has given out
the following statement:
"The news coming to us every day,
both by public and private cable, shows
the reported conquest of the Boers to be
a delusion. There are under arms on the
Boer side over 16,000 hardy, determined
invincible patriots -of which 5tOs0 are
now invading Cape Colony-against the
210,000 troops landed from (;reat Britain
and her dependrencies.
"The British invaders have lost over
4n per cent of that force. The Boers'
total losses in kx;led and dyu;: from
wounds have rot ex.eedrd Ii,0, but
their loss in pro,. rtv and inL the iripov
