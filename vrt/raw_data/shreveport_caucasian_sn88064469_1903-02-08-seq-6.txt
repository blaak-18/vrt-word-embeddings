Not at All Envered.
Phoenix, Ariz.. Feb. 6.-Although
the admission of Arizona and New
Mexico as one state has been frequent
ly' suggested, it was never given se
rious consideration here until the pub
lication Wednesday of dispatches an
nouncing that friends of the omnibus
bill were favoring such a compromise.
The news created consternation here
and the protest is almost universal.
Upon the assembling of the legislature
Wednesday a telegram was read from
Delegate Smith reciting the conditions
and stating he was opposing the com
promise. If his attitude was not in ac
cord with the people he wanted to
know it so he could inform congress.
A resolution was passed opposing the
compromise.

Randell was before the committee on
indian affairs in the interest of his
bill relative to the fellow servants law
in the Indian Territory, as at present
railroad employes are not liable for in

bill removes this difficulty and makes
corporations liable for injuries sustain
ed in the service. whether caused by
the negligence of a fellow servant or
not.

and eastern capitalists, which was or

a~n Francisco acquired from the for
mer owners and consolidated in the
system bow known as the United Rail

Practice Reofrred to by Senators.
Washington, Feb. 6.-The discussion
of the statehood bill in the senate
Thursday turned on the question of
poly;amy. A number of senators who
heretofore have taken no part in the
debate participated in the discussion.
Mr. McComas had started the debate
Wednesday by criticising the pending
bill as being too liberal and when the
subject came up Thursday *Mr. Gal
linger adverted to his remarks and
said that he was in favor of an amend
ment covering this question as strong
as could be drawn. The influence of
the Mormon church over politics oc
cupied a large share of the debate
which Mr. Hale characterized as inter
esting, valuable and startling, because
it had disclosed a powerful religious
organization "exerting itself as a dom
inant, potential force," over the mind
and action of its followers, which
should be taken into account in future
legislation.
Mr. Dubois of Idaho declared that no
polygamist could occupy any high po
litical place without the consent of the
first president of the Mormon church.
The same influence, he said, was ex
ercised in New Mexico and Arizona.
He said that Idaho could control the
Mormon peopl, whenever it so desired.
TRUST QUESTION.
One Said Regulation 1.\Wi, Intended, but
Others Cal!e.t :t ;i sh·lk.
Washington, Feb +- -The anti-trust
bill debate, which opened in the house
Thursday, did not develop much ani
mation, although there was a fairly
large attendance in the galleries. The
rule under which the house was to op
erate, however, precipitated a lively
discussion. The Democrats protected
vigorously against the rule for consid
eration of the bill because it did not
permit them to secure a record 'vote
on a substitute, but the Republicans
replied that they were willing to ac
cept the responsibility. The bill to ex
pediate anti-trust prosecutions occa
sioned no debate. It passed the house,
as it did the senate, without a word of
debate. Mr. Powers of Massachusettsi
(Rep.) made the opening argument for
his side of the house on the judiciary
committee bill and Mr. Clayton of
Alabama (Dem.) opened for his side.
The former contended that the pend
ing measure was a step in the direc
tion of regulation of trusts, while Mr.
Clayton insisted that it was a shami
and pretense and that the bill, feeble
as it was, never was intended to go
on the statute books.

whose peculiar acoustic properties have

after the manner of their kind, to look
unconscious and making nut very
poorly. as is
usually the ease.
Stepping on otne
of the echo
stones to gaze at
a new statue,
they were spied
by two youthful
pages, who im
mediately "'spot

ists. One of the
ioys stelpped t6
ech o0lo stone
1' oie on the opposite
side of thlie gal

whisper asked:
"W1hen did
you get r
ried ?"
The young
couple looked at
each other and
uTEY LOOKED AT EACII then aounlld the
OTIER- hall. The bride
flushed rosy red, and the bridegroom
looked uncomfortable. Again they
glanced around the hall, but could not
discern from whence the voice came.
"When did you get married?" again
came the mysterious question.
Awestricken and looking extremely
foolish, the young couple precipitately
tied from the chamber.
Representative Cochran of Missouri
the other day recalled an interview he
had some time 'ago
"Jolhnnyon with Chairman Payne
of the ways and
the Spot" means committee.
4l '" "During the first
few days of the session." said he. "I
introduced a bill to repeal the duty on
coal: I went to the ways' and means
chairman and requested that the com
mittee give the measuie consideration.
"'Will you give the bill consideration
if I secure a petition of the members of
the house for it:' I inquired.
" 'You had better bring a copy of the
Lord's Prayer along with you."' an
swered Mr. Payne. But Mr. Cochran
now feels that congress has justified
his legislative wisdom by enacting a
bill like his into law.
In the senate Mr. Nelson of Minneso
ta has tiled a claim on the original
anthracite repeal bill, as he was John
uy on the spot at a very early day and,
after reading the president's message
on the subject, drew a bill to carry out
that recoinmmendation.
This story of Washington life was
told by Representative James Rankin
, Youong to a group of
She Had colleagues in the house i
cloakroom the other
Expectation day:
------- "I was in a book
store on the avenmu when a young I
woman came in and pricd some books.
"'Do you make any reduction to a
minister's wife?'
S'Yes. ma'am,' said the eterk. 'Are
you a minister's wife?'
"'Oh. no.' replied the lady; 'I am not
married.'
"'A minister's daughter, then?'
"'No.'
"The clerk was puzzled.
"'May I ask your relationship to the
church?' he inquired.
" 'Oh, said the young woman bright
ly, 'I am engaged to a theological stu
dent.' "
On a recent evening a young and en
thusiastic reporter called on Senator
^ Quay to make some in
' quiries regarding
Quay "ad certain phases of
the Pennsylvania politics.
Reporter The senator, who was
reading in his library,
received the newspaper man cordially,
and a time was spent in general con
versation. Just as the reporter was
ready to spring his first question Sena
tor Quay asked:
"Do you like to play poker?"
"Sometimes I play," the reporter con
fessed.
"Well," said the senator, "then you'll
like this little poker story by Eugene
Ware. I think it is one of the best I
have seen."
He handed a book to the reporter,
who, out of politeness, read a page.
"Ah," said the senator. "I see you
are interested. Take the book along
and read it at your leisure. Good even
ing"
When the dazed seporter reached the
street he looked more closely at the
"little" poker story and found that it
contained fifty-nine pages.
When it became known that Presi
dent Roosevelt would appoint Robert
B. Armstrong, Secretary Shaw's pri
vate secretary, to the post of assistant
beretary of the treasury to succeed
General Spaulding, there was an epl
demie of heart failure among the sup
porters of older candidates for this im
portat position. They insisted that
Armstrong was too young and Inexpe
rienced in the \duties which would de
;atve upon him.
One avt these obieetors went to Beere
L;~~~~~~
;'~- a ~
hlad= thoiroighly c ,ovin ed him that'
here was material for a competent as
sistant secretaryof the treasury.
"Armstrong is all right. Mr. Seer,
tary." said he. "but is he not just a lit
tie youlg:'"
"W'hy I don't know. I',rharp !:e 1s.

assertion related a story about IIa::l:
White. a native of the (;:reen Mounitailt
State. who was a noted minstrel and i.,
credited with being the original "end
manll." One of White's jokes used to
run this way:
"So you come from Vermont'?" the
middle man would ask.
"Yes. I amu proud to say I was born
and raised in tIle good old state of Ver
mont," W\Vhite w-ould answer.
"You make pretty good maple sugar
up) in Vermtont."
"Yes, our mllapile sugar is the sweetest
on eartlh."
"llave somne pretty good horses up
there too."
"The Morgan horses bred in V\'rmont
are not excelled anywihere in the
world."
"Pretty girls, el?"
"V,'rmont has the prettiest girls in
America."
"Well, Vermont must ble pretty much
of a state," the middle mlan would say
in conclusion.
'`It's the greatest state in the Union."
was White's answer. "'There Is just
one thing about it I don't like. For
about six weeks in midsummer, when
the snow melts off. we have to drag
around on wheels."
Representative Shattuc of Ohio the
other day put this question to Repre
sentative Mercer of Nebraska, who, it
will be recalled, was defeated at the
last election:
"Are you any relation to the ball
player named Mercer who killed him
self the other day?"
"What was his first name?" asked
Mr. Mercer.
"Win." answered Mr. Stattuc.
"No relation," said Mr. Mercer.
"There hasn't- been a 'win' in our fam
ily since before election."
This tale of the woes of a congress
man is told by Representative Powers
of Massachusetts. Mr.
SWoe of iPower} prefaces his
story with a beautiful
a Congre-ss picture of domestic
man happiness beyond the'
.-- . - reach of Wicked coal
barons. It was-tfter he had retired for
the night with the perfect peace' that
comes with the knowledge that there is
enough coal in the house to last over
night that he was awakened by his
wife's frantic shouts:
'The house is on fire! There are bur
glars in the house! There's an earti
quake!"
These were some of the terrible
things which she forced upon his
sleepy mind. As he awakened he heard
a thunderous rapping at his door. and
when he had sufficiently regained his
composure the valiant representative
of the Bay State descended the stairs
and discovered at the door a dimiuu
tive messenger boy holding in hands
that trembled with cold a telegram.
Breaking the envelope with feverish
excitement and anxiety. Representa
tive Powers tead. "Don't take any ac
tion In the postoffice quarrel until you
receive my letter, which is on the
way."
There was no need of a fire in the
house for the rest of the night.
An applicant for office called on
President Roosevelt the other day and,
as showing an especial reason why he
should get the place, said with due
emphasis:
"Mr. President. I have enlisted Sena
tor Foraker and Senator Hanna in my
support."
"Delighted, delighted!" was Mr.
Roosevelt's characteristic exclamation.
"Now, my friend, if you will go out and
get Senator Beveridge and Senator
Fairbanks to agree on anything in the
world I'll give you the White House."
Civil Service Commissioner William
Dudley Foulke has a seven-year-old
grandson living
with him this

went with his
grandmother to
