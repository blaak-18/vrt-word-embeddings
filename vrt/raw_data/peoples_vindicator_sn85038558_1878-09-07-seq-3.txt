Why ask a fellow whten he meets.

Why sit a woman on the floor

Why is it women all prefer

Why is it they prefer arag
For washing, to a sponge ?
Why is it women uroau and moan
Of what they have to do,
Yet gladly walk a score of miles
To match a shade of blue '?
The huckleberry days have coma,
The blackest of the year,
When every face is dark with stains
And smeared from ear to ear;
When fair Melinda quaffs the fruit
And then, with fondness rash,
Pops her Augustus on the mouth
And soils his pink mustache.
This is thet joke that made listeners
writhe:-"When time is no mower, he'll
hang up his scythe."
