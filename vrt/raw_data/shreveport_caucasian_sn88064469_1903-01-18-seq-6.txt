Albuquerque, N. M., Jan. 13.-The re
cent meeting of the Arshaeologieai in
stitute has revived public Interest in
this territory as posstessing more relies
of historic value than any ltter part of
the United States. The impetus thus
given to the study of New Mexico's'
archeological remains has been
strengthened by a statement made by
fermer Governor Prince. himself an
archeologist of repute. during a visit
to New York. He found the people
of the east desirous of learning more
,about New Mexico than they have
been taught in the past, and the state
ment given by him covers the ground
with great exactitude.
In beginning governor Prince said
that the antiquities of New Mexico
mlght be dividedInto four classes. First
,thee were the prehistoric relies, which
owere 4n existence when (Columbus die
etered America. Then there were the
riwtres of the Pueblo Indians. dat

On the east side of the 1io (rande
are the remains of a series of towns
which were occupied at the time of the
Spanish explorations and up to 150
years ago. In each of these was a
church, built by the I ranclsean fa
thers, but they are all falling to pieces
from neglect.
Governor Prince. who had just been
reading the minutes of the last meetr
ing of the trustees of the American
Scenic and Historic Preservation soci
ety, in which mention was made of the
sale of old custom house documents in
New York for waste paper, said he was
reminded thereby of the action of Gov
ernor Pyle of New Mexico, who some
forty years 'ago signalised his admin
istration by - selling a quantity of old
Spanish archives to grocers and mer
chants In which to w ap their butter
and other goods. One merchant, more
appreelptive than the governor of the
value of the documents which came
bhis possession. preserved them.
d they were eventually returned to
e government. They Included some
*-y valuable legal documents.
' Foremost of the relies of the Span

SAn Francisco, Jan. 16.-Among the
passengers on the steamer Newport
from Panama and way points were
Lieutenant Arthur H. Dutton and J. J.
Many and four enlisted men of the
American manned Colombian cruiser
Bogota, which sailed from this port
Oct. 7. They speak in anything but
enthusiastic terms of their experiences
in Colombian waters: Lieutenant Dut
ton, who was executive officer of the
Bogota in a signed statement says:
"I never heard of a eourtmartial
while I was in Columbia. Punishment
was carried out and sentences inflicted
at the sweet will of those in power.
The so-called discipline of the armies
was maintained -by the bullet or the
lash. Trifling offense at times was
punished by 500 lashes on the bare
back with a flexible cane. Men were
shot for more nothing. A few days aft
er peace was declared two Liberal of
feers who refused to acquiesce in con
ditions, were captured and taken to
Chiqul fortress and thbre lashed bru
tally until dead. Some prisoners, who
had been taken after a particularly
stubborn resistance had their legs
or arms out off or their eyes or ears
removed and were then released, to
go maimed through life. Some died
from the less of blood. One of the sev
eral schooners loaded with refugees
which the Bogota was towing sprung
a leak in deep water at sea. The
refugees were rescued and the captain
and crew of live men were about to
follow them when the Colombian offi
cer in charge ordered them back on
board the doomed schooner. Let them
perish with her, he exclaimed.
"Six of the unfortunates, innocent
of any wrong doing, were left to their
fate on the aitikipg schdoner, with no
palls and no boats."

SWEDES STARVING.
Deplorabio ('onditonn4 Omntluuto to Pre
vail Amhning Thouire People.
London, .Jan. 16.-A telegram from
Stnclholn confirms the distrc issing ac
c',unts of famine in northern Sweden.
About hu,000 peopie art' W fect'- by
this famine. which extend; froi the
sixty-first to the sixty-seventh ddere'
of north latitude and from the Gulf
of Bothnla and the Russian horder far
into the Interior.
Starving people are eating f ine
bark. which is dried. ground to powder
mixed with stewed Iceland mioss and
made into a kind of famine bread.
Coincident with the failure of crops
is the extreme scarcity of fish.
Fisherman are returning from expe
ditions empty handed. Even ptarmi
gan, usually found in great numbers In
the stricken districts, have almost
completely-disappeared. It is estima
ed expenditure of about. $6.300,000 will
be necessary to save the population
from decimation.
Thus far about $200.000 has been
subscribed, of which sum over $12,
500 was sent by Swedes in the United
States. This amount does not Include
the money necessary save the breed of
cattle which alone can live through
the Arctic winter or supply seed for
spring sowing. Peasants are making
pathetic sacrifices to avert extermina
tion of the hardy northern cattle.
RANGE QUESTION.
Resolution Thought to He A-reptabte to
Cattle and Mherpmen Indurned.
Kansas City. Mo., Jan. 16.-At the
third day's session of the National
Livestock Association conwention,
many papers were read and discussed,
and a flood of resolutions introduced
and considered.
An important resolution introduced
was one which sought to heal the long
standing bitterness existing between
cattle and sheep men over the question
of ranges. A. F. Robertson of Texas
had Wednesday introduced a resolu
tion calling for an amendment to the
la*s regulating grazing on public
lands* and approving leasing of such
lands in states where such policy is
desired by the people. This was re
ferred to the executive committee and
finally laid upon the table. In its
place a substitute prepared by cattle
men and which, it is said, was ap
proved by sheepmen and by many cat
tlemen was indorsed. The resolution
says the laws governing the use of
public lands in the United States have
become obsolete owing to the rapid ad
vance' of civilization, and that the
time has some for action by congress
in lawn recognising. changed condi
tions, encouraging settlement and of
fering protection to settlers using
land for grazing purposes. The reso
lItion- endorses the suggestion of
President Boc velt that a large area
of semi-arid a&nds be allowed for
homesteads and that commission ex
perts be .ppdiated to Investigate the
present ezlsling condition and suggest
to cnagress just sand tair remedies
that will assist-the growth oothe west.
