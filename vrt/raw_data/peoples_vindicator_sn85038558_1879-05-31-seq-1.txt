is felt under the shoulder blade, and to
it frequently extends to the top of the at
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken on
for rheumatism in the anrm. The stom. wi
ach is affected with loss of appetite RI
and sickness; the bowels in general ,,
are costive, sometimes alternative with th
lax: the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull. heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen* t,
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation ft
of having lift um done something which
ought to h,.'een done. A slight, tC
dry cough is Smetimes an attendant.
The patient c. .nplains of weariness I

feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the e1

beneficial to him, yet he cin scarcely hi

Jackson, Miss., May 7.-"P'r'aps of
you don't know thalt I've built myself S
a gravestone. Wal, it's a fact. I've Ca
put $17,00) into it. I think it's pro. V
dent for a man to be his own admin- J'
istrator. It's business. And I'm goo 8P
ing to be my owa administrator. ti
That's the reason I've bailt my grave
atone for $17;000 ecsh before I die." 01
The speaker was Edward Rihebad m
son, of Jackson, Miss., the most ac- bi
five and inlueutial business man in *
Missisuippi, if not in the youth. He hi
mniiwd a moment, and contioed with to
a chuckle: O
"Did ye ever hear what Tom Young N1
said about my gravestone! Tom had ai
taken an estra toddy, and be looked li
at my statue-I have a life-size statue ki
on the top of my gravestone-and he i
said, said Tomni, 'There's old Ned hI
Richardson, by heaven, with one eye y
on the penitentiary and the other on tli
tihe capitol.'"
Old Ned Richardson is constantly
after conviect labor, and he is reputed
to Ie the 1proprietor of the Legisla
tre whlen he wants to he, and his TI
statue faces ti" rCnpitml and the peni.
tcImImarer, as Ton Young said it did.
Mr. Richarduen lives in Jackson,
buit hie ihas property in.terests al oves N
the state. He owuns nineteen plants- gi
tiona in the 'mrvellonsly rich river at
country above Vicksburg, inciading th
parts of Washington and Issaquena w
counties and the Yazoo districts. He
has 18,000 acres under cultivation- is
15,000 of them In cotton. He raises L
above 10,000 bales or 45,000,000 si
iounds of cotton oanonually. He has ,
I000 acres in corn and oats,. forthe D
support of his stock and bhis people. of
And yet he has not land enough. is
Whenever a planter Is bard-up and ,
wants to sell his place for cash, he app
plies first to old Ned Richardson, rr
knowing that from bhim be will get aS
cash oder, though a low one. I heard D
Mr. Richardson offer the owner of a
plantatioo $8000 cash for land which
the latter valued at $15,000; and, f
though the offer was at first refused,
I was under the impression that it
would ultimately be accepted. Nor t
is Mr. Riqhardson's distinction dein- e
ed only or solely from bli plantatias. C
He onstrols the cotton market to a
higher degree thano say other living is

When be takes snet all the other Z
brokers sneeze. As member of thie b

than 100,000 hales of cotton annually. ht
He is the heaviest exporter. He has a
constantly the largest supplies on <t

kept hack the balk of his crop. He 8

Last week he let a lot go for eleven ri

Assnetainig in his mills, and asserted n
that 435 out of tihe 550 emplaoyed li
therein would have done nothing for d
the1i own livelihood if they had not hb
beea ofered these situations. Ii
I asked why thes tills were put at a it
distanee froe the river, apparently ot a
an out-of-the-way place. The ao- X
awer was that they were then ina the T
midst of a rich wool-growing see- II
lion. The mills use 1300 to 1400 bales Ii
of wool, or 600,000 ta 700,000 pounds, b
and all the wool, as well as all the t
cotton, is brought to the door on aI
wagons from the neighboring country. a
Jeans, striped cottons and brown si
goods are the principal products of i
the mills. al
Mr. Richardson owes a cottoo seed a
oll mill on the Mississippi and has b
many other small irona In the fire; a
but these oanly do, as Col. Sellers '
says, "for side investments" to keep d
his money employed. He is reputed
to be worth fromn$,000,000 to $5,000," v
000, and though he and his partner at ,
New Orleans have $,400,000 already ft
adrvaned on the growing crop, they ,
have still left more money than they ,
know how to employ. They. are i
frightened away from government
bonds by the prospect of only 4 per
cent, but they are after investments h
that will yield 10 to 12 per est. g

utterly unprepared to reosit anything A
like a serious attack, and, never
dreaming of danger, there were a
handful of volunteers, some men of
the Twenty-foorth, and some civil.i
iess; about 80, all told. They were dig
under the command of a couple of tkic
young lieutenants, Bromhead, of the a
Tweat.v-fourth, and Chard of the imp
Royal Engineease. They knew moth- vs
ing of the bitter business that had gig
been going on at the camp. Their of
first intimation of trouble arose from wi
seeing fugitives making for the river, ru
and, in the distance, natives in par- co
suit. Seeing danger, the youang
Lieutenants called their men to arms sh
and commenced to torn their com. al
missariat stores to account. They blI
bhad a vast quantity of meal In . bagp o
and a large store of biscuit in tines.
These, under the young Engineer'sr
direction, they hastily '

iA young man, whose exterior in
dicated that he was a fresh imports t
tion from the rural districts, entered
a barber shop yesterday, aid etond- b
lag limeself at full length in tohe only
vacant chair, requested the bareer t ,I
give him a cleas shave. The knight t
of the raezor at once began to eamply
with the request; and soon had the
rustic's two week's growth of bristles
covered with a heavy lather.
"Ges I had Jost as well have 'e k
'shied up while I'P restiag cosfort- f*
able," said the rustic, and a boot
black lmmediately set bimself to work
on the countryman's brogans.
The work ofrendvation was pro
greeelsg satis orily, whea 'the fre
beli jst aroud thes corer suddeonly
soounded a alarm. At the first stroke b
of the bell the rustic sprung from the
chair as if he had seceived an elec- i
trick shock, and grabbing his hat, Ii
started on a dead rum for the 'engine
house. In answer to the barber's ex.
cited query of "What's the matter V'
the ruestic replied, "By God, I'm gop
log to the fire !" re was hotly part ,
sued by the barber and the boot
black, each cararog with him tibe m
respective tool oft his craft.
The barber, thinking be was about
to lose his customer, sbohted "stop!
