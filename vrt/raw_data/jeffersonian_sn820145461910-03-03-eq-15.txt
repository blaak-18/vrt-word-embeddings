An Open Letter to Mr. H. A. Som
mers, Editor Elizabethtown
News.
•
Now, Mr. Sommers, here you are
again at some of your same old
tricks, evading an answer on a fair
and reasonable subject; one of local,
state and national importance, and
one that is prominent before the
public at present, and likely before
Congress in the near future. And,
knowing your ability as a writer,
and you soliciting through your pa
per, that your subscribers suggest
some subject for you to write an
editorial on, and when I thought the
situation over it appeared to me that
as you were a stockholder and direc
tor in the national bank at your
town, that it would be in keeping
with your practical knowledge of
banks and the agitation throughout
the country on the bank issue, that
I could not suggest a more appro
priate subject than to have you give
your readers an editorial; one which
would be of the greatest good to the
general public, a “central bank,”
like Senator Aldrich was advocat
ing, or a “postal savings bank” that
President Taft was recommending
to Congress.
•Now, Brother Sommers, as to your
reply, you start out by saying, “We
are stumped.” What do you mean
by that? Do you mean that you are
cut off? When a tree is cut off it
leaves a stump. You say that here
comes my old friend, S. J. Crow,
from way down at Safety Harbor,
Fla., asking you to write an editorial
on a “central bank that President
Taft and Senator Aldrich were advo
cating.” You know I did not state
it that way. Again, you say that I
suggested a subject that you knew
least about, and what does a coun
try editor know about banks any
way? Now, brother, if I have over
estimated your ability as a writer, or
your knowledge of the banking
question, I beg pardon;, since I come
to think I do recollect that back in
the nineties, when James B. Weaver
made a speech in Elizabethtown, and
showed up the national banking sys
tem and its class privileges, that you
stated in the News that Weaver
showed lamentable ignorance in his
statement. And when I asked you
to publish the national bank laws, if
Weaver had not correctly stated
them, as I would like to be put right
on the subject, for Weaver had
stated them as I understood them,
what was your reply then? It was,
that the banking laws had been pub
lished so often that you thought
every intelligent person understood
them. Now, Mr. Sommers, I can
more clearly reason along these lines
as time passes, and I have noticed
the company you have been training
with. You have been playing in the
backyard of Messrs. Cleveland, Wat
son, Parker, Bryan & Co. Hence
your ability to evade, and disability
to answer important questions. As
you seem to want to select, or say
that you expected the suggestion to
come from some of your subcribers
nearer home on roads, schools, or
local improvements, or some Ken
tucky matter of general inter
est. Now, as Kentucky has voted
an amendment to her Constitution, I
ask to withdraw that bank sug
gestion and give you another of your
own mention. I suggest that you
give your readers a better plan for
building public roads than J. S.
Coxey’s good roads bill. And don’t
think for a minute that because I
live a thousand miles down here in
Florida that I don’t feel an interest
in my old native State, and friends
and relatives back there. Yes, I dare
say that you and your kind, that you
have been training with, are all will
ing, as you say, to let the trusts run
the country without a central bank
to make it easier for them. Yes, if
you can read the handwriting on the
wall of this central bank movement,
you can surely see that your country
banks will be used as catspaws to
pull the chestnuts out of the fire for
the Wall street gang.

Now, Mr. Sommers, I am sorry you
are in this plight; cut loose from
those guides of yours and read War
wick Martin’s book, “Money of Na
tions,” the “Seven Financial Con
spiracies,” or Watson’s “Hand Book
of Politics,” and learn what you pre
tend you don’t know, and what pure,
unadulterated Democracy is, and you
may become a Jackson yourself some
day.

Hand-Book of . .
Politics and Economics
In this large volume Mr. Watson gives a mass of the most
valuable statistical information bearing on every great subject,
political and economic; the history of political parties and a sum
mary of all political platforms.
He also gives a history of national legislation, especially of
that class of legislation which now oppresses the common people.
The National Banking System is fully explained, and its
evils demonstrated. The black chapter of financial legislation
which began with the Civil War and which had its culmination
in the panic of 1907, is given in full.
In this book you will learn all about our system of tariff tax
ation. You will find in it the strongest arguments in favor of the
government ownership of railroads and other public utilities.
You will find a discussion of Socialism; the encroachments of the
Federal Judiciary; the peculiar injustice of the national Govern
ment to the farming class; the dangerous encroachments of the
Catholic clergy, and a clear statement of those remedies which
should be applied in order that the political body be made whole.
