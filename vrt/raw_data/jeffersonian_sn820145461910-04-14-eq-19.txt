But Beveridge’s speech before the Indiana
Convention, and the Convention’s indorse
ment of Beveridge’s fight on the tariff will
help the Democrats, our Democratic friends
tell us with confidence.
We don’t know whether it will or not.
As long as the Democratic party remains
split up and in a chaotic condition, as it now
is, it will not:
In fact, in the very speech in which he
threw defiance at the Payne-Aldrich-Cannon
gang, and which the Indiana Convention in
dorsed, Beveridge told what ammunition
would be used when it comes time to begin
firing at the Democrats.
Whenever he denounced a schedule and
told why he voted against it, he would end

The famous Chartier System of
Shorthand, taught exclusively in this
section at Bagwell Business College,
contains the alphabet, 8 rules and 64
word signs. That’s all. It can be
learned in half the time required for
the old-line systems, like Graham,
Pitman, Munson, etc., which contain
hundreds of rules and thousands of
word signs. The Chartier System is
not only briefer and more quickly
learned, but it can be written faster
and read more accurately. The
splendid success of Bagwell gradu
ates in holding the best positions has
proven these facts beyond all doubt.
Bagwell Business College also
teaches the latest and most up-to-date
system of Bookkeeping. It has two
of the best penmen in the South em
ployed to teach Penmanship. Indi
vidual attention is given to all pu
pils and every graduate is placed in
a position.

that part of his speech by saying, “But Dem
ocratic Senators did stand and fight for it,
and stand for it now.”
It was so with the iron ore schedule; the
lumber schedule; the woolen schedule; the
cotton cloth schedule; the structural steel
schedule; the petroleum schedule; and all the
way down the line.
Mr. Beveridge stated the truth, and the rec
ords of the votes show it.
The Democratic party will have to undergo
a thorough house-cleaning before it hopes to
reap the reward of the insurgent Republi
cans’ fight on the tariff.
Nearly every Democratic Senator got either
a steel or lumber splinter in his finger when
he touched the tariff schedules, and they have
made running sores, —just as the Democratic
Senators who stuck their hands in Old John

The Political Situation as Seen by a
Washington Woman
A sober-minded American may
naturally rub his eyes these days and
ask himself “where are we at” and
whither are we drifting. Our muni
cipal, State and Federal governments
are reeking with corruption. The
judiciary a synonym for venality.
The amazing spectacle is witnessed
of a bunch of Trust lawyers diving
headforemost into the political pork
barrel, emerging therefrom as Fed
eral Judges, and then arrogantly ve
toing the laws passed by the legisla
tive bodies of sovereign States.
Startling as this may seem, they but
follow those nine other ermined
luminaries, the Supreme Court —su-
preme in name and supreme in fact,
who solemnly nullify such laws as
the Income Tax after their enact
ment by the national representative
body. It is most remarkable that a
people supposed to be free have tol
erated this relic of tyranny so long in
their legal machinery. The System
selects a “safe and sane” President;
the “safe and sane” President se
lects the “conservative” lawyers (on
the recommendation of the System),
to fill the Federal and Supreme Court
benches, and the “jedges”, drawing
a fat salary and holding a life tenure
on the job, proceed to look wise, snap
their fingers in the face of the great
unwashed, and hand down decisions
that would make a dog sick. None
of your Machiavellian smooth-em
down-the-back finesse here; just a
simon-pure case of knock-down-and
skin-em-quick bunco.
Then there is that den of thieves
in Wall street, who gamble in the
products of honest industry, cover
their infamy with such delectable
terms as “hocking,” “pooling,”
“wash sales,” “shake downs,” etc.,
incidentally buy up a few States with
some United States Senators thrown
in, and nominate the Presidential
Cabinet.
The House of Representatives has
degenerated into a veritable kinder
garten of partisan windbags, cate
chised, bulldozed and tyrannized
over by dark-closet miscreants like
Payne, Dalzell and Joe Cannon; the
Senate a notorious Trust Associa
tion, licking the boots of such a crea
ture as Adrich.

wealthy young upstarts, pottering
old geezers, military sapheads, offi

femininity play the snob to sickening
perfection, and ape the hollow flum
mery of Bourbonistic courts.
Take the Aldrich-Taft-Payne tariff
bill, for which they called an extra
session of Congress so they could
hand it to us quick. A more base
betrayal and infamous piece of legal
ized robbery never crawled from the
Throne of Russia or the Divan of
Turkey. But let us possess our souls
in patience, the System would run
its sleek fingers deeper still into our
pockets. Having doctored the Postal
Savings Bank, Aldrich, the broad,
conservative statesman and friend of
the people, is about to dump his Cen
tral Bank Scheme upon the country,
the Ship Subsidy Bill looms up on
the legislative horizon, and the Taft-
Lovett Railroad Measure is not many
miles away. Could brazen-faced
greed and governmental iniquity go
further?
Overshadowing the natural mo
nopoly of railroads, controlling our
financial system through their chain
of national banks, and, by their arti
ficial, tariff-made monopolies, domi
nating the mineral products of the
earth, J. P. Morgan, J. G. Rockefeller
and their allied interests threw this
country into a sweeping panic dur
ing 1907, and they will do so again
at the psychological moment. What
an arraignment of our Government!
What a loathsome tyranny! Yet
dare assail the governmental favor
itism responsible for such a condi
tion, and you are a demagogue seek
ing to destroy the Government. Such
a Government ought to be destroyed.
It has no right to live, its existence
is a crime, and, unless its awful
abuses are abolished, will perish of
its own putrefaction.
But political lies, like all other
lies, must sooner or later yield to
truth. For forty-five years the peo
ple of America have blindly struggled
in the dark, shamelessly imposed up
on by rapacious Wall street sharks
and thieving tariff grafters. At last
the truths sown by their fearless
leaders begin to take root, the great
ocean-beds of humanity are astir,

As we have said before, the demand for a
change in conditions is strong, and is grow
ing stronger every day.
There will have to be a change soon, or the
Trusts will own the country.
Present conditions will soon reduce the
masses to poverty and starvation.
But the party that benefits by the dissatis
faction of this fast growing majority of the
people, must be a party that will make the
desired changes for the betterment of condi

NOTHING BUT POPULIST PRINCI

Dear Sir: —I desire to increase the
circulation of the ablest and greatest
defender of the peoples’ rights, the
two Jeffersonians.
It does seem to me it is a dull
mind, a dead heart, indeed, that
would not be aroused to patriotic ac
tion from reading their contents.
Populism as an organized party is
no more, but today there are ten
times as many hea'rt Populists as
there were in 1896, when we as a
party were crucified, and the “Crown
of thorns and cross of gold” placed
upon our brow.
I was a witness to the betrayal,
and when the Georgia delegation pa
raded behind the Bryan banner, my
sorrow, and I in my anguish exclaim
ed, “Poor Watson, you will be be
trayed.”
I had entirely forgotten every
resolution, and stalking there with
my Texas badge on, a bully, whiskey
sot of a Democrat jumped on me for
a discussion on nominating Bryan
and Sewall. This fired my Popu
lism, my hatred of the traitor
ours Democratic party, and as all of
us who had kept up with their record
knew by heart their every traitorous
act. I gave it cold from the shoul
der in emphatic language and in a
few minutes the crowd yelled hurrah
for Texas, and he retreated in the
crowd. At that time an old man
grasped my hand and congratulated
me and said, “I am from Missouri,
and perhaps you know me by repu
tation, I am Foster, the weather
prophet.”
I am more convinced today than
ever that Populism is right, and if
this Government is ever redeemed
from plutocracy it will be by its prin
ciples. Fraternally,
W. W. LITTLEFIELD.
