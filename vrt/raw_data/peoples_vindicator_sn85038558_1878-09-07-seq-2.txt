SPIRIT OF 1874. th
Our people will remember with in- it3
dignation-nay, madness-the causes
which led to the splendid and blood- o
less revolution of 1874. They will pr
ever hold in scorn and abhorence lei
those miscreants who perpetrated in el
the name of law deeds of plunder t
and outrage which would shame a lo
tyrant. a
That glorious revolution, born in at
Natebitoches parish, served as an es- fa
ample to our citizens throughout the b
State, and right well did they emu- s
late it. That revolution resulted in
the establishment in January, 1877, c,
after a contest which will be marked
in history as the moat glorious civic c6
effort ever known, of the Nicholl's
government. The government of a
LAW, the government of ORDER, si
the government of LIBERTY and of I
the WHITE RACE in Louisiana. t
For two years has this government
been in existence, dealing justice and a
equity to all without regard to ram p
or creed. It is to-day the living. a
breathing promies of the Demoeratic
whites of Louisiana sad the South -
that all should enjoy equal and ex
act rights.
How has that government been re- e
ceived tl
In gladness and rejoicing by the t1
whites, because it has given peace and t
.quiet to all our interests. But the ne- d
groesas a mass are blind to every a
true and noble instinct. They refuse I
to accept, at least In this parish, good
government. They denounce the l
punishment of petty thieves of their a
color as an outrage on their race. o
They would trample justice under a
foot. They know no law but license. d
They demand to do as they please
without moral restraint.
After all that we have suffered
from their former leaders; after we
have proven them, even to the ,
most prejudiced, as plunderers and t
liars unworthy of confidence; these s
negroes at their mere beck and call '
again attempt to place in power those
whom the virtue of this State most
abhor.
White men, in th conservatism of I
their nature, and because their inter
eset require it, submit to a great
deal, but this is too much to ask of
them, We are getting disastaed with
the negro as a mass. (There as some
who are good mad aoble, however.) 1
The whites are tired of preebilea and I
talking, of begging saod praying to c
them to be honorable, sad act as gopod
and deeat eitiseas; we have sicken

support hosorable, hoaset, and caps.

quarantine.
We are not astonished that certain
classes in New Orleans should feel
angered at the action of the country
people in quarantining rigorously all em
goods, passengers, &c., coming from
that city. But we are not prepared I
for such abuse and villification as the dn
Times indulges in, nor for the stupid bu
action of the Chamber of Commerce hu
in its long string of resolutions. We cli
desire to state to these parties, that apy
not only the health of the people of p
this section, but their future prosper- th
ity depends upon a rigid quarantine. oO
The Chamber of Commerce is a a,
merchantile association depending tv
upon and working for the business hr
I prosperity of New Orleans. They at th
P least should have known that in the co
o event of the breaking out of yellow pa
r tever in the Red river valley the cot- di
ton and corn crop would be a total ca
loss. Every white person, not at ed
once stricken down, would at once to
u abandon all, while the negroes would w
follow their example in great num al
e bers. The growing and now matured
crops would be abandoned and in- fit
stead of being a benifit to the busi J'
ness of New Orleans we would be- is
r, come objects of her charity. n√Ω
d Malevolent abuse, and vulgar sar- i
I casm, such as the Times indulges in. h
serves, as the New Orleans Democrat
justly says, to anger our people. We
are ready with our means to aid the
t, suffering in the plague stricken city of
,f New Orleans but we do not propose S
to introduce the scourge in our midst
by way of sympathy for them. Vitu
peration only serves to render us ci
id more determined and the wiser peo- t
.. ple of the city would do well to have
Ic stop put to it.
Our Blishop to tihe lesce.
. Our noble Bishop has gone to Vicks
burg to aid the sick with his care, and ti
cheer the dying with his presence. ti
His conduct is truly noble and wor
thy of the days of Chivalry. He asks
e the prayers of his flock throughout d
I the diocee; will not those of every
Sdenomination ascend to the Thronela
of Heaven for the protection of his
Grace. He writes the Rev. Father c
e Dicharry as follows: I
Very Rev. Father-I will start to

successor there died this morning, two I
r other priests are sick. There is but
. one priest left and Bishop Elder, and y
two thousand sick. Pray for me, and

f FRANCIS X. LERAY,
Bishop of Natchitoches.
The DeSoto Democrat goes for
Doctor Potts, because the Doctor,
e who is a candidate for nomination for 8
id the legislature in his parish, won't r
a sign an agreement to advocate the f
ll voting by the citizens for two condi- i
dates for the legislature, the parish
being entitled to that number in the
s General Asembly. This is done to
overcome "single shots." Doctor
of Potte contends for "plumpers," and
were we s candidate there it seems,
Swe would take "some in onr'o.n" i

Our allicted sister cities demand of
us every sacritce. God, In his mercy

Scharity to those who stuffer. Our no-. 1

demand, and will visit each and eve

For eighteen months the multitudi- rev
notis and well dtsciplined army of Chal- the
dea had lain close seige to the beautifll rev
but doomed city of Jerusalem: gaunt the
hunger and white want was depicted on not

false prophets speaking in the interest of any

comnutnication with God, spurred the tai
soldiers up to further acts of bravery and the
R sacrifice, by announcing that the Egyp- gle
t ans were cotminft to their rescue with cot
troops and ntunitionsnof war. Thus these to
brave men sti uggled on in opposition to we
t the pro'phe'sy of that good and great to
tman Jeremniah, losing opportunities for of
compronmise, and witnessing their com- gr
N panions in arms fall day after day, in the ir
.din of battle. me
Harvest time was In early Summer, it rh
l came and past, and no relief was afford- be
it ed either of metn or means or hope, the en
long dry hot Summer days dragged their th
weary lengths al.,ng-and the Autumn mi

te Our text, we see, was occasioned by w
the departure of the glory of the Jews, of
out announced on this first autumnal at
ie Sabbath of the year, awakens in our J+
st minds many serious and sober thoughts. to
During the year now so rapidly gliding dl
' away, Satan has besieged many a pre- vi
is cious soul, the war has been fierce, the gi
] enemy has been brave, watchmen upon
the towers of Zion have sounded out the w
e warning voice, you have been told to ti
flee from the wrath to come and be saved be
from your sins, but the enemy has gone h
along the line whispering 0time enough s
yet, don't be alarmed, to-morrow, next
month, next year will be time enough to p
. call on the Lord for help," thus many t
have been deluded, many have procras- o
d tinated, and it is feared some have lost 5e
a. the Harvest, past the Summer, and gone I
down to the second death and fallen into k
r- the hands of the dread enemy. i
a But say many, "I have no fear that re
t death will come and find me still unpre- it
pared." The very fact that you have no ti
7 fear is the greatest cause of danger-as "
se long as Satan can keep you from fear, he i
is sure of your distrnction. He nrges J
nothing stronger than that you should
Br cast away fear. He exalts in your com- d
posure, and rejoices day after day as he a
sees the HIarvest is drawing to a close, re
O the Summer is nearly ended, and you ii
Shave no concern about your salvation. a
Si He is as much pleased at distroying a a
ut soul by lulling it to sleep as by urging t
d you on to open violation of Gods law. v
d The Summer is the perfection of the a
year, the trees are in full foliage, fi
thej rose (God's favorite flower) for n
he has made nearly five hundred va- n
rieties of it, flames out with divine ii
beanty-you have during the past Sum- '
mer whiled away many hours in ar- t
tistically arranging them into beautiful h
r boquets and rejoicing to place them on Il
mantle and centre table, that they might it
r, fill the room with their sweet odors and d
or gladden the hearts of family friends a
Our Summers are also the season of
t't malarial poisons and death-many eat a
he forbidden fruit, the sin of our first pa
I rents, and die-disease that had its root a
in some cold or cough of the past Win- 5
sh ter, in Sumoter puts forth the white blos- a

there had been no revivals there would

I the Christian Church started with a
- glorious revival: On the day of l'ente
i cost three thousand souls were converted CI
I to God, and this was followed by oth r Ce
o we iderfnl Ianifestations of God's power Wi
I to save multitudes. itt we have scores etl
Sof mien and women who have witnessed '"v

e trecions revivals, and who have been ,
moved by the Holy Spirits to turn from P
it their evil ways and seek God, not only
I. here this Summer past but at other places fol
t tud on former occasions. Through all
ir these seasons of revivals you have come
u my friends, and you are here to-day,
- living without God, and without a rea
ta sonable hope. on the way to Death and
s- the Judgment. "The Harvest is past, the
Summner is ended, and you are not save ."
d O, by the gooduess and mercy of our
I- Heavenly Father, and by the cross of
at Christ, let tie plead with you as one that
re loves your souls, to fly to .Jesus for help,
e- "For why will ye (lie." Do no' spend a

it fulness of this world, and then try to
es crowd into that ,ast, feeble, languishing, ,

at for the mind of an Arch Angel. The go
saddest thing on earth is a death-bed,
ty with a wasted life standing on one side ht
ns, of it, and an overshadowing eternity to
al standing on the other side of it, and no
hr .Jesus, no Saviour anywhere to comfort,
e. to console, to take care of-all gloomn-all
g darkness-all despondency. T'lhe lHar
e- vest has ended, the Summer is past and
te gone, and he is not saved, not saved.
)n Again our text is appropriate as a
we warning to all those who rely on further
to time to make peace with God. This has
1d been the cry of your lives, and thie ve
o hicle of distruction to many immortal
;h souls. What is time T Only a few mo
st ments snatched from eternity to make
o preparation to meet God. And again,
y there is time, for our time is not our
s- own, but belongs to God. Suppose I
st send my servant for the marketing and l
he he loiters away the tinle until the mar- 2i
to ket closes and returns :rnod says, "I had
no time," would hlie not justly deserve t
at rebuke. He had no time, it helongs to
e. me, and so the excllse that you have no1 4
no time to attend divine worship, or to
as "seek the Lord while lie may be found" 51
he is frivolous and "will not stand in the
as Judgment."
