Men addicted to Jarg, and who ob
ject to being Keeley cured, will be
interested in an old book recently
discovered in New York, which gives
the remedies used by Thomas Hub
bard. over a hundred years ago. for
the cure of drunkenness. Mr. hub
bard recommends soaking live eels
in wine, and then drinking the wine
as a positive cure for drinking. To
prevent one from becoming intoxi
cated while drinking he advises two
ounces each of white cabbage and
pomegranate juice boiled down with
one ounce of vinegar. l'ake an
ounce of this before you are going to
drink. and you can drink afterwards
as much and as long as you please.
For he who goes out to :"see a man'
between the acts he recommends
chewing a root of iris trogiotida.
This is warranted to disguiseo even a

Some time ago a Miss Gorman, of
I Kaneville, Ill., started a letter chain
asking for )ostage stamps for a char
itable purpose. The thing grew to
such proportions that appeal was
Iade to the papers to stop the nul
sance. by telling people that no more
acre wanted. For awhile there was
a let up in the business, but recently
letters began to come from England,
wither the chain had become extend
ed by some means, and now they are
piiing in at the rate of 5U0 letters a
uay. The little postotlice receives so
many, that they are a postive nui
sance. Some of the stamps are
marketable, and many of the letters,
it is said, contain small amounts of
money.
A Decorated Home.
A short time ago a lady in Paris
became violently insane on the street
and was sent to an asylum. Her
apartments in the rue Rambuteau
tine ones, for which she paid an an
cual rent of 2000 francs-were then
visited. An intolerable stench per
vaded them. The demented woman
had completely -"tinned" them with
empty sardine boxes, which emitted
the peculiar odor. There were four
cartsful of these odorous boxes. She
had slipped her mental grip opening
sardine boxes. If Limburger cheese
had bcen her fad, her secret would
have been let out sooner. It could
not have stayed in the room.

'he responses, which are from the

place the output for 1893 anywhere
from 400t,000 to 750),000, and that of

THE BOY OF SEVENTEEN.
l0e Needs the Aid of a kirm and Goll
Ing Iland
" The boy of 17 has reached a danger
Sous ace. Not merely because he has
, left the sheltering innocence of child
. hodl. and murt meet the temptations
a that every youth must sometimes face.
e The trouble is that he too often knows
o so much that his elders can teach him
little. II, feels prepared to settle all
th, (ltuestions of ethics or statesman
I1 hip off hand. I recall the anecdote of
1 that young law student, to whom the
n juidge before whom he was being ex
0 anmied for admission to the bar stated
s a lch:l case, and asked him how it
. -houli be decided.
V. it hoot a Inotllent's hesitation the

11 " N ;lin who is posted in common law
couol hesitate for a moment."
"Perhaps not." said the old judge
thioughtfully. "Only it caused a disa

his joyous enthusiasm and cheerful
view of things without an impulse to

I am not of those who would deny to
youth tlit natural pleasures that be

d
r Singular Faculty of a Kentucky Man of
° an InIdutriou, Turn.
Archibald Clark, a farmer living a
e few miles from Greenup, is without
d doubt the most remarkable somnam
d bulist in the state. During the past
summer he has been accusing his
neighbors of slipping into his truck
patches at night and cultivating them.
Of course he did not object to this, but
thought it most extraordinary. It was
also a strange fact that they always did
at night what he had intended to do
the following day. Becoming anxious
to know which of his neighbors he was
o indebted to for the kindness, he spent
many wakeful nights watching his
truck patches, but without success. No
one ever came into them when he was
d on the watch, but when h, would miss
watching for a night there was invari
ably some work done. A short time
ago be drove his wagon into his potato
* patch late one evening, so that he could
load it early in the morning. He was
very anxious to get well on his was to
market before sun-up. However, he
e overslept himself, and got up in a ter.
n rible stew; but great was his surprise
t1 when he went into the potato patch to
o find the wagon already loaded and
. horses hitched to it, ready to start, thus
a saving him a couple of hours' time and
r hard work. One night his wife saw him
o stealing out of the house in his night
clothes, and, following him to the barn,
saw him take a mattock and go out
and begin digging up grubs in an old
fence row. She then understood who
had been doing her husband's work.
HOW WOMANLIKE.
They Discuss Their Friend, But Woultda's
Say an Unkind Thing About Her.
After they had kissed each other and
each had disposed of a bonbon to show
that they met on friendly terms the
blonde said:
"So Mamie is married?"
"So I've heard," returned the brhu
nette.
"Nice girl," ventured the blonde.
"Oh, very," returned the brunette.
"I wouldn't say a word against her
for the world."
"Neither would I. How do you sup
Spose she ever got him?"
"I'm sure I don't know. Do you?"
"No; I would give anything to know."
"So would I. It certainly wasn't her
t beauty."
"Oh, no."
a "Or her cleverness."
"The idea is absurd."
S"I can't understand it at all. They say
Sshe was married first by a justice and
Safterward by a minister."
"I shouldn't wonder. She naturally
wanted to make awfully sure of him."
"Of course. It's the only way she
i could keep him. But I am glad she hu
1 caught some one. Mamie is a dear girl
Sand it would be cruel to say anything
against her."
* "Indeed it would. I wouldn't do it
for the world."
"Neither would I."

Whipping Post Wanted.
Some of the little legal minds ofi
Washington, where statesmen meet to
talk tariff, obstruct business and ne
gotiate for offices, have actually pro
posed to introduce a whipping-post
for wife beating, chicken stealing
and other petty crimes, in the District
of Columbia, the seat of our govern
ment. 'T'ue idea is the invention of a
grand jury, and Judge Bradley, when
informing them that it was not their
business to make such propositions,
indorsed it at the same time, and reo
ommended that it be proposed to con
gress, adding that, in his opinion, it
would be the most effective means of
Istopping a number of petty crimes
Swith which, under present circum
I stances, the courts of Washington are
unable to deal. The institution ex
ists in Delaware, but as the crimes
for which it was intended have rap
idly disappeared, it has fallen into dis
use. Of course this punishment is
intended for those small, outside peo
ple who rob the White Hlouse hen
roost, but if the lash, brutal as it
may be, could be made to cover the
backs of statesmen who rob the treas
ury, accept bribes and say things in
speeches that are not so, it might do
some good.
Deafness Can Not Be Cured
By local applications, as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear.
There is only one way to cure detfness,
and that is by constitutional remtedies.
SDeafness Is caused by an Inflamed con
I dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachlan Tube. When the tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
Simperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed Deafness is the result, and
Sunless the inflammation can be taken
out and this tube restored to its normal
I condition, hearing will be destroyed for
ever; nine cases out of ten are caused
by Catarrh, which is nothing but an In
flamed condition of the mucous sur
faces.
