What the Democratic I~ouse has a
Done. c
ti
The Radical press and politicians in 0
their efforts to discredit the Demo "
cratic party are constantly making ill C
natured and unjust flings at the D)e
mocratic House of Representatives.
This is perhaps not unnatural, for as
the old adage has it, "drowning men e
will catch at straws." The New York !
Express gives the following synopsis t'
of the work accomplished by the pres
uet Democratic House in the few I
monlhs since. it met : i
1. It has not elected a Speaker like ti
Schuyler Colfax, who used his high i'
office to enrich himself. It has not
not elected a Speaker like James G. v
Blaine, who, used his position to in
A Ue o Tl A6titjoa in fatvor Q:rail
agent of a fire arms company, who n
sold rulings and legislation-for so
much cnsh down in the shape of rail- n
-md bonds. o
2. Since it met last December it c
has not been devising ways and i,
means, day after day, to get money (
out of the Treasury. On the con- 1
trary, it has eat down the extrava- s
gant estimates of the departments, c
and if the Senate will pass its bills,
has reduced the running expenses of w
the Government nearly forty millions
of dollars per annum. Instead of f
making places for tihe creatures of the ,
administration, it has abolished every e
office that was not absolutely neces- ti
sary. t
3. It has not legislated a freedman's 1
bank into existence and placed it in j,
the power of a lot of men to steal the (1
savings of the poor colored men of v
the South, amounting to millions of a
dollars. On the contrary, it has a
taken the robbers and swindlers who (
did that Infamous work by the throat, d
exposed their rascality and direeted t
the officers of the Government to send a
their names before the grand juries. t
4. It has gone into President Grant's a
Cabinet and dragged out of it one of e
his trusted advisers who abused his e
high place, who robbed the dead vet- c
erans of the war, who aided in cheit- I
ing the living soldiers on the plains,
who demanded money for every ap
pointment he made, and brought him
to trial for his nbanycerimes.
5. It has shown [low the funds of '
the so-called department of justice '
have been used for the purpose of I
controlllng elections in the South and,
in the North ;" how the President put I
his hand into the public treasury and
took oat money to aid in hit own re
election. It has exposed the villany of
Williams,, thl rascality of Davenport,
and tihe general corruption of that en
tire branch of the public service.
6. It has stretched its hand across
the water to London and saved the
ionor of the country by collaring the
minister and embanssdor eztraordin
ary, who was using his influence as
our representative to "bell" a worth
less mining stock and rob the English
people.
S7. It bas attered the Distriet of
Columbia Rilk into a thousand atoms;
indicted Babcock for complicity with
safe burglars, made Harrington a fg
itive from justiee, and exposed the
rottenness and corrupilon of the pres
ent commissioners.
8. It has Instituted'a rigid serutiny
Into the management of the Navy
Department, exposed the corrupt op
eratioos of the Cattells and other
plunderers.
9. It has laid bare the straw sys
tem in the Pot (ds0 Department
and proved that the eountry ·has been
annually robbed of hundreds of thou
sands of dollars for carrying letters
which were never written over routes
that never had an existence.
10. It hasesxposied the nfasmies of

THE RADICAL PLOT.
How it is Proposed to Perpetu
ate the Grant Dynasty
Jere Haralson Discloses Otti* a Part a
of the Programme.
Correspondence of the St. Louis Times. I
I Washington, July 26.-Considera
ble attention has been given a speech
!made at Selma, "Alabama, by Jere I
|laralson, a colored member of Con. I
gress from that State, and also the
representative of Alabama on the
National Republican Committee. lit
the course of his speech Mr. Haralson I
declared that "if the Democrats car- t
ried Mississippi the Senate would not
count the vote of that State in the
electoral college." He then added
that "lie had been talking with Senla- I
tors and knew what lie was saying."
Probably Mr. Haralson in his zeal "
to fire the colored heart became
slightly indiscreet, but he told the I
truth) nevertheless. He did not,
however, tell the whole truth, be
cause lie only indicated a part of the e
programme. I will give the whole I
plot as it has been known to exist for I
some time, premising with the re
mark that it originated in the once
fertile brain of Blaine.
TilE RADICAL PLAN.
Some nlonths ago the Republican
leaders in Washington became antis
fled that nothing short of an interpo
sition of fate would save their party a
in the approaching Presidential con f
test. The House had gone on from
exposure to exposure, each new one
more damaging than its predecessor, e
and when the whole record of infamly
culminated in the wreck of Belknap, i
there was an absolute panic. The
only man in the councils of the party it
who held his grip was Blaine. Blaine
called his faithful followers together t
and laid before thenm the scheme by t
which lie proposed to AVert the ruin
that threattened the Republican par
ty, and that was nothing less than
the plot to revolutionize the country .r
in the manner inutimated by Ilaaulson t
in his Sehlma speech. Blaine is coin
paratively dead now, but his deeds
live after him, and his pious Inven- I
tion to revolutio,nize the nation and 1
prevent the execution of the popular t
will is in a particularly acute state of t
vitality.
WORKING it OUlt
,..a 9 Ilblln 'ýýýfttlrdth nre &ntift have t
more than thirty majority in the r
electoral college, and probably not
more than eighteen ; that in order to
obtain a majority at all they must I
carry the States of Louisiana, Miss
issippi, Arkansas and Northi Carolina.
It is conceded by the Republican
leaders that the votes of all these
States will be returned for the Demo- I
cratic electoral ticket But it is their I
intention to flood the Northern States
with stories of rapine and outrage, e
and thus prepare the Northern mind I
for the spectacle of revolution. It t
will be remembered that when the I
electoral vote was counted in 1872, a
that of Louisiana was objected to and I
thrown out, and was never counted. t
This is a precedent. Under the 22d
joint rule, if either House objects to t
the counting of any State, that State's
vote must be suspended, pending ex
amination into the validity of the (
objection. There is nothing in the I
Constitution or the laws to limit the
duration of such examination nor is 1
there any barrier against frivolous
and unfounded objection. Thus, if(
the Senate objectto counting the votes t
of the four Sonthern States mention- I
ed and tlhey are suspended from the
electoral college, pending inquiry, it
will be easy to prolong the inquiry
beyond the 4th of March following.
A PAVORABLE SITUATION.
The consequences of this action
are easy to be seen. Grant will still
be in the White Nouse with all the
execuntive forces of thes nation in his
grasp. His party will hold thei Sea
ate. The Democratic House of the
present Congress will expire bly law,
and there will be no barrier between
the Republicans and the accomplish
ment of their desperate designs.-
There will be no President elected,
and .the Senate will declare Grant 1
provisional President until a sececa
tmr can be legally chosen. Thle new
House of Representatives will be
convoked and will be organized on a
Republican basis, precisely as De
Trobriand organized thie Louisiana
Legislature two years ago. After
that the Republicans will have the
gae in their own hands and may
Stake whatever steps they please to
reconstruct thIe Goveromento
WILL NEVER sUIIRRND3E.
This in brief is the settled pro
Sgramne of tihe desperate rogues and
eriminals who hold the reins of Iow
er at this time and who are deter
Smined never to surrender the Gov.
erinmen to their political opponents
unless the verdiet of theim people
Sanaoinst them shall be nso utterly over
w7hellining as to preclude the possi
b;ilitj of a successful revolution.
Had the Democratic majority in the
present House been eighteen or twen
ty instead of nearly eighty, as at
tempt would lhave been made tiAroughl
Sthe ageiley of McPberson; tJtl old
clerk, to seat a Republican majority,
and the arrangemeuts to that end hIad
all been made. But the November
t election swept away the hopes of the
Sconspirators, and they ab udo0ed
their design. This too, was a scheme
of Blaine.
e A TI/MLY WARNING,
m I presume most people will senut
n these abthing as MlIpoes.ble, and de
l. onace im as an alarmist. But just
a that pRopnsity to uoder-rte danger
- sad iee&to provide aginst It, is
v what rwIll mske revo lu Ieasys of
rt .aonismmt when it is op f epltted
upon the people.. If Mr. Tilden
should carry eilongfli Northern States
to elect him, without the votes of
Louisiana, Miaissisipi, Arkansas and
North Carolina, he will be the next
President. But if he does not, then
hie will never get into the White
House without going in there at the ,
head of a force of citizens soldiery
sufficient to overcome all the resour- J
ces of the present Administration.
You will hear more of this matter 4
by and by. A. C. B.
RoBBED LOUISIANA.-We read im
the New York Sun Jndge Abell, of I
Louisiana, says that during the past I
eight years more money hi. been
stolen from the State Treasgry by of- I
ficers of the Government than has i
been stolen in the same State by all
the unofficial thieves, robbers and
burglars who have operated in Louis
iana during the whole time since it º
was purchased from the French. It ,
is doubtful; however, if this state
ment gives an adequate idea of the
enormous extent of the robberies
whicl have beet, committed upon the
people of Louisiana; , and the North
emrn creditors of that State who in
vested in her securities. It is not an I
exaggeration to say that one hundred
millions in gold would fail to com
pensate for the robberies and injuries
that have been inflicted upon Louis-.
iana by the villainous politicians who <
have been kept ii, power by Grant's
illegal use of Federal troops when i
they had been defeated at the poles. I
The' same parties expect to repeat
their work of fraud in November, and t
to again nullify the VolCe of the peo
as expressed through the ballot box,
for they know very well that they
cannot elect their candidates by fair
means. It remains to be seen wheth
er the United States army can again
be used to aid in the spoliation of an i
impoverlshed State which is exceed- I
ingly rich in natural resources, but t
fis been at the mercy of brigands a
for years, with President Grant at
their back to encourage and snstain t
them in their work.

Hayes endorses the platform which
entdoises Grant. This platform was
made by Grant's office holders, and
when they say reform the country
knows they mean it. They say they C
have always been in favor of reform. c
They have ahleady reformed every
thing within their reach and they in
tend to coutinae the business if let
alone. Grant has now 94,119 office
holders in his employ. Mr. Lincoln
during the, most ..trozlltsomne ariod
ted civil service, did all the necessa
ry work with 47,325 office holders,
but Grant, the reforomer, ill a time of
peace, keeps double as many as Mr.
Lsncoln had. I
Good material is furnished to the i

Farm nid o~isehold,
The Wastes on the FarrM
Alex. Hyde, in the New York Times,
has the following remarks on a sub
ject of much importance:
What to do with the waste water
of the sink and wash tub is one of the
problems of the country life which is
not fully solved. It is too valuable
to be lost, and too unhealthy to be
kept near the honse. To throw it as
many do, from the kitchen door, and
leave it there to contaminate the air,
is temptitg the grim messenger Death
to shoot his fatal arrows, If death
should ensue, there should nothing be
said about the mysterious Providence
The only mystery is that more sick
ness and death do not result from the
malarious atmosphere of the surface
cesspool.
Probably the best mode of ridding
the premises of miasm from sinks in
to conduct the waste water in iron or
cement pilpes to a cesspool solie dis
tance from the house, and keep this
pool well filled with some absorbent,
such as dry muck, fine charcoal, or
loam. The sink itself should be of
iron, and furnished with a valve out
let, so that the gasses from the pipes
cannot return into the house. A
wooden sink is apt to become satu
rated with the odors generated in the
pores of the wood. If wood most
be used for sinks, use a solution of
copperas frequently to keep them
wholesome.
Another great source of miasm oh
the farm is the privy. If this is
within the farm house, as it should
be for the comfort of the woMmen the
vault should not be neglected for one
day during the warm weather. If
barrel of dry earth or sifted eoal ash
es is placed conveniently to the vault,
with a scoop in it, and each person
cover ste daily deposit with the dirt
or ashes, the privy will give no oc
casion of offonce or disease, and a
big amount will be added to the fer
tilizers of the farm. A morn con
venient and systematic mode is to
adopt the earth-closet plan, and put
the sifted dirt or ashes in a box which
operates automatically each time the
closet is usned. Indeed, an earth
closet has become almost an essential
part of household furniture. It is
murch better than a watcr-closct for a
farm house, inasmuch as the fertili
zing material can be utilised. The
expense of an earth (closet is smalli
ibeuhj l'ltw 1Cn5 u `'din np.EsIaoia.
much richer than barn yard manure,
as the food of man is richer than that
of beast-is also prignSlant with the
seeds of disease if allowed to decom
pose and send off its gases into the
air. The farmer, therefore, whoi
neglects his privy is guilty of great
neglect of the health of his family
and the fruitfulnes of his farm.
The barn yard and pig sty are also
often the valises of tninlstu nudl death
on tie farm. They should not be
too near the ihonse. To quarter time
cows and pigs right under the kitch
en windows, as we have often seen
dpne, indicates a want &of taste as
well as good seice. Them is a!plaee
for everything, and the place for the
pig pen is just as far from the house
as convenience will allow, and wher
ever it may be it should be kept well
littered with some absorbent. With
a large lot of hogs, the pens in July
and August are apt to become a nuis
ance to a wide extent of teyritory,
unless tholoughly eared fok The
hogs themselves isuffer, as well as the
famdly, if not kept'clean and coater
table. It is all a mistake to suppose
that a hog does not know a bed of
leaves from a bed of mad, and had
as lief lie in one as the other. In a
hot day he may take to thie mad to
cool himslelf from the effects of his
superibundetrfat, but he is too mech
of a gentleman to be dirty, if lie caMn
