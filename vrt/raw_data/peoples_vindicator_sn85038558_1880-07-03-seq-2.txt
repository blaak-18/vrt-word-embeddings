I to oppose' that man's return to Con- nil
grey. and Mdipted the following rr
solutone. which should be carefully 1
read and digested by every voter: eel
Therefore, Be it by this nldpen- co
dent conveution of the epublcas
of the Nineteenth congressional die- dei
drict of Ohio resolved, sit
First-That dishonesty, fraud and aLt
oorruption have become so common,
r notorious and obvious in the admlia
Sleitratl6n of our national government. th
as to be not only humiliating and A.
disgraceful in the esimation of every far
I honest and intelligent citizen, but to in1
3 imperil the prosperity of tile peoiple, o
I it not the stability of the goverment cit
t itself. 101i
Second-Resolved, that this deplo- cli
I rable condition of the administra* tic
r tlon of our natignal government is ..
V largely due to the election to office
and continuance therein of corrupt
a dishonest and venal men.
- Resolved that It Is useless and by
. pooritical for any political party to
a declare fot reform In i platforms,
a s and public addi while It
it Slts 'O roturalts to bhlh o8flial ia
a place and power men who have been
notoriously connected with the very
. achemes of fraud which render re
a form necesssay and urgent; that to
I- read those to enact reform who
-* themselve need reforming to make wl
1. them honest, Is worse than ettring an
I- thd blind to lead the blind. ian
is Fourth-Resolved, that there is no be
rt man to-day offoally connected with -
g the administration of our national
- government agJnat whom are justly
I- preferred more and graver charges of
e Caorruption than are publicly. made fri
'* and abundantly sustained against ti
SJames. reld the present repr el
as sentative of this Congressional di D
Is trict and the nominee of the Repub- so

Is Fifth-Resolted, that since he Ast
'e entered Congress to this day there is
s" searcely san ntane in which rlngs Dl
a and monopolies have been arrayed
against the interests of the people.
Is that he has been found Rotive in
se speech or vote upon the side of the
I latter, butin almost even case he wi
rf has been the rsad champion of the es
F rng and monopolies.
ba SVth-Resolvod that we especial- 81
