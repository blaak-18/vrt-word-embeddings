THE. GREAT GOO PAN Jennie Harris Oliver
I. .
HE lone little figure in
the old carryall started at
a sudden mutter of thun
der, mingled with the
measured tramp of horses ’
hoofs along the highway.
“Evenin’, ma’am! Goin’
to have some rain!”

Caine a raucous voice, as
the hoofbeats came to a flourishing
halt under the sheltering sycamores.
The rider, a heavy man of fifty, swung
off his wide felt hat disclosing a shin
ing globe of cranium ornamented
about the neck with a grizzly fringe
of hair.
“Ma name’s Thorndyke, ma’am—
agent here —and you, I take it, are
Mrs. Westmere. Hear your husband
speak of me, I’m sure. Better of your
fever?”
“Yes, thank you. Coming all the
way from the coast up this breezy
hill has made me nearly well again.”
The woman’s voice was low and
winning, but her blue eyes held in
their softness something humorous
and almost daring. The agent studied
her eyes.
“Well,” he said, shifting his bulky
figure in the saddle, “I suppose I
should say I’m glad to see you here,
but”—
“Oh, yes, the objection! It was
kind of you to tell us frankly about
it,” laughed Mrs. Westmere, “and
nothing but my ill health would have
tempted us to brave such an obstacle.
But then I am not nervous and super
stitious as most sick women are, and
to get this fine, airy location, even
with the —the encumbrances, in ex
change for our marshland, upon which
northern people should have known
better than to locate in the first place,
was a wonderful chance, you must
admit. Tom says they are going to
raise rice there as he intended to un
til I got ill. He might have made it
alone, but I couldn’t live there, and
after doctors’ bills took our money we
couldn’t go back home. You see we
really hadn’t much choice in the mat
ter. ’ ’
“Well, I admire your pluck, I do
that. But you’re not the first wom
an I’ve seen come here in fine spirits
—brave as a lion”— the agent paused
significantly. “But ’tis a fine place,”
he went on, “most sightly in the coun
try. Used to be valued at many thou
sands before the tragedy. Year by
year, since then, I’ve seen it go stead
ily down, till I’ve sometimes thought
the time would come when I couldn’t
give it away.”
He turned a speculative eye upon
the old deserted garden behind the
sycamores. It was still sweet with the
spring musk of hundred-leaf roses;
lush with flowering currants, and
gray-green with moss and myrtle.
There was a soft purling of water in
the ruined fountains, and a flight of
swallows clouded about the old stone
house that, long and gray, high and
irregular, peered out with troubled
eye-windows, gloomy and forbidding.
Suddenly the low, red sun flared
under the drooping branches and lit
its many mullioned panes with a be-
wildering, crimson gdeam, and from
the tall ivy-clasped chimney, built
ruggedly up the outside of the right
wing, poured a wavering line of down
dropping smoke. As the visitor sur
mised, Westmere was inside making
things “fit.” He now appeared
disheveled with cobwebs and soot,
shook hands with Thorndyke and
apologized to his wife for his long
delay.
“Been skeerin’ off the spooks,” he
explained, laughing heartily.
“Yes, as I was just telling your gal
lant little woman here, I am not ex
actly pleased to see you make the ven
ture, and I’ll be honest about it. You
see” —the man paused and directed
a long, solemn glance at the build
ing—“there’s more things on earth
than the wisest can explain, and this
thing has become the terror of the
countryside. There’s not a man,
woman or child in miles, that would
step his foot over your threshold for
love or money. Outsiders may scoff
at the thing, but it’s there —the
strangest, most unaccountable music,
ever since the poor woman turned
from the organ to meet her doom at
the hands of her husband! Her life
went on into the unknown, but the
music she played— it lives on!”
Thorndyke finished with an eloquent
wave of his pudgy hand.
“Yes, and by Jiminy, I heard it,
too!” laughed Westmere, “though
I’ve no doubt but what we’ll soon dis
cover the source. Yes, Mr. Thorn
dyke, we’ll lay that ‘hant,’ never
fear. Won’t you come in awhile?”
“No, not tonight, and I must be
getting on or the rain will catch me.
Be over in the morning. Good luck.”
As the old man wheeled his horse
the first big drops spattered heavily
in the white dust of the road, and
Westmere gathered his wife in his
arms and ran through the tangled
shrubbery and up the stone steps that
terminated in the widest and dimmest
of halls, where a carved stairway
curved upward in the gloom. Turn
ing to the right, he carried her into
a big, oak-ceiled room to a couch
by the wide fireplace, where a leaping
blaze was fast driving out the must
and damp. Then he ran out and, hur
riedly stabling the horse, swung in
with a bucket of fresh water dipped
from the bubbling fountain in the
garden.
“This is great after all, Winnie,”
he said boyishly, “a little tangled
and messy, but as soon as you can be
about we’ll have no end of fun cut
ting and slashing in that wilderness
of roses, won’t we?”
“Yes, indeedy, Tom. I am almost
well now: I want some supper.”
“Glory, but I’m glad, honey. Sure
grateful to that ‘bant,’ without
which we couldn’t have touched the
price in a hundred years. We’ll just
settle that disturbance in the morn
ing—simplest thing in the world, I
am sure. These country people are
easily hoaxed, you see, but not your
‘uncle Thomas.’ First, we’ll lay the
ghost, then we’ll look after the flesh
pots; strawberry short cake, lettuce
and peas, thick cream for our coffee,
and ‘frying si^e’-the year around.

Picture it, think of it”—
“I’d rather sample it, you crazy
boy. If you don’t want me to starve,
hurry, hurry.”
Tom sniffed importantly at his
steaming pot of coffee and unpacked
the hamper of crisp fried chicken and
buttered biscuits with much satisfac
tion. It would be good to see Win
nie eat, and call things good again.
But it was as strange a meal as
ever tried the nerves of two lone
householders, with the rain lashing
the windows, the wind breathing
heavily, like a great animal in its
sleep, and intermingled and closely
woven with it all, the wild, wailing
music, that sometimes drove the color
from their cheeks and made them
reach for each other’s hands.
“Great guns, girl, but this is aw
ful!” cried Westmere, at last, his
teeth fairly chattering. “Nothing
but the wind behind some loostened
paper, of something like that, but it’s
fierce while it lasts.”
He took his wife’s frail form in his
arms and sat all night by the fire
place while the strange music seemed
to fight a duel with the storm; some
times arising piercingly triumphant ;
sometimes softened to the low, deep
notes of heart-hunger, protest and
pain. Again, like a chorus of far
away singers, it chanted hauntingly
ere trembling away into chords long
drawn-out and indescribably mourn
ful.
Winnie named the mysterious play
er the “Great God Pan,” and said
she knew the rabbits and swallows
were close to the rain-swept windows
—drawn by the magic tones.
But all things have an end, and
with the morning light the storm and
the music died together, and the
house grew very still, save for a drift
of golden notes that floated like per
fume through the old, dust-gray
rooms.
Agent Thorndyke found Westmere
serving coffee on the big front ve
randa, where his wife sat smiling ov
er her lap full of crimson, velvety
roses. One could not tell whether he
were disappointed or otherwise, but,
judging by his puzzled expression, it
was not what he expected.

Winnie gained so rapidly in the
next few weeks that ghost-hunting
finally grew irksome, and while her
husband pried into ceilings and rum
maged in the ratty, musty basement,
she flew ecstatically about the now
orderly rose domain, or flaunted her
pink, frilly morning frock around a
flock of fluffy, yellow chicks in the
sunny rear garden. Westmere grew
vain of her firm, red cheeks and she
had all faith in his ability to stop
the chanting mystery, so for a time
things went on very well.
The fatal organ, which both secret
ly suspected, was exchanged with a
peddler for bright new tinware. The
peddler preferred “rags,” but had
to be content with promises for the
future.
Thorndyke, who was an almost
daily visitor, sometimes assisted in
the ghost hunt; inclining to the be-
lief that the thing lurked in the base
ifaent. So he followed Westmere
heavily down the dim stairs, wallowed
in mold and cobwebs and came up a
comical spectacle—something, Tom
said, like a China pig who had been
disporting himself according to the
manner of the real article. Finally,
like an overstrained fiddle-string,
Westmere’s patience snapped. It
wasn’t altogether that he was dis
tracted morning, noon and night—es
pecially when the wind soughed eerily
through the fartherest nooks and
crannies—by this weird web of sound;
but he was by nature a straightfor
ward, sociable creature, and the ab
sence of neighbors worried him.
He fancied that their own friendly
little calls about the neighborhood
were unwelcome, and he knew that
the darkies looked askance at him
as the “man dat lived in dat cunju’d
house.” And now that his wife was
well, he saw no reason for prolonging
the situation. He began to urge the
expediency of turning the place back
to the agent for a moderate sum and
renting somewhere else, and to Win
nie’s consternation, when she opposed
the plan, grew as cross as a bear.
“We’ll leave here if I have to w’ork
like the meanest Dago that ever
lived,” he told her finally. “I’m
no blooming spectre, and I don’t
care to associate with one. Os
course any sane man knows it’s just
a trick —someone knocking against
us to bring the price to their beggar
ly purses. I’ve an idea that Thorn
dyke knows all about it, but how are
you going to make him tell?”
And then he rode away to look at
farms, while Winnie —not being of the
crying kind —turned her attention
from roses and chickens, and all day
long and every day, flew up and
down stairs in endless research.
It was a matter of the utmost im
portance now, for the beauty of the
place had got into her blood. Some
times —with a tender look into the
future —she saw little feet patter “all
aloney” into the long, shining hall, or
toddle about among the roses, to
clutch ami shriek at the darting hum
ming birds, and wallowing bumble
bees. But while her zeal more than
equaled her husband’s in opposite
plans, he was the more successful, and
came home one evening, almost bois
terously elated, with his quest at an
end.
And he didn’t intend dallying, eith
er; he said so plainly and firmly.
The thing had got on his nerves
and he would put an end to it as soon
as they could drive over in the morn
ing, after fixing up the papers with
Thorndyke. He talked constantly all
through supper—which he declared
was their last in that “beastly house,”
and tried to enthuse his wife with a
graphic description of their new
home; but for once in their brief mar
ried life, Winnie was glad when he
was in bed and fast asleep. <She lay
for a long time, dry-eyed and thought
ful, watching the moonlight throw
wavering vine shadows on the wall
listening to the soft sigh of the wind
in the sycamores; then arising she
