In view of the publiatlon of Major

deem It prop, In the abeooce of

The value of the local newspaper I
to a commonlty has been admitted lT
from tine Immemorial. and we Mae bl
glad tobeable to ote some of the th
good effects of our thunder. We O
commeneed on the Grand Eobre
bridge, and it has been put In good hi
condition; we warmly advocated the b
establishment of an lo factory, anad
are happy to state we are to have l1
one. That enterprising oltizen Mr. F. th
- McDaniel has setth ball in motion,
aid the machinery will arrive hero
noe week. We hope our citizens O
generally wl n e ol that Mr. Mo- t
Daniel reaps the reward of his en*
terpruis. It enterprises like this are
not encouraged, capital will bo sunk Is
a out of lght; and ltabtohl es ill t

B Encouraged by the saccss which w
crowned our o ts I these two In.
stauuese, we now dip our or be.
"bhal of another sad very desirable t
Improvement, namely, the establlsh*
Smot of a tlphoe between her
d ad Grand Ecom. The beeIt of e
this to our meuchants and buiness -
men generally isvery apparnt. Mr. a
TJob Shepard, our tlegra opemai

Sragement. Let us qoourage .hm by
rh all mesas; all mhouldunlte in every.

Blit may eost us something at the

ILLING AT MARSHALL.
Mr. Bart Jeulup, Prepoieter of the _
lesaesger Sheets satd ll Hllan.
W. S. elemams.
The. priculars, as we learned
them, says the Shreveport Standard.
are about as follows: After reading
the artlole Mr. Coleman armed him
self sad went In search of the editor, .B
and ondlog him demanded to know
It he was reponsible for the article.
The editor dlsolalmea any respoel*a
bility, statinr that Mr. Jeaninga was
the responslble party. Mr. Cole
turned and walked sway and when
opposite Twyman & Womack's store
he met Mr. Jennings and accosted
him thus: "B irt, .re you respoanli
ble for the article which appeaded in
the Messenger thi mornlng ?" Be
oelifl an afirmative answer he re
Iled that it was an infamous lie. At
thlc juncture tnthl gentlemen drew
their plstol.. ý, began firlng upon
each other. ioe eight or teo shots
were fired, three of which struck Mr.
* Coleman, one in the left breast, near A
t the heart, another In the sabdomen
and the the third in the thigh. The par. E
ties were some eight or ten feet apart
when the shooting began. After the E
I shooting Mr. Coleman walked, or
I tred a few feet and fell dead.
Sr leannings surrendered blhmself D
to the authorities. A bystander, and
a stranger nto Marshall, was severely
b wounded to the knee from a stray 0
. shot, sad boy Is reported to have
been shot to the arm.
J There Is a difference of opinion as t
iL to who, Bred the first shot, some I
" elaimlns that Mr. Jeonnings fired first p
a while Mr. Coleman was la the act
of drawing his pstol, while others
I claim that the lttter began s ing
Sirst. It is a most deplorable air, .
y* and we deply smplthe with he=
triendsa d ielm ofs both gentle
t, men.
