The piecie mas he stands:
3A ,.eful looking ilan is he,
With bruises and grimuy hands :
And the soil that stick to his trouser's

Is the soil of several lands.
His hair is mussed, his lest is torn,
His clothes are like the ground ;
lie wishes he had ne'er been born,
a Or bCeing horn ne'er fomund.
liht glares anid sowls in wrathful scorn
A- oft lie looks around.
- At early morn, ill snit of white
He sought the pienic park ;
h iiHis face waclean, his heart was light,
e Ills loud song mocked the lark.
e BHt now although the day is bright
Hlis world, alas! is dark.
In joyouni imeol, at early morn,
He sat upon the stump,
SBut soon, as though upon a thorn
He mat. with mighty jump
He lealed aloft, and all forlorn
In haste he did crump.
For lo, in hordes the big black sats,
With nippers long aedl slim,
Went swittly crawling up his pants,
And made it warm ftborhim ;
And through the woods they made him

With gasp, and groan, and vim.

They cannot hear the words he cried J
"ad fetch! dog gone! dad bring!'
And now he wisheth he were down, j
And yet he emnot see,
Just how the giggle, stare and frown
Escaped by hi may be ;
He knows he cannot scramble down r
With his back against the tree. ii
Sobbing, and sidling, and wailing, 6
Homeward alone he goes ;

Deep li the foundation of a mother's
nA Me. re rrity is like that of "the
to wet perfulime that beiathes upon a

it speaks its tenderness. There is a
he language in a mother's smile, but it
uj. betrays not all her nature. I have
s'k sometimes thought while gazing on
re her countenance, its dignity slightly
eir changed by the sweet accents of her
. young child a, it repeated some en
er. dearing word, that the sanetuary of a

Al, 'pirit that strengthens the bonds of

4 to break from a dream even when
d affliction is on you. You are assured ,
i thalt you have at least one friend ;
re and that liend is a true one. At
. suech a time, you can read more fully
ia mnother's feelings than her tongue
,d can express them. The anxiety with
. which she gazes upon you, the ten
d dernese with "hich she sympathises I
,, with you, the willinguess with which
1e she supplies your wants, all serve to I
k represent the secrets woikings of her
it heart. But a mloser's love is un
w ceasing. Who than can lojk coldly
a upon a mother t Who, after the on

if a an his supporters made the history of I
old their 8 years of power, there was under
Ily, them a decenter regard than under
it Hqyes for tile rules o common honesty
a in the conduct of the publi business.
of We did not have under Grant any such
ike naublashiun attempt to force or purchase
I a nominalion for the Presidency as we 1
now see in the case of Sherman. This
on officer is actually collecting motey open. a
Is l.y from his snbordinates to help elect
len Foster ia Ohio, and that ahfer having
ad announced himself as a Presidential ean
d; didate, and basing his hopes of oonre,
At on the support of Ohio. This will see t
Ils to plain people one degree meaner and b
more corrupt than to buy an office with
t one' s own money. ti
The force of evil association is shown'
n In the ase of MeCrary. He wse, I be -
Im lieve, the most scrupulous of the polioi
ci cians who went into the Hayes Cabinet,
to but nominated for a high judicial pi
Ier tion lately, and fearing, I think without
cause, that he would not be' confrnied,
he is now deliberately and openly tra- d
ding or attempting to trade the patron- ft
age of his present :pbition for Demo- T
eh cratic Senatorial support. I
'7 It was slid that Grant packed the 8u
id preme Court to secure a certain decision.
r. Under Devun, as Att'y Gon'l, we have U
to had. upon questions that bore upon po.
er litical matters, more contradictory opan
d ions than would fill a volume. i'tt
would come the straight forward and d
t fai construction of law, and aftetwards Bi
the political emergency arising, a rover
al of it. Or, as on some occasion  the
Spatie n opinion first, and thbn. It. emg
, Ind too absurd or too plainly n ba .
Sdieu with deisions of the Federal Courts,
a modification of it. I
So on through the ist, ,Mr. Hayes to
maintainining at ill times the pre*minence ap
over the others which bef bhis high hi
place. Grant, for one reason or another, an
kept rogues in officee. Hayes knowingly
4 put them n as a rewar for partiUsan h
service. Grant was c alfioviding
t places for his reluites. Thlis adminis. do
tration has ard sisters, e6asns and eel
aunts in the public service than Grant ed
e ever drned of. . 4
if Men Who really cite for genuine re
a form will hereaa be slew o put bhelW
Sfaith in any oge simpyi because he pro
e claims hmsealt refbrijis. There Is
Smore real hope for amom ia th little d
Sager of Hendricks, or yard, or Thor- chl
man, than in the whodiexistlg 'dmin- anl
t tration. In fact, eorruption and dicker am
has bepme such eontrollinmg iaeece by
in theradiaeslpr that I doubt it re- ja
s fronr possible while it remains in pow

, The breaking out of yellow fever at
if Memphis is announced, and the Inevita
ble pnaiseaaens. The disease was not,
oteourse imported this year, but it may
yet come from abroad to Gulf or Ada- th
tic ports, to which possibl it would not
t spread from emphis. If the money
Svoted for rigerating or dislanfeetinjg
ships is' to be used it should be used as
onca. There Is no possible eso ase fr
