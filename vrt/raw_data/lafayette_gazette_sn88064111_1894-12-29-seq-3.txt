RSinta Claus at the Methodist
Church.
The Juvenile Missionary Society
of the Methodist church, under the
auspices of Mrs. T. S. Randle, ga-re
a most enjoyable entertainment last
Thursday atternoon at the Method
ist church. "The Missionary
Clock," a recitation by twelve boys
and girls, was a prominent feature
of the affair, and evoked general
commendation. Songs and recita
tions by the little folks completed a
very interesting program. A col
lection was then taken up and a lib
eral amount realized for missionary
work. Santa Claus here-made his
appearance, loaded with the goods
to delight the hearts of the children,
and distributed his wares without
stint. He then bade the young
folks follow him, and conducted
them, amidst the greatest glee, into
the parsonage, and there fairly
bankrupted himself in treating to
cake, can ly, nurs, etc. The older
folks also shared in Santa's gener
osity, and seemed to appreciate the
good things just as thoroughly as
the young folks. During the exer
cises Rev. Mr. Randle, on behalf of
the Sunday School children, pre
sented their superintendent, Mr.
, David Riggs, with a large and com
fortable rocking chair.
Christmas Eve Party.
The party at the Crescent hotel
on Christmas eve was one of the
most brilliant social events that have
taken place in Lafayette during the
year 1894. It was a very tashiona
ble affair, and the costumes were
beautiful. The hospitable host and
hostess, Mr. and Mrs. Hahn, were
untiring in their efforts to make all
the guests enjoy themselves, and
they were eminently successful.
Among those present were:
Mesdames Kelly, Parrot, Hahn, Bonnet,
Serret,l-DeBlanc, J. F. Mouton, M. Mouton,
Iliossat, Cornay, L. F. Salles. Misses Ade
Inaide Lovensjhold, Lettic Collins, Maud

Christmas at Milton.
Orn Christmas night the children
in the neighborhood of Milton had
a very enjo) able time. Prof. Ben
Toler, teacher of the public school
of that place had, with the assis
tance of the patrons, prepared a
christmas tree, which was loaded
with all the good things that money
can buy. After a few explan
atory remarks by Prof. Toler, Mr.
Victor Peodilre made a brief and
approprate speech in French; he
was followed by Mr. Robert Brous
sard who also spoke in French.
Then Santa Claus (Dr M. R. Cush
man) came on the scene and made
the hearts of the little ones beat
with joy. The venerable "old
man" was liberal in his distribution
of fruits, cakes, etc. The children
of the vicinity of Milton will al
ways remember the Christmas of
14Hobinca-Olivier.
Another beautiful wedding at
tracted a large number of people at
the Catholic church Thursday even
ing. Miss Julia Olivier, one of the
handsomest and most charming
young ladies of- Lafayette. was mar
ried to Mr. Fred Hobien, by the
Kev. Father Forge. The bride was
born and reared in this town, and
no one enjoys the esteem of a larger
circle of friends. The groom is an
emplloye of the Southern Pacific Co.,
and is a young man of great worth.
At about 5 o'clock the bridal par
ty entered the church. The bride,
dressed in light gray satin, with
crepon trimming, walked to the altar
by the side of her father, Mr. O.
Olivier. The bridesmaid, Miss Nita
Scranton, was most becomingly at
tired in blue silk. Mir. George
Whiting, a friend of the groom. was
best man. After the ceremony at
the church, a number of friends and
relatives ,epair.d .:o 'h" b.;\i e'
home, where a reception was given
in honor of the young couple, who
left on the westbound train for San
Antonio. They will spend two
weeks in that city, after which they
will go to El Paso, Texas, their fu
ture home.
The Gazette extends its congratu
lations to Mr. and Mrs. Hobieu,
and wishes them a full measure of
happiness.
Christmas Exercises.
Prof. Greig and his iable assist
ants, Miss M. Jamieson and Miss
Lizzie Mudd, may well feel proud
of the success of the Christmas ex
ercises by the pupils of the public
school, at the school house last
Monday evening. It has seldom
been our pleasure to witness a more
interesting school entertainment,
and one gotten up with as much
taste. The recitations were brief
and appropriate, and the little ones
spoke their pieces with honor to
their teachers, and credit to them
selves. The Gazette does not care
to particularize, because they all
did well, but it cannot fail to com
pliment little Tom Tolson, for he
brought down the house and made
a big hit. The following is the pro
gram:
Song, "Hark ! Oh, Hark ! the............
Christmas Bells"................ School.
Prayer ................Rev. T. S. Randle.
Salutatory............... Rufus Mouton.
A Christmas Wish.......... Boys and Girls.

To Pay for the School House.
On January r the last payment on
the public school house is to be
made. We regret to say that the
sum of $ioo is lacking to make up
the amount of $25o. By dint ofl
energy Prof. Greig has raised the
amount now in hand, and he hopes
to be able to raise the balance
needed by the ist of next month,
and his failure to do so will cause
very great embarrassment. There
are a number of patrons of thel
school who have not yet contributed
their share, and it is to be hoped
that they will make their contribu
tions, now that the money is badly
needed. Prof. Greig has already
devoted a great deal of his time to
the collection of sufficient money to
build the school house, and our
people should show their apprecia
tion of his good work and publlc
spirit, by helping to meet the last
payment on the building. Few
communities are blessed with a pub
lic school under better management,
and it would be a lasting disgrace
on the people if they fail or refuse
to raise the small sum of $Ioo. If
everyone who has not already con
tributed his share will give 50 cents
or a dollar, it will be an easy matter
to make the payment. It is useless
for us to dwell longer upon the ur
gent necessity of immediate action
by the people. All will admit that
good schools are absolutely neces
sary in a town, and the only way to
have them is by suplorting them.
Mr. Greig is ready to receive sub
scriptions, and those who have not
already given their share, should
hasten to do so, as the time is short.
A Farmer'; Say.
SCOTT, LA., Dec. 24, 1894.
In nearly all the newspapers that come un
der our eyes we read communications, writ
ten by individuals who have never seen a
cotton stalk, telling us that we plant too
much cotton. "Why don't you do as we
tell you," say these people, "'and plant
more corn, potatoes and peas, and raise
more hogs, and plant less cotton. Well ad
mitting that we plant too much cotton, can
these savantt explain how we find ready
sale for the surplus? And suppose we fol
low their advice and plant less cotton and
raise more corn, potatoes, peas, porke and
other necessaries of life can they tell us
what will become of our brothers of the
WVest with their surplus of corn, meat,
wheat, potatoes and lard, which they sell to
us every year? Now, that can't work. It's
all humbug. The proof that we don't
plant too much cotton is its ready sale if
put on the market. The low price of cot
ton is attributable to the gambling of the
speculators before our seed is stortd for the
next crop. To prove that we are right let
us not submit to this gambling and pledge
ourselves, by written agreement, not to sell
our cotton at 3Si for low ordinary and 7 318
for fair, and bf written agreement establish
the following sices: low ordinary, 63;
ordinary 7; g>od ordinary 73; fair, to;
with the following pledge properly signed.
I, No cotton to be delivered bhfore the
last bale of cotton is ginned in all cotton
states. 2, One farmer to be appominted in
each county to keep a memuorandumn of the
number of bales, their weight and owners'
names. 3, Enach ginner to tnake a weekly
report to county appointee, of number of
bales, etc. 4, County appointee to nmake a
weekly report to State ap;pointee, who, will
report weekly to the head quarters for all
cotton states. 5, Sample of each hale to be
furnished by county appointee to Sample
depository oftice for purpose of fixing prices.
6, No hale to weigh more titan 550 poualds.
7, Each buyer to sign his namc, staling nuom
ber of bales wunted sal, giving .scurity)
binling himself to take quantity contracted
for and to pay on delivery. 8, Money to be
