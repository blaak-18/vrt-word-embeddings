Olass Tombtones.
A glass tombstone stands in but one
place in the United States, and that is I
in the cemetery overlooking the city I
S of Kittanning, Pa. It has but re
cently been set up there over the I
s grave of Mrs. Elizabeth Pepper of I
Ford City, by her son, Matthias Pep- t
per. The Kittanning cemetery po- t
sesses many natural and artificial '
beauties. It has been handsomely I
laid out, with winding walks, stately f
trees and ornamental monuments.
r. Not one of the piles of marble and E
` granite attracts so much attention as b
st the piece of polished glass, with its s
Sdclear inscription, which stands on a s
re gentle slope falling slowly from the I
10 hilltop. Go into any old grave yard, e
In where stones were erected more than '
100 years ago, and it will be found to a
a be the exception where all the letter- l!
, ing on the monuments can be made b
te out. The stone has crumbled and the n
a outline has been obliterated. No c
* effect is produced by weather on glass. ti
The Pepper monument is made of v
a plate glass one inch thick, a foot and F
a half wide and four feet high. It a
I- stands in a mortise cut into a cube of F
Ssandstone. The top of the glass is o
v arched. The lettering on it is made a
by the ,sand blast" process, and is w
s distinct. This does not seem out of fi
place in a Kittanning cemetery. S

Iap A TRAGIC END TO LIPL.
Awful Strlgge ina a Torrent That Swept
a Man to Death.
The most tragic death that has oc
Sth, curred in this country recently was of
Chief Engineer William A. Allen, of
the Maine Central railroad, says the
New York World. Those who witnessed
one it will never recover from the horror
of the scene they looked upon from the
by bridge over Lewiston falls. Mr. Allen
iby. was on his way from Portland to Lewis
)na ton. As the train passed onto the bridge
r, he stepped out upon the rear platform
tiro to glance at some work that was being
of done on the sidewalk of the bridge.
the The train was moving quite rapidly a',
ins Mr. Allen reached the platform. Juet
,uis at that instant one of the uprights at
of the side of the bridge struck him on tho
the head. He fell forward, clear of the
II- bridge. A number of workmen had seen
re, the accident and stood awe-struck,
the peering down into the tossing waters
on beneath them. They seemed to be de
ple prived of motion by the suddenness and
nth horror of the tragedy taking place be
ro- fore their eyes. At the point from
which Mr. Allen was hurled to his
death the railroad bridge is fifty feet
above a dam. Before he struck the
ne water the unfortunate man rebounded
is from the pole of the bridge and then
ity plunged downward into the waters r
re- seething under the goad of a spring t
he freshet. Then the onlookers felt that
of he had lost every chanoe of life, but, to
their amazement, they saw him come
>e- to the surface of the mad torrent and
mal struggle wildly against the flood that
ily sought to overwhelm him. It was the
ly fight of a desperate but brave and pow
ta. erful man against impossible odds.
ad Stunned as he had been by the blows
as he had received in his descent, his
Its strength was marvelous. Time and x
a again he seemed to buffet the waves t
he with the fervor of hope. But those who
d, watched him knew that lie was doomed. I
an To the men upon the bridge it seemed.
toas if Mr. Allen's struggle for existence
ir- lasted a long time, but the truth is that
Ie his contest with the waters was only
he momentary. Almost instantly the mer
io ciless torrent swept him onward
is. through the rapids until he reached the it
of whirlpool that boils above the cataract. li
ad For nearly 500 feet he was hurled Q

of His fate seemed certain, but for an- f
is other moment the spectators hoped ix
le against hope that by some method be A
is would still be able to extricate himrelf 1)4
of from his threatening environment.
Suddenly above the foam of the whirl
pool they saw upstretched a hand and
le arm. Then the dancing waters were
all that their eyes could follow, and a

d so hard for life had been hurled over
the cataract and would be no more seen
alive. gI

Our Forests.
One of, perhaps, many little uncon
sidered ways in which the forests of the
country are being eaten up is in sup
plying timber for railway trestle work.
There are 2000 miles of trestle struct
ure in the United States, according to
the estsmate by the forestry division.
This trestle work has to be replaced
entirely every nine years, on an
average, and every year timber amount
ing to 260,000,000 feet, board measure,
is'used for this purpose. Nearly all
the timber is cut from the largest and
finest trees. The annual expenditure
on this work is estimated at about
$7,000,000.
