In the matter of the public print- I
ing the members of the Policc Jury s
have shown themselves worthy of
the trust they hold. They under- s
stand their duty toward the public l
and that duty they performed faith- c
ful.e
* As in duty bound, they let out c
the contract for the public printing, decided
jthtd decided that bids should be re- v
ceived sealed. C
The wording of the call The t
Gazette did not clearly understand, i
whether bids would be received so
sealed or opened, hence had pre-t
pared none, but stood ready to put a
in on4in any manner that would be Y
determined upon. It being decided e
that sealed bids only would be re- r
ceived The Gazette wrote its offer th
there and then proposing to do the tA
work free of charge. The Adver- a
tiser, had its offer already written S
and sealed and which contained e
the proposition to do the work and R
pay a bonus of zxo for the privilege. p
And the Polic Jury accepted the A
bonus and awarded the contract to A
the Advertiser. F
This action of the Polic Jury is E
commendable, for it goes to show T
that they mean to perform their du- R
ties without fear or/navor. pi
The Gazette is perfectly satisfied gr
worth the outcome. o

artists. Francois Coppee, William set

feature, and among the artists who
contribute to the irg illustrations bel
adorning its pages, are Laurens, see
Reinhart, Fenn, Toussaint, Stevens, litt

intended to set the pace for the
magazine at its new price of X234
cents a copy, or $z.5o a year. The roa
magazine remains unchanged in size
