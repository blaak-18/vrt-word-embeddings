A Good Idea For U.s All
Is to invest from one to five cents per 1
day and secure ourselves against loss by
fiery fiend. This insignificant sum put j
together for sx or twelve months, will
pay for a good round policy on your
gin, cotton, store, stock, dwelling or
furniture. Drop us a line and we will

Miss La Lunt, the charming comedi
enne. will present the laughing esueess
"Is Marriage a Pailure?" at the Comus
Club, Friday night Dec. 7th. Miss La
mont presents a minature of strikiug
tact and versatility. If she sings or if
she dances, she does it with an ease and
Sthat does not offend the in
tdie in the march of the play. When
pathos is needed she is pitifully pathetic a
as the character demands and in her
gayer words is quite eleowic. To her
support Miss Lamont has caled a com
pany of individual merit and psemble
balaee and the performance is without I
the muggestlon of a hith.

An able grand jury has been em
panelled for this term of court,
with Judge G. A. Kilgoreas fore- *
The regular jury term of tih
distriot court is in eion here this
week, and our streets are lively
with witnesses, jurors, litiguant,
Sulmerdbe for tiN Puur. t
In another column appeaºs Ile l1
Svlladictory of our former editor-in- i
aliet; Judge M. F. Machen. We
- regret the ciircunmstanees which he
sietms to believe justifies his
eo41nse. and hope that unless his
health is permanently disabled lihe
Swill not remain long out of 'the ed.
itoliaul tieli, where he is so sadly
needed by the cause of reform. As
: a"ssociate editor, we come next in
the line of succession, an:d upon us
will devolve all the work heretolore i
done by Judge Mlachen and our
self. \Ve do not feel equal to
the task thus inposed upon "us,
ibut all the time, energy and devo
tion that we possess will be given
I this paper, and with the hearty co
- operation of our friends we expect
to lmake¢ it a grand success. t
We had the pleasure an1 the
experience of establishinlg and ed
iting for nearly three( years, the
tisi I'Populist paper ("The Conm
rade") inl this State or in the South,
1;and that experience will be a great
help i lthe work we are now be
ginning.
This work requires of us some
sacritices that many tuen have re- i
fused to make when duty called
thenm. We must leave our home
where we received our first politi- I
ccal impressions and sha1ped our
4t course in life, where we have w-arm
friends who have bestowed upon0
· us many honors, and where M e
Smnnst now sacrifice future ambition, 1
Sbut the cause we have espoused
i demands it and we would not be I
true to those friends mor to our- t
selves, were we to refuse the sacri- -
flee. I
The Lotu':sIANA P'orPUusT will
continue to advocate, with all the
earnestness that is in us, the priin
eiples oft, :111 the success of the
People's party-the (cominig party
of this and thie next generalion. 1
We shall endeavor to make this s
a 1Stat'e paper tfr our party and1111(1
having all the facilities which the s
f grand old city and parish of Natch- I
itocbes can afford, and the will e
power, we believe we shall succeed. '
Wt ith an abiding confidence in 1
r the ultimate triumph of right over a
º wrong, we are. 4d

Above are the official returns of g
the late election in this district. t
There are several curious things "
about these figures which will be 1
made plain during the contest al- v
ready inaugurated. ii
To say nothing about Rapides
t parish casting an even 100o more
votes than Caddo, a larger parish,
nor that 7 hboxes (Boyce, Weil's, v
Alexandria, Lamourie, Lecompte, d
SForest Hill and Cheneyville) out
of the 25 in Rapides, cast 735 mo A
votes than the whole perish of E
SCaddo, nor that there are more than
S1600 Populists in the 3 parishes of F
SDeSoto, Oaddo and Bossier, where
we are returned 304, we will S
compare the above table with the v
Democratic vote in the primary V
election held one month before the
general election.
This primary election was a race
between the two wings of the (
Democratic party, and not only c
succeeded in drawing out the full a
Democratic vote in the district, li
but stufed the boxes in Bienville, a
Bomsier, OCddo, Grant, Rapides c
and Webster, and therefore the
primary vote represents the full a
strength of the Democratic party t
in the district, and more than its I
strength in the "stufed" parishes. tl
The comparison will be made in f
two tables; the first showing the o
7 parihes which held a fair elec- ii
tion both Populiats and Democrats e
