KLANSMAN PARADER MURDERED
KLANSMEN FORBIDDEN TO
SPEAK IN STILLWATER

Mayor Coffeen Dances to Tune of Macaroni.
-k-k
Stillwater, Minn.—Mayor Cof
feen of Stillwater, denies the
right of free speech to the Ku
Klux Klan. Mr. P. J. Orn, editor
of the Call of the North, arrives
at Stillwater to deliver a Klan
lecture, only to learn that a last
minute action had been taken to
stop his lecture. The people here
are not in sympathy with the
Mayor’s belated decision.
K-K-K-
By BANDSAW.
Stillwater, Minn.—When the mayor
of Stillwater, His Honor Mr. Coffeen
was approached in regard to the use
of the bandstand for a Klan lecture
he became obviously uneasy and aft
er some thought “crawfished” and
“side-stepped.” No definite answer
did he give yet his remarks were
such as would make it clear to a “kid”
learning to walk that nothing would
be done to stop the meeting. Mem
bers of the council also evasively met
the request for the use of the band
stand.
Even a dodo would have accepted
the statements made by the mayor
and councilmen approached as indi
rect approval of the Saturday meet
ing. Their statements literally trans
lated would read about as follows:
“Officially we will take no action one
way or the other you understand
clearly the reason, so use your judg
ment. We want you to know we are
not forbidding the meeting, neither
are we going on record in favor of
it. We are on the fence, boys.” A
goose in the egg-stage would have
accepted the statements as a polite
political way of saying, “Go ahead
without official permission so that we
can ‘pull the wool’ stuff and publish
a statement and thus dodge the whole
matter.” (See Exhibit “X.”)
Well, after heralds were circulated
advertising the Klan meeting for Aug.
23, something began to happen. The
age old enemy of Protestantism evi
dently showed its hand. Most likely
some united and determined action
was centered upon the city adminis
tration. We’ll bet the city officials
of Stillwater did some real “squirm
ing” and went into detail on explana
tions.” Promises were made with a
recklessness born of abject fear(?).
It is very possible that considerable
weighing of for ces took place.
Thoughts raced fiercely through the
mayor’s mind. Possibly his thinking
ran something like this: “Protes
tants most likely are not as well
organized as the other side and so it
might be safer to give the organized
minority the best end of the deal.”
We don’t know if that exactly re
ports the line of thought, but we
are mighty good guessers.
“Twilight” Orn, editor of the Call
of the North, went to Stillwater to
deliver a Klan lecture that has been
in practically every city in
Southern Minnesota of 5,000 or more
population. When Mr. Orn and an
official of the Klan appeared for the
meeting a large crowd greeted their
view. The mayor, policemen and
several unidentified officers in civilian
clothes stood ready for some action.
Mr. Orn couldn’t quite understand
what had happen ded when an officer
turned out the lights in the band
stand park and announced that the
concert was over and all should go
home. When the Klan official sought
to learn the whyfore of which, he
was told that a notice had appeared
in a Stillwater newspaper (See Ex
hibit “A” again) informing the Klan
that there would be no meeting that
night or any other night, in the parks
or on the streets while Coffeen was
mayor.
Throughout the crowd came calls
for a square-deal but deaf official ears
heard them not—didn’t daTe to hear
them. Then Mr. Orn made a pro
position (to His Honor the Mayor
that was fair. The editor of the
Call of the North said, “Mr. Coffeen,
if I speak here to these people and
say anything that is contrary to law
arrest me at once and see that I get
the limit.” But the mayor wouldn’t
give the proposition even a passing
consideration. Then Mr. "Orn and
the Sian official pressed the mayer
for a reason- explaining his action.

THE CALL ¥ Ghe NORTH
Mr. Coffeen merely said that he
knew the people of Stillwater and
that it wasn’t advisable to permit the
meeting.
The writer of this report knows
the people of Stillwater better than
the Mayor is fully aware of. The
rank and file of Stillwater people are
good, wholesome, law-abiding men and
women believing absolutely in fair
play. After talking to several hun
dred people here since the mayor
danced to the tune of Macaroni and
jigged keeping time with spaghetti
we find even those biased in their
estimate of the Ku Klux Klan en
tirely out of sympathy with the may-,
action.
A fieldman for the Klan even re
ports an unusual number of applica
tions for membership in the Klan
sent by Stillwater Protestants. Per
secution awakens people and arouses
them to action, so from a growth
standpoint it was fortunate for the
Klan in Stillwater that the mayor
acted as he did.
A man here recognized as one of
the prominent Stillwaterites put the
whole matter well when he said, “It
is rediculous for one or half a dozen
men to assume to be wise enough to
decide for many thousand people what
they shall be permitted or not per
mitted to hear. Surely the mayor
doesn’t want us to think that the
people of our city are easily in
fluenced into mob actions of violence.
I don’t like to think that Mr. Coffeen
was influenced by an organized mi
nority that has come out bitterly
against the Ku Klux Klan. But even
a most careful thinker will draw one
of the conclusion® that I have men
tioned.”
As Mr. Om and the Klan official
went to a waiting automobile several
officers kept at their sides. The Klan
official asked the reason for this and
was told that it is hard to tell what
a crowd might do. The Klan official
politely told the officer that he did
not want any police protection either
for himself or Mr. On> in that over
a hundred Klansmen were standing
around, and that besides these people
did not seek to injure them in any
way.
KLAN PAPERS
WELL RECEIVED
Trosky,* Minn.—An official of the
Ku Klux Klan made a short stop
here last week, stopping long enough
to distribute a goodly number of the
Minnesota Klan weekly—The Call of
the North. There are quite a few
here that were so impressed with
the publication that they would like
to get more copies and incidentally
learn more about the Kluxers.

KLANSMAN SPEAKS IN
GONG. KVALE’S TOWN
Benson, Minn.—A national lecturer
of the Ku Klux Klan spoke in the
city park here the latter part of last
week. This was the first K. K. K.
lecture that has been given in this
city, so naturally the Klansman cre
ated a more than common interest.
APHETONIAN’S SNOW
INTEREST IN (. (. t.
Appleton, Minn.—Main Street of
this town was the center of interest
when a representative of the Ku
Klux Klan spoke there. The people
were orderly and nobody made any
effort to cause a disturbance. The
Mayor of Stillwater must be uneasy
about his people since he thought it
necessary to stop the Klan lecture
advertised there. Surely a lecture on
the principles of the great Protestant
crgaaiutioß should met arena# any
meb action where people arc real
Americana.

Albert Lea, Minn.
All roads lead to Albert Lea today,
Friday. Klansmen will come to this
city from all parts of the state to
take a part in the district Klan meet
ing. More than usual interest in this
meeting has been noticed. Perhaps
that is due to the fact that tonight
the first Klan parade in Minnesota
will be People that have up
to date shown little interest in the
Klan are making arrangements to at
tend the public ceremonial which
will be a part of Klan activities dur
ing the day. A Ku Klux Klan nat
uralization ceremony will be held on
the fair grounds and so located that
outsiders may assemble in the grand
stand and get a full view of a very
beautiful ceremonial.
All Klansmen who take part in the
parade will wear robes. The march
ing men will represent only a small
fraction of the Klansmen who will
participate in the meeting. Many
members of the Ku Klux Klan have
not yet secured their robes and should
by all means ask the field man for an
order blank and buy a robe at the
earlies possible date. Now that the
Klan will manufacture robes in its
own plant we can expect better serv
ice. After September 1 robes can
be had for 5.00 each.

mentioned in his complaint are among
the most prominent business men of
Austin.
Despite threats that violence would
be used against them, 125 robed

KU KLUX KLAN
KLUXING IN KATO
Blue Earth County Klansmen Reyeal
That They Are Around.
—K-K-K
Mankato, Minn. The Mankato
Free Press carried a news item some
days back that reported the burning
of a cross on Pigeon Hill. The Call
of the North reprinted that “story”
and now we will give you one from
the “inside.”
The people here couldn’t quite un
derstand the burning, of the fiery
cross, Friday night, August 17. We
will, therefore, tell them a little
about the matter. A class of can
didates were taken to Pigeon Hill
and there naturalized according to the
ritualism of the Empire.
When the Klansmen who attended the
ceremony were pretty well on their
way home, a large fiery cross was
uplifted. The burning cross was seen
for miles around causing people to
wonder what it was all about.
Tell the world, Murphy, the Klux
ers are in Kato and there to stay.
In the near future it would not be
surprising to see white robed figures
investigating a resort over at Madi
son Lake. The eye of the Klan never
sleeps and sees so much that the law
less are beginning to get very un
easy. There are a number, of young
men of Mankato who are being
watched very closely because it is
known that they have been going too
far, entirely too far, *;n their relation
ship with young girls. Watch your
step, cake-eater, for some day you
will realize that it pays to play the
clean game.
“No, we have kluxers in K-K-
Kato.”
PROTESTANTS "FIRED"
New Orleans Klansmen write to
the Imperial Palace stating that
twenty Protestants have been dis
charged as employes of the Hotel
Grunewald in that city - since the es
tablishment changed hands some
months ago. A new manager, com
ing from New York, took charge of
the jiostelry and it is significant that
where a number of Protestants and
Masons were formerly employed by
the hotel that not a single member
of the Masonic order is now on the
pay roll. All have been “fired.”
The Grunewald is owned by the
Vaccaro brothers, steamship operators
and banana growers. They are
Italians and Roman Catholics.

Mourn Klansmen, a brother lies
dead, and the cross, a symbol of
Christian sacrifice and hope, is
stamped and broken in the mud of a
little Pennsylvania township. The
Stars and Stripes, glorious emblem
of freedom and liberty has been torn
to shreds at the hands of a mob ac
tuated and impelled by influences
which are the antithesis of what Old
Glory stands for. Yes, Klansmen,
mourn, drap your altars in black.
Honor the memory of a simple and
humble American who laid down his
life, unafraid and unshrinking for the
cause which is yours. Salute Klans
man Thomas R. Abbott of Atlasburg,
Pennsylvania, a fellow just like you
or me, who, because he dared to
march with the Cross and the Flag
was martyred at the behest of ene
mies more deadly to American hopes
and ideals than ever was a German
kaiser or a Catholic king on the
throne of Spain. Think it over,
Klansmen, and ask yourselves the
age-old question, “How long, O Lord?
How long ? Then fortified by ex
ample of Tom Abbott of Pennsyl
vania and Roberts of Texas and oth
ers who have died or suffered for out
cause, go forth and work and live
with renewed energy for the right.
Klansman Abbott, who was shot to
death by an anti-Klan fanatic last
week in Carnegie,
was as true a martyr to the cause,
hopes, and beliefs of Protestants
Christianity as ever was a Cramner,
a Ridley, or a Latimer, or any one
of the host of “heretics” who “kept
alive the sullen flames of Smithfield.”
The Widow of Tom Abbott Speaks
“He died in a just and noble cause.
Oh, how sorry I am that it happen
ed. -He died because he was an
American.” Thus Pittsburgh newspa
pers quoted Klansman Abbott’s wid
ow with two tiny babies to care for.
She is still, even in her sorrow, able
to voice the sentiments of American
womanhood. The Carnegie affair,
which added new names to the roll
of Klan martyrdom, was merely a
typical instance of the intolerance of
the malign forces which would grind
Protestantism and Americanism into
the dust, and make mockery of men
who are striving to live, think, and
act clearly. Americans wift answer
the attack on the Klan at Carnegie
by increasing the number of citizens
in the Invisible Empire a half a mil
lion in the Commonwealth of Penn
sylvania alone. Fiery Crosses will
blaze on hilltops from Maine to the
Golden Gate. Men by the thousands
will step forward into the ranks of
the Klan, inspired with the certain
knowledge that they have cast their
lot on the side of righteousness and
turned their careers to bigger things.
The story of the riot at Carnegie,
which has been told at length in the
newspapers all over the country
briefly is this:
20,000 Klansmen Gather at Carnegie
On Saturday night August 25,
some twenty thousand Klansmen
gathered at Carnegie, a suburb of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for a great
naturalization ceremonial. All day
long automobiles arrived with their
hundred per cent American passen
gers. The trolleys, the trains and the
roads were congested. Carnegie was
the Mecca of Pennsylvania Klandom.
The visitors were orderly and quiet,
decent American citizens. Many of
the visiting automobiles were de
corated with American flags. Some
bore crosses. It was a great gather
ing of American citizens purely for
the purpose of paying homage to the
Flag of Freedom and once more
swearing renewed allegiance to the
United States.
Imperial Wizard Evans Speaks at
Meeting
Dr. H. W. Evans, Imperial Wizard
of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
was the principal speaker at the big
meeting which was held by the light
of a gigantic iery cross on a hill
side near Carnegie. He told his au
dience that their loyalty should be
$2.00 A YEAR. 5c A COPY
given to America, that they should
obey all laws of the land in which
they live. He urged his listeners to
live the true life of a real Klans
man, to reverence womanhood, to
stand for the purity of the white
race, to be an American first, last
and all the time. When he concluded
his address heads were bowed in
prayer after which to the tune of
“Onward Christian Soldiers” the
great throng moved forward in par
ade. On a little bridge near the city
limits of Carnegie, the parade of
Klansmen was stopped. An automo
bile was jammed in the narrow path
way and all progress thwarted. The
grouped Klansmen halted. Bricks,
clubs and rocks were hurled upon
them from an alley near a Catholic
church. Then sneaking gunmen be
gan shooting. “Paddy” McDermott,
an Irish undertaker, was one of the
men who turned a revolver on the
white clad Klansmen and did not stop
shooting until the magazine of bis
automatic was empty. With one of
the first shots Klansman Abbott fell,
shot through the head. The mob
closed in on the orderly line of march
beating, stabbing, shooting. Scores
were hurt and manw Pittsburgh gang
sters were revealed as having taken
a part in the attack on the Klans
men when they sought medical at
tention. At the time of the fiercest
fighting the Klansmen received or
ders from their" leader to return to
their meeting place and then in or
derly array turned about and went
back to the place from where the
parade had started. There after a
brief meeting an adjournment was
agreed upon and the gathering broke.
Police Take Charge of Situation
The Police of Carnegie took charge
of the situation. McDermott and
some his friends were arrested when
found armed. A few Klansmen were
also arrested when they busied them
selves in an effort to get the murder
er. This briefly is the story of mob
violence as opposed to the right of
peaceable assemblage.
Here are a few extracts from Pit
tsburgh, Pa., daily newspapers which
give their comments on the Carnegie
rioting. They are reproduced here so
that the merits of the matter may
be judged on the testimony of news
paper writers who, if they are biased,
are certainly not biased in favor of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
The Pittsburgh Post.
Autos had been placed at every
available point in the street to pre
vent the paraders from advancing.
This checked them; some one de
manded that the Klansmen take down
the American flags they were carry
ing. The electric K. K. K. sign (a
cross) was torn from the leading au
tomobile. Two blocks further in town
the Klansmen were halted again and
then rioting broke out. A young man
carrying a flag in the lead of the
parade was grabbed by the mob,
thrown into an automobile and car
ried off.
It is estimated that about 30,000
were in attendance at the meeting
and several thousand were being in
itiated. The Klansmen were without
masks but'each had a narrow white
ribbon tied in the lapel of his coat.
More than 5,000 women were esti
mated to have been in the Klan meet
ing at one time.
The Pittsburgh Gazette-Times.
Singing Onward, Christian Soldiers,
the Klansmen began to move slowly
forward. Their progress was met
with fierce opposition at every point,
fights breaking the ranks, here and
there, occasional shots were fired.
Men hurled lumps of coal at the
marchers—for a short time the fight
ing was furious, then the Klansmen,
apparently on the -.ders of leaders,
retreated to the hill where
the initiation ceremony had been held.
When trouble seemed unavoidable
the King Kleagle of Pennsylvania -
is said to have ordered the marchers
to return to the hill where the cars
were packed, pointing out that an at
tempt to break through would only
mean blood shed.
Considerable excitement at the in
itiation field was caused at a signal
from sentinels at the gates that an
effort was being made by nearly a
score of persons to gain admission.
It was reported several gam shots
were fired. No one was injured at
