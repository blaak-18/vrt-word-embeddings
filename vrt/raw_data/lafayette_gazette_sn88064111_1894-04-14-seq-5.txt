This is the same old story, it is old

with them and it would be Erul of

passes on both sides of the same

of them, and tax !-.td owners who
do not live on public road, thereby
equalizing tie work. Every man

L. LEVY & SON.
EDMOND PELLERIN.
I.ast Friday in the sfternoon
occurred the death of Mr. Eldmond
Pellerin of tits town. As usual
with him, he had gone fishing in
the Vermillion bayou, l.; was
found deAd on its banks. Mr.
Pellerin was a mnar iOf simple tastes
and ws. an ardent worshipper at
nature's shrine. lie loved the
broad, expanding praries, the niur:
mutring streams and gentle woods
of hi: native land, and though sad
it be, he :.';d amidst thibe peace
ful, picturesque and delightful
scenes of the beautiful Vermilion.
Mr. Pellerin was born in the'
parish of St. Martin a little ove"
lift;--one years ago. His father
(lied when he was a mere lad and
he was left to his own resources
for the slt'oort of a widowed mother
who found iri her boy the filial
care and dei'ot.ion of a noble soul.
When he barely reached the age of
17 years the great civil conflict
between the States begai -,nd he
enlisted as a volunteer in (ompany
C.,Attakapas Guards, Sth L.ouidana
Regiment, with the gallant Alcibiac'e
DZBlanc as cap'ain, and marchedr
with his comrades in arms to \'ir
ginia in the defense of his country's
fag. In the greatest battles fought
on the coil of the old Dominion thl_
young Creole bore himself with the
daring and bravery of a Romani
soldier. No one returned from
that war n ith a better record and
though in after years he passed
through the corrupting days which
followed el h tr*.il U'i that memorable
conflict, he never tarnished that
spotless record of perfect honor
and gallantry which had shed such
resplendent lustre on the .arms of
the Southern Confederacy.
After the cessation of hostilities he
caime to this parish poor, as were all
those who had worn the grey. Find
ing employment in this town as
c!etk, he served several years as
such, subsequently moving to (;al
veston where lie married a Ime:
estimable la.dy and finally returned
and settled plermanently anmong us,
for it seemed that his heart was set
on this spot which he loved. so well.
He soon became a successful and
prominent merchant. IIc was not
ambitiots of a:as ;ing wealth, for
such was not his ret.tte, but he was
always considered a reliable and
progressive business man.
In politics Mr. Pellerin was a.
Democrat and though he never
sought political preferment he was
elected a mie:n'er of the city coun
cil in which capacity he served
several years with honor to himself
and credit to the community.
lEdiiontl Pelleriji was a devout
:Catholic, a man of liberal views and
of genuine Cihristiaa: feelings. The
natural kindness of his heart waM
refined by the elevating sentiments
and principles of that faith.
Altlhough not Iril!iant, he w.is .
man of sound sen.e and practical
judgment; he was a pleasant con
versationalist, speaking his mother
tongue with rare purity and correct
ness. An extremist in nothing, hte
seemed to possess that elluipolise of
moral and intellectual qualities so
uncommon in mteen. His heart flowedt
with the milk of human kindness and
the unbanity of his manners and the
gentleness of his n:ituire mallde hlilll a
f:'. orite wherever lie was known.
HIe was born w\ith I noble soul and
he has lI;ved as- honorable and irre
pr'achable life. lie has gone to
jloin the Iiiiiinrtal handI who have
preceded him to the shady silde of
the river wl.ere hc will meet the
soulis of the good, the bras e and th
just, fcr the Iportals of the blessed
nmust have opened with joy to the
one who had lived the life of a tr,:e
son, brave soldier, devoted huslband,
affectionate brother, good citizen,
sincere Christian anld honest man.
