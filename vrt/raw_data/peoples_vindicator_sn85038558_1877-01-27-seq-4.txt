Hogs-Use of Grades.
We find much information in

Monthly fitarm journal. It says on
the subject of Hogs; a sulbject we
think of vital implortance to our
farmers, that a sow of large com
mon stock, which is also a good
milker, if crossed with a male of
any of the improved breeds, es
pecially if he be of medium or
small size, the progeny will almost
surely be tine in quality, of large
size, quick growth and early tiht
teaing properties.
Black or slate-colored pigs are
freest from skin diseases in hot
climates. The choice is practical
ly between the Essex and Berk
shire for males, with which to im
prove the native stock of hardy
grubbers, or root-or-die variety.
The Berkshires are to be pre
ferred of the two, because they
are wide awake and good foragers,
while the Essex are of the eat-and
sleep and the sleep-and-eat va
riety.
Either of these varieties require
about one-half the amount of food
to fatten them that our land pick
es do.
These hogs, half blood, will
weigh 200 to 300 pounds net at
12 months old. In other words, a
hog of this variety alt 12 months
old, presscd for pork, will com
mand $14 to $21 in our market,
and be in brisk demantl through
out the entire winter.
A Cas min Pom~r,
Our last weeks article relating
to the sad picture in Georgia
farming, and how well it was re
flected with our farmers in their
vain attempt to raise hogs and
stock, was scarcely in print before
a case occurred in this parish that
eovers the whole ground.
One Richard Valsin, a notori
ones hog and cattle thief living
near Cloutierville, was caught by
some colored men in the act of
stealing their hogs, anrd was ar
rested by them and brought to
town. Now this was lawful and
right, but mark the following:
Scarcely had they arrived in town
before a letter from a neighboring
planter was produced, stating
that hIe would ge on the bonwlof the
thief, whereupon the sympathetic
Magistrate fixes the bond at $50,
which was given, and Valsin re.
turns to the field of his expl'oit,
ready, and nio doubt anxious and
willing to steal more stock.
It is a question, and a serious
one, who is the criminal in this
ease-the thief or the bondsmen.
We, South, are situated dtifferent
ly from most communities, and
every hog thief in a neighborhood
is generally known from the fact,
tiutm they each have been tried ai
aequitted, at least once; acquitted
because it is a scratch if you con
viet a thief, as the chances are ten
to one that nine-tenths of the jua
rymen are no better than the
criminal. But this planter bond
business must be stopped, and
can be' stopped by mutal under
standings with all honest farmers.
We would adise our farmers to
call meetings. in every neighbor.
hood, and enter into a solemn
agreement to prosecute to the end
all stock thieves, an. to disown
and discountemance any farmer
who will bond out a notorious
thief for the sake of his labor,
Labor is plenty and there is no
excuse for this conduct. We will
take pleasure in publishing such.
agreements in these colnmns, and
we beg of our tarmers that they

Don't Feed Corn to Your Fows 1

1W- Diversified Farming.
oil Every farmer whlo hans praclticed a
of diversitie(d firmting the lresenlit year,
shas rleasonl to conigratalat himiself
upon hla'ving done so. It has con
or triblted not onily to the indepelndence
ost and comfort of his entire llousehold,
but hais enabled him to learn an imll
ge portant lesson in comnparing his conl
lit- dition with that of tliose who have
adhered to the crop system. Profit,
tlhen, farmners, by this lesson, andl
pre plant wheat and oats this tall stuf
1lot ticiently for all farm purposes--not
,al- only enough for immediate family use,
but for all the laborers that may lie
rk- necessary to wol k your farmn. There
im- certainly can be no such thing as ,
fly farming with protit until the farm is
able to feed itself, and from its own r
production. Labor can not anid will
ire- not be regulated and rendered protit ?
able until the laborers are fed from n
ey the sources of the farm they work.
rs, There is something fascinating to the
td- laborer in the alppearanc of a fall
corn crib and hay and fodder stacks,
a and the fragrant odor of a well-tilled
smioke-hoise, as well as the beauty
ire of sleek work-stock. There is also a
peculiar charm in flour bread to the
)od laborer, andi the prospect of full
'ck- stomachs and fat living will secure
help and retain it when notlhing else
will. \Ve therefore urge our readers t
vill to look to these things, and see to it
at thalt they do not fail to provide bouu
