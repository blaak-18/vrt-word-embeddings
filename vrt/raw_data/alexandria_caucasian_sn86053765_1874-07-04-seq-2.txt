Wo lay ourselves liable to the
charge of "boring" upon this
question, lint there is nothing
like "keeping a ^riving" at any
thing to succeed in it aixl «'the
powers that be" shan't forget ns
at any rnte. They may ignore our
claims but Uiey shall not have tho
excuse of overlooking us.
This is just the place to get the
representatives of all the people to
gether- anil to have a harmonious
talk about matters and things pol
itical. 0 We extend a cordial invi
tation to our sister puristic* to meet
here and if they don't and won't
come it shall not be for the want of
amurancee of the welcome they
would have had here.

Our sanctum has this week been
visited by Mr. O. L. Walmesly and
Mr. M. J. Cunningham, of Natchi
toches; the fohner, eno of the
stnuncliest and most reliable Com
mission Merchants in New Orleans
and the latter, a most promising
member of the Natchitoches "bar.
It has not heretotore been ourgood
fortune to meet such agreeable vis
itor« as we have had this week.
Our Natchitoches friends give as
cucouragfDg accounts of the awak-.
citing of the people to the enormity
of the frauds committed upon them
and of their determination to stand
them no longer.
We Need a Telegraph .— Our

A Seiiexadp .—On Monday night
last, just after we had. sought " in
balmy Bleep, tired nature's sweet re
storer,"rest from the labors of the
day, and had laid our weary head
npou our pillow, with the delightful
satisfaction of knowing that the day
had brought the boys, " our boys "
home froBX^jjrison, free, we were
brought back to a consciousness of
earthly things by the Btrains of mu
sic, sweet music? Recognizing the
fact, that as the representative of the
Caucasian , we were being made the
recipient of a Serenade, by the - fine
string band of Alexandria, we
sought our window and enjoyed such
a treat of well executed and most
excellent music, on that bright moon
light night, as it lias been our for
tune to hear but seldom.
Many thanks, gentlemen, the Cau
easiiM wakes her bent bow and signs
itself yours truly. Wo will promise
you something moro substantial an

TBS POLITICAL SITUATOK.
Wo have been for some weeks
attentively scanning the political
horizon and we observe with sin
cere regret tUat the signs indicate
a more "than probable division'of
the white people in the coming
campaign, unless wiser counsels
prevail. The necessity of a fusion
of discordant elements as iu 1872
and the burlesque of numerous con
ventions, with conflicting uomina :
tions, w'ill be repeated
unless some preliminary arrange
ment with all these elements is
made, by which these deplorable
results may be avoided. 5) .
In logical sequence the first ques
tion which presents itself for solu
tion is: Who will be responsible for
these divisions ! Before attempting
to solve the problem it is necessary
to make a cursory review ot the po
litical situation in Louisiana, com
mencing with the campaign*of 186$.
In that year the Democratic par
ty was thoroughly organized, fiad
its Central Committee, its Parish
Committees embraced within the
folds of its party name—the rem :
liants of all pas; party orgahiza
zations, was in strict union with
the Democratic party in the-North
and had it« Democratic candidates
for President and Vice President—
Seymour ami Blair. It invited all
to march under its bauner to victo
ry, and we marched nnder it to de
feat. Grant and a Republican Con
gress assumed the direction of our
of our national affairs, - and War
moth and a negro Legislature as
s*iimed the administration of our
State. affairs. This was owing to
the apathy of the white people and
the inability ot the Democratic pai*
ty to bring them out.
In 187(1 we made another State
<&
campaign • under the'banner Of the
Democracy, and if we- won,' War
-uiotkcounted us out, and we lost
the fruits of our victory. This was
twice that tlio Democratic pftrty
liad invited, us to a banquet ifpou
the good things which were to be
ours when we had marched with
banners flying, tokœrtaiu victory—
and twice we had set down to the
table, and elad in sack cloth and
ashes, diued off the husks that the
swine had left us.
Time passed on and in 1872 ait
attempt was made to repeat tins ex
periences .of 1808 and 1870. Up to
this time the strict organization of
the Democratic -party had been
kept and througlMts regularly con
stitcd authority, it called a con
vention to meeLin April at New
Orleans. When it met it had to
contend with two strong ideas
Which had -been growing in the
minds o f t h e p c o p1 c—an d
which fi u aj 1 y brought
about the organisation of the two
political parties " Füst in order
came the. Reform Party, who want
ed nothing to do with National cam
paigns or Natioual politics;.and fol
lowing that came the Liberal Re
publican, or Liberal Party, who
differed from both the Democratic
and Reform Parties, and who were
going to win by .strategy, who pro
posed to. accept tire overtures of the
Arch-traitor# Warmoth", and to meet
him half way. All these parties
were thoroughly honest Und con
scientious in their conviction», and
all proposed to achieve the redemp
tion ot our State from radical ras
cality and negro impudeuee ami ig
norance. They only differed as to
the means to be employed to effect
that "consummation most devout
edly to bo wished for." Each of
them had its disciples and lay mem .
bers in-all the parislies of the. State
and had its Central Conn nit tee.-r
The Democratic party made its
nominations in June, we think, and
the State Rational Democratic par
ty had its Convention at Baltimore
on the 9th of July, if we remember
rightly, and disbanded its organiza
tion there by nominating Horace
Greeley upon the Liberal Repub
lican 'platform, as enunciated by the
Liberal Republican party at Cin
oinnati, And without asking'of him
»-single concession and without re
ceiving from him a solitary pledge.
This was regarded as the formal,
complete and final diàmein bei ment
of the old Democratic party.
Iu this State tfie Liberal Repub
lik u party* stepped into the fdws
in bold and epen defiance' ot the
Democratic ticket already in the
it had worn so well and for so long
and called a Convention of its own
in New Orleans in August. This
Convention nominated a ticket
headed by D. B. Penn as Governor,
field, headed l>y John McEnery för
Governor. The Reform Party had
no Convention, we think, lint had
kept up its organization through
its Centr.il Committee, if we re
member rightly, and here we were
"in a pretty pickle." A fusion
of all tliese- opposing elements
of the white race was necessary and
a fusion was made which succeed
ed in uniting the white people and
in carrying the election. How we
were cheated out of it, we all know
too well, and kirow at onr cost.
Thtë brings us to the present
campaign and explains why divi
sions in onr ranks arc more than
nrob*able,.and enables us to give a
plain and satisfactory® answer to
the question we have propounded,,
which we do "in the words and fig
ures fallowing;" to -wit : |
That party, whichever one it may.
be, will be responsible for this di
vision^ which refuses to make con
cessions to the honest convictions
of the white people who inay differ
from them in their view»;
which evinces a determination
rule or ruin. These concessions
must- * be made before ami not
qfter, any convention • called by
$ny ono of these patties. We must
have but one convention,, and that
must be • convention of all the peo
ple, called by all the representatives
of the." idea« ot the *people, or by
soiné" authority.tÄit tlie£ all recog"
nize. Any attempt to organize the
Democratic party, by calling a
Democratic Convention and putting
ont a Democratic ticket will fatally
divide -the white people. * The same
tbihg would result from the call
and nominations by any-one -of the
parties jrttich divided us in 1Ä2.
We do not pretend Tusay, that a call
aild nominations by tho White
Mail's Party would not at present
result in ' such division. We must
have a convention of all the people,
aud- all tlie people must say under
what name they itiakç the fight this
Fait ..Any other eoursg, any at
tempt by any party to get the lead
and to whip all others in—.will re
vivo prejudices and foster party
animosities that will ruin us beyond
redemption.

Outrage Upon the Preas.
• We had started to say the Bulle
in—but it was airoiifrago upoii alj
the Press and we so resent it. If
the hired minions of a corrupt gov
ernment can to-day seize its forms
without warrant or authority in
.law, to-morrow, it may be. tho-titfle
of the Caucasian, the ' Shreveport
Times', Vindicator or any other pa
per that may make itself • particu
larly obnokious to radical officials,
to be served the same way. The
seizure of the forms of the Bulletin,
at midnight, and by the New Or
leans Police, undtf the flimsy pre
text ot debt, . ^s an outrage so
fl a g r a n t, SG ty r a uu.ical
and. so subversive ot the
only right left to-us, iliat of freely
expressing our opinion, as to de
inaud at the hands of every mem
ber of the Prèss, the most severe
condemnation, and at the hands of.
an "outraged people quick aud just
ly merited piuiishment.
TheJitst resort of Usurpers, and
Tyrants is outrages such as this, aud
a free people should rise in their
miglit .and crush out'such supple
instrument^ of oppression as the
Metropolitan Police. Where is
your manhood, people of New Oi*
leans ? Where is your liberty, peo
ple of Louisiana, when such bold
robbery ami oppression as this goes
im pun fsb cd ? There is a day of
reckoning coming-, when a long
standing account is-to be settled by
the people, with their oppressors,
and when it comes, it will be a day
of awful import to tyrants and
Police.

Now we wish to compare dates,
.with our able, bold aud fearless,
but somewhat fractious contempo
rary. Our first number was issued
upon fiaturtlny, <he 28t.li day of
March, and. if. our recollections is
correct, M(j saw Volume 1. Num
ber], of the Bulletin on the follow
ing Monday. Looking over our
tiles we find our first notice of the
Bulletin iu our number of April
1 Uli. Ouï opinion isthat tiio .ap
pearance ®£ tire two papers was al
most simultaneous. At any rate, if
we were not "boru" \Vlieii the Bulle
tin first made its appearance, it had
not got off its swaddliug clothes.
We have read its editorials with
attention and have "closely observ
ed the course of the paper'' ever
since its first number, it having
kindly exchanged with us both its
daily arid weekly for onr weekly—
and our error if one'At all, does not
arise from negligence, but from onr
inability to comprehend just
how the BuUetin does stand upon
the question of the "White Man's
Party." T^iat all ft s efforts are de
voted to the good of the white peo
ple, that all its sympathies are with
the white people and that it is a
bold and fearless advocate of the
rightS of the white people, we
i&now, as every -body knows .and
we give it full credit for its manly
and outspoken course generally.
We, however, mildly intimate to
our gallant contemporary that we
are rather inclined.to think that it
Ii ;f H not been altogether consistent
upon this question.
However, we proceed to answer
the question it propounds to ut», to
which the Louisiana Democrat says.
amen. In the first place, wö are the
avowed and sworn champion of the
cause i$i the White Man's Party—
and have been so, long before
either it or the Democrat, were out
in favor of the organization of the
Democratic party4 while we were
at sea, and before any liîie of poli
cy had been ®forsliadowed for this
campaign, and we will not desert
our standard until the people of this
State have spoken their mind. It
they speak in favor of Democracy,
we will fall into ranks chccffully
and work zealously for their sue
£ess uuder that name. If wo were
assured that that party could poll
the full white vote of the State, by
compromise with pa^fc prejudices,
we would be"in favor of making the
fight under the banuer of that par
ty, for we would be only what we
have been all # onr Jives, a Democrat,
consistent and .straight forward—
aye," even a Bonrbon Domocrat—
who refused to swallow- Horace
Greeley. But we.believe that the
attempt to unite all the white peo
pie under the naine ot that party
will be a failure, and we really can
not see for the life of as, what is
the use of havjng two white organ
izations or how it is possible to har
monize the two. If. by "organiza

wants the Democratic party to pre

Our Mails.
There is some hitch or règïi
gence somewhere, jn the bringing
of our mail«, which puts us to con- »
6idcrablo trouble and inconveni
ence, and \vbicb_ ought to bo rem
edied at. once. -AVe don't believe
that it is tho ftjnlt of offl; obliging
and gentlemanly Post Master, for
we aro assured that he is prompt,
and efficient in the dischargo of his
duties. Nor do we think that tho
courteous superintendent here, C'oi.
N. L. McGinnis is to blamo to any
extent. Wp do not complain that,
the Stages fail to come regularly,
but-that they do not bring the mails
« lien they do come. Since the re
opening of tho route to tho mouth of
the river, tho stages have been in
the habit of getting to Ç>own by 7 or
8 o'clock in the morning, without tho
mails they ought to bring, and they
lay the blame on the mail boats and
say that they do not come to time.
Wo are informed that the scedulo
time is eleven o'clock for them to
reach here. These three or tour hours
spent in waiting for tbe mails at tho
jnonth might get them. And it
strikes us that tho stages might af
ford to wait a while for the mail,
even if the boat was behind. Better
do that than to ru h through in tho
terrific hurry they do, and bring no
mail. This week we did not got tho
mail that ought to have been hero on
Monday until Wednesday, and on
Thursday, tho stage was at tho Post
Office at eight o'clock in tho morn
ing, with only tho way mail.
. This is tho mail upon which wo
depend for late news for our paper,
and wo don't think that we have had
a single Thursday's mail since wo
started. Up to the time of the over
flow we were congratulating ourselves
upon the regularity of the mails, and
now all of a sadden, and without any
apparent cause, they have all got
cranky.
Whose fault îb it Col? We are in
clined to think that it is at tbe month
of tho rivor^ either with the mail
Agent or stage driver. The matter
ought to be looked into at once aud
corrected.
