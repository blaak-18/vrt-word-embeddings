'There is a good deal of trill !e over
the asphalt cioncessions a4.d I iatters
are rather comjplicated Tii fait. of
the dispute seem to to a'- et a, fol
lows: Abot 12 years ago a great .\cer
ifan asphalt company, now known as
the New Yori: and lkrfmudez iotipatly
and as tie "':iIS .alt truest.' obtained
from the Vone zuclan govermnaiut the
exclusive right for 25 years of working
the asphalt deplisits. These art situ
ated in tie state of Rerniau''z. in tIh1
nottheastirn part of Vent-ie ula. and
are the largest and nmost valuable de
posits of 0i. pa ving material in the
world. being several times as great as
the famous lake on the island of Trini
dad. For 12 years this company has
taken out thli asphalt. and it recently
erected there the largest asphalt refin
Ing works in the world. This conpany
has had the monopoly of the business
and contends that its title to the as
phalt lakes is perfectly good.
There is in existence. however, an old
concession whose date seems to be un
certain to some native capitalists and
promoters which gives to them the
right to work thw most valuable part of
the asphalt mine of the company. This
would, of course. If enforced, work
great injury to the "trust" and destroy
its mn.nooltsy. The natives sold this
concession to i new American syn
dicate, and the dispute between the two
Yankee companies is the cause of the
trouble. The old company has the ad
vantage of pssession, with about 1.(0)
armed employees to help it stay.' The
new company has the enormous advan
tage of having President Castro. whi-h
means the Venezuelan government, on
its side. The case Is now pending be
fore the Venezuelan supreino a ocrt.
which it is expected will run counter to
the president and confirm the New
York and Bermudez company in its
claim. On the other hand. It is report
4 ed on the best authority that ('astro :s
about to annul its concession. to.
speaking simply, the whole questitn
Is. Which conoessiorr is the valid one
The Venezuelan government has itst
had on its hands another of the rietilod
ic South American "revolition-,"
which has further co(mplicated the
asphalt s:rtuition. The "revolution."
however, has about petered out, as
they generally do, and President Vas
tro Is free to take whatever action by
pleases in the matter. There Is a well
delinnd fear that he contemplates usin
the fories of the republic tj( oust the
New York and Bermudez eoimpttny.
As they are American citizens this
would lie a birea.-h of internaltional
peace and miight leail to the gravest
restults. It Is scarcel3- thought. how
ever, that PresIdent Castro will go to
such extremes. (General Frani-is V.
Greene of New York Is president of
the New York and Jiermiuiez comnpany.
ThIs asphalt that b causing all the
trouble Is the ijueor stuff that has
come Into stuch general use as pav
Ing materIal duz'ng the past few years.
In TrInIdad and Bermiudex It is fottnd
tn great 'lakes" whIch look as though
they were nothIng biut masses of lilack
mud. The surface Is fairly firm, and a
eatrlous tlittg about the lakes Is that
the quantIty always remaIns the same
no matter how many thousands of tons
are taken out. As the stuff Is dug out
more of It oozes up. and In a very short
time the hole fills up and the surface of
the lake becomes level aialn. As It Is
first taken out It looks like coal, and
when It Is refined It becomes like cotul
tar. For use In paving it Is mIxed
wIth sand. carbonate of lime and other
substances. Joseru L. MosrioN.

Ermine Hat and Muff.
This winter there is a new departure
in fur hats. Quite a few are made
with wide brims. This style is par
ticularly becoming to young girls who
as a rule look too matronly in the tur
bans and runail fur hats. The illustra
tion shows 0n11 of the latest th:;:t in
ermine. The hat is very simply trim
med with a standing bow of pale blue
panne ribbon: it is tilted upward II
reetly In front by a band and th's Is
concealed by a puffed arrangement of
the panne. All around the brim there
is a narrow border of sable. Like
many other creations of the season,
1 1
the style of this does not depend upon
elaborate trimmings, but upon the rich
ness of the materials.
The muff is a model of good taste. It
Is soft and pouchy, as fashion dictates,
mnd it Is trimmed with two lapellike
Arrangements of sable. Deep falls of
lace almost cover the openings for the
hands. Of course the muff is lined
with pale blue to match the hat,

The great attraction of Lakewoeod;t
