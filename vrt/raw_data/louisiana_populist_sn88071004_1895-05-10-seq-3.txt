was quite a success, and the thanks
for its success are due largely to

Jermey Cows.
On last Saturday evening a large
crowd assembled on the corner of
Second and St. Denis streets to
witness the contest for superiority
between the registered Jersey cows
of Messrs. 1). C. Scarltorough,
Willie Cunningham, C. E. (re
neaux and Dr. Z. T. Gallien. The
judges agreed upon were Major
Hollingsworth, Mr. G. W. Adams
and Mr. C. V. Porter.
The judges made a thorough ex
amination, and calculated the points
of merit of each cow, and decided
that Mr. Scarborough's cow Bes
sie, was entitled to the blue ribbon;
by a vote of two to one. Mr.
Adams dissenting in favor of Dr.
Gallien's cow.
Mr. Porter, on behalf of the
judges stated that all the cows pre
sented were Jersey, of the highest
grade, and a decision was only
reached after a careful calculation
of the points of each.

On last Sunday an exciting game
of base ball was played in Breda's
Park, between the 13 U. P. B's. and
the Men, the former winning by a
score of 17 to 1. The Men were
badly in need of practice, and
therefore did not play their usual
ine game. The 1 U. P. B'swere
presumed to be composed of boys,
and indeed there is some basis for
their claim. They have only one
member (the catcher) that stands
6 feet S inches in height, and
weighs 168 pounds the balance of
the l e are smailer than the ectch

a nse gIame.

Editor LA. POPU.IST.
Dear Sir:-No matter how much
the people of Sunnyside school may
differ about other things, when
their esteemed teacher, Miss Lena
Payne, says a picnic for the chil
dren, they all vie with each other
and nothing is left undone to make
such occasions a success. Proof
of this is that about two weeks ago
the announcenment was made for the,
crowning of the May Queen and
picnic on 4th inst.., it looked like'
the time never would come, but it
did, and before 9 o'clock the coo I
people and merry children be-ga'i
to assemble, solme on horse back,
some in wagons, some in buggies
and some by the ankle express; by
11 o'clock the assemblage was such
in point of numbers and reslecta
bility as to do credit to any com
munity.
The first on the programme was
the crowning of the new May
Queen, little Lucy Brown, which
was ably done by muiaster Ernest
Jones. The whole school delivered
short and appropriate ceremonial
pieces. The exhibition on the part
of the school was splendid, and re
flects much credit on their able
teacher, whose energy is untiring
and whose devotion to education
is not surpassed.
The voun.g people engaged in
various kinds of amunseiuent, while
the sterner ones talked hard times
and politics.
When the hour for dinner arriv
ed a more sumptuous one I would
not wish to see spread on natures
carpet of grreen, to which we did
full justice. and after lingering a
while longer on this enchanted spot
the crowd dispersed, only to reas
seinlie at the Ibeautiful home of
Mr. S.am Moore, whose doors are
ever open to his friends, of which
he has many. The host and host
ess were not lacking in their atten
tion to their guests. In their spa
cious room we ti pped the heel and
toe to the sound of merry music
until the hands on my Waterbury
indicated that it was almost Sun
day.
As your correspondent is not
proficient in dress cutting and mak
ing, you will excuse me on that
point. I was more interested in
their elegant forms and beautiful
faces. F. B.

Net New.
Sixty-eight governments own
their telegraph lines. Bolivia, Cy
prus, Honduras, Cuba, Hawaii and
the United States do not. Fifty
four governments own their own
railroads in whole or in part, while
only nineteen do not. Yet govern
ment ownership of these utilities
is termed "crankism" and social
ism, and is one of the principal ob
jections urged against the People's
party. And a few persons who
have "rubbed up against the prac
tical side of the issues" in Wash
ington want to "drap" that and
other planks and wage the war ex
clusively on the currency question.
Government ownership of public
utilities is no "new thing under
the sun." It is as old as the rail
road system. So with the tele
graph. They are all in the same
category with the postoffice, the
street, the public highway, and
the common schools.
Every Populist in Louisiana
should take his state organ. You
can get it now, together with the
Commg Nation, for the pittance
of $1 00 per year. Forward the
cartwheel to the LouIsiara Pop
UlSrr at once. tf.
Send in your Job work. We
will do it neat and cheap.
