THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN.
(Continued from Page Two.)
covered only by a shallow depth of water. As
the straits have been fully surveyed and ac
curately charted, it is seen that with a compe
tent pilot there is no danger in navigating
them, except in time of a great storm. In
midsummer, which is the season in that region
now, these are not to be apprehended. The
passage of the straits may be made in one
day by steamers, but probably more time will
be taken by the fleet to avoid all unnecessary
risks.
For sailing vessels the straits are obvious
ly much more dangerous of passage, and these
rarely attempt it, sailing around the Horn in
preference. This is the real southern point
of South America, the furthest of a group of
rocky islands lying south of Terra del Fuega.
Not only does this route add several hundred
miles to the length of the trip, but it increases
the danger, as the Horn is in the region of
perpetual winter, with more or less storm pre
vailing almost constantly.
Magellan’s straits were so named after their
discoverer. In 1520 this daring Portuguese
navigator proposed to Charles V. of Spain to
discover away to reach the Moluccas from the
west. Shirting the continent southward he
came to the straits and safely passed through
them, entering the great ocean beyond, which
he named the Pacific on account of the placid
surface it presented. Continuing his voyage
he discovered the Philippine islands, on one
of which he was killed by the natives, but his
ship was brought safely back to Spain by his
sailors, making it the first vessel to circum
navigate the globe.
The Panama canal, when it shall be com
pleted, will cause Magellan’s straits and the
passage around the Horn to be disused. It
is a very long trip, but for steam vessels
which may pass through the straits it does
not contain extraordinary hazards. —Augusta
