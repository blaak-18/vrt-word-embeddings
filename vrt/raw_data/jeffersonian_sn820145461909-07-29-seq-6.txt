INVESTIGATION OF THE SANI
TARIUM.
The Savannah Press, May 12, 1909,
gives notice that Governor Smith or
dered an investigation of the charges
against the asylum at Milledgeville
made by Mr. R. E. Dunnington in the
Jeffersonian, and afterwards copied
into the Augusta Chronicle.
The accusations are absolutely
true. I have watched home papers
and see nothing of the outcome of
said investigations, which, as I know
from experience, will be a farce. I
went one time before the committee
appointed by the Georgia Legislature
and got no hearing. I had a letter to
give, but knew how useless it was to
try and get for it any attention, and
so destroyed it afterwards.
Judge Thomas G. Lawson can not
truthfully say that he has been ig
norant of abuses existing at the
asylum. I have spoken to him, and
know how little attention he pays to
the inmates’ statements. I have
written out a paper telling of the
workings of the institution in every
detail, but it is too lengthy and will
have to be condensed. It is hard to
whip out a band of organized offi
cials, though they are guilty, but it
is possible. Our new Executive
Chief, Governor Brown, should re
lease Tom Lawson and several more
of the trustees of the Sanitarium for
negligence, inefficiency and cruelty
in allowing conditions to prevail that
cause the unfortunates lodged there
to suffer.
Yours truly,

A CLEGYMAN ENDORSES THE
FOREIGN MISSIONS ARTICLES.
Dear Sir: —Yesterday I came
across the June number of your
Magazine in the periodical room of
the Library of Congress, the first
time I had ever seen your publica
tion. I was very much interested in
your opinions on the subject of For
eign Missions. I had time only for
a hasty reading, and desiring to read
the article more carefully I am send
ing 10 cents for the number above
mentioned.
I judge that other articles have
preceded this one. Please let me
know how many.
I am a clergyman of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church, and while I
am not prepared to agree to all you
say in your article, I nevertheless be
lieve a good part of what you say,
and congratulate you on the courage
displayed in saying it. Whether a
reform is probable, or even possible,
is another question.
Yours truly,

“A SOFT ANSWER” BEST.
Dear Friend: —I have been reading
your editorials on the Foreign Mis
sion question very carefully; also
what your critics, the parsons, have
to say in reply to same. A very no
ticeable fact about these ’(criticisms
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
is the bad temper of the critics. It
would seem to me that it would be
more in accordance with the meek
and lowly spirit of our Savior, and
the relationship that these ministers,
these ambassadors of His, should
sustain toward the humble Naza
rene and toward their brethren, to
offer and extend to and in behalf of
their brother, earnest prayers and
loving, helpful advice to gently lead
‘‘the old man” back into the paths
of rectitude. I would think that a
‘‘soft answer” would be far more po
tent than ‘‘grievous words.”
Your friend,

ABOUT SHIP SUBSIDIES.
Enclosed please find check for two
dollars and ten cents ($2.10) same
being for renewal of my subscription
for both Jeffersonians.
I notice our poor shipping interests
need a subsidy. Why not —the true,
American papers like Watson’s Jef
fersonians, LaFollette’s and the Mis
souri World—a subsidy ? Why not pay
a subsidy to American workmen so
that they can compete with the cheap
foreign labor in our own country?
Why not —dismount the guns in our
battleships and use the ships for haul
ing freight and passengers? Build
additional ships fit for such purposes,
and then when we need them for
auxiliary cruisers, etc., we would
have them, and not be required to
pay $3,000,000 for a $2,000,000
boat to our patriotic merchant ma
rine owners. In other words, we
have to pay the freight (subsidy).
Why not haul the freight? Pay the
subsidy to U. S.
Os course, it is outrageous to think
or intimate for a moment that our
patriotic capitalists would have their
goods hauled by any but American
made ships, even though the rate
was 50 cents a 100 nounds in Ameri
can ships and 30 cents a 100 pounds
in the foreign ships.
Why our patriotic Benevolent
Steal Absorbing Co. would not coun
tenance such traitorous conduct for
a moment.
If we must have subsidies, why not
give a subsidy to the little fellow in
order to enable him to compete with
the big fellows?
Let’s take a lesson from athletic
games. The handicap is given to the
weak, not to the strong. In our
grafting Congress, etc., we reverse
this order and give the powerful and
unjust the advantage over the weak.
Well, here’s for a honorable and
fair opportunity for all, and if there
must be a subsidy, start at the end
of the ladder and give it to the weak.
Yours Fraternally,
WM. GREINER.
MUD-SLINGING.
My Dear Sir: —Have just finished
reading the vicious, venomous, and
wholly unchristian, attack made on
you by another one of those unwise
and narrow-minded zealots, namely,
Rev. Archibald; likewise your reply
to same. I want to say lam a Meth
odist and have always “supported its
3effersontait
institutions,” but in view of recent
developments I must draw the line
at any further Foreign missionary
support and, in common with thou
sands of others, thank you for the
light you have thrown on the subject,
and I most heartily concur in every
thing you have said. It is really
amusing to see the righteous rage
you have stirred up among these mis
sionary zealots, and their very help
lessness in face of the facts as set
forth by you renders them absolute
ly frantic, and they forget their min
isterial dignity and get down to regu
ular old MUD-SLINGING, the only'ar
gument or resource they have. (I
am glad to see you preserve your
own dignity under these conditions.)

FROM AN OLD THOMSON BOY.
As a Georgian, and I am proud to
say from your home town and coun
ty, I well recall hearing in my boy
hood days, when attending your de
bates or lectures, the thrilling shout,
“Give it to them, Tom,” break forth
from the husky farmer as he would
applaud you.
Today I wish it, were it possible,
to put your editorials on Foreign
Missions, together with your reply to
Parsons Scoville and Craighill, before
the eye of every church-goer, with a
loud shout, “Give it to them, Tom.”
Let us hope there is enough
Christianity left among these church
goers to make Foreign Missions a
past issue.
And when the church-goers ascend
to a plain and crush this, one of the
greatest graft scheming curses of the
country, at that moment political
graft and class legislation will
weaken; however, they both have a
strong grasp on us, and true to the
cause I say, “Give it to them, Tom.”
Hoping to see the boys muster
with the same yell and carry it to the
ballot-box, I remain yours to the end,
EUGENE WILSON.

“SICK AND TIRED.”
How easy a matter it is to change,
amend, repeal, or enact certain laws
when it is to the interest of certain
great ones to do so!
Mr. Taft had “slated” Mr. Knox
for a certain cabinet position, which,
it was discovered, would be in viola
tion of a certain constitutional pro
vision; therefore, something must be
done, and done at once!
This for the reason, of course, that
it will not do to violate the Constitu
tion!
That, as you know, would be “un
constitutional!”
So, according to certain newspaper
reports, the Senate “took prompt ac
tion to remove the constitutional ob
jection ! ”
In the meantime, however, this
“removal” of the “constitutional ob
jection” involved a reduction of Mr.
Knox’s salary one-third; or from
$12,000 to $8,000!
A short time before this there was
a “prompt action” looking to a raise
in the President’s salary!
Now, was it in violation of any
■‘constitutional provision” to let his
salary remain at what it was before?
If not, then, on the other hand, was
it in violation of any constitutional
provision for the Senate and House
to take prompt action raising his
salary?
Same, also, as to any other salary
raising.
Was there a single word in either
of the old party platforms of 1908 as
to raising or lowering salaries?
Did either of said platforms con
tain a single word in regard to the
purchase of an automobile for the
President? By the way, is there any
constitutional provision along this
line of congressional action? If so,
what is it? If not, why not?
What is the reason, or, if more
than one, what are the reasons, why
Congress don’t take “prompt action”
looking to “the greatest good to the
greatest number” of the people?
Such, for instance, as the Parcels
Post and Postal Savings Banks?
Are these so unconstitutional as
that Congress can not possibly “whip
round the stump” and establish by
law any how?
The people of the rural districts
want these as much as Taft wanted
Knox for Secretary of State! Or at
least it seems so to me.
Again, the people want the much
needed and long-talked of tariff revis
ion. Why don’t Congress be “prompt”
in their “action” on this score? I for
one am sick and tired of the practice
of making certain platform pledges
and promises and then, after election,
doing just the reverse! Everybody
understood the Republican National
platform of 1908 to mean revision of
the tariff downward. But Senator
Aldrich and his gang of interest-serv
ers are reported as holding that it did
ftot necessarily mean that at all.
All sane minds were clear as to the
meaning of the Democratic party
platform of the same year on the
same subject, but Senator Bacon, es
Georgia, has been reported as saying
that party platforms are made in the
night and do not necessarily mean
what they say. So he and his crowd
of so-called Democrats fell into line
with Aldrich and his gang to serve
the special interests, and thus the
people are fooled and defeated again!
But another thing of which I am
sick and tired is, that the people keep
on voting the old party tickets after
having been fooled and betrayed so
long and so often!
