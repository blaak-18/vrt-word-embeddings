PflP Ci VC PARDON MY SPELLING
rur JfllJ Mr. Sommer I MEANT “U”
KLAN INITIATION
An address delivered by a prominent citizen of Plainview, Texas,
on the night of his Initiation into Plainview Klan No. 260,
Realm of Texas, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Having been duly conducted into
the secret mysteries of your order, I
presume that I have the right to ad
dress you as and fellow
klansmen. Gathered here tonight
under the arched canopy of an open
blue sky which “showeth forth the
handiwork of God;” bound together
as brothers in a common cause by
that sacred, solemn and patriotic ob
ligation to which we have voluntarily
and gladly subscribed; arrayed in
robes of white, like the redeemed host
of heaven, emblematic of a pure life
and a spotless character; in the light
of this fiery cross, the symbol of
heaven’s richest gift and earth’s
greatest tragedy; under the fluttering
folds of the star? and stripes, the
symbol of Free om and Justice sworn
to defend the right, uphold the law
and oppose the wrong; we are a part
of a Great Invisible Empire, like unto
the Church of the Living God, during
the dark ages of Roman rule.
Reminiscences
As I speak to you of these things,
there comes trooping to my memory
a long chain of incidents, conditions
and circumstances that have inspired
me to seek admission into the Invisi
ble Empire “that is everywhere spok
en against.” I was born in the state
of Georgia, not far from the famous
Stone Mountain, that stands like a
lonely sentinel guarding some secret
sacred treasure; lifting its majestic
head heavenward, like the Sphynx and
Pyramids of Egypt, venerable with
age and immovable it gazes out upon
the swiftly passing centuries and
ever changing conditions.
A few years ago I climbed its
steep and rugged side, stood upon its
sublime and lofty heights, and gazed
out over valleys more than a mile
below; while I contemplated its mag
nitude and grandeur. But little did I
dream then, as I stood upon its high
est peak; that a few months later
there would emanate from that very
spot, a mighty movement of native
born, white American citizens, that
would shake the very foundations of
the religious and political world, and
cause the enemies of this flag and its
sword, of this Divine Book and its
cross, to quake and tremble with fear.
Investigated Klan
I have always been of an investi
gating mind and open to conviction. I
have tried to be fair, honest and just
toward my.fellowman. I have ever
sought to accord to others the same
rights and privileges that I claimed
for myself. I have tried to withhold
judgment nor form no conclusions or
opinions until all the evidence on both
sides has bee considered. In this
frame of mind I have not maliciously
condemned the Klan; but have sought
to hear both sides, in the interest of
fair play; believing that every cause
must stand or fall upon its own
merits. Accordingly I went to hear
the address of Dr. Minor at the court
house, recently, because I had heard
the other side, both from the platform
and the press. As every fair-minded
man who heard him knows, his ad
dress was masterly, reasonable and
free from abuse. His manner was
genteel, courteous and fair. The ad
dress was not characterized by that
vindictive sarcasm, wholesale denun
ciation and ridicule that forms a
large part of the anti-Klan prop
aganda. His statement of the prin
ciples of the Klan were the things for
which I have always stood, and to
which no true American citizen can
be opposed; and I am frank to con
fess that I have found them to be
exactly as he represented them.
Had Firm Convictions
I stood firm, as immovable as
Gibralter itself, for the fundamental
principles of American government as
expressed in the Declaration of Inde
pendence and incorporated into the
Constitution and laws of the United
States; that “all men are created free
and equal, and are entitled to the in
alienable right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.” I believe in
the freedom of speech, the freedom of
the press, the liberty of conscience,
separation of church and state, the
right of peaceable public assembly,
and self-defense. I believe that every
man and every cause is entitled to
a fair and impartial hearing, both in
the constituted courts of justice and
before the bar of public opinion. And
in the tenets of this faith I am more
determined and confirmed than ever
before, since taking the solemn obli
gation of the Ku Klux Klan.
Time will not permit me now, to
mention all of the things that have
contributed to bring me to this deci
sion and hour, and into the midst of
this white-robed, native-born, full
blooded, Protestant American assem
bly of Brother Klansmen; but, with
your forbearance, I would like to dis
cuss just a few of them. Permit me
to say, before doing this, that having
assumed your sacred, solemn, binding
and patriotic obligation, I am thor
oughly convinced that the is abso
lutely nothing in its motives of meth
ods, purposes, principles or practices,
aims or ambitions when properly un
derstood, to which any truly loyal
American citizen could possibly ob
ject. I am positively sure that its
opponents either owe allegiance to
some foreign power, religious or polit
ical; else they are grossly ignorant
of the tenets of this truly American
order, or they are lawless men, crim
inally bent, with no regard for Ameri
can law, its authority or its flag.
Back to my reasons for being here
tonight:
Klan Growth Proves Need for It
FIRST—I believe that any cause
that can marshal a force of mil
lions of men, full-blooded, na
tive-born, while Protestnat, Amer
ican citizens uhder its banners within
a few short years against the most
determined opposition and bitterest
fight, since the days of Rome’s perse
cution of the church, is entitled to the
senous and friendly consideration of
all fair-minded, honest men. I do not
believe that' so many men of that
type and character could be induced
to embrace an unjust cause, or to or
ganize with criminal intent. Ido not
believe that millions of such men
would ever endorse or approve, much
less commit and conceal, such crimes
and lawless atrocities as have been
charged to the Ku Klux Klan.
Courts Vindicate Klan
SECOND —After charging the Klan
with ever conceivable crime in the
catalog, and the declaration of law
yers, judges and courts, from New
York to San Francisco and from Gal
veston to Chicago, that the Klan is a
lawless mob, illegal and unconstitu
tional, not a single one of these
sacredly constituted authorities, en
trusted with the enforcement of law
and the suppression of lawlessness,
has ever able to prove their bale
ful charges anywhere, from a justice
court to the congress of the United
States.
Federal Investigation of K. K. K.
THIRD—I have watched with no
small degree of interest, at least three
Federal investigations bf this order,
with a view to stopping its illegal ac
tivities and dispersing its membership.
The Post Office Department, the De
partment of Justice and the Congress
of the U. S. have each looked care
fully into its workings. Three times
the Federal government has said, as
Pilate said of Christ, “We find no
fault in them.” But still the angry,
blood thirsty, lawless un-American
mob cries, outside the Halls of Jus
tice, “Crucify them. Crucify them.
If you turn these white-robed, hood
ed monsters loose, you are no friend
of the Pope.”
Criminals Do Not Ask for Charters
FOURTH—I have noted the further
fact that Georgia, my native state,
had chartered the Ku Klux Klan un
der her state laws. I did not believe
YEA, I KNEW, that she would not
charter a secret order or band of men
to practice lawlessness, override the
courts, and take the reigns of govern
ment from the state and nation. I al
so knew that men engaged in such
business do not seek a charter under
any state law. Criminals and mobs
do not ask for charters to do business.
The very suggestion is absurd.
Klan Against Politically Ambitions
Church
FIFTH—If the order stood for
nothing else on earth but opposition
to the political • encroachments of
Romanism, against our free institu
tions, through the treasonable, un-
American oath of the Knights of
Columbus, I would cast my lot with
it, and be where I am tonight. For
the records of history confirm the
fact that this baneful power that has
ruthlessly destroyed all the nations of
Europe seeks to lay its slimy, blood
stained, murderous hands upon our
free schools, our sacred marriages,
our freedom of speech and thought,
and upon the very government itself.
Invisible Empire Pbrely American
SIXTH—In the next I proudly as
sert the glory of my race, and the
pride of my American manhood. The
Invisible Empire of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan is the pNLY 100 per
cent American organization I know
of in the whole world. All other or
ganizations, political parties, schools
and colleges, churches and lodges,
states and nations, admit in one way
or another, all nationalities, races and
religions. The Jews have their Bnai
Brith which is purely Jewish. The
Germanian Society is purely German.
The negroes have their separate race
societies, in which they teach social
equality. The Catholics have the
Knights of Columbus, the most gigan
tic political machine in the world. In
the face of these well known facts,
who can deny the same rights and
privileges to native bom, white
American Protestants?
Klan Demands Unqualified Allegiance
to U. S. A.
' SEVENTH —Another feature of the
klan obligation that impresses me, is
/its unqualified allegiance to the con
stitutional government of the Union,
to the laws of its several states, and
its repudiation of all foreign poten
tates whatsoever, political, religious
or otherwise. This is really the thing
that excludes Catholics, because they
swear allegiance to the Pope at Rome,
above every government, power and
authority on earth. The symbol of
this undivided and unqualified alleg
iance to our native land, is the Amer
ican flag, painted red with the life’s
blood of American heroes; .made
snowy white by the spotless charac
ter of American womanhood; with a
patch of blue snatched from Ameri
ca’s unclouded skies; and bedecked
with the glittering stars of an un
defeated nation. This emblem we raise
above every ensign of every nation
on earth and eswear to defend it with
our life’s blood.
“Long may she wave, o’er the land
of the free, and the home of the
brave.”
K JK. K. Stands for Public Schools
EIGHTH —Again I learn from this
sacred obligation which I have just
assumed, that this truly American or
der stands unequivocally for the pro
tection and perpetuation of our free
public school system, which Rome
seeks to demolish; for the eternal
separation of Church and State, which
Rome seeks td establish; for the free
dom of thought, speech, the press and
worship, all of which Rome seeks to
utterly destroy; we stand also for the
Protestant religion, bought with the
life blood of million of martyrs,
midst the flames at the stake, fired by
the cohorts of an intolerant, blood
thirsty Roman power. Furthermore,
we stand for the protection of Ameri
can womanhood and the sacredness
of Protestant marriages, which Rome
denounces as adultery. We stand for
the sacred rights of Protestant child
ren, whom Rome anathematizes as
illegitimate offspring. Brethern, who
shall hesitate to choose sides on these
great American moral issues?
Many Reasons for Belief in Klan
NINTH—I do not believe that men
will appear to uphold the Constitution
of the United States; to defend her
unsullied and undefeated flag; to en
force her just and equitable laws
through constituted authorities; to
defend the purity of her womanhood;
ot suppress crime in all of its hideous
ness; to accept the tenets and teach
ings of the Protestant Christian re
ligion, then go out as lawless, crim
inal anarchists and desperadoes, dis
regarding every principle of their
honor-bound and sacred obligation. If
so the whole fabric of civilization is
wrong, and no faith or confidence can
be placed in any man, under any con
dition.
For these reasons, and many more
that I could name, I have pledged my
heart and hand to this cause. In the
fiery language of the immortal
Patrick Henry, a member of the Invis
ible Empire of the Salons of Liberty,
I feel like saying, “Sink or swim, live
or die, survive or perish,” I cast my
lot with Tne Invisible Empire of the
Knights of thfejKu Klux Klan, pledged
to support ana uphold every principle
of right and constitutional law.
How Can Real Americans Oppose '
Klan?
In the face of these indisputable
facts, how can any loyal American
citizen oppose the Klan? Only
through ignorance and prejudice, or
on account of an allegiance to some
foreign power. Only those who are
blinded by prejudice, enslaved by ig
norance, deluded and deceived by
false reports, too narrow-minded to in
vestigate , and 'too intolerant to be
fair can oppose the fundamental prin
ciples of .the Ku Klux Klan. They
are to be pitied, rather than censured.
Like the principles for which we
stand, we are here today, we were
here yesterday, we will be here to
morrow, we are here forever. All the
Satanic power? of hell cannot crush
or stay the progress of an institution
that stands for these principles, of
right and justice. '■
THE CALL OF THE NORTH
DO YOU (NOW won
BOOTLEGGERS SELL?
MR. HAYNES’ REVELATIONS
THROW LIGHT ON SITUATION
(From the Chicago Daily News)
In his series of articles now ap
pearing in The Daily News, Roy A.
Haynes, United States prohibition
commissioner, has disclosed many
amazing facts. The most sensation
al relate to the extreme criminal
lengths to which bootleggers go in
their efforts to get possession of and
distribute illicit liquor. Bribery is
generally employed. “Millions of
dollars piled upon other millions,”
Mr. Haynes asserts, “are strewn
carelessly across the pathway of
those engaged in prohibition enforce
ment.”
Some of the prohibition agents
prove unable to resist the tempta
tions of sudden wealth with which
the bootleggers seek to lure them
from the path of duty, but the rec
ords of the prohibition office show
many cases in which loyal govern
ment employes have rejected the
most alluring financial offers —as
much as $300,000 a week in one in
stance—and have caused the arrest
of the men who sought to debauch
them.
The “Real Old Stuff” Claims a
Tragic Joke.
Of vital importance to buyers of
bootleg liquor are Mr. Haynes’ reve
lations concerning the quality of the
mixtures sold throughout the United
States as “the real old stuff.” It is
his assertion that not more than one
per cent of all the liquor now in the
hands of the bootleggers is genuine.
Very much of the mysterious fluids
represented by bootleggers as having
been smuggled into the country was
produced in the United States and
bottled under counterfeit labels print
ed resemble those of well-known for
eign brands. »
Basing his assertion on the results
of scientific analyses by government
chemists, Mr. Haynes divides all the
.illicit liquor sold in the United States
into six classes, the first class rep
resenting all the genuine liquor, be
ing less than 1 per cent of the total.
The other five classes, representing
99 per cent, include the newljL.distill
ed moonshine, most of it made in
filthy containers, the synthetic liq-,
uors, the various concoctions that
contain a fraction of pure liquor and
a large quantity of harmful dilutants
and the stuff made from denatured
alcohol or wood alcohol. Virtually all
contain impurities and poisons that
threaten not only the health, but the
lives of those who drink it.
The disclosures are at once de
pressing and alarming. It is easy
to say that people should cease to
drink the hideous concoctions. But
they do consume the stuff. Even
that, however, is no valid argument
for the repeal of the eighteenth
amendment, which prohibits - the
manufacture and sale of intoxicating
iquor. Statistics of deaths from the
use of intoxicants in pre-Volsteadian
days speak for themselves.
BY YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you know that your thoughts rule
your life,
Be they pure or impure in the
strife?
As you think, so you are:,
And you make, or you mar
Your success in the world
By your thoughts.
Are your thoughts just and true eve
ry hour?
Then your life will attest with great
power.
If it’s love fills your heart,
Then all hate must depart,
You will find all success ,
In good thoughts.
Are you kind in your thoughts to
ward ajl?
Then but kindness to you must befall.
As you sow so you reap,
In a measure so deep,
Either pleasure or pain,
By your thoughts.

HOLLYWOOD OUT
BABYLONS BABYLON
PEOPLE MUST CLEAN MOVIE IN
DUSTRY OF VICIOUS STU
DIO LIFE
The decent people of the nation
have been shocked again by movie
lewdness, although the indecent be
havior of the heroes and heroines of
the celluloid world is now so com
mon and so much a thing expected
of them as that the shock is not so
pronounced as it used to be. This
time, a jury of twelve men and wom
en sat and listened to the most re
volting evidence that the human
mind could conceive of the beastli
ness and brutish lewdness of movie
celebrities, so vile in its nature as
to cause the jurors themselves to
turn their faces, crimson with
blushes, from the morbid throng that
crowded the court-room, and even too
vile to be printed in the newspa
pers.
Gaston Glass Case
Gaston Glass, a nationally known
star, whose pictures are minting mil
lions for the big movie barons, was
the star of this performance. Ac
cording to three policemen, who
watched him and a movie producer
through a window, as in company
with two women, one of them being
also a movie actress, they engaged
in the excesses of the famous “wild
party” of Moviedom, there was not
much in the way of vileness that
the human mind could picture that
was not indulged in on that occasion.
However, the jury disagreed, eight
standing for conviction and four for
acquittal. It is always possible to
hang a jury in Los Angeles where as
much money is jeopardized as in the
case of the movie producers, with
the possibility of the Gaston Glass
productions following in the wake of
the Fatty Arbuckle pictures.
However, the jury did not disagree
on the guilt of the famous star, since
he himself confessed to much that
was charged against him and the
only plea that his lawyers made was
that such conduct in a private home,
with only the four participants pre
sent, did not constitute a public out
rage. They also claimed that the
“sacred privileges of the private
home” had been invaded by the
three policemen who got their evi
dence first hand by watching the
parties in question through a, win
dow, over which the shades were not
perfectly, drawn. And these were
the points* upon which four jurors
stood for acquittal and hung the
jury. ✓
Few Horrified Any More
But so far as shamelessness is
concerned, the vileness of unthink
able lewdness, the beastliness of de
generate conduct, the evidence
brought out in this case has forever
put the Arbuckle party in second
place. And yet, the pity is that so
common have these parties become
and so usual this conduct among
the movie people, as that no one is
especially horrified by it. We have
come to expect this kind of living
from them. That they should con
duct themselves as lustful animals
when together has come to be the
natural thing and the public would
be surprised at any other kind of
deportment. So a court-room, pack
ed to suoffcation, heard the revolting
evidence of the degenerate practices
of these movie artists upon the oc
casion in question, and only giggled
and twittered at the embarrassment
of the lady jurors as they were forc
ed to listen to- such vileness. All
seemed to accept the facts brought
out as the every day happenings that
transpire among the movie people.
And yet, these are not only the
entertainers of the nation, hut they
are the teachers of the childhood of
America and the youth of the Repub
lic in ideals and character. No in
stitution within the borders of this
land ocupies a place of approaching
advantage in the matter of moulding
and making the text generation.
The effects of such teachers are al
ready apparent upon every street of
every city in America. Just wh*at
the terrible consequences will be to
our civilization is a matter of con
jecture, but that our morality is be
ing shot absolutely to pieces by
such so-called artists, no informed
man can doubt.
Hollywood Forgets Publicity
Gaston Glass will continue io “pull
down” hundreds of thousands in
salary and his pictures will be even
more popular than usual, since the
people have gotten a glimpse of the
kind of man he is. Hollywood will
soon forget the publicity given the
Glass party while she is thrilled with
some new and more vile sensation,
if such a thing is possible. The na
tion will continue to feed its mind
and soul from such a source, putrid
THE VISION OF OUR
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM DE
MANDS FAITHFUL ATTEN
TION.
The American school must draw
its inspiration from something high
er than material well being. Welf
equipped schools and competent
teachers are not enough. We must
have moral integrity of purpose as
well as material development. The
potential citizen must have instilled
into him the great necessity of see
ing his brother’s need and meeting
it. The world is beginning to see
that might is not essentially right.
A disturbing element of the times
which would cast its cloak of mate
rialism about the youth of the com
ing generation, is the theory of evolu
tion. Some of the pulpits have given
voice to this theory of the origin of
men, and some professors in univer
sities have joined the ranks of those
who try to teach that man sprang
from a jelly-fish and not from the
Infiinite Creative Mind—Our Heaven
ly Father—God.
Our civilization rests upon the
origin of man as defined and set forth
in the first chapter of Genesis, that
man was created in the image and
likeness of God. The men who
founded our great institutions, wrote
the Declaration of Independence, and
firmly set this continent upon the
solid rock of political government of
the people and by the people, believed
that man is the product of Infinite
Mind rather than the outcome of an
inanimate fish. No country has yet
survived which controverted the Bible
of our fathers, and placed brutal
force above spiritual power. Men or
nations who forget God and set up
for themselves false theories of the
survival of the fittest, generally pay
tribute to the god of war, and even
tually sleep in the ashes of their own
folly. The greater cannot spring
from the lesser; man was never a fish
nor an ape. Man is the product of
the Infinitely Great, the child of the
living, moving, active Principle, or
God. All true knowledge or con
sciousness, the gaining of which is
the correct evolution, is the enlight
enment of the mind by the applica
tion of Truth as taught by the Bible,
and not by Darwin. When educa
tion has lost its element of spiritual
truth it is not worth having.
Sow Seeds* of Human Liberty
The seeds of human liberty which
were so liberally planted by our fa
thers and enriched by their blood,
have brought forth after their kind.
The American ideal shines with such
glow and luster that it lightens the
dark corners of earth, as a ray of
hope, like the “star in the East”
which appeared to the wise men of
old. And as Moses sentifcis advance
guard to spy out the land of promise,
so twenty-seven nations of earth have
sent a total of 1,500 students to be
enrolled in American colleges. These
students will return td their native
lands, and their influence in lands
king crowned and priest-ridden for
centuries, will be as a voice in a vast
wilderness.
enlightenment must come
through the English tongue, which
was first to break the shackles of
political and religious tyranny. The
world is calling America to “umpire”
a game which is being played on an
European field, in which she can take
no part since she is not versed in
intrigue and national selfishness.
Our part in this great drama is to
keep burning the fires of human li
berty as beacon lights, so that a tired
and foot-sore world may find its way
out of the morass of human bond
age and slavish selfishness.
The vision of our educational sys
tems have progressed beyond the nar
row limits of our first institutional
training, and this is but the purpose
intended by those who carved the way
and planted our course and distance
in the establishment of institutional
learning, which now far exceeds the
most roseate dream of the pioneer.
But with unselfish hands we must
guard well the portals of knowledge.
We must purify every avenue with
the philosophy of the Man of Naz
areth. For in such philosophy rests
all human hope, all the elements
which go to make a great people,
who can stand the storm of assault,
of envy and religious intolerance in
its organized effort to enslave. —Se-

BOOTLEGGING CHINKS
AND MULE-KICK
FRENCH MORALS AND NATION
AL WELFARE.
Chinks are being smuggled into
the United States at a rate that de
fies the rapid action of a double
gaied adding machine. Every time
the clock strikes more Chinese jump
across the border than can be fed in
a hundred American soup houses.
These ignorant and vicious aliens be
come a drain and a drag upon the
cities that are forced to harbor them
They will work for ten cents a day
and a dish of “rat-stew.” Eventually
the furnishing of “rodents” for the
“stew” will get to be a tax on Amer-
cans. The American laborer can
not work for ten cents a day, and he
doesn’t, as a rule, care much for
rat-stew. Sometimes he pays more
than ten cents a day for his chew
ing tobacco alone. If forced into
competition with the rat-eater,
American labor must sign its own
death warrant and sing its own dirge.
Every moment that passes in lax
nesg as regards the correction of il
legal immigration means added in
fection to the health of the American
commonwealth. It also means that
the American will not be able to buy
quite so much tobacco each day—
tobacco, in this particular figure of
speech, symbolizing relaxation and
pleasure. Bootlegging Chinamen at
the southern line and bootlegging
mule-kick at the northern border is
SOME problem to solve to the satis
faction of those who love good gov
ernment.
France and Her Morals
France thinks that she will have
to fight again in fifteen or twenty
years—and she is concerned about
her present birth rate. France’s
birth rate is steadily declining; Ger
many's is holding its own. France
plans a reduction in taxes as a bait
to coax the French bourgeoisie to do
what she knows her upper class
parents will never consent to do. But
France’s anviety and her offers of
reward to those who are righteously
fecund will be of little avail. She is
not looking in the right direction for
cure. Until France changes her
moral code she will remain low in
man-power even as she is now low in
virtue. Clean, ethical thought and a
fundamental change in everyday
morals will help France’s birth rate
far more than loud and piercing
screeches about that birth rate. The
basic strength of any nation depends
upon clean education—public school
education such as we have here in
America—and high purpose in life.
The French fundamental idea is sen
suousness when it is not plain sen
suality. Everything in France is
based upon that phase of character.
And let it be stated with frankness,
you can not build a strong nation
upon the creative reaction of roues
and courtesans, or those who look
favorably upon life where there is a
too general freedom in respect to the
moral code. The late war brought
home to us many unpleasant facts
about France. Is it not joyous to
live in a land where every mother is
an expression of wholesome mother
hood? It is something to the world
and to the birth rate in America that
the strain of Puritanism still works
in our nation as a strong leaven of
grace. *'< "biSOI
