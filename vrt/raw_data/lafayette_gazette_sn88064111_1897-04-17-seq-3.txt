PUBLIC OPINION
Reflected In the Papers of this
Great State.
:'1iat is the sort of a fighter Don
Caffery is. He does not belong to
that':feeble breed of fighters who
are ready to whip the enemy by lay
ing down their arms) who, on the
eve of a pitched battle with the
enemy, exclaim, "They are going
to takke our position any way and
we mnght as well let them have it."
Senator Caffery is no political her
maphrodite. He does not believe in
whipping the enemy by laying down
4s'" ahms and letting the foe fall
into the trap he has set for himself.
-Daily States.
On Wednesday last President
McKitiley sent a special message to
Congress calling attention to the
suffering and destitution -resulting
tiom the overflows in Mississippi,
Arkansas and other States, and
recommending a liberal alppropria
tion for the relief of the victims. A
billrproviding $200oo,ooo for this pur
pose was at once submitted, passed
by both the Senate and the House
of. representatives and signed by
the president, all before the setting
of Wednesday's sun. Such prompt
ness -and zeal in the cause of hu
manity is beyond all praise.-Don
aldsonville Chief.
There has grown up in this coun
try a classy.of corporation lawyers
who make:a specialty of the busi
ness of reorganizing] bankrupt rail
road corporations, and they are re
ported to have paid enormous
profits out of the misfortunes of in
vestors. The fact is, the legal fra
ternity, who of old time were pre
eminent for their public spirit and
high sense of honor, seem to be de
generating, with the rest of the
-wolld, .into shysters and unscrupu
lous tricksters. Time was when
even an implied pledge of a gentle
man of the bar was as binding upon
him as his bond,; but,1;as a rule,
that condition has:.passed',into the
limbo of forgotten things.-Daily
States.
The-action of the Board of Par
dons.. in this matter demonstrates
the fact that a man possessing pol:t
ical influence can commit almost
any crime, no matter how vile or
infamous, and go unwipped of jus
tice. Under our miserable system
of criminal laws, it is exceedingly
difficult, particularly in New Or
leans, to convict evil-doers. Why,
then, should the tax-payers and the
State's prosecuting officers be put
to the expense and trouble of at
tempting to punish criminals and
protect society if, immediately af
ter convictioti, a pardon is to fol
lowP Why not, indeed, wipe out
our criminal code and let crime run
riot? There is altogether too much
of this infernal pardoning business,
anyway, and it is high time the
press of Louisiana should protest
in thunder tones against it. As a
matter of fact, the laws seem to be
framed for the poor and friendless
to observe- the rich and influen
tial can defy them with impunity.
-West Baton Rouge Sugar Planter.
We are quite prepared to con
cede that several of the schedules
of the Dingley bill--the woolen
schedule particularly -are bad
nay, infamous. But it must be re
membered that that bill is immeas
ably superior to the Wilson measure
so far as sugar, rice and lumber are
concerned. Moreover, despite all
assertions to the contrary, the tariff
is a local question, some
sectlons requiring free trade, while
other communities are dependent
for their prosperity upon protection.
Take the planters, for instance.
Total or partial free trade, as re
presented by an advalorem duty of
40 per cent, means ruination for
them. In the-very nature of things,
they cannot compete with the
coolie-grown sugar of the islands or
the pauper-paid, bounty-fed product
of ental Europe. It makes
no di- ance whether a reasonably
bhigh'hduty is levied on sugar as a
distinctly revenue measure or is es
tablished as a purely protective
duty for protection's sake, the
planter Is benefited to that ex
tent and the maintenance of
the. industry is based upon the
continuation of such a duty.
In voting, therefore, for a meas
-rs which'is highly beneficial to
the chief industries of their several
districts, Messrs. M'eyet, Davey
and Broussard slmply obeyed th
wishes of their constituents and
peformed a plan duty. For this,
they should be praised, not con
sured.--West Baton Rouge Planter.
The genial idiots who have been
busily engaged for some time past
in writing the obituaries of the
Democratic party and the free sit
ver advocates, must feel badly after
reading the news of the municipal
elections this week.-Abbeville
