A PRAYER.
I look with clearer, sadder eyes,
Today, upon the years,
Which cold and dead behind me lie,
Each filled with hopes and fears.
I see the meaning of each pain,
The wisdom of each blow,
And why the answer'never came
I prayed for, long ago.
The years have passed me many times
Since last I prayed that prayer—
Have seen me drain the bitter cup,
And drop it in despair.
Yet now I never ask to die,
For I have learned to live
For something better than the joy
Which human love can give.
And though these years have nothing
brought
So beautiful to me
As that bright dream of love and
youth,
Across the grave I see
That God knew best, and so, today,
I bless his tender care—
I thanked him for my life’s one
dream,
And that unanswered prayer.

leans Times-Democrat.
THE UNSULLIED FAME OF LEE.
On the one hundred and second an
niversary of his birth the fame of Lee
is secure. The world’s military au
thorities rank him among the greatest
commanders of all time-; even those
who fought against him yield him re
gard and admiration, and his own peo
ple hold him in their hqart of hearts.
As early as the Mexican War Gen.
Winfield Scott pronounced Lee “the
greatest living soldier in America,”
and Lord Wolsey has placed him with
Wellington and Marlborough, among
the greatest captains of the English
speaking race. That his ability was
generally recognized even before his
career in the Civil War is shown by
the fact that President Lincoln offered
Lee the command of the Union armies
in the field when the conflict was im
minent. In a letter to Senator Re
verdy Johnson February 25, 1868,
General Lee states that Francis P.
Blair made him the offer of command
on behalf of Presid mt Lincoln, and
Blair confirmed the statement. Simon
Cameron, the first Secretary of War
in President Lincoln’s Cabinet, ad
mitted that the offer was made, and it
is well known that Gen. Winfield Scott
considered Lee the one man for com
mander. He is probably the only
man in history who had his choice
of command of the armies of either
side in a civil war; and, inspired by
principle alone, deliberately cast
his fortunes with the side he knew
was the weaker in population, re
sources, equipment and most of the
things that turn the fortunes of war.
He was opposed to secession; he was
not an upholder of slavery ; he earn
estly desired to avoid war; but noth
ing could tempt him from what he
considered his duty, and he firmly de
clared that he “could take no part
in an invasion of the Southern
States.”
Another paradox of that remarka
ble civil conflict is the statement that
General Lee, who was denounced as
the defender of slavery, manumitted
the Lee slaves in the latter part of
1862 and in January, 1863, freeing
them before the Emancipation Procla
mation, while Thomas Nelson Page, in
his latest work on Lee, and other’s as
sert that General Grant’s family held
slaves until they were freed by Mr.
Lincoln’s proclamation.
The spirit of devotion to principle
which moved General Lee was the
spirit of the South in maintaining its
principles and resisting hostile inva
sion.
Col. G. F. R. Henderson, the noted
English military authority and the
biographer of Stonewall Jackson,
says:
“This spirit of self-sacrifice which
animated the Confedrate South has
been characteristic of every revolu
tion which has been the expression of
a nation’s wrongs, but it has never
yet accompanied mere factious insur
rection. When in the process of time
the history of secession comes to be
viewed with the same freedom from
prejudice as the history of the seven
teenth and eighteenth centuries, it
will be clear that the fourth great
revolution of the English-speaking
race differs in no essential character
istic from those that preceded it. In
each a great principle was at stake;
in 1642 the liberty of the subject; in
1688 the integrity of the Protestant
faith; in 1775 taxation only with the
consent of the taxed; in 1861 the
sovereignty of the individual States.”
Lee was a fit leader for such a peo
ple. He was the incarnation of the
South, not only a great military ge
nius, but one of the sublimest char
acters in our history. Senator Benja
min H. Hill declared that he was
“Caesar without his ambition, Fred
erick without his tyranny, Napoleon
without his selfishness and Washing
ton without his reward.”
They were all great in victory, but
the greatness of Lee’s character was
manifested even more strongly in de
feat. When he rode back down the
lines after the surrender at Appomat
tox his men by the hundreds crowded
around him, the tears streaming down
their cheeks, seeking to kiss his hand,
to touch his coat, his saddle, even to
catch a glimpse of the commander
they loved even more passionately
in defeat than in the most glorious
hour of victory. He bore all the at
tacks, the misrepresentations, the re
vilement of his enemies without a
murmur. ’He gladly bore the burdens
of his people, shared their sorrows
and looked forward hopefully to a
reunited country.
An old Confederate said not long
ago: ‘ ‘ The moment you saw General
Lee you knew that you were in the
presence of greatness. He was th3
kingliest man I ever saw.”
In person, in character, in public
and private life, in the field, in the
college, he was always Lee. He him
self gave the keynote to his character
when he said: “Duty is the sublimest
word in the language.” He is one
of the few eminent commanders in
the world’s history who were not
moved by ambition and the rage for
conquest;' and in the loftiness of his
ideals and his devotion to principle
he shares the unsullied fame of Wash
ington.
Lee belongs not only to his people,
Oljft Jeffersonian
but to his country and to the world,
which will rank him among its im
mortals. —Baltimore Sun.~
ANOTHER DEBT TO JEFFERSON.
The other day Collier’s Magazine
printed an article crediting President
Eliot of Harvard with being the
founder of what is -called the elective
system of courses in education. In
the old days the student was sup
posed to take what was set before
him, asking no questions, but only
answering them. The new idea in
education is that a student old
enough to enter college is old enough
to know what he wants to learn, and
should be given the right to choose.
The Collier’s article credited Presi
dent Eliot with this revolutionary
departure, and here is the correction
sent in by a reader:
That this is not correct can be seen
from an address by Prof. Francis
Greenwood Peabody of Harvard, de
livered at the University of Vir
ginia a few years ago. Professor Pea
body says:
“The expansion of the elective
system at Harvard is the secret of
its growth. Liberty to teach and’ lib
erty to learn have brought devoted
students. And the last thirty years
of life at Harvard have testified to
the American faith in liberty as the
basis of education. But when we come
to ask ourselves where this system
w r as first devised, we come back to
you. Fifty years before the adminis
tration of Harvard offered even a
modest recognition to the principle of
election it was absolutely accepted
here by the genius, foresight, and
philosophic grasp of Mr. Jefferson.
Harvard claims to be one with the
University of Virginia in a common
devotion to the principle of liberty in
educational life.”
Thus it is seen that not to Harvard
and President Eliot, but to the Uni
versity of Virginia and Thomas Jef
ferson, belongs the credit for intro
ducing the elective system into
American university life.

So it seems that we owe liberty in
education to Thomas Jefferson, just
as we owe so many other good things.
Jefferson had faults, judged by some
modern standards. He never shrieked
for a navy bigger than the merchant
marine it was designed to protect. He
never rode 400 miles in a day, nor em
ployed a secret spy system to jam his
bills through the Senate, nor sent in
twenty-seven special messages to de
nounce opposing editors in short and
ugly terms. But as a far-seeing
statesman he was quite a fellow,
after all. We are glad to see the
new feather in his cap—and to doff
our own in recognition.—Rocky
Mountain News (Denver).
