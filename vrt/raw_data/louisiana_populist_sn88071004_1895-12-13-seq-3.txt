This piee of "conclusive" non
Shas been going the entire
rounds of the Democratio press inl
the vain hope of discouraging Pop
ulists in other pmrishaes who do not

Now would it not have.been
mucehasier to hve given the g
ares showing the actual number of
votes polled in ski Demooratic
priwmryl
"Ileked but about 800 votes."
Well, "about 800" mesas ay
where uoder 400, which shows per- a
e hnap nearly all the Populist vote
e in that parish, but as the tota
a- Democratic vote in that parish at
n the last election was but 356, the

d WASmrsNTON, Dec. 1, 1895.
Editor Louisiana Populist:
In your issue of Nov. 29, you
ask: 'How much would Adam
have been worth had he workedl
one day for one dollar, and then
put that dollar at 8 per cent. Cal
culate at 8 per cent compound in
terest, and answer! Could he
have been worth as much working
c daily up to date for one dollar a
day without interest 1"
Last summer I made some cal
culations, much on the line you
suggest, as follows :
ONE CENT loaned when Christ
was born, at 6 per cent interest,
the interest compounded annually,
a would have amounted to 4240018
e 4941626438324250 405169973403198
4355312 dollars by the 31 Dec.,
1896. Can you enumerate it ?
From the birth of Christ to the
- close of 1896, we have 593448 days,
exclusive of Sundays; at a dollar
a day, a man would have made
593448 dollars; at a dollar and a
half a day he would have made
890172 dollars; at two dollars a
day he would have a million, and
could have spared a few days to
. work for and vote the Democratic
ticket, which Democracy legali
zos, 8 per cent interest in Louisi
ana.
Were theo earth solid gold, its
I value in dollars at present number
of grains to the dollar, would
be 11728483813435895527200000000
'dollars. ONE cENT loaned at 6
per cent compound interest at the
birth of Christ, would buy 361500
000000000000 worlds of the size of
this one, solid gold I Three hun
dred and sixty-one quadrillions,
five hundred trillions of solid gold
worlds I Is it comprehensible ?
The distance from the earth to
the sun is 95000000 of miles. A
solid gold ball 95000000 of miles
in diameter-from here to the sun
-would be worth 30.3431532032000
000000000000000000000 dollars.
One cent loaned at 6 per cent
compound interst at the birth of
Christ would buy 13970 solid gold
worlds as large as from the earth
to the sun I
Is it surprising that the first Na
poleon, on being shown an interest
table, exclaimed, "It is wonderful
that this monster has not swallow
ed up the world I"
Should we be surprised that
since Napoleon's day this monster
-Interest-has swallowed us-?
The surprising feature is that we
have permitted it to do so, and that
many are still aidingit by support
ing old party men, tickets and
measures.
When will the people recognize ]
that the only salvation of the peo
ple must come through the People,
not through Usurers I

The Populist Campaign Com
mittee, consisting of A. B. Booth,
J. T. Howell, J. W. McFarland,
E. C. Dillon, J. A. Tetta, H. L.
Brian, A. Benoit, R. D. Wilde, I.
J. Mills, Joe. Kleinpeter, and B.
W. Bailey, met in-alexandria last
Tiesday and held a conference
with both winga of the Republican
parqy in this . tate. The result
was an agreement of co-operation
between the Populists and Repub
licans in the coming State cam
paign. This agreement inds a
precedent in the celebrated Lafay
ette agreement in which the farm
era combined with the Democrats
to down the lottery. The object
of the new agreement is to down
ballot-box-stnufing and to secure (
ballot reform. However, there is a
a great dctfferenee between the Laf
ayette and the Alexandria agree- a
munt. In the former the ofBeces t
were divided between the Demo-I
crats and the Alliance, while in the '
new a~reement, farmers nominate a
the whole ticket and the Republi- a
cans agree to support it. The e
committee called a State conven
tion to meet in Alexandria on Jan
uary 8th, 1896, Jackson's Day.
Each parih will be entitled to one I
delegate and to one additional for
every 20o votes east for Populist
candidates for Congreas in Nov.
1894. An address was issued
strongly endorsing honest elections s
and free silver. From our stand
point, these are fundamental Dem
t.a primlples.-Monroe Bulle
