“Am I My Brother’s Keeper?”
N NEW ATLANTA, working
to make the streets beauti
ful, are seen a number of
human beings in ugly
striped uniform. Over them are men
with a ready shotgun. What a sight
for a so-called civilized Christian
city!
From Ellis to Fifth street, on or
a few feet from Peachtree, —just
a few blocks, —are ten handsome
churches, to say nothing of the hun
dreds scattered over the city and
suburbs.
Do the priests in these fine edi
fices, dedicated to the ‘Hoving Jesus”
who said, “Love thy neighbor as
thyself,” teach nothing of humani
ty? nothing of soul-growth to their
congregations? It seems not from
the stockade disclosures. No Egypt
ian taskmaster —so-called heathen—
dealt more brutally with his captive
slaves than do these sons of Chris
tian mothers and fathers deal with
these poor unfortunates. And the
men of the city and county are re
sponsible.
There is no necessity to recount
here in detail the brutal, cruel flog
ging, the women strung up to iron
rings, the “bucking machines”, the
sick who were beaten, the vermin,
bad ventilation, filthy beds, spoilt
food, no bathing, filthy clothing and
so forth; nor the application to their
own use of the farm products, and
the work of mechanics sent to' re
pair the stockade, by the officials.
All this has been told in the news
papers and sent broadcast over the
State and over the world.
“Greater Atlanta” indeed, in
cruelty and fraud. Could the hea
then for whose Christianizing mil
lions have been raised this year, do
worse? These millions raised in
Georgia for foreign missions should
be applied right here among our
own unregenerates.
The blame can not be placed on
generations gone before. The men
now living are responsible for these
conditions.
The officials and others say that
the prisoners are of the lowest type
and can only be managed by the
means used. There has never been
tried any other way to make them
control themselves. Certainly no
one would treat an animal of value
with such cruelty, and according to
theologians each soul is valuable to
God, its Creator.
“They are there too short a time,”
say the officials, “to train.”
That is no excuse. If the prison
er has a trade, make him work at
it and give the money to his family.
If he has no family use it to help
pay a teacher of some kind to teach
them. Only put those on road duty
who have no trade. Teach them
through their hands if they are not
capable of being taught through the
brain, as is done in some reforma
tories.
They should have some one, not
an official, to talk to them in a prac
tical way, not about dying and go
ing to heaven, but why they should
live good lives, and how to do it.
What a field for mission work!
On the unoccupied land in Georgia
build the colored man a little cabin
like his forefathers lived in a half
century ago, clean and wholesome,
the fat, shiny pickaninnies playing
around the door, never knowing ill
ness, with plenty of corn, meat, po
tatoes and pure water. Have a
school-house and a church with
teachers and ministers who will
give practical lessons in right liv
ing, no politics and special brand of
creeds. Have these farms surround
ed by guards if necessary; but allow
these human beings a chance to de
velop under favorable conditions,
such as made them the docile, trust
ed servants of the best class of white
people forty years ago.
What is needed is a physical ex
amination of the heads of each of
ficial which would plainly reveal
what manner of man he is, and how
he is living. The convict camps
should be treated from a scientific
and business standpoint.
For the white prisoner, the hu
miliation of being sent to prison
should be enough, but if it is not, if
they are beyond ordinary control,
send them to a sanitarium for scien
tific treatment of the mind, or rath
er the base of the mind, the brain.
There may be a depression of the
skull on the brain that causes their
immorality or makes them dull.
Several cases of this kind have been
cured in this way. Or, see by the
shape of the head what their talent
is and teach them that. Tell them
also how to control their habits, that
it is their thought that makes them
act. All this is slow work, but it is
sure, and the next generation would
feel the good effects of it. There is
a still surer way: begin with the edu
cation of the future mothers and
fathers, but that would lead to an
other subject.
And for the woman in the stock
ade! “Ye men who are without sin,

Contemplation
Deep down in Nature’s mine of thought
There dwells a contemplative mood,
Which often in the twilight hours,
Comes calmly forth for human good ;
And gilds with gold of solemn thought,
The common tragedies of life,
And brings to bar the wickedness,
With which each passing day is rife.
It bids the whirlwind passions stay
Their onward rush, to sin and death,
Turns back the steps of frowning Wrong,
And stays her chidings with a breath;
It grasps the hand of smiling Right,
And sees the beauty in her face,
And in the hall of Righteousness,
Sets Reason in her wonted place.

cast the first stone.” Mothers and
fathers, how can you see into the
future that this may not be the fate
of your darling? The women in our
Christian churches are not acting.
They are kept quiet by the mascu
line element in the family (not al
ways either the wage-earner or tax
payer), who tell them that this is
no fit subject for good women to dis
cuss. Who made it an unfit subject?
Do not all reply at once, the din
would be too great.
Why are not the women aroused
as in the raising of the Agnes Scott
fund? Where is the enthusiasm
shown as in the purchase of the
Woman’s Club House? The mis
sions, the automobile show? Is it
not read in the churches that there
is greater rejoicing in heaven over
one repentant soul than over hun
dreds of those already good?
To paraphrase; “Am I my sis
ter’s keeper?” Answer: “In as
much as ye did it not unto the least
of these my sisters, ye did it not
unto me. WILL DENHAM.
Woman’s Right to Suffrage
HILE it may be the policy of
some to receive with de
rision and the desire of
others to damn with dis-
dain the present agitation of wom
an’s suffrage in Virginia, the Journal
declares itself a hearty advocate
of the movement, which it believes
to be founded on bed-rock, primal,
first principles of pure democracy.
If there is anything astounding in
the present declaration of rights
voiced by the more enterprising
daughters of the land, it is that such
an agitation has been delayed until
this hour, when the great twentieth
century has opened upon us with
one-half of the citizenship of the
civilized nations of the world dis
franchised and disbarred from voice
in government. It is not our inten
tion at this writing to notice spu-
rious, captious or puerile objections
preferred by frivolous minds against
the movement under consideration,
but we shall be content to enunciate
certain among the more potent rea
sons actuating us in our attitude on
this question.
We believe in personal, political
and religious freedom. We believe
in “a government of the people, for
the people and by the people.” As
we believe in a just taxation, so do
we believe in an impartial and equit
able representation. Our forefathers
fought for this, and they obtained it;
when our women ask this of us we
will grant this to them. We believe
that an American woman should be
accorded every privilege enjoyed by
her butler, or by the vender of vege
tables who calls at her gate. We
believe that the American woman
should enjoy the Vl ess i n S of every
liberty guaranteed under the flag of
a free republic. And we believe that
what women gain in liberty men
should lose in license, which would
mean a double, substantial and very
salutary reform. We do not believe
that the active exercise of the privi
lege of franchise should be made
compulsory. But we believe that
the right to vote belongs to woman,
•and we believe that the power of the
ballot should not and will not be
permanently denied her. We can
recognize no valid objection against
the enfranchising of our American
womanhood. We can not see that
the parliamentary franchise can be
justly longer withheld from the wo
manhood of England.
If there remains one reason why
women of today should be denied the
full rights and privileges of citizen
ship, it must be alleged on grounds
of temperamental or sentimental dis
qualification. We can not see that
either plea is justified by fact or ca
pable of being sustained.
In our opinion the sex of a citizen
should have no bearing upon the po
litical privileges of that citizen. If a
woman, recognized as a citizen, be re
quired to pay taxes, if she be entitled
to receive a charter and to enter the
world of business, if the practice of
many of the learned professions in
many of the States be open for her,
then we hold that such a citizen is
entitled to a vote. She may not ex
ercise such privilege, but it should be
hers.
In a consideration of the question
of civil government and political
economy of today we take no
thought for the traditions of the
past. We conceive that we have at
tained a new era of light and of
liberty, in each of which America
leads the world. We therefore take
it that the possible opinions of the
wives and mothers of members of
t b e First House of Burgesses for Vir
ginia would avail us little if we were
capable of applying them to a solution
of the problem at point. But the
House of Burgesses is closed and the
dear, sweet daughters of the colonial
old Virginia sleep in many a quiet
graveyard. In those days the ne
groes were slaves. Followed the
troubled dream of blood, over which
