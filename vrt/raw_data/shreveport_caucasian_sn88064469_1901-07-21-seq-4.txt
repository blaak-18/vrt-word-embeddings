EX .USION OF C IV4ESE.
At an early date the act or law )}
which the Chinese are excluded fron
the United States will terminate o,
limitation an.i unless this act or lag
is reinstated and held in lull tore
the Mongolians will swarm into tb
UnCted States by millions.
It is true the demands of commerce
may insist on non action and the
"open.door policy," which is being
advocated and is favored by Minister
Wo, the representative of China at
Washington, on the plea of reciprocal'
spirit in consideration of trade facill
ties and advantages, but should we,
the people, approve this proposed
influx of Chinese, which in time
WOnMI i1U 'O UiUss5L( ou ruIL5.
The ezclusiou of the Chinese is
essential to the protection and the
perpetuity of our civilization ?
It may be said in behalf of the
Chinese, by those who want cheap
labor, that a million or more of t'hi
rnoe .distributed • throughout the
Southeen States, for instance, would
stimulate the negro to greater exe'
tion of activity, but if one or two
millions of Celestials were to come,
to this would oe added many millions
until the whole country would be
swarming with Chinese, as flies.
As we are about settling a race
problem we should not become en
tagl!ed with the Mongolians, nor
should we, the people, in the eager
mess of wealth accumulation; in the
desire to secure the dollar through
commercial enterprise involve our
posterity into contentions with the
Mongolian race in the United States.
We have the experience with the
negro, we should venture no rlsk
with the Celestial, but as to a choice
between the negro and the Chinese
we would favor the negro.
Where the Chinese are known in
the Pacfile State where they are
numbered by the thousands, the ver-,
dies is: 'The Chinamen carries moral
and social degradation with him
wherever he goes."
The exclusion act which is about
to terminate was enacted as a protec
tion to the people and was suggested
after an experience with the bChina
men in th Pacil: Stater.
This exclusion act concerns every
I.boring man, every wage earner in
the United states, and they, with
one acoord, should unite with other
clesses of the people in urging the re
ematl.st of the exclusion of the
Chinese.
GIN. ADOLPH fiYBB'S JOKE.
It bu been developed under the -n.
luesce of the Summer So:tice that
General Adolph Meyer is a joker. It
may be recalled that General Meyer
attempted "a joke" by suggesting
not long since Murphy J Foster as a
ceadidate for president on the Dem
ocratic ticket, and when somne friends
of he General (7) urged 4im to ex
plain them General Adolph Meyer
admitted that he was only joking.
And General Meyer having conceded
that he was sllnging presidential
bouquets at Murphy J-who is re
puted to be the "slickest politicsan
In the State"-.hu-ply as a j kes, it
weould be exceedigly intereeting to
kte* what is Mutphy J's opinion of
General Adolph Meyer, since the
Geoera's bouquet slliaing, at thi
Louisiana statesman, were slng as
so-alled jokes. No doubt, the sug.
gestion tickled the vaulty of Murphy
J, who believed them, that General
'Adlph Meyer was in earnest and

THBB PLAIN DEMOCRATS
We are getting tired of the hyphen
ited Democrats. Why not exile for
good the Cleveland.Democrats, the
Bryan-Democrats, the gold-Demo
ratP, the silver-Democrats, the sil
ver-Republican-Democrats, the Popu
uli.t-Democrats, and get back to tihe
p!sin Democrats without any ruffi s
,n their name or malice in tbtir
jeart e-Commercial Appeal.
Ab, 'there's the rub," but do not
orget, my brother, that "the plain
Democrats" never change but stand
up to the rack, "fodder or no fod
der." And when 'the plain Demo
crats" have called on the Cleveland
Buckner-Palmer-gold-bug, silver bug
or Bryan, or other so-called Demo
crate to rally, stand and face their
Republic n enemies, Cleveland has
skulked and gone duck shooting, the
Buckner and Palmer and so-called
Democrats have given the aid and
comfort which seor.ed the success of
McKinley, but "the Democrats and
the Bryan.Democrats were loyal to
the nominee and the platform ot the
party. The plain, loyal LUmocrats
should rule. The general of a brigade,
or division, or corps, or of an army
would not be trusted with command
if be would have given aid or com
lort, directly or indirectly, to the
enemy, or who had betrayed his man
or been disloyal. The leading men
who tried to smash the plata Demo
cratic party, because they could not
control, should be seated in the rear
and be patient until they are again
called to the front.
=Yes, "we are getting tired of the
hyphenated Democrats," and insist
on the rule of the plain Democrats
without any rufla s or frills.
The Picayune says that the plat
torm adopted by the Democratie
State convention of Ohio the past
week is a real Democratic platform.
Perhaps so. We have no special
quarrel with that platform; but if the
Democratic party were in power and
should carry out this platform in
good faith, the Picayune would pro
test long and loud. The Ohio plat
form demands that all trust products
;hall be plaaed on the tree hat, and
free sugar would give the old Pie. the
political hydrophobia. - Guardian
Journal.
And there are others who, with
the Pte, would howl, sad protest loud
and long if sugar were on the free
list. It depends very much as t,
which is which.
