From the Times-Democrat of
October 21st, we learn that Capt. F
D. B. Loper, now of Provencal,
recently brought to Birmingham, F
Ala., a man named Trott, who C
murdered Jones, Sheriff of Jackson e
parish. This is an important cap- ,
ture, and Cap. is to be congratula- F
ted. We understand there is a re
ward of $300, which the Captain m
will get.
Algiers, La., was the scene of a a
destructive fire Sunday morning, b
no less than two hundred and fifty 0
hlases were burned, and over fif- v
teen hundred people rendered N
omeless. c
Thi Ire bag was the cause, and 1
a Sicilian by the name of Paul Buft
fo, was arrested and brought to r
New Orleans for safe keeping. t'
The scarcity of water with which '
to subdue the lmnes, was one rem- P
so why the conflagration was so w
disastros. Over three hundred
thousand dollars worth of proper ti
ty wuat up in amoke and ashes.
Step were at oance taken for the t
reil c the unfortunates, the ct dy
of New Or(eig alone subaribing l
urno, through Mayor Fitpatrick.

UOh ColsnlltcnlI Oh Reason !
In a leading editorial of the
Daily Picayune of the 21st inst.,
we notice the following startling
admission :
THE GREATEST DANGER OF THE AGE.
The most serious problem uf politi
r. cal and social life to-l ay. and one that
is felt in every ('hri.tian country. but
Sparticularly in republics, where the pro
r. pie are theoretically free and equal Ibe
fore the law. is the existence side tby side
n, of enormous wealth and extreme po\
0 erty.
40 And vet in the face' of such can
did adnmission the Picayune is up
holding with all its might, the for
ces that make such paradoxical
01 conditions possiblc.
o Yea, it is doing more ; it is fight
iug, belittling and laughing to
00 scorn all attempts of honest, though
humble reformers to right the.,e
- dread conditions.
The Picayune says further:
it "When statesmen, iphilaulthropi-t and
all sorts of thinkers and theorists are
er wrestling with this imperious and men
acing problem, it is not strange that it
he should have attracted the attention of
e religious teachers. It is to-day the
by cause of the one great blot upon the
religion of Christendom. and it is thne
that it should be treated by all who
in have at heart the good of tlheir fellow
r. meu."
But we believe, dear Pic., that
those most intertested, the suffer
a ers from these conditions, will be
the most likely to demand reform
and to make the sacrifices necessa
ry to secure it. This is but natu
ral. The possessorsof this "enor
mous wealth" are not likely to be
dissatisfied with the conditions
which gave it to them, nor are they
likely to go begging for a chance
to return that which has been
wrongfully obtained. No, they do
not want even to stop such wrong
ful accumulation. So if that is
what you are waiting for, friend
Pie, you will never begin to com
mence to correct the "Bane of Re
publics."
After discussing the several I
phases of the evil, the Picayune
concludes with this liberal and rath
er sage advice :
"It is time for the representatives of
religion to take up the matter. Dean
Farrier says that the only remedy is in
true religion. Who is going to sell his 1
vast estates and give -to the poor ? This
would not improve the situation. To
make men respected and self-respecting,
they must earn their wealth and place
in society. They cannot purchase honor
and respectability with riches gotten I
by oppression and dishonesty. Put a
beggar on horseback and he becomes an
offensive upstart.
To regenerate society, religion most t
work both from the top and the bottom,
or else there will be social cyclones. I
Nothing short of divine power can ar
complish it. Will men be raised up f6r
the work " ?
Yes, friend Pie., men will "be
raised up for the work," but true i
to the history of our race they will e
come from the ranks of the op- c
pressed, and not from among those 1
who fatten by the oppression. r
"Necessity is the mother of inven- d
tion" as much so in the discovery t
and development of heroes and s
statesmen as in the discovery and
development of the latent forces of
0 nature, S
And "divine power" will accom- a
plish it," but as in all other instan- t
oss it will be throlugh human in
strnmentality. So don't sit downc
before this destroyer of nations
and wait for the unnatural to hap
pen-for the "respectable element"
who "fare sumptuously every day"
of the system, to kill the goose
that lays their golden eggs; neith
er wait for a miracle of "divine
power" to start the hall rolling,
but go to work at the "bottom" of
our social fabric and remove the
senses of social decay, and avoid
the "social eyelones" which are
more dagstrous to ye and your
'"respectable element" than to the
'"mudils of ociety," because you
haveto fall and the "mud"ilr"
dea't. L

ries the rtefual of the I, )interat
it' collgres:i lIna llllmitttee of this
district one year atio, to stiullit
their candidate to a white primi:y,
f and the election of that candidlate
e in the November election iy negro I
vott'es, atre stLraws-yeta urli andt
Sbranches--tlhat show which way
the wind is Iblowing.
t Not only is the I)emocratic par
ty of this State afraid to submit
e its ticket against the Populist tick
et in a white primary, but the ma
- chine Democracy., the leaders who
now fill the offices and control the
organization of the party, will not
L. submit their chances for re-nomni
nation insole the party to a white
vote.
In proof of this latter, it is con
tidently believed that the I)t'lno
cratic State Central coimmittee
which was to have met in New Or
leans yesterday, will refuse an ur
I gent demand from its own ranks
for a white primary to decide upon
catnditlates and pl:t.form.
Verily the I)emocraltic lparty is
no longer a party of whitesuprenm
Sacy. (
How hypocritical then the cant
of that partly in favor of white t
supremacy! Hlow foolish the ntis
guided people who follow that par- n
ty, thinking that it stands as it
once stood. for white supremacy! a
Verily, the day of the hypocrite
and the fool who is gulled thereby, ii
is not passed yet.
The Populist Senatorial conven- r
tion for this district met at Sodus
last Saturday, and nominated E.
J. Gamble, of this parish, and I).
G. Freeman, of Red River, as our
candidates. Mr. (ialmble wvas nom
inated on the first ballot, receiving
every vote in the convention from
each of the fonrt parishes. MIr.
Freeman not Ibeing so well known, ti
was opposed by some other candi
dates, but tanally won the nomina
tion, and being present accepted cl
samlle.
Mr. Gamble was wired to know
if he would accept, but beimg ab- a
sent in New Orleans, and not being t
aware of any such intention on
the part of the convention, he has
not yet given his accptance. The
convention adjourned to meet tlst
inst. at same place, provided, Mr. it
Gamble did not accept.
This is a most excellent ticket,
and we believe it will win on its
merits before the intelligent lpople o
of the district. We shall have c
more to say of the gentlemen com
posing it later on. tt
Send in your Job work. We
will do it neat and cheap.
Dral of Gold. f
Weare treated to the constant
report that gold is going out of sc
the country. It is not necessary as
to report the fact in order to con- w
vey the information. Of course it er
is going out, and every dollar that w
goes out pinches us. The govern- th
ment has destroyed the silver dol- m
lar, trodden on it and despised it, w
and every time that coin is wanted, bi
either at home or abroad, gold we
must be supplied. It is a good de
dealas if a fiarmer should burn up in
his corn because he had wheat. ee
But then what is the use of talking ac
about it. The thing cannot be Il
changed while the government is ml
in such hands as it now is.-Tbe am

If such a crop as this !rings but

ceived last year on it fair yield.

Soats, pork, beef, rice, sugar and
wages ? Not that anyone has real
ized, though he may have heard of
it. Then where is our boastedll
prosperity? t
If under the gold standard there
must be worms on the coton, hail
on the wheat, blight on the oats,
cholera on the hogs, fever in the
cattle, drouth on the rice, frost on
the cane and pestilence on the hu
man to give us fair prices for their
products, then may the good Lord
and the People's party deliver us
from the gold standard.
We pity the man who has sunk
so low that he stands ready to act
as agent of corruptionists in the
work of bribing and buying vot
ers. We pity such, we say, but
we have not much faith in getting
the support of such men to help
make the laws so just that there -
will be no inducement to bribe or
buy votes, or do any other dirty
work to make a living. But we
do have faith that honest voters
in corrupt parties will see the ne
cessity of leaving their old party
and joining a party of the people.
In fiet, nearly two million have
already done so. Let us build up
an honest and just government,
where there is no incentive to cor
ruption. We can do it with your p
help.--Rural Banner. n
