A larze reptesentative meeting
of the People's Party Executive
Committee for Natchitoches p:ir
ish nas held in the Courthouse last
Saturday.
Eight wards were represented
with chairman J. W. Jones presi
dina, and Samn'l. J. Henry at the
desk.
In opening the meeting chairman
Jones made some well timed re
marks, calling the attention of the
comnlittee to thP work that lay ,1"
fore them in devising the iman111 r
in which parish and ward tickets
should be nominated, and prosvi
ding for the support and continu
ance of their central palpr, the
LOUISIANA POPULIST.
The question of the manner of
making nominations for the party
was then taken up by the introxiuc
tion of the following resolution,
byhv J. A. Tetts:
Resolved, that it In ord ered by
the 'xecuttive ('ommittee. that
there shall be held in each ward an
election for the purpose of chons
in i delegates to a parish conven
tion. to express the will of their
constitulents. or to nominalte iari'i
otier:', and that e -h vot 'r .i r:
quested to expre-s on his h::lbt
his choice for each of the can Ii
dates for eack parish oflice, and
there shall he compiled as the sense
of the people, and that in case there
1i no one rec.eives a majority, the
deleg:ttes, to the convention shall
name a man for the office after the
mlanner usuall v l)r'i5led bv c)n
e ntl onS.
lhe it forth..r lie-olved, that at
the election tor h.leg_:tes spoken of
before, each ward shall vote on.
who shall till the ward offices on
the People's pamrty ballot for th:at
ward.
This resolution was advocated by
J. A. Tetts and Judge J. N. Bur
kett, of Robeline, anl II. L. Bri
an, and was oppose'd, either in
whole, or in part, bI, W. 0. Bates,
J. R. Weaver and E. J. Gamble.
As a substitute for the motion to
adopt, II. L. Brian moved that a
committee of one from each ward
be appointed by the chair to take
charge of the resolution and frame
a plan that would harmonize the
views of the body, which motion
was carried.
The chairman aplminted the fol
lowing committee, to-wit: Ward 1,
H. L. Brian; ward 2, J. R. Wea
ver; ward 3, Jno. W. Blown;
ward 4, J. W. Tucker: ward 5,
not represented; ward 6, J. A.
Tetts; ward 7, W. O. Bates; ward
8, aot represented; ward 9, W. F.
Eversull; ward 10, represented by
proxy in H. L. Brian.
After.short deliberation the com
mittee reported to the body the
plan which appears elsewhere in
this issue. After discussion pro
and con, and some slight amend
ments, the report was adopted
unanimously, with the exception
of W. O. Bates.
This plan will be kept standing
in these columns and discussed la
ter as we have occasions.
The question of systematically
supporting the LomsIlSAA PoPu
LIr, was then taken up and dis
cussed at length, andl a plan for
same was otlered by E. J. Gamble
and adopted. This plan will be
published and discussed in our
next issue.
A committee on address was ap
pornted as follows:
E. J. Gamble, Chairman.
8. J. Henry.
P. C. Rogers.
W. F. Eversull.
H. L. Brian.
The committee then adjourned,
smbj.et to call of the chairman.
