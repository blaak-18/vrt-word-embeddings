T How Do You Like It?
Below we give an extract from
the speech of ex-Gov. Kellogg,
as reported by the Times-Demo
s.. crat, made by him to a meeting of
304$) colored men in East Baton
Rouge last Saturday. "Tom"
(':age joined Kellogg in addressing
cr. this meeting, and a child can see
that these Radical leaders, who not
only disgraced Louisiana in re
construction days, but ruined the
Republican party as weU, are sup
porting Foster as we have charged,
, and are supporting him for two
s reasons; lirst, because they get
more recognition as a colored race
from the Foster ticket than from
0 the Pharr ticket, and second be
cause they regard the Foster ticket
as standing for "sound money," or
the OOLD STANDARD.
Will the North Louisiana Dem
., ocratic papers read this and the
i. charges clipped from the Daily
Item in this issue, and then con
"' tinue to howl "negro domination ?"
nod Foster and his ticket is the move
*- mont that is attempting to re-es
tablish the negro in Louisiana poli
tics. Deny it, and have the chil
dren even to laugh at your sim
plicity.
The premises, therefore, being
that the suffrage amendment and
sound money were the leading is
sues in the campaign, and that the
defeat of the former and success
of the latter was the desideratum
to be attained by Republicans, the
important question that presented
itself was the best means of ac
complishing actual results. On
the question of finance, the Popu
lists in this State, as elsewhere,
where committed to the heresy of
free silver, while the bulk of the
Democratic party here and else
where are supposed to lean to
"sound money." Therefore, on
this issue, the regular Democrats
of Louisiana were nearer in line
with the Republicans than were
the Populists proper. On the race
question, too, the Democrats were
at least more tolerant here in East
Baton Rouge toward the colored
man in the present campaign than
the planters have shown themselves
to be, judging from recent events
in their committee meetings in New
Orleans, and otherwise, in respect
' to proposed political affiliation with
the colored men. The Democrats
of this parish, he said, were willing
to suport colored men for legisla
A- tive offices, or at any rate give them
a fair ballot and honest return
thereof, which was tantamount to
an election, as was shown by the
conditions now existing. On one
Democratic ticket in this parish
were the names of two R~publi
liean nominees for the Legislature.
On the other Democratic ticket
was one Populist and one Republi
can. The wing of the Democrat
ic party that controlled the elec
tion machinery promised, in con
sideration of the support of the
colored vote for their local ticket,
to permit an honest expression of
Oinion and a faink vote in the par
i. The other faction, evenif op
posed to the suffrage-amendment,
had not the power to give a guar
aatee of a far and full eount of
the votes. The question then pre
mted was as to the best means of
getting results. On the one hand
was the power to deliver tangible
d4 results by the election of Repub
h bear members of the Legislature
and the return of at least the en
tire Republieca vote against the
r. sufrage ameadment, while at the
c same time in the nomination of
two members of the Legislature
there is m unqualied recognition
d of the colored reem. On the other
side there might be a disposition to
do the sme thing, but there was
not the power. As the strate
amewdmemt, even shoould it be
. adopted, is saubjeot to the subee
Sqmemait aco of the Li aure, it
l witl he observeal, he mid, that it is
p a great comeemom to give the col
ored mea two members aof that
Sbody.
In order to get it they have
[ thrown'op l tothe winds and,
ae famIng over each other in
.t readilag ep the negro vote.

Never expjecteld, ch I Yet you
have been charging it for four
years.
As we have said elsewhere in
this issue, the hDemocrats have
made open an(l secret deals with
the negro; they have brought him
into prmnaries and conm entions and
caucuses ;. they have him in oflice
and on their ticket. Not only so,
but they deal only with the cor
rup and purchasable element of the
negro. They know no weapon
save bribery, fraud and force.
The Populists have 1VER at any
time or place, appointed or em
powered any committee man or set
of men to see, negotiato or confer
with any negro committee, conven
tion or individual, and all of these
things have the Democrats done at
specified times and places, and they
cann(ct and will not deny it.
If the Republicans endorsed our
ticket, it was without s, licitation
or concession on our part, and
Democrats know it as well as we.
Bro. Booth's Address.
Continued from last week.
But the most palpable falsehood
is where Mr. Booth joins the N.
O. Picayune in asserting that we
were in New Orleans between the
adjournment of the convention on
the 10th, and the meeting of the
Central Committee on the 23rd of
January, consulting with Repub
lican politicians. This is not true,
as we did not leave Natchitoches be
tween those two dates.
lie says that we hastily called my
committee together upon the ad
vice of the Republicans, etc.
If he cared to remember the
truth, Mr. Booth was present
when the State Central Committee
met in the same hall immediately
after adjournment, of our State
convention, organized, fixed Alex
andria as the place for next
meeting, came very near fixing
time of same, and the chairman
then and there announced that he
would call this meeting sometime
in January.
On the 14th day of January, we
sent eleven telegrams to as many
different papers announcing the
call of the State Central Commit
tee on the 23rd.
As to Republicans being present
at the Committee meeting, Mr.
Puckette was there, anl represent
ed that Mr. Booth would come
down, and if he ever represented
anyone else, we did not hear of it,
we had a telegram from the Su
gar planter committee disclaiming
his representation. Mr. Wilde
was also there, claiming to be
Mr. Booth's friend, and assuring
every one that Mr. Booth wanted
only half a chance to' honorably
resign.
Well, we gave him that chance,
and not only so, but an opportuni
ty to display a patriotism which
would have done much to restore
the lost confidence of his triends.
He took it not, but has continu
ed to stir up strife, interview and
quote Democratic newspapers, and
repeat his song, "I will not, I will
not resign."
He acknowledges defeat at the
polls, but pleads his case by a pre
tense of love for the party organ
ization, while his acts are fighting
that organization harder than any
words could do.
He says that we ignored hun on
our supposed visit to the city. On
our real visit there on the 29th of
January, we met him as of yore
and were publicly snubbed by him,
but survived the calamity.
He mya we supported him in
our issue of January 10th, in
which his name does not appear.
The article referred to was written
before we left home to attend the
conveution on January 8th, and in
writing it we had in mind Judge
Gaunby, who was oar personal
ehoies abefore the conveation sand
before the State Committee. We

lie wind. up by inviting his sup
posed followers to defeat under
Fosterism, to correct his mistakes.
This may be tl:e reason why he is
just now .ing deluged with 1)em
ocratic advice and sympathy.
With all this, however, there are
very few, who want to trot down
the road to defeat, knowing it be
forehand, hbence his followers on
this wild goose chase for vindica
tion of his own mistakes, will be
few and far between.
The last we heard of lion. I)on
Caffery he was blowing his fog
horn in the Senate against the free
coinage of silver, says the Clarion
Apwpal. Don is a Cleveland golld
bu. who has the great distinction
of receiving private letters fro;m
the president with the tacit under
standing that l)on shall have themn
placed at once in the newspal,,pers
anti for that honor Don shoots off
his sonorous mazoo in beh:lf of the
gold standa'rd.-Shreveport Cau
casian.
As well as we rnemel;er Caffrey
is a product of the Foster atin;in
istrati;on, which administration we
now see flying at your masthead,
Bro. Grosjean.
Foster is a muonumental fraud as
well as gold bug, and will, if elect
ed, put another goldbug in the
Senate, but we have more respect
for him than for the canting free
silver hypocrite who supports him.
We would like to know what the
Pops want to reform in Natchito
ches. There is no pariah in the
State whose affairs have been more
ably or more economically admin
istered.-Natchitoches Enterprise.
We want to reform an assess
ment rate that gives full value to
country property, and puts Kaffie's
big store at $5000, and T. and P.
railroad at $6,500 per mile.
We want to reform a tax rite
that paid into the parish treasury
as much as $40,000, while the bud
get of expenses footed up a total
of 18,000.
We want to reform a system
which places in parish offices, men
whom the people do not want, be
cause those men will divide the
salary with kinfolks of the bosses.
We are sorry for the other par
ishes if this one it the best.
To the Shreveport Judge.
Don't measure other mon's stand
ard by your own conscience. When
you say that some of the populist
leaders are "up to snutt" and are
"in the deal for what there is in
it," you want to convey the idea
that they want money. That is
your only idea of taking any ac
tive stand on any question. If you
hadl been in the American revolu
tion you would have ibeen either a
hired Hessian, or a purchased
T ou have not the least bitof
patriotism in your soul, and have
not manhood enough to imagine
others can have it. While other
people "make hay while the sun
shines," you make yours in the
dark where honest men are exclud
ed from an audience. Not many
months ago you were traveling
around the country calling Blan
chard anything but a gentleman,
but when the proper time came
you became his willing tool and
helped him to defeat the honost
friends of free silver in the demo
cratic party in this state by help
ing to keep it from being an issue.
Such men as you, are the men that
enemies of the people use, to de- 4
feat the will of the people and
keep in power the debauchers of,
liberty and the destruction of
prosperity. Do you serve for
money put up for that purpose or
is it from pure ignoranoe I If for
the former that is the reason you
think every man is for sale, if i
from the latter we can excuse your
want of respect for other people,

o so, and so. McCormick has not
the grit to come out and say that
any individual of the Populist pa;.
ty has received money from any
one for unclean purposes, for that
e individual might ¢o to McCormick
y and demand a personal retraction,
and this would not be so funny as
it is to scatter lies by inuendo
il against squads of men. He by
inference, slanders, because he
n dares not make charges in which
n names and dates figure. He states
that such and such things are re
ported.
e Now, Mr. McCormick, if you
[. have any ground for your state
. ments be manly enough to give
pames, dates and all, or be manly
nough to shut your slanderous 4
i mouth against men, who would not
stoop to attack others from the
I bush, as you are doing, but will
meet you in the open, at any time
t you seek it.--Our Battle Flar.
n It was a beautiful spectacle in
a Baton Rouge when some 2000 drun
s ken, noisy negroes paraded the
streets of that city yelling them
u selves hoarse for Pharr. Yet we
are told that there is no combine
a with the nigger.-Natchitoches

The certainty of defeat has
f crazed our poor unfortunate neigh
e bor, and now he reads everything
r backwards. The "2000 drunken
a noisy negroes paraded the streets" a
e and they were headed by Kellogg r
and Cage, and were "yelling them
r selves hoarse" for FORTrR ! The
Times-Democrat is our authority.
- The attention of the white su
j premacy Populists is directed to
t the efforts made by their candidate,
Pharr, to have negroes appointed
on the campaign committee.-
Natchitoches Enterprise.
t At present Kellogg, Demas and
Cage, are conducting Foster's cam
paign, we wonder who put them on
the Democratic campaign conm
r mittee.
r About the only creditable thing
the !'emocratic party can do now
f is to permit itself to be buried.

Spresumption that "the king can
