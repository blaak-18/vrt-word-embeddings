This time Mr. Elkins concluded that
he would rather walk and hastily got

Paris has been the home of "black

to the Figaro, the subtle art of black

of refinement by the use of the carrier
pigeon. Thus the inventor: "It is very

The King James Bible.
ln.telling of the lineage of the Eng
lish Bible in Harper's Magazine H. W.
Iioare pays a tribute to the King James
version and the scholars who made it:
"Its scholarship marked a conspicu
ous advance even on that of Geneva,"
he says. "Its English was the people's
English, yet refleting at the saune time
all the glow and glory of a period never
surpassed In the whole history of let

to them with a deep sense of devout
responsibility, King .ianes' revisers
provided for it a setting of imperishable
beauty. In strength and tenderness, in
its sustained note of nobility and so
lemnity, In its wondrous pathos, in its
chastened sobriety, simplicity and di
rectness, in the semblance of inevita
bleness under which the elaborate art
of it lies concealed, in its haunting ca
dences and rhythms, the richness and
power and grandeur of our native
tongue have been enshrined forever

Americans who have stopped in Par
is long enough to keep house find liv

States. Meat Is dearer, but the cuts
are so fine that there is not so much
waste, according to a writer in the De

about 40 cents apiece and salmon $1 a
pound. , Bread is about the same in
price as here and tee and coffee more
expensive, while fuel is very high, coal
and wood being frequently sold in small
quantities and gas costing about $1.50

Cannon as a Farmer.
When Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois
was married, he was in decidedly poor
circumusta nces, a td him anot her, an eco
nomical Qua k eress, who was anxious
to have hint found a household, said
to him, "Joseph, now that thee is mar
ried thee must get thee a cow, a pig
and a hive of bees." "I took mother's
advice," relates Mr. Cannon. "I tried
to milk the cow, but she kicked ae
over, and I had to give that up as r
had job. 1 tried to feed the calf, and
it butted ine all around the yard and
tore tamy clothes nearly off. When the
bees got ready to swaran. I thought I
would go out among them like father
used to do and swarit them. The bees
got amuoang te--crawled up under my
shirt and stung tue in a hundred dif
ferent places-atd 1 I had to let thet go.
The only tluing I could get along with
at all was tue pig. I could feed that,
scratch its sides, and it would grunt. I
got it good and fat and gave it away
to a farmer. I didn't have the heart
to kill it."
Browning and the Bast.
Thomas Hardy says that while in
Florence he and the late Mrs. Baxter
"Leader Scott," who has just died,
went to see the place where Browning
laid the scene of his poem, "The Statue
And the Bust." The statue in question
is, of course, that of the Grand Duke
Ferdinand I. "Having seen the figure,"
writes Hardy, " ye looked for the bust,
but were informed by an obliging wait
er standing at a door hard by that it
had unfortunately been taken down
from a particular spot in the palace
facade, -which he pointed out. He add
ed luminous details, and -1 gave him a
lira for his information. On the first
Sunday after my return to London I
met Browning, and he was Interested
to hear of the Incident. 'But that wait
er" he added, with a hearty laugh.
'Why, I Invented the bust!' "
