BUD MADE UP THE FEUD.
a Touohlng Story of -the Tennes
see Mountains.
HOUH Bud Prock
had been in bed for
several hours, he had
scarcely slept at all.
Midnight having
passed, he was roused
` by a heavy tread in
the next room and
the sound of his fa
ther's voice.
"To-morrow night
is the time," he. heard his father say.
"We-musta do the the job then. There'll
be nobody there but Rube and his
mother, and, mabbe. that there par
son. I tell ye, Burge Spillman, it was
Babe Hawkins as had the reveno cut
up my still three weeks ago. It was
him and the rest as run your son off
to the nation last winter, on charge
of that shootin' scrape he- got into
down on Smoky Run. Now is a good
time for us to get even."
"That young preacher you speak of
and the Hawkieses are some kin, I
reckon," remarked Burge Spillman.
"Hit minds me, too, as he and your
Bud seem to be master thick. I've seen
them together more'n once. They was
at the Borum gap to-day."
"Long with that Parson Sneed, was
he? I'll wear him out if I hear any
more such tales. I believe I'll wear
him out anyhow."
At this point Bud became so agi
tated he knocked over an ox yoke that
was leaning against the wall. Then
Bud heard his father rise, open the
door and approach the bed.
"Was you a-listenin'?"
"I couldn't hardly help it, when you
talked so loud," returned Bud, whose
fears would hardly carry him to the
point of a downright lie. "Besides, I
ain't deaf."
"Well, then, you've heard; and I
reckon you know. But you 'tend to
what I say." John Prock struck the
table until the glasses on it rattled.
"If I hear of you cheepin' a word to
anyone-anyone. I say!-I'll wear the
very hide off'n ye. D'ye hear?
"Hold up your head and look at me!
Don't you be seen 'long with that
Preacher Sneed no more. I'll baste you
for that if it happens agin."
"You know I wish you well, father,"
he said. "I've nobody else to care for
since mother was put away. But I
wish you would give up this thing,
father. You and them Hlawkins' have
been a-jowering for months. WVhat
good do it do?"
"What thing? Is the boy crazy?"
Prock gazed at Spillman in simulated
surprise.
"You know what, father." Bud
hesitated, for he had heard nothing ex
plicit..
"Listen at the little fool! He'll be
makin' out next that his pap wants to
kill somebody. Look here, Bud. You
get to bed, and quit botherin' your
head. I reckon I know what I'm
about."
Bud had neither brothers nor sisters.
Since his mother's death, owing to his
lameness and sensitive temperament,
he became a creature of retiring habits,
having no intimates, and but few asso
ciates.
The morning following the events
just related, John Prock shouldered
his rifle and left the house with scarce
ly a word for Bud, who, growing
lonely, wandered off into the woods
later on.
Ought he to warn some one against
something? Or was he in honor bound
to hold his tongue? lie was still de
bating the question in his mind, rather
aimlessly, when the crack of a rifle was
followed by the appearance of a gentle
faced, slender young man, carrying sev
eral dead squirrels and a gun on his
shoulder.
"Why, Bud," said Parson Sneed, "I
hardly expected to see you so far from
home to-day."
Yet the boy held his peace, and after
a time the young man strolled off. Bud,
1i
THRE DOOR WAs BURST OPEN.
still undecided and more vaguely dis
tressed than ever, dreaded to go home.
He wandered yet farther away, until
at sundown he was considerably nearer
the Hawkins cabin than his own.
Instead of turning homeward, he lay
down at a point where, through the
gathering darkness, he could see the
firelight within the open door of the
Hawkins house. The road leading from
his own home passed through the glen
just below his position.
The stars came out and the night
wind sighed gently. A new fear came
over the lad. Perhaps his father might
suspect. from Bud's prolonged absence,
that the boy was up to "some mis
chief." Yet he waited on wearily.
As the moon rose higher it whitened
the trail for a long distance. Looking
down this he noticed a cluster of dark
objects moving round a shoulder of a
ridge in the direction of his own home.
The Hawkinses were his family ene
mies, yet Parson Sneed, his friend, was
with them. The boy's sensitive heart
revolted from the thought of violence
and bloodshed.
He had nearly a mile the start of
those crawling objects, and but half a
mile to go in order to reaoh Hawkins'
eabSl,. He aeanbled down ainto the
'ea4ts4J.Agtu.e oawuer witb *tvgO
of which he would not have bees cape
ble in calmer moments.
Inside the Hswklns' house were Rabe
Hawkins, his mother, the young divin
ity student and two half-grown girls,
Rabe's sisters. Bad Frock entered, his
thin face drawn and pale, and his usu
ally sad eyes filled with a strange,
eager light. Fixing his gaze on Mr.
Sneed, he exclaimed:
"They're a comin' up the road, par
son. They've got their guns, too.
I wanted to give you warning to-day,
but, somehow, I couldn't get the words
out."
Rabe seemed to understand at once.
He took down his rifie and produced a
couple of revolvers from a bureau
drawer, one of which he offered to
Sneed, who refused it with a shake
of the head, as he led Bud to the fire.
A sound of rapidly-approaching foot
steps was now audible on both sides of
the cabin. Then a door was violently
burst open. In rushed John Prock, ase
companied by three other men, one of
whom was Burge Spillman.
The sight of Hawkins armed and ap
parently expecting an attack appeared
to take them by surprise. Prock no
ticed Bud at the side of Mr. Sneed.
"I'll remember vou for this, Bud,
when we get back home," he said, in a
fierce, grating tone that indicated vol
umes to the lad.
He threw up his rifle suddenly, but
the young parson placed himself bold
ly before Rabe, who had also cocked
his own weapon.
"Stranger," said Prock, "it's a good
plan not to meddle in other people's
consarns. But if you're for Hawkins,
say the word."
"Father!" exclaimed Bud, hobbling
forward and grasping his parent's
arm boldly, "before you do harm to
that man, take a wood look at him.
See if you ain't seen him somewhere
else. Have you fur got the log camp
"WVHAT'S TIHE MATTER WITH THE KID,
ANYWAY?"
down at Grip's gorge, father?" urged
Bud. "Father-you must not--l--I-
you--"
"What!" at last Prock exclaimed,
staring at Sneed. "It can't be him.
Yes-seems like you favor him power
ful."
"Right you are, Mr. Frock. I am
the man who nursed you when you
had the smallpox that winter. I
should have made myself known to
you before, but for the unfortunate
state of feeling between you and my
Cousin Rabe here."
Frock, who had been gulping down
his amazement as if a lump were
sticking in his throat, turned to his
followers excitedly.
"The feller's right," said he. "I owe
my life to him, I reckon. lie stood by
me in camp, when every one else as
knowed me run. If he says quit, our
job is over for to-night, boys. That's
all I've got to say."
"Father," pleaded Bud, "shako
hands with Mr. Sneed and Rabe."
"lIere you are again!" shouted Frock,
not sorry to find some object on which
to vent his baffled wrath. "Always a
pnttin' in your oar!"
lie shook his son roughly and pushed
him away.
Next morning Bud did not rise as
usual to prepare the breakfast after
the father had made the fire. Frock
called him, but, receiving no reply,
went into Bud's room and shook the
boy, whose flesh felt cold.
Frock bent down. Bud's eyes were
half closed and the pupils set unnatur
ally. His thin face looked wan and
death-like.
"Wake up, Bud. What's the matter
with the kid, anyhow?"
All at once it dawned upon him that
Bud might be dying. He rushed into
the other room and roused Spillman,
who had remained there that night.
"Run!" he exclaimed. "Fetch some
body. Tell the neighbors to run over.
Hurry! Don't you see Bud's dyin'?"
Spillman left the house at a run.
John Frock gathered his son's light
figure in his arms and rocked to and
fro. A vivid consciousness of his ovwn
brutal neglect and Bud's truthfulnests
and affection had come over his hard
nature.
Minutes that seemed like hours
passed before Spillman came back
with Parson Sneed and Babe Hawkins,
whom he had met, and, in his anxiety,
had persuaded to accompany him back.
Sneed examined Bud carefully and
pronunced him to be seriously though
not dangerously ill. Hawkins surveyed
his old enemy with gradually soften
ing features.
At last Bud's respirations grew easy
and regular. His lips lost their death
like hue, his skin grew war1, and
finally his eyes opened. When he saw
Hawkins and his father both bend
ing over him anxiously, he made a
feeble movement as if to join their
hands.
The two men divining Bud's mean
ing looked at each other, then Prock
suddenly reached forth his hand.
"Let's shake, Rabe," said he. "I've
just found out what a son is, by seein'
Bud in this here fix. If Bud wants nE
to be friends with you I'm willim' now.
And morc'n that I'll get down on my
knees to prove it, if necessary."
And thus peace was permanently
made.--WUlaz Petrry )reara, a 43e.s

IN THE ELECTRICAL WORLD.
-Overland- telegraphic communica
tion between India and China has at
last been established by the junction
of the Burmese and Chinese lines on
the 16th of March.
-Thomas A. Edison is very fond of
children. He delights to show them
through his workshops and to mystify
them with his magic. To them he is
the real wizard he is often called.
-Dr. Siemens, the Berlin electrician,
dwells in a house which is known
throughout Germany as "the wonder
of Wansee." It is fitted from roof to
cellar w. .h electricity. The din
ing-room, kitchen and wine cellar are
all connected by means of a minature
railway.
-A lawyer in New Jersey, wishing
to attend a sale of real estate went to
Bridgeton, only to find that the sale
was just beginning at Vineland, twelve
miles away. Nothing daunted, he
went to the telephone, put in his bid
by its means, and captured the prop
erty. Then he took the next train and
signed the necessary papers.
-The electric launch on the Wallkill
river, at Midway park, Middletown. N.
Y., is to obtain its power this year
from a trolley circuit. A wire will be
strung over the river and will be at
tached to a feed wire. There isnorea
son, says the electrical, engineer, why
this simple method shoud not be very
sucdessful, and lead to the introduction
of other trolley boats on narrow
streams.
-The Brooklyn bridge trustees, it
appears, have at last introduced the
electric light on the bridge cars; and
now that the cars are so lighted the
electrical engineer thinks it would
seem to be but a short and easy step
toward operating them by electric mo
tors. All the conditions, it says, are
favorable for this, and with the over
head work now in position a trial of
the method could be carried out with
only slight expense.
-The Philadelphia Traction Co. is
making arrangements with a view to
securing palace cars for "trolley par
ties" during the coming summer. They
will be leased to parties for the even
ing. Arrangements will be made to
serve luncheon on board the cars.
Music will be furnished. It is also pro
posed to have electric launches placed
in the waters of Spring Garden, in the
vicinity of Long bridge, and the waters
at Fort McHenry and the mouth of the
Patapsco.
-A manufacturer in Europe did not
find satisfaction in any of the usual
methods for the lighting of his cloth
mills He triedgas jets, arc-lights
and incandescent lamps, all of
which failed tosatisfy him, because
they either did not give light
enough, or too much light, or
cast shadows. He finally painted
the walls of his room white, and be
neath a certain number of arc-lights
suspended reflectors. This threw the
light up to the white ceiling, from
which it was reflected to the room be
low, and this method of lighting is re
ported to have been a success.-Hard
ware.
-An enormous business is said to
have been done recently at French
fairs by a man who professed to sell a
rat powder that was perfectly harm
less, and that struck rats dead on the
spot. In order to convince the skep
tical, the man first of all powdered a
slice of bread with the stuff, and ate a
piece of it himself. Then he put the
remainder under a glass case in which
a rat was kept in captivity. The rat
went to eat the bread and instantly
fell dead. At ten cents a box the pow
der went off like hot cakes, and the
lucky proprietor of the specific was in
a fair way to make a fortune. But the
police, who in France are very active
in protecting the people from fraud,
looked into the matter and found that
the powder was nothing but ordinary
sugar. They also discovered that the
case was connected with a powerful
electric battery, and that the moment
the rat touched the bread, the current
was turned on, and it was thus that
his death was brought about. The
man was arrested at the fair of Albi

CAUSES OF HEADACHE.
eme oft Them Are me Sipe as to be Easily
Avolded.
Malaria brings on'a headache that is
periodical in its character, coming on
at a certain time every day or every
other day. One to five grains of qui
nine every three hours until the ears
begin to buzz will give relief, but it is
a better plan to get away from the
malaria district.
Breathing foul air; sleeping in small,
crowded and poorly ventilated rooms;
working in similar places; sitting in
crowded or poorly ventilated halls or
lecture rooms, etc., etc., also bring a
headache. The remedy which natur
ally suggests itself is to get out into
the fresh air and to avoid the cause in
the future.
Reading too long at a time and over
study bring on a dull headache and
listlessness.
Defective eyes or ill-fitted glasses of
ten cause headache, accompanied by
sickness of the stomach. There are
thousands and thousands of such per
sons who ought to wear glasses, but
who do not know it, and some who do
know it, but who are foolish enough to
refuse to wear them.
Diseased teeth are also a fruitful
cause. There may be no pain whatev
er in the tooth, the pain being referred
to some part of the head or face. This
is a fact that many are slow to believe,
and some even refuse to consult a den
tist, even when so advised by a physi
cian.
Lack of accustomed stimulants.
Those who drink strong coffee or tea
at each meal often have headache when
deprived of these stimulants, and
should learn to do without them as
soon as possible.
Excessive use of tobacco in any form
brings on neuralgic pains in the head,
which resist treatment so long as the
use of tobacco is continued.
Constipation of the bowels often
causes splitting headaches, which are
soon relieved by a dose of salts. The
headache will return, however, if the
constipation continues.
An overloaded stomach is sometimes
a cause.
Failure to get meals at the accus
tomed hour often brings on a feeling
of discomfort in the head that will be
relieved by a good, square meal. This
may be the case even though the vic
tim does not feel hungry.
WVorry, sorrow, grief and care are
also causes, as are mental strain and
too close application to business by
stenographers, dentists, students, busi
ness men, etc. For this kind of head
ache, which is persistent and distress
ing, and impairs the victim's useful
ness. there is nothing so beneficial as
bicycle riding. After a ride of from
fifteen minutes to a half hour the head
ache will be gone, the victim be invig
orated, his faculties brightened and he
will not be fatigued like one who has
walked. No other invention has done
so much for suffering humanity in the
estimation of thousands who have been
freed from pain by its use. Salicylate
of soda in twenty-grain doses will help
those who haven't a bicycle.
Tumors of the brain, pressure on the
nerves and diseases of the nerves cause
severe and excruciating headaches
which can only be relieved by the sur
geon.
The old-fashioned sick headache is
usually accompanied by some derange
ment of the stomach, and should be
treated accordingly.
Heavy overcoats which bear too
heavily on the point of the shoulder,
shirt bands of collars which fit too
closely around the neck, stiff hats
which press too hard on some part of
the head, hats which are loaded down
with heavy trimmings, are all causes
of headaches.
A cold in the head will cause a dull
headache in the forehead just over the
eyes.
Too much hair, by preventing the
cooling of the head, often brings on a
headache that will be relieved by a
visit to a barber. Women, however,
often suffer from this because it is not
the fashion to wear short hair. Wear
ing close-fitting hats or caps which are
not ventilated act the same way in
warm weather. Bicycle riders often
suffer from this same cause in hot
weather. They may think caps look
better, but a well-ventilated helmet
protects the head and back part of the
neck from the direct rays of the sun,
and the current of air passing over the
head prevents it from getting too hot.
Katzenjammer, the headache follow
ing a debauch, will often yield to a
dose of salts.
From the above it will be seen that
most headaches are brought on by the
violation of some of nature's laws, and
we should bear this in mind when seek
ing a remedy.
Of the various drugs recommended,
quinine, bromideof potassium and sali
eylate of soda are the most beneficial
and least harmful--Cincinnati Com
mercial.
Dread and flutter Plates.
"Are bread and butter plates in use
yet, and are the little spreaders the
proper thing to use with them?" is a
query which reaches this department.
The reply to the first question is made
that they indubitably are, although it
will not be diffcult to find some au
thorities announcing that they are not.
These little plates have been found to
be a great convenience, and experience
shows that when such is the case
enough sensible persons are alnrays
found who will continue the use of a
convenience to keep it in fashion. The
bone plates which preceded them were
not nice in suggestion and were speed
ily abandoned. A place $for a piece of
bread and a separate small knife with
which to put a bit of butter on it is, in
lieu of complicating the service of a
meal, a distinct simplifier; it is more
useful in the one-maid establishment,
even, than in the more elaborate ones,
for it assists in the matter of serving.
It is a mistake to have these plates too
large, but it is not a mistake to have
them.-St,. Louis Republic.

RATS AND MOTHS.
Rules for Warfare Upon Them Darlsg
Spring Honue-Cleaning.
In the spring there is a wholesale
resurrection of domesticated insects
that fill a house-keeper's mind with
f'orebodings.
Furnace fires have not only kept the
family warm all winter, but also in
numerable cozy mice nests, the larvae
of moths and the irrepressible cock
roach. At the first warm, sunshiny
day every one of these small abomina
tions are up and doing unless a strong
hand of resistance is put forth at their
first active demonstration.
This is accomplished by using naph
tha and benzine liberally on mat
tresses, pillows, etc., that are sunning
in the back yard.
Where a movable wooden washstand
becomes infected with croton bugs or
cockroaches there is a sovereign cure
in washing it out with hot suds, leav
ing it open to dry in strong sunlight
and then soaking every joint of the
wood with pure ammonia. To guard
against any return to the old haunts
cut a few squares of stiff brown wrap
ping pape, paint them lightly with
mucilage, dust over heavily with borax
and lay squares in the drawers and
cabinet.
For moths there has at last been
found a present preventive. If a florist
can not supply one with sprays of
dried English lavender the corner
apothecary will be sure to keep it in
packages; when on closet shelves, in
drawers and trunks it will defend one's
woolen things against the most aggrse
ire onslaughts of the enemy.
