good word for his town and parish,
for which he predicts a brilliant fu
ture. Being ah of the pioneer set
tlers of Rayne he is in a position to
appreciate the steady and substan
tial growth that the town has ex
perienced if late years. Rayne has
never been "boozied" but it has en
terprising citizens and a splendid
back country which can not fail to
make it one of the best towns in the
State.
An Excelftki Dinner.
A number of convivial gentlemen
met at the home of Mr. Edrond
Mouton last Sunday and partook of
a most excellent dinner. And when
it is known that the expenses were
borne by Mr. Kruttschnitt, of the
Southern Pacific Company, the
reader will wonder how that was
possible?
Some time ago a car-load of cot
ton caught fire and the officers
of the train not being able. to save it
abandoned the wholeload, consisting'
of about 50o bales, dear Mouton's
Switch. Mr. Edmond Mouton and
a number of his neighbors who hap
pened to be near the track thought
the cotton could yet be saved and
with commendable energy they
worked until a large portion of it
was rescued from the fire. Mr.
Mouton wrote to Mr. Kruttschnitt
telling hem \hht the- cotton which
had been abandoned had been
saved and was in good order.
Mr. Kruttschnitts thanked him
and his friends for their kind
ness, and a few days ago stop
ped in his private car at the
switch a&td thanked the gentlemen
again, at the same time handing
them a check for an amount suffi
ciently large to pay for the dinner!
mentioned in this ~itic:le- nd this
is how the citizens in the neighbor
hood of Mouton's Switch enjoyed a
dinner at Mr. Kruttschnitts' expen
ses.
A First-class Hotel.
We have heard some very high
praises of the splendid management
of the Orleans Hotel by Mrs. A.
D'Orsay. This lady hbt had ex
tisive e*perience in hotel keeping
and knows exactly how to provide
for her boarders and consequently
never fails to please themi. It is
therefore not surpr;sing to hear the
boarders of this hotel speak so
highly of the excellent treatment
they receive. The Gazette recom
mends this hotel as first-class in
every particular.
Dance at Carencro.
We return thanks. to the young

Double Railroad Track.
We learn from the Iberian that
the Southern PlAcfl1l Company has
comnienced building an- additional
track from New Orleans to Lafa
yette, It is intended to build
twetitrfive miles each year until the
road is completed. Judge Parker
son, of this place, has been nego
tiating for the right of way forty
feet wide from Olivier to Bayou
Sale, thi. portidon of the road being
Iuill frst as it is there that trains
going opposite directions generally
meet. This looks, says the Iberian,
ks if the Southern Pacific had firm
faith in this country, bounty or no
boiunty, that it should be preparing
to rio a larger butiie*$..

paring a program for the enter

not fail to be intensely interesting
to young and old alike. The word
"fail" is ndS in Father LaFbrest's
vocabulary, 'hnd whenever he fs rin

cess is assured. He proposes to
furnish the people of Carencro arnd
adjoining country with some whole
some and instructive pleasure and
that he will hucceed is showin by the

veniently short distance from this
town. . For fur'th'er particulars apply

Let it be Stopped.
The con'iuct of some people at
the Opera house is, to put it mildly,
an unbearable nuisance. For in
stance at the last entertenmnet
some persons "vere ridiculous in
their demonstrations and made a
foolish display O6f themselves, show
ing that they hal1 no respect for the
ladies present, blut on the contrary,
seemed to delight in annoying those
who desired to 'enjoy the perform
ante. We believe that some steps
should be taken to preve'it the re
currence Of this eprehentibb~~ prac
tice.
The Ennnma 'Warren Compatny.
The popular actress, Miss Emma
WVarren and her company will ap
pear at Fali's Opera House on the
x7th instant in the play of ",Hen
rietta." The rNew Ibleria Enter
prise speakls very highly of this
company. It says:
The one week's engagement of
the Emma Warren Co., concluding
with to-morrow night's presentation
of "East Lynne," has been one of
the artistic successes of the season.
Appearing against stiong attractions,
both present and future, Miss War
ren has draivn good h':ites, the
audiences increasing with each suc
cessive performance. A more
meritorioti, talented and personally
agreeable theatrical combination
has never c6me to New Iberia, and
it will leavre behind most pieasant
recollecttions. Miss Warren is a
talented youtmg actress, with a bril
lian future, and one can but wish
her the acme of fame in her chosen
profession. Mvr. Garside, the mu
sical directoof the company and
his excellent iorps of musicians de
serve the highest enconiums. Do
not forget that Uhe engagement
closes with "EaSt Lynne to-mosrow
night. .
The Right Kind of Talk.
A drumnier for a printing house
in a certain city Solicited some job
work from Mr. B. Willer, one cf
our merchants, the other day, but
did not get the order, although Mr.
Willer wanted sohie work done at
the time. Mr. Willer said that he
preferred patronizing home industi'y
and would give his work to this
office, becausC those connected witil
the Democat-Journal spent thei
money here and deserved patronage.
Mlr. Willer in this affair showed the
spirit of a enterprising and i ublic
spirited man, yne who is willing to
assist his neighbors in their busi
ness. 'rho- connected with otii"
office spend $zooo or $zoo iri thb
place yearly, and for that reason
alone, if there iwrere ng other, they
are entitled to hmore recognition
than they get. The paper is ex

some of those most interested do
not think our services are ,orthy of
recognition. -bemocrat-Jou rnal.

has beh spehding a few wieeks, for
thie ~icnefil of his health. Mr.
Brown hasehtfirely recoveied fr6im
his late indisposifiiih.
'Vhile Carencro. has suffered se
verely fr6ms the very low prices of I
products, partichlarly cane and cot
ton; still our people are in a sense
more 'fortunate than many in 6thir
localities. We lost comparatively
litile cane, while it is generally
known that elsewhere many farmers 1
lost their entire crops. Our local
mill or the Carencro Sugar Com
pany, and the Huron Refinery, did
'all ih their power to sad} the crop.
Mr. Robichaux, formerly of I
Breaux Bridge, has located in our
'town, 'and Is making preparations
for the establishment of a 'good
hotel here. This is something that
has been long needed, and we are
pleased to see that we are to have it
at last. Mr. Robichaux is a very
genial and popular gentleman, and we
feel sure that he will be re'arded
for his enterprise. In connection
with his hotel, he intends to con
duct a first-class livery-stable.
Mr. John R. Jones paid a flying
visit to New Orleans last week.
There are lots of peculiar people in
this world, who seem void of knowl
edge of their own peculiarifies.
The new Catholic church is pro
gressing steadily, and so far has re
ceived'the full approval of all w.,o
are competent to judge of such 1
"work. When completed it will be I
t-he lar est and finest edifice of its
kind for everal parishei round.
Taking everything into considera
tion the 'Carencro Sugar Company
did fairly well this season. It is
rumored that it is the intention of
this company to add a Sugar mak- t
ing outfit to their plant the coming
year; and instead of shipping their
syrup to refineries, they will make
T"heir own sugar.
Huron Refinery made over 7oco I
barrels of sugar this season. Mr.
Jno. R. Jones has proven him
self a very iable mianager, and nrade i

The 9th and xoth of February will
be gala d-ays in 'Crencro. Arch- l
bishop Janssens of New Orleans
will confer 'the sacrament of con
firmation upon a large number of
children. He wvill on Sunday', bless
the corner stone of the new Church.
This is at all times very interesting
and impressive. The church com
mittee taking advantage of the
event, have prevailed upon good t
Father Laforest to give a grand '
fair, where not only our own people, i
but those from neighboring parishes
may come and witness the cere
mony; and at the same time share
the pleasures 'of the day. Sunday s
night February ro, Archbishop c
Janssens will deliver a lecture on t
"The early days of Louisiana,"
which is replete with interest to
lovers of our State. A fine coh
cert on Saturday night to which the t
talent of our neighbortig towns

of thefeatures of the entertainment.
!The lecture, fair, and concert, will t
be held in the new church building, 1
which can legitimately be used or r

A Plea for Pure Milk.
To the Editor of The Gazette.
Why our milk men, the world
over, iersist int diluting th'eir nice,
rich milk with so much water as 'to
cause such universal complaint?
WVould not ordinary ousiness policy,
if no't honesty, dictate a more
straightforward and honorable
course ? Is it not downright
theft to sell a man water instead of
milk? Almost every household has
a capacious cistern from which a~t
inexhaustible supply of pure water
may be obtained by simply turnitng
the faucet, without money and with
out price, but it seems to be the
rule among milkmen to attempt the
usurpation of the functions of this
time-honored institution. I pro
pose, Mr. Editor, we call a conven
tion to remedy this crying and
watery evil. Yours, RIGiHT.

A Brilliant WVcdding.
The following, taken from the
,iaton Rouge Daily Advocate, is an
account of the marriage of ofir
townsman, Morris Rosenfield, of
which mention was made in the last
issue of the Gazette:
A beautiful wedding took place
last Sunday evening at Arbroth,
Wiest Baton Rouge parish, at the
home of Mr. S. Abramson, a re
spected and highly esteemed citizen
of that parish. Firiends and rela
tives from afar and near gathered at
the hospitable home to witness the
announced marriage of Mr. and
Mrs. Abramson's lovely and accom
plished youing daughter, Miss Dora,
to one of Lafayette's prominent
young buisness men, Mlr. Morris
Rosenfield. The parlor was elabor
?aely decorated with flowers and
evergreens. Beneath an arch artis
tically decorated stood Rabbi M.
Klein at the hout of seven awaiting
the bridnM party. The silence of
the throng was the signal of their
arrival. The Mendelssohn wedding
march by Miss Grossman, an ac
compl)lishedl young lady of new Or
leans greeted them at the parlor
door in the following order: Mr.
Abe Abramson and sister, Miss
Rosa; Mr. and Mrs. A. Kaufman,
of Baton Rouge; Mrs. S. Abramson,
mother of the bride, leaning on the
arm of the handsome groom, gently
followed by Mr. S. Abramson ibith
h.s lovely bride-daughter dressed in
an elaborate bridal costume ot white
silk and French lace, diamond orna
ments covered with wreath and veil.
When the bride antd groom stood
side by side the beautiful J.wishi ser
vice was conducted i. a m~iost s.lemn
and i;mpressive uman ner by Rabbi
1rlein frjnm l.aton Il-,ige. Words ,f
-d'ice andl holiness were spoken by
the cloquent minister, and after
pronouncing them mnan and wife
congratulatitns .and good wishes
were in order by thel riimerous
friends and relatives in attendance.
Telegrams from absent friends were
read; then a maich formed to the
dining oom where a table laden
with the delicacies of the season
awaited the party. The menu was
excellently arranged by Mr. E. L.
Herdon, of Nelson and Mr Blerdon of
this city, assIstn.d by skilled and
gentler hands. After all had fairly
feasted toasts were declared in or
der and Rabbi Klein atose and
offered a feeling and happy toast.
-e.l whs fqllowed by Drs. Matthews
tid Sewell, Messrs. J. Grossman,
Reams, Marks, Miss Dreyfas, Mr.
Abramson and bthers. The most
kouching tribute wvb *he one offered
by Mr. Abe Abramson, brother of
the happy young bride.
