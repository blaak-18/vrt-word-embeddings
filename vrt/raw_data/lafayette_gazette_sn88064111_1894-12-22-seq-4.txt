What is the
matter with "the
country ? That
is a thunderin
big question,
and I reckon
if one man was
to take the job
of sendin in the
right and prop
er answer he
would need a
head as long as
a flour barrel,
asbig as a ham
per basket and as level as a squash.
But I have heard so much talk
here of late to the extent that the
country is goin right on to the dogs and
the devil till I put in to find somebody
that could tell what is the matter. I
have talked with various and sundry
different people and got various and
sundry different answers and opinions
in the case. Whereas I have finally at
last come to the conclusion that if there
is anything in particlar thematter with
the country the common ran of other
people don'~ know much more about the
wherefores and the whenceness thereof
than I do. But at any rates it can't do
no harm to give out the opinions in
public as they have been give to me in
private.
'The Good Lord Is in It.
About the oldest and best and straight
est and cleanest man anywheres in the
Rocky Creek country is old Parson Gabe
Stribblin. He is a full blood Uncle to
Handy and the other Stribblin boys,
though you mought not think it on first
blush from what you have heard me
tell concernin the boys. Hut if you
was to come down and live for fifty
years in the same settlement with him
you never would hear anything contra
rywise to the good name and general
standin of Parson Gabe Stribblin. So
as he was returnin back home from a
round of his circuit one day last week
he rode by to pass the time of day with
me, and I got his opinions on the coun
try, in general and 5 cent cotton in par
ticlar.
.-The good Lord is in it, Rufus"-says
the old man slow and cautiouslike
'-certain as the creek runs down stream
the good Lord is in it. For more than
twenty years to my certain knowledge
and belief He has been trvin His level
best to show the people the errors of
their ways and bring them to their sen
ses and stop them from plantin so ever
lastin much cotton. Now I can remem
ber way back yonder in my young days
when we didnt know nothin about such
a thing as caterpillars and boll worms
to eat up the cotton. In them days
cotton went right on bloomin and grow
in and tmakin right slap up till frost
come to kill it down. I can remember
mighty well when we use to have sev
eral bales of what we called frost-bit
cotton every year-cotton that come on
late with the top crop and got caught
and damaged by the frost. You never
hear tell of any frost-bit cotton nowa
days. In the run of time the people
got to makin so much of it till the good
Lord sent the worms to eat off the
leaves and destroy the top crop, where
as the whole entire crop is generally
open and picklen out now, before the
first good frost falls. But it looks like
the people thought they knowed better
than the Lord. and so they went right
on plantia more and more cotton every
year. The good Lord also sends the
grass, and the people they pitch in and
kill the grass in ordermnent to raise cot
ton, whilst at the same time the grass
is worth more than the cotton if it was
tended to right and cut and cured for
hay. lie has likewise also sent the
drouths and the floods and the rust, but
it didn't stop the people frpm their
headlong fool ways in plantin more
cotton. So now at last it seems like He
has tried a new plan and fixed the sea
sons so the people would make more
cotton than the country can use in its
business. It is now down to 5 cents a
pound and it wont be no ways surprisin
to me if it keeps on goin down hill.
The good Lord is in it. I tell you, and
He is more than probable to have His
way, Rufus, if iHe has to run her down
to three cents a pound. The people
have been mnakin too much cotton and
consequentially not enough of other
things, and the time is about ripe now
for the country to make a change in the
general order of business."
Aunt Nancy Comes Next.
Right up next to the preacher I will
put the opinions of my aunt Nancy
Newton. which the same I got from her
in a little runnin talk the mornin she
left for home on her last visit to our
house.
'-"What is the matter with the coun
trv '" says the dear. delightful old
soul. as she put her knittin away in
that same thanky bag of hers. "Want,
want, want. 1Ne want too everlastin
much. Rufus. You have heard that old
song to the extent thlat man wants but
little here below, but you couldn't sing
that song nowadays without tellin a
pine blank lie. Man wants anything
and everythlinghe can get his hands on
and for a common thing woman aint a
blessed bit better. WVhensomcver peo
ple git to where they want more than
they are able to buy, about the next
thing you know they will be cryin out
hard times. and wecpin and wailin and
smnashin their teeth. It aint buyin
what we need. RHAfus. that keeps us dog
pore and in debt. but it is buyin what
we want. We aint willin to swim clost
to the bank and let well enough alone.
You ought to be plum happy if you
have got a good horse to ride and a com
mon hlttle spring wagin to knock about
willh and take your folks to meetin in,
but you aint. If you have got the horse
and nwagin instid of makin out with
these things till yon can see daylight
ahead on somethin better, you want a
top ,uggy, or one of these here rocka
longs, whth two seats and fancy trim
mins on the top. Andif you want these
high flyin things that generally settles
it. You are bound to have them. Conm
in right down to rock bottom and hard
pan, you don't to say exactly need
them-that is you could manage to wor
ry along soamehow without them. But
you are bound to have them simply be
cause you and your folks want them.
If you had the cash money to pay for
them it would sorter do--but money or
no money you are bound to have them.
They vill cost more on a credit than
they would if you was able to pay for
them cash down-but that is neither
aere nor there. You and your £olks
want them. and so you go right on and
buy them. Whereas you buy them like
the merchant says he sells thcm-re
gardless of cost.
"W'ell, it is about the same thing
with other people all down the line.
People want this. and they want that,
and they want the other-and that's
what is ailin of the country. Old man
VWant, and old lady WVant, and the
whole entire generation of the Want
family are holdin the bridle and run
nin the shebang. It aint no wonder- I
ment to me thBt they are rannin it

line. One person may be a little bit
worse than another, but we are all bad
enough. I have been visitin and mixin
around in the settlement so much till I
can't exactly always practice what I
preach. The air is so full of the com
mon disease till I am bound to own up
that I have caught a slight tech of it
myself. Maybe you mought not think
that a plain old eonfiscated critter like

come-would want more than she
needs, but I do. I am not in positive
need of anything exceptin a few plain
victuals and clothes to keep the body
warm and comfortable, and plenty of
smokin tobacco. But every now and
then I can catch myself wantin a new
allacca dress like the one old Miss Mil
ligan had on at meetin the Sunday be
fore. I don't in fact need it, cause my
old one is good as new. It is faded a
little here and there around in spots,
and no difference how much I switch it
I can't make it whistle like silk any
more, but outside of that there aint a
break in it, and it ought to last me two
or three years longer yet.
"But you wanted me to tell you what
is ailin of the country, and I have now
give you my opinions as best I could.
It Sint free silver and it aint 5 cent cot
fon, Rufus. And it aint because we
are a needy people. WVe aint to aay
needy, but we are too everlastin wanty
-and that is mostly what is ailin of the
country.
Andy Lucas, the natural-born horse
trader, rode by my house one day last
week to see if he couldn't work up some
sort of a swap with me. But we
couldn't trade no way we fixed it. Now
as to Andy Lucas, he loves a horse trade
better than a town hog loves slops, but
he don't generally go into a trade ex
ceptin only when he can see somethin
in it for Andy. And to be plum
square and honest, I reckon Andy
could return back the same compli
ments to me with double breasted in
terest. Anyhow, whem it come to a
horse trade between .me and Andy I
reckon one was skeered and the other
was durn glad of it, and we took it all
out in talking. But when we got back
from the paster we hunkered down out
at the horse rack for a few minits and
I got Andy's private opinions as to
what is the matter with the country.
He would fling in a little horse talk as
he went on givin out his opinions, but
I will give them to you like they come
to me-fresh from the only Andy Lucas
that ever had his day and generation in
this country.
"I have been carryin on a right
smart thinkin along the line myself
here lately, and I'll be dadburned if it
aint a mighty tough cquestion, but bein
as you have opened the pot I reckon I
mought as well stay in the game with
you. What is the matter with the
country. I don't reckon I know Rufe.
Durned if it don't look to me sometimes
like I don't know anyhing for certain.
It may be that the track is too rough,
or too heavy--it mought be that there
was some dirt and monkey work in the
start-or it mought be that we aint got
sense and judgment enough to pick the
winner. For twenty years past we
have been laying our money on cotton
and droppin our wad as reglar as pig
tracks in a peach orchard. It has been
a general favorite. ilufe, with plenty of
takers, but it has been goin lame con
stant every year, till now at last it has
went dead on its legs and off of its feet,
with all the odds agin it and but durn
few takers at 5 cents a pound. To
many people thinkin the same way at
the same time and bettin on the same
horse, till finally at last it run down be
hind the distance flag and the country
went dead broke. It will take a whole
lot of nerve to do it. Rule, but I reckon
we will have to take the old white
horse off of the track for a few heats at
any rates. and pull off the shoes and
turn him in the paster for a little restin
spell. It amy be that with light work
and plenty of rough feed he will some
time come forth ll:c a strong man to
run another race. It is a powerful
hard thing to break off and quit bettin
on a horse that has been a dead sure
winner way back in the past, but the
quittin time has come and we mought
as well quit. And with all my figura
tion 1 never have found out but the one
way to quit, and that is to take out and
turn loose and quit. WVe must trot out
a new horse and try him fora few heats
anyhow. We can't name the winner
right now, but maybe we can some of
these days in the future time to come."
"I don't sorter make out like my
mouth is a prayer book in regards as to
what is the matter with the country,"
says Blev ecroggins,when I tackled him
with the great question. It mought
be 5 cents cotton, and it inought be too
unfernal much talk about free silver
and not enough of it, but what are we
going to do about it? That is the
mainest question with me, Rule. It
aint so much what is the matter but
how are we going to help it. Mlostany
body-even to Andy Lucs. I reckon
could tell you how it has come to pass
that we got lost. as it were, in this ter
rible confusionment, but they don't tell
you what we must do to be saved.
'They can tell you all about the whys
and hows and when·eness of the smash
up, but they don't say nothin about
hlow we can git out of it with whole
hides and no bones broken. You can
find ten doctors that will give out fifty
different nr.ames for the disease, but
when a man is down fiat of hisback and
sick abed the mainest thing with him is
to git some medicine that will make
him sound and well oncst more.
"So finally at last. what are we goin
to do about it in orderncnt that we can
pull through the smashup and set the
country on her feet and let her march
on in her natural and predestined way?
I don't see no way to do it, Rufe, but to
turn around and go back to taw and
make a cross mark and spit in it, and
then come again-spile out and start
over. WVe have tried the plan of makin
more stuff in the hopes of gettin more
for it, and that don't work out right.
Now- we must want less and buy less
and spend less, and see how that will
do. I don't reckon I am any better
than the common run of my fellow cit
ixens, Rule. but my general credit and
high standin has been too good for my
own good. It has always been so I
could git most anything I wanted,
money or no ruoncy, whereas I went
and cut the cloth to, big for my breech
es. or words to that extent. It ruins
along powerful smooth and nice, Rulae.
till pay day co'res-which the same it
is bound to come somewhere down the
line-and then the devil is to pyand
no pitch hot. I will leave it you
to figger out the question as tO what
mought be the matter, but t.he onlyeat
way to bring the country around plum
safe onest more is to spit on the slate
and spile out and start over."
Now it aint for me to say who is right
and who is wrong, but at any rates it
can't do no harm to put in print a few
Sseatterin opinions that have come to

-Rev. Dr. Arbuthnot, vicar of Strat

is in much the same state as it was in
Shakespeare's time. "Of the few geon

-James Pay~s says that there was a
queer resemblance between himself
and another Trinity man. "Not only
was I often addressed by persons who
took me for him, but people used to
ask, apropos of nothing, whether I
knew So-and-So. I remember making
a considerable impression upon a
chance passenger in a railway train on
the Cambridge line, who was staring at
me rather hard, by saddenly observing:
'No, sir; I do not know Mr. So-and-So.
It had been the very question he was
going to ask me, but my anticipating
it seemed to him so canny that lie got
out at the next station."
-During the years that John Newell
was president of the Lake Shore road,
it was well understood that it was a
difficult matter to get a pass over that
line. He carried this pet idea to such
an extent that when making up his ex

of the packet addressed to President
Caldwell of the Nickel Plate these
words: "Not good on limited or fast
