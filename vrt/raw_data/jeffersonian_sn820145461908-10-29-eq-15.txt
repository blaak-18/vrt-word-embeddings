Editor Jeffersonian:
In answer to your proposition to
reorganize our Populist party after
the election, Upson county sends
greetings and will await your bid

for the war, and many of the Old
Guard of Upson have never cast any
but a straight mid-road ticket. We
believe we are going to enlist many
new recruits in the new organization.
The patience of our farmers is get
ting very threadbare—they are car
rying a heavier load than they carp
to tote, and, if we are not mistaken
in them, they are going to let their
better pid<rment overrule their preju
dices and fling themselves into the
fight with us.
If we were thoroughly organized in
all the states now, I believe we could
carry the November election, and we
may do it anyhow as Abe Lincoln
did. The claims of the Democrats
for Brvan’s elncGnn remind us of
their claims for friend Hoke Smith’s
big majority! Even up to the night
of the election, The Journal said he
would run forty thousand ahead. We
remember their claims for Alton B.
Parker, and we predicted that he
would not carry a state north of Ma
son and Dixon’s line, and he didn’t
We must carry in our principles

its vote for fifty years, having elected

and we have been sorry ever since
we elected him.
Yours truly.

MR. BRYAN AND THE SPOILS.
Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson,
associate editor of the Century
Magazine, is an able and truthful
man. He declares that he had a
conversation with Mr. Bryan last
May at the White House, during the
conference of governors, in which Mr.
Bryan expressed himself in favor of
distributing public offices among the
political parties, according to their
voting strength, thereby doing away
with the civil service system and
placing the government under the
spoils system.
Mr.-Johnson is quoted as follows
regarding this conversation with Mr.
Bryan:
Meeting Mr. Bryan at the White
House one morning last May during
the conference of governors on the
conservation of national resources, I
said to him: “Mr. Bryan, when are
yon goiner to become interested in
civil service reform? Yon know you
must come to it sooner or later, as
the merit system is the only practical
way of running the service.”
To this he responded in a voice that
Ul>e Jeffersonian
might have been heard by a dozen
persons near us:
“Why, I am interested in civil
service reform. I believe everybody
who enters the service should do so
on his merits. But I have a plan of
my own. I believe that the officers
should be divided among the parties,
in proportion to their political
strength.”
“And you would include in this
arrangement third parties also?”
“Certainly,” said Mr. Bryan, with
out flinching.
At this point our conversation was
interrupted by the opening of the ses
sion, and I did not ascertain the de
tails of Mr. Bryan’s project.
This is one of the most novel sug
gestions ever made concerning the
distribution of offices. Presumably,
if Mr. Bryan were elected, he would
abolish civil service, or so much of it
as comes within the executive power
—and that is most of it. Then he
would carefully proportion the offices
among Democrats, Republicans, So
cialists, Prohibitionists, Populists,
and other parties according to the
popular vote. Nearly one-half of the
offices under President Bryan would
be filled, therefore, by Republicans
of his choosing! A majority of the
offices would be filled by Republicans,
Populists, Prohibitionists, Socialists,
and other non-Democrats!
Would Mr. Bryan stick to his plan
in the filling of cabinet positions?
Would he have about one-half of his
advisers members of a political party
opposed to him, and interested in
defeating his policies? Certainly
not; and yet, how could he avoid
such a course if he should earnestly
try to follow his plan?
Mr. Bryan’s “plan” is hardly
calculated to appeal to the thirsty
and hungry Democratic host, unless
it is in reality a scheme to upset the
civil service and fill all the offices with
Democrats. But he cannot afford to
advocate such a scheme, for such
advocacy would alienate more votes
than it would gain. The civil service
system is firmly established, and no
party dares to abolish it.
Why, then, did Mr. Bryan make
such a suggestion? Was it because
he finds it impossible to resist the
allurement of novel, absurd, unwork
able theories? —Washington Post.

he has done one thing. He has turned
his hack on whnf nrinciples he pro
fessed in 1896 and 1900, and crossed
over, soul and body, to the enemy.
Mr. Bryan’s record is the wi-v 1 '
record—the record of a political high
wind —the record of the East wind of
Democracy, that has chilled and
bliffhfnri every prospect the party
had.—New York American.
