Reflected in the Papers of this
Great State.
Just in proportion to the indigna
tip and chagrin expressed by the
free' il~er End free trade organs over
the votes of Congressmen Broussard,
Maeyer and Davey in favor of the
Dingtey tariff bill, will those inter
ested in the prosperity and well
being.of Louisiana and her people
indorse and commend the patriotic
action. In this particular instance
thie three Democratic members of
the: lower house have rendered a
servio to their constituents which
the great body of the latter, with
out distinction of party lines, will
remember and commend long after
Senator Caffery's high-sounding
phrases about party fealty and de
votion to abstract political prin
cip.J diametrically opposed to the
public weal have faded into merited
oblivion. - Donaldsonville Chief,
Rep.
_ There can be no relief for the
pebple, there is no-panacea for low
prices in the Dingley bill. As' long
as the purchasing power of the dol
lar is increased by the laws of the
country, the agricultural products,
the products of human labor, the
price of everything else but gold,
must decrease; hence the Demo
cratic party, as the party of the
people, will stand by the Chicago
platform because its vital principles
protect the great masses of the
people, rather than trusts and mo
nopolies. It believes in a general
diffusion of wealth, rather than a
lot of aristocratic millionaires.
Shreveport Journal, Dem.
According to the comments of
some of the journals on the vote of
the Louisiana congressmen on the
Dingley bill, each must represent
local interests of his people, and
party be hanged. So it comes to
pass that Democracy in Southern
Louisiana means the Republican
high protective tariff, and in Cen
tral and North Louisiana simply "a
tariff for revenue only." In other
words, local interests must be sub
served and party principle aban
doned or looked after later. That
is a splendid method, surely, to
scatter the seeds of dissolution and
disintegrate organization ! No
party can survive the policy of sub
ordinating principle to local inter
ests. They are antagonistic and
incompatible. - Sh~reveport Times,
Dem.
We always thought that Bob
Broussard was nade out of the
"'right kind of stuft" and now we
k.tow it. He knew that the Dingley
bill would benefit the people of the
Third Congressional D)istrict, and
feeling that his duty was to the peo
ple he represented, he voted for the
bill, regardless....f ihe.'party lash.
He and Congressman Davey and
Meyer will be upheld by their con
stituents for their brave stand on a
question of such vital importance to
Southern Louisiana.-Houma Cour
ier, Dem.
A communication in answer to
the Daily States of last Sunday's
att.-ck on Congressman Broussard
for voting for the l)ingley bill will
be published in our next issue, but
in the meantime it is not amiss to
say that no true Louisianian and no
citizen of the parish of Assumption
will condemn the manly action of
'Mr. Broussard, whose patriotism
and manhood broke the shackles
which tried to tie him against the
interest of his constituents, and the
Pioneer, as a Democratic paper
from its birth, gladly congratulates
our manly young congressman in
his brave course. - Assumption
Pioneer, Dem.
There was a time in the history
of the party in this State when we
saw signs of a healthy condition of
things, and that the party could be
organized on such basis which
would draw to its support the ele
ments of the best people of Louis
iana, irrespective of class or nation
ality, but we fear that all hopes for
the accomplishment of such a result
have vanished and the bright rays
that we saw in the distance have
also been swallowed and enveloped
by the clouds of confusion, compli
cation, discord and ambition for
office and nothing more.-St. Mary
Herald, Rep.
No man can legitimately excuse
the pardon of Desforges. Only the
ukase of debilitated politics could
have secured hiis discharge from the
penitentiary. -Shreveport Progress,
Dem.
People may say what they please
about the cheap corn plan adopted
by Governor Foster and Chairman
Millsaps for the relief of the drouth
.erers, but the fact remains that
it worked well. In some instances
its purposes may have been taken
advantage of by; upscrupulous men,
but in the imaiinit has done a great
deal of good. Worthy men, men
,who could raise only a limited
amount of money, have been en
abled to sectte corn at a much
cheaper rate than they could other
wirie have done. These men are
sufferers to the exttnt that they
were starving for tood, but some of
them could not make a crop with
out the assistance'-they received,
and all of them are enabled to make
better crop with it. Those who
attack the system are not familiar
with its Workings or take a norrow
view of it. No other plan would
have relieved more people than it
has. We hope the plan can be
kept at least a few weeks longer.
Mansfield Journal, Dem.
We quite agree with the Washing
ton Post that "the Dingley bill
Democrat is a new and peculiar
breed." The breed is the queerest
f freak of political evolution-a veri
table rara avis, as it were, and
Louisiana can boast of three sl.eci
mens which are now on exhibition
I at Washington.-Daily States, Dem.
r It will strike the average candid
S person that "sugar teats" have the
- upper hand of things in the First,
Second and Third Congressional
e Districts after all; in view of the
I fact that Representatives Meyer,
Davey and Broussard all voted their
way on the tariff bill.--Shreveport
Progress, Dem.
Something to Know.
It may be worth something to
know that the very best medicine
for restoring " the tired-out nervous
system to a healthy vigor is Electric
Bitters. This medicine is purely
vegetable, acts by giving tone to
the nerve centers in the stomach,
gently stimulates the liver and kid
neys, and aids these organs in
throwing off impurities in the blood.
Electric Bitters improves the appe
tite, aids digestion, and is pro
nounced by those who have tried it
as the very best blood purifier and
nerve tonic. Try it. Sold for Soc
or Sx.oo per bottle at Wm. Clegg's

T7H/E PUBLIC SCHOOL IDEA.
St. Francisville Herald.
The public school system is one of the
grandest institutions known to our civiliza
tion. Its aim is to give to our great body of
L children an education without any financial
r incumbrances whatever. It is a wise pro
vision that the public money should be
spent for the public good, and that no child
however poor and unfortunate need be shut
t out from the privileges of securing at least a
common schoor education. The free
schools of our land constitute the basis of
universal enlightenment and the b.ck-bone
of all our republican institutions.
The public schools are also better organ
Sied and equipped for school work than
schools of a private nature can ipossibly be.
Their uniform course of study, stability and
permanency are three strong points in their
favor. Again, where there are teachers to
take charge of the various grades, better
and more thorough work can be accom
plished than by one teacher only. The
spirit of emulation that naturally arises in
r classes of large schools is also wholesome,
and many a slow mind has thus been
quickened to keener perception by coming
in contact with some of the bright lights of
the schools.
Vhile the public school idea has been
slow to gain favor in Louisiana, and we are
far behind other states in many respects,
still we have made considerable progress.
- The future is more hopeful than ever, for
there seem to be a new interest awakening
at present in pullic education. Normal
tteachers are being secured everywhere, and
a better class of pupils are entering our
school. The old conservative idea of "*bad
association" is giving place to sound com
Sno sense. The fancy and showy training
of the boarding school has been found to be
chiefly superticial. and to be wholly un
suitable for the stern duties of life. There
is no doubt whatever but that the public
schools of the State lay the best foundation
for a sound and practical education, and we
hope to see this parish especially studded
with good and comfortable school-houses
and filled with our entire school population.
That is the way to turn over a new leaf,
and let every loyal citizen bend his efforts
in that direction.
If you need any printed station
ery, we would like to furnish you
with some of it.
The Grandest Remedy.
Mr. R. B. Greeve, merchant, of
Chilhowie, Va., certifies that he
had consumption, was given up to
die, sought all medical treatment
that money could procure, tried all
cough remedies he could hear of,
but got no relief; spent many nights
sitting up in a chair; was induced
to try Dr. King's New Discovery,
and was cured by use of two bot
ties. Forr past three years has been
attending to business, and says Dr.
King's New Discovery is the grand
est remedy ever made, as it has
done so much for him and also for
others in his community. Dr.
King's New Discovery is guaranteed
for coughs, colds and consumption.
It don't fail. Trial bottles free at
WVm. Clegg's drug store.
Henry Demas will in all proba
bility be appointed naval officer at
New Orleans. Demas is a favorite
in Republican circles at Washing
ton and has been the recipient of
much attention at the hands of the
leading members of that party.
If the seams of the BUCKSKIN
BREECHES were the kind that
rip, while the buttons were poorly
fastened, and always coming off, we
wouldn't say they were good pants.
As it is, each detail is perfect.
The seams, buttons, pockets and fit
are all the best. They are the best
pants we know how to make.
