A GOOD SUGGESTION.
Beautify your home £nd premises
and thereby help to beautify your
town. Flowers, shrubbery and lawn
grasses will almost change the ap
pearance of your home. The sweet
aroma of flowers growing in the yard
never fails to attract the passerby.
Next to the wife and children there
is nothing so attractive about the
home as the flower garden full of
roses, daffodils and violets. —Line-

ACCEPTS THE TRUTH GLADLY.
Watson’s June Magazine is on our
table. We do not “lick Tom Wat
son’s boots,” nor any other man’s
“boots.” Neither do we want any
body to “lick our boots.” But when
Tom Watson tells the truth, clearly,
succinctly and forcibly; we will ac
cept it as readily as if it were told
us by our own father, were he liv
ing. Everybody ought to read the
June number of Watson’s Magazine.

GOVERNMENT EXTRAVAGANCE.
President Taft takes the sensible
view that one of the best ways to cut
down a Government deficit is to cut
down Government expenses, and his
instructions to the Navy and War De
partments to make a practical lower
ing of their estimates is a step in the
right direction. The tendency in all
of the departments of Government is
towards extravagance. Aside from
the actually necessary expenses there
is a constant increase of expendi
tures in very many ways and details
of administration, such as the multi
plying of subordinate officers, clerk
ships, etc., and the overlapping of
expenses in hundreds and thousands
of instances. The aggregate of all
the various unnecessary small ex
penditures makes a great sum. Con
gress has set a bad example in the
great increase of its own expendi
tures. There seems to be a need of
a painstaking and thorough investi
gation of all the departments with
the end in view of cutting off un
necessary officials and employees and
reducing the expenditures to the ac
tual needs of the service.—Nashville

AMERICAN PEOPLE FOOLED.
We are expecting and predicting
that when the tariff is settled that
business will boom.
If the whole cussed scheme of god
less plunder was knocked out we
would have some grounds upon
which to base a hope—not much
then.
But to expect the tariff schedule,
high or low, the passage of which is
Public Opinion Throughout the Union
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
to make cheap money, is silly non
sense.
To expect such stuff is exactly like
the saloon man’s argument that the
liquor traffic stimulates business.
“The more you spend for debauch
ery the better is legitimate busi
ness.”
For more than a half century the
tariff laws have been made and re
made, and the American people have
been fooled and re-fooled, and here
we are right up against the same old
proposition.
Some of the great dailies try to
keep the people from seeing by howl
ing “good roads”—for the farmer to
build and us city fellows to ride over
in our touring cars.
Anything to keep the folks from
investigating—keep the water mud
'o the robbers can ply their vo
cation unnoticed.
The people have been fooled a
long time and some of them are go
ing on through that way, but surely
enough will have enough sense not
to let the matter go on without limit.
If you had a machine that was
good except one broken part which
materially impaired its usefulness
and you carried that machine to a
workman of that character and he
repaired the break and the machine
did not work any better, if you did
not at once make a change in your
workman you would not go back to
him many times.
You would soon realize that that
fellow’s fixing was no good. Why
can’t we exercise as much judgment
in tariff making and currency ma
nipulation?
If we really do want a change then
we must demand of our law-makers
to make a change or step down and
out. —The Inter-State Herald.
$10,000,000 STEAL BY U. S., SAYS
SILVER CHAMPIOAN.
To the Editor Rocky Mountain News:
Much verbiage has been lavished
during the last administration (to be
continued in our next) to persuade
the voters of the United States that
a moral awakening was apparent
from conditions now existing, ini
tiated by the strenuous executive,
who appeared to contend in season
and out of season for what he called
a square deal. That this was a mere
subterfuge is easily shown. No
State in the Union has more reason
to deride this preposterous claim
than Colorado, for none is so openly
pillaged and in none are the consti
tutional rights of the people more
intolerably disregarded. For nearly
forty years legislative enactment has
robbed the miner of his hard earned
property and turned the *poil into
the treasury of the United States.
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, June 10, 1909
Cites Report of Mint.
In proof of this indisputable state
ment I ask the attention of the
miners and voters to the last report
of the director of the United States
mint, who says:
“The Government made, during
the year ending June 30, 1908, a
profit of $10,411,371.
“This represents, ■ he says, “the
difference between the price paid for
the metals and their coinage value.”
He appears to consider this trans
action an evidence of the business
acumen and sagacity of the Govern
ment. It does not seem to occur to
him that what he calls profit is, by
reason of hostile legislation, a plain
and unmitigated steal.
The laws enacted in 1873 and since
take from the industrious miner priv
ileges to which he is entitled and
which are assured to him by the Con
stitution of the United States. But
Director Lynch ought to know, and
no doubt does know, that with the
privilege of coinage restored, as it
existed before 1873, there can be no
difference between the price paid for
silver and its coinage value, for im
mediately the coinage value would
become the commercial value in every
market on earth and there could be
no profit to the Government.
Profit to Europeans.
Nor does it seem to occur to this
astute official, that every European
government, since all buy their silver
for coinage in the markets of the
United States, by reason of the dif
ference in ratio makes a larger per
centage of profit off the American
producer than his own government
makes.
The law which makes possible this
iniquitous transaction is conspicu
ously faithless, dishonorable and
mean, since the Government has ex
ercised its doubtful authority and
legislated 70 per cent, out of the
value of silver, once one of our most
valuable products, compelling its
sale at 40 cents per ounce, and then
taking shameful advantage of its mo
nopoly, and, by coining it at 16 to-A,
as it still does, then distributing it

in trade at $1.29, thereby making
what Director Lynch calls “profit”
to the United States Government of
89 cents per ounce, and to European
governments of 93 cents per ounce.
Thus the American producer, in
stead of being assisted by his own
Government, is held up and his le
gitimate profit boastfully confiscated.
The change from bimetallism to
gold monometallism cost the pro
ducers of the United States thou
sands of millions of dollars, most of
which was paid as voluntary tribute
to Great Britain, whose financiers
held the most of our bonds.
Tribute is defined by Webster, “a
periodical tax paid as an acknowl
edgment of submission.” If the Uni
ted States had been subjugated by
Great Britain, the world would have
looked on with horror and disgust if
the conquerors had exacted the
amount of tribute we have volun
tarily paid in the last forty years.
It is not due to the wisdom of our
legislators, but to the providence of
God that we are not now struggling
in the bottomless pit of bankruptcy
into which we must inevitably have
fallen but for the discovery of new
and enormously productive gold
fields in 1893 and since.

WHAT’S BRED IN THE BONE.
We find, in a letter received from
Hon. J. E. D. Shipp, the following
passage:
“A few days ago 1 saw advertised
in New York a letter written in 1776
about one Thomas Watson, of Penn
sylvania, who persisted in adhering
to his Quaker doctrines and preach
ing discontent, etc. This old man
appeared to be a genuine kicker of
the first water. How like our own
Watson, who must be a descendant
in the direct line and inherited these
qualities. Selah.”
So it would seem that we get the
name and the pacific propensities by
honest inheritance.
