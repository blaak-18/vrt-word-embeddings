Franklin Sun : We canfl only speak s
generally upon the subject ; nor do P
we deettim it tncelsary to point out,
specially the dlelets in the Conistit u
lioni iof lrti. We ate perfectly \lull
satisiled that ione counhl be fratuile
that t ouitil nicth better leet tll e to
lirelents of the timnies. A pure
streami canniot ie cxnected to flow fromn
a muddy sotrcee. We believe that a
Convention, compoiIlsed of pure, pa
triotic, enliightentied and intelligent
citizens, could he assebinbled i our
State ; mien twho have felt andil de
plored the evil eficeots of bad govern
ment and iuntjust and oppressive laws;
tien who wotildI be actuated by pture
aind prilper moti\ves, tlnd w iould exert
their best energies to flnate a tutl

righlits and privileges to all, and bringli

We therefore favor a Constitutional
Conyvention.
New Orleans Delta Among the
reasons given for a Louisiana State
Convention, to readjust and ameid
the Constitution, is the iporiltant
one that the present judiciary sys
tem is much too expensive and cunm
brous. iThe Judicial Districts, it is
claimed, are too liunierous. Under
the old system, the iarishesof Ouach
ita, Moirehouse, Caldwell, Cutahtoula,
Franklin and the laruger part of Rich
land, composed the Twelfth Judicial
l)istritt. The Judge's salary was
$3,000;1 that of the District Attorney,
$600--mnking a total of .$3,6100.
These jiarishes nowc form two dis
ricnts, with the fofllowing scale of ex
penditure : Two Disti icts Judges,
10,000; two Districts Attorneys $4,
I)0, antd six Panish Judges, about S9,
0n - - making a total ouf $23,000.
Whilst a reduction of the paurish
courts is not asked for, it is argued
that fewer Districts Courts would not
onlyi be inore economical but would
uitnply answer all the demands of law
and justice.
ilaToo manllty legislators, and two
much law-tinking and law-mitaking,
have been among the most grievous
of the plagnes of Egyplt that ihave af
licted Ltouisiana since the lohst of
the wcar. A constitutionai conven
tion would give a fir oplportlinity
for a thorough revision of this mass
.if crude, ill.digestld matter, nmost of
it thte compound of corruption and
ignorance. ThIten, with a restricted
number of legislators, biennial ses
sion of the Legislature, abolition of
aill official fees, and a clause compIel
tiog every voter to show his poll-kax
and other tax receipts, ere deposiitig
his ballot in the ballot-box, wo.anighlt
hope for more efficie ant and ecolilnoi

For the principles by which The World
a will be governed in its discussion and
50 treatment of the public questions, it will
ad suffice to say that The World, while con
servative in politics, desires the consevra
tion only of what is good andi wise in oar
public institions and no limitations napn
the right of pIivate judgment andthe
aspirations of Reform, save those which
are imposed by prudence. decorum, and
- a rational respect for vested righti and
for the honest opinions of all classes and
a sects of men. While it has labored for
the principles and hails the triumph of
tihe Democratic party as affording n~l
practical proumise of Reform in our public
:nlmihnistrations, city, state and national)
it will not be blindly devoted to the ad
Ivancement of any party or any clique.
It will freely canvass the pablie conduct,
while it will treat with respect the pri
en vate rights, of Public Men, and it will e
amine fearlessy into the workings of outr
R national, stato and municipal govern
mients.
-d It will inculeate a steadfast relianed
ins p1on the original priunciples of our poli
od tical systeln as the only sound basis of all
id neieded illmlorvemlcut thereiu ; an unfalt
n cring devotion to tile Constitution and
is the Union, a scrupulous fidelity tothe
'e spi rit as well as the letter of our laws,
el- and a sleepless vigilance in maintaiinfg
all the great safegurads of Civil and
ra- Religious Liberty. It will seek to mit
ral igate and not to aggravate the evils in
son separable from Party Government ino
Il Free Country; to promote good and not
w ill feeling among our fellow-citzens of all
Screeds and colors, all sections and~l
sects; and to advanlce bothby its pre
to ecepts and by its exaLoplo the reign of
Reason and of Law over prejudice an'
passion in all our public action and ii
the discussion of all public affihirs.
It will do justice always, to the bestl
its ability to all men and to all claseeso
men ; it will recognize no enemies but 1th
enemies of good morals, pubiic order an.
the law ; it will endeavor, in a word, tI
make its columns a terror to ev\il-doen
Sand a praise to them that do well.
Nor will it lose sight meanwhilq of the
ber great and legitimlate demand of the
we reading public for entertainntent. The
