Jan. 28, 1895.
FA. PorPLcsr:
Our Brother Goodwyn of the
Colfax Chronicle has referred us
to an editorial comment which he
reproduced from the Daily Picay
une as being "a complete answer
and overthrow of our theory that
the government can issue cheap
money and sustain it at per value,
with nothing but the faith of the
Sgovernment to back it." We had
already read the article referred to
and we have also seen many other
productions of the Picayune and
also the Times Democrat both
leading democratic journals and
we suppose good authority from a
democratic standpoint. We will
give a few samples of what we have
seen in these two papers. We saw
and read that a "silver standard of
money would put cotton to 10 and
11 cents per pound and wheat to
one dollar per bushel." We saw
and read that Havermeyer presi
dent of the "sugar trust" paid
either the democratic or republi
can party for whatever legislation
he wanted in favor of the trust.
We have seen and read in these
papers (upon the question of over
production) that production had
increased only 13 per cent while
consumption had deereased 25 per
cent in 1894. We have seen and
read in these papers that Robbery,
Burglary, Larceny, Suicide and
Insanity had increased in the Un
ited States 27 per cent in the year
1894. We saw and read in the T.
D. that the People's party had
made miraculous gains in every
state in the Union at the last elec
tion. We have seen and read in
the same paper that the administra
tion had spent all the revenues of
the government besides creating an
indebtedness of one hundred mil
lions of dollars with five per cent
interest that the people will have
to pay in gold in addition to which
the government would have to is
sue four hundred million dollars
more in bonds and yet none of the
debts of the government would be
paid. We have seen and read (re.
cently) in these papers that there
are 60,000 people on the verge of
starvation in the state of Ohio
caused by being out of employ
ment. We have seenand read in
these papers where bar rooms,
bath houses, barber shops and
restaurants were run for the lux
ury at the members ot eongress
sad at a cost of thousand of dollars
to the already overburdened and
overtaxed people. We have seen
in them papers that tbexpeses of
the government have in the last
few yar inereased from GB 50 per
eapita to 7 75 per espita. We
are sateed that our friend (Good
wya) s seem d read the same
t tmgs bt he ingemlomly maoede
osh frts from the people. Why
does do sol Is such a course
ia jourmim hamtS It is but
e that the people absou know

way that the people e vot lats l

congress can make money of gold,
silver, paper or other material and
declare it to be a legal tender but
that does.not compell anybody to
accept it in the way of bnsiness.
Any legal tender money may be
tendered in payment of claims but
that is theextent of the legal ten
der power." There is no question
better.settled than that when a le
gal tender money is offered in pay
ment of a debt the creditor is
bound to take it and should he re
fuse to do so be wll get absolutely
nothing, this is a principle of law
about which there is no cavil or
doubt. Then if the government
can make a legal tender money out
of paper or other material (as the
Pic admits) then there is no ques
tion as to the duty of the govern
ment to make this money in a
sufficient amount to transact the
business of the country. The Un
ited States government is the only
power under the sun that can make
a legal tender money for its people
as the states in the formation of the
government transfered and'sarren
dered all such rights to the gener
al government. If we take the en
tire article of the Pic it conclusive
ly shows that the great financial is
sue that now confronts us is one
not of the quality of money but of
the quantity. The editor of the
Picrefers to a time after the war
when greenbacks sold at the rate
of $2 80 in greenbacks for one dol
lar in gold and says, "this ought to
dispel the false notion that the
stamp on money is what gives it
the value." This certainly expos
es the desire of the Pic's editor to
deceive the people or his ignorance
of the financial history of his coun
try. It Is a historical fact that
the first $60,000,0) of greenbacks
issued have never been, below par
with gold but often at a premium
over gold. Why was this Be
cause they were made full legal
tender "for all debts public and
private." The next bill that wa
introduced for another issue of
greenbacks passed the Houne con
taintng the same legal tender feat
ures of the former oill and before
it passed the senate the bankers
called a convention which met in
Washington and by their influence
caused an "ex-caption clause" to
be inserted in the bill by which the
greenbacks issued there under was
made "legal tender for all debts
uemept intermt on a, gme debt and
impost dsties." Why was this done
you ask I Simply because the
balkers held all the gold sad all
the dbts againnt the government
(jOust as now) hence their ight
against the full legal tender green
back there just asthey are maling
the fight against all other money
except gold and bank notes now.
This is the infamous scheme that is
now sinking the people nlato the
deepest dregs of poverty and will
continue to sink them dreeper if
Sthey do not rise in their might sad
putitdown. Itmust and will be
done. Well, I hope I have not
been too lengthy and with three
haurrah for the grand old d ag of
li herty I am a well wisher.

ample Young men who desire to
succeed in life fully recognize that
in order to do so, they most han
dle liquor very gingerly. If they
are inclined to it anyhow, they'll
get it, prchibition or not.
However, it is not alone the in
ebriate who becomes the victim of
the mistaken zeal of the probibi
tionist; the honest, sober and in
dustrious citizen who does not con
sider it a felony to buy a drink at a
convenient place, (though made so
by statutory enactment) and who
has been accustomed to his toddy
for these many years without get
ting intoxicated, will resort to the
same practices and subterfhges,
because be rightfully feels that be
has been deprived of (to him) an
innocent indulgence in order to
gratify the whims of visionary
zealots. Then naturally follow the
"blind tigers" and bad liquors with
their attendant trains of spys, in
formers and other creatures of that
ilk, alike objectionable to good
men and bad.
But has the Enterprise, or any
other local prohibitionist, ever
looked into the question to the ex
tent of examining into the results
of the law where it has been tried
or is now in force? After a con
aslentions trial in Delaware, Mas
schasetts, Rhode Island, Connec
ticut, Indiana, Nebraska, New
York, Illinois and Ohio prohibition
was discarded in disgust. It is
now the law in Maine, New Eiamp
shire, Vermont, lowa, Kansas and
the two Dakotas. Of these, the
Legislature of Iowa, some months
ago, and of South Dakota, last
week, psuedl the necessary amend
ments looking to the repeal of that
article of their constitution which
Axes prohibition in their organic
law. We are told that the ameid
meant' will be carried by handsome
majorities when submitted to the
people in due course.
If prohibition really prohibits
anything, except the collec
tiou of a legitimate revenue
from the sale of hquors, why

Statest Their verdict is that it
does not, and that its application
is a delusion sad a snare. Again,
the New York Herald recently sent
a representative through the State
of Maine with Instruetions to make
a faithfkl and impartial report on
its operation there. His observe
tions have recently been published
to the discredit of the State and
the discomfiture of the prohibition
cause. lie asserts that the law is
Shamelessly and often opealy vio
lated by odfeer of the law, as well
as by Ipivate citizena; that "blind
tigers" abound, and tihat the liquor

Sinevitable result of such legisla
tihe. Instances of its failure
might be multiplied ad h i , but
it seems that this ought toamsee
to show the! atter inadequacy of
seh s law to deal with the evil.

Arriving in Natchitoehes to at
tend - Agricultural Convention,
and looking around for the place,
as I arrived in front of the door of
the Comas Club I was under the
impression, fkom the strains of mu
sic, that I was on Canal street in
New Orleans. I felt down in my
pocket for the proceeds of 2 pounds
and a-half of Old King Cotton, but
was informed that it was a free ex
hfbltion given us by Murphy J,
and on reaching the top of tho
stairs my eyes fell on Murphy J's.
gyacutus, old John Dymond, one
of the leaders ti the sugar bonnty
steal. I made inquiry fo' Murphy
J., and was told he was in Wash.
ington attending to the bounty
steal, while he had old John in
North Louisiana throwing tobacco
in the eyes of old hayseed.
After further scanning Murphy's
muaeum of political anatomy, then
I could see the Clanelnatus of the
19th century, having left the plow
handles, ready to put their sub
sellers into the poekets of old hay
seed, and with one sweep leave
him in a well harrowed condltion.

his products is farmers in the leg
