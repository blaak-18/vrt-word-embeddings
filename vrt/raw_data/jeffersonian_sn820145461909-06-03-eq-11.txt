The Political Transformation
of Turkey
(Concluded from Page 3)
afterward attempt to use the army
for their purposes.
When all the adherents of the
“Young Turk’’ party had returned
from abroad free from fear, when
the press had been liberated, a great
wave of enthusiasm swept over the
entire country. This, too, <was en
tirely unexpected to us. We had
thought the Turkish people to be pos
sessed of no sense of political values.
Now we beheld them rejoicing in
common over the new era. There
was ardent fraternization among the
various classes, committees of peace
were established between the various
nationalities; Turks and Arabs,
Serbs and Bulgarians met upon a
common ground, and national unity
and brotherhood were everywhere
proclaimed. Such a fever of enthu
siasm may arouse a feeling sufficient
ly strong to sustain substantial in
stitutions of national unity. But
when we remember the background
of mutual distrust and warfare, we
can realize that it may not be lasting
enough to sweep away historic facts.
That which has been sown must have
its harvest. In Turkey we have in
the first place the Turkish race,
which as the ruling race is more or
less disliked by all other subject peo
ples. The Turks are intelligent and
have certain moral virtues; they had,
however, allowed themselves to get
into political conditions which we
have discussed. To the Turks are
especially opposed the Arabs. The
Arabs have been trying for a genera
tion to break away from Turkish do
minion. They are a very warlike
race. In Asia there are, besides, the
Kurds, Armenians and Syrians, all
subject to constant warfare and law
lessness. The feud between the
Kurds and the Armenians has long
been sustained both through racial
animosity and religious antagonism.
Only last week hundreds and thou
sands of Armenians were killed.
There are also many differing ele
ments on the European side. Each
seeks the supremacy of its own race.
The Bulgarians want a greater Bul
garia built on the ruins of the Turk
ish Empire, and the Servians want
the same thing for themselves. How
out of all this there can arise a uni
fied feeling, is a mystery, almost im
possible to solve. Yet we have seen
the beginning of such a union and in
the end it may be built strong enough
to uphold a unified nationality.
Turning to the events of the last
few days, we note that after the
revolution of July, political parties
were speedily formed. There is one
called the Islamic party, which was
composed of the reactionary ele
ments, especially deposed office-hold
ers who wish to appeal to religion in
order to overthrow the new and re
establish the old regime. On the oth
ere hand, the Liberal party which is
in favor of local autonomy for the
various racial elements in Turkey
supports the new regime and has as
a political ideal a federal state. Be
tween the two there is the Young
Turkish party of Union and Progress,
demanding national unity, parliamen
tary government and a strong central
administration.
In February it was claimed that
there was a movement on foot to de
pose the Sultan. As a result, the
cabinet was changed. Kamil Pasha,
the Liberal prime minister, resigned.
The cabinet which then came in last
ed for a short time only, because on
April 13a new revolution broke out.
This also was a revolution of the
army, but unlike its predecessor, it
was a revolution of the rank and file
rather than of the officers. It was
plainly evident that the soldiers in
Constantinople had been heavily
bribed. Even the chausseurs, who
were the chief reliance of the “Young
Turks,’’ were involved in this move
ment. The battle crop was “The Sa
cred Law (the cheriat) and the en
forcement of the power of the Sul
tan.” It was therefore nominally a
religious movement, though prac
tically an attempt to regain power
3effersonian
for the reactionaries. The Sultan
readily promised that he would “do
the will of his children.”
It did not take long for the organ
ization of the Young Turks, the Com
mittee of Union and Progress, to
make itself felt. It soon rallied its
forces and its soldiers marched on
Constantinople. The committee had
control of the artillery, which became
as decisive an element as it was in
the first stage of the career of Napo
leon. This military movement was
speedily successful. The revolting
troops were subdued after several
thousand were killed. Because of
his political crimes the Sultan was
deposed and his brother Reshad, af
ter his twenty-five years in prison,
was made constitutional ruler. Tur
key is again a constitutional country
and her parliament has returned to
the discussion of the difficult nation
al problems which confronts the new
regime. The civilized world looks on
with approval and hopes that the
statesmen of the new order may be
successful in their difficult task. —La-

THOMAS WATSON’S JEFFERSON
IAN MAGAZINE.
There is no publication in Ameri
ca that I find more interesting than
Tom Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine.
I do not agree in all things with
Mr. Watson.
But I regard him as the most bril
liant magazine writer in America.
In the greater number of instances
he is right—more often right than
he is wrong.
This magazine only costs one dol
lar a year and ought to be in the
home of every Southern man.—The
Issue.
OUR POST-CARD CLUB.
The strike on the Georgia Rail
road, which stopped the running of
all trains, separated Daddy Jim from
his mail for nearly two weeks. All
the mail —both male and female
mail—of The Jeffersonian Post-Card
Club and the Junior Jeffs, will be
handled right away, and the prize
winner in the boys’ and girls’ con
test will be announced in next week’s
paper. If all you children who are
disappointed at this delay will re
member the disappointment and its
cause when you grow up to be rail
road presidents, or the wives of rail
road presidents, it may help you to
be more considerate of the rights of
others.
“What are you going to be when
you are a man, Tommy?” “I am
going to be an aeronaut, like Mr.
Wright.” “Why do you choose that
profession, my boy?” “Because it is
the quickest way to get up in the
world.”—Baltimore American.
Miss Screecher —I wonder if Uncle
Jim remembered me when he made
his will? I used to sing for him.
Lawyer—Yes, he evidently remem
bered you—at least your name isn’t
mentioned in the document. —Chica-
go Daily News.
“Fellow-citizens,” shouted the can
didate, “if I am elected for this dis
trict, I shall endeavor to make you
glad that you did not elect another.”
“That’s right!” yelled the dry goods
box philosopher, “I reckon one
would be a-plenty!”—Puck.
Justifiable!
Two neighbors in a Missouri vil
lage were arrested for fighting and
brought to court. The judge asked
the assailant to tell his story.
“Judge,” he said, “we war a-play
in’ of seven up, seven pints t’ th’
game, two-bits on the corner. I had
been loosin’ all day, jedge, an’ I had
up my last two bits.
“I dole kyards. He was two an’ I
was six. He begged an’ I give him
one. He slang his queen an’ I played
my tray for low. He slang his king,
an’ I played my ten. He slang his
ace an’ I played my Jack, an’ then,
jedge, he slang his deuce, an’ I hit
him.” —Saturday Evening Post.
