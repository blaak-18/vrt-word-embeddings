Do we want another Preston Brooks affair?
Do we want another “ bloody shirt” for North
ern fanatics to wave?
'Do we want to make out of Foraker what the
<cane of Brooks made out of Sumner?
No matter how provoking Foraker may become,
see to it that no angry Captain McDonald, or a<ny
other infuriated Southerner, harms a hair of For
aker’s head.
No matter how bitter his language—take it, for
the South’s sake.
Make speeches of reply in which you maintain
a composure, under trying circumstances, which
will win the respect of the world.
Make as many appeals to Public Opinion as you
like, but base them upon fact and argument.

THE ATLANTA RIOT.
The committee appointed by a
mass meeting of the citizens of At
lanta to report on the riot that dis
graced that city some weeks ago, has
made its report.
The committee reports that twelve
people were killed and seven were
wounded. Among those killed ten
were negroes and two were white.
Os the wounded ten were white and
sixty were negroes. The report
shows that not a single person killed
or injured was a vagrant, but that
each was at work and earning a good
living.
The committee reports that good
citizens have been driven from At
lanta because of the riot. From one
small settlement in Atlanta twenty
live families have moved away.
The report concludes as follows:
4 i The crimes of the mob include
robbery as well as murder. In a
number of cases the property of in
nocent and unoffending people was
taken. Furniture was destroyed,
small shops were looted, windows
were smashed, trunks were burst
open, money was taken from thq
small hoard, and articles of value
were appropriated. In the commis
sion of these crimes the victims, both
men and women, were treated with
unspeakable brutality.
“As the result of four days of
lawlessness, there are in this glad
Christmas time widows of both races
mourning for their husbands and
husbands of both races mourning for
their wives; there are orphan chil
dren of both races who cry out in
vain for faces they will see no more;
there are grown men of both races
disabled for life, and all this sorrow
has come to people who are abso
lutely innocent of any wrong doing.
“In conclusion, wo call attention
to the fact that up to this time At
lanta had been a law-abiding city and
criminals of all kinds, with a single
exception, had been punished by legal
methods. Repeatedly, in view of
hundreds of men, the sheriff has con
ducted along the public highways,
prisoners chaiged with the most
odious crimes, and these prisoners
have had legal trials, which resulted
in the punishment of the guilty and
the acquittal of the innocent.
“Considering this record of a law
abiding community it is amazing that
the things we have recited could have
happened in Atlanta and that the
small minority which constitutes the
Avoid abuse as you would poison.
Remember the remark which Blaine made to L.
Q. C. Lamar.
After Conkling had worsted Gen. John B. Gor
don in a Senatorial tilt, Lamar felt so badly over
it that he took occasion, a few days later, to give
Conkling such an awful trouncing as few United
Stales Senators have ever taken.
Conkling took it all right for, although a man
of courage, he knew the deadly temper of Lamar
when aroused.
Conkling had said, alluding to preceding words
of Lamar, “It would seem that the Senator from
Mississippi meant to be insulting.”
With an eye of fire and the roar of the enraged
lion in his voice, Lamar made that celebrated re-
tough element was allowed to crucify
this community in the eyes of the
world, and shock the moral sense of
our own people.”
It is always the ease that a riot
does more harm than goqd. It has
rarely happened that a lynching ac
complishes the purpose that it in
tended. Beyond saving the victim
from having to go to the court house
and testify to her shame, a lynching
is void of good effect. A lynching
creates discord rather than allays
trouble. This was emphasized by the
report of the Atlanta committee. It
says:
“Although less than three months
have passed since the riot, events
have already demonstrated that the
slaughter of the innocent does not
deter the criminal class from com
mitting more crime. Rape and rob
bery have been committed in the city
and suburbs during that time.”
It is not probable that Atlanta
will have another riot soon. The
people of that city will not stand
for more trouble with the races. The
business men of Atlanta are thor
oughly aroused, and if another riot
should start, the bankers, the mer
chants, the lawyers, the doctors and
the clergymen would shoulder arms
and take a part in the fray. And
woe be to those who start a row if
the conservative people of a commu
nity see fit to attempt to put it
down. The most dangerous man on
earth is a conservative man when he
is arousal.
The Atlanta riot has done the state
of Georgia and the South a great
wrong. It will take years to liv>
down the odium of it. We hope that
the fair name of the South will never
be disgraced by another such as it
was.—Dublin, Ga., Courier-Dispatch.
THE DIFFERENCE.
A couple of days ago the Leader
commented on the difference in the
treatment by officers of the law of
the big thief and the little thief.
This favoritism led to a sensational
incident in a Chicago court on Tues
day.
A former vice-president of the
board of trade was tried on a charge
involving defalcations to the amount
of $750,000. Notwithstanding that
he was one of the “best” citizens
of Chicago, that he moved in the
“highest society” and that his wife
spent $38,000 a year in maintaining
VHE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
their “social position,” a jury found
him guilty.
As is usual a bailiff stepped for
ward to take him into custody. He
was ordered back by the judge, who
showed some solicitude for the feel
angs of the convict and who wanted
to spare him from the indignity of
being taken into custody by a com
mon bailiff. At this the state’s
attorney stepped up to the bar and
said:
“If Mcßeynolds had stolen a ham
the bailiff would have grabbed him
by the neck and carried him off to
jail. Having figured in a big crime
the man is treated as though he had
done something for his country. I
think this is one of the serious de
fects of our laws.”
But it is not due to any defect
in our laws. It is due to the money
worshippers whom we elect and ap
point to office. They will not. admin
ister the law without favoritism.
Money always gets the best of it.
There is no law needed to cure
this. That may be accomplished by
the people driving the money-wor
shippers out of their temples of jus
tice as the money-changers of old
were driven out.—'Pittsburg Leader.

As To Dryden.
Is New Jersey wholly servile? Is
there no manliness in its citizens?
Is its press seduced by the revenue
from Mr. Dryden’s Prudential ad
vertisements? A little vigilance,
prompt pressure at the right time—
these can make out of the pres
ent New Jersey Legislature a
body of record-breaking usefulness.
For a generation it has been the easy
yielding handmaiden to Mr. Dry
den’s purposes. It passed the law
that enabled him to rob the policy
holders of tiheir surplus. Twelve
years later it passed a law to legalize
that robbery. When other States,
protecting their own poor, condemn
ed Mr. Dryden’s practices and threat
ened to exile his company then the
ever-willing New Jersey Legislature
gave Mr. Dryden a retaliatory club
with which to intimidate them. It
passed a law of which the effect was
thus described by the insurance
commissioner of Massachusetts: If
Ma.ssac.hu cetts should refuse a li
cense to the Prudential, New Jersey
could refuse to every insurance com
pany whose home is in Massachusetts
the right to do business in Now Jer
sey. Never was the dignity of a com-
bo!: “Yes. Mr. President, 11i
Senator from New York has <
Io he insulting. They are such
man would deserve, and no
wear. ’ * '
Did the taunt hurt Conkling in the North?
Not the least bit.
■So well did Northern Senators understand that
such attacks from Southern men would strengthen
them in the North, that Blaine came over to his
friend Lamar and said to him with playful badi
nage: “Look here. Quint, the next time you have
abuse of that sort to give to a Northern Senator,
give it ito me.”
Will Southern members take the hint and not a
give Foraker the martyrdom lie courts? "
