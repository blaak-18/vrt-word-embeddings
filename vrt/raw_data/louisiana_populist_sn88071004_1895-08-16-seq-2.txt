That vote of the indorsement of
Cleveland's administration which

in their State convention was not
quite 16 to 1, but it was 647 to 238.
There will be no split among
the politicians of the two old par

the most competent men to sup

Blanlcard'n a chee Explained.
The wily politicians, who woull
perpetuate themselves in office for
life. are indulging in the labored
- cry of "Populist and Republican
iT.r unification to defeat the I)iemocrat
ic party." As a Democrat, the
Caucasian will not be misled by
o.' this twaddle, and asserts that the
ecr. Populists in Louisiana, as a body,
are as strongly opposed to Repub
'0lican ascendancy and dominancy as
are the loud-mouthed men whose
plaint is familiar to the people.
The Caucasian is no apologist of
the Populists, but would not forget
- the service they rendered the State,
0 n when, as Democrats, they contrib
uted their power and their influ
s ence to the emancipation of Lou
00 isiana from the rule of Ignorance
u and venality.
It is the C'aucasian's opinion that
in- the spread of Populism is due to
per the intolerance of so-called leaders
of Democracy, for whose advance
ment principles of party have been
pr perverted to individual interests.
Is it a wonder that life-long
)Democrats are filled with distrust
b when men like Gorman, Brice and
othcrs dominate the majority by
n their peculiar methods
At the recent Democratic prima
U ry held in Baltimare, Md., only
$,000 of 55,000 votes were cast for
the delegates which were listed for
the Democratic convention mani
pulated by Gorman.
The majority of the Democrats t
in Baltimore and in Maryland de
clined to participate in the prima
ry because they realized that Gor
.man and his strikers had the ma- I
t- chinery to silence the opposition. (
nt It is Gormanism-Briceism which 1
n- has strengthed the Populists and I
lie brought Democracy into contempt. c
-Shreveport Daily Caucasian. e
of It is refreshing to find among
ch the truckling, sniveling, subsidiz
ve ed press, a paper like the above,
of with manhood enough to stand for
8. truth and principle.
The Daily Picayune of Saturday,
r- the 10thinst., contains a column in- ti
s- terview with Hero, Leonard, and
e other Republicans who stand ready n
to assist such goldbug papers as e
the Picayune, and such goldlug a
leaders as Mr. Blanchard, in blow- p
p- ing life into the dead carcass of ne- si
gro domination.
ly If Mr. Blanchard and his great
allies, the Picayune and the Repub- n
licans can build up this scare-crow, i
r which originated entirely in their
11 imagination, they think they can
use it to drive the poor devilish
party slaves to support the Demo- o
t, cratic party, regardless of the
a goldbug platform, and candidate e
k (Foster) they intend to put on it.
I. We want to thank the Caucasian ti
. for its manly repudiation of this M
a false charge, and placing the blame tt
a where it properly belongs-on the o
y Republicans who have crept into m
1 the Democratic party. la
We also want to recommend the th
Caucasian to the seekers after a
f truth, as the "Free Lace" of Cad
!do. ya

Chairman A. B. Booth called the
r State Central Committee of the
red People's party to order at 8 o'clock
can p. m., with Secretary Ii. L. Brian
rat- at the desk. A roll call showed 31
the parishes represented, and a quo
the rum present.
On motion, R. W. George, of
uh- Caddo, was appointed Sergeant-a'

use Reports from the various par
of ishes as to the growth of Populism
get was called for and given, and s:nme
te, was very gratifying.
ib On motion of W. J. O'Neal, the
u- chairman was authorized to ap
oce point a Campaign Executive Com
mittee of 6 imemlbers, to include
hat himself as ex-officio chairman : said
to committee to take charge of the
campaign and report to the next
en meeting of this bodly. The com
mittee was appointed as follows :

SE. C. I)illon; 5th, J. W. McFar
land, and Hon. A. Benoit; c;th, J. I
ia- T. Howell.
ily On motion, adjourned to 10
o'clock a. m. Wednesday. r
nW- ednesday, 10 o'clock a. in.
Committee called to order by '
its Chairman Booth, and roll call
le- showed 35 members present. o
's An address to be issued to the d
ia- people of the State, was read by
chairman Booth. After discussion
ch by J. T. Howell and others, on B
nd motion, it was referred to a special n
t. committee of five which the chair
appointed, as followe: T. J. Grice,
J. W. McFarland, J. T. Howell, C
g J. A. Tetts and Maj. M. R. Wil- n
son.
e, The committee on address re
or ported the following :
Whereas. It is notoriously true that e
elections in Louisiana are but a farce,
Y, so far as obtaining any expression of h
n- the will of the people because of the
d fact that ballot box stuffing, false count- ii
ing and fraudulent returns are the
ly means used by the faction now in pow
er, calling themselves Democrats :
And whereas, this condition of damn- s
ag able corruption is the stock in trade of
the most corrupt of the politicians and
place hunters, who use the cry of white
e- supremacy and negro domination to W
scare and coerce our people into sub
mission;
at And whereas, it is notoriously true 8e
that the greatest strength of the cor
brptionists of the faction now in power at
in this State, is in what is known as the
Black Belt, where they have so ontrag
ir ed suffrage as to count negro votes
Un which were never cast nor ever existed
-notably in the case of the late Con
gressional election in the Fifth District fo
.- of this State, in which in the parish of
Madison where there is a registered
e vote of 1,068. a vote of 5i was return
to ed for Benoit, (Pop). against a vote of
over 1,900 returned for Boitner, (Dem).. lo
showing a clear manufacture of a ficti
on tious vote of over 800, further, so high
an authority as State Senator G. W. o
Montgomery and others state on oath bx
1e that the rule in the black parishes is to
count the negro-not to vote him-thus wi
l over-ruling and defeating large white D
:o majorities in other parishes,
And whereas, it is degrading to the
last degree for our people to submit to al
e this condition of affairs-a condition fr
which none but the craven and the cow
rard can tolerate.
. Therefore, we call upon the good 10
people of Louisiana to proceed at once fa
in forming such a compact organization stj
as will prevent such outrages of their
- rights of suffrage. for which no excuse
o can be offered. Anexercise of the man- he
hood necessary to protect the sacred
rights of suffrage. lil
e call upon the people to actively i
- and ,ealously coutinue their work of
Sorganization and enrollment with the
firm determination to turn out on the afi
day of the next election all over the
State, andgo to the polls prepared to th
stay during the voting and the counting,
and with the open aind avowed purpose ref
of establishing the right of the people
to hold a peaceful, fair, free and honeet a
election ; to obtain an expression of the
Swill of the majority-a work in whbich
- no citizen is too rich or too poor to en
of. and to stand side by side in de- ce
We do not believe our people are
such cowards, even in the submission
which they are now under, as to per-t
I imt themselves to be frtherdeaded
by the domination of the tools, thugs his
and desperadoes, employed by those
Iwho ear only to possess t tfeelves f
thl spoils of oloe and care nmrht f1r
t o tre of the people, sad afie w el

And Mially, we call upon the people g
in every ward in the State to proceed
with tshe enrollment of all men, who
have the or and the patriotism to
I defend their aihts and secure that pro- pi

The State Bimetallei League.
d? Referring to the meeting in New
ho Orleans on Saturday last of the
Slt State Central Committee of the
[Louisiaua League, the Times-Dem
. ocrat say, :
Jn- The meetling was well attended
to by delegtes fronm tlhe country lpar
. ishes, andl thec(Ominitte: was swell
ed to twice the size at its last meet
er ing in June, when it )organized.
Lii- The conference itas for the pir
)pose( of organizing with the view
, of making an1 earnest and1 vi-oroui
at ciaml)pain, :ndl to talk over the
sl situation and d:( ide upon a line of
policy. There was a long and in
Steresting delbate on the latter point
and many suggestions mtade, amUoing
others, the holding of a white p1ri
minry on October 17 to (letermine
he, the views of the white vo\ters of
be the state on the qluestion o)f the
d free eoinane o(f silver.
The conilnittee held over, with
I out prejudice, this andl a numbler
of other proj)ositions madle, to take
them up and consider them later.
It decidedo, however, to begin at
(once an earnest campaign in favor
c- of silver, and to arouse and organ
ize the people of LouiiiaMna.
S To that end a caumpaign commit
tee of seven was aplx)inted to car
d ry on the campaign, to secure able
and eloquent speakers who will
it expound to the voters of the State
the benefits that will accrue fromn
the remonetization of silver and to
distribute literature to the same
.' end.
pWe imagine, however, that the
people of the State are already
well informed on the subject of
silver ; that a large majority of
them are already in favor of free
coinage, and that it will not require
able speaking or more paper to
convert them. The main point is
to organize the friends of silver so I
that they will be able to have their
wishes carrled out, and not he
tricked as the silver men of Ken
tucky recently were. This is what I
the campaign committee should
proceed to do, so that when the
e time comes, the voice and senti- p
ment of Louisiana will be thrown
a to silver and there will he no way
of changing or clouding the issue.
