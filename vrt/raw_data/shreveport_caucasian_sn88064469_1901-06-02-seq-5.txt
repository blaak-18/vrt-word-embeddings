ty as a private house with a flower and
shade tree lawn about it. It has at
tended to the beautifying of public
parks and walks, to the c!eauing ann
paving of the streets and the drainage
and general sanitation of the whole
place. Wherever In the vicinity there
was natural scenery of an attractive
character those women bad it preserved
and cared for. They divided themselves
into committees, each one taking a par
ticular work to itself and attending to
that. The farms about the v'llage have
caught the Iwpetus and are cutting
away the weeds from their fence lines
and removing the pigstles from their
front door vistas. The earth is becom
ing a thing of beauty for miles around
where these blessed women live. They
have created a public sentiment for bet
ter things.
There is a women's improvement
club in the far south, at Lake Charles,
near New Orleans. Here 18 ladies took
on themselves the, task of redeeming
the rural aspects. They planted splen
did live oak trees along driveways;
they placed flowering shrubs along
park walks. Attached to their village,
as there is to most country places, was
an abandoned cemetery, with its rank
weeds, sunken graves and broken
tombstones, a dank, nightmare spot,
suggestive of suicide and ghost riding.
The women had a hard task with that
-one which tried all their powers
but they reconstructed the frightful old
place, and they see that It is kept in
arder.
They turned their attention to the
schoolhouses. They cleared up the
grounds about them, planted trees and
made the grass grow and taught the
young ones to take pride In having a
beautiful lawn around the building
outside and artistic wall and other
decorations inside. Besides that they
obtained by subscriptions some valua
ble books for the public school libra
rles.
It is well usually to have men as
members of these village Improvement
socleties, to assist with their experi
ence and money. But the business
work of the organizations must in
nearly every case be done by women,

Whether farm life and village life

ing of a most excellent and sensible
traveling cloak. This can be made of
black taffeta silk. of poplinette or of
serviceable mohair. No lining is neces
sary. The one in the illustratiop is of
black taffeta and has a trimming made
of ribbed mohair braid, with a couple
of fancy steel and jet buttons at the
bust. In the back the garment hangs
loosely and has two rows of the braid
down the center. This braid is the
lightest made and the only kind suit
able for taffeta. It is also suitable for
mohair, which resembles silk so close
ly. The sleeves are loose, as they
should be for a dust and traveling
loak. They are lined with plaid silk.

ORGANIZED FARM WOMEN.
Agrleltural Union Among Colored
Vomeuen of the South.
The saying that in union is strength
is as old as the world, but the w(,rhI
has been a long time finding out how
true it Is. Among those in whom the
genius of co-operation and united cf
fort at length beIgins to move and thrill
are the colored women of the south.
This for them is the brightest sign of
the future.
Sol;ie time ago negro farmers of Tex
as founded an improvement society,
designed to foster thrift and scientitie
agriculture among their own people.
Imnmediately the women of their race
organized what is called the "'Barnyard
Auxiliary" of the Farmers' Improve
ment society. The object of the larn
yarders is distinctly and definitely to
develop the live stock industry among
colored women of the south. 'lTheoe
earnest, brainy negro women finally
understand and know that industrial
training In the things they are doing,
the busin - : immediately under their
noses, is what they need even more
than literary and professional educa
tion.
Accordingly they will devote them
selves to bee culture and to the rear
ing for market of poultry and domestic
animals. Swine breeding will be in
cluded in their list, likewise dairying.
First of all, they will make these In
dustries pay-industries of which ev
ery one can be conducted at home.
There the women will stay, not fooling
after things they cannot reach, but
cleaning up their barnyards, studying
A BABNYABDBE.
the science and art of poultry and pig
raising, of beekeeping and dairying.
They will bring the best products in
these lines to market and then shrewd
ly claim the best price. The negro
men will attend to .he m! es and
crops. The bomekeeping women will
rear and Improve the small live stock
and put on sale choice butter and milk.
Already this noble union of women
has a membership of 2.500. They have
bought 50.000 acres of land in different
places and possess a united capital of
$700,000.
Grilled haddock is a very tasty dish,
but spoiled unless the fire is perfectly
clear. First split a haddock open so
that it will lie fiat, wipe It thoroughly
dry, smooth the flesh with a broad
bladed knife, brush it over with oil
and dredge dry flour over it. Broil
upon a well greased gridiron, putting
the skin side first to the fire; broil both
sides, dish on a napkin.
