A planter residing near this city
infornms us that hle has had fifty ap
plications at least, since the cotton
planting time drew near, for cotton
seed for planting. Is it not strange
thiat people should he s, foolish as to
dispose of all their cotton seed and
then beg fronm their neighbors to
plant, when the price obtained for
the seed is nothing comnpared to what
would result if they fertilized their
lands with it.
It has been estimated, and that
Very closely, that a ton of cotton seed
is worth to a farmer, as ia fertilizer
$22, buill they persist every year in sel
ling the seed to oil Companies at $5
per ten, or at $15 loss to them.
It is useless to talk of prosperity
in a country a here corn sells at one
dollar per bushel in the early Spring,
and the farmers of begging about fot
cottonl seed to plant. Politics don't
bring tIon such ruin as that-its stu
pidity, and this country will he worth
nothing until that style of planting
is changed.
M'ining the Soil.
(Home Journal.]
I believe, says a writer on tihe sub
ject of prepFlitg soil, one of our
greatest *iaslkre in fairm hIsiess is
made in our undule haste when sow
ing and cultivating our crops. We
are in so mnich hgI r to get the seed
Ato the gr.ound that we do not take
time to lloperlly fit the soil for its
iceeption' We plow the land, run a
pulverizer or harrow over it once,
sow or plant the seed. and cover it as
soon possible. Sometimes we do not
do as much as this. I have known a
man to plow heavy land for oals, and
sow the seed on the furrows. Of
course the suflace was very rouglh
and broken--nothing but a succes
sion of ridges and hollows and large
clods--utterly nifit to receive the
seed. But the farmer was in a hurry
and could not stop to harrow the
land befeore sowing. Planting is very
often done on land that is not half
ftted. And, as it wonld be natural
to expect, a mian who is in too much
hurry to get his land in good order to,
plant is generally in too great haste
to thorouglhly cultivate the growing
crop. He runs the cultivator or
olrse-hoe between the rows once or
twice drting the season, and thinks
this is all he can afford to do. But
here lie makes a great mistake-one
of thle greatest mistakes which ihe can
make in his whole business. By this
course le greatly diminishes his crops
and reduces his profits, for tile profit
of farm crops lie in a large yield per
acre. A small yield only pays ex
penses. And it is the haste with
which the land is prepared and the
aeglect which the creep receives which
occasions the low yields of which so
many farmers complain, and which
bare the way to success in their busi
ness. I am convinced, both by ex
perience and observation, that it is
useless to run over our land. We
ought not to plant more than we can
cultivate thloroughly. If we have
already got tloo large an area planlted,
let us hIre extra help and cultivate
the crop well. Another year we can
plnt less. Less planting and more
cullivation would be a good motto for
the average farmer. 'lThe soil con
tains many of the elements of plant
food, but it must be pinlverized ee
fore the crop can rendily obtain thenm.
'he finer we make the soil, the ricer
the bed in wlhich to put thie seed, the
easier and faster tihe plants canl ,h
tain their food. Thils is a prineiple
of which we have been slow to take
the advantage, lbut one wiich we
ought to understand and apj'ly. It
certainly lies at tile very founldation
of economical and successful cultiva
tion.
Most Batter From Scalded Milk.
lMr. Charles Day, Orleans cnunty,
?T. Y., states that one of his neigh
dors i. in tile habit of scalding tihe
milk inl her dairy, and he wishes to
hnow if thie cream will really rise any
qnileker "anld will tllhere be any more
cream by the scalding, and, if so,
whLy 1"- To which I answer, it is true
that scalding milk while fresh from
the.ow or perfectly sweet and set
ting it while hot in shalllow vessels
FVr the cream to rise makes the cream
riee 'more radidly than to set it in the
same way without scalding, and there
will be a slight increase of buttter.
There are several reasons for this: 1.
Creabi rises faster when nlilk is hot
thanwhen it is cold, all other condi.
tlons being the same. Hence thile hot
milk sends np its cream sooner thlan
the milk set at a lower temperature.
Netwithstanding the loss of water by
inenasaed evalporation, Ilealed milk is
thinner or more flunid than milk not
scalded. Thlis result is probably
ccasioned by thie destruction of
orpanic germs killed in scalding. The
Ii-sag gt.m hinder the ascenet of tihe
usasr. 8. Cream rises faster when
tihe temperature of the milk is fialling
than when It is stationary, and milk
set hot has a wider range of tempers
tare to fall tlhrough than that not
idhlded, and sends its cream to the
srahee more perfectly. There is al
ways a part of the cream left back in
the milk, but, for the reason given,
there Is less left back in the scalded
than ino the nnasealded milk. 4. Tilhe
eream from the scalded milk churns
asder tihn that from milk not sealded,
and hence charns more completely,
baving less ancharned cream 'in tilhe
bettermilk. Hence a little more
buttet Ie the general result of scalded
ad settlng in shallow vessels. TIhe
sream, however, Is less bulky bot
more trish l butter In hut than in cold

For the principles by which The World
will be governed in its discussion sad
treatment of the public questions, it will
suffice to say that The World, while coua
servative in politics, desires the eoaneev
tion only of what is good and wise in ou
public institions and no limitations nupo
the right of private judgment andttl
aspirations of Reform, save those whic
are imposed by prudence decorum, an
a rational respect for vested rightas a
for the honest opinions of all elassesai
sects of men. While it has labored f~t
the principles and hails the triumphed
the Democratic party as affording va
practical promise of Reform in our publb
administrations, city, state and nationlO
it will not be blindly devoted tothe ad
vancement of any party or any cliqut
It will freely canvass the public conducnt
while it will treat with respect thepi.'
vate rights, of Public Men, and it will eti
amine fearlessy into the workingsofoi r
national, state and municipal govern
ments.
It will inculcate a steadfast relile
upon the original principles o oour poll
tical system as the only sound basis of a
needed imporvement therein; an unfalP
ering devotion to the Constitution sad
the Union, a scrupulous fidelity to th
spirit as well as the letter of our la~;i
and a sleepless vigilance in maintainin
all the great safeguradls of Civil se
Religions Liberty. It will seek to mit
igate and not to aggravate the evils i1
separable from Party Government in a
Free Country; to promote good and not
ill feeling among our fellow-citensof i,
creeds and colors, all sectiohs andÂ£a
sects; and to advance both by its pre
cepts and by its example the telgti
Reason and of Law over prejudiCE l'

make i's columns a terror to evil-does
and a praise to them that do well.
Nor will it lose sight meanwhile of th
