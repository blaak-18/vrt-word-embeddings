since in an obituary no'ice the word

"trusting, trying hymns." It sesms
impossible ,to guard againat thcee

A PUKNITELKl PACTORY.
Sbreveport has the assurance of a
furniture factory, and to the eff )rts
of the Iudustrial and' Commircial
League must be credited the suc
cessful result. To develop and pros
per the city must have diversified
industries which give eeoployment to
wag eearners.
These words which flsahcd through
the mind, when reproduced in cold
type and analyzed, are significant.
Tae groat body of the people are too
busy and being preoccupied with
their own affairs give little thought
to practical, material development.
It is manifest then, that the few
must think, and plan and work sys
tematically to secure substantial re
- suits.
Not many years ago the Develop.
meet club was orgauized through the
s caucasian and its record is tilled with
good work. The club had reached
its greatest mark of efficleucy when
the construction of the Kiausas City
was assured. The prosperity ex-,
perienced from the building of
this railway and other improvements
then in operation had a tendency to
creck its usefulness and the club,
finally reacted the peculiar condition
of being neither dead or alive.
It has been demoistras.d' that ih
dustrial clubs or leagus are essential
to the development of the prosperity
of a city. What is everybody's busi
ness is nobody's business. Shreve
port is-fortunate in having a league
under efficient management which is
directing the commercial and indus
trial Interests to fruitful ends. With
out thts league this furniture factory
would not have been secured. To be
brief it may be said that Mr. R.-G.
Morrow, president of the New Or
leans Farulture Company and the
vice president of the Memphis Fnrni
ture company, having a plant at
Vicksburg, Miss, as a represen- 1
tation of thr parties Interested, has
agreed to have erected and operated
a furniture taetory which is to cost y
not less than $30,000, and which will i
be enlarged .nd improved to reach
the pricy of $50,0,00, whose output t
will range from $150,000 to $26v,000, ,
and will give employment at the be- i
ginning to at least one hundred men, t
which number is to be increased to
two hundred men. It is agreed that
toe plant shall be operated during d
the term of ten years, and should at e
any period before this limit the com- "
pany should cease or discontinue op- r
oration, the site and the improve- p
meats will revert to the city. To r
secure this plant, the Commerclal and
Industrial League Is pledged to pay 1
to the companr a bonus of *8,000, si
and this amount is to be subscribed u
by citisens who will be requested to a
contribute, by a comnmlttee who will
mate their call during the week It h
is an all Important matter, a question o
which no good citizen will treat E
lightly, and which will, no doubt a
ti
receive a generous response from all f,
classes, especially the property own- h
ors. But let there be a willing, ready at
and liberal answer, to the fullest Ct
means of every man who desires to t
promote the welfare end steady pro- o
grees of the city. v

"THE BOKS WILL NOT STAY
WHlI1PPD."
Not long since the report was giveu
by telegraph that Lord Kitchener was
about to gobble up the wily General
DeWet, who could not escape from
General Knox. From this report it
was only natural to assume that the
Boers would all be captured and the
cinel war be wound up in glorious
peace, but at that very moment Gun
orals Clement and DeLevy swiped
down on the noglish troops who were
defeated with the loss of a number
of officers. Why will not these Boers
stay whipped? If they would only
surrender unconditionally, but the
Boers have no bettor judgment and

and always gave the beet advice. The
conatess and her daughter, Lady Astelto,
had gone from Uaglaid to Spain, in search
of a milder climate, for a great portion of
England, as damp and f'ggy. Having
acqualatances and friende it Pertugat
they went to Lisbon, which is right in
front of the oeean, and there purohased a
heme whioh we are attemptaing to locate
and describe. They were members of the
church of England, and often attended
tnas little churoh, as it was the nearest
ont to them, and sometimes they would go
over to the synagogue mad hear the awe it
voice of tse organast, and the soft tone of
the organ, as it pealed forth its notes,
given out by the touch of thi stylish and
handsome organist, erinoess Clara, that
on certain great religiois days neede.1 the
finishing touch of the artist, to son forth
to heaven, ani atonement days offerings,
for the siss of the whole people. As she
sat there, looking as saintly as St. Mary
herself, and as handsome as a picture, she
was the admiration of the church, that
part we mean that loved beauty and
kindness of heart. Her hair luxuriant rich
in color, and of an auburn brown, her
profile features like some queen of kng
land, who broke as many hearts as she
was cruel, we do not mean tnis organist,
for she loved everybody, both young and
old, and had a kind word for al', that made
her friends among young men and several
elder men, that visited her once a week
and sometimes oftener. Three of these
elder men often met there together, and sat
in silence on a winter's evening; when all
was blustry and wintery outside, and
listened to the sweet songs and strains of
Mendelskoa or Strauss, which tapered
ligers bent upon ivory keys, brought
forth to cheer and please. Sometimes her
pretty ceusin would delight the three
with some sweet, and sometimes funny
songs, to cheer the pilgrims on their weary
j3urney, for all had been failures, and had
not captured up to date the most valuable
gift that Heaven bestowed on man, so some
books say, but some who have the prizes
now, by manner and treatment deny, for
actions speak louder than word,, and if the
song of poor Marguerite was changed
would say: "He loved me, he loved me, but
now he loyes as aot." The author has
sever seen anythlr of this iatd in others,
being too busy in other matters himself,
