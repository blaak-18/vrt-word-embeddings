Bryan and the Question of
Social Equality
Dear Sir:—lf you can possibly
spare the time to answer the follow
ing questions through The Jefferson
ian weekly I will certainly appreciate
it:
(Ist) In your speech in Atlanta,
October 7, 1908, you stated that W.
J. Bryan favored social equality, that
he educated his children in a social
equality school,, and that he gave
$2 50 of his own money every year
to support it. Now the Bryanites
are giving it the lie. I have offered
to go with any of them to Nebraska,
and if it is not true I am to pay the
expenses, and if it is true they are to
pay them.
Now, if any of them accepts my
offer, where and to whom can I go
to get the proof?
(2d) What becomes of the tariff
money intended for protection? Does
it go to the Government, or does the
manufacturer get it?
(3d) Do you not think that a good
way to teach Jeffersonian principles
would be to formulate them into a
drama, also the laws that are rob
bing the people now, and organize
clubs and meet, say once a month,
and have exercises showing the peo
ple exactly how they are being rob
bed in an indirect way. If you will
fomulate one showing how the na
tional banker is robbing the people
and how our constitutional money
system would put a stop to it, I will
organize a club and we will try it.
The majority of the people are so
blamed ignorant that they don’t
know which end is up half the time,
yet they are allowed to vote.
Hoping that I may hear from you
through the weekly,
Your friend and admirer,
J. G. BLOODWORTH.
Carrollton, Ga.
P. S. —I hope you will succeed in
establishing a daily Jeffersonian in
Atlanta. J. G. B.
Answers.
(1) Yes, I made the statement re
ferred to, and was authorized by
facts to say that Mr. Bryan had edu
cated his children in social equality
schools and colleges. In the State
of Nebraska there is no law against
the intermarriage of blacks and
whites, and such marriages occur.
There is no separation of the races
in hotels, theatres, etc. There is no
separation of the two races in the
lower schools, or in the University
of Nebraska itself. Inasmuch as Mr.
Bryan has never raised his voice
against the Nebraska social equality
laws and schools, and inasmuch as
he himself indorsed them by sending
his children to be educated in them,
(when he was amply able to send
them to white schools,) I was justi
fied in landing that blow upon him,
above the belt. I thought the South
ern people ought to know the facts,
in order that they might realize what
danger there would be to the South’s
future if the Democrats elected a
man of those views President of the
United States.
You must remember that Mr.
Bryan was born in Illinois, was rear
ed in the atmosphere of abolitionism,
and comes as naturally by his social
equality principles and practice as we
Southern people do by the opposite.
Neither you nor I have any right to
question Mr. Bryan’s sincerity in
the matter, nor his perfect freedom
in the choice of where and how he
would educate his boys and girls:
but, since he chose, as a matter of
free choice, to educate them on the
plane, of social equality with negroes,
I think it nothing but right that the
Southern people should know the
truth.
All you will have to do, if those
people will accept your challenge, is
to go straight to Lincoln, Nebraska,
call at the office of the President of
the University of Nebraska, and ask
him for the facts as to whether or
not young negro men and young ne
gro women are not received into that
college on terms of social equality
with the whites. As to Mr. Bryan’s
son and daughter being students of
that college, their catalogues will
show the names. As to there being
mixed schools and mixed marriages,
as well as social equality in public
places, all that you have to do is to
visit that State and visit the schools
and public places, inquiring of teach
ers, hotel keepers, merchants, etc.
My secretary is a Virginia lady,
and she tells me that some of her
friends who attended the University
of Nebraska stated to her that ne
groes were in the classes on terms of
social equality.
(2) You will understand that the
tariff is a tax placed on foreign goods
when brought into this country for
sale. The ships enter our ports, and

the goods have to go through our
Custom Houses, where the value,
quality, etc., are determined upon
and the tax assessed.
Now, suppose a foreigner has suits
of clothes which in his country sell
for sls per suit. Suppose that he
imports a cargo of this clothing to
New York. If it is woolen goods, he
will have to pay, at the very lowest
calculation, 100 per cent, tariff duty.
This, of course, is equal to sls. Now,
you will see at once he can’t afford
to sell the goods in this country, un
til he adds the amount of the tax to
the European value. In other words,
his sls suit of clothes will be sold for
not less than S3O. Now, suppose, that
the American manufacturer has wool
en gods of exactly the same quality.
What’s to keep him from selling at
$29.50 — lower than the foreigner can
afford to do? In other words, the
tariff tax enables the American man
ufacturer to add to his price at
least as much as the amount of tax
which the foreigner has to pay to get
bis license to sell in this market.
What the foreigner pays, the govern
ment gets; what the manufacturer
adds to his price because of the li
cense fee which the foreigner has to
pay, he pockets, and the government
doesn’t get a cent of it. The lowest
estimate is, that the American manu
facturers pocket $5. under the tariff
system where the government gets
sl.
(3) Your idea about the drama is
a clever one, and if some genius
could work it out in attractive liter
ary form, it might indeed work won
ders. When “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”
was dramatized, the abolition move
ment gained immensely. In Great
Britain, not long ago, a play was pro
duced which went upon the idea of
England's helplessness in the event
of a German invasion. It created a
furor, and started young men to en
listing in the army.
