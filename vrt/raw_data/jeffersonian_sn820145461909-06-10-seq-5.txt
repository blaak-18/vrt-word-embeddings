OLD JUNE.
Old June is coming; all the rills
Are singing a green passage for
her feet;
And all the rapture of the waiting
hills
Is throbbing in the breath of roses
sweet,
And every crooning South wind soft
ly trills
A note to make her melody com
plete.
Old June is coming; while the sun
beams dart
Among the coverts where the dense
gloom clings.
Deep in the-forest where the gay
greens part
The wild bird sits beside his nest
and sings.
What matters it that one sad, hu
man heart
Goes sobbing for another, dead
June’s, things?

THE GIRL’S CAREER.
A great many girls and young men
are getting through school and col
lege this month, and the question of
“What shall I do with myself?” is
forcing itself unpleasantly, or pleas
antly upon them. One thing the
young man knows: he must get to
work at something. He may choose
what he pleases, from rail-splitting
to the presidency of the United
States, but do something he must.
He has not the choice of staying at
home at the expense of his father.
But for the girl the question is not
so simple. She will get married if
she can find a good man who will
take care of her. Her father will
probably see to it that she does not
marry any other kind, if there is any
chance to keep her from it. He
knows, as she cannot, that a bad man,
a brutal man who drinks, or a lazy,
trifling fellow, who will not make a
support for his wife, is worse than
no husband at all, and a girl had bet
ter be an old maid ten times over
than become the wife of a lazy man
or a drunkard. Well do I remember
how in my youthful days I was taught
to regard “the lazy man” and “the
drunkard” as but little better than
“the bad-man,” and I am very glad
of it, having seen what I have seen
of the families of lazy men and
drunkards.
If a girl does not see any prospect
of making a good marriage she prob
ably does not feel like staying at
home and raising chickens. This is
by all means the best thing that she
can do, but it is not usually the thing
that most appeals to her youthful
imagination. She wants to see some
thing of the world and have a more
exciting career than the poultry busi
ness offers. This is natural, and
therefore a thing that is hard to com
bat; yet for a girl to go to a city and
enter into some kind of business —
stenography or the like —is often as
disastrous to her happiness as an ill
advised marriage with a lazy man or
a drunkard would be. Business and
matrimony are very much alike in
one respect: once entered into they
are hard to get out of again. The
very father or brother who will ob
ject most strenuously to the girl’s
going to work will, when she begins
making a salary of forty or fifty dol
lars a month, perhaps seventy-five or

a hundred, will demur at the sugges
tion of her giving it up to return
home to add to the burdens there.
It would be much better for a girl
of she would start something at
home —teaching, poultry or bee
keeping, or even stenography in a
near-by town; and save up money to
go away on visits to places where
more excitement may be found. She
will then have an opportunity to test
for herself whether or not it is worth
while to give up a home, which can
never be regained, for the less cer
tain joys that her imagination has
pictured.
rhe trouble with a girl’s trying to
do anything at home is that usually
she does not go into it in the right
way to make it a real money-making
business. If she undertakes to raise
poultry she invests in an incubator
and a few fancy eggs, and attends to
business when she has nothing else
to do. Put as much time and intel
ligence into it as she does into her
employer’s business as a stenogra
pher and she would make far more
money and be oh, so much more in
dependent than as a working girl. I
have seen working girls who went to
work at eight o’clock and got home
after six in the evening. They did
their sewing on Sundays and their
laundry work —to save money—at
night and in the morning before time
to go to work. Suppose they were
to put an equal amount of time and
energy into the poultry business!
They could then do for themselves
what they are now doing for an em
ployer, and get the wealth which
they are helping their employer to
accumulate.
To the girl whose father is able to
support her now and to provide for
her future there is open of all lives
the most pleasant and care-free. I
do not mean a life of idleness, for
that is the most miserable; but a life
devoted to some pursuit for which
she has a particular taste or talent.
A girl, for instance, who has a talent
for music, with a little money at hei'
disposal, might make of herself a
finished musician. In so doing she
would give something of real value
to the world—of as much value as
a half dozen or so of children, of
which the world has already a gen
erous surplus.
“Race suicide,” I hear some one
exclaim with horror; but when we
look back four hundred years and
see how oui' country was then a
howling wilderness and observe it
now, with its thousands of cities
peopled with millions of people it
does not seem as though there were
much danger yet of race suicide.
This is a question to trouble future
generations. The problem for us is
the improvement and education of
teeming millions who are now bur
dening the country.
Higher education in this country
is left almost entirely to those young
women who have no other demands
upon their time, and if it were not
for their accomplishments in college
and afterwards in conservatory and
art schools our people would be even
more shockingly ignorant of music
and art than they are now. A few
girls in a town or community who
3effersonian
can play well, not jingles but real
music, or who can draw and paint—
not daub—give tone to the whole
community in which they live. To
say that the lives of such girls are
useless is almost as absurd as if we
should say the thrifty farmers of a
community had no excuse for being.
For “He who made us gave us not
this large discourse and god-like
reason to rust in us unused.”
S. A. S.
THE WOMAN AFTER MARRIAGE.
When a woman marries she, in
nine cases out of ten, suffers from
arrested mental growth, if indeed
she was ever progressively inclined.
Her outlook on the world in general
becomes smaller, her views cramped,
her horizon confined to the four
walls of her home, her household
cares, and the round of social du
ties. If before marriage she has
been engaged in business, mixing
with men and women in the free
masonry engendered by business life,
this sudden restriction will doubtless
prove very irksome, and it rests
mainly with herself with the
strength of her own personality—
whether she be able to break these
bonds. On the one hand, she may
prove herself to be a large-hearted,
open-minded woman, taking an in
telligent interest in the affairs of
life, and capable of wisely advising
her husband in business matters; on
the other, she will either develop
into a genteel housemaid or live a
life of elegant idleness, according to
her social status.
Many men think that women have
no business qualifications, and they
come home in the evening tired and
cross, making a mountain out of
every mole-hill, while, if they would
remember that two heads are better
than one, and unburden themselves
of their worries, a woman’s ready
wit will often find an easy way out
of a difficult situation.
Hobbies indulged in before mar
riage should not be neglected, and
every woman, no matter how busy
she may be, should find time to read.
A broad outlook on everything in
general is not incompatible with the
highest development of the wife and
mother. No woman should entirely
sacrifice her own development and
social obligations, even for the sake
of the home. While husband and
family naturally come first in her re
gard, mental growth is surely as im
portant to a woman as to a man; in
a measure, more so, as the mother is
the one who has the larger share of
a child’s training.
For the sake of her children, she
ought to cultivate her mind, and just
as she strengthens her own charac
teristics so, by constant association
and learning, will the same traits ap
pear in the children. There is not
the slightest necessity for baby-talk;
it is a foolish custom, and makes
both mother and child appear at a
disadvantage. As soon as a child
can speak the parents ought to talk
to him, not in the rounded periods
they would use in conversing with a
person of their own age, but cor
rectly as regards pronunciation. The
little tongue may not get every diffi
cult word perfect just at once, but
time will remedy that. Childish cu
riosity must never remain unan
swered, unless in the case of ridicu
lous questions to which no intelli
gent answer can be given. This
habit should be checked; but where
a child shows a genuine thirst for
information, that ought to be grati
fied in as simple and interesting a
manner as possible, but not to the
extent of cramming.—Paris Modes.
EVE UP TO DATE.
The long directoire handle is
much approved on parasols.
Gold fringe is still much used on
sashes, scarfs and tunic draperies.
Colored linens are all the rage and
are modishly tailored in various
styles.
Wreaths and garlands of woodland
flowers are among the garnitures for
chapeaux.
Shell ornaments are in great vogue
for the hair, and they come in many
fancy designs.
Soutache braid is so popular that
even the daintiest lingerie waists em
ploy it as trimming.
Big metal buttons are used for
summer gowns, and when jeweled,
they make an unusually pretty mo
dish trimming.
Corduroy skirts, in all the new
shades, are shown for the modish
who expects to do mountain climb
ing this summer.
Even in summer gowns the
Frenchy touch of black is used and
gives the distinctly smart air that is
so much desired.
Charlotte Corday hats are seen a
great deal this season, and the laces
and nets of which they are made are
distinctly pretty and becoming.
No coiffure is quite up-to-date un
less it is ornamented some way, eith
er with bows, aigrettes, flowers, in
fact everything and anything is seen.
A brand new shaped bonnet is one
that seems to be all crown and no
brim, and looks for all the world
like a waste basket fastened on one’s
head.—Birmingham Age-Herald.
The Spirit Moved Him.
An old negro preacher approached
a Southern physician and offered him
a scrap of paper.
“Please, sar, to read dat,” he said.
The physician found it to be an
advertisement in which it was assert
ed that whisky was the only genuine
and reliable specific for malaria.
“But you haven’t any malarie,
Uncle,” he assured the old man;
“none of it around here at all.”
“Whar do dey hab it de wust,
Mars’ Jeems?” the other then asked,
curiously.
“It’s pretty bad down on Cypress
River,” the physician told him,
naming a locality some twenty miles
away.
A few days later the physician was
passing the old fellow’s cabin and
observed him climbing upon a rick
ety wagon piled high with household
goods.
“Moving, Uncle Ned?” he asked.
“Where are you going?”
“Mars’ Jeems,” the old man said,
solemnly, “Ah done had a call; de
spirit done move me to go wuck in
de Lord’s vineyard on de banks ob
Cypress ribber.”—Harper’s Weekly.
