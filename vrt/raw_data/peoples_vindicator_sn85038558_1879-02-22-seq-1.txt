Finally in our journeyings we reach.
ed Houston, Texas. While I was
standing oataide the canvas one day
a young man came up and accosted
me with 'Are ye! the man that's got
the tight-rope walker ? If so, you
ought to have a jamper.'
"'Well, what thea ?'
" 'I'm he.'
" 'Can you jump?'
"'I can beat Sam Patch all to piec

"'What's youear business '
"'Oh, I'm a reporter, but I want to

"1 looked him over; he was a hlittle
bit of fellow; dida't' way a haundred
pounds, and so this you could almost
read newspaper through hibs.
"Why,' said I, 'you won't do; you
are too light; half a gust of wind
woold blow yeou away.'
"'0h,' said he, 'don't you make
any mistake about me; lama report
er, and whatever we undertake, we
do. I tell you I acn jump; now try
me.'

I took him to a freigh builda negar

"'Well,' thought I, 'may hbe there
