TIfE PARISH MOJE Y.
In, the Lafayette Advertiser of
the 8th inst. there appeared an edi
torial bitterly complaining of the
refusal of t'be, Poiice jury to accept
the offer of the People's State Bank
tt take the parish funds on deposit
and to pay therefore two per cent.
interest on daily balances.
The editor seems quite surprised
that the proposition was "regarded
by some of our people entirely new
and possibly inimical to the parish."
Jje seems a little irritated. He
attempts to create the impression
that thePolice Jury, in its desire to
subserve some individual benefit,
lost sight of the interest of the pub
lic in the matter-the amount re
suhig from the d per cent.
The statement is made "that the
custom of banks being made the
depositories of public funds, and
paying interest upon them prevails
throughout the length and breath of
this land."
In his endeaver to substantiate
his position that that custom pre
vails he refers to Article t r5 of the
Revised Civil Code. But from his
own statement of what those provi
sions are, he forgets that this is a
special statute. referring to special
funds held by administrators, cura
tors, etc. They are not fwblicfuneds.
He also refers to the law creating
a fiscal agent for the S ate. This
also does not apply. It refers to
the State funds, and not to parish
funds.
It is well known that parishes are
political corporatiods with powers
limited to those expressly delegated
to them by the legislature.
We venture the assertioh that he
will look in vain for any law creat
ing or authorizing the creation of fis
cal agents for parishes-or towns in
this' State.
Police Juries,as stated above, have
limited powers.
"-clhey are especially restricted in
matth rs concerning the levy of taxes,
and the -disbursement of public
funds. The law very zealously
guards the interest of the people in
t'.se-respcts. Jt -would, indeed,
'be a poor goverment, which boasts
of being a government "'by the peo
ple and for the people," if the-pub
lie funds, taken from the toil of
the citizen, could be raised without
limit, and not protected and kept
sacred.
The law which gives the powers
to Police Juries is very plain. Sec.
2743 of the Revised Statutes defin
ing the powers of the Police Juries,
provides:
Tenth-To appoint a treasaurcr for the
parish.
Centainly, po one will deny that
from the nature of that proposition,
the Police Jury naturaly came to the
conclusion, that if the funds had
been deposited the bank was to use
it in its business ; that the proposi
tion of the bank to pay a per cent.
interest on the deposit, was not
made for glory; that the object was
to use in loans on satisfactory in
dorsements or on mortgages at a
higher rate of interest, and that it
was a business proposition, carry
ing wit& lithe privilege of specula
ting upon, agd using, the public
funds in its manifold money tran
actions as practiced in the business
of State banks.
The power to inaugurate a system
of speculation with public funds is
not expressly delegated in the pro
vision of law contained in section
*743, above referred to.
Public office is a public trust and
public funds levied for specified
puroses, and wrested from the
citizen tot.defray the expenses of
overnment, should not and cannot
diverted from its legitmate uses
for private gain, or to jingle in the
coffers of institutions established for
speculation.
4t As a matter of power or right to
~'do so, the fact that the proposition
h' mande by a home institution that
~all.1euld like to see prosper, does
the question.
tconfident that- the bank
have `renderedt accottnt
,we conoti conaivea how the
Ptlice '"Jury corilWpe rlit speCl
lation with public fuji, in absqie
of express legislative auithority.
And such being the 'prbovisi of
the Revised Statutes, it is refreshing
to see the surprise of the editor of
the Advertiser that that proposition
"would seem to be regarded by some
of our people as entirely new and
possibly inimical to the parish."
The Advertiser further says: "It
is said that if the parish funds are
deposited with the bank, they will
be used, and such ought not to be.
Just why this argument does not
weigh against an individual doing
the same kind of business the bank
is engaged, is not explained."
This is very unkind. It is un
kind against the Police Jury because
it is based on an assumption.
The Police Jury can hardly be
charged to presume that the treasu
rer is using the parish funds in his
business, when the law prohibits
and punishes it, and when as a mat
ter of fact he has the funds in cash
in a separate box for the purpose,
and which is invariably counted by
the committees of the Police Jury
and School Board, in preparing
their reports on the finances.
We believe that our Police Jury
have- performed a plain duty by re
fusing the proposition ; ,that ihey
were actuated by good and pwre-:
motives and without any considera
tion of individual benefit, and that
by not allowing speculation with
public funds they have established
a safe and wholesome rule and have
subserved pub/lic interest.
EXPRESS YOUR OPINION.
A petition was presented to the
city coucil, at its sitting last
Monday, asking that body to recon
sider and recall the resolution pas
sed at a previous meeting against
permitting the roaming of cattle on
the streets of the town.
To reach the sense of the people,
on this question, which, by the way,
has raised some discussion, it has
been decided to hold an election,
under the supervision of the town
council, on Thursday, the 2oth ins
tant, where an expression of opi
nion on the matter is invited. It is
thought, by these means, a fair test
of public opinion can be had.
There are two sides to the ques
tic n.
On the one hand it is contendced
that the putting in effect of this re
solution will entail hardship on the
poor, who are dependent on the
milk of a cow or two for a living,
by th fact that their means are so
limited that' 'Ma cannot afford to
pay asturage, Tence they will be
suffe lrs.
On the cr hand it is claimed
that t fl'gaming of cattle cause
much da- to the side walks,
destroy the curbing of the ditches,
and at night are a menace and nui
sance to the pedestrian. And, that
inasmuch as there is aparish stock
law against the roaming of cattle at
large, the cattle owned by the town
people would be confined within
the limits of the corporation for
grazing grounds.
Here, then, are the two sides. It
is for the people themselves to pass
upon the issue. The Council will
be guided by the majority vote cast
either way, therefore, it behooves
every one interested and qualified
to cast his vote according to his
convictions.
Remember, the day and date,
Thursday July 20, 1893.
TIlE ROAD CONTRACT.
The Police Jury met in special
session last Monday and devoted
that clay and part of Tuesday look
ing into the alleged violation of the
contract held by the public road
contractor, Mr. I. N. Satterfield.
It is nominated in the contract that
the contractor "binds and obli
gates himself to deliver on or be
fore the first day of May A. P.
1893, the forty miles, more or less
of the roads contracted for, * * *
well and thoroughly graded and
drained," etc.
That is, in good traveling condi
tion, in consideration of "*$2,o00 per
annum for four " and $z per
acre additiona all necessary
hedges cut dow
On the first day of May 5893, as
events proved, the contractor was
not ready to meet the requirements
of his contract. The Police Jury
allowed the matter to go over with
out taking any action in the prem
ises, we say without taking any ac
tion, because the published ,official
proceedings d@' not contain a word
in- reference tro the matter. And
this they did in the face of this
clause of the contract:
r. The failurp, netlict, or re
famI at anyv tiner on the Jpart of the co~ntrac
t e eg"ty nd raned, de punblic
tditlat is cntra~cted, fay..or SAW., ar
tlhreoZf according lb the "'t' of thisa . ar
tract, and as herein provided, then qnd In
that case, the epnntract entered nate this day,
shall by sach fatlure, neglect or refusal be
eirp faco, rescinded, annulled, and of no ef
fet, aid the Police Jury shall be-entitled to
recover damages against the said contractor
and sureties, if any has been sustained.
Another two months rolled by,
July i, 1893 arrives, and still the
contractor is not ready to meet the
demands of his contract, 'which
should have been fulfilled two
months before, but makes the re
quest to be granted "an extension
of go90 days in order to comply with
the terms of his contract" and to
quote the record, -Mr. Satterfield
in his own behalf made a statement
as to the difficulties which delayed
the working of the roads, and said
that he had not been able to attend
personally to the work heretofore,
but if granted an extension of time,
as prayed for, would promise in
future," etc., etc.
The Police Jury granted the fore
going request, and added the provi
so that he (the contractor) forfeit
$5oo V'Po not "-complying with the
terms of his contract.
The contractor received - before
the Ist of May last somnething like
S 100 being instalments due on his
contract, and for cutting down
necessary hedges, both items being
lumped together. It is admitted
that he has done some work on the
public roads, but, utip to date not a
mile of road has been turned over
to, and received by the parish, in
accordance with the terms of the
contract.
For the faithful performance of
his contract Mr Satterfield furnish
ed a bond of $5oo00, with Mr. A. M.
Martin as surety.
The above are facts, and leads
The Gazette to employ the interro
gation point:
Did not the contract of iscef, ac
cording to the 9th clause of the con
tract, become null and void on the
ist of May, 1893?
If so, was it not the duty of the
Police Jury to so declare it, and at
once cause suit to be instituted
against the road contractor, and his
bondsman, for failure to comply
with the requirements of his con
tract ?
If the contract is, acccordling to
clause 9, null and void, can the l'o
lice Jury grant an extension on a
contract that does not exist ?
A POOR AS/.
The follt wing clilppedtl from the
"Questions and Answers" depart
ment in last Monday's T'imes-l)em
ocrat, will be read with some interest
by the people of Lafayette who may
yet retain a faint recollection of
having heard or read something
about a certain As ", riho appen;s
to be a mighty small stick:
Subscriber: According to the code gov
crning dueling in this State, is the challe,,;er
justified in posting the challengee as a cow
ard, because of selecting rifles when accept
ing a challenge ? 2 Is it not an established
usagec that the challengee have the choice of
arms ? 3 Is one Ash, of South Carolina,
autlhor of a Code on dlueling, recognized in
this State as an authority in such matters ?
Who is Ash ? What are his antecedents ?
If living, can you locate him ?
1. No.
2. Yes.
3. Cannot place Ash. IIc, however, is
not an authority in this State.
Burden Should Be Eqttal.
The Board of Reviewers last Tuesday
augmented the assessment roll by a consid
erable anmount in requiring the assessor to
place upoln his list the bank stock of the
People's State Iank, amouating to nearly
$2o,0o0, as well as all mortgages, notes, etc.,
found on record in the recorder's otice
amounting to nearly $60,ooo.
Thus it will be seen that these two items
alone amount to nearly SSo,ooo. Quite
a considerable sum which has heretofore es
capled taxation will swell the assessors roll
this year and pay a just proportion of the
ptul~Iic b,,rden. This is but just. The Ga
zette will however go a step further and ex
press the hope that next year, that the as
sessor, require every man, undler oath, to
give in every note in hand, all bonds, stock,
cash in hand, etc., as en,,tmcratcd it, the
law. This would distribute the burden of
taxation and relieve the farmers and real
estate owners, who have heretofore contri
buted nearly the entire revenues of the gov
ernment, State and parochial. The Ga
zette predicts that if this is ,lone properly
together with a true assessment of the mer
chandise held iu stock, by our merchants,
the rate of taxati,,n in Lafayette will soon
be reduced from to mills parish tax to about
one half that rate.
A14OOD BEGINNING.
A party, of public spirited citizens
frow our sister town of Breaux
Bridge composed of IDr. H. P. Guil
beau, JDr. F. R. Martin, Hon. C.
D)elhommer, Preston L. Guilbcau
Esq., Messrs. C. Jiabin, met some
some members of <the Business
Men's Association last Wednesday,
and had an informal talk over
the best means to be employed to
secure a branch railroad between
this town and Breaux Bridge. This
conference resulted in the adoption
of measures, we are told, that wil
he pished for all that is in them.
i bcn the line of action to be
faassg nproposed; ;i i` :" .1
-hope that if personal interest is 1
not st genough, that civic pride
will be an incentive powersi
enough to induce every man to pill
offads coat, as it were, and catch.
on to theiow line. WVith a steady
pull the tap can be landed.
Quick and easy transportation be
tween the two points would redound
to the benefit of not only the two
towns, but the country adjacent
wrould feel some of the benefits.
There can be no question that
such a tap would enhance the trade
of Lafayette, perhaps, so per cent.
while at the same time working to
the advantage of Breaux Bridge and
vicinity.
Let us all unite and do our level
best to get a branch rialroadl
Be On The Alert.
The Board of Trade of New Iberit 1set
Wednesday to "devise some plan for acting
in concert with St. Martinsville and Breaui
Bridge in inducing the Southern >facific
railroad company to run a rpd- from New
Iberia via Breaux Brio- 4i4a St. Martin
ville." -
What action the Board of Triade of New
Iberia tool. in regard to the matter, we do
nt:know. But one thing we do know is
that when New Iberia sets out to get anything
in this line, she generally succeeds, as the
Iberia and Vernmillion railroad attests.
Although Neiw Iberia knows that that
section is tributary to and the trade thereof
properly belongs to Lafayette, and that that
trade is worth ,having, are bending her
energies to get it. Will Lafayette sit su
pinely by and let New Iberia steal a march
on her? Breaux Bridge wants to be con
nected with Lafayette, but if Lafayette does
not make any efforts to meet her half way,
she will bid us good-bye and will join hands
with New Iberia. To prevent this 'unholy
alliance" we must at once
Get 7'gnfther.
Struck by Lightning.
A very severe wind and electrical
storm passed over Lafayette last
Tuesday evening. During the se
vere gale, heavy rain, and peals of
thunder, a bolt of lightning struck
the rear end of Mr. Jno. Vigneaux's
branch stable tearing away some of
the planking, the shock was a strong
one, and the horses were badly frigh
tened, we are told. The damage is
light. Another bolt struck and tore
away the corner of Mr. Vander
water's blacksmith shop. And still
another bolt fell upon and killed
a horse belonging to Mr. Lucien
Landrv. WVhile the storm lasted
but a short time, its severity was so
strong as to cause uneasiness to
many.
Additional Locals.
Juilc L'ebaillon was called pro
fe.s-noallv to Abbeville 'u'itrsday.
Messrs. H. I.. Fontenot and i'. II.
T'orian retturtned 'ThLursday from

had been on a plea-ture trip.
Thty 1reanting
It is particularly in the convnles:cnt stage
thit we are fain to hot1 , perforce, s-,li.trv
comn unings willth our own nature, and there
must then crecTr in our minds dreams neces
sary to the felicitous revelation of hap
piness or vain regret.
It is then that the visions ot our youth rise
up becfore us ; it is then that we look on the
vanished past, and smile, or sigh, in think
ing upon its changes.
Some, in these day-dreams, luxuriate upon
the delicious images raised by a happy life
a path that has always been strewn with flow
ers, and, it is then that such a soul revels,
in this happy retrospection, like a honey bee
among the fragrant flowers of springtime.
It is a moment of supreme contcntmaent.
Others, medlitate on a cruel destsny. They
look back through the vistas of the past, and
sorrowfully note that Time in passing over
the course had crushed out Hope's sweetesi
flower's, and left them to die in their early
bloom, and blighted their fragrance ere they
had scented with their sweet odor their
rugged path through life. Over the lonely
path his glance now rest upon what was then
a faint, but which now he knows was a
sparkling gem concealed. IHence no bright
dreams for contemplation, and, he can but
cling to a visioned future, hoping there is
yet something in store-some unknown and
uniimagined bliss; some fertile seat amid the
diesert waste, where bright and fragrant flow
crs may bloom again.
In the contemplation of these day dreams
some delicious, and some arid moments are
wasted. To some it is a pleasant delusion,
to others it forms a painful retrospection.
AssoDEUS.
Want a Road.
Edio/r Lafayette Gasette:
Please permit me to insert a few lines in
your columns regarding how we people of
the first ward are treated by our law-makers.
We have a public road, between Jacques
Mathiew and others, which has been closel
for over three years. WVe have done all
that we could to have this road opened,
but up to date nothing is done.
Mr. I). Arcenaux went before the law
makers asking them to have the road
opened-the result was that they laughed
at hitn. Siqgg that time we made a peti
tion of 49 ulghatures, and sent it to M0r. MI.
1'. Gordy in October, 189t, with the request
that he should take action before the grand
jury, but nothing was done. I, the author
of this card, have spoken to some of the law
makers. I always had a good word, but no
road opened.
This reminds me of my grand-father.
When I was a small boy I used to go about
hint to ask him nmany things. Hle would
always promise me the first colt that his
mare mule would have. But up to date I
a)m without the cojt. This is exactly the
same thing with the road question-they
promise, but no road. If any one want a
road they can at once get *e colt of their
mare mule, but no rdad.
I notice in the Advertiser the printing of
their resolution in regard to road overseer.
L The are required to bring a list of those who
had worked. I would like to know bow
they wont them to work in a six inch lane;
and many places completely closed and
*:
dam up back-warer. To laint
hli mande, and another grandfather
rranmise mad: but we - are yet. to get $ny
thin".
E think Itzevery mu^n would hbe tax*d tgee
dollars. sad the ruad sold to the lowest bitd
der, this would bring better ro.-ds, and have
the uoti.e written this way: 'VYuo are here
by nntified that your road tax is now due,
and if you desire to work same on public
road you will repast at......for duty. A
part or the whole tax may 1e pa-i in cash."
