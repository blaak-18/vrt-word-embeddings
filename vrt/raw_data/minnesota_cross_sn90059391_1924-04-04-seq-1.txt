TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
THEY CALLED HIM A FOOL
THE END OF EDUCATION
A DANGEROUS BUSINESS
FOR more than an hour I sat in a
little village store and listened
to an old man as he talked about
life’s problems. The fellow appealed
to me and his words rang so true
that I have neither forgotten the man
nor his utterances, although years
have now passed into the Chambers
of Yesterday. I remember distinctly
that the old man’s neighbors in an
swer to my query said, “Swanson is a
fool, a nut —something gone wrong
upstairs, stranger.” If Swanson was
a fool, I wish there were more men
as “foolish.”
“I’ve traveled some in my life,”
said Swanson, “you know I sailed the
high seas for more than 20 years.”
I noticed that most of the men in
the store paid little attention to the
old man. Some smiled knowingly.
Others acted as if they were bored.
I, however, encouraged the one-time
aailor. , , tm _ .
“I have seen .life in nearly all lati
tudes and practically all longitude.
I have paid some attention to the
ways of people. Well, you know,
things would be different if all of
us knew where we were going. Most
folks sail along without a destination
in mind. What would you think of
a ship-captain roaming the oceans
without steering for a port. That’s
what nearly all people are doing. I m
a living example of a man who sailed
for nowhere in particular for so long
that I nearly wasted my life.
“When I came to these parts, I
settled down on a piece of land that
folks said was worthless. Well, 1 set
right to work to show them around
here that the worthless land was good
for something. For the first time in
my life I had something definite to
go after—l had a goal. You ought to
see my farm, stranger. Water holes
Sid stony acres and hills only made
e job of mine more interesting. I
can get a good price today for ‘Swan
son’s rabbit pasture.’ It pays to know
where you are going. Oh, it s been
lots of fun, this life of mine out here.
I’ve had to study and work and work
and study. Over on my farm Ive got
bees and chickens and ducks and
geese and dogs and cows and pigs and
goats. They all helped me. 1 read
in books about them and went ahead
racing then*.

basket of flowers to Annie, Ole John

flowers nearly as much as I do. I get
a lot of pleasure from my flowers
’cause they drive folks’ tears away.
Yes, I have a good time out here liv
ing and knowing why 1 worrked.”
IF EDUCATION does not, as a
general proposition, bring a
greater amount of human hap
piness than a lack of it, such ed
ucation has not stood the test of
the touchstone. Whatever aim
of education the reader may de
cide as the best, let him make
the acid test. The goal of all
education must be human happi
ness, otherwise there are grave
dangers ahead. It does not mat
ter so much what chart is used,
so long as the objective is
reached without unnecessary de
lay and suffering. Remember
that the end of education is not
mere bolts or locomotives, but a
greater amount of happiness.
Neither is it the aim of education
to make an individual a better
“scrapper” in a dog-and-cat strug
gle for wealth. We have said to
our young folks, “get a good edu
cation so that you can pull the
man who hasn’t your education
down from the rung that he has
gained.” This has created in our
economic adjustment a “knife
sticking” competition. Is that
education for human happiness?
Is the individual who has won in
the “battle of claws” happy?

INTERMARRIAGE
QUESTION IS UP
IN MINNESOTA
White Girl Wants to Marry
Negro Boy, She Tells
Writer
ADVISED A G A I N S T IT
Real Negroes As Much Against
Intermixing of Races As
. White People
(Korean of Publtratlon and Kdueatlon)
WASHINGTON. D. C., March 26.
The Cloverleaf American, published
in St. Paul, Minn.esota, in its 1 issue
of March 15 carries an article that
makes a red-blooded American shud
der. It is under the caption, “In Ldve
With Colored Boy” and is printed un
der the departmenal head of “Prob
lems of Our Subscribers.” It certain
ly is a local problem for the Minne
sota Fiery Cross to solve, and perhaps
rescue, if possible, a young white
girl who is just at the age when she
needs guidance and protection.
The. story starts with a question as
follows: (Q) “I am white and seven
teen, and am going with a colored
boy. I love him and have lots of
money and "'e are going to get mar
ried soon. I don’t want to marry a
white boy. Is if all right?
WHITE GIRL.”
Here is the answer the publication
gave: (A)* “It most certainly is not
all right. The races should not in
.er-marry. You are far too young to
take a step like this. At least wait
until you are twenty, and I think you
will find this ‘love affair’ has passed
away. And before you marry into the
colored race, ask yourself the aues
tion whether or not you wish to have
colored children.”
The person who sent the writer this
clipping made the comment: “And
many people wondar why Vhe Klan?”
There you arc. IJ Whar» one of the
very problems the Klan has taken up.
For tnese two young people to mar
ry is to violate one of God’s laws and
the law of man himself. It is a
crime against nature itself. There
should be no mixture of the races and
the racial blood.
Not only the white people but the
best colored people themselves are
against this thing. Such noted edu
cators as Booker T. Washington, one
of the greatest colored men of a gen
eration, stood out against intermar
riage between the races. He knew it
was wrong and undertook to teach
his people of the folly of violating
what ought to be a sacred law.
Let’s take a southern view of this
matter, down where the negro is bet
ter known and more understood.
Down south, the white people and
the colored people both agree that
they have more respect for the real
black negro than they do the yellow
or mixed blooded negro. * Both races
trust the real black man much more
readily than they do the yellow man,
because they know they can trust
him, while there is doubt about the
yellow negro. The latter has white
blood in his veins, and he somehow
gets it into his head that he is just a
little better than either a white man
or a negro and he conducts himself
accordingly.
TRUE PASTOR SHOULD AWAKEN NEW
NEEDS WITHIN HIS PARISHIONERS
The preacher’s duty toward his
parishioners and his way of carrying
out his task was the subject of the
morning sermon delivered by the
Rev. W. T. McElveen at Plymouth
Congregational church. St. Paul, yes
terday.
“The preacher’s duty is not to make
his parishioners satisfied with him,
hut rather to make them dissatisfied
with themselves. He preaches less
to supply their mental and moral
needs than to awaken new needs
within them.
“The true teacher rejoices in the
inquisitiveness of his pupils. The
savage’s desires are very few. The
wise, we are knocking the props from
under the government “of the peo
ple. by the people, and for the peo
ple.” Where we have cla*s conscious
ness we liave class hatred: and where
we have class hatred we have class
struggles. Class hatred breeds mis
understanding, suspicion, and Intoler
ance between classes. Class struggle
wastes without reason, widens the
gulf between the antagonists beyond
the possibilities of conrlllatoin, and
brings misery In super-abundance
where the Innocent sutler with the
guilty. We say It loud and high.
“THE PUBLIC SCHOOL RURAL

cation In America! It would be a
national calamity If our schools went
astray now.

Passionate Patriotism

Radicals Do Not Control Organi

dent Charges
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., March 25.
A kind of passionate patriotism iz
the prevailing characteristic of Amer
ican clubwomen, and whatever they
do for the betterment of conditions
in America is along constructive and
not destructive lines, Mrs. T. G. Win
ter, president of the General Federa
tion of Women’s Club.; said in an
swer to an unsigned aiticle published
recently in tne Deaiocrn Indepen
dent.
The letter was entitled, “Are Wom
en’s Clubs Used by Bolshevists?” It
charged among other things that
“leadership in women’s clubs has fal
len into the bunds of radicals to an
alarming extent.”
“I suppose there is no group in the
United btates that is more thorough
ly loyal to the ideals and practices of
Americanism than just these women’s
clubs,” Mrs. Winter said in part.
“The mass of members and officers
of women’s clubs are of the distinct -
ly conservative type. ;
Will Not Be “Red”'
“They are the wives and mothers
and grandmothers of America. They
have borne the ordinary burdens of
life. That fact alone is sufficient to
answer the accusation. The ordinary
wives and mothers of America are not
in uanger of becoming ‘red,’ nor are
they choosing officers who violate
iheir own standards.
“Of course it is possible that among
2.800.000 women one could, with a
fine tooth comb, find a few reds, but
if such could be discovered it hardly
would be worth a headline. It also
is possible that ra ical groups would
like to make an inread among us.
They would have a very hard time in
making even a dent.
“The general federation has few
requirements for membership, hut
among those few is the requirement
that there shall be nothing in the
club constitution that is contrary to
the constitution of the United States.
For Army urn! Navy
“As a matter of policy, the general

should maintain an army and a navy
adequate to preserve the security and
dignity of tne country; such dignity
and security being themselves a great

Mrs. Winter adds that if the author
of this article is confident of his or
her position, would it not have been
a matter of evident integrity that his
or her name should have been signed?
Anonymous accusations are on the
level of anonymous letters, she said.
Gopher University
Now Engaged in
Producing Movies
MINNEAPOLIS. MINN., March 23.
- From studies to the movies is not
a far jump* for most student at the
University of Minnesota.
But it might be thought a far jump
from academic complacency if the
university itself were to enter the
moving picture business.
Nevertheless, that is just what has
happened. In the last two years,
since the business really “got on its
feet," »the extension division at the
university has sent thousands of films
to hundreds of little communities all
through Minnesota and even through
out the middle west. Up to July last
year 183.000 persons had seen these
films, W. T. Wilt, assistant head of
the lecture and lyceum department,
said last night. The first six months
since that time have shown an in
crease in attendance of 60,000.
“The idea at first was to collect a
group of films on pedagogical sub
jects for distribution thruoghout the
state,” Mr. Wilt said. “That was four
years ago. Now the scope inludes ed
ucational films of all kinds, including
a very fine group of Minnesota
scenes.”
There are films which take the
audience through a watch factory,
films showing how Minnesota builds
good roads, films tracing the story of
ihe telephone films of infinite vari
ety, ready for distribution two weeks
after they are requested.
"The other day a request came in
for a film showing the life history of
sulphuric acid," Mr. Wilt caid. ‘We
furnished it."

Ole O. Sageng, tona fide dirt farm

state senator from his county, has

Minnesota. The state primary, com

banner of nomination.

one of the oldest families in that
country, were in St. Paul recently,
the guests of Mrs. D. R. Salisbury,

which has taken Count and Countess
Abe through Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The visitors went from St. Paul to

“The nation is sick,” the Imperial
Wizard declared. “It need 9 medicine,

leader’s talk.
Dr. Evans declared in a humorous
vein that he was getting high toned,
