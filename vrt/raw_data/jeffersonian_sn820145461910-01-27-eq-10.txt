OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
WHAT DID IT BEAR?
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little Georgia boy to join your happy
band. My grandpapa takes The Jef
fersonian, and I enjoy* reading the
letters from the little boys and girls
very much. I am eleven years old.
My birthday will be the Bth of July.
1 am going to school all I can. lam
in the fourth grade. My mamma is
a farmer. She raises cotton, corn,
peas, pinders, potatoes and sugar
cane. I help mamma on the farm.
I have one sister; there are three in
the family. My papa died in March,
1903, and my grandpapa died Jan
uary 1, 1910. Little Jewel Owens’
riddle was a broom. Daddy Jim,
come down and see us. We live
down here in the flatwoods of old
Tatnall, where ’most everybody likes
Tom Watson. We are grinding cane,
and we will give you a good time
sure. We live about seven miles
from Reidsville, the county seat. I
will give you a riddle: There was an
apple tree over on yonder hill; last
year it bore apples; this year it bore
the same kind of fruit, but didn’t
bear apples. Well, this is my first
letter. I will close with best wishes
to The Jeffersonian.— John Lee, Rt.
1, Manassas, Ga.
MORE RIDDLES.
My Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes
a little Georgia girl, ten years old.
1 received my post-card, and was
very glad to get it. It is cold up
here now; I think w T e are going to
have some snow. I think the Post-
Card Club is one of the greatest
things yon could publish in your pa
per. As I didn’t describe myself the
last time, I will now. I have blue
eyes, brown hair, fair complexion,
and am four and a half feet high;
weigh seventy pounds. I will ask some
riddles: What is it that is some
times open, sometimes shut, some
times dry and sometimes wet; long
legs, short thighs, bald headed and
no eyes? Answering Jewel Owens’
riddle, it is a broom. My papa takes
both of the Jeffersonians. I hope to
see my letter in print. Best wishes
for Daddy Jim.—Your little friend,
Sarah Ponder, Forsyth, Ga.
A POST-CARD FOR ANSWERS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
girl, twelve years of age. My papa
takes The Jeffersonian, and I like to
read Daddy Jim’s page. I am going
to school every day I can. I am in
the fifth grade and like my studies.
My papa is a farmer; he raises cot
ton, corn, potatoes, and sugar cane.
I help papa on the farm. I hdve
thiee sisters and one brother; there
are seven in the family. We have
forty pupils in our school. My teach
ers are my brother and Miss Olive
Chambliss. I will answer Miss
Jewel Owens’ riddle: it is a broom.
Let me ask you some riddles: What
is it that goes to the grass but never
eats, goes to the branch but never
drinks? To every one who answers
this I will send you a pretty post
card. Well, this is my first time. I
will close, with best wishes to the
Jeffersonians.— Flossie Jackson, Rt.
3, Thomaston, Ga.
WHAT’S YOUR ADDRESS?
Dear Daddy Jim:—l received your
post-card, and I think it is nice. Papa
thinks Mr. Watson is a great man and
he hopes he will live to see him Presi
dent. I would like to exchange postals
with the little readers. I think the
answer to Jewel Owens’ riddle is a
broom or shoes. I would like to
give a riddle for the readers to
guess: Why is a mouse like grass?
To all that answer this I will send a
card. Old Santa brought me a
necklace and sweater, and lots of
other things. Well, this is all for
this time. With best wishes to The
Jeffersonian, I remain, your little
friend, Wilna Rose, age nine.
Ghe Jeffersonian
A HARD RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
girl, thirteen years of age. My papa
takes The Jeffersonian, and he thinks
it is a great paper. I enjoy reading
the children’s page. I noticed some
riddles in last week’s paper that
Bascom House was asking. I think
I can answer them. No. 1: It runs
all day and never gets tired, and
stands under the bed at night with
its tongue out, —is a shoe. No. 2:
As I went over a heeple steeple I
met a heap of people, nicker, nacker;
some the color of brown tobacco, —
is a wasp. And one riddle that
Jewel Owens asks is a broom. Let
me ask you a riddle: A white fowl,
featherless, sat upon a king’s house;
out ran Lord Lolly, shot, him down
boldly, roasted him fireless, ate him
mouth less. To the one who answers
this riddle I will send a post-card.—
Sincerely yours, Willie Hutcheson,
Rt. 3, Temple, Ga. .
ANOTHER FROM TEXAS.
My Dear Daddy Jim:—Can you
move around and give space in your
happy band for a little Texas girl
twelve years old? I have read many
letters from little boys and girls in
different places, but have not seen
any from Stephensville, Texas. I live
in the country and go to school; am
in the seventh grade, and like my
teacher. Papa takes both Jeffer
sonians, and reads them from page
to page; thinks they are the best
papers ever published. Papa thinks
Mr. Watson a great man. Mamma
says he has converted her on For
eign Missions and Socialism. Well,
I will close and come again before
long.—Your true friend (for we all
think there is no one like Mr. Wat
son), Luna Primrose, Route No. 4,
Stephensville, Texas.
YOU CAN HANG ME.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Lam coming
again, as I have not written you a
letter in some time. Thought I would
let you know how I am getting along.
Our house was burned up Monday
night, between twelve and one
o’clock. We don’t know how the
house caught on fire, unless the fire
in the kitchen rolled down. Nearly
everything w T e had was burned. We
have some insurance. The answers
to Glen Rose’s riddles are: Ist, a
shoe; 2d, aunts. The answer to
Jewel Owens’ riddle is a cat. Who
can answer this: I stand on love;
love stands on me; if you can un
riddle this, you can hang me. An
swer this, and get a post-card.—Your
true friend, Gertrude Gober, East
Point, Ga.
A RIDDLE READER.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little black-eyed girl, with fair com
plexion and black hair. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian. I like to read the
children’s page. I go to school
every day I can; am in the fifth
grade. My teacher’s name is Mrs.
Lonnie Hooks; I like her very much.
I am a little girl ten years old, my

ber. My father is a farmer, and
raises cotton, corn, potatoes and
wheat. I will answer Jewel Owens’
riddle: a broom.—Yours truly, Mat
tie Bell Phillips, Rt. 2, Avera, Ga.
NO ADDRESS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
newcomer to your paper, for I am
only three years old, will be four next
August. My oldest sister is writing
for me, but I tell her what to write.
I help mamma while my sisters are
at school; carry in the wdod for her.
I would like to exchange postals
with the little girls and boys. Well,
I must close, with much love to
Daddy Jim and best wishes to the
readers, I am your little friend,
Juanita Rose. (What is your address?
It was not on your letter.)
TOM WATSON AND MIKE.
Dear Mr. Watson. —I am a little
country boy, eight years old. My
papa takes The Jeffersonian, and
.likes it very much. I go to school.
My teacher’s name is Mr. Guy Beall.
1 have tw*o sisters, Kate and Mary,
and one brother named Thomas Wat
son. My papa is a farmer; he raises
cotton, corn, potatoes and peas. Papa
has a mule, his name is Mike. I can
ride him anywhere I want to. I have
one little calf. I saw some riddles.
in the last paper, so I will give one:
Black upon black, and black upon
brown, three legs up and six down.
Well, as this is my first attempt to
write, I will close.—Good-bye, Glenn
Denton, Rt. 5, Douglasville, Ga.
LIKES THE JEFFS.

tle country girl. My papa takes The
Jeffersonian and the Magazine, and
I like to read them very much. I
have one sister and one brother, and
I am twelve years old. I go to

think the riddle of Jewel Owens is a
broom. And the riddle of little Glen
Rose is a shoe, and the other is a
swarm of bees. I will close, with
best wishes.—Your little friend,
Cordelia Winn, Royston, Ga., Rt. 2.
MORE BROOMS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come, as
my other letter was not in print.
Papa takes The Jeffersonian, and I
like to read the letters from the boys
and girls. I live in town, and like
it very much. I go to school. My
teacher’s name is Miss Lula Peek. I
will answer the riddle that Miss
Jewel Owens asked: It is a broom.. —
Lee Ray, Bowman, Ga.
After
La Grippe
“I had suffered several weeks
with LaGrippe. Had pains in
my head and -eyes. It felt as
though there was a heavy weight
on the top of my head, until it
seemed that my brain would
burst. I was so nervous that
I could not rest or sleep. When
I dozed off I would awake with
a sudden jerking of my whole z
body. Dr. Miles’ Nervine, Heart
Remedy and Nerve and Liver
Pills cured me. A number of
friends have since realized the
same benefits.”
MRS. ALVIN H. LOCKS,
Seabrook, N. H.
The after effects of LaGrippe
are often more serious than the
disease, as it leaves the system
in a weakened condition that
invites more serious troubles,
such as pneumonia, etc.
Dr. Miles’
Restorative Nervine
should be taken for some time
to thoroughly restore nerve
strength.
Dr. Miles’ Nervine is sold by all drug*
gists. If the first bottle does not benefit,
your druggist will return your money.
