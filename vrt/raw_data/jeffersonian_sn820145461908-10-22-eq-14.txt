66 per cent of the value thereof in
currency.
Third—The government shall issue
on such collateral currency to the
amount of not to exceed 66 per cent
of the value thereof.
If the “interest” on such loan
were to be:
To the bank—2 per cent, it would
have a margin of 6 per cent of earn
ings with which to provide the nec
essary “sinking fund” for the re
demption of his collateral.
To the bank —2 per cent, it would
have a margin of 2 per cent on the
loan with which to guarantee to the
government (in addition to the
pledge of the capital of the bank) the
ultimate payment of the loan.
To the government there would be,
taking the figures given as to value
of investments and annual transac
tions, 2 per cent on 66 per cent of
$247,655,000,000, or for the issue of
a currency of $165,103,000,000, an
annual income of $3,302,060,000.
And behind this “currency” would
be every dollar of collateral in such
condition that it could be COLLECT
ED; a condition utterly and abso
lutely impossible under the best gov
ernment bond ever issued.
Moreover, the “cornering” of a
currency issue CANNOT be prevent
ed other than by making that issue
of such size that it adequately repre
sents the needs of every dollar of col
lateral existent.

THE RAZOR-BACK—PLANS AND
SPECIFICATIONS.
In Texas they have the razor-back
hog. He is made up of Swiss
cottage architecture. The highest
peak of his corrugated back is six
inches above his tail. His tail hangs
like a dishrag from a back window.
He leaves the impression of a man
starting late to his office in the morn
ing. He lives on roots and peanuts.
He will help his neighbor gather the
crop by crawling under the fence at
night. Crossing him with blue blood
gives little improvement. The only
effective way to cross him is with a
railroad train. He can hide himself
in a hay stack where the hay knife
has been rammed in and pulled out.
His side meat is sometimes used for
window glass. He is imperishable
and can be used for a posthole dig
ger.—F. D. Coburn, address to Knife
and Fork Club.
How She Got It.
A little girl was sent by her mother
to the grocery store with a jug for
a quart of vinegar.
“But, mamma,” said the little one,
“I can’t say that word!”
“But you must try,” said the
mother, “for I must have vinegar,
and there’s no one else to send.”
So the little girl went with the jug,
and, as she reached the counter of
the store, she pulled the cork out of
the jug with a pop, swung the jug on
the counter with a thud, and said to
the astonished clerk:
“There! Smell of that and give me
a quart!”—Mother’s Magazine.

Dr. Durham’s, Liver Medicine
A purely vegetable medicine-useful in all condi
tions arising from a deranged liver-indigestion,
Biliousness, Constipation, Dyspepsia, Sick
Headache, etc., made according to the
formula of Dr. Durham.
The Doctor Durhams for three generations have been the leading physicians of
Georgia tn the matter of vegetable medicinal preparations. This remedy Is, there
fore, the result of the continuous and best study of three generations of the same
family.
Its action Is thorough, but without gripes, pains, sickness, or weakness, and Is
wholly free from those objections so common to many of the simply laxative
remedies—acting not only as a laxative, but actually upon the liver. A trial will
thoroughly convince one of Its efficiency in all liver troubles.
Here is what the Hon. Thbs. E. Watson, of Georgia, says of this remedy:
“Thomson, Georgia, March 4, 1908.
“This is to certify that I was formerly a great sufferer from sluggish actions
of liver. I was completely cured by Dr. Durham’s Liver Regulator, and do not -
now have to use any kind of liver medicine.”
