The Sating of Annie Cameron
By 'Robert C. V. Myers.
Snodgrass laughed so loudly that
his mother in the kitchen drop
ped a dish. His laughter was caused
by the decision that Annie Cameron
should be saved ; that she should mar
ry Sam Bolton;
This idea had first presented itself
to him, two nights before, when little
Jim had another of his attacks and
Annie couldn’t get to the Mission
where she tried to go a little while
every evening. This morning when
the decision had been reached, Snod
grass clenched his teeth and brought
bis fist down on the table. His moth
er bustled in with the breakfast. Re
curring to the thud she said:
4 4 Flanagan’s fallen downstairs
again,” the gentleman in the adjoin
ing flat having a habit of using the
stairs in that fashion. Snodgrass did
not enlighten her as to the truth. His
mother going to the kitchen again, he
freed himself of a deep groan.
‘‘Flanagan’s whipping the children
for leaving their toys on the stairs
against the landlord’s orders,” his
mother called in to him; and again
Snodgrass failed to lift an aspersion
from his neighbor’s character. When
his mother came in once more she
said, noticing his uneasy manner:
11 It’s plain to see you’ve got a
holiday and don’t know how to pass
the time. How do you like this cof
fee 1 Did you know Flanagan’s got
an accident policy 1 ?”
“Mother,” Snodgrass said irrele
vantly, 44 little Jim Cameron’s sick
again. ’ ’
“It’s always been that way,” his
mother replied. “They say he takes
up so much of* Annie’s time th'at the
dressmaker says she’ll have to get
somebody else if Annie don’t turn out
more button-holes in a week. I pity
that girl. She took care of her moth
er till the last, and here’s her brother
ailing all the time. The doctor says
he may be that way till he’s seven, so
she’s got two more years of it. I
don’t know how Annie’s going to
manage; it’s killing her by inches.
She ought to get married. You know
-Sam Bolton’s mother says Sam would
give his two eyes for her, only Annie
holds him off. I suppose you know
Sam’s uncle, the contractor, is going
to get him into polities?”
Snodgrass was in a sort of reverie
in which a becurled little head, bloom
ing above a black frock, was mixed
up with a man whose mother averred
would give his two eyes for her, while
care of a tiny brother was “killing
her by inches.”
Breakfast over he went down to the
was not the girl to thrust a sick broth-
He might as well own it to himself
that he was fond of Annie and had
been so for a long time, though he had
fought down any expression of the
feeling, as every one he knew im
pressed it upon him that Sam Bolton
was her choice. Sam, by his own ac
count, was making big money and was
going into politics which would give
him further ascendency. And it was
no wonder Annie held him off, she
was not the girl to thrust a sick broh
er on a husband.
* 4 But maybe Sam don’t see how
pale and thin she is, ’’ he said; 11 they
say politics kind of blinds you to a
good deal.”
Suddenly he stopped short. Sup
pose he should go and interview Sam?
He was near the campaign club, in
the doorway of which Sam usually
held forth when he had any time to
himself and informed his friends as
to the manner in which the city ought
to be governed.
~As he expected, Sam was there and
in a brand-new suit; in his cravat a
pin which, had it been of the dia
monds it represented itself to be,
might have paid off considerable of
the national debt. Snodgrass was not
dressed up, and on the instant he ap
preciated the independence which is
the adjunct of decent raiment.
44 He110, Bob!” Sam sang out ge
nially, and flipped the ash from the
cigar hie was smoking.
44 He110, yourself!” feebly respond
ed Snodgrass, and could think of noth
ing else to say. The two or three men
who had been with Sam dissolved in
the vista of the club-house hall.
“Seen anything of Annie Cameron
lately?” asked Sam, making the very
opening desired. “She’s so taken up
with that kid brother of hers that
I’m disgusted.”
Sam,” said Snodgrass, “what do
you think of the kid anyway?”
44 N0 time for him,” answered Sam,
biting the end of his cigar viciously.
44 Sony for Annie, though. If she’d
take my advice—well, she knows what
I’m all the time telling her, and that
is to give him to the Society, or some
thing.”
Snodgrass thought they must be
very intimate indeed when Sam could
give Annie advice 44 a1l the time” as
to little Jim. As for himself, he never
should have presumed to offer her ad
vice; rather, he agreed with her, tell
ing her that he understood how dear
the kid was to her, and that sort of
thing.
“I wouldn’t,” said Sam explosive
ly, 4 4 have the care of a sick kid not
if I was Andy Carnegie and Jim was
a jay library. I saw him and Annie
a few minutes ago. Kiddy’s had an
other spell, and Annie was breaking
her back carrying him.”
Snodgrass regarded him vividly.
This man professed to care for An
nie, and yet he could loiter at hiis
club while she was 4 4 breaking her
back” carrying a sick brother.
44 She’s making a fool of herself,”
Bolton went on hotly. 4 4 The idea
of her going to the Mission every
night and taking the kid there on
Sundays makes me tired. 'She even
gets the Gospel crank, little iSimp
son, to pray for Jim. I’ll show her
a trick worth t\?o of them; if she’s
ever my wife.”
4 4 Sam, ’ ’ stammered Snodgrass
hastily, 44 if Annie got rid of Jim
would you marry her?”
44 Today!” answered Bolton, 44to
day ! ’ ’
Then it was not Annie who was
holding off, but Bolton on account of
Jim! Snodgrass saw away out of
the difficulty. He was acquainted
with an old lady who had been a
nurse and who, for five dollars a
week, would look after Jimmy as she
3effersoulati
looked after a couple of other delicate
children, and Annie might be happy
with a home and protection.
“Where will you be about four
this afternoon?” he asked the club
man.
44 About here,” answered Sam care
lessly. 44 My uncle’s coming this
afternoon—Ah, there’s a fellow I
want to see,” and he darted into the
club-house.
There was one thought in Snod
grass’ mind as he went down the
street —Annie must be saved. Sam
Bolton had said that he would marry
her today if she were free of Jim.
Yes, she must be saved.
There were arrangements to make
—he must see little Simpson, Annie,
the old lady who would look after
Jim, and this afternoon he could go
to Sam and tell him Annie was ready
for him. Though he must spring it
suddenly on Annie, give her no
chance to back out. Her curly head
rose before him, her brown eyes
looking wistfully into his as they had
looking wistfully into his as they
so often had done.
First, he went to the Mission. Lit
tle Simpson was diminutive, Snod
grass was tall. He looked down at
little Simpson, and little Simpson
looked up at him.
“I suppose you could spare a few
minutes at four this afternoon?”
Snodgrass asked sententiously.
4 4 Who’s dead?” inquired little
Simpson, who was used to funerals.
“Dead nothing,” crisped Snod
grass. 44 It’s a marriage. I suppose
you know Miss Annie Cameron?”
“So she is the bride,” smiled little
Simpson. 4 4 Strange she did not men
tion it last evening.”
“I’m doing the mentioning,” re
torted Snodgrass. 44 But she’s the
one. ”
4 4 And as true a woman as ever I
saw,” said little Simpson.
Snodgrass seized the man’s hand
and wrung it.
44 You know where she lives then,”
he said. 44 8e on hand at four sharp
this afternoon.”
Without giving the clergyman a
chance to say another word he hur
ried away. He had engaged the
minister, and now he must tell Annie
she was going to be married, maybe
getting Jim away before the cere
mony.
In going to Annie’s flat he had to
pass by his own. The temptation
came to him to put on his best suit
of clothes, letting Annie not note
any disparity between his appear
ance and that of Sam Bolton. His
mother was getting dinner ready, so
he had, to sit down to the meal. He
was silent and preoccupied, till his
mother told him that the Flanagan
children had sent the landlord on
his back because of their toys on the
stairs, in consequence of which Flan
agan had received notice to vacate his
rooms.
“Mother,” he broke in confusedly,
4 4 suppose a daughter-in-law took
those rooms so near yours, how would
you like it?”
“The sooner the better, Bob,” his

Financi&l Depressions
Periodical financial depressions distress
the country. We call them inevitable; are
they? Is there no cure? Is not the debtor
—many simply in panic to pay the creditor
—few?
The Remedy
is given in “Usury; from a Scriptural, Eth
ical and Economic Standpoint/’ in which
great book, for the first time in years, logic,
religion, theory and practice are so united
as to demonstrate convincingly that
Usury
is the cause of our recent and every finan
cial distress. The author, Rev. J. C. Elli
ott, strikes heavy blows on present systems.
Interest is the curse of business morality
and business practice.
