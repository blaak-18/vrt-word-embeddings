establishments where we have now
got one?
Why should we do that for hea
then children at all? As long as
we have unfortunate members of our
own household, who die like flies in
the crowded tenements along the sti
fling alleys of our big cities, and
who even perish for lack of the prop
er food, clothing and attention
among the poorer districts of our
rural communities, why should we
go away from home to do such work?
I have no doubt whatever that
your daughter, like, the hundreds of
her sisters throughout the land, is
perfectly sincere in her conviction
that her best lifework can be done
in that foreign field; but, my dear
sir, I can not bring myself to the be
lief that Christ ever meant when He
said, “Go ye and preach!’’ that our
girls should educate themselves to
go abroad and give music lessons
to the heathen. I don’t believe that
Christ meant that w r e should send
first-class doctors and first-class sur
f
geons, to amputate limbs, mix pills
and dole out quinine and other med
icine to the heathen throughout the
world. I don’t believe that Paul and
Peter would ever have sanctioned
this modern innovation (not yet a
century old), which offers such a
temptation to the missionary himself,
as a salary w T hich is equivalent to
three or four thousand dollars of our
money applied to our uses in this
country; and which is so profitable
to the missionary that he enjoys
what very few of us have ever been
able to attain, to wit: a luxurious
home for the winter and a beautiful
mountain resort home for the sum
mer. 1 don’t believe that Christ ever
meant that we should bribe the
*
heathen by offering them such
temptation that the poorer classes of
foreigners simply can not resist it.
We go to a destitute Chinese or
Hindoo and say to them, in effect:
“Christianity will give you all the
medicine you need, all the medical
and surgical attention you need; will
give you food if you are hungry,
will give you clothing if you are
naked; will give you refuge in the
way of a home to live in, will support
you there in comfort; will take your
child to the orphan asylum and keep
it from the perils of the world until
we can marry off your daughter or
get your son profitable employment;
we will put your deaf and dumb and
blind in the asylums; we will take
care of your sick people in the hos
pitals; we will board the youths and
the maidens at the boarding-schools;

we will give them a complete educa
tion, starting at the kindergarten and
rounding off with the finishing col
lege; we will not only give them a
secular literary education, but a first
class musical education. If you will
simply call yourselves Christians, we
will not only supply the whole of
your material and mental wants, but
we will hire you at better wages than
you can earn anywhere else in this
country, if you will go abroad doing
missionary work among your own
people.”
That is the way we talk to the
man of Macedonia. No wonder he
cries to us, “Come over and help us.”
He likes all the good things we carry
to “Macedonia.” He wants more and
more. And he is getting it. The
missionaries are hustling now for
$200,000,000 to spend for “the man
of Macedonia”—for themselves.
“Come over and help us! And don’t
forget the medicine and clothing, and
food, and music teachers, and school
teachers, the doctor, the surgeon, and
the money. Be sure to remember
about the money!” That’s what “the
man of Macedonia” means, in Korea,
in China, in Japan, in Hindustan.
ATy dear Mr. , how can the
destitute classes of foreign lands re
sist such tempting offers? Did Christ
win us to Him by making any such /
offers? Did you and I join the church
on account of any such induce
ments? How- shocked would any
community in this country be, if evan
gelists should come among our peo
ple and propose to do for them —if
they would call themselves Christians
—exactly what the missionaries pro
pose to do for the heathen, if the
heathen will abandon his gods and
come to our God? From my view
point, we crucify Christ afresh when
we degrade His religion in this way.
If the missionaries of Buddha,
Confucius and Mahomet should come
among our destitute people, millions
of whom are actually suffering all the
time for lack of a sufficiency of the
necessaries of life, and
the very proposition which our mis
sionaries make in Oriental countries,
these heralds from abroad would
gain ten “converts,” where Christian
missionaries take one Mohammedan
from Mahomet, one Chinaman from
Confucius, or one Hindoo from
Buddha.
I am perfectly conscientious in say
ing that I don’t believe there has
ever been a sincere Chinese, Japanese
or Hindoo converted. My opinion is
that if we withdrew the subsidies,
we would lose the hypocrites. At
Blje Jeffersonian
any rate, IT IS NOT A FAIR TEST
OF CHRISTIANITY TO SEDUCE
THE PAGAN FROM HIS OWN RE
LIGION BY TEMPTING HIM IN A
WAY THAT HE CAN NOT RESIST.
The missionaries refer, time and
again, to the ten thousand martyrs
that were killed in the Boxer rebel
lion. Now, my dear sir, would you
like to know the facts about those
“martyrs?” They were just about
as truly worthy of the name of mar
tyr as those Koreans were who were
the victims of the Quelpart massacre.
The Catholic priests had, by hook
or crook, secured from the Korean
authorities an exemption from taxa
tion for the Catholics. Then they
went to the overtaxed Koreans and
tempted them by saying, “A conces
sion has been granted to the Cath
olics exempting them from taxation;
if you confess the Catholic faith, you
will escape taxation.” Great num
bers of the Koreans —an utterly
worthless people—jumped at the bait.
The multitudes of apostates became so
great that the Koreans who remained
true to their government and na
tional faith were wrought up to a
point of ungovernable-rage against
these men. They regarded the Ko
rean Catholics with the feelings that
Americans during the Revolutionary
War had for Benedict Arnold. A
mob arose and furiously assailed
these hypocrites, who had escaped
their share of the national burden
of taxation by professing to be Cath
olics. They were not given any
chance to return to the faith of their
fathers. The true Korean didn’t
want them to return to the faith of
their fathers; the true Korean hated
them so bitterly that they simply
meant to kill them. They did not
believe that such recreants were fit
to live. The massacre ensued and, of
course, the Catholics consider the vic
tims of that massacre “martyrs” to
the faith. They were not martyrs to
the faith at all, for they had no
chance to recant and get back to the
positions they had deserted. Their
own people scorned to have them
come back.
Now, it was the same w r ay in the
Boxer rebellion. The Catholic priests
had secured from the Chinese gov
ernment, by reason of pressure put
upon it by France, a concession even
more monstrous than that which the
Catholics had secured in Korea. The
priests were given exclusive jurisdic
tion over Catholic “converts.” The
Chinese government could not pun
ish. the Christian criminal for any of
fence whatever, if he were willing to
run into the Catholic church, profess
ing himself to be a convert. This
very naturally led to an intolerable
state of affairs. Think wffiat it would
be in our own country, if a Buddhist
missionary secured from our govern
ment a concession like that. Why,
if the Buddhist temple which is do
ing business in Boston could secure
a concession like that from the State
of Massachusetts, they would have to
build Buddhist temples all over that
State. The criminals would fly to
the Buddhist faith as a city of refuge,
to escape deserved punishment. That
is precisely what Chinese criminals
were doing in China. Consequently,
the patriotic Chinese began to feel
the greatest indignation against the
foreign missionaries—calling them
“foreign devils” —and the most fe
rocious and implacable hatred of
those Chinese hypocrites who, to es
cape the jurisdiction of the Chinese
courts, had proclaimed themselves
“Christians.” The Boxer rebellion
sprang from this very condition.
The Boxers retributively slaughtered
those hypocrites and criminals. The
Boxers detested them, and savagely
refused to allow them a chance to re
cant, and regain the position they
had deserted. It is an insult to the
memory of Stephen, and every mar
tyr from that early day down to St.
Bartholomew, the Albigensian cru
sade, the Waldensian butcheries, and
the Smithfield fires, to compare these
real martyrs with these contemptible
Chinese hypocrites, traitors and apos
tates, who ran into the Christian
ranks because of what they got out
of their abandonment of their old
faith.
I write you thus at length because
your letter represents so truly the
state of mind into which our people
have drifted. I, myself, did not
know the real condition abroad, un
til within the last few months; and
I am still learning something every
few days. It is my earnest hope that
by the continued presentation of the
facts, and the continued contrasting
of the Pauline methods -with that
which now prevails, I shall have the
intense satisfaction of seeing that
there will be a gradual inclination to
abandon the system WHICH MAKES
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY ANY
SATISFACTORY' TEST TO THE
SINCERITY OF THE ALLEGED
“CONVERTS.”
