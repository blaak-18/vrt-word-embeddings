hazing that the faculty
had adopted. The University is
placed in an embarrassing predica
ment, from which it might better
be relieved. It is commendable in
that it has sought to put down haz
ing, but so far as upper classmen
are concerned, at least, their instincts
may be correct. Mature students—
young men and young women—who
are receiving the benefits of a state
institution, should not need to sign
a pledge against hazing, any more
than they should against stealing,
forgery, arson, murder or any other
crime or misdemeanor. And the
states should enact drastic laws
against hazing.
If the time for action had not
come before, it assuredly has now ar
rived, if the following facts be true:
Cranston, R. 1., Sept. 17.—As the
result of hazing by upper classmen
at the Edgwood high school, Max
well Harrison, 14-y ear-old son of
Rev. Zachariah Harrison, pastor of
the Second Free Baptist church, a
freshman in the school, is so serious
ly injured that he is not expected to
live.
From the story of young Harrison,
it appears that Tuesday night he was
waylaid by a dozen hazers, who
dragged him to the intrance of the
air box of the school furnace and
shoved him in bodily. He fell about
eight feet, and as he fitted tightly
inside the shaft, he was unable to
climb out.
/
Although suffering severe pains
from the injuries caused by his fall,
he crawled and wormed himself
through the long, dark air tunnel,
which passed under the floor of the
basement, only to find himself final
ly up against the grate of the burn
ing furnace. Being unable to turn
around in the confined space, he suf
fered terribly from the heat, until
the hazers finally were able to rescue
him.
Outside any school or college,
grown or half-grown boys would pay
the penalty of such revolting crime
and cruelty to the full extent of the
law. If a band of young “newsies”,
for instance, who perhaps had never
known any refining influences, were
guilty of roasting a mate to death,
or tying him on a railroad track
where his anguished father found
him, cut to pieces, or doing any other
thing of like barbarity, would they
get off with a reprimand and the
half-admiring adage that “boys will
be boys?” No! Fortunately the
street arabs, and the boys who are
not being sent to college by fond pa
rents, but who must dig out an ed
ucation for themselves in the hard
school of experience, are not doing
these things. It is the pampered
pets who must add the zest of tor
ture to their other “larks.”
After a boy has had the prelim
inary education necessary for him to
enter these higher institutions, he is
not to be excused for “hazing.” It
matters not that “he didn’t think.”
What are our state-supported schools
doing that they don’t make the pupils
think of the consequences the victim
of hazing must suffer? Why do they
not make them know that they are
criminals and cowards of the worst
class if overwhelming numbers set
upon one and abuse him?
Making hazing, of any sort any
where, a penal offense, the extent of
the punishment to be in definite pro
portion to the harm done, would stop
the practice. Parents, guardians and
primary school teachers would soon
put themselves behind the movement
to stop it, instead of leaving it a
mere matter of college discipline,
and colleges being confronted with
student “strikes” when they attempt
to enforce a regulation against it.

A Call to Workers.
We strongly urge every one of our
friends, subscribers and correspond
ents, and particularly our active
agents, in every community, to call
together as many Jeffersonians as
possible, and at the earliest date.
Don’t waste any time about it. Do
it right now, just as soon as you
have finished reading this notice. Fix
a date for meeting; hold the meet
ing, and organize, if there are only
Jeffersonian
six people present. Let each of
them sign the pledge, and go to work
right away to secure new members.
Don’t wait for anyone else to make
the first move. If you want it well
done, and done quickly, do it your
self. Rapid movement is an essen
tial of victory.
A SUPREME NECESSITY.
Here we have tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, of men who
believe in certain principles, certain
fundamentals of government. They
believe in government by the peo
ple, a pure democracy. They are in
telligent, and know what they are
longing and hoping for. But they
are helpless—helpless as children,
because they are unorganized, with
out cohesion, without laws, without
a leader. Opposed to these unarmed
people, are the well-drilled, uni
formed ranks of Capitalism, en
trenched behind the defenses thrown
up by the old parties. The people
must be organized. It is a vital, a
supreme necessity.
The Will of the People.
In the Jeffersonian organization,
the people are no longer the follow
ers of a party, but the masters. If
your leaders don’t serve you well,
you can recall them. You can make
and unmake platforms, parties, Con
gressmen and Presidents. Other
parties offer you platforms ready
made, and leaders whom you must
follow. What voice have you?
What right to speak? Cast your
vote as the party boss tells you,
and forever hold your peace. The
Jeffersonians offer you freedom from
party bosses, and party machinery.
Your platform will be the People’s
Platform, and your leader will be
the People’s Leader.
LET’S HAVE A NEW PARTY IN
GEORGIA.
I have watched the trend of polit
ical affairs in Georgia for several
years, and especially for the last four
years. Have believed for some time
that we needed two political parties
in Georgia. The negro stood in the
way, and that was impossible; and,
too, men could not part company
with the dear old Democratic party.
“What’s the use,” they would say,
“since our interests are all the
same.”
That may have been true at one
time, but things have changed now.
We have great industrial plants in
Georgia working thousands of men,
women and children. The interests
of the capitalists and laborers are
not the same. The interests of capi
tal say keep wages low, work long
hours in filthy factories and shops,
which impairs the health of the la
borers; let corporations alone to run
rife with the public at their will, in
order that capitalists may make
more money.
The interests of labor say: Enact
laws making a working day 8 to 10
hours long so the laborers will have
some time for recreation and self
improvement socially, intellectually,
and morally; to force sanitary con
ditions in factories and shops to in
sure good health to the worker by
passing laws requiring same and
appointing inspectors to see that they
are enforced; to raise the money by
taxation for supporting a good free
public school system throughout the
state; enforce the child-labor law —
strengthen it if necessary—and pass
a law compelling children of school
age to attend school; regulate the
corporations so that the cost of liv
ing will be comparable with the
remuneration for labor. This means,
too, the acquiring of public utilities
by municipalities as far as practica
ble.
These are a few questions that
should be paramount with the peo
ple, but are kept in the background
by partisan politicians.
Now, since the negro has been dis
franchised, why can’t we have two
political parties in Georgia? We cer
tainly need them; and here let me
call every working man’s attention,
who may read this, to those North
ern States that are divided political
ly. They have better laws guaran
teeing the rights of working men in
every respect; they set by statute
the number of hours, or fix the max
imum number of hours worked in
factory and shop, thereby prevent
ing the working of twelve to four
teen hours a day as we laborers do
in Georgia. The chances to recover
damages for injuries received while
at work are far better in those states
than in our politically one-sided
states of the South.
Mr. Watson has been calling for
the support of all reformers to help
start another party, and I desire to
ask working men to set to work and
organize among themselves and do
what is in their power to get anoth
er strong political party in Georgia.
It is to our interest to do so, and it
seems the time is now ripe for action
while the Democratic party is split
and fighting within itself. The Joe
Brown and Hoke Smith factions are
fighting each other as bitterly as if
they were separate and distinct
parties. We have a Joe Brown gov
ernor and a Hoke Smith legislature,
each fighting the other and the peo
ple’s interests are lost sight of en
tirely—and of course nothing else
could be expected from such a con
dition of affairs.
Again, I ask all working men to
consider the benefits to be derived
by them from a new party, and then
agitate the question among them
selves and organize local committees
or clubs for the purpose of starting
the movement. I should like to see
the views of working men expressed
in the Jeffersonian on this subject.
It does not appear to me that w r e
may expect anything from the Re
publican party in Georgia; but let’s
have two parties in Georgia, and
then working men may expect some
benefit from one or the other.
