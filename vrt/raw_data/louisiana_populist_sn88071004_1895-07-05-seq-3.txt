tehool Exhibition.
The elosing exercise5s of the Sunnv
-Side schooul took place on June "9th.
in the forll of an exhibftion.
When quite a large crowd had a.sem
bhti in front of the spac·ious rostrumI
which had been erected for the occa
sion : the exercises were opened with
a welcome song by the school, after
which there were several recitations.
dialogues, pantomimes and tableaux.
The negro dialogue by Master Ernest
Jones and Miss IDaisy Guiton, also (;Gyp
sie's Warning by Messrs. Edward
Payne. Ernest Jones and Misses Mary
Anders and Sallie Crow, deserve spe
cial mention. They were well execu- tO0
ted. and showed excellent training and
skill on the part of their energetic. hi
beantiful and accomplished, young
- teacher. Miss Lena Payne. g
In the absence of Mr. S. Y Henry.
(Superintendent of Etducation of this
SIparish) Mr. J. W. Jones was called on
to present the medals.
After a few very appropriate and in
teresting remarks, medals were award- 4
ed Master Walter Lestage and Miss
Mary Anders. for attendance, and to
Master Ernest Jones and Miss Zoe
Hicks, for deportment.
When the exercises were over, it was
announced that refreshments would be.
i, sold in doors.
t Very soon the crowd was seen wend
a ing their way toward the building CO
where quite a saumptuous repast was
spread.
, The proceeds which amounted to
more than $20, will be used for improv
ing the school house and premises.
Dancing was indulged in on the ros
trum till a late hour, furnishing amuse- -
ment for those who engaged in such,
while the more sedate ones were chat- qt
ting and looking on. Withal, it was an th
enjoyable event, so much so that time s
seemed to move on most rapid wings, ri
II for when some of us reached our homes,
we found that we were breaking the

Having purchased the entire stock of E. J. Gamble,

Williams, Weaver & O'Quin,

question or make it secondary to t
the money question. But I don't i
see that we single taxers have any c
right to find fault with them for
being one-idead, for we have com
mitted the same sin ourselves. We I
always were narrow. We could
see no evil but land monopoly and I
no remedy but our hobby-single
tax, single-tax.
Since I have been for the last
two years studying Populist prin
ciples I see that they are broader
in their views, far more radical in
doctrine and more aggressive in
their warfare against legalized ini
quity than their brother reformers,
the followers of Henry George. I
have been for years connected with
one of the ablest single-tax leagues
in this country, one that I consider
representatije of the movement,
and judging from it I have come
to the conclusion that single-taxers
have forgotten what the word radi
cal means.
While I still have an abounding
faith in the noble doctrines taught
in "Progress and Poverty," I have
not only lost faith in, but have
come to feel nothing but contempt
for the plan of campaign adopted
to carry these doctrines into prac
tice. Obedient to that plan, think
ing that he who wrote the inspired
, of my economic bible,
and Poverty," would
also be a wise and competent politi
cal leader, I have committed the
egregious folly, for which I can
never forgive myself, of voting
the wooed time for Grover Cleve
I land for preident, but bitter ex
mp, tauagt me,. at last,
tat even Hmry Geormg is not in
f fallible, and tha he made a colos
a ,al mistake whenm he maIhalled his
Sfollowes nudehr the hden atie
, banmer. Wbea I aisider the sa
d prmen folly f a set of msa elliq
themselves radical reformers, ty
ing themselves to the effete, decav
ed leadership of democratic poli
ticians, I conclude that if our ene
mies, the land monopolists, had
planned the whole thing they could
not have hit upon a better plan to
kill the single-tax movement.
Now while I see no cause for
contention between Populists and
single-taxers, 1 do see great need
for a mutual better understanding
between the two. It seems to me.
for instance, that a single-taxer
could easily have framed a hettor
land plank than the one in the
Omaha platform, for which service
the Populists would repay him by
teaching him that a radical is one
who wages relentless, aggressive
warfare against the existing order.
In all I have said not the slight
est reflection upon the honest in
tention of HJenry George is intend
ed but I believe that the time has
fully come when honest, patriotic,
often-deceived men and women
should cease to make Idols of any
political leader and should demand
instead that their leaders be not
only pure, but they must also be
aggressive and courageous.
