THE OLD GUARDS RALLY TO THE
CALL.
Brother B. F. Arnold’s roll-call of
the “Old Guard” has brought forth
such a shower of letters, of varying
length, that The Jeffersonian, with
its limited space, can not do more
than give the names of those who
have come forward to say that they
are standing just where they have
always been, —on the firing line:
F. S. Taylor, Walnut Springs,
Texas.
R. T. Short, Texas.
A. A. Beal, Anniston, Alabama.
S. A. Black, 409 Pierre street,
Manhattan, Kansas.
T. T. Mattox, Hope, Arkansas,
W. W. Crawford, Wynnewood, Ok
lahoma.
L. L. Adams, Harling, Texas.
N. A. Crum, California, Missouri.
E. W. Mcßrayer, R. F. D. No. 2,
Arkadelphia, Arkansas.
E. F. Talley, Carthage, Missouri.
M. M. Pease, Richville, Missouri.
WHY DOES WATSON REFUSE TO
MEET ELLIS?
Dear Mr. Watson:—l write to ask
you one question. Please answer in
The Jeffersonian next week.
Why do you refuse to meet Mr.
Ellis, of Philadelphia, on Foreign
Mission debates?
I think it is a shame for them to go
off and buy negro children and edu
cate them, when there are poor little
orphan children in our own country
that are without food and clothes
today that need it worse than those
black Africans do. It is a shame
to our own country. You ought to
meet that little man from Philadel
phia and show him that he is in the
wrong road?. Doesn’t the Bible say
that all the world has been civilized?
I think everybody ought to provide
for themselves before providing for
others.
I wish very great success in your
work.
Yours truly,
Babcock, Ga. H. H. WELLS.
Answer.
There are several reasons why I re
fuse to meet Ellis.
(1) If I should consent to debate
with so negligible a quantity as
Epochical Ellis, I could not consist
ently refuse to meet all challengers.
And to meet every Tom, Dick and
Harry who might bob up and dare
me to meet him, would simply ruin
my business. To edit two periodi
cals, build two books at the same
time, and keep up with my enor
mous correspondence, keeps me at
work all the time. To leave home a
single day, means loss.
(2) If I had agreed to a debate
with Ellis, or Bro. Lengee Brough
ton, all interest would have centered
on the conflict between me and them.
Foreign Missions would have be
come secondary. After the debate,
people would have lost sight of the
merits of the question, in wrangling
over the dispute as to who got the
best of the debate. I want to keep
my personality out of it. My pur
pose is, to focus public attention on
the issue.
(3) Such a big question, present
ing so many phases, can not be
treated satisfactorily in a verbal dis
cussion. The manner in which the
Jeffs are handling the question is
yielding results. We are all hunky
dory at this end; it’s the fanatics
that are flying signals of alarm.

HERE’S A CONGRESSMAN WHO
WON’T DESERT; NOR GO TO
SLEEP ON HIS POST,
EITHER.
Dear Mr. Watson: —Just at the
close of the campaign my mother be
came very sick, and this caused me
to neglect all correspondence for
many days.
I want to take this opportunity to
thank you sincerely for your great
kindness and valuable assistance in
my late contest.
I hope that my course in public
life, attended with mistakes as it no
doubt must be, may nevertheless
merit and deserve the approval and
endorsement of those whose confi
dence and favors I have enjoyed.
With great respect, I am
Sincerely yours,
S. S. RODENBURY.
STILL ON THE JOB OF DOING ALL
THAT HE CAN FOR GOVERN
MENTAL REFORMS.
Dear Sir: —I have been confined
to my room for nearly three weeks
with la grippe, but one of my neigh
bors dropped in today, and I pre
sented Watson’s Magazine to him
and he subscribed for it. I have
another party who will subscribe as
soon as I can get out, but I am get
ting up to sixty-eight and haven’t
very much health any more.
Was in the Confederate army four
years, and have been in the reform
work ever since the Grangers start
ed the good work that is beginning
to bear fruit. I have talked and
worked for these reforms that now
seem to be coming our way, but I
have accomplished very little. I wish
we had a hundred editorial writers
such as you are, and a good set of
pushers to get subscribers, until we
could get the people to read some
thing profitable. The people who
most need education today are the
laboring men and the farmers, who
do not read much that is strong, or
that gives them much information.
I want to see another Jackson in
augurated as President, who will dis
band and abolish the so-called na
tional banking system and give us
national banks such as the postal
savings bank, or Government banks
that will be safe.
Your friend,
E. B. LANGHAM.

PROPOSED PLATFORM OF DAN
IEL BRAXTON TURNEY.
Dear Sir:—lf I run for Congress
in the 19th Illinois, my prompting
motive will be the desire under God
to be helpful to the people in hinder
ing the destruction of the remaining
legal tenders, in hindering the central
banking scheme of Aldrich and Can
non and their gang, in hindering the
civic corruption which now ties the
Government up to the reign of graft,
in hindering the agencies which are
rapidly making the United States a
fief of the Vatican, in hindering the
defilement of the temple of civil and
religious liberty through combines
of ambition and intrigue, etc. And
I shall need all the help I can get.
Respectfully,

LIVINGSTON’S RECORD.
Dear Sir: —Now, about L. F. Liv
ingston. Yes, Livingston stood on
the rostrum at Athens, at the Al
liance rally, when Weaver and Simp
son were here, and said that Col.
Ed. Brown had made his speech
with his welcome address as mayor,
but he, Livingston, wanted to take
subscriptions for the Alliance Bible,
which was the living issue. He also
stood on the rostrum at Bishop,
Ga., and cussed national banks? and
cussed the money kings for locking
Jeffersonian.
up the money and paying the in
terest to keep it from circulating.
He told all who were there that all
we needed was a sub-treasury bill,
and to get it, we needed a long peti
tion, with boots on one end and
brains on the other, and he could
fill the bill, and he was elected.
Then he waltzed off with Giddin’s
band, and he came back home and
come to Monroe and made what he
called a Democrat speech. He said
he told the ring in Atlanta if they
would help him to beat Stewart he
would caucus with the Democrats
in Washington when he got- there.
And that same day, in the same
speech, he cussed C. C. Post, and
said he told Post that crowd was
rotten to the core and was black as
hell. And I can face him in all I
am writing. I want you to do all
you can do for his opponent.

SUPPLY OF CONGRESSIONAL
RECORDS IS OUT.
Dear Sir: —In your paper some
time since you advised the people to
read the Congressional Record and
learn which way our Congressmen
vote on each bill.
I have written to Mr. A. S. Clay
for it, but he states the supply is ex
hausted.
I would like to ask you if there is
any other place I can get the Record
or a duplicate? -
I also ask that you answer this
through The Jeffersonian, that others
may know as well as myself.
Yours truly,
W. A. COWAN.

Answer.
You might apply to the Repre
sentative from your district; or to
the other Senator, Hon. A. O. Bacon.
However, the Jeffs mean to keep
you well posted. T. E. W.
VACCINATION—AND SMALLPOX.
Dear Sir:—l read with interest
your editorial, “When the Police Go
Too Far,” in your issue of February
24, 1910.
When you get further acquainted
with the subject of vaccination you
will learn some things that will no
doubt surprise you. If I could find
the time I would be glad to write an
article on it for The Jeffersonian, but
my correspondence is so heavy that
it is difficult for me to attend to any
thing else.
Nobody in Atlanta has been vac
cinated. What has really been done
is that the people have been inoculat
ed with smallpox. Vaccination con
sists of inoculation with the virus of
cowpox, which has nothing to do with
smallpox. The virus generally used
in this country is not derived from
cowpox, but is made by inoculating
cattle with a culture of human small
pox. The result of this practice, which
is merely a modification of the old
time system of smallpox inoculation,
is that smallpox is being spread
throughout the country. I have per-

sonally seen cases of smallpox pro
duced by vaccination, and in every
instance where I have been able to
trace an epidemic to its source I have
found that it started with cases of
varioloid resulting from vaccination.
It requires only the exercise of a lit
tle common sense and a very little
knowledge of biology for one to real
ize that the sowing of smallpox
among the people must necessarily
result in a harvest of smallpox. Cer
tain individuals, with peculiar sus
ceptibility to smallpox, being vacci
nated with virus of variolous origin,
will develop varioloid in a very light
form and will transmit smallpox to
other susceptible persons brought in
contact with them.
Last year one of the leading manu
facturers of vaccine virus lost money
on account of more than fifty per
cent, of his output being returned
and the Government destroying a
large amount of his stock because it
was found to be a culture of foot and
mouth disease. His vaccine farm was
under quarantine for several months
because of the foot and mouth dis
ease. It does not require very much
stretch of the imagination to fancy
that he is now trying to make up his
losses and that the people of Atlanta
have been rendering him welcome
assistance. The sowing of smallpox
