CHRISTMAS MUSINGS.
By Siillie Trueheart Parrish.
HAT would a childhood Christ
mas have been without a
Santa Claus? What would
have been the use to have
0
Christmas if there had been no
Santa Claus?
That happy delusion was the most
wonderful thing in the world to us.
How could Santa Claus go to every
home in one night, even with his al
most hying reindeer! How could he
go so fast! And how could he get up
on top of the house and come down
the chimney? How could he carry
so many presents?
How did he know’ so well just
which stockings belonged to the
girls and w’hich to the boys, and
never make a mistake and put fire-,
crackers in Mary’s stocking and the
doll in Johnny’s? What would he
bring us this year? He brought this
last year, and that the yeai* before.
What would he bring this year?
Would it all be something to eat or
burn, or would there be something
which you could keep? Why
wouldn't he come if you stayed'
awake and watched for him? You
would have been glad to see him and
tell him how much you loved him.
Would Christmas never get here?
It was twenty-four days off yet for
this was the first day of December,
and how slowly the days crept by.
These were questions which we
children often and earnestly discuss
ed each year without reaching any
satisfactory solution.
Sometimes, too, there w’ould come
up in your mind the dreadful possi
bility of there not being anything in
your stocking. They told you that
Santa Claus would not give you any
thing if you were not good, and for
the last three months you had been
trying to be good, but you found it
hard. You forgot one day and box
ed your little brother’s ears when
he made you mad. You pouted be
cause you had to wear the same old
dress to school on Friday. You care
lessly dropped and broke a lighted
lamp and set the house on fire. And
Santa Claus surely knew all this, for,
like God, he knew everything. And
what if he didn’t bring you any
thing! Could you stand it? Would
you ever get over the shame and
mortification of it? You grieved
over your sins. You almost dreaded
to see the longed-for night come.
But it came, at last, and next
morning when you awoke and found
your stocking crammed full you
were so happy and so glad that Santa
Claus had forgiven you until you
felt like it would be easy to always
be good now, and you resolved then
and there to do better next year.
Here’s to Santa Claus. May he
live forever! May his pack be always
full on Christmas Eve! May there
never be an empty stocking hanging
up on Christmas morning!

THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.
By P. J. Campbell.
IFE, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness are among the in
alienable rights guaranteed to
every American citizen by the
E
Declaration of Independence, but be
cause the immortal Jefferson neglect
ed to define these attributes much
confusion has resulted in the fixing
of their status, from generation to
generation.
No great amount of confusion has
ever arisen about the first named
term, life, for however ignorant we
may really be regarding this phe
nomenon, we are not inclined to
wrangle about its demonstration —at
least not on this mundane sphere.
But liberty has always been a bone of
contention. Os all the indefinable
terms that have beset the brains of
man liberty is the most paradoxical.
Liberty for one man usually means
the absence of the same element for
another, so in desperation we say that
one man’s liberty leaves off where
another man’s liberty begins, and
leave the boundary line unmarked.
The pursuit of happiness is a very
comprehensive term, with a scope as
broad as the horizon. The pursuit
of happiness is the intrinsic motive
behind every movement of the race
since the dawm of history; the migra
tions, the conquests, the civilizations
that rose and fell, all reflect varying
forms of this great motive force.
Each race and generation have
pursued happiness in their own in
dividual way, borrowing certain
methods from their neighbors, in
heriting certain forms from their an
cestors, and evolving certain origi
nal processes byway of improve
ments. But with all this wealth of
experience handed down to us by
our forefathers, out of this maze of
methods, the labyrinth of forms, the
profusion of processes, the pursuit
of happiness has never progressed
very far along the trail. The by
ways are so much more plentiful
than the highways, and seemingly
more alluring, that mankind has
been prone to stray away on false
trails which run out in the tall grass
or lead into other paths. At first the
straying pursuer of happiness was
full of hope and strong of purpose,
but when disallusioned about the
destination of his trail, despondency
seizes him and he wanders blindly on
and on, drifting hither and thither
along the winding ways of fate, be
queathing the immortal quest to
those who shall come after.
Undiscouraged youth has ever ac
cepted the pursuit of happiness as a
sacred legacy, and pushed on along
the scattering trail, until lost in its
tangled mazes, the hoary crown of
age settles upon its brown and it
gives place to the new generation,
who take up the elusive trail un
daunted.
Decade after decade we have
watched this procession marching in
a circle, until some of us have con
cluded that happiness is in the pur
suit —that it is to be found by the
way, beneath our feet, perhaps, if
Jeffersonian
Conducted bv Grace Kirkland
we only pause to look for it as we
pass along. But this idea is not
popular. The majority want to find
their happiness in the concrete —they
want it bunched up so that they will
not have to stoop to gather it as they
go along, and because they do not
find the pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow, they die in disappointment.
Some people seek inside them
selves for happiness, and others ig
nore their own existence entirely in
their search. Some try to multiply
their pleasures by artificial stimu
lants and succeed in deadening and
stupefying their sensibilities —sell-
ing their birthright for a mess of
pottage. Some cultivate their appe
tites to excess and reap the antithesis
of the pleasure that they seek. But
very few accept the joy of life,
known to a healthy body and a
healthy mind, attained by co-opera
tion with nature.
To the Pilgrim Fathers, the pur
suit of happiness meant “freedom to
worship God” as they pleased and to
persecute their fellow men as they
chose. In Revolutionary times the
idea was embodied in political inde
pendence. Today the question is as
elusive as ever. Pursued by wealth
and poverty, by those of high and
low estate, happiness still keeps up
the chase with a prospect of holding
out in the race for innumerable gen
erations to come. Through liquor
fumes, and amid wreaths of smoke,
and through a hundred kindred ways,
runs this pursuit of happiness that
lures men on and oil, pausing here
to play the siren, lingering there a
will-o’-the-wisp, taking the unwary
unaware.
Os the great rabble who pursue
happiness, few have paused to take
thought about their equipment for
the chase. The many expect to bag
the game by main force, the ortho
dox expect to lure the prize by fetich
and mysterious charm, the theorist
depends upon formula and the prac
tical upon untiring effort, while the
wise man prepares himself for the
entertainment of the elusive and the
much-pursued, and verily happiness
seeks him out, and dwells with him,
while the blind pursuers stumble on
and on, grumbling at the impotency
of their bait. Most of them die un
wise, but a few, every year, make
the discovery that happiness is not a
thing to be ensnared, that to pursue
happiness for its own sake is useless
and futile, that happiness flees from
those who seek her, but comes un
bidden to those who have uncon
sciously made ready for her recep
tion by good work.
In the madness of the chase, in
the heat of the pursuit, the requisites
of happiness are lost; the keen edge
of our senses,, that delicate adjust
ment that is the natural refinement
of nature, that subtile appreciation
of life that preserves harmony with
the universe, is gone, lost by the way
—spent in an idle quest. In the pur
suit of happiness we lose the capaci
ty, and thus cure oqrselves of the
desire, and the solace of the satiated
is pessimism.
The recipe for success is to reverse
the formula of failure. If we culti
vate our natural faculties for enjoy
ment instead of dissipating them the
order will be reversed. Instead of
being in pursuit of happiness happi
ness w’ill be in pursuit of us. Happi
ness is only pursued by the unwor
thy ; they frighten her away, she
shrinks from their embrace and for
ever eludes their grasp. But the de
serving attract her; human service
has never failed to win her sweetest
smile; W’herever good work is done
she attends, and where kindness is
shown she abides.

NO. 8546—A NEAT WORK APRON.
A large work apron that comes
well over the waist, is indispensable
to the busy housewife. This one, of
white linen, is not only a protection
to the dress, but is neat and attrac
tive as well. The waist is in jumper
effect and broadens out over the
shoulders in a most becoming way.
The skirt is cut circular, fitted in at
the waist by darts. Gingham, per
cale and lawn are all used for the
making. The pattern is cut in three
sizes, small, medium and large. The
medium size requires 4 1-2 yards of
32-inch material.
A pattern of this illustration will
be mailed to any address upon re
ceipt of 10 cents in stamps or silver.
