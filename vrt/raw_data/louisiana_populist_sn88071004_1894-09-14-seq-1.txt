r. Oh, Cleveland, our great politi
r( cal father whose strength can only
be computed by the length and
breadth of the political pie counter
r. whose word is law and whose
r. wrath is like unto the lightning
that striketh the Hills and rip
peth up the Vest of tilofe who
r walk not iu thy ways whose word
is gone out and it will not return
to thee, we worship thy mighty
name, and bow before thee in hum
ble submission. Oh, almighty
father, thou who causeth it to rain
political manna upon the stalwart!
and the mugwump alike; thou who
art not a respector of per,ons but
appointeth a Gresham, or a Mc
t Neigh, or a negro, as thou sepest
e tit; thou who holdeth in the hollow
r of thy hand the fattest offices in
1 the land, and distribute them
whithersoever it pleaseth thee, we
1 come to thee in deep and humble
cofltrition that we may not provoke
tly displeasure. Most adorable
master, our enemies encompass us
rorund about. The mortgage eat
eth up our wheat And cotton; the
railroads take our corn and pork,
and lo! the sheriff gathereth in the
remainder for taxes. Winter holds
us in its icy grasp and the cold
chills trot gleefully up and down
our spinal column. This seems to
be all that our backbone is fit for.
We voted for $1.00 wheat and lo! 40
cents a busbcl stares us in the face.
We voted for 10-cent cotton, and
again we are obhged to drink the
gall of bitterness. Disappoint
ment seems to be the badge of de
mocracy. The seca of democratic
expectation is strewn with the
wreck of disappointment. In vain
do we look for the better times
that to not come. Oh, precious
Cleveland; canat not thou woo
Dame Fortune back, even as thou
didst, woo Maria Halpi,. that she
may smile upona us as thou didst
smile ont Marit. Most adorable
father, our. punishment is greater
than we cap bear. We cry. for
work and there is no work. Our
children ery for bread and there is
nobread. Halp as, oh gtacions fa

"Evidences of Prosperity."
It was "Bill" McKinley who de.
clared a couple of years ago that
"mortgages were an evidence of
prosperity"-and every popginn
Republican orator in the United
Statta repeated the sasertioes -
And now comes the Chicagb
Evening Journal-silperannatefl to I
be sure, but still in the Repnblican
ring--and says:
"Strikes indicate prosperity
among the working classes. La
borling tien, when ground down to
the last degree, are too much dis
heartened and depressed to or
ganize a strike. It is when they
have been receiving good wages,
and have thereby been enabled to
save money, that they are willing
to try conclusions with their em
ployers."

Ed. I'OPULIT.
Dear Sir :-The LoristANA roP
ULIST canme to hand with her home
dress, and its appearance and tone
is highly satisfactory. We feel
satisfied that it will do a great
work, and with the help of lion.
II. L. Brian, you will acconmplish
much good. We see Bro. B. A,.
Bailey of Winn, has been nomina
ted for Congress of the 4th district.
Bro. Bailey was raised in Winn
parish by a widowed mother on the
farm, and is therefore well acquaint
ed with all of the political diseases
that the farmer has to contend with.
lie is a self-made man, and one
that will represent the will of the
peopt,k being a high-toned gentle
man, he will stand nnswervingly
on the People's party platform with
out fear or the hope of favor. And
I will say to the voters of the 4th
congressional district that we must
stand by oar man and do every
thing in our power to elect him, for
all the hope we have is at the hal
lot box, or fight. We wlil never
get any aid from either the Demo
cratic or Republican party, for I
staid with them myself too long to
be further deceived. They don't
wan't the laborer to have any fin
ger in the pie without you are a
ward or parish boss. They want
to dictate and you do the work and
the bosses get the pie. The south
ern part of the State is Democrat
ic by name only. but when they
come to business, they are Repub
licans.
This tariff bill is a farce; it is
money for the manufacturer who is
rnning this government to suit
themselves. If the United States
would open her ports free to the
world, and have free trade and let
the wealth of the nation pay the
expenses of the government and
not the poor consumer, and give us
plenty of money to buy with, our
country would build up, and all
business flourish, and the farmers
would improve their homes, clothe
and educate their children, but if
the policy of. the present adminis
tration shouki continue (which will
be the case, no matter which of the
old parties succeed) it will eoutin
ue to fetch misery and woe to the
laborers and producers. Now in
coclasion, let me say to the voters
of the 4th district: come out like
men and shoulder your part of this
great work, each and every indi
vidual has something to do in
working for this great cause of
"equal rights to all and special fa
vors to none." You may expect to
be called hard names, and for fan
to be poked at you when you de
clare yourself a Populist, take it
all in fun and it won't be long until
you will hear the same men talk
ing reform to you. We want all of
the good people to help to make
this great fliht for liberty. Bead
and study for yourselves and do
your own thinking. Tariff mea
money tbr the manufacturer; boun
ty means money for the sugar re
finery; bonds means money for the
money king, and all of it means
hard times for the farmer. Where
is your part coming in at any how ?
Over production is what we get,
still we cannot support our fami
lies; times never harder for the
farmer than at the present time, for
twenty years the country luhas been
goihg to rack, and we have been
voting the Democratic ticket solid
ly, time r.iU; times are rapiadl
growing wotire: The merebant'Will
soon have judgment on our farms;
examine the docket. of your coarts,
you will find out for yourselve6.
The merchants are in debt, sad the
way things are now going they will
soon be crowded, and of course,
will have to crowd you, aud the
result wi be that all of Our farms
will be absorbed by the greatmon
ey power, and we will be in a worse
Ax than Ireland, to-day. Now is
the time to strike for liberty; we
must not let the noble heritage
bought by the blood of our fore
fathers, slip through our hands
without an effort to save it.
Health of conutry good, corn
fine, cotton not as good as last year.
Eivery body speaks well of the
LO ,UISIANA POP'LIST, may it coin
tinue to do the noble work it has
so ably begun.
Yours Truly,
PLANTER.
Centralization of Goverment
Cleveland a Dictator.
The Santo ('ruz Gulf. some time
ago, declared that: "There is a
powerful tendency at the present
time to subvert the original form
and purpose of our government."
As an indication of what the fu
ture government is intended to be,
if secured, it quotes from the San
Francisco Argonaut, as follows:
"Slowly, but surely, this country
is drifting toward centralization.
State lines will one day be as in
significant as county lines are liow.
States will be lint expressions;
state governors but shadows. In
every state-which will then be a
federal district-there will' be a
federal official, appointed like the
governors of our preset territories.
Behind them will be arrayed the
federal government and the army
of the United States-the pitiless
machine. Bayonets do not think,
ties of local friendship, feelings of
kindred, do not appeal to the
troops of the United States."
How much farther, I ask, must
we travel to se the entire fulfill
ment of the above predictionl Is
a state anything more than a feder- I
al district at the present time, or
its "governor" more than a "shad.
ow?" Are not officiale "appointed"
who override governors and behind
whom "stands the federal govern
ernment and the United States
army?" How much longer will the
American people allow the dicta
tor, Cleveland, to trample all law
and constitution beneath his feet
in his mad rush to build up and de
fend the monopolies of the coun
tryl He regards neither law, jas
tice, the constitution nor his oath
of office. He should now be im
peached, -or by some Cromwell be
baurled without ceremony from his
throne at Washington. The peo
ple should no longer in patience
bear his tyrannous dictation.
Talk of anarchyl The real anar
chists are at Washington at the
head of the government; and they
want to ioerease the standing army
to 400,00 men, they think it will
require at least that number to

and starving millions of them
They expIet us to be law-abiding
'hile they tramlle humaunity ani
uman law under their feet. It is
not only our right, but it is our du
ty, to rebel against despotism that
would crush human rights. They
atre not created by law, nor can
they be suppredssed by law. They
are natural, they are inaltenable,
they pertain to man by virtue ot
his manhood; nothing can be law,
however or by whomsoever enac
ted, that does not protect the elqual
ights of man; all else are merely
espotic decrees iq the form of law,
hat should be defied and trampled
under foot. Governments only ex
lst to protect human rights; they
derive their only just powers fronm
the "consent of the governed."
When they no lontger serve thfbe on

right to exist, they should be abel
ileed uaid new governments should
be established in harmony with jus
tice and human rights.

figures are correct. In about all
the beats whore the vote does not

were given an inspector that ac
counts for the correctness of the
vote. In those beats where the
vote is so largely increased is where
the reform ticket he;uled by Cap

an inspector. In nearly all them
two white men, organized Demo

could not read or write were ap

Weutid's Trade With a Sead
It is told of a printer that he re
cently walked into a certain bust
ness house in his round to know
who desired anything in the way
of advertfsements, and noticed a
drummer, who steed by the coaunt
er, with his sample vrises ready
to open. "Anything you want to
say is the paper this week 1" said
the printer to the business man be
bind the counter. 'o," sadd the
bnsineas ulan, "dou't believe in ad
vertihing." The drummer waited
until he was half way to the door,
then slowly taking up his sample
valise, remarked: "Well that lets
me out. I do not care tosell on
time to any man who, at this age,
does not believe in advertising. 1
prefer to deal with live men.
When I want to strike up a trade
with a deadj matn, I'll go -to the
graveyard and swap bnuslines.
