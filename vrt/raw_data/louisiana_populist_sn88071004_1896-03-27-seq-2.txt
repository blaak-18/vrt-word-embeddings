Our neighbor, the Enterprise.
had lurid editorials in its issues of
two and three weeks ago, alarm
ing the peaceful citizens of our
country with rumors and pictures
of war and bloodshed too dire to
describe.
Our people were severely fright
ened, our women and children were
kept out of public highways and
public places, and doors and gates
were barred of nights-all because
some irresponsible person had
named, without authority, two ne
groes in this town as members of
some worthless committee which
died "abornin."
For two whole issues, our neigh
bor, found ample material to in
flame its broad and otherwise un
interesting pages, without so much
as exciting comment from the nu
merous dailies and weeklies on its
side, all of whom seemed to un
derstand the joke.
But all balloons have their fall,
and all bubbles, however brilliant,
must burst; so "Parson" Blount,
one of the Enterprise's alleged ter
rors, came out last week with a
short letter which effectually punc
tured the wind bag and the fall of
the Enterprise was great, and it
was pitiful toabear the apologetic
wail of said paper last week. Its
whole issue sounded a tone of "I
kicked-before-I-was-spurred," and
our people breathed a great sigh
of relief when they found them
selves free from the great dangers
that had been predicted.
We woukl suggest to our peo
ple to pay less attention to this
false alarmist in the future; hav
ing no issue in this campaign and
backing a ticket that is justly de
spised, the Enterprise will be com
pelled to resort to all sorts of
hoaxes and false alarms in the short
remainder of this campaign.

Government is no longer ad
ministered in Louisiana by the of
ficers elected, but by the executive
committee of the Democratic party.
When a vacancy in one of our
important offices like that of a
Congressman occurs, the duty of our
Governor in ca!lling the election to
till such vacancy is plainly pres
cribed by law as to time, manner,
etc.
But our Governor refers this
important matter to the I)emo
cratic executive committee for
them to say when andt bow it shall
be done, subserving, of course,
t ee best interests of said party re
gardless of the expense to the tax
payers.
And said Democratic committee,
of course, advises that said Con
gressional election be not held
along with the State election, and
that the expense of an extra elec
tion be incurred in the interest of
the Democratic party.

Last week the Governor ap
pointed A. E. Sompayrac to the
Board of Election Supervisors for
this parish. The Police Jury ap
pointed Maj. R. B. Hollingsworth,
vice J. L. Barbee. Clerk H. M.
Hyams, appointed U. P. Brea
zeale vice W. S. Greneaux.
The appointments are good men,
and we hope are made with a view
of continuing the honest elections
we have had in this parish under
the retiring Board.
The law requires the Board to
give the opposing political party
representation at the polls, fail
ing in this, the said opposing par
ty is accorded the right to put an
inspector in the polls to protect its
rights, and it is hardly necessary
to notify the election machinery
that the People's party is strong
enough in this parish to protect
said inspector at every poll, if rep
resentation is denied.
Said People's party has already
been recognized in this parish by
the appointment of its represents
tives in two previous elections, and
the Hewitt dodge, of according
the rights of the opposition to the
negroes will not go, and we warn
our people to be in readiness to
demand and protect their legal
rights if denied them.
Pop lists, Notice.
On account ot Small Pox and
the consequent quarantine's the
Populist candidates and speakers
for both State and local ofices,
have been unable to Ill any of
their appointments in this parish.
Hence it is of the utmost im
portance that all Populist clubs in
the parrish meet on Saturday,
April 4th, at their respective pla
ces of meeting and take charge of
the eampaign at their several pre
eincts, and meet each baturday
thereafter, and be in good working
order, ready to take up any work
assigned to them in reference to
the campaign, appointment of com
missionerrs, watehers of election,
distribution of tickets, ete.
Your work for the last four
years depends for sucess on your
promlt, elfeent and patriotic ac
tio, for the remaining 8 weeks of
the campaign.
Do not fall. -

Judge E. North Cullom, young,
intelligent and honest, denounced
the cry of negro domination as un

Populists can afford to vote for
such a Democrat as ahove describ

The Coushatta Democrat, Foster
organ for Red River, foolishly
discourses thusly :
The constitution is framed by
the people and for t!.e people. We
alone have the power to change or
alter it. Our last Legislature, iam
pelled by the cry for ballot reform
that was at that time sweeping the
State, submitted this proposition
to the people. They are in no way
responsible for it. In fact, the
great majority of them will vote
agaast t. So will the democrats
of this prish vote against the
amendment. When the edncation
al stdard of our people shall be
higher, then it may be time to eon
sider it, but at present we have no
choice left but to joian together and
iseure its defeat. We have too
many good citaems among s who
aen not read and write to advocate
Msuch a measure. Down with the
amadmemt.
The idea that the Democratic
Legislatre which passed this
amendment by a two-thirds vote is
in o way responsible for it, csa
be aconnted for only by admit
ting that they were so eompletely
dominated by Gov. Foster's pie
eonter as to be wholly irrespon
sible for their acts, which is pret
ty near true, for we were an eye
witet.

iatmous merur.
Asnd now they earn with conasist
easy, and without blushing, cry,
"Down with the amedament."
But in doiag so, they cry with
still more ocsisteny, "Down with
the iLamous ballot-bo-etafers
who originated this theft of our
menhood and our liberty."

From Red River Parish.
Polities are getting lively up
here, men in both parties are walk
ing the streets as busy -a bees,
working for their party's interest.
We are encouraged. We can't
help but be, when we see such men
as Simmons Thomas, Alex. Lind
asy and Frank Wren, aligning
themselves with the Populists, de
clring that they are in favor of
free silver and against an English
finanial system.
The Populist party is the place
for you Bro. They demad free
silver ; no other party on the face
of our Globe does. We are in
formed that the Democratsof ward
2 and S in Natchitoches pariah are
holding meetings asking the Popu
list to aree to help keep the ne
gross from voting in the gemeral
election. We are ulso informed
that considerable oratorial disply
is exhibited at these meetings.
Subject: "Negro in the wood
pie." Question: Pops, we refus
ed a white primary, but we want
you to help us keep the negroes
out, for they won't vote for us,
dead sure. I asked Mr. H. T.
Liverman for a white primary, he
hasen't yet informed me that be
would accept.
These Democratic schemers will
gladly count 2000 negro votes or
as may as they can get in DeSoto
parish against our Senatorial tick
et. Yet they are ano willing for
them to vote in Natehitoches parish.
The Coushatta Democrat, that apoe
tie of white supremacy, proudly
boasts of the negroes unanimous
ly endorsing the local Democratic
ticket in DeSoto parish, and says
that it means success to the local
Democratic ticket. No wonder
people quit the old party, if it is
worth, anything its worth quitting.
We would like to be Senator, but
we want it by actual vote and fair
count. If the Democrats will give
as a fair show sad we are defeated,
we can face it bravely.
