pleasure, hie them to Ilnampsten
Heath. If you said "llanupstead
Heath" to one of them. however, he
would look at you as at one putting on
airs. To hit the vernacular and be in
fashion you must say "'Ampetead
'Eath." Then would you be hailed as
a man and brother. if the Americann
wishes to get a perfect view of the
lower class English at their best and
worst, let him by all means take In
llamtpvtend Heathi on bank holiday.
The ht+rth is simply a huge hillside.
with mlore o01 lss grass and a few trees
growing upoln it. A steep street lec:ds
to it out of : great thoroughfare froni
the heart of Ionlonn. .to you walk up
the st'ep street you see at a corner of
the pav:tniemnt. and very close t.,pi con
venient ale and beer house, of coutl.,
stone bearing an inscription. It teili'
you that on the very spot marked by the
stone little orphan I)ick Whittiltton
sat down to rest himself, with his cat
in his arms, when he was running
away from London. and as lie sat
heard the bells of the city .chlmuing
"Turn again. Whittington. thrice
mayor of London." Matter of lact
persons say no mortal cair could have
heard the bells of the Loudon of 1:'80
chim!ng at Ilhmpstead HIeath. Iecause
the town was then so sma ll anlid so f:ir
away, but what would these have?
We cannot spoil a good story.
Millions of feet have since pressed
the spot where weary Dick Whitting
ton and his cat rested that day. and
many thousands press It still every
August bank holiday.
Upper class England stays strictly
away from Hampstead Heath on bank
holiday. That is the very reason for
going there. You want to see the Brit
labh nature with Its stays off. Well. you
see it. It throngs to the heath in a
hundred thousand specimens, on foot.
by omnibus, and by what these swpec
mens call "the tram," which is one of
the two or three electric car lines the
whole city of London boasts. There
are thousands of children with the
prettiest comple-ions of any young
ones in the world. English children
that get enough to eat are' lr,'ttler than
American children, but as they grow
to maturity they lose this beauty, and
then Americans have the advantage ',
looks. Again, an English lower clay,
crowd does not begin to Is' so wea;
dressed as a French one. Its clothing
is not so clean or well made. (;irls'
skirts and shirt waists are inot wehi
joined. Men. even young mten. ailwar
to have come to the pienic in their
working clothes.
Here atop of an omnibus you see a
young fellow and his best girl. She,
though pale faced, like most English
working girls, is neatly dressed and
clean. The unwashed youth who is
with her is evidently a fireman or coal
beaver, hands and face still covered
with black and g'ease. lie has one
dirty arm squeezed tight around the
girl. Moreo er, he is drink. and his
head half lolls over her shoulder. Sihe
does not seem to mind. although she is
clean and sober and looks respectable.
The fact is men are so scarce In Eng
land that when a working girl gets
even a drinking beau she is pIased as
possible, to most of tiher friends have
nose. Any sort of man is better than
no man at all, thinks she.
If an American were to sum up In a
few words his impression of this
Hatmpstead .eath outpouring, it would
be. "Ill bred ill dressed. Ill fed., under
sized and having the prettiest complex'
ions and worst teeth of any white pea
pie I ever saw." It is rare to see
Samong the . )ndon poor even a yonng
persie that .as good teeth. Boys and
gets of 14 run about grinning witt
