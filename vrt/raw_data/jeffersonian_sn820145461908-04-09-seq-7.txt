imental. If a year’s trial shows that it is not
a better plan than the old, the former order
will be restored. So the new plan should be
given a trial, and then those who are most
directly concerned will be able to tell which
they prefer, and their desire in the matter
then will be adopted.
So far all the objection has come from pol
iticians of the aforesaid class and their cla
quers of the press, with only a few expres
sions from pensioners. It is too early for
these latter to express themselves now. It is

That Virginia-Carolina Fertilizers are far superior to any other fertilizers Is /Si /
proved by the experience of Mr. D. M. Griffin, D. D. S. of Plant City, Fla.,
who says: “I was trucking on a small scale, and decided I would try a few W
sacks of your fertilizer, as it was cheap and said to be good. I put it un
der some tomatoes by the side of some other high grade fertilizer which & ''Wif ,
cost me sls a ton more, and in the same proportion per acre. I don’t v'-S/
think I exaggerate in the least in saying that the yield where I used Vgjf
| Virginia-Carolina Fertilizers was three times that of where I used
L the other brand of so-called high-grade fertilizer.” M? /

natural that, when they received only a quar
terly payment at the time when formerly
they had received payment of the entire sum
for the year, some of them should have felt
disappointed. We all do when we get less
money than we had been accustomed td" re
ceiving. But when they shall get the second
third and fourth payments, at times when for
merly they had got nothing, the whole mat
ter may appear in a different light and so
much better that they would most strongly
resist any effort that might be made to re-
adopt the old system.
That the pensioners should be paid quar
terly seems certainly to be the better plan.
Many of them are needy. The little pension
they receive is their chief reliance for money,
To wait for this money a whole year, even if
