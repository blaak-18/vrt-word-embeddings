RAMBLING REMARKS SY THE STORK

week as this has been! Why, I
must have almost doubled the cen
sus ! ’ ’
“How wonderful!” exclaimed his
wife, admiringly. “The President
will be dee-lighted!”
“Well, I am sure he ought to be,”
complacently continued the Stork.
“You see,” he continued, “the chief
was pretty blue about race suicide.
He sent for me and said: ‘Storkie,
my boy, won’t you save us from this
disaster? I know it’s asking a world
of you when you are already about
as busy as you could possibly be, but
—well, I DEPEND on you!’ So I
have been hustling ever since.”
“I think you are shamefully im
posed upon,” observed Mrs. Stork,
with considerable emphasis. “You
get neither vacation nor Sunday;
legal holidays mean nothing to you
and most of your work is at night,
too, when you are liable to come in
contact with all sorts of criminals,
or be yourself mistaken for a burglar
and shot. I’m worried about you
every minute you are away, and I
should like to know why the family
physicians are not required to relieve
you of some of this work?”
“Family physicians!” echoed the
Stork. “Why, my dear, you could
scarcely find one of them left. We
have nothing now but eminent spe
cialists, and small help they are to
me. Still, I wmuld not complain, if
they would only cease tinkering
and tampering with the populace I
am at such pains to provide. No
matter how cunningly I may tuck
away a vermiform appendix, along
will come one of these officious indi
viduals and yank it out, quivering.
If I playfully attempt to diversify
humanity a bit by cross eyes or other
little variations, are these specialists
willing to let things alone? Not
they. Everybody must be reduced to
a dead level of normality. Fortunate
indeed it is that they have nothing
to do with the time and manner of
bringing folk into the world, because
there’s no telling what might happen.
Why, one of these learned doctors
would chloroform people at sixty, if
he had his way!”
“ How unjust that would be to you,
when even now it is difficult to keep
up the population! I hope you have
made a formal protest against it!”
“Hardlv w’orth while. I let him
theorize, while I practice. And T’ll
bet all the babies in Pixieland against
his musty old laboratory, that there’s
more fun and excitement in my pro
fession than in his. For, no matter
how many times I may have visited a
place, there’s just as much stir and
flutter and bustling about as though
1 had never called there before. Very
“DEAR, dear, but
I’m quite fagged
out! ’ ’ sighed the
Stork, as he laid
down the weighing
basket and other
impedimenta of his
office, yawned, and
stretched his wings
before the cozy
hearth. “Such a
naturally, I have some special favor
ites. Tonight, for instance, I drop
ped in, with an extraordinarily fine
boy, to a very shabby little cottage,
hidden away where only myself and
the tax collectors have ever found it,
and my, my, the jollification we all
had over my gift, although it was
the fourteenth time I had left them a
package! To be frank, I had first in
tended to take that boy to a certain
wealthy couple wffio very much de
sired an heir, but the laddie turned
out such a wonderful specimen I de
cided to let my old friends have
him. For great natural beauty will
redeem poverty and patches, while
even an ordinary, plain little child
can be made lovely where riches
•abound. Nevertheless, I am not at
all prejudiced, and where parents
have, fine character, as well as mon
ey, I do not hesitate to trust my
brightest babies to their unbringing.
“ ‘Want the babies?’ 'Sometimes
they do—oftener not, perhaps. Peo
ple would like to treat me very much
as they sometimes do book agents.
Now 7 , if a salesman says: ‘Will you
take this peerless set of Morocco
bound, gilt edged poems for ten
cents?’ the first impulse is always to
say, No, even if one has the dime to
throw away. So, when I say to re
luctant prospective parents: ‘Will
you have this exquisite bundle of im
mortal possibilities, bound in real
skin?’ they usually decline. Then I
retort: ‘All right, take it anyhow!’
Os course they do, and love it, and
enjoy it, and wonder how they ever
managed to exist without it, just as
one would the books, if the agent
simply forced the sale.
“No,” continued the Stork, “I
can’t allow people to interfere much
with my affairs. I can remember per
fectly w’ell when I brought each one
of them over from Pixieland, as red
and ugly and crimpled up as Hindoo
idols —brimful of colic by day and
rampant with habitual insomnia by
night—and it ill becomes them now
to wish to shirk all of the kind of
trouble they once gave their parents.
I am a pretty successful disciplina
rian, and if they are too dow’nright
disagreeable about it, they get —”
“What?” asked Mrs. Stork, in a
frightened whisper.
“Twins!” chuckled the Stork.
“Lately I had just such a case. Lit
tle woman was winsomely human at
heart, but she took herself too se
riously. Then she had aspirations
which she complained her husband
did not sympathize with and ‘finer
feelings’ he could not understand.
That is always the way, my dear,
when a man spoils his wife too much.
He is credited with being a brainless
brute, whereas usually his worst fault
is a vast tolerance of her childish
conceit. With her frothy social life
and his dogged attention to business,
things were not going well. I saw I
was needed, so sent notice I was com
ing. Well, there were tears of vexa
tion and storms of protest on her
part, but finally she calmed down to
more small sewing and fewer liter
ary efforts; and, when at length 1
Jeffersonian
arrived (with a pair like two Bisque
dolls in my basket) you should have
seen the rapture and the joy! But
the delight over the little ones was
as nothing compared to that of the
•parents in each other, for it had real
ly dawned on the little woman that
the plain, ordinary husband who had
simply meant a livelihood before, was
a golden hearted fellow of whose
love she should be glad; and as for
HIS happiness! Well, I can only
say that it made me grateful for my
privilege. To think that that couple
had been married, as the world terms
it, for ever so long, and it was only
through me that their souls could
have met!”
“And they will live happy ever
after, won’t they?” cooed Mrs.
Stork, her romantic side much touch
ed. “Does it always turn out so
beautifully ? ”
“No —o —regretfully admitted
the Stork. “Sometimes I am carried
away by my generous impulses and
perhaps work hardship on the very
ones I want most to benefit. There
was my friend, Latewed, an old
bachelor and a first-rate chap every
way.- I always counted on him doing
the sensible thing, so, when he mar
ried the school-ma’am, I own I was
gratified, for you know how I dislike
to see an elderly man select a mere
doll for a wife. ‘Now,’ thought I,
‘they have been slow in starting out,
but the race is not always to the
swift and the Lateweds are too wor
thy to be embarrassed for lack of
family.’ So, at the greatest trouble
to myself, I matched three of the
prettiest w’ee girls that ever grew in
Pixieland and fetched them over. I
supposed Latewed and his wife would
be in transports of joy—but do you
- think they were ? Why, I never saw
a man shrivel up and shrink so with
in himself, and sneak out the back
way to avoid the inquiring relatives.
It w’as weeks and weeks before he
would face the public at all. As for
Mrs. Latewed, she w’ould range the
infants in a row, just as she former
ly did her classes, and seemed vague
ly to expect they would address
themselves to the intellectual prob
lems of life; and when they tumbled
down in soft little bundles and began
playing with their toes, you could see
she was fairly nonplussed. She would
pick up one, and lay another down, in
a dazed sort of way, and could never
remember whose turn it was for nour
ishment. Even the system of differ
ent ribbons didn’t prevent her giving
the weakliest triplet three baths in
one morning, while the other two
howled from sheer neglect.”
“How dreadful!” shuddered Mrs.
Stork. “Did they survive?”
“Oh, yes, both the parents and
the babies all pulled through, though
I can't honestly say the former have
flourished much since; while the bare
mention of my name frightens them
almost into convulsions!”
“Don’t let that distress yop,
dear,” consoled Mrs. Stork. “You
can’t always know what parents will
be worthy of your efforts!”
“No, certainly not,” assented |he
Stork, “and this working with hu
man material is a heavy trial to my
patience sometimes, the elements are
so perverse. Often, after all my ef
forts to get the babies and to see that
their complexions and traits, to say
nothing of races and nationalities,
harmonize with the families for
whom they are intended, people don’t
seem to appreciate them. At times
I’m actually tempted, instead of
handing down the Montmorency jaw
for generations, or perpetuating the
Cholmondelay nose, just to mix fea
tures awhile, until the public has
some proper realization of the pains
it takes on my part to keep heredi
tary in working order. You would
conclude, my love, that if humanity
were at all sincere in what it pro
fessed, nothing, would be of such ab
sorbing moment as a brand new im
mortal soul! Yet many persons are
so busy with trifles they find no time
for the fundamentals. What with
society, philanthropy, money making
and spending and a host of other con
cerns too vigorously pursued, there
are fathers and mothers who hardly
give a thought to the children I
bring. I feel terribly discour
aged at times, as if the whole scheme
were wrong, somehow, and yet”—
“But do you never make mistakes
yourself, dear?” timidly interrupted
Mrs. Stork. “Os course, I am not a
flit judge, but I have feared you took
too many babies to the slums, and
not quite enough to the comfortable,
well-to-do homes.”
“Maybe that is an error,” reluct
antly replied the Stork. “Yet my
main enemy, Infant Mortality, does
his orst - work among the poor and
ignorant. Consequently, to repair
his ravages, I must take more child
ren into the lanes of poverty.”
“That does not seem quite right,"
persisted Mrs. Stork.
“That criticism has often been
made, my dear, and perhaps there
would be much logic in it if I had
to deal with the lower animals, where
each individual remains about as wel l
off as his fellows. Yet they remain
dumb brutes and where is their in
vention? Their poetry? Their reli
gion? But humanity dips ever a lit
tle deeper into the mysteries of life
and creeps ever a little further to
ward the ideal. All I need do is to
replenish it at the source. And, since
the day that a Babe lay in a manger,
it scarce behooves me to be over
captious as to where I put the little
ones I bring from Pixieland.”
“It’s too complicated for me,”
sighed Mrs. Stork, “and I’m rather
glad we’re just—just poultry.”
“You mean fowl,” corrected the
Stork, grimly “Leave affectation to
the miserable barn-yard creatures
they exhibit at country fairs. But I
must be off again now,” he added,
more kindly, “before the President
has any further paroxysms over the
scarciety of his juvenile fellow citi
zens.” And a moment after kissing
his wife goodbye, the Stork was slow
ly making*’ a dark streak across thQ
