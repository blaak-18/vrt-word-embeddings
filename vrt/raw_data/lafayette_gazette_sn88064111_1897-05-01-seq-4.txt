The May Ladies' Home Journal uniquely
reflects the sentiment and spirit of the
Spring. "'In An Old-Fashioned Garden"
fairly emits the season's fragrant flavor, as
do other contributions in plose and verse.
lion. John Russel Young recalls the nota
ble incidents-fetes, receptions and page
ants, etc.-of General Grant's memorable
tour of the word, and ex-President Harrison
gives highly interesting glimpses of the
President's home and home life in an article
on "The I)omestic Side of the White
House"--the iconcluding one of his admira
ble series. Edward W. Bok editorially
presents the really practical side of crusade
against the slaughter of birds for their
plumage, and forcibly protests against the
pernicious habit of spitting in public places.
A reminiscent article by Mrs. Raymond
Maude, '"My Mother as I Recall Her,"
gives some delightful glimpses of the per
sonal side of Jenny Lind, especially of her
home life.
Herbert D. \Vard's serial, "The Burglar
Who Moved Paradise," reaches its conclu
sion, maintaining its quaint humor to the
end. Also in the lighter vein are a remark
ably well-drawn character sketch, "Old
Gabe Carter's Company," and the second
of "The Colonel and Me" papers. Dwight
L. Moody, in his bible Class Lesson, writes
on "Faith" with characteristic directness.
lcsie'les Mrs. S. T. koret's nmost helpful
. articles on cooking and her solution of
puzzling household problems, are valuable
papers on "Traveling with Children in.
Summer," ",Unique Moderate Cost Out
ings," "'Girls' Letters," summer gowns,
- waists, bodices and parasols, "'The Wild
- Garden and IRockery," and many others
brimful of practical wisdom. In brief, the
May Journal contemplates directly and
d practically every feature of home life, and
s appeals to every member of the household.
