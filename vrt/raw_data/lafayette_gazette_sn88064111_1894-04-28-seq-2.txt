Nr . BLANCJIARD.
SNewtoui C. Blanchard was
.United States Senator by
Foster, - his appointment
' the general approbation of
pgecrate and his election for
 the term of the Hon,
~ teo considered certain,
t as tbq'j for the election of
e two' United States Senators, by
the.General Assembly approached,
A.U a spring shower on seeds that
ive ,-been laying in the ground
--wimsg a drouth, it has caused the
ie;ed of ambition to germinate and
-sprout in the bosom of many
- politicia'ns.
The Bible says that "anger resteth
bosom of fools." Perhaps
} here been politicians when the
book was gotten up, it would
have said "ambition resteth in the
-bosom of politicians" Now, wedo
not wish to be understood as finding
fault with those who ambition distinc
tion, by attaining office at the hands
cf their fellow citizens. Ambition
is inherent in human nature; the
farmer, the mechanic, the merchant,
the professional man, the student,
each has his ambiton, and it is right
that it should be so, because ambi
tion is the impeller of progress, in
agriculture,. in commerce, in the
mechanical arts, in science and in
one word, in every thing that embel
lishes this world and contributes to
-the comfort of the great human
family; but what is reprehensible
and what we deprecate is that some
people to gratify their ambition often
forget the precept: ,"Devise not a
lie against thy brother, neither do
ilbe same to thy friend." New ton
C-. 1anchard has been in Congress
eight 'nsecutive years; during all
this ti e, no one found aught to
say aginst his acts or votes; he has
to his party and he has
pseven h' if a zealous, able and
tE.hful. a ocate and defender of
t*i .interest. f his state; it is only
lately, wher, e infamous McKinley
t ty biy as dragged to the
slaughter h to b decapitated
r Democratic tariff
essary revenues
ditures. of the
, . jlanchard has
been denounced by the beneficiaries
of the sugar bounty. They have
denounced him as being un
friendly to this great industry of
our State, because he has voted for
the tariff bill known as the Wilson
bill. We say that this accusation
against Mr. Blanchard is unfair and
not founded on truth. It is well
known that when this bill came up
before the House of Representatives,
Mr. Blanchard voted for an amend
ment to put sugar on the dutiable
list of imported products and that
he advocated a duty of one cent
and a half on foreign sugar as being
the best and easiest way of raising
the necessary revenues needed to
cover the deficiency in the treasury
and defray the expenditures, of the
Government, and at the same time
protect incidentally that industry.
That vote, no one can deny, was
strictly in comformity with the long
established principles and methods
of the Democraric party to raise
revenues and at the same time pro
tect such products, industries and
manufactured goods, of the country
which come in competition with
~greijgr imnprted products and
manufactured goods.
A duty of one cent and a half on
foreign sugars would advance the
irce of home made sugars, in0 pro
portion and would put in the United
States treasury forty five million
dollars and would protect the sugar
growers and manufacturers pro
rasite. Any man, who wants more
ptotection than that, or wants
oiunty or direct protection for the
Sole purpose of protecting his indus
, is not a Demofrat; he wants
lÂ·iss legislation, which means tri
--ute from the toiling masses to '
Uanopolies, -
-' : e t the House refused to put.
on the dutiable list, as the
a .arty had pledged itself
Seople of that monstrosity,
- TtcKiinley bill, and to re- ]
- at.in the interest of the
.some thing had to be
wison bil -'came up
as a party measure.
S being a democrat,
i or rick hitmaself F
l bepreferredt re- a
ie voted ,
- _ - . . .
'ves without fisit' trying to have it
aiamended bysputting a duty of one
and a half cent on foreign imported
sugars and It was only after having
failed in this, that he voted for the
d bill hnder protest," trusting in 'the
- wisdom of the Senate to see that
justice would be done to Louisiana,
as well as to some other States.
Mr. Blanchard is now in the
s Senate, where he will certainly exert
y himself to see that the interests of
t his State are protected as far as it is
f consistent with right and justice.
r Before condemning Mr. Blan
chard, for his vote on the Wilson
bill, we invite those who are so in
Sclined, to read his speech, delivered
I on the 3xst of January, 1894, on
the tariff and his protest against the
t refusal of the House to put a duty
I on sugar. If they do, truth, sincerity
e and love of justice, will protect him
I against the accusation which ambi
v tion and greediness have lately
leveled against him.
i THE LEGISLATURE.
S The approaching session of the
e Legislature will be one of the most
i important ever held in this State.
e The election of Senators to repre
sent us in the upper house of the
Federal Congress is of sufficient im
portance to all Louisianians to make
s the coming session of more than
a ordinary interest. At the present
e time, when the very life of one of
our chief industries seems threatened,
it is the duty of our legislators to lay
t aside personal preference and fac
- tional animosity, and elect for the
1 United States Senate men of courage,
e ability and experience.
n Besides the election of Senators,
- there are vital questions which will
likely come up before our law
makers. The judiciary does not
e seem to give entire satisfaction;
e many are the complaints made and
' objections urged to the present sys
tem. The constitutional commis
sion offered some changes to it, but
judging from opinions advanced by
lawyers and the press, the plan pro
posed by the commission will hardly
be accepted by the Legislataue.
There are the present election
laws. The prevalent opinion
throughout the State is that they
should he remodeled. While in
Lafayette parish elections have
always been absolutely fair, in some
parihes,particularly that of Orleans,
frauds or said to have been com
mitted. The laws should be so
framed as to preclude the possibility
of such dangerous practice; the bal
lot box stuffer should be given no
loophole to escape from where he
belongs-the penitentiary.
If the members of the Legislature
will give their attention to these and
the other needed reforms that will
in all probability be brought up
during the coming session, they will
have their hands full and it will be
impossible for them to spend their
time making political dickers and
running down to New Orleans.
They have the power to do much
good. Let us hope they will exert
it in the right direction.,
The Olympic Club of New
Orleans will now be in a position
to give fights again. The Supreme
Court has decided that the Sullivan
Corbett and other fights in the
Olympic Club had been given
under a State law, passed several
year sago. The case was some time
ago decided for the Club by a
jury and the Supreme court has
rendered on opinion affirming the
decision of the lower court.
Gee whiz ? 14ooo indictments
against Sunday law violators on the
criminal docket in New Orleans.
Allowing three cases per day, it
would take a court over fourteen
years to clear the docket only of
Sunday law cases, without counting
the several thousands new ones that
knight spring up. The Sunday Law
has evidently been a dismal failure.
The report of the Paris Pasteur
Institute for 5893 shows that out of
the 1748 peflons treated for hydro
phobia only six died of that disease.
This is ceatainly a good showing.
Rev. C. A.4Poage of San Eran
cisco has resigned fromx the Pres
bytery. He makes the statement
that no picture of hell will be held
up- to those who may listen to him.
He believes that the erring soul
goes out of existence instead of to
never ending torture. He has made
special studies upon certain script
ural passages and has reached the
conclusion that hell is not neces
sary to the scheme of religion.
San -Francisco has the greatest
proportion of di'orces to marriages
of any city in the world. For every

KA TE MfELD ON THE SUN
DAY LAW.
Kate Field's Washington.
Senator Gallinger has introduced
a bill "to protect the first day of
the week, commonly called Sunday,
as a day of rest and worship in the
District of Columbia" - As this
bill was presented "by request," he
is not responsible for its conception,
which can be readily traced to its
authors. , Is it incumbent upon Con
gressmen to waste time and exasper
ate freemen by presenting bills that
are absolutely unconstitutional?
Ought not the result of their last
attempt to throttle liberty of con
science to suffice as an object lesson
for at least two years? What good
came of attempting to shut up the
World's Fair on Sunday? The law
was defied, and Congress was
slapped in the face, as it ever will
be when fanaticism overrides reason
and demands that we return to the
intolerance of the Puritans.
"Congress shall make no laws re
specting an establishment of religion
or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof," is the very first amend
ment to a Constitution upon which
this Republic is based; yet cranks
in trousers and in petticoats arise
ever and anon to demand now that
God be put into the Constitution
and now that the District of Colum
bia, which is at the mercy of men
who pay taxes elsewhere, shall be
subjected to religious legislation.
Have we no Hebrews among us?
No Second Adventists? No Ag
nostics? So long as public peace
is preserved, what business has Con
gress to mind the business of the
people of the District? Listening
to fanatics, legislators have driven
cabs from their stands on Sunday
against the wishes of both drivers
and public, the latter of whom are
sadly inconvenienced. Pursued to its
logical end this tyranny would stop
horse and cable cars as well? Why
should cabs be more impious than
cars?
Senator Gallinger's Senate bill
x628 has been referred to the Dis
trict Commissioners. In the name
of liberty and the Constitution 'I
protest against a bill .that insults
both. Let the Commissioners
open their Bibles, and turning to
the second chapter and sixteenth
verse of Colossians, read Paul's
excellent advice:
"Let no man therefore judge you
.in meat or drink, or in respect of
an holy day, or of the. new moon,
or of the Sabbath day."
Behold the tolerance of Chris
tianity that its bigoted professors
refuse to follow! Are these bigots
Disciples of Calvin? Then let me
tell them that Calvin would repudi
ate such unworthy followers.
What was his counsel to his stu
dents? "Observe the Sabbath; but
if any man says to you, you must
keep it, then break it as a token of
your Christian liberty.
I commend St. Paul and Calvin
to the attention of the three Com
missioners of the District of Colum
bia.
A Canadian school boy defined
an abstract noun as "the name of
something which has no existence,
as the virtues." That boy has the
making in him of a first class
Louisiana politician.
It seems that "the unknown"
leader of Coxey's commonweal is
named Smith. Now, if it should
turn out that his first name is John
every one will know just who he is.
"'Brother" Gardner has started a
new revival movement in Lowell,
Mass., by borrowing saloons in
which to hold his meetings. The
first was attended by such a trade
revival in the saloon that all the
other barkeepers are now anxious
to secure a turn.
