arrived In sledges at this little town on
the top of the world, are thl first
Americans ever seen in this part of
the czar's empire in winter. Never be

very heart of the sorest spot in the

of Many Lakes.
The party is hea&Ne by t)r. YLouis

collected from benevolent Americans
for the starving of Finland.
He is accompanied by Dr. ! N. Reu
ter of the Helsingfors university, rep
resenting the Finnish central relief
committee; 'Mr. Robert Allopaeus, su
perintendent of the government indus
trial schools, and by the writer. The
party has already traveled over 200)
miles in sledges over frozen lakes and
rivers, from one forest town to anoth
er, sometimes cutting their way
through fields of virgin snow, again
pushing ahead on skees to reach the)
more remote cottages where starvation
lurks. Ten, fifteen and twenty miles
must oftentimes be traveled between
two neighboring cottages. With the
thermometer ever and ever far below
zero and the s"ow gale driven like the,
sands of the desert, it is manifestly
true that such a journey is a test of p
physical endurance and of Job-like pa
tience,
The party carries Its own supply of 1
provisions, an absolute necessity in a 4
section where all the peasantry have
subsisted for months on hunger bread 4
dipped In salt water. Such are the gen
eral facts pertaining to the fur wrapped,1'
fur booted and fur capped party which s
emerged from the forest depths tonight I
after many days spent In driving from
villages where the suffering was bad
indeed to villages where the suffering
was even worse. Kajana, a town of
1,200 souls and the center of the tam.
me iD Finland, Is decidedly an oasis
to this particular relief party, for here
for the time being are a good inn, a
little fresh food and some of the com
forts of civilization.
The first cry of woe from this far
northland was bear around the world.
but no country heeded it so far as
to elicit a response in the form of
proposals for help save America. It
was natural that people in the United
States should be the first to listen at
tentively to Finland's wall of distress,
for toward America flows the great
tide of emigration from Suomi.
The chief divisions of the Finnish
peasantry are the farmers who are
landowners and the tenant farmers.
It Is among the latter that the suffer
ing is most acute. For two weeks we
have visited the homes of tenant farm.
ers, and in every case the sight of mis.
ery and the story of want have been
the same.
It should be explained that we al
ways carried a sledful of bread and
left a number of loaves at each cot
tage. Sometimes we chanced upon
homes wherein the last crumb had been
consumed, the mother and father hay
ing gone forth in search of work. In -f
such instances our loaves came just in
the nick of time. In every stricken of
home also Finnish marks were left
Where they would be found after we
had driven away.
From where I write I can peer to
through a window out upon a scene of to
dazaling whiteness all illumined by the cla
wide spreading flames of the aurora at
borealis. This great torch of heaven
made of a thousand thousand rainbows
reveals to the citizens of IKajana a ut
number of outlying cottages where in- ye
sidious starvation gnaws at the vitals sh
of those within. While the incandes- ov
ce of the northern light imparts a on
ajesty to the scene, assisting the im- ao
agination to grasp the signiflcance of sh
its revelation of the suffering of those on
who hath not, a mournful sound aud- on
denly comeA out of the vast silence.
It is the sound of human voices, male of
voices, singing in unison one of the fat
uaelaocpiy folklore songs of the north. a
The young men of Kajana are serenad
tog the Americans. The young men of bai
Kajana, through the medium of the
national custom, are singing their ea,
thanks to the Whole American nation list
for t e aid givn their people in time a

(Special Correspondence.]
New York. April 20.-No, indeed! The
little ones are not to be left out of the
, list of those who are to have big hate
this season, and the smaller the child
the bigger the hat. Some of them in
tended for children of four and five
years are large enough for umbrellas.
For the very small children hats are
made most often this season of heavy
linen, the brims being formed by the
i wide plaits. Some of the linen hats
it have borders of lace alone Vie folds,
while the front is decorated with an
immense bow of ribbon, generally
d white. The form Is what used to be
called mob shape. The crown is cut
about twice as large as it is *xpected
e to be when finished, and this is then
e gathered to fit the head. There should
be a round of featherbone cord which
is flexible and yet quite strong enough
to keep the hand In shape. The folded
border is to be cut about Fix inches
wide and tour times the circumference
of the size desired on the outside edge.
This is hemmed and the folds laid in
generally in double box plaits. If lace
is to be put on, it should he put on the
brim portion before it is plaited. When
the folds are sewed firmly and meas
ured so that the edge will fit exactly to
the crown, both are to be sewed togeth
er with a deep and solid over and over
seam. This then is to be trimmed off
and bound. The ribbon ann wien be
made into the big double how and set
on in front and twisted around he
back, falling in ends if so desired.

high as $15.
Burnt straw is very suitable Ar
everyday hats, and they are well and
prettily trimmed with a shirring of
louisine ribbon. and b few flowers
around the crown. This styie is for a
girl from. ten to twelve. The shape is
flat and round, so that it can be bent
into almost any form to adapt it to the
face beneath. One has a shirring of the
wide ribbon in a pale frosty blue, and
in spots are small clusters of pink
roses with a vine of leaves the rest of
the way around. A handsome hat for a
girl of from twelve to fifteen had the
round and slightly upturned brim of
blue straw faced with heavy lace, and
the brim had a wreath of life size blue
morning glories all around. In the back
was a many looped bow with drooping
ends. This design was carried out in
flowers of other shades and kinds.
A dress hat for a child of eight er
ten was of white satin braid, with a
flexible and much bent brim, which
had a deep ruffle of lace lying along
the upper side all around. The crown,
which g'as not very high, was com
pletely hidden under a mass of white
daisies, with their foliage. At the back
was a bow of wide satin ribbon, with
ends a quarter of a yard long.

"carriage babies" there are any
amount of dainty hoods and caps. One

soft white material, with many box
folds standing up smartly in front, and
on the outside there is an arrangement
of ruffles of edged lace made very full,
so that the whole is deliciously fluffy.
On the inside of the brim is a quilling
of pink ribbon which reaches out quite
to the edge. This is in turn edged with
narrower ruffle of the lace setting
close to the sweet little face. The
strings match the ribbon facing.
I And that I have room to say a few
words about the dresses for the same
little ones who are to wear the mar
velous headgear. Deep blouses and
short skirts seem to be the rule for all
over and a few under six. The cool
and comfortable little Hubbards are in
rogue for the small ones, and the sailor
shapes are much liked for the older
mnes. Russian blouse suits for street,
with light colors trimmed with lace
aid on as applique, like the garments
)f their mothers, seem to be the most
'ashionable. There are so many mate
'isis suitable for girls that it is not nec
wssry to mention them, but serge, al
satross, heavy natural linens and the
pretty wool volles are all destrable. Of
nurse this does not mention the long
lst of wash goods, and of these there t
s an endless choice. '

vendi provided by the last boundar3
otommission these towns and gumedi
ate adjacent territory are temporarily
held by the United States, but it is eol
only desirable, but necessary, that theli
permanent status should be definitely
defined.
The dispute, so far as they are con
corned, centers on the geographical
classification of the Lynn canal. upon
which they are located. The United
States authorities claim that this se
called canal is a great arm of the sea
and that under the terms of our trea
ties with both Russia and Great Brit
ain the boundary should be thirty
knots inland from its innermost shores.
The Canadian contention k that the
canal is territorial water. th;a the real
coast line runs across its entrance from
headland to headland and that the
boundary should be thirty knots from
this entrance. As Skaguay, at the*ead
of the Lynn canal, is from sixty-five to
seventy miles from the entrance, it
would become a Canadian town 9 this
latter interpretation were allowed.
Nevertheless Canadian vessels Gould
not reach the port without passing
through about thirty miles of Inted
States water.
Both Skaguay and *yea are S atnW
peopled by citizens of the United
States, to which government they are
litensely loyal. *his has been dpm*
onstrated on more than one eccasior.
and more than once this byalty has
come near precipitating a quarrel that
might have led to serious international
complications. They are bitterly op
posed to Lanada and al things Cana
dian, particularly the Canadian con
stabulary and customs officials. they
have felt and suffered under what thqp
call the oppressive mining laws and
customs duties of the Dominion.
When the rich Atlin district. just
across the old boundary line, was dis
covered by Americans, Skaguay had a
"beat" on the strike. The American
citizens of the town hustled across the
White pass and staked out the best
claims. By every sort of mlners' right
and justice, they declared, they owned
these claims. Then came the Canadian
officials and insisted that they must be
come subjects of the British crown or
give up their claims. This In the main
they refused to do and came back to'
Skaguay and devoted their energies to
building up an American town. They
stocked their stores so thoroughly that
much of the valuable outfitting trade of
the interior came to them. They of
fered no end of spending opportunities
to Klondikers who came out with gold
en fortunes. They prospered and be
gan to consider building up a perma
nent city. Then again came the Cana
dians and laid claim to the town, but
the Americans kept on doing business
and making money, though they were
not so eager about the permanency of
the city.
"If the Canadians get Skaguay,"
they declared, "we'll move the city."
And doubtless they would have tried
to do so, as there are plenty of har
bors and town sites on the Lynn canal
In water that is unquestionably Ameri
ran where they could build up an!
American city.
Skaguay stands for an American
Alaska, and every mile of it can possi
bly be secured to the stars and stripes
Its hostility to the union Jack was
shown on two notable occasions.
When the Canadian mounted police
during the second spurt of the rusb$o
