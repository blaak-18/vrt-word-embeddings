Selection of CO ciale.
We take it, tt the majority of
men in our parish who intend voting
the Deroacratic ticket this 'election,
and they rire the large majority of
voters in the parish, propose to do so
upon tle sole -ground of a knowledge,
that Writh Democratic government
comes a return of peace, plenty and
good government-coupled with the
full belief that none will be accept
ed by the Democracy as candidates
for official lwsition, save those who
occupy a stahding, fully known, of
CA:PAWLITY, IOONESTY and CAPACITY
-- three distinctions directly opposite
'to-that of the Itadical. bummers anti
thieves, who have afgected to govern
os for the past eight years, and have
e'eeted the ruin of iutr M)aterial pros
perity.
We say that we consider this feel
ing universal, for should any other
motives actuate us, then it were bet
ter not blazon ourselves to the world
as howling demagogues ; for such odr
conlduct, in face of contrary declara
tions, would stamp us.
A change of rulers brought About
by substituting Democratic teOmape
tents for Radical idiots, would be a
folly so simrlo as to deservedly sub
mit us to ridicule-ridiculo In circles
where we are least desirous of prove
king it; among the honest and the
intelligent. Besides, the object we
have in view, the restoration of an
honest, economical and intelligent
State and local Government, could
never be attained.
Every one must fully understand
that ignorance is ignorance-that
party name does not make compe
tency, and for fear that a fapcied se
curity in a majority of roters any
how, stich security as has lulled some
Conventions. already, may influence
the minds of our parish delegation to
forget their great and bonden duty to
themselves, their people and posteri
ty, we are constrained to make this
appeal, feeling assured it will not
fall unheeded.
Let us not forget the ISSUE. It is
marked and distinct-whether we
are to have honest and capable gov
ernment, managed and controlled by
white intelligence, which can be
brought about by nominations look
ing to fitness alone; or a continuation
of a Carpet-bag-negro-spawn, an nt
tempt at rule that has left traces upon
our State years will not efface-this
last can be continued as well by in
competent Democratic rule as by the
re-election of Radicals. That must
not be lost sight of
We have promised this parish to
the Democracy with a full thousand
majority, but to attain that end there
must be unanimity of action, full
fellowship and family confidence, and
a ticket of capability in etwry way.
Is there a citizen prepared to stand
defeatn Is tlhere a property-owner
prepared fo)r four yeareslonger of Radi
cal rule '
We feel not ; yet, the conduct of
some would lead ns to belieove that
indifference was nianfitlested for re
suits, by the manner in which they
hbandy incompetent names for posi
tions that require brain; rtwain well
organised, well educated, and quick
to tell goodl from evil. We trust, and
know,. now that attention ihas been
calletto it, dOr good eitizen of all
classes will unite in as solid opposition
to a fostering upon is of incapacita
tedDemocratio rule, as they will do
to a continuance of theo unbearable
government of Radical thieves and
negrees.

for the purpo ti '6ct 'organizing secret

Charles visitedo this spOt afad "jplant
U ed" his ideas as instrnetei, in the
e fertile brain of the Radicals, who
straight-way proceeded to piit in
practice their lesson.
The organ of the ta.enders "let
out" in grand style, and ahade a pret
ty kettle of. fish uo the tecret part of
the pirog'tmhie by advising quirt or
ganizations and silent voting, with

Charles Hill advises secret organi
zations, and they attempt it, for it is
an attempt that will signally fail, the
Repubilican advises "quiet meetings
with one or two speeches, and the
sound goes up from the watch-tower,
all's well."
The New Orleans Tinted "fitied out';
Mr. Hill, and imtinediately proceeded
to score him. Hill comes up nied
says the organizations are not scret;
they were published in the New Or

reason the NeW Orleans thieves owit
ceased td eicildtige 'wtil the country

We can certify that Charles Hill
caltle hete, and tlhe fruit of his visit
is made manifest by the utterattees of
