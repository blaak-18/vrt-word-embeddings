WATERLOO.
Philadelphia, Dec. 8, 1903.
My dear Mr. Watson:
Your work in your book on Water
loo is of the highest order. You have
not done heretofore such commanding
and beautiful work. You stand now
with the most distinguished men of
letters, and when men and women of
education know of the book, its circu
lation must be large and your fame
wide. This book is a decoration far
superior to any honor any university
can confer.
Yours truly,
Wharton Barker.
WILL WORK HARDER.
Hiram, Ga.
Gentlemen:
Please find within order for a few
more subscriptions to The Jefferson
ians. I hope Mr. Watson is not feel
ing -discouraged over the late election.
Taking into consideration the - men
who thought Mr. Watson had no
chance and voted for Taft and those
who were rained out gives him a
following of 50,000 at least. On ac
count of the small vote cast, I shall
work harder.
Very truly,
T. W. Clonts.
NEVER VOTED ANYTHING BUT
THE POPULIST TICKET.
Morrow, Clayion Co., Ga.,
November 21, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson:
I want you to hold a conference
and if possible organize our party
for the next four years. lam one of
the old Populists who voted the
Weaver md Fields ticket, and never
voted any other ticket for President
in my life but a Populist ticket.
I have never yet lost faith in my
dear, beloved Tom Watson, and may
the Lord I love and try to serve hold
you up and bless your labors in the
great reform that you have undertak
en. Every reformer in all ages has
had his hardships and his enemies to
work against the good which he wish
es to do his fellowman.
1 would have voted for you if I had
known that my vote was the only one
cast for you in the Union.
In conclusion, allow me to say that
I am a subscriber to your paper and
magazine and love them both and
ever expect to take them, and will do
all I can to increase the circulation of
both.
Your true friend,
J. D. L. Waggoner.
FROM A DEVOTED AND HOPE
FUL CO-WORKER.
Cincinnati, 0., Nov. 22, 1908.
My dear Watson:
I thank you from the bottom of my
heart for the stand you made for re
form when those to whom reform had
been credited have deserted and com
promised with the privileged. The
number of votes cast for the People’s
party denotes that had we placed tick
ets in all the states quite a respecta
ble showing would have been made,
as many Hisgen votes were cast by
Populists; also many voted for Taft.
Here in Ohio the skeleton of the
“Dependence party” was made of
Populists; in Cincinnati, my home, an
ex-secretary of the Ohio People’s
party was a member of the local com
mittee. Three formerly active Pops
were hard at work soliciting signa
tures for Hearst’s party. These men
were very friendly to me and were
pleased to have me make the stand
I did for Populism. Their argument
was, get a large protest vote under
any banner and beat Bryan, for
whom they took MT their coats in
1896. I see that you are not up in
sporting tactics; you have not con
gratulated Taft. Bryan is an all
round sport. He is ready to put on
the mits again. The gate receipts
look well to him.
Yours,
R. H. Reemelin.

KEEP THE VESTAL FIRES BURN
ING.
Musella, Ga. R.F.D. 1, Nov. 19, 1908.
Dear >Sir: And Taft is “trumps”
for the next four years, and several
reasons have been given why Bryan
was defeated, but the best reason I
can give is that the Republicans out
voted the Bryan crowd. It is all
right, I guess, as Bryan had a hand
in digging the ditch for the “Pops”
in 1896.
At my precinct I saw no printed
tickets except what I carried there
of the Watson ticket and the vote
was Watson, 14, and Bryan, 10. A
good many did not go to the polls at
all. One old Democrat of the old
edition said he “did not want to lose
his vote on Tom Watson,” so he put
it in for Bryan —and lost it at last.
I am done voting the Boss-ridden
party ticket. So go ahead and reor
ganize and keep the “vestal fires
burning” as best you can. No more
fusion for me, as in 1896. It looks
a little dark to me to see so many
of the toiling masses holding on to
the old parties and blindly voting
themselves and coming posterity into
servile slavery to the money kings
of Wall Street, and their allies in
America and England. The old par
ty press is in direct line with Wall
Street and the corporations, and this
is the crowd that is fast sucking up
the substance of the people.
Now comes Mr. Osborn and says:
“Let the South withdraw.” Suppose
she does. What then? She tried to
withdraw once and kicked up the big
gest row ever heard of in this coun
try. The banks commenced to feath
er their nests in 1861, and they are
in the saddle toway.
Well, call your conference, reorgan
ize, and put in for better laws and
better money and more of it in active
circulation. “Equal and exact jus
tice to all and special privileges to
none.”
Yours truly,
G. W. White.
