SENATE INVESTIGATORS TAKE
TESTIMONY IN LAND FRAUDS

But Found Neither Obtainable Along Rio Grande.
R. B. Creamer's Attorney Fights to Keep Letters Against Client
From Being Admitted As Evidence in Committee Hearing--Sen
ators Get Telegrams Which Are Incriminating.
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 2 —Some of the evidence in the al
leged frauds in the Rio Grande valley of Texas as put over on the
people by R. B. Creager and others was disclosed before the sen-
ate committee as follows:
John Goosman, of Donna. Texas,
wrote that he had “joined an excur
sion from Kansas City in 1918, had
been treated royally with liquor and
was told of three crops a year in the
Rio Grande valley region, low freight
rates to the gulf and few froasts.”
E. A. Witmer, of Adel, lowa, wrote
that he had been informed by a Rio
Grande valley agent that he could
get “cheap labor and good crops,”
there but had not obtained either.
Adolph Dicke. of Sylvan Grove.
Kansas, who said he had paid $8,530
for Rio Grande valley land, told his
story in his letter: "We landed in
Ebenezer, Texas, and went to McAl
len, and were shown irrigation
pumps, which we later found out were
falsely represented as belonging to
our company. We were not allowed
to mix with the residents then. Later
we had to pay for irrigating the
lands and had to leave them at a
loss. We were told the driktng water
was nearly pure, but found that false.
The land was not as represented to
me. I have given it a fair trial, and
I want to get back my money.”
Big Crops Promised
Under date of May 7, 1918. George
C. and Jennie A. Brownell told of
leaving Watertown, S. D., for Magic
Valley” in the Rio Gdande valley on
an excursion, in which they were
“shown a good time.” “Autos met us
and whirled us through the towns
and went to one show place to an
other. We were shown an alfalfa

were told that frosts were seldom and
light and that there were no snakes,
insects, flies, fleas or ants, and that
the water was the healthiest in the
United States. We signed up on the
return trip. Now we must sell our
corn and hogs to the Mexicans.
Hans Olsen, of Kalamazoo, Mich.,
said he had been taken on an excur
sion to the Rio Grande valley in the
summer of 1919 and shown show
places. “We asked if the land ever
overflows and the answer was ‘Not in
a thousand years except by irriga
tion.’ ” After he purchased, he said,
he found out that the land did over
flow and that it was “ail hills and
holes.”
Correspondence between Olsen and
the Alamo Land & Sugar Company
(Creamer's company), was then intro
duced before the senate committee
to show that the land company was
trying to collect a note from him.
Creager’s attorney fought like a
tiger to keep the above letters from
being read to the committee and go
ing into the Record, but the attor
ney’s objections were overruled.
The same Creager fought to keep
his telegrams from being given to the
committee, telegrams that passed be
tween Creager and his attorney to
land companies down in Texas, but
the committee got the telegrams.
Bribed With Grapefruit
Senator Moses laughingly told the
committee that he guessed he had
been bribed with a box of grapefruit
from the Rio Grande valley. Mr.
Creager spoke up and asked if the
grapefruit was good, to which Mr.
Moses said they were wonderful and
he wanted to thank the donor. Crea
ger didn’t admit that he sent the
fruit, but smiled in appreciation of
what the senator from New Hamp
shire had said about it.
This is the same Creager who
throws a conniption fit every time he
sees K. K. K. anywhere. The Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan simply gives
him convulsions and he proposes to
have both political parties read the
Klan out of existence this summer
in their national convention plat

SCORES AMERICA
AND CHRISTIANS
Papini, Who Wrote Alleged
“Life of Christ,” Shows
Hate of Protestantism
WOULD CLOSE SCHOOLS
l)r. Charles Faina, of New York
City, Discloses Interesting
Facts to Congress
(Ilurrnu of Publioation and Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON, I). C., April 7.
The Italian write r , Papini, in his last
publication, Omo Salvatico, on page
19 spoke as follows of Protestants:
“Of whatever race of stable Prot
estants might come, they are hemor
rhoids of Luther, rheum of Calvin,
hoofs of Huss, spittles of Zwingli,
scabs of Socinus, scruff of Wesley,
bunions of Fox, expectorations o*
Spencer, emesis of Gensenius, anc
dandruff of Arius.”
On the word America as found in
the same book by Papini on page 149
he states:
“America is the land of millionaire
uncles, the country of trusts, of sky
scrapers, the country of the phono
graph, of the electric car, of the law
of lynching of the .unbearable Wash
ington, of the tedious Emerson, of
the degenerate Walt Whitman, of the
nauseating Longfellow, of the angelic
Wilson, of the philanthropic Morgan,
of the undesirable Edison, and of
other great men of the same stuff.
In return there has come to us from
America the tobacco that poisons,
the syphilis that rots, the chocolate
that nauseates, the potatoes heavy for
the stomach, and the Declaration of
Independence which after a few years
gave birth to the declaration of the
rights of man. From this it follows
that the discovery of America, al
though accomplished by a man who
had many holy qualities, was wished
by God in 1492 as a punishment re
pressive and preventive of all great
discoveries of the Renaissance, that
is, the cannon powder Humanism and
Protestantism.’’
The above is only a little which
shows the spirit of Papini and his
love both for our counrty and Prot
estantism. This man Papini was giv
en a cordial invitation to lecture by
Columbia university in New York. A
man such as this is not worthy of the

SOUTH CAROLINA GENERAL ASSEMBLY FAILS
TO PASS UNIFORM SCHOOL TEXT BOOK LAW
COLUMBIA. S. C.. April 4. Consid
erable disappointment has been ex
pressed throughout the state because
of the failure of the general assem
bly, which concluded its annual ses
sion two weeks ago, to pass the bill
providing for uniform text books in
the schools of the state, and this will
likely be made an issue in the ap
lecturer’s chair in an institution like
Columbia.
All of the above is tal?en from the
testimony of Dr. Charles Faina, 236
Bedford Park boulevard. Bronx, New
York city, given before a congres
sional committee on immigration at
this session of Congress. Is it any
wonder that real, genuine Americans
want restrictive immigration? Why
have such people come to America
and then denounced it as Papini has?
Let him and his kind stay in Italy
where they belong. They are not
wanted in America, and they are un
desirable citizens here.
Far Ist! Papers
Dr. Fama, in his testimony for re
strictive immigration, also put this
in the Record:
“Since Mussonm Decame the pre
mier of Italy, we have had in the
United States a crop of Facisti pa
pers, most of these weekly publica
tions. These papers have come to
America as propaganda for Fascism.
Their attitude is one of persecution
toward those who do not become con
verted to Fascism. In my opinion,
their attitude is bitterly anti-Amer
ican.
“Seventy-five per cent of the teach
ers in the New York public schools
are Roman Catholic. Protestant
teachers are very much discriminated
against, and in places where Catho
lics are in control a war is waged
against the Mason and the Protest
ant.”
Philosophy of Middle Ages
Dr. Fama on the witness stand,
speaking of Papini, told the immi
gration committee that Papini is an
upholder of a universal empire, under
supreme temporal and spiritual rule
by the Pope. And speaking of {lllit
eracy, Papini says:
“If I had anything to do with it,
I would shut up 7Q per cent of the
schools of Italy. The teachers there
of I would place in the fields to dig
the earth. In the remaining few
schools I would have taught only the
Catholic catechism, grammer, and a
little arithmetic. I would have a few
secondary schools continuing to teach
the same subjects. There should be
only two universities, in which the
only subjects taught would be Roman
Catholic theology and Thomistic phil
osophy. In order to put this program
into practice we must have a great
Pope as tempoal and spiritual head
of all.”

CLARINDA, IA„ April 5.-Last
Sunday during the course of the eve

church, a lone Klansman, robed in
the regnlia of the order, entered the
church and walked down the aisle to
the altar. The Rev. Mr. Miller, pas
tor,' was presented with an emefope

This donation was made by the lo

Rev. Mr. Miller preached a sermon
based on the principles upon which
the Klan organisation is founded. A

member was a surprise to everyone.

proaching campaign. The bill was
coupled with another bill providing
for the establishment of a state
printing plant, which should print
the books, and this caused its defeat,
many members of the legislature
doubtiing the feasibility of a state
enterprise of this kind. Even with
this, the bill was defeated by only
two votes in the senate.
The demand for uniform text book
in the state arises out of the fact
that some of the larger cities and
towns are permitted to use in their
schools different text books from
those used in the majority of the
schools in the state, and this has been
the cause of no little dissatisfaction.

only two candidates have been dis
cussed to any extent ir this state,
McAdoo and Underwood, and McAdoo
is away in the lead in public senti
ment but there is a general feeling
in this state that it would be wise
not to commit the delegates to any
particular candidate. Developments
may ensue between the state conven
tion and the national convention
which would be embarrassing if the
delegates were committed.
The party machinery in South Car

various precincts to meet and organ

The clubs elect delegates to the coun
ty convention, which, in turn, elect
delegates to the state convention.
All Democratic candidates in this
state are nominated in primaries held
in August but there is no presiden

left to the state convention.

Congressman Cable of Ohio Gathers Data
(KurcMU of Publication nud Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON, D. C„ April 4.
Ohio is spending a million dollars
each year to care for foreign-born
inmates in public institutes, accord
ing to figures collected by Congress
man John W. Cable, of Lima, member
of the house immigration committee.
This data will be used as an argument
for the passage of the new immigra
tion bill to be voted on in the house
within a week or 10 days.
Sixteen institutions in Ohio have
furnished Mr. Cable with statements
concerning the foreign-born confined
under their care in the Buckeye state.
Some of the facts are astonishing.
Although the foreign-born constitute
less than 12 per cent of Ohio’s total
population, many of the institutions
show the percentage of their inmates
to run as high as 50 per cent for
eign born.
Of the total number in the Cleve
land state hospital more than 50 per
cent are foreign born and cost the
taxpayers of that state more than
$17i,000 last year.
In the Ohio penitentiary at Colum
bus there are 546 foreign-born pris
oners. They cost the state over $115,-
000 each year.
Three hundred and fifteen foreign
born are confined in the Lima state
hospital for the criminal insane.
They cost the taxpayers of Ohio $78,-
750 last year.
Longview hospital, Cincinnati, has
305 foreign born, costing the state
$74,000 each year.
“I intend to use these figures to
show that while the famous ‘melting
pot’ has functioned in some cases, yet
in many it failed to fuse,” said Con-
Klan Principles Are
Preached at Revival
S ALIN A. KAN., April 7.-The
preaching of Klan principles was the
outstanding features of a series of
evangelistic services conducted re
cently by a prominent Kansas minis
ter at the First United Brethren
church. The minister made a plea
for citizens to work for the salvation
of the country and church and for a
better manhood and purer woman
hood.
Because of the large attendance,
many were turned away from the
services. At a special women's meet
ing many in the audience made appli
cation for membership in the Women
of the Ku Klux Klan.
At the final service a group of
Klanmen entered the church and pre
sented SIOO to the preacher to as
sist him in his word. The minister
led the Klansmen in prayer, after
which they retired, amid great ap
plause.

ANTI-KLAN EDITORIAL
AROUSES PROTESTANTS
Klansmen Circulate Handbills to
Offset Mob-Violence Doctrine
Preached by Paper
PITTSBURG, KAN., April I.—Prot
estants in this section are aroused
as never before over an editorial ap
pearing recently in The Mulberry
(Kans.) News, an anti-Klan publica
tion, evidently written with the idea
of inciting riot. That it did not re
sult in the death of some of the
prominent Protestants probably is
due to the fact that the hand bills
to offset The News’ rabid doctrine
were circulated in and around Mul
berry by the law-abiding and peace
loving Klansmen.
Following is an excerpt from the
News’ editorial:
“* * * Nothing on earth will kill
the Kluckers as quickly.” ‘The plan
is all right, hut a whole lot of time
can be saved by killing them in
stanter.”
For the past year The Mulberry
News has been the official organ of
the Loyal Constitutionalists, an or
ganization opposed to the Klan. At
tempts have been made to establish
chapters in other Kansas towns, but,
so far as is known, resulted fail
ure.
Although M. F. Sears, editor of The
News, claims to be a Protestant, he
is “playing the game” and has add
ed many subscribers to his list, as
this district with its large foreign
born population is a fertile field for
his activities. Rumors of a slush
fund raised among wealthy Catholics
to subsidize Sears’ paper, are in cir
culation. Even though many of the
subscribers of The News cannot read
English. Sears gets the money.
