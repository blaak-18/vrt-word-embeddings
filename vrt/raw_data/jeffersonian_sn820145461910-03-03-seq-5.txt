SOME DENSE IGNORANCE IN
GEORGIA.
Dear Sir:—For twenty-two years
the writer has been engaged in the
practice of medicine in South Geor
gia. God never made a country
where the average man could make a
support for himself and family more
easily than in South Georgia. But
from ignorance and the lack of in
terest (missionaries, if you please to
call it), what do we find among a
goodly number of our white popula
tion? Below we will call your atten
tion to a few things that we have
found right here in Georgia: People
too poor to buy cow’s milk for their
children; too ignorant to read the
directions published in the English
language, telling them how to pre
pare the condensed milk that they
are forced to use, through economy,
for their children; too ignorant to
know the Arabic figures upon fever
thermometers, so as to tell when the
temperature was above normal; too
ignorant to keep a chart, so as to
know when medicine or nourishment
was given; too poor to have sufficient
bed linen and clothing to change once
weekly; too ignorant to read the di
rections telling them how and when
to give medicines. It is a fact that
we have adults (white) who could
not tell the hour of the day by a
clock! Now, this ignorance is not
confined to South Georgia. The
writer has had the opportunity of
meeting with ignorance in other sec
tions. We relate this to show that
China, Japan and other foreign coun
tries have no monopoly when it comes
• ignorance and poverty. All of the
Jove being true, we are forced to
kgree with you, Mr. Watson,'in your
‘ fight upon the system of Foreign Mis
sions as they are carried on today.
Let us devote some of the funds go
ing out of Georgia daily to feed and
educate a gang of lazy and brutal
heathens, to the uplifting of our own
people.

HOW THE U. S. AIDS THE ROMAN
DOCTRINE.
Dear Sir: —Is the United States
Government donating, or furnishing,
money in any way to aid the Roman
Catholic church? I have heard that
it was. And I wish to know if it is a
fact.
Please answer through your paper.
Yours very respectfully,

Indeed, yes. It has drawn and is
drawing from year to year, millions
of dollars for Indian Schools, and

say nothing of everlasting appro

A TEXAS LADY DRESSES DOWN
A PHARISEE.
J. M. Farrar, D.D.,
Pastor, Ist Ref. Church,
Brooklyn, N. Y.
Dear Sir:—ln the current issue of
The Christian Herald, you have writ
ten an article of unusual strength
and interest upon the child-labor
question. As an interested reader, I
can not but admire the forceful ar
ray of figures you bring forth, in sup
port of your plea, but I am 'filled
with wonder that you should see
proper to focus the attention of the
public upon the children of the cot
ton-fields of Texas.
- I am a Texan, and being an Amer
ican, and humane, have been inter
ested in the child-labor question for
several years, quite long enough, at
least, to know that we have over
worked and underfed children, in
Texas, as in other States; also that
we do have children picking cotton,
work which lasts about three months
of the year, and is necessarily done
in dry weather, and in fresh air.
Yes, there are children in the cot
ton-fields of Texas, Dr. Farrar, but
there are children much nearer you
in the cotton-mills of New England
to whom a year in the fresh air and
sunshine of these same cotton-fields
would be a veritable godsend.
There are children, by the hun
dreds, perhaps, in our fields during
the three months of our cotton-pick
ing season, but there are children, by
the tens of thousands in your fair
city of New York, who never have a
vacation as pleasant as is the regular
work of the children of the cotton
fields of Texas; children who go
forth, day by day, year after year,
to toil more hopeless and degrading
than is found in all the length and
breadth of the entire State of Texas.
There are children in the cotton
fields of Texas—usually children of
the people for whom they work—but
there are children in your own sec
tion of the country who are slaves—
slaves of a merciless system that
robs its workers of their childhood,
their manhood, and their maturity
—a system that demands of them,
from their early childhood, unceas
ing toil—a system that keeps them
at .work day after day in factories
and mines; r system with workers
who never kj v the light of the sun
nor the pun.y of the air of God’s
great out of doors.
If your Brooklyn-Texas friend
knew a little more of Texas cotton
fields, his remarks descriptive of con
ditions supposedly general here
would bear more weight. I have
seen many children go to the “cotton
patch”, but I have never seen one
whose health was endangered there
by, but, on the contrary, have seen
them healthy, strong and happy.
If affairs in the cotton-fields of the
Brooklyn-Texas man are such as you
seem to indicate, and you will locate
these fields definitely, we will try to
see that conditions are ameliorated.
In the name of the people of Tex
as, I thank both you and the Na
tional Child-Labor Committee for
your prayers, on behalf of “these
child-slaves” of the cotton
fields, and respectfully suggest that
during the remaining nine months
of the year you devote your time to
the Brooklyn-Texas gentleman.
Yours very truly,
GRACE I. PHILLIPS.

CARDINAL GIBBONS LOVES IN
EQUALITY OF FORTUNE.
Dear Sir:—l send you a New
Year’s greeting byway of some
newspaper clippings on Christmas
gifts that has just passed and gone.
They speak for themselves, and tell
the story of the times only too well.
Cardinal Gibbons says in a late mag
azine article: “Unequal distribution
of goods is the law of Divine econo
my. * * * This law of ine-
quality is decreed by a wise dispen
sation of Providence for the exercise
of social virtues, that the strong may
Obe Jeffersonian
aid the weak, the learned instruct
the ignorant, the rich help the poor.”
And I will add—“the devil take the
hindmost.”
And again Cardinal Gibbons says:
“Some are impoverished by the mys
terious dispensation of God.” And
again he says: “You can no more
legislate penury than you can legis
late vice out of existence.”
I will say, however, that it is not
my purpose this morning to enter
into a discussion of this matter, but
merely to call your attention to it,
as you seem to be one of the great
champions of the rights of the com
mon people today. But I must
quote Gibbons again. He says fur
ther: “Can poverty be conquered?
Can we even imagine the world
without the poor? Whatever the
answer may be, one thing is certain:
that we must do all that lies in our
power to conquer poverty, and ren
der the lot of the poor less hard
than it is.”
Cardinal Gibbons’ intentions may
be all right, but he is certainly
wrong when he adopts the theory of
“Divine Right Baer,” and old John
D. Rockefeller in the solution of this
question. Gibbons also intimates
that legislation has had nothing to
do with this unequal distribution of
wealth. I undertake to say that it
has had a great deal to do with it. I
believe it was Byron W. Bolt (I am
not sure about the name), who point
ed out a few years ago that this high
protective tariff robbery was worth
$100,000,000 a year as an “asset” to
the Steel Trust. Then look at the na
tional banker’s Money Trust, the
Railroad Trust, the Beef Trust, the
Sugar Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and
the Standard “All Trust,” every one
of which has been built up and sup
ported by class legislation.
But I have not got the time, nor am
I in the right humor this morning to
discuss these matters, so I will leave
that for you to do in your Jefferson
ian publications.
Very respectfully yours,
A. C. OGBURN.
Pawnee, Okla.
