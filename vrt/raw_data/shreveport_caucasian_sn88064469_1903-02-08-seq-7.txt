grosgrain. andl in the middle 4af these
was a circ.e of lblack nlay Ilab,. leax
ing the middle of the silk. In the c(On
ter of this was a large flat button made
of the fur. An almost incredible
lamounlt of labor must have bleen spent
ill prolduc(ing all these disks. Dlown the
whole garmen.t to the disks there were
bias straps of the silk, with a ilping of
the same. T''here must have been more
thanl twenty of the straps, but they
reached only to the large disks. A deep
yoke was made by the placing of more
of these over the bust. The yoke was
bordered by a narrow hand of the fur.

Inl onle of the "swellest" shops I have
just seen annity iew hats. The quill
seems to be the favorite for all sorts of
runabout hats and for yt!ioung girls.
One in partic.ular was desigl.tted as
hobby and was of very wo,,ly plaid in
dull gi'ays. browns.*yellonu s and a tiny
line of black. one of white and one of
red. The ti-hole upper part of the hat
was of the pllait. Tit c(rown was laid
flat and the brini in deepl folds. Under
the brim was a draped facing of black
velvet fastened at the left side in a
close bunch with a gilt buckle. On the

top, directly across the front, were two
otif quills bearing the shades of the
ground of the hat, a dull brown and
tan.
Another of this style of hat had the
crown and brim both made of beaver
colored, woolen crape. This was laid
til the regulation folds, only they were
not so Bat as most of them. At the
edge the crape overhung the brim,
wileh was of a dull green. Two rolls
of:thi velvet were made to pass
through slits in the crape at the back
and hang down in two knots, the ends
befn malshed off with two black silk
tassell. Quite a number of the hats
base prttty falls of black lace made so

tuguese, Belgian. Dutch and Swiss
press wherever they assembled at o(
of those universal press congresses of
Rome, Paris, Budapest, Stockholm, Lits
bon, Antwerp and other great Eurto
pean cities.
The governing body of the internli
tion:al press congress is the central bu
reau of the World's Press associatlions.
the headquarters of which are .,t PrI'is
and which comprise nearly 1.,X(00
working avd prouminent journalists in
France. E gland. Germany, Italy. Hol

gal, Switzerland. the United States.
Austria-Hungary and other countries.
Only now for the first time these for
eign press representatives intend cross
ing the ocean, modern argonauts in
search of the golden fleece of interna
tiounal peace and concord in every part
of the world.
Hitherto wherever a great exposition
has been organized its authorities were
anxious to have this press congress
(called annually by the central bureau;
meet in the very heart of such interna
tional enterprise. Thus the recent In
ternational expositions of Bordeaux.
Antwerp. Brussels, Hanmburg. Buda
pest. Stockholm and Paris attracted
these press conventions, and it was
quite natural that St. Louis should fol
low their example, although for vari
ous reasons this ninth congress was
called to meet here in 1903, half a year
before the Louisiana Purchase exposi
tion opens its gates. However. the
foreign delegates to the St. Louis con
gress will find in September all the
large palaces complete.
The president of-the central bureau
of the World's Press associations, who
will doubtless preside at the .coming
congress: is William Singer, editor in
chief of the Vienna daily Neues Wiener
Tagblatt, who was elected the first
president of the bureau and has al
ways been re-elected. He possesses a
strong and magnetic persogality and
commands the confidence of his col
leagues in all countries, being perfectly
independent himself in his position as
the sole director of a great, progressive
and liberal Austrian daily journal. The
secretary'general of the bureau, who it
is expected will be here, is Victor Tau
nay of Paris. formert editor of the Ga
zette de France. the oldest French
newspaper, and now one of the editors
of La yerite. He is one of the most
popular journalists of .Europe. known
and beloved in every country.

meet with# most hearty wetcome in the

The Sacred Camel's Journey.
In formes' years the sacred camel's
journey, with the gifts of the sultan to
the shrine of the p)rop)het, which takes
place annually, was made entirely on
foot from Constantinople to Mecca.
Modern ingenuity, with its ever ready
desire to deprive the world of the pic
turesque and add the nmachine under
the plea of g:eater saving of brute
strength, now conveys the camel half
the way by transport. from Scutari to
Beirut.
It Still, howeverl, iniKes tue solemn
and time honored start from the palace
at Scutari. crossing the Bosporus in
great state amid salvos of cannon and
accompanied by all high officials and
religious dignitaries mounted upon and
guarding numerous mules loaded with
boxes, costly gifts and specie required
on the journey. Embroidered saddle
cloths and ostrich plunges adorn the
animals. -and their riders are swathed
in gorgeous robes of yellow, green. biue
and red. When the camel again begins
the land journey at Beirut, It is joined
by hundreds of pilgrims. and by the
time it eventually arrives at Mecca this
number has swelled to thousands of
the faithful anxious to show their re
ligious zeal in guarding the treasure
laden animal on its journey among the
hostile Arab tribes.

Polygamy In Persia.
Polygamy in Persia is on the de
erease, and this, some authorities hold,
is due to the poverty of the land. while
others urge that it is due to the Per
sian being desirous of having a wife
who is a real companion. At present
a gentleman in Persia is never seen in

women lead a dull and restricted life.
