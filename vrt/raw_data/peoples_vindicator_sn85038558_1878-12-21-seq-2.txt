SATURDAY, -- - DEC. 21, 1 r;8.
Vl wed from our Standpoint.
It seems strange that the Nortlh
ernDemocrat should be so timid.
vasilating and infirm ofpnrlpose,
when, by such conduct, they have
lost a President elected lby the
people.
With an opponent whose armor
is rent in an hundred places to let
out life, we find our allies over the
Potomac and Ohio, trembling at
the bellowing of Blhino and the
clatter of the Tribune, instead of
poising lance'and impaling an en
emy that needs but a rigorous push
to collapse.
It may be possible that the
Northern Democracy imagine we
do not understand them; we has
ten to assure our friends that a
further exhibition ot "the hiding
Ostrich" is unbecoming. We see it
all, and beg that they "leave off
their damnable faces and begin."
The World leads the gold DeIm
ocrats and claims the brains of
Democracy for New York or the
East; while the Enquirer, of Cin
cinnati, is equally emphatic that
its the West should lead. To keep
the poise regulated, 'these peoplle
indulge in "side-wipes" at the
South, and cater to the expression
of radical journals and politicians,
that "there's danger in a solid
South."
If the truth must be told, the
South, as a South, has but little
respect for either party North.
We are solid simply in the interest
of self protection and constitution
al liberty. We have some confi
dence in Northern Democrats be
eause they appear to have a ling
ering respect left for a helpless
Speople. For the Republicans we
have an undying hostility, because
they are infamous in everything.
The Democratic party North, as
at present constituted, is an army
of resolute men, with commanders
and staff who don't know how to
set a squadron in the field; and
when, by luck, they tumble on a
victory are frightened into yield
intg it up by the clamor of a de
feated enemy. To make the mat
ter "worse confounded." Ohio
and New York are each "bell
*bent" on furnishimg the Presi
dent, and if they don't, they are
prepareI6o "slaughter the party
at all hazards;" for be it remem
- beret that both are equally deter
mined that Democracy shall only
tuccwd by electing an Ohio and
New York man to the Presidency.
SAs we can't elect both at once,
9Ot tfhances of electing either, or
:%k,-jeoetd, getting him seated, are
gilm indeed. In fact, the Cincin
MtI Znquisirer, rather than the
; rs~dehat saiould not be an
· 'Ohio man," is satisfied with a
,)0p~l1?hi(afl, and rather prefers
maos an Eastern Democrat. In
et d,!the Enqwirer is full of praise
toMi Hayes the cheater, and its de
nanciationof Tilden the cheated, is .
sickining to honest people.
I In our opinion, the success of
our party does not depend upon
th6 aan nominated-the Enquirer
d itas estern allies .think so.
does it depend upon a hard or
ey issue-the World and
friends are so inclin- 1

There is lint one position for a
party of the.people to assume on
these questions. They are of such

The Sikie Debt.
The signs of the times indicate that
the ragged edge has been at last
reached in our State finances. In
other woids, the sclienie of State en
dorsneuments fir private indlividlnals
and c'i Iporations Ihas been stretched
till the line is about to bniak.
'The Evening IDcm, of New Orleans,
says:
Before the war our public debt was
comFpanrtively nothing, and the na
sessed values on which taxation was
laid amounted to S450,(000,000. After
the war assessment: were still re
ported at 250.,00,000t-an excessive
valuation--and the high tax levied on
that amount furnished extensive
pickings and stealings to those who
were "on the make.'" Ufortnnabiely,
so maniny were of tlhat minidul that be
fore the fortnnes of the States passed
to other hands there was little left to
steal. Instead of an improvenent in
real estate there has been therefore a
stepady decline, and the present basis
of taxetion is reduced to $170,000X),(M).
How soon an improvement may take
place is not known, but it certainly
will not occur until the burden of
taxation is lightened.
Now let us figure a little. The an
nual interest of *15,000,000--thle pres
ent constitutional limnitation of the
State deht--is ?1.050,(000 at the ciir
rent late, to wit : seven pier cenit.
Five and a half mills, the amiioniit set
apart by our law nmakers to meet the
State's hbonded Indebtedness, wi 1 plo
duce on l170,000,000 of taxable pro
perty, S953,00)0. Deduct fromi this
amount twenty per cent as the cost of
assessment, collection and non-pay
iment in special cases, and we have
$73l8,000 to meet an annual interest
account of $1.050.000. It woul,
therefore, lie necessary every year to
borrow $312,)000 to meet the current
interest, saying nothing of the prin
cipal!
''This plan of borrowing to pay in
terest has gone habult as far as it can
go. The State fise is on the ragged
edge, with a dark and deep abyss
beneath and Ino ldaring Crtills ap
pears to leap into the gulf. In this
dilemma the Funding Board will have
to unlearn what it has learned amiss,
go back upon its ownI reckless doings,
and take a new departure. Half of
the obligations fnnded, the State has
no more right to pay than it has to
pay the debts of the Consolidated
Association of Planters, or those of
the Citizens' Bank. Let a halt he
called before confusion beclnome worse
confounded.
We have noticed with alarm this
borrowing to pas interest, fully be
lieving that it must result to the State
as it has always to individual debtors
who followed the sanme plan. It
seems to us that no policy has been
adopted, worthy the name, for the
liquidation of our debt. On the con
trary, there has been an appeal con
tinually made to the "honor" of the
taxpayer to "sustain the credit of the
State," without an effort to reduce a
burden, which in'timrne they were cer
tain to relieve themselves of.
The conviction has settled itself on
the public mind in this State that the
payment of this 5j mills "interest
tax" is a thing of eternity ; that it
will grind on, grind ever, until we
become but tbo slaves of sharks and
bond-holders. And many good hon
eat men are questioning the propriety
of utter repudiation instead of ttter
starvation.
It is folly to talk to men, "of ihon
or," when that honor depends on the
payment of money they have not.
They might be ever so willing to
give up life to keep untarnished their
good name as a debt paying people,
but lives don't pay dollars, and bond
holders demand more than blood
We know taxpayers who borrowed
money last year at 30 per cent to pay ,
their taxes, and give Governor Nich
oils' administration their support;
this year they cannot borrow; nor I
have they the will to do so.
The truth of the business is, that
January will bring bankruptcy to
thousands of individuals and corpo- ~
rations, and Louisiana will go down
with many a good, honest man who
cannot pay his debts, simply because
he hasn't the money.
The citizens of Louisiana have
been bankrupted by the ten years ,.
of rapacious Radical rule; they can t
pay no more because they have noth- i
iog, and they must have a breathing p
spell. n

STHE SECTIONAL DEBATE.
s Blaine Opens-Thuurinan and Lamar
of Repli.
e Probable Extent of the question.
Rt- -
1, The Washington slpecial conrres
( ponldent of the Picnyune gives the
it following account of thlle dlebate inll
Sthe senate on Blaine's resolution :
The anoullncenelllt that Mr. Blaine
n would call up his resolution drew
d a great crowd to the senate to-day.
SThe galleries and the floor were
1- full to overflowilng. A large nlum1
is 1er of memben'rs of the house were
e present. Blaine spoke with his
R, usual fire and animnation. His
I positions were specious andl plaus
ible, but after all it was only a
,, stumip speech.
1 Juliidge Thurman was in his best
ýf reiin when ihe rose to reply. His
l0 answerl was a perfectly trinumphant
(e pij'e of logic, and there was aiout
himl a sense of easy- power andl
is strength which fornmed ain lnplres
-sive contrast to Blaine's eager,
e ambitious etfort at d(lisplay. It
was like a wise father rebuking a
[t spoiled child for Ilis petulence and
foolishness Mr. Lamar also made
some very telling anld(l etrective
e points, which brought Edmund
- and Blaine to their feet in an iml
- ploteltt attempt to mistate Mr.
e Lamar's position. Lamar's ex
e p1ression of regret that Blaine had 1
a not brought forward some liberal 1
measure of edlucationl for the blacks I
made Blaine wince and look as if
lie had forgotten something. On 1
"the whole the victory lay with the 1
e Democratic champions. The big "
t gun had been fired oft, and-the 1
t Democrats all feel that the bloody '
e shirt element got the worst of it. i
SThere was applause for both sides, i
but more for Thurman than 1
Blaine. It was well understood 2
all over the floor that Elaine's I
' (lemonstration was merely at
presidlential bid-a device to
get ahead of Conkling and Grant.
Mr. Conkling went on writing in 3
hi' usual contemptuous style du- f
> ring Blaine's speech, and Ed- c
r munds would probably have re- I
maincd silent if Lamar had not (
referred to Vermont. The Re- C
publicans will not be willing to lI
let tile debate stop at this point. I
I predict that Blaine will speak t
again, and other Radicals. There ni
will be replies by Beck, Lamar ,
and others, and a long, bitter de- (
bate. Senator Butler will defend
South Carolina, and will expose
the Radical conspiracy to repeal
the representation for the colored
vote. At this rate there may he
an extra session after all. f

OUR RAILROAD. n
[Donaldsonville Chief.J el
We are informed that a pronminent New '
Orleans merchant who is interested in f
sugar planting in this parish, stated yes- ii
terday that the line of railroad extend- n
ing from New Orleons to and beyond (1
Donalfsonville had been sold by the b
present owners to the N. O. Pacific.Rail- tl
way Company. If this is indeed the case
a matter of much importance to this -
town and parish has been settled to our Ii
advantage. The N. O. P. Company has I
been for some months steadily prosecu- IH
ting the work of constructing their pro- oi
posed road, having begun near Alexan- k
dria and worked both ways, with a view ti
to placing New Orleans and Shreveport tl
in connection at the earliest possible day. ti
About the middle of November the force
of laborers grading in this direction had
reached a point only fifteen miles from t(
Bayou GosILa, and it became a question b
of close interest to this section whether hr
the road would connect with our line, t
or traverse the left bank of the river T
from Bayou Goula to New Orleans, the at
company's charter giving them the right
to adopt either course. The selection of ai
the route depended upon the result of m
. the negotiations opened recently for the B
prchase of the road in operation between
Orleans and Donaldsohville. to. o1

they were in the woods haotingm dee

In the evening it clanced that thle

to thle hrouse of MIr. Lambethl, also a
