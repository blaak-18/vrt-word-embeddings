FRANCE BEING COACHED TO
DOMINATE THE CONTINENT
WITH HER MILITARY
POWER "
—K-K-K
The world is not in sympathy with
the French occupation of the Ruhr,
says Billy Mayfield.
France is too feverishly active in
building war equipment and amassing
war supplies.
There is a greatr-big scheme brew
ing in the Vatican, and you will see
it all come out in time.
The Vatican saw a chance to play
with the Kaiser and dominate all
Europe, and the Kaiser was inspired
and prodded from the Vatican until
he was keyed into precipitating a
.world conflagration. The Kaiser in
his memoirs told of his repeated vis
its to the Vatican, and there is where
he got his idea of world domination.
The same old Vatican is now try
ing to reach the same goal through
another channel. It is playing the
French *o win, and Poincaire is vain
ly dreaming of world control. He is
the catspaw that is reaching out for
the chesnuts of the Pope.
He has assembled the world’s great
est air fleet, he has mustered the
world’s greatest standfng army; he
has assembled the world’s greatest
battery of big guns; he has accumu
lated the world’s greatest supply of
war chemicals, in fact France today
has the best equipped military or
ganization on earth, and poverty
stricken France hasn’t assembled her
gigantic military forces to look at.
There is a purpose behind and back
of it all.
France is being ribbed by the Pope
to make a try for European domina
tion. No nation can be kidded into
trying to dominate the world as long
as Old Glory floats in the western
hemisphere.
The first move of the big game was
the Pope’s rehabilitation of Bohemia.
The second move was the invasion of
the Ruhr. The third movement was
the secession of Bavaria while Ger
many was held helpless by the French
in the Ruhr.
The Pope now has under his. thumb
Belgium, France, Italy, Bavaria, and
Austria. These broke countries rep
resent his physical assets, and a few
South American countries represent
his liabilities. Spain is about to
shake off the Catholic yoke. France
has put it back on for expediency’s
sake. -
France is being coached to domi
nate the continent with her military
forces, and then the Pope will try
for his big coup. He wants to de
stroy England.
He is going to steer ’France and
England into a war, and in that war
you will see Germany lined up with
England and the United States.
Folks that is what is going to hap
pen as certain as the sunrise.
The Pope’s attempt to line up with
the Japanese has been a signal fail
ure.
The French move in Germany and
the disintegration of the Prussian
Empire i the first move in a gigan
tic assault that will be made on Eng
land by national tools of the Vatican
monarchy.
The Pope is having no luck in
America. His class does not appeal
to the average American citizen, and
now the bulk of the" Pope’s efforts
in this • country are centered op. the
negro. He wants black priests to
take confessions from white women.
He knows no color line. He is a be
liever ip social equality.
Follow the prediction about the
European embroglio.
Some* day you will see England,
Germany and the United States lined
up in a death battle with the rest
of Europe fighting under the Vatican
leadership.
Lloyd George knows it.
General Ludendorff knows it and
we Americans are fast learning it.

WICKEDNESS OF FERGUS FALLS
—K-K-K
The Call of the North, a newspaper
published in St. Paul whose object
appears to be to reform the world
devotes half a column of a recent is
sue to the scandalous and immoral
conditions that exist in Fergus Falls.
As a good second in evil, it picks
the bad village of Pelican Rapids.
Those who imagined Pelican Rapids
as a village above the average in
righteousness and sobriety will be
shocked. Those who knew Fergus
Falls to be one of the cleanest and
decentest of the smaller cities .of
Minnesota will be horrified.
- The shock and horror, however,
will be mitigated when the charges
are more closely studied.
The case against Fergus Falls is
a recital of that vicious effort of
two men in an automobile, three or
four weeks ago, to persuade a little
girl to enter their car. It was after
dusk, and no person saw the car
number, nor knew of the outrage un
til its perpetrators were safely out
of sight. They may have come from
St. Paul or even Pelican Rapids.
Needless to say, local efforts were
vigorous and persistent to get some
due to these two young savages.
As to the illicit liquor traffic, both
at Pelican Rapids and Fergus Falls,
the information of the Call of the
North was derived exclusively from
;he police and court reports which
followed the arrest and sentencing of
the offenders by the local authorities
and courts, which appears to remove
'erious need of outside assistance.
The Call of the North has evident
ly been studying the call of the South
to help exterminate certain classes of
citizens who have as much right to
be here, and as much of a stake in
the moral and religious character of
this country as any of the rest of its
inhabitants. Fergus Falls Tribune,
Nov. 29, 1923.

--DEAR READER, READ AND
WONDER „
Two young ladies employed at the
state hospital here were accosted by
a man in an automobile Sunday even
ing and urged to enter his car. They
ignored him and he kept alongside
of them for a short distance and
finally jumped from the car and
seized one of them. They screamed
and he fled. This sort of thing is
becoming too common here and it is
time that citizens woke up. It has
been one* of the city’s, boasts that
girls and women were always safe
on the streets and if this party is
caught, he should not be allowed to

Flaming Emblem on Nearby Site
Revives Talk of Klan Activity,
—K-K-K
Virginia, Minn.—Residents of Vir
ginia and persons livng south of town
between Virginia and Eveleth are
wondering today just what was the
significance of the burning of a huge
cross near the top of Auburn hill
Wednesday night.
This is the second demonstration
of its nature within the past five
months. The first occurred on ,a re
cent evening just preceding the an
nual school board election and was
attributed to the Ku Klux Klan,
which, rumors have it, is organized
on the Mesaba range.
As the city has no elections in the
immediate future, nor any political
or religious question of importance
to be decided, the incident is taken
by those who. believe in the Klan ru
mors to have been a gathering of the
organization, called for an open dem
onstration or initiation. The site of
the gathering for hundreds of foot
prints surround the charred embers
of the cross, lies about half way be
tween the old Eveleth-Virginia road
and the new highway connect
ing the two cities near the top of
Auburn hill.
The cross was burned about mid
night Wednesday, but owing to the
fact that the location is hardly ac
cessible by automobile and represents
a long walk through woods and .snow
covered fields, feWj if any, outsiders
were drawn to the seen*.
The burning of two crosses on the
night of July 22 not far from the
scene of Wednesday night’s
rence was followed by rumors of
Klan activities 'and was thought to
have had a bearing on the school
election the next day when religious
affiliations cut some figure.

Urbans, 111.—Dr. H. W. Evans,
Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux

dress hers last Friday night when
the Zenith Klan dedicated -the new
Klavern recently purchased by it and
in which is the Zenith theater, which
was formerly known as the Illinois.
Dr. Evans spoke before a big audi
ence which was most appreciative of
his address.
During his stay in Urbana, Dr.
Evans delivered two addresses, speak
ing before the Women *of the Ku
Klux Klan in the afternoon and in
the evening before an audience com
posed solely of Klansmen.
The Grand Dragon of Illinois also
delivered an address and there were
short talks by other speakers. The
meeting was a part of a two-day pro-,
gram announced by the Zenith Klan.
The celebration given lasted over un
til Saturday and was attended by
thousands of Klansmen from many
points in Illinois and some places in
Indiana.
The new Klavern is * magnificent
office building which was purchased
by the Zenith Klan, which is one of
the most active Klans in Illinois.
The headquarters of the organiza
tion will be in the building and meet
ings will be held there. The pur
chase of the building was a surprise
to many persons who had believed
stories of the enemy that the Klan
in this county was more or less a
myth.

—K-K-K
New York.—Revelations' that fraud

being peddled to immigrants at Eu
ropean ports with the same freedom
that million mark notes were sold on
New York strets, we;e made by Au
gust V. Tozzi, former president of
the Italian immigration society, at
the legislative investigation if immi
grant exploitation Wednesday. Aliens
bound for "the United States are be
ing charged from SIOO- to SSOO by
unscrupulous vendors of the forged
documents, he said.
In addition to the birth record
scheme, Mr. Tozzi asserted, pass
posts, never used from a United
States port, were made out whole
sale and mailed to Europe to help in
evading immigration laws. These
passports, he explained, were the
usual permits issued to foreigners in
jfie United States to visit their Euro
pean homes for six months. By as
suming the name of the residenf to
-whom the passport was made out, the
immigrant could enter without diffi
culty.
Other FraucfslEx posed
Thousands of cases „of fraud of
every description had been uncovered
by the immigration society in the
past 16 years, Mr. Tozzi testified.
“The boarding houses’ swindle was
nerhaps the commonest,” he said.
“Immigrants arriving here would be
rushed to these places by runners
meeting the ships and would be asked
to give up their baggage checks so
their belongings could be brought to
the house. Then they would have to
pay from $5 to sls apiece before the
baggage checks or their trunks would
be returned to them.
“We-have had disappearances point r
ing to murder. We have had immi
grants killed by gas under equally
suspicious circumstances and when
he bodies were found, merely a nom
inal sum —say the amount necessary
to secure admittance to the United
States —would be found on them.
“We have had railroad agents sell
ing tickets to immigrants at the
piers, charging the alleged equivalent
for the American fare, changing the
rest of the immigrants’ money into
American currency and collecting a
tidy premium of 20 to 40 per cent.
The railroads probably do hot know
this, but it goes on just the same.”
Quack Doctors Accused
Charges that quack doctors were
fleecing immigrants out of millions
of dailars were made by Dr. Antonio
Stella, formerly personal physician
to the late Enrico Caruso. Dr. Stella
said it wa- almost impossible to get
legal action against these quacks un
der the present laws. He told the
committee that foreigners, suffering
from illness of any sort, were lvyred
to institutions offering free examina
tions. The diagnosis was invariably
tuberculosis, although the patient was
suffering only from a slight cough,
he said. When the cough disappear

As a result of eertain activities on

Two fiery crosses burned in the
city last night. .
One of them a small eighteen inch
affair was burned on the corner of
Mill street and Lincoln.
The other, a 15 foot wooden cross
was burned on what is sometimes
known as “Nigger” hill northwest of
Broadway and Banana.
The crosses seemed to have been set
afire at the same time, somewhere
between ten and eleven o’clock. There
were but a few persons on the street
when the small cross was set afire. It
burned about 15 minutes.
Charred remains of the small cross,
now at the police station, disprove
any theory that the burnings were the
prank of mischievous boys. The arms
of the cross are built of heavy wire,
set in *. wooden block a few inches
square. The arms were taped even

showing evidence of experienced and
expert workmanship.

KLAN LAUDED BY ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES
THE OUTLOOK AND THE NEW REPUBLIC APPEAR SAME DAY
New York. —That the alien ele
ments and foreign interests, banded
together in America as a part of the
amalgamated enemies of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, are becoming
alarmed over the trend of the higher
class periodicals toward the Klan or
ganization is seen in the feverish at
tempts to create an impression that
the Klan is losing strength. Atten
tion was drawn to the fact that dur
ing the past week two magazines ap
peared, both bearing the date of No
vember 21, in which much space was
given to certain laudatory paragraphs
concerning the Klan.
The magazines in question were the
New Republic and the Outlook. The
similarity of the two articles which
the magazines printed was marked;
that is, that the membership is of
high quality citizens and that it* is
doing a good work.
Membership Is Landed
“It is absurd,” declares the New
Republic, “to suppose that the Ku
Klux Klan is composed of the com
munity’s dregs * * *. Roth in the
North and the South there are hun
dreds of thousands of Klansmen who
are solid respectable citizens, kind
and loving husbands and fathers, con
scientious members of their church.”
In the article in the Outlook, Stan
ley Frost says: “In considering this
situation I must ask the reader to
hold in suspense, as far as may be,
previous opinions about the Klan and
its membership, and to judge the case
afresh. I myself learned the need of
this from the first man I interviewed
in the state of Oklahoma. He is a fine
type, a graduate of one of our fam
ous universities, editor of a power
ful newspaper, a leader in work for
good government on the broadest
lines, a decided liberal, and a mighty
fighter against the. Klan. He had
been a Walton supporter. This is what

—K-K-K
Orlando, Fla.—Charles H. Ketchum,
last year’s Grand Master of the
Grand Lodge, A. F. & A. M. of Flor

the Ku Klux Klan of the state at the
state Klonvocation field here last
week. The Klonvocation was called
by -the Imperial Palace for the pur
pose of perfecting the organization
for the Realm of Florida, making
this state the twentieth to obtain a
state organizaion.
The new Grand Dragon is a 33rd

ber of he Supreme Council of the
Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction.
Announcement of the unanimous
appointment of Mr. Ketchum as
Grand Dragon was received with en

A member of the Imperial -Staff
will remain in Florida for several
weeks to assist the state organization
in getting under way. Imperial Kla

to announce Grand Master Ketchum’s

“You’ll never get things straight
here if you think of the Klan as a lot
of scalawags and criminals. * * *.
It includes many of the best people in
the state; it is strongly supported by
most of the Protestant organizaions,
and a great majority of preachers
are in it. It has been on the right
side of most public questions and
there is rot the shadow of a doubt
that so far -its- influence has been
good. There is no use raising a false
issue.” ' «
Charges Not Substantiated
Continuing, the writer in the Out
look says: “It (the Klan) has fought
Walton from the start —a very dis
tinct credit. It has fought graft,
corruption, and maladministration in
many ways. The towns where its
members are in office are far better
of than they were. * * * In con
sidering the Invisible Empire it must
be remembered that the secrecy which
is so powerful a weapon in this case
turns against the Klan. Since no one
knows what goes on behind the white
hoods it is possible to charge the worst
of purposes, the worst of methods,
and the worst of everything. Such
charges are freely enough made.
Bribery, intimidation, every possible
evil, are alleged. These charges do
not seem to me to fit well with the
known record.”
The New Republic, after declaring
that the Klan has from 2,500,000 to
4,000,000 members, say's: “It should
be noted that the Klan, as it enters
new communities, begins with the
leading citizens.” It then goes on to
say that it is probably the war that

The Fourth Regiment Armory will

Oklahoma City, Okla.—ln answer

COO Protestant hospital, according to
Grand Dragon N. C. Jewett.
The new hospital will be open to
all creeds and denominations.
about by the system that has ruled
Europe for cenuries past, is no douut
why the ranks of the Klan today are
filled with doughboys who fought
overseas.
In giving other reasons why the
Klans continues to secure its tens of
thousands of members each week,
the article points out that which the
foe of the Klan derides as not. true,
namely, that “there is undoubtedly
much truth in the charge that news
papers are afraid to discuss with any
degree of frankness the alfairs of the
Catholic church. So are educators,
public speakers, and most of ail,
politicians. * * * Similar taboos
exist in a lesser degree in regard to
the position of the Jew.”
“Education Is Needed”
In the closing paragraph of the
article, the writer says: “Above all,
we need historical education as to
what American ideals really are.”
The two articles quoted from are
but two of many that show a s.ow
but sure trend toward the Ku Klux
Klan. Within the past few months
it has been seen that the public is
tired of the continuous apd seemingly
unending string of malicious state
ments—which have never been proved
in the slightest degree—which the
enemy has given to the press and
“shouted from the housetops.”
Every weapon employed by the
militant enemy of Protestantism in
America, and which have been wield
ed against the Klan organization
have been bent and destroyed. For
this reason the foe is desperate, and
with many articles now appearing
in the magazines of the country
which abound with laudatory state
ments concerning the Klan, this
enemy is, as was stated in the first
paragraph, much alarmed.
