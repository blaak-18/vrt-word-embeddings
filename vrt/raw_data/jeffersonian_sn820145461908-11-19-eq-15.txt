hers. God had given it to her. But
the next thought caught and held
her in its sharpness.
Why had the child been given to
her? To keep, to love, and, alas,
some day to give into the charge of
another.
Then, at once, the motherhood that
dwelt within her, ennobled her. Reso
lutely she turned from the picture.
Her duty lay straight before her and
she would not shirk it.
One last, lingering look she gave
to the baby Helen. Then, quietly
mounting the stairs, she passed down
the long hall leading to her daugh
ter’s room. She knocked with a
steady hand. Helen answered.
Something in her mother’s face ar
rested her attention. The light that
lay in her dear eyes, the smile that
transfigured her sweet lips, touched
Helen keenly.
“Has anything happened, moth
er?” she asked.
“Yes, Helen, somethin* has hap
pened,” the mother replied.
Then she drew the girl to a seat on
the wide couch, and folded the slight
figure to her.
“You must go with Leonard,” she
began. “No, do not draw away, little
girl.” She paused. “I have cheated
you out of too much happiness.”
The girl shivered.
“I can’t understand, mother —”
she said, just as she had spoken to
her husband.
“You will not understand, Helen,”
the mother’s voice trembled and
caught in her words; “you will not
understand until you have risen to
the heights of sacrifice. When you
have worked for Len, when you have
shared his troubles, then you will un
derstand. ’ ’
The door opened suddenly. Leonard
stood on the threshold. At sight of
■the two women, his face hardened
into bitter lines. Why was the moth
er here? Could she then so easily
take his place? Then his eyes caught
and rested on Helen’s white face. She
leaned forward as if to beckon to
him. At once, he went to her, urged
by something within him. The great
love that he bore her came forward
and found utterance in hasty words.
“Helen,” he cried, “I’ve thought
it all out. I have been cruel and sel
fish. Can you forgive me? We shall
stay here and you shall do as you
please. That empty room in there
has taught me that nothing matters so
that we are together.”
Helen leaned forward, impelled by
the birth of something within her
heart.
“Listen, dear boy,” she whispered,
softly. 11 Mother has opened my eyes.
They are not wide awake yet,” she
finished laughingly, yet with a treach
erous sob in her throat, “but mother
says—”
He looked up wonderingly as she
paused. It was the white-haired wo
man Who answered the look in his
eyes:
“Mother says,” she murmured,
taking up her daughter’s words;
“Mother says that you two children
are to begin life together now in
your own little home.”
Leonard caught her hand in his.
With the instinct that is sometimes
given to man, he caught the trembling
renunciation in her voice. He carried
her hand reverently to his lips.
“Mother,” he said, softly, “I shall
love you (always. ’ ’
And the silence that followed was
ripe with the promise of many
things.—The Housekeeper.
A PRAYER.
Give us courage and gaiety and the
quiet mind. The day returns and
brings us the petty round of irritat
ing concerns and duties. Help us to
play the man, help us to perform
them with laughter and kind faces,
let cheerfulness abound with indus
try. Give us to awake with smiles,
give us to labor smiling. Give us
health, food, bright weather, and
light hearts. Let us lie down with
out fear and awake and arise with
exaltation. Grant us courage to en
dure lesser ills unshaken, and to ac
cept death, loss and disappointment
as it were straws upon the tide of life.
When day returns, return to us our
sun and comforter, and call us up
with morning faces and morning
hearts —eager to labor—eager to be
happy if happiness shall be our por
tion—and if the day be marked with
sorrow, strong to endure it. —Robert
Louis Stevenson.
A SHINING MARK.
A lady, grievously tormented with
a corn on her toe, was advised by one
of her friends to anoint it with phos
phorus, which in a weak moment she
did, but forgot to tell her husband
before retiring at night. It had just
turned 12 when the husband awoke
and was startled to see something
sparkling at the foot of the bed. He
had never heard of a firefly in the
locality, nor did he ever remember
seeing such a terrible looking object
as the toe presented. Reaching care
fully out of bed till he found one of
his slippers, he raised it high in the
air and brought it down with great
force upon the mysterious light.
A shriek and an avalanche of bed
clothes, and all was over. When at
last he released himself from the bed
clothes he discovered his wife groan
ing in a corner of the bedroom, but
she had got rid of that phosphorated
corn. —London Graphic.
