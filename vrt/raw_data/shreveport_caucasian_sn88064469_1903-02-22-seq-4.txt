"TYRANNICAL SELFISHNESS."
In an editorial in its issue of Sun
day. February 15. the New Orleans
States hurled a philippic at Mr. Bryan,
under the caption quoted-"Tyrannical
Selfishness." What has been Mr. Bry
an's offense? Why should he have been
raked fore and aft mercilessly? Is it
because he declined to attend a meet
ing or a conference or a "dining" at
which Mr. Cleveland was invited? Is
A not Mr. Bryan's privilege and his
right to accept or reject an invitation,
or to decline attendance at a gathering
where his views, or his presence would
not be congenial; where perhaps, his
absence would be better appreciated
than his presence? It is our candid
opinion that the expressions of the
States were ill-times and are not sug
gestive of harmony and unity, except it
be in accordance with the Cleveland
view of harmony. The States has de
clared that "Mr. Bryan stands alone
wrapped in the solicitude of his own
vindictiveness." In what respect? Is it
because he has no sympathy with the
Clevelandites of the party and is frank
enough to not disguise it? Mr. Bryan
has announced that he is no candidate
for the presidential nomination, there
fore the Clevelandites should be well
satisfied, but as the recognized leader
of the Democracy, which would have
triumphed if its defeat had not been
accomplislied through the aid and as
sistance given McKinley by the sup
porters of Palmer-Buckner-gold-bug
Wall-street combine-Mr. Bryan has at
his back six millions and more of loyal
Democrats who were true to the prin
ciples and to the teachings of their
party, true to the platform of the party,
tree to the man who was nominated by
accredited, loyal Democrats in a con
vention of Democrats, where the rep
resentatives were elected - b Demo
crats to nominate a Democrat to stand
on and carry out the dictates of prin
ciples as enunciated by that Democratic
convention? Why should the States in
dulge in an effort to discredit "Bryan
ism"? Why sneer at Bryanism? What
is Bryanism ? We may retort it is the
opposite of Clevelandfsm. What is the
intent of the States when it alludes to
Bryan in these words: "if the Demo
cratic party in t&96 lsad practiced the
exchusion policy which Mr. Bryan now
Padvocates he would` be today remem
bered but as the leader of the defunct
Populist organization, nor would he be
in a posion to so vex the Demociacy
now. It tauA be plain to Democrats by
this time that if the part, ever hopes I
to accomplish any ing it, must ignore
Mr. Bryan"? Why inject such venom
otis utterances in a pleading which
should have been mild, generous, sug
estve of harmony and lo'veful unity?
I the Rsam espirit of artagonism the six
sgglions and more of Bryanites and
Populists who supported Mr. Bryan
against the Cleveland-Palmer-Buckner
gord-bug-Wall-street and Mr. McKiit
ley combination may retort: " It msst t
be Plain to Democrats by this time that
if the party ever hopes to accomplish
saything it must ignore' Mr. Clevelandt
On this occasion the States, usually
liberal in its views, conservative in its
expressions in the interests of Democ
racy, has permitted its bias and its pre
judice to mislead Lit to intemperate, in
harmonious reflections which are irri
tants. and are calculated to arouse re
sentment on the part of the Democrats,
six million and more, who have been
loyal to ,'Bryanism" and Democracy in
oppositibn to Clevelandism. We tire
sorry for the States.
One of the incomprehensible ani
illogical conclusions of men, organizedl
on what should be well defined princi
pies of right-eguity and justice-is
their irrational, unequal and unjust de
cisions. Which is the incentive, ignor
ance or prejudice, or both?

(Continued from page. 7.)
Our attention has been called to the
fact that Mr. B. K. Jarrett, one of your
firemen whose salary is fifty dollars
($50) per month, has been for some
time and is now doing blacksmith
work for the department, which is quite
a saving to the city: in view of his we
recommend that his salary be increased
to sixty dollars ($60) per monlt,. ddt
ing from February i.
In this connection we recommend
that as an inducement to our firemen
to remain with the department. and as
encouragement for good conduct and
faithful service. you establish the fol
lowing rule governing the pay of our
reeular firemen, beginning March t.
Their salary now being fifty dollars
($50) per month, that after six months
satisfactory service their salary be in
creased to $ss, and at the end of one
year's satisfactory service to $6o. This
to be the maximum. Respectfully sub
mitted.

By Mr. Wise
From estimates of Mr. George R. 1
Wilson. engineer, them are 2,too cubic I
yards of excavation on Foster street
between Hulsee street and the pro
posed extension to Stoner avenue, of
which goo yards are required to bring 1
Foster street up to grade, leaving t.2oo
yards surplus. Including tiling the cost
will be $350 for a 4o-foot street. An
offer of $175 will be made for the 1.2oo
yards of earth, reducing the cost to
$175. exclusive of value of Mr. Busby's
tract of ground 40x300 feet.
To open Hulsee street for a good
wagon road only (not a street proper)
reouires 1,770 yards sitting at 15c
$265-00.
Eight thousand and fifty yards filling
less 1770 yards. 6,380 yards 4 be c
bought at 25C, $1,595.
One hundred and twelve feet < 36
inch drain pipe at 2 1-2c. $275.
To allow residents of south part of f
Foster street to reach Hulsee street re- c
quires goo yards of earth to be bought, t
$225. Add railing Foster to Donovan r
street. $60. Making a total of $2,42 '
Maintenance of the wagon road will ?
cost 1o per cent annually or approxi
nately $240. 0
In case of fire this district is entire- E
fy without any protection. The closest
available water hydrant being on Ston- 4
!r avenue.
School children in this district attend 3
Texarkana Annex and high school, and
in rainy seasons walk 13oq4eet on Don- 4
)van street through mud over their
;hoe mouths from Hulsee street to 8
Hlamilton Terarce to Jordan street. On
Uonovan street there is not even a
)lank for a sidewalk for this distance
with the exception of that in front. of
rvy's store.
To Petitioners: As regards opening
)f Foster street, Stoner avenue to Hul
see street, I have made estimate of cost
>f opening Foster street, also estimate
in Hulsee street. I find on Foster street
nIoQ cubic yards of cutting, goo cubic lh
yards of filling and forty feet of 24-inch t(
ile. On Hulsee street I have 1770 cubic c
'ards of cutting and 815o cubic yards -l
illing with 112 feet feet 36-inch drain a
>ipe. a glance you can see by above
igure t the openin of Foster street
s much cheaper to the city, also the
mnracticebflity of getting dirt to fill
-ulsee street. The trades used on Hul
.ee street make quite a decline over the 4
;ranch and would hardly be adopted by
he city. 4
Nevertheless the above estrr ate
shows what it would cost to put a new
wagon road from Foster street to Don
ovan street. The estimate on Foster
street I tlhink is quite conservative and
the grades will conform to grades to
be established by the city. The cost of
'grading Foster street from Hulsee to
Stoner avenue $330. The cuts only on
Foster street are estimated in the cost,
as the dirt can be wasted on the fill. I
estimate the cost on cut at roc per cubic
yards. Yours very respectfully,
GEO. R. WILSON, Engineer.

suitable and accessible ground for the

in part already occupied and has Teen
for a period of years past. by the im

the said ground so occupied by said as

use it as a base ball park. Said alley
that petitioner desires to close in said
block lies between Walnut and Dove

shows that unless petitioner can be per

said city.
Therefore your petitioner prays diat
