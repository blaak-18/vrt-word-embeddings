WINTHROP'S ROMANCE. 1
What Bbattered the Lieutenant's
- Dream of Love.
"Miss Garland, my daughter-Lieut.
Winthrop."
The tall, handsome officer bowed low
over the tiny hand extended to him.
.'Delighted, I am sure, to make your
acquaintance, Miss Garland. All the
boys have been talking so much about
you that I feel I almost know you."
"Lieut. Winthrop," turning toward
him coquettishly, "1 think that is pure
flattery, as surely in two weeks you
have had time to make my acquaint
ance, if you were so desirous of it."
"True, but then you see I only re
turned a day ago."
As he spoke the band played the
march for supper, and, offering his arm,
Lieut. Winthrop led his partner from
theballroom.
Lieut. WVill Winthrop was one of the
most popular officers of the -th. Al
though but twenty-eight, he had been
in many campaigns, and was now on
leave, spending his time at that most
delightful place, Point Comfort.
Mliss Daisy Garland was one of the
belles of the place. She was not a tall,
stately "society" woman, but an im
pulsive southern girl. She was the
onlychild of a millionaire orange plan
tation holder. lHaving been educated
in Virginia, she had been in society but
a short time, yet was already one of
the most sought after and favored girls
in the rlace.
Two days after the ball Winthrop
might have been seen slowly strolling
up toward the pretty eottagcMlr. Gar
land had hired for tne time he and his
-laughter were to spend at I'oint Com
fort. If anyone had told Will lie wnas
going to see his pretty partner of the
ball he would have politely told him he
was crazy. Oh, no! his praiseworthy
intention was to have a cozy talk with
iMr. Garland about the least romantic
subject, financial news.
Although very few knew it, Lieut.
\V. Winthrop had a snug little fortune
invested in the far north. Ever since
his cadet days he had laid aside part of
the generous allowance his father sent
him.
"Of course," Winthrop soliloquized
as he went along, "everyone thinks
just blecause there i:; a pretty girl here
I come to sec her, but I will show them
the contrary."
As he arrived at this conclusion lie
marched up the steps and gave a de
termined pull at the great lion's head
that servef as a knocker. A trim maid
servant opened the door and toad him
the master was out, but she had orders
to ask thelientenantin when he called,
as Mr. Garland had left a message.
Even as she spoke the parlor door
was pushed open and Miss Daisy ap
poared.
"Alh! Mr.-1 mean," with a pretty
blush and smile, "Lieut. Winthrop, so
you have come at last," and she put
out her dainty I and, which was cor
dially clasped in his for a moment.
"Papa waited until a few minutes
ago for you and instructed me to keep
you if you caine until his return. You
can see him at the club if you care to
go there, but I am quite alone and will
be very pleased mnot to have to wait
alone," she continued, pleasantly.
"Well, Miss Garland, if I won't in
terrupt you reading, for I see you have
been quite studious by the book you
carry, I will wait for MIr. Garland here."
As Will followed his hostess in he
could hardly conceal his surprise at the
beauty of the drawing-room. The
walls 'were hung in the palest
rose color. Great ]bunging chairs aund
tiny gilt ones stood around in an in
viting way. T'he table was covered
with magazines, and a handsome book
case was well filled swith the choicest
literature. Everywhere was the evi
dence of refined taste.
Each stand was loaded down with
flowers. Great hardy jacks crowded
out the dainty tea roses, while violets
nestled lovingly in their bed of leaves.
Near the window stood Daisy's favorite
chair, and the second volume of the
book she still held in her hand, thrown
carelessly on the floor, showed she had
left her nook hastily.
As Will took in these details his eye
rested upon Daisy. To him she was
the sweetest picture in the room. Hler
dark, curly hair was pushed carelessly
back from her white forehead, and her
hands were clasped behind her head as
she leaned back in a big chair talking
lazily to Winthrop. One tiny boot was
thrust forward and tapped the floor
gently as she spoke. A few pale roses
were fastened to the white folds of her
collar, and one nestled in the dark
masses of her hair.
Mlr. Garland did not come in until
five o'clock, so although Will had come
intending to stay only an hour, it was
well past six when he walked back to
his hotel. In his mind he saw the
pretty face he had just left.
The next day Mr. Garland left for a
shorsatay at his home in Virginiia.
Will had a cordial invitation to step in
any time and see his daughter. After
his last visit Winthrop thought he had
dlone his duty and stayed away three
whole days. On the fourth hie recon
sidered lur. Garland's invitation, and
on the fifth yielded.
Then began again the old story of
Eve tempting Adam. After his fall
Winshrop was a constant visitor at the
Garland's pretty home. Soon it became
known to every one that the handsome
lieutenant was a suitor for the hand of
the southern beauty. Every day
promptly at two Winthrop would ap
pear on his well-groomed horse, leading
a pretty bay by the bridle. In a few
minutes Daisy would step out in her
stylish habit, and off they would ride.
About two months after Lieut.
Winthrop was sitting in a large arm
chair before the fire and evidently in
deep thought. Suddenly he addressed
the fire thus:
"See here, old man, you're in love.
No use denying it. Here you sit
grumbling and wondering what to do,
and there is only one course for you to
take. Eleaf her heart, she has always
seemed glad to see me whenever I
came, Ye by Ge orge I w il.l try
After making this resolution Will
put on his hat and went out.. Strolling
into the club he found a square white
envelope addressed in the hand lie
knew so well.
"I shall be very glad to have you
spend the evening with us, as papa is
coming home"-so ran 1liss Garland's
note-"and he is to bring a particular
friend. Mr. Lane, to spend a few days
with us"
Will's face flushed with pleasure as
he strode away whistling. Promptly
at seven he was dressed and waiting.
Having some time to spare he threw
himself upon a lounge and lay musing
in the darkness. Now that he was
ready to test his faith he was not quite
so confident.
"Suppose she refuses me? But, great
Scott! she is no coquette, and, then,
hasn't she shown she likes me? Per
haps," but he put the thought aside as
preposterous. No, of course Lane
couldn't be on the same errand as hlinm
self.
At last! The hirl clock sweetly and
clearly rang out eight strokes. It was
time to go. How well he eccalled the
pretty picture Daisy made the first time
he saw her in her own home. iastily,
joyously he mounts the steps of her
house and smiles to hear the resound
ing noise his energetic knock has made.
The door is opened as before by the
trim servant, but this time she shows
him into the parlor at once. Winthrop
never forgot the picture as the draw
ing-room door opened. Daisy was
lounging in an easy chair before the
fire. Near her on a footstool was one
of her most constant visitors, Arthur
Scott.
lane was leaning on the heaviiy
carved mantel, talking easily twitlh
both. The firelight glittered on l)ai.vy's
hai:r bringing out the golden tints and
malting her simple white gown r-s,:y
red. 'his evening she was attired in
a soft white silk, and hearts-ease was
her only ornament-a bunch at her
waist and throat.
As she rises to greet Will he notices
that her eyes are very bright and site
appears very nervous. After speaking
a moment w ith his hostess Will turns
to Lane and both his outstretched
hands are caught in a warm clasp by
him.
A couple of hours passed pleasantlly.
and then Scott rose to go. As soon as
Daisy left the room Hlerbert Lane
turned quickly to Winthrop and ex
claimed:
"Old fellow. you will help me, won't
you? So glad I explained everything
in my letter-saves bother now, and
Daisy is so pleasedr "
TWinthrop stared stupidly at Hlerbert
and gasped: ''What, for heaven's -eke,
{are you driving at? What letter do you
mean? '
It was now Lane's turn to look
anazed. "You don't mean to tell nme
you nreer got my letter? Why, I)ai. y
was always writing hotw kind -you were
to her, and I thought it waas on that ac
count."
"Npeak quickly, Hlerb:" exclaimed
Will. "Before she comes back. How
dare you call her Daisy? What right
have you, I say?"
"Why, iman, the he.st in the world,
for-for she is my wife."
"Your wife? Your-your wisfi?
You're fooling. Herbert, say you are,
for I love her.-"
For a moment he :-poke as if dlazed,
then sank on a chair and covered his
face with his hands. Just then DaisY
appeared in the doorway. She looked
in amazement from one to the other,
then as Will raised his head and she
saw the direst misery in his eyes sho
came swiftly forward.
Iloe sees the face of the girl lie lot--.s,
all her pretty color gone and all her
happiness gone. Will tries to speak,
but Lane comes gently to her and sayi:
";o, Daisy dear, leave him to mne."
Then as Will's face again falls on lhit
bands, she bends softly andl giving
Winthrop one quick kiss hsurries away.
WVhen Daisy had gone, lann t'thl
everything. How he hadloe loved l)ai.
for years, but could not get her father's
consent, until, taking matters into
their own hands, they had mnllarri s
cretly.
When Lane found that 'Mr. (;arland
intended to bring his daughter to Point
Comfort he told Daisy to make friends
with Winthrop and he would write a
litter to Will explaining all. And that
was the letter Winthrop never re
ceived.
But now he (Herbert) had a good po
sition and had come to confess to her
father, and had wanted Will to say a
good word for htim. Daisy was only
too glad to have a friend who knew
her secret, and so showed a mnurked
preference for WVill's society to that of
any of the other men that flocked about
her.
When Lane haad finished, Will stoodl
tip and grasping Herbert's hand:s said
nobly:
"Herb, dear fellow, I will do my best.
Leave ine alone and I will 'see her
father, and congratulate your--your
wife for me."
As Lane left him still sat down and
gazed around wearily. 1 hat bri':ht
dreams had comne and gone ill this little
parlor, but now all was over.
lie touched the bell and ausked to see
Mr. Garland. How he pleaded his
friend's cause, or what he said, I never
knew; however, he must have ilone his
best, for Mri Garland forgave and for
got. The next morning Mrs. Lane sent
a note of invitation to \Winthrop to
spend the day at their house. lie never
came or fgot the note, for he ha:d left
for the north the night before.
When he reached Necw York he wrote
to Daisy, his tirst and last letter, and
that was a note of congratulation. To
Lane he wrote more briefly, as follows::
"'DEat IEirnarET: DO not thinu: I envy you
your happiness, for of all men on earth you

THE PEOPLE'S VERDICT.
low the Republicans Have Ignored the
Country's Interests.
The republicans in 1890. while pre
paring and thrusting upon an unwill
ing people the McKinley abomination.
talked much of the mandate they had
received from the people in 1888, when
a majority of the people voted against
them. No question of raising the tariff
was before the people in 1888. It was
a question of reducing it. and the re
publicans obtained a majority of three
in the house on the subterfuge that the
tariff, while needing revision, ought to
be revised by its friends. Then they
proceeded to reduce the revenues and
to increase the public burdens.
In 1893 the people not only gave the
democratic candilates for the presi
dency and vice presidency a large plu
rality, but gave the democrats a ma
jority of more than ninety in the house
and the control of the senate. These
facts, being a matter of public record,
cannot be denied. But the repub
licans say now that because they held
some republican states last November,
carried a democratic state on local
issues and have lately captured a dem
ocratic district the mandate has been
recalled. This did not prove very ef
fective in the house, but they hope
that it may have better success in the
senate.
Ii the republicans had been guided
by the rule which they now lay down
there would never have beetn a McKin
ley bill to repeal. So far as the man
date of a minority of the people in
18 8 could be tortured into meaning
anything, it was only a permission to
the republicans to reduce the tariff in
btead of having the work done by the
democrats, who, they said, would go
too far if intrusted with the task.
When they were about to pass the Mc
Kinley bill, prominent members of
their own party reproached thenm pri
vately and publicly for their breach of
faith in this respect.
Mlore than this occurred. The elec
tions in November, 1.89. resulted in
sweeping (lemocratie victories Iowa
and Ohio elected democratic governors,
and Massachusetts barely missed doing
so by a bargain in certain wards of
Boston. New TYork. that had voted for
Harrison in 1888, resumed its place in
the democratic column. It was a re
publican Waterloo, only exceeded by
the phenomenal defeats which they
sustained in 18,90 and 18905.
\'as this a revocation of the repub
lican manlate? According to what
they say now, it was. The McKlinley
bill was not yet begun. Congress had
not met. If the republicans are seri
ous now, it was plainly their duty from
their point of view to rive up all notion
of raising tariff rates in order to pro
hibit importations. lut they went on
and framed the McKinley bill. Iron
manaufacturers in New England sent
their mammoth petitions for a restora
tion of the rates of 18.l7, the law which
their Hlenry Wilson said was the best
ever framed. They disregarded this
memorial. Klansas. which had been a
republican stronghold, implored them
not to destroy her smelting and
threatened to desert the party if they
did. a threat that was faithfully carried
cut. Nevertheless, the smelting in
dustry was driven to Mexico. It
would take too long to tell of the pro
tests from other sections that were dis
regarded.
None of these things, nor all of them
together, were tl'cn considered a re
call of the popular mandate. Mc
Kinley and his accomplices insisted
that they were irresistibly driven for
ward by the inandlate of the people to
rob the treasury for the beneeit of
trusts. to redluce the revenue by pro
hibitory dutics ins.tead of lower rates,
and to increase e xpeiditures to an ex
tpult that .w.as sure to lea.l, as it has
led, to a deficit. Such is the history of
republican respect for the mandate of
the people. \'ilth this recent history
fresh in the minds of the people, they
sh,'old have the grace to remain silent
upon the. subject now.- Louisville

A GOOD SUGGESTION.
One Ttay or Improving Republican Elec
torst m etthods.
Theo republicatns have long insisted
that the repr'.entation of the southern
s utes in congrcss and the electoral col
lege ought to be cut down to corre
spond with the relatively small vote
I which they cast in elections, but no
I practicable wey of carrying out the
idea has ever been suggested. But
there is one method of making repre
sentation correspond with ballots
which the party can adopt, and that is
to apportion delegates in national con
ventions with soime reference to the
number of votes cast. The national
committeo is considering the matter,
and seems likely to adopt some plan
before thie convention of 1896 is called.
It seems grossly unjust that states
where the party hardly maintains an
existence, like (;Georgia, should have as
much influlence in selectinfg candidates
as Iowva, four clample. Moreover,. "the
sys;tc.;n of allowing a few managers in
such states to nam- delegates who rep
resent nothing has been fruitful of
scandals, the buying of colored men
having become notorious. It would
be a grcut -gain to, the cause of polit
icaLanorals if retprcenitation in repub
lican conve-ntioim were based upon
rotes rather than upon population.-

A NEW INDUSTRIAL ainA.
Better Conditions Indicated b.v Im.)rnoi s
Legislative onliry.
The passage of the lWilson bill by the
house of representatives by a decisive
majority marks the beginningof a newv
industrial era for the Unitd States.
For the past thirty years the face of
the nation has been turned backward
upon all questions affecting economio
and industrial conditions, and we have
been praising, preaching and prao.
ticing middle age customs in the
treatment of economic and Indne
trial problems so far as they
can be affected by legislation. U nd
such legislative policy prevailed at any
other time than in the latter half of
the nineteenth century, when new in
ventions have caused tremendous ad
vances in mechanics and brought
about material improvements by ac
complishing the division of labor and
the substitution of machinery for the
work of the hands, it would have re
tarded and thwarted the growth of
the nation, would have checked intel
lectual progress if it had not really and
actually produced retrogression. Bnt
the impetus which was given to trade
and commerce by the invention of
steam motor power, and the subse
quent production of mechanical agen
cies, has carried the nation forward as
it were by force and with its back to
the future.
In short. Speaker Crisp was correct
in his statement when he declared that
the protective policy which had been
practiced in the past by the United
States was similar to that which has
kept China stationary and isolated for
the past thousands of years. We have
attempted nothing more nor less than
the building up of a legislative Chinese
wall around the United States. block
ing and impeding commerce and pie
venting the extension of American ip
fluence in other parts of the world.
Had it been continued America woulld
stand a hundred years from to-day as
she does now, and republican politicians
would still be preaching the policy of
protection to her "infant industries."
With twenty years of untrammeled
commerce, beginning with the passage
of the Wilson bill, America will be the
mistress of the world's commerce, trade
and industry. Chairman Wilson cor
rectly described the day of the vote
upon the passage of the Wilson bill as
one of the most glorious in our history.
and that the record of the house of
that day would permanently record no
passing event, but a great epoch in
American history, and that in the
future it would be a matter of pride to
every man who voted for that bill to
point to the record of that day and the
part which he played in its proceed
ings.
In sh, rt, the work of congress,
signalized by the passage of the WVil
son bill, is the result of the triumph of
natural law and human progress. Mc
Kinleyism has retarded and thwarted
the operation of this law for a period,
but the reaction will be all the more
powerful and effective and the prog
ress of the nation henceforth will be
the more rapid for the temporary
check which resulted from the pro
tective policy which, though adminis
tered for half a century or more, is
really but a moment of time in the life
which this great nation is destined to
complete.-Kansas City Times.

The Sugar Trust.
Mr. James HI. Maury bas contributed
to the New York W'orld a startling ar
ray of figures to dlisclose the inward
ness of the sugar trust, which dictated
the McKinley sugar tariff. The trnst
controls rceined sugar. It gets all the
benefit, of the IMcKinley duty on re
fined sugar and gets its material free.
'This trust has an actual capital of $1ST.
740,000 and has unloaded stock on the
market to the amount of #7i,000,000.
As the bond. covered more than the
value of the plant, the stock is all water.
The government bounty of about $10.
00t.0,000 a year roes chiefly to the trust.
Conseqnently the McKinley tariff and
bounty have made the individuals who
dictated them and organized the trust
so enormously rich that they can spend
a million or two to beat the \Wilson
bill. The sugar trust is a formitidable
precursor of the possibilities which
may growv up under tihe domination of
a McKinley party in thil country,~--St

A CHANGE OF NATIONALITY,
Or the Strange Tale or an Invalid Patched
('p Into a Pualgilt.
The city editor of a newspaper which
employs the services ofan enterprising
young man--a friend of mine-to a
small amount, asked him one day to in
vestigate a strange story which had
comne down over the telephone from the
1Fourteenth ward hospital. He gave
the young man an order on the cashier
for his ear fare. Having exchanged
that for ten cents worth of malt ex
tract with a gentleman on W\illiam
street, my friend walked up to the
Fourteenth ward.
lHe passed his credentials in to the
chief surgeon at the hospital and was
admitted.
"What is this case you told us
about?" he asked, borrowing the chief
slurgeon's knife to sharpen his pencil.
"'You haven't made a successful opera
tion, have you?"
"Worse than that." replied the chief
surgeon; "'infinitely worse. A young

The chief surgeon reached behind
himt for his handkercehief and wiped tihe
perspiration off his face with the air
of ai nman whose confidence has been
abused.
"How do you account for the
change?" the reporter asked, recross
ing his legs on the window-sill.
"W\e don't account for it at all," the
chief surgeon answered. '"We can find
nothing in history like it, and only an
autopsy will reveal the secret. I re
gret that we can not perform an autop
sy now. \\'ill you have a cigar?"
"'Thank you ulint how is that"-
A tremendous fall and a wild whoop
of defiance fronm above stairs interrupt
cd the reporter and caused the chief
surgeon to rise and remove his coat.
"'That's him:" he said. "You'll have
to excuse mite for a few minutes. If I
call you, I wish you'd come and assist

'""'hat luau is a real gentleman if he

day last week.
"d'low do youl decide that'?" 1 asked.

TO CURE TOOTHACHE.
t Prescription for Emergency Treatments
That Is Convenient to Know.
Toothache is a little thing in the
books, but many physicians woultl
rather meet a burglar at the door on a
7 dark night than a call to cure a lhad
toothache of several days' continuance.
1 A hypodermic of morphine only post
a pones the evil day, and usually the
Spatient is respectfully referred to the
dentist. 'ihe tooth should not Ihe ex

fliamed and the latter swollen, and it is
Sthe physicians's duty to treat the case
I until the above conditions atre remoaed.
1 Always keep a small phial containing
1the following mixture: ('hloroform,
get. x.; glycerine, girtt. a.: sat. sol. ac.
s carbol., gtt. x.; morphine, gr. j., with a
small wvad of absorbent cotton. if the
Soffending tooth has a cavity or de.-ayed
Ssurface, saturate a small pellet of cot
Â· ton with the above mixture anti plut
a into t'te cavity or against thle dccayed
surface, as the case may be-never pack
the cotton in, or the more is the t:rou
blc, but have the pellet small eno:ugh

Scases this will end the trouble.

-Substitute for Buckwheat Flour.
In many localities buckwheat is very
scarce, hence buckwheat flour is ex
pensive. A mixture of cornmeal and
Gtraham flour makes avery good substi
tute. Set the batter for cakaes over
night using warmn water, salt and yeast
as for buckwheat florr. taking nearly
one cupful of eornrurcal to two of graham
flour. Treat them the same as buck
wheat cakes except bake a little nore
slowly, being careful not to scorch, or
the graham flour will have a raw taste
from not being thoroughly cooked.
These cakes are more healthful than
buckwheat anid niany like them better. *

FLESH-EATING HARES.
The Unbelleving t;ernian Lost Rits let
fWit h the Spaniard.
Ilare is a dish never seen on a Span
ish table, Ie'ecause in Spain there is a
superstition that hares, in the night.
go into churchyards and dig up the
graves a:nd eat the dead bodies. A
writer in the lunLchener Zeitung, swho
recently spent some time shooting in
C'ast ill, where game is very plentiful,
relates how hre , as convinced of the
fact that hares do eat flesh. lie had
been told so by the country people. but
had treated their assertion as a ridlicn
lous fiction. l'he next time he found
himself in a party of sportsnlen lie re
peated what he had heard as a joke;
but, to his surprise, every one listened
quite gravely, and assured him that it
a was perfectly true: they themselves
had frequently seen hares eating flesh.
As he still expressed doubts on the sub
I ject, however, one of the company of
t fered to bet him fifty litres of wine
I that lie (the (German) should see a hare
eating meat. The het was accepted.
Tihe next morning very early, the
a Spaniard, the German and two gray
e hounds went out to a great heath to
- look for flesh-eating hares. As they
were sitting waiting for the hares to
a appear, the Spaniard. to the Gtrman's
a amazement, took a little live crab out
of his pocket. "'What do you want
that for"" said thie G(;erman. "To
catch the hare with.' replied the
. paniard. It struck the ;erman that
+ perhaps the Spaniard had brought him
ou ct merely to make a fool of him. But
I then he reflected that that was not the
- Spanish way with strangers: so he
t held his tongue and went on wait

- were after him (they were well mun
Szied. so that they could not do him any
t fIarm), and. in a few moments more the
hare had disappeared again in his hole,
- and the dogs were barking at its mouth.
- The men got up and hurried after them.
- "Now," said the Spaniard, "this is
a where my crab comes in." He pulled
I out the crab and put it down aft the
Smouth of the hole, and it, glad to hide *
Sin the dark shade, crept in with all the
Sexpedition it could manage. The
Spaniard instantly spread a large
Scoarse sack over the entrance, and in a
few momnents out rushed the hare, ter
a rifled by its unexpected visitor, right
! into the sack. Hlome they went with
r their prisoner, which they placed in a
Scage. When the hare had recovered
Sfrom his fright, hlie ate, before the Ger-
man's astonished eyes, several pieces
