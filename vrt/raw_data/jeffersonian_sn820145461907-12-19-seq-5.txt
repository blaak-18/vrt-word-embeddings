OLD FARMER COMES AGAIN.
Dear Sir: *"
How any one can read Mr. Ross’s
paper in the Weekly Jeffersonian of
November 28 and the many editorials
from your own pen upon the same
and kindred subjects and not see
that our Government has got entire
ly away from the Democracy of Jef
ferson, Lincoln, et al., is more than
I know.
A failure in the mighty struggle
now pending for the control of this
Government would mean that we are
little better than eighty million serfs,
except for the right of revolution,
which is always with us. It is com
mon now in the Trust papers, and
they own nearly all of them, to refer
to “The Peepul” as a great joke.
The express companies are merely
barnacles upon the railroads, railroad
employes doing all the work, except
distribution. The great number of
private car lines are other barnacles
and if the railroads were honestly
managed they would cry out for the
public, or the Government, to help
brush them off. The only conclusion
■ est is that the individual owners of
the railroads above the management,
share in these extortions, the public
paying the score.
If “The Interests” through their
alliance with the thieves who We in
power in California at the time of the
so-called Japanese school troubles,
helped by their treasonable intrigues
with the “Jingoes” of Japan, could
have caused serious trouble with that
country, our greatest danger would
have been whether armor plate, guns,
et cetera, made by “protected” indus
tries might not have been found de
fective in action. But; we would
have libraries and large contributions
to the Peace Congress. Without fur
ther instances the truth is that we
are almost overwhelmed with graft,
and disregard of law. These people
say over their wine that they do not
fear “The Peepul,” that they can
hire any one part of them to betray
the other.
They used also to say that when
ever they wanted anything in your
beautiful Southland they dangled a
“nigger” in your face and by the
time you were through chasing him
they had what they wanted.
This statement has been modified
since the successor to Calhoun failed
to even cause a ripple, with his ti
rades against the “nigger,” added to
the close finish of their own John
Sharp Williams in the recent elec
tion.
It seems to me that the country
needs patriots more than place hunt
ers, that it is vital that the pirates
be first driven, from the ship, after
that patriotism will point the way.
All know Mr. Roosevelt to be hon
est, and it takes ten times the courage
tn face the things he meets every day
that it took to walk up San Juan hill
twirling a cane. He is beset on ev
ery hand by traitors and spies, every
weekly paper in the country using
“patent outside” has articles on
the first page lauding Hughes, since
he “Jeromed” (this is a modern
name for Golden Calf).
You don’t find your publications
(or any other man’s who says what
he thinks) on the railroadt, and rare
ly at news stands.
In ths last issue of the paper
“founded by Ben Franklin,” Mr.
Archbold makes a statement for the
Standard Oil ''Co. that in most ways
would appeal to all of us, if it was
simply a part of the commercial en
terprise of the country drawing its
powers from the Government, and
obeying the laws thereof.
Mr. Archbold must be ignorant of
many things of common report con
cerning his company. It is believed
that the Standard Oil crowd control
two-thirds of the railroads of- the
country, that they own or dominate
a large part of the banks and trust
companies in financial centres, it is
believed that they control the United
States Senate and possibly the House
of Representatives. It is believed
that after they knocked out Gates
and Heinze, they caused the
banks and trust companies with
Gates and Heinze affiliations, to be
put out of business and to “discip
line” the President forced the coun
try to the basis of clearing house cer
tificates; also that they are hoarding,
either here or in large balances
abroad, ten times more money than
all the p?>ple.
It is believed that they are now
further depleting the circulation by
causing their agents in nearly every
hamlet in the United States to remit
total receipts in cash direct to their
office in New York by express.
It is believed that it is their pur
pose to force the nation to its knees,
even as they forced the state of Mon
tana under peril of starvation, to call
a special session of the Legislature
and pass a law drawn at 26 Broad
way.
A special plea is made for his
company by Mr. Archbold on account
of its Pension System. We have
taught our children that this is the
land of the Free, of opportunity,
where a lifetime of labor and fru
gality meant a competence, not a
Pension. What is left of the Demo
cratic party, is controlled by the Ry
ans, Belmont, Whitney, etc., who are
a part of the same combinations, at
least they are always found behind
the same breastworks. Therefore is
it not the part of patriotism and
wisdom that you, the Hon. Thos. E.
Watson, invite Mr. Hearst, Folk,
Wm. Allen White, Cummins of lowa,
Tom Johnson, Deneen of Illinois, La-
Follette, Hardaman, Glenn, Comer,
Broward, let Mr. Bryan come if he
wants to, and many others .kiat you
know, to meet with you to consider
ihe state of the c mntry ? It is be
lieved by many that the result of
this meeting will be first, to ?ny to
Mr. Roosevelt, “You owe it to your
country to continue the fight; if you
do so we will hold up your hands.”
I! he will not do o, put aside per
sonal ambition, likes or dislikes, and
all work together to save the country
for it is in peril.
AN OLD FARMER.
There was an aged Irishman on a
Peachtree street car the other day
Lnid h pipe in his mouth. The
conductor told him he could not
smoke, but he paid no heed. Pres
ently the conductor came into the car
and exclaimed. with a show T of irri
tation: “Didn’t I tell you, yon
couldn’t smoke on this car?” “Well,
Oi’m not smoking.” “You’ve got a
pipe in your mouth, haven’t you?”
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
“So Oi have me feet in me boots,
but Oi’m not walking.”
FROM JUDGE JOHN J. HUNT.
Charles D. Barney, banker, in Sat
urday Evening Post, under the
heading, “A Foe to Capital,” says:
“Mr. Roosevelt is not a man of finan
cial training, and yet he does not
seem to take the advice of trained
financiers, or men among his own per
sonal following who are qualified to
judge in such matters.’ So, we see,
men must have special training and
be qualified. In other words the class
that now has the monopoly of issuing
money also has a monopoly of finan
cial wisdom and the exclusive privil
ege besides of advising.
In Clearing House Certificates we
have now the worst sort of State Bank
money, absolutely irredeemable as
money should be redeemable. To be
sure these certificates will be re
deemed in time in National Bank
Notes or other good currency, and no
one wants National Bank Notes re
deemed, because the Government is
behind them. Yes, and if you will
back Georgia State Bank money, or
Texas State Bank money, each by its
State, nobody will want it redeemed;
but if they should, the State will pro
vide for its redemption. It has been
forgotten by many that an Augusta
(Ga.) Bank, which went through the
Civil War, its bills during that period
passing as other depreciated curren
cy, paid the face value of those hills
in legal tender money some rears aft
er the close of the war. Whv? Be
cause there happened to be a strong
law protecting that currency.
There are State Banks as good and
as solvent as National Banks, and
there is no reason why they should
be denied the facility of furnishing
the public with good money. It is
already conceded that the high price
of Government Bonds precludes State
Banks from being nationalized, and
those that are from issuing money
enough for the country’s needs.
The whole argument against State
Bank Currency reduced to its last
analysis is that either the money will
not be good, or, the privilege of is
suing money should vest exclusively
in a class. No one will have the gall
to say any class should have exclusive
privilege of furnishing the life blood
of a great Nation, which is Money.
In one of the late National Demo
cratic Conventions (it seems to have
been forgotten), there was a plank
demanding the repeal of tax on
State Banks of issue. Strange to say,
Democrats in Congress, mostly New
York Democrats, afterward fought
it and defeated it when it was sought
to be made a law. New York Demo
crats, it may be remarked byway of
digression, can be relied on to ignore
platform promises.
Everybody knows the National
Bank Law was a war measure and
tended more than any single act of
legislation to produce centralization
in Government. Its further effect,
as evidenced by the present so-called
panic is to centralize money, congest
it in Wall Street.
The fact that up to this time no
Congressman, not even the President,
has ventured to suggest practical re
lief, looks to me like they are con
vinced that the Money Issuing Pow-
er only are capable of thinking on
such a subject.
GET TOGETHER, DEMOCRATS.
The rank and file of the democratic
party have usually stood very well to
gether, but this has infrequently been
true of democratic leaders.
It will not soon be forgotten in the
South that when the southern and
northern democrats came harmonious
ly together under the leadership of
Grover Cleveland, and not only elect
ed the big New Yorker to the presi
dency but sent a good working major
ity into both branches of congress,
the leaders, both in and out of con
gress, instead of standing together
both for the country’s and the par
ty’s good, got hopelessly apart, ren
dering future party success almost
impossible and succeeded in enacting
no very significant legislation, to com
mend the party to the future favora
ble consideration of ths American
voters.
But Governor Hoke Smith during
a recent visit to New York, anent
the present political situation, said
some things that are worthy of very
serious consideration. We quote him
as follows:
“National politics are chaotic. The
more I look at it the more chaotic
the situation appears. Ido not know
how things will develop. I do know
that there is a sentiment among
southern democrats for concerted ac
tion. The south does not mean to
be treated any longer as if it were in
a state of secession. Southern demo
crats are just as loyal as any others.j
“There is no one in the south now’
who wants the democratic president
tial nomination, but if the South had
a candidate of its own, I think the
southern democrats would not hesi
tate to support him in the conven
tion.
The feeling is general among the]
southern democrats that they must dal
their own thinking in national affairs
and not merely accept what others]
have thought for them.
“The feeling is that the time has]
come for southern democrats to aca
together and take part in the leader!
ship of the party.”—Vienna News.
