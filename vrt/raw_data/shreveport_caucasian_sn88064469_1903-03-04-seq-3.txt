THOUGHT A WIFE.
" ody of a Woman Found at New Albanu
May Be Mrs.. unpp.
New Albany, Ind., March 4.-Al
though Edward F. Kitng failed to posi
tively identify the boA~~f the woman
found in the rftire here as that of his
wife's silter and wife of Alfred Knapp,
the impression is strong that the body
of that of one of Knapp's victims.
After being removed to the undertak
ing establishment of Shrader Bros., at
118 West Main street, New Albany, the
body was embalmed and to a greater
extent recovered its natural color. De
composition has set in. Mr. King in
examining minutely the jewelry found
in an ear and the bruise above the
knee, declares the body to be that of
Hannah Goddard Knapp.
The matter of identification is ex
tremely difficult. The body is green
from long exposure to water, there is
no hair on the head and the body is
nude, esve for a stocking on each leg.
It is believed" that it is the body of
Hannah Goddard Knapp, and that it
was put in a rough box and thrown
into the Miami river at Hamilton,
Ohio, Dec. 22. It floated on out of the
Miami and into the Ohio and down
past Louisville, where it rose to the
surface and was discovered.
In her ears were found gold wire ear
rings, and on the third finger of the
left hand an embossed ring with three
little birds and an owl. On her legs
were black stockings, and on her right
leg, just above the ankle, was a dark
bruise.
In every particular the body of the
floater was found to tally with the mi
nute description of his wife given by
Knapp in his confession.
SSay Her Life Is Threateaed.
Cincinnati, March 4.-hMrs. Edward
F. King, sister of Alfred A. Knapp, has
reported that her life has been repeat
edly threatened by another woman in
terested in Knapp's defense, and she
asked for protection, which was ac
corded her.

ROME IN GALA ATTIR
d Thousands Gather to Do Honor tV
Lt Pope Leo Xlll.
n SILVER ANNIVERSARY
0 St. Peter's Cathedral Packed by Pee.
pie From Various Nations of the
e Globe, Among Them One
Thousand Americans.
Rome, March 4.-From sunrise yes
terday all Rome was on the alert and
- showing most unusual animation and
interest in the celebraton of the twesa
ty-fifth anniversary of the coronation
of Pope Leo XIII. This movement
was especially noticeable at the large
hotels, which were Illuminated as
though for a ball. An idea of the anum
ber of people congregating at the
i Vatican could be formed by the fact
that it was utterly impossible to get a
carriage if the vehicle had not been
ordered Monday, especially as it was
raining, and the scene on the piazza of
St. Peter's was maniftoent. There was
assembled many hundreds of Italian
troops in various modern uniforms,
making a striking contrast with the
1 old time costumes of Swiss Pap.i
guards on duty at the bronse deers It
the cathedral The crowds, which gath.
ered before the first cordon of tregt
were impatient as they stood drippla
under the persistent rain. There van
a great clashing of umbrellas and gen
eral feeling of discomfort among wnal
nag sightseers, who included veer
many women in most varied attr'e,
comprising foreigners of all natlonalt
ties and Italians from all parts ea the
world. The uniforms of the erwd
were pleasantly broken by pgeng oe
dlsten Is diforent gowns at thebt .
Ifm, Ckthelle studeate and plet-u"
aNl attired friars.
Wheo Inaily the deers at It. aDte

Isatmlr at the sared editee, while 6n
all ade were heard cries ofat fer he
imnreetls spt very suited to a spit
where the nale religious cereomey
was about to bsgia. Onee Iaside the
4e64"W ladies whe were lace gser
sees see ass
found them to be n ba4 condition, abd
some women were carried away In
tainting condition. The tribunes were
soon crowded to overflowing and all'ot
the best standing places taken. A be
riod of comparatively calm succeeded
this great rush and attention of the
people attracted to the gilded thrope.
Near the altar the immense plll-rs
of the basilica were hung' with red
silken draperies. Some of the tribut.es
on each of the altars were filled with
men and women blasing with decora
tions. In the group of royal parsna
ages were Crown Princess Victoria oi
Sweden and Norway, Countessa Ma
thilde of Trani of the Bourbon-Naples
famlly, the Grand Duchess of Sate.
Welmar, Duke of Robert Patras,
Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg, Prince
Liechtenstein and Prince Maailisa of
Baxony.
In a special tribune was the pope's
family, diplomatic corps and members
of the Order of Malta, all in ful uni
form.
After an hour of very fatiguing
waitlng the majestic procession began
to appear. It was composed of great
dignitaries of the church, forty-ive
uardinals being present In gasgese
red robes, this alone maklng the me.t
Imposltg characteristles and gI

city seemed to pause for a moment.
fats were raised and the sign of the
cross made. Shortly afterwards inside
It. Peter's-eilver trumpe".tlared out
their message and the pantiff appear
ed. The people held their breath for
a moment,. and then all pent up en.
thustiasm burst forth In a tremendous
roar of welcome.
From his elevation in the new seia
leetatorla, carried by twelve men, the
pope apIeared to be more than a hu
man being. He seemed to be white is
Spirit, this impression being added to
by the pontiff's white robe and white
mitre, his thin hand moving slowly Is
the benediction. As the pope proee-se
ad. thetsands of voices shouted, 'I-ug
lve Pope Leo," handkerchlefs fluttera
la the air, banners of various socleties
raved and many of those present were

loudly, while others fainted from ex
