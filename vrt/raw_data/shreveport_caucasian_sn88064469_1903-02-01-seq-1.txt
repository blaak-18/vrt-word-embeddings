THE DAVIS MONUMENT
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITVTEE
REQUESTS ORDERS.
Sets of Plates Typifying the Three
Branches of Military Service-The
Cavalryman. the Infantryman
and the Artilleryman.
Mrs. N. V. Rapdolph, chairman of
the central committee of the Jefferson
Iavis Monument Association, Rich
mond, Va., has sent the circular which
follows to the Confederate workers of
New Orleans, whom she hope4 to inter
est in its announcement. The circular
says:
"The central committee of the Jeffer
son Davis Monument Association has in
press a set of three plates, representing
the three branches of the Confederate
army. These plates are executed in the
best style of colored work, from de
signs in water color, .by William L.
Sheppard. Mr. Sheppard's service in the
Confederate army afforded him idvant
ages in the study of types, places and
color in the life of the Confederate sol
dier which were possessed by only a few
artists.
"The figures are treated with almost
no background, and only a few acces
sories appropriate to the branch of the
service represeited.
"The cavalryman is about to saddle
his horse; has the bridle in his hand,
while the saddle is on a limb near by,
and near it lie his rolled blanket. and
saber.
"The infantryman is equipped with
rolled blanket ;over his shoulder, belt,
bayonet, canteen, etc. He has stopped
for a moment at the vamp fire to light
his'pipe, and supports his rifle in the
hollow 'of his elbow, in order to have
bob hands.free.
P'The ardtleryman is an odicer. &e

The death of Mr. Stephen B. Pugh,
which occurred at. his residence near
Dona postffice in the third ward, last
}Saturday, was a calamity to his imnmedi-
ate neikhbors and is deeply regretted byl
Sall who knew the deceased gentleman.
,Agiwas an dd citizen of our prt
Sis. and a goadd one. in every sense of the
word. He was -a farmer and, since comn
1:i,. to the parish, has lived continumously
near where he died. He was a consistent
mebieer of the Bapt1 cherdk and was
Sgoverned by the principle of letting his
-acts speak for his religion. He was the
friend xf the rich and the poor, the
white and the black, the old. and the
young. His illness was of long dura
tion, but he awaited the dread summons
with patience, fortitude and Christian
resignation. The good deeds, done by
him will live long in the memory of the
recipients.--Mansfield Journal;

The directors of the Business Worm
en's Home held a metting last week at
which w'as discussed plans for further
ing the objects of the promoters and
to attend to business matters connected
therewith. Another meeting will be held

formation from a similar home in Nash
ville, Tenn.:
Secretary of Business Women's Ex
change, Shreveport, La.-Dear Dadam:
Yours ,of the 5th was received by" the
ladies of the Girls' Cliristina Hose, and
as their see.etary, I write to gite you
the information asked for.
The Wor&king, Women's 'rEtange
sand Girls' Christian Home, as e r in.ai

on ladies, reprqsenting the dfierent
6testair deOt inatioQs. We alsoAids

Under separate cover I send you a
copy of the rules. Of course-these have

case, but they are generally adhered to.
We give the matron authority to settle
any dispute that may arise among .the
inmates, and we uphold her in her de

SENTENCE COMMUTED.
If Ambrose Johnson was not "born
e to be hanged" he will go to the pen for
life. I-e is rejoicing. His commutation is
due to the untiring efforts of his attor
neys, Mr. J. B. Slattery and Mr. E. D.
f Mills. Some theorists would assert that
life servitude is the greatest punish
t ment. If so, why is it that every mur
f derer reprieved from hanging and then
commuted to life servitude is full of re
joicing? What is needed is a' few first
class legal hangings. Think of four
murder cases being on the docket for
trial during the week and others not
1 listed !
