Pills. Why not do so.
They will relieve the
pain in just a few min
utes. Ask your druggist
There are 45,000 druggists
in the U. S. Ask any of
them. A package of 25
doses costs 25 cents. One
tablet usually stops a
headache. They relieve
pain without leaving any
disagreeable after-effects
—isn’t that what you
want?
"My son Frank Snyder has used
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Fain Pills for a long
time. He never had anything to
help him so much for headache. A
year ago he came home, and I was
down sick with such a dreadful nerv
ous headache. He gave nje one of
the Anti-Pain Pills, and after while
I took another and was entirely re
lieved. I always keep them in the
house now, and gave many away to
others suffering with headache.”

FARM AND RANCH, Dallas, Texas,
treaties with foreign countries which
would broaden the markets for cotton
and by increasing the demand raise
the price of cotton. Instead of this,
all our treaties are made with refer
ence to the manufacturer. An instance
of this, and a very striking one, was
given when the senate rejected the
Kasson treaty, in which France
agreed to such terms as would have
enabled us to sell her each year $20,-
000,000 worth of cotton seed oil . In
this treaty it was provided, however,
that France should have a slightly
lower duty on cotton hosiery. It
so happened that one New England
mill was engaged in the manufacture
of stockings in that sort, and rather
than submit to a reduction of its
profit, this New England mill made a
fight upon the Kasson treaty and
knocked it out. In other words, the
government sacrificed the entire
south to preserve the monopoly of
one little New England mill.
Where South is to Blame.
♦
“For the position in which she
finds herself the south is much to
blame. We have a natural monopoly
in cotton and haven’t got sense
enough to know what to do with it.
The steel trust has a monopoly built
up by bribery and all sorts of wrong,
but it knows how to use it. It says
to the farmer: ‘Pay my price for ag
ricultural implements of all kinds of
your farm can grow up in scrub pines
and jack rabbits. The harvester trust
has its price and the grain may fall
in the field if the farmer is unwilling
to pay tribute in order to get the
scythe, the plow, the mower, the reap
er and the harvester, which this same
harvester trust will sell to the South
ern American or Russian competitor
of the American farmer at a very
much smaller price than the Ameri
can farmer is made to pay. The meat
packers have their price and the av
erage citizen must pay it or must sit
down to a meal of white side meat,
black molasses and corn bread, seas
oned with hopes of roast beef, veal
cutlets and beefsteak which he may
enjoy in the sweet by and bye. The
coal trust has its price, fixed by
George Baer, the divine right capital
ist, who, on being asked by a report
er if it was true that he did fix the
price of coal, said angrily that it was
nobody’s business whether he fixed
the price or not, and it was nobody’s
business what the price was.
“But the farmer, having a real,
God-given monopoly, lets his rivals in
business take from him all the advan
tage it gives him. For instance, in
1907, we sold abroad 9,703,000 bales
of cotton. We were paid for it
$481,000,000.
“European spinners manufactured
this raw cotton and sold the goods
for $1,400,000,000, a net profit of
more than $900,000,000. This certain
ly would seem to show that we do
not get enough for our cotton. The
Pee Dee mills of North Carolina have
declared 40 per cent dividends right
straight along for the past ten years,
panic or no panic,.and the stock of
these mills cannot be bought at 5 for
1. This would seem to show that
the Pee Dee mills do not pay the
farmer a fair price for his cotton.
Mills Make too Much Profit.
“Two years ago I secured some
inside information concerning the
"sb* -Jeffersonian
mills in Augusta, Ga. My informant
assured me that at a cost of SIOO,
including what was paid for the raw
cotton at 12 cents a pound, 3,000
yards of calico could be made out of
a 500-pound bale of cotton. If the
mills sold this calico at 5 cents per
yard, a bale of cotton, which cost
them S6O, yielded them in manufac
tured form $l5O, a profit of SSO on
the bale. If they only got 4 cents
per yard for calico, that netted them
S2O per bale on cotton.
“A Griffin, Ga., mill makes a bath
towel that weighs 1 pound, and which
retails in Atlanta for sl. The whole
sale price of the towel is 75 cents.
It probably takes more than 1 pound
of cotton to make 1 pound of towel,
but not much more. Consequently
the way in which a pound of cotton,
costing from 9 to 12 cents, can be
turned into a bath towel costing 75
cents, would seem to show that the
farmer is not getting a fair price for
his cotton.
“Why, then, the glut of the mar
ket with unsold cotton goods? First,
because our high tariff charges pro
voked retaliatory tariffs aimed at us
by other nations. Thus we are shut
out of foreign markets, to a great
degree, and the cotton market of the
world is thus narrowed. A narrow
ing of the market, of course, means
restriction of consumption, and a re
striction of consumption means a les
sening demand. Lessening demand,
in turn, means falling price. The
second reason is that because the peo
ple have not the money with which
to buy these high-priced cotton goods.
“Now, the remedies: First of all
is the constitutional remedy. The
tariff on cotton goods should be lower
so that everything entering our mar
ket that is cheaper in price, would,
by the competition thus established
in the American market, force the
American manufacturer to reduce his
price to meet the competition. The
lower the price, the greater the
amount of consumption. The greater
the amount of goods the people can
buy, the greater the amount of raw
cotton the factories will have to pur
chase. Os course as the demand for
raw cotton advances, the price will
naturally rise. That method, however,
requires time and pressure upon con
gress. Consequently it does not meet
the immediate necessities of the case.
Coffee Trust’s Remedy.
“We should deal with the present
situation as the coffee trust dealt
with their surplus a few years ago.
They found the country could only
take about 16,000,000 bags annually.
The trust found itself in possession
of a surplus of 14,000,000 bags. They
simply retired that surplus from the
market, and kept it off from year to
year. They fed to the demand the
16,000,000 bags which it needed. This
not only kept up the price at the old
figure, but advanced it 3 or 4 cents
per pound. Thus during the years
when they were holding a surplus of
the market, they were making the
people pay for it in the advance of
the price on the 16,000,000 bales that
were sold. The same principle could
and should be applied to the surplus
of cotton.
“Second, some relief might be giv
en by a trial of the cotton certificate
plan. It is well known that I do not
