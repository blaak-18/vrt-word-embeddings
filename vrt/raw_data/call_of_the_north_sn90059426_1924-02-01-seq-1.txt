Makes Big Sensation.
BULLETIN
( Special to the Call of The North)
New London, Minn—lt is alleged
that the raid on the stag party here
the other night which resulted in sen
sational arrests was brought about
by information sent by New London
Klangmen.
—K-K-K
Sheriff Peter Bonde received a call
from New London on last Saturday
evening from an unknown party (a
lady’s voice), that a drunken party
was taking place in the municipally
owned auditorium at New London.
Sheriff Peter Bonde and Deputy
Sheriff Olson hurried by car to New
London. They parked their car
about a block from the auditorium and
from the noise that was being made
did not need to be told where the dis
turbance was taking place.
They investigated things at the
building and found that all doors
were locked but the officers had pa
tience and waited until after midnight
Some of the members who were at
tending the ball made trips to and
from the building. At first great care
was taken to see that all doors were
locked after them, but the occupants
Boon grew careless and finally left the
door wide open.
The men then entered the building
and the first man that the sheriff
met and talked to had a two gallon
jug of moonshine in his hand which
he quickly turned over to the sheriff.
To the sheriff’s surprise he found a
number of intoxicated persons in the
place including members of the village
council, justice of peace, town clerk,
village recorder and the constable.
The constable was put away to sleep
on a table in the kitchen.
After the sheriff entered the build
ing there was a hurried exodus of
those who were in condition to run.
One of these was stopped by an of
ficer on the outside who fired a pistol
shot over the fleeing man’s head.
This proved to be a State appointee.
Those who remained in the auditorium
l
quieted down and were given a
straight-from-the-shoulder talk by the
Sheriff about the gravity of the of
fense they had committed and what
was their duty to do as citizens.
The liquor that was left in the build
ing was given to the sheriff by one of
the members o fthe party and is now
in the sheriff’s office. Among those
present were two Roscoe citizens,
Mike Neirenhauser and Mike Butala.
It was Roscoe moonshine that had
been imported for this function. The
officials stayed on the scene until 4
o’clock Sunday morning and there
were still a number of the participants
in the hall when they left for home.
Sheriff Bonde later secured a num
ber of affidavits covering all the de
tails of the affair which will be pre
sented as evidence to the State for
action. The offense of the officials
participating in this drinking party,
is a serious one under the law. Any
official who had knowledge of the
bringing in of liquor and who ac
quiesced in the crime is subject (or
his bondsman) to a heavy fine and to
removal from office.
The affair was staged as a fire
man’s ball or banquet. There were no
women in attendance but the men
indulged in stag dancing to the music
of a piano. Impromptu wrestling
matches were put on. The party had
evidently been viewed by other citi
sens of New London village for the
•erifTs party found a ladder up
against the end of the building from
which ladder a view could be had of
the interior through a high window.

Missing in Theatre At Deca

Un-American Act Causes Great In
flux to Klan Ranks—lndignation
Rampant in Adams County.
—K-K-K
DECATUR, Ind.—No arrests has
followed the theft of portions of a
moving picture machine from the
Mecca threatre in this city when
thieves are said to have entered the
playhouse and stolen certain parts of
the projecting machine which made
impossible the showing of a Klan
photoplay entitled “The Traitor With
in” and which was scheduled to be
shown here on last Thursday and
Friday nights. A note left by the
vandals givs evidence that the act was
that of aliens and the act was in keep
ing with the tactics being employed
by enemies of the Ku Klux Klan.
Threats that serious damage would
be done if the management permitted
any more “K. K. K. pictures” was
contained in the missive which read:
“These parts will be returned by
Saturday provided no more K. K. K.
pictures are shown in Decatur, but
next time it will be more serious.”
No Attempt to Prosecute
The parts taken are valued at
about SIOO.OO, and, according to local
newspapers, the management as
serted that no attempt would be
made to prosecute the person who
took the parts if they were returned.
The parts, it is understood were re
turned to the Crystal theatre on
Saturday night and it is said that
the management of the Mecca theatre
“has a good idea who took them.”
At the time of theft the persons
who had leased the theatre at
tempted to persuade the manage
ment to let them use a portable ma
chine. This was refused it is un
derstood, because of certain fire
regulations. The picture was then
taken to Bluff ton, Indiana, and
shown at a playhouse in that city.
The reels were recently completed
and have been shown at other cities
in the state. Part of the picture was
filmed at Fort Wayne during the big
armistice celebration held by the
Klan there. A great part of the mag
nificient parade at that place is
shown in the film.
The un-American act has created
great excitement here which has re
bounded greatly to the benefit of the
Klan and as a result it is understood
that a great influx of members had
resulted. The proof brought home to
the many staunch Americans in
Adams county, that the rights of
Americans are being infringed upon
and that an organization such as is
the Klan is needed in America at
this time, has caused a rush to the
ranks of the Klan.
Many hundreds of persons were
disappointed when it was found that
a performance was not possible and
this added to the resentment felt by
many persons. That the act of the
aliens who perpetuated the deed act
ed as a boomerang is conceded here
by many who formerly were not
friendly to the Klan. The great num
ber of applications which have been
received at Klan headquarters since
the act of un-Americanism plainly
shows, it is said, the temper of Amer
icans at this time.
While the theft has re-acted great
ly to the benefit of the Klan organ
ization in Adams county, Klansmen
regret very much that such an inci
dent should occur in this county.
It could not be learned today
whether or not a further attempt
would be made to «how the picture
in this city.

(Bureau of Publication and Education)
Washington, D. C., Jan. 24.—Did
you ever try to borrow $100,000? It’s
easy, if you happen to have old-time
friends who love you and who want
to help you.
But say, it’s ten times easier to
make such a loan if you just hap
pen to be in a position of influence
where something under your juris
diction is desired by the fellow who
has the big cash. He will hand it
right over to you, especially if he
has known you all of his life, if he
loves you dearly and wants to help
you if you are down and out—but
don’t forget you must be in a posi
tion to kick through something he
wants and when he wants it. You
will get the loan quicker that way.
Judging from what the country has
heard from Washington this week in
the Teapot Dome investigation,
former Secretary of the Interior Fall,
of New Mexico, has had no trouble
at all to tie into SIOO,OOO loans. In
fact he has had two of them thrust
on him by old friends who love him
"in recent years. At least so the
testimony shows.
First, the country heard about Ed
ward B. McLean, the Washington and
Cincinnati publisher, loaning SIOO,OOO
to Mr. Fall. That was just a little
helping hand extended but it seems
that money was never used but ac
cording to testimony was returned to
Mr. McLean. In fact, it seems now
that Mr. Fall didn’t need the money
at all for the same amount has now
bobbed up from another source.
Edward L. Doheny, multi-million
aire oil magnate, testified today be
fore the Teapot Dome committee that
jhe had loaned SIOO,OOO to former
Secretary of the Interior Albert B.
Fall on November . 30, 1921. The
statement was made in explanation
of the mysterious SIOO,OOO loan,
which has figured so prominently in
the Teapot Dome investigation, and
which led Senatorial accusers of Fall
to charge that it formed a part of
the “corrupt consideration” which
they alleged Fall received as a result
of leasing Teapot Dome to Harry F.
Sinclair.
Mr. Doheny declared to the com
mittee that he made this loan to Fall
personally and the money did not
belong to any oil company in which
he is interested. He said that during
■negotiation of the loan there was
no discussion of any contract be
tween the government and any of
the Doheny oil interests and that the
loan had no relation to any subse
quent transaction relating to oil
leases. He said Fall gave him a
promissory note for the amount of
money he loaned him.
Mr. Doheny appeared before the
committee as a voluntary witness and
talked freely and unhesitatingly as
a witness. He answered a rapid fire
of questions fully and without reserve.
Mr. Doheny, whose oil interests in
California and Mexico exceed those
of any other American, seemed to
want to enlighten the Senate com
mittee for his own sake and for the
sake of his friend Fall. The purpose
of the loan to Fall was to enable the
former cabinet member to enlarge
his ranch holdings in New Mexico.
Doheny said he came all the way
from Los Angeles to give this in
formation to the committee of his own
accord and that he travelled via New
Orleans to apprise Fall of his inten
tion and Fall was in full accord with
his purpose.

ACTION BRANDED BY CITIZENS AS A
VICTORY FOR LUMBER INTERESTS
LAFOLLETTE DEMANDS
LOWER FREIGHT RATES
He Offers a Resolution for Charges
on Crops and Farm Supplies at
Pre-War Leved.
—KKK—
Washington, Jan. 19.—Senator La
Follette introduced a joint resolution
in the Senate directing the Interstate
Commerce Commission to proceed im
mediately to reduce freight rates on
agricultural products and on mate
rials and implements required on
f rms to the pre-war level.
The resolution charges that rates
on grain, livestock and other agricul
tural products from country shipping
points to primary markets are now 47
per cent in excess of the pre-war
level, while rates on grain for export
have been increased by apporximate
ly 73 per cent.
Although the value of farm prod
ucts has decreased, freight rates re
main, Senator LaFollette declares,
substantially on the levels established
when wheat was selling at $2 a bush
el, corn at $1.86 a bushel, and cotton
at 37 cents a pound. It now requires
the value of 166 bqshels of wheat to
"buy an ordinary wagon, he says,
as compared with 102 bushels in 1913.
“In addition,” Senator LaFollette
says, “American farmers have suf
fered from increases in every ele
ment of the cost of production, in
cluding taxes, so that they face heavy
net losses on their entire production.”
It isfurther asserted that data of
the Department of Ogricu’ture shows
that in 1922 more than 2,000,000 per
sons moved from farms into cities,
and that because of conditions in the
agricultural districts young children
are being employed in ever increas
ing numbers to perform the work of
grown farm hands. Existing condi
tions, declares Senator LaFollette,
“constitute an emergency which re
quires immediate action if American
agriculture is to be spared from ap
palling disaster.”
MICHIGAN FAVORS
OREDON SCHOOL LAW
Attempt Is Being Made to Compel
All Childlren to Attend Free Pub
lic Schools.
—KKK—
Washington, D. C.—Three years
ago Michigan oast 353,817 votes in
favor of sending all pupils to public
schools. This year a renewed attempt
is being made to change the state
constitution to include these sections:
“From and after August 1, 1925,
all children residing in the state of
Michigan, between the ages of seven
years and sixteen years, shall at
tend a public school until they have
graduated from the eighth grade.
“The legislature shall enact all
necessary legslation to render this
section effective.”
The opposition to this proposition
is well organized, since Catholic,
Lutheran and private schools of all
sorts, representing a huge invest
ment in property as well as thou
sands of votes, are against it. The
general sense of the people of Michi
gan, however, seems to favor a uni
versal use of the public schools, and
the supreme court of the state is
now being invoked to pass upon the
constitutionality of laws which
friends of the amendment say pre
vent the question being brought be
fore the people.

New' Secret Organization in British
Isles is Similar to America’s
Klux Movement.
—K-K-K
London.—A Protestant organiza
tion similar to the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan of America has sud
denly appeared in the British Isles,
accompanied by as much mystery as
the American order. Although the
organization is said to have been
formed two years ago, little had
been heard of it until December 7,
when a monster patriotic demonstra
ion was held in Westminister Abbey.
It was the first public ceremony
ever held by the order, and the
Prince of Wales, a Mason, took a
leading part in the affair. The duke
of York, another member of British
royalty, also took a prominent part
in the ceremonies.
The organization is known as “the
Most Noble Order of Crusaders” and
takes for its patron saint Britain’s
Unknown Soldier.
It is common knowledge that
among the leaders are some of the
most prominent men in England. In
cluded in the list of prominent men
are: Col. Walter Faber, Sir Charles
Wakefield and Lieut. Gen. Sir Ed
ward Bothune, director general of
the territorial forces from 1912 un
til 1917. Arthur Patterson is grand
scribe of the order.
The members wear no hoods or
sheets in the regalia, but affect a
ceremonial garb unmistakably med
ieval. A note of militarism was sup
plied by trumpets of the household
cavilry, who sounded reveille at the
conclusion of the Westminister cere
mony.
Each crusader vows “to give
service, to exercise personal self
sacrifice, to honor God, to be true to
the king, to serve his country and
to practice brotherhood, without dis
tinction of rank or class, toward all
with whom I am associated within
the order.” The society’s symbols
include a Bible, a pair of spurs,
sword, cup, chest and other objects.
It is credited with being opposed to
socialism and militant capitalism,
deploring “the dishonesty and sus
picion in our industrial life.”

so, went down to defeat in almost

Figures purporting to show that

“The country was told in 1922 that

with a deficit of $650,000,000. Yet, as
a matter of fagt, in that fiscal year
we paid off $613,000,000 of the gov

ments, and still the treasury ended
the fiscal year with a balance to its
credit of $370,000,000. The treasury
estimate of its balance sheet for 1923
was $1,200,000,000 in error. Today

COX’S REMOVAL CULMINATES A
TWO YEAR FIGHT
—K-K-K
State Forrester W. T. Cox was
fired by the state forestry board late
Friday afternoon.
The vote to oust him was 5 to 4,
and occurred in an executive session,
from which the public was excluded.
Scores who had been excluded from
the meeting, but awaited outside the
door, leaders of the fight for conserva
tion of the forests, branded the ac
tion as a victory for the lumber in
terests, declaring it virtually gave
them permission to loot the state’s
$50,000,000 timber tracts.
The ouster of Cox culminates a
two-year fight, during which Gov.
Preus has repeatedly shown his dis
like for the forester, and during
which he at several times was about
to bring about to bring about his dis
missal, only to be prevented by the
bitter opposition of conservationists.
Dismissal of State Forester W.
Cox was indicated this afternoon
when a test vote showed four for Cox
and five against him.
This vote was taken after a motion
to dismiss Mr. Cox summarily had
been made. It was on another mo
tion to lay the former motion on the
table.
The lineup of the members of the
board on the Cox dismissal is indi
cated by this vote, it is believed.
Those voting to lay the motion on
the table (in favor of Cox) were
Dean W. C. Coffey, Prof. E. G. Chey
ney, G. D. Veibert, Cloquet and W. M.
Taber, Park Rapids.
Those voting against the motion
were: Otto Diercks, state timber su
perintendent; Harry Gearhart, Du
luth, lumber interest attorney; Kaiser,
Bagley; Haven.. Little, Karson, and
W. B. Douglas, St. Paul, president of
the board.
The afternoon session started with
the presentation of a number of pe
titions asking that Mr. Cox be re
tained. Included in those are the
Minnesota State Game Protective
league, the Ramsey County Men’s
Garden club, the Minnesota State
Horticultural society, and the Wo
men’s club of Thief River Falls. In
addition there were many individuals
who presented statements.
Mr. Diercks then made the moti» n
which, as adopted, discharges Mr. Cox.
It proposes the naming of M.
Thornton, now state surveyor general
of logs and lumber, as acting state
forester, pending the appointment of
a permanent forester.
