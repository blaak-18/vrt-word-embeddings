he? lie always
terrifies me."
"Oh, I cdon't
know. It seems
rather hard to
say that. I]have
/ never heard
that he is,
S cruel."
S "o, but he
is capable of
Vt', cruelty; he is so
big, and strong,
and vital. I
tremble when I
am near him."
This description applied to me. I had
not meant to overhear it, but if ladies
will come and sit behind pots of ever
green at a dance, and.discuss their fel
low guests in clear tones, the chances
are about even that sonice friend of the
victimn, if not the unhappy creature
himself, overhears them. The worst
of it in this case was that I knew it
was true, every word of it. I was an
unlicked cub. and heavens, how my
strength oppressed me!
I longed to be a navvy on a railroad,
a pioneer in the far vwest; anything
but what I was, a subordinate in a city
office. I hated London. Sometimes
when I walked up Piccadilly in a cor
rect hat and regulation coat, I longed
to dance wildly into the roadway or
seize a middle-aged gentleman round
the place where his waist should be
and hurl him across the street. Very
mad, wasn't it? IBut I was a young
giant in muscle and height, and I had
no outlet for it. I had tried all sorts
of dissipation, of course, but that did
not do any good, either; it was hard
work and healthy living I wanted. If
I had been alone In the world I would
have been ofi somewhere long before
this, but I had a sister dependent on
me, and if I turned myself into a col
onist, what could she do?
Brutal, was 1? Gad, I could be if I
liked. I was too big all over to remain
comfortably in the varnished suit of
conventionality; I burstit out at all the
seams. A spirit of mischief camne over
me. I knew the girl who had applied
that pleasing epithet to me; she was a
Miss lRussell, an heiress, so I walked
ticetly around the screen and .asked
her to dance with me.
I do believe it was not humbug, shite
was afraid of me, in fact, too much
afraid to refuse. I did not wonder at
it when I had her in my drms; she was
such a little bit of a thing. I could
have snapped both her wrists in one
hand. I felt as if i'd got a piece of
porcelain in my charge, so that I had
to steer very carefully.
"i)o you know. Mr. Markham," she
said, as we sat otTh afterwards, "that I
am often half-frightened of you; you
look so fierce."
I longed to ask: "And brutal?" but I
was afraid of frightening her, so I only
I'M HALF FRIGHTEYNED OF TOU."
said: "WVell, I am pretty strong, and
men aren't quite like women, you
know."
"Aren't they?" she ejaculated, just
motioning with her fan toward Harold
Titmouse, who" was passing, and I
laughed, for I knew what she meant.
HIe was a girl in man's clothes if ever
there was one. "I'fi going to stay at
his place, Hereward, to-morrow," I
said.
"Oh, I'm so sorry; I didn't knuw he
was a friend of yours."
"WVell, he isn't particularly, but he's
a kind of connection, and Hereward's
a splendid country place."
As 1 bid her good night, I felt my
hand tremble when I held hers. I
should not have minded putting the
years back a bit, to those times when
the strongest man carried off the girl
he wanted and kept her. I did not
like the way she smiled at Harold, for
'knew by experience how "gold gilds
the straightened forehead of the fool."
There were a lot of us at Ilereward
the next day, and we had rare sport.
On the following morning I went up
with iarold to some pit oat-buaildlns
from which they were getting the old
iron. I had never seen dynamite used
before, and I was very much interest
ed. I wished to light the fuse, fort
ther6 was some excitement in running
away before the crash came. 'The
great wheel was up three stories high.
It was about twelve feet in diameter,
and filled the walls from side to side.
As we stood beside it we could see
right down to the ground floor, for'
there were gaps where planks were
missing. The staircases were merely
rickety ladders, and a man had to look
where he was going if he did not want
to sprain his ankle. The workmen had
been blasting for several days; they
had blown away all the gearing, and
it only remained to put a charge in the'
axle of the wheel to set it free, when it
would go crashing down, carrying with
it all the building, and Meost likely
making the old stone walls collapse in
ward with the pull. They put a lot of
dynamite in-five or six ounces. liar
old and I, and the two workmen pulled
it about and fixed it up. The fuse they
were going to use gave us four minutes
to get away. I lit it, and the first
match did not catch, though Hlarold
turned to bolt like a rabbit when he
heard it strike. I roared with laughter.
I think he had been afraid of my chaff
all through, or he would never have
been perched up where he was. The
next match caught the fuse, and went
off with a grand "siza."
Harold first, I next, and then the
two men tumbled down pell-mell. We
had reached the second story, when a
great beam, loosened by previous ex
plosions, and set off ny the sudden
shaking of our descent, fell, catching
Harold across the legs, and pinning him
to the ground like a puppy in a trap. I
believe he fainted straight away. for
he never made a sound. 1 could have
picked him up well enough if he had
been free, but I doubted if I could get
the beam off him, and overhead that
infernal thing went on "sizzing." I
yelled at the men, but before I could
turn they were past me, and down the
second staircase and out
The beam was wedged across with its
upper end against the wall, raised four
or five feet from the floor, and the lower
end on the ground. Of course, it was
near the lower end that Harold was
pinned down. Everything was covered
with the white dust of dried mortar,
which has always turned me sick ever
since. Well, now, my great strength
might be useful, and I felt a kind of
mad exultation that at last I could use
it to the uttermost of my power with
out shame.
I crept under that beam on all fours,
for I could get a better love ...re that
way. and I tried to raise it .. dh my
back. I strained myself until I thought
something would crack, and then slow

ly. slowly. it moved on its low end like
a pivot. Every second I expected the
explosion, and when I had let the end
rest again on a pile of stones, and
raised myself. I did not care what hap
pened, for I was blind and deaf with
the blood in my head, and I thought
my heart had burst.'
I picked up Harold, and staggered
down the stairway and across the
rough flooring. I had hardly cleared
the door when there was a deafening
roar and a hideous crash. Something
caught me on the back, and sent me
spinning, and I believe I lost conscious
ness.
It was only a few minutes after when
I opened my eyes, for those run-away
fellows were trying to lift me, but I
raised myself, and saw to my amaze
ment that the rubbly old walls were
still standing. This fact had probably
saved us, for the whole damage was in
side, and only a few loose stones had
flown out of the window holes. It was
one of these that had hit me. Harold,
poor little chap, had both his legs bad
ly smashed, and it seems I had made
er sick; there would not have been
much left of us if we had been under it.

A NICE, SOFT WAY.
It Brought an zxpression of Gratitude
From the Ieonefllary.
The relator of this story was on his
way up Monroe avenue the other day
when a chap who looked seedily anx
ious stopped him at Farmer street to
say:
"I think you can tell me what I am
very anxious to find out. Can there be
such a thing as a snake in the human
stomach?"
"Why, I have heard of such cases."
"Did you ever see one?"
"No. Whh do you ask?"
"'ell I met a chap down here who
was complaining that he swallowed a
snake ten years ago, and that it was
bothering him a great deal. He seemed
an honest, truthful man, but I didn't
know what to make of his story."
"Did that snake want anything in
particular just then?"
"The chap said as how he did, sir,
and that was why I was suspicious of
him."
"Did he say it was about the usual
hour for the snake to take a glass of
beer?"
"lie did, sir. That's exactly what
he said. "
"And if he didn't get it he would
keep on acting up and making things
unpleasant?"
"Yes, sir."
"Man appeared to be conscientious
and truthful, eh?"
"Indeed he did."
"He wouldn't have deceived you just
to get a glass of beer?"
"I don't think he would, sir. iHe
was holding his hands on his sides,
just this way, and his face was all
screwed up, like this, and I don't think
he would act that way unless there
was something wrong."
"But you didn't help him?"
"N-no, sir. I wanted to be sure, 'you
know."
"I think I know the man. I think
he is standing right here beside mce.
Here is a nickel to stop that riot
going on down behind his vest, and
there's plenty of saloons in this lo.
cality."
"Sir!" he said as he received the coin
and bowed and scraped. "''I am 55 years

OBEYED MILITARY ORDERS.
A Shrewd Young Sweetheart's Mlethod of
Fulfilling a Prompt )Demanld.
A young sub-lieutenant in India left
his regiment on sick leave and put up
at the best hotel, not a hundred miles
from Poona,where he was immediately
smitten by the attractions of a lovely
maiden who was staying there. lie
proposed, was accepted, and the happy
day was fixed. The colonel, however,
disapproved of sub-lieutenants getting
married, and particularly of the mar
riage of the sub in question. As he
happened to be a friend of the young
man's father he thought to prevent the
union of the fond couple by sending a
peremptory telegram, couched in
the following words: "Join at once."
The son of Mars was in despair. lie
presented himself before his intended
with the fatal missive in his hand and
anything but a look of pleasure on his
countenance; but the lady was equal to
the occasion. With a blush of maiden
ly simplicity and virgin innocence she
cast down her eyes on the ground and
remarked:
"Dear me, I'm glad your colonel ap
proves of the match; but what a hurry
he is in. I don't think I can get ready
so soon, but I'll do my best, because, of
course, love, the commands of your col
onel must be obeyed."
The young warrior looked puzzled.
"D)on't you see, my darling." he said,
'"that this confounded telegram puts a
stopper og our plaits? You don't seem
to undersland the telegram, lie says,
peremptorily, 'Join at once.' "
The lady's blushes redoubled, but
with a look of arch simplicity, she
raised her lovely eyes to her fiance and
replied:
"It is you, my darling, who doesn't.
seem to understand it. Your colonel
says plainly: 'Join at once,' by which
he means get married immediately.
What else can he possibly mean?"
"A look of intelligence replaced the
air of bewilderment on the young he
ro's classic features. lie accepted the
explanation and was enabled to answer
the colonel's telegram in forty-eight
hours afterward in these words;
"Your orders are obeyed. We were
joined at once. "--Pittsburgh Chronicle

"Yes," said the young man with plaid
trousers and a big watch chain, "I
must confess that I am deficient in

"Perhaps the modern music bores
you," said the pleasant young woman.
"It does many people, you know."
"Yes; I don't care for modern music.
There is one thing about the old songs
that 1 like very much."
"W'hat is that?"
"The fact that nobody sings them"

HELPS TO THE VOCALIST.
The Knowlng Eye, thie Glad uanhle, and the
Innocent Ilandi-Wllhat These Mean.
It has teen observed that all the
pupils of a certain singing teacher in
New York have, when singing, a
bright, happy expression of counte
nance, as though the art of vocalizing
was productive of the greatest de
light
A young woman pupil, when asked
why this was so. replied:
"Our master teaches us that for the
production of a full, bright, ringing tone
three things are necessary: 'The know
ing eye, the glad smile and the inno
cent hand.
"What in the world does he mean by
that," asked her questioner, '`and what
have they to do with your singing,
anyhow?"
"I shall tell you as well as I can. As
regards the facial expression, the pu
pils all imagine at first thatit is taught
with the idea of its visual effect upon
an audience. That is by no means the
the case, although it is, of course, al
ways more pleasant to see a singer
with an agreeable expression than one
with a distorted visage. However, an
alert, intelligent eye seems to commu
nicate its feeling somehow to the
throat; one feels surer of the pitch, and
the tone is altogether better. Try sing
ing. with such an expression, and again
with a heavy, listless eye, and see the
difference.
"Now for the 'glad smile.' It is such
a smile as extends from the lips to the
eye, and, in fact, affects the whole face.
By it the interior of the mouth, just
back of the teeth, is rounded, the pass
age from the windpipe to the lips is
made perfectly clear, and the sound
emitted becomes bright, gladsome and
ringing. Oh, that smile is a wonder
ful help, particularly for those notes
above D in the-staff."
"'I understand that pretty well.," said
the interlocutor, "but how about the
'innocent hand?' That sounds like the
nonsense."
"Not at all The hands should be
held clasped gently together; or if a
sheet of music is used it should be held
lightly between the fingers. This is
important Some singers have a habit
of knotting their hands together, or
clutching their music as though they
feared it would get away. h'ow the
muscles which knot these fingers are
away up in the arm, contiguous to the
muscles of the chest, and not far from
those of the throat The strain upon
them affects these other muscles, inter
feres with breathing, and tires the
throat.
"Now, does it sound so much like
nonsense? I tell you they are great
things, 'the knowing eye, the glad
smile, and the innocent hand;' it wasn'~ t
until I had learned their value that I
was allowed to sing in public, and to
them do I attribute much ofn my suc
cessa."-N. Y. Sun.
THE SLEEPING ROOM.
!Neat and Pretty Farnishlang for the Pri
vate Chamber.
Sleeping room floors, whatever the
depth of the purse, are best covered
either with good matting, with a small
rug for warmth, and to save wear be
fore the bed, dresser and washstand,
or with a plain colored filling as a bor.
der and a large rug in the center, or
with a rug and a painted or stained
border. The last in this case should be
first, and the matting should be second
choice. The border in all rooms where
the center is covered by a rug is usual
ly from twelve to eighteen inches wide.
There are pretty and good ingrain
rugs, in case others are too expensive.
For the small rugs a breadth of Brus
sels carpet of the right length, with
wool fringe across the ends, is often
preferred to the small Smyrna rugs.
MIoquette carpet used in the samb way
also makes a handsome rug. A
suitable remnant of either kind
can often be bought at a bargain.
If brass bedsteads are too high-priced
for bed rooms, those of iron, painted
white or a color, with simple brass
mountings, are dainty and'cleanly. A
chest of drawers in light wood looks
well with such a bedstead. I have
seen a good plain oqe from ten to
twelve dollars. Every room nowadays
has its dressing table. If not of pol
ished wood, with a plate-glass mirror,
and cunning drawers that open with
quaint brass ha'ndles, they are low
packing boxes, dressed in skirts of cre
tonne, muslin or lace. Through a ring
in the wall, or from a frame work, cur
tains are draped down each side of the
little mirror that hangs at the back.
The large, old-fashioned mahogany
stools that once graced our grand
mothers' best parlors are at a premium
to place before the dressing table. One
of the stools that has been restored for
a bed room with accessories of green
and violet is covered with a brocade
that combines those colors.
A writing-table, too, is a necessity in
a well-furnished sleeping room. They
come in light and dark wood at all
prices. WVhen too expensive, a charm
ing substitute that adorns any room is
made from one of the low pine cutting
tables used in dressmaking. The to:
of such tables is covered with billiard
cloth to harmonize with the coloring of
the room. The cloth is carried over
the edge and fastened with small orna
mental nails, or with ordinary tacks,
over which a narrow silk or dull metal
lic gimp is laid. A pretty writing-pad
is laid on top. The legs of such tables
may also be covered or painted with
enamel paints. A set of shelves., with
the addition of a pretty curtain for its
color, or a low open book-case, also add
to the comfort of the room.-'N. Y.

THE DUTY OF A VISITOR.
Etiquette of Calls, Cards and Various Invi
tations.
If you wish to retain a formal ac
quaintance you have done your duty'by
calling in person on the day set once a
year. If there is not a special day then
of course you risk finding your hostess
out, but your card represents you. Oc
casionally one finds it impossible to
make calls even in this formal fashion,
in which case you must send your card
by mail or messenger. 1Married women
leave their husband's cards with their
own; that is to say, one is left for the
gentleman of the house and one for the
hostess. A dinner party demands a
call within two weeks, but this is not
required after a tea or a large recep
tion. If a friend is ill it is proper to
call in person and leave a card with
kind inquiries written upon it. A very
Ipretty English fashion is gradually
finding its way here. After a severe ill
ness a lady may send by mail to all the
people who have called to inquire for
an engraved card reading in this way:
"Mrs. James Brown presents her conm
pliments and her thanks for recent
kind inquiries." This does away with
the necessity of making visits when
one is still in ill health, and yet it is a
recognition of the courtesies received.
It is polite, also, to leave a card of con
gratulation when a new baby appears
in the family, but one is never expected
to ask to see the mother.
Visits of condolence are made a week
after the funeral. A card is left and
no effort is made to see those in sorrow,
except by the immediate family or very
close friends. There is no excuse for
writing one's regrets or acceptances on
a visiting-card as an answer to an invi
tation. A number of women have asked
me if it is proper to send invitations to
friends who are in mourning. Of
course one could not do this until after
a month had passed, but after that
time it is quite proper, and certain
ly our friends who have had sorrow
come to them do not like to think that
they are forgotten. In writing an in
vitation or having one engraved it is no
longer considered in good taste to have
"R. S. V. P." in the corner, but, in
stead, are the English words, "The fa
vor of an answer is requested." This
is, however, never written on a dinner
invitation, for that presupposes a reply.

Grenadine Gowns.
. The black grenadine most seen
among imported gowns is of wiry silk
that makes it substantial, though it is
as thin as mousseline de sole. That
closely wrought with thick silk dots is
evidently most liked, the dots being
black or colored according to fancy,
pink or green dots. or those of fuchsia,
petunia, or other purplish reds, being
very effective. They are made over
black silk or satin, the grenadine skirt
being extremely wide, gathered to the
belt, with some pleats down the sides,
and finished around the foot with a
single row of velvet ribbon two inches
wide, or a narrow ruche of lace or of
satin ribbon. The round waist is gath
ered to a ribbon collar and belt and
fastened invisibly. Equisite sleeves
have large soft puffs of the taansparent
fabric caught here and there to display
its thinness, and are shirred around the
forearm. To brighten up the vaist,
white guipure lace ten inches wide and
pointed on the lower edge is gathered
just beneath a cravat bow and carried
down under the arms. then brought up
in the back, to be gathered again just
bstlow the collar. -Harper-'s Lazar.
A PICTURESQUE ROMANCE.,
Early HIstory of the settlement an4 City
of San Francieco.
The story of the little settlements
among the hills of the peninsula of San
Francisco reads like some picturesque
romance, and has always been very in
teresting to me because it is so differ
ent from the stories of other American
cities. Spanish priests founded a mis
I sion here, and Spanish soldiers built a
fort, or Presidio, in the autumn of 1776.
while Gen. H-owe was capturing New
York and driving Washington across
into New Jersey. Mlany of the Spanish
governors lived here.
San Francisco bay, the beautiful in
land sea, with its surroundings of fer
tile valleys and high mountains, was
sailed past by early Spanish voyagers
and by Sir Francis Drake himself, who,
in 1579, cast anchor, as all critics agree,
in "Old San Francisco harbor" (Drake's
bay), under Point Reyes. The sea fog
must have lain across Golden Gate
when the famous sea king sailed past.
For ninety years longer the great bay
was undiscovered. Then, in 1769,
Spanish priests, soldiers, and colonists
came to California; and, November 7 in
that year, the expedition led by
Gov. Portola and Father Juan
Crespi, of the Franciscan order,
discovered the bay of San Francisco.
Six years passed before the new harbor
Swas entered by water. Then, in 1776,
Mission Dolores was founded in the val
ley at the base of the twin peaks, and
a Spanish fort overlooked the Golden
Gate, and the Spanish folk began to
settle the long peninsula and the val
leys south, east and north of the bay of
San Francisco. Missions and settle
nments were founded at Santa Clara,
San Jose and Sonoma; and the Indians
were subdued, till, in 1S813, Mission
Dolores had twelve hundred converts,
and thousands more were at the other
missions.
About sixty years after Mission
Dolores was founded, an English
trader named Richardson pitched a
tent on the shore of the bay at the
head of Yerba Buena cove; Jacob Leese
built the first wooden house, and a few
Americans settled at the place. One
was old Galbraith, the blacksmith,
who used to take his home-made Ken
tucky rifle at daybreak and shoot deer
among the sand-hills where the city
hall now stands. The cove had been
called Yerba Buena because a fragrant,
white-flowered little California vinq
much liked by the Spanish people war
very abundant along the shore. The
large island in the bay, now Goat
island, was also called Yerba Buena in
those days.
So there were really three settle
ments within the present limits of the
city of San Francisco; the soldiers:
camp at the Presidio, the Indian and
Spanish village at the mission, which
was called San Francisco, and the trad
ing-post of Yerba Buena. Communi
cation was slow and diflicult among
these settlements; for bogs, rocks,
imountains and sand-hills covered with
scrub-oaks and dense undergrowth
filled the space between. In January,
1846, eleven years after its foundation,
3Yerba Buena contained only thirty
houses, but, July 8, the stars and
stripes were hoisted over the little
frontier village that lay on the eastern
slope of the peninsula, facing the con
tinent; and in January, 1847, the Amer
ican magistrate issued a decree adopt
ing the name San Francisco. In a few
months more there were one hundred
and fifty-seven houses and four hun
dred and fifty-nine people in the town.
Then followed the discovery of gold in
the Sierra foot-hills, and the "Golden
Age of '40." In three years more the
population of the young metropolis of
California increased to thirty-six thou
sand.-Charles H. Shinn, in St. Nich

THE REASON WHY.
An Explanation of the Rapid sad Prema
ture Aging of Many Women.
One reason why the average woman
wears out, grows old and plain before
her husband, is that through a mistak
en idea of duty she lays out for herself
at the beginning of her married life a
scheme or plan of duty and employ
ment for her time, every hour filled
with work, with rare and short periods
of relaxation.
This she follows religiously for years.
feeling that she has done her duty, be
cause every household event occurs
regularly and on time, while she soon
becomes merely a machine, a thing
without life of itself or volition. She
settles into her rut and goes round and
round on the same track everlastingly.
Can any woman keep brightness,
originality of thought and speech, or
even mere prettiness with such a life,
and without those things how can she
keep her husband and growing chil
dren full of the loving admiration
which is the strongest chain by which
she can bind them to her? How bright
and jolly the neighbor's wife seems
when she calls In nine cases out of
ten it is because the surroundings and
talk of your home are variety to her
and arouse her to originality and bright
ness of speech.-Donohoe's MagazLne.
