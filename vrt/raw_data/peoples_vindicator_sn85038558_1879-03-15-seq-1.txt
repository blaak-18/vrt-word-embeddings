DR. C. McLANE'S
CELEBRATED
LIVER PILLS
iFOR THE CURE OF
Hepatitis, or Liver Complaint,
DYSPEPSIA AND SICK HEADACHE.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
DAIN in the right side, under the
I edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stoi.
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; lie is easily startled, hi;
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
* skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
DR. C. McLANE's LIVER PILLS, IN
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.
REWARE OF IMITATIONS
The genuine are never sugar coated.
Every box has a red wax seal on the
lid, with the impression DR. McLANE'S5
LIVER PILLS.
The genuine McLANE's LIVER PILLS
bear the signatures of C. MCLANE and
FLEMING BRos. on the wrappers.
Insist upon having the genuine DR.

Fleming Bros., of Pittsburgh, Pa., the
market being full of imitations of the

Testimony of Valecour Merrity, Am.

REPORTED BY TUE EDITOR.
VALCOCR MERIITY (COLORED).
Am a resident of the parish of
Natchitoches. Was there on the
twenty-first of September, 1878.
Was at the first beginning of the
meeting that day, held by Blunt and
Breda. I left before the meeting
adjourned, and started up town, but I
did not go very far, because some
thing struck me that I had better not
go. I got to a store, Mr. Genoe's
store, and saw him shutting it up.
Mr. Geuoe did not say anything to I
me, but his clerk asked me where I
was going. I went to Monette's cof
fee-house, and while there saw some
armed men at a distance. Recogniz
ed Overton Breazeale in the crowd.
I went into the coffee-house then, I
and recognized no one else. I left
the coffee-house, and went back in
the direction of my home, but did a
not get there. I went near the core t
ner of the bridge near Mr. Bluut's
house, and stayed there. I could see t
the house. There was a large num
ber of people about it, all armed, I t
spoke to Mr. Cunningham and Mr. i
Overton Breazeale and another gen- n
tleman. I said : "Gentlemen, what- iI
ever you do, please don't kill the s
man," and they told me, "No; we 11
are not going to kill him; but he has
got to take back what he said;" and ii
then they told me to go off of the
street. I know John G. Lewis. I t
saw him that day. I carried a mes I
sage from him to Mr. David Pierson. s
It was a letter. Mr. Pierson was in- a
side a coffee-bouse. When he came a
out I called him aside, told him I I
had a message from a friend of mine, f4
and gave hinm the letter. After he ti
read it he said: "Valcour, I have ft
nothing to do with it whatever; but I
I will see about it." He went off, and a
after a while came back with Mr. Joe. a
Johnson, and I told them I would tl
take but one man, and they gave me 5
Mr. Johnson. We went, and I got I
Mr. Lewis and him together. Mr. a
Lewis said: "Well, Mr.. Johnson," e
and Mr. Johnson said, "Well, Lewist" n
and Mr. Lewis went on: "What are d
the chances t" and Mr. Johnson said: a
"Lewis, you will have to do as Blunt J
did, and give yourself up." Lewisa i
told him; "Well, Mr. Johnson, I b
can't take any chances." At that y.
time the shooting took place in the I
lower part of the town, and that d
broke up the conversation. A crowd ti
of men was then going by, hollering ri
for the "298." it
I know Mr. Theodore Schuman, if
that is his name. I saw him the ei
night I went to Mr. Pierson's. He n
struck me with a stick and said, ti
"Kill the d-n s-n of a b-h." I
I was and am a Republican. I was o
forced at the last election to vote R
the Democratic ticket. A crowd of I
men came to my house. (Witness n
was proceeding to relate what bad h
transpired during the visit as told ti
him by his family but was stopped.) I'
I saw the men and went off and bid I
myself, and a party of men came to I
the house where I was hid. I went I
outafter that and voted. Wheh II
got to the voting place they told sue e
that I could vote either ticket I pleas- c
ed. I asked them to read them to v
me, and they did, and they were both
alike. I voted one. Mr. Trichel
pinned a badge on me and asked me
if I was ashamed to wear it. I told
him no, and then I said, I thought he
ought to treat, as I had done a hard
day's work. He said all right, and
told me to go to Paye's store and I
would find a demuijohn. I went and
foahd the demijohn and got my drink.
CROSB-EXAMINED. I
By Mr. Beckwith-I have been in
the city two-weeks. I have not tes
tided beforethe grandjory I have
had no talk with Lewis about the case.
I saw some armed men when Mr. Ge
noe was closing up his store. I do
not know what they were doing, for I
I only saw the muzzle of their gouns.
I did not say I saw Mr. Genoe ces
ing his store. I saw his clerk shuot
ting the windoprs. I did notsee
Blunt in the street after the meeting
until he was arrested. I did not see
the Breaas after it, until I got to this
city. When I saw the infantry and
the cavalry, I said to some of the
colored men, go down and tell those
people to disband, for they are com
ing. The cavalry said among themn
selves: "Now we will miss them,
double quick," and they went right
behind the men whom I had sent and
formed a line of battle. The were
nigh two hundred of them. I did not
see them do anything. I did not see
Breda or Blunoot near the line of battle.
The men broke up after awhile and
went in-different direction. I went
over by the grave-yard. I don't
know how long I stayed there. I
don't know what time I left; when n
there I saw armed men moving about.
I left them and went to the bridge
near. Mr. Blunt's house. I went be- I
cause I saw other people going there.
I don't know what time ofda, I got
there. This was about one hundred
and ifty yards from Blunt's house. 1
I creased the bridge and met Mr. Joe
Cauningham and Mr. Overton Breas
eale and had the talk with them.
I knew I could sympathise with
them if they had any reason in them,
and I said, "Please, gentlemea, don't
kill Mr. Bloount ?" Mr. Cunninghbam
was on horseback. Blunt had not
been taken out of his house when we
had this eonversation. I do not know
where Lewis was at that time. After
talkin with Mr. Counningham I went
tow home. Ieoald's tell hew faU
I went; I did't go a hundled m iles.
It was perhaps a thousand yards. I
was not in sight of Blunt's house then.
I could see the top of it. I don't know
how long I stayed. I went back to
Blunt's house. I saw men passing in
and out of the gate. Some of them
said, "break in the door." I stayed
there a while, but I don't know how
long, and then I went toward home
again; but I didn't go to my house.
I was rather worried in my mind. I
went to my fathler's house, and went
toward Mr. Pierson's yard, and I said
to myself, "Poor Lewis, I wonder
what has become of him" I did not
hunt him up; lie came to me. I met
him in the street, right between Mr.
Pierson's two houses. I can't tell
what time of day it was. It was in
the evening, a good while before
dark. He came from the back of Mr.
Pierson's tot. I didn't see him eome
out. I saw him in there. I whistled
for him. I didn't say I did't know
where he was. I knew he was in the
woods, because a man naturally
hunts up his friends. I did say I
didn't hunt him up. I did not hunt
for him purposely, because I knew
if he was in the woods or in the
weeds hlie would come to me. The
woods were half a mile off. I knew
if he heard me he would come.
Witness was then called upon to
whistle as lie did on the occasion,
and after manifesting considerable
difidence he gave a short chirp,
which could be heard probably twen
ty yards off, but certainly not further.
I whistle that way. It may have
been a little louder, or not quite so
loud. Lewis gave me the letter that
night at my house. He asked, "what
is toobe done t" Advised him to
sympathize with Mr. David Pierson, i
because 1 knew he would be sympa
thized with my me, and would tell me
if there was anything extraordinary.
Witness then related what had
transpired between him and Mr.
Pierson. I did not ask for Mr. John- I
son to be sent with me. I did not E
ask for any one in particular to go a
with me. It was not very long after t
I had the talk with Mr. Pierson be
fore Mr. Johnson came. I told him Ii
to go to Mr. Phillips' place and wait
for me, and I would go and get Lewis.
I took Lewis on Mr. Pierson's place r
and then whistle for Mr. Johnson, a
and he came. It was while we were o
there that the firing commenced. It t,
seemed that two parties were firing. I
There was no talk between Johnson '
and Lewis concerning a band of arm- Ii
ed negroes below the Lridge. If I d
made an affidavit I don't know it. I "
did not make one. I will tell you i
about my mark. On the twelfth of
January Mr. Pierson asked me if Il
recollected the words which passed
betwixt us concerning Lewis, I said ii
yes, and went to the court house and t
I told the words, and they were taken
down and were read to me. I will 8'
tell you about my mark. I would 8
rather they would place confidence *
in my honor and not want my mark. I
After the shooting I went to the b
court house and saw Mr. Can-.
ningham, and he told me, "I can't
talk to you now," and I went home. 2
I did not go into the court-house. No t]
one threatened me. No one said be
would shoot the top of my head off. b
I did not speak to Blunt, and he did r
not speak to me. I merely bowed to t
him. I did not vote the Democratic t
ticket in 1869, nor in 1872, nor in .
1876. I never voted it but once, and I
I never said thatI bad. I never
went arounood town saying that
I ought to be employed, because
I always voted the Democratic tick
et. I never belonged to a Democratic
club. Mr. Johnson did not ask me
what the firing meant.
JOHN BAPTISTE vIENNE (COlORED,)
sworn. Live in Natchitoehes parish. I
Was born in the parisbh. Was there
September 21, 1878. Was at the
meeting on that day and remained
until it adjourned. Saw the Bredas
traveling out of town. Saw a body I
of armed men coming down. They
passed on by me, and Mr. Joe Cnn
ningham asked me where Breda and
those colored boys, and another man, 1
who was by me, said they were here
but they are gone. The men went to
Lewia' house and went in his yard,
and went to the house and in it. I re
cognized Mr. Landry Chaleville, Mr.
Ernest Masson, and Mr. Schuman with
Mr. Cunningham. A party on horse
back went up also. I did not recog
nize any of them but Dr. Gallion. I
am a Republican and have always
been. I voted the Democratic ticket
at the last election because I was in
a manner, forced to do it. They said
aill those who didn't vote it before
six o'clock in the evening would
have to leave the parish, and I didn't
want to go. Some parties came to
my bouse on election day. I heard
talking in town about what would be
done to those who did not vote, and
went home and while I was there Mr.
Jimmie King and Mr. John Hartman
and three others, whom I did not
know, came to my house and they
told my wife that if I did not vote I
wonld have to take the consequences
like the balance.
CROS8-EXAMINED.
By Mr. Luzenberg-I have lived in
Natchitochles all my life. I am fifty
seven or fifty eight years old. I know
all the gentlemeo I have mentioned.
Icannot be mistaken about Mr. Char
leville, Mr. Masson and Mr. Schoman
and I am certain I saw them. I ami
sure I saw Mr. Conningham go to
Lewis' booue. He was on foot. I
know Col. Levy. I do not remember
to have seen him. Nobody told me
exactly to vote the Democratic ticket,
but there was no other ticket to vote.
No one told me face to face that I
would have to vote, but I heard the
five geotlemen whoeame to my house
tell my wife that I would have to
vote. Mr. Charles Levy . told me
that I had better go and vote, but he
did not tell me what ticket. I came
to the city Monday week. I have
never testified in the case before. I
.me eubpana4 e as wittes, j
;. house has four rooms; two of them
I face the street. -, I was in one of them
I. when the men came. I am sure that
v Mr. Jimmie King was one of the men,
a and that Mr Hartman was another.
[ I could not see the other men, because
Sthere were some apple trees between
I me and them. I am sure they came
r on election day.
To the District Attorney.-A few
days after this some parties again I
[ came to my house. It was just af
t ter dusk, and Mr. John Trichel, and I
I ten or fifteen men, more or less, who I
rI did not know, came to my house.
t Mr. Trichel said : "Vienne, I want to
t search your house for some men who
are ordered out of the parish, and c
I who it has been reported are here or I
i were seen here." At the same time c
lie told me, "I myself do not believe )
there is any of them here, but I want
to satisfy those men." They search
ed the house but did not find any one
and went off satisfied. d

D By Mr. Beckwith-I left the Demo
1 cratic party in 1876. I never went to a
r Republican meeting before the one
]of the twenty-first. I went to the
* Republican meeting with Mr. Breazealo.
i When I saw him while at Schuman's
store he was armed with a shotgun. I
- left the meeting among the last. I sup
Spose Blunt and Breda had left before I
did. Mr. Cunningham, I think, had a
new rope in his hand. I don't know
how long it was. isuppose it was roll
ed up I was not close enough to form
an impression as to its length. I can't
say it was long enough to hang a man.
I don't know that there was a loop in it.
rI know he had a piece of rope, because
I saw it. When I first saw Mr. Cunning
ham with the rope he was right at the
corner of Mr. Phillips' old stand, and
that was where I saw him last. I was
about seventy-five or one hundred yards,
may be more or less, from him. I was
walking. From the first place I saw
him to the place I last saw him was
about fifteen or twenty steps. That is
the last time I saw him that day. There
was a posse of armed men with him.
Mr. Cunningham asked, "Where is
Blunt ?" when he was going fifteen
or twenty steps between where I last
saw him and where I first saw him. I
don't know who he was asking, but
think it was some of the men.
