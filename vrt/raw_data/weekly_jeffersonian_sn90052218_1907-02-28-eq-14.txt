LETTER FROM PANAMA.
Camp Elliott, I. C. Z., Panama, Feb.
1, 1907.
Sir:
I take exception to your article,
“Mrerely Incidental,” of January 10,
1907, in regard to the navy part. First
on behalf of myself, 1 must state that
1 have no ax to grind, and second, "to
err is human, but to forgive is divine.”
Having been aboard ship, 1 know
that neither otticer nor enlisted man is
allowed to go ashore during the drill
of coaling ship. Our friend, the late
Hickey, probably could have died from
overjoy as well as from grief had the
lieutenant commander given him lib
erty. Wait and see what the autopsy
shows.
Who would prefer charges against
the omcer had he given the man liber
ty, and the poor fellow died from over
joy?
There is no charge of brutality, as
far as 1 could see. He was put in irons
and confined, as many have been, prob
ably for insolence or refusing to obey
a superior’s order. An enlisted man,
when in charge of a working party,
can report another for insolence or
neglect of duty and the commanding
officers will punish the offender as se
verely as if an officer reported him.
No officer in our navy would dare go
as far as the German officer did, be
cause of our naval regulations.
1 can tell you the reason that enlist
ments are falling off in two words —
small pay.
Re-enlistments too, are falling off
because a man who has had a four
years’ training in the navy or marine
corps, also the army, can find employ
ment here in the zone for the govern
ment at $l5O a month, instead of sls
a month. Ask the men along the zone
if they were ever in
FRIGHTENED LIQUIDATION IN
STOCKS.
Frightened liquidation in the stock
market continued yesterday. In the
eariy trading new low levels were
contagious on American stocks in
London led to the impression that li
quidation was completed abroad, and
a snarp raily caaie. Just before this
rally rhe seven let it be known to
their friends that tne market was
around oottom, and there was a quick
buying movement tnat Battened out
before tne close. The Seven nad been
leading tneir friends into the slaugh
ter pen recently, and tneir utterances
are not taken with such complete faith
as formerly. Tne heavy semng of Ca
nadian racific, St. raul, nne, North
ern raciuc, Great Northern, iteadmg,
Union raciuc and Steel tn«.t toliuwcd
the laiiy destroyed what nttie confi
dence was left. The cio&e was near
the low ugures of tne day in many
issues, while tne sentiment was guo
my. it is becoming apparent tnai tne
insiders aie borrowing stocks freeiy
to give a false impression of a large
short interest. Wnen tne brokers and
traueis speak of tne present move
ment as a Teddy bear movement they
are not trying to be funny, ihe in
formation that the president intends
to make even i he Seven oocy the laws
has been driven home to eve,y man
in wall St.eet. The universal opinion
is tnat a year of liquidation must re
sult unless Ihe Seven publicly agree
to ooey the laws and tne presmeut
puonciy announces a truce in nis war
of extermination. One su anye feat
ure or tne situation is that Vvali Street
does not blame KoosvVelt,
for it is beginning to iealize tnat it is
the man wno commits the crime, and
not tne policeman, who is responsible
for an anest. Wall Street is in re-

THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
$87,000,000 to $210,000,000. The
army appropriations have jumped to
a large amount and the expenses of
the navy have doubled.
“It is too much to expect that the
nation can continue to shoulder these
enormous expenses. God has provid
ed us with a prosperity such as no
other nation has ever enjoyed. A
slump will come sooner or later, and
w e must prepare for it. This is one
of the reasons why I am advocating
getting rid of the Philippines.’ 1
MUM
HOSPITALITY OF GOV. VARDA
MAN.
Hon. Tom Watson, Populist, has
during his visit to Mississippi been
sharing the hospitality of Gov. Var
daman, Democrat. It looks as though
an era of good feeling had returned
and speaks well for the removal of
partisan prejudice. A few years ago
a northern Republican governor might
have been entertained at a Democratic
governor’s home in the south but a
Populist—never. Mr. Watson does
not deny being a Populist nor does
he deny that he helped to make Hon.
Hoke Smith, a former member of Pres
ident Cleveland’s cabinet, governor of
Georgia. He advises the farmers to
keep their union out of politics but
to get in knee-deep themselves. Con
cerning Mr. Watson’s suggestions the
Picayune correspondent says:
Mr. Watson asserted that he is anx
ious to have it thoroughly understood
that his present tour is not with a
view to advancing the political pre
ferment of himself or any other man
or men. His ambition is to bring
the farmers of the south and west to
a full realization of their position in
the material and economic world, and
influence for bringing about

A LITTLE CHiLD LAUGHED.
(From the Baltimore Sun.)
A little child laughed—and the sun
came out,
A little child laughed—glory echoed
his shout,
The birds caught the wonder and car
ried it far
In the song that they sang to the
clouds and the star.
A little child laughed—and the shad
ows and mist
By the beams of love’s beautiful sun
shine were kissed.
A little child laugned—and our burden
and care
Fell away as our sorrows fall away
after prayer.

The record of Boston’s shoe ship
ments for 1906 is now complete, a.id
while the last six months did not see
so great shipments as the earlier
months of the year, the quantity ship
ped exceeded the record of any prev
ious year. The total shipments for
1906 were 5,179,543 cases, as compared
with 5,100,038 cases for 1905, 4,730,332
for 19u4 and 5,094,436 lor 1903. if
these cases contained twenty-two pairs
of shoes each, which is a conserva
tive estimate, the number of pai r s
of shoes shipped from Boston aloae
to all parts of the country and abroad
would amount to 113,949,946, or more
than enough to give every Inhabitant
of the United States a pair and some
a second pair.
