IS liERE IN SHREVEPORT
An Organization of C.lored
People to Protect Criminals?
Tie failure to cature Pr uce Edwards,
tio :r) rllur ý'i.li , has eu 'ieted to the
s*.rat upnal ': that there it perhaps in the
city of >nrevoport an organization of
co orei pe.ile wLo-e aim anti purpose is
to aii and I rot.ct criluinsal of their race.
ic thele slob an organization?
It tray Le . Did for the ne.roes as a elses
that ihy are Lct inclined to what may be
termeid lahaisri.
It ,r:y bie said to the credit of lie col.r It
sople that as a cl.sa they are well
behaved in .hreveport. It is t:ue that
now aid then a hLfero of the present
enerlrtrlon mIy assurde .somlt Importance,
but he can he readily taken trom his perch
or clil-pe of his blUrness whenever he
attempt~ to be too, utterly too too.
It is also irue that there l3 a class of
negroes who idle and gamble, and these
wc,ud not hesltate to give aidt and ol.nftrt
to a fugitlve of their race; aid it is true
tait tlere ale many Ltgroes in this city
wuo would froni race sympathr, g'Ve
noomlort to one of their color who had
.nmmitted a crime, but, from our general
obiservatioi, of the negr, as a class, we
may say there is no organiza ion In
.urSveport of negrees whose aim and
purpose Lo to give aid and comfort to
failtive criminals.
There is do incentive for the well
benaved, well to do negroes in Shreveport
to engage in such conspiracy, which, when
discovered would lead them to the peni
tentiary for long terms of years, and the
shiltess negroes, the negroes who Idle and
gamble, wou d not ventu.e into such an
organiz.tion. I'nere are negroes who may
oe well informed of the movements of
criminals, lugitivee, murderers of white
men who never w:l venture the least clu
which wculd lead to capture of the mre
wanted, atd these could not be induced to
tell even for money, but these same
ogroes would not band together to give
aid and comfort to lugitives-they have
bettar sense. The statement or suggestion
tnat there is such an organizstlon In
ibreveport, is in our opinion, moonshine,
and this much has been written to dispel
tne impression created In the minds of
some people who accept, without reason
.ng, all the exaggerations and the sensa
.ious in some newspapers as being facts
it any newse aper man has kowledge of
,uch an organization he Is direlect in his
luty in not Informine the police and assls,
uog in the ar. eat of the eonsplrators.
Because 'Prince Edwards has not been
raptured is no indication of such an
inlawful organlztioa being in easstenc:,
for that 1Cdwards came' to Shreveport,
where he may be in hiding, as alleged,
vh!cn is nonsense.
We tasy venture the assertion that
Sdwamu .' friends in Soreveport arc few, It
. iy, han ne would not take the risk of
-:ptcr" by coming to the city. He
,su ned, no d ub's that his saflty was

TOWING COAL TO CUBA.
Practical Te*t of the ItsIg' Trade to lie
Slade Thhl \e'.-k.
Philadelphia, Juno 19.-T'he first at
tempt to tow coal-laden barges from Phil.
adelphia to the island of Cuba will be
made early this wek. when the new
tug Cuba will leave here tfr Havauna
with the barges Mlatanzas and Cardenas
each carrying 3140) tons
In this new nndlertakinu whi-h, if
successfully ctrried out, will revolution
tionize the West India trade, unusual
interest is aroused through ut shipping
cireles and practical men are dividedl in
their opinions as to whether or not the
attempt will prove profitable The tow.
ing of barges to Cuba, or any other
southern port, can nt be carried on
throughout the winter months or the
ubrricane season, during August. Sep
tember and October.
The coml any that will suffer most
should this undertaking prove suceoss
lul will be the Earn Line Steamship
,ompany, which operates steamers be
:ween Philadelphia andt the West Iu
lies, carrying out coal and returning
with cargoes of iron ore.
The Staples Coal company, owners of
:hees barges, is a corporation closely al
led with the Pennsylvania Railroad
omlnpany, and it is presumed that the
Reading Railway will engage in a sim
lar undertaking, if this attempt proves
muccessful.
SERMON AGAINST DIVORCE
Father and Mother Arraigned as Thoy
Sat Beside CI.t d's Coffin.
Kokomo, Ind., Junie 19.-There was a
sensation at a funeral here. The little
child of William and Nora Hancock
was being buried The parents are
divorced and the child was kept by its
grandfa! her The minister, Rev. G. E
Walk, took for his text, "When fathet
and mother forsake me my Lord will
take me up." The sermon was a caustic
arraignment of la'terday divorce. The
divorced father and mother sat togeth.t
at the head of the casket, enduriag in
silence the minister's arraignment. A
brother of Mrs. Hancock could not stand
what he declared was an insult to his
sister, and he dramatically demanded a
retraction of the sermon.
At the open grave Jackson pliced his
hand on the preacher's shoulder and
threatened violence if an apology and
retraction were not immediately forth
coming. The minister refused to re
nounce his words, and had not friends
interposed a personal encounter would
have followed. Rev. Walk said after.
ward: "Yes, I preached against divorcE
and I meant all I said. I am sick and
tired of funerals with indiscriminate
laudation. I think the truth should be
told at funerals as well a4 elsewhere. I
have nothing to take back."
