Th State Debt.
iN. O. Item ]
We veral weeks ago pointed out
the contingency which has just arisen
1a our State finances. From what
was them in sight it was apparent
that the January interest of the State
fusded debt could not be paid unless
the Fiscal Agent or some other bank
would advance a quarter of a mil%
lion of dollars or so and await the un
aertain chances of the future for re.
imbursement. A proposition was I
wadee the State National Bank, now
Fiscal Agent, to leap into the finan
cial breech, and it has unhesitating
ly declined, "from an imperative
ene of duty to the interest of its
'teetholders;" though it generonsly
aoneontea to permit any other'bank to a
etmume the duties and responsibili- o'
ties of the Fiscal Agency and ad
Sance the needed sum. Under these
circmatances, a committee of the "'
b'unding Board will to-day make a
' ireuit among the banks to see what
".pa be done in the premises, though "
.4th but small likelihood of success. ,
Is the first place, in view of the
tnraiened circnmstances of our pen.
ile and their inability to properly s
',rovdo for their own current wants, u
Svwald it be wise for them to go into ,
'bhe compound interest business, by
,greeing to pay interest on new
!tsas in order to pay old interest a
',,warpe which they are unable to "
asaet t The truth is that the present i
embarrasments of the State arise n
from the reckless manner in which '
wMthlhss warrants and tainted obli a
giAt.n have been funded, i process
by which the State debt has been i,
swelled to fully double its just pro
perttons, and if a halt has to be called
IthS better to do it now than at any
future time. The State, like the
city, is unable to pay fancy obliga- i
trees, contraeted in violation of eve- I
ry rule of right and constitutional
prehibition. It is not repudiation to
refuse to pay any except honest debts,
ta is It fraudulent in refuse payment
when you have nothing wherewith to
pi. There Ji a limit to the taxlay
ing power of our people, and not
eves the most strained sense of honor
ean demand 'tihe payment of large
eeditora in preference to small ones,
sueh for instance as the teachers of
our children and the protectors of
oat lives and homes. The situation
is a perplexing one but an attemnpt to
bartd on itnfest to pay interest
woud only add to its perplexity.

WEEKLY WORLD,

will be scut (pusfage perpaid)
From Now Until January 1, 1S79
FOR
TEN CENTS. of
1PThis tpeial Offer Is made to enable the
Southern people to see for themselves how good
a paper TIE WORLD is and how worthy it is
of their sudport. a
On the lst of Mary, le6, the ownership and
controlo of THE WORLD passed into the hands
of the undersigned, unller whose albsolute and Me
untrammelled directions TIlE WORLD has
ever since remained and now remains tai
iDuring the whole of this time THE WORLD
has labored patiently and Ierseveringly for the D)
accomplishmlent of two objects in politics of
paramount interest to the Southern people.
I. The restoration of Local SelftGovernment
at the *South.
II. A Real Reform of the Civil Service, in
such wise as to destroy the political machines
under the opperation of which it has comeu to
pas that the people are taxesa to support politi.
cal parties, whereas political parties have Ino
other reason of belng except to lessen the bur.
den on the government.
The first of thcee objects have been triumph
antly accompllshed. A'l inteligent Northen
men now admit that all parts of the country
were as deeply interested as the South in seeing
it won. A corrupt and anti'Democratic govern
meut in the Soutlh was a permanent peril to the
ascendancy of true American principles in the
Federal Government and therefore to the peace
and honor of the whole people.
The secondl political object for which THE Wm
WORLD oontendls still remains to be fully ach
loved. The actual Adtlinistratioan began its
career with excellent promises in this direc
tion of which It is sufficient to say that they to
have heen as yet only in part redeemed. TIIi'
tWO)RLD for ils part will resolutely support any
honest efforts to redeem these pronmises fuly, be
by whosoever made, anl will as resolutely de
Iloene' every olbstical thrown in the way of re
deelminag them, from whatever quarter Co
It seemis to the undersigned eminently proper
that he shoulld ask the ae-operation ofil the best I
men of the Soautlh with THE WORLD in its ef
forts to carry nt the policy here outlined. Ih,
believes TiHE WORLD tobe a paper which
Southerll citixens and Iaemocrats :canl recom
mlellc to Sonthern readern as an ilndllaee worthy
and important to be brought to bear with col.
ntently increasing power upon our national af
airs, in the interest of truth, of justire and of
rmnolly anmonlcg our peopla of all sectionlls.
It is my desire to keep THEl WORLD in a
lively relation witt the Iest thoughts of the
SMoth, to the endl that the best ideas. wishes
and feelings of the Soutlhern pe'oplo may be
cle'arly and fairly known to the . airthl the East
aeit, the West. Alike ill private and Iih publie
a llais the nmisalnderstandinig of men by one all- en
other lies at. the' root of so nrnch evil that the eel
word itself has come to be a synonym with
quaarreling and strife. It was a wise saving of
lerdl Elgin, at the time of oa, of oour sharpest
disputes with Great Britain, that two intelli- fol
gent gentlemen alone on a raft in the Atlantic
with plenary power could maljst the whole mat
ter honoralhy in an hour.
THE WCOLD simply asks its fielnds at the
South to aidit in bringing alaont a eomplete
'meeting of minds on all public qaestiones Ie
tween the intelligent citizen of ll part of the
Union, WILLIAM HIENRY IiRLIERT.
