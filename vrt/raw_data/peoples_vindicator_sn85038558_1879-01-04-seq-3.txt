It is usual to pay a published trilbute
to the memory of deceased friends. But
while nature drops the tear of sorrow
o'er the remembrance of departed ones,
the nblject of this brief obitnury has
left a bright testimony to sorrowing and
sympathising frienls, that their loss is
her eternal gain. The bereaved family
and relatives can and should realize the
consolation of religion, that she in early
life consecrated herself to her Savior, and
to her death remained a consistent and
exemplary member of the Bapl ist Church,
with which'she united in 184S. Born in
Amitie City, Miss., 21st May, 1822, she
died in her 57th year.
We can offer no other consolations to
the family and relatives, than to com
mend them to those promises of Eternal
Life, found in the sacred pages on which
she relied with a tinue christian's un
wavefing faith. May this faith sustain
them all; n this sad hour of sorrow, and
prepare them like her to meet life's close
in peace.

What Paid lepelrn Tell Is.
Packari's Pardea and Retar.
(N. O. Times.)
A rumor has been quietly going the
rounds, among persons who are post
ed, to the effect that, in case any ex
tensive customhouse changes are
made. Packard will be offered the
first place and put in command of the
party to organize it for 18 0. The
thing seemed almost incredible, but
on inqmury your correspondent learn,.
ed that such a plan had been recently
talked of in very high offecial circles.
Beyond this, nothing positive could
be learned.
It is probable that additional coun
sel will be employed by the govern
ment to assist the United States dies
trict attorney of Louisiana in the
prosecution of the persons accused of
intimidation at the late election.
Major C.L. Walker, of the New
I Orleans hbr, is among those named to
be retained, if the attorney general
can get the money for the purpose of
pressing more vigorously the prose
eutions for alleged election frauds in
South Carolina and Louisiana. Just
now the department does not see
where it will come from. Doubtless
it will be found.
BLAINE AND LAMAR.
A Diseassmle Over a Questlm of ('e.
sttutlemal Law.
Mr. Blaine--We are going down to
I Indict no sian and to try no man. It
is to ascertain aquestionu for beyond
and farabove the rights or the wrongs
of any Individual, and that I wheth
er their is a fair and impartial reproe
saentalob in the make.up of the Cn
gress of the United States; and in this
connection I beg here to reply to a
remark made by the honorable Seas
tor from Missiaippi (Mr. Lamar] on
the day when thee reolatiosa were
debated before, and that remark lan
plied that even if their might be
some advantade for the South la the
pplar branehb of Csongre It was an
advanstage moe than cempemaald by
seon oentervail aNlttvatsge which
we bold is this tiaaen. Sir, when.
,I eg that pham b beaught to light,
heiSnlea that its held p a a dread.
sseeoa M at Mlm snpptl e mthe
tints rcr that u msmlIemthera
.s'atefs that send twelve Senators to t
titi' tin:r with one-hnlf the white
iwPoulatint of the six New En..gltild r
St:ates and with less than the aggre- .
gate poipulation. .Sothat if the reume
dty hinted at by the Senator fromi
Mississippi hould ht. resorted to, tha:t
swapel would cut mnote deeply inro tle
L.o:th than, it would into the Nortb. t
Let me tell biom, sir. that of thirty- i
two Senators who sit lere from the 1
Sonthernt States aitnd lrty tnour tfrotm
the l Nurthern rtates, a unt h lIa rgr
n mbier of con-tituents ite behiidt
each Northern senator than behind
each Southern Senator. lThen if you
take it in classes between the North t
and South the advanttage is over- r
wheltningly against the South. If you t
take the frightful example of New
England, always held up, I will, ath
e-r together six States of the South
that illustrate in a far more striking
manner what the Senator intimated
by the Injustice of representation in
this branch. .l
Mr. Lamar-Mr. President, the
Senator from Maine misunderstood t
the position which I took with refer- 1
ence to the representation of States 1
in this Senate, owing entirely no
adlbt to the want of clearness in my
own statement. If I did not misap
prehend the Senator from Maine on
that occasion his argument was that
under the amendments which con
fetr1ed freedom and citizenship and
suffrage upon the black race, the
South through certain irregular meth
ods had obtained a representation in
the House of Representatives dispro
portioned, not to her population but
to the actual voters at the polls; and
if I did not mistake him he quoted
from the Supreme Court reports of
the United States a decision that the
power of Congress did not extend far
enough to remedy that disproportion
ot representation in the other House.
If I understood him he said that de*
cision which denied the power of Con
gress to legislate Po long as the laws
of a State itself did not deny ro
abridge any of these tights to the ne
gro population-that Congress was
powerless to intervene- was indorsed
by him as being true to the letter of
the Constitution which kitleth. I
understood him to say that the Con
stitution as thus construed was a
killing Constitution, and that the let
ter of it stood up as a barrier to the
enforcement of the rigths conferred
upon the colored citizens.
Mr. Blaine-The Senator misunder
stood me.
Mr. Lamar-Owing to my own ob
tuseness no doubt.
Mr. Blaine-Such might be the
ruling of the courts, I said, and the
letter which killeth, but I protested
against the equity and justice of it.
I did not at all admit that that was
what in my judgement the Constitu
tion was designed to be.
Mr. Lamar-Precisely. lHe did not
admit that it was what it was design
ed to be; but do I understand now the
Senator to say that he differs with
the Court in its construction of the
Constitution i
Mr. Blaine-I do. That maay not
be a very great shock to the Court;
but nevertheless I do.
Mr. Lamar-I differ from the Sena,
tor. The Court will be greatly
shocked, but perhaps will survive the
attack. (Laughter.) Then sir, I
thought it was not amiss to suggest
that if there were remedies in the
American people to prevent this dis
proportionate representation, and,
if we eonld so legislate as to make
not population but actual voters at
the polls to be the limit of the repre
sentation of a State; and if Congress
or the people by their amending pow
er should thitus interpose to reform
thle Government and to make it a
Government based entirely upon
numbers, not that New England alone,
but that the South also might appre
hend that you would go further and
crumble into' ruin our eatire system.
Sir, when the gentleman tells me that
the South is in the same danger that
the East is, that the New England
States are, he only reiterates a fact
that I have attempted to impress up
on both sections, and that is that the
inviolability of the Coastitution is the
only shield and safeguard of New
England as well as of the lSoith.
Sir, the menace does not come from
the weak and impotent South. When
this popular movement, this effort to
bring this Government to the pare
principle of democratic absolutism,
trampling down in its relentless
strides the barriers of the Coastitu
tion, he will And the power not in tile
Sooth, but in the mighty West, whose
little linger is greater and more po
tent than the two thighs of South and
'East united.
SOUTIWORTHI SOUTHWARD.

Brfluess of 1876.
Potter to Petter with This.
For some days it has been rn
morted that ex-United States Com
missioner 8onthwortb, of New Or
leans, who is now here, had a good
deal of valuable information about
the canvass of 1876.
This morning's.' Post prints,
prominently displayed, a column
Interview with Southwortb, which
I has made the most decided sensa
tion ofthe season.
He says that in 1876 the Repub
licans bulldosed the Democrats
out of 12,000 votes in New Orleans
with sewing machine warrants,
and that the Democratic majority
lin the city ought to have been
18,000 instead of 8000, that per
sons against whom be issued war
rants were innocent, and it was
only done to keep them from vo
I ting; that the scheme was fully
understood b! all the Republican
oficials, and It was done because
Sthey thought the end justified the
means, and they wanted to: keep
Louisiana in their hands.,
Judge Sonthworth makes the
flllowing sttateunt:
As United States commissiouer
I teased the warrants, and know
exactly how many were issued,
and hoy many were executed.
PitklHn, as marshal, was entitled
I only to fees for the warrants exe
eated, bat he chargea br every

treasury forty-serve hundred anil
old dollars; when he was legally
e';ititl d to about. sev'el hundred
dlollars.
Pitkin, it is reported, denies this
statemtent entirely.
Southvworth will be ,calledi laiotre
the Potter coulmnittee, and will. it
is understood, supply the missing
link in the history of the canlvass
lIy some sort of chicanery on
the part ot certain Radical leaders,
the test oath for jurors was swug
gled into the codlified sattutes, al
though the law prescribing that
oath had been repealed by a Re
publican Congress in 1871. TLe
law should have been entitled an
"act to secure ignorant jurors, tor
its effect was to exclude from the
.jury-lbx all who had given any
-.aid or comiort to the enemy" dui.
ring the war; and it is well known
that in many localities all tile best
Imeln were "rebels." A year ago
tihe House repealed the section of
the statutes containing this test
oath, ind the bill went to the Sen
ate, where it was referred to the
Committee on Revision'aSothe Laws.
There it has slept ever since. It
is high time for the coumittee to
report it back to the Senate. It
cannot be for the interest of any
party or section to have the great
mass of intelligent Sosthern citi
zens excluded from the juries of
the United States courts. The
long delay of the Senate commit
tee, in view of all the facts, is not
credible to its sense of justice and
fair play.-[Washington Post.

though the heavens fall.

c.lass, sent or party. There need ,emas nlistery
about its loves and ihates. It is fok the honest
