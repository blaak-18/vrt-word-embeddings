BEARING FRUIT.
The gallant fight make against l
the trusts by Hon. W. J. Bryan dur
ing the last presidential campaign
is bearing fruit. The great Demo
cratic leader opened the war on the
trusts only a few months ago, but
already the monopoly-ridden peo
ple of the country are heeding his a
wise counsel. Not since the war
had the American people heard
such stirring and earnest appeals to 1
their patriotism. Occasionally a
mild condemnation found its way
out of the White House, but that
ring of sincerity and determination s
which characterized the utterances a
of the eloquent Nebraskan was (
painfully absent from anything that s
has emanated from the nation's it
cheif executives. With an unvary- fi
ing monotony the stereotyped anti- I
trust plank had made its appear
ance in the political platform at
every national convention. But
there it ended. It received the tri- a
oute of a sigh from the nominee
and provoked a contemptuous smile B
from the bloated monopolist. Then e:
the hated thing remained in "inno- 9g
cuous desuetude" four more years.
But at Chicago this shameful
mockery was brought to an end.
The Democracy found a champion. f
An honest, able leader. No parody
suited him. No burlesque would B
be permitted by him. Instead of a G
meaningless plank to catch votes, ai
a sincere, bold and unmistakable de- T
claration against trusts was adopted. P1
And from that day Mr. Bryan em
waged a relentless war on iniqui
tous corporations. He opened the
eyes of the people to the impending
danger and alreading several States W
have taken steps to check the trusts in
or monopolies. to

The Alabama Legislature has as
passed an anti-trust law similar to ye
the one is existence in Geoigia. It of
renders void all contracts made b
with a view to lessen free conpeti-a
tion in the sale, importation, or ha
manufacture of articles of domes- is
tic growth or of raw material. A me
corporation violating this law will os
be deprived of its charter, and an fai
individual violating it will be sub- sai
ject to fine and imprisonment. The crc
legislatule has also passed a bill tWo
prohibiting insurance companies an
doing business in Alabama from be- of
longing to any tariff association sig
which seeks to establish a uniform say
rate and prevents free competition bui
on insurance rates. A company of
violating the act is forced to pay, the
not only its full losses, but 25 per pea
cent additional to the insured. has

The penalty is a fine of not less j

About Farming.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
a8 DusoN, LA., March so, 1897.
es We ale well advanced in our farm
ts ing operations but we are having
too much rain. There will be a big
crop of cotton and corn planted
is and only a small crop of rice this
to year on account of the high price
t of seed. It is a fact cotton is low,
le but we can afford to raise it anyway
as we have learned to raise our own
- bread and meat and then what we
)r have to buy is also cheap. There
s- is a demand for more improved
A methods of cultivating and planting
I our crops. The system of rotation
is not properly understood. Some
farmers plant cotton on the
same land fifteen years; no one
e crop should be planted more than
I two or three years on the same land;
corn and peas should follow cotton
and cane or any other crop. Some
of our lands are beginnig to show
n signs of long cultivation. Some
a say peas sell too high. That is true
but we can raise them as well as
anywhere else and with bisulphide
V of carbon can help them fall from
the pea weavil. There is a small
r pea planted in Acadia parish that
has only to be planted once in a life
time. It is very prolific and makes
a large amount of vine which im
prove the land. It is equal to the
1 clay pea. Some object to it as it ts
r impossible to get rid of it when
once planted. But the tie vine is
just the same and does not improve G4
the land. This pea does and is not
quite as bad on cotton as tie vines.
a Tree planting is much neglected on
on our wide prairies where wood is
so scarce. Every farmer should
now plant a lot of China seed to
make trees to transplant on other
year, and in six years be At
iniependent of our bad roads. T[
China seed can be planted as late as we
May z, if soaked and the pulp
rubbed off will come up in ten days. a
Pecans will co:ne up planted as late fl
as the last of May. Walnuts must
be planted green with the hull on
when gathered to ensure growth the
next year.
The winter has been hard on
stock and they are quate poor. We do
not save enough ha r. This is the best H
grass growing land in the State. We
have several kinds of grasses that
make excellent hay when properly
cured. We never have too much
of it. I dont care how many stock
we put up in the fall but spring al
ways finds us short.
I do not want to make my letter
too long but let me say we do not .
ditch and drain our lands properly.
As we have learnt to dig ditches
with animals in pklce of man-power
we must do some more on that line.
Four mules, two men, one plow,
one triangle-shaped tool can make a
large ditch one half mile long in
one day. I will say more on this
subject in my next letter.
