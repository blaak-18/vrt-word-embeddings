THREE GENERATIONS.
Deepstep, Ga., December 19, 1907.
Dear Mr. Watson: Enclosed you will find
money order for $2. You will please send me
your Weekly Jeffersonian and magazine. I
have never missed a copy of your magazine;
have saved every one. As you loved and sym
pathized with Napoleon, so I have loved and
sympathized with you. My father has always
been a staunch friend of yours, so he trained
his willing son. I have a little boy twelve
months old, who already likes to look at the
pictures in your magazine. I, too, hope to
train him in the way he should go politically
(to follow Watson). I remember, when quite
a lad, my father sent me to the depot to bring
out a, preacher (who is now a presiding elder)
to camp meeting. After arguing politics with
him in my boyish way, he slapped me on
the back and laughingly said: “Well, little
man, I admire your pluck, if we don’t agree
on politics.”
As I believed in you then, so I believe in
you now. My confidence in you has never
faltered nor wavered, and I often wonder how
one head and heart can contain it all—all
that’s good, all that’s wise, all that’s bril
liant, and all that’s just and right.
I have a young friend seventeen years old
now in school, but a follower of Watson, and
stands there pat wherever you find him. My
young friend, Lloyd Hall, has high ideals, and
bids fair to reach a high mark, and you may
always count on him as your friend and cham
pion.
I, too, am one of the R. F. D. boys, and was
perplexed when I did not see your name
among the invited guests at the National Con
vention. I hope soon to see it proven clearly
why.
[ would take great pleasure in soliciting
subscribers for ypur paper and magazine, but,
as you know, Uncle Sam does not allow us to
take any subscriptions.
Wishing you a merry Christmas and a hap
py New Year, I will close.
Faithfully yours,
ALONZO G. VEAL.
