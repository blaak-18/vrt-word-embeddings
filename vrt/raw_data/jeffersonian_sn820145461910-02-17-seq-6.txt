O LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE II O
A LETTER—AND A REPLY.
Dear Sir: —While I dislike to trou
ble you, or take your precious time,
1 felt that this, perhaps, justified it.
I take the position that you are
not opposed to Foreign Missions —
have not gotten that opinion from
your writings. I asked the party fa
voring me with the article who Mr.
Editor was, but, as yet, have not
learned. What surprised me was
that a devoted Christian would con
descend to the use of such language,
when, if one wishes to call attention,
the ‘couching or tatting in courteous,
polite language is far more forcible.
I even notice where he calls atten
tion, “The world says money talks.
That hits the keynote, does it not?”
Christ authorized the memoralizing
of the “widow’s mite”, —seems to
be some difference, but I guess you
can answer that in about one-fourth
the space. I have in mind only the
vindication of the truth.
Yours truly,
J. B. DINES.
Fredericktown, Mo.
Mr. J. B. Dines, Fredericktown, Mo.
My Dear Friend: —I appreciate
your letter. It is difficult to un
derstand why ministers of the gos
pel, calling themselves Christians,
and preaching the doctrine of broth
erly love, should assail me with such
abuse and such rancorous hatred. I
have done nothing in the world, ex
cepting to criticise the modern de
parture from the Pauline method of
doing mission work. For 1800 years
after the crucifixion of Christ, For
eign Missions were conducted on the
plan which I advocate. The mission
aries delivered the message, preached
the gospel, unfolded our Savior’s
plan of -salvation. They did noth
ing else. They did not furnish hos
pitals for the sick; they did not send
physicians and surgeons around to
do gratuitous service to the afflicted;
.they did not furnish homes for desti
tute widows in Africa, and destitute
widows in India, China and Japan;
they did not establish kindergartens,
common schools and finishing col
leges for the secular education of
black children, brown children and
yellow chidren throughout the
Orient; they did not furnish food
and clothing in time of famine. They
simply preached the word of God,
and went their way, leaving the con
verts at one place to become the
nucleus, who would win over other
converts and thus establish a
Church.
About one hundred years ago, an
enthusiast named Carey, an Eng
man, began this modern system of
virtually hiring the heathen to re
nounce the faith of their fathers, and
to call themselves Christians. At the
present time, they offer to the poor
er classes of heathendom such in
ducements to call themselves disci
ples of Christ that we never can tell
whether they have really undergone
a change of heart, or whether they
have simply come over to us to get
their share of the loaves and fishes.
Now, my position is that so far
as charity work is concerned, the
rich Chinese, of whom there are mil
lions, should take care of the desti
tute Chinese; the rich Japanese, of
whom there are millions, should
take care of the destitute people of
Japan; the wealthy Hindoos, of
whom there are millions, should
take care of the needy Indians. It
is not our business to do if. We
should not assume that responsi
bility: we ought first to take care
of the destitute millions of our own
national household: t we ought first
to seedy- clothe and educate the
young and the old, the males and
the females of our own great white
race in these United States before
we go abroad to feed, clothe, shelter
and educate the poorer classes of
heathendom. As long as we
a cripple in America, a destitute
Confederate soldier, a homeless
widow, a poverty cursed man, wo
man or child, in city or country, we
ought to let our charity relieve their
wants before we turn our backs upon
our own flesh and blood and carry
our relief to the black, brown and
yellow peoples of the East.
There are more than a hundred
and fifty missionary organizations in
this country: I regard them as so
many ulcers depleting the strength
of our Republic. They are draining
off into foreign fields our very life
blood. There are not only thousands
of foreign missionaries who are fat
tening upon high salaries, luxurious
living, easy jobs, elegant homes for
the winter, and beautiful mountain
resorts for the summer, but there
are dozens of Home Secretaries and
Mission Board members who are
having a 'glorious time in elegant
offices as the result of this modern,
unscriptural method of complying
with the command of Christ that we
shall go into all the world and
preach His Gospel.
—So far has this madness carried
people that we are actually buying
negro children in Africa wherever
the parents, who were so-called con
verts, have died and left their off
spring to come into the control of
their nearest relatives. Under Afri
can custom, the orphan child passes
to the nearest male relative: our
crazy foreign missionaries are buy
ing up these children throughout
Africa, and are tenderly caring for
them during infancy, girlhood, boy
hood and youth until the girls can
marry from the mission station, or
the young black men can get a good
job somewhere under the Foreign
Mission system. The congregations
of the South, of the North, of the
East and the West of our own coun
try are being worked up to that en
thusiasm which furnishes money, in
disregard of local needs, to be sent
abroad into Africa to buy up little
niggers to become inmates of or
phanages, kindergartens, boarding
schools and colleges. Where this
mania will end, God only knows; but,
with the rich Yankees like Ogden,
Carnegie, Wanamaker and Rocke
feller dumping their millions on the
negro schools of the South, while
the Southern people are being com
pelled by clerical coercion and fa
naticism to dump their millions on
Africa, the outlook for our future is
dark.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.
HERE’S A LIVE ONE!
My Dear Jeffs:—l thought I would
write a few lines to tell you that, at
the First Baptist church in this city,
on the first Sunday in this month,
in our Sunday-school, we, by a vote
of about two to one, decided not to
Jeffersonian
send any more money to China for
this year, at least.
Mr. Watson, I wrote Mr. Duck, of
Union City, and told him to answer
your questions; that I had one
brother and two brothers-in-law that
were Union men, and, for their sake,
to come out and fight you in the
open. I have also written to the -
Christian Index and asked them to
let you reply to them through their
paper. I have been asking Dr. W.
B. Crumpton some questions; he
gave me a prompt reply, and also
sent me a lot of literature. I find
sure enough that we gave medical
treatment to about 43,000 heathen
the last half of 1908 and first half of
1909 in our hospitals over there.
Well, we organized a Jeffersonian
Club here last Friday night, and I
got two new subscribers today.
Get busy, Mr. Russell, from Wal
nut Grove, Alabama., organize that
Jeffersonian Club.
When in Attalla, come to see me.

HAS HAD ENOUGH OF BRYAN.
My Dear Sir: —I have just finished
your February Magazine. I have no
language to express to you my ad
miration for you as a great writer.
I love every great man the South
has produced. The truest men of
this nation today are men of the
South.
When I was a seventeen-year-old
boy I subscribed for Bryan’s Com
moner, and read it for five years.
I have read two of his books and
hundreds of his speeches, and in all
of my reading after Bryan I have
never discovered an original idea. I
quit his Commoner over a year ago,
and don’t feel that I need it any
more. I am a poor boy, and when I
have-a dollar for a paper or maga
zine it goes to men like Tom Watson
and Vardaman. I do hope Varda
man will be elected Senator from
Mississippi.
I shall be glad when you begin
your story of the South and West,
for I know it will be a glorious
theme.
A few years ago you sent me
“Bethany.” Since then I have read
the novels of Thos. Dixon and Page’s
“Red Rock,” John Esten Cooke’s
“Surry of Eagle’s Nest” thrilled my
Southern blood. All of them are
truly great novels, and when I lay
my hand on “Bethany” I can not re
frain from saying to myself: “Tom
Watson, you painted a true picture
of the Old South.”
I read your tribute to “Ruel
Wade” in the New York Magazine,
and again today in the February
Watson’s. Just as you said of him 1
can say of you: “In me you have
kindled the spark of an ambition that
will never die.”
I wish you could get another of
Harben’s novels for your Magazine
like “Pole Baker” or “Ann Boyd.” I

read “Gilbert Neal” in Uncle Re
mus’s, and I am sure Harben is a
great novelist. Can’t you get a story
from John Trootwood Moore? He is
a great writer, and I believe he is,
your friend.
You see, I read Southern books
and magazines.
I am not with Tom Watson on
everything, but there is one proposi
tion that I am with him on to the
end of the world —the South’s place
in history and literature.
I wish I could tell you just how
much you inspire me. I never lay
down one of your Magazines that I
do not face life with a firmer hope,
believing that after all life is worth
living.
Some day, when I am able, I ex
pect to buy all your books.
Your admirer,
JAMES O. WASSON.

HERE’S A BOY THAT WILL
MAKE HIS MARK.
My Dear Sir: —Since last writing
you, I have removed from Leslie to
this point for the purpose of attend
ing school. I am still hoping that I
may one day make a lawyer of my
self. I shall remain in school here
the rest of this year, after which
I shall be compelled to go to w'ork
for a livelihood. I mean to work
a year, and then attend school the
next. By doing this, I shall eventu
ally get an education, but I realize
that it will cost a lot of time and en
ergy, as well as money, but I can’t
help but believe that its all for the
best, and I mean to make one of the
hardest fights for victory any mor
tal has made. Surely by persistent
efforts, and the exercising and con
centrating of all my ability to this
purpose, some manner of success
shall chance my way. I think the
grandest of human achevements, is
not money, but honor, influence and
power. To this end I am working,
As you are a very busy man,
as I have no right to squander
BETTER THAN SPANKING.
Spanking does not cure children of
bed-wetting. There is a constitutional
cause for this trouble. Mrs. M. Sum
mers, Box 460, South Bend, Ind., wiH
send free to any mother her successful
home treatment, with full instruc
tions. Send no money, but write her
today if your children trouble you in
this way. Don’t blame the child, the
chances are it can’t help it. This treat
ment also cures adults and aged people
troubled with urine difficulties by day
or night.
