PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild O~sg now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the estallished humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the lemand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shamns by its
uimasterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of itselass. Since then we
have yielded'still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellow, Thomas Worth, Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will.appear that can offend the moseet fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BiT
TEns !" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Ben-o
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pes
sensing the remarkable qualities of Via.
saeA BITTEas in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a ToniC,

treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari

There is no cathartic for the purpose

the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same timeus
stimulating the secretions of the liver,

whatever name or nature, are literally
duW up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou.
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of mediine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelminities will free the
system from worms like thee litters.
ForFemaleComplaints, in young
or old, married or single, at thie daBwn of

i; Bitters display so decided an inlunence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blhod
whenever you find its imptitieebursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleansue it when you find it ob.
structed and sluaggish in the veins; elease
it when it is foui; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.

Ayer's
HairVigor
For restoring to Gray Hair its
natural Vitality and Color.
A dressing
which is at
once agreea
ble, healthy,
and effectual
for Ipreserv
ing the hair.
At soon re
stores faded
or gray hair
to its original
cole, with the gloss and freshness of
youth. Thin hair is thickened, fall
ang hair checked, and baklneos foften,
though not always, cured by its
use. Nothing can restore the hair
where the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
. hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the 1air with a pasty sediment, it
wit seep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gray or filling oft,
and consequently prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruif which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
Free from those deleterious sub
stances which make some prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
not harm it. If wanted merely for
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing else
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.
