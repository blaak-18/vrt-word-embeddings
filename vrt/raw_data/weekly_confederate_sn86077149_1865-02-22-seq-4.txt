FEBRUARY 22, 1S65."
UaUa and Haracij,
The anneal which we made to the press of
Rsleiffh.a few day a ago fo time m a call
for a mans meeting of the people, in order to
respond to the terma of peace, lately efifoed
by Lincoln and Seward was mad in good
faith, with an honeit and rincere purpose.
We earnestly desire, above all other con
eiderationa, the nDlon and harmony of all our
people in the straggle for liberty, which we
are new making against the invading hordes
f the enemy. We desire this above all cou
aiderations efatlf or party. To elect it, we
are willing to sink every personal er politic!
Interest, feeling or prejudice. . Wn belie
the interest nay, the very fa frty of society
itself, demand this "union and hanneny.
In reply to om appeal, the Standard of
Feb. 14th, after quoting oar remarks, in thee
words "Before expressing the sentiments
with which these propositions intprers us, we
wait to see whether those who have hereto
fore differed from us, will iffer w hopes of
united action," rsays;
"And before the Standard appeared, and
before it could have responded favorably to
this overture, even had it been disposed to
do so, tho followiDg was posted cn the bulle
tin board of the Confederate, as a sort of com
mentary on some news from Kinston :
Tae Otandmrd and rjret, the ring-leaders
of the croaker in North Carolina, are chioOj
responsible tot the invasion of our State by the
eaemj in feree at this time."
The Standard evidentl misunderstood our
remarks, above quoted. What we meant by
declaring onr purpose to withhold "the eenti-
Ktots with which the propositions impress
He," &., was, simplj, that w.e Intended to
leave to others to pioneer in the denunciation
of Lincoln'! terms. Believing, as we did,
that every press, edited by a man who had the
. soul of a man, would at onee denounce the
degrading proposition, we preferred In follow
the lead sf those who had heretofore opposed
the adminiatration ; being content to f.tU
behind, if tnereby, wn eoald snore effectually
push on tho great interests of tho country.
The Standard com plains that, while our
propesition waa pending, tho article above
quoted (whish is a sentence from a letter of a
correspondent) waa posted on the bulletin
board of the Confederate ;" and it eayr:
" The publio will perceive from the forego
ing the terms on which union and harmony in
thiscrifis is proposed. The Standard, with
the " hideous mark " upon its brow, placed
there in 1881 by the State Journal, in pursu-'
nnce of orders from the Destructive leaders,
and with this fresh insult thrown iu its face,
is asked so unite with these who hTe thus
treated it, in a more vigorous prosccutien cf
the 'rtttt. We ay be subjugated, but wo
will never lick: the hand that smites us. Wo
will never unite with a set of men who hare
prooeanoed,and who still pronounce us traitors
to oar native land, and who, judging by the
past, would sneer at any sacrifice we might
snake in the cause of the country, if did not
happen to agree with them in every thing, and
ooecde to Mem the right to hold all the offices
and conduct tho war in their own way."
If these be the real feelings of the Standard,
we reeogaiae some justness in them, though
inscfStient t swerve a patriot io man from
the cause of his country, aud for the sake
of tho cause; and in the same spirit of
aelf-sserlfice which wonld prompt ua to
yield all we have to it, we will proceed to re-,
move the above impression, so far as the writer
f this is oeacerned.. Tho letter of our corres
pondent waa not seen by him before it was
posted. He was not aware of the portion
complained of ; and if ho had been, it would
ot have been placed om the ' board, for there
aro naany things which wo would feel
obliged to admit into our paper from a cor
respondent, which we would not transfer to
tho bulletin-board. And 'oven by these
thrcogh whose agency it was placed there, it
was done inadvertently. More than this. Wo
aro prepared to say, to the Standard: if we
shall bofennd aide by side, advocating and
defending our country, and uasiiting in the
icreo eoniict for freedom, "no hideous
mark' or any other mark will be received
froaa ui. Whatever lies along tho path of the
past, connected with our publio relation,
shall b; buried there, Aa for tho tho ofSeee,
we depise them ; and our conduct has shown
that wc care not who holds them, provided he
holds them for the country. And, as we have
never objected to fair criticism on the conduct
of the war, so we may safely promise not to do
so, whenever that criticiem emanates from a
right spiritand has for ita object, the farther-
aL83 cf tho cause.
Tho foregoing concession is made to all
those who may feel as the Standard seems to
feel. It is a concession to tho absolute
needs of the country for the eako of united
action in order to draw the people together
again, it is m tho interests of tho Stan-
dard, and those whom it represents, that this
union ahonld take place or, by no manner
of means, can it escape the universal destruc
tion which will ensue upon subjugation, and
by this time, it ought to see, that now, end
hereafter, ' nothing short of subjugation, on
the one hand, or independence en the other
can befal the natien, Whatever of sacrifice of
personal feeling we have made in this article,
is made for the sake ef the country. . It is
the duty of natriotism to make' any sacrifice.
Aa to the arming of tho negro, we differ
entirely with the Standard; but we admit it
to bo a subject for discussion about which
there may bo honest differences of oalaion.
Let the States decide.
The next preposition of the Standard "to
submit to the people, at the ballot-box, the
question whether they will continue the war
indefinitely for Independence, or resume their
former position in the Union under the Con
stitution and lawa of the United States' is
"objected" to, because the people havnot the

and laws'of the United Stas, ' because the
Constitution has been amended so as to'abo'
ih th-ir property in slaves ; and laws hare
been passed confiscating their property in.
land ; and Mr. Lincoln said to Mr. Hunter,
that it would depend on Congress whether
wc would over be allowe4 to have a Congres
sional delegation
But we are willing to submit to the people
whether they will fight for independence, cr
submit to Lincoln. Or we are billing to take
the last proposition of the Standard to "let
every administration man, and every original
secessionist, and every war- nan from seven
teen to sixty, at once volunteer, fill up our de
pleted regiments, or tender themselves in com
panies or regiments for the service. Let them
do this, and our word for it tne peace men
will join them." We lake the above proposi
tion to be sincerely made; and that the meaning
of it is, that both shall begin this good work
the wr men and the peace men the adminis
tration men and the peace men the original
accession' sts and the peace men.
Now, we know no two menwhe can more ap
propriately set the example no two who can
begin "to rattle the dry bones" better-than oor-
self and the editor of the Standard. Lfc us
begin. Let it be we two, who raise tne cry
cine boys." We wish the Standard both te
advise and act. We are prepared to do bota.
Let the meeting then be held ; and let us
take the lead. Such a lead will insure follow-
ers.
It will be gratifying to the public, we doubt
not, to seo that the Standard is now met cn its
own terms; and there ia a prospect of " Union
and Harmony." . If there be not, jt will not be
our fault. Let the day of the meeting be fixed.
(exteaot ) 29th Jan. 1865.
" Notwithstanding the darkness of the tour,
as regards the military aspect, I can t help
picturing to myself toe future grandeur or our
Confederacy. It the croakers would only quit
croaking, and the papers stop talking about
foreign recognition and ''allegiance, "negotia
tion " and 8uca nonsense, and the whole coun
try tell the abolitionists, like John Paul Jones,
that " we've just begun to right," l tain
peace would soon follow. ' There
is nothing better for young bloods than etriet
military discipline. When our independence
is established, I think our government ought to
organize a large standing amy, and' require
all young men to serve three years in it. It
might be maintained I think, by cfforiDg a
good education to young men for three years
service in the army. Upon my word, 1 thins
nothing would tend more to give stability te
the government, and hardiness to the race.
All we lack here (Petersburg) having a per
fect army is uniform, clothing and abundant
rations; but the proper standard or military
pride cannot bo reached without these, and
without something to keep up an intense sol
dierly pride, perfect discipline is impractica
ble."
We received from a rained friend, the other
day, the above eitraot from a letter, whioh he
had received from one of the brave youths, hot
yet 20 years old, who aro serving the country
in the trenches around Petersburg ; and the
sentiments are so noble, so full of true courage
and whole-souled patriotism, that we laylt be
fore our readers.
We should like .also to publish the whole
letter, which accompanied it, but we do net
feel at liberty to do so. It comes from a man
who has rendered more useful service to the State
than any man in her borderet one whote whole
life, hat been devoted io the good cf eecieiy and the
Staie and whose name will be accepted for
honor and reverence, by other, as it has been,
by this generation. This writer says :
' Onr only - danger ia treason and faction
fostering cowardice. We c-n be subjugated
only by being recreant to ourselves. Yet, aa
cloud thickens to others, the ekies are brigh
tening to me. Because I trust not in horses,
chariots or men especially the men of Eu
rope but in the Lord of Hosts, the God of
Battles, who will not suffer the wicked always
to trinmph ; who eets up one, and puts down
another, of His own good will, and right, and
pleasure ; who gives victory to those for whom
He has a favor, and who regards those that
put their trust in Him. Is not the past and
present year's discipline gradually bringing
our people to a just sense cf their true ftepen
dtnee especially ;our christian people to a
penitent and confident, looking to Him who
rules the armies ef earth as well as Heaven.-
This done He will turn to us again and cause
His face to shine, and wo shall be saved."
The Yankee Gen. Terry and Union Men.
The Goldeboro' State Journal announces
tho flight of a Mr. Swain to the Yankeee, and
states, on information received, that he ap
plied to Gen. Terry for protection. on the
ground that he has always been a Union man,
acd hail managed, tinder one pretence or
another, to evade senrioe in the armies of the
Confederate States. Gen. Terry, who Bet-ma "
to bo a practical .Yankee, replied that he had
ne Bpecialuao, except one, for cea who were
too cowardly to atand &p for their country,
right or wrong, when invaded, and that waa
to give tbem a musketjand make them fight.
Mr. Swain was accordingly placed in the
ranks of the Federal army. This should he
a warning to the recusant soldiers jand Union
suckers generally. Iftiiey wtU not fight for
the South he will be wade to fight for the Forth.
They must choose whom they shall serve, the
Yankees or their own people.

Tt wa ArdAvoA that ohnvn t ahular statement be publuhed one time eft eh In the folloirlair papers :
Daily and Weekly Conservative, the Daily and Weekly Confederate, and the Weekly Standard, Fay
ctteville Observer. Wilmington Journal, Wadesboro' Argus, Western Democrat, Salisbury Wateh-
Political Adteettsements. The Yan
kees have prohibited the publication f '"'Per
sonals" in tho N. Y. News, which had made
I an arrangement with the Richmond Enquirer
by which information as to prisoners, dsc,
was conveyed to friends in either country.
The prohibition is on the ground that the
" Personals " has afforded opportunity of po
litical communication in cypher. The News
corrects the notion and says that such commu
nication would be made easier and safer through
an advertisement for a servant, or a lost pock-et-boek
or stray horse in the columns of the
Heralds Tribune a remark which the En
quirer sustains by the following statement of
enrioas facts:
fThe expedition for the relief of the pri
soners -on Johnson's Island was planned,
organized and arranged through the Help
column of the Herald; and that for the cap
tme ef the Chesapeake vras also planned
through the same medium of communication.
The privilege of advertising in behalf ef hu
manity which the enemy's government -permitted
through the columns of the "News"
protected that paper from any advertisements
which communicated information. This last
and little act of despotism may inflict some
pecuniary loss upon the "Newa'' at the ex
pense of unnecessary sorrow and affliction to
innocent persons, but it will not close the
gaeat channel of communication offered by the
Herald to all who choose to pay for thena.-r-The
Herald has reaped more of the reward
of treason, and given more aid and comfort
to the enemy of its country than any ten
papers ia the United States. We suggest to
the Herald to employ Gen. Scott to take and
administer the oath to every person offering
an advertisement, as the only way to choke
off tho Confederate allies in New York. Cin

TafiUOHES, PaTEB8BUBO. VA.,
February 7, 1866.
Ms. Editor : There was an enthusiastic
meeting held in Ransom's Brigade, yesterday
to give utterance to their views upon the pres
ent crisis of our national affairs ; and the fol
lowing gentlemen being called upon, ably and
eloquently responded Colonel L. M. McAfee,
49th N. a, Mar T. D. Lore, 24th N. C,
and Captain 3. H. Gee -A. A. General, aad
several others, breathing tones of defiance to
the enemy, and resolve akin to the spirit
which animated us in 1861.
The meeting unanimously adopted resolu
tions of resistance, and called upon the citl
a?ns at homo to be true to themselves and
tboir honor ; to forward all deserters to the
army; and gave soma pretty severe thrusts
into those systeaatio gentleman of our Legis
lature, who are bo eloquent upon tho suffer
ings of magistrates and militia officers ia oar
State. x
I do hope that this spirit in the army will
arouse our people, make them shake off their
lethergy, and be men, let the croakers and
skulkers moan as they may in the abject cow
ardise of their shameful timidity.
If the peace Commissioners return, as I
fear they w ill, with terms which an honored
people can never think oi submitting to, It
must have a beneficial effect, and I think it
will, in uniting our people firm and steady as
faith from on high.
Hastily, - Umus.
Deserter Killed.
The Heme Guard in Capt. Hall's district in
Iredell county,, says the Express, were out
scouting one day last week, and captured a
eouple of deserters from Wilkes county,
brothers, by the name of Alexander. Wild,
another from the same county, who attemp
ted to eecape, was sbet and died io a few mo
ments . A just retribution.
