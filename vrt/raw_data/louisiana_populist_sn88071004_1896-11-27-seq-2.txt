Our thoughtful and mature read -
era will be thrilled, we believe, by
"Nemo's" article this bwuek. As
far as we know there is nowhere
in literature a similar grouping of
things to be thankfu for. We
think we can detect throughout the
prayer a veiled argument from na
ture for the existence of God. We
arepermitted to explain that "Ne
mo is engaged in busines, and
that his weekly letter is the result
of the utilization of spare morn
ing and evening moments.

Some time ago a gentleman
from ward 2 of this parish came
to the Banner office and made a
trsdo with us to publish a notice
of final proof to his homestead.
The application was properly sent
dowa by our clerk of court with
,direions to return it to the Ban-'
cer of Liberty, but the notice has
never reached s yet. Last week
another gentleman from ward b
came in and made arrangements
-ordhe same kind of a job. The
rslt was the same, and last week
it ppeaed in the columns of the
te . We eomrlted the clerk
r. J.H. .Tiln e) in ach case
to aseia n the cause and e stt
edthat, " the Be r at N·tbi
toche chimed tebas d he rigbt to
cooe between papers; had ben
patrmeis the Signal a long time
and did not care to change." This
y be law but we do not beleve
it possible for such an unjust law
to be in the statut of the United
estate-- Ba r of Liberty.

A LAYMAN'S THANKSGIVING.
Oh, great Architect of the in
finite, to whom a thousand years
are as a day, we ephemeral, van- t
ishing creatures bow before Thee t
in quiet, humble thanks.
For immeasurable space, so ex
tensive that the most cunning de- I
vices of men turn us back defeat
ed from all attempts to set its
bounds; for the weight of our
world and of all the other won- i
derous, unsupported, circling bo
dies, so ponderous that the human I
mind reels in computation, we
thank Thee, Thou who art power. 4
For the accurate movement of I
each star, revolving in its orbit
with precision indescribable; for I
the visible voice of the heavens,
our perennial time-piece; for the ,
inclination of the axis of our
world, so cunningly devised to
give comfort and advantage in the
changing seasons and the broaden
ed area of habitation, we thank
Thee, Thou who art order.
Oh, thou Mechanic of the infin
itesimal, we who are not the least
of all Thy creatures enter Thy
presence with praise.
For the perfect detail in the
short-lived gnat, dancing in the
hght of the dying day; for the
structural adaptation of those crea
tures that escape our vision save
as the eyes are aided by the micro
scope; for the pervasivenesee of"
life, things even that die being the
sustamers of things that live; for
the evasiveness of life, so that af
ter all research we give up foiled
in every attempt to find a natural
origin for life in the tiniest atom;
for all these things we thank Thee,
Thou who art life.
For or own bodies, sacred be
nuse they are Thy handiwork, so
brief in their endurance and yet so
potential because of the blessing
or sorrow we pas to those who
come after us; for our brains and
their power to eat us on the apex
of all living things; for thought
and its products in solid form that
are seen in every direction; for the
chalenge to effort that comes from
the elusive secrets of nature; for
the power to conquer and trans
form this inert world beneath our
feet, we thank Thee, Thou who
art snpreme intelligence.
Oh, thou Mind of the universe,
we who detect in ourselves free-will
sad a indirkldual consciousnes
that separates us from the beasts
and givesu as aems of kinddhip
with Thee, approach Thee with a

For all great disasters that dlec

feeling that the family life is a sa

thank Thee, Thou who art Love.
For all maiden women who with
hearts of flesh sanctified to human

the sick, the bereft, the orphan ;
for all the helpful ministrations of
those full of Divine self-denial
who bury their sorrow to turn a
sunshine face to the world, we
thank Thee, Thou satisfier of hearts
that yearn to be filled.
For the great Teacher, the Eman
cipator of mind, the Founder, the
Center, the Secret of all that is
lovely and of- good report in our I
later civilization ; for the Moral I
Monarch, the Prince of Peace, be- I
fore whose mild might the pagan
isms of Rome and of Greece shiv
ered into fragments; for Him
whose power is not shortened to a
tame the heart of fire, till the lion
within us lieth down with the
Lamb, we thank Thee, who hast
made Thyself comprehensible to us
in human form.
We bow in wondering awe be
fore Thee, apparent in these Thy I
works both great and small, save a
to the fool, blinded, deaf, and un- I
responsive. Thou spiritual em
bodiment of power, order, iife in
telligence, love, hear the breathings
of our hearts as we sink into si- I
lence before Thee. Our voices die
within us. Sustain us till we step
upward from this dim, mysterious
sojourning place into Light.
ENATOR BUTLER SERVES I
NOT1UE
If Mr. Bryan Leads Reform For
ces in 1900 it Must not be as
a Democrat.
From the Raleigh Caucasian (Pub
lished by Senator Butler.
It is probably idle to go back
now and review the causes which
led to the defeat of Mr. Bryan
but the chiefest among them all
was the brutal stupidity of the
goldbug nominee for Vice Presi
dent in declining to retise from
the national ticket supported by
those forces declaring for reform.
It may not be altogether correct
to assert that this stupidity iis the
sole cause of defeat, but it is cer
tain that many people who favor
reform could not be persuaded to
believe in the sincerity of such a
man as Arthur Sewall, and we
have no hesitation in saying they
were right. We have asserted be
fore that he was put on the tick
et by the schemers to defeat it,
and we say so now. The object
for which he was put up has been
aecomplished.
Another cause of the defeat was
the failure of the party represent
ed by the Chicago Coavention to
support the Bryan ticket. If tbhat
party had given two-thirdis as many
votes to Bryan as it gave to Cleve
lad four years ago, Bryan would
have iben elected.
The announcement now comes
that Mr. Bryan declares he will
continue to ight the battle of re
form. It is well, perhaps, that
he willdomso. Heisanable lead
er, and it may be that none can
ao be foondto equal him. But
gret events can be evolved within
he next four years, and, speak
lag now for the People's party of
North Carolira, and we believe for
the nation, we take the liberty tof
mrvi notice upon Mr. Bryan
-. ifhe desires tos head the re
foterm forces of the People's party
l, the next ight he most doso
uader some other name than that
of Derorat. Thatnamehas be
ean a reproach sad a steach'
among the peoplle, and it will not
,be supporltedl any lore'e now nor
leren:ifter.
I Demollcrats had (Iha"g ,' of tlhe
goverlnment for nea:rly foulr volrs,
andl they playle theI leople false- 4
grossly and brutally false. In the
campaign just closed the People's
party joined forces with the Demo- B
crats and the Democrats again
played the people false-grossly
and brutally false. There is
no virtue in them. We are
done with them now and forever,
and also with any man who seeks
to lead the people hereafter under
anything that may bear the name
or have the smirch of the word
Democrat on it.
Help the Farmers.
Editor Populist :-In view of
the widespread want produced in
our parish by the drouth this last
summer, it seems to me there should
be some attempt made to relieve
the hardships that will fall upon
the farmers. I know our police
jury has done all in its power by
distributing some food stuffs among
those who are worst off, but that is
not sufficient. If every dollar
brought from the cotton made in
most of the parish was spent for
supplies next year, there would
not be enough to keep the people
in rations until another crop can
be made. In all the hill part of
the parish, corn was almost a com- c
plete failure, and nearly every dol
lar that came from the sale of the
little cotton made is owing to the
merchants on the supply bill on
which the crop was made. There
will be but little money to spare to
buy corn with, but corn must be
had, and I think the merchants of
the towns tributary to the Texas
and Pacific railroad should united- I
ly go to work to get the road to
haul the corn at the lowest possi
ble figure, and the merchants ought
to be willing to let the farmers
have the corn without profit, de- I
pending upon the greater output
of the crop in the coming year--I
mean where the corn is sold for
cash, and where it is sold on time
the charge should only be sufficient
to cover the use of the money
tied up. Our people are in much
greater need than those who have
not been among them can imagine.
There are families who at this time
have not a barrel of corn in their
cribes and a long and probably
hard winter before them. Let
some public spirited man take the
lead in this matter, and others will
do their duty immediately. The
farmers prosperity means more
for the merchants and others who
make their living by non-produc
tive professiondand when our farm
ers suffer other professions are
bound to suffer later on.
I hope these few lines will get
someone to move in the matter,
who can have some influence with
the transportation companies, for
they can do much to relieve the
people in this their day of trial
and hardship.
Respectfully, A. TETTS.
