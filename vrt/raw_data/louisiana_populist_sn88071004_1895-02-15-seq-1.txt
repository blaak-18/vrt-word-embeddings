Lesson, InBondsa.
It-is imp,nt that the people
s~Ilorasp this bond.idea. Here F
is an object lesson. The original
bonded debt of. the bUnited States
was $2,600,000,000, on which has d
been paid about $4.400,000,000.
Yet, despite this vast sum already
paid, the.debt is still.,one-tbird as
large as it was when first.contract
ed, and now that the gold standard
has been adopted it will require as
Smuch taxation and labor to pay off
the remnaining.one-third of the na
tional debt as tolhave paid off the
entire debt prior to 1873. With
this appalling condition before him
President Cleveland coolly propoe- g
em to add to the indebtedness $500,
000,000 in bonds, running fifty i
years at 3 per cent, payable prin- ta
cipal and interest in gold. The
Sinterest on this sum for 50 years [
will be $750,000,000, And what
are the people to get in return for I
this frightful addition to the pub- u
lie debt? Here is Mr. Cl veland's
proposal: The proceeds from the
sale of the $,00,000,000 of bonds g
- areto be usneed in taking up and fi
canceling an equal amount of out
standing legal tender notes. These (j
bonds are to be receivable at the
treasury as security at their par n
value for national bank circulation, a
The interest amounting to $15,- gi
,00-,0,000 a year, goes of course to ea
the banks which hold them. The
bank circulation is to take the nc
place of the cancelled legal tenders. ti(
Now the point in all this is that the at
banks are to be paid $15,000O,0U)O a cc
.year for furnishing to the country hi
$500,000,000 of paper money at
w hich it now gets for nothing. n
In other words, the legal tender lip
notes now outstanding, and which
do not cost a cent of Interest are di
to be destroyed and hank paper
not a whit better if as good, is to
he substituted and paid for at the
rate of $15,0,oO.001) a year or $750,
04),000t) in fifty years. After hav- t1
. ing paid the banks the enormous e
sum of $750,ý4flN,000 for kindly a'
allowing us to use their due bills b4
for currency, we will still owe the it
original $500,0(),0C)O in bonds. e,
And this is the scheme that is urg- ft
ed upon congress in a panicky
message by the president, which is c
approved as "wise finance" by all i]
the daily newspapers of this city, to
and which we are told by the
"able financiers" of the John
Sherman stripe is absolutely ne
cessary to save the country from
ruin. Just why the country should
le.saved now to be devoured later P
is not explained. How any one, tl
except national bank stockholders e
and national bank officers can 1
approve this scheme is a mystery. I1
Simply to state the proposition, t4
should he sufficient to secure its a
condemnation in the mind of every 0
honest man. If carried out the
Cnited States, at the end of fifty )
years, will be able to say in the e
language on the tombstone over a 1'
confiding patient: "1 was well, I
became sick, I took (bank) physic, ii
and here I am'!-Nonconformist. c

Can we find an economic system that

numbers of hcads-great manafactur
