THE RESURRECTION OF CONSCIENCE
Conscience can never die. The
murderer may lift his knife and
plunge it deep in the bosom of youth
and of innocence. His deed of hor
ror may never be known to the world
nor to any friends about him. He
may have all his wants met, and all
his wishes gratified. He may spend
his days among the polite, the gay,
and the learned, or he may travel the
lands beyond the sea, and forget, in
the pleasures of his journeyings the
act of infamy committeed in other
years. But to his wanderings and
his reveries there will come an end.
The pain of disease will make him
think of the days of health and pros
perity. The needle, jostled and con
fused for a moment, at last settles
down into a fixed position. The wide

AFTER ALI
After all is said concerning the
value of books, the final word re
mains to be spoken when the Bible
is considered. That Book stands in
the world today in a unique position.
There are floodtides of books of
every kind sweeping in upon all the
shorelines of the intellectual life of
humanity. In the midst of this
boundless sea may be discovered the
influence of the Holy Scripture flow
ing as an ocean current out of the
depths and from almost everywhere,
and yet definitely located with life
and movement and goal.
If the influence of the Bible was
removed from all literature, we
would have something left like the
wreckage of the Tower of Babel.
We hail the announcement with
delight that the people are reading
the Bible more than ever before.
There is an increase in the number
of Bibles published in all those lan
guages where great Bible societies
are organized. The presses that pro

do not have to consider the possi

MEXICO AND I
Mexico is older than the United
States, several hundred years, and is
five hundred years behind this coun
try in civilization, Christianity and
education. There are 14,000,000 or
15,000,000 people in that country, and
counting out Americans and Eng
lishmen, 95 per cent of them (if not
infidels), are Catholics. There are
thousands of priests and nuns, and
sisters, and many parochial (so
called) schools where the Catholic re
ligion is the chief thing taught.
Rome did own one-third of the best
property in that country, and paid no
taxes. Think of heathenism, bar
barism, superstition, poverty, crime,
outlawry, and priestcraft, and all
that sort of thing, and your thoughts
naturally turn to Mexico. Mexico
was founded as a Catholic country,
and behold conditions. All Rome
ruled countries are the same.
The United States was settled,
founded and built by protestants, and
behold—what do you see? The com
parison of Romanism and Protestant

built around this sacred Book there
is nothing that can destroy it.
Then again, the Bible has been
translated into a large number of
languages. It carries its influence
into whatever nation and among
whatever people it goes. Homer has
been translated into more than a
score of foreign languages and
Shakespeare into nearly 40. Both
these literary men fell far short of
the number of translations of the
Bible, for the Gospel has been ac
tually printed in more than 700 dif
ferent forms of human speech, and
the Bible societies, as they share the
work of translation, have helped to
spread the message in 558 languages
and dialects.
Speak of it as we may, depreciate

stands the fact that of all the flood
of books that has arisen in the in

Thus there has come a whole crop
of editorials recently along three
lines—first, that the Jews did not
kill the Czar; second, that the Jew

others; third, that the Jews are great
farmers.
As to the first, every government
now has proof not only that the Czar
and bis family were killed upon ex
press orders of the Jews but that the
actual deed was wrought upon the
man, his invalid son, his wife and
daughters by a Jew. As to the sec
ond, we are still waiting patiently
for the record which the American
Jewish committee so long ago prom

“farmers” like the notorious Samuel
Untermeyer and others of his ilk
have very large estates. You can see
them for miles along the lordly Hud

KLANS AID IN CHURCH
Youngstown, Ohio, Dec. 22.—A
strong plea for a United Protestant
ism was made by the Rev. A. H. Grif
fith, local pastor, in a sermon in
which he declared the Ku Klux Klan
is waging a fight against an organ
ization which is seeking to break
down the rule of America by Amer
icans.
“Protestants are divided into 195
denominations,” he said. “Again it
a divided Protestant church we have
a united Catholic church and a
united Jewish church. United, there
would be a great saving. In our
neighborhood there are six Protestant
churches within a mile of each other.
A united church could speak with one
voice.”
“There ;s an organization in our
land seeking to break down the free
institutions of America,” he contin
ued. “In our city a man is penal
ized for being an American and
obeying the laws of God and the
state. He opens a store in our city,
keeps the law of God and the land,
by closing on the Sabbath. He is
penalized by having a competitor
open a store who keeps open seven
days a week, in open violation of the
law of God and the state. This is
true of every motion picture theater
in the city and parks. This invisible
organization is seeking to drive the
Bible from our public schools, to
make it a sealed book.

felt it was safest of all to editorial
ize upon the point that the Jews are
becoming farmers. The editorials
doubtless are a reflection of the
thought that it would be a good
thing for multitudes of Jews to do
also a reflection of good will toward
them in doing it. But the fact is not
as stated; every effort to turn the
Jew to the soil has failed, or where
farming communities have been es
tablished they have been kept alive
only by a large expenditure of money
and a constant supply of Jews who
leave the land as soon as their pov
erty permits. It is further alarming
to see how whole agricultural dis
tricts are falling into the hands of
Jewish commission men who are be
coming the go-betweens for farmer
and citizen. This is a condition
which has led to trouble in every
country, and should be avoided here.
However, it is not to discuss such
that these lines are writ

the enlarging wedge of pro-Jewish
propaganda of an entirely question
able type which is steadily being
inserted into American newspapers.
Editors should change the system
which makes them mere hoppers into
which all sorts of “copy” can be
thrust. That system only makes
them accessories to the wholesale de

• SOME SCHOOLS
(The Missouri Valley Independent)
Tammany Hall, New York city, has
at last gobbled the public schools of
that city, and the people are having
a time. Tammany has selected and
elected the board of education, and
the board being three-fourths Roman,
has been busy “cleaning house” for
about a year. Many faithful and
competent superintendents, male and
female, are being reduced in rank or
dismissed, and Catholics, many of
whom have had no experience, save
in the' lower grades, raised to super
intendents, from salaries of SIOO or
$125 to $l5O, $175, S2OO per month.
Only last week two young women,
teaching only a few years, just out
of Catholic schools, were made super
intendents.
A meeting of the teachers was
called to discuss the situation and
about one-third of the staff, all Pro
testants, were present, not a Roman
ce. They discussed and “cussed”
conditions, and finally got up a set of
resolutions of protest to present to
the board, and a copy to be sent to
the governor, the mayor and others.
Of course, it will be pigeonholed.
It is said that 75 per cent of the
teachers are Catholics, while only
about 25 per cent of the pupils are
Catholic in that city. Slowly all good
places held by Protestants are being
filled by Romans.
The teachers said that at present
rate in ten years there will not be a
Protestant teacher or superintendent
in the public schools of that city.
And yet Rome is tolerant, not bigot
ted, nor selfish, and above all things
is not in politics. Chicago is going
the same way, but hardly so rapidly
as in New York city.
Another thing, in some of the
schools nuns and sisters are teachers,
and they wear the abominable cloth
ing, and use very largely Catholic
text books.
More. In New York and Chicago
thousands upon top of thousands of
dollars of the school fund money is
paid to parochial and other Roman
schools end colleges.

ious middle West, like to live in

dren to educate? We have very lit

Peoria, 111.—Peoria Klan caused
the “Big Hollow Inn” to be raided
last Friday. “Big Hollow” is located
on the Knoxville state road about 10
miles out of the city of Peoria. It
has long been understood that the
Inn was running unlawfully but it
seemed hard to find just whom to ar
rest. The name of the bartender was
finally ascertained and, as sufficient
evidence had been secured by the
Klan to warrant the raid, the federal
officers went in Monday and found
three barrels of beer, and a quantity
of wine and whiskey.
Many a parched throat must now
wait until its owner climbs the hill
and travels to where the Klan has
not yet penetrated, or quenches his
thirst with the God-given drink of
“Adam’s Ale.”
Samples were previously secured
and tests will be made of these, as
well as of the property "ecured, to
hold in evidence for the court.
Defendants in liquor cases are now

TURNING A MOUNTAIN INTU A MONUMENT
The machinery to be used in carv
ing Gutzon Borglum’s great Civil War
memorial on the face of Stone Mount
ain, near Atlanta, Georgia, is de
scribed and illustrated in The Iron
Trade Review (Cleveland) by A. J.
Hain, of its editorial staff. This en
terprise, usually treated from th*e
artistic standpoint, is also an en
gineering feat, and it is as such that
it appeals to Mr. Hain. Borglum is
himself an engineer, and served as an
apprentice machinist, a draftsman
and an architect before he became a
sculptor. In fact, Mr. Hain tells us,
mechanical engineering and the art
of the sculptor are combining to an
unusual extent and in a unique man
ner to produce this memorial. In
fact—
“ When Gutzon Borglum, sculptor,
conceived the idea of carving out a
great frieze, representing a moving
mass of troops across the face of the
mountain, in full or high relief, he
started a project that may develop a
masterpiece of mechanical ingenuity
as well as what was intended pri
marily—the greatest monument ever
constructed by the hand of man.
“On this largest single body of
granite in the world, there first was
the artist’s visionary picture of the
South’s Civil War patriots, troops
and cavalrymen passing in review be
fore the leaders of ‘the lost cause.’ In
heroic size they were moving over
the crest of the mountain, at the right
and winding down the side toward
the left, disappearing in a thick foli
age of trees. It was a sublime pano
rama, to be viewed many miles away,
and to last through all the ages.
“The cliff oii which this was pic
tured is 700 feet high, and the line
of troops was more than 1,800 feet
long. The mountain rises almost
perpendicularly. The picture revealed
the Army coming over the top and
descending into shadowy vale below.
“Imagination apparently took no
heed of physical limitations in plac
ing such massive figures, some 200
feet high, on a mountain train. Mak
ing them appear as lifelike as tho
moulded in true proportions seemed
too fanciful, until engineering skill,
with steel and machinery, was called
upon to give the vision substance and
reality.
“To understand what is being at
tempted,* it is necessary to appreciate
the size of the granite block with
which the engineers, the sculptor and
their assistants have to work. Stone
Mountain is 867 feet high from plain
to highest crest. It is over 5,000 feet
long, seven miles around the base,
and over a mile from base to summit
up one of its gradual slopes. It is
composed entirely of the finest, im
perishable building granite. At
tempts to break it up by means oY
blasting have failed. On the north
side, where the memorial will be
carved, there is a sheer cliff, 700 feet
high.
“The memorial is to be carved 400
feet below the simmit, and will occu
py a space 200 feet high and 1,800
feet long. The figure of General Lee
will be approximately 140 feet from
the top of his hat to the bottom of
his horse’s hoofs. A man standing
on the general’s shoulder would need
a stepladder to reach his ear.
“The first step in working out the
plan is for the sculptor to model sec
tions of the frieze in clay. A pho
tographic lantern slide is made of
each section. The image is projected
by means of a high-powered lantern
on the side of the mountain, at night.
“It was at first intended to use a
light-sensitive material on the gran
ite, and to impress the image on this
photographically, but it was decided
to paint the figures, somewhat as a
signboard is painted.
“The figures will be cut on the
mountain, roughly at first, by means
of pneumatic drills operated on the
platforms of huge pantographs. The
operators will have before them re
POPE ANNOUNCES
SOVEREIGN CLAIM
IN PAPAL STATES
—K-K-K
All Eyes of Europe Focussed Upon
Mussolini. Statement is Issued in
Vatican Official Qrgon.
—K-K-K
Rome.—Like a thundrebolt from a
clear sky, the Observatore Romano,
the Vatican’s official newspaper, says
the five papal states that disappeared
from the map in 1870, are still under
the territorial sovereignty of the
pope, and that the question is by no
means settled, neither has it been
abandoned.
This statement was made public af
ter several Italian newspapers follow
ing the visit of the Spanish king to
the vqtican and quirnal, stated the
relation between the church and state
were the best, and that the problem
of the states of the church had been
settled.
Statement by Vatican
The Vatican official organ in a long
editorial affirms that, if the Vatican
“permitted the Catholic king to visit
Rome despite the abnormal conditions
created for the Vatican on the unfor
tunate day of September 20, 1870, it
was not because the holy see re
nounces its undeniable rights (to ter
ritorial sovereignty over Rome), but
because of the great desire to pro
mote peace and harmony upon the
plicas of the original clay models.
They will take measurements from the
models, and will drive their drills into
the granits, according to scale read
ings. Several pantographs are being
constructed so that the operators will
be enabled to adjust their positions
as the work progresses. The final
and finer sculpturing will be done by
dorglum and his assistants.
“A telephone system will be de
vised whereby observers at distant
points will communicate with the
sculptors and direct them where to
apply their drills and chisels. Borg
lum will execute the details of the
features of Gen. Robert E. Lee and
others making up the principal group
in the memorial.
“The entire frieze will cover ap
proximately 200,000 square feet on
the mountain, and it is estimated will
take about seven years to complete.
“Five pantographs at an elevation
of 357 feet will be supported from
steel trusses anchored in the side of
the mountain. Each consists essen
tially of a turntable, running on rails,
to the under side of which is attached
an inverted steel tower, 110 feet long.
At the lower end of the tower will
be pivoted the arm of the pantograph,
223 feet long. At the outer extremity
of the arm will be attached steel
counterweights to balance the plat
form, 16 feet square, and its load, at
the other end.
“The pantograph will be raised or
lowered by cables running around a
drum at the top of the inverted tow
er. The tower can be swung around
drawing the platform away from or
moving it against the face of the
mountain.
“The platform carries the electrical
controls that enables one man to
place the pantograph in any desired
position. Each platfbrm will bfe
equipped with a batter of 12 pneu
matic drills supported on tripods. The
surface of the mountain will be in
cised in some places to a depth of 24
feet or more. The granits will be cut
away as nearly as possible in the
form of blocks, and will not be al
lowed to fall, but will be lowered by
means of a derrick. It is estimated
that $1,000,000 worth of granite will
thus be obtained. It will be used in
constructing an amphitheater at the
base of the mountain, which, with a
hall of records, is part of the memor
al plan.
“For raising and lowering men and
tools, and for lowering the granite as
it is cut from the mountain, a travel
ing crane will be operated on tracks
laid on the upper part of the truss
es. A considerable amount of the
preliminary work has been necessary,
and this is of a hazardous character.
“Men have been lowered over the
precipice in slings, by means of steel
cables, and they have driven holes in
the face of the mountain and cut
out granite blocks with pneumatic
drills.
“As impractical and fantistic as
the carving of the memorial may seem
it has been pronounced feasible by,
and has engaged the attention of,
some of America’s foremost engi
neers. Its very nature, difficulties
and dangers have spurred on the
sculptor-engineers.
“Perhaps the project might never
have been started if it were not for
the fact that Gutzon Borglum has
the view-point of the engineer, as
well as that of the sculptor.
“Tools, motors and some of the
other machinery used in constructing
the memorial, and records of the
work and historical data will be
walled up in the memorial hall, per
haps to be taken out many thousands
of years in the future with as much
curiosity as attended the opening of
the tomb of Tut-Ankh-amen. The
mountain is said by geologists to be
impervious to the elements. It is part
of the same stratum of granite that
underlies he city of Atlanta.’—The

The Observatore Romano says that
the Vatican still is looking for a satis
factory solution of the Roman ques
tion.
Chides Italian Press
The Journal concludes by saying
that it is unkind, to say the least, on
the part of the newspapers to assert
that the encyclic letter used by Pope
Benedict XV three years ago, called
“Pasem Del Munus,” which was made
the visit of Catholic rulers possible
to Rome, was an act of renunciation
on the part of the Vatican of its
rights.
Nearly all the Italian newspapers
this evening print long editorials ex
pressing surprise and disappointment
at such unexpected attitude taken by
the Vatican, for it is regarded as clear
that the Observatore Romano’s state
ments are inspired and supported by
the Vatican chancery.
The question arises here, that
should the pope regain territorial sov
ereignty over his states what would
be the status of the papal subjects
over the world?
Would they hold their allegiance in
Rome, or can a citizen divide his loy
alty between two countries?
In the case of the condemned Bish
ops in Russia, the pope asked for
their release on the grounds that they
were subjects of the Vatican. What
would be his attitude toward his sub
jects should he regain raonarehial
control in the “Papal states?’*
