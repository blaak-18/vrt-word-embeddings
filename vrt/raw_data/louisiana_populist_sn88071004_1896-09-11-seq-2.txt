as part of the proceetls of the late
election steal in this parishl, also
en(deavors to expilain away the 1
drouth stlfferins , in this p:Irish, t
when replying to some exag:xera
tions of the Daily States. t
Some other correspondent of one t
of the daily papers says he is afraid t
it is a matter of politics. C
That is just what we are afraid t
of.
Wards 2, part of 3 and 5, where
the drouth has been severest in
Natchitoches, is almost entirely
Populist. The Enterprise and the
T.-D. correspondent know this,
whether they are actuated by it or
not.
Union, Lincoln, Jackson and
parts of Grant, Winn, Caldwell. 1
Ouachita anl Claiborne, where so
much suffering is reported immi
nent, are largely Populist, and this
may or may not he the secret be
hind the silly arguments advanced
against State aid.
A moments investigation of the
census will show that nearly all
these people are white, yet the
daily Times-Democrat urged a few
days ago that State aid or º'vern
ment rations made negro labor
worthless, hence ought not to be
used if possible to avoid it.
These honest, hard-working, suf
fering, but intelligent white people i
will be surprised to hear such silly
arguments when they remember
the overflow of 1 892, and the LeC- :
islature voted $30,000 before you r
could say "Jack Robinson," and i
9-tenths of it was to feed negro la
borers, if they ever got it.
Again, in 1893, the Governor
took the liberty of drawing on the
State Fiscal agent for $3O,0Oo for
the Fame purpose, and the Legisla
ture approved it in 1 94.
If those negroes hadn't gotten
those rations in 1892 and '93, they
would perhaps have gone away,
and could not have been available
to stuff ballot-boxes with, while if
these white Populists get no help
they can go away, and it will be
"joy go with them" to the Demo
crats.
Yes, it looks very much as if
politics had something to do with
it, butt i is a great shame that it
should have, and may prove re
gretful to those least expecting it.
Capt. iluale.
Capt. Jim Foster is a slick-duck
-or he thinks he is.
Not getting "Hardy Brian" to
bite at his fusion as quick as he de
sired and fearing that age would
spoil its beauty, etc,, and fearing
to risk his slickness at any time
with "Hardy Brian," who is said
to be able to sometimes see a bug
under a chip, this Capt. Jimmie
invented a QUIET meeting of his
odwn with the Pop special commit
tee of 9, with the said Hardy Bri
an left off.
He had the cold nerve to call the
Pop committee together himself,
to meet his committee at Monroe
on the 8th inst.
We got wn'md of his love letters,
to other members, however-he
didn't send us one. Oh no !i
It was a cute trick, but it didn't
work. Not more than one or two
of the Pop committee woneat; and
Capt. Jimmie had his labor for
Ihis paJa.
W are sorry for Cousin Dan,
who, under Capt, Jimmie's orders

to cliv itl. and destr)oy the lPtplulistl :
in this State 3by imlpugn inu their
mtti\'vrs, and a:louing and Ilack
miailing their leaders, etc., they are
nunited and present a solid front
for the right.
''The State convention imet and
acted, and upon the only question t
dividing it, voted by the almost t
unanimous majority of 4t; to 11,
the minority yielding gracefully as
in all democratic asssemiblaues.
Three congressional conlventions
have since been hehl and in each
the action of the State convention
w:as indorsed, one by a vote of 5s
to 25. ant. unanimously in the other
two, the two last explressing con
tidence in the ability, patriotism,
etc.. of the party management.
They are all in favor of fusion of
the right sort anl honorable, name
ly -- for Bryan and Watson.
We commend this to the Times
Democrat and others who have Ia
bored in and out of season to show
that the Pops were up in arms
against "Hardy" Brian, Gunhy and
Benort, and that half of them will i
vote the straight Democratic ticket.
W e still assure them, also Bro.
Dunn of the Demands, who is so
"afecid" that the Pops will go off
after the hanker Sewall and leave us
holding Watson's trig, that we can
count the Sewall Populists on our
lingers.
The new election law, which
goes into effect November 2, is one
o" the severe remedies to which
may be applied the old adage of
"great evils require great rlme
dies' and one which disfranchises
more voters than the proposed
amendment, as all men who are so
unfortunate as not to be able to
read and write will he deprived of
their rihts of citizenship. M!any
an old citizen of this Sta:t who has
always religiously observedthe laws
of their country, and been in read
iness to defend it with their hearts
Iood, will he denied the privi
lege of depositing their ballot in
favor of a friend or relative, of the
candidate of their choice. Men
who have toiled since their boy
hood to help develop the country
will by this atrocious law, he put
on an equality with the common
tramp that claims no home, and
with the escaped convict, or one
that served his allotted time in the
State's prison, Again since a man
who has not had the advantage of
an education is disfranceised by
the election law, and is consid
ered a non citizen or an alien, is
that man subject to military duty?
And in case of war will he be forc
ed to take up arms for the common
defense, and will he be called up
on as a juror in his parish ? Those
are qluestions in our oplinion, are
not easily answered, and it strikes
us that the new law is a very intri
cate one, and will puzzle even men
possessed of some education, as we
have said already, there are great
evils that require great remedies,
but the remedy employed by our
legislstors is one that will meet
with disapproval, by some of our
best citizens.-Rayne Tribune.
Benoet Renomeanuted.
The Populist Convention of the
5th Congressional District met in
Monroe Sept. 3rd, ton parishes be
ing represented.
After very earnest deliberations,
evincing Ipure patriotism and
much enthusiasm, the convention
renominated Hon. Alexis Benoit
for congress. This was done by
acclamation unanimously. Mr Be
noit accepted the honor in an ex
cellent speech.
Judge A. A, Gunby. against his
expressed wish and positive in
structions, was strongly urged be
fore the convention, which gave
him a maanificent ovation. In a
most dignified and eloquent ad
dress Judge Gunby requested the
withdrawal of his name, and im
preseed on the convention the wis
dom, justice and necessity of nomi
nating Mr. Benoit, who, he said,
had been twice elected to congress,
each time contesting the un
-ighteoas seating of his opponent.
Teecontests, the speaker said,
had been cmnceived and carried
through with much steadfastness
sad loyalty on the part of Mr. Be
noit, who had endured the taunts
p and privationa incident to them,

Third. That we heartily in

Fourth. That we favor an alli

patriotism of the properly ('onsti

Fifth. That we indorse free
speech and honest elections as the
cardinal principles of free govern

Sixth, That we most earnestly in
dorse the heroic and patriotic course
of the lion. A. Benoit, in his brave
and stubborn contest for the rights
of the Populists of this district,
who have twice elected him to Con
gress.
Seventh, That we inorse the
anti-option bill as essential to the
rights of the producing classes of
this district.
Eighth, That we denounce the
corrupt cotton tie and bagging
trust, which has combined for the
Spurpose of robbing the cotton pro
ducers, and we recommend that a
substitute for the steel cut tie be
f used by the farmers.
Ninth, That we denounce the is
suance and use as money of clear
ing house certificates in New York
as illegal paper and bills of credit,
and we call upon the Secretary of
-the Treasury to suppr to suppress them, as
he has been very active in suppres
sing similar issues by States and
farmers' organizations.
C Tenth, That we express onr
e deepest sympathy with the suffer
s ers of the drouth-stricken region
of Louisiana, and we declare that
the extent of this suffering has not
been exaggerated. We earnestly
e call upon the police juries to aid
t the people by establishing public
Sworks. We appeal to the towns
rand to all charitable persons and
bodies, and especially the Farmers'
SAlliance of the Western States,
r which have been blessed with good
crops, to extend aid to our afflicted
and distressed fellow-citizens. We
recommend that the Governor im
mediately call the Legislature in
extra session, in ordoer that legal
0 and constitutional steps may be ta
n ken to relieve the victims of this
unparalleled drouth.

This funny and instructive look
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It,
It contains 176 pages of laugh- e
provoking matter, and 40 full-page gsA
illustrations of Cleveland as a riv
tramp.
