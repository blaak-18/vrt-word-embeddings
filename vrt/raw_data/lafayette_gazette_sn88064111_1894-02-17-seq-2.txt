Good loads have more effect toward

any other one enterprise, and they

THE CHANCES FOR SU.GAR
It is a pretty difficult matter to say
how sugar w ill fare in the Senate.
One day dipatches from Washington
are very encouraging to those inter-.
ested in this industry and the next
day the wires bring a contradiction
of these reports. What wi:l be the
outcome no one can tell. Our
Senators are making a brave fight
and insist upon a reasonable duty;
Sif they fail to obtain this, they have
announced their intention to vote
against Wilson bill. We give below
the Picayune's Washington corre
spondence of February 13: "The
press reports sent out to-night con
cerning sugar are unfavorabie, bUt
with the exception of the inaction of i
the senate sub-committee on the i
subject of the sugar duty, nothing
has occurred to change the situa- '
tion for the worse. The committee
members are very reticent, even t
with the other senators, and nobody I
seems to know exactly what they are
doing with the tariff bill. Most of
the statements in the newspapers as
to the sub-committee's proceedings a
are conjecturalin their n`atiure. The t
Louisiana senators had not heard
any unfavorable news to-day. As j
far as can be learned the committee a
have no. come to a decision on the
sugar question. ..

The value of schools to a com
munity can not be overestimated.
They raise the standard of intel
ligence and are tl.esturdy foes of ig
norance. They elevate the standard
of morality and decrease crime.
They -reform and civilize. They
develop the spiritual and intellectual
part of man, they form a iig::er
society to which culture is the open
sesame and thus rouse the commu
nity as a whole to a nobler apprecia
tion of life. They widen the field
of amusement by creating an inter
est in standard and interesting books.
They bring the com munity in touch
with the world by elevating it to
tastes in common with the best part
of the world. Tney draw from their
neighboring communities by offeridg
a healthful atmosphere to their
children. They increase the impor
tance of the town or parish by giving
it a name for culture abroad. They
broaden the mind, and make the
community liberal and progressive.
They are the promoters of progress
and advancement and disseminate
those principles. In short, they re
present a high plain of morality, cul
ture and refinement, and gre the
test of a community's status.

It is always a pleasure for the Star
to make mention of any new business
that is opened up in our little city.
Therefore we take this opportunity
to announce the arrival of Mr.
Locke Neveu, of Lafayette, in the
Queen city. He has rented the
Burleigh building and has opened up
a grocery store, and is now ready to
sell to the public, at prices that will
astonish the people of this com
munity. We visited his establish
ment Wednesday and looked over
his goods and we feel quite safe in
saying that he has as complete a line
of fancy and staple groceries as there
is in this town. Mr. Neveu is a
brother-in-law of Engineer Coffee,
of the I. & V. Railroad, and comes
well recommended from his former
home, Lafayette.-Abeville Star.
