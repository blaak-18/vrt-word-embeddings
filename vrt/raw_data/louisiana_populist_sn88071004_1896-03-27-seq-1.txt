Mr. Bditor:-I beg to invite the at
tention of your readers to the differ
ence in the price of commodities, and
the amount of money in circulation in
1866 and in 1895. In .order to do this,
and demonstrate it so plainly that no
one can gainsay, I take two tables of
transactions occurring respectively In
1886 and In 1896. ftrcp the "Little
Statesman," pages 85 and 86. First I
give you the bill of goods bought by a
farmer who took a bale of cotton to
to'Ic i 186, welghfag M80 peounb,
which be sold at 42 cents per pound,
bringing 210 dollars. After selling the
bale oteotton he bought the following

R. Q. Mills now knows "where he is
at." But what does he care? He has
Ailled his ooffers.
Let the Populists of Texas continue
an inetitutionary campaign, and push
the work of organization.
Just keep cool, brethren, and all will
be well. Turn your gun on the enemy
and keep them pointed that way.
lt all Popilislt so act that they
can truthfully say with Shakespeare,
"No man hath any quarrel to me."
The tariff question seems to be on
the shett, and the average Republican
Sleder is at sa without a compass.
We must have a fair count in Texas
this fall. Let the Populists organize at
every box pd swear that it shall be so.

whole Sfaagi~a question becomes plain
4o him.
Asq whe*adrl steal another's vote

traitor, and scouidrel and should be
dLsranied.
There are entirely too many politi
eisa ia the old parties that are on the
arvenu order; tQo ply small brain,
smooth bores.
I Ifmoney was plentiful there would
be no idle people, less crime, more
happLsMes, no want and we would
have a better people.
Let every man who is opposed to
mono~oly enlist under the People's
party banner and swear that Right and
Justice shall again rule.
The "good" times has caused the
State Bank of Blooumfeld, Neb., to
close its doors. The old party poli
eles is doing the work.
The Demooratic and Republican
leaders seem to be intoxicated, actually
drunk on power. Thay'll have time to
sober up after November.
It now seems certaln that Major Je
a e C. Kearby of Dallas will be the
People'sa. party nominee for governor:
and, if so, he will be elected.

Capitol grounds In
striking black let

cently been paint
ed upon its cream
colored walls that
tells the passersby:
"This house was
built by General
George Washington in 1775." The
building has long been occupied, and
is now used, as a fashionable board
ing house; and its exterior and Interior
have not been changed except by re
pairers from time to time since it was
occupied by General Washington.
With the exception of the old Van
Nesse cottage, on the Potomac banks,
southeast of the White House, nearly
all of the oldest residences in the na
tional capital are to be found on Capi
tol Hill. Many of these buildings have
recently been restored and furnished

distsans eo the Capitol and of the great
sew Congreslonal ibrsry.
But tow of the United States senators,
however, live In that vicinity. Senator
arham G. Harris, of Tennessee; Senator
Turpeiq of Indiana, and Senator Mitchell
of Wlsconsin, are the exceptions and
they reside in houses which for modern
eleenas wl almeost bear eemparison
with an in Washington. The faiorite
location with the senators seems to be
In had around Thomas'Cirele. One en
tire. row of magnleent ~auses here is
ocupted by United States senators and
their families; in fact, the equare is
often spoken of as "Senators' Row."
mealtr Morrill, of Vermelt, who is
tnjewlag his forty*nrst winter in Wash

row of stately homes. A manificent

warmest peral friends was the ar
chitect who designed the Capitol. and
a ie steel engraving of the famous

Among the Congressional families
who reside on Capitol tiIll is that of
Obars W. Stone, of Twenty-seventh
Pennsylvania distrct. Mrs. Steae is
e of the most attractive ladles of the
Cosgwros al oloony. As the wife of

more, for some time, and is the fortu
nate possessor of a voice of singular
sweetness, that is well trained both in
vocal music and elocution. The latter
is her favorite study and is a source of
rare enjoyment to her friends. Miss
Stone is one of the few young ladies
who can attempt Watteau effects. She
can wear miniatures, aigrettes, delicate
lace and forget-me-not silks.
The Charity Ball of 1596 has passed
into history a delightful memory, er
pecially so, perhaps. because of the
presence of Mrs. Cleveland, accompan
ied by the President. The proceeds from
this successful and brilliant function
will be devoted to the Children's Hos
pital. This is the most worthy charity
in Washington. The ladies who have
charge of it are all well known and
are of the highest social prominence.
One often sees affecting as well as novel
sights at the hospital where the chil
dren of the rich frequently go and play,
and bend over the bedside of the little
patients to entertain them. The con
trast of rosy cheeks wi:h the pale and
pinch"d ones in the different wards is
just as it always is In story books.
Tucked away in their tiny white beds
these frail little patients seem to enjoy
the comforts provided for them.
In the colored ward, the little ones
sing to the visitors quaint camp meet
ing songs which are very entertaiuing
The babies' ward always proves the
center of attraction. The youngest one
there now is a tiny stranger only a
few weeks old. Since this department
was established, only a few months
ago, over one hundred babies have been
cared fot.
Washington society Is as notable for
the number of clever, handsome and
beautiful matrons this winter, as it is
rich in its array of rosebuds and belles.
Among these clever matrons, who, with
the scholars, statesmen and diplomats,
make up the cosmopolitan society of
Washington, may be mentioned many
Pennsylvania ladies born and bred in
the Keystone state. Mrs. Scott Town
send, Madame Romero, Madame Pate
notre, Mrs. Dr. Gusman, Mrs. Senator
Quay, Mrs. Jack Robinson, Mrs. liar
rlet Lane Johnson. Mrs. Justice Peck
ham are a few of the distinguished
matrons from Pennsylvania who pre
side over beautifully-appointed estab
lishments and by their entertainments
add much grace to the social life at
the capital.
Society girls who skate well are es
pecially numerous and their chic winter
costumes worn with little sealskin or
velvet toques are very becoming. The
young ladles carry their skates in skate
bags, and some very attractive and
quaint one seen this week have been
patterned after the old-fashioned reti
cules. The skating parties enjoy the
morning best and nearly always these
fair skatems of society take home a
number of friends for little Informal
lunch parties.
The members of the Russian legation
are all good skaters, but it remains
for the minister from Denmark, Mr.
Constantin Brun, to carry off the hen
ors He is as expert and as graceal
as any professional in his mastery of
the shlalg stooeels, yet itf there is one
thing more than another he dislike
it is to seem to "show off," consequent
ly his enjoyment of the cross-roll bekk
wardsand eutting monograms and fan
cy figures s somewhat aurred beca se
every one enjoys watching his graes
and skill.
The British ambassador, Sir Julian
Pauneefote, is devoted to golf, but does
not skate. His three daughters, how
ever, are very graceful and expert
skaters. Miss Sybil Pauneefote is no

Light in India.
Light is to be thrown at last on the
religion of India. The great shrine at
Siva has been lighted with electricity,
and now the other temples will soon
be so arranged that by pressing a but
ton they can instantly be flooded with
light like a modern hotel. There are
some three million gods in the Hindu
Pantheon, and they will now witness
a miracle surpassing any ever at
tributed to them. Heathenism will
have to go before the electric light.
There can be no more miracles
wrought in dark corners to deceive the
ignorant. Turn on the light and they
will see that it is murder to burn
women on the funeral pyre, and no re
ligion to torture child widows because
their baby husbands died. True re
ligion thrives best where men see
clearest, and the Brush light in the
temples of India will brush away the
old superstitions and false beliefs in
false gods. The world moves. The
Moses that was there when the light
want out is there to-day with an elec
tric plant.
The laborer may be worthy of his
hire, but he does not always get it.
In California the growing of olive
trees from small cuttings was first
suggested by a poor nurseryman. It
was worth millions of dollars to Cali
fornia and the southwest, but the poor
discoverer got nothing from it. 'Before
that time olive trees for orchard plant
ing purpo-es used to cost $7 and $8
each. They can now be had by the
thousands for 10c and 15c each. A
poor Pomona nurseryman found, by
experimenting, that olive trees could
be propagated from cuttings by start
ing them in the winter months in
boxes of sand in hot greenhouses.
That discovery has been worth millions
of dollars to California and the south
west, but the discoverer is still work
ing in a Pomona nursery for $1.50 a
day. The cuttings that come by the
hundreds from a full fsized tree are
about the size of toothpicks.
Lowejl's Old Home.
There is considerable concern in
Boston about the future of James Rus
sell Lowell's magnificent old home in
Cambridge. at the gateway of Mount
Auburn cemetery. The house is the
property of the poet's daughter, but
the land adjoining it is in the hands
of real estate agents, and the fine
estate will soon be cut up into build
ing lots unless the property is secured.
The house is an old Tory mansion, one
of the few still standing in excellent
condition in Cambridge, and it is an
object of great and increasing interest
to thousands of visitors from all over
the country. It would make a most
desirable museum.
Some Social Customs.
Don't let us say that we wouldn't
trust our daughters and our sons say
where, let us keep our faith whole and
unbounded in them, but do let us re
vise our ideas a little as to what is
right and proper in our social customs.
If our social customs were not so lax;
if young girls were not left alone with
young men so often and for so long a
time, there would be few daughters of
respectable homes go astray. Mothers
cannot longer close their eyes to this
question; the souls of their daughters
are in their hands., and they owe it to
themselves, to their daughters, and to
society to throw every possible protec
tion around them.--Womankind.
A Fearfal Weapea.
Eugene Paul Brand has just submit
ted a fearful weapon to the German
minister of war. It puts all inventiomn
in the sphere of death-dealing luetru
ments in the shade. The Brand oon
trivance is a gun not loaded with pow
der, but with compressed gas. A sin
gle charge will asulke for 2500 shots,
and volleys of fifty shots each can be
fired in rapid succession. This Brand
new invention is one of the numerous
and improved methods of killing peo
ple that advaneed civilization is now
demandixg. His activity in destroying
human lives will doubtless win for him
a monuwment.

about about poor crops from our

we expect every seed we put in 11w

Counting Noses.
The International Statistical I nst i
tute asks that a simultaneous c.n:.
be taken of all the world in 1jUO0. This
can be done if slight modifications in
the time of taking their regular cen
sus be made by the most important
countries. Portugal, Denmark, the,
United States, German', Autriai.
Switzerland, Belgium, Hlungary and
Sweden will regularly take their c .n
sus in 1900, and other countries milrght
easily arrange to do so. 'his plain,
however, will hardly be agreed to by
Noew York and Chicago. It woul:l
give them no time to incorporat,:
another village and make a greater
