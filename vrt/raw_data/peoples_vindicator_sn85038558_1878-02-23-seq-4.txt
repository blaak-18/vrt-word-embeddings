Thomlas A. Hendricks. ado
New York, Feb. 2.-Thomas A. Iu(
Ilhendricks has tehlegraphled the I0r-- iit
aild a reply to August Bleliont's let
ter, published in thlie e same jurnal
Jar. 30, Mr. Ilendricks says: Is
The purpose of his (hIelonlt's) let- nat
ter was to show that the views at- r
tributed to fme on the silvel' question iil
arle inconsistent t tilli opilii lns here- a
tolore expressed, and tle-refore it ean pu
not be correlly repoIrttd. The I-. pl
port in the ('ineinnat i (Conn'mel ia il
was correct. I very much desire io tl
be considered consistent, but I woull ill
rather be certain I am right than va
consistent npon this question, I think th
I have been consistent. MIr. lel ca
mont quotes nie as holdiing that since gr
the act of March I4, 1N89, the blnd- ag
ed debt Wmust he paid in gold, as con
tradistinguished from iiaper or 0 ilver.
Iii that lie is not correct. The bill to
stengtlen the people's credit was
pending in the Senate in February,
18J9. I made an arglnimsent against
the section which pledged the faith 1
of the Government to the paiymient
of the bonds in coin. I opposed it ha
because I thought that the contract 11l
allowed the paI3 ment of the plrinci
pal of the five-twenty bonds to be 11
made in Treasury 1notds.
Mr. lBelniont takes one sentelnce to 0
show that I held that the effect of the tf
measure would be to pay in gold. li;
had Mr. Belhnont read more careful- si
ly lie would have seen that I read et
the section containing these words: ti'
"That the faith of the United States t
is solemnly pledged to the payment tl
in coin or its equivalent," and that I a1
then said: "It will cause the removal tl
of doubts, and make the law to read ti
that the debt shall be paid in coin. ti
That is the effect of this section." Ir
Upon that construction I made my tl
argument against the section, not as
in controversy whether paylent t
should be in silver as against gold,
but whether it might be in paper as
against coin. It was not qlestioned I,
in that debate that silver was coin, o
and that the debt would be payable h
in silver, whether that section passed "
or did not pass. The section, sub- t
stantially as I read it in the Senate,
became law uineteen days afterwards. t
Its force and effect did not become a
question of political controversy in I
Indiana in 1872, but it did enter into b
the discussion of 1874. lii the Dem- h
ocratic Convention of that year a a
resolution was passed declaring the
5-20 bonds payable in greenbacks. I
presided over that convention, and as
I could not give that resolution my n
support I took occassion at the first t
public meeting thlich' I addressed in I
Indianapolis to say so, and to give .1
my reasons. I thought then, as I '1
believe now, that after the faith of
the nation was pledged to payment
in coin, we could not, pay in Treasu.
ry notes; that putchesers of bonds
after that date took them relying up
on that pledge, and that we are t
bound by it. That was my argument
before the people. Neither my hear- c
ers nor I thought of the question e
whether payment could be'iuade in
silver. It was not then doubted. It
was not then known to myself, and I
suppose not to one of the audience,
that the silver dollar had been dis
carded.
Mr. Belmont refers to that address,
and to the use of thie word "gold" in t
it, instead of the word "coin," as
committing me to the payment of the
debt in gold, and not in silver. The
only question then discussed was the
right to pay in greenbacks. The
righllt to pay in silver was not then
questioned or considered in Indiana.
In the addiess which I made as Presi
dent of the convention, two months
before, my opinions upon the cur
rency were somnewlhat fully express
ed. I then said: "\Ve can not too
strongly express the importance of
the policy that shall restore uniforlii
ty of value to all the money of the
country, so that it shall be always
and readily converted. That gold
and silver are the real standird of
value, is a cherished Democratic sen
timent, not niow nor hereafter to be
abandoned." I certainly could not
have used that language in the cani
paign of 1874, and know that silver
was no longer money.
A more important question made
by Mr. Belmont is that the argumnent
which excludes the payment of the
public debt in treasury notes under
thie act of March, 18i69, applies with a
greater force under the act of 1873,
which excludes the silver dollar from
the coinage. I think that is not cor
rect. The act of 1869 was to remove
any doubt, to settle the conflicting
interpretations of tihe laws under
which the public obligations were
contracted, and to pledge the faith of
the United States to the payment of
such obligation in coin. After full
consideration, it became law. It was
soon followed by the act to authorize
the refunding of the national debt.
That law provided that $1,500,000,000
of bonds, vwhichi it authorized, should
be redeemniable in coin of the present
standard value. Because thie act of
1869 was a solemn piledge of my coun.
try, made by competent authority,
I felt that it was binding, so bind
ing, indeed, that it could only be re
pealed to the prejudice of those to
whom it was given.
Why and wherein is the coinage
act of 1873 nmore sacred and irrepeala
ble than the coinage act of 1834,
which it modified I Does the power
to coin nioney and regulate'the val
ne thereof belong to thie class of
powers that, once exercised, became
exhausted? If that were so, the
power had been exhlaustetd before
the.passage of the act of 1873 Or
is itthe right of the public or private
creditor either to say to Congress,
"You shall not exercise the constitu
tional power of coining money and
regulating the value thereof, because
by changing the standard you may
change the value of investment T"
We have not recognized such a rule.
There would be force in such a clause
under the act of 1870, which provides
for the payment of bonds in coin of
the present standard value.
The act of 1878 contains no pledge
nor contract. It is legislation under
the contionuing power of Congress,
and subject to repeal or amendment,
like any other law passed under the
same power. It is not, therefore, in
my judgment a question of public
faith, but one of expediency only.
Being such, it seems to me the part
of wisdom to have some regard to the
condition of flinaacil distress that*
exisets in the country, and to the dis
turbed state of the public mind that
pervades a large portiou of the coun
,iy. Any change in the coinagte i
always adelictac and important work,
and should be made only after the
most careful consideration of all the L
interests of the country.
honiuhd silver mloney he resltored
I have thought so. The pled'lge ofI
1I 19 of payment in coin, and the L
assurance in the act of 1870 of pay- a
nuent in coin at the then standard
valve, woulld sent to authiolize, al
lost to rqu lire it. Coi pliance withl
at contlacet can not ble a bre:ach oft L
puriblic faith. O country is a lar ge in
produ(cer of silver. The quality tofl
money is important to its value. I
think that Uw hen restored, silver will at
apprclh anl perhapl s reach gold ill ra
value. But should experience Iprove
that it iimust remain n helow gold, Ie
cause of its greater lrodluctioln, Con
gress has amplll po.wers to Irovide
against any evils likely to follow.

Dear Vindicator :al
Since writing you last week, nothing

The case of our State, the l)emocratic, r

D Jefferson's first telrm of the Presidency. -
I The Federal party had during the Admin- t

t idly approaching dissolution, an,[ in or

Selecting Mr. Jefierson and a Republican
t Congress, but the war did not end with
the eleetion, for on the meeting of the
Republican Congress the work of reform
was begun in earnest nor was it suspen

nest of patronage. Not so however in
our case, our party leaders seem to wish
u toenjoy some of the fruits of Radical
villainy.' Yours truly,
