OUR WAHINGTON LET=.R.
WASHINGTON D. C., July 20 1878.
Yesterday the examination of Sen
ator Kellogg was began by the Potter t,
Committee. His replies were ex- n
treamely cautious and, judging from a
them and his manner, he has a fund h
of information back which will prove 14
of value if it can be reached. Gen- 14
eral Butler's questions so far, have
been asked so as to make promiebt
the fact that Packard, the Republi- a
can candidate for Governor, received e
more votes than the Hayes's electors s
did. He also produces a pamphlet ii
prepared by "stalwart" Republicans t
of Louisiana, which attempt to smug.
gle in two Hayes electors who, after
the protests were exhausted, were
found to be defeated. By the very t
skillful plan arranged by the Return- I
ing Board and the "visiting states, i
men," it was not necessary that any
Republican candidate should have re- -
ceived any particular number of votes, '
Ten were as good as ten thousand,
for there was absolutely no limit to
the capacity of the Board to throw
out Democratic votes. From Kellogg
to Eliza Pinkston there does not seem
to have been a Republican leader in e
Louisiana who was above the most 1
unblushing frauds.
Mr. Hayes has now for the second
time, moved on the works of Senator
Conkling, Collector Arthur and Na
val officer Comell, of the New York
Custom- House. Secretary jhermian
was in New York when the ehanges
were announced, and was doubtless
there as the agent of Mr. Hayes. It 8
remains to be seen what effect the i
removals will have on Mr. Conkling'.
Senatorial ambition. No doubt they
were intended to injure him. It will
be remembered that when the same
changes were attempted daring the º
last session of Congress the Senate, e
at the urgent solicitation of Senator
Conkling, refused to assent to theiq
by confirming the men nominated to
succeed Conkling's friends.- in all
Democrotic State conventions so far
held excellent sense has been shown
in the construction of platforms: and
good nominations have been made. I
The following extract from the Mich. I
igan platform is as forcible as it is
true. We arraign the Repnulicao
party for its corruption iLaoffie;,tts
unwise legislation and its wicked per
version of the people's, wi il s ex
pressed at the polls. Itlias sl rnI
ered the public funds Mid laud arid
has corrupted the body politic; it
has placed men in office who are dis'
and incapable, and have used
1,ositions as private perquisites ;
slegislated for the rich and op.
e .sed the poor, and has burdened
each town and city with debt islid
taxation, driven our commerce from
the sea, and destroyed our once pow.
erful navy, and completed its career
of crime and dishonor by stealing the
Presidency from the people, and
placing a fraud in the Presidential
chair."
Apropos of our present critical re
lations with Mexico, the chhrhiteris
tic trick by which she sought to evade
the awards of the Mexican Mixed
Commission, is rather interesting,
They aggregated above 4#M000 ,00, as
due to American citizens. ThougL
solemnly pledged to accept the Com
mission's decisions as finali Deaz's
agent incubated a plan which, had it
been successful, would have operated
to render the six year's work .pf the
Commission a nollity to a very large
extent. It contemplated the passage
of a joint resolution, prohibiting the
Treasury from paying out to twq
claimapts-Weil and the La Abra
mining Company-the money Mexico
bad deposited there subject to their
order agreeably to the Commission's
decsion, pending the investigstiop of
a tramped up charge of fraud. They
were test eases and on their fate de
pendedmany similar awards. In an!
American Cotgress were founda men
willing to abet this elieme to defaud
their own countrymel, 4emiugly.
The resolution passed the Senate and
went to the House fot its concurrence:

Mark Twain tells the following story,
related by a lilow-passenger, who, bain

an old Queen Annl's mlusket for his
father once; whereupon he gave the fid
lowing:
You see, the old man was trying to
learn ume to shoot blackbirds and beats
4has tore up, the .young coru. and such
things, so that I 'could be of soito dse
about the farm, because I wasn't big
enough to do much. My gun was a
single barreled shotgun, and the old
man carried an old Queen Ann musket
that weighed a ton, made a report like a
thunder clap, and kicked like a mule.
The old man wanted me to shoot the old 0
musket s ,I, eo ligy; Ij 'as afraid.
One day, tlsatt.i- own g skand
took her tt red mn, and asked
him to load her up, because it was out
in the field. Hiram saidl:
"Do you see those marks on the stock
-an X and a V, on each side of the
queen's crown Well, that means ten
balls and five sligi-g,-that's her load." M
"But how umuch powder ?" t
'Oh," he says, "it don't matter; put
in three or four handfuls." D
So I loaded her up that way, and it
was an awful charge-I had sense
enough to see that-and started out. I
leveled her on a good many blackbirds,
but I g ttO p1U e l. trigger

"Yes, sir," says I.
"What did you kill?'"
"Didn't kill anything, sir-didn't
shoot her off, was afraid she'd kick-I
knew blamed well she would."
"Gemme that gun !" the old man said,
as mad as sin.
And he took aim at a sappliug on the
other side of the road, and I began to
drop back out of danger, and the next t(
moment I heard the earthquake and
saw the Queen Anne whirling end over
end in the air and the old man spinning b+
