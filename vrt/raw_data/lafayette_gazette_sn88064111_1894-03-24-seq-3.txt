fire before any serious damage was
done.
It is indeed vefy strange that
other towns with all the modern
systiams of fire protechion fall victims
to disastrous fires while Lafayette
seems to be free from all such con
flagrations. Let us be thankful to
providence for our extraordinary
good luck, but to rely forever on
that kind providence which has pro
tected us in the pas is tiithing else
but criminal negligence. We dare
say that there is hot anywhere a
town that has done less than Lafay- I
ette to procure the necessary means
to fight the destructive element. if
we can not do better, let us raise,
by private subscription, a sum iidffi
cientily large to buy a hand pump I
mind an adequate quantity of hose.
And we believe it will be within the
power of the City Council to com
pel every property-owner to have
One or two wells dug on his place. I
From this source enough water can
be had to extiilguish an ordinary
fire if taken in time.
The Gazette would like to see
some public spirited citizen make the I
initiatory move in this matter. Who 4
will it be ?
Attetiipt a. Train Wrecking.
An attempt was made to wreck 1
the train near Cade statidn in the I
night of Saturday last. Crossties 3
had been placed on the rails about :
half a mile on the east side of Cade, I
and had the engineer failed to stop 1
his engine, it would, in all proba- I
bility, resulted in a serious accident. i
As customary on such occslotik the 1
officials of the train telegraphed <
what had happened to Superinten- I
dent Owens, who telegraphed the<
railroad officials here instructing ,
them to inform Sheriff Broussard of <
the facts of the case and to take 1
him fd Cade bif the first east-bound I
train. Although the sheriff was at I
home sleeping, he readily consented I
to go outside of his parish and do t
all in his power to capture the s
would-be train wreckers. He i
boarded the freight train which left <
here at about 3:3o in the morning I
and stopped at Broussard where he l
was joined by Deputy Billeaud. i
At this station he wired Sheriff Cade 1
of Iberia to meet him at Cade.
Cade station was reached at 4 1
o'clock and the sheriff and his
deputy went to work immediately.
They were informed that Joseph
Samuels, a negro gambler, was seen
loitering around the station during
the day and until about t o'clock in
the morning and surmising that he
was iniplicated in the attempted
wreck, the officers soon located him
at his home, one mile from Cade
and arrested him. Among other in
cidents which lead the officers to
believe that Samuels is the right man
they found in his room a coat iith
the sleeves nearly co-ered with mud.
Samuels claims to have arrived
home at io o'clock but persons at
Cade say thdt he left that place after 1
midnight.
In the mea'ntime Sheriff Cade and
Deputy Romero arrived and lthe
prisoner was turned over to them.
If Samuels proves to be the cul
prit this arrest will be another feather I
in Ike's cap.

[Communicated.
Last week being court time, and
not having v'ery much to do on my
plantatidn, I thought I would take a
tittle flying trip down to the capital
of our parish, Lafayette, which is
surrounded by one of the most lovely
farming countries to be found in the
state of Louisiana, and I doubt vary
much if it can be surpassed by atiy
state in the union. Lafayette, the
parish seat fith all its natural beau
ties and railroad facilities cannot be
surpassed. As we approached the
courthouse, we stopped and looked
at the old rookery of a fence stir
rounding it, then, at the old rotten
loose planks, half toMi up, once
called a side walk. We were com
pelled to say, with other parties,
that they 'i~ee a disgrace to our
parish. We were glad to hear that
the Police Jury are preparing to
move in the matter and put our
courthouse and grounds in a res
pectable shape and form, that will
be a credit to the parish. We did
not larn whether the Police Jury
intended to enclose the grounds
with a wall, iron fence, post and
chains, or throw it open, set out
shade trees and iiiaii a little park
of it. We much prefer the fIiter,
as it will save some four or five hun
dred dollars expense to the parish,
besides being more modern, fashion
able and convenient. The extra ex
pense of building an iron fence,
would level up the grounds, set out
the shade trees; build the brick (or
some more substantial metal) side
walk (which was to be build in either
case) and give our courthouse one
good coat of paint, which is neces
sary for the preservation of the build
ing, as well as for its looks: I
believe the people would be delighted
with the change, and say, "Long
life to our Police Jury."

A Boy Mourns for his Dead
Friend.

March 19, 1to94.
The painful iie~si of the death,
Saturday evening, of our dear little
friend and schoolmate, Jimnmy
Calder,has been a great shock to us.
Fresh yet in our menmory i~ the re
collection of the liveliness and ino
cence of our departed little friend,
but assured that the good Shepherd,
who careth for his flock has taken
the gentle lamb into his own fold.
Yes, our little friend you have gone,
to Histi, who said. "Suffer little
childfen jo come unto m'e.' We
kfio* not how soon our hour may
come. Oh I that we may all meet
you in that happier world is our
wish. Good-bye, little friend.

Prendergast on Spring Poets.
Prendergast, Mayor Harrison's
assassin, may be crazy, but he has
sense enough to know thai even a
man under stutence of death, has
rights which should not be infringed
upon. Prendergast has a cellmate,
name Rdafferty, who loves to write I
poetry a!d since th6 approach of
spring his poetical effusions are of
daily occurteuce; This, Ptender
gast did not interfere with, and the
poet might be writing spring poems
yet, had he not attempted to read
his composition to his' companion.
Prendergast would not stand this
and proceeded to show his disap
proval in a very forcible manner.
He landed his right fiht against the
spring poe's jtw and' Was pounding
the life out of him then the jail
guards rushed in just lit time to save
his life. In spite of what physi
cians may say few people will now
belive thkt Prendergast is insane.
At any rate he knows that when a
man is attacked he haoa right to de
fend himself. He has also fully
demonstrated his ability as a judge
of literature. It is to be regretted
that instead of going into politics,
which is the cause of his misfortune,
Prendergast did not turn his at
tention toward the suppiression of
sprinig poets ;
Should the seignorage bill become

about on% hundretw oIOple piesently

Death of a Good Man.
r Antoine Guidry died at 3:4o0 a: m.
Wednediay, March az, at his home
near Coulee Isle des Cannes, and
w~as buried Thursday morning isn
the Catholic cemetery, in this town.
Mr. Guidry was born And reared in
this parish where he died at the ag$
of 49 years, surrounded by a de
voted wife and affectionate children.
He was an enterprising and pro
gressive citizen and a man of ster
ling worth and unquestioned integ
rity. Of general anid happy dis
position, he made friends where
ever hib went, and was a favorite
with the people. He was a plantec
aild .tictessful business mhan. In
politics, he was a Democrat of the
old school, and although ~irving in
the private ranks, he was a zealous
worker fdr the success of his
party; and, by ford and deed, al
ways urged his people on in the
the cats e of his country. Distinc
tion or prominence he sever sought,
but was ever sincere and true ini the
fulfillment of the duties of life as
bc$nime the character of an unpre
tentious, but faithiitl citizen. Such
are the true patriots who tear the
brunt of cibil contention, and win
for others the laurels that round
their temples with honor and fame;
His funeral was attended by i
large concourse of friends and rel
atives. He was laid to rest in the
old catholic cemetery, where most
of his forefathers sleep. Men df
the old type, who though, unknown
to the annals of their country, have
left the impress of their virtues
on the traditions of their children.
One by one,they are passing away to
that country from whose bourn no
traveler returns. May their virtues
be remembered by those who come
after them and be an incentive to
true and honorable lives.
Mr. Guidry leaves a widow and
seven daughters to mourn his loss.
Our tenderest sympathies are ex
tended to them in their sotrdW and
affliction.
The young man Ben Saintes, who
killed James Gill in a saloon at New
Iberia a few months kgo was con
victed last week of Mittirder, without
capital punishment.
