THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE,
AND A FEW LACONICS
THE CHOICE OF A WOMANLY
WOMAN.
It isn’t often one hears of a busi
ness woman who gives up a lucrative
position to accept one where the
work is harder, the responsibilities
heavier and the pay smaller, but that
is what Miss Lily Price has done.
Miss Price has been connected
with the United Press Association
for many years. She has handled
big enterprises, and her reason for
giving up her position with the As
sociation, to become matron of an
orphan asylum, is explaind thus, by
herself;
“I think my training in the news
paper business was exactly what I
needed to fit me for this new work
among the children. I think I know
now what kind of men and women
the business world needs and I feel
confident of my ability to teach these
little ones the things that are most
needed to make them good citizens.
I say this only as a tribute to the
school I am leaving—the business
department of a news organization.
“Yes, the newspaper field offers
big opportunities to women. I think
women will more and more find big
work in the newspaper business. But,
after all, there is other work that be
longs more directly and intimately
to women. Think of what it is to
handle five hundred little orphan
children! Isn’t it a big field? Why,
that is better than handling the
finances of a big corporation!”
Isn’t that a splendid argument,
from a splendid woman?
And doesn’t it knock into a cocked
hat all the piffle we read about wo
man being less womanly, and more
sordid, and less inclined to cope with
the problems of child training and
education?
There are many business women
who would have gladly done just as
Miss Price has done. Who would
give up all and any enterprises in
the business world to cope with and
guide those little orphans, who have
been bereft of the care and training
of their natural guardians.
And what a fortunate institution
the Jewish Orphan Asylum of Cleve
land is to have a woman at the head
of its affairs who knows what the
world needs in the shape of men and
women, and who lays aside money
making to give those little ones the
benefit of her knowledge and train
ing.
And if woman’s entry in the busi
ness world and bread winning ranks
has made it possible for women of
this sort to evolve, isn’t it well that
it is so?
We have had so much theoretical
goodness on the part of so many, we
have listened to such dreary preach
ments of the duty of woman, it’s re
freshing to be able to chronicle this,
story of the woman who did, and
who gives such sound, excellent rea
sons for doing.
To the man and woman with the
memory of a happy childhood —tO'
those of us who can think of a home
with a loving mother and an indul
gent father, what can be more pitiful
than the thought of the asylum rais
ed child, deprived of these memories
when it has reached man or woman
hood?
And that Miss Price will be as
successful in her self-chosen task of
mothering these motherless little
ones, no one can doubt.
And that the little children will
benefit immeasurably from the min
istrations of such a woman, there
can also be no doubt.
The business world will have gain
ed in ratio to the number of children
who will come under Miss Price’s
guidance and care.

HAVE THE FUN OF FISHING WITH
YOUR HOOK AND LINE ANt>
ALSO BRING HOME A NICE
STRING OF FISH.
When you you go fishing it would
be well to have a Eureka Fish Net in
the stream, and when your patience
is threadbare, go to the net and get
your mess of fish, you have the pleas
ure of fishing and also take home the
fish to show “that the big one didn’t
get away”.
They catch all the different varie
ties of fish that inhabit our rivers,
creeks and ponds, the fish go into
them at times until they are in a
perfect jam, they will soon clear a
stream of the musk rat, many buy
them for the purpose of catching
house and musk rats.
They only require being baited
with a few pieces of corn bread and
dropped into the water, they are ea
sily handled, only weighing three or
four pounds, and can be used by any
one with common sense.
It is the ideal way for the man
who hasn’t the time to fish the or
dinary way, as it doesn’t require the
time or attention of ordinary tackle.
He can attend to them when it suits
to leave his business.
Full printed directions are sent
with each net for the benefit of per
sons who have had no experience in
this way of fishing. They tell where
to fish for certain kinds of fish, etc.,
and the nets can be used with or
without a boat, and thousands o-f
men, women and children are using
them. See their advertisement on
page 16 and write them for book of
prices and testimonials.
