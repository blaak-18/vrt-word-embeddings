The. Big':t Man In the Right
Place.
Feb. 7th. 1SMA .
Editor Populist :--On the 29th G
ult. Senator B. R. Tilman, for two
hours held the vast assembly of in- am
telligent men and refined women, drc
that were present in the Senate Co
chamber and crowded the galle- iS
ries, spell-bound by the force of for
his wonderful magnetic power. rea
No one interrupted him. He fin
ished and was a great man. Lad of
Chrinst come to Congress he could pat
not have denounced in more ap
propriate and befitting language be
and in a more fearless manner, the to
venality and corruption, that stalk- in
ed in high places. He pointed
the finger of scorn and flung de- res
fiance full in the faces of the mis- off
erable traitors, thieves and syco
phants, that were bartering for res
gold the birthrights of a free poo- off
ple. lie arose above the misera
ble conventionalities that had de- res
terred weaker men from perform- in
ing a like duty. The wretches that thi
had felt securely cloaked from ex- e
posure by virtue of the glamor of ad
the exalted position they had ]
been elevated to, were amazed and tbc
the thieves, traitors, bootlicks and me
sycophants looked in vain for some fd4
of their gang to arise to defend ae
them. Their consciences made ef
them cowards. All honest men lar
approved of all that he said. The at
house of Representatives, the Sen- ha
ate concurring, composed of the thi
chivalry of South Carolina, the de- to
oeadants of Calhoun, Hayne, Rhett the
and Hampton, hastened to an- or
nounce their unanimous approval chi
and indorsement of all that Senator ad,
Tilman had mid. Yet throughout a.
the land a subsidised press, run in the
the interest of those whose stock the
in trade is bartering the birth
rights of. ther fellow citizens, is
assiduously endeavoring to divert
the minds of the masses from the
true stite of affairs, by maligning
this great man. They do not dare of
to publish what be said, or attempt wI
to disprove a single charge he has fol
made. Their entire argument con
siste in calling him a blatherskite,
a hoodlum, he. This is the same
clams of miserable hirelings, that
i every age have demoanced pat
defts sd brave mm en ilaed to
sts fsor their rtigbt They ds
_mad our iloess j.tWa-hers.

State Platform
Feople's Party of Louisiana.
1. V aflirni our alltgianc" to
the 'pure principles of popular ro"\
ernment, as enunciated by Wash
ington, Jefferson and Jackson, and
emhbodied in our National platform,
and we uphold the principle em
bodied in the immortal declaration
that this should be "a Government
of the people, by the people and
for the people."
2 And especially do we de
mand the free and unlimited coin
aze of both gold and silver, at the
ratio of 14; to 1, with equal debt
paying power as primary money,
and a full legal tender monetary
system for the people of the Unit
ed States, without consulting any
foreign nation or money syndicate. m
3. We demand for Louisiana w.
industries equal protection to that '
afforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit- J
ish system of commercial laws,
that no discrimination against our
agricultural and industrial classes
may be made.
4. We favor a just and liberal
system of public schools for the
benefit of all classes of our people,
and we deplore the fact that for
many years the management of
our pu blic school system has been T
so defective that the party now in
power seeks to disfranchise a large
number of our citizens on the
grounds of ignorance.
5. We denounce the disgrace
ful and infamous election frauds A
which have prevailed in Louisiana,
End we demand and are determin- TI
ed to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall cast his b:l
lot freely and secretly, and the
vote shall be fairly counted as they
are actually cast. This is the su
preme issue in this campaign, and
in its suceess the honor, manhood
and prosperity of Louisiana are i
involved. The foul and loathsome
methods which have brought the
ballot box stuffer to the front, and
placed him in power in Louisiana,
must, in the name of liberty, jus
tice, morality and common decen
cy, be suppressed.
6. We oppose and denounce the F
proposed suffrageamendment, con
cocted by political schemers, not to
purify and elevate the ballot box
but to subserve their selfish pur
poses by providing contradictory
qualifications, to suddenly disfran
chise large masses of worthy citi
zens, by deluding the people with
promises of changes in the next
Legslature. We denounce the
whole amendment as a vicious
fraud which proposes measures and
methods that are un-American and
destructive of free institutions.
L 7. We favor the utmost econo
my of expenditures, in State, city
and. pasl', and pledge our pandi
dates to a striet and impatial en
forcement of all laws, and the pres
s ervation lad promotion of every
s interest in Louisiana, whose wel
f fare is bioader and more sacred
than party lines or partisan poli
cies ; and we invite and urge the
true men and honest eitizens of
Louisiana, without regard to past
party afiWiions to join with us in
e a noble, patriotio and powerful ef
fort to relieve our people and to
elevate the standard of politics
and public morality in our beloved
State.
