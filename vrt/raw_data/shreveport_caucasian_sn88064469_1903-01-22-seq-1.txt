MAX STERN
H.as He Skipped Where Is He? Will
He Turn Up?
Max Stern, a name if not known to
fame, is registered on the criminal re
cord on scveral charges for which he
has heen indicted by the grand jury. It
will be recalled that not long since Max
Stern was arrested for havihg in his
possession a lot of goods stolen fron;
a nnmber of merchants in this city. At
the time he stated that he had acquired
these goods honestly, in the course of
legitimate trade, and he was released
on bond, his sureties hbeing Wm. Win
ter $850: P. Youree $2so. Justin Gras
$4oo. Before the grand jury met Max
Stern was in town. in the court house.
but he has disappeared, at least Sheriff
\Ward and all his deputies have failed
to locate him or lay hands on him.
Where is Max Stern. the persecuted
man. who would face justice when called
to trial and prove to the world that he
is an i:noccnt man. He may turn up
and relieve his hondsmen.

ST. PETERK AT THE GATE.
(Speccially dedicated to hen-necked hus
hands.)
St. Peter stood at the golden gate
\\ ith a solemn mien and an air sedate,
\\hen up to the top of the golden stair
A man and a woman ascended there;
Aoplied for admission. They came and
stood
Before St. Peter., so great and good.
In hopes the City of Peace to win
And asked St. Peter to let them in.
The woman was tall and lank and thin,
With a shaggy heardlet on heri chin.
The man was thick and short and stout:
His stomach was built so it rounded out.
His face was pleasant and all the while
He wore a kindly and genial smile.
The choirs in the distance the echoes
woke,
And the man kept still while the wom
an spoke:
"O thou who guardcst the gate." said
"We two come hither beseeching thee
To, let us enter the heavenly land.
And ph y ,cur harps with the angel band.
Of.:tec. St. Peter, there is no doubt.
1here i:, nothing in heaven to bar me
I've been to the meetings three times a
% eek,
And almost always I'd rise and speak.
"I've told the sinners about the day
When they'll repent of their evil way.
I've told my neighbors-told them all
'Bout Adam and Eve and the primal
fall; ,
I've showed them what they'd have to
do
If they'd pass in with the chosen few,
I've marked their path of duty clear
Laid out the plan of their whole career.
"I've talked and talked to 'em loud and
long.
For my lungs are good and my voice is
strong;
So. good St. Peter, you'll clearly see
The gate of heaven is openf to me,
But my old man, r regret to say,
HIasn't walked in exactly ..the narrow
way;
lie smokes and he swears, and arave
faults he's got,
Ar.d I don't know whether he'll pass
,or not.
"'He never would pray with an earnest
$: I bad to lea sa
While I witv tltt.hosen united in

He ate what the pantry chanced tod# t f
