Tuesday. Go to your voting precinct

of the citizens for a native Georgian,

More than five
thousand veterans at
tended the reunion in
Atlanta last week,
and over half the
number were able to
participate in a fine
parade. Gen. Louis
D. Young', of Savan
nah, was elected Com
mander of the Geor
gia Division of the U.
C. V., and Athens
was chosen as the
next place of meet
ing. The weather
could not have been
more beautiful, nor
the occasion pleasant
er. All the Vets were
entertained royally
and seemed to enjoy themselves to
the utmost. The city was gaily dec
orated in their honor and nothing
marred the gathering of the old clan
in grey.

While the possibilities of war are
still present, the Eastern problem
continues to be rather more analyti
cal than menacing. Things have been
comparatively quiet in the Balkans
for the past few days. A dispatch
from London states that the diplo
mats there believe that Turkey and
Bulgaria will presently arrive at an
amicable understanding and that
there will be “t final breaking off of
negotiations between Turkey and Aus-

allegiance by Bulgaria; the formation
of a federation of Balkan states, and
the overthrow of the Triple Alliance
between Germany, Austria and
Italy.”
Another and very serious revolu
tion is now impending in Honduras,
headed by General Bonilla. Mexico
has been appealed to by friends of
the present government in Honduras,
to preserve order. A protectorate
may be established for that purpose.
The jails are said to be full of politi
cal prisoners and a clash of arms is
looked for at any time.
“ STOP IT, JOHN! THAT’S A RANK RECORD! ”
The muck-rake continues to keep
pretty busy in municipal affairs of
San Francisco. The latest there is
the discovery of a shortage in the
City Treasury of over $30,000, in con
nection with which former Tax Col
lector Edward Smith, at present serv
ing a term in the penitentiary for
forgery, and former City Teasurer
Chas. Bantel, are unpleasantly men
tioned, though no proofs of guilt are
positive. The latter is now in cus
tody.
Dr. A. J. McKelway, prominent
worker in the Child-Labor cause, has
announced that the Georgia Legisla
ture will be asked to amend the pres-
ent law against child labor by raising
the age limit to fourteen years.
It is with much regrets that the
general public learns that the munic
ipal ownership plan inaugurated in
Cleveland, Ohio, by its famous and
big-spirited mayor, Tom Johnson, has
received a severe setback. The fight
there has been going on a long time.
Every obstacle that could be conceived
and carried out by the interests op
posed to the plan has been resorted
to, in an effort to discredit the scheme.
At length, after being hectored in
every possible way —even to the pet
ty device of annoying street car con
ductors by payment of the small fare
in large bills which caused delays in
the service—the franchise of the mu
nicipal company was subjected to the
test of the referendum, and the fran
chise rejected by the small majority
of 600, out of a total vote of over
seventy thousand. Os course, the
Mayor and his supporters will con
tinue the struggle in the worthy ef
fort, but it has received an unfor
tunate check, going to show that in
every attempt of the people to gain
their rights the corporate interests
will fight to the last ditch.
President Castro and the Venezue
lan government are now in difficulty
with England, owing to the seizure of
a British ship and imprisonment of
its crew. The British minister at
Caracas has been ordered to make a
full report of the matter before any
definite move will be made toward de
manding reparation.
Russia, appears to be attempting a
land-grab in Persia. At a time when
the internal troubles, probable famine
and revolution in the latter country
makes her situation difficult, Russian
Cossacks have crossed the frontier.
Patriotic Persians will resist any ag
gressions to the utmost.
A conference is suggested between
the Governors and Mayors in the
Purple, white and green are the
colors adopted by the leading Suf
fragettes and these ladies have decid
edly ‘ 1 gone in” for good clothes of
thoroughly, feminine construction.
Madame Chaminade, who possess
es the distinction of being a success
ful musical composer,- has just ar
rived in New York from France and
will make a tour of the United
States.

son of the German Kaiser, has just

Southern States to
consider the question
of night-riding. The
?old-blooded and cow
ardly murder of
Quentin Rankin and
the attempted assas
sination of his law
partner, R. Z. Taylor,
by masked men, in
the Reelfoot Lake
district of Tennessee,
caused martial law to
be declared there
last week.. Governor
Patterson has offered
large reward for the
detection of the crim
inals, and many ar
rests have been
made.
An exhaustive re
port of the work of
the police force of
London during the
past year develops
the remarkable and
inexplicable fact that
crime in that city has
increased, while mis
demeanors have
grown less.
