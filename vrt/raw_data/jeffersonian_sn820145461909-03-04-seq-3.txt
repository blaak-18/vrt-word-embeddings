Some few years ago the world was
startled to read one morning that
Lieutenant-Governor Tillman, of South
Carolina, then retiring from office,
had shot and fatally wounded Nar
eisso Gonzales, editor of the Columbia
Daily State, one of the leading news
papers.
The causes that lay back of this
public act are all veiled, and when
viewed in their proper light and fitted
into their proper grooves reveal a feud
that long antedates that of the now
world-famous feud of Breathitt and
adjoining counties of Kentucky. The
Carolina feudists are a different class
of people; they are cultured and
refined; they belong to the old school
of “Before the war gentlemen.” The
class who make up the Kentucky feud
ist are ignorant, vicious, and narrow;
they live in their little mountain cir
cle, and illicit whiskey making and
selling constitute their principle
means of support.
The unwritten history of the cause
that led up to and culminated in that
startling tragedy sound like the fic
tions of the Middle Ages. Included in
the causes is one that goes back to the
bloody struggle of the common peo
ple in England and France for relig
ious and political liberties which par
tially acknowledged in the Magna
Charta of England.
The common people fled from Eng
land and France and with a courage
and dauntless determination faced the
wild animals and still wilder men of
the American forest. They by energy
and incessant toil won for themselves
a home in the wilds of the forest.
Their labors had made them self-re
liant, and the dangers they faced
made them courageous to a fault.
The great English philosopher, John
Locke, drew up a form of government
for the grant which the king made to
eight of his lords and noblemen, and
which in honor of King Charles was
called Carolina. The Latin for
Charles was Carolus, and hence the
name Carolina. Both North and
South Carolina was included at that
time as one province and belonged by
*grant to these eight English noble
men.
The plan of Locke was to create
eight baronial estates, thus dividing
the two states as we now'know them
into eight principalities, governed af
ter the manner of the ancient Feudal
System of the Dark Ages. The pro
prietor was to live in the midst of the
estate in a castle and farm his
lands to vassals who were to
pay an annual rental, and be at all
times in the service and under the
direction of the Lord Proprietor. No
retainer could own or cultivate a foot
of land unless the lord first gave his
consent. Some of the earlier statutes
made it a felony to cut even so much
as a riding switch from the roadside
without having first obtained the no
bleman’s consent.
The experiment proved a miserable
failure, but a certain direction was
given to the sentiment of the people
who settled in the southern part of
the state, and especially those who
came to live along the Atlantic sea
board. A few of the second sons of
English nobility made their homes
there. They were useless and worth-

less ornaments of a profligate and in
some cases immoral society in their
home land. They had come to Caro
lina with the idea that they had a di
vine right to rule, and that their word
was to be believed before anybody
else’s. They toiled not, neither did
they spin, but they collected the tax
and governed the common people
They were supercilious and autocrat
ic; they governed with a rod of iron
and woe betide the wretch that failed
to pay his tax or to pay due reverence
to the station of nobility.
This second son was as a rule
a graceless scamp who not only
ruined the people financially but
would if the slightest opportunity of
fered, enter the home of the settler
and seduce his daughters and some
times his wife, if she was young and
good looking.
Later came the French, the Carolina
consignment of those kidnaped in No
va Scotia and immortalized in Long
fellow’s Evangeline. They soon came
to believe that owing to special fa
vors of providence that they were of
a finer mould of clay than the settlers.
About this time settlers from North
Carolina and Virginia began to pour
into the northern section of the state
and settle along the rocky foothills of
the Blue Ridge. These people differed
in religion, in traits of character, and
in disposition from those south of
them. Between these two settled sec
tions was an almost impassable bar
rier, the sand hills. The people on
the north did not pass down to those
on the south, while those in the south
did not wish to pass over and mix
with those north of the sand hills.
The sand hill section was settled
by fugitives from the pirate ships of
Captain Kidd and the more intoler
able criminals and reprobates of both
sections. In those days the criminal
was as safe in the sand hills of South
Carolina as if he had been in the
jungles of Africa. Many of them co
habited with negro women and Indi
ans, producing a race peculiar to the
Carolina sand hill regions, the like of
which is found nowhere else in the
world.
These two sections remained as sep
arate and distinct as if they had been
two different races or two different
nations with an impassable mountain
between them till the Revolutionary
War, when a common interest drew
them together. The common people
sided with the American cause and the
nobility adhered to the king. The
American Army was successful, and
many of the Tories fled. Some, how
ever, remained and others came back
under a general amnesty law passed
by the legislature some years after
wards.
The sons and daughters of the Rev
olutionary heroes and the Tory nobil
ity married and intermarried, thus
producing a peculiar civilization, the
like of which had never been known
before or will ever be known again.
These conditions in the south section
being conducive to such a civilization,
that part of the state came to believe
that it had a divine right, bestowed
by the Creator himself, to rule with
out hindrance, x
The people in the north section
owned small homes and loved liberty.
Cfoe Jeffersonian
They cherished the principles be
queathed to them by the Revolution
ary fathers as a priceless treasury.
They tilled their small farms, taking
no part in the great political battles
between Whig and Tory or Democrat
and Republican. They were content
to let others run the government and
collect the taxes, if they were only
allowed to enjoy the liberties and
privileges guaranteed by the Consti
tution.
The south section held all the of
fices and dictated the policy of the
state government. They held the ma
jor portion of slaves, and felt them
selves to be the superiors of the hard
working class that lived north of the
sand hills.
From the close of the Revolutionary
War down to the Civil War there was
discontent and mutterings on the part
of the people in the north section were
frequent, but nothing was done. Noth
ing could be done. The people were
discouraged, and too frequently satis
fied to let things go on as they were
going. Here and there some one was
bold enough to lift a voice of protest.
The children of the two sections
were taught to think of each other as
enemies. The years came and went
and this feeling grew and became
stronger. The people of the south
section regarded the people of the
north section as unfit to mix in good
society and the people of the north
section looked upon the low country
folks as stuck up and proud. The
breach was widening, ever widening,
with each generation.
The Civil War wrought for a few
years a remarkable change in the po
litical complexion of the governing
class in Columbia. The people of both
sections forgot for a time the strife
among themselves in the greater strife
and wrong of Reconstruction. Bitter
ness of a social nature between An
glo-Saxons were forgotten in the
greater bitterness towards the negro
and the carpet-bagger.
At last the people, irrespective of
creed or political line up, arose and
threw off the yoke of the alien and
the despoiler. When the yoke had
been thrown off, the same old class
returned to power. They had learned
nothing, forgotten nothing. They
looked with disdain and contempt up
on the toiler and the bread winner.
They were the same well favored of
providence; they had the same divine
right to rule.
Under conditions and circumstances
like these the Alliance came, going as
it did into every nook and corner of
the state, solidifying and combining
the widely scattered but much dissat
isfied common people. Benjamin R.
Tillman, from the northern section of
the state, a farmer and one who had
thought much on the existing eondi
ditions, was called to head the host.
Victory overwhelming was the result.
Those who had for more than a hun
dred years been in favor felt all
too keenly the sting of defeat. Back
of the defeated was the universal
training through generations that Till
man and his followers had no right to
govern or have any voice in the mak
ing of laws whatever.
