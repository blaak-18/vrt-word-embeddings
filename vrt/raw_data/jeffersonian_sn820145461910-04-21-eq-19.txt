self in the embarrassing position of having to
go to his near enemies to get what his friends
are unable to give.
Aldrich is afraid to test his strength in the
Senate, and Cannon is no longer able to gag
the House and force through measures. The
President is up a tree, and the only way for
him to get down is to saw off the limb on
which he is sitting.
The Inadequate Pay of the R. F. D.
Carriers
Dear Sir:—l know your time is
valuable, but if you have not time to
answer this personally, if you have
space, ’twill be highly appreciated if
you will publish in your weekly Jef
fersonian :
Ist. Do you believe the rural car
rier is paid enough for his services,
considering the expense attached to
the work, such as maintaining at
least two horses, sometimes three,
with buggies, etc?
2d. The average rural carrier’s
salary is about $75.00 per month,
or less, with the expense of keeping
up his outfits and numerous minor
expenses connected therewith, ’twill
be readily seen by a person of reason
that his salary is cut in half.
3. The carrier is required to stand
an examination at beginning of
service, which places him on a more
intelligent basis than the laboring
man, and his work requires a higher
standard than the latter, yet the la
borer, on an average, commands
forty to fifty dollars per month,
minus expense connected with his
work-
4th. In justice to the patient,
hard-working servant, the rural car
rier, who does not expect to derive
monthly, excluding actual expense,
more than about thirty-five dollars,
would it not seem they were an ill
paid body of faithful public servants
in comparison with current cost of
living and the salary of one hun
dred dollars per month to city car
riers; nor is the poor rural carrier
fault-finding or discriminating in the
in the service, for he only wants
justice, but ’tis such a lamentable
fact that he hasn’t any “champion
for his cause.”
sth. In regard to “Parcels Post”
the rural carrier, as faithfully as
ever, is glad to welcome any progress
or benefit for the uplift of the farm
er whom ’tis his duty to serve, and
he does it WELL, as is shown by the
“March of Progress” of the farms
and farmers in the last decade.
Along with the call for the parcels
post, why cannot our strong daily
and weekly papers also AROUSE the
millions of farmers to beseech their
Congressmen to give justice to the
faithful carrier who goes forth in
the cold or rain, sleet or snow, to
perform his daily work?
“Render unto Caesar the things
that are Caesar’s.”
Now, Mr. Watson, will yours be
one of the papers to help the carrier,
for you will be thanked by each and
every one most heartily, and, too, in
conclusion, ’tis a fact that you should
be proud of being the author of the
R. F. D. service, and had it not been
for you we, the people, may never
had the present benefits of such a
good service.
Yours for the carrier,
Davisboro, Ga. A. B.
Answer.
(1) In considering the enormous
advance in the cost of living which
has been made since the new tariff
law went into effect, I do not believe
that the rural carriers are paid
enough. In comparison with the
salaries paid the other officials of the
government, I consider that the ru
ral carrier is the victim of discrimi
nation.
(2) I don’t see how any white
man, living in an ordinarily comfort
able manner, can support himself
and his family and maintain a horse
He has been forced to call to the White
House the insurgent Congressmen, among
them F ish, of New York, the insurgent whom
the regulars hate most; he has begged them
to get together and caucus on his legislative
program.
The insurgents would treat the President
right if they made him sweat away a few
pounds of fat for acting as he has. They
and buggy for $75. per month and
have anything left-
(3) Your illustration is a good
one, and amounts to an argument
which cannot be answered.
(4) I agree with you fully, and
would be willing to use what in
fluence I have to secure an advance
in the pay of these carriers.
(5) I fully agree with you as to
your purpose; but instead of the
word beseech, I would use the word
demand. Public officers are public
servants, and we have got the cart
before the horse when we “beseech”
them to do anything which is legiti
mate and necessary. If the people
would do more in the way of insist
ent demanding, and less in the way
of idle grumbling, results would be
more satisfactory. Demand of your
Congressman what is your right, and
turn him out at the next election if
he doesn’t give it to you.

THE UPRIGHT MAN.
Dowered with the primal virtues of
truth and reason and right,
He is the light of leading, leading the
way to light;
Backed by a quiet purpose, earnest
in honor’s strife,
He is the flame and flower of the
sweet and the simple life;
Fearless of kings and cohorts, chari
ots churning the dust,
He is the perfect spirit based on a
deathless trust.
Stainless, peerless, unpurchased,
building his power clean,
He is the soldier serving man and
not the machine;
Truth for his mighty fortress, zeal,
and a will to go,
Under his feet they scatter, the ranks
of the unclean foe,
And the hooves of the beasts of plun
der, over the plain they fly
At the sting of his tongue of scath
ing, the glance of his Argus eye-
Cursed, maligned, detested, muddied
and stained and scorned,
He is the friend of the people whose
coming the mutts have mourned;
Open his course, and manly; war to
the knife, but war
Where the impious gain no quarter,
and the banners borne before
Are stainless pennants of duty, with
personal ends forgot
In the aim of the sovran service for
the good of the common lot.
Decked with the foeman’s slander,
hail him, the upright man!
Leading the warfare righteous with
his keen blade in the van;
Then, at the moment’s triumph,
turning from crown and bay
To hurl at the despot’s columns the
force of his iron array;
Ceaseless fighter of battles, tireless,
whose toil is rest,
Till the fields are the fields of silence,
and the lilies are on his breast!

Those who thought that Tom Wat
son was just talking on the subject
of missions to hear his mouth rattle
evidently did not stop to take their
bearings. His exposition of the sub
ject in last Sunday’s Constitution
shows that he has given the subject
much study and is as familiar with
prevailing conditions in the Orient as
Mr. Ellis or Mr. Anybody else. His
position appears to be very logical.
He is in favor of carrying the gospel
to the heathen, —but bucks at carry
ing them raiment, rations, medicine,
gold teeth, free education and free
literature, while our own Georgia
boys and girls are crying for bread
should make him remember that he refused to
give them any patronage because they would
not bow to Cannon and Aldrich, and they
should treat him in such away as would make
him think twice before he rides around the
country again proclaiming the Aldrich-Payne
tariff law the best ever, and praising Aldrich
as a constructive statesman and old Cannon as
a useful man.
