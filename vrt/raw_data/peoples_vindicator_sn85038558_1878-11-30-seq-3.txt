to establish street lamps in our city by

'-There's chiel among ye taking notes thc
Andl faith he'll print 'cn." N
A Texas drover with a numbler of "cow hr
boys" was driving a heard tf cattle to
market and in passing a farm house, an
old brindle ox with broad horns was e
driven along with the herd. The owner fol
saw the occurrence and shouted lustily to let
the Texan to stop. "Look here, mister, th
you've got one of my stock in that gang ot'
of yonr'n." "None of that, replied the l
Texan, "Do you take me for a cow thief "' a
"I'll bet you have though, said the farm- pl
er, and Ill show you tarnation quick', pl
"Brindle, brindle," he called. The broad th
horn stopped and then walked up to the Its
farmer, who threw his arm across the er
animal's back and looking at the Texan
said, "Thar, I told you so." The Texan
was dumfounded and exclaimed, "Boys,
I'll be dod-burned if that don't beat the if
devil, tail, hoofs, horns and all, That's
none of our lay out, and never saw the
praries of Texas. Drive on boys. That
beats me how he tamed that old broad
horns."
A little energy shows how quickly a
r public enterprise can be accomplished. "c
1 Last Tuesday, Mr. T. P. Chaplin, Parish [(
Attorney, conceived the idea of lighting fo
St. Denis street with lamps at the head q(
of the street and at the corner on Second hi
street. In fifteen minutes he had raised tr
sufficient funds to put up the lamp posts te
at the designated points, from the ree
idents in that locality. Let the citizens tr
along the most public and travelled
thoroughfares do the'same and our an
cient town will be illuminated and ea
1 there will be no more splashing R'
1 through mud holes and stumbling over ca
the dilapidated pavements, on such dark at
nights as those of last Monday and Tues- ly
day. tl
After several days of Spring like weath
er, it clouded up last Sunday, and to- -
t wards night it began to rain, with dark It
storm clouds overhead. The wind veered ri
1 from South East to North West, S
B and at night-fall the rain descended in 0
Â° torrents, accompanied with vivid flashes di
of lightning and heavy thunder. It fell
steadily all Monday and Tuesday, turn
r ing hypoborean, and finally clearing off
cold Wednesday morning.
The late rains have doubtless put
water in the lakes hereabouts, and the m
duck hunters are out in force after these
I migratory fowls.
"Roundy" called into the Clerk's office
recently and found that official and his
a deputy in high old glee. He modestly
g enquired the cause of so much hilarity,
e when he was triumphantly pointed to
it the list of marriage licenses. Well
r- "Roandy" calculates that as the quar- t
h antine is ended the young folks have a e
't right to take advantage of that event. tC
"Roundy" dropped into the Post office
I last Wednesday to ask for his New Or
Sleans papers. They were all there, Mr. et
f Editor, but good Lord! in what a condi- tl
tiou ! The papers a mass of pulp and the ii
Sletters with directions erased. Cannot
the contractor on the route be held res
s ponsible for exposing the mail sacks,
n without protection, to the rain while in
transit T That's what both "Roundy"
of and about 1200 other citizens, want to
il know.
"Roundy" had a grip of the Secretary
Is of State's leftpaw, this week, and was
Is glad to see him looking as robust and I
x- smiling as ever. Our State official be- a
as longs most assuredly, to the class yelept
of "We, the "People."
More improvements going on! Col.
le Parsons is putting an addition to the
e. building on the corner of Horn and Second
streets, and it is soon to be occupied as
a store. That's right. March on.
Christmas is coming, Mr. Editoi~, "Roun
dy" knows it, from the quantity of fresh
Spork, chickens, turkeys, etcetera, which
begin to arrive, and the good things,
ie knick knacks, &c., which the vendors
a carry out of stores. Say, Mr. Edilor, let
e "Roundy" whisper in your year saftly,
a dreamily, lovingly, "Give us a bite off
a that extra fat turkey, when yoe get him.
nr Say, now, won't you."
nt He labored earnestly, zealously, yea
er, more muchly than he has, for lo I these
ke many days. He dropped a few grains of
or. corn on the ground and then backed off.
That big black hog kept following him.
Still he droppedcorn, backed up like a
on stubborn mule, and that porcine had no
better sense than to attempt to run
by against him with his nose. "Roundy"
set sincerely hopes that the obstinate brute
>pe did not eventually eatoh that citizen and
ra root him over. But "Roandy" does hope
that he eucceededin getting the animal
e. safely home out of the reach of the"pow
ere that be."

p. Mr. Editor, "Roundy" notifies you,

Natchitoches Parish is one huge political
brotherhood. Keep the ball in motion.
Last Thursday was the National thanks
giving. In this locality 'Roundy"' per
ceived no observance thereof, the citizens
following their usual avocations. Doubt
less in more Northern clines there was
the proverbial turkey, mince pies and
other edibles, around which assembled the
happy family circles, doing justice to the
well spread board, after attending some
place of worship. Surely the good peo.
ple of Natchitoches have every reason
this year to be thankful and "Roundy"
hspes they are sincerely inwardly, wheth
er they show it outwardly or not.
Jack Frost predominated here thanks

earth, every visible object, was covered as
if with a mantle of snow. Seasonable

Quarantine.
Our merchants in New Orleans
must remember that their duties do
not extend to "health regulations,"
nor does the public appeal to them
for an opinion on the question of
quarantine. The fever commission
has already decided what the "coun
try bucks" up Red river demonstra
ted, that when communication be
tween a yellow fever infected die
trict and a healthy one is prohibited,
it is utterly impossible for the des
ease to readi the healthy section.
Red river had scattering yellow fever
cases as high as the steamboats came,
and none above. Galveston is clear
- ly in the fever Zone (so.called) and
they escaped by a vigorous quarantine.
New Orleans must elect her choice
- -she must choose between the West
India trade or the trade of the inte
I rior, during the Summer months.
Should yellow fever prevail in New
1 Orleans next year she will be blocka- A
ded to her very surburbs.
ITS TRUE INWARDNESS.
Why the Outrage Mill has been set -
up in Louisiana,
Mr. Hayes of opinion that noth
ing can be made of prosecu
tions in the Parishes, and pro
poses to take advantage of the
breach between the Democrats
and the Citizens in this City.
[Special to the N. O. Democrat.]
I Washington, Nov. 20.--It appears
that thle administration has decided
to take no forther notice ofthe charg
Ses nmade against Leonard and Whar
ton, desciibed in a recent special.
At all events, the order for Wharton
e to report here and explain his alleged
want of zeal has been countermand
r. ed. Some Louisianians here say
- this is due to the renewed confidence
e inspired by District Attorney Leon
4 ard's ferocity while here, but my own
impression is that Hayes and his ad
visers have taken a sober second
, thought and decided not to yield al
Stogether to the demand of the stal-
Swart mob.
;o There is much curiosity here among
both Republicans and Democrats to
see how Leonard will work at the t
7 crank of the outrage mill.
5s Kellegg, for some reason, has late-I tl
id ly become very conservative, andi,
e- advisees Hayes against anything like 'ti
pt wholesale prosecution under the bay- i
onet act. ti
Hayes thinks it would be the best a
1. policy to ignore the alleged outrages
be in the parishes, and concentrate the i
Id Federal machinery on the quarrel
between the Democrats and the Citi- e
zens' Association in New Orleans, if C
any hold can be got there. He holds
- that prosecutions of that style in the
h outlying parishes, based on negro
testimony, will have but little weight r
as compared with. positive develop
, menits in the New Orleans muddle.
rs BUELL.
ly, Some Ball.dolng.c
SGeneral Butler says that the intim
idation of the white voters in Mas-t
sachusetts during the recent election
sa was as flagrant as ever the intimida
se tion of negro voters in the South was.
of He asserts that the interference with
d the right of the poor laborer to vote
as he saw fit, though more cunningly
a. managed in Massachusetts than in the
SSouth, was based on the same theroy
no of politics. Certainly General Butler
an has no greater reason to misrepresent
y" the people of his own State than he
ite formerly had to misrepresent the peo
d ple of South Carolina or Louisiana.
Are we to suppose that he is mista
pe ken then, or did he speak the truth
i then and has he spoken it sow?

THE SUN FOR 1879.
o Tas SUN will be published every day durin
Sthe year to come Its purpose and method wt1
be the same a in the pt : To present all the

). though the heavens fall.
d The Sn has been, is. and will continue to be
independent of everybody and everything save

is the only poliey which an honest newspaper
need have. That is the policy which has won for
this newspaper the confidence and friendship of
t a wider constituency than was ever before en.
joyed by any other American Journal.
The Suntis the newspaper for the people. It
to is not for the rich man against the poor man, or
ci for the poor man against the rich man, but it
seeeks to do equal Justice to all Interests in the
community. It is not the organ of any person,
if class, sect or party. There need be no mastery
Ib about its loves and hates. It is for the honest ci
man against the rogues every time. It eis for the
10 honest Democrat as against the dishonest Rep- or
ro ublican, and for the honest Republican as against
the dishonest Democrat. It does not take its uone
t from the utterance of any politician or political
. orgmanisation. It gives its support unreservedly
when men or measures are in agreeance with
the Constitution and with the principas upon
which this Benublic was founded for the people
Whenever the Constitution and constitutional.
principles are violated-as in the outrageous
conspracy of 1876, by which a man not elected
wars placed in the President's oftioe, where he
still remina.it sperks out for the right. That li

Sgone b. The San will continue to shine on the
Swiked with unmitigated brightness.
to While the lesson of the pat should be con.
si atantly kept before the people, The sun does
Sno preposMe to make itselin 189 a magazine of
