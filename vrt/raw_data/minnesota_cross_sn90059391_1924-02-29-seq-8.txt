ters from anti-bonus workers to
large corporations and wealthy men.
He statecf that the Legion will pre
sent these letters to the senate bonus

lets will be distributed at a cost of
$200,000, Quinn said. Quinn called on

The Jewish Attitude
Jewish newspapers all over the
country are attacking the proposed
immigration bill. Most of them car
ry dispatches to the effect that Rep
resentative Longworth, of Ohio. Re
publican floor leader of the house,
confirms the report that Representa
tive La Guardia. of New York, had
appeared before the steering com
mittee of the house and warned the
members of the committee against
Sushing the Johnson immigration

The Jewish Exponent runs this
week a long editorial in which it
says that the Johnson bill should
more properly be called the Ku KJux
Klan bill.

Indicted for Murder
News comes from Pittsburgh that
the Allegheny county grand jury has

murder against rPatrick J. McDer
mott, a Catholic rioter, in connec
tion with the killing of Thomas R-
Abbott, Klansman, during a riot be

by Mrs. Emma Abbott, wife of the

Tax Reduction Threatened
There is some danger that the
house and senate will be unable to
agree on a compromise in the tax
reduction measure acceptable to the
? resident. Mr. Coolidge in his New
ork speech condemned the Garner
substitute for the Mellon plan as un
workable and “political.”
House administration leaders cling
to the hope that they will be able,
before the bill leaves the house, to
change the Garner program on in
come taxes so that it will be accept
able at the White House. Failing in
this, their only hope now is that the
senate will work out a plan which
will be accepted in the house when
the bill is sent back. But all of
these hopes are rather dim, in the
face of the decisive defeats suffered
thus far by the Republicans in try
ing to get the Mellon plan through

LAW STUDENTS COUNT
MAYFIELD’S BALLOTS
Senator Spencer Sarcastically
Says Tabulation Will Take
Five Years
(Bureau of I'ublleation and Fdueallon)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 20-
Men are busy nowadays counting the
ballots in the contested senatorial
election in Texas in November, 1922.
The counting is being done on the
first floor of the senate office build
ing in Washington, under the super
vision of the senate elections sub
committee appointed to investigate
George E. B. Peddy’s contest of the
seat of Senator Mayfield.
Twenty-eight counters were put to
work, all of them young men who
are attending a law school here, their
selections having been made by vari
ous senators, for the work. They be
gan with the ballots of Anderson
county, Texas, first. These were
found so badly jumbled that it re
quired about two days to complete
the count. Senator Spencer, chair
man of the committee, says that if all
the other Texas counties are in the
same shape, that it will take about
five years to complete the count, and
by that time Senator Mayfield’s term
will have expired. He added, how
ever, that such was not the case,
and he hopes to finish the count in
about 30 days.
The ballots from about 240 Texas
counties hav*e been received in Wash
ington, and they are under lock and
key and guarded by three armed
guards, one of whom is always on
watch.
Col. Edward Thayer, of Indianapo
lis, sergeant-at-arms of the Republi
can National committee, is assisting
the senate committee in looking af
ter the counters and various details
of the work. He also made a trip
to Texas and kept tab on the 40 dep
uty sergeants-at-arms of the senate
down there while they were gather
ing up the ballots and ballot boxes.

tion was blocked on objection by

Senator Lodge’s objection was
based on the unusual procedure of
the Montana senator in naming the
personnel of the proposed investiga
tors, stating that he had never
known “a reflection of this kind to

Mayor Hired Men
to Intimidate
Klan is Charge
MANHATTAN, KANS., Feb. 25.
Learning of affidavits placed before
the city commission by W. T. Brown,
Kansas City, Mo., attorney, which
stated that Mayor Jack C. Barber
had conspired to incite a riot and
disturbance of the peace by hiring
six men of this place to throw eggs
at a lecturer, who was speaking here
last October under the auspices of
the hu Klux Klan, citizens of Man
hat ten are describing Mayor Bar
ber’s action as an attempt to imitate
“Jack" Walton, deposed governor of
Oklahoma.
Brown, as observer, told the com
mission that the Ku Klux Klan had
been denied the right of free speech
and peaceable assemblage in the pub
lic park and in the community
house. In an affidavit referring to
Mayor Barber’s conversation previous
to the egg throwing, he is quoted as
saying, “Go ahead boys, and have all
the fun you want to. They are break
ing the law anyway, so do anything
you want to, I am back of you. And
whatever you do, nothing will hap
pen to you.” Another affidavit states
that he paid the egg throwers $1
each. The first affidavit was signed
by seven men and the second by five
men.

STORY OF KIDNAPPING
REFUTED BY KLANSMEN
Newspaper Says 40 or 50 Robed
Men, Absconded With
Cripple
PITTSBURGH, PA., Feb. 23 An in
stance of the readiness to lay blame
for all lawless action at the door of
the Klan was given here Tuesday
with the publication on the first
page of the Pittsburgh Sun, Demo
cratic evening, newspaper, of a story
telling of the kidnaping of an aged
cripple at Dravosburg by men wear
ing the robes of the Ku Klux Klan.
Forty or 50 robed men, the story
read, forcibly entered the humble
home of the crippled man, dragged
him from his bed, and caused his
disappearance. The story told fur
ther of “shooting in the air” and oth
er “bad acts.” The reason 40 or 50
men would be required to remeve a
crippled man from his home was not
given in the story, nor could it be
sensed by intelligent readers of the
paper.
However, Sam I). Rich, Imperial
Representative. Realm of Pennsyl
vania, immediately denounced the
action of the body of men and right
ly declared that they were not mem
bers, had never been affiliated, and
that their character, as evidenced
by the alleged attack, would have
prevented them from ever being
members.
County detectives immediately be
gan investigations and stated later
that they had information that would
probably lead to the arrest of seven
of the men.
AH of the other Pittsburgh paper*
buried the story in their news col
umns and were fair enough to lay
the act to white-robed men, not
Klansrnen.
