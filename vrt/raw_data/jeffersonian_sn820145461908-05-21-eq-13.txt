OUT, COUNTRY DEMOCRATS!
If that new Hoke Smith rule stands,
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR RIGHTS.
Does my friend Brannan think it wise
to revolutionize our system in this way—
OFFERING TEMPTATION AND OP
PORTUNITY TO THE WORST PO
LITICIANS OF THE BIG CITIES?
* H
Editorial Notes.
By J. D. Watson.
When the New York Legislature refus
ed to pass the Anti-Race-Track Gambling
bill, which Governor Hughes and the
people of New York wanted passed. Gov
ernor Hughes did not bend his knee to
the Legislature and say that he was satis
fied with what they had done.
Instead of surrendering to Belmont and
the gamblers in this way, he immediate
ly issued a call for an extra session of the
Legislature, and went before the people
of his State and told them why the bill
had been defeated.
In one Senatorial district a vacancy had
occurred. Into that district Governor
Hughes went and told the people what
interests defeated the bill, and the candi
date who was in favor of its passage
was elected to fill the vacancy.
By the time the Legislature met in
extra session one of the strong sup
porters of the bill was seriously ill, and
the Belmont crowd was again happy, but
again they had mistaken the man with
whom they were dealing.
Instead of sending the bill to the Legis
lature and risking another defeat, the
Governor has put other measures before
it and held up the Race Track bill un
til the sick Senator can recover.
Here is a Governor who is an exam
ple for other Governors to follow, and
well they would do to follow him.
He may finally be defeated in his ef
forts to have the Legislature do what the
people want done, but the people have
the satisfaction of knowing that he has
the courage to take the stump and tell
them the truth about it so they may elect
men who WILL do their will.
To say the least, he does not back
squarely down from the fight and say:
“I have no adverse criticism to place on
the Legislature.”

Just as was predicted, as the time for
the meeting of the Republican conven
tion draws nearer the stronger grows the
possibility that President Roosevelt- may
be the nominee.
While Secretary Taft is far in the lead,
he is recognized as the President’s candi
date and can be easily persuaded to step
aside if the President can be persuaded to
accept the nomination.
In fact the other candidates’ friends
charge that Taft is only a mere stalking
horse in the race.
But the wise politicians hold that Mr.
Roosevelt’s nomination is the only logical
outcome of the remarkable conditions
which he has created, and that the pres-
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
sure for him at Chicago is sure to be
irresistible.
The latter have the situation sized up
just about right.
The Socialists have made their nomina
tion for President. Eugene V. Debs
will again head their ticket.
The Comrades didn’t have such a
smooth sailing time of it as they would
lead us to believe that Socialism insures.
They denounced one another and wran
gled in continuous session for eighteen
hours before they could make a nomina
tion, just as any other political convention
would.
The man who placed Debs’ name be
fore the convention denounced President
Roosevelt as the greatest coward known
to history.
This is about as near the truth as the
average Socialist orator usually gets.
n
Governor Hughes has again urged the
New York Legislature, which he has
called in extra session, to investigate Wall
street stock gambling, and to enact legis
lation to prevent further damage to ligiti
mate business from that evil.
This is a piece of State legislation that
is of vital interest to the Nation, and if it
is enacted into law will benefit the South
as much as any other section.
It is in Wall street where Rockefeller,
Morgan, Harriman, Ryan, Belmont and
others play the game which robs the
country of millions of dollars every year.
HUH
MORE FLOOD DANGER.
If, as Thomas F. Ryan before the New
York special grand jury, investigating the
affairs of the Metropolitan Traction company
admitted, 95 per cent of the stock of all the
steam and street railroads of the country
consists of water, then the nation can con
gratulate itself that it escaped drowning
without being compelled, like Noah and his
folks, to build arks. The admission, which
reveals the magnitude of the public dangeh,
ought to incidentally prove the best boost for
the Submarine Boat company. Let us have as
many submarines as possible, lest we be
drowned like cats. —Memphis News-Scimitar.
If happiness is the rarest of blessings, it
is because the reception of it is the rarest
of virtues. —Silvestre.
The majesty of man can not be measured
until he is seen standing in a magnificent
minority.

Sick?
Much sickness is due to
a weak nervous system.
Yours may be. If it is,
you cannot get well until
you restore nerve strength
Your nervous system is
nature’s power house; the
organs of your body get
their power from it. If
the power is not there, the
action of the organs is
weak, and disease (sick
ness) follows. Dr. Miles’
Nervine cures the sick
because it soothes the
irritated and tired nerves
and gives the system a
chance to recuperate.

not quickly feel its bene
ficial effect.
