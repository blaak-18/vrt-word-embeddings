The First Kiss of Love.
Oh, the first kiss of love,
How it thrills on the lips;
When from the mouth of the dear one
lt nector we sip.
How it bianes tb* nerves,
And makes a man feel,
As tho' he could rush
Thro' squadrons of stetl.
how it ,luicken tlh blood,
In its rapturous flow :
How it flushes the cheek,
With its roseate glow.
How it lights up the eyes.
How it stirs up the heart:
As tho' it woutld seem
Its tendrils would part.
Oh, the first kiss of love,
1 shall ever remember;
How it snatch'h it all glowing,
From the lips of the trembler.
When e'er I forget,
That feast of the soul,
The tide of oblivion,
Thro' my bosom must roll.
Must hid recollection,
Forever depart :
And still with its murmurs,
Ther voice of the heart!
T he White Man's Party in Lou
isiana.
From the N. O. Bulletin.
In the Republican Congressional
caucus at Washington City, a colored
Congressman of Mississippi, asserted I
that there was but one party which f
the negroes could join, and that was,
'the Republcan party.
That such is'the prevailing opinion I
among the colored people, hardly ad- i
mits of a doubt: the colored Con.
gressinan was, on that occasion, sim.
ply the echo of his people. This pro- i
position, however, is unfounded. The t
colored people, as a race, are not com
pelled by a sense of insecurity to con
solidate their forces, as they have t
done, under the banner of the Re- 
publican party.
Their rights, political and civil, are
fuily guaranteed and protected by a
stringent provisions of Federal and c
State constitutions, and of Federal ri
add State laws. They should have
sought the enjoyment of life, liberty
and property under common legisla- o
tion ; but they attempt to obtain by g
coercion the enjoyment of certain -
rights and privileges, which they
claim as civil and political, without u
regard to the claims of others, equal
ly interested, and bearing equal rights
and privileges. Here they did not I
stop; but they organized their leagues, .
and even their societies, upon the ba- k
sis of race and color, and, as a race, a
constitute the Republican party in r,
Louisiana and other reconstructed
States--Africaniznmg there the Repub- p
lican party. tV
The negro is essentially a Republi-. o
can partisan, whether he wills it or ,h
not; indeed, in the bulk of cases this ti
is not a matter of volition with him, h
but one of race and color. If he 0
imagines for one moment that he can tl
break the spell, and, as an American p
freeman, exercise his own individual IN
government in the selection of his 51
own political course, apart from the ac
bulk of his race, he finds hanging
over his head the sword of Damocles a
-the penalty of treason to his race. I
The Republican party of Louisiana it
being thous Africanized, and the State el
government falling into their hands, ' I
as a nacessary consequence there is tl
developed the tendency to Africanize 3
the government itself. Such a ten- N
dency is but the natural consequence ai
of rearing the party in power upon a E
question of races. The tendency, at ca
first, does not spear in bold relief;
but with time and gradual, but sue- N
cessful inroads, the evil assumes '
threatening proportions. tl
On the other hand, and as a logical ti
sequence, the colored people are
taught and believe that the Demo- P
cratic party is the white man's party ti
-that this party designs their depri- R
vation of civil atd political rights, b
which are inow commobn to all citi- 11
zens. ft
As matters now stand the next ce
campaign in Louisiana will pivot on tI
the matter of race, and that,' too, P
under the direct provocations, of the at
colored people. They have forced
the issue whether this commonwealth
is to be governed by negroes or white
men, and they are determined, by ,i
some sort of fatality, to attempt to ft
Africanize the State government. ,
The white people cannot, if they of
would, avoid the issue. They may w
close their eyes not to see; but never- i
theless the irrepiressible confliot is "
coming. Rplias
SIa.LoulisianaRepublicnnim means
Africanization-the consummation of $1
the last six years of misgovernment
and rain; and these Radicals cousid
er themselves sute of success as long w
*as they can see the white people of oh
LouiSiana fail to meet theisene squjare- di
ly by the use of the same mode of al
warfare. tt
We must have a thorough and per- e•
Sfeet organization throughout the lit
State, and we must proceed systema- in
tically about it, by districting the hi
cities and parishes, and opening ti
books in which eery white man who
is at citizen shall enroll himnself, pledg
ed to support wiTite aen for otlice and
to act with the white party in the
great work of redeeming Louisi:na
from rnegro and carpet-bag boldage,
and of restoring her to somethiug of
e her pristine glory.
"The Friend of the South."
The Chicago Y"ribune also notes thei
protest that all accounts from the
South i;:tlicate that the President ati
this time is Ioot,d upon in that .sec
tion as the future friend of the white
people in their struggle with the col
ored race for political supremacy,
through precious little evidence has
I1e given as yet of any special interest
in their behoof.--1N. Y. Herald.
, The Chicago T'ribune and the New
York Herahl, to, too, y regard,it as a
fixed fact that if the people of the
South see indications on the part of
President Grtint to restore to them!
good government, and to side with
the intelligent government, and well
meaning white people as opposed to
carpet-baggers, they will support him
for the third or an, numnber of terms.
The North has given hinm to us
twice Va a President, and it would
not be strange ifttho South, believing
that he is a bettor man than she is
likely to get in a new deal, concludes
to keep: him. We think we are with
in bounds when we say that if Gen.
Grant were to lift, from us the hideous
incubus of usurpation which he was
instrumental in placing upon us, and
I would indicate a willingness to co
i eperate with the people of the State
lie might court Louisiana for him
self in the next election, sans any
kind oftdoubt.-N. 0. Bulletin.
Louisiana is in a condition to move
herself into any position.: The pre
servatin of the material interest of!
her people, have rendered her plastic
in National political affuirs, and the'
hand that would shape hierto success
for her true citizens' benefit, will have
the undivided support of her people.
We say also, if Gen'l. GratIt were to
lift the pall of carpet-bag, scalawag
and negro government from us, he
can count our State for him in the
next election and we would be willing
nihd arelanxious to make the tenure
of office of the next President "during
good behavior," to say the least.
Why not Grant if he should befriend
us.

Morn TESTIMONY WPANTED'.-In the
House of Representatives, on the 20th
Mr. Lamar, from the Commnnittee on
Elections, reported the following pre
amble and resolution, which were
rend, considered and adopted :
Whereas, It is necessary to a pro
per determinattion of the several con
tests fromnt the congressional districts
of Louisiana, now pending in thej
ohouse, that the Committee on Elec.
tion returns of the general election
held in that State on the thurth day
of November, 1872 ; and whereas,
these returns are said to be in the!
possession of John Mcenery, and said
McEnery being unwilling to produce
said returns except upon order of said
committee; therefore,
Be it resolved by this IHlouse, That
a subpenmsduces tecum be issued to said
McEnuery, requiring him to produce
in person before said committee said
election returns on or before the first I
Monday in December, 1874; and also I
-that spbenas be issued to Archibald i
Mlitchell. and William Woelper, of E
New Orleans, requiring thenm to be 1
and appear before said Committee on I
Elections on the first Monday in De- i
cember, A. D. 1874.
W\e take thie above extract from the I
New Orleans Republican. We believe, I
we can state, on good authority, that
the returnes called for in the resolu
tion of the.House, can be produced,
by Gov. McEnery, with esubstantital I
proof that they are the identical re
turns made of the election of 1872,
without change, mutilation, blur or
blemish. 'That this testimony is'
wranted by the House, is a gratifying
fact; that it will be forth-coming, is
certain;-that it is nnimpeaehable
tihe last will and testament of the peo
ple, which Congress is bound ultima
tely to respect-we have no doubt.
The following is a simple mode of
rendering water almost as cold as ice: "
"Let tlheja5 pitcher, or vessel used I
for water be surrounded with one or
more folds of coarse cotton kept con- I
stantly wet. The evaporation of the
water will carry offthe heat from the I
inside and reduce it to a freezing '
point. In India and other tropical ,
regions whlere ice cannot be procured
this is common.
ETERNITr.- Eterit is a solemnt I
word and a solemn world. The soul
of man shrinks back with dismay and
dread from entering that mnysterious
abode of spirits. And yet all are on
their way to eternity, and must soon
enter it, Bad enter it alone. But how t
little think the gay and pleasure-lov
ing, who tread so near its dark shores,
how soon they mnust launch away on
that untried n,tal ,
ito The Wite Majority.
i The Ralicral journals and orators
lie have so persistently asset ted that the
a' whites were iii a mninority in this State
e;, that, strange as it may appear, very
of many of our ,own people have conie to
regard it as the truth, despite tre
tactt that the United States census of
1870, shows conclusively, that not
only 'e the whire males in excess of
the negro and mulatto males, but that I
the white voting males are also in ;
the majority.
It is time that this Radical false
hood were contradicted and disprVredd
by every journal in the State, and r
our stump speakers throughout the i
State should not fail to imipress ifpoit
St their hearers the fact that thathere are
I even according to a ceunsus which was
taken in the heat of the sumnner,
W when there were thousands of white
a oters absent from the State--1i5
more white males over '21 years old,
than black and mulatto males of that
age combined; and, further, that !
- there are 4.300 more white males than
black and mulatto males combined.
'o We think a fair estimate would
n give the whites in this State nearly
if not quite eight thousandL m;ajoriity.
Tbi This a very important fact, and
one that has not been sufficiently
9 kept before the people of the State
Sand country, vwho have, in many
Scases, accepted the unsupported state
ments of Radicals, which are flatly
,contradicted by the census rolls of
'the United States. The theory that
our enemies seem to have acted upon
d is that "a lie, well stuck to, is nearly
as good as the truth," and, really, this
lie has traveled so fast and so far,
' that it will be a very diflicult matter t
y for the truth to overtake it
The Bulletin would esteem it a spe
e cial favor if all journals throughout t
,. the country favorable to the cause of
,f! truth, and who sympathize with Louis
iana in the troubles which have be
c fallen her, will direct attention to
e these important facts.
e A TRUE PROPHET.--Not long ago a
s* fellow, appatently in a state of great t
o excitement, rushed into a saloon in '
g this city, and, throwinghis hat on the
bar, he cried to the barkeeper: "Give
me a drink, Dan, quick! There'll be
e the biggest row you ever saw in
g about two minutes!" Dan set out
ethe whisky bottle, and, wh'le the
stranger nervously filled his glass iup
g to the brim and drank it off at a swal
t. low, tightened hli belt and looked at
d the chambers of his revolver. Leav
ing his hat where it was thrown, the
excited stranger hurriedly ran to the r
door, looked out a moment, and then
e rushed back to the bar and exclaim.
i ed : "Yes, in less than half a ninute
n there'll be ai awful time here! Give a
Sme another drink, quick !" The hot-a
e tle was again passed out, another i
glass was drained, and the stranger t
had picked up his hat, and was lei- f
surely walking away, when the bar
. keeper called after himn: "Say, look
e' here! What's all this about a row t s
- You jest come backi here and pay for a
° those drinks or I'll let daylight into h
Iyour hide!" At this the stranger t'
i turned about, Jtis excitement eatirely a
e gone and coolly said: "There you II
Sgo! Didn't I say there'4 be a fearful
Srow here in a mlnute? I knew it.
Thete yon go, just as I expected." a

SThere is a story of a traveler, who, h

Sgot tutned round and was trotting ti
very otomposedly in the oppqosite di- 1

A Cr-a. f'ot CORNs. --A French
medical journal reports the cure of
the most refractory corns by thl
morning and evening applicatints,
with a brush, of a drop of a solution
of the perchloride of iron. It states
that after a fortnight's continued ap.
plication, without pain, a patient
who had nfltered martyrdom for near
ly forty years from a most painful
corn on the inner sidd, of each little
toe was eptirely relieved; pressure
was no longer painful, and the care
soemeil to be radi'al. ,Other and
similar cases are reported as equally
successful under the treatmlent.
SHAIE TrEEs.--lt is a great mis
take to permit shade trees to stand so
near together that none have roosm
for proper development. Young trees
may be placed near each other to pre
vent awkward gaps, but as they in
crease in size, the suaperfluous ones
should be removed, and the remain
ing ones will show they are the gain
ers. A celebrated fruit grower said
it took him thirty years to acquire
the moral courage necessary to thin
out his fruit buds properly. A still
higher degree of courage is required
to lay the ax to a thrifty, handsome
shade tree, though we know its
neighbors will le dwarfed if it is a!
lowed to remain.
Coruc Ix SwInE.---A Hamilton
county (Iowa) correspondent of the
Rural World says : "If the shoats are
doing well, and the hair or bristles do
not lie smoothly-the shoats having
been fed principally on corn, and
they go coughing around-we come
to the conclusion that they have got
worms, and a teaspoonful of turpea
tine is then given to each, in the
form of a drench. If the coughing
does not cease in the course of a
week, give another spoonful; usual
ly the first dose will be sufficient. If
hogs are fed plenty of salt and ashes,
the worqs hardly ever get the ad
vantage of them. Snlpher and stone
coal and charcoal are good preven
tives of diseases in swine. Hogs are
very fond of charcoal, and also of
salt.
IIARD SoAP.--One 25 cent box of
concentrated lye dissolved in * gal
lon of rain water; pour in a vessel
to cool; melt 5 pounds clean lard or
tallow; when milk-warm pour in
your lye, very slowly, and stir rap
idly; continuo stirring notil it begins
to thicken; add any perfume desired;
have ready a clean box a foot square;
pour in and cover air tight; let it re
main three or four days,' then eat up
in cakes.-Country Gentleman.
To disperse freckles, take I ounce
of lemon juicb, } drachm of sugar;
mix and .let them stand a few days
in a glass bottle till the liquor is fit
for use, then rub it on the hands and
face occasionally.
Fumigating poultry houses with
sulphur, thrown on glowing coals in
an earthen vessel, and keeping the
house close4for several hours, is said
to be a perfect remedy for insects of
all kinds. The poultry must be re
moved before the experiment.
CRACKED SToES.--Don't let youn
stove smoke, merely because there is
a crack in it; but take common wood
ashes and salt, make a paste with a
little water, appliy it to the apperture
and the crack will be closed in a mo.
ment. It can be put on when the
stovre is hot, as emsily as when it is
cold.
Ocfe glER PCiKLES.-First get a
good kind of euumber, then proceed
as follows: Be careful in picking not
to bruise them; wash them clean;
pack themn in stone jars, as they are
far the best, with 1 quart of salt to
every pebek of pickles, and 1* gallons
of water to every 5 gallons of pickles;
also, a lump of alum as large as a
hen's egg to every 5 gallons of pickles.
When your jar is full put a clean flan
nel cloth over them, with a weight
heavy emough to keep them under
the krine, and keep the cloth clean
andl free fronm mold. Now, in seeking
themn for use, the quicker it is done
the better your picklesl will be. When
freshealng,keep, plenty of fresh wa
ter on them. Now scald in a bras. or
copper kettle, using weak vinegar for
the purpose, and about enough to
cover your pickles, adding a lumnp of
alum as lnrge as a quail's egg to every
gallon of pickles. iScald slowly until
they get scalding hot, but do not let
them boil; take them out and lay
them in a stone jar, using cinnamon
or cloves to suit the taste. 8pread 1
large coffee-cup of sugar to 1 gallon
of pickles, over them; then pour
vinegar (not too strong) over them.
This vinegar will do tor use again.
If made in this way will keep for
months, and be as plump and sweet
as the day they were put up. Your
vinegar should not be too strong, as
that would make them sour and desa -
troy the taste of the sugar.
Mist SAvce.-Take a bunch of
green mint and chop it fine with a
knife, or rmb it in a mortar; add lbh.
of fine sugar and * pint of sharp vince
gar. Stir or rub well, and srrve eold.
