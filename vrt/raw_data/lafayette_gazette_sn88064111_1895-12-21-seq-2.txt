Senator Caffery Tuesday last in- d
troduced a resolution in the Senate, t,
-the effect of which will be to ascer- a
exactly where the responsibility re
rests for the failure to pay the
bounty which is due the sugar pro- ,
ducers, and which was voted by the
Slast Congress. The resolution calls
on the president to furnish Congress .
with reasons for :he suspension of
the bounty payments, and it now p
remains to be seen what the presi
dent will do with the resolution v
when it reaches him. It is quite tl
probable, however, thiat he will re- E

S~'y general approval of ;'he peo
a ple as regards the action of
. the regularly constituted party au
thorities. As will be seen by the
official returns published in another
be column a total of some x2oo votes
was cast and a full ticket for dis
sZ trict, parochial and ward officers
nominated. A full set of delekates
was also nominated to the State
Nominating Cotivention and ten
n- members to constitute the next Par
ish Democratic Executive Commit
ri- tee.
The Democrats of the parish are
to be congratulated upon the
thorough party discipline mani
th fested by the returns, and should
feel proud that all political differ
et ences and aspirations may. be set
tled honorably and decently within
party ranks by means of" the pri
mary. Democratic ascendancy is
of synonymous with white supremacy,
ih and that white supremacy is essen
tial to the peace and prosperity of
our country needs but a slight re
trospect for confirmation. Party
organization has placed the State
upon the high road of prosperity,
and the Democrats of Lafayette
may well boast of the beneficent re
sults attained in local matters
through the same agency. Let our
good people stand together and se
cure the election of the regular
Democratic nominees next April.
Let no personal difference or prej u
dice cause any Democrat to hesitate
in the discharge of an honorable
and patriotic duty. Every nominee
has been fairly and honestly selected
and is entitled to the active support
of every true Democrat. The ticket
claims recognition not only by par
ty sanction and endorsement, but
stands forth upon its personal merit.
The nominees are all men of known
probity and integrity and justly
command the respect of the com
munity.
If there are those in our parish
who entertain false hopes of defeat
I ing the will of the party as expressed
last Saturday, let them beware that
in so doing they weaken their cause
and are doomed to certain and dis
astrous failure. In the aspiration
t for office let no true Democrat
place himself without the pale of
party ranks and endeavor by unholy
alliances to gratify selfish ambition,
but let him stand shoulder to
shoulder in the rank and file
and render sincere and hearty sup
port to the ticket. When a major
ity of Democratic voters of this
parish shall reverse the present po
litical status the Gaztte.,"- as` it"
does now, urge loyal acquiescence
in the will of the majority.
In conclusion, let it be said that
the white Democrats of this parish
are competent to run their own af
fairs, and by the grace - of God are
fully determined to continue in the
business yet a little while.
TIE VENEZUELANV CON
TRO VERSY.
The official reply of the British
government in the Venezuelan boun
dary dispute has been transmitted
to Congress by President Cleveland,
and although John Bull refuses to
recognize the Monroe doctrine, the
president in a bold and patriotic
message declares its maintenance
essential to the safety and perpet
uity of our national existence. In
concluding a very terse and forcible
presentation of the question, the
president says:
I am nevertheless firm in my con
viction that while it is a greivous
thing to contemplate the two great
English-speaking peoples of the
world as being otherwise than
friendly competitors in the onward
march of civilization and strenuous
and worthy rivals in all the arts of
peace, there is no calamity which a
great nation can invite which equals
that which follows a supine submis
sion to wrong and injustice and the
consequent loss of national self-re
spect and honor beneath which is
shielded and defended a people's
safety and greatness.
The enunciations of the president
on the subject was greeted by Con
vress with strong demonstrationl of
approval.
A good way to make the revenues
of the government ample to meet all
expenses would be to levy a slight
tariff on tea and coffee and increase
the duties on sugar. The duties on 1
the two former would be exclusively
revenue duties and on the latter
chiefly so.-Commercial Appeal.

!n gifted with the natural appreciation

re man is dead-that his noble voice

i_ bers of the Senate, in the cause of
d freedom, no more in the supreme
councils of the nation with. tones ut
r- tered to but one unvarying patriotic
t- chord of honof, dignity, wisdom
in and manly truth? Let the South
i- be the first to say that Allen Gran
is bury Thurman was a noble man
not of such noblemen as are bred of
so-called old-world patrician fami
i- lies of blood, lust and ambitious
,f guilt, but of such people as honor
able freemen most delight to honor,
and, by so honoring, do themselves
great honor and make noble profit
.e able example for their successors in
r, the righteous upholding of this great
:e Republic of the West and of the
. larger principles of right to all the
world wherever honor may be de
served and wrong justly treated
r with contumely.
The *South has no':quarrel now
r with the record of All-n G. Thur
man. Had all her foes been as
she knew him to be, much bitterness
would have been eliminated from
e the final draught, shoved down her
e throat by mercenary swords and
e much unregenerated rancor and am
I bition. Thurman in all his public
battles had no rancor, and was
more generous to a beaten cause
t than many of the South's bitterest
- persecutors could ever affect to lie 1
t by make-believe speeches and ac
tions,, .the accentuated politeness,
studied differences and badly-con
I cealed, grasping, retaliatory de
' mands of which were almost more
bitter than gall and wormwood to
those who by the final arbitrament t
· of arms had perforce to accept them
for exactly what they were worth,
no more, no less.' In Thurman the
1 South recognized an honest man I
t even in the dazlest days. When the
days grew brighter the South had
by no means the slightest reasonable
cause to feel embittered by the "Old '
Roman's" pub ic policy. If he was a
t an enemy in the dark days he was e
f at least an honorale one, and when r
the war was over he proved himself t
to be. a man with a generous soul,
untouched and unimbruted by either
lust of conquest or personal aiubi- I
tion.
It is for noble reasons/like these
that the South can to-day mourn
with the immjediate mourners of Al
e len G.,- Thurman. For years to
clce-q'lis lingering shade will sug- F
gest feelings rather of sorrow th'an t
of anger in the South. Had he
been a Southern-born man the same
noble qualities and splendid natural a
gifts which he possessed would have
wrung admiration even from those
-who felt themselves to be at open
emity towards him and the cause he S
espoused. He, at least, was one of ii
the foes of whose honest sincerity d
there could be no just impeachment, b
either by friends or foes. He felt n
himself to be pursuing the right C
rather than the expedient, and in p
that position the South, in its hours ti
of travail, was well content to honor n
him. t;
To-day the South- had: no cause n
whatever to alter its d'emeanor to- g
wards the memory of Allen G. Thur- a
man. We are all now members of I
the United States family, working ii
with but one aim and feeling for the g
benefit of the whole household, and n
ready to league as one man against d
a common foe-standing, like a
tooter, four-square to every wind c
that blows; and being thoroughly ci
conscious of this grand fact, the ri
South can feel that it is only doing
itself an honor in approaching with p
bowed head the tomb that now is a
about to receive the remains of Al
len Granbury Thurman and hoping
that the world will always produce
foes as chivalrous and honest and
able as he was Dy voice and action. si
We deplore the death of Allen G. i
Thurman, not only because he was t
an able man, but because he was,
like another Caesar, much-be
mourned by Brutus, an honorable
man, in whom the elements were so
mixed that all the world might say, ti
as well as the United States, the P
common heritage: "Take him all an
in all, he was an honorable man." u

large mass meeting held in that par

Christmas is coming. The jol

events casts its brightness before.
All the little folks are on the tiptoe
of expectancy-the old folks are
conferring secretly and wear mys

aright portend a jolly time for all
true votaries of Santa Claus, the
jingle of whose sleigh bells are even
now heard in the distance. The
children rejoice in anticipation of
gifts and those who are older, in
the pleasure they may confer on
others. The season is one peculiar
ly appropriate for gifts and deeds
of charity, and this phase of the
celebration deserves especial con
sideration, for "It is better to give
than to receive."
