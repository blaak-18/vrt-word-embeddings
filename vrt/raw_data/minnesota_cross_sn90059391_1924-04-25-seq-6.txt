BARON MATSUI IN
LONG STATEMENT
Tokyo.—The gravity of the situation
arising out of the decision of the
United States house of representatives
in regard to the exclusion of Japanese
Immigrants Is clearly reflected In a
long statement Issued by Huron Mat*
sui, the foreign minister, to American
Journalists.
Mutsul states, In effect, that the ex
clusion proposal coming aft£r pro
tracted efforts to develop friendship
with the United States, Is a source of
grave anxiety, anil It “seems to us we
are appealing against un actioii that
cnn only wound us and can bring little
satisfaction to you,” and “we desire
a provision by the United States for
the operation of the gentlemen's agree
ment.”
The United States, he said, is In a
position either to take arbitrary ac
tion or to behave with One magnanim
ity, setting an example to other na
tions or inducing their resentment.
Matsul concludes by saying: “If now
we get from you an experience of a
different ghuracter it will undo some
of that spirit of friendship and esteem
In which we have long been happy to
regard you. With a nation of the
character of yours, regard for others
Is, we believe, a consideration of no
mean importance.”
Unemployment Is Now

no unemployment In the United States.
Building activity, be said, has ab

tions. This also Is being offset by a
revival In building operations.

HIGH-GRADE HOME TOWN
Te Secure Fine Qualttlee In a Com
munity Something See I dee
Money la Needed.
The greet trouble with American
life today is the tendency te see ev
erything from a money point of view.
People are forever asking with regard
te every choice In life, “Will It pey f
They Judge education and occupation
and marriage and all ether relations
by the money point of view. But there
Is a side of Ufa still that Is te seme
extent and In some minds free from
this sordid standard. There Is a group
of things to which we give the name
of home. There are values In one’s
heme that cannot he measured by the
mere coarse yardstick of money, do
people will often sacrifice money re
wards In order te retain the home as
sociations that they prize.
The question of developing what Is
called a good residential town depends
In a large measure on the acquirement
of this point of view. You can’t have
a good home town If you ask In re
gard to everything you do, If It will
pay In terms of money.
if the object for Improving a home
or a street or a neighborhood Is pure
ly to make money, a lot of folks will
never co-operate In such efforts. If
the only motive for planting fine trees
and shrubbery is that they make a
residence sell for more, a lot of peo
ple will never do It In all probabil
ity such efforts to beautify a place
do pny In cash, but that motive alene
Is not sufficient.
To secure these fine qualities that
constitute a high-grade home town,
something besides money ambition has
to be devoted to this purpose. Peo
ple must feel a love for their commun
ity, an attachment to that spot that
they call home. There must be a kind
of affection for the scene, a desire to
nurse It and make It as lovable and
romantic and beautiful as possible.
Somehow civic beauty seems to have
Its effect on the character of the peo
ple of a town. “If you have a dull
and drab looking town, you will draw
dull and drab people,” said a lecturer
on civic topics.—Salem News.
PAINT ADDS VALUE TO HOUSE
Ragged-Looking Buildings on Farm
Makes Place Look Run Down
and Reduces Its Value.
The man who cares about the ap
pearance of his farm buildings will
be a liberal user of paint. Palntleas
buildings make a farm look ragged
and run down. If a man goes out to
buy such a place, he turns It down be
cause of the leeks of the buildings.
He thinks the land Is poor or the farm
er would show prosperity by toning
up the buildings about the place with
paint.
The neighbors who pass will say that
surely the man Is making a failure or
he would not neglect his house and
barn as he does. So, If the farmer
thinks anything of how his buildings
look to the other fellow he will keep
them painted nicely.
Then paint saves the farmer money
In preserving the life of the material
In the buildings. Unpainted buildings
In most any climate soon show evi
dence of decay. In a short time re
pairs must be made at considerable
expense. The cost of such repairs will
pay for the paint that should have
been used long ago. Some farmers
make It a point to put a coat of paint
on their buildings every three or four
years. In other words, they keep their
buildings looking like new most of
the time. You could visit such places
any time In the year, and you would
not find the least sign of paint falling
away.
At painting Is so important the qual
Ity of the pnlnt used Is worthy of con
sideration. Most all the cheap paints
are adulterated, and It will hardly pay
one to purchase them. Only the best
brands of paint should be purchased
although the price Is higher. When
It Is applied It will not blister and
peel off.
Towns Made by Railroads.
The new railway grouping system
might presumably have a disastrous
effect on certain towns.
If for lnstunce, the London, Midland
A Scottish railway were to decide to
make Derby their sole center for ma
chine shops, Crewe and Horwldi, and
to some extent Manchester and Glas
gow, would suffer. The two former
would, In fact, find their occupation
gone.
But it is possible that no town would
suffer to such a greater extent, if it
were superseded. as Swlndown.
Almost every able-bodied man In the
town Is engaged In some form of rail
way work. —London Tlt-Blts.
Home le Man's Shrine.
There Is no sentiment so common

ST. PAUL MOTHERS
REGULATE ‘CRUSHES’
Parents Draw I p Code of Rules
Aimed at Younger Set’s
“Steadies”
Half a dozen “crushes” may be all
right, but just one is one too many,
St. Paul mothers have decided in
drawing up terms of an armistice to
be offered to their sons and daugh
ters.
It was decided at a meeting at the
home of Mrs. Charles Weyerhaeuser
that a code of rules should be drawn
up that would be broad and reason
able enough to satisfy the flapper,
and strong enough to win the moth
er’s endorsement. An organization
was formed, with Mrs. William J.
Dean as president, and Miss Sarah
Converse as vice president and Mrs.
James C. Otis as secretary.
Suggested rules include:
Changing partners between dances.
A request by the hostess that boys
refrain from smoking at her parties,
as an example to the younger mem
bers of the set.
Closing hours for entertainments—
-11 p. m. for freshmen, and midnight
for seniors.
Giving the “young male flapper” a
sense of responsibility by expecting
him to help entertain guests instead
of simply sitting back to be admired.
Watching of “movies” by parents,
getting together a list of suitable
ones and not broadcasting the others.
Anyway, the parents are going to
try it out and see how it works.
The Lost Stanzas
of “America”
I _
Our national song. “America.” was
first publicly sung July 4, 1832, at
Park Street church. Boston, and orig
inally there were eight stanzas, four
that have become familiar to all and
four that for some reason have been
neglected. These four stanzas are
presented as follows:
Our glorious land today,
’Neath education’s sway,
Soars upward still,
Its halls of learning fair,
Whose bounties all may share,
Behold them everywhere,
On vale and hill.
They safeguard liberty.
The school shall ever be
Our nation’s pride;
No tyrant hand shall smite,
While with encircling light
All here are taught the right,
With truth allied.
’Neath Heaven’s gracious will
The stars of progress still
Our course do sway;
In unity sublime
To broader heights we climb.
Triumphant over Time.
God speeds our way.
Grand birthright of our sirea,
Our altar and our fires
Keep we still pure!
Our starry flag unfurled.
The hope of all the world,
In peace and light impearled,
God held secure.
Just why these four stanzas have
been lost all these years is something
which no one seems to be able to ex
plain. The Enterprise is publishing
them so that our readers may clip
them and paste them in their song
books, so that they may be sung if
so desired. —Hennepin (Minn.) Coun

CHURCH URGED TO
OUTLAW ALL WAR
Resolution Will Be Presented to
Presbyterian Assembly
in May
MADISON, WIS., April 12. -A reso
lution against all war has been pre
pared by pastors here for presenta
tion to the general assembly of the
church at Grand Rapids, Michigan,
Slay 15.
“The church cannot justify any
Earticipation in war on the part of
er various organizations or members,
or justify the use of her pulpits,
presses and buildings for war propa
ganda,” a part of the proposed reso
lution says.
Eleven members of the Madison
presbytery, covering a considerable
portion of the state, signed the pro
posed edict. They argue that since
war is morally wrong, it cannot be
justified by the church on any pre
text.
“Many of the men in our churches
who loyally supported the last war
and have come to see the fearful
devastation of that war, the millions
killed and mutilated, and the era of
reckless extravagance and debauch
ery, have now come to such a changed
mind they are ready to take a person
al stand against war,” the resolution
says. “The time has come for the
whole church to do likewise.
“Whatever useful purpose war may
have served in the past in establish
ing freedom and overthrowing wrong,
the character of war has been
changed by modern conditions. It
now becomes an agency of disintegra
tion so terrible that it has ceased to
be of any use and, if continued will
mean the end of civilization.
“War is no longer a combat be
tween armies of professional soldiers
under careful rules, but is rather a
grim life and death struggle between
whole peoples, wherein little chil
dren, women and the aged are no
longer exempt. All the chciished
material and cultural resources of
civilization are mobilized and devas
tated.”
In addition to outlawing war on
the part of Presbyterians, the church
men propose to “direct educational
agencies of the church to prepare lit
erature and set apart at least one day
a year for definite instruction of
children and all members in accord
ance with this declaration.”
Efforts will be made also to get
other denominations of the Protest
ant church to adopt similar edicts,
the Wisconsin ministers announce.

The ‘Big Brother’Movement
(Prom Christian Science Monitor)
An occasional inconspicuous item
in a newspaper tells of the interest
manifested in some community in the
“Big Brother” movement, which
means the pledging, quite informal
ly, of a number of men, young or old,
each to take a friendly but unofficial
Eart in reclaiming or restoring some
oy whose home training and sur
roundings have not given him a prop
er start. A recent item from Min
neapolis, Minn., told of the enlist
ment of 185 active "Big Brothers” in
that city. Perhaps the number, while
comparatively large, should have been
many times greater. The secretary
of the Minneapolis branch of the or
ganization is authority for the state
ment that 80 per cent of the boys
who come in contact with the broth
erhood’s activities are what are re
ferred to as predelinquent.
One could hardly imagine a richer
field for properly directed brotherly
effort. In every citv of the world
there are, no doubt, hundreds or
thousands of these unfortunate boys
whose activities and ambitions need
wise direction. They need someone
to whom they can give their confi-
Deh&te on the immigration bill was

Senator Simmons, North Carolina, un
dor preference, as immigrants would be
given farmers whenever a state certified
its lack of that form of labor. Visa
certiftcatea could then be issued to
farmers up to 2o j*?r cent of the quota
allowed to any foreign country.
A proposal by Senator Willis. Ohio,
to extend the quota limitation to all
countries in continental North and
South America was opposed by Sena >rs
regardless of party, on the ground that
it was in violation of the national “pan-
American policy.” and it was rejected
hy a vote of 59 to 12.
Senator Curtis. Kansas, called up the
soldier bonus bill and had it made the
unfinished business.
A house measure proposing American
participation in an international con
ference for suppression of habit-form
ing drugs was approved by the foreign
relations committee.
A resolution by Senator McKinley. Il
linois. proposing an invitation to the
International Parliamentary union to
meet in Washington next year, was or
dered favorably reported by the foreign
relations committee.
The foreign relations committee des
ignated a subcommittee of five, headed
by Senator Pepper, Pennsylvania. to
conduct hearings and report on the pro
posal for United States participation in
the world court.
Five witnesses were heard by the oil
investigating committee In an effort to

publican national convention of 1920.

away their fears and remove the be
lief in limitations due to heredity or
environment. One hundred and
eighty-five men can do much in *•
city like Minneapolis, but two or
three times the number of men, prop
erly equipped, could do more.
That more men are not active te
such work as this is due, no doubt,
to the fact that many men who are
fitted for such activity do not real
ize that fact, and that they do Ml
appreciate the need. Nothing, in tike
language of the busineee man, pays *
greater dividend. There is a qufefc
responsiveness in the conacioasneae
of a boy, even if that bov is a delin
quent. There is a thin but not ixn-
Eervious armor which must be pierced,
ut the process is not difficult. The
right man can obtain the boy’s con
fidence quickly. He can lose it juet
as.quickly. But failure should not
be suggested. The delinquent boy fen
often condemned because of no in
herent fault. He has erred, perhape,
because he has sought activity along
the only line which seems to him te
be open.
The dividends promised will not
materialise in the form of dollar*-
in the pockets of the “Big Brothers.*'
That is not the promise. Bat cm
anyone imagine greater satisfaction
than that realized in the knowledge
that one young boy has been re
deemed from moral delinquency and
made a self-respecting and law-abid
ing member of society by the timely
extending of brotherly help? Love
has unnumbered ways in which to re
claim and restore the fallen. Perhape
it finds its fullest exemplification he

state department of education, with
the cooperation of the United States
bureau of education, is making •
study of high schools in two coun

it is expected to develop a poliev fa

larger and better schools, in the opin
