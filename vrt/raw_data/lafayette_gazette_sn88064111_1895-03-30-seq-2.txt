SUBJECT TO PAIS.f 24X.4- qu
TIO2V. Pc
Last Monday the Supreme Court fri
decided the case of the Parish of inj
Lafayette and I. A. Broussard, Tax- sh
Collector, against Numa Shayot, for wl
a license claimed for business car- tri
ried on by the latter in what is pc
known as the McComb's Additiop Inu
of the town of Lafayette. As this z8
case involves questions of great im- ba
portance to the parish as well as to lie
the town we will give its history: ag
In the year 1884 the Town Coun- be
cil called an election at which was cc
submitted certain amendments to of
the charter of the town. Among
the number was one taking in its
corporate limits all the adjacent st,
territory known as the Mills, Mc
Comb and Mouton Additions.
These amendments were adopted fl
by the popular vote, and were so
declared by the proclamation of the w
mayor.
Some time later, during 1884,
the question was raised between the
town and parish as to whom licenses
due by persons doing business in le
the additions were to he paid. The d
Police Jury appointed a committee b
to confer with a like committeeb
from the Town Council. This n
committee reported to the Police t
Jury that the licenses were due to
the corporation and the report was
adopted by that body. k
In 1889 the Police Jury appointed c
by Gov. Nicholls after the election
of 1888 passed a resolution in its s
license ordinance instructing the v
e Sheriff to collect licenses from all n
persons engaged in business in the
e additions. The sheriff made de
it mand but all refused to pay. Again d
. in 189x, 1892 and 1893, the Police e
; Jury gave the same instructions to V
is the sheriff, and again upon demand
is they refused to pay the licenses.
i- The Police Jury then instituted the
n suit against Numa Schayot for the
d license of 1893. The defendant i
nr contended that as the old town of
,r Vermilionville was exempt from
n parish taxation by its charter, the
;e new territory annexed in 1884 was
Ly also exempt; further, that having
Is agreed to the exemption and hav
is ing relinquished or abandoned its
'e right to tax, the parish could not
rr now claim it. It was bound by the
report of the committe of 1884,
. approved by the then Police Jury.
A The Supreme Court decided that
n the Town Council had no right or
st power, under the law, to take in
any new territory and that the par
l ish could not relinquish the powers
of entrusted to it. Hence the decision
is means that the parish licenses
le claimed were legal and constitu
to tional.
is It is to be regretted that the pro
st ceedings of the Town Council were
not carried out according to law, or
m if no law authorized the annexation
y of new territory, it is unfortunate
a- that it was ever, undertaken. It
in now places the inhabitants of the
1e additions in an anom ous predica
of ment. They invested in those lo
k- calities believing them to be a part
th of a duly organized muÂºricipal cor
a- poration, with all the advantages
flowing therefrom, but they may
now exclaim with the celebrated
statesman from Georgia, "Where are
wd e at?"
e- We are not a lawyer and do not
know what will be the effects of the
decision on the additions, and we
presume that many others and even
t some among the legal fraternity,
are in the same fix. 'Tis a rather
w knotty question to say the least.
t- But be this as it may, the error of
ck x884 seems to carry serious hard
Sships on these people.
But this is not the only side of
vn this question. Since x890o the Po
n lice Jury gave notice that it in
:ed tended to exercise its power of tax
he ing the people of the additions.
he Representing the people of the par
st ish it considered itself in duty
in bound to collect taxes from all per
ill sons subject to its jurisdiction
e- withoutregard to individuals or local
'w ities. By abstaining from, or fail
his ing to, collect taxes from certain lo
calities, the burden of defraying
u- the expenses of the parish fell more
th heavily on the others. This is
heL quite an item when the amount
which the parish would have col
ist lected during the last ten years in
en licenses aud taxes from the addi
he ditions is considered.* The parish
er tax of ten mills could, with this
amount, have been lowered con
in silerablv. As sworn servants of
Ily the peoplel they have placed matters
irs' on a basis of equality, to which no
one should object.
No ow; that the matter is ended in
el- so far as the questions decided go,
all we ovnuld surggest that as the people
the living on the disputed territory have
Sbeen paying their taxes anad licenses
,to tie coryioratior, it would- be hme
quitable and-unjust on the pa:t o C
Police Jury to collect back taxes
from them. It is true, that accord- IE
ing to the Supreme Court they
should have paid them to the parish
when demanded, but it is equally I71
true that they paid them to the cor
poration upon the faith of the reso
lution passed by the Police Jury in Zn
1884. It would be unfair to collect eas
back taxes from them and we be- tior
lieve that all fair-minded people for
agree with us that they should not dec
be made to suffer for the errors Job
