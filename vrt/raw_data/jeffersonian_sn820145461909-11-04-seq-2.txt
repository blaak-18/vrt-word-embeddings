Our Need of Democracy
By Alice Davis.
The government of the United
States is, nominally, a democracy.
To prove that it is not really such
involves no more difficult task than
to define the word. Democracy
means rule of the people. But the
people of the United States do not
rule—only men rule. Now, we are
forced to one of two conclusions:
Either the government of the United
States is not a democracy, or wom
en are not people.
Anthropology seems to support the
view that women are people. In
many places, both in this country
and abroad, the law accords to wom
en the status of people.
Our Federal Constitution, in its
definition of citizenship, is quite gen
erally understood to include women
among people. The civil status of
women in most countries seems to
justify the conclusion that they are
generally regarded as people. Fi
nally, there are four States in our
Federal States which include
women among the political people.
The preponderance of evidence,
therefore, perhaps it will be admit
ted, is in favor of the presumption
that women are people.
Now, as democracy means rule of
the people, and as women are people,
unless women have part in the rule,
the government surely is not demo
cratic.
Class rule is the leading character
istic of any form of despotism, wheth
er it is called monarchy, aristocracy,
oligarchy, or democracy. Theoretic
ally, of course, government exists
for the protection of all the people.
Under despotism of whatever name,
the justification of class rule is based
upon the supposition that the ma
jority is not qualified to govern. If
the supposition is correct, to the ex
tent to which it is true, perhaps a
case may be made out for despotic
rule. That, at least, is a debatable
question.
But for the sake of common hon
esty, it would be better that a gov
ernment by a class did not masquer
ade as a democracy, which exists os
tensibly for the equal protection of
all the people, and in which all the
people must have part.
The founders of the government
the United States recognized as
its basic principle the truth that only
by direct participation in political
affairs can any class or individual
be assured of justice in making and
administering the laws. The recog
nition of this truth is shown by their
insistence upon “no taxation without
representation,” and by the claim
that no one could represent another
unless the one to be represented di
rectly voted for the would-be repre
sentative. Different views between
the colonists and the English govern
ment with reference to these two
principles caused the agitation which
finally resulted in separation, and the
establishment here of a government
purporting to be a democracy.
It is quite true that these princi
ples were not applied to all individ
uals, nor to all classes; but the point

to be emphasized here is, that the
fundamental principles of democra
cy, the direct participation of all the
people in government, was recogniz
ed as an essential of just government.
That is to say, democracy and polit
fcal justice were regarded as syn
onymous.
Furthermore, at the present time,
women form the only class and the
only individuals who do not par
ticipate in political affairs. Why do
women wish a voice in the govern
ment? Simply because they believe,
as their colonial ancestors believed,
that no one is sure of justice unless
that one has in his or her hand the
means of demanding it. If history
“SEPA RA TION”
By L. C. Branyon
Gone from my tree the bird that sang
So close beside my cottage-door;
And silent now the bells that rang
And softly soothed me more and
more.
For she I love’s away!
For me no more the waters laugh,
Whereby w r e wandered hand in
hand;
No joy-cup, now, for me to quaff,
And slow the hourglass pours its
sand,
For she I love’s away!
All withered, now, the roses fall;
The garden of my soul is sere,
For she was flowers, roses—all,
And more than they, when she was
here;
But she I love’s away!
And in this winter-gloom of life,
I find no ingleside to cheer
Tired heart and hands, when ends
the strife
Os labor’s day, for she’s not near—
Away, away, away!
No more our mating hearts can thrill
In rhythmic numbers at the touch
Os passing joy or fancied ill,
And peace, Life gave so overmuch.
For she I love’s away!
No night can be so dark as this;
No day so sunless as is now,
For absent e’er the holy kiss
clearly, forcibly and fully demon
strates any one fact, it is this. The
history of antiquity, of Greece and
Rome, no less than medieval and
modern history, conclusively proves
that those classes which lacked po
litical power received but little con
sideration at the hands of the ruling
classes.
Individual men and women
throughout the ages have deplored
the unjust discrimination against
women. And it is only within com
paratively recent times that large
numbers of both women and men
Have come to realize the serious dis
advantage, as well as the humilia
tion, of woman’s position, and as a
result of this realization have begun
systematically to agitate for their po
litical emancipation.
This is due to two causes. One is
the great industrial development of
the last two centuries, and the other
is the progress of democracy.
Since the industrial revolution
women have come in competition
with men in practically all the in-
Xsb«- Jeffersonian
dustries. They have not usurped
men’s place, as some narrow-visioned
people imagine, for there is no means
of determining men’s place or wom
en’s either. Women have simply,
through the work of events, been
forced into the larger field.
Now, inasmuch as they have no
direct representation in the lawmak
ing bodies, they, of course, are pow
erless to effect legislation which reg
ulates their hours of labor, and the
conditions under which they work.
Their wages, too, are often unques
tionably lower because they are not
political factors. Woman’s position,
then, it is seen, is quite anomolous.
She bears all the burdens and re-
This angel pressed upon my brow;
Since she I love’s away!
Deep sorrow drowns the springs of
hope
And spectral Furies throng my
way,
While Time unwinds an endless rope,
And sweeps me on and will not
stay.
For she’s away, away!
Each ear that heard her gentle step,
Each heart that gladdened at her
smile,
But brighter woke and sweeter slept
With dreams and love of her the
while.
But, oh! that she’s away!
Ah! she’s away! Silent as the flight
Os sea-gull or the shooting star,
She vanished from my tearful sight.
I stand beside the moaning bar,
And dream of her away!
But in this midnight of the soul,
Abysmal chaos of the mind,
Her wraith-like form in saints’ pure
stole,
From every ill my life shall bind,
Though she be far away.
So in this sorrow w r ill I dwell,
And live, and hope, and deem it
true,
That separation’s not farewell,
Although I whisper, now, “Adieu”,
While she I love’s away!
sponsibilities incident to her place
as an industrial worker and contrib
utes to the support of the political
government, in which she has no
voice, and by which she may be, and
actually is, oppressed. That is to
say, she is compelled to contribute
to her own oppression.
Under a nominal despotism there
is not so much difference between
the position of men and women out
side of the ruling classes, and women
are relatively better off under such
a government than under a nominal
democracy as ours; for under a des
potism there is one despot or a small
class of despots, whereas under a
nominal democracy, all men are
placed in the position of despots;
that is to say, we have a government
theoretically free; in fact, we have
a government based upon men, a
male oligarchy.
The evil effects of this system are
incalculable.
The exclusion of women from par
ticipation in government means that
they are deprived of the most favor-
able conditions for free and natural
development and shut out from the
larger outlook upon life. It means
forced repression in a vital direc
tion, and results in the
stunted, artificial beings, whose en
ergies are wasted upon petty and
trifling concerns.
This means a direct and an in
direct loss to society and the State; -
the direct, through the failure to
utilize woman’s intuitive perception,
her rapid and correct insight into
present fact, and her greater quick
ness of apprehension in social and
political affairs. It means the loss
of half our resources.
In all things "of difficulty and im
portance those who can do them well
are fewer than we need; even with
the most unrestricted latitude of
choice the limitation of the field of
selection deprives society of some
chance of being served by the com
petent without ever saving it from
the incompetent.
The indirect loss comes through
the poorer equipment of those par
ticipating in government through
their training by and association with
imperfectly trained women and men.
Right here it is proper to notice
the much talked of influence of wom
en. No one doubts that women may
and do exercise much influence in
affairs of State. They always have
done so under every form of govern
ment; but under a nominal democ
racy, without the ballot, this influ
ence wholly irresponsible, and ow
ing to that fact, as well as the lack
of .political training, it is quite as
likely to be bad as good.
Why then continue so illogical and
unsatisfactory a procedure, fraught
with injustice to women and loss to
the State?
The political inexpediency of such
a course seems apparent, but the
ethical aspect is still more serious.
To consign one-half of the population
to a position of inferiority, to doom
them to imperfect development and
to exclude them from a share in the
government under which they live,
and whose laws they must obey, and
which they must support—to do all
this upon the basis of sex is nothing
short of criminal stupidity.
It is quite useless and unfair to
make statements about what would
or would not be the effect of wom
en’s voting, except as’the effect is
proved by experience. Fortunately,
we have experience to draw upon.
Woman suffrage has passed'the ex
perimental stage and both, in the
four States in the Federal States
where women have the full suf
frage, and in foreign countries, the
preponderance of evidence testifies
to its satisfactory working, even from
the standpoint of political expedi
ency.
When justice and political expe
diency both demand the enfranchise
ment of women, why should there be
further delay?
