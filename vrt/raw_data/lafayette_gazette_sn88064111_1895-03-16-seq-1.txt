CHASED BY FIRE.
How Two Dakota Young People
Became Engaged.
It was a gloomy day in November.
The wind rushed over a Dakota prairie,
causing the tangled masses of long
grass with which it was carpeted to
wave to and fro like the coming in or
going out of the tide. Everything was
brown and withered, and the sod
houses scattered at wide intervals
fitted well in the somber picture. There
were patches of bare ground here and
there, with piles of dead "tumbling
weeds," broken from their main stem
and clinging together, rolling over
miles of space, the playthings of the
wind, and increasing in size as they
rolled.
A young girl stood in the doorway of
a small dug out, and looked at these
with a troubled countenance.
"It would be a terrible day for a fire,"
she said to the lad who was twi.ting
the bay for their night fuel a few yards
away. "Everything issodry, and those
weeds are collecting in such quantities
that they would be a moving wall of
flame If lighted."
"Well," said the boy hopefully, "it's
getting late in the season for fres, and
Jack Williams plowed a half dozen ex
tra furrows around our house for a
safety line. If the wind keeps on tear
ing like this, we'll get rain or snow
soon, and that will put an end to all
anxiety. Ugh! what's that?"
There was an echo of horse's hoofs
from the rear of the house, and an In
dian came round the corner, mounted
on a white-faced pony, with a blanket
dragging loosely from his shoulders.
The girl stepped back, and the boy
dropped his hay and came near her, as 1
if to offer her some protection.
"White Bear comes!" said the red
man, with a pompous air, laying his
hand upon his chest as he spoke. "Big
Sioux-much big-wants flour, meal,
salt pork!"
For a moment Alice Maxon was
frightened, but a glance at her brother
Elmer seemed to give her strength, and
she answered, firmly: "We have no
food for you, White Bear. The year
has been a hard one for us. See our
little farm, our one cow and horse, and 1
our poor clothes. We are only chil
dren. I am eighteen, and my brother I
is twelve. Our father and mother are
dead, a long, cold winter lies before us,
and we have not a mouthful to spare."
The Indian frowned. t
"White Bear must have flour and a
meat from all the settlers of Ridge
prairie! Does the one cow give milk? t
White bear must have butter. Has the s
maiden chickens? White Bear must n
have eggs. I have said it!" t
"You will get nothing here," said El- f
mer Maxon, angrily. "If you want
these things, do as we have done; work e
for them, like a good citizen of the c
United Statea!" y
"Does the maiden say this, too?"
"I do not like to turn you away u
empty-handed," Alice returned in a gen- d
tle voice, "but I cannot give you from f
our store of provisions. A great war
rior will not be cruel, and if I offer to ii
break bread with you, will not White tV
Bear eat one slice and go in peace?" a
"lNol" growled the savage. "White b
Bear will have what he asks for or tl
nothing! And if I get nothing, the bad h
children will be sorry; they will know a
what it is to be hungry and cold before a
spring!" u
Alice turned away, unable to meetft
the stare of his revengeful eyes; but h
Elmer answered, dauntlessly: "'We are b
not afraid of you, and I don't believe a
you are even a big Sioux. Brave chiefs q
donot beg, or try to scare boys and p
girls, eithert"
"We shall seel" said White Bear, in a IA
guttnaral voice. it
iHe struck his pony with a piece of
shingle thathe held in his left hand, i
and rode away without looking back; f
but Alice and Elmer watched him out tl
of sight with some uneasiness. w
"I am sorry," said the girl, "but in- cl
deed I cannot help it. To give to one to
Indian is tb open the door through fc
which twenty more will file into your T
castle. And we cannot spare aanything f" ,
froal our winter's allowance witho t 1j

"Are you afraid of White Bear?" the fe
boy asked. v
"I am a little troubled by his Sa
threats," said his sister. w
"Well, I believe I. had better gpogp

the pleasantest and most natural thing
in the world."
h. "He is very kind," and Alice Maxon's
face grew still more rosy. !'Perhaps it
would be well to consult him; and you
should lose no time in going, Elmer,
s for you must be back before dark."
Elmer Aid not wait for a second bid
ding, but mounted the only horse they
possessed and rode away towards the
Williams Homestead.
The two builldlng were, in pioneer
phrase, "handy to- Oh- other," being
a only a.mile apa when the boy
reached Jack's he found that
.sturdy. fellow on'hisknees in front of
the cabin, oiling and polishing a bi
cycle with industrious eare.
"Billoa, Elmer!" he called out, cheer

flying trip to your hquso. I-have been
to Sherwood, and as to-morrow hap
pens to be your sister's birthday, I
bought her a little present, and I was
going to bring it over on my wlkeel."
Elmer was alive with interest now,
and White Bear was forgotten till
after Jack had brought from the
kitchen table a handsome plush toilet
case, carefully wrapped in several pa
pers.
"Isn't that a daisy!" the young man
cried, warmly. "I can imagine how
Alice's blue eyes will shine when she
sees it."
"Didn't it cost a mint of money?" the
boy asked reproachfully.
"Only five dollars, Elmer. I will own
that to be a good sum for a Dakota
farmer to spend on a thing of beauty;'
but it is my first gift to your smaster, and
nothing seems too extravagant for
Alice."
Miss Williams, Jack's elder sister and
r housekeeper, looked up from her sew
ing and smiled shrewdly at this trans
l parent speech; but Elmnr saw nothing
significant in it, and went on with his
errand in a rapid way.
Jack's brow clouded in a moment.
"Tle impudent beggar!" he exclaimed
r angrily.
Miss Williams shook her head grave
ly.
"I am afraid he will carry out his
threat. Indians are so vindictive! I
wish Alice would break up housekeep
ing and spend the winter with us."
A cry from Elmer brought the others
quickly to the door. Beyond the dug
out of the Maxons a puff of smoke was
ascending toward the sky, and the
wind was behind it, blowing a gale.
Jack caught the situation in an in
stant.
"Sarah," he cried, excitedly, "White
Bear's work has begun. We are all in
the pathway of that fire, and it will
strike Alice first!"
"lint there is a plowed safety line
about the house," said Miss Williams.
"Of no more value than a tow string
when those masses of burning, tum
bling weeds from Ogden's breaking are
swept along by the wind! Can you and
Elmer set a head fire beyond our house,
and meet this one'with wet brooms and
blankets when it comes, while I go for
Alice on my wheel?"
"Yes," replied the determined wom
an. "We can save this place. I think,
but I do not believe you can bring
Alice on the bicycle."
"Trust me for that!" said Jack,
mounting hurriedly. "She is as light
as a feather, and brave enough to keep
her balance. I can ride ahead of any
ordinary prairie fire, and," he added
under his breath as he spun out over
the trail, "if I cannot save her we can
die together!"
Sarah Williams lost no time in mak
ing those efficient preparations for a
battle with fire that are so familiar
with the western pioneer, and, as Jack
looked back over his shoulder, he saw
the headline of fiery flame rushing
away from his house, and knew that
when the advancing forces came up
theywould find the cool-headed woman
and boy ready to meet them.
Ile could see the blaze rising above I
the smoke behind the Maxon buildings,
and knew it was coming with awful.
speed. A few rods from the door of
the house he met Alice running in
frantic haste. e
"Quick! Quick!" he shouted, as he
circled about and turned to his own
claim. "Come with me an1 I can save a
you-the place must go!"' e
She grasped his strong hand, sprang
up to the support of his arm, and,
doubly freighted, the light, steel ce
forged vehicle started on its return. b
There have been many novel faces a
in the world, but never another like a
this. Love and fear, life and death, 8
courage and calmness were all in the r
balance, and a straw might determine P
the result. Crackling and hissing be- b
hind them was a wall of fire. Clouds b
of thick smoke rushed about them, d
and sickening heat seemed to swallow
up sight and hearing; but still Jack's h
feet steadily guided the pedals, still he n
held the preciouns burden against his h
breast, and on they flew before the f'
winld. Only when he felt his muscles a
quivering under the strain he whis- n
pered hoarsely in the girla ear:
"Alice, I love you! Living or dead, "
we will never be separated!" And Al
ice whispered: "Neveri"
Then with new strength he pumped
on, and found himself on black soil. A a
few revolutions more, and he was in
the midst of his own safety furrows,
with a huge mass of burning weeds
closely pursuing him, which was shat- 0
tored and thrown back by two pitch
forks in the hands of Sarah and Elmer.
Then they all rallied and assailed the d
ftery enmy as it came up in roaring P
lines, beating -it down and giving ex
ulepnt cheers atits sullen death ti

TWFO GOWETB POR THE CHARITY EAI.L.
is wonderfully pretty, though the ex
periment is a peculiar one for hard
times. The costume of this order is of
black crepon, the petticoat lined
throughout with white taffeta. The
bodice has a white silk collar with
crisp little bows of black satin and a
skeleton girdle of jet fits the waist
cozily. The crossbands over the bust
and the black satin cape epaulettes are
of white corded silk worked out with
jet beadings.
Maybe it is allowable to describe a
costume or two prepared for the charity
ball. A pale pink silk made up for one
of *the debutantes has a huge draped
ash of'pink and blue gauze tied in a
great knot behind. The bodice is full,
round and blouselike, draped with
pink gauze and with a full ruche about
the shoulders. The sleeves are short,
but certainly big enough to make a
dress of.
By th h way here's a sleeve story. A
New York woman whose dresses are
models of taste on small money, over
hauled an attic chest the other day and
found a handsome red and black plaided
silk gown that had belonged to her
mother. Tartans are the fashion, and
she pulled it from its resting place
without pause or question.
"Make me a high-necked waist," she
said to her dressmaker, "a fancy blouse,
if you please, with big sleeves for after
noon teas."
The dressmaker considered. Then
without comment she measured. The
skirt Was a full one after the fashion
of forty years ago.
"It won't cut the sleeves," was her
verdict, "and where'd be the use if it
did; there'd not be a scrap of a waist to
put them to?"
"Then cut me an eveningwaist," said
the woman, "quite low, ahd use up
*w*hat's left on the sleeves."
The waist was a most effective one,
and the sleeves were balloons as fash
ion requires, but short-so short they
were nothing more than toy balloons
on the shoulders.
Haec fabula docet, there's more stuff
in one sleeve to-day than in your grand
mother's whole wardr6be.
But to return to our muttons. An
other gown for the charity ball was of

Is it because of "Mme. Sane-Gene"
that the Napoleon gown is suddenly in
such high favor?
Neither cause is it, nor elect; but
only one part of a world-wide move
ment at which we may only wonder,
not fathom. Nor are there historic
gowns in any period more beautiful
than the stately robes of Queen Caro
line and the princess of Lucca and
Piombino, with their remarkable traina
falling from the very ashoulderblades,
and their rich embroidery, and the
white satin ball dress of the jolly wash
erwoman-duchess herself. They are
charming, I repeat, and the dress
makers study them with their eyes and
wish for chalk and tape for further in
.quiry. Tea gowns and ball gowns
and dinner gowns in empire modes we
may have-but there stop. The street
is not for such.

Among the maty remarkable things for
which 1894 will be remembered is the
feet that it really brought to womankind

rather will the knickers wane in size to

A DAMNING RECORD.
aces Which show the lottenuess of Be
publloan Metbods.
The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, which
sometimes rises above partisanship, is
subject to the most disastrous relapses.
Here is an instance of the latter:
"It is a well-known faotthat the present un
fortunate situation Is due mainly to a ladical
£e.arture from the republican policy under'
which such a sitLalion was unknown. The
desoera'sIt tariff law has reduced the revenue
to point which causes a monthly defiit, and
democratio schemes of currency reform have
seriously impaired she pblUo erediL "
This is not well known, and it is not
t the fact.
We- will not say that tl4 trouble
about the gold reserve and the eurren-.
peperlly began under the Harrison
Sdminlsdtration, for such-trouble really
begins when the ,r.it. false step is
taken, pad that was year beforro . Blut
p.·61ht4bJ e u began to
manifest itself distinctly and unnis
takably under the Harrison adminis
tration, and that it progressed so far
I_ that even in the last month of that ad
Sministration Secretary Foster had pre
pared,to issue bonds. This was charged
last fall, and when Foster was asked
to deny it, he wrote .to Washington to
inquire whether there was any record
evidence there that he had done :this.
'Being informed that none had been
found, he wrote a letter saying there
was no foundation for the statement.
Then a letter of his own was printed
giving directions for the preparation of
the plates, and the plates themselves
are still in existence.
A few indisputable facts are worth
braries full of theories. Specie -pay
nents were resumed January 1, 1879.
For the fiscal years from 1879 to 1881,
inclusive, the redemption of United
States notes averaged 2.,605,O000per
annum. All understood that:they
could -get gold for greenbacks - awhen
they wanted it, and, consequently, few
wanted it. The banks furnished the
gold needed for export. For the fiscal
year 1892 the redemptions amounted to
89,125,000. This was under the Harrison
'administration, and before the elec
tion. The distrust caused by the Sher
man act and the McKinley bill had al
ready begun. For the twenty-seven
months succeeding the close of the
fiscal year 1892 the redemptions
amounted to 8206,500,000. All of this
period, except thirty-four days, was
under the McKinley bilL
Prior to the period of distrust which
began under Harrison the normal
amount of gold received for customs at
New York was about 75 per cent. From
i Jty 1, 1892, to September 30, 1894-all
of which period, except thirty-four
days, was under the McKinley bill-it
was only about 12 per cent., and dur
ing the last seventeen monthsgpnly 3.7
per cent. The movement upon the
gold reserve, therefore, and the virtual
suspension of specie .payment by the
banks, began under the Harrison ad
ministration, and has gone on at an
accelerating ratio. Account for it as
you may. that is thg simple fact. Im
partial financiers attribute-it to the
Sherman and the McKinley sets.
It may be asked, what had the Me
Kinley bill to do with it? It certain
lyhad as much to do with it as the now
tariff act, and republican papers say i
that the latter is the cause of the pres
ent trouble because it does not yield b
revenue enough. Now the McKinley S
bill is subject to the same objection. n
The republicans deny this, because a
they say there was no deficit till the ii
McKinley bill was repealed. They try P
to establish this by showing that there t]
was no deflcit "at the end of a fiscal L
year," while the McKinley law was in
force. But every intelligent person
knows that this is a quibble and a mere
attempt to palter with us on a double
sense. It is easily demonstrable that
the McKinley bill did not yield revenue a
enough to meet the enlarged scale of
expenditure to which the republicans
committed the country.
The Harrison administration began
dissipating the surplus even before the
McKinley bill was passed. The habit '
of estimating this surplus at 8100,000,- t
000 is misleading. Mr. Cleveland left A
in 1889 an accumlated surplus of about s]
8100,000,000, and besides, the revenues a
were some 8100,000,000 a year in excess 0
of expenditures. If the revenue had b
been kept up and expenditures kept
down during Mir Harrisons term the tI
surplus would have been nearer $500,- c
000.000 than 8100.000,000. A reduction of k
revenue was, therefore, proper if ex- a,
penditures had been kept down. But S
the Fifty-first congress, while reducing a
the revenue, increased expenses, and n
this led invariably to a deficit. ii
The Harrison administration adopted a
several expedients to avoid the appear
ance of a deficit. First it squandered p
the surplus--not only the surplus in
March, 1889, but that which accumu
lated between that time and the pas- a
sage of the McKinley bill. Then it a
changed the form of the debt statement. .
Then it seized a trust fund of 835,000,- a
000, held for the redemption of the
bank notes, and used that, and much a
of it was not refunded before the expi- !
ration of Mr. Harrison's term. Then
finding itself unable conveniently to
pay more than $25,000,000 of bonds due
September, 1891, it continued them. In t
these various ways, by the shifte and n
evasions of bookkeeping, it contrived a
to conceal the deficiency of revenue
which existed under the McKinley bill.
If the McKinley bill furnished rev
enue equal to expenditures, why was
the surplus dissipated? Why was the
national bank redemption fund seized? P
Why were 125,000,000 of bonds contin- h
ued within less than a year after the '
McKinley bill was passed? In all but
the name this was a borrowing of "
money, and this would not have been
necesssgy if the McKinley bill had o1
been affrding adequate revenue.
As to the present tariff, it has not yet di
become fully operative. Very little u
duty has been collected on sugar sia
none on incomes. It is generally tc
believed that after this fscal year it
will afford abundant revenue for. an c
administration of the government ot o
more prodigal thau it is at present.-

NOTES AND COMMENTS.
-The new republican legislature -
of West Virginia starts out by electing
Steve Elkins to the senate and making
an outrageously partisan congression

brooms sometimes sweep anything but
"clean."'-Louisville Courier-Journal.
----Gov. McKinley is not saying a
word while the subject of supplying a
treasury deficit is agitating the nation.
As a financier, the little major has
shown a wonderful ability for getting
a great state into debt, but when it
comes to paying off he is simply not to
be counted in.-Detroit Etee Press.
- - "Go in, Steve!" was the remark
that a distinguished statesman of thisd
country once made to Stephen B. El
kins when he was negotiating clbims
against the United States in one of the
South American countries. The umani
mous nomination of the same gentle
man for the West Virginia senatorship
indicates that he hasn't forgotte this
advice.-Boston Herald.
-The nomination of Elkins for the
West Virginia senatorship does not ex-:
press the will of the honest masses of -
the republican party in that state or in.
any other. It could not have happened.
