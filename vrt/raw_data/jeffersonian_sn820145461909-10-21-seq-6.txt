O LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE O
DEATH OF JOHN H. BOWERS.
The death of this good man, which
occurred August 3, 1909, near Canon,
Ga., was an irreparable loss to the
entire community. In 1857 the
writer was in school with our friend
now dead, and has known him pretty
well all along the line of life ever
since. The deceased began life a poor
boy, but acquired considerable prop
erty by industry and economy. As a
soldier, )ie served through the great
er part of the Civil War. Was se
verely wounded at the battle of Cold
Harbor, Virginia, from which he
never fully recovered.
Our esteemed friend lived an ex
emplary life, which should serve as
a beacon to guide us over the stormy
sea of life to the haven of safety.
Remember, relatives and friends, our
loss is his great gain. This can truth
fully be said of our noble dead—the
world is better by his having lived
in it. Dear friend, thou art dead, but
yet liveth. A FRIEND.
Ed. Comment: I regret that this
notice has not appeared before. The
original copy went astray, somehow.
Mr. Bowers was, indeed, a model citi
zen, an honor to any community.

NOT THE POINT AT ALL.
Dear Sir: —As I am a native Geor
gian, now living in Alabama, I
thought I would write to tell you that
the Prohibitionists haven’t gone too
far over here. There is not a law
abiding citizen in Alabama that is
afraid of having his house searched.
It is the same old issue—liquor or no
liquor. It is said that that man Nel
son in Mobile has been running a
blindtiger in his home ever since
prohibition went into effect.
I remain as ever, your true friend
and admirer,
R. E. SMITH.
Attala, Alabama.
Ed. Comment: It is not a ques
tion of being afraid of the search.
I am not afraid of being “searched”
for concealed weapons, for I do not
carry them —but my sense of person
al dignity would be outraged if every
policeman had the right to search
me.
I’ve already stated that the law
and the fact are different from what
1 was made to believe when the edi
torial referred to was written.

THE YOUNG MEN ARE ANXIOUS
TO GET INTO THE WORK.
My Dear Sir: —On page five of the
Jeffersonian of September 9th ap
pears a letter in which I suggest the
organization of a new political party,
to stand primarily for direct legis
lation by the people and to be known
as the Legislative Party. I now come
again, not with a new suggestion,
but with the same suggestion in a
new form, and endeavor, briefly, to
set out some of the chief arguments
in support of the suggestion.
Let me say first that I heartily
endorse the Jeffersonian Clubs as a
practical means of organizing such
a party. I also endorse the “By-
Laws of Jeffersonian Club No. 1,” as
published in your issue of Septem
ber 23d, with one exception, and to
meet that exception I now propose two
amendments:
First: Amend paragraph 10 by
substituting the words “Legislative
Party” for the words “People’s Par
ty”, where it now appears in said
paragraph.
Second: Eliminate paragraph 11
entirely and substitute in lieu there
of the following:
“11. We advocate the union of all
earnest reformers of all political par
ties whatsoever of the United States,
under the banner of a new political
party to be known as the Legislative
Party, its name being derived from
the fact that it shall stand first, last,
and all the time for direct legisla
tion and government by the people.
A part of every platform of the Leg
islative Party, whether it be nation
al, State or county, shall be:
“We demand that the principles of
the Initiative, the Referendum and
the Recall be written into all the fun
damental laws by which we are gov
erned, to wit: the charters of every
municipality, the constitutions of ev
ery State, and the Constitution of the
United States.
“From now henceforth until these
principles are written into the basic
laws of Nation, State and Municipali
ty, we demand that, in so far as the
present charters and constitutions
will allow, all laws passed by any
legislative body whatsoever for the
government of any part of the people
shall contain a provision that such
law shall not become operative until
it shall have been thoroughly adver
tised and submitted to a vote of the
people to be affected thereby, and
shall have received the approving
ballot of the majority of those voting
at such election.
We also demand the election of
United States Senators by direct vote
of the people.
“And, since the Referendum and
the Recall will multiply the impor
tance of the ballot-box, we demand
the adoption of the Australian ballot
system in such form as to protect
to the uttermost limit possible the
secrecy and sanctity of every ballot
cast.
“We maintain that the American
people are capable of self-govern
ment; that the voters themselves re
alize their needs and know their
wants; and that they have the cour
age, as well as the capacity, to vote
their wills at the polls—whether the
matter be that of enacting a law or
of electing a servant to execute the
law, or of recalling previously elect
ed or appointed servants for malfeas
ance in office or for other sufficient
cause.
“We cordially invite to our ranks
all white voters, without regard to
their previous party affiliations, who
sincerely desire a government of the
people, for the people, and by the
people. And, with equal cordiality,
we invite the antagonism of those
who deny that the American people
are capable of self-government; who
seek to set up themselves, or their
friends, or their henchmen, to do the
thinking for us; who cling to that
worm-eaten theory of kings, that a
few alone are capable of self-gov-
Jeffersonian
ernment, but that their capacity is
sufficient for the government of them
selves and the masses of the people.”
“No other plank shall be added to
any platform until it shall have
been approved by a three-fourths ma
jority vote of the members of the
Jeffersonian Clubs interested therein;
but any proposed plank receiving
such a majority shall be added.”
The reasons for -adopting a plat
form of this kind in preference to
that of the People’s Party, or that of
any other party now in existence, are
many and varied. Some of them
are as follows:
1. Such a platform would be a
vote getter; and votes alone can give
a party strength. There is not an
argument against it that can be ef
fectively presented to the voter. No
man who is a Democrat in fact as
well as in name can oppose it.
2. There is not a Populist in the
United States but who will endorse
this part of the platform of his own
party; and, with rare exceptions, they
are democratic enough in spirit to
leave the settlement of all other is
sues to the will of the majority of
the people as it may be expressed
under the Referendum. We would,
therefore, not lose anything by such
a platform.
3. It will draw its thousands of
voters from the ranks of the Demo
cratic party, thousands who can not
accept all of the platform of the
People’s Party. For there are yet
in that party thousands of voters who
are democratic enough in fact as well
as in name to leave to the will of the
majority, of all the voters the settle
ment of all issues, who will vote
against certain proposed laws when
they are submitted, but who will not
oppose the submission of such laws
to a vote of all the people.
4. Tn the same way it will draw
strength from the Republican party,
the Socialist party, and all others
that may be. The new party will,
therefore, gain its thousands where
the old People’s Party would gain its
Hundreds or even its scores.
5. This platform will be accepta
ble to tens of thousands of people
who will not accept the Populist plat
form regarding railroads. It will be
acceptable to thousands of people
who will not accept the Populist plat
form regarding our money system.
The same may be said of many other
laws proposed by the People’s Party.
But such voters may be quite willing
for any or all of such proposed laws
to be submitted to a vote of all the
people for their approval or disap
proval at the polls.
6. A new party will have the
strength and vigor and aggressive
ness of youth. It will not have the
uninspiring record of any of the old
parties to combat or to contend with.
It can concentrate all its energy on
a forward march to the making of a
record.
7. This is not true of the People’s
Party. If it did not die in 1896
when, against the advice of its brain
iest leader, Tom Watson, of Georgia,
it fused with the Democrats, it at
least received a wound that has for
ever since rendered it hors du com
bat.
8. It is easier to raise up new
Egyptians than to pump life into the
mummies that are found in the pyr
amids. It is easier to organize a new
party than to revive the one that
fused with the Democrats in 1896.
That attempt at fusion resulted in a
fizzle; the Populist leaders (Tom
Watson excepted) simply fizzled the
Populist party out of useful exist
ence.
9. The new party offers the fewest
possible points for attack by the op
position. It allows its own mem
bers to divide where they differ and
to do it without dividing or affect
ing in the least the party organi
zation or loyalty. At the same time,
it offers an effective democratic mode
of relief for all the ills of our gov
ernmental system.
There are various other reasons
that might be given but for the
length of this letter. I sincerely
trust that such a party as is here
proposed may be soon organized.
When it is, I am with it; and
I tell -you, sir, that I am only
one of thousands of young men
of the same view, right here
in Georgia. I have never voted
any but the Democratic ticket. I
have no hope of that party ever ac
accomplishing anything. But its
prospect is as bright as that of the
People’s Party. There is no need of
a sane man jumping from the frying
pan into the fire. Until a new and
brighter prospect is offered, inertia
alone will keep me in that party
which, with a degree of fitness that is
marvelous and rare, adopts as its pic
tured representative a sleepy-eyed
and long-eared jackass.
Very respectfully,
LEGISLATOR.
Sylvester, Ga.
A STRONG ENDORSEMENT.
Dear Sirs:—l herewith hand you
check for sl.lO for the weekly Jef
fersonian. I did not know my sub
scription had expired. I had not
noticed the label date. The Jeffer
sonian won its way into my office on
its intrinsic merit. It is a bright,
virile, fearless paper, without any
special political interest to serve.
Its patriotism and mission is as broad
as the American continent. I like it
because its editor sees some things
ahead of us and would warn us of
their evil consequences.
Yours truly,
WALTER E. STEED.
Butler, Ga., Oct. 11, 1909.
A NOBLE TRIBUTE, THIS.
My Dear Mr. Watson:—Enclosed
find a poem which I submit to
you for the purpose of publi
cation in the November issue of
your Magazine. As you see, I am
not the author. I am a crank about
poetry and have this in my scrap
book and have copied it for you,
thinking you may consider it appro
priate for the November issue—the
Thanksgiving month. If it is too late
or no space left, I would be glad if
you will publish later.
Let me say to you that I have
read your article on Socialists and
Socialism, and also your polemic bat
tle with Dr. White, and I want to
pronounce them great. The South is
