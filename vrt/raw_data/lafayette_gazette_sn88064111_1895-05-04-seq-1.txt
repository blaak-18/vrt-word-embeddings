HAD a head
ache. I don't
see any especial
reason why a
young man of
good moral character and temperate
habits, who takes eight hours' sleep
seven nights in the week, should have
a headache, but I did. It was one of
those popping kinds of headaches that
make one feel as if his lungs had gone
to his head and they were trying to ex
pand there about four diameters, at in
tervals of a minute. I believe they
call them nervous hetdaches, but I
fancy they wouldn't be any more
agreeable by any other name. Then
my heart was as heavy as lead, and
once or twice as I walked along I
really feared it was going to pull loose
from its fastenings and drop down
upon my duodenum, or whatever it is
that the ddetors tell us is concealed in
our persons in that neighborhood. Pos
sibly it was the heavy heart that gave
me the headache. But no. I recall
now that I was going to see Kitty, the
one girl in the whol# world that made
it any kind of a world for me, and we
had had a slight misunderstanding. It
wasn't the head that gave me the
heart ache; it was the heart that gave
me the headache. 1 believe I said that
I took eight nours' sleep seven nights
in the week. At this point I wish to
modify that statement. In the week
past, I had done so only six nights, for
the night before the day on which I
was on my way to see Kitty we had
disagreed with each other. I don't
think I slept at all.
I was going now to see the young
woman and settle the matter finally,
and though I was a promising young
lawyer ready to make a case for any
body else, I had no papers in this
case, and was going empty-handed. I
didn't even have so much as my brief
with me.
At the door Mrs. Milthy-Mrs. Milt
by is Kitty's mother, and a most ex
emplary and motherly soul-met me
and on the instant started back in
amazement.
"Why, John"-she always called me
John, for she had known me since I
was a mere haby-"why Johh," she
exclaimed, "whatever is the matter
with you? You look like you were go
ing to have a bad spell."
"Oh, that will be all right in a day
or so," I replied, evasively. "I have a
severe headache. Is your daughter at
home?"
"You mean Kitty?" she asked in sur
prise.
"Of course," said I. "You haven't
any other daughter, have you?" and I
made believe to smile.
"Oh, I didn't know," she stammered.
It was cruel to tease her, and with a
supreme effort I talked rationally to
her for a few minutes-they seemed
like hours to me-and then she said
she would go and tell Kitty.
As for myself, I went into the little
parlor and waited. Ilow sweet and
pretty it looked, and how like a sand
stone on a gold setting I felt. Every
thing was as I had seen it so often, the
picture of her grandpa over the cot
tage piano; the frame in which my pic
ture had been for so many months,
but empty now, on the corner of the
mantel; the large photograph of Saint
Cecilia looking heavenward, as we had
so often told each other we always felt
when we were together; the two big
friendly chairs inviting each other to
come nearer, which we always sat in
when I first came in the evening, and
the snug little sofa in the corner that
was always my point of departure
when I told her good night, and went
my way back to my own cheerless
apartments in a homeless boarding
house. I looked at them all, and as
the drowning man sees all his sins be
fore him, so did I see all these things
twice over, and multiplied by the thou
sand as the greatest blessings of my
life. Then I shut my eyes. I couldn't
help it. -My head felt as if a dozen
sets of lungs had got into it and were
doing expansion turns for a prize.
1 opened my eyes suddenly at the
sound of a voice.
"Mother told me you wished to see
me," it said, as chilly as if it had been
left out over night in the frost.
"Oh, Ki-" I began, as I stood up be
fore her. "I beg your pardon," I con
tinued; "your mother was quite right.
I did wish to see you."
"'I can scarcely understand why,"
she wvent on. "after what occurred last
night. Still, you may be able to ex
plain and I am willing to listen, at
least for a few minutes. I have an
engagement," she added, with the
faJ test kind of a smile.
Swas such a miserably mean little
smile, I thought, that it was ashamed
to show itself openly.
"Oh, don't let me detain youn" I tried
to say, with biting sarcasm, but I only
bit my tongue in saying it.
"I shall not," she replied. "'When I
am ready to go I will let you know.
Pray be seated," and she waved me to
my chair again, taking one of our
"our," think of that--big chairs and
nestling down in it so cozily that I
wanted to throw a book at her.
'I presume," I said, "your engage
ment is with that Mlr. Kilmer and my
presence here is an intrusion."
"'Oh, no," she said, "no intrusion at
all. At least, not yet. He was here
this morning and told me he would
not be around again until fouro'clock."
She looked up at the pretty brass
clock I had given her. Both its tiny
hands were clasping the figure three.
Three-quarters of an hour, and a whole
lifetime thereafterl
"Isn't it enough that you should have
killed me,"I said, "without being so
eager to cut me up?"
"I was merely defending a friend,"
she retorted.
"And you olaim Kibarw a friend?"
"1 ceretainy do. Isn't he frilend of
yours?"
"Not at all. If he were, he would
not have interfered with my happiness
as he has done."
"I beg your pardon," she said. "I1
didn't know he had."
"Didn't I tell you last night he was
a scoundrel, intent only upon sepa
rating us?" I asked, hotly.
"And didn't I tell you that I would
permit no friend of mine to be called a
scoundrel by anyone without resent
ing it to the utmost?" she replied.
"But I did call him that," I insisted.
"Yes, and what good did it do you?"
she said, stepping to the mantel and
holding out the empty frame in which
my picture had formerly been the at=
traction.
"His will take place of the former
occupant?" I said, scornfully.
"His or another's," she responded,and
actually giggled.
"Great Scott!" I exclaimed, staggering
to my feet, "am I then a two-fold dhpe?
Are the returns all in? Have the back
counties been heard from, Miss Milt
by?" and I buried my face in hands.
"Mr. Kilmer is, at least, enough of a
gentleman, scoundrel though you say
he is," she said, "not to talk to a lady
as you do."
"Oh, Ki-I beg your pardon, Miss
Miltby," I apologized, "I hope you 'will
forget that I spoke so rudely. Indeed,
I did not mean it."
"I don't see what reason you have
for objecting to Mr. Kilmer paying me
any attention he sees fit to pay," she
told me for an answer. "I have known
him for a long time and he is held in
the highest esteem by everyone except
you."
"But I have known you quite as long
as he has," I contended.
"Which is hardly a reason for acting
as you are now acting," she said.
"Does he love you?" I asked, and I
could feel a thousand throbs in my
head at once.
"I presume not," she replied, smiling.
"If he does he has been too modest to
say so."
"Do you love him?"
"That is my own affair," she an
swered, freezingly.
I threw my hand quickly to my side,
for, as I live, I thought that instant
that my heart would certainly break
loose and drop down. I think if I
could have stepped on a scale that mo
ment with it in my bosom, I would
have weighed a ton.
"It is not altogether yours," I said,
with a gasp.
"No?" and the interrogation point
ran up into her eyebrows and arched
them sharply like a spear point, it
sedmed to me.
"No, and I want you to so under
stand it." I was growing desperate.
"1 have some rights which I propoge to
see are respected, and I shall not stand
like a post and be dumb as one."
"And what rights have you, pray,
that I should respect them?" she asked,
so sarcastically that I felt as if I had
stepped across the path of a cutting
hailstorm.
"The right of having my claim heard
before it is disallowed and thrown out
of court," I responded, dropping into
shop talk without knowing it.
"Have you ever presented your
claim?" she inquired with judicial dig
nity.
Had I? That was the question. Had
I? For years I had known Kitty Milt
by. We had grown up from childhood
HIOLDINO OUT THE EMPTY FBA~E.
together. We had gone to school to
gether. For months I had lovet her.
By day she was ever in my thoughts,
and by night her spirit filled my
dreams with music. I had given her
my heart without the asking, but I had
never asked for hers. It didn't seem
necessary. I thought of course she
knew I wanted it. Now, I was brought
face to face with the facts. Had I ever
presented my claim? Well, I had not.
At least, not with the formality which
my training as a lawyer demanded
that I should.
"Oh, Kitty, Kitty," and I almost
cried from the reaction. "I -love you
more than all the world, andvi-"ant
you as much as I want all the world;
for you are the world to me. Now,
will-you say that my claim has not
been presented?"
It doesn't make any difference what
she said, or how she said it, or wheth
er my arms were on tahe mantelpiece, or
where they were, and it's nobody's
business how much that man Kilmer
had to do with bringing me to a rea
lizing sense of my situation, or why he
and Kitty smiled when I told him it
was all right.
I think Kilmer is the best fellow in
the world, and so does Kitty, with one
exception.
When I left the house Mrs. Miltby met
me in the hall.
"Here's a sovereign remedy for the
headache, John," she said, handing me
a bag of herbs, "I've used it for forty
years, and it never fails."
"Oh, that's all right, moth-Mrs.
Miltby," said I; "I guess I'm cured of
that kind of headache forever," and if
she hadn't stood in the door as I went
dojvn the walk, I'm sure I should have
jumped clean over the gate, and acted
in a manner utterly unworthy of my
dignity as a rising young lawyer.
It was six p. m., and Kitty had not
missed her engagement at four, be.
cause by that time it was peripapozitly
sbetti.-Detroit N'i ree Pea.
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.
That is What the Deatlat of the Present
Gives yn.
Perhaps no profession has made more
progress in the last thirty years than
dentistry haa done. Half a century
ago dentistry, as a separate branch of
the medical profession, was but little
known, and dentists were but very
few, even in the great cities. The reg
ular physician pulled the aching tooth, i
and we have even seen a case where he
filled it, and the filling, owing to the
healthy character of the bone, possi
bly, remained in that tooth for all of a
long lifetime. At that period the dent
ist traveled about from one town to
another through a wide district, and
people who availed themselves of his
services were thought to be rather fan
tastical, and foolish and extravagant
as well. In a case where new front
teeth were wanted the old tooth was
sawed off and the nerve was destroyed
with hot irons and infinite torture. in
order that a new tooth might be driven
in on a wooden peg, a tooth that was a
perpetual trouble and never perma
nent. A tooth that ached then was ex
tracted without remorse, and a filling, 1
when fillings came to be known, as
often dropped out as staid in. Now,
on the contrary, if the tooth
must be parted with, there are
so many ways of evading the
pain that, had they existed in the.old
time, Isaac of York might have kept
his money, and the anodynes are so
used that the patient is conscious and
sees the whole operation and suffers
nothing at all. But no tooth is taken
out now that can possibly be kept in.
If a nerve must be killed it is usually
killed painlessly, and the tooth that
once could not bear permanent and
solid filling is treated till it is able to
do so. Even when a tooth is so nearly
gone that retaining points for the fill
ing are not to be had, tiny gold screws
can be inserted whose heads answer
for the points, a fine gold wire can hold
the fragile sections together and be
built about, and anodynes have been
found that can be injected into the
gum or applied to it and do away with
much of the pain once attending a bad
excavation or a tender filling. Fillings
are made so artistically, too, as almost
to be beautiful in themselves; and it ih
even possible, in case of a cavity on the
front surface of a tooth, to insert a bit
of enamel so delicately that even the
cracks can not be discerned. -Harper'E
Bazar.
HALF SOLED WHILE YOU WAIT.
Memories Evoked by a Familiar Sign On e
Shoemaker Shop.
"Your shoes half soled while you
wait" is a Madison street announce
ment which recalls many pleasant
memories to the man who was raised
in the back country and paid periodi
cal visits to the crossroads cobbler dur
ing boyhood days. The face of an old
man with all of his hair on his chin,
and that white with age and streaked
with tobacco juice, sitting on a low
shoemaker's bench in a little back
kitchens of a log house in the woods
rises before me as I pass. I smell the
sole leather soaking in the tub near
the red hot kitchen stove, and hear the
play of the shining hammer as the old
man beats the stiff cowhide on his
knee. And such knees. Many a time
have I seen him crack walnuts on them
with no other protection than his shoe
maker's apron. The old man always
performed that trick for my boyish
edification as I sat metaphorically at
his feet of a cold winter's night and
my shoes were being half soled while
I waited. It seemed to give him as
much pleasure as it did me.
He was a philosopher who had seen
much of the great world, and had re
tired from it to the low cabin in the
back woods of northern Indiana, and
as he drove the box-wood pegs home
with certain aim he awoke in me the
overmastering desire to see some of
that same world on my own account.
He seemed to me to know everything
worth knowing, and scrupled not to
part with fractions of that knowledge
upon the slightest provocation. The
shoe-pegs or waxed ends in his mouth
never interfered materially with his
volubility. Nothing ever disturbed his
good humor.
That was forty years ago, but I re
member the deeply sympathetic glance
from the mild blue eyes of the old shoe
maker as he turned them from the
shoe he was trimming, and bent them
upon me one night after I had given
expression to a desire to "see the
world."
"You'll be disappointed, boy-there's
nothing in it."-Chicago Times.
The Music lRogm.
When it is possible, in arranging
your music room, always place the
piano with its back to the room, not
agaist the wall, as it is so frequently
seen. It is the best arrangement both
from a. musical and from an artistic
standpoint. As the plain uncovered
back of the piano is not usually beau
tiful, one sees in different houses vari
ous graceful designs for hiding it.
Sometimes it is a beautiful piece of
painted tapestry, a musical subject be
ing the most appropriate. It is hung
from the back by a brass rod. Scarfs
of liberty satin or other beautiful
pieces of rrch and flexible silk are also
used, kept from slipping by two or
three handsome ornaments, such as a
pair of Florentine candelabra, a few
framed photographs or miniatures of
musicians, or a bowl of flowers.

IN THI ELECTRICAL WORLD.
-The Swiss liudensrath is urging
the construction of an electric railroad
to the summit of the famous Jungfrau.
It is proposed to operate the road by
power to be obtained from the Grindel
wald glacier, or from the water of the
Tummell river.
-Vulcanized rubber used for insulat
ing electric wires is so injurious to cop
per that it has been found necessary to
plate the wire with tin, then insulate
it with unvulcanized rubber, and then
cover the whole with vulcanized rub
ber. In this way the sulphur in the
latter is prevented from acting upon
the copper.
--The attorneys for the Western
Electric Co., of New York, are prepar
ing the papers in infringement suits
which will be at once instituted
against magneto telephone manufac
turers and dealers in New York and
vicinity. There are about thirty of
these suits in preparation and the ball
is to be set a-rolling at once.
-The New England Telephone &
Telegraphic Co. has petitioned for a
permanent injunction against the
Brattleboro (Vt.) G;as Light Co., con
trolling the electric light plant in Ilrat
tieboro, to restrain it from so using its
wires as to interfere with the opera
tions of the-telephone plant. The tel
ephone service has been worthle.s at
night because of induction.
-The contract for the construction
of a telephoi- aystem for the interior
department at Washington, D. C., has
been awarded to the Western Tele
phone Construction Co., of Chicago, for
$5,565.76, which was the highest bid
received. The bids of the competing
companies were rejected, some because
their instruments were infringements
on patents of other companies, and
others because their switchboards
would require two operators.
-A case of electricity generated by
a plate of false teeth occurred recently
in England. A man feeling a severe
pain in his tongue consulted a doctor
and a dentist, neither qf whom could
find anything wrong. /He then went
to.an electrician who/found that his
false teeth were fastened to the com
position plate with two metals: they
were connected by wires to a ganlvan
ometer, which, as soon as the metals
were moistened by the saliva, showed a
current strong enough to cause ulcer
ation and severe pain. The plate was
covered with an insulating varnish,
which put an end to the trouble.
-Some interesting experiments in
the lineof the direct conversion of cal
orific into electrical energy have been
made by D)r. WV. Biorchers, of l)uisburg,
Germany, and they were described by
him at a recent meeting of the (Ger
man Electro-Chemical Association.
The first attempts in this line were de
voted to the production of an electric
current by the "combustion" of car
bolic oxide gas; but l)r. liorchers has
also succeeded in obtaining the same
result from treating hydrogen, coal
gas, and even coal dust.
-Some young men still persist in
studying telegraphy on their own pri
vate account, and fyr such there are
full outfits, including a book of in
struction, at a cost of about five dol
lars. The man that thus learns teleg
raphy is a little like the one that
learns French without a master; his
pronunciation, so to speak, is peculiar,
and the pronunciation of the skilled
telegrapher has to him an unfamiliar
sound. Nevertheless, practice soon en
ables him to correct his defects of
sounding and hearing, and there was
a little group of farmers in one qf the
states of the middle west who set up a
private telegraph line. and in that set

That Was LMade Evident by the Contents
of Her 15tuf.
She was a tall, slim girl, of the

pinned on her fur cape, the collar of
which flared up at the back of her
head and turned away from her throat
in a dashing style. Her two slim
gloved hands were tightly clasped in a
muff, which was suspended around her
neck by a broad satin ribbon coquet
tishly knotted on the shoulder.
As she entered the car she cast one
timid glance, like that of a fluttered
bird, up the left hand row of seated
passengers and down the right, this
having the effect of causing two men
to crowd a place for her between themn.
She advanced to the vacant seat with
decorous, graceful steps and downcast
eyes, and as she swept her skirts about
to sit down she removed one hand from
her muff to settle them in place:
Just as she did so something awful
happened. A small, flat box of cigar
ettes fell from her muff. The cigar
ettes scattered on the car floor, at her
side. But she was equal to the emer
gency, and, with only a heightened
rose flush on her check, she dropped
her arm with a truly magnificent gest
ure to the car floor, and with a dexter
ous twist gathered in every one of the
cigarettes and the box, and replaced
them in her muff, crushed and man
gled, but hidden from sight. I watched
the whole performance, and felt like
breaking into applause, but several of
the men openly snickered, and all the
women looked shocked and demoral*

A Witty Reply.
The crown prince of Germany,
though only about twelve years old,
has a very ready wit and a queer way
of saying things. He sees the funny
side of a situation at once. One day,
while visiting Potsdam, the little
prince was amusing himself by trying
to make a donkey draw a cart. Bunt
the donkey was stubborn and would
not "go." "Your donkey has a great
dealof will power," called out the em
peror, who had been watching the
struggle between' little son and the
stubborn beast. " h, no, papa,"replied
the little Prince quickly, "it isn't his
will power tin troubles me. It is his
won't power. He won't go."-Azpsma

COMFORT AND DISPLAY.

door Elegance.
Volumes have been written on the
necessity of neat home attire, yet there
are still hundreds of families where
anything is good enough for the
house, if a showy outfit can be se
cured for display outdoors.
This state of things will probably
exist until people have learned to live
above sham and falsehood. There are
thousands of families who appear in
silken attire to the outward world,
while they wear the most slovenly
dresses in their own houses when
nobody is around. Such a condition
as this means" a disordered house, a
house where comfort is invariably sac
rificed to show. It consequently
means an unhappy home, where the
petty vexations of life bring about
continual bickerings. Nothing so
wears upon the temper and so tries
the disposition as disorder. A house
where everything is out of place is in
variably a most uncomfortable resi
dence. The few h6:urs of pleasure in a
gorgeous street appearance can not in
any way compensate for the many
hours of discomfort in an improperly
furnished home, or for the positive
bodily distress that results from wear
ing insufficient.or unsuitable clothes
within doors.
The first essential must be comfort-
warm underclothing and warm whole
stockings for winter, and neat house
dresses and aprons (for the house
keeper), and the essentials for the
kitchen and dining room-before more
elaborate display clothing and parlor
outfits ar- secured. .How few young
people go to housekeeping in this
spirit! How many begin by furnish
ing their parlor, and expect to secure
the furnishing of their kitchen with
the money that is left.' One method
means a comfortable home, with little
show, the other improperly served
meals, badly cooked for want of insuf
ficient materials and all the train of
evils that come in the wake of
such management. It is not too
much to say that hundreds of homes
are swallowed up in Charybdis of
domestic mismanagement. There is
very little human affection that will
survive greasy beefsteaks and under
done potatoes. Dyspepsia is a foe that
destroys the temper.
Undoubtedly one of the strongest
movements toward temperance among
the poor of the tenement-houses has
been the cooking-schooL If the wives
of poor men in this countrycould learn
to market wisely and cook intelligent
ly, as the French peasant women do;
there would be some chance of coping
with the great evil of strong drink. It
is a noteworthy fact that in America
and in England the amount of drink
ing among the poor classes is greatly
in excess of that in France, where
though light wines are con
sumed, strong stimulants are
almost unknown to the peas
antry, which is never un
derfed, and seems to feel no
such appetite for strong alcoholic
stimulants as the American and Eng=
glish worknen. Just in proportion as
the living space of the family is limited
to the poor, lone tenement-house dis
tricts of the great cities, does this ap
petite increase. The American work
man in the country is a sober man.
The American workman in the city is
too frequently intemperate. These
matters show conclusively the effects
of home discomfort. The countryman
has sufficient space to live in and pure
air to breathe. HIis wife has fewer
temptations to buy showy clothing and
is more inclined to spend her income
in substantial food and to take a pride
in preparing it well.-N. Y. Tribune
MEDICINE SHELVES.
N'o Family Should lie Without a Well
Stocked Set of Them.
A set of medicine shelves should be
among the furnishings of every well
regulated house. It may be made
rather an ornamental feature bf the
room where it hangs, being as like a
hanging cabinet as possible. The ideal
cupboard is divided lengthwise into
three parts, one of them fitted with
a door. The remaining two-thirds are
divided across, the upper compartment
being lockable, while the lower is sim
ply a shelf provided with .a silk cur
tain. The wood should be painted to
harmonize with the other furnishings
of the room, and the locks should be
pretty affairs of brass. The silk cur
tain should match the other draperies.
As to the contents of the cupboard,
it may contain all sorts of household
remedies. In one of the locked com
partments brandy, linseed oil, lint, a
spirit lamp and some alcohol should be
kept. In the other closet arnica, lau
danum, sal volatile, spirits of red lav
ender, camphor and other things which
may not be safely trusted to the iano
rant may be stored. Behind the cur
tain commonplace and harmless arti
cles such as even the inexperienced
may handle may be kept. Among
these are cold cream, vaseline, sticking
plaster, mustard leaves, and a few
other everyday requisites. A vise pre
caution is to copy on a card directions
as to procedure in case of emergency
such as how to dress a burn or bind
a cut, or to stop bleeding from the
nose, etc., and to fasten this card in
side the cupboard.-Detroit Free Pres.
