OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Most of you children go to Sunday
School, I suppose, and you know
something of the Bible stories—Ruth,
Joshua, Nathan, Samson, David, Sol
omon. Do you know what these peo
ple looked like, and what kind of a
country they lived in? Tissot, the
artist, spent years and years in the
East, studying, sketching and paint
ing until he had made 240 great
pictures of all the famous men and
incidents of the Bible. We have ob
tained copies of these pictures, all in
full colors, and all different. They
carry you from the Creation to the
close of Revelations, the end of the
world and the day of judgment. If
you will drop us a postal card, we
will mail you some samples of these
pictures, and tell you how to get the
complete set, in a handsome port
folio. For a little work among your
friends and to those who do the best
work we will give other prizes. You
will be delighted with the pictures,
when you see them.
FROM A PRIZE WINNER.
I received the first prize in the
name contest, a nice ring, and many
thanks for it. Have been offered a
good price for it, but would not take
it. I like it so much, will try to
win some more of the prizes. Please
send me the outfit, and I will try to
get some subscribers to the Jeffer
sonian and magazine.—Otis Curtis,
R. F. D. 4, Fitzgerald, Ga.
WAY DOWN EAST.
I am a little boy, ten years old, and
like to read the letters in the Post-
Card Club. We live out in the
country, but we have trolley lines
within a mile of our house. My papa
runs a truck farm, and we raise lots
of fruit and berries for the city mar
kets. I am going to school now.
When you offer another prize, I am
going to try to win it.—Charles E.
Jamieson, Tuckahoe, N. J.
FROM OLD VIRGINNY
My uncle takes the Jeffersonian,
and says it is the best paper ever
published. He has read every line
Mr. Watson ever wrote. We live
on a farm, and my uncle has some
fine horses and cattle. I like to ride
better than anything. T have a little
bay colt named Jimsie, and he can
out-jump anything in this country.
I am ten years old, and go to school
now. I ride to the school and back
every day, about four miles.—Walter
Markham, R. F. D. 2, Honaker, Va.
SIDE WHISKERS.
This is your picture, Daddy Jim.
I think it is just like you, and am
sure it will win the prize.—Virgil
Glenn, R. F. D. 1, Crest, Ga.
(A very small hat, a large head,
much wrinkled, a fancy nose, and
whiskers of the “mutton-chop” va
riety, very woolly and protuberant.
No, thank you, Virgil.)
IN THE NORTHWEST.
I made my big brother get your
paper in the summer, so that I could
read the children’s letters, and he
says he likes it so well that he wlil
keep on taking it. We live on a ranch,
Sfye Jeffersonian
and I have lots of pets. Mother gave
me some little ducks, and they keep
me busy finding water for them. We
have had a dry summer, and water is
scarce. I have a pony, and some
goats. I like to read good books, and
1 go to school, and am in the fourth
grade.—Perry McLinn, Frederickson,
N. Dak.
MORE PICTURES.
I am a boy, 12 years of age. Here
is your picture. I hope it is like you.
I go to school at Pelham, and like
to go very much. My father takes
the Jeffersonian, and my brother
takes the magazine. We all like to
read them. I think Mr. Watson is
a great man, and would vote for him,
if I were old enough. I will come
again if this escapes the waste bas
ket. Your new friend, John Cheves,
Pelham, Ga.
ANOTHER GEORGIA BOY.
I have seen so many bright letters
from the boys and girls, that I will let
you hear from another Georgia boy.
I am thirteen years old. takes
the Jeffersonian, and I like to read
it very much. I like to read the
Post Card Club. Excuse me for bad
writing.—Your little friend, Howard
L. Smith, R. F. D. 3, Lexington, Ga.
(Your writing is not bad at all;
but even if it were bad, I would not
make any excuses for it, if I were
you. Do the best you can, in writing,
and in everything else; and never
make excuses. There is an old French
proverb, which says: “Who excuses
himself, accuses himself.” As long
as you know that you are doing your
best, never mind what other people
think.)
