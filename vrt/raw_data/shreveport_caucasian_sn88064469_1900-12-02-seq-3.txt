Is valueless from a commercial point of
view, but to these Islanders he is the
source of atll, or nearly all, their in
come. The islander exchanges Jack's
fins and tail with the trader for to
bacco, calico. guns. ammunition and
gin. The native's wife when she meets
her brown skinned lord and master on
the tenchi as he returns from fishing
looks anxiously Into the blood stained
canoe to see how many kapakans, as
fins are called, be has taken. Two or
three dozen, when dried, mean to her
a new lint, trimmed perhaps with w
bright groen ribbon on a red and yel
low background, that the traer show
ed her some time previous.. Then she
picks up the "take," puts It Into a
basket, and an hour later Jack's mo
tive power Is suspended on a line be
tween two eucoanut trees, drying for
I arrk 't
Wonderfully constructed craft are
their canoesr They are made of small
strips of wood sewed together with a
cocoanut twine called cinnet Perhaps
20 or wore canoes go out together.
There is no need to go far. Just outside
the reef will answer. There Jack Is
waiting. arcompanied by relatives of
many diferent sizes. male and female.
Lying upon the grating of crossed
sticks reaehing from the outrigger of
the canoe to the gunwale Is the tackle.
Rude it Is, but effective. It consists of
a naturally formed wooden book, cun
ningly trainued when it was a young
tree root lnto the proper shape, and 40
fathornms of strong cocoanut fiber rope
as thick as whale line and fully as
strong.
Taking a flying fish or a piece of a
shark caught the previous day, the na
tive ties the balt around the curve of
the great hook. Then be lowers the
line. It sinks quickly, as the hook is
heavy. lPerhaps, if Jack ais a big fellow,
he will obstinately refuse to turn after
swallowing tie hook and will make a
strenuous effort to get away deep into
the blue glonm of a hundred fathoms
below. Meanwhile every other canoe
has probably hooked a shark, and there
is a wild clamor and much Lad lan
guage as tihe lines get fouled and ca
noes bang against each other. Per
haps four or live will be in a bunch,
one or two sharks lashing the water
into foam in the middle and turning
over and over with lightning rapidity
in the hope of parting the line or
smashing the outrigger. The latter re
suit is usually fraught with much dan
ger.
After the lapse of considerable time
the natives who are fast to the largest
shark may possil 1y tall to their com
rades that the fish is too powerful to
bring alongside and kill and will ask
for an implement known to whalers as
a drogue-a fat piece of wood which,
attached to the end of a line, gives
such resisting power that the shark or
whale dragging it behind Is soon ex
hausted. The drogue is passed along
from some other canoe and then made
fast to the end of a small but strong
line. At the loose end of the line is a
noose, and as Jack lifts his tail out of
the water the steersman slips it over,
and away go the line and drogue, the
man who is holding on to the main line
casting all of the slack overboard. so
as to give the shark plenty of room in
which to exhaust himself.
Aother method employed by these
alanders in killing sharks is to swim
abshout in the infested waters with a
knife clutched between the teeth. and
when Jack approaches the swimmer
grasps the knife in his hand and
thrusts it to the Ltilt into the shark's
stomach. This Is a very hazardous
undertaking, however, and,. as it fre
quently results in the death of the na
I thlve, it is not at all popular.

Without taking up any new hbusiness
this session will hare on its hands all
that it can reasoaiblr attend to. The
regular appropriantion hills, the consid
eration of which will of course take
considerable time. will have to be dis
posed of. and. In addition, there comnies
over from the recent session a vast vol
ume of business which should receive
final consideration. The last session
was perhaps the most prolific In the
history of congress so far as initiative
Is concerned. Nearly 5,(X0 bills orig
Inated in the senate and more than 12.
1100 In the house. Of this great num
ber only a few hundred were enacted
into laws, the multitudinous residue
remaining technIcally notitnlbed busi
ness, awaiting action at the coinlug ses
salon. It may be said, however, that
the greater part of this unfinished busi
ness can remain unfinished until the
crack of doom without detriment to the
public interests. llut there are a num
ber of important pending measures
whIch ought to lIe dlsposaled of. and, so
tar as possible, the calendar should be
cleared up and left uniucnumbered for
,the next congress.
One of the matters likely to receive
early consideration Is the proposition
for tbe reorganization of .he army, and
various plans are under consideration.
The war department has oade two
suggestlons which are being entertain
ed by the committees on military at- 1
fairs of both houses. If it shall be de
clued to recommend a standing army
of 05,000, the army oficlal* urge that
all thiat will be necessary LI the way
of legislation will be simply the repeal
of that clause of the existing law which
discharges the additional regular sol
diers on the 1st day of next July.
These men are all enlisted for three
years, and if the law which ditacharged
them on July 1, 1901. Is repealed they
will continue In service. This plan
finds considerable favor because of its
simplicity, although It does not allow
any elasticity In the strength of the
army. Another plan suggested 6 mod
eled very closely on the lHull bill of the
last session and is more likely to be
the one adopted. This itlan proposes
enough companies of 10 men each to
make an army of 50.000 men, this be
Ing the minimum strength. The law is
to be so framed, however, that the
companies can be increased to 120 men
each, which would bring the total num
ber up to 100,000 men. As at present
contemplated there are to be no addl
tional officers, the increase being en
tirely of enlistrd men. In view of the
fact that under the existing law the
president. as comomander in lchief of
the army of the United States, will be
In command of only 27.00( men, the
party of the administration will un
questionably take early and vigorous
steps towardl the enactment of aln ar
my reorganization bill which will ieiat
the approval of the chief execuitive. v
Doubtless there will be a spirited tight a
over the proposition. t
An increase in the navy as well as
the army is likely to be the subject of
some legislation by , tide congress,
though it will probably conme in connec- r
tion with the regular naval appropria- t
tion bill. According to the report of t
Rear Admiral Crowninshield on the
conditions and needs of the navy. thu re
should be something like 1.000 more of
ficers and 5.000 more men to bring it c
up to a state of efficiency. While we a
are building new warships we are not, P
the naval men contend, providing suff- t
ciently for manning them. In this con- r
nection It Is also probable that there
will be considered a plan for maintain
nlag a naval reserve force.

well as most of his predecessors for
more than a dozen years, favors such
ana adjunct to the postofilce depart

there appears to be developed against
it is on the part of the expres' carrying
corporations. This matter, as well as
provision for further extension of the

come up in connection with the piostal
