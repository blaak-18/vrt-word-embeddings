AFRAID OF THE WHITE
TOTE.
Messrs. M. F. Machen and 8. J.
Henry, of the committee appointed
to present a proposition to the Dem
ocratie executive committee, pre
sented a written request to present
the proposition to have a white
primary, in order that the subter
fuge of negro sopremacy might be
eliminated from this congressional
lection, at least. When the writ
ten request was read, Mr. Hewitt
made a motion to lay it on theta
ble without say action, but Mr.
Carver tboaj'ht possibly it might
Sbe better to treat the People's par

ed1 this method as one that would
forever settle the boasting of white
supremacy that has be.n held over
the people of the South for the
last twenty years or more.
The People's party is the only
party that has a clear cut issue
upon any of the grave questions
now involved in the affairs of this
great nation. Mr. Bailey comes
before the people upon these issues
while whoever may be the nominee
of the Democratic party, will be
without any platform, except such
as he may fir up on his own au
thority.
ION. B. W'. BAILEY,
People's Party Candidalte for
Cengressman of the 4th Con
gressional District.
lion Bryant W. Bailey of Winn
parish, is the son of Berrian F.
Bailey of Ala., who came to Winn
parish in 1866, and died near Winn
field in 1885, leaving a widow and
six children. Bryant being the
oldest, the care and management of
the farm and family devolved up
on him at the early age of 19 years,
but the strong will power and
strength of character that has al
ways impelled him forward in the
discharge of his duty under great
responsibility, was equal to the oc
casion, and let it De said to his
honor, that he never for a moment
faltered by the wayside until by
his own labor, his little brothers
and sisters had been reared to man
hood and womanhood, with such
an education as this country afford
ed, never forgetting the tender
care that is due a mother from a
dutifhl son.
Mr. Bailey's education is such
as could be derived from the com
mon schools, except about six
months attendance et the Atlanta
State Institute in 1891. Mr. Bai
ley being raised upon the farm with
a heavy burden to bear, and being
of an intelligent mind, it was but
natural that he began to form a
desire to investigate from the
cause to effect when the finan
cial crisis came, and so thorough
were his investigations that he is
now among the best posted on the
economic questions of the day.
He took an active part for Cleve.
land in the campaign of 1888, but
was too young to vote, but soon
became convinced that no relief
was to come through old organiza
tions of either of the old parties.
When the Farmers' Union sprung
up, he was a very active workerin
that and became associate editor of
the Comrade, a reform paper pub
ished in Winunfeld, La., and devo
ted to the principles of reform.
He now owns the entire plant in
that paper, and is running it as a
reform jourual in the interest of
the People's party.
Mr. Bailey stands squarely on all
of the Ocala demands, and will nme
his influaence to have them enacted
into law. Now, we can say to the
voters of the fourth congressional
district, that Mr. Bailey is a farmer
in the true sense of the word being
the man that held the plow in his
own hands, and therefore can sym.
pathiue with the man who toils in
the snn all the year to findl that his
labor has been shrinking in value
all the while. Mr. Bailey has othkr
advantages, that of being young
add rigorous, and having an en
ergetic mind that will always be
ready to grapple with any perplex.
lng issue that may arise. He is
not one of theye old war oreas that
is contaminated with rings and
clicks, but comes pare, right from
among the ranks of the people.
We believe Mr. Bailey to be as
true as steel, and if elected, we be
lieve he will be hithfl to the trust
emioded in him. Therefore, we
can eheerkUly recommend him to
the people as a man who will make
a true, homest, faithful servant of
the people, and for this reason we
ask the people to sapport him. He
is a striet member of the Baptist
chLrch, has mever been addited to
gambling or drinking, bat has lived
a pious ehristlan life, even in his
boyhood.
Vote for him and get every man

I Don't Fall to Read This.
We publish below two letters to
gether with a cotfideutial circular,
I all going to show the infamous plan
by which the people have been sys
tematically robbed. We take the
letters as published below from a
reprint of photographic copies.
We must say that this is the bright
est calcium light that has ever
been turned on to the perfidy that
is responsible for the present de
pressed financial condition. Read
them if you want to store your brain
with very important reasons why
the poor are growing spoorer and
the rich richer, and that in a time
when nature has so bountifully

Congress in 1863 to pass the Na
tional Bank act. I was born that
year, having been Isaped by the
IBritannic National Bank of New
York City, one of the first hundred
I beaks Organized under the law.
I The first preliminary step in the
organization of the Britannic Na
Itional Bank was taken in June
1863, when the accomlpanying let
ter from Rothschild Bros., was
written:

Messrs. Ikleheimer, Morton and Vander
gould.
No. 3 Wall Street, Now York, U, 8. A.
Duas Sans: A Mr. John Sher
man has written us from a town in
Ohick U. 8. A., as to the proits
that may be made in the National
I Banking busainess under a rcesnt
act of your Congress; a copy of
which act accompanied his letter.
Ajparently this act has been drawn
apun the plan formulated here last
summer by the British Banker's
Association and by that Asocia.
Stion recommended to our American
fMiends as one that ff enaeted into
law, woald prove highly protable
to tohe banking fraternity through
out the world.
Mr. 8herman declares that there
has never before been such an op
portunity for capitalists to acLcu
mulate money, as that presented
by the act and that the old plan of
State Banks is so unpopular, that
the new scheme will, by mere con
trast, be most tavorably regarded,
notwithstanding the fact that it
gives the National Batiks an almost
absolute control of the National
tinances. "The few who can un
derstand the system," he says,
* will either be so interested in its
profits, or so dependent on its fa
vors, that there will be no opposi
tion from that class, while on the
other hand, the great body of the
people, mentally incapable of com
prehending the tremendous adva:n
taszxes that capital derives from the
system, will bear its burdens with
out complaint, and perhaps with
out even sttspecting that the sys
tent is inimical to their interests."
Please advise us fully as to this
matter, and also, state whether or
not you will be of assistance to us,
if we conclude to establish a Na
tional ltsink in the .City of New
York. I I you are acquainted with
Mr. Shelrman (he appears to have
introduced the National Banking
act), we will be glad to know some
thing of him. If we avail our
selves of the information he fur

compensation.

can Agents for the lunvestment of En

New York, July 5th, 1863.
Messrs. Rothachild Brothers, London, En
gland :
DEAR SIRS: We beg leave to
acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of June 25th, in which you
refer to a communication received
from the lion. John Sherman of
Ohio, with reference to the advant
ages and profits of an American in
vestment, under the provisions of
our National Banking Act.
The fact that Mr. Sherman speaks
well of such an investment, or of
any similar one, is certainly not
without weight, for that gentleman
possesses in a marked degree, the
distinguishing 'characteristics of
the successful modern financier.
His temperament is such that
whatever his feelings may be they
never cause him to lose sight of the
main chance. He is young, shrewd
and ambitions. He has fixed his
eye upon the presidency of the
United States, and is already a
member of Congress. lHe rightly
thinks he has everything to gain
both politically and financially (he
has financial ambitions too), by be
ing friendly with men and institu
tions having large financial re
sources, and which at times, are
not too particular in their methods
either of obtaining governmental
aid, or protecting themselves
agaist unfriendly legislation, we
trust him here implicitly. His in
tellect and ambition combine to
make him exceedingly valuable to
us. Indeed, we predict that if his
life be spared, he will prove to be
the best friend the monied interests
of the world have ever l4ad in
America.
As to the organization of a Na
tional Bank here, and the nature
and profits of such an investment,
we beg to refer to our printed cir
cular enclosed herein. Inquiries
by European capitalists, concern
ing this matter, have been so nu
merous, that for convenience, we
have had our views with regard to
it put into printed form.
Should you determine to organ
ize a bank in this ecty, we shall be
glad to aid you. We can easily
findl financial friends to make a
satisfactory directory, and to fill
any official positions not taken by
the personal representatives you
will send over.
Awaiting youear further orders, we
are

CONFIDENTIAL CIRCULAR.
Ikleheimer, Morton & Vander
gould.
Private Bankers, Brokers, Finan
cial Agents, Etc.
3 'l Sl treet, New York City,
We have had so many inquires
of late, as to the method of organ
ising National Banks under the re
cent Act of Congress, and as to
the profits that may reasonably be
expected from such an investment,
thatwe have thought it best to is
sue this brief circular as an an
swer to all the qaestions of our
friends and clients:
1. Any number of persons, not
less than five, may organise . a NQa.
tional Banking COrporatiton.
2. Except in cities having 6,000
inhabitants or less, a National
Bank can not have less than $100,.
000o capital.
3. They are private corporations r
organized for private gain, and se
lect their own officers and em
ployes.
4. They are not subject to the
control of the State laws. except as
Congress may from time to time
provide. c
5. They can receive deposits
and loan the same for their own
benefit.
6. They can buy and sell bonds,
and discount paper and do a gener
al banking business.
7. To start a National lIank on
the scale of $1,00$),000 will require
the purchase of that amount '(p: r
value) of 17. S. Government bonds.
S. U. 8. Government bonds can
now be purchased at 50 per cent
discount, so that a bank of'$1,000,
(KHJ, capital can be started at this
time with only $:50,000.
9. These bonds must be deposi
ted with the U. S. Treasurer at 1
Washington, as security for the
National Bank Currency, that on
the making of the deposit will be
firnished by the Government to the
bank.
10. The U. S. Government will
pay 6 per cent interest on the
bonds, in gold, the interest being
paid semi annually- It will be
seen that at the present price of
bonds, the interest paid by the
Government, will of itself amount
to 12 per cent in gold, on all the
money invested.
11. The U. S. Government, un
der the provisions of the National
Banking Act, on having the bonds
aforesaid deposited with its Trea
surer, will on the strength of such
security, furnish National Currency
to the bank depositing the bonds,
to the amount of 90 per cent of the
face of the bonds, at an annual in
terest of only one per cent per an
num. Thus the deposit of $1,000,
000 will secure the issue of $900,
000 in currency.
12. This currency is printed by
the U. 8. Government in a form so
like Greenback money that many
people do not detect the difference,
although the currency is but a pro
mise of the bank to pay-that is, it
is the bank's demand note, and
must be signed by the bank's pre
sident before it can be used.
13. The demand for money is so
great that this currency can be
readily loaned to the people across
the counter of the bank, at a bank,
discount at the rate of 10 per cent
at 30 to 60 days time, making
about 12 per cent interest on the
currency.
14. The interest on the bonds,
plus the interest on the currency
which the bonds secure, plus the
incidentals of the business, ought
to make the gross earnings of the
bank amount to from 28 to 33 1-3
per cent. The amount of divi
dends that may be declared will
depend largely upon the salaries
the officers of the bank vote'them.
selves, and the character and ren
tal charges of the premises occu
pied by the bank as a place of
business. In case it is thought
best that the showing of profits
should not appear too large, the
now common plan of having the
directors buy the bank buidings
and then raising the rent and the
salaries of the president and cash
ier may be adopted.
15. National Banks are privi
leged to either increase or contract
their circulation at will and, of
course, can grant or withhold loans
as they may see fit. As the banks
have a National organization, and
can easily act together in withhold
ing loans or extending them, it
follows that they can by united ac
tion in refusing to make loans,
cause a stringency in the money
market and in a single week oreven
in a single day cause a decline in
all the products of the country.
The tremendous possibilities of
speculation involved in this con
trol of the money of a country like
the United States, will be at once
understood by all bankers.
16. National Banks pay no
taxes on their bonds, nor on their
capital, nor on their deposits. This
exemption from taxation is based
on the theory that the capital of
these banks is invested in U.8.
securities, and is a remarkable per
missidn of the law.
17. The Secretary of the Trea
sury may deposit the public money
with any National Bank at will,
anid to ally altlmount. Ill the suit of
Mr. Branit-h against the United
States, relHprtedl in- the 12th, vol
ume of tlW I'. S. Court of Claims
Reports, at page 2S7. it was decid

are rightfully mingled with the
other funds of the bank, and are;
loaned or otherwise empnloyed iu

and, the bank becomes the debtor
of the United States precisely as.
it does to other depositors."
Requesting that you will regard
this circular as strictly confidential
and soliciting any favors in our
line that you may have to extend,
we are.
Most respectfiully yours,

Proposal For Harmony.
The following proposition has
been formulated by the Executivu
Committee of the Populist Party
of the Fourth Cungrersional Dis
trict:
"Be it resolved, That to insure
white supremacy and the election
of a white man's ticket in the 4th
congressional district, the People's
party executive committee of this
district make the following prols
sitions to the Democratic party itn
the fourth congressional district,
to-wit:
:.1. That after the Democratic
party has held its congressional
convention, made its platform and
placed its canlidate thereon, said
candidate and the candidate of the
People's party and their respective
platforms be submitted to the
white primary, in which every
white legal voter in the district
shall be allowed to vote.
"2. That the said primary elec
tion one-half the commissioners
anl officers of same be appointed
from the People's party by the offi
cers of the saute, and the other
half from and by the Democratic
party.
".3. That a commission equally
divided between the two parties
and appointed in the same manner
as the commissioners in section 2,
compile count and decree the vote
from the different parishes and the
result in the district.
,"4. That the candidate success
tul in the primary be declared the
white man's candidate and the de
feated candidate be withdrawn
by his party and his supporters
stand pledged by their vote in said
primary to give their support in
the regular election following said
primary to no candidate who may
be running or who may afterward
run against the nominee of said
primary.
"5. That nothing in this propo
sition or agreement, if accepted, be
in any way construed to influencee
or waver the fealty of the success
ful candidate to his platform or
party when elected.
"'6. That M. F. Machen, J. W.
Brown and S. J. Henry are hereby
appointed by this congressional
executive committee as a special
committee to present this proposi
tion to the Democratic executive
committee, and if accepted to ar
range with that committee or its
representatives the details, date
etc., of said primary."
The representative of the Times
Democrat at Natchitoches, at
which place the Popalist commit
tee met, interviewed Hon. L. Cas
pari, Hon. H. M. Hyams, Jadge
Charles [I. Levy, Attorney-Gener
al Uunmngham, Hon. W. H. Jack
and Mr. B . L CUaspari, and each of
these gentlemen agreed that the
proposition quoted above was fair
and honorabhle, and was a just and
liberal step toward harmonizing
and unifying the white vote. Du
riug the past two years The Item
has advocated the method of ui.
fying our people and forever wipe
out a possibility of two things, viz:
First, danger of republican sapre
macy; second, rape of the ballot to
prevent it. We are glad to me
that our Populist cousins have
come forward in a manly straight
forward manner and opened the
way to bring about harmonious
action. By this plan we are but
bowing to that great Demoeratic
principle, "the will of the majori
ty." By their gallant action oar
Populist friends have shown an
honest desire for harmony among
the white people of the State sad
an honest intention to abide the
result. The Democrats cannot at
ford to be outdone in this respect,
and by all means should mee& the
SPopulists half way. The true in
terests of the State .demand it.
