—Is a militant organization
that is earnestly and effectively
working for the perpetuation oi

ciples, and institutions.

croachments on our national her

corruption as they tight for the

people back to the constitution.
EVERY once in a while I come
across a message that beau
tifully presents an important
lesson of life. Today I found a
sparkling gem that wonderfully
radiates a fundamental theme.
Some unknown philosopher of
modern times gave us the bene
fit of his prospecting when he
opened his mental jewel case: “I
would rather plant a single acorn
that will make an oak of a cen
tury and a forest of a thousand
years, than sow a million morn
ing glories that give joy for a
day an<l are gope » For the same
reason 1 woulu rather plant one
living truth in the heart of a
child that will multiply through
the ages, than scatter a thousand
brilliant conceits before a great
audience that will flash like
sparks for an instant and like
sparks disappear forever.”
A LOVE foy
chastens me grosser ele
ments in our make-up: elevates
the mind beyond the artificiality
now so common; gives us a con
sciousness of (Jod s supreme
greatness; and draws us away
from an over-estimate of things
material.
(tod has spoken to man in word
and picture. He who cannot read
can understand the meaning of
nature's pictures. In the great
outdoors nature proclaims the
power and goodness of Jehovah
so distinctly that every open
mind can understand. He who
has studied deeply the pictures
in (tod's gallery has indeed
learned much.
In the nineteenth Psalm we
read the words that bring forth
a mighty truth: “The heavens de
clare the glory of (tod, and the
firmament showeth his handi
work. Day unto day utteretli
speech and night unto night
sheweth knowledge; there is no
speech nor language where their
voice is not heard.*’
Every one of us ought to tear
away from the common routine
of life, now and then, to feast
on the divine food of nature and
to drink to the dregs the ethe
real spirits of an enchantd fairy
land. The hours will speed like
minutes amidst (<od*s creation.
Some delightful day in sum
mer find your way to a murmur
ing brook and sit quietly for an
hour or more and listen to the
magic words that come from
flowing waters. The joyous songs
of happy birds the chirping of
beetles, the croaking of frogs,
the hum of passing bees, the low
ing of distant cattle. Drink man,
drink as never before in your life
the splendor of the out-of-doors.

MAYOR NELSON DENOUNCES KLAN
SIEGEL SAYS HE WILL
REDUCE CITY TAX RATE
Denies Starting Story That St.
Paul Executive is Member of
Ku Klux Klan
(By TWILIGHT)
The St. Paul mayoralty race
is getting somewhat personal as
it gains momentum. Charges are
flung with a wildness that makes
one wonder about many things
not directly connected with the
issues of the campaign. So far,
Mayor Nelson has been on the
defensive.
The local daily papers are support
ing the mayor for re-election, but
that does not seem to worry the Sie
gel forces in the least. In this con
nection a Siegel man pointed out that
the Saintly City dailies were so far
away from the common people as to
make their support of doubtful value
to any candidate, whether local, state
or national.
Somehow the Klan was injected in
to the mayoralty campaign, and May
or Nelson has felt it necessary to go
far out of his way in order to malign
the great Protestant organization.
When it comes to grandstand tactics.
Arthur E. Nelson takes the cake with
onion filling. In his denunciation of
the Ku Klux Klan Nelson emphasizes
toleration and broad-mindedness. Pol
iticians used the same stuff when Mo
ses wore knee-breeches. To hear the
mayor talk you’d think he’s ashamed
to be a Protestant. Of course Arthur
E. isn’t that, but his public utter
ances go to show what a man will say
in order to win in politics. Read the
following statements as made by the
mayor of the Saintly City, and draw
your own conclusions.
Mayor’s Statement
“There is no place in America for
one who does not believe in the prin
ciples of equality and natural rights
upon which this government is found
ed. The right to life, liberty and
happiness includes absolute religious
liberty, ahd any "at’empt to divide
the American people upon lines of
race, religion or color, is an attempt
to overthrow the principles upon
which the government rests.
“I have already, on several occa
sions. made this statement, but this
seems to be the age of dirty politics,
and so a whispering campaign of vil
ification has been started by my en
emies. and one of the most persistent
and false statements made by them
is that I am a member of the Ku
Klux Klan.
“I believe that my analysis of the
true principles of government was a
sufficient answer to this falsehood,
because membership in that order
would be inconsistent with those
principles, and I don’t believe that
even my enemies say that I am afraid
to tell where I stand; but good
friends of mine have told me that
many well-meaning people have failed
to put the proper construction upon
my utterances and suggest a direct
answer.
“Last night John H. Hickman, a
colored man, who had been an em
ployee of one of the oldest jobbing
firms of this city for 40 years, was
honored at a banquet by the officers
and employees of that great commer
cial concern, and we have had the
spectacle that during a period when
loyalty and honesty and steadfastness
seemed to be weakening, this col
ored man, John H. Hickman, stood out
as the representative of each of those
qualities.
“One of the closest political and
personal friends I have is Carlton F.
McNally, a sincere, loyal, and con
sistent Catholic.
“Upon the district bench of this
city is Judge Charles Bechhoefer, a
Jew, whom I feel honored in calling
my friend, and whose high character
and legal ability fits him for any po
sition in his profession.
“No organization which would bar
such men from every privilege of
public or private life is consistent
with American ideals, and I now state
with as much emphasis as I am ca
pable of. that I am not .a member of
and do not belong to the Ku Klux
Klan or the so-called Invisible Em
pire. and so far as I am informed of
its objects and methods, do not ap
prove it; nor do I belong to or ajv
prove of any organization which
would deny to the men I have men
tioned. and others like them, any
privileges or rights under the law of
this country which I enjoy as an
American citizen.’’
Obviously Mr. Nelson is playing for
the Roman Catholic vote and so is
willing to go on record as opposed to
the world’s greatest Protestant or
ganization, Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan. Evidently the mayor doesn’t
give a whoop for the Protestant vote
of St. Paul. Nelson’s anti-Klan
speeches have no justification what
soever and serve no worthy purpose.
Every Klansman knows that the St.
Paul Mayor is not sincere in his de
nunciations of the Protestant order
Arthur E has worked himself into a
mental state that gives his imagina
tion a recklessness bordering on the
farce-comedy. He talks so much
about “whispering campaigns" that
sometimes 1 think he reully believes
tho buncombe he spills in connection
with these campaigns. Turkish baths

don’t seem to be doing very much
good from all outside appearances.
The Union Advocate in its issue
of April 23. under the title, “A Chas
tened Mayor,” said some things that
hit the political nail squarely on the
head:
“Mayor Nelson is no longer the
cockv city official he was before the
primaries.
“His demeanor aince that occasion
is almost meek.
“Gone is the swagger.
“Gone are the swinging shoulders.
“Even the gavel falls with less of
a resounding smack.
“The humble property owner who
attends city council meetings has his
chance to talk without being cut off.
“Inner office doors are now fre
quently open to the public view.
“A courteous and capable secre
tary now presides over the outer of
fice.
“A look of anxiety has replaced the
arrogance of confidence in the may
or’s face.”
“Verily, adversity has its uses.”
Siegel Presents Himself
At a meeting held in the Odd Fel
lows’ hall, 2710 West Seventh street,
under the auspices of the Ford Dis
trict Commercial club. Mr. Siegel,
the mayor’s opponent, clearly and def
initely presented himself.
“The first thing the mayor did,” said
Siegel, “was to remove from the de
partment of public works the best
man that department ever had. Then
he so dominated that department
* hat its results must be charged to
him. He removed Oscar Claussen as
city engineer despite, the long rec
ord of Claussen as an efficient pub
lic servant. The condition of your
dirty streets is the best evidence of
how that department has functioned.
“Go to the office of the county
treasurer tomorrow,” Siegel shouted,
“call for your statement of taxes and
if you find that your taxes have not
been increased, then do not vote for
me.
You have heard much about these
wonderful improvements; I say to
you that more money has been spent
in the past two years than in any like
period in the city’s history. And
what have you to show for it?” Sie
gel turned to a discussion of the Ford
plant. "This wonderful activity of
the mayor in bringing the Ford plant
to St. Paul,” he said, when he was in
terrupted by a man who shouted:
“The mayor does not claim that.”
“1 have heard him claim it,” Siegel
replied. “Is there any one here who
believes that any one man could go
to Dtroit and persuade Mr. Ford,
hard-headed business man as he is, to
come to St. Paul unless Mr. Ford
wanted to come here because of the
wonderful location provided for his
plant, the water power available and
>ther inducements that were offered?
“This I, me, myself, nobody else
talk,” Siegel added, “is getting tire
some.”

issues involved in the campaign. Sie

CONGRESS GETTING BACK TO
NORMALCYJFTER BICKERING
President Invites Groups of Representatives and Sena
tors to Breakfast Parties and Then Shows Them Big
Stick, Hoping to Speed Up Much Needed Legislation.
Coolidge Wins in Michigan, Which Wa* Carried in Primaries Four
Years Ago by Hiram Johnson—Third Party Possibility Spells Dis
aster to Republieans in Northwest.
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 9.—Washington seems to be getting
back to normalcy, after congress has put in a solid four months
talking without enacting any legislation to speak of. President
Coolidge seems to have started a series of breakfast parties, invit
ing senators and congressmen in small groups to eat bacon and eggs,
pancakes and maple syrup in the White House. It is rumored that
after the breakfast is over the president takes the invited guests
out in the back yard and shows them Teddy’s Big Stick in his ef
forts at speeding up legislation on Capitol hill.
Whatever is done in the way of
legislation must be done in the next
two months if congress is to adjourn
before the political conventions are
held in June. There is talk now that
it will be impossible to adjourn be
fore the national conventions are
held and that congress will be oblig
ed to return to Washington and
spend at least a portion of the hot
summer there. President Coolidge
is making no plans for going away
and rather expects to be here most
of the summer. That will mean a
recess of a few weeks in June to per
mit members of congress to attend
both conventions and then return to
Washington to finish up the job they
have neglected to do in the last four
months.
Taking Up the Tax Bill
The senate has up the tax reduc
tion bill, the Mellon plan and others.
It is predicted that there will be not
less than three weeks spent in this
discussion in the upper branch of
congress. At the same time the sen
ate finance committee is working
away on a bonus bill and that is ex
pected to follow the tax bill.
Senator Pepper. Republican, ot
Pennsylvania, seems to have seasoned
the approaching campaign with some
hot stuff in his recent Maine speech
which the Democrats are insisting
was intended as a keynote speech.
And also with his introduction this
week of a resolution asking the
president to call another internation
al conference or a world court. The
Democrats have hopped onto both
propositions with both feet and are
making things lively for the Pennsyl
vania senator and the Republican
party in general. This is going to
be a warm campaign all right. The
people can make up their minds on
that point right now.
President Gaining
President Coolidge seems to be
some runner and is gaining ground
and delegates, day by day and week
by week. He carried the Michigan
primaries by a big vote notwith
standing the fact that Senator John
son carried that state four years ago
in the primary. And latest reports
from Illinois and Nebraska indicate
that they, too, have jumped into the
Coolidge band wagon. If Senator
Johnson, who is devoting considerable
time to his own state, should hap
pen to lose California, that would be
the unkindest cut of all, and there is
rumor that that very thing may hap
pen. If it does, Senator Johnson
will undoubtedly get out of the race
and the Cleveland convention will
only be a ratification meeting.
But if any nepublican thinks it is
going to be only a ratification affair
next November, let him disabuse his
mind on that point. President Cool
idge, who has never been defeated
yet for '*r\ elective office to which he
has aspired, will have the fight of
his life next November and the Re
publican party, which has gotten in
bad through the national scandals
recently exposed, will have one awful
time squaring itself with the voters
The Democrats are going to charge it
up to Coolidge, and attempt to show
his responsibility and that he has
been in portion aIL the time to know
what has been goj%; on.
Third Party Spocter
The report is gaining ground that
the country is going to have a third
party this year, and that Senator La
Follette is to be its head. That soells
danger for the Republicans in Wis
consin, Minnesota, the two Dakota*
and possibly in Nebraska and lowa.
There is no getting away from the
fact that the Democratic party is
now in a strategic position. All it
lacks is leadership. There are so
many Democratic candidates and the
pnrty is split up into so many crowd*
and factions that it has troubles of
its own. That fact might possibly
save the day for the Republicans.
It is now looking around among its
timber for the purpose of finding
some one who can stir the emotions
of the people, capture the delegates
and run away with the Democratic
nomination. But it is conceded in
Washington hy well informed people
that the party right now lacks hip
leadership and that it is necessary
to find that leadership if success is
to be gained at the polls in Novem

OWATONNA KLAN
GOES TO CHURCH
Fiery Crosses Indicate Open
House Celebration in
Minnesota
OWATONNA, MINN,, April 4.
With the opening of spring, this city
held an open house which attracted
wide attention. The members of the
Owatonna Klan determined not to
be left out and celebrated the event
by burning nine eight-foot crosses,
erecting them at various places
throughout the city. The burning
'■•vmbols of the Klan, witnessed by
thousands who came here from neigh
boring communities to take part in
the Owatonna open house.
Chief of Police Dunnigan, who in
the past has been enthusiastically
kicking down fiery crosses, has final
ly found himself short of feet, al
though still enjoying his cross-top
fding activities. From now on, it
ooks as if the chief won’t have to
worry about police duties.
On Sunday, March 80, members of
the local Klan agreed upon a plan
which will bring a more substantial
support to the Protestant churches.
Klansmen, especially, saw to it that
they did their part individually by
church attendance. Every member
of the Owatonna Klan is urged to
take a keener interest in the work of
the Protestant churches..

The first barge from down river
this season will reach St. Paul about
April 26, according to word reaching
J. A. Osborne, River Transit company
traffic manager Thursday.
It is the barge Hennepin, which left
Memphis about a week ago with an

reached St. I*ouis Wednesday. It re
sumed its northward trip from St.
Louis Saturday.
Meanwhile the barge La Crosse
from St. I*ouis is due Friday in Wi

markings and thus beating the navi
gation season. Somewhere below Wi
nona it is expected to meet the gov
ernment steamer Ellen, which left
Winona Monday, going downstream
with buoys to mark the channel as
far as Rock Island, HI.
The La Cross will start back from
Winona for St. Lottie Saturday with a
good-sized load.

Klan Accused of Crime
Which Was Never
Committed
CLARKSBURG. W VA.. April
15. Feeling ran high and rumors
flew thick and fast when an uni
dentified body was found hanging
from the Stealey bridge here to
night. The Ku Klux Klan was
mentioned in several of the ru
mors. Ant i-Kianspeople were giv
en a shocking surprise, however,
when local police, after carefully
taking the body down, found it
to be a dummy. The police came
to the rescue cf the dummy in
answer to a call stating that a mnn
wa< hanging from the Stealey
bridge. Many persons in discuss
ing the affair prior to the arrival
of the police had advanced so far
as to tell that the “man” was
about 33 years old and other as
tonishing details. The trick is be
lieved to be the work of boys re

KLAN OF LYON COUNTY
PLANS FUTURE GROWTH
Great Change Has Come in Pub
lie Opinion in Regard to
Organization
(By EYKTHKRKI
TRACY, MINN.. April 8. The
Klansmen of this city have carefully
laid their plans for a growth of the
Lyon county Klan which will materi
ally assist in meeting the needs of
this section of the Gopher state.
The increased strength of the Klan
here has already made itself felt in a
way to conclusively prove that unit
ed action can do things for com
munity betterment. People who have
been for some time standing on the
sidelines watchfully waiting are now
seeking membershinp in the Ameri
can organization.
It is surprising indeed to note the
many individuals who made the
“about face” movement and today
f-tand as Klansmen within the ranks.
Not a few who only a few months
ago were misguided by their igno
•ance concerning Klankraft work en
thusiastically for the progress of the
Ku Klux Klan.
Recently plans were completed and
actions accordingly taken which will
mean some real forward strides. Ev
ery member of the local Klan has
definitely decided to put his shoulder
to the wheel and do some real push
ing. We are glad to be able to re
port that we have but few laggards in
our ranks. We now know that noth
ing will stop our growth and natur
ally. therefore, we feel much pleased
as we consider the local Klan situa
tion. We are serving a notice here
and now. to the Klans of the Gopher
state, to look well to their laurels,
for the Lyon county Klansmen mod
estly promise some membership in
creases that will make many sit up
and take notice. We are out after a
record and w’e say it ourselves, as we
shouldn’t, that we’re going to “hit
the ball” in a way to make all North
Star Kluxers feel pleased in the good
old-fashioned way.
Yes, we have some opposition here
but then it’s the same opposition that
all real Americans must contend with
everywhere in the United States, and
we will only work the harder and so
do that much more. ' You can readily
see that the anti’s merely put us on
a more determined basis.
