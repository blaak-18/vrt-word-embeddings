BE GENEROUS WITH YOUR RE
FORM PAPERS.
Dear Sir: —Messrs. J. L. Sapp and
O. P. Sapp have received your knife
and it is highly appreciated. I have
taken the back numbers of your
magazines and weeklies and passed
them on and done much good. I ask
ed an old lady not far from Camilla if
she would like to read something on
Foreign Missions and she said "writ
ten by whom,’’ I said Tom Watson.
She told me that she did not want to
read anything from him, that he had
torn the church to pieces about that
subject already. I persuaded her to
read it and she was so well pleased
that she passed it on to her family.
I was told by one of her son-in-laws
that the literature I gave her was
the means of turning six families the
right way on the Foreign Mission
subject. If every reader of your
Jeffersonians would go to work right
it would not be long before this
country would be ripe for reform.
Yours truly,
O. P. SAPP.

FROM REV. S. J. COREY.
The editorial on “What We Mis
sionaries Concealed’’ is still causing
ferment and turmoil. Read this,
please:—
“Dear Sir: —I have read your ar
ticle in The Jeffersonian of July 15th
based on the presumed statements
of Dr. Wakefield at Crawfordsville,
Ind., some time ago. Dr. Wakefield
has written me concerning the mat
ter. He is also writing you. I trust
you will give place to whiat he says
as readily as you did to the report
which you received concerning his
address. You have given wide pub
licity to a statement which is evi
dently false, and I hope you will do
what is in your power to correct it.
“Truly yours,
“S. J. COREY.

sionary Society.”
As soon as Bro. Paul Wakefield’s
letter arrives it will be hung out to
dry on this clothes line. Hurry up,
Paul. And be careful what you say,
or you’ll get yourself in trouble.
THERE WITH THE GOODS.
Dear Sir: —I feel it my duty, as
well as pleasure, to express my feel
ing of gratitude for the enlighten
ment and knowledge I have gained,
and to know that you have under
taken to set forth some of the evils
connected with our foreign mission
ary affairs, and in my humble opin
ion you have only begun to expose
a very small per cent, of this graft
and fraud connected with the pres
ent system. 1 trust you will not let
up till you expose them so that they
can no longer impose on the unsus
pecting church people of this coun
try, for I have for a number of years
felt that this thing was wrong, but
until you brought out some of the
facts found no way of arriving at
the facts in the case.
I want to state that I have never
seen you take a stand about any
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
matter but what you were “there
with the goods” when they were
called for. You will find thousands
standing with you in this matter and
among them men whom you least ex
pected. I have always admired your
political attitude of standing and
contending fearlessly for the op
pressed. You may never receive your
just appreciation, but your work has
been well done and I hope that your
reward is sure.
In conclusion, let me congratulate
you on your willingness to sacrifice
the good wishes of some of the peo
ple for the truth’s sake. We all
know the Truth is not always popu
lar, and it takes a man with the
courage of his convictions to stand
alone when he knows he is right.
Hoping that you may keep the
searchlight turned on this great
grafting institution, I am,
Your humble servant,
S. F. ROBERTS.

" NICEST CARDS I EVER SAW.
Dear Editor of Jeffersonians: —I
have received my beautiful cards this
a. m., and consider the cards alone
worth more than I gave for them and
both papers. lam obliged to say that
they were the nicest cards I ever saw.
Please notify, me in time before my
subscription expires, and I will renew
—of course I will.

HITS THE FOREIGN MISSIONS
FANATICS.
Dear Sir: —I have been reading
with a great deal of amusement the
roast that you are giving the for
eign mission cranks that they de
serve and you are handling the sit
uation beautifully. I would like to
add only one suggestion, and that is
this: whenever you begin to argue
with the fanatics here, they always
cite you to the fact that those who
give the most to foreign missions
give the most to home missions, and
then set back with a heavenly smile.
Now, the fact is that a stingy man
doesn’t give any money to anything,
and the liberal man gives to every
thing, just in proportion and divides
up just as his preacher tells him to,
without giving one thought to the
matter, and this is just what you are
trying to do to arouse public con
science.
Let the good work go on; we are
with you. There are hundreds of
children in North Georgia who have
got just as much sense as you and I,
who have not one cent spent on
them.
Very truly yours,
JOHN L. JOHNSON.
Cartersville, Ga., Sept. 2, 1909.
GOOD SUGGESTIONS FROM A
COMRADE.
Dear Sir: —I always look in the
weekly Jeffersonian for those letters
that suggest ways and means for
uniting reformers. I would like to
suggest a few things.
First. A heart-to-heart and face
to-face talk with one another by these
"Glje Jeffersonian
six or seven leaders: Watson (to call
the conference), Bryan, Debs, Hearst,
La Follette and Gompers, or Mitchell,
or both. Include Bryan? Yes! For
the basis of union, the only one to
take, would be the Initiative and
Referendum and Recall, and Bryan
would then have to show his true
colors. If he would not consent to
such Democratic platform, all re
formers would know where to put
him, and if he did consent, he’d burst
the Democratic machine and the plu
tocrats could then unite it perma
nently where they have it attached
anyhow—with the Aldrichian Oligar
chy—when the “Big Business” in
ests need votes in Congress and legis
latures.
Second. If direct legislation can be
made the basis of action by these
above-named leaders (or some of
them), then a general conference
should be called to which should be
invited our great magazine writers,
like Charles Edward Russell, David
Graham Phillips, Lincoln Steffens and
B. O. Flower—and, perhaps, one or
two dozen others; for the pens of
such writers will be necessary in the
coming struggle, which must be
made, to unhorse the Cannon-Al
drich cohorts.
Third. Let this conference of
thinkers prepare a tentative platform
with the Initiative and Referendum
and Recall as the center and basis,
providing that all other questions of
great importance shall be submitted
to the people to enact into legislation
according to the Initiative and
Referendum principle,—this, it seems
to me, would unite all reformers and
require no one to sacrifice any of his
convictions; for by Direct Legisla
tion he would have the opportunity
to vote for or against certain pro
posed measures—and the majority
would rule—the majority of the
people, instead of the machinations
of the politicians.
Fourth. Call for independent can
didates in every Congressional dis
trict next year and let these candi
dates make their campaign on the
basis of this conference report, plat
form, or plan, as it may be called.
This will give a following with which
to lay the foundation for a more thor
ough organization for the 1912 bat
tle—yes, “battle;” for reformers
must unite till then, and once uni
ted they will need to fight, and
“Bryan’s First Battle” will be tame
in comparison.
Fifth. The name of the party is
immaterial from one viewpoint; for
example, look at the name “Demo
crat”—what does it signify today—
everything and nothing! Yet, we
must be known by some name that
will signify a determined and definite
purpose and that will appeal to the
average voter. The word Populist
suggests a dead movement in the
popular mind, but Populist issues
are alive—the fundamental doctrine
of Direct Legislation, then the I. R.
and R. is populistic, democratic, in
deed and in truth, and verily becom
ing more popular—among men of all
parties. Hence it is the one issue
that will unite all followers of the
reform flag. But the name should
be something like this: “Progressive”
“Radical.” The Referendum Party
would sound all right, too, for the
politicians would have to refer all
legislation of great importance to the
people for their indorsement.

Stanardsville, Va., July 26, 1909.
FOR TRUE SELF-GOVERNMENT.
If we want ours to be a govern
ment of, for and by the people, not
in theory, but in practice, then give
the people the power to direct legis
lation and the execution of the laws.
If their officers fail to perform the
services for which they are chosen,
the people should have the power to
make them quit, like they did in Los
Angeles, when they compelled the
Mayor to step down and out. To wait
until the next election gives the bad
official too much time for mischief.
Let the people have the recall and
some officers will abdicate by letting
them.
In a word, it is admitted that our
people are capable of self-govern
ment, and if so, give them self-gov
ernment. Let them try it out. Many
times they have been betrayed by
their representatives. Give us the
initiative, the referendum, and the
recall, and public servants will soon
be made to understand that they are
simply hired men instead of bosses.
Strip them of their arrogant dignity.
Make them work and earn their
bread. Do away with the political
drones in public life who take ad
vantage of their position by posing
as great statesmen and jurists when
their qualifications are not even skin
deep.

PARTY POLICY.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —I once read
a Populist book entitled “Whither
Are We Drifting as a Nation”? and
the question applies now to us as a
party. Active Socialists here tell me
the Populist vote of Texas has not
gone to them, but is still out in the
brush.
I do not believe that any honest,
loyal Greenbacker or Populist wishes
to take a backward step. That they
will echo Col. Felter’s appeal in‘the
June 17th Jeffersonian. Couldn’t you
devote one page of the weekly to let
ters under the caption of Reorganiza
tion, thereby getting our people to
gether in a weekly forum and avoid
ing unnecessary expense attending a
conference, thus arousing interest
and support, and these letters to be
edited by two men of Mr. Frank E.
Richey’s caliber, along these lines:
1. Need of Populist position.
2. Insistence on party integrity and
loyalty.
3. Enlisting young blood to work.
4. Finance.
5. Campaign.
Keeping our lines clear cut and dis
tinct and no slopping over into the
two old parties at one end and Social
ism at the other. Not to sit on the
fence waiting for some band wagon
to get into.
Yours sincerely,
F. FORRESTER.

All letters welcome and Jefferson
ian Club work begun.
We are devoting several pages a
week to letters, and as even this
space is limited when so many are
to be heard from, The Jeffersonian
requests each correspondent to write
briefly and to the point. Often a
simple “I endorse the plan of Mr.
Blank” will suffice, if you approve
a plan that has already been fully
outlined; or “I endorse Mr. Blank’s
plan, with the exception”, etc. By
writing short letters, everybody will
get a prompt hearing in the popular
forum.
