TURN THE CATHODE RAYS ON IT.-From Cleveland Press.
WE WILL WIN YET.
CAPITAL IS OPPRESSIVE, BUT
THE PEOPLE SEE.
"Whatever We Do We Must Not Compro
mise With the Plutocratic Npirit of the
Age"-L-eehes and Profligates, Beggars
and Trampe-Some Prophecy.
The following startling words from
one secure in a safe and exalted posi
tion, are taken from a recent letter:
"I fear social reform has begun too
late and is moving too slowly to avert
a revolution. Capital is becoming ar
rogant, heartless and insolent; labor is
turning to despair and desperation with
a cumulative velocity that none of us
fully appreciate. May God help us to
hasten a peaceful evolution. Never
theless revolution is better than the
continuously increasing injustice that
grinds the masses down into that
loathsome poverty that brutalizes body
and soul.
"Whatever we do, we must not
compromise with the plutocratic spirit
of the age. The accursed system of
competition and monopoly is grinding
out leeches and profligates at one end
of the social mill ind shriveled bog
gars and tramps at the other end.
"The facts are appalling, a few hun
dreds of millionaires and multi-million
sirs, on one side, while thousands of
children have no home but the streets,
sand so room in the public schools, in
evitably to become tramps and vaga
bonds, on the other side of the social
ale.
"One clothing company of our city
reports a yearly profit of over $150,000;
ackk of that the discouraged farmers
who produce the raw material, the
waa faces, shabby clothing and com
fortles homes of the weavers and spin
ascr, and the diseased, half naked,
.starving victims of the sweat shops;
these are the back grounds of the fine
picture of the year's profitable busines
of the thrifty company.
"Neither human nor divine justice
can grant any approval to a system
that yields such results. Yet these
eeditlons to a greater or less degree
prevail in all our large cities."
Thus writes a friend from one of our
large cities, whp froem his eminent and
sfe position pictares with earnest
wrds the awful conditions that are so
rear us

1- "I never ge jp to give my seat In
the 'L' cars at night," says Thompeon.
e "Why should I? I am as tired as any
of those blamed women, and I pay m
five cents for a seat--If I can get one.
Thompson was wrapped in his paper
the other evening, with a crowd of peo
ple standing along the aisle, looking at
him enviously as he leaned back in his
e seat. It was snowing hard, and many
ir of the passengers were wet. Immedi
ately In front of Thompson stood a tall
g girl, with a mischievous gleam in her
r, eyes and a hat with a brim turned up
at the sides on her head. She wanted
's Thompson's seat, but she could see
t. there was little ch ace of getting it.
e "I'll let him knot *'m here, anyhow,"
she said to the girl with her, with a sly
I smile.
Thompson was deep in his paper, and
appeared to be unconscious of the pres
ence of the girl, although she stepped
upon his foot and rustled his paper with
the bottom of her wrap. Then she took
damper measures. The snow in the
e hollow brim of her hat had melted, and
she bent over Thompson, so that a
n stream of water ran upon his paper and
e emptied itself into his vest pocket.
Thompson uttered a prayer for the
innocent young girl, and then she
n turned the other side to him, so that
II the water from the opposite side of her
t hat would go down to the paper.
a "Slash-squizzle-dumfounder, what
the-bells-an'-blazes!" yaped Thompson,
Involuntarily, as he leaped from his
teat.
l- "Oh, don't let me deprive you of your
d teat. You must be tired!" purred the
r, demure maiden, as she winked again
at her friend, with the eye that was
1, furthest away from Thompson. But
Thompson never looked at her as she
Idropped into his seat with a sigh of
it ontent.-New York Press.

One of these is known as maraschino
punch and is prepared in the following
aiaanner: Select as many large oranges
rgs the number of guests require, and
irepare them by giving each one a
Iransveree cut, about half an inch from
Sbihe top. The interior and this sliced
part also are then nicely scooped out
d rnd the pulp Is pressed into a sieve until
i he juice Is all extracted. This is
sweetened to taste and weakened wits
" p. little water, until a strong orangeade
t is made. Into this is finally poured a
c uflcient quantity of maraschino to
Itnsvor the mixture agreeably, and the
empty oranges are filled with it. Two
y straws are then prettily tied to the tops
by narrow ribbons drawn through two
C punctures. These ribbons must match
a the other decorations of the table, and
harmonize as well with the color of the
cranges themselves. When the cap is
Sfitted again they are ready for serv
