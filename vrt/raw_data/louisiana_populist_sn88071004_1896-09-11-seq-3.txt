an!'s anxiety to get the S:lp;ul - of
1ohlbtug t mlt.tiorat-, 'who i ' s-'1'n1
foes of silver and th!.t (hic'.a.:, pl:A- t
form, is discouragian to thel p:pu
lists, who do( not prolpo)se to Imake
common cause with their wor.;t en
emy. Mr. Butler plainly intio
mates that the populists cannot ex
pect any good from a camp-'iign or
an administrati:n nmanagedl or in
fluenced by Hlill or Gorman, and
he does not see what good will
come to the country by making
Hill and Gorman cd'binet othccr
with a pledge to support Iill for
the presiden.:y four years hence.
Inother words. " Mr. Butler is a
straight-forward outspoken man
who does not look for success fromiu
courting the enemies (;f silver.
He knows that Hill, Gorman,
Whitney and all their set are bit
terly opposed to the Chicago plat
form, and he knows that they will
not support it except through sin
ister and corrupt motives. lie
knows nothing but promises of
power and the hope of ultimately
defeating every doctrine in the Chi
cago platform can induce Hill to
support Bryan. Therefore he ar
gues that it is ~adl policy to endeav
or to carry New York at the sac
rifice of every principle we are
fighting for, and he warns the
denibcrats that the populists
are not going to be led into
a trap. They will not put their
necks in a goldbug noose sim
ply to get the spoils. Mark that.
It may suit so-called free silver
democrats to turn this country over
to the goldbut brethren in order to
get in, but they must not expect
the populists to stultify themselves
for goldbug crumbs.
We say hurrah for Butler.
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
Of People's Party Clubs.
Washington. D. C. September 2 '96.
Political Olub organization has
proven one of the most effective ad
juncta to oampaign Wrork that has
ever been devised. The present
dampaign has brought into exis
Stence more club than any otner
known in the history of the coun
-try, The People's l'arty must not
-lag behind the procession. There
should be a People's Party Clab in
every township in America and,
)where the party is strong, in every
Isbool district. There bshould be
one in each village, and in eacb
city clubs should be organised by
Swards. These clubs can be not on
E ly am important help in the pres
r ent campaign, bat they can also be
a permanent good to the party.
Here is the plan: Let each
f State Committee recommend

.throgh the regular party organi
satrion, the startuing of Populist
SCOlabe in every precinct in the
SItate. No organisers are necemsa
Sry for ts, ialthough State and

The chair appointed a committee
of five on resolutions, which re
ported as follows:
"Be it resolved, 1. That we in
(horse the tplatform adopted by the
National People's Party Conven
tion at St. Louis, and p1(ledge our
hearty support to its nominees,
lrvt " and Watson.
"2. That we reaffm in the most
emphatic manner our advocacy of
the free coinn'ey of silver and gold
at the ratio of 16t to 1, without
waiting for the aid, advice or co
operation of any other nation, and
we believe that such free coinage is
necessery to the restoration of pros
perity.
"3. That we favor an alliance
with the D)emocrats of Louisiana
at the ensing natinal electional election for
the purpose of carrying this State
for Bryan ant Watson ; and we
express the utmost confidence in
the competency, wisdom and pat
riotism of the properly constituted
aathority of our party to deal with
this question.
"4. That we indorse free speech
and honest elections as the cardi
nal priples of free g, overnment,
with equal rights to all and special
privileges to none.
The above resolutions were unan
imously adopted.
On motion the convention weont
into nominations.
Richard A. Pomeroy excused
himself from the chair and placed
the name of Judge A. C. Allen
before the convention for the nom
ination for Congress, which was
duly seconded, and after a general
discussion a vote was taken by ac
clamation andl was unanimous.
SThe followinf resolutions wtere
r then adopted :
th1. e present to the voters of
the Third Congressional Distr ct
Sour nominee, Judge A, C. Allen,
- not as a Populist, but as a free sil
Sver man, with broad and liberal
views, with the ability ant patlriot
ia sm to maintain them in all capaci
ties and upon all occasions, and a
i man whom we believe to be strong
aenough to rise above partisan bias
t and -represent the mn.sses of the
Speople, and a man upon whom all
parties in this district can unite to
I support, and in whom they" cn re
pose the fullest confidence.
. **2. We empower our congres
sional district ccionmmittee to fill va
Scancies it the committee and on
a the ticket, and do anything the
a convention might do when in sea

A committee of thrde was ap

Ir HELL, August 2), 1S91.
SSenator James K. .Jones-Dear
e Brother Jones: I must write you
t- to tell you how much I value and
d appreciate y(ur work in my behalf.
h Thit was a lbrilliant move you made
b ith the Populists, getting them to
tnominate Bryan instead of one of
ttheir own imenl. That will knock
l the stuffin' out of them. If we
can ever get them in the Demo
cratic party once they will be so
razzle-dazzled that they can't find
their way out. If some of the
smart leIders undertake it we'll
head them off with an office. The
( Populists were giving me lots of
Strouble and I did not know wnat
to do with them until you haited
s them over into the dtiemocratic plar
Ity. heoll and its interests are in
no danger from any one that we
can iet to join the democratic par
e ty. Now you want to go right on
anl cramn Scwall down the Popl -
lists' throats. Don't pay any at
tention to Watson, he's a crank.
Say, Jones, I want to give you a
1 tip: Bryan won't hie elected. Of
Scourse you know this as well as 1
(10. You know you tried to carry
'- Ohio and Kentucky last year on
a the silver question and got knock
ged higher'n a kite. But you want
to go right o and work just the
same as if Bryan was going to be
11 elected. You will he elected from
to Arkansas. Arkansas belongs to
mne and the democrats and I'll see
that you go bhck to the Snitte.
Tue platform that you ndoptAd at
Chicago and the nomination of Bry
an will save the democratic party
which old Grover had asout pul
verized. Grover is a bully god
follow. but he moved things a lit
of tie too fast. Ilo wanted to get it
all done and turn the whole dad
- gasted thing over to me for a
e. branch hell before his term expir
as ed. This was his only fault. I
w like him about as well as 1 do John
le- Sherman, but he aint half sa smart.
Cs I'll have to depend on you to get
5. things bark in line. ~oui want to

sorb the P'opulists into the de.mo

the Southern Populists, Abuse

don't care what you promise so
