PUBLIC OPINION
Refleeted in the Papers of this
Great State.
We were told in 1892 that the
defeat of the lottery and S. D.
McEnery were necessary in order
to put down ring rule and to pu
rify politics in Louisiana. The lot
tery was driven out and McEnery
was defeated, and still we hear the
charge cont;naally made that our
State government is corrupt. We
didn't believe all that was charged
in x89a, neither do we believe all
of the accusations of to-day. Ring
rule, fraud and corruption seem to
be an effective weapon with which
to assault the party and faction in
power.-Catahoula News, Dem.
The Janvier crowd of citizens in
New Orleans are noted for their in
termeddling propensities, and they
are at present endeavoring to run
the Orleans levee board. The
board has succeeded in squelching
them, but they will pop out in some
other place soon. It's a little
strange that the august Janvier has
not forwarded orders to McKinley
relative to Federal appointments in
the flood threatened metropolis.
Iberville South, Dem.
We havq had occasion to
animadvert severely against Meyer,
Davey And Broussard for perfidy to
the Democratic party, for voting
for this Republican and anti-Demo
cratic measure, but we cannot con
ceive it possible that Sam McEnery,
who has been honored by the Dem
ocratic party of Louisiana beyond
any other man in public life since
the war and who owes whatever of
honorable political preferment he
has attained to the partiality of
that party, will deliberately betray
the trust which has been reposed in
him by a confiding constituency,
by recording his vote in favor of a
measure calculated to destroy any
semblance of returning prosperity,
and nullifying every sacred tradition
and principle of Democracy,
handed down to us by the immor
tal founder of the party, Thomas
Jefferson. When the final vote on
the passage of this robber tariff is
taken we hope and believe that the
name of Sam McEnery will be re
corded on the negative with that of
Don Caffery. He has been
weighed in the scales of official life
many times and has never yet been
found wanting. We cannot con
ceite it possible that this noble old
Roman of Democracy will for the
first time in a long, useful and
honbrable political career, sacrifice
every cherished principle of the
party -to gain fleeting popularity
with a few hundred sugar planters
of Louisiana. -Alexandria Demo
crat, Dem.
It has been established time and
again that principle-party princi
ple-must be preserved inviolate
and paramount to interest, personal
or collective, if party organization
1s to- be preserved and perpetuated.
The very moment it is conceded
that a party leader and representa
tive chosen because of his avowed
faith in party principles as his
guide of action, can become the
instrument of interests and the indi
vidual interpreter of his line of ac
tion, even to the extent of betraying
his party and slapping it in the face
by joining its enemies, then there is
an end to organization which is re
solved into independentism. Such
method betrays and ignores his con
stituents as a party and makes a
fraction greater than the whole.
.It. won't do.-Shreveport Times,
Dem.
In the meantime those gold-bug
journals that are cutting up such
antics because Congressmen Brous
sard, Meyer and Davey saw fit to
vote for the Dingley Bill might
spend their time more profitably in
trying to rid themselves of their
monometallic predelictions, that
they may occupy the prodigal's seat
at the Democratic feast in Igoo; or
else remain with the Palmer and
Bucknet crowd and try to figure out
some way through which their
peculiar political aggregation can
gain recognition as belligerents in
the lost cause they are so vigorous
ly but hopelessly espousing-a re
cognition they failed to win at the
last election although backed by all
the power of a repudiated adminis
tion.-Houma Courier, Dem.
The trouble with the Republicans
is that they have been during the
last campaign too lavish with their
promises and predictions of good
times. All that was required said
they to the voters, was to defeat
free silver and "anarchism," and
shattered confidence would at once
be restored, and the glad smile of
prosperity would at once light up
the land and fhill with joy the hearts
Ot the inhabitants thereof.-St.
Mary Banner, Dem.
At a meeting of prominent citi
"zens of New Orleans held on SGun
day last for the purpose of devising
measures to effectua:ly protect the
city from overflow, one of the
speakers openly pronour ced him
self in favor of having the levees on
fhe Jefferson parish side cut to re
lieve the pressure of the water
leans side, and his view of the.
matter was coincided with by a
large number of those present. We
know what to expect from a set of
thieves and robbers. Commer
cially the people of the country
have been filched and have been re
duced almost to a condition of beg
gary, in order that the metropolitan
parasites might roll in luxury, and
the thief does not hesitate at mur
der when his personal safety hangs
in the balance.-Iberville South,
r Dem.
There is Nothing So Good.

Dr. King's New Discovery for con

mand it and do not permit the
dealer to sell you some substitute.
t He will not claim there is anything
better, but in order to make more
profit he may claim something else
to be just as good. You want Dr.
King's New Discovery because you
know it to be safe and reliable, and
guaranteed to do good or money

SENATOR CAFFER Y AND
THE NE W SOUTH.
New Orleans Picayune.
At the dinner of the New York Reform
Club, at the Waldorf Hotel, on Saturday
night, there was a grand gathering of the
great men who are standing for the Demo
cratic party, for Democracy unadulterated
by the socialism of the Populists and by the
centralism of the Republicans.
Among the speakers were Grover Cleve
land. John G. Carlisle, William L. Wilson,
William D. Bynum, Donelson Caffery,
Josiah Patterson and others of the old guard
of the Democracy. Mr. Cleveland's brave
and hopeful words have been already
printed in the Picayune. Senator Caffery's
eloquent speech, which had been delayed
in transit, is given elsewhere this morning.
Senator Caffery spoke for the New South.
The only New South is that which was the
old, changed only by time and stress of
f storm, and new only as to those changes.
",The New South," said Senator Caffery,
"is the old South, with a new superstruct
ure. The old form of government, the old
virtue and patriotism, the old manhood and
womanhood, survive to-day, as they were
when the first gun was fired on Sumter.
"By flawless title, the new is the inheritor
of all that was great, noble, liberty-founded
and liberty-loving in the old Sonth.
"*The radical difference between the old
and the new is the substitution of freedom
for slavery. The change was painful and
bloody, but it has placed the New South in
line with the highest claims of hunu:nity,
ands the true principles of political economy.
It has caused the new to spring from the
as.hes of the Old South with greater pros
perity and power. The New South stands
on the threshold of the great future, open
ing to her resources and energies, with
courage in her heart and confidence on her
brow."
Nothing could be better said and nothing
is more true of the South to-day. The New
South is the Old South with its later and
greater growth. The South was ever in the
past the home of Democratic liberty. May
it ever be so to the end of time, for Demo
cratic liberty is immortal, and it must ever
have a home among men while there are
men upon the earth.
