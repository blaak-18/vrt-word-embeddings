COMPETYITIVE EXAMINA
TION OF TEA CIERS.
According to a resolution of the
parish School Board adopted last
fall, the public school teachers of
this parish must undergo every year
a competitive examination for their
respective positions in all instances
where two or more applications are
filed for the same school. The
resolution in question is based upon
Sec. 74 of the school laws providing
that "whenever two or more
teachers apply for the same posi
tion or positions a competitive ex
amination shall be held, and the
position or positions shall be given
to the most competent."
In a most eloquent and able
address at Falk's hall, last
Thursday evening, Prof. R. L.
Himes, State institute conductor,
took occasion to touch upon this
point in answer to a query.
The distinguished professor pro
ceeded to show the manifest injus
tice and absurdity of subjecting
faithful and competent teachers to
the worry and trouble of a com
petitive examination with any shift
less character actuated by malicious
or selfish motives, in applying.
The spirit and evident intent of the
State law, said Prof. Himes, is that
competitive examinations shall be
held only where several teachers
apply for an unoccupied position
and does not theretore contemplate
throwing open wide the doors to an
indiscriminate and unseemly scram
ble for every position within the
gift of the Board.
The opinion expressed carries
weight and conviction as coming
from one whose thorough acquain
tance and extended information re
specting educational matters in this
State, entitles him to the just con
sideration of all intelligent and fair
minded citizens. The argument is
reinforced by the manifest purpose
of the law to provide good and
competent teachers and so soon as
this end is subserved all that the act
ever contemplated has been accom
plished. The application of the
strict letter of the law, as adopted
by the Board, would be as un
reasonable as unfair, and would
prove a most potent factor in dis
turbing that stability and perma
nency of character so essential to
any successful advancement.
"Hold fast to that which Is good"
as a motto peculiarly applicable.
The Gazette would not for a mo
ment be understood as endeavoring
to shield incompetent teachers from
a fate they so richly deserve, i. e.,
summary removal from a profes
sion too high and holy to be dis
graced by their sacrilegious hands.
The position taken is that it is the
Board's province, aye, its duty, to
see that every school in the parish
is properly conducted and that the
teachers exercise moral and eleva
ting influences on the minds of the
children entrusted to their care and
training. The Board should thor
oughly acquaint itself with the con
ditions and progress of every school,
and, if any teacher is found dere
lict inl duty, no resort need be made
to competitive examinations, but he
should forthwith be dismissed from
the service and some good teacher
submitted.
Buatso Jong as a teacher faith
fully and conscientiously performs
his duty, giving entire satisfaction
)to patrons as well as officials, The
Gaiette cannot recognize the ne
cessity, or comprehend the object,
an submitting the position to com
petitive examination. Intellectual
capacity, vast knowledge and nor
mal courses are not to be despised,
but do not con: Stute, by far, all the
qualifications which enter into the
composition ot a true teacher. The
highest and most important test
consists in adaptability to the work,
integrity of character and moral tit
ness. Stiange indeed, that the low
est and most uncertain standard
should obtain to the almost exclu
sive ignoring of the highest and
most commonsense test of the peda
gogical qualification.
In offering the above suggestions
and expressions of its views, The Ga
zette would disclaim any motive to
reflect upon the officials or teachers;
nor should any person construe this
article as an attempt at dictation.
This journal has no axe to grind,
no selfish interests to subserve, but
it is actuated solely by a sincere de
sire to promote the educational wel
fare of this parish in particular, and
of the State in general.
THE NORMAL.
Another Week of Hard Work
Visit of Prof. Himes.
During the past week the Sum
mer Normal has done some excel
lent work. Profs. Smith, Keeny,
Trudeau, and Miss Lewis have dis
played the same ability and in
terest which characterized their
work the first and second weeks of
the session. These efficient
teachers are thoroughly qualified
institute workers and all who had
occasion to attend the exercises
were impressed with the intelligent
manner in which they were con
ducted.
Monday State Institute Con
ductor Himes gave the teachers the
benefit of his very valuable assist
ance. Owing to the illness of a
child at his home in Natchitoches
Prof. Himes remained only until
Wednesday, but during his necessa
rily limited stay he delivered three
lectures which were characteristical
ly able, clear and instructive. His
address at Falk's Opera House
Monday night was highly appreci
ated by the teachers as well as by
all others who heard It. It was
forcible, eloquent and practical.
Prof. Keeny's remarks were well
considered, clearly delivered, in
teresting and instructive. Mr. and
Mrs. George Melchoir contributed
largely to the success of Monday
night's meeting.
Among the visitors to the insti
tute this week were Editor Lawton
of the Iberia Enterprise and Dr.
Clarence Pierson, school superin
tendent of that parish, and Rabbi
Rosenspitz of Alexandria. The
latter made a few remarks which
were much appreciated by the
teachers.
Friday morning Capt. Taylor of
Crowley was a visitor to the school.
Capt. Taylor was a teacher for a
long number of years, having been
principal of the Crowley High
School. He is now on the editorial
staff of the Crowley Signal and it is
in the interest of that splendid jour
nal that he visited the institute.
It will be seen from the following
names shat the class was largely
increased during the past week:
Misses Mary Rader, Frances S.
Greig, Lizzie and Clye Mudd,
Kate Rand, M. L. Bagnal, Gertrude
E. Abbott, Anna Campbell, Lelia

AT SCOTT
News Items Picked Up by The Gazette
Correspondent.
Miss Bella Judice of Brookhaven,
Miss., Chas. Delhomme of Mont
gomery, Ala. and Eli Foreman of
Lexington, Ky., returned home last
week. They have been attending
school at the above places.
Chas. Delhomme has been en
gaged by the J. Steckler Seed Co.
of New Orleans, and will take his
new position in a few days.
Dr. Wadlington left last week for
Winona, Miss., and we regret to
hear of his being on the sick list.
Mr. Willie Price is on the sick
list and we hope to see him around
soon.
Mr. A. Trahan is a hustler when
it comes to subscriptions for church
funds. We hope to see the several
lists out filled as well.
Mr. A. Judice has donated a
large tract of land for the erection
of the new church. The people
should appreciate such a gift from
a man who has the future welfare
of Scott at heart and is pushing the
wheel along, and will do all he can
to make Scott a good size town.
At a meeting of the Church As
sociation last Saturday, the gift of
Mr. A. Judice was accepted and a
vote of thanks tendered the donor.
It was decided to give a grand fair
and concert on July 24 and 25.
We pray the good folks will give us
a helping hand.
Mr. Boudreaux of Centreville is
among us. He is employed at the
large Price Emporium.
While at Rayne last Sunday we
had the pleasure of meeting a great
many of our friends and also ob
served that Rayne was taking the
lead in the way of large and fine
buildings.
Mr. I)elhomme has commenced
work on the switch extending to his
new cotton gin. ORTON.
As a result of the game at Lake
Charles, Jin Marsh is nursing a
sprained hand. But Jim says that
Sunday he will be in proper shape
to help do up the Washington boys.
FARMERS' INSTITUTE
Will be Held Thursday, June
24, at Falk's Opera House.
Through the efforts of Major J.
G. Lee, state commissioner of
agricultural, there will be held at
Lafayette, Thursday, June 24, a
Farmer's Institute, in connection
with the Summer Normal school.
All live and progressive farmers
should not fail to attend and induce
as many of their neighbors to do
likewise. Lectures and discussions
of all matters affecting agricultural
interdsts will be delivered by some
of the most successful and scientific
farmers of the State. Advanced
methods along agricultural lines
will be presented and submitted for
general discussion. The advisa
bility of introducing the study of
agriculture in some practical form,
into the common school system, is
now being seriously considered and
that distinguished educator, Prof. B.
C. Caldwell, of Natchitoches, has
consented to address the institute
upon the subject.
Nine-tenth of our boys remain on
the farm and should have some
scientific knowledge of their busi
ness in life. Prof. Stubbs, Dr.
Dalrymple, Hon. John Dymond
and ot.er well-known speakers will
be present. Prof. Smith, of the
Normal, and several local speakers
will also discuss pertinent subjects.
A special feature of the institute will
be the presence of a veterinary
surgeon who wdl give valuable
advice to all interested in stock.
The meeting will open at 9
o'clock in the morning, and a night
session will very likely be held.
THE DIXIES
Came Back Home Defeated But
at Not Subdued.
The Dixies went to Lake Charles
last Sunday and lost the game.
But considering the difficulties un
der which they played we are not
stretching the truth in stating that
the boys scored a decided victory,
though the score tells a different
tale. With three of its best players
less, a maimed catcher and an un
broken chain of hard luck, it is no
wonder that the Dixies allowed the
Calcasieu pine knots, known as the
illustrious Grays, to get away with
their justly-earned laurels. The
Lake Charles Press, in a mild at
tempt at humor, remarks that at
no stage of the game did Lafayette
stand the remotest chance of win
ning. Of course not. The Lafa
yette boys were aware of that stub
born fact. They knew it before
the game began. But they had
agreed to play and they fulfilled
their obligation. However, the
game has established one thing, and
that is the ability of the Dixies to
literally wipe the earth with the
Grays and this teat they propose to
perform if the latter will only afford
them an opportunity. If suitable
arrangements can be made the near
future will disclose the information
as to whether The Gazette is talk
ing through its hat or not.
The score is as follows:

UNFORTUNATE
Condition of a Railroad Man at
Houma.
Sheriff Broussard received the
following letter last Monday from
Sheriff Connelly, of Houma, who
desires some information relative to
the identity of a man who, it ap
pears, is known around the Southern
Pacific depot. The letter reads:
HoUMA. La., June £4, 1897.
Isaac A. Broussard, Esq., Lafa
yette, La.: I have in jail a party
named Walter Conners, about 35
years old, dark complexion, hair
and mustache, about 6 feet, has
lost first finger of right hand. He
was wondering around Chacahoula
station on Southern Pacific Rail
road in a demented condition, I
think brought on by excessive
drink. He had a bill from a hotel
in Houston, Texas, dated June 3,
showing a partial payment. He
claimed to have been a brakeman
on train from Lafayette to Houston,
and seems to know you and your
town marshal and other parties in
Lafayette, but I can get nothing
definitc out of him. Can you give
me any information about the man ?
If you can you will much oblige
Yours truly,
A. W. CONNELY.
Conners is known by the em
ployes at the Southern Pacific
yards, but nothi,'g could be ascer
tained concerning him aside from
the fact that he is from Houston.
We learn that he has been sent to
the Chairity H-lospital, where he
now Is.
