THE YELLOW PERIL.
R. Andrews.
There is no real ground of fear
To us who live far over here
In these United .States.
No dread alarm that we may be
( rushed by the heathenish 'Chinese,
Or smashed by Nippon’s hates.
I
Between two oceans wide we stand;
A great gulf laves our southern land,
And we feel safe, somehow.
Our men and guns are our defence,
And our resources are immense;
We fear no nation now.
Os what is there to be afraid?
“The Yellow Peril,’’ some have said;
That is a truth well told:
For trusts, monopolies and graft
Have run our people nearly daft:
Our YAdlow Peril’s GOLD!
TO MAKE CREAM PUFFS.
In making cream puffs, boil one
cup hot water and one-quarter cup of
butter till the butter is melted. Take
from fire and add one cup of sifted
flour in which has been put one tea
spoonful of baking powder. Stir un
til a sort of ball is formed of the
dough. Set aside to cool while beat
ing four eggs. Add eggs and beat
dough steadily for five minutes. One
tablespoonful makes a puff. Bake
for 20 minutes in moderate oven. To
make the filling use one pint of milk,
four tablespoons of sugar, two table
spoons of cornstarch, two eggs. Cook*
in double boiler until thick. Any
flavoring desired may be used. —Un-
ion Advocate.
HOUSEHOLD HINTS.
In warm weather put eggs in cold
water and they will froth better.
To prevent pastry from burning set
a pan of water in the oven while it
is baking.
Never try to ice a cake hot and let
layer cake get nearly cold before put
ting together.
Always use lard to grease your
cake pans, as the salt in the butter
causes it to stick to the pans.

Any one who has tried to keep a
velvet hat or frock clean does not
need to be told it is a dust collector.
This trying trait may be turned to
account.
A bit of velvet is a fine polisher
for brass. It quickly removes the
dust from woodwork or shoes soiled
from walking which do not need re
blacking.
To remove old paint wet the place
with naphtha, repeating as often as
necessary; but frequently one appli
cation will dissolve the paint. As
soon as it is softened, rub the sur
face clean.
This session of congress has been
the most extravagant congress ever
convened, having appropriated more
than $1,000,000,000 in one single ses
sion, and of this enormous expendi
ture of the people’s money, over
$4,000,000 was appropriated for the
support of the military arm of the
government, while less than $12,000,-
000 has been appropriated for the
benefit and encouragement of the all
important vocation of agriculture.

of aif political platforms.

find in it a discussion of Socialism; the
encroachments of the Federal Judiciary;
the peculiar injustice of the national gov

remedies which should be applied in order
that the political body should be made
whole.
