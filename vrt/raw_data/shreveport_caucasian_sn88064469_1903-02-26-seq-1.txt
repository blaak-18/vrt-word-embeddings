A NEGRO LYNCHED
HE WAS PULLED TO THE LIMB
OF A TREE:
He Assaulted Tom :McDade of Bossier.
Fired at and Shot Harvey Con
nell. the Overseer.
Tuesday morning shortly after 6
o'clock a tragedy was enacted on the old
Knox Point plantation in Bossier about
twenty miles below Shreveport. A long
i aw noet statement may be summar
ized in these words: Ji.n Brown, a ne
gro. occupied a cabin ot the plantation
where he was employed. When awak
ened by Mr. Connell, the overseer, he
replied that he w ould not go .to work
as his brother was in trouble. On re
porting this fact to Mr. McDade. who
is the owner of the plantation. Mr. Con
nell. was directed to return to the ne
gro s cabin and conic with him to.the lot
where he would give him his time. Jim
Brown dragged along itt a sulky mood,
muttering to himself,, until he reached
Mr. McDade who upbraided him for his
laziness. The negro rejoined witch impu
dent words. Connell had started to the
conumissary to get Brown's time when
he was startled by. McDade calling him,
"H -arvey! Harvey!" and as he faced
about saw the negro and Mr. McDade
struggling desperately. The negro held
a six-shooter in his right hand. As Con
nell rushed tpwards the combatants he
could not fire without endangering Mc
Dade. Suddenly the negro released his
grasp on McDade and fired at Connell,
who was shot in the forearm, and a sec
ond shot struck him in the leg. Connell
was disabled and powerless to defend
himself or to assist McDade. The negro
then jumped aside and fired at McDade
and ran away. As the pegro was fleeing
he was shot in the leg lA* Connell, who
had emptied his pistol.
A posse of white men was organized
.and after a brisk ride Jim Brown was
captured, disarmed and hanged to a tree
near McDade station on the Shreveport,
and. Red River Valley road ao t half
a mile Atant from the place where the
negro had shot Connell.
The negro was regarded with disfavor.

IICASTRO IS RESTLESS.
Representatives of the Allied Powers
Assert That the Vessels Will Be
Given Back as Soon as
Formalities Are Over.
Washington. Feb 23.-Advices were
received at the state department from
Mr. Russell, the United States charge,
at Caracas, to the effect that none of
I the Venezuelan vessels captured by the
blockading fleet had been returned as
yet, and that there seas considerable
confusion in the public mind as to the
reading pf the protocols on this point
In the absence ,of the texts of the
- I agreements, which have not arrived.
President Castro does not know wheth
er he should send his crews toTrini
dad, where the ships are being held,
or whether he should insist upon their
return to Venezuelan waters.
Minister Bowen has received sev
eral cablegrams from President Castro
regardink the action of the allies in re
taining the ships, and is evidently
growing restive at what he considers
a breach of trust.
The allies representatives, here,
hoeever, take the. position that the
ships will be returned as soon as the
"necessary formalities hake been en
acted."
The British ambassador has seen
Secretary Hay regarding the matter
and assured him that the London gov
ernment was doing everything possible
to expedite the return of the ships,
and that the foreign office was having
the co-operation of the admiralty in
this, effort.
After a lengthy conference with
high officials of the Washington gov
ernment, Mr. Bowen announced that
he would call on tHe Italian and Brit
ish ambassadors and the German min
ister and inform them lhe was ready

Success.
r New York. Feb. t8.t--North Louisiana
may be. justly proud of her many suns
o and daughters who have attained promi
nence in intellectual achievements at
home and abroad. Even here in New
York, the Mecca of America, where
come those of every profession eagerly
e seeking name and fame, and where only
- the strongest and best achieve success,
we find men and- women from Louisiana
n in the front rank. Among these is one
r who has attained celebrity in literary and
e newspaper circles-Homer Fort-one
of the most popular writers in New
g York.
About twenty-three years ago Mr.
h Fort began his newspaper career in
Shreveport. Desiring a larger field, he
went to New Orleans. and finally came
to New York where his ability was soon
y recognized. For several years he was
e engaged on the leading dailies. He writes
e pure English. both in prose and verse.
His versatility and great success as an
t. interviewer caused a constant demand
0 for his articles.
Mr. Fort has arrived at that happy
3 stage in a newspaper man's life when it
s is no longer necessary for him to do
s staff work. His articles find a ready ac
ceptance, by the leading periodicals
, throughout the country. Successful as
r he has been .n the past, the future
promises still greater things. He has
lately written a play, which those who
have read the manuscript give him first
rank as a dramatist. A rich New Yorker
has shown his confidence in its success
r by offering to "back" .Mr. Fort in its
I productiort Next fall the play wig be
presented on the New York stage. Those
who are familiar with Mr. Fort's lucid
style, keen wit, vivid imagination and'
I thorough knowledge . of human nature
are sure of its success. X.
