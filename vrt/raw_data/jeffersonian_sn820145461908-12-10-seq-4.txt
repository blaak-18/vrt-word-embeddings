PAGE FOUR
The 'Mission of the People’s Party
The mission of the People’s Party,
as I understand it, is to make this
government in reality a government
of, by, and for the people; or, in other
words, take this government out of
the hands of parties, party bosses and
grafters, and place it in the hands of
the people where it rightfully be
longs. Let the people (not party)
say what laws shall govern them—
what laws shall not be imposed up
on them-; and the right to recall un
faithful public seiwants, without hav
ing to wait six years before we can
call a halt, if a servant betrays his
trust. A vote for a People’s Party
candidate, upon a People’s Party plat
form is not a vote to place the Peo
ple’s Party in power; it is a vote
to place the people in power. Under
our present representative form of
government, it matters not how im
portant a measure may seem to be to
the masses, it is no use bothering with
it, until we get direct legislation. The
more important, the less likely we
are to get it. When we get a consti
tutional amendment giving the people
Direct Legislation, then we can ask
the question without blushing, “Shall
the people rule?” Under our pres
ent representative form of govern
ment, the people for the next four
years will be about as helpless as a
half-grown mouse in the jaws of a
lion. The only logical way out of
our present bondage, is for the people
to take hold of the big stick, and wield
it in their own interest, and self-de
fense, instead of letting a party rule
in its own interest, and in the interest
of those that helped them to office.
With Direct Legislation established,
the elector will feel more keenly the
responsibility resting upon him when
he goes to cast his ballot. It will have
a tendency to make him a more intel
ligent voter. He will begin to realize
that his good can only come through
the general good and welfare to so
ciety ; and not from special friends for
special favors. With the power to re
call unfaithful public servants rest
ing with the people, a United States
Senator, for instance, that would sell
his influence, might have to hunt an
other job before his term of office
would otherwise expire, and the pur
chaser might lose his money. I am a
strong believer in the principles set
forth in our Omaha platform, but I
believe the People’s Party, in its next
campaign, should make Direct Legis
lation the only issue upon which to
make the fight, believing that the peo
ple are ready "or it, and that we will
have to get that, before we will ever
be able to get much of the other. As
we said before, it will then be for the
people (not party) to say what they
want, and what they don’t want, in
stead of having to submit, as at pres
ent, to a few servants that transform
themselves into bosses, and some
times boodlers.
Our present system of voting is
very unsatisfactory. Take, for in
stance, the platforms of the two lead
ing parties with six or a dozen meas
ures in each, compelling the elector
to indorse all, or reject all. The Re
publican party declares for a high
protective tariff, and the single gold
standard. The Democratic party de-
dares for a tariff for revenue only,
and the single gold standard. How,
for instance, is an individual that be
lieves in a high protective tariff, but
does not believe in the single gold
standard, going to cast a vote that
will properly register his ideas of just
measures? It is simply an impossi
bility. With Direct Legislation we
can overcome this trouble. It will
help wipe out this undue love for par
ty that sometimes gets away with our
better judgment, and which, accord
ing to my views, cost an individual
I once saw the presidency of these
United States. In my opinion, with
Direct Legislation, the people of this
country would soon be transacting
their own business with their own
money, instead of paying a corpora
tion two interests to get to use their
notes as money.
As long as the people of this coun
try say that we cannot have any real
money unless we go to those people
that happen to have some yellow
metal called gold, and say to them
that we will take it, build and equip
a mint, refine it, coin it, make it the
only real money by law, free of
charge; borrow it, and pay interest
for all time to come, and stand good
for all loss by abrasion and every
other way, I will have no money to
send to other countries for mission
ary work. There may be countries
where people are groping around in
worse Egyptian darkness, but I will
have to first be convinced of the fact.
A man can cultivate a taste for
strong drink, until that desire or ap
petite is stronger than his will power
to desist; then, as a rule, he is gone.
I think we can also cultivate and give
away to party spirit, until many
times it warps our better judgment.
Let us get away from party, and un
due party fealty as much as possible,
and in so doing we will be more like
ly to seek the common good of all,
with common sense and reason.
Reader, if, for instance, we could
take the financial question out of
party, and force an issue on that
question alone tomorrow, do you think
the decision would be the same as
that rendered on November 3,190 S?
That the masses would prefer to let
a banking corporation issue our cir
culating medium at a cost of two
interests, and inflate it or contract it,
as best suited their interest? Or do
you think they would vote for govern
ment issue of money direct to the
people for services rendered, and save
this interest?
As it appears impossible for the
people to get any important reform
measures through our present system
of representative government, and as
we must first get a constitutional
amendment, before we can get Di
rect Legislation, how would it do for
the People’s Party to organize (and
that in the near future), and force an
issue just on a constitutional amend
ment, giving the people the Initia
tive, Referendum and Recall? By so
doing, I believe we can get there,
or force some other party to adopt it.
What do we care if the party—the
body—dies, if by dying the spirit of
Populism can be made more manifest,
and the country checked in its swift
Cl)e
march to the graveyard of nations?
When we get that, the people can get
just what they want, and the corpora
tions, trusts, combines, and politi
cians can be deprived of much of
the undue advantage and power they
now possess, and it will give us a
government of, by, and for the peo
ple; and that will be something we
have not got.
There has been so much injustice*
wrought in the past by undue fidelity
to party, that I almost hate the word,
“party.” If we should ever conclude
to change the name of our organiza
tion, let us call it The People’s Ref
erendum, instead of The People’s
Party. Populists, what do you think
about it? If you like the idea, how
shall we proceed? If you don’t like
it, what is your plan? Shall we con
tinue to sell the birthright our fath
ers bought for us with so much treas
ure and blood for only two millions
of boodle every four years, when
John D. alone gets twenty-five mil
lions per annum out of it? I, for
one, do not want to give up the
fight. Let us hear from you.
