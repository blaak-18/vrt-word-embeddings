What ® ur Farmers Are Saying and Doing
Read This, Farmer
It won’t cost you a penny to reach
out a helping hand to a great army
of honest, hard-working and deserv
ing men and women.
Just your moral support will in
sure work, a living, and comforts
which are now either partly or wholly
denied them.
How so?
Come on, just have a look.
You’ve often been importuned and
many have been commanded by ad
vertisements and otherwise to “re
fuse to buy anything unless it bears
the union label.”
Looks harmless on its face, doesn’t
it?
It really is a demand that you boy
cott the products made by over eigh
ty per cent, of our American work
ing men and women who decline to
pay fees to, and obey the dictates of
the union leaders.
It demands that you ask the mer
chant for articles with the “union
label,” thus to impress him with its
importance.
It seeks to tell you what to buy
and what to refuse. The demands
are sometimes most insolent, with a
“holier than thou” impudence.
It demands that you take away
the living of this eighty per cent, of
American working men and women.
Is that clear?
Why should a small body of work
men ask you to help starve the larger
body?
There must be some reason for the
“union label” scheme.
Run over in your mind and re
member how they carry on their
work.
During a discussion about working
or striking in the coal regions, about
twenty-five thousand men preferred
to work; they had wives and babies
to feed. The union men said openly
in their convention that if the em
ployers didn’t discharge these men
they (the union men) would kill
them.
So they dynamited about a dozen
homes, maimed and crippled women
and children and brutally assaulted
scores of these independent workers.
The big boys of the union men
were taught to pound the school chil
dren of the independent men. How
would you like to have your little
girl, shortly grown from the toddling
baby who used to sit on your lap and
love “Daddy,” pounded by some big
bullies on her 'way home from the
school where she had gone to try
and please Daddy by learning to
read ?
The little bruised face and body
would first need tender care, while
you ponder the inscription writ deep
in your heart, by that Master and
Guide to all human compassion, “In
asmuch as ye have done it unto one
of the least of these, my brethren,
ye have done unto me.” Then per
haps you would drop to your knees
and pray Almighty God for strength
in your right arm to strike one man
ly and powerful blow for baby’s sake,
even if you went to your death for
• it.
Helpless children were brought
home, with faces black and bleeding
from the blows and kicks of these
fiends, teaching independent Ameri
cans that they must stop work when
told and pay fees to the leaders of
“labor.” Thousands of men, women
and children have been treated thus.
From somewhere, O Father of us
all, we try to believe that You look
with pitying eyes upon these brumal
blows, cuts and hears on the many
human bodies made in your likeness
and image.
They are beautifully and wonder
fully made, each the dwelling-place
of a Divine soul.
Is it Your wish that they be crush
ed by iron-shod heels, cut by knives
or torn asunder by bullets and dy
namite?
May we venture to think that a
long-suffering patience is extended, in
the hope that the men and women of
America may some day awake to a
realization of the awful cruelties per
petrated by this spirit of oppression
and that they will some time learn
the lesson that the “sacred gift of
human freedom and liberty” was
given by God and must be defended,
even to death itself.
Our forefathers were used by the
Infinite God to establish our freedom
in 1776, and our fathers gave freely
of their blood and treasure to estab
lish the freedom of the black. Now,
again, it seems that we are called
upon to protect our brothers and
ourselves from that old-time spirit of
tyranny which comes up from time
to time to force people to obey tyr
annous rules and bend the knee of the
slave.
Tn Wellston, Ohio, thirty Americans
sought employment in a factory.
They were seeking to earn food for
their families. They were bombard
ed by rocks and pounded with clubs
in the hands of union men.
One of the injured, John Branni
han, was taken to the city hospital
with a broken jaw, crushed skull and
other cuts and bruises. He was the
father of two little children, and .was
thought to be dying. Perhaps he did.
I don t know, but I sometimes won
der what the children said to mother
when “papy” didn’t come home, and
how they and the little woman got
any food, and how they could place
their wrongs before their own Ameri
can fellows.
Mayhap sometime some kind per
son will equip a home where the or- '
phans and widows of the victims of
the Labor Trust may be cared for and
fed.
It would take a big home. It has
been said there were thirty-one Amer
icans, many of them fathers, killed
in one strike (the teamsters in Chi
cago), and over five thousand maim
ed, many for life. That’s only one
“lesson” of these bullies. There are
literally thousands of cases wherein
your fellow American has been as
saulted, maimed or killed by these
men. The same work is going on day
by day. Suppose you make a practice
of picking out each day from the
papers accounts of brutality to Amer
ican workingmen who prefer to work
3effersottian
free from the impudence and tyranny
of self-constituted leaders(?) than to
be always subject to their beck and
call, pay them fees and be told by
them when and where to work, and
for whom. will discover the
same general conditions underlying
all these daily attacks.
In every case the workingman pre
fers to be free. He has that right.
He then tries to go to work. He and
his family sorely need the money for
food or he wouldn’t run the risk of
his life. Many such a man has wiped
the tears away and quieted the fears
of a loving wife, left with a kiss on
her lips, set his manly jaws and walk
ed into a shower of stones and bullets
to win food for the loved mother
and babies.
A good many have been brought
home on stretchers with blood ooz
ing from nose and ears, some cold,
while some gradually recover, and
carry for life the grim marks of the
“union label.”
They are your fellows, my friends,
and yet you supinely read the ac
counts and say “too bad.”
Have you grown so callous that
you care nothing for the sufferings
of these men who need food and
these helpless ones who rely on the
life and strength of husband and
father?
Let us hope that soon you may be
moved by a just God to rise in your
might and by voice and pen, by vote
and right arm, you will do a man’s
part in protecting yourselves and
your brothers from this onslaught on
American citizens. This cruel war
fare carried on not always to raise
wages, but to establish union control,
kick out the independent men and
establish the “label.”
Unfortunately the “labor move
ment” which started many years ago
honestly enough has fallen under
control of a lot of tyrannical, vicious
“men of violent tendencies.”
There are too many to attempt to
name. You can recall them. They
include men who have planned the
murders of miners, teamsters, press
men and carpenters, shoemakers and
independent workmen of all kinds.
Many of them have escaped hanging
by an outraged public only because
juries became terror-stricken and
dared not convict them.
Some have been punished slightly
and some, including the principal of
ficers of this nefarious crew, are now
under sentence to imprisonment, but
have appealed their cases.
Right here some apologist rises to
protest against “speaking thus of la
boring men.” Bless your dear heart,
it isn’t the honest and real workman
who does these things, it is the ex
citable ones and the toughs and thugs
who don’t work except with their
mouths, but have secured control
of too many unions. I don’t even
attempt to specify the criminal acts
these persons have assisted or wink
ed at in their plan for destroying free
workingmen and forcing men to stay
in “the union,” and hence under their
control. The newspapers for the past
seven years contain almost daily ac
counts of the criminal, lawless and
tyrannical acts against American citi
zens and haven’t told half the tale.
