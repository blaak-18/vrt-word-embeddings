WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1876.
e 7Champion American Comic Paper !
t Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
y can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
it the day.
. Wild Oats now enters successfully np
it on the sixth year of its existence, and
a. has become the established humorous and
at satirical paper of the country. It was
i. started and continued the first year as a
it monthly, then, to satistfy the demand of
a. the public, it was changed to a fortnight
it ly. Still continuing its good work of
1. hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
it the political and social shams by its
i. masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the. ablest
- and brightest of its class. Since then we
e have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
e weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
it ug the first successful weekly humorous
i. paper ever published in this country.
it Among the artists especially engaged
. to furnis!! illustrations for Wild Oats are
t Frank Bellow, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
' Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
I. others who are yet known to fame.
it In its literary departments Wild Oats
. will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
e pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
h and character writers in the United
a States; while its sketches and squibs
f will be sparkling, original and pointed.
t Wild Oats will be first-class an every
particular, and on this account may be
t taken into the best families without fear
a or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
t tidious.

w READ THIS :
"Scott Town, Lawrence County, Ohio.
Messrs. KENNEDY & CO.-Dear Sirs: At this late hour I will inform you of the
great benefit I received from the use of Dr. Radcliffs Great lemedy, Seven Seals
or Golden Wonder, after being confined to my bed for eight years with a conmplica
tion of disaseas.,viz: Dyspepsia, Bronchitis,: Palpitation of the Heart, Pain in the
Right Side, with General Debility, for which I tnred the skill of our home physi
cians, also a doctor of New York City, and two of Pittsburgh, and one in the
northern part of Ohio. Took enough patent medicines to swim in-all to no pur
pose. At length I was induced to try Dr. Rad:clifls Seven Seals or Golden Wonder.
I sent and got six fifty cent bottles, and before using it all founnd myself able to
travel in a buggy. Took the agency for its sale last April, four months ago, and
have sold thirteen gross, or 1,872 bottles, up to this dlate,, A ,gnt 20th, 1872, and
expect from the growillg dellalid to sell ten thoutsalnd (10,000) bottles inl the next
year. Gentlemen, if youl think this worth using you ca:nt do so, as I am generally
a known over three counties as a man of great aitlliction.
S Yours Respectfilly, II. J. DARLING.
Â·i ----oo
A REMEDY FOK HARD TIIES, TRY IT.
FOR THIS GREAT REMEDY WE WISH YOU TO ACT AS OUR AGENT.
.---.-oo--
Dear Sir:-The atove fully explains the articles we wish to sell. This business
'f is honorable, and by being energetic, will pay you well. It is our desire to ap
ploint at agentt in every county in all parts of the United States adm Canada, granl
nig to each thle exclusive right to sell every bottle sold in the county. Should yon
- accept the agency for one or more counties, you shall have the exclusive right to
d sell every bottle sold in your county, as long us you continue to act as oar agent,
I and all orders which we may receive from your territory shall be turned over to
a your account.
This Wonderful Remedy, Seven Seals or Golden Wonder, sells rapidly in the
I hands of the right kilnd of ment, and we want aone other. Now if you think you
, are the man for the work, forward your order, name your county, and go to work;
Syou canu sell a gross in a few days, without a doubt. WVe htave one man who buys
on an averege three gross per week, and his orders are in3reasing rapidly, and ihe
has a smadl'counlty, (Berks Co., Pa.) lie writes that he e.pects to sell one grose
Sper day, at retail, the coming season, not counting wholesale. Yon have tile pIiv
lege of selling wholesale or retail, or putting it on ommuission with druggists, or
. selling by esub-ageits. This business is worth the attention of good men and men
of capital. Should you make but reasonable wages--say $100 per monthi for the
first three months (niany make more)-you would nevertheless be establishing a
business that would pay you largely in the end.
Agents are doing better with our Remedy than anything else they ever took
hold of. Why is this ? Because the Remedy does just as we say, and our agents
I can warrant every bottle. No cure, no pay. Knowing that we make all losses
.good, should they be called on to redeem a bottle, agents run no risk of loss.
Seven Seals or Golden Wonder is put up in *1,0" and 50 cent bottles, elegantly
finished in neat and appropriate wrappers, and lpacked in nice boxes, one dozen in
each box.
To druggists our scale of priees are-Large size, $1.00 bottles, per dozen, $8.00
small size. 60 cent bottles, per dozen, $1.50.
We give special terms to our County Agents at such tigures that they can sell
to druggists and country stores at the aboveprice and make a handsome profit.
SWe also give an
Extra Premium to Agents!
In order to have live, energetic men to take hold of the business at once, we
have concluded to give free gratis to each and every agent apresenut of a handsodame,
hflue
Coin Silver IHunting Watch, Free,
Beautifully engraved, and correct time-keepr, worth $20,00, and a certificate of
agency giving SOLE CONTROL of such county as the agent may select (not al
ready taken); and, furthermore, all orders coaming from rsuch counties as the agent
may seleet, will be sent back by us to the agent to be- filled-in fact we give sole
control of such counties as long as the agent eontinues in the bnsiness. Remember,
the Prenmium Watch is giqtven gratis to the agents. We take this plan to have our
Great Remedy quickly and thoroughly introdueee. Let us hear from you at your
earliest convenienee, and ecaure your county at once, before being taken by some
one else. Remenmber, this olfer is olpen for a short time only.
