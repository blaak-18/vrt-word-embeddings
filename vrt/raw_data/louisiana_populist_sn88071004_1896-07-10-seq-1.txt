People's Party Platform.
FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES.
First-That union of the labor
forces of the United States this day
cosummated shall be permanent
and perpetual, may its spirit enter
all hearts for the salvation of the
republic apd the upulifting of maln
kind.
Second-Wealth bwlongs to him
who creates it, and every dollar
taken from industry without an
equivalent is robbery. "'If any will
not work, neither shall he eat."
The interests of rural and civic
labor are the same; their interests
are identical.
Third-We delieve that the time
has come when the railroad corio
rations will either own the people
or the people must own the rail
roads, and should the governumrnt
enter upon the work of owing or
managing any or ll og the rail
roads, we should favor an :mend.
ment to the constitution by which
all persons engagad in tha govern.
ment service shall be placed under
a civil service regulation of the
most rigid character, so as to
prevent the increase of the power
of the national admiristration by
the nuse of snh additional govern
ment empioyes.
FINANCE
First--We demand a national
currency--aate, sound and flexible
-issed by the general govern
ment only, a full legal tender for
all dobta, public and private, and
that without the use of banking
eorporatilons, a just, equitable and
efficient means of distributing di
rect to the people at a tax not to
exeaed 2 per cent per annum to be
provided as set forth in the sub.
treasury plan of the Farmers' Al
liance or a better system; also by
payments in discharge of its obli
gations for public improvements.
We demand the free and unlimi
ted eonlage of silver and gold at
the present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
Ite demand that the amount of
circulating medium Iw speedily in
rearned to not less than $50 per
calita.
We demand a ,rnaduated is come
tar.
We believe that the money of
the nemtry shonuld be kept as much
as possible in the hands of the Ieo
1de. and hence we demand that all
state and national revenues shall
be limited to the necessary expen
am et the groveerapnt economical
ly amid honestly administered.
We demand that the postal a
vinp bank be established by the
government for the safe depeait of
the ermuilae f the people and to
hetlltate exehange.

From Cloutierville.
Cloutiervllle, La. June 29th, '95.
Editor Louisiana Populist:
As I have not seen anything in
your valuable paper from this ward
since the election, I thought I
would give you a few lines and let
your readers see how the People's
party is dying out in ward 10.
In 1892, we polled 36 votes at
I Cloutierville for Tannehill for Gov
cruor. In 1896, we polled 120 for
Capt. Pharr, and carried the wardl
by 32 majority, and elected every
officer. One Police Juror, two Jus
e tices ot the Peace and two Consta.
bles. The Democrats polled 89
t votes at Cloutierville, and did not
elect a single officer. Then they
will tell you that the People's par
ty is dying out, and this is the way
it is dying in ward 10.
If our party continues the fight
and keeps in the middle of the read
until 1900, there won't be Demo
-,rats enough lest in ward 10 to
tell the story of their defeat We
have made a good fight throughout
the parish this time, although we
have been cheated out (f our
Bheriff and Clerk. We know that
we have elected them, and this is
consolation to us; we know our
strength, and so does the Demo
crats know it, and they are holding
the offices to-day that thiy know
that they have not been elected to,
but they have been counted in.
But let them have them, if they I
can live with them, we can live I
without, and next, time we will 4
give them a double dose, and befat
them so bad that they won't know
that they were ever in the race.
All we have to do is to keel, up 1
the fight sad stay in the middle of I
the road, and in 1900 we will sweep
Natchitoches parish, and elect
every offieer in it.
Yours for reform,

The special committee of the U.
S. Senate is now trying to investi
gate Clevelane's bond issues. The
investigation doesr.'t pan out very
Iresly, owing to the tact that tihe
nmillionaire rascals engaged in the
disgraceful affair refuse to answer
questions which would uncover the
bottom facts.
August Belmont, and J. Pierre
pont Morgan flatly refused to tell
how much they made in the deal,
or to whom they resold the bonds:
These men know they have been
accused of clearing $9,000,000 on
this secret, unlawfurl, and infamous
transaction. They know that the
connection of Stetson, Cleveland's
partner, with the deal, brings
Cleveland himself under suspicion;
yet, knowing all this, they refuse
to tell who got the bonds, or to
state what the profits were.
The Democratic Noah is drunk
again, it seems, and needs more
cloak.-People's Party Paper.
The silver erase o the Demo.
crats in the south is purely a Pop
ulist measure. It takes brains to
formulate a platform but any fool
can seal it.-Farmer's Champion.
It costs $500,000,000 a year to
run the national governmen( and
there are two armies of candidates
constantly striving for the "costs
in the case."-Lithotome.
Bossier and We!!ster held an
anti-dynamite meeting at Gunnm
Ford the 26th, of June.-Banner
of Liberty.
The difference between Nero and
Clevelmad is that the former
Addled while his country went
to rain, and his city burned, while
the latter goes fishing and hunt.

We hope both gentlemen will be
