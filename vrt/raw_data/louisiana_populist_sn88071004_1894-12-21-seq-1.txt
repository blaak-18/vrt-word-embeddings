THE POWER OF WORDS.
By Mits LENA HOYDSTON.
First Baptist Church S. S., ('li;l
er, La., Nov. 4, 1894.
Who knows the power of a few
words, one little sentence uttered
with loving kindness or with manl
ice! Thoughtless and malicious
words have inflicted more and
deeper wounds than any other
weapon. Where other weapons
destroy physical life, woe rds des
troy spiritual life. They are the
thieves that steal away, piece by
piece, a good reputation, until the
very character center is touched
and marred and deformed, causing
the individual to sink lower and
lower in the scale of morality and
spirituality.
Schiller said truly that, "Tale
bearers have done more mischief
in the world than the poisoned
bowl or the assassin's dagge r.'
How careful one should be in
speaking of another! Silence is
golden when one has nothing good
to say of one's neighbor.
On the other hand, words have
been and will ever be the light and
life of the world. The Bible is
God's word, and who will deny
that the Bible is the lite of the
world? The book itself teaches
that, "man doth not live by bread
alone, but by every word that pro
ceedath out of the mouth of the
Lord doth man live." Think, med
itate upon the power of (God's
word I Salvation! Eternal life
and happiness ! Who could re
fuse to speak a little word of love
for Jesus' sake? We are told that
"A word spoken in due season,
how good it is !" Again, "A word
fitly spoken is like apples of gold
in pietures of silver." Such words
heal the heart wounds that thought
less words have made. A simple
word, a kind "good morning," a
hearty "thank you!" a pleasant
"how are you?" may lighten a
heart that is heavy with sorrow;
may make some one happier and
better.
From Genesis to Revelations,
the Bible is full of warnings as to
the right use of the tongue. Man
is commanded to bear no false wit
ness against his neighbor, to speak
evil of no man, to bridle his tongue.
turely God foresaw bowdifficult
it would be for man always to
speak kindly, sad for this reason,
(in the words of Oelton) "Men are
born with two eyes, but with one
tongue in order that they may see
twice as much as they speak.
In James, 2, these words are
hbad: "If say man oad not in
wordth same is a peetfat man.
and able also to bridle the whole
body." 0 that all men would

Good Advice.
You can carry your country if
you will sow the literature thick
enough, and do it now before par
ty prejudice i-i appealed to by the
office seekers. It \will be no more
difficult to convert a majority than
to convert those now with us. It
simply requires more of the same
kind of work, that's all. Put a
good reform paper in the home of
every working man and you need
have no further campaign expens
es. Or; will you wait until about
election time, spend five times the
money and get but meagre resultsI
Go to work now, solicit subscrib
ers and if one will not subscribe,
pay for it for him out of a sum
you should have provided. Edu
cate the voters or be enslaved by
them. .There is no other alterna
tive. Go to work now, and see
that every home has at least one
reform paper, the abler the better.
Go to work.-The Coming Nation.
Keep Up The Watch Fires.
Now is the time, while there is
no political excitement, to educate
the masses of the people, and when
there is no pulling or dragging on
the part of the Punch and Judy
party to distract the attention of
the people from the real causes of
the trouble from which the coun
try is suffering. A campaign of
education should at once be inau
gurated and meetings held in every
city, village and hamlet in the
country. It is a mistake to think
that the best and only time for
such education is in the midst of
a political campaign. The Peo
ple's party do not desire nor in
tend to appeal to the passions and
prejudices of .the people by re
sorting to electioneering lies and
misrepresentations of various
kinds. The truth is all sufficient
for their purposes, and the truth
is what the great mass of the peo
ple are in search of, and'which
they fail to get from either of the
old parties.
In the next great contest fore
president both old parties will be
found fighting the People's party.
In several states such combina
tions were formed during the late
campaign to down the Populista,
and it was only by such fusion
that they, in some instances, ac
complished their purpose. This
shows that they fear the young
giant of Populism. and if they
deem it necessary, will join teams
to defest the Populists at the next
presidential election, when the
question of finance will be the issue
Forewarned is forearmed, and no
time ought to be lost in preparing
for that great battle two years
hene.
The life of the country is at
stake. The I:tion is today within
the clutches of the money power
and is .trumigling tbi shake of the
chains which bind it to Wall street
in New York, and Lombard street,
London. iThe power of the com
m1on people is all that can save the
nation. That lpower is their 1tallot,
and they shotul' be taught to use
it for their own safety and that of
their children, as well as genera
tion I yet uniliorn.-Facts & Fitiures.
Facts and Figures.
One of the themes of which the
zeal of the moss back editor never
wearies is the ibeautyi of the hog
and houminy system. According
to this thery, the Georgia farmers
are fools, who by their preverso
ness in raising cotton have brought
ruin on themselves and Sampson
like, have involved the whole coun
try in their own misfortune. If
the said ft oW farm rs would only
raise hog and hominy they would
swiftly make the desert bloom
again as a rose and force that solid
prosperity to smile upon the coun
try which has eluded the painsta
king effort of a democratic aclmin
istration.
And some otherwise very semi
ble people, but who understand
farming or the present condition
of the country about as well as a
Ilottentot does Greek, have believ
ed this idle prating, and pinning
all their faith on the efficacy of
the hog and hominy cure, are pray
erfully looking for the day when
the said fool farmers shall cease to
want the government to legislate
money into their pockets, and raise
corn and oats and hogs, which is
to usher in the dawn of the demo
cratic millenium.
Oh, if only the fool farmers
would cease their perverseness and
go pell-mell into the hog and hom
iny business!
John B. Gordon, however illus
trious he may be, is not the only
Georgia farmer. He has a rival.
To his other varied offices Hon.
W. F. Eve adds that of a farmer.
Under his direction one of the lar
gest farms in the county is mana
ged to the best possible advantage.
Intent as he always is in the dis
charge of his official duties to ben
efit the people, the judge has spar
ed no pains to make this farm a
model as well as a profit to the
country. Unfortunately the judge
has been captivated by the specious
hog-and-hominy arguments of the
subsidized editors. He has reduc
ed it to practice. In calling atten
tion to the county farm it is not to
cast a reflection upon him or his
assistants, but to show the beauty
of the hog-and hominy system in
its perfectness. His farm super
intendent is acknowledged to be
not only a practical but an expert
farmer, the plantation is among
the best in the county, the sea
sons have been excetionally pro
pitious and the result of the hog
and hominy system, as shown this
year on the county farm, may be
accepted as very best possible to
be achieved.
Here it is, with every figure ta
ken from the official reports of the
grand juries of May and Novem
ber.
The working force of the farm
is comprised of 1~ head of mules
with hands sufficient to work them.
That no idle hands are kept is
shown from the fact that only nine
are employed now, while more are
sent when they are needed. They
receive no pay, and the only ex
pense they have is the cost of feed
ing, clothing and guarding them,
which is certainly less than the
cost of puidlaborwould be. They
raised this year -about 7000 bush
els of corn, 1440 bushels of oats,
110 tons of hay and about 50 hogs.

Will the gourd-headed elitors
make a note of this ?
Not much. They will just go
on as they have been doing for the
all sufficient reason that my father
before-me-was.
But honest sensible men will see
that *"hog and hominy" will do no
better than cotton. They will stop
looking for the milleniuim to come
when the farmers shall follow moss
back sanctum directions, and vote
for men to represent them in con

How to Agitate.
It takes some time for a man or
woman to get a thing straight in
their mind. To illustrate: If a
man were to desire to learn mathe
matics, the reading of the books
would not make him a mathemeti
cian. If he could read them all in
a week he would still not accom
plish anything. The mind would
not have the time to absorb, di
gest and arrange the ideas. lie
would require months, or years,
to train the mind to think know
ingly. And until he did this, his
calculations would not be reliable.
The same is applicable to political
economy, only it is not necessary
to have such severe training to un
derstand its fundamental princi
ples. But as a man may not be
come a mathematician in a month,
neither may he become a populist
in a month. It takes time. It is
not an appeal to the emotions, as
are the flap-doodle tariff arguments
of the monopolistic press, but ah
appeal to the reason. Therefore,
all work done a few weeks before
an election will do but little if any
good, as the mind is not in that
pacific state necessary to discern
and compare statements, and has
not the time for such digestion and
understanding even if it were wil
ling, In other words, populists
are not made in a month. It takes
many months often. The mind
must be kept on the problems un
til it can analyze them-know and
feel the reasons for accepting the
new philosophy. Therefore, if
you intend to do anything toward
the propaganda of a new civiliza
tion, do it now. Men whom you
get interested now will before the
next campaign have had time to
study, and will then themselves be
come workers and helpers. Don't
wait. If the money spent for
books and papers two months be
fore the election had been spent
six or eight months before, it would
have influenced to understanding
half a million more minds. I have
always advised for work a long
time before election, but our own
people are slow to see the reasons.
I hope I have madeitplain. Work
now. Wewillwinin 1896ifyoul

Monopoly Slavery.
The New York Sun states that
the income of ,Joirn 1). Rockefellehr
is $24',14i4,,,,,4!. This requires the
constant labor of 54,7914 laborers
at $1 per day. Surely this control
of labor I y the control of money
is more profitable than to own the
laborers as chattel slaves. Thu
wealthiest slave holler of the south
never dreamed of being able to
hold 544,00() slaves under the sys
tem of unrestricted chattel slavery.
But under our present system of
dtlt and wage slavery it is not un

Rockefeller is but one of thou

Is it strange that the slaves are not
satisfied I Men are not usually to
blame for taking ad' antago of cir
cumstances or conditions, and it is
not against such men that reform
measures are directed. It is
against the laws which make such
conditions. Good men often make
the mistake of assuming that these
demands are aimed at the million
aires personally. It is not true.
It is directed against that system
of national economy which makes
these millionaires. -Mr. Rockefel
ler is here; by some means he has
amassed a large fortune. Under
the law it is his. These reform
measures do not propose either to
hang him or take away his proper
ty. But the people don't want
any more of this kind, fhr will
they permit him to use this im
mense leaver to enslave his neigh

suits. Who will gainsay that doc

TO FORM A SINGLE TAX
COLONY:
Pullman's Unemployed 500 Fam
ilies. Will Settle in Alabama.
Nontgomery, Ala., Nov. 11.-A
party consisting of 500 families of
the Pullman unemployed will ar
rive in Alabama during this week
and will establish a single tax
colony after the idea of Henry
George, near Blakely, Baldwin
country. They have secured 2,000
acres of fine land at $6 per acre,
located on the very spot where the
last battle of the civil war was
fought. The land lies for two and
a half miles along the beautiful
Tensas river with boat water up
to the shore. Mobile, the largest
city in Alabama, is just twelve
miles across the bay from Blakely,
and will be the market for what
surnlus products the colony pro
duces. For three months the col.
onists expect to exporience hard
shipe, as there will be little income
for them excepting from a fine
coal in bank on their land- After
that however, the land will yield
abundantly of fruits and vegeta
bles to provide comfortably for
them. Sawmill and brickmaking
machinery has been bought on
time. It is believed here that the
co-operating colony will prove a
auccess. A Lutheran minister
named Van Kock, formerly of
Ohio, but now of Alabama, is the
instigator of the enterprise.-
