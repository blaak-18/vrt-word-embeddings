A Love Legend of Ameleat Greece.
BY "CIOARTrLt."
CHAPTER XII.
"ADIZU TILL MIDNIGHT."
CYrILLA, the female attendant to
whose care the captive IrYLLIA had
been entrusted, for a long time
searebhed for the maiden whom she
had missed. She was selzid with
horror when she contemplated the
terrible revenge of wbhich shabe knew
her master capable, if the lovely
Athenian still resisted his unnatural
SImpertketles.
ICYLLIA's disappearance was unac
countable. CYrILL had seen Par.
.LARI and Nianus leave the masluon,
and with many slaves busied them
selves in one of the outer buildings;
preparing as usual, thought she, for
the perpetration of some horrid
sobheme. For hours after, she had
paced and repaced the spacilous
chambers with a torch In her hand,
searbhing for the absent lady. Some
times she would thrust her head
through the open casement and look
out towards" the ragiug sea. The
pitiless rain fell in torrents, while
the tumultuous waves urged on by
the roaring winds, swelled high above
the long terrace of the mansion, and
dashed its snowy spray against the
sides of the building with a ruelul
sound. Could the frail maiden In
despair have sought her peace be
nea h thbose devouring waves ? Could
PtaLHlils in a moment of viol.hnt
fresnzy nave robbed her of lif ? Ou !
hbrrible suggestion! At the bare
idea, a cold shiver ran through her
frame. Becoming exhausted with
ter fruitless search. she had at last
retired to her chamber. Sleep she
could not, for her grave and exltting
suspicions conceruiullng this strange
disappearance drove away rest and
calm from her troubled mind. Thus
weeping, she passed the unruly
night.
Morning dawned and the gloomy
aspect of the troubled elements had
changed.. The rain had ceased, the
winds lowered, and as she walked to
the southern casement she noticed
the eastern light piercing through
azure rents in eeah, stormy hgverer.
She saw a stugCging bark swiftly
dashing over the snow capped undu
latlons, and recognized PHALARnI
within the plunging vrewel! At this
sight bitterly she wept! Sue be
leaved the lovely maiden dead!
She had become attached to and
earnestly loved IcrLLU. Who would
ube watched the little craft -rith
tears streaming from her eyes until
her sight was dimmed and the ust
no longer could be seen. Overcome
with excess of sorrow she 'sobbed
aloud. Por a long time she thu
gave vent to her mental sufferings,
until she was suddenly awakened
from her grief by a voice, wea,
weird, tremulous.
"No roses for his tomb-no roses
for mine."
The woman looked up! She scream
ed for Joy ! louLL Ina ber long white
robes strode lake a ghost in the
artm t. SBhe was dreadfully
ed. Burning red were her
lIps-ashbed was her face sad her
eyes with unnatural brilliancy va
cantly wandered from obje to object.
As the maiden entered the chamber,
UILraL joyfully approached her
oharge, but stopped as motionless as
a statue in the centre of the room,
Istroek with the aldens strange de
menor, IcrfIr advaned oand threw
herself in a large esy ohar, uttering
a sigh that seemed to eome form the
very depths of her soul! Upwards
she turned her eye to the oeilog,
the muarmured:
"Beter be side by side with him
beneth th chilly wave, than live the
Bride of PALrI."
CYraLL awed and frighted, stood
ln meute uasstoleshment gasUing on the
obivot of her woder.
"No tlowers for his grave, no Low
ers for mlae," agl n wbispered the
Ilady,sd the attendant lmmediately

bhers of terrible mental suspense
through whblob she had pased a the
last few weeks; the seones of lntense

Bually thes two Interview of the pre

"Death for me-death for bhim l"
she softly exolaimed as Nsts stood
near. After a moments Interval she
repeated tbhi same sentence three,
several times.
"Of whom I abshe speaklar ?" ask
ed Idams, when se had ceased.
"I know not," replied the woman,

"I knoow not my lord," responded

on the frescoed celling above. Her

was slngularly quiet, Short and
t quick was her respiration, and her
I bosoms hearings were as entle as
the _pslpitating heart of a frightened
bird held In an nlfants band.
"The silver mines of Thasus," she
Sspoke again, "alas i that thou
shouldst ever have left them."
"Doet know of whom she is speak.
I nor." querried Nries.
The attendant gave a negative
shake to her head.
"Ohb ! those barbarians ! orel floods
they have enaslaved manhoods dia

There was a plaintive sweetness In
her voice that exalted the pity and
sympathy os NIBRES.
"No flowers for his grave, no flow.
I ere for mine! water! water!
CYRLLA suppling she asked for
drink, approached the maiden
with a cup of water and placed It to
her lips, but her jaws remained in
flexible. The woman withdrew re.
plolnog the cup on the table from
whence she had taken It.
"Oht Athens!" cried the virglan,
"Thou Last that within thee which
from stafar seems a noble sculpture,
White, pure and spotless-but when
we near the dissembling fqure of
marble, wormholes dark! and num
berless fissures with black stained
edges mar the stately monument!"
"Wmat strange fantasies rack her

"What can abe mean ?"
"It is Paruaas PALAnIs the de

lisped in aim.est inaudible wisepers,
then contluutog with tears gleaming
in her lhedorbs, "Oh F!therl Fath

After this she gave utterance to
many incongru,'us phrases, often.
times referring to her own lucarcera
lion within the gloomy palace, and
freq':ently n.enttinlcoi the names of
AInErA, Pjaox, loPox and MAaox.
Now and theu she would say in a
tuoe that seemed to some from her
very heart: "No tears over my grave
-no tears over his."
Her form remained perfectly Im
movable. Her golden tresses falling
fromn her head on her quickly breath.

with the alabaster throat. As she
thus lay unconscious, her face stlli
upwards turned to the selling, ias.
us wondered at her extraordinary
ueauty; and CYBILLA, overeome with
the plheous signa', wept afresh, as if
her heart was rived.
"He is the brightest star amongst
the constellations of meal" again
muttered IC.LIA. "Among the liv.
log he was a unble oak amidst with

so deserving of immortality! Tam
sALUs! noble TMsuALus, 0ome, some

"Tsnau~LsIl" eboed Nausr, bend

But the maiden eased. She olos
ed her eyes In slumber, and spoke no
more that night!
Nianss arose from his seat. "Fer
fifteen years" bhe exclaimed, "I have
not heard that name pronounced!
By heaven, I would give ten years
of my life to know of whom abe is

"My lord, Ioruc was called the
