The women of this country seem to
take great interest in msanuacturing
odd bits of decorative furniture for Ps
their homes, and many are the pretty go
and useful things that have been con- -
structed by them.
The only tools necessary for this t
work are a hammer, small saw, me
dium-sised chisel, an awl, plane and is
ails of assorted sizes. With these 0
implements she can do a great deal to
ward beautifying an unpretentious fa
home.
To make a shoe-holder and seat, as W
depicted in one of the illustrations, ob
tain at a grocery store an ordinary soap P
box and let this form the end upright
box. Get another packing case of the te
same width but longer, and arrange on if
top a lid with hinges so it may be td
raised. Use the cover to the upright di
one for two shelves, nail them securely tl
in place and let them be an equal dis
tance apart, so they will accommodate
shoes and slippers. nU
Fasten these boxes together securely ti
with screws. Next obtain a board and I
after rounding corners off screw it fast h
to the back of the boxes and you will
have as a result the frame-work for the P
smat.
The hinged lid of the low box will a
act as a seat, the board with the a

within the box rubbers and heavy 1
a boots may be kept. the upright one t
holding fine shoes and slippers. t
After long experience in domestic up- c
holstery, denim, in its rich assortment t
of colors, is found to be superior to all t
other materials. It combines artistic
beauty with astonishing durability,
and is heartily recommended to the
amateur cabinet-maker. }
The tops of the boxes should be oov- E
ered first and tufted. This may be ac- i
complished by spreading curled hair on
the wood and tacking the material over
it and at regular distances apart catch
a button to form a tuft. This is done
by boring two small holes through the
wood side by side, and, having thread
ed the eye of the button with a bit of 1
twine, pass the string through the
holes and tie the ends tightly together I
at the under side of the lid.
The material is to be tacked all
around to the outer edge of the tops
with ordinary carpet taclcs driven close
together.
Next upholster the back, placing
some curled hair behind the material
and give it a cushioned appearance and
in turn drape the sides of the boxes.
To do it nicely, shir several yards of
the material on a cord and then tack
the string fast all around the upper
edges of the boxes.
Around the top edge of each box and
to hide the joint where the covering
meets the draping material, fasten a
piece of wide gimp with large oval
headed upholsterer's tacks driven an
even distance apart. This will lend a
d good finish to complete acharming and
useful piece of furniture.
The very attractive hanging cabinet
5. shown here is also made of a couple of
packing cases.
Two shallow oblong boxes are need
' ed. and should be fastened securely to
gether with screws. the end of one to
n the side of the other as the drawing
shows. Around the top of the upright
box a narrow strip of cornice molding.
d that can be obtained from a carpenter,
is to be mitred and fashioned with
0 nails, while the top edge of the other
one may be left plain by way of con
t" trast.
Two shelves should be arranged in
the upright box and one in the other.
y The entire inside and outside of the
boxes are painted with several suc
cessive coats of some good color, light
shades being preferable. Or they may
be enameled, and when dry arrange a
small brass rod at the top of each box
Sfrom which a curtain may be suspended
on rings.
S' ilkoline or an inexpensive silk of an
n art color will wear nicely for drapery.
Y Along under the bottoms of the
boxes a few hooks can be fastened
fd rom which teacups may be hung, while
t on the top some odd bits of brio-a-brae,
t. If tastefully arranged, will lend great
Sly to the appearance.

is of course no guarantee of real value,
an eighth of a yard of an admired to
fabric and test it at leisure when she
reaches home. This' may seem like ao
waste to the over-economical mind, but
prevents a bad bargain in the end. 81
In testing a piece of silk first try to k
tear it both lengthwise and crosswise. c
If it gives way readily in either direc
tion you may be sure either that the
dye has destroyed the fibers or that the
thread is made up of what is known as
"waste silk." Pure silk properly dyed t
is the strongest textile known, but
nearly all the cheaper dyes, and pae- 1
ticularly the dark colors and black, are lc
made with such a basis that they eat B
into and weaken the fabric.
The firmness of the weave may be C
proved sy scraping diagonally across
the silk with the thumb nail. If the
material ti strong and pure, any
amount of manipulation will not make a
the threads slip, and if the nail makes
a space as wide as Its own thickness be
tween the threads the silk is certainly
of inferior quality. The. next test is ap
plied by raveling a bit of the silk and
carefully -examining both warp and
woof. Often a pure silk warp has a
heavily loaded woof, and in other
cases, especially in satin weaves, the
woof has an inferior backing, the su- a
face being of good silk. Pure silk has e
a good luster and is very soft, but if
the gloss is artificial the fabric will be °
hard and brittle. When a pure silk has
been dyed improperly it looks very
much like cotton, but it is somewhat
softer.
Another excellent test consists in
pulling out the threads both ways and
trying their strength. Catch them with a
both hands an inch apart, give a quick
jerk and note the force needed to break
them. If they part easily the silk is
not good. Tear the silk along the
lines from which the the treads have been
taken, and if there are puckers along
the tear they may be regarded as i.vdi
cating a strong texture. A method of
testing that is considered conclusive is
1 to burn a fragment of the silk and also
some of the ravelings. If the silk is
pure and well dyed it will take fire a
slowly, even when held directly in the
flame, and the fire will go out almost
as soon as the silk is withdrawn, leav
ing ashes that are nearly jet black.
Weighted and improperly dyed silk is

... That re!lly happened to a certain
grocer's cLerk, because he couldn't induce
custoners to take an inferior brand
of washing powder in place of
Pearline. The grocer said, "If
you can't sell what I want you to
sell, I don't want you."
Now it doesn't take a
very wise woman to decide
whether this was an honest
grocer. And a woman wise
enough for that, would be
likely to insist upon having nothing but Pearline. There is
nothing "as good as" or " the same as " Pearline, the origi
nal-in fact, the only-washing-compound. If they send you
something else, send it back. ao JAMES PYLE, New York.
