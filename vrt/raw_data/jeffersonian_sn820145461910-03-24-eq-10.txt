OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
ANOTHER PRIZE CONTEST.
For the best letter on “The Sunny
South Brotherhood”, not to exceed
200 words, w’ritten by a boy or girl
under fifteen years old, to be received
in this office by April 7th, Daddy
Jim will give a handsome ring or
pin for a girl, and a baseball outfit
or a book for a boy; 2d prize, a
knife; 3d prize, a book. Letters
must be plainly written, on one side
of the paper only, and the writer’s
name, address and age must be writ
ten at the end of each letter. Say
what good you think such a brother
hood could do, especially among the
crippled, sick and needy boys and
girls; and make some practical sug
gestions as to the best way of doing
the work, what sort of badge the
members should wear, what the
rules should be, and what each mem
ber should pledge himself or herself
to do. We want to carry out Arling
Tootle’s suggestion in last week’s
Jeffersonian, and form a junior
branch of the Sunny South Brother
hood.
AN ENGLISH RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim: —For the first
time I will make an effort to join
your happy band. My papa takes
both Jeffersonians, and I enjoy read
ing the Post-Card Club. Papa is a
great admirer of Mr. Watson. I have
blue eyes, fair complexion, and light
hair. Igo to school every day I can.
My teacher’s name is Prof. Cars
welle, and I like him very much. I
will close with a riddle: “As I was
going across London Bridge, I met a
man; if I tell his name, I will be to
blame; I have told his name five
times.” For fear of the waste basket
I will close, with best wishes to
Daddy Jim and The Jeffersonian.—
Your little friend, Velver Williams,
R. F. D. 1, Avera, Ga.
A CARD FOR AN ANSWER.
Hello, Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little Georgia girl to join your Post-
Card Club. I am five feet and one
inch tall; have dark hair, blue eyes
and dark complexion. My brother
takes The Jeffersonian, and we like
to read it very much. I have two
brothers and two sisters. The an
swer to one of Mattie Patrick’s rid
dles is the sun. Now I will ask some
riddles: Thirty white horses upon a
red hill; now’ they dance, then they
stand still. (2) Eleven pears hung
upon a tree; eleven men came by;
each man took a pear; how many
were left? To the one who gives the
correct answer to these riddles I will
send a pretty post-card.—Mary
Moss, R. F. D. 1, Flovilla, Ga.
CHALLENGE TO DEBATE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l hereby chal
lenge any boy of any State in the
Union to debate, through the col
umns of The Jeffersonian Post-Card
Club, on. the following question: Re
solved, That Georgia should have
compulsory education. On that reso
lution T favor the negative. Suppose
our debate continues three weeks in
succession, with Daddy Jim as judge;
what do you think of it?—Louis
Burton, Crawfordville, Ga.
(This idea is good, but we must
have some rules. The age limit in
the club is fifteen, and we must limit
these debates to boys and girls not
over fifteen. The first acceptance of
a challenge to be received at this
office w’ill have the right of way. The
week after the acceptance is pub
lished, we w’ill print the letters of
the challenger and the opponent, the
letters not to run over 500 w'ords
each. Then each will have a week
in which to prepare his or her re
ply, which will be limited to 500
words each, and will be published at
the same time. The debate will be
closed one week later, and the clos
ing letters will be limited to 250
words each. Letters must be plainly
written, on one side of the paper
only, and name, address and age
Cshe Jeffersonian
must be given at the end of each let
ter. Daddy Jim reserves the right
to close the debate at any time, if
the letters are not written in a spirit
of fairness, free from personalities,
and adhering closely to the subject
under discussion. Now the question
is.- “Resolved, That Georgia should
have compulsory education.” Louis
Burton takes the negative. If you
think you can successfully take the
affirmative side, write to the Post-
Card Club: “I w’ill take the affirma
tive side against Louis Burton,” and
the one whose reply is first received
will be the champion of his side.)
FROM ARKANSAS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have been read
ing the children’s page, and like it
very much. I live on a farm, and go
to school, and am in the fifth grade.
My papa takes The Jeffersonian and
Magazine. I will answer Willie and
Eva Sullivan’s riddle. It is a man
with two legs, sitting on a stool with
three legs, with a leg of meat in his
lap, and a dog with four legs ran in
and took the leg of meat out of the
man’s lap, and the man threw the
three-legged stool at the dog, and
made him bring the leg of meat
back.—Your new friend, Edna
Rogers, R. F. D. 2, Charleston, Ark.
A LOUISIANA GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim and Cousins:
How are you all enjoying this fine
spring weather? Our school will be
out this week. I am in the fifth
grade. How many of the girls have
been planting flow’er seeds? I plant
ed some last week, but they have not
come up. I w’ill ask two Bible ques
tions: (1) To whom did Paul write
the story of his life? (2) Why did
Elimelech, his wife and two sons, go
into the land of Moab? I will ask
two riddles: (1) As I w’as crossing
a stream I saw' a boat full of people,
yet there w’asn’t a single one in it.
(2) As I was going to London I met
nine wives; how’ many were going to
London?—Lettie Rockett, R. F. D. 1,
Lillie, La.
(She also answers correctly the
riddles of Willie and Eva Sullivan
and Delia Coggin, but as they have
been answered before W’e do not re
peat them.)
FROM MISSOURI.

little freckled-faced girl for the first
time. lam eleven years of age. My
father takes Mr. Watson’s papers,
and likes them fine. I like to read
the letters. I live in the
country. I have one sister,and tw’o

little South Carolina girl to join your
happy band. Papa takes The Jeffer

Smith. I like him very much, and
think he is the best teacher I ever
saw. I have two brothers and one
sister. The baby is a little boy two
years old, and you just ought to hear
him sing. My little sister has writ
ten to you twice, and didn’t see her
letter in print either time. We stood
examination in spelling today. I
think I w’ill make a. hundred; I hope
so, any way. With much love to
Daddy Jim and all the cousins.—
Your little friend, Sibyl Sally, Salley,
S. C.
(Daddy Jim has been receiving
more than fifty letters a week for the
Post-Card Club, and, of course, there
is not room for all of them. We al
ways try to pick out the best letters
—those that will interest others. If
you don’t see your letter in print,
don’t be discouraged; try again.)
FROM FLORIDA.
Dear Daddy Jim:-—Mamma takes
your paper and the Magazine. I live
on the edge of Cocoa, on the banks
of the Indian river. Mamma likes
what Mr. Watson says about For
eign Missions. I have never written
before, but I always liked the Post-
Card Club. I like the children’s let
ters. I will ask one riddle and some
Bible questions; A house full, a hole
full; you can never gather a bowl
full. (1) On what mountain did
the ark rest after the flood? (2)
Who found Moses when a baby?
(3) Why did Moses slay the Egyp
tian? (4) Where did Samuel anoint
David king? (5) What did David
do when Saul was sad and gloomy?
I am in the sixth grade at school.
My teacher’s name is Miss Myrtle
Allen. With love for the Post-Card
Club, I remain, Virginia Myers.

py band. I did not see my first let
ter in print. I live on a farm, four
and a half miles from Nevada. I

lessons the first of April. My papa
takes The Jeffersonian and the

much. I am ten years old; have
light hair, blue eyes; four feet three

friend, Hazel Welty, R. F. D. 5, Ne
