rency, safe, sound and flexible, is
sued by the general government
only, a full legal tender for all debt
public and private, and that with
out the use of banking corpora
tions; a just, equitable and efliciec.t
means of distribution, direct to the
peolple, at a tax not exceeding 2 per
cent, be provided, as set forth in
the sub-treasury plan of the Farm
ers' Alliance, or some better system
also by payments in discharge of
its obligations for public improve
ments.
a. We demand free and unlimit
ed coinage of silver and gold at the
present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
b. We demand that tie amount
of circulating medium be speedily
increased to not less than $50 per
capita. '
c. We demand a graduated in
come tax.
d. We believe that the money
Sot the country should be kept as
much as possible in the hands of
the people, and hence we demand
that all State and national revenue
shall be limited to the necessary
expenses of the government, eco
nomically and honestly administer
ed.
e. We demand that postal say
ings banks be established by the
government for the safe deposit ot
the earnings of the people and to
facilitate exchange.
2. Transportation being a means
of exchange and public necessity,
the government should own and
operate the railroads in the inter
eat of the people.
a. The telegraph and telephor.e,
like the post office system, being a
necessity for the transportation of
news, should be owned and opera
te4 by the government m the in
terest of the people.
3. The land, including all the
national resources of wealth, is the
heritage of all the people, and
should not be monopolired for spec- 1
ulative purposes, and alien owner
ship of land should be prohibited.
All land now held by railroads and
other corporations in excess of
their actual needs, and all lands
now owned by aliens, should be re
claimed by the government and
held for actual settlers only.

the mighty deep, to rob them of
the fruits of their labor, made more
precious to them and their families
by the dangers they faced in pro
curing them. But while these phlns
for iplunder were being laid by
King George, the colonists were
busy in clearing lands, building
homes, schools and rurches, and
their anticipated happiness in a
free country, all their own, only be
guiled them into a lethergy that
prevented all apprehensions of evil
from the King, of then the most
powerfuill country in the world.
Yet, during the apathy that was
the result of this happiness and
hopefilness, there was looming up
from behind the political horizon
of this infant country, the darkest
of those clouds that always portend
a terrible epoch for that nation
over which they hover. When
those sturdy yeomen awoke to a
full realization of their condition,
they found that their supposedl
friend was their enemy, and had
well laid his pllans to despoil them
of their labors by the ruthless hand
of oppression, (unjust taxatiuo).
They then began to plead in a tone
of humble supplication to be ex
empted from this oppressive biiur
den, but alas I all in vain. Young
America was getting a taste of lib
erty, it must be subdued. Those
old patriots then fo' the first time
saw that there was something for
them to do, the dark and murky
cioud that hovered over and threat
enued their liberty, was momentari
ly growing in darkness and delusicf, I
and the terrific thunder it portend- 1
ed was to settle the freedom or
English domination of America. 1
All questions of tyranny being set- i
tied alone by the sword or ballot,
and our Americau heroes having i
no ballot, there was but the one
course to pursue, anut they were
not long in deciding to fight, (hon
or be to their names). As a result
the declaration of Americaun inde
pendence was made on the 4th day
July, 1776, and was the first and
grandest paper of that nature ever
originated. This brings us to a
period in our history that opens a
bloody war of seven years, in which
the weak contended for right
against the stro::g, contending for
spoils and might. God, as always,
was with the right, and it won. 1
We will, for the purpose of this
discussion leave the intervening
time to the investigations of our }
readers, and take a leap down the 1
pathway of time to a period that I
finds this country in the throes of t
another civil war, the generalities 4
of which it is not our purpose to
discuss here, nor now. But we will I
notice such features as may be con
nected with our subject, i. e. the
necessity for, and the rise and
progress of the People's Party. I
When a country has to pay, main
tain and equip a great army, a vast
amount of money is of necessity 1
required, and during the last war,
as in all othersc, gold and silver bid
out or was hoarded by money I
kings with the view of forcing
heavy interest from the govern
ment for its use. This, of course,
was attempted with Abraham Lin
coln, who cut the matter short
by instructing Congress to issue I
legual tender United 8tates treasury
notes, (or greenbacks) which Con- i
gress did to the amount of about I
one billion, eight hundred million I
dollars. This money carried the
United 8tates safely through theI
war, and was left in circulation af- I
tar the war, when there was about (
thirty amillion inhabitants. It was
pehrmnag the fuctio of money- -
that of exhbanging the title of pro- a
dms from one man to another by
npesemmtative value, and there be- It
lag a great volume of money, pro
dice brought good prices, and eve- I
ry me who was old enough in 1865, 1
and a few years following, knows I
thtEthe country was in the grest
cat properity. The men had re
t tured honne frot fouir years service
in a cruel war, aml not withstandl
sing the mtct that many of theta
- lundi their homes gonii to destruc
; tion :and their fiortuies wrecked,
they found a large volume of tloat
injg currency, and labor in demand
at good wages. and it was but a
I few years till the horrors of the
I war were supplanted by the re
- joicings over inlmmedliate prosperity,
with nothing to mar their happi
I ness, except the ever sacred memo
t ry ot some dear one lost in the
(lcause of his country. There were
lut three miillionairs and no tramps,
I but everybody prosperous and hap
Spy, what a beautihful picture. Al
most two beautiful to behold, when
we contemplate that it eminated
Sfrom the war. But why linger to
I conteimplate these prosperous times
when their very existence produc
ed that apathy that always endani
gers the liberty of the people, and
while the people were basking in
the sun shine of prosperity and
happliness, the vile schiemr and
consplirator was at work to under
mine that American liberty which
had been so dearly purchased.
chattel slavery had been abolished
and wage slavery must be estab
lished, and this could only be'done
by controlling the volume of mon
ey, thereby fixing the price of and
controlling wages and all other
!'prohlce. 'iThe great volu:me of
moley that existed as ai co5se
jtieclte ofl the war. and wvhichl was
the source of snuch iuollll)oundlel d pros
Iperity could no t be controlled,
therelfore it lut.ist be destroyed, a(n
all but $;:1,(i,I0X,tM) was called in,
IondK bearing 7 per cent interest
in gold isstued therefotr and the
:,o,,ey burnt, (It would make t is
article too l;g to specially detaill
the manner in which this money
was called in and destroyed, but
we will say that it forms the black
est page in American history, and
would advise our readers to study
it) this money was destroyed by
virtue of an act of Congress in
which 33 Republicans voted for it,
and 33 voted against it; 2S I)emo
crats voted for, and one voted
against it. Thus it is to be seen
that the Democrats could have
saved us if they would.
There are other things that could
be mentioned, and which contribu
ted to the distress that has follow
ed, but we can not mention them
here, but suffice it to say, that as
Lincoln predicted gigantic corpora
tions were enthroned; the people's
money destroyed; the issue and
control of money was turned over
to the national banks, by which
they could absorb all the wealth of
the laborer, by high rates of inter
est compounded, and also by con
trolling the volume of money con
trol the price of produce and la
bor. The apathy of the people
continued until wages were reduced
below the cost of living. The price
of produce was reduced below the
cost of production. England had
piled up a private and public in
debtedness that all the wheat, oats,
corn and cotton raised in the Unit
ed States will not pay the annual
interest on it. The people worked
harder, economised more, and grew
poorer and poorer. When sheer
necessity forced them to do so,
they began to look about them for
the cause. Lo! and behold, they
found in existence a worse state of
affairs than confronted our fore
fathers, they found that England
in collusion with the money power
of the United States was demand
ing. greater money tribute than
ever England dared to allow; and
as our forefathers, they set about
seeking relief They sent peti
tions aggregating over 300,000
names to both Democrat and Be
publican Congresses setting forth
their demands, and asking that
they or onme.uing better be enacted
into a law for their (the people's)
relief. They were ridiculed and
denounced a os fols and cranks by
- the men they had elected to repre
sent their interest. All of their
views, no matter what, were called
"visionary," "impnractical" ad 'uln
- constitutional." They plead with
I their representatives in person, and
t met with the same result. The
people of the South voting the
l)emocratic ticket; the people of
the North and West voting the
I epu blican ticket, and all expect
ing the same result, but never de
riving any benefit. In 1890), the
first intimation of any indelpend
ceat political action was manifested.
when all the labor organizations.
including the Farmers Alliance
lmet in coiiventioni at Ocala, Flori
da, formulated their iprilciples into
demands and pledged themnselves
to support the political party that
wouhl enact tlheli into a law. These
demandls were presented to the
D)emocratic national convention at
Chicago, in 1892, and the IRepubli
can national convention at Cincin
natti, in the same year. .\gain the
peolle met with a direct repnlse by
both conventionls. They were then
left right where the heroes of the
revolution found themselves with
one glorious difference that we hold
as a blessed heritage from our fore
fathers, (God bless their memories)
that is the ballot, but the people in
1890) met another obstacle, and that
was to get a rian in the field to
vote for, that was not bounll body
a;ind soul to one of f lhe ohl partles.
How was this to be done , By in
dIpellclideint )political action through
the orgaiization of a distilict and
sclperate political party lland no
iother.ll The next step was to form
that party, andt on the 4th day of
July, 1892, the representatives of
the pIeople met at Omahal, _Neb.,
formulated and signed the second
declaration of indelpeidence of the
United States, andi then and there
the great and glorious People's
party was borned ; it is no myth,
but a substantial reality come to
stay and to win, not the spoils of
office, but the liberty of the peo
pie. It made the greatest record
in 1892 that was ever made Nl any
ipolitical party in the world, of its
age. It carried twenty-two electo
ral votes, and over one million plu
rality; elected four United States
Senators and eleven Congressmen,
besides carrying several States.
This is a fair account of the neces
sity for, and the origin of the Peo
ple's party, and let us say that re
lief will come, and there are only
two sources, one by the ballot and
one by the bullet; the People's
party want it by the ballot, will
you join the party and help us, for
relief can come through no other
party, the people have tried that
sufficiently. Our platform is pub
lished in this paper, read it. We
are not ashamed of it. ,
To the Voters of the Fourth
Conlgrestr mal District.
Friends: Another election day is
about to dawn on us, and we are
to exercise that blood-bought right
of American citizens-the use ot
the ballot, in choosing a represent
ative in the national legislature
who shall be called upon to act for
the people of this district, and
represent their views on all pend
ing questions ot national goverm
ment.
Believing that the time is at hand
when it behooves men ujho have an
interest in the welfa~g of their
country to get together into one
party and to work for the welfare
of those dlependent on them, we
beseech you to consider well the
matters we present to you in this
address. For many years the only
issue between the people of the
South has been, which race shall
control the affairs of state, the col
ored or the caucsia I That ques
tion has long since been settled,
but while the attention of the peo
ple of the south has been dre;cted
to the danger of negro doininanee.
anl that of the eoll e oft the iorth
to the possibility of the dollill;nilnee
of the ('ontfiderate Ihrigadier, there
has grown up a nuneyed power
through combiilt ion:; of capital
and aggrigation of speeulative in.
terest, that thlreatenlls to entlhrone a
power more dletrimiental to the
southern people than ('arlpet.luag
governmlent, and Vllore iI njuriotls to
rtorthern and western produleer
than the much feared ('onfederate
IBrigadier poiwer. While th e eyes
of the peopl have hav teen watching
their inaginutiry enelnies, the trait
ors inl both sections have ltlindii
themselves together to deliver over
to the motney power every restage
of the wealth that can be stripped
from the people through corporate
taxation,, usury, speIulation, taritf
aId enrrency contraction. Through
excessive railroad tariffs the cream
of the tfinrer's products is taken
for transporting the balance.
Through the tnational bank monop.
oly, usury has put its elutehes on
the homes and fatrms of the people.
Through speculation the products
of the farms are sold, and their
prices fixed before the farmer has
the seed in the ground. Through
currency contraction, the cost of
monlley is carried so high that the
products of labor do not bring half
the price they shoultl, and thereby
the debtors of our nation are rob
bed by bad methods for the ltbeefit,
of creditors.
All these evils are matters sub
ject for legislation, and it is the
duty of tihe voter who has any in
terest in the welfare of the people
to do all in his power to rectify
these matters, by casting his vote
for a malltt or party pledged to labor
for the abolition of the evils that
we have pointed out. The People's
party stands pledged to work to
reform the abuses that we have
named, and we point with pride to
the good work done by the mem
bers of the People's party, who
have made a record in the House
and in the U. S. Senate. They
have stood untlinchingly by the
principles they were chosen to rep
resent. How is it with the Demo
cratic party or the Republicans.
The abuses of power we most coinm
plain of were inaugurated during
the time the Republicans had com
plete control of the government,
but since the Democrats have had
an intluence they have made no ef
fort to repeal the bad laws. Our
people trusted them upon their
pledges of reform, in case they
were given a chance. They have
failed to carry out a single impor
taut pledge. They promised us
full and unlimited free coinage of
silver, but gave us demonetization
instead. They promised us more
money through State banks of is
sue, but refused to remove the 10
per cent tax on State banks of is
sue. They promised to give us
tariff reform-and some of their or
ators almost promised absolute free
trade, but they gave us "Bill Mc
Kinly junior" instead, in fact they
have given us to understand that
the people are not the ones they are
working for anyway, but for the
corporations, such as the sugar
trust, and the railroad corporations,
as well as the manufacturers of the
east. We ask you in all candor
can you funrther go with a party
that only asks your vote for the
purpose of getting your conlsent
to draw the salaries and work for
the money power. Can you longer
submit to having your vote endorse
the broken pledges of a party you
have served during all your man
hood. The People's party on all
the questions that the Democratic
party in the past held in honor, is
as solid as the rock of ages. It
believe that intelligence, bonor
and manhood, should rule, and that
the government is safe in snob
hands. It opposes national banks
as did our Democratic forefathers.
pojsed to federal intterfcrecice ill elec
tions, as well as strikes, where the
State is comti petilut. It opposes
molopoly in all its forms, and be
lieves that this 'overnv entCt is con
trolled by it. It favor-s more won
ey less taxes. f, -ee silver and gov
eriznient banks of deposit. It op
1poses all banks of issue, except the
government own and operate them
iin the interest of the people, the
whole people, and the party asks
you if you favor theso reforms to
come and vote with us, and cease
to throw your vote away by voting
with a party that does not regard
its own platform or the pledges of
its representatives on the rostrum.
The l)emocratic party of the south
can not be any nuore solid than it
has been, but its solidity has not
benefitted the people. It is called
on to furnish the votes that elect,
but it is only the tail of the east
ern Democrat iedog-that must wag
whenever the dog wills it. It is
true that the President took some
of his inmportant olppointinents fromn
the south, b-.t whom did that bene
fit besides those who got the offi
ces I It made cotton no higher;
it lput no more money in circula
tion; it made manufactured goods
no lower.
In fact the people of the South
know expect nothing from the de
mocratic party of the East, but
that the republicans of tile East are
identified with usury, manufactur
ing and the profits of commerce,
and only a union of the West and
South can bring as good times.
We cannot expect the republicans
of the West to turn democrat, nor
can we expect the democrat of the
South to take the name of its old
enimy. So the people's or populist
is formed into which all can freely
go and make no surrender of prin
ciple or pride. We hope you will
view your own condition and com
pare it with ten years ago and ask
yourself "can I lougergointheway
I have been going! Can I longer
vote against my own interest simp
ly to honor a name that has ceased
to have a meaning iu it. Can I
longer afford to vote men into office
who must work against my interest
because the Eastern wing of the
democratic party bids them do so.
We have named a man, ion. B.
W. Baily, as our standard bearer,
whom we trust with our cause, and
we ask you to help us to send him
to join and work with a band of
invinciole patriots who have ever
been found at their post of duty'
manfully battling for right and jus
tice. We shall work and vote for
hint, believing that the crystaliza
tion of the demands upon which he
so firmly stands, into law, will
again bring happiness and pros
perity to this people.

Abrahaem Lucoina's Awful
Prophesy.
"I see in the near future a crisis
arising which unnerves me and
causes me to tlremble for the safety
of my country. As a result of the
war corporations have been en
throned, and au era of corruption
in high placea will follow, and the
money power of the country will
endeavor to prolong its reign by
working on the prejudices of the
people until all wealth is aggre
gated in a few hands and the re
publie destroyed. I feel at this
time more anxiety for the safety of
my country than ever before, even
in the midst of war.
"God grant that my fears may
prove groundless.'"
