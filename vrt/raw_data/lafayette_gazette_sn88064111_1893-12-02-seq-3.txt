to a young negro named Joseph Jack- s
son was shot last Saturday night at ti

if without saying. ul

55 years, died on the 24th near Car- da

their last resting place by a large Fse
concourse of friends and relatives.
This kind hearted lady was" looked CI
upon by her neighbors as an angel an
of mercy, for whenever any one H
was sick and needed the ministering wi
hands of kindness, this good lady
was sure to be called to the bedside, sic
and never failed to respond to the
calls thus made. She is indeed re- glc
gretted by a large number of people at
who will ever recall her many deeds Sa
of charity. And it is a slight solace dri
to know that she is enjoying her re
ward by the throne of the Supreme m
King.

the baggage car, a messenger called
Mr. M. S. Alexander, the postal of
clerk, (who is studying medicine) by
who responded, and lost no time tfu
in informing the darky if he died bl
he would be decently interred. Mr. tio
(or rather Dr.) Alexanderehen pro- sal
ceeded to apply "some necessary
restoratives" and soon had the sick buh
man out of the "jaws of death," at Wi
least so thought the darky. The
negro before departing extended "qu
thanks to W. D. Skinner, the car da'
cleaner, for his kindness, but no
thanks or money was tendered to me
the doctor. See ! Moral: "Cash
in advance hereafter." we
A visit to Biossat, the jeweler, car

any style spectacle or eye-glass you
