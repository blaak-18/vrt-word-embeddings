The Populists throughout the
State should get themselves in good
trim for the Presidential fight.
While the State was stolen from
us the delegation in the House of
Representatives is four time as
large as it was in '92 and '94. Re
member that we elected the Alli
ance Democrats and the old party
lash drove many of them from the
principles they were elected a,
but those now there were not eldt

give a good account of their stew
