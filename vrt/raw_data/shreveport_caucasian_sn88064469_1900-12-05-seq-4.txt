A WARNING TO KICKERS.
St Peter sits at the heavenly gates,
hi. hands on the strings of the lyre,
and he singe a low song as he patient
ly waits for the souls of those who
e*pire. He hears in the distance a
s-ng that swells from the foot of the
ieavenly throne, and he smiles as thi
nusic is waited along and he warbles
ilay of his own: "There is room in
this region for millions of scods, who
oy sorrow and woe have scuered, the
melody rolls, but the kicker muse
turn to the left. There is room for
.he people who, when they were
young, persisted in sewing wild oals,
yet boomed up their townpith sinew
cud tongue, but the kicker must go
-with the goats. There's room for
he people who pointed with pride to
.he beauty and growtL of their town,
rho kept singing their praise. aloud
ill they died, but the kickers will
ease amble down. They'd say that
he music was all out of tune, and the
wugelio gown 'hand me down,' and
hey'd send for a jeweler to the moon
o sample the gold in their crown
io whdle therels room for a million

were berelt, we want no complaint
