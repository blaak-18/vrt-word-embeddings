A FIERCE FIRE.
Two Briok Stores on Texsa Stra.r-t
- Destroved.
Kahn Dry Goods Co. and Wm.
Enders & Son.
Shortly alter 6 o'clock Tuesday morning
the two story brick ocenpled by the Kabu
Dry lGoods Co, limited, on Texas street,
near the Pbenix hotel, was discovered to:
be on fire.
The tire was on the second floor and the
smoke, in black, dense volumes, was
rushing through the windows facing Texas
street and In the rear and from whoch long
fli.uses leaped unrlosly. To those who
were irst on the oene it seemed as it the
whole structure, from the second floor to
the root, was afire; and when the alarm
was sounded the Are had made such pre
;ress as to ,ely the eforts of the Ire de
partment, which had leaponded promptly.
It may be remarked laoinltally that it
is singular that the firs was notdlsovered
by any one until the rhroke and Sames
were seen rushing through the window,
and the toot of the bualcing; singular, bt
ocuse the location is conspncuous and ls
on the main thoroughlare of the city. Sev.
eral persons employed near by stated that
tany had smelt the odor o fire and smeoke
some time before the alarm had been gven
and that when they looked from teolr plDsces
of business or occupation they saw flames
and nmoLe rushing IrLm the wiuowd aldU
the roof of the Kahn dry goods store.
-The origin of the tlre.is not known.
i'The fremen worked determinedly
and airected their t torte frest
to the Poenix hotel and lien
was centereda tA steady stream. of water
on the Lurning building, but the fire

M-adamus Applied for by Whites to
Hold Oklabema Claims.
Washington, Aug. 7.- Eleven per
snms, men and women, all whites or the
deseendants of whites married Indians
and who joined their fortunes years ago
with the Indians occupying lands in
Oklahoma, recently disposed of by the
secretary of the interior, have made ap
plisation to Justice Clabaugh for a man
damus against the secretary compelling
him to allow eartain selections made by
them and to withdraw the lands from
settlement.
The petitions include Emmett ox, a
son.in-law of the famous Quanah Par
ker, the big chief of the Comanche.;
William G. Williams. the president of
a bank and largely interested in cattle
raising and others engaged in cattle
raising merchandising and farming. All
have been living on their places for
years and have oultivated and improved
them. They claim they are members
of the Indian tribes by marriage and
adoption and have been respected as
such.
They assert in their petition that they
were deanied the privilege of making al
lotments to which they were entitled
under the law. They base this on an
old aset of congress.
Justice Olsbaugh issued an order re
turnable Aug. 16 requiring the secre
ary to show cause why a writ of man
damus should not issue directing him
so allow lands for the benefit of the
ptitmers.

Austin. Aug. 7.-The Texas legisla

There has not been any caucusing to
amount to anything yet, and each man
ha his own idea of how things should
be done. There are several redistrict
lug bills ready to be introduced, but
none of the authors can claim anything
save intrinsic merit for his petition at
this time.
Opinions vary as to how long the leg
Islature may be here. Quite a good
many of the members think the busi
ness should be transacted in 80 days,but
there is almost a unanimous "fear" ex
pressed that the body will be here 60
days. If all the criticism of items in
the appropriation bills now promised
develops, considerable time will be spent
on the bill. The attacks made at the
regular session on the regular session on
the railroad commission, university,vol
unteer guard and purchasing depart
ment appropriations are slated for a re
newal at this sitting, and some other
items are also spoken of threateningly.
The subjects of new legislation which
the governor is asked to submit are nu

THE STR1IKE DEAYED
President Shaffer as lie Has Rea
sonl for Such At ion.
IN SECRET SESSION,
Amalgamated Officers Drafting the No.
tice for a Etenera! Strike--Om
ilals of Steel ('ombine Not
agP d Worrying Over Delay.
Pittsburg, Aug. 7.-A general strike
order was not issued by President Shaf
fer yesterday morning and may be de
layed beyond the time limit made by
him. He says he has sufficient reasons
for the delay, but the only apparent
cause is said to be the hope that the of
ficers of the big steel corporation may
soon make overtures for peace. The
Amalgamated association, it is explain
ed, does not want to take hasty action
and proposes to rest quietly for a while.
From meager reports 'rom officials of
the steel combines, they are not worry
ing over delay, and seem to be oonfident
as ever they will win. They are en
couraged over the delay in issuing a
strike order and believe it due to the
fact the officers of the workers' organ
ization are not certain of their ability to
bring out the union men desired. One
thing appears certain and that is Presi
dent Shaffer will not call out the men
before the latter part of the week.
President Shaffer was at his office at
9 yesterday morning and at once went
to work. It is said he is preparing no
tices to the different companies in which
he will state he intends to call the men
out. No attempt has been made to
start any of the mills of this city now
tied up by the Amalgamated associa
tion, but a rumor is current in the west
end that an effort will tp made to start
the Painter mill with non-union men
this week.
President Shaffer called a meeting of
the national officers for a secert session
at 2 yesterday afternoon to submit
the proclamation and notice to the man
I afacturers of an intended general strike.
LOOKING FOR WORKMEN.
Representatives of Union Iron Works of
San Fraoelaco in New York.
New York, Aug. 7.-Representatives
of the Union Iron Works of San Fran
cisco are in the city to engage machin.
lats, boilermakers and moulders for the
company. These representatives, how
ever, apparently wish the nature of their
business to be kept as quiet as possible
and they will say nothing about their
movements.
It was learned from one of the few
.nen who answered an advertisement,
that the company's representatives had
a lot of contracts for which the appli
cant for a place was obliged to sign
The purport of this contrpct was that
the company agreed to pay to second
class machinists 30 cents an hour for all
work done from the date of their ar
rival at San Francisco. It furthermore
set forth that nine but sober. industri
onus men would be engaged. What
seemed the stumbhline bhloxk to those
who applied was that the applicant was
asked to deposit a gnarantee of $35 to
help defray expenses of transportation
from here to San Fran-is^o, this sum to
be refunded to the employe after six
months of faithful service
Long ftight Expected.
San Francis-o, Aug. 7.-All negotia
tions for a settleument of the labor
trnubles here have resulted in a failure.
and indications are that the strike will
not he ended unirl after a bitter and
protracted struihle
Will Not Hecone Involved.
Cleveland, Aug. 7 -Officials of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineer
and the Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men believe there is little probability of
railway employee becoming involved in
the steel strike. Both organizations
mentioned have provisions in their con
atitutions to prevent sympathetic strikes
and neither organization in such a way
as to make it possible for either to be
come involved in strike of other organ
i.tions in which railroads are not di
rectly implicated.
