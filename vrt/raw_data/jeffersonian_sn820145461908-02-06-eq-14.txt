old stone.
Church Stands on the Line.
The Reformed Church, at Ellerslie, six
miles north of Cumberland, stands on the line,
half in Maryland and half in Pennsylvania.
When the pastor is preaching he talks to a
congregation one-half of which is in Mary
land and one-half in Pennsylvania, and fre
quently steps from one state to the other in
the pulpit. „
In the churchyard is a beautiful marble
crown stone, almost opposite the door of the
church. Besides the coat of arms it bears the
dates 1766 and 1902, as do all the duplicate
stones.
A mound several hundred yards back from
the mountain top, overlooking Ellerslie, has
been surmounted by a plain marker. The
mound was built because in the days of the
original survey it was impossible to get a
marker up the mountain. It would be almost
impossible today were it not for the train
road of a firebrick plant, as the mountain side
is almost perpendicular. The stone was car
ried up on the train road. One tree of good
size is growing on the mound and several oth
ers have sprung up around its edge. —Rich-

ANDERSONVILLE AND CAPT. WIRZ.
Monticello, Ga., Jan. 6, 1908.
There are many false accusations against
Captain Wirz. Northern histries do him
grave injustice, and like many mythical and
malicious statements in other things, those
histories will never teach the Northern people
the truth, but keep falsehood running down
the line for ages to come.
As to Captain Wirz, I can say from a per
sonal knowledge of and close association with
him, that he was a kind, tender-hearted man.
Yet, as a soldier, he made all things sub
servient to duty. He had to appear severe to
the thousands of prisoners; it was in itself a
help, a power, in the control and keeping of
them.
Three small regiments of boys and old men
with inferior guns to hold twenty-three thou
sand enemies! We read and hear much of
‘‘the horrors of Andersonville.” Let’s put
the blame where it belongs. We all thought
it horrid as it came to us then. I was di
rectly under Wirz, a stockade sergeant, call
ing roll daily of 1,620 men, and did not know
twenty of them. We all felt that it was tough
times. As for myself, I ate my twenty-four
hours' rations as soon as it was handed me.
It wouldn’t keep! Everybody too hungry.
Now, how about the highest death rate at
Andersonville? A hard fact, but a plain
truth. At the cook house, near the gate, out
side the stockade, there were on patrole of
honor several men to do the cooking. Salt
was issued to go into bread, and for boiling
beef. The salt was kept out by the paroled
men, who would slip down to the creek and
sell the salt to parties on inside, through spaces
between the logs for the water to pass, and
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
the buyers would sell the salt, the next day,
by the teaspoonful, at exorbitant prices. All
could not buy, for many had no money. How
could the death rate be other than terrible,
when eating corn bread and green beef with
out salt, and drinking limestone water in the
summer time. Now for Caesar!
General Grant refused every proposition to
exchange prisoners; even refused to take them
and keep the Southern prisoners, saying,
4 4 The Southern soldiers will go back into
ranks, and those guarding prisoners will do
the same if we accept those in prison.” I
saw a prisoner hand Sargeant Smith a note
to Captain Wirz; he in turn told his secre
tary, Martin, to write an order, and for
44 Smidt” to tack up inside Stockade, that
4 4 anyone offering salt for sale, that the salt
would be confiscated and the party put in
stocks.
Within forty-eight hours the death rate de
creased wonderfully. Wirz furnished tools
to dig wells. The prisoners dug out of pris
on, when they could, then the well digging
stopped.
4 4 The Providence spring! ’ ’ What a delusion.
How it draws sightseers to Andersonville.
Only a few years ago there were citizens
Lving near who, when children, drank out
out of that spring to and from school. But
it didn’t 44 spout” then. We think an ex
amination would disclose a pipe deeply sunk
in that marshy land alongside the creek. I
did not see any spouting spring when I made
my daily visits into the stockade. I was in
Capt. George Hall’s Company (B, Ist Ga. Re
serves.) Captain Hall, if living, is in Greens
boro, Ga., and many of Company B are still
living in the counties from Athens to Thom
son, Ga., and could be easily found.

FUTURES ON COTTON,
Or
Brother Ben and Joe.
Two honest old farmers, a few weeks ago
(The one christened Ben and the other named
Joe)
While talking Religion were naturally led
To consider the subject of futures ahead.
It is proper to state, and with much due re
spect,
They were brothers devout of the very same
sect.
It is true, their religion said Futures were
Games,
Called it gambling and sinning and other such
names,
But they needn’t tell every one, besides, why,
darnation,
A man’s got a right to a small speculation!
They talked the thing over—resolved once for
all
To be 44 busted” or rich ’fore the first of next
Fall.
And decided between them that Farming was
rotten,
And fortune lay only in Futures in Cotton.
Brother Ben dreamed that night, that at last
it was Fall,
He was gently reclining in some marble hall.
He was playing the fiddle —the strains seemed
to weep,
And he trilled out the Op’ra of 4 4 Rock me to
Sleep! ’ ’
Money, bank-checks, and Futures lay scat
tered around,
Brother Joe had just counted a pile on the r
ground. <
He was rich! Oh, how beautiful all things
now seemed!
And he woke but to hope for the things of
his dream.
Brother Joe dreamt of Hades —that terrible
land
Where the Jew and the Gentile must both
44 gine the band.”
He had never before been in such a hot clime,
And in rage asked the Keeper to tell him his
crime ?
Said the keeper, 44 My Devils, a poker quick
hotten! ’ ’
And he wrote with the poker: 44 Futures on
Cotton!”
At last came the tidings one evening in May
They had anxiously looked for the tidings all
day.
Joey read the thing first; turned as pale as a
sod,
Turned it over to Ben and cried, 4 4 Busted, bv-
Ned!”
Ben wept, for his heart was now cruelly rent
And he said: 44 Brother Joe, they don’t pay
Worth a cent.”
Brother Joe broke in earnest, and left all his
debts *
To be paid by friend Ben, from the Future
assets.
So great this misfortune, that Brother Ben
sighed
As he saw Brother Andrew (a bay horse as
tride)
Coming up to his house (he supposed to con
dole).
So thinking confession was good for the soul,
He told his futures, his hopes and his all,
Os the dream and the fiddle he played in the
hall.
Brother Andrew sighed deeply—oh! Goddess
of Pelf!
He too had tried futures and 44 busted” him
self.
Moral.
All you members of church with a long face
on Sunday,
Don’t curse 44 0 n the sly” and buy futures
on Monday.
If surrender you will to the awful tempta
tion,
4 4 Thinking you have a right to a small specu
lation,”
You’ll be in the end into hot Hades gotten
And punished like Joe for your futures in cot
ton.
