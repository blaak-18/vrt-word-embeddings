SERENADE.
Dark is the iris iiifeddoWj
Dark is the ivory tower,
And lightly the young moth’s shadow
Sleeps on the passion flower.
Gone are our day’s red roses,
•Lovely and lost and few,
But the first star uncloses
A silver bud in the blue.
Night, and a flatne in the embers
When the seal of the years was set;
When the almond bough remembers
How shall my heart forget 1 ?

HOUSECLEANING MANIA.
Have you symptoms of houseclean
ing mania ? If so, lose no time in
having it cured, for there is scarcely
any other form of mania that causes
so much wretchedness.
There was once a woman living in
a small Illinois city who was afflicted
with this disease in its worst form.
She lived In an outwardly beautiful
house, the interior of which, however,
was a tomb, a prison, a cold place
which chilled in mind, body and spir
it, every one who entered its doors.
Neighbors seldom called the second
time. If a thread chanced to fall
(from their clothing or a speck of dirt
from their shoes, Mrs. M. promptly
brought in broom and dustpan (she
could keep no maid) and in the very
presence of her guests took up the of
fending particles.
If a relative, sufficiently courage
ous to remain over night in this house
of gloom, chanced to place a sheet on
the bed wrong side out or upside
down, it did not long escape the eagle
eye of my lady of the broom and dust
pan, who promptly whisked it off and
reprimanded the guest for her disord
erly habits. The washstand pitchers
must always be replenished to a cer
tain point, and if t'he person supplying
these with water failed to heed this
rule the defect had to be remedied,
even though it meant an extra trip
from the third floor to the basement.
T'he husband and five sons were
never permitted to pass beyond the
threshold when coming in, before tak
ing off their shoes, and the youngest
of the flock knew to his physical and
mental hurt what it meant should one
of his toys chance to get iteyond the
corner of a certain room.
As to sunshine, there never was
any in this house: the rugs were of
more value to this woman than the
health of her family.
The fireplace never served its legi
timate purpose, because of the ashes
which might be scattered about t’he
house.
What was the cause of this abnor
mal care? The husband was a crushed,
cowed, miserable nonenity in the house
which his money had paid for, a butt
among t’he men with whom he tran
sacted business, a rapidly deteriorat
ing being—becoming daily more and
more unfit to cope with less fettered,
therefore, more brilliant, minds than
his.
The sons —denied cheer and peace
in the home, and the privilege of en-
Under The Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
tertaining their friends—'found vent
for their exuberant young spirits (that
is for so much as had not been
(irUshed Out of existence) in the gamb
ling hiali and saloon.
There was not a waking moment of
this woman’s life that she was not
thinking of her house —not her home™
and looking for dust or dirt of one
kind or another.
In the desire to keep the kettles
and pans bright, she became blind to
t’he actual needs of her family! She
forgot that they we/i’e souls. She
could not understand the words which
fell from the lips of the orator, for
he spoke of beauty and beauty did not
companion with the grime and ashes
which constantly beclouded her mind.
She failed to see the charm of a
painting, because imaginary dust ob
scured her vision.
She felt no uplift in the sunlight,
for it meant to her more dust; she
saw no gladness in the cooling clouds,
for they brought rain, and rain pro
duced mud which careless neighbors
would carry into her house!
Dear mothers, if you find yourselves
in a nervous tremor whenever the door
opens to admit one of your - friends,
or when your little son or daughter
bursts into the house with song and
laughter, or your husband’s cheery
tones are heard in the hall, because
you fear a track may be left on the
kitchen floor, or t’he parlor rug, or a
chair may be moved from the place
where you set it, or a part of the
evening paper carelessly thrown on
the floor —then you have strong sympt
oms of housecleaning madness, and
it should not be permitted to con
tinue for another day.
If you feel this dreadful disease
or mania stealing upon you, go out
more among your neighbors. Spend
all the time possible out-of-door*.
Take a long walk every day. Ob
serve poeple. Study the sky, the trees,
the birds, the flowers. Read whole
some literature, including wit and hu
mor. Eat sufficient nutritious food,
masticating it slowly; drink pleenty of
pure water. Open the doors and win
dows of your home, that air and sun
shine may reach every corner. Make
it a haven of rest, a place of joy and
gladness, the dearest spot on earth to
your family, yourself t’he queen, the
companion, the confidant, and the
blessing of health, youth and peace
may be yours throughout all the com
ing years. —Woman’s Work.
WOMAN AND THE CHILD-SLAVE.
The average man may dismiss with
but little consideration the question
whether or not there is an army com
posed of men and women who are
both willing and anxious to work. The
man who owns ia home may thought
lessly and ignorantly assert that there
-is no “bread line.” Possibly but few
of us read the late Carroll D. Wright’s
“Eighteenth Annual Report,” but
could we roll back the curtains we
would read a story behind the returns,
a story of hardships pitiful in the
extreme, a story of privation never
dreamed of by the black slaves.
In the census of 1890 we find 51.1
Jeffersonian
per cent unemployed, in that of 1900
22.3 per cent and in the Eighteenth
Annual Labor Report 49.81 per cent
unemployed. 56.96 per cent of the
unemployed were so far from “’being
unable to get work —establishment
closed—slack work.” We all know or
should know that we have a vast
army of unemployed an nd many of us
know from better experience that the
“bread line” is a stern reality. But
it is so hard to know —so hard to
help others to know why.
While the use of new and improved
machinery is ever to decrease the de
mand for skilled labor to the use of
this same machinery is due the in
crease in production, for instance;
“Under the old hand method it re
quired 118 hours to make one land
slide plow. Today with modern ma
chinery it requires less than 4 hours.
“The worker of oday produces 30
plows in the same lengh of time it for
merly required o make one ploy. ’’ One
doesn’t need to be a college graduate
to understand that. To the man who
owns his home and disbelieves in the
honesty of the “bread line,”
I would say that in 1903
only 10.6 per cent, of the workers
owned their homes free; 8.3 per cent,
were mortgaged, 81.1 per cent, rented,
and no doubt the number of rented
dwelling places (not homes) is even
greater now. We might go on with
startling facts and calculating figures,
but still the fact remains that were
the average American family without
work for a few weeks they, too, would
find themselves a part of that never
ending “bread line.” A wonvan in
the “bread line” because she is dis
honest ? Great God, no! Is it because
a woman is dishonest that she takes
a place in t’he field, the shop or fac
tory ? Can you conceive of any cause
except the fear of starvation that will
drag the mother from her child into
the cotton mill?
Think you that because many of
these mothers are uncultured that they
lack the Divine essence of womanhood,
mother love? And just here let me add
that had the vast amount of money
spent in foreign fields been spent to
advantage at home as it should have
been, our mothers could not have
called ignorant. Shame on us! Can
you believe that the normal mother is
glad to see the factory engulf her
child? 1 have worked with these lit
tle burden bearers, have talked with
them, have seen them work all day
and far into t’he night on and on until
they seem as parts of the machinery
which they operate.. After a lapse
of years the thought of the little
soiled hands and tired eyes is horrid
to me and how a mother can endure
it is more than I can say. Let those
who will prate of “race suicide,” but
the cruelty, the inhumanity of crush
ing child-life into profits is enough to
make a woman who would be a true
mother stop and think. Could I
bear the idea of my child’s being in
she “’bread line”? Could I bear for
my child to suffocate in a cotton mill?
My God, no. If needs must be let
the “bread line” be my lot, if there
is no other way let me fill a place in
a cotton miUj but God forbid that I
should be the mother of one more
child slave. The mothers are, it is
true, strangely silent, but to protect ai
nations child-life motheifaood will yet
assert itself, for not always will wo
man be content to carry on the work
of reproduction for the profit Os the
Hill’s, Harriman’s, Rockefeller’s, et
al. The thousands of wee mounds scat
tered all over the land are enough to
make despoiled motherhood cry out:
“Who would seek or prize
Delights that end in aching?
Who would trust to ties ' •
That every hour are breaking?
Better far to be
In utter darkness lying
Than to be blessed with light and see
That light forever flying,
All that’s sweet must fade
The brightest still the fleetest
All that’s sweet was made
But to be lost when sweetest. ’’
George Martin.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
Some men s minds are a blank on
all public questions if left to them
selves, but they are generally the loud
est shouters in the gang when follow
ing the push.
The standard for self-satisfaction
in the human mind, on public ques
tions, embraces a wide range; some
are best satisfied as followers, some as
imitators, some are never satisfied un
less striving for something new or
better than the present; while others
are continually shouting, “Let well
enough alone.”
On all public questions, a follower
may do some good, providing he fol
lows the right leaders; the imitator
may do the same; one honestly striv
ing for better things will do more
good and get less credit than any
other, but the shooter to let well
enough alone is the most worthless
toad in the puddle.
Late mint and other statistical re
ports show that our government takes
$10,000,000 tribute from the silver
miners, and pays $20,000,000 per year
graft to the national banks.
If our representatives at Washing
ton were honest enough to stop the
graft to national banks, and do jus
tice to silver, our government would
still be $10,000,000 ahead for legiti
mate expenses.
For a government to take $10,000,-
000 per year tribute from labor in, a
legitimate industry, and pay $20,000,-
000 per year graft to bankers is self
evident proof that fools or knaves do
the governing.
♦
The people generally get the kind
of government they demand and vote
for; therefore, it is also self-evident
that all the fools or knaves are not
sent to Washington.
The evils done in public life by
fools, knaves, anarchists, or partisan
fanatics, of any party, are too near
alike to attempt a distinction,
