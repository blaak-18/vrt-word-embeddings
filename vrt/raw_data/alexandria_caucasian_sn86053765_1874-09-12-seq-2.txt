The Fair Association .—-Tlie
Board ot Directors ot' Urn Associa
tion held n meeting at the Fair
Grounds on Tuesday Instant! made
some important changes and addi
tions to the Rule», Regulations and
Premium List, which appear else
where in this issue iu the shape of
advertisements. New aud large
buildings are now being erected on
the grounds aud by the time of the
opening of the Fair ou October lDtli,
most ample and complete arrange
ments will have been made for the
proper display of all articles enter
ed aud for the caro and accommo
dation of stock etc.
It is expected that every body
will have something to en ter for the
liberal premiums offered, and it is
the duty of cvory man, woman and
child in Rapides to assist in this
enterprise which seeks to develop
and build up the material interests
of our parish.
M b. J onas R osenthal .—This en
terprising gentleman, not to be out
done by bis neighbors of Front
Street, has also jnst returned from
the city with a full stock of goods, as
will bo seen from his card under the
bead of new advertisements in thin
issue. Wc are warranted in assuring
our readers that they can find every
thing they want, and can be suited
ns to quality and price by calling on
Jonas at the corner of Second and
.Murray Street He is always on
hand with the cash to pay for Cotton,
hides &c., and pays the highest
price for them and all other articles
• »f country prodnce. Dont forget the
«•laims of Jonas for a fair share ol
}our patronage.

Our readers have doubtless, seen
and read the letters of instructions
from the President of the United
States, to the Secretary of War, di
recting that United States troops
be placed at the disposal of the At
torney General, for the protection
of all citizens in their rights, in
those localities, where outrages are
snid to have been committed. It is
useless to comment oil the vile mis
representations of our enemies M ho
have induced the President and
Northern pnpers to believe, that
the lite, liberty and property ol the
negroes, in this State arc in jeopar
dy. Sooner or later perhaps the
true state of affiiirs will be known
and understood throughout the civ
ilized world, and the outrages and
wrongs that have been heaped up
on the white people and property
holders of all the Southern States,
by Radical emissaries protected by
the Federal government, be record
ed on the blackest page in our
country's history. For the present
let our people bo not discouraged
or become lukewarm as there is no
excuse for it. Troops even they are
sent hero cannot chango the condi
tion of affairs or interfere atall with
tlio rights of our people. Wo have
troops stationed now at Colfax and
had them here during the election of
1871Î, and it made no difference with
tho result. The idea that we are
watched by Federal bayonets, may
intimidate tho weak, but not one,
who is sincerely aud devotedly at
tached to Iiis cause, and who de
sires good government. Ba just,
bo bold, and fear not. in tho dis
charge of every duty 5 at the mere
appearance of force will not change
the result. Tho negro fully under
stand that Iroops are not always
to remain here, and they have at
last learned that their white lead
crs liavo been using them merely as
tools to subserve their „own vile
purposes.
Wo have perfect peace in this
parish with the rights of all protect
ed, and the White Man's Party has
emphatically declared that the
rights of the negroes shall bo tin
molested, and all wo wish or ask is
fair play, and this we will have.—
Ono word of caution, however, to
all parties. To our friends we say,
let no unprovoked act of bloodshed
or vielenee bo imputed to us for po
litical purposes. Let every one
register and vote as he sees fit. To
the negroes wo say, that because
your leaders will attempt to em
bolden you to acts of violence, and
will teach you that the troops if
sent, will be entirely for your pro
tection iu every aggressive act that
you may commit, beware ol such
teachings as you alone will be the
sufferers.
Mus. Sahati Mayer .—By refer
enco to her advertisement in anolh
ther column it will bo seen that
Mrs.- Sarah Mayer has just received
aud opened a new and full stock of
goods, which aro fresh and well
selected. Wo liavo taken occasion
to look in on Moses who is always
smiling and ready to show his
goods, ami we found tho store
chuck full with the prettiest, cheap
est and neatest assortment of goods
that we liavo seen in many a, day.
Calicos of every shade, color and
variety, best family flour, barrels
upon top of barrels, clothing, boots,
shoes and hats, hoops upon hoops
and notions and fancy articles with
out limit arc arranged in neat and
tasty order in tho shelves and
makes an attractive array. You
may go further and faro woiso than
by calling on Mrs. Sarah Mayer at
once. She says she cannot bo un
dersold. Try and seel
M oses R osenthal —This old
time and respected merchant, who
was one of our antebellum stand
by's has just returned from New
Orleans with a full and complete
assortment of goods for tho fall
trade and merits both on his own
account and because of his excel
lent stock of goods, a full share of
patronage, which we know he will
receive. His advertisement in an
other place makes known what he
has on his shelves and purchasers
will consult their iutrresto by giv
ing him a cull.
To tho Citizens of Bapidos Parish.
Your Esocutive Committee, have
thought it proper at this time to ad
dress you a few words of encour
agement and caution. The oflieos
for registration have been fixed at
suitable and satisfactory places and
the registration is now quietly pro
gressing ; tho election precints and
election commissioners as just ap
pointed by tho Police Jury are en
tirely satisfactory to us and fair for
both sides. These indications lead
ns to believe that there is no inten
tion ou the part ot our political op
ponents to attempt any traud or to.
prevent a free and fair registration
and election in this parish. Your
committee have not, however, re
lied upon their promise nor are they
lulled into inactivity by the fairness
of the preparations so far made lor
the election which is approaching,
but have taken every precaution to
insure a fair election and they guar
antee to you that they will bo vigi
lant and watchful until the election
shall have been held aud until eve
ry vote shall have been fairly count
e'd. They are prepared to deal with
any attempt at fraud or chicanery
on tho part of the radical negro par
ty and they bold themselves respon
sible to you for the conduct of tho
campaign to a peaceable, quiet and
fair conclusion.
Without intending to intimato
and without believing that such ad
vice is necessary or called for by
any contemplated action of yours,
they feel that they would fail in the
duty they owe you, if they did not
eounscl such forbearance, caution
and circumspection on your part
during this campaign, as will de
feat the clear purpose of our politi
cal enemies to provoke us to acts of
violence, which while they might be
perfectly justifiable in themselves,
would by them be distorted into
being evidences of lawlessness on
our part and would serve them to
make political capital against us.—
Let us be quiet, and peaceable, but
tirm and resolved and tho victory
is ours in this parish. The only
hope of tho radicals is that wo will
lose the fruits of our victory by acts
which will furnish a pretext upon
which to throw out tho vote iu this
p irish.
We are satisfied that we have a
majoiity of votes in Rapides, and
ir they all register and vote, as we
believe they will of their "own ac
cord, and are determined they shall,
if solicitation bo necessary, we will
once again have tho government of
our parish iu our own hands. Bo
ready to repel any invasion of our
rights, bo firm and resolved that
you will not submit to any fraud
or interference with r his election
either on the part of Kellogg or tho
United States authorities, but act
only when the emergency cannot
be avoided and all will be well.
Register yourselves and see that,
all your neighbors register and vote,
for the issues at stake are too im
portant to allow any man to hold
back and the citizen who fails now
to register and vote is unworthy
the name of freedom, and deserves
tobe the slave of tho negro as he
will be, and all of us will be, if we
fail to win this election through the
negligence and hikcwarinness ol
any of those who are interested in
defeating the corrupt radical party
at the electio:; ,and restoring our
beloved State to tho hands of the
honest and intelligent people.
