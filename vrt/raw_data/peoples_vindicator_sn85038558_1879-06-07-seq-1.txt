WORM SPECIFIC
OR
*VERMIFUGE.
SYMPTOMS OF WORMS
THE countenance is pale and lead.
en-colored, with occasional flushes,
w a circumscribed spot on one or both
cheeks; the eyes become dull: the
pupils dilate; an azure semicircle
runs along the lower eye-lid: the
nose is irritated, swells, and sometimes
bleeds; a swelling of the upper lip;
occasional headache, with humming
or throbbing of the ears; an unusual
secretion of saliva; slimy or furred
tongue; breath very foul, particularly
in the morning; appetite variable,
sometimes voracious, with a gnawing
sensation of the stomach, at others,
entirely gone; fleeting pains in the

nied by hiccough; cough sonitimes

THE CONVENTION.
Coasideration of the Case of Rivert vs.
Augustim - The Seat Finally De.
elared Vacant sad the ques
tion Remitted to the Pea.
ple-A New Election to
be Held.
WEDNESDAY, May 21.
The Convention was called to or.
der at 2 o'clock, President Wilts in
the chair and 100 members present.
Prayer was offused by the Rev. Mr.
Gntheimn.
Delegate LeGardear, chairman of
the Committee on Militia, presented
an ordinance upon the subject of the
militia, which was ordered to be
printed.
THE CASE OF RIVET VS. AUGUSTIN.
The special order of the day, being
the contested election case of Rivet
vs. Augustin, was taken up and the
majority and minority reports were
read.
Delegate Girard, chairman of the
Committee on Elections, moved the
adoption of the majority report, and
an accompanying resolution, declar
ing that Mr. Rivet was entitled to the
seat. He reviewed the testimony
taken before the committee and gave
the reasons that actuated the isajor
ity In, making up their report.
Delegate Jastremski urged the adope
tion of the minority report, deemlaing
lthat there had been no fair ehection,
and favoring a new election, giving
the reasons which actuated him in
signing that report.
Delegate LeGardeur argued that ]
the evidence showed that frads had I
been committed by Mr. Rivet's friends I
and he urged that they were sufficient
to elect Mi. Augustin. He, therefore, (
favored the confirmation of that geo
tleman in his seat.
Delegate McGloil favored the ad
option of the majority report. He
argued that all the testimony went to I
show that Mr. Rivet was elected, and I
he felt compelled on his conscience to
vote to seat him. He then reviewed (
the case at some length.
Delegate WaImoth favored the
minority report, declaring that the t
case should be sent back to the pea
Ide. lie argued, from the testimony, I
that neither of the gentlemen were
elected,; and elosed with.nmo remarks
concerning natives of Louisiana), ur
ging that while both the contestant
and the contestee were natives of the
State, those who committed the I
frauds at the first poll of the fifth
ward were unscrupulous and irresa
ponssible carpetLbaggers, as a matter I
of course.
Delegate Cunningham trusted noaJ
member of the Convention would i
take offense at the sneering remarks I
of the gentleman from Plaqemines.
When he reflected that the first time I
he ever heard of the gentleman was
that he, while a very young man, I
just after the war, was in Washington I
endeavoring to have the State of Lou. I
isiana thrown Into a territorial con- I
dition in order that he might role it; I
that soon thereafter he became her
Governor; that although he said a I
few days a-o his government was not (
very strong or far-reaching, it was I
strong enough and far-reaching I
enough to tickle the most remote bal- I
lot-box in this State and made it .
bring forth a fnll blown radieal o11 •
ehal; that he could reach forth his
han ad and a Lewis and a Wheyland 4
.would be returnerad to the Legislature !
from Sabine, where or Republican I
votet was scarcely ever east; that it
was stroneg and far reaebinf enough •
to enable hi to reach into the ftute I
and partake pf the substance of pros- I
perity, sad that now there were none I
s poor or me.anrs tlive hoed to I
any opinion he might; eipres., the l
speaker was net aurprised that lie
slhnuld despise and sneer at the peo- ]
pile he had wronged. The gentleman
had Iis lcharitable conasjideratiou and I
ymopathy. In taksln * philosophieal I

Webster Tribune : A bountiful
corn clop has been planted. .On the
most forward. farms corn is five and
six feet high, and tasselling. Some
farmers complain of two much grass
to the acre iu their cotton-fields.
The Markaville Blletin says : The

they need agood shower. The coMn

in a few days go into tassels. The
cotton is growing very well, the pres
ent dry weather not injuring it at all.
Carroll Conservative: The dwel.
Rng house of Irvin Davis and family
on the Holly plantation was discover
ed to be on fire. The inmates were
driven out by the dense smoke, losing
nearly every thing they had. The
entire building was destroyed is at
very few moments, supposed to be
the work of an incendiary.
Shreveport SBtndard: Mr. Gleason,
a farmer, living in the nothern part i
of Webster parish, had his crops of I
cotton and corn totally destroyed by º
a recent bail storm.- A very fine,
large hog was killed as dead as a I
door nail by the falling hail stopes. I
The bail which fell in the northern I

Claihorne Ogardian was the heaviest
ever known. The stones averaged
the sise of a hen's egg, and fell to
the thiekness of a foot on level ground.
The drift in fence corners on the fol

a lowing:
Mr. IH. P.'Peer, of Teeterville, Ont.,
c accomplished the daring but silly feat
of jumping from the new Suspension
Bridge at Niagaw Falls, into the river
below, a distance of J1I2 feet.' This
entirely eclipses the famous perform
ance of Sam Patch.. Peer's dress con
sisted of merino hope and i full suit
of tights, an inflited ribber' life pre.
server, funnel shaped and of hId own
construction, which covered. his iips
and extended up to tihe armpits. Cot
ton cloth was bandaged tightly over
the preserver, about the hips and
loius, while a broad sponge protected
his mouth and .uestrils and his ears
were stuffed with the same material,
the sponge being slightly moistened
I with spirits. His thights were con
Sfined with an elastic strap and like
wise his feet. Over his shoulders
was a leatherbrace with a ring in
the centre to which was attached a
cable composed of 220 feet of No. 24
brass wire in six strands. This was
called a balance and was for the pur.
pose of assisting to retain his position,
particularly if the wind should be
strong. It was reeled over a ylinde
attached to the guard-rail of the
bridge and which was operated with
brake.handle lie tat usneed upon
old time wells so that the man's speed
as he descended could be 'controlled
to a certain extent. It was not fast- I
ened and the final end followed the
man into the water. Mr. Peer took
his place upon the temporary plat- i
form from which he was to drop. The,
platform consisted simply of two .1
planks fastened about eighteen inches
apart. After taking a little stimo - I
lant and displaying a little nervous. I
ness, for this was his greatest under- l
taking, he suspended himself between ,
the boards, for a moment or two by l
his hands., The word was given and
he wasgone like a lash, while the
thousand spectators who Ined the ,
bank looked' on with suspense, fear
and tranbling. The four secends
that intervened before he struck
created a terrible excitement, bpt as
he passed under the water feet fore- .
most with a great splash, and eame
tap in a few secoeds more and began
to swim, cheer after. chq m tqt the
air.' je was picked up by some boat
men and la'in no worse `ondition
than if he had jumped into a clestern
of water. In fact be assisted to pull
the boat to the shore. Mr. Peer. was
born July 14, 1844, in the county of I,
Halton, township of Nelson,' Do6in, a
ion of Canada. e stands 5 feet 7j '
