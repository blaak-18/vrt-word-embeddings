What Our Farmers Are Saying and Doing
CULTIVATION OF SMALL
ACREAGE.
I guess every land owner has met
the renter who will come and look
over a good-sized farm and then tell
you it is hardly as much land as he
would like to tend. I have had this
experience, and have had the renter
to decide to take the farm and then
plant about one-third of it.
One of the worst mistakes made by
the tenant is trying to spread out
over too much land. If he would cul
tivate a small number of acres and
fertilize and work it well he would
have better results with less expense
and less work. It would be a lesson
to some of them if they could see
some little farms of foreigners and
even some gardens in cities cultivated
by people who are not handicapped
by the notion that they can do noth
ing unless they have several hundreds
of acres to tend.
The farmer can always count on
diversified crops for some of them are
sure to hit. He can make a success
of cattle raising if he will raise his
own feed, and there is no danger of
the poultry business ever being over
run, for we are sure that the supply
will never meet the demand.
Let the tenant quit trying to culti
vate too much land, and what he
does let him do it well.

EXTRACTS FROM THE SPEECH
OF COL. JOEL B. FORT AT
YANCEYVILLE, N. C.
“Ladies and fellow citizens, 133
years ago yesterday marked an era
in the history of nations; an era when
manhood and might arose and threw
off the tyranny of the British crown.
They were your ancestors and mine.
The same blood courses through your
veins and mine. I am proud of the
fact that I am descended from the
good old North Carolina stock, and
I want to do my little mite toward the
happiness of my fellow man. If per
chance our ancestors should look
down upon us today, they would see
a pitiable sight. Are we a race of
freemen or slaves bowing down at the
foot of some power other than God?
It was a principle our fathers con
tended for, and not the tea tax. They
could have drunk something else —I
thank you liquor was plentiful and
very cheap then.
“Thank God the same blood flows
in my veins as that which prompted
the North Carolinians to say to the
advancing enemy: ‘Fire and be damn
ed.’ I want to appeal to you for a
higher and nobler thing than the get
ting of a little money. When a man
begins to love money more than his
fellow man he forgets the purpose
for which God created him. When
the flower of affection dies in a man’s
heart he becomes a cold and merci
less being. I quit politics because I
couldn’t follow the principles of the
higher and nobler law and be a suc
cessful politician. When a man gets
to wanting money too much he’ll
steal. We must love our fellow man
as well as God. When a man wor
ships God and doesn’t love his neigh
bor he’ll go to hell as fast as if he
loved his neighbor and not God. You
do the greatest good when you help
your neighbor. lam not here to stir
you up. I came not with blood in
my eye and thunder in my tone. I
came with a rose in my heart. I came
with seeds of good will to scatter,
that you may love your neighbor bet
ter, that you may build up the coun
try home, which is presided over by
the farmer’s wife, the glorious wo
man who gives to the land of Ameri
ca the choicest of citizenship the
grandeur of patriotism and glory to
the American nation. I came to stand
for the man that God made and the
higher and nobler plan of life. In the
fight that is coming for organization,
we want an army of men to stand for
right and eternally against the
wrong.
“I’ve heard since coming to Blanch
that the' agents of the trust were tell
ing that I had sold out. What if I
had? What if one man should sell
out? Is it any reason that the rest
should give up the fight? Isn’t it
more shame that the trust should
bribe a man? They’ve told that I was
a ‘night rider’—l who have lifted my
voice in the mountains of Tennessee
against the very thing, and whose
life has been threatened and assault
ed. They may kill me, but what I
have said will live on and on. I say
what I please and I acknowledge no
master save God alone.
“There has been, and always will
be, a contest between the buyer and
the seller. The buyer wants the prod
uct as cheap as possible, and the sell
er wants the price as high as possi
ble. The tobacco grower is willing
for the issue between the buyer and
the seller to be tried in the court of
supply and demand, with a just and
unbiased judge, before an impartial
jury. The trust has packed the jury,
owns, controls and pays the judge,
and the tobacco grower will no longer
submit to such a farce of trial, to such
a fraud on the name of a sale.
“Who decides whether or not there
is an over-production of tobacco? The
trust. Who fixes the price on the
growers’ tobacco? The trust. It even
fixes the price before the seed are
sown in the plant bed. The trust
employs agents, and to them the or
der is given, average price is given,
which they are allowed to pay. The
agent has no discretion in the mat
ter. The warehousemen may appeal
as much as he will, but the orders
are like the laws of the Medes and
Persians unyielding and unalterable.
“So far the law has been powerless
to give relief. So far the issue has
been tried alone by the trust, and the
blight and ruin and poverty which
has fallen to the lot of the tobacco
grower left him without remedy.
What will you do? Will you sit su
pinely by and allow the matter to go
on from bad to worse? There is a
remedy, and you have it in your own
hands. By organizing, and by pool
ing your interest, you present the one
seller to cope with the one buyer;
you have the product, and the buyer
must have it. Is it not just that you
should fix the price of your tobacco,
which you have grown at an immense
amount of hard labor, rather than
Jeffersonian
have the price fixed by the trust?
You say I know this can be done, and
it will benefit the whole country, and
bring prosperity and hope when we
now have poverty and depression, if
the farmers would just unite. Then
why don’t you do it? You are the
very man who stands apart and re
fuses to fall in line to remedy the
evil. You have no right to ask an
other to do for you what you won’t
do for yourself. A man is a coward
and an ingrate who would have his
neighbor defend his home, while he
hides in the bushes. Is it not a part of
the history of North Carolina and
Virginia that her sons were never
found in the rear or lagging in de
fense of our country, or in the up
building of the material interests of
the country? The battle is on,
men of North Carolina. There is no
middle ground. ‘Choose ye this day
whom ye will serve.’ Choose this
day whether you will stand idly by
and allow the tobacco trust to con
tinue its robbery, continue its frauds
and oppressions on your people, or
whether you will fall in line and by
one concerted action, brother to
brother, neighbor to neighbor, stand
for and upbuild the interests of your
State The hard worked housewife,
the ragged, bare-foot, uneducated
children plead in thunder tones for
your help, shall it be withheld? Can
you resist such a sacred call to duty?
“I want to see you fall in man to
man. I want to see your solid col
umns of patriotic men sweep the ene
my from the field and place anew the
rose of health in the wan cheek of the
over-worked housewife. I want to
see you dot every section of our old
State with school houses and filled
with well fed and well clothed chil
dren, for they are the friend and hope
of the future. I want to see the worn
and waste places, poor on account of
cheap tobacco, sewed up and restored
to their former fertility, and I want
to hear the song of hope and the song
of prosperity ring in every valley and
on every hilltop of my old mother
State of North Carolina.”—Sentinel,
Yanceyville, N. C.
RAISE SWEET POTATOES FOR
FEED.
Messrs. Editors: —The hog cholera
struck my hogs last fall just at the
time to put them up. I had a very
large quantity of potatoes I had rais
ed, expecting to feed to my hogs.
Consequently I had to dispose of them
as best I could after I lost several of
my hogs. There was a large per cent,
of them Hamans, which, of course,
are not at all salable on the market.
Therefore, I have fed them freely to
my mules, feeding two-thirds feed of
potatoes in place of corn in connec
tion with peavine hay and shredded
corn fodder.
They have kept in fine order, and I
am sure it will pay well to feed the
sweet potatoes to stock from four to
six months in the year.
The Hamans are the best keepers
of any kind I have tried and they pro
duce very abundantly.
All farmers who have not fixed to
grow potatoes for feed for stock
should now begin and put in a good
quantity, as they seem to be a fine
crop to balance the field peas. I have
found no other crop that balances the
field pea so well as sweet potatoes.
Hogs will not fatten nearly so fast
on the field peas and potatoes as they
will on the ground peas. But we
should make a specialty of growing
the field pea for the special benefit of
the land, as there is not any other
legume to well suited to thin, sandy
land as the field pea. By observation
I find that hogs will eat about two
thirds feed of potatoes to one-third
of peas. My tenant has raised 1,350
pounds of very good pork almost en
tirely with peas and potatoes.
It is best to arrange the potato
patches so as the hogs can have access
to both peas and potatoes at the same
time. After the weather gets cold
have the potatoes hilled or placed
convenient, so as to feed with as lit
tle trouble as possible. Do not fail
to feed potatoes freely in latter part.
of the time hogs are running on peas,
especially in December. —H. M. John
son. in Progressive Farmer.
