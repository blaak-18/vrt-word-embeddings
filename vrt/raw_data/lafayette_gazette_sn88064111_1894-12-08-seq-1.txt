THE JUDGE'S TROUT.
Why He Fed It to the Charcoal
Burner's Daughter.
"Scholastiquel"
"'M. Sourdat."
"Take the utmost pains in cooking
the trout-short boil, white wine,
parsley, thyme, laurel, oil and onions
in full strength."
After having uttered these last in
junctions to his cook, Judge Sourdat
crossed the chief street of Maryville
with alert steps and gained the palais
de justice, which was situated back
of the Sons prefecture. Judge Sourdat
was about forty-five years of age;
very active, notwithstanding a ten
dency to stoutness; square of
shoulders, short in stature, with a
squeaking voice and a round, close
shaven head; eyes gray, clear and
hard under bushy. yebrows; a mouth
closely shut, with thin and irritable
lips; browned cheeks, surrounded
with whiskers badly trimmed; in fact,
one of those mastiff faces, of which
one says: "He can't be good every
day." And surely he was not very
kind, and he boasted of it. A despot,
he used all of his little realm in the
palais. Hard as stone toward the
guilty, rough with the witnesses, ag
gressive with the advocates, he was a
veritable furnace who fanned himself
constantly into a glow. He was feared
like the flre, and he was loved very
little.
Hlowever his man of iron had two
vulnerable Ues. Firstly, he responded
to the pa ral name of Hemorin.
which exp ed him to ridicule, and
secondly, was a gourmand, and
gave point to Brillat Savarin. Ilis
gastronomya which was profound, had
become a m nia.
It was l1 who imagined that to
plunge shelltish into boiling water be
fore cooking them in their ordinary
dressing gave them a richness and vel
vety savor particularly exquisite. On
the day when he taught that latest re
finement to the priest of St. Victor the
latter could not help blushing, and
raising his puffy hands to heaven he
cried: "Too much! This is too much,
Judge Sourdat! Assuredly it is per
mitted to taste with discretion the
good things which divine wisdom has
provided, but such sensuality as this
borders upon mortal sin, and you will
have to render account for it to the
good God."
To the scruples of the excellent
priest the judge responded with a mis
anthropic laugh. It was one of his
malign joys to expose his neighbors to
temptation, and this very morning the
priest was to breakfast with him, the
recorder being the only other guest.
Judge Sourdat had received the even
ing before a two-pound salmon trout
taken from the beautiful clear water
of the rocky Semois. It was his fa
vorite fish, and had fully occupied the
first hours of his morning, lie had
demonstrated to the cook the superior
ity of a quick boil to the slow cook
ing in Geneva or Holland sauce of the
books The trout must be served cold
and in the seasoning in which it was
cooked.
This was with him a principle as
well as a dogma. as indispensable as
an article of the penal code. lie con
tinued to repeat it to himself after
having clothed himself in his robe and
taken his seat, though he was turning
over the leaves of a document bearing
upon an important case now pending.
This was a criminal affair, the dra
matic details of which contrasted
singularly with the epicurian specula
tions which persisted in haunting the
cranium of Judge Sourdat.
The case was thus: IDuring the pre
vious week at sunrise there had been
found in the thicket of a forest the
body of a gamekeeper, who had evi
dently been assassinated and then con
cealed among the brambles of a ditch.
It was supposed that the crime had
been committed by some strolling
poacher, but up to the present time
there had been elicited no precise evi
dence and the witnesses examined had
only made the mystery deeper.
The nmurder had taken place near the
frontier, where charcoal burners were
at work. The suspicions of the judge
had, therefore, been directed toward
them. The depositions thus far had
revealed that on the night of the mur
dler these people had been absent from
their shanty and the furnaces had re
mained in the care of a young daugh
ter of the charcoal burner.
Toward ten o'clock the door of his
cabinet opened, framing the cocked
hat and yellow shoulder belt of the
constable.
"Eh! well?" grunted the judge.
"Eh! well, judge, I cannot find the
girl. She has disappeared. The char
-oal burners pretend utter ignorance."
The judge consulted his watch. The
business was at a standstill; the case
zonld not be called, and he wished to
rive a glance of oversight to the mat
ters of the dining-room before the ar
rival of his guests. He disrobed him
self and hurried home.
The pleasant dining-room, bright
sned by the June sunshine, presented
a most .ttractive aspect, with its
white woodwork, its gray curtains, its
3igh stove of blue faience with its
marble top, and its round table cov
ared with a dazzling white linen cloth,
apon which were placed three covers
artistically trimmed.
This spectacle softened the ill-humor
af the judge, and he was calming lit
tie by little, while laying upon the sil
ver salver a dusty bottle of old croton,
when the hall door opened violently,
and he heard in the vestibule a girl's
roice,which cried: "'I tell you I wish to
speak to the judge. He expects me."
"What does this racket mean?"
growled the judge, scowling.
"If is that little charcoal burner,"
responded the recorder, Touchboeuf.
"'She arrived at the palais just after
you left, and she has followed me as
far as here, in a state of wild excite
ment, in order that you may take her
tepsitiot"
"Eh|" groaned the judge. "You are
:n a great hurry, my girl, after keep
img me waiting three days. Why did
Tou Set tuese oePner?"
"I had my reasons.," she said, casting
hungry eyes upon the table.
"We can better appreciate your rea
sons later," replied the judge, furious
at the interruption. "Meanwhile we
can listen to your report."
He drew out his watch. It was 10:45.
"Yes, we have time, Touchboeuf. You
will find at your side all that is neces
sary for writing. VWe will question
her."
The notary seated himself at the
writing table with his paper and ink
stand and the pen behind his ear,
waiting. The judge, sitting squarely
in a cane-seated armchair, fixed his
clear, hard eyes upon the girl, whq
remained standing near the stove.
"Your name?" he demanded.
"Meline Sacael."
"Your age and your residence?"
"Sixteen years. I live with-my fa.
ther, who burns charcoal at the clear
ing of Onze-Fontaine."
"You swear to tell all the truth?"
"I came only for that."
"Raise your right hand. You were
near your home on the night when the
guard Sourrot was murdered. Relate
all that you know."
"That is what I know: Our folks
had set out to go with the charcoal to
Stenay. I watched near the furnace.
Toward two o'clock, at a moment
when the moon was hidden, Manchin,
who is a woodcutter of Ire, passed be
fore our lodge. 'See me! Am I not
watching at an early hour?' I cried.
'How goes all at your home? All
well?'
" 'No,' he answered. 'The mother
has a fever and the children are al
most dying with hunger. There is
not a mouthful of bread in the house.
and I am trying to kill a rabbit to sell
in Maryville.' That is on the other
side of Onze-Fontaine. I lost sight
of him then, but at daybreak I heard
the report of a gun, and 1 was just
clearing the ashes to shield the char
coal. Then, immediately after. two
men came running toward our lodge.
They were disputing. 'Scoundrell'
cried the guard. 'I arrest you.'
" 'Sourrot:' cried the other. 'I pray
you let nce have the rabbit, for they
are dying of hunger at my home.'
"' 'Go to the devil!' said the guard.
Then they fell upon each other. I
could hear their hard blows plainly.
Suddenly the guard cried: 'Oh!' and
then he fell heavily.
"I had hidden behind our lodge, ter
ribly frightened, and Manchin ran
away into the great forest, and from
that time to this he has not been seen.
lie is in Belgium, for sure. That is
all."
"Hum!'' growled the judge. "WVhy
did you not come to tell this as soon as
you received the summons?"
"It was none of Iny business-and I
did not wish to speak against Man
chin."
"I see; but you seem to have changed
your mind this morning. How is
that?"
"It is because I have heard that they
accused Guestin."
"And who is this Guestin?"
The girl reddened and answered:
"He is our neighbor charcoal burner,
and he would not harm a fly. I)o you
not see," she continued, "that the
thought of fastening on him the guilt
of another aroused me? I put these
great boots on, and I have run all the
way through the woods to tell yoe
this. Oh, how I have run! I did not
feel tired. I would have run till to
morrow if it had been necessary. be
cause it is as true as the blue Heavens
that our Guestin is entirely innocent
gentlemen."
"'Hlallo!" cried he, seeing her sudden
ly grow pale and stagger. "Whatse
the matter?"
"'My head swims. I cannot see."
She changed color, and her temples
grew moist.
The judge, alarmed, poured out a
glass of wine and said: "Drink this
quickly!" He was wholly absorbed and
very much moved before this girl who
was threatened with illness. lie dared
not call Scholastique, for fear of dis
turbing his cooking. He looked help
lessly toward the clerk,who was gnaw
ing his penholder.
"It is a swoon." observed the lat
ter. "Perhaps she needs something
to eat."
"Are you hungry?" demanded the
judge.
She made a sign of assent.
"Excuse me," she said in a feeble
voice, "but I have had nothing to eat
since yesterday. It is that which
makes me dizzy."
"The deuce!" he cried at last hero
ically. Violently he drew toward him
the platter on which lay the trout.
After separating a large piece, which
he put on the table before her, he made
the charcoal burner sit down.
"Eat!" said he, imperiously.
He had no need to repeat his com
mand. She ate rapidly, voraciously.
In another minute the plate was empty,
and Judge Sourdat heroically filled it
anew.
The scribe Touchbouef rubbed h.is
eyes. He no longer recognized the
judge. He admired, though not
without a sentiment of regret, the
robust appetite of the charcoal burner,
who devoured the exquisite fish with
out any more ceremony than if it had
been a smoked herring, and he mur
mured: "VWhat a pity! Such abeautiful
dish!"
At that moment the door opened,
The third guest, the good priest of St.
Vincent, in a new cassock and with
his three-cornered hat under his arm,
entered the dining-room and stopped
questioningly before the strange
smectacle of that little savage seated
at the judge's table.
"Too late, MI. le Cure!" growled the
judge. "There'a no more trout2"
At the same time he related the
history of the little charcoal burner.
The cure heaved a sigh. He compre
hended the grandeur of the sacrice,
but half mournful, half smiling, lie
tapped upon the shoulder of thile judge.
"Judge lIemorin Sourdatl" eried hI,
"you are better tihan you thonfught. i
truth I tell you that all punishment
for your sin of gluttony will he for
ever remitted because of that trout
which we havoe not saten,"--Romrance.
A PUNCTUAL SCHEME.
rr,. Plldar Puts Up a Job on HIs Wife
Which Reacts on Himelf.
Mr. Pildur is passionately fond of
cycling, but his wife, who also rides,
believes that the best methodx of loco
motion is to follow her husband. Mr.
Pildur, who likes to take a spin in com
pany with his friends can scarcely con
ceal his delight when his wife remains
at home.
MIr. and Mrs. Pildur are seated at the
breakfast table and have nearly fin
ished. A window is wide open and the
sun shines into the room.
Mr. Pildur (laying down his napkin
and rising from the table)-lt is going
to be a fine day.
Mrs. Pildur (insinuatingly)-Hoow
pleasant it would be to pedal in the
shade of the large trees of the park.
1Ir. Pildur (slightly troubled, in an
astonished tone)-You ride a cycle this
morning?
Mrs. Pildur-"Yes, certainly, my
dear. If I do not go when the weather
is fine, when will I go?
AMr. Pildur (manifestly put out)-I
think
Mrs. Pildur-WVhat, my dear?
MLr. Pildur (ironically)-Don't you
expect your mother this morning, my
excellent mother-in-law?
Mrs. Pildur (touched)-This after
noon; you know very well. Anddonot
make fun of lnanmma.
Mr. Pildur (starting away grumbling)
-Well, do not stop, put on your clothes
and do not be long; I will go and look
at the machines.
Mrs. Pildur (coaxingly)-What hat
shall I wear, my white or blue one?
Mr. Pildur (indifferently)-WVhich
ever you wish, it's all the same to me.
Mirs. Pildur (going away)-Really.
you are not very good-natured this
morning.
MIr. Pildur (once alone talks to him
self)-What luck! Sly little spin with
the Rapid club spoiled! It was a great
mistake when I taught my wife to ride
the bicycle. My wife is handsome on
the cycle. MNy friends have told me so.
I have four pneumatics to look after.
two machines to verify, two machines
to oil, surely I was insane when I
bought her splendid bicycle. I have
no liberty. I could weep. The memn
lers of the club say I am not one of
them. (Suddenly MIr. Pildur strikes
his forehead). Zounds I know what I
will do, a neat little trick; I will go
with the club. (lie goes out quickly
and returns in a few moments).
3Mr. Pildur (calling)-Marie! 3Marie!
MIrs. Pildur (running surprised)
What is it my dear?
Mir. Pildur (aside)-It is a mean trick.
(Loudly)-Poor dear! how vexatious;
your pneumatic is deflated! What a
deuce of an invention are these pneu
nlaties; you think you are ready to
,.tart when crack. there's a puncture.
Mirs. Pildur (bursting into sobs)-Oh!
Oh!
MIr. Pildur (aside much moved by tihe
despair of Marie)-Her tears make me
regret the pneumaticide. (Loudly)
The pneumatic is a horrible invention!
Mr. and 'Mrs. Pildur go out to look at
the machines and examine the pneu
inatic.
3r-s. Pildur (while weeping examines
the pneumatic of her machine. presses
it and finds it hard and fully inflated)
-What did you say, you wicked man?
It is all right. Look at it.
TMr. Pildur (uneasy)-What? (IHe looks
at the wheels of his own machine.)
Thunder, I am wrong! It is nmy own
pneumatic that I have punctured!~-Le

THE YACHT RACE.
It Was Postponed and Postponed, But It
Finally Came Off.
lie went to see the yacht race when
his life was young and fair, the bloom
was on his morning brow, the gloss
was on his hair; but when he came to
where the yachts were anchored in the
bay, they said the race had been post
poned andi couldn't come off that day.
The next day a wild storm arose, the
winds blew wild and free; the nextday
not a ripple moved upon the dreaming
sea: the next day was a day of fogs,
and still the people say: "The race has
been postponed again and can't come
off to-day."
uint still lie waited, like a tree that's
firmly taken root, his hair was streaked
with early gray, his whiskers grew a
foot; and while the moss grew on his
back he heard the people say: "The
race has been postponed again and
can't come off to-day."
With one lone eye he watched the sea
and never looked behind, with one lone
eye lihe gazed and gazed the other eye
was blind; and after many years grown
deaf he could not hear them say: "The
race has been postponed again and
can't come off to-day."
The whiskers grew down to his feet,
thie grass greyv in his ears, and he died
looking out to sea-he'dwaited seventy
years-and reverently his aged form
within the grave they lay-the race
came off, a great event, upon his fu
neral day.-N. Y. World.
Why Slang Is Popular.
"Charley," said young Mtrs. Torkins,
"what does the phrase 'talking
through your hat' mean?"
"It means," was the reply, "that the
person in connection with whom it is
used is in the habit of speaking with
out bestowing a due amount of thought
upon the topic on which he has under
taken to discourse, or that he has se
lected one which even with a reason

be utterly incapable of comprehend

she murmured:

in moderation, is so very bad after all,

CENTS ARE LEGAL TENDER.
Ia Amounts of Twenty-five or Under They
WVII Go Anywhere In This Country.
There is one story so utterly ridicu
lous that it seems incredible that it
should ever have been printed, which
in one form or another makes the
rounds of various newspapers of the
country annually. Look for it and you
will sooner or later see it crop up again.
This tale is always based upon the un
popularity of the one-cent pieces in the
extreme west and southwest. In its
most common form it tells of some east
ern traveler who attempts to dispose of
a hundred or so one-cent pieces in San
Francisco, El Paso or some other place.
The tradesman is always represented
as looking at them curiously and de
clining them.
The writers of these senseless tales
may have been in the west or they may
not. It matters little-their story is
pointless. They seek to brand the
mythical tradesman as of the same cat
egory with themselves.
The cent is a legal-tender in amounts
of twenty-five and less. If an eastern
man in San Francisco or anywhere else
owes a debt of twenty-five cents, and
tenders twenty-five orw-cent pieces in
settlement, the courts will sustain him.
Of course, the coins are not popular
in the extreme west and south, but no
one need carry a hundred of them in a
cigar box or anywhere else as useless
metal. If you are in a city that has a
United States sub-treasury, go to the
post office, dump in twenty-five cents
and see if you will have any difficulty
in obtaining stamps or postal cards of
like amount. If one is refused, a let
ter of complaint to the postal authori
ties will soon work the removal of an
employe who would discredit United
States money.
It is well to bear this nmatter of the
legal tender of a cent in mind. No
one for spite can make a person take
more than twenty-five of them in any
single traneiction involving the settle
ment of a debt. One need have no
fear, then, of receiving one hundred
dollars in cents from some embittered
debtor.-N. Y. Herald.
A RARE CASE.
The Heroic Deed of a Bad lan in the
Southwest.
It isn't often that one finds among
the mnountaimiders of the southwest a
hero of the highest type, but they do
exist, and a year or so ago I met one.
I had beeen in his neighborhood for
three months, and I knew that he
had killed a man or two and had the
reputation of being the gamest man in
the mountains. He was extremely
handy with a gun, too, and everybody
gave him a wide berth whenever there
was a prospect of a row. One day,
however, he got into a difficulty with
a man from an adjoining county, and
when the shooting began he cut and
run like a white-head, leaving the
field in possession of the other party.
Two days afterwards I met him on the
road and we talked about the late dis
turbance.
"'I was rather surprised at the way
you acted," I said as mildly as I could,
for even then I had no wish to stir him
imp.
"I reckon most folks wus," he re
plied briefly.
"I know they were, and they don't
understarnd it. Neither do I."
"Well," hlie said, half apologetically,
"I reckon I jist run, and that vwuz all
thar wuz to hit."
"There was more than that: you lost
your reputation by it."
"3Mebbe I did, colonel," and he swal
lowed a lump in his throat: "'but that
thar feller had seven little children do
pendin' on him, an' I kinder had a idea
jist afore I pulled trigger that mebbe I
could git along better without my rep
pertation than they could without ther
daddy, so I run."
He stopped as if uncertain what to
say next, and I took him by the hand
and shook it with a vigor that I knew
he appreciated by the look that camne
into his eyes.--Detroit Free Press.

FARM AND GARDEN.
SHEEP FARMING PAYS.
If Properly Managed It Is Sure to Rletur
a Fair Froft.
Sheep farming requires the least
labor of any kind of farming, and is
one of the most profitable if properly
managed. It is the least laborious be
cause sheep are more easily kept than
other animals. They will eat food
that no other kind of stock will touch,
and they require less personal atten
tion, besides being more hardy and
less liable to disease.
They are the most profitable because,
in addition to the foregoing, they are
the sources of two valuable products,
while with other stock but one is
looked for. Even though wool is low,
the fleece will bring enough to pay for
the keep of the animal, and the mut
ton will be the profit.
Formerly sheep owners bred simply
for wool, and as the highest develop
ment in the wool-bearing capacity is
incompatible with the perfection of
mutton-producing ability, the latter
suffered to such an extent that the
flesh of the animal was practically un
salable. hMutton-eating was steadily
discouraged, and the genuine lovers
of this meat had recourse to Canada,
where mutton sheep were reared.
That this belief in the inferiority of
the American product still exists is
shown by the fact that "Canada mut
ton" signs are still exhibited in the
butchers' shops and wagons in New
York.
But with the discovery that the pro
auction of both flesh and fleece in a
high degree is compatible in the same
animal, the demand for mutton has
grown. At sight of this delicious,
juicy meat prejudice has faded and is
fading away. It has become a formid
able rival to beef, and its consumption
may readily be increased a hundred
per cent.
And yet many men are talking as if
the business were ruined and are get
ting out of it as fast as they can, ig
norant of the fact that it is the best
farm property they have to-day. These
are the men who forget that condi
tions have been reversed since they
went into the business. AMutton is
now the staple and wool the by-prod
uct. If the wool pays expenses, that
is all that should now be asked of it.

ABOUT ESSEX SWINE.
Some slerits and Defects of One of the
(ildest itreeds.
This is one of the oldest English
breeds of swine. Its merits have ob
tained for it a well-deserved popular
ity in this country. as well as in it9
native land. The modern Essex breed
is the result of a cross of the original
stock on the Neapolitan. It belongs
to one of the so-called small breeds.
Essex swine are black, or, rather,
ash-black in color; they have a short
dished face, broad between the eyes;
erect, thin ears, full jowls,' short,
thick neck, body of medium length,
broad, deep and straight, with heavy

When matured, the improved Essex
will weigh from three to four hundred
pounds. T'hey mature early, are pro
litic and possess great rigor of consti
tution. They fatten easily, range
well and, not being troubled with
mange or sun-scald, are a peculiarly
valuable breed for the south. The
Essex are excellent as a. cross, being
sure to give quality and early maturity
to any breed. When crossed upon
commlon or coarser swine they will im
prove them almost beyond recognition.
The objection urged against them is
their tendency to fatten rapidly, which
causes the carcasses to lack the de
sired proportion of lean meat. This

objection can be largely overcome by
limiting the amount of food and com
pelling exercise. Being good grazers,
they should be allowed unrestricted
run of pasturage and no corn or other
fattening food until it is desired to
finish them off. On the other hand,
their tendency to fatten is a great
recommendation where roasting pigs
are desired. The meat can be made fit
for pork at any age, from a month up
ward. In England these hogs are
marketed in great numbers when from
five to eight months old, for light fam
ily pork, and for that purpose there
are none better.-N. Y. World.

Lambs, colts and calves should be
kept continuously growing, whether
they are to be kept over winter or sold
in the fall. When they go into winter
quarters the observer should be able
to note their sleek, fine, healthy, ro
bust condition. Such growth can only
be obtained by judicious management
and attention. Good pasture, pure
water, perhaps a little grain during
the droughty season and frequent salt
uing are needed.
Potato Erports and Imports.
In the year ending June 1, 1898, we
imported potatoes to the value of Sa,
066,589. The heaviest importations
were at New York, 81.497,328; Boston,
8304,657, and Philadelphia, $116,679. In
the same period we ex.orted 8700,032
worth of potatoes The bulk of this
trade was with the countries south of
us. Cuba, 8554,1583; Mexico, 827.504;

1 have made a brake like the one il
lustrated, and it is such a good thing
that I think it my duty to show it to
others. The iron pieces can be made
by any blacksmith. The wooden
lever (2) should be made of some
tough wood, about three inches at the
thickest part, shaped down as shown,
to one and one-fourth inches thick.
The ratchet can be put on by means
of bolts, one at Z and one at Y. which
holds the rack pieces together. The
chain should be ten or fifteen inches
long, with an open link to shorten
with if necessary. If you have not a
chain suitable, you can use a piece of
wood by boring several holes so as to
bring it to the right place. The hole

about ten or twelve inches from the
end (E). Use a half-inch bolt to put

it on with. Put a one-half-inch hard
wood washer behind the lever and one
in front of it. Put the chain on the
wooden lever as marked; put on the
iron lever (1), fasten the other end of
the chain on it, and raise it up until
the check blocks are just off the
wheels, then hook up your chain by
the open link until it is tight. Screw
the little piece of iron (S) on the
wooden lever with three-fourth-inch
screws; bolts would be better. The
iron lever goes on the rod across the
hounds, as usual, except it is put up
side down, and underneath the axle.
When going with empty rack, the
wooden lever can be taken off and
bolted on to the wagon standard, as
shown by dotted lines.
It can also be used for wagon with
bed off or on, as with empty rack.-VW.

FRUIT IN TRANSIT.
Modern LMethods lave Eliminated All
]Danger from Freezing.
A bulletin which has just been sent
out by Prof. Mark IV. Harrington,
chief of the weather bureau, gives the
opinions gathered from many ship
pers of perishable products throughout
the country in relation to the proper
protection of fruits and vegetables
from heat and cold during transporta
tion. These men generally concur in the
statement that the danger in transpor
tation from freezing has been elim
inated by modern methods. The so
called lined car, which has a partition
of tongued and grooved boards at the
sides and ends, placed so as to leave
an air space of about four inches,
answers for spring and autumn and
during most winter weather, while
the Eastman heating car in extreme
weather has proved a perfect protec
tion. Perishable goods can be shipped
with safety in ordinary freight cars
when the outside temperature Is twen
ty degrees Fahrenheit, and in re
frigerator cars when it is ten iegrees.
Fruit wrapped in heavy brovwn paper
will endure fifteen degrees mere cold
than if it is not so wrapped. Damp
ness is very injurious, and products
which are shipped in a dry condition
can endure a much lower degree of
temperature without injury than un
der moist conditions. It should al ways
be remembered that the kind of pack
ing which keeps out the cold will keep
in the heat, so that there is often more
danger from heating by process of de -
composition thian from injury by the
cold. When a north wind is blowing
on the prairie, cars which contahi
fruit are often covered with canvas ts
the north side. Oranges that have
been frozen may be thawed without
injury by putting them in cold water
or in tight barrels immediately after
arriving, allowing them to thaw out
gradually. These are some of lthe
points picked almost at random from
what is altogether a most instructive
circular.
FACTS FOR FARMERS.
EACH field is adapted to some special
crop. Study the soil and the needs of
the crop.
SWEET potatoes contain a large pro
portion of sugar, and are more fatten*
ing than corn. The smallest sizes are
equal to the best for stock.
Tun fruit market as notorverstocked
with choice fruit this year, and.good
prices were obtained despite the dull
times and low wages.
IF not already done it is now time to
cut out all the old stalks among the
raspberries and blackberries. Ieave
out three or four of the strongest of
the new canes and treat the rest as
weeds.
THE seed corn for next year cOnnot
be too dry. Let the select earsremain
on the stalks until the leaves turn
yellow and the hernels are hard and
dry; then hang the ears up in a dry
place.

used for breeding purposes year after

is a liability of loss of stamina. The
best specimens are procured from ma
