THE GROUND HOG.
AS FORECASTED IT TURNED UP
ON MARCH 14.
itWa. Pc' hi- and! Pitched About Con
eide'ral iv -l hie \\ctat her \\Ws
Nt- to Its Notiont.
It isn't cveryb (v who can or would
keep up with the ground hog. wlho.e
mil vemenints and s pec titaons are beyoid
the reasonable computation of an ordi
nary man. This is one animal that can
-et away completely with a man. It is
conceded that a man may get a coon any
where on a night's hunt. and he can
shoot a deer or a hear or a tiger, but he
must be "a slick one to tree a ground
hog. although there are some women
who could do it if they ventured on such
a trial. As before declared a ground hog
is much smaller than an elephant and
not as ferocious in appearance as a rhi
nocerous, but what it lacks in size and
respectable gentility it can make up on
his past weather record. To some people
the ground hog is everything: to others
it isn't worth a continental, simply be
cause, as other things and signs, it isn't
reliable. Any Jay knows that all signs
fail during a drouth or a long rainy
spell. Insofar as we are concerned, we
wouldn't wager a copper cent on the
ground hog, any more than we would
risk a plant of 'taters or corn in the
moon, as in our humble opinion and in
view of our 'past experience "all sich"
should go into the ground. But there are
two great ground hog days in every
year. The first is on the 2nd of Febru
ary and the second i, forty days there
after. In our last issues of Sunday and
the Weekly we dwelt on the first appear
ance of the ground hog. The weather
was not to its notion and it crawled
back and pulled in the hole. We made
it plain why the rain has followed the
crawling in of the ground hog on Feb
ruary 2, but on March 14 was the tide,
fixed to let up, for a clearing of the
weather. We watched the hog from day
light but the darn thing didn't show up
until 1I :55 p.m. It surged about, yanked
around, monkeyed a little with a bit of
straw nearby, switched its tail, blinked
its eyes from which came teardrops as
big as your fist. It was disappointed. It
was feeling sorry. It was embarrassed.
It was like a politician who has been
feeding at the public crib all his life and I
was fearufl of losing his job. It was
pesky, pitched and floundere# about
considerably, but it stuck out, although
it"crawled back several times into its
hole and crawled out again. According
to the rule, it's up to the ground hog,
and if the weather be not serene and
lovely, why, put it on the hog or on any
thing, but our private dpinion publicly a
expressed is that in time there will come t
a change regardless of the hog. Now
that the hog is out, it is root or die, and
the hog will root.

WEATHER BULLETIN.
The Cold, the Warm and the Storm
Waves Forecasted.
(Copyrighted 1903 by W. T. Foster.)
St. Joseph, Moa, March 14.-My last
bulletin gave forecasts of disturbance
to cross the continent March so to 14,
warm wave g. to 13, cool wave i2 to i6.
Next disturbance will reach Pacific
coast about March 15, cross west of the
Rockies by dose of 16, great central
valleys 17 to ig, eastern states 20.
Warm wave will-cross west of the
Rockies about March I, great central
valleys 17, eastern states ig. Cool wave
will cross west of Rockies about March
i8, great central valleys 20, eastern
states 22.
This will be an important disturb
ance, as it will close with a severe cold
wave that will reach meridian go about
2o, moving eastward about doo miles a
day.
Indications are that this cold wave
will not reach so far south as did that
of February 18. Its center seems to be
marked for a route extending from
Manitoba into the Ohio valley and then
eastward. The storm wave will move
so rapidly that warm wave, cold wave
and rains will be of short duration.
Remainder of the month is expected
to average colder than usual with rain
fall above th& average.
Another disturbance will reach the
Pacific coast about 20, cross west of the
Rockies by close of 21, great central
valleys 22 to 24, eastern states 25.
Warm wave will cross west of the
Rockies aobut 2o, great central valleys
22, eastern states 24. Cool wave will
cross of the Rockies about 23, great
central valleys 25, eastern states 27.
