GOVERNOR HOKE SMITH’S
PLAN.
It is said that Governor Hoke
Smith, of Georgia, has a plan to solve
the race problem.
The plan is “to remove the negro
from the South and scatter them
over the North.”
It is unfortunate that a man of
sense sthoiuld lapse into such pitiful
stupidity.
In the first place: How are you
going to carry the negro to the North
and scatter them?
With the 14th amendment remain
ing in force, you can not do it by
law, and there is little likelihood of
the negroes consenting voluntarily to
it.
In the second place, the negroes
are not going to scatter.
They are the most gregarious of all
the races.
Put a. thousand negroes in the city
of Chicago (I mean genuine negroes),
and it will not be ten years before
they will all be living in the same
neighborhood, where they can have
their lodge meetings, church seances,
discuss matters, form their machina
tions —all away from tire possibility
of the white man’s interference.
In the third place: The w’hite peo
ple of the North do not want the
negro.
They like the negro as a race very
well.
But they despise him,—rt hey hate
him as an individual.
He may be useful to the poli
ticians who want to buy his vote.
But he is very undesirable to the
white laboring man.
The fact is, the negro does not make
a good citizen anywhere.
He is unfit for citizenship and
ought not to be permit ted to enjoy
all the privileges of citizenship.
The only way to solve the race
problem, is to repeal the 15th amend
ment to the Federal Constitution and
modify the 14th, and leave to the
States a free hand to deal with the
question.
Then if the laws enacted by any
State do not suit the negro, he will
be permitted to go and live where the
laws are more favorable to him.
Governor Smith has too much sense
to indulge in such absurd vaporing's.
—The Issue.
JUSTICE, NOT CHARITY.
The growth of charity marks the
decline of the Republic. It is an un
mistakable evidence of national de
cay. It indicates a constantly in
creasing number who are deprived of
opportunity.
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
Unless it is confined to its proper
sphere, charity is degrading and de
moralizing. Real charity is one of
the cardinal virtues; but unless it
helps one to help himself, it becomes
a gift, a donation, a contribution or
a species of graft.
Even Carnegie himself says: “If
you want to do harm with your money
give it to people who will not strug
gle for themselves.”
How many people, even of those
who do 4 ‘struggle for themselves,”
can resist the killing influence of
charity? How many people are there
whose lives have been a blank because
they waited for dead men’s shoes?
It is the paramount duty of the
government to see that every man
has an opportunity, by the application
of brain or brawn, to win a home,
educate his children, satisfy his rea
sonable desires and ambitions, and
provide against adversity in old age.
Whenever conditions are such that
any considerable number of our peo
ple are not able to do this, there is
‘‘something rotten” in the body
politic. It no longer deserves to be
called a popular government. Equal
justice to all and special privileges
to none is the true test. —The Senti
nel, Woodsfield, Ohio.
EARNEST WILLIE’S ERROR.
Filled with rash optimism of the
groom elect, Earnest Willie Upshaw,
just before his wedding this week,
sent a challenge to Tom Watson to
debate with him on the question of
foreign missions, the latter having
been busily engaged in deprecating
the contributions that Americans
made for the conversion of the
heathen. Now be it known that de
bating with said Tom is, for the other
debater, just about as pleasant as the
gentle pastime of spanking a hedge
hog. Therefore we hope for the sake
of the new Mrs. Willie, a. splendid
woman whom we know and admire,
that Tom will refuse to grab up the
gauntlet.
This is no time for Willie to be
running around and hunting up de
bates outside the family anyhow. He
will have enough debates right at
home to keep him busy for the next
few weeks. If Willie had waited a
short time he would never have
sent out the defy. A newly mar
ried man has about all the educa
tion he can assimilate waiting for
him. He will learn more in the
first year than he ever knew in his
whole life before. Foreign missions
is no topic for him to fret over. Home
missions, with the accent on the
home, is his legitimate sphere.
We trust Tom, being a married
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, May 20, 1909
man himself, and understanding all
these things, will pretend that he
never received the challenge, and let
Earnest Willie alone. —Rome Tribune-

PRGTECTiv XT E THING;
WAGES
That digging, delving, inu.%* ent
little sheet, the Wise County .News,
has dug up from the Congressional
Record a recent speech by Senator
Nelson, Republican, of Minnesota, on
the subject of the tariff. Senator
Nelson seems to be just about as free
and independent as the Wise County
News, and in his speech 4 ‘handed a
few” to his Republican colleagues
who stand for high protection. He
said in part:
“I speak as a Republican. I need
hot come here like the Senator from
lowa a,nd the Senator from Rhoda
Island and speak of my political line
age or anything of that kind. I do
not know much about it. Very likely
my ancestors were Norwegian pirates.
44 1 wish, however, to say to the Sen
ator from Rhode Island that I have
fought as many hard battles for the
Republican party in the State of Min
nesota as he has ever fought in Rhode
Island or in any part of New Eng
land; and I think that a man, no mat
ter where he may live, who stands for
a. higher rate of duty than is justified
by the flair and just principles of pro
tection is a greater enemy to the Re
publican party than any enemy you
©an possibly find on the other side of
the chamber. That is the reason that
I asked that this schedule be passed
over.
44 It is curious, Mr. President, to see
how the high protected manufacturers
always crawl behind the laboring man.
They forget that it is the law of sup
ply and demand that governs the mat
ter of labor. The laboring man is not
protected. This country can be flood
ed with emigrants from the Old World
•nd the labor market overcrowded.
The laboring man has no protection.
His wages are based upon the law of

•apply Mjrd demand. Have you not
evidence of that fact in the panic of
1907 ? Before that panic occurred
wages were perhaps higher than they
had ever been in this country in re
cent years. During the past year there
has been a general reduction in wages.
All this occurred under the same tariff
law—the Dingley law—which was in
force in 1907, the same as in 1908.
Why the reduction in wages?”
“The high protected manufacturers
always crawl behind the laboring
man.” And when the House Ways
and Means Committee had under con
sideration the tariff subject, the trusts
crawled behind the independents, as
witness the procedure of the Ameri
can Steel Corporation, which effaced
its form and put forward the
44 independents” in its line to plead
for protection of the steel industry.
Senator Nelson’s exposure of the
fallacy of the doctrine that protection
maintains high wages is unanswer
able. Wages are based upon the law
of supply and demand. Under the
same Dingley bill high and low wages
have alternated. The laboring man
is not protected. Immigration laws
now in force permit the flooding of
this country with Old World cheap
labor whenever it should be to the ad
vantage of the employers of. labor to
encourage such immigration. High
protection and high wages may or
may not go hand in hand. Whether
the two things consort or not is an
incident and not a cosequence.—Rich
