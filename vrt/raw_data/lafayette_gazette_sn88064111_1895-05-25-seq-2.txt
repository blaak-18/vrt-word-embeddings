`ggregated wealth they will either

dissenting opinions of four of the
3.udges make very interesting read

,n- only consolation that we, of
~ouisiana, may get out of the dc

Pope Leo XIII is impressed with

N. 0. States.
The States is pleased to hear that
a mnovement is on foot to have Gen.
Leon Jastremski, now United States
Consul at Calloa appointed Consul
General at Havana to succeed Mr.
Ramon Williams recently recalled
as persona non grata by the govern
ament at the request of the Spanish
iAuthorities. It is understood that
the entire Louisiana delegation will
press the appointment of Gen. Jas
tremski, and it is to be hoped that
their efforts will be successful be
-cause he is eminently qualified to
-ill the position with honor and
eredit to the government. His
services as cousul as Caloa have
been highly satisfactory and on sev
eral occasions the State Department
h- as complimented his reports for
the valuable information they con
tained.-N. O0 States.
There is not in the whole land a
-ttuer American and one who will
represent his country abroad with
n more credit than General Jas
L-emski. The Louisiana delega
-ion could do no better than to urge
1:r's claims to -promotion. He is a
:a staunch Democrat, a orainy man
and a thorough gentleman.
In spite of all the talk about the
millennium it would seem that the
day of fanatical bigotry and reli
g ious intolerance has not yet passed
aRay. At the Southern Baptist
dnhceition held in Washington this
w eeka Rev. Dr. Cranfill of Texas
-indlged in a bitter tirade against
:the Catholic Church and wasted a
;, graSt deal of sympathy on the poor
j-¶hnprssoned nuns." It is no won

ch success in their impious cru
Ssde when they have only to point
tosuch instances as this to show
pwthese Christians love." In
ato the great Baptist Church,

" * * * "we declare that, we
have no feeling of unkindness to-!
ward the colored man; on the con
trary," we will sustain and protect
him in the full enjoyment of all his
civil and political rights."
The reader will naturally expect
to be told that the above resolution
was adopted by a Republican con
vention and is intended as a bid
for the negro vote, but what will he
think when he is told that it was
adopted at a meeting of Democrats
held in New Orleans last Saturday
night?. Since when have Louisiana
Democrats gone into -the business
of *"sustaibing and protecting the
negro in the full enjoyment oft his
civil andpotiical rights?" Do the
negroes need protection? The Ga
zette believes that they are getting
along well and are enjoying all the
civil and political rights to which
they are entitled. These gentlemen
did not make it known how they
propose to protect the negro in his
poliical rights. We always thought
that the -Republican party had -a
monopoly of the business of pro
tecting the colored brother, and
was fully able to do so unaided, but
it appears from the above resolution
that a number of Louisiana Demo
crats will extend all the help neces
sary and will do so unsolicited. A
faction of the Democratic party
taking up the cudgel for the negro
is indeed a new departure in Louis
iana politics. If this opposition to
the present State administration can
not find any other issue, they had
better make a fight squarely for the
offices. The long-winded resolu
tions about the welfare of the
Democratic party is the veriest non
sense and their ballot reform pre
tenses will deceive no one. The
people of Louisiana have had
enough of such politics and are not
in a moo'! to be bamboozled with
imaginary ills which exist only, in
the fertile brains of dissatisfied poli
ticians.
A number of letters from promi
nent Democrats in the country were
read endorsing the move. We
have no doubt that they did so not
knowing that the colored brother
would' be extended protection in
his political rights, chief among
which is that of suffrage. Now
that this part of the program is
known it is expected that with
Kdrawals will follow.
Job work neatly and promptly
done at this office.
There is not an honest man in.
the State who does not favor fair
elections, but a great many of those
who pose as reformers are actuated
more by selfish interest than patriot
ism in their utterances about ballot
reform. Some of these so-called
reformers are accomplished ballot
box stuffers out of a job and are
anxious to again get ther noses into
the public crib.-Miansfield Demo

Swiftly and surely we are coming
to the pass that all the avenues
through which men can earn a liv
ing and keep body and soul together
here upon earth are to be control
ed by capital. - Herein lies the secret
of the struggle going on all over the
world-a struggle on the part of
labor against the absolute control
by capital of all the opportunities
ot earning a livelyhood. What is
labor contending for? For better
food, better clothing and better
shelter? No! The fight is not pri
marily for these things. The la
borer of to-day is better housed,
better fed, better clothed on the
average than ever before, and it is
where he is best fed and and best
clothed that this struggle is the
fiercest The fight is not one for
higher wages or shorter hours or
better material conditions, but it is
for libe~ry,, intidustr.al /iberty-eman
cipation fromnt the absolute domin
ion of aggregated capital. The ne
groes of the South were, we dare
say, better fed, better clothed and
better housed on an average in the
days of slavery than they are today.
But their craving for themselves
and children was deeper and di
viner than the desire for these
things; it was a craving for free
dom. It is so of the *rage-earners
of to-day. The despotism of kings
is no more to be feared than the
despotism of capital. What, then,
is the best way to avert this impend
ing despotism? T;.e first thing to
be done is to secure a popular un
derstanding of the nature of the
conflict and of the rear issues in
volved. Tbe rights of opportunity
-ujt be made as spcred as the
rights of property. We cannot ar
-rest the progress. of science and 'iii
vention, and begin a backward
march toward -barbarism. 'But we
can recognise the fact that the pro
gress which has been and the pro
gress which still must be, bring us
face to face with a new peril to lib
erty.-New York Voice.
Man's Opinion of Womnan.
Patterson Optic.
The following article was handed in by
one of Patterson's gifted scribes, and was
published some years ago. It is worthy of
the space given it, and time is not wasted by
having read it:
I am neither a missogg ust, misogamist,
nor even a monogamist, I am a particular
admirer of the female sex. I look upon wo
man as thesalt of the earth, the light of the
world, the glory of the home circle and the
corner stone of the social struc
ture, and I have attested my high apprecia
tion of the sex by marrying as early and as
often as I have had the opportunity, and
the dear creatures have-with some few ex
ceptions-reciprocated by marrying me as
often as I have given them the opportunity.
But I amno admirer of that class called
strongminded women. Whenever I see- or
hear of a woman traveling round the coun
try lecturing to public tssemblies upon their
duties and responsibilities, I feel sure that
tat woman's stockings need darning, her
children's faces need washing, and that her
husband ties his suspenders with a string.
Many of them are brilliant, but they are
like the meteors that flash across the sky,
they attract attention in their eratic course
and dazzle the eye with the brilliant trail of
light they leave behind them, but they serve
no useful purpose.
As the stars that vmove quietly in their ap
pointed spheres preserve the balance of the
universe and prevent "the wreck of matter
and the crush of worlds," so the wife and
mother, adorning the home circle, is the
great conservator of religion, morality,
truth and purity, and is the great factor in
the enlightment and civilization of the
world.
We admire some women for their beauty,
others for their virtue, and others for their
intellectual endowments-but there are two
women to whom all men render the tributi
of reverential love and esteem: One of
these is the mother, upon whose sympathetic
bosom we wept away all our infantile woes;
at whose knee we learned to lisp our pray
ers, and across whose motherly lap we were
sometimes drawn while she emphasized her
teachings with a slipper.
The other is our wife, who' is performing
the same kind offices for our little ones our
mother did for us; who att-'nds to our com
forts, keeps our buttons in order, and keeps
us in the straight and narrow way "by coun
seis sweet and lengthened sage advice."
These women are not found crowding
round the polls on election day, nor riding
straddle through the streets; nor lecturing
from the platform. But they are to be
found looking around the garden to see
what prospects there are for vegetables for
dinner, or in the henhouse quarreling with
some hen that wants to set at an inoppor
tune time, or in the house, scolding the ser
vants, spanking the children, or chasing the
cat out of the dining-room with the broom:
They are not always beautiful or accom
plished, or intellectual, but they have a
fixed faith, and instinctive sense of right,
and great, tender, loving hearts. They are
the women who make their mark on the age
in which they live, and whose influence is
felt for generations after they are gone.
The influence of a mother's teachings and
the memory of a mother's love and devotion
plead more strongly with a man in the hour
of temptation than all the 'she' lecturers
that ever stood on a platform.

THE NEGRO VOTERS IN
ST. LANDRY.
The Gazette is pleased to see
I that the white people of St. Landry
parish are getting tired of the negro
as a voter. If the following edi
torial from the Opelousas Call ex
presses the sentiments of a majority
of the white people of that parish,
and we believe that it does, the ne
gro will hereafter take a back seat
in things political of the empire
parish. The white man who wants
to keep the negro in politics is un
true to his blood, is a traitor to his
race and enemy to the negro, and
the white candidate who wants the
negro to vote because he cannot be
elected by white votes is, as a rule,
unfit to hold office, and should not
be trusted with any position of
honor. The Call says:
That conservative but "true blue"
white supremacy journal, the Lafa
yette Gazette, makes the following
comment:
"Our contemporary, the Opelousas Call,
is making it rather inpleasant for impudent
negroes in Opelousas. Editor Dreaux, as
long as your politicians will hobnob with
the negro for his vote, the latter will be im
pudent. The negro has no business in poll
:'ics."
You voice the sentiments of the
white people of this parish, Bro.
Mouton. Unfortunately the col
ored voters hold the balance of
power in this parish, as is clearly
shown by the election of negro Na
poleon McBride to the legislature,
and a visit to the justices' courts
will further substantiate the fact.
But the day is near at hand when
the white, man will rule this parish
independent of the corrupt and pur
chaseable negro element. The
white people are tired of seeing a
corrupt element herded together
and driven to the ballot box to per
form the functions intended for free
and intelligent Amerian citizens.
The rights won in seas of blood by
our forefathers is not to be trailed
in the mire and trampled upon by
a class of people who are tweedled
into line by the jingle of a silver
dollar or the sight of a whiskey bar
rel. You have gotten rid of them,
Bro. Mouton and believe us, the
writiing on the wall is that St. Lan
dry is about to free herself from the
yoke of her former slaves. The
shibboleth of the next campaigt is
white supremacy.
While we are on the subject we
wish to say a word concerning our
position, In our s-lutatory.we an
nounced our inseption of not talking
:2 i-CA 1½ . -
p:art in the fight between the two
fhacions of the Democratic party in
this parish.. We still adhere to that
principle, provided the fight is'
made within the Democrat party.
The fundamental principles of the
Democratic par"! are white rule
and white primaries. Democracy
and negro domination are as incom
patible as are the blazing furnace
of hell and the elysian throne of
heaven. Believing this, we shall
advocate white supremacy, not as a
political organ, but as an organ run
by a white man and a Democrat.
