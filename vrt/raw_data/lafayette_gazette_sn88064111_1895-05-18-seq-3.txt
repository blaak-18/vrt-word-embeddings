the monthly paper of Miss Marie
Roussel, of New Orleans, has been

large, clear type and is very neat

nothing of its literary merit as its
talented editor is too well known

eulogy from us. If you wish to

Sanple of Barley.
Leon Plonsky brought to The

McKane. We are informed that
this is the first barley cultivated in
this parish and Mr. McKane is entire
ly.satisfied with the results of his first
trial. He says that barley grows as
well here as in the North and there is
no reason why it should not be raised
extensively. It is spendid food for
stock and its cultivation requires
very little attention.

Annexation.
Romain Francez, the well-known
surveyor, has been at work survey
ing the territory to be re-annexed
to the town. We understand the
lines will be made to run so as to take
in Dr. Mudd's and Mr. Nickerson's
residences. We are informed that
residents of the additions will lose
no time in taking the necessary
steps to become citizens of Lafa
yette as soon as practicable. It is
needless to say that people in the
old and new town - appreciate
the necessity of immediate action
in this matter. The man that could
offer a -atlid reason to oppose re
annexation would indeed be a rare
curiosity, and would prove a great
attraction to a first-class museum.
We do not rnow of the existence of
any opposition, but shoul,' tnere be
any it will only prove the correct
ness of our statement some time
since that there live in every town a
few people who generally oppose
everything from which they do not
derive any personal benefit.
Another Clever Capture.
Sheriff Broussard left Tuesday
May 7, with a batch of prisoners
for the State penitentiary and on
his way to or from the capitol he
received a letter from the sheriff of
Rapides parish asking him to be on
the lookout for two mullatoes,
named John Winfield and Jos. Wise
who were wanted in Alexandria for
obtaining money under false pre
tenses. The sheriff knew that
these two negroes were experienced
and dangerous crooks and if he
wanted to capture them he would
have to do some tall hustling. So
with his accustomed vigor and de
votion to duty he immediately took
sIteps to locate the negro fugitives.
He found out that they were on
their way to ILake Charles and to
this place he directed his course,
ar.d before another day elapsed he
had WVinfiel.l and WVise in custody,
bringing them to L.afayette Satur
day on the afternoon train. The
Alexandria authorities were in
formed of the arrest and an officer
was sent for the prisoners.

clerk of court. Rumors have

Mark the assertion. More combi
nations will be made than a politi
cian can count, and that is saying
much.
The "old timers" are straining
their every nerve in plotting and
extending their lines. From infor
mation gathered, they will resort to
all tricks imaginable in order to

to see that their movements are
closely guarded.

MIOUTON-LABiBE.
When it comes to brilliant wed
dings Lafayette will always hold her
own with the best of them. Wed
dings in this delightful old town are
ever interesting and never fail to
attract as large a crowd to church
as did the visit of an archbishop be
fore the war. Last Wednesday the
beautiful chuich of St. John was
full of people who had assembled
there to witness the ceremony which
was to unite in wedlock two estim
able members of this community.
At the appointed hour the bridal
party arrited in front of th"- church
in carriages and then proceeded to
the altar to the inspiring strains of
Lohengriu's march in the following
order: Miss Ismene l.abbe, the
bridesmaid, becomingly attired in
dotted mull, and the groomns:nan,
Mr. Horace Mouton; then the
groom, Mr. Auguste V. Labbe, fol
lowed with his aunt, Mrs. Omer
Broussard; and next came the
bride, Miss Alice Mouton, dressed
in a fashionable weddi ng costume
of white crepon, trimmed with sa
tin ribbons and with the co:,ven
tional orange blossoms; she was ac
companied by her uncle, Mr. H. L.
Monnier. The ceremony was per
formed by Rev. Father Maltrait
who spoke a few appropriate words
of admonition to the young couple
After the ceremony Mr. and Mrs.
Labbe were driven to their new
home in this town where they will
reside. Me ibers of the families
accompanied them to their home
where a quiet reception was held.
They were the re "ipients of many
handsome presents.
NECROLOGICAL.
Alfred Voorhies died at his home
in this town last Saturday evening
at the age of 64 y)ears. Mr. Voor
hies was a son of the distin
guished lawyer, Cornelius Voor
hies, who was a leading member
of the bar in ante-bellum
times and served on tLe supreme
beach with conspicuous ability. In
those days Judge Voorhies, Sr.,
lived in St. Martinville and it was
there the deceased spent the first
years of his life, until le was sent
to St. Charles college, where he :e
mained from the age of 8 years to
that of 17, when he graduated, hav
ing completed a th',r.,ughly clas
sical course. He chose the pro
fession of law and was sent to the
Harvard law school; among his
class-mates were Col. Gus Breaux,
Edmond Breaux and Leopold Sinm"
the latter dying while at school.
Although well equipped for the le
gal profession he never engaged in
its practice. The life of the law
yer was not congenial to his nature.
The sedentary requirements of the
law office did not suit him and he
earned a livelihood in other pursuits.
When the war broke out he
!joined the other true south
erners and enlisted in the
Orleans Guards, serving the
Confederacy with undeviating faith
fulness until all brave Southrons
had to lay down their arms before
a mightier adversary. \Vith' the
sweet satisfaction of duty well done
he returned to his home in St. Mar
tinville and spent the balance of his
life with his beloved wife and children
and among those who recognized his
personal worth and delighted
to honor him when the opportunity
presented itself. A short time after
the end of hostilities, when the un
scrupulous carpet-baggers incited
the black voters to acts of un
endurable impudence and infamy,
Alfred Voorhies was one of the
first to join the white people
in a movement to free them
selves from the shackles of oppres
sion of black radicalism. ie was a
Democrat, and to him Democ.racy
meant white sutnremacy. He was
true to that faith in the dark days
of reconstruction and he remained
true to it until his death. When
the whites gained control of the
political affairs of St. Martin P'arish
he was eltcted to the Legislature
and a consecutive service of tei
years in that body shows how satis
factorily he performed his duties.
Mr. Voorhies was a man of strong
family affection and literally adored
his children. ie was married forty
six y: ars ago to Miss Eulphroisin'i
Olivier, who stood by his sick-be'd
day and night during l.is ,on,
and painful illness. Hie was an car
nest Christian and before dying re
ceived the sacraiments of the Catno
lic church of which i hc was a life
memmicer. Hie met dleath with tihat
resignation which always coe.s to
the true Chri;tian in his la t mo
mnents on earth. His litiali con
dittion during a lingering illne  . 0
nally Itmolnth-s can not be cioiitei
platedl wIithullt evoking fE''li;: ,r
sincere sorrow. Although s,.frin.
from a painful a50. incur- bie .i
sease, lie retained to t.e last hi
kindly disposition, displayin a mi-ni
rable fortitude until tc;: ang'l 0,
ldeath ended his sufferings ani
closed his eyes to all carthly thing
for eternity.
Itis mortal remains were takcu:
to St. M artinville for intenrment in
the family vault.
