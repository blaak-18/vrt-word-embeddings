RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY
SOUTH FRANKLIN COUNTY
UNION.
/
Whereas, the exchanges of this
country do gamble on the products of
the farmers of the United States, to
their detriment, to the amount of
millions of dollars every year; and
whereas, the President of the United
States has shown some disposition
to have the matter investigated by
the Federal Government; and
whereas, President C. S. Barrett and
other leading men in the Farmers’
Union are in Washington to use their
influence and means to have Con
gress pass laws to prevent any gam
bling whatever on these exchanges;
therefore be it
Resolved by the County Union in
session this the 21st of February,
1910, Do enter our protest against
these exchanges in their present
form, and instruct our United States
> Senators and Representatives in Con
gress to use their utmost influence
against these exchanges in their pres
ent state of affairs.
Resolved also, That a copy of these
resolutions be sent to each member
of the Senate and Congress from this
State.

RESOLUTIONS.
Whereas, it is the desire of the
Money Trust, led by J. P. Morgan, to
destroy the $346,000,000 treasury
notes now circulating among the peo
ple, and substituting national bank
notes in their stead; therefore be it
Resolved, first, That we view with
alarm any further destruction of the
people’s money and adding to the
banker power to oppress by creating
made-to-order panics. We are unal
terably opposed to the scheme now
being proposed by the kings of high
finance, known as the Central Bank,
which will put the people more com
pletely at the mercy of the concen
trated banking power than any plan
heretofore advanced.
Second. We are opposed to the
ship subsidy, or any other Subsidy
that builds up one industry at the
expense of another.
Third. We are opposed to any in
crease of postage on second-class
publications.
Fourth. We favor the parcels post.
Fifth. We thank Hon. T. E. Wat
son for the information he has given
us in regard to the actions of some
of our Union leaders, also for the
fearless manner in which he defends
our rights.
Sixth. That a copy of these reso
lutions be sent to Hon. A. P. Piyo,

PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
Martin, Tenn.
“I had a curiosity to see
whether the Primitive Baptist
was as unfair, hide-bound, ar
rogant and abusive as the pa
pers run by missionary fa
natics. . . . To my agreeable
surprise I found that the
whole build and spirit of the
paper was up to my ideal of a
Christian paper. ... In choos
ing your religious reading,
you might give the Primitive
Baptist a trial, even though
you are not of that faith and
order. You’ll get some really
religious literature, if you
do.”—Thos. E. Watson in The
Jeffersonian of February 17.
1910.
