were compelled to forego the pleas

in the interest of immigration. No
boats passed up during the entire

PARISH OF VERNON, di
Septenmber 30th, 1877.
Dear Vindicator :
In looking over the Ng Orleans
Christianu Adrocate the olier day, I
saw a statement to the effect that the P1
National Bank Assoiation had at a de
recent meeting taken steps to influ- -
ence Congress (if possible) to relieve
the National Banks from taxation, and
to confer with Secretary Sherman as to
.th~ most effective means of bringing
about specie resumption as speedily
as possible. Why should not these
thieving cormorants called National
Bankers who have stolen untold mil
lions from the people, pay taxes to tiheJ
govermnent that foster and nourishes
them 9 Whyshould they be exempt.
ed from taration, when tile plow-hold
er, the miner, the mechanic, (in short)
the toilingmilionsorthe country have
to be taxed in a mlanner and to an ex
tent unparalelled in tile history of the
world. Just think, over $100,000,000,
000 (one hundred billions) have been
filched from the people within the last
fifteen years ;n the way of taxes or
revenus, and where has itgonet to pay r
the interest on bonds that are in the
possession (to a great extent) of these
same National Bankers, for although
Mir Banker deposits his bonds with the
Treasurer of the United States as a
basis upon which to begin his oper
ationsas a National Banker, the gov
erment pays him interest regularly
and that in gold which perhaps has Fl
been Lought of this same National
Banker at a high premium, thus en
able him to make a tripple interest,
first he draws interest on his Bond in
Gold (he recognises nothing else as
coin, the goverment at his bidding
having demonetized Silver) next he
sells the goverment, Gold with which
to pay that interest, and thirdly he
issues his "National Bank currency"
and loans it to the trader, and the
speculator, and often thle goverment
itself, at 10 and 15 per ceot, not yet
satisftled, he confers with Secretary
Shierman as to the most speedy
means ot bringing about specio re
sumption, because he knows that is a
but another name for the issue of E
untaxable bonds which will increase
the demand for his shin-plaster cur
rency (for you know that a national

Veteran ('oI ton.
MN. Eu):'r R :-Abhout the 20th Au
gust I was forced to apply Paris
Green on certain portions of my cot
ton to destroy qulite a1 ii tlnoousI arlmy
of worms. In one locality I noticed
several volunteer stalks of cotton
together in the middle of the turning
row knee high, and without any ma
tured bolls, on which I applied p:iris
green by means of a splrinkler, thor
onghly wetting the leaves. I sue
ceeded at that time inl destroy ing
every worm where the green was ap
plied. Three or fotiur weeks stubse
quently, millions of worms hatched
all over my tiehl of cotton, destroyed
the cotton leaves where Io green was
fo'ierly applied entirely ; not fin1d
ing food sutlicient, were 'coinlsequent
lv travelling in every direction hunt
ing more, and in their hunt millions
and millions perished, while others
at full age of maturity webbed. The
paris greened cotton was being dis
troyed very slowly, and upon close
observation I found many dhead
worms, poisoned by the infected pla t
which at that time was being iltank 1
ed by millions of worms tro. ,,
cotton, and was finally dest( -
but with difficulty, and only atfti r
having killed numbers of worms. To
my great astonishment, the isolatred
brbunch of '"veteran cotton" is still
gireen, although pertforated with ianiy
of the slain under ita branches. and
omnie on its leaves, having nii tuted
blls anrd will onward glow until
"old King White" bids it stop. I
will also state tat t there is toi be
fouind here and there in the ltops ,of
the paris green cotton, portions of
leaves npon which dead worrus are
lying. This is snflicient proof that
where the paris green is properly ap
iplied woirtS are iot to be feared. I
ened first tire paris green in a pork
barrel with water, simply stirring c
the mixture continually while using.
The cotton was not perceptibly af- r
ficted, except where the green settled
on the leaves decaying them in spots.
It retained anrd matured all young
bowls it hnd at the time of aplliea
tion of the green, anid etolti n ed to
bloomn anr d partially mature more up
to time of distruction which was
only completed la t week, on 29th
