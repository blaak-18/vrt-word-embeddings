The Fire at Rlayte.
Our sister town, kayne, was the
victim of a very destructive fire last
Thursday. The tire occurred aldr
ing the strong wind *hich blew
over this section the whole of the
day and having no fire protection
the people of that town were unable
to do anything to combat the flames.
The fire orignated in MNr. Besse's
saloon and made short work of
a number of buildings the number
of which we have failed to learn.
Among those reported burned ate t~he
followi ng.
De:;se's saloon, Ed. Smith's two
story b-uilding, Dave Levy's large
store, Druno's livery stable and sad
diery, G. DLerouen'.s store and reci
dence, Paul Hlebert s saldoo,.
An Early Blaze.
At about 3 o'clock Tuesday morn
ing Mr. iVm. Huff was surprised to
discover his barn on fire. Though
the flames had already consumed
the upper portion of the building
prompt and intelligcnt work saved
the balance of it. Mr. Huff was
fortunate in receiving the assistance
of the '"crC*" ftom the railroad
yard who worked hard to put out
the fire. Mr. Huff desires to thank
these gentlemen for their efficient
work, especially to the old veteran
railroader. Henry Church.
"A Doublc He ader".
The west-bound Sunset Limited,

Free Pills.
Send your address to H. E. Bucklen & Co.,
Chicago, and get a free sample box of D)r.
King's New L.ife Pills. A trial will convince
you of their merits. These pills are easy in
action and are particurai'y dffective in the
cure of Constipation and Sick HIeadache
For Malaria and Liver troishles they have
beei proved, invaluable. They are guar
anteed to be perfectly free from every
deleterious substance and to be "Sirely vege
table. They do not weaken by their actions
but by giving tone to stomach and boevil!s

One Fourcadc, a fieegr6 living in

Broussard Tuesday for carrying a
concealed weapon. He appeared
before Justice MclFadden and flb
nishstd appearance bond. It seenrh
that Fourcade was in the habit of
coming to town armed with a pistol
and gave as an excuse that s6she
parties had threateedri his life and
he carried a weapon to protect him
self, but Sheriff Broussard did not
take the same view of the nmattcr
and placed F'ourcade under arrdti.
It is hardly probable. that he will
liake a walkin arsenal of himself
i"n the future.

AT ROYVILLE.
HlappeningA.. in the Busy and
Thrifty Town -- Reportd
for the Columns of The
Gazette.
Outside of a limined number of
"smart AleckPs' always attending to
other people's business, the past
week in Roybille hah been one of
the usual order.
It is a fact times are hard, but
notwithstanding that daily cry of
"crisis" still the matrimonial altar
is never devoid of a plicants.
Mr. Aladin Broussard .. lost a
child lately. Mr. J. Babtiste
Bourc also had the misfortune of
seeing his little daughter, a years
old, depait for thd other home.
Our sympathies to the berea-"ed.
Many complaints have reached
us of late, regarding the impassable
con'dition of the bridge in the rear
of Mr. F. Rkjeau's property. The
corporation atithorities should look
into this matter, and either
repair or rebuild the bridge. We
are reliably informed that that
bridge has been abandoned for the
last eight or ten months.
Mr. Alcee T1rahan returned from
New Orleans Saturday, where he
has been coi .bining business with

Mrs. Scranton has been confined
to her room for several days. We
hope she will soon recover, and
enjoy her usual good health.

Hon. O'Cade was at "Bellevue"

All persons in need of spectacles

A Iloy Killed.
The Sunset Limited train No.
loot arrived at this station fifty
minutes late. It was delt-ayed at
Beaumont whLtere it ran over a boy
who fell under the wheels of the
locomotive iti attemptiang to cross
a short culvert. Fhiginecr Richie,
who was at the throttle, endeavored
to stop the tr.ait in time to save
the life of the little fellow, but hi:
could not do so. No blame can bc
attached to aty; of the inca for the I
accident.
Th'le hCial Futi'ds.
As there has been considerable
talk about cloAlng tase public schools
T'he Gazette feels certain the fol
lowing information as to the reve
nues will pro-e of gratifying interest
to the general public.
Cash State a!pro!,riation ............$S 20x 0oo

tion ................. ....................... 10ou 00
Poll taxes collected by clerk ...... 800 o0
City Council appr-opriation.......... 400 00

The above sum may be some
what increased- by poll taxes and
lines from the sherifft's olhce. It
is safe to say therefore that there
is no immediate prospect of schools
closing, and we sincerely hope the
board will succeed in keeping
them open the full term.
-Making a Record.
Ben Young, the yot)ung negro who

'ee for yourself. If you accept the
truth of the assertion, c ome anyway
and have a good time.
Thit dance givenk by the young
nien of Carencro at Guilbeau's Hall
last Saturday, proved as was ex
pected a very pleasanit entertain
inent. The club posseses the hap
py faculty of making their gather- i
ings thoroughly enjoyable. A large
tiumber of ladies and gentlemen
fro-o Breaux Bridge, Lafayette,
Broussardville, arid Huron were
present, and expressed themselies
delighted with their reception.
Dr. J. P. Francez accompained

Miss Florina Grenier was a visi

It is a mystery to your corre
spo:ident, why our farmers have
given up poultry rai.,ing so comnplete
ly. Some sik years ago the aver
age daily shipment of eggs from this
pI1lace amounted to 450 dozens,
while to-day it does not exceed-l 9
dozens. There is nothing that the
farmlers can raise that he caln so
sure'ly and safely calculate upon.
This section is peculiarly and par
I ticii arly adaptedl for that very line
Sof b i.nes-:, and if they would only {
give to it the same almount of care,
that they are conmpetile to be.,tow
upon any crop they cIltivnate, tihec
would fare better and r:chciv sa:is
factory returns for their labor. The
product of the poultry yard! ii vorth
fully as much now if not imore than
during the licriod we referrecd to,
while the cost of tra:siportations in
materially less.

To Reduce Taxation.
ScoTT LA., Ft-E. , IS935.
Pursuant to notice a large, crowd
of tax-payers of the first and eighth
wards of this parish met at Scott, at
the appointed hour, 2 p. in.
Mr. Alex Delhomme called the
meeting to order and explained in
a few words the object thereof.
He then called on Mr. Louis C.
Breaux to preside.
The following resolutions, intro
duced by Mr. Alex Delhomme, were
unanimously adopted:
.WHrIRr.:,s, The low prices of farm
products have produced an amount
of agricultural and business depre:
sion, simply appalling; and where
as, the present rate of assessment,
while fair enough under the old or
dcr of things, would, under the
present conditions be entirely too
high, at the rate cotton and cane
.antl the other fruits of the earth are
now selling or likely to sell for dur
ing the comine year;
Th/er'fore, Be it resolved: That we
respectfully request the Board of
Reviewers to reduce the assessments
on the farms throughout the parish
to such a figure that the farmers
may be able to meet their obliga
tions without having their homes
sold for taxes.
'c it fuir/Acr rcslve'e.I, That a
copy of these resolutions be for
warded to The Gazette and Adver
tiser and that a cnn:;nittee of three
from each ward be appointed to
wait upon the Board of Reviewers
to present a copy of t-hese resolr
tions and to take such further ac
tion in the premises as may redound
to the adz'anztage of the farmers.
The president then appointed the
following tax-payers in accordanct
with the resolutions, to-wit: From
first ward: Alonzo Lacy, Alex Del
heomme, Sr., Dominique Arceneaux;
From Eight ward: J. S. Whittington,
Louis G. Breaux, S. J. Montgomery.
'the meeting then adjourned.
