Frlnl the l:utropean side of this great
round world conies in reproachful toncs
the assertini that we have no diplottats
in this country. Measureid from the
standard of Europeans we have not. \
skilled diplomat is one who is always
playing ftr something he would not
have: a doluble dealer whose ambitiotn
is to entangle and mislea'd and in the
end get the best of a had hargain. Re
ferring to Minister Bowen. who is man
aging for \Venezuela. the high-felluted
and high-felluting. trained diplomats of
Europe look tpon him as a crude and
somewhat vulgar product of the United
States, a plain, blunt man who knows
little of conventionalities and who is
sufficiently indiscreet as to state his case
clearly and then rest on his demands.
'*lhe trained diplomats of G(rmany and
England and litaly and all others inter
ested more or less in their grab-all in
,Venezuela have been pleading with him
in vain. Bowetni as an American, has
long since realized that the diplomat of
Europe who is regarded as the most
skillful is lie who can indulge in the
greatestlatitudte of tergiversion-in the
words of the United States. lying- and
as Bowen is a truthful man and Ino
"bluffer" he has simply called the ga:me
of bluff. and it in ligurative sense, Eng
land and I;e.rmany are on their heads
kicking in air. Neither cajoling or in
sinuated threat have moved the plain
hltunt American it his stand for justice
and right. When pressed to I ounds uit
reasonable he has pointed to The Hague
tribunal for settlementl, atnd there will
be adjusted on fair andl hoIor:ale terms,
to all conccrned the differences and the
Mlaims ,which have led England and
Giernmany to make forceful and forcible
denmands on. Venezuela. And. after all,
American diplomacy has prevailed
against European idiplomacy. In other
words, that crude, vulgar interloper of
an American has cleaed tup the heat
and nust skillftl liars of Europe.

all reunions'and it will afford the
"Generals." the "Colonels," the "Ma

opportunity for display. However, there
is sode consolation in the reflection that
every old "Johnny 'Reb" will be wel

of having been a "web-foot" or a buttef

I expect this storm to cross the con

a second center passing over thle gull

Februa;ry 18 great central valleys 20,

This cool wave is not expected to be
severe. It will keep well o the north.
passing over the great lakes and east
ern Canada.
The disturbance mentioned above cov
ering about one week including the
warmest part of February and the se
verest stormts of the month.
The Cheyenne, Wyo., Leader recent
ly said: "Again is Prof. Foster vindi
cated as a weather prophet. He prom
ised its a cold wave this week with,
snow, and we got. it. The Cheyenne Ice
Company lhanked so ahsolutely on his
predictions that they made all their ar-,
rangements for cutting ice next Mo1n
day."
Following date of this bulletin a cold
wave will come down the Missouri and
proceed slowly eastward.
Temperature of weeek ending Febru
ary t6 will average above and rainfall
below normal.
Fifty daily newspapers were added'
last week to the list that regularly pub
fish my weather bulletins, and hereafter
at least too papers will publish them
weekly. The list is rapidly growing and
how great the increase will be I can not
gutess. Evidently my forecasts are gain-'
