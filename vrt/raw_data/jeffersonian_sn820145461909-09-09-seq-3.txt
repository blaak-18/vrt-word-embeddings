THE VETERANS’ CORNER
ONLY WOMAN ON PENSION
ROLLS DIES.
Washington, Aug. 26.—Mrs. Sarah
E. Thompson, the only woman car
ried on the rolls of the pension of
fice as a soldier of the Union army,
died here yesterday and attorneys in
behalf of her surviving children
have filed suit against a local trac
tion company for damages. They
allege that Mrs. Thompson died of
injuries received last April, when
struck by a car belonging to the de
fendant company. Mrs. Thompson,
whose real name was Mrs. Sarah E.
Cotton, she having married twice,
was recognized as a soldier largely
because of the services she rendered
during the latter part of the Civil
War by discovering and reporting to
the Federal troops the hiding place
of John Morgan, the Confederate
general, who invaded and terrorized
Ohio. He was killed while in hiding
after escape from prison.
Ed. Note: —We clip the above
from the Atlanta Journal.
Gen. Morgan was not killed while
hiding. After his escape from the
Ohio penitentiary, where he was sub
jected to humiliating treatment by
negro guards, he determined never
again to fall into the hands of the
enemy. Having resumed operations
with his command, he imprudently
took up his quarters at a private
house almost unattended. Betrayed
and surprised, he ran for his horse,
and was shot down trying to escape
capture.
DICKINSON’S INSULT.
Dear Sir: —I have been reading
with great interest your articles on
Foreign Missions and many others.
It is amusing with what ease you
bring to naught your opponents.
Their ground is untenable; they have
no “Thus sayeth the Lord.” I was
very much pleased with the way you
showed up Mr. Dickinson and his
harangue at Gettysburg on Memorial
Day. That hallowed ground where
so many of us left our footprints and
many a leg or an arm, and others
their life blood, in defense of our sa
cred rights bequeathed to us in and
by our fathers. It would have been
bad enough for one born over the
Mason and Dixon lines to have been
guilty of such rot, but for a man
claiming Southern birth to be guilty
of such lack of patriotism and mis
representation of our just cause, it
puts him in the class with Benedict
Arnold. His tirade was virtually
stating that we fought for a cause for
which we are now sorry.
I went through the whole war, was
at Gettysburg and was with Lee
when he surrendered at Appomatox,
and I want to say, with the same
provocation I would do the same
thing again after forty years’ deliber
ation. Some people will talk about no
North, no South, no East and no
West; it is all bosh —at this very
time the Congress at Washington is
working just as hard to keep the
South impoverished as it did forty
years ago. All the North wants from
tne South is her cotton and her tax or
tribute money to help pay their sol
diers a big bounty for degrading us.
They have it in their power to keep
up the fight as long as they wish, but
I for one will not help them to do it.
I never was bound to eat dust. I
want the Northern soldiers to know
that we, the soldiers of the South,
have nothing but good feeling for
them. The men that did the fighting
had nothing to do with bringing on
the war on either side. We of the
South know who our enemies are.
We know it was the politician that
brought it on and it is the same poli
ticians who are keeping up the im
positions now. If we are a Christian
nation, as we claim to be, we should
forget the past and look forward to
the future and strive to make the
best of it for all concerned.
A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER,
Dyed in the Wool.
WHAT CAUSED THE WAR?
Historians have been busy assign
ing causes for the terrible war of
1861-65, which desolated the south
ern section of the United States and
destroyed an institution which had
become a part of its domestic life.
The war is attributed to ignorance
of each other in the two sections of
the Union, to sectional prejudice, to
conflict of economic interests, to dif
ferent interpretations of the Consti
tution, to ambitious rivalries for su
premacy in the government.
No doubt each of these factors con
tributed to bring about the final out
break of hostilities and to the bitter
ness of the struggle. But in reality
it was a war of conscience against
conscience—a conflict of moral ideals.
Each side believed it was contending
for righteousness against iniquity.
The North thought it was fighting
against an order of society unjust and
oppressive; the South believed it was
fighting for a social order in the main
kindly and beneficent. The North
fought for a theory of human rights;
the South for a condition, the best
conserver of actual rights of two
races widely different yet forced to
live together.
It is frequently said that if the
Northern people had known the ac
tual condition of the slaves in the
South and the kind feeling which in
general subsisted between master
and slave, then all bitterness of feel
ing would have disappeared and the
radical demands of the abolitionists
would have been so modified that the
questions could have been settled
without war.
But the chief obstacle to settle
ment was that these abolitionists,
with their active propaganda, would
not accept any fact that would con
trovert their theory of human rights.
Intensely prejudiced and partisan
writers w*th very limited opportuni
ties to know all the facts went
through the South to observe condi
tions. They reported the exception
al cases of cruelty and oppression,
and their statements were accepted
as gospel, which no amount of evi
dence could invalidate as to the ter
rible condition of the slaves and the
tyranny of the masters. Thus the
conscience of the Northern people
was aroused against a system for
which they felt the nation was re
sponsible. At the same time the con
science of the Southern people resent
ed what they felt was an injustice to
them and a false judgment of their
institutions.
When conscience is involved in any
great question, compromises are only
Jeffersonian
temporary. At length it has to be
settled by force, the appeal to arms,
that ultima ratio regum. Although
the result of the appeal is not neces
sarily just and righteous, war never
settles the right or wrong of any
thing. * It often only establishes some
giant wrong. One of the mightiest
agencies of oppression and injustice
in this world has been a perverted
conscience. Our Savior warned his
disciples that their persecutors would
think they did God service. And the
horrors of the Inquisition were in
flicted by conscientious ecclesiastics.
No doubt many of those who accom
plished the emancipation of the slaves
in the South at such fearful cost of
blood and treasure, of life and suffer
ing, have the approval of their own
consciences, and congratulate them
selves on their success as agents of
God’s righteousness. Yet we of the
South, who were the victims of that
conscience, believe that it was blind
ed, perverted, and unjust. And our
consciences do not reproach us for
having resisted to the utmost of our
power.
It was essentially the Puritan con
science which forced on the war. And
inasmuch as the Southern conscience
was as firm in its conviction as to the
duty of resistance, the war was in
evitable. My observation of the Puri
tan and my reading of his history
leads me to think that when he has
made up his mind as to what is right
no amount of fact is allowed to in
terfere with his course. Every one
must admire his stern devotion to
principle as he sees it, his firmness of
purpose, his self-sacrificing zeal, his
energy, his independence of thought,
and his brave assertion of that inde
pendence at any cost.
But on the other hand I have noted
an intolerance of opposition, an as
sumption of infallibility in judgment,
a self-confidence which would de
nounce the Almighty if he differed
from the Puritan idea, a willingness
to deny or to pervert and misrepre
sent facts, to sustain a theory which
have led to Persecution and oppres
sion in order to establish a certain
theory or course of conduct. So in
the early days of New England Bap
tists and Quakers were banished be
cause their consciences could not con
form to those of the Puritan.
In the course of nearly half a cen
tury as a minister of the gospel I
have had various illustrations of this
peculiarity of the Puritan conscience
which will not accept any fact that
would contradict its moral ideals.
And let it be said that the Puritan
has been so masterful in the realm
of higher thinking that he has molded
and controlled the ideals of the whole
northern section of our country. He
has claimed liberty to his own opin
ions, also liberty to force them on
others.
Starting my ministerial life with
the highest admiration for the Puri
tan, I fear I shall close it with a feel
ing of utter revolt against his char
acter as an enemy of true liberty of
conscience. This feeling applies only
to the English Puritan, from Crom
well down, until I sometimes wonder
whether to class the great Lord Pro
