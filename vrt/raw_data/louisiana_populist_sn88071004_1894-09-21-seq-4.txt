I take this method of expressing
my thanks to you fir the valuable
services you are renderinug me in
extending my influtnce and my
reign in that dominion. I have
just ,been looking over the last an
nual rleport of my chief secretary
and find more reernits that have
joined my army and are now
unarching along thle broad road to
IlHades than has been furnished by
any other lplanet.
Afte'r a thorough and exhaustive
trial I find that poverty on the one
hand and riches oI tlhe other are
the most effective means I have
ever tried to enlist recruits for my
dominions. It beats snakes all to
pieces. At one time I despaired
of ever making any headway on
earth. Everylwly was empldoyed
at good wages, and were too busy
to stop and conlsider any of uny
methods. Everybody seemed to
be happy and contented. At this
time Baron Itothschilds, who is my
most efficient agent andl able ad
viser in that donminion (I bought
his soul many years ago), advised
me to adopt a scheme that would
make the masses por1' and the few
rich. I consented, and through
Mr. RIothchilds, secured the aid of
John Sherman in the United
States. We then issued the lIa
zard Circular to catch the bankers
and capitalists. They bit beyond
all our expectations. Then we is
sued the Buel Circular to obtain
control of congress. We succeed
ed. For thirty years I have had
better control of the American
congress than I have of the Great
Sanhedrim here in Hades, which is
composed of defaulting bank presi
dents and corporation lawyers.
When the United States govern
meat issued greenbacks we had
congress to declare it good money
for the poor, but not for the rich
capitalist. We then had the gov
ernment to issue bonds for which
we could exchange, at face value,
this greenback stuff, which was
good enough for the soldier and
the people who had to work for a
living.
We ridiculed this money until we
depreciated it in value, and then
we bought it up and exchanged it
for bonds bearing coin interest.
With this interest ~e, bought
some more paper money and ex.
changed it for more bonds. Then
we had the government to pass a
law allowing us to deposit these
bonds and draw some paper money
(national baAk notes) of obtr own.
We exchanged these notes for
greenbacks and then traded the
greenbacks for more bonds. De
posited the bonds for more bank
notes; traded the bank notes for
more greenbacks; and the green
backs for more bonds. We kept
up this racket until we got all the
bonds, and then we had the gov
ertunentto pas a law to destroy
most bf the greenbacks, sad an
othbr. w to pay the bonds we held
in cola.
Then we got congress to demone
tize silver.
We now had almost complete
control of the currency according
to the programme laid down in the
Haard Cimalar.
We put the screws to the people
and pradaced the panic of 1873.
Pdces of property sank lower and
l-wer.
My agents had the money and
they began loaning it out at uasury.
When the national bank charter
ran ouet I had eongress to renew it.
in 1878 we had to yield a ittle
and emin some of the silve, and l
lowe1d congress to pass the Bland

ia demomithg alve. aga. We
Sal peedmeed another panic. We
have nw get thiapg nearly uas we
want them. The next move is to
is~sue more bonds and destroy what
greenbacks there are left.
We have got the people thirty
billion dollars in debt.
They have to pay the interest in
gold. We have got the gold.
They have got to sell their souls
to us to get it.
They are selling their souls for
it. Congressmen are selling their
souls for gold and patronage.
I've got a cinch on them.
Thousands of young, beautiful
women are thrown out of enmploy
ment. With them it is starve or
sell their souls for bread.
My agents who have the money
are buying their souls by the thous
alltl.
I am filling up hell with them.
Poverty is driving thousands to
crlne. I am putting in new and
improved machines for the manu
tiacture of brimstone.
My imps are busy night and day
sharpening the prongs on their
forks to stir up the congregation.
In a few more years I will close
my mortgage on earth.
I will then enjoy the greatest ag
gregation of variegated shrieks
that has ever been known in hell.
In conclusion, allow me to thank
yon for the very valuable assis
tance you are rendering me. I
have no discrimination to make
between the Democratic and Re
publican parties. They are chil
dren after my own heart. They
keep the people divided and fight
ing each other, while we impover
ish them. They have been the
means of sending more people to
hell than all other things combin
ed. Without them we never could
have managed congress. As it is,
the people have voted for every
thing we have done. In other
words, they have voted thousands
of virtuous women, innocent chil
dren and honest men into hell.
Let us rejoice, my trusty agents,
that it is so. Eat, drink and be
merry to-day, for to-morrow ye may
die. Remember, our contract was
that you were to enjoy yourself on
ly on earth. See that you do it.
The hottest of all Ares is reserved
for you. I want to hear you
scream. I shall take fiendish de
light in seeing you take your last
farewell of earthly joys. You shall
never lack attention when you
come here. The fires shall never
smoulder. I'm after all the souls
I can get, but I've "got it in for
you," especially. My next letter
will be to the candidates.
Yours for everything in sight,
SATIN DEVIL.

We will let the readers make the
comparison as regards the love for
silver, as shown by the two old
parties.
Why They Leave The Old Party.
It is bad enough when a nation has to
use its military force against foreign
enemies, but when the necessity arises
to use the military power for the quash
ing of international strifes, we must
look it as the manifestation of deep
rooted unhappiness, dissatisfaction and
injustice.
In such an event a good government
would not be content with merely assert
ing its physical power. It would attempt
to find the causes for that internal strife
and eradicate them. The conduct of the
republican and of the democratic parties
the utterances of their press and their
statesmen, do not at all inspire me with
confidence that a government controlled
by either of these parties is able or will
ing to cure our social ills. Both of these
parties have up to this time legislated
for property interests only. Such legis
lation, however, must widen the gulf
between the classes already existing.
At all times and in all countries: the
wealthy classes have become and are the
upper classes, and the producers or
workers the lower class. Whether this
distinction has been established by law,
or whether, as in our republic with the
oretically equal right, it has been left to
establish itself by the mere operation of
conditions makes no practical difference.
All social and political progress of socie
ty has emanated from below and not
from above. History produces no in
stance to the contrary. Dissatisfaction
is the mother of progress. The satisfac
tion with conditions that are and the
desire to perpetuate them, are not crea
tive of something new. Progressive
ideas arises only in the minds of those
who suffer under existing conditions or
those who feel for their fellow-beings
and study their ills.
1 claimn to belong to the latter. I aim
to be a progressive man, and because the
People's party is a party composed of
the dissatisfied, aiming at progressive
legislation, and although there is still
some confusion and inconsistency in the
thoughts of its leaders, I have placed the
little talent which nature has given me
at the service of this party being coa
fident that it will progress in thought
and principle, cast aside all rubbish in
its theories, and that it will help toward
establishing a system of society in which
the right of man is paramount to the
rights of property, a system of social or
ganization creative of happiness and
content for all. It must put government
upon a higher plane, under which it has
to perform higher functions than merely
thoeb of a night watchman guarding
property; and above all, it must create
liberty for the use of man's faculties in
dependent of the possession of pro
pety.
Though our opponents call this, as
they probably will. glittering generai
ties, time will prove that I am right.
and that the lessons which I draw from
history are true.
That the above is from an intel
ligent mind, is not to be questioned
and that his conclusions are correct
is indisputable. The sooner the
people unite in this determination
the better it will be for the coun
try.
ED. FORuM.-I have just read
the preamble and resolutions of the
4th Congressional Executive Com
mittee, relative to submitting the
claims of the -People's and Demo
cratic candidates to white prima
ries, which to my mind is the most
just and feasible plan to settle our
differences and maintain the plea
of white supremacy yet proposed.
I hope the People's party Execu
tive Committee of the 5th District
will lose no time in this matter.
The propositions are fair, honest
and legitimate. I believe every
Populist in this district would be
willing to submit to a majority of
white votes fairly and honestly
rendered; and if the Democrats
should refuse so just a proposition,
it would forever silence their plea
of white supremacy and show them
to the world as being insincere.
I hope that each committeeman
yourself and all interested-will
urge immediate action in this mat
ter.
I wish to thank the Monroe Bul
letin for so fair and impartial re
port of the Populist convention;
it speaks well for the management
of said paper. I am glad also to
note that said paper says that Hon.
A. Benoit the People'e candidate
for Congress, is an honest man,
which to my mind is the highest
honor that could be conferred on
any one. But the Bulletin thinks
he made a mistake in quitting the
Democratic party. I fail to see
how he could claim the honor of
honesty and do otherwise, after
endorsing the Ocala demands. It
is certainly the strongest argument
possible to the claim.--J. W. Burt
