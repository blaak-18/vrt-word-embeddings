TOWN AND COUNTRY.
Mr. W. A;: Wartelle, of Opelou
sas, father of Mrs. Felix Salles, was
in Lafayette for a few days this week.
We understand that Julia.' Mr.
ton will be a candidate for repre.:.
tative subject to nomination by tie
Democratic party.
Mr. and Mrs. Adrien Salle: went
over to New tberia Monday to pass
a few days in that city visiting rela
tives and friends.
The Gazette was favored with a
call the first of the week by Messrs.
J. O. Blanchet and R. Domengeau,
of Royville.
Another batch of about zoo of
the unemployed westerners drifting
southward, passed through Lafa
yette Tuesday.
Miss Emeranthe Domengeaux,
a charming young lady from Breaux
Bridge, was on a visit to her many
friends in Lafayette this week.
Our merchants are all claiming to
be doing good business. It is no
ticeable that ntaay people are circu
lating in town every day, and that
means trade.
We saw a prettily decorated show
window in our rambles this week,
and as it was seemingly done to at- i
tract the attention ofthe passer-by t
we'll let the general public do like j
we did-discover the place.
Our friend Fred Mouton, having
finished and delivered over to its
owner, the pretty cottage erected by
him in St. Martinsville, returned
home this week, and we are sorry te v
note, slightly under the weather.
Mrs. A. V. Fleming, wife of St.
Martinsville's Mayor, and her son I
Paul, arrived in Lafayette by Wed
nesday evnning's train, and spent a
few days in the city the guests of
Mrs. Homer Bailey.
Sheriff Broussard arrested Solo
mon Johnson, a desperate and
dangerous negro, at Bayou Sale
and brought him here Wednesday.
Johnson is wanted for stab
bing and almost killing one Gilleen
a short time ago. -
If the condition of the town treas
ury will warrant it, The Gazette
thinks a plank walk on either side of
the street fronting Mr. Vigneaux's
livery stable, and extending along "
the street, in which Mr. Constan
tin's stable is located, wouldi not
only prove a great convenience, but
would improve the general view con
siderably.
The course of Governor Foster,
as chief executive of the State, upI
to date, is without a flaw. Should
he continue to administer the af
fairs of the State in the way he has
started, he will continue to grow in
public esteem, although it would be
difficult for him to gain more fully
the confidence of the people.
Bycicling on-- the sidewalks is a
confounded nuisance, and should
be abated by the town council. In
New Iberia they are relegated to the
streets, and that's just their proper
place. It is decidedly inconvenient
to say the least, for a lady or for
that matter any one else, to be an
noyed in giving right of way so
that Mr. Bycicler can be accom
modated. Let the council act.
At a cost of $xooo, I)r. H. P.
Guilbeau & Son, of Breaux Bridge,
have just acquired the magnificent
standard bred and pedigreed stal
lion Hal Clay. Last Thursday
this animal was in Crouchet's stable
and was looked at by many
lovers of fine horse flesh. Hal Clay
will be put into service on the stock
farm of these gentlemen.
Rev. Father LaForest and Prof.
F. C. Latiolais, of Carencro, gave
The Gazette a call last Tuesday.
We understand they were in the
city to see about the arrangements
incidental to the theatrical repre
sentation that will be given at
Falk's Opera House tonight. As
the profits accruing are to go
towards the fund that is being
raised for the building of a church
in Carencro, it is to be hoped that
success will crown their efforts.
Complaints loud and deep are!
daily uttered against what is termed
tse oppressive charges of the South
ern Pacific on freights reaching this
point. It is the people's own fault
if such a condition of affairs exist.
A railroad commission in this State,
similar to the one in Texas, would
keep this monster monopoly
within reasonable bounds. No cor
poration can oppress the people.,
only with their consent. The rem
edy is always in their hands-they
a~re sovtereign.

Carencro will repeat, at Falk's Ope
ra. House, the play which achieved
such signal success at Carencro at
its first representation. The per
formance is given to secure funds
for the erection of a Catholic church
in Carencro, and as the object is
most worthy, it is sincerely to he
hoped trhat a full aouse will greet

Carencro News.

on Monday and many souls were
made happy. The Southern Paci

later, and left their share of tue
"dollars of our daddies."
-A new cominer at the house of
D)r. J. P. Francez affords us an op
portunity of congratulating the
doctor and family. A new boy visit
or is always welcome, no matter
how small hie may be. The perpetual
smile that has wreathed the face
of the doctor for several days past,
is sufficient evidence of this.
if Carencro -is not boomning we
would like to know some proper
term to explain the wonderful in
crease of business here. Your cor
respondent has interviewed every
merchant here, and without an ex
ception they declare that they are
doing better than for years past.
-The bad weather last Saturday
prevented the races at the Carencro
track. It seems, that every time a
1 race is arranged for our track, the
weather is such as prevents the car
rying out of the programme.
-Mrs. Chas. Heichelheiin left
last Monday for a visit to old
friends in New Iberia. She will
spend most of the time with Mrs.
L. A. Veazey.

-Miss Florina Grenier, a most
agreeable and charming young lady
of Baraga, Michigan, is spending

Laforest.
-It is a sight werth seeing to
watch the number of wagons and
carts coming into town every day
loaded with cotton, cotton seed,
and sugar cane from points as re
mote as ten miles. The Teche
Railroad and Southern Pacific are
taxed to their utmost to provide
cars for sugar cane.
-The Teche Sugar Company

From Our Regular Correspondcnt.
-Mr. Haycock, and familh, of
Lafourche parish, tiring of the dis
astrous overflows visiting that sec
tion, and hearing so much of Lafa
yette parish, the garden spot of
South West Louisiana, decided to
come here, and make this parish his
future home. Accordingly : e arrived
in Royville last week, and rented
one of Mr. Roy's :ai, \\" ere . e
will cultivate tae a. . a .c. l'
tender Mr. Haycock and ifas .ly a
hearty welcome, and hope to see
many more of his friends share
their lot in this parish, where the
richest and most fertile of lands are
to be found.
-The frosts of the last few days,
have, to some extent retarded the
harvesting of corn, and the digging )
of potatoes: Mr. Octave Theriot
informed your correspondent, that 1
the ram the sweetest variety of all
potatoes yielded this fall in general,
the largest crop seen for many years.
Some of the patatoes were much1
larger then the average Queen of i
the South, a potato extensively]
raised in this parish.
-Thursday a party rushed in our
office and in an excited voice, yelled
"a safe burglarized." After seeing
that our "gun" was secreted in its
usual place, we hastened to the
scene, and found much to our
amazement, 11r. P. B. Roy, chisel
and hammer in hand, breaking and
hammering the massive doors of his
safe. The whole trouble was due
to him forgetting the keys of the
secured apartment of his coffers in
the vault of the safe, which uncessi
tated the bursting of the doors.
The damoage done amounts to about
$25 wholly covered by insurance.
-Miss Maud Young's many
friends, will be sorry to hear that
she is now ill, and confined to her
room since several days. We are
reliably informed that her illness is
nothing serious, and that in the next
few days, she will again be up and
enjoying her usual good healta.
Her cousin, and friend, Miss Efihe
Young, of Lafayette, is witia ner,
and will remain a few (lays in Roy

in town recently, with his cousins,
Dr. Scranton and family.
-Coming from Liafayette Sun
day, your correspondent noticedi
the condition of the bridge near Mr.
J. Louvierre's farm. Thiis bridge
could easily be repaired, if immne
diate attention is given to it, as at
present it is not much damaged;
but, if the heavy rains set in, and
the bridge still remains unrepaired,
it will then be but a question of
time to make it impassable.
-Amongst our Sunday visitors
to Lafayette this week, we note:
Dr. N. D. Young, Major J. O.
Blanchet, Post-Master Bonneman-a
son, Dr. Scranton and "'Cherokee."
-Messrs. Eastin and Pointboeuf

Scranton mansion Thursday. The
paintings executed by these gentle
men are very fine, especially the
*graining of doors, in imitation of
Imaple, cherry and oak, During
their short stay in our town they
*m ade several friends, who were sorry
to see them depart soon.
