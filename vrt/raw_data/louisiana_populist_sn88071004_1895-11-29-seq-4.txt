Sweden has doctors, but odoctors'
oills. If you have oceasion to call a
physicians. you will find him not only
skillful in his profession, but a highly
educated and most honorable gentle.
man. You will also have another
proof of the honesty of the Swedes,
and their triendly confidence in each
other. Swedish doctors send no bills
to their patients. What you shall pay
your physician is left entirely to your
own choice. The rich pay him liber.
ally, whether they have need of his
services or not. if he has been once
retained by them. The poor pay him
a small sum, but the very poor pay
him nothing. Yet he visits the poor
as faithfully as he does the rich. Doo
tors in this country do a great deal of
doctoring for nothing, but they al
ways expects to be paid, even when
they loose their patients.
IHonest Indian.
Bishop Whipple of Dakota, who has
done such Ia noble work among the
Sioux Indians, recently said to a re
potter: '.The Indian is proverbially
honest, unl.·ss he is demoralized by
prink. In thirty-six years' experience
rith the Indians I never knew one to
tell me a lie, and I never had a thing
stolen by one. I asked an Indian
once if it was safe to leave my prop
erty in my wigwam while I made a
distant journey. lie laughed and said:
*Quito safe. There isn't a white man
within one liundred miles of you.' "
And yet the narrow headed politician,
who gets into congress through igno
rance and fraud, says the American
Indians-the only real Americans to
be found in this country-are not fit
to vote. Honest Indian; that is so.
ili, Own Country.
A multatto named Judson owns the
town of Judson, on Johnson's Island
in the Mississippi river a little north
of Memphis, in which there is not a
single white man, the owner ruling
out the inferior race. There are in
the town six stores, a few shops, two
churches and a school. The island,
the soil of which is quite rich, iseight
miles long.

A large Expenditure.
The proposition to spend $9,000,000
on the improvement of New York's
w aterways was carried in the election,
and the canalboat will be very much
in evidence there.
Own It.
A New York syndicate practically
own the republic of San Domingo.
It takes all the taxes and pays the
salary of the president and the other
expenses of the government.
The New Senate.
The new senate will have forty-four
Republicans. thirty-seven Democrats
and eight Populists, with Delaware to
hear from. which will probably give
the Republicans one more.

PERSONAL APPEARANCE.
Girls, Do Not Neglect the Little Detallt
of Your Tolet.
"I should like to call a halt," said a
woman, "on the lack of thought and
care that most women put upon their
personal appearance. Now, I know
Very well that the average woman pays,
a great deal of attention to such things, i
but the trouble is that what attention
she does pay is of the wrong sort: it's
directed toward things that are of no
vital consequence, if not absolutely
wrong. She's like the man who had
a great deal of taste only it was all
bad. The average woman that one sees
upon the streets, in the shops and
aboard the street cars is first and fore
most rarely dainty-a cr-lminal act
where a woman is concerned. Dainti
ness, however, does not imply costly
frocks, loves of hats and lots of lace
and jewelry. It doesn't even include,
although it is undoubtedly enhanced
by the severity and simplicity t:iat are
so admirable in a tailor-made costume,
but which, as every woman knows, cost
like everything. It does imply and in
clude, however, absolute cleanliness
from top to toe,. absolute neatness and
an unswerving regard for the eternal
fitness of things. No matter how plain
or even poor the attire may be from
necessity, so far as choice goes, it may
always keep clear of pendant skirt
braids, frayed edges, run down boot
heels and spot and soil. Just look at
the army of working women that the
elevated trains bear down town daily.

whatever they be. they are, as a rule.
tricked out in finery, instead of the
sober, sensible garments suitable for
business wvar. It's fluffy white veils
and feather boas and flower and feath
er-laden hats. The very same girl, too,
whose hat is heavy with the biggest
and brightest of roses; whose once
white kid gloves are the grimiest, and
who flourishes a coarse-embroidered
handkerchief redolent of cheap perfume
is also sure to be the girl whose shoe
buttons are conspicuous for their ab
sence. whore collar is soiled, and whose
dlress skirt and shirt waist are losing
their connections. If that same girl,
however, would take a tithe of the mon
ey and care that she wastes upon her
roses, her laces and her perfumery and
put it upon repairing, cleaning, and,
above all, seeing to it that her garments
are suitable for the occasion on which
they are worn, the gain would be im
measurable. Therefore I say that it
would be better for most women if they
gave mote care and attention to theit
personal app sarance."
USED A LADDER TO GET IN BED.
Remarkable Experlence of an American
Tourist In Irelan'I.
An American who lately visited Ire
land writes: In the hotel at Dublin was
a bed so large and so high that it
seemed a tableland of mattress over
shadowed by a cliff of headboards. It
seemed preposterous that any one
should monopolize a bed of such size
and attempt to warm it. By p;roper di
vision it would have supplied a family.
When it came time to retire thre ques
tion was not how ta get "into" bed, but
how to get "on" the bed. The top mat
tress was almost chin nigh, and it
seemed that to reach it there would
have to be a hard c;1lb or a desperate
leap. While the problem of retiring
was under consideration a dark object
was seen in one dim corner of the vasty
bedroom, which was imperfectly light
ed by a solitary candle. This object
proved to be a movable stairway,
mounted on rollers. When it was
pushed against the behemoth bed the
problem of how to retire was immedi
ately solved. One had only to ascend
the stairs and then fall off into the em
bracing depth of this most remarkable
bed.
('aear's ~Statue Changes Color.
Chicago Tribune: If Augustus Caesa.
could come to life and see his statue as
it now looks, down in front of the art
institulte. that warrior surely would
'drop dead again." It and that of
Hermes are painted a bright orange.
The two statues. together with the
larlger one of Flora, have stood in a
niche over the entrance almost since
the first opening of the art institute.
But it is safe to say that not half of
the people who entered the doors ever
gave them a thought and scarcely a
glance until yesterday.
She, too. stood out in bold relief
against the smoky background of the
building yellower than any of the fall
crop of pumpkins. People who went
hurrying along the street stopped the
instant they beheld them.
"Talk about impressionism." said a
man who apparently knew something
of art. "not the most rabid piece of
work in Europe could compare with
that."
Those inside, who understood that
the bright yellow was only a priming
preparatory to.a coat of bronze, en
joyed the joke Immensely. Like the
boy with the trick on All Foos' Day,
they stood behind the glass doors and
waited to see the effect on every new
comer.

Water on Guard.
The treasurers of the Bank of
France are said to be better guarded
than those of any other bank in the
world. At the close of business
hours every day, when the money is
put into the vaults in the cellar, ma
sons at once wall up the doors with
hydraulic mortar. Water is then
turned on and kept tunning until the
cellar is flooded. A burglar would
have to have work in a diving suit
and break down a cement wall before
be could then start to loot the vaults.
When the ofllccrs arrive the next
morning the water is drawn off, the
masonry is torn down and the vaults
opened. It world be a good thing in
this country if come way could be
found to drown the preferred commis
sioners of co-operative banks before
they get away with the bank's entire
sinking fund.
Edward Atkinson recently told the
following anecdote as illustrating a
human failing very frequently to be
seen: *,When cotton seed oil was
under the bane of popular prejudice
and the law as well. a Chicago lard
mak'er shipped some lard audultera
ted' with cotton seed oil to Europe.
It was pronounced excellent lard. It
was liked so well that he received a
great order for 10,000 tierces. But
this juncture he could get no oil, and
was forced to ship the pure lard.
The consignee pronouced it 'off sam
pie.' wouldn't have it, and the unfortu
hate Chicago man lost a large sum of
money." The lard dealer was ren
dered powerless because hlie had bit
ten off more adulteration than his fac
tory could chew.

Sarsaparilla Sense.
Any sarsaparilla is sarsaparilla. True. So any
tea is tea. So any flour is flour. But grades differ.
You want the best. It's so with sarsaparilla. There
are grades. You want the best. If you understood
sarsaparilla as well as you do tea and flour it
would be easy to determine. But you don't. How
should you ?
When you are going to buy a commodity
whose value you don't know, you pick out an old
established house to trade with, and trust their
experience and reputation. Do so when buying
sarsaparilla.
Ayer's Sarsaparilla has been on the maket
fifty years. Your grandfather used Ayer's. It is a
reputable medicine. There are many sarsaparillas.
But only one Ayer's. IT CURES.
