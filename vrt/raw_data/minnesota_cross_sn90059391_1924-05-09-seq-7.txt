Recently Elected Officials of
Columbus Junction All Women
COLUMBUS JUNCTION, IA., April
f 8 new low* ide*. A town
ruled entirely by women. A woman
mayor, a woman treasurer, a woman
Assessor, a woman council.
Columbus City is a thriving city in
•outheastern lowa. It was estab
lished July 4, 1841, by a hardy group
ot pioneers who drove out the Mus
quakee. For and Sac indians and
claims now to be the first town in the
world to elect an entire personnel
of women city officials. Grandmoth
ers of the new order fashioned the
rude log cabins into homes and reared
the mothers of the new officials on
prairie bedsteads —but few of the
present generation know what e
prairie bedstead is.
“I Told Tea So”
Seasoned politicians who fought
woman suffrage tooth and nail, now
have their innings and are walking
about the streets of this lowa citv
with that air of satisfaction which
aays plainly enough, “I told you so.”
They are already thinking of how
they will like it when a woman as
sessor asks them how old they are, at
bow much they value their best horse
and how much money and credits they
are going to report.
The men of the city held their con
vention. They left their convention
ball and went down to Kern’s store
where someone suggested that a wo
man’s ticket be placed in the field. A
ticket was arranged. The women con
sented and the ticket was filed with
the city clerk. Election day came.
People flocked to the polls. ASO per
cent larger vote than the average was
recorded. The women won—in a
walkaway.
The new administration has not
outlined fully the policy it will pur
sue. The city—just as the state and
nation—is dry, but the new mayor
might be classified as somewhat damp,
fihe believes in the use of liquor for
medicinal purposes. “But we will not
tolerate bootlegging or any other
form of lawbreaking.” she declares.
“Who will clean the streets?” she
was asked by one of the disappointed
men. “I'hey will be cleaned,' r was her
prompt reply.
Who Are They l
The mayor, Miss Eva Bietz, has
taught school twelve years. She is
five feet two, has a determined chin,
a vigorous personality and a general
bearing that radiates efficiency. She
is against bobbed hair and cigarettes
for women. She asserts that she re-

PLANT TREES ALONG ROADS
Entire Stretch ef Sixty Mile* ef Paved
Highway In New Jereey t* Be
Beautified.
Beauttfylac New Jersey highways by
planting shade trees, started yean ago
la scattered districts by ladlvldual ef
fects, has been given considerable stim
ulus by Mis Indereement of the new
state highway com mission and wom
en’s organisations In different counties.
The movement, an outgrowth ef the
Werld war memorial Idea, la for utility
as well as beauty. The trees will
serve as guard rails along highways
leading to the sea.
Camden county Is given credit for
the meat ambitious scheme of tree
planting. Through the movement, orig
inated by women's clubs, the entire
stretch of 60 miles sf paved highway
from the Delaware river to the Atlan
tic es the Whits Horse pike route
Is to be beautified.
At the present time beautiful shaded
highways are to be found In sections
of Salem and Glencester counties,
where most of the trees were planted
more than fifty years ago. The plan,
at favored by the state department of
forestry, entails co-operation on the
part of communities and counties In
the systematic planting of trees.
It has been suggested that different
kinds of trees he planted os different
highways. Instead of being Identified
by numbers, the state routes eventual
ly might be known as Maple, Elm or
Spruce routes.
Cherry, apple and other fruit trees
have been planted tn double rows for
short distances os some of the roads.
This Idea has met with approval by In
dividuals, who say It carries out !u a
fashion the Italian Idea of having
grapes growing along the public waya.
Dogwood has added variety In some
rural sections; and a big land owner
has planted chestnut trees along on#
of the roads.
Road experts say shaded highways
last longer, as the trees protect the
pevement from the deterioration of In
tense heat In summer and serve as
windbreaks to keep the roads clear of
snow In winter. Drainage also is Im
proved, these men say, and the tree
roots prevent water undermining the
hard surfaced highways.—Philadelphia

LEGISLATIVE NOTES
What th« lowa Legislators Are
feeing at Special Session
For Cede Revision
leqislaure takeb recess
UNTIL JULY 22
lewa-a fourth cod* revlaioa session
•f the legislature recessed with all of
the work of revising the statute law
coasted, hills enreUed and signed
hy the officers of senate and house,
until July Stnd, when it la expected
formal action ef adoption of the new
cede may be taken.
The report of the house Judiciary
committee on Its investigation of the
conduct of her office by Mias May B.
Francis, state superintendent of pub
lic instruction, was deferred, with the
consent of the house, until the le
gislature reconvenes In July.
The end was calmly reached, the
last fight of the session hmvlng been
made on the floor of the senate when
the conference report on the prison
labor sections of tbs board of con
trol bill was finally adopted. All of
the formal work of the session was
completed before noon; but it was
necessary to stop ths clocks and re
cess until 6: SO In the afternoon In
order to receive the last two enrolled
bills.
The last day’s work of the special
session included the passage ot the
ooncurreat ersolutlon fixing the time
of reconvening as 11 o’clock Tuesday
morning, July 2S; passage of a joint
resolution authorizing the cancella
tion by the board of control of con
tracts for labor of prisoners and le
galizing new contracts from July 1,
1924 to July 1, 1927; defeat of the
Brookins resolution requesting a re
cess investigation of prison labor em
ployment; passage of a resolution of
appreciation of the work of Code Com
missioners U. G. Whitney, J. H. Tre
win and J. C. Mabry; and passage of
a resolution deferring the report of
the Francis investigating committee
until the legislature reconvenes in
July.
Those who have given close atten
tion to the work of the codifiers are
satisfied that accurate and painstak
ing work has been done. The work
of codifying was done by a commis
sion of three lawyers. This work has
now been read, debated and ratified
by the general assembly. The law
makers assert that nothing has es
caped their attention and that when
the code Is completed It will repre
sent what the people have wanted lr
the way of. laws. It will be several
months before the code is ready for
public use. The printing will be
much more promptly done than It was
la 1197, for the reason that type set
ting la now done hy rapid machines.
It Is stated that the special code ses
sion of the legislature will cost the
state mere than $300,000. The state
ef lowa baa been passing laws for
sevanty-eight years. To keep all of
these laws In order, for ready refer
ence and to avoid conflict, la a tedious
and oostly process.
Teachers of lowa who have had
threa or more years of successful
teaching experience are not to be af
fected by retroactive certification
rules Issued by the superintendent of
public Instruction or the state board
of examiners, under the terms of a
joint resolution voted out by the Ju
diciary committee, which has been In
vestigating the official acts of Miss
May E. Francis, superintendent of
public Instruction. Likewise, the res
olution will protect schools of the
state in their accredited standing
against teacher qualification rulings
that might take them off the accredit
ed list by the disbarment of experi
enced teachers and state aid may not
be denied accredited achools under
such conditions. The resolution was
framed by the committee prior to the
opening of the Francis Investigation
but the Inquiry was responsible in
pert for its Introduction in the houee.
Governor Kendall has officially an
nounced that Fred L. Maytag of New
ton would be appointed director of
the budget under the tew recently
passed by the lowa legislature. His
statement said! *1 had some deli
cacy (n announcing his appointment
before the bill was signed, but I am
thoroughly acquainted with the pro
visions of the measure passed by
the general assembly, and It will have
my sanction. The state is fortunate
In that I was able to induce Senator
Maytag te undertake the organization
of the work. The question of hfa sal
ary waa not mentioned by him or by
me la the discussion of the subject.
I presented the matter to him as offer
ing a high opportunity to render the
state a vital service, and he accepted
the position In that same lofty spirit.
The amendment to the pools and
trust bill authorizing the state execu
tive oounctl to sell gasoline, coal and
fuel oil whenever it was to the inter
est to the people, went to Its death
In the lower house of the legislature
by a vote of 70 to 8.
The work of the legislature receiv
ed the praise of Lieutenant Governor
John Hammlll In a statement laauod.
Hamm 111 declared the accomplishment
ef the legislatures will long be remem
bered.
Under the Board of Control bill at

labor la adequate, compered with
prices paid for labor la like Indus

Although forty of the forty-eight
states in the union have some form of
budget legislation. lowa, is a pioneer
in progressive budgetary regulation,
▲t present an overwhelming number
of states which employ the budget
system merely require the various ex
pending bodies to file with the gover
nor a detailed report showing the es
timate amount of expenditures and all
sources of Income, a survey of the
budget laws shows. From these re
ports the governors, in the case of
twenty-ene states, compile their state’s
budgets and recommends passage to
the houses of the state legislatures.
Before the enactment of the budget
law by the state legislature lowa was
in the class which forms its budget
on the governor’s recommendation.
Because of its departure from ordin
ary budgetary systems, lowa will be
closely watched during the next few
years by every state in the union and
its is wholly probable that upon this
state’s success or failure to apply its
budget plan, will hinge changes in
legislation along this line in other
states.
The prison labor controversy which
has been waged throughout this spe
cial session was ended la the senate
with the adoption of the second con
ference report on the board of oen
trol bill. The houee has alas adapt
ed the report. This bill embmees ene
flfth of the sections revised at the
special session. The report gives the
board of control final authority in
making contracts for the labor of pris
oners with private concerns, subject
to the approval, on appeal, of the spe
cial appeal board created in the bud
get law. The oontraets, under the
report and the bill, may be made for
three years, at which time private
contracts will be replaced by the state
use system.
The code supervising committee, au
thorized in the law prescribing me
thods of preparation and publication
of the new code, was named by Pres
ident Hammill of the senate and
Speaker Anderson of the house. Mem
bers of the committee are Senators
Dutcher of Johnson and Smith of Ma
dison, and Representatives Clark of
Linn, Harrison of Pottawattamie, and
Doolittle of Delaware. This legisla
tive committee will work with Code
Editor U. O. Whitney, O. K. Patton
and their code revising staff from
the recess of the legislature until the
code is printed, bound and ready for
distribution.
Senators who are retiring this year
include many senate leaders. The
seventeen senators not candidates for
reelection are: Senators Abben of
Lyon, Adams of Kossuth, Banta of
Delaware, Dutcher of Johnson, Ethell
of Davis, Hale of Jones, Holdoegel of
Calhoun, Johnston of Lucas. New
berry of Clayton, Olson of Boone,
Price of Monore, Scott of Marshall,
Slosson of Worth, Smith of Madison,
Thurston of Clark, Tuck of Taylor
and Wichman of Hancock.
On the house side thirty-seven rep
resentatives will retire. Of the sev
enty-one candidates for re-election
fourteen have no opposition in eihter
party. Twenty-two will have no op
position In the primary election; but
each will have an opponent in No
vember. There are two new candi
dates for representative wbo are the
only ones to file in their district.
Northern lowa seems especially well
satisfied with Its representatives as
seven have no opposition.
Lieut. Gov. John Hamnsill, retiring
president of the state Senate, in spite
of long-established custom, failed to
get the chair which he occupied dur
ing the 40th General Assembly.
Solons feared that taxpayers would
not consider the gift in line with the
economy program carried out by the
special session. Retiring legislators
failed to avail themselves of the cus
tom which permits them to buy their
chairs for $lO and shipping charges.
Governor Kendall has vetoed no
hills passed by the special session and
is not expected to veto any. There
is virtually no deubt he will sign the
board of control bill, which organis
ed labor leaders asked him to veto.
This bill comprises one-third of the
sections revised and Interlocks with
eight or ten other bills, and its veto
would require the legislature to re
assemble, It was stated at the cap!-
tol.
Departing members of the legisla
ture exchanged geod wishes and those
whose terms expire were offered as
sistance in their campaigns by bold
over members and others who have
no opposition for reelection. The
members of this special session have
beoome especially well acquainted be
cause they have all sat with each
other through two sessions and some
lave been colleagues in three sessions.
Governor Kendall undoubtedly will
sign the prison labor bill, over which
there was much controversy during
the special session of the legislature
had asked Governor Kendal lto veto
the bill because they could net agree
with its provisions relative te com
petition by prison workers with free
labor.
The budget bill will oorrect many
of the evils of unjuest assessments.
It will put the operation of a oounty
and state business on a plan similar
in conduct to any private enterprise.
There will be many new faces in
both the senate and the house of the
forty-lrst lowa general assembly
when It convenes next January
Present alignments in both houses
will be somewhat different In the next
sessions of the legislature. The house
farm bloc will lose but thirteen mem
bers. Seven of them are candidates
for election to the senate. The con
servative faction In the senate is los
ing more member* than the progres
sive group; hut the prospects are that
when the nevt scn*ts la organised it
will have gathered enough reinforce
menta to hold Its own again.

Evidence.
Washington.—Gaston B. Means, the
International Investigator whom Wil
liam J. Burns prabwd as the "greatest
detective la the world," frankly ad
mitted to the Brookhart committee
that he had been duped.
Fake officers, carrying a letter bear
ing the forged signature of Senator
Brookhart, called on Mr. Means and
calmly certod away the volumes of
written evidence which was to to have
been the food and drink of the com
mittee for another two weeks.
Twenty-three-Vetwme Diary.
It was this ssaea of papers whiffc
was to havo substantiated the mass of
verbal testimony which Means had of
fered at Intervals since midwinter. In
cluded In the missing record was the
28-volume dinry of lir. Means himself.
Somewhere on the pages of tbesa mys
terious books was the story of how
Means hau "gotten the low down"
on Secretary Mellon.
Members of the committee reluc
tantly confessed when they heard the
news of the disappearance that the
backbone of the Means testimony had
been fractured, If not complexly
broken.
The documents v ere spirited sway
several days ago. The fact that there
was something wrong about the trans
action developed when the clerk of the
Brookhart committee reminded Mr.
Means t* bring his record-" with him
when he made his appearance before
the committee.
Disappeared Several Days Ago.
"I turned tbeee records over on your
order of March 81 —the committee has
all the records,” Means told O. H.
Rankin, tike committee's clerk.
Means went home. In half an hour
he returned with the letter itself. It
read:
"You are hereby commanded to de
liver to the senate committee on in
vestigation of the Deportment of Jus
tice all jour records, flies, diaries, re
ports, copies of reports, and all papers
In your in connection with
the Department of Justice, te be Im

H. Morse, seems to provide that 001.
Morse shall pay the federal and state

amount to $600,000 more than the leg

“If Crime Is Disease, Men Should
Net Be Punished for It”
Is Charge
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 6—ln
discussing the abolition of capital
punishment in Canada, some interest
ing information was given the house
of commons. The labor member
from Calgary said:
“If crime were in the nature of
disease, as modern criminologists
aver, they put themselves in the ri
diculous situation of punishing a man
for disease. If crimes are fewer to
day than they were in the eighteenth
century, it is because intellectually,
morally and economically the race
has outgrown them; they were not
stamped out by the death penalty.”
Oregon, Nebraska and Maine have
gone on record through their attor
neys general as stating that capital
punishment is no deterrent.
In Melbourne, Australia, a demon
stration was recently held against
capital punishment. Thousands of
signatures are reported to a petition
to the cabinet, for its abolition.
New York state is endeavoring to
abolish the chair. Many states in tho
south are amending and changing
their penal laws, North Carolina be
ing the most recent to plan reforms
in prisons. It had a "Committee of
One Hundred” formed from citizen
ranks, which has put forth a program
calling for the institution of district
jails to supplant the present county
system, separate colonies for wom
en prisoners, the abolition of flogging
and dark cells at county camps, aboli
tion of the lease system, the honor
system for all prisoners, the establish
ment of industries at the state’s pris
on, compulsory education among
prisoners, and the employment of
teachers.
Public sentiment is cryst alii zing
away from the Mosaic law of an eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,
an i towards the conviction that, in
a very real sense, men are indeed
their brothers’ keepers.
AMERICANS WIN ELECTION
JOPLIN, MO.—Americanism won ft
signal victory at the polls in the mu
nicipal election held here recently.
The casting of ballots was preceded
by a deluge of advertisements sent
out by the anti-klan forces, which
not only contained many misleading
statements, but were in some instanc
es downright falsehoods.
GRAVE CITY, PA.—Klansmen of
Grave City made their first public ap
pearance here last week, when they
met in the I. O. O. F. hall and
marched in a body to the Grace Meth
odist Episcopal church for the eve
ning service. Approximately 800 men
and women members were in the
body.
