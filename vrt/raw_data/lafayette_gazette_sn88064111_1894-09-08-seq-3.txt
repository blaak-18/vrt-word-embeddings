-The following, taken from the cry
report submitted by R. G. Dun & fn
Co's. Mercantile Agency, will prove so
interesting to our merchants and but
farmers: oul
"Lafayette Parish-Condition of to
trade: we
There is considerable improve- lan
ment in trade; less credit and more
cash sales. Our Washington friends ha
having gone to their homes, it is to as
be hoped they will now occupy their be
time with their own private affairs;
it they do so trade will improve un
questionably. Conditions are fair be
and prospects good; the crops have gr,
been made cheaply, and there will
be more money in circulation soon. the
Crop Conditions: There has at
been a reduction an cotton acreage to
and a corresponding increase in ex
cane cultivation. The bounty made gr
cane cultivation possible here, and Al
its withdrawal will send our planters
back to cotton. The sugar industry of
is demoralized. The cotton crop so
is fine, a little too much rain, and pl
the crop about too weeks late.
Corn crop very good.
Notes.-In and around Carencro pr
there has been a marked advance
in real estate values, as much as 5o ct

gar Company, has built a sugar- O
house, several cotton gins have
