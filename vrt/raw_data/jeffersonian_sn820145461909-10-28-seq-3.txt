THE FATTED CALF
A Story of His Slaying and of the Prodigal’s Return
Grace MacGowan
I.
OURKE began it when we were
at school. Bourke is my
brother, three years younger,
slim and wiry as an Indian—
B
■ !
and something of that jealous com
plexion. I used to beat him in the
class-room, while he beat me on the
campus; and when I was finally found
to be a fair center rush, largely on
account of my weight, Bourke nick
named me the Fatted Calf —and the
name stuck.
I know now, and I knew then, that
it stuck because I hated it. Folks in
this world love to see other people
writhe —especially when other peo
ple are fat. There is something lu
dicrous, and nothing touching, in the
anguish of the obese.
My brother Bourke is good to look
at, and as fickle as the wind; he has
been engaged in the breaking of fe
male hearts since he was in pinafores
—a pursuit at which I never strove
to excel him. Therefore it was not a
great surprise to me when I came
upon him and Kate Heath, our next
door neighbor, spooning on the lawn
between the two places, and they an
nounced to me in one breath that
they were engaged.
“Again?” I asked brutally. “That
makes three times this year doesn’t
it?”
“It’s only two for me,” pouted
Katharine; “and I don’t know wheth
er I will be engaged to Bourke, after
all. He says he’s going to South
America, and if he starts next, week,
so that he can’t be up in the moun
tains, I don’t see the use!” Bourke
and I were shouting at her naive
admission, and she looked at us re
proachfully. “I didn’t say two at
one time,” she explained with some
asperity.
Bourke quieted down and looked
anxious.
“Oh, come, Katharine, you’re not
going to call the thing off for such a
silly reason as that,” be urged. “I’ll
be back from Buenos Ayres in less
than six months —and think of the
letters!”
“I do think of the letters —horrid
bores!” his fiancee retorted ungrate
fully. “What I want is somebody up
at Skyland to be nice to me. There’s
a honeymooning couple in the crowd,
and two pairs of engaged wretches.
No” —with sudden resolution —“if
you’re going to South America it’s
off!”
“See here, Charlie,” said my broth
er, turning to me, as he always did
in a tight place; “you’re going to be
up at Skyland—what’s the matter
with you? One Langdon and another
Langdon are pretty much the same
thing—with the addition of a few
pounds.”
If he had spared me this last gibe,
1 might have agreed at once. As it
was, I said grimly;
“It is, when you happen to be
‘one Langdon;’ but if, as in my case,
you chance to be ‘another Langdon’—
that makes all the difference;”
I had loved Katharine Heath, pa
tiently adored her, as many years as
I had known her. When she and
Bourke were in the kindergarten to
gether, I, in the primary, used to be
commissioned to take them to the
seat of learning. I think I men
tioned that Bourke was breaking fe
male hearts at that early age; he
broke Katharine’s on an average
about once a week —and I had to
mend it as best I could in my clumsy,
older-boy fashioned way. Os course
she never noticed my devotion, then,
or later. Who attends to what a
fatted calf does? Haven’t we always
heard of calf love?
To be a sort of fiance emeritus to
Katharine Heath-—the situation
promised some happiness, and a
great deal of anguish. The latter I
was used to; I had chummed with
sorrow from the first in this my one
love affair, and I dreaded it not at all;
but I was afraid the happiness might
hurt. Yet, of course, when I saw
tears in Katharine’s eyes, I took
the old position of mender of breaks,
patcher-up of torn places, and weak
ly agreed to all that those two mad
caps proposed.
11.
We had been a week at Skyland.
I found the sweet decidedly outweigh
ing the bitter in my engagement.
Katharine had told me that her
grandmother—heaven bless the old
lady, and reward her with lengthened
days for her good judgment!—said
she was relieved to see that her
granddaughter had shown some
k ,sense, and had taken me instead of
my frivolous brother. Indeed, Kate
showed a disposition to burn an al
most more than legitimate amount of
incense to my vanity, and my vanity
wasn’t used to it. I was afraid some
times, that I should forget exactly
k who I was, and how placed, those
potent fumes so intoxicated me.
We were lounging home from the
links one afternoon, Katharine with
her sleeves still rolled to the elbow,
her cheeks pink from the exercise.
We sought a quiet knoll, and sat
where we were in sight of the hotel,
with its cottages on the one hand
and the shirt-waisted or scarlet-coat
ed players on the other.
“You make an absolutely perfect
fiance—in public,” Katharine began
abruptly, without looking at me.
I took from her hand the golf club
with which she was digging in the
sod.
“That thing is not a hoe,” I said
reprovingly, with the single intention
of destroying her employment so that
she might be more likely to look at
me when she spoke. “You know I’m
only half a fiance,” I went on, “and
if I’m filling half the position well,
what more can you expect?”
“What, indeed—from some men?”
Katharine retorted, and she looked
at me now oddly enough.
“Katharine,” I said in my most
elder-brotherly manner, “I find my
self quite enjoying the arrangement.
I have looked on at the other fellow’s
mistakes—and I’m growing gray at
the business. It always seemed to
me that they filled the part rather
clumsily. I’ve believed for years that
'Seffcrsonlan
I could do much better. I’ve actual
ly been keeping up with the fancies
of the modern young woman in the
•’way of sweets and flowers, and such
small attentions, with the idle no
tion of what an ideal fiance I should
be able to make. But of course I
don’t need to remind you that I am,
as it were, on half pay. I trust I do
the thing, as you so generously admit,
up to the nines in public; that’s what
I was hired for, I believe. In pri
vate,” I went on severely, “you would
look for no change in my demeanor.
You would reprehend anything of that
sort, and be the first to reprove it, I
am sure.”
Her face was turned away, but I
was certain she was blushing; and
she answered in a small, muffled voice
that might have been shaken by
either tears or laughter:
“Oh, certainly!”
Somehow, I felt pleased at the state
of things. I gucked a sense of power
from the atmosphere of it.’
“Come,” I said, rising and offering
my >hand, “let’s go and sit in the
pagoda, or josshouse, or whatever
they call that absurd thing over there
on the lawn. The sun is too warm
for you here.” She rose obediently,
and walked beside me. I really be
lieve I was getting somewhere, mak
ing some point, though Heaven knows
it seemed unlikely. “And then, my
dear Katharine,” I returned to the
charge in a rather patronizing tone,
“you must consider me in this matter.
I am aware that nobody ever does;
but pray let me suggest that you
should, for a moment only. I delight,
I positively revel, in showing the de
votion of a fiance in public. But I
should not wish, by my demeanor
when we are alone together, to cheap
en that sentiment which I hold sacred
to—which I hold sacred -”
“Oh!” cried Kate, pausing abrupt
ly in the door of the little summer
house, and drawing back with wide,
startled eyes. “Another girl!”
“An ideal,” I returned loftily.
“How interesting,” she murmured,
as we settled ourselves comfortably.
I suspected latent irony in her tone;
but she looked up very sweetly, and
went on: “So you’ve got an ideal,
you dear old Carl!” Everybody else
calls me Charlie, which is absurd for
a big man. “Please tell me all about
her! ”
Then I launched forth upon what I
conceived to be the greatest piece of
diplomacy of my life. The chances
were even that Bourke would hold to
this engagement, fickle as he was—
who could ever weary of Katharine?
Well, then, I would have her for a
sister-in-law; and in that case, what
more desirable than that my foolish
infatuation should be buried, and hid
den, and forgotten?
I looked at the dear girl before me,
who had always appeared to me the
most lovable and desirable creature
on earth, and I described to her an
ideal which was pretty near her oppo
site in every point I mentioned. I
don’t, as a usual thing, like inflicting
pain, even when it is merely wound
