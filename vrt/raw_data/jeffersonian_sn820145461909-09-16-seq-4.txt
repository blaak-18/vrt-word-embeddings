Summary of Events
Controversy over the North Pole
has been absorbing the world’s in-

that he had reached the pole, came
that of Lieut. Peary, to the effect
that he had attained the goal of his
desire and congratulations seemed
in order for both. It is fine to be
first, of course, to win in such an un
dertaking, nevertheless the dangers
and hardships would be under any
present means of getting to the pole
as great for the hundredth as for the
first, and the world was prepared to
congratulate both men in equal
measure. Then there developed on
Peary’s part a spirit of bitterness
and criminations and recriminations
as to violation of “polar ethics” have
been made by the Lieutenant and
bis partisans and by the partisans of
Cook. The latter has so far re
trained from showing an ugly spirit,
which will add much to his laurels
if he is sincere, while Peary’s accu
sations, even if true, seem to have
come with unnecessary suddenness
and violence. Meantime, both men
are coming home, at which time
they will display their proofs before
those competent to judge their gen
uineness. Peary has been “dashing”
to the pole for the past twenty years,
and if he finally touched it, well and
good; but he doesn’t quite own the
spot, nor have any patent upon it, or
copyright to it, so if Dr. Cook got
there, too, or even preceded him,
here’s hoping the latter gentleman
will be able to prove it.
Almost simultaneously with the
announcement that the strike at Mc-

stantial, if not a complete victory,
comes the announcement that the
Federal investigation into conditions
at the plant has been abandoned.
The connection is very suggestive.
But if the Government has no juris
diction in the . matter, the State
should investigate, and punish Hoff
stot and his fellow-conspirators, for
their flagrant violations of law, de
cency and the common dictates of
justice. It is very possible that
Pennsylvania has laws against all of
fenses committed, and that it is but
necessary to enforce these in order
that justice may be done, although
peonage is a Federal offense, and it
is strange that the Federal Courts
should be so chary about taking hold
in such a case, when they are but too
eager to exercise jurisdiction when a
corporation is to be favored, instead
of punished.
Be that as it may, it is very sig
nificant that with the threat of a
probe, the company suddenly found
that it did have something to arbi
trate, after all, and did so in double
quick time.

tribesmen only at ‘_‘a cost that will
stagger humanity”. A detachment
of 11,0 00 soldiers has been set out for
Morocco, and troops have been mo
bilized with considerable dispatch to
meet the grave emergency. There is
little doubt but that, if quiet can be
maintained at home, the people be
ing cowed into submissiveness, and
enough soldiers thrown into the re
gion about Melilla, the victory will
eventually go to Spanish arms as
against the ancient foe, with his an
tiquated, though still tolerably ef
fective, methods of fighting. That
is, the victory will apparently re
dound to Spain, but in reality it will
be a triumph for the private interests
which sit safely at home while the
Moors are divested of their rights by

overwhelming numbers, and Spanish
soldiers meet death and torture as
the fortune of war may elect.
The details of some of the inci
dents of this war are almost too hor
rifying for print. The barbarous
tribesmen put such prisoners-as they
capture to fearful tortures, prefera
bly before the. eyes of their com
rades.. In all probability the Span
iards are retaliating on such Moors
as they nab. By goading each other
to frenzy, however, the fat stay-at
