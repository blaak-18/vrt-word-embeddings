A GREAT MISFORTUNE.
The destruction of the Catholic
church at Carencro on the night of
- March 28, can only be regarded in
*'Lthe light of a calamity. It will
prove a check to enterprise and de
-termination, a blow to a people
that have sacrificed much and who
have worked with a will that is sel
dom seen anywhere. Their means
and their time were limited, but
they gave freely of both that their
town might be in the lead, and that
they might possess a temple of a
worship that many places of greater c
pretentions could well be proud of. a
But, if it was a blow to them, what tl
was it to their leader, to their good
pastor, who has striven in every ii
way to help them in their purpose- la
whose very soul seemed wrapped cd
up in this work. There are few in- di
deed, who do not feel deeply im- tc
pressed, and full of sympathy for
Father Laforest. They realize their L
great loss, but fully understood how d,
much more it must effect the good ei
priest who sees his ambition shat- m
tered, and his glorious work a fail- lid
ure. ne
Words are inadequate to express pi
the loss that it really is to Carencro. cl
The Gazette hastens to offer its
sincere sympathy to the people of pc
Carencro and particularly to Father sig
Laforest in the great misfortune Lc
which just befell them in the de- loi
struction of their new church jbuild- ol
ing. Father Laforest has ceitainly «et
worked faithfully to give his people thi
a place of worship of which they ha
could well have been proud. Al- Th
though not yet completed, it was tin
one'.of the most handsome struc- of
tures of its kind to be found in the all
State, and was the result of years of dis
labor on the part of Father La- bei
forest, liberally assisted by the the
citizens of Carencro. Seldom has qu
a minister displayed as much devo- ant
tion in behalf of his congregation, sin
and it Is due principally to his en- 1
ergy and perseverance that the opi
building was on the eve of being up(
completed. From what The Ga- brc
zette has been able to ascertain, ant
very little of the lumber can be tru
utilized and the loss is a very heavy diff
one as nearly $9ooo had been ex- tioi
pended in the construction of the to
building. Such a sudden and terri- whi
ble calam;ty is exceedingly dis- the
heartening, but The Gazette be- this
believes that the plucky little town, 1
lead by the courageous priest, will clet
renew its efforts with increased stru
vigor and determination. beg
Though now only a mass of de- whi
bris, the magnificent edifice, as it de
stood before the storm, will always star
be referred to as a monument to and
Father Laforest's zeal and energy. will

TIIE CONSTITUTIONAL I1
CONVENTjON. equ.
Tensas Gazette.
con
In January of next year the voters trol
of this State will determine by their the
suffrages whether or not a consti- tion
tutional convention should be held
the following month. telli
While the present constitution prot
needs a general overhauling, many poss
of its provisions having been corr
framed to meet conditions which hor
no longer exist, it is perfectly well p
anderstood that the main purpose once
of the call is the reform of the rifice
present suffrage system. can
If there could have been in the Sout
minds of the intelligent and pa- andr
triotic citizens of this State any lieve
doubt about the expediency or ne- race
cessity of a radical change from pren
the present system, the recet and
tourse of political events should set ab
such doubts at rest. elect
"'The Solid South" was brought r898
about and maintained by the force peop
-of two conditions only. Imme- co
diately after the war the bitterness vote
engendered by that struggle was stite
-sufcient in itself to bind the South- Loui
eon States in political brotherhood. quarl
i*rThat feeling, if it exists at all an
Mw, does so to a very trifling ex- those
I'4and is wholly iuiflicient to those
shape or eontr.ol-thT political policy,
of the Southern States in the future.
DDA The -horrors of the reconstruction
period and the fear of negro domi
rOR. nation have, however, for the past
twenty years subordinated all other
RISH* political propositions and rendered
it absolutely necessary that the
Second white people of the South should,
putting all other political or eco
nomical questions aside, remain
closely united.
With the flight of twenty years,
embracing a long period of freedom
holic from negro domination, a new gen
ht of eration of voters has come into ex
ld in istence. To most of these that aw
will ful period ending in z876 is a mat
d de- ter of tradition, many of them were
eople never brought face to face with the
who shameful era, and to them it is a
sel- mere matter of history, a sad, hu
eans miliating page in the annals of the
but South.
their There is another class, not in
that considerable in number, who while
of actually participating in the politi
:ater cal events of the z868-z876 period
of. and with whom the recollection of
what those dark days is yet fresh, have
good permitted themselves to be lulled
very into a sense of security by the mere
e- lapse of time, and in the absence of
)ped careful analysis of the present con
in- ditions, believe "negro domination"
im- to be impossible in the future.
for We believe it impossible for a
heir Louisianan, who loves his State and
how desires its wefare, to fall into graver
rood eiror, or one which more surely
hat- menaces the entire social and po
fail- litical fabric than that of believing
negro domination impossible or im
ress probable under the existing fran
"ro. chise regulations.
its It is manifest to the most casual
of political observer that the Cauca
her sians of the Southern States, and
une Louisiana especially, can no G
de- longer be held together upon the
ild- old lines. The disintegration of
inly "the Solid South" has begun, and
pie the old lines are being slowly, per
hey haps, but most surely obliterated. V
Al- The tariff question alone would, in t
was time, have worked the destruction
uc- of the Solid South, and broken up
the all old party affi:iations and party
of discipline; and it must be remem
La- bered that there has arisen within
the the past year or two a financial
has question, which for intensity and
vo- and earnestness has no parallel
:n, since the discussion of slavery.
en- Men of all shades of political
the opinion differ, and differ widely,
ing upon this question. They have
a- broken loose from the old moorings
in, and formed new alliances. This Bi
be fruitful source of discord added to
vY differences upon economic ques
=X- tions points with unerring centainty L
he to a further weakening of the bonds
ri- which have held the white men of
is- the South together for more than
)e- thirty years.
rn, With the whites divided it is as
'ill clear as the noon-day sun that the
ed struggle for the negro vote must
begin, and the political faction
e- which secures It will control the
it destinies of the State. D
The negro will at once under
ys stand his importance; will demand
to and will receive recognition and
. will dominate and control the or
ganization with which he is allied.
In Louisiana the races are nearly
equally divided. It is within the
power of a very few white men to G
control the negro vote, and con
rs trolling it they will either control
ir the State or there will be revolu
i- tion, bloodshed and death.
d It is within the power of the in
telligent people of this State,
through constitutional means, to At
n protect themselves against the
y possibility of a return to misrule, T
nf corruption, and all the attendant We
horrors of the reconstruction auc
I period. They can accomplish, by ma
lawful and peaceful methods, what
e once was brought about at a sac
e rifice of life and property. We
can now do what Mississippi and
South Carolina have already done.
and we hold it to be the solemn and
Lsacred duty of every man who be- HI
y lieves in the fitness of the white
-race to govern, who desires its su
, premacy and who loves good order
and good government, to put forth
every effist and energy to bring
t about- an affirmative result of the
election to be held in January,
t 1898, taking the sense of our
people on the proposition to hold a C
constitutional convention.
The ignorant aei the vicious
Svoter must be·iliminated by con
s stitutional an jawful means, else
Louisiana must go back ward a
quarter of a century in her progress
and her prosperity.
We owe this to ourselves, to
-those who have gone before and to
Sthose who are t come atipft us.
