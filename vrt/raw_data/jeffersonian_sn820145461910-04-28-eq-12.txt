The cash prize contest, which end
ed on April 15th, was one of the
closest we have ever had. The grand
prize was won by Mr. John L. G.
Woods, of Monticello ,Ga., by a scant
margin of three subscriptions. It
takes a lot of continuous hustling to
beat an agent like Mr. S. J. Cowan,
of Swainsboro, Ga., and Mr. Woods
deserves the heartiest congratulations
on the steady perseverance which
won him his success.
The monthly prizes were distrib
uted as follows:
First Prize: John L. G. Woods,
Monticello, Ga.
Second Prize: S. J Cowan, Swains

OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
MAMMA IS A WATSON MAN.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am fourteen
years old and small for my age. I
am papa and mamma’s oldest boy.
Papa wanted to name me Thomas
Watson, but mamma was not much
of a Watson “man” then, and ob
jected. They compromised by nam
ing me Eugene Watson Barwick.
Mamma is a strong Watson “man”
now. I hope to send you some more
subscribers soon.—Your little friend,
E. Watson Barwick, Thomasville, Ga.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I enjoy reading
the letters from the little boys and
girls very much. I think every boy
and girl ought to go to school. I like
the riddles very much, but I think
the Bible questions will do us more
good than the riddles. Don’t you,
Daddy Jim? I will answer Almond
Moore’s riddle: David killed the
giant with a rock. I think the an
swer to Georgia Keller’s riddle is a
gray watermelon. I will ask a few:
(1) What is it that a man has got,
but he doesn’t want it, and yet he
wouldn’t take the world for it? (2)
How old was David when all Israel
came to anoint him King? As I fear
my letter will end up in Daddy Jim’s
waste basket, I will close with much
love to the Post-Card Club. —Annie
Lee Butler, Lilly, Ga., R. F. D. 1.
(One of your riddles was left out
because it had already been pub
lished.—Daddy Jim.)
A LITTLE GEORGIA GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little girl from Madison county, in
the dear old State of Georgia. Papa
takes The Jeffersonian, and I like to
read it very much. I go to school,
and am in the sixth grade. Mr. L. W.
Potts is our teacher, and I like him
fine. This is my first attempt to
write to you, and hope it will escape

TWO CONUNDRUMS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
thirteen-year-old Georgia boy. My
papa takes The Jeffersonian, and I
like to read it very much. I think
Mr. Watson is a great man. Now, I
will ask two riddles: (1) Why is a
young girl coming down the street
like a ship coming into harbor? (2)
What is the difference between a
sewing machine and a kiss? I will
close, as this is my first time. *With
best wishes to Daddy Jim and cous
ins, your friend, Amos Adams, Dewy
Rose, Ga.
LIKES FARM LIFE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come for!
the first time. I live in the country
on a farm. I do like farm like. I
had rather live in the country than
in a town. Our school was out on
the twenty-fifth of March. I will
have to go to work now. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and I enjoy read
ing it very much. I will answer
Thomas H. Griffin’s riddle: It is a
watch. I will ask one: Thousands
of eyes and never a nose? If I see
this in print, I will try again.—Ver-
non Sturkey, Leverett, Ga.
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.
Dear Daddy Jim:—As I have not
seen any more letters from South
Carolina, I will write again. Hope
this will escape the waste basket. I
