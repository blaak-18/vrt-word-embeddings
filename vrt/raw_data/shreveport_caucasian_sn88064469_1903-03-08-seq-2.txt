[Special Correspondence.]
Washington, March 2. - President
Roosevelt attended the recent wedding
of the daughter of Senator Cockrell of
Missouri, which was an unusually bril
liant and enjoyable affair. Among the
guests was Hon. John W. Foster, the
well known American diplomat and
former secretary of state, whom the
president has selected to look after the
interests of the
iUnited States in
the negotiations
under the lately
ratified Hay
Herbert Alaskan
treaty.
The president
f was in particu
larly fine fettle
and had more
fun than a
schoolboy on a
lark. He ram
bled around
among the guests
at the breakfast,
told the girls
how pretty they
were, shook
hands with and
complimented
the matrons and
doubtless would
have kissed the
babies had there
been any pres
ent. Despite all
THE SALAD SLID OFF h i s merriment
THE PLATE. the president
was inadvertently the cause of a palpa
ble disaster.
During the serving of the wedding
breakfast Mrs. Foster asked her hus
band to get her some salad. Mr. Fos
ter went to the table and procured a
plate of salad and a cup of clam bouil
ilon. Just as he was about to hand the
salad to Mrs. Foster the president
came up and asked the diplomat some
question about the Alaskan boundary.
Mr. Foster very justly prides himself
on his knowledge of the conditions and
status of Alaska and began an earnest
dissertation on that subject, giving
emphasis by rather animated gesticu
lations. The result was that the salad
slid gracefully off the plate and landed
full on the front breadth of Mrs. Fos
ter's magnificent dress.
The discussion of the Alaskan bound
ary question came to an abrupt end,
Mr. Foster having more serioug things
to engross his immediate attention.
'Representative Hamilton of Michi
gan had for his guest the other day
Tax Commissioner Mc
s Laughlin of the Wol
verene State.
"I suppose you will
Prero.tive take me to the White
- - House," asked Mr. Mc
McLaughlin. Mr. Hadhilton affected
great surprise that such a request
should be 4nade of him.
"Good heavens, no!" he said. "I can't
do that."
"But why?" asked McLaughlin. "I
am usually taken there when I come
to Washington."
"Yes, yes, I know," Hamilton an
swered. "but, you see, I am the Michi
gan member of the Congressional
union."
"I don't understand," faltered Mc
Laughlin.
"Well, I'll tell you. If I took you to
the White House I would be fired out
of the union, for we recognize that
William Alden Smith of Grand Rapids
has the exclusive prerogative of taking
Michigan men to see the president."
Since President Roosevelt's "race
suicide" letter deploring the lack of
children in American families was
printed he has been overwhelmed with
letters of congratulation from all over
the country. The most convincing ex
hibit came from Bucyrus, 0., in the
shape of a photograph. It showed a
sturdy man and his equally sturdy
wife surrounded by twelve children, all
theirs. Beneath the picture was writ
ten the simple legend:
"Not guilty."
Representative Fordney of Michigan,
who enjoys the reputation of being a
wit, was the other day arguing earnest
ly in behalf of American registry for
the good ship Mira, which has been
smashed on the rocks off the coast of
Nova Scotia. There was opposition on
the part of some of his colleagues, and
that mn..A- MLr. Fordney even more ear
nest in ais algument. He reached a
,-everish comparison as to the objec
tions raised and the benefits that would
accrue.
"Why, Mr. Speaker," said he, "the
objections raised here to the passage of
this bill don't amount to a fly track on
the map of the world."
A laugh went around the mahogany
desks, and Mr. Fordney's bill passed
with a whoop.
Eveh the man with the "political
pull" has his woes, as indicated by the
story told by a dejected
la't Lle Iowa politician to a
group of correspond
"This politics game is
not what t's cracked up to be," he said.
;-,listen to tme. There was a young
P 4n eu7 state who went to the
S . .. ,-- -- - - .,. -
of his oul..1. back in the home town
in Iowa wr~t;e to me and asked me to
get to work. I hustled around and got
him a job as consul-got it by n:y own
efforts and through my own pull.
"The news was carried to the home
paper, and each one of those six men
wrote to the sick man and told him
that the job waos secured through his
ownpersonal influence and efforts. Then
it came out that the cho.p couldn't take
the job hecause the l!ac: isn't far
enough above tidewater.
"Therepon," saitl the Iowa man as
he savagely bit the end oft a cigar.
"each of the six friends back home
wrote t') aw. giving wne tallywhackl be
cause the fellow wouldn't take the job
they had individually secured for him.'
The seats of Senator Cullom of Illi
nois and Senator Quay of F'ennsylva
nia are side by side in
McDonalds the senate, and, though
they frequently differ
Office Boy as to the course legis
Sltion should take, the
two age on the best of terms. The oth
er day, when Senator Beveridge of In
diana was delivering one of his ha
rangues against Quay's statehood bill
and the Pennsylvanian was trying hard
not to let it ruffle him, Cullom asked in
reminiscent mood:
"Quay, do you remember McDonald
of Indiana? He used to occupy the
seat you now have right beside me."
Quay said that he did, with a show
of impatience which did not disturb
the Illinois senator in the least.
"Well, what I was going to tell you
about was that once, twenty years ago,
he told me he had an otffice boy who in
sisted on studying law in his office and
who he believed had the material in
him to make one of the leaders in his
state and whose name would some time
become famous."
Quay showed still more impatience
at the Illinois senator's reminiscences
and the speech of Beveridge, and burst
out with, "Suppose he did, what has
that got to do with statehood and the
present tangle I am in?"
"Oh, nothing," said Cullonm, "only
that's his office boy speaking over there
now," he said as he directed his index
finger toward Senator Beveridge.
In the course of an earnest and pa
thetic plea for a pension for one of his
constituents Representative Shattuc of
Ohio said:
"Mr. Speaker, this man is totally
blind. He is dependent on what the
government gives him for sustenance.
His sight is gone, and I recall that one
day he came and saw me"
Shattuc was for a time at a loss to
understand why his colleagues were
moved to mirth over so serious a mat
ter.
When Senator Depew was well un
der way the other day with his anti
statehood speech, he encountered Sen
ator Bate, who went off on an extend
ed discussion of some topic suggested
by what the New Yorker had said. Mr.
Depew waited and waited and at last
sat down.
"The president of the New York Cen
tral," suggested a facetious senator in
an undertone, which was, nevertheless,
audible all around, "has run 'into a
dark tunnel."
Apropos of Senator Hanna's recent
indisposition, resulting from an un
usually severe attack
Didn't of his old enemy, the
nt rheumatism, this story
Want His is tole:
Legs In the last presiden
' ' tal campaign Senator
Hanna had been elected chairman of
the national committee, but on account
of frequent attacks of rheumatism he
was talking about turning the work of
the canvass over to some one else.
These reports reached President Mc
Kinley and he sent for his old friend.
"What's this I hear, Mark, about
your not goipg to have active charge
of the campaign?" he asked.
"Well," replied the senator, "I have
been thinking about it on account of
my health."
'T.ell me what is the matter with
you," said the president.
Senator Hanna then told the presi
dent that the rheumatism in his leg
gave him a great deal of trouble, made
it rather hard for him to get about and
perhaps interfered with his efficiency
as a campaign manager.
"Well, Mark," said, McKinley, with
the faintest suggestion of a smile, "I
don't want your legs in this campaign."
That ended the discussion, and Sena
tor Hanna reinained at the helm to the
en d of the campaign.
Among the callers at the White
House the other day were a New York
woman and her
daughter, aged
seven. The pres
Ident received
them cordially,
and, following
the introduction,
the little girl
asked:
"Mr. Presi
dent, do you sit
on a thorn?"
"What is that,
my child? I
don't think I un
derstand you."
"I mean, do
you sit on a
thorn ?"
The little girl's
mother, with vis
ible embarrass
ment, explained:
"I think she
means to ask
you if you sit
on a throne."
The president "Do YOU SIT ON A
