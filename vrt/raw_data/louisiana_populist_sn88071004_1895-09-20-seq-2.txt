The Finance Committee of New a
Orleans agreed to appropriate $5,
0fM( to aid in keeping in check the
small pox, which is prevalent in
that city. t
In Natchitoches. as in all the other 3
parishes the Democrats will handle the
Pops without gloves, and when the cam
paign is over they will have learned E
more good sound political sense than
they would otherwise have learned in a
life time.-Shreveport Judge. I
That's right, neighbor, truly you
are "a Judge of small matters." t
No doubt the Democrats who try 1
to handle the Pops without gloves
will be sadder, but wiser men, but
we did not expect you to admit it a
this early in the campaign. I
t
Wrotle to the Wrong lau.
Congressman Hunter, of Bowlinr t
Green, Ky., recently addressed a
letter to Governor Holcomb, in
which he requested the governor 3
to assist in raising a fund in Ne- '
braska "to aid in the election of a I
Republican governor in Kentucky, s
and thus break the solid south."
Governor Holcomb, who is a
populist, replied that it would '
please him very much to witness a
breaking up of the solid south, but I
that be would regret to see thel
people of Dixie throw of the yoke
of Cleveland Democracy only to
assume the bonds of such an or
nisation a the Republican party. i
governor adds: "Your letter *
was doubtlees addressed to me be- I
cause the news of the partial re
demption of Nebraska from Re
publican misrule had not yet reach- t
ed the headqarter, of the Repub- i
olan exemtive committee of Ken
tucky, therefore I return the com
muamstkon, as you would doubt
less net desire to have it given
publicity."

Put 'Up or Shut Up. y
Last week our Enterprise advi
ses "Free Coinage Populists,"
which must mean all, for there
never was a Populist who didn't a
Ielieve in the free coinage of silver
at 16 to 1, to come back to the
Democratic party to get it, as it t
says there is no earthly chance to
get it in the Populist party. A
SNow, if the Enterprise is in
earnest about this invitation, it
will have to do three things or
stand convicted of insincerity and
false cavil.
let. It must show by the votes li
* of Democratic congressmen and
Presidents, and by Democratic 6
platforms, that the Democratic par
* ty is in favor of the free coinage tl
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
2nd. It must show, by authen- p
tic records and not by idle asser
tions that any Populist ever elected
to any office in these United States
* cast any vote or did any act against al
a the free coinage of silver, at the tl
ratio of 16 to 1, as it so insolently
and falsely charges in its article.
a 51
3rd. It must open the doors of
the Democratic party to these invi
ted guests, who at worst, have made ti
e fewer mistakes than the people who ti
are doing the inviting. h
If you really desire us to come o
back, neighbor, as you say you do, a
n it s only fair for you to do all ti
three of these things, and from c
r your loud boasts we presume it v
e will be no trouble for you to do it. d
i So trot out your records like you 8
a did at Campti the other day, and m
let's get this little matter settled. a
n But don't go and waste a lot of ti
" time on that old speech of Joe
Y Wheeler's which he never deliver
s ed, but had printed in the Con- z
it gressional Record, for it is a tissue t
it of lies, and has been so proven i,
long ago. It will be a waste of
time, as it wasat Campti, sandt life's
too short to have to prove a lie a
p, twice m the same campaign. c
Trot out your record, neighbor, n
r your friends are getting impatient, f
and the Pops are gettingdisgusted.
a We hare some records we want to t
', show up if you will only piteh is I
and give us an opening. We are ii
a little too modest to open the pot, d
a but will stay in as fong as the fe- r
it low who doesn't hold a better hand. t
e So put up or shut up.
That inexplicable political jim
r. plecute, the Shreveport Progress, F
r says to the Sabiaw imer, who r
has swallowed abant enough Wall I
Street, Goldbug Republicanism in
the Democratic party, and is talk
- ing of leaving it, "hat wiR ane- t
k- er do, 8orrelleV" "They want you e
to leave the party." "But don't r
Sdo it, Sorrelle!" Figh for your 5
ooavictious, but stand by your par
ty, just to take the old pirates by r
the throat if for nothig else.
Take back what you here ay, and I
now declare that you will support t
e the nominee, gorldbu or ilver ad
Svocate-just to be able to lbm gbe a
1 bones if for nothing else."
SWe ao thought Bro. Hicks  a
r brave, true man, but alas, how j

you will support the nominee, gold

, Wonder what they called the
men of Hicks' stripe in the days
of the struggle between the patriot
and the tory, for American liberty.
Guess they hadn't coined the word
i nor the man either. Think Hicks'
type is a later production-a cross
between the kicker and the flopper.
A flea as it were, which refuses to
'n he driven out from under the bos
ses' clothes, but continues to kick
and bite the boss.
For over three years now Bro.
Hicks has raised a tempest in his t
little tea pot agaiust the bosses,
and he has not even himself in
fighting shape, to say nothing of
r- an army of well-drilled soldiers
that he should have fighting.
Last summer, when we heard
Peter Trezevant say that he wouldi
see that Hicks came back into the
Democrrtic party, so that all who c
voted for him for Congress might
Salso be able to come back, we lit
e te thought that the arch schemer
could reach and so influence his
supposed political enemy.
A Yes, vote for the goldbmgs, Bo .
- Hicks, if they are nominated, which
they are sure to be by the machine
10 to which you are clinging, but we
have an abiding hope that there are
ie enough patriots in America--des
a, cendents of Revolutionary ances
lI tors-who like Sorrelle, hold prin
m ciple above party, and who will
it vote as their consciences dictate, to
t. down the combined votes of Wall
Âºu Street, Wall Street tools, and the
Kd week-knees, like Bro. Hicks, who
are held to Wall Street by party t
A ties.

promised to bust and didn't do it.
made cotton go up, aind will nmake
it go down in time to catch the
bulk of the crop out of the hands
o. of the producer.
"If the Pops really think they
are in the tight-or is it a joke."
No; they've found no fighting,
and are too much disgusted with
the enemy to joke.
"How much more. cotton would
be worth if it was not for the Third
) party." That depends upon who
was the `'econd party. History
rs tells us what it was worth under
*d both Republican and Democratic
( administrations, while the Pops are
not loaded with the burden of "a
chance" thrown away.
o "If there will be enough of the
Third party left even for a spike
team, when the other fellow sees he
is not the nominee." That de
pends again upon who the "Third
party" is. In this parish it is the
h Democratic party, the Pops being
the First, so we will answer no.
e "Why, the Pops think the coun
re try will be saved, if they can only
elect their unlimited silver consta
- bles." Because the country's en
emies, the goldbug constables, will
be out of place and power to do
the country harm. Ask us some
ll thing hard.
"Whom the Pops will elect
President of the United States in
1896--if not Coxey." Sorry not
y to be able to satisfy yowr curiosity
here, but it will satisfy suffering
ti- humanity a great deal to know that
ie it will not be Grover Cleveland.
Ie "If the anarchists were taken
out of the Third party, how much
I. smaller squad it would be." Aboot
n, two-thirds its present size, and
much larger than the Democratic
party will be when the counting
I. machine is busted in a few more
e parishes like it has been in Natchi
P. toches.
of We hope our catechism next 1
week will continue on this enlight
be ening plane with an upward ten
be dency.

free silver barbecue was given at
