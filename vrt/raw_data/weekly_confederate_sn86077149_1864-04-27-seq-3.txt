We agree with Mr. .Stephens, that "oar

I --'-ruts of the people arc clearly to be pre-

But ef the "Congressional right by the

slier unquestionable ; and when sosjwnded, the
power of arrest may be invested inlbe Ilead
of the Government.
We shall only now point out how guarded
Was Cougresa been in the act of suspension,
and how careful the Government ha been in
the exercisc'of the powers bestowed, to make
our notice of Mr. Stephens complete J and we
are content to let his speech, with our crm
ments, he fairly judged by the people of North
Carolina.
Mr. Stephens' Spiecch---Conrladed. ,
In closing our -review of Mrt Stephens'
speech, we undertake to show that thy Mate
act suspending the privilege, of the writ of
habeas corjms, more etTectually guars the
rights of tlie eitizin, thau Mr. Stephens pi in
proposes ; and indeed, that it imposes such
compete check upon arbitrary p.wer that
there is not a possibility of oppression to
grow out of it, without expoore a i l punish
ment. Firit: The suv?!ision is temporary and
d-MKoody extend at the farthest to ninety
days after the meeting of the next Gongress.
Second: It does not, as in- England, pro
vide an indemuity for the acts committed
und- r it, but manifestly leaves to an arrested
party full -legal remedy for any and every act
of injustice. It not ouly does this by with
holding ind-'muity, but it does not even pre
vent the i.-sue of the writ of habeas corpus
At fir t we thought it did ; but we now con
cur with Judrc Pearson, that it simply abeys
r ceases proceedings after the return, is made
aceorJ ii(j to iJte fur ax prescribed by Gmgress.
that th- case will proceed from the point
at -w iich it stopped, so s on S the suspen
sion is remove!; aud thereupon, the party
injiired'will be remitted tv his remedy against
all concerned.; -
It not only does this, but it limits andmle
iiaes the cases in which the suspension is to
occur, all of them being case involvinjr the
very s-ifety of the nation as treason, conspi
racies to overthrow the Government, to assist
the enemy, t i lcit-j insurrect'on of slaves,
desertions .and encouragement there jf, at
tempting to avoid military service. These
are the cases m isrof them and ia this last,
the party cHhning exemption has an appeal
from subordinate to superior officers; and the
subordinate, besides his civil liability, risks
b?ing peremptorily dismiss d, if he. perpe
tra!es injustice. ' . -
Xot only so, hut it rpquircs the appoint
ment of civil
Mtgistrates-
-( mmissioners r
who sit like judges, with similar ohhgatiops
and responsibilities, to give the speediest in-
vestig ition to cases of pnsous arrested, in
order that tliev m iv be discharged :fimnrou
trlv arrested, or tried in duo curse of law.
N'ow examine Mr. Stejdiens' construction.
3v it, not the President, but a ver.td, malicious
pro.-cutor, by a false oath before a corrupt or
iuoraat magistrate for there are such, as 1
. there are always bad persons amoYig members
of any -class may arre-t a cit'en on any of
the ca.ies presented by the act: the suspension
removes lh privilege of giving bail, and the
party is hehl in prison to the next term of the
court before he can get a heiring. Instead of
tVie .'liberty of the., citizen, being .placed.. in. the
keeping of . the head of the Government, wth
all its responsibilities, for-a careful protectiou,
by Mr. Stephens; it is committ"l to the keep
ing of the multitude , of civil magistrates
through the laud ; mauy of wiim are ignorant
and 'irresponsible.--Eveti in: this ase 'we
shpu'l not apprehend '"great danger, for Ve
have great faith that en light, nid public. senti
meat "would prevent oppression,, But of: the
two, the citizen is much worse -protected by
Mr. Stephens.
In a1dition to the giiartls provided by the
law the instructions from . the Department

Ou the morning of. the ICth ef April, jthere
app?ared in. the Vaily. rrgtts of this citythe
following editorialr hich the editor of that
paper claims the repri'sibility :":J; ' '

V citizens of the Slate and hare a right to demand

" What has Gov. Vance done or what is be doing
to give, these men a hearing ? Surely the mili

"ander the Act suspending the Writ :-of habeas
" corpus, for that promises every man arresteeT'a
" speedy hearing of his case." -: Has' Gov. Vance.
" asked, or. rather hag he demanded that these
" men have a speedy hearing ?' '
Now this paper professes an ardent devotion
to the Southern cause; boasts of its sacrifices
in its behalf, and weDelers. how vt or any other
person could distrust -its loyalty. 'We 'have
again and again replied to these lavish and pro
fuse pledges and professions, by the. publication
of various species of articles; some of thejn the
embodiment of foolish thoughtlessness ; some
the marked and distinct productions of political
party purpose, which at. times' rises above the
iuterest of the nation and coutrolls the head and
heart of this Troess-or ' of patriotism. At other
times we have quoted fromits. columns its o.wn
editorials, and the communications of others,
which were criminally seditious and treasonable,
well calculated to give the ' enemy : " aid and
cotnfort, " and from which the enemy did preach
hope to our invaders. Of this class, (the last,),
is the article we comment upon to-day. - ;
. Take the ticne of its publication : - It Avas just
on the eve of an imjtirtant movement a move
ment hazardous in its undertaking, destined
to be full of peril in i:s prosecution, and fraught
with the most vital consequences to the State
and to the Confederacy in its consummation :
being ho less than a movement for -the rescue
of Eastern North Caroling the recovery of.
eiur occupied Towus--rthe re-occupation of our
Sound -.waters, the capture 'of Ilirtteras arid
R unoke Islarid,and tie restoratfon to our
exiled refugees of their homes .and",propertjr.
We had -been in possession ;of the. fact of this
project(-d move for some time ; ami no anxious'
have we been to withdraw the public attention
from it, that we preferred rather to risk some
Creation of alarm, by intiumtiig a. danger to
this place, -rather than by premature allusijn
impede or hinder in the slightest degree this
con fcir.plated enterprise..''" About the 16th . of,
April, or a tittle, before, this movement be-
gan to be stispectwi and talked of ; then of all
tinips was the moment fur a public paper
friendly to the cause to remain hushed, ou all
matters which might embarrass the officers dn
charge of this undertaking;- .-.-:
Now, what dues the Progress dp ? It draws

be allowed to survive antl breathe fresh air.
