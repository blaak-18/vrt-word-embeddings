his Lost year the general average was
at" maintained during September, the con
d dition as reported in Ortoher equaling
the splendid crop of 1879 and surpas
et sing any intervening year. Texas then
rife reported a very en crop, some counties
,e. giving prospective averages as high an a
io hbale to the acre. The bureau then said :
"With the increased acreage planted the
crop now promise an outturn of upward
of 5.00',,000 bales."
The New York Chronicle estimated the
et crop October 16, 1878, based on its own
figures of acreage (which were larger
in than the bureau's), and on the bureau's
or statement of condition, at 5,235.250, re
ora marking "that, nndoubtedly, will be con
red sidered by many a very large estimate;
but we see no reason for questioning It
ns or for btlieving that the crop will in
ad any event fall below that total." How.
ap ever it did "fall below that total" about
3 per cent.
SThis year there are only two States
ld Arkensa and Tennessee that show a
higher condition than last season, and I
the general average is 9 per cent lower.
Texas, with 10 per cent. Increase in
acreage, thin rear ought to have yield
ed nnder as Isvorable circumstances as
last season, 1,012,000 bales ; while, so.
cording to the per cent. of condition now
reported by. the bureau, she will fall
shbort of this by 383,000 bales.
The 8epteniser report of the bureau
pointed to a crop of 4,923,000 bales, but
the prolahilitiee are now rtduced by
over 400,000 bales from these fgures.
b- This prospective deficit of 353,000 bales
in the American supply will more than
feet any increase In the nEgyptian rop,
and any probable sugmentation in India
production.
As consumaption during the past season,
even under all the disocuragng circns
stances conncted with t trade, ran
ahead of the supplies, should our crop 11
taur out as mall as indicated in the foreL
e going calculation, there must le a higher
range of prices to avert an absolute 01
famine during the last quarter of the
cotton year.
