WHY NOT FORM A CLUB?
Get some of your neighbors together, who
are not already subscribers to the Jeffersonian,
and let them pitch in a quarter apiece to pay
for their political education for the next three
months. Let them read the Weekly Jeffer
sonian for that time, and if they are not then
able to take part in the graduating exercises,
we’ll quit and call it square.
We .need the quarters. Your neighbors need
the education. A quarter pays for three months’
subscription to the Weekly Jeffersonian.
