It is the duty of every American

.. TED ROAD TO VI ITORY.
Wharton Barker, in The American.
6. 1. We declare our fixed pur
pose to work for the restoration of
silver to its time-honored place as
money, side by side with gold.
Believing, moreover, that it is
y America's place to command, not
d to follow, we spurn to wait upon
or Great Britam or any other foreign
e, nation, especially as we recognize
's that Great Brrtain is ruled by the
creditor clasees among whom con
verts to bimetallism are only made
t at the eost of hundreds of ruined
produts n America and other
tr nationsm.
in To this end we pledge ourselves
a to the prompt repeal ofll laws by
which silver has been demonetized
and its use abridged, to prohibit
' all discriminations by the govern
id meat or any of its officers against
-. elth gold or silver, and to admit
m both metals to the right of free
sad unlimited coinage at our mints
at the ratio of 16 to 1, with full
power for all the money thus coin
sj ed as legal tender for all public
io dues and in all transactions of the
Scitisea.
S R. ecogizing that the govern
meot should guard over the meas
I ure of value even more scrupu
n lously than it guards over the
d measures of weight, distance and
. quantity we pledge ourselves to
oppose all schemes for the retire
ment of our man interest bearing
national paper money, and the
Ssubstitution of bank currency
r-therefor, we protmest against the
e surrender of this sovereignP power
a to the banks, and we demand that
all issues of paper money whatso
ever, shall be issued directly by,
n and the volume thereof controlled
' by the National Government.
"V . We view with alarm the
rapid eontralisation of capital and
tom unexampled growth of trusts
e and combinations designed to re
I pres competition m raise prices
byrestricting production, but in
view of the appreciation of gold
resulting in the impoverishment of
our people and the restrietion a
the opb'aing power of the com-;
Smuaty sueh growth is not surpris
-I ag. Consumption being greatly
cutalled, seek a thing as compefi
SItion among buyers is unknown.
COmpettion among producers [sel
I mnot being balanced by com
among buyers, becomes I
and Smerer natd loUlly the i
-very advantalg that ahould aecrue
to the consumer from competition <
arme unuled by thei destruction of
muay competitors, while the sur- <
virvors are driven to oombine and
restrict prodution in order to
maitan prics and save themselves
from Phar ptc. .1
Natmurally, ad rightly, such
trais and combinations excite the
enmity aof th public, for while by s
moopollsin the products of va
lrous aruticles of amaufacture they t
are snhbld to tax the consumer in
the ahapeof an noduly enhanced c
pried for what he buys, the wage
earnr, mployed by esueh combi- t
aims, reuolves no benefit from t
the enaknced price charged the
coieommer for the product of his
labor. On the contrary, while the t
cimem ermmle oblged to pay trust a
lpricm the wag-earner as forced to t
set trstwages 8uch a state
of assirs eas be ftolerated, and 5
we demand ahe legislation us will e
prevnt the formation of trusts

tiesomeomer on the oe hnedaend o

ibtr are justly distributed, that a

beeit of ti few, and to the end n
"th ael producers shall enjoya

shouli not he tolerated, and to the
1 end that all produtcers may he ac
e corded the same treatment anul pro
tected against unjust charges, we
demand that the government own
and operate our railroads and tele
graphs.
:. We demand the maintenance
of a true Protective System, a
system that will
(a) Protect American labor
f' against underpaid and degraded
:I European and Asiatic labor, and
h secure to American citizens the
American markets.
(b) Demonstrate that protec
tion is a national question, not a
claws question, and that protective
duties are not imposed for the bone
fit of any class, but for the public
advantage of (1) diversified indus
tries, (2) the industrial independ
ence of the nation, (3) the main
tenance of comfort and intelligence
f among the people, and (4) the pro
5 motion of domestic commerce
through extension andLimprove
w ment of the means of communica
t tion.
But where trusts and combina
t Lions, sheltered by protective tariff
3 duties, have monopolized produc
tion, thus repressing domestic com
-petition, we urge unhesitatingly,
in the interests of the wage-earner
l and consumer, the removal of all
protective duties from all import
ed articles which such trurts.and
combinations have monopolized.
6. We demand legislation that
l will prohibit immigration of sub
jects or citizens of foreign coun
tries, unless such immigrants in
tend to become citizens of the
United States, and unless they can
demonstrate that they have not
been of the criminal classes in the I
countries from which they emi- c
grated.
7. We protest against the sale
of public lands to alihens, and we
demand legislation that will pro
hibit such sale and ownership. e
8. We demand for the people e
of the United States an American
policy thorough and strict, and i,
withll possible emphasis we re- ti
affirm the principles of the Meon- a
roe Doctrine as enunciated by
Thomas Jefferson, that: "Our
first and fundamental maxim should
be never to entangle ourselves in v
the broils of Europe; our second,
never to suffer Europe to inter
meddle with Cis-Atlaatic affairs.

before the election. Jerry told a
reporter that on sitti tht the table
with the boy, he ope naSdialogue
with him:
"My son, what has become of
your~watch 1"
"Bet it on the election."
"And the ring I gave you last
Christmas I"
"Upon the.electon, . too."
"And the pony '"
"I put him up to .say tbhat Bar- a

"And the saddle-what has be
come of that|"
"Oh, the saddle is all right, if at
certain man named Simpson car
ries Harper county by 200."
"And the shotgun 1"
"Up against $6 that Long
wouldn't carry Sedgwick county."
"Have you anything at all left?"
"The clothes that I am wearing
and an extra shirt."
"What has become of your lit
tle bank accountl"
"Staked on the political fortunes
of my house. I wish I had some
moto money for two men down at
the livery stable have $100 to say
that Iong is elected."
Jerry Simpson epped his coffee
meditatively, and, rising from the
table, took out his check book and
gave the boy $100. In a short
time the boy came back and said: m:
"Pop; those livery stable fellows ha
may they would like to have anoth
er $100 of Simpson money.
Jerry wrote another cheek, and Is
in ten minutes the boy, havinge
led it, came back and said;
I have bet 'em on a standstill. g
They want odds now."
"How mucht" said Jerry.
'"Tey want me to give 'em 1,000
Os that's all right," smaid Jer
ry, as he made opt a check for
another hundred.
The boy placed it, and after this f
no more bets were offered.
