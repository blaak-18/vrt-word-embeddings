"ONCE MORE THE INSIDIOUS PERUNA"
The following is a copy of an edit
orial clipped from the New Orleans
States, issue of March 26:
"A few days ago the States published
an editorial containing comments more
or less lightsome on the rude invasion
which the exhilarating besierage known
as Peruna has made in the prohibition
districts of Mississippi and North
Louisiana, where failure to attend
church with punctilious regularity is a
crime, and to be discovered with a
flask of Pike's Magnolia in your clothes
means banishment from the community.
We are gratified to note that the edit
orial referred to has produced an echo
in the form of the following letter from
a very frank and truthful minister of
the gospel who in some way has man
aged to get 'a straight line' on Peruna I
and who is well acquainted, evidently,
with its ingredients and its potency.
The minister says:
"'A friend having called my attention
to your recent editorial, entitled "The
Perunaic Curse," I wish to express my
gratification at the stand which you,
together with the Lafayette Gazette
and Ruston Leader, have taken to ex
pose this disguised intoxicant. I have
been fighting this form of liquor ,for
some time, both in public discourse and
private endeavor, The saddest feature
to me is the endorsement given to Pe
runa and kindred "remedies" by promi
nent men, especially ministers of the
gospel, who are thus, unconsciously
perhaps, aiding tly infamous liquor
traffic Aid contributing to the great tide
of intemnorance.
"'Peruna contains from. 0o to 75 per
cent of alcohol, and is far more intoxi
cating than wine, beer or whiskey. So
it is with all thie so-called "tonics."
They are composed chiefly of alcohol,
and the unsuspecting victim, allured by
the' recommendation of minister and
the religious ,press which advertises
these intoxicants, acquires the alcohol
habit before he is aware of it. I have
been told by a druggist that women buy
these "tonics" because of their stimulat
ing effects. It is so much more respect
able to get tipsy. on Peruna than on
plain old Bourbon or rye ?
"'Just here let me also utter a warn
ing against narcotics like "Mrs. Wins
low's Soothing Syrup," which is com
posed principally of opium. Helpless
infants and children are dosed with
these vile decoctions, and thus are
trained up to become alcohol and drug
fiends. What an awful responsibility
rests upon those who, by example and
precept, are thus aiding the devil in
hisdirty work ?
"'I did not expect the secular press
to cry out against this evil, and hence
I am all the more gratified that it has
the courage to do so.
"'An EVANGELICAL MINISTER.'
"We quite agree with our correspond
ent, that it is most 'reprehensible for
ministers of the gospel and the reli
gious press to recommend to their
brother and sister mortals such a pow
erful. jag-producing extract as Peruna,
and claim that it is a nerve tonic and
a sure cure for catarrh. How many
quiet 'nips' of Perina have been taken
in the sanctum of religious weeklies we
can not say, but we do know that many
an humble 'follower of the Lamb' likes
it very much and that it has caused
thousands of them to wander far from
the fold and entirely out of hearing of
the bell wether. We weep copionuly
when we think how ministers, presiding
elders and deacons have tasted it only
to be refreshed and to taste it again.
The sons of temperance are a unit in
favor of Peruna, because it does not
conflict with their lodge obligations
and at the same time fills in a mnost sat
isfactory manner a long-felt want.
There is not a prohibition state in the
coustry in which Peruna can not be
found in all the drug stores, and where
Abe for it is very (large and
cnstantly growing. This is due to the
act that it cures the deep purple thirst
oaofw spe d than it does the catarrhl,
and aeple seem td be afflicted
with At, thirst ailment than the catarrh.
*aala tHe' ate a' great many people
;1=iry to ws' who by ,reason o
are forced to admit that it never misses
a shot. This statement is mavde advised
ly. because several years ago we lin
gered with a devoted friend and a bot
tle of Peruna one evening in a country
town which was operated entirely by
preachers who had recommended Pe
runa as the only safe household medi
cine. That occasion will ever remain a
bright yet painful spot in our mind.
The hilarity exceeded three days and
the headache two weeks; hence we can
talk learnedly of the virtues of Peruna,
as our distiiguished correspondent
"Evangelical Minister" fully appreci
ates. His letter shows quite clearly that
he knows by experience exactly what is
in Peruna and what it is capable of per
forming when the cork is pulled and
the fragrant fluid is unleashed. We vio
late no confidence when we say that
there is no variety of jag desired that
Peruna can not quickly produce. It is
equal to all emergencies and satisfies
all customers. It is recommended by
ministers, because when they desire in
spiration for an effective .ermon all
they have to do is to take three full
doses every ten minutes. It never fails
to act, because it was compounded es
pecially for action.
"We must, in closing this article; as
sure our eorrespondent that we are in
cordial agreement also with his views
regarding soothing syrup, but we are
constrained to remark that in the prohi
bition districts of North Louisiana and
Mississippi soothing gyrup is 0- a dis
count; it is even more than a drug on
the market, because teething and fret
ful children are lulled into sleep by the
soporifc effect of an old-fashioned
spanking. Peruna has the right of way
everywhere, and the man who dares to
raises hand ior a voice against this
much-needed family me~dicine, which
has been so cordially and publicly en
dorsed by the church, is sure to breed a
revolution."
° We quite agree with the States and
would add that if one is disposed to get
on a jag he should tackle the genuine
red-eye, labeled "snake poison," if you
y will, and "full up" as a gentleman.
Why should any man having a claim to
- decency tank up on Pertnh or medicat
n ed alcohol when he can get the best old
rye or Bourbon full proof and warrant
ed pure? But the States is not alone in
its condemnation of this "Perunaic
Curse," since getting drunk on medi
cated& stuff in prohibition districts has
h aroused the protests of a number of
e newspapers throughout North Louis
I iana and other sections of the country.
' For instance, the Ruston Leader is au
d thority for the statement that "three
n fourths of the druhkenness and disor
derly conduct in Ruston is traceable to
s the excessive drinking of Peruna."
e The Lafayette Gazette says: "The
s demon of intemperance has made his
appearance in the prohibition districts
of North Louisiana. This time the
- whiskey devil is disguised in Peruna
r bottles, guaranteed to cure all the ills
- that flesh is heir to. Newspaper readers
r need not be told what Peruna is. It is
- not only claimed to be a panacea for ;ll
, bodily ailments, but it enables hundreds
a of congressmen and governors to get
their pictures in the newspapers. Were
it not for its advertisements it is safe
e to say that many worthy statesmen
would never see their likenesses printed
s in the papers and would be condemned
I to go out of public life unknown to
n fame and printers ink.
f "But Peruna does more - than that.
F Besides curing all the 4iseases of man
g and affording to politicians an easy ve
Y hicle to immortality, it is a very suc
cessful spbstitute for 'booze."'
Another authority on this subject
t says: "In prohibition towns and dis
s tricts where the jug trade is more or
- less restricted, Peruna is in great de
mand. The man who gets his whiskey in
e the jug will rarely drink to excess, but
e if he should become intoxicated on the
e genuine article he would be condemned
I and perhaps held for some violation of
e law, but any one in a prohibition town
t or district may get tanked up on Pe
F
runa, which can produce any efrect de
sired from a fighthng drunk to a-give
away-the-whole-town drunk to a jolly,
poetical. singing, dancing, or a regular
"snakes-in-your-boots" drunk. It is no
wonder that Peruna (and other medi
cated stuffs) is popular and in demand
since any gentleman, regardless of his
profession, can have about him the
ready and the handy black bottle from
which he can soothe his catarrh or clear
his throat of cobwebs. At any rate, it
seems to satisfy the craving of some
people who declare it is sinful to take a
nip of old rye or Bourbon, which only
the wicked drink. But the question is
how to repress and uppress the medi
cated stuffs loaded with drunks. "raise
hell" and bust-heads."
DAMAGE BY STORM.
It Was a Gale and the Wind Blew Most
Violently.
Newport News, Va., April 1.
Heavy damage ashore and afloat was
wrought by wind and water during a
storm here. The storm culminated in
a violent gale. The tide reached a
danger point within two feet of the
level of the floors of the piers and
threatened to bring great disaster to
property along the water front.
To venture out into the raging seas
was equivalent almost to suicide and
seafaring men stayed on shore rather
than risk their lives on the waves.
The two-master schooner William B.
Hall'bound up the James river to Nor
folk with 3b,000 brick, sank at her
anchorage and will probably be a total
loss. The captain and crew of two
men put off from the boat in an open
skiff as she was going down and at
tempted to reach shore. The. men,
who were all negroes, fought frantical
ly against the elements. They were fi
nally compelled to give up the fight
and sank exhausted into the bottom of
the boat. The men were exposed to
the storm until 6 o'clock on Monday
morning, when they were rescued by
the Cheaspeake and Ohio tug Alice.
They were almost frozen when picked
up.
The dead body of William Collier of
the oyster pungy W. B. Smith, which
capsized in Cheaspeake bay Jan. 30,
was cast up by the sea at Ocean View.
The body of a negro, probably from
a shipwreck in the storm, was found
in a fisherman's net at the mouth of
Hampton creek.
MURIPHY'S DECISION.
Of the Opinion That Arthur Pennell
Could Have Been Held.
Buffalo, N. Y. April 1.-Judge
I Murphy handed down his finding in
the Burdick inquest and declared the
Identity of the murderer has not been
proved. Th~e statement is an exhaus
tive review of the evidence brought
out in the inquest. Special attention
is given to the letters exchanged be
tween Arthur R. Pennell and Mrs.
Burdick, particularly one containing
a threat against Burdick's life. Con
cerning these the judge says: "Alto
gether these facts, in my opinion, con
stitute just ground for suspicion on
which a warrant could be issued were
Pennell alive."
Referring to Mrs. Hull, Judge Mur
phy says: "The action of Mrs. Hull
on that morning (morning after the
murder) and her testimony on the
stand has caused me much thought
and worry. To mhy mind they are In
consistent with a perfect want of
knowledge as to what actually occur
red. So little apparent feeling for
the dead man and such evident desire
to evesr up the crime and no disposi
ticn whatever to aid the authorities In
apprehension of the murderer may be
explasaable, but have not been ex
plaiaed."
*TERRIBLE RESULTS.
