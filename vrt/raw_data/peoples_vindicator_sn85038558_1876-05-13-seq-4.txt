The unprecedented success with which
the Timee has met, since its establish
maent, is convincing evidence that the
people of the West and South, full ap
preciate the efforts of a journal, which,
mi addition to its enterprise as a news
:aper, has the courage to boldly declare
md constantly maintain the principles
f its political faith.
The public journal mostly deserving or
1)meooratic enpport is the one that, in
uddition to being a full and faithful and
.onsistoent advocate of Demnocr:atic prin
* iples. A Democratie newspaper is the
Sewspaper for Democrats to support, and
mhe idea sometimes sought to be iuelc-a.
ted by those who have an interest of their
-wn in doing so that the people nmust go
atside their party organ to "find the
'ews," is absunrd and irrational. ThereM
is no sort of incompatibility whatever
between the politicetl and nIon-political
jaurnal as to the matter of news; many
of the papers now published throughout
tihe country, and especially valuable for
;he amount and, variety of their intel
lgence, being also known for the ability
aid earnestness with which they chanm
pleaion their peculiar party views. Hence
all things else being equal, it is manitsat
Ty the duty ofDemoerata to limit their
nuwspaper patronage to such as are of
their own way of thinking, and not to
squander their means on those that wage
constant warfare upon their estalllished
conviOtions.
It is our desire to see the Times in the
bhand of all D)emocrats, antid every well
wisher of the Government throughout
the land, and in order that this may be
done, we are now offerintg the following
extraordnlinary inducements to those who
will Interest themselves and act in the

WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1876.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular huamorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changedtl to a fortnight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
nuasterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success thain
before, and was recognized as tiN ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have ytelded still further to the public
demanld, antd now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its inttrinsie merits, he
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnis!l illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to famie.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most'fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
TERS t" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessiug the remarkable qualities of Vin
sOAR BITrns in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Dn. WALK
se's VINIIARi Brras are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Caruinative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Cowater-Irritant,
Sudorific, ~Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through.
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and reimarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
f heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. in their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
enus organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Da. J. WALKEWRS VINEGAR
BiT'ras, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy fune
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with

For Inflammatory and Chronfe

these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis

whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re

system from wormls like these Bitters.

that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you tind its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,

structed and sluggish in the reins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow,
