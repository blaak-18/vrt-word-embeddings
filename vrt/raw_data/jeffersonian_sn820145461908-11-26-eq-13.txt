The Ad Man’s Galley
"By fames Lanier,
We have received many letters late
ly from friends who wish to see the
party re-organized and built up so
that it will become a real power in
the land. The words are encourag
ing. In some cases, practical help is
offered, in the shape of promised
yearly contributions to the cause.
That is more than encouraging, since
the deed is greater than the word.
To each of our friends we would
point out away by which they can
be of real service to the cause with
out embarrassing themselves finan
cially and without too great encroach
ment on their time. Circulate the
Jeffersonians, both Weekly and Mag
azine. Send for free sample copies
and give them to your neighbors. Ask
them to give you a three months’
trial subscription, which costs only a
quarter. Get our agents’ rates, which
are very low, and show your boys and
girls how they can earn money by
taking subscriptions for the Jeffer
sonians.
Tell your wife that she can get a
handsome china dinner service, or a
beautiful breakfast set, by securing a
few subscriptions; and, outside of the
premium list which we publish, if
there are any books or articles of
furniture that you would like to have,
let us know, and we will get them
for you at cost price, allowing you
to pay for them in commissions on
subscriptions.
Above all, remember that if you
have the welfare of the cause at
heart —if you really and truly be
lieve in the principles of Jeffersonian
Democracy—if you have the convic
tion that those principles, carried in
to practical effect, would benefit your
fellow men and women and the chil
dren that are growing up—then it is
your bounden duty to help to the ut
most in the spreading of those prin
ciples, and in educating others to the
same beliefs. There is no middle
course. You are either for us or
against us. Apathy is worse than act
ive opposition.
If you are a true Jeffersonian, get
out and hustle. Now is the time to
work —not tomorrow. The tw r o Jeffer
sonians are your weapons in the
fight for better, cleaner, truer things
in politics and life. Use them. We
will keep them bright and keen. Use
them.
Keep your subscription paid up.
We send a notice to each subscriber
when his time expires, and ask him
to renew. .If we receive no reply
within a reasonable time, we strike
the name from the mailing list. The
Post Office Department will not allow
us to keep subscribers on our books
definitely without payment.
app^ v often a man allows his sub
them, \to lapse, an j then, after a
knock! when he finds the Jef
let deceptj not
coming to him any
form hav p e m i sses jt, he will send
hideJijUar an d as k us to supply the
n Mk numbers. In the case of the
Magazine we can do this, but we can
not do it with the Weekly. This re
minds us of a story.
An old gentleman walked up to the
pretty girl attendant in the office of
a daily newspaper, and said:
“Miss, I would like to get copies
of your paper for a week back.”
“If you will go across the street,”
she replied thoughtfully, “you can
get a porous plaster.”
Here is a suggestion for those who
want to help the Jeffersonians. Mr.
Duke Samford, a good friend of ours
at Center, Texas, bought three or four
Jeffersonian Magazines, some time
ago, to sell to those who wished to
see what Mr. Watson had to say, but
didn’t care to subscribe, or were not
able to spare a year’s subscription.
Last month he ordered ten Magazines
for this purpose, and now he orders
twenty December magazines. “I
want to make it hot for the money
powers, the four years coming,” he
writes, “and if we don’t win then
I’ll make it hotter the next four.”
Can’t you buy a few magazines at
our cash price, and sell them to the
people at ten cents each? Your boys
and girls can earn a little money in
this way, and it will be helping the
cause wonderfully.
This is just puffery, you say? The
cry of the huckster? That’s true,
but neither you nor we can live un
less we let the people know the
value of our wares. Doesn’t the pol
itician get out on the stump? Even
the industrious hen can’t help chuck
ling when she lays an egg. It’s hu
man nature to advertise.
“He who whispers down the well
About the goods he has to sell
Will never reap the golden gleaming
dollars
Like he who climbs the tree and holl
ers. ’ ’
That’s good Darwinian philosophy,
when you come down to the bottom
of the jug.
By the way, the Jeffersonian'Maga*
zine will in future be one dollar a
year, ten cents a copy, and it will be
better and brighter than ever before.
Mr. Watson’s Life and Times of An
drew Jackson will be continued, and
he will also contribute some happy,
chatty editorials each month. The
Educational Department, the loss of
which was deplored by so many of
our readers, will be resumed. Gimme
that dollar.
Mr. S. L. Kenton, of Worcester
Mass., says: “I ran across a copy
of Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine at
Brother Fisher’s book store the oth
er day. It was the October number,
and I happened to read a few lines
of the editorial on “Our National
Finances.” I want to read a few
more lines like those, and enclose a
dollar for a year’s subscription, be
ginning with November. That is the
first honest piece of writing about
politics that I have read for many
a year. I was a Democrat. I am a
Jeffersonian.”
Mr. Frank Park, of Sylvester, Ga.,
thinks “one single editorial from
Tom Watson’s pen is worth twice the
price of the Jeffersonian.”
From the far Northwest Mr. J. B.
Ellis, of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada,
writes: “I look for the Jeffersonians
each week and month as I look for
letters from home. They light up
the darkness of my other literature,
and I can’t afford to miss a single
number. ’ ’

Invest Your Savings
If you have Ten Dollars,
Don’t let it lie idle.
Invest it in a Jeffersonian Bond,
Where it will draw Seven per cent.
Put some money aside for the kids,
Or a little for a rainy day.
These bonds are absolutely safe,
And they pay a high rate of interest.
There is no better investment
In the country to-day
Than a Jeffersonian Bond.
