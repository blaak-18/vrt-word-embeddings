Reports received from the Black
ea eoast and the Caucasus affrm
that endeavors to cultivate and
naturalize there the India rubber
tree known as il dichopsis gutta” are
proving eminently successful. Con
sidering how very restricted is the
geographical distribution of gutta
percha trees, great importance is
attached to this discovery.—-Kansas
City Journal.
At Gaylord, Mich., the other day
they cut down an elm that was eight
feet through at the base. It scaled
more than 10,000 feet. Another one,
although rotten at the base, was cut
off eighteen feet from the ground and
contained 5,000 feet. A third tree
in that section is twenty-seven feet
in circumference. The vandals have
spared it so far. —Kansas City Jour
nal.
The Missouri Pacific is leasing its
right-of-way to farmers along the
track near Mankato at 20 cents an
acre, to be farmed to within six feet
of the ends of the tires. No crop
except a hay crop of some sort is to
be allowed on the right-of-way. The
rate of 20 per cents an acre in
dicates that the Goulds are not trying
to increase their income, but have
adopted this plan to keep the right
of-way clean of weeds. —Kansas City
Journal.
The Rockefeller family organiza
tion, of which, by the way, John D.
is not a member, though many of its
members claim kinship with him,
has traced the history of the name
back to the south of France, where
there is still a Baron Roquefeuille.
The French Rockefellers, being mostly
Huguenots, went to Southern Ger
many after the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes; hence the Teutonic
form of the name. The first Rocke
feller came to America in 1720
Leslie’s Weekly.
Church bell ringing in London has
become such a nuisance in some quar
ters of the city that the bells are muf
fled on week days.
The Executive Committee of the
Thomasville, Georgia, Board of Trade,
having learned of Mr. Watson’s con
templated visit to that city on the
22nd inst., passed a unanimous resor
lution of welcome, which was grace
fully transmitted by Hon. C. S. Par
ker, President.
Hon. J. J. Brown, of Atlanta, is
spending several weeks in North
Georgia, where he will do a great deal
of valuable “missionary work” for
the cause. He will doubtless be at
the Holbrook camp ground meeting
and as many other rallies as he can
possibly attend.
The Hamburg expedition to the
Magellan Straits has issued a volume
in which particular attention is given
to “bipolarity,” that is to say, the
occurrence of similar types of animal
life at the two poles and their ab
sence from almost the whole of the
intervening area.
The foreign trade of the Philip
pine Islands for the calendar year
1907, exclusive of gold and silver,
now fiee government entries, was as
follows: Imports, $30,453,810; ex
ports, $33,097,807; an increase, as
compared with 1906, of $4,050,042 in
the imports and of $454,975 in the ex
ports.
Mr. Graves’ speech in Minneapolis
in which he denounced both Bryan and
Roosevelt, was far enough away not to
be heard in Chattanooga. Paralleling
what he said at Minneapolis with
what he said here in his Bryan birth
day speech would indicate the exact
quality of Mr. Graves’ political con
sistency. But what’s the use?—
Chattanooga Daily Times.
Every time Mr. Watson is to speak,
members of the arrangement commit
tee are asked: Are ladies allowed to
be present? OF COURSE. But
don’t say merely “allowed.” They
are invited and urged to come out to
hear him. Aside from the purely po
litical subject matter of his address
es, they are literary and historical
treats which no lady could fail to ap
preciate. It is a very thoughtless hus
band oi’ brother or sweetheart who
goes to a Populist meeting alone, on
the assumption that the “women
folks” don’t care for such things.
They do care, and their presence is
an inspiration to any worthy cause.
Os course, it isn’t serious enough to
cause a resignation, but then since we
are all so tremendously opposed to
corporations, it might help some if
Mr. Kern would just up and tell
frankly how he came to have that
railroad pass and on what account it
was issued.— :Daily Times.

“My love,” mentioned Mr. Suf
ferer-Gette, “I wonder —I wonder
whether you would let me have the
use of my latch key one day this
week ? ’ ’
“Latch key?” bellowed his wife.
“What the blazes do you want with
a latch key, my good man?”
“Well, my love,” coughed Mr. Suf
fer er-Gette, “we are holding a series
of fathers’ foregatherings in the mis
sion hall this week, when we hope to
do a little needlework on behalf of the
parish poor. Miss Nancy has kindly
consented to come and talk to us
about her recent farthest north trip,
and—”
“Great heavens!” roared the irate
wife banging her pipe upon the table
to emphasize her words. “Don’t you
know your duty is at home? Besides,
on Monday I’ve got to attend the
Women’s Emancipation league;
Tuesday the Sisters of Charity meet
ing; Wednesday the local police-wo
men’s concert; Thursday the Daugh
ters of Toil lecture; Friday, the Wo
men’s Science Research class, and on
Saturday our football club’s smoker.
Now, don’t you forget—your duty is
at home!”—Miss. Union Advocate.
