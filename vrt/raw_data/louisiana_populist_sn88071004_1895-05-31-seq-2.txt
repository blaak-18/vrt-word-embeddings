Mr. Walker spoke a- follows:
iIon. President and .Judge, Ladies and
(GutlemeIu
The invention of the steam en
eine and the almost miraculous ap
plication of elctricity, have mark
ed a magnificent era in the history I
antd development of mankind.
The iron wheel of Iime rolls on.
and with it comes the steady tramp I
of the army of progress, which is
sweeping the tield at every point t
with the formidable weapon of
scientific thought and research. I
The most sanguine dreams of our
ancestral prophets have been reali
zedl in more than ten times their
fulness.
Every age in mans evolution
presents new industrial ip)litical
and social problems for solution. I
The most pertinent question he- 1
fore the people of this age is trans- 1
portation, since it has assumned such
proportions, as to determine wheth- s
er the people shall be free, enlight
ened and happy, or oppressed, ig I
norant and miserable.
The founders of our great Re- c
public threw around the liberties c
of the people every possible safe- s
guard. The settlement of all con- t
flicting interests between States
and individuals were given to Con- c
gress. Power to establish a postal
system, an army, a navy, to con- t
trol commerce, was given into the s
same wise hands. These illustri- t
ous men could not foresee either
the blessings or curses of our mod- r
ern civilization. Railroads, tele- 3
graphs and telephones, the tri- t
umphs of modern inventive geni- (
us may be the means for producing t
the most ideal civilization ever e
thought of by the greatest politi- i
cal optimist; or they may be the t
tools in the hands ot avaricious f
corporations, which will destroy I
our time-honored liberties, and re- i
duce the Repubhe to a despotism 'I
as bad as thatendured by any Rus- t
sian subject. s
Facilities for transportation have I
marked the difference between an 1
enlightened and ignorant people. t
Rome, by means of her great sys- a
tem of national highways overcame a
the world. When her power was i
decaying, feudal lords seized upon 6
them and forced every person pass- .
ing over these roads to pay exor- f
bitant tribute.
To-day the great national high- v
ways and means of sapid commu- I
nication are owned by private cor- a
porations and individuals, to whom v
we Americans are paying the most ii
unreasonable tribute. i
As the feudal system of mana- a
ging highways retarded European f
growth for five hundred years, so
will America's progress be retard- F
ed if we permit a few to own our t
means of communication. c
Shall the people own and operate b
their highways and means of trans- ti
mitting intelligenoe? a
All attempts for governmental n
control with private ownership '
have proved failures. ti
Congress appointed the Inter- t
state Commerce Commission to 1
correct the evils of our railroad d
system. The records prove that
this has not been done, and that
the abuses they are supposed I
to right, are growini every day. e
We must have either govern- tl
meet ownership and operation, or
private ownership and operation. e
Whoever owns the nations high- 0
ways controls the nation. HIstory, b
statistics and logie prove this. Let o
us take up the fnancial phase of f
thisquestion. The revenue paid to o
railway compamnies annually, is
about 1,OO00,000,000. b
The little boys essay on man was, o
man isasmall animal that walks k
onhis hind legs. He eats inthe w
day, sleeps at night, and is very a
tame; you can touch him anywhere a
and he will not kick, just so you tl
don't tonehu him on the pocket book. a

Not a single cent of this state
ment which I give you has
been disputed, though it has been
I before the pullic for three years.
Take all these unnecessary expen
ses and profits that the people now
pay, from $1200,1h,00,(0X, the
amount paid them every year, we
will have $53s,000,00) , the actual
cash cost for the same service. un
ider government ownership. Why
such a loss when the people have
the power to prevent it.
The opponents of government
ownership say it will bankrupt the
government, and throw enormous
taxation upon the people. Let us
see if this objection will stand the
test.
The capitalized value of all the
roads in the United States is $11,
350,000|,0.0, their real value is be
tween $3,5().h004,001) and $4.5~0l,
(W)0,00(. It has been proved by
the sworn statements of the best
engineers in America, and by lead
ing statesmen, that every road in
the United States could he built
for $25,000 a mile. The St. Louis,
Iron Mountain, Southern railroad
is capitalized at $55,238 per mile.
The superintendent swore before
the Arkansas State Board of As
sessors that he could huild it for
$11,000( per mile. The Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe road is capi
talized for $48,095 ; several years
ago when rails were worth twice
as much as they are ncns, a state
ment was filed that the road could
be duplicated for $9,6;s5 per mile.
The Kansas Midland, is capitalized
for $53,024 per mile, but only cost
$10,200. The same is true of our
whole railrord, telegraph and tele
phone system. The creation of
seven billions fictitious capital on
which the people are forced to pay
interest and dividends is a scheme
more deadly and dangerous than
any planned since the dark ages of
feudalism.
At a liberal estimate of $25,000
per mile for road and rolling-stock.
the 168,000 miles of road would
cost $4,200,000,('). This could
be paid for in eight years, since all
the roads yield a net income of
about $5,000,000, with eood
management, every year. But we
might extend the time in which
the roads would pay for themselves
to o0, 30, or more years, or we
might pay for them with bonds
drawming a low rate of iterest, or
with non interest bearing bonds or
government legal tender notes.
et the people would never be tax
ed a single cent, and the credit of
the republic would be strengthened.
We pay the value of the roads
every ten years into the pockets of
corporations. Would it not be
better to pay for them once, and
own them, than to keep on paying
for them and let the other fellow
own them.
We do not propose any burly
burly revolution, any confiscation
of property, or any thing of the
kind, but with malice toward none,
we face it as a business proposition
asking for equal rights to all and
special privile(es to none, and for
the atet good to the greatest
number.
To commence governmental own
ership, the United States should
foreclose all mortgages nowi due on
Pacifioe ralr and by owning a
few of the trunk li at st CIrd

country.

Great Britain once enjoyed the
sweets of our present system, but
it soon lost its flavor and made her
sick, she could not endure tyranny,
so on February 10th, 1870, by an
act of Parliament the telegraphs
were transferred to the Postal de
partment.
The average rate for all messa
ges in England is 271 cents; in the
United States 7o cents. The rates
in England were once as high as
they are here, but as soon as the
government took lpssCssion the
rates were reduced one half, and
the tariff ii arly dou.ltd the first
'year.
The t .le'raph anld Ieliihone !w
ing a nlmeans for I he t ransnli'sion of
intelligence, are in trut ' a part o,f
our Ipostal system, and shoulid be
operated as such. Our postal sys
tem was once operated by private
companies, and then the people
paid 25 cents for a letter. We
might expect almost similar ad
vantages to result from govern
mental ownership. That it would
brineg great advantages is proved
by tie experience of almost every
nation on the globe.
Henry Clay, (cyrus W. Field,
General Grant, and many of the
best postmaster generals. have advo
cated a government telegraph.
The treat economist, Wannamaker,
said: "The rapid transmission of
correspondence is a part of the
business and proper duty of the
postoffice department, and it does
not fulfil its function or perform
its full duty until it operates the
telegraphs, the most rapid means
of transmission of intelligence."
With governmental ownership
we would have a telegraph in every
village, which would he operated
by the postmaster with huta slight
additional cost. Every country of
fice could have a telephone, which
might be extended to every home
for a few dollars. The slgnal ser
vice would save millions by this.
Farmers would be warned of com
ing storms, frosts, rains, etc., thus
saving many valuable crops. Peo
ple could send for the Doctor, ask
about their freight, and thus 65,
000,000 people would enjoy this
great blesssing where but two or
three millions now do.
The humane side of the question
is worth considering in an age
which is looking to the individual,
more and more. There are 35,000
people killed and wounded in the
United States every year by rail
road trains. We have no concep
tion of this great slaughter, unless
we suppose every person in Natch
itoches, Baton Rouge, Alexandria,
Ruston, Monroe and Shreve
port--suppose them all brought
to one place and some ma
chine invented to beat their
brains out, and tear their limbs
from their bodies, and then strew
from here to New Orleans. No
place on the way need one be more
than nine yards from a mangled
or maimed body.
Should American railroads adopt
the automatic car coupler, and
make better crossings, this great
sacrifice to the god of greed would
no longer be. But alast for the
blind adoration of the almighty
dollar, the honest American ecti
zen must suffer. The deaths are
about six times as numerous on
American roads as European roads.
Many of the worst accidents are
caused by over work, which would
be strictly regulated by govern
ment ownership.
The moral side of this question
is as far reaching as the republio
itself. The railroad king givmes
forth his decree in every branch of
govrernment, from the justice court
to the Supreme bench, land from
the police jury to the United States
Congreas. A lobby has been es
tablished in Wsino already,
signisantly caed te third house,
Wmt itpta ahead of al the others

.Such a power is a most deadly
menace to, free institutions, and
should he comnatted as the crown
f ing evil of the l9th century.
The railroad presidents 'have thr
more patronage at their disposali
- than the president of the United
States. The salaries of leading
railroad officials range from i 15,000
to $150,000); compare this with,
from $50t)0 to $12,000 for inited
States government officials, 1)o
you catch the difference. The dan.
ger from railroad corporations now,
is their power to bribe, whereas,
the danger with government owner
ship would be the votes ot employ
ees, for the party in power. This
would be regulated by strict civil
s ervice rules as the army and pos
tal system is, and further, could
any sane person tear the votes of
seven hundred thousand men
r against thirteen millions?
The idea of governmental owner
Li ship is not a wild Populistic idea
as some would say, but is at sound
Sprinciple of government, as old as
the railroads themselves. Outside
- of America, there are no nations
a ot consequence but Turkey, Spain
s and England, that do not own
s wholly or in part their railroad sys
e tem.
e The countries owning their roads
I know nothing of the curse of dis
t crimination by which one industry
is built up at the expense of anoth
er ; towns and cities are built and
f destroyed at the pleasure of rail
road kings, and by which nlouopo
polies and trusts are drawing ruto
their coffers the whole wealth of
the country.
° Now a few of the arguments for
° government ownership briefly sta
teod.
The passenger rates could be re
duced to one half a cent per mile,
I and freight rates would be decreas
i ed in equal proportions.
The producer and consumer
would be equally benefitted by this
system.
Railroad advantages would ex
tend to every citizen in the Repub
lie, just as the postal system, which
is almost absolutely perfect.
Thecondition of employees would
be bettered by increased wages,
shorter hours, and freedom from ty
ranical control.
The people would save seven
hundred million dollars every year,
which is more than is spent for
bread and meat, and would be
enough to place a glittering gold
plate on every railroad track in
America.
The lives of enough people would
be saved to populate a whole dis
trict, and twenty towns like Natch
itoches.
Gambling, fraud and corruption
Swold be diminished, and the mor.
al condition of the nation propor.
tionately raised.
It would check the centralization
of wealth in the few hands, which
has destroyed every republic that
ever went down.
As Garfield said, "The people
must own the corporations, or the
corporations will own the people."
We welcome the era of peace on
earth-good will to men; and with
the Poet hopefully say,
"Ring out a slowly dying curse.
