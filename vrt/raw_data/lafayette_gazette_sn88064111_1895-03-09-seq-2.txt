to- LOTS OF CRANKS.
n. Times-Democrat.
ice In this age of Coxeys, Carl
le- Browns and "sockless" Simpsons
ce- we can look out for an abundance
rn- of cranks, and we have no. difficulty
iti- in finding them. The people are so
much demoralized that the cranks
of are in great luck politically, and not
a few of them are holding high
m- office, so that Coxey's candidacy
of for the Presidency does not seem as
ell, absurd as it otherwise would.
a It is in the State Legislatures,
ion however that the crank is showing
be- himself most conspicuous. We
is have already spoken of some of the
strange laws proposed-the regula
eir tion of chiropodists, the civil ser
vice examination of blacksmith,
fu- etc.-but these are nothing com
pared with several new bills now
under consideration.
Perhaps the worst crank in the
the lot is a member of the Connecticut
r's Legislature, who is strongly pres
to sing a bill which requires children's
ile names within three days of their
ed birth. They are usually named
he within that period, but occasional
tlp ly the selection is postponed a short'
:n- time; and this arouses the great
Ats but unexplained indignation of the
nd Connecticut legislator, who does
to not, however, give any reason wh3
ne his feelings are so lacerated by un
re named infants.
's" An Orgeon legislator proposes to ,
my place a heavy tax on all male per- i
s, sons wearing queues, this act being I
e, evidently aimed at the Chinese. r
ill An amendment is proposed to it,
at levying a tax on wigs also, and one ,
ss is about as reasonable as the other. t
m In Missouri, where the Legisla- s
ture is afflicted with a very moral
id spasm, a bill prohibiting the giving a
a away of pictures of actresses, etc., t
with papers of cigarettes, has been f;
presented on the ground that the t
r- cigarettes are bad enough in them- 1
=y selves, and that these pictures 0
'Y would entail injury to the morals, F
as the cigarettes do the health of
those who use them; and the mor
y als of the cigarette smokers, it is l
:y insisted, need especial looking after. f
It would take up too much space, b
however, to tell of all the cranky a
bills introduced in our several State C
Legislatures. They are of all kinds c
e and fashons, regulating everything,
the dress as well as the morals of
the people. The year will be long w
remembered as a remarkable one in c.
the matter of legislation, a year in- t}
deed of "spasms" and "isms." sc
S"Men Are Cheaper Than Shin- t
gles." rt
i1
In an article in the January num- a
sber of the AIrena on "The Sweating h4
System in Philadelphia," written by te
Rev. Frank M. Goodchild, the au- ec
r thor says: "One man was asked
to repair the roof over has worKmen. tr
r It was giving them rheumatism, R
rasthma and consumption. HFe ci
- said: 'Mlen are cheaper than shin- n
gles; no sooner does one drop out
- than a dozen are ready to take his ra
place.' " re
We do not intend to dwell upon a
the brutality of this expression. tri
The moan simply said what many ne
others think and do not say. Or if
they don't think it, they act upon S.
this theory. .The question for us Nt
is simply, Is it true that men are
really cheaper than shingles? Alas, Br
it is true Shingles cost money, Br,
men do not. Men can be had for o,
nothing. If a workman dies itca
does not cost his employer a single
cent to put another one in his place. For
During times of slavery that was -
different. A man had to be bought.
Economically speaking, free labor
is cheaper than slave labor. The
slave has to be maintained whether
he is worsing or not; the free la- Ac
borer gets nothing unless he is at
ork. The slave represente-I a
capital invested which had to be r
taken care of; the free laborer rep- senit
resents nothing. In our age an in- tent
dusttry cannot he ldeve\uchid with I.af::
slave labor. It is too dear.
the It recently happened in one of
a the counties of our State that a
nd, woman whose husband was, with
not his horse, killed by a railroad train
ice recovered to cents damages for her
rhy husband and 50o for the horse.
or- Probably because men are cheaper
in than shingles.-Amelican Noncon
, formist, Indianapolis.
Then and Now.
or- There was a ,time when he who would
ian keep informed of the' progress of knowledge,
nd the record of discovery and invention, and
the currents of human -thought, could and
ice indeed must rely chieflj if not wholly upon
owbooks. That day has passed. Books we
must .still read, as the crystal'ization and
Lie permanent embodiment of human thought
and knowledge. But to-day it is the news
paper, the magazine, the periodicil review,
ld upon which we must chiefly depend if we
.vould follow closely the intellectual move- I
tly ment of the day. And now a new difficult
th- has arisen. This newspaper and periodic
literature has become so multitudinous and I
bulky as to be a heavy burden to the busy
man or woman, while even the person who
has leisure and inclination to read widely
is often unable to get access to the current
publications. Especially in the smaller
arl cities, villages, and rural districts is the
lack of such opportunity felt. It is felt by
ins the clergyman, the teacher, the lawyer, the
ice physician, the merchant, the artisan, the
farmer and the cultured and thoughtful
ty practical literary question is: With all
so these and many other classes of persons the
uks great practical literary question is: How
can I best supplement my indispensible
lot home paper? It was to answer this ques
and meet this demand that PUBLIC OPIN- -
gh ION (now published in New York City)
.cy was founded nine years ago. It selects the
best, condenses it to the last degree, and
a serves it in convenient and attractive form.
s, GERMANY AND BIME TAL
ng LIS_.
,e New York World:
he The Reichtag at Berlin has
la- passed by an ovewhelming majority
r_ a resolution in favor of calling a
new international bimetallic confer
'- ence. The tact is significant.
The manner of its accomplishment
is not less so. Tfhe opposition was
he small and it came almost wholly b
ut from the Socialists and Radicals.
:s- Conservative opinion, including ti
that of men close to the govern
:ir ment, favored the resolution. Ger- h
ed many's adoption of gold monom
I_- etallism was a potent if not a deter- b
,rt mining factor in bringing about the d
at general disuse of silver as a full
he money metal. Germany's refusal d
es hitherto to consider proposal for a r
retracing of steps taken in this di- I
rection has been a principal ob
stacle in the way of that interna- i
tional agreement which alone can .1.
to maketeny form of bi:netallism safe. L
r- If this action of the Reichstag re
tg flects t-.e dominant German senti-t
e. ment, next bLi.:tallic confer
ence W htet under urech more
t' hoeful auspices ti;an the last one
IC did. 1V l ny and the United P
r. States a restoration of
a. silver under international agree
al inent, the nations embraced in the
Latin Union will naturally be in
g accord. Whatever E:ngl.nd's posi
tion may be this German change of
n front will make the next interna
e t'onal monetary conference very
much more interesting t:an the last -
one was.
