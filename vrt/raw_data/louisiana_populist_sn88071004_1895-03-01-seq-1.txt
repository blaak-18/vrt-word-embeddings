The friends of the Union Pacific
funding bill charge its defeat to
the Populist congressman from
Kansas, and the passage of the in
come tax law was clearly a victory
for the populists at the last session.
Every populist last Thursday vot
ed against the gold bond scheme
and it was defeated by their influ
ence, and as these are the most es
sential features passed on so far in
recent legislative propositions, we
have every reason for being proud
of our little band of reformers at
the national capital.--Chicago Sen
tincl.
Gen. A. J. Warner, president of
the bimetallic league, is agitating
the formation of a silver party.
Gen. Warner is off his base. He
oight just as well try and murder
the silver cause outright as to agi
tate the formation of a new party
on that basis. The People's party
is an unequivocal alive. party,
well organised and has a following
of some two million voters already.
Warner's idea ia simply suicidal,
and if carried out would prove that
sill~er had worse enemies in thuan
outside the ranks of its pretended
Mrlends.-Butte (Mo.) Bystander.

Old Man Tells His Hopeful How
- the Old Taritf Thing Work.
PIa, what is the tariff we hear so
much about .
To be exact it is a tax, an indi
re(t tax.
\\hat is the. dif'erentce betweenl a
direct ami an indirect tax :
Ah, my soni. thereby hangs a
tare.
'A tale
Yes, it is a long story, bult, as I
intend to make an attorney out of
v(o, I might just as well tell you
the whlioie truth about it.
\Vell what is it, pa ; I want to
hear it all!
Look around you at this luxuri
ois horme. Now compare it
with your U1ncle John's. We are
brothers. lie is naturally the
smarter of the two, At school he
was always ahead of mie. lie
t- bought a farm. I studied law.
Now see the difference. He and I
all his family work twelve months
of the year. We have more leis- 1
tire in a month than they in twelve. i
We go to Europe, they stay at
homne.
But pa, I wanted to know about
the tariff.
Yes, I know it, but I don't see
what your choice of occupation
has to t1o with the tariff. j
It has nothing, but the tariff
had a great deal to do with my I
selection of an occupation.
Why did it, pa f
Well, it is this way. All nations
have to raise revenue as it is call
ed to carry on the government.
Theoretically this should be done 1
by a direct tax.
Why should it, jia
Because it would be so much
cheaper.
You stChen a man walks up to
the treasurer's office and puts his
handi down in his pocket to pay his
share of the tax, he is apt to scru
tiniize pretty closely the uses to
which the money is put. lie would
resent extravagance at the polls
the next time he voted. His ideas
are, a government economically ad
ministered.
Isn't that right !
For him, yes. For us, no. All
governments are so administered
as to raise the revenue by au indi
rect tax. By so doing large
amounts are raised every year, that
are unnecessary. The voting away
of this surplus constitutes what is
known as the spoils of office.
But how does this aflect you, 1
pal
We'll get to that after a while. t
The government taxes every moan,
woman and child in this country
$7.70 a year. Now, if this was i
(lone directly it would cause a rev.
olution.
Why would it
Because if hpnestly administer.
ed it would not take over $4.00 a
head. The rest is stolen. Now,
this could not be done ulless we
had this tarifi question up.
Why not It
Well, here i3 Brown, so poor he b
can't buy a hen and chickens, yet n
by means of the tariff and the fi
8chemes it fosters, he is made to 3
pay his share of this heavy tax p
unknown to himself. d
Hlow can it be done b
Well it is done by so arranging i
thiuus that hie never gets this tax it
money into his hands. lie earns
it, but it is collected in various w
ways before it gets to him, just cl
how, I will not now take time to I
explain.
But, pa,- e
The rulers of every nation have 8
stdied carefully the problem of ct
how best to tax the people to the r
highest extent they will bear. Ours aI
have found the safest and surest n
method to be by means of a tariff.
I ought to say right here, that the w
rulers of every nation under the w
Isnu ar" wealthy men, known'now- w]
El ___ -~
a-days as a "the lmoney power." IIn
empires it sustains the Emperor.
In kingdoms the Kinc', and in re
)publics the leaders of tile two Ipar
io ties either inl or likely to be in pow
er.
- But this indirect tax, pa !
Exactly. The iunccessllry funds
a thus raised, are used to buy, bribe
and debauch enough voters to keep
a the system in vogue. Again, under
this tarift cloak a hundred legali
zed robbers limasqulerade anid ex
I ploit the people.
)t Exploit thecn !
u Fleece them, to be plain.
But to get to your case pa.
o Well, all right. I'm a candidato
for re-election to congress. We
i- need a harbor improvemenlt here
it that should cost $5040,t000. But I
e have introduced a bill calling for I
e :$2,00O,00H)0. In order to get elected
el I promised Smith the contract of
e doing the .job. lie prroiscd va- I
rions other men jobs on if, andi
1 they in turn still others so tlhat
s when the job is secured there will
b- be several hundred men \~ ho can
influence voters, enlgage ( <i it as i
t employes, contractors, sub-con- t
tractors, inspectors, etc. In other 4
t words men with light work and
heavy paly.
e How could you promise the job
n to Snith l )oni't they Ict such il
jobs to the lowest bidder I
Theoretically they do, but prac- I
y tically they don't. That is m;inaul 1
ged in ways too devious to explain i
nro T.
s Why do you ask for ý2,OOf(,0IN)
instead of $53M),000 O
Well, we expect to have our es
e timuate cut down about half.
But a million is twice too much,
p)a !
Ii Yes, but these light work and
heavy pay gentry must not be for
a gotten.
s But how can you get such a large
s approlprifationi through, pa I
We call it log-rolling the bill
u through. You see I have been
I preparing for this for some time.
8l ow, pa I
s Well, you see there are a great a
many other Imen in congress who
have axes to grind, as we call it or I
jobs to put through. Now in order I
to get my el,000,000 I hadl to vote r
for similar .jobs for a number orfl
other congressmen. Then I voted
for an Indian school that Congress- s
man B. was interested in. To be 4
brief. I voted for bridges for C., t
war ships for D., a big lamn for E., i
a higher tariff on shovels for F., at
lower one on fish for G., etc. All a
with the express understanding
that when the time comes they L
will vote for my bill.
But where does the tariff come
in, pal
I am just getting to that. Now, s
you see, we will vote away twice as b
much next March as would be re- b
quired if nothing was stolen. Now, h
we have found out by experience 1
that to discuss the tariff betore the
people is a little like waving a red 4
flag before an apgry bull. The t
hotter the' tariff discussion, the t
blinder the people are to our steal-. g
mngs. If you read the papers care
fully along the last days of next
March you will see that the appro- 1
priations are not made till the last a
days of the session. Then just
before adjournment we vote away tl
millions of dollars a minute. Now,
if we did not keep the fool voter's t,
eyes fastened on the tariff, they 9
would be apt to scrutinize too
closely our bills with jobs iu them. ,
I wouldn's have my $2,000,000 har- ,
bor bill come up for dlIaseuson t
early in the session for anything. a
So you see in order to prevent its m
coming up, I'll introduce a bill to ti
reduee or add to the tariff on some y
article, or what is better, our com
mittee will fiame a bill that will
consume all thie time, except what
we can profitably use somne other i
way. Finally at the very last end u
when its too late to examineb them, m
Il we'll rush it and its cousins and its
. sisters and its aunts right through.
SOf' couirse to get votes cnough Nwe
roust vote, for the jobs, put up by
railroads, telegraphs, manufactt
rerls, iminers, whisky distillers, su
gar rtefiiners, timber thieves, seal
Sowners, and a host of other fellows

r Then, pa this is why we have
- billion dollar colgresses, isn't it
Yes.
So we will c'evcr see ;a direct ta.x
will we pa'
\o never. The puwcars I t'. b,
will never allow it.
J Isn't this all wroen, pI!'
Yes; but as it is being dlnte wo
, must get into the swim.
Is this the reason you waiut I,c

The popular protest againast so
crecy in the bond sale has its clitctL
The text ot the secret contract ii
at last made public.
The secrecy was scandalous but
not surprising. The contract is not
one of which its authors should be
ot her-wise than ashamed.
It discredits the government
with-out any shadow of inecessity.
I t involves the secret sale of bonds
to a syndicate of bankers at a rate
rit below the market price, far small
er than might have been obtainedt
and at a rate of interest which is
grotesquely out of proportion tot
that with which Eugland and
France, with far smaller rcsources
and ftar larger debts, borrow moaey
without difficulty.
At the time when the socret nec
gotiation was made United States
4 per cents were worth over 110 inv
the open market. Yet the admin-..
istration sold to this syndic.rte of
bankers $62,000,000 of 4 per cents
at about 104
Surely some explanation should
be given of this remarkable fact.
The 4 per cents which were then
selling at 110 have only twelve.
years to run. Those sold to the,
syndicate have thirty years of life,
before them. If the twelve-year
bonds are worth 110 the thirty-year
issue should have sold for about
110. Why was it sold atl104
Again, the value of government
4 per cents is so certain and fixed.
that even this surprising act of
the treasury in discredit of the.
government has not lowered the
market price. The old 4's, with
only twelveyears to run, are still.
ieadlily salable in the open market
at 110 and above.
Why did it not denmanaltnd gt
the market paice, 119, or at the
very worst the 110 at which buyers
take the older and less -valuable
bonds
Why did it not sell these bon:
In the open market? Why did it
waste the substance of the people
to the extent of many milliolls,'.
and above all why did the tre4ury
make itself the agent for impais.ii g"
