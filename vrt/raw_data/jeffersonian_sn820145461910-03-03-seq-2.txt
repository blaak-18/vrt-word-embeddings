NEWS OF THE FARMERS’ UNION
ALABAMA FARMERS DISAP
PROVE OF OFFICIALS NEG
LIGENCE.
Dear Sir: —The members of Mc-
Shan Local, No. 550, desire to ex
press their disapproval of the con
duct of some of the members of the
Georgia and Texas Union in regard
to charges made by Hon. Thomas E.
Watson.
The charges have been openly
made and should be openly met.
Knowing that whatever affects one
member of the body affects the
whole: We therefore call on our
National President, C. S. Barrett, to
openly investigate these charges, and
the result be published.
We further desire to thank Mr.
Watson for his unselfish interest in
keeping us posted of the wrong-do
ings of some of our officials. We are
fully aware that Mr. Watson is able
to push this fight without our aid,
but we do know that an occasional
amen helps even a strong man in his
prayers. So we are sending this for
publication in The Jeffersonian at
Thomson, Ga., and will send a copy
to our own State paper, the Union
Guide, at Birmingham, Ala., and re
tain a copy at home.

Adamson, to make every effort and
use every influence to have this Con

MR. FARMER, DOES THIS MEAN
YOU? ASKS A FARMER’S
WIFE.
Dear Sir: —Your talk on the white
slave question is all right as to the
factories making slaves of their em
ployees, but w r hat about the slavery
going on in private homes, where the
sons of the farmers are compelled to
go into the fields and work at a ten
der age, when their demands are
greater than their strength; denied
the privilege of a common school
education, except a three months’
term in the winter; with scant cloth
ing, and with scarcely enough food to
give them strength to walk through
the snow to the school-house two
miles distant; kept in this condition
until the mortgage is lifted from the
home by their efforts, and they be
come of age, then sent out into the
world with nothing for their labor,
except curses because they didn’t
earn more. The father left in com
fortable circumstances, with one son
yet at home to be served as were
the others. Because of lack of edu
cation they are unable to secure de
sirable employment, so their lives
will be hard. Talk about monopolies
—I think this is the most cruel one
existing.
A farmer’s wife,
MRS. C. J. W.
Dear Sir:—l have just finished
reading this week’s Jeffersonian, and
I think it is the greatest paper I ever
read.
I am a member of the Farmers’
Union and I am glad that we,
through your paper, have a chance
of hearing of some of the doings
“behind closed doors’’ in regard to
things that they don’t want us,
the rank and file, to hear the straight
about. The men “higher up’’ don’t
want us to even mention in our Lo
cals any of the charges brought by
you, or any one else, in regard to
their conduct, or, rather, miscon
duct, until we make an investigation,
through headquarters, of course.
Then they would have a chance to fix
it up to suit themselves, as they did
that Galveston resolution.
Some may think that you will tear
down the Union by your exposures,
but I say that if weeding out the vic
ious and corrupt part of it will tear
it down, just let ’er go.
I think it is very necessary for the
farmers to organize and cooperate,
and I think the Union is doing a
great and glorious work in spite of
Duck, Boodlehunter, Ladson, and
others of their stripe.
Let us look well to our leaders,
and strive to put the best we have
at the head of our organization.
I am also a rural letter carrier
and, of course, am interested in
everything pertaining to the service.
I think if Congress could be
brought to a full realization of what
the R. F. D. means to the twenty mil
lions of people it serves, and the
hardships endured by the faithful
carriers, they would be willing to
give us an increase in salary; at
least sufficient for horse hire and
maintenance, as it is a struggle for
us to make both ends meet on our
present salary, with food for man
and beast at the present high prices.
Yours in the fight on the man
“Higher Up’’,
T. W. MCDONALD.

to have a Watson knife. You’ll find

Union News had to say about men
who have piled up wealth and then
drift away from the people. I think
it is a shame. I have taken the
Farmers’ Union News, but I don’t
want any of it in mine. I would
not have it free of charge.

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY PU
LASKI CO. FARMERS’ UNION.
I herewith send you copy of reso
lutions adopted at our regular meet
ing on February 16th.
Whereas, there is now pending be
fore our National Congress a bill to
establish the parcels post, also a bill
to prohibit the gambling in farm
products by exchanges, etc.,
Resolved Ist, That we, the F. E.
and N. of A. of Pulaski county, as
sembled, do hereby memoralize our
Congressman, Hon. D. M. Hughes,
and our United States Senators, Hon.
A. O. Bacon and A. S. Clay, by re
questing them to use every honor
able means within their power to
have said measures enacted into law,
believing, as we do, that said laws
will be conducive to the best inter
ests of the people of these United
States.
2d. That they, and each of them,
stand firmly and unalterably against
any measure seeking to establish the
merchant marine, believing, as we
do, that this is only another name
for the VILLIANOUS ship subsidy
STEAL sought to be established by
and in the interest of the few (i. e.,
the syndicates) and the
masses of the American people.
3d. That these resolutions be
spread upon our minutes and a copy
be sent to Hon. D. M. Hughes, Hon.
A. O. Bacon, A. S. Clay, and the
Farmers’ Union News and Watson’s
Jeffersonian, with a request for pub
lication.
The above was adopted by a unani
mous vote.

GEORGIA FARMERS WILL CARE
FOR GEORGIA’S POOR.
Resolved, That we, the members
of Kelly Creek Local Union No. 443,
stand ever ready with a helping hand
for such unfortunate people as Law
rence Bird and his mother, and ask
all sister Locals to do as we have
done —take action, and send them
ten cents apiece.
This done in open session 19th of
February, 1910.
R. H. GARRETT, Sec.
Carrollton, Ga., Rt. 6.
Have you sent in your pledge of
the number of new subscribers you
will send to The Jeffs in 1910?
WHAT THE NEW POSTAGE RATE
MEANS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I would like
to drop a few thoughts to your read
ers through your valuable paper, the
weekly Jeffersonian.
I have learned that there is a
conspiracy in our national depart
ment at Washington, D. C., to inter
fere with our postal service, to .wit:
The new Taft tax of 50 cents to
$2.00 a year upon each periodical
that comes into our homes.
Shall the postoflice be run in the
interest of the people or for the
benefit of express companies, rail
roads and the American News Com
pany?
These interests stand to make at
least.sloo,ooo,ooo a year if Congress
so restricts the postoffice as to prac
tically exclude periodicals from the
mails, force all merchandise to go
by express, and abolish rural de
livery.
A hint to the wise is sufficient. We
can prevent this terrible graft and
outrage against the people if we will
go at it in earnest and determina
tion. Let each reader of The Jeffer
sonian write to his Congressman and
Senator and ask them to fight the
proposition in Congress. Get up a
petition and have all your neighbors
sign it and send it to your Congress
man and ask him to present it to the
House*.and Senate. Something like
this:
We protest against the proposed
tax on periodicals; continue the R.
F. D., improve the postal service, j
provide local parcels post, cut down I
excessive payments to railroads for J
carrying mails, supply postal cur-"
rency, and bring the postoffice up-to
date.
Express those ideas in your own
words if you can do it better.
Let our voices he heard at once.
I have got a petition of forty sign
ers, all made today; will forward it
at once. You can do as well. Do it
now. • ,
Respectfully submitted.

Cisco, Texas.
WILL YOU HELP?
. There is a lady at Rockingham,
Georgia, who has proved herself a
good friend to The Jeffersonians by
taking subscriptions and helping to
interest her neighbors in the maga
zine and weekly. She is blind; but
has been self-supporting ever since
her school days at the Georgia Acad
emy for the Blind. Not long ago, her
piano, the source of her living, was
broken in such away as to be use
less; and she must have another one.
She offers for sale to the readers of
The Jeffersonian two little poems,
“Never Fading Treasure” and “Time
Enough Yet”. The former was sug
gested by an incident which was re
lated to her by a minister in Willa
coochee, Georgia.
If you will help a worthy lady,
send a dime to The Jeffersonians,
Thomson, Ga., or to Miss Sara Ab
bott, R. F. D. 1, Rockingham, Ga.,
and the poems will be mailed to you.
