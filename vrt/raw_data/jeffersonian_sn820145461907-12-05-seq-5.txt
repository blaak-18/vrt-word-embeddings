In all these movements there is in
finite encouragement. The labor un
ions, the farmers’ organizations and •
the kindred reform bodies that under
their own banners are fighting the
battles of the people are but various
branches of the greater army that
eventually is to wage the supremo
struggle for human rights. For each
and all of them we have but a word
of fraternal cheer. Our only oppo
sition is to the stock exchange gamb
lers, who are subverting democracy
and robbing mankind. There are in
reality two forces’in our country—
those who stand for the kings of dis
honest finance, and those who stand
for the equal rights of all. Sooner
or later every man must ally himself
under one standard or the other, and
it is to that end that the People’s
Party sounds the call to action.
Gambling on margins should be pro
hibited by law. Betting on the prices
of stocks and on the necessities of
life not only possesses all the evils
of other sorts of gaming, but adds
that of being a disturber of com
merce and industry. This criminal
spirit of speculation has honeycombed
our banks and demoralized our rail-
Toada, and finally, in the midst of
universal prosperity, is plunging oar
country into a panic that is brin 7
ing distress and suffering to all. With
11ns object lesson bes >re their ey- 1.
the American people will fail in their
duty if they do not correct the finan
cial system, and end the iniquity of
stock gambling once and forever.
And with the accomplishment of
these results, the People's Party will
be content. It cares not who does the
work so long as the work is done.
But until all its principles are enacted
into law it proposes to continue the
fight. All soldiers of truth for her
sake it invites to join its ranks.
Those who can turn their backs on
the fleshpots and fight for right be
cause it is right are ever welcome.
We are content to stand as we have
stood since the birth of our party,
holding aloft the triune banner of
reform—money, land and transporta
tion—which includes transmission of
intelligence.
The people’s money; the people's
land; the people’s transportation; the
people’s government.
It is time for a marshalling of the
forces. It is time to proclaim that
the reign of Mammon is ended, and
that we are ready to inaugurate R
reign of man. The hour at last has
struck for the formation of a great
independent political movement, free
from the bossism and corruption of
both old parties and based on the
fundamental and eternal truth of the
People’s Party. Not only are the
principles winning the nation, but
the time has arrived for the resur
rection of the party, that will put
these principles into practice. To
this end let us reassemble our
forces and re-form our lines.
All who are ready for independent
political action, who believe in a
money issued and controlled by the
government instead of by the banks
and the stock gamblers, who believe
in public utilities being owned by the
public, who believe in the rights of
these toilers and the people’s rule
through direct legislation, are cordial
ly invited to join our ranks and to
assist in electing delegates to our
national oonrsntioa.
WATSON’S WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
A NEW TRIUMVIRATE FOR THE
PEOPLE.
An article by “Dixit” in the
Weekly Jeffersonian October 24, sug
gesting that the three gieat reform
leaders, Wm. J. Bryan, Wm. R.
Hearst and Thomas E. Watson, unite
their forces in one great party, should
meet with the approval of everyone
who has the real interests of the peo
ple at heart.
A new party, embodying the prin
ciples of Thomas Jefferson, and firm
ly rooted in the constitution, has al
ready been formed under the leader
ship of Wm. Randolph Hearst —a
party that must be reckoned with in
the coming campaign of 1908.
It behooves the Populists in their
coming conference to consider well
whether they will avail themselves of
this opportunity to unite with the
League in this new people ’9 party- -
whose fundamental truths are, “Al!
men are created equal . and arc
endowed by their Creator with cer
tain inalienable rights . . . life, lib
erty and the pursuit of happiness,”
as in our first 11 Declaration of In
dependence,” and therefore appro
priately named, The Independence
League I
In a measure, Thomas E Watson
is sponsor for this party.
At the great municipal ownership
meeting of April, 1905, held in New
York City, in memorable old Cooper
Union, his speech—notable among
ethers —made a profound impression;
and helped to bring about the Munic
ipal Reform Alliance, which has since
crystallized into the Independence
League. As an auditor on that oc
casion, I well remember the unstint
ed praise given to Mr. Hearst. To
quote Mr. Watson’s own words:
“There is another who deserves spe
cial mention here tonight An un
assuming, modest man —a mere
talk-factory, not a man whose pun
pose finds its only life in words, to
die away with the echo of those
words; but a man who for a dozen
years has intrepidly championed the
cause of the people; and who at Chi
cago was in the thick of the fight.
It would be rank injustice not to sav
that the whole country owes recogni
tion and applause to William Ran
dolph Hearst. ’ ’
During the course of this speech
Mr. Watson also said: “To redeem
New York, to liberate public proper
ty from the clutches of private cor
porations, I am ready to step into the
ranks, under the leaderanip of any
honest man who is devo+otl to prin
ciple.”
The New York mayoraltv campaign
in 1905 is well known; and the re
sults of that stolen election will go
down in history with those two oth
er infamous political thefts, viz.:
In 1876, when the electoral college
counted cut Tilden for the presiden
cy; and again, twenty years later,
when the same tactics were employed
in counting out William Jennfngs
Bryan! In 1906 the Independence
League, uniting with the best ele
ments of the democratic party in New
York, were victorious, though their
leadership was deprived of the fruits
thereof. The results of this fall’s
election prove the growing strength
of the League. With decided victo
ries in Boston and San Francisco,
and the large vote polled for oourt
of appeals by the Letfua alone, in
New York City, and acknowledged
by the New York press —the outlook
is very encouraging for future victo
ries.
Arthur Brisbane, one of the most
brilliant writers of the country, said
in an interview for the New York
World in 1906: “Hearst is going
to succeed because sincerity and in
telligence combined do not fail in
the long run. And those who support
him now in the beginning of his po
litical career will be pioneers in a
movement for genuine conservative
popular government, free from the
dangerous experiments of irresponsi
ble theorists and free from the vicious
scheming of selfish monopolists.
Hearst stands for Americanism in
government. And Americanism is not
yet a failure, despite the efforts of
anarchy at the top and at the bot
tom of society to make it fail.”
“A word to the wise” should be
sufficient to cause the Populists and
all earnest members of true Jeffer
sonian Democracy, throughout the
land, to pause and reflect before tak
ing decided and final action for the
next campaign in 1908.

ADVICE, WHICH YOU MAY
CONSIDER.
Everybody that is not getting Wat
son’s Jeffersonian Magazine, of At
lanta, Ga., is missing the very cream
of current journalism. “Best in the
South,” is too small and provincial a
category; whatever Tom Watson
writes goes right up into the best
anywhere class. It is true he has
views. Almost anybody is subject to
this limitation at times. But he can’t
help it—and he does express them so
well. The liveliness of a Watson
paragraph is certainly not excelled,
if, indeed, it is equalled by anybody
else’s we happen to know of —not
even by Collier’s.
And these few remarks, by the
way, are not intended as an ad. for
Watson’s, but merely as a good tv n
to our readers. If they will read t
few numbers of the Watson’s Jeffer
sonian, of France, or his Life of
Thomas Jefferson, or almost anything
else he has written, and then not
heartily’ agree with us and be much
obliged for the tip, we will cheerful
ly refund this entire paragraph. If
a man has time to read only so much
he ought to take his home paper,
Watson’s, Collier’s, McClures and the
Louisiana School Review, and let the
rest go.—Louisiana School Review.
HE KNEW HIS FATHER.
“Suppose,” said a father to hu
little boy, “you have half an apple
and I give you another half. How
much have you?”
‘‘A whole apple,” said the boy.
“Well,” continued the father,
“suppose you had a half dollar and
I gave you another half dollar. What
would you have then?”
“A lit,” promptly answered the
boy. _
