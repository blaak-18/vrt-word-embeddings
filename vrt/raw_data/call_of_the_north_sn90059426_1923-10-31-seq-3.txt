Menace of Modern Immigration
God never imposes imsuperable bur
dens and obstacles upon his children.
It is a divine law, over which no mun
dane court has jurisdiction, that for
every crucial complexity affecting
humanity there is a master key to its
solution. But the spiritual purpose
stops there. Given the means, men
and women must attend to their own
temporal salvation and safety. Other
wise civilization itself pays the tra
gic price of failure. Without com
prehension and constructiveness on
the part of the people, in time a single
great problem may become a con
suming catastrophe.
Today this country is acutely con
fronted by one outstanding problem
beside which all other national diffi
culties •re transient and trivial.
Properly to measure the manacing
proportions of this problem, to deter
mine and apply the just and lasting
remedy, is the supreme task of all
true Americans.
Our cause is true Americanism.
This means in all vital things a su
perior Christian civilization for Amer
ica. Our destiny is the common wel
fare, materially and mentally, phy
sically and spiritually, upon a plane
high above any mankind has ever
known. We have the heritage, the re
sources, the opportunity, for the ac
hievment of* the noblest and best in
human happiness and human power.
Our crusade has that glorious goal.
We would attain and forever hold a
national pre-eminence, not in selfish
ness or vanity, but because therein
lies the greatest usefulness both for
ourselves and to the world.
I am not unmindful of many in
fluences that retard the ideals of our
Republic; but this fundamental to
them all; that in every phase and in
terdependent relations of mankind in
commerce and school and state, it is
the composite people that ultimately
prevail. Their common character,
their capacity, the mean denominator
of their motives, fix the standard.
This or that smaller‘superior element
may for brief moments predominate
and give upward direction to national
tendencies, but finally comes the in
exorable level of the mass. That is
inevitable. It is God’s law. Every
minute and every million years of hu
man history prove it. There is no
escape from that conclusion, nor any
possible evasion of its consequences.
All else, other than the inherent or
acquired common character of the na
tional life—the composition of our
people—is relatively unimportant.
Our public institutions may become
perverted, or inadequately keep pace
with evolution in other fields; they
can always and quickly be altered to
conform to ancient principles and
modern needs.
Political issues may exist, or arise,
to try and test our statesmanship.
There may come dark, depressing per
iods of prostituted public powers; but
such problems are comparatively
transient and trivial. In a single de
cade it would be possible completely
to change both elections and legisla
tion, to provide an entirely different
order of public service, from commis
sioners to cabinet.
Even with economic conditions, it
is the same. No industrial injustice,
however entrenched or complicated,
could long withstand the mighty on
slaught of public opinion based upon,
and having for its object, the right
remedial action.
I recognize fully the political, gov
ernmental, economic and social prob
lems of this generation. Ido not de
precate their pressing importance
But the time has come to look far be
yond any or all of them to this great
er American problem of our composite
people. That is the bed-rock of every
national danger, and hope. It is fund
amental to and of everything that
makes up the national life. It is not
transient nor elastic. The streams of
population that have been and are
pouring in upon us are ages old in
racial, character and capacity. Where
a decade might suffice for the solution
of any single passing evil, centuries
and cycles of time would be required
to affect materially a vital alteration
of the mould in which God has fash
ioned whole races of people.
We are the melting pot of the
world, a problem and a responsibility
faced by no other people. Into it has
been poured, almost promiscously,
perhaps in recent years designedly,
every dross ingredient of citizenship
that the earth produpes. The good and
the bad have haphazardly been thrown
together, to be turned out as the na
tion's human / metal under the same
conditions. No account has been tak
en of the different degrees of refine
ment required, nor of the unmer
geability of basicly conflicting ele
ments.
Out of it, and from no other source,
must come national strength or weak
ness—in the end. our success or failure
as a Republic.
This problem is far more complicat
ed and menacing today than in any
previous period. The immigrant
stream is monthly more and more in-

ferior, as I shall show by indisputable
facts and figures. But it is not yet
too late to takd constructive steps to
prevent this melting pot from becom
ing a cauldron of chaos and disaster
for the nation.
Within the year Congress will en
act a new immigration law. The
present statute expires by limitation
oh the first of next July. I propose,
therefore, that we now take stock of
the national situation with respect to
this all-important matter of he com
position of our people and determine,
as God intends we shall in all funda
mental difficulties, what permanent
policy will best promote our own civil
ization and that of the world.
In the consideration of a subject
so interwoven with our destiny, we
should know exactly every vital fact
and influence bearing upon it. I have
undertaken, humbly and without bias
of any kind, to make such a compre
hensive study of our immigration
problem. It involved statistics from a
thousand original sources, figures al
ways complex and often contradictory.
It meant much new information con
cerning our history and that of the
world. There had to be an up-to-date
appraisal of all our assets and liabil
ities in human form. It was quite im
possible to comprehend our past,
present and future situation without
applying to our population all the es
tablished truth with respect to an
thropology. A failure to take into
account family strains, racial char
acteristics and cultures would have
been fatal to correct conclusion. Eu
genics entered into it, not here and
there, but everywhere, because the
final Americanization of this country
will be accomplished only through in
termarriage, and we must understand
fully the extent to which mixed par
entage is possible and how it con
tributes to good or bad results. From
beginning to end, this survey involv
ed government and politics and eco
nomics and religion. Social values,
not those associated with the four
hundred, but the social values that
concern the hundred millions, had to
be analyzed and catalogued as whole
some or detrimental to democracy.
Figuratively I had to enter thousands
and thousands of homes and then in
terpret each and every discovery in
terms of national advancement or re
trogression. In short, this subject
takes in everything. It means every
thing to America.
Racial, National and Social Values
In 1920, when the last census was
taken, this country had a combined
population of 105,710,620. We must
have standards by which to judge
every element of our humanity, but
first let me give you a bird’s eye pic
ture of the American people, reduced
to racial, national and social values.
Those in the United States
who were born abroad
number 13,712,745
Those born here of foreign
parentage include 15,694,539
Those born here of mixed
alien and native stock
number 6,991,665
A total of first and second
generation white foreign
ers reaching 36,398,958
The negro race has grown
to 10,463,131
Indians, Orientals and Asia
tics number 426,574
We had, then, in 1920, alien
and colored peoples aggre
gating 47,288,663
At the same* time the na
tive white Americans or
original stock, including
many descended directly
and not very distantly
from immigrants number
ed 68,421,957
Viewed strictly in terms or racial
and national origin, the present popu
lation of the United States is much
less than half, perhaps little more
than a third, of native Anglo-Saxon
stock.
Could we stop with that comparison,
serious as it is by reason of recent
changes in the character of our immi
gration, the situation would not be 6o
alarming, but there are several other
substantial subtractions to be made
before arriving at the net worth of
the American people. Not pausing at
this point to present details, we have
in this country today—
Illiterates to the almost un
believable number of .... 4,931,905
Mentally and physically dis
eased persons totalling
more than 5,000,000
Paupers and dependents, at
least 100,000
Criminals, in institutions*
with hundreds of thou
sands more at large 163,889
A total of social inade
quate reaching 10,195,794
It is incontrovertible that the eat*
188 CALL OP THE NORTH
tent of illiteracy, insanity, disease,
dependency and crime would be grave
ly portentious, if we had no immigra
tion crisis to consider. One in ten of
our people are socially inadequate.
That number at least, instead of be
ing able to carry their part of the
public load and contribute to the com?
mon welfare, are a heavy, dangerous
incumbrance upon the body politic.
And we should not forget that, while
a much larger proportion of social
inadeguates are to be found in immi
grant stock, probably four millions
of native Americans are outstanding
ly deficient mentally, physically or
morally.
Leaving out of account the present
dilluting and often polluting streams
of population from abroad, and elim
inating our own' “inadequate,” it is
undeniable that we have not more
than thirty-five million one-hundred
percent Americans—men, women and
children—perhaps thirty million
would be the limit. Of course I am
here using that phrase to describe po
tential personal and not public qual
ities. Upon these three or four in
ten must we largely depend for the
predominant and perpetuity of real
Americanism in this country.
The Old Immigration And The New
With that picture in mind, let us
proceed to examine the quantity and
quality of the immigrant streams.
I have done this without prejudice,
preconceived attitude. There
is no hatred in my heart for any in
dividual, nationality or race upon the
face of the earth today. I love all
humanity; for that reason my su
preme love is for America. The full
est, most effective, expression of that
love lies in the fulfillment of her des
tiny. I believe that the safe-guarding
of sacred traditions, the realization of
fundamental ideals of human welfare,
can be accomplished only by keeping
our citizenship at the highest level of
intelligence and health and virtue.
If we are not successful, socially and
governmentally, mankind everywhere
will suffer and have heavier burdens
to bear. Therefore, I stand for the
survival of the fittest in this nation
because that means material and
moral blessings for all the world.
In the beginning of the national
life, and for long years after, our
policy was rightly that of the open
door. The gates were always ajar.
Those who would might come. Mill
ions did come—the best the earth had
to offer—Huguenot and Vavalier and
Puritan. No mercenary motive
brought them to our shores. They
possessed limitless courage. They
sought no favors that their own la
bors could not bestow. They wanted
an enduring freedom founded upon
their traditional reverence for law.
They built chapels and congresses and
chanceries. Later, through immigra
tion, that kind of opportunity beckon
ed to kindred humanity in northwest
ern Europe. Likewise they came and
established homes. Into those homes
we gladly gave our sons and daugh
ters, and as freely did they enter ours
to remain forever as husbands and
wives. There was complete, har
monious merging, hindered by no ob
stacle that God or man could reason
ably impose. Out of all that grew the
America of the last generation—pros
perous and proud, pure and patriotic.
Then, suddenly, the character of
our immigration changed. The cources
of our citizenship became radically
different. There was a fundamental
inferiority of racial and national
strains. The Anglo-Saxon, the Scand
inavian and the Teuton began to re
cede, with an overwhelming prepond
erance of peoples like the Slav, the
Latin, and the Greek.
From 1820 to 1923, a grand total of
35,192,224 immigrants came to this
country. By 1914, when the European
turmoil engulfed the world in trage
dy, the annual influx was 1,218,480.
What part of this mighty flood of
alien peoples was desirable? Upon
that point, I quote from “The Immi
gration Problem,” a book by Prof.
Jeremiah W, Jenks and Mrs. W. Jett
Lauck, as follows:
“A study of the immigration in the
United States, from the time that our
immigration began in 1819, to date 1 ,
shows a change in, the character of
the immigration as well as in its ex
tent. During the last twenty-five to
thirty years so marked has been the
change in the type of immigrants that
it is convient to classify our immi
gration as the old, that is, the immi
grants prior to 1883, and the new,
namely, those coming since that date.
The former class includes primarily
immigrants from England, Ireland,
Scotland, Wales, Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.
These countries funrnished some 95
per cent of the immigrants coming
into this country before 1883. In
1907, 81 per cent of the European im
migrants, including Syrians, came
from Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria,
Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Poland,
Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia,
Spain, Syria, and Turkey.”
During the fourteen years ending
with the World War period—l9ol to
1914—our population was increased
fully thirteen per cent by immigra
tion, the exact number being 12,928,-
517. Since 1820, Europe and the rest
of the world had been sending us, in
creasingly, of their peoples. Yet in
those fourteen years, which are a
part of our generation—not remote,
but immediate, not even yesterday,
but today in every vital effect and
influence—the immigrant blood was
40.5 per cent of the grand total for
the entire ninety-five years up to.
1914; and at this peak but 19 per
cent was coming from the sources
that helped to make our nation what
it is, while 81 per cent represented
racial strains and standards com
pletely incompatible with* our Amer
ican conception of social and public
life.
Let me quote again from Jenks and
Lauck, both of whom had a large
share in the work of the United
States Immigration Commission in
1910. They say:
“The change in the character of
the immigration is especially marked
by the fact that during the last few
years more immigrants have come
from any one of the three countries
of Austria-Hungary, Italy or Russia
than from all of the North European
countries taken together that for
merly furnished the bulk of Euro
pean immigrants.”
Foreigns Elements Sectionalized l
The resulting problem of assimila
tion cannot be measured by the 58
millions of native whites as against
the 47 millions of alien and colored
stock. The flood of inferior people
sweeping across the Atlantic as in
former ages they overran the plains
and valleys of the Old World has not
been at all evenly distributed. The
South is almost untouched by immi
gration. It is the the North
and West that have received he inun
dation.
In these three great sections of
the country—
The foreign-born whites
number 12,865,562
The whites of direct foreign
ancestry number 21,233,165
A total of 34,098,727
In the same sections native
born whites number 0n1y.36,589,974
For practically every white Amer
ican in the East, North and West,
there is a corresponding person born
abroad, or whose parents, one or
both, were born abroad.
Even that vital fact does not in
clude all the menacing truth, because
an overwhelming proportion of re
cent immigration is massed in cities
and industrial centers.
We see, therefore, that the South
is reasonably free of alien influence,
but that section has the bulk of the
black race. In the East and North
east particularly do we find a con
centration of equally unassimilable
foreign elements, not at all the de
sirable kinds that abound on the
prairies of the middle West. To
gether, the South with its negro
problem, and the New York-New
England section with its hordes of
inferior immigrants, are largely re
sponsible for much of the political
prostitution that is now a curse to
our country.
The Test of Americanism
My friends, as I said, we must
have standards by which present and
future Americanism may justly be
judged. Otherwise these immigra
tion facts will be futile and conclu
sions of little consequence. There are
certain vital requirements to be met,
if our citizenship is to measure up
and be maintained in harmony with
the ideals of the Republic. And I
venture the hope, nay, more, I make
the prophecy, that this great organ
ization will never for an instant lay
down its armor or sheath its sword
until all of them have been lastingly
achieved. These are:
(1) Education. The first and most
important duty of a nation is the
training of its boys and girls for
economic, civic and social life. An
illiterate is always a national lia
bility. Individually he or she is se
riously handicapped; as a class all
those deficient in mental develop
ment do not and cannot contribute to
the common welfare; instead they are
in all ways an added burden upon the
public.
Six per cent of our present popu
lation of youth and adult are unable
even to read and write.
That is not the American standard.
It is the average of illiteracy, with
immigrants included. The whole
number of uneducated native whites
in this country is 1,242,572, or two
per cent. Eight hundred and ninety
thousand of them are in the South
ern states, and they are mostly
“mountain whites.” For the rest of
the nation the average would be con
siderably below one per cent.
Among foreign-borti whites the il
literates are IS.I per cent.
Negro illiterates are 22.9 per cent.
Of the old immigration, the North-
western European kind, only 2.7 per
cent could not read and write when
admitted to our gates, while the pro
portion among the modern type of
immigrants averaged 35.8 per cent.
During the years from 1899 to 1909,
when the flood came largely from
Southern and Eastern Europe, of the
7,199,061 immigrants, 14 years of
age add over, 1,918,825 were illiterate,
a otal of 26.7 per cent.
To give an exact, specific and ap
palling illustration, the state of New
Jersey in 1920 had 127,661 illiterates,
of whom 111,595 were foreign born.
Returning to our recent immigra
tion, the lowest percentage of illi
teracy was among Scandinavians,
that being only four-tenths of one
per cent. Next came the Scotch with
seven-tenths. The English ranked
third, their per cent being one and
one-tenth. Other nationalities with
less than five per cent of illiterates
were Finnish, Bohemians, Welsh,
Irish and Dutch. The French and
Germans were slightly over five per
cent.
The highest percentage of illiter
acy was among Portuguese at 68.2.
Other nationalities were as follows:
Turkish, 58.9; South Italians, 54.2;
Syrians, 54.1; Rutherianse, 51; Lith
uanians, 48.8; Bulgarians, 41.8; Dal
mations, 41.3; Russians 38.5; Croa
tians, 36.4; Polish, 35.4; Rumanians,
34.7; Greeks, 27; Hebrews, 25.7;
Slovaks, 24.3; and Armenians, 24.1.
The average for this new immigra
tion was the figure I have given—35.8
per cent. ,
That is a staggering proportion—
about three in ten among immigrants
as compared with less than one in
each hundred of native Americans
throughout most of the country.
All these alarming facts relate to
the very rudiments of education—the
common grade school kind.
In 1917, the literacy test was put
into our immigration laws. Improve
ment has resulted, but what had al
ready happened could not be thus un
done. The densely ignorant who were
admitted before that date will remain
a life-long drag upon Americanism.
I submit that this nation should at
once take steps adequately, universal
ly, to provide for the education of her
children, both native and adopted. As
I shall show in discussing the public
health, mental deficiency has become
so prevalent as to be postively menac
ing. With hundreds of
perhaps millions, it is now undeniably
a matter of heredity. We must have
a compulsory educational system to
reach and uplift every future qitizen.
It must be publicly sponsored and
paid for, without a single parochial
exception. There should be#i Cabinet
Department of Education, second to
none in its public importance.
(2) Health. This is,quite as fun
damental as education. Mental fit
ness for citizenship is not possible
without physical wholesomeness and
stamina. The two go together.
Failure in either field brings the in
evitable blight of social inadequates,
with an ever increasing measure of
both private and public burdens.
Mankind is afflicted with many dis
eases, but I speak now only of those
which are constitutional, inherent in
the blood, often incurable, and recog
nized by scientists as causing the
almost complete incapacity of their
victims.
,The most insidious of these groups
in their effect upon our citizenship
are the nervous and mental maladies,
such as insanity, epilepsy, and, most
wide-spread and the least recognized
of all, mental deficiency.
Venereal diseases are repugnant
and terrible. They are often com
municable to the innocent. They are
transmissable through heredity. They
impose indirect moral, mental and
physical penalties that no stretch of
the imagination can measure, because
finite wisdom cannot penetrate the
ages yet to come.
Consumption and cancer, alcoholism,
drug addiction and blindness —these
also are great hereditary diseases we
should consider. They lower, and in
most cases destroy, the , citizenship
potentialities of those afflicted; they
menace the healthy; they imperil our
future Americanism.
No other part of this study has so
depressed me. I am trying to en
compass generations in my picture,
because generations in a nation should
be as days to an individual. Viewing
our situation thus, I stand appalled
at the gigantic evil powers of the
organic diseases that are slowly sap
ping the national strength. And the
part the recent immigrant has play
ed and is playing in this terrible
tragedy gives it primary pertinency
in that connection.
Do you know that among 2,754,000
conscripted men, between the ages of
18 and 30, the very cream of our
population, there were found 348,000
inheritable diseases ? Here among
the husbands of our daughters, the
fathers of our future citizens, at the
period of manhood’s greatest sound
ness and vigor, were one in every
eight with tainted blood and already
impoverished physical power. The
percentage was exactly 12.8—that
proportion was socially, and what is
even more important, eugenicly in
adequate.
In seeking light on this health
aspect, I have examined many au
thorities. The result has been volu
minous and terrifyingly illuminating.
Some time I hope for an opportunity
to present the subject in detail. On
this occasion of course I cannot do
more than summarize.
The government has published a
statistical study of the “Defects
Found Among Drafted Men.” That
book is official and authoritative. If
we take the averages of just blood,
and therefore inheritable, diseases
which the federal authorities found to
exist among our young men, and ap
ply them to the whole population the
results are almost beyond belief.
Such a summary would show for the
whole country—
Mental and nervous defects. 1,450,000
Veneral diseases 1,250,000
Tubercular persons 1,325,000
Blindness, in one or both
eyes 175,000
Alcoholics and drug addicts. 175,000
A grand total of 4,375,000
To these figures can be added the
safe estimate of Dr. Harry H. Laugh
lin, the noted eugenics expert, that
fully a million defectives, dependents
and criminals are now requiring cus
todial care in local, state and national
institutions.
Dr. Laughlin maintains, and has
proved, I think, that the custodial
groups of defective constitute only
five per cent of all those who are de
ficoent mentally. Translated into na
tional significance, his figures reveal
an appalling number of people in that
class. The heart sickens, and we al
most lose courage in the face of this
fact, for these deficiences are un
changeable and heredity will pass
them on to future generations.
In his book, “The Revolt Against
Civilization,” which fittingly has for
its subtitle, “The Menace of the Un
der Man,” Lothrop Stoddard reveals
the amazing results to posterity of
mentally deficient parentage. On
page 96, he says:
“A striking illustration of how su
periority and degeneracy are alike
rigidly determined by heredity is af
forded by the “Kallikak Family,” of
New Jersey. During the Revolu
tionary War, one Martin “Kallikak,”
a young soldier of good stock, had
an illicit affair with a feeble-minded
servant-girl, by whom he had a son.
Some years later, Martin married a
woman of good family by whom he
had several legitimate children. Now
this is what happened: Martin’s
legitimate children by the woman of
good stock all turned out well and
founded one of the most distinguished
families in New Jersey. In this fam
ily and its collateral branches we find
nothing but good representative citi
zenship. There are doctors, lawyers,
judges, educators, traders, landhold
ers, in short, respectable citizens, men
and women prominent in every phase
of social life. They have scattered
over the United States and are prom
inent in their communities whereve?
they have gone. . . . There have
been no feeble-minded among them;
no illegitimate children; no immoral
women, only one man was sexually
loose. In sharp contrast to this
branch of the family stand the de
scendants of the feeble-minded girl.
Of these 480 have been traced. Their
record is: 143 clearly feeble-minded,
36 illegitimate, 33 grossly immoral
(mostly prostitutes),' 24 confirmed
alcoholics, 3 epileptics, 82 died in in
fancy, 3 criminals, 8 kept houses of
ill fame. Here are two family lines,
with the same paternal ancestor, liv
ing on the same soil, in the same
atmosphere, and under the same gen
eral environment; yet the bar sinis
ter has marked every generation of
one and has been unknown in the
other.”
What does the official report, “De
