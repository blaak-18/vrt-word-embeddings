Sparks from the Fiery Cross
By JOHN EIGHT POINT
“The noblest motive is the public good” —Virgil
A successful Klansman is one who
has worked, not shirked; tried not
fried, shouldered responsiblity not
dodged it; put his shoulder against
the wheel not stood off and argued
About relativity while all his wife’s
relations got the wrong slant on
what one hundred per cent Ameri
cans were doing for their country.

The Anti-Know Nothing Plank
If we desire unrestricted immigra
tion with the doors of America open
to floods of aliens if we desire the
Japanese among us, owning our soil
and intermarrying with us —if we de
jire the wedding of church and state,
our government dictated by an alien
head, our theology polluted by for
eign interpretation, our religious
rights imperiled by an unyielding
and relentless foe, we may be favor
ably interested in the respicable ef
forts of a few who are seeking the
destruction of America by endeavor
ing to revive the principles of the
Anti-Know Nothing plank of 1856.
This plank, as we see it, was one
of the most vicious and ill-balanced
attempts ever made to strangle pure
Americanism by political trickery. A
modern repetition of the sentiment
and method ought to crush the party
making it because it is wholly alien
to our most constructive national
thought.
The vivid teatures of the 1856 dec
laration read as follows: “Every at
tempt to abridge the privileges of
becoming citizens and tne owners of
joil among us ought to be resisted
with the same spirit which swept the
alien and sedition laws from our
statute books * * * And whereas,
aince the foregoing declaration was
uniformly adopted by our predecos
aors in national convention an ad
verse political and religious test has
been secretly organized by a party
claiming to be exclusively American,
it is proper that American democracy
ahould clearly declare its determined
opposition to all secret political so
cieties, by whatever name they may
be called. And hence a political
crusade in the nineteenth century,
and in the United States of America,
against Catholics and foreign born
is neither justified by the past his
tory or the future prospects of the
country nor in unison with the spirit
of toleration and enlarged freedom
which peculiarly distinguished the
American system of popular govern
-111 point of fact the Underwood
recrudescence of the 1856 idea must
be understood in its true relations.
The Klan, as an organization is not
in politics- the stone from the old
eling flies wide —some Klansmen,
however, are in politics, and they are
willing to buy at any cost the con
tinued liberty of the American peo
pl'- . . .
There are heroes in our common life
Unknown to wealth and fame;
They go about their daily tasks,
Unmoved by praise or blame;
Their motive is the common good;
They have a noble creed;
They are the nation’s right hand
men—
Knights of the Worthy Deed.
* * *
We repeat again and again that
the Klan specifically stands for re
stricted immigration, separation of
church and state, and the mainten-
Anca of our public schools. That is
its public commitment—to stand for
these things without violence, with
out trickery, without self-abasement
or self-praise, sans pour et sans re
jirochc. And as we repeat this tru
ism we stress the fact that Klans
men should make it clear to the out
siders that these are the principles
*>f action and direction which we
most jealously guard All patriotic
American fraternalists stand or
should stand for the same things.
Citizens who do not uphold such
frinciples are not good Americans.
t takes a “heap o’ tellin’” to get
these simple, facts clear in the minds
of many otherwise intelligent peo
ple.

that Anne Louise Howard, who has
been grappling single-handed and
alone since December, 1922, with the
largest and most tragic relief prob
lem in all Europe’s dreary expanse
of hunger, hatred and suspicion, re
cently was attacked and injured on
one of the principal streets of her
field of operation by a political and
religious miscreant who might have
done serious harm had his aim been
better.” And this causes the Klans
man in ordinary to remark mildly:
"If the lady had been at home toiling
for America’s needy millions, leav
ing Europe’s problems to Europe her
self she might possibly have escaped
a bullet and encountered nothing
more savage than a brickbat." With
out abating our natural sympathy for
our European brothers who have suf
fered, would it not be more to the
practical point to spend a little of
that energy now given to Russia
upon our own hungry, destitute and
ignorant children of the mills and
mountains? What a noble gift to
the nation to turn into American cit
izens the human waste product of
our own broad land.

The Wheeling Intelligencer says:
"The difficulty in turning immi
grants into good Americans is to find
a model to work by.” Is that so?
Abraham Lincoln is a pretty fair
model.

If the loan of arms of Mexico
should eventually lead to the loan
of troops, the Klansman might come
to view the policy with wondering
eyes. What would it mean to station
American troops in small garrisons
here and there throughout the length
and breadth of Mexico? Would it
not lay America open to the charge
of imperialism? To extend the Platt
amendment from Cuba to Mexico
would be a serious responsibiliy and
an experiment the outcome of which
could not be guessed. As we see it,
this problem is not really an Ameri
can problem —and, as citizens, we
can only be interested in what vitally
concerns our national progress.
Maintaining order in Mexico at the
the expenditure of national energy
which might be better used in
strengthening American bulwarks of
statescraft and the enforcement of
federal laws afford the Klansman a
subject for debate.

.‘‘Race prejudice,” says the San
Diego Tribune, "is most acute in that
part of the higher race that is near
est the lower.” As usual the para
grapher is wrong. Race prejudice is
most acute in the imaginations of
those who perpetually accuse some
body of building race antagonism.
Three-fourths of the talk about race
prejudice is bunk and one-fourth is
premeditated malice on the part of
people who are hunting trouble.
Coinincidental with the rise of the
Klan has been the reduction of the
number of lynching® in the country,
in 1923, the year when the Klan be
gan a most victorious march in
membership, the number of lynch
ings was 57 per cent less than in
1922, thus proving conclusively that
the wiseacres who have connected
thoughts of violence with every act
of the Klan were basing their opin
ions upon the malicious utterances
of Klan enemies. In point of fact
the Klan, as a patriotic and social
betterment organization devoted to
broad ethical and educational ideals,
influenced the country vitally last
year toward cleaner and saner gov
ernment locally and nationally. In
this way it had its proud share in re
ducing serious acts of violence in
the year 1923.

TWILIGHT’S
THINKLINGS
Continued from page 1
“I can't understand how Dr. S
made such a mistake as Is revealed In
this case. I think that If Lula could
see better she would advunce faster

fective eyes have kept her back In
her work here. Lula has a. good
mind and should he doing better In
her studies. Mr. Johnson. When did
you say you had Lula's glasses fitted?”
"Don’t know exactly, but I think
It was three years ago.”
"Three years ago? Dr. S has
practiced In this town only seven
months.”
“Maybe It wasn’t Dr. S that
fitted them spectacles. Let me see;
who was It?”
“I'll call Lula, Mr. Johnson."
Presently Lula came Into the of
fice, registering surprise when she
saw her father.
“Lula,” asked the principal, “where
did you get those glasses you are
wearing?”
“Daddy subscribed for some kind
of a paper from a man, and he gave
him the glasses for nothing.”
DO YOU VOTE THAT WAY?
Some years ago the voters of
Minnesota had ten proposed
amendments to the state consti
tution on which to pass judg
ment. A long ballot needing
some previous study to be intel
ligently “marked” was given to
the voter as he stepped forward
to “do his duty.”
I had done my duty as a voter
and w'as walking up the street to
ward home when I met a friend.
Naturally our conversation drift
ed toward possible election re
sults. Presently my friend asked
me how I voted on “them fool
amendments.” I told him.
“I didn’t go to all that trouble,”
said my friend. “I voted for the
first amendment, and then took
every other one down.”
\ CHALLENGE AND A REMINDER
Behold the fiery cross as its
scintillating light penetrates the
darkness.
“Klansmen, what means this
beautiful symbol?” comes the
query from far and near.
The fiery cross is a dual sym
bol: emblematic of the Nazarene’s
glory, and the Light of the
World.
The fiery cross is in one—a re
minder and a challenge. The
burning cross reminds the Klans
man that to live unselfishly—
“not for self but for others” —is
a Christian’s duty, and challeng
es him to go forth as an active
follower of Jesus Christ, courag
eously fighting for that which is
clean and good and beautiful.
KLANSMEN, THE PROTESTANT
CHURCHES NEED YOU
In all the history of Protestantism
there has never appeared an influence
that has done so much for the Prot
estant churches as the Ku Klux Klan.
Wherever the Klan is strong, the
Protestant churches are stronger
than they ever were before, A true
Klansman realizes the necessity of
the Protestant churches and under
stands that he must do his part,
faithfully and well. A good Klans
man is either a member of or does
something definite toward the sup
port of a Protestant church.
Klansmen. you who are neglecting
your church, shake yourself out of
your indifference and go to the aid
of your church, financially and oth
erwise. Make every Sunday a “go-to
church” Sunday. Then there is work
within the church that needs lay*
men. volunteer your services as a
church-worker, don’t wait to be
coaxed. Klansmen, tho Protestant
churches need you.

CHICAGO, ILL., Keb. 25. —Klans
throghout Illinois are rendering real
service to the state, and to their
communities in many ways, accord
ing to reports reaching the Grand
Dragon’s headquarters in Chicago.
A membership campaign now be
ing conducted in certain sections is
proving remarkable successful. The
Klan’s settlement of the “Herrin
trouble,” and the active part played
by members of the organization ev
erywhere in enforcing the law, ex
posing vice, and curbing corruption
in public and semi-public office has
resulted in a reaction of the state’s
citizenship that expresses itself in
application for membership.
Members of the organization in
Chicago, astounded by the revela
tions of liquor selling, gambling and
"resort” running in this city, as re
vealed by the arrest of policemen
and other officials for participation
in “drinking and murder” parties,
are conducting a quiet investigation
that is expected to lead to many ar
rests in the near future.
Other Sect lons Active
Rockford, East St. Louis, Peoria,
and other cities throughout the state
are the centers of Klan efforts for
local cleanups. It is tecognized that
the persistetnt effort of the criminal
element gradually weakens the nom
inal resistance of many public offi
cials until criminality of all kind is
permitted to flourish more or less
openly. Klansmen seem to feel that
tneir unified opposition to crime will
not only strenghthen these officials
who are inclined to serve the public
well but will also be a great barrier
to a general demoralization.
Helping Each Other
Not content with an aggressive ex
hibition of their willingness to serve
their state and their local communi
ties Klansmen throughout Illinois,
according to reports reaching the
Grand Dragon’s office, are paying
more and more attention to the prac
tice of Klanishness.
OLD FORTRESS NEAR
ST. PAUL HISTORIC
Kuilding Has Seen Many Trans
formations in Over
100 Years
At the confluence of the Mississip
pi and Minnesota rivers, in a set
ting of natural beauty stands old
Fort Snelling, “pioneer guardian of
the northwest.” No historic celebra
tion, such as that being prepared for
St. Paul’s seventieth anniversary,
would be complete without due re
cognition to the part this old fort
played in the development of this
section. Although little more than
100 years old, it, nevertheless, has
witnessed some of the more extraor
dinary transformations that have oc
curred in any similar period in the
history of the United States.
Within the walls of the fortress,
now mellowed with age. is written a
colorful and romantic chapter of the
history of the frontier. On Sept. 10.
1820, the corner stone of what was
then called Fort Anthony was laid.
It was the extreme frontier of the
northwest, with nothing but wild
animals and savage tribes of Indians
within hundreds of miles in any di
rection. Later the name was chang
ed to Fort Snelling, in honor of the
colonel under whose command the
fort was built.
The round tower, still standing, is
a part of the original fortification.
It was built at the wast end of the
post as a guardhouse; but subse
quently loopholes were piered for
musketry.
Among the notable names connect
ed with the historical fort are those
of Lieut Zebulon Pike, the first man
to bring the United States flag to
Minnesota; Gen. Winifred Scott;
Henry R. Schoolcraft, the historian;
Constantine Beltrami, the Italian re
fugee; and Dred Scott—the slave
whose case had a direct bearing on
the Civil war-who based his claim
of immunity upon his residence at
the fort, which was on ground pro
hibited to slavery by the Missouri
Compromise of 1820.
Reminiscences of the old fort in
clude the coming of the Virginia and
her passengers in 1823, the first
steamboat to arrive at the point on
the upper Mississippi. School and
Sunday school was conducted in those
early days in the basement room of
the commanding officer’s quarters.
During the late war the old fort was
used as a training camp for officers.

Major Roy A. Haynes Makes
Addresses in Minnesota
Twin Cities
CONDITIONS IMPROVED
Klan Has Done Much to Make
Law Partial Success, Which
It Now Is
(By PASSERBY)
Recently Major Roy A. Haynes,
prohibition commissioner, visited the
Twin Cities. While in Minneapolis
he delivered addresses that were fill
ed with thunderbolt statements. He
said: "Every present and prospective
condition of American life demands
the eighteenth amendment and its
enforcing legislation. The old order
of things has passed away. Amid
the powerful inventions, science,
communication, travel, complexity
and hurried life of today, we all
know that sound bodies, steady
nerves and sober judgment are in
dispensable to life. These conditions
demand the prohibition of the use
of intoxicating liquors.
Business Improved
“It is my firm conviction that we
have a more sober, clear-minded and
consequently more efficient class of
big business men and better citizens
today than we had in pre-prohibition
days,” said Major Haynes.
At this point, however, he didn’t
mention the fact that “big business
men” get all the booze they want one
way or the other. As matters stand
with the present prohibition law en
forcement, to a man on the side
lines, it looks very much as if the
prohibition laws are for those who
either can’t afford to buy or don’t
want to take the chances that go
with the drinking of cheaper “stuff”
available.
“A sober citizenship stands out

tural in character and practical in
its usefulness. Five of the demon
inations have established a joint
school for Bible study, which is at
tended by more than 100 pupils.
From observations conducted dur
ing the short time the classes have
been in existence, they are found to
be popular with the children.
The commissioner of education.
L. R. S. Ferguson, has agreed that
whereas the children attend Bible
class during the regular school hours,
they will not be compelled to make
up the other school work they miss
as a consequence.
whole world,” Haynes further stat
ed.
"When the cities, the counties, the
states assume their proper share of
the law enforcement burden, to that
degree will the federal officers be
free to control the source of supply,
the border and the coast. The nrst
and most important thing you can do
is to impress home the responsibility
in the several communities. Give
enforcement officials information of
violations. If it is a small case,
don t go to the federal officials with
it. Take the matter up with your
local authorities.”
But when that doesn’t do any
good?
Anyway, as a Klanaman I’d like to
see the prohibition laws enforced ab
solutely and impartially. Wet offi
cers won t do it. That’s a certainty.
And when the commissioner of pro
hibition enforcement says that it
was not expected enforcement would
closely approximate 100 per cent suc
cess in “three, four ten or twelve
years after the adoption of the law,"
one wonders and wonders and won
ders.
If it wasn’t for the Ku Klux Klan
I doubt if present prohibition en
forcement would be 20 per cent.
