A TEXAS JEFF READER MAKING
CONVERTS.
Dear Sir: —As I am a subscriber
to The Jeffersonian, also the Maga
zine, I thought a few lines from this
neck of the woods would not be
amiss. I have not been reading your
Jeffersonians very long and have
just read one copy of your Magazine,
which I subscribed for in March.
My brother, J. C. McLeod, of Flor
ence, Texas, had The Jeffersonian
sent to me, and while I have always
admired you very much and have al
ways been a Democrat in politics, I
am frank to say I am with you from
now on. The principles you advo
cate are unanswerable. Your ar
ticles on Foreign Missions are good;
while I am a missionary Baptist I
agree with you when it comes to our
own people furnishing foreigners
free schools, free drug stores, and
everything else free, while thou
sands of our own people here at
home can not buy necessaries. I
think it is time to call a halt and I
w’ant you, Mr. Watson, to just keep
shelling the woods, it’s doing good.
I thought you acted wise in not de
bating the question with Ellis. You
could not afford to, but I do hope the
Peerless One will debate the issue
with you.
Your articles on Socialism are
fine; Socialism ought to be a stench
in every Southerner’s nostrils. Your
Jeffs are doing good on that line. I
handed a copy to a neighbor not long
ago who was a Socialist and it
knocked it all out of him; then he
came back after the Magazine.
I am waiting patiently for your
articles on Catholicism.
The political pot is beginning to
boil in Texas, four candidates for
the gubernatorial nomination, and
as Billy J. says, Prohibition is the
paramount issue.
Wishing you unbounded success,
I am Yours truly,
J. H. McLEOD.

GORDON LEE AND THE ALDRICH
TARIFF.
Dear Mr. Watson: —It is indeed
gratifying to see the good work go
ing on through your Jeffersonians.
The fruits of them shall never die,
and you, too, though you may not
be popular with all, will go down as
one of the greatest reformers the
world has ever seen.
If I am not asking too much of
you, please answer the following
questions:
(1) Explain the Aldrich-Payne bill
and tell why the rich man pays only
50 per cent, on automobiles and
every one pays 150 per cent, on
blankets.
(2) Did Gordon Lee vote for or
against it?
(3) Has he done anything in Con
gress that has helped common peo
ple, and if he has, please tell what
it is that he has done?
Hoping that I have not intruded
on your valuable time, and that your
life be prolonged so the good work
may continue, I am
Respectfully yours,
C. L. VEATCH.
Powder Springs, Georgia.
Answer.
(1) In the placing of Tariff duties
upon the thousands of articles which
are thus taxed at the Custom House,
the rates vary very much. For in
stance, on overcoats in which shoddy
is used, the rate is 250 per cent. On
plate glass, which only the rich can
buy, the duty ranges from 29 per
cent, to 100 per cent. On sugar,
which everybody has to buy, the rate
ranges all the way up to 120 per
eent. On woolen cloth, the tax is
7 cents per square yard, when the
value isn’t more than 15 cents per
square yard. If it is valued at the
Custom House at more than 15 cents
per square yard, the duty is 8 cents
per square yard; and in addition to
these rates there shall be added 50
per cent, advalorem, when the val
uation does not exceed 70 cents per
pound. On clothing, ready made,
and articles of wearing apparel of
every description, including shawls —
whether knitted or woven-*—and knit
ted articles of every description
made by or manufactured wholly, or
in part, of wool, the duty per pound
is four times the duty imposed on
one pound of unwashed wool of the
first-class, and in addition thereto,
55 per cent, advalorem. The duty
upon all wools and hair of the first
class, is 11 cents per pound; upon
wools or hair of the second-class, it
is 12 cents per pound. Now when
you add all these taxes together, you
will begin to understand that the
woolen schedule in the tariff, which
Mr. Taft says is the best this country
has ever had, is, undoubtedly, the
most infamous piece of legislative
rascality that ever was enacted, even
in the American Congress.
(2) No, Gordon Lee did not vote
for it, but voted against it. His
crime consists in the fact that he
voted, against the Democrats and in
surgents, and with the Cannon Re
publicans, to keep in the hands of
Cannon the power which enabled him
to pack the committees and thus con
trol the situation. Had Gordon Lee
remained true to the Democratic
leader, Hon. Champ Clark, of Mis
souri, and voted as the majority of
Democrats voted, Cannon would
have lost the power to pack the com
mittees and pass the diabolical Al
drich law. Cannon, himself, said, in
a speech delivered in Kansas City,
last November, that without the aid
of the twenty-three Democrats who
came to his rescue and upheld his
power, he could not have passed that
devilish law which puts a tax of 50
per cent, on the automobiles of the
rich and a tax of 165 per cent, on the
blankets of the poor. Gordon Lee
was one of those twenty-three Dem
crats whose desertion saved Cannon
land enabled him to pass ’ the law
which the Tariff robbers wanted.
(3) No, Gordon Lee hasn’t done
a blessed thing for the common peo
ple; and if you kept him there until
his head is as bald as a billiard cue,
he never would. He is a clever fel
low, personally, and I like him; but
he never was cut out for a Congress
man. He has been sufficiently tried
for the people of his district to be
aware of that fact. GIVE US NEW
BROOMS, and The Jeffersonian will
help you to make them SWEEP.
SO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE.
Dear Sir:—The knife to hand
O. K., and it is a dandy, too. I would
not take $1 for it, if I knew I could
not get another one like it. I can’t
see how you can give so much for so
little money. Please accept thanks
for it. Bidding you God-speed, I will
close. Respectfully,
p. t. mcbrayer.

SURPRISED AT OUTCOME OF MIS
SION CONTROVERSY.
Dear Mr. Watson: —When you be
gan your criticisms of the Foreign
Mission system of the present day, I
looked for what the country needed,
a lively, able, intelligent discussion,
backed up with facts and figures of a
convincing character. Having been
a believer in Foreign Missions, and
a contributor (in a modest way) for
more than half a century, I expected
to see you routed and put to shame,
for, like thousands of others, I had
given no thought to the management
or workings of the organizations
through which the work was being
done.
Your assertions, at first, confound
ed me; and I thought that you had
“missed the mark” this time, and
confidently expected to see you over
whelmed.
The subject and its importance led
me to believe that whatever discus
sion was had would be on a high
plane of Christian character.
In this, up to the present, I am
sadly disappointed.
I have, so far, seen neither facts,
figures, nor argument to controvert
your assertions. The editors of our
religious journals, who ought to be
posted, are either ignorant or guilty
of unchristian courtesies in treating
of the subject. As far as I have ob
served they attempt to discredit you
by personal taunts and “fool’s argu
ment” —ridicule. This mode of deal
ing with this great, world-wide sub
ject is not satisfactory to intelligent
people. Those engaged in the man
agement of this work owe to a too
confiding people to either meet and
disprove your allegations or confess
their truth.
You have withstood the taunts,
gibes, and jeers of merciless and vic
ious editors and others who do not
fight in the open. Until you are met
with logical, respectful, and fair ar
gument, you will continue to gain
friends. I have read and reread your
“write up” of the buzzard, and had
pronounced it as a success. But
when I read the editorial, “A Ma
ligner of Missions,” taken from that
great religious paper, “Western Rec
order,” of Louisville, Ky., a paper
that had been' a noble, consistent,
propagator of love and charity, I
thought, “how has the mighty fal
len.” A READER.
ANOTHER OF THE OLD GUARD.
Dear Sir: —I want space to say to
Bro. Arnold that I am one more who
has never bowed the knee to “Baal”.
I have never doubted the correctness
of our position. I have suffered
much for our cause and am willing
still to suffer if it needs be. Our
brave leader towers above any man
who has ever placed his foot on “ter
ra firma”. The faith I have in the
right overthrowing the wrong, that
“Truth crushed to earth will rise
again”, keeps me hopeful. I believe
that morn is breaking, and very
soon we shall see the light of a
brighter day.
Yours “Dyed in the Wool”,
Bethlehem, Ga. J. L. MOORE.

ANY INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN
MAY BECOME A LAWYER.
Dear Sir: —I am a young man,
have only a common school educa
tion and of limited means financially
and want to take up the study of
law as a profession. What would be
the proper course to pursue? What
books to study first, and on the av
erage how long will it take one to
sufficiently acquire enough knowl
edge to be admitted to the bar?
Please answer in The Jeffersonian.
Very truly yours,
W. S. STANLEY.
Lawrenceville, Georgia.
Answer.
In every case where an intelligent
young man has had a good common
school education, he is capable of be
coming a good lawyer, without fur
ther attendance upon schools. A col
lege education is not at <all neces
sary for such a case.
Let the young man go to the
nearest practicing attorney, and bor
row his Blackstone’s “Commenta
ries”. I have never known this re
quest to be turned down. It is in
variably the case, I think, that law
yers sympathize with young men who
desire to become members of the
profession. Consequently, there will
always be some member of the local
bar who will gladly lend his Black-
