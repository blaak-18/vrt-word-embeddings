r Mr. Lemon, an agent of the N. O.
Paeleo R R. was in our town several
days this week attending to the re
Seotding of let mortgage on the maid
road. e left here on Friday for
Opelomas on a similar mlssion. He
says the id road will be completed
'to Alexandria from Texas in ten
months. The Bed Rlver trade will
be lreased thereby, at least until
the Bouthen rtn p from Alessn
drin to New Orleans s completed.
Mr. Lemon says that the N. O. Pa.
dele will never unite with Morgan
l Road, and that any report to
Ssad effect is without foundation.
a There is a conflct of interest between
the two roads which would prevent
any suchb consummatlion. The more

Col. McCranie, of the Ouachita
Telegraph, comes out in a long and
well-written article, defining the ju.
dical square under the prioting law
of 1877. The article was written in
reply to a query propounded to the
Colonel by one of our learned Dis
trict Judges. We regret having only
space for the following etract :
In gettfing at the space a hundred
words Ia the type used should be
counted, and the space measured
and after this is done with several
different paragraphs, the average
will give the space In inches and
hfactioos sufelently aoourate not to
vary the ebharge tea ents In twelve
months. Butte sbould be recollee'
ed that the verbiage In legal adver.
tisements is principally monosylla
ble, and thus averages lower than
common reading matter. Take out
the words, improvements, appraise
meat, contalning, consistlng and a
few others and a sheriff's sale le
nearly all in hard, terse Anglo-Saxon.
It is also to be remembered that
every abbreviation, each initial, and
nearly every figure counts as a word
in making the estimate for "the
space of one hundred words, or frac.
tion thereof." The fractions of
squares, we may add, are seldom
charged for, unless they equal half.
a-square, or several added together
make that much, or more.
