Members of F. U. Paying for
Blunders of Officials
To the Members of the F. E. and C.
U. of Texas:
If, by expressing ’a Jew thoughts
relative to the situation affecting the
future of usefulness of this splendid
organization, I may not be classed as
a “hanger-on”, or some other sort of
an “undesirable citizen”, I will take
this method of answering the numer
ous letters that come to hand from
friends, who seem to feel somewhat
discouraged as a result of our or
ganization being compelled to devote
so much valuable time and money in
an effort to overcome the blunders
and mistakes of those to whom we
had entrusted the grave responsibili
ty of steering our boat through the
rugged waters so" oft beset with
breakers. I do not think the loyal
membership of this great and indis
pensible institution of ours can af
ford to become so uncharitable as to
lose sight of the fact that man, at
best, is nothing more than a small
mound of clay, composed of mistakes
and failures, hence the necessity of
the multiplied wisdom of the entire
membership to decide by their bal
lots, through the referendum to be
taken in the locals to determine
whether we secede from the National
Union, and thereby break a sacred
compact made with the membership
of the other States, and to that ex
tent place ourselves before the world
as repudiations. Were I writing a
ritual for this institution, the answer
to this would be No, a thousand times
NO. Texas canSnever afford to stul
tify her manhood by deserting her
brethren of the other States, who
have, with the aid and approval of
Texas, declared war, and the unequal
battle is now on to determine wheth
er the women and little children of
the South are to go back to the cot
ton-fields, and there be eternally re
garded as chatties, necessary only to
the making of profits for others to
enjoy.
This is the great issue, as I see it,
involved in the vote to be taken in
the locals of Texas: If the member
ship of Texas will, by their votes,
send the message down the line to
the other States that we are with
you, this question will be settled, as
it was designed to be by the founders
of our order, but if, by our votes, we
shrink back from the grave respon
sibilities that confront us, and there
by confess to the world that the or
ganized farmers of Texas are only
capacitated to blindly follow the
blind until they fall in the ditch,
then this issue can never come before
the public opinion for its solution
within the next twenty years. We
should, with charity, consider the
mistakes made by each other, even
those of our officials, for they are
no less liable to mistakes than the
membership. Any other view com
mits us to that old barbaric idea;
that the King can do no wrong,
therefore I have an abiding faith in
the intelligence of the members to
vote for a continuance of the co
operative efforts with the National
Union, and that Texas will always be
found in the front, battling for the
emancipation of the white slaves of
the South.
51)4 "Ucffcrsonlan
I was impressed with the idea,
while attending the recent confer
ence, at Fort Worth, of how much
more appropriate it would have been
to have spent the four or five thou
sand dollars, that the conference cost
the farmers of Texas, to correct a
mistake made by its official heads, to
have used it for the erection of a
marble shaft, marking the birthplace
in Raines County, and the birthplace
in Lampasses County, of the two
greatest farmers’ organizations that
have blessed civilization, then
when any of us became too much im
pressed with the importance of our
own ideas that run counter to the
cardinal principles of the two insti
tutions, we could give them a vaca
tion, and let them visit one of those
monuments, and absorb the true
spirit that underlies this contest.
The first circular sent out to the lo
cals to surrender by seceding, and
thereby escaping the share of the re
sults of a mighty battle, reminds us
of an incident that occurred to a lot
of gentlemen, who were in the habit
of taking an annual hunt in the
canebreaks of Southern Texas, near
the mouth of the Colorado River,
where game, both large and small,
lay hidden in the vicinity thereof.
There was a negro boy in that neigh
borhood, who had a pack of trained
dogs, that had built quite a reputa
tion with the hunters who visited
these jungles, which gave this boy
considerable revenue as well as no
toriety as the leader in the chase.
On one occasion he and his dogs
were secured, and when the trail
was being hotly pursued, by
dogs, and hunters, the excitement
of the chase was abruptly brought
to a close by the dogs return
ing showing signs of having an
encounter with some ferocious
beast, for they w r ere bleeding and
torn; no amount of force or persua
sion on the part of the colored boy
could induce them to again take up
the chase, instead they supinely
crouched in the rear. Finally the
boy, after showing on his coun
tenance mortification and chagrin,
said, “Boss, I tells you deres some
kind of varment in dis bresh dat
dese here dogs of'mine has never
ben bred up to scrap, but if you
genlmen wants me to, Ise willin to
blow my horne for um over on de
prary where you can see em run
some rabbits, dey is swif runners
shore.”
Now, boys, let us not get confused
when we come to vote on the ques
tion that affects the existence of this
organization, and follow off in a
rabbit chase, but stay in the jun
gles, dogs or no dogs, by voting for
the National Union.

To Investigate the Charges
Against F. U. Officials
Dear Mr. Watson:—We send you
some resolutions for publication
adopted at a regular meeting of Lo
cust Grove Local No. 1363, February
12, 1910:
Whereas there are grave public
charges standing against some of our
State officials (that have never been
answered), namely, J. L. Lee,
Duckworth, Bodenhamer and Lad
son, and said charges are proving
very detrimental to the progress of
our order, and we feel that our or
ganization should not carry the em
barrassment longer; therefore be it
Resolved, That our National
President, Charles S. Barrett, have
the matter investigated at once by
an impartial and fair-minded com
mittee of five members of the order,
that said committee meet in Atlanta
or Macon and that said investigation
be public, and if after investigation
said charges are not refuted then we
demand their immediate resignation
and that their places be filled with
capable, conscientious men who have
the good of the order at heart.
Second, “That we will stand for
the right and good of our noble in
stitution.”
Third, That we petition our Con
gressmen to use their best efforts to
pass such laws as look to the sup
pression of all gambling in futures
on farm products—as now practiced
in New York and New Orleans Cot
ton Exchanges, and all other insti
tutions operated in like manner.
Fourth, That we are unalterably
opposed to the Central Banking
scheme—also the destruction of the
$364,000,000 of Greenbacks now in
circulation, as advocated by the
money sharks of the East.
Fifth, That in lieu of the estab
lishing of a Central Bank we favor
Postal Savings Banks.
Sixth, We favor the Government
issuing enough paper currency based
on the credit of the Government to
do the legitimate business of the
•people.
Seventh, That we favor the par
cels-post as advocated for the rural
people.
Eight, That we stand unalterably
opposed to the Ship Subsidy bill now
pending in Congress.
Ninth, That we do most earnest
ly ask our Representatives in Con
gress to do all in their power to
P resent Tari ff bill repealed,
whi lS C ? Using such high prices
in both bread and meat and in fact
everything that is consumed by the
common people.
Tenth, That we oppose and will
not recognize as our official organ a
publication whose stocks and policy
Rnt controlled by private parties.
But favor our organization owning
its own publication, and that the
policy, of the same be under the su
pervision and control of a committee
created by the proper authorities.
Eleventh, That a copy of the
above resolutions be sent to The Jef
fersonian and Union News, with re
quest to publish same.
