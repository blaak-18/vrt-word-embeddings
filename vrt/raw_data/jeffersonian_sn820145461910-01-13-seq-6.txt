O LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE O
HERE IS OUTLER AGAIN.
My Dear Sir: —A copy of your pa
per has just been handed me,' in
which you criticise the position taken
by me in that you differ from me
on prosperity, high tariff, and the
Republican Administration. Permit
me to say, if you will, that never
for one moment have I doubted the
sincerity of your purpose; I believe
you are as honest as the days are
long; there is, however, a large ele
ment of people who do not believe
about you as I do. I have always
held that you were the personifica
tion of honesty; you have in the
past, and doubtless will in the fu
ture, however, make a lot of mis
takes. One of the mistakes it seems
to me that you have made is to not
publish my open letter in your paper.
You have made this mistake, I think,
inadvertently; however, the readers
of your paper know nothing of what
I said in the Courier-Dispatch.
You say your columns are open
for any criticism of yourself; had 1
known this I would have sent to you
direct the open letter written by me,
and I ask you now to publish my
open letter to you in your paper, and
then follow same up with any sug
gestions that you see fit to make.
You have unthoughtedly done identi
cally the same thing to me that you
accuse Dr. Lovett of doing to you.
The Doctor was undoubtedly wrong,
as you state, and you, too, are un
doubtedly wrong in answering an
open lettei' written by me without
printing that letter. I am as abso
lutely certain as I am that I have life
that the Republican party and high
tariff are responsible for this unpre
cedented prosperity.
In conclusion, let me ask that you
publish my open letter in connection
with your criticism, and I will be sat
isfied. I am sufficiently egotistic to
believe that I can take care of my
self in an argument of this kind and
all I care for is fair play, treating me
squarely, which I will certainly do
to you.
Yours very truly,
J. M. OUTLER.
Dublin, Ga., Dec. 28, 1909.
Answer.
My Dear Sir:—Your favor receiv
ed. You sent your open letter ad
dressed to me to the Dublin Courier-
Dispatch for publication, and as you
did not even notify me that you were
doing so, had it not been that one of
my friends in Laurens county cut the
letter out and mailed it to me, I
would never have known anything
about it. I had not seen that num
ber of the Courier-Dispatch.
The rule on the subject of open
letters is perfectly well-known to our
profession. The writer of it chooses
his own method of communicating it
to the public. Whatever paper he
chooses is the recognized organ of
communication between the writer of
the letter and the man to whom it is
written. In other words, the writer
of such a letter sends it to the per
son to whom it is written, through
the channel of a periodical chosen by
himself, instead of using the cus
tomary method of transmitting
through the mails. There is no rule
of journalistic ethics which allows
you to first send a letter to another
paper, and then demand that I pub
lish it in mine. I had as much right
to choose the paper through which I
would answer your letter as you had
to choose that through which you
would send it. If I had misrepre
sented your position in any way, you
would have the right to complain.
You were not misrepresented, but,
on the contrary, every position taken
by you was fully stated so that our
readers could know what points you
made. To publish your letter now
would necessitate the republication
of mine, and this I can not at present
do: we are too crowded. If you
choose to write a rejoinder to my
last editorial, and will mail it to me
with a request for its publication in
The Jeffersonian, it will be publish
ed, but I can not put into my paper
long articles which have appeared in
other papers.
There is no similarity between my
attitude and that of Dr. Lovett. No
body has been allowed to attack you
in The Jeffersonian as Dr. Lovett al
lowed Towson and Cleckler to attack
me in the Wesleyan Christian Advo
cate. No one has published you as
a liar, and produced evidence in The
Jeffersonian pretending to convict
you of the falsehoods which it was
claimed you told. Had I allowed
this, as Dr. Lovett did against me in
the case of Cleckler and Towson, I
would have been ashamed of my
self if I had not allowed you the
privilege of defence in our columns.
Dr. Lovett violated all the rules of
fair debate by allowing Mr. Towson,
in his conclusion on me, to introduce
new matter, to which I have been
denied the privilege of rejoinder.
In your case, not only has no rule
of journalistic ethics, or of fair de
bate, been violated, but I have strict
ly conformed to the highest stand
ards.
If you want to be heard in The
Jeffersonian, you must send your
communications directly to me, as I
sent mine directly to Dr. Lovett.
When you do this, you will see that
I will not refuse you a fair fight, as
Dr. Lovett did me.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.

AS TO THE “GIRLIE” CREATURE.
Dear Sir: —Please answer the fol
lowing questions in The Jefferson
ian :
(1) Is it true that you were chal
lenged by H. L. Gurley to argue the
matter (Socialism) and in a letter
replied: “I do not care to go into a
discussion of what Socialism really
is”?
(2) What kind of a party is this
new political party that is being or
ganized to be known as the “Frater
nal Party”? Its declaration of prin
ciples seems to be along the same
lines as those of the old-time Green
back party, with some additions.
Yours truly, POPULIST.
Answer.
(1) I have already explained that
the wording of the letter to Gurley
was due to a mistake of my Secre
tary. She was instructed to write
the tiresome and persistent man that
I did not care to discuss Socialism
with him.
One of my reasons was, that it was
clearly evident that he did not un
derstand the subject. To discuss it
with Gurley, would be a waste of
time. ,
Another reason was, that I was
quite occupied by the studies I was
making preparatory to writing the
series of chapters on Socialism,
Zslje Jeffersonian
which have appeared in the Maga
zine.
Mr. Brand, Mr. Raoul and others
have been given a very liberal share
of space in The Jeffersonian, for the
purpose of airing their Socialist
views. Mr. Brand wrote much more
forcibly than Gurley does.
(2) Ido not know.
THE CATHOLIC FRIARS.
Dear Sir:—Please send the week
ly Jeffersonian, for three months, to
John F. Walsh, Station T, Los An
geles, Cal.; inclosed find 25 cents
stamps.
Mr. Watson, I wish you would en
lighten me in regard to the article
in your Weekly, wherein you state
it is the practice of the priests to
spend the first night with the bride.
I have been told that no priest is
allowed to cohabit with any woman 1 ;
and must live a pure and noble life
like Christ; why, then, is the Cath
olic church so lax against the priests
in the Philippines?
Yours very truly,
S. A. SWANSON.
Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 19, 1909.
Answer.
Men do not cease to have the pas
sions of men when they become
priests. Most of the Popes had bas
tard children. Pius IX. left two
daughters, who are the beauties of
Rome. Cardinal Antonelli, who was
the power behind the throne for so
long a time, left a daughter, who
put in her claim to his estate. The
man who can believe that a thick
lipped, bull-necked, fat-jowled Irish
man can go through life without
touching a woman, can believe any
old thing, whatsoever. Some of the
Irish bishops in this country have
faces that are as sensual as any you
can find.
As to Frenchmen, Italians, Span
iards and Portuguese abstaining
from women, whom the Church puts
in their power, the thing is simply
incredible. If those Latin monks,
friars and priests were all spayed,
the nuns could escape from the “re
treat parlor” without serious injury;
but nobody who is familiar with the
most prominent and universal trait
of the Latin character could possi-
NOTICE
To All Subscribers, Agents, Newsdealers and Friends:
With the issue of the February number (about January 24th),
WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE will appear in a new cover,
and will be much larger. It will hereafter be known as WATSON’S
MAGAZINE, or more familiarly, as “WATSON’S”. The price win re
main the same, ten cents per copy, one dollar per year; no more and no
less.
The features of Mr. Watson’s writing for the Magazine during 1910
will be “Roman Catholicism”, “The Story of the South and West” (his
torical and biographical), “Napoleon Up To Date”, and the most dra
matic part of “Andrew Jackson”, when he fought the proposed Central
Bank, and smashed it; and waged, relentless war upon the robber Tariff.
THE JEFFERSONIAN will be larger and better this year than ever
before. Our subscription list is growing at an unparalleled rate, and
we are giving our subscribers the benefit of our larger revenue. We
would like to have the paper known everywhere as “THE JEFF”.
We ask our friends to go out as missionaries among the heathen
at home, and bring in all the mentally halt, maimed and blind, who
don’t read “THE JEFF” or “WATSON’S”, and set them down to a sam
ple copy. We want 1910 to be the banner year of our two “Dive Wires”.

PROUD TO BE CALLED “BROTH
ER” BY THIS MAN.
Dear Brother:—l will call you
brother, because I believe we are of
the same regenerated family. I sent
you this morning eighteen subscrib
ers to your Jeffersonians and post
office order for same. I did not get
them for the money there is in it, but
I am very much interested in the
principles you advocate.
I have no education, have had to
dig out of mother earth what little
I have accumulated, so you know
how it came, and that the amount
is small, but I believe you know
whereof I am not cursed with the
care of a fortune.
I see some of your friends are ad
vising you not to expose certain
principles, for fear of your life. I
can only say that truth crushed to
earth will rise again, and I believe
you are a chosen vessel endowed
with a higher power to lead the
children of God out from under a
sin-cursed Government. We find in
olden times, when God’s children
were in bondage, that God endowed
the right man at the right time to
lead them out. Sometimes it took
the sacrifice of property and of life,
and I see but little use of history
except that under like circumstances
like powers may fall to our lot. So
I firmly believe that a revela
tion such as has never been known
in the United States is but a short
distance in the future.
I never attempted to write for
publication but once, and then I gave
the editors a jolt for not publishing
but one side of questions. There
fore, it found its way to the waste
basket, as I expected. You are the
only editor I believe I ever have read
after that would give both sides an
honest, legitimate consideration, —
religious papers are not excepted.
Yours as long as you stand upon
your present principles, and if I out
live you, would be too glad to cast
some flower of honor upon your
grave.
T. E. HIGHSMITH,
Gainesville, Ga., R. F. D. 6.
AND BY THIS ONE, AS WELL.
Dear Brother:—l address you as
brother because it comes nearer ex
