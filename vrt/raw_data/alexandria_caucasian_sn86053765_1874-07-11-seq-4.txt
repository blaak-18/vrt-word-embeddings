Br. J. Walker's California
Yinegar Bitters are a pdrely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of whleh are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
*' What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of Yixkgar Bit
XEBst" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator. and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vur
kqae Bitters iu healing the sick of
every disease man ft heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of D r. W amc
B r's vikeqar bittbbs are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.
