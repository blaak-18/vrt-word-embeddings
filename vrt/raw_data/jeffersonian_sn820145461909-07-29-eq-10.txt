Your two telegrams of yesterday
delivered to me this morning. The
power to protect person and property
and to preserve order in the State be
longs to the State government, and
the duty to furnish such protection
and to thus preserve order devolves
upon the State government. In my
judgment the United States Govern
ment does not have this duty devolv
ed upon it unless called on, either by
the State Legislature or by Jhe Gov
ernor when the Legislature is not in
session, to protect the State against
domestic violence as prescribed in the
Constitution of the United States. For
this reason I do not deem it proper
to ask the intervention of the United
States Government. It is to be hoped
that the trouble may be permanently
removed by relieving the white fire
men from negro competition.

Mr. E. A. Ball, Vice-President B. of
L. E. .Atlanta, Ga.
Your telegram of yesterday re
ceived this morning. I have had
long personal interview today with
President Taft. I am in entire sym
pathy with contention that negro
firemen should not be put in compe
tition with white firemen. In my
judgment locomotive engines on
Southern railroads should be manned
exclusively by white men, just as lo
comotive engines are manned exclu
sively by white men on Northern
railroads. Nevertheless, having in
mind the conference with the Presi
dent, I must strongly and earnestly
urge that there be no interference
by any one with the running of mail
cars, and thus avoid giving any pos
sible excuse for Federal interven
tion. It is not probable that the
Federal Government will indicate to
railroad management that negro fire
men should not be employed on mail
engines. But if there is no inter
ference by any one with running of
mail cars, there will be nt> excuse for
Federal intervention, and the situa-
The Jeffersonian
tion will properly be left to be dealt
with by our own people, and I
am confident that they will in the
end satisfactorily adjust the existing
difficulties. I must strongly urge
scrupulous compliance by every one
with the course suggested above.

The new novel by Zach McGhee,
which begins in the August number
of Watson’s Magazine, is a story of
the South as it is today, written by a
Southerner. It sparkles with humor,
is full of quaint characters, and its
plot is exciting.
SOME CHEAP BUT SERVICEABLE
POULTRY HOUSES.
Messrs Editors: —Ninteen years
ago when we were married we com
menced to raise poultry for sale. As
I had several years of experience as
a farm hand, I had learned that hens
do not care how a house looks. Just
so it is comfortable, they will lay
eggs and sit at any time. We rented
land and had no money to start with,
so could not build costly houses.
Straw and corn fodder were plentiful,
so we set posts in the ground and
framed, then roofed with straw and
sided with fodder. We fed plenty of
oats and corn, kept the fowls free
from lice, and they made us money.
Three years ago we came South,
bought land and were still too poor
to build nice poultry houses. Now
we set posts and frame to them, and
roof with anything that will turn
water. Split out pine slats and side
close enough to keep out the o’pos
sums and skunks, tack on sacks to
break the wind in winter, keep the
sheds clean, feed the flock well and
keep them free from lice and give
plenty of clean water, and they make
us money.
Not much secret about that. Any
one can do it. —Progressive Farmer.
