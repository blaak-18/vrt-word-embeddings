THE MONEY QUESTION
VIEWS OF SENATOR J. P. JONES
OF NEVADA.
It Deelares the Value of the Dollar Do
ponds on the Number In Clroalatlon.
The Material In the Dollar ias Noth
lag to Do With It.
Political economy has been called
*the dismal science." The most dis
mal branch of it, if men are to en
deavor to force conclusions to fit some
preconceived theory without refer
once to principle, is that which re
lates to money. The persistent de
termination to make the whole
science subordinate to the abeurdities
of the gold standard has operated like
a Westinghouse brake on the pro
gress of the civilized world.
But there is one system of monetary
science that if held stedfastly in view
will constitute an unerring guide
through that which would otherwise
be a path of inextricable difficulty.
That principle is that the value of
the unit of money in any country is
determined by the number of units in
circulation. In other words, the val
ue of every dollar depends on the
number of dollars out.
The greater the number of dollars
out, other things being equal, the less
will be the value of each dollar; the
fewer the number out, other things
remaining the same,athe greater the
value of each, and this without any
regard whatever to the material of
which the dollars are composed. This
is the key to the financial situation in
the United States. Much more is the
key to the tinancial situation in every
land. Without this key it is in vain
that the student attempts to un
lock the door leading to the
arcanum of monetary knowl
,edge. Unlike many of the
locks made by man, the locks on this
door are unpickable. The house
hold of science is one that thieves
cannot break through and steal He
who would enter must first find the
key. With this key in hand, the
most secret recesses may be explored
with confidence. Without it the
student travels in a circle, returning
after muchlabor to the point from
which he started upon his journey.
Like one in a maze, when most con
fidently expecting to find his way out
he sees himself coming up against
impassable barriers
If money were unlimited in quanti
ty it would have no value whatever.
Nothing has value that is unlimited
in quantity. If instead of sand the
ocean beach were strewn with gold
dust, it would have no value whatever
as a commodity. Yet if that gold dust
were taken up and coined into pieces
of money, the number of such pieces
being limited, they would have value
precisely as gold pieces have value
to-day. And, on the other hand, as
Adam Smith says, "If gold should
reach a certain degree of scarcity the
slightest bit of it might become as
valuable as a diamond."
So absolutely clear are leading
writers that the value of the money
unit in every case, other things being
equal, is determined by the number of
units out, and does not depend upon
the material of which the money may
be composed, that they have not the
slightest hesitation in asserting that

it is not, in the true and full sense,
money at all; if a full legal ten
der, it needs nothing behind it but
the law which makes it a legal ten
der for all debts and demands, and a
regulation of its quantity, to maintain
the monetary unit at any desired
level of value.
It is not to the credit, but the
power, of the government that is be
hind it in the law of legal tender and
in the right to increase or diminish
the issues. Taxes are payable in
money, and debts are payable in
money, and the only way people can
get money is by competing with one
another for it in all the occupations
of life. It is this universal competi
tion to get it that fixes the value of
all kinds of money, as it is competi
tion that fixes the value of other
things. In the work of competition
the number of dollars to be competed
for, other things being unchanged,.
must determine the value of each
dollar.
We are informed by so-called .fin
anciers" and statisticians, and by an
army of ready-made political econo
mists among the gold standard press
-gentlemen who have not taken the
trouble to carefully study the subject
-that the value of gold is unchang
ing, and that to attempt to depart
from what is called the "-gold stand
ard" would be to set at naught all
the principles of justice and even to
defy the very laws of nature. This
is an argument used only since the
demonetization of silver. Up to that
time it was well recognized by
all who gave any attention to the sub
ject of money, and is still well recog
nized by all the authorities on politi
cal economy, that both silver and
gold are variable in value. So seri
ous indeed from time to time have
been the variations in the value of
money that thoughtful men-some of
them distinguished economists-have
long observed and commented on the
gross injustice which such variations
involves, and various suggestions
have been made of methods for secu
ring stability of value in the monetary
unit.
Up to the period when the creditors
discovered the ingenious plan of sur
reptitiously increasing by an appeal
to the legislative arm of all govern
ments the value of all debts due, and
to become due to them, by depriving
debtors of the immediate right to pay
in either of the two metals, it was
acknowledged by the most eminent
economists that the adoption of a sin
gle metal as a so-called -standard"
of money, did not secure a great de
gree of uniformity in value as the
adoption of both metals. This may
seem a paradox to those who have
not reflected on the essential nature
of money, and upon the method by
which it obtains what is termed its
"-value," which it does through the
medium of the prices of commodities.
They ask: How can therd be a stand
ard composed of two things? Must
not a standard be one? Can it be
two or more?
The seeming paradox involved in
the idea that what is called a ,stand
ard of value" may be composed of
more than one material is made very
plain when the fact is borne in mind
that it is not the material but the
quantity of money that constitutes
the standard. The quality to which.
in the case of value, the word "stand
ard" is applied, is not a quality in
berent in the material of money.
Value, as I have shown, does not re
side in any article, nor in the sub
stance of any article. When the con
sideration to be kept in view is not an
object, but a service-not a
material, but a function-the
mnstrument by which that service
or function is performed seed not
-ecessarilly be limited to one mate
rial. Inasmuch as the purpose to be
served is the attainment of a correct
result, whatever the material by
whioh it may be saoomplished, such
number of materials may be indispeo
sible to that end should without hes
itasioa bee mployed If we wish to
obtai a elook which will indicate the
correct time, we do not Imist that it
shall be made of any one material
The material of whleh money is made
is no mere a staedard of value than
the material of a ooek I the stand

Hence a gold standard means the

mu.t be clear from the consideration
that if from a country which possess

only to buy commodities, which clar

commodities forming the subject of

could not have exported the commodi

OUR GRAND COUNTRY.
REPUBLIC IN NAME. IN FACT A
MONARCHY.
A Moneyed Aristocrary, Supported by
the Federal Courts and Regular Army,
Have Forced the J'eoptert Tamely Sub
mit to Untold Usurpations.
During the past thirty years a
moneyed aristocracy has been grad
ually gaining a footing in this oun
try until for some years it has dic
tated acts of legislation and decisions
of courts at will, and to that extent
that over three-fifths of the nation's
wealth has been wrung from the peo
ple and placed in the hands of the
few. A once free republic has been
changed into a monarchy in fact, if
not in name.
If any doubt the power of this mon
eyed combine over our legislation and
the courts let them note a few, even.
of the imnportant acts of legislation
and court uecikions for the past thirty
years:
First, placing two exceptions on
the greenbacks in 1862 which was the
sole cause of their dcpreciatica below
par; the establisment of national
banks in 1864, whereby the govern
ment loaned banking money at 1 per
cent, which they have loaned at from
7 to 5U per cent ever since: the cor.
traction act of 1866 under which over
70 millions of non-interest bearing
greenbacks were drawn from circula
tion by issuing interest bearing bonds
in their stead; the credit strengthen
ing act of -1s69, under which the
bonds that had been bought
with greenbacks at 40) cants on the
dollar and which were made payable
in lawful money which included
greenbacks, were made payable in
coin. The difference between the
value of this coin and greenbacks at
the time put over 6U0) million dollars
in the hands of the bond holders: the
refunding act of 1870. which changed
the whole bond indebtedness into long
time bonds in order to perpetuate the
national debt upon future generations;
the act to demonetize silver in 1873
and sot up a single gold standard in
its stead has depreciated the value of
silver bullion one-half and all pro
ducts of labor and all property
the same, while all debts have been
doubled; after the people in 1878 had
forced congress to provide for the
coinage of from two to four million
silver dollars per month, the Sher
man act of 1890 stopped silver coin
age and instead bought 4,50,000
ounces of silver per month and issued
silver certificates against the same.
but the money power soon wanted
something better and forced an extra
session of congress in 1893 to annul
this act, thereby destroying the last
vestige of silver; last fall the bankers
met in Baltimore and set up a plan to
destroy all the greenbacks and to
issue all the paper money themselves.
In obedience to their command. 'leve
land urged the scheme in his message
and but for a few Poullest votes it
would have become a law; again, last
January, they had the president issue
a special message, urging congress to
issue five hundred million dollars'
worth of bonds to be payable in gold.
This would have become a law, but
for the same Populist votes; a little
later, they introduced a bill to in
definitely postpone the payment of
the Union Pacific railroad debt to the
government. This was defeated by
the same votes; they havo purposely
robbed the treasury of its gold and
compelled the president to issue one
hundred and sixty-five million dollars'
worth of interest-bearing bonds, in a
time of profound peace, to run the ex
penses of the government.
So much for class legislation to
benefit the few.
Before the war, the supreme court
in the ,"Dred Scott" decision, said a
negro had no rights a white man was
bound to respect it took four years
of war to strarighten out that kink.
Now, in the ,.income tax" decision,
they have repeated that the people
have no rights that Wall street is
bouna to respect except to do all the
work and pay all the taxes. In the
Dl)ebe case, the supreme court's de
cisioa says ino substance that should
all the railroad, manufacturing and
other combines unite to reduce wages
to ten cents a day and any number of
men should attempt to prevent such
reduction, any federal court could
issue an injunction to prevent them
and imprison them if they should dis
obey. This decision clothes monopolj
with unlimited power to gratify any
extreme of selfishness.
The above briefly outlined acts and
decisions, granted to a moneyed aris
tooracy, are but a few of many others
of the same nature. Who can deny
that we have graduall become a
monarehy in fact, though not in
name? Now, when we consider how
tamely the people have submitted to
all this, would it create much of a

the president, nearw the close of his
term of oes, to declare himself per

members belong to the money power
and every man who has been so far

We Agree
The ;ainesville Hesperian declares
that "the problem of taxation is fully
as important as the currency ques
tion; and it will not be long until it
will be the leading issue in state
affairs. We are taxed too much for
what we get. We mean state, county
and city taxation. We could do on
less. Too many men are living at
the public expense and demanding
that they be furnished with employ
ment at the cost of the taxpayers.
Our courts are too costly and are
growing more so. * * * Here is
where our greatest waste of money
is. We have too many courts, and
this number has to a great extent
been necessary by the useless waste
of time. Let it be remedied. There
is wisdom enough in Texas to reform
this evil."
We agree. But how are you to
secure these reforms? Certainly not
throungh the Democratic party, for
every legislature makes matters
worse, increases the deficiency.
There is absolutely no hope for re
form in the Democratic party. It is
controlled by lawyers, and they want
more courts, more crime, more cor
ruption, for in and by such condi
tions they thrive. Of course there
are many lawyers who are honorable
exceptions to the above.

CALAMITY HOWLERS.
ARE BECOMING MORE NUMER
OUS EVERY DAY.
Even tie Sup'eme Court of the United
State.s usr a Quartette of Thom
Income Tax Decision a Grose
Iniquity.
If Populists had given utterance to
the expressions that fell from the lips
of the four dissenting justices of the
supreme court in the income tax case,
they would have been hooted at from
Dan to Beerseaba as "calamity howl
ers." Listen 'a them. Justice Harlan
says: "The practical, if not direct ef
fect, of the decision today is to give
certain kinds of property a position of
favoritism and advantage that is in
consistent with the fundamental prin
ciples of our social organization, andi
to invest them with power and influ
ence that is perilous to that portion of
the people upon whom reats the larger
part of the burdens of government, and
who ought not to be subjected to the
domination of aggregated wealth any
more than the property of the Country
should be at the mercy of the lawless."
Justice Jackson is reported as follows:
The decision, in his opinion, practically
destroyed the power of the govern
ment to reach incomes. It takes from
congress its rightful power to fix the
rate of taxation ,and substitutes there
fore a rule incapable of application
without imposing the most monstrous
inequality on the citizens of the com
mon country. The decision reversee
the common rule of taxation by exempt
ing those who were best able to pay
and forcing the burden upon the shoul
ders of the least able to pay. In coa
clu-ton, Justice Jackson said, in his
opinion, the decision was the most dis
astrous blow ever struck at the consti
tutional power of congress. It struck
down an important, vital and essential
power of the government. It left the
government, in case of necessity, with
out power to reach by taxation in afly
form the vast incomes derived from the
real and personal property of the coun
try. Justice Brown, in conclusion, said:
"The decision involves nothing less
than the surrender of the taxing power
to the moneyed class. While I have no
doubt that congress will find some
means of surmounting the present
crisis, my fear is that in some mo
ment of national peril this decision will
rise up to frustrate its will and par
alyze its arm. I hope it may not be
the first step towards the submergence
of the liberties of the people in a sordid
despotism of wealth." Justice White,
in concluding, said: "The injustice of
the conclusion points to the error of
adopting it. It takes the invested
wealth and reads it into the constitu
tion as a favored and protected class
of property, while it leaves the occu
pation of the minister, the doctor, the
professor, the lawyer, the inventor, the
author, the merchant and all the vari
ous forms of human activity upon
which the prosperity of the people must
depend, subject to taxation without ap
portionment. The absolute inequality
and injustice of taxation by reference
to population and without regard to the
amount of wealth taxed, are so manifest
that to admit the power to tax and limit
it to this mode, substantially denies
the power to tax and limit it to this
mode ,substantially denies the power it
self, since it imposes a restriction which
renders its exercise impossible." A few
extemporaneous remarks were made by
Justice White after the reading of his
written opinion. He spoke of the deci
sion as a blow at the American people
and said that the power of levying an
income tax now left could only be ex
ercised with such injustice that no leg
islative body would dare attempt to
exercise it, for such an attempt would
bring forward a bloody revolution.

Prof. George D. Herron of the Chair
of Applied Christianity, Iowa college,
whom Rev. C. O. Brown calls an an
archist, has returned from southern
California, where he has been for some
time. "I believe that the people, that
is, the people as a whole, between the
very rich and the very boor," said Dr.
Herron, "are conscious that there must
be a change in the social order. They
are ready for It. if a plan can be put
before them. The Christian consclesite
is awakening. I look for some radical
changes to be begun in the next five or
ten years. There will in that time, I
believe, be a great political revolutloo
looking toward the government owner
ship of all monopolies, including the
great transportation lines, and the
blotting out of the various forms of op
pression now existlnt by the power of
Ihe rich. This, in my judgment. is
coming as certainly as came the aboll
