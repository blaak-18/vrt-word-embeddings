WHAT CAUSED HARDWICK’S
CHANGE OF HEART?
Dear Sir: —Will you kindly tell
through the columns of your Jeffer
sonian what part T. W. Hardwick,
Congressman of the 10th district of
Georgia, took in increasing the sala
ries of Congressmen from $5,000 to
$7,500 per year? Also, why he so
suddenly dropped all efforts towards
the repeal of the 14th and 15th
amendments to the Constitution of
the United States? It was my un
derstanding that he was going to
fight continuously for their repeal,
but it seems that he has been keep
ing profoundly quiet on the subject
of late years.
I have been a supporter of Hard
wick, but want some information on
his record.
Yours sincerely,
ONE OF HIS CONSTITUENTS.
Lincolnton, Ga.
Answer.
In a speech which Mr. Hardwick
made in Congress a few days ago, he
stated that he had voted for the in
crease of $2,500 in his salary. He
argued that the people of Georgia
approved of this increase, citing the
fact that S. A. Roddenberry did not,
in 1908, succeed in defeating the late
Jim Griggs, although Roddenberry
made that point against Mr. Griggs.
Mr. Hardwick further argued that
it was impossible for any man to
live and support his family on the
former salary of $5,000 a year. This
would indicate that the Congress
men are quite lavish with their
money. They are only in Washing
ton about nine months out of the
two years; and more than ia thou
sand dollars per month would seem
to be good pay for almost anybody.
I don’t see how they would go about
spending that much in living moder
ately well. Os course, where a Con
gressman rents a magnificent house,
gives entertainments and goes into
swell society, it is different. But
having lived in Washington myself,
(where in order to secure quiet for
my work and studies, I lived in a
house which I intended to pay for on
the installment plan,) I know from
experience that no such sum as that
indicated is necessary to defray the
expenses of living in Washington.
Mr. Hardwick is one of the Congress
men who carries on his law business,
and who, if I am not mistaken, even
comes home occasionally to look
after it, even when Congress is in
session. In fact, his position as a
Congressman creates a demand for
him in the Court House. Being
popular with the people who serve
on the jury, he can command large
fees. I know of one murder case in
which he informed me that he re
ceived a fee of twenty-five hundred
dollars; and he had little more to
do in the case, as I remember, than
to get the line between two counties
resurveyed.
Mr. Hardwick quoted from the
speech of Alexander H. Stephens,
made in 1873, in favor of the in
crease of Congressional salaries up to
$7,500. That bill came to be known
as “the salary grab”; and, almost
without exception, those who voted
for it were retired to private life.
Mr. Stephens’s vote was a very severe
strain upon his popularity. The bill
was afterwards repealed. It may in
terest you to know why Mr. Steph
ens thought a salary of $7,500 not
too much. With unconscious vanity,
Mr. Hardwick quotes Mr. Stephens,
as follows:
“Representatives in this House,”
said Mr. Stephens, “ought to be men
of that mental caliber, that moral
caliber, that information, that edu
cation, that virtue, of that trustwor
thiness, of all the qualities that make
men fit for the highest pursuits of
life. The Representatives ought to
be of that character which would en
title him to the highest amount of
wages, if you choose to call it so,
which is given to the highest grade
of skilled labor in the country”.
Continuing to describe the ideal
Congressman who would be worth
$15,000, for nine months’ work, Mr.
Stephens proceeded to-say that this
ideal Congressman should under
stand “the science of Government.”
“This,” said he, “requires study, this
requires labor, it requires an im
mense deal of thought; and, there
fore, if the Government is maintain
ed rightly in the Senate and in the
House, the rule of fixing the pay un
der the Constitution should be such
as to afford an arena in these: halls
for the virtue and talents of the high
est grade in our country.”
I fully agree with what was said
by Mr. Stephens. Men of the highest
character, mental caliber, mental
greatness, thorough education, men
who understand the science of Gov
ernment, who devote themselves to
the study of great economic and gov
ernmental questions, who labor un
remittingly for the public welfare,
and who, in the public service, de
vote an immense deal of thought to
public questions, and who carry into
the arena in these halls virtue and
talents of the highest grade, are
cheap at. $7,500 per year. If people
could get such Congressmen and keep
them on the job, I would not grudge
them a salary of $25,000 per year.
They would be worth it to the coun
try. Whether Mr. Hardwick, or any
other member of the Georgia delega
tion, resembles the picture of the
ideal Congressman which Mr. Steph
ens drew, when defending the in
crease in salary, is a question which
I have not the time, at this moment,
to discuss. First, get before your
mind a fair conception of the kind of
Congressman which Mr. Stephens
said would be worth $7,500, and then
apply the measure to Hardwick,
Charles Edwards, Gordon Lee, Tom
Bell, or any other member of the
bunch.
Mr. Hardwick appears to be amus
ingly unconscious of the fact that, in
bringing Mr. Stephens to the support
of himself, he impliedly says:
“I, like Mr. Stephens was, am the
kind of man he pictured as an ideal
Congressman, worth $15,000 for nine
months’ work. Just examine me
with care, and you will find in me
all the virtue, the talent, the culture,
the profound thought, the knowledge
of the science of government which
the Sage of Liberty Hall would en
title a Congressman to an advance of
$2,500 on a $5,000 salary.”
If Hardwick makes a few more
breaks like the circulation of that
©fye Jeffersonian
Thetus speech, and this of Mr. Steph
ens, he will have a ripple of laughter
running over the whole State of
Georgia.
So far as I recall, Mr. Hardwick
did not agitate the repeal of the 15th
Amendment after his first term.

AS TO LOCAL TAXATION FOR
SCHOOL FUNDS.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I would like
to have your advice on local taxation
for school funds.
Please advise in your next Jeffer
sonian. Yours truly,
Hampton, Ga. J. R. BROWN.
Answer.
I have not given this question any
special study, but it occurs to me
that, where property owners are bur
dened with the regular State and
County taxes, which, of course, in
volve the taxes for the common
school, that it is adding very great
ly to their burdens to compel them
to pay a special tax in some particu
lar neighborhood. The tendency of
the town and county tax is steadily
toward increase: the road tax is also
very galling, in some instances: the
tribute that has to be paid to the
school-book trust is tremendous, —
especially when we remember that,
owing to the fact that somebody in
authority gets <a “rake-off”, the
books are changed so frequently. To
pay taxes to keep up schools gener
ally, and then to pay another tax
to keep them up locally, looks very
much like double taxation to me.
Where those who don’t own prop
erty can levy that burden upon those
who do, it bears a striking resem
blance to paying for what you want
with somebody’s else money.
WHY THE TARIFF CAUSES HIGH
PRICES.
Dear Sir: —I am interested in this
“high prices” question, and from
your writings I would think that you
lay the cause of high prices on the
present tariff system. If so, please
give me, through the weekly Jeffer
sonian, your views on the question;
and state, or illustrate, just how the
present tariff law is the cause of high
prices.
Thanking you in advance, I am,
Very truly yours,
D. BROWN TYLER.

true, there was a shortage of more
than two million bales, and there
fore it was the most natural thing
in the world that, in obedience to
the great law of supply and demand,
the price of the staple should ad
vance. The one explanation of the
advance in the price of other things
is that Congress passed a law which
gave the trusts the power to charge
more for what they were selling. The
Tariff wall, which was already so
high that the foreigner could only
come here under the most burden
some terms, cannot now come so
easily as he then could. Inside the
tariff wall, the monopolies simply
hold the people up. With their cold
storage system, they can create a
scarcity even where Nature has been
bountiful. For instance, it was dis
covered that in New Jersey, turkeys,
chickens, etc., had been on ice more
than a year; they were perfectly
black. Beef and hog products, mut
ton, etc., have also been frozen and
stored away by tons, in these cold
storage establishments. Millions of
