THE BURDICK CASE.
The inquest over the Burdick murder
in Buffalo, N. Y., is at an end, but the
mystery of the crime is still unsolved.
"i he detectives and head of the. police
cf Buffalo assumed that Burdick had
been murdered by a woman, and on this
theory they caused the arrest of a Can
adian girl who had been in the employ
of the Burdick home several weeks and
wvio is handsome. It was an outrage,
but the same detectives again blundered
by shadowing every woman having ac
quaintance with the Burdicks. It was
not uritil they had theorized bewilder
ingly that they abandoned the women
and reached the conclusion that a man
was the murderer. It appears that Bur
dick, who was a millionaire envelope
maker, and his wife did not live happily
together. Mrs. Burdick had become
enamored of Arthur Pennell, a lawyer
of wealth and prominence, whose wife
and Mrs. Burdick were great friends.
In the course of time the relations be
tween Mrs. Burdick and Pennell
dawned forcefully on Burdick, who, af
ter forgiving his faithless spouse several
times, on her pledge of fealty to him
withheld a divorce proceeding. The
scandal soon became public and such a
"rare bit" afforded unlimited scope to
gossipers. After the police had aban
doned the woman theory, they rested
their suspicion on and shadowed Arthur
Pennell, who, they held, had a particu
lar interest in the removal of Burdick,
and this plea they emphasized after
Pennell had been killed while automo
biling with his wife, when the machine
becoming ungovernable ran over a cliff,
Pennell was instantly killed and his wife
died a few hours after the accident. The
theory of suicide was set up by the
same police authority in the absence of
something better.
Such, in substance, is te case which
has scahdalized the public, and the close
of the investigation when Mrs. Burdick
was compelled to disclose her -relation
ship with Pennell, has left the murder
of Burdick unsolved. The police failed
to estallish Mrs. Burdick's guilt in con
nection with the murder of her husband.
That Mrs Burdick wss faithlesk is too
true. That Mrs. Pennel was cognizant
-of her husband's infidelity may. not be
questioned, but that she had intended to
divorfe herself frons Penoll and marry
Burdick or that the two women bad de
sitped a Jeag bxchange of husbands, is
a tfeture of the case.which may be ac
cepted with the greate t 'degree of al
lowance. The very thought is, revolting
and shatters the confideince of man in
woman. Unfotunately Mrs. Pennell is
beyond cat an therefore can not re
ffste such reflections, but it is fair to as
_staine that she was -a woman who had
prized her virtte beyond price and all
iaflueine. It is sufficient to say. that the
details of the ease are hocking, and the
sensationalism has heeen aggravated be
caise al concerned were prominent in
social ife an had great .wealth. Such
a case in the scale of the ordjnary class

proceefings of a police :court, It is the
standing of -the persons implicated that
has given it spice and aff.rded the wid

According to press reports women of
good repute and leadeis in society

It is, reported that former" United
States Senator "Jeemky" Jones will
tender his resignation as chairman of
the National Democratic Committee.
He expects to be appointed by the
President os one of the two civilian
members of the Panama Canal Com
mission.-Farmerville Gazette.
"Jeemsy" Jones is alright; Jones has
been slated for the job as indicated by
the specitl to the Picayune dated \Vash
ington, D. C., as follows:
It is almost a certainty that ex-Sen
ator James K. Jones of Arkansas will
be appointed to a place on the Isthmian
Canal Commission. Today a number of
1Democratic senators, who have no can
didates of their own, called upon the
President as a mark of respect before
leaving for their homes, and took occa
sion to recommend Mr. Jones' appoint
ment.
"The President would rather not
name Mr. Jones for this important po
sition, but he feels that the place has
been pledged, and he can not see his
way clear to name another. When the
contest on the canal bill was fought in
the Senate a year ago, and the Panama
advocates believed that desperate means
should be employed to save them from
defeat, overtures were made by Repub
lican leaders to Senator Jones for his
vote. He was the chairman of the Dem
ocratic National Committee, and by the
party platform was pledged to the Nic
aragua route. Senator Hanna, labored
with him long and earnestly and at
length overcame his scruples, anda it is
said since that the gentleman from Ar
kansas was promised an appointment
on the new commission. To the surprise
and disgust of his Democratic 'col
leagues. Senator Jones.gave his vote for
the Spooner amendment. Since then,
whenever the President has taken up
the names of candidates for appoint
ment on the commission, he has been
reminded by Senator Hanna that Sen
ator Jones must not be overlooked.
"The President will not nominate
this coniinission, it is thought, until
after his return from the West early in
June. In addition to Mr. Henry G. Hes
ter of New Orleans, whom he would
like to give an appointment, he has un
der consideratidn the name of ex-Sen
ator Harris of Kansas. Mr. Ha-ris is
an engineer, and while in the Senate
was a member of the committee on isth
mian canal, Ex-Governor Sayers of
Texas is thought to be out of the race,
but Tennessee and Georgia have can
didates for. the commission." -'
CAMPAIGN ISSIUES.
It looks now like the Democrats in
this.State will be called upon to line up
in the next State campaign on the ques
tions of curtailing the patronage of the
governor and the ado¢fion of ýtimaties.
The oil thing lacking just ibw is or
ganizatios,. There is enough -of senti
ment in the.State to "warrant a sys
tematic0organization of the forces fav
oring these reforms, and a definite line
of action should be decided upon. The
man who will lead in this movement
will render the State good service and
reap a reward worth having. The issue
is not office, but principle. The time for
a change in the policy of the pemo
cratic party in Louisiana has come, and
the issue must be met. The struggle
will be -a- hard one, but victory can be
achieved.-Mansfield Journal.
The issues upon which all candidates
for offices from governor down to con
stable will be expected to line on will
be' made plain. The people are ypposed
to the terms of succession or of logical
conclusion. Because a man has been a
steady feeder at the public crib is no
reason why some other equally good
man should be excluded from the feed
ing. We are interested more in the issue
of a return of all power to the people
than, in any projected or prospective
candidate for any. office whatever. We
believe in the rule of the people, by the
people, and for the peoeple.
SENTIMENTAL GUSHERS.
Many ex-Confederates are getting as
tired of the sentimental gush used in
alluding to them by politicians as are I
the Mississippi farmers of the term 1
"horny-handed sons of toil," etc. The I
"brave old warriors" are, as a class, sen
sible, substantial citizens and are not
used to taffy. They did their duty in the
great struggle-no more, no less. They I
made a record of which they are not 1
ashamed, and they feel that it can be re
ferred to in a more fitting manner than
by theidulgence-of superflnous adje
tives, especially when isntended as an
empty compliment.-Mansfield Journal.
As remarked a few days since br the
Caucasian, the old warriors appreciate
kindly words, but will not be misled by
the vaporings of sentimental gushers.
The Vicksburg Herald says Hon. I
Robert H. Snyder of Tensas parish may I

Volume of Water Pouring Through
a Wide Crevasse.
ROAIUING OF TORRENT
The Same Is Heard Five Niles and
the Inhabitants of the Missis
sippi City Are Dreading
Final Outcome.
Greenville, Miss.. March 28.-A vol
ume of water sixteen feet deep and
over six hundred feet in width is
pouring steadily through a crevasse
in the levee five miles south of here
and is flooding thousands of acres of
the finest farming land in the cele
brated Yazoo delta, regarded by many
to be the most fertile soil in the
world.
The break in the levee occurred at
11 o'clock Friday morning and the
roar of the rushing waters can easily
be heard in Greenville. Only 200 feet
of the embankment gave way at first
and a mighty 'effort wic made by hun
dreds of laborers in charge of the gov
ernment engineers to check the rush
ing flood 'by cribbing and sacking, but
it was soon apparent that it was be
yond human power to successfully
combat the resistless fury of the tur
rent. An hour later it was seen that
the ends of the levee oh either side
of the crevasse were melting fast, the
force of the current cutting the em
bankment awae as though it were built
of sand.
When the first report cf the break
reached this city the excitement was
intense and many people began to col
lect their valuables and held them
selves in readiness to. move away at a
moment's notice.
The situation has grown worse for
Greenville. Work on the protection
levee through Main street has been
abandoned and water has reached
Washington avnue, thfe highest point
in the city. Appeals for help have
been coming in all night from the
Washington avenue ,the highest point
boats are being sent continuously to
their relief. The news comes from
these additions that people were seen
clinging to roofs of,houss and rafts to
escape.
Another break on the Mississppi side
is reiorted in the Albemerle levee in
lower Issaquena county, but infor.Ia
tion from there is that the damage
from this break will not be heavy as
the country was already partially in
undated and the rise of water will ne
cessarily be accompanied with little
force.

that fell on his legs, and as the dames
were rapidly bating their way to where

in order to extricate the victim before
the fire reached him, began sawing
his leg, it being the only way in which
to get the. nan away from under the
timber. The flesh had been sawed
t-hrough to the bone when the flames
got so hot that attempt had to be aban
doned, and the man was burned to
death. The other two who yost their
livds were killed by the collision.

Flowers and his son John were killed
Friday morning in Monroe county,

gun. Allman sent word to the county
seat, anid obtained warrants for the
arrest of the men. Constable Witt
was given the warrants and summon

Flowers boys were absent and he de
termined to attempt to arrest the oth
lers. As the posse appeared they were
fired on. Shots were returned, Witt,
killing thy elder Flowers with a re
