Grateful Thousands proclaim
V inkgaii B itters tho most wonder
ful Invigorant that over sustained
tbo sinking system.
No Person can take theso Bit
ters according to directions, and ro
main long unwell, provided thoir
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wasted beyond repair.
Jlilious, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are bo
prevalent in tho valleys of our great
rivers throughout tho United States,
especially tlioso of tlib Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Rod, Colo
rado, Brazos, Kio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobilo, Savannah, Ko
anokc, James, and many others,*
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entiro country during tho
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of tho stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In thoir
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful iniluence upon theso vari
ous organs, is essontially necessary.
There is no cathartic for tho purposo
equal to- D r . J. W alker's V inegak
H itters, as they will speedily removo
tho dark-colored viscid matter with which
tho bowels are loaded, at tho sarao timo
stimulating tho secretions of tho liver,
mill generally restoring tho healthy func
tions of the digestive organs. t
Fortify the body agaiiist dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
Y in kg a k B itters . No epidemic cau
take bold of a system thus fore-armed.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, iicad
ache, rum in the Shoulders, Coughs,
Tightness of tho Chest, Dizziness, Sour
Eructations of tho Stomach, Bad Tasto
in tho Mouth, Bilious Attacks, Palpita
tion of tho lieart, Inflammation of tho
Lungs, Pain in the region of tho Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
aro tho offsprings of Dyspepsia. Ono bot
tle will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scrofula, or King's Evil, Whito
Swellings, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled
Neck, Goitro, Scrofulous Inflammations,
Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Soros, Eruptions of tho Skin,
Soro Eyes, etc. In theso, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, W alker's V in
egar 1J ittkrs havo shown their great cur
ativo powers in tho most obstinate and
intractablo eases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of tbo Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Dladder,
these Bitters havo no equal. Such Dis
eases aro caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases.—Persona
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Typo-sottors, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, aro sub
ject to paralysis of tho Bowels. To guard
ngainst this, take a dose of W alker's
V inegar B itters occasionally.
For Skin Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter, Salt-Itheum, Blotches, Spots, Pim

worms, Scald-head, Soro Eyes, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scurfs, Discolorations of tho
Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or «attire, aro literally
»lug up and carried out of tho system in a
short timo by the use of these Bilters.
». Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, aro effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges. no anthelmintics will freo tho
system froni worms like theso Bitters.
ForFenAleComplaints, in young
or old, marjed or single, at tho dawn of
womanhood^ ortho turn of life, theso Ton
ic Bitters <5#splay so decided an influence
that improjFement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Dlood
whenever »-ou find its impurities bursting
through tiio skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores ; cleanse it when you /Lncf it ob
structed and sluggish in tho veins; cleanso
it when it is foul ; your feelings will toll
you when. Keep the blood pure, and tho
lie, 'Util of tho 6yst.em will follow.
