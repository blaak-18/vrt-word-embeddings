Poplar Springs Industrial School
I OUR YEARS ago the people of
Poplar Springs community,
eight miles from Dublin, Ga.,
became ashamed of their one-
F
room, unceiled, ugly, uncomfortable
school building and erected a two
room building in a beautiful grove
near the old site. The new house
when completed
was pretty and
cost SI,OOO.
Many of the
good people griev
ed because they
listened to idle
tales of others and
built such a com
modious house be
cause they said,
“We have no use
for the extra
room.” One teach
er,. was all they
needed or could
have, they thought,
and so they had
only one, the first
year.
A graduate of
the State Normal
School of Georgia
was called upon to
succeed the teach
er who had work
ed faithfully sin
glehanded with
eight grades. Number two refused
absolutely to accept the - position
without another teacher who was as
capable as herself. She refused also
to have anything to do with the
work unless patrons would build an
industrial cottage and allow indus
trial work to be carried on as she
saw fit to direct it. With many
doubts and fears, patrons built the
cottage at a cost of S3OO. . They had
some faith in teachers but none,
whatsoever, in their tools until all
had been tried.
Since the beginning, another class
room, at a cost of S4OO, has been
built by patrons; a nice new piano
has been in the school for a year; a
music teacher employed. The music
department has been a valuable ad
dition.
Grounds have been cleared and
fenced; pictures placed upon the
walls; maps procured; a library has
been put in.
A garden spot has been fenced and
cultivated; flowers and vines have
been planted. Everything possible
has been done by teachers to make
the school attractive, beautiful,
homelike.
Neatness, order, punctuality, hon
esty have been stressed every day.
Children have helped willingly to
make the school a happy refuge and
they love the place so much that
teachers haVe to send them away in
the afternoons. Many people have
come from a distance to see that
cooking is really done; that a lady
can saw and hammer and build gates,
and shelves and tables. All wonder
how so much outside work can be
done and pupils can do more literary
work than formerly.
When the school opened, some of
the best people were planning to
move to town to educate their chil-

ready gone. Now, at the end of
three years, the school is the social
center and all faces are turning to
wards it. The struggle for teachers
and a few faithful patrons has been
hard. Less than half dozen people
have practically carried the load,
while many more have received the
benefits which the school afforded.
Patrons are now raising fifty schol
arships at sl3 each to help make sal
aries secure for another year.
Teachers do not dare tax them be

to accommodate four teachers and a
dozen or more students who would
like to live at the school and do their
own work. *
Teachers planned from the begin
ning to live at the school and have
quarters for all pupils who care to
do likewise.
The time has arrived when they
are in desperation for lack of funds
with which to carry out original plan
because the work will be crippled in
the future unless a home can be pro
vided. Water is convenient because
the best hydraulic ram made has
been installed at the foot of the hill
and brings water from the bubbling
spring below.

a good investment do so and help us
