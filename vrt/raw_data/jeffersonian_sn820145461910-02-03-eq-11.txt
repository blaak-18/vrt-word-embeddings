FARMERS’ UNION PAGE
Annulled
Dear Comrade:—The resolutions
of the Coffee County Farmers’ Union
adopted December 18 th and pub
lished in The Jeffersonian so stirred
up’’ the Union City nest that J. L. Lee
called the Union people of Coffee
county to meet him in Douglas the
20th inst., which was done by a
goodly number. After quite a
harangue in vain efforts on certain
lines we were called on to rescind
those resolutions. I took the posi
tion that they were adopted by a
legalized meeting of the county and
nothing short of a meeting of the
same kind could alter or rescind
them. Upon a call by Mr. Lee it was
found there were only three locals
present having the present quarter’s
dues paid, hence no quorum, where
upon Mr. Lee declared the charter of
the Coffee County Farmers’ Union
annulled. So by the mouth of one
man we went dead, too dead to skin.
I hope each local and county Union
in Georgia may stand as firm as old
Coffee stood and surrender their
charter rather than be governed by
such men as now’ head our order.
John’s futile effort to shield Boden
hamer was a dismal failure. John
said that to discuss the Ship Subsidy
measure inside the Union would be
partisan because one of the great
parties indorsed and the other op
posed it. I ask John did we not
have the right to discuss men and
measures in our Unions and if this
Ship Subsidy was not a measure.
Such bosh as they would try to gull
down the throats of our people is
indeed shameful.
Well, Tom, I want you to just
keep right on hitting those mission
fanatics with God’s truth as you
have been doing, knowing of a truth
that God is with you; also that the
great mass of the plain followers of
the lowly Nazarene is with you. Yes,
Christ told His disciples to begin at
Jerusalem; so I say begin in Georgia,
in every nook and corner in Georgia
teach and educate our own, then
spread our wings and fly to other
fields. But no, were this done many
fat jobs would be lost and somebody
who sits up and draws a fat salary
might have his bread to eat by the
sweat of his face. Not only the
Mission question, but unearth cor
ruption in every department, sparing
not Union officials or any one else,
knowing of a truth that the boys are
with you to the end. Let those who
would make the temple of the Lord
a house of merchandise be driven
therefrom.
I inclose you list of subscribers.
Yours for truth and right,
T. C. ALLEN.
Broxton, Georgia.
Says D. J. Neill Sold Out
Friend Watson:—l see that D. J.
Neill is hitting you, and I want the
Texas brethren of the F. E. and C.
U. to know what manner of man
Dave is before they allow him to dis
rupt their organization. Dave was
born and raised in this, Nevada,
county, and was a rantankerous
Pop. We carried the county many
times, and our friends, the enemy,
saw they must have more votes, and
Jeffersonian
bought D. J. Neill for the sum of
fifty dollars. Os course, Dave is
worth many times that much now,
to the exploiters of labor, and from
what I hear he has made the sale,
but the boys in the trenches should
not allow him to deliver the goods,
and I most sincerely hope they will
not.
It is far from pleasant to me to
make this statement, for I had hoped
that Neill would conduct himself in
such manner as to merit the confi
dence of the people that have honor
ed him. You can have all the evi
dence, as to the above statement,
you want, and I authorize you to use
this in any way you choose.
Sincerely your friend,
OLIVER S. JONES.
Prescott, Ark.
Facts
Where does the cotton-grower
come in, where do the farmers of
Georgia and the South come in,
when our young millionaires, whose
wealth has been drawn from every
city, tow’n and village in the coun
try, use their millions to help beat
down the price of cotton? When the
men who pose as leaders in church
work, and mission work, and in
building up the South, men whose
names are prominently identified
with many movements intended for
the uplift of the country; I say, when
such men as this go into the New
York Cotton Exchange, and in times
of troubled market, turn loose un
limited selling orders, joining the
bears in their fight against the
South and its imperial product, w’hat
conclusion are we to reach? We had
thought that bear raids of this sort
were always led and boosted by
Northern men. We never before
knew of such a raid, in which the
leading bear was a Southern man.
We thought the South had had its
share of hard luck in the past half
century, and that we were now com
ing into our own, with cotton at 15
cents and all good enterprises on a
boom. We felt like congratulating
ourselves that we were born and
reared in such a splendid country.
But it seems that we are not clear of
our troubles. It seems that we have
a traitor in our midst.
New York cotton slumped $lO a
bale last week, or $100,000,000 on
the last crop of cotton, while the
Southern market went demoralized,

Resolutions of Colquitt Coun
ty Farmers’ Union
We, the officers and messengers of
Colquitt County Farmers’ Union, to
the President of the United States
and members of the Senate and
House of Representatives respect
fully represent medium
First. That we view with alarm
the efforts that are being made to
retire or destroy the money now in
circulation known as the people’s
money, and to melt into bullion the
silver dollars now in circulation in
the United States which are now per
forming the functions of a circu
lating.
Second. We feel that there is no
justice in the retirement or destruc
tion of these, and that the substitu
tion of a bank currency therefor
would be injurious to the nation be
cause it would place in the hands of
the banking classes the power to
contract or expand the medium by
which payments are made and by
which values are determined.
Third. We further believe that
the exercise of such a power by any
one class can but be detrimental to
the masses; therefore we respectfully
urge that these moneys be not with
drawn, but that the issuance and
coinage of same be continued in such
sums as will meet the increasing de
mands of commerce.
Respectfully submitted by Colquitt
County Union.

SO FAR, SO GOOD.
The pastor of a small country flock
was generally accounted a rather dull
and prosy preacher. Returning from
market one day with a small trout,
he accosted a neighbor.
“Good morning, Jones,” said the
minister; “let me show you a fine
trout; I’m using these for brain
food.”
“Th-th-that’s a nice little f-f-fish,”
was the reply, “but what you really
n-n-need, elder, is a wh-wh-whale! ”
