An Accident.
O. Duvernet, the well-known

serious accident last Monday. He
happend to pass by the baggage
car just when it was being unloaded

i'ig it very much and causing an
exceedingly painful wound. Dr.
J. F. Mouton was called and gave

that he will not be able to resume
his work before four or five weeks.

motion for a new trial, which was
taken under advisement.
The Excursion.
The way some persons misbe
haved on list Sunday's excursion
would have been a disgrace to any
country claiming to be inhabited by a
civilized people. Unless these
hoodlums can be compelled to re
spect the ladies, it is about time to
let people know it, for no decent
man will feel safe in bringing along
with him on an excursion any lady
member of his family. Excur
sions are, as a rule, disorderly, but
the one given last Sunday was the
worst. A crowd of toughs, kept
running through the cars, yelling like
Indians and making all the noise
possible. The only way to pre
serve the peace on board an excur
sion train is by detailing two men in
each car for that purpose. If some
thing of this sort is not dokle, ladies
will have to abstain from going on
excursions in the future.
Some citizens of Rayne also dis
tinguished themselves when the
trian reached their town. They
wanted to bombard the train with
ammunition on a par with their repu
tation and they very properly se
lected rotten eggs, which were
thrown at the excursionists through
the windows of the cars. At or
near Crowley we are informed that
a pistol shot was fired at the train,
the bullet passing just above the
head of one of the passengers.
Brick-bats were also thrown against
the car-windows promiscuously. It
is to be hoped that the authorities
of Acadia parish as well as the of
ficials of the Louisiana Western will
take the proper steps to discover
who are the culprits guilty of these
cowardly acts.
The Pelican's Ball.
The ball given Saturday by the
boys of the Pelican Brass Band re
cently organized under the leader
ship Prof. Henri Gerac, was a splen
did affair socially and a sucess fi
nancially. The large hall of Mr.
Falk was crowded with fair ones
fom this town and adjoining coun
try and generous and handsome
young men. The arrangement
committee, headed by the indefati
gable Louis Lacoste, had done -its
duty well as nothing was lacking
for the pleasure of all
present. At the usual hour the
ever-faithful Landry band signaled
to the dancers that the ball would
begin. A large number of couples,
with Miss Cecile Fortune and Louis
Lacoste in the lead, placed them
selves in position to participate in
the grand march. The other
dances listed on the program were
played by the band, which fully
sustained its reputation for good
music. At the request of the com
mittee we publish the following card
expressive of its thanks to those who
so liberally volunteered their assis
tance toward the success of the
ball.

ASSESSMENTS. -
The Louisiana Western's Asses
ment at $7000-Others Re
duced-Ilow It Was Done.
A very interesting meeting was held at the
court-house last Mondoy. It was composed
of the commisioners appointed by the Police
Juries of the several parishes to fix the as
sessment on the property of railroad, tele
graph and telephone companies doing busi
ness in the parishes named below.
Capt. J. C. Buchanan was elected chair
man of the meeting and D. A. Cochrane se
cretary. The latter gentleman also acted as
notary and administered the oath to the
members.
The roll was call by parishes as follows:
Avoyelles, J. B. Hudson, Calzasieu; J. W.
Bryan; Iberia, J. A. Provost; Lafayette,
J. C. Buchanan; Jefferson, L. I-. Marrero;
Rapides; C. J. Barstow; St. Landry, not re
presented; St. Charles, J. W. Frelson; St.
Mary, W. P. Brown; St. Martin, E. A. Du
champ; Terrebonne, A. M. Dupont; Acadia,
P. S. Pugh.
Act 9g of s888, creating the board and
defining its powers, was ordered read for
the benefit of the members.
The first matter that came for the consi
deration of the board was the assessment of
the Western Union Telegraph line. Mr.
Fenn appeared as the repre sentative of this
company and made a statem ent concerning
the valuation of telephone lines. He stated
that the average cost of building telephone
lines was $82.96 per mile. The assessment
on this line as fixed by the board last year
was $5oo per mile for the first wire and $25
for each additional one.
Mr. Frelson moved that the assessment be
fixed at $zoo for the two first wires and
912.5o for each subsequent one. Mr. Iu
pont offered as an amendment that the as
sessment be fixed at the same rats as last
year. After some argument pro and con
Mr. Dupont changed his amendment so as to
fix the rate at $zoo for the first wire and
$92.5o for each additional one. Dupont's
amendment was defeated and Mr. Frelson's
motion prevailed.
Mr. Marrero then stated that inasmuch as
the authorities were meetingcwith much dif
ficulty in collecting the taxes from this com
pany and at the instance of the attorney
general, it would ube wise to recommend
that the assessment for last year be reduced
to the figures fixed for the ensuing year.
After an animated discussion the improprie
ty of such a step was made clear, and Mr.
Frelson's motion was withdrawn.
The assessement of the Morgan's Louis
iana and Texas railroad which runs from
Alexandria to New Orleans was then taken
up. Messrs. Randolp Natili and Juluis
Kruttschnitt who~epresented this company,
made short statements in which they ask the
board to fix the assessment on their road at
he same figures that had been fixed on the
Texas and sPacific and Mississippi Valley
roads; claiming that unless this were'done
they would not be in a position to compete
with the said roads. These remarks gave
rise to a heated talk, incidentally bringing
out the fact that while the railroad was very
anxious to get a reduction of its assessment
it was not prepared to carry out Blaines'
doctrine-reciprocity-by a reduction of
freight charges.
Mr. Hudson moved that the assessment
on this road be fixed at $65oo per mile, and
Mr. Dupont offered as an amendment that
it- remain at last year's figures $7000 per
mile. The question being put to vote it was
carried by the following vote:
For $65oo0-Provost, Bryant, Marrero,
Hudson, Frelson.
For $7000-Duchamp, Dupont, Buchanan.
By motion of Mr. Marrero the branches
on this road were assessed at $3500 per
mile. Mr. Dupont here entered a protest
against theraction of the board in fixing the
assessment of the Houma branch, claiming
that only the representative from the parish
through which this branch runs was entitled
to vote on this question. The chairmain had
decided this point in favor of Mr. Dupont
but his decision was not sustained. Mr.
Dupont insisted upon the right to fix the as
sessment on this branch, and he fixed it at
the rate of $4000 per mile.
At this stage of the proceedings, Mr. P.
S. Pugh of Acadia arrived,- and was sworn
in. Judging from the way Mr. Pugh than
died the question of the assessment of the
Louisiana Western, it is safe to say that had
he been present at the beginning of the ses
sion he would have infused more life in the
deliberations of the board.
The next thing in order was the assess
ment of the Great Southern Telephone com
pany which was fixed at $30 per mile. Mr.
J. J. Fowler represented this company.
The assessment of Mr. IIogsett's Teche
and Vermillion Telephone line was reduced
from $3o to $S5 per mile.
The Louisiana Western Railroad now oc
cupied attention of the board. On this
question only the members of La fayettte,
Calcasieu and Acadia were entitled to vote,
these being the parishes through which this
road ,runs. At one time it seemed as
though the three members would fail to ar
rive at any clonclusion, each entertaining a
different opinion. Mr. Pugh presented an
argument of considerable force and ability
in favor of raising the assessment to Sto.
ooo while Mr. Buchanan thought $700oo0 fair,
and MIr. Bryan contended that $5500oo was just
and equitable. After a heated discussion
between Mr. Pugh and Mr. Kruttschnitt,
and Judge Parkerson, Mr. Bunchanan's mo
tion was adopted.
The Midland or Eunice branch was asses
sed at $37,o5o per mile. Mr. Pugh was the
only member who had a voice in the fixing
of this road's assessment, and this explains
the reason why it was assessed $250 above
the other branches.
The Iberta and Vermilion road was asses
sed at $3500.
The meeting then came to an end.

THE ELECTION CONTEST.
Quite a Stir Created by the Re
port that the Registration
Book had been Lost.
Chas. Puckette was in Lafayette this week
taking evidence for Judge Beatte in the elec
tion contest case. Col. I. D. Moore repre
sented Mr. Price. -No intimidation or ir
regularity was proved during the investiga
tion. The testimony of R. B. Martin a de
puty registrar, caused quite a sensation. lie
testified in substance that the registration
book of the parish had been placed in the
hands of Mr. Jno. Vigneaux and while in his
possession it had mysteriously disappeared,
and for that reason he (Martin) had failed to
produce it as requested.
The incident created quite an excitement
among the people, especially the Democrats
who considered that it would likely create
the impression that they were instrumental
in its disappearance. Inquiries were im
mediately made about the whereabouts of
Mr. Reau, and it being ascertained that he
was out in the country taking assessments,
the Democrats sent for him to apprise him
of the occurrence.
He reached town early Friday morning
and before the examination of the witnesses
was'resumed, he had already found the
book, and the incident has evidently lost all
effects which could, in any wise; be injurious
to the reputation of our parish for honest
elections.
49th Birthday.
Mr. Ernest Constanstin was 49
years old Saturday and the way his
young lady friends showered bou
quets and other nice things upon
him was enough to make a younger
man turn away with envy. A num
ber of Mr. Constantin's friends met
at his home to wish him a continu
ance of the prosperity and good
health, with which he has always
been blessed, if one is to judge
from his robust appearance at an
age when most men begin to feel the
weight of years.
The Dust.
Much has already been said
about the many diseases that may
result from the inhalation of street
dust and all persons know how in
jurious dust is to the health, yet we
see no really sincere effort made by
the people of Lafayette to procure
street sprinklers to destroy this
spreader of disease and great in
convenience. In order to impress
the people of this town with the
seriousness of this dust question#
we reproduce below a part of an
editorial which appeared in that
able periodical, the New Orleans
Medical and Surgical Journal,
edited by the most learned physi
cians in the Crescent City. The
Journal says:
"To the laity, dust is a nuisance,
a thing to be got rid of on account
of its inconvenience; to the physi
cian and sanitarian, dust is a thing
to be treated seriously, since it is
the most potent carrier of the con
tagion of the disease that annually
numbers its victims by the millions
-consumption. It is not such a
very long time since dust began to
receive attention at the hands of
bacteriologists; the labors of these
men are rapidly bringing the pro
fession to a realization of the im
portance of dust as a carrier of di
sease. When the bulk of the pro
fession appreciates the matter fully
the laity will be gradually taught
the dangers that lurk in street-dust,
and take measures to lessen them.
A few years ago, a praiseworthy
"missionary" effort was made by
Dr. T. Mitchell Prudden among
the laity, in the publication of a
little work in popular style that set
forth in plain language the way in
which dust served as a spreader of
disease. This effort, which stands
alone, we believe, was a movement
that should have been followed up
by Boards of Health and plysi
cians all over the land."
KILLED
By the Cars-Lee Escobal Meets
a Horrible Fate.
Thursday* morning Coroner Gladu re
ceived a telegram from Scott stating that
the mutilated body of a man had been
fosndt on the railroad track near that place.
The coroner immnediately left for Scott andI
proceeded to investigate the case. Lying
near the track were the remains of a man.
Closer investigation disclosed the fact that
about three-quartersc of an arpent further
west was a small pool of blood with blood
stains leading to the place where thie body
was found. The pool of blood is supposed
to be the place where the train ran over the
man andt it is thought that the bodtly was
subsequently dragged by a train going the
opposite direction. At first the coroner
was at a loss to identify the dead man. iut
found on his person a note book containing
the names of Cleophas i'Prejean, Onezine
herant and L. P. Cltenon, all three citizens
of this parish. These gentlemen were noti
lied of the accildent and were asked to go to
Scott ani try to identify the body if poss
Thursdlay morning Coroner Gladu in
formed The Ga.:ette that .Ir. Neraut hadl
reco:gnized the body of the unfortunate man
and gave his name as .Lee Elscolal, and
stated that he was f-om Iioustont w-here his
mother is living. Mr. Nerant hald met Es
cobal at Carencro whiere he wais in search
of employmc:ent for hitmself and mother.
The Gazette reporter learned from a pas
senger on Tuesday night's west-lbound train
that condriuctor Archie had put a man off at
Scott for failing to pay his fare. The man
was suffering very much from disease and
was exceedlingly weak and it is likly that he
fell under the wheels in the attempt to
jump on board or ,threw:v himself under the
car in a moment of despair.
The coroner lnad not held the inquestoup to
Thurslay owing to the absence of conductor
Archic, whose testimony is deemed tne:es
sary.
Another Version.
'i'he Gazette has received the following
from a cdrresportdent at Scott:
The aian who ids killed here last night
has been identified as Lee Sclobard, who
has recently lived on Itarrington's place
at Indian Bayou. lie was killed by the
cars 50 yards from where has body was
found. A goiod sized pool of bloold marked
the place wher e he was killed. A sunguiir
feature of this case is that his bt-ly was
dragged over the mtnain line fully 50 yards
\\';i-uout bering touched by the car wheels.
It looked as if the boiy had been laid on
i the side of tl:e track by human halnds, in
stead of beitig thrown i1o thd er'r5;
