WHEN I GET INTO BED.
-
I’m never frightened in the dark,
Though I am very small;
1 never sit all scared and hark
For orgres in the hall.
But when my prayers are said
I have one awful dread,
That something waits to grab my toes
When I get into bed!
1 try to think of pleasant things
Each time I get undressed;
And how each day no evil brings
If children do their best.
But the thought comes in my head,
As I’m turning down the spread,
That something’s going to grab my
toes
When I get into bed!
And when there’s nothing more to do,
With bedclothes open wide,
It makes me shiver through and
through
A-trying to decide.
Which foot shall go ahead
Cause I’m sure I’d tumble dead
If something ever grabbed my toes
As I got into bed.
—Burges Johnson in Harper’s.
The Golden Age tells the following
story:
“At the breakfast the biscuits were
rather harder than they should have
been, land Jones growled out:
“ ‘I wish I were an ostrich. Maybe
I could eat these biscuits and live aft
erward. ’
“ ‘I wish you were,’ said Mrs.
Jones. ‘Maybe then I’d get a few
feathers for my hat.’
This reminds us of another story.
A young husband came home and
found his bride of a few weeks in
tears. “What’s the matter, my
dear?” he asked. “Oh,” she said,
“the dog has eaten the biscuit!”
“Why, never mind, my dear,” he
replied soothingly, “I’ll get you an
other dog.”
BRYAN IN 1924.
When Mr. Bryan was notified in
1916 he made his paramount issue
the regulation of department stores;
in 1920 he demanded the defeat of
the Republicans because of the miser
able way in which they had enforced
the smoke ordinance. But in 1924,
when a great concourse had gathered
in front of Fairview, Mr. Bryan tot
tered out upon the porch and said:
“Fellow citizens, the paramount
issue this year is ‘me.’ I am getting
to be an old man. I should be put
ting aside millions for my family
faster than I am. I cannot afford to
take the time from my lecture
engagements to run for President.
The phonographic business, which I
unfortunately started in 1908, has
proved a mistake. The people have
been so familiarized with my voice
they won’t cross the street to hear
me at a dollar a throw. I have had
to cut rates for the first time in my
lecturing career. It is up to you,
neighbors and fellow citizens, to' elect
me this time. I hereby renew my
pledge of 1900, 1908, 1912, 1916 and
1920 not to be a candidate for a sec
ond term.” With a mighty cheer for
the Peerless One the meeting broke
up.—Minneapolis oJurnal.

Say, Mr. Farmer!
Never before in the history of our
country has there been a time when
scientific farming received more at
tention than it is receiving at the
present time. It behooves every man
selecting farming as an occupation to
avail himself of every opportunity to
keep abreast of the time. It is also
necessary for his wife to know the
•‘ins and outs” of her department—the
home —in order that both may work
systematically. It is every man’s
duty to post himself in all the differ
ent features of farm life and to do so
he must have the right kind of litera
ture. His wife must also have some
thing for her department, and to
these ends the Texas Farmer, a week
ly larm journal, stands without a peer.
This journal should go into every far
mer’s home every week. For the pur
pose of putting it there we are going
to make an unheard of offer, an offer
that will not hold good after October 1
because the price and what we offer is
too ridiculously low for us to continue
it and make good.
We will send the Texas Farmer and
the National Home Journal, both, one
year for 95 cents; the publishers’ price
being $1.50. As an inducement for you
to hurry in your subscription we will
give to each of the first 7,000 sub
scribers one share in a well we are
going to bore for oil in an oil district
on on a 2,000 acre lease. If we get oil,
both the lease and the well will belong
absolutely to these 7,000 subscribers
and will mean at least one or two
thousand dollars to each of them.
If the oil is found to exist in paying
quantities a company will then be or
ganized by us and each subscriber is
to pay in sll more. One of which is
to go to us for our part in carrying
the proposition through to a success
ful issue, and the other ten is to go
into the treasury of tne new com
pany for developing purposes; in other
words, to bore more wells on the lease
and conduct the business of the com
pany in general. The well does not
cost v.ie subscribers one cent. We are
depositing with the First State Bank
of Dallas, to the credit of a trustee, 35
cents out of the amount received from
every subscriber for the purpose of
boring the well. If we get oil, and
we are going to bore in an oil district,
each subscriber’s share will be worth
one or two thousand dollars and he
will not then mind paying in the
other sll which will develop it and
make it worth much more to him.
REMEMBER, WE ARE AFTER
THESE 7,000 SUBSCRIBERS AND
WANT THEM WITHIN THE NEXT
SIXTY DAYS and will send these
papers at this price until November 1
in effort to get them by that time if
possible. Don’t lose any time study
ing over the matter, as the well does
not cost you one cent unless we get
oil, and if we do strike it just sll is
all it will cost you afterward. Only
one share is allowed to one person,
which makes it a “square deal” for all
alike. Hurry in your subscription to
day and both the papers will be sent
you for one year and also a certificate
f'" your share in the well. Send
money by any safe means, but no pri
vate checks will be accepted unless
ten cents is added for collection.
Hurry up and get in on time.
