Editor» Caucasian :
Being a great lover ot poetry, 1
would urgently request you to re
produce in your columns the auli
joined touching lines, which I find
In the La. Democrat of the i£9th ult..
dedicated to the memory of a little
boy, and written under the name of
Wm. J. E. Ryau, of the new Parish
of Yeruon, who is, I believe, a Pro
fesAor of some Educational Insti
tute there. But for a lew excep
tions the poem would bo faultless.
For instance the fourth line of the
» first stanza does not preserve the
melody, and the word 4< gladness "
in the second line following does
not harmonize with the sentiment
ot the piece, like " sadness " would.
These and perhaps a few other ex
ceptions might be named, but we'll
pass them over :
To the Memory of the Little Boy that
Died.
Thea* linen are dedicated to tlie memory
at JOHN A WlklFREK, eldest »on of I m »«
O. and Louisiana Winfreo, who died at
Leeaville, Vernon Parish, on Wednesday,
the 15th day of July, 1874, at 10 o'clock
f. M., aged five your* and six mouths.
TO THE LITTLE BOY THAT DIED.
BY WM. J. E. ICYAN.
I am alone in my quiet study now,
And the midnight hour in near—
The lamp'« dim light aud the clock's dull
tick.
Remind me of the quiet and gloom ;
And o'er m.v soul in its solitude
Sweet feelinjjs of gladness glide,
For iny heart and iny eye« »re full when
I think
Of the little liny tlmt died.
fVe «hall mim him when the flower* come.
In the gardens where he played—
We shall niins him more by the fireside,
u When the flowers have all decayed.
We'll see his toys and his empty chair,
And things he loved so well :
And they will speak, with silent speech,
Of the little boy that died.
We shall see his little sisters again,
0 With their playmates about the door.
And will watch the children in their sports
As wo never did before :
°And if in the group, we see a child
That's dimpled and laughing-eyed
We'll look to see if it may uot be
The little boy that died.
We shall no borne to our Father's house.
To our Father's house in the skies,
Where the hope of oursouls has no blight,
Onr love no broken ties;
We shall roam on the banks of the rjvoi
of Peace,
And bat he in its blissful lido
And one of the joys of our hruveti shall be
The little Hoy that died.
And now, Messrs. Editors, will
yon please give place also to the
following poem, which I find in my
old scrap hook, and which I clip
ped from a newspaper and inserted
therein ere the war began, some 14
or 15 years ago. Tlic author is a
distinguished writer whose name is
'familiar to the reading public
throughout England and America.
I simply wish to show how much
great writers think and write alike.
Here is the piece as I clipped it
from the paper years ago. I» con
clusion I would sity that if Professor
Ryan wishes to write any more
dedicatory poetry, over his own sig
nature, iny " Scrap Book " is at his
service : T.
TUE LITTLE BOY THAT VIED.
The late Dr. Chambers is said to have
been the author of the following beau ti
li nes, written on the occasion of the dea'li
ot a young son. whom lie greatly loved ;
I am all alone in my chamber now,
And the midnight hour is near.
And the faggot's crack aad the clock's dull
click
Are the only sonnds I bear s
And over my soul, in its solitude,
_ Sweet feelings of sadness glide ;
For my heart aud eyes are full when I
think
Of the little boy that died.
I went one night to iny father's house—
Went homo to the dear ones all.
And softly I opened the garden Kate,
Aud softly the door of the hall ;
My mother came to meet her son—
She kissed me, and then she sighod,
And her head fell on my neck, and she
wept
For the little boy that died.
I shall miss him when the flowers come
In the garden, where be plaved ;
I shall miss him more by the fireside
When the flowers are "all decayed ;
I shall mise his toys and bis empty «hair,
And the horse he used to ride.
And they will speak with a silent speech
Of the little boy that died.
We shall go honu to onr Father 's house—
To onr Father's house in the skies.
Where the hope of soule shall have no
blight,
Onr love no broken ties.
We shall rnam on tbo banks of the river of
peace,
And bathe in Its blissfn] tide.
And on« of the joys of life Bhall be
The little boy that died.
When the wife is detected show
ing unusual affection tor her hus
band, it way fairly be expected that
she will appear before long iu a new
bonnet.

IC STATE CENTRAL COM
MITTEE.
THE STATE CONVENTION CHANGED
TO BATON ROUGE.
To Honorable Em iff La Sere, President
and member» of The Démocratie, »State
Centrât Committed«/-Louisiana i
Gentlemen The Committee of
Seventy, which for nearly two year«
has been waging ceaaeîea« warfare
ngninat the infamous usurpation of
Kellogg, in view of the approaching
election which will nfford the people
an opportunity to rescue the Slate
from the Radical rule, nnd considering
that no patriotic hand can remain idle
In this eonflict, has deemed it neither
foreign to the purposes of ils organiza
lion nor inconsistent with its past ca
reer to aMutne a decided attitude with
regard thereto, and to take its place
in the line which is forming to light
the battle of Louisiana's redemption.
At a very large meeting of the Com
mittee held at its rooms in tili» city,
on the evening of the JJOth July, ult.,
after the fullest discussion and inter
change of views, the resolutions which
accompany this letter were passed by
a very large majority.
To tlie impartial mind there can be
no miscoustmcti'Mi of the tenor and
purport of these resolutions. They
unqualifiedly indorse the address issu
ed l»y your body, and pledge the com
mittee tu issue to the peoplo of the
State an address, urging them to heed
your call, anil tosend delegates to the
Convention convoked by you, no mat
ter where that Convention may as
semble.
Having, in the strict and legitimate
lino of your duly, already issued your
call in terms so lilteral, catholic and
broad, tlmt any and every opponent of
Radicalism and negro supremacy in
Louisiana may unite in your conven
- . -— - f ..
lion, the Commit tee of * f ' °j
»ee raune for division and dissension
Through your Convention, nnd under
your call, the full volume of conserva
tive will in Louisiana may be voiced ;
nnd when that will is uttered every
true-licaitcd son ofLonisiatia will yield
and obey.
But the Committee of Seventy is not
insensible to the fact that your cail for
a Convention at New Orleans has ere.-»
t( d dissension and division in the minds
nnd hearts of many good ami able men
in the Slate, whose patriotic devotion
to its interests cannot bo questioned;
and several country journals, echoing
this feeling, have united in another
call for a Convention at Alexandria.
In reflecting upon the action of your
comiuittee, some of these journals have
been so unguarded in language and un
fortunate in temper as to utter unkind
words and ungenerous charges agtinst
the Democracy of this city.
The uxo of such language, by men
towards men, where hearts should be
so drawn together by common misfor
tunes and oppression, is most sincere
ly to be regretted.
But we ask that all this be forgotten.
Let it be atributcd to that intensity
of feeling and expression which wilt
sometimes escape the lips and arise to
the hearta of men who have suffered
much, ami are Buffering still, nnd whose
deep anxiety to escafie Hint, suffering
cause them to feel and think and speak
in the strongest manner.
The chief objection urged to your
action is that the place for the meet
ing of the Convention convoked by
von was fixed at New Orleans.
derm this a most unimportant objec
tiou ; but yet the objection exists, mid
strongly in the minds of many good
men in the State.
The Committee of Seventy earnestly
and respectfully asks that you remove
that objection by calling the Conven
tion at Baton Rouge.
I feel assured that auch action in
your part will heal all division an<l
jealousy, and that all the conserva
tives of the State will then be united
in on« Arm, unbroken, and therefore
invincible array in this mighty conflict,
upon the successful issue of «hielt the
destiny of our beloved State depends.
With profound conviction that your
action will be guided by the highest
dictates of «luty and patriotism, we are
with great respect, very truly pours,

of
of
(»resented by the committee

"Whereas, the Radical party has
made the issue one of race and color,
and by their actions whenever in pow
er, bo violated every idea of political
equality and justice as to compel eve
ry white man of respectability to with
draw fron» that party.
Resolved, That we accept the situa
tion and organize ourselves into a
Whit« Man's Party, representing to
onr fellow citizens of the State, an as
sembly of the Caucasian race, who are
not sorry they were born wldte, nor

born edueated white citizens as equal
to those of any other color.
Resolved, That we particularly urge
upon our fellow citizens the necessity
of complying with the law iu regard to
registering and voting.
liesolved, That we believe all the
nets of the present Police Jnry tobe
illegal, nnd the only possible excuse
they can offer for their unwarrantable
acts, is their ignorance nnd the influ
ences of Register nud other Parish of
ficials.
Resolved, That we will only nomi
nate and vote for such men to fill our
parish and State office*, nsare capable,
houest nnd thoroughly identified with
the interests of our country.

Since our last we must report a still fur

As wo assured onr readers. Captain Lick
Sin not, with I iis indomitable energy se
cured a good boat to come out lust Satur
day io the place of the Sabine, lie char
tered the Durfee, which boat, arrived here
in good time last Monday, with one of the
finest freights of the season, aud we were
glad to meet the old familiar faces of the
llicers. belonging to onr packet, trade.—
Captain Aiken, was iu command, as Cap
tain S., remained in Now Orleans, to hast.
the repairs on the Sabine. He will
leave New Orleans with the Sabine to-day
nud we hope notwithstanding the low
stage of the river, that, his tine packet will
arrive here soon enough to be greeted by
his numerous friends on Monday.
Captain Mitchell, true to his ad verfise
nieut.camenp iu handsome style on Thurs
day evening with the stattlich low 1 water
boat, Flfta, she has been thoroughly reno
vatcd and looks as bright as a new pin.—
Captain M., has entered the Grand Ecore
trade, and says he has "come to stay !" He
is well know I to onr readers, many of
whom have travelled with him ou the' St.
Mary, and remember him as a polite cour
teous gentlemen, aud attest to his effici
ency as an officer. Two good boats so
well officered ought to make business
pretty lively, but competition is the life of
trade aud we believp there will be busi
ness enough for both packets.
The Uryaly for Shreveport on her first
trip this season, and with a tine freight
! passed up, Tuesday morning She han
ia lighter in tow and will doubtless use
it several times before she reaches her
destination. She hung ou a bar several
hours just at the lower end of the reach
and iu sight of town.
Texas passed down Sunday with a light
trip and will lay up until better times.
Lotus No. 3 passed down Wednesday
morning, nothing in sight, aud she too
will lay up aud wait for morn water.
The Carrie a. Thorn is due down to-day.
Tom Reeder, well knowu in onr trade is
her chief clerk.
The Fleta goes down to-day on time.
The weather is excessively hot, no
rains this week to oool the atmosphere,
and the thermometer standing way up in
the nineties.
Reports of the crops are still flattering,
need raiu in somt sections.
Cotton is opening rapidly and picking
will have commenced pretty generally all
over the Parish next week.

To accomplish the following desirable ends: 1st. The extinguishment of all debts _
which may now bo due by the Association. 2nd. The erection of suitable buildingH
for the Mechanical and Agricnltuaal products exhibited, and for the protection of
stock—the Directors have adopted the foregoing plan, which seems to them tint Only
feasible and pract ical way of raising the necessary funds. In proposing this scheme the
Directors do not disguise from themselves the difficulties which must attend its
execntioii ; but reposing their confidence iu the worthiness of their aims, they ;){,>
peal to the sympathy and pride of the citizens, especially of this aud our sister par
ishes, and to every public spirited Louisiauian. to come forward and aid an enter
prise, whiclijse' ks only to build np and develop the resources of onr t»eloved State.
The object of the Association is to create a renewed interest among all class»'« of
our citizens in our coming Fair, and at the same time, by ofH'ring large inducements,
to stimulate the sale of its tickets to an extent that will enable it to realize an
amount adequate to its pressing wants. The plan of The Association is to issue 2".
000 tickets at seventy-five cents a ticket—the price of admission to the Fair, with »
coupon attached bearing a nunilier: the said ticket entitling the holder to one adi
mission to the Fair, the ooupon being retained by himself.
