Sbay and not a vestige of the steamer
. remains.
a Her managing owner, the captain, the
Spurser, three engineers, two abiebodied
, seamen and a stowaway, were drowned
Sand the balance of the crew of 34 were
saved by the pluck of an unknown mem
ber of the ship's crew who swam in the
raging sea from the wreck to the light
ouse with a line around his waist.
The ship Alpha was valued at 045,000.
Her cargo comprised 750 tons of salt
salmon and 350 tons of coal consigned to
Tokohama and valued at $80,000. The
total insuranoe on the ship and her car
go was *65,000.
It is two weeks uinee the Alpha first
