emnlipi us, and forms of civilization, be
come extinct, but always to give
phlac to something highle, something
nobler. Triith only, is stable, on
changed, and unchangeable.-"'for the
eternal yeats of God are his." Far
back in the dust and dlakness of the
ages, it glitters like a star, glowing to
fuller elifilgenee of glory when Christ
the true law-giver came. Even in
the time of Moses, the world was not
prepared for its fullest light, for
Christ himself tells us thus and thus,
lie said to you, "because of the hard
ness of your hearts," but I say this
the human race, had progressed, they
were prepared to become the recipi
ents of new truths, yet the Divine
Redeemer says when about to depart,
'"I have many things to say to yon,
but you can not bear them now, when
the comforter is come, the spirit of
truth, hlie will teach you all things."
Two thousand years more have pass
ed aay ; brighter gleams of light,
parting the clouds of error and wrong
in golden lifts, have come streaming
in upon the darkened earth. The
tyralnnly which made one man the
satve of another, is fast passing away,
and thie great brotherhood of love is
being established. When pestilence
or famine desolate a land, loving
hands from iheyond thel, great oceans
are lifted to aid; the common pulse
if ihumanity beats in sympathetic
unity. Meni are growing up to the
grantdeur and loveliness, and glory
ot the living Christ. The church ins
shaiking from her garmients the dust
and cobwebs of superstition and er
ror, and prer and more spiritualized,
breaking down her partition walls,
and going'hack from the traditions of
nietu, to the oracles of God.
With larger wisdom, and increas
ing light, uimn fel the law of God
written upon their learts, they know
that they violate them, they do it
knowingly and consciously, and that,
according to the natural sequence of
events, the liroken law must have
its penalty- they may deceive their
fellow-men, butt they can not hide
themselves fiom the all-seeing eye of
God. A good man nnat be a moral
man, buIt a moral man, need not of
necessity be a good man.
"As a man sows, 80 must hie reap."
It is the hiat of eternal justice. For
instance, a man becomes a drunkard.
lie could not help knowing from the
first step his danger, but he brings
ruin and disgrace upon his offspring,
he transmits the fatal tendency to his
descendants as certainly as he does
his temperament and his features, ie
fosters in his own bosom the undying
worm of remorse, and he violates
every law of his being-must not such
a man reap the harvest he has sown t
It may be, that in some moment of
renewed strength, stung to agony, he
resolves by the help of Heaven to
turn from his downward course. God
accepts and pardons, his fellow-men
receive him, but alas, still "as a man
"sows, so shall he retp." As well place
'he hand in a blazing torch and e
pectitn ~ill not buin, astothink to
turn back the horrible thing which
has taken its .downward course to
blight and destroy, that "the sins of
the fathers shall be visited upon the
children to the third and fourth gene
ratibn," is an axiom in morals as it
is in ntature. It is this which gives
sln its monstious magnitude, as well
as its dire ingratitude. It is this,
which shonld niake a man desire to
purify himself, to make himself at
temple in which to adore the
High.

Step by step the desert is made.
ani when onte on wise habit is foriniid,
no mlatter how small, it is time 1to
pause and tltn back. When we so
fleet that the toys of the present age
are to Lecole the ownirs and gov
ernors of the next, when we think of
thie gr.antd inherit anle tihey rie to
step into, whuat wonder that we look
at them with solicitude. "The hiv
is father to the man," and it depends
upon us what they are to become.
All lthe aggregated wisdom of
Prophet, Seer, and Sage, all the grand
developments of Science and the
splendor of tlh Atts, all will be theirs.
Hlow will they lhe fitted, not only to
nmake the most of these great gifts,
but to carry on the noble works of
evolution ? Mothers, it depends
much upon yon-your haund will sow
the first seed. Manuy a twig which
nome careless foot has crushed, with
fostering care would have grown up
into a straight and noble tree, whose
branches, the winds of !leatven would
have swept like a seraphs harp, so a
careless act, a seemingly trifing omis
sion may givee to tie young mind
placed in your charge, a wrong direc
tion-a system of evil training may
tarn it down ward forever.
Make truth the basis of character.
No really noble structure was ever
raised on any other, and to do to do this,
be yourself truthful, and consistent
never promise, more or less, than
you intend to perform, and insist on
perfect and implicit obedience. One
half the punishment children usually
receive is for following the example
of the parent. God chooses well his
instruments, nature never makes a
mistake.
Nothing but the intensity of moth
er love could lead to the sublime
self abnegation, the perfect evotioln
which to the honor and glory of
womranhoodl, we see too often dis
played ; and this is why, because her
hand ows the first seled ; because her
bosom will feel the first sword-thnot
if the son of her loves goes amiss,
that she should look well to her steps.
What mother who feels this at all,
does not feel that she needs the aid eof
Divine wisdom and strength ? When
your little one rays at evening his
little enrly head upon your lap to re
peat the prayer to which angels lis
ten, place your hand there, and ask
it; sure that no earnest desire tor
light was ever denied ; sure too, thst
liHe who led hlis people of old will
guide your loved one afely through
the devious ways of mortal life.
Woman and her nirssion has not
been forgotten in lthe grand progress
ive march of tile ages. Lifted from
her false position as slave and idol,
she takes her place on the grand
arena of life, prepared to do her
work nobly and well, to be really trhe
companion and helpmeet of man, to
round out and complete his being
and her own. But believe me, her
grandest triumphs are not won tupolr
the state of public life, thre pulpit or
the rostrum. Therehe h belittleds
herself, for she steps aside from thre
grand work committed to her care.
s the wife of a noble and good man,
as the mother of future Poets, Priests,
and Philosophers, she finds her prop
er sphere-there is here enough to
gratify the proudest ambition. Co
rinne wore her crown of laurel over
a breaking heart, but white-robed
angels listen to the cradle song of the
