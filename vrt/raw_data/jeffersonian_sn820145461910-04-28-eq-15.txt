A CERTAIN CURE
FOR
CANCER, DROPSY and all
Kinds of BLOOD DISEASES
Mr
In this day of specialists when
every man makes a specialty of some
subject, it is naturally evident to the
lay mind that a Cancer, Blood and
Dropsy Specialist is a man that has
made a specialty of these subjects.
If you are a sufferer of Cancer,
Dropsy or any diseases of the blood
you would not consult an oculist
would you? Then, if you are afflict
ed with any of these dreaded dis
eases, why not consult a man whose
remedy first cured himself, and was
then offered to the world? This
remedy is manufactured and sold by

Say of Other Editors
Here is a tale of high cost of liv
ing that goes straight to the heart.
It is told that a farmer selling a
dressed hog to a local butcher de
cided to take part of his pay in trade.
He ordered a ham and two sides of
bacon and then asked the dealer how
much he had “coming.” While ap
parently having reached a result, the
butcher scratched his head and the
impatient farmer again demanded,
“Well, how much do you owe me?”
“Don’t owe you anything,” replied
the butcher. “You owe me a dollar
and eighty-five cents.”—Winona Re
publican and Herald.
Almost every paper in the State of
Georgia has commented editorially
with favor on the jolt that Congress
man Roddenbury has handed the Re
publicans as a beginner. He has
struck at the root of the evil, to be
gin with, and in doing so he forges
to the front not only with his home
people, but with his colleagues and
his constituents. Editor Mercer, of
Fitzgerald, hits the keynote when he
said that Roddenbury’s first effort
amounted to more than has been
done by many other Congressmen
who have been in the national hall
for years.—Press, Thomasville, Ga.
Beer is supplanting sake, long the
national drink of Japan. That really
looks American, but we will have to
do more missionary work before
near-beer will do as well. —Eagle,
Clemson, S. C.
It is funny about this Tom Watson
business. Some folks abuse him for
opposing one man and praise him for
opposing another.—Dublin Dispatch.
Tom Watson seems to be the tar
get for several big guns just now.
But Tom generally shoots back, and
when his gun goes off it makes a
noise that causes the folks to “sit up
and take notice.’ Hawkinsville
News.
Senator Hale now adds his name
to the list of old line Senators who
have decided to retire. Is the popu
lar condemnation of the actions of
these men causing them to give up
the fight?—Weekly Times, Kearney,
Neb.
If Tom Watson hits the thing we
oppose a great and mighty man is
he. But if Tom hits the thing we
are for then he is a demagogue, a
malicious liar, and everything else
mean that we can imagine.—Cal-
houn Times. Truer word was never
Writ. —Ga. Free Lance, Lindale, Ga.
It is reported that President Taft
is tired of his job and will not be a
candidate for renomination. This is
not surprising. The political up
heaval in the country and the do
nothing policy of Congress, the fail
ure of his party to keep its promises
to the country, are enough to dis
gust any President. President Taft
is out of place in the present condi
tions. He is not strong enough to
dominate his party, and is too prone
to compromise and vacillate to please
any element. The Republican party
is too much under monopoly control
to command the confidence and re
spect of the voters in the present
temper, and with open revolt on
every hand, a stronger President
would - find little encouragement.
President Taft, the easy going, com
promising, joking and vacillating, is
a deplorable ihisfit in these serious
and strenuous times. —Index, Dover,
Del.
A STINGING REBUKE.
There was one paragraph in pai’ticu
lar in the platform adopted by the
Indiana Republican State Convention
which must have stung President
Taft and the Aldriches and the Can
nons to the quick.
3tftersoniaik
The paragraph to which we refer
was not appreciated for its full worth
by the press generally. Therefore
we repeat it:
“We believe in a protective tariff
measured by the difference in the
cost of production here and abroad.
Less than this is unjust to American
laborers; more than this is unjust
to American consumers.”
The Republican national platform
also promised tariff revision on the
basis of equalization of the differ
ence in the cost of production at
home and abroad. The promise was
insolently ignored. The men who
framed the Payne-Aldrich law made
not the slightest effort to live up to
the platform promises, not even at
tempting to ascertain the difference
in the cost of production at home
and abroad.
The public at large, unfortunately,
was not properly educated on this
point, as the newspapers generally
paid little attention to the fact that
the tariff makers did not attempt to
revise the Dingley rates on the basis
of equalization of cost of production
at home and abroad.
But Senator Beveridge was aware
of the perfidy of his party. There
fore the clause in the Indian plat
form indorsing a revision on the
basis of the difference in the cost of
production here and abroad was a
stinging indictment of President
Taft and every other man who has
sought to make it appear that the
Payne-Aldrich law is an honest ful
fillment of the promises of the Re
publican party.
Had the tariff jugglers lived up to
the promises contained in the Repub
lican platform of 1908, 90 per cent,
of the Dingley rates would have
necessarily been reduced one-half.
But such a Reduction would have
interfered with the monopolies en
joyed by the tariff trusts. Therefore
it was found expedient to forget the
pre-election promises. The joke was
on the people again.—Kansas Com
moner, Wichita, Kans.
