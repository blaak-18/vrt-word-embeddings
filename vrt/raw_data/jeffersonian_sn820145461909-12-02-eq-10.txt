FISH
Drop us a card, and we will put
you on to something, with which you
can turn your neighbors green with
envy, by catching dead loads of fish,
where they have become disgusted
trying to catch them in the old
fashioned way. It is inexpensive,
and will only cost you a postal card
to find out what we say is true. Now
is the season for all varieties of cat
fish and suckers, and with our meth

NOTICE—CORNELIA CLUB!,
A meeting will be held at Corne
lia, Ga., on Friday, December 10th,
at 7:30 P. M., to organize a Jeffer
sonian Club. All those in favor of
reform, irrespective of party, are
urgently requested to be present.
Throughout the South and West
these clubs are being formed by
thinking men of the white race, who
nut duty to their country above their
allegiance to party. If you realize
the crying need for reform; if you
'ave at heart the vital interests of
our beloved South, come to this
meeting.
NOTICE—MONTICELLO CLUB!
Jeffersonian Clubs are forming all
over our State and nation. Let us
be up and doing. “Eternal vigilance
is the price of liberty.” The sparks
of liberty in a patriot’s breast can
not be extinguished.
It is requested that all who be
lieve in the principles of true Jeffer
sonianism, as taught by Thomas Jef
ferson, meet in the courthouse in
Monticello, Ga., on the first Tuesday
in December at 1 P. M. sharp, to or
ganize a Jeffersonian Club. It is un
derstood that it will be an indepen
dent club, nonpartisan, and in the
Cshe □kffersoftiatt
interest of no party or man. Its ob
ject is to bring together all those be
lieving in, and in favor of reform,
and of those reform principles as
taught by Jefferson, independent of
party or party ties, and who are in
favor of selecting and electing the
best of officials, and of having the
best of laws; w r ho are in favor “A
government of the people, by the
people and for the people”; of
“Equal rights to all and special fa
vors to none”; of just and righteous
laws; of “Law and order”; all those
are invited to come. These clubs
are strictly wffiite men’s clubs, and
will work so as to make our govern
ment a republic indeed and in fact
a white man’s government, as it was
in the days of Jefferson and Jack
son, and will keep a strict watch
over the acts of their officers, both
county, State and national. They
will see that good officers are select
ed and elected, in a nonpartisan
manner. They will see to it, that
the people have just and righteous
laws, and that the people have their
rights. By forming clubs, they can
come together, debate and discuss
the repeal of all bad laws, and the
enacting of such laws as the people
need and want. They can discuss
the merits of officers elected and to
be elected, county, S.tate and nation
al. Let us all who believe in re
form, in Jeffersonian principles,
come together, irrespective of party
or of party ties, in the interest of a
common cause, as patriots, as free
men, wearing no party collar, and
driven by the lash of no party boss
or bosses.
I w’rite this by the request of
those believing in Jeffersonian prin
ciples. JNO. L. G. WOODS.
NATIONAL LEAGUE OF JEFFER
SONIAN CLUBS.
In the Jeffersonian Club organiza
tion the unit is the local club, the
members of which are in complete
control of their own local policies.
In State affairs the local club is sub
ject to the direction of the State
union or league, but the latter Can
not decide upon any platform or
policy until it lias been submitted to
a vote of all the clubs in the State.
The National League of Jeffersonian
Clubs is a union of all the State or
ganizations. It is plain, therefore,
that under all conditions the mem
bers of the local clubs are in com
mand. No action, local, State or Na
tional, can be taken without their
consenting vote. That is Democracy,
pure and simple.
Some time must elapse before a
national organization of this nature
can be perfected, and in the mean
while there are thousands of our
good friends, all over the United
States, who are willing and anxious
to become members. Many of them
live in States where there are few
or no local clubs, and it will take
