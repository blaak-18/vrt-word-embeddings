the Scott school, having recently
been appointed to that position by

Knights of th Mac cabcecs.
The State Commander writes us from L.in
coln, Neb., as follows: "After trying other
medicines for what seemed to be a very obs
tinate cough in our two children we tried D)r.
King's New Discovery and at the cud of two
days the cough entirely left them. WVe will
not be without it hereafter, as our experience
proves that it cures where all other remedies
fail."-Signed F. W\V. Stevens, State Com.

A Big Case.
A negro came to town this week
to retain counsel for a big case in
whiCh he was involved. The sum
of two dollars and fifty cents is de
manded of him to pay for damages
done by his chickens in one of his
neighbors' gardens. It is alleged
that his chickens crossed over the
fence and played havoc in the
vegetables, hence the suit for dam
ages.
A Memorable Day.
Mr. Jean Brun, the well known
carpenter, will remember last Satur
day for a long time to come, not
only because it was the anniversary
of the Fall of the Bastile, but be
cause on that day he was relieved
of a new, crisp fifty-dollar bill. He
does not know how it was done, but
he is sure of one thing: Sunday
morning he was fifty dollars short.

Races at WashingtUdr
Harry Durke returned Monday
from Washington where he had
gone to see some fine races. Nel
lie Bly, Mr P. L. J3eClouet's mare,
did not get the prize, but it was the
general impression at the race
course that she was entitled to it.
She lost the race, not because she
was not the best runner. but because
the "law was agin her." The judges
had no alternative and they de
cided the case according to the
rules which usually govern races.
Cash Item, formerly kept at Mr.
Constantin's stable in this town,
distanced the others in a trotting
race, but a protest was made against
him on the ground that he was en
tered too late, and he was ruled out
after first heat. He would have
been an easy winner.

A Visit to the Photo Car.
A Gazette reporter had the
pleasure of visiting "Eulah" the
beautiful car used as a studio by
Southern Art Company. The car
is specially adapted for the business
and offers to visitors every comfort
of the rich galleries in large cities.
In the well-furnished reception room
are exhibited specimens of the artis
tic and thoroughly finished work
done by Mr. Britain, the affable
manager, and the other artists em
ployed by the company. We
would advise those of our people
who have not already done so, to
visit the car, and if they do not
want pictures taken, they can spend
a little while pleasantly looking at
the many pictures displayed.
A Card Party.
An agreeable card and game
party was given Wednesday*evening
by Miss Lydia McDaniel at the

The Crops
Mr. L. G. Breaux was a pleasant
caller at The Gazette office Thurs
clay. Mr. Breaux informed us that
the crops in his section were doing
fairly well. While cotton promises
a satisfactory yield, corn does not
present an encouraging outlook.
Cane is reported as being in good
condition throughout the parish.

Ex-District Attorney Jos. A.

Damage Suit.
Judge Bowen's court was crowded
last Tuesday. The case on trial
was that of Arthur Patmn vs. Viel
Webre, for the possession of cattte
taken up by Webre, while 'commit
ting depredations in his field. On
the other hand Patin sues for dam
ages on the ground that WVebre had
no right to take the cattle and keep
them in his possession. Webre
claims damages for depredations in
his crops. A large number of
witnesses testified. Julian Mouton
represented Mr. Patin and Mayor
Campbell defended Mr. Webre's
interests. Judge Bowen took the
case under advisement.

A DAY AT BEAUSEJOUR,
The Fall of the Bastile-Fittingly
Celebrated by the People of
the Town and Country.
The celebration of this memorable
event so dear to the heart of every
patriot and particularly so to every
lover of "La Belle France," was
the occasion, last Saturday, of a
most beautiful and enthusiastic
demonstration by the people of our
town and parish. Extensive pre
parations had been made for a
grand barbecue and picnic, at
Beausejour Park, to-be followed in
the evening, by musical entertain
ment and ball champete. At an
early hour the children of the town
reinforced by Judge Meaux's Isle'
Pelette school, fifty strong, gathered
at the court house and there formed
into a grand wagon procession,
with flags and banners displayed.
The procession proceeded through
the principal streets in the following
order:
Grand Marshals Ike Broussard and Henry
Gerac bearing Uni'ted States and French
flags.
Broussard Brass Band.
Patin Band of Scott.
High School division with flags and ban
ners.
Isle Pelette School with flags and banners.
Lafayete Public School with flags and
banners.
Black DiamondMinstrel Troupe in gor
geous costumes.
At nine o'clock promptly, the
parade started and in spite of the
threatening weather, presented the
spectacle of nerrly 300oo school
children in gay dress and still gayer
spirits, intent upon a jolly good
time at the park. It is safe to say
that a more beautiful and inspiring
scene has seldom if ever been wit
nessed in the history of Lafayette.
On arrival at the park the children
betook themselves to games and
amusements, of various kinds, while
the old folks looked on with pleasure
and admiration, breathing silent
benedictions upon the heads of the
young people whose merry shouts
and ringing peals of laughter made
the day one long to be remembered
and cherished. Major Mouton's
well-contrived swings, furnished a
large proportion of the sport and
fun, the little folks often being
quite impatient for their turn to
come.
During the clay refreshments Ice
cream Lemonade, cakes, etc, con
tributed to satisfy the desires of
the inner man. No accident or
unpleasant incident marred the oc
casion and this to the credit of all
present.
At night fire works enlivened the
pleasures of the day, after wnich
the young ladies and gentlemen in
dulged in the giddy mazes of the
dance, to their heart's content. The
solemn hour of midnight was near
at hand,- before the ardent votaries
of Terpsichore concluded with loth
fu: steps to retrace their way home
ward.
Deserving notice should be ac
corded the ladies who labored so
faithfully in dispensing refreshments
and assisting in every way toward
the success of the occasion. The
Five Landry Band, as well as the
Broussard Band and Patin Band of
Scott, contributed their services
without pay.
Last but not least, mention should
be made of Judge Meaux's school,
to which was awarded a beautiful
prize banner for the largest school
representation from the country.
The banner is an exceedingly beau
tiful one, artistically designed and
bears in large gold letters the ins
cription. "U. S. and F. R."
(UnitedStates andFrench Republics)
Judge Meaux's pupils may feel j ust
pride in the ownership of this lovely
banner, and yet it must be confessed
that they richly deserve any token
of honor or esteem accorded them.
Before closing we must say that a
more orderly and well behaved
company of boys and girls, could
not be found, exhibiting the most
sincere respect and inmplicit obe
dience to their earnest and zealous
eachers who may well be proud of
their schools, which reflect so mani
festly the most careful and painstak
ing efforts.
The gross proceeds, while not
meeting expectations, owing to the
threatening weather, were sufficiently
satisfactory under the circumstances
and amount to $x76. The net
proceeds, however, will not exceed
$xoo as the expenses were quite
heavy. The money will be applied
to the Public School building fund.
The committee in charge desires
TheGazette to tender Major Mouton,
Judge Mleaux, the several bands of
music, and those who so generously
loaned flags, freezers, etc., grateful
acknoledgement for their favors.

From Our Regular Correspondent.
-Although rather late, still, the
few light showers that we have had
lately, have somewhat benefited the
crops. ` The prospects, a few weeks
past of the cane crop, was all that
could be desired, but, the continued
long drouth,has considerably injured
that plant. Old farmers estimate
the yield in our immediate cornm
munity, at about half crop.
-One of the best monthly period
icals, that adorn our desk, is the
"Salve Regina," published by the
sisters, and senior pupils of the
New Orleans Dominican Academy.
The subjects treated are extracts
from the gifted pens of the senior
class. In the May number several
good articles were published. We
cannot but mention the poetical
effusion, "a Tribute to Our Queen"
by Miss M. L. of New Orleans.
This instructive monthly should be
in the hands of allCatholic families:
The low subscription price of one
dollar, places it in the reach of all.
-Messrs Blanchard and Caffery,
whose "brave stand" for the Wilson
bill, so "slickly"injured Louisiana's
main industry, received an appro
priate little compliment, from the
last issue of the Breaux Bridge
"Valley of the Teche." The edito
rial is headed "Euchered, "and is a
good one. We would like very
much to reproduce the article but
space does not allow it.
-The Misses Scranton, in com
pany with Mr. Doruengeaux, were
visiting friends in Lafayette Sunday.
-Little Miss Lucia Noll, of
Mississippi city, is spending some
time with her cousins, the Misses
Marjory and Potsy Cade, at "Belle
view Home."
-Say, members of the Glee Club,
when is that picnic to take place ?
-Nothing short about Royville,
but it's treasury's fund.-No taxes,
-no improvements,-nothing.
-Mr. Numa Boudreaux, one of
the veterans of the old Lee Army,
was made happy lately, by the
arrival of a bouncing baby boy.
We congratulate our old friend.
-Mr. Ulysse Broussard, a victim
of that dreaded destroyer, consump
tion, was buried at Royville, Tues
day. The gentleman was a son-in
law of Mr. Estinville Landry, and
very popular in his section. The
deceased leaves a wife and several
little children to mourn his loss.
-Dr. Young and son, Charles J,
attended the 14th of July festivities
at Lafayette.
- Lost or Stolen - A scarf
pin, with diamond. Reward will be
paid for same if returned to J. R.
Domengeaux, at Scranton's drug
store, Royville, or at The Gazette
office.
-Several of our boys were out
fishing at Bayou Tortue Sunday.
-Prof. Webb, has returned to
Royville,and now-conducts a private
school. Mr. "Webb opened Monday
with a fair attendance. We see no
necessity in introducing the professor
to our people, as his stay with us
for the past two years, speaks for it
self.
-A Foster-Fitzpatrick "dicker,"
with "angels and ward bosses," is
the next move on the program.
