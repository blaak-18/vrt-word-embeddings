slous directly due to the question of st
the right and legality of the law. o
Foremost among its opponents was
Green who, as a member of the town
council, considered that it behooved tip
him to convert the oommunity to hies
manner of thinklng. Green has had I
several spirited altercations on the
subject which, on more than one oc
Casion, came near resulting disagree
ably to all concerned.
On the Iatal day he met Gibson at
Haiel's corner, .when a disnssionl
ensued on the question of the ordl *

wlase f reely usee , when both
m , al-most simultaneously, drew
their pistols and opened Bre on each

Green fell to the pavement shot
through the body. the bullet entering
under the right arm and making its
exit at the same point under his left
a ar was taken to his home, and
died at 4 o'clock this evening. Gib
son was arrested.
Green was about 40 years of age, a
painter by occupation, and leaves a
wife and three children. He will be
