Twelve States will hold elections S
before Congress meets, viz: Ore- cl
gon, in Jue ; North Carolina and
Alabama, in August; California, st
Vermont and Maine, in Septem- tl
ber; West Virginia, Ohio, ludi
ana, Iowa and Connecticut, in ,
October. is
The New Orlcalis 1)emorrat has ti
this to say in relation to the war,
Marshal Pitkin is waging on the I
Calcasieu lumbermen :
"The logs are of no value to it
the government, while they rep.
resent a great deal of hard work
on the part of the. cholpel and .
their pillage represents not one
hundredth part as much rascality
as Pitkin, the Metropolitans and
the Customs oficials generally
have been engaged in this State
for years. Upon the whole, we
are for the Turks against the Rus
sians, and the lumbermen against
Pitkin and his ragamuffins ; and
though we can't in prudence bet :
on the Tun ks, we will bet odds
that if Soapsuds Pitkin leads the ]
Metropolitans against the lun
bermen he gets whipped out of
the woods and out of his boots. b
In order that those of our read- i
ers who do not understand terms
used in editorials and telegrams
relating to Turkey, we give ex- t(
planations of the leading ones: A
Sultan-The Sovereign of the ,
Turkish Empire-the recognized si
organ of all executive power in
the State. His head-quarters are tl
at Constantinople. «
Porte-The Government of the o
Turkish Empire. b
Sublime Porte-The official name b
of the Government, so called from
the gate of the Sultan's Palace. ,
Grand Vizier-The chief Minis- y
ister of the Turkish Empire. fi
Diean--The Turkish Council of tl
State-the "Cabinet." S
Grand Mlfufli-Chief Interpreter "
of the Mohammedan law and t'
head of the "Wise Men'--jurists, t
theologians and literati--who as
senmble for consultation on his or
der. lie is mostly styled the t,
Chief of the Faithful. A writer p
says a fetwa. or decree from him ii
wonld summon around tue stand
ard of the Prophet all the ~unati
the death against the "infidels, in is
the firm beliet that death on the
battle field is a sure passport to g
Paradise."
Pasha-Governors, Vice r o y s,
commanders, civil and military a
rulers of Provinces. a
Deys-About the same as Pash- t
as. i
Sheik-The name given the F
heads of Arabian tribes or clans. t
It means elder, or eldest in digni- 1
ty and authority. t
Osmondi-A Turkish official t
Islam-The religion of Moham
i med.
Islatsa - Mohammedans them- i
selves.
Siussublen-A follower of I1o.
,hammed. 1
Ottomen Empire--Anothei' name
for the Turkish Empire, and de
Srives its name fi'om Osman, its
founder.
Osmanlis-The Turks proper.
Not all followers of the Prophet
are Turks. In European Turkey
there are, in round numbers, five
million Mohlammedans, less than
half of whom are Osmanlis, the
-rest being of Slavonic descent,
but none the less ardent worship
ers of Islam.
Southward the MIarch of Emi'
, gration takes its Course.
A colony is in process of organi
dzation in Massachusetts to settle
in Burke county, North Carolina,
while the Irish Catholic Benevo
lent Union of the United States
-and Canada is actively engaged
in colonizing Irish emigrants in
the Western portion of the State.
These are additional indications
Sthat the tide of emigration, which
Shas so long flowed Westward, is
now setting toward the South,
Two new lines of railroad are be
ing constructed through the west
ern portion of the State to centre
at the town of Ashville, and good
unoccupied lands are oflered in
some of the best cotiutie8 at prices
raging from fifty cents toI ten dol
lars per acre.
Few parishes iit Louisiana ate
inferior to the best counties in
North Carolina, while we have
millions of acres of the most pro
Sductive lands in healthy districts
and under the most genial of cli
mates, lying idle. In no State of
the Union can the mnan who la
bors with his own hands, mor
. easily make an abundant living
than in this State.
With thb' same amount of labor

Minister Maynard will now have (l
to assume the role of protector of i;
American Christians in Turkey. The to
Turkish threat of a "general mas- et:
sacre" has doubless some degree of
sincerity.
iMahlstick thinks, it would seem, n
that it is the intention of Russia to
"capture and gobble" Turkey. He
ought to know that Russia is a mighty
bear, and not a mere 'Turkey-gob
bler. It
The Russians are marching in force l
to Giurgevo, Siennitza and Turun
Magurelli, points within a line of
fifty miles on the Roumanian bank of I
the Danube, and opposite lRustchnk,
Sistowa and Nicopolis respectively,
where the Turks are strongly in- et
trenched. The Turks are preparing Pt
to cross from Widin to Kalafat, where so
they whipped the Rusitns un merci- eN
fully in 1l54. It will soon be seen 0o
whether they have strength enough (P
to eflfstually defend the numerous I"
points of attack from on overwhelm. cc
ing Muscovite force.
Hobart Pasha apparently has some la
ýfid,wiff'riftwo n t'w et;w''es a; We rttr" ec
ised, for a Pera correspondent of the at
New York World says: "The Rus
sians have paid particular attention ti
to Odessa,tfor that is their principal ti
port in the Black Sea. Batteries
have been planted all around the bay
and seventy guns aie ready to greet
an invader. The bay itself has been o
thickly stro~,n with hundreds of tor- l
pedoes, and a battery of light guns 1
placed on the outer mole to protect C
the inner lIne of the submarine mis
siles. It is tihe general belief that
both at Odessa and in the mouth of r
the Bug liver, as well as at Kerteli.
the Russians ate prepared to operate f
against blockading vessels with small, A
swift torpedo boats, and will keep a
blockading squadron on the consrant t
look-out for danger."
Tile Turks seemn to have bungled I
badly in the management of their
iron-clads on the Danutbe. The Rus- I
sinus have succeded in blocking up f
the Danube by means of batteries
and torpedoes from Ibriiil to Isniail.
At the forner place the river makes e
an abrupt bend from its northern e
course east before entering the Black I
sea. The Turkish fleet has been for Ia
several days bomnbarding Ibrail f-om
behind an island lying immnediately I
in front of the townI, buit thie I)anube, 1
whihdl has been swollen by the rains,
has subsided and the iron-clads have
had the water slip from under tlhem, I
and it is probable they will have to
bhe destroyed by tlihe Turks to plre
vent their capture. The Dannhube,(
above Ibrail, divides into half a doz
en branches, the channel being on I
: the Roumanian side, where the Rus- I
,sians have strung their batteries, t
and as tile 'I'urklish iron-clads receive
s their esupplies of coal on the Dannhe
I Kustenji and Tchemavode railway,
Sand from Varna by rail to Rustehlik,
Sit is not improbable that the fleet
' would have been in a very tight place
even if the water had not receded.
All the Ministers at Conistantinople
are urging the Sultan to join the ar
my and act the same as Alexander
has done at Kischeneff, but Abdul
Hlamid, thie present Sultan, is too
B shrewd to be caught napping. IHe
i1 well knows that the moment he leaves
a his capital new conspiracies will
8 break out that may cost hiuih his
thione. Intrigues are tlhe order of
the day and should ever the Sultan
get his face toward the army, either
his brother Murad or the Prince Iz
n) idin would at once take his place at
Sthie head of the siiblime Porte., The
) threatening attitudle of Midhat Pasha's
a party, whose chief is now in eile, al
Sso causes tile Sultun to hesitate be
f fore joining tihe armiy. The latter
. party have become of late quite des
Sperate and ready for almost anything.
They would not permit twenty-four
b' hours to elapse, if they saw their way
clear, before calling Midhtt Parsha
Sand installing hini in his tomer place
I as prime Minister, I do not believe,
;e therefore, that for the present there
ts exists the least probability of the
e, Sultan's leaving Constantinople.
Should hlie ever do so, and be antis
Le fled.that no trouble will folloir either
n at the paladeur tit the harem, then
Slook out Fir thlte most boody war on
ill recod, its the presence of tile Sultan
Lt with bie troops will inspire the Mo
u hammedausnn to cruel and atrocious
deeds, all to be committed in a "holy
cause."
According to Mohanmmedan tholo
gy there is a bhldge over hell no wid 11
er than the edge of sword, across ed
which every one who enters heaven II
mlllst iass. The Turks seem disposed a
to fn ssh the Russians with a similar of
bridge acnross the l)anuho when they
attiimpt to pass over into the heaven I
of Bulgaria. as
The Afric'an Mohammedans are re
potted as unwilling even to respond
to the Sanjak Sherif, unless the Sul- i
tan can promise thell plenty of Iplun
der. The Sult tan an possibly assure at
them that they can masacre as many
Christians as they wish. An instance
of this kindly Tuikish employment st
occurred at Turtukai Friday.
The 'urkish funds having given as
ont, the Sheik-ul-Islam has sent a
comnmission to tie Serii of Mecca to St
demand a ,It contribution from the
treasure of Islam, a fund composed
of the offerings of pilgrims at the sli
shrine of the Prophlet, over which the bi
Slherif of Mecca stan:ds gua d. It is lo
unnderstood that when tile Moham
inedan faith is in dan et this treasure st
must be used to defeat it. .As it has of
been aeccn!ulating for 4f2 y:ears, a.
some French writer calculates that
it now amnoucts to $120,0()0,00i. ti
The official report of General Meli- th
koft to the Czar as to the capture of' th
Ardahen shows that the Russians ii
gained a very decided victory with a
comparatively small lo.s of officers fu

CalIrTE, Natchitoches, May 18. '77.
lion. R. M. Lusher, State Superinten- n
dent Public Education : s
Dear Sir-The legally elected Gov- tl
erument of Louisiana being at last
permanently established, with its of
several departments-legislative, ex- f
ecutive and judicial--in successful tl
operation, I venture to submit an in
quiry to your consideration, and res
pectfully beg a reply at your earliest
conven ienlcee.
I write this letter at the request of
several gentlemen who were engaged
last year, like myself in public school
contjline it thb outrinss ulbuer your J
atdlninistration.
You are not pet'htps ignorant of ci
the fact that the State is indebted to al
the teachers here for services render- ti
ed by them during the last year ; in- 1,
deed, for the quarter, from the first ti
Monday in September, 187ti. Not ti
one of them, so far as I know or be- IF
lieve, has been paid. They taught $
under contracts entered into with H.
C. Myers, tile then treasurer of the ,
School Board, who had for several tl
f months previously cashed their war
rants in New Orleans with a kind of c
punctuality. They understood per
fectly well that in refusing to make t
any other but quarterly contracts r
with tlheml his motive was to Ilhave

Off For Europe.
[Dfetroit Free Pres .I
G'eorg Carlysle, a prisoner with ,a
black eye and a desolate look, mount
ed a Ihairel on Jeffi'rsou avenue at
midnight lFr iday night and haranguei
a crowd. The crowd was comoposed
of onii old nman, who was looking for
a soft bed in some( doorway. Mr. Car,,
lysle didn't ask the lone ;old man to
assist hiim to mob the Biddle House;
but lie idl;
"(Gentlemen, I leave for Europe to
morrow to take part in the glorious
struggle or for reedom, truth, religion
and-tud sunthin' do drink. Who
will join mie Y"
The lone old man sat on the curb
stone hod looked around as if he
wonted to jQiu a square meal.
"Thou cowtald !" hissed the orator
as he looked dow upon the crowd.
The old man stared across the
sticet at a patenut hitching-post, and
made no reply.
"'111 begin (tie war right here'"
shouted the orator, as he fell off the
barrel. "S' uare oftf, old man, and
look out for your nose!"
The lone crowd dusted down the
street yelling "murder I" at the top
of his ",icee, UndCarlysle was arrested
as he pursued.
"\What business have you with
this European muddle I" asked the
the Judge, as he looked down upon
the drunkard. "And, further, who
hit you '"
"Fell ag!n a house," was the niouirn
ful repily.
"Lito you want to go to Europe t"
'I'I' like to be counted in when war
rages, your Ilonor.
"You are a nice specimen to be
firound hollering for freedom ! sneer
ed the court. You'd better holler for
soap and water and a clean hLirt.
When did you wash last t"
"Wasn't I around during the last
war!" protested the prisoner. "I
am just aching to be on the skirmish
like along the Dan-a-be."
"You'll be aching to get out of the
House of Correction before your sen
tence expires. I'm going to make it
sixty days."
"Very well, quietly replied the
man. "I shall stay up thereo just
seven minutes by the atcli, and
then run the guard and take the first
train for Europe."
''Write me from Kalafat or Erzer
ouim, and don't give we any more in
formation," remarked the court, and
that ended that case.

Juinel, auditor. Judge Rogers, of
the fifth District court, yesterday de
cided that act 98 was unconstitution
al insofar as it appropriated any por
tion of the funds to the payment of
persons not members of the legisla
ture, and no validity attaches to cer
tificates or vouchers so issued. This
aict, it will be remembered appropriate
t $12,500 for pay mint of tile mileage and
per diem of returning board members
who were not elecled on the face of
1 the returns.
Thie attention of the court was
called to joint resolution No. 130;
which provides for the payment of
c the mileage and per diemu of persons
returned as elected by the returning
a board, but not so elected, aud not en
1 titled to seatsi, etc.; and tihe court
C remarked, "it i6 to my 1 mind very
t clear since I have been referred toi
this joint lesolutiou No. 130, that no
n power exists in the general assembly
Sto award iayinmeimt to persons tor set
Svices as particular State oficers who,
Sby the provirions of the resolution it
r self, are ldeclared not to be entitled
(i to such olice."
SIn this case the relator asked that
e the auditor be compelled to issue
e warrants for ceritin vouchers whichl
Y hle held. The court ordered thie man
danius to isuic, cinipelling the aidd
S itor to v'arrant fior all of the vouch
ers except those issued to t. 1. Haui
n lett and E. L. Weber, who were re
turned by the returning board, but
Swhlo werti not elhcted.
