Yellow Fever Treatment. bt
[Correspondence New Orleans Picayune.] pl
On the 23d of August, 1867, during tli
the prevalence of this much dreaded
malady, I published an article in the be
New Orleans Republican, for the bl
benefit and instruction of strangers tIl
and persons not rcquainted with the sc
disease and its ploper treatment,
i u hich met with the approval of the thi
best physicians. Dr. Schmidt, presi- fo
dent of the iloward association, had w
:.evera)l hundred copies of the article se
struck off and sent up to New Iberia m
to be distributed among the people in
lwhere the fever raged with great w
violence at the time. Hearing that iA
the disease has again made its ap- ei
pearance in our mlidst, I propose to er
publish a few suggestions which may hI
be ben eficial to unacclimated per. h
sons. In all my experience with yel- e'
lew fever I have never known a case ai
that did not 3 ield to proper treat- hi
iuent, although I have heard some si
physicians expiess a contrary opinion. hi
Whenever a person dies with what is ci
thought to be one or two days illness, bI
tile p;.tient must have had the fever
in his system for days in a latent
form. This form is the most dan
getous because it comes unawares,
and, therefore, is not apt to be at
tended to in time. Every pnacclima
ted person is liable to take yellow
fever here during the summer or fall
months. Sometimes it comes ear
lier than others; one can never feel
secure until after frost. It is useless
to say there is no yellow fever here, ti
and we must not think about it that n
we are not going to have it, and all i
- that. The surest way toovercome an 0
enemy is to be prepared to meet him. Il
As a preventive we should not in- cl
dulge too much in cold bathing, as a
that is apt to check perspiration and fi
drive in the heat. The sponge bathl ti
is all sufficient. We must try to
avoid being caught out in the rain c:
and allowing our clothes to getwet n
for the samie reason.
We should live regularly, take rea- f
sonable exercise, not go too mluch in tl
the sun, and do nothing to overheat tl
thie blood. With these precautions b
- we may escape it altogether. But if 0
it shonid come, we must meet it coor- i
agenusly, adhere strictly to the fol- t
lowing directions, and, with the help t
of God, we will overcome it in every
"finstance.
SYMPTOMS. fI
Chilly sensations, pains In the S
bones, headache, pains in the back C
and knee-joiuts, sometimoes sickness C
of the stomach and vomiting. When a
the fever shows itself, the skin be- R
comes dry and hot, the pulse quick
and full, thie face red and flushed;'
tihe eyeballs become red and painful. t
If not attended to immediately, the
fever goes to the brain and the pa
tient becomes delirious. t
TREATMENT.
Whenever any of the above symp
tomns are apparent let the patient be
undressed and put in bed between
blankets. Give a simple dose of
medicine, either castor oil or a bottle e
- of citrate of magnesia. The latter is t
to mote agreeable to take and more
he cooling to the blood. Get a foot bath
that will hold at least a bucket of
, water, fill it: two thirds full of hot
Swater, put into it nearly a copful of
mustard. Put the foot tab on the
bed under thIe blankets, let the feet
of the patient remain in this bath
Sfully half an hour, keeping the blan
kets well tucked in around the pa
Y tient, keep the hands under the cov
l er, let the blankets be well tucked in
te, around the neck. If the head aehee
ia very badly apply a coled cloth to the
St. faoehead. When the foot tabis witp
e drawn do not stop to wipe the feet,
- but cover up as closely as possible so
'as to produce perspiration. Let the
foot bath be repeated while the pains
emtain in the bones.
The room need not be kept too
D close, on the contrary, it is better to
ed have fresh air for the patient to
breathe. But do not let the draft
come on the patient, so as to cheek
Slthe perspiration, which must be kept
lf up while the fever laste. Thie pa
to tient most atot be allowed to get dut
e11 of bed, aiinp or change his clothie,
or take asy;kind offod . His 4ril
mast be small quantities of cle te,
lee lemonade, or orange leaf tea.Th5i
latter is an excellenta sdorihie lee
crashed ih~lttowel ean be given in
Smush ua i-ths is very eQoling
to the stomach. By all mean3 keep
the patient perfectly quiet and free
from all kinds of excitement--he
must no be allowed to become de
pressed. The nurse must be intelli
gent, cheerful and not talkative.
There should be no one allowed in
the room but the nurse, and shel
should never, if possible, he absent
from the bedside, even for a 'moment.
If there is no relapse the fever is apt
to leave the patient in 72 houts, but
lshould it'continue longer there is no
occasion for alarm, for daring the
whole of the epidemic of '67 1 have
known the fever to last four or five
days'without abating and the patients
recovered. Great 'are must be taken
to keep np a gentle perspiration du
ring the continnance of the fever.
As soon as the fever leaves, if the
patient should feel too faint or weak,
let a teasponufull of good brandy or
whisky be given in the same quanti
ty of ice water with a little white
sugar, from time to time. Should
sickness of the ast,mach appear, a
mustard plaster must be applied to
the chest to prevent vomititing. The
feet and legs are apt to he cold ;
these must be rubbed with dry imus
taid, and long woolen stockings put
on.
NOURISHMENT
must be given in very small quanti
ties, and of the very lightest kind
say a couple of tablespoonfuls of bar
ley water, rice or corn meal gruel at
intervals of two hours, or whatever
the stomach ntmy be able to bear du
ring the first day, counting from the
time the fever leaves. The next day
a little chicken broth or beef tea can
be given. Afterwards tea and toast
and a little broiled chicken, or a cou
ple of fresh oyesters if it should be
the season for them.
On no account should the patient
be allowed to eat strong or Indigesti
ble food. as more deaths occur from
this cause and leaving the bed too
soon, than almost any other.
The great trouble is in convincing
the patient that he must lay in bed
for some days after lie thinks lie is
well. Often persons thought them
selves perfectly well and only com
mitted the small imprudence of walk.
ing across the room to look out of the
window, and remaining up but a
short time died in a few hours. Oth
ers feeling themselves entirely recov
º ered, beiing excessively hungry, ate a
hearty meal and died in two or three
hours after. About the tenth day, if
everything has gone on smoothly,
and the patient has had no relapse,
lie can have his clothes changedtand
3 sit up a while. If he should feel weak
lhe must lie down again. The patient
a can drink Scotch ale or good lager
beer during convalescence.

tidsummer Madness. di
Grant for a Third Term-How to Ex. r
tingulsh all Hope of Republican
Success. k
[From Harper's Weekly.] i
There is a sort of frantic despera- is
tion in the tone in which Gen. Grant's si
nomination is urged. The drift of the it
articles is a plain confession that up. ti
on him hangs the only chance of the n,
Republican party; and that the di
chance arises, not from the greater
wisdom of Republican policy, but ti
from the dire extremity of the cono- b
try. A more ridiculous strain cannot ri
he imagined. One of these papers b
says that "the sooner the necessity of
nominating Grant is generally recog
nized, and the event is accepted as a
foregune conclusion," the better for b
the Republican party. Another says
tlhat his call to the Presidency "is a
believed to be essential to the welfare
of the country." Mr. Emory Storrs, b
in the Illinois Convention, advoca- 0l
ting, amid loud cheers, the nomina- a
tiou of Gen. Grant, said:
The laboringman inquires, Shall I
be permitted to labor without inter
ference from mobs or mob violencet
Shall the wages of my labor be se
cre? Is there in this country any
one man whom the nation can place "
at the head of its aflairs who will r
see to it, so far as he is concerned,
that in all these I moay be securet a
All these laboringmen are asking d
themselves this question, and they
have answered it. Property asks this
question. Capiitl of all kinds makes F
the inquiry. Nay, every good citi
zen, each for himself, is reveling in
his mind to say, and has been for º
months past, who is thereof all others e
3 in this country who, placed at its C
Shead, will see that the great essentials 1
of life, liberty, ptiperty, the due ex
ecution of all the laws, shall be pro
l tected and carried out !
All this is is unmistakable. Geno I
f Grant is to be nominated, not, as the t
representative of a policy of admin- ,
istration, bat as a savior of society.
He is not to,carry out measures that
have been argued before the people,
t and which have been approved by
them at the polls, but he is to protect
us against anarchy and impending
disolution of social order. But if he
be the one man indispensable to our
continued peaceful national and so- .
cial esistence, we must keep him in i
e the position of savior as long as
Heaven graciously spares him. We
t, cannot afford to take the risk of the I
0 dissolution of society at thdiend of
e four years, we are not in any danger I
s of such dissolution, and his nomina
tion is aQt necessary.
0 The reasons urged for the nomina
0 tion of Gee. Grant are typified in a
picture of a man on horseback with
standing a host of anarchists.* Those
k who do not think that this is the situ- I
alien, who do pot believe that the
American Government is on the edge
it of chaos, and who, thesefore, are not
, desirous of samuoniOiog a dictator
Stlppase who are not yet tired of (It
~ popalar institutions, and who kili
. that a tation is the atmosphere of
Sliertorll oppose the
olesito *soolmy.-We doi
fia th ascet
º supposing that hli has authorized this pl
nonsense, or that it is especially bh
agieeable to him. He has always tr
shown hiinself to be an office loyal to sli
the laws, and this presentation of hil til
as the imn perial hope of America is so
exceedingly conical. There is, how- th
ever, a serious side to it, and we beg Ih
these heady Republicans to temeim- lci
her this: that the chief and vital ^b- mn
jection to the Republican party in the Im
minds of made most patriotic and in- de
ielligent citizens is the conviction that ol
it has conlle to regard itself as the th
country and the rightful Government. pa
and to consider opposition to itself as
treason, if not a wrong offered to hu- as
man nature, and that consequoently it ex
holds all means of perpetuating its co
power to be permissible if not imper- sic
ative. This conviction is immense- of
ly strengthened by the ground taken hr
by Republicans for the nomination th
of Gen. Grant. That ground is that th
he alone can save Il9 from destrue-i pu
taon. Every honest, honorable, and ot
patriotic American rejects wit!i scorn at
such an assumption. We have la 'gh
ed at Demnociats who argue that Gen. is
Grant has the ambition of Louis Na- co
poleon, and enjoys royal dinners he- di
cause he wishes to be a king. But ac
here is a Republican paper which kt
says of his nomination: "We have tl
reached a point where a firm, steady th
hand is needed to guide the nation."
That is the tone of Louis Napoleon's mi
toadies. The duty of an American of
President is to execute the laws, not in
to guide the nation firmly. Those as
who vociferously, and upon such va
grounds, demand the nomination of co
Gen. Grant, are doing their utmost to pr
extinguish all hope of Republican en
snccess. sit

Below we give the financial planks
of the several Democratic state con
ventions which have been held thus
far in 1878:
Indiana financial planks:
That national bank notes shall be G4
retired, and in lieu thereot shall be
issued by the goverument an equal so
Samount of treasury notes with full
legal tender quality.
That we are in favor of making the
United States notes, coammooly called F
greenbacks, a full legal tendrer in wt
payment of all debts, public and pri-. i
vate, except such obligations as are
by the terms of the original con- ta
tracts' under which they were issued, j"
expressly payable in coin.
That we are in favor of the imme
diate and unconditional repeal of the pt
resamption act.
Illinois Democratic financial planks: if
That we are in favor of the imme- te
diate and unconditional repeal of the se
resumption act.
That we applaud the action of con- wi
gress in the enactment of what is hi
known as the silver bill, and accept
it as a partial measure of financial re- m
lief; but we demand such further leg
islation as may result in authorizing ch
silver bullion certificates and legaliz.
3 ing the coinage of the silver dollar,
the demonetization of which se de-o.
nounce as an act meriting the con- he
demnation of the people.
That is is in the exclusive preroga
t tive of the United States to issue all
bhills to circulate as money, and a
t right which ought no to be exercised di
Sby any state or corporation.
vThat no fortlher contraction of the km
vwlume of legal tender treasury notes
Souglt to be allowed, and they should c
r be received for customs, taxes and
public does as well as private debts, oi
Sand reisuned as fast as received.
That the national bank notes should
be retired, and instead thereof there a
should be issued by the government
an equal amount of tieasury notes.
Ohio Democratic financial plank :
We demand as furtlher acts of justice
as well as measures of relief, the ab- a
solute repeal of the resumption act, ft
,and the liberation of the coin hoarded Ii
in the treasury ; the removal of all ai
I estrietions to the coinage of silver, ec
and the re establishment of silver as t
Sa money metal the same as gold -the
same as it ' as before its fraudulent
Sdemonetization; the gradual substi
tution of United States legal tender
paper for national bantk notes, and
t permetanent establishment as the o
Sthe sole paper money of the country b
made receivable for all dues to gov
r ernmeit, and of equal tender with
Scoin, thie amount of such issues to be 4
Is , regulated by legislation or irganic o
law as to give the people an assur- a
ance of the stability in volume of cur- t
rency and consequent stability of
value; no further increase in thet
bonded debt and no further sale of
o bonds for the purchase of coino for
Sresomption purposes, but the gradual
V* extinction of the public debt; rigid f
economy and the reduction of expen
e, ditures in all branches of the public z
' service, and tariff for revenue only. i
Iowa Democratic fianeial plank: C

It The Louisiana Paellle Bonds.
S[N, O. Times.] N
d From what we can hear of the purport ,
e of the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of the Louisiana PacifiBe Railway
bonds, it is simply that "the lower court
did not err in refusing the mandamus etl
asked by the company.' The compny,
e it will be remembered, prepared a form a
ic of bond which the Governor objected to p
r- and on that ground refused to sign tj
r- the State bonds to be delivered to the
Df Company. The latter thereupeas applied
le to Judge BRodgers for a mandamus to
of compe lthe Goverger to sign and issue
the bonds. The judge decided that the
r form of the bonds was a matter within
I the discretion of the Goveroor ad re
id fused the mandamus. The Supreme
I- Court esustaihed this decf6i' It' does C
ic not appear that the merits of the case
were gone into further than to decide
that the courts can not control the dis
cretion of the Governor in asuch cases.
r This is probably sound law as the suit
