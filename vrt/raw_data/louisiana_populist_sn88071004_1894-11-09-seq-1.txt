HeProposes a Military Despotism.
W\ashin,.ton. 1). ('.. Oct., 11.
Mlaj. Gen. Sclhotiehl has made to
the secretary of war his relport on
the operat ions of the army during
the last year. (ien. .tchotiehl, who
has been at the head of the army
since the death of (ien. Sheridan.
announces his retirement next
year. The report is principally
devoted to the dliscussion of the
necessity for strengthening the
milihtary arm of the government to
colpe ' ith internal dlisordler as well
as lpo..sible danger from without,
particular reference being md(le to
the l)ebs .,trike. The rep,)rt says:
l)urin, a large ipart of the year
the army has been employed in the
supplression of domiestic violence,
which took the form in mane cases
of forcible resistance to the exe
cution of the laws of the United
States, seizure or destruetion of
property under the care of U'nited
States otfic.rs and open defiance
of national authority. These dis
orders, at first -local in their char
acter, spread at length to about
one-half in number and two-thirds
in area of all the states and terri
tories, exchluding Alaska. So
wide-spread and formidable an in
surrection eal'~d for the vigorous
action dictaied by the president.
At the city of Chicago resistauce
to law assumed such formidable
proportions that it was necessary
to concentrate at that place nearly
all the army forces that could be
mnade available from all parts of
country, while on the Pacific coast
the navy department placed at the
disposal of the department com
mander the naval and marine
forces at the Mare island navy-yard
and those forces rendered valuable
services. responsible duties thus
devolved upon the army depart
ment commanders were performed
by them and the troops under their
command in the most satisfactory
manner. The insurrection was
promptly suppressed without any
unnecessary sacrifice of life in any
case.
The prompt and vigorous action
of the troops in all cases and the
great forbearance manifested by
them when subjected to all sorts of
insults and indignities designed to
provoke retaliation were worthy of
the very highest commendation.
They illustrated in a striking man
ner the great value ,to a govern
ment of a well disciplined force
at all times subject to orders of
that government for the enforce
ment of faithful execution of its
laws.
sTATE TROOPS NOT sUFrrFICENT.
It would seem unnecessary to
point out the fact that any force
like the militia of the state or the
police of a city action primarily
under another authority, though
highly efficient in their appropriate
service, cannot be made a reliable
instrument for the prompt and ef
fective execution of the laws of
the United States. Manifestly,
everygovernment should have an
adequalte force of its own for the
execution of its own laws, no less
- the jadicial and exective
,4tuer neeasary for the amie put
Ths osryu is a ow for the firet
time squarely confroated with the
necessity of making adequate pro
viion, not only for d'efense against
day podlb foreign sgrresion,
bW also for defasme against domes
tic viol~ace in the form of forcil'b
telibbs to the l::wa of e eini
tidaha A just stimat of
sevas of defase requirsa
askmlon of tb  st extent of
United St"ltes and the great amount
of prols'rty widely disp:red
. throughout this territory. either
lbelonging to thle lUnited States or
in such condition as to ie under
the protectioi of the national gov
ernlment. W\\hen these facts are
duly considered it he.,Oimes l:lni
fest that the present strength of
the army is not adequlate to the
performance of tihe service which
iay at any timer he required. It
is certailyv manifest that the pre
sent condition of the counti v,
with a populAtion of near 701,4_1)0,
o00. unlder the danger of disorder
now known to exist cannot he mllet
by the s::ume force that wa.s dlcenel
1'h.1quate t venly-five year: a.io,
when the popul'tion of the coun
try '.va. less than half its present
amount. ant d(oumstic violence was
not a:,),plhendued. One man to
fourteen square miles of territory,
or one man to 2,)I00 of population,
is surely a cry smuall guard to
p)rotect property and prevent vio
lation of law, leaving out of con
sideration the forces necessary to
guard( the extended seacoast against
suldden attack by a foreign enemy.
It is also worthy of remark that
Iiore than once in the hlast su,,wn-r
an infuuriated Inmob in a sinhl , c;ty
w u. isvice as formi idt'le in nlun
hers and caplable of doing vastly
greater injury to life and property
as the most formidable combina
tion of Indian warriors that ever
confronted the army in this coun
try. In other words, the, army
has recently been required to destl
with an enemy more numerous and
dangerous than any savage enemy
which it has heretofore been called
upon to meet.
ARMY SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED.
The effective strength of o'lr
army should be considlerahly in
creased. .This can be done at a
very small comparative incre'ase in
cost. The present rerinental or
ganizations need not he largely in
cr,'seld. Two additional regiments
of artillery for i he necessary sea
coast defense, two additional iegi
ments of car:d-ry to patrol the
long lines of reilroad!s under gov
ernment pl o: ction, and the pre
sent twenLy-tive regiments of in
fantry, conve'tedl into three batta
lion organizations, would, it is be
lieved, be a just conservative esti
mate of what is now setually
needed. For this the existing
number of commissioned officers
is nearly sufficient. But a consid
able permanent increase it the en
listed strength of the army should
be made, and a still further in
crease authorized to be made by
the president when in ins judg
ment an emergency requiring it
may reasonably be foreseen.
It is not a good military system
in which the executive has no au
thority whatever to increase the
etfective strength of the army in
time of need, but must await the
slow process of legislation for that
purpose.
Wise forethought, in apparent
anticipation of such conditions as
those which have confronted the
government during the last year,
dictated several years ago the es
tablishment, under authority of
congress, of large military posts
uear the great business and rail
way centers of the country.
Several of these large posts are
now in condition to be occupied by
troops, while others are in process
of construction, and a few others
are still demanded, for which it is
presumed congress will in due time
make the nee~ssary appropriations.
But in respect to the military ne
cessities which may possibly arise
oatof conSict with foreign pow
era, it has for many years seemed
impoueile to impress unpon tbhe
pseopl of the United States in
geneial the view entertained by all
tlioughful military students. This
impossibility appears to have re
sulted very I:r'.ely from the na
ti():r.I .elf-esteem which grew out
of the results of a great domestic
conflict tln'rou~h! which the cunttry
passel in the period of IS61l to
1.t;3. Tl'ie ccndition of the pullic
mind since that time1, has Ieen that
or onfiidentt invincibili v :rainst
any possible foreign attack. Hlow
ever humiliating it may h,,, to tihis
confident self-esteemn it is neverthe
less a simple duty to point to the
great military lesson which is now
being taught to the worldl.
-----~c-..-- -. - - . .
Blessings of Tariff.
The following is an extract fronm
a Washington letter to the South
ern Mercury, and you should read
it anl I,.arn h:ºw the tariff bill
throws great chunks of pIrosperity
into the back yards of the people:
I notice hy glancing over this
tariff or revenue lamw that acorns
are almitted free. This will help
out the farmers of Texas. The
price of acorns wilt certainly come
down so that every family in the
country can have acorns three
times a day, including Sunday.
It will also be noticed that ashes
are admitted free. Now this is
glad tidings for every family
where the children have been cry
ing for ashes.
A very necessary article in every
family are bladders. Bladders are
relieved from taxation. Every
one can get all the blaulders re
quired now without paying any
duty on them. This will enable
the farmers to harvest all the wind
necessary to last them throughout
the year at a very small outlay.
Democratic politicians should make
a note of this.
Dried blood is also added to the
free list. If anyo ne wants foreign
blood to put in his veins he can get
it now at a nominal cost.
Bones are also free. There is no
tariff on bones. Any person or
persons who uses bones, and they
are a necessity in every family,
can get them free of duty.
Musk is also free. Every farm
er in Texas can keep himself per
fumed with musk with very little
expense hereafter.
Nux vomica is also on the free
list. This enables the people to
throw up what they do not wish to
retain on their stomachs at a very
limited cost.
Opium is also free. Our Chinese
residents can hit the pipe .now,
and any one who desires can form
"the habit" and not be required to
pay the government for the privi
lege.
Diamonds and pearls are also on
the free list. These two articles
were admitteed free for the special
benefit of the farmers. The "hay
seeds" can procure diamonds for
their shirt fronts now without pay
ing a tariff tax. No doubt but
that the farmers of Texas will take
advantage of this to lay in a sup
ply of diamond and pearls.
Bird eggs are also free. What
a blessing this will prove to the
laboring man and farmer. The
farmer with a mortgage on his
land can now procure a "eettin" of
foreign bird eggs at rates that wdl
justify him in engaging in the pro
fitable business of producing birds.
Furs are also free. No longer
need the farmer's wife go through
the winter without a sealskin
cloak. Only just think of Nancy
Jane taking an airing in the jolt
wagon over to the kog meeting
house, tricked out in a sealskin
cloak. Oh, myl
Jo sticks are also free of duty
inthis bill. Thi will enable the
Chinese to get all the imported joss
sticks they need.a
IOOld junk is cler of duty. This:
country has Ieen sulfering for old
junk for a lo,,t timnt.
Salt is free. S:lt has heen so
cheap any way that nro one was so
Ioor as to kick a:lout the price of
salt, but lEglisahaIt ipro lucers
wanted it free, so it i, provid ed
for. This cuts the aliar;" of our
lalorer- down to that of pauplner
salt workers of England. as salt is
brought he,'e as ballast, an I, there
fore, free of transportati,, .
Turtles are admitted free.
Everybody can have turtle soup
from this date free of tax. .\A the
most of the farmers and laboring
men are in the soup Iy legislative
enactments, this, will enable them
to get into turtle soup.
Wool is on the free list. This
will cut down the price of wool
:t id further reduce the profits of
farmers andl iwkraisers.
Snails are placed on the free list.
Taxing snails has he,:n a burden on
the people for years. The 1)emo
cratic oncre:;s comes to tle front
and displays its love for the masses
by giving them frt'c snails. This
justifies the enldorsement of the
whole party.
Leeches conle in free. A,\ we
have a well assorted supply of
Iteeches already, native and manor
to the born, we can't say much in
favor of leeches.
Fish bait is also on the fr... list.
This was (lone as a special compli
ment to Grover. luo h:ts hben fish
ing- with ordinary American bait
long enough. Hie demanl is im
portcsl bait. American asit is un
sound. Grover must have English
gold standard bait; hence fish bait
goes free.
The few articles given above as
being admitted to this country free
of duty are sufficient to show that
the late congress was devoted to
the io;erest of the farmer and the
las,.. i peojple.
The teader is reminded that the
poor mans sugar was transferred
to the dutiable list.
This is the bill of which Hon. D.
B. Culberson in his Sulphur
Springs speech said:
I say that our new tariff bill is the
very best bill that has been passed
in forty years. It is better than
the Mills bill, and bettor by long
odds than the McKinley law. It
It has not had a parallel since 1857.
No, colonel, not paralled for
fraud, pretense and humbug.
