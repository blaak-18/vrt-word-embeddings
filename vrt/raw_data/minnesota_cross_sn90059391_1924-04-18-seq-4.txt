OPPOSITION HELPS
GEORGIA KLANSMEN
Pelham Unit Grows Fast With
Political Ring and News
paper Against It
PELHAM. GA.. April 14.—Despite
the opposition of the local political
ring and the editor of the only pa
ver here, or because of such opposi
tion, Pelham Klan No. 153 is the
fastest growing unit in South Geor
gia. This observation is made after
an interview with the Great Titan of
this Province.
It is the opinion of local Klansmen
that if instead of opposing the move
ment, the mayor and other “oppo
sites*' had joined it, it would be as
dead as a door nail, so far as its pur
poses are concerned, for in that it
would hav© ©rabracod what it is de
signed to destroy.
It is the intention of I elham to
have more delegates to the Klonverse
than any other Klan in a town of the
si*e of Pelham.
HUD BIG MEETING
National Lecturer Wins Many to
Klankraft Near DeLand,
Florida
DELAND, FLA.. April 14.—Mayor
J. P. Mace and City Commissioners
Jake Kaserman and T. R. Mood of
Lake Helen, a thriving city near
here, made possible an unusually suc
cessful Klan meeting held by the
Klansmen of DeLand and vicinity
under the leadership of Exhlted Cy
clops Roy L. Cook.
Several days prior to the meeting
invitations were sent to leading citi
zens of this city and vicinity and.
under circumstances vastly different
from those surrounding the DeLan I
meeting last month, Klansman Cook
welcomed the hundred and moic
guests, calling upon J. OUie Ld
munds, student leader of John a.
Stetson University, to open the
meeting with prayer. Following one
stanza of “Onward, Christian Sold
iers,” the program of Klancraft was
forcefully presented by George A.
Brown, author, minister and national
lecturer.
Frequently punctuated by vocifer
ous applause Mr. Brown’s address car
ried the modern crusader’s message,
•nd following a stirring appeal for an
increased membership, the majortt>
of his enthusiastic hearers became
candidates for membership in the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
