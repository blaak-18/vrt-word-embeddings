that position till next morning, when
•they were ordered to re-eriforce Mc-
Laws and Early near Fredericksburg.
That afternoon they assisted in the
assualt on Sedgwick near the Dowl
ing House, drove him, and stimulated
his crossing to the north bank of the
Rappahannock at Banks’ ford. The
division went into bivouac for the
night west of the plank road resting
till the afternoon of Tuesday, when
it again took the plank road for
Chancellorsville. When in three miles
of it, the hardest rain storm I have
even seen, forced us to go into camp
about 5 p. m. Resuming our march
on Wednesday morning, we marched
to Chancellorsville, passed it on the
road to United States ford. On reach
ing the white house, we found the
Federal works abandoned, a disabled
caison in the road was our spoil; a
scouting party sent to the river found
that Hooker and his army had crossed
over, and the Chancellorsville cam
paign was at an end.
In the foregoing sketch, while as
concise as possible, it is necessary to
account for the position of Wright’s
brigade and to show the impossibili
ty of its presence in the position
where Mr. Davis assigns it. As to
, the mishap to Jackson, which was a
calamity to the South, and embar
rassed the campaign; until Mr. Davis’
statement, I thought there was no di
verse opinion as to who did the firing
on Gen. Jackson, or as to about the
hour when he was wounded. Whether
right or wrong, the evidence is that
Lane’s brigade were the troops who
- fired; this is attested by both Confed
erate and Federal authorities, and is
in accordance, with the statements of
other commands of Jackson’s corps on
Sunday morning, with whom we ming
led and heard for the first time of his
wounding, when we met and lined up
on the plank road, near the Chancel
lorsville house, when the circum
stances were fresh in the minds of
all. Both authorities —Confederate
and Federal —agree that the volley,
followed by the rapid artillery fire
about 8:30, was caused by an attempt
of A. P. Hill’s division to capture
some artillery, posted by Gen. Pleas
anton to hold the hill, which had
been denuded of its infantry equip
ment. It was doubtless after this fire
plan to occupy the position at the
white house, sallied forth on a blind
died down that Jackson, with his
mind aflame and stimulated by his
road leading off from the left of the
plank road to reconnoiter before or
dering his troops forward. Having
formulated his plan, he turned to go
back to his lines, when he ran into
the skirmish line of the 18th North
Carolina —Lane’s brigade—who, un
der Jackson’s own orders, were to
fire, without challenge, upon any
force coming from the front. Before
the fire could be controlled, it had ex
tended possibly beyond this brigade,
and was finally added to by the ene
my who, not comprehending its cause,
opened fire from both infantry and ar
tillery. It was perhaps this latter
fire which disabled A. P. Hill, on the
plank road. This fire, from my rec
ollection, could not have been earlier
than 9:30 p. m., and after continuing
for fifteen or twenty minutes, quieted
down for the night. Whether Lane’s
brigade, or some other, began the
fusilade, they should in no way be
held blamable for its results, as
throughout that entire campaign the
orders to all skirmishers and pickets
were to fire at everything coming
from the front without challenge.
This fact is known to every man
who took an active part in these op
erations. Jackson was a stickler for
the ethics of obedience, and had he
got safely through the lines without
a volley, the hapless officer in charge
would have received a prompt invita
tion to headquarters to appear at
Jackson’s matinee.

MOTHER-LOVE.
By L. E. Ramsey.
(For The Weekly Jeffersonian.)
When God by his word created the
earth
And the glittering worlds to shine
above,
The first tender feeling which in
Eden had birth
Was abiding and enduring mother
love.
My children may wander away and
and forget
The many sweet things learned at
Mother’s knee,
But my blessings and prayers will fol
low them yet,
Though they no longer cherish me.
My form is bowed by the weight of
years;
With grief and regret I am almost
wild,
My eyes grown dim by age and tears,
And my heart is aching for love
the while.
For my children’s love, oh, God, I
pray!
Roll back the scroll of darksome
years
And bring to me again one glad,
sweet day,
Ere life had known such torturing
cares.
To my empty arms bring my baby
girls,
Let me see once more each dear,
sweet face,
While each loving arm around me
curls,
To clasp dear mamma in a tender
embrace.
To this distant past memory often
glides
And rests on a long ago treasured
toy,
On a lovely doll, Lady Alice’s pride,
Or a dear little lamb, Baby Emma’s
joy.
Ah, those were sweet and happy
years!
Because I had then my children’s
love,
And taught them oft, with hopes and
fears,
The love of God, their true Friend
above.
I shall crave their love,* till life be
spent,
For them blessings entreat from
love’s great fount,
For the love of a mother, God-like
and God-sent, ,

HOW “JOHHY GOT SOME
BLANKETS.
The following incident was recent
ly related by a Federal:
4 ‘Once we were camped in the
mountains East Tennessee. I
didn’t know it could be so cold down
South till I tried it for myself. One
bitter night I was on picket duty
away off from camp, down in the
edge of some woods and close beside
a little creek. I was tramping along
through the .snow, kicking my feet
and beating my hands together try
ing to keep warm, when I heard a
voice somewhere off on the other side
of the creek calling softly: ‘Yank!
Yank!’
“I knew the enemy was in camp
not far away, so I raised my gun in
an instant; but the voice called
again: ‘Don’t shoot, Yank! I’m all
alone, and I don’t mean any harm.’
“ ‘Who are you, then, and what
do you want?’ I asked as quietly as
I could.
“ ‘l’m a Johnny,’ said the voice
again, ‘and I want to see if you can’t
spare me a blanket.’
“ ‘You are crazy,’ said I. ‘l’d be
shot if they caught me giving you
a blanket.’
“ ‘There’s no need for you to get
shot,’ said Johnny, ‘and I’m ’bout to
freeze, picketing out here in the
snow. My uniform’s nothing but
rags, and; I haven’t got any overcoat
or blanket or anything. Blankets are
scarce over in our camp, and it’s
awful cold, Yank.’
“He said it solemnly in that soft
voice of his (the Southerners have a
soft, easy way of talking), and —
well, the upshot of it was that I
promised him I would bring a blanket
with me when I came back the next
night and leave it to him to get it.
Next night when I went to saddle up
(our picket line was so far from
camp that we had to ride) I got half
a dozen blankets out of the commis
sary and put them under my saddle,
and was just about to get away with
them when the sergeant spied me.
‘Hello, there!’ said he. ‘What you
going to do with all those blankets?’
“My heart was in my mouth; but
I knew he couldn’t see how many I
really did have, and so I answered
back cool enough: ‘You don’t sup
pose it’s warm out there picketing a
night like this, do you?’ And with
that he turned away. I tell you I
was glad to see his back!
“Well, I got safe out to the woods
with my blankets, and pretty soon I
heard the same voice calling again:
‘Yank, Yank, have you got that
blanket?’
“ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I have six of
them, and I came near getting caught,
too. ’
“ ‘Glory!’ said Johnny. ‘Glory!
Now you jest slip down to the creek
and unfold them a little and drop
them in one at a time, and I’ll do
the rest.’
“I did just as he told me (I didn’t
have to get off my beat to do it), and
he went a little way down the creek
and fished the blankets out ,as the
current brought them ©long. When
he’d got the last one out, he fell
down on his knees (I could see him
in the dim moonlight), and I never
heard anybody pray such a prayer as
that Southern soldier prayed for me,
kneeling there in the snow in his ag
ged old unifom. I took took off my
hat and stood still till he was through,
and then he faded away in the dark
ness. ’ ’
(Let us quit talking about “time
healing the wounds” or the bitter
spirit of true soldiers. The foregoing
illustrates the kindly regard that ex
isted while the soldiers on both sides
were suffering each for his principles.

LOVE’S LAWS.
By Carolyn Wells.
Be sure you’re right, then lose your
head.
A ring on the hand is worth two at
the door.
A fool and his money are soon
married.
A little debutante is a dangerous
thing.
Proposals make cowards of us all.
There’s no fool like a bold fool.
The longest way round is the sweet
est way home.
One good kiss deserves another.
’Tis love that makes the man come
’round.
Kisses speak louder than words.
He loves best whose love lasts.
People who live in glass houses
shouldn’t hold hands.
Where there’s a will, there’s a
wedding. Hampton’s Broadway

MILK PAINT.
Stir into a gallon of milk about
three pounds of portland cement and
add sufficient Venetian red paint
powder to impart a good color. Any
other colored paint powder may
as well be used. The milk will hold
the paint in suspension, but the
cement, being heavy, will sink to the
bottom, so that it becomes necessary
to keep the mixture well stirred with
a paddle. Mix only enough at a time
for the day’s use. Six hours after
painting, this paint will be as im
movable and unaffected by weather
as a month-old paint. The addition
of carbolic acid or some other disin
fectant makes it very suitable for
dairy work, as it then has a cleansing
effect. As a paint for barns, farm
fences, gates, etc., it is unsurpassed.

Do not overlook the necessity of
varying the ration of the work horse.
There are farmers who feed their
horses 10 to 12 ears of corn three
times a day, together with prairie
hay and pasturage, and the horse
seems to do fairly well, but the horse
requires a balanced ration as does
the man himself, or the dairy cow.
Unless the horse gets liberal pasture
he will not obtain sufficient muscle
and bone producing feed. The horse
should have some bran, oats and
alfalfa hay. These are the common
feeds of the farm from which the
horse can be supplied with bone and
muscle. These will also add palata
bility, which is a thing worthy of
consideration. —Farmers ’ Advocate.
