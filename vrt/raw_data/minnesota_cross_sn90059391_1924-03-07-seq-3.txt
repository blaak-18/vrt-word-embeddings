ATLANTA KLAN UP
FOR CONTEMPT OF
COURT DECISIONS
Bolshevism Has Been Fos
tered by Nathan Bedford

Ei'Gxalted Cyclops Was Seeking
Organization's Support for
Sheriff
ATLANTA, GA., March I.—H. J.
Norton, ex-Exalted Cyclops of old
Nathan Bedford Forrest Klan No. 1.
and other officers and members who
have been instrumental in fomenting
internal strife since July, 1923, have
been cited for contempt of court,
and will be tried March 8. The alle
gations upon which the contempt or
der is based charge the defendants
with willful violation of decrees of
the court.
The serving of copies of the pro
ceedings in contempt, issued by
Judge George L. Ball, of Fulton su
perior court, at the instance of the
national organization and a state
ment tantamount to an admission by
the defendants of the wrongful use
of the Klan’s name, and the public
declaration by them of their inten
tion to desist from further violations
of the law, serve to break the last
thread that held the insurgents to
gether in the conspiracy to wreck
the organization, and sounded the
death knell of local opposition to the
Klan which began when E. Y. Clarke’s
contract was cancelled by Imperial
Wizard Evans in January, 1923.
The allegations of the petition are
based upon the actions of the ex
efficers of the old Klan which dated
back to July, 1923, when the Grand
Dragon of Georgia suspended the
charter of Nathan Bedford Forrest
Klan No. 1 for their failure and re
fusal to make an accounting.
After the hundred day period had
elapsed, the Grand Dragon revoked
the charter of the Klan, for non-pay
ment of dues and for failure to turn
over to the Imperial Palace funds in
their hands belonging to the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan. Inc.
H. J. Norton, Exalted Cyclops, et
al, obtained a temporary injunction
restraining the Grand Dragon from
revoking their charter. An order
was issued by the court restraining
the Grand Dragon from revoking the
charter until a hearing on the peti
tion could be had; and at the same
time an order was served on the of
ficers and members of No. 1 enjoining
them from functioning as a Klan ex
cept for the purpose of accepting

FLORIDA DEBATE WON
BY KLAN DEFENDERS
Question Discussed at John JL
Stetson University, at
Deland
DELAND, FLA., March 1.-—ln a
brilliant presentation of the sublime
ideals of Klankraft, Miss Zita C. Bel
lamy and J. E. Edmunds Successfully
upheld the negative of the question,
“Resolved, That the Ku Klux Klan
Should be Abolished,” in an open fo
rum debate, held recently at John B.
Stetson University, DeLand.
Demonstrating the necessity for the
Klan in American life, Miss Bellamy
vividly portrayed the part it has
played in preserving American ideals,
and won enthusiastic applause by her
forceful presentation of the case for
the Klan. The historical background
of the Klan gave Mr. Edmunds an op
portunity to establish the Klan in
its true relationship to American
progress and development.
The arguments for the affirmative
were presented by Donald Faulkner
and Wilhelmina Bates. The faculty

dues, which were to be held in trust
for the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
This last was for the purpose of
serving members who wished to keep
in good standing with the national
organization, and who were innocent
parties.
Notwithstanding the several court
orders, it is alleged in the petition,
the officers and members continued
to “naturalize,” disburse moneys,
adopt resolutions, accept Klectokens,
recieve and expend money taken in
at dues, and give out publicity in the
name of the Knights of theKu Klux
Klan, while, at the same time prose
cuting a campaign of villificat ion
against the national organization and
its officers, using the “trust money”
for that purpose.
Althougn Norton in a newspaper
interview a few days ago stated that
“we now disclaim any allegiance or
connection with the Ku Klux Klan,
and will so plead in the suit which
that organization has filed against
us.” it is a fact that until Monday of
this week he was a candidate for
sheriff of Fulton county and held
himself out as a Klansman and was
making a bid for support on that
ground. He has since come down,
probably on the advice of his attor
neys because of the complications
that would surely arise should he con
tinue to hold himself out to the pub
lic as a Klansman and enter a plea
of “not guilty” to the contempt pro
ceedings.
The statement given out by the ex-
Exalted Cyclops, upon being served
with the citatioh for contempt, does
not gibe with many affidavits of per
sons who have paid money to the de
fendants, thinking they were affiliat
ing with the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan.
Strong Klan Unit is
Built at Unadilla, Ga.
UNADILLA, GA., March 1. —Unadil-
la, Dooly county, Georgia, is probab
ly as free from the influences that
menace America as is any other com
munity in the nation. Yet, Unadil
la has a Klan, which, based on popu
lation, is the equal of any Klan in
the nation. Haring enrolled the
flower of the community’s manhood
under the banner, “Non Silba sed
Anthar,” and realizing that its work
to be effective and a help to the na
tional organization would of neces
sity have to be in the spirit of the
motto, Dooly County Klan No. 192,
has adopted as ts guidng light a mot
to of its own, “We Are Our Brothers’
Keeper.”
As expressed by the Exalted Cy
clops in a lecture to the Klan this
week, it is intended to keep ever be
fore the members the fact that just
because they have nothing local to
engage their attention, is no reason
that they should lose heart or cease
to put forth their best efforts toward
helping keep the unit at Unadilla
compact.
Dooly County Klan No. 192, Realm
of Georgia, wishes Klansmen in more
unfortunate positions to know of the
little that it is trying to do, so far
away from the battle line, to help
those who are actually in the fight,
and by unselfish devotion to a cause
are lending aid and comfort to their
brothers “out there.”

How the Klan Came to
Telegraph Operator in
Lonely Wayside Office
GRAFTON, W. VA„ March I.
He is a telegraph operator for
the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad
Company’, and he lives at a small
flag stop not far from here. Men
in his trade are hard to find and
he very seldom gets away from
the little box-like house he calls
his office. Day in and day out
he sees the race of men go by”
when the fast, limited passenger
trains whirl by his little shack.
They never stop there, and the
only recognition he gets from the
whirling cargo of humanity is a
shrill toot of the engine whistle.
In his little office he sits by a
table on which is a row of tiny
instruments which pound a
steady cadence through the long,
wintry days. But from this con
fusion of dots, dashes and spaces
he reads the events of the world
before they are chronicled in the
newspapers. Every day he hears
some news story relative to the
Ku Klux Klan. One day he asked
some men, who were working on
A Nation’s Life
(The Boston Transcript)
In his statement on Thursday about
th ( ‘ immigration policy of the Unit
ed States, Representative Albert
Johnson touched on what is the key
of the whole matter. We quote his
reported words as a concise expres
sion of his and many other Ameri
cai,s’ opinion on a subject that unhap-
P»v has been too often obscured by
what are really personal considera
tions rather than national:
“The public, however, should under
stand that if congress can be co
erced by threats from those repre
sentatives of aliens to lay aside the
pending restrictive bill, so that their
followers may swarm into the coun
try, the time will soon come when
the people of the United States will
have lost all control of their own af
fairs.”
In these words, Congressman John
son removes the discussion from a
piano where one racial group is de
clared better than another, where
prejudice takes the place of reason
ing, and resentment is bred, to the
plane of the interests of the whole
nation as the great western democ
racy. Though he may have had no
such intention, he does more, for no
one who looks at this problem in its
present state can fail to see that here
is involved the standing of the Unit
ed States among the powers. Of
these, all that are old and well es
tablished have proved to their own
satisfaction that a reasoned nation
alism is a practical necessity in self
government. By theorists and by
those who love generalities, this may
be called a selfish policy, but it has
e *P***fefl*® for a backer. The result
of this ia that foreign governments
take it as fundamental that the com-
Eosition of their own citizenry shall
8 a matter purely under their own
control. The rule is one of their
standards of national self-respect and
it is a standard which automatically
they must apply to the United States.
Now then what, shall the Old World
governments and foreign offices in
fer if they see an essential domestic
6 olicy affected and dragooned in the
nited States by what are racial
groups? Should such a thing become
a reality it would be a bold man who
would say that it left American di
plomacy and American influence as
strong for good as before. We do not
8ay fl ***** this has taken place, and
confidently pray that it may not take
place, but if, as Congressman John
son intimates, foreign blocs in Amer
ica should succeed in dictating an es
sential domestic policy, the world
would witness a political tragedy, it
would behold a great nation not maa
tor of ita .>wn affairs, its own destiny,
ita own honor. The more calmly and

a freight train that had stopped
for orders, “what about this
lodge called the Ku Klux Klan?”
He was assured that it was a good
movement. And, from that time
on, Klansmen who were working
on the freight trains threw off
Klan papers and literature when
they passed the little station.
That was several months ago.
Recently this telegraph operator,
whose name is withheld in com
pliance with Klan policy, wrote to
a minister friend of his in this
city, and asked if he, the minis
ter, knew where he could join
the Klan. Of course, the minis
ter was a Klansman and told him
to get in touch with the state
department of extension at
Clarksburg.
Recently the telegraph operat
or wrote the local department of
extension, offering any man a
day’s wages, his transportation
to and from the little flag stop
and initiate him into the great
lodge that is taking the country
by storm.
the more judicially this question is
considered, the more Americans can
see the real and only issue, whether
the "massy (told” of the (treat prom

Progress of
the Churches
Christian opposition to child la
bor in the cotton mills and silk fac
tories of China is proving effective.
A Chinese Christian mill owner re
cently led in a movement among the
cotton mill owners of Shanghai to
discontinue, completly, all labor by
children under 12 years of age. The
National Christian conference of Chi
na previously had set up a proposed
labor standard for these establish
ments, and it is now announced that
this standard has been accepted by
the Chambers of Commerce at Pe
king.
Church interest in Canada still cen
ters about the proposed union of the
Presbyterian, Methodist and Congre
gational denominations. Opposition
is heard, chiefly from a small group
of Presbyterians. Bills which are
soon to come before the Federal Par
liament at Ottawa and the legisla
tures of the various provinces will
bring the question to an issue. Mean
while. it is interesting to note that
the Manitoba legislature, Feb. 14,
passed the second reading of the
Church Union bill with practically
no opposition. The feeling through
out the country is that this action is
indicative of what will happen gener
ally when the measures come up be
fore parliament and the legislatures
The final union, if this is an accurate
forecast, will probably come within
a year.
It is encouraging to note that the
authorities responsible for the Brit
ish Empire Exhibition at Wembley
Park. London, during the next sum
mer “have decided that the exhibition
shall not be open to the public on
Sundays, except for special services to
be held in the stadium, such as the
Empire Sunday Service.”
Madras, India University, a mission
ary institution, has a student senate
which exercises a certain control over
the affairs of the school. It was
something of an innovation, even in

such an office, Mrs. Radhabhai Sub
brayan was elected to membership in

FAILS TO TAKE PLACE In Duck Creek Valley
Knights of Flaming Circle Do
Not Molest Klansmen as
Threatened
CLARKSBURG, W. VA.. Feb. 26.
Flying reports ranging from sensa
tional telephone calls warning of an
attack on the Ku Klux Klan by the
Knights of the Flaming Circle, to
rumors of recurrent outbreaks by
John Siers. former city detective who
recently declared war on the Klan
while in a drunken rage, have been
pouring into-Klan headquarters here
for the past ten days.
While sensations, including an at
tempted jail delivery, have been com
in gthick and fast since Siers, a re
puted officer of an anti-Klan move
ment, started his attacks on the Klan,
the crowning excitement came late
Thursday afternoon when a report
was broadcast that the Knights of
the Flaming Circle were planning to
attack the Ku Klux Klan when the
great American organization went in
to meeting Thursday night.
Although feeling was running high
a nda general spirit of unrest was
prevalent throughout the city. Thurs
day night wa sone of the quietest in
*he town’s history. Klan guards were
placed about the Klavern. and detach- 1
ments of men also pat rolled the
streets. Thousands of men attended
the Klan meeting. There was not a
trace of uprising, men of the Klan
guard said.
The Moral Obligation
of Citizenship
It is not to be wondered at that
human nature, always perverse, re
gards every law, self-imposed or
otherwise, as having been enacted
only to be broken. Opposition to law
is engendered and excused on the
ground of what is supposed to be
self-interest. Evasion of the law is
regarded by the transgressor as offer
ing a possible opportunity to gain a
selfish advantaage, or to be privi
ledged to do something which, for
the good of all, is forbidden to all.
Were not this human tendency domi
nant and aggressive, there would be
no need to enact laws forbidding the
doing of certin things and providing
penalties for their violation.
It may be insisted that, in the
manner of so-called human laws, one
person has as much right to ignore
or violate a statutory injunction as
another, or a number of others, has
to impose it. But this postulate can
hardly be maintained by reasonable
argument. First of all, it is con
ceded, especially under every demo
cratic form of government, that the
deliberate judgment of the majority
properly proclaimed or enunciated,
governs all. The minority can re
verse that judgment or authority
only as it becomes the majority. This
transition is quiickly made whenever
it is apparent that right is on the
side of the few, rather than on that
of the many. Wonderful advance
steps in civilization have been made
by just such processes.
A second and more convincing test
of authority can, however, be help
fully applied. Gradually there has
come to the peoples of each succeed
ing generation some additional light,
perhaps in the form of revelation,
possibly through education, and un
deniably through experience, which
has made clearer the way of true
progress. Now it requires no stretch
of the imagination to be prepared
for the conviction that, in this ad
vanced day of human thought and
really purposeful accomplishment
along other than purely materialistic
lines, there mav be. behind and sup-
porting even human or man-ma ae '
laws, something higher and more
powerful than the mere will of the
majority as that will is expressed in
numbers and physical power. Man
kind certainly is advancing toward ;
a better understanding of its rela
tionship, not only to its Creator, but i
to itself. Some progress is being 1
made. Thus considered, what once »
might have been regarded as a mere !
interdict, a blunty phrased “thou ]
shalt not,” becomes the inspired and *
logically sound pronouncement, the -
clearly defined policy of a people
pronerly and wisely self-governed.
There is no appeal from such final
and enlightened judgment. Nullifi
cation of laws thus enacted is im
possible by the processes commonly
employed, simply because evil ignor
ance, and selfishness are powerless
against enlightenment, unselfishness,
and right understanding. Law which
is more than a mere ukase or a mere “
arbitrary interdict becomes at once
established, because it represents, or
reflects, in any critical analysis,
something higher than mere human
will.—The Christian Science Monitor.

securely among the
picturesque hills of upper Harri
son county Is Duck Creek a peace
ful, Utopian valley where quiet, God
fearing folks have lived 100 years un
disturbed by peace officers.
When one visits Duck Creek and
stands atop one of the majestic emi
, nt-nces which surround the placid lit
tle valley, he sees a long stretch of
country road, by which flows a creek
|°f elear. spa'kling water. Here and
there one would observe an occasion
al farmhouse and in the distance a
typical country church. In summer
lit is not uncommon to see great
droves of sheep lazily grazing on the
adjacent hillsides. Everything every
where speaks of peace.
The lit tin creek which flows plac
idly down the valley and from which
the ideal community derived its
name, reflects peace as truly as it
mirrors the azure skies. And, why
shouldn’t it? A law suit never exist
ed between, any of the citizens of
Duck ( reek; no citizen has ever been
arrested and a peace officer of anv
kind has never been in demand here
since the community was settled more
than 100 years ago by Charles Hor

as you would have them do anto you."
is the slogan of Duck Creek folk, and
and is the keynote of their harmoni
ous existence. Duck Creek folks, not
unlike all good Klansmen. believe in
the tenets of the Christian religion,
which means that they have accepted
Christ as theii criterion.
On the first and third Sundays of
each month, the Rev. C. D. Thorpe,
pastor of the Methodist Protestant
I church. Lost Creek, comes to Duck
Creek and holds religious services in
the quaint little church. It .is a
white, wooden structure, sans the ad
vertising boards that adorn the outer
walls of city churches. There is no
pipe organ or uniformed choir. Not
even a piano has been installed in
the place of worship. The congrega
tion does the singing, while an hon
est, God-fearing woman operates an
old-time organ. Among the songs
they sing is,“The Church in the Wild
wood,” “I Love to Tell the Story”
and scores of similar songs that have
furnished the inspiration to a truly
religious community.
Here these honest farmer folk gath
er twice a month and praise God for
His goodness and hear over and over
again the beautiful story of Jesus
and His love. It is in this little
church that the minister brings be
fore them the age-old law of “Do un
to others as you would have them do
unto you.”

[ there have been wars and rumors ot
wars, including the Civil. Spanish
| American and World wars. Duck
Creek has been represented in them
all. Even in the Civil war, when th«
nation was divided against itself.
Duck Creek citizens practiced the
I Golden Rule and survived the w»r
without any great misunderstandings.
Duck Creek is three and one-hall
miles from Lost Creek. Its popula
tion is small. than 200 persona
reside in the valley. It is not on the
map. However, it is given up to be
an ideal community.
Sounds like Sir Thomas More’a
Utopia the imaginary isle of exqui
site perfection doesn’t it? Or, per
haps some wil! think it a valley is
the land of n ake-believe where only
those of the cinema world dwelL
However, it is a real place and is in
habited by real people.
Among Duck Creek’s population
there are s< m* who are Klansmen,
and a few who are not. There is na
record where citizens of Duck Creek
huve ever been in court, but there am
records to show that there are Klana
men residing in the Utopia—yet som«
men of prominence insist that the
Ku Klux Klan is an outlaw organiza
tion.
Who would believe that those quL
et, honest living farmer folk of Duck
Creek are outlaws?
The eastern press and eastern au
thors have pictured native West Vir
ginians as feudists, two-gun men and
criminals in general. “Tol’able De
vid” and “The Fool,” two big time
plays, picture native West Virginia!*
as criminals and a race of poorly
clad, half-starved people.
Duck Creek is an example. Every
person residing in that community,
with the possible exception of twe
families, are native West Virginians,
This community is only about one
and one-half hours’ ride from Clarke
burg. West Virginia.
While not all West Virginians are
free from the stigma of having been
under arrest, the vast majority are
a fairly well informed, cultured, lavr
abiding people.
While 60 per cent of the native
West Virginians have united with the
Ku Klux Klan and a thorough inves
tigation has been made of their char
acter, the Klan press is endeavoring
to give the outside world a few true
sidelights on the real character of
these so-called “mountaineer feud
ists.”
No person whose integrity is ques
tioned can be admitted to the Ka
Klux Klan. Many things have beea
laid at the door of the great Ameri
can organization that the order was
not responsible for. The same is
true of West Virginians. If feuds d«
exist here, they are the result of the
driftwood and scum of other states
that seeped in here during the flood
of prosperity.
To a Klansman, the argument that
West Virginians are lawless and un
educated, is preposterous. If they
were, they could not have been ad
mitted to the great American or
ganization.
