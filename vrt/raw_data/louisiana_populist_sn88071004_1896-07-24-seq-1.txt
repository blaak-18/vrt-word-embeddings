Seconld-Weailtlh 1elonw.s to hiili
who creates it, and every dollar
taken fromi industry without an
equivalient is robbery. "If any will
not work, neither shall lie eat."
The interests of rural and ,ivie
l:ahor are the same; their interests
are identical.
Third---We delieve that the time
has come when the railroad corpo
raltions will either own the people
or the people must own the rail
'roads, anld should the goverlnmont
enter upon the work of owing or
managing any or 11 og the rail
roads, we should favor an .niend
nent to the cunstit ution by which
all persons engagad in thai govern
mlent service shall lie plaeed under
a civil service regulation of the
most rigid character, so as to
prevent the increase of the powIer
of the national amnii.istration by
the use of snch additional govern

eccond'-Transportation being a
Iae:las of exchange and public ne
e.(sty the governmnent should own

The telegraph and the telephone,
like the post office system, being a
necessity for the transmission ot

Third-The lands, including all
the resoures of wealth is the heri

be prohibited. And lauds now
Iheld by railroads and other corpo
rations in excess of their actual
nleedls and all lands now owued by
dien asbould be reclaimed by the
government for actual purposes
