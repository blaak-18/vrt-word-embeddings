Mr. Winm. Cantine, of New Iberia,
representing Holiday Wind Mill
Co., Batavia Illinois, is putting up
forIMr. Jean Vigneaux, in the rear
of that gentleman's premises, a steel
gem wind mill. The reservoir will
be 20 feet high and have a capacity
of x760 gallons. T is well has been
bored, and will a~ply supply the
water needed. This wind mill works
automatically. that is, when a certain
amount of water is pumped up, at
that stage, automatically it throws
off the gearing and will pump up no
more water, consequently keeping
all the time the same amount of
water in the reservoir. Mr. Vi
gneaux will use the water for his
stable, sprinkling, fire protection,
and household purposes.
