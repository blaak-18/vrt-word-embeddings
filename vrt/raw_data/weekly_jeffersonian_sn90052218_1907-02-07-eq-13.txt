FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN
LEAVE THE MILLS.
The second section of the child la
bor bill which was passed last sum
mer, went into effect Jan. 1, and it
is estimated that at least five thou
sand children, now working, who are
under the age of 12, will be remov
ed from the factories and other plac
es where children are employed in
Georgia.
The first section, which took all
children from work who were under
the age of 10 years, went into effect
when the bill was approved by the
governor.
The third section, which stops chil
dren working who are under the age
of 14, will go into the first of
next year. This section prohibits a
child under 14 years from working
between the hours of 7 p. m. and 6
a. m. *
Section 4 goes into effect the first
of next year, and it prohibits chil
dren under 14 years of age from
working unless such child can write
his or her name and simple sentences,
and shall have attended school for
twelve weeks of the preceding year.
Other sections made provisions for
the carrying of the law into effect
and for punishing those who violate
it. ’
Frees 5,000 Children.
“Section 2. Be it further enacted,
by the authority aforesaid, That on
and after January 1, 1907, no child
under 12 years of age shall be so
employed, or allowed to labor, un
less such child be an orphan and has
no other means of support, or unless
a widowed mother or an aged or dis
abled father is dependent upon the
labor of such child, in whicn event,
before putting such child at such la
bor, such father shall produce and
file in the office of such factory or
manufacturing establishment, a cer
tificate from the ordinary of the
county in which such factory or man
ufacturing establishment is located,
certifying under his seal of office to
the facts required to be shown as
herein prescribed; provided, that no
ordinary shall issue any such certifi
cate except upon strict proof in
writing and under oath, clearly show
ing the necessary facts; and provid
ed, further, that no such certifi
cate shall be granted for longer than
one year, nor accepted of any em
ployer after one year from the date
of such certificate.”
To the Hon. Madison Bell, repre
sentative in the legislature from Ful
ton county, is due the praise for the
passage of the child labor bill in
Georgia.
A special hearing was granted on
about July 25, 1906. Amendment af
ter amendment was offered, some
with the purpose, as the authors avow
ed on the floor of the house, to kill
the bill, and others for other reasons
offered which the authors thought
would benefit the original Bell bill.
The author, however, of the original
bill fought each and every amend
ment, some upon one ground and
others upon others; but the main ob
jection was to the effect that twenty
three of the senators, which num
ber was constitutional majority of
that body, had agreed and were hon
or-bound to support the measure
just as it stood, and that any altera
tion, the dotting of an i or the cross
ing of at, might reverse one vote
which would cause the bill to be lost,
Each and every amendment was de
feated, and the bill went to the sen
ate just as the author had original
ly offered it. It received, practically
a unanimous vote, which was 125
to 2, the fight of its enemies having
been lost by the defeat of their amend
ments, and they gave up hope.
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
The bill was signed by the govern
or on August 1, the birthday of the
author.

Don’t let the speculative fever that
is rampant over this country now on
account of the unusual industrial ac
tivity get you into the speculative
swirl. It is a mighty thin line be
tween the speculator and the gambler
and there isn’t any line between the
gambler and any other sort of a
thief.

Lightning flashes in a storm are
found, by an English observer to be
uh cn less irregular in period than they
appear. Such storms have usually
two ioci—sometimes three —irom
w inch the flashes radiate, and the dis
charges irom eacn come at regular in
tervals. Tiie apparent irregularity is
aue to the varying rates of the diner
ent centers. In a storm of July,
tne two foci were about a mile and
a half apart, and in an hour the
northern center emitted thirty flashes
at intervals of 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90
seconds, and the southern center gave
sixteen flashes at intervals of 17, 31
and 51 seconds. Another unexplaineu
observation is that just before each
great flash there is a momentary faint
iignting up of the sky in the storm
region.

Near the Lucrine Lake, to the north
of beautiful Baiae, Italy, where the
villas of Romans of imperial times
crowded each other to the water’s
edge, and where, in consequence, to
this day the ground is full of archaeolo
gical treasures, a very fine mosaic has
just been discovered, says “The Chi
cago News.” In form it is a parallelo
gram, measuring about five and a half
yards by nearly ten yards. The piece
represents a hunting scene in which
there are many wild beasts and several
hunters, the favorite subject for large
mosaics in those days. It has been
bought for $1,500 by the Ministry of
Public Works for the decoration of the
great monument to Victor Einmanuel,
in Rome, which is slowly taking form
and will eventually dominate all old
Rome.

When the care-taker at a traveling
menagerie recently exhibiting at
Stratford, England, went to heat the
water In a tank under the cage of a
boa constrictor one morning the rep
tile was missing. After two hours’
search they found it snugly resting
in a cinematograph box. Attempts
to induce it to return to its proper
quarters were resented, but the crea
ture responded readily to the woman
snake charmer, its keeper. During its
wanderings the big reptile swallowed
a cat.
