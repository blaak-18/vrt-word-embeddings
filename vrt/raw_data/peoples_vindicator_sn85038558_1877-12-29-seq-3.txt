[Marksville Bulletin.]
There are a few patriots in New
Orleans who argue that a Constitu
tional Convention would he disinte
grating in its effects on the party.
There is no telling the depth of the
1 anxiety of these people for the pub
lic safety. We will give them credit
for sincerity, and assure them that
the better thinking portion of the
community do not altogether share
their anxiety. They believe that a
e party that has solemnly pledged it
Y self to reform, and fails, is not to be
a trusted again, and we agree with
.- them. But we respectfully submit,
. if there is anything disintegrating in
this, it will not come from the hold
ing of the Convention, but from a
t failure to hold one. We assure those
'r persons, when the people say reform
Df they mean it, even though it may in
i- volvoe a certain amount of decapita
t tion, and the reduction of a few over
gi own salaries. We feel sorry for
these people but cannot give up the
ry Convention.
TIIE nearer we approach tie equa
tor the more frequent do we find ab
normal affections of the liver; but for
a remedy controlling such in any cli
mate the HoME SToxMACU BITTERS
