THE POPULIST PAPER THAT “RODE
THE STORM.”
The Missouri World, published weekly at
Chillicothe, Mo., is a straight Populist paper
and always has been; it is the only Populist
paper that rode the storm which swept out of
existence the many hundred of reform papers
that were published in 1896; it is not a local
paper, publishes no local news, but each week
gives the telegraphic news and markets; is as
good for one state as another and circulates
in all the states. Three-fourths of the dele
gates to the recent Populist national- conven
tion were subscribers to the Missouri World,
some of them having been subscribers ever
since the paper was established over nineteen
years ago by Dixon & Lankford, who are still
its editors and publishers. The World has
been a supporter of Mr. Watson ever since
he was in Congress, wanted him nominated
for President in 1596 and helped nominate him
in 1904 and this year. Its subscription price
is 50 cents a year (52 copies). Send stamps,
cash, order, draft, or your check. Unregistered
letter at publishers’ risk.
