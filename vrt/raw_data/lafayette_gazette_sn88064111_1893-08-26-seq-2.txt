THE OUTLOOK.
There has been a slight change for
e best in the financial situation,
the week closed with a marked
h, pefulness on the part of business
:mien and financiers, at the great
rmoney centres, who have most
elosely watched the prevailing con-.
ditions. The importation of gold
Is increasing, large amounts of new
currency are being taken out of the
i banks and gradually finding its way
in trade channels, and there is an
increasing probability that Congress
will give the country wise legislation
and on the whole there are several
-indications that the turn of the tide
I has been reached. The striking
feature of the week before was the
dearth of currency, but there is
every indication, and a fervent
hope, that those who have been
boarding currency will be disap
point'ed. On the whole, as we said,
the outlook is an improved one,
though the actual situation is at
present still decidedly gloomy.
EXPERT WORK.
" In the hurry and lateness in get
ting our last issue, we were com
pelled to leave out many of the de
tails of the capture and subsequent
identification of the negroes arrested
and charged with the atrocious at
tempt to murder and robbery of the
railroad station at Iowa, some 75
miles east of here.
It may be recalled that Mrs.
Cantrell came in with Sheriff Reid
of Calcasieu, and John Long, the
railroad detective, and the lady
positively recognized King, the ne
gro, as one of the party who com
mitted the dastardly act.
This crime was committed at 9
o'clock p. m., and Sheriff Ike Brous
sard received the information from
Calcasieu's sheriff while in bed, a
few hours later, and the plans of
this vigilant officer were soon formed.
There was a freight train due here
at z o'clock a. m., and it was the
caboose from the same train that
took Mr. Cantrell to Welsh for
medical aid, and it was not thought
possible that the culprits would
have the hardihood to board that
train. Ike thought they would,
and they did, riding between the I
cars. Ike, ever on the alert, with 3
the assistance of some of the rail
road boys, soon had everything in
" readiness when the train should ar
rive, and when it did arrive the two
negroes walked into the net and were
safely caged. Let us say here that f
the sheriff performed a skillful I
piece of detective work, and one V
that would do credit to any profes
sional detective in the country.
The two negroes are in jail in Cal- t
casieu parish, a living warning to c
every Inalefactor to give Lafayette g
a wide berth, for if they don't the c
sheriff will get him every time. a
But the part deserving special men
tion lies in the fact that Sheriff t]
Broussard had secured sufficient
evidence to convict, even if the
lady had not recognized her assail
Iant. Ike can wear a big plume in
Bis hat; it is a right that no one can
dispute. s
PUBLIC ROADS.
ScoTT, LA., Aug. 1893.
To the Editor of The Lafayette Gazette:
The road between Lafayette and this
place is in a very bad condition. I noticed 1
three bridges, especially one on the north of
Adelma Martin; this bridge is at least two r
above the grading with a mud hole at
·tad. The other two are between
Bireaux and D. Boudreaux-thisis Fc
line sight, with holes on both sides
Sbridge in the middle, and yet this road 0
is worked under contract of $S5o per mile,
part pay in advance. This is a shame for
our Police Jury to permit such.
HUMBUGGER.
The Gazette has received a half ri
:dozen complaints in regard to the o0
bad condition of the public roads. fa
-These complaints came from Scott, r
Carencro, Royville and Breaux
]Bridge. The Scott and Royville a
ntoads particularly, are reported to al
Be in nearly an impassable condi
tion. "
* From "*Humbugger's" letter it h
can be seen that the road spoken of a
h under the charge f the road con
tractor. ol
I fo
- RUiLDIItf A CITY.
B this-tiame we are fully cogniz-p
of the truisma that booming a
thing, advertising it is ni
thing. R
Sboom it is necessary to
e # special atttaction and
S wind, which can,
04 ~rethe -w!d. A'-ir
A? *·
,Mr. Leslie, it may be recalled, furnt
ished ILfyette--some months ago
y---tlue attracti o in the form oft
proptsition, that, coupled with what
Kind Ntature hau done for this high
ON ly favored country, and the "boom"
began to grow. In Mr. Leslie's
d proposition every man who favored
it began congratuling himself on the
glorious prospect before the city.
- Coincidently appeared a coadventu
rer---a professional boomer-a cross
between the "greatest show on
earth" and a political barbecue. But
it is a waste of time and space to go
ss into details-they are known. Well,
at we have experienced the sequel fol
st lowing the "boom" and we are now
- reaping the whirlwind of reaction
that resulted.
But it served one good purpose.
e It has tended to make us rely more
y upon ourselves. Consequently when
na fleeting chance that promised to
ss connect us with a sister town passed
n by,with others we grasped at it with
al the eagerness of a drowning man for
le a straw. But, we are pained to say,
it begins to dawn upon The Gazette
that what appeared as a rainbow
is full of promise is but an " irredes
it cent dream" and in this we are sup
n ported by the trend of-events. From
a source that we have no reason to
question, it has been stated that the
Southern Pacific officials will in no
at wise interfere with the plans of Mr.
Knapp and his associates, and one
of those plans, it is declared, is to
have two outlets, one at Carencro
t- and the other at St. Martinsville;
i- therefore assuming our information
to be correct, and as we said, we
it have no4 ason to doubt its correct
d ness, Lafayette and New Iberia
t- might as well pucker up their lips
e and whistle,insofar as those contem
5 plated railroads are concerned.
Now, we know it is totally bey
o. nd the power of the people them
j selves to build this road, and even
e admitting that the railroad compa
r ny would be willing to extend help,
- conditions are such that years must
- elapse before work thereon could be
undertaken ; hence, considering
; these facts, would it not be far bet
- ter to let go and concentrate our
i efforts on an enterprise that we can
L land inside of twelve months, one
f that will put thousands of dollars
more in circulution in our city? The
Gazette's faith in the ultimate erec
tion of a refinery near town has nev
t er wavered. It has been, lately, in
r tensified from conversations heard, 1
t and of which we will speak in a fu
I ture issue.
Some Fine Canes.
Mr. R. C. Landry, favored The
Gazette with a sugar cane having f
x8 red joints,weighing 3 pounds and t
13 ounces and measuring 6 feet and i
9 inches. Mr. Landry has forty
acres, which, we understand, will r
be sold to Mr. M. Billaud. t
An other cane came from the
field of Mr. Babtiste Dupuis and I
had z5 joints, was 8 feet long and v
weighed 5 pounds and Ix ounces.
It is clearly evident that Lafa
yette soil is adapted to the cultiva
tion of the sugar cane and with fa- h
cilities for its manufacture into su
gar, in a few years it would be the c
crop of the parish, and inasmuch s
as it is the best paying of all crops 1
our farmers would be enriched to
the extent of its cultivation. v

The convent school will reopen
Monday September 4. The Sisters
have also under their tutelage and r
guidance a school for boys, which
will reopen on September 4. TheI
system of education includes the
English and French languages.
The pay car is nnusually late this e
month, but is expected to-night or
Monday and will gladden the rail
road boys. p

1e A GROWING CRIME.
ir One of the greatest and most fre
d quent crimes with which prosecut
g ing officers have to contend is that
of perjury.. Notwithstanding the
Is severe penalties attached to this
1; crime it really seems to be on the
r increase. Nowadays, whenever a
. nIan commits some offense against
'r the law, if he so desires, he can find
some wretch who, for a mere pit
tt tance, will perjure himself to clear
s his clieut. This is one of the most*
's dangerous classes of criminals, for
is wherever a perjurer is found there
will the lawbreaker go unwhipt of
justice, all efforts of prosecuting
attorneys to the contrary notwith
standing. It seems to be only of
g late years that this crime has be
d come of such frequent occurrence;
g indeed, district attorneys are con
d stantly baulked in making out cases
on account of the brazen perjurer.
s In many cases people are confident
o that a witness has grossly lied to
clear a criminal, yet they have no
v means of proving him as such, and
consequently he is allowed to go on
plying his nefarious business and -
cheating the law out of its legiti
mate prey. The perjurer is a men
- ace to a community. So long as
he is suffered to continue his rascal
e ity, just so long will the law be
- laughed at and derided by every
- criminal who is able to employ the
e dishonest witness in his behalf. So
soon as it has been plainly made
'manifest that a man has perjured
Shimself before the courts, then the
s good people of the country should
rise en masse and drive him from
t the country. This would be only
an act of self-defence,for what man
f is safe when the perjurer stalks
through the land ready to swear to
anything for mnoney.-Ex.
