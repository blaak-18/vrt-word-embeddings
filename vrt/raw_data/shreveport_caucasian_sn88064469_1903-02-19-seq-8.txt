LAW AND ORDER.
Citizens Aroused to Action As
semble in Mass Meeting.
DENOUNCE UNLAWFUL ACTS
Whereby The Lives and The Property
of The people are Threatenet.
A Demand for the Resigatioti of Judge
C. D. Hicks Was Adopted Unani
motisly by Many Citizens.
The citizens of Shreveport were
moved yesterday to the highest degree of
resentment, and it was a resentment aris
ing from the realization of the danger
they had escaped from the unlawful acts
of miscreants which threatened their
property and their lives.
Until Saturday morning few citizens
knew that the initial step to anarchy had
been inaugurated in their city, and when
citizens belated at their offices or their
clubs Friday night related their experi
ence with tangled wires this resentment
was intensified. It was such an outrage
as had never been experienced in the his
tory of this city. One gentleman, an eld
erly friend of the Caucasian, stated that
he reached his hore in the nick of time
and believed that if he had been later
his home would have caught fire from a
wire which had become charged with
deadly electricity. When this outlawry
was made known citizens were called to
the Board of Trade at noon where this
dastardly work was denounced in tin
measured terms. The Board of Trade
room was crowded and from there it
was adjourned to the opera house at 5
p.m. It should be stated that at this
meeting of the Board of Trade there was
introduced a resolution, unanimously
carried, demanding the resignation of
Judge C. D. Hicks, and at the same
meeting there was presented a list of the
names of men who are alleged to have
aided and abetted in this outlawry. The
citikens in a body, numbering a hundred
or. more, headed by Captain Peter You
ree, president of the Commercial Na
tional Bank, followed by leading busi
ness men, marched to the headquarters
ofThet umberiasd Telephone-ompan ,
from the porch of which Captain Youree
read a list of men who were ordered out
of town. It may be said that tie excite
ment increased at every step. Nor did it
allay until late in 'the afternoon.
The meeting at the opera house, with
Peter Youree chairman, was a demon
stration for law and order against dis
order and anarchy. Hon. E. H. Randolph
and Hon. J. H. Shepherd made telling
speeches becoming the occasion. The
president of the Electrical Workers
Union desired to speak and explained
that his men have had no connection
with the outlawry, but when questioned
he admitted that he had no interest in
the Cumberland Telephone Company or
in the city but was interested in the I
union's welfare. He may not have meant
it in the spirit in which he spoke his
words but he left an impression on many
of his hearers which was not favorable.
The nmeeting at the opera house warmed
up to the adoptiohn of a resolution pro
viding for the immediate organization of
"A Law and Order League. and there 1
was distributed a number of badges in
dieating th~e spirit and the purpose for
which they are to be worn. Such is the
gist of what occurred yesterday as a
demonstration by citizens aroused to
action.
But how was the plot to deal destruc
tion discovered?
Fortunately, Mr. Querbes. in his ca
pacity as mayor, was advised through a
mysterious medium of what was design
ed. At first he was incredulous, but he
started on an investigation and when he
reached West Shreevport he was con
fronted with the cowardly, the dastardly
work of destruction. It should be said
that as Axoo as he was advised by the
mysterious medians of this scheme of de
structiork he communicated with Chief
of Police Jones who was ready for ef
festive work in a few minutes, and hay
D.Iluphreys.

ing discovered that a number of guy
wires holding the big heavy poles of the
Cumberland Telephone Company had
been cut and that the telephone would
come in contact with the trolley wires of
the Belt Railway and the wires of the
electric light company, he ordered, as a
.safeguard. the shutting down of the
power at the electric light plant and the
power at the plant of the Shreveport
Traction Company. It was a move which
can he fully appreciated only by those
who can reach the realization of the dan
ger to tiny one of the family who if
called to the telephone for answer or
cotuinfication could have been shocked,
perhaps fatally. And thet think of the
tiles, of the death of innocent people
from contact with telephone wires rest
ig on or hanging fronm trolley wires
charged with deadly electricity.
To Mayor Querhes and his nysteriotts
adviser all credit is due: due to the
mayor for his prompt action, his dili
gence and his vigilance: due to the mys
terious man who realized what threaten
ed and who while unwilling to divulge
his name would not permit the destruc
tion of property, the danger threatening
the lives of innocent mien and women
and children. 0
Is this mysteriaus adviser a lineman?
Is he a union man? If lie knew did oth
ers know, *ud if others knew why did
they not do as he did? Or why did they
not raise their hands against a crime the
contemplation of possible results so dire
as to make one's flesh crawl for the
thinking over it.
And yet only one nan was caught. red
handed, at this diabolical, this dastardly
work of destruction, and that man is J.
Huckles. He was arrested by Officer
George Hull and a bill of information
has been filed against him for cutting
wires to the poles of the Cumberland
Telephone Sompany. Huckles is an elec
trical worker who, while a Union man,
has, it has been alleged, no connection
with the local Union. Will the local Un
ion denounce his act? Will the local
Union assist in his prosecution, in their
own vindication as law-abiding citizens?
Will the local Union repudiate this act
of anarchy?
The fight between the linemen and the
Cumberland Telephone Company is no
concern of the Caucasian. We believe
that all men should strive to better
their conditions within reasonable
bounds. In the contentions between the
strikers and the Cumberland we have
had little to say and have left to the
legal -authorities --the-settlenent-of-per
sonal disputes and fights, but when a
crisis such as confronts the good law- 1
abiding citizens is reached there is then
but one course to follow, and that is the
course suggested to every honest man,
Law and Order. Before this violent
demonstrations public sentiment was
with the strikers, but this kindly feeling
has been reversed by one of fear and
apprehension..
Unionism is not outlawry. It is not
anarchy. Union measures have won in
lawful pursuits of legitimate ends. Un
ions which will not *stand for law and 1
order must be repudiated. That at least I
is one of the cardinal principles which
have given power and influence to the
leader Mitchell in his fight against the
coal barons. It Unionism will not de- I
nounce outlawry it should perish as it is
not entitled to or is worthy of the sup- 1
port of men who favor law and order
over outlawry and anarchy. Peace. law
and order must and shall prevail. The I
loyal, the lawfur citizens of Shreveport.
