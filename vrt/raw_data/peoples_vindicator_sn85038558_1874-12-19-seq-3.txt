A Christmas Invitation.
Christmas is drawing near, that
Feast of joy and happiness; already
the heart of a Christian community
exults at the thought of the consoling
NscCes which enliven the domestic
fireside, obscuring tneath the veil of
•a temporary oblivion the crosses and
cares of every day life.
But in the midst of our enjoyments,
and while surrounded by a home
circle of health and happiness, let us
not be deaf to the voice of that
gusidiani spirit, which ever whispers
is our ear and endeavors to touch the
tender cerds'of our hearts with the
words-"remember the poor."
Oh! how can we enjoy, with a peace
ful conscience, the blessings of our
Heavenly Father, when we know that
so many of lls Jsuffering members
are destitute of every earthly comfort,
a:lling on us for relief, while we hesi
tate to proffer even the limited aid,
which our Creator wishes us to ex
te:dl to our fellow-creatures; and
which lie looks upon, and rewards as
done to Himself.
We have no excuse now to say, "we
.do not know who is in need." The
undermeutioned accounts, show plain
er than words, that we have only to
send our gifts to the good Sisters of
Mercy, and rest assured that it will
be disposed of according to our
wishes.
Some may say-"money is so scarce,
I have inone to send," but the Sisters
will thankfully accept any gift in be
half of the poor.
We can send to their convent, (in
stead of umoney)sopme food or cloth
ing, to be distributed by them, to our
destitute bretriren;j we will thereby
briug joy and happiness to many a
desolate hearth,;and draw down the
blessings of heaven on ourselves and
families for the coming year.
Let usjaot wait until the eve of the
great Festival to depositomur mite in
the Sistea's hands, if so, they cap
hardly accomplish the 'serk of dis
tribution in time, for the poor people
to have a Merry Christmas over it, as
the Sisters have to dispose of our con
tributions according to the number of
applicants.

Fighting at Vicksburg,
PARTICULARS BY MAIL.
The Vicksburg Herald, of the 8th
inst., contains the following particu
lars of the first day's fighting at and
around Vicksburg :
About 3 o'clock yesterday morning
an ilarm wassounded from the court
house, and may citizens hastened to
that place, but as there being
NO IMEEDhATE DANGER,
retired to their homes.
About 5 o'clock the alarm was again
Lounuded, and the citizen sohliery
again gathered in small numltlers.
About 9o'clock, however, the court
house fire bells rang out a general
larm, arnd from mouth to iiiuth-
from one to another--all over the
city, went the intelligence that the
negroes in armed bodies were advan
cing on the city from several direc
trons. Immediately in every street,
from almost every house, armed men
hurried to thl court-house, and in half
an hour a company of aboat one khun
dred men, under command of Col.
Horace Miller, marched out Grove
street and
MET TIIE NEGROES.
inside of the city limits, at a bridge
near Point Lookout, under commaind
of Andrew Owens. Col. Millet or
dered a halt, and himself rode for
ward and advised the negroes to dis
perse. lie warned thelm that they
were violating the law, and unless
they dispersed to their homes the con
sequences might be severe. Oweens
replied that he was there, with his
followers, in response to orders from
Crosby, and would only disperse at
Crosby's orders, Owens was then
permitted to visit Crosby, who was
under guard at the Court-house, and
returned to his men with orders from
Crosby to retire to their homes. This
they apparently consented to do, but
as the whites were retiring to their
command, the negroes defiantly an
nounced that they had come t.here for
a fight, and were going to have it.
FIRING THEN COMMENCED
on both sides, the negroes fleeing af
ter the first few rounds, followed up
by the citizens with a desultory fire.
Six or seven negroes were killed in
this skirmish, about as many wound
ed, and fifteen or twenty. taken pris
oners. This body of "invaders" hav
ing been dispersed, Col. Miller's com
mand returned to the court-house.
A little past ten o'clock a heavy
body of armed negroes was reported
on the Jackson read, near the Pem
berton monument, and a detachment
of the citizen soldiery was dispatched
thither, and there
THE MOST SANGUINARY ENGAGEMENT
of the day occurred. The negroes
were encountered, strongly entrench
ed at the. old Federal breastwork,
just under the brow of the hill im
moediately this side of the Pemberton
monument. Thie citizens opened a
skirmish ire upon them, which was
kept up for more than half an hour,
without any effect on either side.
While this skirmish was going on,
Capt. John Hogan, with several white
men from the neighborhood of Sny
der'a Bluff, eun route for the city, catme
up on the opposite side of the hill,
and were flied upon from an ambush.
ir. Oliver Brown, a son-in-law of ,·r.
Snyder, was lshot through the head,
and almost instantly killed.
Capt. Hogan's coolpany and the
citizens then made a terrific charge
ufon the negroes, who took refuge in
a cane-brake, after a short and bloody
fight. About twenty-five of the poor
dupesaad wretches were killed and
wounded here. After their first vol
ley upon Capt. Hogan's company they
fired widly, and though their loss was
heavy, no other casualty was report
ed on the sides of the whites.
AboLut the same time that the troops
were sent out the Jackson road, an
other detachment of two companies
was sent
OUT CHERRY sTREET -
to meet a body of negroes approach
nlug from that direction. The negroes
were found in cansiderable force just
south of the city ; and while one com
pany advanced in front, the other
made a detour to the right, and a
third company (*hich had gone out
the Yazoo Valcity), came up on the
left flank, and with a yell tire three
companies cbairged, the negroes, after
a few" shot,, scampering as fast as
their legs could carry them. They
were followed by the cavalry for some
distance, and utterly routed.
Numerous bodies of negroes were
dispersed on other roads by the car
airy, and by half past 11 o'elock
escouts reported the negroes routed
from all their position. A piece of
artillery was out, but its big mouthed
talk was not required to convince the
negroes that it was a bad day to cap
tare acity.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and ,has ever borne a
widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinenment
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
$ religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself. and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
lug Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and Ileas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of.Tux
OLDEST AND THI E BEST of Family Story
Papers.

AIIT DEPAI1'1TMEN 'r, 1874.
Th'lce illustrIattos or the ALorNIE have
wso a worhl-wide rentation, andl in the
art canltres of Euro'pe it is an adlitted fact
that its wood e'uts are examnpcles of the
highest 1,erlfcticio ever attained. The
conlolln prejudlice in tlvor of 'steel plates'
is rapidly yielliug to a more edueatedl and
discrimniinating taste which reeognizes the
advanitages atid' superior artistic quality
with greater tfaility of plrodiuction. The
woode-cuts (rf the AtI.InmtE lssess all the
delie'aey and elaborate tilish of the most
costly steel plate, while they afl ford a Ib0t
ter rcalelering of the artist's original.
To fully realize the the woerftil work
which the Aldine is doing for the cause of
art culture ill America. it is only Inees
sary to consider the cost to the people of
any other decent representatioits of the
prod1tlutious of great painters.
1In addition to designs by the members
of the National Ae;midnly amnd other lnoted
American artists, the Aldinu, will repro
duce examples of the best foreign lan:sterl,
selected with a view to tithe highest ,ertis.
tie success and greatest general interest.
Thus the subscriber to the Alline will, at
a trilling coset, enjoy in his own home the
pleasures and refining influences of true
art.
The quarterly tinted plates for 1874 will
be by Thos. Moran and J. D. Woodward.
The Christmas issue for 1874 will con'
tain special designs appropriate to the
season, by our best artists, and will sur
pa s in attraetiuusany of its Ipra!ecessors
Presaiumas for 1874.
Every subscriber to the Aldiue for 1874
will receive a pair of chromos. The orig
inal pictures were painted iil oil for the
publishers of the Ahline, by .Tholmeas Mo
rlan, whose great Colorado picture was
parehased by Congress for ten thousand
dollars. The subjects were chosen to rep
resent ' The East" and "The West." One
is a view of the White Mountains, New
H-Iampshire; the "other gives the cliffs of
treen River, Wyoming Territory. The
difference in the nature of the scenes
themselves is a pleasing contrast. and af
fords a good display of the artist's scope
and coloring. The chromos are each work
ed from thirty distinct plates, and are in
size (12 iy 16i) and appearatnce exact fac
similes of the originals. The presentation
of a. worthy example, of A mnerica's greatest
landscape painter to the subscribers of the
Aldine was a bold but peculiarly happy
idea, aunt its successftll realization is at
testedl by the fIllywing testimonial, over
tire siguature of Mr. Moran himself:
Newark, N. J;, Sept- 20, 1873.
Messrs. James Sutton & Co.,
Gentlemen--I am delighted with the
prooffs in color of your chronmos. They are
wonderfully snecessfuil representations by
miechauical prlocess of the original pain
julas. Very Respectfully,
TnoMAs MORAN.
These chromnos are in every sentlse Amer.
iean. They are Iy an original American
process, with materials of Anleriean man
ufacttlurec, ponl designs of Aeulrican scene
ry by an Xmlcacnieu painter, and presented
to stubscribers to the first sunccessfi'l Art
Jolurnal. If no better bicallsi of all this
they will certaitly possess an interest no
foreign production can inspire, and neither
are they any the worse if by reason of pw
eliar facilities of prodnetimon they cost
the puplishers only a trifle, while EQUAL
