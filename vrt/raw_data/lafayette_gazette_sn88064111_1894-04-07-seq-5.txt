Raymond Breaux, an employe of

few. hoursin Lafayette last Thurs
. day and called on The Gazette. He
went to Rayne to take part in the
primnalis  theti heat Saturday.,
Mr. J. D. Thorna son, of Cincin
tili, Ark., and a representative of
the B. W. telbourn Novelty Com
pany, of Littleton, N. H., .has been
in Lafayette in the interest of that
firm. Although new in this business,
"Mr. Thomason is a very successful
canvasser.
the attention of the people o
L Lafayette is called to the folloWikg
item taken from the Breaux Btitlge
Valley. "The rads from here to
Lafayette are I~ such bad condition
that tht planters of this section who
use to deal in Lafayette for plowing
machineries, etc., are compelled
now to go to our sister town St.
Martinville. Lafayette should do
something to remedy this, or she
will lose all her trade from this sec
tion."
Our esteemed brother of the Star
still maintains the superiof ity of
Abbeville 'vert !in Hook, In
comjiliance with an urgent request
from a delegation of prominent Pin
Hookians, headed by the mayor, The
Oatette will let the matter drop.
These gentlemen claim that the
present controversy is proving in
jurious to the trade of their town
and is also gaining for it too much
cheap tl6totiety.
The railroad boys "did themselves
proud" last Saturday night. Their
ball was one of the finest ever given
in Lafayette. The decorations were
simply beautifutl, and showed some
unusually tasty work. The atten
dance was large, the music good,
the tefreshments of the best, the
girls remarkably pretty and the boys
handsome and gallant; in fact
nothing was lacking to make this
event a success socially as well as
financially.
EdWards Nominated.
Dr. C. J. Edwards, of Abbeville,
was nominated for senator by the
Democratic convention in Lake
Charles Wednesday. The vacancy
in that district was caused by the
elevation of Don Caffery to the
United States. We believe Dr.
Edwards is in favor of the election
of Senator Caffery.
The Bagley Case.
A special from Abbeville, under
date of April 5, says:
The jury in the Martin Bagley
case was discharged this morning
at 8 o,clock by Judge A. C. Allen,
they not being able to agree upon
a verdict, having been out fifty
five hours. It was rumored around
town that eleven were for guilty
and one for acquittal. J. D. Mor
gan, one of the jurors, was ar
rested for perjury by the district
attorney, M. T. Gordy. Mr. Mor
gan, however, was subsequently re
leased on a bond of $Iooo.
Mr. Jos. A. Chargois, one of the
attorneys for the defense, informed
The Gazette that he would be in
Abbeville Saturday when an appli
cation to bail Bagley will be tried
by Judge Allen.
Primaries.
In the proceedings of the Demo
cratic PariSh Executive Committee
published in another column w:11
be seeat the resolutions announcifig
that primaries will be held on Sattii
day, April '4, to select a candidate
for representative.
Primaries, directly for the candi
date is the best way to obtain the
sentise of the voters and the commit
tee has acted wisely. The next
session of the Legislature will be
one of the most important ever held
in this State and it behooves the 1
Ihemdcrats of Lafayette to see thit i
the people are well represented in

Typical Frontiersman. h
Rufus Mouton, of Lafayette, La.)
a typical frontiersman, trapper and ti
hunter, attracted much attention in 8
the city Tuesday and Wednesday by ki
the peculiarity of his garb. He was
dressed in a buckskin suit, slouch
hat and wore his hair in long curls
art Buffalo Bill. "Bill" Cagney ri
told somebody that he was "Gen."
Fry, the commainder of the army of
700 tramps now on their way east
from Los Angeles to join the Ohio
army of the commonweal en route
to Washington. This somebody
told somebody else and soon large
numbers were flocking to the depot st
to see the leader of the hobo cohort.
Mouton could not understand why in
he was at'tacting so much attention
and, not wishing to be the cynosure to
of so many eyes, he sought a retreat is
in Wilson's restaurant.
The hunter has many traps set
for wild game along the banks of in

Commercial.
Married. fa
On Tuesday evening the 27th ul- K
timo there occurred ini New Orleans th
an event which will long be remem
bered by those who were fortunate us
enough to attend. It was the mar- T
riage of Miss Althea Roy, the pretty la
and accomplished daughter of Mr. ";
and Mrs. P. B. Roy of this parish, td St
Mr. Jules Alciatore; of 3few Orleans. wl
At the appointed hotit 7 o'clock; pe
to the strains of Meiidhlsohn's wed- of

and beautifully decorated parlor of at

potted plants, where Rev. Father pl
Mignot, of the Cathedral, per- of
formed the impressive ceremony. fo
The bride wore an elegant cream Li
satin en traine trimmed with real ac
lace and lilies of the valley, with lii
wreath and veil. The groom was se
quite handsome in his conventional T1
dress-suit. After the ceremony, ax
dancing was indulged iti until x x
o'clock when the gtdst9s were ihvited tb
to the large dining room below, ic
irhere a sumptious supper was C1
served. In the center of the room so
was the bridal table around which si
sat both families, while in the room El
was another table in the form of a
horse-shoe where the ISo guest cc
present were seated; ro
One of the entertaining features ev
of the evening was tlhe monologue wi
recited by Mr; Duboad; one of the gi
editors of the New Orleans Bee. cl:
Toasts were drunk to the health he
and prosperity of Mr. and Mrs. ca
Alciatore. Numerous costly and re'
elegant presents wiere received by lia

Carncro News.
From Our Regular Cd'resbi"hae.
-Dr. Chas. Chassaignac, one of
New Orleans' leading physicians,
was in town last week visiting the
familiy of D. A. Dimitry.
-We are informed that the
parishes of Lafayette and St. Lan
dry, have appropriated an amount
sufficient to rebuild and enlarge the
bridge at Ovide Guidry's. This is
an improvement that has been sorely
needed for a number of years; and
the condition of the old bridge has
been such as to deprive Carencro
of a large trade that was legitimately
hers.
-"Kite time" boys. Get your
tissue paper, cypress sticks and No.
8 thread, and show us what you
know about kite making.
-Judge O. P. Cuilbeau, was in
Lafayette for several days this week, a
attending to some important nota- t
rial work. Octove is a "hustler"
and no discount on that.
-Mr. J. D. Breaux, killed a hog
some days ago that weighed 712 x
pounds, and furnished 42 gallons
of lIad. It measured 7 feet 2 inches
in lerngth;
-Mr. Saul Broussard our efficient
street commissioner has been doing
an immense amount of work lately, t
in the way of improving our streets,
and the general drainage of the
town. He understands exactly what
is needed and works with a vim.
-The Valley of the Teche, uses
rather plain and pointed language
in dealing with the Knapps. There
is one thing very sure, and that is,
that our people have been most in
famously treated; but whether Prof.
Knapp is wholly reeponsible for d
that treatment, is something upon
which your correspondent has been
unable to form a decided opinion.
That there has been a most flagrant c
lack of businiess iianagement from
"start to finish" of the Teche R. R. s
Sugar Co., can not be denied, but c
whether Prof. Knapp is wholly and e
personally responsible for that state
of affairs, is hard to say.
-Mr. Lobdell one of our leading n
planters was a most welcome visitor h
at the ",roost" of ye cb*rCspbndent ti
last Sunday; He recorded in very e
clear and forcible language an em
phatic "'kick" against the long spell t
of bad weather we have been having t
for some time. Messrs Brown and s]
Lobdell, have increased their cane a
acreage very largely. "Evange- s
line" now ranks among the leading
sugar plantations of the parish.
This farm is a credit to our place A
and is well worth seeing.
-For the week eiding March 30 W
the following pupils of the pa)tchial l
gchool waere awarded medals: zst 9
Class, Miss Lucie Bernard "Les- h
sons;" and Class; Miss Daisy Brous- I
sird "'Lessons;" "Conduct" Miss '
Euchariste Mathieu.
-Mr. A. C. Guilbeat; will soon
commence the erection of a tho- d
roughly modern gin, complete in
every detail, and when finished
will, with the Farmers Union Gin,
give Carencro two thoroughly first
class plants. Last season the gins
here were crowded beyond their
capacity. Carencro has built upa
reputation for fair dealing in that
line of businefs; Which is known
and appreciated all over the parish; ,
and the consequence was that last A
season, cotton and cotton seed were
hauled to this place, from pioints
twelve to fifteen miles distant, and
it if the intention of our ginners to
hdlId and incre;ae thia trade,, and
*ili make all the nieeded ihprove
mients to accomodate it.

-Joe G. LeBlanc, familiarly

trip to Abbeville Saturdays returning
Sunday.
-It is rumored that Dr. Scranton
contemplates purchasing Mr. Alex.
W. Guidry's plantation.
-Ex-Post master Bonnemaison
was a visitor to Lafayette Tuesday
-A visit to an institution of learn
ing should siirely be one of appre
ciation, as at no other place imagin
able, can pleasant recollections of
dear old school days arise so vividly
to memory, as when striounded by
teachers and pupils. Monday last,
a brief call was made on Prof. Webb,
principal of the 4th ward public S
school situated here. In his usual
gentlemanly and unassuming style,
your correspondent was tendered a F
hearty welcome. The school house,
throughly ventilated and airy; is
sufficiently large to accomodate at
the very least zoo pupils. The
desks and benches are very good
ones, ahd the children are made as
comfortable as possible. The
school has an enrolled list of 65
scholars, with a regular attendance
of 45. The various methods em
ployed by Prof. Webb in the desci
pline and instruction of his several
classes, are certainly successfully
executed; as the rapid progress un
dergone by the childrei, denotes
with pride, how patient and con
scientious Mr. Webb is in the dis
charge of his duties: Previous to -
Prof: Webb taking control of this A
school, fully 76 of the children
could not understand a word of
english, whilst to-day; riot oily dd
they understand, but fluently speak a
the national language; sing the a
national songs and glorify in the
honor of being young citizens of
this great American Republic. Td
encourage the children in their
studies we have promised to mention
the names of the successful ones in
the monthly roll of honor, and C
space in our "items" will alwhays be
accorded thCni with pleasire. The
scholars in general are all doing re
markably well, and to much praise
cannot be given Prof. Webb:
Amongst some of the classes exhi
bited in our preSenCe, we may say
with justificatibn that the following
boys wirere exceptionally and apt
quick in their answers, to-wit:
Masters Young, David, Vallot, Ollii
Dyer, Landry, Langlinais, Guillotte,
Tabarlet; F. Theriot, Theall and
Hebert. CHEROKEE.
