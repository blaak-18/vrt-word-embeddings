The Fourth of July passed off
very quietly here, there heing lit
tle or no enthusinm. Sveral pic
ices, and one or two small fishing
parties was about the size of the
celebration.
It has been so hot, dry and dusty
that people felt indifferent, hence
the lack of interest manifested min
.cebrating the glorions day.

e Populist Vote.
The following vote was cast for C
straight People's party nominees
tor Representative or Senator, and I
is the nearest correct statement of t
e the Populist that can be had, al- e
I though in some of the parishes I
n like Iberia, we have a number of
votes but had no legislative ticket.
We give the name of the person
for ~which the vote was cast so
there may be no doubt of it being -
a Popalist vote :

The above vote is our lasis of )
representation in all State conven
tions, one delegate tor each 500 or
majority fraction of 500o, and one
from the parish at large, except t
Orleans which is given one dele
gate from each Senatorial district,
or 7 in all.
lion. D. E. James, Representa
tive from \\inn parish, has intro
duced and succeeded in passing t
through the House a bill to pro- I
hibit the indiscriminate burning
of the grass on wild lands.
In our hill country this has been
an evil of no small moment. Much
valuable timber is annually dos- I
troyed by the fires, and the grass
is gradually killed out by burning
the roots and by destroying the
"rough" and leaves which act as a
protection against frost and drouth.
Besides this, much fencing, out
houses and other property is des
troyed by catching flre from the
burning wood's. Many a Sunday
and other days have we fouzht the
fires back from our fences, and
then set in the woods the greater
part of the nizht to watch that it
did not c itch out again from the
smoking logs and coals.
It is to be hoped that the Senate
and Governor will permit this
measure to become a law.
Mr. James deserves great credit
for this and several other apt and
meritorious bills which he has put
through against great odds.
fMr. James is one of the strong
est Populists, but is popular with
all factions in the Legislature, and
his constituents have many reasons
to feel proud of him.

Grover Quiet-Hill "Regretful
Carlisle and Eckels's Idea of
the Farmer's Intellect.
Grover Cleveland has gone to
Buzzard's Bay; H hitnoy has gone
3 to Chicago; Dan Lamont is in the
throes of despair. The latter, who
was nothing before he became a
S cog in the Rothschild-Cleveland
machine, is really disconsolate.
t Poor fellow, wh9 can blame him !
I He became rich by sticking to G ro
t ver, and now he has been foolish
enough to sink his earnings from
the gold conspiracy in the Cleve
i land-Whitney-street railway pool,
and he feels bad. Grover is at
Buzzard's Bay, a good place for
s such a buzzard as he is, but the
men who sacrificed themselves up
on his altar are in a duce of a fix.
Rumor says that Grover has so
e fixed things that he will be reim
s bursed for any loss which he per
e sonally may sustain from the fail
ure of the street railway scheme,
but Carlisle, Smith, Lamont, and
Campbell are to be."souped."

fore it is best for mt to lv' l,oli

however. that so far as tihe Pop1li
lists in W\\:,hin.ttem are coneern.dt.
the People's party will ilndtrse in,
man who is not aceptt:tlIle tlo them.
It is hard for a Wa hington cor
respondent to plelae- all peIpl,. I
judge that the great pr'ulucii"ingi lIi)
piel want the truth. 'Tl'his is the
truth: If the silver Demo nrat.
nominate a man stiich a Teller or
Sibley, he clan _et the stiIlt t f
the Populists antI silver RIliplii
cans. If not, then not.
'T'hat is the con-en-l,is of opiniin
amon- the Populists and silverites
in 11 ashington. Thv siay : "TI he
)emocratic Iirty is deail if it tril'
to cirry the country upon the free
silver cry. The D)emocratic party
mnust give s:me piroof of its ,hones
ty. It nominated ( rover ( hlve
land three times. A party which
will chose as its standa Ird-I earcr
for twelve years such a scoundrel
as Grover Cleveland must be view
ed with suspicion."
If the silver I)emlocrats are real
ly patriots; if they rise above par
ty andt nominate a man acceptable
to the Populists and silver Repub
licans, he will be elected : if not.
then the true reformers should an
tagonize their tickets and make
such a tight for liberty that a 1)em
ocrat may be as extinct a bird four
years from now as a dodo.
That those who read my letters
may know how the producers of
the country are regarded by their
servants, 1 will reproduce a con
versation which I heard last Sun
day evening in Chamberlain's. The
two who talked are members of the
administration. I will style them
I C. and E. Of course this does not
I mean Carlisle. andl Eckels. If I
said so it would be libel. This is
how they talked :
SMr. C.: "I)o you think, E. that
you can switch enough delegates at
Chicazo ?"
Mr. E.: "Ihaven't I been control
line for ~ears. I'll switch them :
they don't know anything about
t the financial question anyway.
r Mr. C.: "'You're mistaken. The
o voters in Kentucky are just loaded
to the muzzle with argumienits ini
favor of the remonetization of sil
a ver, and they even quote that old
- speech of mine."
Mr. E.: "Pshaw, that's nothing'
We'll confuse them on the bIond
, question. They can't iunderstand
:I figures. One of my clerks whenn
I sent to Missouri to counteract
, the work of Taubeneck, toldi me
that he heard one farmer trying to
explain to another what the ditfer
ent bond denominations meant. The
a explaining farmer said that ,-ut's,
740's, and 14-5o's imeant that the
working man hadl to go to work at
7:30 a. m. and work until 7:30 p.I
Sm., in order that the usurer might
lie aed umtil 10:50 the next morn
ing."
Mr. C. laughed anl said the far
mer had the situation pretty well
sizod up. If nmiy friends through
out the country want to adopt the
S5:30, 7:40 10) plan, all right.
