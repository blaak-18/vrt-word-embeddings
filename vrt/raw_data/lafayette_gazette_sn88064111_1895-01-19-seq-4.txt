'iThe Cotton States and International
expooition to be held :in -Atlant, Ga.,
BSeptember 18 to December 21, 1895, is
intended primarily to bring together
an epitome of human efort and a col
lection of the important products in all
countries of .the western hemisphere.
Its scope is, however, interntional,
and exhibits are invited and expected
_rom all the other continents.
The United States has aided this ex
position by an appropriation of $200,000
for an exhibit similar in plan and scope
to the one made at Chicago. In the de
bate on the appropriation the most dis
tinguished orators of all political
parties vied with each otherin enthusi
astic commendation of the enterprise.
That debate and the action of the gov
ernment placed the exposition at once
upon an international plane. Inquiries
are already coming in from foreign
countries. President Dias has an
nounced his intention and determina
tion to make an exhibit of the resources
and products of Mexico.
The republic of Venezuela, one of the
most important in South America, cov
ering three times the area of Germany,
has formally accepted the invitation to
take part in the exposition. A similar
acceptance has been received from Nic
aragua. Unofficial advices from Bon
duras are to the efeeot that a fine ex
hibit will be made by that republiei
and a feature of the display will be a
mahogany house. The Mexican village,
Guatemalan village and Japanese gar
den will form picturesque features.
Besides the United States govern
ment building, the plan of the exposi
tion managers includes these principal
buildings; the last figure gives the
height from floor to cornice:

designed with an idea of stability and
simplicity of construction.. Take the
Machinery building, for instance.
That, in its interior construction, is a
simple cube so designed as to give a
great deal of space inside, its exterior
finish having a touch of the renais
sance. On each end, at the sides and
in the center there are large porticos
with immense pillars, which will give
the entire building a stately appear
ance. It is the aim to construct a build
ing whose size will not be apparent at
first, but which will grow on the ob
server. That building will be 65
feet high. The Manufactures build
ing carries out the same Romanesque
idea, but is considerably more elab
orate. In the Agricultural building
the idea is carried out in a sort of
pyramidal shape, and so, too, with the
Electricity building. The latter has
towers and arches which can be bril
liantly illuminated, and, located as it
will be, at the foot of the lake, a great
light effect can be secured. The towers
at the corners of the Nanunfactures
building are very large and can be
used for restaurant purposes or any
thing of the sort. The brdad outside
corridor on the second story of this
building can also be used to magnifi
cent advantage for restaurant pur
poses. The floor area of these buildings
is as follows: Manufactures and Lib
eral arts, 103,000 feet; Agriculture, 44,
000; Machinery, 96,500.
The Woman's building is to be de
signed by a woman. and a prize of $200,
in addition to the usual compensation
for architects, has been offered by the
board of lady managers. Asthe larger
buildings are of Rlomanesque motif, it
is proposed to have for the Woman's
building a colonial design, which will
harmonize and hold its own with the
larger structures.
The Government building will be of
frame construction, covered on the ex
terior with shingles and clapboards,
and designed with Romanesque motif.
MAIN ENTaANCE TO FINE ARTS BUILDING.
Its main dimensions will be 180 by 200
feet, with projecting pavilions 10 feet
by GO feet in plan on all four sides, and
circular towers 25 feet in diameter at
each corner of the building. niaking a
total floor area of about 50,000 square
feet. A cruciform clearstory GO feet in
width inceases the height of the
structure to 62 feet., and produces the
effect of a two-story building, and also
materially assists in lighting and ven
tilating the interior. At the intersec
tion of these clearstory wings: and
rising to a height of 105 feet, will be
co astructed a turreted tower, having at
at apex a platform for the exposure of
Instruments of the weather bureau. An
electric search light and a time ball
will be operated by the navy depart
mart at conspicuouspoints on the roof.

formed of natural trees, will bh coe
ered with bark, thus forming a most
unique design, covering an area of 26,
000 square feet, while a roof promenade
or garden, of the same area, is also
provided, the entire sides of which will
be formed of palms and palmettoes.
An enormous fountain adorns the cen
tral portion of the building, the back
ground of which is formed of minerals
from all sections of the south.
The Electricity building covers an
area of 19,500 square feet, and is lo
cated on one of the most commanding
sites on the exposition grounds. The
exterior of this building has been de
signed with particular reference to the
effects which may be gained by a use
of numerous electric lights. - It is also
proposed to illuminate the general out
line of all the buildings by ineandes*
cent lights, and the effect will be de
lightful.
The Transportation building will
cover an area of 55,000 square feet, and
is conveniently located for the instal
lation of the heavy exhibits proposed
for this building.
The Horticultural buildinzg will be
unique in desgn. A large central dome
of glass, with three wings or arms,
each ending in a smaller dome of glass,
will afford an opportunity for an ex
cellent display of the flora and fauna
of the south.
It is not srettled whether the educa
tional exhibit will have a separate
building, but it is more than likely
that the matter wil!. take that course.
Already the big Manufactures and
Liberal Arts building is shown to be
inadequate for the demands for space
in those departments, and a separate
building for liberal arts is already be
ing considered. This building would
be the natural home of an educational
exhibit. It is proposed to have a sam
ple of the work of every pupil in every
school in the south. This would bring
directly before the world the intel
lectual attainments of between four
and five million children. It is need
less to say that this will rivet the in
terest of the people upon the exposi
tion.
The Negro -building will be one of
the most interesting on the grounds.
It will afford more than 25,(00 square
feet of space, and will provide for a
large central assembly hall for negro
congresses, with openings into rooms
for exhibits. An epitome of the race
in thirty years of freedom will natur
ally be interesting, but especially so
when presented in the form of a pan
orama, showing the different condi
tionsof the negro from his native state
in Africa, with his thatched huts, by
successive stages to the most advanced
type of the race in Ameiica. It will
form at once a picturesque and inlttruc
tive exhibit.

Vvular disease of the heart has always

Intevie , therefore, will interest the med

ease The patient is Mrs. George Archer,
of Clifton, N. J., and this publication by
the News is the first mention made of the
case by any newspaper. All physicians con
salted pronounced the patient suffering
with valvular disease of the heart, and
treated her without the slightest relletf.
Mrs. Archer said: "I could not walk across
the foor; neither could I go upstairs with
out stopping to let the pain in my chest and
left arm cease. I felt an awful constriction
about my arm and chest as though I were
tied with ropes. Then there was a terrible
noise at my right ear, like the labored
breathing of some great animal. I have
often turned expecting to see some creature
at my side.
"Last July," continued Mrs. Archer, "I
was at tSpringfleld, Mass., visiting, and my
mother showed me an account in the
Springfield Examiner, telling of the won
derful cures effected by the use of Dr. :Vil
liams' Pink Pills for Pale People. My
mother urged me to try the pills and on
November 25th last I bought abox and began
taking them, and I have taken them ever
since, except for a dhort interval. The first
box did not seem to benetit me, but I perse

relatives. After beginning on the second
box, to my wonder, the noise at my right
ear ceased entirely I kept right on and the
distress that I used to feel in my chest and
arm gradually disappeared. The blood has
returned to my face, lips and ears, which
were entirly devoid of color, and I feel
well and strong again.

A CHAPTER ON SALT.
Seraps of Informatton About a Useful Ar
ticle.
Poeple do not eat salt by the teaspoon
ful as they do sugar, yet not a meal is
eaten during the day that does not
have a seasoning of salt disseminated
through it, and sugar could be much
easier spared from food than the more
humble saline article.
By some mysterious law of nature
salt is continually evolved from living
bodies, and must as constantly be re
ceived again in due proportion to the
loss. It is by the law of evaporation
that we enjoy our privilege of salt, as
it is now believed that the chief source
of it is from the ocean, although the
salt of the sea is bitter and a draught
of sea-water works madness in the
brain of him who drinks. It is esti
mated that individuals average a yearly
allowance of sixteen pounds of salt.
This does not mean salt in the bulk,
but the constituent which enters into
the system by the process of assimila
tion. Its necessity as an article of diet
is assured by its presence in the cor
puscles of the blood, where mustard
and pepper are assuredly not found.
The salt mines of the world are
among the most important schemes of
commerce, and the slightest change in
the method of manufacture is hailed
almost as a triumph of science. When
England began to export a pure white
crystal salt to India, the Iindoos would
not use it, they mistrusted its brilliant
whiteness and preferred the dark
native salt, which contrasted well with
their white rice. Time has overcome
their predjudice, and they now eat
freely of the English salt, while their
own has undergone a purifying process.
The salt used in England comes prin
cipally from the Cheshire mines, but
the continental salt is obtained from
different sources, especially from the
great- salt district of Austria, which
covers a large area, and has been for
many years a source of revenue to the
people of that locality. The Durren
berg mine at IIallein has been worked
steadily for six hundred years and
others have been like a patrimony,
handed down to its wvorkmen.
To the government the salt
mines are a regular profit. To go
down into these mines with leather
garments provided for visitors, to gaze
and taste, and wonder by the glimmer
of a horn lantern, has been one of the
privileges of the tourist in Austria.
The great crystal crypts are most at
tractive, and much lessdangerous than
their prototypes, the coal mines.
The salt wells of Syracuse are great
American industries, which are, how
ever, only two hundred and fifty years
old and were discovered by the Indians,
who were the originators of the salt
industry of this counttry, although they
were afraid to drink of the water, be
lieving it to have been salted by a
demon to poison them. Father Le
MLoyne, passing that way in 1053, evap
orated some of the water of which
they complained and obtained a pure
article of salt, which hlie carried to
Quebec. Next a national tree of the
five nations was planted on the shore
of the spring, and a treaty-making
council held. The Indians, however,
kept their possessions until after
the revolutionary war. Then a
small company boiled the water in
camp kettles on crotched sticks, and in
1778 the state bought the laud, stipu
latingitd future use as a salt manufaec
turing field, Twenty Indian chiefs
signed the treaty. Gov. Clinton, 1Vil
liam Floyd, Ezra L'Jlammedieu. Rich
ard Varrick, Samuel Jones, Ejgbert
Benson and Peter Gansevoort--all
names of historic interest-signed the
treaty for the state. In connection
with this is a historical incident which
showed what wise heads the forefathers
of the country carried on their shoul
ders. Thenalt-makers planned the Erie
canal, and after it was built, liquidated
three -million dollars of indebtedness
by simply increasing the tax on salt to
twelve and a half cents a bushel. This
aame amount was afterwards paid to
the state for taxes on the wells, and
twenty thousnaand dollars annually Ito
the treasury. The apparently cheap
provision for manrufaeturing givyes one

Concentrated thought, continued in, robs

When a five horse-power engine is made

going to break. Very often the hard

office will "bolt " his food in a few min
utes which will take hours to digest. Then
too, many foods are about as useful in the
stomach as a keg of nails would be in a
fire under a boiler. The ill-used stomach
refuses to do its work without the proper
stimulus which it gets from thie blood and
nerves. The nerves are weak and "ready
to break," because they do not get the
nourishllnent they requtire front the blood,
