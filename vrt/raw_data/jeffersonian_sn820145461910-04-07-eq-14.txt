Items of Timely Interest to Farmers
COWPEAS, SOY BEANS AND PEA
NUTS MAKE THE BEST PORK.
A spring born pig should be finish
ed for the market the following fall
or early winter. He should never be
kept through the first winter.
Many men of the South keep them
until they are from 16 to 24 months
old, but money is lost in handling
them in such a manner.
These pigs and the mothers should
be given the run of a pasture from
the time the pigs are born. Pasture
saves grain—and grain is high-pric
ed in the South.
Besides, the pigs do much better
than if they were confined in a dry
lot. Os course, some corn should be
fed while the pigs are on grass.
When the pigs attain a weight of
75 to 100 pounds they should be
rushed to a finish. To finish them
with the greatest economy, tempo
rary pastures should be provided.
There are several pastures that can
be used for grazing during these late
summer and fall months.
The cowpea and the soy bean are
both excellent crops to go along with
corn. When they are used pork is
made at a great profit, even when
the crops, at $8 an acre, are charged
against the gains.
Both the cowpeas and the soy
beans should be sown in the spring.
If quick maturing varieties are used,
either plant can be gotten ready to
graze by the first of August, and
oftentimes even earlier. They can
be depended upon to afford grazing
from thirty-five to fifty days, when
the animals should be transferred to
some other green pasture crop.
Probably the best crop to use after
the cowpeas or the soy beans are
gone is the peanut.
The peanut lies in the ground until
after the cowpeas or the soy beans
are gone, so the writer has been fol
lowing the practice of using the soy
beans first, and then changing the
hogs to the peanut pasture. By so
doing an excellent pasture crop is
available for 80 to 120 days. At the
end of this time the hogs are ready
to take off the pastures and be placed
in a small pen for a short finishing
period.
The four years’ experiments in
Alabama emphasizes the fact that
money is lost when corn is fed alone.
No farmer can afford to sell his
corn, as corn, on the market. He
can get a better price for it by feed
ing it to hogs on pasture, and allow
ing the hogs to market it for him. —
Prof. Dan T. Gray, Alabama Experi
ment station.
A GOOD HAY FOR HORSES AND
CATTLE.
Cow peas and sorghum sown to
gether make a good hay for any
horses or cattle. Break and thor
oughly pulverize your land, broad
cast either lot or stable manure, all
you can spare, or broadcast about
two hundred pounds of 10—2 —2
guano over your land just after
breaking, then harrow well. Sow on
top of this about one and one-half
bushels cow peas and one-half bushel
sorghum seed, amber seed preferred,
harrow in well and roll or drag. Most
any good, reliable seed house keeps
both. Sorghum seed generally sell
from one dollar to two dollars per
bushel.—Farmers’ Union News.
MAKING MONEY FROM HOG
LIVERS.
A farmer, connected by ’phone
with a near-by town, has an agree
ment with the retail butchers to pay
him twelve cents per pound for liver
sausage, made from hog livers. This
is how he prepares it:
I cook one head and two livers and
melts, put them through the sausage
mill, put back in the water they were
cooked in, putting in sage, pepper,
and salt and a heaping quart of meal.
Stir constantly, as it burns easily.
For this I get between $3 and $4 —
about $2.50 for my work.

THE ADVANTAGES OF DAIRYING.
One great advantage in dairying is
that it brings a good annual income
without impoverishing the land. In
fact, the tendency of dairy farming
is not only to maintain the fertility
of the land, but actually to increase
it. It is always noticeable in a neigh-,
borhood of progressive, intelligent
dairy farmers that the land is very
productive and the farms are well
kept.
We have received a very sugges
tive letter on the price of butter by
Mr. Hollenbeck. We agree with him
that butter will maintain a good
price for some time. We consider it
certain that all good dairy products
will command a good price for some
years at least. Hence there is no
reason why an intelligent, up-to-date
dairy farmer should not be highly
prosperous indeed, and truly prosper
ous. If he keeps good cows and
handles them and their milk by up
to-date methods, he will not only
have a good annual income, but his
farm will increase in productiveness
and therefore in real value.—lllinois
farmer.

TO SAVE THE PEACH CROP.
Much work has been done with a
view to discovering a satisfactory
remedy for peach brown rot.
The peach scab (often called
“black spot”) is another disease
which - seriously affects the peach
crop in all sections east of the Rocky
Mountains, although not causing such
serious losses as brown rot.
As the result of experimental work
by the United States Department of
Agriculture, a cheap and simple
remedy for this disease has been
found in the self-boiled lime-sulphur
wash. This can be applied during
the growing season with very little
danger of injuring the fruit or foli
age, and it is very effective. Further
more, by mixing arsenate of lead
with the fungicide, the curculio can
be destroyed at the same time.
The Department has just issued a
bulletin describing the preparation
and use of the remedy. This publi
cation will be of great interest to
peach growers in all sections. Ad
dress the Secretary of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C.
SOME PRUNING NOTES.
It is impossible to tell just how to
prune. There are a few vital princi
ples, however, that must be kept in
mind. Do not take out one-half or
two-thirds of the whole top in any
one year. A too severe pruning tends
to throw the tree out of balance and
promotes the growth of sap sprouts.
So far as possible make the open
ing in the tree by cutting out good
sized secondary branches rather than
cutting off the small laterals.
In cutting back one-year wood, cut
to a bud. If the wood is older, cut to
a branch. Never leave a stub. Paint
all large cuts with some preparation,
such as white lead, grafting wax, etc.
Leave the short straggling spurs on
the branches. These are the fruit
spurs.
Prune each year. Do the work be
fore the trees leaf out, so that the
orchard will be ready for the pera
tions that follow.—Prof. E. R. Ben
nett.

FIVE TEXTS FOR COTTON
FARMERS.
There is no crop that offers better
profits for good farming than cotton,
and there is no crop that keeps men
poorer when grown in the old single
crop way.
The poorest farms and the poorest
farmers in all the cotton belt are
where the most money has been
spent for commercial fertilizers with
the one idea of making cotton to
sell.
The day is not far distant when a
man will be ashamed to tell you that
his land is poor.
The advent of the boll weevel does
not mean that we should look for
new crops, but that we should farm
well with the old ones.
It is to the barnyard that we must
look for the future, and aided by it
we can make the South the greatest
farming section of the country.—
