Blunt, the two Breda's, Bill Tun- Six a
nard nd and wis, reinforced by Briggs,
late U. 8. Army, met and jawed and At t1
parted in the Court House on Friday Deli
night last. It was strictly in keeping
with the Radical organ's programme
of a few weeks since-one of the "few COt
quiet meetings," that the Radicals tier
were advised by that "oracle" to
have and hold. wit1

flew in the window, the patriot- W
ic (1) doings of "Blunt's crowd" would
forever remain a mistery to all the
world, save those who are blessed (t) -
with a card to the inner circle.

burden of his remarks was t omld

Swhich we take occasion to say is no

the heads of Grant and Hayes-as we m
said, Lewis "read off" line by line, tlb
like a song in church, while Blunt on
"ginathem "what it meant" in his nusua- ba
al stile. If Blunt can take in any sti
one ~lth Lords resolution-why, then nzi
his lieaters must be big fools, to say th
the least of it. hi
The Supervisor of Registration, t
who intends (at present) to give as a
fair (I) election, was, our little bird bf
says, present in full force, including, L
- we suppose, Tom Bonllt, clerk-bet- d(
ter known as Deputy Sheriff, and the w
Myers-Van Dnsen indictment thief. ºn
The inference is palpable, that a P'

intends to give us a fair election-
any body who inspects this Supervi- of

tilled dew from heaven, ought to be
"Dised," that is, shot on the spot- so
with a load of soft soap. P
Briggs is not a bad man, his rela- s
tions are unfortunate, and we are "
sorry to see him in such haild company p
-not that we have an interest in his to
welfare,; present, personal, and to °
come, but simply because we thought t
better of him--that is all.
Our 'Allttle bird" told us many (
things they did and said, and those
saying and doings have been laid
-rfore "the powers" who will take
du aetis.n thereon at the proper time
and in a proper manner.
