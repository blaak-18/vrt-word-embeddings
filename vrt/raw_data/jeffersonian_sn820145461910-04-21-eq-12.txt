OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
FROM BETHLEHEM.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. I wrote you once before, but
did not see it in print. I guess it
found its way to the waste-basket.
My Papa is the postmaster of this
place. He is also a subscriber to
The Jeffersonian and Magazine. We
have a nice school at this place, and
I am in the seventh grade. I will
close, hoping to see this in print.—
Your new Cousin, Drew Willie Bell,
Bethlehem, Ga.
NO SCRAP BASKET FOR YOU.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you admit
a little Georgia girl into your happy
band of boys and girls? My papa
takes The Jeffersonian and the Maga
zine. He thinks Mr. Watson a fine
man. He says he likes Mr. Watson’s
paper better than any we take. I do,
too. I hope to see this in print, but
I am afraid of the scrap basket.
Janie Futral, your riddle is a cow.
You must send me a post-card. I
will send a riddle: White as snow,
but snow it isn’t; green as grass,
but it isn’t; red as blood, but blood
it isn’t; black as ink, but ink it
isn’t. To the one who answers it
first, I will send a post-card. With
best wishes to Daddy Jim and Mr.
Watson, Yours truly, Ida Kay, Car
tersville, Ga., Route 4.
A NEW FRIEND.
Deal’ Daddy Jim:—l will write
you a few lines to let you know now
I am getting along. I am well. I
am a little boy twelve years old, and
in the fifth grade. I have two broth
ers and one sister. Igo to school at
Big Springs. My teacher’s name is
Miss Strikling. I will close for this
time.—Your new friend, Henry
Estes, Mountville, Ga., Rt- 2.
COULDN'T WAIT.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
for the first time. I see so many
nice letters that I could not put it off
any longer. I go to school every
day I can, and sure like it fine. My
teacher’s name is Miss Annie Lee
Vining. I am in the fourth grade.
I am ten years old, have blue eyes,
light hair, and fair complexion. I
live in the country, and sure like it
fine. I don’t think I would like to
live in town. I think the answer to
Thomas H. Griffin’s riddles are:
First, because they are both farthest
from the bark, and, second, a watch.
If these are not right, don’t laugh at
me. I will close by asking some rid
dles: Why is the man that misses
the train like a school mistress?
What is it the more you cut out, the
wider it is; the more you cut off, the
longer it is?—Youi* new friend, Bes
sie Denham, Thomaston, Ga., Rt. 5.
WHO KNOWS EDDIE UPTON?
Dear Daddy Jim:—lsn’t it pleas
ant to have children all over the good
U. S. A- writing to you and telling
their troubles, successes, and misfor
tunes? lam sure you enjoy it very
much, as I know I would. I think
the Post-Card Club a grand thing,
and my only wish is that it may
prosper more and more each year,
until it becomes the largest and best
Club in the United States. I would
be pleased to receive postals from
some of the members of the Club,
and will answer all that I receive.
Before closing my letter, I have one
request to make: Can any one tell
me of the whereabouts of Eddie Up
ton, last heard of in Devall’s Bluff,
Arkansas? I will return this favor
in any way possible. I will close,
wishing all the members and Daddy
Jim the best of success.—Your un
known friend, Lula Lyon, Pine Bluff,
Ark., 2021 East 7th Ave.
(If our Arkansas exchanges will
kindly copy this inquiry, The Jeffer
sonian will appreciate the favor.)
HURRAH FOR THE S. S. B.
Dear Daddy Jim: —How are you
all enjoying this fine spring weather?
I am enjoying it fine. Daddy Jim,
many thanks for that post-card you
sent me Christmas. Papa got me a
frame for it. I think Mr. Watson’s
home is very pretty. How many of
you Cousins are lovers of flowers?
I am, and have a good many flower
seed planted. I have a few box
flowers, but I don’t like them as well
as yard flowers. My father Yias Yieard
Mr. Watson speak OAice, and has one
of his knives. I long to see the day
when he is elected President. If I
was allowed to vote, I would vote for
him andt no one else. My father is a
farmer, and raises many things. He
planted about an acre of sorghum
last year, and got eight tons of hay
from it. We raise nearly all kinds
of vegetables. For pets, I have one
turkey, a pig, and a lot of sweet lit
tle chicks. I am a great lover of
chickens, and attend to them all the
time. I have two sisters at home,
and I am the least one. I will de
scribe myself: I am five feet tall,
weigh eighty-two pounds, blue eyes,
dark hair, and a fair complexion.
Now you know I am a dandy. Hur
rah for the Sunny South Brother
hood! The answer to one of Thomas
H. Griffin’s riddles is a watch. Well,
I guess I had better get my hat and
go before you run me off. Please
send me some copies of your paper.
—Your friend, Lettie Rockett, Lillie,
La., Rt- 1.
LETTER FROM MISSOURI.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l wrote to you
some time ago, but did not see my
letter in print, so I will try again.
I will not write about the Sunny
South Brotherhood, for I don’t know
much about it yet. I am going to
read about it in The Jeffersonian.
The fruit trees here are in full
bloom. My little brother and I are
going barefooted, and have been for
quite a while. My school is out now,
and I scarcely know what to do.
Guess I will take music lessons. That
will keep me pretty busy if I practice
as much as my teacher wants me to.
My brother and I have been fishing
several times and caught a good
many fish, but they were so little
we threw them back. Ido not go to
Sunday-school. I used to, but have
not been for a long time. We do not
live close enough to a church where
they have Sunday School. I never
missed a day from school last win
ter, went every day for seven
months. My teacher gave me a half
dollar for coming every day, and a
nice book for getting headmarks in
my spelling class. I hope somebody
will guess E. B. Busbee’s riddle, for
1 am sure I can’t- I am not a very
good hand to guess them, any way.
—Your little friend, Imogene Boyle,
Centralia, Mo., Route 3.
FROM A TENNESSEE BOY.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes an
other Tom Watson boy from Ten
nessee, but my distributing mail of
fice is Corinth, Miss. I am twelve
years old, have dark hair, brown
eyes and fair complexion; weight,
100 pounds. I am not going to school
now. I am in the sixth grade. 1
am a farmer’s bo>, and like Bible
questions and riddles, too. I will
ask a question and some riddles:
(1) What is the shortest verse in
the Bible? (2) As I went over to
Wholety Joelty, I looked at Jesty
Westy; and there I saw Mr. Rigger
moreoly carrying away my pipeatoe
ly. Ah! if I had my hatterclatter, I
would show Mr. Riggamorroely how
to carry away my pipeatoely. (3)
Has four legs and four eyes, yet
can’t see or walk. I think the reason
why a tree’s heart and a dog’s tail
are so much alike is because they are
so hard. To those who answer my
riddles and question correctly, I will
