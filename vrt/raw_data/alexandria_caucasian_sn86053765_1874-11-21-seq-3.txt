THE RETURNING BOARD.
A COMMITTEE OF CITIZENS TO BE
PRESENT AT THE COUNTING
OF THE VOTES.
The interest of our citizens natu
rally centering now in the doings
of the Returning Goard sitting in
New Orleans, we publish below the
proceedings up to our latest mails :
I From Friday's bulletin.]
Yesterday :il>ont 10 o'clock, the mom
hers of tins Returning Board commenced
to assemble, and at 10:30 tliey were all on
hand, Tom Anderson included, with the
exception of Lougstrcct, whose non-arri
val delayed the call to order until 10:50
o'clock, when he put in an appearance.
Anderson had been duly qualified some
two hours previous, Judge Atocha admin
istering the oath.
After the meeting was declared ready
for business, Mr F. Zacliarie, as one of two
counsel (the other being Mr. Fergus Fuse
lier) for Hon. J. (J. Moncnre, presented
their power of attorney to represent liirn,
and claimed under the last clause of the
third section the right to do so, and
his representative to be present at the
count, and compilation of the vote.
Wells went into a cross-examination, all
tending to ascertain if the object of the
gentlemen in being present, was not to su
pervise the action of the board.
Mr. Zacliarie assured him that it wns
merely to guard the iiiteresrs of the M.
Moncnre. There mi^ht arise in the count
of the vote, something that would mili
tate against, them, and it was for the pur
pose of having a voice under such circum
stances that had actuated them in makiu"
the application. t
After some further talk, Anderson ask
ed if it would not be .just as satisfactory
if the Board should agree to allow a com
mittee of three, appointed by the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, to be
present during the sessions of the Board.
He made the suggestion to facilitate
matters, because if Mr Moncnre was al
lowed a representation all the other can
didates could demand the same right. It
would be better to have a'committee rep
resenting all the candidates.
Mr. Zacliarie said that it would be sat
isfactory ho had no doubt.
The board agreed to allow the committee
to bp present, and at the request of Mr.
Zacharie's time was granted fur the mak
ing of the appointments, Mr. Wells, of Iiis
own motion, giving until 10 o'clock this
morning.
The board then went into executive
session. On the executive session beinjr
raised the board adjourned nul il 10 o'clock
to-day.

[From Saturday's Bulletin.]
It was 11:05 o'clock when the Board

essrs. Zaclia

the Democratic State Central Committee!
present, and l.fie usual number of the cu
rions in attendance, in the hull. j
Tlier« H»«cnis to hoiiio imsiinrirrsf and-1
in-r in rvferoTie«? to the ntteridanee of tin* I

the hoard ; arid for the heneiit of ««very- i
\l/ t. That the ""âct Ys"'ù
«»»f<' r8 powers <
body in general, and the, csudidates in
particular, the statement is made that the
aetion of the State Central Committee in
appointing representatives does not inter
fere witli or prejudice the rigin, of candi
dates, under the law, to have their ecuin
se! present, at the canvass of the votes.
After the approval of the minutes of the
meeting «f Thursday, several oi'a number
of coinmnnicalioiiK received liy the hoard
were read
They were from a number of the can
didates on the Democratic, awl Conserva
tive ticket, claiming the l ight, to 1»; rop
resented by counsel at tho canvass of the
returns from their respective diKfricls.
and requesting notification of the day and
hour when such canvass would he made.
Further reading was dispensed with un
til the Democratic comiuil ioe could be
heard from.
Mr. Zacliarie said that in pursuance of
the suggestion of the board, the Demo
eralie Conservative State Central Com
mittee had appointed a eommitjeo to be
present at too proceedings of tin; hoard.
The committee had appointed live gentle
men, but claimed as a right under the
agreement, the admission of but three at
on" time.
It was the understanding that the can
didates would acquiesce in the action of
tho committee, but they took advantage
of their right to make application for the
privilege of being represented at (he
count .of the votes, so that in case the
communication between the committee
and the board should bo interrupted,
their rights would not bo passed by, with
out a hearing,
lie said further that the Committee do
sired to have spread on t he minutes a pro
test against the Hoard proceeding with
the count of the votes. Tho protest had
not been formally drawn up, but it was
made oil the following grounds :
nconstitntional, in
nn tho board that
belong solely to the judiciary.

2. Admitting tho constitutionality
the act, its provisions have not, been com
plied with in the organization of the board,
ou which the Democratic party is not rep
resented. The law provides that all pai>
ties shall pe represented.
Mr. Wells said that so far as the ques
tion of tho constitutionality of the act was
concerned, it was one tor tile courts to de
cide.
il/r. Zacliarie replied, admitting the fact,
but said that the committee desired to he
placed on record as having objected, so
that, in case of proceedings hereafter, ac
inicsee in the organization and constitu
tionality of the Hoard could not ho urged
against those appearing in such proceed
ings.
The Board decided to allow time until
to-morrow morning for the protest to be
formally drawa up and presented for ac
tion.
Gen. Anderson said that, on the ques
tion oi organization it should be remem
bered that at the time the board was
tomposed, all parties at that time in the
field were represented. He did not wish
a canvass to be made that the people
would not consider fair, and he was wil
ling to resign if his resignation could bo
made use of to satisfy ttie people.
Messrs. Wells and Cassanave both ex
matter of
resigning was one to be considered at the
proper time, and suggested that the
Board proceed.
All communications from candidates
were received and filed.
Amotion to admit a committee of the
Republican Executive Committee to the
proceedings of the board, was adopted.
1 lie returns were sent for. but on their
ariival Ueul Anders
on stated, ou the iu
cal
BE
in
the
:
on
the
j
formation of Mr. Zacliarie, that the Demo
cratic Committee was not ready to pro
ceed with the cmint, and moved that time
until to-morrow morning be granted.
Thero was some little discussion as to
the propriety of opening the returns in
proper order, so that the canvass could be
gin immediately when the Board next as
sembled.
It was decided not to disturb the packa
ges until everything was ready for the
count.
Mr. Zacliarie suggested that the board
in the canvass should proceed by parishes,
taking them up alphabetically.
Mr. Wells said that thero was consider
able cxcitemcnt over the vote in this par
ish. and a very evident desire that the
candidates claiming to be elected should
be installed as early as possible.
Zacliarie submitted a resolution adopted
by the Democratic Conservative candi
dates agreeing m»t to qualify until the
whole vote of the State hail beeu cau
vassed.
After some discussion the board decided
to commence 011 the parish of Orleans.
On motion of Gen. Anderson, au ad
journment until 10:30 o'clock this morn
ing was ordered.
[From Tuesday's Bulletin.]
There was tho usual gathering of hang
ersou yesterday about the rooms of the
Returning Board, eager to catch anything
of note coming from either the members
or those who had tho entree. Up to 11:15
but two of the members had put iu an ap
pearance, aud it was evident there was no
hurryou their part to push matters. At
11:30 A. M. ox-Gov. Wells took the chair ;
present Anderson. Cazeuave and Kenna
Messrs. Zacliarie, Whitaker and Fuse
lier, 011 the part of the candidates, bein
in attendance.
After calling the roll and reading of the
minutes, nominations were then declared
in order, to fill the vacancy occasioned by
the resignation of Gon. Longstreet.
John M. Sandidge, Esq., was then put in
nomination, who was unanimously elected.
Gen. Anderson then moved that the re
turns ho takeu and the count bo proceed
ed with.
At this juncture Mr. Zacliarie arose and
stated that he thought this the proper
time to present the arguments upon the
questions and issues already raised. It
had been agreed, he said, by counsel 011
both sides, to do this, and he was now
prepared to go into the argument. Gov.
Wells stated that the Board had conclu
ded in order to save time, to receive
briefs on tho issues instead of oral ar"ii
inent. "
Mr. Zacliarie answered that it would be
next to impossible to submit a written
brief011 <*very point, and that it wovld
take more time than the submission of the
different points orally.
Gov. Wells said the law pointed out the
manner of conducting the canvass.
Mr. Zacliarie rcrponded that tho ques
tion of the certification of some of the
polls had been sprung upon them, and
perhaps came outside tho law.
Gov. Wells then said that it would be
preferable to have the fifth member
present.
Action 011 the matter of the argument
was postponed until the arrival of Mr.
Sandidge.
returns of the First Ward were
I ÎÎ H n and poll 1 4 commenced,
^ en * ,el \ suggested that as there was a
i tli« package of returns marked
Sundry papers," he thought that
might refer to the poll vote, and asked
that it be examined, which Was agreed to.
Up to the hour of going to press Mr.
Sandidge had not put, in an appearance
and the counting was still going 011.
The board, at closing, had tiuished the
I'irst Ward, and progressed as far as the
eleventh poll of the Second Ward. This
morning it is probable, there will be an
argument over the issues undeeided.

The Citoi 's. —The cotton crop is
now about picked out and is
being rapidly ginned aud pressed.
We have taken pains to ascertain
and find that the average yield has
been fully a bale to the acre.
The frosts have seriously injured
the cane crop. They came so un
expectedly that they caught it all
standing. We do not know how
much it will cut the crop short, but
we suppose that it will be one third
at least. The cane is not edible
now.

Sister! we liavo longed to speak it!
We have waited long to save ;
We have yearned to speak the welcome—
" Enter—be no more a slave !"
Every tear that fell, we saw it,
As we braced to meet tho shock ;
Now ! Come in—the door is open,
Sit thon here by Plymouth Rock.'
We have seen thee all disheveled,
Seen thee bend with trembling lip,
When the men who should have loved thee
liaised again the brutal whip.
But we kuew their day was coming,
As we know their day has come :
King their doom, Louisiana !
Massachusetts drives them home !
Qneori thou wert in all thy sorrow :
Queen thou shalt be yet in pride,
Maiiy.throned Columbia calls theo
Where her queens sit side by side.
And thy regal robes are ready,
And thy crown is on the throne,
For we knew our Cinderella
Would come hack to claim her own.
Nevermore shall one be driven
To the desert : nevermore
Shall the children of the Union,
O11 their brethren bar the door.
God be thanked tor love grown stronger :
Heart and hope go hand in hatid.
We are North and South no longer
