stone, and who will examine the stu
dent from time to time, advising him
kindly as to his studies.
Reading law in this way does not
interrupt any other work in which
the boy may be engaged. I, myself,
read law at night, while teaching
school in the day time. This has
been done in numberless cases.
Where the student, and would-be
lawyer, has the money, and can af
ford the expense, it is, doubtless,
better to attend a law school, but it
is by no means necessary that he
should. Alexander H. Stephens pre
pared himself for the profession by
reading two or three months. This
can be done by any industrious, in
telligent young man, for, after all,
it requires practice in the Court
Room to rake a good, practical,
case-winning lawyer.
After Blackstone’s “Commenta
ries” have been finished, you might
read Kent’s “Commentaries”, which
apply peculiarly to modern condi
tions and to the American system.
Then you should read “Greenleaf
on Evidence”, or some other stand
ard authority on that subject. After
this you might read “Bishop on
Criminal Law”, or some other stand
ard work on that. If you have the
time, you could very profitably em
ploy it by reading “Cooley’s Consti
tutional Limitations”, or some other
work on Constitutional law. This,
however, is not necessary to your ad
mission to the bar and your begin
ning of practice in the common law
courts of Georgia, or any other
State. The Code of Georgia, you
will, of course, study.
As a matter of fact, while it is ex
ceedingly useful to read the books
which I have mentioned, you could
become a first-class lawyer, (so far
as practicing in the Courts is con
cerned,) by confining your studies to
the Code of this State, and to the
decisions of our Supreme Court.
Our laws are so plainly written, and
the decisions of our Courts are so
thoroughly annotated, that the stu
dent who masters the Code, and who
familiarizes himself with the decis
ions made upon the various ques
tions of civil and criminal law and
of pleading and practice, and of the
rules of evidence, will have become
a thoroughly equipped attorney for
all practical purposes.
Blackstone is read in order that
the student may have a knowledge
of the historic origins, and the true
meaning of our various legal max
ims, etc. Comparatively little of the
lore contained in Blackstone or Coke
applies to our own time. The learn
ing is what we call “obsolete”. We
read it as we do history, to learn the
origin of things.
Yours very truly, T. E. W.
GOOD WISHES FOR THE JEF
FERSONIANS.
Dear Sir:—The Jeffs are certainly
“live wires”, and the man who can
read them without feeling the shock
must certainly be very deep in the
rut of indifference.
They demand the attention of
thinking men and women wherever
they go.
I hope the friends to these publi
cations will put their shoulders to
the wheel, this year, and help roll
up a subscription list that will touch
every nook and corner of this old
country of ours.
Assuring you that I put in a lick
for The Jeffs whenever I have the
opportunity, I am
Lincoln, Alabama.

ANOTHER CONVERT TO DOMES
TIC MISSIONS.
My Dear Sir: —I have been quite
interested in your articles regarding
Foreign Missions. They appear to
me to be based upon a strong founda
tion, and until the present conditions
of our country are overcome, I be
lieve no hurricane in all Christendom
can weaken them. Among our peo
ple today , in the cities and the coun
try, the crying need is for a “helping
hand.” We should organize our
selves as a Christian people, the
church ought and is to a great ex
tent our stronghold, to pull together
as brothers and sisters for the pro
tection and perpetuation of mankind,
the uplifting of humanity. It is true
we must give credit to our churches,
but they are at fault when they are
so earnestly endeavoring to educate
and cultivate heathendom at the
great sacrifice of our own people. It
is also true the churches are the
greatest institution we have in our
land today,—l don’t think you will
deny that fact, God-founded and God
inspired, and it often puzzles me
what they expect to accomplish. Now,
I take the same stand as you do, as
did my mother, whom I consider one
of the most refined and cultured wo
men, a church-worker, and was loved
by all who knew her, “Practice what
you preach at home,” if such evils
exist among our own people, or, if
we are giving heathendom something
they are deprived of, then after our
obligation along this line is perform
ed we are commissioned as a civiliz
ed people to use our influence in
spreading the gospel in other lands,
for the standard of Christendom.
It makes me grow sick at heart
when I look into the United
States postoffice and see negro clerks
in the majority, and on railway
trains in the employ of the Uni
ted States Government, working
along with men of our own flesh and
blood. I often wonder in amaze
ment if these white men feel humili
ated over such conditions; as Uncle
Sam’s almighty dollar makes us
stand a lot when it means our bread
and butter, especially so when a wife
and little children are dependent
upon us for support.
I have been a great admirer of you
since your articles on Foreign Mis
sions. We have a young man in our
office who is a staunch Watson man,
likewise his father. My associates up
to this time being practically anti-
Watson, I, of course, naturally was
led to believe ’most anything, but
since you jumped on Broughton and
the other Foreign Mission fanatics, I
began to read for* myself and see for
myself. As a result thereof, it has
converted me to the right side, re
gardless of politics, and from your
great amount of surplus information,
it is my opinion that you are the best
all-round informed man our country
today has.
Very truly yours,
W. B. WALTHOUR.

MISSOURI MAN LIKES TO BE

Dear Sir: —Enclosed find check
for sl.lO for renewal of subscrip

Jeffersonian Magazine) and ex
change. I don’t want to miss a copy.
You are performing a great public
service, and are entitled to the grat

In these days it is refreshing to
find a man possessed of the courage
and ability to make the fight you
are making for the South and West.

this infamous slanderer.

LONGS FOR A CYCLONE IN
POLITICS.
Dear Sir:—l am anxious to see
what Senator La Follette will give
the people. Being a rebel under
Stonewall, 1 have never voted a Re
publican ticket and never voted a
Democratic party ticket since 1888,
though I voted for Watson and Bry
an in 1900, but had no use for
Bryan. Since 1900 have no respect
for or confidence in the pledges of
the Delilah of Democracy. But
watchman, what of the night! The
West repudiating her stand-pat Con
gressmen, and the South her coal oil
Senators. Will it create a political
cyclone, or calm down to a gentle
breeze by the ides of November,
1910? I long for the cyclone.
How many more Rev. Towsons
will try to stick pins in T. E. W.?
It is the truth that hurts! The hit
dog that howls! The more the Tow
sons stir up the puddle the muddier
it will get. 1 have not contributed
anything to foreign missionary funds
for twenty years. Nor do I intend
to. I have enjoyed the lively tilt be
tween you and the preachers. But
it strikes me that the ammunition is
exhausted when the crowd gets down
to misrepresentation and villification
and personal slander. Those very
pious brethren have forgotten our
Lord’s injunction that when smitten
on one cheek to turn the other one.
1 our exposures of these unwarrant
ed expenditures to no good purpose
has done much good. You have not
left one single prop for them to lean
on. Being past seventy-five years,
I am so nervous it is difficult for me
to write. You have my best wishes
for success, both personally and po
litically.
Yours truly and fraternally,
R. S. DAVIS, M.D.

WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MASS
ES MORE SELF-RELIANT.
Dear Sir: —As my time for The
Jeffersonians is about to expire, I
enclose postal order for renewals.
1 have been reading your periodi
cals from the People’s Party Paper
until now. I am glad that our Gov
ernment has at least one man who is
conscientious enough to speak what
he believes to be true, regardless of
fear or favor. If you can educate a
little more self-reliance into your
readers, and a courage to contend
for their rights, at least some good
will be accomplished.
Another wrong our people are
guilty of, is voting in the old party
primaries. I believe when one votes
in a primary, he is honor bound to
support the successful candidate of
that primary. lam so strongly con
vinced of this truth, that my own
skirts are clear of the pollution of
voting with the crowd I do not be
lieve in. Does history give a single
instance where large bodies have re
formed within themselves? If it has
never been so in the past, can we
hope it will in the future? If this
is true, the man who believes the old
parties are corrupt, and still affili
ates with them, is corrupt himself,
or is too weak to assert his man
hood. Perhaps moral cowardice is
the trouble of our times. If it were
not so, there would have been no
need for your timely criticism of
mission boards, nor of Socialism or
Catholicism.
Husband your strength, for the
battle has just begun. The hosts are
coming together, and with proper

ON PICKET DUTY FOR THE
JEFFS.
Dear Sir: —1 am writing you this
short letter' to say that you may ex
pect me to be as loyal to you and
The Jeffersonians this year as I have
been in the past. You will find me
on picket up here in Hart county at
any time, and when I am needed
down at Thomson, sound the bugle
and 1 will be there.
You raised Cain the past year,
and we are expecting you to raise
the Devil this year. It is just as
important for some one to roust him
out now as it was when that man
Dow made him shuffle out, and if
you can't do it, I can’t think of any
one else that can do it. I remem
ber it was an easy job for you to
show us how to find the negro in the
woodpile. So, shake the bushes: we
are standing guard.
