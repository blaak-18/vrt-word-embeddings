MY CASTLE IN THE AIR.
If I could go ballooning,
And had the time to spare,
I'd journey to discover
My castle in the air.
It stands. that stately building,
Beyond the yellow moon.
W'here tradesmen's bills can never come,
Not even by balloon.
He eyes its door in vain,
Because its oistern runs with,
No water, but champagne.
1se Its roof has been constructed
s So very high and steep,
No love-lorn cats can clamber there
To frighton gentle sleep.
It With' My neighbor's hens can never
Defy the garden wall,
Because there are no neighbors
Or hen coops near at all
So in the garden nodding.
TTE, LA. Is rich profusion grow
Tobacco trees and cauliflowers,
And roses all a-row.
01 could I reach my castle,
I'd never need to think,
And clothe my dreams in Ink. t
IE, d naever need to scribble know ho
I'll hire a big balloon.
A n1 all away with--I know whom
liyond the yellow moon. t
