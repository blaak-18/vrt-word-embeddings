Summary of Ebents as They Happen

Appeals for the Dis-
Gompers Case
Decided.
ing case of the Buck’s
Stove & Range Company vs. the Amer
ican Federationist, out of which grew
the sweeping injunction of Justice
Gould, which was violated by Messrs.
Gompers, Mitchell and Morrison, and
brought about the famous contempt
case in which Judge Wright sentenced
these labor leaders to fines and im
prisonment. The decision of Justice
Robb appears one that will be accept
ed'by most people as entirely reason
able and fair. While affirming the
decision of Justice Gould enjoining
the furtherance of a boycott by publi
cation of the name of this company
in the specific list of “We don’t Pat
ronize” and “Unfair,” he takes oc
casion to re-affirm the principle of
press freedom from censorship, hold
ing that the defendants could not be
stopped from all publication referring
to the Buck Company, but only such
as were made in support of an illegal
boycott. Justice Vau Gradel went
even further and criticised Judge
Gould’s decision as one that, if per
mitted to stand, would “mark the be
ginning of an era of judicial tyranny
oy the branch of the government
charged with the duty of protecting
the citizen in his constitutional or le
gal right.”
Justice Shepard, sitting in the case,
expressed himself in favor of a modi
fication of the decree “so as to re
strain the acts only by which other
persons have been or may be coerced
into ceasing from business relations
with the Buck Stove and Range Com
pany; but so as not to restrain the
publication of the name of that com
pany in the I We Don’t Patronize’ col
umn of the American' Federationist,
no matter what the object of such pub
lication may be suspected or believed
to be,” but it is probable that the de
cision of Justice Robb will more near
ly meet the views of the majority of
people, who would loathe the judicial
tyranny which would prevent criti
cism in the public prints, but who do
not, on the other hand, favor anything
that smacks of persecution by publi
cation.
However, all has gone very well,
and it would have been much better
had Mr. Gompers awaited this decis
ion before rushing into the attitude
of contempt of Court, which tended
to confuse matters and render the
case complex.

that certain capitalistic papers

Dissatisfaction with certain condi
tions existed among the workers, as
will certainly happen so long as men
are human, but the adjustment of the
difficulty makes the strike worth
while as an object lesson in the har
mony that really underlies legitimate
government enterprise. There was no

men were satisfied that the govern

an integral part, would rectify their
grievances. The government, on the
other hand, had no humiliating terms
to prescribe, no strike-spirit it desired
to crush. And so government owner

of Servia to resist invasion. Russian
sympathy appears to be on the side
of the Servians, who are largely Sla
vonic people, which sympathy has
doubtless inspired them to hope to
resist the strong armies of Austria.
A late dispatch says:
In his efforts to secure peace be
tween Austria-Hungary and Servia
Sir Edward Grey, the British minis
ter, has sent a third and last note to
Belgrade suggesting a spontaneous
recognition of the annexation of Bos
nia and Herzegovina. The note is
couched in such terms as to call for a
sincere and straightforward response.
If this is not forthcoming the recall
of Austria-Hungary’s minister doubt
less will follow at once. Every day
that the strained relations between
the two governments continue results
in heavy losses to commercial and
agricultural interests and the situa- ’
tion can not exist much longer with
out a war. Regiments are being sent
to the front almost daily, and Austria
is determined, if the conflict comes,
to make it short and decisive. The
abdication of Crown Prince George
of 'Servia because he was accused of
the murder of his valet has stirred
Belgrade to fever heat. Prince
George is a jingo of the most pro
nounced type and an ardent hater of
Austria. Although his dissolute ca
reer made him an unlikable man,
many of his subjects sympathized
with him because he was a bitter
enemy of Austria.

ing of Crazy Snake
and his band of Creek Indians. A
war of complete extermination will
be the outcome, unless the Indians
yield. All of which is pathetic, as
the insurrection of the pitifully small
band of Indians grows out of their
inability to recognize the futility of
contention. They want the old home
undisturbed, the old customs of the
tribe, and planned a revolt that means
unnecessary bloodshed of both reds
and whites.
The inoffensive citizens of Okla
homa must be protected from the
sporadic riotings of the Indians upon
the reservations, of course, but the
treatment accorded the Creeks, the
advantage taken of their helplessness
and the wrongs perpetrated upon
them will probably never be fully
known. Certain it is that the Gov
ernor and many of his fellow-citizens
are under grand jury indictment for
land frauds, forgeries, etc., practiced
against the wards of the nation. And
the history has been a succession of
such injustices.
