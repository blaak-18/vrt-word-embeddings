THE NEGRO QUESTION.
Nearly everybody has a solution of
the “negro question’’ to offer the ig
norant public, and “Fuss” is no ex
ception to the rule:
The negro is an IMITATOR. He
is an imitation of the human being,
just as the ape is an imitation of
the negro. In Africa he acts natural
ly. In the United States he tries to
imitate the white people.
The negro is what the white peo
ple make him. When he does some
thing here that he does not do in Af
rica it is a trick picked up from us
white people.
So long as we continue to hang
Coca-Cola “ladies” in public places
for Bro. Sambo to gaze upon, so long
we may expect for certain hellish
crimes to be enacted by the “beasts
of the fields.”
So long as we continue to talk im
morality in the hearing of the negro,
just so long we may expect him to
play the act.
So long as we continue to sell
goods to the negro on credit just so
long we may expect to be unable to
control him in any way.
Human beings use reason in all
things. Beasts have no reasoning
power. This is why hanging Sambo
Ito the crooked trees in our land does
deter him from repeating his
' If your old ram jumps the fence
in the presence of your billy goat
the billies will immediatelly try to
imitate the old ram. And if you
shoot one of the dear billies as an
object-lesson to the balance as to
what they may expect if they do the
same thing, it has just the same ef
fect upon them that hanging Sambo
has upon the balance of his species.
Quit displaying immoral pictures
and other things of like nature in the
presence of the negro. Mind how
you talk in his presence. Never ar
gue with him. Do not sell him pis
tols and other things he should not
have. Do not sell him anything on
credit nor loan him anything, and
you will thus throw him on his own
resources, and when you do this you
will see Bro. Sambo and his “cullud
ladies” go to work. When you get
them strung out at work you will
see signs of contentment and happi
ness growing among them, and worry
on the part of the whites will die
away, and crimes by the negro will
be few and far between.
The white women can do a big
part in solving the “negro question”
by doing all their own cooking and
other household work. It will force
the negro woman to go to the fields,
where nature intended them for, and
this will also force millions of big,
black, greasy bucks to go to work

that the negro women are now feed
ing out of your kitchens. And when
all this takes place there is going to
be fewer jobs than hands, and as
they must work or starve, they will
beg you for a job instead of you beg
ging them to work for you. Then
wages will be cut to where they can
make only enough to live off of each
day they work, which will naturally
force them to work every day. And
when this is done the “negro ques
tion” will be a thing of the past. And
they will then have to quit sending
their kids to public schools at the
expense of white people. And when
we prevent them getting a book edu
cation we are doing a favor to them
as well as to ourselves. An educat
ed negro compares favorably with
an educated billy goat. Both are a
nuisance.
Treat the negro right in every par
ticular. But stop right there.
Jimmie Vardaman and Tommie
Watson can peel and repeal, codify
and modify the U. S. Constitution all
they want to. But it will not amount
to much until our plan is put into
operation, and they ought to know it.
As to what the Northern fanatics
say about our plan, we don’t give a
cuss. They DO NOT know what they
are growling about. —From “Fuss,”

BARBARISM IN MEXICO.
American Investigator Declares it Has
Its Siberias and Spy System.
Under the caption, “Barbarous
Mexico,” the American Magazine for
October presents a striking article.
The author, John Kenneth Turner,
bases his statements on personal ob
servation of conditions in nearly every
part of Mexico.
“Mr. Turner,” says the editorial
.introduction, “has penetrated into
regions such as the terrible Valle
Nacional, where slavery in its worst
form is found. He has gathered his
information from important business
men and politicians, often when they
were unaware of the nature of his
mission.
“We had supposed Mexico to be in
some sense a republic, and not, as
r ' find it, a government more abso
lute and autocratic than Russia. It
has its Siberias, in the hot lands of
the south; its spy system, its con
demnations for political offenses,
and its terrible prisons. The consti
tution is a dead document. It is a
government of the few for the few,
with a big standing army to back
them.
“These things can not be longer
concealed, as they have been, by sup
pression of individuals and journals.
Our large commercial interests and
the very closeness of the country it-
self make it necessary for us to
know the truth about Mexico.
“It is said that if the iron hand of
Diaz weakens, the state of affairs
will be worse than Cuba in ’9 7. We
should not sit in ignorance, for we
may have to step on the fuse. The
facts force their way to the light—
here and there. We have had inti
mations and knowledge of the true
inwardness of Mexico from many
sources.
“A great business man told us
that we would find conditions worse
than in Russia. A banker of Mexi
co disclosed remarkable personal ex
perience. A foreign journalist gave
us sidelights of curious import. A
manufacturer suggested a study of
graft in Mexico. There is surely a
spreading notion that something is
wrong in Mexico.
“Wny have we not known this be
fore? Diaz controls all sources of
news and the means of transmitting
it. Papers are suppressed or subsi
dized at the pleasure of the govern
ment.”—New York Dispatch to Cin
cinnati Enquirer.
FORT UN ATE FOREIGNERS.
“The money collected by benevo
lent persons in the United States for
foreign missions ‘runs yearly into
millions of dollars,’ but it is a mere
pittance in comparison with the dis
count made to foreigners who buy
our ‘protected’ wares. We sell them
tools from 20 to 100 per cent, less
than the prices exacted from home
purchasers. Saws are sold for export
at 40 per cent, reduction from do
mestic rates. We ‘put’ the screw’ to
home buyers of screws by asking
them 100 per cent, more than the
export price. And so it goes through
the whole range of protected man
ufactures. Os course the American
consumer should, in fairness, pay no
more for w r hat he buys than is de
manded of outside consumers; but
he can not help himself. He stag
gers along as best be can under the
weight of tariff exactions imposed by
act of Congress for the sole benefit
of the favored interests.” —Philadel-
phia Record.
POOR JOHN FITCH.
Man Who Invented First Steamboat
Forgotten in Fulton Celebration.
“Poor John Fitch!” Such is the
exclamation that ought to be upon
everybody’s lips during the week of
hilarious exaltation of Robert Ful
ton —who did not invent the steam
boat any more than did you or I.
This is at any time, a painful
theme; but coming to a period in
which one arctic explorer is rend
ing another for the reason that he
reached the north pole earlier, a
few pitiful memories of the man
who really applied steam to the pro
pulsion of boats is apropos. Every
New Yorker who passes up Center
street and recalls the Collect pond
that stood at the present site of the
Toombs ought to feel his eyes get
moist when he reads the gushing
glorification of Robert Fulton.
A steamboat was seen on the Col
lect pond years before the Clermont
was built.
Read the life of John Fitch in
Sparks’ “American Biography;”
learn the whole sad story from
O’Callaghan’s “Documentary History
of New York,” but especially study
Thompson Westcott's “Life of John
Fitch.” The latter book is memora
ble, and a reader never can forget
the facts set forth in opposition to
the claim of Robert Fulton.
The Century Dictionary of Names
barely mentions Fitch. There I
read: “An American inventor; born
at Windsor, Conn., January 21,
1743; committed suicide at Bards
town, Ky., July 2, 1798. He con
structed steamboats, the first of
which was launched on the Delaware
river in 1787.” Very brief and ut
terly unsympathetic—like the treat
ment Fitch received during his life!
The construction of the Clermont
was not begun until 1806, and her
trial trip began on August 11, 1807.
John Fitch conceived the idea of
applying steam to vessels about April
15, 1785. Prior to that time he had
applied it to carriages and had built
what was actually the first automo
bile the w T orld ever saw! His first
model of a steamboat was completed
in that year. In this model he placed
the wheels inside the hull and op
erated them through the bottom—
very much as a centerboard is used
on a sailing yacht of today.—Cham

PROTECTION OF WOMEN.
“Little Joe Brown of Georgia,” as
' he is affectionately dubbed, seems to
be small only in the matter of size.
Tom Watson says of him, in the
Jeffersonian; “Thank God, we have
found a man at last.”
But perhaps the best feature of the
case that has called forth this sweep
ing commendation of Governor Brown
lies in the fact that the position taken
by him means the protection of help
less women. In this Georgia has
taken the initiative, and it is devoutly
to be hoped all Southern States will
fall gallantly in her lead. —Will Allen
