FRIDAY, SEPT. t7, 1995.
The Populists of Concordia par
ish met at South Bend recently,
and organized. An executive com
mittee was elected, and after pass
ing several strong resolutions, ad
journed, subject to call.
-e-
A prominent Populist of this
city on being asked to return to
the I)emocratic fold, replied :
"Things are so mixed that if I 1
started back, I would not know
which road to travel."
Time-Sunday morning-Speak
ert, two. Said No. 1, "The Demo
crats are going to meet on the 23d.
Said No. 2. No-on the 26th.
Thus they argued, until a third
said, "Don't you know that the
gold Democrats meet on the 23rd,
and the silver Democrats meet on
the 26tb.
The Populist executive commit
tee of Caldwell parish recently
ordered a parish nominating con
vention for December 21st, for the
purpose of nomiating parish of
fieem. The delegates to this con- J
vention to be 'elected by ward
meetings. The Populists will car- I

The Louisiana Industrial School F

Tcenipc in a Teapot.
After blowiniig its horn for seve
ral weeks abult P'olulist records
in ('ongress, the Enterprise of last
week wasted half a column of its
valualde(:) space, showing that the
lPopulists voted against a certain
. tariff bill which was suppo~scd to
lower the tariff, and doubtless, like
all other I)Democrat ic tariff reforms,
oi did lower it on the products of la
b [or, and raise it higher on the pro
ducts of capital made in this coun
try.
} Now, we do not claim that the
i IPopulists voted right in every in
stance, though they (lid in this one,
but what we do claim is that they
o voted true to their platform, and
10 that the I)emocrats did not.
The space of the Enterprise
er therefore is thrown away in citing
any Populist votes on the tariff
question, because the word "tariff"
er cannot be found in their platform.
In this connection, if the lhemo
* cratic party is in favor of free
trade, or even a low tariff, we
s would be glad to have an explana
tion of Senators Caffrey and Blan
chard's refusal to vote for the Wil
son bill until it contained a protec
. tire tariff on sugar.
The Enterprise's charge about
some votes against free silver is so
I- indistinct, and so plorly quoted,
c- that we are unable to locate them,
I- and as we have no complete Con
gressional Record at hand, we have
referred the charge to the lion.
B Thos. E. Watson, one of the ac
o cused, and will print his reply.
We hope the Enterprise will
I keep up this investigation, as we
r may learn something by it, and we
are sure the Enterprise will.
From an article in last week's
- Enterprise we learn that they were
informed that two of the justices
recently nominated by the Popu
P lists in two country wards were
unable to read or write. We sup
pose they refer to Mr. Sanders, of
ward 7, and Mr. Poche, of ward 10.
In reply we will state that we have
seen several letters written by Mr.
Sanders, and that Mr. Poche wrote
and read in our presence. Their
informants head must be full of
buttermilk. The election of either
justice would be a marked improve
ment over several men for whose
present position your party is res
ponsible. The letters recently
printed in the Enterprise from
parties who could neither read,
write or spell, and to which we re
ferred to in the Populist, must
have struck in a sore place, hence
this groundless accusation about
our justices.
Mr. Poche's reason why he did
not want the office--we were pres
ent when he refused to accept, was
that he was too busy with other
affairs to devote his whole time and t
attentionea to it, and only after his I
nomination was insisted on did he
consent to make the race.
Show your informant this, andi
send him around for further par
ticulars.

We made a pleaesant trip to Col
fax ahst Monday, and spent Tues. (
day and part of Wednesday there. t
We met many old friends while a
there, some the schoolmates of our i
early childkthood days, and pleasant- c
ly we went with some of them over
the scenes of "just twenty years
agog"
It had been more than eleven
years since we had been in Colfax,
though never far away from it du
ring the time, and while the town I
bha-grown some sines then, there
were a few old land-marks that a
leeked familiar. Every one we
met had a kind word and a pleas- 3
ant smile for us, and we enjoyed a
our trip hugely. .

st editor ainolunced that he w oul I
ts speak at Forest Hill on Sa:lturh'lav.
Se"ieptenmllr 21st. .iving 4 weeks
in tie to circulate the appointment.
to O()n arrivin at Alexandria the
e dllay Ibfore our appojintment, we
,. learned that the frienlds of our
1- State admlinistration hadl ordered a
aIig hlarlbecle andl their hi_est
'- speakers to coyver onr appoint lent.
and therely ' get a larger cro'(w\'I
IW than they couldl holpe to 4et other
wise.
, laing the .amue keen de-ire to
' 1 talk to and convert I)lenerats that
41 they ought to have for Populists,
we were pleased at the ol1portuni
e t offeredl' and )proc1eeded41 to Forest
g Il ll.
f The )Democrat:s in this parish
have on sever:ll occasions been in
h deblted to the Pops for their crowd.
- but on such occasions they have
e never been so ungratefnl as to re
e fuse to divide timne with Populist
- speakers, so we never dreamed that
a the adunimstration l)emuocrats in
I Rapides were meaner than else
where.
But our wily U. S. Senator,
it Blanchard, fresh from Europe with
" his new lessons in finance, could
1, not stand even a piney-woods Pop
Sulist speaker to -'mix it" with him,
andt so the committee absolutely
e refused any division of time, and
a we were not permitted to speak,
even a few minutes, though it was
our al'l)intment, andi over half
the voters present were Pops.
e Now we should have pulled off
e our crowd and talked to them to
our hearts content, but we have
other resources for the Iaanufac
ture of Pops than our own chin
n music, and not least among them
are speeches made in suplport of
our present State or National ad
ministrations; anti again, a pretty
little fight was in motion between
Blanchard andl the free silver I)em
ocrats, and we love to see fur fly,
and we saw it fly.
lion. E. G. Hunter was the only
real silver representative allowed
to speak that day, and he was limi
r ted to one hour, and made to speak 1
first, while all the other speak
ers, including one rank goldhug,
(G. W. Bolton) were unlimited in
time or latitude. But the way C
Hunter used that one hour, was t
amazing. Iie took a vote on in- t
jecting silver into State politics, I
and nearly the whole crowd voted r
with him, and not one voted in the d
t negative.
When Hunter was called down, I
Blanchard looked like a sucked l
orange, or like the I)emocratic par- I
ty will look after he (B.) gets the t
silver question out of State poli
ties and the true Democrats out of
hs party. t
Blanchard tried for 3 hours to f
furnish a llausible excuse for his h
siDly and ruinous course, andl suc
ceeded in making more Populist ,
votes than we could have done in e
the same length of time.
We feel very much compliment- I
ed over Senator Blanchard's refu- e
sal to divide time with us, and we
are also very much pleased with I
his efforts to burst up the Demo
cratic party. I

Au~N, LA., Sept. 20, 1895. a
Editor Louisiana Populist:
Dear Sir and Friend-The Dem
ocratic Silver League speaker,
Hon. M. J. Cunningham, was at
Allen on the 17th inst., and was
met by ten or a dozen Pops. He
delivered asplendid address on free
silver, though he was somewhat
surprised to find other speakers on
the Popolist side of the house;
you humble servant, though no or
ator, gave them a short tal, and
was followed by Mr. D. iG. Free
man, of Red River, who made a
forcible speech in favor of Popu
lism. Hesaid that was his first -
attempt, and if he improves as he
dId to the next day, he will be heard
all over the country. it
The silver league man made no u
effort to organise at Allen or Bue- a
lab. I do not know what they *
did at Tanner's .school house, but (
old ward five is all right.
Yours for suoeess, ix
J. J. HORTZN. 0
A big free silver, barbecue and u
speaking was had at this place

ly our As-ociate will leave us to
edit it.
The Pops in old Ra:lides are wa
king up, and are iroinr to be heard
from in a sulbstantial way.
Senator Blanchard ha,., s opened
the campaign ill thlii State for Gov.
Foster. In his slee'(h at Forest
Hill last Saturday, h(e Iegged sit- 1
ver men not to draw the line on (
our present Executive, even though h
he might le a goldlhug. The Seln
ator's zoldhug friend, lion. G. W.
Bolton, followed in a harmonious .
speech that found no fault, of
course, with the Senator's.
Every gollbug in this town
heard with apparent relish his
(Sen. B.) free silver speech at the T
Courthouse here Monday. l lis
strictures on them were mlore than A
offset by his suPlport of Gov. Fos
ter, and his unique! plan of leaving
the silver qulestion out of State
politics. Verily, there are mllny
ways in which to choke a (log to
death, and one of thenl is on butter.
Sen. B's plan of harmonizing the
Democratic party by making the R
75,0C1o free silver men in it, sub
mit to the 25.(N) (his own estimate)
goldbugs, is rather original, and is
very fortunate for us poor devilish
Polxps who will kindly take care of
all the true (silver) I)emocrats that I
the doughty Senator is driving
from his party with his little gold o:
hatchet.
" he Populist executive commit- k
tee of Catahoula parish has order
ed a primary election for Monday,
November 14th, 1.95, to select a
parish ticket, which ticket will be
elected.
DERRY, LA., Sept. 22, 1S95.
Editor Louisiana Populist:
Dear Sir :-I see some of the
Democratic papers have leon blam
ing us for our ignorance, but it
should not do that, as it is wrong
to make sport of people's misfor
tune. We rot our ignorance under
Democratic rule; they will agree
with us on that question. We
know that the Democrats possess
all the brains, but while we know
this, we know that the brains of
the Democrats have ruined their
party, and we are afraid that it
would do our party the same way
if we wore to listen to them. He
judge their future by their past. b
So we expect to continue the howl
mig until better times come.
