A Safe Bet.
T.NN TA NNER.
It it a "ate let to make, you can risk a
new hat:
When you hear a man may "I'm an old
I)emoerat."
If yon ask what that is? this reply will
be hip.
"A Pewmbernt is a Democrt; that's what
a Demoernt is."
lie can't tell what it it. nor neither can
yon :
Iecanse a mas. of contradictions are
preented to view :
A hatch pntch of ideas which changes
each hour
To snit the place hunters who seek of
fice and power.
One say-. 'I wart tariff," one to free
trade is joined
One cries for "'free silver," another.
"gold c.nly be coined;"
Fome want ,ilvcr and gold, and national
hanks.
All hiithed to the wagon-a strange
mixture of cranks.
Snap Shots.
The Democratic party needs a
good many things in its make up
to--again control the masses.
1st. It need(s men at the head
of it who can keep faith with the
people.
2nd. Its principles should al
ways be clearly expressed, with
out ambiguity and with no inten
tion of deceit. It needs fewer of
so-called principles, and more
brains. It needs honor. statesman
ship, virtue, truth and strict jus
tice in everything tending to the
welfare of the people.
It needs fewer liars and promise
breakers. In fact, it needs bury
ing so deep that nothing can ever
. dig up its skeleton.
The Republican party planted
the seed which brought into life
all the evils now visited upon the
agriculturalists. The Democratic
larty lent their iid in the cultiva
tion of and giving vigor to the
evils implanted by the Republi
cans. The man who changes from
one to the other, has simply doffed
the name and changed masters
without receiving any benefit.
Well street, New York, and Lom
bard street London, jews and bank
ers smile and whisper one to the
other: "It mikes no difference to
us, our servants will rule any
way."
Eadorsiag "Clevelsad and the
administration" is, a part of the
programm laid oat for so-called
inemocratie (1) conventions and
gatherings. It is a bitter dose for
the rank and file, but the conscien
tious gim rds of old party backs
are so used to digesting all kinds
of carrion that it does not in the
least set them back when pulling
string. to keep the party followers
