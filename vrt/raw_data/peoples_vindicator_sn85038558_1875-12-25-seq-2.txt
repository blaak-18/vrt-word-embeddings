Often of late days, daily almost,
we see some shocking account of a I'
want of regard for Gods laws in the N
matter of matrimony. Men live hon- U
ored and respected, and when death's fi
rites are over and wills are probated tl
tto three and as high as nine wives, re
with a gastly array of responsibilities is
large and small. Ward, of Michigan, a
dies, an t the young Wards and Mrs. ti
W\alds spring up by the dozen. Sin- g
ger ceases to warble and his little p
birds come out with several old fe- a
male Singers. Shields dies and with- v
draws the protectio lie afforded to f
two wives and nine small Shields o
from the gaze of the world. t
Our leading northern- cotemporaries d
seem horrified at this want of regard t
for the main fomndation to society, 'I
the sacredness of the marriage rites, '
but to us the nmtter is not strange at c
all. The very atmosphere of the a
North breeds this pestilence ; it is the a
natural home of all Ithoe isms, its 31
soil gives fortth the muiasma of mor- A
monism, fieeloveism, Bleecherism, I
and a hundred other dirty ismus, and I
these things have been allowed to
take their course without protest;
been looked upon as a criosity, a I
phase of Americanism, until they
have takeit deep root and pervade 1
society there froin top to bottom. 1
They seem to have become with vice,
"Familiar with her face
To first endure, then pity, then embrace "
Beacher is defended amid all
the accumulated and damning ev
idence of guilt ; the conduct of Sin
ger, Shield and Ward, ate spoken of
as a wonder and laughed at ; but no
moral is pointed ; no attempt is made
to show to society the great curse of
such conduct and after a little seven
day spasmodic eye-opening, society
s!eeps again and the crime against
God goes on. The fact is, that the
Northern people have been so much
in the habit of going outside of writ
ten constitutions and law to accom
plish what they/ desire that God's
word is no more to them than so much
paper. A time will come, bowever,
when this point cannot be carried suc
cessfully. When Beecher and such
men, no matter how much influence,
the world (1) or their part of it, may
say they have, must be judged by
One who will allow no appeal or
hung jury.
As far as we are concened we claim
nothing, but we care a great deal.
The radical people, and we can name
them when called upon, nor do they
enumerate more than one, insist that
all the virtue, if there be any, and we
are prepared to doubt it, of the re
duction of taxation from 8 per cent
Sto 14* mills in this parish, is a work of
theirs. Well-well, well that is, ac
Scording to the old man the d- ahl ;
Swe came near forgetting ourselves.
s The Radicals reduce tasxee! It is
Slaughable The Natchitoches Re
- publica' claiming it. It is snuart, not
9, so smart as to catch any one. We
1 happen to know the man (Y) who
r wrote up that claim, and ye Gods I
Swhat a man. To the white people it
is enoungh to know that they claim all
this GOOD work; they will know how
to do it themselves next time.
But it does seem strange that men
being of the radical party, should
Sdeem all men outside that party, fools.
It is easily seen, and seen so easily,
I that it seems the game schould not be
attempted.
Personal merit ought certainly be
the guage to judge all men by; if
Smerit is not known, certainly person
i al action should be taken as a strict
o criterion. We fail to remember when
n any '.an now connected with the rad"
ical office here ever claimed commen
* dation from the VWHITE people for
it either.

Tin CITY CHAaTER.--There has
been some misunderstanding with re
atrd to thm charter of the City of
I iatchitoches as passed in 1871. The
city property was exempted by that
act from ardinary pauish taxes only.
The tax-payere were required to, and
h did pay, the special taxes whenever
livied. In the event of the railreid
thx being levied, the city would be
Scompelled to pay its proportion of the
t parish railroad tax even if the city
le save bonds for stock also. In the
e litter event the city would have to
Spay alone the city tax for the rail
.e rad vaide by the perish. We will
rply at length next week to our
friend, "a planter," and give our
Sviews upon this city tar mitter akI
well as thie railroad.

Natchitoches, will give a GRAND) n
BENEVOLENT FAIR for the hene- of
fit of the MALE HIGH SCHOOL in pi
this plnce. From donations already vi
received, nd the many others pronl- hI
iced, this F.ui, promises to be a great or
success, and will be one of those ia
things seen once in a life time! The sli
gratuitous contributions for the sup- bI
per are munificent, and the ladies p1
will he able to offer a bill of fore so at
varied as to suit the taste of tile most of
fastidious, and all for the small sum w
of fifty cents ! It is therefore hoped in
that our country friends will not be de
deterred from coming and lending a4
their pretsence to this noble cause. pl
The time and money so expended to
will not he thrown away, for every oi
cent will be dedicated to the erection bi
and mlintainence of this High School, ni
a need long felt in our community, k
and for which we should all feel an d
anxious solicitrd.'. Let not cloudy or
inclement weather keep you at home,
I for once in the imagniicent saloon,
you cnn then remain until the weath- r,
er is suitable to go home in. This is q
Sthe only occasion we have had in b
r years for a general meeting of all the a
e people from the valious parts of the n
parish, and it cannot fail to be inter- Il
, esting and amusing, and those who let I
the opportunity pass without availihg
themselves of it, will have a tife long
regret. Every convenience will be
afforded those coming from a distance,
and lodgings prepared to receive I
'f them.
Now is the time to awake and doff t

ROADSIDE, Dec., 20th, 1875.
Dear Vindicator : 1
' Will you indulge me in asking you
1a few practical questions? While
ie your valuable paper has been enga
Y ged in exposing the many enormities
b imposed on the taxpayers, and calling
' loudly for reform, both in Parish and
State government; would it not be
proper to inform the taxpayer on the
Sfollowing questions Viz: list. Is
the Natchitoches City Charter of 1871,
still in force; or the legal Charter of
the City 2 Snd. How will the propo
sed Railroad tax effect the real estate
owner of the City, and if Ihe will be
entitled to vote for or against the
Stax, if carried, be snbjWet to tilhe
SRailroad tax-in as mtch as their
property of the City is exempted from
t the payment of parish tax, by special
I provision in thalt Chartert 3rd. Do
w the property-owners of the City in
tend to avail themselves of that spe
" cial provision in their Charter? If
Id so, tihe taxpayers should know it; if
, they do not wish to avail themselves
i of it, they should at once sign a pe
e tition to the Legislature for its imnme
diate repeal. I fear your silence on
1 this subject has been misconstrued ,by
many, but you having been so faith
Sful in exposing the many wrongs irm
t posed on thile taxpayers, cannot fail to
Scondemn tlls special privilege given
to the property-owners of the City
Sof Natclhitoches.
Or Hoping you will give your views
in your next paper, I remain as ever.

The Convention,

nounced and emphatic in expression si;
of views relating to our past and nr
present condition. But a short time nn
will elapse before we will be in the tai
helat of a campaign, potent of good the
or evil, for the people of the State at le
large, and no narrow minded action wt
should be taken, but a well defined, w,
broad and liberal platform of princi- vi
ples be enunciated-manking virtue fi
and intelligence the test and merits w
of official preferment. We know full ed
well that our enemies expect to make
much capital out of what might be 0<

assured this "might" will not take co
place. We have too much at stake; sh
too much intelligence to blunder now ti,

be fatal. January 6th, is the day set so
upon for this Convention, and we cc

question to the people, as required p

On motion L. G. arron. b'
: Be it Resolved by the Police Jury p
of the Parish of Natchitoches, State
ot Louisiana, That in view of the
rresent financial condition of this ik
e Parish and of the country, and believ- it
ing as this Body do, that the people, tl
[ and especially the mass of the pro
perty holders are opposed to any in- n'
crease of taxation, (even for such a si
cause as the one presented,) at this
e time. si
o Therefore it would be unwise, im
o politic and contrary to the wishes of a
majority of the property holders of ci
the parish, to aid the New Orleans o
and Pacific Railroad Company, on ti
the part of this Patlish, by snscrib
r ing to the capital stock of said com
pany, the sum of $100,000, payable it
n in annual installments of $10,000, for o
the period of ten years, to be paid by I
special tax on the property of real es
P tate owners for ia period of ten years. a
Be it further resolved, etc., That e
this Body desiring the welfare and c
,S happiness of the citizens of this par
t ish, being earnest and desirous of
their increasing prosperty, and to t
lighten the burden of their taxation, v
respectfully decline to entertain at tl
the present time, the petition, memo
rial and resolutions made by citizens
u to this Body, to make such subscrip- a
e tions, and to submit the question to t

Iayad'd's Remarks oil is-ls
sippi. th<
Mr. Morton, calling up his Missis
sippi resolution, said he had a large
number of documents, written by a
number of persons in Mississippi de
tailing the circumnstaices attending 11
the recent election. The statement
lhe'proposed to lay before the Senate
was not of his own knowledge, but
was received from others. lie re
viewed the election in Mississippi as
fair back as 18(9. The last election of
was 34,000 higher than any vote poll- Ri
ed. 1d
The Demosratic vote in 1875 was
96,8(16, against 44,216 in 1873. The
Republican vote fell off, but not in a
corresponding ratio, le read letters is
showing intimidation in several coun
ties.
Mr. Bayard said this resolution,l1
so far as he knew, was without a pre
cedent in the Senate, and lie would l
like to inquire of the Senator fromn
Indiana (Morton) under what clause
of the Constitution of the United of
States he found authority to make the
inquiry in a case of this kind.
Mr. Morton said lie did not pro
pose now to go into a constitutional a
argument upon this question. He o
had ony to say that it had been de
cided heretofore as in the Louisiana su
case, besides the enforcement act had gl
been violated in Mississippi, and the
blow had fallen upon the colored peo- n
ple, as it was intended to.
Mr. Hayard denied that the Louis- u
Stai case was similar to this; that at
investigation was under a clause of of
the Constitution which made the Sen tli
ate the sole judge of the claims for er
i seats in that body. ti.
If law had been violated in Missis- pt
sippi the courts were open, and this IP
was a government of laws- those i
f courts were open for the indictment ki
a of oflfenders, and for damages against m
I those who wronged others. In those a
courts the remedy was to be found ;
e it could not be said that the political ti
r or party friends of the Senator from as
Indiana in Mississippi had not a full t
and equal chance before the law eith- as
t er in the United States or State
courts.
The officers all over the State, from ci
the Governor down to the constable,
, were of the Senator's party, and if ci
t they could not punish violators of law,
it was a sad confession for the Sen- m
ator from Mississippi to make. When
o the new Senator from Mississippi
came here with his credentials, if
there were grounds that lie was not P
qualified, then the Senate could sit
as judges, but until that time, no
action could ie taken. When be
- .re in the history of this country d
did the Senate of the United States
propose to take testimony in regard
to the election of members of the a
C other House of Congress as this res
olntion proposed to do ?
e The Constitution provides that
endach House shall be the judge of the
qualifications of its own members.
The Governor of Mississippi asked for a
o Federal troops before the election to
keep the people of that State in awe.
d Thd'correspoudence between him and
the head of the Department of Justice
' was known to all. Gov. Ames failed
a to show that any cause existed for I
e Federal interference.
s, Mr. Bayard then referred to the late
it message of the President, and said s
e there was not one word in it about I
, Southerti affairs. The Department of
4. Justice had its agents down there, t
gathering information for the guid- 0
ance of that department. There was '
a not one word or suggestion as to
these alleged wrongs. If these things j
existed there, it was remarkable that z
the President of the United States I
maintained a dead silence on the sub
Sject.
S All this matter came from the Sen-.
1I ator from Indiana, who always seem
be ed to have in his possession statements
i, hostile toward the peace of the South
-. ern States--some assertions without
character against the whole people of a
that coun)ry. This was a revolution- a
Di ary propositi6n. It was but another
s- itep in the march toward the conso
s lidation of power, which the people
r. of this country must see.
This was the flrst time that the
Senate of the United States sought
to take testimony concerning the elec
tion ofmembers in the other House a
SofCongress. At the time lthese South- g
Sera people were helpless and bleed. i
ing at the foot of the Senator from
Indiana and his party, the Senators I
of his (Bayard's) side asked when the i
time was to come that the Southe'rn (
T( States could be rebabited. The eon.
t ator from Indiana (Morton) was asked
then what warrant he found in the
Constitution for his action? He
could give no answer.
,, When asked if he would interfere
e. with Louisiana or Mississippi any
more than be would with New Jer
sey or New York ? He answered we
rs claim the right to deal with these
of Southern States.
S In the Senator's own State (Indiana)
id there has been a great change in the
popular vote recently.
Mr. Morton said "Yes, andl there
of might be a change in the popular vote
of the Senator's State l (Delaware)
e, Bayard-Yes, sir; but if my peo.
ple express their ballot against me at
the ballot-box, I will not come here
to ask the Senate to revolutionize my
oanntry. [Applause in thire galleries.]
The Vice-President announced, if
the demonstration was repeated, he
would direct the Sergeant-at Arms to D4
clear the galleries.
Mr. Bayard, resuming, said the «(
Senate, by giving assent to the pro
position ofthe Senator from Indiana,
would declare that elections in States ap
were to be judged by the Senates of lo,
the States. lal
OBITUARY. ho
Died in the City of Urbana, State rmi
of Ohio, on the 7th inst.. Mrs. MAnY So
RYAN, aged 76 years, sister of the
late Judge Boyce, and of Michael 'e
Boyce.
It becomes our painful duty to an.
nounce the death of Mrs. Mary Ryan, no
one of our most estimable and cher- E3
ished citirzens. She died in that city, Hi
on Tnesday, after a very short but bu
painful illness. The deceased was
the relic of the late Christopher Ryan, an
who died there several years ago. are
Mrs. Ryan was 7G years old and for ge
the last fifty years has been a resident pa
of Urbana. For a woman of her on
years she was remarkably well pre- en
served, and continued in full posses- oil
sion of all those faculties with which "w
a useful life is endowed. Her death m
was not a consequence of age, but
the result of an acute illness. The
sudden death, therefore, spreads a
gloom over our entire community. ,
She was a lady distinguished for ma- 1
ny excellent qualities of head and hX
heart which drew around her the WI
warm and lasting affection of friends x
and neighbors. The cherished rule th
of her life was justice, and aiming at re
this, she brought to bear a faithful j"
energy and a zealous christian deveo
tion. Wherever duty called she was dt
prompt to respond, and her inspiring of
presence never failed to be the har- P1
binger of good. Her many acts of Pý
kindness, and charity will keep her I

Mrs. Ryan was a woman of educa- di
tion and refinement and will be sadly
and mournfully missed in our society, ti
to which she added the charms and
accomplishments of a cultivated life. t
A well spent life was hers, rich in all it
those good deeds which brighten and o
embelish the christian character C
Rarely has a death occurred in that o
city which has stricken so many
hearts with grief as the announce
meat we make in this notice. Mrs.
Ryan has passed away, but her cher- a
ished virtues and noble deeds will t!
linger in the recollections of those
t people while time lasts.
The deceased was a sister of the a
late lion. Henry Boyce, Judge of the S
Circuit Court of the United States for '
the State of Lonisiana, under Presi
dent Tylor. She leaves three daugh- 4

a kind and indulgent mother.
Explosion of the Steamboat C.
H. Durfee.
-t 5
On Saturday evening last, the a
steamboat C. A. Durfee, Captain R.
Sinnott, left the eity with a fair trip
r of freight and a large number of pas
a sengers, including a detachment of
U. States troops on deck, bound for e
Alexandria. When about thirteen t
miles above the city the starboard
e steam pipe of her engine exploded.
d The escaping of the steam immediate
r ly killed one of the crew, who, attle th
time, was sleeping in his bank, and
the hot water scalded three of the
e crew and four of the soldiers. For f
d some time the greatest excitement a
t I prevailed among the crew and pas
4 sengers, and it was only the presence
of mind and firm bearing of the cap.
r tain that prevented all from jamping a
I- over into the river. The men who I
• were scalded and saved are at pre
sent doing remarkably well, their in
juries only being of a slight nature.
SThe freight and passengers were
t transeterred to the steamboat Bonnie
, Lee, which was coming up behind the
)Darfee when the accident occurred.
The Darfee immediately returned to
New Orleans, arriving here at 2 P. M.
- Sunday. The damage done the boat
by the explosion is slight, and she
will be ready in a few days to resume
her trade.-N. O. ,Repubiac.

n Yes, it is lovel, to contemplate the
fact that the tax-payer is no longer

that he has no one to thank for that
