THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE,
AND A FEW LACONICS

FIVE THOUSAND HUNGRY CHIL
DREN AT CHICAGO’S PUB
LIC SCHOOLS.
It may possibly amaze some good
people, who have wept copiously at
the (printed) conditions of foreign
lands, to learn that a school census of
Chicago showed that 5,000 children
attended the public schools there,
who had gone to school daily for
months without a morsel of food.
White babies are SOLD in Chicago
for from $1 to $3 apiece!
Reads nice, doesn’t it, for a coun
try that is sending millions of dol
lars a year to foreign countries to
care for people who could be cared
for by their own.
The thinking man and woman
should realize this; under the very
liberal immigration laws of the Uni
ted States, as many of the unregen
erate who can are coming from
other countries. The word “heath
en” isn’t applicable only to the
African jungle dweller, nor the
Chinese idol worshipper, nor the Mo
hamedan; “by and large” they have
a working basis of religion which
does them very well; they don’t let
their children go hungry, as a rule,
nor do they speed so madly after the
money of their particular realm as
to make them forget to spend some
of it for family needs.
After the average immigrant
reaches this country he, she and it,
collectively, grow desperately home
sick.
The rabbit-like modes of living
thrust upon them by American ways
and methods, strengthens the long
ing for the old home, and the watch
word of the family is “save.”
Every dollar is hoarded; every
charitable institution which will give,
is importuned to give, and we have
a splendid near view of the greed
which prompts neglect, just as we
read of its operation in China, India,
Japan and other countries where mis
sion workers are so generous with
other people’s money.
If a last analysis was made of the
true condition of the children of
Chicago, New York, Philadelphia
and Pittsburg, who go breakfastless
to school, it’s a twenty to one shot
it would be found, first: they were
the children of foreigners; second,
their parents were employed regu
larly at some trade or calling which
was at least sufficiently paid to pro
vide the family with food, and, third,
that these parents were willing for
their children to be fed by the chari
tably inclined, just as they are will
ing to accept everything else that is
offered them.
If the plan of mission workers was
based on a working knowledge of
conditions existing in every city in
the United States, there would be
few hungry children at public
schools, and fewer babies sold at
from $1 <to $3 apiece.
THE PROBLEM OF THE CITIES.
The number of felonius homicides
per year per million population for
various countries follow: Canada, 3:
Germany, 4 to 5; England and Wales,
10 to 11; France, 12 to 15; Belgium,
15; United States, over 129. These
figures are based on an average taken
for eight years.—Dr. Andrew D.
White.
When the taxpayers of the United
States are confronted with figures
like those, it is time they sat up and
did some thinking.
Another interesting set of figures
might also be prepared, showing the
cost of living in each of these coun
tries named, and again the United
States would lead as highest.
For every condition there is a rea
son. We find the cost of living in
large cities constantly on the increase.
Rents, food, clothing, all are ad
vancing, and with the population
growing denser, the cost increases,
while wages remain stationary.
The criminal percentage of Italy
is not given in the above table, but it
would also show a record greatly be
low that of the United States, and
would compare with France and Bel
gium.
The benign and beneficent govern
ments of those countries with the
low criminal records have a, and to
them, satisfactory, way of shipping
their criminals to these United Sthtes.
And that puts this country in bad.
The charitable institutions, the penal
institutions, public hospitals, orphan
asylums and dispensaries of every
large city in the United States con
tain inmates made up of three
fourths foreign and only one-fourth
of American birth and parentage.
These inmates may be traced with
little trouble to the criminal and pau
per classes of Europe, the off-sweep
of Asia and the dregs of Africa.
Plan our immigration laws never
so wisely, the plans for breaking or
evading them are successfully carried
out.
We need, first, a stricter enforce
ment of our immigration laws; and
for every foreigner convicted of crime
within a certain time after his ar
rival in this country, we need a law
which will make it possible to send
him back to his native land.
As long as the United States per
mits itself to be the sink for the
dumping of the criminal and pauper
classes of foreign countries, so long
will she remain at the head of the
list when statistics are made of
crime percentage.

is a long way from being an also ran.

A newspaper says “it always pays

Atlanta Baptists give two cents

Oh, well, that’ll help to buy stamps,

It’s a foregone conclusion that the

The investigation now being made
into the social affairs of the “naval

cles.
An editorial asks, “Can the
American hen be trusted?” Sure —
she can be trusted to stop laying
when eggs go up to umpty-steen
cents a dozen.

One preacher is attacking actors
and actresses, another is objecting to

South Carolina farmers were once
the heaviest buyers of Western hay;
they are now the largest producers of

All of Tammany’s resources are
not yet tied up, judging rfom the dis

The officials of the Big Four road
are probably evincing a little interest
in just how much money they would
have made if their ex-treasurer
hadn’t had such expensive and ex
acting “lady friends.”

With eggs at thirty-five cents a
dozen and chickens too scarce to be
easily recognized as a food, doesn’t
it jar you to read of a man valuing
one hen at SIO,OOO and her eggs at
SSO per each?

Mr. Pinchot is realizing how very

Space is so scarce in New York
they can’t even afford to store eggs
in their shells. The eggs were
broken, put in vessels and kept in
cold storage, when their trade name
was “liquid eggs.”

It has taken a long time for wo
men to be recognized in some lines,
but when it comes to courts-martial,
“an’ sich,” they show up strong, as
witness the one held recently in
Boston’s navy yard.
We always have heard that Cali
fornia men were a hardy lot, but the
prize should be given to the Romano
Critschoof; he’s dead, but it was
only after firing eleven bullets into
his brain and then hanging himself
that he “went dead.”
When the farmer will raise all he
needs for himself, and sell for cash
all that the other fellow doesn’t
raise, but has to have, he will feel
little personal effect from the sky
prices of beef, butter, hay, wheat
and other necessities.
Ail the “breakfast food” manu
facturers are going to combine, and
this means there will soon be a pre
mium on sawdust, corn cobs and pea
nut shells, as the average “breakfast
food” seems to have these as founda
tions.
Evidently the Chinese are not the
only people who are willing to eat
antique food. In a cold-storage
warehouse in New York it was found
that 36,000,000 eggs had been stored
last March. They will probably be
offered for sale at Easter-time this
year as “strictly fresh”. Fancy the
feelings of the hens who laid those
eggs, could they learn of the chilly
reception their offspring have been
the victims of.
