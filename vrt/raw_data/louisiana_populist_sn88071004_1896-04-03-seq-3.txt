mcracy. I even pointed out the
fact that four yeuri ago you were
a candidate for District Attorney
on the Democratic Ticket. and al
though you wer.+ horribly snowed
under. I emphatically denied the in
sinuation that you left the Demo
cratic party because you could not
get an osce. I further insisted
that-the most striking evidence of i'
your originality in everythinr, and it
especially in politics, was the fact, e;
• hat four years ego, when you:I
were a candidate for District At
torney of a faction of the Demo
cratic party, your opponent for r
that rosition offered to suhmit m
your respective claims to a white ti
primary, and you refused, yet they ti
say you. are trying. to get upsa to
cheap notoriety by now asking the B
Democratic party to do the same
thing, and because Mr. Porter act- n
ing for the party and under their 11
instructions, answerel your request b
so ably, so clearly, so logically ti
and so conclusively, that you were
afraid to publish his reply. AI'
of this 'ear brother-in-law, I point
ed out as absolute nroof of your e
great orig;nality. I insisted that ti
yo:ir record in p litics absolutely a
established your indisputable right e
to the proud title of the most "ori- d
inal" man in politics. But all I
could say on this subject did not
seem to convince "the boys." They I
admitted the facts mentioned, but a
still insisted that you were a small d
and weak copy of Jimmy C ,sgrove t
and Charley Puckett. Now this
S(lid vex me sure, I g,it so mad dear
brother-in-law, I actually shed
tears. The idea that any one Y
Sshould secuse anvhoddy so dear to a
me as you. of apeing and imitating f
Jimmy Cosgrove and Charley ,
Purkett in politics, just rilel me t
terribly.
But the only consolation you I
.have is, that it s the penalty of
r reataess to be traduced and belit- t
tied. So 1 say, dear brother-in
'aw, don't notice these mean things,
you just go on be'ng "original" I
and you'll be a pride and an orna
Sment to your family aad friends.
Now I lett these people, and
showedl your letter to some other I
friends of yours, and they said "P. i
P." stood for "Peanut Politicians,"
S1. of eoure, denied this imputa
tion on your well established renu- a
tation as an eminent and able i
statesman. But they said, that |
I last week two or three days betore
Syoue wrote me this: letter, you hlad '
already written up and submitted i
to the Ohairman of the Democratic a
- party, an agrement for the ap
Spolatmet of Commiuialoner of
t eleetion. that took the matter en
tirlry out of the hands of the board =
of SupervIsor", and that year let
t.r to me was either an met of sunp
permnutloti, or a desire to humaing
the Clmirman of the Democratic
r Exeueative Committee. or to huban- 1
r bug me. But I told them they
r mat be mistaken that I knew you
loved me too amch to try to hum- 1
bg me, sad I didn't believe you
would try to humbag anybody.
But they saIk you would, and dark- I
ly Insinuated that there was a row e
I samng the "Penats" an aceount of1

Dear U. Peter :-Your affection- (ar

is true you say nothing about giv- of
ing tie Populist party coamnission for

sacrificed public welfare for my of
good ; you have acknowledged our nat
relationship. It has always been yes
my highest ambition to get U. Pe- the
ier to be down on recol d as a rela
tive. You know you a'e a brothe in
to the famous Col. Phanor Pierre
Brezeale, and nephew to the re- res
nowned Major William Overton pr

Louisiana, now being an acknowl
edgesl relative of U. Peter, I hope ree
t the good people of Natchitoches thi
will not give the name Breazeale ele
everything, but consi.ler it their
duty to pass something my way. ed
t Now U. Peter, your good friend
Blanchard, provided for you tor a thb
t while, you were until recently a Sd
I door-keeper to some side alley in pC
the Capitol at Washington, your at
exact peltionlI cannot mention, of
S(Indies read this paper) however, lar
I you became restless, and being de
sirous to imitate your Senator ha

Syou camre to the iprish of Natchi- to
P toches anid amused the good peo- thi
Sple by entering the race first for or
f Senator, and next for Represeanta- oh
- tive, well U. Peter, you ca ried ad
- out the usual Brezeale propensity a
, of grabbing for everything in sight, the
Sbut al:s, your light weight would tb
not permit you to land in anything. ch
I Howover, U. Peter, do not dis
r pair, your position in Washington
,, is open.
U. Peter, your hits at O'YMalley
.and Cosgrove and Puckette, they e
e must and will answer for them- pr
t selves. In regard to my ran ing ph
Sa various times for office, I have to

Now U. Peter, I must close, 1 Ti
f would like to tell you how much I
I appreclate your letter, bow dear li
S-lyou are to my hea-t a'idl how sorry pt
' I am that you did not land on Ben- u.
star or Repreontative, but had t
Sbhe content with taking an eo "e
y where it was your duty to count in
u all aour relatives, and see yourself
left.
U Say, U. Peter, to be erous, I
. do not like your being Balerv sor
r of election, it is the frst eas on
frecord when a Breaseale held an
office where the labor was greater m
Sthan the salary. I, ass reeognised !
