OLD JACK IS DEAD
He Was not a Dog of High Degree lint
a Good Dog.
After a long, useful and exemplary
career, Old Jack, yielding to the in
firmities of old age, lay on a bed of new
straw, spread beneath a desk in the of
fice of his master and friend. WV. W.
Waring, awaiting, intuitively, the sum
mon through which he would be trans
ferred from this "vale of tears" to '
realm where dogs may feast on bones
thrown to them and where they may eat
their heat, rare or done-up brown, with
out the fear or the apprehension of
stones or bricks being hurled by
naughty boys and meaner men, or ti'i
cans tied by the merciless who become
gleeful over the howls, the barks ar- 1
the strides of terrified curs. If dogs
could only talk what a tale they
would unfold from the rattling can
tacked to their tail of woe! But dig;
are speechless, and it is a pity that some
beings are not dogs in that respect! Z
It was on Saturday. April 25, ioo'
when Jack was pulseless, ready to have
his "toes turned up to the daisi:.s.
Jack "first saw the light of day" in the
year %. D. t888. when the opera h usc
was being constructed, and during his
perambulations he never failed to at
tend the Baptist church choir, of which
his master and friend is a member, and
it is to his record that he, in his dog
way, sympathized with the mourners at
about one thousand funerals at which
his master officiated. Although Jnk's
genealogy could not be traced to the
days of Adam and Eve, Jack was no oe
dinary dog. There was nothing of the
cur about him. He was a gentlemai's
dog and through his manners indicat
ing his training and good breeding he
commanded the respect and admiration
of good as well as mischievous boys.
He had his peculiarities, as have some
men, but it could not be said that he
was "cranky." or had "wheels in his
head." He seemed gifted with an intel
lect discriminating in the intensity of
sensibility. While he would never for
give an enemy-one who had been un
kind or had treated him harshly-he
never forgot a friend, on meeting whom
he would manifest his rejoicing with a
gleeful bark and the wagging of his
tail, the wagging of which was in
creased with his barks when some ad
mirers, a commercial traveler for in
stance, would pat him and pet him and
say "meat, Jack, meat," and go with
him to the butcher shop around the
corner. It may be said of Jack as an op
posite trait, that when a naughty boy
would worry- him beyond all bounds he
had a ,way of retaliating by seizing the
boy by the sitting part of his breeches
and hanging thereto until there was a
rip and tear and Jack's mouth was full
of pants from a running, panting almost
pantsless boy.
jack was conservative ana aisn
clined to fight, and as some men, he
would if he could avoid unpleasant en
tanglements, but when the issue was
forced upon him he never hesitated by
seizing the opposition or seek a com
promise, but was quick, fierce and decis
ive in execution. In his 4og-way he had
realized the futility of temporizing with
an enemy with a view of placating him,
and maintainsl iiis dignity and self
respect as well as his successes and his
triumphs by adhering strictly to the line
of duty. In his dog-way, principle xvas a
guide which fortinid him against all
misleadings by the most tempting of
meatful bones. As Jack was no ordinary
dog, he has seceived unusual attention,
a mark of distinction which falls to the
few, unless they be millionaires. Very
few indeed of the great number who
struggle unceasingly -for existence in
this big, round world. Jack was em
balmed and laid out in a metallic casket
at the establishment of his master and
friend, where the faithful good, old
dog may be viewed in `ate. awaiting1
the time, in the near future: when he
will be put awai.- from mortal sighi for
ever.
If all men were only as dogs in
their ftiendships and their loyalty! In
the old story of "Poor Dog Tray?
which may be applied to Jack, there is
much of the truthfully pathetic from
which a strong lesson may be drawn
in sermonizing.
A COTTON FIRE.
Compress at Arcadia Destroyed Friday
Afternoon.
The Levy Compress at Arcadia with
about Itoo bales of cotton were de
stroyed by fire Friday afternoon. The
fire spread rapidly. Arnold Haley, a
colored laborer, was fatally injured.
The superintendent, Captain Will Mil
ler, had a narrow escape. The bulk of
the cotton was owned by C. M. Barn
well & Co., of Shreveport, and Herman
Loeb had about 5o bales of cotton de
stroyed. The losses are partly covered
by insswance.

TROOPS
During the Sige-Remnants of the
Long Ago-A Remarkable In:
dent-Veterans Visiting.
The generations of today have little
knowledge of Vicksburg, Miss., in the
historical struggle between the North
and the South. which has challenged
the admiration of the world. It \:xs
forty years ago when grey header; men
now where beardless boys then. ý,ith
stood the siege of the army four to one
under Grant supported by a powerful
fleet of gunboats, starved into st.bmis
sion as gallant a body of men as ever
faced the enemy in defense of princi
ples and their country. It was not until
this band of men, a hopeless nmin rity
against .the Federal hordes equipp°.1
with the best arms of the day, srrtin
dered when almost starved and reduced
in fighting numbers in a sense to a cor
poral's guard, that Grant became the
master of Vicksburg. In this historic
struggle, as in every conflict through
out the campaigns conducted under
Lee and Jackson in Virginia, in Mary
land and in Pennsylvania, and under
Albert Sidney Johnston and Beaure
gard, Bragg, Joe Johnson and Hood in
the thrilling campaigns in Ken'uck.'.
Tennessee and Georgia, the Louisia-'n
troops bore their part conspicuously.
The Louisiana brigades in Virginia
were talismen of victory or desperate
resistance, and the Louisiana briiea.es
in the army of Tennessee has a reed
for persistent and untiring soldiery an]
heroic fighting never surpassed in the
history of warfare.
One afternoon when Hood was en
route to Nashville. Tenn., aft-r th.ý
Louisiana brigade, supported by more
than one hundred pieces of artillery
belching destruction and carnage in
every direction, had crossed the T:n
nessee river, General Stephen U. L%
and a few of his staff rode to the bark
of the river and inquired anxiously of
the captain in the last pontoon hoit
who were these troops crossing, and
the captain replied that it was the
Louisiana brigade. General Stephen t.
Lee smiled approvingly and remarked
"We are safe," and rode away. And no
sooner were they on the other s;.e
than they were in action and drov the
enemy away and sustained their posi
I tion until reinforced and the pontoon
bridges had been laid over the river on
which the army of Tennessee ccosed'
before the next day.
During the siege of Vicksburg tIe
Louisiana troops were conspicuo-ii for
their gallantry under the most t".,tig I
ordeals, and it is gratifying to note that
among the number selected by Gov
ernor Heard to locate the positions ac I
cupied by the Louisians regiments were
included on the board Captain i. B.
McCutchen and F. A. Hilley of Shreve
port. who have returned horde after
spending several days in the histori,

One of the remarakble incidents
was the recovery by Captain McCutch
en o fa piece of shell and a mipie bul
let which he had buried in a spot' which
he described before reaching it and
which recalled the fact that at the time
Colonel L. D. Marks had been struck
by this piece of shell and Major A. S.
Norwood was wounded by the minie
ball which fell to th1e ground. These
trophies of the long ago were brought
home by Captain McCutchen.

in Virginia and in Tennessee were not

count for this transformation, but who

a snowball fight with the Tennessee
brigade, who were "flanked" and
driven from the field. On returning to
their camp the Louisianians were well
provided and the Tennesseans were
left to wonder how it all happened.

been well done and in the location of
