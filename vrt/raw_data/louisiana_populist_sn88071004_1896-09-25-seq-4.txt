The Patriot and the Anarcehlst
The diflfternce or distinction be
tween "ithle 'atrlt" and "the An
archli t" fromi a Wall -trect view, is
forcibly explained in an illustra
tion in the New York Jurnal.
"The Anarchist" is the. fat imer
in tatters in his fiell of grain,
which, when marketed, will scarce
ly realize the cost of production.
He is getting, poorer every year,
though hIe r(lloulºht.s his efflorts and
practices the closcst economy.
HIls farm, once in demand ait $*:,i
an acre, wouild not new realize $20)
an acre. I )espair is d!,'licte onil
every featurc of his furrowed fact.
lie is in dleep meditation, antd will
register his compllaint and protest
on Noveilner 3 next.
"The Patriot" is the Wall street
hark and manipulator in New
York, whose talk is bonds and
gold. lle is seated in a luxurious
ly furnished office, and in touch
with the telegraph in all parts of
the world, Around him is stacks
of bags, filled with gold. It is
he-overflowing with the iilk of
human kindness-fixes the prices
which govern the sale of all the
products of "the Anarchist." It
is he who wonders why "the An
* archist" is "an idiot." a "crank," a
"Bryan assassin of the public cred
it." "The Patriot" cannot under
stand why a man should hunger,
tuld finding no work and having no
money becomes a beggar. The
Patriot standard of measure, of
mankind and of prosperity is guag
ed by his surroundings; he could
not tolerate poverty and want; he
can see no good in any man disput
ing his views on iolitical and eco
somic questions.
Gold to him is heaven, and the
world, if filled with blessings and
every anarchist enjoying the full
est prosperity, would be a hell to
him, Gold is his idol; he can tol
crate no amubition,jwhichhis second
ary to gold. lie has pinned his
faith to McKinley and Ilanna and
Palmer and Buckner, Patriots. who
like him, must save the country
from the rule of Bryan and "the
Anarchist."-Caucasian.
