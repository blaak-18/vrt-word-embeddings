master General for use on rural routes. In

first premium at Illinois State Fair and other

complete directions, and license. We pay ex

Farmers, doctors and rural route agents—
keep out of the mud; stay in your buggy and
pull a rope to open your gate. You haven’t
time to climb in and out of your buggy or
wagon to open or close that old gate,—life
is too short.

VOTE FOR
W. J. SPEER
For State Treasurer
His Record in This Oilice Is
Without a Haw.
Under the law the Treasurer is solely re
sponsible for the deposits of State funds. The
act of 1893 (page 135, Acts of that year) in
plain terms limits such deposits to SIOO,OOO in
any bank.
This is a wise law, and while Treasurer, Mr.
Speer strictly observed it, that possible loss,
litigation and embarrassment to the State
might be avoided.
By careful personal examination of each de
pository, he always knew their actual condi
tion and kept the State’s balance with each
one well within the limit fixed by law. His
examinations of the other banks were equally
as satisfactory. No depositors ever lost a
dollar while he looked after their interests.
This is his record. Vote for him.
