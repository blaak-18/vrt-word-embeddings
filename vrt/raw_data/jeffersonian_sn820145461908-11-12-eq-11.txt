The Ministry of Discontent
AUSTIN BIERBOWER.
Men are now trying more to stimu
late misfortune than to mitigate it.
Few writers are listened to with
such interest as those who exaggerate
the misfortunes of the common peo
ple. Those who would make them
endurable are mistrusted as enemies.
Ihe philosophy that once consoled
men in misery is not respected to
day. There is a demand that people
know their misfortunes, and feel them
keenly. More are trying to make the
people discontented than are trying
to comfort them.
The reason for this is that the
popular leaders want men to remove
the cause of their suffering. They
preach reforms, and the masses will
not rise against their oppressors un
til they feel the oppression. Hence
they would make them alive to their
sufferings. And for the same reason
they would make them realize the
sufferings of others. The wrongs of
the whole people are presented to the
public by reformers who want men
to feel how others are misused, and
to enter into their sufferings. They
create indignation instead of content
and lay the foundation for revolt.
Revolution is needed as an ultimate
result; and a movement is contem
plated for which pain is taken as the
means. The people are made aware
of how bad they feel, and are made
to pity themselves. In Hip past the
work of philosophy, as of religion,
was to make men despise pain, and
bear it without murmuring. They
valued it as discipline even. There
was an effort to render men hardy,
that they might go through adversity
without being overwhelmed by it. In
stead of protesting against it, or seek
ing a cure, they were led to habituate
themselves to it, and to fee] that hap
piness was less in being free from
evil than in being indifferent to it.
The great man was he who could
stand most. Indians proved their
courage by taking blows without
flinching. Bravery in pain was as
pired to, rather than exemption from
pain. Assuming that men were doom
ed to misfortune, they inquired only
how they might endure it nobly. The
world was conceded to be bad, ami
men were schooled to live in it with
out being distressed by the badness.
An effort was made simply to recon
cile men to their unfortunate condi
tion,.
But now this is reversed, and men
are asked to take up arms against
misfortune, and to rectify their con
dition. They are incited to rise
against the present disordered state.
Instead of compromising with their
misfortunes, or recognizing them as
permanent, they seek another kind
of life. The people must get out of
evil, not learn to bear it, and they
should be made to feel it to its full
effect, in order the more to hate it.
The road to heaven is thought to be
byway of hell; and men must realize
their hell before they will seek the
heaven to which they are entitled.
And so wrong is now something to
be righted, not adjusted to. While
suffering it we should know it as an
enemy. Though it must be endured,
it may not be acquiesced in. Its right
Jeffersonian
over us is never to be admitted.
This movement may be called the
ministry of discontent. People are
led to strive for something better
only by being made thoroughly dis
contented with what they have. If
submissive to misfortune, they will
never end it. Reform will be at
tempted only when men are thor
oughly convinced of its need; and
this conviction must come through
suffering. Many are, accordingly,
made to learn how miserable they are,
and to see that they do not deserve
it. The agitators would have them
learn who are responsible for their
misfortune, and who stand in the way
of its removal; and they would have
mon rise, against all such, whether
individuals, corporations, customs,
governments or beliefs. They are
training men in misery, making them
discontented with their condition, that
they may rise against it. They have
declared war against misfortune, and
against its cause, and have resolved
not to be happy till it is uprooted.
The leaders of this movement will
not rest (ill things arc righted; They
have no inclination to stop at the
half-way remedy of consolation. In
stead of learning fortitude in ad
versity, they want to get rid of ad
versity. Never before was there such
a realization of the sinfulness of suf
fering and the abjectness of submit
ting to it. We wrong others in
soothing them into tolerating it. Not
an anodyne, but an irritant, is needed.
Pain is to be cured by pain, the
reality of it by the full consciousness
of it.’
And so, instead of bearing up un
der sufierings, and calming the suffer
ers, we are now to attack the cause.
AV hen- we see a wrong we are to go
for it, as a dog does for a snake. En
mity and perpetual war are declared
against all that is not good, and all
that perpetuates it. The wrong of
patience is preached, the folly of en
durance, the abjectness of humility.
It is a wrong to endure a wrong. Our
duly is to extirpate it, and. instead
of submitting to a bad condition, to
get a good condition. We are to be
happy, not by getting the mind in a
friendly attitude toward suffering,
but by having no occasion for such
attitude. The next reform will,
therefore, he not of the mind to
make it submissive, but of the social
and political conditions, to make them
right. Men’s circumstances are to be
improved, not their tempers; and,
instead of patience, is preached im
patience. and an impatience that will
remove the reason for impatience.
