W'e have received nearly fifty
new subtcrihers in the last two
weeks. This is right, the Popu- t
lists cannot do without an organ
in this parish, andt the town and I
businesu intrests need two papers I
here to keep up healthy competi- t
tion, and as narrow, prejudiced
polities gives all the publc patrco -
age to the other paper, this one
should receive a liberal share of the
private patronaie.
Now is the time to get subsecri
bhers, and every Populist in this
parish hould be induced to sub- I
gcribe for this paper.
Brother C. F. MeCarthey has I
beent authorized to take subscrip
tionsat his appointments and we
hope thosme who do not come toe
the offioe will meet him at his near
eat speaking and subscribe.

Drouth Sufferers.
a The following from the Pro
eressive Age's account of the Rus
ton meeting of representatives of
1 the drouth sufferers with Gov.
Foster and Auditor Heard, reflects
credit on our Police Jury and the
, committee appointed by them for
the relief of the drouth sufferers
of this parish :
o The Governonrsaid his idea was
- to invest the committee with plena
n ry powers in the matter. lie said
il he had had a long conversation
Swith Mr. Scarborough of Natchi
-toches, relative to the manner in
I which rehlief was being distrilbuted
-in that parish, and the system was
e so perfect that he did not see how
e it could well be improved upon.
In Natchitoches there is a parish
- or central committe which appoints
isa subcommittee in each ward. The
. members of these ward committees
make an investigation wherever
s there is a report of suffering or a
- farmer is said to be in need, and
e then make a report to the parish
, committee. If a farmer repre
- sents that he has not the means to
carry his hands through until an
other crop can be raised these
' ward committees make inquiry as
to his financial standing, whether
he owns the land he is working,
Swhether he can secure supplies on
. time, or whether he really is in
such condition that he and those
who have been working for him
will suffer if aid is not extended.
SIf the person seeking aid is found
" to be in a position where he could
Oe secure something to tide him over
be by his own exertions if nothing is
be done for him, while on the other
heand if he is really in need and
not in a position to get any mer
le chant to assist him, the sub-com
Id mittee makes a report of the facts
or aad relief is extended.
Gov. Foster said be thought if
the committees would adopt this
" policy much of the detail work
rd would devolve upon the parish
to committees that the central com
be mittees would appoint, while these
parish committees in turn could
ascertain the exact condition pre
. vailin~ in.the parish through wartd
