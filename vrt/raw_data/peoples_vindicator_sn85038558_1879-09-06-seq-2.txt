SThe erth Leulsialna Candidates.
Some of our Nortn Louisiana jour
Dals have suggested certain gentle
men of their section as fit and prop.
I0lIIes er persons whom it would be well the
Democrats should nominate f ,r the
ditor. nigh and honorable position of Oov
Sornor of Louisiana. Among the3a
19). centlemen is one whose name and
eribe. present official standing revives in
our memory one of the most bitter
ie a dr..ughts, in our opinion, ever pro
sented to the lips of our beloved
Dem. State-which draught he and his
rfnci associates compelled this people to
iee of drink, even to its bitter lees.
We had wished, and do wish sin
cerely, and with all our heart, to for
get the dead past. We had hoped
And the last nail had been driven In that
Ircu. dark, bitter past-that all ,mistakes a
o ex- and crimes committed by those in
whom we had imposed trust and
S confidence, would be buried in that
oblivion which their permanent re
end. tirement would insure. But if this
h Is- gentleman, against whom personal- a
can ly we can say nothing but against
whom politically stands charged and
proven a mistake that pales crime
vets into spotless innocense, should be i
ime urged upon us, the deep, to which 1
res has been confined these errors,
and would, and will be broken up. ,
We believe It beet this gentleman i
rery should retire in the manner provided
that for him by a people who would
ap- rather forget than wound-and we 0
will beg they will not compel that people C
low to add to their universal condemna
for tion the cruel justle of a public dia. d
grace. i
Let's Have Done With It, o
A
ing The Richbland BEACON in speaking at
of "Gubernatorial candidates" has (
this to say:
on After Gov. Nicholls, Oen. Ogden is de
ery perhaps our second choice, and if
nominated we would support him as O1
cheerfully as we ever have any man hi
for the position. There are several si
I, is others who would receive our chbeer
ct. ful support; but we are of the opin
ion that neither our first, second nor
third choice will be selected, for their
names are not on the slate mude up st
in New Orleans. Louis A. Wiltzs, in
als our opinion, will be the man, unless ri
those not In the ring unite on some
I to very strong man before the first vote i
ite is cast in the convention. We have o
ris- no "ax to grind"-no favors to ask
of any man selected for the position
-and look only to the wishes of the
people and good of the 8tate; are
in willing to support any good and ca. tr
eat pable man for the potlion; but are m
still in favor of the renomination of &
en- Gov. Nicholls as our first choice.

the steal of 1876-7, and they, in common
the with the wurid of "good men," have
ov- persistently nlosisted that "If fraud
eae was committed, Mr. Hayes had noth
ad ing to do with It." Lhaving out of
in the question the fact that the taker

This, with a floating debt of $2,- 1
950,000 and something like a million t
In and a half unfunded and loose cer- t
di 'loeates, will, we believe, make the t
Id State debt, in round figures, about
sixteen millions, as we stated to the
re ourset. Is that correct 9-Colfax
le Chronicle.
SIt is not. The "$2,950,000 fl.ating a
e. debt," and the "something like a s
million and one-half unfunded and
loose certificates," we know nothing
of, nor does the AUDITOR OF PUBLIC
AccoUNTs. The debt under the Con- i
' stitution of 1869, could never exceed b
18 $15,000,000-ride that instrument as
amended. The "unfunded debt"
Is does not amount to enough to make B
if our debt twelve millions, while we k
n have leso than nine hundred thou.
i sand dollars of "loose certificates"
which are to be paid from uncollect. tt
ed taxes. a
