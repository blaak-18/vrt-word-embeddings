that timable Prowing to difcesculties en
h:o ontered by the contractor an
blice Jury in securing the right o
as accorded the contractor. On
the 7piirish by Mr. I. N. Satterfield
-orJly the repair, grading, draining and
mainrtetance of forty miles of the
thepublic throughfares of the parish,king
after repeated extensions by the
Police Jury, appears to be just as
fanr from fulfillment as ith ths several
month s ago. According to the
terms of the contract the entire
system of roads, included, in it,
~ should barve been delivered in thor
outghý order by May 1, 1893, but
incet that time owing to diffculties en
lthountghered by the contractor and
obstffcles thrown in the way of the
either tolice acceptry in securing the right of
-way- and requisite width to certain
parts of the road, a verbal extension
dewas accorded the contractor. On
Juworkly the 3rd. the contractor ad
t.dressed a formal commulnication to
thengury stating that he had been
diaetide thatd by illness, and the extreme
heat, in his efforts to comply with
:,,the terms of his contract, and asking
fowas a frther extension of 9 days.
Thented ury adopted a resolution grant
ing the time asked, with the proviso
that wooo be forfeited to the parish,
out of the contractor's $2ooe salary.
Stin.ce the adoption of this resolution
although the contractor has not
officially signified his intention
either to accept or reject the terms
of the extension, yet he has virtually
declared his acceptance of it by a
very determiy evid but futile effort to
work the roads sithat thce Pohich time
othing hasb obtranliged to deal win
dicate that ay contract exists.
At the recetordeeting of the Police
nJury, Mr. S otterfield the contractor
was called en, ipso 'appeared repre
sented by legal counsel. In answer
to the question whether he intended
to f11 th alteration of his contract,
his counsel replied- that Mr. Satter
thwould ittmakeno answer to the

this done in a way that may se- 4

contract, but only in case damages 1
are sustained "ly the, parish-vir-:
.tually no penal cause being em
bodied in the contract.
Nothing has been said but with 4
Christian charity and for the single
purpose that hereafter should the
authorities enter into other con
tracts of a similar nature, they shall
proceed upon strictly business prin
ciples and so guard against any pos
stble complications. No person
-should be paid $s until the terms of
his contract have been faithfully
complied with.
At the next sitting the jury will
doubtless take steps to re-let the.
contract, either as a whole or inl
sections as has been suggested.
Let not one failure discourage,
but let every good citizen lend assis
tance to the jury in the solution of
a problem that is occupying the at
Stention of every community in our
1 country-how to maintain good
public highways.
Sound Advice.
We have been shown a letter writ-.
ten by Messrs. Dan Talmage's Sonkh
SNew York, to a planter friend and
take therefrom certain extracts which
are of general interest and worthy
consideration of every rice planter,
f in fact the principle maintains and
is capable of application, whether
the product be cotton, sugar, rice
or any crop which the producer
makes to sell, Their4indicntment of
the planters scramble to sell last fall,
is just. They tfndoTbtcdly would
concede that the first in. market did
well and only speak of the matter in
a general way, that is to say, while
one or the exceptional inan profited,
the many, i. e. ninety and nine out
of the hundred suffered from the
policy pursued.
Everyone who has the rice industry at
heart, desires that the producer shall not
only get fair but good returns for time, labor
and money expended and can but lament the
t depression of prices during the past year.
Planters are apt to blame every other man,
forgetting each may have contributed by his
i action, to the resulting low prices. For
instance, take last year, when the crop
opened everybody wanted to sell and as a
t result, fully twice as much as the market
could take was shoved into New Orleans last
September. Shipments were continued at an
excessive ratio throughout the season and as
a result of this constant pressure, the market
steadily declined. It simply followed the
well-known law pertaining to supply and
demandd--over supply makes a low range of
value.
r Better prices are now being obtained and
we believe there can be a further raising of
values, but it can only be done by a spirit
r of co-operation. There are. consumers for
every sack of rice raiped this year. What is
to be done?: Feed the demand, that is, ship
in proportions to meet the requirements of
market.
There is no question but that the losses by
a drought in Louisiana. and cyclones on the
Atlantic Coast will favor a much higher
range of values than last year and redound
to the benefit of those who have been fortu
nate in making a crop. Whatever the
Snormal value may be, we would urge upon
t planters the wisdom of deliberation in the
disposition of their product, and you and
your planter friends can serve the crop in
e general and perhaps advance your own inter
ests by shippig in monthly installments,
a thus preventing over supply at any given
t time. By this course the highest average of
values is more likely to be secured,
B We believe that the advice given
s is sound and if acted on will secure
desired results. 6ome might say
t "hold back the crop'-* this, however,
gwould probably defeat the object.
SValues might be unduly enhanced
Sbut as everyone would then naturally
Sdesire to sell, there would be haste
to realint, thus causing a swift re
O action and terrible downfall in prices,
r approximating or similar those of
last year, What is wanted is wise,
a concerted. eoesr.kitive acition and
e the course suggested is natural and
Lt practical, i. e., feed the demand
~market with deliberation-ship ii

Mr. Cade, in conversation with a
Time~-Dpmrno ytlreprteCr said, that
be was gradually dismissing all the
old force in order to take in Demo
crats, and that ere long every Repub
lican in the Mint would be out. He
said that. while he had to discharge
the ladies under him who were in his
4epartment with much regret he had
to take in consideration that each
and every one of them bad been in
the Mint for years, and that he
thought that there were a great
many deserving Democrats who had
never been given a cha t.s'and :R` at
it was his duty to -'help them. . In
almost every case the -lady employes
of the Mint have beei-in oflice many
years, and Seperintendent Cade
thinks that they should gives others
a chance. This rule he had made

only three ladies, the other ladies
in the Mint being in the coiner's
department.
The Aoeldent At Harveys Cannal,.
We take the following from the
timues-Dnmocrat of Sunday. The
fireman, Joe Valuier, whose name is
1mentiaed, is a resident of Lafayette
and hai~spny friends here who were
happy to learn thiat lie had escaped
unhurt. -•
ILat night. at 7:45 o'clock, as
engine No. 339 and a working train
caboose-came dashing by the little
collection of houses on the Southern
Pacific road, at Harvey's Canal, the
residents of.the place who were hor
rifled to see' the'engine, as it reached
thp rail~oad bridge, give a leap, and
-then sith a wild hissing of steam go
down inroto the waters of the canal.
The engine fell almost perpendicu
larly, the tender stood up also verti
cally, one end of it resting on the
engine in the canal and the other
supporting the caboose, which reared
itself upward in the air, at an angle
of about 30 degrees.
Immediately the people ran to the
spot to render what assistance they
could. It was found that the draw
bridge was open, train a wreck, and
the trainmen were picking them
selves up from all sides. The engi
neer, Mike Linch, and the fireman,
Joe Vallier, were on the engine when
it struck the bridge, and the ea
gineer, seeing the danger, yelled to
the fireman to jump. Vallier did so,
and fortunately landed in the middle
of the canal, and save a alight wound
of the hand was unhurt. The
momentum of the train was so great
that he jumped twice as far as he
intended, and had he delayed his
jump a moment later hi. body would
have been dashed against the piling
opposite, and he would have doubt
less been killed. The people who
came up saw him swimming out,
Engineer Lynch stuck to his place
and went down with his engine to
the bottom of the canal. His ex
perience was thrilling and his escape
marvelous. At the first sight of the
open bridge he reversed the lever,
opened the sand valve and yelled to
his fireman to jump, He did not
jump himself nor attempt to, and
after the first shock of the falling
engine he found himself under the
water with his left leg pinioned
between the engine and the tender.
Very fortunately the leg was not
fastened too tight, and with a great
effort he pulled it out, leaving part
of the skin and flesh on the tender.
He then, with commendable presence
of mind and quicker than a flash,
broke the glass of his window and
crawled out through it and came to
the top. He attempted to swim to
shore and was picked up bya .part
of fishermnen, ~onisting oaf Me.Js.
E. F. Dickinsgn; Dan Kelly, Thbmas
Vaughn and Jphn h1cCtackaen.
The people cf.. the place, after a
hasty examination, found that
neither the conductor, Fred Manie,
nor the brakemen. Jim Finlay and
Jim Foster, were hurt, and turned
their attention to the engineer, Mike
Lynch, who appeared to be suffering.
SHe was taken up by kind hands and
.carried to the house. of Mrs. John
.Angousset, near by, :where he was
examined and his left side found to
be injured,
f The Road to Breawt Bridge.
Valley of the Teche.
On Satarday ad inst., on Thursday
7 7th inst., on Saturday 9th inst., and
on Monday a lath inst., our mail
failed, -to reach us, because the train
was behind time. Now on any day
oflthe.week, when the trains are not
on tinme, it is only a delay of a few
minutes in any other place than here;
but at Breaux Bridge it is one of
fully a4 hours .Uandh ox Sattirdays of
48 hours; on Monday *sipn wse
then get three mails at sr.4me.
When.-we ask the minaii-driver uir.%e
Sdoes not wait a few minutes ocr t'-e
arrival of the train, so that he may
lhave tIhe ~dil of the day, his answer
is tha'o -ad from here to the
*dep~ a bad condition
'ke-i ght. 'i fact is that although,

'Hndert to iag 1 'pas ger
througii the road-In the night.' The
writer-himself was forced to start
once during the night to take the
6 a, mi train at Lafayette, and
although he had one of the best
drivers in town, he lost -his way,
upset buggy...pasenger and himself
in a pond of water; part of the bags'
gage was lost and he- finally drove
back to Breaux Bridge, as it was im
possible to land his way to Lafayette,
and the train was missed,
And of this road which is seven
miles long, there is only one mile in
such a shameful condition; and it is
painful to state, that although during
the greater part of the year it is the
only outlet both for travelers and
freight, in spite of all complaints and
temonstrances-the people have never
found it possible yet to obtain relief.
And this in the face of the fact that
we are paying a tax of so mills and
of the awful drawback that it brings
on this ccmmunity.

She was a very qi4t and amiable infan',
