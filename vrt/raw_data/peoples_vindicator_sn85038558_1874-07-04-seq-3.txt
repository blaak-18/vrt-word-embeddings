l1o without negroes I How many bales
of cotton or hogshead of sugar will be p
lmade'l How will the planters pay C
the banks9 He does not ask, "how a
will the planter pay the banks three tl
or four years from now, when his
plantation will be no longer his, but
will be growing up in bushes and
weeds under negro proprietors who
will have bought it at tax sales ;" or
"how will delicate ladies do their I

wherewith to have a negro girl I He s
does not ask whether it would be bet- y
ter to drop the negro now, when there I
would be something left, or to wait It
until he would have to be droped

Bunt let us answer his question, de- a
ceptive and illogical as it is. Let the 1
white people go to work. There are I
plenty of them in this State to raise I
a good crop. Even if they do not I
produce a tenth as muchl cotton as t
with negroes, they would make twice t
as much money by it. They would Ii
he-like the Northern farmer, far
more independent and thriving than
those who hire negroes, and their s
wives would be much more healthy I'
and cheerful without the domineering c
servants under whose incompetency i
and insolence they now groan. u

ANOTIIER TURN IN TIIHE TIDE !

IFrom the Catcasian Extra. I
Judge Bradley returned to the city s
yestcrday. At 12 o'clock lie took his t
seat on the bench with .Judge Woods r
and anntounccd that lie Pad prepared i
a decision upon the points raised by
Mr. Marr, in atrrest of judgment and r
testing the constitutionality of the 3
Ku-Klux act.
Justice Bradley tlren read his de- c
cision, a most lenghthy, exhaustive
and intelligent one.
Under the indictment, the prisoners I
were charged with :1. Conspiracy to
take away certain rights from citizens I
of African descent. 2., The commis- t
sion of murder whilst engaged in this
conspiracy; and found guilty of six
teen counts.
That Congress has the right to pass
laws to carry out the provisions of
the thirteen, fourteenth and fifteenth
amendments, no one will deny. The
question is, how far tis right extends. 1
The thirteenth amendment de
clares that all persons in the United I
States shall not be disqualified from i
voting on account of race, color or
previous condition. The United'c
States is given no power to pass laws
relativeto elections or voting, but
simply to see that the States do not
interfere with these rights. The
United States has only the power to
see these rights enforced. The moo
ment the State fails to comply with
the duties enforced upon it, the United I
States is called on to interfer; and
the interference of Congress, when'
the State is ready to punish violations
of these rights, is unnecessary, in
judicious and illegal.
To constitute an offense of which
the United State has jurisdiction, it
must be shown that a conspiracy was
formed to take away certain rights
fromn a person on account of his race,
color or previous condition.
The fifteenth amendment declares
that the right of every citizen of the
United States to vote shall not be
denied by the United or any State on
account of his race color or previous
condition. When a State refuses this
right, Congress has power to pass laws
to enforce the amendment. Congress
has also the power to pass to secure
these rights against violence and out
rage ,n the part of individuals; there
fore, I am unwilling to affirm the un
constitutionality of this act.
But, letus examine the counts of
this indictment:
The first count charges the prison
ers with conspiring to prevent certain
persons of African descent from peace
ably assembling. The constitution
of the United States declares that
Congress shall not interfere with the
right of peaceable assemblages. Does
this amount to an affirmative law,
giving the United States the jurisdic
tion over all persons who shall in
terfere with the right of peaceable
assemblage ? Clearly not.
The second count is the same as
first.
The third count declares that a
conspiracy was formed to take the
lives of certain citizens of African de
cent, and without due process of law.
All murderers do this. ,Has the'United
States jurisdiction of all murders ?
The fourth countis too vague and
general; so re the tifth and eighth.
Their vagueness is such that they
cannot stand. The sixthand seventh
counts charge the prisoners with con
spiring, against certain persons be
cause they had voted, or were going
to vote, ~Not a word is said that this
was done because-of race, color or
prevlonus condition. This is vitally
necessary. The mere interference
with the right of voting is no offense
under the jurisdiction of the United
States.
The following eight counts are lit
eral copies of the first eight, and must
fall with them.
I am accordingly of the opinion
that the indictment is fatally defec
tive.
Judge Woods then in a few words
announced that he differed in opinion
with Justice Bradley, and that they
had resolved to certify to a difference
of opinion so that the Supreme Court
of the United States could pass upon
the question.
As, however, the Superior Judge
had decided against the validity of
tlhe indictmient, it could not stand
for the present, and the prisoners
were therefore entitled to bail.
Hail in the sum of $8000 for each
plisoner was furnished, and Hadnot,
Cruikehank and Irwin set at liberiy,
and surrounded and congratulated by
their friends.

HAXASLAND PLANTATION.
June 24, 1874.
Editor Caucasian :
Dear Sir :--Understanding that the i
horse disease is prevailing about your r
section of country, Iconclude to soml I
you a recipe for the cure olf same which
I have usedl successfully on every case
It uler my hands.
I first apply warm turlwntine well
rubbed in to the swollen parts, and
then place a piece of cloth over samue,
and press a hot smoothing iron on it.
lThen drench the animal with a half
pint of whiskey, mixed well with sul
phiur, and one spjoonl'ul of spirit of
nitre, and a drachmn of iodide oft po
tassium, once a day, and if the case
does not improve give it every four
holl'rs.
I had one case, a mule, which I
thought cured after a day or two , the
swelling had disappeared, and he ap
picared all right, but on last Sunday
evening came ul, with its head and I
neck terribly swollen. I immediately
used the knife on the swollen parts,
and took out as much as a quart I
suppose, of putrid matter and lumps
of clotted blood. I then bled himi
pretty freely, and inserted a piece of
poke root in each of the openings I
had made with the knife, and le is
now doing well. My mules are now
all right. I would recommend bleed
i;n the first treatment.
I enclose you an extract from a
New Orleans paper, I believe from
the Picayune.
'"With a sharp instrunent wake
several inicisions in the afli tetd plirt,
teko blistering ointment (flies) which
moisten with coal oil, and make a
paster large enough to cover the
whole sore. Suffer this to remain
until copious suppuration is produced.
Meanwhile drench the animal with a
spjoonful of hartshorn in a lialf bottle
of whiskey.
Should the swelling not diminish,
or there be no apparent relief, drench
ing with the above described mixture
º may be repeated thrice within five
holurs, allowing due interval. Keep
the sore well cleaned and apply coal
oil freely."
I remain yours truly,
A. M. HAAS.
A Kentucky farmer refused to look
at a sample sewing machine not long
ago, as lie always "sewed wheat by
lhind." He is related to the man who
did not want a threshing machine on
his farm, "for," said he, "give me a
harness tug or a barrel stave, and I
can make my family toe the mark ac
I cording to the law and Scripter."

for an expression of views. The edit

"GROWLER," P. O., care 'Vindicator.
I We hiope that our friends who have
"ills" they cannot "bear" will take
advantage of this means to "unload.")
IMr. Growler:
'The Brashear News says that the
city of Brashear possesses a constable
against whom indictments for assas
sination, embezzlement, highway rob
bery, shooting his wife with intent to
kill, larceny and attempt to commit
burglary. The Breashear people are
anxious to get rid of hIim. Cant you
swap one of our Police Jurors for
him I Brashear has also a justice of
the peace against whom two grave
charges are pending. His is a prom
ising case, and in case of progress on
his part, I shall report, and perhaps
you may be able to exchange another
Police Juror for him.
LOOK OUT.
Thats right, keep a bright "look
out" for such cases. We think our
parish has "stomach for them all.,
I We can furnish any thing from a jus
tice of the peace up to a DistrictJudge.
No boot required, but we must insist
Sthat these men shall be "4lp to biz."
Can't you lay your hand on some
School board that would pass mester.
Ours have "laid their hand" on every
Sthing here, and every thing has stuck,
something like a Mustard plaster.
Mr. Growler:
It is suggested that when Kellogg

metically sealed in a tin box and
Ilabled "concentrated lie," for preser.
vation in the archieves of Mechanic's
SInstitute. What do you think of the
Sidea?
Cremate him by all means, it would
be a burning shame to overlook the
suggestion. "Concentrated lie" is
r the thing, and that Kellogg lie will
Ykeep, it don't wash.
Dear aiowler:
Please give me your opinion of a
young gentleman who would imagine
a young lady in love with him, simp
ly because she complimented him on
n his personal appearance; and wheth
er that young gentleman is justifiable
in circulating scandalous remarks
as bout a young lady whom he neither
visits or knows.
Yours trulyS, ALMA.
SImagination is a great thing; and
t ALMA, why object tobeing so loving ?
SShould some nice young man compli
ment you on your personal appear
ance, nwould you not feel flattered
And one thing we are at a loss to un
derstand, and that is: ]low you know
a young gentleman imagines a young
lady in love with him unless ie has
so expressed himself. We are afraid
you have kept something back for us
to "imagine." No young gentleman
is justitied in circulating such reports,
and if such young man should visit
young Ladies at all, they ought to take
occasion, then and there, to snub him.
Ilis conduct is not that ofa gentleman,
and he shionul be publicly disgraced.
Let la ;lies assert their rights and no
one will presume to he guilty of such
,gross conduct as that of slanudering
them.

The World's Favorite.
Tl"E SALES of the SINGER lst year
I was the greaitest ever attained for
any Sewing Mach\ine in a year, and was
nearly double the sales of its highest
coipetitor, as may be seen by reference
to the account of sale. for 1873, fromt
sworn returns made to the owners of the
Sowing Machine Patenlt--from which
statistics we select the live leading ma
chines, viz:
The Singer sold 232,444
" Wheeler & Wilson, " 119,190
" Domestic, " 40,114
" Grover & Baker, " 36,176
" Weedl, " 21,769
It will be observed that the difference
in favor of the SING R, is the enormous
anmount of 113,'254 over the highest com
petitor. This result has been obtained
after years of competition.
' We submnit to an interested pnublic if it
is claiming too much to say -the Singer
is the most popular Sewing Machine in
.the world.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished. I I
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a cenimry the
Saturday Evening Post lhas been tilhe
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and hIas ever borne a
widespreadad and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity. rclinqmhcrent
and excellence of th( Serials, Sketchesa
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pire-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this collntry, firomn its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in i
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be readl at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, throughil not qullite so) largo
perhaps, as its younger contemlporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID ANDSUBSTANTIAL,
hased upon the intrinsic muerit of the, pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the p)opulari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, ad the Saturday Even..
ing Post hasbeen in the past, it is our
intention to mako it still better int tlhe
future, and with this oblject in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation..
By increasing its former attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing iwdustry and enterprise, anld Iby
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new"
friendls with each and every issue aindl
continue to nmaintain the claim ot the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of Trl:
OLDEST AND) TIlE BEST Of Famlily Story
