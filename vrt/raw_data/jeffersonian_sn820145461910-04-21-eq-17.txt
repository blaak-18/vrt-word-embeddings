An Elsie Sigel Case in Georgia
Dear Sir: —In reply to yours of
the 24th. You ask me to give you
the facts concerning the policeman’s
wife who tried to convert some Chi
namen, and lost herself and daugh
ter in the work.
This woman was a Mrs. Fannie
Cunningham, but her husband, Mr.
Cunningham, died and left her with
two small children, one boy and one
girl. She married again a man
by the name of Doc Reading, at that
time a policeman of this city, and
now, I understand, a night watch
man at the city stables. Mrs. Read
ing was a member of the First Bap
tist church, one of the most promi
nent churches in this city. She was
selected by the church to teach a
Chinaman. At that time they only
taught one in a class. This China
man was not over twenty-five years
old, and was at that time what I
called the best looking Chinaman in
Augusta; he had some of the fea
tures of American men. He was car
rying on a retail grocery business at
the corner of McKinnie and Rey
nolds streets.
Mrs. Reading would carry him Sun
day-school literature through the
week. That’s what she would tell
my wife that she went there for, and
I believe she told the truth at first,
but finally she took up with him.
After she had taken up with him she
went to the Orphan Asylum and
took her two children out and car
ried them with her to live with the
Chinaman. The boy, after he was
taken to the Chinaman’s became so
bad he got into some trouble; I don’t
remember what the trouble was, but
he was sent to the Reformatory for
some years, I don’t know exactly
how many, and the girl continued on
with her mother and the Chinaman,
and when the girl was about four
teen or fifteen years old the China
man ruined her. That is what her
mother told my wife, and later on I
could see myself that the girl was
not living right. My wife often re
marked to me that it was such a pity
for such a good woman as Mrs. Read
ing was at one time to live and
raise her children up in such a low
way. After she had lived with the
Chinaman, and the girl had been
ruined, some of the members of the
Curtis Baptist church of this city
took the girl out of the Chi
naman’s and turned her over to
a Miss Dovie Shewmake, of this city,
but Miss Shewmake could not do any
thing with her and she let her go,
and a Mrs. Rambo took her. The
last I heard of her she was living
among the sporting women, and I
think she is there at this time, be
cause my wife saw her going in that
direction no longer than a few days
ago. The last I heard of Mrs. Read
ing she had died in the Insane Asy
lum in Milledgeville, Ga. I know
that she lost her mind, but not until
some years after she had lived with
the Chinaman.
The Chinaman is not in Augusta
now, he went back to China some
years ago; about five years ago. I
am glad you are hot after the mis
sionaries; you will do a great deal

of good. Every person I have talk
ed to about your writing concerning
the missionary work agrees with you.
Men that are not Watson men speak
very highly of you in regard to your
missionary writing. I am in favor
of Christianizing the Chinaman and
all nations, because it is the best for
them, but we have many worse peo
ple in Georgia than the Chinamen
are. Any other information that I
can give I will gladly inform yon on.
Yours truly, OLD FRIEND.
The First Modern Newspaper
It is two hundred and one years
ago since the starting of the first
London newspaper, and the fact
turns one’s thoughts back to the ori
gin of an institution that goes much
further back than might have been
supposed.
If to our first parents we owe our
desire for knowledge, then it is to
Caesar that we owe the first Western
attempt to satiate that desire by
means of a newspaper. It was a
daily record of not only official news,
but also of small scandals; the latest
police news, the arrivals in the city,
even the gossip of the countryside.
There were also extracts from the
latest speech of Cicero, and the
freshest epigrams of Martial. These
last apeared byway of advertise
ment of the author’s latest works,
before they should appear in collect
ed form, and be sold, along with the
latest thing of Ovid’s, or those im
proper little novels that came from
Greece, in the fine shops which bor
dered the Forum’s edge and stretch
ed round the Palatine Hill.
Petronius gives us an admirable
parody of what the Roman got in his
daily paper. It was during a feast
at the house of that ostentatious
plutocrat Trimalchion, who so far
forgot his imperfect veneer of aris
tocratic good manners when in his
cups as to describe the origin of his
wife, much to that lady’s discomfort,
for she was still climbing assidu
ously, and did not appreciate being
thus given away in public. When
Trimalchion was sober he could
think of little else save how best to
impress the world with his magnifi
cence, and, in consequence, used to
send for his actuary, who read to the
company a sort of proces-verbal (tan
quam urbis acta) of which the fol
lowing is a translation:
“VII. Cal. Jul: There were born on
the Domain at Cumae, which belongs
to Trimalchion, 30 boys and 40 girls.
500,000 bushels of wheat were trans
ported from the fields to the grana
ries; 500 oxen were used for the
transport. On the same day the slave
Mithradates was crucified for blas
pheming the tutelary deity of Gaius,
our master. The same day 10,000,-
000 sesterces were taken to the bank,
because it was impossible to find a
use for this money. The same day
there was a fire in the gardens at
Pompeii, which originated in the
residence of the farmer Nesta,” etc.,
etc.
The last mention of this Roman
news sheet is in the late days of the
Empire. Vopiscus, in his life of the
Emperor Probus, knew of its exist
ence, after which time M- Humbert
thinks it disappeared along with such
other literature as Constantine and
his new advisers found inconvenient.
Nothing similar appeared until that
officious busybody Gutenberg began
to flood the world with a literature
that has been the outward expression
of a great renaissance.
For all that, the world, still curi
ous, eyes favorably the work of Cae
sar the Magnificent, a work with
which he instructed and delighted
mankind, now well over 2,000 years
ago, and which, by statistical inquiry,
seems to have grown rather than de
creased under ecclesiastical opposi
tion. —Pall Mall Gazette.

More Sugar Trust Graft
The United States took over the
Friar lands in the Philippines some
years ago, paying for them with
Philippine bonds at $lB an acre. The
assumption was that large holdings
of lands by church interests was not
in the best interest of the Islands.
It was provided by law that not more
than 2,500 acres of public lands
should be sold or held by one cor
poration. But recently a sale was
made of 55,000 acres of these same
Friar lands to the Sugar Trust for
$6.50 an acre, and Taft’s Attorney-
General, Wickersham, approved the
sale, on the remarkable ground that
the law did not apply to the Friar
lands.
Now Wickersham is charged with
having been an attorney for the Su
gar Trust, associated with Henry W.
Taft, the President’s brother, who
was counsel for the Sugar Trust two
years ago. Isn’t this getting “graft”
pretty close to President Taft him
self? Is it possible that Taft, the
“great”, the “good”, the “pure”, the
“noble” the man with the “judicial
temperament”, is tarred with the
same stick that has disgraced so
many of the party leaders? If graft
invades the president’s family, where
are honest citizens to go?
What the people would like to
know is this: What is the essential
difference in the holding of 400,000
acres of land by the church, and the
holding of 55,000 acres by the most
soulless, dishonest, grafting Trust on
this terrestrial sphere? Yes, and
giving this 55,000 acres of sugar
lands to that soulless Trust for about
one-third of what they cost? Where
is all this grafting to end? Are the
people blocks and stone that they
don’t rise in protest against such de
spoiling of the public domain?—Kan
sas Commoner.
E. C, Stedman on the Causes
of the War
In a hitherto unpublished letter
given in Harper’s for May E. C- Sted
man, the poet, then (in 1861) a war
correspondent, writes to his mother
in Italy, giving her an interesting
view of the relations of the North
and South. ,
“There is a theory, that the Vir
ginia and Kentucky gentry own
slaves; this is false: I have seen for
myself that the niggars own the gen
try. Now I wish to make you and
Mary understand that, although we
see that this war will probably settle
the slavery question, and possibly
forever limit slavery to the Cotton
States, yet we are fighting the ne
gro’s cause. Slavery has been the
cause of the war in no sense other

than that it has added another dis
tinctness to the line betwixt North
and South which climate and race had
already drawn. The real cause of
the war is a bitter and criminal ha
tred, entertained by the South
against the North, and based on oth
er than slave interests. For fifty
years the character of Southerners
has become daily more domineering,
insolent, irrational, haughty, scorn
ful of justice. They have so long
cracked their whips over negroes
that they now assume a certain in
herent right to crack them over
white men; assume the positive
rights of a superior race; and have
taken advantage of the North’s de
sire for quiet and peace to impose
upon us without stint. For years
the tone of their actions and speech
es, in Congress and society, has ex
pressed this sentiment and determi
nation. Even Southern students at
college, when I was at Yale, adopted
the same tactics. One hundred of
them—poor scholars, but blustering
with rum and bowie-knives—lorded
it over four hundred studious New
Englanders, simply because the lat
ter were studious and desired to at
tain the objects aimed at in a col
legiate course. At length the thing
became degrading, and we arose one
day and kicked them all out. For
fifty years the same plan has been
practised on a larger scale in our na
tional affairs. The South, assisted
by Northern merchants whom it has
governed, has been true enough to
the Union, so long as every election
gave it the power, and as foreign
missions, army and navy commis
sions, presidencies, etc., were held in
its own hands. But the census of
1850 showed that the enterprising
and industrious North was getting
the balance of power. Then the
South began to rebel and would have
seceded had not the Clay compro
mise taken away its sole pretext.
Now the census of 1860, and the Lin
coln election, have revived both the
desire and the pretext, and it has se
ceded”
This is one year when every gar
dener should try an early garden.
Seed do not cost much. If the crop
is not killed, there is good money
and a good table. If the first crop
is killed the loss is too small to be
noted. It is well worth while to
make the effort. The preparation of
the ground would make it all the
better for another planting. A gar
den can not be too well prepared-
Most of the cultivating should be
done before the crop is planted.
There is a chance; a good chance,
for not often does a killing freeze
come after the 14th of February.—
