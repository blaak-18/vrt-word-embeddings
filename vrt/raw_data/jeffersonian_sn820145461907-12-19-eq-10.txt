LETTERS LEOTI THE PEOPLE
GOT WHAT HE EXPECTED.
I desire for you to publish this
communication, which is as follows:
“Lavonia, Ga., Nov. 19, 1907.
“President Theodore Roosevelt,
Washington, D. C.
“Dear Sir: On Nocember 4,
I wrote you a letter enclosing stamp
for reply, stating we have five banks
in Franklin county, Georgia, that say
they are tight up for money just at
this time. I wish to know’ if you can
make some arrangements to furnish
these banks if they will give ample
security. I see you have helped
‘Wall street/ The people say, in this
Southland, that they can secure any
amount they desire to borrow.
“If you have not the spare time
to answer this letter, please get one
of your boys or girls to reply. lam
very anxious to know 7 . I enclose an
other stamp.
“Very respectfully,
‘ “J. A. M’DUFF.”
“Washington, Nov. 23, 1907.
“J. A. McDuff, Lavonia, Ga.

addressed to the President, lias been
referred to this department for re
ply. In response, you are informed
that it is not feasible at this time
to grant your request and make de
posits of public funds in the banks of
Franklin county, Georgia.

last letter to get a reply, and I got
about what 1 expected.
Respectfully.
J. A. M’DUFF.

THINKS BEST NOT TO BUTT IN.
Augusta, Ga., Nov. 22, 1907.
(It may be Thompson, or Tompson,
or Tomson, or —well, it’s up the Geor
gia Railroad, for I have been there.)
Dear Sir: You will find enclosed one
year’s subscription to the Weekly
Jeffersonian. Address 839, as before,
dates will be October 11, 1908.
I regard your Weekly one of -the
best I have ever read, and the monthly
wit h ou t com pa ri son.
Once, when much younger than I
am now, 1 occasionally “butted’’ in
to the newspapers, and still feel at
times like calling some things by
names other than those now 7 applied,
but I guess seventy-seven is too old
to serve on the jury.
Yours truly,
W. W. WOODWARD, SR.
839 Phillips street.
ONE OF JOHN MORGAN’S COM
MAND.
Gashland, Mo., Nov. 20, 1907.
Dear Sir: Enclosed find $2. Ex
tend my subscription to the maga
zine and Weekly. I have been a sub
scriber since your first venture in
New York, and am well pleased with
both publications. You can count on
my subscription as long as I live.
I served four years in General John
Morgan’s command, and was sur
prised and delighted in Gen. Basil
Duke’s position in Kentucky. I hope
the General is getting your magazine.
If not, send him a sample copy. The
ex-Confed’s position in Kentucky is
io be commended, and when such men
as General Duke and General Buck
ner get upon their high horse, we lit
tle Confeds know 7 something is going
to happen.
5 our publications are all and more
than one might expect. Every fea
ture of them, particularly wour edi
torials, is worth more than the sub
scription.
Your friend and well-wisher,
J. B. JOHNSON.
R. F. D. 1.
(Note —Hon. Homer Sturgis, and
hundreds of other survivors of Mor
gan’s cavalry will be interested in
this letter. Yes, General Basil Duke
shall have copies. The General’s
“Life of Morgan” is in my li
brary.—T. E. W.)
AN OREGON VIEW.
Portland, Nov. 16, 1907.
Dear Sir: We are just now having
a beautiful example of our best bank
ing system that the world has ever
seen, we have had in the West for
the past six or seven years, what
the plutocrats call great prosperity;
wages were high and all kinds of
goods that the laborers must buy were
much higher, so the trusts got all
there was left after the people got to
the end of the month. But that was
not enough. The banks got all the
money there was in the country on de
posit, and as the demand for loans
was not enough at home to use it at a
large interest, they sent it to New 7
York banks to be loaned on call, at
any rate obtainable. The trusts w 7 ere
about ready to make a squeeze, so
they got the governor to declare a
holiday. Now 7 the question is, will
the people see through this scheme,
or will they be fooled again as ever?
It is the old, old game over and over,
the laws are made to govern the poor,
and the rich govern the laws. If
it be true that you can’t fool a ma
jority of the people all the time it
is about time we began to see some
evidence of it.
We have made some headway in
Oregon, as we have the initiative arid
referendum, and through it have got
a good direct primary law 7 , in which
we elect United States senators by
direct vote of the people, and now
that the politicians see what it means,
they are conspiring to get the courts
to declare it unconstitutional, but we
are making ready to meet them by
initiating four more laws to be voted
on this coming election, which I tiring
will give them something else to think
about. I will send you a copy of
those law’s soon.
Yours very sincerely,
FRANK R. WILLIAMS.
LAST LEGISLATURE HURT THE
OLD VETS.
The last legislature hurt the old vets
when it made the change in payment
of the pensions. If payments were
in the old way, I could borrow money
enough to relieve my present distress,
hut now I could not borrow enough
Io buy fifty pounds of flour.
Respectfully yours,
E. J. STEPHENS.
Newnan, Ga., Nov, 23, 1907,
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
THIS IS APPRECIATED EVER SO
MUCH.
Aragon, Ga., Nov. 21, 1907.
Dear Sir: I have your postal of
the 19th inst., and am plea§£<d to say
that both Weekly and monthly come
to me with due regularity. That I
appreciate your splendid work is evi
denced by the fact that, on Septem
ber 24th last, I sent you my chefck to
pay for renewal for another year.
And so it will be each year, when the
October month arrives, expect a re
mittance from me. When the time
shall come that my renewal fails to
materialize, just say, “Another old
Federal soldier has gone to the join
the Grand Command.” You have my
earnest and sincere good wishes in
your brave effort to bring about the
re-establishment of those principles
of government that we both love —
equal rights to all and special privi
leges to none. God bless you.
Cordially yours,
T. A. DOLAN.
P. S. —Our postmaster, Mr. Law’son,
is your agent at Aragon.
FROM A RETIRED UNION ARMY
OFFICER.
N. 11. D. V. S.
Ohio Crossroads, near Dayton, Mont
gomery Co., Ohio, Nov. 8, 1907.
Dear Sir: Allow me to salute yon
as a. veteran and also acknowledge
the Weekly’s salute by saying it is
a brainy paper, edited by a brainy
man, just what I like, and must have.
My eye is intent on the magazine, so
allow me to say, by following the
lines of Abe Lincoln’s (remark at
Gettysburg, w 7 hen he said, “God must"
have loved plain people; he made so
many of them.” So, in his wake,
,allow me to say, “God must have
loved fools; he made so many of
them who vote against their person
al interests by neglecting to subscribe
100 cents for the Weekly Jefferson
ian.
I like The Commoner very much,
edited in Lincoln, Neb. It is on the
line with the Weekly Jeffersonian. Tn
nature there is two of a kind of
every existing thing. The white oak,
the black oak, and so on throughout
the universe, ending in a. God, a devil,
a heaven, a hell. In my last Weekly
I was impressed with the idea of the
presidency. Two of a kind. Which
shall I select? Thomas E. Watson or
William Jennings Bryan? The white
oak is the best timber for certain pur
poses. The black oak the best for
other purposes. Watson and Bryan are
both oaks. Which is the best? None
but the mechanic, the farmer and
wage earner can tell. Thomas Jeffer
son, assisted by Thomas Paine, is my
test. This is an age of reason, not
fault-finding. Equal rights under the
law for all our natural rights so far
as they are consistent with the public
good.
CAPT. ADDISON R. TITUS,
IN “BETHANY” SHE LIVED IT
ALL OVER AGAIN.
Austell, Ga., Nov. 25, 1907.
Dear Sir: I have neglected no op
portunity of supporting and trying to
advance all your publications. I sub
scribed and received the Tom Wat-
son Magazine until it was dead; the
last numbers were not so interesting.
Watson was missing. This year I
have had the Weekly Jeffersonian.
Could not afford the magazine. The
old widow’s bank account is dead. In
February last I sent you a club for
the premium, “Bethany.” Thank
you for “Bethany.” It gave me
more real enjoyment than any 7 book
since the Civil War in reading it. I
lived my life over. I laughed and
cried. Lived through the .
of election of Lincoln; the hard con
test on secession, with the South’s
greatest and best statesmen on both
sides. I had been a close observer
and reader through the fifties; was
twenty years of age when all this
was at fever heat. Yet “Bethany”
gives me the sad pleasure of living
it over again at sixty-six, 1907.
Yours truly,
MARGARET A. KERLEY.
WANT THEM BOTH AGAIN.
Anniston, Ala., Nov. 25, 1907.
Dear Sir: Please find enclosed P.
O. money order for $2, to renew my
subscription for the magazine and
Jeffersonian paper. I have been get
ting them regularly, and don’t want
to miss a single , copy. My time will
be out December Bth arid 13th.
Yours truly,
I. N. DUKE.
MUST HAVE IT AGAIN.
The Rock, Ga., Nov. 23, 1907.
Dear Sir: Enclosed find sl, for
which please renew my subscription
to your valuable paper, the Jeffer
sonian.
Respectfully,

your Jeffersonian Magazine, and
wishing to continue the same I here

Please continue to E. H. Akridge,

HOW IT IS IN IDAHO.
Winona, Idaho, Nov. 7, 1907.
My Dear Sir: Please find enclosed
the poem that I promised to send
you. In writing same from memory
I omitted the third verse which you
will find on a separate sheet. As you
are evidently an admirer of poetry I
hope you will like this.
What do you think of the financial
embargo? Has the Republican party
the power and prowess to bring to
the nation prosperity, and also the
dangerous black art of spreading
over us the pall o fadversity with its
attendant ills and uncertainties?
Here the farmers take their grain
to the storehouses at Tramway and
railway stations, and they get neither
cash nor cheeks for it. Nothing but
a receipt, with a promise that when
the “money famine” is over, and
when the N. P. Railway Company will
lurnish cars, checks may be forth
coming. Crops here were unusually
abundant, and the fall weather bright
and mjld, until three days ago, when
