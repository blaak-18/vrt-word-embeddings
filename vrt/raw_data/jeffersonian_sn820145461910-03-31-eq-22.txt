ANOTHER DESERVING INDUS
TRIAL-LITERARY SCHOOL.
Dear Sir: —Will you admit an
other industrial school into your ring
of favorites?
Doubtless, you know but little, if
anything, of our school. It is Beth
saida, another of Laurens county
schools, and it is only a few miles
from Poplar Springs Industrial
School. These two schools are being
run on the same plan.
1 have three literary teachers in
my school and a music teacher, who
teaches in the Poplar Springs School
also.
1 have just succeeded in getting
the industrial work added to the
course of study at Bethsaida, and, of
course, it will be of some expense to
equip the school for the work, and
we will be compelled to ask for help
from outsiders.
Several of the patrons of my school
are very fond of you, and have asked
me why I have not written to you.
So I decided we could be one of your
favorites as well as other schools.
Now, anything that you can do to
help us in our burden of school ex
pense will be very highly appreciated,
I can assure you.
Sincerely,
(Miss) NORA EMERSON,
Principal.

HOPE OUR CIRCULATION WILL
REACH MARK YOU SET.
Dear Sir: —May the circulation of
your two Jeffersonians extend until
an overwhelming majority of the
voters may not only read them, but
that they may realize how the classes
are binding, hand and foot, the mass
es by the enactment of unjust laws,
stripping us of every vestige of our
rights, and may their patriotism, love
of country, and of home, be fired un
til they will place beneath their feet
the party collars, and in one solid
phalanx go to the polls and elect,
once more, such patriots and lovers
of the rights of the people as your
self, and drive from our temples of
justice the infamous binders of
shackles upon the limbs of the long
suffering people.
Long may you live, and may God
give you wisdom and strength to con
tinue your noble and unselfish fight
until you see the full fruition of your
many years of toil with pen and
tongue.
Very truly yours,
W. W. LITTLEFIELD.

IF THE PREACHERS HAD TO
PAY!
Dear Sir:—l have been a sub
scriber to your Jeffersonian twelve
months, and can say truthfully that
it is the greatest paper of all papers.
It does my heart good to read after
you. If some of those preachers had
to dig the money out of the ground
like we do, to send to the heathen,
in place of strutting on the streets of
our towns, with a long-tailed coat on,
I think they would do less begging
and more praying.
Enclosed find money order for
both Magazine and Jeffersonian. I
had rather have The Jeffersonian
than all the papers I take—seven in
all. P. C. CARTEE.

A BUSY MAN’S ENDORSEMENT.
Dear Sir: —I am a man of about
your age, having been born in ’56.
I am a very busy man in fall and
winter and I only scan the headlines
of the papers, but when yours comes
to hand I stop and read an hour or
two, even if some of my irons burn
in the meantime.
I would like to say that I endorse
all you have said in regard to For
eign -Missions, and as to politics, I
admire your grit,—but it is like
kicking against the pricks. The laws
have been made by the rich in favor
of the same precious class ever since
Nimrod domineered at Babylon.
Nothing short of an American Revo
lution will reform Uncle Sam. If a
third party becomes sftong enough
to take hold of Government, it ab
sorbs one or the other of the old par
ties, rascals and all.
I see you do not like the Catholic
church. I hate it like I do the Devil,
—who has dominated it since the
days of Constantine. It has never
done any mission work where it did
not expect to get it back with big in
terest.
Enclosed find price for renewal of
weekly.
Yours, etc.,

A TRUE PEN PICTURE OF
LINCOLN.
Dear Editor:—Southern in senti
ment and belief, I find but little
pleasure in reading Northern peri
odicals. I read, some time ago, an
article in your Magazine outlining
briefly the character of Lincoln.
While this was in striking contrast
to the opinion held by our Northern
brethren, it was, nevertheless, the
truest portrayal of the man whom
the North wishes to idolize that I
have ever read. It is through the
efforts of the few men like Tom
Watson that our cherished Southern
traditions are retained, and I deem
it the duty of every Southern man
to hand down to posterity the real
facts that have led to so great a dif
ference in opinion between the two
sections of our Union. I would not
have it understood that I desire to
cherish animosities that had their
origin in what has passed; nor
would I arouse, for a moment, the
bitterness that once existed. But the
day will come when the unfinished
work must be finished, since the
great problem was only partially
solved, and then, who knows but
these memories and traditions may
find a place for their vindication?

OLD SOLDIER RETREATS FROM
FORMER POSITION ON
MISSIONS.
Dear Sir:—lf you had “Inde
pendent Mission Work,” by Bishop
Wm. Taylor and his son, Hutson
Taylor, it would be useful to you.
This work treats of the missionary
work and wonderful results obtained.
I have just sent for a copy of the
work, and as soon as I get it will ex
press it to you to Thomson. I wrote
you last spring suggesting that you
might get from Bishop Taylor’s life
some information on Foreign Mis
sions, but this gives you direct re
sults.
I am an old Confed, —four-year-
old one, at that—and a Methodist.
You have changed me in regard to
this mission business. Where I was
once blind, now I see. How my heart
leaped for joy when I saw Brother
Dunbar’s stand, one Methodist

A JEFF. CONVERT.
Dear Sir:—l have never written
or attempted to write to any paper,
but I wish I could express my feel
ings in The Jeff. I subscribed for
The Jeff one year ago, and didn’t
like it, but it kept coming, and I con
tinued to read it, and now, dear
readers, I tell you that I will always
take the paper, for I believe that it
tells the truth.
I know just how some of the peo
ple he has been attacking feel, be
cause I remember my experiences at
school when my teacher would catch
up with me in some of my tricks.
And is it a fact that that mission
controversy was called off by the Ad
vocate? I wanted to hear some
smart man that knew his business
try to knock the socks off Mr. Wat
son, but as I haven’t seen anybody
do it, I have become a little “jubi
ous” about any one being able to do
it.
Yours for the straight truth,

HOW THEY WRITE TO DUCK.
Dear Watson:—A few days ago, I
got a circular letter from Union
News, Duckworth’s paper, informing
me that my subscription had expired,
and they had been compelled to dis
continue it to me, but they felt sure
it was an oversight of mine in not
renewing. I just turned the sheet
over and wrote on the back, “No,
not an oversight; when the editor
of that paper comes down to Texas,
and, with others, manipulates a reso
lution through a Texas Union Con
vention, at Galveston, favoring a
Merchant Marine Ship Subsidy steal,
it was evidence sufficient to my mind
that he was a traitor, and was there

Wouldn’t it be nice within a week or
so to begin to say goodbye forever to
the scalding, dribbling, straining, or
too frequent passage of urine; the fore
head and the back-of-the-head aches;
the stitches and pains in the back; the
growing muscle weakness; spots before
the eyes; yellow skin; sluggish bow
els; swollen eyelids or ankles; Iteg
cramps; unnatural short breath; sleep
lessness and the despondency?
I have a recipe for these troubles
that you can depend on, and if you
want to make a quick recovery, ypu
ought to write and get a copy of it.
Many a doctor would charge you $3.50
just for writing this prescription, but I
have it and will be glad to send it to
you entirely free. Just drop me a line -
like this: Dr. A. E. Robinson, 1&.657
Luck Building, Detroit, Mich., and I

harmless remedies, but it has great
healing and pain-conquering power.
It will quickly show its power .once
you use it, so I think you had better
see what it is without delay. I will
send you a copy free—you can use it
and cure yourself at home.
