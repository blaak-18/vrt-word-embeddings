Our Hon. Police Jury have at
last heeded our patient and ear
nest petitions and opened a public
road from this city to St. Maurice.
Instead of crossing that muddy
little bayou on a narrow bridge at
one place, and an impassable ford
at another, the road now continues
on the Northeast side of that bay
ou, not crossing it at all.
This is better than before, and our
solons merit, and will doubtless
have the thanks of the public for
doing their duty.
IF you want fine liquors at re
duced prices, go to Brown & Har

We are pained to note the death
of one of our leading citizens,
Jones J. Johnson, which sad event
occurred last Tuesday morning at
2 o'clock, after a short illness.
The funeral took place from his
residence at 4:30 p. m., Tusdayay,
amid a large concourse of friends
and relatives; the Knights of Py

attended in a body, forming a part

He was 48 years of age, and
had been an esteemed citizen of
our parish for many years, and for
about fifteen years of this city.
He leaves a wife, four children,
some other relatives and many

first Farimers' Alliance in his wart.
and has tilled every station from
that to mllember of the State Alli
IBeing one of the ort._a:nizers of
the Peoples party in this parish.
Mr. Brown way induced to make'
the race on that ticket for Clerk
in 1s1+2, when he made a credita!lie
and patriotic fight for his party,
without hope of success.
In the opening of the Presiden
tial campaign in 181.2, Mr. Brown
was elected Chairman of the 4th
District Congressional Executive
Coniunittee, and served until 1894,
when he was continued on same
committee, and made secretary.
Ie has dlone much valuable service
for his party, and is an unconlro
mlising fearless leader.
Mr. Brown is in his 31s?,t year-
in the prime of life-hals a splen
did common school education, is
possessed of high moral principl)es,
inculcated by that fine old gentle
man, I)r. J. M. Brown, his father,
and he is in every way well quali
fied for the lposition he seeks.

honor of his conmpany to dinner.
Elsewhere in this issue appears
the announcement of Mr. E. J.
Gamble as a candidate for Sheriff
before the Populist primaries. Mr.
Gamble has been a citizen of our
parish for about 21 years, living
most ot this time in ward 4, near
8t. Maurice, but for the last few
years in this city.
Mr. Gamble is noted for the de
cided and conrageous stand he al
ways takes upon one side or the
other ot all public questions, and
hence has, as all such men will
have. his enemies as well as his
friends in polities.
Mr. Gamble has long agreed with
Poqlists In most of the reforms
they advoeate, but did not lose
faith in the Democratic party as a
party of reform antil the opening
of the last congressional campaign,
when he formally joined the Peo
ple's party, and worked with his
usual vim and enthusiasm for the
aesuccess of its eandidate, Mr. Bai
ley, and his assistance in carrying
this parish by esuch a handsome
maorirty is recognised by the Pop
alists everywhere.

CASTLE HALL. NATeCHITOCIlES LODGE
89, K. or P., July 17th, 1895.
Whereas it has pleased an allwise and
just God to remove from among us by
death our Brother J. J. Johnson, Sr..
Resolved, That in his death our order
has sustained the loss of a worthy and
faithful member and our country a good
and upright citizen. That he was a man
true and generous; firm but retiring in
his na'ure, one whose course in dealing
with his fellow men was ever charac
terized by that spirit of fairness and
love of justice, which is so characteris
tic of nobility of nature.
Resolved, That in his death his fami
ly has lost a kind and indulgent father
and husband, and we tender them our
deepest sympathy.
Resolved, That a copy of these reso
lutions be spread upon the minutes of
the Lodge, and a copy be sent to the
family of our deceased brother.
Resolved, That the Charter of the
Lodge be draped in mourning and the
members of the lodge wear the usual
badge of mourning for 80 days.

Do not worry over the fact that
you find your reform path beset
with obstacles in the shape of ob
jections, ridicule, calumny, abuse
and even your sanity questioned.
You, as a reformer, are traveling
the same rough pathway that every
man or woman who has had origi
nal ideas has gone over. Go back
to the dawn of creation and trace
the history of the world, and find
if you can a single step civiliza
tion has ever made, a single inno
vation in science, political econo
my, or in the field of invention,
that has been accepted without hav
ing passed the ordeal of objections
raised by unbelievers, and that did
notpass through a period of pooh
poohs and ridicule, and the pro
]ectors subject to abuse, ostracism,
and in many instances martyrdom.
This being true, as you well know
if you have read history, then
think it not strange, fellow-worker
in the cause of reform, that you
should find many unbehevers in
the faith you so earnestly espose.
A consciousness of right and a firm
determination to stand by your
principles to the end will at last
wmn the victory, in spite of the op
position of the thoughtless masses,
who, as the logic of events and the
work of agitation and education
enlighten their dark understanding,
will eventually join you. Fear not
but go forward.
