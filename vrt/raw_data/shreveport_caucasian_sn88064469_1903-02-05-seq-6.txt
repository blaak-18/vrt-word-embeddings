Wereigu Minister Prinetti Seized With en
Attack of Paralysis.
Rome, Jan. 30.-Foreign Minister
Prinetti had an attack of paralysis in
his right side while being received in
audience by King Victor Emanuel. He
was removed to his home in a serious
condition. The ministers were hold
ing their usual semi-weekly confer
ence with the king at the Quirinal
when Signor Prinetti, who was ad
dressing his majesty, suddenly threw
up his arms, staggered and would have
fallen but for the fact that he was
caught by his colleagues. The incident
caused great excitement. The king
rang for assistance, and Minister of
Commerce Bacelli, who is a physician,
was able to do what was immediately
necessary. The king, who is specially
attached to Minister Prinetti, is much
affected. His majesty decided that the
minister should be put to bed in the
Quirinal. but Dr. Bacelli decided that
it would be necessary to convey him to
his own home, which was done.
One of the ministers went ahead to
break the news to Signorita Prinetti.

Fort Wayne. Ind., Jan. 30.-Four
men were killed, one fatall and three
others seriously injured and half a
score of others more or less severely
hurt by an explosion which wrecked
a large section of Eckart Packing com

The dead: John Foltz, Fort Wayne;
Red Matthews, Plymouth, Ind.; Henry
Piepenbrink, Fort Wayne; Conrad
Miller, Fort Wayne.
Seriously injured: John Yorst, fa

Keller.
The explosion occurred half an hour
after the operations had begun for the
day, and it is believed to have been
due to accumulation of natural gas in
the cellar beneath the section of the
factory destroyed.
There were a score of men at work
in the several departments at that see
tion of the plant, And scarcely one es
caped injury of some sort. The force
of the explosion was terrific, com

Washington, Jan. 2t.-The gur
with which the police departmeuc of
the District of Columbia supply the
"white House are usually faithful and
discrimininating officers. Sometimes
they are a trifle overreacting. The oth
er day Mrs. Roosevelt was stopped by
one of them and compelled to tell who
she was before being allowed to enter
the White House grounds. She had
been out walking and returned by way
of the entrance to the executive office.
She wore a brown welking skirt, a
black jacket and

"YOU OAN'T GO through her e,
THROUGe. m a d am. The
grounds are closed to the public."
Mrs. Roosevelt paused for a moment,
and, looking up pleasantly at the big
officer, replied:
"I know, but I live here. This is my
home."
Then the officer realized who the
lady was and backed away, with a
stammered apology and a crestfallen
air. The dog looked him over and trot
ted away after his mistress. There
was a worried expression on -the offi
cer's face until a veteran guard who
had witnessed the incident came up
and gave him this reassurance and ad
vice:
"She won't mind, but I'll give you a
pointer. When you see that dog with
any one, let that person in. That dog
won't go with any one but some mem
ber of the family and won't let any one .
else touch him. You can't go wrong if
you keep your eye on the dog."

A treasury official was fortunate
enough the other day to get a ton of
coal, which was deposited on his side
walk late is the afternoon. A colored
man agreed to put it away for a quar
ter. When he had finished the job, he
presented a bill for 3.5 cents.
"Why, I thought you said a quarter."
queried the officeholder.
"A quarter for putting it in. but 10
cents extra to pay a man to watch it.
You see. if some one had taken a cou

Senators In the course of a
a speech the other day
the venerable Senator Hioar of :,iassa
chusetts uttered this seutence:
"You,, M r. President. although a
young man. can remembler."
A smile rippled around the chamber.
The chair was being occupied tempora
rily by Senator Depew. who blushed
like a Ieach as he glanced from the
playful Massachusetts statesman to
where Mrs. Depew- was sitting in the
reserved gallery. After' the session the
adolescent Chauncey slapped the juve
rile George Frisaie on the back and
called him "old boy."
In the marble room of the capitol the
other day Senator Morgan of Alabama,
who is nearly seventy, was talking
with a lady caller. The lady was old.
she was plain, and her dress indicated
that she was seekLng the aid or influ
ence of the Alabama senator for some
purpose. Directly opposite sat Senator
Spooner of Wisconsin. looking debo
nair, conversing with two young, hand
some and tailor gowned ladies. Pres
ently the callers all departed. The sen
ator from Alabama approached the
senator from Wisconsin.
"You young chaps have the chicks
come to see you, while old men like me
have to be polite to the hens," he said
playfully.
And yet the senior senator from Wis
consin is over sixty years of age.
It has, however, remained for Sena
tor Foraker to especially thrill the sen
ate with joy. He was discussing the
militia bill. and, glancing around the
chamber, with a comprehensive ges
ture, he exclaimed:
"Why, we are all of us-all of us
subject to militia duty-that Is, all who
are under forty-five, as most of us sure
ly are."
Whereupon Senator Platt shook
hands with Senator Depew and Sena
tor Pettus smiled benignly upon Sena
tor Vest.

where the constituent was struck with

"What's going on, Lewis?" he asked.
"Is there a circus in town or some

"No." said Mr. Nixon; "this is just

"Great guns!" said the Virginia vis
