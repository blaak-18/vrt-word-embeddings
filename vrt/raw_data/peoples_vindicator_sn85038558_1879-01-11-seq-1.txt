91 ANNIS NYRTLE.
I came to Lirs inel69, i. order to
superintead--i the name of a Com
pany formed at London-the explora
tions of mines which existed only
open the chart )avented by the
would-be guarantees. The inspec
tion of the soil soon made me.under
stand that my silent partners had
been doped. Before returning to
Europe, we washed to receive some
advantage from that long voyage.
Wishing to receive instruction, and
also to satisfy my curiosity, I resoly
ed, in company with two of my com
panions, Messienrs Smart an Colt
ron, to visit Chimberaso, the highest
and most imposing of the mountains
of Peru.
One morning, after bhaving pased
the preceding night in an Indisi vil
lage, we began to ascend the foot
path which is foound at the base of
this giant of the Andes, when, raialng
my head, I saw that the radiance of
the eternal snows which surround
the summit of the mountain was dis
appearing, little by little, by reason
of a thick mist.
The natives who served usas guides
threw alarmed glances toward those
inauspicious vapors, and, shaking
their heads, assured us that we were
threatened with a violent hurricane.
Their fears were soon verified.
The mist extended with rapidity
along the sides of the mountains, anad
we were soon plunged in thick dark.
nees. The atmosphere was sufoca
ting, and yet so moist that the steel
of our watches was covered with rust.
The river near which we were walk
ing was running with redoubled
vigor.
Suddenly, and as if by magic, there
rushed through the rocks upon our
left a multitude of streams, which
were dragging along with them the
tranks of trees and bushes that had
been torn up by the roots. I also
perceived an enormousserpent, which
was struggling and making useless
efforts to resist the violence of the
waters.
Soon thunder was heard, which
awoke all the echoes of the moaon
tari. Each moment the lightaing
sent the clouds below as, above ns
and on either side. We could al
most believe ourselves in the midst
of an ocean of ire.
We sheltered ourselves under the
shade of a great tree, while one of
our guides sought for as a more se
cure asylum. lie soon returned and
announced that he had found a spa.
tious cavern, which would afford us a
su lcleut protection agalnst the vio
lence of the elements. We started
immediately but it w with thte
gutset aii'uty l tat-we toadced
the designated place.
The tempest prolonged itself with
a noise soterrible that we could not
bear one another speak. I stood in
silence at the entrance of the cavern,
and I observed through the opening,
which was long and narrow, the seone
without. The highest cedars were
torn up by the roots or bent like
reeds.
Some monkeys and parrots, killed
by the falling of the branhes, were
scattered along the ground. The
streams had become great rivers
which followed the sides of the moun
tains

Thonve .ileL we had sought

While we were peakiong of the

Their eyes were of a greaisk eslor;

Our formidable enemy at first at..
tempted to raise the stobe with his
powerful paws, and afterward tried to
push it back with his head. The
uselessness of his efforts only increas
ed his rage. The sentiment of pa
teinity made him still more angry.
"Ii is time to fire upon him," then
Mr. Smart said. "Aim at his eyes;
the ball will pass through his brain,
and we shall have a chance of being
delivered from our danger."
Fern had taken his double-Larreled
gun aId Mr. Colson his pistols. They
passed their fire-arms through the
orifice and pulled the trigger; but
the cap had become wet, and it was a
long time before the discharge was
heard. The tiger, which had com
prehended what was passing, made a
bound to one side, but feeling that he
was not hurt, he returned to his place,
and his fury seemed to be redoubled.
The caps had become wet, and my
two companions hastened to renew
tilem. As for myself, I sought our
powder flasks, which we had placed,
with our useless clothing, against the
walls of the cavern. I found under
my hand the young tigers, and I com
prehended by the contact that these
two ravenous animals were playing
with our powder flasks. They had
drawn out the cork, and the priming
powder scattered over the moist
ground could no longer serve us. This
terrible discovery plunged as into the
most profound consternation.
"All is lost!" cried Mr. Smart.
"There only remains to decide which
will be the better, to die of hunger
with the animals shut up with us, or
to place an immediate end to our suf
ferings by allowing the monster with
out to enter the den."
Speaking thus, Smart placed him
self near the stone which we were
supporting, and fixed his gaze upon
the flashing eyes of the monster.
Young Colson was in despair. Fern,
who had more presence of mind, took
a bit of cord from his pocket and
went to the other end of the cavern,
without telling as for what purpose.
We heard soon a smothered whizzing,
and the tiger which had heard the
noise, appeared to experience a still
greater trouble. He went and came
before the entrance of the den, roar
ing terribly. He stopped at length,
and turned his head toward the side
of the forest, without ceasing to roar.
Our two Indian guides busied them.
selves in discharging arrows from the
tops of the trees in which they were
perched. The animal was cousidera
bly pricked by them, but the thick.
aess of his skin rendered thmese darts
comparatively inoffensive. At length,
however, one of the arrows struck the
tiger near the eye, and remained fixed
near the wouond. His fury then reacha
d its height. He sprang toward the
tree, as if be would tear it up by tihe
roots. In the efforts which he made
he was freed from the arrow, and
returned to the entrance of the earv
ern.
Fern now returned to us; he car
ried in his arms the two young tigers,
which he bhad strangled, and without
speaking threw the animals out of
the deo. The tiger had no sooner
smelt of the two victims, and per.
coivad that they were without life,
than, ino despair, he began to roar so
furiously that it wa;necensary,to stop
our ears.
I felt that I ougt to reprimand
Fern for what be had done without

Suddenly the female became sileot,
and leaned her head against the open

fury, as if to force an entranoce into
our refuge. All our united eforts
were neceseeary I order to bold in

As for ourselves, we made the great.
eat haste to escape, for we heard
again the roarings of the tigers, al
though the noise seemed at some dis
tance. Then we followed our guides,
taking a by-path. The great number
of roots and branches which the tem
pest had strewn in the way ren
dered our flight slow and difficult Mr.
Smart, although still full of agility,
walked withl difficulty, and in order
not to leave him behind, we were
obliged to stop from time to time.
We proceeded thus for a quarter of
an hour, when a piercing cry from
one of the Indians warned us that
the tigers were upon our scent. We
found ourselves before a bridge of
reeds which some one had thrown
over a torrent. It was a dangerous
passage, but one that it was impor.
tant should be made.
Colson, Fern sad myself crossed
without accideun, but Smart was still
in the middle of it, endeavoring to
preserve his equilibrium, when we
saw the tigers in a neighboring wood.
As soon as they perceived us they
bounded forward, uttering terrific
cries. At this moment Smart reach
ed the end of the bridge; Fern, Col
son, the two guides and myself climb.
ed the highest rocks which were just
before us.
During this time Smart, although
the tigers were close upon him, lost
not his courage, but preserved his
presence of mind. He drew his hunt.
ing-knife from his sheath, and cut the
cords which bound the bridge to the
bank in such a manner as to place,
apparently, an almost an insurmount
able obstacle between our enemies
and himself. Scarcely had he acconm
plished the task when we saw the
tigreass leap toward the torrent,
which she endeavored to cross with a
bound. The muscular strength of the
animal gave way before it reached
the middle of the stream. It fell and
was torn into a thousand pieces upon
the points of the rocks.
The unhappy end of his companion
did not discourage the male, who,
with a vigorous spring attempted to
pass the ravine; but he touched the
baak only with his fore paws. Sus
pended in this manner, he endeav
ored to gain a footing.
At this moment 8mart, who held
his hunting-knife with a firm hand,
plunged it up to the handle in the
animal. But the moaster, coUjcting
his strength, fixed his hind pad upon
a small portion of projecting rock and
succeeded in seising Smart by the
leg. My heroic friend preserved all
his bravery. In order to sustain him
self, he clung to the trunk ofa tree
with his left hand, and again and
again he forced his hunting-knife into
the breast of the tiger.
Fern and myself ran to his aid.
Colson, seising Smart's gun, dealt the
tiger vigorous strokes upon his head,
and the animal loosened his hold and
was preeipitated into the aby .
Poor Smart had fainted. The blood
flowed freely from his wound. The
natives gathered some plants, the ap
plication of which stopped the hemor
rhage.
It was then evening, and we passed
the night in that place an the shelter
of some roeeks, before which the In
dians built a fire in order toikeep"the
ferocious bests at a distance.
The anesday oar guides earned our
unfortoaste tried to the village
where we had spelt the night prece

poor Smart soon expired.
After I had ttendad the funaeral

eaed to leave the place which yodld

irst occasion to return to Europe.
