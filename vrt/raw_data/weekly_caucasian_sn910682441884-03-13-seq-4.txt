glorious reliiroii? Oh, 1 was a gloiions
success f. r Ie Long nnl liis lueu that
they could carry this religion into great
worldly nndertakii'g, all nations aud all
ages to witness.
Another preiit success in this Do Long
expedition was in the overwhelming ex
ample of courage phieh it h.is set tor the
world and for tlw church. Iienieinher
it was not going klt to tight men. It was
not hke t;.,jouien which v. Ucm-tudcil
or Iho "o'di-r"gou's; into battle. It was
a more iiiRicnlt courage, .because r't was
a contest with the dumb elements. The
soldii r w hen in ordinary battle knows it
is possible that the enemy may be
cowardly and I tin, but the icebergs are
never pai'icstruck and they are never
afraid. The soldier know it is po-ihle
that the enemy may be destroyed by a
Hank movement, 'm't the Arctic Ocean
was never flanked. The soldier knows
it Ls possible that the enemy may get out
of nminii!Htiou. but the Arctic always
has enough ice for shot and ice for ;ju;is
aud ice for thunderous borub.'rduient. It
whh coMmge against the dumb element-,
which show no quarter and never sur
render, and lievtr die. In our times,
when God w:nt to give nu example of
courage, he si tids out a Livingstone or a
Stanley into the torrid regions and into
the Arctic a Fi ankli i or a Do Long and
a'l AmMt-r a:id a Collins and all their
gallant crew. I am fo f.l.ul fieie are
giants btiil liviinr men a' ile to conquer
hunger and cold and physical woe, that
they may give the round earth to the
glorious cause of geographical discovery.
We have found at la-t how the woild is
bom.ded. It is Imui.ded on the north
and the south and the ensi and the west
by courace of mau and the greatness of
G od. We want more of that kind of
couraee in our churches. This glorious
example of courage which De I ig aud
his men gave to the world and to the
chip eh made their expedition forever
and forever a magnificent success.
Another success of this polar expedi
tion is in the fact that it has persuaded
the whole worM tluit it is now time to
stop pushing in that direction. It is :
great thi.ig for the world to know when
it has struck the impossible. Never until
now has every reasouuble and enter
prising man been willing to call a halt.

In I'M ho dispatclied the ship
Grand Turk, under ('apt. Jonathan In
g rsoll, to the C.i pe of Good Hot o on a
mercantile reconiioisHance, to discover
the need and capacity of the Eastern
market. She returned in less than a
year with the information sought, was
quickly reloaded, and on the 2s:h of
November, 175, cleared for the Isle of
France, with instructions to proceed
thcni'e to Canton by way of liatavia.
The ship was laden with native products
ti-h, flour, provis'ons, tobacco, spirit
and made a successful voyage, return
ing in June, 177, wiih a cargo of teas,
silks, and nankeens, the first vessel
from New England, if not from America,
to enter into competition with the incor
porated companies of the old world. Her
success seems to have 'electrified the
merchants of Salem, ISostou and New
York, and au eager rivalry for the trade
of the Orient ensued, with the result
that when Mr. D. rhy's ship Astrea en
ten d Canton two years later, ajie found
15 American vessels there taking iu
cargo, four of them belonging to our
merchant, how ver, who had not lveu
slow in improving his advantages as pio
neer. This was nit the only pioneer
work that he did. H,s b:ik Light
Horse, in 17-t, first opened lAmericau
trade with Russia. In 1788 life ship At
lantic first displayed the American hg
at Su;it. Calctitti and Homhay. An
other di. the same in Ham; the third
was the tirt to ..pen trade with Mocha.
In 179i). it is said, his vessels brought
into Salem x.js, 1 pounds ol tea, these
ventures being among the first in the tea
trade.
Too Much Freshness.
Gen. Joseph MoCook, the dark-browed
warrior - Colorado, is relating uue at
his Western exjieriences, which, he ob
serves, taught l.ini the inadviMtbility of
too much fr.'shness. "About a year
ago," says he, "I had a long journey to
take through the wi-dest part of Arizona.
The country wis full of Apaches who
were going about in small bands steal
ing anything they could lay their hands
ou and doing whatever they could in a
general way to make things enthusiastic
for travelers. 1 hat is to say I heard a
good deal about these Apaches, but as I
didn't cee any of them 1 thought it was
t-imply a case ef scare. My elriver was a
quiet Califomiau who didn't say much,
but ran the exeditioii to suit himself.
Every night when it came time to make
camp he wemld turn off at right angles

I said it was a useless expenditure of time.

A Profitable Steamer.
The sale of the steamer Senator for a
coal hulk to New Zealaud finishes the
active career of one of the meM success
ful vessels afloat. She was built at New
York in 18b. and ran fer a short time ou
the E tsteru coast, but during the gold
excitement of California she was sent to
San Francisco, where she arrived in
SeptemU r, 1810. with over five hundred
iaseneers. rvmn alter arriving mere
she was placed on the Sacramento river,
making three trips a yreek, and. with S-V5
cabirt passage and gl-5 for standing room
on eleH'k, she soon paid for herself ten
times over. In f ct, her receipts averaged
close to S20 000 a trip, and for four
months, fully $50,000 a week. She is
known to have carried in this trade, over
one million passengers. She has made
more gold than she could carry aud has
outlived scores of the finest steamers
afloat, which were wrecked or went to

improvement and to the new and more
economical style of craf t, the steam pro

A Washington correspondent :
Much depends oo catching the Speaker'
eve. Strange aa it may appear, a mem
ber in the remote part of the House with
a feeble voice sometime catches the
Speaker' eye, notwithstanding a dozen
otters near the Sreaker are shouting
and gesticulating wildly and doing their
ntmost to attract hia attention. The
recognition is usually made under an
agreement with the Speaker, made,
perhaps, days before. The favored mem-U-r
has a bill io which there may be
millions or not; but reasons there are
hy he shall have the floor at a particu
lar" time. He asks, especially in the
closing hours of the seasion, for unani
mous consent to call up the bill and put
it on its final passage. Amid the rush
and rnmpns memlx-rs are generally
willing to have this done, as it tends to
create an opxrtunity for others. In this
way some of the most important and the
worst legislation tak place.
A gentleman familiar with legislation
by Congress forty years ago relates an
i,!..r..stiiu7 incident It was near the
j c'ose of the session. The nonse of
i Representatives, sitting in the old hall,
was, as usual, in confusioD. Members
' in scores were trying to catch the
! Six-aker's eve for the Wnefit of favorite
bills. Every one waa trying his best,
and nothing" was being done. Our v,-t-eran
recollector, who had the privilege
of the tl xr, met ia the corridor an out-
sid. r deeply concerned for the passage
of a bill for which ho had lalored the
entire session. It had passed the Hecate,
was not specially opposed, and waa
meritorious, as he lielii ved. "I will
vou so much," naming aronndsum
for these days, "if you will
up. lie sai'i. -
11,8 gentleman ng wtarMd to
the nuw.vMnjIagatukia was
momentarily jenin- Seemingly
every memlM qq the floor trying to
er's eye. "Had I" said
of prominence, "a bill for
I cared enough to make the at-
empt, I would get the Speaker to recog
nize me.
"Wrait a moment aud you shall be
gratified. "
The outsider's bill was produced and
placed in the ha d of the eye catching
member. "Mr. Speaker!" waa heard
from his quarter.
"The gentleman from Blank," was the
immediate response. '"
"I ask unanimous consent that the
bill nunjlered blank be put on its pas
sage. It is a worthy bill. We ought t
piss it."
"There being no objection the motion
is carried," said the SjH'aker. "The
Clerk will call the yeas and nays."
The rules were a little different from
what they are now. The roll waa ealkd,
and the bill passed. Going outside, the
promoter meets his anxious friend, who
was wholly ignorant of w hat was going
on. "Your bill ia through and the work
is done."
"Meet me at Corcoran t Riggs's
banking house to-morrew morning at 10
o'clock and I will giv- yon the promised
fee. "
The summons was kept and the money
paid.
After Congress adjourned the promo
ter, meeting the eye-catching member,
said : "How did- it happen that you
caught the Speaker's eye when so many
others were vainiy trying?"
"I had arranged for it days before,
but the intended business having leeu
intrusted to another, w ho was then trying
to have the SjK'.nker reeegiiize him. and
failing every time, I just wished I had a
chance to show those who took the busi
ness from my hands what a mistake they
had made, but I had no bill to do it with.
If I did you any good I am glad. You
mnst have an understanding with the
Speaker in order to catch his eye when
everybody is trying to do it."
A l ion's Intelligence.
The sentinel system of the . crows is
very complete. Their guards display a
remarkable degree of jndgment anil in
telligence. '1 liey will raise a cry for a
man with a gun long before he gets in
range of them, and they are equally
wary of a man who creeps toward them.
But a team may pass cioe by without
disturbing them, and they will even let
a man on foot pass unnoticed if he
hasn't a gun aud goes boldly about his
business. I hail a curious example of
this when. I first begau to study their
habits. I commenced by trying to shoot
them, but though I had passed them
close enough before, I could not get
near them after I began carrying a gun.
I went out with my gun every evening
for weeks. I crept behind fences aud
lay in wait in the bushes, but could
never get a shot at them. One day.
however, I struck upon a plan which I
have since operated very successfully.
I held my gun close to my side, the bar
rel running down the side if my leg,
and walked boldly down the road with
out taking any notice of them. With
their usual disregard for travelers, they
let me pass close up to them, when I
turned suddenly and fired. Now I can
shoot a crow whenever I want to.
It Was No (iood.
There was a Chicago man who found
out that he was not so peculiarly en-
elowed by nature as he hael p".ptjecd.
An inch more than usual woulet pro
verbially be a great eleal on a nose.
This man had it, ud in consequence he
overrated his nasal importance. A test
proved that it des not render him thril
ling to the masses. He is a cigar maker
by trad. Whenever he teok his walks
ab-td he was gazed at in amazement.
"If I am to be looked on as a curiosity,"
he reasoned, "it would be better to make
a lazy living with my abnormal nose."
So he took his big feature to the man
ager of a tt?n-cent museum. "Very
well," was the offer which he received;
"I'll do just the same by yon that I do
by any other new freak. We can't tell
what'll catch on with the public. Yon
can have a place on the platform for a
week. If yon make a failure, I'll give
von five dollars. If von hit 'em, I'll
fix a square, liberal salary." "But
now m l to kuow wneiner
hit 'em?'
the amateur
curiosity asked. "By ftee-
insr whether the folks stop to look at
you. That s the test. iue nose was
not potent. What had been novel in
private life was almost disregarded in a
professional. The man has returned to
his cigar bench.
The Soudan.
The term Soudan is applietl to a
region which includes the whole Nile
basin as far south as the cataract below
Khartoum, and also an indefinite stretch
of country west of that and south of the
Sahara desert. It is well watered and
fertile, and is inhabiteel by several races
more or less negro-like and, on the
borders, by numerous trilies of Arabs.
During the reign of Ismail Pasha it was
brought under Egyptian sway by the
able British snd American generals in
the service of that Prince, prominent
among whom were Sir Samuel Baker,
General Gordon and General Stone.
The slave trade was suppressed, some
systematic efforts were made in agricul
ture, and the annual overflow of the
Nile was rendered harmless by a simple
scientific apparatus.
The country has great capabilities,
bnt no present means of developing
them. The onlv outlet for its products
is across a desert, anc ine oniy way oi
transportation is by camels.

Duchess of Grafton, and the title
created for a mistress of a King will be
borne by a woman of the town.
The Duke of Grafton was made
Knight of the Garter a little over a year
ago. He succeeded his brother, who
died iu the spring of 18S2. The late
Duke was sixty-three years old and was

received a fatal wound while storming
the city of Cork in 1690. The third
duke was an eminent statesman, who
was Secretary of State and Prime Min
ister of Engia- d in 1771. The present
duke was born in 1821.
Advice to a Young Man.
No, son, you can't make up lost time.
You can only do the work of one life
rime iu a iife time. Yes, you may write
six columns te Vay because you neglect
ed to write your three yesterday, but
you've discounted one day somewh?re
about 35 or 40 years further ou iu ihe
account You have about 70 year
placed to your credit. Every day yon
use or misuse is charged to you, and you
can't get credit for two days to-morrow,
if you waste to-day. Au engine three
hours behind time, may reach the termi
nal station on time, by ruunicg fifty
miles au hour iujtcad of thirty, her
schedule time. But when she gets in,
she requires nearly all, or quite a'l, or
many hours more than the three honrs
she made up, in leing doctored for the
strain on nerves aud sinews of steel,
by reason of the extra effort and speeel.
There's something prung here, a bolt
started there, a journal burned out
somewhere, she limps away to the round
house, ovtrheated, rattier g in half a
dozen placets, covered with grease and
dust aud grime, with an engineer growl
ing in his cab and a mas:er machinest
grumbling as he walks around her.
That's the way you "make np time,"
my boy. Believe me, you'll last longer
if you run on schedule time day by day.
You won't make people yell and hurrah
aud you won't make such a grand,
thunderbolt kiud of a show as if you
would go botmiiug through the way
stations, swinging along like a cyclone.
But you'll go waltzing into the round
bouse in supremely better style, with
your steel bright and your brass shii.ing,
and not a spot on your jacket, and reaely
to throw another hundred miles over
your shouller the minute the gong
strikes. Just make vonr regular time,
day by day, ray boy. The superintend
eut knows what you cau do and what he
wants you to do, and you can't treat
yourself better nor please him more,
thau to do exactly that much, without a
mile wasted or a minute to spare.

Horace Greeley's Bojhood.
Ben. P. Poore, iu his Reminiscences,
thus speaks of Horace Greeley: Horace
Greeley's personal appearance was
always a subject of remark from his
boyhood. Roilic C. uallary, a member
of Couress from Vermont, who was an
able chan'-pion of the American bystem.
used te narrate a visit of his to the
printing office of a country newspaper
at I'oultney, t., bis place of residence.
His attention was attracted to a young
compositor, who was rather awtwaraiy
"sticking tvpes," aud who, though fnU
grown, was evidently the youngest ap
prentice in tne othce. tiis legs ran a
good deal more than "a feet" through
his pantaloons, the sleeves of his coat
scarcely reached below his elbows, his
hair was very white and flaxen, and he
was, on the whole, in the aggregate,
taken separately and together, the
greenest looking specimen of humanity
we ever looked at, anel this is saying a
good deal, for "we keeps a looking
glass." "That boy," said Mr. Mallary,
"will make a remarkable man; 1 can't
hold an argument with him on Masonry
or anything else connected with politics."
As Mr. Mallary was considered one of
the ablest men in Congress, his remark
canned me some surprise; und we not
only "made a note ef," but took another
lexk at the "devil' (printer's we mean),
and could not bnt trace in the expansive
forehead "a mind formed in nature's
finest mould and, wrought for immor
tality." It was vevrs afterward that we
became aware of the fact that th.it boy
was Horace Greelev.
Ia a Bear Trap.
The Janitor of tue Lime-Kiln Club
announced at the last meeting, that
some evil-minded person who had
sought to ente-r Partidise Hall the even
iDg before by way o?' the side doeir, bad
put his foot in a ber-trap waiting there
for just such an emergency. The jaws
and teeth of the trj were stained with
blood, proving that he fellow had been
considerably aston hed in his mad ca
reer. He had manured to pry open the
aws and drag himself away, leaving
nothing behind by which his identity
could be suspected. ,
A vote of thanks was given the Janitor
for hia vigilance, and the Secretary was
instructed to advertise for information
concerning the victim; If he will come
forward aud state how it feels to step
suddenly into a bear-trup, the club will
present him with a recipe for removing
the marks left bv the tettn.

The Judge Flushed.
A prominent Jndge and State Senator,
who with his family was among the
friends of Mrs. Cady Stanton, still felt
himself called upon publicly to oppose
the married woman's property bills which
were carried through our legislature by
the efforts of Mrs. Stanton and her co
laborers. The judge made several
speeches against tne bills, declaring that
if wives were permitted a separate estate
from their husbands it would cause dis
sensions in families.
The bills were passed despite the elo
quent advocate's opposition. A few
months later Mrs. Stanton met the judge
iu New York. She held out her hand
with a mournful expression of face,
though, I doubt not, there was a twinkle
of fun in her kind, bine eyes. "Permit
me to condole withyou," she said. "Con
dole with me!" exclaimed the judge;
"on what ?" "On the great unhappiuess
in your family the unfortunate differ
ence between your wife and yourself."
The judge Unshed, thinking that some
busybody had spread slanderous tales
concerning him. . "Why, what have you
heard?" he demanded angrily. "Noth
ing, nothing whatoyer," replied Mrs.
Stanton; "only, as j-on predicted such
dire family quarrels as Uie result of pass
ing the property bills, and as they have
since passed, I supposed yon and your
wile must be on tne eve of divorce,
The good judge laughed heartily at the
practical joke. "You were right," he
said; "I do not think anv trouble will
come from those new laws."
Texas Fence Cutters.
A funny phass of the late fence-cut ting
fcpecial session of the Texas Legislature is
revealed in the fact now patent, tiat the
Legislature really meant o do as little as
ptssible to meet the difficulties that for
so many months have disturbed the
State. While the neb, ranchmen and
large land-owners heU full control
of the Senate, the smaller land-owners
and mith them the fence-cutters, had
the House. So when the House
require!, -fjit land-owners should put
gates in their fences every three miles so
as to let fie little men get to mill and to
water, tie Senate made tue penalty for
not denig so as light as possible. In
fact, few of the legislators seemed to care
so much about the fences as to be on
the fenoe themselves. The amount ap-
propnatee for carrying ont the few
laws mad: ia ridiculout 'y insufficient It
is now stid that the Legislature was
wholly unprepared to e'al with the sub
ject and: that popular sentiment and
opinion wire neither fairly presented nor
representet. Things generally will wait
probably ill tbe next N ovember elec
tion, when', the fence question will be

Whenever an Abchasian is drowned
his frieudu search carefully for the
Ixxly, but, if this is not found, they pro
ceed to capture the soul of the deceased,
a measure which then has become a
matter of importance.
A goatskin bag is sprinkled with water
and placed with its mouth, which is
stretched open over a hoop, looking
toward the river, near the place where
tbe man is supiiosed to have been
drowned. Two cords are stretched from
the spot across the river, as a bridge on
which the soul can come over. Vessels
containing food and drink are set around
the skin, and the friends of the deceased
come and eat quietly, while a song is
6ung with instrumental accompani
ments.
The soul, it is believed, is attracted
ov the ceremonies, comes over on the
bridge that is laid for it, and goes into
the trap. As soon as it has entered
that is, when the bag is inflUed by the
breeze the opening is quietly closed,
and the bag is taken up to the burial
place, where a grave has already been
prepared. The bag is held with the
owning to the grave, the strings are
untied, and the bag is squeezed into
'.he grave, and the burial is afterward
completed.
This rite is considered of equivalent
value with the burial of the body, and
'.he grave is treateel with the same honor
as if the body were really within it

Gov. Duval, of Florida, was the son
of a poor Virginian, a stern, eirong, tac
iturn man. The boy was a huge youth
of 15. At the cabin fire, at bed time,
according to the custem of putting on a
back log, the old man said, between the
whiffs of his silent pipe :
" Tab, go out and bring in that gum
back log and put it on the fire."
Tab went cut and surveyed the log.
He knew it as of no use explaining
that it W8S too heavy, nor prudent for
him to return without having it on his
shoulder. His little sister, passing, was
not surprised that he requested her to
bring out the gun and powder horn, as
a possum or coon might have passed, or
the brother might have seen bear signs.
She brought the gun and Tab started.

see the old folks who had long since
given him np for dead. Entering the
little cabin door near bed time, he saw
the identical gam log. He shouldered
it, pulled the latch t-tring and with nis
load stood before the old man, pipe in
