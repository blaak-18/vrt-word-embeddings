posed to the present corrupt rule of!
negro Radicalism in Louisiana, are
cordially and earnestly reguested

Rector.
The Crops.
The rains for the last two weeks
have been partial, and many plan
ters complain ol the drought that is
injuriug the younger corn, and re
tarding the growth of course. We
are gratified to know that there is
fess complaint this season, about
bad crops, than has been since the
war. The prospect for cotton, cane
and corn crops, are exceedingly en
couraging, and unless there is a
severe drought, a full crop is ex
pected. The catapillar has made
its appearance, but in small num
bers, and in many places none at
all can be seen. Paris Green and
Arsenic is in great demand, and
every one who is able, is laying in
a supply necessary to destroy the
worm so soon as it commences its
ravages. The sprinkling process
will be most generally adopted
although, the best informed men
who have made experiments in
both, prefer to follow the formular
of Royall, and apply the mixture
by sifting. If the application of the
mixtnre is commenced in time, we
have no doubt of a pesfcct success,
in its complete destruction of the
insect.
Where Paris Green and flower
can not be obtained, Arsenic appli
ed will prove beneficial. One
pound of Arsenic, dissolved in for
ty or fifty gallons of water, and
sprinkled on the cotton plant, is
çaid to do almost as well as the
Paris Green—and it is about one
tenth of the cost, o The time of
making the application of any of
the remedies is a question of great
importance; as in several instances
last year, the remedy was applied
at too lato a day, when the last
crop of the catapillar had commenc
ed its work of destruction.. The
poison though effective could not
prevent the destruction of the crop.
iy Oar thanks for papers are
due and are heartily tendered to
Capt. Dick Sinnot, for pictorials
and to Joe Jofirion for files of pa
pers from everywhere. Both these
gentlemen, the one CagJ. and the
other Clerk of the fleet never forget
us, and we are duly grateful. We
«wear by the banner that hangs
from their Jackstaff, and will stick
io them forever.
OUB POSITION,
pends the success or defeat of
honest and intelligent white people
0 j ol the next oleo
We do not intend to reflect npon
the members of the Central Commit
tee for no doubt they were actuated
by the purest and most patriotic in
tentions. Their action was unfortu
nate, as it has produced discord in
the ranks of the white people amcng
whom nothing but harmony should
exist. We have no war to wage
against the Committee, no opposition
to nrge against Democrats, either in
the country, or New Orleans. In op
position to the call for a Convention
we do so, on the broad ground, that
it has not and. will not accomplish
the object that was intended, that of
uniting the white people under the
Democratic standard. From almost
every parish in the State, and in the
city of New Orleans itself, the call
has not met with any enthusiastic re
sponse, and it is very evident with
the opposition of the country press,
that the ConventioiPwill fail to accom
plish desired results.* With these
facts, staring us in the face, with the
negröes united into black leagues,
and the Radical party with a perfect
organization in every parish, what is
the proper course to be pursued ?—
This is a serious and important ques
tion, upon the solution of which de
the
tion. We give to the supporters of
the Democratic, the Independent and
White Man's parties the same credit
for patriotism, and the same desire
to harmonize all elements necessary
for success in the coming campaign
and there is no doubt that this union
of all could be accomplished by
Convention, that is not partisan in
character that would assemble at
some place in the country. Will not
the Democracy of New Orleans, in
spirit of conciliation, advise the De
mocratic Central Committee, to
change the time and place, of their
Convention, and instruct the Demo
cratic Committees in the parishes
where one exists, to join all their or
ganizations in a call for a mass meet
ing of the people—opposed to Radi
calism? We do not wish separate
primary meetings, in the parishes,
nor separate and distinct conventions
in the State. The country is both
unable and unwilling to go to the
same expense, and trouble, in atten
ding Conventions as it did in 1872,
that memorable year of political dis
sension, as well as of Conventions in
Louisiana.
We have the history of that year
before us, let us profit by it ; and be
fore it is too late rectify the errors
that have been committed. The coun
try is determined to be beard and re
cognised in the interest of the White
Man's Party, and will have a voice in
the adoption of a name and platform ;
which will not confine it to a strictly
party contest, when the issues are
purely local. Let each parish deter
mine for itself the best policy to be
pursued, hold public meetings and
speak out at once, and whatever may
be the decision ot the majority, let
the minority abide by it.
The Caucasian will continue to ad -
vocate the cause of the White Man's
Party in the parish of Rapides. We
will not waver or change in the
course pursued by it, from the be
ginning, and will stick to the White
Man's Party until the people ir^their
sovereign capacity, on the 8th of
August next, shall determine upon a
different party and policy. Our ban
ner has been nailed to the mast-head
and there it shall wave until it is
called down by the voice of the
people.

T he M ass M eeting and B arbacce.
—We have been requested to give
notice that there will be a Barbecue
and Public Meeting at Dyers & Dor
set's Store, between Spring Creek and
Calcasieu River, on the 31st of July.
The Barbecue is given by the citi
zens in that section of the country in
the interest of the White Man's Par
ty. . Everybody is invited to attend.
Well known speakers will be present.
BP* Dr. G. W. Laney, oar worthy Dent
ist, has been absent from his home some
time on business connected with bis pro
fession. His friends as well as those who
need his professional services, will be glad
to hear of his return. He can be fonnd at
all times in his office.
tW" Remember the Mass Meeting on the
8th io«t. It is the White MtoVcause.
The Conservative Party.
We are informed that among oth
er matters which will come before
the Mass meeting, then* will be
made a proposition to adopt the
name " Conservative " as the party
name. We are informed also that
it is proposed and will most proba
bly be adopted, to call the ticket
and platform put forth by the Con
vention called by the Democratic
State Central Committee, the "Con
servative Ticket." All we have to
say about the matter is, that the
gentleman favoring that name in
this Parish are some of our most
patriotic and liberal minded citi
zens and their names are a guaran
ty of its respectability. As a com
promise between Democracy aud
White Man's Party thi* name
may do.
We don't intend to give up the
White Man's Party until the peo
ple have spoken upon it, but we
can urge no particular objection to
the name Conservative, and will
fight our best fight under whatever
name they may adopt. We think
this should be the feeling of every
one, aud we are certain that it is
the only teeling which will avoid
dissensions and discord.
Personal feeling must give way
to our common good. The object
ot the movers in this new party is
not to create divisions, but to re
concile theui, and we are assured
and believe that these gentlemen
are actuated by only patriotic mo
tives and do not propose or intend
that their move shall bring about
any division. They bave a right
to i 'heir opinions, and we cheerfully
accord them that right. We think
the name " White Man's Party " is
the best. These are question for
the mass meeting.
The Caucasian and the Dash
er .—Hold on friend Democrat ! If
yoii mean by yonr article in your
"dashes" that we have abandoned
the White Man's Party, we emphat
ically answer—No ! We have not
abandoned nor do we intend to
abandon one iota of the principles
and policy we have advocated un
til the people in Mass Meeting on
the 8th of August shall have decid
ed for themselves what they will do.
Oh ; No ! We don't give up that
easy, nor not quite so near the end
of the mile heat. We will run that
through on our same track any
way. No, Sir! We have not given
up.
If you mean, as you say a little
further on, that Democracy, simon
pure Democracy is obeying the
voice of the people when they shall
have spoken, and consists in leav
ing all these questions fur them to
settle,.then we stand together to a
certainty; lor there is just where
we stand exactly. You say that
" vox populi vox dei, v is Democracy,
then that same sentence defines our
position exactly.
T he Sabine .—This neat and ti
dy Steamer, in the place of the
Bart Able and under the command
of our big hearted commander of
the lower Red River fleet, Capt.
Dick Sinnot, came to the wharf
about one o'clock on Monday, and
left us on Wednesday, only an hour
or two behind time. The Sabine
is as nice and comfortable a low
water boat as we could wish, and
travelers ond shippers will consult
their interests by patronizing her.
We miss the smiling face°of Geo.
Hamilton, but his place for this trip,
we know not whether permanently
or not, is able and acceptably filled
by our courteons and obliging
young steamboat friend of other
days, Joe Joffrion. We were not
certain whether it was Ben Kay or
not, we saw in the pilot house, but
found out that it was, minus his
moustache. Tom Dowty and Red
man were on band as pleasant aud
agreeable as ever. Bully for the
Sabine !

do not receive their papers either
by the carrier or mail, will confer a
favor upon us by notifying our
Business Manager. Mistakes and
omissions sometimes happen with
all our care, and we are always
anxioas to remedy them as soon as
possible.
An Outrageons Assassination.
We are pained to announce that
on the evening of hist Saturday,
Mr. Dennis Sullivan, of this Parish
was shot and instantly killed by an
assassin supposed to be a negro.
He had just returned home from
Alexandria, and was putting his
horse in a small pasture near his
house, be was fired upon by some
one concealed in the bushes close
by, several buckshot entering bis
head, killing him instautly. The
assassin has not yet been discover
ed, but suspicion points strongly to
a negro, who has been heard to
make threats against his lite. We
have nothing to say of Mr. Sulli
van's character, or lite. The grave
hides all his°faults. The veil Of
christian charity covers all his de
fects. But ot his base assassina
tion^ by a negro we have this to say.
That no matter how bad a man
he may have beetff bad he been the
worst man living, that could be no
excuse for his being killed by a
cowardly assassin, hiding in the
bushes. No word of ours shall ever
excuse or palliate any such base
aud cowardly way of protecting
one's self or of avenging any wrong.
And wo tell the negroes that they
can not take the law in their own
bauds, aud thus cowardly murder
any man, no matter, who he is. The
perpetrator of this outrage, upon
the law and humanity should be
summarily dealt with and doubt
less will be, if caught. Such things
must not and shall not be done
with impunity. We condemn the
act as cowardly, base, inhuman and
utterly unjustifiable, and we call
on the officers of the law to take
the proper steps to eaten the mur
derer. What are you doing Mr.
Sheriff and Mr. District Attorney
pro tempore ? We don't intend to
let this matter drop and unless vig
orous steps are taken to catch the
assassin, we will recur to it again.
T he R apides A gricultural F air A s
sociation .—The Board of Directors of
this Association met at their office on
Saturday last and perfected all the ar
rangements for building additional
houses and making important and
needed changes in the arrangements
for the next Fair in October. Our
double column advertisement sets
forth some of the main features, and
by the first of August, or a few days
thereafter, wo will have the first iu
stallment of four thousand pamphlet
programmes ready to tnrn over to
them for distribution. The Lottery
Tickets will also be ready by that
time aud the active work of prepara
tion will begin in earnest.
Let every one in Rapides make
something, enter something. or do
something for the Fair to make it a
success. It is intended to build up
and foster all kinds of industries in
the parish, and everybody should
feel themselres under an obligation
to assist in furthering and promoting
the enterprise. We bespeak for the
Association the active co-operation of
everybody in Rapides, and are sure
that they will not disappoint us.
BP The Caucasian force are uu
der obligations to their genial and
kind young friend, John P. Jones,
for a present of the finest water
melon that has conge to light this
season. It was a hot, sultry day
when Paul brought it, aud we
did'nt know which to admire most
his kindness aud "generosity in
bringing it or the size, beauty and
exquisite taste of the watermelon.
Such remembrances from friends,
.are the only bright spots in the
waste of trouble and bother in a
printer'8life, and they know how to
hold such friends as Panl " to mem
ory odear." Many thanks Mr.
«tones! We will remember you
kindly, and put your name high up
in the list of the friends ol the
printer.

Add this to the $21,000 rail road
tax and the tax becomes $31,500 in
greenbacks. Of this snppose the
rail roai does pay one third, or
$10,500, it leaves us $21,000 in
greenbacks as onr yearly tax. It
either case we double our preseut
rate of taxation. The Democrat
errs in placing our parish paper tax
upon an equality with the-green
back rail road tax.
Again —It is a gratuitous assump
tion that the rail road would pay
& of the taxes. They would have

Ilie assessment of the valuatiou ot
the rail road property in the parish
and they would be far Iroui put
ting it down at any such figures as
$1,320,000. Nor could we depend
upon their paying anything, for it
is an easy matter to get the Kana
roo Legislature of Louisiana to do
anything when you pay them for it,
and these rail road gentlemen
would doubtless pay them to pass
an amendment to the charter ex
empting them from the payment of
par;sb taxes and then where would
be the J of the tax they were to pay 1
That section of their charter is a
bait to catch gudgeons. The Levee
Company affords us an illustration.
And thirdly— The calculation of
the Democrat purposely leaves out
tlie whole question of the payment
of the piincipal. This is $300,000.
Divide this amount by 20 and we
have for a quotient, $15,000 per
year that we would have to pay.
As to leaving this question to pos
terity, the postion is absurd and
childish. Many of us hope to live
much longer than that and it is our
concern. We would have to have
a sinking fund and could not put it
off until thoeud of the twenty .years
„
if wo would. Now add this $15.000

twen'y years. Now to arrive at the
correct figures we must separate
the railroad tax from the parish
tax proper. We will sa> with the
Democrat that the parish tax prop
er is $21 000 per year in parish pa
paper. This reduced to its enrren
cy value is $10,500. We have just
seen above that our whole yearly
tax in greenbacks, after deducting
the J it is supposed that the rail
road would pay, would be $31,000,

of the Association have been liber

ed sufficient to put up the fence
and to do something towards the

more uionoy to perfect all the im

their success is now assured, the
Association confidently appeals to
the people of Rapides, to take more
stock, and enable it to make the
stock, and enable it to make the

more towards bringing ns a white
