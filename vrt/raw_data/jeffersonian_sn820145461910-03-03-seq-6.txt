ward usurping the rights of State courts, and
the police powers of the States.
We will watch the progress of the affair.
If these men are proven guilty
of violating the provisions of
the interstate commerce law, or
some other Federal measure,
what will be done with them?
Will the Government issue a
polite little order to “dissolve”
the “Night-Rider Trust” and
affix a clause to the order
showing the night-riders how
to proceed with their enter
prise just the same as before?
Well, hardly. The list of names
of the men indicted mean as
little to the reader outside of
their particular locality as a
string of John Does and Rich
ard Roes. Therefore, they are
not “prominent citizens” in the
sense that the great calcium
light of publicity has been shed,
upon their doings for lo! these
several decades. They are not
accustomed, we venture to pre
sume, to being asked to the
White House to consult with
the President and Attorney-
General as to the best method
of “controlling” their monop
oly, or how to kill competition
without “restraining trade" as
are the Morgans and Hills and
Rockefellers and other estima
ble gentlemen whose expert ad
vice is eagerly devoured by the
Cabinet clique, the Senatorial
powers.
No, Samantha, if these par
ticular twelve individuals have
been guilty of foul conspiracy
to defeat the ends of the To
bacco Trust, they will get it in
the neck, good and plenty.
Whenever the sinned-against
go after the sinners, it is all
up with the former. The law
and the precedent are invaria
bly that way. When a corpor
ation defends itself by force of
arms against striking employ
ees, it can call to its aid the
State and the Nation. When
mere producers, reduced to
beggary, protests against a mo-
nopoly which insolently parcels ont districts
and fixes the price of the only thing they
have to sell, it is a matter for condign pun
ishment. If Wickersham lacks any energy in
prosecuting the Sugar Trust, the Tobacco
Trust, the Standard Oil or the cold-storage
assassins, he’ll make it up by vigorous perse
cution of the men of the tobacco region who
have had spunk enough to defy and nearly
to defeat the demands of a greed that was en
slaving them.
The Beef Trust has been indicted in Jersey
City, and the Milk Trust in New York. All

under the old common law maxim that “It is

a crime to do a lawful thing in an unlawful
manner, or to do an unlawful thing in a law
ful manner.”
Thunders and lightnings are breathed
against the conspirators, and they are threat
ened with extradition if they attempt to
hamper the proceedings or defeat justice by
sailing away gaily in their yachts, or sojourn
ing in some foreign clime until the thing
“blows over”.
We will watch the progress of THIS affair,
as well as the result of the night-rider prose
cutions.
Meanwhile, the Beef Barons have gently
elevated the price of meat another cent or two
per pound, and meat, eggs and milk sweetly
repose on the same ice that has kept them,
awaiting the moment of sufficient valuation,
for the past unknown period. Some of the
eggs must be in their teens, at least.
Dr. Wiley, of Pure Food fame, has been
called upon to render his services in the ease.
If he doesn’t do so in an able and illumina
ting manner, he will much belie his record
and ability.
As soon as this stuff has been taken out of
cold-storage and subjected to atmosphere at
any ordinary temperature, it decays far more
rapidly than does fresh meat. Fortunately,
it is cooked before consumption, or the coun-
try would simply be devastated by ptomaine
poisoning, and under the best preparation
food kept in such manner is a menace to life
and health. Few could force down a “cold
storage egg” if it were not cooked in some
way that conceals its nauseating flavor, and
when food is instinctively rejected, it is an
infallible sign that Nature knows it is unfit
aliment.
The Beef Trust constitutes a gigantic
haustion or terror is no indication that the
confessor had any previous knowledge of, or
part in it.
All cases of “third degree” are based
upon tormenting somebody to the verge of
collapse, either through long questioning,
lack of food and sleep, a suffocating con
finement in some dark cell, or perhaps
worse, God only knows! and then springing
something calculated to bring a violent shock.
If the victim “breaks down and confesses”
his doom is sealed. A stolid criminal might
not break down, but an innocent and nervous
individual would almost certainly do so.
If our courts cannot dispense with this
means of proving guilt, we had better go
back to the rack and pincers.
HERDER MACHINE and
hanging is far too good for the
directors who have deliberately
starved and poisoned a multi
tude of their fellow-beings.
A bill has been introduced
in the Senate providing for an
investigation into
A Needed “the practice of
Investi- administering what
gation. is known as the
third degree or-
deal by officers of the law for
the purpose of extorting state
ments and confessions from
those charged with crime.”
It is indeed time that atten
tion were widely called to the
increasing frequency and com
placency with which the “third
degree” barbarities are men
tioned. The thing has appar
ently been one of those up
growths of illegal practices
which flourish because nobody
has made it his or her parties
lar business to subdue. The
Jeffersonian and other pa
pers have condemned it, but
people are all SO busy with
their little, tiddledy-winky af
fairs that they never resist the
beginning of a thing until it is
fastened upon them like an ill
favored barnacle.
It is getting to be so that
every form of mental or physi
cal torture is resorted to bv
self-appointed inquisitors (po
licemen, and such like petty
officers anxious to prove the
suspect guilty) to extort a con
fession.
The effect of a nervous shock
upon a sensitive person is
something that cannot be pre
dicted by the most skilled neu
rologist, and that a crime is
confessed at a moment of ex-
