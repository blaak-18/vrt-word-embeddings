celebrated temple of Delphos with

So then it happened one day that
a farmer having come to Kennes,
for some bargain concluded after
his business was finished, that as
lie still had some hours of leisure,
it would be well for him to employ
them in consulting a lawyer.
lie had heui'd M. Potier de la
i tarmondalo spokeu of, whoso rep
utation was so great that a cause
was deemed already gained, if it
were supported by his opinion.
The peasant asked his address and
repaired to him. in St. George street.
The clionts were numerous, and
Bernard had to wait a long time;
id, last his -time çamo and he was
introduced. J\f. J'otjer de la Ger
mondain sigued to him to e sit down,
laid his spectacles on tho desk, and
asked him what he came for.
"Faith! Mr. Advocate" Naid the
l'armer, twisting his hat, "I have
heard so ntcch.talk of you that, as
I was here, I I bought Î would take
the chance of consulting you."
"I thank you for your confidence,
my friend," said Mr. Oermondale;
''but you have some suit, I sup
poso !"
"Suit 1 I abominate" them, and
Peter Bernard never had a word
with anybody." #
"Then it is settlement, a family
division Î"
"Excuso me, Mr. Advocate ; ray
family and myself have never had
any division to^nake, seeing wo eat
<»ut of the same cupboard, as they
say."
"I concerns some purchase or sale
then r
"Ohj no indeed ! I ain not rich,
enough to buy, nor yet poor enough
to hnvo tO. sellout."
8 "But what do you want with mo,
then F asked the astonished law
®
yor.
"Gli, well ! I have told you, sir"
replied Bertrand, with a loud, Gm
barrassed laugh. "1 want oplu
ijoit—jor money—understand—bo
(ïaiiHO 1. nm here, at Kennes, and
must profit by the occasion."
M. Gornioudale smiled, took a
pen and paper, ami asked his name.
"Peter Bernard" said . ho, happy

The,lawyer wrote two lines, fold
h <[ '.lie paper and handed it to his
•itrmigo. client.

Ber:.anl; "oh, well that's lucky; one

* VVJ&en lie retched homo it was al

linwl li Im, and he wont in determin
ed tb réxt/llowever, Iiis hay bad
i»eeh cut.(wo days before,, and was
completely dry. One of hi« boys
catiMrto ask if ho must bring it in.
"Tills evening F interrupted the
IhmiorVi wifp, wfiô had joined her
liuhbaud; "it Would be a shame to
go to work so late, when you could
do it to-morrow without tiring your*
Self.* The bey remarked that the
Weather might change, that the
teasus were ready ami the bauds un
employed. The wife replied that
the wind was from a good quarter,
and that the night would interrupt
them. o
Bernard, listening to both sides,
did not know how to decide, when
middchly he recollected the lawyer's
paper.
'?Sto|> u «minute," cried hu, "I
have got an 'opinion' here; it is
from a f'amouH man, and cost me
three francs. That ought to settle
it. Let us see, Therese, toll us
what it says, you who can road all
writing !"
The wife look the paper'and read
hesitatingly; fliese two lines: " Nev
er put off. tül to-morrow what you
can do to-day*
There it is," cried Bornard
struck as with a ray of light. "Come,
get the carts, quick! Girls, boys,
let us got in the hay."
Still his wife tried to make objec
tions, but lie. declared that people
did hot "buy an opinion for three
francs for nothing, and they must
follow the lawyer's advich. Jle him
self set the example at the head of
his laborers, aud worked until all
the hay was got in. The event
seemed sent on purpose to prove the
wisdom of his conduct, for the
woathcr chnngod (luring tho night,
a sudden storm burst overlhe viU
läge, and the next day at daWn
they perceived the river overflowing
the meadows and carrying off tho
new moan hay. Tho harvests of all
the neighboring farmers wore com
pletely destroyed. Bernard aJone
lost nothing. This first experience
gavo hiin such faith iu the lawyer's
opinic.1 that from tbi|t day he took
it for tho rule of Ris conduct', and
becayio, thanks to his regularity
and diligence, one of the richest
farmers Of the country. lie never
forgot, either,. the advice M. Gor
moudalo had rendered him, but
sent him every year from gratitude,
couple of his fattest fowls, and
was accustomed to say to his neigh
bors, whenever they spoke of law
yers, that "after the laws of God
aud the Church,'the most profita
bio thing in the world was a law
