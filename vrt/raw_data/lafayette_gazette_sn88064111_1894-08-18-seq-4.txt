"Atnnoyed at your logic, most like
ly," said my friend, a bright young
matron, as she threaded her needle.
"'My husband is not a tyrant, Miss
Kent."
"I am glad 'you are satisfied," was
the laconic reply.
-t' was wtient by'theqDaression of
the dressmatke''s face 'that she had
formed her own opinion about my
friend's husband, and was quite com
petent to form and express an opinion
on any subjedt; Miss Kent was a little
wvoman, fair as a girl and plump as 'a
robin. She wasn't ashamed to own
that she was forty years old andanold
maid. She liad earned her own living
most of her life, and was proud of it.
She was a good nurse, a faithful
friend and a jolly companion; but
stroke her the wrong way, and you'd
wish you hadn't in much shorter time
than it takes to write it. Her views
on all subjects wrere strikingly orig
inal. andot to be .ombated. -
"'What' are you ging to 4-d6 when
you are old?" persisted the mistress of
the establishment.
"What other folks do, I suppose."
"But you can't work forever."
"'Can't day that I want to."
"::Now, MTlisn Kent, a husband with
means, a kind, intelligent man-"
"I don't want any man. I tell, you,
Mrs. Carlisle, I wouldn't marry the
best man living, if he was as rich as
Croesus and would die if I didn't have
him. Now, if you have exhausted the
marriage question, I should like to try
on your dress."
There was something behind all this.
I knew well. My friend's eyes danced
with fun, and as Miss Kent fitted the
waist she threw me a letter from the
bureau.
"Read that," she said, with a know
ing look. "It may amuse you."
"MY DEAR JEsxxE: I shall be delighted to
spend a nponth with you and your husband.
There must. however, be one stipulation about
my visit-you must say no more about mar
riage. I shall never be foolish again. Twenty
years ago to-day I wrecked my whole life.
(:Better embark in a new ship,' hadn't he?' put
in Jennie. sotto voice.) So unsuitable was this
marriage. so utterly and entirely .wretched
have been its consequence, that I am forced to
believe the marriage institution a mistake; So,
for the last time, let me assure you that I
wouldn't marry the best woman that ever lived.
if by so doing I could save her life. Your old
cousin. MAUK LANSING."
"Rich, isn't he?" aid Jennie, and
then pointed to the chubby little figure
whose back happened to be turned.
I shook my head and laughed.
"You'll see," said the incorrigible.
"See what?" inquired Miss Kent,
quite unaware of the pantomime.
"That parties which are chemically
attracted will unite. Of course, an
alkali and an acid. Don't you think
thissleeve a little too long, Miss Kent?'
"Not after the seam is off. But
what were you saying, Mrs. Carlisle?
The other day, at Prof. Boynton's I
saw some wonderful experiments."
"And did they succeed?" inquired
Jennie, demurely.
"Beautifully."
"So will mine. I never yet botched.
a job in my life."
"I don't quite understand you," re
plied Miss Kent, perplexed.
"No? I always grow scientific when
thlking about marriage, my dear."
"Bother!" was all the little woman
said, but the tone was much better
natured than I expected.
The next week Cousin Mark araived,
and I liked him at once. An unhappy
marriage would have been the last
thing thought of in connection with
that gentleman. He had accepted the
situation like a man, Jennie told me,
and for fifteen years carried a load of
misery that few could have endured.
Death came to him at last. and now
the poor fellow actually believed him
self an'.alienfrom domestic happiness.
Singularly as it may appear, Cousin
Mark was the embodiment of good
health and good nature; fifty, perhaps,
though he didn't look it, and as rotund
and as fresh in his way as the little
dressmaker was in hers. As 1 looked
at him I defied anybody to see one and
not be reminaed of the other. True,
he had more of the polish which comes
from travel and adaptation to different
classes and individuals, but he was not
a whit more intelligent by nature than
the bright little woman whom Jennie
determined he should marry.
"I was surprised you should think it
necessary to caution me about that,
Cousin Mark." cooed the plotter, as
sihe stood by his side looking out of the
window. "The idea of my being so
ridiculous!" and in the same breath,
with a winjk at me: "Cofhe, let us go to
my sitting-room. We are at work there,
but it won't make any difference to
you, will it?"
Of course, Cousin Mark said: "No,"
promptly,eas innocent as .a dove about
the trap being laid for him.
"This is my cousin, Mr. Lansing,
Miss Kent."
MIr. Lansing bowed politely and Miss
KRentrose,dropped lier scissors, blushed
aid sat down again. Cousin Mark
picked up the refractory implements
and then Mrs. Carlisle proceeded, with
rare caution and tact, to her labor of
love. Cousin Mark, at her request,
read aloud an article from the Ecience
Monthly, drawing Miss Kent into the
discussion as deftly as wass ever a fly
drawn into the web of a spider.
"lybho is that lady, Jennie?" Cousin
Mark inquired in the evening.
'' htnmeaiaMiss Kl~ t?" said Jennie,

Sldp-e I aive' ka~ob her toi-brfi Rg

me now. - Why?"
"Sh'e seems uncommonly well posted
for a woimp."a
Under an~rother cirenuistances NMr.
Carlisle would have resented this, but
now she only queried: "Do you think
so?5" and that ended it.
Two or three invitations to the sewr
uag-room wee quite sauelent to make
Cousin Mark at home there, and after
a week he become familiar enough to
say:
"If you are not too busy, I should
like to read you this article."
" Oh, I'm never too busy to be read

did she give them a chance to be alone
together. Her plans weri not o be de
stroyed by premature confidence until
the very evening preceding Cousin
Mark's departure for California. Then
Miss Kent was very demurely asked
to remain and keep an eye on Master
Carlisle, whom the fond mother did
not like to leave quite alone with his
nurse.
"We are compelled to be gone a
couple of hours," she said, "but Cousin
Mark will read to youst won't you,
cousin?"
"Certainly, it Miss Kent would like
it," replied the gentleman.
The infant Carlisle, thanks to good
management, was never awake in the
evening, so the victims of this matri
monial speculation would have plenty
of time. The back parlor was the
room most in use during.the evening,
and out of that room was a large closet,
with a large blind elevator, and out of
this closet a door leading to the stoop
and garden. Imagine my surprise
when I was told that Mr. Carlisle was
going to the lodge, and that we, after
profuse warnings about thy baby and
promises not to be gone too long, were
to proceed to this closet overlooking
the back parlor by way of the back
gate and garden. In vain I protested.
"Oh, you little goosie," said Jennie,
laughing; "there'll be fun enough to
last us a lifetime. John wanted to
come awfully, but I know he'd make
an awful noise and spoil everything, so
I wouldn't let him."
The wily schemer took the precau
tion to lock the closet door from the
outside, so there was no fear of detec
tions On a high bench, as still as two
mice, we waited results.
Presently Cousin Mark, as if arous
ing from a protracted revery, asked:
"Would y3'u like to have me read?"
"Oh. I am not particular," replied
Miss Kent.
"Here is an excellent article on elec
tive affinities. How would you like
that?"
Jennie's elbow in my side almost
took away my bleath.
â¢"Who is it h, ' he inquired.
Jennie exclaimed--clear in my ear:
"That's to gain time! see if it isn't.
Now for something interesting.'"
"It's by a prominent French writer,
I belfeve," answered Cousin Mark.
"I don't think I care for a transla
tion to-night," said Miss Kent.
"Nor I; nor reading of any kind," he
continued. "This is my last evening
in New York, Miss Kent."
"I hope you've enjoyed your visit,"
she returned.
Jennie - into my very ,head this
time-"She is as shy as a three-year-old
colt."
"I didn't think I should feel so bad
about leaving." Cousin Mark went on.
"IHe is the wreck, you remember,"
wjiispered Jennie.
A lonIg pause.
"I think I hear the baby," exclaimed
Miss Kent.
"Oh, no," said Cousin Mark. "You
are fond of babies, are you not, Miss
Kent?"
No answer from Miss Kent.
"I have been a very lonely man,
Miss Kent." Cousin Mark resumed,
S"but never realized how lonely the
rest of my life must be until 1 came to
this house."
'~Oh, how lonely!" echoed Jennie.
"Now I must return to my business
and my boarding house-boarding
house for a ruan so fond of domestic
life as I am, Miss Kent."
Just then we distinctly heard a little
kind of purr, which sounded very like
a note of intense sympathy from Miss
Kent.
"'I have friends in San Francisco, of
course." said Cousin Mark, "but no
fireside like this-no one to care for
me if I'm ill, nobody to feel very badly
if I die."
"That'll fetch her," said Jennie.
"I wish that I lived in San Fran
cisco," said Miss Kent, in a little quiv.
ering voice. "You could call upon me
atany time if you needed anything."
Jennie in convulsions.
"If you will go to California with
me. Miss Kent, I'll wait another week."
"Why, Mr. Lansing, what do you
mean? What would folks say?" she
said.
"WVe don't care for folks," said
Mark. "If you will go we will have a
house as pleasant as money can make
it. You shall have birds, and flowers,
and horses, and all the scientific
monthlies that you want, deuced if
you shan't; and you shall never sew
another stitch for anybody but me.
Will you be my wife?"
. Just then Jennie and I stepped up
another peg and there was that little
old maid, who would not marry the
best man that ever lived. hugged close
to the man's breast who wouldn't mar
ry the best woman that ever lived, not
even to save her life. We came away
Sthen, but my opinion is that they re
mained in that position till we rang
the bell about half an hour later.
" "How did you know?" I asked of
Jennie.
"MIy dear," she answered, "my whole
reliance was upon human nature; and,
Slet me tell you, dear goosie, whatever
I else may fail, that never does."
"Why, Miss Kent, what makes your
face so very red?" inquired Jennie,
upon entering. "And, Consin Mark,
Show strangely you look. Your hair iE
,all mussed up."
S-"And I hope to have it mussed up
Soften," said Cousin 3Iark, boldly.
S"Miss Kent and I are to be married

SJennie laughed until her ce was
purple, and when I went upstairs Miss
Kent was pounding her back.--N. Y.

gree of negligence to prevail, and-farm
era worked when they felt like it, or
visited, or hunted, or fished, or frol
icked, so that when they went into the
field, as they. occasionally did, it was
merely for recreation. The soil was
prolific, the Rrices were good, and
wants were few, so that at the end of
every merrily bpept year the farmer 1
found himself richer by the natural
increment of his estate. Few
considered great wealth worth
the labor and worry to obtain
it. Their motto was "dum viva
mus vivamns:" and their aim to get
through life with as little physical and
mental friction as possible. They had
hot then learned to worship the golden
image stampnl upon the coins of the
realm, but thankfully received the
blessings of Providence. day by day, and
lived as near as. possible up to their
privileges. )lut times have changed;
there is no longer any place for the
sluggard, except on the outskirtsof the
procession. Population has increased;
civilization has invented innumerable
wants and the oportunities for gratifi
cation, though they have not de
creased, have wonderfully increased in
difficulty of attainment. Whereas a
man could farm with his hands
while occupying his Head and
heart with the 41menities and
pleasures of lime, now he
must struggle for existence with every
attribute with which he is endowed.
"Behold, old things have passed away
and all things have become new," and
man must adapt himself -to the new
order, or-get out of the way of the lo
comotive of progress when the bell
rings. Life, under the conditions of
the past, may be likened to a -well
stored sailing vessel on a placid sea,
tacking with every change of the wind,
only requiring that the helm and
halyards be properly handled, and the
port and harbor was reached at
lust, with certainty. . safety and
little cost. Now it is like the stately
steamer that must have all the
appliances of art and science; the boil
ers must hiss and strain at every joint;
the ponderous engines groan with every
stroke of the piston: the man at the
helm and the man at the binnacle must
be vigilant and sleepless; all previous
records must be broken or the ship must
sink. The first may be the more pleasant
voyage, but we are passengers at sea
on the latter craft, and can not go
ashore if we would. "Life is real, life
is earnest," and as it now exists. we
must exert ourselves. Old methods are
good no longer; the battle of life
calls for the improved weapons
of warfare. It may be a dear
price to pay "for worldly suc
cess, but it can not be purchased cheap
er. The great armies of idlers are
those who refuse to pay the price.
Agriculture is especially blessed at this
time, if we take things as we find them.
Success was never so perfectly assured,
nor its rewards so great as now, if we
only accept the conditions which re
quire that every faculty be engaged;
that we strive with diligence according
to the lights before us. There were
never more prosperous farmers than at
present, there was never a brighter
prospect than is now before them, no
matter what croakers say. - Texas

JOHNSON GRASS.
Method for Killing It out Pursued on the
Texas College Faran.
On the College farm a tract of about
ten acres was sown to .ohnson grass
seven or eight years ago for the pur
pose of obtaining a permanent mead
ow, and, notwithstanding manure was
applied, it did not make a good yield.
The soil is a light, sandy loam, vary
ing in depth from five to ten inches,
with a stiff impervious clay sub-soil,
into which the roots do not penetrate,
which accounts for the poor growth.
As usual the grass (lid not fail to scat
ter its seeds over the entire farm, soon
becoming a serious nuisance. It was
decided to get rid of the grass
if possible by close cultivation. This
meadow was broken broadcast in the
early fall with a turning plow and
immediately harrowed thoroughly with
a springtoothed harrow: was at this
time dry and warm. Nothing more was
done until about the ist of February,
when it was again broken broadcast
with turning plow and harr'owed with
springtoothed harrow, thoroughly pul
verizing the soil so as to admit of ea.y
surface cultivation with swveep. It was
prepared for late planting of cotton;
about the Ist of iay by working
broadcast and bedding with solid
sweep once to the row, at which time
the soil was in excellent tilth. Cotton
was planted immediately: came up in a
few days and grew of! nicely. It was
given frequent shallow cultivation
with buzzard wing sweeps, the cultiva
tion was continued until about 15th of
August.
The following fall when picking the
cotton, only a few sprigs of the gr:tss
could be found. and these for the most
part, alpeared on the "M'sandy mounds"
where the clay sub-soil does not come
near the surface. The following spring
-thlis land was put to corn, but was not
so carefully cultivated: it was followed
by cotton this year, closely cultivated
with sweep. This spring only a few
bunches of Johnson grass can be seen.

SHEEP-RAISING.
The Dark Side of It Told by a Tennesgee
Farmer.
Being a subscriber and reader of your
valuable paper for many years past, 1
have been favorably impressed with
your fairness in giving both sides a
hearing on those great subjects which
interest the agricultural world to-day.
For several years past you have been
publishing from time to time articles
greatly misleading in character from
the pen of that veneaable member of
the royal college of Rurgeons of Edin
burgh-Dr. Galen Wilson.
I do not for one moment suspect that
it would be any benefitto you as an ed
itor to publish articles which would
lead men of means in the north to sell
out, come south' invest in lands and
stock, make a failure from caises be
yond their power to control, become
poor as a large majority of the south
ern people are to-day, and return north
to build up again or ponder over the
mistakes they have made. 4
Dr. Galen Wilson'n articles have beean
Sflaming and misleading on the subject
of sheep industry in the south. liHe

Open ii this braneh of itdiutry, but
ftotunately I have Lot e*itered lito it,
beeause this state oMers io legal, pro
tlctiol to anythina except hogs, dogs
-hid cattle. These three aiitels stand
pie-bmiieilt.
All the legal protection ofered to a
sheep in this state is is to outfi'n a dog,
or put for the woods and climb a tree
that a dog can not ascend, And the
same legal protection is offered to the
enterprising flnmer. If he has a field
of corn, that must put for the woods
too, to escape the hogs aid cattle, or
become a victim to their greed. The
poor class are permitted by law, to
turn their hogs and cattle into "the
roads and there is no redress for the
crops they destroy This class can sit
in their doors and. laugh to see their
stock eating up and destroying what
the industrious farmers are trying to
tlase. For all the wrongs the law of
fets qnly the following reinedyr To
effectually prev is, the eiteiptkit
ing farmer is cobeled to live in a
"hog pen," that is to say, to keep a
fence five feet high and pig tight, en
tirely around his property, and as it is
not probable that a fence pig tight.
five feet high will stand the winds
of this mountain country but a
very short time, a large number
of farmers have fallen victims
to the follies of the day, by sending
out a drove of hogs and cattle to eat
up the labor of other,, and thus in
stead of becoming more just and civil
ized, they are becoming less cultured
and refined, and more devoted to tear
ing down and destroying the property
of others, than to the building up of
beautiful and inviting homes for them
selves.
This law drives out the very class
that all the northern states, from
Maine to the Rocky mountains, wel
come and want-the men of enter
prise and industry who have made the
north the home of genius, of beauty
and of wealth.-J. S. Davis, in Home
and Farm.
SWEET POTATOES.
A New Enema to the Taber. Discovered
in Texas.
I send you by to-day's mail some
pieces of sweet potatoes, infested with
what seems to me a new pest. I have
been told by some of my neighbors that
it sometimes completely destroys the
potatoe crop. The specimens sent were
found in potatoes purchased for seed.
You will find by cutting the potatoe, a
little white worm, and also some of the
matured insects. Is it likely to become
troublesome?
It seems to have made its appearance
on Bolivar peninsula, in Galveston
county, six or eight years ago. Its
ravages are much worse in dry years.
Sometimes at digging the potatoes,
they are so badly infested as
to unfit them for market.
If infested potatoes are stored
away in the fal, the worm or weevil
continues to work through the winter,
completely-honey-combing the potato.
Sometimes one field may be infested
and the one adjoining it exempt.--S. M. I
K., Alvin, Tex. I
After considerable correspondence and
investigation, I find that this insect is
spreading in Texas. It was originally
a subtropical insect, inhabiting the
northern part of South America and
West Indies. It appeared in 1878 in por
tions of Florida, and has done consider
able damage in parts of Louisiana dur
ing the past two or three years, so I am
informed by Prof. Howard, of Wash
ington.
This insect (Cylas formicarius) re
sembles somewhat the common weevil
in shape, but it is about three times as
large, and has a peculiar light-red pro
thorax. The larvae bore into the potato
and perhaps, the adults also. No rem
edy seems yet to have been discovered,
except burning the infested potatoes.
Growers, especially along the coast
region of the state, can not be too care
ful to destroy this pest on its first ap
proach. New varieties of potatoes
which are now being sent over the
state, should be examined with care.
I believe this insect can be checked
now before it spreads further over the
state, if growers will only take it in
hand and destroy the first few which
may appear.-Cor. Farm and Ranch.
HERE AND THERE.
-If any farmer is not able to pay his
debts, let him call upon his hogs for
help, and he will not call in vain if he
treats them as he should.
-The difference between two pro
cceses of harvesting a corn crop is the
difference between forty bushels of
corn, cobs and shucks and eighteen
tons of silage.
-The melancholy fatt that stock
men have been selling off their best
breeders is fully offset by the fact that
other breeders have purchased the
same.
-On many farms one of the princi
pal causes of failure to make good
butter is the lack of uniformity in the
conditions under which the wvor is
done.
-If you think the cows don't pay
while on grass try feeding thems some

with them before and after feeding the
meal.
--Who is it among farmers that is in
debt to the Israelite for food and rai
ment? He that spendeth his time and
substance in the cotton field and neg
lecteth the corn and hog.
-On most farms the poultry don't
receive the care and attention that the
other animals do, and thus the average
product of eggs and fowls are kept
down by car'elessness.
-Fruit-growers have found that
where a new orchard is planted on the
