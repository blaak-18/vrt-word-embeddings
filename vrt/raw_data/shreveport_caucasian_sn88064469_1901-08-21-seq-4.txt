A DESPERATE DEED
A Wile and Mother Abandoned,
Deatitute. In Despair
Poisons Herself and Her Two
Sons
Mrs Charles Carroll is dead; so Is hel
son, Gesorge Carroll, aged elix years.
W hat is life!
Some men cling to it, even when in ex.
tremities; others would welcome Death,
as a boon-a release from trials and tnbu
lations, from misery, from heart aches,
from despair.
The death of Mrs Carroll end her son Ie
pathetic and the recital by her son, Clyde
Edwards, aged eight years, reveals a son
ditlon lin her marred life whihob is tilled
with gloom and disappolmtment. It is
suench an experience as would break a good
woman's heart, and lead her to welcome
Death, as the harbinger of peace and rest.
Wesay of ile. abandoaed by her bus,
hband, broken hearted and in despair, she
became deeperate and determined on
rem ivng from earth her two eons, the
offspring of her husband, and herself,
through the medium of poison-morphine
of the three Clyde Edwards survive.
W ith no hope of improvement, with a
future as dismal as a rayless night; with
no voice to enounrage, no head to uplift
her ftrom the despondency by whibch she
had been overwhelmed, Mrs Carroll gave
her two sons, In soda pop, on Monday
morning, the poison, morphine, of whichb
her youngest child, George, drank the
fallest, walle the eldest, Clyde, refused to
drink his portion because it was bitter,
Mrs Carroll having gulped what was left
of the fatal dose, started, no deubt, to thi
will, where her husband, a bricklayer,
was at work, Ltot on the way her youngest
s a, overeome by the poisaon, ell, and the
mother and her son, Clyde, too, were soon
helpless. It was about 10 'elok a m,
when these unfortunates were seen to
their agonizIalng condition, but for som i
unexplained reaeso, they were not re
moved to the BHespital until 1 a, although
the polloe headquarter. (station) has been
advised and urged to givre them attention.
The eldest son, Llyde, survived. His
mother and brother suooumod to the fatal
dose.
8uob in brief l1 the story, sad an(
touchlng-a- story which would move the
heart, even of a man of stone.
Who : to blam). Who should be be:c
responsible for the death of this womu i
and her soa ?
The Carrolls are strasgeie in 8brevi
port, being know. only to a low. Carroll
tr, carue to this oity from Jcplln, Kanusa
with his two sons. toeerge and Clyde,
Mrs Carroll followed and returned t<
Joplin with her sons. About two weeki
Kag Mrs Carroll returned with thtm U
Shreveport.
We do not know what were the diffr
ences between this man and wife, but bel
sat would nldicate that some grat prove
cation led ber, In desperatioa and depair,
to poison ha sons and herself.
Where is the womsu, even of the lowes
cstate, who would, except when berett ol
reuaon or prompted by the toe moot extra
orlinary condition or eircaumtanoe, lead
her to a ded so rash and unnatural ?
Porhaps the Cauoaslen Is rather sentl
mental and Is iolineod to view such misfor
taues with pritoand )sypathy, but we
would rather be ympathetlo and seMLI
mental than cold and formal. We would
rather hare an inmeasurable store
of sympathy, of oommiseration for
suoh on unfortunate wcmua than to olass
her rs a murdereren-who "murderod her
child and thea hersell," as one whuse
"death rolelves the offiers of the law of
the Iaoeselty of any extended lanvetiga
