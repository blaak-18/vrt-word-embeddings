On the Currency Question
The following comments are sug
gested by t'he questions recently pro
pounded to you by Mr. Montgomery,
of Hattiesburg, Miss., concerning the
effect on prices of an augmented vol
ume of money, to which you replied
in your editorial columns.
The purchasing power of money
does not* fluctuate, A change of
price, under normal conditions, indi
cates a change of value in the com
modity, and so the money will pur
chase the same value it did before
the change in price though t'he quan
tity of the thing purchased may be
more or less than it was before the
change in price.
Were it possible for the value of
legal-tender money to change, the
change in price would indicate noth
ing, and the business world would be
at sea in regard to values.
A distinction should be made be
tween a failing currency and an in
crease in the volume of money. When
a currency is failing, a change in
prices does not indicate a change of
value in the commodity; prices on all
things will be advanced, not by reason
of an increased demand, but in order
to avoid loss from taking a currency
that is worth less than it was when
the former price was fixed on the
article purchased.
When prices advance through the
stimulating effect of a larger volume
of real money, it is caused by’ the in
creased demand for useful things. In
the first instance it takes -more cur
rency to purchase an article because
the value of the currency is failing;
in the second instance it takes more
money to purchase the article because
the value of the article has been in
creased by demand.
It must be understood that the first
effect of increasing- an insufficient
money volume is to stimulate demand;
but the secondary effect is to stimul
late production, and so check the ad
vance in price.
Had we an adequate volume of
, money a change in its volume would
have no effect on demand, or produc-

recognized as the spokesman for this
element. He was of the aristocratic
class. His mother was an Elliot and
had taught him from babyhood that
which was taught to all the children
of the aristocracy. The Elliots had
been office holders and prominently
identified with the politics of state
since the days of the Revolution. No
people felt more keenly the defeat of
the dominant party than did Narcisso
Gonzales. His Spanish connection
and Spanish blood gave a venom to
his hatred that can not be excelled
or even equaled by few.
He wrote scathing article after ar
ticle. People who did hot know won
dered and asked from whence such
unlimited bitterness and gall. He
had been taught it from his infancy.
It was the result of generations of
training. Equally as bitter and un
compromising were the leaders on the
other sidtt. The Tillmans were as in
vective and vindictive, alike due to
training- which had gone on for a hun
dred years.
The representatives of social train-
3effersonlan
tion, if the change in quantity did
not reduce the volume below the
amount required to answer all the
money needs.
Had we a volume of money suffi
cient to engage our full powers of
production, further production would
be impossible, and so an increase could
not affect production; and with our
full powers of consumption engaged,
we could not increase consumption, so
an increase of the money volume could
not affect demand, or derange prices.
The assumption that absolute money
cheapens is not well founded. From
’62 to ’65 we increased our currency
volume twenty fold, and yet prices did
not go “kiting.” Prices barely doub
led during the war, and all the ad
vance in prices can be accounted for
by reason of the war.
Expansion of credit increases our
circulating medium and the same ef
fect should follow as would follow an
increase in the money volume; and
yet, credits are expanded a hundred
fold with no abnormal effect on prices.
Millions of clearing- house certifi
cates were issued in the panic of ’93,
and yet prices did not preceptibly ad
vance; and again in 1907 we had a
tremendous contraction of credits fol
lowed by an enormous issue of clear
ing house certificates, but no material
change in prices.
Then ■again, this enormous issue of
wood-pulp currency of the associated
banks was taken in and cancelled in
a few months, and yet prices have
stiffened rather than declined —all of
whic|i goes to prove that we could
have a sufficiency of money without
danger, and that prices would take
care of themselves.
It is not the “money power” that
prevents our having the required vol
ume of money, it is a false economic
belief, to wit: That to increase the
money volume is to impair the value
of the money unit; a doctrine that
cannot lie sustained by logical reason
ing. Respetfnlly,

ing and political vindictiveness met
face to face on that fatal day and a
startling tragedy was the result. It
could not have been otherwise. The
shot that slew Gonzales had been
moulding- for a century, and after
more than a hundred years was sped
on ils course of revenge. The two
sections are responsible, and when in
at ter years the blame is properly and
rightly placed it will go back to the
very first days of the settlement of
the colony.
