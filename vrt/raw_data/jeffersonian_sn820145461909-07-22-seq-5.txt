Let the Air In
The State Sanitarium for the treat
ment of tuberculosis is to be located
near Mt. Airy, Georgia. $13,000 has
been appropriated for the establish
ment of this sanitarium and $12,000
more will be made available later.
Nov/ that we are getting away from
the theories that heredity was the
chief cause of consumption and that
there were but certain localities
whose climate might effect a cure of
the consumptive, it should be the
shame of the South if a native case
be found her after a decade or so.
A constant supply of fresh air and
plenty of food and exercise will eradi
cate the scourge in time. Meanwhile,
it should be preached to the people
to get as much sunlight and air as
possible in the homes; and instead of
cutting but one or two windows per
room, why not make every roof in a
dwelling a literal “sun parlor,” abol
ishing dark, damp rooms in winter
and giving a free sweep of air all the
time? Entering the most airy room
at present from out-doors, or even
from the porch, and it is some time
before one becomes accustomed to
the first stifled feeling. This could
easily be changed by building houses
in better accord with the need of
oxygen. Substitute doors and win
dows for solid walls and the next gen
eration would be stronger in every
respect. Not only actual disease, but
much of the neurasthenia and general
malaise would be overcome by giving
humanity a fair chance to breathe.
Where one house is properly venti
lated, especially at night, a hundred
are almost hermetically sealed. It
is both amusing and pathetic to listen
to the average closely settled neigh
borhood preparing to “retire.” Slam,
go the shutters, bang the windows,
and click-click the catches to hold
them down. Then the gates are
latched, the doors locked, barred and
bolted and perhaps even the tran
soms tight shut. Most of this is due
to mere habit. In many a home the
last tender good-night consists of an
anxious: “Did you lock the back
door?” or “are you sure the pantry
window’s down?” If these things
are not done, certain members of the
family wouldn’t get a wink of sleep
for fear of being carried off bodily
before morning. It is a most deplor
able form of slavery—this utter de
pendence upon positive assurance
that every crack and crevice is closed
as tnough one were beleaguered by
enemies of diabolical cunning. Not
only does it lower the standard of
vigor the race might otherwise at
tain, but it perpetuates the old terror
of the dark and instills fear into the
minds of little children.
Timidity, like love, grows by what
it feeds upon and it seems to me most
regrettable that girls are literally
taught to be cowards. Prudence was
certainly seldom more required than
today, when the press is full of hor
rors. But this is altogether a dif
ferent thing from that shrinking
from being alone, even in perfect
safety, and that hideous uneasiness
many women feel even with abundant

masculine protection if the house is
not fairly barricaded against imag
inary dangers.
Boys are shamed out of showing
fear until it is not often we find a
man who is an actual physical cow
ard, and yet they are likewise taught
that they must be able to defend
thems l' T es in case of real danger. It
is no more natural for a girl to be
cowardly than for a boy, and in mul
titudes of examples women have risen
to the occasion of genuine perils with
true heroism.
Once a woman explained to me

In the Care of Sleep
When fall the sable shades of gloomy night,
Like a funeral pall,
And from the denser forest close at hand
Night birds begin to call;
While from the azure vault high overhead
Bright stars begin to peep,
Like signal lights on lesser wafer craft
Upon the misty deep;
I love to sit and contemplate the scene,
To hear the beetles hum,
And listen to the booming of the surf,
Much like a martial drum;
While all around me Nature seems to rest,
As weary from her toil,
And on the stormy waters of the day
Sleep pours her soothing oil.
Then rest and ease come to my weary limbs
And to my heart sweet peace,
The while my brain, long full of busy cares,
Knows then a short release;
And worldly things are drivsn from my mind,
Like clouds from summer skies,
While visions of that better future life
Come to my longing eyes.
The certain knowledge of a future state
Is spread before my view,
A nd' all the ways of a sustaining faith
To Hope are bent anew;
The while my soul, as caged bird set free,
Springs upward in its flight,
And leaves my body in the care of Sleep,
All through the silent night.

personally seeing that every key was
turned in every lock, was, not that
she was afraid of any thing, but that
she was afraid she might become
afraid, —which was a thoroughly
feminine way of expressing the fear
of nameless fear itself, which is the
worse of all horrors, and cannot be
experienced by anyone in normal
state of nerves. That is the fear in
delirium, or may be approximated by
persons who deliberately “work
themselves up” as children some
times do by reciting ghost stories
until they are a-quiver with dread of
some awful hobgoblin springing
upon them out of the dark.
During the days of the Western
block-house and fort, when hideous
savages swooped down upon an iso-

lated handful of “palefaces”; in the
Indian mutiny, when the fate of the
English would have been worse than
death; during the Boxer rebellion
when defeat would have meant tor
ture and outrage, the women were
self-controlled, helpful and brave;
yet doubtless in civilization, in a
community of friends, surrounded by
their families, these women were
just as “nervous” over the fasten
ings, and just as distrustful of the
dark as any of us. Why not throw
off some of this conventional and ac
quired timidity in the interests of
calmer nerves and stronger bodies?
Aside from screens against flies
and mosquitoes, leave the house
thoroughly open, except where the
sleeping apartments are all above the
ground floor. The “night air”, espe
cially in cities and towns, is much
purer than the smoke-filled “day air”,
and if an evil-doer is determined to
break in, he will manage it despite
most precautions, so why smother in
an effort to defeat the hypothetical
burglar?
SEASONABLE CLAM COOKERY.
Clam Chowder.
Chop a quart of soft clams, peel
and slice six potatoes thin, tie up in
a cheesecloth bag six whole allspice
and six cloves. Put a quarter of a

hours. After cooking 3 % hours, add
the clams and four pilot biscuits that
have been soaked in milk. Serve very
hot in a tureen.
Creamed Clams.
Chop fine two dozen clams. Make

Fill with the clam mixture, putting
a layer of sliced boiled potatoes on
top with a sprinkling of grated
cheese, cover with a thin crust and
bake. —Boston Herald.
AN ANTIDOTE FOR SUICIDE.
They tell of an Atchison girl who
thought her heart was broken. She
was so convinced of it that she be
gan reading up on deadly poisons,
and cried softly to herself over the
thoughts of an early death. At this
juncture a friend sent her a box of
chocolates. She ate one; life looked
a little brighter. She ate another;
why not put off that death till next
week? She ate a third and forgot
she ever had a trouble. All of which
is proof of the claim of an Atchison
physician that when people are mor
bid and unhappy the most effective
cure is something to eat. No one, he
says, can long for death while en
gaged in chewing something palata
ble. The man who talks suicide
should be given a beefsteak instead
of advice. —Atchison Globe.
