chance, hook them, and there was an

Ing buttoned or fastened up the back
the woman who is her own maid expe
riences many an unhappy quarter of
an hour. Even if the bodice is secured
in front there are usually lacings or
fastenings at the side, and the collar
band is a thing by itself, for it closes
not In front with the rest of the gown,
but at the back with almost impossible

for killing time could well be found
than the buttoning, hooking and pin
Ding that go with a trimly turned out

first sketch, a blue and white foulard d

satin ribbon and boa of silk muslin
edged with chantilly lace. o0
The popularity of foulard is unbound- P'
ed perhaps because it adds decided
utility and wearableness to its beauty.
This costume illustrates, too, the dee
orative value of openwork herringbon
Ing as applied to skirts. To the plain I
skirts of moderate length this tasteful a'
stitchery imparts a particular cachet Ii
Tnere is no doubt, then, as to the crea
tion being of the Immediate moment, a'
although those who are economically d'
Inclined to the renovating of last year's Cl
possessions may make it a valuable a'
ally. A skirt, for Instance, with a nar
row front width and wide back looks
exceedingly well with the herringbon
ing carried up either front seam and ti
also center back, but it is on the skirt
of many seams that this ornamenta
tion Is at its best.
Fine book muslin with the popular
ring spot. plaited to princess form and

poses the summery black and white It

vest is of chiffon. A bow of black vel- I
vet gives an effective finish to the cor-

latest fashion for an afternoon gown.

The cap that tops off a suit so daz

all the colors reflected from the shoul

when buying a bathing suit a bold set

make it brittle; hence they should only
be used where there is a preponderance
of oil. While vaseline often prevents
hair from falling out, it also makes it
darker; so the caution to rub it on the
scalp and avoid getting it on the hair
is especially important to fair haired
women.
There are many methods of perfum
ing the hair, which is much a fad now
adays. The scent can be put in the
rinse water or on the hair just before
it is dry or a perfumed cap can be
worn at night. It is best, however, not
to confine the hair at night. Braid it
losely or have it flowing if It does not
snarl easily.
Do not use hot irons on the hair if
you wish to keep It silky and long.
Tight crimping pins are also injurious.
If it must be curled, do it up loosely in
kids or soft paper. A soft curl is much
prettier than crimps.
Do not tie the hair up tight on the
head. It not only loosens the roots and
is a prolific source of baldness, but it
makes impossible that soft, loose, pret
ty effect which is essential in modern,
fashionable hairdressing.
Well kept hair in a healthy condition
should be soft and pliable, with a rich
silky luster that is the most exquisite
frame for any face, old or young.
A Lovely Black Toilet.
A lovely toilet of black crepe de
chine which has just emanated from a
well known Parisian shop Is beauti
fully embroidered In black silk cord,
with little Insertions of olack lace. The
skirt is cut tight to the knees, whence
comes a shaped flounce of the embroid
ery, with a quantity of froufrouing
frills of chiffon. The simple banded
bodice has a deep falling collar of the
same embroidery, with an inner vest
of white tulle.
The Napkin Problem.
Do not crumple up your table napkin.
If you are only a guest for the day, do
not fold it up, but if you are staying
on and in a quiet household fold it up,
remarks an exchange. If you are stay
ing in a big house where everything Is
done en grand prince, do not fold it up.
Just place it on the table when you
leave, as in rich establishments there
are clean table napkins every day.
Fashion's Eehoes.
Foulards will be greatly worn this
season, but always of the satin faced
kind, except for seaside or country
wear. They are profusely trimmed
with lace and velvet ribbons.
Pure white costumes in every imagi
nable material - white pique, white
duck, white linen, sheer white wash
fabrics, white cloth, white serge, white
camel's hair and white taffeta-are the
fashion of the summer.
Artificial flowers are flourishing on
gowns this season.
Sashes of every description promise
to be a prominent feature of afternoon
and evening costumes. With lawn and
organdle toilets the sashes are of the
material, insertion striped and lace
trimmed. ... ,-._

There are some misguided girls whot
still wear their hair In the pompadourl

but they will soon mend their ways.
I fancy this style is quite English,j
anil with a little change It would be-4

French faces would not look well at all
with the hair dressed so. Anyway, the
regent dip is an English fad.
Seen under the irregularly shaped
hats of the present day this waved andl
untlulating way is pretty, and yet the
wind makes sad havoc with the loosely
fastened locks.
Suppose the lady has bright gold
hair and suppose she wore a gown o
the rich new royal blue, with a hat to
match, with no end of fine chiffon an
tulle and delicate flowers, and a whole
lot of filmy chiffon or lace around the
beck, wouldn't she look too sweet tollve
And we will continue to suppose thad

dye were run. The whole costu
would be something worth standing
the rain to see.
The ntmber of flounced dresses on
sees now is great. A very pretty
fancy and one which seems to have
"caught on," as the boys say, is the
way of making lawns with many
flounces, each having a row of white
valenciennes edging. Even when t
lawn or other thin material is used the
edging is white. The waist is also gar
nished with the narrow lace. With a
this flummery a sash of ribbon belongs,,
either the heavy quality fringed out ori
the gauzy kind, which seems better)
adapted to the thin goods. Black veil
ing, grenadine and lawns, both cotton
and linen, may be trimmed with white
or black lace. The black is not sol
showy, but is more elegant.
A ver. rich effect is obtained In a
new importation, and that is by having
a dress of fine meshed lace and over
this another, or at least a deep flounce
of very coarse lace. This does not
mean cheap lace, but just the rich ands
heavy variety. String colored point des
venise is a most effective kind for thisl
use, and the more open designs are the!
best.
Perhaps It would be well to particu
larize, so that if any one wished to'
make such a gown she would know a!
little more. The lining Is in taffeta,
In ivory or cream white. Over this ius
the fine white brussels net, made so4
that the outside is a trifle looser than;
the princess lining. The thick lace ish
set on in form of a tunic or as two deepi
flounces. The fine lace has a scalloped4
edge, and two edges are brought to-i
gether in front and the scallops joined,
by tiny bows of ribbon, and each has a
small strass ouckle.
A cream colored veiling has 16 folds
all around the skirt, which is a deml
train. These folds reach but to the
hips, where they are joined by a corse
let of tqick string colored lace of thei
heaviest variety. This fits closely allj
around and fastens invisibly In the
back. The waist is made of folds, with|
a bolero of the lace. Bruges is a good4
lace tar this k1 tPe.1
