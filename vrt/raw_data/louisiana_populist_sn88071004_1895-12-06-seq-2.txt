country are engaged in agriculture,
but nine tenths of the ofices are
held by the other classes.-Ex.

We are "Dying out" one week
and are requested to "come back"
the next, by our esteemed Enter
prise. We presume that upon in
vestigation it did not find as many
dying out as its first article proph

Come Back-W-ith a Big C. F
While hugging its dear old de
lusion, the Democracy, to its bo
som, with a tearful voice our es- C
teemed neighbor, the Enterprise, u
implores the Populists to "Come a
Back," to return to the Democrat- C
ic fold, to receive a slice of turkey g
and a piece of the pie. v
"Come back"! For what? Come t
back to a party that is founded r
upon sentiment and grounded upon t
the bug-lear and fear of negro a
domination f
Come back to a party which has t
ieen sustained and upheld only by
the ability of the machine to vote 1
dead negroes, thereby placing in (
power a few professional office
seekers who care no more for the a
will of the majority than a rattle t
snake does for a toad
Come back to a party that is
fighting free silver ; a foe to all re- 4
form and the friend of the trusts
and the corporations with which 1
this country is infested ?
Come back to a party which re
cognizes as its governor, in this
and in several other States a man
upon whose heads rest the stigma of
fraud, and who hold their seats
through the corruptness of party
henchmen, and perjured returning i
officers ?
Come back to a party, the gov- 4
enor of which, in this State, is a
sworn foe to the Alliance and to
ballot reform, and who is seeking
a renomination for the office which 4
he has hold, but upon which :,. I).
McEnery has a claim which no one
can deny or disprove ?
Come back to a party whose
chief organs fight a white primary,
practically endorsing a mixed one
thereby; who sanction the unlaw
ful practice of counting every ne
gro as a Democrat, whose Presi
dential failure is the laughing stock
of creation; whose majority Con
gress (id nothing but draw pay ?
Come back!! To cap the cli
max we are invited to eat turkey
when the Democracy is eating
crow. Of course, we will come
back when we can bring the milen
ium with us. Then, only then,
will we come back.
MODERN POLITICS.
What Coastitutes a Demerat.
Did you ever see the like. Two
men highly honored by the Demo
cracy, pulling hair, fighting each
other, one howling for silver, one
for gold, both swearing they are
- Democrats. The one being back
ed by a lot of my-daddy-was a
Democrat, variety, the other be
ing backed by the administration
office holders who are drawing
booze and boodle from the State
and all are Democrats.
I Do you call yourself a Demo
cr- art ! Honestly, what do you
a think of such a farcical proceed
Sing as this: What is a Democrat
Sanybow I How does your neigh
g bor look when he tells you be is a
SDemocrat: If be was a man,
h don't you think he would quit this
fmangling, lying, disgreeful gang
of ofice hunters and salary grab
berst You need wot meander a
4 thousand miles from here to find
ptwo such men. Oh, you want us
to be specific, well, have you ever
seen a bear trapt No, well no
doubt you would want to see us
put our foot in one. We must de
cline wtb thanks.

People's Party State Meeting co
at Alexandria. ar
Ut
The People's party State Central P
Committee of Louisiana, at it's of
meeting in Shreveport in August, ht
appointed a Campaign-Executive th
Committee of 1 from each con- ti,
gressional district, and 1 at large
with the chairman and secretary of it
the central committee, ex-officio k
members, for the purpose of facili
tating the work of the party and I
saving the time and expense of a P
full meeting of the Central com- t
mittee.
This Campaign-Executive com- i
mittee met pursuant to call of r
SChairman Booth, at Alexandria, d
on Tuesday, the 26th ult., with tl
all the members and several invi
ted leaders of the party present, as
follows: A. B. Booth, Chairman; tl
R. 1). Wilde, Orleans; I. J. Mills.
Calcasieu ; J. T. Howell, East
i Baton Rouge; E. C. Dillon, Sa
c bine ; J. W. McFarland, Claiborne;
A. Benoit, Ouachita, and H. L.
Brian, Secretary Committee, with
3 N. V. Bush, of Rapides, Josiah
I Klienpeter of E. Baton Rouoe, t
E M. Vincent, of Calcasieu, B. W.
; Bailey and Dr. A. P. Collins, of
r Winn, R. P. Johnson, of Jackson, t
and J. A. Tetts, of Natchatoches. t
The meeting was promptly call
ed to erder by Chairman Booth, at
a 1:30 p. m., in Room 24 of the
> Exchange Hotel.
i The Chairman stated the objects
i of the meeting to be the consider
ation of a call for a State nomina- a
c tint convention, and the details of t
same. He also stated that Mr. u
e Andrew Hero, Jr., of the old-line a
Republicans, and Mr. C. McD. '
r Puckett, of the sugar planter Re- f
- publicans, were present, and N ould i
- make our party some propositions r
looking to the support of the Pop- a
t ulist State ticket by their respec- t
- tivo factions.
? These gentlemen were then given a
- the floor, and stated in substance a
r that if the Populists would put out a
r a representative ticket of honest, t
e competent men on their own plat- (
- form, but denouncing the suffrage c
, amendment, that their respective t
factions comprising the whole of l
the Republican party of this State
would support the same in the in- i
1. terest of fair elections, and univer- t
sal suffrage.
The committee assured the rep
h resentative Republicans that the
Populists would continue their op
e position to the suffrage amemlment i
_ and that their platform would de- c
nounce same and stand for free sif- 1
I ver and fair elections, and that the I
ticket nominated thereon would be- a
be liberal and broad guaged.
The Republicans then withdrew
and the committee proceeded toa
Sprepare and issue the address call-i
a ing the State nominating conven
- tion, which address appeas else
where in this issue.
On motion, the committee ad
a ]ourned sine die, after a full and
harmonious session.
A. B. BOOTH,
H. L. BRIAN, Chairman.
Secretary,
State Campaign.
is The State nominating convention
ar of the People's party of Louisiana,
to meets in Alexandria, January 8th,
is 1896, for the purpose of nomina
- ting a full State ticket on a Popu
lous platform, free from fusion or
combine.
As has been foreseen for some
time, we have been promised th
asupport of large factions of other
Sparties which have despaired of
the success of any effort in their
own ranks to defeat the political
corporation that is bound together
by fraud, corruption, and spoils
Sof ofe, and that is dominating
the politics of this State.
The oppression of the boodler
e and bribe-taker in office, and the
Sstenoh of corruption auld fraud in
election, as well as in the adminis
tration of government, is becom
ing unbearable, and so disgusting
to every sense of morality or hoan
eity in politis that the common
iraiaet of self preservation will
biml tgthber every opponent of
- lbr ttmUe system of the present
ir uilmiuatration.
Thersieore Populist should take
courage and piut on thi-'r tiliiting
armor, for it is but natural that
this young, vigorous, uncorrupted
party. _nade up for the umost part
of the honest intelligent. horny
handed sons of toil, should lea:di
this peaceable, yet forcible revolu
tion for good goverlnluent.
The People's party must prove
itself equal to the emergency, and
lead this great revolution to victo
ry, over the downfall of the s, co
phants who have betrayed, dishon
ored and disgusted the people t(
through the Democratic partY.
Let the Populists of every par
ish organize if they hace not al- p
ready done so, and send in their
delegations tp our convention. Let
their delegations be coInmposed of
good men and true--broad-guaged
and conservative. Each parish in
the State and ward in the city of
New Orleans is entitled to one del
egate and then one additional dele
gate for each 21I) votes, or majori
ty fraction cast for Populist candi
dates for Congress in 1+94.
Elsewhere we publish the nunm
Iber of delegates each parish is en
titled to under this basis, as far as
we have been able to get the fig
Fures, and we hope that full delega
tions from each parish will be at
the convention in Alexand ia.
t POPULIST'S ADDRESS h
TO THE VOTER OF LOUIS
IANA.
The honest voters of this State o
are agreed on the one clear point- tl
f that views upon public issues are ii
utterly without value, so long as
swindling goes on at the ballot box.
What difference does it make to a
free silver man what views he holds, h
I if his vote on the currency issue is a
s not counted I We must first have
- an honest election; then we can
- talk about opinions on leading pub
lic questions. The one great is
a sue in this campaign is a fair,
e square vote at the ballot box and
t an honest count. Until we get
, this we are simply and only polit- ti
- cal slaves working for the master c
e of election machinery. That mas- 1
e ter is now Murphy J. Foster. t,
f The white supremacy is the trick
e of the ralseals to keep in power. t
I- t is the last card they can play in 1
the game of enslaving the people. f
They have always refused the test o
. of white supremacy when tender
, ed by their opponents.
The people of Louisiana desire
it and demand that they be heard up- I
on the silver question. We must 1
- be able to make our convictions c
e through our votes. The free coin
age of both silver and gold at the
ratio of 16 to 1 is certainly to the
w welfare of the masses. We must
, and shall make the issue and win
I- it at the next election, even though
- the enemies band together to rob
_ :and defraud us. The irresistible
force of public opinion is with us.
I-. The industries of Louisiana have ,
d been sorely stricken by adverse
legislation. Those who cultivate
the soil and raise cotton, sugar and I
rice have been cut down in the
house of their professed friends.
The People's party, through its
votes in congress, both house and
senate, has shown its friendship
for the wrecked industries of our
' State, wrecked by the Democratic I
Sparty, in its subserviency to for
Sein powers. We stand commit
ted here to the upbuilding of our
agricultural interests. No man
who tills the soil should be made
to suffer by discriminating legis-l
lation.
SThe People's party of Louisiana
r extends its hand to our well-nigh
ldestroyed cotton, sugar and rice
r industries, and demands for them
asuch relief as the national repre
uentatives of our party have long
sought.
r But why discuss, until we can
e express our views through the bal
in lot i Shall we longer submit to a
s.- governor and his political associ
a- ate who break election laws, in
g stead of executing them, sad who
a- hope to continue to hold oflee by
a frand t Will we be worthy the title
ll of citizens if we submit to thisa

atllieve in honesty, instead of fraud,
toorganize so asto assert theiir
