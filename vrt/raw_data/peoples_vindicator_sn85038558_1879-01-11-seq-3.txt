THE COLD WAVE.
Beautiful Snow- Iii Earnest.
The c,ohl wave, of which we read in
song ant story, struck us on Saturday
last. 14evions to that day the wesather
had bIee, dismal, cold and sloppy foir
nearly three weeks, but the thermolne
ter snlk to 2') "in the shade" adl the
rain was instiasltly transf,nrmed into
"pigeon snow." Its was tow, cold to
"llake." The tfll was over five inches
and the "'time consumed" thirty six
hours. The earth was mantled in pur
ity-well we won't get poetic, but it was
in fact cold enough to freezr the horns
from a billy goat
Winter.
The weather is startling to us of the
South. The thermomete: standing at
IC for three nights reminds one of the
frozen north : while a white mantled
earth for a wteek, with snow five inches
deep on tile level and a frozen river
full of skaters, are, facts which prove we
are fully in the "cold zone." Mankind
feels exhilarated under the influence of
this bracing weather ; our atmosphere is
pnriflle ; malaria destroyed; the soil
strenghtened for the agriculturalist, but
our stock suffers. We will venture to
assert that not less than ten thousand
dollars has been lost by the killing of
stock from the last freeze. And then by
what little outlay might not all this been
saved. Economy is a science our people
know but little of; and these winters,
iow becoming frequent, the improved
stock being reared-which requires that
more attention should be paid them-go
to make evidence that our farmers
should-and must in order to be ruccess
fdl--give more attention to their preser
vation and care during winter as well as
summer. Cotton at 7 cents per pound
will pay-if-we raise our own bread
and meat and re mre do tat if we but half
try.
BUSINESS.
It Has Dropped of Shddenly-Cotten,
Cera and Other Crepe.
Since Christmas business is fiat, to use
a favorite expression. Our merchants
are doing little or nothing but the proe~
pert for a Spring trade they tell us is
good.
"Pan Rock," si to speak, has been
reached here. as well as elsewhere, and
the credit system as a system, has burst
We -tonture the mild remark that
that system has been the damnation of
this country. Economy, a necessity to
the wealth of a people, was an impossibi
lity where a door was wide open for ex
penditure, and an expenditure where the
merchant was compelled, in self-defence.
to insnre against positive less to charge
a heavy profit. It is safe to say thit our
farmers who had "stores to trade in,'
and prided themselves thereon. have paid
an interest on what the y bought in the
shape of profits to cover losses to the
merchant of .fty per cet per annum, at
least
We would most dmildly suggest that
those who read this and are farmers take
that "fifty per cent fact" to mind, and
think of it in their ealm moods. And the
merchant who is supposed by the igno
rant to bea resper ofa rich harvest is
the worst broke man of the two. The
system was false from the start and
when that fallicy was xploded, which
the hard times have done, all were to.

Friday night :d inst.. shut in dark
cold. gloomy. wiib dull, leaden clouds
o'erhead. By 9 p. m, it wa sleet ng
fast and furious. Previous to this the
long-drenohed earth had been froren solid
on the surface. When the little folks
kneltdown that night and softly whis
pered, "Now I lay me down to sleep," the
sleet was pattering agaiust the window
panes and with whistling echo falling
on roof and house top.
Saturday morning each tree, sbrnb,
twig and leaflet was hung with diamonds
coined from Winter's icy breath, while
the brown and frozen earth, house tops
and every thing else were covered with
his snowy mantle proclaiming that the
Hypoborian king for once at least, was
monarch of all he surveyed. Sleet and
snow alternated during the day and by
night-fall, the earth was one broad ex
panse of winter scenery.
Sunday morning dawned bitter cold,
and while fair lassies were wending their
way to places of worships, the laddies
aye ! and full grown men, out on Cane
river sliding, or as they said "skeetin" on
the snow and ice. Right royal fun it
was for all hbands too. There were num
erous falls, cuts, bruises, some rather se
rious, but fortunately no bones broken.
Sleigh bells That too in the sunny
Sonth ! And in this ancient cityl It is
true, however, and they rang out right
merrily on the wintry air of last Sunday
and Monday, as various rudely contrect
ed sleds and sleighs dashed along oar
thoroughfares. The "boys" and young
sweethearts had some pleasant rides.
"Roundy" tips his felt hat to 8-, of
Hutson's stable, for a sleigh ride. Thank
you, Louis.
Of all the diabolical contrivances to
make physical contortions, just recom
mend "Roundy" to a long strip of smooth
leie in this country, and a crowd of
"green', citizens. Sprains, sores and bruses
are the natural sequence and ea-sequence
The ice was abundant in this locality
early in the week. Skates were eagerly
enquired for by a few who knew their
nuse. On Monday a pair 'was found and
the stange spectacle was shown of par
ties gliding gracefully to and fro on
implements on the ice on Cane river,
much to the astonishment of the "na.
tives." Confound the luck, "Roundy"
could not obtain a pair in order to ex
hibit his "agility."
