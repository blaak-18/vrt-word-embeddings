Summary of Events
Bills have crowded upon the at
tention of Legislature and public in
Legislature.
Georgia
With the
passed legislation. Educational mat
ters have received much attention,
the most important of these being a
bill introduced by Mr. Edwards of
Walton County providing for the
compulsory education of children in
Georgia between the ages of six and
fourteen years. It is hard to see
just how this law can be made ef
fective in many instances. There is
no doubt that children should be edu
cated and every means to this end,
even legal compulsion, presents much
that is justifiable, but the fact will
remain that parents on isolated
farms are not going to send their
girls over lonely country roads to
school; and the further fact remains
that the cost of books and incidentals
is onerously high to many people. In
states which do not have to contend
with the negro problem and wherein
books are free and the means of edu
cation thoroughly open, public senti
ment is so strongly against illiteracy
that the few who care nothing for
education themselves are shamed
into educating their children, and it
is difficult to believe that legal com
pulsion would be required in Georgia
if the child labor laws were thor
oughly enforced and it were made
comparatively easy for the poor chil
dren to be sent to school.

Senator Ward has introduced a
bill providing . that patrons of a
school may dismiss a teacher who
becomes unsatisfactory to the major
ity because of cruel treatment, neg
lect of duty, etc.
Senator Griffith wants all pupils of
the public schools to be taught sing
ing. It is just such ideas as Senator
Griffith’s which are retarding the
public schools’ complete efficiency.
So much time is wasted on superflui
ties that children who need to get a
practical education in the shortest
time are literally robbed. The ma
jority of our boys and girls must
early assume responsibilities. They
get enough manual training at home
without playing at it during the time
that they should learn to read,
write and figure. It seems a grave
educational mistake to give the child,
who must work with his hands in
later life, music, basket weaving,
drawing, painting, etc., while his
mind is being starved. After years
may give him no time for reading,
and perhaps all he will ever get of
general information or knowledge of
literature is during the few years at
school. Industrial schools are all
right in their place, but the admix
ture of so-called manual training and
time wasting superfluities with im
portant studies, for which, at best,
there is too little time, is a wrong
against the child of poverty.

Senator McCurry desires greater
privacy in the matter of legal execu
tions. Until capital punishment can
be abolished, by all means let the
harrowing spectacle be concealed as
much as possible. The same Senator

is the author of a bill which has
passed, making it a penal offense to
utter any false and defamatory re
marks about women. Heretofore the
slanderer was guilty of a civil tort,
and a suit for damages was all that
the sufferer might institute, usually
with no hope whatever of recover
ing, as usually the scandalmonger is
so busy making mischief he or she
has no chance to accumulate any
property upon which a levy could be
made.

Joe Hill Hall’s anti-pass bill has
again been killed.
Representative Wright and Sena
tors Kemp and Lamb desire the Ini
tiative, Referendum and Recall.
Senator Harrall’s bill providing for
increased penalty for bigamy was
passed.
An important measure looking to
the exclusion of negroes from em
ployment as firemen and trainmen in
the State will be presented to the
present session. This bill grows out
of the unsatisfactory award made in
the case of the striking firemen on
the Georgia Road, that award tend
ing to decrease the number of ne
groes employed only in the event that
their wages have to be raised to the
level of the wages now paid white
men. Os course, a general lowering
of wage is just as likely to result or
the driving of white men out of the
service altogether to the great in
crease of danger to the traveling
public.

Bickering over near-beer is now in
progress; the prohis fearing and the
antis hoping that the agitation of
that question may result in putting
the whole matter again before the
Legislature.
On the question of near-beer the
prohibitionists themselves are di
vided. The cause of temperance as
suredly gains nothing by changing
the label of the beverage, nor by sub
stituting inferior grades of alcoholic
liquors for the ordinary brands, and
if Real Beer, Near-Beer or any other
kind of beer is to be consumed at all
it becomes of vital importance to
know what such beverages consist of.
Cheap alcohol under any name is just
as deadly.

gone on near Melilla for several days.
It does not seem that Spain is as dec
adent as has been alleged if her peo
ple have spunk enough to object to
the burden of carrying on a war, the
need for which is not apparent, and
the motive in grave doubt. The Mo
roccan question has been one of great
complexity and Spain can in no wise
afford, from any standpoint, to abuse
the police powers which it holds in
Morocco under the treaty of Algeci

Spain should have learned a valua

little the worse than did other pow
ers through that conference which
was a triumph for her hereditary foe,
Germany. M. Delcasse was then Pre
mier. While not personally to blame
for the humiliation of France, Clem
enceau, in the course of hot debate
in the Chamber of Deputies, sarcas
tically so alluded to the former Pre
mier, with the result that his admin
istration failed of endorsement, which
was equivalent to a request for his
resignation. Aristide Briand, with
a new cabinet, is now at the head of
French affairs. He is a Socialist and
while he has professed determination
to carry on the Clemenceau policies,
the effect of the new ministry upon
international affairs is a matter of
much speculation.

tion of a Catholic
priest, who succeeded in persuading
the men to return to their work
without their grievances being ad
justed. Most of the men concerned
in this strike are foreigners of the
more ignorant type, subservient to
the opinions of the church; and the
church can generally be found either
actively or passively on the side of
the oppressor. It is highly unfortu
nate for mankind that this great in
fluence should be exerted to enslave,
and not to free. The church of Rome
is not alone to blame, but the Prot
estant churches by their inertia on
vital social, economic, and industrial
questions are continually driving
both preacher and layman out of the
fold.
Minute differences on trivial points
of dogma are given precedence. Just
the other day Rev. Dr. Houghton of
New York’s famous “Little Church
Around the Corner’’ declined to mar
ry a young Quakeress to a man of the
Methodist faith because neither had
been baptized according to the Rev
erend Doctor’s ideas. No legal or oth
er bar against the union of the young
people existed. Such downright sil
liness is fatiguing.

Bolivia and Bolivian citizens have
been highly disappointed and indig

that Bolivia and Peru were the par

interested spectator or possible par
ticipant in the contest. Just why the
Argentine Republic should be at
white heat is not altogether clear.
The demonstration of the mob at La
Paz against the Argentine Legation
was hardly serious enough to bring
on hostilities, since it appeared to
consist of nothing more than noise
and disorder and as such easily to
be dealt with peaceably.
Bolivia is much weaker in every
way than any of the other nations in
volved in the disturbance. Argentina
and Peru may have conspired to rob
Bolivia of territory, in which event
they are probably strong enough to
force the issue, unless Brazil takes
a hand, in which event the Acre River
lands w’ould probably go to the victor.
Bolivia, at any rate, is certain to lose.

ble howl of injury has
gone up from the press and citizens
of that State. Why? Because, the
Tenth Cavalry is of the “kinky-haid
ed” kind and Vermont protests, vig
orously, against quartering any ne
gro troops upon her soil. It was all
right to impose darky soldiers, with
their insults and outrages, upon poor
little, helpless, isolated Brownsville,
Texas, but it is a different story when
the U. S. Government desires to send
them into the region where they can
be surrounded by the friends who,
theoretically, love them so dearly as
to want to force social equality upon
the rest of the country.

Such cases are object lessons of
inconsistency.
