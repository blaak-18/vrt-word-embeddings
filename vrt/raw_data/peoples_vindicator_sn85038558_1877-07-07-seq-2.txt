sunoption is strong that he did steal es.

the gentle lash of the VISNICAT'R. hose
Mien who are innocent of clime his
when charged with it are not only I'
anxious, but extremely restless until
they are exonerated in full; and they 1
are funthermore quick and solicitols
to furnish to the public e(very (loc-I-;
ment that ears uplon the case, par- froi
ticularly when pnllic paynasters, are inl

their books and vouchers, that the lie
public may know at onice and for all ant
the entire working of public bust- ire
ness. the
Myers has nevrer shown this an:ie- .
ty or solicitnde. O)n the contrary, he
Ias made every effolit to dodge trial
and beat off an examiniation. Ile has go
(quiºtiy rested ulnder a most heinous
charge, that of ptindering the most ti(
sacred' fund known to law, for f~ma del
years, and now that a just punish- e. l
mena is about to be ineeted out to him, to
he squirmsn under a justitiable expres- sin
eion of public opinion. dol
Myers has no right to expect Inerc.an
at the hands of these people-stern jor
justice yes, but lhe must make his inl to
aoeense as clear as the noonday. Not
will he be accotded the piviledg o dof
being considered innocent until hie dis
has been proveni nott guilty. As the pul
N. 0. Democrat eloquently remarks, inc
in relation to the nIottoriou4l I)ibleC
whici we reproduce, as it covers bet
Myers' case and standing to a dot: ha'
"''his general deiLial lliamounts to nothi- n
ing. There is ti! it a lan who has acted all
ili public life "tlduring." to use Jludge 'l
I)ibble's language, "tilnes ofahlost nni- i
versal corruption,," who would not enter an
a general denial of aniy charge of corrup
tion that might he lmade against him. 1
If we are to receive the assuratnces of s
the men who for eight yeairs have op ho
pressed anlld pltdeilid lloisianaii, we "'
should canonize WarmithVl Ii as a saint anid
hohl up Kellogg as a paragonll of the to
luftiest political virtue ; even Twitchell l
would be a lmartyr to patriotislm, and the ha
fugitive Wickliffe would returnil to the
bosomn of a repentant and admlnring peo an
pie. Juidge Dihble's general denial then til
cannot avail hhiu. lie must establish li
his innocence by evidence as clear as til
the noonday sun. Even his acquittal e1
by a jury for lack of testimony will not
clear him before the people (if Louisiana. t
In his letter Judge Dibble claims thait
he is entitled to be considered innocent l
until he has been proved to be guilty. t
We wish that Judge I)ibble's antecedents
anl associations had been such that we
and the people generally could pursue C
toward him this generous policy which fi
the wis4doln of lie law has adopted in
its dealings evenu with the worst class ,
maalefactors. lint that is hnpossible.
Hle has forfeited his right to this advan r
tage and placed himself before this peo
pie in such ,an attitude that the weighlt
of public opinion is so decidedly against t
him that he must stand convicted inr
coimmon estimation until he can produce
irrefutable evidence to show his inn- r
cence. When lie shall have done this
he may count uponii our sense of justice,
if notupon our generosity, to set him
right beftre the eountry.
But Judge D)ibble elaitns exemption
from attack ton the g'rollind that hlie ati
his party '"arie tlefeated." Our attackli
tpon him, he says, is ungenerous, he
cause lie is toietlld. This is a new ti;eorl
ofl politics antid haiw. We hadl not hearil
that the defeat of a political party exs
empted the acts uif its ofliicials fromn
criticismn or attack; or its leaders and
otlice-bohlers frohii proseutit fir often i
ses coltnlitted by theln against the law.
Were this theory adopted, the otieials ,
of every successfal party woull be ntdeln
undter an obligationi to beeotie the ac
cessories of the tdiciail crinitals who t
might have pIreceded tiheti, and ill thi
rapid transtuntaticn of parties all public
men woulti soon become involved in
general atd cotlinon guilt. This doc
trine may, however, be regartlded as the
legitimate offspring of the Radical party.
If, however, Judge Dibble means only
that we are under a sentiiental obliga
tion not to attack a defeated-a routed
-enemy, he ought tt hare poiitedt to
us some one instance at least, in which 1l
he and his party exhibited any considera-i
tion for, or generosity towalrd, the mllore
than tour hundred IthouIsand white citi
iens of Louisiana whonl they had notil
enry retted, but held as it were untder
their f et iwkh the bayonets of the Fed
eld.gove'tmenct. That was the pr,,pet
tinmo for Judge Dibble andl his associates
to practice that generosity of which,
now that the law has laid its hantd upo
hiln, ie so eloquently preaches. We
lold that no man belonging to Julge
libble's party has any right to expect
generous treattnent fronn this people;
and they may iest assured that we are i
astemlper todcsplay any toward them.
Let Judge 1ibble review the political his
tory of Louisiana dtring thie eight yeare
in which he was one ot the ablest ait
most influential men- noernedtl iu its
government; let hint fihtaro pl the
amount of taxes that lhas bIcu el dolleet
ed from our people, anti tihe debt that
ha been created; let himn estilnate the
Jepreciation anti ruin of property an
adeo; let him ponder over the r~sults
of the electnons of which he and hi
party by forgery aRtd pei'jury robbed us;
let him glance through the statutes of
that eight'yeas, a disgrace to civilization,
and wread' those acts outlawing eitizeus
for non-poyment of taxes, and the law
to subvert justit*and prolong the powet
of the wotst mee that ever cursed a
country; let him refer te thebought and
partisan iectisions ot a. S'upreme Court
which was the instrument of a' usurpa
tion and always the resistless enemy

was its sacred duty to protect. Let hi

the President, delfato, labored tunit

ernl people would becolme traitors
to their princilples aod ceonvietions,
simply bIceause justice h:ad been

f t
an abli and intensely Repubnllican
journal, has this to say in regard
to 1 [ayes' sad disappointinent:
Are we to conclude that the l'resi
dent is alr(eady in soiie particulars 1l0
disappointedl A conscionsness of the li
purity of his nmotives, and a natural
inclination to accept nassnrances ill

The same cannot he aflirnmed of those
whom he has gathered around him '1
and who share with himi the respon- toi

loubtedly. vague expectations of t"'
support from quarters Irevionsly wit
hostile, and now andl then we heard ral
of dieams of a Whig resurrect ion,
with a reconstrction of Southern part- 6i
ies as its immediate result. In a the
modlited form these anticipation may it
have entered the tiindl of the Presi
dent and conifirmed him in what at col
any rate looked like indifference to hol
the feelings and wishes of the Repulb I
licean majority. Having iisen above
the level of party in his eagerness to inc
ettle the quarrels which endallgered its
the peace of two Sounthern States, it tlu
was not unnatural for him to assunme
that they who were to profit by his
plan, and with friendly professio).
urged him forward to its eonsnmma
tion, would in turn emancipate them
selves from tle bondage of the Demo
cracy. From this source lihe may have
hoped to derive, not the elemenlits for or
forming a third party, but such in- ti
thlinees as would compensate for the i
;fiicnation of Southern Iepluhblicaon ",
and imnpart to the Republican Party a
in tlhe South morein vitality thainu it b
had possessed. If Mr. Hayes euite' - p
tainied hopes of this nature we can ls
readilv comprehend the feeling which ,i
lhas supervened. It is not the feeling ;P
incident to failure, for dIr. Ihayes
insists as contidently as ever that l h
whait lie has done will he vindicated th
ty its conseqcences. But the lassump ig
Lion on which lie proceedeld has part of
ially liroken down. HIe receives fine th
iiworils from the South, ihlt little In o t
inone of the tangible help which in ti
his postioig is mitost required. He is "
piromlised votes in Congress as against al
disaffected Radicals, but not a vote
is tendered hii as against the Demo
erecy in any contest of parties. To a
this extent, at least, lie experieuce
disappointment. Ci
We had no110 idea that Mr. hayes
iland his friends haid gone so fir as t
'that. The Soutlhern people lhave
o certainly given evidence to the t
" world as being loyal to sentiment, a
I and steadfast to political princi
l- e, even under the most adverse
em aircumstances. They owe noth-l
.yling to the Republican party-noti
Ieven gratitnue of thle coImmonest l'
1kn, for that party has ieei thell
,hl bitter enemy of every cherished

Weather and Crops. a
At this present writing (Thursday, S
July 5th), the weather is hot, dry and p
disagrecable. The anxious farmer
vainly waits for a refreshing shower,
hopes from day to day that his pray
ers will tbe heard, and that he will be
blessed with seasonable rains, but
like other earthly aftairs beyond the
control of mortals, the shower cometh
not, and hope is deferred to make the
heart sick.
lThe highest range of the mercury
for this month thus far has been 9-1
degrees in the shade. This height
on the second and thidi; on the time
honored Fourth, the highest mark
was 930. Wc shiold not complain of
this, for in 0ll human probability
there is in store for us hotter weather
than this. hBut some people will coiim
plain, no matter what kind of weather
we have.
The piresent condition of the clop
is reported from ;ill sections of the
parish as bonus, muelior, optintus,(good,
better, be'st.) No planter says he has
a mean or "sorry" crop, but if asked
as to its condition, he replies that it
is good.
In some localities we hear of dam
age to the cotton, from the boll' worm,
but it really amounts to nothing.
Otaters say the plant is making "too
much weed," but this is by no mtans
general, and is con tined to a few spots
on certain plantations.
Others heve seen the eaterpil'lars
in alarming numbems, but on inquiry
it turns out that they have only seen
a few "forerunners" as they are called;
consequently no set ious damage is ap
prehended from this quarter.
All things considered we have the
prospect of gathering the largest crop
the coming fall that has been pro
duced in this parish since-well, as
the darkies say, since "reb times."
Everybody seems happy and content
ed, looking forward to the "good time
coming," dreaming of peace and'plen
