S3t6reed in the Papers of this
Great State.
Many of the country papers are drawing
comparison between the Senators from
.1ISatite. Senator Caflery is cited as an
examle for the Louisiana Democracy to
follow because he voted against the tariff
bil. We are far from indorsing Senator
McEnery's vote on that bill, but we greatly
prefer McEnery to Caffery when the general
interests of the State are concerned.-Mans
field Journal, Dem.
Congressman .Stephens, of Texas, has In
troduced a rather interesting bill in the
House. It is a joint resolution providing
for an amendment to the constitution, by a
vote of the several States, which will em
.power said States to levy an inheritance and
income tax, whose cash value shall exceed
$So,ooo. This bill is one of considerable
interest, and will unquestionably attract the
attention of the country when it properly
gets before the House. Mr. Stephers, by
the way, is one of- that class of bright men
who has come from the South, and is an ex
ccllent specimen and representative of the
"tre Democracy. We expect this bill will
receive, at the hands of Congress, the at
tention it deserves.-Iberville bouth, Dem.
This is the season of the year when Police
Juries are required to elect public printers,
and as might be expected, many of the
papers of the State are publishing heart
rending laments. It is surprisingly strange
that editors will cry over the loss of a little
public patronage as they do. Surely they
must have little to go on if the loss of a
little paltry parish printing will cause such
grief. A paper that depends for support on
the one or two hundred dollars dispensed
annually by a Police Jury is one that is en
titled to little sympathy, and is not a proper
channel through which to communicate with
the people. Whenever Truths's life be
comes dependent upon parish or municipal
patronage, we will hang a sign out with the
words "For sale or lease" inscribed thereon
and go out and raise cabbage and water
melons for a livelihood. Truth learned
long ago that when the Police Jury is of the
same political faction with itself its claim to
the printing will be considered, but when
the contrary is the case, the patronage will
go to some other fellow. And it believes
fnrther that this is right. We believe in
standing by those who stand by us, and that
of all the despicable creatures in this world
the political ingrate is the meanest.-Baton
Rouge Truth, Deanm.
The vote of two senators from Georgia
and two from South Carolina and one from
Louisiana for a duty on cotton is a striking
evidence of the decay of statesmanship in
the South and the surrender of two great
States to the Populists. Fortunately, Louis
iana has still one senator-Mr. Caffery
who aZetains true to his State, true to his
party imnd true to the interests of the people.
--Abbeville Meridional, Dem.
h jress of Louisiana can raise her pol
lie i the mire of fraud and corruption
in vr6h:it has now sunk, if the editors will
b.af the Independence, manliness, and
h t'y to take hold.-Shreveport Progress,
Dem.
Louisiana has two of the most conspicu
ous -representatives that ever faced the
United States Senate. To begin with, they
are able men, of mature years, with a politi
cal experience reaching back to the times
immediately proceeding the Civil War and
the reconstruction following it; and they are
on opposite sides of the same political party,
which creates an attraction that would not
exist otherwise.-Franklin News, Rep.
TheI Republicans are merely making a
grand stand play when they talk about go
ing after the armor plate trust or other
trust. If it were not for the trusts that
party would never have a chance of win
ning. The trusts furnish the money with
which to buy notes.-Lake Charles Ameri
ean, Deas.
There can be but one way for intelligent
people to act in politics, and that is to select
men to represent them who believe as they
do. If the majority believe in Republican
ddctihaei, elect Republicans and visa-versa.
If the majority believe in protection (as it
seems they do) why not vote for that party,
instead of howling one way while voting to
Sthe contrary ? No one has reasons to ex
-pect any representative to vote otherwise
than to sustain the doctrines taught by the
Sparty electing him. Instead of people kick
nfg abtnt Senator Cafery's vote, they
should ktick themselves for having hereto
fore voted contrary to their political belief.
That's about the size of it.-Franklin Vian
.dlmto, Rep.
-Illinois tried to drive the public schools to
be patriotic and it has backed down by re
pealkag the statute which required the con
tinuaous display of the stars aind stripes on
all public, parochial and private schools
during school hours. The moment you
force- patriotism, that moment patriotism
Iqo its force. Patriotism is good for
nothing unles it is spontaneous.o-Bossler
pa-uer, Dem.
Govertnor Pingree, of Michigan, is the
latest Republican of prominence to de
nounce the Dingley bill, and he predicts
:that the Republican party will have a
~rkonlag with the people which will be
deaidedly uanpleasant for the former. The
duty on hides, he says, will put millions of
dollars into the pockets of the Western beef
combine, which controls the hide market,
and that it will increase the price of shoes
S cents a Â·ilir, which will prove to be a
heavybC tax oafrmers and workingmen who

For seieral y ars there has been a disapo
iltion In the -South to criticize as unfair
school histories written in the North. The
position of the South in regard to the Civil
War, according to its partisans, was not
placed In the proper light by many writers,
who gave all the glory to the North and rig
idly excluded the slightest point in favor of
the Lost Cause or its supporters. As these
complaints grew the newspapers took the
matter up, and before long a vigorous cru
sade against Northern school histories was in
progress. The natural result was the ap
pearance of scores of school histories written
by Southern men from a strictly Southern
standpoint. Several of these books bore
the marks of hasty preparation, and nearly
all so extolled the Confederate cause and its
exponents and so magnified the achieve
ments of the Southern warriors and minim
ized tihpe of their enemies that the ex
Confederates themselves were quick to see
the folly of using them in the schools.
This, however, was not until after these
books had been favorably reviewed by the
Southern press and received grave sanction
from the pulpit.
It did not take long to demonstrate to the
Southern people that they had made a mis
take. In their resentment against what they
looked upon as slight from Northern school
book writers, they went to the other ex
treme, and their own good sense taught
them so.
The spirit of patriotism whih prevails
through the South was plainly evident from
action on the schoolbook question taken at
the recent reunion of ex-Confederte soldiers
at Nashville. A committee had been ap
pointed to investigate and report upon the
entire question. This committee sensibly
decided not to indorse or condemn any par
ticular book, and declared that its sole par
pose is to encourage truth in history. This
paragraph from the committee's report.
which received the indorsement of the re
union,shows the sentiment: "Nosectional his
tory is wanted in the schools of this country
and we desire no history taught in the
schools of the South but what ought to be
taught in the schools of the country every
where."
This declaration from the old soldiers
themselves ought to put a stop at once to
the foolish Southern school history and with
it the New England slurs upon the South.
The folly of teaching children what is not
true is recognized by the men, North and
South, who fought in the war, and school
boards should take heed of it and throw out
all books that fail to do justice to both
sides.
A man's wife dosen't have time to
be forever sewing buttons on his
pants, or sewing up pocket rips.
She won't have to take time, either,
if you wear the BUCKSKIN
BREECHES. We don't ask any
good wife to make good our ne
glect. If you get a pair of these
pants and they rip, take them back
to the dealer and get another pair.
That's what the guarantee in the
pocket means.
