tei T s speech.
So much for the prima facie ense.
The Senator's second point is that
we cannot inquire into the existence
of the State government, because
Kellogg's government has been re
cognized by the President. I have
said all that I care to about that.
Third, because it has been recog
nized by the supreme court ot Lou
isiana: and, fourth, because, it lias
existed de facto for more than a
year.
As to tho last proposition, the
length of time this government has
been in cxisteuce, that certainly
can add nothing to its title. We
know how it has beeu in existence.
It has not beeu iu existence by the
voluntary consent and assent of the
people of Louisiana. We know 1 lie
governor otthatState cried for help
in May last. üVe kuow that Fede
ral troops are in New Orleans to
day. We know that that govern
mcut lias been sustained by the
strong arm; of Federal military
power ever since Mr. Kellogg was
inaugurated. Now that the light
ing of this wrong has been so ioug
delayed, that a Legislature has
been pretending to pass laws, ami
rights are supposed to have become
vested under them are inconveni
eu cos very great, I concede, wliicli
should induce Congress carefully
to consider whether, under all the
circumstances, it is best to do this
or that, or to do nothing; but on
the question I am discussing—the
rightfulness of this government—I
sny whether it be upheld there by
Federal force on® year or five is
immaterial If it be a legal govern
ment, it was so the day it was set
up. If it was not then, it is not
now; and we understand how it
has been held up from that time to
this.
Eut let mo say a few words in re
gard to these remarkable decisions
of the State court of Louisiana.
The Senator says we are bound by
them. Ho refers to the settled
doctrine that in the Federal judi
cial courts a a line of decisions of a
State court setting a principle of
local law is always followed when
the Federal courts pass upon the
same question. He must be equal
ly well aware that that rule r.ule is
subject to a good many important
exceptions, and one of these is, that
if the decisions of the State court
are not harmonious, the-Federal
courts will follow that decision
which it considers most consonant
with sound principle. This îias
been over and over again determin-j
ed*by the Supreme Court.
Let me say, however, before
coming to this, that ihe ground
upon which the judicial courts of
the Union follow the decision of
the State courts is that an act of
Congress has prescribed the State
laws as a rule for decisions in the
Federal courts in cases where they
apply ; and in ascertaining what
the State law is, the decisions of
the State court, if they aro uni
form, and have been continued
through a series of years and been
respected by the bench and bar of
the State, are taken to be the high
est evidence of what the local law
is; but not so if they are inconsis
tent. The Supreme Court of the
United States, iu the case of the
Ohio Lite and Trust Company vs.
DeboM, Id Howard, 432, and again
in Gelpecké vs. Dubuque, 1 Wal
lace, J 75, and iu Havemeyer vs.
Iowa County, 3 Wallace, 2Ù4, and
iu many other cases that might be
cited, have established this excep
tion to the rule, that if the decis
ions of the State court are not cou
siktent, the Federal court will fol
low those which they regard cor
rect in principle:
I u ndertake to say that any man
who will take the decisions render
ed by the Supreme Court of Louisi
nna, commencing in may, 1.^72—
the two decisions which I read.here
yesterday—and the decisions which
they have made since this contest
arose, will tind it impossible to en
tertain the slightest respect for
anything that court can declare.
In the case which 1 read from yes
terday they hehl in words that the
attempted removal ot Bovee by
Governor Warmoth was an abso
lute nullity; that he never ceased
to be Secretary of State lor one
moment; that Herron, tho man he
appointed as his successor, never
was Secretary of State at all. And
to decide between the two canvass
ing boards—lhe Lynch board and
tho Warmoth board—because it
was necessary to sustain tho Lynch
board, they decided exactly the re
verse. I will try to find that de
cision, as it so well illustrates what
I mean. Bear in mind that this
court, six months before this elec
tion was held, and when there was
no contest, no temptation to do any
tiling wrong, had held that War
moth's attempt to remove Bovee
was an absolute nullity; that his
attempt to appoint Herron was ab
solutely void ; that Herron never
was .secretary ot stale, and could
perform none of the duties of sec
retary of state exept the routine
business of the ofiiee, and as to
whether he could do even that they
declined to express an opinion.
Now see the attitude in which
the court is placed. In May they
they decided that Bovee was not
removed and ilerron never was
Secretary of State. In December,
when it was necessary to sustain
the other side ot the question, thov
decide that Herron wns secretary
ot state, and that the governor,
who hfid removed Bovee as secre
tary of state and appointed Herron,
hau no -■ ■ V i remove. Ilerron
•t"d amyint Wharlou ; that >, Le
yet, when they came subsequently
had less power over his own ap
pointee than he had over the secre
tary of state elected by the people.
To understand the absurdity of
this decision, I should remind the
Senate that after the governor did
put Bovee out and put Herron in
Bovee commenced a suit against
Herron, charging that ho had in
truded into the- office. They fixed
that up, Governor Wariuotli, if I
recollect aright, appointing a judge
to try the case; and that judge de
cided in the court below that it was
legal for the governor to remove
the secretary of state and appoint
Herron.
Bovee failed to take his appeal
within the time fixed by law, and
when the case reached the supreme
court the appeal was dismissed for
this irregularity. So the judgment
of the court below remained in
force as between the parties. Now,
whom did this judgment bind?
Every lawyer knows that if it
bound anybody it bound Bovee and
Ilerron only, and- them only be
cause they were parties to the re
cord. An erroneous judgment ren
dered by a court of competent ju
risdiction binds the parties to the
record and their privies, but it
binds nobody else. Now see the
beauty of this remark of the court,
that, in consequence of that erro
neous decision "as to the world
Ilerron was secretary of state."
They have just reversed the fact.
As to all tho world he was not sec
retary of State. As to Bovee,
touching the question of salary,
for instance, Herron was secretary
ot state. Why ? Because that
judgment, although erroneous,
bound Bovee, he being a party to
the record, but it bound nobody
else. But they say that that errô
"neous judgment as to all the world
made Herron the secretary of state,
who, as they had 1 decided six
months before, never was secretary
of state at all ; and they held that
Herron, who had been put in by
this hocus poeus, was in so fast
that even Warmoth could not get
him out, and the only ground upon
which Warmoth. could get him iu
was that lie had removed tho man
the people had elected ; and yet
he could not remove his own a\>
pointeo.
when the
If anybody wishes further to
pursue the decisions of this court,
let him turn and read—for I lack
the patience to do it—the case of
Bovee vs. Herron, 24 Annual, 595;
ana if any lawyer will take the 0 so
cases, read the decisions made
hen the judicial mind was un
clouded by temptation, when no
contest w;i s pending, no necessity
existing lor an erroneous decision,
holding expressly that ITerron nev
er was secretary of state., and could
do no act :is secretary of state, and
then turn to the decisions made six
months later by the same court,
and can entertain the slightest re
spect for that court, either its in
telligence or its integrity, I® yield
the palm to him ; I cannot.
But, Mr. President, there is an
other very rich thiug in this con :
nection. The Senator from Indiana
says that we are estopped; we, the
Senate, pursuing' an investigation
which the Constitution lays upon
us, aro estopped to inquire into the
facts because the courts of Louisi
ana have settled them. New the
same, supreme court of Louisiana
in two cases have held aud they
were driven to hold that to avoid
overturning Kellogg's government
altogether that they had no author
ity in any case to go back of the
decisiono f tho returniug board. I
hold in my hand a pamphlet, which
was laid .before our committee by
M. Marr, and which contains, or is
said to contain, opinions of the su
preine court iu cases decided siuco
the reports have been publised.
This pamphlet was, however, con
ceded to be a truthful statement
of t lie se decisions.
This matter ought not to be
lightly passed by. I wish some one
was treating this subject now who
could do justice to this poiut. I
am not equal to it. But consider
tills proposition. There was a con
test growing out of this very elec
tion ; Lhe court below erroneously
thought that an election rested
upon tho votes and not upon tho
certificate ; they therefore opened
the quest ion as to who was elected,
and the Kellogg man was beaten
because his opponent was proved
to 1erc reo» ived more V" c-% To**
The case was appealed to the su
preme court, and the supreme
court held that no judicial tribunal
in that State had authority to in
quire into the fact of an election,
but that the canvass by the board
and tho commission of the governor
were conclusive. So they reversed
the judgment, and conferred the
office upon- the candidate proved
to have received the fewest votes.
Now, the Senator from Indiana
maintains that when the Senate,
pursuing the lino of its constitu
tional duty, reaches the question
whether Kellogg and his associates
are tho legal State officers and his
legislature has been duly elected,
we aro estopped, because the su
preme court of Louisiana has set
tled that they are ; although that
that court themselves declare they
have no jurisdiction to determine
that question. The determination
of a court having no jurisdiction to
inquire is made conclusive upon an
inquiry as to which the Constitu
tion makes us the exclusive judges.
This is one of tho healthy legal
propositions which the Senator
from Indiania is drive» to maiu
tain.
31k. Morton .—Docs the Senator
think now that ho states tho case
fuily i
Mr. Carpenter.—I know 1
state it as fully as is necessary to
the decision ol this question.
Mr. Morton . The supreme court
of Louisiana in that case decided
that they could not go into tho
buesticn as to who was elected,
because there was auother tribunal
created by the law to determine
that question—a special tribunal
created by the laws of Louisiana
for 0 that purpose, and they are
boûnd by the decision of that
tribunal. That tribunal is tho re
turning board. But they do not
decide who constitute the return
ing board, and when they have
decided that they say they cannot
go behind the decision of that re
turning board, because the jurisdic
tion is confered upon that board to
make the returns. That is all ot
it.
Mr. Carpenter . And that is
a good deal more than there is of
it, too. Then the revised position
of the Senator is this : We sot out
here to inquire as to the existence
of certain officers ; we are estopped
in that inquiry because tho su
preme court of the State have sot
tied it; and now he says that the
supreme court have said they had'
no jurisdiction to inquire into it bo
cause some other tribunal had.
Weli, I do not care what is the
reason that tho supreme court can
not inquire into it ; ail that it is
necessary for mo to make out in
order to show-that their decision
cannot bind us, is that tho court
making the decision had no juris
diction to inquire into tho facts.
If the Senator chooses to rest that
want of power to inquire upon one
ground instead of another, it is all
the same to nit®; but still I main
tain that we cannot be bound by
the decision of a court of jurisdic
tion to inquire into the question
0 whieli wo must decide.
Mr. Morton . They had juris
diction to decide which was tho
board, anddid decide if.
M r . Carpenter . They had juris
diction to repeat, parrot-like, as the
Senator lias none after them ; and
so all thoso questions, from the
right of a Senator of the United
States down to the right of every
parish officer in Louisiana, aro to
bo settled by a false return, proved
false in every court that has ever
investigated it ; kuown to bo false
by every man who has ever examin
ed it i proved false by tho very
met who made it, and known by
tho Senator himself to be an uu
paralled fraud ; and that false can
vass has estopped the State courts,
estoped us, and everything is con
cluded by a fraud which is confes
sed on ail hands and« laid bare by
an investigation fa committee of
this body. s

BY BROOaLSTRAW.
Sam-Collins was bound to have
a spree. He had sold his boat
load of flour, received the money,
and intended to indemnify him
self for the labor and hard life of a
flat-boat ; so lie laid off fifty dollars,
to see New Orleans. In the hands
of an exquisite, at'a first-class hotel,"
with wines, dinners, ^operas, and
their consequences, fifty dollars
would go a very short distance ;
while the same sum would go a
good way in cheap brandy, theater
tickets, corporation fines,-'and the
catalogue of amusements appro
priate to them.
Without doubt, Sam would have
made out his week, and have been
dragged aboard au up-river boat,
by some more careful colleague,
but that his fifty dollars came to a
premature end.
Among other tastes which he had
acquired about the boat-yard, on
the head waters of tho noble Ten
nessee, was an indiscrimiante par
tiality lor all games of chance. He
was not only versed in all tho arts
of " short cards," but had attacked
all fancy amusements which came
along, from the faro dealer, in his
buggy, to the more humble thimble
rigger, who paused in the tavern
porch long enough to collect a few
dimes from tho unwary.
Having limited himself to a cer
tain sum, Mr. Collins reflected that
if lie could only " git a streak agin
some of them d—d games," he could
„extend his stay in " Orleans" to an
indefinite period, at the expense of
tho gamblers. So, after fixing up,
with the assistance of his friends,
he set off to find a game. He
played against tho faro bank, got
into a row with a bystander, who
refused to drink with him, and was
turned out, after a great row, and
obstinate resistance on Iiis part;
in the course of which ho knocked
down his antagonist, and received
a slight wound on tho shoulder.
His valorous boatmen carried him
off, swearing vengeance against
their " d—d bone-mill." Ho was,
however, appeased by an introduc
tion to an elegant apartment, where
the gamo of rouge et noir was con
ducted, by some silent and genteel
Frenchmen. There were very few
persons in the room, so Sam drank
claret fthey had nothing else,] as
long as ho had room for it ; but tho
whole affair was Ghocktaw to him.
After a few words, which were
quite unintelligiablo to him, thoy
paid him a dollar. Then came
some more gibberish, when they
raked down tivo dollars. It was a
dull afiair—ho understood not a
word, knew nothing of the game,
and was rapidly drinking himself
and party sobe.i. Besides, ho be
gun to learn that it was a losing
game. So, as the place was too
quiet, genteel and expensive for
the party, they left. With the ex
ception of a slight scuffle with some
watchman, they met with no other
adventure, until they reached the
purlieus of the city, and saw, to
their great delight, tho congenial
beams of a red lantern, iu a low
doggery. Here they -felt perfectly
at home. They called for liquor,
made proclamation of their united
and several capacities to "lick the
city," or any of its citizens, and
made the acquaintance of a very
" peaceable" little man, who soon
led the way to a room in which
there was a now davice, with which
Sam was charmed. Amongst other
games going on there, were several
tables, ornamented with horizontal
wheels, tho edges whereof, as well
as thoso ot tho circular box in
which tho wheel was inclosed; was
fitted with little tin pockets, - num
bered to.correspond with the figure*,
painted upon an oil-cloth, spread
on a table. The person who bet,
placed his money upon any number
lie liked; the wheel was put in
rapid motion, and a marble wa»|
thrown upon-its surface, when ihej
impetus given tho wheel was ex
haustod, the marble, of course,
stopped in one of the little pockets.
If the number of that pocket cor-j
responded with that upon which
the better had placed his money,
ho received a considerably larger.
amount ot money than he had pur;'
down, if it did nor, t-j.-Yespond. o."
course lie low Iiis stake, our
friends soon comprehended this
game. They drank strychnine Whis :
ky, and followed the marble in its
rapid revolutoa, until they were
perfectly giddy. They were quite
at homo, and formed acquaintances •
from every ilatboat at the levee ;
but tho deamou of discord again
disturbed their enjoyment. Two
boatmen began to squabble about
a bet. This soon grew to a fight,
in which Sam and his merry men
took an active part. This resulted
in a call of tho police, and tho ex
tinguishment of tho lamps and, as
Tarn O'Shanter has it*
" la an instant all was dark."
The game and tho gamblers had
disappeared when the police en
tered ; but notwithstanding they
made a desperate resistance, tho
police marched them off to the
Calaboose.
Upon the examination of wit
nesses, it appeared that Sàm and
his mou had beeu druuk and dis
orderly, and they were accordingly
fined. This somewhat reducod
Sam's " pile ;" but then lie had " no
showiu' agin the perleese."
Upon being discharged, tho par
ty found that it was broad day ; so,
having adjourned to qji eating
house, they refresed themselves
with drink, oysters, aud a row
with tho bar-keeper ; but as he did
not possess sufficient muscle to af
ford any one of them a decent fight,
Sam interferrcd and restored peace.
It was now 10 o'clock, and Sam
began to long for " something
fresh." Accordingly, ho set out,
accompanied by one or two of his
party. For a while, tliey saw
nothing but nursery-maids "and.
children. After awhile, however, a
man appeared, who attracted their
their particular attention. He wore
a green baize jacket, and bent be
neatli the weight ot a large box,
which was also covered with baize.
He set down his. box, removed the
cover, and revealed to the admiring
gaze of the boatmen, a mahogany
case—much resembling an old-lash
ioned " seretary"—and opening a
door, revealed " a small, but select"
collection of puppets—some repre
senting kings, others " emineuts
tragedians," tight rope performers,
etc. But the crowning glory of all
was an equestrian, whoso aristio
excellence bewildered and charmed
the jolly boatmen.
Presently the " Professor" chang
ed the tune to " Dance, boatmen,
da nee!" Regarding this as an in
vitation they did dance, in a style
which quite astonished tho proprie
tor of the organ.
Suddenly, Sam paused.
"Boys," said he, "you are makin'
blasted fools of yourself. Don't
you see them ladies laughing at
you?" [lie referred to tho nursery
maids.] " you don't understand
tho ways oi this town. This is one
of the new-fashioned games—ain't
it, Mr. Showman ?"
Tho uian nodded assent.
"There, didn't 1 tell you soî
You cau't fool me. I'd go a half on
this.'ero"—placing the money on
tho box opposite tho clown.
The man ground out tho few
remaining bars of tho tune, aud
swept oit tho half.
" Blast tho luck !" said Sam,
"Now I'll bet right hero in tho
square."
The man changed his stops, aud
looked first at Sam, and thou at
his five dollar gold piece.
" O, turn on—I'll go-it all !" said
Sam. "Boys, Jot's break the bank!"
Accordingly, other bets wore
soo: made.
At tho conclusion) of the tune,
tho organ-grinder secured all tho
money/
" Why, boys, 7 ' said Sam, "this is
worse than cnuck-a-iuck. j haven't
won a bet !"
■" > or mo !" " Ifor. mo 1" said tho
other-.
" Well, boys, I'm broke," said
Sam." " Can any of you stake mo?"
Thoy were all "dead broke."
" Well, stranger,? said Sam,
*' ; we're in bad luck, and can't play
any more against yoltr game."
The Italian bowed very politely,
and continued hin performance.
"Oh! you.might as weil kuock
oli'—you can't v. iu no more."
Tho music soon stoped- The
Italian, satisfied with the patron
age oi'tho boatmen, shouldered his
organ and set oit to charm other
imi*v-i*y-ma.iis ; .»no iit-.'<*!' again
