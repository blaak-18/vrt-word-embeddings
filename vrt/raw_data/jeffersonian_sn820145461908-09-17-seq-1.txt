VOLUME THREE.
NUMBER THIRTY-EIGHT
Two numbers back, in this maga
zine, I spoke biographically of Mr.
Bryan. I said his earliest Washing
ton appearance “was in November,
1891”—note the date —and that he
made his Congressional debut, when
he entered the Democratic caucus to
assist in selecting the party’s candi
date for speaker. There were Mes
srs. Mills, and Crisp, and McMillan,,
and Hatch, and Springer in the cau
cus lists. The battle began; Mr. Bry
an voting for Mr. Springer. The war
raged for hours; ballot on the hocks
of ballot. Mr. Hatch withdrew in
favor of Mr. Crisp. Mr. Springer
withdrew in favor of Mr. Crisp. Mr.
Crisp won in the last of it over Mr.
Mills by two votes, I think.
As related, Mr. Bryan voted in the
beginning for Mr. (Springer. After
Mr. Springer withdrew, he still voted
for Mr. Springer. That gentleman
was himself out of the race, and on
the caucus floor, voting for Mr. Crisp.
Yet to the final roll call, which gave
victory by a meagre brace of votes
to Mr. Crisp, Mr. Bryan went wasting
his vote.
Later, when asked why he thus
threw himself away in a contest
where the second office of the gov
ernment was at bay, Mr. Bryan gave
as his reason that Messrs. Mills and
Crisp were ex-Confederates, and that
he, Mr. Bryan, didn’t care for the
record of having supported any gen
tleman thus distinguished. In short,
Mr. Bryan, to dodge what he thought
a danger, threw away his vote.
“The caucus rolls will show,” I
said. “If they be lost, then the files
of that day’s newspapers will show.
Mr. Bryan’s excuse was the Confed
erate past of Messrs. Mills and
Crisp. If he contradict the latter
statement, let him give the true rea
son. Let him tell why he wasted his
vote, in an hour pregnant of Presi
dencies and party issues and many
giant public things beside.”
Thaf, in word and substance, was
what I printed. Among others it
seems to have excited a gentleman,
name unknown, because suppressed,
in Greenville, South Carolina. This
anonymous gentleman, carefully fix
ing the caucus as one held in 1894 —
when there was no caucus, and
couldn’t have been a caucus —and
avoiding “1891,” the date I had giv
en, wrote Mr. Bryan asking if the
tale were true, courteously saying at
the same time that he “did not be
lieve’.’ it —as if his belief could by
any possibility have become import
ant.
Thereupon, Mr. Bryan, with fine
strategy, put forward The Common-
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
SYK. LEWIS BRYAN.
Atlanta, Ga., T’ ursday, September 17, 1908
er, his paper, which writing thro,
“J. R. Karris, iSupt.,” spa-ke via t.
U. S. mails as follows:
“Lincoln, Neb., July 6, 1908.
“Dear Sir:
“Your kind favor of June 30, di
rected to Mr. W. J. Bryan, received.
While it is impossible for him to
make personal reply, owing to the
press of work, I beg to say in his
behalf that the charge which you
mention has been answered several
times. Mr. Bryan voted for Mr.
Crisp three times —once in the cau
cus and twice on roll call in the
House. He voted for 'Congressman
Springer in the House, buk he did
not refuse to vote for Mr. Crisp be
cause he was a Confederate, he voted
for Mr. 'Springer because he lived in
his district and because he knew him
well. *
“Mr. 'Springer voted for Mr. Crisp
in the caucus and he became Chair
man of Resolutions.
“Mr. Bryan not only voted for Mr.
Crisp, but in 1893 he voted for an
ex-Confederate for Postmaster; Mr.
J. D. Calhoun was the man and he
now lives l>mpa, Fla. He was
willing to have an <?x-Confederate
run with him in 1896, and he has on
numerous occasions stated that no
question oi a man’s position in the
war between the states will be raised
at this time. Yours truly,
“THE COMMONER,
“By J. R. Farris, Supt.”
This stuff, by The Commoner,
through its well informed “iSupt.,”
Mr. Farris, is so full of foolish errors
as to be hardly worth attention. Mr.
Farris, you observe, explains labo
riously that Mr. Bryan voted for Mr.
Springer “because he lived in his dis
trict” —when one was from Nebras
ka and the other from Illinois —pro-
viding the cheerful inference that
one district at least possessed the
House advantage of two representa
tives. He then adds the unusual
piece of news that Mr. Springer was
made “Chairman of Resolutions”
whatever that may mean. At a time
and place, too, when there were no
resolutions and no committee thereon.
The well-informed Mr. F., contin
uing for The Commoner, then vouch
safes the interesting information that
in 1893 Mr. Bryan “voted for an ex-
Confederate for Postmaster,” and so
sets the world to wondering when
the office of Postmaster became elect
ive.
However, poking about in this rub
bish of misstatement and misinforma?
tion, it is clear that it may be taken
to be the manner in which Mr. Bryan
chooses to meet the charge I made.
much true, let me offer a plain
ment in return.
*°Mr. Crisp was speaker twice. He
was selected as the caucus candidate,
and subsequently elected Speaker of
the House, in 1891 and 1893.
In the latter year, he had in caucus
no opposition. He was selected by
acclamation, and Mr. Bryan, under
those less fear-inspiring circum
stances, may have voted for him. I
think this the more likely, since, the
nomination being by acclamation,
there would be no roll-call and no rec
ord.
But in the caucus of 189.1, the first
caucus that selected Mr. Crisp, Mr.
Bryan did not vote for him. From
first to last he wasted his vote on Mr.
Springer, who in the latter half of
the contest had withdrawn, was not
before the caucus as a candidate, and
was himself on the caucus floor vot
ing for Mr. Crisp.
When I asked Mr. Bryan, perhaps
fwn months later, why he thus threw
away his choice, he said:
“Did it ever occur to you that
both Air. Mills and Ml Crisp were
ex-Confederates ? ’ ’
“What of that?” I replied. “What
difference should that make?”
“It might make a good deal of dif
ference,” Mr. Bryan returned, “in
the country I come from. I don’t
know as I care to go back, and face
an old soldier element along the
Platte, with the record of having
voted for an ex-Confederate. ”
That was the way he put it, spirit,
substance and phrase.
And now to you of Greenville —or
anywhere else —who are interested:
Why don’t you go about your investi
gations in a half-wise way? Get the
caucus rolls, the rolls for 1891; not
those for 1893, or for 1894 —when
there wasn’t any caucus. If you
can’t get the caucus rolls, have the
files of such papers as the New York
World, or the Washington Post or
Star examined.
When you find —as you will —that
Mr. Bryan, in that caucus of 1891,
wasted his vote on Mr. Springer—
wasted it to the final roll call —
wasted it when Mr. Springer was not
a candidate —ask him, if he says the
ex-Confederate pasts of Messrs. Mills
and Crisp were not the reason of
such waste, to tell you the real rea
son. He must have had some reason
for throwing away his "vote, when a
House gavel was being disposed of
by a majority of two. Folk don’t
throw away their votes for fun, or
through mere caprice, or in a spirit
of airy facetiousness. Therefore, have
Mr. Bryan tell you why he crawled
out on the Springer limb and re
mained there throughout that caucus
fight of 1891.
Afr. Bryan says, or rather the very
lucid Mr. Farris says for him, that
he “voted for Mr. Crisp three times
—once in caucus and twice on roll
call in the House.”
Os course he voted for Mr. Crisp
in the House; every Democrat did;
the vote was a formality. Os course
he voted for Air. Crisp twice in the
House —once in 1891 and again in
1893. Os course he voted for Mr.
Crisp in caucus; it was that caucus
which did the trick by acclamation,
the caucus of 1893.
Observe the veracious albeit mud- .
dler Air. Farris only speaks of “once
in the caucus.” And yet, if Mr.
Bryan voted for Air. Crisp “twice on
roll-call in the House,” there must
have been two caucuses; since it only
takes one roll-call of the House to
choose a speaker, after the caucus
has settled upon the name.
What was Air. Bryan’s action in x
the other Crisp caucus?
Air. Farris doesn’t say.
Let me say it for him, repeating
what I wrote before: Air. Bryan in
the other Crisp caucus, the
caucus of 1891, threw away his
vote on one who wasn’t a
candidate, refraining from support
ing Mr. Crisp or Air. Mills —the
only two in the fight—on the grounds,
as he himself gave out, that “he
didn’t care to face an old soldier
element along the Platte, with the
record of having voted for an ex-
Confederate. ’ ’
In conclusion let me add that,
personally, I care very little about
this matter. I wouldn’t cross the
street to elect or defeat Air. Bryan.
As a newspaper man, I have been
trained to remember events. As a
politician, Air. Bryan has been train
ed to forget them, and to hope that
others will forget them, in every
case wherein they carry peril.
Also, at the time Air. Bryan—for
an ex-Confederate reason —behaved
so cautiously, you are not to forget
that the frontiers of his ambitions,
and per incident his hopes and fears,
were the boundaries of that district
“along the Platte.” The presidency
was am after thought—dong after.
In 1891 he couldn’t foresee what
would be his needs in 1908. Where
fore, he did —as he always has done,
is doing, and always will do—trimmed
his sail to match the breeze of the
moment, to the end that his craft
be neither retarded nor capsized.—
