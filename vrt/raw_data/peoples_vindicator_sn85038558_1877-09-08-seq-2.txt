Who are ResIponiiile for It .
The ()nachita parish Teh'lra ph
tell us that .Jlilge 1,aker, a noto
rious Iadiea] of tlhat section whomi
decent opinion expelled fr' a
time, has returned with a view to
then rgaizatioll of the ll"Workinig
man's Party."
We suppose the idiots, even of
Louisiana's "patriotic hamd" unn
derstand what that means, andl
who working mieni are in a negro
parish.
We have warned our people all
along about these Illows, and our
warnings have now proof that t
they shouil. have been heeded. t
The moment these fellows were
assured of protection for past
crimes ; the very hour they were
convinced that the Courts might
con,,viet, but they would never be
punished, to work they went in
order to retrieve that which they c
had lost by a united opposition of
the whites of the State.
Is this so of any other South- e

game, when the degredation of his

Hampton does not desire a State
Convention at present to frame
a State Constitution, because he J,
desires first, to make official mnal

er to be honest than otherwise.
How is it in this Statei tli
Our officials are of the maudlin v
sentimental stripe, (we will not a"
say they are Uriah Heapish, al- iU
though they look like it) and
when honest Courts attempted to
do their duty in one instance,
there was interference at once.
Neither do they want the organic
law, the source of all our ills,
changed, rather wonld they con- To
tinne to place the liberties of the
people of Louisiana in a situa
tion to be constantly menace(d by
those who, but a short six months
ago, raped law and decency in
the full Iblaze of (lay.
A people can lose liberty by yea
trusting it to the keeping of a dot
weak man, and Louisianian's had
better arouse to a sense of their
danger at once. the
The questions asked by those ical
who have brains to see the danger
is, as to the conduct of those of -im
ficials whom they elected. Is this IIic
conduct the result of idliotcy, or s
of demagoguery? There can be lars
