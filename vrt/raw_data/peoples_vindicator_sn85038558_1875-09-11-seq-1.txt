Suicide of Ralston, President of
the Bank of California.
'fThe following account of the dis
appearance of the President of the
t suspended Bank of California, is taken
. from the Cincinnati Commercial of the
28th, to which it was written on the
day of tihe failure :
About ten minutes past 5 o'clock,
Ia carriage drove rapidly to a sidedoor
i of the Banki offCalifornia, and a gentle
man jumped out in a state of excite
ment and ran into the bank. In res.
ponse to inquiries, he said he had
'just left the body of Ralston,in charge
I of an officer on the beach, near the
Smelting Works, in the northern part
of the city, drowned; supposed sui
cide. Further particulars soon.
Later - Ralston rode to Selby's
Smelting Works' wharf and jumped
Soff the deck.
8. P. M.-There is great excite.
w ment in the city. The death of Ral
ston overshadows every other topic.
a From the best information it ap
, pears he went to the sea-bathing es
tablishinent at North Beach about 3:
25 P. M., nearessed, went into the
- water, swam about two hundred yards
a disappeared behind a vessel, and soon
n after the body was discovered float
n m by the Selby Lead Work. It was
brought ashore still alive. Phys
icians were summoned, but their ef
t forts to resuscitate him failed.
Sle died at ten minutes to 5 o'clock.
Col. Fry, his father-inu-law, Mayor
Otis and i number of prominent citi
zens arrived before he expired. Cok
a Fry and Capt. Lees went to the bath
| ung-house and obtained Mr. Ralston's
clothes.. In these were found a few
dollars and his statement to the bank,
but nothing having a tendency to
a show that he committed suicide. The
- body was ounveyed.to No. 1812 Jack.
son street, the residence of Col. Fry.
A boy, psained Featus Maszele states
Stali.t he saw Mr. Raistop before he
e; diihed the bathlotiolse"g haw himnt sit
oa the clay bank near the smelting
work; saw him tear up several pa
pers and throw the scraps into the
'* water., A close search was made for
e the pieces,' but none could be found.
SHe is ala. reported to have been mseen
to dridunk the contents of a plial before
going uto the water. Tie geuemal
impression is that he took poieon be
t fore entering the water.
SThe board of directors of the Bank
of California held a meeting to-day.
Ralston was requested to resign as
President and dizector, which hlie did.
As regards the finanocial ptrospeet,
r in thie best informed circles it is be
lieved all the banks will go on with
out further trouble, and that the Na
Stional Gold Bank Trust Company and
the Merchanuts' Exchahage Bank will
. resume Monday.
The town is fullor rumorse, and the
street at this hour (8 P. M.) is crowd
' ed with people. It is understood that,
Sowing to the excited feeling manifest
e ed, arrangements have been made to
.callout the military to preserve or

r How they Rent Farms in Texas.
, Mr. W. G. Kingsbury, the Texas
State Emigration Agent in St. Louis,
rwrites to the Repsblion iJn that city,
that a large number of planters in
ITexas, in order to secure a good elass
of touenants, have agreed to the follow
ing very liberal terms: They will fur
Snish the land under a good fence;
Scomfortable houses; all necessary
teams and feed for amme; all tools,
Y and keep the same in repair, all seed
i an firewood; a garden plot; and
r generally a suflicient naumber of cows
,f fr nailk and butter for the family-
i all these they will furniash free, the
if tenant to do the work and divide the
g crop halt aid half after it is gathered.
After the tenant is fairly settled upon
i the land and mnaking a reasonshle
Seshow of work, the planter will make
· advancea for the actual, neeeaities of
Slife, such as meat atid bread for film
self and family, but these are to be
Spaid foitr from the sale of tihe crop.
I The planter will also meet tihe te
anat t the depot with his temnom and
transport his family and efects to the
Sfarm free of coat. Mr. Kingabury
k says he has the names of several bhu
f dred farmers in Texas wihoe wish to
Sprocure tenantsor these very liberal
iterms which he will farlah to all ap.
y pboauts, timat the two parties may uen

'Farm and Household ColisI.
Experiaerta is Deep sad abllse
Setllhg of Milk.-Mach dis sese
has been had hfro tiue to tdlia
regard to the best results tobe em
tuned in setting milk deep or sabal
low, aud although the question is net
yet fully settled bttween the advo
cates of the two eystemns, it would
appear that the bulk of the testimony
farvos the latter system as to quanti
ty vbile the deep setting gives the
best results. In Farrand's experi
ment it took on the first trial, with
milk deep set in pails, 27 pounds of
milk for I of butter; and shallow in
pans, 25 pounds of milk for 1 pound
of butter. In the second trial, 25
pounds I$ ounces of milk set in pails
gave 1 pound of butter, while in pans
only 24 pounds 10 ounces were re
quired. In the third experiment it
took 27 pounds 13 ounces of milk set
in pails and 25 pounds 2 ounces of
milk in pans, respectively to make a
pound of butter. The milk was set
in pails to the depth of from 7 to 12
inches, and that in pans from 2 to
21 inches, and skimmned in from 36 to
48 hours. Franklin Hooker, of Ver
mont, tried the experiment by first
mixing the milk thoroughly and then
setting one half in, pails and the other
half in pans. The milk stood 46
hours before skimming, and the re
sult was that it took 27 pounds 14
ounces of milk set in pails for I pound
of butter, while that set in pans gave
1 pound of butter from 22 pounds I
ounce of milk.

be cured almost sure if taken in any
kind of time. First-Rub powerful

the Ihair on the rtop and side of the
head. Third--Call for a bucket of
water as hot as can be bornae, and
