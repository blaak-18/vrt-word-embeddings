A number of gentlemen met in
Abbeville the other day presumably
to formulate a plan to defeat Dis

that no one could be decided upon
as an opponent to Mr. Gordy.
Some were for Mr. Bourges, some
for Mr. Campbell, while others
were in favor of Mr. Chargois. For
Judge the meeting was, we are in
formed, unanimous for Mr. Julian
Mouton. From this incident it
may be seen that there is not any
more opposition to Mr. Gordy in
Vermilion than in this parish.

The following is a special from
Abbeville to The Times-Democrat
of Sept. ag. '*The first effort to set
the political pot to boilng in this
parish was made here yesterday
evening when a few politicians as- i
sembled behind closed doors for
the purpose of formulating some
plan to beat the present district at- I
torney, Mr. M. T. Gordy, for re-el
ection to office. Matters of state
were also discussed, but as there
were representaives piesent from
about all the known political par-;
ties, and as every one conld not
have his man mentioned, there was
discord in the ranks and it broke
up in a turmoil. I

Mr. Mouton Resigns.
The citizens of our town will
learn with sincere regret that Mr.
F. V. Mouton, the courteous and
affable T. & P. agent here, has
sent in his resignation and will
leave for h;s old home, Liafayette,
about the middle of next month.
He has accepted a position in the
Peoples Bank at his ,ld home. Mr.
Mouton has made many warm
friends during his stay in Plaque
mine and in leaving will carry with
him their best wishes for future
success.
The South also predicts for our
esteemed and valued friend a bril

merit always wins.-Iberville South.

Lafayette has a 'eal sensation in
the shape of a brai hew jetrified
man that Alphonse Peck found
Thursday morning in the woods on
Horace Broussard's place about two
miles from town. Anybody who
has heard Peck tell about his ghast
ly fi. d is convinced of the genuine
ness of the discovery. Mr. Peck
and Ralph Duhon where walking
toward the bayou, when the former
stumbled against something which
proved to be the toes of a man.
Of course, he was at first awe
stricken at the sight of such an un
usual thing. He called Duhon's
attention to it and :hen a Ivanced a
little nearer. He scraped th- dirt
from around what he was soon con
vinced was the foot of a man. A
spade was procured and one can
easily imagine the surp ise of
Mcssrs. Peck and Duhoni when they
dug'out the body of a man hard as
stone. As petrified bodies are
rather uncommon things in this
part of Uncle Sam's comain the
news spread rapidly. In a few
hours a number of people from this
town and Breaux Bridge were on
the scene. Among those, who came
from the latter plice were two
physicians who unhesitatingly
pronounced the body that
of a human being. It is 5 feet so
inches and of perfect build; an '
weighs about 450 pounds. Save a
hole in the abdomen and one on
each thigh there isn't the least frac
tu'e discernible on the whole body.
Some thought that the face bore the
features of an Indian while others
were of the opinion that there was
no doubt as to the body being that
of a white matt. The hands, whic.
were placed just above the breast
in the regular way for burial, are
perfect in every particular; the
traces on the fingers and the finger
nails are exceptionally well marked.
The moustache gives the upper lip
the appearance of extra thickness.
and an eye-tooth sticks out. The
checks protrude like those of an
Indian and the forehead looks also
like that of the red man.
In the afternoon Messrs. Ralph
Duhon and Horace Broussard
brought the stone-man to Peck's
saloon where a large crowd so',n
congregated. Mr. Peck iuformned
us that the body woultl be washed
and placed on exhibuition when
eeerybodly will have an opportunity
to see it.
At Koyville.
A stiff norther has been blow
ing through our whiskers all the
week. The hot spell is about
broken; fine weather has set in.
Ginners are having a little war all
'-entre eux." So effective has it
been that charg .s have dropped to
30o cents a hundred for ginning cot
ton and Sz.oo per bale for bagging
an'd ties. Good, good; the farmers
are benefited. More money will
be in circulatio among the people.
The cont;nued rise of cotton has
inspired ilope in the breasts of our
people. Middling at 8Y. notwithi
standing the half crop, places our
farmers in better financial standing
than they have been for several
years. Thus, cuttailing of expen
ses, the close attention to home
products. less attendance to balls,
have shown them how easily money
can be saved. This year 95 has
been a severe and profitable lesson.
Jos. Rougeur was in Abbeville
this week.
Should a stranger visit any sec
tion of the parish and listen to the
harangues blabbered by some of the
''reformers," he would imagine him
self in Siberia, where exist serdom,
slavery and oppression. Can any
of our readers inform us why so
much kicking is being dclone. To
use the "reformers" favorite
expression this parish is in a "ty
rannous and despotical conditiom,"
brought about by the present
officials. Fortunately, the people
at large are enjoying free, healthy
liberty a .d our *"friends" are about
the only ones who would like to
make the world believe that Lafa
yette is in jeopardy, in peril.
Another "mut d'appui" is "Let us
break that chain of oppression de
priving us of the fruit of the land."
H ve our re ders ever heard such
stuff ? and coming from Democrat
too! Why are they anxious to
break that "chain of oppression ?"
T e answer is plain. It is simply
to link it up again for their espec
ial benefit, and make it as formid
able as it was a few years ago.
W..en the old *knot" dictated to,
and bulldozed the citizens of this
parish in a manner that woild make
the present "'tyrants" blush . That
racket will not work a darned bit,
as the bite of a poor little lap dog
is as fatal as the gnaw from a bull
dog infected with hydrophobia.
So this reform *'halla" is froth,
plain and simple.
