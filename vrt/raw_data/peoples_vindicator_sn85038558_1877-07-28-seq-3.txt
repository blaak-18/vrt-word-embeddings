Thel Bart Ablo canptain, the genial
Dick Sinnot, and lher clerk that cour
teous George Hamilton, renitder the
findicator service each week which
is beyond ordinary thanks or recoin
pense. Those files of lante city papers
per steamer are refreshing to one
who delves for late news in a New
Orleans journal ten days old by inmail.
We, in common with many of our
citizens, have been anxionsly looking
for Mr. Ab Jourdan to supply the
market with those luscious grapes
from his vineyard. JHe can sell a
large quantity provided the price is
not too high. At ten cents per pound
almost any reasonable quantity can
be disposed of any day.
Among our most valined exchanges
is the daily Cincinnati Enquirer, a
staunch Western Democratic paper.
Mr. John Rlaggio is now getting up a
clnb for it, and twe hope every person
abnle to take a paper will snbscribe
for the Enuirer. St bscript ion price

Barrison, was bit ten on the hand by
a huge rattlesnakle ahout ten daysi
since. Mr. IHarrison was hauling
rails and the snake was in coil un
der tihe rail pile, lwhen upon removing
them lie fastened his fangs so deeply
that e had to be literally pulled off.
Whisky anrd tobacco were freely
tsed asantidotes, and, strange to say,
Mr. Harrison diid not suffer a day's
iaconvenience. IHis escape was, how
ever, miraculous.
Tar WEATurnrr, &c.-TIre long
spell of hot weather' is over; so our
weather prognosticators say. We
3re now enjoying delightfnl days and
tool nights, which latter betoken
fovrs and sickness generally. Our'
physicians are kept pretty busy now,
but the diseases prevalent are of nmild
typeand very few fatal cases are re
ported. Crops are reported in fiue
*ndition. Our information comes
hole the best and most trustworthy
barces and we have no hositancy in
sying that Natchitoches and adjoin
Cg parishes never had a finer crop
tra the present growing one. The
UI crops are especially good and our
Iraers look forward to a season of
plesty in tire future.
Providence has coitainly blessed
oanisiana. A good government and
£ iee agricultural yield are twin
Irauta of God for which we should be
evostly thankful.
We were much pleased to meet 111
