Compulsory Vaccination
Will no one protest against the
barbaric mandate which is being ex
ecuted in Atlanta? Must a whole
city of 80,000 people suffer all the
ills of inoculation from a deadly and
loathsome animal poison as a pre
sumed prophylactic against small
pox, when in all probability less than
one-fourth of one per cent, of such
population will ever be exposed to'
the contagion? Certainly the en
lightened city of Atlanta must have
any number of thinking men and
women who are not afraid to arise
in defense of common sense and de
cency. It is a reflection upon the
progressive spirit of Atlanta that she
appears so far behind the pace as to
indulge in the practice of this old
fallacy, a curse which has been hand
ed down by the well-meaning but
erratic old investigator, Jenner, who
himself realized before his death the
dangers of the practice he had inau
gurated.
It has been estimated that more
than half of the medical profession
is opposed to vaccination, and this
greater proportion number among
themselves some of the most emi
nent physicians and surgeons in
America and Europe. The late Dr.
J. M. Peebles, of California, who
twice circumviated the globe, was
United States Consul to Trebizone,
Asiatic Turkey, who spent long pe
riods among the smallpox infested
districts of Europe and Asia, and
who was fellow of a number of the
most important medical and scien
tific societies in this country and
England, wrote, among other health
precautions: “Allow no surgeon to
put vaccination virus in your yaur.
The virus is dead, poisonous pus—it
does not prevent smallpox.”
The argument for the practice of
vaccination is based upon statistics
compiled altogether by the faithful,
and promoted by those who reap a
pecuniary harvest from the distribu
tion of the virus. The virus itself is
bred in filth, and propagated through
the same medium. Think of volun
tarily admitting into the circulation
of one’s good blood the essential
poison of a vile animal sore! It is
contrary to every law of Nature, and
repulsive to the human idea of de
cency.
That vaccination does not prevent
smallpox is evidenced by the thou
sands of cases, where persons have
been successfully vaccinated, not on
ly once but a number of times, and
yet have contracted even the conflu
ent form of smallpox just the same.
On the other hand, may be recited
the following incident which may be
properly vouched for: During the
winter of 1904-1905, a smallpox pa
tient, his face covered with the vesi
cating pustules, was allowed to pass
through a warm and unventilated
manufacturing plant and mingle for
some time with the employees, also
to stop and converse with the writer
a.t the office of this plant; and not
one of the employees of the mill,
nor had the writer, ever been vacci
nated. And yet, not a case of small
pox was contracted. It is conclusive
from this that the system of those
thus exposed was at the time in such
a state of equilibrium, that no place
of lodgment was found for the germ.
And only such a constitutional con
dition in those who have been vac
cinated will prevent the lodgment of
the disease, no matter how well
marked from the results of the vac
cine virus.
All who have given the matter any
thought must recall the appointment
by the late Queen Victoria of a com
mittee of the ablest medical and
scientific men in England, including
Lord Herschell, to thoroughly inves
tigate into the subject of vaccination
and determine its value as a prophy
lactic, and the fact that, after sev
eral years of research and the care
ful compiling of statistics both pro
and con by this eminent committee,
COMPULSORY VACCINATION WAS
DISCONTINUED. And in this con
nection, let us get down the Ency
clopedia Britanioa, ninth ed., vol. 24,
page 28, and read what Charles
Gbc Jeffersonian
Creighton, M.A., M.D., Demonstra
tor of Anatomy at Cambridge Uni
versity and Surgeon to St. George’s
and Charing Cross Hospitals, Lon
don, has to say on this subject.
Dr. E. Gleitsmann, of Chicagi,
says: “I believe that vaccination
should be made compulsory among
all the people who manufacture the
stuff, and advocate this poisoning.
The rest of mankind should be ex
cepted.” And Dr. John Storer, of
the same city, declares: “We
should see how long the practice
would be in vogue, were there no
remuneration back of it.”
Germany, the country to which all
votaries of vaccination point with ar
gumentative finality, furnishes some
very contrary statistics. The Ger
man Army is vaccinated to a man,
not only once but repeatedly; and
yet in 1871, when the soldiers re
turned from France, there was an
epidemic of smallpox among them.
Dr. C. M. Morford, of Toledo,
lowa, says of vaccination: “I firm
ly believe it to be a potent cause of
cancer.” And Dr. W. S. Thompson,
of Augusta, Maine, -writes: “I have
lost many a fee by giving voice to
my opinions, when patients have
called to be vaccinated.”
With a large following of the med
ical profession, the practice of vac
cination is nothing more nor less
than a matter of acceptance, and not
the result of individual research and
investigation, nor of experiment, for
numbers of them have had little or
no experience with smallpox. This
refers to city physicians as well as to
those in the country. .
Dr. E. Richards, of Kansas City,
says: “What we need is less vacci
nation, and more sanitation.” And
this is the keynote. Properly con
ducted and rigidly enforced sanitary
and quarantine regulations are all
that will ever check smallpox. Dr.
Edwin R. Heath, also of Kansas City,
declares: “I have had much experi
ence with smallpox, and I have dis
carded vaccination.” And from Dr.
W. R. Sanders, Derry, N. H., we
have: “Any man who will vaccinate
an innocent, healthy child is a men
ace to public safety.”
Statistics tell us that in 1804,
when the practice of vaccination was
receiving its most vigorous impetus,
and during the epidemic of smallpox
in Marseilles, 2,000 who had been
previously vaccinated, had the dise
ease. In America, when compulsory
vaccination has been resorted to, it
has usually occurred at about the end
of the smallpox period (which is the
winter season) and at a time when
the natural course of such an epi
demic is about completed; and vac
cination has been unduly credited
with checking the disease, Numbers
of American cities which once im
posed vaccination have discontinued
it absolutely, as have also many
States which once required it in the
schools.
The recent wholesale act of the
city authorities of Atlanta is unwor
thy a representative municipal body;
and the attempted enforcement of
this unjust law on the part of the
a fine of SSOO upon a weak woman
who declined to be made a victim,
is the arbitrary abuse of a fancied
power. In the first place, the law
is unconstitutional, according to ex
cellent legal opinion, the first prin
cipal for which American liberty
stands having been violated. In the
second place, a human regard, on the
part of municipal heads, for the wel
fare of the governed, should deter
the governing power from inflicting
upon 80,000 people the ills and dan
gers of vaccination, when not more
than a mere handful will ever be in
need of the protection thought to be
vouchsafed. And the physician who
suggested that every infant should
be vaccinated when but a month old,
should take himself seriously to task
for conniving at the violation of the
innocents. What hereditary consti
tutional infirmities could possibly be
discovered in a child of this age?
And unless it could be ascertained
that the constitution was stable and
unmarred, it were a vicious crime to
introduce into the system of such an
infant an aggravating animal poison.
To an onlooker it appears as a n
acknowledgment of indifferent ener
gy on the part of the profession and
the authorities in maintaining prop
er sanitary and quarantine control,
and vaccination is resorted to as a
sort of amulet with which to con
jure the public mind into a sense of
safety, without regard for the possi
ble horrible consequences of such a
make-shift to trusting and too fatal
ly dependent humanity.
This article is not written for the
purpose of engaging controversy or
of creating strife, but in the earnest
hope that men and women will take
up this subject for themselves, and
realize that the balance of creditable
opinion is really opposed to vaccina
tion, the practice of which will some
day be looked back upon with the
same feelings of disgust and horror
with which we now read of the meth
ods in practice by the doctors under
whom the adventurous Gil Blas
served an apprenticeship.
