NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS.
All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to he
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a bid before
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the duty of all men to
support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
PROBIBITION.
As we had expected, the Enter
prise publlishes this week a con
gloreration ot rot from "A Vo
ter," that is supposed to tie up
I ltreditor "hand and foot."
Mr. 8. Tanner of this city offer
ed us the silly thing over a week
ago, asklng us if we would publish
it, but having no space to throw
Wlray, we declined.
We told him at the time that the
.' ateprise would publish it, and
: 'that there was the proper place for
It, and so we ndmi it adorning the
t''.l. mas1 of that delectable paper.

the farmers and broken merchants
of this parish can contentedly
munch away on 4 cent cotton for
another 4 years, andl devise plans
for "reducing the acreage," "cut- j
ting down wages," "turning oft
dhands"-the fatithlful servants of a (
life-time, etc., etc.
Mir. Tanner weathered the hur- 1
ricane of the Anti-lottery campaigni
all right. but is being caught by
the whirlwind of prohibition. They
say, however, that is the "luck of a
lousy calf," "live all the Winter and
die in the Spring."
Resolutions of the Cotton Grow
ors' Convention of Louisiana,
Held at Shreveport 15th
January, 1895,
To the President and Members of 1
the ('otton Growers' Convention of
Louisiana at Shreveport: Gentle
men : Yonr ceommittee on resoln
tions, having in hand the work of t
devising some plan for the better
ment of the cotton planting inter
est, beg leave to report:
That while it is the sense of this
convention that one of the main
causes of the low price of cotton,
wheat, sugar and ether agricultu
ral products is the result of the de
monetization ot silver, and a finan
cial system inadequate to the de
mands of commerce and trade, and i
which we invite the national gov
ernment to remedy; we are also of
the opinion that the production of 1
too much cotton materially affects
our prosperity, We, therefore, af
firm that co-operative methods
among farmers to reduce cotton
acreage and lesson production is a
necessity, and for that reason re
commend the adoption of the reso
lutions which were passed at Jack
son, Miss., on the 9th and 10th of
the present month by the National
Cotton CGrjwers' Protective Asso
ciation, and urge, by every inter
est, our friends to join this assocla
tion and help to carry out its ob
jects which are as follows:
«,e have not space to give the
articles of association, as they are
routine and general in their char
acter, and will, we presume, be
published in pamphlet form, but
we publish the above because of its
decided way of putting the true
cause of low-priced cotton where it
belongs-to scarcity of the circula
ting medium.
This sensible conclusion was
reached not by Populists altogeth
er, but by the following able com
mittee:
State senators D. W. Pipes, of
East Feliciana, and Geo. W. Mont
gomery, of Madison, J. G. Lee, of
Lincoln, W. C. Vance, of Bossier,
J. M. Foster, of Caddo, E. J. Gam
ble, of Natchitocheh, A. V. Rob
erts, of DeSoto. John Randolph, of
Grant, B. F. Smith, of Jackson,
8. Q. Hollingsworth, of Bed River
and H. G. (Men, of Bienville.
It is understood, however, that
the gold-bag papers shall have the
right, not only to leave out the
hanealm part of the above resolu.
tions in publishing, -as the N. O.
Times-Democrat did, but they shall
further be allowed to denounce the
committee as Populist. and ad
vocatei of "dishonest money."

Support Your Paper.
This issue makeA five months
this paper has been running as the
organ of the People's party of
Natchitoches parish, of the 4th '
C(ongrcssional district, and of the
State of Louisiana, and it is alive !
and mlaking a good, rea~dable paper
yet. i
But, friend, did r,u ,on iw that
if it had not been for the sacrifices t
of few big-hearted supporters of t
our cause in this city and one or
two in the parish, it would have
suSlx'ndedl long ago? a
Have you done your d(uty, my a
friend, by the cause you advocate c
Have you taken any stock in the i
paper HIave you even paid your c
own subscripti~n? Many of you
have not, and it is a shame, not on r
the paper, but on you,
We have been faithfully fighting .
your battles here and all over the i
state and 4th district, and have t
succeeded wonderfully well, when s
you consider the time and energy t
we have had to devote to the strug- i
gle for existance. C
Oh, what a brilliant, spicy, f
readable paper we could get up <
for you, if you would only do your I
part, not somelxxly elses', but
simply yoars! e
And what a power this paper
would be in the land and in fight- c
ing your battles, and how much i
stronger and faster woul(l your
cause antd your party grow, if t
you would only do your duty by I
it!
Suppose you try it, and see the
resnlt. Let everybody that owes
this paper a subscription senl it
in now, and see if it does not imn
prove things, then if it doets we'll
tell you what to do next.
onm't wait now, but come right
along.
HIard times are pinching you, we
know that, and we are trying to
help you fight the imps of Satan
who made times hard, but if you i
sit down, with every joint limber, I
and your tongue lolled out like a
sulled calf in a bog, we tell you
plainly that we'll never, nerer,
NEVER be able to pull you out.
Neither will anybody else pull you 1
out, and your children will see ten I
times harder ways than you are i
suffering from.
Oh, its coming, ten times worse
than it is now, and you had better
be up and fighting while you can.
We've fought for you in this pa
per and others for four long years
and a half, and now if you don't do
your duty it's a "gone fawn skin."
Rattle tup, and all's well.
POPULIST RALLY.
Elswhlere in thia paper will be i
seen a full list of the members ot
thle NatchitocLhes parish Central

Business of importance will be

MONTGOMERY, LA.,
January 19th, 1895.
ED. POPULIST :-I want to say
to your readers who toil for the
support of their ftimilies, that un
less we rally at once to the call of
our congressman, Mr. Bailey, we
might as well banish all hope of
ever freeing ourselves from the
financial opproession brought on us
by the old parties.
It is hard to think that we did
our duty as best we could-run
one of our best men for congress,
voted for and elected him, and now
because we have not the money to
fight the contest, we have to sub
mit to being ruled by one who
cares nothing for our interests.
If our law makers had not been
for the last ten years, of such men
as Ogden, we would have had jus
tice all these years, and consequent
ly we would now havc, some money
for any purpose as just and noble
as this one.
But if we do not make the best
effort of our lives iu this fight, the
same conditions that now harass
us, will continue, and my friends
we must not let it pass without a
vigorous protest.
Let us get on a hustle, redouble
our energies and rause every dime
we possibly can, becaause in so do
ing we are working for the uplift
ing of humanity from its present
thralldom. and tor human liberty,
and laying a foundation for the fu
tare hope of our children.
Yours for equity,
BENxETT IT. HMILE.
On the first page of this paper
under headlines, "Legal Tender
Money," will be found a quotation
from Tiffany, the greatest of con
stitutional lawyers.
If our readers will memorize
this defnition of money they will
know more about the true fimanci
al question than three-fourths of
our congresemen ever will know.
Mr. Howell, who is a scholar,
thougha farmer, a politician though
an honest man, a financier though
a comparatively poor man, srnt
this clipping to the Daily Picayune
asking comment thereon. The
Picaymne would not dare refute or
deny it, but tried toexplainitaway
by maying tat though congress
had full power o make any kind
of money a legal tender in this
country, it could not foroe such
money to oirlate in foreign
countries or to be aeepted in pay
ment of foreign obligations.
SWe suppee them, just what we
have always believed, that con
ggres I legislating for our bond
Sholds who live in foreign coun
trie#s rather than forthepeople cf
the UmshetiWs, trying to mask
a money that will be acceptable to
Rothschild, Ikleheimer & Co.
If our statesmen would read a
ten cent primer on finance they
might learn that trying to gold
plate all the money of this country I
for the benctit of foreigners is a i
silly scheme to contract prices and r
get the peoples prolIuco for noth
ing, double rents, incomes and in
terests.
They might learn that if for
eigners really want gold it would
he ten times cheaper for us to buy
the gold from the miners and pay
for it with legal tender paper mon
ey and ship the gold to them for
what we owe themnr, let them have
it all if they want it, we have no
natural demand for it in this coun
try except for its use in the arts
and sciences, all other demand is
artificial and law made, and we
would to God that it was all ox
ported to England and Baron
Rothschild forced to keep it, and
that the first lobbyist he would
send to congress or parliament to
bribe a law through creating a de
mand for it should have a "mill
stone hanged about his neck and
cast into the sea."
There it absolutely nothing else
the matter with our finances, ex
cept the result of the efforts of
congress to legislate in the inter
est of British bondholders.
Our revolutionary ancestors 4
would have hanged this congress
as traitors and shot the British
bondholders on sight.
Attention Populists! 4
God helps those who help them
selves, and Reform movements
grow in proportion to the work
done for them by the Reformers.
You commenced in 1892 this
fight for netter laws, against the
two old parties which had cursed 1
you with vicious legislation.
At that time Democracy in the 1
South, and Republicanism in the I
f North, East and West enjoyed ab- I
solute supremacy.
To question the record or the 1
purposes of either party was Treas- 1
on in one section or the other.
With a boldness which can never
be too much admired you lifted the I
standards of revolt against what 1
you had discovered to be corrupt a
system of government as ever dis- I
graced a civilized people.
You had everything against you, 1
the press, the pulpit, the money
power, the office holders, the prej
udice of a generation and the igno
rance of opponents who gloried in
the amount that they did not know.
So great was your enthusiasm,
so strong your reasons, so just your
course, that your enemies dared
not meet you save with the weapons
of abuse, ridicule and persecution.
So rapid did the people gather
to your standards that the corrupt
leaders of the old parties could on
ly defeat you by intimidation,
bribery and systematic fraud.
In spite of every obstacle, you
have moved steadily forward, win
ning friends day by day.
Thepress is more tolerant to
ward you; the pulpit knows you
better now, and to a very encour
- aging extent sympathies with yourl
attempts to put the religion of Jes
us Christ into the laws of the land.
Events have demonstrated that
you were right.
Those who abused you now curse
their wicked rulers more bitterly
than ever you have done.
On every pageof recent history
stands Droofof your foresight, and
arguments in behalf of your suc
cess.
Your enemies, coming out of a
victorious campaign, are flounder
ing in a hopless bog of fends, fac
tions, imbecilities and nincompoop
imne.
You7 coming out of a loosin
campaign, are united, determined
full of courage and full of purpose.
You have not fused with Bepub
licans nor Democrats. You have
Snot sold your convictions for oftoe.
a You have not earned your own
Scontempt, nor deserved that of oth
Sers, by showing, in your greed for
ofiee, that your plea for juster
laws and honaser rulers was a
' sham-battle cry-a mere mask for
Sthe face of the political hpocrite.
SYou have kept the - of the
road, you have made manly battles
against wrong, you have won the
I respectof your opponents: and you
Snow number more than half the
votes of the State of Georgia.
You can elect a governor any
day that gives you man bhonestcount.
You can elect at least ive con
gressman whenever ballot-box
sstuing lapses into "innocuous de
Ssetude.
You can elect a majority of the
Lorislature, sad the United States
Senatorin 1896 if we but organ
I isme in 1895, and push the work. as
Swe have dom in th. pa.
Let us begin the work of organ
ization, ,ducation, and agitationi
noW.
Let us cover the waste places
with Reform literature.
Let us reap the lIbnefit of the
profound dissatisfactio,, indiffer
cnce, disgust and susplicion which
now prevails aonmg the honest
democrat, of the rank and tile.
The way to begin is to ba!iu.
Therefore as chairman of your
State Executive Conunittee I here
Iy call a meeting of that body at
Atlanta, on January 31st, 1,95, at
10 o'clock a. m., at the office of
Pho People's Party Paper,
Let every member of the com
mittee he present.
Let us put the ball in motion.
T''os. E. W rATSON,
Jan. 1b, s1i95. Chairman.
Populists of Louisiana, read the
the above and apply it to yoursel
ves, and then "get a move on youl."
The first and most important work
is to save your state paper. You
have not (lone your duty by it.
You have not sustained it as you
should and as you can. If you let
it go down, all your labor and your
noble sacrifices will be lost for
years to come and you can't afford
it. A little effort immediately will
do the work. We polled 15,333
votes in the late election by demo
cratic count and out of that many
voters, this paper has only 1,404)
subscribers and half of them un
paid.
This wont do, it will take better
support than that to land your
cause. So many of you have done
nothing at all.
A Sensible Idea.
Mr. H. Manhein, spent a portion
of last week in New Orleans, La.
looking after business interests for
the coming season. While there,
he visited prominent cotton brok.
ers, commission merchants, bank
ers and other business men and he
told us that the sentiment was
entirely in favor of a great reduc
tion in the acreage of cotton this
year. That commission merchants
told him, that they would advance
money to the planters to buy cot
ton now where they would agree to
plant none, as cotton can now be
bought anch cheaper than it can
be raised, and that it the farmers
would buy cotton instead of rais
ing it, the price would go up so
high before fall that they would
make alarge profit, and at the
same time their farms could be
planted in crops that would supply
their farms for the year 1895, so
they would not have to buy any
supplies from the merchants.
On the other hand if they plant
cotton the price will remain low
and they will not have the home
supplies on hand.
We asked Mr. Manheim if lihe
would furnish supplies to his cus
tomers where they did not plant
any cotton, but where they author~
ized him to buy cotton for them.
He sid yes, he had much rather
supply a man money to buy cotton,
and supplies to make a supply
op on, than to furnish a man to
m cotton as he would be much
more certain of gettig his money,
and his austomers would be much
surer of having somethlt le0. af
ter payingfor his yed acout.
We advise al oear tirs ta sme
Mr. Manbeaim about h1u atthr,
for wethink there s soamethig in
it worth looking after. Dmat drop
this thing withoet lookiu late it.
