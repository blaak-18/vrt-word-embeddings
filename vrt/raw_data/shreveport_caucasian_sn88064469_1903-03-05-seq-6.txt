Mr. .Ml-Millan will tak e into Africa
one of the largest expeditions of re--nt
years. Like Stanley, he will carry
steel boats in sections, and when he
reaches the headwaters of the unex
plored Blue Nile he will launch these
boats and descend the river. A hun
dred camels will be required to carry
his equipment, and his caravan will be
a quarte.r of a mile in length.
The expedition was made possible
owing to the fact that the Amer-ican,
who is only thirty years pf age. is a
personal friend of the Abyssinian mon
arch. When Ras Makonnen, the noted
savage warrior, attended King Ed
ward's coronation as the representative
of Menelek, he bore with him an invita
tion to Mr. McMillan to visit Abyssinia
as Menelek's guest, and as an earnest
of good faith decorated the St. Loui
alan with a gold medal that will insure
him protection while he is in the Ethi
opian realm.
When the British government learn
ed that Mr. McMillan had decided not
only to accept Menelek's invitation,
but to utilize the opportunity to ex
plore the country whence came the
queen of Sheba and where King Solo
cmon's mines were located, they imme
diately offered to have a gunboat
awaiting himat the juncture of the
Blue and Whit Niles. Their interest
in the matter was explained by the
fact that should the Blue Nile be found
navigable from its source to the White
Nile boats will be put on it to carry
British goods into Abysslniaawhieh i
a British protectorate. Mr. McMillan,
who is bearing the whole expense of
the espedition, promptly accepted the
F.tish ofer, as the gunpoat wmil be

OLD TIME MIDSHIPMEN.
A Sample Examination Before the
Advent of Our Naval Schools.
The midshipmen, who were designed
to be the future captains, were all of
tender years when appointed, and,
without preparation, were sent on
board ships either fitting out or about
to sail in search of the enemy. Yet the
need of mental education for the youag
sters was great, and fitft.l attmen;ts
were made to provide it. ('oil-,ur"ys

excellent history of the Naval academy
I have followed, the author thus de

Joseph Tatnall:
Commodore-Mr. Tatnall, what would
be your course, supposing you were off
a lee shore, the wind blowing a gale,
both anchors and your rudder gone, all
your canvas carried away, and your
ship scudding rapidly toward the break
ers?
Tatnall-I cannot conceive, sir, that
such a combination of disasters could
possibly befall a ship in one voyage.
Commodore-Tut, tut. young gentle
man! We must have your opinion sup
posing such a case to have actually oc
curred.,
Tatnall - Well, sir, sails all carried
away, do you say, sir?
Commodore-Aye, all-every rag.
Tatnall-Anchor gone, too, sir?
Commodore-Aye, not an uncommon
case.
Tatnall-No rudder either?
Commodore-Aye, rudder unshipped.
(Tatnall drops his head despondingly
in deep thought). Come, sir; come,
bear a hand about it. What would you
do?
Tatnall (at last and desperate)-Well,
I~d let the infernal tub go to the deuce,
where she ought to go!
Commodore (joyously) - ltight, sir;
perfectly right! That will do, fir. The
clerk will note that Mr. Tatnall has
E be7r*e e I3Er.ta to Woo $l3p.
T. P. O'Ceonor writes in M. A. P.
thus: '"It is well tnown -that Lord
Roasbery has been cursed-that I. the
word-by recurreat Insomnia all
through his lite. I know no malady
which is more calculated to sap the en
ergy and destroy the nerve of man
than sleeplessness, and I believe that
much of what ii apparently erratic in
the career of Lord Rosebery is to be
attributed to the want' of sequence
which the depression of sleeplessness,
amounting sometimes ahofst to de
spair, has produced in his mind. Of the
many remedies which have been tried
by Lord Rosebery for this distressing
nalady, the most original is that which,
according to one paper, I find he now
resorts to at Dalmeny. It is'to order a
carriage with four horses to be ready
for him at 10 o'clock at night, long,
after he has had dinner. In this equi
page, preceded by an outrider, Lord
Rosebery rides for hours. It is one of
the many ways in which he hopes to
get sleep."
The Era of the Waterfalls.
One of the most notable things in the
rapid iimarch of mechanical science is
the increasing use of waterfalls for the
production of electric power. This is
going on in all parts of the world and
haps resulted in an enormous increase
in the money value of the falls. Some
one has estimated that Niagara fall;,
as a producer of power, is worth $1,
000,000. Waterfalls are now driving
tramcars, lighting cities, running fac
tories, irrigating farms and performing
innumerable other services, often at a
distance of many miles from the source
of power. Italy, abounding with wa
terfalls on the slopes of the Alps and
the Apennines, is among the leaders in
this advance. In India it is proposed
to derive 50,000 horsepower from the
Doogh Sagar river, at a point- where its
vaters'descend about 2.500 feet.
The /Aldermaa's Advice.
Archdeacon Sinclair told a story at
the lord mayor's banquet in London of
the days when he was a young vicar in
Westminster, and, togeter w.ith a
number of other young 'men, many
of them clergymen, he dined with a
alstinguished alderman. After the la
dies had left the gentlemen to their
cigars, the distinguished alderman fixed
the young men with a stony glare
and expressed a desire to offer them
one word of good advice. An expectant
pause followed, ttle young clergymen
ecg some words of exhortation.
The alderman solemnly proceeded,
"Young men, if ever any of you are
brought up before me, don't pretend to
know me, and then I can let you off."

of his reasoning and the accuracy of
his conclusions. Mr. Shaw then put
on Senator Platt's hat, walked over to
the treasury department and rang up
the senatok' on the telephone. Mr.
Platt admitted that he had a hat not
his own, but repelled any intimatiod
that he had purloined it, intimating
that if there had been any purloining
it might possibly be traced to the treas

"This looks to me like a Wall street

Some time after the election of Rep
reseptative Hopkins to be senator from
Illinois, succeeding the present incum
bent, the members of the Mason family
were assembled one evening, lamenting
their approaching departure from Wash
ington, talking over prospects, what the
senator should do when he goes out of
office and what was likely to become of
all of them.
Young Roderick was noticeably silent
during the discussion in which his fa

"Mamma," said he finally, "has Mr.
Hopkins a boy of about my size?"

several years, and finally submitted
this man's name for an appointment
in connection with the cotton ginning

As is customary in these particular

"I did address the chair," declared
Mr. Beveridge fervently and burning

with other senators. "I addressed the

"I know the senator addressed the
