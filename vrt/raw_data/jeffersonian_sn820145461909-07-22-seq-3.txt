What Our Farmers Are Saying
and Doing
FARMER OR CLERK?
No greater opportunity is offered
anywhere to the young man who is
willing to work than is offered in
Southern agriculture to the man
who will learn how to do ordinary
farm tasks as they should be done.
The boy who trains himself along
these lines has the future in his
hands; and the farm boys of the
South should be turning by the thou
sands to the agricultural high
schools, the winter short courses in
the agricultural colleges, the corn
contests —to everything, in fact,
which will help to make them really
proficient in either the science or the
practice of agriculture. The farm
boy who will train himself can get
good wages or a good salary in work
ing for other men, and can thereby
accumulate enough to buy land him
self and so become a still more defi
nite factor in the agricultural prog
ress of his section.
Let the town clerkships alone,
fanner boys; there are much bigger
opportunities—more money and vast
ly more independence and satisfac
tion—on the farm. Progressive

GASOLINE ENGINE.
What do you know about the prac
tical working of the gasoline engine
for plowing and seeding operations?
Some farmers seem to think it is the
coming plan on large farms. Experi
ments have been tried for completing
the operation of plowing, harrowing
and seeding at one operation by
hitching the different implements be
hind the gasoline engine. We would
like to have photographs and de
scription of such outfits. —Epitomist.
STOPPING WASHES.
A man has accidentally discovered
away to stop washes on farm lands
that will appeal to every farmer, says
the Elba Clipper. The plan is to
stretch hog wire fence across the gul
lies and nail to posts set deep in the
ground. The wire fence catches and
holds all trash, the trash holds the
sand and soil washed down, while it
allows all the water to escape. In
this way the gully is soon filled. The
fence beats the rock dam, as it does
not hold the water on the land, but
does hold all solid matter. Try it;
it’s cheap and good.
HOW FIRE HURTS FIELDS.
The greatest needs of most South
ern soils are humus and nitrogen.
Our climate is very favorable to the
dissipation of the humus supply and
the wasting away of nitrogen from
the soils. Soils that have been de
pleted of humus do not improve
much except by the growth and de
cay of vegetation upon them. Our
“worn-out” lands could be built up
most rapidly and cheaply by keeping
them covered with growing crops—
preferably leguminous crops. When
the vegetation is burned off a piece of
land not only is the humus supply
wasted, but the nitrogen in the mat-
ter burned is driven off into the air.
A ton of crabgrass hay contains $4.40
worth of nitrogen, which would
gradually become available if mixed
with the soil, but which is wasted
when the crop is burned. There was
never any excuse for destroying by
fire on our old fields and pastures the
very materials which they most need;
and by turning under, feeding or
leaving to decay on the land the vege
tation which is now burned off we
could, without any expense at all,
greatly increase the fertility of thou
sands of acres of pasture or aban
doned lands.—Progressive Farmer.
LIVING AT HOME.
The farmers of Alabama are badly
“in the grass.” This condition is also
prevalent throughout the cotton
growing States. It seems that na
ture will take a hand in the size of
the cotton crop, and it may be that
those who sold their cotton for ten
cents a pound will come out losers.
Who can tell? The winner, however,
will be the one who is raising his
home supplies and planting plenty of
corn for his hogs. It seems foolish
to us that a man will take a “chance”
on the price of cotton being good, and
depend on this alone for his living,
when he can assure himself of a good
living by raising it himself and plant
ing less cotton. The argument of
living at home has been hammered
into the farmers so much that it
seems useless to say more; but re
member this, brother, the man with a
full corn crib and smoke-house is al
ways the man who can hold his cot
ton for a good price, or can sell it at
a profit several cents a pound below
what the all cotton man has to get
for his to make a living. See the
point?—Farmer’s Union Guide.
THE HOOFS OF ANIMALS.
The hoofs of animals are constant
ly growing. When they walk around
on the ground the sand, stones and
other hard surfaces wear the hoofs
away enough to keep them in normal
condition, but stabling cattle with
other animals and keeping them for
months on soft straw gives the hoofs
an opportunity to grow because they
get very little wear. It is often nec
essary to give them attention with a
paring outfit along this time of the
year.—Epitomist.
POTATO OR HILL ONION.
This onion is becoming more of a
favorite each year because of its
ability to withstand the severe colds
of the winter and its freedom from
the ravages of the “onion maggot.”
Sets planted in the fall produce mar
ketable bulbs in late June or early
July, just at the time the market is
bare of fresh stock, and therefore
bring a desirable price. The large
bulbs planted in the spring make sets
by the fall, thus making it necessary
for the onion grower to save mature
bulbs for spring planting, in order
to keep up his supply of sets. The
matured bulbfi should he scored in
Jeffersonian
thin layers in a dry, well ventilated
place.—Farmers’ Home Journal.
MORE FARMERS NEEDED.
While the cities of the land are
swarming with the unemployed, many
of whom are despondent, thus daily
becoming more worthless for them
selves and the community, there is a
sad lack of farmers and farm labor
in all parts of the country. Owners
can not procure men to do farm or
field work, and even immigrants from
agricultural districts prefer to stay in
the cities.
The scarcity of agricultural labor,
due to the rush cityward, is the chief
reason that food prices are going up,
and cotton prices will follow' food
prices. Population is outgrowing
production the world round, and un
less the drift of American boys to the
cities can be stayed it will go on un
til a hungry and naked world calls
for a general remedy.
The one true way to keep the boys
on the farm consists in making agri
culture profitable and attractive. The
rural free delivery, the telephone,
and in some states the trolley, are
making rural life less monotonous,
and higher prices for farm products
are making it more profitable. Farm
life is looking up. It is losing its for
mer isolation and low earnings. An
increase in all agricultural districts of
educational facilities will also prove
helpful. All in all, the prosperity of
the farmer is more assured than it
has been at any time since the Civil
War.
Just now the Southern farmers
feel the high prices of food articles,
but no Southern farmer should buy
meats or grain from the Northwest
or from anywhere else. Food sup
plies should be produced at home.
This is what the land and the mois
ture and the sunshine are good for,
and the man who grows cotton to the
neglect of food products should not
grumble over food prices.
The South should grow its own
food supplies, thus turning cotton
into a net cash crop. This of itself
would make the Southern farm
profitable, and when a farm is profit
able it is not difficult to keep some of
the boys at home.—People’s Advo
cate.
BARLEY IN OATS.
It is reported that the mixture
of barley with oats, shipped here
from the West, is blamed by veterina
rians for the large number of valu
able work horses which have died re
cently in this city. Following the
death of many horses in the stables
of express and transfer companies
and department stores, an investiga
tion was made, and it is said that in
testinal trouble, which caused the
large majority of deaths, was due to
the presence of barley in the oats.
The stable superintendents say that
Western shippers adulterate the oats
with barley, because it is cheaper
and heavier, but that the mixture
means death to horses. —New York
