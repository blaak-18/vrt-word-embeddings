This is the only Big 801 l Cotton that has
all the good poins, viz.: Strong, Thrifty Stalk,
Big Bolls, Staying in after Opening, Large
Yield per Acre and Highest Lint Turnout. The
Special Feature of Superiority of this Cotton
over all Others is the Largest Lint turnout
which is from 36 to 44 per cent. This cotton
is recommended by U. S. Agricultural Depart
ment and Sought for by every Cotton State in
the South. I know all about the Georgia cot
ton, for I farmed there for ten years, and I
KNOW that it will pay you to plant this cot
ton. You send for my book, and let me tell
you all about it. My friend, Mr. Watson, is
going to plant some of my cotton. If you will
Mr. Watson’s publications and plant my
cotton, you will have a combination that the
world can not beat
