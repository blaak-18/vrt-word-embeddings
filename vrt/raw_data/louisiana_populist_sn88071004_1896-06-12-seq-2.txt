FRIDAY, June 12, 1896.
America for Americans was once
It battle cry, but now it should ibe
changed to America`,for the clique
of oflice holders who can do more
dirty work than their opponents.
It the honest men in the Demo
cratic party-and we believe there
are many such in it, don't make the
rascals take a hack seat and let us
have an honest government, it is
only a question of a short time be
forethe people will become so ex
asperated that there will be vio
lence and bloodshed all over this
land. Our l.eoplo are born free
ntl, and they will not be the slaves
of any set of ustrpers.
It is hard for' white, free born
and intelligent men, to be forced to
submit under the law executedh
by men who have no more real
right in the sight of God to hold
the positions than a Hottentot or
a Patagonian, but peace, under the
surrounding circumstances is bet
ter than strife, but this condition
of affairs cannot last, and bhe who I
u attempts to force it will find that
tfe American is still on the soil.
There is a point at which for
bearanee ceases to be a virtue, and
that point has been reached in this
State, and especially in this parish.
If ntbody couldhave been dams
d but the guilty men connected
with it, there would, tve been a
day of reckoning before this, but
our people do not want to do any
wrong to the innocent and helpless,
so the gunilty scoundrels go eunwhip
pod of justice, shielded by the gar
cat of weaknests ad innocence
who would ufer in the event that
tise men got their deserts.

For the I... P'olulist :
If the P0opulist h:4l been in doult
about the wislohm of suIl'orting 1
Walter )eneprre for the U'. S. t
senate. all such doubts would now r
he removed by reading last week's
issue of the Elnteriprise, whic:h pic- a
tures in erratic colors the terrible (
overthrow l)enegre's election wouldl
have lien to the 1)enocratic party. g
We knew thik all alone, and
hence worked day and night to ac
conlmplish it, an'l it was not the n
fault of any l')opuhst or Republi- t
can that the desired overthrow was ii
not :icol)lished.
And iight here we will say that I
the cobline of Populists and le- e
public:ns has proven so worthy a n
foe that the ememlnly's steel has gen
erally glitered only from behind a h
Ireastwork, and while the l)emo
cri.ts revile us for voting for )e- s
negre (one of their own lmemlnbrs)
they are coml:elled to respect us ii
more for our firm, united and con- h
servative action than if we had u
yielded our manhood and our par- f,
ty to the "filthy lucre" of the cor- ti
rupt leaders of the present Delo- ii
cratic party. C
The Democrats caucussed on the d
Circuit Judges, mostly through the n
influence of J. C. Pugh, who knew
his name would be "Denis" in a r
fair, open fight. Many Democrats a
were sorely disappointed in the r
result of said caucus, because Pughi f
run It and trade.! off the other five c
Judges to land himself,
The combine though not able to
elect, agreed to stand solid and
vote blank, except for Beauregard
of the 5th Circuit, because he is a
son of the late Gen. P. G. T. Beau
regard, under whose command ma
ny of the Populist and Republi- a
can members had fought during the
war.
A well organized body of men I
acting in the performance of any
kind of duty is beautiful to behold,
and as the combine "tracked the
line" in the six ballots for Judges,
several admiring independents came
over and voted with them.
Forty-four members of the Al
liance in 1892 did not come as near
getting reform as the present thir
ty-one Populist and Repulican a
members, though pledged equally v
to reform. The reason is, that (
the Alliance wanted its reforms in- a
side the Democratic party, and c
said party is plecged against re- a
form; while nowf we have a politi- (
cal party, itself pledged to reform, n
and its members owe no allegiance a
to another, hence are not trying to ii
serve two masters. a
But with the aid of the traitorous ti
Citizens League and the members o
who occupy stolen seats, the Dem
ocratic is largely in the majority, p
and little good can be expected of
this Legislature. The combine a
may, however, be able to keep e
down some pernicious" legislation. ii
It is hardly probably that any c
change in the election law will be
made, and in November every man r
who desires to remain free will have t
to go to his poll to vote with his a
shot gun.
The Populists can stand this
much better than the Democrats, j
as they are only hastening the
death of their own party and the 1
disgrace of themselves.

r- "In the White House there was E
,n a voice heard, lamentation, and s
y weeping, and great mourning; b
it Grover weeping for his third term,
i- and would not he comforted, be
d cause it was not." If any penny

te above statement when his tale of
;o incompetence, dishonesty and arro- ft
gance reaches the fourth month of

es of King-Cleveland. b
]- When Grover heard that the sil- b
y ver men would control the Ken.
tucky Democratic Convention, he *
must have given Carlisle a diess- c
Sing-down, for that turncoat seem- t
p ed to have shrunk about six inches a
. in height, while his face had length- tl
ened about thrce inches. Since
the news came over the wire that a t
J storm of hisses had greeted every a
I reference to the Fat President in y

around the corner whenever he
Ssees a fat man coming along the tl

a, Poor Old Grover I
e Theo prospects of the silver wing
re being in control when the Dem;uo
cratac convention meets, has a ten
dency to restore to healthy action
the disordered liver of the average 1
silver Democrat. In fact, some
of those who a few weeks ago were
as sad as a dog who has lost his I
mh bone, are now in the same happy
s frame of mind as a negro who r
watches a fine watermelon ripen
Sing in his neighborr's den. How
ever, they must re ime that this
P- uprising of the people is mainly
at due to the agitation started by the 1
reformers who esteem principle
i1 above party, and that the honest
voters who made . their ajorities
in the past are in revolt against
the spostate President and Cabinet '
oalers and the cckoosm of the 6di (
Congres, and that they will not be -
Sdeceied arain.
The people, the prodacers, mer

One of the funny antics of the
citizens living in a country called
the United Statrs is, that they will
turn out armed to the teeth and
face death in storming a jail to
lynch some malefactor, or shoot
some bank robber or horse thief,
but will quietly submit to be rob
beand of their politicl rights by a
set of thieving election board
counters, and the thieves thus o!
taining the offices steal more than
all the horses, or all the money m
the banks, and cause more pover
ty and crima and prostitution than
all the malefactors ever hung.
Yes, they are a very queer people
over in the United States. They
kill the little criminals and honor
the big ones. If they would re
verse the order, much good would
result, but they are such queei
people.--Appeal to Reason.
