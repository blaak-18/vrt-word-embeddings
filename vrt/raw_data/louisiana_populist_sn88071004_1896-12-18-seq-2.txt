FRIDAY, December xS, x896.
The returns from South Dakota
elected both of the Populist con
gressmen b small pluralities.
Jehu Baker, Populist, also elected
in Illinois.
The Sionux Falls Press, one of the i
ablest republican journals of Sonth
Dakota, has been taken on a mort
gge of $10 000, owned by Mrs.
BlancheM, MBliss, who has leased
it to a syndicate of Populists, with
Senator Pettiqew at the head and
it will be converted into a daily
populist paper.
Among some fifteen answers to
our call for advice as to convening
the People's party state Central
Committe in the latter part of
January, all except two favor same.
We would like to hear from others,
and each one that favors it will be
expected at the meeting without
fail.

As indicated in the letter of
Hon. Lee MeAlpin last week, some
of oar electors and others thought
the Electoral College for this Btate
would convene in Baton Rouge oa
nrst Wednesday in December, but
the date has been changed to some
time in January.
For more than a week reports
of the death of the great Cuban
leader, Antonio Maceo, have been
, ying thick sad fast with varying
degrees of accuracy. Some that
hae had been killed in battle, others
that he had been assasinated, while
no one believed any of them. But
it is now believed that he has been
killed by some method or other.
Be was perhaps the greatest of
Cuhban leadur in battle, but his
death es to have simply stir
Sred the Cbal s and their friends

I A Car Load of Sugar. St
" foi
The donation from the sugar tit
planters of Ascension, headed by ag
S enator HI. %lcCall, is but the re- th:
flex of the princely hospitality, w,
the open handed generosity of this vo
r. chivalrous and noble race of Lou- St
r. isiana. whose munificent gifts and is
oi pen hearts in a time of need or m1
on peril. are world-falmed. v
s Nothing could be donated the ne
40 Idrouth-stricken of this section that St
will prove more acceptable than cv
this gift of sugar, which is one of ca
" life's most appreciated necessities. vC
The independent people of the hill T'
o parishes of innate pride, even in vc
' their hour of need will not hesi
no tate to express their heartfelt ap- m
a preciation of the willing bands
00 stretched forth thus in a spirit of sh
friendly gift and unsolicited giving St
r from the agriculturistsof southern m
Louisiana. It demonstrates the TI
bonds of amity, the homogeneity fo
of aims, the grand brotherhool of or
rtthe citizens of Louisiana. The
b Times takes pride in this feeble
recognition of the princely gene- e)
by rosity of the sugar planters of As- sa
,id cension towards their unfortunate w
d fellow-citizens of this section of O
the state in their behalf.--Shreve- c
o port Times. ar
The sugar planters of Ascension T
6. were the first people outside the of
* drouth belt to respond to our ap- f
ta peals. Before the drouth had been
n- broken in this section, these good w
x people in mass-meeting passed res- vi
olutions of sympathy and tendered d'
their charity and work for the a
he sufferers. And now comes this
th munificent gift, and ,we also hear tl
rt- that Capt. J. N. Pharr of St. p
d Mary, with his characteristic broad- 0'
th goaged philanthropy, is getting up
nd a similar donation, while the rail- o:
ly roads connecting that section with h
the sufferers have through the in- It
to fluence of these large patrons of
theirs, been induced to bring it free e,
Satof charge. The Times fully ex- it
of presses our sentiments in the above it
e, quotation, which cannot be too of- io
ten repeated.
aThere I emething Rottee a
at These Fgares.
The public will remember that a
of when the press reports of the late 1
me election were stating that McKn- I
ley had swept all the doubtful cen- 3
ht tral western States by big majori- t1
bte ties, that Chairman Butler would A
on not concede McKinley's election l
iut even after other campaign mana- ti
me gers had given up. He stated that 0
he had reiable information show- n
ing that Bryan had made gains in n
States like Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, d
rts Minnesota, California and other I
an States big enough to give him the ti
en electoral votes of these States by 0
good majorities. Even when the a
State chairman in these States con
't ceded that McKinley had carried l
!rs them Chairman Butler said that he "
ile could not understand it and insist- I
ut ed that there was something wrong. v
The official count of the vote in y
tn these States is now coming out and r
er. they throw much light on the mat- g
of ter. The vote tabulated in Ohio, ,
ii Iowa, Minnesota and Indiana show
ir- that there is something not only
wrong but very rotten.
5 Indiana the following are the e
complete figures as taken from the E
ofaicial returns :
his Democratic and Peoples, 385,- 0
3 45; Republican, 323,828: Prohibi- o
. tionist, 8,056; Gold Standard, 3
2,146; National, 2,268; Socialist
Labor, 328. McKinley's plurali- 1
'ty, 18,403; McKinley's majority, c
Ia 9,610. Total vote cast, 637,046.
as In 1892 the same totals showed
Sthe following vote: Democratic,
S96,740o Republican, 25b,615; Pro- a
hibitounst, 18,050; Populist, 22,- e
' 000. Total vote, 558,718. 0
to, This ahows an ineresase of 83,- t]
ce 488 votes since the last Presiden- b
toe tial election. This is an unreason- q
able increase, when we consider
that the last Republiamcardidte
wa Mr. Harrison and that he lives
in Indians. It wasclaimed in 189 a
il, that Harrison brought out a re
ow markMbly full vote. Therefore u
a there was little stay at home vote ii
d to swell this tremeandous increased 7
vo0ts. The inoreased vote would l
a Lndicate that the popolatlon of that v
Statelshediaowrased a half million e
Saceh thelast oltion, and this is a
dh nramsonable. Another thia that 0
a provusthat this iareamed vote is ii
t- et strhthi i that nearly the l
whole of it is couated for MoKin- c
7 lay. Jt thiak of it, Bryanthis
l got o60,000 more votes in In- i
S thB arrHi so got in' 1899. a
ova ma n who could gain 80,000 6
ad the votme that were east for i
~hrir# fiSo Ml , would ceetrully ti
Sgat atiseat halt of the increased d
l vote iit was not bogu. It isd
y eair thaut the gold rin boht4 p I
lbt um a e lta lu s sted the b- b
gg let horwme at this ssloe in 0
seeethremia way rdaoenat- al
N a let ulaeok at Obi. That
State this year gave 475,(0)40 votes (
for Bryan. This is 7 _,00 more N(
than it gave Cleveland four years cv
ago, when the vote was so close pw
that one of the Cleveland electors fr:
was elected, and it is the largest ah
vote over hitherto given by that el
State to any candidate, I)emocrat- be
ic or Republican. It is 170,00H) wi
more than Campbell received last vc
year, atnd 4,0o0( more than Bush- eic
nell, the present Governor of the
State received. The biggest vote ed
I ever received by any Republican ve
candidate up to 1896 was Bushnell's bt
vote in 1895, and that was 427,000. at
This year Bryan beat Bushnell's cu
t vote by 48,000, and yet he is re- in
ported as defeated by, say 50,000 C
majority.
How was it done? The returns
show that the total vote of that
State this year is 259,784 votes
t more than was cast last yer (1895.) di
The contest in that State last year &
for Governor was a very exciting R
one, and the vote was 100,000 lar
` ger than ever cast before in the
B State. The Republicans tried to fi
- explain the great increase then by si
saying that every vote in the State si
' was cast then for the first time. I
I On the other hand the Democrats
charged that votes were imported Cc
and that ballot boxes were stuffed. 91
a They showed that the population tk
e of the State was 3,825,000, and di
that counting one voter for every ,
five of population that the total
" vote could not be over 765,000
I while the returns showed 850,506 f'
votes. Now here comes a Presi- at
d dentital election only one year later
and the total vote is 259,784 larger
e than it was last year.
There is something very rotten
r there. No one can claim that the D
population of Ohio has increased H
over a million in one year, and it 2'
would take such an increase of
P population to explain this increase tl
of vote even if the election was
b honest in 1895. In short compar
ing the population and the total
,f vote in Ohio this year, it would o:
show that nearly one person out al
every three of population (count- at
ing women, children, convicts and
e insane) voted. This is absurd. It
i. Is impossible.
Yes there is something rotten in tI
Ohio, and if it can be investigated it
and the truth arrived at, it would o
show that Bryan carried the State.
"In 1892 Kentucky's total vote F
ºt was 340,848, Cleveland received
e 175,461 and Harrison 135,441. In c
i- 1895 Kentucky's total vote was s
m- 357,057. In 1896 Kentucky's to- a
i- tal vote was 406,000.. Out of these b
d Bryan received about 202,981, Mc
n Kinley about 203,410. In Ken
t- tucky Bryan received at least 2,
it 000 more votes than Cleveland re
r- reived in 1892, and at least 30 000 b
n more votes than the successful can- a
d, didate for governor received in
tr Kentucky in 1895. But Ken
ie tucky's vote increased about 50,
y 000 in one year. Where did they
te all come from I
1- Next let us look at Iowa. In "
d 1892 the combined Cleveland and
me Weaver vote in Iowa was 216,000;
t- Harrison's vote was 219,000; total A
e. vote, 435,000. The total vote this d
a year was 512,000, of which Bryan i
d received 223,000 and McKinley a
t- 289,000. This was a gain in four
), years of 77,000 votes. Of this
Sgain Bryan received 7,000 and Mc- u
inley 70,000.
This was a gain of 770 votes in
me each of the 100 counties of the I
me State. Counting five inhabitants
to each vote, we have an increase
,- of population in Iowa in four years
1- of 2,850 to the county, a total of
1, 385,000 !
t The census of -1890 gives Iowas
i- 1,911,000 population. The State
Y, census, taken last year, gives the 2
3. population as 2,058,000, a gain in
d four years of 147,000.
a, If the vote this year was honest,
- and the census of 1890 and 1895
,- correct, then Iowa has gamed 238,
000 souls during the hard times of S
,- the past year, whereas she gained
i- but 147,000 during the four subee
i- quent years!
ir Could such a thing as this haP a
to pen 9 Itisabsurdand shows that a
s there is something rotten in Iowa b
Salso. I
- Another most remarkable phe
re nomena of the lowa vote is found a
to in the fact that nine-tenths of the
d 70,000 new votes voted for McKin
l leby. This phenomena was also
it witneseed in Minnesota, where
n every one of the 50,000 new voters
isof tht State voted the Republican
at ticket; and again in Indiana, which
is incresed its vote 80,000, McKin
m ley receiving 67,000, of the in
a- CreBe.
Is In an interview the other day
a- Mr. Hanna said: Our first poll
i. aof Iowa showed the Republicans ,
S6000 in the minority." Inour opin- a
oar Io, the population of Iowa began (
Sto increme from the date of the
d discovery of this conditon. If
is during the past year of hard times
p Iowa has haid such a tranacendent
-boom in populatine, gaining 238?
a 000 souls, what possibilities await
- the State if we should ever again
have good times ?
at When the returns from other'i
doubtful Staltes in the West and
Northwest are ready no d(lhbt the
evidince of crookedness will ap
pear. HII: it not been for the
frauds ill the NSates mention(ed
al ove, it is almost certain that the
electoral vote of each would tod iay
Ih in the Bryan column, which
would give Bryan 235 electoral ,
votes or 11 more than enough to
elect.
This matter should not he allow
ed to pass without an official in
veshtation. If it was (lone ,by
buying up election officers, the
amount of the fraud will be diffi
cult to determine, but it should he
investigated by all means--The

MIr. W. E. Shepherd, of the
dry goods house of Davison, Lowe
& Shepherd. Athens, Ga., says of
Royal Germetuer :
"For four long months I was
flat on my back, unable to move a
single limb of my body without as
sistance. Nothing gave me relief.
I had given up all hopes of re
covery until the great remedy was
given me. The first week I began
to improve, and in less than thirty
days was on my feet attending to
my duties. I am now able to work
twelve hours out of every twenty- ,
four, and sell as many dry goods
as any man in Georgia. dl.

1 BURNSIDE, (nee Graham) ; aged
t 27 years, 15 days.
I Deceased was born in Alabama,
the daughter.of Thos. J. and Mol
lie A. Graham now of Newton Co.
1 Mississippi, who represent some
I of the best families of that State
t and Alabama. She was educated
at the I. and C. College of Colum
bus, and other high schools of the
State. Early in life she joined
i the Baptist church and was prom
inent in the Sunday school and
other branches of the church work.
At the age of 21 she married L.
e R. Burnside of Louisiana, and
came with him to this State, where
s she has since lived, and was loved
and respected by all who knew
e her.
She leaves two children aged two
and four years, while one preceded
her to the Angel land. A devoted
0 husband, fond parents and brothers
and sisters mourn her early de
mise, but in the full triumph of a
living faith she departed this life
for a happier one beyond the grave.
