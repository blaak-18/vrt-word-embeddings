Ex-Gob. McDaniel's Letter
Monroe, Ga., March 22, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My dear Sir: 1 have received your
letter of 20th inst. containing a copy
of a letter from Mr. T. J. Pilcher, of
Schley County, and wish to thank
you for calling my attention to state
ments attributed to Rev. C. A. Norton,
a Methodist preacher—imputing to
you misconduct in losing certain valu
able papers, entrusted to you by one
A. J. Roberts —and to myself, miscon
duct as executor upon the estate of
the latter, through which his heirs
‘‘were swindled out of an estate
worth $90,000, $15,000 of which went
to the poor children of Greene county,
and $75,000 to the heirs of a Mrs.
Stark,” etc.
There is not the least foundation
of fact for these allegations. I have
never been either executor or adminis
trator of the A. J. Roberts referred
to, or of any other man or woman
named Roberts, or of any person in
whose estate the heirs of any Mrs.
Stark were interested. Nor have 1
any knowledge, or any reason to be
lieve, that yon ever had any connec
tion with such an estate.
The only matter I was ever con
nected with, in which a Mrs. Stark had
an interest, was the case of Thos. M.
Washington and Napoleon
(Continued from Page Three.)
peace had been made with Great
Britain, but the statutes of several
states contained laws opposed to its
most important provisions, and the
state of New York, by new legisla
tion, openly violated it. About the
same time a threatening insurrection
broke out in Massachusetts. These
things caused Washington to fear that
the country would soon be involved in
a civil war, in which case he felt that
he would be compelled to take one
side or the other. He wrote to the
most distinguished men of his time,
portraying the existing state of af
fairs, and urging the formation of a
liberal and energetic constitution.
Curtis, in his History of the Constitu
tion, says that a call for a conven
tion was issued, and ‘‘all eyes were
turned to him without whose counte
nance and counsel it was felt that
nothing could be accomplished.” He
was unanimously placed at the head of
the Virginia delegation, and without
a dissenting vote was made president
of the Constitutional Convention.
The proceedings of this convention
occupied from four to seven hours per
day for four months. “Washington
felt restrained by his position as Pres
ident from taking part in debates,”
says one of his biographers, “but his
well known opinions influenced the
whole. ”
The result was the formation of a
Constitution, and it’ any man is enti
tled to be described as the Father of
the Constitution, George Washington
is that man. It was his influence, too,
which more powerfully than any oth
er cause contributed to its adoption.
It was felt, also, that the government
could not be inaugurated without him
as President. At the expiration of
his first term he desired to decline a
re-election, but a similar argument as
‘3effe.rsonlan
Stark, Admr. of John Allison, et al
vs. David A. Newsom, Ordinary of
Greene Co., et al, in Greene Superior
Court, March term, 1872, being a suit
in which collateral relatives and lega
tees under the will of Gwyn Allison,
sought to have a legacy of $20,000 to
the Inferior Court of Greene County
in the will set aside as void for un
certainty. I represented Thos. M.
■Stark, Admr. as counsel, and was
associated with Miles W. Lewis and
Joel A. Billups, who respectively
represented other complainants. The
case is reported in 46 Ga. Reports,
page 88. The decision was against
us, giving the legacy to Greene
County, and for reasons which appear
in the report of the case, such as loss
of property as a result of war be
tween the States, etc. Only a very
small amount was left for the other
legatees, but my client received what
was due his intestate, and 1 have no
doubt the other legatees received what
was coming to them. You had no
connection whatever with this case
so far as I ever knew.
Having answered your inquiry, I
again thank you for your courteous
attention and consideration in this
matter, and remain,
Very truly yours.

to his indispensability was urged up
on him by Thomas Jefferson, and this
alone retained him in office.
Throughout his entire life lie rose

private resentments when they inter

In the preparation of this article

the most divergent writers, besides
listening through life to every ad
dress within the possibility of hear

It would be easy to say that Wash
ington was reserved, and easy to af
firm that there was much of the aris
tocrat in him, but from the beginning
of his life until he wrote his will, in
which he freed his slaves, he was
moved by the highest- considerations.
Lincoln is the greatest star in the Na
tion’s firmament. He can not be com
pared to a planet. He was a star,
shining in his original light. But
Washington is a sun. There have
been many planets, but Washington
is a name above all other names of
Presidents and kings in the history
of the world, from the Caesars to the
present hour. —‘Christian Advocate.
