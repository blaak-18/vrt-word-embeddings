A BURGLAR BOLD
He Entered a Home in Daylight
He Escapee on a Plausible
Story
Monday afternoon, at about 2 o'cloct. I
the residence of Mr W E Hamiter, 1124
Donovan street, was burglarized by a
young man of good address. HBls boldLess
gave him assurance of success. He had
reckoned that he would only have to meet
-woman lolks" who would easily be
intimidated, and In their lear he would
secure uch valuables and money as he
could lay hbands on. and then skilp away.
Mrs Hamter had crossed over to her
mother's home, on the opposite aide of the
street, when she was inflormed by a
colored woman that the young man had
boldly entered the house and was looking
around and about the house.
Mrs ubery, armed with a pistol, ac
companioled by her daughter, hurried to the
mouse and met the young man, who plc
tested all iatealios of doing wrong and
pleaded his uaneooence. He sisured the
ladieethat kin name was WH (Xark. that
he was a solleltor of Insurance and that he
had been seat by Mr Hamiter' to deliver a
package.
Tee Idles were naturally misled and
disarmed somewhat of suspicion, but as
Mrs Busboy rarg up Mr Blmiter to Inquire
lato the reliability of the story, the youn
man suddenly disappeared and skipped.
The burglar seaured a gold watch and
ehatn, a gold necklace with diamond set in
locket, two ring., a pistol and about Slb
in money.
He is a "slick one," Lut he should be in
the elutehee eof the law, In jail.

John Cray Foster Assassinated
1 1n the Smith Plantation in
Bossier.
,I A terrible crime was committed
24j his forenoon on the Smith plantation
oin Bossier.
d John Gray Poster, aged about 19
t years, youugest son of Capt. J. M.
e Foster, was the vlctim.
d lis body was riddled with buck
e shot, fired by a urgro from a cabin on
he plantation.
e John Gray Foster was a young
a man of great energy and activity He
d was court ous aitd gentle and was
t held in the highest este4 m. lie had
been on the Foster plantatlion as an
e sesistant to Mr. Vickers, the overseer
and general manager of all the J M
and WillFoster plantations in Bos
sier.
SThe Smith plantation is the cent.al
' plantation of all these plantations,
from which is distributed supplieb
and where the ceuntral store is
i situated.
In the fall of the year about outb
Shundred negroes from Texas were
brought to Bossier, and of this num.
6 ner a number were located on the
amith plantatioo.
These negroes from Texas have
given more or less trouble to the
manager and his assistants. In many
aLstances they have dedtd all discip.
l iue, and have atttmpted to have
their own way. In their insubordi
1nation they have been brotght to
1 reason by the strongest of persuasion.
It is believed thty have been engaged
In a conspiracy and have only awaited
their opportunity. This forenoon,
between 9 and 10 o'clect, Mr Vickers,
the overseer and manager, repri
manded a negro of a gang of fifteen
or sixteen in the field. The negro
aetorted insolently when urged to
work inteligently, and reiplied by
drawing a pistol on Mr Vickers, who
quickly knocked the negro down.
tue negroes of this sang, at work
near by, rallied to their comrade, but
were dispersed by Mr Vickers
Aoout this time John (iray Foster
I appeared on the scene, and when told
wont happened rode to the quarters
ot these neiroee to urge th m so re
sume work, but as he came on, in a
twinkle of an eye, a dumble uarrel
I gun, loaded with buck shot, was tired
front a door of a house in which the
as1551n was concealed.
John (iray Foster was kil(tda: most
instantly. A noble young lile,giving
promise of greet usnfulna., has been
out by the esassin's bullets.
When the news was conveyed to a
few at (ilassell £ Foter's and from
there oenamuuleated to friends and
front there to the public, the excite
sieat became intense.
In les than halt as hour after the
new. had been conveyed aU y and
mere men, armed with guns han
ero·ca to Bossier. A pose of six
tea mIen left Beuton noaded by
dberzt Thompson, but this annromr
wae greatly inoresedc by armed men
ailing am on the way. Ev.ry white
men LI the Ilatei ty for anles around
ae gatherlig to the scene. The me
gros haraig realisen the enormity et
their crime have casttred, but Irom
What goeld be larned the majority

the ied river front sad l he hilli
She whole ountry Is beIng aroueasd
Indeed the assasi ation of John
(ray Foster ia more esrioue ,than the
simple taking ol a life. It would
iadoceaw that a plot had bee planned
an nsaoreetlon programmed, which
wea preoepiaa , perhaps, much
sooner than di J. At say rate,
there will be fs If say of tie negroees
to escape who are or have bee. con
meted with the gang. ,,We sedder
as we think of the reaul.
The mudrde of John (ray Foster
may lead to the secrAl. otgood men,
Msasens loyal and true, but we trast
saneerell that ail these will escape In
jury and omly the gilty will be made
to pay the iuless penalty.

bes killed his mother and ks brother

blm withoat delay. The body was
