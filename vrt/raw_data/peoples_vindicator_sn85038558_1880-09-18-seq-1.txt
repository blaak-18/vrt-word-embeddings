Time to me this truth bath taught,
'Tin truth that's worth revealing;
More oftind from want of thought
Than from any want of feeling.
If adviec e wcould onvey.
There's a time we eoluld envo*;
If we've bnt a word to'slav .
There's a time in wbte s,
Many atbeouuteon flower decays,
Though we tend it e'er so mach,
Something secret on it plasY,
Which no human aid ean touch.
So. in many a loving breast,
Lies some canker grief eoseealed,
That, if touched, is more opprssed,
Left unto itselt--is heal ed
Oft, nnknowingly, the tongue
Touches a cord so aching,
That a word or accent wrong,
Pains the heart almost to braking.
Many a tear of wounded pride,
Many a fault of human blindness,
Has been soothed, or turned aside,
By a quiet voice of kindnes.a
Time to me this truth hath taught.
'Tis a truth that's worth revealing;
More offend from want of thought, t
Than from any want of feeling. i
I would not cause a shade of pain I
To overspread that face so fair ;
Ah t no dear girl, nor would Ideign I
To add a mite unto yor asre.
I would not have thatoly hne t
Of feat urea cloded by a frown,
But duty bidame say to you,
Your back hair's all a.eoming down !

we are anisous for, but It seems to us
that the peoplealong the river hould ,
make some provision to faiellitate Its n

freight at points where another man
would ploce it on the bank, ot the j
