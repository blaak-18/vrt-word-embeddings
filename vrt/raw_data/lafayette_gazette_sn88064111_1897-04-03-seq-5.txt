 1 bill is before the Arkansas leg
e providing that every intem
p;erate physician shall be compelled
to surrender his license to practice
and- that no license shall be issued
'to him in the future. ThE bill
ought to pass, and a similar one
should -be passed by the legislature
of every State in the union.--Mans
1i~eld Journal.
The habit of carrying concealed
deadly weapons has caused the
legislators as much trouble as the
:drinking habit. A law recently
proposed in South Carolina, how
ever, suggests a method of lessen
' ing the harm done by men who per
sist- in being armed at all times.
-The-law alluded to would, for ten
rdqllars, give a license to carry
_ F pistol or other weapon, but it
would -require the name of the per
son taking out such license to be
.pablished several times in a country
paper. By this method the public
would be forewarned.-Mansfield
Journal.
There is no question but the in
fluence of the president and the ar
bitrary tactics of Speaker Reed will
easily force the tariff bill through
the lower House, but it will not
have such plain sailing in the Sen
ate. While there is every assurance
that it will pass the latter body, the
question of when depends upon a
great many things. It will pass
whenever the Democrats, silver Re
publicans and Populists are willing,
and not before. At the present
time their policy is not to delay the
measure beyond a reasonable time.
But whether or not they continue in
this frame of mind depends wholly
upon circustances. If the Republi
can leaders treat them gently, yield
to them as far as they think proper
and do not attempt to take posses
sion of all the committees and all
the patronage of the Senate, the op
position may stand aside and per
mit the bill to pass about July i.--
Daily States.
The anti-department store bill,
which is really a political emergency
bill, the purpose of which is to win
the labor vote of Chicago, passed
the Illinois Senate with only four
votes against it, and will go through
the House quite as easily. The
consensus of opinion, however, is
that the law will not stand the con
stitutional tests of the courts, but
should the law be declared constitu
tional a number of large business
houses will be wrecked in which
many millions of dollars are in
vested.--Daily States.
There is not a leading coon in
this town but what thinks he is
going to land into a soft and lucra
tive position, by the grace of Mc
Kinley within the next month or
two. Some in the custom-house,
others in the postal department.
Many must necessarily be left out
in the cold and these we advise to
at once seek employment in barber
shops or at shoe-blacK stands, for
the day of political influence for
them has passed and as long as an
educational test is required the col
ored leader's occupation will not be
that of a ward rounder or political
roustabout.--Baton Rouge Truth.
The Peoples De mands, a Populist
paper of Grant parish, is now pub
lished at two different towns en
tirely under the control of different
parties and is edited by different
edit6rs. Each of the papers has
the same date, volume and number
and each claims to be the official
journal of the parish. They carry
the same advertisements and we
presume they mail to the same sub
scribers. Each of the editors
claims that the other has no right
to issue his paper. The misunder
standing was caused by Mr. E. A:
Mathis, of Pollok, purchasing the
dutfit of Mr. J. E. Dunn, of Colfax.
MriLr Mathis thinks the outfit - in
clu8ts the paper and Mr. Dunn
claims that it does not. There is
only one of these papers that is
vsubject .to second-class postage
J-ates until one of them turns over
the list of subscribers to the other
and has secured a subscription list
of its own. To be entitled to the
_second-class rates a paper must
-e an actual list of subscribers
who have paid or have promised to
pay the full subscription price of
the paper. It is not likely that all
the subscribers to the Demands will
pay one dollar to each of the
papers. These Populist editors
should not let such a state of affairs
exist in the circles of the *"Reform
Press."-Boyce Enterprise.
The good people of Massachu
setts, it seems, wish to put Nevada
out of the Union because of its leg
islative act permitting prize fights,
and the Boston Advertiser suggests
that it cah be done by a constitu
tional amendment applicable to all
such cases. The Constitution of
of the United States, however, de
clares that no amendment shall ever
be adopted which shall deprive a
State without its consentt of "'equal
suffrage in the Senate." Aside from
this Nevada as a sovereign State
has the right to legalize prize fight
ing if she sees fit to do so and she
cannot be interfered with in the
exercise of this right. One would
imagine from the tone of the Boston
Advertiser that such a thing as a
prize fight had never occurred in
Massachusetts, but the truth is not
a week passes without the people of
Boston being entertained by "'spar
ring bouts" as they are called, be
tween two bruisers who pound away
until one of them is knocked out.
The country also remembers the
time when Boston was proud of the
fact that it was the birthplace of the
mighty John L. Sullivan. There is
still a great deal of puritanical hum
bug in the Old Bay State and every
now and then it crops out.-Daily
States.
SHIERIFF ISAAC BROUS
SARD.
St. Bernard Voice.
One of the most efficient and
clever sheriff' Louisiana has ever
known is Hon. Isaac Broussard, of
Lafayette. The name is a syn
onym of honysty, integrity and
noble citizenship; a gentleman in
the truest sense of the word, no one
lives who could, with any regard
for truth, utter a syllable to his dis
Icredit, while there are hosts of
those who can bear evidence to his
virtues.
Like almost every one who leads
an upright and examplary private
and public life, possessing the most
noble traits of character, Sheriff
Broussard has mortal enemies, who,
actuated by envy, jealousy and
malice, have sought to assail his
unimpeachable reputation by circu
lating all sorts of false and" sca ndu
lous rumors concerning his official
conduct. Pursuing the course that
any gentleman would have adopted
under the circumstances to still the
calumnious tongues, he asked for
an investigation into his official life
by the grand jury of Lafayette,
which was accorded and he was
promptly exhonerated.
The aspersions cast upon Sheriff
Broussard by his enemies will only
tend to make him more popular and
t elevate him to the estimation of his
fellow-citizens-those wh. know his
Strue worth and appreciate his many
good qualities of head and heart.
'l'The Voice was highly pleased to
note his vindication, which we al
ways felt was certain to follow the
examination of the grand jury.
An exchange gives the following
list of nine classes of citizens who
do a town no good: First, those
who go out of town to do their
trading. Second, those who op
pose improvements. Third, those
t who prefer a quiet town to one of
Spush and business. Fourth, those
who imagine they own the town.
SFifth, those who think business can
I be done slyly without advertising.
Sixth, those who deride public
spirited men. Seventh, those who
Soppose every movement that does
not originate with themselves.
Eighth, those who oppose every
spirited enterprise that does not ap
pear to benefit them. Ninth, those
who seek to injure the credit of an
individual.-Creole-American.
