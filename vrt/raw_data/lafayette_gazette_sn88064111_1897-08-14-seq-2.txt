R A. OR- . 1ArRRY ,AD
PROTECTION.
Senator McEnery in his speech
to the Choctaw Democratic Club
attempted to justify his support of
the Dingley bill by asserting that
protection to American industries
was a recognized system of the
Democratic party which had re
ceived the sanction and approba
tion of such eminent Democrats
as Jefferson, Jackson and Calhoun.
Referring to Jackson he . says
he thus gave emphasis to his views
in his second annual message:
,"The power to impose duties on
imports originally belonged to the
several States. The right to adjust
those duties with a view to the en
couragement of domestic branches
of industry is so completely identi
cal with that power that it is diffi
cult to suppose the existence of one
without the other. They have dele
gated their whole authority over im
ports to the general government,
without limitation or restriction
saving the very inconsiderable re
servation relative to their inspec
tion laws. This authority having
thus entirely passed from the States,
the right to exercise it for purposes
of protection does not exist in them
and consequently it it be not pos
sessed by the general government it
must be extinct." % I
From the foregoing it will be 1
readily seen that General Jackson
merely stated that Congress had the
constitutional power to levy duties
on imports, but there is not a word
in the quotation to indicate that he
approved or recommended protec
tion tco American industries as a
proper governmental policy. In
his message to Congress of Dec. 4,
z83s, in reference to this tariff,
Gen. Jackson said:
-'The soundest maxims of
public policy, and the pr;nci
ples upon which our Republican
institutions are founded, rec
ommend a proper adaptation of the <
revenue to the expenditure, and c
they also require that the expendi- i
ture shall be limited to what, by an
economical administration. shall be
consistent with the simplicity of C
the government, and necessary to I
use sufficient public service. In s
affecting this adjustment, it is s
due, in justice to the interests of
the different States, and even to the
preservation of the Union itself, t
that the protection afforded by the d
existing laws, to any branches of v
the National Industry, should not ]
exceed what may be necessary to
counteract the regulations of for-c
eign nations, and to secure a sup- a
ply of those articles of manufac- tl
ture, essential to the national inde- g
pendence and safety in time of war. V
If, upon investigation, it shall be
found, as it is believed it will be,
that the legislative protection y
.granted to any particular interest is re
greater than is indispensably re- b
quisite for these objects, I recom
mend that it be gradually dimin
ished, and that as far as may be c
consistent with these objects, the C
whole scheme of duties be reduced C
to the revenue standard as soon as ti
a just regard to the faith of the a
government, and to the preserva
tion of the large capital invested in h
establishments of domestic industry, w
wdill permit. st
"That manufactures adequate to
the supply of our domestic con- cl
snmption, would, in the abstract,
be beneficial to our country, there s
o reason to doubt; and to ef- P
Stheir establishment, there is p
perhaps, no American citizen who j
would not, for a while, be willing n
to pay a higher price for them.
But, for this purpose, it is presumed
that a tariff of high duties designed w
for perpetual- protection, has en- f
tered into the minds of but, few of m
car statesmen. The most they had
anticipated is a temporary and gen- ri
erally incidental protection - "
It is therefore apparent that Sn
.reference to the tariff, to which
ieu. Jackson refers particularly, he
reommends a gradual reduction of c
-he tariff to the revenue standard, i
*ch is yet the received and ac
Pted doctrine of the Democratic T
#is-2enton's Thirty Years in Con-I
Vol. s, page 345, the author
of 833, called a
was urged on the .plea ti
Iand pa
candidate ft ithe -nl uirat
and C .Clay, the fathes a jd
cafpion. of te high poteetivi
duties, as his opponent. Nop,
every one .knows thath Mr. Benton,
, the distinguished senator from
'Missouri at the time, and who sup
ported Gen. Jackson throughout his
administration, was neither a fool
nor a knave. Not being a fool it is
not to be presumed that. he was ig
norant of the political issues of his
t day and of the public measures in
s troduced and debated in Congress,
' and not being a knave, it is not to
- be expected that he wrote to de
ceive posterity. Hence, we accept
as true, the statement that the elec
tion of Gen. Jackson had the effect
of destroying the protective system.
In connection with the foregoing,
we will also reproduce the follow
ing from Mr. Benton:
Louisville, Ky., July I8, 5832.
""Forty citizens, 'ex-friends of Gen.
Jackson, called a meeting, to ex
press their sentiments on the veto,
declaring they could no longer sup
port him. In consequence, one of
the largest meetings ever held in
Louisville was convened, and con
demned the veto, the anti-tariff and
anti-internal improvement policy
of Gen. Jackson."
It is not to be supposed- that
the people of Kentucky at that
time were ignorant of the po
sition which Gen. Jackson occu
pied in reference to the tariff
and their condemnation of his anti
tariff policy is contemporaneous
testimony to the fact that he op
posed a high tariff.
In regard to the charge against
Mr. Calhoun that he was a protec
tionist, made by Senator McEnery,
it is known that the South Carolina
Statesman was the head and front
of the nullification ordinance
adopted by that State, and as it is
known to every school-boy that the
nullification movement was for the
purpose of resisting the collection
of duties ~ osed by Congress, as
being un 'al between the States
and therefore unconstitutional, it is
evident that Mr. Calhoun who en
dorsed nullification could not be a
protectionist. It is not conceiva
ble that a man who went to the
extent of resisting the collection of
Federal revenues for the reason
stated, could, in any event, favor a
system of heavy duties.. It is
known that after the second elec
tion of Gen. Jackson to the presi
dency, Mr. Calhoun, who had al
ways been a political enemy of
Mr. Clay, the father of the Ameri
can system, joined hands with him,
and by their mutual influence, in
troduced and passed through Con
gress a bill to regulate the tariff,
which provided for a levy of duties
for a period of nine and a half -
years, with a gradual reduction to a a
revenue standard. The purpose of
Mr. Calhoun, in favoring that bill
was to appease the storm of nullifi
cation which he had raised in South
Carolina, and the object of Mr.
Clay was that before the expira
tion of the term provided in the bill, -
a reaction would set in, and the
high protective policy, of which he
was the champion, would be re
stored.
As for Jefferson, his well-known
character and life make it unneces
sary to collate quotations to dis
prove the assertion that he was a
protectionist. His motto, "equal
justice to all, special privileges to
none", repels the idea that he
favdred the protective system,
which gives special privileges to the
few against the interests of the
many..
Senator McEnery has the perfect
right of supporting the protective
system, if he believes in it, but he
shoiuld not use his talents in at
aempting to justify )himself by
claimmg that the sy been
recommended and ennl by the
illustrious Democratic Statesmen
who have invariably opposed it.
The pretensiohs of Senator Mc -
Enery &re not fair to the Democra
tic party, and certainly unjust to
