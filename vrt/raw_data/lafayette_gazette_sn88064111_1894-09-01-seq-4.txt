it seems as if going without would be
better than heating the oven to bake
biscuits, try this way of making a
substitute: "To three cupfuls of sweet
milk add flour enough to make a stiff
batter, first putting a spoonful of bak
ing powder and a little salt into the
flour. Have a spider very hot with
plenty of drippings (or a mixture of

steak on the upper side. season with

ECHOES OF FASHION. a
Facts and Fancies In Dress-Msaking and
Millinery.
A novelty in lace is made with a groud
of three different materials-guipure, t
net and gauze. Another variety is in
two shade of color, cream and butter,
or cream and coffee.
The newest cut in skirts is made in a
style fashionable many years ago. with
the back breadths lined with stiffening s
and gathered in long gathers, so that
they stand out stiffly from the waist.
This is a very difficult design to copy,
and yet very few of these models areto ye
be seen.
The silk ginghams. muslins and all
such soft wash fabrics need a great
deal of ribbon, and it adds immensely to
I to such gowns to have two sets of ht
d color, viz., with a yellow gingham to on
have yellow ribbon for sash and collar,
and bows on the yoke if bows be used, wi
and the same quantity of heliotrope to
be used. when one does not care to be be
all in one color.
Strings are 'often applied to hats, and r
black flowers are much worn. The
waved -brims are. becoming to young
*faces, and Indian corn now figures in an
the midst of many flowers and feathers. th
The sailor hat has 'undergone such a eel
transformation that it is unrecogniza
ble. The brim has been pinched up
wards and trimmed with black violets,
wings and a black bow at the back.
For young girls some coarse straw
hats, trimmed with oats, roses and
green chiffon. A white fancy chip
with a turn-down brim is a novel idea.
It is trimmed with wired lace, with
several roses resting in the hair. A
green bonnet with a pink crown has
t beeig arranged with heliotrope velvet
and wisteria, and a Dutch gold bonnet
with a gathered bow at the back, and
with some green jetted mignonette in
the front, is attractive.
Pointed brims have been introduced
into a good many bonnets, and black
straw, profusely trimmed with jet,
forms the, groundwork to a number of
fashionable flowers, which mingle with
ostrich tips and ospreys. Flower bon
nets are all the rage, and a small toque
looked as if it had been trimmed in the
fields with" daisies. buttercups and
clover. "A t&idesmaid's hat lined with
green velvet, having a high pointed
crown, would be becoming to most
young girls. trimmed as it was with
roses and three large white feathers.

The quickest return is made from the yo
common Virginia creeper and our na

beautiful in its results, is the Japanese
