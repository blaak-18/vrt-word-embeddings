“Is it Mr. Hodge, father?”
“I’m afraid it is,” said he.
She went up-stairs languidly.
Martin Hodge, entering his room
at eleven o’clock that night, found
many notes and cards there, byway
of congratulating him on his nomi
nation, but he forgot to look at them;
there was a nameless bunch of vio
lets there too.
IV.
The weeks going on, and the elec
tion approaching, there joined the
ranks of Martin Hodge and Keating
all that which marked the new in the
first congressional district. The new
is stern, sometimes a trifle coarse;
it is accustomed to make things with
its hands. It is the product of the
spirit of manufacture. Martin Hodge
was unquestionably master of that
party, who, taking a cue from Keat
ing, called themselves “The Chumps.”
Judge Hayden, allied with the
high of yesterday, whose spirit still
informed the high of today, was a
product of that cultured element of
the life which, brought out of the
East, cleared the wilderness and
made the land teem and, resting from
labor in the days before the manu
facturing began, took out the culture
and polished it up again.
The situation burst cn Keating
with a pang. He stared at Hodge,
Hodge for whom he was wearing the
soul out of him, but with whom he
must inevitably rise. The thing was
plain, the result indubitable. If
Hodge won, Hayden must fall. He
wondered what Martin thought,
stalking yonder, his jaws set, his
eyes calm, his mind uncomplicated.
The Chump had not turned pale
when the knowledge came to him.
He had not smiled. He hand not
shrunk or leaped forward. He had
just gone on. He had become some
thing of a speaker and with Keating
stumped the district. His eloquence,
if such it could be called, was a
sort of a staccato of ideas, each pro
pelled at his hearers and brought
down upon them as though it were
some blow.
Late in the summer it began to
be apparent that Hodge could win.
Unless some sudden change in public
opinion should occur the election
would mean the fall of Hayden.
At last, when the lever was beyond
all doubt in Hodge’s grip, there came
a night when Keating received a
shock. He was in Martin’s store,
when The Chump suddenly came in.
There was something in the latter’s
manner which made Keating afraid.
“Where are you going?” asked he,
not knowing why he felt angry.
“To Judge Hayden’s,” said Hodge.
The ground seemed to be wavering
under Keating. It was surely a joke.
He went to the door and saw the back
of Martin yonder where The Chump
strode toward Hayden’s house. Keat
ing went into the store again a little
dizzy. He could not believe! He
sat down as though blind. What was
it he had labored for with that devo
tion? The sun, then, was black—
the air was poison? Martin P.
Hodge, gone now; now, to hold up
before her his power!
Hodge rang the door bell and was
admitted. There were 'some other
callers there, and he waited, sitting
silent till they had gone. Isabel, in
'** s.y, a white rose in her hair, had
' d him with kindliness, but had
1 agitated. Now, as she faced
Ine, she was pale, for with
