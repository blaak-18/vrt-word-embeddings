''Faith, Hope, Love"-chnsritv or lore
is said to be the gleatest of the three,
for the reaslons:
1st, Love 'as in niat in his state of
purity and innocence, bhufore lie hail
violated the laws of his Creal or, at
which time there was no necessity for
either FaithI or Hope, hen-ce Lure is
greatet than ftitIi or hiiipe.

only the mleatis of sal "ation, whihi'
ltove is thet eVtt to which those eauns
bring us.
3rd, F'aith and Hope are graces
pertninitg to this world only, they
reiae with this life. If we follow
God's colnnuavdenwt, we will fitialy

love," 'and he who has thiis principle

partakes greatly of tht character of

Dear, rindicator:
There is nothing in the line of local
items that couidc interest your reiIders.
Vernon news is like h'en's teeth ''sor'ttr
' scarse," and1 your correspondlent has. Mc
Caweher like, been waiting (two weeks)
for somethiig to turn up, but nothiiing
has transpired to raise the spirits, br ex
Scite the risables of a phlegmatic scribler.
I suppose however that for the wanit of a
Imore worthy sublject I can piitch ilnto the
mals;i, postmasters, ani other Iuisanics
that may be thought of This is the'
third time withia six weeks that. 1 have
been deprived of 11' ti papers until sNe
ceeding the one in which they were clue
arrivedtl. I've not heard whether any pe'r
son in "Alexandria faniled to get the Burk
Vill' Era," 11and mlst in consequenlce go
go slow for fear of a cettain--lint
I'll risk tihe stiltei'ent that I senlt to the
Ipost olthtt3 at Leesville to-day, but the P.
rM. being sick, hadl turned the thing vr
to the tender mnercies of a sull , Itio hSein'
"scarce" of meat, had stuck the key in
his pocket and gone out to "sa cli" fior'
venison. or hare, and illy messenger re
turnedtl as he w'ent, a l I mt left to Ichew
the cud of disappointilluent, hitter as it is.
Well ! the way' it rains in thiesit "dligilns"
is a sin to Davv Cirocket, and ha it tel
dency to lengthen the faas Of thiic; far
mners who are not thrlngli gathering
their crops. Cotton is inearly all picked,
but there is a large amoullnt of corn yet in
the tielis, and hiaving been bIlown tldown
by the recent 3"inds, is already badly
damaged, actually sprouting through ithe
shnck. The crop of cotton, here although
a shoirt one, is making an a tiatouishing
turin of lint in proportionl to the amiount
of at'il citto.l it is ill .lial.y i .nstances
mortIe thall tllirding itst'lf. I've heard
from most of tinti custom gins iii t hi is por
tion of thle parish and the report is th le
saint from all.
Th'I'e lealthl of the cou'uh'y is good.
Yours truly, VERNON.
