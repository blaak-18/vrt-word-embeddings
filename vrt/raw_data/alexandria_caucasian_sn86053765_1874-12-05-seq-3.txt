The Virginias Claims.
fFrom the New Orleans Bulletin.]
Tho announcement, a fow «lays »go
that Spain was willing to settle tlio
claim« of tlie United States lor the
seizure of tbe Hleainslij|» Virginias
upon the âoiuc huttta an she admit
ted those of Great Britain, eorrn
lit such an hour us to entirely acquit
the Administration of tho least «le
sire or determination to pro tec
either tho lives of American citi
Kens or their property.
It is humiliating to us as citizens
of this great country whoso wealth
power und institutions have been
no lauded, that we should thus tar
dily follow the steps of England
nnd, as if doubtful of our strength
should softer insult after insult, un
til a more daring nation cowered our
antagonist, and opened tho way for
our negotiations.
The brutal, cold blooded massacre
of ( 'apt Fry and his companions, by
tl»e hotelier Ituriol, on Nov. 7, 1 S7.'t,
a roused the whole nation. From
Maine to the Itio Grande went u|
one mighty voice for redress and
atonement for the insult, and yet
the phlegmalicand In-sotted Admin
istration responded not. The flnsli
od cheeks of veterans, the glitter
in g eyes, indeed^, of every man told
liow keenly this wrong was felt, and
the insult, to the whole people ap
predated, and everywhere was ex
pressed the determination that il
should not go unpunished.
lJiipuiiish<»<l it «lid go, and only
aller a year had passed and ling
land had boldly spoken were we
courageous enough to humbly ask
for reparation. This trilling of the*
authorities at Washington has not
been forgiven, nor will it, bo. Their
failure to assert the rights of Amer
ican citizenship and this country's
dignity and honor has brought out
in bold relief the British colors, ami
to the shame of those in power be
it said, we follow but never lead.
No satisfaction that Spain can
give us now will repair the injury
done. The flauntingdeed has beeil
flung in our face« for a year by the
slayers of our citizens, and now we
have passed beyond redeeming the
nation's honor. And for all this we
have to thank tho President of
"tho best government the sun over
shone upon."
Louisiana and Arkansas — 1 The
President nii.1 his Attorney Gene
ral, it appears, aro apprehensive of
serious troubles again in Louisiana
with tho meeting of tho Legis] a
turc, and particularly from the
threats and ominous proclamations
ami movements of tho White
Leaguers. In Arkansas, too, al
though the trouble with Mr. Smith
appears to be ended, the condition
of things is still far from being sat
isfactory, looking to the establish
nient of law and order. According
ly. it is said tho President, in his
message, will urge the Louisiana
und Arkansas complications upon
tho immediate attention of Con
gress, and such action thereon is,
in the judgment of the two Mouses,
the publie interests require. In
the meantime Gen. Grant will ad
liere, so far as possible, to the poli
v,y ot non-intervention in these lo
cal elifllculties ot Louisiana or Ar
kansas. We aro gratified with
these assurances from Washington,
nnd trust that tho experiment, of
non-intervention in the local affairs
of the Southern States generally
will henceforth be fairly tried, anil
with tbe consent of Congress.— [A\

G
Landaulot Williams and His Second
Sight.
I New York Run.]
The head of tho go-called Department of
Justice is inspired, and beccmie» prophetic.
Iii the gathering shadows of Iii» political
twilight he can exclaim with Campbell'«
»cor:
'"'Fi» tho »iiimet of life gives mo mystical
lore,
And coming event,« east their shadow» be
fore."
His horoscope fur the Democratic party
i» a gloomy one. Elated by an over
whelming success, and lunatic in victory,
it is to rush wildly into extremes of reac
tion, and madly revive old issues which
are beyond the resurrection of pro-Adamite
Hotirlionism.
It. is to be feared that the Attorney Gen
eral lias a glamour of vision both of the
living present nnd the coming future. l''ar
lie it from our intention to traverse hie
right to speak of the past, or prognosticate
what is to come in the progress of his an
cient friends. He has an inherited author
ity to express impressions which natural
sympathy and long association have left,
upon his remembrance. The error he com
mits is this, if lie is not, ahovo all lapses of
judgment in politics as in law, that, the
Democratic party now is what it was when
ho cumbered its organization arid clamored
for its 1 1 re.'id. lie forgets that in the gen
eral purgation which it litis undergone in
his apostacy, and the like of him, newer
life has been rivived. Unhappily for tho
Republicans, the gain of the old parly was
a ruin to them, and the only impending
danger to the purified Democracy is the
return of such recreants as lie, when the
savory viands again smoke on their plat
ter.
lie belonged to the lowest of the low
grade of levellers nnd agrarian» in his ju
venility, standing not on the ground floor,
but, ou the mud sill, and taking its most,
menial service No hungry ad venturer
could taunt a Whig or an Abolitionist
with a great unction of hatred, or malign
a "nigger" with a bitterer intensity of
scorn. My a fortuitous accident elected a
.lodge in a judicial district of Iowa, then
just out of her swaddling clothes of terri
torial wardship, he carried after the ex
piration of his term Iiis limited stock of
law to the wilderness of Oregon, where
ie dispensed such legal lore as luis never
been known out of t he moot court» of law
schools or the jurisdiction of Judge Lynch.
Ill the mean time the war of the rebel
lion brought with it sad portent» for the
fortunes of the party. The Democratic
globe was arid a'Ul the green pasturage
scant and shrunken. After cursing tho
Abolitionists for a year, with a prospect, of
very irregular visitations of the paymus
ter, he became patriotic, and intensely
anxious for the Union and its integrity,
the,colored brethren, and incidentally for
a »eat in the Senate soon to be vacant.
With Mm keen nosti ilsofthesleutli hound,
scenting disaster, bankruptcy, and liquida
tion of the old party, he packed hi» »lender
»took «if principles, and not. embarrassed by
I in ownership of any sin h a sent i mentality
in conscience, moved into the Republican
party and the United Stale» Senate. Mince
lieu lie has become national, and is not
ikely to feo out. of our history in his igno
miny. Unfortunately perhaps, for public,
morals, tlieold penalties for malfeasance in
ofllco are not, now in enforcement,. Ileuip
reatuient is not of our modern school of
practice, unless in the mnnnbin Iiuliciin of
pharmacy, while the tough libre of Mis
souri or Kentucky growth is in a regretted
lisuse.
Iiis next divulgenec to the hapless ro
lortcr is that the third term of (len.
«rant is all "moonshine." Possibly the
asy and facile Attorney-General believe»
his. The man who can give credence to
I k * ferocious fables of the un «lacions I la vs.
must, have an impressible and confiding
faith. That the l'rcsideiit. Inis made no
lisclosnreH of his purpose to liiiu is certain.
His phlegmatic egotism doe» not, open out
ts confidences to such as lie We should
soon expect the muleteer to hold cou
rse or take counsel of tho donkey that,
groans under his panniers.
< >f one t hing we may assure him. Wliat
ver blunders may lie committed by the
(•ming party, they will avoid the pitfalls
nto which lie and his adopted allies ha\ c
I I leu. They will be shy of embaiking in
lie hiisiucHs of manufacturing Slate gov
rnnients in the granite ofliees of Wasli
ngton, established by tho column» of the
Secretary of War, and supported by the
l ilias of the Minister of the Mariné, Se
r Robeson, The judiciary of Judge
Durcll will not ho the order of a new a 7|.
ininistralion, nor will the baton of Mar
tial be borne by the coadjutor Packard
It is quite possible that the incumbent of
the portfolio of Justice will luit be all lit
lirer and publisher of libels upon the cit
i/,ens of Alabama, or «'onservators of l ho
icaeo the »comings of the slums of Now
"ork, or the sweepings ot State peniten
, or infest South Carolina with an
llloial banditti clothed with authority of
law to grind out, tho lingering remainder
f freedom that, military subjugation has
îaroil. Nor will the interpolated prac
tic.es of the present administration be con
tinued The Attorney General will for
bear to take seigniorage of cotton claims
and royalties in land subsidies. Tari Ah
of rates iu appeal cases may not depend
u|miii tho largess of tho party in interest
The prudent thrift of t he Attorney-Gen
eral does not need suggestions for his ad
vantage. He will undoubtedly make the
most of Iuh term, which so far »com» to
have been pecuniarily remunerative. Pub
lic, obloquy has no terrors for him. If mor
al sensibility is a weakness, lie has been
chary ot its exhibiton ^ but it is possible
that, there may be a remorse and death
bed repentance, when he will regret
1 hat lie joiuc<l tho rogues and prospered

A decline of ||c on spots at New
York was offset by an advance of
.'{-10 If cent on foreign Exchange,
but prices were depressed by buy
ers refusing to go on unless at some
concessions, ami factors being un
willing to suffer an inconvenient
accumulation of stock, as well as by
ii large portion of the supply being
under instructions for prompt sales
at the ruling rates.
COTTON—The sales to day, as
far as reported, and not including
any on «Saturday, summed up 5700
bales, but wo know of additional
transactions, tho particulars of
which were withheld which swell
tho amount to hardly less than <»000
bales and perhaps to more. Prices
of the offerings were irregular aiid

although in most cases maintain

Wo reduce our quotations for Low

a considerable part of the sales of
those grades was above their out

give also the figures and full report
of the Exchange as follows:
«SUGAR—Received this morn
ing 1753 hlids. The market opened

most of tho supplies that could be

MOLASSES—-The receipts were
liberal this morning and comprised
5081 bbls. The demand is good
and prices are sustained though the

A Contrast .—President, G h a nt began
his ollicial career by appointing to the
highest ofllces theso who had given him
valuable gifts. Since then he has been
continually a deadhead, taking gifts from
everybody. On railroads and steamboats
lie lias habitually paid no fare; and at ho
tels lie lias frequently got off without pay
ing for Iiis board and lodging At the
same time he has been steadily becoming
rich. A poor man when General of the
Army, he is now wealthy.
What a contrast to the conduct ofORANT
is afforded by that, of tho last Democratic
President, the much-abused Jamkh Bu
chanan ! Ho was scrupulously careful to
lake no gifts. He drew nothing from the
Treasury but his salary. His horses and
carriages were not furnished by private
benefactors, or procured at tho expense of
the Government, but were paid for out of
his own pocket lie would not even ac
cept, a free pass upon a railroad, and if a
hotel keeper had offered to give him grat
uitous en teitainmeut lie would havethught
himself insulted. He went once, and only
once, upon a brief pleasure excursion upon
a public vessel, tho Harriot Lane, when she
was sent out on her trial trip; but the ex
penses of his party were ascertained and
carefully paid for by himself.
What, a difference between such a man
with a gentlemanly sense of pecuniary
honor and delicacy and a conscience in
his oflicialrelations to the Treasury and to
individuals, and a man like Gkant , with
out regard for official decency, avaricious,
selfish, grasping, aud even ignorant of
self-respect in tho most ordinary and smal
lest pecuniary affairs!— [A'. Y. Sun.

WEEKLY AOT DAILY FOB 1875.
TUE APPROACH of the Presidential
Election gives unusual importance to the
events and developments of 1875. We
shall endeavor to describe them fully,
faithfully, and fearlessly.
THE WEEKLY SUN has now attained
a circulation of over sevonty thousand
copies Us readers are found in every
State and Territory, and its quality is weil
known to Jbe public. We shall not only
endeavor to keep it fully up to tho old
standard, hut to improve and add to its
variety and power.
THE WEEKLY HUN will continue to
be a thorough newspaper. All tho news
of the day will ho found in it, condensed
when unimportant, at full length when of
moment, and always, we trnst, treated in
a clear, interesting and instructive manner
It is our aim to make tho WEElfLY
SUN the best family newspaper in the
world. It, will lie full of entertaining and
appropriate reading of every sort, but will
Îirint nothing to offend the most scrupu
mis and delicate taste. It will always
contain the most interesting stories and
romances «if tho day, carefully selected
and legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a prom
inent feature in the WEEKLY SUN, and
its articles will always ho found fresh and
useful to the farmer.
The number of men independent, in pol
itics is increasing, and the WEEKLY SUN
is their paper especially. It belongs to
no party, and obeys no dictation, contend
ing for principle, and for the election of
the best men. It exposes tho corruption
that disgraces the conntry and threatens
the overthrow of republican institutions.
It has no fear of knaves, and socks no fa
vors from their supporters.
Tho markets of every kind and the fash
ions aro regularly reported in its columns.
The price of tho WEEKLY SUN Is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages, and
fifty-si* columns. An this barely pays tho
expenses of paner and printing, we aro
not able to malte any discount or allow
any premium to friends who may make
special efforts to extend its circulation,
linder the new law, which requires pay
ment of postage in advance, one dollar a
year, with twenty cents the cost of pre
paid postage added, is tho rato of subscrip
tion It is not necessary to get np a club
order to have tho WEEKLY SUN at
this rate. Any «me who sends one dollar
and twenty cents will get the paper, post
paid, for a year.
Wo havo no traveling agents.
