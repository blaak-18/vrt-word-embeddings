the Income Tax succeeds, the tariff
will have to come down correspond

ratify the amendment, the stand
patters will have a glorious victory,
and the report goes on to state that
the League is “chuckling over the
adjournment of the Georgia Legisla

It is further shamelessly acknowl
edged that Taft’s “corporation tax”
was put out as an expedient to stave
off an Income Tax measure being
considered by Congress.
So, their literature and their lob
byists will be busy. Senators will be
“approached” and forthwith begin to
have grave doubts on the subject of
an Income Tax, and fears that their
state rights will be lessened, and will
realize that they must “proceed with
caution”. After which, they will
buy a few automobiles for them
selves, and be shining examples of
success for the American youth to ob

tariff troubles focused
our interest upon domestic affairs,
but the splendid dash and daring of
David Lloyd-George, in battling for
each clause of his unprecedented
scheme of taxation has from time to
time attracted the admiring eye of
the world. It seems unfortunate that
he should be opposed by Arthur Bal
four, for the latter is a statesman of
no mean ability, and quite strange
that Premier Asquith should be
quietly on the side of tax reform.
However, the reasons actuating all
these gentlemen now in the public
eye cannot all be known; the results,
however, are the main consideration.
The Lords are scared, indignant and
about to stampede. It is predicted
that the members of the House of
Lords who are habitually absent may
make a sudden stand together, and
overthrow the new budget, a thing
which would be against the unwrit
ten constitution of England, and
would precipitate a political crisis.
This would result in sweeping the
entire kingdom by the radicals, who
at present dominate the sentiment of
Great Britain. If, on the other hand,
the Lords permit the budget to pass
them, thus surrendering themselves
and their class to an unusual taxa
tion, the reactionaries hope to bring
about a no less sweeping change of
sentiment in favor of the aristocrats.
It is a wonderful and an intricate
game, played ■well on both sides.
Lloyd-George has laid his hand un
sparingly upon precedents, tradi
tions, vested rights and ancient
hereditaments and they are squirm-

pany has used the
most lawless methods to break the
strike. It has violated the law fur
ther in attempting to cover up its
iniquities. Its unwilling strike
breakers have been held in absolute
bondage, thrown into a stockade and
kept there at the point of rifles.
Men, whose testimony was damaging
to the Car Company, have been hur
ried, under guard, to waiting freight
trains and spirited away. Bodies,
whose horrid evidence might have
proved MURDER, are said to have
been burned in the furnaces.
Does the United States Government
propose not only to protect the “vest
ed rights” but “the vested wrongs”
of this vile concern? The “third par
ty” ought to be interested, ought to
be aroused to desperate action. The
unspeakable atrocities in the region
of Pittsburg are as bad as anything
in Russia, in Persia, in Turkey, in
Morocco, or Armenia, where brutali
ties have been and are now rampant.
The State of Pennsylvania should
take away the charter of this com
pany and punish to the limit of the
law the men “higher up” who have
connived at every cold-blooded felony
and crime. That the wretched,
wronged employees have been guilty
of violence is true, but their provo
cation is great. The cowardly Hoff
stot has no excuse for his crimes
against humanity and against the
law. Lynching would be far too
good for such a cur who, in the face
of his own robbery and oppression of
his men; his policy of forcing out
American workmen and replacing
them by ignorant foreigners, his war
against women and children “has
nothing to arbitrate”. The law
should have “nothing to arbitrate”
with Mr. Hoffstot.

The most sickening feature of the
whole business is a swash-buckling
constabulary that is eager to beat
anything that comes in its way.
“Clothed with a Tittle brief authori
ty” and filled with rancor against the
foreign element, the pack of deputies
has beaten and bludgeoned regard
less of age, sex or condition. Un
armed, fleeing men have been pur
sued, innocent homes entered with
out shadow of right or necessity, and
a doctor on his rounds caring for the
sick and wounded was assaulted by
this same constabulary. A press, all
too anxious to give the best side to
the Car Company, never fails to term
the unfortunate wives of the strikers
“these Amazons”. Ignorant, hungry,
crazed with anxiety and fear; with

little ones clinging to their skirts,
and others soon to be born into a
world that offers nothing but home
ssness, starving, freezing—it is in
deed strange that they should not sit
quietly down in the midst of their
luxurious surroundings and refrain
from even any remonstrance, or ap
pearance of the slightest interest in
the progress of the strike. Shame
upon a sheriff who will not resign
rather than carry out these evictions
and sully his own American manhood
by participating in such a struggle!
Unaided by the authorities, the
Pressed Steel Car Company could
not run its plant a day, unless it in
aroduced 19th century conditions in
stead of those of the Dark Ages. The
old employees struck for cause. The
strike-breakers are anxious to quit
for the same cause. What are the
principles, therefore, that the Gov
ernment upholds by helping Mr.
Hoffstot? The victimized men who
are brought in to break the strike are
not seeking to work in peace, but
only the boon of getting away from
the infernal place. Why are the au
thorities so anxious to protect Hoff
stot, the chief lawbreaker?

of these organizations
in caring for the sick, burying the
dead, etc., is just more in appearance
than reality, since there is far more
abundant means to take care of sick
and dead negroes than of whites.
The faithful darkey never need fear
he will be left to suffer in sickness or
trouble without prompt and ade
quate aid; nor will he fail of fitting
burial. The secret society that un
der guise of benevolence merely fos
ters in the negroes insolence and
laziness should have short shrift. It
works injury to both races, and
steadily decreases the patience of the
long-suffering white employer and
housewife at the inefficiency, dishon
esty and insubordination of the ne
gro.
At Kansas City the other day a
white lady was violently and rudely
assailed, because she and her hus
band attempted to go about their
business, across the line of march of
a parade of black “Knights of Pyth
ias". A race riot was nearly brought
on. The passage of the wagon of
this couple did not interefere with
the parade, but was offensive to the
sense of dignity on the part of the
pampered Cuffies of that region;
hence, flourished tin swords, and
blows at both the man and the wom
an. No parade of white men would
have attempted to block the streets
of all legitimate business traffic, or
stop the passage of a wagon by force.
Such parades are good-naturedly tol
erated, and citizens are usually will
ing to give them their little show;
but that they have “right of way" is
absurd, white or colored, and for a
bunch of negroes to misconduct them
selves on a public thoroughfare
should have resulted in jailing for

the Standard Oil Company would rob
as ruthlessly as they have robbed

hope that the Government will be

that “inmates were assigned to dis
ciplinary division for trivial offenses
common to boys of their ages; that
those under discipline were deprived
of religious instructions and exercise
in the open air; that the officers
slapped the faces of boys and struck
them with their fists". For twelve
days, the report further stated, in

hands and wrists handcuffed on the

Within a year Georgia has been
torn up by exposures of horrors of its
convict lease system, and of its asy
lum for the insane.
Instances of almost unbelievable
cruelty in institutions are distress
ingly common. Where human beings
are given charge of other human be
ings, without the ties of blood or af
fection to insure kindly care, only
the utmost vigilance prevents utter
vileness being the outcome. And al
ways it is safe to say that petty
slights, small tyrannies, whimsical
mandates and prohibitions are a pret
ty constant feature in most such
places, where positive cruelty does
not exist.
These things are the strongest pos
sible argument for the preservation
of Home. The superficial observation
that in such or such a special condi
tion “the State" could look after the
children, etc., doesn’t take into ac
count the immense difficulty “the
State" has on band now in supervising
the elemosnary institutions it has,
without becoming one vast, misman
aged hive of cruelty and neglect.
