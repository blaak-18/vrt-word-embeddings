T
HERE is no denying,” says
The Independent, “that
Oklahoma’s first experi
ment with the initiative
and referendum has not been entirely
satisfactory. It has one of the lowest
percentages of foreign born citizens,
yet one voter in every nine paid no
attention to any of the ‘State ques
tions.’ This is generally ascribed to
the 30,000 negro voters of the com
monwealth. The negroes, however,
are not all illiterate, nor are they the
only ones who failed to vote upon
the various referenda. The fault lies
partially with the ballot. One can
vote a straight party ticket by mere
ly putting his X in the circle under
the ‘rooster’ or the ‘eagle.’ There is
no way to vote upon referendum
propositions in such wholesale fash
ion.”
‘‘The apparent unconcern with
which the people of the State of
Georgia have regarded every consti
tutional amendement submitted to
them for ratification at the ballot
box, is one of the most unhealthy
signs of the times. During the past
10 or 15 years a dozen or more of
these amendments have been sub
mitted to the people, and we fail to
recall a single one that failed of pas
sage.
The amendments were not passed
because the voters favored them.
They were carried because the peo
ple either didn’t know or didn’t care
anything about the proposed change
in the fundamental law, and because
only the affirmative side was printed
on the lengthy ballot, under the cap
tion ‘‘Official Democratic Ticket.” * *
Some (amendments) are wise, or
unwise, according to the view-point
of the individual citizen; but none of
them really represent the intelligent,
thoughtful desire of a majority of
the voters participating in the elec
tions at which they were adopted.”—
Elberton (Ga.) Star.
In Georgia, it can not be offered
as frail excuse that the negroes had
anything to do with voting the ‘‘Offi
cial Democratic Ticket.”
Indifference to fundamentals; ig
norance so dire that it votes accord
ing to a kindergarten picture, with
out reading; partisan dependence up
on a party name alone —it isn’t pleas
ant to contemplate such things and
to know that each State could prob
ably show a parallel, if given the
same test.
And yet the two main arguments
against granting the vote to women
consist in the allegation that they
are ’‘too ignorant,” or that “they
really are not interested and wouldn’t
vote if they had the privilege.” Love
ly example of consistency. Why not
take from men the ballot they so
abuse? Wouldn’t it be entirely logi
cal and just to do so if measured
alone by the frequency and the intel
ligence of tneir use of it? Take the
implication that the average level of
education is lowered by an influx of
illiterate foreigners, or by the pres
ence of a native, generally ignorant
race, there would be precious few
sections where manhood suffrage
would be justifiable; and, if it were,
the level would have been raised just
as much by the presence of educated
women and girls as by that of the
men and boys.
So much apropos of the widely
quoted remarks of Buchtel, former
Governor of that State, that “only
the dregs of womankind vote in Colo
rado. The mothers have to be prac
tically clubbed to the polls.”
Do the “dregs of mankind” consti
tute the principal voters? Or is it
our best men who contribute the con
ditions of ignorance and indifference
complained of?
Os all States in the bright galaxy,
perhaps Oklahoma is the one which
logically should have displayed the
keenest interest in drawing out the
full voting strength. Its citizens had
for 17 years begged for Statehood; it
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
had a brand-new Constitution to try
on; statesmen alert; national issues
to quicken the pulse of political en
thusiasm—one would have supposed
the men of that State would have
been so eager to vote that they would
have fairly swarmed to the polls at
every opportunity to vote for any one
from President down to dog-catcher.
But they didn’t. Who can reason
ably doubt that in the older States,
where voting has ceased to be a nov
elty, a worse state of lethargy ex
ists?
With reference to female legisla
tors the ex-Governor says: “There
have been few who did not demand
the most absurd and unreasonable
laws. The only trouble about women
legislators is that they will not listen
to argument—no woman will. Logic
does not appeal to them.”
If the Rev. Dr. Buchtel has a sense
of humor, this clipping in passing
might strike him as funny, applied to
some of our male legislators:
The Pale Gray Pennant.
The Georgia Legislature has ad
journed. The JHon. Tad Grubbs of
Bugville, the Hon. Noyes E. Yell of
Buncombetown, the Hon. Sardanapa
lus Q. Mudd of Hogwallow, the Hon.
Greene Peay of Squashtown-on-the-
Pike, and near-coming statesmen,
have gone home to receive the honors
of a triumph.
It is perhaps too early to pass dis
passionate judgment on the labors of
the late Legislature. The darnphool
pennant still waves over the Capital
of Georgia, however; for while the
Alabama Legislature has made a no
ble record, it has not shown the
asinine versatility that has character
ized the Legislature of Georgia.
One of the most illustrious of Geor
gia’s lowbrows framed up a bill that
would prohibit a woman from riding
straddle. Another wanted to require
hotel keepers to provide mosquito
bars and nine-foot sheets for all beds.
Another wanted to make baseball on
school grounds a misdemeanor. An
other wanted to make it a penal of
fense to sell goods of any kind to
minors. Another wanted to prevent
the moving of freight trains on Sun
day. And so on.
This was all right as far as it went
but it didn’t go far enough. Suffer
ing husbands have for years been
complaining of the shirt waist that
buttons up in the back. In many
places the barkeepers do not give
credit. The shirt-tail is too long.
Every ear of corn contains, it is said,
more than one per cent, of alcohol.
Tea and coffee contain a stimulant
that is: injurious . Smoking is an im
moral habit. Riding to church on
Sunday is a violation of the spirit of
the Ten Commandments. Bachelors
are untaxed and old maids are allow
ed to go unpunished.
Why was not some attempt at least
made to remedy these evils?
Os course it is easy to criticise the
faults of distant law-makers. We sug
gest these things, not because we
would depreciate the earnest labors
of the Georgia solons, but merely to
show what might have been.
Justice compels us to admit that
the Georgia Legislature, however,
has distanced all rivals. Many of the
reform bills were defeated, it is true,
but there are always traitors and
knockers in the ranks. When all is
said, it will have to be acknowledged
that Georgia has richly deserved the
bale of hay offered by the Depart
ment of Agriculture for the best all
round aggregation of legislative
freaks in the country.—Commercial-
Appeal, Aug. 13, ’O9.
And it is pathetically true that
while our Legislature frivoled its
time away on numberless paltry lit
tle measures, it accomplished little or
nothing in the way of wise laws; and
failed to ratify the income tax
amendment, to which it was bound
’ by all historic consecration, pledge
and tradition to do. Perhaps they
Jeffersonian
listened to “argument” of the jin
gling sort; and perhaps they were
simply too bent upon their own
childish affairs to recognize a meas
ure of real statesmanship when it
was brought before them.
But, —there is hardly one Legisla
ture that has met in years which
hasn’t developed the same sort of
freak legislation. It is the one thing
we seem certain to have with us,
while the country cries out for a
sweeping away of the mess of trifling,
hindering, hectoring, little statutes
and for a rejuvenation,—of broad,
big, enlightened policies. The statute
books are crammed each year with
an undigested mass of crude man
dates, of multiplied instances of petty
paternalism which bewilder and wor
ry bench, bar and public, until they
are thrown into the trash heap and a
new litter of transitory legislation
evolved. Our officials are so busy ar
resting small boys for playing mar
bles for keeps, they can’t possibly at
tend to the gamblers in the neces
saries of life.
And yet—these various State legis
latures are composed of “Representa
tives.” They have been sent to their
respective capitals with the approval
of the voters of their own communi
ties; the majority says, in effect, these
are our chosen servants to do the
work we believe most necessary for
the welfare of our district. And the
men do all the voting. The women,
for all the stricture that they are il
logical and dangerously apt to give
precedence to trivial considerations,
haven’t had a thing to do with select
ing these representatives. Perhaps
they wouldn’t have done any better,
but it is difficult to believe, without
the evidence, that they could have
done much worse.
Nationally, who runs may read that
story. The representatives of the
people there have so lately covered
themselves with glory comment is su
perfluous. It is a calamity for the
common people of this country that
there wasn’t a sprinkling of the “il
logical” sex. Would they have “sat
down” upon Mr. Cannon in that first
fight for the rules? I guess yes’
When they said to Uncle Joe: “And
who are you?” the pitiable old cor
ruptionist would not have had such
an easy walk-over that he did with

the greedy little rascals who “trem
bled at his power.”
These Congressmen could be ar
gued with; on the one hand, patriot
ism, the claim of patient humanity to
have its wrongs righted without
bloodshed, self-respect; on the other,
Joe Cannon’s patronage, and per
sonal patronage won! It is the
highest type of being which is so in
stinctively assured of what is pure
and true and right that it doesn’t
even pause to argue. When a judge
throws out technicalities due to hu
man errors, for the sake of the equity
made plain by his better nature, we
call him righteous; when a woman
proceeds along the sure, but unmark
ed, path to principle, we call it “in
tuition.” What difference is there
between the two? It is in both the
outward expression of the fine-grain,
the strong fibre.
“Votes for women” -wouldn’t usher
in a Millenium, nor would exclu
sively woman-made laws necessarily
be better for all humanity than ex
clusively man-made laws. But all
the dire things prophesied to come to
pass when universal suffrage is grant
ed remain quite theoretical—and, as
usual, the more based upon sheer
prejudice, the more vociferously they
are proclaimed; while the flaws of ex
clusively man-made laws are the in
controvertible facts of the past and
present.
Mr. Buchtel, for all his remarks,
is not opposed to woman suffrage, for
he appears quite clearly to compre
hend that the possession of the right
to vote is valuable, quite apart from
its perpetual exercise. His wife and
daughter “shun politics,” which is
their privilege, but by the time the
family, which, be it noted, was remov
ing from Colorado before he ventured
the assertion that “ONLY the dregs
of womankind vote there,” lives
were women haven’t the reserve
power the vote confers,and sees what
a knock-out the boasted “influence”
of good women gets in civic affairs
when it combats the will of the
“dregs of mankind” who control the
particular precinct in which he may
reside, they may understand that not
only the right to vote, but its dutiful
and God-fearing exercise is a thing
that even the mothers had best not
disdain.

challis, albatross and percale are all
suitable for reproduction. For 36-
inch bust measure 9 yards of 36-inch
material will be required. Sizes: 32
to 42 inches, bust measure.
A pattern of this illustration will
