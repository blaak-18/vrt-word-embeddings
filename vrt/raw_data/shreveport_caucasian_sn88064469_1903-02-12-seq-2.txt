FRU BJORNSON.
The Beautiful, Gifted Wife of Nor
way's Most Distinguished Author.
The greatest man Norway has pie
duced since old viking days is perhaps
Bjornstjerne Bjornson. He is so great
that in spite of his name we in Aner
lea are familiar with his fame. A
hundred times more people know of
his writings than know how to pro
nounce his distinguished name. He is
the most versatile literary man of his
time in any language.
Well, it is gradually coming to be
known that he does it through the
aid of a wife as capable in her way as
1 he is in his. Fru Karoline Reimers
Bjornson is her husband's secretary
and counselor. in both die mechanical
and intellectual departments of his
tasks she is at his side, sweet, wise and
strong. If there ever was the perfect
woman, nobly planned, it is Fru Rjorn
son.
A photograph of the husband and
wife made about the time of the cele
bration of Bjornson's seventieth birth
day gives the impression that they
must be the handsomest elderly mar
l ried couple in all Europe. *t shows
that men and women who live the
I right lives, serene. loving, kindly and
I strong, need not fall to pieces even as
they approach seventy. Fru Bjornson
has rather large features, as befits a
large woman mentally and physically.
but they are classic and beautiful. Her
hair, now snow white, is abundant and
fluffy, softening a royal forehead. It
Is doubtful if the famous author and
his wife were so handsome in their
youth. They look like a married pair
whom the gods love so well that time
is not permitted to touch them except
to beautify.
Notable in Bjornson's writings is the
wholesome, happyfy'ing tone. They are
not painful, morbid pictures of miser
able men and women, like so many of
I Ibsen's and Tolstoi's. It is a good
world, preaches Bjornson, a bright, lo
ing world, if we only take it in the
right way, which is the way he him
self takes it. The women of Scandina
via adore Bjornson. He holds them up
to be honored and respected. He paints
men such as women love and women
such as'men love in a wholesome, nat
ural way. At the author's seventieth
birthday celebration women vied with
men doing him honor. It was because
he had honored them so in his books.
Every man judges the whole fem
inine sex by his owi wife and mother.
It Is easy to divine whence Bjornson
obtained his exalted ideas of women
and his tenderness toward them. He
sees the whole sex in beautiful, noble
Karoline Reimers. What she has been
to him he naturally thinks other wives
must be to other husbands. If Ibsen
had been so fortunate in marriage as
his literary compatriot, his stories and
dramas must have taken a different
tone.
Fru Bjornson is manifest especially
in the couple's country home at An
lestad. She was married in 1858 to
Bjornson, but not until recent years
has the Anlestad home been completed.
Like the married life of the pair who
FRU BJOBNSTJERNBE BJORNSON AND HER
HOME.
live there, it is as nearly perfect as
anything can be in this existence. The
farm is a large one and one of the best
cultivated in Norway. The house is
very large and luxuriously furnished
and full of admirable art pieces. There
is a group of buildings occupied by the
farm workers. The landscape is mag
nificent. Standing on the veranda of
Anlestad one gets a glimpse of moun
tain, valley, sky and water. Through
the valley below where the house is
built flows the river Gansu. The view
shows nature in her most picturesque
dress-nature mingling at the same
time with man's conquest over nature.
Through the lands of the Bjornsons
runs a tumbling brook. supplying a wa
ter power. Flie water power is cap
tured and turned into electricity to
illuminate not only the home, but also
the stables and outbuildings.
Fru Bjornson is always close to her
husband. which Is wise in her or in any
wife so long as he does not bore the
husband. In beautiful Anlestad the
housekeeping, whether for two or for
twenty-the Bjornsons are noted for
their hospitality-is perfectly ordered
and moves without a jar. The pair al
ways spend the summers there. In the
winter Bjornson travels in some Euro
pean country--Italy, France. Germane
or England-or settles down in some'
artistic and literary capital. Ifare
! again the beautiful, gentle, wise w f,"
is always with him. They have sever
al children now grown. One daughter.
Bergliot, is married to the only son of
Ibsen, Dr. Sigurd Ibsen, Norwegian
minister of state at Stockholm.
In times like these a married life

All the political and other Yroutbles
have their origin in ignorance. of

In a word, the explanation is voodoo

as good as yours or mine, is the only
white person I ever knew who attend
ed a Dominican vooofoo rite and lived.
If his presence had become known, his
life would have gone out in half a min
ute.
A murder had been committed among
the negroes in the locality where he
was visiting a French friend of great
influence. The murderer disappeared.
Thernegroes decided to hold a voodoo
i.!cuntation and make him come back.
The French traveler heard of it. He is
of very (lark complexion and, a little
,:lackened up. could easily pass for a
'negro. His friend helped hint to dis
guise himself in a garment similar to
those worn by the voodooists. This
garment was a white cotton robe. At
9 o'clock at night the negroc s assem
bled oil the bank of a creek. They had
with them it fife and drum, and the fife
shrieked and .the drunm pounded out
horrible noises on the night air. The C
weird black faces and white robes

anise of the fife acid drum. trade a

At lIst they really were pose I aed,
obsessed, rather, by smune str:rnre in

were something incredible. Ether the
Frenchman sa w or else h+' was hyp
notized into believing he saw the high
priest spring straight pp out of that
water twenty feet in the air. The
hypnotic theory seem;u hrdly possible
since be was not a voodoo devotee and
the priests did not know of his pres
ence. At length priests and privates
went off into contortions more extraor
dinary and frightful than anything a
professional could achieve. Suddenly a
live goat was brought on the scene. At
the moment the high priest's unuat
ural energy was lashed to its highest
he leaped from the water and whirled
a naked sword around and around his
head. When it had got sufficient inpe
tus at one blow he struck off with it
the goat's head. The voodooists gath
ered close and drank its4: arm blood.
At this moment the Frenchman. with
the lively sensibilities of his race. had
the greatest difficulty to keep from4
falling fainting off hIls horse. The
priest next directed his foluowvrs *ach
