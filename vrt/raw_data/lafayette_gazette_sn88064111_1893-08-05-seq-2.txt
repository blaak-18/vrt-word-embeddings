The CGazettce has many times
aollu attention to the certain profit
that would accrue to capital in the
operation of a refinery near this
tae.o . We showed that it would not
ifE mosey in circulation, in town,
instead of a good part of it being
engulfed in the capacious maws of
the-city commission merchant. The
amount included in freight, commis
sria, brokerage, and other charges
taken out of the produce shipped to
the city, which in the aggregate
amounts to a considerable sum,
would be kept at home, and all
would participate in the benefits that
a. karger- volume of money would
bring.
That The Gazette had grasped
the situation in its expressed views
that a refinery would pay a hand
some return on the amount invested
isevidenced by the fact that Messrs.
7.. Lombard, C. A. Mouton, Jy. B.
.Dupuis, S. Soigne, A. Cayard. T.
S.- Singleton, and Mesdames J. J. a
Revillon, and S. R. Wallis, have I
contracted to deliver and sell their <
cane, representing some 5,ooo tons, i
(and all cultivated in the Creighton
switch neighborhood) to a refinery 1
in Cypremort for $4.25 cents a ton s
at the switch, or $4.75 a ton deliv- c
eredat the refinery. The highest s
price paid last season was $3.75 a t
ton. At $4.75 a ton there is big
money to be made in the cultivation I
of the sugar cane, and if the Cypre- v
mort refinery can pay that price, t
one right at our doors could pay as I
much if not more. These figurcs a
appeal to our people to take steps c
tot invite capital to come and hells
es build a refinery, and take part in 1h
the profits that will surely result. c
For a purpose of this kind the e
people of Lafayette can and should 0
put up at least $20o,ooo which need y
not-necessarily be given as a bonus, t
but can- be invested- in stock, and tl
get the remaining amount necessary ti
to build the refinery. te
There is plenty of money in the a
country, but with the known timi
dity of holders to invest without
gilt-edge assurances of safety, it will p
not come, but an offer to subscribe f.
in stock. the amount we have men- r
tioned, would tend to allay any p
fears capital could have, and thus ti
assure the active cooperation of the tl
people.
It is in the power of the people to li
have a refinery here if they really
want it. But it is not going to come
uninvited and unaided.
FAIR ELEFCTIO caS. th
Several of our State exchianges
haver of late, touchedt upon ther
question of elections, and have ald
vanced the request that the commit- rI
tee appointed recently and soon to
convene to revise the constitution,
take up the subject, alleging that
in the past twenty-five years there I
has not once been a fair election in ar
the State. tli
With this sweeping declaration "
The Gasette does not agree, but is Pt
freeto confess its belief that there b
"as been some illegal votinrg in a
~fw parishes. For such cases the L
laws on our statute books sufficient- ili
ly provides to prevent their recur- C
rence. If a man presents himself
at the ballot box and deposits his
vote, of which some person. D
knows that he has no right, under vI
the law, to do, and would report L
the fact-as his duty of citizenship L
demands-to the law officers, who, N
flF'thiey are officers that respect their m
-oaths, will see that the ille- fe
-:gal voter is brought up be- Oi
ethe legal tribunals, and it
rsfther incumbent that the know- '
held be given before a jury.

N that the waiting rooms in the new"
depot-one for the white, and the

thrown open at the earliest possible
time, because as it is now it is a
source of great aggravation to the
white people.
Id Last Monday a party of colored
people, male and female, invaded.
ss the waiting room, and a number of
b them made themselves so decidedly

zs most vile smelling tobacco, that
three white ladies and children were

:o MOVING UPW IARD.
te
The visitor to. our sister town of
11 Breaux Bridge cannot fail to notice
the spirit of enterprise that pervades
d the community. The very air is
filled with an earnestness that pri
d ises much for the future. A single
rs instance will suffice to establish
1- this conclusive fact.
d Mr. Knapp offered to extend his
narrow guage to the town if thepeo- 1
t. pie would guarantee to furnish for
his refinery the product of zoo acres
F. of cane, and should they be able
e to guarantee to plant fourteen hun
r dred acres,. he would put up a re
finery in or near the town.
a A gentleman started out with a
y list Monday evening and by Tuesday
a (the next day) morning he had se
- cured signed pledges,.by twenty-one f
t small land owners adjoining the
a town, for over 350 acres, and this c
> without leaving the town. Not one t
i person who was approached but
- what felt it his duty towards the up
building of the town, as well as to
his personal interest, to promise a
and mean to change from cotton to
cane. c
The gentlemen who are at the 2
head of the movement not only feel
confident that they will secure
enough pledges to plant the number
of acres asked, but say in a few p
1 years enough will be planted to tax tl
the utmost capacity of a mill of
the larggst size. t1
With the esprit de corps now con- r
trolling their actions they are bound a
to realize their most cherished a
wishes, for the goal is in sight. b
Should be Removed. t<
A vice that is flaunted with im- tl
punity and coarse boldness in the O
face of a community must be curbed
and restricted to limits whereby its o
presence cannot contaminate either o
the sight, or permit the birth of w
thoughts that can have but ill results. P
While some vices are passed upon
lightly, because it is thought to be a p
necessary one, in no wise gives that a
vice the power to render itself offen- si
sive-when it reaches that stage it a
must be suppressed. We have in o
view a vice that has found a lodge- p
ment in a variegated house, within a r
B3robdinag enclosure. It should be
removed to more isolated quarters.
A Pleasant Evening. o
Last Saturday a very pleasant a
"soirie causante" took place at the C
residence of Mrs. Edmniond Landry.
The hours passed but too swiftly by, I
and it was with general regret that i
the young people bid each other d
"au revoir." The ladies of the
party were the Miisses Laure Guil
beau of Carencro; Paline Baquet, s
Idea, Elodie and Adriene Landry,
of New Iberia; Irma and Angele
Landry, of Cote Gelee; Emelia and th
MIarie Breaux, Cleophine and Irma
Couvillon, Pauline and Edmonia of
Landry; and Messrs. Andre Billaud ge
of Broussardville; Ulysses and Gabe sl

Leon Couvillon, ILucien and Eraste cc
Landry, Paul Doucet, Raoul Pellerin, cc
Luc Langlinais; and B. Colgin, of
New Iberia. Delicious iced refresh
ments were served. The young c
folks are looking forward with joy- w
ous expectancy for another such en- th
joyable reunion. cr
Ten Pounds and a Half in 30 Days
A well kown citizen of Lafayette al
who has been in the habit of visiting ca
Grand Isle and other summer re- fa
sorts decided to stay at home this f
year and try the waters of Beause
jour Springs. In conversation with u
a Gazette man this gentleman stated cc
that he was delighted with his ex- sc
periment.and was more than pleased
with his change as his avoirdupois
had increased ten pounds and a
half in one month and his health

With such results it is no wonder
that Beausejour Springs is gaining.

ic --St. Peters Church celebrated
e on July 26th the Feast of St Ann.
e Rev Father Laforest had been
preparing for some time for this
a celebration. An association has "
e been formed among the ladies of
the ecclesiastical parish,. to be known
d as "The Congregation of the Ladies
dof St Ann," and on Wednesday
there were ax2 members enrolled si
)f which is certainly a good number sj
y i- so short a time. The sisiting °
,e clergy whom Father Laforest invited b
Lt to his assistance were Rev. Father it
e Moise of Washington, and Rev. a
Beau Valet the renowned Frenchb
`t Missionary. During the high mass,
g made so impressive by the solemn
- ceremonies of the Catholic church, a
a most beautiful panegyric to St. P
11 Ann, was preached by Father Beau ti
Valet. n
d The officers elected by the mem- h
s bers of the society are, Mrs. Esteve h
Breaux, President; Mrs. Gaston t<
Blot, Mrs. F. Comeaux, Mrs. A. h
Cheffer and Mrs. L. H. Prejean,
0 Vice Presidents; Mrs. D. A. Dimitry, h
1 Secretary; and Mrs. J. D. Breaux f
rs Treasurer. There is no doubt it i
wt will prove a powerful and influential P
o. rganization. n
-Mr. Maurice Francez, and Miss "
Mettie Martin, were married in La
fayette Wednesday July 23rd, Rev.
Father Healy officiating. Mr. Fran
cez is a son of the late Dr. R. J. i
Francez. Miss Marjin is the daugh
s ter of Mr. Martial Martin, a promi
is nent citizen of Lafayette. The si
t. people of Carencro extend to the i
e happy couple, their most sincere c:
congratulations. o0
-The new extension to the main
building of the Carencro Union Gin- O7
s ery is nearly completed. It is to be
used as a meeting hall.
r -The ball at Crouchet's Hall on 01
the night of July 27th was a social k
and financial success.
-Sheriff I. A. Broussard and as
party of friends, with Mr. A. C.
Guilbeau as pilot, spent the day th

a Carencro Springs, a few days ago. K
They seemed to have had a fine time n<
of it. Isaac knows where to go

Crouchet. After the bride and i
groomn with attendants had des:~e:
led from their carriages, they were le
plreceeded by the Carencro Biand to ir
the Church, playing a very pr;etty
wedding march. Rev Father T.afo
rest received the bridal couple at
the altar, and there performed those se
rites of the church always so solemn
and impressive. The bride was'
attired in a cream white silk.. A m{
beautiful bride and a handsome m
groom, always form a picture lovely an
to look upon, so it is not remarkable
that this happy pair was the recipient to
of so many hearty congratulations.
After the ceremony at the church
the bridal party went to the "Hall" "'
of Mr. Henry Crouchet the brother ge
of the bride, where refreshments th
were partaken of, and several hours
passed in happy dancing. MIr. aC
Ludovic Guilbeau, the son of Hon, r,
A. I. Guilbeau, is one of the most an
popular young men of our town, M
and admired by all for his many It
sterling qualities. Miss Crouchet is

The Gazette was afforded the op
portunity to visit that section of the in
country west of Breaux Bridge
covering an area of many miles, and nex
was pleased to notice the magnificent int
conditio~ f the crops. Some fields hax
were more intelligently cultivated teC
than otlfers, consequiently soime nr
crops were more promising than tor
others,.but there was not a patch is
along the whole route ihat can be pal
called poor. With anything like cot
fair prices for their products our
farmers ought to have a good sized
lump of the "'coin of the realm," a C£e
commodity heretofore decidedly
scarce.

but-think he will side with the senators, and
nmore's the pitys
Both our senators are opposed to inter
*. fering with the sale of futures, and will not
n question the honesty of their convictions;
but in our judgement most of the prostration
which has fallen upon the planting products
may be traced to the monopolistic and gi
f gantic trusts. The Cotton Exchange fixes the
a price of cotton before the seed in the grounl.
S Look at those who compose the Cotton Ex
change and attend the sales just for one
Y day and you can come to no other conclu
i sion than-the cotton crop is at the mercy of
r speculators. With a mojorlty in Congress
g opposed to these monopolists, the bill to kill
them of was rejected last session. It is to
be hoped that patriotism, integrity and. the
r inlerest of the hardworking laboring man
will prevail over bribery this winter. We
h believe that Blanchard and Robertson will
be found on the side of the planters.
a Some years ago Mr. A. Brower resigned
a position as engineer on the Southern
Pacific railroad, and returned to his farm
a three miles from town, and Mr. Brower has
no reason to regret the change, inasgpuch as
he has demonstrated the fact that The Gazette
e has repeatedly advanced, that it is possible
a to live on a farm not only contentedly but
have the best of every thing in the line of
wholesome food. Mr. Brower cures his own
hams, without the least trouble, making the
x family provision and selling some as well as
it lard to his neighbors. lie cans his own
jl peaches taken from his orchad, and he also
makes a nice palatable wine. In short he
s raises every thing he uses on his farm, except
flour and coffee and all this goes to show
that so conducted farming pays in this parish.
-What he is doing can be done by any farmer
in this highly favored parish.
Tihe Stock Law.
Inasmuch as there has been some discus
sion in regard to the true intent of the stuck
e law, to settle the controversy The Gazette
e called on the Mayor and asked his opinion
on the following questions:
i. If a halter is put on, and a person takes
oat an animal to graze on the streets, remain
ing with it, wonld it be violating the town
e stock law ?
02. If an animal is picketed or staked out
on the streets,. and its grazing limited to the
lenith of a ten feet rope, would it be violating
the law ?
3. If a few animals are driven on the
streets to graze, and a keeper remains with
them to see that they commit no depradations
or cause inconvenience, would it be violating
Y the law ?
To the first question the Mayor stated it
would not be violating the law, providing
no damage is done.
"To the second question the Mayor ans
I wered that it would be violating the law.
But an animal could be staked out on a va- I
cant lot without coming under the penalty of
the law.
To the third question the Mayor gave it
[ as his opinion that it would be violating the
Now, then, there need be no further mis

The Southwestern Louisiana Road
and Imntnigration Association, which
was organized at Lafayette June 2_, ,
will hold its second meeting at Crow
lew on Saturday of next week. This
association is made up from the rep
resentative men of the several par
ishes represented in the district, all
of whom feel a deep interest in
securing a better public road s.ystem
for our State-or at least for South
west Louisiana. All have given the
subject more or less thought and we
may expect to hear some intelligent
and instructive speeches thereon,
as well as numerous suggestions as
to plans to be persued in securing a
satisfactory remedy for our present
obnoxious road laws. The meeting.
will be one of interest for our citizens
generally, all of whom are cordially
invited to attend. The failure of
the State authorities to take any
action whatever toward supplying a
remedy for our present ineffective
and unsatisfactory road system
makes the formation of local.organ
izations for that purpose a necessity.
It will devolve upon our citizens to
see that the delegates who are in at
tendance are given a cordial welcome
and that the hospitalities of the town
are extended them while here.

Editor Lafayette Gazette:
As the post master is, absent since two
weeks, I feel it my dut, to reply to the
article published in your issue of the 29th
inst., by your correspondeut Cherokee. As
assistant post master I can certify that the
post office has not run short of stamps, ex
cept of one and two cents for a few days,
but not two weeks. There has at all times
been on hand stamped envelopes, which
owing to the dullness of the season, could
be used, instead of stamps, for a few days.
On the 24th of July $83 worth of stamps
were received at tlhis office. I hope in the
future that we can give satisfaction to all
complainants. J. BONNEMAISON.

To The Public.
For seventeen years I have been
in Lafayette engaged in the jewelry
and watch repairing business. I have
tried to attend strictly to my bui
ness, to give satisfaction, and not to.
interfere illegitimately with others. It
has come to my knowledge, that in
terested parties have circulated a
rumor that I intended to quit busi
ness, selling all my goods prepara
tory to leaving. This is to say, therq
is no fopdation to the rumor and
parties knowing me will -place no
confidenice in the report put in cir
culation for my injury.
