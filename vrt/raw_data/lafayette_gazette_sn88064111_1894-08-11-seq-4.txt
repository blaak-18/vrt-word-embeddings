The last-namqd condition is brought
about by treating boneswith sulphuric
acid (oil of vitriol), by which action
they are rendered soluble and more as
simnilable or assalabl--by the-soil, and
Bmeqgt tl by the young growing
plant.
in their natural hard condition,bones,
as obtained from rag and bone collee
teor, butchers,- lkackeries, etc., the
fertilizing ingredients (phosphoric acid
and nitrogen) are in an insoluble form,
and when applied to the land undergo
a very gradual change only; but when
they have been subjected to the action
-of acid they become didhtegrated or
partially dissolved, with the result that
they become more soluble and more
available to nitrification or the action
of soil baeteria,vwhich convert the ni
trogen and nitrogenous compounds into
'nitric acid, and plants can only aimi
late by their roots nitrogenin the form
of nitric acid.
It is necessary for agricultural pur
poses that the natural grease present
in commercial bones be removed, and
for this purpose some manufacturers
iglopt the principle of steaming the
bones prior to adding the acid, and
even in this steamed condition they
may be purchased in which state they
are less soluble, and consequently
slower in their action than the vitriol
ized article, but usually the bones are
ground to meal before being dissolved.
Two inch and two and a half inch
bones are used for permanent pastures,
applied when the land is laid out to
grass, as their action is very gradual,
and is spread over a number of years.
One inch bones are employed as top
dressing for permanent pasture, usual
ly ¶olled into the land in autumn.
One-eighth, one-fourth and one-half

Bone dust, meal 'and combings are
usually found effective at the time of
sowing barley, laid away with clover
or a one or two year's take. as in this
fine state of division their influence
begins to assert itself in time for the
barley plants to be benefited thereby,
whilst the greater part of their manu
rial properties are brought to bear
upon the clover after the removal of
the grain. Another use to which bones
iu this state is as an autumn top-dress
ing in combination with kainit for po
tatoes or turnips the following year,
but usually this method is not regarded
as being so satisfactory as applying the
kainit alone and supplanting the bone
meal with dissolved bones at the time
of sowing the turnips or potatoes.
As a general rule, it may be said that
if the land is heavy the former method
is more desirable than the use of the
bones in the dissolved condition at the
time of planting the potatoes or sow
ing the turnip seed. Pure dissolved
bones and superphosphates of lime have
long been rivals, as they are similar in
composition and used for very similar
purposes. Each of these manures have
their advocates, and it at once
becomes evident that a very large
proportion of the beneficial effects
of lime supers is due to the lime
in their composition. It is now gen
erally acknowledged that bones are
out and out superior in every way, ex
cept on certain soils: as to the price, it
will be found that pure vitriolized
bones are, on many manufacturers'
price list, quoted at double the price of
superphosphates of lime: this is due to
the better analysis the more direct the
influence, and more lasting the effect.
Pure dissolved 'bones are used for
root crops at the rate of 3 to 6 hundred

THE COUNTRY HOME.
It is Capable of Being Made Attractive Be
rondjhmt of the City.
The following excellent article.
gracefully written, sound in sentiment
and fruity with good advice. was writ
ten some time ago by Gen. Clement A.
Evans, of Georgia:
There is a claim about the story of
old Obed Edom. the honest, the brave
old farmer, who took the ark into the
house and kept it there until it could
be established in its national position.
It is certain that according to the laws
of his country it was his house. held
by good title and unencumbered by
mortgage. Doubtless the earliest duty
that a man owes to himself, his family,
society and state is to provide a home
where he can enjoy the sweets of fami
ly and social life, and which he can hold
as a free citizen of his commonwealth.
This is sometimes difficult to do, and
oftentimes nnforeseen difficulties prc
vent the attainment of his object. But
Uhappy is the man who is in such a
case" where he can call his home his
own, however humble it may.be.
The farm home is capable of attrac
tions that can not be given the houses
in the cities by th expenditnre of
thousands of dollars. he site on the
hill, the natural growth in the yard,
the broad view unobstructed by bricl
and mortar, the sweet, fresh air, the
pure water from the well or spring.
are all advantages which nature pro
vides for the family in the country
hoine. What a splendid lIlace in which
to rear the tender offspring of the
family into well-rounded maturity, free
from the excitement that overstrains
the forming nerves. Perhaps this has
something to di with the fact that so
many aueaemssfl men in cites proni.

aly yeart as toilers on the farm.
B ll mei make the country home
the most attractive spot on earth.

Much. ha biedn wisely written about
the neceasity of improving the farmer's
home life, and line must be added to
line and precept to precept until living
in the country-comes at last to a parity
with life in the town. To this end the
grouping of good homes must receive
more attention. The road that leads to
market, to the church and to the neigh.
bor must, by common consent and united
endear., be improved. The school
ht-to be a better structure
and 'e. thnhes must be near.
"Tell' a t home life," said a
philosopher, an "l will fortell the des
tiny of your country. As the family,
so the nation of families, and as the
farm home appears, so may we judge
the real prosperity of the land. Sad
indeed the situation of a land where all
its glory is just the gilding that ap
pears in the vain show of municipal
wealth, where the homes of the people
express by a mournful dilapidation
either that poverty prevails or the ad
vantages of the country home are not
appreciated.
Pip at Pasture.
The breeding sows and all young
pigs should be turned topasture through
the summer months, says an exchange.
It promotes health and thrift to give
them the free air to breathe in, the
clean earth to live on dpd burrow in
and the fresh grasses to pasture on.
Don't be afraid of the rooting. It does
the pigs good ail never hurts the land.
But, it is sometimes said, if the pigs
are all at pasture we lose the large pile
of manure that would be made in the
cellar, and the fields will suffer to that
extent. Not at all. The pigs make as
much manure at pasture as when con
fined in pens. The only difference is
that in the case of the pasturing it is
scattered over the land where it is al
ways needed.
If one wants the effect of this method
of manuring on his tilled fields a good
practice is to fence off a lot proportion
ate to the number of pigs and give them
the run of it for the season. The mat
ter of a distribution of the manure is
easily provided for by -changing their
feeding grounds from time to time dur
- the sunmmer. The next season the
can be plowed and cropped, the ma
fnuifig having cost no labor or eartage
while the pigs are changed to pastures
new.
In many cases there are lots on the
farm rough and foul with brakes,
shrubs and bushes, that may be cleared
through such management. But on a
larger scale, a more intelligent manage
ment and the appropriation of means
easily within reach, there may much
more of this kind of stock be made prof
itable on our farms than is now kept.
Southern Farm.
Plenty of Clean WVater.
As an egg is more than nine-tenths
water, the importance of supplying the
hens with all the water they require
can not be too strongly urged. Water
not only enters into the composition of
an egg as the leading substance but it
fulfills other purposes. It is essential
to the bird as a solvent to the food,
when hard grains are fed as the giz
zard that grinds the grain to powder,
but the water is thus necessary to as
sist the digestion and to convert the
food into blood. It is generally sup
posed that birds are not partial to
clean water and will drink from filthy
pools. But the fact is the hen is rather
fastidious and will always prefer pure
water and clean food when she has
leave to attain such. If she is expected
to lay well she will require more than
food.-Southern Farm.

been a disposition to breed this class of
horses, as they have proven to be more
profitable on the whole.
-Two pounds of good butter is worth
as much as a bushel of wheat, or seven

make 400 pounds of butter in a year.
At twenty-five cent a pound this is

of cotton, and you have the cowv left
-The poultry-breeding season is now
practically over, and after the confine
ment to the breedings pen and the
strain of egg production and incuba
tion has greatly reduced the vitality of
the hens, they now need all the stimu

-A young orchard may be cultivated
for one or two years, or until it has
made too much growvth and acquired
large roots. Potatoes and cabbages are
excellent, as they reqdire clean cultive-.
tion, and the manure used in the rows
will also benefit the trees. If the
growth of the trees is too rapid, how

for one or twoyears and then cultivated
again.

the French premier insists that it only
has reference to the marriage of French

one in twenty of the rural people had

A SYMPATHETIC NATURE.
The Cheering-Up Briuness a Good BDul
ness to BIe In.
When the hard times began last year
it was reported that a clever woman
declared that if she" had to earn her
living she would become a "general
Ssyanmpathizer,"' going to anyone who
wishod to pour out her troubles and
worries. listening and comforting for a
fixed sum per hour: the interviews to
be strictly confidential, and the profes
sional sympathizer never to allow
herself to have pains or trials greater
than those of her client. This seemed
an odd little fancy, as impracticable as
original, until a short time ago, when,
reading over the lists which a wom
an's exchange prepares to meet the
wants of its patrons, the eye fell upon
this item: "In the cheering-up busi
ness. A lady who has had successful
experience will read to or amuse in
valids or convalescents." Then there
is such an occupation, after all,
and one which this cheering
lady has made successful as well.
llHow does she manage her deli
cate work? by what cunningly-de
- vised means has she bottled up the
sunshine which carries its brightness
Sinto the lives of those who are stran

Sshe draw sparkling, exhilarating
r draughts? and who, after she has spent
hcr day in "reading to and amusing in
valids and convalescents." cheers her
when twilight gives her back to her
Sself?
It is a beautiful and self-effacing oc
Scupation. demanding special gifts of
tact and sweetness, and calling for
Skeenness of eye and quickness of ear,
i and also, contradictorily enough, for a
Scertain judicious near-sightedness and
I mental deafness, which can leave un
noticed and unheard all that tends to
mar the perfect harmony which it is so
essential to maintain. WVhile as a means

Sundoubtedly new, it is really
an old, very old, vocation, to

MIRACLES IN ENGLAND.
Devil Hunting by the Carolln of the.
sevsienease ceassep.
iii the tefvoi df the Cltholip resetion
in the latter half of the aixteEizth eena
tury, Europe seemed ablaze. with
miracles. Saints, it is said, flew in the
air, were in two places at once, uttered
prophecies and raised- the dead. En
gland, the theater of a supreme papal
efforts hallowed with the blood of
many martyrs, seemed alone to lie un
der , the shadow of a supernatural
eclipse. These were miracles, indeed,
but as a rule they were insignifloant or
ineffective. The miraculous cross of
St. Donats was extinguished by a com
mission of inquiry. The sudden deaths
of unjust judges or jurymen by jail.
fever; the tide ceasing to flow at Lon
don bridge on the morning of Cam
pion's execution; the voice from the
Thames crying ,aloud on the death of
the English Jezebel, "Forty years of
reign and an enternity of punishment!"
and others like prodigies, either failed
-to attain notoriety or to impress the
popular imagination.
To this apparent dearth of famous
miracles in Elizabethan England there
is on record one very notable excep
tion. At a critical moment of the re
ligious conflict (1585-1586) there was
manifested a group of phenomena in
connection with the casting out of
devils which has been hailed by Catho
lic historians as shedding lustef upon
the fame of their martyrs, and adding
new glories to the Roman church.
The prodigies in question were per
formed in the light of day, in the
neighborhood of London, in the houses
of noblemen and distinguished Cath
olics-at Lord Vaux's at Hackney, at
the earl of Lincoln's in Cannon Row,
at Fulmer and Uxbridge, and above all
in Sir George Peckham's house at Den
ham, in Bucks.
The exorcists to whom the credit was
given were a dozen or more of the best
known missionary priests, among
whom were several who in virtue of the
recent decree of Leo XIII. are now hon
ored with the title of venerable mar
tyrs. Their leader or conductor in the
affair was Father William Westen, su
perior of the Jesuits, or rather at that
moment the only known Jesuit in En
gland, and afterward notorious for the
part he played in the famous Wisbeach
"'Stirs;" while the most active of his
co-operators was the venerable
Robert Dibdale, who was hanged
at Tyburn the 8th of Octo
ber, 1586. They were assisted
by John Cornelius, a "covert" or secret
Jesuit, and Mr. Yaxley, both after
ward enrolled among the martyrs; by
Ballard, a seminary priest, not a mar
tyr, but executed for complicity in the
Babington Plot; by Christopher Thules,
who became prominent as one of the
"'Appellant" priests; by Antony Tyr
rell, who, after changing his religion
two or three times, became for many
years an Anglican clergyman, and by
several others.
The manifestations continued from
first to last for about eighteen months,
and from October, 1585, to June, 1586,
were of almost daily occurence. The
witnesses were numerous and in high
position. On one occasion there drove
up to the Denham house to see the
miracles five coaches full of gentlemen.

WHY CHOLERA KILLS.
Generation of the Deadly Nitrate by the
Bacllus.
When an adventurous scientist de
clared that he had swallowed any
amount of cholera cultures without in
jury, there was a good deal of incred
ulous head-shaking. and while the
doubters could not really dispute the
statements made, they insisted that
there must be something behind it all;
for if cholera baccilli were really them
selves and nobody else, why didn't the
man die? And now it appears that it
isn't the well-bred, properly-conducted
bacillus that does the mischief, but a
substance that they manufacture from
the contents of the human interior
where they take up their abiding
place. The bacilli proceed to form what
is known as ditrite, a most deadly poi
son. This substance is by the baccilli
generated from many vegetables, es
pecially cauliflower, lettuce, beets and
turnips. MIeat contains but a limited
amount of convertible material, hence
the prevailing idea that avegetables are
to be eaten with prudence during
cholera seasons, while meat in small
quantities and Indian corn, barely and
the like are much safer articles of diet.
It is further asserted that there are
other bacteria found in the intestiness
of men and animals that are capable of
generating nitrites, but that the chol
era bacillus produces over forty thou
sand times more thanany other creat
ure. If there is no suitable substance
found by the cholera bacilli upon
which to work, they form latic and
other acids, but these rarely cause
serious ills. They sometimes give rise
to what is known as cholerine, which
frequently prevails to a considerable
extent-during epideaics of cholera,
