lIUCKLES GUILTY.
E" ENCE AGAINST. HIM WAS
DLRECT AND POSITIVE.
e... Sontcnced to One Year's Impri
, nri nt in the Parish Jail-Failed
Confu-e Officer Hull.
ui-e n ice cutter. J. Huckles, had a trial
ef :re H n. A. D. Land, judge of the
di;trict cmurt. yesterday afternoon. The
, c'iare under the law is trespass. for
w:irch he wns tried. His offense was cut
ting guy wires of the Cumber'and Tele
phone Company's pole at the intersection
of Common, Sprague and Texas streets
on the night, February 13. The eivdence
against him was positive and conclusive.
Officer Hull recognized and identified
him beyond a doubt as the man who cut
the wires. Huckles attempted to escape
and ran in the direction of the hall, and
then Sprague street, but was headed off,
when he turned and ran down Texas
street with the officer in close pursuit.
While being pursued Huckles threw
away his clippers which were afterwards
recovered by Officers Hull and Roscoe.
The best efforts of the defendant's attor
neys failed to move Officer Hull in his
testimony, and they also failed in an at
tempt to weaken his evidence by one of
their witnesses who was contradicted.
This effort to disprove Officer Hull was
a dismal failure. Subjected to a most
rigid cross examination, Officer Hull
never faltered -and his statements were
most forceful because they were true and
could not be contradicted.
Defendant's counsel then called Huck
les to testify. He related that he with
others were at the Labor Union hall on
the night. of the wire cutting with men
who would prove his innocence. In this
They failed. He denied most solemnly
having c ut the wire and alleged that
some other man who had escaped while
he fell the innocent victim to the watch
finess and the activity of a fearless and
loyal officer. He admitted he was a Union
man, of' the Electrical Workers, and had
ld cussed and taken an active part in the
strike and been on a committee of griev
ance. He insisted that he was not the
man who had cut the wire.
Lott rwine was heard in behalf of the
defendant. He skid that on the night of
the wire, cutting he and Huckles and
others were at the Labor Union hall,
which be left at abouIt p4O. In his state
oeat Hadkes admitted that it was zo:ao
when ie left the hall, a little after Ir
vine had gone out This discrepancy is
dte perhaps to the difference in their
e keepers. It was about zo-.:o,when
Iluckles was in the police station utnder
arrest.
The defendant:. Huckles, had for coun
selL AR. Smith, Esq.. and Mr. J. P.
Wells. who did all they could for their
client, but, although they brought to bear
all their talent and ingenuity and all the
technicalities of law, it was manifest that
they had a hopelesa case.
District Attorney Land represented
the State most creditably.
The. judge having reviewed the ease
aid the law, sentenced MHi$gs to ase
year's intrisonmaept in the parish jail.
The limit is, two years but be teampered
-ustice with amery.
In the court rees tlhere was a large
anuber of reprýsentatiw citizens, men
who had neglected their business to at
tend the trial of the case. Their pres.
eace was dieated by a spirit in response
to a moral support of the law.
ldckles recqjred his setapot wi boyt
apparent emotion and eapressed regrets
oear his act. He is a yount man in his
htra years of manhood. His face is
smaoth, and when studied closely would
leave a favorable imptession. We mean
that he has not-a vicious face, which is
so strildg in siso meen. Being young in
years and over-ralows, he has been in
describably criminal; he has committed
ar t.which threatened the property and
the lives of innocent people who had no
concern i' the stmt, who could have no
direct interest in the telephone company,
who were in no manner responsible for
his and the grievances of the men he rep
resented. If he could recall his act. If
he would speak But he has been con
vited, law and order have triumphed
over lawlessness, and justice prevails in
a community of civilized citizens.

1Ae Confederate Reunion.'
The accompanying letter, written by
Mr. Page M. Baker, editor of the New
Orleans Times-Democrat, is in the in
t.rt of the reunion of the Veterans
of the Confederacy. The letter is con
-: ticuo Scy patriotic and' is published by
request of Colonel J. A. Harral. U. C.
..a.le-.e-c..mi on General Gordan's
os and chairman of the press com
,ittLe. The welcome which New O:
leansvtil accord to the old Coro-;eds

e' said that no city in the South can en
r t'rtain so well as New Orleans. espe
-cilvly when the guests are Veterans of
ite gmoriou. Lost Cause-New Orleans
siotld be-declared and fixed as the
s"lace at which all reunions of Confed
e erate Veterans shall he held hereafter.
Why not? The letter follows:
Indications are plentiful that the re
nt ion to be held in New Orleans May
e to. 20, 21 and 22. by the United Con
federate Veterans will be the most
F worthily memorable event in the history
s of the organization.
It is now more than twoscore years
since the people of the South, animated
s with a spirit than which there is noth
ing finer in human history, united as
one man in the effort to resist the in
S vasion made by the Northern States,
to defend the traditional principle of
local self-government and to maintain,
' in unimpaired vigor, the idea of state's
s sovereignty. Without in any sense seek
t ing to stir the treacherous ashes of that
period of the national life, it is sufficient
e to state that the Southern people were
then, as they have always been, actuat
ed by motives of disinterested patriot
ism. Responding promptly to the call to
arms, the old, the middle-aged and the
goung, "flocked gaily to' the fight," and
for four years of fiercest war demon
strated that they were willing to die fbr
r an idea. Discriminating critics of his
t tory now recognize that the Confeder
ate soldier fought only for what all
- freedom should be willing to fight. It
is now clear to all that the spirit of "he
I that loseth his life shall save it"--the
I spirit of "greater love hath no man than
-this, that he lay down his life for his
" friend"-gave impulse and character to
the Confederacy from the moment
when Mr. Davis was inaugurated at
Montgomery to the hour when General
F Lee surrendered at Appomattox.
-It is right that the people of the
South,. of the Union and of the world,
know this. There was a time when
Americans of the Northern States
failed to comprehend the real signifi
cance of the Confederacy; a time when
they failed to appreciate the controlling
motive tpf the Confederate. oldier; a
time when the lingering animosities of
war blurred the historical perspective
and made it difficult, if not impossible,
for Federsl ana Confederate to appraise
ac y one another's character. That
time is now happily passing if. indeed,
it has not already passed. When Lee
surrendered at Appomattox a great
issue was decided. For four years Fed
I eral and Confederate had struggled in
clyil war. Each side had spoken it.
mind from the cannon's mouth. The de
clamation was vociferous, the rhetoric
magnificent. the argument conclusive.
And when the foot-sore Confederate
soldier surrendered his gun. wrung the
hands of his comradqs in silence, and
buttoning his 'parole in his faded gray
packet, as Grady has pictured him. be
gasn the stow and painful homeward
journey, he realized that the war was
over, that slavery was abolished, and
that, henceforth, the right to secede
trom the Union coul4 have no place in
the American polity.
This, however, was not the complete
significance of Appomattox. The sur
render of Lee's army, the parole of the
Confederate soldier, meant more than
the emancipation of a race, more than
the political welding together of sept
arate and individual States. It meant
that with the, echo of the last gun should
die every ignoble prejudice ;and mem
ory; that beneath the repedding feat
ures of war should be discerned the
redeeming nobleness of both Federal
and Confederate; that a reciprocal con
fidence should solidify and purify our
political life; and, finally, that, as one
nation, we should become one people.
It is not too much to say that this
larger significance of the titanic strug
gle of forty years ago is now under
stood and appreciated throughout the
Union. Recently, and especially within
the last few years, the feeling has be
come. strong among thinking men every

them to see the right," and that it was
in the inscrutabte wisdom of Provi
l.ence ptat the pure purposes of the
South vere crossed and her brave
armnit were overwhelmed.
It is with these feelings, and feelie
kindred to these. that Americans of the
South are looking forward to the next
anuttal reunion of Confederate Veter
ans. The I cal cotumitt e is act; eiv at
nxors. Smle pr paratier-s are makiog
to recrir thw 1 o of ex-Confederates
that w i rl -on convvrge upon New Or
lears from every section of the Union.
The people of this city hope and ex
port that the grim men in gray rwho
fort} 'ears ago imperiled all f r tL ir
country-and regretted not that they
iniperi'ed it wi1 come. in large num
ber, to this hospitable old city of ours
and receive here the welcome and ben
ediction of their grateful countr-men.
The date set for the reunion draws
near. We want the venerable and ven
erated heroes-the thin gray line that
is growing thinner every year-to move
with martial tread once more through
the streets of the metropolis of the
South. From Louisiana and her neigh
boring States of Mississippi. Alabama,
Texas and Arkansas; from far away
Tennessee and Florida; from farther
away Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia,
Kentucky and Maryland, and from the
more distant Northern and Eastern
States in which Southerners have, since
the war, found congenial homes and
won enduring reputation-from every
point in, the Union: we desire that ex
Confederates and the sons and daugh
ters of ex-Confederates shall come to
New Orleans.
In the impressive "procession will be
men who represent the splendid sol
diery of the South that was ready at the
call. of duty-and is ready still-to fight
valiantly and to. die without a mur
mur. Men who fought not for fame, not
for empire, not (thank God) for money
but for friends and kinsmen, for home
and country! In reflecting upon what
the Confederate soldier was, as well as
upon what he did, the people of New
Orleans have highly resolved that the
reunion this year shall be the most in
teresting, the most impressive and the
most successful of all that have been
held by the heroes in gray. The organi
zation of United Confederate Veterans
has, it is true, reached, if it has not
passed. its zenith. Its meridian splendor
--,the force and the fire that once in
hered to it-has waned with the quick
going years. Against it the fierce gales
of necessity, and the fiercer gales of
time itself, have blown pitilessly. Num
erically, its power is necessarily fast
di anishing; morally, its energy . for
good is strengthening every hour. The
memories awakened by it and the pride
stirred by a sight of the Confederate
veterans as they pass in annual review
on the occasion of these reunions-are
forever consecrated and hallowed in
the hearts of the Southern people. We
need not recount all the names on the
sacred list, nor tell the sad, brave story
over in all its desolate grandeur of ideal
and starving suffering; but the picture;
sketched 6r finished, is now and always
will be mirrored in the eyes of every
beholder: If it is only for a moment the
people of the South will, on these occa
sions of Confederate reunions, lift the
nobly pathetic picture and reverently
uncovei before it; for spite the effacing
influence of time, it may never be for
gotten that what William of Orange's
followers were to Holland, rhat the
men who fought -with Bruce and Wal
lace were to Sebtland 'what `Marathon's
"ten thousand" were to Greece, what,
indeed, Thermopylae's "three hundred"
were to Sparta, the Confederate sol
diers were, are, and will be-always
to Americans of the Southern States.
It is to the Confederate soldier-to
his high example in courage, in forti
tude, in patience and in the capacity to
,suffer and to be still-that the younger
generation of the South owes whatever
is worthy in its civilization. This debt
may never be paid, certainly not within
the life-tihne of the Confederate soldier;
but the heroic sacrifice and the inspirit
ing example can live again in our re
membrance and in the remembrance of
our children. The reunion to be held
in May will remind us of the high civic
responsibility that is ours and will
prompt us to a wider and a wiser pa
ti atism. It will teach us that the lamp
of idealism should be kept forever
glowing, and it will help the world to
understand that the spirit of the Con
federate soldier, like the breath of the
Holy man, died not with the prophet
but survived him.

MARDI GRAS DAY.
Tuesday, February 24, Mardi Gras.
A feast of jollification observed in all
Latin countries. In New Orleans it is
an event which attracts hundreds of
thousands of visitors from every sec
tion of the United States. It is the day
when the many festivities of weeks are
climaxed with the welcome and the de
monstration by Rex. Even in the days
of Rome's splendor their Mardi Gras
were tame affairs compared to New
Orleans. With Mardi Gras will close
the social festivities of the season. The
day following. Ash Wednesday. is the
beginning of Lent, when, during forty
days, the religious, especially Catholics,
must observe the rigid abstinence from
all pleasures as enjoined by the edicts
of their Church. Lent is ended with
Easter, the greatest of all feasts which
commemorates the triumph of Christ
over Death and the Grave.
