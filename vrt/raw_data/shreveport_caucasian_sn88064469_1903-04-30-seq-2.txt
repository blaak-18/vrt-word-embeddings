Washington. April 24.-As a result
of the investigation of the postoffice
department affair Postmaster f;ener
al Payne Thursday announced the
summary dismissal of James N. TV
ner, assistant attorney general tot
the postoffice department, and charger
that all the papers and records in tn'
safe of Tyner s office had been ab
stracted by Mrs. Tyner. wife of tn'
dischargd officer, with the assistancr
of others. The postmater g'nera
says that Mrs. Tyner had refused the
demand of the government for the pa
pers, and said circumstances in thi
case would be submitted by him to
the department of justice at once. Th.
question of arrests is now under con
sideration, and will be passed on im
mediately by Attorney General Knox
Mrs. Tyner carre to the office of the
assistant general attorney at 5:45 p

thority to have Mrs. Tyner ejecteor

too late. When the inspector returned
Mrs. Tyner had left. The safe, on he
In, examined, was f[ound to be empt v
The affair created much excitemnit
among the investigating officials, itt
the news was concealed carefully lron
We public. Two inspectors were trrs
patched to the Tyner residence to re
cover the papers. Mrs. Tyner refused
4 give them up, saying she was acting
under the direction of her husband
She told the inspectors, so they report
ed, that they had no right to the pa
pers, as Mr. Tyner was still assistant
attorney general, and, moreover, in
sisted that the papers were all of a
private charcter. It is suspected at
the department that the papers have
some connection with the recent con
duct of the office. Some weeks ago a
turf investment concern, whose at
fairs were aired in court, alleged that
its operations and working methods
had been sanctioned by the assistant
attorney general for the postoHice de
partment. The charges involving the
office of the assistant attorney gener
al and a lawyer formerly connected
with the office were ventilated, and an
investigation was ordered by the
postmaster general. This iwas really
the inception of the Investigation that
has spread into every part of the de
partment. The complaints crystal
lized into a formal request for Mr
Tyner's resignation, signed by Post
master General Payne on March 2
last.
AFTER A LICENSE.
There Is Mch Discussion as to Whether
it Will Be (ranted Vanderbilt.
London, April 24.-William K. Van
derbilt has returned to Paris. His hur
ried visit to London was connected
with procuring a special marriage Ii
cense. There is much discussion as
to whether a license could be issued
under the cigctatstances. it was said
the ecclesiastical' court could not re
fuse, whatever its feelings in -regard
to divorced persons, but it was added
that it could'delay mutters probably
a fortnight by requiring the production
of documents which would have to be
obtained from America. At the Arch
bishop of Canterburys sofflce it was said
that the archbishop has the undoubted
right to refuse a license. No applica
tion has yet been received from Mr
Vanderbilt. For an ordinary license
one of the parties must live in any
parish here for three weeks and have
the banns read in the church on three
successive Sundays. The French for
malities require a residence of six
months.

CAKE KNOWLEDGE.
Some of the Nice Points of Suceeuafri
Mixing and Baking.
Many of the long, narrow tins In
which a pound of delicate crackers are
packed make the nicest pans for bak
ing a small loaf of cake. There is one
variety, however, to avoid. It is the
tin with a rolled over edge inside. If
you bake cake In this pan, a struggle
awaits you when It conies to get it out
whole. One pound baking powder or
cocoa cans bake small cakes nicely and
allow them to be cut in sightly round
slices.
If possible, never use coarse granu
lated sugar in making cake. The re
sult is a coarse texture and a hard
crust. no matter how carefully the bat
ter has been mixed.
A very "must have" for cake is a
wire stand for cooling it when taken
from the pan. This small utensil canii
be purchased for 10 cents. It earns its
cost many times over, for quick cooling
is a vast improvement over setting hot
cake on the bottom of the tin from
which it has just been taken. All the
moisture which is evaporated when
cake rests on a cooler remains in it and
tends to make it wet and heavy whln
set on a solid surface.
Never attempt to bake sponge rake
unless you have a tire which will slow
down to a very moderate heat and
keep about that temperature.
The whites of eggs which are really
new laid-not more than twenty-four
hours--will not beit to the dry fr-it
demanded in so nitny recipes. Anote
er reason why the whites of good fresh
eggs will not froth in hot weather i.
because they have not been chilled
Eggs for cake baking should always
be stored in the refrigerator.
Many a cooking teacher instructs a
pupil to listen whether -a -;ke sings
in the tin or nii. T-Iy -lyaiii wheti
the 'singing" is almost over Ite aIke
Is done. There are a nul ti-sr of easier
and quite as reliable tests. Wheli the
cake begins to shrink away slightly
from the sides of the pain. when you
can stick in a tootlipick and have it
come out clear or when the top crust
can be touched with the tip of the lin
ger and it springs back lirnuly, leaving
no dent, the cake may be taken from
the oven.
If you find you have put too much
flour in a cake, do not thin with milk.
but with beaten egg. adding It gradu
ally till the batter reaches a proper
thickness. Milk would impoverish the
taste of the cake; egg enriches It.
The proper time to add flavoring to
a cake is after the mixture has been
thoroughly creamed and just before
the flour is added. Spices should be
sifted in with the flour.
Never leave the whites of eggs to
stand after heating them to the re
quired point of frothiness. Fold them
lightly into the cake mixture, then set
It to bake.-Table Talk.
Art Even In Sewing en a Button.
There is art even in such a prosaic
matter as sewing on buttons. The
ordinary operator makes a knot in the
cotton, passes the needle through the
material from the under part and
cheerfully accomplishes her task. The
stronger the thread the more satislied
she will be. But when the garment is
dealt with in the wash and ironing
time comes round the knot upon which
the work had depended forms a hard
lump, which cannot possibly resist the
heavy and sharp sides of the iron, the
latter cuts It off. or certainly impairs
its strength, and the wearer is left but
tonless.
The moral is obvious. Start sewing
from the outside or from the inside be
fore putting on the button. The latter,
being fairly tight, will protect the knot
and the smooth thread at the back will
not be cut.
A Dainty Cake.
Cream one-third of a cup of butter.
Add gradually half a cup cf sugar,
then the well beaten yolks of two eggs,
mixed with a second half cup of sugar.
and, alternately, half a cup of milk and
one cup a'nd three-fourths of flour, sift
ed with two and one-half level tea
spoonfuls of baking powder. Lastly,
add the whites of two eggs, beaten dry.
Bake in three layer cake tins of small
size and put the layers together with
an orange cream filling. Spread the
top very lightly with the filling. Into
this press orange sections. sprinkling
the whole with powdered sugar.
For the filling, scald one cup of
orange juice with the juice of half a
ORANGE CREAM CAKE.
lemon and one-third of a cup of sugar.
Into this stir two and one-half table
spoonfuls of cornstarch. mixed with
a second third of a cup of sugar. Stir
and cook until the mixture thickens,
then cook over hot water about ten
minutes. Add a tablespoonful of but
ter, a few grains of salt and the yolks
of two eggs, beaten very light. Thon
add. lastly, the whites of two eg-,.
beaten dry. Use when partly cooled.

Don't use tea leaves in swoeping a

erbocker suiting. Linen is so well liked
that one finds it in every quality and
every degree of shade from the natural
flax to the bleached batiste, whichlis
so fine that it is a wonder it is ever wo
ven. Many beautiful and dressy house
frocks are made of pure white linen
in such weave as best pleases the wear
er. They are trimmed with rather
heavy lace in cream and sometimes
even in butter color. The linens are
shown in all the season's best colors.
and they are fast, so that the wearer
need not fear to put as much trimunini.
I as she will on them. The tints are
blue, pink, heliotrope and sulphur yel
low. These are all beautiful when
trimmed with lace.
Lace in small separate figures called
medallions is set along the front fold
on yokes and among tucks wherever
they seem called for. They are very
dainty and are used on so many of t!e
waists and skirts that it would be un
profitable to mention them in detail.
A long list of materials especially
adapted for waists for summer are
shown, and it seems that nearly every
thing is mercerized. This means that
the fabric has been made frosty and
lustrous by some treatment with silica
ground to an impalpable powder. It is
certainly handsome, but so far as my
experience goes will not survive the
laundry. So let whoever buys it be
careful and keep it out of the water.
Everything, even the stiff swiss mus
lins, is mercerized. The new silk and
linen batistes are exquisite. They
show lacy lines and lines where there
are swivel woven blossoms in natural
colors on a natural grass tint. Silk
and cotton woven together make an
other very delicate and dainty fabric,
for the most part in tints with Pom
padour figures.
Quite a number of the light materials
have a border of embroidery woven
along the edge so that It can be utilized
as trimming. Some materials are
shown with quite wide stripes of op:"n
work like lace or embroidery, and be
tween them the plain linen.
Shirt waists are made of all of thlm'e
and many more, but the shirt waists
of this season are marked by neater ef
fects than they were-that is, they are
built more compactly. Few of thetii
have that ugly and obstreperous exten
sion to go under the belt. These have
the finish of a belt, and very nwity
waists have a snug lining stiffe'!*d
with featherbone, which washes lilk
cord.
Almost every waist has the lis";p
sleeves, with cuffs narrow or deop. ,<
