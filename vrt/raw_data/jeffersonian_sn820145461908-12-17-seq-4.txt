PAGE FOUR
ZETTERS FHO7I THE PEOPLE
RESTRICT IMMIGRATION.
Brunswick, Ga., Nov. 27, 1908.
Dear Mr. Watson: Referring back
to a recent letter of mine as to full
reorganization, permit me to add the
following suggestion:
I believe the time has come when
some check should be placed on im
migration to this country, resulting,
as it has, in a three-fold evil, i. e.,
unjust competition with our native
born labor, filling the country with
an uneducated class, not even speak
ing our national language —which is
in the teeth of our idea of an edu
cated people —and supplying the ma
terial out of which anarchists, nihil
ists and, generally, criminals are
made. All this is detrimental to our
government and, particularly, to the
caliber of its citizenry.
I believe that nearly all our intel
ligent citizens see the evil and would
gladly welcome a remedy. The labor
element, likewise, would gladly aid
in checking immigration, because of
its unjust competition with them in
their struggle for a living and their
efforts to properly care for and edu
cate their children.
If I am right, then it is clear that
a party proposing to check immigra
tion would hr ve a tremendous follow
ing, and, with a political platform
containing a plank to that end, suc
cess would be almost assured.
I would suggest the limitation
should be restriction of all over a
certain age —say twelve years —who
cannot read, write and speak the
English language. This would give
us an educated class of immigrants,
and maintain the purity of our lan
guage, and also tend largely to pre
vent an influx of foreign criminals —
what we call “the scum of foreign
countries. ’ ’
It would also prevent unreasonable
discrimination against the Eastern
races, and, the law being universal in
its intendment and application, we
would need no protection against
them, but let them come if they
measure up to the requirement —that
is to say, ability to read, write and
speak English.
This would unquestionably do
away with all complaint by the East
ern countries against us and virtual
ly, if not actually, put an end to the
reasonable complaint of China and
Japan against our immigration .laws,
and consequent fear of wars from
that source. Lastly, it would reduce
immigration to an enormous extent,
say at least seventy-five per cent,
and we would soon get r.d of listen
ing to foreign jargon, instead of our
grand old language.
The time has come that this course
is absolutely necessary, in my hum
ble judgment, to save our country
from ruin at the hands of anarchist
and nihilist. This evil menaces us
from indiscriminate immigration.
Our own foreign born cit zens recog
nize it, and would be as quick to ap
ply a remedy as a native born.
May your “shadow never grow
less” and success attend you.
Your friend,
Francis H. Harris.
PRESENTS THE CASE WELL.
-
Thomaston, Ga., Nov. 18, 1908.
My Dear Friend: Allow me to say
a few words in regard to the past
election, reorganization, etc.
Perhaps I am more familiar with
the ways of the common people than
you are, being in the very mi&st of
them myself. lam sorry to say that
I am thoroughly disgusted with some
of the boys that call themselves true
Populists.
On the other hand, I feel both
proud and grateful to know that
there is still thousands of true and
tried Jeffersonians who will always
stick to you, and these, I must say, I
believe are the best element of peo
ple to be found on the globe.
But the question now confronts us,
is there enough of this element to
keep up the fight. I think this a ques
tion to be well considered. I know
of hundreds of Populists that said
they were too busy to go to the polls
and vote on election day, thereby
manifesting gross indifference to the
Populist cause.
But we must not lose sight of the
fact that there were hundreds of
good people that "would have voted
for you, but were prohibited on ac
count of the rainy day. We know
it is impossible to conduct a cam
paign without considerable funds,
and I feel ashamed that our people
did not contribute more liberally. Am
very sorry to know that the expense
out of your own pocket was so heavy,
and we realize the fact that to per
petuate a thing like that would ulti
mately ruin you financially, and to
ask you to make the sacrifice, that I
know you would make, to keep up the
party, I believe would be asking too
much of you.
I know you will never abandon the
principles that you have fought for
so long, and God forbid that any true
Jeffersonian ever shall, but for you
to conduct another campaign under
such trying difficulties as you did in
the one just closed, I, for one, could
hardly demand it of you.
However, if your ambition to see
your noble principles reach success
moves you to keep up the fight, I as
sure you I am ever with you.
In my judgment, if we should or
ganize our forces again, we should
do it under a new name, and that
name should be the Jeffersonian
Democratic party, as there are thou
sands of good people that would sup
port ►you, but will not vote a ticket
unless it has Democrat on it somehow
or some where.
I was one of the managers in
Thomaston, Ga., November the third,
and was requested to do so by some
of the strongest Democrats in that
city. Am glad to inform you that
there was no effort made to treat you
unfair; and I heard some Strong
Democrats say, I don’t want to vote
for Bryan, but will have to do it for
the sake of the party.
I only offer these remarks for your
consideration, as I fully realize my
inability to advise you in so impor
tant a matter as this.
Hoping that you are enjoying the
Jeffersonian
best of health, I am very respectfully
'your friend,
W. T. Stewart.
A KIND WORD FROM ALABAMA.
Vineland, Ala., Nov. 11, 1998.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: When one care
fully considers the situation it seems
that it „would have been almost a
matter of impossibility for you to
have carried the state of Georgia, but
I could not help but sincerely wish
for you to carry the state, even
though you lost it. There were only
sixty votes polled here. Bryan re
ceived thirty-four, Watson, twen
ty, and there were six that
would not vote at all, that is, they
would not vote the national ticket.
With best wishes for yourself and
The Jeffersonians, I beg to remain,
your sincere friend,
Taylor J. Shields.
CORRECTING AN OVERSIGHT.
Luther, Fla., Nov. 30, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: After reading the last
issue of The Jeffersonian, I find where
some little mistake was made in the
contributions.
While 50 cents isn’t much, I ought
to have the credit of it. If you
look back over your letters, you will*
find that I ask you to send J. H. An
derson at Ebb, Fla., a sample copy of
your paper, and that I enclosed 50
cents in stamps for myself to help
distribute literature. Please correct
this. It was A. O. Folsom, instead
of J. H. Anderson.
Wishing you great success,
Yours truly,
A. O. Folsom.
A NOBLE SPIRIT.
Texarkana, Ark., Nov. 24, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson: *
I heartily agree with you in calling
an early convention to organize, for
mulate plans, put speakers in the
field, and I would suggest that we
organize clubs, and that each mem
ber of such clubs be required to pay
twenty-five cents per quarter for
campaign funds. I am almost eighty
years old, and very feeble, and poor
as the poorest, but I can and will pay
that much.
Very respectfully, yours in the
cause,
J. M. Ramsey.

ONE OF THE FINEST MEN IN
THE STATE.
LaGrange, Ga., Nov. 29, 1908.
My Dear Friend: I write to ex
press my continued affectionate re
membrances of you, and my regrets
that it was not practicable for you
to be my guest during your recent
visit to LaGrange. A
Our mutual friends, knowing of
my esteem for you, tendered me the
honor of introducing you, which com
pliment I gladly accepted, but later
was forced to forego this great pleas-
ure on account of a court subpoena
to appear as witness the day of your
coming. I afterwards managed to
delay my departure one train that I
might see you, and hear at least a
part of your magnificent address.
I would have you know, my dear
friend, that you have a place
in my affection, and the years only
add strength to the sincerity of my
attachment of all these years. “Once
upon a time” when the shadows fell
heavily upon me, I wrote to you
craving a .word of comfort. Your
reply came as a benediction, and
oftentimes now I read it and bless
you. Surely, to bring sunshine into
the life of a fellow being, “where
shadows dwell,” is a gift more to be
coveted than all the honors and the
plaudits of the multitule.
Believe me, to serve you in even
the. slightest way would be a privi
lege to me always. God bless you.
Faithfully your friend,
F. M. Ridley.
FROM A LITTLE NAMESAKE.
Forsyth, Ga., Nov. 15, 1998.
Dear Mr. Watson: The volume
which is made up of a story of your
life and a selection from many of
your great speeches was received
promptly, and I prize it above any
gift I have ever received, and I am
reading and studying the lessons
taught by it, and I know I will be a
better boy and a more useful man for
having learned from you.
It was like you not to think of ask
ing Mr. Stephens for a loan or aid
of any sort. And lam glad you did
not, for you have made your own
way alone, and papa says more peo
ple love and respect you than any
other man in the Union. And I be
lieve it. Papa says you had rather be -
right than to be President, and that
makes you greater than Bryan,
Roosevelt or Taft.
Our town gave you 172 votes. Papa
did all he could to make it go for
you, but could not.
I hope God will help the people to
understand you, and may you live to
see your principles become law. I
thank you so much for the splendid
book.
Tom Watson Hollis.
NOT DISCOURAGED.
Douglas, Ga., Nov. 16, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson. Thomson, Ga.
Dear Friend: I am not discour
aged. I think I know that we have
the majority of the common people
with us. I think I can see how it was
in the Presidential election here, and
it was about that way all over the
State. Bryan got 223, Taft 155, Wat
son 21, which made little over half
of the registered voters in this pre
cinct. I am satisfied that Taft got
100 that would have voted for you
if they thought it would do you any
good; they said it would be throw
ing away their vote. They did not
want Bryan, so they cast their vote
for Taft. Having no organization
we lost some. You getting tangly]"
up in the Governor’s race, some found
fault. Not I. I will be with you just
