THE BOYS IN GRAY
MUSICAL TRIUMPH OF MRS.
HOLLINGSWORTH-WATKINS.
"Three Centuries of American Ballads"
in Costume-Enterainment of Con
federate Veterans in New York.
The Caucasian is gratified to note that
Mrs. Hollingsworth-Watkins (Adah
Hollingsworth), who has resided in
New York city since she left her home
in Shreveport soon after her marriage,
is achieving flattering success and tri
umphs in her art. At the thirteenth an
nual banquet of the Confederate Vet
erans Camp of New York, given at the
Waldorf-Astoria. Mrs. Hollingsworth
Watkins arranged a program of songs,
divided into three parts, giving an illus
tration of three epochs of American
taste. The first part consisted of the
songs of Colonial Days-of ballads
which were brought from England by
the wives and daughters of the gentle
men who settled the Virginia and
Maryland plantations in the Seven
teenth and enighteenth ceutries. They
were sung to the lute, and later to the
harpsichord, and were a factor in the
creation of the farmers' social life of
that period of. American history.
The second part was made up of
"Songs of Ante-Bellum Days." The pe
riod between 183o and i86o has come
to be considered the romantic period of
American social life. Music was the
chief part of every woman s education,
for it was the time when it--was de
manded that she should be an enter
tainer. These are the ballads which
were sung to the guitar and the piano
from New Orleans to Boston.
The third, part of the program was
made up of selections from the songs by
favorite American composers iof today.
Referring to this entertainment, the
American Art Journal, a leading au
thority on musical art, says:
"The musical attraction at the dinner
of the Confederate Veteran Camp in
New York, at the Waldorf-Astoria on
January 26, proved to be the hondsome
and accomplishkd Louisiana, singer and
artiste, Mrs. Hollingsworth-Watkins,
with her sympathetic rendering of ante
bellum songs itat were familiar and
, ..si ieiaw=s "g : in. eatts e, each
and. every one was applauded to the
echo, and the audience sealed her tri
umph when She responded to a vocif
erous recall with the 'Suwanee River.'
"Commander Edward Owen, of the
New York Camp, acted as toastmaster.
On his right sat Mayor Low, next to
Ch.-rles Francis Adams. Others at the
gaests' table were Col. Watterson, Wil
liam Hepburn Russell, Ex-Chief Justice
of Tennessee D. L Snodgrass, General
Thomas H. Hubbard, Walter S. Logan,
eX-Jtstice Roger A. Pryor, ex-Justice
Augustus Van Wyck and General A.

tables there were: Dr. Simon Baruch,

Notwithstanding the Old Corefeds
were in the company of these dignita
ries, their' guests, of whom a number
woere the Blue, they were "Rebels" still
-ad could not restrain their manifesta
tion of enthusiasm, the, demonstration
of their loyalty to the South, their un
dying love for the Lost Cause.`

A WEEK'S ENGAGEMENT
The Peruchi-Beldeni Company at the
Opera House.
The Perichi-Beldeni Company, which
opens a week's engagement at the Grand
opera house Monday night, March 2, is
said to be the strongest popular price
company ever seen in the South. The
Knoxville Journal has t4h following to
say of this company:
"The Peruchi - Beldeni Company
played to a good house last night at
Stuab's theater, and presented 'Dangers
of New York.' The bill was an excel
lent one, and the applause which greet
ed its presentation was generous enough
to please even the most fastidious man
agement. Especially good in the line of
specialties was the cabinet trick of Lati
more and Leah. Herrman, the magician,
presented a similar specialty in Knox
ville a short time ago, which falls far
short of the exhibition which these
young.gentlemen give. Not only do the
Latimore and Leah combination invite
a committee on the stage to 'see that
everythiig is on the square, but they al
low the committee to remain on the
stage during the whole trick. The turn
is really the feature of the show."
In order to introduce this excellent
company one lady will be admitted free
Monday night with each paid 30c ticket
purchased lefore 6 p.m. opening day.
MISS CARRIE SAUNDERS.
Aftei abrief illness Miss Carrie Saun
ders died ,ather home on Market street
Friday .oo 4ocp . In this
great buis ulit g ,Id te eagerness
m sun~trs s conitent un theteptiful
valley,' with sweet violets from which
she could behold the pinnacles and the
glamour in the fullest realization of the
consciousness that whatever she did and
had to do was done as best she could
indeed, well done. If frail of body, her
mind was rich in all the traits and love
lmess which ennoble womankind, and
along her path she always spoke kindly
words, and her cheerfulness won her
friends everywhere. At an early age she
was an orphan, a-meaning which is fully
comprehensible to those only who have
experienced such a misfortune. At the
time of her demise she was connected
with the Elite, edited and published by
Mrs. Julia Rule,, who, with tearful eyes,
could speak only words of praise of her
untiring, faithful associate. And so has
a life ended, a life which was useful, a
life which has been iewarded with a
glorious immortality.
And those who attended the burial of
Miss Saunders in the old cemetery Sat
urday evening, and those who k-new her
when a little child, and then a girl and
then a maiden and then a young woman
who had met and faced the duties of
practical every day life, will not soon
forget Carrie Saunders, but in their
hearts there will linger sunbeams radiat
ing. from her invigorating cheriflness.
A DRIFT OF VIEW.
Said a well known gentleman a few
days since, referring to one who holds
an office of prominence in this commun
ity, not judge, however: "He's trying to
win favor with the Union men."
Now, this remark was somewhat
startling and led the Caucasian man to
reflection: Why should any man do any
act, especially one in public office, and
allege that his object is to win the favor
of any organization -Union, Woodmen,
Knights of Pythias, or any organized
body of men?
The remark simply indicates the drift
of view and of opinion entertained by
many. We believe there is time for every
thing and the consideration-of all things
in their proper places. Why should any
citizen do or suggest an act without
connecting his motive in a political
sense with any organization.
ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
The Retail Grocers Association held

U. S. SENATORS
THEIR ELECTION BY A DIRECT
VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.
The State Legislatures Have the Power
to Command the Senate-Some
Objections Discussed.
New York American, Feb. 21: The
"American" is urging upon the various
State Legislatures now in session the
expediency of passing a joint resolution
making application to Congress for the
calling of a Constitutional Convention
for the purpose of submitting to the
people an amendment providing for the
election of United States Senators by
direct vote.
When thirty legislatures have adopt
ed such a resolution the convention
must be called. Thus the obstructive
tactics of the Senate, which year after
year has stubbornlyy refused to concur
with the House in . submitting the
amendment, will be defeated.
There is no argumenit against this re
form that will bear examination.
The favorite objection is that, should
the people and not the legislatures elect
senators, the Senate would in some mys
terious way cease to represent the sov
ereignty of the states. f
It is evidently expected that this con
tention will be peculiarly effective with
Democrats, because of the party's his
torical position as the upholder of state
rights.
The objection is groundless. The
maanner in which aa~stors are or may
with the Senates -, tbit
place in our scheme of government. No
matter how senators are chosen, the
constitutional right of each State to
equality of representation in the chai
ber can not be impaired.
There is, therefore, no reason why
any Democrat, 'as a Democrat, should
be hostile to the change from election
by legislatures to election by the people.
On the contrary, the proposal is thor
oughly democratic, since it gives more
power to the people.
Neither wotld the change reduce the
dignity of the Senate. The notion that
law-makers who owe their seats to a
method of choice which implies that the
people are unfit for the duty of select
ing them are somehow more "dignified"
than public servants elected at the polls
by popular vote is utterly un-American,
because it is essentially aristocratic.
Carry the notion to its logical length,
and we should possess a hereditary Sen
a;:, supremely august for the reason
that the people had po hand in creat
ing it.
State rights Democrats and those Re
publicans whl believe in centralization
are at equal liberty to support the popu
lar election reform, since it has not a
shadow of bearing upon state rights or
centralization.
Neither is it in any sense a party
.uestion.
It is advocated by men of all parties
and fa'rored by an overwhelming ma
jority of the American people.
Why?
Because experience has demonstrated
that the plan of electing senators by the
legislatures is a failute, and worse that
a failure.
It has led to flagrant corruption.
It has deprived states for long period:
of representation in the Senate.
It has lowered the quality of legisla
tures by frequently making the election
of their members dependent not upon
fitness, but upon their willingnessg tc
vote for some particular candidate for
the Senate.
It has produced bad state government
by causing contests which have taken
the minds of legislators away from the
affairs of their states.
It has made the senatorial office less
the reward of merit than the prize of
ambitious and unscrupulous wealth.
It has enabled powerful corporations.
seeking to secure or retain unjust privi
leges, to send men to the Senate as rep
resentatives of their private interests
and not of the interest of the states.
Election of senators by direct vote
would, make the Senate what it oughf to
be-a ,body representing the people of
~C~~;~irL,~t7t..
portunities of predatory wealth to clothe
its servants with senatorial power and
dignity.
It would give us a free Senate. &b
which poor but able men could aspire.
in' place of a house of lords for the
trusts.
The "American" hopes to see many
legislatures within the next few weeks
join in this thoroughly American mnovt
ment. Twenty-nine states have already
declared for in general terms. There
is no reason why every one of them
should not put its approval in the form
of a demand for a Constitutional Con
vention.
The Senate has refused to grant the
petitions, coming from legislatures and
other sources. for the submission of the
desired amendment.
But the people can prevail in spite of
the obstructing Senate. The Constitu
tion provides a way.
Two-thirds of the State Legislatures
have but to make the demand for a Con
stitutional Convention, an dthe Senate
will have no choice but to yield obedi
ence.
Every patriotic man, regardless of
party, who holds a seat in any State
Legislature and believes that the people
are the safest repository of power, will
vote for a joint resolution instructing
Congress to give the citizens of the
states of the Union the right to say at
the polls how they want their senators
elected.
The time has come to rebuke the Sen
ate for its unrepublican conduct, and
push its insolently obstructive will aside.
WEATHER BULLETIN
The Cold, the Warm and the Storm
Waves Forecasted.
(Copyrighted i9o3 by W. T. Foster.)
St. Joseph, Mo., Feb. 28.-My last
bulletin gave forecasts of disturbance
to cross the continent March I to 6,
warm wave February 28 to March 4.
cool wave March 3 to 7. '
The next disturbance will reach the
Pacific coast about March 5,. cross west
of Rockies by close of 6, great central
valleys 7 to 9, eastern states to.
I expect temperature' of this disturb
ance to be moderate with no great ex
tremes and while heavy rains may fall
in a few localities the general rainfall
will be small in amount.
The general tendency of the tempera
ture during the first ten days of March
will be upward to a greater extent than
the season requires and while this con
tinues precipitation must be light.
Warn, wave will cross west of the
Rockies about March 5, great central
valleys 7, eastern states 8. Cool wave
will cross west of Rockies about March
8, great central valleys so, the eastern
states 12.
This cool wave will not be severe and
it will continue to the north not reach
ing the sout ern states.
March will be a cold month. Three
general cold waves reaching meridian
go not far from I, 2o and 30o, will bring
the average tempearture of the month
toward the winter end of the thermom
eter, although the warm waves that will
reach the great central valleys moving
eastward about 12, I8 and 23 will give
us some premonitions of the coming
spring tide.
Generally the precipitation of March
will be about or above normal, but
some sections will get a serious drouth
commencing in March and extending
through April.
I expert very cold weather about and
imrmediately following date of this bul
letin, but this cold spell will not re
main long.
Temperature of the week ending
March 9 will average below normal and
rainfall will not be great.
First days of March will be generally
cold with a rising temperature and a
cessation of precipitation. Not much
rain till after 12.
STREET FAIRS.
Some time in May a street fair under
the management of the Ehrlich Bros.
will be held for the benefit, in part, of
the Genevieve Orphanage, and at a later
date a stfeet fair will be held under the
auspices of the Trades Council. There
is room for all, and all are wished un
limited success.
