MUD SLUNG IN
SCHOOL ELECTION
(Continued from page 1)
•upporters of Mrs. Moore and Mrs.
Haagenson concentrated their polit
ical blows on the Rev. F. Halsey Am
brose, exalted Cyclops of Grand Forks
county and pastor of the First Pres
byterian church here. The anti-Klan
forces used invectives with startling
freedom and a recklessness born of
desperation. The Grand Forks Her
ald in its issue of April 20, under a
front page head reading: “Ambrose
Arraigned as Wrecker of Concord and
Preacher of Hatred,” reported bitter
denunciations of the Klan leader as
voiced by individuals having special
reasons for their expressions.
Mrs. McHaffie, quoting from the
above mentioned newspaper, said:
"We might be able to live in peace
In this town even with the Ku Klux
Klan here, but at long as F. Halsey
Ambrose stands at the head of that
organization and stirs up strife, peace
is impossible."
Dean Vernon P. Squires abused the
Klan leader of Grand Forks in unus
ually vituperative language. Accord
ing to The Herald, Mr. Squires said:
"The men and women of Grand Forks
can run their own affairs without the
dictation of this sacredotal, sacrile
gious cyclops, F. Halsey Ambrose,
who has brought the spirit of disun
ion and hatred into the life of the
city.
“It is for the men of the city to
rise up and defend these two women
Against the sacredotal sky-scrapper.
It is time for someone to rise up and
paint this sacredotal tale twister in
bis true colors, although I know he
will pour forth his invectives which
be reserves for those who oppose him,
Against me for doing so.”
Mrs. E. C. Haagenson, candidate
for school goard membership, made
statements that revealed a political
coach on the sidelines. The Herald
reports her as saying: “We want
peace, and we won r t get it if these
men who represent this organization
which preaches hatred and discord
Are sent to the school board. Remem
ber that.
“During the war when the boys left
for the battlefield did we ask wheth
er they were Protestants or Catho
lics? And when they were wound
ed on the battlefields did they ask
whether the nurses and doctors who
ministered to them were Catholics or
Protestants? No.
“This is not a political campaign
Any more than were those campaigns
for the Red Cross which we held dur
ing the war. It is a fight for the
good of the community, and no effort
must be lacking to bring about that
good by electing these two women to
the school board.” -
In its April 20 issue The Grand
Forks Herald offered for public con
sumption some buncombe. We here
quote the editorial as follows:
“The influence of the Ku Klux
Klan in Missouri has been similar to
Its influence wherever it has ap
peared. It has introduced dissension
And division into the community. In
the city of Carthage, Missouri, the in
jurious effects of this condition be
came so apparent that there was or
ganized the Carthage Anti-Klan asso
ciation. The president of that asso
ciation is Howard Gray, for many
years district judge in that district.
On the eve of the recent city election
there, Judge Gray, in the name of
his association, made a powerful ap
peal to the Klansmen of his city. His
Appeal is of such universaal applica
tion that its main paragraphs are re
produced as follows:
“ ‘Our progress in this community
depends primarily upon good fellow
ship, mutual understanding, confi
dence, tolerance toward one another
and united effort. But you are divid
ing us. You have introduced the ele
ment of suspicion in our Chamber of
Commerce, the one common organi
zation of the city. You are splitting
our lodges, our churches our politi
cal parties. If you don’t believe it,
behold strong Democrats and strong
Republicans forgetting their party
And joining in opposition to you.
You have invited this fight. You do
not bring peace, harmony, good un
derstanding and unity, but you bring
discord, distrust, suspicion and dis
union.
“‘ln the name of your church, if
? r ou have one; in the name of your
odge, if you belong to one; in the
name of your political partv and in
the name of our city, which cannot
prosper if divided against itself; in
the name of harmony, brotherhood,
and 100 per cent Americanism we ask
you to leave the Klan or unmask and
come forth like brave, honest and
fearless men for what you believe to
be right. We are with you in every
thing that means a better Carthage;
In every move for better law enforce-

masks and we are against the secrecy
in which you shroud yourselves. We
do not question your motives; we
think you mean well, but you are
trying to accomplish good things by

tives by ignoble processes.
“‘lt is never right to do wrong. It
cannot be right for you to deceive
your friends and neighbors about
your membership. An oath that binds
a man to tell a lie is a blasphemy
and a sacrilege.’ ”
The election returns speak louder
than anti-Klan outbursts and truly
indicate the feeling of the citizens of
Grand Forks. Evidently The Her
ald and the gang which it serves have
been completely repudiated and the
Rev. F. Halsey Ambrose exonerated
of vicious charges. Even after a con
clusive expression of the Grand Forks
citizens, The Herald continued its
abuse of Klansman Ambrose editori
ally in its effort to explain the mis
statements and deliberate vicious at
tacks. To wit, the following editori
al, which we take from the April 22
issue:
“With the largest vote ever polled
in the city, Messrs. Arhart and Stin
son have been elected members of
the school board by majorities so
large as to place the result beyond
any possible question.
“Both of these men are representa
tive business men against whose char
acter and competence The Herald
has at no time uttered a syllable.
Because of the personal fitness of the
two women candidates and of the fact
that the result of this election will
leave the school board without a wo
man member, The Herald regrets the
defeat of Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Haag
enson. Its regret is still greater be
cause of the circumstances under
which the Arhart-Stinson campaign
was launched, and the torrents of
slander and abuse which have been
poured out by F. Halsey Ambrose,
pastor of the First Presbyterian
church and head of the local Ku
Klux Klan, under whose direction the
campaign was conducted.
“The school election is over, but
Mr. Ambrose is still with us, flushed
with his conviction of success, bla
tant, bombastic, slanderous, and
blasphemous as ever. That condition
must be recognized and dealt with.
The situation has passed beyond the
possibility of silence or neutrality,
even if it be a disgusted neutrality.
It must be dealt with, no matter how
distasteful the task may be. The
Herald expects to deal with it as ef
fectively as it can, and to continue
its effort until the community is rid
of this monstrositv ”

were dressed in the regalia of the
order.
At the close of the address by the
state lecturer, in which the pur
poses of the Klan were outlined, the
invitation was extended to all white
native-born, Protestant, Gentile
Americans to join. Over 100 affili
ated with the organization.
A large fiery cross was erected on
the end of a steamboat dock extend
ing out into the lake, following the '
ceremony. The explosion of bombs
and the discharge of firearms attend
ed the burning of the Klan’s em
blem.
The Women of the Ku Klux Klan
are organizing rapidly in Clay and
Dickinson counties, ft is predicted
that they will have as strong an or
ganization as the men within a few
weeks’ time. Great enthusiasm has
so far been displayed by the women.
STAR'S ANTI-KLAN
NEWS STORY UNTRUE
(Continued from page 1)
vealed in connection with the case
in no way point to the Ku Klux
Klan as a party to the disappearance
of Alice. But then the story serves
the purpose of The Star, which has
always been unfair in its attitude
toward the Protestant organization.”
Hie Star of Malice
The Star, running true to form,
seemed willing to take rediculoos
suspicions as expressed by a frantic
and anxious parent and use same in
an effort to discredit the Klan. The
finding of the bodies of the two
children entirely clears the Protest
ant organization of the malicious
charges and emphatically reveals The
Star as apanderer of colored news
stories. The motive back of Hie
Star’s story is self-evident and just
goes to show how far a newspaper
will go when prejudice is given free
reign and permitted to follow the
star of malice. Here we have another
glaring example of the “truthful
ness” of the average daily newspaper
when offering ‘news” concerning the
Ku Klux Klan. The American pub-'
lie is getting sick and tired of news
paper methods such as employed by
The Star and other metropolitan
dailies. So frequently lies and dis
torted facts get into the pages of
the daily press as to make tne news
papers of this country dangerous and
of little worth to persons seeking in
formation.
is certain that The Star’s pres
ent editorial staff will be repudiated
by a large number of Minnesota peo
ple who want news and nothing but
news presented in a fair and clfan
way. It is easy to make charges ac
cusing the Klan of this crime and
that outrage, but somewhat harder
to substantiate the accusations. We
will wager dollars against doughnuts
that The Star will make no effort to
correct misstatements which it has
made from time to time concerning
the Klan.
The Minnesota Star is on finan
cial rocks and when the court called
for bids from buyers of newspapers
not a single one was forthcoming.
So perhaps The Star’s days are num
bered. Stockholders all over the
state will most likely take their loss
with a grin wondering concerning
the wherefore of the which.
CHESTER, PA.—Chester Klan, No.

two months that it has been necesr
sary to lease a larger meeting place.
The new building will include a so
cial room for Klansmen and one for
visitors and prospective candidates.
An auditorium will be used for open
meetings which will be held each
week day from 2 until 11.
