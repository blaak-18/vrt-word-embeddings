George Alfred T'ownseind portrays
Gouy Tilden, of New York, as fol
lows:
Conceive yourself in the presence of I
,boyishly-built, trim-limbed, small- c
l, man, probably not above 5 feet 7
t 8 inchesl', yet in perfect proportions.
lie is supple and quick in his move
h is feet and hands are ex
Pr a -e hlie has a round head, swel
ling behind tihe temjples to a rather
t, arkalle breadth, and his hair is a '
ft, umedium brown, cut short, while (
i's conmlexion is unusually fresh,
king the tints of the sun readily,
tind his cheeks and chin are round, a
'ad the blue eyes very full in the lids ti
ud brows, with soft, girlish eye- e.

,t 1Hebraic, ithsoot being either at
,harp or large. He has no beard; lie iy
tiks with hie salle of his mouth, yet
jith an agreeable intonation and dis- a
tinctnese, and his chin is rather im- ii
mobile and slightly voluptuous, and
his dress neat. He looks at his visi
tor while talking, but not with equal n
iatentne.s, being of a philosophic and
subjective stamp of man, so that hie
is oten led to wander off to the rela- i
tiess and the appointments of th
natter in hand. But lie never losseh
he thread of his discoure, and is of
tn. pertinent and sententious. He
~as broad range of acquaintance, P
teading and inference, is not suspi
i0us, and whlen started ilo a line (f
talk he exhausts the theme, enlight
uiong thie listener's mind without
cramming. One never leaves Tilden
with a confusion of ideas; but some
nren do not like instrnuction, and
these are apt to remark, after hearing
]lim talk, what the rural member f
parliament said after one of Macau- I
ly's instantaneous statements of his
tory, "My Lord ! I wish I knew any

31. II. Carver, Esq., of the en- J
terprrsing firm of Carver & Tay
lori, has just returned from New
Orlans, and is prepared to sup
ply the wants of trade, with new
styles, and fresh goods.
There is much complaint in re
lation to crops-particularly cot
ton, it being greatly injured by
rest. The estimated yield for this
parish will be much reduced in
consequence.
Gov. Beveredge of Illinois turned
theTraonklin and Williamson county
Ka-Klai cases over to the United
Stt aatherities, thereby acknowl
edg is inability to suppress the
oi-flwas. This is rather heavy on the
iand' of the "Winnebago braves,"
whbeti tysing but law and order is
apposed to prevail. And is pretty
hard on Republican (?) government in
that State. The best way to get rid
of such nuisances as Ku-Klux is first
to Wove their friends from office and
put in honest patristic, liberty loving
Democrats. Give us a government
"of the people, for the people and by
the people," as Lincoln used to call
it, and Ku-Klux will not-lare to show
their heads anywvhee.-l-atoa Rouge
Advocate.
There may he some persons who
have not heard of Henry Pend. If

S ni whh an anecdote taken from the
