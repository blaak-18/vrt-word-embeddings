5 Drops.
"It is not often that we cornm
mend in these columns anything of
a medicinal character, but the re
ports that we hear of the efficacy
of the rejmedyl called "5 DROPS,"
are so unusual that we cannot re
tist the inipulse to give it special
m-ntion in this issue. For the
disease.4 mentioned in the adver
tisement this remedy seems to have
jumped into popular favor with a
single bound, and its success is
deserved, for it has performed some
remarkable cures. "5 DROPS"
is manufactured by the SWAN
SON RHEUMATIC CURE CO.,
167 Dearborn St., Chicago, and
the company has the highest rep
utation for honesty in all business
transactions." - [Silver Knieht

'To The (old Buýg PIrealhers-
My D)ear Brethren: You're a lot
(f dti(es. I hope yVou ar :'ttia'
pIlenty of caicketn. Say. vtl 1.1i
lows look lawfully nice in voºr
lone tail coat; and shinev wlhite
shir:s. I hope you g, et all the
chicken you want. Say, you're
the best looking set of professio
al men there is up there on earth.
I know it, for I heard the women
say so. That's the reason they
tgive you so luch chicken. That's
all right, you know. you w:nt to
"stand in" with the womenl. By
the way I don't think I've ever
Ithanked you fellows fur the good
vyou (did in the last campaign in de
tfending a Soldl standard. I now
coiem racethe oplporttuity to do :co.
In fact I thin!- if it had not been
for your timely assistance us sound
monllCey mlllci would have been ,ie
feate, I. and we s foult have h'en
paid ti the s:unm kind of mou:ny
that !he poor ti'lsh is paid in. Be
sides that it would have raisec.l the
plrice of everything that labor
creates so that it would have cost
you fellows more to live, which
would have been the same as re
ducing your salary. Now, this
wouldn't be Scripture, for there is
no vrcord in tfhe itle of the sal:t
rv of Jesus e"er being reduced.
On the o icr hand there is an in
stance in the B:',l where God's
chosen people adopted the s':lgle
gold standard. It was when they
built the golden calf. True, when
Moses came down out o' the moun
tain where he had been talking to
God he broke tio dad gummed
calf all to pieces, but then, Moses
was ruad, and he broke the tables
of the law which God gave him
also. If I was you fellows I
wouldn't go too much on what Mo
ses did anyway. He was a sort of
"looney" old man and it took him
forty years to lead she people
through a little strip of woods,
and because he bragged too much
God wouldn't ict him cross o',(er
into the "promised Land." There
can't be any dloubt about the gold
standard being right, for the Jews
all want it, and so do I. We have
got the iuostof it, and notes enough
to get all the balance an(d more
too. Now whenever anybody
numps onto you felloýws about be
ing in favor of a gold standard
just ggt up on your hind legs and
tell them about the story of the
golden calf, and the brazen serpent
and you will paralyze them. I'm
going to try to invent somuthing
that will stop chicken cholera so
you fellows can have more chicken
to eat. Say, the beauty about this
gold standard business is not gene
rally understood. It makes mon
ey scarce and hard to get, It also
makes work scarce, for the fellows
who have the money are afraid to
put it out. This forces lots of peo
ple into idleness, andl you know
"an idle brain is the devil's work
shop." People have to eat. I
have had laws passed making it a
crime to beg. As a rule the peo
ple won't starve, so there is only
one alternative; for the men to
steal anti rob, and the women to
sell their virtue. So through the
gold standard they are driven right
into my trap. This makes more
sin, and the more sin there is the
better is the demand for preach
ers. The better the demand is
for preachers the higher their wa
ges. So you see the gold stand
ard not only pays me but it pays
you fellows also. If there was
plenty of money there would be
plenty of work and everything and
less sin, and some of you fellows
would have to quit preaching and
the balance of you preach for less
wages. So you see the best thing
for you fellows is scarce money,
plenty of sin, and good salaries,
with plenty of chicken. Now go
right along advocating the gold
standard and depend upon me to
aidyou all I can. The richest
men in your congregations all
want the gold standard and if you
don't preach to suit them, why off
comes your head-or your pay,
which is about the same thing. I
hope you will be blessed with plen
ty of chicken. Say, when you fel
lows get down here I'll1 show you
the finest fire in which to roast
chickens you ever saw-bring all
the chickens along with you you
can get hold of. Again thanking
you for your very valuable servi
ces to me I am as ever your friend,
STAN DEVL.
