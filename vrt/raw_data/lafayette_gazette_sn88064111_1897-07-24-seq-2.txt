9-*'s the second place, the press
of the northern part of the State,
especially t.hose from the late
drouth-stricken regionh Should not
be disposed to antagonize the sugar
and tice industries, because it
must not be forgotten that the bone
and sinew of the great -aid which
was tendered to the'tr tit their late
sad plight emanated from the sugar
and rice section of the State. We
do not recall these std events to
memory with , natiofte of reproach,
but simply to prove that out charge
of ingratitude is muaintained by
good and sound argument" .
We take the foregoing excerpt
from the Valley of the T'ehe ini the
course of an editorial lin Whleh it
accuses the 1orth Lortisigna 1fegs
of Ingratitude. $y the way, Brother
BegddaUd makes an able defence of
ktcEnery's past record as a Demo
crat and Â£afcludes by doubting the
saneness of he who denies his De
mocracy because he is a Protectiohfat
and even goes so far as to say that
both the Senator and Bob Brous
sard openly declared themselves
]'rotectionists *,before the election,
and hence did but their duty when
they voted for the Dingley bill. But
we wish to remonstrate with Bro.
Begnaud for the unjust criticism he
makes against the press of North
]Louisiana for the honest opinions
they entertain it regard to Senator
McEnery and his vore. To say the
least, Brother, you ate uncharit
able, if not ungrateftl. Iemember t
the biblical maxim, and that the t
truest Chsrity expects no reward. t
And we want to remind you that t
*hen the people of South Louisiana t
-ete so blessed as to be bble to
give a helping hand to their north-I
ern brethren, there was little of that I
protection on sugar and rice which a
yoft ae sto axious to get. We do s
hot wish to be hwrsh at al,- as one
of the highest form's of charity is to I
be so to the uncharitable, but c
you are not echoing the opinion t
of our people when you make the I
foregoing acctcsation.
The Tensas Gazette's suggestion
as to the relegating of misde
mteanors to the justices is a wise t
one. We believe, as he does, that
magistrates should have final juris
diction in all cases where the pun
is6meut s" tsot necesstarily death or
imprisonment at hard labor. $n
necessary labor, expense and time
would be saved by such a plan, and
we thinl tlhe organic law should be
changed concerning this matter by
the Constitutional Convention.
We have only one suggestion to
make and thia is to lay a qualification
on the justices,. as sometimes men,
not possessing the required intelli
gence and education for the ad
tinistration of justice, are elected !
to fill the position of magistrate; I
too many Shallows get to bet

The States says,. "henever a
bemoaeti begins to talk in an
effectionate way of the greatness' I
Snd goodness of Thomas ~eteterson,
it can be set down that he has de
signs on some office and is gently
teaching out for it." No*, con
iderinsg that the States has again
rnd again lauded and eulogized that
great statesman, and that its ideal
Democracy once thought of assum
ing the name of Jeffersonian Dede- I
oerats, we are certainly at a-loss to I
And the name of the patron of the
party. The States rmest vie* the
whole Democefatic' pPtrry Las a body
of office-seekers, judging from its 4
statemenrt. i

bdrt'a sweet memory, "empty1 airy

Rev. Dr. T. DeWitt T'lttage be
lieves the legal fratetfity is the
most broad-m'nded one, even more
so than the ministerial. T'he rev
erend gentleman should certainly
know whefeof he speaks, being so
closely in touch with the. orthodox
preacher. He said in a sermoni
several weeks -ago, "If I were on
trial for my integrity or my- life,
and wanted even-handed- justice
adtaihstefed, I would rather have
my case submitted to a jury of
twelve lawyers than to a jury of
tiwelve clergymen."
The St. Mary Optic says, "no
party can be called a white party
which depends sleI~ y for victory
upon the colored vote; and that no
white man should hold an office the
tenure of which depends entirely
upon the negro vote". That is cor
rect, Brother, but we go a little
further in this neck of the woods.
The adverbs "solely" and "'en
tirely" are too sweeping; here no i
white man should solicit the negro
vote at ally and the patty that re=
ceives is not called iDemocratic.
The gold Democrats whose votes
contributed so largely to the elec
tion of McKinley, are thoroughly
disgusted with the high rates of the
new tariff bill, and so -good an au
thority as Senator Caffery declares'
that in the future they will act not
with the Republicans a they did
in the last campaign, but will vote
for their own presidential candid
ate. Senator Caffery shows that if
all the gold Democrats had noted,
for Palmer and Blckner instead of
McKinley, as nine-tenths of them
did, Bryan would have been elected
to the presidency. During the
campaign the Republicans wel
conted the supipott of the gold Dem
ocrats who could not swallow the
Chicago platform, and the latter
were assured that in the event of
the election of McKin!ey a mod
eriate tariff bill woutd be enacted
and one so framed as to yield the
revenue needed by the governmenrt.
The Dingley bill now in conference
and the most outrageous ever
passed bye Congress, shows how ut
terly false were the promises of the
Repurblican leaders, and the gold
Democrats have just cadse fot the
indignation they toow express, arid
it is quite safe to say that the Re
r.ubHcans will not be able to de- I
ceice then again.--=Daily States.
The shooting of the befgrto
Girouard by another near lloyville
last Monday should be a warning to
those who have contracted the bad
habit of carrying concealed
weapons. This dangerous habit
has become too general and we
again urge upon the proper officials
to do their utmost towards check
ing it. sberiff Broussard and his
aids deserve credit for the stand
they have taken tryag to stop this
growing evil, to which so many
crimes and accidents can be traced.

Waiting fose fhe Wave.
A local muse, probably inspired
by low wages and hafd times, and
kept waiting for the "coming wave"
of prosperity, has given vent to his
inspiration in the following lines,
s which though perhaps not possess
- ing the sweetness of Moore's lyrics,
p the virility of Byroet's masterpieces
L or the inexpressible" charm of Ten
- nyson's poetical truths, yet contain
s a ring of the good tasen, 1ik'h orties
t to us when we hsave been fooled:
1 You told us that a billow of prospertty 1
e would flow,
A mighty wave across the land trom Maine
to Mexico;
That the mills would all be ap;ted .t*f
lost confidence restored,
F And the banks would loosen up their grips
atpon the golden hinatrd.
i We are trusting now the virtue odi fi goldenv
cure to save,
And are waiting, whitid ealay ~*ati'n for
the Wave.
You said the glorious flag of thrift at once
would be unfured,
r And wave again in gladness o'er a recon
f structed world;
That Hope's effulgent beams would shine
in floods of living light,
And raven-winged Despair would fIe her
everlasting flighb,
that these grand things would happen," you
your solemn promise gave,
And now we're waiting, waiting, calmly
waiting for the Wave
I Yes, all these things wouldl h~ppe*, we were
confidently told,
If we'd vote for Buckeye Billy and the
Single Standard Gold.
i But now we're on our uppVUr from tramping.
through the States;
In search of work to earn wherewith to buy
our bread and meat.
We voted as you said we should, in, hopes
the way to pave
To better. times, and now wce*re" sadly
waiting for the Wave.
We've been waiting, waiting patiently for
lo ! these many dayd,
I And watching for the rosy dawn to greet
t our anxious gaze,
Till our wardrobes are depleted, and our
rations running low,
And the interest on the mortgage due,. and
we are out of dough
5 But hope deferred will drivue at PYemnaturely
S to the grave,
If We have to wait nrh' fonger for the
coming of the VYae. J. T. A.
