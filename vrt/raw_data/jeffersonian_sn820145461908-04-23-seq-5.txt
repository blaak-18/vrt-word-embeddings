TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS.
The best all-round melon grown in Georgia.
It has every good quality of the famous Georgia
Rattlesnake, and is superior to that variety in
that it is almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is a much
better keeper. It is superior to the KLECK
LEY MELON in that it grows much larger,
and has all of the sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the market
for the past twenty-five years, and have tried
all of the varieties known in Georgia, and have
no hesitancy in saying that the TOM WATSON
melon comes nearer meeting every requirement
than any variety I ever saw. I consider the
seed to be worth their weight in gold.
