NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS.
All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a bid before
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the duty of all men to
support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
AN ABSURDITY.
The correspondent of the Timi
Democrat from Natchitoches says:
"The large majority of the Popu
list candidate is due to the negro
vote polled by them." We are not
surprised at our friend endeavoring
to hunt some consoling feature to
sooth his disappointed feelings
Sowing from the result of the elec
tion in this parish, but if he had
put himself to a little trouble and
consulted wiser counsel in his own
ranks he could have had the great
er consolation of being consistent
at least.
We will direct our friend to the
result of the election in the North
west and East, which reversed an
almost solid Democratic vote in
1899 to an ahnoet solid Republican
vote in 1894. He will ind that
when the Populist were strongest
the Democrats were advised to and
did vte the Republican ticket ad
e-se +rs. This establisbhes the
faet that we have been eontending
for, and also the Picayune, a Demo
aratin paper, has admitted that the
old peties were eontending for the
.apremey ot the classes sad that
the Populist. were contending for
hs rights of the maes, which
muma that the old parties have oa
ly oe ad both of them the ame
object ia view. It further abowm
that the money power has no
shae. as to whichot them suceeds,
th remalt is the sme, hence this
nited tght against the Popunlist.,
the party that epresats the mas
-e. Thoeads of Democrats who
were justly disgusted with he
Dtiemoses puIty, were indued to
vote the Republiesa ticket fa order
t deekr t the Ppulis . It is only
b*age of "Als" that wiloon

with great delight. It is a fact
well known to the correspondent
that the negro in Natchitosbes par
ish did not vote to any extent, it
being estimated by many Demo
crat, that not more than one hun
dred voted and many of them vot
ed the Democratic ticket. We
suppose our friend can seek fur
ther consolation in the fact that
Bossier parish, that has ten negro
votes to one white vote, came to
the relief of the Democrats in
maintaining white supremacy with
25(1) majority negro votes. How
is this ?
All the hill parishes where the
white people are in the majority,
the Populists polled big majorities,
but in the river parishes where the
negroes were in the majority the
Democrats succeeded in maintain
ing white supremacy (1) with the
negro votes. This was done in all
parishes except Natchitoches, and
in this parish we had a fair eloc
tion. The parish of Lincoln,
which is a white parish, went Pop
ulist, but the Democrats of the
Fifth district congratulate them
selves on the fact that Tensas and
Ouachita with their big negro ma
jorities came to their aid in main
taining white supremacy (1). Now
don't you know that the negro is
an indispensable attachment to
Murphy's election machinery, and
when the machinery is used it
never grinds out anything but
Democratic votes (?) and it does
this whether the negro goes to the
polls or not, or whether he is dead
or alive with the machine at work
he is ever faithful in his efforts to
maintain white supremacy (?).
The negro with slight exceptions
did not go to the polls in this par
ish, and the machine (owing to the
honesty of the election officers) was
not permitted to run on that day,
and they of course could not be
counted as usual for white suprem
acy. This is the only solution of
the question why Natchitoches went
Populist.
It also solves the question of big
majorities for Ogden in the negro
parishes. But we thank God
that we can at least hope that the
time is near when it will be con
sidered treason for the chief execu
tive of a great State to stand upon
the rostrum and announce to the
public that his efforts will be used
to perpetuate a system of fraud
and ballot box stuffing to defraud
the people of this great nation in
the interest of rings and robbery.
Every honest man in the land
ought to say amen to this.
Coming Home to Roost.
A few months ago when the peo
pie of Illinois were being shot
down by Federal troops, the Times
Democrat was all aglow to show
that the government was justified
in tearing down State lines and in
vading a sovereign State with Fed
erl troope.
A few days since a local disturb
ance occurred in New Orleans be
tween the white and colored srew
men on the levee, whereupon the
Pacific Steamship Company, a
great organisation following in the
steps of the railroad company, ap
plied to the Federal court for an
injunction preparatory to calling
on Federal troops, following in
identically the uame steps of the
railroad. In regard to this the
Times-Democrat of 9th inst., has
this to say :
"We cannot underatand the ne
eessity for appealing to the Federal
eaurt until every other recourse
had failed. Louiian has a Gov
ernor, and it so ippens that he
was prasLt in the e yesterday.
The Govetro should vs been ap
peald to lor mis. and proteo

have been his plain duty to have

Like Gonumr &kgeMl, at Ill
ask GOeenaor Jtr had hem up
pmMd ta ed Iamisd eishma
aid. but these corporations having
got a taste of Anmericai blood by
appealing to an imbecile President
could not forego their greedy de
sire for more blood. This instance
will convince all thinking people of
the fact that these powerful cor
porations will call for the Federal
bayonet upon every pretext, it
matters not how slight.
It is not our intention in this ar
ticle to discuss the scope of con
stitutional or statutory authority
for using Federal power in cases
of insurrection, but we have and
will ever denounce the precedent
of Grover Cleveland in sending
troops into Illinois, as being the
downfall of personal rights in the
United States. The T-D., should
have had the couragv to denounce
it as a dangerous precedent and
one that may yet end in a bloody
revolution.
The Election.
Hlon. B. W. Bailey has been
elected by an overwhelming ma
jority when the frauds are sifted
out and the true vote ascertained.
The vote in Red River parish:
Bailey. Ogden.
Ward 1 56 193
" 2 46 78
" 3 106 41
" 4 5 208
" 5 29 204
241 724
In this parish the grossest frauds
were perpetrated, the People's par
ty commissioners were debarred
from serving. Intimidation of ne
groes who were marched up to the
polls and voted for the Democrats
under threats and by intimidation;
poll books tampered with; we have
evidence from responsible men to
this fact and in a just investigation
it will be no trouble to establish
them.
The People to be Again Robbed
for the Banker.
The National banks are deter
mined to have the last drop of
blood, though the nation perish.
The smoke of the great battle of
ballots of the 6th inst. has scarce
ly cleared away when the tool of
national banks, (Grover Cleveland)
has ordered that $50,000,000 more
bonds be issued, and this too with
hundreds of millions of dollars in
gold and silver bullion lying in the
vaults of the United States treasu
ry that could be coined and not
cost the people a cent. But you
see this would not give the banker
the 5 per cent interest, neither
would it give them the bonds as a
basis for bank notes. The people
may be starting and freezing, but
they must still contribute to the
banker with cotton at 4 cents a
pound, and wheat at 35 cents ler
bushel. This issue of bonds with
the other issue that rhas already
been made by Cleveland's adminis
tration, will bring the bankers just
five million dollars interest annu
ally in gold, and will consume the
labor of 5000 men for 1000 days
or three y-ears and four months, at
one dollar per day, or if paid in
cotton it will require 250,000 bakes,
or if in wheat, it will require 14,
285,714 bushels. Mr. Carlisle de
murred, but Cleveland told him the
bonds must be isned before the
Congress meets in December, to
interfere by opposing legislation.
How can the sufering people of
this country view the aituation
calmly when their votes are count
ed fraudulently to maintain this
horde of robbers in oficel
The poor democrats, dazd and
dumbfounded, tried to get comfort
out of the election returns by
claiming that the populists had
also met a Waterloo. But even
this crumb of comfort is denied
them, as the later returns show
substantial gains for the populist.
-Wool Hat.
It is indeed a strange coincidence
tom ay the lest, that an English
man-of-war hoMd leave her moor
iangs and move up md station her
mMt h front ef the soene of I im
mureetioen in New Orims. Of
morse the plutocratici pres mays
ther i- no sipi anoa in the -fEet,
but to msay the lieat of it, it is
wmthyof ci t
Foster's Reform Ballot Law.
It works well at 'lieneyville
and many other places in the 4th
district. Fr;um reliable aunthority
we le.anr that the white vote of
Cheleyville is about 160 and not
more than half went to the elec
tion. The only negro that voted
was a 16 year old boy who chanced
to pass near the poll and was forced
by a drunken commissioner to come
in and vote. The returns show
416 votes, S of which were for
Bailey.
There was only one commis.sion
er sober, and even the maishal or
deputy sheriff was drunk. One of
the tally sheets was pinned to an
other person's coat tail anul para
ded over town for quite awhile, but
the normal majority of even 400
went up to Alexandria all right.
Glorious D)emocracy ! Not a sin
gle State carried except by such
methods.
We now nudeistand what R. II.
Snyder of Tensas, meant when he
said, in the session of our State
Legislature, speaking of the bill
enacting the present election law,
that the bill was in the interest of
the Democratic party, and no good
Democrat could afford to vote
against it.
Many other boxes were conduct
ed about like Cheneyville, and
more light, and probably some
thing else will be thrown upon
them in the near future.
Negroes Voting the Democratic
Ticket.
The Town Talk was gratified to see
so many colored men walking up to the
polls on Tuesday and casting their votes
for the Democratic gominee. Some years
ago a colored man who voted the Dem
ocratic ticket was a curiosity, but of late
years they have learned that the Demo
crats are their true friends-the friends
they can depend on when in need of
help.
Is this the miserable excuse for
3000 votes piled up at less than
half the precincts in Rapides. If
so, tell us why that "curiosity"
doesn't exist at Red Store, Tram
way, Poland, Pineville, and other
river precincts. Tell us too, how
876 votes could be legally polled
at one box in 20 minutes-yes, the
bulk of them in 360 minutes. Tell
us also why the vote was so much
heavier at most of the precincts
carried by Mr. Ogden than at
those carried by Mr. Bailey-why
so much enthusiasm in Alexandria,
and so little just across the river
in Pineville, so much at Lecompte
and none just 8 miles out on the
river front at Poland, so much at
Lamourie, and none at Tramway,
so much at Boyce and none at
Lena, so much at Weil's and none
at Red Store. Was it because
these enthusiastic precincts were on
or near the railroad lines and got a
telegram about 12 o'clock to open
the "throttle valves" or Ogden
was gone, "world without end I"
Tell us all these easy little rid
dles, dear Town Talk, and then re
sume your former hypocrital twad
dle about "ballot reform," "white
supremacy" and "general and need
ed relief."
Natchitoches, a heretofore Demoerati e
stronghold, leads in the Populist column.
Just what inluences have exerted sueh
a eurprising revolutkon it Is difBealt to
determine. The heretofore invincible
leaden seem to have either abandoned
the fight or stayed at home. rhe only
wards that polled a majority for Ogden
were Natehitoches, by 25 majority, ~rle
en, l) majority, and Nine, 32. Mayhap
the resualt will beregretted by Democrats
who failed to do their whole dau.
Bhreveport Time.
We have never seen a more eon
tented looking set of people than
the Democratrs of Natchitoches.
They have nothing to regret. No
perjured consciences; no stolen
majorities to try to account for; mno
miserable subterfuges like "negro
Democrate," etc.; .no outraged fel
low-citizens seeking revenge; no
dire forebodings that "those who
live by the sword shall die by the
sword."
Truly, the Natchitoches Demo
crat must be a happy mortal com
pared to some of his so-called
brethren.
The Alabama rebrmers have
-aally become ashamed of the Jet

cognomen, aind disarded it, joiln

Carolina reformers should make a
note of this and do likewise, alsne

Madam Rumor Says :
That some of Her friends think
S1"e wasted ammunition last week,
as it is difficult to flavor an old
swill tub.
That ballot box frands will be
stopped whenever the so-called
honest people want it to, and no
sooner.
That it is certainly a great ccm
mendation on the intelligent peo
pie of Louisiana, that so little res
pect and cotnsideration is paid to
the sancity of the ballot.
That the sugarcrat Republicans
refused to go into a white primary
with the Democrats for the same
reason that the Fourth district
Democrats declined the Populists'
proposition; they wanted to use
the negro.
That white supremacy perpetua
ted by fraudulently casting negro
votes, is the way we do things in
Louisiana.
That if the people want Her to
stop talking out in meetings, let
them put an end to those election
frauds.
That She propounds this query
to the ministers of Louisiana;
Which is worse, going to circuses
and theaters or stuffing the ballot
boxes T
That one lone and lonesome coiw
missioner was holding down the
Market street box at one time du
ring the day, Tuesday.
That any man who is very deci
ded in his views of right and
wrong, and favors honesty in elec
tions, is dubbed a crank by the
political bosses and the collar wear
ers yelp out "quank."
That if our ministers woukl say
something about their members
tuffing ballot boxes and indorsing
this crime by others, instead of
coonfning all their denunciations
against those who attend thea
ters, balls, progressive euchre par
ties and the like, they would be
much more consistent.
That She hopes pot-house poli
tics has been strangled in Shreve
port, though it figured quite ex
tensively in the two last Congres
sional campaigns.
That She has never made war on
the saloon keeper for conducting
his business because he pays li
cease to do so, but She does make
vigorous war on his attempt to
control politics, to subvert our
laws.-Shreveport Progress.
The "pop" lost Colorado, their
stronghold, nor did they elect a
single Congressman from the State.
They were snowed under in Kan
sas too.-Morehouse Clarion.
The Republicans have swept Kan
sas the populist stronghold, and
will have complete control of the
State, and elect a United States
Senator, the Legislature having
gone republican.-Morehouse Clar
ion.
Neither of the above assertions
is true, but from the way the Clar
ion jubilates over Republican suc
ces one would think it a "black"
Republican sheet. Such would be
the verdict against this paper if it
said as much about the Republican
victories in Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia, Tennessee, Texas,
and the balance of the United
States.
The Eoetion in the Fourth.
The returns show the election of
Mr. Ogden by a big majority; but
if the honest people of the district
can stand such outrageous carry
ing on, surely Mr. Bailey can.
We shall give the vote by par
isbes next week and have some
thing tarther to say on the sub
ject.-Shreveport Progress.
B. W. Bailey; wherei he, p a
pine tree --Shreveport Caucasian.
Yes, and some things happened
on election day, (or night rather)
that look queer "to a man up a
tree."
Now that the election is over and
the machine has got inits usual
work with the full connivance and
approval of the esteemed States,
Times-Democrat and Picayane, we
shall condently expect them to re
sume the disousion of the burning
issue of "honest ballot reform"
which they so ably and ardently
conducted up to the time the late
-mp ignopened in real earnest.

Texas Gone Populist.
Pperial to ehe Tilnes-l)emocrat.
ABsIJ.NE, NOv. 8.--Texfa, too,
was caught in the landslide, ,but by
Populists instead of Republicans.
The time-worn plurality of 180,0U0
for D)emocracy is a thing of the
past. To-day's returns very mate
rially change the situation from
that of yesterday. Yiesterday the
Democrats were confident of a
plurality of 80,000, while to night
they will be satisfied if barely
elected. Every return throughout
the State received to-day shows
phenomenal Populist gains, and
may possibly indicate the election
of Nugent, the Populist nominee
for Governor. The State is to
night claimed by both parties.
The Populists claim a plurality of
80,000 for Nugent, while the Demo
crats only claim the State for Cul
berson by 30,001. The Democratic
strongholds have been heard from,
while the Populists are yet to re.
ceive returns from the country
precincts.
Texas may possibly lose elevein
out of thirteen Congressmen, as
the following will show: In the
second district Cooper (Dem.) oly
leads Calhoun (Pop.) 1927 votes,
with the largest Populist vote to
come in. In the third district Yoa
kum (Dem.) has 12,568 and Par.
due (Pop.) 10,479, with heaviest
Populist vote to come in. In the
fourth district Calbersou (Dem.)
leads Dorcas (Pop.) by a small ma
jority, and heaviest Populist vote
yet to be heard from. In the sixth
district the election of Kearby
(Pop.) over Abbott (Dean.) is con
ceded. In the seventh district
Pendleton (Dem.) is only ahead of
Barber (Pep.) 411 votes, with hea
vy vote for Barber yet to come in.
In the eighth district the election
of Jenkins (Pop.) over Bell (Dem)
is conceded. In the ninth district

defeated Cockrell and Dean (Dem.)
by a large plurality.

W-e-ll, y-e-s. Seems to have
spoken on the 6th. Populists may
be "deluded" but that's little worse
than deluged.
Hon. B. W. Bailey carried every
whito perish in the Fourth Con
gressional District, but the "des

maintain white supremacy. It is
the same way all over the South,
whether the negroes are dead or
alive, he votes the Democratic
ticket solidly. Can you tell us
why 1
On Monday evening the Texas
& Pacifie wharf just opposite New
Orleans, containing over twenty
Ave thousand bales of cotton was
entirely consumed by Aire; sup
posed to be of incendiary origin,
and several suspects have been ar
rested.
This has nothing to do with the
price of the fleecy staple, prices
continue to go down daily. Just
here let us mildly ask why the
Naew Orreans papers coutinue to
quote middling at fe., when com
mission merchants and cotton bro
kerns unite that it is selling under
the quottilons. Are they afraid to
tell us the actual price, or is it
simply an oversight?
"We knew you would kick," i.
the cry some of our good-natured
democratic friends give us. That's
right. Let's kick and kick high;
high enough to reach Mr. Ogden
