RELE \SEI) FROM JAIL.
tucsde~v r:fterncw n MtIrs. Josephine
Loggins Bullock's was releasced from the
narish tail, where she had been confined
int.e Saturday night on the charge of
poisoning her husband. The coroner's
verdict .murder, was reached on the
statement of Mrs. Bullock. The district
attorney, after consulting with Judge
Land, ordered the release as there was
not sufficient evidence to convict her.
The further investigation into this case
will be conducted by the grand jury.
While in custody Mrs. Bullock was com
fortably situated and had all the con
veniences which could be given her.
When liberated she was overjoyed, as
were her children who had been waiting
patiently for her coming.
IN SELF-DEFENSE.
S. S. McCarver, the saloon man who
shot and killed Bird Tracey in the Re
ginia saloon on Texas avenue, corner ot
Lawrence, on June 19, 1902, was ac
quitted Tuesday afternoon by the jury
which tried the case. The plea of self
defense was sustained. It was in evi
dence that Tracey was not armed, but
when shot lie was attempting to crawl
over the bar for the purpose of disarm
ing McCarver and killing him as he had
threatened. It is said that Tracey was a
"bad man" from "Bitter Creek." It was
also in evidence that the night or even
ing preceding the homicide that Tracey
had ran out McCarver from his own
saloon with a pistol and threatened to
kill him. Bird Tracey is also associated
with Tracey, the man man of Oregon,
who suicided to escape arrest.

PATROL TRAIN GONE.
The Mississippi Valley Railway Comrn

Pelican State Metropolis
to Baton Rouge.
New Orleans, March 1S.-The river
here continued stationary yesterday.
The morning reading was 19.2 feet,
from which there has been practically
no variation since Saturday last. The
weather is clear. City embankments
are constantly being improved and a
thorough inspection of the front from
Southport to the barracks shows no
points of danger. News of the breaks
of the levee above St. Francis and at
Bougere caused some disappcintment,
since the effect is likely to be a pro
longation of the period of high water
here. People who returned from the
break below Pointe a la Hache say the
break there is of little consequence.
The country is barren and no serious
damage will be done.
The Mississippi Valley road started
out a patrol train which ran between
Baton Rouge and New Orleans. There
is a magnificent stretch of levee be
tween these two points, which protects
some of the most valuable sugar plan
tations in the state. Every effort is
being made to hold it, and men and
material have been distributed along
it in abundance.

Hundreds of Memphis People Have Had
to Vacate Their Homes.
AMemphis, March 18.-The river is
slowly falling here, the gauge register
ing 39.4 feet, against 39.7 Monday
night. The break In the levee pear
,Hollybush, twenty miles north of here,
is responsible for the fall at Memphis.
The crevasse is three-quarters of a
mile wide and the water is rushing
through with a roar that can be heard
for miles. The whole of St. Francis
basin will be flooded and incalculable
damage done. No other breaks have
been reported, but several weak spots
are being watched by engineers. At
Memphis the flood situation is growiig
more serious. In the northern part of
the city hundreds of families have left
their homes for high ground and every
Industry is shut down. Street car ar
vice has been abandoned. In South
Memphis the water is threatening all
railroad tcaks and hundreds of labor
