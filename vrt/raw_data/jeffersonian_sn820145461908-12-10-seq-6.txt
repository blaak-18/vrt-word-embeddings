RITING of the work of
the (Society for the Pro

material into some finished product
worth many times that much. Such
knowledge is of tremendous value to
the individual, and should be, under
wise laws, of equal benefit to the
race. Yet history is replete with in
stances where the inventor of price
less processes and wonderful ma
chines has remained poor, while the
reward of his brain and skill has been
reaped by capital; and humanity in
general, instead of enjoying easier
hours and less arduous toil by reason
of the manifold labor-saving patents,
has remained about as much enslaved,
industrially, as ever it was, even in
the old, crude days of serfdom.
Something more, then, is required in
the education of our youth. The
“classical course” in high schools
and other institutions of learning has
waned in popularity, because it fail
ed to enable a man undergoing it to
take care of himself in the battle of
life with other men. For that life
must be a “battle” we have always
been taught, and in our turn have
preached. Notwithstanding the earth
yields her harvests abundantly; and
despite the constant substitution of
machine for hand labor, we are still
driven by the lash of inexorable ne
cessity to toil from daylight to dark,
and count ourselves happy if we only
be permitted to hang on to the shred
of a “job.” So, classical instruction
alone has not done much for modern
youth, aside from training his mem
ory. His history has been a succes
sion of gory combats, and conspicuous
military leaders. He has not learned,
speaking of the average student,
one thing of value as to the
civil life of the people; he is unable
to see in any modern condition a
replica of any of the past. His politi
cal economy would best be character
ized by the word “weird.” He
emerges from school as a man in
years and strength, but a child in
respect to independent reasoning.
What the average boy needs to learn
is just exactly what the average man
does not yet know —not how best to
make a living, but how to prevent a
greedy, conscienceless system of class
legislation from taking from him the
living he does make. With the more
practical education in the arts better
fit the boy for life than the impracti
cal, superficial, co-called classical
education which, after all, can be en
joyed by comparatively few, while
the many leave school early, educated
in no sense of the word—merely re
moved from illiteracy by some ink
ling of the three R’s? In many re
spects it will meet the need of prep
aration for life more adequately than
does the schooling which employs
books alone, provided always it does

not tend to make a mere machine out
of each piece of human material sub
mitted, but any education which does
not teach the individual to think for
himself is a failure. He who cannot
reason anything out unaided is for
ever dependent upon what he reads
and absorbs from others, and he will
always be found accepting current
errors as truth, always be blinded by
glittering sophistries and, since he
must forever be a mere follower, he
will as naturally gravitate to the “big
side” as water will run down hill.
Like the slave he will not think shame
of his slavery, but will take pride in
being one of the largest number of
slaves in a great collection, and the
pomp and show his master is able to
boast will be his delight. The “aver
age man” is not on the wrong side
from viciousness, but from the ina
bility to discern the true from the
The Prisoners.
That which we were forever stands between
Ourselves and that we would be. With frail hands,
Cold upon either’s wrist an old year stands
And holds us prisoners for what has been;
And pitiful her eyes that needs must screen
Our restless eyes that turn toward unseen lands
And strange new days, and all the heart’s demands
Falter and fail before her wistful mien.
Surely we need but little strength to break
This feeble hold and turn and wander free,
Each one his separate way beyond her door;
Strange that we stand here sullenly for sake
Os that brief joy she gave to you and me
Ere love went weeping to return no more.

But, while the education of the
boy may well engage the most serious
thought of the age, ib is of no greater
importance than is the education of
the girl. If the spread of technical
knowledge and skill is a good thing—
and it is a good thing, although not
the panacea for all ills that many
judge it to be—thqn why should it be
confined to one sex?
The path to learning is nowhere
very easy for the children of the poor.
It is particularly thorny for the girl.
In Georgia, the State Technological
School has been relentlessly closed to
women. Yet women work in many
of the arts therein taught, and if one
girl may spend her time at spindle
and loom, why may not another girl
learn something of fabric-making
from a scientific standpoint? Better
still, why not give the girl-operative
of the factory a chance to learn some
thing more than the dreary mechani
cal part of the process? Why the gen
eral apathetic assumption that the
woman worker can have no interest
in the .work itself —that she must for
ever toil in some subordinate, mean
capacity?
Nearly all the large cities now pro
vide bight schools, where men and
15b* Jeffersonian
boys may brush up on the rudiments
without loss of time from the day’s
employment. Nothing of the sort is
available for the ambitious girl of
the shop and store. Again the loose
assumption of society that the girl is
an unnatural creature if she isn’t
content to “stay at home.” Why do
we always picture sweet sixteen as
recipient of parental adoration, en
sconced in the daintiest of boudoirs
and the object of the tenderest, most
satisfying care? There are hundreds
—thousands —of girls whose hearts
are hungry, whose minds are starv
ing; who know no privacy from the
tumblings and yellings of a swarm of
younger brothers and sisters; whose
surroundings are of the most squalid;
whose parents are actuated by mo
tives of the most sordid. What won
der that sheer disgust and loneliness
and desire for something different,
something brighter, should drive
many a young girl to a coarse fri
volity, if nothing worse?
No, in advancing the cause of edu
cation, classical, scientific, industrial,
or otherwise, let us consider all, not
merely a part, of the children. It is a
mistake to let a boy grow up unfitted
for the responsibilities he must meet;
but it is a crime against the individ
ual and against society to let the tal
ents of the girl go to waste —com-
mitting her ruthlessly to the alterna
tives of “being supported” by some
body else, or wrecking her life itself
in her effort to make a living in the
ranks of ignorant, unskilled labor.
Now that Christmas is close at
hand, the following* suggestions clip
ped from the Wrightsville (Ga.)
Chronicle, may be helpful to the wo
man or girl who has time and taste
enought to make some inexpensive
home gifts:
A fine linen handkerchief, with the
recipient’s name in script outlined in
one corner. A set of five crisp little
ready-tied bows, in various colors, to
wear with stiff linen collars. A chaf
ing-dish apron of flowered organdy
or dimity, with a ruffle edged with
narrow lace.
A roller on which to wind a veil.
This is made of a piece of curtain
pole eighteen inches long, padded
with a thin layer of sheet cotton, and
covered with a wide ribbon. The rib
bon is cut long enough to be drawn
into a rosette at either end and tied
with No. 1 ribbon.
A five-cent wooden coat-hanger
covered with ribbon. A yard and a
half of ribbon three and a half inches
wide, with three yards of baby rib
bon for the ends, will be needed.
A combing cape made of four ten
cent handkerchiefs. These are sewed
together in a square, and one of them
split in half diagonally. The corners
are turned back three inches at the
center of the square to form the neck.
The edges are bound with tape.
Fifty cents will buy a piece of
brass, either a pair of candlesticks
four inches tall, a bowl four inches
across, a card tray eight by four and
a half inches, a box for pens and
stamps, or a tray in round or oval
shape.
A telephone list is made of a sheet
of card-board or bristolboard, twelve
inches long and eight inches wide. At
the left-hand edge are lettered the
names of calls likely to be used —the
doctor, the grocer, the butcher, the
office, etc. Tapes fastened with
thumb-tacks cross the board from top
to bottom and hold small cards on
which the telephone numbers are to
be written. A more elaborate tele
phone list, also linen-covered, has
nothing lettered on it, but has a dou
ble row of oblong openings, with
cards for the numbers and names be
neath.
SONG.
When that I loved a maiden
My heaven was in her eyes,
And when they bent above me
I knew no deeper skies;
But when her heart forsook me,
My spirit broke its bars,
For grief beyond the sunset
And love beyond the stars.
When that I loved a maiden
She seemed the world to me;
Now is my soul the universe,
My dreams —the sky and sea!
There is no heaven above me,
No glory binds nor bars
My grief beyond the sunset,
My love beyond the stars.
When that I loved a maiden
I worshipped where she trod;
But when she clove my heart, the
cleft
Set free the imprisoned god;
Then was I king of all the world,
My soul had burst its bars,
For grief beyond the sunset
And love beyond the stars.
