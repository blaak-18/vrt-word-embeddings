s THE GREAT NAPOLEON.
tad Ills Remarkable Coolness to Times of
.ireat Danger. I
Maj. Gen. Yakovitch. of the Russian
army, Is one of the' few men now
living who saw ti great Napoleon a
on a battle field. The old soldier
saw the French emperor at iloro
dino. At that battle, Yalrovitch,
then a mere boy, served with a battery
in the grand redoubt, which was the
center of the Russian line. lie gives a I
graphic description of the battle.
When morning broke a sea of gray
mist shut out the field from view. The
voices of the enemy were heard, the
neighing of their horses, and the rum- h
bling of artillery wheels. Then came n
the thunder of cannon, making the ti
very earth tremble. Three times all
the Russian gunners were killed, and g
three times new men took their places.
Bullets flew thick as hail, and men a:
dropped dead or wounded every mo
ment.
At last a strange sound was heard in
the distance, like rain pattering on n
a withered leaves. It grew louder and ei
sd louder, until it filled the air like b
i the roar of a stormy sea. All
a- at once a great wave of bright r

came surging up over the breastworks.
It wan the imperial guardL. Before the bit
shock of that mighty wave the Rus
sian center crumbled away, shattered
wrecks.
When Yakovitch came to his senses Li
and opened his eyes, he heard the
trampling of hoofs, which called his at
tention to a group of gayly dressed of-f
cers, and Napoleon's staff came riding di(
over the field. The young Russian 1
peered anxiously into their faces, and Ve
thus describes what he saw: res
"There were the hard faces of Rapp
and Darn and broad-chested Sebastian
and Nansouth, with the saber scar
across his cheek, and the low, broad
forehead and bulldog jaw of grim old
Ney, the bravest of them alL There,
,too, was Murat, with his white plumes
and his braided jacket, his riding whip
in his hand, just like a circus rider.
"And then the group parted sudden
ly, and there was the man himself in
the midst of them, with his face hard
and immovable as marble amid all that
blood and agony, and a far-away look
in those cold gray eyes of his, as if he
saw Moscow somewhere up in the sky,
but could see nothing between.
" 'A glorious victor.y' cried Murat,
waving his hand. 'WVhat a stir there'll
be among the good folks in P'aris when
the bulletin arrivesl'
"'~'e'vec lost half our army in doing
It. though,' growled Ney. 'iadn't we
better fall back a little and wait there
for reinforcements?'
"Then- Napoleon turned his head d
slowly, just as the statue might do, and firs
looked him in the face.

you can't make an omelette without

Yakovitch says when he heard that EnF
he knew that fortune had forsaken
Napoleon, for no man save one doomed fror
to destruction could have spoken so mar
lightly of the slaughter of thousands of "4
brave men. In three months from that bec

If You Want The Best
ALTHOUGH you may have had good luck
with but few failures in making cake and
biscuit in the old-fashioned way with soda and
sour milk, or soda and cream of tartar, you
will have better luck and (following.directions)
no failures with the Royal Baking Powder.
The truth of this must be evident when you
remember that in the leading hotels and res
taurants, and in the homes of our city cousins,
where the latest and best methods are invari
ably employed, and where the most beautiful
and dainty food is always set out for the guests,
the Royal Baking Powder is exclusively used
for all quickly risen food.
Royal Baking Powder never disappoints;
never makes sour, soggy or husky food; never
spoils good materials; never leaves lumps of
alkali in the biscuit or cake; while all these
things do happen with the best of cooks who
cling to the old-fashioned methods, or who use
other Baking Powders.
If you want the best food, Royal Baking
Powder is indispensable.
