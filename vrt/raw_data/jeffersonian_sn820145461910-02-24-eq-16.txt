YERBA SANTA
The “Holy Herb” of the In
dians and the Mission Fathers of
the West, is a very pretty ever
green plant, which grows in most
inaccessible places in the moun
tains of California and Northern
Mexico. The leaves are dark
green, completely varnished by a
copious coating of resin. This
resinous compound is a marvelous
cure for coughs, colds, bronchitis
and consumption. In many places,
the plant is known as “Consump
tives’ Weed”, “Mountain Balm”,
or, among the Mexicans, “Yerba
Santa”. Made into a hot tea, it
is palatable, warms quicker than
whisky, and is absolutely harm
less. It will cure the obstinate
cases of throat and lung trouble;
and it is a specific in intestinal
disorders.
Send me a silver dime, or ten
cents in stamps, and I wfill mail
you a sample of the “Holy Herb”,
which at one time saved my life.
It can not hurt you, and if you
have a cough, cold, bronchitis, or
even pneumonia, it will cure you.

and decline. Now, of course I know
I can not hold a candle to you, but
I might, with your powerful push,
get to fill dates all the way from
California through Texas to Geor

Suppose you give me a “boom”

Now this is written for you to
make “alive” or “dead”, as you can
do. All I want is expenses and col

All Are Cowards Who Desert
Farmers’ Union
Dear friend: —I want to say to
the Union brothers that to desert
the Union now is cowardice. We are
needing good, true men now more
than ever: men that will fight for
the right, and never surrender, but
die for the principles that we
espouse. It is always darkest just
before day, and we will have a new
day after the June Convention.
Tell the Coffee County boys to
hold to their Union principles. All
men are not Lees, and we have some
men who are willing to do to others
as they wish others to do to them,
and are willing for us all to become
educated, in order that we may not
be enslaved.
We can not free ourselves from
the power of trusts and monopolies,
if we only let those who favor such
things teach us, and that behind
closed doors. We are of all men the
most miserable if we submit to that
kind of an education. Brethren,
arise in your strength and demand
your liberty. Ours is an education
al Union, and that does not mean
that we must shut our eyes and stop
our ears to everything but what our
would-be bosses would have us
know. If the charges brought
against some of our officers, by a re
sponsible man, are false, why don’t
they come out and deny them in the
open? It shows cowardice not to
do so, and rascality to slip around
and ask us not to believe these
things.
Mr. Watson, don’t hold up, but
keep on telling us what is going on
in the world, for we appreciate your
friendship. Ever your friend,
J. G. JORDAN.
Boston, Georgia.
A Protest From a Prominent
Farmers’ Union Man
Mr. B. F. Ward, Jr., Editor Union
Advocate, Jackson, Miss.
Dear Sir:—l am very much sur
prised and astonished, and that be
yond measure, at the attitude and
the course you have taken in regard
to the resolutions sent to you by
Ranking Local No. 44 7. You have
raised a great storm and created a
tempest. Where there should have
been a calm, instead of pouring oil
upon the troubled waters, you have
added fuel to the fire, and thus with
a little fire you have kindled a great
conflagration. When I wrote those
resolutions, and carried them to our
Union meeting for indorsement,. I
had in view the case of our State
President, G. R. Hightower, last
year. You know what he was
charged with. He was charged with
receiving pay as State Senator, after
he had resigned, and was elected
President of our State Union; also
he was charged with seeking the
Governorship of the State through
the Farmers’ Union, and tsus lead
the Farmers’ Union into politics, and
the Grenada Sentinel, our county pa
per (whose editor was a member of
the Farmers’ Union), was among the
first that began the circulation of
those charges. So President High
tower wrote me himself, and I have
his letter yet. Now, Brother Ward,
suppose our State President had done
©be - 3effersontan
as those fellows in Georgia are do
ing, slipped and slided around be
hind closed doors, don’t you know it
would have ruined him, and also
hurt our Union, just like it is doing
in Georgia. Sure it would, but
President Hightower did not act so,
he came out in the open, like a true
man, and to our complete satisfac
tion he disproved those charges. Now
those fellows in Georgia have been
charged by Mr. Watson of doing
dirty work, and he says he has got
the proof; and those charges have
not been made by Mr. Watson alone,
as you seem to think, but were also
made by the Dallas News, Houston
Post, and Graphic-Democrat. Under
the captain of “Lda Pass Local No.
1304, January 6, page 2, The Jeffer
sonian, they are mentioned. Now,
why don’t those men in Georgia
come out in the open like Hightower
did, and clear themselves? That is
all in the world that we poor devils
wanted them to do, and that 'was
right, and you know it, but you have
treated us with disrespect, and your
excuses are void of good reason, and
the clause mentioned by you in our
Constitution is foreign to the sub
ject matter under consideration.
Your editorial of January 19th did
not conform with the sentiments ex
pressed in our resolutions, not a bit.
You went clear out of the way to
make the impression upon your read
ers that Mr. Watson was slipping
the dagger into and fighting the
Farmers’ Union (which is false) and
those that read the Union Advocate
only think that Mr. Watson is really
fighting the Union, for I have seen
two men that only read the Union
Advocate, that said to me that Tom
Watson had gone to fighting the
Farmers’ Union. Os course I cor
rected them, and showed them that
it was only a few grand rascals that
Mr. Watson was exposing, but all
that read The Jeffersonian and the
Union Advocate, they know the facts
in the case, therefore understand
just what Mr. Watson Js doing, but
of course there are a good many
that read The Jeffersonian that
don’t read the Union Advocate that
don’t know anything much about
Brother Ward’s articles. There are
more people taking and reading The
Jeffersonians at Lilac than any other
paper that comes to this office, and
I am proud of it, for I am Mr. Wat
son’s agent at this office, and I have
worked him up a good large sub
scription list, not only here but at
other places, and by the God eternal
I am going to work harder for him
from this time on than ever before.
I am writing this of my own accord,
I am not asking my Union brothers
to back me up in this letter, al
though I have seen a good many of
them and asked them what they
thought of Brother Ward’s bad
break, and so far I have not seen
any that really approves of his debut,
and I did say in my personal letter
to Brother Ward that I was going
to write a letter and get their in
dorsement and send it to Mr. Wat
son for publication, but I have de
cided not to do it, so of my own ac
cord I write this letter, and if the
brothers indorse it, they can let me
know it, without me hunting them
up. .1 am sure that our people will
not stand for ring rule and gag law.
President Barrett is not our God,
that we should wait on his dictation,
nor Brother is not our Christ, that
we should abide his- decision.
Now, if Brother Ward had dealt
fair with us and Mr. Watson there
would have been none of this.
“Things have come to a hell of a
pass, when a man cannot wallop his
own jackass.”—The Issue.
Now, Brother Ward, I am not
mad, but my feelings are hurt, and
lam feeling ugly. I despise a cow
ard and am not afraid of a brave
man, and those fellows in Georgia
are either guilty as per charged, or
they are a darned set of cowards,
and no honest nor brave man will
seek to uphold them in either case.
President Barrett is, I don’t doubt, a
good honest man, but he is running
after fool’s gold when he is running
after Taft and the Republican-Demo
crats to get measures passed for the
benefit of the laboring class. Just
as well run after the Devil to get
him to enlist in the cause of Christ.
Now, Brother Ward, if you had
stated in your first editorial that
this matter was a Georgia trouble
and asked us to wait and let them
settle it, that would have satisfied
me, and all the rest of us, and that
was as far as you ought to have
went, but you went of your way, and
I believe (I hope that I am mis
taken) that you did it with the de
liberate purpose of offending, not
only Mr. Watson, but all of his
friends, and you have made a mess.
Now, may God be with you, is
my prayer, until we meet again, and
wishing you a long and happy life, I
am respectfully your obedient serv
ant, J. H. POWELL.
Lilac, Mississippi.
Duck and Drake Shy on Rules
Dear Mr. Tom Watson: —I am
proud and thankful that we have
such a man as you are, with the
nerve to contend for our rights.
Brother Watson, keep ripping up
this Foreign Mission question. Show
them up in their true form. Show
up Duckworth and the rest of the
traitors that have crept into the
Farmers’ Union. lam President of
Tom Creek Local No. 1610. I am
proud of the fact that you have put
the boys on notice of the dirty work
done in the corner. I had the priv
ilege of meeting Duckworth one time
in our county meeting. He had a
two-by-four lawyer with him named
Drake. We took up the room word
and found all O. K. but Drake; the
conductors turned in their report,
found all in possession of current
room word but Drake. Duckworth
said, “This fellow is all right.” I
saw at once that Drake was a fish
eater. You have shown Duckworth
and the, rest of the bunch all the
courtesy a/ man need to show. lam
with you for a square deal, that is
all we want.
My father has been a strong ad
vocate for true reform for fifteen
years and has voted for you every
time you were in the field. A. L.
Brown, my father, has five boys and
all are Watson’s friends.
Brother Watson, keep up the good
work, we will win bye and bye.
Your friend, J. H. BROWN.
