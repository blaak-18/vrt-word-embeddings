"Et Tu Brute !"
In the last issue of the Natchitoches
Republican, an anonymous scribbler
"let fly the deadly contents" ofa small
bored pop-gun at "Squire Jack." Since
the publication of the article, Mr. E.
L. Pierson, of this place, has vrolun
tarily championed its authorship and
laid title to its merits, which was
certainly an act of supererogation on
his part, as the taste and style as well
as the utter want of "pith or point'"
that characterize it, were amply suffi
cient to establish its authenticity.
This contemptible assault was wholly
unprovoked by any word or act on the
part of Mr. Jack, assailing either the
status or sentiments of the pugnaciotus
little gentleman, and it must therefore
le considered as a purely gratuitous
display of malevolence on his part.
It must be conceded, that there is
nothing in the matter of it, that could
be regarded as personally otffnsive,
for the gist, as well as the particular
motive, thatmay have prompted it,
is certainly one of those mysteries
"that passeth all understanding." The
ground of our con plaint is, that we
were attacked at all at this jgfnetu.re,
by that gentleman. We were fully un
dter the impression, that it was a well
known fact, throughout the conmmuni
ty, that "Squire Jack," in company
with many others, was on a "regular
Bear hunt" and was without any in
tention of disturbing the smaller ani
mals.
This being the case, it was certain
ly not expected that they would wan
louly annoy hint in the chase, by fool
ishly running into the line of his fire.
Whilst it is true, that it could make
no possible differeuce in the end, it is
calculated to make us lose time and
our usual good temper.
It has been observed by hunters
in the jungles of Africa that the Lion
oftentimes, when hayed in his lair, by
a pack of noble mastiffs, will, with a
seeming respect for such foes, main
tain for hours an attitude of serene
and majestic composure, whilst the
buzz of a blue bottle fly about his
ears will lash him into fury in as
many moments. Nor is this suscept
ibility of aggravation f r o m such
causes, peculiar to him, it is shared
in common with other animals and
with man himself. What for exam
]le is better calculated to disturb our
equanimity than the buzz or bite of
a puny musquito f"
It is due to our "author" to state,
that taking advantage of the rule of
construction, which allows us 'when
the letter is unintellegible to consider
the spirit," we have come to the con
clusion that the sting of the satire is
sheathed in the "Squire" part (we
may be mistaken however, aq it is
possible, he didn't know how to spell
the word) and that it is derisively
used to denote our relation to the
learned and noble profession of the
law whose worthy votaries are known
as Attorneys, Counselors, or Lawyers.
The word "Squire," (to judies,) is
inteedod to indicate, when applied to
the legal profession, a quasi lawyer.
We will accept it in the sense which
your words would import, (if they
mean anything) and for the sake of
the discussion, we confess and justify.
We will come squarely on the merits
--some, under such circumstances,
imight recriminate, with a view to a
'drawn battle"-and would call you
a "Squire" too, but we do not we al
ways make it a rule not to darge a
man with anything that cannot be
proved. Yes, we are a "Squire" a
"'Squire Jack" if youn will, and we
have conie to this "title"n by great la
bor and under great disatlvantages-, I
having studied our profession for the
greater part, over pine knot fires by
night and in the silent woods by day,
without a preceptor and without I
other enconragement than the as- I
surance that he may worthily wear, I
whlo faidrly winu. We may here add, I
witihout thie imputation of vanity, I
that that tide thus aoo, has within a
very few years raised as front a. con- I
dition of poverty and obscurity, to
one of tolerable competency, and to
that which is'of far greater value, the I
confidence of the people and the Lhsn- I
orable recognition of the Bar of Louis- i
mana. Nor is this all, it has enabled I
us to take under our charge and guid- t
ange, not a few young men, who were I
animated by. a like desire, and to t
lead them smoetkly over the once rug- t
ged path that we had traveled, until
they had reached the goal of their
aspirafions-admission to the Bar. ,
Here, let us state that what we have t
said, has not been spoken in a spirit J
of eelf-sufliciency. No one can more i
keenly feel than we do, that our abil
ities have been overrated by a too I
generous public, and that we have I
been thrown into prominence often- t
times, when others far mpre deserv- i
ing of such recognition have been
wholly overlooked. So far as we are
personally concerned, in this great
popular movement, it matters not j
whether we are ln the roll of officers
or in the ranks, so that victory is won
and peace and prosperity are once I
more restored to this unhappy land.
But to return to our subject. Mr. ,
Pierson in a style truly patriarchal,
warns the Repqbliean party "not to
he caught with sech partizan clap- a
trap as that used in "Sluire AJek's c
speeeh on Saturday last: I care not i
whether a man be a Democrat or Re
publican, white or black, green or
yellow, so he is an honest and eomn- a
potent man, he will receive the sup- t
port of all right thinking met," (It t
mlay be staled parenthetiaosll that
the words "green and yellow' were t
not used by Mr. Jack-the mistake t
was doubtlessly uniutentional if not I
natural, as Mr. P's ideas have quite ,
a pronenen to those colors.) We
must be excused in stating that on
firtt reading this paternal and omin
ons admonition, a feeling somewhat I
preternatural flashed over us. We I
almost fancied that the startled spirit
of Greeley, of Chase or of Sumner, had
come up from the shades, to warn the "
party, wnhose life-long servants they L
had been, of the hidden snares .td
pit-falls that "the enemy" was p a
cing in the way ; imagine, howev r,
our great surprise and relief on read
is ing further, to find from the disjoint d
tr structure, that it was not the work f
I- one of the "old masters" but of a li -
e ing personage and that personage o
. other, in his corporeal entity, th u
1- our former redoubtable and truly
d repressible Fusion supervisor of regia
s tration ! We could but exclain,
n Saul! Saul!! why persecutest thfdt
Il me ! "Wert thou not with us but a
ยบ' short time ago, a Democrat after t e
l- strictest sect of the Warmothites "
P. Ditl'st thou not, among others, ho l
y Pinchback's political "robe, whie
e they Were stoning him to death "
e When ! oh ! when, "wert thou anoin -
8 ed, O King !'t We were vwholly ove -
e powered in contemplating the in -
s mense distance over which you h: it
b. traveled in so short a time-the fias -
.5 est political time on record.
d Next in the order of this article, we
1, find some indefinite question abo t
*r Isnue kind of petition, the Democr s
b, were trying to have signed, reque t
s ing a Democrat to resign, because te
e had voted for an honest Republicau ;
e if we understand you nright, we o -
, collect on one occasion, that an i t
- diridual applied to us to draw up sn h
a1 petition, which we promptly refis d
- as did another Democrat then prose t
y -since which time we have heard
r nothing more of it. .As to certa in
legal gentlemen being denounced iy
an "Oligarchy" for something, tlat
you do not explain, we must confess
our ignorance of the fact, as well as
the meaning of your allusiqp.-Did nt
your gun go off accidentlly alopug
, here t Let us now come to the g st
e of the thing (if peradventure, thre
3 be any) and see if we can not und r
I stand each other a little better. W ly
do you object so bitterly to the d c
s trine, that you so lately advocate 1?
a Is it simply because we announce ' f
v or have you concluded that the te ts'
a are too severe ? in either case, let us
assure yop that it was intended sin p
ly as a rule to apply to our own pa ty
e and in no sense affects you. Aga in,
s you take occasion to inform us, tl at
3 there is no danger in "the cloud r s
- Ing in the horizon, no larger than a
It man's hand but ever growing by t y
I and by night, until it shall sweep mhe
I whole length and breadth of the ltuid
- -the white man's league."
r So said the antediluvians, one to
f another, when Noah warned them of
the black-browed elements of a d1
u, ge, that were gathering in horrid i
f ence around them: So said the So o
t mites to Lot, even when the messt t
r ger was with them, that brought t ie
tidings of the destroying fires of Ile, v
en. Yea ! in later tiones, a sons al
and seltish Sardinapalus commanm d
his dupes to "On with the dane ,"
I when the exterminating Legions w re
already within his gates. We do ot
say however, that you are not wi er
than they of the past or even pres unt
generations-it may be, and we tre
led to suppose, that your suple or
foresight, has enabled you to pit ce
the dark mantle of the Future aumd to
say "that all is well." ' But be it 'e
iecmibered and let it notw beplaced y Bon
the record, that we, in view of the 11
omnened appearances, have decla ed
aloud, in the voice of solemn and oar
est warning to all, that a convul on
was coming which would shake his
Land friom centre to circumfere ce,
unless thie councils of thie good, the
wise and thie true, should avert it, tnd
that you Mr. Pierson, cried out "I eed
himn not-this is all lpartizan clap
trap."
We will do you the clharity, how.
ever, to suppose that these rash words
addressed to a people, were rather an
expression of your belief as to your
own personal safety than as to theirs,
and from this point of view, your
Sprognogtication of the "cloud" would
probably be correct. We are not cer
,tain of the fact, but we have inferred
from circumstances that it was the
settled policy of bothl parties to con
tinue you in a state of armed neutrali
ty during the present contest. If
there has been any change in your
seeming relation to both parties, it
has been quite recent and we haive
not been advised of it. At all events,
it is a position that you hiavve occupied
for some time to the great satisfac-,
tion of both belligerents, and it is to
be sincerely hoped that you will con
tinue to hold "the balance of power"
to the end.
One more word at parting. Do not
suffer yourselfto become "weary in
well doing" but occasionally during
this contest, let us hear the report of
your well known pop-gun. We think
it necessary for two reasons: 1st, it
will keep us from forgetting you; and
2dly, it will prevent the soldiers of
both sides from going in your direc
tion. It does'nt matter which line you
fire on.
WILLIAM IH. JACK.
W. H. Tunnard the editor of the
Republican, the ring organ in this city,
takes ambrage at some allusions we
made in an article in this paper some
weeks since, in which we declined to
receive soldierly advice from one
whose knowledge of the qualities of
a man of war, was Obtained from a
close connection with a Commissary
Department. We are truly glad the
shot has told so well. We perfectly
agree with him that "the records of
the past have nothing to do with
present political differences," but
they have mauc to,do with the charac.
ter of the men whoi advocate those po
litical difference; and we c6nted,
and all candid minded men will ad
mit, that the character of men shape
and give respectability not only to
political parties, - but to every other
position a citizen may take in life,
and following out this hypothesis, we
are free to admit that the leaders of
the Radical party here, look as if they
I had no war record, or had one ac
-quired in so good a school' as the
SQuartermaster or Commissary depart.
mnents, which were, during the late
f unpleasantness, notoriously corrupt.
If he did not wish to "resuscitate" the
war, he should have refrained from
such expressions as were used in his
issue, which drew the remarks from
us that so nettles him. Mr. ' unnard
you were the lirst to begin this "war
business," but we propose you shall
not have the last "say" about it. As
far as our statements then made are
concerned, we were not ignorant of
the ficts when we made them, and
if you desire proof of such a fact, we
are Iprepared to furnish it. As for
the "sanguinlry engagements," as
you choose to term them,. that you
took part in, we can only suppose you
allude to the slaughter of rats with a
blow gun at the Round House, during
the seige of Vicksburg, which you
sold to the men at 50 cents each.
Anrl1 we ca'n Ulie ,fuit authoriti .J/or this
also. Our advise to you is to be very
particular in future how you italisize
the word "soldier," when you allude
to us, as we Oar a little vain of our war
record, we migh!t he tempted to give
you a touch of a Virginia engage

Dear Growler :
Please inform me what your opinio
is of an editor of a newspaper whose
columns are filled with articles sup
porting corruption; claiming at the
same time to make an honest livinug;
but when he is criticised relative to
articles which appears in it,. he says,
"he did not write theLn," and seems in
dignant that any personi should make
any "attack upon his private busi
ness."
While I am oil the subject of pri
vate business, please tell me which
is tihe worst crime, stealing a horq
or sevehty dollars per month from the
poor achlool children, and if it does iot,
cease to be private when it is general
ly known
Yours, RATTLER.
Judas, when lie betrayed his mas.
ter for thirty pieces of eilver, con
sidered it a "private matter," and no
doubt was tvery "indignant" when
"jerked up"'about it. From our
knowledge of the individual hie would
support, anytliing for money and is
in no way "hoggish" about the amount
paid him. Stealing a horse is of
course the greatest crime, for the theft
of $70 from the poor school children
is "excused" by the Ilth amendment I
which will be proposed to the Ten
Commandments.

The Sa' urday Evening Post.
Thit Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
Slished.
/ Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
/ For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and un1lenmished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Iaper
that is published in this country, fromt its
never containing anythiig that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not he read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, FOLID AAD SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
tran6ons influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &c.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
lug Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect.a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call th our assistance writers of admitted
alillity And known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
and. adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate the popular, taste, by in
ereasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged tiaeilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of TIlE
OLDEST ANiD THE BEST of Family Story

publishers of the Aldine, by l'homas Mo

dollars. The subjects were chosen to rep.
resent ' The East" and "The West." One
is a view of the, White Mountains, New
ihianpshire ; the other giivcs the cliffs Of
Green River, Wyomling Territory. The
differelice in the nature of the scenes
themselves is a pleasiug contrast. and af

ed from thirty distinct llates, and are in
size (12 by 160) and aplpearance exact fac
similes of the originials. The presentation
