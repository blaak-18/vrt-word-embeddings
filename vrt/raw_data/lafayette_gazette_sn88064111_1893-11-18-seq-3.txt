BEA UTIFUL BRIJALS. AM
Seldom has Lafayette witnessed a more A
brilliant wedding, than the nuptials of Mr. St
Alfred Mouton and Miss Alix Judice, sol- W
emnized with eclat at the Catholic church
last Thursday evening.
The weather wan beautiful, mild and soft,
Stypical of a lovely spring day, ushered into el
existence,apparently, to lend its aid to render g
Sthe happy event all the more auspicious, and
t there were inot a few who regarded the day
as a most favorable omen for the handsome B
young couple.
The altar in the church was brilliantly de- L
corated with candles and dressed with sprays C
Sof lovciy chrysanthemums and daisies. From O
the chancel extending to the first pillars was k
a streamer of evergreens, adorned with ex
Squisite lawers, in the centre of which was
suspended a magnificent bouquet, and form
ing an arch under which the bridal party
pa-stil-. The chancel railing was encircled
- . ..s oi marguerites, vines and ever
us, the whole forming a gorgeous fairy I
ii i cene, and was the lovework of the bride's ii
c admiring young friends.
d Not only the seating, but the whole floor
capacity of the large church, was taxed to its F
Sutmost to hold the large assemblage who 5
d had congregated to witness the ceremony. a
is Even tihe convent school girls came in a n
e in a body to wish good luck to the young t
lady, who is their instructess in music. t
The groom is a member of the mercantile
Sfirm of Mouton Bros., is a young man of
fine attainmeZte, and enjoys a large measure t
of personal popularity.
t The bride is one of Lafayette's most es
d teemed young ladies; charmning in grace,
)f kind of heart, a bright mind, she has always
been a favorite in the social circles of the
community. In her bridal attire she was -
most becomingly gowned in an exquisite
le white sillk,beautifully trimmed with rare lace
and orange blossoms, with the usual veil of I
Is illusion completing her costume. She car
ried a bouquet of sweet flowers.
Df The Maid of Honor, Miss StellaaTiahan,
is an attractive and most graceful young lady,
e- silk gauze; and she, also, carried a beauti
twore an elegannt dress of salmon colored
d ful bouquet.
Shortly after five o'clock the groom, and
his best man, Mr. Ed. Mouton, arrived at
id the church. A few moments thereafter, the
bride and her maid of honor came, and were
met at the church door by Col. Gus. A.
S- Breaux, an uncle of the bride, who escorted
it her to the altar, where the groom awaited
se her.
of Upon the bride's entrance,-came from the
h- ofgrn the soft and sweet strains of the wed
ding march, executed by the talented Miss
E. Mouton. An "ave maria" was finely
sung by Miss Martha Mouton, whilst the
he couple was awaiting the entrance of tihe pas,
tor. After the beautiful and impressive mar
riage rites were performed, and before pro
a nouncing the benediction, the Rev. Forge
rid delivered an eloquent address joiniig his
he I congratulations to those of their many tr.ends.
ed As the last words were spmoken the bridal
party entered the vestry to sign the register,
but soon emerged and came down the centre
lix aisle and were driven to tile residence of
in the bride's mother, where a reception was
by held, Mrs. Judice and Mrs. G. A. Breaux
se doing the honors of the occasion. The young
couple were the recipients of many costly
presents.
Ve In embarking upon their life's journey
jd. they harry with them t he best wishes of a
host of friends for a bon voyage, and The
ry Gazette hopes that naught but bright sil
to viery clouds will ever appeiar in tihe horizon

Judge Allen is the recipient of
d much favorable comment by the
, state press, for his promptness in
y taking steds to squelch the bull-doz
s ing merchants of Franklin, who had
oreered five Jewish merchants to
:i pack up and leave the town. This
, spirit of racial persecution, which is
,. a relic of the barbaric ages, must
a not be tolerated in this state. By
g the judge's promntjness in the mat
e ter, and upon his assurance that
,f they will be protected in their righýt
re the five merchiants waited upon are
still in busine s. Judge Allen has
s done his siImpl rlutity, and is receiv

a for so doing.
