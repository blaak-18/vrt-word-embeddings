Guntown, Miss., Feb 6, 1907.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir:
1 have just enjoyed the rare treat
of your Magazine for January and
February. Am delighted that you are
issuing it, and hope you will soon have
a great patronage. The ground on
which you put it certainly apepals to
many reformers.
BUT —Why not ALL reformers work
together? WHY are not you and Mr.
Bryan together? ALL reformers
SHOULD stand for all that is good.
I can agree fully with YOU and Mr.
Bryan. BUT do you either agree with
me? I read with much interest all
that I see from YOU and MR. BRY
AN. But I have read it up to date
with MUCH disappointmeat. Why not
you and Mr. Bryan use your great
influence against the greatest evil we
have? He is a Presbyterian, and I
think I have heard you are a Baptist.
Am sure you are a good Baptist so far
as your love for liberty goes. But there
is ONE evil so daring, and SO destruc
tive to every good interest that all
GOOD men should find it easy to unite
against it. But they do not. I have
never seen ONE small article in any
of your papers against THE LIQUOR
TRAFFIC in our government. There
is a HYDRA HEADED MONSTER for
you with his fangs in the very vitals
of our government, and with his heart
fixed on the overthrow of the manhood
of every patron of his, and yet you,
a REFORMER, DO NOT FIGHT
HIM. The railroads rob us, but they
do not CORRRUPT ALL their pat
rons. The express company takes our
money to a severe muchness, but it
leaves us our MANHOOD. After ALL,
MANHOOD is the main thing, Mr.
Watson. Leave us that, and we can
live. You speak some noble words
FOR a better manhood, and I am sure
you see the thing clearly, but HOW
CAN YOU BE SILENT on the saloon
question? But I did not intend to
write you a long letter.
Please send me a specimen! copy of
your weekly paper, and I would like to
know your best terms to agents on
subscriptions to the magazine. If you
will ADD to your fight that of a heroic
effort for the complete overthrow of
the SALOON power I shall join you
in getting subscribers to the maga
zine. Why not turn that excellent Car
toonist loose on the RUM POWER?
There is a MONOPOLY worthy of
YOUR STEEL. Why not help us to
slay HIM?
Yours for ALL that is right,
G. T. HOWERTON.

FORMER WAR RECALLED.
The present conflict between Nicara
gua and Honduras recalls the war
between these countries in 1894. In
1894. In that conflict Nicaragua was
the victor.
The cause of the trouble thirteen
years ago was similar to that of to
day, the alleged invasion of Nicara
guan territory by Honduran troops.
After a month’s fighting Tegucigalpa,
the capital of Honduras, which again
seems to be the objective point of the
enemy, was captured. President Vas
quez of Honduras was deposed by the
victorious army and General Policarpo
Bonilla was placed in power. Then
the Nicaraguans withdrew from the
country. General Policarpo Bonilla is
no relative of General Manuel Bonil
la, the present Incumbent of the Hon
duran presidency.
A Nicaraguan in this city, who yes
terday received confirmation of the ca
ble dispatches from Managua, said:
“History is about to repeat itself In
Central America. Our forces will again
take Tegucigalpa. Bhls time it will be
accomplished much quicker, as our ar
my is much stronger than it was in
1894. I expect to hear very soon of
the capture of Hondusras’ capital by
Nicaragua.” t
LIBERAL USE OF FREE PASSES.
The Railroad Rate Investigating
Committee of the Tennessee Legisla
ture had further evidence from Mr. L.
K. Wenning, Auditor of the Nashville,
Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway. Mr.
Wenning was examined especially con
cerning the number of passes issued
by his company during 1906, and the
mileage traveled on free transporta
tion during the period mentioned. It
was developed that about 20 per cent
of the passenger transportation over
the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis
during 1906 was on passes.

EARTHQUAKE AT JAMAICA.
By Associated Press.
Kingston, Jamaica, Feb. 23. —A vio
lent shock of earthquake occurred yes
terday which caused quite a scare. It
was the heaviest shock since the disas
ter of January 1. No loss of life
occurred but damaged buildings col
lapsed.

WILL DECIDE NEXT WEEK.
By Associated Press.
Washington, Feb. 23. —It was an
nounced today that a final conference
will be held at the white house next
Monday between the president and
Secretaries Root and Taft relative to
the award of the contract for the con
struction of the Panama canal, and
that the decision will be announced
Tuesday.
Al! the parties in interdfct have now
been heard by the president and Sec
retaries Root and Taft. Their repre
sentations have been given full consid
eration, and it is also known that he
business and personal reputations of
some of these persons have been sub
jects of most careful and searching
private inquiry, which is expected to
have a most important bearing on the
decision to be announced next week.

BOYS HAVE RIGHTS.
A Mississippi small boy climbed a tree
and was shocked and seriously injured
by coming in contact with a live elec
tric wire. Suit for damages was
brought by the boy’s father and the
electric company contended that the
boy was out of his proper place in
the tree, and the company was not to
blame. The lower court decided to
this effect, but the supreme court of
the state has reversed the judgment
of the lower court on the ground that
a boy has a right to climb a tree.
m m m
LET ’EM FIGHT A LITTLE.
It appears that the governments of
the United States and Mexico, solic
itously inclined to use their good offi
ces to bring about peace between Hon
duras and Nicaragua, have concluded
that It is necessary to let those bellig
erent bantam republics knock them
selves a while before the proffer of
arbitration shall be made. Nations are
like individuals; they can sometimes
be more easily parted after they have
felt the punishment of their fighting.

WELL-KNOWN WRITER DEAD.
Special to the Banner.
Carrollton, Ky., February 23.
George Dallas Mosgrove, Confederate
veteran and widely known writer, was
found dead on the turnpike near here.
He is thought to have been the vic
tim of heart disease. Mr. Mosgrove
was the author of “A Kentucky Cav
alier,” and was a frequent contributor
to newspapers and magazines. He was
a member of Morgan’s command in the
civil war.

FOR MRS. J. T. JACKSON.
Represenatlve E. Y. Webb has se
cured the passage of the bill giving
to Mrs. Stonewall Jackson a pension
of S2O a month. This bill originated
in the senate, having been passed at
the Instance of Senator Overman, and
will now become law as soon as
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
it Is signed by the president and the
speaker. There was talk of the possi
ble application of the “Loyalty test”
while the bill was pending, and some
doubt was entertained about its final
passage. No obstacles arose, however,
after the bill had finally been reported
favorably by Chairman Laudenslager,
of New Jersey, of the sub-committee
in the house, to which the application
was referred.

DISCUSSION OF NEGRO PROBLEM.
Special to the Banner.
Chattanooga, Tenn., February 23. —
At the meeting of the Chattanooga
Press Club, which was organized yes
terday, the following resolutions on the
race question were adopted:
“Resolved, That it is the sense of
the Chattanooga Club that the sooner
the press of the country drops the dis
cussion of the so-called ‘negro prob
lem,’ the sooner the matter will be
settled.”

BUSY ON THE ISTHMUS.
(From the Tribune Bureau.)
Washington, Feb. 22. —“President
Roosevelt’s visit to aPnama will prove
worth millions in money and years
in time to the great enterprise,” said
Dr. Henry Waldo Coe, of Portland,
Ore.
“There is a brotherhood in this
whole canal business since Theodore
Roosevelt was there, in which he and
every worker on the zone worthy of
the name of worker are closely knitted
and which is to save the United States
many millions of dollars in money and
a vast amount of valuable time. Every
steam shovel, every engine, every drill,
there, is digging, hoisting, steaming,
whistling, drilling and blasting, a mer
ry unison of industrial music, and to
day through all of it is a chord of
thankfulness that the president was
there. The men behind these guns of
industry are vying with each other
to do a little more today than was done
yesterday, in honor of the president,
‘our friend at court, who has visited
us.’ ”

SENATE PASSES RATE BILL.
Raleigh, Feb. 22. —The feature of to
day’s session of the legislature was the
passage of the Graham rate bill, fix
ing railroad fares at 2 and 2 1-2 cents,
providing for first and second-class
and interchangeable mileage.

INCOMPETENT RAILROADING.
Sometimes it is a rear-end collision.
Sometimes it is an open switch.
Sometimes it is a misread order.
Sometimes it is a careless train dis
patcher. Sometimes it is a broken
rail or a broken axle or a broken
flange. Sometimes it is a reckless en
gineer. But it is always something.
Nothing interferes with the American
railroad's beneficent work of reduc
ing its patrons to pulp.
The wreck of the New York Cen
tral suburban express at Bronx Park
bridge, in which twenty-two persons
were killed and 150 injured, is the
same old story of incompetent rail
roading. Its only new feature was
the element of the third rail, which
added to the terror of the Injured and
hampered the work of the rescuers.
Whether the disaster was due to
the spreading of the rails or an ex
cessive rate of speed, the indictment
against the management is the same.

There is no excuse for spreading rails.
There is no excuse for excessive
speed. There is no excuse for flimsy
coaches that cannot hold to the track.
It is time that the responsibilty for
railroad wrecks was placed where it
belongs—and that is at headquarters.
In the matter of rigging the stock
market the American railroad mana
ger has no superior. In the matter of
providing safe and expeditious facili
ties for transportation he has no in
ferior in any nation of the first rank.
He can manipulate politicial conven
tions. He can debauch legislatures.
He can send his paid attorneys to
congress and sometimes put them on
the bench. In these matters he is a
master, just as he is a master in the
art of issuing and juggling securities.
It is only in the operation of railroads
that he is deficient. The mere detail
of transporting lives and property
safely and satisfactorily he seems to
regard as unworthy of his genius. His
equipment is usually inadequate. His
road bed is generally second class or
worse. His employes are undisciplin
ed and his system is archaic.
Whatever the causes may be, the
fact remains that, judged by the re
sults of operation, the American rail
road manager is incompetent, and the
records of death and disaster prove it.

N. Y. C. WRECK DEAD 23.
New York, Feb. 22. —Miss Mabel
Smith, the Katonah school teacher
who was injured in the Central wreck
last Saturday night, died last night in
Fordham hospital. Miss Smith had
spent the afternoon at a matinee.
Miss Smith was riding in the third
car of the train, and had a seat near
a window. A splinter of wood was
driven through her right eye and deep
into her skull. An astonishing thing,
said the doctors, was that after ex
tricating herself from the debris, she
walked up Webster avenue and ran
several hundred feet to a stable. There
she got a man to drive her to the
hospital.
