THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE,
AND A FEW LACONICS
A WOMAN PHILANTHROPIST OF
SOUTH GEORGIA.
It’s a peculiar fact that with all
the money Booker Washington has
succeeded in accumulating from the
Yankee people, the educational ad
vantages and privileges are open
only to the negroes who can pay.
That there is ia vast field of work
among Southern people for all sorts
of educational work, can not be
gainsaid. The argument for domes
tic mission work now seems to ap
peal to the zealots as much as the
foreign field does.
It is refreshing to note such wom
en as Miss Berry, who has devoted
her money, time, talent and powers
of persuasion to the development of
a school for white boys and girls and
who has struggled long and hard to
make a success of it.
There is another woman, in South
Georgia, who has, for many years,
devoted her life to the work of car
ing for boys and girls who would,
from the nature of their origin, be
more or less the neglected or the
children of chance.
Some fifteen or twenty years ago,
the Rev. A. G. P. Dodge was rector
of a church at Fredericka, on his
toric St. Simon’s; he was a Northern
man whose father had accumulated
many Southern interests. Mr. Dodge
married a Miss Anna Gould, whose
people had been identified with the
history of the Island for generations.
A little boy was born to Mr. and
Mrs. Dodge, but his life was snuffed
out by a tragedy which left the
parents dazed for many days. Be
fore their eyes, the little one was
trampled by a horse, and no other
little one ever came to take his place.
But even in their grief, these two
realized there was work to be done.
A visit to a city brought Mr. and
Mrs. Dodge in contact with a boy
whose birth was a tragedy; they
took him home with them; another
child of like parentage was heard of;
he also was brought to Fredericka.
A girl was added, then another girl;
then a couple more boys.
The beautiful home of the Dodges
was a real, true home for these chil
dren; the family life was the same as
that which surrounds any Southern
family of culture; a school was built,
and these children went, with the
other children of Fredericka. Mr.
and Mrs. Dodge were “Father” and
“Mother”.
Through all the illnesses of child
hood these boys and girls were as
carefully nursed as though they were
“flesh of the flesh and bone of the
bone” of this man and woman.
In course of time Mr. Dodge died.
But even this blow did not alter the
course of life Mrs. Dodge had fol
lowed with him. She took the bur
den of the care of her “family”
(which at one time reached sixteen)
and has seen those of the early days
grftw to young manhood and woman
hood.
After they passed beyond the lit
tle school, they were sent to schools
and colleges to equip them for their
life with the world.
And they each take their place
with boys and girls who have grown
under normal and natural family
conditions.
To all of them Mrs. Dodge is as
truly “Mother” as though she had
borne them. And this work is in
need of funds to keep it going; there
are plans Mrs. Dodge has wanted to
develop because of their practical
value to the children whom she is
educating; she has spared neither
her fortune nor her energy in carry
ing out this work, all of which is a
memorial to the little son she lost.
With two such women as Mrs.
Dodge and Miss Martha Berry de
voting their lives, their money and
their energies to the care of white
Southern children, doesn’t it seem as
though Booker and foreign mission
workers might let up a little in their
demands, and give the others a
chance?
To make practical men and wom
en, to equip them with a working
knowledge of trades and professions
needed by the world, is the aim of
both Mrs. Dodge and Miss Berry, and
while the work of the two is similar
in many ways, that of Mrs. Dodge has
been rendered more difficult because
of its being little known.
Any needed information of the
scope, plans, aims and results of the
work done by Mrs. Dodge will be
easily obtained. Her home is at Fred
ericka, St. Simon’s Island, Georgia,
and the result of her years of labor
may readily be seen in the children
she now has with her, and in the re
ports she receives from those who
are off at school or out in the world.
Os these latter, one of her boys is
an electrical engineer; one of the
girls is a professional musician; oth
ers have taken up various profes
sions, and all are a living example of
the success of the methods pursued
to educate and develop them.
VALUE OF THE ILLUSTRATED
CATALOGUE.
The advent of the illustrated cata
logue has been one of the “Ameri
can ideas” which other nations have
been slow to realize the value of.
A foreigner who had visited the
United States during one of the re
cent expositions, said he was amazed
at the manner in which all the “na
tives” conformed to the prevailing
mode of dress. And his wonder is
shared by any who has ever noted a
gathering of American people.
In European countries, the inhab
itants of all the large cities will be
more or less arrayed in garments of
fashionable cut; the hats of the wom
en, of even the poorer classes, will
show attempts at making them ap
pear of the season’s style, but the
country people have clothes that
were the vogue “when mother was a
girl and father was a boy”.
In the secluded settlements, the
isolated villages, the places removed
from the track of development, old
customs, habits and styles prevail,
3effcrsonlan

simply because of the utter lack of
contact or illustration of latter-day
styles and fashions.
In America, the illustrated cata
logue changed all this; the wise and
wily city merchant realized it, and
the catalogue with photographs of
the latest idea in hats, dresses, shoes
and wraps goes to the farms of the
interior, the borders and the extreme
sections of the whole country.
And the ingenuity of American
women is keen on fashioning and
copying from those same illustra
tions, if it so happens the originals
are beyond the family purse. And
it is thus the great American crowd,
out for its holiday or its sightseeing,
is always well-dressed and showing a
certain “style” which a crowd in no
other country can duplicate.
Great is the illustrated catalogue.
And the Meat Trust is going to
prove it has cards in the deck which
have not yet been played. The edict
has gone forth “shipments to be cur
tailed, and price to go up”; but the
faithful meat boycotters will eat
only “home-raised” and eschew the
butcher.

Even religion gives way to prog
ress, sometimes; a convent in Wash
ington has been sold to make room
for a fashionable hotel.

News item says “reform of the
Lords will follow English election”.
Heavens, what a job!

Another reason why tatooing
should be avoided: woman was badly
burned, needed new skin; husband
offered to give some of his, but it
was all covered with hearts, doves,
trees and initials, and the lady re
fused to be decorated.

We’ve often heard of men who
failed in business because of “cold
feet”, but it has remained for a man
in Chicago to claim that stomachache
caused his failure in business. His
largest creditor called for a settle
ment, and the bankrupt says he got
a severe stomachache as soon as the
creditor demanded $20,000.
* * *
“The Bostonian”, a political publi
cation published in Boston, Massa
chusetts, is hot in the collar because
“some wind-jammers have lied about
that great organization” (Tammany).
When William J. Gaynor was elected
as Mayor of New York, he went into
office with a good working knowledge
of Tammany Hall. And the few jobs
he has handed to Tammany members
shows conclusively how he esteemed
the “Braves”, as office-holders.

President Taft’s Cabinet seems to
be composed of a lot of misfit shelves.
None of the fixtures stay fixed for
any length of time, and the Execu
tive has more trouble with his execu
tive family than his august prede
cessor had with the whole country.

Chauncey Depew is making a lot
of conspicuous silence in these stir-
ring times. The dear boy has made
so much money out of his connection
with the trusts and the combines, he
doesn’t have to worry much at the
outcome of any paramount issue.

Bryan has been giving the Cu
bans some advice, we are told. If it
is of the same kind as that he dopes
the Democratic party with, the effects
will not be serious to the Cubans.

“Spirits Rise in Paris” says a
news headline; it is to be sincerely
hoped the effect will not be as dis
astrous as the rise of the Seine River
a week ago.
* * *
If the farmers keep on making
money and buying automobiles, they
may also add to their income by sell
ing their horses for meat. Chicago
is doing a rushing trade in horse
meat since beef took wings.
* * *
“Is the Democratic party afraid to
trust its own voters?” asks the Bal
timore Sun. Sure, and it hasn’t
trusted its leaders lately so’s you
could notice it.
* * *
When the farmer will adopt some
of the simpler plans of preserving
farm products, such as his forebears
practiced, he will be less the tool of
combines, trusts and exchanges.
