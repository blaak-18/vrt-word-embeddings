The Little Woman in ‘Brolvn
AH SIL F. RANSOM.
HE sat at the little table,
waiting, waiting. A little
woman with brown hair,
brown face and a brown
dress. Her eyes were
brown, too; in them and
in her face a fire was
burning. Not brightly, as
we have seen flames leap

up, around and over, kissing with
their great red lips the thing which
they consume, but smouldering, pres
sed down, covered up, held within
her by a force handed down from the
Moorish ancestor who followed Taric
el Tuerto into Spain and built an
empire there. Her ancestor had in
vaded France, had crossed the Chan
nel with William the Conqueror; his
children, feeling too strongly the old
love of liberty and conquest, would
not submit to kingly d°potism in Eng
land. They had come to America long
before the thirteen colonies had uni
ted as one. They had fought their
way westward and ever westward un
til now, she, their daughter, with the
old Saracenic love of learning and
liberty, sat here in a dim room in
one of the great cities of the West,
waiting as she had waited many days
for fortune to come in such a guise
that she, too, might conquer a world.
The room was long and in the far
thest end of a large oil painting, bril
liantly illumined by electric lights,
was standing. A single figure strid
ing forward with Cyclopean tread;
grey, floating draperies lost in the
surroundings as a mist is lost in sun
lit air; an upraised arm and hand; a
face, there you pause, your eye can
go no further. Majestic, authorita
tive, godlike , yea, more godlike than
the mind of artist has ever conceived,
yet tender, loving and innocent. “A
child in distress would run toward
that face for succor; a lion meeting
it in the path would get out of the
way,” one man had said and it was
true.
The door opened and a woman en
tered leading a child, a boy of five or
six years. The one at the table looked
up and a question crept into her face.
This was not a visitor, such people
did not come there; their visitors
were of the better class while this
one—
“ Will you pleasfe, lady, give me a
little something, anything, ten cents,
five cents, a penny, anything; please,
lady?”
The woman in brown shook her
head.
“I have nothing to give.”
“Please, lady, help me just a little;
my husband is sick, I must pay my
rent.”
“No, I can not; I have nothing/’
The beggar, she seemed an Italian,
was very persistent. She repeated
her request and told the old story of
sickness, of trouble, of babies and
inability. We all know it, only too
well; we can hear it every hour in
the day if we wilt but listen.
“No; I have nothing to give; I
can not help you.” The woman in
brown was firm.
But the other did not hear. She
had edged around where she could
see the painting. She started for
ward, walked down and crouched
upon the floor before it, forcing the
child to his knees beside her. Then,
with uplifted hands and face, tears
streaming from eyes all too used to
them, she poured out such a prayer
as made her hearer clutch her hands
together and shut her teeth hard.
The prayer was in an unknown ton
gue, but was not the heart speaking?
Did not her heart answer? The fire
in her eyes and face began to glow,
the ashes were being raked aside,
God’s free air was kissing it, fanning
it, soon it would blaze. Cover it up,
crush it out, stamp it down; fires
must not burn, eyes must be dry, lips
steady and hearts cold while one
works and waits and longs for that
which never comes.
The prayer was ended, the arms
were Towered and the head of the wo
man sank closer and closer to the
floor. She lay quiet for a long time;
no one came in and the woman by
the table neither moved nor spoke.
She, too, was a beggar, only in a dif
ferent way and for a different thing.
She, too, had knelt and prayed and
fallen prostrate but that was when
the fires had leaped up. Better keep
the lips together.* the body upright,
the head erect and stamp out the fire
before one is consumed.
The woman rose, her boy with her,
and came forward. Her cheeks were
still wet, her lips trembled. “Good
bye,” she said and would have passed
out.
The other held out a detaining
hand. “No, do not go yet; I w r ant to
talk to you. Tell me your name, your
story, where you live.”
Rising, she moved a little back from
the table where two chairs were
placed near together, bade the woman
seat herself in one while she took the
other and listened.
The story told in language so
broken as tp be almost unintelligible
was this; they were Armenians,
driven from their own country by the
persecutions there. They had been
told that they could pick up gold in
the streets of America. Instead of
that, her husband, unused to hard
labor, had obtained employment dig
ging ditches; he had caught cold,
pneumonia set in, then consumption,
he could live but a little while, their
rent was due, they were to be evicted,
she thought she might beg enough to
pay their rent. It was the first time
she had ever begged, but what could
she do? She told where they lived, a
room in the worst quarter of the city,
rising to go.
“I thank you,” she said. “I go
happy. I know that dear Christ will
help me. I have prayed to Him; He
will help me, I know He will. I go
home now\ Goodbye, lady, goodbye;
I thank you.”
Later the artist came in and the
woman in brown told him of the Ar
menian and her prayer.
“Tomorrow is Christmas,” she
said. “Let us go tonight and see if
her story is true. If it is, let us buy
them something to eat.”
That night, dark, cold and rainy,
they went groping and stumbling
down the steep hill where the woman
lived. They found a negro doctor,
over ninety years old, who was treat
ing her husband, and he went with
them to her. A saloon keeper next
'Seffcrsonian
door offered to look after the hus
band and baby and they took her with
them to the public market. She went
home with a loaded basket but before
leaving them she clasped their hands
in hers and repeated over and over:
“I knew, that dear Christ w’ould
help me; I knew that dear Christ
would help me; I knew He would.”
The next day the artist and the
little woman in brown had a few stale
crusts of bread for their Christmas
dinner. They had no visitors to see
the Christ picture; everyone was too
busy celebrating His birth to look
upon His painting and the artist who
thought to give the w 7 orld a clearer,
more exalted conception of that won
derful character, was forgotten in the
general rejoicing over His birth. And
the little woman in brown—since the
visit of the Armenian, the fire would
burn. She covered it up, crushed it
down and tried to stamp it out. “I
knew that dear Christ would help
me.” She, too, had prayed. Why
should one woman’s prayer be an
swered and another’s not?
The winter was gone, their means
were exhausted. How many days had
those calm, sorrowful eyes of the
Christ looked down upon her sitting
alone, waiting for some one to come
and by paying the small fee charged,
so feed them? She remembered how
one afternoon, she had prevailed upon
the artist to lie down. The weather
was bitter cold, she was thankful that
their rooms were warmed for them
and cold was not added to hunger for
they had eaten nothing since the
morning before. She thought no one
would brave the cold and storm but
while the artist slept a visitor en
tered. He handed her a piece of sil
ver and passed in. Oh, that piece
of silver; she hugged it in her glad
ness, she kissed it; she could hardly
wait for the visitor to go. He stayed
for what seemed to her a century of
time; examining, talking, asking ques
tions then when at last he went, she
hurried out to purchase food for the
. artist and herself. Ah, that was all
over now. The marvelous Christ pic
ture with the wonderful face which
had helped so many was rolled up and
put away. A great many had seen it,
some had paid, others had not. They
could not turn any who came away.
“Was it not His work they were do
ing?” said the artist. “Did He ever
turn any away?” But it takes money
to travel from one city to another, to
hire rooms and show pictures and
they had none. So there they stayed,
the painting in its case, out of sight,
the artist trying to find some one who
would give him an order for a smaller
picture and they, two, living—l won
der how?
Summer was gone, winter was
treading hard on the footsteps of au
tumn when, one day, on one of the
business streets, the little woman felt
some one grasp her hand and cover
it with kisses. She looked around, it
was the Armenian.
“Oh, I have found you!” she cried.
“I look and look, I want to find you,
to tell you how the dear Christ helped
me. - I knew He would, I knew He
would.”
A crowd had gathered, they gather
