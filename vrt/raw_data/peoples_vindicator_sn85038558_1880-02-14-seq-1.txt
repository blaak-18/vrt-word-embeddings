LIVER PILLS
FIOR riE CLRE OF
Hepatitis, or Liver Complaint,
iV'4PRPS AND SICK HiRADACIE.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
lDAN in the right side, under the
Sedge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimdes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something Which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitud: enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND }'EVER.

c&Vor AL.E. ANU Fiv.vI, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgalive, they are un
equaled. .e

With the Dead Leaves.
From the Japanese.
Watehing the dead leaves drifting alen
Urged by the keen wind's restless feet
Tossed here and there in a shudderina
throng,
Through the alleys and lanes of the
rain-swept street,
Wander my mem'ry back to the time
When I wooed my love with pigh and
rhyme.
Then it was spring, and the sun.rays
shone
On fresh young tints from a. elondle.
sky;
And I with my sweetheartbtrilled along
To tell her soul's deep ecstasy,
I kissed her smiles, and my thoughts
love-mad,
Ne'er dreamed that the future could
be sad !
But winter came and the green leaves
fell,
My lordve's soual went to the Dremlaund
shore;
And the winter with the dead leaves
sang the knell
Of the good true heart I should woo no
more;
So when Ihear the leaves and the rain
I think of my love and live again.
