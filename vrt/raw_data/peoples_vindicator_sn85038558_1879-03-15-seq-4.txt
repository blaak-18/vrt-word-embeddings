know at what time the confusion
arose. The convention adjourned
late at night.
I know W. C. Roses. I heard him
make a speech at Campte. I think he
made a speech in ward No. 2. The
whites constituted a majority at both
meetings. I did not hear him speak
of any other means of carrying the
parish against the Republicans but
the ballot. I have never stated to
anybody that I heard Mr. Ross say
that the Democrats would carry the
parish by powder and ball. I never
heard him say it.
CROS-*EXAMINKD.
By Mr. Egan-One of the causes
assigned for the adjournment was
that the negroes were marching on
the tosn. I saw no arms at the
meeting. It was an ordinary con
vention. It was after the meeting
had dispersed, and it was reported
armed negroes were marching on the
town that I saw arms. Before the
convention was called to order, I
circulated freely about town, and
saw no evidence of trouble brewing.
Everything was quies and the peo
ple were friendly.
