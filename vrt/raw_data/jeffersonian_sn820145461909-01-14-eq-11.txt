‘‘For years I suffered with what I
thought was stomach trouble, when
the doctors told me I had heart
trouble. I had tried many remedies,
when the Dr. Miles’ almanac came
Into my hands, and I concluded to
a Dr. Miles’ Heart Curs. I have
en three bottles, and now I am
not suffering at all. I am cured and
this medicine did it. I write this in
the hope that it will attract the at
tention of others who suffer as I did.”

great many things. But you and Al
len are so young.”
“Young, mother?” the expectant
look left the girl’s face. “Why, Al
len’s twenty-one and I’m seventeen.
Older than you were, when you were
married. ’ ’
“Well, I caught you off your guard,
like a good mother should. So it is
Allen?”
“Yes, mother, it is Allen. I love
him with all my heart.”
“I am sure Allen is a splendid
young man. I hope that he will be
worthy of love like yours. I know,
too, that he loves you. What is the
matter, then?”
“Oh, oh, it’s that horrid Laura
Willard!”
“Horrid Laura Willard? Why,
she’s your very good friend and a
lady. You mustn’t, Marion.” Mrs.
Yerby was patting the rich brown
hair.
“But I will, mother,” she said, with
a tearful pout, “I’d like to tear her
false hair out.”
“Daughter, I really must rebuke
you. You must not talk like this. You
seem to have forgotten yourself. Tell
me everything.”
Marion was in a dilemma. Could
she tell her mother of this ridiculous
affair without being both reprimand
ed and laughed at? She feared not.
But she blundered into it. She told
the story, garbled as she had heard
it. At times she paused while her
mother waited patiently for her to go
on. The poor dusty switch had to
serve yet again for this sweet, proud
girl’s heart-ache. Then, when the
was told, Marion looked up, red and
teary, and waited for her sentence.
Her mother had dropped her embroid
ery and had her hands on the young
girl’s shoulders.
“So this is the story you wanted
to tell your black mammy?”
“Yes, Lady.”
‘ ‘ She ’d think you were turrible bad,
I’se afraid. Well, how did Allen tell
you this bit of scandal?”
Marion gave his version.
“Don’t you think Allen a gentle
man, child?”
“Yes, mamma, I do.”
“And yet you think he has told an
untruth, Marion?”
“Oh, no, no, mother, I don’t think
that! I don’t think —I don’t know
what I do think, mother.”
“Well, believe him, Marion. It
will save you both much misery. ’ ’
“Oh, should I, mother?”
“Yes, I know. Some day I’ll tell
you a little story. I’ve known Allen
and Alien’s family. You love him
and he loves you.”
“Yes, but I’ll make him explain
again.”
“By all means, do, child. It won’t
hurt either one of you. So cheer up,
birdie, and all will be right.”
Allen Breckenridge when he knew
he was right could go ahead with all
the fire of the poet. When he saw
that Marion was asking him for the
same story again he gave it with un
varied version. When he had fin
ished he once more commenced to
plead. The young lady, very eager
to surrender, sat in seeming hesita
tion. He took her hands and kissed
them. Then, then she kissed him
“Jeffersonian
and as her mother entered the room
she heard the little hypocrite say,
“Allen, why didn’t you tell the story
like this the first time?”
ORCHARD LANDS LONG AGO.
The orchard lands of Long Ago!
Oh, drowsy winds, awake and blow
The snowy blossoms back to me
And all the buds that used to be!
Blow back along the grassy ways
Os truant feet and lift the haze
Os happy summer from the trees
That trail their tresses in the seas
Os grain that float and overflow
The orchard lands of Long Ago!
Blow back the melody that slips
In lazy laughter from the lips
That marvel much if any kiss
Is sweeter than the apple’s is.
Blow back the twitter of the birds —
The lisp, the titter and the words
Os merriment that found the shine
Os summertime a glorious wine
That drenched the leaves that loved
it so
In orchard lands of Long Ago!
Oh, memory, alight and sing
Where rosy bellied pippins cling
And golden russets glint and gleam
As in the old Arabian dream
The fruits of that enchanted tree
The glad Aladdin robbed for me!
And, drowsy winds, awake and fan
My blood as when it overran
A heart ripe as the apples grow
In orchard lands of Long Ago!
—James Whitcomb Riley.
UTILIZATION OF COTTON
WASTE.
A brief discussion of cotton waste
is included in this part of the bulle
tin. It is estimated that the annual
amount of this waste is 195,000 pounds
or about 8 per cent of the raw mate
rial worked. There has been a marked
increase in recent years in the quan
tity of waste exported. Os the 45,-
784,437 pounds exported, about 86 per
cent was taken by European countries.
It is especially in demand among man
ufacturers in Germany, where it is
spun into coarse yarn and used in the
manufacture of toweling, quilts, flan
nels, etc. The utilization of this waste
in the United States has received com
paratively little consideration. —Phoe-
nix-Girard Journal.
We were a little surprised a few
days ago to find SSO lying in the road
beside the hedge and the, corner of
one of our prominent business farm
er’s home, and the more so to find
that it had lain there for quite a
while unmolested, but beginning to
look much the worse owing to expos
ure. The money was in the way of
farm implements that will have to be
replaced by new ones before many
years unless cared for better. This
is food for thought for the farmer. —
