DASHED HOPES.
In the dim corners of Lady Arling
ton's big drawing-room in Grosvenor
place rose-shaded lamps were casting
a tender glow, but near the three tall
windows and in the center of the
room there was still sufficient day
light to illuminate the faces and frocks
of the guests who were assembled for
dinner.
Lady Arlington, clad in shimmering
S white satin and wonderful pink pearls,
flitted like a spirit from group to
group; now greeting a fresh arrival,
now pairing off her friends.
"Lady Susan, Lord Marrable will
take you down. He's awfully dull, I
know, but [Iertie Fancourt is your
other side. Sir Charles, you're des
tined to the tender mercies of Dolly
Lansdown. Take care of yourself;
she's a dreadful little flirt, and boasts
of her victims. Ah! Olivia, I'm de
lighted to see you. CoL Egerton. take
care of my friend, Mrs. Abinger, for a
9 few moments till her cavalier turns
up. What a nuisance your sex is,
colonel. Hlere we are, twenty-three
hungry souls, all waiting for one
tiresome man. Olivia, my dear, if in
five minutes he does ;ot turn up I'm
afraid you'll have to go downstairs
alone."
.And with a gay little laugh Lady
Arlington tuflned away.
Mrs. Abinger smiled after her re
e. treating figure.. and Col. Egerton,
d, catching sight of her slightly-curled
- mouth, thought she had the sweetest
lips he had ever seen, and so thinking,
he looked the closer.
lieo saw a slender woman, with a
shapely head set upon a round, white
throat. The low-cut bodice of her
plain black gown clasped a slight
1e waist and made a fitting framework
it for her dimpled shoulders. Her big
"y black fan seemed all too heavy for her
b tiny wrists and small pink-tipped fin
f gers. In the fast-fading light he could
scarcely distinguish her features, but
he noticed that her hair was soft and
fair, and that her eyes were large and
just a little sad.
The gallant colonel was still won
dering what kind of a voice so charm
ing a woman could have, when the
door was flung wide and a tall man
strode into the room. Lady Arlington
heaved an audible sigh of relief,
waved rather than spoke an introduc
tion between Mrs. Abinger and the
newcomer, and then, like a multi
colored snake, her guests rustled down
the wide white staircase to dinner.
There was a momentary dragging of
silken trains under chairs and a gen
eral settling down before the last ar
rival turned to scan the woman at his
side, whom in the swift transit from
the drawing-room to the dining-room
he had only vaguely concluded was
slight, and pretty, and fair-haired.
"Olivia! You?" His tone of aston
ishment was too loud for good breed
ing, but the chat albout the table was
lively, and no one heard his voice save,
indeed, Mrs. Abinger.
"Yes, it is I. I knew you the mo
ment you entered, though the room
was almost dark"
"And yet we've not met for so many
years," he said; then, with the gal
lant after-thought of a man of the
world, he added: "Not that you loo:
one day older than when-"
She finished the sentence for him:
"WVe parted."
There was a sigh in her voice and a
touch of pure sentiment in her sad
eyes as she spoke, and recalled, as
women love to do, the agony of that
hour, fifteen years ago. which had
torn her from Angus Ferrers' arms.
She had been so young then-little
more than a child-but her whole soul
had been given to her boyish lover,
and the parental edict which had sent
Angus to India and herself to a
wretched marriage had nearly broken
her heart.
But the dream of the past was dis
pelled by him who had recalled it.
"And you married '." he said.
"Yes; I was obliged. Mr. Abinger
was rich in those days, and he bought
me."
"In those days! Is he not so now?"
"He died two years ago, a pauper."
Mrs. Abinger spoke quietly. She
had lived so long with the tragedy of
existence that it had lost its most
poignant thrills, and had degenerated
into a gray monotony of misery.
No so Sir Angus Ferrern. A look of
unutterable pity crept into his eyes, a
note of intense sympathy into his
voice.
"And you are-"
"A widow, and a pauper, too."
She made a little gesture with her t
small, white hands; a gesture that in
vited inspection of her poor gown, of
her lack of jewels-and that told
more plainly than could a thousand I
words of genteel poverty and want
"Mlv poor Olivia," he said, and as
she glanced at him she saw tears on
his eye-lashes.
Lady Arlington grumbled next dcay
to her husband of Mlrs. Abinger's dull
ness and Sir Angus F'errers' silence.
But that long dinner was, in truth, h
nothing but a dream to the man and
woman who had parted with such
passionate tears fifteen years ago, and i
had met once again so unexpectedly.
Yet, though both dreamed, their
visions~ were so different. He, rich,
titled, still in the prime of manhood,
was absorbed in the dead past. If he
had been firm, if he had married
Olivia, how much unhappiness he
might have saved her, low rmucha
peace it would have brought to him p
self.
And Olivia dreamed only of a future
with the man whose imago had been m
ever in her heart, of Ea time of love and
joy, Sand freedom from sordid nuoney
troubles, and shabby frocks and semi- v
genteel lodgings. And so, except ;
when now'and then they exchanged
some conventfonal phrase, there was
silence between the two who had so ,
aulch to say.
Afterrlinner It seemed perfectlyzmat
ural to Oiviar Abinger that Sir Angus v
i.r~brs should seek her, and, :in y
It was she who talked the most; tell
Ing him of her great trials and disap.
pointments, dwelling on them with
g. the insistence of one who is drifting
3r towards happier things. He sat and
ig listened, and as he listened-looked;
ll and as he looked was conselious of a
4e vague thankfulness that he, still a
y_ young man, was bound by no altainto
ks the woman who sat before l~e. #He
or tried not to see the lines abbut' her
large, dark eyes, the dragged a#4iness
ig that marred the sweetness of. her
a, mouth. He knew intinctiidely-;hat
to her heart and her love were as fresh
l, as the first clay they were gfveiu to
him, but for the life of him-. he . aia4
ll not repress a guilty thankfulness that
I she was-only an old friend.
r By and by he rose to go, but held her
s- hand long in taking leave.
ly "N'ow that we have met again,
f; Olivia, we must not lose sight of one
ts another. When may I come and see
e- you?"
o She looked into his eyes anda happy
a smile curved the corners of her lips.
is "Whenever ycu please, Angus. Will
s, you come to-maorrow?"
e And he bowed low and left her be
ie hind the glowing lamp, her heart
n beating high in her bosom with the
m surety that to-morrow he would speak
-s and ask her to be his wife.
Lady Arlington's voice roused her.
y "Olivia, come out of your hiding
place at once. I want you to come to
Slurlingham next Saturday. Will yce?"
i, Olivia smiled a "yes," thinking n hat
d would any plans matter now. Afler
it to-morrow her life would be Angus' to
do with as he would. Most likely ho
would want her to go to some quiet
a river place, where they could be alone.
e In happy, dreamful silence she drift
,r ed across the great drawing-room to
,t ward the group gathered about Lady
k Arlington, who was chatting volubly
g to half a dozen women at once.
r "What did you think of Mira Bert
t- ram's hair? She changes the color
d every month, I declare. Lady Susan
t was quite angry about it; but then,
1 you know, she thinks it quite indecent
l to touch up at all. I was so awfully
vexed, by the way, that Lady Ferrers
couldn't come. She's quite pretty, and
her gowns-all fresh, of course, for
e she's only a bride-are so very smart."
s "Lady. Ferrersl Is Sir Angvs mar
a ried?"
Olivia Abinger did not know whether
she or another asked the question. She
a only waited for the answer.
"Oh, yes; six weeks ago. She's such
Sa clear little thing, and so nice. Her
father's place matches with his own in
f Scotland."
Olivia Abinger did. not cry out or
faint, though the shattering of her
Sdream and the breaking of her heart
were beyond all mortal agony. She said:
"Good night," and drove in a frowsy
four-wheeler to her shabby lodgings.
Still silent, still enduring, she went
upstairs to her little eittin--roonm; but
when she had lit the gas it flared upon
a face marked by the anguish of a life
time.
She stood by the table, her hands
hanging at her sides, her eyes, which
could not weep, staring before her.
"Married! rich! happy! While I, 1
who have hoped and longed and loved,
am-"
She flung her white arms above her
head, and a great cry rent her throat- I
a cry of all a woman's pent-up passion,
of all a heart's bitter disappoi;ttment.
"It is too much," she cried aloud to
the shabby walls and cheap ft.crniture;
"I cannot bear it. To-night I have c
dreamed of other things. I cannot go
back to the old ways. My heart is t
dead within me--dead." t
She paused; a gray shadow stole over
her drawn face, a somber fire burned
in her eyes. For a moment she disap- t
peared into her bedroom, ther returned I
to where the gas flared. She looked C
about her and, with the careful method
of a poor woman, picked up her cloak a
from the floor and folded it away on a 8
chair. Then she lowered the gas to
the blue and flung open the window.
"I want my soul to be free to go to
him if it can," she murmured, leaning
out over the street. "This will un
loose my bonds-and bring me peace v
and rest, and, perhaps, a little sigh of
regret from him."
With cold white fingers, that yet did
not tremble it their ta-:k, she drew the
stopper from a tiny phial she held in
her hand. A thick, sweet odor as of
almond flowers floated through the Y
room. It dominated the faint per
fume that breathed.from Olivia's gown ti
and fair hair, and even tainted with
its insidious savor the outer air. With o:
dilated nostrils she caught the subtle Ce
scent and smiled a little. "Peace-and
regret-and remembrance," she sighed, b,
then raising her hand to her lips, with a
one movement of her slender throat 0]
she swallowed the few drops of liquid PJ
contained in the small blue bottle.
l1er hand dropped heavily on the win- ti
dowsill and her fingers relaxed. c
The tinkle of fallen glass rose from hi
the pavement below. di
hhe fell upon her knees before the hi
open window and raised her ashen face IO
to the star-lit heavens. dc
Iler fingers twitched in agony above Fi
her bursting heart; her pale lips strug
gled to cry but once to the man who,
for the second time, bad plunged her
into the darkness of despair. W
Int only a whisper came from her it
burning throat and poor, twisted r
mouth. nc
"Angus-my love-pray for me-re- th

* In-building a, permanent leqp barn
a there are several -things to be bonsid
to ered.
Ee The location should be-high anr) dry,
Ler facing the south, if possilie, where
as plenty of good, dry yard room can be
er had.
at The building must beco constructed
sb as to be free from dampness, drafts
to and foul air.
4 A very good barn for 10fO sheep of
at medium size may bebniu thirty by
fifty feet, either witV* stome or byic
cr basement, all above "ground, not -less
than eight feet high iw the clear (and,
n, better, nine or ten), with m$tiiy large
me windows near the top, so arasnged as
ee to open and close easil3,ndw.vith
three doors ten feet wideW-ile sthi
PY side. These will allow teams and
wagons to pass in and out-n hauling
LI out the manure, and should be pt
wide open,.except in stormy 'veather
'- and when the Wind blkmws in.
rt The barn above may .beasixtedh to
7e twenty feet high, and can easily be
bk filled with hay from an'end dtbriby
means of a hay fork and track.
We have two such barns-one thirty
I- by forty that accommodates eighty
to large breeding ewes, another thirty
?" by sixty-four. We are often asked
it
y
it
or GROUND PLAN OF SHIEEP BABN.
why we did not build them wider. I
answer that fifteen feet on each side
is tr enough to move the hay dropped
in the center, and a wider barn would
be harder to ventilate. Our hay doors
h are in the end, are twelve feet wide by
r fourteen feet high, and hung at the
bottom on heavy hinges, have a staple I
and ring near the top on the inside to
which a rope is attached to fasten to
r the hay-carrier to lower and raise the a
door as needed.
Where stone and brick are scarce
and expensive, the barn can be all
frame except a foundation, which
s hould be as high as the manure is al
lowed to accumulate.
a Twenty-four-foot posts can bo used 1
e and the first eight feet taken for the 1
sheep stable and the balance used for I
s the hay barn. If ensilage is wanted it
h can be built longer, and as much at a
one end used for a silo as is necessary I
to supply the flock with a succulent
ration each day.
It is a good plan to build in the form r
r of an l,, as this gives shelter from the
prevailing winds, yet there is one ob
jection to this-lack of yard room.
The thirty by fifty-foot barn with
three wide doors can be divided into
three apartments, with long feed rael s,
or with movable panels of fence where
the round racks are used. 'Pivo or
S three hay chutes should run up through
the cen:erof the barn; these should be
rhoarded up, with doors on sides that
I should be kept shut when not feeding;
these act as ventilators and should
pass up to the ventilatorsin the upolas
on the roof of the barn.
To illustrate the ground plan eaf such 2
a barn I give the accompanyiag dia- ti
gram. S
A A A: Compartments of ba'n six. ix
teen and two-thirds by thirty feet. fl
JR B 3. Yards thirty by sixty feet. r,
(The middle one will be as much less r,
sixty feet long as is taken off for path- ti

ten feet.)
C C C. Doors of barn ten feet wide
D DD D. Gates to yards.

F F. Chutes for hay and ventilator.
G. Well or watering trough for all

H H. Better place for watering

I I I. Round feeding racks if panels
of movable fence are used to form the
compartments.
In stormy and windy weather this
barn should be closed on the side oi
sides from which the storm comes and fr
opened on the opposite sides, giving ti
plenty ef fresh air at all times. b
Our thirty by forty foot barn men- a3
tioned above, with eight and a-half rc
foot stone basement and sixteen foot
hay barn above, sided with matched
dressed sheeting, cost us about four
hundred dollars, and one ten feet
longer could be built for five hundred 51
dollars or less.-Oeorge MicKerrow, in

Do the Beees eed Salt?
On account of the avidity with in
which bees take salt, I had supposed t
it as necessary to salt my horses, hogs hi
and cattle, says a writer. If one does
not keep a salt trough for the bees fa
they are apt to swarm about his stock hi
and well troughs and many are T
drowned; but so long as salt water is as
given them they do not go or bother to
anywhere else. Where there amre
streams or ponds convenient, bees, pr
especially if not salted, will resort b ea
these for vatel! ·but even there are th
certain spots that seem to yield min"
eral or brackish water they go to th
suck. This shows their need of some
