THE CHEAT OF OVERCAPI
TALIZATION.

earned. So Mr. Morgan was liberal
in handing it out. The principle upon
which he proceeded was thus ex
plained by an admirer: “In reor
ganizing a road Mr. Morgan takes
care to cut down fixed charges to an
amount within the minimum earning
power. After that is accomplished
everybody can pretty much help him
self.”
In defending the capitalization of
the hard-coal roads in 1901, Mr. Mc-
Leod pointed out that four of them—
namely, Reading, Erie, New York, On
tario & Western, and Lehigh Valley—
had outstanding $382,554,000 of stock
upon which no dividend had ever been
paid and which had a merely nominal
value in the market.
So, if this was water, who was hurt
by it —no dividends being paid and
the stuff being of little value? Why
bother about the old-rags heap? But
today dividends are paid upon all of
this stock with the exception of Erie
common. Last year the prospect of
a dividend on Erie common seemed
so bright that the stock sold at above
SSO a share, while Reading’s watered
common sold at $164 a share.
The Baltimore & Ohio and the Lake
Shore roads have jointly bought over
sixty million dollars of Reading stock,
out of a total of $140,000,000 —there-
by passing it on toward a form of
capitalization with fixed charges. The
New York, New Haven & Hartford
has bought $29,000,000, or one-half,
of the common stock of the New
York, Ontario & Western, thereby
putting it also in the way of becom
ing a form of capitalization bearing
fixed charges—for these purchases by
one road of the stock of another are
generally financed in the end by an
issue of bonds.
The Loot in Union Pacific.
How could all this watered stock
be so handsomely supported and be
come so agreeably valuable unless the
railroads were charging the public
for coal and for transportation much
more than enough to yield a reason
able return upon the actual invest
ment?
It is true, as Mr. Stickney says*
that the average investor in railroad
securities gets only a moderate retur.i.
The railroad monopolizes the com
modity and charges more for it than
it is fairly worth; it issues four per
cent stocks and bonds to the full
amount that the monopolistic earning
power will support, and sells them to
the public; then it argues that the
charges can not possibly be too high
because the investor is getting only
3.65 or 3.02 per cent.
After the Credit Mobilier scandal,
Congress investigated the Union Pa
cific and found that it had cost the
contractors a little under $51,000,000
to build the road.
For this there was issued,
$ 27,000,000 Government Subsidy
Bonds
27,000,000 First Mortgage Bonds
18,000,000 Land Grant and Income
Bonds
36,000,000 Common Stock
$108,000,000
The government and first-mortgage
bonds covered the cost of building the
line. The other 54,000,000 of securi
ties represented profits. Presently
Jay Gould took a hand in Union Pa-
cific. He controlled the Kansas Pa
cific and Denver Pacific, which to
gether had $25,000,000 of common
stock—all water and of little current
value. He persuaded the directors
of Union Pacific to buy these lines
and to exchange Union Pacific stock
at par for their bogus shares.
Overloaded Union Pacific went into
bankruptcy in 1893, and was reorgan
ized. Holders of the old bonds re
ceived in most eases par in new four
per cent bonds with a bonus of fifty
per cent in new preferred stock.
There was issued $75,000,000 of new
preferred stock, practically all of
which was given in bonuses to the old
security holders and to the reorganiza
tion syndicate. The $61,000,000 of
old common stock was converted into
the same amount of new common.
Dividends of ten per cent a year are
now paid on this new common stock.
Some part of this is due to Mr. Har
riman’s brilliant speculations in the
stock of other roads. The rest of it
is due to a heavy traffic carried at
rates higher than would yield a fair
return upon the investment. Inci
dentally, the road received the gift of
an empire in public lands. The moiety
remaining unsold at the time of the
reorganization was valued at $13,-
358,500.
The Northern Pacific fared even
better in this regard. The govern
ment gave it 40,000,000 acres of pub
lic lands—a piece of generosity which
in no wise restrained the stock-water
ing proclivities of the builders and re
organizers.
Northern Pacific’s Water Cure.
The road has been reorganized
three times, and is now capitalized at
more than $65,000 a mile, excluding
the bonds that it issued jointly with
the Great Northern to pay for Chi
cago, Burlington & Quincy stock. Ca
nadian Pacific is capitalized at only
$29,000 a mile. Northern Pacific’s
funded debt per mile, excluding the
Burlington bonds, is greater than the
entire capitalization per mile of the
Canadian road. To understand how
Northern Pacific’s capitalization has
been boosted to this figure we need
only glance at the last reorganization.
There were $42,000,000 of first-mort
gage bonds outstanding. In the reor
ganization each SI,OOO bond received
$1,350 in new prior lien bonds; all
second and third mortgage bonds re
ceived 118 1-2 per cent of face value
in new prior lien bonds, 50 per cent
face value in preferred stock.
Each SI,OOO bond received $1,685
in new securities.
The old stock, practically all water,
was exchanged for new stock of the
same amount.
The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
has been reorganized twice. In the
last reorganization the old general
mortgage 4 per cent bonds received
75 per cent in new general mortgage
4’s, 40 per cent in new adjustment 4’s.
Thus $129,320,770 was converted into
$148,718,983 in new 4 per cent. Old
second mortgage “A” bonds received
113 per cent in new preferred stock;
second mortgage “B” bonds received
118 per cent in new preferred stock.
Os the “A” and “B” bonds there
were $87,937,500 outstanding, and
they drew four per cent a year in
terest. The holders paid in a cash as
sessment of four per cent, and re
ceived $99,869,375 of new preferred
stock which draws five per cent a year
in dividends. The old common stock,
about all water and of very little
3effersonlan.
value at the time of the reorganiza
tion, was exchanged for the same
amount —$102,000,000 —0 f new com
mon stock. This new common stock
now draws five per cent a year in
dividends, and until the recent de
plorable slump in stocks it sold above
par.
They will tell you that it would not
be fair to squeeze out the water in a
reorganization. For example, a great
many small investors had bought
Union Pacific, Northern Pacific, and
Atchison stocks during boom times.
Times turned bad. The roads could
no longer carry the overcapitalization
and the profitless branch lines with
which financial geniuses had loaded
them. Bankruptcy followed. But the
small, innocent investors must not be
frozen out. They must be permitted
to exchange their old stock for new,'
and so given a chance to recoup when
good times come again. Such is the
argument.
As a matter of fact, it doesn’t work
that way. The ordinary innocent
investor gets frightened when he .
sees the road approaching insol
vency, and dumps his stock on a fall
ing market for what little it will
fetch; or he is pinched in his own
small business and has to sell; or he
can’t pay the assessment. In any
event, he throws over the stock. The
opulent “reorganization syndicate”
or individual financiers scoop it in.
Thus Kuhn-Loeb and their reorganiz
ing associates, including Harriman,
emerged from the Union Pacific reor
ganization with great blocks of the
stock, which they had taken in at bot
tom prices. Northern Pacific reor
ganization landed almost half the
stock in the hands of Morgan, Hill,
and their crowd.
Always Wall Street Wins.
After the panic of 1893, about thirty
thousand miles of road underwent re
organization. One might mention Bal
timore & Ohio, in which old first per
ferred stock got 52 1-2 per cent of
face value in new preferred and 75
per cent in new common; the old
second preferred received 20 per cent
in new preferred and 150 per cent in
new common; and the old common got
20 per cent in new preferred and 100
per cent in new common. The gen
eral effect of the reorganization was
to infiinite further capitalization that

operators. Os course, the syndicates
and the operators have since, in many
cases, sold out the stocks, to their own
vast profit. If ever hard times come
again, or other conditions arise that
