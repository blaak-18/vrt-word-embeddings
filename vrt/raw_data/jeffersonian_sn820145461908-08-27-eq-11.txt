Heart
Troubles
The heart may be weak
just the same as the eyes,
stomach or other organs.
It often happens that a
person is born with a weak
heart. Then again dis
ease, fevers, over-exertion,
anxiety, nervousness,
rheumatism, etc. weaken
the heart. The result is
shortness of breath, pal
pitation, pain in the heart,
or in some of the nerves
of the chest or abdomen.
The heart should be
strengthened with a tonic,
and for this nothing equals
Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure.
“I had LaGrippe last fall as I
thought in a mild form. I was weak
tired feeling, and short of breath;
could hardly go about, and a good
deal of the time sort of an asthmatic
breathing and extremely nervous. I
began taking Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure
and Nervine and now I feel so much
better In every way. I am so thank
ful that I began taking this medicine,
and shall not hesitate to tell others
how much good it has done me.”
MRS. F. J. NORTON,
Freeville, New York.
Your druggist sells Dr. Miles’ Heart
Cure, and we authorize him to return
price of first bottle (only) if It fails
