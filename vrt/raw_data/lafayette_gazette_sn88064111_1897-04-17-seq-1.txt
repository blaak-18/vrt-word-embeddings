THE BONDS
The Supreme Court Decides
the Act of the Legisla
lature is not Legal.
An Amendment to the
Charter of the Town
May Be Necessary.
The Supreme Court has decided
that the Legislative act authorizing
the town of Lafayette to issue bonds
is unconstitutional. This decision
will naturally cause delay in the
building of the waterworks and
electric light plaints. When the
act was passed by the Legislature
and Contractor Ferguson's attorneys
questioned its validity some emin
ent lawyers expressed the opinion
that it was constitutional while
other attorneys of equal promin
ence did not think it would stand
the judicial test. But the City
Council wisely concluded to ap
peal to the courts for light. Now
that it is settled that the Legislature
had no constitutional power to
confer upon the town the authority
to issue bonds, it will be in order
to adopt other means by which the
desired end can be attained. There
seems to be no doubt that the peo
ple can amend the'charter of the
town, authorizing the City Council
to issue bonds. Should this be
done it will not be necessary to
apply to the Legislature or to
any other body for permis
sion or authority. The town of
Franklin being confronted with the
same condition of affairs that exists
here, held an election at which an
amendment to the charter was sub
mitted to a popular vote. The de
cision of the Supreme Court having
established the illegality of the
bonds the best way out of the tem
porary embarrassment seems to be
an amendment to the charter, by
which the town will be clothed with
the authority to issue bonds for the
purpose of building the proposed
plants.
The Grandest Remedy.
Mr. R. B. Greeve, tuerchant, of
Chilhowie, Va., certifies that he
had consumption, was given up to
die, sought all medical treatment
that money could procure, tried all
cough remedies he could hear of,
but got no relief; spent many nights
sitting up in a chair; was induced
to try Dr. King's New Discovery,
and was cured by use of two bot
ties. For past three years has been
attending to business, and says Dr.
King's New Discovery is the grand
est remedy ever made, as it has
done so much for him and also for
others in his community. Dr.
King's New Discovery is.guaranteed
for coughs, colds and consumption.

Rayne's New Ginnery.
Rayne will soon boast of one of
the finest cotton ginning plants ever
erected in this section. It will be
owned and operated by the Rayne
Ginning Company, limited, and is
equipped with the Smith Sons'
pneumatic system, using three
seventy-saw gins. It is to be
built on new ideas and far in ad
vance of the old way of ginning
cotton. The plant will be com
pleted in about thirty days, after
which time Chappuis & St. John,
of Rayne, La., agents.for the Smith
system, will take pleasure in show
ing it to persons interested, and
if you contemplate buying a new
gig or gin plant and are unable to
call in person, a letter of inquiry
will bring you full information.

HOLY WEEK
At St. John's Church
A Suceesful Mission
Concluded.
Father Knapp's eloquent sermon
at the Catholic church last Sunday
was a fitting close ot one of the
most successful missions ever held
in Lafayette. For two weeks the
learned Dominican preached an
average of two sermons a day and
upon every occasion the church
was literally packed with people.
The reverend father has certainly
done good work for the holy cause
during his stay in Lafayette, and
those who had the good fortune to
listen to his intelligent discourses
wish to have an apportunity to hear
him again.
Palm Sunday was celebrated with
usual brilliancy at the Catholic
church. As is customary the:bless
ing of palms took place. The sing
ing by the choir, under the direc
tion of Miss E. Mouton, was parti
cularly effective.
Every day of the Holy Week
men, women and children could be
seen wending their way toward St.
John's church, where could be no
ticed at all hours a goodly number of
persons in silent contemplation.
On the evenings of Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday the chanting
of the Tenebrae took place. This
ceremony is so called on account
of the darknesswhich prevailed over
the earth when Christ was on the
cross.
On Thursday modrning at 9
o'clock solemn high mass was said.
On the morning of Good Friday
there was no real sacrifice of the
mrss and no consecration of host
wine. At this service the clergy in
bare feet kiss the feet of the un
covered- crucifix. During the day
until late in the evening a con
course of people could be noticed
coming and going to kiss the feet
of the Crucified Savior. A very
instructive sermon on the passion
by the erudite Jesuit, Father De
Stockhalper, concluded the exer
cises of Good Friday.
Saturday there will be services at
8 o'clock in the morning. The last
portion of the day will be devoted by
the priests to the hearing of con
fessions.
To-morrow, Easter, the ceremo
nies will be performed with usual
solemnity. High mass will be said
at 9 o'clock. A collection for the
seminary will be made, and after the
religious ceremonies the sale of pews
wi.l take place.

The Railroad Agent at New Iberia
Went to the Assistance of a
Little Orphan Girl.
While it may be said with good
reason that railroad corporations
have ,no souls it must not be in
ferred from that generally accepted
truth that railroad men have no
hope of a future existence. Em
ployes of railway companies are
very often wrongfully accused "of
being unkind and discourteous.
While this charge is well-founded
in some cases in others it is abso
lutely unjust and undeserved.
Last Monday when the west
bound train stopped at New Iberia
a small crowd of people.was no
ticed standing near the gateman
Iwho was handed the following
paper by a little girl who was ac
companied by an elderly looking
lady:
To Conductors, Trainmen and Sta
tion Agents:
This is Lena Story, an orphan
child from Abbeville, La. She is
coming to this station (Arcadia,
La.) via. Alexandria and Shreve
port. La. Please give her special
care and atte'stion on train and at
transfer points, and oblige yours
truly, etc. S. G. BOYD,
Arcadia, La.
As the poor little girl had no
ticket and depended upon this
,paper to carry her through, she was
denied admission by the gateman
who was only performing his duty
as he understood it, and the unfor
tunate child was about to be left at
New Iberia. Some good-hearted
man offered to take charge' of her
and was walking away with her, but
when Mr. A. C. Pickett, the rail
road agent at New Iberia, was told
of the inability of the friendless lit
tle stranger to continue her journey
to where she expected to meet some
relatives, he immediately bought a
ticket for her. The face of the
little girl brightened up and the two
tears which had moistened her ruby
cheeks soon gave place to a smile of
contentment and happiness.
The child was helped aboard the
car and when the train left the
station she- was in charge
of the lady who had kindly
consented to take care of
her and see that no harm befell
her.
To The Gazette reporter the lady
said that Lena Story was fiom
Abbeville where her mother died a
few days ago.
If any one has a watch that fails
to give satisfaction, he should take
It to T. M. Biossat. He employs
skilled workmen.

It Was Not Dominick.
A trio of peripatetics appeared
before the mayor last Monday on a
charge of being suspicious'and dan
gerous. As O'Malley was the name
of one of them, the mayor did not
think it safe to release him without
further investigation, but as the poor
fellow assured him that he was not
Dominick O'Malley and that he was
not even remotely connected with
the .editor of the Item, he was lib
erated.
DR. W. D. MORTON,
Of the Mississippi Synod,
Preaches at the Presby
terian Church.
The Lafayette Presbyterian
church, has, within the last eight a
days, been blessed by the presence i
and work of a distinguished divine.
W. D. Morton, D. D., the eloquent
evangelist from the Mississippi a
Synod, held regular meetings twice t
a day, much to the edification and
enlightenment of this congregation
as well as those of other kindred
denominations. This gifted man of r
God pleaded in most eloquent and I
persuasive terms to all Christians to
live in accord with the sacred
teachings of their churches. The
different themes dwelt upon by Dr.
Morton were treated with surprising s
zeal, erudition and eloquence.
Last Sunday upon the subject of
the ten commandments he was
manifestly clear, explicit and im
pressive. He showed in what man
ner they are violated and the im
possibility of sinful man to live
without their violation-as the vio
lation of one embraces that of the
whole decalogue. And here he
spoke with special emphasis on the
power of God-saving grace to pro
cure and insure salvation to man.
The gift of the Holy Spirit to man
and His influence as guide and
comforter was a theme that he
strongly and happily dwelt upon.
There were many other themes
drawn from the holy scriptures
equally solemn and impressive, and
handled by Dr. Morton with equal
effectiveness.
The eloquent and forcible ser
mons of this distinguished clergy
man will be of signal and lasting
benefit to those who heard them.

New Buildings.
Several new buildings are going
up in Lafayette. Mr. W. H. Daily

seen fit to make a change in his
repair department and has secured
the services of Mr. D. Gordon
Hall, late of Houston, Texas, who
is a capable and skilled woriman.
So if any one in this town or sur
rounding country has any watches
that fails to give satisfaction, T.
M. Biossat's is the place to call.

J. D. Scott, a colored hypnotist
who hails from Galveston, was in
Lafayette this week anxious to per

city the orther day the dusky
professor of hypnotism put a
young negro to sleep alnd kept
him sleeping exactly 36 hours.
Scott gave an exhibition at one of
the negro churches.

Something to Know.
It may be worth something to
know that the very best medicine
for restoring 'the tired-out nervous
system to a healthy vigor is Electric
Bitters. This medicine is purely
vegetable, acts by giving tone to
the nerve centers in the stomach,
gently stimulates the liver and kid
neys, and aids these organs in
throwing off impurities in the blood.
Electric Bitters improves the appe
tite, aids digestion, and is pro=
nounced by those who have tried it
as the very best blood purifier and
nerve tonic. Try it. Sold for Soc
or $z.oo per bottle at Wm. Clegg's
drug store.

If the press cease to laud candi
dates because they are candidates
and will promptly and fearlessly re
fuse to assist by enconiums and
senseless adulations, such as editors
know to be unworthy; if it will be
true to its own great mission in as
serting and defending the best in
terests of the people, a mighty rev
olution can be effected in a short
time. The Progress has taken the
proper stand and we join in the de
sirable work and hope the entire
press of Louisiana will do likewise.

A FEW WORDS
Frpm a Progressive Firm
Who Will Speak to
the people
Of Lafayette Through the
Columns of The
Gazette.
On our fourth page appears the
half-page announcement of Mistrot
Bros. & Co. of New Iberia, a pro
gressive and wide awake firm who
means business and wants every
body to know it.
The members of this firm are not
unknown in this section, having
spent their childhood and early
manhood in New Iberia, where
their father was a successful mer
chant in ante as well as post-bellum
days. The entire family went to
Texas many years ago and engaged
in the dry goods business. Energy
and fair dealing brought success;
and to-day this firm is one of the
largest dealers in dry goods .in all
its branches in all the South.
They have an immense wholesale
house in Galveston from whence
they supply their large retail stores
situated at Houston, Marlin, Bryan,
Navasota, Mexia, Cuero, Hunts
ville, Brenham, Rockdale, Crock
ett, Palestine, Belton, La Grange,
and Waco, Texas.
We are told that the aggregate
sales of the retail houses is over
$t,ooo,ooo annually.
They buy direct from manufac
turers; they pay cash and discount
all bills, and when they receive a
consignment of goods, we can
readily believe that it comes to
them at as low price as it is possi
ble for such goods to be made.
They claim to retail goods at
wholesale prices, and they submit a
small list of prices as a sample of
what they are doing. Read the
list carefully, make comparisons
and judge for yourself. Their
mottoes are, "strictly one price"
and "'spot carh."
This firm opened its doors for
business in New Iberia on the 9th
of last June. They at once leaped
into popular favor, and now less
than one year since their advent to
this section, they are about to
move into larger quarters. The
new store which is being built
especially for them, is located on
Main street, a few doors east of the
post-office. They expect to oc
cupy it between May I and g. It
is a large building 6o feet wide by
zoo feet long, giving 6ooo square
feet of floor space. It will have
three large plate-glass show win
dows, and in every way is a
modern building.
Our sister city is fortunate in
securing such a progressive firm.
Their success proves that the peo
ple of Iberia, St. Martin and Ver
milion parishes appreciate a good
thing when they see it and always
"ush it along."
The Round Cotton Bale.
Southern Farmer.
The enormous loss incident to
the ordinary way of baling cotton,
while it seems largely unavoidable,
continues to attract attention and
to impress upon all thinking cotton
planters the imperative necessity of
some improvement, come along
what lines it may. At the recent
convention held at Waco, Texas,
the matter of the wastefulness of
the pressent system was thoroughly
discused and the inferiority of the
standard American package to the
competing Egyptian and India
bales was strongly brought out.
SThat a standard gin box should
be adopted seems to have been
generally assented to. The round
had its friends who thought it
would be the best. The uniformity
of size and binding that would fol
low its general adoption would ulti
mately give it a standing in the
market not now possessed by the
average bale, and would prevent
the waste of repeating sampling.
Its compactness and regularity of
pressure would keep fibre intact
and better, and would reduce to the
minimum the risk of damage by
water and dirt and loss by fire. Its
transportation would cost less than
now, as would also the covering.
