CONFEDE tl TE MEMORIAL DAY.
It may be of general interest to state
that at the reunion of the Confederate
Veterans held in Dallas last year it was
the sense of the majority that Confed
erate Memorial Day be observed
throughout the South on June 3, which
is the birthday anniversary of Jeffer
son Davis, President of the Confederate
States.
In Louisiana Memorial Day has been
observed on April 6, the anniversary of
the first day's battle of Shiloh, where
thousands of Louisianians yielded their
lives for the Cause which led them to
sacrifice the comforts and their loved
ones at home for the sanguinary field,
but while there was much to the credit
of State pride in such memorial celebra
tions, it was confined to within the ter
ritorial borders of Louisiana, as other
such events were limited to the States
in which glorious victories were won.
In fixing June 3 as the Confederate
Memorial Day, there will he given to
the event an historical connection, a
positive recognition of a man who as
the head of the Southern Confederacy,
represented in his personality as well as
in his official capacity all that which
was dear and must ever be sacred to the
South.
In response to the suggestions of the
Confederate Veterans in session at Dal
las, the General Assembly of Louisiana
has fixed June 3 as a legal holiday,
which will, beyond a doubt, be observed
not only in this §tate but throughout
the South, as a day when the people
may gather in their respective sections
and lay on the graves of the braves the I
floral tributes emblematic of their loy
alty to the departed, an emphasis of
their love for those who were near and
dear to them. Therefore, under the new[
order, Menmrial Day in Louisiana,will
not be celebrated on April 6.
DEMOCRATIC RULE.
* The Governor's only function, for
years has been to manipulate patronage
as a bribery fund.--Harlequiti.
This observation it more. forceful
than poetical. As the Cauasian' has de-i
clard frquently, the' GW eienor of .E
Louisiana is, vested, with -pwg power
thanastle Gov, nor;of, the: State of. Newi
Yoflrc. His power ,is autocratic. In othe

be nominated. In aipoltical sense he is
like he Irishman's. tttle whose head a

and to the end he bore his illness with
Christian fortitude. When stricken, the
deceased' was in the vigor of manhood.
He had been trained to business and
had filled cretifibly the office of vice
president of the Lee Hardware Com

severing and painstaking and valued his
good name beyond all glitter and price.
Duty was his guide. As a citizen he was
actively concerned in the progress and
development of the city in which he was
born and had been reared, 'and he never
neglected the discharge of all the re
sponsibilities which devolve on every
man, on public questions. As a son he
