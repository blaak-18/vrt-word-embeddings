The Old Oaken Barket.
The following ls reproduced In the
intereets of sanitary science, and to
show how it is possible to render the
ethics of engineering in versee: I
SAS REVISED AND EDITED BY A "SANITA
RIAN."
With what anguish of mind I remember I
may childhood,
Nle,.aled in the light of a knowledge
sinoe ganed;
The malarious farm; the wet, fungus
grown wildwood,
The ehills then eontracted that since
have remained;
The seemovered duck-pond; the pig
13tclos by it;
The dth where the sonrsmeling hnou-e
draleage fed;
The damp, shaded dwelling; the foul
barn.yard nilh it
But wors than il lhe was that temble
well,
And she old oaken bucket, the mold
crusted bucket,
The moes.eovered bucket that hung in
the well. I
Just think of it! Moss on the vessel t
that lifted
The water I drank in the days called to
mind
SE I knew what professors and scien
gtide gifted
Is the water of wells by analysis and,
The rotting wobd.fbre, the oide f iron, t
The aigee, the frog of unusual else,
The water-impure as the verses of By
ron
Are the things I remember with tea in
my eye.
And to tell the sad truth-though I shed b
der to think it
I considered that water uncommonly b
elar,
And often at noon, when I went to drink
it,
I enjoyed it as muooh a I now enJoy r b
Now ardest I selsed it with bads that 0
Andw q iato e e mud-covered bottom it
Then soon. with its nitrates and nitrites,
and slimy
With matter organic, it roes from the
well.
Oh I had I but realized, in time to avoid
them,- t
Thedange that lurked in that pestilent ti
draught, o
I'd have tested for organic germs, and -
destroyed them b
With potamic permanganate ere I had
quaaled; ,
Or, perchance, I'd have boiled it, and af
terwards strained it i
Through filters of charcoal and gravel Is
combined ;
Or, after distilling, condensed and re
ained it U
la frnau* MIsu n. I UA.S eIlIL iue- $
hind.
How little I knew of the dread typhoid
S fever
Whieh lurked in the water I ventured to a
drink;
But sinee I've become a devoted believer
la the teachin of seoience, I shadder to t
think. o
And now far removed from the scenes
I'm describing, . .
The story for warning to otherm Itel, b
As memory reverts to my youthful ia-t
bibing, .
An Ia ast the thought of that her.
Sible-wen,
And the old oaken bucket, the fungus- m
grown bucket
i bt the slop-bucket that hung in the a

were the James River, nigh hand unto
SOCity P'int, or whether it were Mobile
Bay, or whether Galveston Roads,
or where not, don't matter. Neither

were skipper of the craft I were in
were called Smith. Brown on Jones;
Sthe way I call him will be Ofarle, a
young chap and awful spooney uantc
a gal, she bein' a ship, with fore and
mizzen stump to'llua' maste, bound
to Havre with terbacker, not beln'
able to load alongside of the wharf
on account of draught and obliged to
drop down when half loaded to a
p'nt some four miles below, and in
satln' on goin' up every night to see
her, I beln' coxsewailn of tbh gig ud
frequent ke' waltla' till two bells of
the mornla watab afore he'd make
his appearance.
S"ows'ever, i happens, sir as men
will go free, and o fres under most I

and beyond temporary beguilemente
had 'soaped unharmed, spooey as he i
was; but here, In a little twopeany- i
ha' penny bit of a village, he come
athwart ais fate.
"We'd been a layin' there for a
week I suppose when away come a
bark to oad for Rilo. The sklpper
of her was'n't named Williams, whlob h
are why I calls him so, and him and ,
our old man they glts acquailted, d
and this here Williams he proposes t
to our old man for to go up to the
hotel and have a game o billiards.
"I've been here a week, ays our
old man, and.I don't believe as there ,
are ob a place.'
"'O, yes, there are' says this to* -

often heerd our old man telln theetory a

"'This don't look like a hotel,'
says our old man.
"Yes it are,' says tother sklpper a g

la country places like this they shut o
up early.'
"Well, there come a ltarky to the

bold as brass, and in he marched to y
a well.furnished parlor, followed by c
our old man a

chap begln for to be doubtful, but tI
both on 'em was completely flab b
bergasted When, arter waitn'l a half
hour, was there sailed into the room g
'two of the most beautiful oreeters.' t
so our old man always said when tel- c,
lin' the yarn 'as ever were seen.'
"Well sir, needn't for to tell that o

nor the tother skipper could say a s
