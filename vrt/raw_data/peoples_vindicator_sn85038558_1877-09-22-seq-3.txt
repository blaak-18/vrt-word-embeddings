Damage to Crops.-
The late rains have seriously dam- 1h
aged the crops, particularly the cot- w

was in poor plight to receive a beat- b

The price of corn is down lower is

ThIe graves of OUR DEA.D IiEROES
were tastefully decoratedn by loving
- hands on thire 14th. General Ogden
- was presented witih a very Ihanlrsome
1 sword, and addresses were delivered
- by Messrs. Lafitte, Roberts, Governor I
- Nicholls, and General Ogden. Thet
S)emor'crat Wvls read at every fire-side
iin this section on Tuesday night; r
i thie oli perused it withi tearful eye, 4
thie yonng listened with swelling a
Iheart, burning to emulate thieir exam- r
iple, trhe thlrilliingacount of hiow Lou
r isianian's died to save us.
A good story, rather a rehash
of an old one, ihowever, is told by e
a Tennessee "Confed," on "old r
Key" andt his conscript regiment.
I)uring the war he was ordered on x
t one occasion to the the front, and t
i it was, sO oUr informant says, the e
only occasion; discovering a line c
of the enemy, something like a
mile off, Keyes ordered his men k
to open on them. The Yankees g
stood thie annoyance until forbear
ance ceased to be a virtue, when
thie officer in command, rode over p
to the Grays, and demanded u
"who in the hell commands this j
layout I" Keyes Very luimidly re- t1
pilied he had that honor, but if ti
there was an harm done, he was
willing to apoilogize for it. "God rn
damn your soul" thundered the
Yanrkee Colonel, "if you hurt any tl
of my men with your damned
squibs, I'1 come over there and t
wear hell out of you with a club!" sr
Keys fled.
Ana now the telegrapher extracts
Hayes sweets from Governo" Nich
olls speech in presenting the sword
to General Ogden on thie 14th. If tihe
words "wisdom and patriotism" "ev
idently intend to personify Hayes"
then Governor Nicholls should be -
ashamed of hIimself for obtrading a
"fraud" into the general rejoicing of
a people over a virtuous action, and oh
upon thie occasion of presenting a
sword t~b a chivalrous, honest hlero. M
We don't believe Gov. Nichiolls meant
any such thing. ct
