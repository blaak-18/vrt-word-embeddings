The sugia planteis of this parish
in forming a new party declared it
to be a white party, and that no
Loom existed in it for the hegroe.
They maintain that they carri&d St.
Mary in x896 by a white majority,
And that they still pjossets that ma
jority. In behalf of the Democra
cy of St. MafJr ie ehallenge them
to put this claim to the test and
hmike the cdtting contest a white
one. Let both sides refrath ffom urg
ing the negro to register or to vote,
and let the party most strong
ly entrenched in the hiarts of St.
Mary's white thiiien:s win the day.
A refusal to meet the white issue
Will be accepted by the entire par
ish to be ~ii dcknowledgemnent by
the leaders of the Planter Itepub
lican party that their tioasted white
mnajoiity is but a myth and that
their party is virtually a negro party
with white leaders. and that they
dare not submit their views to
white mer. for settlement.-St. Ma' j
Kanner, riem.
tht fact that only 960 voters
registeied ih this parish is being
Commented upon by the pfess
throughout the Stgte. They speak
Of it as if all those fitted to register
had done so, with the wonderful
fesuilt that out of 8ooo males over
the age of a r, less than a thousaind
Could fill a registration blank.
'This is not a fact, and the Clarion
thought that it had fully explained
the combination of causes that lead
to so few registering. St. tandry
tan make a better showing than
that, and the next registration will
trove it. -- St. Landry Clarion,

Our contetmiporaries throughout
the State Mre beginning to:l discuss
the question of holding the consti
tucional cdliaention. This matter
is a very important one to the
State, as the contention will under
take to remodYb the present organic

aftaid, however, that under the
present deihoralized condition of
affairs in our State there will be
very little improvement 0d the dtl
stitution Wi now have. jut, r6

Theni again, a belief is gaining
ground in the United Stated Uo
abolishing the death penalty. And
we would not be surprised if this
vefy belief refe not thie giliding
star of the judge whose unwarrant
able leniency upon the bench has
also done much for mob law. - We
see no use in any State endeavorfitg,
throtigh its judicial authorities, to
reconriile the people to the abolition
of the death penalty, when they ie
fuse to b feicotidiled to the tune of
lynching every critiiinal or supposed
criminal that they can get their
hands cih. if the Louisiana Legis
latufe ~oiidd all of a sudden wipe
out the death penalty, and the peo
ple wrtilld find themselves oipposed
to it, the same or a subsequent
Legislattif iirould be compelled to
feinstitute it as a means of abolish
ing revolution. The people seldoni
willingly receive that which they do
iiot waiit, and it can be easily seen
that they sifonglry favor the punish
ment of death. So long as con
scientious sctuples against capital
punishment tail to disquaiify the
juror in this State, as the law is to
day, and so long, too; as men ire
permitted to be sworn in uipori the
fury who do not possess education
enough to reason out the difference
In the degrees of crime of which the
accused can be convicted under the
Same indictment, or who hatie not
sumicieenf Common or moral sense to
feel the difference between right
and wrong in their own bosoms, so
long as the jury is held in disrespect
and often contempt by the masses,
because of their low moral or intel
lectual degree; that long will the
people administer the law by their
owirn hands. And even longer than
this.-Franklin News, Ind.
