District Court.
The District Court is still in see
*'sion. There were during the first
2 weeks of the term 46 convictions
of which but a very small percent
age were for felonies. Of whicl
weri thie Braxtou brothers, Ruben
A V'Pete and John (col.) who were con
'- victed of cutting with intent t(
"; kill, and that of Jos. Valsin (col.
is. charged with the murder of Majoi
- Andre (col.) in ward 3, last August.
The adduitional cases were:
James Farrell larceny.
Ly" Geogre Benjamin, shooting with
intent to kill.
Las St. A Felix, cutting with intent
to kill.
Joe Phillips, cutting with intent
to kill (sentenced to three years in
the penitentiary.)
Frank Smith, cutting with intent

Win. Morris, Geo. Lewis, Peter
F"ehlers, Hamp Fobb, larceny.

Pierce Lynch, larceny.
Henry Stewart, Manslaughter.
George Peabody.
Elsewhere in this issue will be
found a circular addressed to school
officers throughout the South, by
('ol. Thos. D. Boyd, President of
the Louisiana State Normal School.
The object of this circular is to
put on foot a movement to celo
brate, in a deserving manner, the
centennial anniversary of the birth
of the South's great benefactor,
n George Peabody. This movement
is one that should attract the sym
- pathy and enlist the support of
every citizen of the South. The
celebration of this day should not
be confined to schools. There is
not a man, woman or child in the
South who has not been benefitted,
directly or indirectly, by the mu
nificent gift of this great philan
thropist. It is, therefore, meet
and proper that our people in every
avenue of life should join hands to
t make the 18th of February, 1895,
a red-letter day in the history of
our Southland.
It has been truly said that "The
best study of mankind is man;"
and it might be as truly said that
"The best study for mankind is
ºman," when the subject possesses
the noble attributes of the great
and good man whose name heads
this article. In doing honor to
this patriot, we not only give ex
pression to one of the noblest
qualities of which man is capable,
gratitude; but, by thus honoring
him, we serve to - upon the
youth of our land s of great
and lasting benefit.
No worthier object ever appeal
ed to the support of the Press,
and we hope to see our brothers
all over the South take up this
matter and push it to a suoesusful
termination.
At a regular meeting of the City
Council the following committees
were appointed to serve du
ring the ssion of the Agricultu
ral Society on January 2, 24, and

A number of young folks met

months, visiting friends and rela- I
id tives. We wish them a pleasant
trip.
The Goddess of Harvest has
showered her richest blessings in
our section for the crops have been
) of the best this year, but low
ol prices have somewhat discouraged
'y the farmers, yet we can but hope
)f that the future will bring brighter
1. prospects.
to Be sure and attend the Minstrels
©- and Elocution Entertainment next
ue week. You will have one of the
;h nicest times of your life. The
r, Minstrel troupe is composed of the
it best talent in this section, and as
i- the admission is in the reach of
if. all, the young men should be en
e couraged by a large attendance.
it The Recital and Elocution enter- a
s tainment is under the skillful man
e agement of those popular ladies B
I, Mrs. C. Myers, and Miss Eva Mc- a
Cain, and as they need no intro
duction at our hands, it goes with
t out saying that the entertainment
y will be like others given by them
o in the past-a grand success.
Times are hard, but our mer- V
chants are selling their Holiday a
goods so cheap that their custo- f
mere don't feel them.
Mr. H. Braswell, a pleasant and
popular young man from Simsbo
ro, La., is spending the Holidays
with us, guest of Mr. G. L Ethe
aridge.
"Fly time" still clings to us like J
grim death to a dead dog. Noa
money at all now, and prospects is
for much less in the near future. r
Mrs. Sarah Hyde, the wife of e
Hartwell Hyde, a respectable old t
citizen of this place, met with the fe
serious accicent of breaking her ti
leg just above the ankle, this hap
pened a few days ago, and the es- w
timable old lady is now confed to
her bed, but doing as well as could J
br expected.
Mrs. Mary E. Christy, who for *
a long time resided near this place,
dklid at the home of her son, Mr.
T. W. Christy, in Winn parish,
and was buried here by the aide of
her husband, Mr. James Christy,
on Friday, the 14th inst.
Capt. . M. Sharpe, mar this

some time, but to the delight of
his many friends, is now eonva- 0

Hon. Sam. C. Curry, an old
and esteemed citizen of this place, t
is now very sick, but his many Je
fajinds are hopeful that he may
soon recover. a.
The marriage bells are ringing

PERSONAL MMNTION.
- Gen. J. H. Cosgrove paid us an
. appreciated call this week. lie
r was just in from his plantation,
e where he says he has been wrest
ct ling with the knotty problem of
' paying a $4O debt with a $20 bale
1e of cotton, and it gave him a touch
i of Rheumatism, and he had not
i- solved the problem yet.
I)r. ll'y McCain and E. W.
Teddlie of St. Maurice, were con
j pelled to spend two or three days
in town this week, as witnesses in
an important case.
Messrs. E. P. Martin, M. E.
a and Andrew Jackson, of Winn
i parish, were in town this week.
The Worchester (Mass.) spY has
the following: Many Northwes
tern farmers have become thor
oughly tired of enduring the trials
to which their uncertain climate
subjects them and are turning their
eyes toward the South as the land
of promise. A. large number of
Nevada stock farmers and dairy
men are preparing to move to
t North Carolina and purchase farms
in localities suited to their avoca
tions.
A CARDB.
EmTron POPULIST :-As I have been
asked several questions regarding the
indictment of Henry Bier for perjury,
and as there seems to be an impression
abroad that the indicted person is Mr.
Henry Beer, I desire to state that this is
not Mr. Henry Beer of the firm of II. &
B. Beer, New Orleans, who has large
interests in the Natchitoches and Red
River Valley Railway Co. It can be
readily seen that the names are spelled
differently.
