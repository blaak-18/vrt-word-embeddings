KNAPP THE MURERER
He Confessea to Having Committed
Some Other Deeds.
CAREER OF CRIMINAL
The Kan Statsl That He Had ile
peatedly Criminally Asiaulted
Women, Saying Hle Could
Not Resist Desire.
Hamilton 0.. Feb. 27.-After con.
fessing that he had k:fled five womeu
Albert A. Knapp admitted he had re
peatedly assaulted women criminally
and killed some of them. He said hs
met the Littleman child in the lumo
her yard and assaulted her and chok
ed her to death when she made an out
cr.
He said: "I went to the room with
the Eckert girl, sat down with her and
assaulted her. She cried and I strang
led her with a towel and hurried from
the house.
"I was mad at my wife, Jennie Con.
nons Knapp, when I killed her. We
were walking along Liberty street. I
got her down under the bridge on a
pretext and choked her to death I
deny that I poisoned her. I never told
anyone I did. After she was dead I
threw the body into the canal.
"Ida Gebhart I killed, but my memr
ory is not clear as to what I did.
"I cannot tell what made me kill
these people. I could not help it. Some
kind of a desire to kill took hold of
me and I could not resist the tempta
tion to kill. I am sorry for my crimes
but now I hope they will be easy with
me."
After the confessions a formal cha-ge
of murder in the first degree was filea.
Knapp talks much of the Pearl
Bryan murder and is afraid of being
lynched. "He does not want to be taken
from the county jail.
Until prevented by his attorneys it
is expected that Knapp will make
further confessions. He is now sus
pected of strangling three women at
Evansville. Ind., and to have assault
ed and killed women elsewhere. He
was in the Cincinnati house of refuge
when seventeen years of age and tlew
records are being discovered almost
hourly.
Says He Is Insane.
Cincinnati, Feb. 27.-Tlhe parents of
Knapp said Albert was insane and his
confession should not he believed.
They believed he would be better
dead. Mrs. Sadie Wenzel,~ his sister,
said her brother, when five years of
age, was kicked by a colt at Twenty
Mile Prairie, Ills., and lat sr struck by
lightning at Terre Haute and but for
her pareats she would have had him
adjudged Insane.

covered consciousness, the robbers de
mabded $20,000 which they said they
knew was secreted in the house. When
told that no such amount was there.
the bandits applied burning torches
to the face and feet of all, blistering
even the infant's little feet. Christian
Joertin, an aged paralytic, was beaten
so severely that there is not a spot on
his head that is not bruised and raw.
The marauders before leaving securely
tied their victims and searched every

Continues Alarming.

and pouring lava, are seeking refuge
in distant towns and villages.
The city of Tuxpan, in the state of
Jalisco, continues under a heavy
cloud of smoke. The volcano is alight
with flames. An Amerian who slept
near the volcano on the night of the
eruption was awakened by a tremen
dous explosion and saw the mountain
ejecting flames to an enormous height.
He awaited till morning enjoying the
magnificent spectacle and then deemed
it prudent to leave the vicinity.

SCHAT ABOUT AUTHORS.
The Creator of "Mrs. Wiggs" Xar.
ries-A Story About Riley.
[Special Correspondence.]
New York. Feb. 9.--Mrs. Alice tHem.
Rice, the author of the new book,
"Lovey Mary," and of "Mi. Wigas o!
the Cabbage Patch," wrote the latter,
her first book, under her naidin name,
Alice Caldwell Iigan. She is the
daughter of Mr. and 'MrsW.S. N. :legan
of Louisville, Ky. As _MiSs M11egani she
was for a long; time interested in the
people of the "po' white" quarters of
Louisville. There she found her char
acters. The sale of "Mrs. \Wigs of the
Cabbage Patch" has boen very large;
in fact, it has exceeded that of any oth
er book ever issued by the Century
company. During the three weeks pre
ceding Christmas +;2,.0C0 copies were
sent out by the publishers, and even
after the holidays were over the sale
was averaging 1,000 and 2,000 a day.
Here are some gems of epigram
culled from books of the hour:
Popularity-it is a shadow! Turn
your eyes toward it, and it shall ever
run before you, escaping you. Turn
your back upon it, walk religiously to
ward the living sun, and it shall fol
low you.-Jerome K. Jerome in "Paul
Kelver."
There is no fatalism like that of the
indifferent man who believes in noth'
ing, not even in himself, and who ad
mits nothing to be positive except
crime and dishonor.-Marion Crawford
in "Cecilia."'
The only ghosts, I believe, who creep
into this world are dead young moth
ers, returned to see how their children
fare. There is no other inducement
great enough to bring the departed
back.-James M. Barrie in "The Little
White Bird."
Good humor is a form of tenderness.
Those who are easy to laugh are like
wise ready to be sorry* And they
have a fund of sympathy to draw on
whenever the necessity arises.--Joel
Chandler Harris in "Gabriel Tolliver."
I tell you the fascination of this pit
gambling is something no one who
hasn't experienced it can have any
conception of. I believe it is worse
than liquor, worse than morphine.
Once you get into it it grips you and
'draws you and draws you, and the
nearer you get to the end the easier it
seems to win, till all of a sudden, ah,
there's the whirlpool!-Frank Norris
in "The Pit."
Don't you go an' git sorry fer yer
self. That's one thing I can't stand
in nobody. There's always lots of oth
er folks you kin be sorry fer 'stid of
yerself. Ain't you proud you ain't got
a harelip? Why, that one thought is
enough to keep me from ever gittin'
sorry fer myself.-Alce Caldwell He
gan in "Lovey Mary."
If you can't be really happy, pretend
that you are happy, and tihe irst thing
you know it will be a reality.-Joel
Chandler Harris in "Gabriel Telrvea."
Frpm Washington comes a staer
about James Whitcomb Riley whim
may or may not be true, but whish b
worth the telling. It is to the. ereet
that Billy Ethell, a capitol atacht
has recently received a letter trem the
poet of all Hooslerdom. Ethell e3s
that he and Riley are old cheme and
that years ago they both worked to
gether for an Indiana sign palater.
"Jim has money in his pocket new,"
says Ethell. "He told me*w 'e that
some day he would be rich and that
when he came into his own he intend
ed to carry money in every pocket, just
to see how good it felt. I met him in
Indianapolis a couple of years ago and
reminded him of his prediction.
"'Well, it came true,' said Jim,
reaching for his pockets. He brought
out bills from each pocket in his over
coat and then fished down into his
coat and vest and brought out more
bills from every pocket. Then his
hands dived lnto his trousers, and he
hauled out silver and small bills from
both sides and from his pistol pockets.
Finally he went into his watch pocket
and brought out a $5 goldpiece.
"'There you are,' he said trium
phantly. 'I have got money in every
pocket.' "
Philip Verrill Mighels, whose novel,
"The Inevitable," has been attracting
attention, says that while in London
engaged upon the original 'draft of his
novel he found himself at last so haunt
ed by neglected duties that he took a
day in which to attend to many small
affairs of business. It was summer.
After a long and trying ordeal Mr.
Mighels arrived at his home late in the
afternoon weary and disgusted.
"I went to my agent's and then to
see Mrs. Blank's solicitor and then to
the offices of five different editors and
finally to see my publisher," he said.
"The agent is on the continent, the
lawyer hadn't shown up all day at his
office, two of the editors are ill, one is
on his vacation, and the remaining two
could not be found, while the publisher
has moved I don't know where. I
stopped for a minute at Goldsmith's
grave. Of all the persons I called upon
all day Goldsmith was the only one
who was in."
Authors need not be discouraged
when they compare the possible results
of their labors with those of business
men. General Lew Wallace has built a
huge modern apartilent house in In
dianapolis solely out of the proceeds of
his novel '"The Prince of India." And
it is well known that the popular suc
cess of the latter has not equaled that
of the perennial "Ben-Hur." It is quite
probable that "Ben-Hur" has supplied
the Wi. rewitba- for a number of apart

if you dumped a lot of engine sparks
on the pine roof of a dry building in
summer time four minutes were ample
time to settle the fate of the structure
in spite of all efforts to save it. There
were some incredulous smiles at this.
The attorney took out his watch and
handed it to Juryman L. S. Harlan, a
banker of Clifton Hill, Randollph coun
ty, and requested him to signal whei
four minutes had passed. The jurymnen
leaned over and looked down at the
watch; then they got tired and sett li4

minutes of his allotted time, out he
felt that it was well invested. At last
Juror Harlan announced the four mni.1
utes ha..xpired and handed the wahts
back to Mr. Nortoni. Only four min
utes, and yet to every man in the room
it had seemed, under the suppressed
tension, to have been twice as long.
The court remarked after the court remarked after the case had
been decided that it appeared fully
fifteen minutes. The wearisome sus
pense was an effective object lesson to
the jury and was a startling exposition
of what might transpire in that time.
The jury found that the defendant's
engine had ample time in four minutes
to-fire the restaurant building, and they
brought in a verdict for the plaintiff
for $14,198.28-the exact sum her proof
showed her loss to be."
The case had beep pending in the
courts ten years.-Kansas City Journal.
Tennyson and Truth.
One of the pleasaatest things that
Tennyson's niece has to say of him is
"hs: "I think no man that ever lived
eame nearer than he did to perfect
truthfulness. He was often a martyr
to his determiination never to say any
thing that was not strictly and abso
lutely true, for none could be more
sensitive than he was about paining
people, and yet he would discard all
smooth speeches that would have given
pleasure, but would not have been
quite sincere, and would just say right
out the wholesome, though sometimes
unpalatable, truth instead, feeling utter
ly miserable for days afterward, with
the fear that in this moral surgery he
had not handled the knife as gently as
he might have done. Unless by his
keeping silence the cause of truth
would have suffered, he would never
mention any matter that might injure
a single human being, and he always
put the best construction upon peo
ple's words and actiohs. * * * He was
always far more severe with himself
than with others and would bitterly
reproach himself for being brusque in
manner to untactful strangers and for
allowing fits of depression to get pos
session of him at times."
Profts of Wagner's Operas.
Accounts are published in Germany
showing the amount of the royalties
earned in 1902 by the compositions of
Richard Wagner. The most lucrative
of the operas was "Lohengrin," which
was played 997 tipnes in Germany, 420
times in France, Holland and Italy
and 318 times in England and the Unit
ed States and brought in £13,600. Next
In popularity came "Tannhauser," play
ed 208 times in Germany and 210 times
elsewhere, at a profit of £7.050. "The
Flying Dutchman" earned £2,550; "Die
Meistersinger," £3,600; "Tristan and
Isolde," £700, while "Die Walkure."
"Rheingold," "Siegfried" and "Gotter
dammerung" brought in £4,400 among
them. The total royalties of the year
were over £30,000, and this figure does
not include the Baireuth receipts.
The Old Buffer Hadn't Gone.
Canon Stratton, the vicar of St.
Paul's, Leeds, now in his eightieth
year, is a generous philanthropist, and
many stories are told in Leeds of the
manner in which the good man has
been imposed upon. One night, as he
lingered for a moment in a house where
he had been visiting a very "bad case,"
he heard the "invalid" jump vigorously
from his bed and call out:
"Has the old buffer gone? What did
he leave?"
"The old buffer hasn't gone," cried
the canon, "and he doesn't intend to
leave anything!"
Motors In the Desert.
The recent trials by the Egypti:an
government of motors for desert use
having been concluded, a greater revo
lution is said to be in store, for trial is
to be made with a new "ship of the
desert" This vehicle is to be propelled
by wind and sail, there being plenty of'
the former in the desert, which, it is
believed, can be tUrued to good account
