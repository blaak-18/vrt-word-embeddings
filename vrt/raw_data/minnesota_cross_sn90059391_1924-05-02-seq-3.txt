Sparks from the Fiery Cross
By JOHN EIGHT POINT
“The noblest motive is the public good.”—Virgil
There is no Klannishness in a dole
ful whine.
• • •
The real Klansman says little and
does much.
• • •
A Klansman should remember that
a good many people will set their
clocks according to his watch.
• * •
Hope is the Klan's halfbrother to
action, and action is the father of
happiness.
The man who makes a business of
breaking law will soon find himself
breaking law for a business.
• • •
Let your spirit do its duty,
Klansmen, yours the living creed,
Worship at the feet of beauty,
Serve your country in her need.
Let no alien power advise you,
Hold the faith your fathers knew,
Then no foe will e er surprise you,
In this battle for the true.
* • *
No man should profess the Klan
unless he is willing to do the loyal
deeds of the Klan.
• • *
One large part of the devil’s daily
business is to make right people
think Klansmen are wrong people .
• • *
An American citizen should strive
so to live that he will not want to
lick the editor for putting his name
in the paper. The Klannish life has
nothing to fear from editors who are
not bought by alien or papal money.
• • *
Klansmen never knock. They know
that men are like motors—when they
knock they lose power.
* • •
The National Hibernian advocates
“vigorous action” toward the Ku Klux
Klan. “Sooner or later there will be
an armed conflict/’ declares this
peacefully (?) inclined journal. Pas
sive resistance is not a Hibernian
trait.” Certainly not! And if any
body can raise more hell than Irish
Catholics, let him step forth and re
ceive a silver loving cup decorated
with brickbats. We believe with the
Hibernian that “action is the natural
nature of Irish Catholics” bad ac*
tion - _ ...
The doors of the Ku Klux Klan are
not very hospitable toward the man
who will not work.
* * *
Klansmen should always “say it
with smiles” — so quickly.

Catholic; the mayor of New York is

* • •
A Klansman is a man who does not
have to prove it—he lives it.
• • •
A Klansman has the courage to
stand alone —that’s why he is fit for
Klannish deeds.
• • *
Klan knighthood means Klan rev
erence for pure American woman
hood.
* * *
True Klannishness consists in the
giving of one’s whole soul in a just
and holy cause. Pure Klannishness,
according to our solemnly-worded
tenets of faith, endows one with pa
triotism and brings a great peace.
Clean patriotism bends its knee to
God and loves all men. The sauabbles
and vices of the selfish and the weak
melt away before the sunshine of its
glowing strength.
« * *
The Klan robe that is used for a
selfish purpose has no warmth in it.

Judge Tiernan resents the idea that
a Roman Catholic must not become
president of the United States. His
resentment will not affect several
million Protestant Americans- and
his judicial opinions will doubtless
carry little weight henceforth. Even
a judge may not eternally stand
against the wishes of the masses.

A booster has been defined by
somebody as “one who does all the
good he can, to all the people he can.
and trusts the rest to God.’ In con
nection with this, it is well to re
member the definition of a knocker
as a “thing that hangs outside the
door and hag no place in the house.
We owe much of the true Ameri
canism which has been and still is
the spirit of our country today to the
Puritans. They were men and wom
en of solid worth. Their achieve
ments were fundamental and lasting.
To them is due much for the further
ance of the arts of civilization and
the happiness of the race as we
know it. They were stern, prim, su
perstitious, and many other things
that our liberalists look upon with
scorn, but their principles were of a
type to demand the highest respect

There is evidence that the Catholics
threaten Coolidge and McAdoo with
defeat if these patriotic servants of
America do not disclose their atti
tude toward the Ku Klux Klan and. in
effect, bow to the Pope. This is made
clear in a long editorial in the Balti
more Catholic Review. But, in spite
of hate, the signs are that these men
will not be moved by menaces or
blame. If we may judge of their past,
we shall say that they will hew to
the lines of their individual concep
tions of duty.

Even admitting that Arthur Bris
bane usually gums the works in his
sublime editorial chaff, he occasional
ly supplies material for a text or food
for reflection. He seems a pretty sol
id American when he talks like this:
“What has the United States to do
with deciding what Germany shall
pay, how many billions France and
the others shall get? It wasn’t our
war. It isn’t our funeral or celebra

It seems to be a settled practice on
the part of Europe to beg America
to feed and clothe the European poor.
It may be that her lords and poten
tates are living off the fat of the
land, but that does not matter in the
least. The whine is insistent; “Feed
our starving ones.” Charity is all
right—it is more than all right; it is
Godlike. But begging is an evil and
breeds greater evils. Europe begs
too much and does not try sufficient
ly to serve her poor. The classes that
can help, the rich, the powerful, the
governmental leaders —fail to extend
aid It is a good deal like Jacob sit
ting in the corner while Rachael
washes to keep the family from starv
ing Some Americans are sick of the
idea of helping Europe while Europe
guzzles wine in the corner.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 26.
President Coolidge seems to have
made a hit in his New York speech
in serving notice on Europe to put

talk to Uncle Sam about a pro

wants to make sure in his own
mind that Europe is even willing

Washington.—Dispatches telling ol

llolnienkollen, and of the many Anierl

phasize the summer events of Norway

“.Nature seems to take a boisterous
part in the occasion by throwing blan
ks of foliage across fields that were
*uuw-covered only a few weeks before,
and by bursting forth with gorgeous
flowers in crunnies where icicles held
sway for the past six months,” the bul
letin continues.
“All the excitement which marks our
most generally observed holiday, at
tends the Day of St. John, on June 24.
While it hears a Christian name the
holiday and its customs go back to
pagan origin. In effect the day still
Is a festival of the sun. Green birch
trees adorn every house and children
carry evergreen branches through the
streets. The analogy to Christmas
breaks down, however, when younger
folk crowd Into boats on the fiords or
hike to the mountuin woods which, at
twilight, are flecked- with bonfires. All
night long these beacons burn, as
ghostly figures of the merrymakers
dance and sing around them.
“Yearly more visitors are strapping
on their knapsacks for walking trips
through the rugged countryside of cen
tral Norway, where every rock-hewn
road seems to lead to a fiord, and
where the native customs defy the In

Font Let Down From Ceiling.
“The visitor goes to church and the
simple service seems stereotyped
enough until a bit of statuary de
scends from the celling. The figure of
an angel, supported by a rod, holds a
bowl filled with water. The surprised
visitor realizes this theatrical appur
tenance is a baptismal font.
"The simplicity and innocence of the
country folk In the remote and Isolated
sections is betokened by their promis
cuous bathing. And hy ‘bathing’ is
meant just that; not the diversion of
water splashing and sand sunning, but
getting oneself clean. A log hut Is
the village hath house. A furnace of
stones is heated and water poured over
the red-hot surface.
“Into this steam steps a family —men,
women, children, visiting relatives and
neighbors. The bathers switch each
other with birch twigs to induce more
perspiration and gleefully throw buck
ets of cold water over each other when
the heat becomes too Intense. All of
this Is nothing of an orgy—but as pro

There fishing takes the place of farm

rambling main street. The villager
rows to church, and rows to the store,
and rows to pay his evening calls.
“Grazing herds of goats is the prin
cipal land industry of Norway’s hilly
north country and these flocks give rise
to the picturesque goat-girl. The moun

from the villages and each spring sees
the young farm women driving their
herds up the mountain paths to some
lofty but sheltered valley among the

Carpenter’s Current Comments
FOREIGNERS THE CHIEF
BOOTLEGGERS
A federal grand jury, in its report
to the court, pointed out that an
overwhelming majority df bootleg
gers of foreign birth had made no
application for naturalization or had
obtained only their first papers. The
same jury recommended denial of cit
izenship and urged deportation of all
such unnaturalized foreigners. We
are in hearty accord with the jury’s
recommendation. These foreigners
must understand that the eighteenth
amendment is more than “a scrap of
pa|>er.’’ But the foreigners are not
the only offenders! Something ought
to be said and done about those
Americans who know what the law
is and yet who violate, and incite vio
lations of it. “Deport all foreign
boot leggers; put all American boot
leggers behind thebars” would be n
reasonable and righteous slogan for
this day.
THE BIBLE IN IOWA
PUBLIC SCHOOLS
The action of the lowa senate in
refusing tohave the daily reading of
the Bible in our public schools will
not pass unchallenged. Thoughtful
and able men and women have seen
the fallacy of the action and are tak
ing up the question. Enemies of the
highest and best things in a child’s
life are not much longer to have mat
ters their own way in the public
schools. It is now self-evident that
the state must be friendly to moral
teaching in the school, and that mor
ality and spirituality must become
a definite part of the pupil’s training.
The hour is coming when the voters
of this state are not going to have
the morals of their children throttled
by a few cold-blooded secularists and
sensualists who see nothing in life
but money and the unregulated in
dulgence of bodily passions. That
kind of thing must either end or the
nation will fall! The Bible should
and is going to have a definite place
in the public schools!
PREACHERS AND
POLITICS
“Preachers should stay out of poli
tics!” How often has this been
heard! J. H. Garrison, veteran edi
tor. has this fine word to say on the
subject:
“Even ministers of the gospel
used to spend far more time talk-
ing about ‘going to heaven when
we die’ than they did in urging
* their members to carry their re
ligion into business, into politics
and into all the relationships of
life, until God’s will shall be
done here on earth as it is done
in heaven. And even yet there
are many in the pews who think
the preacher should ‘let politics
alone’, meaning thereby that he
should not denounce corruption
in public, high or low, and point
out the responsibility of the peo
ple in such matters. The results
of this ‘let alone policy’ are seen
now in the revelations at our na
tional capital.”

it was necessary to conduct it out

mer, of Oklahoma, to an audience of
1,000 people. In his address Judge
Plummer declared that the purpose
of the Klan is being deliberately mis
represented by interests opposed to
it, and he compared the hostility to
the organization to the fights made
against the Masonic and other secret
orders in past years.

Musical Missionaries
(From Minneapolis Journal)
The Minnesota of Gopher Prairie
and the boosting Babbitt is just now
sending through the country two or
ganizations that furnish an extraor
dinary demonstration of what life
really means in an agricultural state
of the middle west. One of them, the
Minneapolis Symphony orchestra, is
a cosmopolitan product of the ideal
ism of city business men; the other,
the St. Olaf Lutheran choir, belongs
to the small town and the farm.
Making a half circuit of the coun
try, the orchestra carries the works
of Beethoven and Brahms, of Tschai
kowskv and Ernest Scheling—the best
that the world has done both in this
generation and in the entire century
and a half of modern music. Wher
ever it plays, whether in New York,
surfeited with its own music, or in
the small town which hails one or
chestral concert in a year as a great
civic event, it carries the message
that in Minnesota there are men and
women who care enough for so ap
parently unprofitable a thing as or
chestral music to spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars in order that
their community may have the very
best of it.
The message of the St. Olaf choir
is even more significant. From the
Gopher prairies of Minnesota some
seventy boys and girls, most of them
musically untaught and with no more
than ordinary vocal ability, have been
brought together under the leader
ship of a man of real genius and
molded into one of the two or three
outstanding mixed choirs of the
United States. This chorus does not
merely represent Minnesota; it actu
ally is Minnesota. It embodies all
the potentialities for altruistic cre
ation which lie close beneath the sur
face; it proves that the farms, right
ly cultivated, can raise music as well
as cows and wheat.
Minnesota has been widely adver
tised for the wealth of its mines, the
fertility of its lands and the natural
beauty of its scenery. The Minneap
olis Symphony orchestra and the St.
Olaf choir are advertising the men
and women of Minnesota; not simply
a few of them, who, through con
spicuous talents, have won success and
fame, but the rank and file who, as
guarantors or ticket purchasers, sup-
Eort the orchestra, and who, as the
oys and girls of St. Olaf College,
make up the choir. And though such
advertising may not bring returns in
dollars and cents, it has a profound
meaning of which every citizen of
the state may well be proud.
