UTsm or rs anmotrsisa the one
Idea In this canvass. Lacoct heads
an effort of patriotie Americans to
bury beyond redemption every sem
blance of a divided country. The
Repubiloan partyIs loncapable of the
task of unilation, for they demand
an "Inward repentance," watch no
man or set of men every yleldea
except with dishonor.
Then what I this "inward repent
ane ?" If srried to ts logical on

be tame to the loquisition that would b
seereb mea's souls for their Inmost we
thoughts. The New York World e Es

' When the subject of moving the he
0 capital to Baton Rouge was first
stgtated, Mr. Hagan was appointed th
chairman of a committee to visit the is
ruins and make an estimate of what
would be the probable cost of the t
necessary repairs.
g Senator Hagan and his Xommittee G
mailde a careful examination of the do
premises; found that the walls were
burnt out and oracked In many pla

SMand the building in such a state of
decay that to put It In thorough or
der would coat about $180,000.

in heard, unofficially, that I had been
ot chosen to fill it. As the services re
he quired, Itf faithfully performed, are
f- honestly worth every cent, of the

would be conasidered a political one, bi
t or be sought for by hungry polittl* e
lee clans; in this I was mistaken, to a im
id- certain extent, namely, that while k
g.reat politleians, a a rtlle, have an es
eye to soft places with fat salaries M
h only, the "omall fry" are content to re
LE bethe "snappers tip of unconsidered Ir
