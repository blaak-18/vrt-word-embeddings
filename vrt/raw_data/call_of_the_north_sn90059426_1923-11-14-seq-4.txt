MENACE OF MODERN IMMIGRATE
By Dr. H. W. Evans, Imperial Wizard
An Address Delivered October 24th onJClan Day at Texas
State Fair, Dallas.
They are a people "apart from all
other peoples. They always will be.
On the one side are their religious
ceremonies, their social customs, their
aversiop to the Gentile—all is inflex
ible as fate; on the other, a racial and
religious antipathy, unrelenting and
unabating since the cross of Calvary.
This should not be; it is.
Would you have your daughter
marry a Jew? We were willing, that
could not solve the'problem of assimi
lation, because the Jew would stand
out against it. A merging through
intermarriage can never be brought
about. Were the melting pot to burn
hundreds and hundreds of years, Jew
and Gentile would each emerge as he
is today, only the Gentile would have
been affected by many other elements
and the Jew would not.
As a race the Jewish are law abid
ing. They are of physically whole
some stock, for the most part untaint
ed by immoralities among themselves.
They are mentally alert. They are a
family people, reverently and eugen
icly responsive to God’s laws in the
home. But their homes are not Amer
ican but Jewish homes, into which we
cannot go and from which they will
never emerge for a real intermingling
with America.
Not only because of the forbidden
intermarriage, but also in anational
sense, is the Jew unmergeable. By
every patriotic test, he is alien and
unassimilable. Not in a thousand
years of continuous residence would
he form basic attachments comparable
to those the older type of immigrant
would form within a year. The evil
influence of persecution is upon him.
It is as though he was here today and
might be forced to flee tomorrow. He
does not tie himself to the land. Jew
owning farmers are almost negligible;
and it is largely only the Hebrew
bankers and long established mer
chants that have their own homes..
Rarely do you find him engaged even
in the binding ties of constructive la
bor. Although charitable with each
other, as a class the Jews are mercen
ary minded—money mad. To get, “to
have and to hold,” is their material
istic motto, and always—always—do
you find them seeking some tangible,
quickly convertible, easily movable,
kind of wealth which is in no vital
way related to and dependent upon
SQcial and national values.
I must speak now of a third ele
ment among our people whose assim
ilation is impossible without the grav
est danger to our institutions.
No nation can long endure that per
mits a higher temporal allegiance
than to its own government. Through
out all .history, medieval and modern,
every church encroachment upon
school and state, every attempt at
temporal power by a religious organ
ization, has been attended by sinister
results both to church and state. A
divided allegiance is the deadliest,
most menacing, of national dangers.
The hierarchies of Roman and
Greek Catholicism violate that prin
ciple. They demand, and increasingly
seek to exercise, dominion outside the
spiritual. To them the presidency at
Washington is subordinate to the
priesthood in Rome. The parochial
school alone is sufficient proof of a
divided allegiance, a separatist in
stinct. They demand that our future
citizens be trained, not in public
schools, but under the control and ih
fluence of a priesthood that teaches
supreme loyalty to a religious oli
garchy that is not even of American
domicile.
I make no attempt to show cause
and effect in this connection—you
may make your own deductions—but
do you realize, my friends, that the
illiteracy of Europe is practically con
fined to Catholic countries?
In Italy, 37 per cent of the popula
tion over ten years of age are without
education, and 38.7 per cent of all
marriages are by illiterates. Spain
has 58.7 per cent of illiterates; Portu
gal, 68.9 per cent.
Consider the Greek Catholic coun
tries and the comparison with our
own standards is ever more alarm
ing. Greek illiteracy is 57.2 per cent;
that of Serbia, 78.9; while in Bulgaria
and Roqmania more than 60 in every
hundred are illiterate. It is unfair to
suggest that Catholicism, if not ac
tually desiring that condition, thrives
upon ignorance?
Since 1900, millions of Catholics
from such sources have pouTed into
America. They are coming now, un

der the quota law, in predominating
numbers.
In the face of all these tragic facts,
what are we to do about this para
mountly impobrtant problem for the
composition of our people ? What have
we done about it?
First, as I have shown, there was
unrestricted immigration.
Then came a slight sign of regula
tion, manifested in control by the
several states. That was during the
first three-fourths of the last century.
The National Government did nothing
until 1882, when a law was passed
providing for the exclusion of con
victs (exxcept for political offenses),
lunatics, idiots, and persons likely to
become a public charge, to which
classes were later added anarchists,
polygamists, prostitutes, and persons
suffering from loathsome or danger
ous contagious diseases. The importa
tion of contract labor was afterward
prohibited. None of these laws, nor
their administration, -was more than
partially successful.
Exclusion of Chinese laborers by
treaty and legislation came in 1882.
In 1907, a similar attitude was taken
with respect to Japanese laborers.
Following that the literacy test was
made a part of our immigration policy
by the Congressional act of 1917.
Now we are operating under the
“quota” law enacted in 1921. That
statute fixes the influx as it existed in
1910 as a basis and permits the an
nual admission from each nation of
three per cent of the number it then
had in the United States. The quota,
however, dQes not apply to any of the
countries of the New World. Mexico
and Canada, for example, are not af
fected. Oriental immigration being
regulated by treaty and special legis
lation is also outside the quotha.
Both the educational and quota taws
have mitigated the evils of immigra
tion, but without resulting in any very
fundamental improvement. The flood
of ignorance has been lessened, and
likewise the appalling proportions of
foreigners that were coming. How
ever, it must be apparent to any
thoughtful, patriotic American, that
the mere fact of our having had, say
a million undesirable, unassimilating
aliens here in 1910 from a certain
country is not a valid reason for now
permitting 3,000 more of them en en
ter our gates eath year.
This quota idea relates entirely to
quantity, while quality should deter
mine the whole matter. Restriction,
unless it is absolute, cannot reach and
remedy the evil. Selection is the
principle that should prevail, with po
tential American quality the great
objective.
The last year, ending June thirtieth,
we admitted 522,919, most of them un
der the quota law. Statistics are not
yet available by which to determine
the actual or potential net worth to
America f these half minnion future
citizens. From a careful study of
their sources, however, I am con
vinced that more than three-fourths
of them, by reason, not of national
but of basic racial and religious char
acteristics, afe completely beyond as
similation.
Nearly two per cent of last year’s
importations were colored races;
about five per cent were of the Bal
kan types; from ten to fifteen per
cent were Jewish; and more than six
ty per cent were of undoubted papist
allegiance.
But aside from its false basis, quite
apart from its unsatisfactory results,
the quota law brings unnecessary and
inhuman hardships upon the poor im
migrant who must comply with its re
quirements. I have no words that are
adequate to pass, on to you the dis
tressing picture of Ellis Island con
ditions as they have come to me. The
voyage of Columbus in quest of his
divine discovery was hardly more pre
carious and speculative than is now
the immigrant journey to America.
To illustrate, on the night of Aug
ust 31st four steamships were racing
into New York harbor. They carried
immigrants to the number of 1,896.
In order to get this human steerage
accepted, it was necessary to time
their arrival almost to a split second.
At exactly midnight, plus the small
est fraction of a minute, it wquld be
September Ist. Those reaching Ellis
Island after midnight would be cer
tain of acceptance in the September
quota. A delay of one hour, possibly
even a minute, might be fatal to their

chances in the mad rush for admis
sion, but these ships were slightly too
anxious. They came to quarantine a
minute or two before midnight. It
was still August and not September.
The authorities so ruled and turned
them back, because the August quotas
were exhausted. For those two thou
sand immigrants, undoubtedly poor
perhaps with almost their last dollar
at stake, here was personal tragedy
to make the heart tick.
Keeping in mind that each coun
try’s quota is apportioned monthly,
does not this single incident tell the
whole story of how the system works
from the poor immigrant’s point of
view?
Does it not suggest also the inevit
able results to and for America? It
is conceivable that many intelligent
men and women will face the risks of
such a system? Can we expect any
human importations better than the
worst under these conditions?
And in this connection do you not
at once come to the conclusion that
there is something radically wrong,
and cruelly inhuman, about the opera
tion of the quota law? Surely you
will perceive, as all thinking Ameri
cans must, that the machinery for the
administration of our immigration
statute should be set up at the begin
ning, and not at the end, of the journ
ey to America. All decisions concern
ing admissability, all tests of fitness,
should be made there and not here.
That simple change could not greatly
affect our interests, while for the poor
immigrant it would mean all the dif
ference between positive assurance
and the most tragic uncertainly.
What Congress Should Do
Concerning Immigration
My friends, I have hardly scratch
ed the surface of this all-important
subject of our immigration problem.
I believe, however, there has been,
enough of the depressing picture to
convince you, as I stand convinced, of
the terrible peril that lies in our
present course.
No point I have made can or will be
disputed, because the proof is imme
diate and overwhelming. The com
pletely changed character of our im
migration, from the best to the worst
Europe has to offer —who now would
or could contend against that tragic
truth? The present and recent flood
of inferior foreigners has vastly in
creased our illiteracy, vitally lowered
the health level and visibly menaced
America .by inheritable mental and
moral deficiencies. Where among true
Americans is the voice that would
dare either to contradict or defend
these evil conditions. Out of all pro
portion to its members, the immigrant
stream is moving cityward to make
modern Sodoms and Gomorrahs in a
land that for generations knew com
paratively little of such body-and
soul-destroying social infections. No
longer can it be said that those who
come are nationally our sisters and
brothers, seeking with us, and in our
spirt, the establishment of homes and
institutions that will safeguard and
sanctify the Republic. They are not
our kindred in ideals and traditions,
nor do they, or can they, comprehend
our kind of patriotism, without which
no nation will attain its highest mis
sion of an ever advancing human wel
fare.
This problem of our immigration
has become jo acutely critical, so
menacing to America in its every as
pect and influence, as to demand in
stant and heroic attention by those in
authority. I speak only as one Amer
ican, but in that capacity it humbly
seems to rile that the Congress should,
at the earliest possible moment, en>-
p *. two emergency measures.
First, stop all immigration with ex
ceptions applying only to separated
f°milies.
Second, while the gates are closed,
institute a thorough governmental in
vestigation into every phase of alien
ism, to the end that there may be ex
ect and scientific information upon
which to base a permanent immigra
tion policy. Such an official inquiry
should include—
(a) The causes and all the results
of the foreign influx, past and present
—nationally, politically, socially, eu
genicly and with respect to education,
health and morals;
(b) A survey of all our needs for
more people, with particular reference
to geographical distribution and the
requirements for production and crea
tive labor; and
(c) A study of the kinds of people
whose presence here would best meet
these agricultural and industrial
needs, always keeping in mind the all
important American matter of their
ultimate assimilation into oar civic
and social structure.
Such a comprehensive, impartial of
ficial investigation of the whole epoch
al problem seems absolutely essential
to its just solution. The Congress
cannot act to provide a remedy with
out being in possession of each and
every vital fact. Moreover, all our
people must be fully informed, be
cause in the final analysis it is public
opinion that counts for weal or woe
under our Republican form of govern
ment.
(To ko coatbnod ant woak)
THE 6RMD ARMY
OF THE RUPUBUD
We have in America organizations
which are composed entirely of one
sect, or of one color, or at one race.
The Knights of Columbus is com*
posed entirely of Roman Catholics.
The Association for Advancement of
Colored People ia oompoaed entirely
of Negroes, The Bnai Brith is om
poaed entirely of Jews. Whenever
these organizations, either in con
vention assembled o? through their
individual spokesmen attack the
Knights of the Kp Klux Klan, the
animosity hehind such attacks is
readily discernible and well defined.
These organizations, because of
their aggressiveness along religious
and racial lines, are primarily re
sponsible for the white native-born,
Gentile, Protestant Americans, or
ganizing to offset the encroachments
and clannishness of the groups
named. If the Roman Catholics, the
Negroes, and the Jews, would cease
supporting secret organizations with
in their own ranks that admit to
membership only members of their
respective sect or race, the Ku Klux
Klan, in claiming the right to exist
and function as a white, Protestant,
Gentile organization, would immedi
ately be shorn of its present most in
vulnerable argument. But as long as
Roman Catholics, or Negroes, or
Jews, insist in organizing along re
ligious and racial lines, they are ab
solutely without the bounds of rea
son in demanding that others who are
not Roman Catholics, or Negroes, or
Jews, shall not follow the example
that they have set.
It is a fact that groups organized
along religious or racial lines are
bound i;o - become clannish and over
zealous in propagating their own in
terests over the rights of others.
This is one charge that the Klan’s
enemies love to dwell on. But re
member, please, that the Roman
Catholics, the Negroes, and the Jews,
have been at it a long time. White,
native-born, Gentile, Protestant
American 9, unorganized, have suf
fered a long time because of the
clannishness, aggressiveness, and
bulldozing of these organized racial
and religious groups. The Klan, a
late comer, was literally forced into
existence. The charge that the Klan
is un-American due to the fact that
it excludes men because of their race
or religion would hold water possibly,
if the Klan were setting the example.
But in this matter the Klan is entire
ly on the defensive.
Now, further, there are numerous
other organizations in America which
do not base membership therein along
racial or religious lines. We speak
of Masonry, Pythianism, Oddfellow
ship, Elkdom, the American Legion,
the Grand Army of the Republic, and
numerous others. With hut few ex
ceptions, if any, all Roman Catholics,
Negroes, Jews, Protestants, and
others are eligible to membership. It
is a fact that none of these as an
organization have condemned the Ku
Klux Klan. The fact that Klansmen
are in great numbers also members
of these organizations forestalls any
possibility of any of these organiza
tions, in their entirety or as a unit,
condemning the Ku Klux Klan.
When the Shriners met in Washing
ton they constituted in part a mighty
gathering of Klansmen. When the
Dokies met in Portland, entire dele
gations were also Klansmen. When
the Elks met in Atlanta the Imperial
Palace of the Klan was besieged by
Elks who were also Klansmen. En
tire posts of the American Legion are
composed of Klansmen. Pythianism
and Oddfellowship are literally honey
combed with Klansmen. Over one
half million Masons today are also
Klansmen. But when a Mason, or
an Elk, or an Pythian, here and there,
in seeking newspaper notoriety, pub
licly condemns the Klan, a notion
•goes through some people’s heads
that they speak for' their entire or
ganization. They forget that when
one Mason, or one Legionaire, or
one Elk, rears up on his hind legs
to slam the Klan, that there are
brothers in the ranks by the tens of
thousands who emphatically differ
with their alleged spokesmen.
This naturally applies also to the
G. A. R. When the G. A. R. held its
national contention in Milwaukee last
month, two gentlemen, namely, James
W. Willett and James Tanner,
thought it their sacred duty to slam
the Klan. Brother Tanner termed
the Ku Klux Klfcn “the spawn of
hell.” True in a sense. Romanism
is responsible for the Klan’s exist
ence. But while these two aged vet
erans were using their G. A. R. mem
bership as a vehicle to vent their
hatred on an organization which they
in turn claim is based on hatred,
many of their brother delegates were
wishing the Klan God-speed! Ac
cording to reports from Milwaukee
Klansmen who served on the various
committees, and many who opened
their homes to give these splendid
old men shelter, a large proportion
of the delegates were either Klans
men, or thoroughly in sympathy with
the Klan! To the Grand Army of
the Republic, in spite of its Willetts
and Tanners, we salute!—The Bad
ger American.

PROTESTANT PASTOR QUITS CHURCH FOR
RUN WHEN COMMUNITY ASKS DECISION
Assumption, HI. —Making the most
serious charges probably ever flung
at a community, Rev. E, Frank Patton
has resigned the pastorate of the
First Christian Church hera. In a
latter addressed to the Official Board
and tp members of the congregation
Rev. Patton said:
“Living in an age when I do not
feel obliged to submit to the intended
humalkting taunts flung at myself
and family by those who have spent
almost a lifetime making life miser
able for all my predecessors;
“Facing daily the fact that my
membership in the ranks of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is the
chief cause for most of the antagon
ism displayed by the members of the
Official Board—who, for commercial
and social reasons hobnob with the lo
cal representative of Rome’s political
machine, and sell their manhood and
womanhood for a mess of Romish
pottage;
“Realizing that for years the
loaders of the Official Board have
maintained a ‘Jack’ Walton attitude
toward all ministers whom they could
not browbeat;
“Having reasons for believing the
Official Board knows much concerning
the bootlegging, gambling and gen
eral moral, social and spiritual filth
existing in Assumption—and that
they will lift neither hand nor voice
against these evils, but fight the pas
tor who even hints at a cleanup;
“Having been, told by the chairman
of the Official Board (and the same
was sanctioned by another elder
present), ‘You can’t go into the pul
pit and preach Ku Kluxism and
Americanism and be a Christian and
a minister of the Gospel. No Chris
tian church will stand fpr it—at least
WE won’t. When Ku Kluxism is
dead and in torment, Jesus and the
Christian church will still be here’;
“Looking upon these officials as the
very tail-enders of manhood and
Americanism; deeming them un
worthy the services of one consecrat
ed for life to CHRIST and AMERI
CANISM, I hereby tender my resigna
tion as the pastor of this congrega
tion; and may God pity my success
or;”
Details of Fight
The foregoing resignation speaks
for itself. It tells simply the story of
one more who is willing to pay the
price, whatever that might be, that
the principles of Americanism might
be kept impressed on the minds of
those most in need of indoctrination.
After a two-year pastorate with
this people, this man lived to learn
that not all who call themselves Pro
testant—though born under the Stars
and Stripes—are Americans at heart.
He lives to learn that the members of
his Official Board (all but one or two
are members of the Masonic fratern
ity) care more for the fcood opinion of
the local Catholic priest than for the
welfare of their own congregation or
pastor; and this condition has existed
for 25 years, at least. He lived long
enough with this people to learn how
obedient Protestant (so-called) busi
ness men, for business reasons, are
to the commands and demands of
Rome’s local representatives.
Things moved along swimmingly
with this reverend gentleman until it
leaked out that he was in sympathy
with the Ku Klux Klan movement;
then the clouds began to gather.
Shortly after this suspicion was whis
pered about, a group of robed Klans
men visited him during a Sunday
evening service showed up more
threatening. About the middle of
summer, the local Klan which this
minister organized, invited the folks
far and near to spend an evening with
them and learn some vital facts about
this wonderful organization. They
came by the hundreds and thousands
—and the speaker of the evening was
Rev. Patton. Theta it was the storm
broke; and the members of his Offi
cial Board, Protestant though they
professed to be, began a system of
heckling and undermining—and work
ed diligently under the covered-up
direction and influence of the local
priest and leaders of the local K. of
C.’s. This they deny, but the course
pursued is proof against them.
By the use of abuse, lying and all
the slimy filthiness of snakes, the
leaders of the Official Board strove to
rid themselves of him who had man
hood enough to espouse the cause of
Christ and Americanism. A few of
the board had courage enough to open
ly criticise, the pastor’s relations with
the Klan, but others advised against
this—for business reasons. TEen
they determined on the course of mak
ing life so unbearable for the pastor
as to force him to quit the field be
fore his family or himself could have
any peace of mind.
The Catholic leaders in this com
munity have led aronnd by the nose
with a financial, political or matri
monial hook the leaders in the local
Christian church, and now have them
at a point where they rest in the
fond, but false belief that, with the
departure of Rev. Patton from his
pastorate will come also an end to the
local Klan. Such shall never be the
case, because the local Klan is far
enough advanced numerically to with
stand any and all attacks of the
enemy. Rev. Patton will remain in
Assumption, and will continue hia
work as a member of the Illinois
Speakers’ Bureau of the Ku Klux
Klan.
As sfton aa he gflts in touph with a
qfttagregatipn with enough backbone
to stand hack of a pastor with back
hone, he may change his plana with
reference to his place of residence;
but for the present will remain on this
field.
So it is that Rome, working with
poor, misguided Protestant tools, have
started oat to get the goat of another
loyal soldier of the cause; but they
have reckoned without a host. The
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan take
care of their own, and this case will
be no exception to the rule. This
minister of the cross may suffer in
conveniences for a while, but out of
his struggles and inconveniences will
rise up thousands to take their places
in the ranks of the fastest growing
fraternal-patriotic order in the world
—the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Well might we pray for more men
of the mental, moral and .spiritual
caliber of this our co-worker—E. F.
Patton, of Rome and white-mule-rid
den Assumption; one of the towna in
the fair state of Illinois as yet under
the domination of Rome, Rum and
Rottenness; with Protestant (so-call
ed) to put over the dirty work of the
bootleggers, Romaniss and Jews.
Because this trinity fears the con
sequences resulting from the local
Klan co-operating with the officers of
the law; because they look upon it as
a menace to the rottenness they have
been putting over, they would remove
its leader in the hope of ultimately
dissolving the local organization.
Verily, they labor in vain; the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan ferge ahead.
As Klansmen we must rally to the
support of these clergymen who have
made, and are willing to continue to
make, sacrifice for the advancement
of the cause. Wild animals desert
their wounded and fallen, but Klans
men must stand by those who have
suffered wounds because they were
standing for us.

Let the chimes of their bells rir.g from

Make your promise of Heaven secure

And gather the millions of wander

Your creeds and your faith defend as

But still let our Little Red School

Stand back from its portals, dare not

Free schools are America’s glory and

Which no vandal hand shall destroy

To save them from danger, if threat

And the School shall remain the pride

Our anchor of hope through the ages

The State is supreme and the Church

The State guards its schools, let the

Call a halt, priests and prelates, nor

The State, for the law of the land will
