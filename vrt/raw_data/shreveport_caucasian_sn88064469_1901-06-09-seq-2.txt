sizes. A door shuts these in and pro
tects them from dust. Such an ensel
takes up no more room than the ordi
nary easel. for the latter must have
space for the third leg in the rear. Pine
or whitewood can be used In its con
struction, the whole being given a coat
of black or white enamel paint when
completed. Another very attractive
finish is a coat of the dead black, lus
terless paint that can now be had. This
gives the same effect as that produced
by the black Iron furnishings that are
now so common, says The Household,
which adds the following to these use
ful hints:
A most convenient feature in the fur
nishing of a room is the window seat
that architects are building into many
of the new houses. These seats may be
put In, however, at any time and are
made very Inexpensive by using a
board about 20 or 22 inches wide and
as long as the space is available. Four
turned legs should be attached, and
these may be painted in cream color
for the reception and drawing room or
made of highly polished mahogany,
birch or oak for dining room,.-halls and
library. There is hardly a room In the
house that may not have such a seat to
advantage.
All window seats should be furnished
With a thick, tufted cushion, uphol
stered with sompe serviceable material,
and there should be plenty of big,
square cushions at the back. It wood
en sides are also added, they form a
most convenient resting place for the

A Bit of Continental Lore.
One of the best "mouse scarers" is
said to be the foliage of the walnut
tree. Where traps are useless the
above is most successful, and for those
to whom such leaves are obtainable
there need be no worry about those an
noying little animals. Even after tMe
foliage has been dried it Is still ef
fectual in driving them away. On the
continent, where country folk bury
such vegetables as turnips, carrots, eel
ery. etc., for tinter use, a layer of the
abeve keeps rats and mice away.

hetOeen this country anl the orient by
way of a new Pacific coa t port. St.
Louis people of course are heartily
hopeful that the hid will Ile suctessful.
Apart front the trade of the nortlern
anlt eastern states the trallic between
the Mississippi tall(y region and the
orient has grown to lie sonuthing enor
mous, and the new line would have the
first call upon this as well upon the
trade of the southwest; hence the de
sire of the inhabitants of the Mound
City to see the new system in opera
tion.
The Pacific coast port chosen by the
syndicate is Manzanillo. in Mexico,
about 75 miles due west from Collima,
the western terminus of the Mexican
Central. Manzanillo has a splendid
harbor, landlocked and well adapted
for the entry of the largest ocean
steamers. The government of Mexico
is hand and glove with the syndicate
and has passed a law providing for the
expenditure of $6.000,0O0 to make this
port one of the finest on the coast. The
syndicate has already contracted for
the construction of four mammoth
freight steamers, and it Is proposed to
begin in course of time a passenger
service also.
The route to Manzanillo from St.
Louis has been mapped out. From the
Mound City the Frisco line will he fol.
lowed to Sherman, Tex. A line will be
built from Sherman to Fort Worth or
an existing line leased. From Fort
Worth to Brownwood the route will
continue over the Fort Worth and Rio
Grande road. Thence a new line will
be constructed to Spofford. At the last
named place connection will be effected
with the Mexican International rail
road, crossing the Rio Grande river at
Eagle Pass. The route will continue
southwest until connection Is made
with the Mexican Central at Torreon.
then on to Collima. The final link in
the chain, from Colima to the coast, is
now being built by the Mexican Central
people, and it will be completed in a
few months.
The syndicate is undoubtedly a
strong one. It includes several St.
Louis capitalists besides Mr. Pierce
and also the Seligmans of New York.
This is a guarantee in Itself that the
promoters can "make good." It is al
together likely that the syndicate's
plans will precipitate a triangular duel
for the control of the oriental trade
with the new syndicate, James J. Hill
and the interests back of him and the
Santa Fe as principals. The men who
are it the helm of the transportation
agencies of the country are aroused to
the vast possibilities of the future in
oriental freight carrying, and it is nit
likely that any one line will win the
lion's share without a combat to the
bitter end.
BT''t the new synilicate. heedless of
siges of trouble, is going merrily along
with Its platis as though nothing could
di) nmore than mtonwtottarily impede its
suecessani b-a rt anil soul the d we! I

th1'n dt nth. W har!Itoin wasI a III svl
vauI ia frmier's son. with no opportuni
ty beyond that offered by the district
school. Little points of grainniar and
refined etiquette were trifles not at
tended to in those parts. Wharton
possessed splendid ability and was full
of fire and aimbition. 1le burned to
burst his rustic shell and see the world.
Yet he was a good son, labored faith
fully on the farm summers and went to
the country school winters, with a term
or two at the village academy. Sing
ing schools and taffy pullings were the
dissipations of the time and place.
When Wharton was 20. he asked his
father dutifully one evening for the
farm horses to put to a light wagon for
a drive to a singing school a few miles
away. His request was gruffly refused.
Wharton said never a word, but the
next day be turned his back on his
home and never returued. He wander
ed to the west, earning his fIving as he.
went and as he could. He was one of
the very first to go over Chilcoot pass.
With his blanket and miner's pack
upon his back,, his staff in his hand, he
marched over the snow and Ilo and
built his little boat to shoot the Yukon
rapids when the river thawed. He had
tremendous capacity for work, and he
drained It to the last drop. There was
one strange thing. I have heard him
say that all the time he was tolling
over Chilcoot and up the Yukon and
half killing himself with pick and
crowbar daszling pictures of gold in
nuggets, in coins and in bags flled
with the yellow dust floated before his
eyes always, asleep and awake. He
could actually see the gold in shadowy
pictures before his open eyes some
times. Was it a prophecy c- a picture
reflected from the images in his own
determined mind? I don't know.
Wharton was a hard bdhded. altogether
matter of fact person, which makes the
visions all the stranger.
Hle was successful from the start.
He lamed his back permanently
through lifting a great iron bar, and he
nearly died of typhoid fever in 1898,
but he got gold by the bucketful. In
1898 the farmer's son, at the age of 28,
was worth $200.000, accumulated in
three years. In the autumn of that
year lie retur:t . to the United States
and went across the sea to London to
form a mining company amonig British
investors. Hle returned to Ai.ierica and
came back to the Klondike in February

or down the frozen Y uken between
