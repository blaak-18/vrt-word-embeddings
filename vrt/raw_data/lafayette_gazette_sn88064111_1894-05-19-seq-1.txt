A SMART CRIMINAL.
W lh' Ho Secured an _Easy Job in
the Wardon's Offioe.
The train stopped for a few moments
at a small town and a young girl got in.
She was tall, slender and pretty, a true
village lass, dressed in a neat gown,
but one which, nevertheless, -bore evi
rlence of home manufacture. The
coach was rather crowded and she
looked this way and that for a seat.
t'hen her bright glance rested upon
two men seated in the rearof the coach,
and she gave an exclamation as she
came toward them.
"Why, George Coomer," she said, as
she stopped near the younger of the
two meyt and extended her hand cor
dially.
lie was a good-looking young fellow,
dressed with great taste, and was evi
dently a. friend of nuid lang syne with
the young girl. Bly his side was seated
an older man with coarse features, a
hard expression resting upon his face.
lie wore a slouch hat. lie was power
fully built and would evidently be a
hard man to handle where physical
force was called for.
"Why, little Grace Shaw." exclaimed
the young man. But he did not rise,
nor did he extend his hand. Ile reached
-over with his left hand and turned over
:L seat.
"Won't you sit down here?" he
asked.
"With pleasure. It is so long since I
have seen you. George."
"Yes, about ten years." Then allud
ing to his companion, he said: "This
is-this is my friend, Mr. Charles
Grove."
The young woman bowed stiffly, but
she made up her mind that she would
not like the companion of her old friend.
There was something forbidding about
hini to her.
"What have you been doing. George,
since you left town?"
"Oh, a little of everything and a good
deal of nothing."
" It was unkind not to have let any
of your old friends hear from ~you all
this time."
"WeU, a man is so busy, or rather so
occupied in town with doing what little
he has to do, thet he-"
"Forgets old friends," she added, re
proachPully.
* "Well, not exactly. But tell me about
yourself."
"'Theyi is ..-nthing to telL I am

were getting on. Some of us said that
you were always so smart that you
would do very well in New York. Have

The bung man laughed.
"Ask my .friendhere," he said.

meant when he said he was going to a
big house. I am going to take himn
there. I am a United States tiSrshal

The other man gave a grunt and a
snort.
"Well, I am blowed," he said.
"What has he done?"' ahe asked, eye
ing him with terror.
"Oh, not very much: lie ib h Ieiter

as soon pick your pocket as run a faro
bank; he would just as soon enter a
front door and help hitselt as he
would to climb a. pth. lie is simply
a good alltor~und crook, and 1 am tak
ing him to jail." -
"Whew! whew!" whistled the other
man, regarding the young fellow with
amazemen t
"But don't be alarmed itn~ dear. lie
won't be ugly to'day. He knows that
I're got him and he'll keep quiet. Just
hand me that newspaper, will you?
It is as well that people should notl
know what bad company I'tst in."
"Well, I've a good notion to punch-"
began the other man.
"'How long is he sent up for?" asked
the young lady.
"Only five years. but he deserves ten,
and I wish they had given it to himn."
"Is it possible?"
"Yes in 1883 he robbed a house of
six hundred and fifty-three dollars; in
1885 he escaped from jail; in 1880 he
sandbagged a man and took his wateh!
two years after lie was running a
crooked gambling house, and now he
is sent up for forgery. Ile is capable
of all the small vices, and a good many
of the big ones."
By this time the train had arrived at
the station where the young girl was
to leave the train.
"Well good-by, George," she said, Pis
ing.
"(Good-by. Gracie."
"I'm so glad to have seen you."
"And I, also. You are becoming
such a sweet, pretty girl,"
•"You don't think so?"
"Indeed I do."
"I'm so glad that you hre done well
in the city, and I will tell all your old
friends."
"Yes, do."
"Be careful of that man with you.
Aren't you afraid of him?"
"Oh, no."
"Well, good-by."
"Good-by."
liHe extended his left hand.
"Shake!" he said.
She put her pretty' hand in his and
he gave it a pressure that made her
blush.
"Sorry I can't shake with the other
hand," he said, "but duty, you know,
duty-"
"Yes."
"Good-by."
"Good-by."
"Don't forget to tell all the folks I
am doing well."
"I won't."
"Am prosperous and all that."
"Good-by."
She was off, and now the train was
bowling on again.
The other man took a key from his
pocket and unlocked the handcuffs.
Then he fastened the end that had been
attached to him to the iron work of the
seat. .
"Now, Confidence Jim, if you meet
any more of your lady friends, just in
troduce this seat to'them."
With that the other man walked into
a smoker and lighted a cigar, but he
kept his eyes upon the man who was
fastened to the seat. But when the
warden of the jail heard of the story
he laughed. Then he gave the smooth
prisoner work in his own oflice.-De

FARMER AND PLANTiER.
RETROSPECTIVE.
Leao)kieg C lkWlard Over a. Gloom Year
with ua gestions for the Future.
The farmers of the southern country
began the past year full of hope and
energy. In looking bshek tlpon its
irloonfy e lDe, they hind it equal tO
ttohe iii its iecotrd of disaster and
blighted hpdrs.
With the hberieiice so fresi aiid
terrible in its results before them, will
they persist in planting cotton at a
price now far below the cost of pro
duction, and which will o istill lower
Ieuler tllhd ancial pressure which is
"upon the country and the evident In
crease of the western states in its pro
duction? The impoverished cotton
lands present a distressing .ppea'nee
when, within reasonable eIeii tiduI;
we ean tktiect still Ibiover prices
dtihiag the coming fall for the
staple. .Many articles have been print
ed on the necessity of every farm pro
ducing its supplies. The aereage of
cotton planted tiet hiot decrease, and
n5 the lands become worn, a greater
number of acres are planted to produce
a certain amount of cotton. The close
of each year finds the cotton planter
deeper in debt than the pretedittg otie
The cost of productiiti it iS1t bdansid
ered and the losses are laid to the over
production. When the cost of produc
tion is greater than the actual market
value the inevitable is before the pro
ducer, i. e., he will have the easistanace
of the sheriff l his doun*.y in winding
bti his business.
The following questions should pre
sent themselves to the cotton planter:
Can I lessen the cost of production to
such an extent as to admit a i'gasnh
ble profit? Is the present situation
such as that there is a chance of escape
for a cotton planter niottob heavily| itii
vodled i'ith debt, 'the last question is
hot hard to answer. "There is hope
for him who will turn from the folly of
his ways." Let him make his supplies
at home, raise thorglighbrecd cattle and
hogs; the very best always pay. If he
is not able to begin with purebred
stock, let him start with a purebred
male on his common stock. The male is
considered by the best breeders at least
one-half of the lihed. Let Willt tele:t
a breed of Cattle that there will be
sale for. But little is known at pres
ent to southern farmers of the great
profit there is in breeding Guernsey
cattle, either for sale .or for domestic
use. They are handsome and easily
milked, and are, beyold doubt, the
cows for profit and for the family.
Their flow of milk is generous tnd the
cream thick, abundant, very rich and
quick rising. They are good feeders
and not inclined to take on ~ieShi *hpile
milking, and as a niatural result will
convert all their feed into milk and
Cream. The butter is golden, and
holds its color through the entire win
ter. The bulls are gentle and hand
some; their calves are large and latdy
from birth, maturie rapidly and are fast
breeders.
The progressive farmer will improve
his stock, and breed those classes that
will be most profitable to him. lie
will plant as much grain as he can pre
pare the land to sow, and tvhet he does
this-produces his necessary supplies
Iat home and plants cotton only as a
surplus crop, he will be free from much
of the drudgery that the farmer now
has to undergo, and will once more see
pleasure in life on the farm. Heavy
grain crops mean more cattle and hogs,
and the successful handling of them
means improved land and sucCessful
farming. Heavy planting of cotton
will never enable a man to pay his
debts. It means in the end financial
ruin, a short road to poverty. Let us
then during the present year steer
clear of the error of the past, and plant
that only which we know there irprofit
in producing.-Dixie Farmer.
SENSIBLE SUGGESTIONS
To the farmer of the South Reiterated
as of Importance.
In 1883 the leading cotton factors of
St. Louis issued an address to the cot
ton growers of the south, in which
they discussed the matter in a sensible
and practical manner. We refer to
them now for the purpose of reiterat
ing them, as the subject is one of vital
importance.
"Your section," they remark, "pos
sesses the finest farming lands and the
most salubrious climate in the world,
and should be to day financially inde
pendent. Instead of having to borrow
on a crop before it is made, should
have her corn bins and larders filled
before commencing a crop.
"With all your patient toil and econ
omy, you are neither so thriving or
prosperous as you should be.
"There is a cause for these troubles,
and we offer, without presuming, the
following suggestions:
"1. The credit system, as it is now
in vogue in the south, is disastrous to
the planters and tenants, forcing them
to pay extravagant prices for supplies,
causing their crops to be forced into
market with such rapidity and in such
quantities as to break prices almost
invariably below the cost of produc
tion.
"'2. After noting for years the effect
of large crops of cotton, we find that
the overproduction of the staple is the
key-note to the sittation, and we
strongly advise all parties interested
in the prosperity of the south to dis
courage the planting of large acreage
this year, and devote their labort first
to the raising of grain, catle and hogs,
and give the balance of their time to
the cnlture of hogs.
"This policy will bring. good results
in many ways. For instance, many
small farmers-and large ones also
are so heavily in debt whentheir cot
ton is ready for sale that they are
compeled to let it go, Even though
its price is below its intrinsic
worth, while Ift they had supplies at
home, produced, and not bought on a
credit, they oduld afoird o:'hold their
cotton until they felt jsit fled In sell.

A Good Test From Which Eirery Farmei
Can Evolve a 5eriaion.
Farmers diffel ask to the tbest method
of making money by farming. One
farmer contends that he can make more
money by cultivating a large area of
land to the plow, while another class
of farmers claim that they can make
more money by etiltivat1ti' less land'"
With tiiitoilgr bialtri.i acid libekal
fertilization, which is, in effect, the in
tensive system of farming. -
When money could be made by the
cultivation of a large number of acres
of land, it was because the lartds ierd
fresh and labor more reliable than
it is now. The farmer would cut
down a lot of wood land and cul
tivate it with all his might until it
ceased to make a paying crop. He
would then turn it out .to rest, and eut
dowi iidore wood land. The farmer
then knew very well that he could not
work poor land with slave labor, even
though he had them under-good con
trol. How then is it possible now to
make money on poor land, and every.~
thing out of joint, and the products of
the farm down far below the cost of
production?

ing our mode of farming when it is so

The way is open to everyone that

Inseet Etetteies to staled Gftit.:
ihsects that attack stored grain, do
an immense amount of damage every
year. As a rule, they are already with
in the grain when it is put away in the
autumn, and during the winter they
continue their work of destruction.
In the spring the bins in Awhich the
grain has been kept during the winter,
ofter fairly swarm with pests, and
after awhile they escape to the field to
begin their work anew. In the spring
is one of the best' and important
times to destroy these insects, for
they should be killed before they
make their escape to the fields.

HERE AND THERE.
-Thle worst form of grippe is the
mortgage.
-The farmer can not run his farm
successfully without plans.
-Farming requires as much brain
work to insure success as any other
business.
-The high price of the hog product in
1193 may prove a blessipg in disguise to
the people of the south.
-No statistics swill convince the farm
er or anybody else that he is prosperous
when his income is small and hisoutgo
large.
-On many farms it would be wise to
turn one-half the land to grass and put
all the work on the other half. Land
in grass is worth as much per acre as It
could be rented for.
-The only practical way to reduce
the amount and increase the price of
thile cotton crop of the south is to more
generally adopt diversified farming.
This is a practical "double-header," "a
rule that works both ways," the
diversified products being more profita
ble than cotton, and making a smaller
amount of cotton bring more money.
-The late Hiram Smith was once
asked, in a meeting of the Wisconsin
Dairymen's association to state the
first step to be taken in starting a
dairy, and his promut answer was:
"Buy a bull." The bull is always the
most important half of the herd, and
the more inferior the cows the more
important it is that the buth should be
of super-exeellent dairy merit.
-The worm which attacks the to
mato is the same as that which later
attacks cotton.. The best preventive
for its attack upon the tomato consists
in planting corn with the tomatoes.
Plant the corn early and the first brood
of the worms will brerd upon it rather
than upon tlie toRatoes. They are
often called the bud worms. It is
doubtful whether the application of

NOVEL SINGING SCHOOL.
aere Little Bullnaches Are Tafght sb
Vocal Art.
One of the beet cage songsters that
comes to us from across the water is
Ithe little bullfinch, a small, shy bird
which inhabits the well-wooded dis
Iricts of Asia, central and southern
Europe, and parts of England. It is
found iii this country only as a cap
tive: At home the bullfinch attacks
the yofng buds of fruit-trees, aid in
curs the enmity of the gardeners all
through Europe; but the bird is such a
sweet singer and whistler that his
fault in this respect is overcome by his
excess of gddd qualities. In Germany
thousands of bullfinches are bred and
trained for the market every year, and
many are imported to this country as
cage-birds.
At liess and Fulda are several cele
brated shlging-eehools where these
singers have their voices and ears
trained almost to perfection. Germany
has supplied to the world some of the
grandest human munsicians; and she
excels as well in cultivating and train
ing the little bird-musicians sent forth
tod ll parts of the world.
The little bullfinehes are raised in
confinement, and when very young they
are divided into classes of six each.
Each class has a separate room, where
the six little birds are shut up in dark
ness, with plenty of food near them.
'his is before they have yet learned to
whistle and imitate the songs of other
birds. Suddenly the sweet notes of an
organ startle the birds, and cause them
to hop around in their dark prison. As
the music continues, their 'spirits be
come enlivened. Soon they pick up
some of the food and chirp forth a few
crude notes in imitation of the music.
Light is then gradually allowed to en
ter the room, thus increasing the hap
piness of the singers, and they break
forth into ecstatic song. The music is
continued all day, and the enthusiastic
birds try to follow and imitate it until
fairly exhausted by their efforts.
This is the preparatory school; and
after each class of six has spent som
time here, the several birds are hande
over to training-boys whose business it
is to continue their instruction. The
advanced pupils are taken into separate
rooms where organs are played from
early morning and night. The organs
used are ordinary organs that have soft,
pure, flute-like notes, with nothing
harsh or disagreeable in the sound.
Some birds are trained by means of
the flute, but in the larger establish
ments small organs are commonly
used.
Everything is done for the birds' hap
piness, and the little creatures are kept
in the best of spirits. The owner
comes around every day or trwo to ex
amine his pupils. So well does he un
derstand the natures of the little singers
that he reproves or praises the various
ones in a manner that they perfectly
understand. This training goes on for
eight or nine months, when the birds
are ready for their diplomas. If their
voices have acquired firmness, and they
do not forget or leave out passages in
their songs, they pass examination,
and are permitted to leave the singing
school. There are different grades
of . pupils in these bird seminaries,
-as in every other large school,
and, while the majority can re
member only a simple air with a short
prelude, there are some intelligent
ones that can be taught to whistle as
many as three different airs, without
spoiling or confusing them. Such
bright birds are often kept longer in
the seminary, and a postgraduate
course is given them.
In this course they are taught to
Imitate the songs of other birds, which
they do to perfection; but care is taken
to preserve their niemory of the early
education. They are also taught
amusing tricks, which increase their
value as performers. The birds from
these German seminaries are distrib
uted all over the country, and are sold
for good prices. Sometimes on first
being taken from their seminary
home the bullfinch becomes gloomy
and quiet, and refuses to sing. This is
an important period in hislife, and the
new owner should at, first occasionally
play the air that the bird has been ac
customed to hear on the organ. This
will cheer the captive's drooping cour
age, and start it into song once more.
'hese bullfinches begin their train
ing about four days after they are out
of the shell, and are not dismissed un
til nearly a year's instruction has per
fected their voices. Like the parrot,
they are very attentive, and they will
learn some of the harsh notes of their
parents if allowed to remain with them
many days. They never pipe until
they can feed themselves, and then
they are given correct piping to
imitate. A high, pure, manly whistle
will be responded to by them in a full,
round, flute-like tone. Bullfinches
brought up carelessly soon acquire bad
habits in their singing, but those sent
from the German singing schools very
rarely offend in this way. They carry
their diplomas with them, and they do
credit to their instructors. - George
Ethelbert WValsh, in St. Nicholas.
The Name of 'arner.
Not every Turner owes his name to
a lathe-working a.sncestor, for, as Mr.
Davies wrote in his. account of the
York press, "'te elabotaie initial and
capital letters :'add fbreatod marginal
borders were inveted' and drawn by
the turnours and flourishers," and it is
highly pubable tiast" thjoi made their
impress on the- nomenclature of pos
terity. Mr. Lower says that "those.
who dislike the plebeian tournure of
Turiner have coitrived t6 turn it into
Turnoure," on the plea that they came
from some Tour Noir in Normandy.
He states that-Turner- is one of the
most common of surnames, and in
clines to agree with Mr. Ferguson that
the popularity of tourneys or tournsa
ments had much to do with it..--Notes
