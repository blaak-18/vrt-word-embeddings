Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
rTRS ?" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of VIx
soAR BITTRas in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Ionic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WALK
ER'S VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient. Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious. Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

prcvalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi.
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo

Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remnarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs. is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Da. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR
BITT'sS, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored riscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy lifa
tions of the digestive organs.
" Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids witlh

take hold ofa system thus fore-armed.

Sore Eves, etc. In these, as in all other
constittutional Diseases, WALSa's VIN
RoAR I BITTRIS have shown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable cases.
For Inflammatory and Chromife
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and lnternmittent Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneysanl Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
lMechanical Diseases.-Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Goldlheaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub
ject to paralysis of the Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of WALur's

las, Itch, Scurfs, D1)iscolorations of the,
Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skin of
wIhatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed mad re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelminities will free the
svstem from worms like these Bititers.
'or FenmaleComnplaints, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood. orthe turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvemeent is soon-p,rtepaible.
Clarise the Titiattd !Blood
whenever you tiud its impnrities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleaunse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul;: your feelings will tell
you whoe. Keepo the blood pure, and the
health of the system will f,)llow.
