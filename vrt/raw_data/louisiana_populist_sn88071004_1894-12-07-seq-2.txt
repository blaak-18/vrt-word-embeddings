The Bulletin and Mr. ibbiatner.
arongressan itoaner is dissat
isfion, wthe course of the Bullexused
tin and, assuming the position of
public censor, attacks us savagely
for pubfor mlishing a statement that
the commission of fraud in the
last election in Louisiana was
without the slightest excuse. The
common excuse offered for frauds
iI State elections has been that
they wer ile cessary to save the
State from Africaniation. Pre
cause we stated that no such ex
cse coubly he offered in the last
election, Mr. not tner quibbingly
argues that if it had been a State
election, we would have exthed
fraud.
ur record ained opposf tarition on,
this subject are too definite andrule
clear for mispresetation. Wee sup
hapose consistently opposed and de- c
nounced fraud of all sorts State a
whiand National, and bywe shall adhere
Bu that principle morethane future, to
matter whom iDemt in displeases.na, if
weMr. Bostner quirepead to ignore, endorserly
silly and puewe charge that thelec
socBulletin is a Populiod stpanding, we
frlythat we are an office-seeker. Pre
uttermbly phe wishes it understoodhe
ampnd that he has ten forced to ruay
anr Congresate, United States Sena- blldoig
or, etc. Having alraye voted I
orathe Demorati ticket, State and
epNational, having supportle thea
ctrdinal doctrine of tarit reform,
whand equal right for all, we up
posed we were entitled to be call
to the Iemocratic faith and be- 1
lieve it to ie the sheett anchor of F
our people. a ;i,
As to the existence of frauds in ii
the last election, they hi:ve been' i
charged all over the State. In v
fact they are inseparalle from any ii
election in whicn the ma:sses of the
negroes participate, and therefore, ai
we have always advocrated white
primaries.
The radicals claimed that the (I
negroes voluntarily and cheerfully 1
voted for them. We all knew that e
was because thev were fooled into a
it. The l)emocrats, having res- r
cued the negroes from Radical de- 1
lusion, claimed t:hat they had
earned the right to vote or count t
the negro as they pleased, and for 1
fiftee n years the employers of no- I
groes in ()uachita parish have a
dracee. The managerrs claim this I
as a right and there is no use tde- t
vning it. In other parishes, the <
counting policy has been followed l
and it has always been the same as e
it wa4in 1s44 when 'Mr. Boatner's t
friends contested the right of Ten- I
sIs. parish to represent several
thousand fictitious votes, whicht
resulted in a split anti a race be- I
tween King and Boatner in which I
the latter was counted out. Does
he pretend that things have chang
ed
We haye often heard theset
frauds defended but never heard t
them denied. The entire press of i
thc State last spring, led by the
Timies-Democrat and States, de- f
clared that elections in this State I
have been disgraceful farces.
Let Mr. Boatner choose his po- t
sition. Whether he denies or de- I
fends this system of fraud, he will I
find himself arrayed against the
universal sentiment and sense of
the press and people of this State. t
It is this dishonesty in elections I
which is the poison in our political i
system. It is a disease which
must be cured or Louisiana is done i
for. We believe that this issue is
above all parties and above all
personal ambitions and in the next t
campaign all good citizens will I
join hands to forever banish fraud
from Louisiana. (
As to the Ruston convention, we t
have heretofore given good reasons
for not supporting its equivocal s
platform and nominee. t
TO OUR READERS. t
t
With this issue of the POPULIST C
we end our career in journalism. g
And in doing so we feel that it is v
but right that we extend our grate- a
ful thanks to the many who have
stood by us in the great fight for j,
liberty. When we launched forth 4
into the journalistic field we were,
of course, hanuicapped by inexpe- f
rience in that great field of labor
which moulds the public sentiment I
and shapes the destinies of men
and nations. We promised our
readers in the outset that we would
fearlessly defend that which was
right, and denounce that which is
wrong. This we have attempted
to do to the best of our ability; at
all times keeping before- us a strict
adherence to the truth, constantly t
endeavoring to "render unto Cse- i
sar the things that are Caesar's,
anrd unto God the things that are
Goi's." It may be that in our
short journalistic career we have
erred, but if so, the only appeal r
we have to make to our patrons is
"That it is human to err, but di
vine to forgive." We are more
than ever convinced that the po
litical party whose principles we
have endeavored to defend and
nmaintain, is the only correct solu
tion to the terrible financial condi
tions now prevailing in this coun
try, and though the scope of our
inluence may be somewhat circum- (
sacribed, when we lay down the c
edltorial pen, our ardor for the f
, cause is not the least abated. We
Shave advocated these prinoiples be- )
caune we believe that we were t
right in so doing, and we are of
the opinion that no honeet man
wants any further warrant for his
totios in the diseh of what he
onweives to be a plain duty. Our
cranCtiism may have at times been ji
severve rad austic, but we hope t
no more so than tha eensure which
deeseirily fotdows the truth plain- ii
ly told. Our short journalistic ex
Iprienc. has taught us one lasting
lesson, that the many and lasting
impressions of friendship, spring
in !r from the social intercourse
with our reader,. makes the part
ing that much the harder to-bear.
We mayu have in the nmetinle
made so ue enemies, this, however,
we are loth to believe. We know
at least that such has not been
clone intentionally ul)on our part.
We only ask a fair and unprejudi
eet l consi deration at tile hands of
our fellow man, with a desire to
- retire from. our field of public la
- hor in peace with all mankind.
\ We have never intended any evil
to any one: we hold no ill will to a
living soul. What we have done
has Ibcell in the interest of justice
and humanity, whether or not we
have accondplished any gi~.l, we
leave the l.ople to judge. We
trust that the good work may go
on until every vestige of tyrany
1 may he swept fromi the face of the
earth. That the freedom and puri
ty of the ballot, in which rests the
liberty of the American pelople
I may be fully restored. It may
I take a long and tedious warfare,
- but with a free speech and a free
Spress coupled with the patriotism
s of the American people. it can and
will be accomplished.
We trust that the great (odl of
the creation may spare us to see
the sun of liberty in its greatest
f refulgence shining upoln a victori
1 ous banner of peace, prosperity
- and happiness for the American
e l olple. We do not know how,
nor when this great social revolu
- tion will end, but we do have the
faith in a just God to deliver his
I people from the thralldroni that
Snow hangs over them in such dark
f gloomy foreoldings. We believe
that every honest m1nn and wolllan
y in this nation will soon be enlisted
I in this great reform movement.
I In conclusion, we will say that
it deeply pain.s us to sever our
i connection with a people whom we
1 so well loved to serve, but it seems
t that fate has so decreed it, as our
I health is in such condition that it
I will not permit us to discharge the
duties of the editorial position on
the PorULtsrT. We deem it but
just to the people, as well as our
1 self to withdraw, in order that
the place nmay be more ably and
competently filled than we are at
this time able to (do. We promise
those who have enlisted in the
r cause of reform to do all in our
Spower to advance the cause, and
I we ask all to lay down prejudices
and calmly and dispassionately in
vestigate the pending issues, and
join in the great fight that is now
going on in the interest of liberty.
With the best wishes and with
- feelings of brotherly love and
kindness we, with much regret,
bid you all adieu.

The Land for the People.
I -- 6
Why does the Peoplc's party de
cdare against the monopolization
of land for speculative purlposes
and demandl that all lands now held
by railroads and other corporations
in excess of their actual needs, and
all lands owned by aliens le re
claimed by the government and
held for actualml settlers only ?
There have been given by cor
rupted congresses to the railroads
of the country 191,t4KI,O(}) acres of
our public land without a penny
of recompense. The railroads now
own aboult 17i,Om,(4, ) acres; own
ed by aliens, 62,(H0),000. These
234,0t0W,000 acres, which is almost
as much as the available land now
owned by the government, the
Populists would reclaim and hold
for homes for American citizens.
One alien landlord, Lord Scully,
Sowns 3,000.000 acres of the best
farm lands of Illinois, from which
he derives a yearly rental of $2)0,
' 000 from his tenant farmers. No
American ought to be compelled
Sto pay rent to a foreigner for the
Suse of part of the soil of his own
country. S9ch a condition is dead
ly poison to patriotism.-N. O.

Since the fright trains have got
in with most of the Populist votes,
Sthe Democratic Impers mare slowly

lit' sail:
" No cla-s of l"Iople are more
intrestedI in the material prosplr
ity of the coidntry."
There is no doubt of this--for
no class gets ai larger share of that
lpro"sperity. The interest the
wolves have in the sheep is pro
found and intense. In fact they
think more about the sheep than
the sheep do alout the il elves.
Their mouths fairly drool when
they contemplate them.
'"Our Ibusiness is inseperably
connected with the conditions of
the world at large, and in fact
with all that ente'rs into the status
of the people."
We should suay so. That is ju,.t
what we have compllained of.
Their business is "inseperably
connected with the condition of
the world at large." It is an
awful condition to-day, an l they
lmve largely ctntril)utet(I to pro
d(uce it. They are the fellows who
circulated petitions to drive silver
out of the mints and who promise'l
the world good times,-they have
got them-for themselves.
"Let as cherish our organization
and by our presence make its
councils and influence to foster
and preserve a system of exchange
that will be the admiration of
every nation and honor to either a
creditor or debtor, and therewith
we shall he content."
That's it. They want to make
their councils an influence. They
have too much influence already.
They own congress as fully as if
they had made the members out
of putty. And they want a cur
rency that will I., the admiration
of the fellow that owes it.
And then ('ol. Ilerrick, presi
dent of a Cleveland savings bank,
proceeded to praise that other na
tional infliction, the daily press.
He said:
"The influence of the press is
best known antl appreciated when
it comnies directly in conjunction
with or in opposition to our busi
ness affairs. Last year the atten
tion of this country, and I might
say of almost the entire civilized
workl, was turned to the subject
of finance. If the policy of many
newspapers helped to plunge us
into our difficulties, the policy of
others have helped to extricate us.
The newspaper press of America
is the one great public institution
which belongs to the people and
yet it is the exclusive property of
individuals. It is, next to ofr
free common schools, the nollest,
the most powerful of all institution,
that have grown out of free play
of intelligence, granted by appeal
ing, not to the prejudices, but to
that better nature which predom
inates in all human beings, and
where it acknowledges to the pub
lic responsibility of justice, hon
esty, truthfulness of public faith,
it takes on divine attributes, and
becomes the first of all in the liber
al professions, for it then voices
the people, and when it voices that
which is best in the people, may
we not then truthfully say that it
expresses the voice and will of
God?"
Oh Lord! What profanity!
The purchased and subsidized daily
papers; owned by foreign and do

ceive that the howl of the lei ieh
for lore cturrenlvcy 1can not he Milluch
longer resisted; but they are deter
mhined that not I dollar of it shall
ever reach the ploCple unless it
comis through them. They will
levy I1 tper cent on it from the
1iophle and ply back to the people
one-half of I lper cent; taking 9u
per cent per annum for standing
between the citizens and their own
government. The constitution
provides that the national govern
ment alone shall create an1neyv-if
any one else attempts it he goes to
prisoen-and :as the government
conies from the peoplle and is the
people, and tax them for the use1
of their own Hmoney! Why don't
they insist that postage stamps
shall not be furnished directly to
the citizens, but shall go throutrh
the banks, and the banks nake a
profit off them :
In God's name what right has
any man to crawl in between the
people alti the governmeut, and
levy taxes (an attribute of the
highest sovereignty) upon the peo
pie, for the use of their own mon
ey ? Why the national bank notes
are printed by the government
(that is, the peoole) on paper fur
nished by the government (thit is
the people), stamped by the United
States, and signed by the officials;
and their only guarantee of pay
ment is redemption in greenbacks,
the people's money, also printed
by the people. It is an incalcula
ble, incredible absurdity that an
intelligent people would permit
their own money to be milked to
them, through the sieve of the
ianks, andi pay heavy interest to
the bankers for holding the strain
er! There might just as well Is' a
law that no man could thresh his
grain unless a banker held the
sacks, and charged him 10 per cent
of the crop for doing so; whether
the farmer wanted him there or
not.
And remember, friends, that the
People's party is the only party in
the United States that propseos
any remedy for this great en
croachment on the rights of the
public.
It declares for greenbacks, full
legal tender, issued directly to the
people, without the intervention
of banks. Why not The green
back must be better than the na
tional bank note, because the note
is redeemable in a greenback; and
surely you can not redeem a supe
rior thing by an inferior. And
this change proposted by the Peo
plie's party, would save the people
of the United States $15,(u40,l0 a
year interest, now paid to national
banks, for getting between the
people and the government and
putting forth an inferior currency
And observe, friends, the bank
ers are determined that, if *your
dire necessities force an increase
of money, that they shall handle it;
an(i that every dollar of it shall
pay tribute to them; andt for this
tribute you will get nothing'
