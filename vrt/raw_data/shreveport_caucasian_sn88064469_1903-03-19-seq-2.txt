D1ECREE OF THE CZAR
The Ruler of Russia Has Issued an
Important Document.
TREATS ON REFORMS.
Those Not Members of Established
Church Are to Be Granted More
Religious Liberty and Vil
lagers to Fare lietter.
St. Petersburg, March 13.-The czar
has issued a decree. It provides for
fredoom of religious worship through
out his dominion, establishes to some
degree local self-government and
makes other concessions to village
committees.
After referring to the efforts of his
predecessors, particularly his father,
to add to the welfare of the Russian
people, the czar announces his decision
to grant freedom of religion to all his
subjects who profess non-orthodox
creeds and to improve conditions of
village life and those of local nobility
and peasantry.
As among the measures outlined for
attainment to these ends is reform
of rural laws, which is to be effected
with the advice of persons who pos
sess the confidence of the people. The
system of administration in various
governments and districts is to be
examined by representatives of differ
ent localities concerned with a view
to effecting necessary amendments.
Measures are also to be taken to re
lieve peasantry of burdens of forced
labor.
The decree, which was issued in
commemoration of the anniversary of
the birthday of Alexander III, is con
sidered to be the most significant act
of state since the emancipation of the
serfs. The public hails it as the pro
clamation of a new era, opening up
bright prospects of early improvement
in Russian internal administration.

plicity and modesty-for he did not
once refer to the Merrimac incident
and impressive by reason of his per
sonality rather than by any oratorical
effects or gestures, and he held the
attention of the audience throughout
his address. *
His subject was "America as a
World Power." Judge Philip Lindsley
Introduced the speaker in a brief talk,
and Captain Hobson began his address.
He dwelt upon the great commercial
growth of the United States, and opti
mistically prophesied that it would
soon be the leader along this line, as
well as numerically, physically and In
tellectually the superior of all other
nations, and that for this reason It
became her natural and logical duty to
assume a foremost place in the adjust
ment of extefrnal complications where
the stronger endeavors to prey on the
weaker.
He advocated an extension of the
fonroe doctrine that would Include
the unenlightened Asiatic countries
and bring them all under the strong
protecting arm of the one country that
advocates the true atruistic principles
of living.
An amusing lnclqent occurred just
as' Captain Hobson began his addresc

some one In he audience sang out.
"Go it, Hobson!" and he responded im
mtediately by, saying, "That's like Tex
