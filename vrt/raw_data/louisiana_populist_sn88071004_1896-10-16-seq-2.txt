Bnllot Thieves.
Of al! the infamous frauds upon
the right of suffrage in this fraud -
ridden State, Rapides parish takes
the cake.
The registration lists at many of
the polls have not been crrected
in 20 years, and the unscrupulous I
scoundrels, who pe:ijure them
selves and disgrace humanity by
falsifying supposed election re
turns that are absolute fiction,
have a list of the names of all the
men living or dead, resident,
transient or absconded, white,
black or indifferent in the country
since the war, and with ghoulish
glee they sit on election day amid
the flow of tobacco juice and
smoke, w hiskey and fonl language,
and stuff votes until the box is
full or the telegraphed majority is
reached, while all the decent peo
ple (and there are somenic) in the
community give the hell holea
wide berth,
Of course the scoundrels who
revel in such fiendish sports would
not yield their debauching pas"
times to any agreement that pro
posed to give Populists, Republi
cans. !'emocrats or any one else
a fair election, for if they should
their occupation would be gone
and they would have nothing to I
sell to the dirty politicians and un.
scrupulous office seekers.
But there are men passing for
honest, decent citizens who back 1
these scoundrels and who cou!d I
control them or else remove them I
from power and pat honest people
in their stead. Then behind these
is Governor Foster who appointed I
such men to conduct elections, and t
facing them are the courts whose I
duty it is to preserve civilization
by punishing crime.
That these forces are not effec
ively applied is the fault of pub
lic sentiment and the honest peo
ple in that and adjoining parishes.
To this court of last resort must
the Fusion committee appeal in
behalf of honest elections in Rap
ides, their demand upon the prop
er authorities for same and for a
redemption of their pledges to the
Populists of a fair deal having
failed.
If this is done and the proper
vigilance is exercised by those in
terested in fair elections and the
good name of Rapides and Rap
ides Democrats, this blot upon civ
ilization and the body politic can
be wiped out, or the poor, misera- a
ble instruments in it put behind I
the bars where they belong.
The area of fraud is reduced to
seven precincts and can be easily
encompassed so as to either pre
vent the crimes or prove them.
We would claim this as a viola
tion of the Fusion agreement and
advise Popalists to retaliate in
whatever way seemed good to
them, but that the Democratic Fu
sion committee immediately com
meneed to do all it could to cor
rect the evil and will eontinue in
that direction, and for the further
fact that there is room to believe
this a covert movein the interest
of McKinley and the gold standard
as we know several leading spirits
in that parish to be gold men, who
arq doubtless backed by the Louis
iana Democrat, which says it it
votes the Democratic ticket it will
scratch the four Populist electors
thereon.
Under these circumstances Pop
nlists cannot afford to play into
their hands by voting against Bry.
an and Free silver.
We sincerely hope that the No- tl
vember election will be a fair one, am
and we have every reason to be- ei
lieve that it will. Though sincere
ly desiring the success of Bryan al
and silver, and earnestly wishing li
that the electoral vote of Louisiana vi
may figare in their victorious col- ne
amn when the returns of the elec- ft
tioc are compiled, we shall shed id
no tears to see the State accredited al
to McKinley it it can not be car- ti
ried for Bryan byother than fraud- it
klent means. As a valued ex- a
change has maid : "The luxury ot al
emjoyin one honest election in di
Louisima will more than compen- w
m-e for any disappointment the ti
outoame may emtail."-Verinlion p

Special To The Popnulist.
Washington, D. C. Oct. loth, '9i6.
I)iuriniu the last week a joint
electoral ticket has been arranged
in West Virginia, by which the
Populists e"t the two Electors-at
large. and the I)emocrats the four
D)istrict electors. This arrange
ment nmakes West Virginia certain,
while before the McKinley people
were claiming the State. So far
joint electoral tickets have been
made in twenty-eight states, in
nearly everyone of which the Peo
ple's party has secured a larger
proportion of the electoral vote
than than the strength of the res
poective parties would seem to jus
tify.
The Republicans are greatly
chagrined over the arrangement
recently made in Indiana and West
Virginia. Through their emissa
ries they did every thing in their
power to prevent joint electoral
tickets from being made in these
two states; and now have these
same emissaries at work in these
two-states, as well as in nearly
every other state, trying to breed
dissensions and get as many demo
crats and populists as possible to
rebel against these joint electoral
tickets, under one pretext or an
other. In fact, joint electoral
tickets have been arranged in a
sufficient number of states to make
the defeat of McKinley and the
gold standard certain. Mark Han
na realizes that his only hope now
is to try to prevent the people
from supporting these joint elec
toral tickets. The patriotism of
the voters can be depended upon,
however, to defeat this last hope
and scheme to fasten the gold stan
dard upon the nation.
HOW THE SITUATION STANDS.
The outlook has greatly improv
ed during the last ten days. The
reaction has set in all over the
country against the republican
boodle campaign. - The masses of
the voters have begun to realize
that the monopolists and trusts are
putting up millions of dollars to
try to buy the election in order
that these trusts and monopolists
can fatten upon the masses of the
people for another four years.
Information received at headquar
ters of the People's party and of
the Democratic party, so far, indi
cate that the following states are I
almost absolutely safe, with the I
prospects brightening each d.y.

The above states which are now h
reaseonably certain for Bryan, with
a certainty of gaining steadily to
the election, gives two hundred
and thirty-two electoral votes, or
eight more than enough to elect.
It will be noticed that in the
above table is not included states
like Illinois, with twenty-four
votes; Delaware with three; Min
nesota with nine; Michigan with
fourteen, and Iowa with thirteen.
In these states Bryan's chances are
at least even. In fact, if the elec
tion was to take place to-morrow, I
it is almost certain that he would
carry several of these states, if not
all of them, and there is every in
dication that the silver sentiment
will be stronger in these states on
th third of November than at
pereet. Thus t will be seen that
Bryan can be elected it all of thee

nes, as it has set mn doring the,, !nat
ten days, Ilryan will have votes to
spare in the electoral college. To
(ay, even Ohio is tremblling in the
balance, and may go for Bryan.
As we have said above, there is,
in fact, but one dlanger now, and
that is Hanna's efforts to try to
get dissentions on the joint electo
ral tickets.
LABOR VOTE LINING UP AGAINST
MCKINLEY.
The information received at
headquarters show that thec labor
vote will probably vote more unit
ed this year than ever before.
The efforts at coercion and intimi
dation by the employers of labor
was never greater than it is this
year, and the manhood of the la
boring man is now beginning to
rebel against his master, who, not
satisfied with making him an in
dustrial slave, is now trying to
make him a political vassal also.
The gold people made an appoint
ment a few days ago for Powderly,
in Chicago, advertised him as a
great labor leader, and did every
thing in their power to get the la
boring men out to hear him. But
the laboring people ,believinz that
Powderly was in the pay of their
enemy, refused to go out to hear
him. lie had only a handful of
people in a large Opera House.
Information is received from a
number of points where emissaries
are sent to talk to laboring men in
the interest of the gold standard,
to the effect that the results of all
these efforts have been to arouse
the manhood of the laboring men
and make them come out boldly
and declare for Bryan and silver.
The state election in Florida
shows a falling off in the demo
cratic vote. It is understood that
the two great Railway systems in
that state will do everything in
their power to give the electoral
vote of their state to McKinley.
But if a joint electoral ticket can
be arranged there, the state is safe.
THE GEORGIA ELECTION.
In answer to a telegram receiv
ed from the Evening Journal of
Atlanta, to-day, Chairman Butler
sent tne following dispatch to that
paper, which gives the view of
headquarters here concerning the
Georgia election. It is as follows:
The Evening Journal, Atlanta,
Georgia.
It is almost certain that a major
ity of the white votes of Georgia
was cast for the People's party
State ticket. This is a great gain
over the party's last vote, and is
due to the personal popularity of
Tom Watson in his own state, and
to the desire of the people to re
buke the management of the Dem
ocratic party in the state affairs of I
Georgia. Evidently the demo
cratic party is indebted to the ne
gro vote for whatever kind of vic
tory they have won.
The outlook for Bryan and free
silver is much better than it was
ten. days ago. The reaction
against the schemes and methods
of the Republican party has al
ready set in and will grow in force
until the day of election. This
proves the impotency of a boodle
campaign when the people are
aroused on a great and vital issue.
The present indications show two
hundred and thirty-two electoral
votes reasonably certain for Bryan,
with at least an equal chance for
seventy.five mere.

Editor Populist :-I am much
gratitied to see that the great
Democratic party has adjusted its
politic al tenets more in accordance
with our political views, and what
we conceive to be the best for our
country. We can now give the
democratic candidate for ;president
our heariy support, as we are in
perfect accord for a revenue tariff
and free silver.
And your action in connection
with the chairman of the democra
tic committee has recognized our
political importance and placed us
on a ground of perfect equality,
and I think under this arrange
ment we will have a fair election.
Now let every patriot and lover
of his country keep his shoulder to
the wheel for success. Success
can only be guaranteed by unan
imity of action and concert of ef
fort. Let us do our whole duty,
nothing more or less. I now think
Mr. Bailey will stand a good chance
for election to Congress as we see a
fair count in seight. A long pull,
a sure pull and a pull all together
and we will win.
Respectfully.
