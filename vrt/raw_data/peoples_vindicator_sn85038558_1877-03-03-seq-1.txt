ates all frictlion at the ends of the cotfton

gives a LARGER YIELD OF LINT fromn
the same amtonnt of Smd than any other
Gin in use. The Revolvin le Ieadl light
tens the draft and caunes tihe Gin to run
faster with less driving power, thus do
ing a great deal more work within the
s mo time, while ecoionmizhing steami or
animal power, than anyother Gin. The
seed I ein g ginned very close, the length
of the staple is increased, producing ot -
ton on this ecounnt of a greater lmarket
v'alue. This improved value, given by
length of staple, with extra prod(uction
of lint, added to increased amount of
wok done, more than covers the cost
of the Gin in every 1010 1,ahes gined.

hanisted its methlds of resistance ios

Tilhen, anl that it is prepared to
peatcealily acqniesce in the in:ugn

as now organized, \ill bet inevitably o
disrulpted, and its pirestige Ifor the I

There has never been a imore dis- t
graceful oveirtlro,v than t!it which
the national D)eimocratic party has
imelt witl. The greattness of its for
tunes; the mighty trusts it held ; tilet
tnagiiittude of tlie Issues it rpreselnt
ed ; its noble hi-stori and 1ieroic coiº
t,'fats, onrly serve to lshow th pitiful
itess of its fall, and the cowardice
which paralyzed its arm in the su
'ºemne hourll of its destiny.
The iecent el ection was a clear and s
1 emphatic Irepudiation of the lliplpub
lican party by the American people :
the election of Tilden was, as we havive
sai It , before ill these coluiies, thel
gradle,.rt civil victory ever wtrn over
atlvaing cenltralism. Pt lthl e par- t
It which won it \\ as lnot equal to the, a
lealntHess of its folrtunles. The n11- a
anent the le.aders o1 the ldelfcate, par
itv begni thtreteining to maintain i
their power by force, the leaders of i
te tliniiphanst larty began to plate
If tI eit icessity of peace a ; d of deter
miuilg the onillttoversy b1,y "a it hi
e retion. The ,ill creating the Elec- 't
t 'Olll comulii n j wa n J e wardllyIv sll. ti
tifugle of ilth triumpi,hanlt party to c1
evade the iesiuponsibility of iUtSnta I ti
inng its victory, the supnlemney of thlle
constitutiton, and the well settled
usages of the Government. And
iInally, when the (Commissio, whlich ti
the Democrats created tllemselves, Iby in
its bold and arlitrary rulings rever
sell the result of the election, u:fi th
out leadership or Colrage, they liter'
ally abandoned the struggle and sub- t
initted to the frand.
Tle South must now look to her t'
own interests. Louisiana has n,
longer any tie that binds her dtstin
ies to the tottnues of the National t1
Delnocracy. The party has abdicaled
lthe potcer she and the other Sotcth(rn
States elerated her,' to. Abdicated it '
not as Dioie-tian or Charles V. ab
tdienated their i'nlirprial thr ones; not it
in the day of power, when there werer
no great duties to desert ; but in tili
face of danger ; in the manlllner of a
coward; aye, it sliink out of power t
to escape the resplonsibility of main
taining the great cause Ihat was in I
its hands. From such it party Lou- a
isiauai has notling to expect.
The Republican party upon the
other hand holds the goverminient by
lawless means, except in so far as the
folly of the D)emocrats legalized its
lawlessness thllrough the electoral bill ;
Mr. Hayes will hlold the presid'ency
by a frand ; his Administration will
bie tainlted to the end with fraud. But
if we were foirced to chloose between
it government whose title was based
in frand, and otie inspired by cow
ardice, we shoutld choose the folnter.
Gi(eat and beietieent policies haive
soimetinies been established by got'
er-rnien ts iased on force, but we ]tlniv
of no great or Ibencficelt thiing tliat
has ever emanated floml cowalrdice in
governlment, thouigl tlhat govern
ament were frlified by i'iistitulions,
legitimate suecessioni asid utIdispu-i
ted iuijorities of the people.
If tlien (oV. Hayes sllill ie made
President thn'ongh frand, tlhogil Gov.
Tilden was fairly electedl, :and tile
goverinlnent, biased in fraid, shall
adopt a wise and Iiber al policy to
ward thlio Soitt, recogliing the

played by thie l)emocratic party, we
are not prteparllud to sIy that tlhe rie
sult will ie unsatisfactory or uiiufor
tuatiate to tlhisA section of the Union.
I Had Gov. Tilden been made Pres
ident, tihe Soutlheru States would, in
tihe nature of thlinigs, have been idei

party and it, policy. With its weak
andt timlorons spirit, displtyed in the
