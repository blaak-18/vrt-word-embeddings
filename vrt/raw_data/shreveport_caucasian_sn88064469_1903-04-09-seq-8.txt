CHANGES IN OHIO.
Republican and Democralic Parties Maide
an Almost Even Break.
Cincinnati, April S.-While the ag
gregate pluralities in Ohio cities show
Republican gains, parties break a'most
even on changes of local administra
tions. The most noted changes from
Democrats to Republicans are at Col
umbus, Mansfield, Zanesville, Defiance.
Delphos, Vanwert and Shelby, the Re
publicans carrying Shelby for the firzt
time. Among cities that changed from
Republican to Democratic mayors
were Youngstown, Springfield, Marion.
Troy. and probably Findlay. There are
seventy-one cities and 615 villages in
Ohio. Of the sixty largest cities heard
from officially, it was noted that Re
publicans and Democrats each carried
thirty. In the notable exception of
Toledo, Jones, the independent mayor.
will have little authority, as the Re
publicans control all the city govern
ment except mayor.

TO(O OF ONE STATE
President -Roosevelt Visit Several
South Dakota Cities.
DOZEN OF SPEECHES.
One Feature of the Day Was Great
Number of Children in the Vari
ous Audiences and Whom
He Referred To.
Aberdeen, S. D., April 8.-President
Roosevelt traversed South Dakota and
made more stops Monday than any
other day during his trip. He
began at Sioux Falls in the morning
and ended his twelfth speech in the
evening at Aberdeen. The speeches
were confined for the most part to
the tariff and to material prosperity
of the country. The president was ac
corded a cordial welcome at the differ
ent stopping places and at many sta
tions, where the train did not stop, the
crowds gathered and cheered as the
special train sped by. One feature of
the day was the large number of chil
dren in the var:ous audiences and the
president referred to them several
times, saying that he was glad to see
that the stock was not aying out
The president had as his guests dur
ing the day Senators Kittredge and
Gamble and Representative Martin
and Representative Burke. the South
Dakota delegation in congress.
At Tulare the president departed
from his usual custom and descending
from his car, shook hands with the
people gathered at the station.
Yankton was the first stop after the
train left Sioux Falls. To the multi
tude at Yankton the president spoke
on the tariff and the qualities of good
citizenship.
At Mitchell the president made the
longest address of the day. His au
dience was large and his speech was
frequently interrupted by applause. He
here discussed the work of individuals
and the important part they play in
the upbuilding of the nation.
WAS REVERSED.
t. United States Supreme Court Passes on
an Oklahoma Territory Case.
Washington, April 8.-Justice White
delivered the opinion of the United
States supreme court in the case of
Thos. W. Potter vs. Mary Hale. invotv
ing claims to land in Oklahom4 terri
tory growing out of the rush to settle
P newly opened land in. 1889. Potter was
n employed on an Indian reservation ad
joining the land as a police officer. Act
e ing in that capacity he ordered off the
, lIand he afterward located on, people
who had gone upon it prior to the hour
e fixed for the stampede. When that
d hour arrived he joined in the rush
and as he had only a quarter of a mile
to travel, reached it in advance of the
others.
The location was contested. The
n court held that as he had taken part
_-in the rush to the coveted land and
) -had gone upon it from the outside he
. was entitled to the prize and had won.
| The decision of the supreme court of
d Oklahoma, which was against Potter.
was reversed. The court affirmed the
I opinion of the supreme court of Okla
I homr in the case of Robert L Wine
brenner vs. Edward C. Forney which
I was another "'sooner" case. Forney
located on land in the Cherokee strip
when that section was opened, enter
ing from the Ponca Indian reserva
tion, which was claimed to have been
- prohibited territory.

Cinacneti, April 8.-Judge Lurton
on Monday conceded the reading of
his op.kion in the suit making appli
cation to restrain the Union Pacific
from voting its 900,000 shares in the
Southern Pacifice election that had
been set for April & and for other re
fief. The decision was a refusal to
grant the injunction and to afford the
relief asked. The opinion, which was
quite lengthy, was against the con
I tention of the complainants that the'
Union Paciic was a necessary or an
actual party to the suit even though
airma Harriman of the Union Pa
ic e board of directors had made an

OHIO ELECTIONS.
Wnsion Tickets as a Rule Were befea6e4
In the Various Cities.
Cincinnati, O.. April 8.-While the
Republicans had material gains in the
municipal elections in Ohio, they did I
not secure many changes in the admin
istration of the cities. The most no
table exception was at Columbus,
where Mayor Hinkle, Democrat, is suc
ceeded by Jeffreys, Republican. The
mayors of all the leading cities except
Columbus were re-elected. The Re
publicans retained control of Cincin
nati and the Democrats of Cleveland
and Samuel M. Jones was elected as
an independent for the fourth time
as mayor of Toledo. The Democrats
re-elected their tickets at Dayton, San
dusky, Chillicothe. Hamilton and other
cities normally Democratic, cnd the
Republicans at Stuebenvilie, Youngs
town, Warren, Ironton, Portsmouth
and other towns that they have hither
to controlled. The winning tickets
were of either of the dominant parties.
The fusion tickets as a rule were de
feated in a dozen Or more cities where
they were in the field. One of the -
most noted gains of tth Republicans
»'as at Mansfield and of the Demo
crats it Springfield. where local is
sues controlled results as was the
case in most of the changes. There is
much diversity of opinion as to the
effect of these municipal elections up
on the next Republican nomination for
governor. but it is conceded that
Mayor Tom L. Johnson of Cleveland,
will now become a formidable candi
date for the Democratic nomination for
gov~rior shortly, and that the In
galls organization will be continued
with a view to making him a Demo-.
cratic opponent of Hanna for the sen
atorship.
