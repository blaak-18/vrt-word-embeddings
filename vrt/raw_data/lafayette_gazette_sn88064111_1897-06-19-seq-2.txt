DEA T OF ARCHBISHOP
JANSSENS.
The people of Lafayette, particu
larly the Catholics, were shocked
last Sunday morning to hear that
Archbishop Janssens had died at
sew on board the steamer Creole,
while on his way to Holland where
he was going to visit his native
town.
The beloved churchman had, by
reason of his splendid qualities, at
tained a most enviable place in the
affections of the people of this
State. His uniformly kind manner
had won for him the love of all he
came in contact with, and the mag
nificent administrative ability in the
management of the affairs of his
diocese challenged the admiration
of everyone. The zeal that the de
ceased churchman alway s displayed
in the performance of his important
duties as the head of the New Or
leans diocese, the manner in which
he adjusted the serious differences
which arose during his administra
tion, the purity of his life, his pro
found intellect, the fervor of his
religion, his untiring energy, his
broad mind and big heart made him
the ideal archbishop.
There is only one Populist judge
in Louisiana. His name is
Machem, he lives in Winn and is
a crack-a-jack. He opens court at
7:30 a. m. and keeps open until
sundown.
We are not very well informed on
spiritual matters, but it strikes us
that if Gardes had been a friend of
Girault he would have tried to keep
him out of the penitentiary. It is
very likely that Girault would have
been willing to take his chances in
the next world.
When Sheriff McLain, of Urbana,
Ohio, telegraphed to Governor
Bushnell for troops the latter re
phlied that he had ordered the col
ored company of Springfiield to go
at once to Urbana. Sheriff Mc
Lain very wisely remonstrated
against the appearance of a negro
company on the scene of trouble.
It would seem that the Northern
people are just beginning to get a
dose of the medicine which they
have been trying to cram down the
throats of the Southern people these
many years. Negro soldiers shoot
ing downi white men in the act of
defending their homes against the
assaults of black monsters ! What
an edifying spectacle !
The old howl about pauper labor
has been raised again.
The meanest man yet, says the
Homer Clipper, is the animal who
takes his home paper for a year
without paying for it and then re
fuses to take it out of the post
office. There are some of these
men in this parish, but we are glad
to know that they are few.-St.
Landry Clarion.
And then the execrable meanness
of the abominable brute is further
more shown by contemptibly sneak
ing around the corner to read his
neighbor's paper.
We doubt if there is a single
newspaper in Louisiana but what
will join the Shreveport Progress in
its desire to see none but those who
are morally and politically honest
placed in office. The great diffi
culty, however, we imagine, is to
secure a consensus of opinion on
the question as to who is honest,
politically and otherwise. The
matter is necessarily left to indi
vidual opinion and judgment, and
on this as on all other questions of
men and measures, there always
has been and ever will be, a differ
ence of oApinion.-Catahoula News.
Exactly. For instance, our esti
mable friend of the Progress thinks
Dominick C. O'Malley is a good
sFort of a fellow, while there are
some nice people int Louisiona who
entertain a very different opinion of
the Item's proprietor. It is a ques
tion of individual judgment. That's
all.
EXPORT BOUN"TY ,FOR
FARMERS.
Iberia Enterprise.
The efforts of a majority of the
American people to tax themselves
into prosperity is resulting in a
multitude of schemes. One of the
latest was presented in the U. S.
Senate, on Thursday last during the
debate on the tariff, by Senator
Connon, of Utah, one of the Re
publican senators who deserted his
party in the last presidential elec
tion. He has become a convert to
the views of Lubin, the advocate of
an export bounty on agricultural
products, and thie speech which he
made in support of his amendment
to the tariff bill was one 'f the
ablest that has been delivered in
the Senate for many years. In fact
Mr. Cannon has suddenly come to
the front as the champion of the
farmers, and his defense of their
cause was a brilliant and cogent
effort. The amendment he offered
to pay a bounty on the exportation
of agricurtural productions was de
feated by a vote of 59 to xo.
Two Democrats, Roach, of North
Dakota, and Tillman, of South
Carolina, voted for it, and Mc
Laurin, of South Carolina, would
have supported it had he been
present. The Populists voted for
the amendment, as did also two
other silver Republicans, Mantle
ane Pettigrew, besides Connon.
Calculated upon the basis of the
exports for the calendar year 896
it would cost the government an
nually over $47,000,000 to pay the
proposed bounty, of which over
$23,00oo0o,ooo would go to cotton ex
porters.
The result of all such legislation
is to tempt the strong and powerful
to intrench himself so as to reap
largely of the benefits thus confer
red by the government. The tariff
has built up a powerful manufactur
ing class; the export bounty scheme
would for a time benefit the small
farmers, but would eventually have
the same effect that the tariff has
had-the gradual stifling of the
small and weak by consolidated
monopoly, that would turn the
American farmer into a tenant and
industrial serf to a far greater ex
tent than he already is, and thus
would be hastened the work of
sapping the foundation of the
American Republic by the more
rapid increase of a large dependent
mass on the one hand and a small
privileged class on the other. This
is an European condition which can
only be averted by a return to more
natural conditions of trade and
legislation.
The friends of General Gordon
in all parts of the South will be in
terested to know that he is now en
gaged upon a history of the war to
be written in a style somewhat dif
ferent from anything that has yet
appeared on that most interesting
period of our national life, The
general will travel somewhat out of
the beaten tracks and give the story
of the war as it was seen by "the
boys in the trenches." Instead of
dealing in statastics and in the dry
technical criticisms of campaign
strategy, he will give only so much
of this as is necessary, but his chief
effort will be to depict the American
soldier in all his phases of camp
and field life, in this the most mo
mentous struggle of all the ages.
The forthcoming book will be
looked forward to with much
pleasure .by veterans of both the
great armies as well as by their pos
terity, and it may be said that in
manykespects it will be the most
notable book issued from the press
in many years.-Baton Rouge Ati
vocate.

DEMO.CRATIC PRESS CLU !B.
The following from the Baton
Rouge Advocate should meet with
the approval of every Democratic
paper in Louisiana:
,"Our neighbor Truth suggests the
formation in this State of a Demo
cratic Press Club to be composed
of such Democratic editors as de
sire to go into such an organiza
tion for the purpose of holding pe
riodical meetings and conferring to
gether on such subjects as might be
of interest to the Democratic iess.
Such organizations flourish id" al
most every State in which two or
more strong parties exist and as
there are so many papers in this
State that do not claim to be Demo
cratic an organization of the char
acter proposed might be of valuable
service to the party as well as to the
newspapers composing it. The
Populists newspapers we be
lieve maintain an organization in
this State, and it would appear that
the time is ripe for the Democratic
papers to get together and formu
late some plan whereby unity of ac
tion may be maintained in the party
fight. Of course such an organiza
tion should in no wise conflict with
the State Press Association which
organization would include all the
newspaper organizations that might
be formed, but this latter organiza
tion should only be designed with a
view to securing unity among the
Democratic press of the State
touching all questions of party na
ture. The idea of our neighbor we
believe to be a good one and we
suggest that, should the proposition
meet with the approval of a suffi
cient number of the Democratic
editors, Brother McGrath might
call a meeting at some convenient
point for the purpose of effecting an
organization."

heads, envelopes, we will print
them.
The Roseland Herald makes these
sensible remarks "A newspaper
without enemies is scarcely deserv
ing of friends. The vicious and
lawless never like a bold, fearless
newspaper, and every self-respect
ing publisher should be proud of
their enmity. There are other
newspaper foes, however, who are
far more troublesome and conse
quently more to be feared. First
and foremost is the man who owes
the newspaper an honest debt and
will not pay it. Then there is the
ambitious mortal who wants an of
fice and complains because the
newspaper cannot consistently
champion his cause; he is pretty
likely to become an enemy. The
man who wants to shape the policy
of a paper and is not allowed to do
so, is a sure enemy. But the mean
est enemy is the man whom the
newspaper has befriended, and who
deliberately condemns she sheet af
ter securing from it all the assis
tance he possibly can. The news
paper can, to some extent, respect
an open and avowed enemy, but an
ingrate, under any circumstances,
in beneath contempt."
A remarkable trial has just been
concluded in Atlanta, Ga., John
Tyler Cooper, a descendent of J.
Fannimore Cooper, a relative of
President John Tyler, a member of
the Society of the Cincinnati, ex
mayor of Atlanta and a mnan of the
highest social prominence, has been
convicted of embezzlement and
sentenced to serve tlree months in
jail and pay a fine of $500. He
has held offices of trust and emolu
ment since r868. His last and
lengthiest incumbency was that of
clerk to the Board of County Com
missioners. It was while holding
this position that he became short
in his accounts to the extent of
$2ooo. He was in Costa Rica
when the discovery was made but
came home and settled up. The
Judge ordered a prosecution never
theless, with the results given.
The case will be appealed.

The New Iberia Election.
The Democrats claim that they
were victorious at the recent muni
cipal election held at New Iberia,
but the Republicans got their man
in for the office of chief of police.
A special from New Iberia to the
Times-Democrat of June 8 says:
"The election here to-day for a
City Council and chief of police
was an unsually quiet one, but the
voting was spirited. The contest
centred on the chief of police, three
candidates being in the field. Char
gois, the present incumbent, on the
straight Democratic ticket; Patin,
independent Democrat, and Carter,
the Republican nominee. The vote
all the way through was extremely
close, resulting as follows: Patin
zz8, Carter xa6, Chargois zz6.
The following Council, which
selects its mayor from among their
number, were elected: John Fish
er, Jules Dreyfus, P. R. Duperier,
U. A. Patin, W. R. Burke, John
Lamperez, E. J. Cartsens. Total
vote cast, 395-"
