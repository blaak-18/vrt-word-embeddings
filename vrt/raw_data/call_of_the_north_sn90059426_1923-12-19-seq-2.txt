PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND NECESSARY LEGISLATION:
HISTORY MANIPULATIONS.
On Tuesday, November 3, a delega
tion officially representing numerous
civic and educational organizations
called on President Ooolidge and
strongly urged his support to a mea
sure substantially identical with the
Towner-Sterling Bill whose enact
ment of the Roman hierarchy as the
enemy of public education has pre
vented more than five years. .
The delegation assured the Presi
dent that such a measure will be in
troduced early in the ensuing session.
It will provide for a department of
education in the President’s Cabinet
and for federal aid to the States in
removing illiteracy, Americanizing
the foreign-born among us, advance
ment of physical education, and
equalization of educational oppor
tunity throughout the nation. The
following organizations were repre
sented by those who called on the
President:
National Education Asociation.
American Association of University
Women.
National Congress of Mothers and
Parent-Teachers Associations.
General Federation of Women’s
Clubs.
American Library Association.
International Sunday School Coun
cil of Religious Education.
National Council of Jewish Women.
National Women’s Christian Temp
erance Union.
National Board of Young Women’s
Christian 'Association.
Many Masonic National Organiza
tions.
Order of the Eastern Star.
Daughters of the American Revolu
tion.
Women’s Relief Corps.
National Committee for a Depart
ment of Education.
National League of Women Voters.
National Council of Women.
National Federation of Business
and Professional Women’s Clubs.
National Federation of Music
Clubs.
American Federation of Labor.
American Federation of Teachers.
National Women’s Trade Union
League.
A number of City and State School
Superintendents. ...
The proposed measure means ample
express provision against the possi
bility of federal interference with
State management of the schools and
of all funds used for their mainten
ance. Educational functions of the
federal Government are now confined
to a obscure bureau in the Interior
Department. Until quite recently
that bureau was crowded into a dark
and chilly corner of the lobby of the
old Pension Office. It is now in the
office building of the Interior De
partment.—Tri-State American,
would cast over the whole nation a
glaring light of old-time independ
ence.
The newly revised Muzzey text,
which is acceptable only to such su
perintendents as were satisfied with
the avowedly Anglicized edition, is
the object of especia 1 patriotic pro
test in and about New York City;
National Chairman Joyce of the
Americanization committee, Veterans
of Foreign Wars, and the New York
state officials of the American Le
gion have directed all post command
ers in -New York state to file with
school authorities the protests of
their posts against the new Muzzey
text and to employ other measures,
if necessary, against its use.
It is possible that a monster mass
meeting in Madison Square Garden
may be called by these veterans and
other patriotic organizations to make
ringing protest against treason teach
ings in the public schools, and to give
school superintendents who support
these-teachings opportunity to ac
count for their favoritism.
In this event Judge Wallace Mc-
Camant, past president general, Sons
of the American Revolution, end
chairman of the national committee
on patriotic education, will come from
Portland, Ore., to make the chief Ad
dress voicing the national sentiment
for the preservation of true history.
National Chairman Joyce’s letter
to V. F. W. post commanders reads in
part as follows:
“The school history committee, act
ing under indorsement and instruction
of the Norfolk national encampment,
has carefully examined the new revi
sion of D. S. Muzzey’s 'American
History* and finds it little, if any,
better than the 1920 edition that has
been so generally condemned as un
truthful and dangerous in its teach
ings to School children.
“Prof. Muzzey has allowed to stand
uncorrected in his hew book innum
-erable omissions and ous
right falsifications that . have been
pointed out and protested against in
resolutions in national meetings of
this and practically alt other patriot
ic organizations, as fell as by many
civic bodies and fraternal orders all
over the country.
“In New York City schools the
Muzzey situation is complicated by
the facts that while other accused
texts were banned eighteen months
ago, the Muzzey book was protected
and retailed, and when further pres
sure last spring forced recognition of
its faults two New York superintend
ents assisted Professor Muzzey in its
revision and thus lent official indorse
ment to the product that is repugnant
to patriotic sense.
“One of the superintendents has
since retired, but the other stands at
the head of American history teach
ing in the New York City schools.
“It has been insolently asserted by
speakers for foreign propaganda
agencies andby some college profes
sors and school men that the interpre
tation of American patriotism should
be left to ‘higher historical scholar
ship,’ and that ‘ignorant’ and narrow
ly ‘nationalistic’ American patriotic
organizations should keep their hands
off.
“We contend, on the contrary, that
we who have followed the flag for
American ideals know what these
ideals are; we cherish them for what
they are, and will maintain them in
our schools as zealously as we have
maintained them on battle line.
“The public school.is the first line
of defense of democracy. Let us keep
it loyal.
“You, a 3 commander, and all mem
bers of your post are earnestly urged
to employ every honorable means to
impress upon your public school au
thorities the offensiveness of the Muz
zey history.
“We are assured that many other
organizations and a very large ma
jority of enlightened people are work
ing with us, from the same high mo
tives and to the same purpose.”
Misapprehension Abroad
In New Jersey the protest against
the Muzzey and other obnoxious his
tories is soon to be made effective
through a combined state-wide drive.
Heads of all patriotic organizations
have recently met at Trenton and
united in a co-operative action.
In Los Angeles a special commit
tee of public school superintendents
and teachers, created a year ago to
investigate the Muzzey, Hart and
West texts, used in California, has
reported that none of these is any
longer in use in Los Angeles.
Current comment in the press of
England indicates a misapprehension
that the patriotic protest in our coun
try against the Anglicized histories
has been prompted by anti-British
feeling and by a new spirit for an ex
aggerated American nationalism.
This error in England is to be de
plored. Mutual understanding and
genuine, accord between the two peo
ples can have no better basis than
truths, past as well as present.
There has been no demand of de
sire that any foreign nation be dis
credited or misrepresented on our
school histories, or that any new na
tionalistic spirit be generated, or
that there be made any alterations
whatsoever in the long acceted teach
ing of our annals.
The sole demand has been that
American history and American na
tional spirit, precisely as they have
developed through the past, be pre
served.
No complaint rests against whole
some desire to promote Anglo-Ameri
can amity.
But this worthy desire does not
justify the outright vandalism at
tempted upon our history. Nothing
can justify misrepresentation of the
causes and conduct of the Revolution,
defamation of our nation’s founders,
perversion of their doctrines and dis
tortion of their ideals to the minds of
American children.

NY THE KLANKEEPS GROWING
BY BERT E. THOMAS
Great Plenipotentiary, Realm of Alabama- v
With all tiie persecution and acca- eager and willing to become one of its
sations, charges and whatnots that members.
has been buried at the Knights of the The twelfth Chapter of Romans, is
Ku Klux Klan by the Governors of
Oklahoma. .Louisiana,' and other
states, doubtless many people
throughout the entire United States
oftimes wonder why the Knights of
he Ku Klux Klan continues to grow,
and increase its membership by tens
of thousands every year.
The answer to this, is indeed very
simple. A house that is built on a
solid rock foundation will never be
undermined, and so it is with the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
A thing or an Undertaking, or a
movement thus fundamentally right
cannot be destroyed, and especially
so by those who draw on their imagin
tion or jump at conclusions and this
to my mind has been the case in every
instance where this great organiza
tion has been subjected to unmerciful
persecution and criticism.
Jesus Christ leads our way, and he
i- ever before us, and we fully real
ize without His guidance we could do
nothing. The cross of the Savior is
our beacon light, and He will forever
lead us in a righteous way, driving
for an objective with a thought for
ever in our hearts, of not for self,
but for others.
If the Klan did not take for its cri
terion of character Jesus Christ, is
could not have possibly lived and
grown as H has..
Beal men who know what the Klan
stands for, and regardless of this
present persecution will tell you that
it is the greatest organization in
America today, and the only organiza
tion of pure Anglo-Saxon Native born
white Protestant and Gentile Ameri
cans, whose' sires and dames of a gen
eration ago laid the foundation of this
government, and that it is the only
organization that will save the Unit
ed States of America from its enem
ies within and without.
It is a fact that can be proven a
thousand times over that the alien
who has been prone to criticise, but
at the same time was fair minded
enough x o get'the facts about this or
ganization and what it stands for were
NEWER AND BETTER DAY
There is going to be a chance,
Son of Man has told;
As I lie asleeoing, the Spirit of Truth
unfold.
God in His infinite wisdom has open
ed wide the gate
And to us He is revealing life after
death apd its fate.
Oh! For the Truth we are seeking, as
our spirit friends well know,
And to us He is revealing as to merit
of faith we show.
We seek, we look and we wonder at
the things we don’t understand,
But when we have learned our lesson,
we’ll be willing to obey life’s com
mand.
For the beauty of life over yonder is
nearing us day by day,
When we will be changed and not
ponder; accept the goal as we may,
As we enter that world of mystery,
we’ll think of our days on earth
And look on a glorious future with
joy and with mirth.

HOW TO PREPARE A

When half done, beat'well if they
do not seem to be “tendering up,”
tho’ the American variety will usually
simmer down without beating. A lit

addition, as it is a help in making
them “go ’round.”
When they seem to be thoroughly
done, set them aside and let them
stand (on the Eighteenth Amend
ment) until safely ready to use; hus
bands prepared, in this manner will
keep a long time—sometimes longer
than you want to keep them.

The CALL OF THE NORTH
the Klansman’s guide and each Klans
man must live up to its teachings.
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
from an official point of view never
has and never will place its stamp of
approval on any form of law viola
tion, neither have they ever attempt
ed to enforce the law on the statute
books of this country .only insofar as
lending their aid and support to the
regular constituted authorities.
As the old saying goes, “A burnt
child fears the fire,” and by that token
with a little investigation it wili be
seefl without any excepion that those
who are continually trying to destroy
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are
those that the Klan say enmasses are
the ones if they have their way would
destroy this, the greatest government
on earth, mainly the Catholics, who
are governed by he Pope of Rome,
the Jew, who has'nothing in common
with th ; country, forever selfish to
his own interest .and ' has practiced
klanishness for two thousand years,
the immigrant or alien who seks this
country as a lost paradise because-his
own offered him nothing short of
slavery, and the hundreds upon thou
sands of individuals who have an ab
solute disregard for the laws.
So those who believe in an open
town where they shall sell whisky,
permit the pool and dance halls to
stay open on Sunday and whose petty
politicians allow their officers to wink
at the law, then we say they must
shoulder this responsibility of law en
forcement or get out.
To those who read my message I
tell you that Alabama’s membership
is growing by leaps and bounds, so it
is throughout the country, but if we
receive five talents we must work and
double the amount, we should not
bury out one talen like the brother
who received one even though we have
to account for the one that we receive.
Keep forever pushing forward, do
not permit yourself to be discouraged
by the poisonous utterances of some
scalawag, for the day of victory is n'ot
far off.
FOREI6N IMMIGRATION
(By Montgomery County Correspond
ent.)
Almost every nation in the world
is eagerly waiting to see what meas
ures the United States will take upon
her serious immigration problem.
Many American citizens do not
know that just a few years ago mil
lions of their taxes were paid to a
committee to • decide the question.
Why-not make a definite decision this
time?
European nations all have large
war debts, thus causing hordes to
come to this country to dodge the
high taxes.
Reasoning will prove to anyone
that a class which, was or is unpa
triotic to its native country, cannot
possibly be patriotic to any other.
It is for more than a mere fact,
that the class of immigrants now and
who have been coming to this coun
try, are constantly lowering the
morals and standards of living of the
American people.
Careful examination of statistics
will prove that most of the trouble
in the United States originates from
the foreign element which is always
opposed to law and order.
Aliens in most cases have proved
to be “migratory,” that is, they come
here and obtain enough money to go
back home and live in luxury."
Furthermore, this low class of
aliens have always worked for a low
er wage than an American could live
on; therefore, the alien got the job.
Is it fair that a few big manufac
turers be permitted to import these
illiterate hordes for their own bene
fit without regarding the prosperity
of the'nation?
' Regulations must be made to stop
the foreign immigration, at least un
til we naturalize those wlio are al
ready on our hands and causing so
much trouble.
Since naturalizing has a far great
er meaning than just simply taking
the papera, we must not forget that
a native-born American must live
here twenty-one years before he can
legally vote, while the alien with the
papers has to live here only five years
to vote.
The native-born AMERICANS are
striving to put AMERICA FIRST.
Therefore, they are in favor of dos
ing our doors to foreigners belonging
to the low and undesirable class, thus
leaving them open to -the better de
sirable class, who are worthy of be
coming American citizens.
“What the Church has done, what
she has expressly or tadtly approved
in the past that is exactly what she
will do, expressly or tadtly approve
in the future, if the same circum
stances occur.”—Bronson’s Review,
January, 1854.
It is the nature of a great mind to
be calm and uridietrubed and ever to
despise injuries and misfortune.

HE WISDOM of a FOOL
Writer Declares Preachers Should Come Down From High
Horses-Are Afraid of Congregation-Too Many
Churches “Gone To Seed."
- BY SANBALLAT •
This is going to be addressed to the
Protestant Christian preachers of the
United States.'
For a long time 1 have been lead
ing up to the time when I could give
you a severe lecture.
You need a lecture. In fact you
need a series of lectures, and unless
this gets results, you will expect to
hear from me regularly—each week—
like one of those motion picture lie
rials.
Get off your high horse and sit
down. Calm yourself, because I am
going to make you real mad.
I have listened to you talk a long
time. I have attended the services
and have been among the few men
present in your congregations. You
haven’t had so many women, either.
That is, most of you haven’t, and I
know why. I am going you
why. lam going to tell you how that
you may take your old church out of
the “GONE TO SEED” class.
This v- why the average preacher
is standing still and seeing his con
gregations stand still or grow but
slowly. He is afraid of his congre
gation.
Yes, sir, those old preachers are
afraid of their congregations.
Too many toes are seen by them,
as they stand up in the pulpit. They
don’t want to step on toes.
The result is you are preaching
sermons that have the sound of THE
OSOPHY, and that are as barren of
religion as a frog is of feathers.
You are toadying to the “ISMS.”
There is everything in your sermon
but the Gospel.
You are letting the modem schools
of unbaked thought control your
thinking—or so-called thinking.
To be frank you are trying tp carry
water on both shoulders at once. In
atead of forcing issues, or leading
the parade with good issues, you wait
with your ear to the ground until you
hear which side is going to be popu
lar, and then you hop onto that side.
Think of it. Preachers doing that!
Yes, preachers doing that. God bless
you, not all of them, but a lot.
You are thinking what kind of an
impression you are making on the
whatever that outfit is that has
charge of the finances of your church.
Mustn’t hurt any of them, or they
might decide to aSfe"the congregation
to side with them and ask for your
resignation.
Affects All Denominations
That sort of thing is affecting
preachers of every denomination, un
til the church services are getting to
be so dead that to attend them seems
to be like a “hark to the tomb.”
Your night services are failing to at
tract any, but a few, and the prayer
meeting service, the spiritual dynamo
of the church, is run down to a very
few. Those who are failing to come
to church when the weather is warm;
when the weather is cool, when the
weather is wet, or the weather is dry.
Any old excuse counts for staying
away from church, and instead of
the saying that “hell is paved with
good intentions,” it should read, “hell
is paved with poor excuses.” It af
fects all denominations. Curiously,
however, my latest experience has
been with three successive preachers
of one denomination, and that of a
church that prides and preens itself
on its great care for/the education of
those who would enter the ministry.
As all of your Protestant churches
are more or less boasting of their
schools and colleges, I will not men
tion the church name but let you
ponder. Ask yourself—the question
—-“It is I?” “Is it my denomina
tion?”
Being very much interested in that
part of the instruction of Jesus to
His disciples when He told them to
go to John in prison and tell him,
“THE POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL
PREACHED TO THEM,” I naturally
have interested myself in a great
many things that have for their ob
ject the preaching of the gospel—
not to the righteous but sinners.
Those poor, and those sinners, the
outcasts' of society, in jails and
prison houses—have a great deal of
my thought, attention, money and
prayers* I have seen marvelous
.things come from the preaching of
the gospel to the prisoners. Desir
ous of quickening a dead conscience
on the part of the people, with re
gard to this particular work, as a
layman, with another party, interest
ed in the same work, I visited ona
of the'leading preachers of a certain
denomination in a certain large city.
The idea was to secure his church for
a great rally of 'Christian people to
hear an internationally famous man
on the subject of the unprivileged in
the jails_and the penitentiaries. .That
church had been given over to nearly'
every sort of pink tea party that
could be imagined.
Limousines and Tailored Garments
’ As I walked toward the church,
standing in front I saw an automo
bile. A Ford? No. I said an auto
mobile. It was a beautiful shiny
thing, and seemed to have just coma
from under the ministrations of a
dozen lackeys—in gum boots and
rough clothing, who hustled around
to get it ready for REV. Mr. Hoity
Toity, thj grand and mighty preach
er of the tabernacle. I recalled
having heard that preacher speak to
a club meeting. I recalled his im
maculate dress, and the precision with
which his hair had been combed and
dressed. I recalled the crease in his
trousers. My heart sank as I thought
of going into his comfortable office,
and asking that round faced, cheerful
individual to DO SOMETHING' ON
BEHALF OF THE POOR DOWN
TRODDEN SINNERS WHO NEED
ED THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO
THEM. But my friend and I went in
and made our mission known. Did I
say known? I take it back. We tried
to make our mission known. I can see
the poor fellow, whom I accompanied.
I recall that many a time he has gone
hungry at luncheon hour each day for
an entire week, in order to save the
money that he had for lunch to get
some comfort for some poor sinneT
in jail—to take to him or her on
Sunday. I recalled that on more than
one that man had denied
himself and family necessities, in or
der that he might work out some
plan to keep a poor discharged or pa
roled prisoner from going hungry,
and in trying to obtain him a job,,
where he could mak good. I have
heard that poor fellow as on his
knees he pleaded with God to make
him unselfish in his work for the
needy and poor outcasts of society.
As he «tood there in contrast with
that fine preacher of the Temple—l
felt a pity, for I almost sensed what
the answer would be. It came short,
and snappy, for these popular preach
ers must be short and snappy, in or
der that they will have plenty of time
to get a close shave, and have their
nails manicured and their boots
blacked, before the next pink tea af
fair comes off. It was snapped out—
“YOU CAN’T GET MY CHURCH.”
Then I thought of the great spirit for
whom the meeting was to be ar
ranged, and the great work for which
he was to plead. BUT I DID NOT
THINK THOSE THINGS UNTIL I
WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT THE
TEMPLE ATMOSPHERE, because
as curtly—as briefly, and as aptly as
he had turned down an opportunity
to help in the great work of making
it possible to carry out the dictum of
the Master—to preach the Gospel to
every creature, I replied—“THAT IS
all we Want to know, come
ON BROTHER .” “GOOD
MORNING, MR. HOITY TOITY.”
ANOTHER OF THE SAME DE
NOMINATION
There is another great church in
in the same city, and it has about
equal influence with the first. They
were of the same denomination. We
went there. The preacher was not
in. It was nearly twelve o’clock, and
he had hardly had time to get to the
church. “Perhaps he would be down
in the afternoon.” Many of his large
corps of assistants were on the job.
My, they were running hitherand
all kinds of plans. One of
them—ALMOST gave us sympathetic
hearing. We finally used the phone
and called the preacher at his home.
“No—our engagements were well
ahead”—and every hour of his church
was taken up. There was no' hint
that we might have the church at an
hour when there were no regular
services going on, but there were the
usual—“l am sorry,” etc.
STILL ANOTHER
In the great church in which I was
raised—l had still another experience
to go through before I could switch
to another denomination and childe
its lack of sympathy with the ONE
GREATEST OF ALL CAUSES.
Being a member of a certain organ
ization of men, which has clubs in
nearly every city of the land, I have
had reason to meet a man, a great
preacher, or one so-called—who is of
that, same denomination. I have heard
him talk at national gatherings, and
I have asked myself “WHAT IS THE
FAILING OF THAT MAN?” His
speeches always appeared to me to be
directed toward the reconciliation of
all sorts of unreconciliable elements.
In short, they just breathed hypoc
risy in every line.
In that club are men of all faiths.
The Catholics know that when that
man is introduced as a presbyterian
—that he is a Protestant. Let him—
or whosoever would do so, for him,
place his head ostrich-like in the sand,
pretend that the Catholics do not
know that. Presbyterianism is Pro
testant, they cannot get those Cath
olics to feel anyhing but that a erase
hypocritical trick is being played
upon them. The Jews, when he is
announced, know that if that man is
true to the pretentions of his
church, that he has token obligation
o£ fealty and loyalty of the highest
type, to defend type, to defend the
Christian religion. I had wondered
if others had felt about that man as
I had. I wondered if iny feelings were
not unjust. One day there came to
me an opportunity 4o have my opin
ion of him verified. It was a peculiar
verification. Understand that the or
ganization is not religious, but that
Jews Catholics and Protestants are
members. Each know exactly what
the other stands for. This man was
called upon to offer the opening
prayer of a convention. He prayed
—and he prayed all around and
about—and finally when he finished,
a man belonging to his own denomi
nation, and who worships at the
Temple, first mentioned in this ar
ticle, said. “DID YOU EVER SEE A
MAN WHO COULD MEET THE OC
CASION LIKE REV. can?
HE NEVER STEPS "ON THE
CORNS OF ANYBODY.” Then I
thought that I would never pray a
prayer, voluntarily composed, for
such an occasion—lF I HAD TO BE
A TRIMMER OF MY CONVIC
TIONS. I became firmly convinced
that the Rev. Mr. DON'T STEP ON
THEIR CORNS, was just the sort of
preacher I had sized him up to be.
He, to me, is a man afraid of his con
gregation; afraid of his crowd. He
has not sincere convictions, or he
would be so engrossed in the sincerity
of his prayers that he would ask his
GOD with all of the depths of his
inner soul, to give both Jew and Ca
tholic light.
THE KU KLUX KLAN
The Ku Klux Klan, regardless of
what the Protestant Christian
preachers think of it, or regardless of
what other people think of it, has
come into the world for a great mis
sion. It has come into the world for
a great mission. It has declared it
self as standing squarely behind the
Word of God, and firm in the belief
that the world in sin needs a Savior,
and that its members are trusting in
the saving power of Jesus—for life
eternal. It ahs called on its men
to get back to the church, and sup
port its every service by their pres
ence on Sunday, prayer nights, and
to help to make the Sunday schools
most effective in the teachings of the
Word of God from His Book, the
Bible. Scores of Klan papers are ad
monishing the people to get back in
to the harness and work for the liv
ing God. The Klan will push that
movement, and propaganda that
movement, and do a world of publica
tion for that movement until you will
shortly ®ee great droves of the men
and women who have been somewhat
neglectful, getting into the great van
of people that are moving toward the
church.
If you will read the 12th chapter of
Romans, you will find the Scripture
on which the Klan founds its prin
ciples. “Brethren—by the mercies of
God present your bodies a living sac
rifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service.”
They can’t do that unless they get
back to the Word of God, and to the
Church of the Living God. They are
coming. They will come in droves and
hosts. Are you going to be prepared
to receive them ?
SHOOT STRAIGHT PREACHERS
There is no reason why any pro
testant preacher cannot begin to pre
pare for that day. Get rid of that
hypocritical idea that you are here
to please everybody. In trying to do
it, you please none. Get down on
your knees and ask God to forgive
you for your cross-eyed attitude.
Ask him to make a real preacher out
of you, and permit you to dispense
the Gospel. Don’t wait for the crowds
to be driven in by the Klan heardsmen
but begin to preach with that power
that God can give you i£ you will let
Him, and that will attract them to
your church. Then you may be able
to claim more of the credit for get
ting people to back up their profes
sion of religion by going to church
and studying the Bible. Shoot
straight—throw sinners the life pre
servers make your preaching count in
winning souls, and may God bless you
if THE WISDOM OF A FOOL, HAS
HELPED.
