LIVER PILLS
)iOR TlE CURE OF
Hepatitis, or Liver Complaint,
I IPI'N.PIA AND SICK HEADACH(.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
DAIN in the right side, under the c
1 cdge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and 1
it frequently extends to the top of the Fa
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stomn- - -
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness: the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain, U
accomp iied with a dull, heavy sen
satmon in the ba k part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss ot memory,
aIi.cmp.uIied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done. A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient comnplains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low ; and although
he is satished that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
I)R. C. McLAN.E'S LIVER PILLS, IN
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, when W
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are atilicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.
aEWAsE Or IMIT'AUAesmNI.
'The genuine are never sugar coated.
Every box has a red wax seal on the
lid, with the impression Di. McLAns's
LIVER PILLS.

he saw itas it in mockery of the an
colorless marble of her likeness, a au
deep tinge of vermillion sffused her at

An exclamation of wonder esaoped sp
the lips of lornox. A visible tremor we
passed over his well knit frame.
The velvet drapery dropped from ln
the hands of the artist. It i
"The God enamored DANAE could din

The Sculptor smiled. sh
He signalled the slave to withdraw tb
hastily. Both men immedlately re- on

Upon reachoing the massive Iron la1
