Short and Advancing.
Kansas City, July 1:1. - No rain has as
yet fallen in any part of the douth
srri koni districr, r isii t iing of all of
Kansas, western Missoura, Oklahoma
and Indian Territoru-i. )v r uiich of
this region Fruiay was the wi rst day of
the l ng hot spell, the temlnerature being
over 1100 with no breeze.
Corn, oats, hay and Ixmtao'ks are so
badly injured that even with rain th
yield would he short and as the weath
er bureau gives no hi Ie of relief the
outlook is discouraging. At some places
in Kansas there has tween no rainfall
whatever for nearly three months.
The present is the worst drouth since
18ll), when Now England sent food to
the settlers of Kansas. However. the.
past years have been very prosperous
ones and even now the Kansas farmers
are harvesting one of the largest crops
of wheat, if not the largest, in the his
tory of the state. A great many ooun
ties send word that with rain oorn will
be a half crop, without rain soon, no
yield. A few say there is yot no hope
for a a fair harvest.
Hay is worth $20 a ton,a cent a pound
the highest price ever reached in this
market. This is almost as much per
pound as wheat is worth. Receipts are
small and the hay which came in was.
sold some time ago in the country before
the drouth became so serious.
BECOMING ALARMING.
Drough Is Kansas and Missouri Out Dows
Production of Crops.
Chicago, July 13.-Advices are that
the heat and drolAht in the southwest
is unbroken. It is said the damage out
side of Kansas and Missouri is compara
tively slight, but unless relief oomes
within the next 10 days the oorn erop
situation will approach a calamity.
A message from Topeka, Kas., says
prospects are for a crop of but 50,000,000
bushels of corn, although last years'
crop was 11(3,000,000 and that of previ
ous year 277,000,000 bushels. The loss of
hay and potatoes also is great, sainmd
only to the loss of corn. It is esumnated!
the farmers of Kansas and Missouri
have already lost 5'),1000,000 by the tor
ridity and drought.
The straits in which the corn crop to
said to be situate4 is reflected in this
course of prices of that cereial on thi
boarel of trade. September corn is quot
ed up to 12 ,r cents or 9 coits higher
than the price one month ago Se0
teuiber oats sell at 3:1i cuts or 7 cents.
