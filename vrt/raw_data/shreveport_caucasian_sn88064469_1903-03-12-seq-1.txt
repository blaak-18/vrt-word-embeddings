THE GROUND HOG.
CONNECTION OF THIS ANi\iAL
WITH THE W\EATHIER.
A Talk by an Authority on the Subject.
Questioned About Planting Po
tatoes and the Reply.
It is said that "truth is stranger than
fiction." and in this relation may be
connected the ground hog and the
weather. From an authority: on the sub
ject which can not be questioned it is
said that on the morning of the second
day of February of this year the ground
hog crawled from his hole, and after
taking a survey of the surroundings,
which were not to his notion, he blink
ed left eye, gave a grunt of disapproval,
crawled into his hole and pulled the hole
after him, and that forty days thereafter
he will crawl out of his hole and stay
over ground. dry or wet, cold or hot,
regardless of all conditi ins. This ex
pounder on the ground hog asserts that
his forecast of the weather is infalli
ble and he ivould put the hog's prog
nostications against he best barometer
and weather forecasters on the face of
the globe. "On February 2," continued
this authority, "and bear in mind it was
on a Monday the ground hog who is not
as big as an elephant, on getting over
ground frisked his little tail and saw
his shadow on the ground. That was
enough and he immediately crawled
back and there he will stick until Sat
urday, March 14, when the forty days
of his crawling will have ended and he
then crawls out in safety. The' ground
hog is a peculiar animal, but he knows
a sight about the weather. He no doubt
knew there was to have been a lot of
rain and, he did not propose to stay out
of ground and run the risk of being
drowned. Now, if on the day he crawl
ed out, the indications would have been
cold and freezing he would have crawl
ed back as quick, as it is not to his lik
ing to stand cold weather and exposure
and be frizzled up. If when he crawled
out the indications would have been fair
and pleasant he would have stayed out
and instead of rain VI oiuld have had
fine weather, but the ground hog's al
right. AhfterSatzuraM-arch'i 14, you
tc bfor t i7gisof.ii' gtoa g
Am4'.~v a9m~se is-nrt, - if T a hie
hot told the trutht From March 14 the
weather will be favorable, and if the
season for farming and plantting is late
there is plenty of time for big harvests
of corn .and cotton. There is a striking
feature of the ground hog. I watched
him when he had -crawled out of the
ground. He was fat and slick, which is
a sign of prosperity for the year, an
abundance of. good things for us all,"
and having delivered himself on the
ground hog( in a fashion interesting to
his listeners and delightful to himself,
a skeptic in the crowd qty _ried of a
friend: "Say, Joe, when do you plant
potatoes-in the dark or the light of the
moon?" "In the ground, sir," was the
quick' rejoinder. With this abrupt end
ing, the crowd dispersed, leaving the
ground hog man to his own meditation.
But jest as you may or will, the
ground hog is all right and don't you
forget - it.

BLANCHARD RALLY
A LARGE NUMBER OF CITIZENS
MET AT COURT HOUSE.
A Hearty Greeting by Democrats and
Friends-The Personnel of the
Executive Committee.
As anticipated there was gathered in
the court house Tuesday night a large
nmmber of citizens of Shreveport.
among whom were a number of the
friends of Mr. Blanchard who responded
to personal invitations. It was a Blan
chard meeting organized in the political
interests of Mr. Blanchard and as an
nounced was suggested and intended to
repudiate the slanders of a few persons
that he could not carry his own parish.
This gathering was called to order by
Colonel W. H. Wise, who asked that
secretaries beappointed. and on motion
of Judge Pugh this "old chestnut" was
again thlust upon the representatives of
the pres. by whom it was accepted with
meekne` anl resignation. There was
then rea a list of vice presidents, resi
dents of the city and country, compris
ing over a hundred, and of the gentle
men fr the country wards in attend
ance thite were noted: "Messrs. W. E.
Wasson' Noah Tyson, W. O. Owens,
B. F. Ricliff, B. F. Teat, D. G. Moore,
William Adams, Lee Johnson, John W.
Keel, Rites Browning, L A. Alexander,
R H. Harrell, J. W. Wood and C. C.
Alexander." In the gathering were a
nmmber of the personal friends of Mr.
Blanchard from Bossier and Red River,
and one of thi features was the reading
by Judge Pugh of telegrams from gen
tlemen residents of various sections of
the tSater egessing their best wishes
and giviS th#e assurance of their loyal
support. he e;zing, of each telegram
was greet~c with cheers.
The spielfcs were by Colonel W. H.
Wise. M;.E ke Bernstein, Mr. John
Monkot ., of Jewella, Dr. C. H.
Irion of sier, Mr. Ben Wolfson of
Red Rive* Mr. C. ;. Cory, Mr. Charles
L Gt.we, Captain H. P. Wells, Mr.
W. A- Af~r Mr. Blanchard had
'd . ~hwowhich the closest
. ~·gI - and throughout
w he w . frianttifapplauded, Cot
onel John S. Young proposed three
cheers and a: tiger for the next governor
of "Louisiana, Judge N. C. Blanchard,
which was responded to with enthusi
asm. -
The following is a copy. of two reso
lutions submitted by Mr. Mike Bern
stein and adopted unanimously:
"Resolved, That the report that is be
ing so persistently circulated throughout
the State by a few persons here that
Justice N. C. Blanchard could not carry
Caddo parish in the approaching State
Democratic Convention is untrue and
utterly unfounded.
"Resolved .further, That at the proper
time the Defiocrats of Caddo parish will
present his name as their choice for the
exalted office of governor of this, his
native State, with every confidence that
he will have a united delegation in his
support, and to that end we pledge the
ever faithful Democracy of Caddo par
ish."
The following named gentleinen con
stitute the Blanchard executive commit
tee: W. H. Wise, chairman; Ike Bar
ran, John S. Young, Samuel Speaks, J.
M. Martin, A. Currie, A. S. Toombs, J.
W. Atins, George H. Russell, N. Gold
stein, John A. Sewall, J. B. Ardis, F. A.
Tusten, Michel Bernstein, W. A. Mabry,
E. J. Conger. Leon I. Kahn. E. E. H;.r
key. \\ill L. Young. \\. A. Nelson, Her
man Strube, Thomas B. Chase, T. C.
Barret, J. C. Pugh. S. Q. Hollingswvc-th,
L. E. Stokes, J. M. Tucker.
And with this meeting there has been
actively inaugurated a political cam
paign nearly thirteen months preceding
the election in 1904. and at least nine
months of the nomination whether by
primary election or State convention.
Why this haste?
The gathering was a success, as it
should have been, and in the home city
of Mr. Blanchard, where there are over
2-5,oo000 inhabitants: a meeting less pro
nounced would have been recorded a
discredit to him. From that view then
Mr. Blanchard's friends should be well
satisfied and the endorsing resolution
must be no less gratifying to him, but
there is one feature of this meeting
which will address itself forcefully to
the men who, unmoved by sentiment
and personality, think and reason logi
cally, the Democrats throughout the
State who are more concerned in the re
form of abuses in the party, and who
favor measures and policies for the wel
fare of Democracy as being paramount
to the success of individuals will reach
the conclusion that if "a few persons"
have already created such an influence
that Justice Blanchard could not carry
Caddo parish and that to offset or neu
tralize this influence the Blanchard rally
was a logical sequence, what will be the
power of these "few persons" when or
ganized systematically for the purpose
as sustaining the allegation that Mr.
Blanchard could not carry his own par
ish? From the Caucasian's Democratic
point of view that resolution should not
have been submitted nor adopted, as
it indicates a weakness maintained in a
boastful sense, in the absence of an issue
which is not before the people. The en
dorsement of Mr. Blanchard was the
proper thing to do, and with that en
dorsement he and his friends could have
adjourned the meeting. But the best and
greatest of men will make mistakes.
A PATRIOTIC APPEAL
For Funds for the Home for Needy
Confederate Women.
(To the Caucasian.)
-Rim Intnd; ,Va.; - 'P m
Friends: The managers of the Home
for Needy Confederate Women will
hold a fair at the M tsonic Temple,
Richmond, Va., for the benefit of the
Home, beginning March the I6th and
lasting ten days. The women who bore
the burden in the dark days of the Con
federacy are now, by reason of increas
ing years, unable to care for themselves.
Their natural protectors laid down their
lives for the "Lost Cause" and have left
the care of their loved ones as a sacred
legacy to us who have succeeded them.
The Home is our effort to meet the
cry of need which has come to us from
many survivors of those times that tried
men's souls. It was opened October S5,
190oo, since which, time it has cared for
seventeen needy Confederate women.
But many applications have had to be
rejected for lack of accommodations.
We need more room. The State of
Virginia has given five thousand dol
lars, and this fair is an effort to increase
that amount as much as possible, in
order to have a sufficient sum for the
erection of a new building, better suited
to the needs of the Home.
Mrs. A. J. Montgue, the wife of our
esteemed governor, is president of this
committee, and joins us in an appeal to
you for a contribution to this fund.
