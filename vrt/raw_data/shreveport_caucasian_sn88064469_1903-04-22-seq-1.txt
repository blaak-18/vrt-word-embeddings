THE GRAND JURY,
CONVENED IN SPECIAL SESSION
BY JUDGE LAND.
Instructions by the Court-Report ol
the Inquiry-The Matthews Case
Still Shrouded in Mystery.
The grand jury, called into special
sesssion by His Honor, A. D. Land,
judge of the First Judicial District
Court, on the recommendation of the
coroner's jury, who "urged a further
examination by the grand jury" of the
Matthews murder, convened at ia
o'clock Monday, April 2o.
In his charge to the grand jury, af
ter dwelling on the shocking tragedy,
the judge directed the grand jury to
"consider what connection, if any, the
man Washington, who was killed on
April it, had with the murder of Mrs.
Matthews. If you find," he said. "that
he had no connection with said crime,
then you will proceed with your inves
tigation to the end that the real criminal
may be discovered.
"When a murder has been commit
ted," said Judge Land, "any officer or
individual may arrest, without a war
rant, any suspected person on 'reason
able cause of suspicion.' It is the duty of
an officer, in all cases of felony, to act
upon credible information or on indica
tions of guilt, known to him, and arrest
the suspected person at once. It has been
well said that 'it would block the wheels
-f j ustice' if am-rofficer, could not do his
duty without being answerable, criminal
ly and civilly, in the event the evidence
should not sustain the suspicion.
"It is always one's duty to submit to
a lawful arrest, and forcible resistance
s a crime.
"The law is well settled that an officer
may use all necessary force to overcome
resistance to an arrest or to prevent the
escape pf the party arrested. I have no
reasons to believe that the officers in
killing the man referred to went beyond
the strict line of their duty, even should
you find that the party arrested was in
fact innocent of the crime. Whether
Fiere was 'rgasonable cause for: suspi
- g0 ediat the eseape of tht par1tr
arrested is a matter for your consideria
Lion."
Having received the instructions of
the court, the grand jury retired to their
room, where they heard the statements
,f several persons, including members
"f Mrs. Matthews' family. It was about
5:3o o'clock in the afternoon when the
grand jury submitted their report, read
ing-as follows:
To the Hon. A. D. Land, Judge of the
First Judicial District Court: The grand
jurors convened in special session under
the order of the court beg leave to sub
mit the following report:
We have investigated the Matthews
murder case as far as the testimony be
fore us will permit us to go, and at pres
ent have no finding to present to the
court.
The mystery surrounding this case
shows the necessity of blood hounds in
ferreting out crime, and we recommend
that the police jury and city council of
Shreveport offer a reward of $500, $25o
each, for the arrest and conviction of
the party or parties guilty of the mur
der of Mrs. Alice Matthews, in the city
of Shreveport on the morning of April
II, Io93.
Having completed the labors before
us, we beg leave to adjourn, subject to
the order of the court.
F. D. HUDNALL,
- Foreman of Grand Jury.
The grand jury's session was accord
ingly adjourned subject to call.
INVESTIGATION UNSATISFAC
TORY.
If there are citizens in this community
who expected the grand jury to unravel
this murder mystery. we must admit
candidly that we are one of the excep
tion. The grand jury was in session less
than five hours, when it was expected
their sitting would occupy at least one
day. The atrocity and the perplexity of
this crime precluded haste. It was such
an inquiry as required careful, persist
ent search. The speed of the grand jury
is in marked contrast to the coroner's
jury,: which exhausted every means at
their command to develop a clue. the
grand jury had before- them, through
persons summoned, about the same in
ormation' which is familiar to the pub
c,- and there were persons who should
have beenDheard who were not called or
smirtned to appear. Indeed it may be
mid that what was.developed is in part
,in erping with the clear theories ad"
auc by the Caucasiansdi one may
~ botw;:..th
.-ts
leged, impressed some members of the
grand jury and it is the story of the ne
gro woman who overheard two men
talking near her window, discussing the
murder, on the night of the crime, dur
ing which one of the men answering to
a query said he "had struck hard enough
to kill." This story has been exploited
and is one of the many suggested in
minds distorted by unpleasant dreams.
THE CONCLUSION OF THE JURY.
As will be noted, the grand jury has
announced that "we have investigated
the Matthews murder case as far as the
testimony-before us will permit us to go,
and at present have no finding to report
to the court." In this respect the grand
jury's conclusion is as the coroner's
jury, with the exception that the cor
oner's jury was more persistent in their
search for clues. It was one of the cor
oner's jury who located Ed Porter,.who
was reported to have been shot and
killed as the murder er, and who is in
the active flesh today.
Having failed to 4fvelop the case, it
is possible that this rady will go on
the record. of great -erimes which are
unsolved, and perhapitthe perpetrator of
this diabolical deed spay shield himself
from the clutches of fustice and the law
until he shall have-Jone beyond the
grave. In this case tere are peculiari
ties which, when a~'zed deliberately,
are startling, but, ri~on as one may,
the motive as the finl~s perplexing. But
as we said at the ib jinning, the grand
jurors acting on the jformation before
them, had no clue andgroped under dif
ficulties perhaps beyiqt their control.
THE GRAND JURY ON BLOOD
HOUtmflS
In their report to J, court the grand
jury suggest the itcessity of blood
hounds, which, in sope cases, would
prove of great value ia=iuting a fleeing I
criminal, but blood hot~nds could not ac
complish the imposae. The blood
hounds may be ever g and sa
gacious in training a~t.give the most
gratifying results in- more or less
open and clear, wh i~ ou the scent
they could follow to Ahe end
and capture, but the ~oit d hbe
of little value in
whose tracks hav
scores of people,
hounds shod.I be c an r na: con-
servatie sense. The irst act on. the part
of the legal authorities when a murder
has been committed. should be to hasten
to the scene, assume charge of the prem
ises, permit no one to go in or out, and
ot secure then and there all the informa
tion which may be obtained readily, but,
if there is no restraint and everybody'be
,.ermitted to go in and out, how can the
best dogs find, take and keep"the trail?
THE DISTINCT AND FORCEFUL
WORDS OF THE JUDGE.
In his charge to the grand jury Judge
Land said: "It is always one's duty to
submit to a lawful arrest, and and forci
ble resistance is a crime."
Truer .or more forceful words could
not have been uttered, but we do not
think their interpretation to mean that
because a man, arrested or about to be
arrested, should try to flee and to escape
should be killed outright; If carried into
execution literally, almost any man
would be at the mercy of .an officer who,
if not conservative, moderate and pru
dent in his action could shoot and kill,
on the pretext of "attempting to escape."
It will be conceded that when a person
is suspected of guilt and is trying to
escape, that the officer pof the law should
"get his man," but in=-this enlightened
century when we are boastful of our civ
ilization, we auld not -costrue and in
terpret this declaration to mean that the
man seeking-to escape sh be killed,
when he may be crippled and taken
alive. After all, it is -a qestion which
must be left to the representative of the
law who, if he be discreet and if he be
not always ready with his handy pistol,
will not shoot to kill except in an emer
gency or in definse of his life, when in
periL We are led to these reuections on
the belief that an i p ·has been
created in justification of the killing of
any man resisting arre or fseeing from
an officer, when that man ould be shot
in the legs or feet or oth iSse crippled
and taken and not kile It is a well
known fact, substantially eseblished by
repeated demonstrations, that some- men,
especially a-groes, will -runirt an of
ficer, thou~[tless of his perl ika.eing,
which- he ca- not mi trl u therefore
to not kill a man rastin r an of
icer and wanted ter a iia afair, but
to cripple hit if-aecessary mast suggest
itself as hntanm : in the ese rise of an
oA&fial fc:io -
sion thereto. Doubtless through inadver
ance, but as was said in the Caucasian
at the time of the unfortunate homicide,
the officers were justifiable in law, under
the circumstances, as they then had
every reason to believe that the fleeing
man was the murderer striving to es
cape.
REWARD SUGGESTED.
The grand jury has recommended that
the police jury and the city council offer
a reward each of $25o-total $5oo-for
the apprehension and conviction of the
criminal. The State should also add a
liberal reward to stimulate in this re
sult, but perhaps rewards regardless of
amount may never lead to the unravel
ing of this crime, which, like others, are
mysteries still.
SINGULAR CASES.
Without mentioning names it may be
recalled that not many years ago there
lived in this city a family in whom there
were two grown daughters. The family
moved to Texas. One night in summer a
white man was seen in the room occu
pied by these two sisters who slept in
the same bed. In the room was a lamp
burning brightly. One of the sisters on
seeing the man grappled with him while
her sister ran into the room adjoining,
in which was sleeping their mother, who
had been aroused by the screams and
the turmoil. Almost in a twinkle after
the sister had reached her mother, who
clasped her in her arms, there was heard
the report of a pistol shot and this young
woman was dead. The man fled and
evaded arrest, there being seemingly no
clue, and although the sister spared had
beld this man and struggled with him
face to face ,no information, not a clue,
was ever obtained to this criminal. And
there are crimes so peculiar that it would
seem senseless to attempt to unravel
them, as for instance the famous Still
well case in Missouri which some years
igo agitated the whole continent, and
recently the Burdick and Pennell mys
teries which have defied solution by the
best detective talent.
The Stillwell case was remarkable for
its peculiarities, which were distinctive.
le was wealthy. He was murdered with
n" to hours after he and his wife had
.home at idaiht firomn a social
i ife _ was by the amr
ýborribkdeed. Every effort to arrest the
murderer was futile. When Mrs. Still
well married a Dr. - (name can not
be recalled) within a year from the date
,f the crimc, the agitation was renewed
with vigor, and the couple having re
moved to San Francisco, led the Chron
icle of that city to- an. investigation
which cost thousands of dollars. The
couple were arrested and returned to
Missouri, and after lingering in jail
about a year, secured a change of venue
from their county and were acquitted by
1 jury.
Other cases as peculiar, almost paral
'els of the Matthews case, could be cited
where the ax was the weapon, used pur
posely to mislead and divert suspicion,
md in these cases there has been little
iccomplished, but yet "murder will out"
tnd some day what is now perplexing
and enshrouded in gloom may be made
,lain.

bond in lieu of the to per cent reserve
held by the city to cover the maintenance
sof alleys paved by -R. N. McKellar as
per contract of date June 18, igos. The
amount of said bond is $3o0oo and the
contract between city' and McKellar
provided that such a maintenance bond
could be substituted in lieu of said
maintenance reserve upon the applica
tion of McKellar. Said application was
made by IR N. McKellar and we deemed
it advisable to accept the bond as the
maiptenance fund now in reserve
amounted to about $270o, whereas the
bond offered to $3ooo and such action
on your part would result in bringing to
