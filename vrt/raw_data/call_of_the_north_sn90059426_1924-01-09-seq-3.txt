A PROUST,
(From “Northwestern Christian Ad

A Fair Analogy
Those ministers who are either
members of or sympathizers with
the shrouded, masked, invisible and
intangible order of K. K. K. (and
the number is inexplicably large) we
desire to ask: How would they feel
and what would they do were they
to discover a similar organization
within and confined to their local
church membership—a company of
men banded in secret to pass judg
ment upon the remaining members
of the church, including the pastor
himself, and to execute their judg
ment by whatever means they deter
mine? For instance, suppose some
Sunday morning a family in good
standing, on coming into their pew,
were to find a note within the leaves
of their hymn book informing them
that their actions before and after
service were unbecoming of Metho
dists, and that unless they mended
their ways they would be summarily
dealt with.
COLO.
Then, on the next Sunday morn
in, as the pastor began to adjust his
pulpit papers, he should find a note
from the same self-constituted sec
ret organization informing him that
his pulpit utterances had been the
subject of consideration and it was
agreed he should stop preaching on
a certain theme, or take the conse
quences; or that he had better cease
calling upon a certain family if he
knew what was good for him, each
note signed by the mysterious letters
of the organization. Pray, what
would a pastor do when member
after member had come to him ex
hibiting such strange and myster
ious warnings? We fancy we know
exactly what he would do. He would
call the official board together, lay
the situation before them, and en
deavor to secure their cooperation
in correcting or eliminating the hid
den order, or failing in that he would
resign.
How long would a church exist
with such a self-constituted group?
Three months would be a liberal
time to allow. A church thus divid
ed against itself and in such fashion
simply could not stand. It would
fall apart and disintegrate, and the
place that knows it now would know
it no more. There is really no need
of pursuing the analogy between a
local church membership and an en
tire community. We raise the ques
tion; that is all.
The Protest
Dr. Elbert Robb Zaring,
Editor “Northwestern Christian Ad
vocate,”
Chicago, 111.
Dear Sir:
As a Methodist and a Klansman,
I am saddened at reading your edi
torial, “A Fair Analogy,” in last
week’s issue of the “Northwestern.”
I know that the daily secular press
adopts the methods of misrepresen
tation and abuse, but surely we
Methodists have a right to expect
better journalism in our church pa
pers.
Do you make your charges against
the Ku Klux Klan from the results
of personal investigation? Surely
you do not merely accept the asser
tions of Jewish and Catholic dom
inated daily newspapers as the basis
of your editorial. And, in the event
of your having discovered from
your own carefully directed inquir
ies that the Klan is guilty of out
lawry, have you laid your indisput
able evidence before the Chicago
grand jurs, or presented it to simi
lar bodies in those regions where you
have proved Klan crimes to have been
committed ?
I once belonged to a Methodist
church in which a fight took place
before the chancel rail between two
members of the official board—over
the question of whether a piano
should be installed in the church. One
insisted on having it there, and the
other opposed the use of such an in
strument of the devil. Yet nobody
thought of accusing all Methodists
of being fond of pummeling one an
other at the mourners’ bench. In an
lowa town where I once lived, the
pastor of our Methodist church be
trayed the servant girl in a home
where he was being entertained.
How dreadful it would have been for
all ministers to be accused of being
alike unfaithful to their vows on the
strength of that tragic happening!
It has not been possible for me to
find dependable proof of Klan out
lawry. An Oklahoma man, guilty
of incest with his young daughter,
was whipped by a band of 15 men,
three of whom were Klansmen. There
also were four Masons in the party,
as well a members of the Woodmen
order, the Knights of Pythias and
the Odd Fellows’ lodge, and Method
ists and Baptists. The Klan expelled
its members concerned in the act of
violence, but the other organizations
are yet to act against their represen
tatives in the mob. Old “Cap" Skip
with, down in Louisiana, urged the
sheriff of his parish to raid a place

Cruelties. Guaranteed to be true.

A REPLY AND ANOTHER
From THE PATRIOT (St. Louis)
where moonshining was going on. The
sheriff said there were no stills there,
but Skipwith insisted the law was be
ing violated. “All right,” the officer
said; “go on and make the raid your
self.” The old Civil war veteran did
so, and went “armed to the teeth.”
He captured the illegal stills, too, and
plenty of other evidence. His course
was probably illegal—but how our
own Peter Cartwright would have
joyed in joining him on that raid!
You suggest Klan criminality in
your editorial, “A Fair Analogy,”
but you seem not to have discovered
in your investigation that Klansmen
do worthy things. Please assemble
your proofs of outlawry by that or
ganization, and for every wrong act
you find I will show you 100 cases of
men turned from unbelief to Christ
ian thinking and living through their
Klan association, to indifferent church
members fired with eagerness for ac
tive Christian service as Sunday
school teachers, members of men’s
religious organizations, and in kind
red fine undertakings, to say nothing
of a citizenship made more alert for
good government by the inspiring in
fluence of Klan teachings and pur
poses.
Please present your proofs, Mr.
Editor, and if your time will not suf
fice for the undertakings, you can get
all the aid you want from the yegg
men and holdup artists of the Amer
ican Unity League, which also is op
posed to the Klan, and from the
Knights of Columbus and various
Jewish organizations fighting it tooth
and toenail.
We must not have our Methodist
press seem to be so careless or so
opposed to fact as is the daily news
paper, for the “Northwestern” does
not need to fear the loss of Catholic
subscribers nor Jewish advertisers!

A Reply
Mr. Frederick R. Barkhurst,
St. Louis, Mo.
My dear Mr. Barkhurst:
I have your letter of November 2nd,
in reply to my editorial on “A Fair
Analogy.” Your letter, I am glad to
say, bore little if any, of the vindic
tiveness and harshness that I some
times get in opposition to articles
that I indulge and it is therefore with
more readiness that I make my ans
wer. You intimate, indeed you say,
that I am writing without knowledge.
Just there is the difficulty. The mem
bership of tbe Klan being secret, their
operations behind closed doors, and
masked faces, it is rather difficult to
know just what they are—or are not
doing. There is this remarkable thing
however, that with the coming of the
Ku Klux Klan, the threats, warnings,
and even punishment upon individuals
has been in vogue throughout the
country. Grant that the Klan is not
responsible for all of this irregularity.
You must admit that it furnishes a
mighty fine cloak, behind which those
so disposed can wreak their personal
animosity and charge it against the
Klan.
There is an old verse in the Bible,
much quoted—“lf meat make my
brother to offend, I will eat no meat
while the world stands” —which
means that if my example will lead
others to wrong I will change my
action. It is a pretty good doctrine
to go by. The Klan being secret, and
making in secret, furnishes an op
portunity for other individuals to
offend in grievous fashion. It seems
to me that this is a point to be con
sidered.
The immediate suggestion for my
editorial came after a visit to a
minister down-state, who if not a
member of the Klan, was a sympath
izer, and who voluntarily related to
me two or three instances in his own
community where the Klan had done
that very thing—driving out offen
ders of the law in one way or an
other. or by threats caused them to
reform. This is not the only case
that has come to my attention. If I
sense the situation correctly, the Klan
is not the same in all communities. It
is possible that they are dinging in
their attitude toward the individual.
There is no doubt in the mind of the
American public but that in the past,
the negro of the south was waited
upon from time to time with sugges
tions or warnings from the Klan as
to what to do and how to do it.
Whether they do this to the negro
now, I do not know, of course I have
no evidence; how could I?
There is only one way to solve this
one question and that was given by
Mr. Mellette in the November At
lantic Monthly, when he proposed
PUBLICITY. Are all the things which
the Ku Klux Klan say against the
Roman Catholics true? The Roman
Catholics say they are not. The Ku
Klux Klan say they are. Mr. Mellet
te suggests that there be a represen
tative, organization or committee to
run down every charge made against
the Roman Catholics concerning their
part in politics, their supposed im
moralities and blaze the truth to the
public. I really believe that that
church itself would co-operate in this
matter. If not, then do it alone, for
a people cannot live on mere rumor.
I have failed to write half a dozen
times about the Klan where I have
written onqe. I cannot accept the
n* CALL OP THE NORTH
Klan’s restrictions upon Americanism.
I believe it is possible for a Jew to
be as good an American as myself or
any member of the Ku Klux Klan. I
believe it is possible for a negro to be
a good American, and loyal American.
I believe that these foreign elements
in our country are capable of citizen
ship and nothing should be put in the
way toward bringing them into this
relation. Whatever the professed at
titude of the Klan toward the Negro,
the Roman Catholic and the Jew, (and
that professed attitude is one of love)
he fact remains that all three of these
strike fire over the Klan. Granting
that you have the highest and purest
and most affectionate motives possi
ble, the fact that the approach of the
Klan to the subject does meet fierce
opposition that is so intense as to come
forth in bitter denunciation, indicates
that the approach is not the right one.
I agree with you that there are cer
tain. evils in this country that must
be eliminated, that there are certain
elements that must be repressed, but
I cannot force myself, even to think,
that because a man’s name ends with
the “ski” of a “tz” or because he
talks with a slight brogue, or even
though his skin has a little more of
a coloring than my own, that that dis
qualifies him for membership in the
great fraternity of Americanism;
wherein the Jew or the Negro or the
Roman Catholic or even the Ameri
can, violates the ideals of our Na
tion, they should be punished. I place
Americanism upon the basis of loyal
ty. I think that the great war proved
that-the black man and the Hebrew
and even the Germans within our
borders, could fight as well for the
protection of our country as a native
American.
If the Klan could only throw aside
its mask, if it could come out into the
open and if in addition it could take
this broad view, basing loyalty upon
a man’s spirit, rather than upon the
color of his skin, or the spelling of
his name, it could be a much greater
force. WE MUST ALL AGREE
THAT THE KLAN DOES MUCH
GOOD IN MANY WAYS, but it can
not reach its full ideal or anything
like it until it approaches the subject
of Americanism in a somewhat dif
ferent spirit.
I thank you for your letter, it is
written in a kindly spirit, and I fancy
if all Klansmen were like you there
would be no discussions over the
matter.
With kindest regards, I remain,
E. ROBB ZARING.
Chicago, Dec. 6.
ANOTHER REPLY
Dr. Elbert Robb Zaring,
Editor “Northwestern Christian Ad-
vocate.” Chicago, 111.
Dear Doctor:
“Quench not the spirit”—write
about the Klan whenever you feel like
it, or are asked to do so. But “prove
all things—hold fast that which is
good, ‘you know!’ GET THE TRUTH,
Doctor, and print it instead of idle
rumor or hear-say evidence from un
trustworthy sources. “If meat shall
make my brother to offend, I will eat
no meat”—and bear in mind that to
print and circulate guessed-at matters
for proved truth will mislead the half
of your readers no better informed
than yourself, while the other half—
members of the Ku Klux Klan—will
speedily develop a fine contempt for
our Methodist press as a dependable
factor!

HOW BEER AND LIGHT
WINE LAWS WORK
OOT IN QUEBEC
To learn at first hand how the
light wine and beer law was working
out in Quebec, The Ladies’ Home
Journal sent A. B. MacDonald there
to investigate with an open and un
prejudiced mind. We quote from his
account of what he found:
One of the first persons with whom
I talked in the province of Quebec
was J. D. Hudson, comptroller of the
national breweries, and a leading
spokesman for the brewers of that
province. “The Quebec liquor law is
the greatest temperance law ever en
acted,’’ he said. “We give the peo
ple all the beer they want, and that
has reduced drunkenness to about
nothing. There is no drunkenness to
speak of in Quebec.”
An hour later I was in the office of
A. Geoffrion, who presides over the
recorder’s court in Montreal, and he
gave me statistics showing that in
the last two years there came into
that court 12,048 persons who had
been arrested in Montreal while “ly
ing drunk in a public street or pub
lic place.” I quote exactly from the
statistical report prepared by the
clerk of his court and given to me
by Recorder Geoffrion himself:
Twelve thousand and forty-eight per
sons arrested in two years, not just
maundering drunk, not singing
drunk, not shouting drunk, not fight
ing drunk, not staggering drunk, but
helplessly dead drunk, “lying drunk
in a public street or public place.”
That night of my first day in Mon
treal I sat in one of the three hun
dred and seven liscnced beer saloons
of that city, a large room with 26
tables, at which more than 100 men
were drinking beer.
I ordered a soda pop, and a man
near me said in beery friendliness:
“Don’t be afraid of this beer, old
man; you can’t get drunk on it; it’s
harmless. You can drink a barrel of
it and not get drunk.”
Drunk, Dead Drunk—on Beer
I moved to another table to be rid
of him, and 30 minutes later he had
crumpled down like a wilted plant,
his arms were outflung upon the ta
ble, and his face was in a puddle of
beer slops.
In this saloon were four waiters,
big, husky men, and one of them ran
his hand down beneath the neckband
of the drunken man’s blouse, lifted
him to his feet and shook him, and
tried to make him understand that he
was drunk and must get out; but the
man was too far gone, and the bully
ran him down across the floor, his
legs dangling loosely like those of
the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz,
and shot him, slamb-bang, through
the swinging doors into the street.
He was just another of the thou
sands that could not get drunk on
beer. I saw 12 men drunk on beer
in that one saloon on Craig street
that night, and I saw fully 50 men
there who were in various stages on
the road to drunkenness.
With a newspaper man as guide I
went that night into 12 saloons
where nothing was sold but the beer
which the government of Quebec says
makes for temperance and sobriety.
They were the same old saloons, with
the exception that the men sat at
tables instead of standing at a bar;
and they drank beer instead of
whisky.
There were the same old smells,
same old maudlin songs and laughter,
same old vulgarity, same old quar
reling and wrangling, same old
drunks. Before midnight I saw 100
men drunk on beer, not all of them
dead drunk, but all unmistakably
drunk, and I saw many of them led
to the door and pushed out. On the
sidewalks I saw men staggering, and
around a fountain, in a little open
space, were found men in the condi
tion described in Recorder Geoffrion’s
report: “Lying drunk.”
Between midnight and morning, in
a carbaret and in a half dozen boot
legging clubs and joints I saw hun
dreds of women drinking; many of
them were mere girls; and fully one
third of theme were drunk. A news
paper woman I met that night in a
“blind pig” club where three hundred
men and women were drinking told
me she had seen a thousand women
drunk in such places in Monteral.
In that city are 307 of those sa
loons that sell nothing but beer. I
wondered how many men went out of
them that night drunk with beer. In
Montreal are 500 grocery stores that
sell beer in bottles to families, deliv
ering it as ordered, with the bread
and milk and potatoes, and I won
dered in how many homes in Mon
treal were men and women that
night, and even children, drunk on
beer, who were not counted in the
official “statistics of drunkenness”
that the government of Quebec gath
ers and publishes in proof of the
temperate quality of its beer.—The
Union Signal.

MEXICAN DEVOLUTION 1$ RESULT OF
ODRE6ON’S FIGHT ON DOME'S DOLE
The revolution in Mexico is but a
Catholic defiance of a national gov
ernment.
It is the sword of the church drawn
against the state.
It is the final analysis of the Cath
olic religion.
It is the effort of Rome to subju
gate, with torch and torpedo, a land
it is no longer able to hold with Cross
and Rosary. The Catholic church has
thrown aside its cloak of religious
hypocrisy and drawn a sword.
1 The monarch of the Vatican is
slashing the bodies of Central Amer
icans who refuse to longer be the
slaves of his fat priests, or stint and
starve to fill the coffers of the greedy
Pope overseas.
The Spanish inquisition stalks in
Mexico, and human beings are being
slaughtered for throwing off the
shackles of the Catholic church.
General Obregon, the greatest
Mexican of the century, realized that
his people could never be aught save
peons under the Catholic yoke and he
gave his people religious freedom; he
struck from their minds the shackles
of religious superstition, and gave
them education. He dotted the hills
and valleys of Old Mexico with fed
eral schools; he gave the Mexican
boy and youth a chance to win knowl
edge; he gave the peon a chance in
the fields, and prevented the priests
from hi-jacking him of his earnings;
he brought freedom of body and mind
and purse into Mexico, and gave his
people the only real chance they had
ever had.
He aroused the fierce ire of the
priests, their parochial schools were
all but deserted, their churches were
almost vacant and their coffers
empty. Their fake pleas for cash to
win surcease of sorrow for those be
yond the tomb’s pale portals fell on
deaf ears. The Mexicans refused to
be mulcted of their money by fat
priests, whose lives were immoral
drunken orgies.
The priests began to pldt, and
throughout the nation of Mexico the
Catholic leaders whispered, “We must
destroy the government,” and in the
name of the Pope the ruin of a na
tion was plotted.
Entering Mexico under the guise
of religionist seeking to spread the
Word of God; given freedom to in
culcate their religion into the hearts
of the people of Mexico, it has turned
on the government itself and seeks
its downfall in the name of the Pope
of Rome.
And as you read these lines some
of you Americans better do a little
thinking on your own account.
Just a little thinking.
Across the shallow Rio Grande the
jannizaries of the Pope are seeking
to overthrow a government.
While the Knights of Columbus are
holding military drills in the name of
the Pope, throughout the public
streets of America, other members of
the same order are seeking to over
throw a government that gave them
shelter, and “religious freedom.”
I say it is time for Americans to
do a little thinking.
Catholics in Ireland revolted
against their government and set up
a nation of their own; Catholics in
Bavaria revolted against their gov
ernment and set up a nation of their
own; Catholics in Mexico have turned
traitors to the government to which
they loudly protested their allegiance
and are endeavoring to destroy it in
the name of the Holy Rome; Cath
olics in America are trying to de
stroy the Ku Klux Klan because for-
RIFLES AND AMMUNITIO
An illuminating piece of news has
recently come to light in Scottsdale,
Pa., which for some reason the secu
lar dally papers have failed to pub
lish. This news partakes more or
less of the spectacular, considering
that a relentless war is being waged
by the Catholic Church against the
Ku Klux Klan, on the ground that it
is a menace.
In Pennsylvania they have what is
termed the state constabulary. It is
a police organization working under
the direction of the state, similar to
the rangers of Texas. This organiza
tion received complaints that a Cath
olic Church in Scottsdale was con
cealing a large number of guns and
ammunition. The church was raided,
and the raid yielded 750 army rifles
and a truckload of ammunition, con
cealed in the basement of the church.
We can hardly understand why the

umns are filled with propaganda

300th it dares to stand up and pro
claim America for Americans and
the inspiration for it all comes from
the same source.
And wh,'le these treasonable intri
gues go swiftly forward against gov
ernments in which Catholics were
given a welcome, comes the announce
ment that the Pope of Rome claims
sovereignty over the Papal states, a
kingdom that embraces one-half of
Italy.
And yet, if we as Americans dare
say aught against the political ac
tivities of the arch intriguer of the
world, we are branded intolerant in
the public prints and called foment
ers of religious prejudice, while the
Jewish press hurls vile anathemas
upon our heads.
If a man can’t see, with the lights
of Ireland, Bavaria and Mexico flar
ing before his face, what the inten
tions of the Catholics in America
are, he is blind indeed.
As the Pope has done in Ireland,
in Poland, in Bavaria and in Mexico,
so will he attempt to do in America.
It is as plain as a white star in an
ox’s forehead.
You can’t get away from it.
The intention of the Pope of Rome
is to make of America a Catholic
colony, by artful suasion if possible
and shot and shell if necessary.
All of this fight on the Ku Klux
Klan comes hot from Rome.
Every anti-Klan organization that
is formed in America has a back
ground of fat priests, manipulating
the Jewish-bossed daily papers and
controlling the minds of weak-kneed
Protestants.
You know it and I know it.
I tell you you can’t read the stories
of Catholic atrocities in ancient days
or right now without being a Klans
man in your heart. You can’t study
how Catholics intrigue for world con
trol, incite wars, assassination and
destruction of nations, without won
dering why America permits that po
litical organization to get such a
strangle-hold on the American nation,
or permits the traitorous Catholic
hierarchy to maintain offices in
Washington for the purpose of di
recting the political affairs of this
country. Why should a man whose
allegiance is in Rome have aught to
say in the elections in this country?
I am seeking you why should he?
Obregon kicked the Pope’s personal
representative from Mexico, and the
same should be done in this country.
Religious freedom is one thing, and
paramount allegiance to a man over
seas is another thing. The Pope re
serves the right to control the allegi
ance to this country, or any other
country of every devout Catholic
within his church, and any man who
fails to accord his Pope that right
is not a devout Catholic.
Every Catholic in Mexico is ab
solved from allegiance to his govern
ment by fat priests.
It is pitiful!
It is an outrage at which the
Prince of Darkness, himself, must
stand appalled, that men should enter
a nation under the cloak of religion
and seek to destroy when they have
gained an ascendency.
Again I ask you to look at Ireland,
at Bavaria and Mexico, and think
what is going to happen in America
when the Pope gets control of the
niggers.
You boy? better look out all down
the line.
The facts are too plain to be mis
taken!
SEIZED IN CHURCH RAID
against the Klan, in each and every
issue, failed to print such an impor
tant, and to say the least, unusual
news item. The average newspaper
reader cannot understand why a
church should be converted into an
arsenal, but considering that the
Klan was holding a meeting on the out
skirts of Scottsdale, and were com
pelled to remain in session all night,
as they had been warned that they
would be ambushed and shot to death
on their return to their homes, will
explain the arsenal in the church
basement.
Inasmuch as the controlled press
persists in suppressing all news de
rogatory to the Church of Rome, in
her malicious efforts to destroy the
Klan, papers which will not be afraid
to print the truth should be pub
lished in every city, town and vil
lage in America, supported by the
Klansmen and their sympathizers.
Smile in their face and hang to
your grit.
Some folks die too easy, sort of fade
away;
Make a little error and give up in
dismay.
The Protestants needed are true blue
through and through,
To laugh at pain and trouble and
keep up her grit.
—Kansas City Protestant.

Rookie—Don’s rub it in, Cap! That’s
Just what the sergeant told me.—
