THE CONTEST
riled by the Defeated Candidates
A Number of Charges Made.
The lawyers representing the
People's ticket have filed a contest.
It is a long-winded tale of innumer
able woes, which, put all together
and analyzed, make but a very mild
kick. It is a rehash of all that has
been said with the dreadful Syrians
-eft out. The petition is signed by
Messrs. Gus. A. Breaux, Wm.
Campbell and R. W. Elliott as at
torneys. The petitioners are the
defeated candidates and the follow
ing gentlemen: Jno. Vigneaux,
Phil Crouchet, C. A. Cochrane,
Arthur Couret, J. A. Delhomme,
Alphose Peck, Jno. J. Marsh, H.
H. Hohorst, Alb. Delahoussaye,
H. D. Delahoussaye.
The first part ot the petition is
devoted to the subject of represen
tation at the polls. The fact that
the election was held in the court
room upstairs is mentioned. The
presence of deputy sheriffs at the
entrance is a subject for unfavorable
comment and the booths which
were used to allow the voter to pre
pare his ticket are objected to. It
is alleged that this was a scheme to
vote illiterate men who were pro
vided with tickets by outside par
ties.
With their characteristic modesty
they claim all the ballots thrown
out. It is alleged in the petition
that ballots were marked or de
faced before being given to the
voters and that one of the commis
sioners used a lead pencil to push
the ballots down into the box and
in this manner defaced or marked
them.
Other wild and delirious asser
tions are made in the petition.

The meeting last Sunday was a f
decided success, and those attend
ing were enthusiastic over the pro
posed new church. We predict 1
that Scott will have a church in
the new future. All that is ne
cessary is energy and money, and
we think both are to be found in
and around Scott.
We understand several new resi- I
dences will be erected here within
a short time. This shows Scott is
prosperous. The more the merrier.
The painters were here during
the week and the Southern Pacific

HOO ORDINANCE
Not Legal-A Decision Rendered
by Judge Deballon Settles
that Question.
Some years ago the Police Jury
passed an ordinance which em
powered farmers to kill hogs found
depredating their cropr. Acting in
accordance with that "ordinance,
Antoine Hebert and B. Roche
killed some hogs belonging to John
Solari who brought suit before
Judge Brandt's court for damages.
The suit was decided against the
plaintiff who took an appeal to the
district court, where the decision
of the justice's court was reversed
and the ordinance declared null and
void. Hence, all those who kill
hogs depredating in their fields, can
be made to pay their value.

An Enjoyable Affair.
One of the first picnics of the season was
given on last Saturday, at Chargois' Springs
by the Ladies' Club.
Despite the threatening aspect of the
weather ninety-seven persons were in at
tendance. Three large wagons and many
private carriages furnishing means of trans-.
portation for the merry crowd. A more
congenial assemblage or enjoyable affair has
never been chronicled. At three o'clock an
elegant dinner was served, the -variety of
meats, salads and sweets could not have
been surpassed by a caterer of the Royal
cuisine.
The fortunate participants were the fol
lowing:
Mmes. J. Nickerson, C. D. Caffery, T.

A sequel to the day's pleasure was a very

Mrs. J. E. Trahan. Music, song and dance
lent their charms to the enjoyment of those
present. Delicious refreshments were
served. Mrs. Trahan was assisted in re
ceiving by the Misses Cornay and Young.
A Public Market.
A public market house is badly
needed in Lafayette and it is to be
hoped that the incoming Council
will use every means in its power to
have one built. It is useless to
speak of the many advantages to be
derived from a public market. We
dare say that every resident of La
fayette would more than welcome
the erection of a suitable building
for market purposes. Under the
present system the house-keeper is
put to a greaL deal of trouble to
procure the day's provisions. The
revenues that would inevitably flow
trom a public market would in a
short time pay for the building.
Let the City Council think
seriously of this matter. It is
worth the attention of our council
men who can not give their atten
tion to a better cause.
CARINCRO NEWS.
Items of Interest Gathered by The
Gazette Correspondent at
Carenecro.
The basket picnic given under
the auspices of the sisters of St.
Ann Convent, at the Carencro
Springs on Bayou Vermilion, on
the 5th instant, was undoubtedly
the most enjoyable and successful
entertainment of its kind given
hereabouts. Tlere were some
twenty wagons, anB numerous bug
gies and carriages beautifully deco
rated with bunting and flags, that
pissed through town in form of a
procession. Every vehicle was
loaded to its capacity with light
hearted children, laughing, singing
songs, and waving their banners in
happy anticipation of the glorious
hours they knew would be spent
among the beautiful oaks along the
bayou bank. In spite of the fact
that there were over z5o children,
ranging in size from the "little tot"
to the charming Miss in her teens,
not a single accident occurred and
all were unanimous in declaring
that "they never had so much fun
in their lives." Mother Mary
Joseph and Sisters Clotilde, Ma
tilde and Maurice deserve much
credit for the complete success of
the outing given by them to the
chridren of their school.
Messrs. Sibille Bros., of Sunset,
have purchased a suitable place in
Carencro, where they intend to
erect a large and ornamental build
ing. Their intention is to establish
a general merchandise store. They
declare that it will be second to
none in the parish. The second or
third floor will be reserved and ar
ranged for public entertainment and
known as the Sibille Opera House.

Rev. Father Borias, of Breaux
Bridge was the guest of Rev.
Father Laforest last week.
We understand that the 2nd and
3rd year cane stubble will prove a
total loss. This will cut down the
crop fully 25 per cent. The cool
nights and north winds have had a

Miss Graziella Francez has been
quite sick, but her friends will be
pleased to- learn that she is now
fully recovered.

The Huron Plantation with all
improvements, as well as the Teche

and with the necessary capital to
operate it properly.

living in and around Scott held a
meeting for the purpose of taking
steps toward the establishment of a
Catholic church there. Mr. A. O.
Budro, the enterprising railroad
a;ent, was elected chairman of the
meeting and Mr. P. A. Delhomme

resolutions were unanimously
adopted:
WHEREAS, The constant and in
creasing demand for a public place
of worship, convenient of access to
the population adjacent to Scott is
universal among the people; and
fully realizing as we do, the Imper
ative need of a Christian education
for our children, is a permanent
and paramout duty -we bwe them,
therefore,
Resolved, That we, the citizens
of Scott and vicinity, impelled by
parental obligation, invoke the co
operation of all men, and call upon
all who may feel an interest in this
laudable work to meet together at
P. A. Delhomme's hall (in Scott)

A COW'S HORN.
The Cause of a Law Suit Before
The District Court.
The case of R. W. Elliott vs. Annie
Bachert and husband occupied the attention
of the district court one day this week.
The suit was originally filed in Judge Cof
fey's court by Mr. R. W. Elliott who sued
the defendent for $2zo as damages alleged
to have been caused by Mrs. Annie Bachert
breaking the horn of a cow belonging to the
plantiff. After hearing the evidence and
examing the law applicable to the ease
Judge Coffey rendered a decision allowing
Mr. Elliott damages in the sum of $to.
This did not satisfX Mrs. Bachert who,
through her attorneys, Messrs. Caffery and
Chargois, took an appeal to the district
court.
The case came up for trial before Judge
Debaillon Monday morning. Mr. Wm.
Campbell assajted Mr. Elliott and Messrs.
Caffery and Clargois represented Mrs.
Bachert.
A number of witnesss were sworn and
testified. All gave pretty straight testimony
going to show that Mrs. Bachert had, with
malice aforethought and without any pro
vocation, broken the horn of the docile and
unsuspecting bovine whose only offense was
that she -ndulged in a little friendly scrap
with the defendant's cow. It was fully
shown that after the unfortunate cow had
been deprived of a horn she was not the
same genial, well - met animal that
she had been heretofore. She was often
nervous and fractious, at times morose and
melancholy and always manifested an aver
sion to the society of the other cows of the
neighborhood. During her convalescence
she was properly attended to having re
ceived the attention of the veterinarian,
Charley Canada, whose skill in the treat
ment of all domestic animals is well-known.
An eminent physician of Lafayette was
sworn in as an expert. At this time a
gentleman entered the court room holding
in his hand the broken horn and several
small sticks. One of the sticks was sujposed
to have been used by Mrs. Bachert when
she struck the fatal blow. The doctor first
examined the horn. He said it was a
sound horn and seemed to be enjoyng. good
health, but he could not speak in the same
way of the collectpon of sticks. Being
asked by one of thlattot neys for the plain
tiff, if, with one of the sticks as a weapon,
John Sullivan, Corbett or even Fitzimmons,
could break a cow's horn, he replied in the
negative.
An experienced farmer testified next.
He offered a considerable amount of valu
able information upon the act or science of
"dehoraing" cattle. He said that while
the operation was not calculated to beautify
the animal, but was extremely mortifying to
a cow solicitous for her personal appearance,
he did not think there was anything serious
about it.
Several character witnesses testified.
Nothing derogatory to the reputation of the
cow was brought out. On the contrary
from all reports she enjoyed a name second
to none for deportment.
When the evidence was all in the attor
neys addressed the court. Two of them
spoke for Mrs. Bachert and the other two
argued on behalf of the plaintiff.
One of the attorneys paid a beautiful
tribute to the cow. She was a kind, gentle
creature and was never known to be guilty
of a mean act, and would not knowingly We
do harm to any one. She was evidently a
cow of great worth and of sterling qualities
and it is safe to say that were she a politi
cian, she would never consent to vote
dagoes in order to be elected a member of
the City Council.
The judge took the case under advisement.
Although the amount sued for is only $20
the costs may go up to over Sroo.
Wall paper. Pretty patterns.
Great variety. " Pleasing prices.
