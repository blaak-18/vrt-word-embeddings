Something About Chinamen
There are many Chinese in this
country. They come here solely to
better their conditions financially and
at heart don’t care a snap for the
Christian God. They always belong
to the coolie class —the human scum
of China—and are smart enough to
adopt any old form of religion that
will bring the American dollars to
their opium scented pockets. They
den up in the cities like hogs, live on
food that would not keep a cur dog
alive, work like galley slaves, and
save every cent they get their long
carrot fingers on. As soon as they
accumulate a few thousand dollars
they lope out for China. Even when
they die here, they have their miser
able leprous carcasses shipped home
for burial. This is about the only
decent act they ever perpetrate.
Where Chinamen secure a foothold
in this country they crowd out all
American labor, as they work at sal
aries that would mean starvation to
even the most frugal white laborer.
Their principal trades are running
laundries and restaurants, and they
seldom if ever fail to grow rich
where an American in the same busi
ness goes broke. One of the princi
pal reasons for this is the undeniable
fact that they give good service and
work cheap. A Chinaman will wash
your shirt clean, iron it to perfec
tion, do little or no damage to the
fabric and return it promptly. He
does his work thoroughly and care
fully by hand. The average Ameri
can laundryman will run your shirt
through half a dozen “mangles”
(very correctly named), bust hell out
of all the buttons, rip out the button
holes, grind off the shirt tail with a
threshing machine until it won’t
reach over half way down where it’s
needed most, and if you are a real
thin man apt as not when you open
up your bundle you will find a shirt
inside big enough to cover a rhinoc
eros, with possibly a couple of corset
covers and a dilapidated chemise that
belongs to some woman on the other
side of town whom you never met in
your whole life.
The Chinese restaurant man will
give you a square meal served quick
ly for a reasonable price. It always
looks clean, and if it isn’t clean you
never find it out. If you feel like it,
you can cuss him out ad libitum and
it doesn’t bother John in the least.
If you patronize his American com
petitor next door, you frequently
have to order your supper before
leaving the dinner table or you won’t
get it served before bedtime. The
service is frequently slovenly per
formed, you pay the limit in price,
and the cooking is usually done by a
corn-field nigger that couldn’t prop
erly boil water over a red hot stove
without scorching it, and if you
make any remark about it, you have
to whip the proprietor and all the
A Heroic Chaser of Thieves
Some men are born to trouble as
the sparks fly upward. One of them
seems to be Francis Joseph Heney,
who has been prosecuting the San
Francisco graft scandals for the past
several years. Just now he is in
more or less trouble of his own,
partly because of charges that he
gave nothing in return for moneys
drawn from the Government, and
partly because it is alleged that he is
making use of his position as prose
cutor in ’Frisco for the political ad
vantage of Rudolph Spreckels and
his crowd. Charges and counter
charges have followed each other so
rapidly, and the whole situation has
been so obscured by mud-throwing
that it is impossible at this time to
arrive at a clear conclusion. But two
things seem to stand out as certain
ties. One is that Heney has uncov
ered a mighty lot of rottenness in the
hired help. It’s not always popular
to tell the truth, but I’m telling it
when I say that the American hash
slinger is about the worst on record.
It is this very reason that causes
thousands of men to patronize an
infernal bias-eyed Chink when oth
erwise they would prefer the Ameri
can. It is only natural that a man
wants the best service to be obtained
for his money. The above comments
are made to explain the principal
reasons why a Chinaman succeeds
where the American fails.
Referring to the Elsie Sigel case,
she was a local missionary for Chi
namen. She taught them English
and Christianity, teaching them sep
arately and privately.
In China a man never has anything
to do with a woman until he is mar
ried. The young men never speak
to a girl except in company of her
parents. Here the Chink is closeted
for hours with his white teacher.
He seldom if ever fails to become
violently infatuated.
Elsie Sigel was a beautiful girl,
even if she didn’t have any sense.
Physical beauty doesn’t have any
connection with brains whatever. In
fact as a rule they are seldom com
bined. Elsie had two Chinese
mirers. She probably believed they
were interested in their souls’ sal
vation when that was the last thing
they were thinking about. Elsie’s
pretty ankles, or snow white hands,
and bare arms were the attraction
for these yellow beasts, and through
jealousy one of them murdered her
in cold blood. That’s what she might
have naturally expected.
I have no sympathy with Ameri
can men or women either who persist
in making fools of themselves in
such manner. The money spent each
year by these junketing self-appoint
ed sky pilots and alleged mission
aries to China, Japan, Africa and
other foreign countries can be much
better spent buying food and cloth
ing for the poor, miserable, starving
American children that infest the
slums of our great cities, and who
never heard of Jesus Christ in their
lives. Some of these missionaries are
doubtless sincere, but a man can act
the fool in all sincerity. It’s a trav
esty on common sense to see a man
leave the United States to preach to
a Chinaman, when there are hun
dreds of white children living in
filth, poverty and crime in his own
city. If you have a dollar to spare
to the uplifting of fallen or helpless
people for God’s sake spend it at
home and don’t chase off to Africa
and spend it trying to teach a kinky
headed coon that porterhouse steak
beats roasted lizards. He won’t be

City of the Golden Gate. The other
is that he will never quit. The job
must leave him, and not he the job.
The whole affair reminds one of the
old vaudeville jest of the man who
went into a restaurant and gave the
waiter his order.
“Give me two eggs,” he said, “one
fried on one side and one on the
other.”
The waiter seemed puzzled, but
bowed courteously and retired to the
kitchen. Soon the sound of a migh
ty turmoil came from the cook’s do
main. In due time the waiter ap
peared, wearing two black eyes, a
scratched nose, and a torn collar. In
one hand he carried a dish. “There’s
been a little trouble in the kitchen,
mister,” said he. “You’ll have to
take your eggs scrambled.”
That’s about the way Heney has
been getting his eggs. They were
3&ff<trsonlan
scrambled so badly at one time that
an almost successful attempt was
made to kill him in the court room.
The would-be assassin’s bullet passed
through his head, but did not inflict
a fatal wound. It only stirred Heney
up. After he got back to his work
the attorney for one of the defend
ants began an attack on Heney’s per
sonal character.
“Stop right there,” said Heney. “I
let that sort of a thing go on once be
fore, and as a consequence so much
feeling was stirred up that I was shot
from behind. I want to serve per
sonal notice on you that if I am shot
again, it will be from the front—and
I’ll be cracking loose a little bit my
self.”
Not very dignified language, per
haps, but shucks; he’s not a very dig
nified lawyer. He’s a rather under
sized, red-headed, smooth-faced lit
tle man, with a pair of twinkling
eyes and a face that beams and spar
kles when he talks —if he happens to
be in a good humor. When he isn’t,
it sets as hard as Vermont granite.
He was born up in Lima, N. Y., in
1859, which makes him just half a
century old now. The Irish blood in
him came to the surface in plenty of
boyish scraps around the old Market
House in San Francisco, to which he
removed before he got to the age of
mustaches. Old folks thought him a
tough kid then. They haven’t
changed their minds.
He was admitted to the bar and
went to Arizona to practice. The
tough characters of Tucson, finding
that he proposed to prosecute cases
in which they were involved, set out
to run him out of town. He bought
a pair of heavy revolvers, and had
patch pockets made on the front ele
vation of his pants, so he could go
into action in a hurry. He went on
prosecuting. By and by one “bad
man” of particular badness tried to
kill him because Heney had taken his

Dear Tom: —I love to talk about
you and it seems as I can’t help but
talk to you a little. I was up in Vi

gratulate Allen Hunt for his short
letter in The Jeffersonian, but the
poor fellow’s door was locked by the
sheriff and he gone. While there I
walked in the' bank and asked the
cashier if he kept up with your writ

mire you, for you would publish
things you could not substantiate. I
said you published in the Jefferson
ian that only 10 per cent, of the
money ever got to where it was in
tended. I told him you would not
publish or utter one word you could
not prove. I want you to publish
this again if I am correct, stating by
request of your friend. I love this
man next to yourself that had this
chat. I told him you was the great

have made you several converts down

wife’s suit for divorce after he had
been warned. The bad man was bad,
all right—but Heney was worse. The
man-slayer was so full of lead by the
time Heney’s pockets ceased erupting
that he had to be carted away on a
dray. Then he went to San Francis
co. A man came to him with a graft
case that involved some officials.
“I won’t take it,” said Heney. “It
only offers hard work and little pay.”
‘"You’re a crook —like all the oth
er ’Frisco lawyers,” sneered the
would-be litigant. “I’ve peddled this
all over town, and not one will fight
a thief.”
That made Heney mad. He took
the case, worked hard, and got prac
tically no pay for it directly. But it
made Knox, then attorney-general,
look up the fussy little fighter, and
Knox placed him in charge of the
Oregon land fraud cases. Heney
shook the graft tree, and a United
States Senator and an armful of oth
er prominent officials fell down.
Then he wanted to go into private
practice, for he hadn’t made any
money in all these years that he had
been fighting fraud. But Rudolph
Spreckels came to him to clean up
San Francisco, and Col. Roosevelt re
inforced Spreckels by a personal re
quest. Heney agreed, if he were
given a fund to fight with and the
services of W. J. Burns, the best op
erative on the United States secret
service staff.
“If I go in I’ll never quit, even if I
find you’ve been grafting,” he said to
Spreckels. It was all very well as
long as he only forced the conviction
of Abe Rues and Mayor Schmitz. But
lately he has been prodding Patrick
Calhoun, one of the wealthiest men
of San Francisco and a power in pol
itics, and the city has accumulated
cold feet. “Let up,” says ’Frisco.
“We’ve had enough.”
“But I haven’t,” says Heney.-
