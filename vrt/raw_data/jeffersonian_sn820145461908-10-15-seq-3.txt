LETTERS FROW THE PEOPLE
England, Ark., Oct. 5, 1908.
Moses Wetmore, Esq., Chairman
Democratic National Finance Com
mittee, Chicago, 111.
Dear Sir:
I have received your invitation to
contribute to the Bryan and Kern
campaign fund, and it recalls inci
dents and declarations. When I was
purchasing agent for the Farmers’
Alliance at St. Louis I asked your
firm to sell us goods for cash, at the
same price you gave to wholesale
merchants. You replied, “If you
want our goods, go into the market
and buy them.” I presume this is
the same Bryan that, in his Madi
son Square speech, came out in favor
of government ownership of the rail
roads and is now against government
ownership. The same Bryan that, one
year ago, was advocating a parcels
post and government savings banks,
and is now against them. The same
Bryan that said the money question
was settled and last January de
nounced asset money and now ap
proves of asset money for the banks.
The same Bryan that made a speech
to the Arkansas legislature favoring
the initiative and referendum, and is
now opposed to it.
The same Bryan that disapproves
the President’s order dismissing the
ruffianly negro soldiers that shot up
Brownsville.
The same Bryan that, not content
with greeting the negro Bryan and
Kern Club, seated on the lawn and
served them with chicken pie.
The same Bryan that, when he sur
rendered to Roger Sullivan, Pat Mc-
Carren, Tom Taggart, and other gam
bling, whisky and corrupt bosses of
his party, said, “I submit my individ
ual opinions to the better judgment
of my party.”
The same Bryan that betrayed the
People’s Party and Tom Watson in
1896 and lost the presidency by it.
The same Bryan that Thos. W.
Lawson, the Wall street gambler, aft
er he abandoned the people’s cause
forever, said he would give $500,000
to elect.
The same Bryan that has become to
Wall street sane and safe, and that
Belmont and Thos. Fortune Ryan are
doing their best to elect.
The same Bryan that told a com
mittee of organized labor that “work
ing men were public beggars.”
No, no, Moses! Your Bryan has
has too many “fool-the-people quali
ties,” in him to suit me. Kindly
excuse me.
Yours respectfully,
R. B. CARL LEE.
M. S. Cheshire, Moultrie, Ga.
If we are not sadly mistaken, old
Colquitt will be found in the Wat
son and Williams column in No
vember. Still, some negroes will vote
for Bryan and Kern. God forbid
that the white men of Georgia will
swallow the Black Pill, and elect the
man who says that he is after the
money that is in it and not the honor
of being chief executive. I have six
boys, all over twenty-one years old,
so you can count on seven votes from
my family, if we all live.
FROM A PENNSYLVANIA JEW
ELER; BRYAN AND THE
CATHOLICS.
Columbia, Pa., Oct. 6, 1908.
Dear Sir: The American Citizen,
of Boston, Mass., seems to advocate
the election of Bryan in preference
of any of the rest of the many that
are in the field for the presidency.
I wrote them, asking why they were
working for Bryan, when he was
down on his knees to Rome as well
as Taft, and their reply, which is
short (I enclose same), is a comment
on you, and, by the way, my paper
used to come in a wrapper, but now
it doesn’t, which is an indication
that there are more than one getting
the paper in Columbia. Some time
ago I had forty copies mailed to dif
ferent persons in Columbia and no
doubt some others are taking the pa
per. If so, I claim the credit of get
ting some one interested. Mr. Ezra
J. Weaver, of Lancaster, got mC to
subscribe for the Jeffersonian.
Yours respectfully,
A. K. BRUBAKER.
(The letter he enclosed:)
110 Tremont St., Boston, Sep. 30, ’OB.
Mr. A. K. Brubaker:.
Dear Sir: Your favor received and
papers sent. Tom Watson is a good
fellow and the Prohibition candidate
is a good man. But we want to de
feat Rome and Roosevelt, and there
is no hope for defeating Teddy ex
cept through Bryan —though we do
not care much for him. Yours,
R. J. LONG, Editor.
(Note: The Boston editor is in a
fix. He likes Watson, but will not
vote for him. He likes Chapin, but
will not support him. He doesn’t
think much of Bryan, but is for him.
The reason given is the funniest thing
of all. The Boston editor wants to
deal a blow at the Roman Catholics,
and believes that the best way to do
it is to elect Bryan! Norman Mack,
Tom Taggart, Charles Murphy, Pat
McCarren and the Tammany push
generally will be amused when they
hear of this.
WTiy, Bryan wouldn’t let his Den
ver Convention begin its work until
after a Catholic bishop had “led us
in prayer,” and his managing men
are Catholics. Would Bourke Cock
ran, a rigid Catholic, be making
speeches for Bryan if the Boston ed
itor’s view of the campaign were cor
rect?
Would Tammany—which represents
the Catholic Church in New York pol
itics —be ardently for Bryan if his
election would mean the “defeat of
Rome”?
Really one of the anamolies of this
queerly mixed campaign is that the
Methodist preachers of the Middle
West should be taking such an active
part for Bryan when his campaign is
so largely controlled by Roman Cath
olics.)

Out of the twelve sample copies of
the Jeffersonian, which you sent me,
I got nine subscribers. You have
large following here, and it is grow

DOCTOR BALDWIN STANCH AS
EVER.
Cuthbert, Ga., Oct. 7, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson.
My dear Sir: As I passed through
Atlanta from Washington, D. C., I
stopped a day to get some things that
I w r as in need of. I met a friend and
he informed me that he had seen in
some paper that I belonged to some
new party. I told him that it was not
true. Now, some time ago, I was in
Judge James K. Hines’ office and
while there, there came into the
judge’s office one, Mr. Howard, of
Alabama, and the judge introduced
me to him and he talked awhile about
some party and soon left and before
leaving asked me to help them in the
party. I told him that I was not in
politics now, that I intended to vote
for you and no one else, and but lit
tle more was said about it. Now,
some time after that, some one I
do not now remember, wrote me
from Atlanta and asked me to let
them appoint me for some position in
the * party and I declined and then
the same one wrote to me, asking me
to let them use my name for some
purpose, and that they would not ask
me to do anything and for my life I
can’t remember whether or not I even
answered the letter. Possibly I did,
and if I did, I am sure I did not
agree to act with them. One of my
sons laughed at me this morning and
said some one had sent me a lot of
political stuff. I have not seen it at
all yet, and do not even know what it
is; but one thing sure, I shall have ab
solutely nothing to do with whatever
it may be; I will not have anything
to do with it. My wife has just
brought it into my office. I will not
open it, but I will cut off this I send
you and now I think of it, you may
have sent it; if so, let me know, and
if you did send it, I will open it. I
had intended to write you and ask
you to send me some tickets, for I
intend to vote for you and work for
you all I can. Some of the fool al
liance men at Carnegie have fallen out
with you, so my daughter, Mrs. Per
ry, told me just before I started to
Washington, D. C. She went down to
Carnegie to work for your journal and
paper. I have not had time yet to
go down there, but will do so as soon
as I get over my trip.
Now, I wish you to know that I will
never have anything to do with any
party except our party, though the
devils are trying to make it hot for
me. But I find a great many men
who intend to vote for you that will
not say anything about it. I can’t
understand such conduct and can’t
have any respect for a man who is
afraid to speak out his feelings.
Well, well, send me the tickets if
you have not done so. I will not
open the package I have unless you
say you sent it. I do not like for
men to misrepresent me, though I
have never heard anyone here men
tion anything about my belonging to
a new party. Am too unwell to say
more, so I bid you good-day. As ever,
your true friend,
M. A. BALDWIN.
GOOD NEWS FROM TEXAS.
Gilmer, Texas, Oct. 2, 1908.
Hon. T. E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: I enclose you a ILt of
subscribers that I have obtained for
the Jeffersonian.
I have just returned from a trip
I have made through some of the
counties of Eastern Texas. I find
that the truth of Populism still has
a deep root in the hearts of our peo
ple. The Texas Populists will again
rally to the support of the Omaha
Platform. I hope that you will be
able to come to Texas and make a
few speeches at once. You can accom
plish great good.
You will find list of names on an
other sheet. I enclose money order
for $1.50.
Yours for equal rights to all,
J. M. PERDUE.
(Note: lam very sorry to be una
ble to go outside of Georgia in this
campaign. Our friends in each state
are earnestly urged to take hold and
do the very best they can. —T. E. W.)
A MACON FRIEND WRITES;
JUNE PRIMARY NOT BIND
ING AS TO NOVEMBER
ELECTION.
Macon, Ga., Oct. 6, 1908.
Mr. T. E. Watson.
Dear Sir: I have just returned
from a short trip in Georgia and gath
ered in some information from near
Macon, and you are unquestionably
the choice of the majority of Geor
gians. Mr. Gilbert, a friend of yours
from Marion district, told me this
a. m. that a great many people felt
bound to vote for the national ticket
because they went into the June pri
mary. We Pops are doing all we
know to impress the fact that we only
went in as white men and not ortho
dox Democrats. You know that the
leading Bryanites are endeavoring to
make the impression that we who
voted on June 4 are honor-bound to
hold up Bryan. If it can be made
clear that our obligation is only to
Joe Brown, it will do good.
On November 2 we will have a
larger crowd than we can accommo
date, unless all signs fail.
I am sorry our daily papers do not
publish more news and write edito
rials on both facts and fancies. Hope
you are none the worse for wear.
Yours very truly,
R. E. BRADDY.
P. S. —I hear there is an be
ing made to have you at the fair
grounds. If you go there, it would
be best to have a talk in a. m. and
one in auditorium at night. R. E. B.
(Note: By the express terms of
the Rule adopted by the Hoke Smith
Executive Committee the White Pri
mary was to bind nobody any further
than to vote for the nominees of that
primary.
Hoke then expected to get all. of
the Populist votes, as he had done in
1906. After his own swell-headism
and mistakes had caused his defeat in
the June primary and he realized that
the old Pops would never forget and
