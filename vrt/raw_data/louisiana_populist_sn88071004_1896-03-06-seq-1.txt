POMEROY ON MONEY.
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION VERY
ABLY HANDLED.
"Money It Anythlng That the Law of the
Lead Says I. a Full Legal Tender for
Debts, and Has No Legtlimate Power Ex
cept to Pay Debts."
"My son, what is money?"
"Anything which the law of the land
says is legal tender for debts."
"What power has money?"
"None except to pay debts."
"Has it no power to purchase, to
buy things?"
"No. If the person who has some
thing which I want, declines to sell it
to me, then I cannot get it from him
unless I steal it or take it from him
by force."
"Suppose the one you may owe will
not take the money you offer him?"
"He has the right to refuse anything
I offer him, even if it is money, but
when I tender money, being that which
the law says is legal tender, he has
no right to put me to any expense or
inconvenience after I have made him
wrseder of what the law says is legal
4leder mosey."
"How em yoeg ue money ?"
"T'o pa my debts, or trade It for
plmethias whiek I wllk to hav-4and
tSe otheropreon is wiltd to selLame."
'g"Who says sot Who ays that mIutey
is amything which "thi'giernment says
is legal tender.'
"My fkthqr so taught me."
' Whbdeaseays so?"
"The 'uvernument. every govern
ment in the world: that is every inde
pendent government."
"Who else?"
"The supreme court of the Gaited
States and every other court In the
world. For lastanee:
"A litigant ia.tlhe supsa court of
Iowa, who had loaned gold dollars, ob
jected to recetving greenback dollars
in payment. He claimed that they
were of less value than the dollar he
had loaned. The supreme court, In
rederinag its decision said:
"'The gold dollar is not a commod
ity having an intrinsic value, but
money having only a statutory value.
And every dollar has the usme value 1
without regard to materlal.'-Iowa Re
ports, Vol. 16, p. 54G.
"The attorney general of the United
States, speaklng of the legal tender act
(12 Wallace, p. 510) says: 'We re
peat, momey is not a subetanee, but an
impression of legal authmrity; a
printed legal decree.'
"The function of all money Is to pay
debts, and what the law says is momey

The Democrats of Texas will possi

affairs, but they will kiss and make cc
up on the county candidates. pr
When this country returns to a one
hundred cent dollar prosperity will p
return. Money is now out of the
reach of all except the favored few.
Finance, land and transportation, we in
repeat, are the burning quest!ons. tt

and justly settled. Monopoly must go.

There cannot be too thorough an or

state. The gold conspiracy must be D
overthrown, and it requires a major
ity of the votes to do It.
The cent per cent gang in the east- y
ern states have had their way long g
enough. The South and West will t

So soon as a county ticket is nomi
nated that moment each candidate be.
comes an active worker for Populist
principles. a
"he evils of which the people com
plain, the injustice, the favoritism of f
the law, can only be changed by chang
Ing the men that hold office, and thus t
put the principles of the People's party
into effect. No reform will ever come
through the old parties, nevw They
are joined to their idols.
The good people of Alabarb will a
make a desperate effort this fall to
overthrow the ballot box stufiing de
mocracy and Texas must do the same
act in many counties. The political
conscience of a Democrat is of rubber,
and he can and wlIn stretch it far
enough to count his candidate in. Or
ganize. Populists, organize.
In 1866 a 500-pound bale of cotton
was worth $210. A farmer could buy
a given bill of supplies for $32.96, leav
ing him $177.05 In cash. In 1895 a 500
pound bale of cotton was worth $25.
A farmer could buy the same bill above
mentioned in qualit) and amount for
$9.45. leaving him $15.55 fn money from
his bale of cotton. Do you see any
difference?
When the Hon. John Hancock signed
the Declaration of Independence, Aug.
2, 1776, be said: "There must be no
pulling different ways, we must all
r hang together," to which Hon. Ben
jamin Franklin, who was standing by,
replied: "Yes, we must all hang to
geth'er, or we shall all hang separate
ly." -so it is with us Popolists and
brother reformers, we must act as one I
man at the polls.
And now comes the Hon. John H.
Reagan In an open letter inviting and
urging Populists to return to the
Democratic party. Well, hardly. We
all remember the spider and fly epi
sode. Come to us, judge. We'll treat
you right, and, as to defeating the
goldbug Democrats, we'll attend to
I them. All of the free silver Democrats
except the leaders in and out of of
fice will vote with us.
The gold oliarchy want all treasury
notes taken up and bonds issued in
I their stead; the perpetuation of the na
tional banking system; our currency to
be controlled by corporations, and to
consist of gold, bank notes and silver
as a subsidiary 'money (to make
change with); in other words, the
English system of finances. Are you
in favor of it? If not, you should vote
the People's party ticket.
a Hon. James G. Dudley is out in a
t long article showing (to his satis
; faction) that he is right and that the
r "sona' munney" oyster roast crowd
are all wrong. Just fight it out, gen
tlemen. The Populists will stand to
one side in complacency and watch
the result. In the meantime the silver
Democrats, the reformers in the Demo
cratic party, barring the leaders In
Sand out of office, are joining the Peo
ple's party.
Barney Gibbs put it down about right
when he said that the leaders of "both
the old parties continue year after
t year bellowing and pawing up the dust
like two piney woods bulls that never
either fight or grow any bigger. It
Is a perpetual game of cussing the
I rascals out and cussing the rascals in
Sand never letting the people vote on
a the issue ltelf by itself." We are
"leader" ridden, "leader" cursed and
almost ruined by "leaders."
p Senator John Sherman in his late
- book, page 254, vol. 1, says: "Silver
- dollars were not in cireulation in 1861.
I Their issue was provided for at the be
I ginning of our government; but, asi
they were most of the time more vain
able than gold coin of like face value,
Sthey were hoarded and exported." Yet
he atands in the United States to-day
rand dghts every proposition to re
I. monetise silver. What'should be done
with suceh men?

What a Pet Lagi Did.
A pet eagle recently picked up the
2-year-old boy of Mr. and Mrs. J. I..
Morrison of Gaineville, Fla., and car
ried him 70 feet in the air before the
mother's eyes. The young eaglets,.
which were in the eagle's nest near the
house, began to scream and the mother
bird turned and slowly descended.
When 40 feet from the ground she
dropped the boy in a cedar bush, and
he was not seriously injured.
Malaria mo the Mississippi Bottems.
From the Banner-Democrat, Lake
Providence, La.
The swamp lands along the banks
of the Mississippi river in Arkansas.
Mississippi and Louisina are gener
ally considered very unhealthy in con
trast with the hilly country adjoining
them. It is here the germs of malaria
are formed, and from which originate
those terrible malarial chills and fevers
which the people of the low couptries
dread. In addition to these are inter
mittent and remittent fevers, dyspep
sia, Indigestion and rheumatism, all
caused from malarial germs and the
dampness of the atmosphere.
Medical science has been put to its
utmost capacity to devise some mode
of treatment by which these physical
allments can be moderated, if not erad
icated, but so far it has failed. Nor
does it seem that there can be found
r any cure for these symptoms. Such
has been the general opinion until re
cently, when Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
found their way here, and came to
stay. Today those who have used
them say they would not do without
them for all the medicines in the drug
stores.
Mr. Dan. O'Sullivan, Sr., is a promi
nent citizen of this city, Lake Provi
dence, La., and has been identified with
its interests for years. At present he
t occupies an important position on the
City Council and is also secretary 9f
that body. He was once a strong, ro
bust, healthy man. full of vigor and
1 always on the go. Within the last
year, however, his health has been
very bad, his appetite poor, his diges
tion poor, in fact, his entire system was
completely out of order. He began to
use various medicines, but to no pur
t pose. At length he decided to try Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.
In a few days the change for the bet
ter could be noticed. He continued to
a improve so fast, that the proprietor of
the Lake Providence Banner-Democrat
interviewed him and asked him what
t he had been taking to put him in such
* good shape again. His reply was in
substance as follows:
"My liver was all out of order, my
c digestion was very bad, I felt sluggish
and did not want to do a thing but
lay around the house. My blood began
to get thin, and I felt sick all over. I
a concluded to try Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills, as I had heard so much about
them. After taklng them a few days
L, I could feel that they were doing me
I1 great deal of good. I continued the
use of them, and in a week or so I felt
like a new man. They toned up my
r stomach, put my blood in good condi
tion, gave me a good color, a good
appetite, in fact, put me in a first
Sclass shape again. My friends con
i, gratulated my return of health, and I
smiled when I told them that Pink
Pills did the work."
t Mrs. D. H. Parker, who was raised
SIn the olty of Lakt Providence, but who
now resides in Greenville, Mississippt.
also uses Pink Pills. Her husband, Mr.
D. H. Parker, a popular traveling
salesman of the Drummond Tobacco
Company, of St. Louis, says that for
Syears his wife had been suffering from
a dyspepsia and indigestion, that she had
to be very careful what she ate, and
would frequently have severe spells
from being a little imprudent in her
r diet. She mt for some Pink Pills,
took themi and is now well and strong,
and can eat any and every thing with
out belag affeoted in the slightest man
aer. She is loud in her praies of Dr.
Willams' reat remedy. She also suf
I tered from rheumatism, and that too,
has left her.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain all
the elements necessary to give new life
