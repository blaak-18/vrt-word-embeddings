The Public Hui It the Hoads and Harriman Nolv "Exploits Them.
HARRIMAN.
No better and no worse than others of his
class, E. H. Harriman is a fair specimen of
the product of Modern Commercialism.
He is the monarch of the great transconti
nental railroad which was built at public ex
pense. The Union Pacific did not cost pri
vate capitalists a dollar, but private capital
ists now own it all.
He represents that system which farms out
to private greed the powers of government.
State Legislatures do his will, from Califor
nia to New York! The powers of taxation
are his. Juggling the stock and bond issues
of his corporations, he can levy such rates
upon traffic as compel the people to put value
into hundreds of millions of dollars of fraudu
lent, fictitious capitalization.
“Taxation without representation” was a
dogma of tyranny against which COLON
IAL AMERICA AROSE GUN IN HAND!
Taxation without representation is Harri
man’s specialty, and WE ARE TOO ROT
TEN AND TOO COWARDLY TO RE
SIST HIM.
A Debated to the Adbocacy of the Jeffersonian Theory of Gobernment.
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, March 21, 1907.
Openly, bravely, he defies law and public
opinion.
Acts of Congress make it a crime to stifle
competition and to make agreements in re
straint of trade.
Harriman laughs at the law. and commits
the crime. The facts arc on record.
Ordinarily, he who sells what he knows to
be worthless, or not suited to the use intend
ed, is a common cheat and swindler, amena
ble to the law: Harriman sold tens of mil
lions of dollars of stock which he knew to be
worthless, and when asked about it by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, cynically
answered:
“Did anybody tell the public that the stock
was good?”
How many millions of dollars has Harri
man taken from the public under the Wall
Street forms of legalized robbery ?
Nobody knows. From one little railroad,
the Chicago & Alton, he and his pals took
nearly $24,000,000. Into one stock juggle,
water to the extent of $60,000,000 was
poured.
Where opportunities like these are ex
ploited by such men as Harriman, the sums
involved almost defy comprehension.
“What’s a little matter of two or three mil
lion dollars?” he coolly inquired, concerning
some trifling transaction which he was re
quested to explain, and could not.
Two or three million dollars are clearly a
small matter to a man who has only to mon
key with stock issues to pocket $24,000,000.
After the startling and shocking revelations
which were made in response to those ques
tions of the Commission which Harriman
condescended to answer, no one can doubt
his status as a hardened, confirmed, method
ical law-breaker. What we would have
known him to be, had he answered those
questions which he refused to answer, must
remain a matter of conjecture.
That he is a criminal; that he has been
guilty of frauds; that he has accumulated vast
fortune and power by the most flagrant
