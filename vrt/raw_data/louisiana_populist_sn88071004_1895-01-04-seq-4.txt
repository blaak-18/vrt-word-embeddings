Carnegie's Pull.
The other day the Navy depart
lient of our great and good Gov
e(rnlcunt testt-d one of the armor
plates which Carnegie had offered
as a sample of the lot which he
propoted to use on one of our new
battle-shilps.
The test waS made at Indian
llead under the usual rules, and
tale plate cracked under the test.
CT:'he missile fired against it broke
it. Ordinarily, the sample being
defective, the goods would be re
jected.
Mr. Carnegie's part of the con
tract is to furnish plates which
will not break. The test was or
dercd by the Government for the
purpose of determining whether he
had come up to his contract or not.
The cracking of the plate proved
officially and publicly that he had
not done so.
Therefore, by all the known rules
governing business transactions, it
seemed that the Carnegie plate ar
mor would be rejected.
But not so; Mr. Hebert, becre
tary of the Navy, having ordered
the test and having been notified of
its failure, promptly announced
that he would accept the entire lot
of Carnegie's armor, anyhow.
Then why go through the farce
of having tests made
If Carnegie has such a pull with
the Government that the contracts
with him lhind the Government
without bmding him, we oughtl.o
save the time, trouble and expense
of useless tests of his defective
material. We ought to accept
whatever he otTers, without any
t sts.
Last year Carnegie was caught
in the act of swindling the Govern
ment out of several hundred thous
and dollars.
Co2mmodore Sampson, of the
Navy, and Congressman Cummings,
of the Hosae Naval Committe,
made oficial reports in which Car
negie's systematic and gigantic die
honesty was clearly shown.
Mr. Herbert himselfreported to
the same i'tect to President Cleve
land.
1The fact that a colossal awindle
had been lwrpetrated ulpon the
Govefinamenut was so apparent that
Mr. Cleveland had to realize it and
take action.
lie compounded the felony by
letting C~arnegie of with a money
payayent which left him in full pos
session of all the sume paid him for
the faulty material and more than
$100,000 in premimtI.
Preminams are exta sums paid
by the Government as an induce
me nt to honesty in eontracts.
Mr. Carnegle'a pumnshment con.
siated in lbeing made to refund part
of this eitra pay.
Now when it m remembered that
Carnegie ought to have been pros
ecuted for felonions practiees, the
fact that he was let off with a nom
inal ane, is proof of the high favor
he enjoys with our Democratic
