The regrettable lose from the vieq
point of the department, declares the
secretary, is that of the macaroni wheat
crop. For the first time an experiment
had been made this year in the produe
tion of this variety of wheat on a large
smale in the United States. Secretary
Wilson has been encouraging this eN.
periment ever since he has been at the
head of the agricultural department
and imported the seed from northern
Africa where most of the wheat is pro

world with macarouL
The ientm, is espeolefy hopeful of
an average eorn mop. He says it will
not be a record breaker or "a bumper`
In the parlance of the agricultural do
partment, but that at this moment the
prospects favor a fair average yield. Mr.
Wilson said:
"If something could be done to indasm
the farmers in the corn belt to extend
their period of cultivation about twe
weeks this year beyond the usual limit
I would look fora bog crop. But the
usual season for cultivation is rapidly
drawing to a close, and I fee: that with
comparatively few exceptions the farm.

"In the entire core belt, with the ex"

The oobs belt soil, with the esoeption
