The IKst sample of ml'lt.o,es we
have seen this season was mnade byI
one of Bayou Bourileaux's colored 1
farmers, Gus Bolulen. In addition t
to his usual crop of corn and cot- t
ton, he raised cane enough to make
a thousand gallons of molasses and
three hundred pouinds oif sugar.
Gus isa hard working, energetic
citizen; coimmainds the c nfidence
and respect of bis eoninnitt yn", and
deserves a good deal of credit for
his close application to agriculture.

Quite a crowd witnessed the am
eteur performance on Friday even
ing at the Opera House. As we t
failed to attend, we are forced to
rely upon the opinions of others
as to its merits; and are pleased
to note that one and all pronounce
it a irst cis performance. We
hope that another will sooF be in
order.

A Case ot Big Head.
When any man feels that he is
called upon individually to formu
late a policy for the Populist par
ty it is a sure sign that he needs
self-examination to see if that in
sidious disease known as "big
head" has not attacked him. A
good thing to do then is to retire
to some quiet place and endeavor
to take a tumble to the fact that
one man is a very small affair in a
great pohtical party which formu
lates its own noliey by well organ
ized methods and limits the right
of no one individual or clique to
dictate to them.-Educator, Knox
ville, Iowa.

Democrat says, 'tthe vote at the
"mixed primaries" at Rayville on
Tuesday last, was 106 colored and
26 whites! How is this for mixed
primaries! Out of a reso4istered
vote of 400 in the Rayville ward,
only 132 votes were cast."
The "mixed primaries" plan was
suggested in the interest of the har
mony and unity of the Democrat
ic party, of course.

In view of the Republican land
side it will occur to thouhlitful
I)emocrats that it is time for their
party in this State to quit wrang
ling and fall into line. Instead of
hautmering each other the )emo

any means, fair or foul, and then
with an arrogance equal to their
knavery, the people will lie asked,
in the name of harmony, to stop
fusing; fall in line and vote the
ticket. The party should get to
gether. But thie most effective
way is to give bosses such a remuke
that they will learn to respect
something besldes their selfish do
sires. About one lesson like that
taught Gorman, would go a long
ways towards restoring lpairty har
