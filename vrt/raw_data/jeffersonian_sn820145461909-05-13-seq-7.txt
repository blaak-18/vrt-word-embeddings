touch with each other, which only can
be done through a national organ
similar to The Commoner, will prompt
you to send the renewal for your
paper at once. The editorial depart
ment of the paper, which will have my
personal attention, together with other
special features, including an ably
edited home department, current topic
discussion, and general news matter,
makes The Commoner a high-class
paper of interest and profit to all
members of the family and especially
to young men and women whose
futures are always benefited and
brightened by pure reading and high
ideals.
I will appreciate a few lines from
you as to the result of the vote in
your precinct; what, in your judg
ment, caused the loss or gain, and
whatever suggestions you may care
to make for the future good of the
party.
Again thanking you, I am,
Very truly yours,
W. J. Bryan.
(Answer.)
Owing to other work, and the at
tention which we had to pay to the
3,000 houses which our fool Govern
ment is building for the Dagoes in
Italy, and likewise to activities which
certain parsons have developed in
themselves and us, we have not re
sponded to Mr. Bryan as promptly
as is our wont. For tins appearent
irresponsiveness ' we hrave his for
giveness. ...
We hasten to assure Mr. Bryan that
he is welcome to the 11 interest and as
sistance” which we contributed to his
campaign last year. We hope that he
will not mention it. It is true that
we did our level 'best for him, but
we claim no thanks, and we beg that
he will regard what we did for him
as the results of the irrepressible
promptings of inextinguishable zeal.
We quite agree with Mr. Bryan that
his defeat should not dismay anybody.
It was an event that was not wholly
unexpected. Premonitions of what
was going to happen, strengthened by
the recollection of what had happened
twice before, had in some degree, pre
pared us for the calamity. Still it
was a severe blow, and we are ncrt
surprised to learn that Mr. Bryan
feared that we were dismayed and
discouraged. Not in the least, Wil
liam, —not in the least. In fact, we
feel that we can stand it again, if
you can, and we’re pretty sure that
you are persistently preparing for
another patriotic ordeal.
Mr. Bryan informs us that he is
once more on duty editing his paper,
and that he hopes to have our con
tinued support. He shall have it, just
as heretofore.
Mr. Bryan earnestly recommends
that we renew our subscription to his
paper, not that he cares so much for
his paper, as that he thinks the salva
tion of the country demands the
maintenance of a national organ which
will keep the Democrats in touch
with one another. We fear that this
is a disguised joke, “Democrats in
touch with one another!” That’s
fine.
Mr. Bryan wishes to know how the
vote stood at our precinct. The fig
ures would not cheer him up, and we
forbear to give them.
Responding to his -request for a
piece of our mind, on the cause of
his defeat and on the future good
of the party, we give it as our opin-
ion that he lost his chance by posing
as Roosevelt’s heir, by abounding the
principles for which he had so long
combated, by failing to attack the
extravagance and centralizing tenden
cy of Roosevelt’s administration, and
by not taking a bold stand on the
Tariff Money questions.
As to the future of the Democratic
party, it hasn’t got any. It is house
divided against itself, and it must
fall.
NECESSITY FOR THOROUGH
ORGANIZATION.
No. Franklin, Conn., April 26, 1909.
Mr. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
My Dear Sir: 1 read your “Letters
From the People” with a great deal
of interest. By reading them I find
a great demand for an organization
of all the reform forces. It goes with
out saying, that this must be done,
before anything permanent can be ac
complished, in changing the present
conditions. Some one must take the
initiative. As no one has come for
ward with any practical, feasible plan
that I have seen, and having been in
the movement for more than 30 years,
I have been studying out a plan, which
I believe will unite every sincere re
former into one solid body, to the end
that by 1912 we can have an organiza
tion in every Congressional District,
if not in every voting precinct in the
United States. It can be done, pro
viding that every man who wants to
see it done, will do, each his small
part or share of the work. Jefferson
believed in the people. If present
conditions are ever changed for the
better, it will have to be done by the
people themselves.
Mr. Editor, in order to test the
sincerity of the readers of this article,
and are enough interested to send a 2c.
sitamp for a reply, I will send the
details of the plan I have carefully
studied out, and submit it to a refer
endum vote of those who are inter
ested enough to write. In the last
election in November, for President,
it is a well known fact that there
were but a very few voting precincts
comparatively, that had any Populist
tickets, and no one to take charge of
them, had there been any. This
proves the absolute necessity for a
thorough organization. There is no
doubt, had there been even one inter
ested person in each voting precinct
in the United States, there would have
been hundreds of thousands of votes
cast for the Populist candidates.
There were no tickets, no system, no
method, simply because there was no
nuited action, no organization. Bro
thers in the cause of humanity, shall
we let this happen again without mak
ing a systematic effort and commence
now? It is for you to say.
Yours in justice and equity,
J. C. Vallette.
RESOLUTIONS FROM WELLSTON.
GA.
Wellston, Ga., May 3, 1909.
Whereas, The proper handling and
distribution of the cotton crop is of
most vital importance to the Southern
farmer. Therefore, be it resolved :
That we heartily endorse the idea
of establishing bonded warehouses—
for the holding of cotton —thus ena
bling the grower to gradually market
his crop, thereby avoiding the present
‘Saffersonlan
suicidal policy of disposing of his
cotton in a few months.
Resolved further, That we recog
nize the ability and influence of the
Hon. Thomas E. Watson and desire
to express to him our appreciation of
his recent publications in behalf of
the farmer and to ask his continued
efforts on the line of devising some
plan to change the present system of
marketing cotton.

AS TO SOCIALISM.
Ijos Angeles, Cal., April 15, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Editor Jef
fersonian.
Dear Sir: I read with interest your
remarks on socialism, and also the
communication of Mr. Wilks, and
would like to call his attention to the
kind of socialism advocated by the
Wayland type.
One of our most prominent socialis
tic orators before a large audience in
this city, was asked the question,
“What will you do with the millions
of Rockefeller and other million
aires?” His answer was, “We pro
pose to take them.” Socialism, then
means wholesale robbery.
Mr. Allen L. Benson of Milwaukee,
an author on socialism, declares that
every able bodied man would be com
pelled to work for a living, and re
ceived labor checks for pay, abolishing
all other mediums of exchange.
What would be the result if labor
checks were all the money our busi
ness community was allowed? What
would be the result if land, machinery
and all private property was owned
by no one, but common to all? Bro
ther Watson’s revolution would then
be a certainty.
If Socialists would adopt Populistic
ideas, something might be accom
plished towards wiping out class legis
lation, and the monopolistic thieves
who have cursed our country long
enough.
G. Major Taber.
A FARMER’S AND LABORER’S
PARTY.
Jonesboro, Ga., April 26, 1909.
Dear Mr. Watson:
1 think the United States needs an
independent Farmer’s and Laborer’s
Party to be composed of white men
to work out our government problems.
'Pile party should be formed on this
line.; when three hundred to five hun
dred members organize in each county
and state let each member pay SI.OO
membership and any member be al
lowed to take from one to one million
shares.
Conventions should be called in
advance of those of the bld parties
and white primaries held in every
county in the United States, running
our candidates in these primaries.
The Catholic church controls both
old parties and the dangers of Roman
Catholicism are to be combatted.
Don’t wait for somebody else but
let each man start in and try to get
up a club.
George E. T. Kelly.
