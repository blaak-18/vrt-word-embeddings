DOROTHY'S DRIVE.
HE contest raged
in South Bilk
shire with a fury
unparalleled
even in thatU
sturdy Lnglisl\
constituency.
The tories did
not rwant to fight, but, by jingo, if they
1 did-- and the radicals of Rottenhata
had for years only wanted a man to
lead them. They had noW found him
I In Jeremiah Clink, of Sharpus & Clink,
solicitors; his firm had long acted for
one of the leading "trade protection
societies" in Rottenham, which gave
him power in quarters where he wanted
popularity; and with the rest of the
constituency his suceeses sttrpistid
everyone, including hinmdilf. Having
cultivated mutattd and cress from boy
hood, frst on his sponge and subse
quently in an old chocolate box, and
having recently developed a pear tree
and a potato patch in his back garden,
he posed as an authority on flatters
agricultural ana prownllted more in the
name of his party than any candidate
had ever promised before. The agri
cultural laborer was attracted by what
he understood to be the prospect of
free land for the asking; and Rotten
hamites, who had been contented with
six geraniums in Bfowept pots and a
tomcat, now dreatned of acres of fertile
soil tenanted by the contemplated
cow and the prolific-or, as a local
speaker phrased it, "profligate"-pig.
Sir George Redworthy, who had repre
sented the constituency in the con
servative interest for fifteen years, felt
that he had his work cut out and he
buckled to like a man. It Was annoy
ing to be interutuptedst such a time by
domestic questions; but love, which
laughs at locksmiths, jeers at politi
cians, and his eldest son and Miss
Dorothy Ditchford, the rector's daugh
ter, selected the morning of the nomi
nation day for informing him that
they had resolved to become man and
wife at an early date, subject to his
consent. Needless to say, Dick Red
worthy met with a very unpleasant re
ception when he broached the subject
in the library after breakfast, and that
Dolly Ditch ford entered an hour later
with a beating heart to see what she
could do. She was a great favorite
with the old gentleman, but he had
never before regarded her in the light
of a future daughter-in-law; timn flies,
and he had always thought her a child.
After ten minutes' talk with her he
knew that if she was only just out of
hecr teens she was certainly a child no
longer.
"Well, my little girl," he said, good
humorodly, "if I get in again, and the
party is in power, I dare say I can get
them to give Dick something to keep
him going till I am under the daisies.
1 never asked it for anything before."
"lBut suppose they don't get in?" said
Dolly, ruefully.
"Well, you'll have to wait: but mind,
1 can't have any engagement till the
election is over. Meanwhile, you make
everyone in the parish vote right, and
you'll have done your best to help, eh?
They won't be able to say no to you.
My agent tells me I shall only win by
a few, if at all," and Sir George took
up his pen. Dolly went to the door,
hesitated, and came back. "Sir
George," she said, shyly, "if you get
into parliament, may we be engaged,
anyhow?"
"lBless my soul," said Sir George,
looking up. "If I keep my seat,
though, I don't know what I won't
consent to; if I lose it, I advise Dick
and everybody else to keep clear of nme
for a bit."
"If I can get him a dozen votes, and
lie only wins by ten or so. he'll feel he
owes it to me, and then I am sure he
will say yes," said Dolly to Dick as
they walked up among the shrubbery.
"and you can tell my father then."
And that afternoon she 'vent into the
village with a sheaf of leaflets in her
hand, and failed miserably when
heckled on topics of tile very existence
of which she had never heard before.
As a matter of fact, she won votes for
the squire without knowing it, but she
was nearly crying at what she thought
was her want of success, when she
met I)ick Iledworthy as she came out
of the last cottage. She felt better
after leaving him, and better still
when she had had a gallop after tea.
It may be mentioned that the downs
of South lilklhire are free to every
one, and there was nothing surprising
in Dick Redworthy taking a ride there,
too.
It was a tug of war witha vengeance,
and there were many interests to be
consideredl. "Sir George's ticket at
the army and navy stores is No. -"
was the placard which nmet the baronet
one day in lIottenham, borne by a doz
en sandwich men, with all the small
tradesmen rushing to their doors to
look at it. "Ask Nrs. Clink where she I
got her red silk stockings," was the
counterblast which brought matters
level. Dorothy Ditchford had met the
radi=al candidate's wife in the "hosiery i
department" at the stores a few (lays
after it was known that Mr. Clink
would standl and that scarlet would be
his color, and Dorothy had an observ
ant eye. lHer own blue and orange hat
was a "dream," worked out under her
own directions by a Rottenham
modiste. It was 1in the window for
three days and she saw herself dis
tinctly reflected by the belles of Rot
tenham at every turn. When she had
done the parish she went further
afield, and the rectory pair did some
hard trotting in those few fleeting
days. "They all say they think they'll
vote for your father if I'll drive them
to the poll. Some of them can't walk.
poor old things," said Dorothy, and
she lined the family wagonette with
brown holland and decked it with blue
and yellow, while the horses' blinkers
could not be seen for ribbons. They
.-ere a sober pair of nags, but with
her on the box they did wonders on
thie great day. The effort, however,
was reserved for the evening, when
the men got home from work.
"th~all we be there by eight?" asked
Dorothy, as Dick Redworthy dashed

is," said old Harry Blackwater, grimly,
amd Bill Stumps, the underkeeper,
nudged him and told him not to snake
a row. But the men behind were all
eragiCng a patriotic song loudly and
merrily. Miss Ditehlifid thought she
Otijigglit a few words in it which were
not in the original when she com

"I won't drive them," she said, be
ginning to pull up.
"Hetter be careful, miss; they're a
desprit lut; nitld tliei'es only two of
iis," said Bill Stumps.
Dorothy set her lips; she was not in
the habit of feeling afraid.
"Ain't there any ancient woter to be
collected up Deadman's hill way,
miss?" whispered Bill Stumps, with a
grill.
Dorothy laughed, too; round went
the horses into a narrow lane, and up
an incline dignified by the name of
bill.
"Hi, miss! you're going the wrong
way," cried .Tohn Bradds behind her.
Ile was a cobbler from Clay Lane, and
a radical as she thought till she found
him waiting to be taken to the poll
with a blie and orange rosette iB his
hat.
"You're going wrong! Turn round
or we'll be late!" cried some one else.
"Can't turn," said Dorothy, decisive
ly, glancing at the hedges on both
sides of her. Presently the road got
wider, and she had to acknowledge
she could tutrnu
"Tip the whole cartload into the
ditch, miss," whispered Bill Stumps;
"OUT OF THE WAY THERE" IEi l SHlo'TED.
"I'11 take care o' you. linut she re
flected that the hedge was low and the
field beyond flinty, and to turn a van
load of poachers out in cold blood was
one thing, but when it included roll
ing with them, even in the protecting
grasp of tobaccoey Bill Stumps, it
looked an unpleasant prospect. A id
she drove back into the Rottenham
road; thinking with satisfaction, as
she glanced at the tiny watch in the
bangle Dick had give n her that morn
ing, that five minutes were gone, and
it was quite a quarter to eight, and a
good mile from the polling station.
They were shouting to her to hurry up,
led by John Blradds, the cobbler, and
Bill Stumps and the headkeeper were
turning round to face the angry men
in the wagonette. She was glad she
had allowed'no one on the box beside
her. The hedge looked soft and green.
Would an upset hurt her very much?
There was a good deal of holly just
there. But the question was not left
entirely for her to settle. WVhat was it
coining up behind? There was a radi
cal horse dealer at Rotterhnm (a
"coner," Dick Redwortlhy called him)
whom Sir George had once fined for an
assault. lie had been taking voters to
tne poll all day in his biggest four
horse brake.
Up it came, brimfull, at a furious
pace behind her, with Mr. Crookinger
himself on the box. "Out of the way
there!" he shouted, while those behind
i:'m jeered and hooted at. Sir George's
colors.
"You've plenty of room," said Dolly
[e herself, and she did not give way at
irch. "Out of the way!" they yelled.
She says she did not pull to the
right, but some of themn say she did,
rAid she certainly looked round as the
.1aders came up, but sihe kept her pair
back, and they hadt not been doing
more than a steady six miles an hour
for at least three hundred yards when
I Mr. Crookinger let his horses go with
I a curse. There was a grinding crash,
I and in the next second Dorothy Ditch
ford was looking as dignified as she
I ould in the middle of a privet bush,
" hoping that the horses were not going
I to kick, and that her father's carriage
was not injured. It had two wheels in
the ditch, and the other two were
spinning round aimlessly clear of the
ground.
S"l'm afraid they were in time," she
( said to Dick Redworthy five minutes
later, when he picked her up with his
dogcart. "They had ten minutes to
do it in by my watch."
"Then 1'll lay against then. Dolly,"
he said. "I put that little watch tive
minutes slow just before I gave it to
you, to keep you longer with me."
"Oh, Dick!" she said. "how could
you?"
And she said "O, Dick!'" again next
morning when he galloped up to the
rectory to say that Mr. Crookinger's
brake had driven up the night before
at exactly thirtyv seconds past eight,
and that the poll had been declared
with a majority of twcnty-three in Sir
George's favor, and she added:
"There were twenty at least in the
big brake, and I had seven of them in
tile wagonette."

A question which must have arisen
in the mind of every one who has eaten
oatmeal from blue porridge bowls or
peaches and cream from blue saucers
is, *-hi dd Hoilsekeepefas eaer allow

richest cream ever sent out of a model
dairy takes on a thin, milky look in a
blue bowl. As for mere milk, it seems
like the very skimmed, half-water
fluid dear to the professional humorist.
Jhltie is a charming color for tableware,
but the inside of a dish which is de'
signed to- hold cream should be of a
rich yellowish tint, that will intensify
the quality of the dairy product.
A plate is an awkward dish upon
which to pile sliced bread for break
fast or luncheon. It has an unrivalled
faeulty for seattering crumbs: A
rather shalloW breid basket is much
better. Very pretty ones, made of
closely woven glasses in which a line
of green is here and there discernible,
are sold cheaply. The bread basket
makes possible the display of an em
broidered doily as a lining, and is to
be commended on that account.
r'here are still housewives who do
not know that the accoiniciddatitng il
versmiths have invented a sort of
spoonfork for those desserts which
seem to demand both implements It
is a spoon-shaped bit of silver, rather
sharp at the edge, and dividing into
two prongs, with which an obstinate
bit of pineapple may be cut and
speared, while the spoon part insures
the gourmand against the loss of the
surrounding sirup.
'J'able linen embroidered in white
dssssesses 40 advantage over that
marked with colored silks. Its owner'
does not have to replenish her china
closet in order to have a harmoniously
set table. Linen embroidery has an
advantage over silk in that it does not
become yellow with age in washiting.
The regulation tablecloths and nap
kins are most effective looking when
they are adorned only by a narrow bit
of drawn work above their hemstlched
hems, and an embroidered rlonogram.
In the tablecloth the monogram is ar
ranged to lie on the center of one side,
between the edge of the table and the
centerpiece, with the tops of the letters
pointing toward the center. Napkins
are folded in four square parts and the
monogram embroidered in the center
of one division.
There is no place among civilized
beings for the woman who fails to have
a canton flannel under-cover for her
table, or for her who allows the laun
dress to iron tablecloths and napkins
into intricate designs, or for her whose
waitress is permitted to set knives,
forks and spoons in "stacked-arms"
style at each place,or for her who fails
to put ice under her butter during the
dog-days, or for her who does not have
a bunch of flowers or a bit of greenery
on her table at every meal, or for her
who fails to serve hot plates with hot
food and cold dishes with cold viands.

AMERICAN DIPLOMACY.
flew Our Foreign Representatives Appear
In the Ryes oa Mezicans.
The Correo Espanol affects to consid
er the Americans of no account diplo
matically, possessing no moral and in
tellectual influence in the world, and
points to the fact that the United
States have not yet produced a great
genius. We yield to none in our ad
miration for the great men of Spain;
no poet like Calderon has arisen in the
United States, no great and splendid
genius like Cervantes, but the Corres
Espanol should remember that Spain
itself does not produce such giants of
the human intellect every generation,
and it should not forget that the Amer
icans come of that great race that has
given the world a Shakespeare and a
Bacon, colossal minds who belong to
all the world, to all humanity, even as
do Cervantes and the splendid Col
deron.
The French commissioners at the
world's fair at Chicago have made a
report that it would be well for the
Correo Espanol to republish. The
frank and candid Frenchmen avow
their astonishment at the munificent
provision the United States have made
for education, at the school-houses,
which are palaces, at the huge public
libraries open to the poorest, at the
great publishing houses which give to
the world more than four thousand
books a year--all evidences of a re
markable intellectual movement which
a fair-minded journal should take into
account.
The Americans are not alwvays shin
ing successes in diplomacy, and yet
any American may point with pride to
diplomats like Motley, Bancroft and
Lowell, and to the great Franklin,
who, in simple citizens' dress at the
brilliant court of France. obtained a
success that old-school diplomates, all
lace and rufles. might well envy.
Sometimes the United States sends to
foreign countries ministers who are
boors and ambassadors who are asses,
but so do European countries, the his
tory of whose diplomacy is strewn
with stories of absurd and pompous
nonentities! The clear-sighted Napo
leon saw through that sort of Europ
ean diplomat, and played with them as
a cat does a mouse. The United States
have no reason to be ashamed of a di
plomatic record that began with a Jay
and a Franklin and has yet to show a
Foster and a Phelps.-Mexican Finane

I --ne of thbd 'ecent Inventions is am
electrical controlling system for eleva

landing, and duplicate switches corre
sponding to the controlling switches,
also placed at other landings, whereby
the car may from one landing be di
rected to any of the others.
-Among the new inventions there is
ftne which comprises a fiat layer of
leetri' hIeatiiig medium, composed of
an amorphous resisting iliaterial, a
ring-shaped electrode of trianguglar
cross-section, having its flat face up
permost, a second electrode of a coni
cal shape arranged with its base up
permost ant in concentric relation to
the ring, both being arranged in the
saitid 1aefc in the heating medium.
-An improvenidlit in the art of elec
tro-plating with alloys of platium has
recently been made. The process con
sists in forming a suitable bath con
taining a chloride of platinum and the
sulphate of the other metal or metals
desired in the alloy to be electro-de
posited, immerslng in the bath as a
cathode the article to be plated, and
an anode composed of an alloy of the
metals to be electro-deposited, and
finally passing an electric current
through the bath.
-1i. d'Arsonval has introduced into
electrotherapy new processes of elee
tfiation based on the employment of
currents of high frequency. DMM. Apos
toll and MerlioS have been experiment
ing for over a year witht one of his
methods. and they have come to the
following conclusions: Currents of
high frequency, when they completely
envelope the patient and act by self
seotiduetion, are inefficacious and im
potent against the majority of hysteri
cal troubles and against certain neu
ralgic complaints, but the same cur
rents exercise a powerful influence on
the nutritive energy.
-The commission of sewers of the
city of London, Eng., according to an
item in the Times, is now in possession
of a well-equipped laboratory, for the
carrying out of the provisions of the
electric lighting acts and other mat
ters in its charge. The principal work
of the laboratory will be meter-test.
ing, for which purpose complete ar
rangements have been made. The
electrical current is taken from the
street mains of the City of London Co.,
and as under the present system the
current is taken off at a pressure of
between one hundred and two hundred
volts, which is much greater than that
required for the purpose. a special
transformer has been provided.
-One of the most peculiar of the
phenomena of electricity is what may
be called indirect electrolysis, which
the following experiment of Mlr. E.
Andreoli, as related by him in Le Genie
Civil, illustrates: Taking a cell divid
ed into three compartments by porous
diaphragms, a solution of any salt is
placed in the central compartment,
while the two electrodes are placed
in the side compartments immersed in
similar or different electrolytes. The
decomposition of these latter is, on the
current being passed, effected as if the
central compartment did not exist, the
solution in it being unaffected. In
this form the experiment is an old
one, but Mr. Andreoli finds that if a
plate or series of plates is placed in the
solution in the central compartment,
reactions occur which can only be at
tributed to an indirect or secondary
electrolysis.

lie had never been to a matinee before,
and on this occasion found that hii
seat, at a certain swell theater across
the bay, was just beyond those occu
pied by two young women. He paused
doubtfully, while they both looked at
him. Then the fuarther girl began to
gather up her hat, her cape, her bun
dies, a programme and a bunch of
flowers from his seat. All these things
she piled on top of the open box of
chocolates on her knee. Then she i
stood up and he started to pass. The
second girl seemed inclined to keep
her place, but when it was
clear that with the best inten
tions he could not get by her, sate
heaved a large sigh and, clutching the
contents of her lap, rose. Then the
box of chocolates dropped. "It was
my fault." he murmured, and getting
by her he knelt in the narrow space
between the rows of seats and began
to pick up the scattered chocolates.
He gathered m_)st of them, except the
three he was kneeling on, and those he
offered to scrape off if she wished.
Meanwhile the girl dropped her opera
glasses on him and stepped on his fin
gers. When, finally, they were all
seated, she dropped her programme,
She went under the seat for that and
she offered him a chocolate. As he
felt sure it was the one he had taken out
of the hair of the woman in front, he de
. clined. Then, says the Oakland Echo,
she asked him if he had ever read the
book from which the play was taken,
and all through the next act she told
him about it. When it came crying
time she found her handkerchief miss
ing, and he could not do less than offer
her his. At the cad of the act he de
cided to go out for a drink. She had
put her parasol in a new place andl he
fell over it in getting out: besides, the
veil of the first girl's hat caught on his
vest button and he pulled her hatafter
