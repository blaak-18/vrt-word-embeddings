we with the dreamy, get-to-heaven ti

great work for the cause of human- er

The Saloons Voted Out of Oua
chita--What Did It ?
SYest rdtly the local option elet- tl
Lion was held in Ourachita and t
Prohibition won by over t00 Inai- t
.iority. tiO
This plheiioieial elec'tioin is not h
Sing les than a revolution. di
Friday was all unlueky day for 4o1
the whiskey umen. It was a bright
and beaurtifi day. Not a cloudir n'
blacked the sky andt th e golden l
sullrshilfe beamed across the heav- II
ens all day. ti
Both aides worked hard. Buss s(
es were running'in every direction, g
White and red badges were seen
on every hand. The result was, as tl
we have repeatedly predicted, a
triumph for the opponents of sai- I
loons,. But the size of the majori
ty was a surprise to both sides.
Nobody expeeted so large a vote p1
and so complete a victory. The tl
whiskey men worked hard and cc
were led by able and shrewd poli- ea
ticians who have claimed to be in- ct
vincible. But they went down, te
rider and horse, like the hosts of hi
Egypt in the Bed Sea.h
We have not received full returns sa
from all the wards, but, as fitr as
hear from ward 1, Islantl DeSiard, m
is the only ward that gave a ma ri
jority for whiskey, and it only gave o
18 majority.
The following are the only fig
resa we have received: -
Pro. Whiis.

Conl pass box (inl Monro. e 23 7 1192
lest lhinroe.... ....... 25 80

Elder's ............... 125 93
Filllhiol's.............. 90 130
4Loharhor ............ 2 4
SWard 9............ 15
Total...............1505 1066
Wards 7 and 8 will give over 100 r
majority for prohibition m
The election was quiet and or
Sderly and perfectly fair. It is
Sproper to state that 53 votes east p
on certificates issued on the day of
Selection were objected to by the n
-anti-prohibition commissioners atU
Sthe courthouse box and said com- a
missioners refused to sign the re- e
Sturns. This will not affect the re- 4
Ssult. If the 53 votes were thrown w
out the result would be the same.
It is sigtnifcent that Ward 6,
t where they tried prohibition for e
three years and know what it is,
Svoted solidly to eontinue it. It is
Salso signifceut that the city of
Monroe gave over 200 mqjority for e
e prohibition. This shows conclu- n
e sively that the people in tbis town J
are tired of bar-rooms. We are 
, glad that the majority is so decias.
Sive. It shows that the law will be g
Senforoed. It also shows that it is e
useless for the whisky men to
. tick. Thdy must submit to the
. will of the p)ajority and turn their t
faces in i new direction. They

l whisky men must surrender. They
f have no arguments. They have
no orators. They cannot maintain ai
their cause on any other plea than
Selflinterest. Consequently they
go down in every organized fight.

Let us all join in pushing her ban

One of our prominent cotton
Splanters remarked the other (lay
that instead of planting a crop of
I cotton next year and going to the
expense and risk neceessary to
cultivate and gather it, he con
templated going on the market and
f buying about as much cotton as
he would be likely to make and
s saving it until the market opened
S next year. If it costs more to
make a crop of cotton than can be
realized for it after it is made, and
c our best farmers assert that ithi
does, there is more philosophy it
than poetry in our friend's sug- t
gestion. Instead ofplaying out for
labor more than cotton can lie -
bought for at present, besides toil
ing and struggling throngh a
whole year alternating between Ci
Shope and fear, why not buy a crop '
1 of cotton and then sit down and li
wait for the price to go up
There would be money in the C
scheme if the farmers had the cap- s,
ital to engage in it generally.

The fraud and rascality (winked at and
