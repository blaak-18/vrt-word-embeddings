THE PUZZLE.
Mother sent me up to bed:
I was naughty, so she said,
For I told the company
That I once had been to sea —
Told them how the ship bells rang,
Told them how the great sails sang:
It was just a lie, I know,
’Cause I only dreamed it so,
Yet right then it seemed to me
Just as real as real could be!
Must I always stop to say
If I saw a thing by day ?
■Sometimes I don’t really know
That I only dreamed it so:
When I see both day and night
Many a strange or lovely sight,
How can I remember, pray,
Which I really saw by day?

A “HOMEY” SKETCH _
About Some Old-Fashioned Folk, Old-
Fashioned „Shrubs and
Old Mrs. Sikes is a “widder wom
ern,” and she and* her oldest boy,
Jake, are “half croppers” on my
father’s farm. She is tall, gaunt and
scrawny. She has a wisp of half
gray hair about as big* as your little
finger, which she wears twisted into
as tight a knot as she can get it at
the back of her head, and her skirts
are usually rolled up about to her shoe
tops. Bill Green is her son-in-law,
and he lives on our place, too.
Last Saturday morning, as I was
sweeping the front steps. Bill came
by going to the cotton patch. After
I had said “Good morning” to him,
he said, “Jake like to a-died las’
night. ”
“He did! What was the matter
with him?” I asked.
“He had the mareger colic,” Bill
replied. “ They sent for me ’n’ Mary
Jane about midnight, ’n’ we thought
shore from then tell mos’ day that he
wus a-gwine out. He’s a heap better
this mornin’, but he ain’t nigh able
to pick cotton yifr.”
That afternoon I went to see how
Jake was. He was sitting on the pi
azza tuning a violin. I said, “You
must be better, Jake.”
“Yessum,” spoke up Mrs. Sikes
before Jake had time to'reply, “he’s
able to be a-sawin’ on that ol’ fid
dle this evenin’, but hit shore looked
fur awhile las’ night like he wus
a-gwine to kick the bucket. Susie,
you go ’n’ git that bresli broom
’n’ git to sweepin’ them yards,
’n’ don’t you let me has to
tell you ’bout hit ag’irq nuther, fur
es you do I bet I’ll switch you.”
“I’ll just sit here on the steps'/” I
said, when I got a chance to speak.
Mrs. Sikes brought out a quilt and
spread it, four-double, on the edge of
the piazza floor. Then she went in
again, and came out with a hot iron
iand a bundle of damp clothes.
“Are you going io iron?” I asked.
“Yes,” she answered, “I got to
iron a shirt fur Jake to wear a
sparkin’ termorrer, bein’ as he’s yit
a-livin ’.”
There was a little bush, that looked
somewhat like rosemary, growing
near the steps. I broke a piece,
crushed some of the leaves, inhaled
the odor, and remarked, “I thought
this was rosemary, but it isn’t.”
“No,” said Mrs. Sikes, “'that
ain’t rosemerry. Hit’s sweet laven
der. Johnnie, you go ’round yonder
by the smokehouse hi’ git Miss Sal
lie a piece uv that rosemerry to smell
uv, ’n’ don't you scare that sei tin’
hen often that nest, nuther, hi’ don't
you be a-breakin’ none only jist a
piece fur Miss Sallie. Your pore ol’
Granny, what’s dead ’n’ gone, sot
that rosemerry bush thar the year a
fore she died, ’n’ you know she
didn’t want nobody to be a-breakin’
uv hit, but I know she wouldn't care
fur Miss Sallie a-havin’ a piece, hi’
I’m a-gwine to take some uv hit hi’
go ’n’ set hit by your Granny’s grave
es I live.”
Johnnie brought me a sprig of the
aromatic shrub, and then Mrs. S.
gave me the history of her “rosemer
ry bush,” as follows:
“Five year ago las’ July when we
wus a-gwin to the Sanctified big meet
in ’ at Pine Bottom, we stopped at
ol’ man Tim Shirley’s onten the rain,
’n’ I brake a little smidgen often the
rosemerry bush in their yard not
one bit bigger’n’ that piece what
you’ve got. I carried hit in the
house ’n’ give hit to Mary Jane.
“An’ that wus the fust day Bill
’n’ Mary Jane ever courted any. He
wus stopped thar at ol’ man Tim’s
too. Hit- rained ’bout two hours as
hard as hit could pour, hi’ Bill ’n ’
Mary Jane sot out there on the shed,
’n’ talked ’n’ played with that lit
tle piece uv rosemerry ’M throwed
hit at one another, ’n’ done like folks
will, you know, when they air a
sparkin ’.
“An’ when hit quit rainin’, ’n’
we started on to meetin’, Mary Jane
pinned hit on ’er waist hi’ wore hit
to meetin’. She said Bill begged ’er
fur hit off ’n’ on all the time they
wus at meetin’, but she never -would
give hit to ’im. An’ that night when
we got home, she pulled hit off ’n’
laid hit in the winder a-fore she
started to bed.
“An’ right thar hit Lay tell late a-
Monday evenin’, ’n’ Mammy, she
picked hit up hi’ lowed she wus a
gwine to set hit out hi ’ name hit hr
es hit lived hit ’d be a sign that Bill
’n’ Mary Jane ’d marry, ’n’ es hit
died hit’d be a sign they’d break
up, ’n ’ they must a-bin some sign in
hit, fur hit growed as party as you
ever seed, hi ’ they married the fust
day uv the nex’ Jiniwerry, hi’ I tell
’em all hit wus a case uv true love
of I ever seed one.
“Mammio just sot hit in a box
with some sweet basil, hi’ hit stayed
right in that same box tell we moved
over hero, hi’ she brung hit with ’er
’n’ so* hit out thar by the smoke
house. Hit’s jest growed all tlm
time ’n’ don’t look like hit ever has
had a backset,
rsonian
“Pore ol’ thing, she shore did
think a heap uv hit ’s long as site wus
alive.”
“Ma, ’s rosemerry good fur any
thing but to smell uv ’n’ look par
ty?” enquired Johnnie when his
mother stopped to breathe.
“Yes, hit makes mighty good tea
fur some kinds uv sickness, hi’ hit’s
good to put in the quilt chist to keep
the moths onten the quilts, hi’ to
make ’em smell good, hi’ some peo
ple pu,ts hit in their lard to make
hit smell good. OF lady-Polly Draw
dy uster alters put hit in hern, ’n’
ol ’ Mis’ Williams, what we uster live
with, alters put sweet ba'y in hern.
Some people puts mint in their lard,
hi’ some puts hit in sa’serges, but
I don't want nothin’ in my sa’serges
bnt plenty uv sage hi’ red popper.”
“Mint shore do smell good,” de
clared Susie, who had not yet got to
sweeping.
“Catnip smells the best to me uv
anything I ever smelt,” put in Jake,
that being the first chance he’d had
to speak.
“You ain’t never seed no catnip in
your life,” corrected his mother.
“You’ve seed ba’m, but you ain’t
seed no catnip.”
“Well, es I ain't seed catnip, I've
seed some sluff what they said wus
catnip,’’ protested Jake.

OF POST-MORTEM PRAISES.
I've noticed when a fellow dies, no
matter what he’s been—
A saintly chap gi one whose life was
darkly steeped in sin—
His friends forget the bitter words
they spoke bin yesterday.
And now they find a multitude of
pretty things to say.
I fancy when I go to rest some one
will bring to light
Some kindly word or goodly act long
buried out of sight;
But, if it's all the same to you, just
give to me instead
The bouquets while I’m living and
the knocking when I’m dead.
Don’t save your kisses to imprint up
on my marble brow,
"While countless maledictions are
hurled upon me now;
Say just one kindly word to me while
I mourn here alone,
And don't save all your eulogy to
carve upon a stone!
What do I care if when I’m dead the
Bloominbdale Gazette
Gives mo a write-up with a cut in
mourning borders set?
It will not flatter me a bit, no mat
ter what is said,
So kindly throw your bouquets now
and knock me when I’m dead.
It may be fine, when one is dead, to
have the folks talk so,
To have the flowers come in loads
from relatives, you know;
It may be nice to have these things
for those you leave behind,
But just as far as I’m concerned, I
really do not mind,
I’m quite alive and well today, and
while I linger here,
Lend me a helping hand at times—-
give me a word of cheer.
Just change the game a little bit; just
kindly swap the decks.
For 1 will be no judge of flowers
when I've cashed in my checks.

fully remove the seeds. Cut 12 mush
rooms in small pieces, add two table
spoonfuls of fresh bread crumbs, one
tablespoonful of butter, one-half cup
ful of chopped chicken, and a light
seasoning of salt and pepper; have the
batter melted and the crumbs soft.
Mix well and fill the tomatoes. Bake
for 30 minutes, basting often with
melted butter. Whip three table
spoonfuls of cream, add one table

If yon want meat to be tender,
don’t allow it to boil after the first
ten minutes; it should then be moved
back and allowed to just simmer.
Boiling hardens the meat and makes
it tough.
