The Knights of Pythias met last
Thursday night and decided upon
building a castle hall on their lot
on St. Dennis street. The hall is
to be sixty feet long and forty feet
wide, two stories high, the upper
story to be used as a castle hall for
the lodge, the lower story to lie
rented for business purposes. The
question of building this hall has
been talked of for some time, but
is at Ilt in a formidable shape and
the w6rk is expected to commence
soon. It will be a great addition
to the city.

He sleeps well on the land of his birth

He fears no more the heat of the sun.
Nor the furious winters rages.

OBITUARY.
Died at his home on Cane river. Aug.
31st, 1t94. EARIt.e HYio.; aged ten years,
seven months and nine days.
While the breeze went softly by and
the fields looked beantiful and green,
many friends stool round the little suf
ferer, hopeful of his recovery. But alas,
all hopes banished, and G(od took to him
homie, who had been a modlel ,oy in his
home and in his Sunday school.
Little Early was sick only three days,
and did not seem to snffer much until
the last few hours; he called his parents,
grandparents and many other friends,
and gave evidence to all of his resigna
tion to the will of God.
We miness him in the honne, in the Sun
day school, and in the neighborhood, but
we truly feel like our loss is his eternal
gain.
