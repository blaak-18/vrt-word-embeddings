and vote iu this election. The reg

that it will require but a small ef
fort to obtain the new certificate,
and any inan who fails to register
und loses his vote, is unworthy of
bciug a citizen.

THE PAETT NAME.
It was expected that the Baton
Ronge Convention would adopt
some name under which the State
campaign should be made, and that
would hannouize all the elements
which composed that Convention.
This question of a name, was the
one upon which the fight was to be
made, if it had come up before the
Convention, The resolution of
Capt. James G. White of Rapides,
to confer upon it the name of
" People's Party " was hastily re
ferred to the Committee on Address
and Resolutions, betöre that Com
mittee bad ever been appointed
and before any rules had been
adopted for the government of the
Convention, aud was never heard
of again. The discussion as to the
name, came op in the Committee
and was remitted, as we understand
the report of the Committee, to the
Convention itself. The preamble
to the resolutions is somewhat am
biguous, and it would seem that in
default of any more definite action
by the Convention, it is left to eve
ry one of the parties to preserve its
own name and organization if it
prefers to do so.
The fit nt four words of the pre
amble, before it mentions anything
atout party or parties, says : " We
the White People " &c., and from
this we consider that we have au
thority to call the name, " Whit«
People's Party." As this only in
volved the change of the word
"Man's" into "People's," aud as
" people's " is perhaps more appro
priate than " Man's " which is not
as euphonious as the former, we
were very ready to make the
change, still retaining the word
1 white."
But wheu it comes to leaving off
" White" altogether, and calling it
the "People's Party," it then be
come a new and distinct organiza
tion. The substitution is that of a
rather conservative name, aud mod
ified policy for a strong name aud
decided policy. If the Convention
was composed of white people, and
represented only the white people,
and we think it could not have
claimed to represent many black
people, and it sees fit to declare in
just so mauy*word8 both of these
tacls. we aie at a loss to account
for the squeamishness of certain
Journals in adopting a name which
clearly deelare just what the Con
vention did. The naine " People's
Party " is much weaker in this,
that as the negroes are under laws
which we can not nullify nor repeal,
a part of "the people" the inference
is natural that the " People's Par
ty " represents the blacks as well as
the whites. That this inference is
false and that the people's party, if
so called would not represent even
a Corporal's guard of negroes, the
history of past campaignsabnndant
ly proves and our experience in this
election will most certainly demon
strate. Then if we are right, and
the new party which has not yet
been christeued, represents only
the ichite people, aud does not rep
resent any ot the black people, we
can not tor the life of us see, why
the Bulletin should call it "Our
Ticket," or the Louisiana Democrat
name it " People's Party."
No where else in the platform is
the word people used and where
that word is immediately preceded
by a qualifying adjective which
distinctly calls atteution to what
sort of people it is, we challenge
•the authority of any Journal to
leave off the word '• White " and
use only the modified and uiiex
pressive form of "people's party."
We believe that if Capt. White's
resolutions had been called up after
the report of the Committee of
Twenty-One, the Convention would
after some little discussion, have
adopted it as a compromise, with
scarcely a dissenting voice. It was
not called up and the Convention
adjourned without settling the ques
tion of name, which the Committee
had found it impossible or unwise
to settle among themselves. We
don't know that it makes any great
deal of difference any way, as we
will all vote for the State Ticket
and the Parishes can select such
name as they please for their or
prnriiritior!*. thon» is oup of
two courses to pursue, either to
disregard the platform of the Cou
vention as to name and for the
parishes to settle their own party
name, or look to the platform and
l>e guided by it. We don't well
see how it is practicable to disre
gard the platform and if we look to
it, its only indication as to name
is " White People's Party."
However, the Parish Convention
which meets here to-day can settle
this question for themselves, and
they are entirely competent to do
so. We expect them to pursue the
same wise course that brought
about harmony at Raton Rouge,
aud hope it they touch the name
question at all, that they will in
making any changes, lie guided by
the sole purpose of uniting nil the
people of Rapides, and it it is nec
essary to do this, to adopt 110 name
at all, then let them nominate their
ticket of good men and call it sim
ply " Parish Ticket," or leave it al
together without a naine.
The Parish Convention,
Upon the action of the Conven
tion which meets today at the
Town Hall, depends mncli of the
welfare of Rapid?* for some time to
come. If they act harmoniously,
aud have but one pni-|iose in view,
aud that purpose be the good of
our pariah, and from the character
of the delegates selected, we are
more than confident that they will,
then all will be well and our suc
cess is assured. On the other
hand if a disposition to place men
iu nomination that are not the
choice of the people, aud who can
not unite all of our strength in their
support prevails, there is danger
that dissatisfaction will produce an
apathetic feeliug that will cause
our defeat.
The Convention should have no
one to reward and no one to pun
ish, but take a comprehensive
view ot the situation aud select as
standard bearers, the best aud
most available men for every posi
tion. The men selected however,
should lie not only competent, but
brave and tried men, who will be
ready to enter into any contest
that may bo necessary to secure
the rights and liberties of the j>eo
ple. The present usurpation may
at r empt its game of fraud, and not
gracefully submit to the voice of
the people, and in that event, if we
should succeed, which we do not
doubt, our representatives should
be ready to assume any responsi
bility which is required, in behalf
of the rights and liberties of their
constituents, without hesitating or
calculating the consequences. The
present campaign will exhibit the
pleasing spectacle, of a grand up
rising of the white people, in their
majesty and power, who are deter
mined to shake off their shackles
of oppression, and enter the contest
for civil liberty and constitutional
government, and adopt the means
necessary to seenre the fruits of
their victory when it is obtained.
Revolution may be a dire uecessi
ty, and we say let "it come, before
we again submit to fraud and usur
pation.
T he D an'l P ratt G instand.—
We call particular attentiou to the
advertisement in another column,
of this celebrated Ginstand. The
Dan'l Pratt Gin Company have
been very fortunate in the selection
of an Agent for Rapides Parish.
Mr. John A. Williams, is a thor
ouglily reliable business man, and
in his large business both as Mer
chant and Receiving and Forward
ing Agent, comes iu contact with a
great many of the most staunch of
our plauters. The excellencies of
the gin staud and the low price.
$4.00 per saw only, will no doubt,
enable Mr. Williams to dispose ol
a great many of their Stands. We
need not tell our planting friends
any thing else about the Pratt Gin
stand, its reputation is too well es
tablished.
EF* It is of the utiqost impor
tance that every white man in the
Parish should know that the Reg
istration now going on, is to be ac
entirely new one, and that those
who do not register now can not
vote in N;>v om'îpr.
The Bail Boad.
The Police Jury meets on Mon
day, and will doubtless have to
dis|M>8e of this question. We are
no less opposed to the proposition
than we were when 'it was first
made, and have but little fears of
the action of the Police Jury. On
ly one member so far as we have
been able to ascertain is in favor of
it as it at present stands, and if
they do their duty, they will refuse
to submit the pro|H>sition to a vote
ot the people. When the rail road
inen ask for a great deal less mon
ey, and are prepared to give guar
antees aud satisfactory evidence of
their ability to build the road, it
will be time for the Police Jury to
entertain their proposition - as it
at present stands, none of these es
sential conditions precedent have
been complied with, ami the Police
Jury should ignore the present pro
|H»sition entirely.
We have heretofore fully shown
what the amount is, that instead of
8300,000, they ask for $720,000
when the $480,000 interest isadded
to the principal —that the interest
would be $21,000 pe r year iu
greenbacks , equal to $42,000 Parish
paper—and that they do not pro
pose to give any guaranty that
they will build the road any further
than the sixteen miles, from here to
Lecomte. We reprint here » short
extract from Mr. Kellogg's Speech
to the Chamber of Commecre in
New Orleans, which we published
in our issue ot August 15th, which
settles the whole business:
" It was our original intention to
commence the road at Vermillion, but.
the New Orleans and Texas Rail Road
interfered with uni* operations. We
have therefore thought it proper to
commence at Alexandria a»d work to
Sh rereport , bat we may conclude to
follow mir first intetitiou should cir
cumstances permit."
• • • • •
•' These before mentioned parishes
hare donated bonds amounting to
$ 1.350,090. We can not use these bonds;
there is no maiket t'«i them in Europe;|
and no sale here ; they tcill do to pay
our taxes with."
Tuese extracts are from the N. O.
Times' report of his speech.
He says that they have " thought
proper to commence at Alexandria
and tcork t > Sheveport" and further
on that " ire can not use these
bonds," " they mil do to pay taxes
with." By his own mouth do we
condemn Mr. Kellogg. He was to
give us a railroad to New Orleans,
and now he says he is going to
build it' to Shrevcport. He asks us
for bonds amounting to $720,000 to
help him build the road and says j
that they will not help him any, !
but will do to pay taxes with. Let
1 • „
file Police Jury then sa> to Mr.j
Kellogg, build your road with yonr|j
own money, to suit yourself, either
to Shrevef»ort or New Orleans or
any where else. We will give you
a tree right of way, and enter into
a contract with you and your Com
pany, that the parish tax on your
road in this parish shall be remit
ted for twenty years. You build
the road, and we will not ask you
for a dollar parish tax for twenty
years. This will answer you just
as well, as yon can only use the
bonds to pay taxes.
Now we are tired ot the everlast
ing rail road, ami we need our
space for other things. We hope
the Police Jury will dis|>ose of the
whole thing and relive us ot the
burden of discussing the question.
If the people want to tax themselves
to build a road and give it away,
they can do so, but they do it uow
with their eyes wide open.
Let no man l»e satisfied with
registering himself, but let him see
that his neighbor goes with him
and obtains the new certificate
without which he can not vote in
November.

21 m Section tf a Gluk.
The death of O. K. Hawley,
Clerk of the Oburt for this Parish,
left a vacancy which has been fill
ed by Kellogg, the usurper, by the
appointment of Mr. Levy Wells.
The question which has been dis
cussed here with no little interest
tor the last few days is whether
there is or not to be an election lor
Clerk this Fall. We have taken
&ome pains to inform ourselves as
to the law applicable to the case,
and we auswer the question in the
negative. The Clerk is not to be
elected until Nov. 1876.
Under the Constitution of 1852
this question came up in the case
of John R. Rausdell vsM. lt. Arial,
in this parish: C. E. Jouet t bad been
electee! clerk and resigned and Mr.
Arial was appointed by the Judge to
fill the vacancy. An election just
like this came on and the same quea
tiou came up, that now presents
itself. Mr. llansdell was elected
clerk and sought a mandamus to
force Mr. Arial to give up the office.
It was denied and went to the Sn
p renie Court, where thqy held that
the first elect ion of Jouett was for
four years and the ap|»oiiitmeiit of
Mr. Arial, made by the Judge un
der the law then, was tor the whole
unexpired time of the four years.
This case will be found in the 13th
Annual Reports, page 459. The
same doctrine was held in the 11th
e gg bave made all offices
Annual, page 693 iu the case of
Gusman vs. Walker, and also in
the case of the State vs. Morgan
12tb Anjiual, page 712.
The differences between the Con
stitution ot 1852 aud 1868 in this
respect are n »t material. If they
were, the "powers that be" have
taken pains to leave no doubt on
the subject. They have persitent
ly sought to give the Governor the
appointing jiower in every instance
where it was |M>ssiblc, and if they
could have doue so, would doubt
appoint
ive instead of elective. Taking the
Constitution of 1868 aud changing
the order of the articles that bear
upon the oubject, so as that they
come in logical sequence we find
that Art. 83 says :
during the ecess of the Senate, by
granting commissions, which shall
ilt »'j" of \\™ S «' s
sinn thereof, unless otherwise pro
v j ,|,. t i f or in this Constitution; but
10 | MIS on who has been nominated
for office and ieject by the Sen
• • • •
" The Clerks of the District
Courts shall be elected by the qual
ified electors of their respective
Parishes, and shall hold their office
for four years."
Article 61 says:
" The Governor shall have power
to fill vacancies that may happen
ate, shall be appointed to the same
office during I lie recess of the
Senate."
Article 120 anys :
" The General Assembly may de
termine the mode of filling vacan
cies iu all offices for which provis
ion is not made iu this Constitu
tion."
Then comes Article 2606 of the
Revised Statutes of 1870, aud de
clares that :
" Whenever any vacancy occurs
in any office. State Parish or Mu
nicipal. in this State, now existing,
or which may hereafter be created,
from death, resignation or from any
other cause whatever, the mode of
filling wbich is not provided for in
the I'oiistitution, all such vacancies
shall be filled, it they lie State or
Parish offices, by appointment of
the Governor with the advice and
cousent of the Senate, which ap
poi lit incut shall be for the entire un
expired term of such vacant office
If the Senate lie lu t in session at
the time the ap|M>intinent is made,
the vacancy shall Im filled by ap
pointaient by the Governor, which
appointment shall expire on the
third Monday after the meeting of
the next sessiou of the General
Assembly thereafter, unless the
time for which the vacancy exists,
expires sooner.
From all ot which we conclude
that we are not to elect a Clerk .it
this election. This leaves out of
discussion the advisability of elect
ing one, eveu if we were entitled to
do so. Our own opinion is that
it would bave been better, in that
case to tollow the precedeut set by
the State Convention at JBaton
Ronge, in the case of the Auditor
and the Executive Committee bad
resolved to so advise the Parish
'Convention.

Oiganlsitla tad Threatening Atti
tude of the
TWO NEGROES AND ONE WHITE
MAN KILLED.
From the Shrereport Tim««.
Yesterday very startling news reach
ed this city from K«d River parish.
Mr. VV. B. Hamilton received a letter
trom Mr. H. C. 8tringfellow, dated the
28»h, from Cotton Point, abont twenty
miles »hove Conaliatta, stating that
800 armed negroes were below the lat
ter place threatening the extermina
tion of the whites. The letter stated
that bnt I wo hundred whites were con
fronting them, and aid was needed,
and the opinion was expressed that v
collision was imminent.
Seventy-flv* men in this city with
arms and eqnipmen*« were immediate
ly monn«ed in two bodies, one under
command of Mr. H. C. .Bogart and the
other nnder Mr. N. B. Murff and des
patched toward Coushalta; while the
steamer Clifford waa cot ready, com
missnry stores procured, and artang
ment» made to reinforce the cavalry
with a hundred infantry who were to
have left last uight on the boat.
Late in the afternoon we received an
extia from the Itepoiter, of Mansfield,
stating that the negroes we»e concen
tarting neaj Brownsville, almut fifteen
mils lie In iv Conaliatta ; that two negroea
aud one while nian° hat been killed ;
that Mr. Joe Dickson had been shot
and severely •omitled, in Conshatta,
by a squad of negroes. ; that twenty
five white men had left Mansfield, and
a hundred and fifty would leave that
night to reinforce »nr red river parish
friends. Previously we learned that
forty men had gone down from Cotton
Point and a hundred from Beard's land
ing. During the day dispatches were
sent na from Mm shall, Jefferson and
Longview, offering prompt assistance
it needed.
#Late last evening, while prépara
Tions w«-re going rapidly forward for
the movement down the river of a
large ho«l,v of men, a eonrier arrived at
tbe Times office with dispatches Mat
ing that the leaders of the radical par
ty in red river parish had lieen cnptiir,
ed by the whites, and that the negroes
disconcerted by the captme of their
hiefs had rapidly disbanded. The
following are Jhc men who have been
captured, and who doubtlessly at the
instigation of Kellogg, got op the riot
with a view of provoking the President
to send troops to Noith L-ni»i<ina :
F. S. Edgerton, Sheriff; H T. Twitched,
Tax Collector; lit gister; R. A. Dewees,
Tax Collector of DeSoto; pati*h; Gil
bert Cane. Deputy Clrrk. W. H. How
ell a ed—Scott. In addition to these,
six n<'gro chiefs where captured.
The captme of these fellows put an
end to the war, and» courier was im
mediately dispati-hed hither. Tl>e
courier met the Shrevcpoi t men on the
road, tifren tuiles from town, and turn
ed them back. One party arrived here
about fight last night and the other
will bo here this morning.
Any additional facts we may be able
to obtain we will promptly lay In-fore
the public. The courier informed u«
that when lit left the seat of war up
wards of fifteen hundred white men,
well armed, had concentrated there,
and others were coming in, bat cour
iers had been sent in every direction
to turn them back
