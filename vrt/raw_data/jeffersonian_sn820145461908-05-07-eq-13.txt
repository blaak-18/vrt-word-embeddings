historic precedent and constitutional au
thority should study the debates of the
Convention of 1877. He will see clearly
why it was that the county organizations
were cut into forty-four groups (mainly
of three counties each) and given one
Senator each, without regard to popula
tion.
Then he will see that,, even in the
make-up of the House, the principle of
pure democracy was not strictly regarded.
It is provided that, once in every ten
years, a new allotment of representatives
shall be made and that no matter how
much the six largest counties may exceed
in population the hundred and odd small
counties, the six shall have no more than
three members, while the small counties,
no matter how much population they may
lose, shall still have one member each.
Twenty-six other big counties are given
two members each ,but no matter how
much the “next to the largest” twenty-six
counties may grow in population, nor how
much the hundred and odd small coun
ties may dwindle, the big twenty shall
have but the two members, while the lit
tle county units shall still keep their one
member each.
Can you not see how carefully the fram
ers of the Constitution were safe-guarding
the weaker communities from the possi
ble tyranny of the strong?
If you would but read the speeches of
Nelson Tift, A. R. Lawton, Robert
Toombs, and others, —debating this ques
tion of representation by population and
by territorial organizations,— you would
better understand the dark plot which
lurks behind the revolutionary rule which
the new Committee has adopted.
The control of your State is about to
pass into the hands of the ringsters of the
big cities.
Is that where you want it? IF SO,
YOU AND THE WHISKEY INTER
ESTS AND THE CORPORATION IN
TERESTS HAVE FOUND YOUR
WAY INTO THE SAME BED.
Heretofore, in nominating a candidate
for governor, the state has adhered to the
Constitutional method.
All the counties were equal, excepting
that to the six largest and the twenty
six next largest were given the Consti
tutional allowance of advantage.
But under the new rule the County
units are ignored and the majority vote
will rule, no matter how much of that
majority may be concentrated in a few
big cities. The practical effect will be
that Atlanta, Macon, Augusta and Savan
nah will each have twenty or thirty times
the vote of many smaller counties, instead
of having (in conventions) only three
times as much, as prescribed by law and
precedent.
To clinch the advantage of the major
ity, those counties which vote for the los
ing candidates are to have their conven
tion delegates chosen by the successful
candidate. THUS, THE MINORITY
COUNTIES ARE NOT TO BE AL-
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
LOWED TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN
DELEGATES AT ALL!
Minorities are to be obliterated, —de-
prived of voice, vote*and representation.
Is that the kind of Home Rule you ex
pected to get from Hoke Smith?

Yes, —A Christian Land.
So late as the reign of Queen Eliza
beth, it was a good old English custom
to spread a plentiful meal of wholesome
victuals in the hall, at the mid hour of
the day, and to throw open the door to
all who chose to enter and eat.
It was a Christian land —old England
was, and the custom honored the religion
which taught the brotherhood of man
and the fatherhood of God.
It has passed away, —this fine old cus
tom, and in its*place has come a hard
ness of heart which fills the newspapers
with paragraphs like this:
“BEG AT CHURCHES FOR WORK.
“Unemployed Men Make Pilgrimage in
Vain and One Shoots Himself.
“Special to The Washington Post.
“St. Louis, Mo., April 26.—Fifty men
knelt before various churches in Granite
City, pleading for work, and when their
pilgrimage ended in failure Christo An
toniss, a Hungarian, shot himself through
the abdomen.
“Through pouring rain and knee deep
in mud, the men, nearly all foreigners,
all bareheaded, and many without coats
and shoes, straggled from church to
church, begging for bread for their
families.”
You may read about wars, and you
may read about fire, famine and pestil
ence but it is only when you study de
tails like the above that you understand
the full horror of our modern system,—
With Christians perishing of starva
tion and despair on the steps of a mif
lion-dollar Christian church!

GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN
NOTES.
(Continued from Page One.)
first requisite to success was to know
who to kick.
No matter how this gubernatorial ru
cous may end, there is one thing that we
will stake our pet mule on, and that is
that Hoke will be mighty careful who
he kicks, the next time.
n
As to the Disfranchisement plank, let
nobody worry about that. The men who
originated it will take care of it.
Neither of the candidates now running
had anything to do with formulating that
issue, and neither can, in honor, lift a
finger against it. And when both say
that they are in favor of it we are as
ready to believe the one as the-other.
Hoke Smith and Joe Brown both rank
as gentlemen, and when both take the
pledge to the Disfranchisement plank,
that issue goes out of the campaign.
Why
Suffer?
If you suffer pain from
any cause, Dr. Miles’ Anti-
Pain Pills will relieve it
—and leave no bad after
effects. That’s the impor
tant thing. Neither do
they create a habit. More
often the attacks become
less frequent, or disappear
altogether. Dr. Miles’
Anti-Pain Pills have no
other effect except to re
lieve pain and quiet nerv
ous irritation.
"We are never without Dr. Miles*
Anti-Pain Pills. My husband and
son, aged 15 were always subject to
sick headache until we began using
these Pills, and they have broken
them up entirely. Don’t think they
have had to use them for six months.
I recommend them to every one. A
few weeks ago I heard an old lady
friend was sick. I went to see her.
She was down with TjaGrippe, and
nearly crazy with awful backache.
I gave her one of the Anti-Pain Pills
and left another for her to take Im
a short time. They helped her right
away, and she says she will never be
without them again. Last winter my
husband was taken with pluerisy on
both sides, and I know he would have
died if it hadn’t been for the Pills.
In less than half an hour he was
sweating, and went to bed and slept.’*
