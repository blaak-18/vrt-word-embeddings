Have a grass plot, not a grass
blot, in front of your house during
the season.
Cleveland threatens to suspend
the payment of the sugar boun
ty,. thereby compelling the re
cipients to go law and test the con
stitutionality of the act.
One of the main drawbacks to
any community's advancement is
the petty jealousies that are per
mitted to creep into every move
ment inaugurated for the good of all.
The public schools are being so
well appreciated in Lafayette and
is covering the parish so complete
ly that in a few years the man who
cannot read and write will be hard
to find.
Whenever local politics are allowed
to sneak in any organization that is
for the benefit of all the people of a
town, that organization is crippled
at the start, pd the chances are
favorable for Its early demise.
"Good, - substantial roads.'.- re
marks the Southern QtCti.ator, "in
any kind of weather would almost
double th.e-value of the lands
Swhich these public highways
would extend."
If Lafayette soil were cultivated
as it will be in the next twenty-five
years, or as well and generally culti
vated as some of the older western
states, its productions would sim
ply be astounding.
Natchitoches spent about S iooo
in entertaining the members of the
State press which convened in that
town last week, and will reap over
. rooo of free advertising. Could
$zooo be more profitably invested ?
Ex-Senator Ingalls frankly admits
that political activity and even office
seeking is not incompatible with the
highest political honor, and cites
President Cleveland as an example
of the active and honorable office
seeker.
Civic pride and unity of action
will build a town. Petty jealousies,
aided by the taking of snap judg
ment for the purpose of satisfying
an inordinate love of notoriety or
to satisfy a craving of spite, will
kill that town deader than Hector's
ghost.
No parish in this section has uni
formly as good lands as the parish
of Lafayette. Added to this the
fact that the farmers are rapidly
learning the new methods of agri
Culture, and the distance, therefore,
can not be far when substantial
prosperity will be attained.
Inadvertently we omitted last
week to acknowledge receipt of the
"rValley of the Teche" recently es
tablished in Breaux Bridge, and
edited by that erudite gentleman
f Mr. Chas. Delhommer. The paper
is small measured by inches, but
what it lacks in size is more than
made up in interest, especially in
its local department. We trust the
people will give it unstinted support,
per it deserves it.

CONQVENTIO,.
The following call has been
issued:
Realizing the great benefit that would be
erived by the people of our State from the
Sincoming of a desirable class of immigrants
and improved public ..roads the Business
Men's Association decided to call a Road
and Immigfation Convention, composed of
delegates from the Attakapas district, to
meet in Lafayette on Wednesday, June 14th.
The Association earnestly request and in
vite the Presidents of the different Police
Juries, the Mayors of the different towns and
cities, or the people in mass meeting to ap
point delegates to attend said convention,
and sincerely hope that the call will meet
with a hearty response from the people of
the district.
C. O. MOUTON, Pres.
A. C. ORDwAv, Sec.
Inasmuch as the Immigration
Convention held in New Orleans
has been productive of little prati
cal good, The Gazette thinks the
action of the B. M. A. in calling
this conventidn and inviting dele
gates from the adjoining parishes to
form part, is a wise move.
There can be no questioning the
fact that the crying need of South
western Louisiana is capital and a
good class of immigrants, by good
class we mean those sturdy farmers
of the Northwest who by their intel
ligence and energy have converted
a vast sea of prairie into a field
of productiveness that has enriched
so much that section.
In Southwestern Louisiana are
the most fertile lands on the face of
the globe. These lands are suscep
tible of the highest development
and their products should make
this the richest section of Louisiana.
There is room here, for many
kinds of manufactories; there is
room here for many farmers. We
want both. To secure them we
must let them know what we can
offer. And when we reach them,
they will come. It is to devise
means to reach them that this con- 1
vention is called.
But this will not be all. We
need good roads. How best to .
secure them will be discussed. And
many other things bearing on these
two germane questions will be given
attention.
Therefore the hope is entertairn -
that our sister parishles- will answer i
the inv.iation that will be sent them,
!and send representatives to help ,
further the interests of all.
PUBLIC ROADS.
Through the system of "personal" t
road service, as obtains in this sec- 1
tion much inconvenience is caused, s
and much trade is diverted from its 1
natural channels.
There can be no questioning the I
fact that should the public road be- F
tween this town and Breaux Bridge s
be, at all times, in good traveling ,
condition, it would redound greatly 1.
to the benefit of the two communi- c
nities, as well as to the farmers a
along the thoroughfare. f
It is admitted that in winter the
public road between the two points 8
is practically impassable, thereby t
creating much inconvenience, and, c
no doubt, diverting trade from its v,
rightful channel.f
The road from "Pont des Mou- I
tons," in the parish of St. Martin, s
especially that section starting from t
the bridge to a distance of about a
mile, is particularly bad, owing to t
swampy nature of the land, but be- Ir
yond this point-save in some
few places, where terraces have ,
been built with poor judgment- F
the road is, through all seasons, ii
generally in good traveling condi- c
tion, and it would not cost much t
money to put the other part in a t
lasting condition, that is, in a state q
whereby traveling, during even the
worst stage of the rainy season q
would render them passable. f
The road from the town of Lafa- fe
yctte to "Pont des Moutons" could, c
also, be put in fine condition, and f:
at a comparatively small outlay of
labor and money.
Now The Gazette believes that
this public road should receive Im
diate attention, inasmuch as this is 9
the proper time to work it, and c
would suggest that the Police Juries c
of each parish appoint a conference a
committee, whose duty it thall be
to devise means to work this road S
by the two parish joining forces. j
Let the Police Jury of the parish of t
Lafayette make a move in this di- i
rection at its next sitting, and we t
have no doubt the Police Jury of
the parish of St. Mortin will re- c
spond in a liberal spirit. t
.RDUCATION AND SUF
FRA GB.
By observing the working of the C
law in Mississippi we have become
converts to the placing of certain ~
restrictions on the right of suf
frage. The one particular restric- C
ive featite that appealed strongly
to our sense of fair play ise edu
bational one. - ?fassach tetts has ~
long afQ p't this edvcttiOPal re
striction into her State constitution.
Mississippi followed in the same
line some years since, and' it has
worked like' a charm, and now Cali
fornia proposes to follow this good
example. It i- a question of a short
time when all the other States will
adopt similar constitutional suf
frage restrictions, and nowhere is
such a law more needed than in
Louisiana. .
It may be remembered that an
ignorant suffrage-that of the dagoes
in the McEnery-Foster primary
election-came near having very
ugly results, and that there was no
trouble was due only to the cool
heads on both sides.
We might find, right here at home
an illustration of results effected by
an ignorant suffrage-hence, God
speed the day when such restrictive
measures will be adopted in every
State of the Union, and then we
may hope that the next generation
of American voters will be able to
read and write the language of the
country in which they exercise and
enjoy the right of citizenship.
SOJLE QUESTIONS.
A majority of the membership
of the incoming council elected, on
the face of the returns, at the recent
municipal election, presented them
selves before the white voters of the
corporation of Lafayette with the
following signed and published dec
laration of principles:
Our faith and steadfastness to Democratic
principles can not be questiorned, and if
elected we will administer the public affairs
of this town in a business-like manner, with
out fear or favor, or prejudice against any
one, and place the good name of the town
of Lafayette among the first in the State for
good government honestly administered.
Italic ours. The Gazette, for one,
has never doubted their loyalty to
Democratic principles. The Gazette
believes that no one has a valid rea
son to question their sincerity in the
premises, and The Gazette further
believes that their " faith and stead
fastness to Democratic principles"
are of the kind proclaimed, upheld
and defended by the fathers of-the
party..
This Democracy-as applied to
the party founded by Jefferson,
whose principles were were so firmly
upheld by Jackson, and so striking
ly examplified at home by McEnery
and Foster-the party that freed
this fair southland and squelched
the rapacious Hun that had invaded
her territory, and struck off the
shackles that held her manacled so
long in the throes of misery, and
placed her, where she stands to-day,
in the front rank of progress and
prosperity - this Democracy, in
short, means the upholding of men
and measures as declared by its ad
herants, in other words, party prin
ciples are enunciated and partisans
are selected to carry them into ef
fect.
The Gazette has heard that these
gentlemen intend to support, and by
that act elect to the position of chief
of police a gentleman holding, or
who recently held, an important of
fice through appointment by ex
President Harrison-it being an open
secret, at the time, that such posi
tions were given only to the faithful.
Now, then, the foregoing deduc
tions admitted, and suppose this ap
pointment is made, in all candor
would it not be (x) subversive of the
tenets, as well as the usages of the
party, as practiced, and (2) would
it not be violative of the profession
of faith embodied in these words of
theirs : "our faith and steadfastness
to Democratic principles cannot be
questioned"?
The Gazette has propounded these
questions as a Democratic journal,
from a party standpoint, and to its
fellows of the same professed politi
cal faith without wishing to detract
from any one his just deserts.
TIlE TRAINING OF CIliL
DREN.
So much has been written and
said about the proper training of
children, it seems almost preposter
ous for one who has no children to
advise others. But " Felix " in his
letter on "School Government"
suggests a few thoughts to me.
Sometime ago the Parish School
Board passed resolutions forbiding
the pupils to use profane language
in the public schools. At least
teachers arr expected to forbid it
and I think they should.
But here is the trouble: these
children whom teachers are expected
to teach 0good morals, have
home influences that shape their fu
ture. They hear their fathers and
big brothers cuss; they hear offi
cials cuss; they hear "*prominent"
men cuss; they hear the lower clas
ses cuss. Men cuss at home ; they
cuss on the street; they cuss in pri
rate; they cuss in public. And the
children hear them cusr.
And teachers are expected to cor
rect these evils. Cussin' is an ugly
habit. O, ye cusser, I wish you
would quit it !
One time I heard a little six-year
old girl call her an ugly name-a
name too ugly to go in print. And
I never heard the mother cJrrect
the child. - Yet she expects her lit
tle daughter to become a chaste and
lovable young woman, and marry
some nice young man.
I know a father who drinks and
gambles. But he don't want his
sons-to do so. He wants them to
be model young men.
Some parents send their darling
children to school and tell the teach
er to correct them if they need it.
But they are very careful to tell the
teacher of Bill Bully's "bad boy" or
"tom-boy" girl.
The teacher who has won the love
of his pupils, usually, can control
them. But when the neighbors are
"cross" and finding fault with each
other prevails, when long-tongued
men, and women, tongued-tied wo
men-tied in the middle and let
loose at both ends-talk and talk
and bemean and bemean each other
there trouble in the "camp" there's
but little peace in the community.
They can see their neighbor's fault
-not theio own. They talk of their
neighbor's children mischief, but
don't think theirs would be guilty of
wrong.
Go it teacher, go it! Be not des
pondent ! Guide uip thy loins, take
thy shield and staff! The people
will cuss, drink whiskey, gamble,
tattle, tell tales, "tote" pistols, and
sometimes kill each other-but
but they expect you to train their
children to be shining examples of
honor, truth, sobriety and virtue,
and place them on a plane to reach
safely that "land that's fairer than
day." Cousin Len.
