in obodience to the call of limy fel- the c
low-citizens expresstid through the It
ballot box by a majority of more thani ig,
8d00 votes, I assume the duties of sa nta.
Governor of my native State under and
circumstances of marked difficulty t vl,'
and at a period of very general dis- Pact
tress. For nine years a few men hay- are I
ing no identiiicatio. with the people
of this State, either in feeling or in
terest. have shaped and controlled
their destinies. 'lThe result of this wiiA
condition of affairs is that in spite of
rich soil, genial climate and immense
resources we find the people to-day "I
in wretched necessity and pi'Lerty. 1ulOsi
The very gifts of a benilicent Creator anot

glaring and iufthnos than that which U ni
einds to-day its baneful existence, tion
The lpeople of this State are deter- gott
rlined and I am determined this ef- test,
fort shall be foiled ; the rights and heloin
liberties of Louisiana must not he The
sitftred to be destroyed. 'l'ihee may the
be grave dillicilties, but they will be nati
overimine and hereafter upon the duly int
and legally constituted anuthoitics of wet
the State will devolve the proper ad- part
ministration of its affairs. The mate- fait:
rial prosperity of Louisiana and the arid,
hapliness of her people must be to- won
stored, and this can only be accomi- a st,
plishld by the truth and energy matni
otf her people co-operating with own

GENERAL LosNCsTIEET-This gent- it
ellrlan has declared his, conviction c:
that Geeneral Nicholls hais beenu ctl
stitutioually land Ilegally lected Gov
ernor of the State, anrd also tlihe otiher
candidates of the Dcmocatlic paIrty, a
and that the action of the RIeturning o
lIoard ras evidently fraudulent and n
1(false, and ought to bie made to Ii
vihll to the clearly ascertalined will B
of thie people. It does not appeal i
that Getneral Longstreet has 1relounc- ]
ed or changed his political relations t
to the l.epublicun partyr: t-boighl le e
lhas recently lronounIed v'ery dcci- t
sivtly ngiinst the acts and course of t
the party and its leaders in this State. I
The liutnp attemilpted to assuage the
anger of the General against Kelloggt
and Packard by hurryitg tlhrough a
bill to pay a large stIm to Longstreet I
o0i accouiiLt of militia expenses iUcur- ,
red during Kellogg's adnrinis- 1
tration. This concessiion does not
seem to have had any etftct upi,! the
c opnions of GeCn. Longstreetin c
S gard to the validity of Gen. Nicholls'
election. He tliniks that that is a
quotstion of fact, and that no party
oblingations demand or would jstilfy
his detying or opposing the same.
The loss of Longstreet in tltis crisis
to the Rumip usurpation is an irrepar
able one. He hlts been heretofore by
far tihe strongest, most stnbboru and
reliable defenudcr of Warmnotll and
ds f dKellogg in their various conflicts.
