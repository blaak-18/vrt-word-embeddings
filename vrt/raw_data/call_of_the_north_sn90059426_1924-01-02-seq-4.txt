EVIL SHOWS IN NEW YORK _
FLAUNT DECENCY'S LAWS

New York. —Although reports to
District Attorney Banton by his in
vestigators and by persons who pre
viously had complained against im
moral plays on Broadway have indi
cated that there has been a general
cleansing of the plays. Harry L.
Bowlby, secretary of the Lord’s Day
Alliance, issued a statement yester
day in which he condemned condi
tions in Jewish-managed theaters.
Mr. Bowlby said that he obtained his
information by visiting the plays in
question. He says Jews and Cath
olics stand together to protect vicious
shows opposed by Protestants.
“On Sunday, October 7, when sev
eral theaters in New York gave the
proceeds of their Sunday night show
to the earthquake sufferers in Japan,”
Mr. Bowlby said, “I personally at
tended one of the shows to see the
performance and to find out if that
performance and a number of re
vues that were given were as bad as
they had been described to me, I
found it, if possible, even worse than
described; one of the revues was
not only vile and vulgar, reeking with
profanity, but also misrepresenting
the evangelical Christian minister and
foreign missionary.
Hard to Comprehend Course
“How any self-respecting theater
could put on such a play and flaunt
such a misrepresentation into the
face of its audience is hard to un
derstand, even though many in the
audience seemed to relish such a
misrepresentation. I reported to a
representative of an outstanding mis
sionary board and discovered that
mine was not the only severe criti
cism made of the revue and the play
from which the revue was taken.
“I later visited the play from
which the revue was taken and found
it to be cne of the most disgusting
and damaging evidences against the
theater in the city, and the wonder
is that it has been allowed to live in
this great metropolis.”
It is said that there has been
strong criticism of the play from
which the missionary scene in the
revue was taken, but police investi
gators who visited it did not believe
prosecution was justified. This atti
tude of officials is arousing indigna
tion among Protestants.
Mr. Bowlby said that if a Cath
olic priest or a Jewish rabbi were
caricatured on the stage as is a
Christian missionary in the play in
question, the manager would be com
pelled to remove it. He added:
SUSPENDED SENTENCE
recently expired, but up to date Ne
gro Starks has not moved to resume
operations on his St. Clair St. lot.
State vs. Negro Starks
In December the poHponecl case
involving the charges of Hackett
against Starks came before the Court.
Kindly note that in this case it was
State vs. Turner Starks, on a charge
of “feloniously attempted to make
an assault in and upon, etc.” It is
alleged that Assistant County Attor
ney Kinkead wanted to change this
charge to “discharge of firearms
within the city limits,” but the de
termination of Mr. Hackett to get
justice prevented the change. With
the insistence of Mr. Hackett to a
charge based on his original com
plaint, Negro Starks pleaded guilty
to an “attempted” assault in the
second degree. Judge O’Brien then
gave Turner Starks a sentence of one
year in the state penitentiary. We
call your attention to the fact that
this sentence was then suspended by
Judge O’Brien. It would seem strange
that the Negro porter who was in
Starks’ barber shop at the time of
the alleged assault was not called
as a witness for the defense. The
arresting officers weye not called by
the state, nor the officer who took
the bullet from the automobile in
volved in the case. It is alleged that
Negro Starks told the Court that he
was using blank cartridges and at
tempted to frighten Fredrickson, et
ai. In his plea of guilt, Negro Starks
made various statements. The
Court, after the defendant’s plea,
turned to Assistant County Attorney
Kinkead and asked if he defendant’s
statements were correct. Kinkead
is alleged to have answered that the
statements were generally correct.
The word “generally” would
seem to cover a world of territory
and is so lacking in definiteness as to
be ridiculous. At this time it might
be well to note a point that, if it is
not peculiar, is ridiculous. -During a
call upon Assisant County Attorney
Kinkead, he remarked that Starks’
sentence was suspended at the time
of his plea of guilt on December 3
because Probation Officer Zolle, it is
alleged, was not yet ready with his
report, which, however, is alleged to
have been used in Starks’ behalf. It
would appear that Probation Officer
Zolle was preparing his report for
the alleged defense of Starks, prior
to Starks’ plea of guilt.
“In my judgment, the play should
receive a like fate from an aroused
and organized evangelical Christi
anity in Greater New York, and I be
lieve the hour has come for a reck
oning.”
Charity organizations which are in
part supported by the churches, Mr.
Bowlby said, should be careful not
to accept aid from theater managers
who are violating the law. He said
that a number of shows given on
Sunday are making money under the
subterfuge of charity.
Young Protests
The Rev. S. Edward Young, pas
tor of the Bedford Presbyterian
church, Brooklyn, condemned two
shows today in a letter which he sent
to Mr. Banton and also had pub
lished in a newspaper.
Immoral and indecent German and
Austrian films are being furnished
to lower East Side theaters and stag
parties, according to information re
ceived by the office of the attorney
general. After the war, according to
Maurice H. Gotlieb, deputy attorney
general, German and Austrian pro
ducers specialized in indecent films
to please a jaded public. Now these
films are a drug on the market in
Europe and there is an attempt to
unload them here.
Six men have been prosecuted for
handling foreign films which were in
decent, encouraged crime, or had a
bad influence on children, according
to Mr. Gotlieb. Max Kleinman,
president of the Exhibitors Film Ex
change of 130 West 46th street, was
arrested for selling two alleged in
decent Austrian films to Joe Bevala
cuer, owner of the Novelty theater
at 214 Bowery. Bevalacuer pleaded
guilty in Special Sessions. He said
he was not familiar with the law and
promised to turn state’s evidence
against Kleinman. He will testify at
Kleinman’s trial on December 17.

Ku Klux Klan Had Nothing to Do
With Affair
The Ku Klux Klan, of course, had
nothing -to do with the affair and it
was absurd for Negro Starks to in
ject the Klan into the matter at all.
It would seem to us that the Negro
injected the Ku Klux Klan into the
case, thinking that it might help him
personally somewhat by creating at
titude of minds which would favor
him. We don’t think that the Court
paid any attention to the statements
of Starks’ involving the Ku Klux
Klan. Negro Starks pleaded guilty
and was sentenced by the Court.
You have already the decision of the
Court. Would suggest that you' go
back and re-read the part of the ar
ticle where we touched on this point.
According to Minnesota Statutes,
Section 5057, a barber’s certificate
may be revoked upon conviction for
any crime. It would seem it was in
order to call for a revocation of Tur
ner Starks’ certificate.
Section 8631, Minnesota Statutes,
states, under “assault in the first de
gree,” “Every person who, with in
tent to kill a human being, or to com
mit a felony upon the person or the
property of one assaulted, or of an
other, shall assault another, with a
loaded firearm, or any other deadly
weapon or by any force or means
likely to produce death, shall be
guilty of assault in the first degree
and punished by imprisonment in a
state penitentiary for not less than
five years nor more than ten years.”
The question naturally arose in our
mind as to whether Starks had com
mitted an assault and we find in
Bouvir’s Law Dictionary, A to E,
“Any act causing well founded appre
hension of immediate peril from a
force already partially or fully put
in motion is an assault.” Upon look
ing up a case wherein a man had
struck a horse driven by another,
causing the horse to run away and
bringing about the injury of the driv
er, the man who struck the animal
was found guilty of assault. In
Volume 5, Corpus Jurus, Page 615, it
gives the following definition of as
sault, “Any intentional, unlawful of
fer of corporal injury to another by
force, or force unlawfully directed
toward the person of another, under
such circumstances as create. a well
founded fear of imminent peril,
coupled with the apparent present
ability to effectuate the attempt, if
not prevented, constitute an assault.”
As you go over the details of the
f A Facsimile Of A Letter —And Some
Dates To Be Remembered
On August 14, 1923, J. C. Walton, then Governor of Oklahoma, declared war on the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
repudiated his affiliations with the Organization and issued his famous order to the citizens of Oklahoma, directed
at Klansmen, “Shoot to kill, I will pardon you.” Note the date, August 14, 1923, for that date marked the be
ginning of one of the most dastardly attempts to wreck the Organization ever undertaken and was the beginning
of a reign of terror in the sovereign state of Oklahoma, precipitated by a person who had already been denounced
by the Klan and who has since been impeached and indicted by the people of Oklahoma for malfeasance in office.
Klansmen are familiar with the bloody reign of “Iron Jack” Walton, which began openly August 14, 1923.
Now, pay particular attention to the date of the above letter. Nuff sed.
case many thoughts arise in your
mind and you begin to wonder about
many things. Our purpose in telling
you the details is to arouse the
thinking people of St. Paul, the state,
and the nation, to the point where
they will take a keener interest in
all matters pertaining to the welfare
of any community of the state and
the nation. Of course, some will
think that the Call of the North
seeking to persecute Negro Starks
because of the color of his skin.
Nothing could be farther from the
truth than such a thought. We seek
a square deal for all people and we
want laws enforced without fear and
without favor. One way to get bet
ter enforcement of laws is to pre
sent various matters directly to the
people so that they may go over in
their minds the details connected
therewith and finally come to definite
conclusions based on facts and a 3 a
result of considerable meditation.
Groveland Park Folks Within Rights
If Den E. Lane had not sold the lot
on St. Clair St. to Turner Starks, the
unpleasantness in the Groveland Park
district would have been avoided. It
is natural to expect that the people
of Groveland Park want to keep the
residential districts free from com
mercial buildings, wherever such
buildings lower the property value of
their residential holdings and • de
crease the desirableness of any par
ticular block. Some people seem to
think that various real estate deal
ers have been seeking to make of St.
Clair St. another Rice St. and there
fore wished to force their way
tftrough the opposition which comes
from individuals owning dwelling
houses on this street. Whether Den
E. Lane was seeking to turn St.
Clair St. into another Rice St. is not
known, yet it is beyond our under
standing why he should sell the lot
on St. Clair St., very nearly in the
middle of a residential block, nearly
directly across the street from a
beautiful public school to Turner
Starks. It would have made no dif
ference to the people of Groveland
Park whether Turner Starks were
white or black, they are opposed to
a barber shop directly in a residential
district and would have taken ac
tions similar to those which they
have taken, had Turner Starks been
a white man. Some contend that va
rious business men of the Groveland
Park district did not oppose the erec
tion of the barber shop, but the only
business man that we can find who

Waco, Tex. Mike H. Thomas,
Grand Master Mason of Texas, said
in his annual report to the eighty
eighth annual meeting of that organ

“In all cases of this kind that have

have adopted the position always
that as one individual is entitled to
disagree with the Klan, so was an
other privileged to agree with it, and
vice versa; that discussions of the
subject had no place in Masonry;
that Masonry had no right to con
demn it or accept it any more than
it would some other fraternal order,
religious sect or political party, un
til proven in the courts of the United
States that it was immoral; and that
it was equally un-Masonic to use Ma
sonry to tear this or any other or

to build another order up.” ,

stated that a man in business could

' a Traitor to U. S.
—K-K-K
“The impeachment of Governor J.
C. Walton of Oklahoma, is of more
than local interest. No man in any
English-speaking community, since
probably the time of James the
Second, ever defied the people, tram
pled upon the Constitution and at
tempted tn rule in such an autocratic
fashion as did Governor Walton.
Someone was killed and Governor
Walton immediately, without reason,
charge or trial, blamed the Ku Klux
Klan, and called out the militia to
fight that organization to the death.
He was at once hailed by the Ro
manist and pro-Romanist press as
the man of the hour—just the kind
of a man needed to rid the Ameri
can Republic of the hated K. K. K.
The Klan is still going strong and
Walton has lost the governorship.
He was deposed from office because
he took advantage of weaknesses in
the United States Constitution, de
clared war on an organization with
out justificaion, and violated his oath
of office. Even if the Ku Klux Klan
were half as bad as they are painted
by the Roman press, and they are not,
they would be as saints compared
with the erstwhile idol of the Knights
of Columbus, J. C. Walton, who con
ducted himself as the star criminal
of Oklahoma.

Says Military Court at Tulsa Did
Not Develop One Single Case
Against Klan As Charged
By Gov. Walton
—K-K-K
Oklahoma City.—Former Gov. J. C.
Walton’s spectacular military ac
tivity in Oklahoma was wholly un
necessary, for there was nothing to
indicate the existence of “riot and in
surrection/' which, in his various
proclamations of martial law by
which he attempted to combat these
conditions, the executive had attrib
uted to mob violence, directed and
executed by the Ku Klux Klan.
Such is the substance of testi
mony given to a legislative investi
gating committee by Adjutant Gen
eral Baird H. Markham who com
manded Oklahoma National Guard
troops enforcing the governor’s mili
tary edicts. The testimony which
was made public by the committee
was a direct expression from the ad
jutant general, who recently was
warmly commended by the legisla
ture for his conduct during the pe
riod of martial law.
Didn’t Involve Klan
Walton’s oft-reiterated charges
that practically every act of violence
in Tulsa county could be traced to
the Klan were not supported by evi
dence, Adjutant General Markham
said, for out of the approximately
100 cases of flogging investigated by
the military courts at Tulsa, the
Klan was found to have been direct
ly involved in only one, that one be
ing at Broken Arrow, Okla. In that
instance the Klan’s charter was im
mediately revoked.
Force of arms was never needed in
Tulsa county; only the power and
process to bring witnesses before the
military court were necessary in the
investigation there, according to Ad
jutant General Markham. The same
was true in Okmulgee county, the
first section of the state to feel mili
tary rule. There, the adjutant gen
eral declared, the militory found that
a deputy sheriff had abused his au
thority, but there was no trace of
the riot and insurrection which Wal
ton declared held sway.
It likewise was the case in Okla
homa county (Oklahoma City) where
the adjutant general said conditions
were entirely normal.
Muskogee Spared
Walton, the witness told the com
mittee, was determined to invoke ab
solute martial law in another county
at the same time the Oklahoma coun
ty decree became effective, and at
first had decided on Muskogee coun
ty, but Markham said he informed
the executive his investigations had
reported no occasion for such action
there and persuaded the governor to
alter his decision. Accordingly Wal
ton was said to have made the order
applicable to Creek instead of Mus
kogee county.
The adjutant general described
this act as an attempt by Walton to
“cover up,” or justify martial law
here.
