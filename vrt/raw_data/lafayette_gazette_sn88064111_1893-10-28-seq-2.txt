Litigants.
The Umanagmeat of The Gazette desires to call

tersl to tte exceptional advantages oaered by
this payer for the publication of their notices of sales
etc. he Ilarge Cftctshltioh of the paper, and its in
creasing popularity in Lafayette and parish is a suf
scient guaranty to advertisers that business entrus
fed to The Gazette will reach a larger circle than can
be Accomplished through any other medium.
"George Washington
Was not a publisher and there
fore had no provocation to "ro
mance" about something that,
as far as he was concerned,had
no existence. But history and
tradition agree that Washing
ton could not tell a lie, and
just here the marked difference
between him and"
The Gazette
Become strikingly apparent;
the former lived for something
he could not do, and the latter
for something it could but
would not do-because it has
not been necessary ; the truth
about the circulation of The
Gazette is that it circulates all
over the parish, being without
a serious rival in this respect,
and that is large enough
Por the Present.
Books open to inspection
of prospective advertisers.
MUST EXTEND HELP.
The Board of Trade of New Ibe
ria have a standing offer to donate
three sites, and eight miles of
graded road bed for narrow guage
railroad to any one that will erect a
central refinery in or near that town
and the mill and appurtenances will
be exempt from taxation for Io
years. After reading this offer The
Gazette has often recalled the pro
position, made indirectly it is true,
to the effect that if the people of
the town of Lafayette would donate
a site and take a few thousand dol
lars of stock, a refinery would be
erected in the neighborhood.
The people know (only, we are
pained to say, seem indifferent) that
if they want industries they must
not only take "a move on them
selves," but must go down in their
pockets and pull out a few dollars,
whereby to extend such induce
ments that will make possible these
industries.
It is a mighty poor policy to rest
on our oars until some one hails us.
Capital now-a-days is not running
around the country, knocking at
every town's door, so to speak, to t
find out if there are opportunities
existing for the investment of mon- t
ey. Capital must be courted, and
approached in the manner of the
country Arkansan, who had a city I
chap for a rival, and saw the abso
lute necessity of doing some "tall l
courting." He married the girl. t
As we said, the people are fully
cognizant of the situation, and of
the means that should be employed
to "get the girl," but somehow or I
another. take no step. Carencro,
from all ittlications, propose to
emulate the Arkansas chap. Breaux
Brfdge has dtione so, and the arm is
around the "fair form." Now un
less Lafayette wakes up to her op
portunities, and that yery soon, she
will be in a position to exclaim :
"Where am I at ?" t
TlIE CITY PLrBLIC SCIhOOL.
The Lafayette public school un- C
der the management of Prof. R. C. s
Greig, principal, and Miss Maggie
Jamieson, assistant, has been in op- t
eration just two mnonths, yet it is
now taxed to its utmost capacity by
the number of pupils In attendance. t
The register this month shows an
enrollment of 55 boys and -5 girls,
making a total of 80 pupils enrolled. 1
While this does not represent the c
maximum enrollment attained by s
the school, it is sufficient to tax not
onl~y tlie capacfty of a single room,
45 x 30 feet, but the united energies I s
of the two zealous and painstaking1
teachers. The average attendance '
this fall has been much higher, and
exhibits a marked improvement over 1
the records of past terms. This may
be taken as indicating an increased I
faterest on the parts of parents and I
pu;-a as well as evidencing the sti
milus Ssparted by the agitation of -
the High School question. The
school is in healthy and active
growth, many of the pupils mani
#is g pecnliar interest in their va
rious studies. Progress seems the
watchword of the institution.
UP GRADE.
The people of Breaux Bridge are
justly jubilant, and look with bright
anticipation on the roseate future
that appears cleat to their vision.
And it is not a dream, either. The
substance is there. It came in the
person of Mr. Knapp, an enterpris
ing man controlling vast capital.
He looked over the country and
saw a promise of ample returns for
whatever investment he should de
cide to make. He is the owner of
a magnificently equipped refinery
situated some miles above Breaux
Bridge, and now sees that one mill
cannot begin to manufacture the
raw material that will offer in the
next two years. Therefore another
is needed. But where shall it be si
tuated ? Near the edge of the town
of Breaux Bridge would be a good
location. This statement was im
parted to the people of that town.
Promptly they donated the site,
some twelve acres, and the result
will soon be seen in the erection of
a refinery of large capacity. This
of itself will be worth thousands of
dollars to the people of the town
and neighborhood. But this is not
all. There must be quick transpor
tation facilities for the product of
the mill to reach the open market.
That, also, will be forthcoming.
Presently Mr. Knapp is having con
structed a narrow guage railroad
from Carencro to the Huron planta
tion, and will extend the road to
Breaux Bridge.
There are other industries in view
but this enough to give that section
an impetus on the road to prosper
ity as she has, perhaps, never
dreamed of before.
The Gazette is most happy to
note the bright lining in the silver
clouds, and congratulate the people
on the fact that the richness of their
undeveloped resources are at last
recognized and will be at an early
day utilized to the profit of all.
LO ! TIE POOR TRAMP.
The opportunity was" offered The
Gazette to note the manner in whichl
those pariahs, - " tramps " - are
made to work out a sentence inflict
ed by the authorities under the va
grant law.
They perform the laborious task of
handling a spade or shovel of hoe,
digging, shoveling and leveling the
dirt on the streets.
They are given two meals a day,
one at 9 o'clock a. m., and one at
2 o'clock p. m. Two o'clock in
the evening to 9 o'clock next morn
Ing-t9 hours without f od.
When it is taken into considera
tion that most of these '"tourists"
are unused to hard labor ; that they
are in the habit-the most of them
-of munching food several times a
day, one can then feel what must be
their bodily fatigues and the gnaw
ing pangs of hunger, when Night
throws her mantle over Mother
Earth.
And for what crime are these peo
ple condemned to labor so hard?
Tramps / Did they commit a
breach of the peace of such a na
ture as to deserve such punish
ment ? Oh, yes ! they are tramps.'
Let us admit that the majority are
bad at heart and only want an op
portunity to demonstrate it ? But
surely all are not bad. Some of
them must be only in hard luck.
Would it not be following the Mas
ter's teaching to allow 99 bad ones,
especially when no serious breach
of the peace has been committed, to
go,rather than one, whose only fault
may be that' misfortune has over
taken him, should be made to suf
fer ?
In seeing them labor for two days 1
on the street in which our office is
situated, we frankly confess that
our sympathies went to them in
their apparent misery.
The Gazette presents a plea for
a mitigation of their hours of labor,
three meals a day, and when the -
sentence expires, they be given
-5 cents for every day they have
worked upon the streets. We be
lieve they have earned it, and feel
confident the general public will
say they deserve it.
Now, kind reader, when ready'
to look upon the "tramp" as
some soulless wretch that deserves
severe punishment for being a tramp,
let your condemation be tempered
with mercy, for
Mercy * * * I
" Is an attribute to God himself.
And worthy power dost then show like God's
When mercy seasons justice.
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,- t
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation : we do pray for mercy; 1
And the same prayer doth teach us all to
render
The deeds of mercy."
QUICK CITIZENSIP. I
A New York paper reports that a
judg in that citv can manufacture
voters at least as fast as any official
in the country. One day, recently,
he naturalized twenty aliens in. sev
en minutes, and did not act, so the
report avers, as -if he thought he
was doing something extraordinary.
The applicants were asked hardly a
question, and were sworn together
in bunches.
It is men like this New York
judge that are turning the citizen
making process in a farce.. What
respect for our suffrage laws can
the average foreigner have who is
thus mechanically converted into a
voter P What sort of impression
does such haste make upon the
young American who has been
taught to regard citizenship as a
high privilege ? Does any one think
we can continue to pollute the
stream of suffrage without suffering?
It may bring on serious results in
the future. It came near so two
years ago in New Orleans, when the
dagoes were voted, en masse, for
one faction.
It may be safely presumed that
not a few officials elscwhMre have
been doing the same thing, but, per
haps, not on such a large scale, and
it is high time for some check to be
set. The more that citizenship is
cheapened, the more difficult it be
comes to preserve the ballot-box
from corruption and to secure the
election of capable and honest men.
If not stopped it will eventually lead
to anarchy or imperialism.
Power of Simple Eloquence.
The little court house was packed. Look
ing out of its many paned windows across
the dusty square, one could see the atmos
phere quivering under the August. sun.
There was scarcely a breath of breeze. It
was an air and sky under which racers, ner
vous animals, break records. Coupled with
that atmosperic condition there was that in
,describable nervous tension apparent in the
crowd that betokens intensest interest in
some human concern. The young prisoner
was on trial for his life. The evidence had
all been heard. The State's attorney had
just taken his seat after a most incisive state
ment of the evidence wherein he had de
monstrated the utter failure of the prisoner's
theory of self-defense. The prisoner was a
stranger in the county. The deceased had
long resided there, though few knew him,
and many shrugged their shoulders when
he and his were mentioned, for their repu
tation was not of the best, though no one
could point to any particular act. T''he
counsel for the prisoner was a stranger too,
known only by reputation to the judge and
the bar, and that reputation was one of great
ability, perfect integrity, and and a marve
lous knack of "'snatching verdicts" each
time by some new turn. This gaunt, yet
g-accful grayheaded man arose, seemingly
without looking at the jury,though each man
felt he was under th.- power of that wide
open gray eye. After bowing to the judge
and saying a few almost inaudible words of
courtesy to his honor, he turned to the pris
oner and said: "You must die, John-die
by hanging. It will be for no fault of yours,
by no fault of the judge or of his jury, or of
the good people of the country: neither will
it be any fault of the law. The law of Tex
as is all right, though you die innocent. The
law. though its machinery may sometimes
expose perjury, can't always prevent the
false swearing Df witnesses. Judges and
juries have not the power, though they some
times exercise the authority, of Almighty
God. They couldn't look down into the
souls of these perjured witnesses and see the
malice, hate and private purpose that color
ed and twisted all the facts. We can't help
it now. You must die as you have lived,
like a brave man. I don't need to tell you
that. The woman who bore you, three
months before you saw the light of heaven,
carried in her arms from one of the blood
iest fields of the late war, the bleeding,
senseless form of your father, while shot and
shell still shrieked and the groans of the dy
ing tilled the air. And your father, whose
maimed body we laid to rest last week, was
not matched in all this land. These trusted
you, and their blood can betray no trust.
The only message he sent you was, 'Tell
him we believe in him.' We will lay you
hbeside them. In a few days this old white
head will be laid next to you. I'll not be
ashamed to be buried soon beside you, John.
You are so like the other John, that I see
visions of happy boyhood while gazing into
the same true eyes-confused with these is
the pride, I've taken in my friend's
boy. While we lay these bodies in the
church yard over the mountain we'll appeal
this case. We'll try it all over again up
yonder." Then in a few of the boldest and
grandest figures he sketched his idea of a
trial in Ileaven, where, as he said, " In that
glorious presence false witness is dumb, and
the Inerrant Judge needs not the aid of coun
sel or of juries." Then he pictured in low,
vibrating tones the eagerness with which
the mother, and the calm confidence with
which the father, awaited in Heaven's ver
dict, the quick rush, the entrancing, soul
satisfying embrace of both at the woods
"not guilty." Then, taking up both hands
of the prisoner, he looked down in his face,
for a moment steadily, then, bending for
ward, with mother-like tenderness, kissed
him twice on the forehead, saying, in a whis
per audible to all, "'We can wait for that ?
So, good bye. John, my boy." Bowing res- ;
pectfully again to the judge, he took his seat
still holding one of the prisoner's hands.
The district attorney, who through all this
sat with back half turned to the speaker and
to the jury, nervously and excitedly chewing
his toothpick and crossing and recrossed his
legs, began a reply which quickly ended,
after a good look at the juror's faces, in a
stammering request to them to do their duty.
The judge's charge was scattering. He
seemed to scarcely know what he said. The;
jury did not hear him. Not the slightest
incident occurred to break the spell. They
went out, returned, and in verv few mm- ,I
meats the verdict of ",not guilty" was re
corded. What was the force tlhat -"worked"
this result ?
The N w Police Juror.
To the Editor of the Lafayette Gazette:
By the daily papers I see that Governor
Foster has appointed Mr. Alfred Hebert as
police juror from the 3rd ward vice W. B.
pect has proved an able and efficient mem
ber of the jury, serving in the capacity of
president for one year, with marked ability
and it would not be exaggerating tosay that no
member of that body has displayed morecom
mendable zeal in the discharge of his official
duties. The resignation of Mr. Torian was
a surprise to all and will be regretted by his
many friends. The appointment by the gov
ernor of Mr. Hebert to fill the vacancy will
doubtlesss give general satifaction as that
gentleman is well known for his energetic
business quaillities as well as his sterling
worth and Yntelligence. If past record forms
any basis for judging the future. Mr. He
bert's appointment will certainly redound to
the welfare of the parish in the interest of
which he will, with characteristic zeal, di
rect all his energies. Yet while all this is ad
mitted, I must contend that though the gov
ernor could hardly have selected a better
qnalified person, the appointment, all things
beiing equal, should have been made from
the parish proper and not from the corpora
tion of Lafayette. The office is one of
strictly parochial nature and represents the
parish interests in contradiction to those of
the municipality. While there may be no
constitutional impediments debarring a citizen
of an in. orpo ,tted town from exercising the
functions ux t me office in question, still it
cannot be gainsaid that in the very nature of
the case, it most'cerfqinly and properly be
longs to the peopile . the pariah proper. It
is a fact that such appointments have been
made heretofore, and the wisdom of such
selections so far as the mierits and qualifica
tions of the appointees are concerned, and
the beneficial results derived therefrom,form
no part of the principle involved. The ap
pointee it may be argued has extensive farm
ing interests in the parish, and, therefore,
may justly fill the office as representing the
parish. This I contend does not affect the
position I maintain The parochial and mu
nicipal interests are not always identical,
and sometimes are very conflicting, as for
icstance just at the present juncture.
Now, Mr. Editor, let no one take offence
as all 1 have said may npt be worthy of any
consideration, and has been jmttcd down in
kiadest spirit. Mr. Hebert is a warnm per
sonal friend of time, and the next time I
meet him I shall certainly give him a grip of
the "horny hand of a workingman," and
congratulate him upon his well merited ap
pointment. VERITAS.

COLUMBIA RICE MILL
NEW YORK,
We beg to call attention to the
fact that we have commenced mill
ing for the new season. Planters
who propose shipping rough rice
to be milled on toll-will do well to
write us as to the amount they are
likely to ship and the probable date
of shipment. This will enable us to
place same on our mill roster and
by the turn being thus engaged, im
mediate attention secured as soon
as the rough is received.
Holders of old crop will do well
to send it right along before the new
crop makes it "take a back seat."
Do not mix the old and new to
gether as they mill differently and
they both suffer.
Care should be taken to pack in
good strong bags, also to mark
plainly that lots may not get m.xed
with others coming to us by each
incoming steamer.
