HE LOST HIS MOLD)
H\ID) THIIRTR Y-FIVE HUNDRED
DOLLARS IN HIS BAG.
Ite Played With Sharks and Has the
Experience.-Adams XVill Know
Better the Next Time.
On Monday afternoon a so-called
farmer named C. B. Adams was re
lieved of his hand traveling satchel or
bag in which there was over $3000 in
gold twenty-dollar gold pieces. The
story could be lengthened into columns
but the facts abbreviated are:
Adams is from Center, Tex. He has
been in Shreveport several days. He is
not of the unsophisticated kind. He is
not what could be styled a festive coun
try jay. At any rate, he negotiated on
tionday morning at the Commercial
National Bank certificates payable at
Center, Tex.. aggregating $3500. He
demanded gold and gold wat paid over
to him. excepting a few dollars in cur
rency which he placed in his bag. He
was advised to leave the money on de
posit or to have it expressed to Center.
Tex., but he wanted no safeguards; he
could take care of his money; no one
could rob him or take it away from him.
He left the hank with his gold, going,
he said, to catch the train at the Hous
ton and Shreveport depot. It was about
to a.m. and the passenger train was
gone: in fact there was no train to
take. Adams returned to Curlee's sal
oon on Texas avenue near Jordan st eet
where he had slept Sunday night, and
there he met J. \V. McNeal, who until
recently was employed as a detective by
the Kansas City Southern. He was
warmly greeted by McNeal, with whom
fte took a drink, in fact several drinks.
A little game was proposed, but McNeal
said he could not play as he had no
money but was willing to do his best if
Adams would stake him. Adams lest;
ill the money in his pocket was gone.
He pawned or sold his pistol and this
amount, $ro. was soon out of his reach.
It was then that he .rose from his seat
at the card table and with his bag re
tired a short distance and galled Mc
Neal to him and to whom he displayed
his gold. Having taken several gold
pieces from the bag, he resumed his seat
at the card table and lost. He retired a
second time and Gus Strickland was
with him at the second opening of the
bag for more gold. Adams pulled out a
handful of twenty-dollar gold pieces,
put them in his pocket, closed the bag.
which he placed at his feet tinder the
card table and resumed the play. In a
little while he felt for his bag; it was
gone. Then the cry of alarm was raised.
It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
On being advised of the robbery, Chief
Jones hastened to the scene on horse
back. He was soon joined by Deputies
Ward and Worsham. On his way to
Curlee's, Chief Jones urged several po
licemen to meet him at the saloon where
they "pulled" J. W. McNeal, Al Morri
son alias Sharkey, D. P. Corpie- and
Gus Strickland, against whom there is
an indictment for robbing a man named
Hamilton in St. Paul bottom. Instead of
gold the police secured the empty bag
which had held Adams'. money, which
he would not leave at the bank or have
expressed, aad which he -alone could
keep safe and secure, etc. There can be
no pity or sympathy for such a man,
but in the name of law and order it is
to "be hoped that the men who have
robbed Adams of his gold will be con
victed and sent to the pen.
REV. DR. PARKIIURST.
He Joins the Negropholists in Denun
ciation of the South.
The indignation aroused by the in
flammatory harangue in Washington,
D. C., recently by the negro, Hayes, has
scarcely been . lulled when the negro
question is again revived by Rev. Dr.
Parkhurst, who has joined the negroph
olists in denunciation of the South. In
his announcements from his pulpit last
Stnday he stated that "the Wednesday
evening prayer meeting there would be
an address by the Rev. W.. H. Mitchell,
a missionary of the Freedmen's Board,
in South Carolina. Booker T. Washing
t~n has informed Dr. Parkhurst that
the Rev. Mr. Mitchell is a reliable man.
In making the announcement Dr. Park
hurst said: 'Even at this day, so lont
after the proclamation of emancipation,
there is, in many parts of the South, a
condition of veritable slavery. Although
we claim to be a civilized people, there
is a degree of barbarism in our treat
ment of- the black race that is not ex
ceeded in any part of the world. And,
ate , we send out missionaries to
Si a e or lands there are corn

whii «r., in txc clutch.\ s insation fol
lowed naturally and after church Rev.
Dr. Parkhurst ne the Southern gentle
moan, who was in waiting to meet him,
who tried to disabuse the mind of this
minister, who, however. would not be
convinced against his ill. The abuse and
h, villikatinn of the South by the
negro-laiwvyr, 1aies, is not surprising.
but it is shocking to think that a man
'viho towers in intellect and information,
one who is presumed to be a teacher and
a leader. an example for others to fol
'ow, should have descended to the level
if a negro tirehrani in his denunciation
If the South. But why waste space or
time on a mar who, as a minister. stands
as a false pretente, a great misfit who
may draw. if not too deep dyxd in cus
sedness and prejudice, some informa
tion from the rcmnirks of Bishop Smith,
an able negro divine of New Orleans.
who after condemning in unmeasured
words the incendiary ravings of the
tegrotlawyer. Haves, and at the same
tife disapproving the policy of Presi
lent Roosevelt as to the negro. said:
"It is uniulst and cruel to hold the
masses of the negroes responsible for
the ravings of dhe negro attorney,
Hayes. We are no more responsible for
his cranky utterances than are the entire
white people it this country for the ray
ings of Herr Most and Emma Goldman.
"The American negro has not yet pro
luced a pronounced anarchist or revolu
Littiist. Hle believes in the supremacy of
the law.g and obedience to the powers
that be. Whenever the negro has lifted
tp the sword it has not been against the
Country, but for it. The American negro
is the best ally that the white man has.
He alone has accepted, in so far as he
has been able to understand it, cheer
fully and in toto, -the white man's civ
iization and religion.
"We ask that oor whole people he not
made to stiffer for the sins of an indi
vidual. if the President of the United
States has erred, let those who say so
wring him to accoont without involving
either or indirectly the innocent millions
of my people. Wr have not petitioned
the President to invite any one to his
public functions or to his private table.
With that we haver noting to do. We are
satisfied to dwell 1a-eurxown homes, eat

society.
"In closing I am pleased to emphasize
ihat even tie new South has no need
to fear the negro, whether old or young.
will resort to wholesale deeds of vio
lence to avenge either fancied or real
wrongs.
"Now, as in the past, we submit our
cause to the arbitration of an eternal
and just God, and to the Christian con=
science and sense of justice of the intel
ligent and dominant people of the
South."
The contrast between the utterances
of the eminent divine of New Yotk and
his no less distinguished colored broth
er of New Orleans is striking. The
words of Dr. Parkhurst breathe of hell
ish prejudice and hatred. The words of
Bishop Smith are dictated by a spirit of
conciliation and of brotherly love, a
Christian spirit which leaves a gladden
ing impress on the mind and heart. Well
may Bishop Smith plead for pea-e, for
right against such anarchistic utterances
of the reverend gentleman of Neiv York
who with his negro lawyer co-lahorer,
Hayes, would incite riot and bloodshed.
Indeed, the contrast is marked. One a
pleader of so-called religion, a man
who has been feted and feasted, who
has become so inflated in his own im
portance that when he alludes to the
South, even from his pulpit, he will
fully, if not willfully and maliciously,
ignorantly misrepresents the South, and
against such a man what greater crime
could be charged than ignorance of
facts-the facts which concerns a part
of his own country? But Dr. Parkhurst,
and there are others throughout the
North, are pandering to prejudice and
sectionalism, while Bishop Smith, a ne
gro, as an earnest minister, enlisted in
the service of his God, with no ambi
tion, desire or inclination of pandering
to the select in a grand-stand play, is
moved to speak patriotic words, the
words of love and peace, the words
which must win friends for himself and
his race. Bishop Smith understands, the
negro, and he knows that the negro can
have no better friend than the Southern
white man. It is a pity that Dr. Park
hurst is an eminent divine, at least in
name, and it is a pity that he will not
lay aside his ministerial cassock for the
less striking perhaps but no less effective
garb of the pot-house politician and ne
gropholist Hayes. There can be only
contempt for such words from Dr.
Parkhurst as are denunciatory of the
South without warrant and the fullest
i praise must be given to the lovu flul,
peaceful utterances of Bishop Smith, a
negro; a negro it is tr - b W, the l'."
MHE POTTS CASE.
Supreme Court Decisions c4 local
Interest.
At its session held in New *rfeans
Monday opinions by the Supreme Court
were rendered in a number of cases of
which several are of local interest. For
instance the Potts case. It will he re
called that the husband of the plaintiff
was killed on August r. 190., with his
co-worker. Whitworth, on Texas ave
nue while stringing wires for the Cum
herlanil Telephone Company which
wires camne in contact with thte span
wire supporting the trolley wire of the
Shreveport Railway Company. The
widow, Mrs. Potts, brought suit against
the Shreveport Belt Railway Company
for $25,00o damages. The jury rendered
a verdict for $5000. The case was ap
pealed by the Belt Railway Company.
The syllabus of the Supreme Court's
decision is as follows
Mrs. Birdie Potts vs. Airevepor IclVt
Railway Company-i. It is not of itself
contributory negligence h engage in a
dangerous occupation. 2. Wen a per
con is employed in the presence. of a
known danger, to constitute contribu
tory negligence it must be shown that
he voluntarily and unnecessarily ex
posed himself to the danger. 3. A com
pany maintaining electrical wires over
which a high voltage of electricity is
conveyed, rendering them highly dan
gerbus, is tinder the duty of using the
necessary care and prudence at places
where others have the right to go, to
prevent injury. It must see to it that
is wires are perfectly insulated and
kept so,'- else it must provide adequate
guard wires or other sufficient safety
appliances -as means of protection'
against the dangerous wires. 4. The fact
that frequent inspections of the line
were made to ascertain the condition of
the wires and to remedy the defective
insulation does not relieve the company
tf liahility. If the span wire had be
come dangerously charged with the
electrical current, the company's inspec
tion should have been thorough enough
to have detected it. It is the company's
business to know the dangerous defects
in or along its lines, and, knowing, to
safeguard the same. Judgment affirmed.
The Whitworth case is still pending
and when reached to a finality will be
as in the Potts decision.
Another case of local interest is:
Houston and Shreveport Railway Co.
vs. Kansas City, Shreveport and Gulf
Railway Co.-Appeal from the First
Di trict, Parish of Caddo-i. A reason
:_)c and practicable crossing will not
be denied if it be in the interest of the
public that it he granted. 2. Although
there is no statute regulating the ex
propriation of a crossing of one railroad
by another, the general statute upon the
subject will afford the right to obtain
crossing, when the business of the road
and of the public are in need of a new
depot. 3. Rights of way are acquired
snoorolnately to the public's right to
other roads. The test is necessity and
public interest. The right of the road at
the place selected will not be more ma
terially impaired than it would be if
another place fo rthe crossing be select
ed. 4. Safeguards and protection at
crossings are highly important. They
should be general., and not be limited to
one crossing. The right to require inter
locking devices and other safety appli
ances is left open for consideration in
proceedings if instituted to that end.
;. The jury of the vicinage are pecu
liarly competent to judge of the neces
sity of allowing one railroad to cross
the line of another at a particular place
and to assess the amount to be paid
there for. ,Unless their finding is mani
festly erroneous it will not be disturbed.
Subject to reserved rights, as re
'tes to srfety appliances, the jury's ver
dict an dthe court's judgment are af
firmed at appellee's costs.
Fiorshlcio Bros. Dry Goods Company,
Ltd., vs. Jc.c Williams et als.-By rea
son of consent of parties this case is
remanded.
Dwight S. Hall (A. J. Hall substi
tuted) vs. Thomas Caplis-i. In re-es
tablishing a section line, the strveyor's
marks within the township are safer
guides than the surveyor's marks of an
adjoining township surveyed a year
later. 2. In re-establishing a boundary
line, in case of discrepancy between the
measurements of the original survey and
a natural monument, the latter con
trols.
Under the heading of rehearing re
fused is the case of J. T. McDade et al
vs. Bossier Levee Board. Amended with
tcasons as follows:
"i. By the terms of the ninth section
of Act 1c of x892, the grant of lands
made to the Bossier Levee Distract was
not to become operative until formal act
of conveyance of the lands so donated
Ild have been made to the levee

CRIMINAL CALENDAR.
Wash Means and Others Called for
Trial.
.This afternoon in the district court,
Judge A. D. Land presiding, Wash
Means and others, colored, were called
for trial, being indicted for conspiracy
to murder and shooting with intent to
murder Aleck Brown in Ward One on
May 29. 1902. The parties concerned are

The WllIsamu gae Joasa.
It would be ditficult, if not Impcs.si
ble, to estimate the relative frequency
of names prior to the Norman conqftest,
which created something like a revo
lution. "William," of course, got a
good start, as is shown In "Doomsday
Book," where stand 68 Williams, 48
Roberts, 28 Walters and 10 Johns. In
1173 Sir William St. .lhn and Sir Wil
l1am Fits-Hamon entertained a dinner
party at the court of Henry II. The
Invitations were limited to knights of
the name of William, and the company
numbered 120.
But the day of "John" was not long
to tarry, and In 1347 the common coun
cil of London contained 35 Johns, 17
Williams, 15 Thomases, 10 Richards, 8
Roberts, and in 1385 out of 370 names
enrolled in the Guild of St. George at
Norwich there were 128 Johns, 47 Wil
liams, 41 Thomases. From that day to
this John and William have held their
ground as the commonest baptismal
names in England.
The Lion or st. mars.
The symbol of the Venetian republic
-the famous lion of St. Mark-is made
of bronze. There Is a tradition among
the Venetian people that its eyes are
diamonds. They are really white, ag
ates, faceted. Its mane is most elabo
rately wrought, and its retracted, gap
ing mouth and its fierce mustaches give
It an oriental aspect.
The creatureas it now stands belongs
to many different epochs, varying from
some date previous to our era down to
this century. It is conjectured that it
may have originally formed a part of
the decoration of some Assyrian palace.
St. Mark's lion it certainly was not
originally, for It was made to stand
level upon the ground and had to be
raised up in front to allow the evangel
to be slipped under its fore paws.
Aneteat Legal Statute.
