W. P. Miller, Esq., railroad com
missioner from Vermilion parish,
was in Lafayette Thursday. Mr.
Miller, it will be remembered, is
one of three members of the rail
road commission, who so well
fought the motion to reduce the as
sessment of the railroad company,
especially of the I. & V. R. R. Co.
His move to assess the mortgage on
the t. & V. in Vermilion is, we be
lieve, the first action in that direc
tion, and 3fermilion can well flatter
herself to lave such a faithful and
vigilant commissioner. We are
sorry to say that Mr. Miller has
been obliged to give up the fight
that he had so far so successfully
done, though so much against odds.
