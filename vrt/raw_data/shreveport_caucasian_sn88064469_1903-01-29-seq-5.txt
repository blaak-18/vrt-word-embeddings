THE WORLD OF FASHION.
New 3ilka and Dataty Thin GoGoods
For Suamer.
Scarcely has lovely woman recovered
from the fatigue of Christmas and
New Year's when she finds that she
must take up the white woman's bur
den again and haunt the shops, for,
behold! they are full of the new silks
and the dainty thin goods for next sum
mer. Just think of it! It seems to
be an unwritten law that early in
January the white underwear sales
take place, and they are followed by
the advance of all the lovely and deli
cate materials for summer. This is
done so that during the forty days
wherein women fast and repent they
are enabled still more to mortify the
flesh by dressmaking, for, be it
known, most of the summer frocks are
made at this time. If there is any one
thing more certain than another to
TnIPD sTZ5rT GOWNs
mortify the flesh and cause tears of
penitence to flow,, it is to have a dress
miaker n the house.- So lovely woman
has, as-usual, managed to kill two birds
with one stone.
The new silks are mostly satin finish
fadelards and soft finish satins. These
are iprinted, and they are 't almost
equally a-ivaded into two large and
siall designs. -There -are p-erbap

The New
Woman and
The Old Man
I ' STERDAY I sat and listened
to the talk of the old men.
By "old man" I mean the old
style man of any age frees
twenty-five to 105. I have come to the
conclusion it is time for the old man to
reconstruct himself to fit the new wom
an. If he does not, he will find himself
left. This old man I listened to was a
very old man. His opinions are those
of the age of Tiglath Pileser and Je
honadab. He thinks man knows it all
and woman knows nothing except as
man imparts it to her. His definitioc
of a man is anything that wears trou
sers. This old man was talking to some
new women. They had learned in their
childhood that two and two make four.
It may be mentioned that they could
read Latin; also that they knew how to
pronounce French, Spanish and Ger
man. But the man was a Briton, there
fore a doubled and twisted old man.
Yet that ancient and mildewed old man
sat there and told the women of the
geography, the politics and the govern
ment of their own country with the air
of one who was announcing great
truths which the women would never
have heard if Providence by special act
had not raised him up to announce
them. You observe this is a way
men have--old men, that is. They pat
ronize the whole feminine sex and en
deavor to explain things down to Its
capacity. They expect to do all the
talking, so as to exploit their knowl
edge. They resent it if a woman pre
sumes to know anything out of her
own head. Such a female creature Is
extremely unwomanly in the eye of the
old man. She makes him feel hurt in
his vanity; therefore he never likes her
afterward. But the old man is being
Jarred in hfi vanity every day these
times. Will he learn thereby that he
must reconstruct himself and become a
new man to match the new woman?
A. man who is neither the old man
nor the new on the woman question.
but who is just lying low and taking
observations, confemes- himself per
plexed over girls. Heis a good looking
intelligent bachelor of thirty-five or
thereabout, not old enough to be
grumpy and set in his ways, yet old
enough to have left his goslig days
behind. He daily crosses mast river in
a ferryboat between Brooklyn and New
York. Many girl clerks and stenograph
ers do the same. The bachelor s.s:
"When I see these girls, they - :al
ways giggling about somethian -the
morning when _they come over-ffi
giggle and titter from shore to shore.
When they go back in the evere
they giggle and tittr an the w;ay agan.
It seems to me girls don't do anything
but giggle. What do the do it for? I
never eould-find 1ou." OCa you?

A GIRL'S LIFE.
And How It May Be Made as tOer
For Her.
"It seems to me life might be made
easier for a girl," sighed Mrs. Brown.
Her life had certainly not been ah
easy one, filled as it was with foolish
mistakes from beginning to end, includ
ing a most unhappy married existence
and a divorce.
"If some one, my mother for instance,
had taken the trouble to give me a few
practical talks showing me what life
really was, I might have been saved a
good deal of trouble, but she believed
that a girl's mind should be kept a
delightful and poetic blank--'sweetly

Innocent,' she termed it. I was taught
accomplishments and how to dress,
and, -yes, how to smirk and be an in
genuous little hypocrite, and the one
aim of my existence was to make a
brilliantly wealthy match. and justify
my mother's careful hothouse training
of me.. Even the books I was given
to read were of the 'then they were
married &ind lived happily after' orderl,
giving one. the false ides that life
stopped at matrimony and that eist-
ence thereafter was a soret of peaceful
dream. Oh, orrow! Why, it o-l

of all my troubles I tried to remac mbe

SELF CONSC1OUSNESS.
A Fault Which May Spoti Yuea
Child's Succesa In Life.
"Won't your little daughter play for
me?" The visitor's voice was full of
graceful expectation. Little Bessie
smiled back at her and arose from her
seat.
"Oh, I'm afraid you wouldn't care to
hear her! She doesn't play very well.
I never can get her to practice," said
the mother.
Over Bessie's face a change came.
She suddenly be
came conscious
of herself, of
her own weak
I nesses. She
hung her head
awkwardly,
squirmed and
finally put her
finger in her
mouth.
"Come, Bes
sie; play since
Mrs. Jones
wants you to."
"Oh, I-I
can't!" This in
a low, muffled
tone. More
twistings, more
awkward turn
ings, and sud
denly Bessi e
grew very red
in the face and
rushed from the
room.
"She is the
most awkward
' the mother.
S"I'm sure I
spend enough
TUK AWKWARD AOGE money teaching
her accomplishments, too, but she nev
er will do anything or act naturally
before people. I'm sure I don't know
what I shall do with her if she keeps
,on this way! And I don't know either
where she gets it. I never was awk
ward before strangers when I was her
age."
"ho," 'thought the visitor, "perhaps
your mother was a better diplomat."
Mothers, if you have self conscious
children, in. nine cases out of ten it is
your fault. Teach the child to forget
i.elf, to consider others firt, itself
