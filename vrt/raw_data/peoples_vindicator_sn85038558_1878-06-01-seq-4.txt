one of the principal Republicans of Th(

Among both Democrats and Re veins

in this matter. The co-)sequences of Here

The Senate after March 3, 1879, will wea'
be Democratic. The House is even ten
more necessary to the future success he s
of the party than the Senate. In decc
every district from Maine to Texas, we c
extraordinary efforts should be made snor
to send Democrats-real, live, earnest shoe
Democrats-to the next House of Re- the
presentative3. There is reason to ;dlel
believe that ia most sections of the
corntry there will be Democratic T1
gains, but no District should be e-.. l
glected. the.
Various subsidy schemes, and plans "
for the expenditure of public money, apt
are being pressed before the Senate, ve
that body being thought more likely insL
than the House to take the enitiative by
in such matters. It is a grtifying fact, tur
however, that even the Senate has witl
become aroused to the fact that there F
are people outside of the money and
centres, and that they do not wish to Wi
be taxed for anything except neces- son
sary government expenses. It is Is
said that Hannibal Hamlin heard yes
more plain talk from his old suppo*- giv
ters in Maine, during his recent poo
visit to that Stte, than he ever heard a
before. He came back, to be sure, ow
and immediately voted for an enor- fre
mons subsidy, but it was one in which' Wi

pears to have an interest. The mark- tin
ed change in sentiment in the Senate :m
will have a good effect iu the House. are
