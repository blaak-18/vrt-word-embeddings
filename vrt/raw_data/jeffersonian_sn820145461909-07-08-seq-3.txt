What Our Farmers Are Saying
and Doing
ON THE FARM AND OFF IT.
The establishment of a packing
house in Atlanta is of great impor
tance to Georgia farmers. It will be
built and in working order this win
ter. Before Christmas, says the
Southern Cultivator, we will be hav
ing carloads of cattle, sheep and
hogs coming into Atlanta to be
slaughtered. This will mark the be
ginning of the greatest movement for
the South’s prosperity since the com
ing of the cotton mills to our sec
tion. The clothing problem is a great
one, but the feeding problem is great
er, and our people are awakening to
the possibilities along this line. One
of our friends took us to a restaurant
for dinner the other day, and after
he had paid the bill we fell to re
flecting—the beef, the lamb chops,
the Spanish mackerel, the bread, the
butter—all imported. Nothing left
for the South except a little commis
sion and the expense of serving, the
rest all gone North and West.
Another project in which the farm
\ers of the State are vitally interested
Is the organization of a Farmers’
Union Warehouse Company in Atlan
ta, to look after the marketing of the
cotton placed in various Georgia
warehouses by members of the Farm
ers’ Union. The company, of which
the president is W. W. Webb of Ha
hira, Ga., and the secretary, R. E. L.
Evans of Thomson, Ga., will deal di
rect with the exporters and spinners.
THE SMALE STORAGE PLANT.
The town of Hastings, Fla., has the
most unique plant that we know of
in the South. She has a corn mill —
ice and cold-storage plant combined.
All of our towns in the latitude be
low Macon, Ga., would do well to pat
tern after Hastings in this particu
lar. When we were there in March,
we were shown thousands of pounds
of meat —lard and beef, all in the
cold-storage room. The farmers can
kill. a hog at any time and have the
meat cured at this plant. They not
only handle all the local beef, but
ship out quite a lot to other towms
along the railroad. We were much
pleased to learn that the men run
ning this up-to-date plant come from
Atlanta, and learned the business at
“Sawtell’s Packing House.” This
cold-storage plant is also useful in
keeping vegetables, eggs and butter
until the market demands are such
as to call them out. —Southern Cul
tivator.
HOME CONVENIENCES.
It is certainly just as important,
says the Southern Agriculturist,
Nashville, Tenn., to supply the farm
er’s w’ife with carpet sweeper, wash
ing machine, bread mixer, and other
labor-saving devices and kitchen con
veniences, and to keep knives sharp,
as it is for the farmer to have a sep
arator in the dairy and other modern
appliances and sharp tools. The
lightening of home burdens through
means of a well-equipped and hy
gienic house, by the use of household
conveniences and by the proper un
derstanding and systematizing of
home work means that the home
maker and her family may have op
portunity for something besides the
daily tasks which may otherwise
leave no time nor inclination for rec
reation.
COTTON CHOPPING DEVICE.
The newest device I have seen, in
tended for the benefit of the cotton
planter, is a machine which is at
tached between the standards that
carry the cultivator plow beams. It
is simply a heavy iron wheel about
four inches wide, which revolves on
an axle placed between the plows and
immediately on the row of cotton.
This wheel is in sections ten to
eighteen inches apart, as the farmer
judges best distance to leave plants
for a stand. Between these sections
on 'the rim of the wheel there is a
cup shaped “protector.” When in
operation the heavy iron wheel rolls
along on the cotton, mashing into the
soil all grass, weeds and cotton not
protected by the “cup protectors.”
While the cup is in position the
plows turn soil over the portion of
the row that has been mashed, bury
ing everything, but leaving the pro
tected cotton, weeds and grass in lit
tle clumps. This is not cotton chop
ping, but blocking, but it is a great
help in saving a dirty crop, as it re
duces hoe labor to a minimum.
Those who have used it, or seen it
at work, speak very favorably of it.
I am told it is the idea of one of our
black land farmers, and is being
manufactured by a firm in Austin.—

GET THE YOUNG FOLKS IN
TERESTED.
Get the young folks interested in
poultry. It will be an inspiration to
them and especially to the girls on
the farm. It pays to develop ideals
early in life and to make them prac
tical. Making a success with ten or
twenty hens will tell powerfully on
the future business career of any
young man. This small business in
volves all the essential features of
the largest business in after life. It
demands study and care in planning
and management. Industry in ex
ecuting details is necessary. System
and order are developed. The im
portance of meeting conditions suc
cessfully is brought out in feeding,
housing, caring for their health, and
maturing the fowls. Practical con
tact with humanity in selling and
buying is learned. Economy in cost
of production and saving for further
investment will help on to thrift and
business success. This is practical
education of the highest order. —

DO ROOTS POISON THE SOIL?
No one knows so well as the prac
tical farmer how rapidly a naturally
fertile soil may be exhausted by cul
tivation. In this country, the tobac
co lands of Virginia afford an exam
ple of this rapid decline in fertility,
Xst)e 3effersoalan
The abandoned New England farms,
too, help to illustrate the effects pro
duced by the constant cultivation of
the same fields. Land that once
yielded crops as if by magic now re
quires an artificial preparation be
fore it will reward the farmer for his
strenuous labor in the field.
Sir Oliver Lodge, the eminent Eng
lish scientist, is reported to have ex
pressed his belief in the theory of
the poisoning of the cultivated lands
of the world. The advocates of this
theory believe that the systematic ro
tation of crops is needless. They be
lieve that it is impossible to exhaust
the ground by a crop, as the food
supplies in the soil are too great to
admit of such a result. Other causes,
therefore, must underlie the failure
of a crop to what was once fertile
soil, and, according to the believers
in the theory, this failure is due to
root poisoning. According to the
poisoning theory a crop does not do
so well when it immediately succeeds
another of the same sort because it
excretes an active poison which is de
structive of its own germs. Artifi
cial measures are recommended not
so much as a food for the plant as a
remedy against these root poisons.
Very thorough investigation has,
however, recently been carried out at
Rothamsted, perhaps the most scien
tific farm in the world, which tends
to show that adherents of the poi
soning theory may have not yet suc
ceeded in fully proving their case. If
this theory be true, manure, in the
true sense, will no longer be neces
sary, but something to destroy the
poisons excreted by the plants will
serve a more useful purpose. As the
root poison is admitted to exist in
small quantities only, the treatment
of land by any new process looking
to this end should be much cheaper
than under the present system of
fertilization. Philadelphia Record.
FERTILIZER FREE.
Clarence E. Poe, editor of the Pro
gressive Farmer, has been writing
some forcible short articles under the
title of “SSOO More a Year.” In his
last article he clearly shows the folly
of buying commercial fertilizers
when the farmer can get them for
nothing—can even get paid for tak
ing them. He says:
“Nitrogen is one of the things we
must have if we grow crops; and if
we are to grow paying crops, we
must have more than most of our
soils now contain. Our cotton and
grains and grasses—all our crops, in
fact, except the legumes—remove ni
trogen from the soil; and even more
than the crops remove is washed and
leached away.
“This, then, is the problem we are
up against: The already deficient
quantity of nitrogen in our soils is
continually being reduced by the
crops we remove and by the action of
the elements. We must not only
keep up, we must increase the supply
before we can make the crops we
should. How are we to do this ?
“There are two ways: (1) We can
