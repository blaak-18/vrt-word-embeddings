"I do not think she will, Graham,"
said Mrs. Vannoy, confidently. "If I
command her respect, she will take
kindly to my teaching. I have faith in
Anne's common sense. She can be
taught the direrence difference between good
housekeeping and slipshod methods.
Graham, a strong boy can serve you.
Mrs. Maret tells me that her Jamie is
overwhelmingly anxious to learn 'the
doctor's trade.' "
" 'Trade!' That lanky, green boy!"
cried Dr. Vannoy.
"'I am speaking of a neglected, am
bitious lad whose parents consider him
the ugly duckling in their brood of
seven. Why not try Jamie?" said Mrs.
Vannoy, persuasively. "He has no en
couragement at home to make the
slightest effort to attain anything de
sirable. He will care for your horses,
uggy and ofice for small pay, his

"Of course, Molly, you'll have your

"Only wait-wait, Graham, and see,"
i urged the wife.
Anne Bolyn accepted without a de
mur the uniform provided by Mrs. Van
moy, when she noted that the "doctor's
lady" wore a similar dress.
"You see, Anne," said Mrs. Vannoy,
"it makes every difference the way
housekeepers go about work. The wise
woman who wants to keep tidy every
day wears in the kitchen gowns and
aprons easily laundried."
S"Shall I eat at the table with the
doctor and you, Mis' Vannoy?" in
quired Anne. "Maw says I mustn't
forget rm not a common servant."
"Some one must wait on the table,"
replied Mrs. Vannoy, calmly. "In the
Jaynes 'family, the three daughters
take turns in waiting. Once when I
dined there Master Willie performed
that duty. He was proud, too. of be

neceesary noise. Minnie Jaynes con-.

"I shouldn't think the richest man in

YOUNGEST CONDUCTOR.
Thlrteea-Year-Old John lnrmsm Beus a
Traln in Oregon.
John C. Barnum is the youngest ral
road conductor in the world. He is
thirteen years old. lie was born in
New York, but has resided in Oregon
for the past nine years. His home is
in Medford, Jackson county, on the
Southern Pacific. On January 20, 1898,
his father leased the Rogue River Val
ley railroad, which runs from Medford
to Jacksonville, a distance of five miles,
and as its revenues are light he took
charge of the engine and placed his son
on the train as conductor. He wears
the conventional cap and uniform,with
lettered brass buttons, and carries a
punch.
Conductor Barnnu likes his work,
and says that he gets along nicely ex
cept with some of the very smart
drummers, who are often on his train,
and who guy him about his inability
to handle their heavy baggage. He
had an amusing e-xperience with a big
fellow not long ago, but came out
ahead and earned the hearty applause
of a trainload of people. The big fel
low thought it would be smart to play
a trick on the little conductor before
the crowd, and when called on for his
fare said he had lost his ticket and
was out of money.
Johnny knew better, but told the
smart party that he must pay his fare
or get off. This was sneered at,and
the conductor passed on, while his
would-be deadhead snickered over the
joke. Soon afterward the eonduetor
slipped up behind tyie fellow, seised
his hat. and put it in the express chest
in the baggage compartment, calmly
locking the chest. The big drummer
followed him and demanded the hat,
but was quietly informed that it would
be held until he paid his t-te. Before
the train reached ita destination 'the
fare was paid and the hat' earrendered
t its owner; who anes iawswy amid
-the jeera of the crowd;.
