OUR WASHIIN(GTON LETTER.
WVAsiiIxuxox, I). C. Oct. 20, 1877.
The Congressional Silver Conmmis
sion, whose report, perfected during
tihe recess, is about to be presented
to Congress, clainis that the subject
I has been exhaustively treaited. If
A we may judge by what is given out
there has been a deal of research on
the part of Senator Jones, Chairman,
and 1hon. .eo. M. Weston, of Maine,
Sec etary. The Commission recoim
iiands the remonetizatiou of silver
and supporl ts that recoInteniidatiou
by lessons drawn from the experience
of every people under heaven, almost.
To recommend remonetiztization to
the present Congress is one thing and
to secure fovorable Congressional ac
tion is another. To get the approval
of Mr. Hayes would be still anotlher.
All these things the confident Com
mission expects to do.
Speaker Randall is properly and
charasteristically cautions in select
ing his Committeemen. Ilavilng lan
nounced his intention of making the
present Congress, so far as the lHouse
is concerned, an iniprovement on any
of its predecessors, he does well to
give careful attention to the making
up of his Committees. Hle has gone
to Philadelphia, in the quiet of that
city to consider the subject. I think
many of the 36 Democrats who voted
agains him in caucus are sorry for it.
ble of learning by eperience, and the
has improved immensely in the nlast
two years. I do not make any pre
dictions as to the chairmanship of
any Committee, not belIeving any
man knows at this time Wvho any of
the lucky members will be.
The House on yesterday adjourned
nover until Saturday, with an under
standing that no business should be
transacted on that day. All that it
has previously lone was to admit a
couple of Republican claimants from
South Carolina and a couple of Derm
ocrats from Louisiana, and to swear
in the Republican miembers from Colo
rado.
rIn the Senate, Edmunds introduced
a resolution to form a Commission of
seven Senators to consider the laws
governing the subject of declaring
the Presidential vote. No decision
-has been reached as to the admission
r of Spoffordl of Louisiana, as Senator.
His credentials were yesterday re
Sferred to the Committee on Privileges
Sand Elections, to be considered with
those of Kellogg. The vote on this
e reference was strictly a party vote,
except that David Davis voted with
the JDemocrats. This inudicates that
he would have voted for the imime-.
diate admission of Spofford.
Among the numerous nominations
sent to the Senate by Mr. Hayes 'n
Wednesday none excites more conm
ment than that of Gen. Harlan, of
) Kentucky, as Justice of thIe Supreme
Court. There is considerable ad
verse feeling, but as both the Ken
tucky Senators will support confima
tion, it is not likely there will be
- trouble in that direction.
Senator Davis, of West Virginia,
yesterday introduced a resulution
substantally th same oas that of a
year ago, authorizing a Comntittee to
inquire into the cor ectness of what
are l)opulaily known as monthly
statements of the public debt. The
Senator will get his special commit
-tee this time and not have his reso
lution referred as before to a stand
ing committee with more business al
ready on hand than it can attend to.
Mr. Hayes a few days since ten
dered to Robt. Lincoln, son of the
I late Prrsident, the position of 3d As
sistant Secretary of State. Mr. Lin
coin declined it. A son of William
H. Steward, President Lincoln's Se
cretary of State, is First Assistant.
The little disturbance in Texas has
subsided, and no further trouble is
anticipated in tiat quarter. The
ularrel was on this side of the Rio
I nViude1 and betwien our own cit
Regula, worlk for the session has
iiot yet c',tilflied. Monday being
"bill day1 in tfih house, we shall soon
havIe jtestistdtlj li doubt1 multitudes
of menasurtis, significant and inlsi`gi
ficant, from all sBrt ions. Then rwill
appear the imlpossibilitv. of adjourn
in bIefore the comflol, ricer en t of tlhe
I)eeemrber fii ion. Then the com
mittee will begin to labor, and to
find ill the great fna.ntity of chaff the
fe'w grai.ns of wheat. It is not likely,
unless hepublicans gnancel among
themnselvyes that there will Ie a great
deal of talk durinrg the session.
