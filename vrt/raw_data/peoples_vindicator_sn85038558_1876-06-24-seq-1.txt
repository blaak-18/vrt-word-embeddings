In some lone fen there idle breezes dally
And somberly green willow-branches

With willing feet I oft would stand above

And with esd eyes your moss-grown

Thinking that once each said to each "I

But no you are not dead; the world

Kneels at your feet and calls your face

Praises your beauty, worships till it bores

Though on your face have dropped no

And .you and I, who once were maid and

of Williamson, believing that the ie- I
groes and the straightout Radicals i
will never accept Williamson not take a
their candidates from Kellogg. Hence; i
with chariacteristic "chiek," lie is the t
most confileut and sanguine of allt
the candidates, and is only troubled t
by the sturday opposition of Packard t
and Grant, his old and insatiate ene- a
mies. Packard swears Warmoth will I

State, and indulges gloomy forebord- I
ings of the emergencies of such a
nomination and of the need of large
military appliances, and the multi
plication of blank warrants to secure
a fual and peaceful vote.
But Warmoth relies on the Return
tug Board, whose efficiency in count- I
ing in will be increased by a few im- '
agined rows and menaces in temote
country districts, and a skillful man- t
ipulation, in somne dark corner of the I
State-House; of the returns by the ex- (

If the Oetober elections in the North

Radicals, Warmoth thinks he can I
work this old game more boldly and
less perilously than he did in 1868; t
and in the fouot years folldwing.
This, we believe, is the authentic
programme already inaugurated by
these various chiefs of the malignant,
audacious and plundering gang, which i
seeks to peoietuate tour years long

disgrace and spoliation bf the people
of Louisiana. .

The Coushatta Afair.
From the N. O. Bulletin.
It is not too much to say that when I
the Republican party shall have "put
off its corruptible body" and been
burried past the possibility of resur
rection, the epitaph which will most
succinctly and truthfully tell to future
politicians the cause of its demise,
will be simply this : "Died from too
much investigation " The profane
exclamation rectntly made by old
Zach Chandler (which everybody re
members, but which to-day we won't
repeat, except to say that it was
something about having no fan in a
warm place, and something; also
about a Democratic House of Repre
sentatives) was evidently the expres
sion of a profound convictioi-- a coin.
viction which we fancy must be very I
fully shared by Blaine and Belknap,
Babcock and a host of other Repub.
lican officials about this time.
The shooting of Twitchell and King
at Coushatta last April was seized
upon by the whole Radical press of
the country as an evidence that Re
publicans in Louisiana were in dan.
ger of their lives by reason of their
politics alone. It was purely politi. -
cal in its character, and the white
people of the State were held respfpu
sible for the atrocious deed. The
thing was written up in the most
sensational and blood=curdling man
ner, and virtuous villains all over the
countrj who Bre themselves steeped
in crimei lamented the awful condi
tion of society in which a poor fellow
Wds almost assassinated be4~a-e-as
they tlhdse to assert; and as nataiy
doubtless believid-lhe was a repub
lican. Ben outltmr, the good od- pi
ous old spoedn takers grew indignant
enoughl about It to write a letter de
nouacing our people, with thie same
conspidu0ibs impudence with which ihe I
previonsly robbed them.
It was "nuoots" for thie Reptblioaa-
was this Coushatta affair, and itq col
umnas fairly reked witlth blodd for'
weeks and weeks thereafter.
Knowing the falsehoods that would
be told about the matter and the eap
ital that would be made out of it by
thIe Radical press, we were extremely
desirous that the perpetrator of the
deed slhould be Emught, an urged
upon the peoplle of Coushatta the ne
cessity for leaving no stone unoturned
to secure his captures W4 espreseded
our irm conviction -that whra the
mystery ws untraveled it would be
found that thie affair was purely per
sonal, geroting out of some private
dilioulty.
SThe result of the invsItijattsdn of
,ithe Congr6eoaloa Sub-Committee,
Swhich is given in asn iteresting let
ter in this issue, very folly sustain
our voiewaepresed at the time. It
proves conclusively that there was
notlhig whatever political in the i·
i sault on Twitehell and in the killing
of King, that it was a personal mat
ter-the deed of totle man who had
beeen deeply wronged hi a way thit
was Irreparable.
There is a storp eurrent in and
around C~dishdatta whib is generally
Sbelieved; aid which furnishes a key
to the desperate ad determined as
sault upon Twitebell, who has btee
held up to thb Idrld by the Rfepub
Sas a a mraa of piire Mild blameless
life. Thepubc a l has dwblt very
particularly upon the purity of
Twitchell's life, but if the allegationd
now made be tree, and they are well
vaouched for, then the only Wondtr is
that the asnsault upon him wis not
made at ad eiarlier day; Offenses of
a similar character are summarily
- punished the wide wonrld over. Judge

and parochial affairs. Thus end the ^1
investigation of the Coushatta trag- fal
edy, and thus is killed one more of st
those campaign horrors which Mor. ftl
ton and Conkling and Blaine has hop

are only too eager to believe all the ol

We hate tattlers, and we don't cale as
who knows it. n
If the scheme of creation had not hi
Included them; we should never have Is
shed a tear on account of it., e
Tattlers grow fat on the failings of he
other people, when they might easily
get to tip the scales at 300 on thif gi
own tailings. a1
Communities abound in tattlers, W
and they make more trouble in the PI
world than small-pox, and measles, st
and musquitoes thrown in, to say it,
nothing of fleas and cockroaches. o0
Just as soon as Mrs. A. says some- ms
thing a little against Mirs. B., your ti
miserable tattler starts out and tells ni
it to Mrs. B., with variations. "Site T
feels it her duty.to do so ! She feels al
as if Mrs. B. ought to know about It,
for her good !" of
Then Mrs. B. flares up, and says di
something severe about Mrs. A., and fa
the delighted tattler runs back to ct
Mrs. A. and tells her about it for her st
good ! ti
And the thing goes on, and a life- .i
long feud is the resrilt; involving a ft
halt-dozen other parties who are fool- tE
islh enough to take sides. 01
It is a good rule for every one to ki
make on starting out in life-never Ci
to listen to any who comes to tell you il
the evil Some one has said of you.
People will talk-there is no help at
for it i but no person can be sincere- c(
ly your friend who come to you with tl
the idle tales of popular gossip. It at
does not matter if Mrs. C. says you ft
are stingy, or Mrs. D. thinks your m
cheek bones are too prdminent. If
anybody does not like you, it will do R
you no good to know it. You will B
live just as long, probably, as you r
would if they worshiped you. of
Tile time spent in listening to such
things is worse than lost. You had f
better be reading last year's almanac, oI
and finding out where the "sign" wtas t
a year ago at this time.
When you make up your mind to ei
hatve nothing to do with tattlers, they oI
will let you alone; but if you listen ti
to them, they will make your life an
happy, and who is benefited f No ,

Fall and Spring Plowing.
I read many articic. in yfoiir alps
on raising corn, anld some advocate
fall and others spring plowing. I will
state nmy practice and reasons th~rb
for, as brietly as I can.
After our harvest work is over,
and briers and weeds are cleared out
of all fence corners of the farm, we
lay out our corn ground in 20 feet
lands, by shallow furrows, start the
manure wagons, and one hand to
scatter as evenly as he can, and imme
diately plow under abiout sisl iiher,
deep. This work is done in the latter
part of July and August. At this
season the fields are solid, and ma
nure in good or light. condition fo~
hauling.' The only objection is, the
land is hard to plow. This we over
come as well as we can by a three
horse plow team.
My exiperience has been thadt Soti
ground plowed later that August, Is
not always safe from either the cat or
web worm. I have practiced August
plowing for 10 years, and in no in
stance has corn in this ground been
injured by them. We usually put
our coin on clover and timothy sad,
manured and plowed in this way. Ii
the following spring it is again powed
nine inches deep before planting.
This brings sod and manure withid
about three inches of the surface.
The advantages are-let, no wasti
of manure by evapotation or washinpg
during winter. 2d, with ds, i iiervet

cut worms. 3d, ground well pulveri
sed by breaking and freezing. 4th;
the ground is much more easily put
in tilthl, and the rich propertiea.f tfq
furrow-slice are just where I want
them to insure a quick, strong gtowtdi
of the seed and the surface from ba
king--which is very injurious to the
crop at the time of coming through
the ground.
This process insures an early irop;
and my plan is to cut and shock the
corn by 15th of September, harrow
the ground well, and sow with wheat
and timothy, sowing clover in the
following spring. J. H.-Ohio Far

icatfloidte of Soda i 'ootiighi'd
Remedy.-Dr. Duckworth, of St.
Bartholoanew's Hospital, Londoni Ilid
recently successfully used bicarbonate
of soda as a remedy for severe tooth
ache, when applications of chloro
form, either eiternally to the cheek
or to the ear, or placed on cotton Ih
the decayed tooth, failed; and when
carbolic acid, applied as last mention.
ed, also proved inoperiitive. Pledgetd.
of cotton, soaked in a solution of
thirty grains of bicarbonate of sods
in one fluid bunce. of water gave al.
most instant relief. Dr. Duckworthl
considers that very frequently thi
pain is due to the contact of acid sali
va with the decayed tooth; and,
therefore, it is important, in cases of
.dontatlgia, first to determine whether.
the saliva has an acid reaction. If
'this be the case, then a simple alka
line application, as above stated, id
the most efficacious means of care.
Cases of toothache are snch com.

ground is due the eflicacy ofanimonia'

which, if applied carelessly, is liabld
to produce more pain by burning the
