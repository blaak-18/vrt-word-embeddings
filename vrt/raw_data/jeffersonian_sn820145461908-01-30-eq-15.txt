They relieved Andrews ’ brigade, and I
joined my company as they marched out of
the loft plank, having lost in killed and
wounded, 690 men, out of 1260 carried into
action. As the brigade left the firing line
the sun sank behind the western hills, hiding
its face from the bloody scenes being enacted
on the ill-fated Plains of Manassas. After
Generals Lee and Johnston surrendered, the
armies of Generals Grant and Sherman re
nrned to Washington City. The government
fieials were not satisfied with the terms of
rrender, allowing the officers and men to
jturn to their homes, not to be disturbed by
the United States authorities so long as they
observed their obligation and obeyed the laws
in force where they resided. Thew wanted to
confine all the leading men in the South, both
civil and military, in Fortress Monroe. When
General Grant heard of it he went to the of
fice of the Secretary of War, and hot words
passed between them, the secretary telling
General Grant, “I will have you to know, sir,
that I am the Secretary of War.” 4 ‘And 1
will have you to know sir,” said Gen. Grant,
“that I am the commander-in-chief of the
army, and before the terms under which Gen
eral Lee surrendered shall be violated, I will
draw my sword again.” That settled the
question, and the Southern people should hon
or the memory of General U. S. Grant for
the stand he took in behalf of the Confeder
ate officers.
After the surrender Federal troops were
scattered all over the South, and a company
was sent to capture General Toombs at his
home in Washington, Ga., but as they entered
his front gate he leaped the back fence, mount
ed his horse, and made his escape. After
dodging the soldiers for several weeks he
made his escape from the country, going to
Cuba, and then to England, where he remained
until it was safe to return home.
