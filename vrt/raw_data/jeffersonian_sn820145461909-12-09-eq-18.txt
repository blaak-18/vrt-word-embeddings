News comes to this office that a
certain web-footed negro “doctah,”
who is so black that a piece of char
coal would make a white mark on
his face, was arrested in this city a
few days ago for “speeding.” When
arraigned in court the next morning
he gave as his excuse that he was
going to “delivah a white lady in a
case of confinement.” He stated that
he had been detained at a railroad
crossing about ten minutes and that
he feared he w'ould not get to the
home of his prospective patient in
time.
Precisely this, the big liver-lipped
professional coon was afraid that he
wouldn’t have the delightful oppor
tunity to wait on a white woman
wdiile she was laboring in the throes
of her first born.
The woman’s husband was in court
to corroborate his statement con
cerning the case of obstetrics, and
the court turned him loose. I would
have sentenced him to be hung by
the neck until he was as dead as
Hector, if the limit of my jurisdiction
was thirty days on the rock pile.
I never will believe that it was the
' ! sh of that mother that she be de
livered by a big flat-footed Senegam
bian.
This negro, whose great-grandfath
er slew his enemy with a club and ate
him, dresses like a full-fledged hu
man being, puts an M. D. to his name

NEGRO MEN ASSISTING AT BIRTH
OF WHITE CHILDREN.
Dear Bro. Watson: —I herewith
hand you a clipping from the Dallas
(Texas) Pitchfork. What do you
fiunk of it? It makes my blood boil
to read such stuff, —not the com
ments, but the facts therein stated,
if they be facts.
Every issue of your weekly and
monthly Jeffs gets better, seems to
me. Let’s down this ship-subsidy
deal if we can. I am surprised at my
Union friends for being
caught with such bait.
Your friend,

13 S.—What number of Collier’s
Weekly contained the infamous slan
der about our Southern 'white wo
men? Ido not take it, hence did not
see the editorial you often refer to.
W. A. B.
Answer.
I think that a white man who calls
a negro man to deliver the white
man’s wife of a child, ought to be
taken out. and whipped within an
inch of his life. Then he should be
compelled to move to Patterson, New
Jersey—which is next door to hell.
Collier’s Weekly printed that in
famous insinuation against Southern
women last March. The words
were—
“lt is well known tliat the negroes
who were lynched, were in many
cases FALSELY ACCUSED BY
WHITE WOMEN AS THE EASIEST
WAY TO ESCAPE SCANDAL.”

wire, lumber, etc., without the help
of many others.
The producer should divide with
those whose nelp he got while pro
ducing. When we talk of giving him
“all that he produces”, we talk non
sense.
We oppose the national banking
system; the alien ownership of land,
and the holding by railroads and oth
er corporations of vast areas which
are not necessary to their legitimate
business.
We declare that the irresistible
power of Government should not be
used to build up one industry at the
expense of another.
We demand the election of United
Stafpß Senators bv direct vote of the
people.
We demand the withdrawal of the
special privileges which create pri
vate monopolies and .trusts. We say
that so long as monopoly privileges
remain in private hands, they should
be taxed to the full value of the
privileges.
Those are the Populist principles.
We have stood by them without ma
terial change since the Farmers’ Al
liance and Knights of Labor agreed
on them at Ocala, Florida, twenty
years ago. r If put into effect, those
reforms would make our republic,
once more, a people’s country,- gov
erned by all the folks in the interest
of all the folks.—T. E. W.
