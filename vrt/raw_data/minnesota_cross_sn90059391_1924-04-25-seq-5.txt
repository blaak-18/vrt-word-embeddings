TRIO FROM ST. PAUL
AT CHURCH SESSION
(Continued from page 1)
H. Morton of Minneapolis; A. M. Pe
terson of Coleraine.
C. B. Mitchell of St. Paul, bishop
of the St. Paul area, which includes
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and South Da
kota, although not a delegate, will
attend the general conference, as will
are ry other Methodist Episcopal
|>ishop.
850 Delegates Expected
There will be approximately 850
.delegates from all parts of the Unit
ad States and from forty-four nations
and territories abroad. Delegates
from the foreign field elected to. rep
-resent the various national groups of
Methodists abroad number 78, among
arhom are nine women. This gath
ering is representative of the 4,774,-
€2O members of the Methodist Epis
copal church around the world and is
the law-making body of the denom
ination. All decisions made by it
are final unless reconsidered by the
toody itself.
The delegations consist of an equal
Slumber of ministers and lavmen from
162 annual conferences which elect
ahem. Their number is determined
toy the membership included in the
annual conferences.
The plan for unification with the
Methodist Episcopal church South,
erhich was drawn up by commissions
from the two denominations, is to be
considered by the conference. It is
anderstood that the outlook is con
aidered favorable by officials whose
opinions are of weight. It provides
for the churches to be united into
4>ne church with two jurisdictions. If
the plan is accepted by the general
.conference of the Methodist Episco
«>al church in May in Springfield, the
general conference of the Method
ist church South, which normally
sneets in 1925, probably will be called
In special session to consider the
plan. Acceptance by that body will
fnake the plan effective. It is un
derstood that large sections of the
gnembership in each of the two
are in favor of unification
and consummation of the efforts of
•the past decade are regarded as high
ly probable through the action of
6he two conferences.
Episcopacy to Be Reviewed
Another question to be reviewed
and which will attract the attention
4>f the entire Christian world, is the
atatus of the Episcopacy of the de
nomination. The entire system of
Episcopal supervision will be consid
ered. It is impossible to predict what
turn this action would take, but all
regard it as one of the most weighty
toefore the church today. The ques
tion has not been reviewed in the
past twenty-five to fifty years.
The entire organization of the be
nevolent boards of the denomination
Is to be considered, and the plans dis
cussed for reorganization. Several
plans have been discussed in various
parts of the church and a commis
sion was appointed to study the ques
tion. The conference will decide
whether the present ten highly spe
cialized boards will be combined in
to a single general board with many
departments, combined into a smaller
group of four or five, or left as they
stre.
Church folk throughout Christen
dom are interested in the machinery
with which the Methodist church will
undertake its world-service program
After the conclusion of the five-year
centenary expansion movement for
which $70,000,000 was given. The
morning devotions and the lectures
and addresses of the evenings will be
broadcast through Westinghouse
WBZ. Extensive exhibits of the work
of the church in all divisions will be
beld in conjunction with the confer
ence.

WOMEN URGED TO
ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS
(Continued from page 1)
of scorn for women fearful of being
“unladylike” or “impolite to the
president of the United States” when
it came to a question like the equal
rights blanket amendment.
“Women always have been looked
on as the ‘weaker sex’ and they will
continue to be if they are not of the
temperament that makes them afraid
of voicing their demands to congress
and being impolite if necessary to the
president of the United States,” she
said. Women have got to get rid of
some of that sense of inferiority and
they never will until they have the
‘gumption’ to stand up for themselves
and not make requests but demands
first on the government and then on
employers for equal hours and equal
pay with men in business.”
Miss Vernon admitted that the
chief obstacle in the way of passage
of the amendment was the women of
the United States themselves. She
referred to the representatives of
the sixteen great women’s goups in
the county, including the General
Federation of Women’s clubs and the
National League of Women voters
that had appeared against it, accus
ing them, however of representing
many more thousands of women than
they actually did.
“You women have got to do some
boring from within the General fed
eration and the League of Women
voters,” she said, declaring that no
matter if laws removing discrimina
tions against women were passed in
the several states they would never
be on entirely safe grounds until a
federal amendment was written into
the constitution.
Miss Vernon praised the laws of
Minnesota, declaring that they were,
in comparison with other states, fair
to the women, but declared that the
proposed amendment would wipe off
the statute books any inequalities
and do much to help the women from
other states suffering from glaring
discriminations.
TTie theory propounded by oppo
nents of the “equal rights” amend
ment that the measure would put
married women in a position where
their husbands would not have to sup
port them and where they would be
obliged to pay alimony in case of di
vorce was scorned by the speaker.
Ask Woman Question
“How many of you married women
think your husbands are supporting
you entirely?” she asked.
The hand of an attractive young
woman out of the large gathering of
women shot up.
“Well, what about your work in
the home? Don’t you value it? Are
n’t you making a contribution?” Miss
Vernon shot at her. And to the
amazement of the group she an
swered:
“Not much.”
“Well, at least you are honest,”
Miss Vernon replied. “But not many
married women really are being sup
poted entirely. We find, too, that
while women’s services in the home
are undervalued greatly, that their
value goes up tremendously when
they are injured and the husband un
der terms of the law’ in many places
has a right to collect the damages for
even the mental suffering of his
wife.”
Miss Vernon declared the Women’s
party believes that much of the leg
islation aimed at the protection of
women which opponents of the equal
rights bill were worrying about was
a real handicap to them.
Senator Khlpstead Scored
A tirade was delivered against Sen
ator Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota
for his “vacillating policies,” and the
women were called upon to make it
clear to him that they didn’t want
him to go on equivocating on the
measure. Senator Magnus Johnson,
it was said, was in sympathy with the
amendment.
On recommendation of Miss Ver
non a resolution was adopted which
called upon congress to submit im
mediately the equal rights amend
ment, extended thanks to these con
gressmen from Minnesota who had
pledged support to the measure and
called upon the remainder to work
and vote for the submission of the
amendment.
Mrs. Laura Camp Jones of Minne
apolis was unanimously elected chair
man of the reorganized branch of
the Women’s party; Mrs. A. E. Colvin,
St. Paul, first vice chairman; Mrs.
George Sundby, Minneapolis, second

FIXE OIL STOCK
NETS 5 BILLIONS
Worthless Shares Held by
Laborers, Tarbell Tells
Senate Committee.
Washington.—W. W. Tarbell, veteran
oil operator and brother of Ida Tar
-I*ll, historian of Standard Oil, told the
senatorial Teapot Dome investlgatora
that there were floated In this country
In 1921 and 1922 a total of $6,000,000,-
000 par value of oil stocks and that
over 90 per cent of these dotations
were, as be pot it, “fakes.”
“You are an oil expert?” asked Sen
ator Spencer (Rep.. Mo.).
“I am an experienced oil man,” Mr.
Tarbell replied.
Trail Leads to Many Trunks.
Out of the abundance of his experi
ence he then gave the senators this
astounding survey of oil stock manipu
lation, first commenting on the alleged
90 per cent bogus In the six billion
flotation.
“Whether these figures can be con
firmed or not,” he snld, “we know they
are not far wrong; further, that no
one of these wrecks Is listed with the
total of $4,000,000,000 of par value oil
stocks on the New York stock and
curb exchanges, which average In the
market quotations considerably above
par
"Now, as to the bogus stocks, the
shares which represent them are hid
den away In the broken trunks and
bureau drawers of men and women
who labor—their values te them only a
sickening memory.”
The witness continued with a sen
sational narrative ef Mammoth Oil
manipulations, referring to Harry Sin
clair as “a prince of manipulators.”
“Mammoth Oil was thrown Into the
market through the curb October 9,
1922, by an advertisement offering at
S4O, and the first transaction was
at $43.
Public Not In sn It.
“It was In the hands of a master
manipulator, and, ranging from a high
of $43 to a low of sl7, the net result
was seven stockholders, consisting of
three Individuals, three corporations
and the stock syndicate. The general
public had no stock interest, except In
so far as 3,300 shares of short con
tracts may be Interested.
“It Is the street rumor that these
short Interests were forced to settle
at $l4O per share, which means that
If you had sold 100 shares at S4O, you
would have stood a loss of SIO,OOO.
“Sinclair has been quoted as remark
ing, 'I am a gambler; that Is why they
follow me.’ The ‘lnvestors* who fol
lowed him were not only shorn of their
money, but had not even a share of
stock to line their trunks with."

Robed In Basement
The evening of the presentation,
the Klan members gathered in the
basement of the church to robe be
fore going into the main auditorium.
Several men, some of them so-called
prominent business men, let their cu
riosity get the best of them, and
tried to spy on the Klan members,
hoping thereby to identify some of
the men
The local Kleagle was also threat
ened by Donohue before the acid was
thrown. He was told by the disturb
er to remove his glasses, as he had
something to settle between them.
The organizer replied that he saw no
reason for removing his glasses, but
if Donohue wished them removed he
was free to try it. Donohue with
drew from the argument.
Given New Bible
A new Bible from the Oxford press
was presented to the Methodist min
ister. In thanking the visiting Klane
men, the pastor in eloquent language
explained the principles of the Klan.
its Christian character, high ideals
and nobility of purpose. It was said
that his audience was the largest that
has ever gathered in a northwest lowa
church.
The pastor thanked the Klansmen,
placed the Bible on the pulpit and in
formed his congregation that it would
be read in every religious service
held in the chuch.
Feeling is quite tense, and much
indignation has been expressed by
Sheldon people, and those of near-by
towns and country, about both the
criminal conduct of Mr. Donohue, the
defendant, in throwing the formalde
hyde into the eyes of the Klansman,
and also the snooping and belittling
tactics of certain well-known resi
dents of Sheldon, all known to the
Klan, in trying to discover who the
robing men were in the basement of
the church.
The whole matter has been handled
as real Klansmen always handle such
matters, the proper authorities noti
fied, names of the disturbers given to
the officers, the witnesses of the af
fair gotten together, and their names
turned over to the county attorney,
and all assistance given them in se
curing orderly legal procedure in the
arrest and apprehension and trial of
the accused.

Frost Articles
in Book Form
Writer of Outlook Series Ac
complishes Wonderful Piece of
Reporting In Telling Story of
Ku Klux Klan.
By SPENCER D. IRWIN
The Challenge of The Klan, by Stan
Ivy Frost, SOSpp, The Bobbs-.Werril
Company, Indianapolis.
THE articles on the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan which were
published in The Outlook mag
azine, written by Stanley Frost, and
republished in Klan newspaper*
throughout the nation, have been puF
out in book form. It is well that tfet
results of Mr. Frost’s investigation*
are thus preserved, for while the au
thor is not a member of the organi
zation, he handles the subject in *
fair and unbiased manner.
There have been many books writ
ten in recent months apropos of the
Klan movement. All of tnem—with
the exception of the one under dis
cussion nave been of a sensational,
general character. They have bee*
advertised as exposes and startling
revelations. They have been biased.
The authors have without exception
been opposed to the Klan. But her*
we have for the first time a story
which can be classed as one of the
outstanding pieces of reporting of
the year. Frost does not color his
work; he simply tells what he found
and what he was told by Klan offi
cials. He does not retell any vague,
unfounded charges against the or
der, as has been done too frequently
in other works.
There is much criticism directed
against the Klan in Frost’s book.
Criticism which points out weaknese
es and deficiencies. But it is con
structive criticism.
Frost had access to Klan records?
he was taken into the confidence of
Dr. Hiram W. Evans, Imperial Wi*-
ard, and other national officials, and
the plans of the order in a national
