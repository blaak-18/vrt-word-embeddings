OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Not a single one of the pictures of
Daddy Jim came near enough to the
original to afford any excuse for pass
ing it on to the engraver, but some
of them showed that the young artist
had taken pains to draw an effective,
if untruthful, portrait, and so we
feel constrained to award the prizes
we promised.
FIRST PRIZE.
Miss Floy Harris, R. F. D. 2, Roys
ton, Ga., sends a picture of a young
gentleman, with a bushy head of red
hair, an up-tilted nose, and a soph
omorically sweet expression; and
another, picture of the same individ
ual, inscribed, “This is the way I
imagine Daddy Jim looks when he
gets mad.” They seem to be origi
nal, and are well drawn. Miss Floy
writes: Hello, Daddy Jim, here I
come again. lam sending you your
picture, and hope to win the prize.
Papa has just renewed his subscrip
tion to the Jeffersonian. Our school
will be out Friday, but I haven’t gone
this term. I have brown eyes, dark
hair, fair complexion, and weigh 82
pounds. I will close, hoping to see
my letter in print.
SECOND PRIZE
Goes to Miss Pauline Persons, 9 years
old, R. F. D. 3, Monticello, Ga.,
whose letter was published last
week. Her ideal was a man about
forty with a heavy, black moustache
and beard, and a face not unlike
Charles Dickens.
THIRD PRIZE,
Not for its likeness, but for careful
drawing, is awarded to Miss Lura
Fields, R. F. D. 1, Flippen, Ga. This
was the portrait of a young fellow,
with a heavy face, and a nose like
that of the typical city politician;
probably this was the result of its
being shaded “not wisely, but too
well”.
ONE FROM ROME.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I have drawn
your picture as I thought you looked,
but I know it won’t take the prize,
for I suppose you look some better
than what I have drawn. As I have
never seen you, I hope you will ex
cuse this, if it does not favor you
any, which I think it will not. My
father is a farmer. We live 12 miles
from Borne, Ga. There are nine
children in our family, two boys and
seven girls. We always raise lots
of cotton. —Your friend, Claudie
Taylor, R. F. D. 2, Rome, Ga.
(Allow me to say, with much em
phasis, my friend Claudie, that the
picture does not favor me, in the
least. Still, you are a truthful, in
dustrious child, and if no one does
any better, you will certainly win the
prize.)
WHERE ARE THE PICTURES?
We had a good rain here yester
day; it looked like the overflow. We
live in a very droughty country, and
we appreciate water very much. I
would like to be a school teacher.
I help milk the cows, wash the dishes
and sweep the floors. We had com
menced to plant, but rain stopped
us. I will send our pictures,—my
Jeffersonian
sister Carrie, aged ten; my sister,
Lena, aged eight; and I, aged nine.
My grandpa takes the two Jefferson
ians.—Lizzie Adams, Harlington,
Texas.
(We shall be glad to print the pic
tures in the magazine, whenever you
send them.)
ENJOYS READING THE LETTERS.
I am a little girl, seven years old,
and live in the country. We have a
telephone exchange in our home. I
like to go to school. I am in the
fourth grade. Our school closes to
day. I love my books and my teach
er dearly. I enjoy reading all the
letters of the Post-Card Club. I am
going to try to win the picture prize.
—Matilda Lula Jones, La Grange,
Ga., R. F. D. 1.
(The gentleman pictured had an
Irish cast of countenance, and wings
like the Angel Gabriel. Daddy Jim
is not Irish, and hasn’t grown any
wings—yet.)
TRIED TWICE—TRY AGAIN.
I was in the name contest, but I
see some other little girls and boys
beat me. I will try in the picture
contest. I enjoy reading the letters
so much. I hope Mr. Watson will
always give us a page in his paper.—
Maud Jones, R. F. D. 1, LaGrange,
Ga.
(This is a close relative of the
Irishman drawn by Miss Mattie
Jones. His chin-beard has a more
pronounced curl. By the way, a chin
beard that sticks out like a worn
paint-brush is a detestable append
age.)
DUTCHMAN THIS TIME.
Hello, Daddy Jim: I thought I
would come again. I hope I will not
make any mistakes this time. I am
sorry 1 made the mistake the other
time; but I am glad you corrected
me, for it taught me a lesson that I
never will forget. My school will
start Monday. How many of you lit
tle girls enjoy helping your mamas in
the house? I do. I am sending your
picture, which I have just finished.—
Minnie Winn, R. F. D. 2, Royston,
Ga.
(Glad you were not hurt at the
correction. No, I am not a Dutch
man, though I wear glasses.)
MANY OCCUPATIONS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I will tell you
what I do in the holidays. I cook,
sweep, iron and sew on my quilt. I
have picked a little cotton and take
music. I can ride our mule, and milk
a little. I can cook cake and fry
chicken, so you see we will not starve.
I am always sorry when school is out,
for I like to go. Last term, I went
every day, and got the prize. But
you need not think I work all the
time, for I have jolly times chewing
cane, eating boiled pindars and
grapes. I play dolls a little. I
have a pile of paper dolls. Papa
takes both the Jeffersonians, and en
joys reading them. I am 12 years
old, and live in the country—Blanche
Young, Quitman, Ga.
