Compromise
The latest from New Orleans
private sources, indicate that a
compromise of some kind will be
«•fleeted by wliidi,.the Conservative
members will again take their seats
with a majority iu the House. The
Conservative as well as the Repub
lican members have placed their
propositions in the hands of Mr.
Wheeler of the Congressional Com
mittee, who has taken them on to
Washington with him, and prom
ises to give a speedy decision on
the same. The propositions are iu
substance, as we understand, as fol
lows:
The Conservatives to go back in
tlio House, reorganize and elect
their speaker, Moucurc's election
«s Treasurer to be conceded and all
parochial officers that were elected
iu November to be immediately
commissioned. The understand
ing is, that tlio Conservatives do
not revolutionize the State govern
ment or impeach Kellogg for any
past acts. The Conservatives do
not recognize by any act or confes
sion the /rand of 1872, nor change
in the slighest, the attitude of the
general government towards Lou
isiana. The acts of military inter
ference oil the part ol Grant, is now
if chapter iu the common history of
tlje country and nothing can eîlacc
its effects. The compromise as we
understand is virtually a back down
on the part ofthe administration at
Washington, asking that the pill
boa little sugar coated before tak
ing. The vote ofthe Conservatives
on the compromise question stands
r»«S yeas to 6 nays. Away troni the
scene of action, we necessarily trust
to the honor, integrity and wisdom
of those who represent us, and will
not at this time express any opin
ion as to the right or wrong ot the
agreement made. We hope that
Louisiana that has suffered so long,
may be rescued fiom the hands of
her oppressors, without the slight
est blot ou the honor of her people,
wln>liave stood by her so heroical
ly iu all her troubles.
While wo Ute willing to trust to
the wisdom of our Representatives
and know that they will act conscicn
eiously, wo wish to sny that we are
violently opposed to any compromise
wnich acknowledges the validity of
the Kellogg usurpation, either for
the past or future. Wo can very
well let that question stand where it
i« at present. We do not propose to
relieve Grant and Congress* of the
odium of their acts iu sustaining
Kellogg by force. This is a question
that had much better be left where
it is. As to the action of the Caucus
in making any compromise which ef
fects only their own position, they
havo the right to do as they think
right, subj ct to their responsibility
to their constituents for any errors of
judgment. We aie not sufficiently
wtll informed at this time as to thu
terms, to criticise the now plan of
compromise, bnt have every conti
deuce in the ability and integrity of j
the repieseutiiti res of the peuple. !
CUE POLITICAL OUTLOOK.
Our political sky at present pre
scutsgsome phenomena not less in
teresting to the Statesman than the
recent transit of Venus has been, in
the. world ot astronomy.
There are at present two great
lights clearly above our political
horizon, which are not only new,
but strange to our system ; so
strange indeed that they are politi
cal comets which have broken
loose and wandered here Iroin some
far olf system of despotism and in
their rapid progress, are crossing
the orbits ot every great conslitu
tional question.
The attentive observer of our po
litical sky need not be told that we
allude to the contraction of the cur
rency, and the third term, and it
comets ever had Satelitcs we would
"bay that the latter is but the Sate
lito of the (ormcr. Nor docs the
likeness of our illustration end here.
Comets iu all ages have been re
garded as the harbingers of (amine
and pestilence and civil commotion
but there are none iu the history
of astronomy which have brought
a more fruitful harvest of woe, than
that which is promised by the visit
of these strangers to our system.
Already beueatli the blight ol con
traction, commerce has stagnated
and the poor been starved out ol
employment. Hut it is it's political
by.and not iu its commercial aspect
a
that wc wish to examine.
Ah a political power nolle have
been claimed by the federal gov
eminent, which is so omnipotent
none which can be controlled will
so much skill and certainty and no
theatre so grand as that, of 1S7(» up
on which it is destined to play s
important a part. The capitalist
ofthe East measured its full impur
tauce when it was brought to bear
upon the turbulent strikes ol th
well fed, well paid and well housed
lahorors of their mines and work
shops ami rail roads and under tin
subtle pretence of returning t.
specie payments the contraction ol
the currency has silently gone on
until the turbulent masses win
could not be subjected by armies
have been starved into submission
and made willing to accept theii
bread from the hands of charity.—
It is well known that, when the oil!
for inflation was before. Congress
tlio President had pledged him
self to sign if, and had already
prepared his message for that pur
pose. The capitalists of the East
and the Mast itself knew too well
the importance of the issue to lea v.
any stono unturned, ahd a special
messenger was sent to remain witli
and ply the President with argu
incuts until they should, and did pi t
vail.
Xo decission so important has been
left to a single will sin^c t he forma
tion of this government. It was a
decission in favor of the supremacy
of the East over the West; ofthe
supremacy ofthe rich few over the
toiling millions. This decision has
made Gen I. Graut the ideal; the
pifppct of capital.
^I'lie question is one of too great
importance to the East to risk a
change of front in t he face ol the
powerful West; and therefore Genl.
Grant and the third term has be
come, an imperative necessity. As
ittle as the world may think it, is
not the ambition of Genl. Grant,
which has originated the term, but
the far reaching Statesmanship ot
Eastern capital Its repulsiveness
to the American mind was not un
known to its originators, but they
knew that iu twelvo months it
would become more familiar and in
two years it might be persuaded
by golden mouthed argument to
embrace it, and the toiling millions
who cannot l>e thus persuaded will
be starved by contraction into sub
mission. The spirit of the great
West will be broken by poverty and
the whites of the South will be
trodden under foot by military
power, while the negro under
the guise of the elective franchise
will do the biddings of his masters.
tip Upon the first proposition of
compromise we are glad to know tlmi
oar three members stood solid
against it. We are now informed
that the vote of the whole caucus is
{56 yeas to (5 nays—two Rapides mem
hers voting nay, upen the present
compromis«?.

KI.KVENTn DAY— FlïB. 4,1875.
Robert P. Hunter—Live« in Ra
pides and is solo editor and propri
etor of the CrtMca#ma,.and also an
attorney nt law. In 18(18 f here was
the usual excitement attending the
Presidential election. It was a
matter of gene:al notoriety that
the negroes were massed at. Alex
audria iu au aimed body. The po
lice disarmed these blacks, which
prevented the occurrence ot trouble.
I ii 1S70 the same thing took place
the negroes marched to Alexandria
and left their arms in the vicinity.
Tlicy voted iu a mass, having iu
one case, exclusive possession of u
poll. The Republican candidates
were elected and quietly took their
olllccs. The Liberal Republican
movement in 1H7LÎ embodied nearly
all of the white«, but witness whs
opposed to affiliation with War
moth's paity.
At this election the negroes com
plained that they were not allowed
to register; they were armed and
came in bodies, but there was no
disturbance. In 18(18, '70, '72, the
colored people had secret meeting^
at Hi.-ir political clubs, not from
any danger of assemblage iu the
day. but because it suited the de
signs of their leaders. In ;dl of the
campaigns invitations had been ex
tended to the blacks to join the
Conservative movement, but very
few availed themselves ol this re
quest.
The argument used to prevent
their acqniesence was that the do
mi crats, the white people, would
ret urn them to slavery. The Can
ctiKian was the first paper to sug
gest the color line division iu poli
tics, the first editorial oil that sub
ject being published in the edition
of March 28, 1871. Witness read a
port ion ofthis aiticle, where the
expression White Man's pa.ty was
used for the first time.
'I he arguments used by the whites
were that the colored people repre
sented the laboring element, and
the whiles the capital and the intel
ligence, so that n union of the two
would add to the mutual prosperi
ty of t he races.
'1 he formation of the White
Man's party was not as a means of
oppressing the blacks, but to unite
the whites.
The people believed in 1871 that
there was not Utility iu attempting
to cany the election as the fruits
of victory would tie taken away by
the Republicans, assisted by the
Federal Administration.
If a struggle had not been made
in the campaign of 1871, the result
would have been that the negroes
would have carried out their plan
of Africanizing the State; that is,
tilling the olllccs with people of
their race, and inviting negro immi
gralion from the neighboring States.
This was the only considération
that united the whites, and urged
them to take part iu the lute
election.
The campaign in Rapides com
menced iu .lune 1874. There was
more division among the negroes
than hitherto; this was caused by
the refusal ol their prominent pica
chers to follow the general rule of
meddling in politics. Eight or ten
of the colored leaders joined the
Conservative party.
When the news of the 14th Sep
tember reached Alexandria, resolu
tions were passed and the McEnry
ollicials were installed iu the most
peaceful manner, the positions be
ing resigned by the opposite party
wiihout any feeling.
The election was quietly conduc
t ed ; tJ. S. troops were quartered hi
the court house yard. They pre
sented a request to the sheriff,
which was signed by Gen. Emory,
but had come through Gov. Kel
that the troops should be al
lowed to quarter iu the courthouse,
tint the building being being newly
finished the request was refused ;
Lieut. Reiger, commanding the de
tatchmeut camped his troops within
he enclosure, oil three sides of the
house, 80 or 40 feet from the polls.
Senator lvelso was U. S. supervisor
ind Porter republican commission
r.
Captain Snow with a troop of
nine or ten cavalrymen was
I the town, their horses being
in the livery stable, and the men
4i*ouud about the polls.
Some of the negroes voted the
Democratic ticket, no force of any
liind being used to influence them.
Iii the neighborhood of the differ
ent, polls throughout the parish
squads of troops were stationed.—
I 'uiing the campaign no hindrance
would have been offered to any re
a
publican who desired to canvas tliej
parish. The latter party are accus
tomed to ilo their canvassing iu se
cret.
The labor question was agitated
to some extent; a paper was taken
around to get signatures of mer
chants and others, but was soon af
terward destroyed. Negroes c.*n
always get employment, and there
is a demand for labor. Some of
them own land and work hands of
their own color.
There has ne*, et been a secret or
a
u
ganizafiou among the whiles in Ra
pides— no White Leugne; none in
in the Red River Valley ; the rela
tiona between the races are peace
ful and have always been so.
In 1873, while tiie District Court
was in session at Colfax, Capt.
Ward, with his band of armed ne
groes, took from the court house
some men who were under trial and
brought them to New Orleans.—
Witness also detailed several out
rages committed by negroes iu the
country; the murder of Yawn, and
the hoiriblo outrage ot Mis La
cour,
Rcfore the Colfax light, threats
were made by the blacks that they
intended fo kill all the men and re
serve all the women. Witness pre
sented a list compiled from the ofll
eial records of all the homicides
committed in Rapides from .Janua
ry 1st, 1808, up to the present time.
The summary is 57. Total whites
17, blacks 40; whites killed by
blacks,blacks killed by whites,
10; whites killed by whites, 0;
blacks kilted blacks,28; whiles kil
led by unknown persons,.'!, blacks
killed by unknown persons, 2; sui
cides, 2, executions no e.
Three out of this list were con
victed ; one escaped from jail, and
another was sentenced to the Peni
tenti.uy for twenty years, and has
lately been pardoned by Kellogg.
There are 500 or more cases lor
petty .»Ileuses which have never
been tried.
None of the homicides on the list
were political broils.
The juries are black, and the olll
ccs are held by republicans, and
the white people are in no wise re
sponsible for the crimes.
Roth whites and blacks are wil
ling enough to convict, criminals,
but the iiictlicioncy of the criminal
law, more than anything else, influ
enced the coloicd people to vote for
white people.
There are very few white Repub
licans iu Rapides, Gov. Wells is the
most prominent one, and his family
is not in the least ostracised. His
sons and daughters mix with the
best society, and are always well re
ceived.
Many republicans have been as
sociated with schemes ol fraud and
plunder, and they are avoided iu
the same manner as a thief or a
burglar would be.
The witness read a statement, un
der the signature of the Parish
Treasurer, of the indebtedness of
the parish, which amounts to $.11,
.7.14.
The police jury have managed the
finances as well as they could be
managed, and have lieeri engaged
in no schemes of plunder.
Thirty-four hundred votois were
registered at the clect',ou.
The rate of the State tax before
the war was It» of one percent, on
a valuation of over three millions ;
in 1 .'tT.'i it was 20 mills, and in 1 .ST 1
14 mills. The State tax proper, is
4 mills; the balance is a tax for
paying the interest on bonds, the
levee tax, and the school fax.
The causes which urged many ne
groes to vote the Conservative tick
et at the election were, that they
were dissatisfied with the Freed
men's Rank, the nou execution ol
the criminal law, the assurances of
protection from the whites, sind the
chief cause was the collection ofthe
poll tax iu 1874, which had been
neglected previously.
After the result of the election
was known, the colored people had
a large meeting a^id passed resolu
tions to the following eltect: That
tney denounced the action of the
Returning Hoard in falsifying the
returns; that, the only intimidation
practiced was that against the
white people by the troops. At an
other Conservative meeting at least,
two hundred colored men attended
some of whom made speeches, and
declared that the election had been
perfectly f»*ee and fair. The hope
lessness, the want or confidence,
and the universal distrust and de
pression, are due to the interfer
ence ot the Federal Government
with State affairs. There is no an
tagonism against the National Gov
ernment.
To cure the existing evils it would
be necessary to put iu the Govern
or'» chair a man iu whom both
white and black have confidence—
a man who has had no connection
with politics in the past. At the
time of the Cuban complication the
Southern people would lwyre taken
be to put tliem back into the posi
tion they held before the order of
Judge Durrell. Rather than sub

and his corrupt oihcials they would at

On che 14th September the move
A provsHpnal government is to 1
be preter^W to a ne w election under,
the auspices of military power. j
Iii 1872 there was fraud on both i pie
sides, uud the real result is not lo

ple of the Nort" to avenge the na
tional honor. The people are oppo
sed to any interference of the Gen
eral Government, and one step to
wards curing their troubles, would
ment was partly toseeurea military
Governor.
bo determined, but witness believ 2
that McKtiery was honestly elected
on a fair count.
Mr. Hour asked what Grant could
do under the cireuuistauces iu 1872.
Witness replied that lie blamed
Congres« for taking iia action.
Mr. Honr *nhl nobody in lionisi
ana had suggested what Congress
should do.
W i n ess thought that the status
before the order of Judge Durrell
should be restored.
Chairman—And to settle the
question by a party war.
There would havo been no wnr;
the Kellogg government would have
fallen to the ground for lack of sup
port.
Mr. Frye told witness to answer
yes or no when he could. The
questions of Mr. Frye were directed
toward the election ju 1872. Ho
asked if such frauds as were com
mit I oil in Rapides and Natchitoches
had been found in other.parishes
would not Kellogg have boon elect
ed !
This tlio witness acknowledged
would have been the fact.
Mr. Frye argued that from the
census there must bo many more
Republicans than Democrats in the
State. Several extracts from the
(Uiue<man were read by Mr. Frye,
and also an aflidavit made by wit
nessc's father.
Mr. Hunter, iu explaining the ar
ticles in his paper, said flint the
people intended to seat those repre
sentatives who had becu rightfully
elected, in spite of any force that
Kellogg could bring into the
outside ot any coiillictsritii tho U.
S. t roops.
Mr. Hunter said that his paper
endorsed the Colfax affair for thu
following reasons : That it was de
termined to make a test ot strength
at Colfax ; that they had assembled
there from till parts of the qpnntry
to make a light; that the women
and children fled iu all directions on
account of the reign'of terror that
prevailed, and that had the whites
failed iu parayliziug the movement
it. would have spread, and many
negroes been killed.
Mj*. Frye said lie did not think
that witness should have tho right
to make long explanations as it took
up so much time.
Mr. Marshall stated that he con
sideied it just fo>,thc witness to be
allowed the opportunity to explain
his statements.
The chairman ruled that the wit
ness should We permitted to explain
his remarks before the subject upon
which lie was being questioned had
been dissmissed.
Louis Texada—Resides in tho
parish of Rapides. The condition
ofaftuirs in this parish has been
peaceable, and at the election the
only intimidation used was that
»y ..... uu ,.tc fr .
ditiered in his opinion of tho Äatis
tics of the 1S7^ election.
The election in 1874 was the fair
est, since reconstruction. Ile con
curs with Mr. Hunter's statements
as to the features of the election.—
In regard to the Colfax light Mr.
Texada said it was a battle in the
interests of civilization. Witness
stated that he had been engaged hi
putdic lilc up to the war.
The assessed value of the proper
ty iu the parish before the war, iu
eluding slaves was thirteen millions;
now it is less than two millions.
'•'lie remedy for existing political
evils would be to recognize the Go
vernment ot '72. Tlio Southern
people are anxious toestabl.sh kind
ly teintions with die Federal Gov
ernment; they hate war, and have
not had peace,since war. They are
longing for peace. The State has
looking to Congress for a so
lution of |M>litical difficulties.
Mr. Wheeler—Everybody is look
ing to Congress, and blaming Con
gress. What is it to do ?
A. Tho only power Congress
would have in the matter would be
to advise the President to withdraw
his military. The Conservatives
would then have tho House of Rep
rcserÉhûvcs.
KijK^g has been so manipulated
by It Is party that he has not been a
tree agent. The people would have,
been no confidence iu Gov. Kellogg
or any other man with his surroun
dings. The people do not trust his
Legislature.
Mr. Wheeler—The people believe
that although Kellogg might have
the desire to administer the Govern
ment properly, the material about
him would not admit ot hid doing
so 1
A. Exactly.

In the North there are two great

Mr. Frye—Did tho Democratic par*
ty embrace Wartnoth in order to
secure the machinery which War moth
possessed iu order to secure the nom
iuution of supervisor of registration?
* ""
A. This was not tbe case. Tb»
white men were disheartened with
the rusult. of the election in 1872,
and to urge them to exertion in 1874
it was resolvtid to form a white mane
party.
Q. Don 't yon believe it was the
purpose in forming a color line, to
intimidate the negroes into joining
that party ?
A. I speak for my own parish :
this was not the idea.
Q. Did you justify the 14th of Sep

A. Yes.
Q. l)id yon justify tbe Örant paf*

A. 1 did not.
Q- Did you tell Gov. Kellogg not
to send troops to Grant parish ?
A. Do not think I spoke to him
about Grant parish ? 1 went to see
him about the sending oif troops to
Rapides, as there was no necessity
for it.
Q- Do not a majority of the wbitea
justify the C lfax masseere?
A. They do.
Q. Do you approve of the CÜooshat

A. Do not, and expressed my die«
approbation at the time.
Q. You dou't think that tbe peo

A. No more than at other times.
By Mr. Hoar— Q. Are yon not sat

A. They hnve ) showed tMr ehe*»

Judge Manning stated that be had
never intimidated tbe supervisor at
Rapides ; that he was in the clerk's
office when the returns were brooghl
in by the commissioners aftelr having
been compiled. He was requested
to dictate tbe certificate which the
law requires the supervisor to sppend
to his statement. This he did to tbe
deputy clerk. With regard to ffcè
Colfax massacre, tbe latter portion of
the proceedings relating to the kill
ing of the prisoners was condemned.
The people have not the confidence
that the courts will bring éliminais
