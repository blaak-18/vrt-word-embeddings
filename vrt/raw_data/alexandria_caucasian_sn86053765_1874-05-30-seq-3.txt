Oar New Orleans Correspondence.
New Orleans , May 22d, 1874.
To d* Editor s of Caucasian :
Your correspondent gratefully ac
knowledges the receipt within the
last week, of two issues of your very
valuable journal of dates May 2nd
I and 9th respectively. He desires to
thank you for your courtesy, and to
add bis feeble bat hearty echo to the
" loud voice of applause, which so gen
0 erally greets toe birth and baptinm
c of your bright and beautiful bantling
The children of political literature,
born in this age of " Chaos and Old
Night," are in general snch sickly
specimens of gangrene and garbage,
. that it is an event as' welcome as it
is rare and unique, to hail the ad
"veniof one born with health and
hue pure and undefiled, away np
from the miasmatic flats of Caucus
upon the shining beigbtsof Caucasus.
It was a happy thought of yours,
Messrs Editors, to fix the cradle of
your neogil upon that natal and
true mount of vision of the white
man j'and a still happier one to call
it by a name so distinctly suggestive
and significant.
j The Caucasian, in its very imprim
atur carries a most falicitous formula
to express the whole high argument
of the duty and destiny of the race.
The present anomalous condition of
affairs, by which that duty and ©des
tiny have been so long obscured and
confused, must of necessity be ephe
meral and is duejn a great measure,
to our 0 own supine apathy, and even
work our criminal complicity in re
gard to it There was no occasion
v because the resuit of the war was ad
Terse to tho slavery of tho negro that
o we should abjectly accept as its cum
ulative issue that the white man
should absolutely exchange condi
tions with him, or what has been far
more fatal, that he should eagerly
admit bis equality and solicitously
court his alliance. But this in that
evil moment of despondency, incideut
upon our defeftt, we did. We made
haste to propitiate the favor of our
conquerors by recognizing tho new
Idol they had set up in their selfish
g,reed and hypocritical humanity, an:l
even preposterously sought to rival
them in the frequency, the fervor and
the importunitie u of our devotions.
The unholy worship has had itsnat*
ural result. The idol has turned
from the stupid Log, which he was
at first into a devouring Stork. His
Deity has not been dignified—but
his devotees have been degraded and
destroyed.
Tho Press, which is the Priesthood
of tho people, have been the most
frantic and the mo9t culpable in this
deplorable lapse from the worship of
the true faith. They have too gen
erally bowed the knee to Baal, and
zealously swung censors of adulation
Qliud offered sacrifices of shame at his
shrine. They have incurred th'è
curse of "eating the broken meats"
that have been offered, and by induc
ing the people to partake of the same
prohibited diet, have involved us all
in the ruinous rigor of tho anathema.
Is it not time for us to repent and
forsake our apostacy, to discharge
our itnbicile Heresiarchs a,nd to turn
back to that clear and candid Evan
gel, which the Caucasian, and a few
other journals, as our own little New
Orleans Bnlletin for instance, uow'sij,
faithfully and fearlessly proclaim ? It
is a most cheering sign of hope and
promise, to see such vigorous cham
pions springing up in their young
true full armed might, to do battle
with tho Powers of Darkness, which
have so long overshadowed and de
filed our high places. And a still
moro cheering one to note the om
{»basis and enthusiasm of the popu
ar applause of your efforts. Fea,r
not that they will fail to support
you to the end of the chapter, what
ever it may yet contain. You are
young and feeble yet. But tho day
of small things is not to be dispised.
The Cony is a feeble folk, yet have
they their habitation in the rocks.—
The cloud no larger than a man's
hand, delated into the hugo nimbus,
which refreshed and restored the
land and people, parched and devas
tated by a three years Plague of Fa
mine and of Drouth. TbG little stone
"that smote the Imago became a
mountain and filled the wholo earth."
We want no moro blind leaders of
the blind tumbling us all into filthy
ditches of Fusion and negro affilia
tion. You have shown us tho true
causes of this most calamitous crisis.
Bern teligisti acer. The mairf one is
true skin deep. It is a case of con
fused complexions simply. Wo have
in your cry against that abomination,
a caution and an illustration.
O formose puer, nimium no erode

man trust not the nigger. The white
bouquet will wither, tho black nose
gay will be chosen. Let us use no
mora political cosmetics, to in vain
attempt to purify his immutable
blackness, and rub no more cheeks
against his, to defame and contami
nate our own in the contact. Let
him enjoy his freedom and his filth—
his fatuity and his franchise. We
wish to disturb him in neither. But
we will not have him to rule over us

This gentleman left on the Bart
Able on Wednesday last, for a short
trip North, to communities not so
poverty stricken as our is, to raise
iunds to complete the new church
building of the congregation of the
Episcopal Church here, oj which he
is the zealous and efficient .Rector.
We earnestly hope that ho may
succeed, for if there is any one
character of evidence positive and
conclusive of any community being
wide awake, aud on the road to
prosperity, it is the prese?nce of
churches. No community can do
without them and prosper.
We hope soon to see a more sub
stantial structure completed for
Mr. Ogden's congregation than the
one which was blown down by the
storm two years ago. And we have
no doubt that the new church will
be an ornament to our town, and
shall be a monument to the liberal
ity of more fortunate people, aud
to the energy of the congregation.
We commend Mr. Ogdeu to the
people of the places he may visit,
as being an abln, eloquent aud con
scientious Minister of'the Gospel,
who has the unbounded respect and
esteem of our whole people, and
who will give them only a strictly
correct statement of our condition,
and of our necessities.

Condition of|Trade in New \ork.
We copy the following, from the
American Commercial Times: ®
The stagnation in general business
still continues, and with very few«ap
parent Indications of a change for the
better. It is many years sjnee this 1'ity
experienced such a prolonged and gen
eral extension of hard times as that
which prevails at present. It is now
eight months since the actnl panic ter
minated, yet our citizeus still continue
to suffer from its results. It would
seem, as this journal intimated at the
time, that the panic struck the material
interests of the city with a force which
prevented its extension to other places.
Of course, thert< is a great deal of busi
ness transacted here, and strangers vis
iting us might not*notice any decrease
in commercial activity. But persons
more familiar with "our city and capable
of seeing below the surface, know that
business affairs are" far from being sat
isfactory. J
Respecting the prospects for improve
ment it is feared that tho season is too
far advanced to permit any very great,
change for the better. Itiss^t. how
ej*r, yet too late®for an aÄve and
prosperous Spring rade.
In the meantime the prolonged stag
nation of buisness^in this city bears
hard upon the middle-class interests
generally. Itisgetting to be nioreatj^l
more difficult to realize collections. The
retail dealers are unable, for various
reasons, to meet their engagements
with the wholesale merchants with
their usual promptitude, and the latter
have consequently a heavy load to car
ry. It is calculated that in the provision
and grocery trades alone the wholesale
merchants are compelled to renew und
carry «^'»ligations of their customers to
an aggregate of about ten millions of
dollars. *
This will give "our .readers some
idea of the distress that exists in
the great financial centre of the
ffniou. We" are really having hard
times in Louisiana, and imagine
that Raptdes is in the worst possi
ble condition of any section iu° the
wholo country. But the scarcity of
money, aud want of confidence, is
not confined to us,° but is general
throughout the United States. ^
The agiiculturisjfc are suffering
greatly in every section, and unless
Congress inaugurates some finan
cial measure that will meet the ap
proval of the President, and which
will give us more and cheaper mon
ey, the^'iancial distress, aud gene
ral prostration of business, will con
tinue for sometime to come.
Beautv an«l style are not the surest
passports to respectability—some of the
noblest specimens of womanhood that the
world has ever seen have presented the
plainest and most- unprepossessing appear
ance. A woman's worth is to be estimat
ed bv the real goodness of her heart, the
greatness of her soul, and the purity and
sweetness of her charaeten and a woman
witli a kindly disposition, and a well bal
anced mind and temper, is lovely anil at
tractive, be her face ever so plain and her
figure ever so homely; she makes the best
of wives and the truest of mothers. She
has a higher purpose in living than Wie
beautiful yet vain and supercilious wo
man, wlft has no higher ambition than to
flaunt lier finery on the street, or to grati

How to Oct Iii» «Migrants.
(From the Boni Carolinian.)
That immigration is desirable is almost
universally conceded. .We need laborers,
intelligent, efficient laborers, but, above
all, who shall bav« an interest in the wel
fare of the coilntry, own property, pay tax
es, ahd help by their votes and by tue in
creased prosperity they would bring, to
make taxés light. It is men—white men.
who comes here with their families, and
come to stay, that we want. It matten
comparatively little where they come from
provided they are intelligent, industrious,
law-abiding people, aud become perma
nent settlers. Europeans and Northerners
should be equally welcome. Once estab
lished here, their interest and onrs will be
one, and all can work together to promote
the prosperity of the State.
Well, the practical question is, bow
shall we get such immigrants 1 It strikes
us that we are not at-present, at least in
South Parolina. taking the right course.
We are calling loudly for immigrants, but
are not placing before them the proper in
ducements to come here—that is as a gen
enri rule. We appeal to them as laborers
We ask them to come here and work for us
for wages—very low wages too. They can
work for other people at home, or if they
come to America, they can get far better
wages at the West. But the better class
of immigrants, the class we wast, do not
come here to wörk for wages. Many of
them may hire out for a time, and there
will always be those among them who will
be available as hired laborers, but the pri
mary idea withthein all is to become land
owners, and make themselves comfortable,
permanent homes, and w<- shall never get
them to some here in large numbers till
we recognize this motive and appeal to it
in some effectual way.
We have- surplus lands in abundance
Our undeveloped resources are immeuse
Our climate is unsurpassed ànd greatly
superior to that of the West. No country
in the world offers to-day so many advan
thO'tages as South; and,
I whatever prejudiced or politically inter
I e8 t®d partis» may say to the contrary,
there is no region, where the immigrant
if well disposed, will meet with a warmer
welcome or kinder treatment, or lind more
sympathizing and lielpfuV neighbors.
Do not these facts suggest the means of
inducing immigration? We think so.
The immigrants-want land. They gen
erally have a little money, but not much.
Many of them are not aille to buy land
but could put up a log-house and stock
little farm. We have millions ot afires of
|good unimproved laud that is utterly use
less to those who own it. Might we not
advantageously offer a portion of this sur
plus to immigrants on the sole condition
that they settle on and improve it^. Who
does not see that if one-fôurth of all our
land were disposer! of in this way that the
remaining three fourths would soon be
worth far moro than the whole now is.
One may give fifty acres, another a hun
dred, a third five hundred, (divid^into
small tracks,) and so on. The aggregate
would amount to millions. Then let the
fact be published to the world in several
languages, made known througliont Amer
ica and Europe, together with the advan
tages of soil, climate and social privileges
connected with it, and extra facilities af
iorded for getting to these lauds and com
mencing operations on them.® Here would
be substantial inducements to these peo
ple, and they would not be slow to see
them. n
All parties "would be benefitted by such
an arrangement. The immigrant would
get a home, the country would get good
citizens, we should get the labor we need,
(but shall not get by our direct appeals,>
for these people would bling with them or
draw after them a surplus of bone aud
muscle adapted to our purposes.
We are aware that this is no new idea.
A few have offered to give land to immi
grants on certain conditions, and attempts
ha«'o been made to induce a general move
ment in this direction. The time had not
come. We believe the country is now
*ipe for it. What we want»at the present
time, is concerted, organized and persist
ent effort. An individual can do little in
this matter The people of the State act
ing togerher, can do every thing.
Perhaps no better agencies for initia
ting the enterprise can be suggested than
our County Agricultural Societies. Will
they not take hold ol tho matter at,wee
and iu earnest ?

Refunding or the Cotton T ax.—
The following is frorp the telegraphic
correspondence of the Cincinnati En
quirer :
Washington , May 19.— The Rep
resentatives of the Cotton States have
been caucussing from time to time, in
order to Itarmonize upou a measure for
the refunding of the cotton tax. At
one time there seemed to be a prospect
oLguccess. A bill was drawu by some
o?ybe most distinguished of the South
ern Representatives in Congress, which
was a fair compromise aud adjustment
of the rights and equities of the two
classes specially interested in this
measure, namely, the planters or pro
ducera, aud t>j% merchant or factors.
It has been obîTous to all disceruing
persons that unless substantial justice
was done to both these classes iu the
bill proposed nothing could be secured
for either.
It is only in an entire aud cordial
union of these two interests that a re
funding bill can stand any chance be
fore Coiigr.-ss ; but the very justice of
the proposed seems to have aroused
the opposition of certain Representa
tives of limited experience in public
affairs, and by their persistent efforts
the bill has been changed' and ingeni
ously worded, so as to give eve^thing
to the producers and to leave the mer
chants and attorney out in the cold.
Tho assignments by which the latter
hold their rights are not recognized iu
the news bills, and every possible
obstacle is interposed to both the mer
chant and the attorneys deriving any
benefit from the measure. The result
of this unfair aud grasping spirit will
almost certainly involve a defeat of the
bill at this session, whetQr merchants
or producers will get anything.

R ise and fall of P etoledm F ob
tunes .—It is noC only individuals who>
have suddenly increasad in prosperity
and as suddenly gone down lnto|ooth
ingness ; there are cities of which the
same can be said. Such a one is Pit
hole City, Pa. Within one month
from the completion of the first liouse
this city had a telegraph office, and
hotel, costing the owners $80,000. In
one month more there was a daily pa
per established, and in the next
theatre; in another month another
theatre, and then an academy of music
In six montus there were seventy-four
hotels and boarding houses; in the
seventh month the city had reached its
highest prosperity. It then had 15,060
inhabitants, elaborate water works,
Imli, and an expensive city govern'
ment. Then occured the completion
of a labor saving enterprise, the so
called Miller, Farm Pipe Line, by
which the petrolenm was sent off inde
pendent of the laboring population
At once 4,000 persons were thrown ont
of employment, while 2,000 horses be
came useless ; this Was the death-blow
for Pit-hole City. At once the hotels,
the theatres and the telegraph office
were closed, the daily paper- gavé op
its gohst, while almost .every one pack
ed their trunks and moved ont. Only
nine families remain ont of a popula
tion of 15,000 souls, while'the railroad
from Pit-hole and Oleopops rnns only
one train a day, consisting of a locomo
tive with a single car, which usually is
empty, but the company is obliged to
keep running, otherwise the charter
for the road would'be lost. They still
hope against hope for bettej times, fbr
better times, for. that nufortunate city,
which in only seven months was born
full grown, got sick and died. Un
doubtedly this is a case nnparalled in
all history, modern or ancient; neither

Civil Rights Hill—/ efeat of the Sup
piemen tar)/ Bill. —Washington , May 25.—
Motions to suspend the rules aud take
np the supplementary civil rights bill and
the currency bill were defeated, tvro thirds
not votiug in the affirmative. The vote
on the civil rights bill was 153 to 84; not
two thirds.
The defeat of the supplementary civil
rights bill in the house to-day is not a fin
ality. To be sure the Senate bill cannot
be reached, except under a suspension of
the rules by a two thirds vote, and that—
as shown by the action of the House to
day, cannot be secured, but the Judiciary
Committee, under its leave to report at
any time, can report a bill which is a per
fect copy of the Senate bill, and this can
be passed by a simple majority, and sent
over to the Senate aud there aoted on.
In that way the supplementary civil
rights bill may. and within a very brief
spuce, find itself in the President's hand.
The ameudatory tari 8 and internal rev
enue bills reported in the House to-day
contains the following clause: ''Any far
mer or planter may sell, at the place of
production, tobacco of his own growth at
retail, directly to the consumer to au
amount not exceediug $100 annually.
