,.- ICOPYRIOEZ, 1895.1
Maurice Ingraham strayed into Gou
pil's, as he did nearly every day, in or
der to indulge in a quarter hour of
homesickness for the paradise of art
from which he had been exiled by
means of a rich legacy. When one
falls heir to the estate of a childless
uncle worth several millions it de
prives him of the delicious makeshifts
and economies and excursions of the
guild of painters. It has been said that
champagne tastes and a beer income
are a cause of miseries. But an income
which seems to cnstraiq to champagne
all the time might prove equally
oppressive. Ingraham was conscious
that the men who had worked beside
him in a certain famous studio in Paris,
now that he was rich, tried very hard
to treat him in the old cordial way.
But he felt the patronage of art toward
money, which is loftier than that of
money toward art.
That morning he spied at Gougil's a
photograph of moderate dimensions, a
landscape signed by a former fellow
student of his, Victor Forsythe. Their
friendship had continued, but pallidly
and intermittently. Forsythe had mar
ried; the wife was said to be a very nice
girl, but not at all of the smart set. In
graham had sent a rather expensive
wedding gift and had meant to pay a
visit. Then he heard that the Forsythes
were out of town for the summer. Evi
dently the artist had profited by his
vacation; the photograph from his
painting showed a work of rare
quality. It was a riverside meadow,
with a clump of willows; the stream
had shadowy depths and luminous ed
dies; some sheep were pasturing in the
foreground. Nothing could be more
simple and serene than this idyllic
landscape-yet Ingrahamn's first impres
sion was of something grandiose. After
a moment this quality disappearo";
but if he turned away his gaze and
then looked afresh at the picture it al
ways made the same effect upon him.
He decided that it was something about
the backlground; there were vague,
large curves, perhaps of clouds or of
distant hills; at all event, they were
extraordinarily imposing in their faint
and tenuous suggestions of immensity.
"There is one vulgar consolation re
served for the bondholder," said Ingra
ham humbly to himself. "He can buy
what pleases him and at the same time
encourage art."
He at once decided to lunch at an
Italian restaurant frequented by the
painter clique who liked to recall the
impressions of a sketching tour that
they had once made in a body to Rome
and to talk of the coloring of the great
SA ] Q A A A
lIE SAW rOR8XTIE QUIT3 ALLONE AT A TAELE.
Campagna, the unspeakable grandeur
of the ruins, the good taste of the
wines of the country, which they
drank under the vine trellises of a lit
tle osteria. As Ingraham entered the
restaurant he saw Forsythe quite alone
at a table. lie crossed the room and
greeted him.
"If you are not expecting anyone,
Forsythe, will you lunch with me?
This is rather like sora Clelia's, isn't
it?"
"A fair imitation. But we miss the
fellow with the guitar and worthy old
Clelia, who would sometimes bring a
dish with her own hands in order to
say to us 'good appetite, my children' "'
"Ah! the dear old sora Clelia!"
They mingled reminiscences until it
appeared to Ingraham that it would
not be an impertinence on his part to
begin to talk about the painting that
he wished to buy.
"Forsythe," he said, "I have just
seen at Goupil's the photograph of a
most remarkable picture of yours. It
is wonderful, beyond praise. You have
struck a new manner, and your first
manner was the despair of the rest of
us. But this landscape is great. Let
me say plainly, and get over the crude
ness of the situation, that I want to
buy the original. They said at Gou
pil's that they had not seen it, and did
not know whether it was sold or not.
If it is I shall try to get it away from
its present owner. I must have it at
any price."
"I am glad that you like the paint
ing. But the original is not for sale."
"Indeed, 1 cannot wonder that you
are in love with it yourself, and wish
to keep it. But could you let me have
a replica?"
"Possibly."
"YeT we l4 hove 39 objee0t6 to
copying it for me on another eanvas?"
*'As you say."
Ingraham drew out his check book,
signed a page, tore it of$ and handed it
to Forsythe.
"Oh. carte blanche is too much," pro
tested the artist.
"Too little, by Jove! I want that
landscape. I have ordered one of the
photographs framed and sent to my
rooms; but, of course, it must lack the
touch and the colors of the real thing
-the silvery green of the willows, the
olive depths and the amber lights of
the water, the blue of the marsh lilies
and of the heavens above them-"
"'1 painted it in monochrome."
"But you hit the values marvelously.
What was the tint?"
" 'Well, a kind of reddish brown."
"Not sepia?"
"No. "
"Burnt sienna?"
"Not exactly."
"lUmber?"
"Well, hardly."
"All right, the coloring is your little
secret. But I have not yet spoken of
the real wonder of your work, For
sythe. Willows and streams and sheep
feeding have been seen before now.
But there's more to it than that. You
have painted in there some great dim
curves. They are more than haman;
they are titanic, as if you had seen for
one inspired moment the great earth
mother herself behind her creation
something, as Swinburne says: 'The
solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep.'
I am bound to admit, however, that
now you see it and now you don't,"
noted the rich man. ashamed to be
caught in a rapturous citation of poe
try. "Anyhow, Forsythe, that picture
is like a glimpse into the morning of
the world, the primeval myths."
Whereupon the artist laughed gayly,
filled out the check with very moder
ate figures and handed it back to In
graham- .
"You shall have the replica, my dear
fellow: but I don't take 'the money be
forehand. Thank you for all the nice
things you have been saying. But,
upon my word, I'm not responsible for
the titanic curves. They were aeci
dental-no, not that,either -incidental.
They were, in fact, caused by the par
ticular canvas, so to speak."
"Nonsense, that cannot be so. How
ever, to content you, I will admit that
you painted better than you knew."
"Yes; that picture was the result of
the habit of handling a brush. Neither
more nor less."
"Forsythe, you used not to have
these little affectations. Don't try to
make me believe that a man can paint
like that without a real inspiration.
You divined, you saw that prodigiour
curve, as of a colossal beautiful shoul
der. It may have been originally a
mountain or a cloud; but you have
softeied and made it mysterious-a
thing to worship."
"Come, no, I will tell you all about
it, because it will really not do for you
to keep on raving about a stroke of
non-existent genius. WVell, this was the
way of it. 'Mrs. Forsythe and I went
away for our wedding trip as far as
the state of Maine. We visited the
great lakes-which they modestly call
ponds there-we plunged into the pine
wilderness and turned up among the
too compendious scenery and civiliza
tion of 'Mount Desert. At the end of
our vacation we stayed a few days in
the city of Portland, and while there
we made a little excursion in a horse
car to a pretty village with an old
English name. The conductor was
friedly, and advised us to walk along
a road until we should come to a mill
dam; there we should find a little
steamer ready to take us three miles
upstream to the log boom.
"The place was charming. It had an
air of exquisite remoteness. Of course,
a highroad, houses, a milldam, a
steamer and various smart canoes
near a boathouse seemed to testify to
the neighborhood of human beings.
But the stream and its shores, lovely
bits of level meadow with shady copses
of willow and alder, the complete still
ness, except for the impertinent puff
ing of the little launch, were like a
a virgin country. My wife and I
wished to enjoy it to perfection, so we
disembarked at the log-boom and told
the captain of the steamer that we
would wrat over n trip. 89 enswered
that if we came again to the boom
within an hour and forty minutes that
would connect with his boat and with
the car back to the city. So my wife
and I strayed over the meadows and
wished that we had brought the
sketching outfit, and then sat down on
the grass and made all sorts of plans
for our future."
"'And the majesty of the distant
mountains slowly impressed itself upon
you as they loomed in the sack
ground?"
"Not at all. I do not think that there
were any hills in sight. We were so
engrossed that we did not notice the
uprising of a bank of threatening
clouds"
"Ah, I see! It was their outlines"
"Outlines nothing! It was their
wetness, their profuse, inopportune,
wrung-out- from-all- the-sponges-of-the
sky wetness! In a moment we were
soaked, our shoes squelched, the color
of the blue cornflowers in my wife's
hat dripped down upon her neck. We
were a sight to see.- I fancy that the
captain of the launch thought of our
plight and made all haste to rescue us
-but the time seemed long to us.
However, we tried to take it as a joke.
But the jocularity ceased the next day,
when my wife developed a case of acute
bronchitis. A physician was called,
who pronounced it a trifle, if treated
promptly. He prescribed a mixture
for the cough, and told me to paint
her back, between the shoulders, with
iodine.
"So with a phial of tincture of iodine
and a small camel's hair brush I set to
work. My anxiety for her was re
lieved, the impression of the beautiful
solitary landscape that we had seen
was fixed upon my mental retina-and,
first that I knew, I was painting that
scene in iodine monochrome on the
shoulders of my patient! I declare to
you, Ingrahlam, 1 had completely for
gotten that I was not painting on can
vas. instead of a human surface, like
'chicken skin, delicate, white,' as Aus
tin Dobson sings of the Pompadour's
fan. My. wife wonaeriug at the length
of the application, at last inquired:
'But have you not almost finished. Vic-
tor?' And I, still oblivious, replied:
'A few more touches, and it will be
ready to frame.' She gave a funny
little hoarse shout of Inughter-nmy
wife had a sense of humor. Then I,
too, saw the joke. She ran to the
dressing table, and, by means of a
hand-mirror, surveyed her shoulders.
'Why, this is a lovely landscapel' she
said. 'It is too good to lose. Find
my kodak, Victor, it is in one of the
trunks, and photograph your master
piece before it begins to fade out.' She
was delighted; the iodine and the fun
together soon cured her cold, so that
in a few days we came home to New
York.
"Of course I had the photograph en
larged, and it succeeded so well that I
placed a few copies in Goupil's, hoping
that some of my friends would like
them. The original painting has long
since disappeared; I shall make your
replica from the photograph. And I
shall try to recall the silvery greens
and the somber olive-browns which
you rightly attributed to the land
Acape."
"But all this does not account
for those grandoise, superhuman
curves, the visible presence of the
earth-goddess."
"Ah, I rubbed down the outlines all
that I could. But it is not easy to ob
literate in a photograph. Those curves
--I told you they were owing to the
shape of the canvas. My wife's shoul
ders, of course, came out large in pro
portion to the landscape painted on
them. She is not titanic, nor even,
perhaps, a goddess. But she is an ex
tra nice little woman, all the same."
HE HATED WOMEN.
Bachelor of Vienna Used to Buy Three
Seats at the Theater.
There are so many sham misogynists
about in this affectedly cynical age
that one can irdly help extending a
measure of admiration to the thorough
ness and consistency of a certain rich
old Viennese bachelor, whose death
was announced the other day.
In the case of this highly eccentric
old gentleman, horror and dread of our
unfortunate sex had become a positive
mania, for it is recorded of him that
whenever he went to a place of public
entertainment he took the precaution
of booking three seats, in the center
one of which he seated himself, leaving
those on each side vacant, so as to
avoid all risk of being obliged to sit
next to a woman!
lHe even carried his extraordinary
craze beyond the grave, by leaving in
structions that no woman was to be
buried either to the right or left of
him, even if it should be necessary to
purchase three graves in order to in
sure the carrying out of his strange
behest.
Perhaps the most curious thing in
the whole strange story is the state
ment that this agreeable old gentle
man left behind hlim a large bundle of
letters, which he had grimly indorsed:
"Attempts made by my family to put
me under the yoke of matrimony."
As he appears to have been a very
wealthy man, this alleged action on
the part of his relatives seems by no
means easy to explain.--Lady's Pic

AN EMERGENCY DRAWER.
A Vsetw -s.alagr Thatt Should Hlave a rtile
Ina Every Ilouselhol.
Every househould should have a
fixed place devoted to simple remedies
for the trivial accidents which ofter
become such serious affairs through
neglect. Burns, scalds, cuts and bruises
are of nearly daily occurrence, and
their frequency as well as painfulness
demands a little forethought toward
their alleviation.
Tile emergency drawer is designed to
fill this need. It should be stout and
steady, with no tendency to stick fast
when least expected, and well out of
reach of little prying fingers. It
should also be located somewhere in
the kitchen, as oftentimes a wound is
neglected rather than run upstairs for
assistance.
The remedy always on hand should
be earron oil (equal parts of lime water
and lineced oil), common baking soda,
arnica, a salve, anti-septic gauze, to
gether with absorbent cotton, old linen,
cheesecloth bandages and a pair of
scissors. Carron oil is a sovereign rem
edy for burns and scalds, and should
always be on hand; baking soda is an
other very good remedy, and in burns
from hot lard will often give relief
much sooner than the oil. It is used
either dry or made into a strong solu
tion with water.
Anti-septic gauze is useful in case of
cuts. After washing thoroughly to re
move any foreign substance, draw the
edges firmly together and cover neatly
with the gauze. Mhlve is for slight
burns, etc.. and serves merely to ex
clude the air from the tender surface.
Aborbent cotton can be used for
burns and scalds serious enough to
need bandaging, and should be kept in
place by cheesecloth bandages. These
can be purchased by the roll, but are
easily made. A couple of yards of
cheesecloth are torn into two-inch
lengthwise strips, and rolled up.
When needed, cut off the desired length
and slit one end up to within about sir
inches of the other end. This is the
physicians' niethod of bandaging, and
not only has the advantage of not slip
ping readily, but does away with the
unsightly cords most women tie over a
bandage.
Other simple remedies may also g.

medicine from a reliable doctor, flan
nel bands, a hot water bottle, small
syringe and castile soap, good sweet
oil for physic, bottle of soda mint and
a small collection of the teas which
old-fashioned nurses cling to. The
small expenditure of time and money
necessary to equip these emergency
drawers will be repaid a hundred-fold
in many cases where time is a valuable
factor in cures.-Detroit Free Press.
WOMAN IN POLITICS.
81he May be lnexperlenced, itat She Can
Turn a Trick Now and Then.
The session of the legislature in every
state brings to the capital a retinue of
applicants for every position. This
year there has been an unusually large
number of people out of work. In one
of the western drought-stricken states,
where the number of employes for the
sixty days' session had been limited by
law to two hundred, there were no less
than two thousand five.hundred needy
applicant.,
The day before the opening of the
session a shy girl knocked at the door
of the attorney-general's office.
"Is the attorney-general in?" she
asked, timidly.
"Yes," said the clerk. "lie will see
you when lie gets through with this
long line of job hunters. Just have a
seat."
In the numerous chairs, on the office
lounge, and standing, were twenty or
more waiting for a turn to press some
claim for a position.
The attorney-general was rather a
gruff-looking man, and he dismissed
each with tho remark: "I can't do
anything for you. Sorry, you know,
but there are hundreds of applicants,
and each officer, every legislator, has
a dozen begging for each position."
When the timid girl's turn came, she
handed the impatient-looking officer a
letter. She said nothing, she hardly
looked into his face.
"I'm sorry, Miss C., that I can do
nothing for you. It was foolish for
you to come here, expecting to get
work. I'd be glad to help you if I
could, but, you see, it's this way. I
have no influence to get you a position.
I am very-"
"We were speaking of that at home,
but I'thought it would do no harm to
see you," she interrupted. "And we
were saying what a pity it was that
you had lost your influence."
The state official winced. lie looked
as if something hurt him.
"Brown," Ie said, turning to his
deputy with unnecessary abruptness,
"this young lady is to have a position
in the enrollng department. See that
there is a place for her if you have to
muzzle every legislator in the build
ing."-N. Y. Herald.

came a Prussian university. The em
peror has hitherto opposed the admis

the beginning of further concessions

LOADING AN OCEAN STEAMER.
The Storage in Sanerthing Tremendousc
and Requires UCareful Packing.
To watch the loading of grain, either
from an elevator or a. lighter, into one
of the manmmnoth vessels engaged in
its transportation, is to witness one of
the chief operations in the movement
of the world's commerce. It is carried
in long pipes, with a funnel-shaped
movable appendage at the end, which
is shifted by means of a rope from one
part of the hold to another, according
as the streamn of grain fills nip the
spaces reserved for it. The grain thows
into the vessel with the noise and
velocity of a torrent., and senls a
dense volume of dust and chalf up
ward, obscuring the deptlhs beneath
and malting the men attending the
stowage below look like gihosts in the
rising mist.
The "trimmning" of the grain in the
holds is ain inmportant part of its stovw
age. After several thousand bushels
have streamedl into thIe hold, a dozen
or inore nmen are delegated to shovel
tile downpouring colunmn in between
the vessel's beams, a job for which they
are paid at. the rate of one cent a mnin
ute. In vessels of the Cunard stripe it
takes between 12,4100 and 15,00.O0 busiel s
to fill a hold, and these vessels average
n0,000 bushels in thie total cargo. Ships
carrying grain alone can take as hiighi
as 125,000 bushels, and when it is con
sidered that from 4,000 to 7,000 bushels
can he stored in an Ihour, every forty
bushels weighing a ton, an idea can be
had of the force Of thie torrent directed
into the vessel.
Large vessels have four or five holdls,
and a distinction is made in storing the
cargo in them. Grain. from its com
pact and dead weight, is reserved
mostly for the center of the vessel,
while cured provisions are packed as
far forward and as far aft as possible,
for their better preservatton from tl.e
heat of the ship's fires. In some ves
sels, like the great Cunarders, which
carry passengers as well as freight,
the heaviest weight is stored in tIhe
lowest hold; this is to steady thie ves
sel and is called in the technical par
lance of the stevedore, "stiffenirg" the
ship. It talres about one thousand and
five hundred tons to "stiffen" a great
Cunarder. and when this is done the

A boy canme running up the street to
the hotel and announced that they
were going to lynch a man on the pubi
lip square, and so we cut the dinner
short and went over. There was a
crowd of about forty rough-looking
men. most of them from the Blue Ridge
mountains, and in the miest of them
was an "Indian doctor" who was sell
ing a liver mnedicine. They had a rope
around his neck, and though he
looked rather pale. he hadn't lost any
of his cheek. The landlord was a
leading man in town, and as he made
his way into the crowd and asked
what was up an old mountaineer with
hair two feet long replied for the
crowd:
"We ar' jest a-gwine to hang him,
Bill-that's all!"
"W'-hat yo' gwine to hang him fur?"
queried the landlord.
"Fnor lyin' and deceivin'. Down at
Bristol, fo' weeks ago, him sold me a
bottle of this stuff, and it laid me in
bed fur two weeks. It was jest the
same with five or six others."
"llev you got anything to se.?" was
asked of the "doctor," who was calmly
surveying the crowd around him.
"I hev," he replied. "I am charged
with lyin' and decivin'. I deny it.
Yere is a medicine that acts directly
on the liver. It's purely vegetable. It
was discovered by To. Va-iLe, the cele
brated Sioux chief, and I have been of
fered one thousand dollars for the se
cret of it. 1ly friend here says he
bought a bottle fur his liver and it
made hli Il sick."
"lMighty nigh killed me, it did!" said
the old man.
"Yo' bought it fur yo'r liver, didn't
yo'?"
"I did."
"But it didn't act on yo'r liver. Why
not? Let's investigate a little. 11ev yo'
got a liver?"
"In co'se I hey! What sort of a var
mint do yo' take inc fur!"
"If yo' hey a liver please tell us wham'
it's located?"
"\Vhy, it's-it's-why-why-!"
lBut he couldn't te'll. lie looked
around in a dazed and helpless way,
and the crowd began to la~ugh.
"Kin any man in this c'rowd locate
his liver?" asked the fakir. '
No one cared to try it, and after a
look around the man continued:
"I'm sellin' a liver medicine. If !
sell to a man who hasn't got a live,'
the medicine naturally begins to worb,
on his kidneys or lungs or spleen, an:
in jures instead of benefits him. Ain .
expected to know who has a liver an4
who hasn't? Kin I go marchin' up and
down this broad commonwealth asking
every one I meet if he's provided with
a liver? Of course not! I must takea
it fur granted that all of yo' are pro
vided fur, and that thur is a basis fur
umy remedy to work on. Am I to be
hung for that?"
"Nt,!" No!" shouted a dozen voices,
and five minutes later the "doctor" .
was passing out the dollar-bottles with
one hand and taking in the dollar-bills
with the other and saying to the peo
ple:
"lDon't git onduly excited, good
folks: This yere is a liver medicine.
If yo' hain't got no liver it won't do
yo' a daurned bit of good. lie sure yo'
ar' right and then come for'd and git
the only purely vegetable remedy ever
bestowed upon makind as a boon!"

Sa ngel child. lie is, in fact, the ter

his father ionughit him a bicycle and
Rlobbie was more an object of dread to

was detected in some particularly out
rageous act, and his father, to punish
him, forbade him to ride the bicycle
for a whole week. Robbie promised,
but as his father neared the honie
next day he saw his son whirling along
on the wheel.
"Robibie," said lie, more in sorrow
than in anger, "didn't I tell you you
were not to ride your wheel for a
week ?"
"Yes, sir," said Robbie, cheerfully,
"and I'm not going to disobey you.
This isn't my wheel. It's one I bor
rowed. "--ashington Post.
