VOLUME 1, NUMBER 22
Crucial and Timely Task Faces Nation
IS ST. PAUL MAYOR A WOOL-SPINNER?
Capital City Citizens Will Not Be Led Astray
By Any Pre-Election Shakeups.
By “Twilight”
St. Paul, Minn.—While St. Paul is
having a mild winter, Red Wing has
Sommer. Mayor Nelson swung into
action after some “fiddling” and did
that which certainly was a step in
the right direction, when he demand
ed the resignation of the Chief of
Police, Mr. Sommer. There was
nothing for the chief to do when he
received the order from his superior,
but sit down and pound out the “res
ignation,” and he did it. Captain
Gebhardt is now serving as tempo
rary Chief of Police. No action, so
far as the public knows, has been
taken, in the appointment of a new
Chief of Police. It is rumored that
the next Police Chief will be selected
from within the Police Department.
Many seem to think that Captain
Gebhardt will serve as Chief of Po
lice until after the coming municipal
election, pointing out a political ma
neuver in the ousting of Mr. Sommer.
However, the longer Mr. Sudheimer
delays the appointment of a chief,
the more the whole police shakeup
will look like a pre-election move.
We should watch the appointment,
or rather, the delayed appointment of
a new Chief of Police with concern,
for political hesitations tell a long
story wonderfully well.
Mayor’s Action is Only a Step.
I stated that Mayor Nelson made
a step in the right direction when he
eaused a stampede in the Central
Police Station. I used the word
“step” advisedly. The Mayor’s action
is only a step. The public is not go
ing to accept the “resignation” of
Chief Sommer as conclusive proof
that all will be well in St. Paul from
now on. There is much work ahead
for the Mayor and Commission Sud
heimer, in so far as the St. Paul Po
lice Department is concerned. One
card has been played on the public
table and the others should be forth
coming without much delay. These
days public officials are continually
getting themselves in a “mellova
hess” by merely bluffing. The pub
lic is now strong on “show-downs”
and each day getting more inclined
to take official outbursts with several
grains of salt, especially when they
come “just before election, mother.”
The Mayor’s recent activity looks
good, but then so does a shoddy suit
of clothes—ten feet away. Mayor
Nelson has the opportunity of a life
time to impress himself indelibly
upon Minnesota people as a fearless
advocate of righteousness, but will
he be big enough to take advantage
of the door that is open unto him?
The question lingers, and a negative
answer comes forward more fre
quently than the positive.
“Politics is Politics in St. Paul”
A man said to me the other day
that “politics is politics in St. Paul,
and must be played according to
side rules or the ‘bump’ is delivered
fast and furiously.” He did not
state who made the “inside” rules or
did the “bumping” but then, having
had considerable experience in politi
cal affairs, I accepted the possibility
of a St. Paul political ring and let it
go at that. Machine politics and po
litical rings are not new in America.
Is there a man of mental weight in
the city of St. Paul who can truth
fully stand on both feet and say, with
a ring of sincerity, that the Saintly
City has nbt had more than its share
of inside politics and political gang
sters. There is a persistent rumor
moving along the streets of the Cap
ital City which points to the removal
of Chief Sommer as a direct result
of Mr. Sommer’s refusal to divide
alleged police graft. Understand, it
is only a rumor and rumors are curi
ous creatures, with no definite source
and therefore hard to run down and
establish as truth.
Troubles Lie Deep.
Any St. Paul Mayor who comes out
fearlessly for what is right will have
one merry time from the moment he
takes his oath of office until he picks
up his personal belongings in his pri
vate office, where he presided for a
time as Chief Executive of the mu
nicipality. Mayor Nelson' showed
some real spunk recently, but that
one flareup is not Efficient to justify
unquestioned support. All govern
mental troubles lie deeper than the
surface and involve more than one
man. In order to accomplish any
thing near a real city-wide cleanup,

it will be necessary to penetrate to
the roots and there locate the crea
tures which wax fat on political
spoils and official inefficiency. One
volley does not win a battle or even
serve as proof that advances will be
made directly into the camp of the
ringsters. If the Mayor thinks that
the shortcomings of the police de
partment of Mr. Sommer’s tenure of
office will be corrected merely by the
appointment of a new Chief of Police,
he is mistaken, for it is becoming
more evident each day that conditions
in the police department came to pass
due to underlying situations. The
average policeman will do his duty,
providing he is given half a chance
and made to clearly understand that
he will be held responsible in each
and every case of lawlessness that is
not properly managed by him when
it is his duty to be active.
When Public Opinion is Aroused
Whenever the light of publicity re
veals a “rotten condition” in society,
and public opinion gets aroused to
the point of placing responsibility
where it belongs, and furthermore,
demands immediate action for rem
edy, then we get reaction from cer
tain public officials whose voices be
come so important that their state
ments have to be printed on the
front page in big type. Their lan
guage is broadcasted o’er the land,
rich in promise, loud in assertiveness,
respecting “What Is About to Be
Acomplished.” The public is tempo
rarily appeased, the voice of promise
grows fainter, echoes take the place
of assertions, and not until we get
another “Revelation of Rottenness”
do we get any more important state
ments in big type, concerning “What
Is About to Be Accomplished.”
The whole thing is ? splendid piece
of “Municipal Comedy” and would
not be half bad as a joke, if the ef
fects of such stage-play were not so
tragic.
Statements! Statements! Statements!
A mere collection of statements
which have been made by prominent
public officials in St. Paul, in connec
tion with promised action on well
established evils these past few years
should at least produce a laugh, or
a feeling of disgust (the former is
the better thing; because a person
does save his own disposition by
laughter; and why waste a good piece
of disgust on comedy?) In the
midst of the law enforcement atmoe
phere that now hangs over St. Paul,
we should be getting something very
specific before very long. High
sounding promises of fullest co-oper
ation and unreserved support, to
carry out a splendid program of law
enforcement availeth nothing. If the
average citizen of St. Paul would
just keep on file the number of
“threatened and promised investiga
tions” which never investigate, the
number of “cleanups and cleanouts”
which fail to clean anything; the
number of campaigns which have
stayed in camp; the number of
pledges which outstanding public offi
cials have made and failed to fulfill,
the number of plans submitted in
public (and frustrated or smashed in
private) before they were worked,
such citizens would have some things
to laugh at; and furthermore, such
citizens would know when it was
time to laugh again, because the
“high sounders” can always be heard
whenever suitable public psychology
requires their votes, and they are
ever ready to act, if only the lime
light will fall upon them, their or
ganization, their word, their promi
nence, their power, but not their
work.
It is unfortunate for such “Munic
ipal Comedy” that there are enough
folks left who catch on to its humor
and the ballot box is available as a
means for ringing down the curtain
on too much farce, and upon such
players whose guise is one of either
fooling with or misusing a public
office; and if the job be an appointive
one rather than an elective one, then
public opinion ultimately becomes
stronger than limelight, and the in
sincere or dishonest official receives
his justifiable darkness by expulsion
from public confidence and eventually
from public position, with discredit.
Abraham Lincoln’s reputed phrase
on fooling the people—a part, some,
or all the time—is still ingrained in
The Ballot Box is Available
“Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty**
ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1923
American thinking and works out in
the same prophetic way that that im
mortal character declared it would.
Pity of it is that some moderns as
sume they are clever enough to beat
the logic of the rail-splitter’s theory,
and they figure not on the laughter
that is caused by “Municipal Com
edy” and the vote of them who laugh
at the farce.
The people of St. Paul are think
ing, perhaps as never before, along
the lines of better government and
are determined as never before to
have better government. Individuals
that stand in the way will be politely
pushed aside and made to understand
that nothing but honest, fearless and
sincere actions will be tolerated. The
state of mind of the average Saint
Paulite is observed by professional
politicians with spinal tremblings.
Like a “kid” being chased by a “cop,”
the politician nervously looks in every
direction, wondering what course to
take.
Mayor Nelson has made a belated
effort to accomplish something worth
while. We don’t want to draw er
roneous conclusions from hesitations
and uncertain, wavering steps for
ward. We urge, therefore, that all
voters of St. Paul scrutinize official
activities with unusual care and re
main constantly alert so that a clear
understanding of what’s what may
guide them in casting their ballot
at the next municipal election.

a Statement
—K-K-K
Washington, D. C.—The protest
papers against the election of Sen
ator Mayfield of Texas, were laid be
fore yesterday by Senator
Cummins, president pro tempore.
The case was referred to the Senate
committee on privileges and elections.
Washington, D. C.—Senator Earle
B. Mayfield, Democrat of Texas, has
broken the silence he hag maintained
since he assumed office, and an
nounced definitely that he is prepared
to fight any attempt to oust him.
“I am here,” Senator Mayfield as
serted. “I was duly and legally
elected senator from Texas by a ma
jority of 137,000 votes. No move is
up to me now. I intend to continue
to serve, to the best of my ability,
the interests of the people who elect
ed me.
“I filed a detailed statement of my
campaign expenses with the secre
tary of state of Texas according to
law,” Senator Mayfield said. “That
record will speak for itself.”
Strong Lobby Present
Senator Mayfield refused to dis
cuss any details of the battle which,
is brewing behind the scenes in the
Senate to unseat him. His oppo
nents in Texas have sent a delega
tion of lawyers, politicians and prop
agandists to Washington to under
take the fight. They have rented
headquarters in a Washington hotel
where daily conferences are' held.
There are a few Republicans mixed
up in the scrap as well as Texas
Democrats.
The filing of the protest against
Mayfield with the privilege? and elec
tions committee of the Senate will be
the signal for an open clash in the
Senate.
The first move in the fight to oust
Mayfield was made in the closing
days of the last session, nearly a
year ago, when a formal protest was
filed with the secretary of the Senate.
The protest wag based primarily on
charges that Mayfield had spent more
than the *IO,OOO permitted under the
law and that the Ku Klux Elan had
provided the money.
Senator Mayfield asserts that in
more than 130 campaign speeches in
Texas he did not once mention or
recognize the Elan. It is asserted
that Ferguson is the man who raised
the Elan issue.

—K-K-K '
Baltimore, Md.—The Klan circus
for the benefit of the" charity fund
was held here December 8 to 15 in
Hazazer’s hall, despite the fact that
certain officials, spurred on by pro
qliens, attempted to thwart the plans
of the Klansmen fey' refusing them
the use of the Fourth Regiment Ar
mory at the last foment before the
circus was scheduled to be held.
All arrangements for the circus
had been made, at nouqcements post
ed, when members of the Maryland
Armory commission, composed of
Governor Albert C. Ritchie, Adjutant
General Reckford. and Comptroller
Gerdy, declared the Armory could
not he used by the Ku Klux Klan for
a charity fund circus. •
A legal battle is in progress to de
termine the extent of the authority
of the Armory commission in such a
matter, but the Klan circus was not
postponed because of it. The circus
was crowded every evening, and a
large sum was realized, the money to
be devoted to the philanthropic proj
ects of the Klan of Baltimore.
Opposition to the Klan charity cir
cus was raised by Archbishop Cur
ley. Failure to stop the circus dis
gruntled the archbishop and his fol
lowers because they had openly boast
ed that the show would not be held.

New York.—Tammany Hall has its
grip on Theodore Roosevelt. It is
undenied here that he will be the
candidate of that Catholic political
organization for governor of this
state.
His candidacy and exposure of po
litical alignments is more proof that
Tammany Hall will try to force Al
cohol Smith down the necks of the
Democratic party .at the presidential
convention.
In the face oT an opposition that
already is solid against Smith, Tam
many will make a vain fight to place
him in nomination. Failing in this
it is figured he will make good trad
ing stock for a compromise candi
date.
In the meantime > Roosevelt will be
groomed to take. Smith’s place in the
governor’s chair so that Tammany
will not lose its hold on the state if
it is unable to get a Catholic strangle
hold on the naiiea.
Roosevelt, a Protestant, is made
the tool.

Writer of Fake Letter Forges Klan
Signature—Malicious Document
Attracts Attention of Po6t
Office Department.
—K-K-K
Pipestone, Minn.—Another case of
forgery has just been reported in
which a Pipestone party signs Ku
Klux Klan to a fake letter sent to an
enemy of bootleggers and booze.
This letter, which was sent through
the mail, has been reported, and op
eratives are at work tracing the
sender.
In this letter, written by one not
too well versed in the English lang
uage, an abusive tone was taken,
charging this leader with manufac
turing liquor himself and stating that
if he did not discontinue his talk
against them, the poison manufac
turers, they would run him out of
town. This letter was signed with
the letters K. K. K. Such contempt
ible practices must and will be stop
ped. As far as we know, this man
(not a Klansman) is one of the high
est type, a leader in one of Pipe
stone’s churches; and the people of
Pipestone should not allow such
contemptible things to continue.
The Pipestone KKK has stood a
lot of this kind of cowardly work by
anti-Klan forces, without saying
much; but this last letter was the
“straw that broke the camel’s back.”
We are out after a hide, and we are
going to get it. We will prosecute
to the fullest extent of the law.
To the party who sent this letter,
let us say that now is a good time
to make a clean breast of this matter
and apologize to the man whose
character they tried to besmirch.
Remember—anyone receiving such
letters has the backing of the Klan.
'Protestants Who Refuse to Aid
Church in Minneapolis Are
Victims.
$175,000 Is OBTAINED BY FAIRS
United States Mails Used Unlawfully
In Drive for Cash.
Minneapolis.—Roman Catholics of
this city are freely dispensing their
threats of the festive “boycott” to all
Protestant merchants who decline to
stand and deliver contributions to the
many Roman Catholic bazaars and
other contrivances by which they en
deavor to bring Protestant financial
support to the church. From one to
three canvasses of every business dis
trict is made and merchants are told
point blank on refusal to contribute
that they will be boycotted.
The people, however, are respond
ing to the situation in a way that the
R. C.’s have not counted upon. When
ever it becomes known that a mer
chant is under the ban of the church,
Protestants are warned with the re
sult that their patronage usually
counterbalances the loss of Catholic
business to such an extent that in
creased rather than decreased busi
ness results.
Gambling Devices.
The numerous events and schemes
to bring money into the church’s cof
fers has become such a nuisance as
to become a public scandal.
A careful estimate of the revenue
derived from the fairs, bazaars,
games of chance contrary to law, and
other money-getting enterprises fos
tered by th?e church officials, indicates
that not less than $175,000 has been
gathered in, the larger part of which,
it is said, was contributed by Pro
testants.
Investigation Looms.
It is understood the use of the Gov-
emment mails to advance schemes
regarded as unlawful, has attracte:
the attention of the postal authori
ties, and as a result thereof there
may result an investigation which is
not likely to redound to the credit
of the church authorities.
Their tacit consent to irregularities
may be assumed, otherwise laymen of
the Catholic church would not have
the temerity to do things contrary to
priestly will.

Says Writer--“ Right of Representa

A Spoils System Has Developed
Which Is Inherently Vicious
Small Group Dominates Legislative
Procedure—Klan Lays Down Pro
gram for Constructive Reform
Washington, D. C.—ln all the his
tory of the United States there have
not been more than a dozen military
engagements comparable in public
importance to the parliamentary bat
tle that marked the opening of the
present Congress. It was not spec
tacular, as a great martial conflict
would have been, but the issues in
volved had a direct, definite and vital
relationship to the very fundamentals
of American institutions.
The most crucial and timely task
facing this nation is to get “back to
the Constitution.” That must be
done if our democracy is to endure.
It was the spirit and the purpose of
the basic law that the federal legis
lative machinery should be estab
lished and maintained upon the rep
resentative principle. It was meant
to express the popular will, to act
out in the open, to be free of auto
cratic or oligarchal influences, to
function as a deliberative body. All
that has been perverted—and pros
tituted to the selfish aims and ends
of politics. The national legislature
has become both the product and the
exponent of a new kind of ruling
caste power to such an extent that
it is now a mockery, a menace to
American traditions.
A spoils system has developed
which is inherently vicious.
Through parliamentary devices
wholly within their control, a few
bosses are dominant throughout the
legislative procedure.
If a little handful of these self
selected congressional “leaders” were
personally to appoint three or four
hundred of their fellow members, in
accordance with the bought-and-paid
for practice of modern American pol
itics, their subsequent control of
Congress would hardly be more com
plete than is their present power,
based upon parliamentary perver
sions.
Bossism is repulsive to true Ameri-
camsm.
The small group of Progressives
who had the balance of power, and
thus temporarily blocked the Old
Guard organization of the House of
Representatives, were fighting boss
ism. For so doing they have been
branded as “radicals;” but there was
nothing radical nor revolutionary in
their attitude. They demanded a re
constructive alteration of the rules
to restore representaive functioning.
What they advocated was a getting
“back to the Constitution.” The real
radicals, the dangerous kind, are
those responsible for the building of
a sinister, secret, boss system, and
who now insist upon its retention in
their hands.
What They Are Fighting
The enemies and distorters of the
Constitution within Congress, those
who perhaps unknowingly pervert
its principles, have a parliamentary
system, bssed upon un-American
foundation-, such as these:
1. Unofficial agencies, like the se
cret caucus and the “steering com
mittee,” which are purely political
instrumentalities, not responsible to
nor in any way connected with con
stitutionally established authority.
Their very existence is a confession
of spoils purposes, predicated upon
the ascendency of politics over pub
lic service.
The closed caucus sires a whole
brood of evil institutions and vicious
influences. It is both creator and
creature of the “organization.”
Whenever the politicians are driven
to that extremity, it virtually be
comes the House itself, making abor
tive every vital safeguard, from pub
licity to majority rule. It sets up
the “committee on committees,”
which in turn does the organizing.
It approves the speaker and other
elective officials, making a farce of
subsequent and more open proceed
ings in that field. Seniority, some
times fittingly called senility, i« its
favorite offspring.
2. Through seniority, the “organ
ization” and its unconstitutional
methods are practically self-perpetu
ating. Seniority means that a mem
ber once given a position by and in
the organization shall never be de-
?2.00 A YEAR. 5c A COPY
posed; on the contrary, his advance
to more preferred prominence be
comes inevitable. Seniority makes it
a continuous performance, through
one Congress into its successor. As
in the case of a great fortune, there
is an entailment of parliamentary
power, with an ever-increasing un
earned increment of spoils and per
versions.
3. Obstructive Powers. The stand
ing committee is the cornerstone of
the system. These committees are
organized upon a basis of spoils
rather than efficiency. There are
sixty of the, fully half of which
serve no useful purpose save that of
beings pegs upon which to hang priv
iliges and perquisites. Their person
nel is shaped by seniority. Once
they are “packed” by Old Guard ad
herents, and commanded by organi
zation chairmen, under existing rules,
the reactionary “leaders” have a con
trol that cannot be broken.
Majority Becomes “Minority”
Even a majority of the membership
cannot reach into the pigeonholes
of a standing committee and bring a
measure into the open. Of course,
there is a parliamentary contrivance
intended to remedy this vicious con
dition, but it was so jokered as to be
worthless.
The power to obstruct becomes
finally the power to legislate. That
is the most dangerous aspect of the
whole parliamentary situation.
It is unbelievable, yet literally
true, that there is practically no such
thing as regular, orderly, routine
procedure on any important public
measure. To be acted upon at all,
a bill has first to attain a priviledged
status, either through regular or spe
cial rules. This means in almost
every case that the bosses have the
right of way as to control of time,
debate and amendments.
In short, the House of Represent
atives of the American nation is to
day as far removed from true delib
eration and real representative func
tioning as any parliamentary body
on the face of the earth. A few
bosses are Congress. The average
member is a dummy, alost as effec
tually disfranchised as though never
elected. Because of his position, he
may to some extent influence public
opinion, but, except on unusual oc
casions, neither by voice nor vote can
he directly and vitally exercise his
constitutional rights as a represent
ative of the people.
Insurgency and Partyism
When this session began, for the
first time since the fiasco over Can
nonism, there was in the House of
Representatives a group of Propres
sives (independents would be a bet
ter characterization) of sufficient nu
merical strength to exercise the bal
ance of power. Regular Republi
cans and Democrats were so nearly
equal in numbers that neither party
could prevail on issues of organiza
tion without aid from these inde
pendents.
The House has 435 members. Two
hundred and twenty-five were elect
ed as Republicans, 205 are Demo
crats, with one classified as Inde
pendent (Kvale of Minnesota), one
as Farmer-Labor (Wefald of Minne
sota), and one Socialist (Berger of
Wisconsin). There are two vacan
cies, making the present membership
433.
With all congressmen in attend
ance, therefore, a majority of 217
was necessary to elect the speaker
and adopt rules.
Twenty of the Republicans, with
Kvale and Wefald, made up the in
dependent group that opposed the
Old Guard program as to House rules
and officials.
The test came on the choice of
speaker. That office had to be filled
before any other question of organ
ization could be decided.
Frederick H. Gillett of Massachu
setts was the caucus candidate of
the regular Republicans. The first
ballot gave him 198 votes, with 195
for Finis J. Garrett, the Democratic
caucus nominee, he having the sup
port of all the Democrats present.
Twenty-two protesting members di
vided their votes between Henry Al
len Cooper of Wisconsin and Martin
B. Madden of Illinois, with Cooper
having 17 and Madden 5. Through
six ballots on opening day and the
