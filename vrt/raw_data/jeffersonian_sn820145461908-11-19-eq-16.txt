Uncle Alexander's Vie Ips
Our hired man came in with a
choice little bit of gossip, and my Un
cle Alexander and Aunt Hetty lis
tened with interest. ’
“He came a flyin’ out o’ the house
with his suspenders streakin’ out be
hind him, an’ a pot lid come after
an’ hit one o’ them fancy cochins of
hers an’ laid it out stiff,” chuckled
our hired man.
“It’s an ill wind that don’t blow
no one no good,” commented my Un
cle Alexander. “That ought to mean
a chicken dinner.”
“Then she stood in the doorway
an’ gave him the wust tongue lash
in’ that you ever heard tell of,” said
our hired man. “If there was any
tin’ ornery that she didn’t call hiin
my inem’ry ain’t what it uster be.”
My Aunt Hetty made a deprecatory
noise with her tongue and teeth.
“Sech doin’s!” she exclaimed.
* ‘ Oh, I dunno! ’ ’ said my Uncle Al
exander.
“How’d you like me to throw pot
lids at you?” asked my Aunt Hetty,
“I s’pose you’d like that.”
“We certainly ain’t had chicken
for quite a spell,” said my Uncle Al
exander. “Not since Brother Piper
was here. She didn’t hit him with
anythin’, did she, Preston?”
“I don’t cal’late she did,” replied
our hired man. “Not with anythin’
that she threw at him ”
11 1 don’t see nothin ’to grin ab >ut, ’ ’
said ray Aunt Hetty, severely “I
think she ought to be ashamed of
herself. I don’t hold with sech carry
in’s cn. Standin’ an’ hollerin’ at
him so’s folks could hear her!”
“You could have heard he; a
mile,” said our hired man.
“All I can say is I wonder at
her,” said my Aunt Hetty. “She’s
a real smart woman, an’ turriblc neat
in her housekeepin’, but that don’t
excuse her actin’ that wav.”
“I guess Eben didn’t get no more
than what was nessry,” said my Un
cle Alexander. “I don’t know as I
blame her, myself. She’s got to do
somethin’ with him, an’ all she’s g >L
to do it with is her two hands an’
her tongue. Eb’s too plague-taked
mean an’ shif’less for any use.”
“There’s other ways,” said my
Aunt Hetty.
“There’s one other way,” correct
ed my Uncle Alexander. “You take
a woman like her, though, ar’ she
ain’t got but the one. When a wom
an is cross-eyed an’ yaller, an slab
sided, an’ bony, she’s got to do the
best she can.
“I’ve took a heap o’ notice of fe
males that’s got the name of bein’
limber-tongued an’ free with the
broom handle, an’ there ain’t nary
one that I can call to mind that would
take fust prize at a beauty show.
They’re mostly homelier than sin in
a sermon.
“The human man is so constitoot
ed that he has got to be driven or
coaxed, one o’ the two. The human
woman is so constitooted that she’s
got to coax or drive, one o’ the two.
That bein’ the case, if she can’t
coax, by reason of havin’ a face fit
ten to stop a clock an’ a figger to
match, she’s got to get a flow of lan
guage. ’ ’
“I don’t see why she can’t talk de-
cent, even if she ain’t no beauty,”
said Aunt Hetty.
“The trouble is that she can’t set
on her husband’s knee and pull his
whiskers,” said my Uncle Alexander.
“She can’t coozle. If a woman’s
plump and has got rosy cheeks an’
bright eyes, she can get anything she
wants by jest coozlin’ up to him an’
talkin’ baby talk.”
“I’d like to know how you found
that out,” said my Aunt Hetty, tart
ly. “I should think you’d be
ashamed to talk that way before a
young boy.”
“I ain’t never ashamed to tell the
truth,” said my Uncle Alexander.
“You never see a good-lookin’ young
woman resortin’ to hardware and
kitchen supplies to carry her point.
She don’t have to. An’ you don’t
never see a lady like-Huldah Reddick
caressin’ her husband’s bald spot an’
cooin ’ to him. If she did he’d have
her put in an insane asylum, an’ she
knows it.
“It’s easier to coax, an’ it’s a
sight pleasanter, but it ain’t every
body that can do it, even if they
wanted to. That’s the reason that I
feel sorry for Eb’s wife an’ make al
lowances for her. That’s the reason
that whenever I hear a right good
lookin’ woman sayin’ that she can’t
understand why anybody should take
a flatiron to her man, or call him out
of his proper name at the top of her
voice, I feel as if she needed en
lightenin ’.
“It’s easy for folks to set back
an ’ find fault with their neighbors,
but if you wasn’t the good-lookin
woman that you are, Het, an’ you
had a triflin’, no-account, mean cuss
like Eben Reddick for a husband,
’stid of a sober, stiddy, sweet-temper
ed, lib’ral, hard-workin’, uncomplain
in,’ sensible man like me, there’s no
fellin’ but what you’d let loose some
time an’ give him a taste o’ the
rough side o’ your tongue. Mebbe
you’d throw pot lids, but anyway
you’d say things that wasn’t compli
ment ’ry. ”
“You’d be s’prised out o’ your life
if I did, wouldn’t you?” said my
Aunt Hetty, sarcastically.
“I’d never get over it,” said my
Uncle Alexander.
“Then you’d better put that fence
around my flowers that you’ve been
agoin’ to for the last three weeks,”
said my Aunt Hetty, grimly. “I’ve
waited jest about as long as I in
tend to.” —Opelika Morning Post.
SONG.
When I am dead, my dearest,
Sing no sad songs for me;
Plant thou no roses at my head,
Nor shady cypress tree;
Be the green grass above me
With showers and dewdrops wet;
And if thou wilt, remember,
And if thou wilt, forget.
I shall not see the .shadows,
I shall not feel the rain;
I shall not hear the nightingale
Sing on, as if in pain;
And dreaming through the twilight
That doth not rise or set,
Haply I may remember,
And haply may forget.
—Christina Rossetti.
