"SOLD, BY THUNDER!"
One night, recently, a Wliitehaîl
gentleman was on the Troy train
returning home. At Saratogo it
gentleman from Rutland took a
seat behind the Wli il dialler. Jn a
lew minutes a conversation was
opened between the two Ascer
taining that our friend was from
Whitehall, the. Rutland gentleman
asked him if ho knew Wilkins, the
editor of tho Times.
"Know him ! I ought to know
him, for he is very intimate with
my wife."
"You don't say?"replied the Rut
land man, in astonishment.
"Yes sir. 1 don't want it repeat
ed, but I have good evidence that
he has been on terms of the closest
intimacy with her."
"But, my friend, you don't live
with the woman."
Yes .sir ; strange as it may
seem, I do. O sir, you little know
what a man will put np with from
the woman he loves. This intima
cy has been carried on for years
right under my very nose, and yet
by the love 1 bear the woman I
have never yet broken with my
wite."
'But you cannotjiossibly put up
with such conduct on the part of
your wife ? It she is intimate with
Wi'-kins, I should think you would
brand tho vidian before the world.
I would not submit. No sir! J
would not, never !"
Tho Rutland man had worked
himself up to a pitch of excitement,
when the train stopped at White
hall.
"Good night, sir !" said t h e
Whitehall gentleman. "J hope we
will meet again. I thank you for
the interest you have taken in in y
affairs j" and the two gentlemen
shook hands and parted.
Just then the conductor entered
the car, and the Rutland man
stepped up and asked him who !he
gentleman was he was just couvers
ing with.
"That man,'' said conductor llol
conib ; "don't you know him ?—
That is Wilkins, editor of the
Whitehall Times."
Sold, by thunder !" said the
Rutland man putting his fingers in
Iiis pocket and taking out some
thing. "Mr. Conductor, will you
please give him this card and ac
companying $0, and tell him to
ml me his paper so long as the
money lasts ?"

John Robinson made New Years

he called them liars and sue!:.

There's wailing in every household,
John Robinson—there's grief in
every heart. And yet you claim
that you were only havi:i'-* a little

"That's all, your Honor ; it was
