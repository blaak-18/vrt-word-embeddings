hag, and goats on the shrubbery and
gardens in said district amount to more
in damages than the value of the stock
allowed to roam at large. Besides,
vicious animals make it dangerous for
ladies and children to walk the streets
at any time.
Several of the best schools and
school buildings are located here, be
sides several churches. Numerous at
tacks have been recently made by some
of these animals on pedestrians who
have had narrow escapes from great
harm. The animals above referred to
are the property of very few persons,
perhaps less than half a dozen.
tVe submit that it is unjust that the
many should be subjected to so great
inconvenience, danger and damag:, for
the benefit of the few.
Trusting that your sense of justice
will grant this relief prayed for, this
petition is respectfully submitted.
