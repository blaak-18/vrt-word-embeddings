the murder of lle Adat Washington tI
on the 14th inst., on the farm of

The weapon with which the victim aI
met his fate Is a most earloostl con
Itrueted ridle. The barrel is '2 in
ches, long. At the bult is a piece of
steel working in a groove or rather
set at right angles to the perpendicu
las cuf the barrel. 'l'lhisi qneer piece
of steel is four and a lIlf inches long, M
one and a half inches wide, three ,,
quarters of an inch thick and contains "
Ave chlambers, with a tuble on thie nn- re
nnderneath to each chamber, This r
i. held in its plalce lby means of a
spring witlh two small pins fitting in i
holes on the toll, alid is piuslhed by
halnd, after depressing the lower end
of the spring, thusn releasing it from
its place. The trigger is like tile or- an
dlinary Ihair trigger only hung solid on r
ita point. 'i'lis queer itide bears the eb
