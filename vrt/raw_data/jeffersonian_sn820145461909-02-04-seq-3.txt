Any one at all acquainted with
Mose Spencer would have known, by
merely glancing at him, as he walked
along the road one morning, that he
was exceedingly angry; and one who
prides himself upon being a shrewd
prier into an individual’s mind, tak
ing up each thread of motive and trac
ing it to the end, would have declared
that Mose was beset by that con
suming and hopeless anger which finds
no relief in prospective revenge. I
am not inclined to think that Mose
was directly descended from the poet
whose “Faerie Queene” Hume de
clares is never read except by people
who look upon such a performance
as a duty, for there was not about
Mose even the most remote suggestion
of that refinement which contemplates
poetry. In appearance he was a typi
cal backwoodsman, but his extreme
harshness of face could not rest upon
this fact for its origin, for many of
the mildest countenances and faces
of gentlest erpression are found in
places where the pedagogue has made
but few tracks. Nobody liked Mose.
He took such delight in cruelty that
he would climb a fence and go through
a patch of briars to throw a stone at
a harmless dog.
As Mose neared a blacksmith shop,
where several men were lounging, he
hesitated upon beholding certain
“devilish fellows” as if he dreaded
something, but when one of them yell
ed at him, he shrugged his shoulders
and approached them.
“We’ve hearn all about it,” said
Sam Stoveall. “Hearn it this morn--
in ’. ”
“Yes,” Andrew Horn joined in,
“ an ’ we ’re all mighty sorry fur you. ’ ’
“I want you fellers to shet up,”
Mose replied, lifting up the tail of
his long jeans coat and seating him
self on a stump. “The infernal luck
is enough without sieh talk.’
“W’y, what’s the matter, Mose?”
the blacksmith asked. “I ain’t heard
nothin ’. ”
“Gal horned at my house last
night,” Mose answered.
“Wall, now, that ain’t nothin’ to
cripple a man, is it? Thar’s been a
gal borned at my house ever’ year
from about as fur back as I ken rec
olleck, it ’pears to me, an’ I ain’t
seed nobody limpin’ round on that
account.' W’y, confound yore onery
pictur’, man, you oughter be glad that
it is a gal. Boys don’t do nothin’ but
cause trouble, nohow.”
“That’s all right,” Mose rejoin
ed, “but I wanted a boy, an’ this gal
business makes me as mad as a hor
net. I had jest sot my heart on a boy
—had prayed for one, an’ dreamed
that it would be a boy, an’ now, con
found it, a miserable little ole gal—a
common ever’day gal comes to take
his place. Fellers, it makes me mad,
thar ain’t no gettin’ round that
sack. It makes me so mad
that I have dun tuck a oath that
I’ll never have nothin’ to do with
the young one. I wouldn’t kere es
she’d die befo’ I git home.”
“Mose, fur the Lawd’s §ake, don’t
talk thater way,” said the blacksmith.
“It’s a sin an’ a shame fur a man
to ’spress hisse’f thater way agin his
own flesh an ’blood.”
“I’ve dun said it an’ I’ll stick to
it,” Mose replied. “I b’lieve that
LITTLIL ‘DISTL'R: ®y °^ ie ead
the Lawd sent that gal jest because
He’s got a spite agin me.”
“I’ve got a little gal at my house,
an’ I wouldn’t take a heap o’ no
man’s money fur her,” Sam Stoveall
remarked. “She’s jest nachully the
puttiest thing I ever seed, an’ I’ll be
dinged if I’d give her for ever’ boy
on the place.”
“you fellers might talk thiser way
till —till whut’s his name blows his
trumpet, an’ it wouldn’t change my
mind none,” Mose replied. “An’
es she lives I’m goin’ to show her that
she found her way inter the wrong
house. ’ ’
“A man that’ll talk thater way is
a blamed fool!” exclaimed Andrew
Horn.
“Be finder keerful, Andy,” Mose
replied. “Ricolleck that I ain’t took
no oath to put up with ever’thing that
a feller is a mind to say to me.”
“I don’t kere whut you’ve done nor
whut you hain’t done, Mose Spencer,
but I’ll just I’arn you you kain’t talk
thater way whar I am without findin ’
out whut I think of you.”
“It ain’t none o’ yore bus’ness
whut I say about my own affairs.”
“It mout not be in the sight o’ the
law,” Horn rejoined, “but it is in
the sight o’ the Lawd, an’ as I rid a
circuit two seasons, you must know
that I’ve got more respeck fur the
Lawd than I have fur any law our
legislature ken make.”
“It don’t make no difference if you
have rid a dozen circuits, you ain’t
got no right to meddle with me.”
“Don’t git ashy, boys; don’t git
ashy,” said the blacksmith.
“ Wall, let him tend to his own bus
iness,” rejoined Mose. “He’s got
no right to come around givin’ me
p’inters, even if he did ride a circuit.
I could a rid a circuit, too, es I’d a
wanted to.”
“It’s a mighty fine circuit you
could ride,” rejoined Horn. “W’y,
you mout try for ten years to get
religion, an’ even then the fust thing
you’d know old Satan would nab you
jest the same as if you hadn’t prayed
a pra’r.”
“I don’t ’low no man to talk to
me that way,” exclaimed Mose,
springing to his feet. “I’ve got
enough trouble an’ disapp’intment on
my mind without being insulted.”
“Ketch you jest the same as if
you hadn’t prayed a single pra’r,”
Horn repeated.
Mose sprang forward, but the pow
erful blacksmith seized him and shov
ed him back. “Don’t let us have
no skylarkin’, Mose,” said he. “Some
fellers got to skylarkin’ in this neigh
borhood onct, an’ one o’ ’em trod on
a cob, fell an’ hurt hisse’f, an’ ever
sence then I have thought it was dan
ger’s fur fellers to skylark. Andy,”
addressing Horne, “yore horse is dun
shod, an’ I reckon you mout as well
go on home.”
Andy grinned, and, whistling a
camp-meeting tune, mounted his horse
and rode away; and Mose, remain
ing but a few minutes longer, sullen
ly strode toward home. When he
reached that place—a desolate log
cabin with two tumble-down rooms
—he opened the door with a violent
shove, and passed into the room which
he used as a sort of cobbler-shop.
He sat down on a bench, took up an
old boot, and had begun to examine
©be Teffersonlan
it, when an old woman entered.
“Mr. Spencer, don’t you want to
see the baby?” she asked.
“Get outen here.”
“Miz Spencer ’lowed that you”—
“Get outen here, I tell you.”
“My conscience alive, man, won’t
you let a person talk? I want you to
understand that you air orderin’ yore
betters around when you order me.
Es you wuz a little blacker than you
air, w’y, I’ve seed the time I could
buy an’ sell you three times in a day.
You ought to be ashamed o’ yourself,
you great big, lubberly, good-fur-nuth
in’ thing, to get mad at that po’ little
baby, jest like she could he’p bein’ a
girl; an’ es I wuz in yore place I’d
be afeard the Lord would strike me
down, an’ it wouldn’t be no mo’ than
right, nuther. Yore wife wants to see
you a minit.”
“I don’t want to see her, nur you
nuther. Git out. ’ ’
“Now, Mr. Spencer, if you will be
a fool, let me advise you not to be sich
a hard-headed one. Go on in thar a
minnit, please. Es you don’t, I’ll
vow an’ deelar’ that I’ll trudge right
off home an’ let you get somebody
else to stay here. ’ ’
“Wall, then,” exclaimed Spencer,
throwing the boot aside and getting
up, “es nothin’ else will do I will go
in, but I want it understood right now
that I won’t have nothin’ to do with
that diserp’intin’ critter.”
When he entered the room he found
his wife weeping bitterly.
“Mose,” she said, “fur the Lawd’s
sake don’t stay mad this ’ere way.
I know you wanted a boy, but it
couldn’t be he’ped. Look at the po’
little”—
He turned away, and slammed the
door as he went out.
H.
v With stubborn cruelty Mose had in
sisted upon naming the child “Diser
p’intment,” which was in time short
ened to Diser. She was a remarkably
beautiful child, with long yellow hair
and with eyes which looked up with
charming inquisitiveness. Until she
was two years of age her father took
not the slightest notice of her; and
once, when he had frowningly turned
away from her outstretched arms,
Mrs. Spencer said:
“Mose, how ken you do that?”
“Don’t talk to me thater way, Sue.
You know well enough tthat I don’t
want nothin’ to do with her.”
Diser grew more beautiful as th£
years came. One day, when the child
was about four years old, Mrs. Spen
cer, upon returning home from a visit
to a neighbor, saw her husband, with
Diser on his back, trotting around the
house.
“What on earth has happened?”
the delighted woman exclaimed.
Mose, easing the child to the
ground, and then taking her into his
arms, replied:
“I hil out like a fool, Sue, but I
jest nachully had to come to taw.
She’s the sweetest human I ever
seed.”
“An’ I ain’t afeard o’ him, mam
ma,” the little girl cried. “See,”
putting her arms around his neck.
“He ain’t mad at me any more, air
you, papa?”
“Mad at you! W’y, es a man wuz
