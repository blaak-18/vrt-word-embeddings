would suggest that some other of
our local organizations help out
this laudable undertaking.

The people in these parts are
cheered np over thegood rains with
which we have been blessed. With
a continuance of propitious weather
there will be a very fine cotton crop.
Corn does not show up well. In
some localities rice is growing satis
factorily. Judging from appear
ances it is safe to predict that pota
toes will be plentiful. We may not
make much money, but with hog,
hominy and potatoes we'll surely
not starve. No money in the coun
try. Dollars as scarce as peanuts
in a grave-yard, or, as lawyers in
Heaven.
Our neighborhood is greatly stirred
up over some arrests which have
been recently made. The people
here sincerely sympathize with the
parents of the young men who have
been raised amongst us and we hope
that our able and generous officers
will be as lenient as possible toward
them, this being their first offense.
Our temperance society meets
every Saturday. We have about
seventy members enrolled, and the
membership is increasing gradually.
Come on boys. There is room for
the whole world. Join and help us
make a bold fight against whisky.

this parish, a .place selected by his
grand parents as their abode, when
they came to this country as exiles,
determined to serve their God, and
their adopted country, without hin
drance and free- from oppression.
At z7 years of age he withdrew from
St. Charles College at Grand Coteau,
and volunteered his services to the
Confederacy, and joining Sims Bat
tery, fought in all the battles in

mercantile business, in Carencro.
He served as postmaster during the
Hayes administration. He held the
position as town marshal for the
last three years. He was a con
scientious and thorough democrat,a
true patriot, a kind husband and
devoted father. Mr. Bernard leaves
a widow, eight children, a large
number of relatives, and a host of
friends to mourn his loss. The Ga

AT ROYVILLE.
*Happiaginjg in the Busy and
Thrifty Town-Reported
for the Columns of The
Gazette.
-With the exception of a few
days of very hot weather, the past
few weeks have been pleasant and
cool. Crops, in general, are in ex
cellent condition and cotton espe
cially could not be better; corn is
much better than at first expected.
Patatoes and vegetables are fair,
-It is indeed discouraging to
know that cotton, our main product,
must again be sacrificed this fall.
Surely, after the '94 crop will be
given (not sold) sway, our farmers
should then be convinced, that
nothing but starvation faces them,
should they continue to raise that
tallen staple. Why not resort to
truck farming? Corn, potatoes,
rice, hay, pumpkins, vegetables,
in fact, any and every other pro
duct but cotton. Try truck farming,
and you will see, that more money
and less labor will be the result.

feel proud in saying that our little
inland village has earned somewhat
