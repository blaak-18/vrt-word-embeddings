THT STO'R'f OT THT SWITCH
Sy Alex, K. Schmidt
I—. J.—J
TYPICAL day of the
warm southern sun was
inviting the indolent in
habitants of the suburbs
of Memphis, Tenn., to
siesta. The hroad, white
boulevards, bordered by
irregular rows of houses
and limited by an even line of trees,
were deserted except for a few ne
groes and a few belated carriages. A
quiet, a full peace, a warm atmos
phere of indolence, lay over the re
gion, and human activity was at rest.
Upon one of the wide, green lawns
sloping before an ample mansion, sat,
in a deliciously cool summer house,
hidden and embowered by fragrant
honeysuckle and roses, a young lady
and a young gentleman. They were
engaged in lively conversation. The
young man, clothed comfortably in
white pique, sat twirling his Panama
hat in his fingers, the while looking
away from the laughing eyes of his
dainty vis-a-vis. His was a hand
some, manly face of the brunette
type, cleanly, clearly drawn, pierced
by large, hazel eyes which looked hon
estly at any object that fell under
then* gaze. Just now they were avoid
ing the direct, merry glance of the
beautiful Miss Yerby, who, dressed
in a rich mulle, which alk ved her
dimpled arms to show, and for com
fort, not effect, was cut low at the
neck, had evidently besced him in
some argument. Like the kindest of
womankind she was taking advantage
of her victory, and poor, young
Breckenridge in his clean, young
heart, was ill at ease. For the space
of ten seconds the color mounted to
the olive cheeks, and then the domi
nant dark eyes rose slowly and stead
ily looked at the soft little tormentor.
She stopped laughing and spoke.
“I beg your pardon, Allen, but
really I couldn’t help it, you know.
I just had to laugh.” She spoke with
the musical modulation of the south.
“That’s very good, Marion. I’m
only too glad to see you happy. You
must know that. The dream of my
life is to make you happy. Oh, Mar
ion, let me, let me—” Yearning and
passion came into his voice as he
pleaded. He rose respectfully in his
instinct of innate breeding and with
sad eyes and twitching lips waited for
her words.
A. sigh came from her lips, a young
girl’s sigh, a bird’s awakening to
sorrow. She rose, also.
“Allen, I like you very much. But
I have told you before that —and then
—the —switch, you know.” Her voice
trailed away into a whisper and she
stood clasping and unclasping her
hands in her nervousness.
In spite of the weight of embarrass
ment produced by the circumstances,
the young people laughed. But it was
no laughing matter to them. It was
merely that the tension had to be re
lieved in some way. Besides, Miss
Yerby’s timid reference to that deli
cate article of woman’s headgear—a
switch —bore upon an interesting top
ic in the history of their young lives.
At best the attempt at merriment was
a poor one.
Young Breckenridge smiled sadly
while trying to his words. Very
often he had explained the matter of
false hair, but it was usually to deaf
ears. Positive little Miss Yerby had
her own views upon the subject.
What could a young man do in the
dimpled face of such stubborn oppo
sition? It was a very foolish matter
without any of the ridiculous append
ages of temper.
“Marion, I’ve told you the truth
about this four times at least. You
won’t see it. If you only knew how
sorry I am. Is there no way in
which I may prove the truth of what
I say?” Wretchedly he looked at
her as he put his question: he loved
her very much,
“That lies with you, Allen. I
would be glad to believe you,” Marion
said softly. There was a tender look
in her eyes as she gave him her hand
in parting.
“Mamma will wonder at what has
become of me. I hope that you can
prove the truth of what you say, Al
len. I hope it, I hope it.”
If she had not hurried away at the
psychological moment it may be taken
for granted that she would have sur
rendered in spite of her bold front,
and that would have spoiled every
thing. Breckenridge did not attempt
to call her back but started homeward,
sad and mildly angry. That he loved
to dance upon the many whims of
mood, his sweetheart knew well, but
when she was entirely and wholly un
reasonable, as tonight for instance,
in spite of his breeding and natural
chivalry he let his temper dictate to
him for a time. All on account of
that switch of hair. Os course, he had
taken Laura Willard, of Willard Place,
driving. It was evening when they
"started—-to Allen the hours of the af
ternoon were evening—and it was very
late or just a wee bit early when they
returned. But it was not his fault
in any way; Marion should have for
bearance enough not to upbraid him
for anything for which he was not
to blame. But, like all dainty, charm
ing, unreasoning little angels she
would listen to no explanations. He
was to produce documentary proof.
Poof!
That Miss Willard should have lost
the little ornament for her head,
commonly called a switch, was unfor
tunate. Young Breckenridge had had
no hand in the accident. The first
he knew of it, and he was holding the
reins with both hands at- the time,
was when Miss Willard gave a
startled exclamation, and clapped her
hand to her head. Then she told
Allen of her loss. He had known
Laura from childhood and discussed
things with her as with a sister. He
jrapidly stopped the rockaway and
turned for an explanation. What was
she saying? Why, the switch was
all right. With some care and a lit
tle confusion, Miss Laura explained.
What was to be done? They had
gone over six miles and more of road,
and Laura would not go home without
her hair. The search which followed,
Glje Jeffersonian
lighted by the feeble flame of a bor
rowed lantern, was a long one, and on
several occasions Breckenridge had
much ado to keep his temper. Once
he knocked at the farm house door of
a poor white man; this man was one
of the few poor whites living in this
section of the South. Allen came to
ask for a match, and found two men
sitting up with a corpse* He did not
stop for the matches. But finally he
was rewarded for his trouble, and af
ter hours of tramping over the dusty
road, he picked the long black curl out
of a wheel-rut. He gave it to Miss
Willard and then, with the greatest
speed, drove home.
In some way, a very natural one,
no doubt, this adventure came to the
intelligence of Miss Yerby, and imme
diately there was trouble. It was
fierce war at first but time had mel
lowed the young lady’s anger until
it had degenerated into occasional pe
riods of pouts and simulated indiffer
ence. But the breach was very real
to the young man. Things had come
to the pass where he must do some
thing to close this breach. He was
a desperate lover and his brain
evolved many wild plans.
An obvious solution finally came
to him and he made a call upon Miss
Willard. But when he looked into
the eyes of this determined young
lady, he faltered. He could not say
what he had, come to say. He feared
the outbreak which he felt was sure
to come from the lips of the young
lady if he spoke. He had come to
do no more and no less than to ask
her to explain to Miss Yerby the true
status of the false hair. Could he
ask it? Only when his stay had
rubbed painfully into the last mo
ments did he say:
“Laura, I want you to do a great
favor for me. Do not ask what it is
but promise.”
“Oh, I can’t do that, Allen, you
know! ”
“Well, I feel you’ll not grant it to
me if I enlighten you, but I hope from
my heart you will. You see, Marion,
Marion Yerby, and I were as good
as engaged before we took that drive
together. I don’t think of this drive
in my prayers, Laura. Well, somehow
or other, she has heard about the ac
cident and, of course, she wants an
explanation. I have told her the truth
but she’ll not believe me. Don’t you
see? She knows the truth anyway
and so I beg—oh, you will, won’t
you ?”
Throughout this stuttering, halting
petition, Miss Willard’s face was be
coming redder and redder and her
eyes brighter and brighter. When
Breckenridge had finished his speech
and raised his eyes from the carpet,
he felt that the young lady had grown
in stature. She was imposing in her
anger and he stepped back from the
stern look in her face.
“Mr. Breckenridge! Mr. Brecken
ridge! You have insulted me, and
you’re a Southern gentleman.” She
spoke in low, vibrating tones and nev
er once relaxed the tense lines of her
face.
