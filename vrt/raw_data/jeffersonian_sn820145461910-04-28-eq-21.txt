SOME FORAGE PLANTS OF VALUE
By Martin V. Calvin.
There is a wealth of forage plants
in this country. Among them, there
are none that are superior, or in
many essential respects, equal to the
varieties of sorghum which have
been tested and which have proved
their value. In point of fact, it is a
misnomer to call either Link’s Hy
brid, Amber, Orange, or any of the
saccharine producing canes, sorghum.
They are as far removed and as sep
arate from sorghum, known South
during the Civil War, as it is possi
ble to imagine.
The Government (particularly while
Mr. LeDuc was Commissioner of Ag
riculture) and the experiment sta
tions, directed effort for several
years to making sugar from the va
rieties of cane mentioned. The efforts
put forth were fairly successful.
Had the Government addressed itself
to the manufacture of high-grade
syrup from the cane, results highly
beneficial to the people would have
been developed. It is a fact, that
from either of the canes mentioned,
especially Link’s Hybrid, 200 to 400
gallons of the very best syrup can be
made per acre.
There is an additional fact, name
ly, that at least 30 bushels of seed
per acre can be harvested from the
cane just at the time it is richest in
the syrup-yielding juices. The seed
are next to wheat in nutritious value.
Another fact: It is not necessary
to strip the cane in order to prepare
it for the mill. The leaves will not
discolor the juice. The waste cane,
called bagasse, retains 90 per cent, of
starch. Properly cured, it is equal
to the very best cured corn-fodder.
In 1879, Alexander H. Stephens—
observe that no title is necessary to
locate that most distinguished Geor
gian, an intellectual giant in the days
of giants—sent me from Washington
a package of Amber cane seed. I ex
perimented with the seed, and be
came greatly interested in the sub
ject. From time to time, I tested by
crops the several varieties at that pe
riod most at the front. I studied
and experimented with the canes with
a view to the production of forage.
In every instance, the results won
were more than satisfactory as to the
quantity of fodder and of seed ob
tained per acre. The former was nev
er less than 5,000 pounds of cured
forage or the latter less than 30
pounds of prime seed per acre.
After careful tests, I accepted
Link’s Hybrid as the best of the sev
eral popular varieties.
In 1907, at the Georgia Experi
ment Station Link’s Hybrid, Amber,
Orange and Kennedy’s Improved Am
ber were compared. The yield in
green food per acre was as follows:

The cane was cut at the time the
seed tufts were about to appear. Had
the cane been permitted to develop
and ripen seed, the quantity by
weight would have been increased 25
to 33 per cent.
A word as to seed selection and
studying growing crops as well: It
will interest your readers to know
just how Mr. Ephriam Link, of
Greenville, Tenn., discovered the cane
• which the national Department of
Agriculture named for him.
Mr. Link begun with Honduras,
which he purchased in Mississippi.
He was so pleased with that variety,
he discarded all others. It remained
seemingly pure for several years. In
1879, he noticed in his crop a good
many heads which indicated a mix
ture. He at once sent to Texas for
a renewal of seed. The new seed
gave a pure crop, ripening two to
three weeks earlier than the Hondu-
A Department of Interest to Farmers
ras he had cast aside. The new seed
proved true till the fourth year, when
a sprout was discovered in the grow
ing Honduras entirely different from
it. This Mr. Link propagated. He
found its yield and richness in juice
second to no other, and its syrup
freer from the twang in flavor, some
times present, than any he had ever
made. Thereafter, he made a spe
cialty of the hybrid. Mr. Link passed
into the beyond a number of years
ago, but his son, Mr. Robert Link,
continues to grow his father’s favor
ite cane near Greenville, Tenn.
Regardless of the seed-bearing va
riety, it should be planted, for the
best results, in rows four and one
half feet apart, checked two and one
half feet. Approximately, a fertil
izer that will analyze 10-2-8, will
supply the requisite plant food. Use
300 to 400 pounds per acre in drill.
Muriate of potash preferable. Hav
ing distributed the fertilizer, throw
two furrows and knock off with a
board. At each check, with eye of
hoe or heel of shoe, make an inden
tation about three inches deep, drop
into the same as many seed as can be
taken up with thumb and second fin
ger, cover and press with foot. That
is a very troublesome procedure,
some will say. There is no such
thing as “troublesome” in making
thorough preparation for any crop.
It is painstaking that will guaran
tee a perfect stand, the seed being all
right.
When the plants make their ap
pearance, they resemble crab grass
and make slow progress because
“rooting” is under way. That mis
sion accomplished, the plants will
grow a-shouting. Cultivate as corn,
rapidly, lightly, level. Four pounds
of seed will plant an acre as indi
cated. Ninety days from the day the
seed is dropped into the earth the
seed-tufts will be perfect and the seed
in the dough state, ready to be har
vested.
Where the cane is grown with a
view to syrup, do not use any stable
manure. When the latter is used
under a crop for forage, apply per
acre in the furrows two to four tons.
At each check, drop a single handful
of muriate of potash. Throw two
furrows, knock off with a board.
Plaht seed as suggested in the fore
going. Do not cut for any purpose
until the vegetable wax—a sugary
substance—appears on the stalks, and
the seed-tufts are about to appear.
Up to the time when the vegetable
wax shows itself, the plants are ab
solutely green, not any more suitable
for food for cattle than green peaches
for man.
Cut at the time stated, the cane
can be as easily and as quickly cured
as any other forage plant. It may
be stored in barn loose; better still,
baled and stored or sold. True econ
omy suggests the baling of all forage
crops.
This is a year in which an extra
large acreage should be seeded to
some one or more of the varieties of
saccharine canes I have mentioned.

GARDENING NOTES.
Take up all rubbish and burn it
before drawing on the manure. Plan
the garden with long rows so it can
be cultivated with a horse. It is not
necessary that one vegetable shall oc
cupy a whole row.
Build a hot-bed or cold frame and
start early vegetables—tomatoes,
cabbage, lettuce. Radishes can be
grown for early use in cold frames
with little labor.
Give the garden a dressing of well
rotted stable manure. Additional ma
nure or fertilizer can be added as
needed when planting.
Does the garden contain a straw
berry bed, and are there a few rows
of black-cap and red raspberries,
blackberries and currants along one
side? If so, the old wood should be
taken out and the laterals trimmed.

Cut them well back so there will be
a large number of new fruit laterals
formed. If the garden does not have
these* luxuries, make arrangements
to set some this spring.—Chicago

A WORD FROM A CROPPER.
Dear Sir: —Being a reader of youi*
two Jeffersonians, I have read with
interest the piece on the “Half Crop
per.” The renter does not get credit
for all he does; there are some trif
ling renters, but not all. I appeal to
the land-owner to help the renter.
The owner of land does not put con
fidence in the renter; he will sell him
rations at extortionate prices, or go
to the merchant and make arrange
ments with him to furnish him with
rations at what he claims cash prices,
and then charge him ten per cent, in
terest. If the land owner would loan
him the money he could buy provis
ions for a lot less. This lack of con
fidence has kept many a man poor.
Brother renter, I call on you to help
keep up the farm; you are afraid to
tack on a board, for fear you won’t
stay but one year; you won’t put out
fruit trees; you say, “I don’t know
whether I will stay but one year.” If
all would fix up where you live, when
you moved you would lose nothing.
I’ve made it a rule to build up in
place of tearing down; I would rather
leave a place improved by me. I have
built houses; I get the use of them
while I stay. I’ve known renters
who would not cover a well shelter,
and would rather buy a rope every
year, because the owner would not
pay them. Respectfully,
Statham, Ga. J. A. WALL.
THE SMALLER FARM.
How to make the farm more pro
ductive, the farmer richer and the
cost of living to city people less than
it is, is pretty well solved by a Kan
san, according to the Kansas City
Star, which says:
George Logan farms fifteen acres
near Crane. He farms it so well that
last year he received $5,4 00 for his
vegetables and fruit. These fifteen
acres are part of the 640 acres his
father tried to farm with the aid of a
family of boys, and the 64 0 acres
never produced as much in one year
under the old methods as the fifteen
acres yield under the new.
Never has there been such impetus
given to agricultural education as in
the last few years. Many new schools
have taken the subject up, farmers’
institutes are preaching the doctrine
of more scientific farming and great
er yields, and the newspapers and
magazines are making it clear to
every one who can read display head
ings that the farm’s the place from
which success beckons to every young

MUCKRAKERS.
The Muckraker does the most dis
agreeable although beneficial and
necessary work for the preservation
of all that is best in society. He
“muckrakes” without pay; he per
forms this disagreeable work from a
sense of duty. He receives the con
stant abuse of degenerates for his
worthy labors, and the class of socie
ty, the best that is left to us, do not
sustain him.
Jesus Christ was the greatest
muckraker in His day. Did He not
“kick the money changers out of the
Temple, and roasted the hypocrites
and Pharisees?” This is muckrak
ing.
Theodore Roosevelt and Tom Wat
son are the two greatest “muckrak
ers” in America today.
