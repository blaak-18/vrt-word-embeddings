Shall we Move.
The decision of the Supreme Conrt
onftirming the Constitutionality of the
bond act insures the early completion
of the New Orleans Pacific Railroad.
While this enterprise is of vast impor
tance to our State, and the benelfits to
accrue therefrom are immeasurable to
the people and property generally,
our city should at once carefully study
her individual interest in the matter.
The VINDICATOR has been a cham
pion of this road from its earliest con
ception, and we are gratified to know
that all obstacles have been overcome
by its management. Pluck and ener
gy has told, and now our town'is call
aed opon, to save itself; to practice a
modiacum of those especially American
virtues.
The road will pass within 8} miles
Soath and 14 miles West of us, tap
plag, from the latter source, a large
local trade. We can see but one rem
edy to repair such a disaster: that is
so reach for trade in other directions.
We are naturally situated so as to be
in a commanding centre of a large
local trade, but we fear our people re
ly entirely too much on their natural
advantages. In order to hasten our
prosperity it becomes as to exert all
our abilities, to expend all our means,
and now that this railroad is so near
us, and yet so far in a business or
rather a trade point of view, we most
work at once.
With a tap road running over this
81 miles distance we will gain, by
throwing our'elves upon railroad
termini, and upon the line of railroad
connection, all that section East and
North of us, embracing a larger scope
of territory, more populatioD and more
valuable lands than our Western trade
now covers.
We learn that the Railroad Compa
ay will co-operate with as in this en
terprise; that they will aid ou mate
rially to accomplish it. All that we
are required to do is to construct the
grading and cross tie the road, the
Company will put on the iron and
rolling stock. We entreat our citi
seas to take hold of this matter and
push it to success.
The Morehouse Clarion, if we un
derstand it correetly, willcease advo
eating a Constitutional Convention
"at this time" because it fears that the
party would split on such an issue.
The Clarion has hitherto been'sa strong
worker in the cause of honest princi
pie and we are very much pained to
see its defection. If the end of dem
ocracey in this State is to fill offices
with a certain class of oes who call
themselves democrats, we might agree
with our meek contemporary, but we
insist that the democratic party has a
higher mission than this. Our party
has pledged an honest government to
the people and that can never be had
except by and through an honest con
stitution* If to assert vigoronsly
honest principles is dangerous to de
mocratic party unity, then the party
is an uniication of corruption and
cowardice, and deserves not only dis
ruption, bat, everlasting Infamy. If
we might be.so bold we beg the Cla
riots to give as an outline of the prio
eiples upon which we are to appeal to
the people for support this fall. The
thin dodge of "defeating the enemy"
won't do; for the reason that "the
enemy" is rather a vague and unmean
lag shibboleth. It is something in
the orderof the "reform and retrench
meot' cry in 1878, which ended- -well
we all know where. We insist there
ear be no "policy canvasson this year,
males. it ia desired to return an As
seably of stnpi4 stumaps. The cry of
the people for a specife and aggress
ive canvas has gone forth, and we
hope the Clarion will yet remain in
the ranks where it has done such yeo
man service.

The meeting of this body on May

done, satishctory. It wasjodged, and
very properly, that, owiog to the
present condition of the party, so

The Committee was largely attend
ed, and it was the unanimous that a
bold aggressive canvass should be in
augurated, while Indeed nearly all the
members were outspoken for a Con.

Special Correspondent of the Cincinnati
Gazette.
"GREEN CASTLE PLANTATION,"
NATCllTO('ES, LA., March, 1 878.
A new light has lately been let into
this remote and isolated region. This
old Red River country-so rich in re
sources, but much of it so inaccessi
ble and elow- is now brightened ,by
a new hope, and an assured confi
ence in the near future. It is at
last to be lifted out of the woods and
wilderness, and to be brought into
blose contact with the busy world.
When calling recently on Governor
Nicholls, in New Orleans, he had
just signed the New Orleans Pacific
Railroad bill, and I can here appre
ciate the earnest expression he then
gave of his estimate of its vast im
portance to this section, as well as to
the entie State. So highly fa
vored as this Red River region is in
climate, soil, etc., it would be hard
to overestimate the benefits to he
brought by this railroad enterprise,
at last to be seenred after so many
years lost from the general march of
progress. Probably no part of the
country has suffered so severely from
lack of an ontlet, or been so retarded
in development for want of inter
course with the outside world as this.
Certainly none possessing such capa
hilities has continued so long-much
of it still in its primitive condition
dragging through the severe disad
vantages and drawbacks of frontier
life. With the causes that have
kept it so, the obstacles which have
prevented progress, I am not fully
familiar. But to an outsider it is
marvelous that this people, in one of
the oldest and finest States in the
Union, should, through several gene
rations, have continued to haul their
cotton and other products with long
ox and male tenniams, winding their te
dious way as best they could through
vast forests and over almost impassa
ble roads distances of fifty to 100
miles, making ten to twenty miles a
day, camping at night along the way,
to Red River, where they could find a
market and from which they might
obtain supplies. To a Northerner,
living among railroads running in
every direction, through mountains
and across great chasms, stopping at
no cost, as in the case of "the Cincin
nati Southern," it is hard to imnagiine
what hinderances could be possible
here where railroads can be built at
$10,000 to $15,000 a mtoile. But these
people are about to abandon their
pioneer practices. After a hundred
years or so of this experiments, they
have decided to try a change, and no
doubt they will be pleasedl with it.
Nature has done her share in provi
ding Bed River. It is a good stream,
of incalculable value to Northwestern
Louisiana, Terxas, etc., and from its
wonderful winding and turning seems
to be doing its best to accommodate
the entire trade of this conntiy; but
at last it is found that there is room
here, far a railroad. By the bill late
ly passed, the Legislatore of Louisi
ana lends *2,000,000 in bonds in aid
of the New Orleans Pacific, in ex
char ge for *2,500,000 of the bonds of
the company, which guarantees the
completion of the road within a year
or fifteen months to Shreveport,
where it strikes the Texas Pacific.
Running through the heart of this
extensive and fertile region, lying
between the Mississippi, the Red
River and Texas line, it will open to
innmigration some of the moit invi
ting conotry on the contiment; offer
ing to settlers valuable lands at mere
nominal cost, giving them a market
almost at their plantations, and bring
ing them within a few hours, instead
of several days, of New Orleans, and
within quick reach of the Northern
cities. From this point to New Or
leans, instead of 500 miles by river,
taking three or four days, it will be
about 200 miles, taking eight hours.
From New Orleans to Shreveport, in
stead ot 700 miles by river, and four
to five days, it will be about 275
miles, or eleven hours. To New Or
leans, also, this road is indispensable
for the recovery of the enormous trade
taken from her since the completion
of the road from St. Louis, tapping
Texas, Northern Louisiana, etc., as
well as for the development of this
vast scope of country tributary to
her, and for the settlement and culti
vation of this better portion of the
State, much of which still lies unoc
eopied and idle. With the comple
tion of this road sad the opening of
this region to imnuigration, there will,
no doubt, be a speedy flow of new
life and enterprise into this whole
country. Although there is some ap
prehension that a question may arise
as to the constitutionality of the
State's issuing these botnds, yet, since
the people have become aroused as
to the necessity of the road and to a
determiniation to build it, considera
ble work having already been done,
its early completion seems assured in
any event.
Time climate here, as I have expe
rienced it, is genial and delightful, and
doubtless through this portion of the
State is generally heal thy. Duting
the winter the thermometer ranges
asually In the ffties. Now, in March,
it is sixty to seventy, about such
temperature as that of our June in
Ohio, with a slight haziness similar to
our "Indian summer," with scarcely
any change for a month or so past.
While the summers are long and
warm, there are no "spells" of in
tense heat, such as we frequently suf
fer in the North-is generally quite
comfortable in the shade, with the
nights pleasantly cool. The impres
sion in the North that there Is more
or less yellow fever here every year
is a mistake. As I am told, there
bas Dot been a case in this vicinity
for twenty-ive years-since 1853.
As to the lay of the land and quali
ty of the soil, I kiotw of no foer
plantation than many of thuse along
Cane and Red rivers. This rich al
'luvial land, high and out of the reach
of overflow, is justly famous for its
fertility and beauty. The yield of
these plantations, under good eultiva
tion and with a fhir season, is about
a bale of cotton of 500 'lbs, to the
kate, *Mcha at aeversge 6f 100. per
Ib~~th sha heandsomaeshotvlun th4 r
which, it is expected, will proIt'va
I,9N)I) miles of cottln thi.- 1 ='. t.
coIrn, 25 t, 50 bushels to 1v vie,
selling oni t to plantations at 50 in T3c.
per -h ILl Under the present un
Ipr'ec'dwtdtnI low price of cotton,
plantiing, as at the North just now, is
not maki'ig a very satisfactory re
turn. Mich of this season's plantilng
is alreadyl dione. Potatoes, planted
in Jianuar'y, and now in blossom, are
very prlodnetiie, yielding hundreds of
bushels to the acre. Sweet potatoes
particularly tine. Corn all planted.
SMuch of it is quite high and being
worked. Cotton planting is busily
progressing, and with a very favora
tIle season, will soon be finished.
Other crops can be successfully cilti
vated here-oats, rye, etc. Gardens
are well advanced, there being two
gardening seasons-spring gardens
and fall gardens.
Fruit prospects good; peaches now
so largo as to be (,lut of reach of frost
-should there be any-which is not
apprehended. But varied nnd abund
ant as the products of this soil might
he, it is hard to divert attention
from the one great industry. "Cot
ton is King," and will likely continue
control as in most cases the more
profitable labor. The plantation ne
gr)o's normal condition here is plant
ing and picking cotton, and taken
from this, except for the cultivation
of a little corn, his genius and occu
pation are gone. The labor question,
until lately so vexatiods and thieat
ening, is greatly ilmproved within the
last dear or two. With the riddance
of this region from political adven
turers, andi with less politics to fer
ment the predjudices and passions
of the colored people, they have
come to realize their dependence and
interest with their white empiloyers,
and have settled down contentedly
and calmly to their nccupatious. The
more worthless, roving, mischiefmak
ing darhies having mostly left, the
industrious and peacefully disposed
have quietly turned again to making
a living by labor, and working, as
they generally are, for a share, the
planters can now have some comfort
in calculating upon raising a crop.
Since the incoming of the present
parish and State governments-the
government of the intelligent, tax
paying element-there is certainly a
vast improvement on the condition
of things as we saw it five years ago,
in the observance of law and order,
and in the better security of proper
ty and life. Juries can now be found
to convict criminals, and Judges to
punish them, so that lawlessness has
largely been suppressed, law reinstat
ed, and outrages and crimes, which a
few years since were so frequent, are
now almost as rare here as in the ru
ral regions of the North. This iun
proved condition of things is also
largely due, it is said, to the late de
crease of intemperance. No doubt
the case. But, from my observation
since coming into the State, and from
the fact that Louisiana invested $45,
000,000 during the last year in wines
and liquors, a stranger might be led
to suppose that there is still some
room for improvement here in this
particular. Strong drink is still the
dreadful slavery of this people, both
white and black. Freedomu thus far
has made but little change here in
the condition of mutual dependence
between the races. The whites must
still have the labor of the blacks, and
the blacks must still have the direct
ing care and providetit oversight of
the whites. The only way to work
any improvement in this condition of
things, and in the life and outcome of
this country, will be by a plentiful
infusion here of the live Yankee ele
ment, with its energy, enterprise, and
thrift. This the completion of the
railroad will doubtless soon accom
plish, and will, we trust, before long
more than restore the ante-bellum
glory as it is described to have reign
ed on many of these wealthy planta
tions of the olden time. It is said
there is great mortality here among
the blacks. This is not surprising to
one seeing their improvident, thought
less, and in most cases wretched way
of living. They certainly "take no
thought for the morrow." This, ad
ded to their ignorance, and their ab
surd superstition, renders them ready
victims of disease and deatlh. Many
of them when taken sick---especially
those who may lately have "got re
ligion"-believing that "their time
has come," bucked by their friends,
persistently resist all means offered
for their recovery. But from the
swarms of colored people crowding
to the river as our boat stopped at the
plantation landings-little ones by
the hundred seeming to pop out of
the ground in groups-there appears
to be no danger of their soon becom
ing extinct. While in tihe main they
are kindly cared for by their em
ployee, their condition of ignoranice
and superatition is generally deplora
ble and both for their moral and
physical welfare, as well as for the
interest of thie whites, their better
enlightenment is urgently demanded.
During a horseback ride of 130
miles into the interior through the
parishes of Natchitoches, DeSotti, and
Sabine, toward the Texas line, I have
just enjoyed what was a great novelty
to a "Buckeye"-miles on miles of
vast majestic primeval forest; riding
from fifteen to twenty miles at a
stretch through their unbroken, silent
depths, with scarcely the sight of a
living creature, man or beast, hbt on,
with nothing within view but the
grand towering trees, many of them
80 to 100 feet to the branches, and
three or four feet through, covered
with dense foliage, festooned with the
long, hanging gray moss, so beautiful
by contrast with the green; the un
dergrowth bright with the blooming
dogwood and hawthorn, the many
colored buds and flowers, and fall of
fragrance from the blossoming of the
sweet wild plum and magnolia-all so
wild and luxuriant that one could al
most imagine himself in the midst of
a tropical forest. In the vast cypress
and pine woods of this region there is
great wealth awaiting an outlet by the
completion of the N. O. P. Railroad,
throngh the heart of which it is to run.
For this lamber a ready market will
be found close at hand in the prairies
and timberless country of Texas,
where pine fencing now sells for $40
to *60 per 1,000. When passing
through this conotry I rode over the
Banks and Smith battlefield, between
Pleasaat Hill and Mansield, and saw
the unwelcome reminders of those
disastrous days. An old gentleman
in the neighborhood, describing tW me
the rush of the demoralised, panic
stricken troops after the battle, both
sides supposing themselves badly
beaten; bow 3, 00 half femashed sok

I thought it wTeld hiot'. a intliency to
confuse the oldest man. A striking
i'h'.racteristic of this Ieotpjnlt' ij their

ner. Not of the gentleman only, in
his plantationu mansion, but frequently
the poor man,. in Ihis "piney woods"
cabin, where Iheo dispenses his "con

Ihospitality and a collnrteols air that

cials these people ale recovering from
the severe tra oppression which nwa

years ago, tlhen anionnting in mll any
cases to actIual confiscation of their
property. From 8c. then, the rate has
been reduced to about 2j, with prom
ise of further reduction. So much for
the rule of intelligence and character.
Politically, this country is at last on
joying a calln. The "Roturning
Board" muddle having been peace
fully disposed of, the only dangerous
bone of contention has, for the pres
ent, at least, been removed, and we
earnestly trust that a gracious relief
from political agitation is at last to be
vouclhsafed to this long distracted
State. J. R. P.
WHO DID IT?
The other day Senator George made
a speech and proved that lie "didn't
do it," and on Monday Senator Sandi
ford will prose the same thing as re
gards himself. We see in this an or
ganized movement to repodiate the
late General Assemnbly by thie very
members thereof.' We are well aware
that a large number of the members of
that much abused body are known to
be perfectly innocent, because they
didn't know any better, but we beg
the really suspected to come forward
and explain. They should do this
at once because the last man will
catch h-alifax. He will stand alone
on the burning deck, while in the
meantime thie thing is did, and we
have no doubt, from present indica
tions, that it will be proven that the
"thing done itself."
The N. 0. Pacific Railroad.
The Supreme Court has unanimous
ly decided thie Constitutionality of the
New Orleans Pacific Railroad act, and
the early conmpletion of this popular
enterprise now becomes a fixed fact.
The rejoicing of thie people of this
section over the decision was univer
sal, and we now look forwarfd to the
permanent solution of our difficulties
-our country will be developed, our
resources augmented, our lands valu
ed and immigrants will poor in upon
us.
Our city is left 81 miles from this
great line, and every eflort should be
made to connect us therewith at once
We can build the grading and cross
tie a tap at very little cost, and the
company will willingly supply the
iron and rolling stock. Will our peo
pie act ?

Is it not clearly the JreaT of every

Is it not the DUrry of Congress, as the

Is it not criminal for Congress to stifle
and suppress the truth in ro grave a

Is it not absurd to assume that the
question of settling the facts is identical
with the turning out of Hayes ?
Is it lint wise policy to keep these two
questions totally ditierent and apart?
Is it not best to have it distinctly un
derstood that the demand for an investi
gation is by no means identical with a
demand for the installation of Mr. Tilden ?
Is it not entirely possible that even if
it should be absolutely proven that Mr.
Hayes was not elected, the law and pub

Would it not be putting the Demo

Would it not seriously shake the popu

Would such refusal to investigate and
