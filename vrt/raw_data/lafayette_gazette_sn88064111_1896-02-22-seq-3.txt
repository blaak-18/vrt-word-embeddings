Necrological.
Mr. Samuel F. Simpson died at
his home in this town Tuesday
morning. Mr. Simpson's death
came suddenly, as only an hour be
fore tae fatal moment he was seen
upon the streets of our town. His
death was a surprise to his friends
and acquaintances, as no one thought
that his end was so near. He,
alone, seemed to know that his
earthly existence was soon to be
brought to a close, as not long ago
he said to an intimate friend that he
felt he would "soon pass over the
river to rest in the shade of the
trees." Not that his health was bad,
but he had lived the allotted span
of three :cotes and teti.
Mr. Simpson was born in Darke
county, Ohio, on the 26th of De
cember, 1825. At an early age his
family moved to Mishawaka, Ind.,
where he spent his boyhood days.
t the age of x8 he moved to Louis
ville, Ky., where he remained sev
eral years. On Feb. so, z850, he
married Miss Mary Esther Beers at
New Albany, Ind. His marriage
was blessed by several children,
four of whom are living: Dr. A. . H
Simnpson of Arnaudville, Mrs. Pierre
Olivier of Lake Charles, Mrs. Thos.
S. Singleton of this parish a. d Mr.
O. H. Simpson of New Orleans. A
short time after his marriage Mr.
Simpson settled in Louisiana, and
be it said to his credit that he
proved himself in every way a
worthy citizen of his adopted State.
When the war broke out he enlisted
in the Confederate army and served
the cause of the South with un
swerving fidelity until the end of the
conflict.
During a number of years Mr.
Simpson wa, a prominent citizen of
Arnaudvill-, St. landry parish,
where he owned and managed the
Oak Shade plantation and where he
was engaged in mercantile pursuits.
Seventeen years ago he came to this
town and up to the time of his
death he was one of its most valua
ble and respected citizens. Being a
man of remarkably quiet lisposi
tion, it was when he was appointed
postmaster the public became ac
quainted with the many good quali
ties whic:. won for him the esteem
and respect of all who came in con
tact with him while in the discharge
of official duties, which he always
performed to the satisfaction of both
the government and the people. He
was conservative in his temper, and
though tolerant of the political and
religious views of others he was firm
in his own opinions. As a friend
he was true, as a man honest, as a
husband and father devoted and
kind. By his death, it may well be
said, a good Christian has gone to
his rest.
The services over his remains were
held at the Methodist Episcopal
church by the Rev. Mr. Reams, and
the burial took place in the Pro
testant cemetery.
Mardi Gras.
Mardi Gras was celebrated in La
fayette with usual splendor. There
was no parade and no king, but the
maskers decked in all the hues of the
rainbow rode and marched through
the streets in what Col. Dudley
would call "blocks of five." Many
of our people went to New Iberia
and St. t artinville and some to
New Orleans to participate in the
festivities.

Swords Has a Cinch.
Things are getting quite funny in
St. Landry. At the instance of the
Thompson faction, it is said, Regis
trar Swords and a number of other
good citizens were indicted by the
Grand Jury for having failed to ex
tend the proper courtesies to negro
voters who wanted to register.
The indicted parties, excepting 1
Registrar Swords applied for bail
and were released. Swords refused I
to apply for bail and said he would
remain in jail. It's here where the
hitco came. The registration office
was advertised to be opened at I
Opelousas and Belleview two of the
strongest negro polls in the parish
and the Thompson people are very I
much interested in having the ne
groes to register. As nearly all the
white people had registered Swords r
thought by remaining in jail he
would shut out the coons. It then
dawned upon the Thompson people
that they would have to get Swords
out of jail. They offered to furnish I
the necessary bail, but the registrar
insisted upon remaining a prisoner. I
An order was issued b) Judge Per
rault to Sheriff Fontenot to release
the prisoner at once, but that also
failed to bring about the desired re
sults and Swords is still master of
the situation. Judge Perrault has
wired to Gov. Foster about the mat- 1
ter, but the governor tas very prop- l
erly refused to act in the absence of
the facts of this very strange case.
The friends of Swords are doing
their best to keep him in jail, and
his enemies are kicking like steers
because they can't get him out. All
this trouble in our neighboring parish
would have been avoided if the
Thompson faction had submitted to
white primaries.
Swords had better apply for a
patent on this new scheme to sup
press the negro vote. It certainly
has the merit of originality and we
hope it will prove effectual. We
dlare say that St. Landry is the only
place on earth that can produce a
registrar who would have been
equal to this emergency, but great
is St. Landry ! Greater is Marion

Electric Bitters.
Electric Bitters is a medicine suited for
any season, but perhaps more generally
needed in the Spring, when the languid ex
hausted feeling prevails, when the liver is
torpid and sluggish and the need of a tonic
andt alterative is felt. A prompt use of this
m,:dicine has often averted long and perhaps
fatal billious fevers. No medicine will act
more surely in counteracting and freeing the
syst -m from the malarial poison. Headache,
Ilndigestion, Constipation, l)izztness, yield

The exposure to all sorts and
conditions of weatner that a lumber
man is called upon to endure in the
camps often produces severe colds
which, if not promptly checked, re
sult in congestion or pneumonia.

of the Fort Bragg Redwood Co., an

Cal., says they sell large quantities
of Cijatnberlain's Cough Remedy at

relief. This medicine prevents any

Another Refinery.
The people of Lafayette should
try to get another refinery. Last
year, through the efforts of that in
defatigable gentleman, Col. Gus.
Breaux, aided by the B. Mi. A., the
necessary capital was secured and a
refinery was built within a short
distance of this town. Despite
the fact that the plant was complet
ed late in the season this town and
vicinity have been greatly benefited
by it. Enough cane is produced
around Lafayette to feed at least
two more refineries and we believe
that this fact can be established
to the sattsfaction of investors.
We understand that the people of
I.afayette have their hands full with
water works and electric light and it
might not be wise for them to un
dertake to do too many things at
one time, but we think that as soon
as practicable they should take
steps toyard the erection of another
refinery here.
In a recent editorial the Salem,
Oregon, Independent says: "Time
and again have we seen Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy tried and nev
er wvithout the most satisfactory re
sults. WVhenever we see a person
afflicted with hoarseness, with a
cotgh or cold, we invariably advise
them to get Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy; and when they do, they
never regret it. It always does the
work, and does it well.i' For sale

Cheapness doesn't mean merely
little money-it means value for

cheapness because that doesn't ex-i
press the facts about the BIUCKSKIN i
13BKERECt.S. W'e tell you that they
are better in every way than the so-i
calledc cheap goods--then we say
they don't cost any more. If com

good pants at the same price?
