"A GREAT REMEDY.
T.e £eu.6s.m eG. Free A..redsI .
For come weeks past the Chimeia
has beeu ruaning An advertisement of
the SwaIp A ngel Company. We had
nvt given it very much attention, and
while we had eati.fied ourselves that it
was a good medicine, we had no true
ilea of its rel ivalne. From direct
.videare we can affirm to any one in
terested that this medicine is possibly
what has lon-g been looked for. We
s.louild be Plow to make this assertion
butJor the fact that some strong teeti
mouials have come under our notiee,
Naei we here preaent them. The orig.
inal letters are now in the possession
of the mucasian.

Fallir.g Prices.
Our :agrieultural priduets have
been declining in price for a num
ber of years, and there must be
some cause other than that thread
bear over pro(luction theory.
We received leSs per pound for
a seven million crop of cotton than
we did for a six and a-half mullion.
That knocks out your little over
production argument.
Your next cry may be supply
and demand.
Millions of eople have little or
no cotton clothes, at least not half
as much as they could use. hyv,
if each family had as much cloth
as they needed, we could use up a
years crop in less than a month.
The supply could not equal the de
mand. It is plain that we must
rake up another reason.
Is the rental value of land res
ponsible f We pay less rent now
because rental values have declin
ed as well as prices.
What's the cause of all this
shrinking in values and fall in
prices f
The contraction of the currency,
did you say I
Now you have struck it. As an
illustration : contract the currency
just one-half, destroy every other
dollar, and the money left will pur
chasr. what all of it (lid. The con
traction of the currency is the ba
sis of low prices, and both old par
ties have been following along that
line.
Remember that just as much as
the circulating medium is contract
ed, just so much shall the values
of arsicles be lowered. The whole
matter is this, the scarcer money
gets, the more products it takes to
get it.
The Virginia Sun has the follow
ing to say about Mr. B. W. Balley
and his paper, the Banner of Lib.
erty :
Mr. B. W. Bailey, the able edi
tor of the Banner of Liberty,
Minden, La., has severed his con
nection with this publication and
goes to Alexandria, La., to take
charge of the "Age of Reason,"
a Populist paper that will be issued
there at an early date. Dr. T. J.
Taybor will from this time forward
conduct the editorial management
of the Banner, which we consider
one of the best Populist papers
published in the Pelican State.
Nothing could be unfairer, more
inequitable, than a money fine for
any crime, It is putting up jus
tice for sale. Suppose two men,
convicted of the same misdemanor,
are each fined $10. At first thought
you will say that is just. But sup
pose one man works for $1 a day
that means ton days of his life.
The other man has an income of
$100 a day-that means one hour
$f his life. The first man not
having $10 goes to jail, while the
mnext buys his freedom-pays the
oleiers $1O-for they get the mon
ey. If the men have done some
thaing deserving punishment, put
them both in prison for ten days.
That will be just. But there us
still another side. The poor man
may have some excuse-has not
had the proper training and envi
ronments. But the rich can not
make this claim-be has had the
means of good breeding-his crime
is the greatest.-Appeal to Reason.
We have received sample copies
of "The Condition of the Ameri
can Farmer" by H. E. Taubeneck.
Every farmer should read this
work, as it contains many truths
hacked up with statistical tables,
and shows the causes which led to
the present conditions.
How long would the merchant
stay in business if he received loses
for his goods than they cost him,
and how long can the agricultural
cless continue to raise their pro
ducts and receive less for them
than it costs to produce them 1
Whben the income is less than
the outgo what can you expect ?
The Lord commanded you to
earn you bread by the sweatof
your brow and not of your neigh
bors. Yet some people are earn
ing a living by the sweat of their
brows and at the same time earn
ing enough to enable some usure
to live a life of luxury and eas.
