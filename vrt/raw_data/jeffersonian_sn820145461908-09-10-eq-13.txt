WHY DOES MRS. SMITH GET ON
MY NERVES?
(Continued from Page Five.)
willing to have them different? Is
there any reason for it except the
very empty one that we consciously
and unconsciously want every one
else to be just like us, or to believe
just as we do, or to behave just as
we do? And what sense in there in
that ?
“I cannot stand Mrs. iSo-and
so; she gets into a rocking-chair and
rocks and rocks until I feel as if I
should go crazy!” some one says.
But why not let Mrs. So-and-so rock?
It is her chair while she is in it, and
her rocking. Why need it touch us
at all?
“But, ” I hear a hundred women
say, “it gets on our nerves; how can
we help its getting on our nerves?”
The answer to that is: “Drop it off
you nerves. ’ ’ I know women who
have tried it and who have succeeded,
and who are now profiting by the
relief. Sometimes the process to such
freedom is a long one; sometimes it
is a, short one; but, either way, the
very effort toward it brings nervous
strength, ias well as strength of
character.
Take the woman who rocks. Practi
cally every time she rocks you should
relax, actually and consciously relax
your muscles and your nerves. The
woman who rocks need not know you
are relaxing; it all can be done from
inside. Watch and you will find your
muscles strained and tense with
resistance to the rocking. Go to work
practically to drop every bit of strain
that you observe. As you drop the
grossest strain it will make you more
sensitive to the finer strain and you
can drop that —and it is even possible
that you may seek the woman who
rocks, in order to practice on her and
g’et free from the habit of resisting
more quickly.
This seems comical—Almost Ridi
culous — to think of seeking an annoy
ance in order to get rid of it; but,
after laughing at it first, look at the
idea seriously, and you will see it is
common-sense. When you have
learned to relax to the woman who
rocks you have learned to relax to
other similar annoyances. You have
been working on a principle that
applies generally. Y r ou have acquired
a. good habit which can never really
fail you.
If my friend had invited Mrs.
Smith to supper and served baked
beans for the sake of relaxing out of
the tension of her resistance to the
sugar, then she could have conquered
that resistance. But to try to
conquer an annoyance like that
without knowing how to yield in
some way would be, so far as
I know, an impossibility. Os
course, we would prefer that our
friends should not have any dis
agreeable, ill-bred, personal ways, but
we can go through the world without
resisting them, and there is no chance
of helping any one out of them
through our own resistances.
On the other hand away may open
by which the woman’s attention is
called to the very unhealthy habit of
rocking—or eating sugar on beans —if
3effersonian
we are ready, without resistance, to
point it out to her. And if no way
opens we have at least put ourselves
out of bondage to her.
The second way in which other peo
ple get on our nerves is more serious
and more difficult. Mrs. So-and
so may be doing very wrong
—really very wrong; or some
one who is nearly related to
us may be doing very wrong —and it
may be our most earnest and sincere
desire to set him right. In such cases
the strain is more intense because we
really have right on our side, in our
opinion, if not in our attitude toward
the other person. Then, to recognize
that if some one else chooses to do
wrong it is none of our business is
one of the most difficult things to
do—for a woman, especially.
More than that it is difficult to
recognize practically that, in so far
as it may be our business, we can best
put ourselves in a position to enable
the other person to see his own mis
take by dropping all personal resist
ance to it and all personal strain
about it. Even a mother with her
son can help him to be a man much
more truly if she stops worrying
about and resisting his unmanliness.
“But,” I hear some one say, “that
all seems like such cold indifference.”
Not at all —not at all. Such freedom
from strain can be found only through
a more actively-affectionate interest
in others. The more we truly love
another, the more throughly we
respect that other’s individuality.
The other so-called love is only love
of possession and love of having our
own way. It is not really love at all;
it is sugar-coated tyranny. And when
one sugar-coated tyrant antagonizes
herself against another sugar-coated
tyrant the strain is severe indeed, and
nothing good is ever accomplished.
A small head of lettuce spread
apart without separating the leaves
from the stem end, sprinkled with
Spanish red peppers —.the kind that
come in cans —and dressed with
mayonnaise, made an attractive salad
at a recent supper. The lettuce head
stood on a broad lettuce lead. Chop
ped nuts, chopped olives or any other
’ salad mixture might be used in the
same w T ay over the lettuce, or a
French dreessing mixed with grated
cheese or powdered hard-boiled egg
yolk might take their place. Some
times the open head is filled with a
chicken or Waldorf salad mixture.
Not many women die old maids.
Though there seems to be a great
many old maids in a town, most of
them marry some time, if their chance
is a little late in coming. More men
die old bachelors. After a man
reaches 50 he becomes very proud of
the fact that he is unmarried, and
regards it as a piece of cunning on
his part to have escaped with so many
women after him. —Atchison Globe.
Mr. “Fingers” Conners may not
exactly measure up to the Jeffersonian
standard, but that doesn’t worry Mr.
C., who has no time to waste on a
“dead one,” under which heading
T. J. is catalogued in Mr. C.’s mind.
