Hie American Federation of Labor
has come out in support of the John
son immigration measure, now pend

best measure that has been present

Hugh Frayne, general organizer for
the American Federation of Labor.
Japanese Menace
California has had its day on the
immigration question before the sen

ator Phelan, one of the Sacramento
editors, and the district attorney at
San Francisco all told the senate
committee that California is against
the Japanese immigration to its
shores; all of them declared it a men

grown in the last few years.

try who want to keep America for
Americans.
Representative John L. Cable, of
Ohio, is a strong member of the
house immigration committee who
advocates “keeping America Ameri
can." In a speech in the house of
representatives recently he said:
“I want to call further attention
to the influence that is being brought
to bear on this immigration ques
tion. Take the city of New York, for
example. The foreign stock consti
tute 80 per cent of the population.
Only 20 per cent of the people of the
city of New York are native born of
native-born parentage. What hap
pens in the city of New York? I read
from the New York American of Feb
ruary 20, 1924, the following:
“‘The board of aldermen yesterday
unanimously adopted a resolution
petitioning congress to defeat the
Johnson immigration bill.’
“That shows the effect of the fore

laws should be passed and what
should be defeated.”
KLAN MAY SUE PAPER
FOR LIBELOUS STORY
The Pittsburgh (Pa.) Post False
ly Blames Klan for West
Virginia Flogging
CLARKSBURG. W. VA., March 17.
—The Ku Klux Klan is planning to
institute a damage suit against The
Pittsburgh Post, according to an
nouncement made by the chief of the
department of extention here to
day. The suit x is the result of a
headline carried in the Pittsburgh pa
per.
In the issue of March 5, The Post
carried a story of an alleged beating
at Buckhannon. It was stated that
the victim, Guy Burnside, had receiv
ed threats signed K. K. K. prior to
the beating. The headline writer on
The Post captioned the story: “Klans
men Beat Man, Officers Investigate."
Here is The Post’s story:
BUCKHANNON, W. VA., March
4.—“Upshur county authorities
are conducting a probe into the
beating and wounding of Guy
Burnside, 39 years old, in his
lodgings at midnight by a band
of men. Burnside declared the
men who mistreated him wore
robes and Indian headgear, while
their faces were painted like In
dians. Several nights ago he
said he received a note warning
him to leave his lodging within
24 hours. It was signed “K. K.
K.” Sheriff Zickafoose found an
other note in Burnside’s room
wrapped around a razor, stating
that expect to use this at
once.’ This note was unsigned.”
An investigation made by a repre
sentative of-the Klan disclosed that
Burnside had not been beaten at all
and every indication points to the
fact that he was not even molested.
It is believed that Burnside told the
story with the anticipation of suing
the city of Buckhannon for damages
or that he told it for the purpose of
discrediting the Klan. Dexter Lan
ham, who was beaten by a band of
men last summer, recently sued the
city for damages and it is the opin
ion of some that Burnside might have
derived an inspiration from the
Lanham case.

diately following devotional services
in the local Protestant church a re
cent evening, and while the church
choir was singing “America,” approx
imately 100 members of the Ku Klux
Klan, attired in full regalia of the
order, marched down the aisle of the
crowded edifice, and presented the
pastor, the Rev. Mr. Skaggs, with a
cash gift. Following a few remarks
relative to the great American or
ganization, the minister thanked the
robed men for their kindness.

Dictating to Congress
Klan Is Power Behind Broom That
Is Sweeping the Nation of Rottenness
Just recently Bushnell, the nationally-knovvn cartoonist, whose
pictures are syndicated through many newspapers in the country,
illustrated a broom, sweeping out the hyena of vice and all its at
tendant evils. However, he failed to show who had hold of the
broom handle and was the driving force behind the clean-up. The
above cartoon, the idea of which is taken from Bushnell’s illustra
tion, shows just who is behind the clean-up drive that is spreading
over the country. lowa is in the line of the on-coming broom. It
will not be long before bootleggers, vice denizens and crooked poli
ticians feel the full force of the Klan broom. The Klan has cleaned
up in Indiana, in Ohio, and it is going to do the same thing in lowa.
The Klan is liked for the enemies it makes, and one of the most
bitter of these is the crooked politician, with his criminal satellites.
Wig Wags from Washington
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 10.—
The soldiers’ bonus bill that is under
consideration for this session of con
gress is now in the hands of the sub
committee of the house ways and
means committee for the finishing
touches. It is believed that it will
be ready to report to the house in a
few days, and when it is reported,
Chairman Green says he will seek a
special rule making the bill immedi
ately in order for consideration by
the house.
The form of the paid-up insurance
policy provision, the basis of the new
measure, has been taken up by the
subcommittee. Several proposals for
such a provision have been present
ed, including that of a member from
New Jersey, for 30-year endowment
policies payable at the age of 62, but
the method of figuring the values of
the policies has not yet been deter
mined.
It is now believed that the bonus
question will come up in the house
immediately after the Muscle Shoals
project is finished. If this proves
correct it will have been shoved in
ahead of the immigration measure,
which has been on the house calendar
for some time awaiting its chance to
get up for consideration on the floor
of the house.

Not Politically Inclined
Walter Bossert, well known to ev
ery Klansman in Indiana, and like
wise to many members of the organi
zation in other states, doesn’t seem
to be paying much attention to that
political bee that has been buzzing
around him recently. According to
Indianapolis newspapers, Bossert is
being fought by Senator Watson and
his crowd to keep Bossert from go
ing to the Republican national con
vention.
Mr. Bossert was in Washington over
Sunday and his Hoosier friends down
here were kidding him about the
Watson opposition, but Bossert just
smiled and denied the whole thing.
He says it is amusing to him the
way others are trying to draw him
out when he has no political ambi
tions and is seeking no political hon
ors. When Mr. Bossert’s attention
was called to the statements of the
Indianapolis papers, he issued the
following statement:
“I am not a candidate for any fed
eral, state or county political office.
Neither am I a candidate as a dele
gate to any national or state con
vention. I am only interested in my
own private business affairs and 1
have my hands full.”
Mr. Bossert did, however, digress
just far enough to admit that he
was interested in the success of the
candidacy of Hon. -Ed Jackson for
governor of Indiana, and that he in
tended to do everything in his iiuw
er to help nominate and elect nim.
"That’s as far as my political ambi
tion goes right now,” said Bossert.

Opposition for I'lidernood
Much of the opposition to Senator
Underwood in the south in his race
for the Democratic presidential nom
ination comes from his unreserved
denunciation of the Ku Klux Klan.
Senator Underwood in nearly all his
references to the Klan has dealt
THE FIERY CROSS
wholly on the undesirable features of
it, and he has made no concession to
the existence of anti-immigration
sentiment and other local causes
which have led so many persons in
the south to join the Klan organiza
tion.
Organized labor is also unfriend
ly to Underwood in his own state,
where he is best known. His strong
opposition to woman suffrage and al
so to prohibition are against his
chances now. It is said that Under
wood leaders fear the Klan more than
any other element.

Speaking to Former Immigrants
The Louisville Courier-Journal said
recently: “Politicians already are
playing politics with the Johnson im
migration bill now before congress.
A typical example of this was the
utterance of Representative La Guar
dia in Brooklyn the other day when
he said, This measure is not based
on reason or economics, but on nar
row-minded prejudice, and we will
have to fight it.’
“The demagogy of the statement is
plain when it is noted that La Guar
dia was speaking to former immi
grants.”
* * *
Made a Clean Sweep
The Ku Klux Klan proved its po
litical strength, if you want to put
it that way, up in Maine when candi
dates of three cities, bearing the en
dorsement of the Invisible Empire,
were swept to victory. It was a
clean sweep in Saco and Rockland,
and in one instance put into office a
party that had previously suffered
successive defeats.
• • •
Opposition Expected
Opposition of the La Guardia type
to immigration was expected and
ought to be expected. And it may
be looked for in the future when you
consider that La Guardia has a large
foreign-born element among his con
stituents.
Klansman, do not advertise
your religion on your stationery,
but mix it with your every-day
business so that the whole world
will see that you didn’t learn
your honesty in six weeks at a
business college.

Dr. G. Ck Minor Addresses Audi

Osceola
OSCEOLA. I A., March 17.—Dr. G.
C. Minor, of the national lecture
Elatform of the Knights of the Ku
lux Klan, who is touring lowa mak
ing public addresses in the interest
of the organization, talked to an au
dience of selected men at this place
recently.
The Tribune here has up to date
been one of the very few newspapers
in the state to publish an account of
Dr. Minor's address. It was entire
ly fair in jts account, part of which
is as follows:
“The general tenor of the speech
was said to have been along patrio
tic lines. There was no racial, reli
gious or other propaganda indulged
in. The speaker made an appeal for
higher ideals in government, a more
zealous Americanism and declared
against vice and corruption that ap
pears to exist in high places. He also
discussed in a general way the his
tory and growth of the Ku Klux
movement endeavored to show that
the organization was purely a patri
otic and American' one at heart op
posed to all narrow partisanship and
racial and religious prejudices,
claiming that the true mission of the
Klan was to foster safeguard and
perpetuate the true American prin
ciples outlined by the fathers. The
mildness and counciliatory policy of
the speaker was a surprise to many,
who appear to have expected some
thing more radical.
“The audience of the speaker was
composed, it is stated, of lawyers,
doctors, ministers, business men and
representative citizens of the town.
The speaker said that out of seven
teen secret orders, the Klan was the
only one that had its ritual and creed
on Washington D. C., together with
the complete membership open to
to the inspection of everybody. The
nearest he came to touching upon the
religious phase of his subject is said
to have been when he jocularly re
marked ‘that when A 1 Smith was
elected president, Gov. Parker of
Louisiana vice president, and ex-
Gov. Walton of Oklahoma made se
cretary of state, we would have a
new star in the flag."
CITIZENS GIVE SILVER
SERVICE TO VESSEL
West Virginia Legislature Fails
t© Pass the Necessary
Appropriation
CHARLESTON, W. VA., March 10.
—The West Virginia legislature hav
ing failed to make an appropriation
for a silver service to be presented
to the battleship “West Virginia,”
Uncle Sam’s newest and mightiest
dreadnaught which will be commis
sioned in a few months, citizens of
this state are now preparing to pur
chase a service through subscription.
It is the plans of West Virginians
to purchase one of the best services
money can buy. Funds are being
raised by school children. It is the
plan to have each school student do
nate a dime toward the fund. It is
pointed out that the money can eas
ily be raised in this manner.
It is the custom for each state for
which a dreadnaught is named to
present the ship with a silver ser
vice. The West Virginia legislature,
which is often times referred to as
the “modern feast of Belshazzar,”
failed to make an approporation to
take care of the silver service. Seem
ingly many of the representatives
were too busy to think about an ap
proporation for a service.
It seems as though the eastern
press has taken a fiendish delight in
misrepresenting the inhabitants of
West Virginia. Citizens of this state
are equal to any and superior to
many when it comes to upholding the
honor of a state. With this thought
in mind the loyal mountaineers are
taking private subscriptions that
this state shall not be made look lit
tle. even to presenting a service to
a ship.

Agitator Calls For
Revolution in U. S.
WILLIAM Z. FOSTER
Foster is one of the most notori

States. He was connected with the
steel strike of 1919 and was in the
hands of federal secret service men,
following his activities. He is head
of the so-called Trade Vnion Educa

“education" is soviet doctrine as it
is taught in Russia. That Foster is
agitating for an armed revolution in
the United States was made plain re
cently when he said to a crowd in
Madison Square Garden in New York
City: “Join the party of Lenin and
further the work of revolution in
the United States.”
CROSS BURNS NEAR
POLITICAL CAUCUS
Kasson, Minn., Crowd Gets Real
Thrill When Emblem Is
Ignited
KASSON, MINN., March B.—What
was apparently a well timed climax
for Kasson's municipal election cau
cus held here Friday night, March 7,
appeared in the form of the fiery
cross of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan. The burning emblem sudden
ly appeared in all its glory just
across the street from the place
where the caucus was held just as
the voters began leaving the hall.
Speculation was rife as to whether
the cross was set ablaze by the Klan
itself, local or outside, or whether
some practical joker pulled the
stunt. In either case the spectacle
was just as effective and made the
cold chills run up and down the
spines of some local law breakers,
and some men of doubtful character.
Such remarks as “I wonder if the
Klan has come to Kasson,” and “It
looks as if those dirty robed Kluxers
have landed here,” and others, favor
able and otherwise were overheard.
Nobody saw the cross ignited or
has the slightest idea who is respon
sible, but the general opinion is that
the Klan is spreading throughout
Dodge county and that many a fiery
cross will blaze forth this summer.
The Klan will be welcomed by the
best citizens here.
FAIRMONT, W. VA, March 11.—A
nice new shiny Ford touring car, sans
the proverbial rattle, and with a tank

tion Army. An order was passed by
the local Klan body at its Thursday
night meeting, authorizing the pur
chase of an automobile to be donated
to Captain Alfred Carr, commander
of the local Salvation Army |Kst.
While the machine is being present
ed to Captain Carr, it is, of course,
to be the property of the religious
institution. It is understood that
among the many things the car will
be used for, it will transport unfor
tunate Fairmont kiddies to and from
the country during the coming sum

EVOLUTION SCORED
BY BAPTIST PASTOR
Dr. W. B. Riley Males Address
Before University of Minne
sota Club
ST. PAUL, MINN., March 17.
Carrying on his fight against the
evolution theory to the campus of
the University of Minnesota, Dr. W.
B. Riley, pastor of the First Baptist
church, attacked three text books in
use at the university in an address
before the Liberal Discussion club in
the auditorium of the engineering
building. He described the books as
“atheistic.”
“If these text books remain and
professors in sympathy with them
continue their attacks upon the cita
del of revealed religion, the time
will speedily come when our state
will be no more secure than is the
status of Russia, where this social
gospel already has triumphed against
God and His word,” Dr. Riley said.
“The current notion that man be
gan as a fourlegged creature and de
veloped to the high level of the
modernist professor is pitiably short
of proof,” he said. “That philosophy
would be more readily received had
the nineteenth century produced an
other Moses or the twentieth century
another Solomon or were America
now producing such a generation of
great ones as Greece brought to the
birth and lifted to eternal fame
something more than 2,000 years
ago.”
Mr. Riley declared that the most
alarming feature of the “evil evolu
tion" of the present day is “that it
is a product of the present day teach
ing and its seeds are found not so
much In society as in the school.”
Klan Gives Pastor
Money for Trip
MULVANE. KAN., March 10.—The
attitude of this county toward the
Ku Klux Klan has undergone a decid
ed change since a body of robed and
hooded men appeared at the Bethel
church, near here, last Sunday night
and presented the pastor with a
purse to enable him to go to his
mother’s bedside.
The good deed made such an im
pression upon members of the con
gregation that they passed the hat
among themselves and collected al
most SIOO, which was given to the
pastor. Several men who had previ
ously regarded the Klan in an unfa
vorable light made application for
membership following the Bethel
church incident.
