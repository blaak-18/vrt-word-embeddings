ANOTHER WEAPON
Unearthed-The Blancs Had Pro.
cured and Sharpened
Two Files.
While on their way to the city the other
day the 3lanc brothers told Sheriff Brous
sard that if he would go to Col. Boudreaux's
plantation and search a certain spot in th e
ground he would find a sharpened file, sim i
lar to the one shown during the trial. That
they had two tiles and had buried them
with a few feet of each other. The one to
the south, the brothers said, was the in
strument used to kill Mr. Begnaud. Acting
upon this information the sheriff went to the
place indicated and without much trouble
unearthed a well-sharpened file. Accord
ing to the Blanc's statement this is the file
with which Mr. Begnaud was stabbed.
They stated to the sheriff that they had pro
cured two files but found it necessary to use
only one.
No Damages.
The Supreme Court has reversed
the judgment rendered by the dis
trict judge on the verdict of the
jury in the case of A. O. Durvernet
vs. Railroad Company. The Su
preme Court held that it was con
tributory negligence on the part of
plaintiff, then a passenger, to have
taken the route or passage-way along
the train after having seen that
there was being unloaded from the
baggage cars trunks, etc.; that un
der the circumstances he should have
taken the other passage-way, and
the railroad was therefore not re
sponsible for the injury inflicted
upon him by an employe of the
road when he threw a trunk
In the passage without warn
ing, and by which the injury
was inflicted.

ROW ON ROYAL STREET.
Sheriff Broussard, of Lafayette,
Attacks D. C. O'Malley.
Times-Democrat.
At I x o'clock yerterday morning,
on Royal street, near Canal, Sheriff
Isaac Broussard, of Lafayette,
struck D. C. O'Malley on the head
with fist and, according to Brous
sard, knocked him into the street,
where O'Malley fellon his hands
and knees while his hat rolled into
the street.
Sheriff Broussard, when inter
viewed, said:
"I did not know O'Malley by
sight. He had been described to
me, and I.thought I would be able
to recognize him from the descrip
tion. I had been to the Parish
Prison to see how my prisoners, the
Blanc murderers, were getting along.
It was a little after a x o'clock when
I turned into Royal street
from Canal. When I met ex-Sheriff
Remy Klock he was in company
with a party whom I believed was
O'Malley, frota the description, but
I was not positive, and I did not
wish to ask any one, so spoke to
Klock and instantly hbe said, "Let
me introduce to you Mr. O'Malley.
I asked, 'Is this D. C. O'1Efalley?'
Klock said, 'Yes.' With this re
imark I turned on the man struck
with all my force I could command,
remarking, "You are - - who
lied about mel' Klock caught my
left arm, which broke the full force
of the blow, but O'Malley neverthe
less reeled into the street and fell
on his hands and knees, his hat
falling from his head. I saw the
man was frightened and white as he
could be, and he showed no signs
of resenting the insult. I did not
do anything further, but as the
police approached O'Malley got up
and said: 'Yes, I will denounce
you again.' I said: 'Gentlemen,
just stand away from me for a
second and I will show you how
long that,individual will stay there.'
The police then remarked: 'Don't
blockade the banquette,' and
walked off with Sheriff Klock.
"I had made up my mind to hold
O'Malley to an account the first
time I met him. To-day was the
first time I ever saw him to know
him."
