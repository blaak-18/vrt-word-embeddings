OOVERMENT SEEDS,
The People Wanted to Get. Some
Seeds, but they were Fooled:
A very clever "April fool" was played by
some parties in Lafayette last Monday. It
had been published that a government of
ficial would be at the post-office between the
hours of 9 and rz to distribute seeds. Little
thinking that a joke was being perpetrated
upon them a large number of people called
at the post office at the appointed hour and
seeing nothing that looked like seeds they
proceeded to propound numberless questions
to the post-master about the agent and his
seeds. The post-master who was bent upon
having all the fun possible out of the un
suspecting victims, answered that the agent
had not yet arrived, but would in all proba
bility put in an appearance later. Some of
the seed-hunters were detailed to different
places were they where told branch agencies
had been established by the government.
This somewhat cleared the post-office of its
visitors, but they were soon re-inforced -by
people from the country who were not dis
posed to be outdone in the free-seed busi
ness. By this time the post-office people
were geting tired of listening to the griev
ances of the many persons who had been dis
appointed, and as they had enough of this
thing to last them for some time, they inge
niously posted up a piece of paper which
stated that the place of dis'ribution was
at Paul Demanade's store. It is need
less to say that this gentleman was besieged
with visitors who wanted government seeds.
One gentleman was very anxious to get some
and left word at the post office to keep his
share should the agent show up. Later in
the evening a neat box was sent to him, but
imagine his discomfiture when the opening
of the box disclosed to his eyes the not very
elegant form of a mud-cat. After this he
"took a tumble" and now the first man that
says "'seeds" to him lays himself liable to
criminal prosecution for insult and abuse.
A number of other jokes are reported and
really Lafayette has distinguished herself in
the celebration of "all fools' day."
TO NOMINATE A TICKET.
A Democratic Mass Aleeting will
be Held at the Courthouse
Wednesday Night.
The Gazette is pleased to see that
the municipal election this year will
mean something else besides the
selection of a marshal or constable.
For many years the candidates for
the office of marshal have selected
those who were to be in charge of
our municipal government and all the
interest centered upon the man who
would be elected marshal. This
is, to say the least, not in accord
with the spirit of progress which
should prevail in all well-governed
municipalities. WVhen Lafayette
was a small village such a condition
of affairs was certainly not desira
ble, but now that the town is put
ting on metropolitan airs it is ex
tremely deplorable. Our mnunici
pal dog has grown too big to be
wagged by the tail. Aside from a
party standpoint it is right that
the voters of the town should have
a voice in the selection of their
councilmen, who must be men of
good sense, business ability and
practical experience. They are
haot selected for the sole purpose of
appointing Mr. Jim or Mr. Jack
to the office of marshal. What
would thewvorld think of the Amer
ican people if the one and fore
most issue in a congressional elec
tion would be the appointment of
Mr. Smith as doorkeeper of that
august body? We want mnen of in
telligence and men of integrity who
will accept office with the determin
ation to do their best not only in
the selection of a marshal but also,
to improve the town, and the best
way to get such men, is for the
voters to meet and select them.
These are some of the reasons why
The Gazette gives its humble ap
proval to the action of the citizens
who have signed the call printed
below. It is addressed to the white
Democrats of the town and the pur
poses of the meeting are set forth
in it.
The Gazette is also glad to see
that the meeting will be Democra
tic. To this no sincere Democrat
should object. No one who be
lieves in the principles of that party)
will refuse to sanction a move
ment that is intended to perpetuate
those principles. Iet the meeting
nominate a ticket composed of
god men and true Democrats and
evcry Democratic voter will feel
safe it giving his surpport to it.
The lines are now clearly drawn
and the voters will be able to vote
the Democratic ticket or against it
as they may be inclined politically.
They will know that if the Demo
cratic ticket is elected, it means a
Democratic administration in all
the departments of the town govern
ment, there being good material
within the party to fill every posi
tion. On the other hand if the
enemy should place a Republican
ticket in the field, or any other tick
et without that political cognomen,
or even one without a name, the
lines being well drawn, each indi
vidual twill know that in voting for
it, he is voting agntinst the Demo
cratic ticket and against a Demo
cratic administration. In other
words we will All know where we
stand and how to vote. We hope
all Democrats who believe in party
Siccess and party organization will
attend the meeting. Here is the
call.
LtAFAYETTE, LA., APRIL I, 1895.
To tIe tWhite Demotals- of the Town
of Lafayette.
Believing that the selection of
the Mayor and Councilmen to
be elected in May 1895 and subse
quent elections should be made by
the people, we, the undersigne'. De
mocrats of said town, do hereby, in
the absence of a regular organiza
tion of the Democratic par ty in and
for said tawn, call on all white De
mocrats therein, without regard to
past factional differences, to assem
ble in mass meeting at the Court
house on Wednesday, the loth day
of April 1895, at 8 o'clock p. m.,
then and there to nominate a De
mocratic ticket for Mayor and
Councilmen to be elected at the
May 1895 election , to permanently
organize the Democractic party in
said town, and to act on such other
matters as may commend themselves
to their consideration for the good
government, advancement and pros
perity of said town.
Respectfully.

The faby Show.
What about the baby show sug
gested by The Gazette some time
ago? Since we made that sugges
tion we know of several fine acqui
sitions to our baby population.
Lafayette may be behind her sister
towns in fire-protection, electtic
lights, street cars and other modern
improvements, but when it comes
to babies she stands first on the
list. Why not have a baby show
in connection with one of the
school entertainments? Though
neither of our professors have been
blessed with these exquisite joys,
we have no doubt that they will not
be slow to recognize the fact that
an entertainment by the little
cherubs will be a source of profit, a
"thing of beauty and joy forever."

Had Been Heading Ingersoll.
One of The Gazette's typ6s got in
his work last weem. In the local
notice announcing the union meet
ing at the Presbyterian church the
editor's copy read: "The services
will be specially directed toward
the dissemination of Holy Writ."
But the typo would have it his way
andti made it appear as follows:
"The services will be specially di
rected toward the d.ss:i'muiztion of
Holy Writ." WVe could not ac
count for this unpardonable mistake
but we have since discovered that
the typo had been reading Inger
soil's lecture on the Bible delivered
at St. Louis on March 24. Here
after all religious matter will be
printed by another typo.

what is claimed for them and the dealer

HOTEL ACCOMMODATION.
Lafayette Can Hold up its End
with any Town in the State.
Whate-,er else our beautiful city
may be behind the times in, we can
confidently hold up our heads with
any city in the State as regards the
provision that we have for travelers,
pleasure seekers, or business or
political assemblies. There is, per
haps, no other hotel in the State
that can provide better accomoda
tion for its guests than can be had
at the Crescent Hotel in this
city. The rooms are so arranged
that they can be let en suite or sin
gly, while the beautiful and tasteful
ly arranged gardens that surround
the building, and which bloom un
der the careful superintendence of
Mrs. Hahn, the worthy helpmate of
the genial manager of the hotel,
cannot ibe- excelled; and visitors
while delighting their visual organs
with the pleasant prospect, inhale
the glorious fragrance of the sweet
scented flowers which adorn the
walks leading to the hotel.
But from a purely business point
of view, the Crescent Hotel
is of immense advantage to Lafa
yette and the surrounding country.
Through its agency the principal
newspapers of the Union are dis
tributed throughout the district, and
the news of the world is dissemi
nated, keeping us in touch with our
fellow mortals in foreign climes. It
moreover gives regular employment
to about two dozen people all the
year round, while it distributes in
the city and surrounding coun
try about $rooo a month on the
average. It has had as many as
izo people to dinner at one sitting,
and on the occasion of the Foster
Adaras combine it found no dif
ficulty in accomodating and enter
taining 150 persons without unduly
taxing its ordinary help.
Now, all these results could only
be brought about by good manage
ment, and the proprietors of this
concern were wise in their choice
when they selected our esteemed
fellow-citizen, John Hahn, to fill
that very important position. No
better selection could have been
made. Mr. Hahn is a veteran in
the employ of this company since
its organization in 1882. He
served them well and ably in the
Junction House hotel, in Hearne
City, Texas and recognizing his
rare good qualities and business
ability, the company considered it
would be best consulting its own
interests by advancing him to this
position, and their predictions have
been fulfilled far beyond the most
sanguine hopes.
But Mr. Hahn is not only a
veteran caterer. He is a veteran
in the truest sense of the word, in
the sense that endear him and all
who took part with him to the
hearts of the people. For when the
South was oppressed, and our sunny
land was being laid waste by the
North, Mr. Hahn was one of the
foremost to take up arms in her de
fence, and nobly he fought with the
Third Mississippi regiment of the
Army of Tennesse, until he was
made prisoner and forced to
remain at Camp Chase, Ohio.
But that is now all forgotten, and
visitors from the North are cordial
ly welcomed by the genial host and
the hands of friendship extended
to them. Long may he and his
pleasant helpmate live to preside
over the destinies of the Crescent
Hotel and provide entertainment
for hungry wayfarers and help and
sustenance for hundreds of our fel
low-citizens.
