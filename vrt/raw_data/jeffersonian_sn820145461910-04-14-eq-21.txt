In this day of specialists when
every man makes a specialty of some
subject, it is naturally evident to the
lay mind that a Cancer, Blood and
Dropsy Specialist is a man that has
made a specialty of these subjects.
If you are a sufferer of Cancer,
Dropsy or any diseases of the blood
you would not consult an oculist
would you? Then, if you are afflict
ed with any of these dreaded dis
eases, why not consult a man whose
remedy first cured himself, and was
then offered to the world? This
remedy is manufactured and sold by

Laurens County’s “Mixed”
Missionary Meet
The Layman’s Missionary Con
vention, held recently at Dublin, was
bum. IT WAS ENDED BY AN IN
SULT TO THE WHOLE SOUTH. It
seems that they must be getting
short of funds, by the way, they keep
clamoring for the “dough”.
Social Equality has at last reached
our doors, right here in our own
good land of Georgia. Into the Court
House of Laurens county plunged the
negroes of this city, taking seats be
low the gallery, just as gay as any
white man. We saw one negro school
teacher, who was trying to keep
some of the other negroes from get
ting insulted because they were kind
ly asked by the pastor of the Meth
odist church to take seats on the gal
lery, in order that as many white
people could get in this social equali
ty game as possible.
We didn’t know that a negro was
going to speak to a white audience,
or we would not have gone. We
heard that a missionary from Africa
was going to speak, but we didn’t
know that a black brother of the
pastors from AFRICA was going to
speak to a white audience, much less
to a black and white spotted one, or
we would not have gone. We saw a
large crowd going in and we decided
that we would see what the attrac
tion was, what points they were go
ing to carry out and see how they hit
Thos. E. Watson. We were eager to
know what they were going to do,
and see how they exaggerated the
number of converts they received
last year, but we came out disap
pointed as to this fact.
The meeting was opened with
prayer and song, in which all were
requested to take part. The second
song, entitled “All Hail the Power
of Jesus’ name,” which the negroes
hesitated to sing at first, as if they
knew that they were out of place.
Then the pastor of the Methodist
church rallied them and gave a shout
and told them to sing, that they had
the right to sing as much as anybody.
All the white people were stopped
and the negroes took the second
stanza and sang, and on the third all,
including the whites and blacks, sang
together. “Ah! de niggers sung de
song, and de white fokes jined in de
cho’us”. Never before was there as
much disgrace as to hear such sing
ing. It sounded like a pack of
hounds after a coon. It was terrible
to hear the gross voice of a “feig
Buck Negro” with the dear white
ladies and young girls of our South
land. It seemed more like being in a
minstrel show than being among
God’s people. The preachers, seeing
that they had the white people by
the hair of the head, put as much so
cial disgrace on them as possible, or
while they had the advantage they
used it. Well, this was enough, but
we didn’t know that anything else
was coming that was worse than what
had already happend or we would
have gone; any way, we decided to
stay and catch the rest. Down on the
“bench” with the two pastors (Bap
tist and Methodist) sat old George
Linder, an old negro preacher of
this city, together with the colored
brother of the pastors, just as im
portant as any of them. After the
song the Baptist pastor led in prayer.
He thanked God for the spotted au
dience, for he said that we would be
in glory together and we just as
well be together here, and God loved
one as well as the other, and that
we might just as well love one as well
as the other. He prayed that God
would stop the pen of the poor de
nouncing writers who were writing
against the true Gospel of Jesus
Christ, and that God would have
mercy on the poor denouncing writ
ers. He just told them by his ac
tions and talk that they were just
as good as the white people, and to
take part the same way.
After the prayer the black brother
from Africa was introduced by Rev.
Jno. M. Outler, pastor of the Dublin
3affersonlan
Methodist church. In his introduc
tion he stated that the day reminded
him of the day when some great
Bishop set out to Christianize the
world (we have forgotten the name
of the said great Bishop), as he saw
the two great important races of the
South assembled in one great body
to hear the Word of God. HE also
stated that it gave him great pleas
ure to introduce this colored brother
of the pastors to a black and white
audience, also he hoped that the mes
sage was direct from God; or, in
other words, it was a pleasure for
him to introduce Social Equality be
fore this spotted audience. All the
introduction demanded was heartily
given by the introducer.
Up came the negro missionary
with a very horrid feeling, for he
knew that he was out of place. “I
will only give you a short story, and
in a few words, lest I worry you”.
To tell the truth, this already
was enough to worry any sensible
man. He went on and told of the
homes in which his tribe lived, what
they had to eat, and how they fared
in Africa. He stated that they had
grasshoppers and grubworms to eat
at marriage feasts; instead of whip
ping the children, as Americans do,
parents cut off a toe, a finger, an ear,
or an arm or leg, this being how he
happened to become a Christian mis
sionary by escaping punishment and
running upon some white people on
the coast of Africa, who took him,
brought him off and educated him.
We believe that he told this in order
to stir up and arouse the people, and
to get the funds to civilize them at
America’s expense. Well, we guess
this is enough of this brutal gas.
We had about as much of this gas
as we wanted to stand and we chang
ed our positions, part of us staying,
part leaving. After part of us left,
part remaining, white ladies went up
and shook hands with this black,
charcoal colored brute and bought
his book. Now isn’t it a shame to see
the motherhood of our Sunny South
land go up and shake hands with the
black brute, not knowing what the
result would be? Just shake hands
with anything that comes along
because they believe in the preacher,
and the preacher tells them that they
are right, and leads them into Social
Equality without any redemption
whatever. We are sending you this
because we believe that you would
like to know it. This would jar a
dead man if he only knew it. Per
haps you would like to know what
the Layman’s Missionary Convention
consisted of. We are all young, but
we believe in the charcoal colored
brothers of the pastors staying in

was a sample package handed
me. They relieved the pain
so promptly that I have never
been without them since. I
have given them to many

with neuralgia in my head,

me of neuralgia. I would not
