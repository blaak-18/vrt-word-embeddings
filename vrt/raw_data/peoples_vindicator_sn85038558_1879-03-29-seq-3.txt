O'LANO 2:40 ON THE SHELL ROAD-A I
FIRST-CLASS LIVERY, FEED AND
SALE STABLE TO BE ER CTED
ON THE RIVER FRoNT BY
TWO WELL KNOWN
HORSEMEN.
Capt. Samuel Hynes and Mr. R. P. Hut
son, both residents of tbhis city, and by
profession manipulators of equine lesh, t
petitioned the City Conncil last Wed- '
nday tosell or lease them, fora period
of te years, one hundred and fifty feet s
front by a depth of one hundred and 1
forty feet of the batture or river beak I
fronting on Cane river and opposite St I
Denis street and the said one hundred t
and fifty feet to run parallel with Front I
street, and that the petition be referred a
to some proper committee with the view I
of carrying into effect the above propo- '
sition. f
Capt. Hynes in a few brief and well- I
pointed remarks explained to the mem
bereof the City Council that be had in- I
terviewed all the property holders in that e
locality, and all were in favor of this l
new enterplsee. Hisobject and that of I
his partner also was to eSeet such a build- i
ing here, for a livery and sale stable, i
that would be an ornament to the city, i
and one that would place a revenue in 1
the city cofe; .that in no way would it i
interfere with the sanitary regulations 1
of the ity, and if they faded to keep the
premises surrounding the stableCleas , the
city had its police to enforce the sanitary 1
laws. The petition was referred to ai
committee to take consideration in the
matter, and report same at next meet-.
ing. We understand that the commit- 1
tee will report favorably on these gen
temer's petition, leasing them the river I
front at $100 per year.
