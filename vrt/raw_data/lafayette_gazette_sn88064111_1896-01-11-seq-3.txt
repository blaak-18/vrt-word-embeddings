t MR. ZELL'S PLAN
To Give Lafayette a System of
Waterworks and Electrie
Lights.
The people of Lafayette will soon
have an opportunity to say if they
want waterworks and electric lights.
At its last meeting the City Council
adopted a resolution authorizing the
committee to advertise for bids tor
the construction of the proposed
plants in accordance with the plans
and specifications of Mr. Robert R.
Zell, the engineer whose services
were engaged by the council some
time ago. We understand that the
committee will act at once and will
lose no time in advertising for bids.
At its next meeting it is very likely
that the council will authorize the
mayor to issue a call tor an election
to obtain the sense of the voters
as to the levying of the special 5
mill-tax for two years which will be
necessary to raise the required
funds. In the meantime the com
mittee will be at work on the bids 1
and it will be in a position to fur
nish all information in an intelli
gent and comprehensive manner.
The system of waterworks as de
signed by Mr. Zell is what is known
as both direct and storage. There
will be a compound pumping en
gine that will litt the water from the
wells and pump it direct into the
water-mains underneath the streets 1
and also into the water-tower to
which the mains will be connected. I
This tower, which will be built of
steel plates riveted together, will be
x2 feet in diameter and a25 feet
high; it will hold over zoo,ooo gal
Ions, giving a pressure of 35 pounds
per square inch, which will throw a
stream of water zx feet from the end
of a YX-inch hose nozzle, but this
can be increased when the pump is
delivering direct into the street
mains. There is to be 4x patent fire
hydrants with two s2-inch hose 1
connections on each hydrant. Mr.
Zell has laid out the location of
these hydrants so that all parts of
the town will be piotected, as can
be seen by the maps on exhibition
at the post office and at other places
in town. The maps furnished by C
Mr. Zell are very well gotten up
and show that they were drawn by a ,
man who understands his business
thoroughly. The specifications are t
also carefully drawn. t
The electric light plant will con
sist of two direct, connected high- E
speed engines, drawing two 30 -kilo C
dynamos of a capacity to furnish
both arc and incandescent lights
from on,- system of wiring. Two
improved safety boilers of 7o-horse F
power each will supply the steam. I
The combination of the water
works an-I electric light plants will I
reduce the cost of operation, as the
engines operating the plant can A
pump the water-tower full every
night, the boilers supplying both I
engines with steam at the same time.
The cost of operating a combined I
plant will be half of what it would
be if the plants were run separately.
With this system of waterworks it
will only be necessary to have hose
carriages to put out fires. In other
towns the people have successfully
fought against fires with plants simi
lar to the one which we hope to
have in the near future. The mains
will be constructed of standard iron c
water-pipes, coated with asphaltum. a
The facilities for the supply of
water will be excellent. The water
to be had here is of a superior ,
quality; it is pure and soft, and for g
washing and culinary purposes it is s
unsurpassed.
Mrs. G. E. Von Hofe and little a
daughter, Olive, of New Orleans, c
will be in Lafayette within the next L
few days. They will be joined here d
by Mr. Von Hofe. c

The Lone Star State has long
proved a fertile theme for the pens
of the author and playwright. Prob
ably no country of any age can fur

stories, and its heroes are classed

tory. It is a fitting tribute that the
gifted son of a sister Southern State
shouhl be one of the greatest im
personators of the heroic deeds of
Texas men, and Mr. Albert Taylor,

ceived the highest encomiums from a
both press and public for his splen- s
did characterization of Jim Bowie,
one of the brave defenders of his
native country during the Mexican r

An Old Soldier's Recomnenda-c
tion.
In the late war I was a soldier in A
the First Maryland Volunteers,
Company G. During my term of
service I contracted chronic diar
rhoea. Since then I have used a
great amount of medicine, but when
I found any that would give me re
lief it would injure my stomach, un
til Chamberlain's Cholic Cholera
and Diarrhoea Remedy was brought
to my notice. I used it and will
say it is the only remedy that gave
me permanent relief and no bad re
sults follow. I take pleasure in
recommending this preparation to
all of my old comrades, who, while
giving their services to their coun
try, contracted this dreadful disease
as I did, from ecting unwholesome
and uncooked food. Yours truly,
