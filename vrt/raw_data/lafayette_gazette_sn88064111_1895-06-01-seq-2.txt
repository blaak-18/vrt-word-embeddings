ir A Good Temperance Story.
We fear the hotel clerks who would do as
this one did, are not in the majority. The
witty thoughtfulness of the act here de
scribed, entitles the doer to be called more
ar than "genilemanly."
a About a year ago eight or ten lumlber
a men went into a hotel in one of our WVest
n ern cities, and engaged a private parlor.
They were jolly, well-to-do fellows, and
met to settle up a year's business over a so
cial glass, having had a successful specula- nC
tion together. Summoning the gentlemanly _
r clerk of the house, they ordered him to
it bring in the choicest liquor to be obtained,
-"nothing but the purest and finest
f article." a
The table was spread, glasses brought fo
out, and mirth and jollity prevailed. Pres
- ently in came the clerk with a silver pitcher
t of ice-water, and, as he filled each goblet,
with quiet dignity, and not a smile on his
countenance, he remarked, "Gentlemen, I on
have done the best I could to fill your order, an
and here is the purest article to be found in n
the United States."
All looked on in dumb amazement, so
unexpected and so ludicrous was their po
sition. But they were equal to the occa
sion. Not a word was said till each had S-i
his glass before him, filled with the spark
ling fluid. Almost simultaneously they all
raised their glasses, and pledging each SE'
other's health, made the additional one of
1 promising not to drink anything stronger
for the year to come. Nearly twelve Gr
months have passed, and they have been
loyal to their vow. May we not hope that wh
the pledge may be renewed for life. Ca

Municipal officers and State officials are Lot
nominated by the saloon. Nominating con- Cot

the liquor interests. Each saloon on a aver- the
age controls ten votes--a power balance that coo
makes rum-rule inevitable. The great pair- any
ties understand this fact and act upon it. mer
The rum power must be placated, not of. ner

not excluded from power. It has its price the
