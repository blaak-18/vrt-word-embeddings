This enterprise of our citizens should it
receive the active encouragement of our ft
people and lovers of good music. The ti
members of the hand ptopose to employ i
a most competent instructor, and enli
ven our little city during the summer
months with those beautiful strains ii
which will banish all ideas of "`reason, T
stratagem and spoils" so eloquently re
spoken of by England's immortal Bard
Shakespeare. Ladies and citizens let as
encourage the "boys" and be it u t said T
that yon have not music in yourselves.
Many things are wanted-instruments,
aid, encouragement. Natchitoehes is
equal to any emergency and after the
late emeate she is not expected to be
backward in aiding this new enterprise.
Already it is understood that the mem.
hers of the excellent string band, who a
furnished snch delightful entertainment v
in the saloon of the Bart Able, during ft
her trip to and from New Orleans, with ti
the "'bullsters" and their friends, will Ce
give a concery for the benefit of this en
terprise. In the mean time let our pa
triotic ladies move in the matter and a
complete nccess is innsured. They have
I ever been foremost in all that pertains
to public good and welfare and as in
'helumlln" times have risen superior to
the ancasion, no matter what might he

the new enterprise. The gentlemen of t

if true should not have been given to the
world anonomously It relates to a i1
marriage which took place in the city
some time since and which the VaIDn

banded in for publication. Whether t
this marriage was true or false; whbeth
er it was a sham or real, remains for fu

Two of Our 1815 Veterass.-Aa In
terestlg Meeting After their Sight of
e: Is Bestored to The* d
(N. O. Democrat, Feb 23.)
The military pagenant of yesterday th
must have stirred the hearts of the few ti
veterans now left, who so gallantly de.
fended our city against the advance of ft
I the British in 1815. Two that we happen
I ed to meet we know felt the old sol dier cC
. spirit come back when the "ear-piercing an
fife" seaunded on the street. Tlhese two h
a were Messrs. Josep St. Cyr and Charles la
e Roymoud. Pa
i, Mr. St. Cyr is eighty-two years of age, t
I and belonged to the rifle compaiy of the
I Bttallion d'Orleans, which was com- ee
i manded on the memorable eight of Jann to
I ary by Major Plauche. He is still an act- ce
ive itian, and moves ehest with the elas- or
ticity of youth. eh
Mr. Raymond is eighty-five, and was a nc
member of the same batallion in the bat- or
tle at Chalmette. Full of vigor said fe
- well-preserved strength, be, like this fel- re
low veteran, looks twenty ,years younger o
than he is. Both strange to say, enjoy el
conpanionship of wives they married six- Pa
tty years ago
e It was anteresting yesterday to listen ar
Y to their story of the battle, to note how to
e the eye would sparkle, and the chest as
e heave as they recounted the fighting of In
ty that day. Plauche's command was on Pr
the right, they said, and had for its pro- (
tection only a low breastwork of earth. [A
In the embrasures for the cannon there
were two or three bales of cotton, buat
' none in breastworks. The battle was tla
in hot from the time the first gun was fired,
ad s ntill the red coats withdrew from the g
tield. li
h Planche's command, Mr. Reymond says. at
le was composed of a rifle company, one of ce
dragoons, the Blues of Capt. Mannoel
White, the IA Franes and the Chasseours.
Of the whole command but six are now
a live, and they are C. Reymond, 8. St.
s Cyr, 8. 8t. Cya, Jean Gervis. Jean Lamo
r the and P. M. Laplee.
The occasion which brought about the
meeting w th these tried veterans was to
congratulate them on a new lease of life
a they had just received.
n For smonse years they were almost blilnd
fron eataract of the eye. and could barely
Stell daylight fthm darkness. The skill
fnl hand and kife of that eelebrated oe
t, nlist here Dr. Cornlius Beard, opened the
or portals of vision to those old soldiers,
and they see again. The cure mast have
o been wonderful, for nature at eighty-five
years has but little vital force of revivi
e cation left. Both were happy over the I
gift of a nse of which they were so long 0
bereft, and spoke of the doctor in a feel
e Ing manner, of his delicacy and extreme
is tenderaess. The doctor has, it seems,
been remarkabjW fortunate in all of his h
cuases of eatasset among elderly men. ci
e Our fellow townsman Adolph Dupre, *
e Eaq.. C. Toledsan and many others have
i been also restared to sight,
Mr. Dupre is one of the noblest exam- t
h ples of our creole stock. Sevety-eight i
in years of age, he has all tihe vivaeity of
his youth, and in eonversation is more
agreeable than those whose years falll
short of him to seore. His face isclas ae
siaesll and shows the true type of a Louis
d- isnan, and now that his sight is nearly
e" restored will enjoy for years to come the
. careases of his grandchi'dren. In 1815
he was too young to enlist in the cause e
y of New Orleans, but since our victory he
te has ever been a firm and unflinching de
ns fender of the people's rights.
