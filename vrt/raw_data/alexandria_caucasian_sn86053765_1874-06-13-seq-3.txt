advantages of Louisiana—and with iiitiuy
more and the undeveloped resourcesj we
find ourselves tho poorest, most oppressed
people on tho earth from liodical rule,
which in tho 8outli is ouly a synonilne for
villiany and ignorance
Tho question 1 lind agitating the minds
of our people, is, how is this to be done«—
That question settled and the intelligence
of thn State will bo united. Some advo
cate tho whites going to tho nogro or
radical party ; wo had au experiment of
tili« in the last Presidential election.—
Though Mr, Oreely had dono more for no
groo emancipation and with hopepofelevat
ing tho race, than any single man on this
continent, he wan unanimously opposed
by the, negroes, only because ho was sup
ported by tho white' man. In our local
elections negroes have been put on the
tickets, and tho effect has been to docroaso
the white vote. It Is plain, nothing can
be dono by conciliation". Again others ad
vocate the reorganization of the Demo
cratic party. Without discussing the
merits of thia party, let mo say right, here,
It brings with it prejudices and arouses
feelings so repugnant, that many of the
best peoplo will not sustain it, and furth
ermore the Democracy has not any de
mands on the intelligence and wealth of
the country, which aro not equally felt by
the whole peoplo opposed to tho tli«avish
miserable heads of tho dominant party in
Louisiana. That tho Democracy have
succeeded in many of tho unreconstructed
states is a fact gratifying to all of the re
constructed states; but hero nine-tenths
of tho white voters are opposed to our rad
ical rule, and ninety-niny hundredths of
the, negroes, with a few Carpet-baggers
and Scalawagors ( not. live thousand in all),
aro in favor of tho ruin of the Stato to
elevate themselves. So party liiQs aro
impracticable, as it will divido the whites,
thereby strengthening the ignorant negro.
The success of the Radicals in Louisiana, is
entirely due to his united action, and are
wo to continue to prove to tho world that
tho ignorant negro, hooded by tho misera
ble thievish Carpetbagger and Scalawag
are the superiors of tho Caucasian Kace,
with whom only in tho reconstructed
States there has never boon a competition.
The only thing nooossary for succès«, is for
the white race of Louisiana—to unite. I
liovo had even the ignorant negro to say
to me, "with all your intelligence and
wealth, you loose all of your influential
power, by your old dissentious of former
party prejudice, wtiilo tho 'icgro uniform
ly votes as the loaders dictates," How
often have all of us board the negroes say ,
**I knows what yon say is so ; but the word
fa (loite pataed and l' m oblige to voto tfio
ticlrft." 05
Lot tho white men array themselves to
gether, so that the ignorent negroes, the
timid place hunting whito and tho venal
politician, can see their strength and it
will bring ton of these to our ranks when
yon cannot obtain ono by all the concil
iatory persuasion and orri tory of tho gifted
Caucasian.
I now propose to prove beyond a ques
tion that the white people can snccooil if
they will only unite themselves together.
Do not let. yourselves longer bo deceived
by the redicnlons sophistry that, there is
no nse to make the trial because the whole
whito race will not do so at once. The
Radical party has been greatly and con
tinually strengthened by the fact that its
strength was in its uuion—all biîkerings
and divisions are always healed by tho
fact they, the negroes, know all is lost un
* less they become united.
When I present tho true statistics of the
last census (18701 to ni y race in Louisiana.
I feel assured they will blush for sliame :
for I tell yon aocording tho vital statistics
of the ninth oensus of the United States
for 1870, which was taken in tho interest
of Radical Party and in the heat of sum
mier, when thousands of our white citizens
had left poor Louisiana for pleasure,
health or business there was a majority of
white malee above the age of 31 in the
State of Louisiana. Snch is a fact, and
the figures prove it ai I exhibit

ceeded tho number of black and mulatto

plainly that tli'ero was a majority of

fact that at tlid time census was
takeu there was- at the lowest
calculation Ovo thousand voters
out of tho Stato giving tho control of

.A handsome majority. It has been four
years since this census was taken and wo
had a uiajoYity of minors which increases
our vote. Tho immigration of whites into
country parishes has largely exceeded the
enumerat ion ; the deaths of negroes rate
iu country parishes at least four to one
white, all in all, tho white voters must
have rncreasod over tho negro So all wff
want for success is unity. We cannot ex
pect all at one» to join iu ; but as 1 know
tho largo majority of whites believe our
salvation rests iu this party, let thorn
unite in a hand and as every white, lit to

: Our splendid weekly packet, Bart

and will accommodate the delegates in
any way.
Lot us hare the convention here.
" Tho carpet-baggers and negro pol
iticians are, and for some timo. past
have been, bnsily engaged in recon
structing their clubs and disciplining
their ho. des of negro dupes to porpot
uiito the fui nous reign of tho radical
party in Louisiana, and it is timo that
tho conservative elements of the Stato
weto taking steps to organize their
forces. This work cannot now be be
gun too soon, for there is a great deal
to bo accomplished. Wo havé not the
ileitst doubt of the ability of tho ele
ment« hostile to radical misrule to ftat
"ry tho elections if 0>«y can bo hariiao
ni zed aud concentrated with enthusi
asm upon any given lino of action;
and that is what now lies before us to
be done. Wo must combine and unite
democrats, reformers, liberal republi
cans and last-dftchers in one grand ar
my, inspired by a single purpose, a
common aspiration to redeem tho Stato
from tho power of men whoso infamous
rulo has brought disgrace, ruin and
misery upon it. The leaders, too, of
these several factions must bo brought
to understand that their political the
ories uro of secondary importunco to
the people, and tlfat if they risk or
threaten the harmonization of tho dif
ferent elements by their individual as
pirations, they will be swept out of the
way with very littlo ceremony. This
work, worujieat, should be begun with
out fnrther delay, for it must be re
membered that wo have very tow jour
nals through which to reach the people,
and thero is iu tho Stato scarcely a nu
cleus for nsto rally about; organiza
tion, therefore, will requiro timo and
labor^and wo ought to bo in the field.
Hut beforo anything can be dono a
State convention must be called, aud
the question arises, what authority or
what body shall call itf It seems to
us that the Committee of Seventy, the
Democratic Central Stato Committee
and the Fusion or Liberal Republican
Central Committco should unite in a
call for a convention. Tho call should
bo mado to tho whito citizons of the
State ; aud wo would suggest that an
early day in August bo designated for
tho assembling of tho convention.—
That will give timo enough for us to
discuss a plan of organization before
the meeting 0 .of tho convention, aud
time enough after it is held to concen
trate upon that plan tho elements of
tho State hostile to radicalism.
One olHho groat evils of conventions,
even where they aro tße representa
tives pf well organized parties, is that
they arc generally composed of so
many mon that they become mere mobs,
and tho worst possiblo nominations are
often made. In the proposed conven
tion it woiil® bo well to Obviate* this
evil, and we suggest that tho commit
tees, in their addresses calling it, re
commend that but two delegates be
appointed from each parish, and that
tho two bo empowered to vote in tho
conventionale representative stre^th
of their respective parishes.
As to the placo of holding ' the con
vention, wo sussest that Alexandria bo
designated. The peoplo of the coun
try parishes demand that tho conven
tion Rhall not bo held in New Orleans,
and if it is summoned to meet there, o r
near thero, very few of them will send
delegates. This is a matter of greater
importance, and upon which the peo
ple feel more deeply than perhaps gen
tlemen in New Orloans haye any idea
of, and we invite them to give it se
rious consideration. »
If such a convention as we have de
scribed is called, and at the place we
have designated; wo are satisfied that
a great end can be accomplished, and
that thft best elements oi onr popula
tion will como up squarely and en
thusiastically to the snyport of its
policy and its ticket.
In this connection, it is proper to say
that the professional politicians in this
contest must give way to an entirely
different class of men, or the whole
thing will be a dead failure.
Au effort should be made-to organise
tax-p$yef*' MMCMtlons, s ach as «re
hove in acd
pariah in the State, and these organisa-,
tions might see to tlife-'éppàhitineiit of
delegates to tho State convention, and
to the nomination ot candidates for the
parish officers and Legislature. The
organisation «f tl ta people of Louisiana,

not see, therefore, why they miglit not,
in this crisis at least, supplant and do,
the work of tlié ordinary primary
meetings and parish couventiont. We
are not 0 committed to this idea, bnt
throw it out as a suggestion for the
consideration of those interested.

Legend of a Lightning Stroke.
Baldwin, of the Ef Taso Journ
al has. heard of tho dire disaster
that recently befell tho office of Dr.
Smith when a red-hot thunderbolt
as targe ns a' hogshead dropped off
the telegraph wires plump upon
tho Doctor's table, 'striking terror
to tho hearts of the valiant ti'ckot
agent aud his friends, Baldwin re
lates the "horrible details" as fdl
lowS: Suddenly thero was u crash in
the office, and the wires lead fog to
the reading instruments were burn
ed in two, incited and lan down on
the floor. The lightuing had struck
the telegraph -wire somewhete a
bout Dwight, and followed it clear
to Bloomington, leaving the main
line and cnlmiuating in Smith's of
fice, where it produced the follow
ing effects: A Chicago-drummer
was pitched clear against theoppos
ito wall, face forward. 'Ihe blow
was so great that it made a clear
impression in tho solid plaster. An
ordinary man would have been kill
ed at once, but tha drummer had
run Ifis face so often that it did no
damage savea slight abrasion of one
ear. The doctor's clerk was stand
ding by the stove, frontiug the in
strument, with parted coat-tail.
He felt a peculiar and novel sensa
tion, as if a million needles had been
thrust into his heart. An examina
tion developed a curious phenome
non. Over tho telegraph instru
ment hung a printed table of the
freight and passenger rates on the
I., B. & W. It. It. By one of those
singnlar occurrences, tho whole
thing, including the frame and the
signature of J. W. Brown, the Gen
eral Passen wer Agent of the road
in Indianapolis, was photographed
on the young man's bosom. It is
prefectly distinct and legible.
VVbilo lie mantains a standing posi
tion it causes tho yonng man no
inconvenience rfhatovcr. Ihe
Board of Warehouse Commission
ers heard of this fact, and they im
mediately made him a Secretary.
In the suits about to bo brought
against the I., B. & W. R. It. he
will be put on the stand to prove
the signature of John W. Brown.
It is thought his testimony will
clinch tho case against the I., & W.
He is a worthy young man, entirely
dependent upon the t^certions of the
Commissioners for Iiis livelihood.
We hope he will bo successful. In
the meantime the electrical fluid,
in travelling about the office, struck
the private wire leading to Smith's
house saw it goiug, and taking his
eat rushed out after it. It follow
ed along tho wire, passing ono of
the horse-cars drawn by a mule,
l'art of the fluid went into the-mule
and tore the hair off of his tail.
The first thing the passengers knew
they were covered with hair and
the mulo wont nearly distracted,
braying. One lady saw the hair
and fainted, thiukiiig she had lost
her switch. On learning that it
was the mule's s witcli»she promptly
recovered. No other damage was
done.—[Virgini* City Enterprise.
