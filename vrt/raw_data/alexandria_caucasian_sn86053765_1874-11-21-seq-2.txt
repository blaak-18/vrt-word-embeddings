most excellent piece of workman

to have in one 's parlor or library.—
Every family should have tili* map

papers that owing to low water,
heavy fogs <N:e., she will make ten

HOLDING ON.
,
It is now nearly three weeks after
♦ ho election on the 2nd inst., and
fully ten days since they have bad be
fore them the fall returns, yet the
Returning Board has barely com
menced to count them at all, and are
evidently trying to spend as much
time as possible in the count. Now
that Jiongstreet has resigned and
Col. John M. Sandidge appointed in
his stead we hope that lie may be
able to hurry the balance of them
up. This delay is vexatious in the
extreme, is checking the new im
pnlso which was given to business
all over the State by tho knowledge
that wo had honestly carried the
State at tho election and is calcula
ted to have just the effect it is hav
ing of creating an uneasy, unsettled
feeling in tho minds of tho people.—
This uneasiness is not to be mistaken
for fear or for any backing down by
tho people from their determination
to have Ihn fruits of their victory in
spite of Kellogg and the Returning
Board. It means simply that they
are anxious to ofcape tho necessity
of taking tho matter in their own
hands. They have had a fair elec
tion with all tho election machinery
in the hands of their unscrupulous
opponents; they wero hunted by sol
diers liko common felons, driven
from home, intimidated, hand-cuffed,
imprisoned and insulted all for the
purpose of keeping them away from
tho polls so as that tho band of
thieves and plunderers should win
tho victory. In spite of all these
fonl wrongs which were heaped upon
them they voted any how and hon
estly, fairly won tho election.
Without a chance to cry "fraud"
because they had the whole election
in their hands and cut off from the
old dodge of "intimidation" because
they had soldiers every whero and
they wero the intimidators, the rad
icals are forced to admit their crush
ing, overwhelming defeat and like
Mark Tabley they are "waiting for
something to turn up" in their favor.
They are hanging like grim death to
tho flesh pots which have kept them
fat for eix years and are exceedingly
loth to give them up. They are wait
of
ing and praying for something, any
thing, to happen to change tho pres
ent aspect of affairs andean with dif
ficulty make np their minds to per
form their sworn dut}', when as it
happens in this case, to do so is to
commit a political felo de se. An
other Coushatta riot, any kind of dis
turbance iu the State would he a god
send to them. It would perhaps
again change public opinion North,
would givo Grant and Williams an
excuse for interfering to assist them
and to cheat us again as ho did in
1872. As matters stand wo havo be
sides a member on tho Board, a com
mittee in tho room to watch them,
and the Radical members must feel
liko tho man docs who is about to
commit suicide when they are com
pelled to sit down to a table and
count votes which will drive them
back to the insignificant holes from
which they havo emerged and which
puts their partj forever out of power.
We can very readily understand that
the duty is an exceedingly unpleas
ant one.
They hope to let the counting
"draw its slow length along" until
Congress meets on the first Monday
in December iu hopes that that body
will do something for them; order a
new election, get up a slow contest
as to seating some of our candidates
so that they may have the matter in
hand or some such desperate chances
as these.
Our duty is plain. We must keep
perfectly quiet for the present at
least, givo them reasonable, even un
reasonable time; allow them a fair
opportunity to honestly perform their
sworn duty and then take whatever
steps may bo necessary when we are
convinced that they do not intend to
givo lis fair play. For the present
let things remain in statu quo.
We won the election and we mean
to have the offices to which we have
fairly elected our candidates or Lou
isiana will bo tho liveliest place for
radicalism, swindling radicalism this
side of h —1. A knowledge that this
deep seated determination of all the
people may induce those tardy gen
tlemen to hurry up and may enable
the defeated radical candidates to
yield with some grace.
RAPIDES.
In onr last week's paper we in
troduced the subject of white immi
gration in this parish and.witbout
further introduction we will proceed
in this and subsequent issues until
we shall liave exhausted the sub
ject, to give such a detailed descrip
tion of our lands, products, people
other data as will be likely to at
tract without deceiving such immi
grants as may see our articles, and
induce them to cast their fortunes
with us.
a
the falls and bed biyeb.
Rapides Parish is so cal led from
tho rapids, or "falls" as w e cal!
them, which arc located just .above
Alexandria, the lower within half a
mile aud the upper about a mile
from tho town in the bed of Red
River. These falls which are no
more than rocky beds for tho river,
in low water seriously obstruct
navigation above Alexandria, and
for about three months in the Fall
of nearly every year make Alexan
dria tho head of tho low water nav
igation of Red River. During the
present Reason there was 110 com
munication above hero except by
means of the smallest of crafts who
ran down to tho upper falls and
took the freight which had been
brought this far lrom New Orleans
by larger boats, and they brought
down what cotton they could carry
and reshipped. This difficulty *>f
river communication abovo here
in low water makes Rapides parish
tho most desirable of any of the
Red River parishes for location.—
Below here on the river while they
have but little better navigation in
low water, they have most too
much of it when the river is high.
When they are overflowed below
here we escape that calamity here.
We have not had an overflow since
1S07 and do not have them oftencr
011 an average of once in ten years.
And even then it is only the river
bottoms and tho bayou swamps
back of the river which arejover flow
ed at all. Wd have bayou bottom
lands which are never overflowed
and all have a large area ot pine
woods lands which have not known
such a thing as an overflow since
the days of the big overflow when
Noah and his family alone escaped
the flood.
Red River used to divide Ra
pides into two pretty nearly equal
portions, the one South and the
other North of it, but the radical
and negro legislature eut off the|
upper portion of the North side and
put it into Grant Parish. The
character of the lands upon the
two sides were very different and
are now so. Upon the North side
there is only river bottom and pine
woods. On the South side, which
is now the largest, although they
took a slice from that side too and
put it into Vernon parish, there are
bayou lauds, river bottom and pine
woods. Wo will hereafter give des
criptions of all these lands in detail.

vboducts, crops, etc.
The three staple products of Lou
isiana, cotton, sugar and corn grow
here to the highest perfection. In
the cultivation of the sugar cane
Rapides enjoys a decided advantage
over the parishes North of us. Be
fore the war we believe there was
some sugar made in Natchitoches
parish, but since then we know of
none being made North of our lati
tudinal positiou. Even here the
cold is sometimes too severe for the
cane crops and early frosts some
times seriously injure the crops.—
This is, however, not so serious a
drawback as the cotton worms to
the cotton crop and cane is now ex
tensively planted ou the bayous
a
Robert and Boeuf and perhaps the
value of the can© Grop is equal to
that of tliê cotton crop ot each
year. ^The sugar plantations are
all located on tho bayous above
named and the Red River bflttom
and bayou Rapides which before
the war had its large sugar planta
tions, havo since the war been plan
ted in cotton and corn.
The low lands of this parish with
,i, fair treason and cultivation with
out tho use of manures produce on
an average of cane which yields a
hogshead of sugar, (1000 lbs.) and
two barrels of Molases per acre.—
This wo consider about a fair aver
age yield. Some times the yield is
as high as 1J to 2 hhds sugar to the
.acre and again it sometimes yields
it or hhd to the acre. This de
pends more upon the cultivation
and season than upon tho lands,
for any of the lands in cane will read
ily yield a hhd with an average sea
son and fair cultivation. We shall
hereafter havo more to say upon
the subject of our sugar crops.
An average yield for cotton is
one bale to the acre. The crop of
this year will be about that. This
also depends upon whether or not
we have the caterpillar, upon culti
vation ..etc, more than upon the
land, which will easily produce a
, .
bale to the acre witfa.proper oulti
vation. The yield of corn is about
thirty barrels or bushels to the acre
taking the average. Sometimes the
seasous are bad, the Spring too wet
or the Summer too dry and the
yield falls short, sometimes there
is an extraordinary favorable sea
son and the yield is thirty-five or
forty barrels to the acre. We use
barrel and bushel as synouimous
terms, our barrel shelling out a
bushel of corn off the cob. It will
be seen from this that our parish
is richly endowed with a soil of un
usual pioductiveness and that it
yields a substantial recompense for
the trouble and expense of cultiva
tion. Advantageously situated as
to water communication all the,
year around with our great trade
center, New Orleans, and with a
rich and productive soil in the low
lands and high and healthy pine
woods on both side of them, Ra
pides parish offers unusual induce
ments to the immigrant.
We shall hereafter take each of
thePsubjects of which we have writ
ten and treat of them in detail; our
purpose now being to take a curso
ry glance at the whole subject
which we have but partly accom
plished in this article. Tho limit
we have given ourselves in any of
the series is now already reached
and we shall leave the further con
sideration of the subject for next
week.
A P air of T hem .—The Chicago
Inter Ocean and New York Repub

all the other papers, North and
South are seeking to bury the ani
mosities engendered by the war
and are trying to bring about a
broad and expansive national feel
ing of security, peace and prosperi
ty, these two harpies, like carrion
crows are revelling in tho disgust
ing offal of their vile hate and are
using their utmost endeavors to
keep up tho persecutions at the
South. Bigoted, foul mouthed and
calions to the remotest suspicion of
generosity, they both givo full vent
to their spleen and would like to
see a reign of terror, oppression
and rabid hostility organized in the
South. With souls beside which
the immortal part of a flea would

carried down this trip to Mr. Oscar
Chopin, Commission Merchant, sev
eral tons of fine bermuda hay in
bales which was consigned to him
by our euergetic and enterprising
townsman, Mr. J. J. Goffe. The
hay was as fine as any we ever saw
and we know will compete with, if
not exell any that comes to New
Orleans from the West.
Mr. Goffe is in the hay busines
exclusively, and no doubt, finds it
to l»e a profitable one. This is one
of the branches of industry which
we desire to see developed and en
couraged in onr parish, and we hope
that Mr. Goffe will find a ready
sale for all he has on hand. His
hay took the premium at the Fair
in October and is in our opinion
superior to any that can be brought
here from New Orleans. Less cot
ton and more attention to these
kind of products will bring out our
parish. Let us encourage home in
dustry. Buy your hay from Goffe.
