It is with great pleasure that the
following article, “A Woman’s Views
on the Foreign Mission Question,” is
printed on this page. While address
ed to Mr. Watson, it was desired to
bring these views especialy before
the women readers of The Jefferson
ian, and to request that they give us
their views on the subject.
A WOMAN’S VIEWS ON THE
FOREIGN MISSIONARY
QUESTION.
With great interest I have read the
article on Foreign Missions, and will
say that it is to me the ablest article
I have ever read or had ever hoped
to read. However, it seems that there
still lurks in one human form the
spirit of Christ who dares to speak
the truth, reminding one of the ser
mon on the mount prepared by the
lowly Nazarene. It has always been
a mystery to me that we could afford
to feed and educate the Chinese and
other foreigners with our money,
when our own children and neigh
bors’ children were forced to grow
up in ignorance. Church members
have become disgusted and stay away
from church on account of the ex
penses assessed them by the stewards
and deacons of churches at the com
mand of the elders and pastors.
Twenty years ago I heard a good man,
a Christian gentleman, say that the
contribution basket ran him away
from the “'house of God” (?). The
reason I called this man a good man
is because I saw him die, and his last
words on earth were these: “When
I close my eyes in death, 1 shall dwell
with my Lord in peace forever.” But
for five years before he died he was
never seen to enter a church.
The writer has read and caused to
have read the article now wrote a
number of times, and not one single
instance have you been condemned
for your views. You only voiced the
sentiments of about two-thirds of the
church goers in the United States, the
preachers to t'he contrary notwith
standing.
If we only had more men who
could see wrong and point it. out as
you do and get to work to right it,
our world would be better. But may
be you have no axe to grind on the
missionary pay roll, as some of our
good brethren do who are so much
inclined to rap you so hard that the
lick might convert a heathen if ap
plied in that direction.
There is an old saying, ‘‘Strike
while the iron is hot.” Keep pelting
with your brickbats of truth till you
open the eyes of the blind. I agree
with you in 'helping in any good cause
and would give dollars now where I
once gave cents to help my home
land, since I have learned that all is
not gold that glitters in this honey
coated missionary scheme.
Respectfully,
Mrs. Beulah Joluiston.

When it is conceded that women
form at least two-thirds of the con
gregation of every church, and it is
'largely through their interest and ef
forts that the church is supported
and missions enabled to exist, they
should have the final decision.

Whatever they say will go.
Heretofore, all these long years,
women have “kept silent in/the
churches” until it is high time they
spoke out on all topics in which the
church concerns itself.
Not long ago I read of a minister
who explained the failure of men to
attend church to the fact that the
sermons preached were weak and
trivial BECAUSE THE WOMEN IN
THE CHURCHES MADE THEM SO.
I don’t believe any such thing!
Women have meekly attended
church and accepted whatever kind
of sermons were delivered, aided in
every good cause, so far as they un
derstood it to be a good cause, asked
no office, hall little voice in the man
agement of the church corporation.
It’s mighty poor appreciation, not to
We feel him in the passing breeze,
And there he whispers soft and low,
Like lover urging doubtful suit,
With tender music, sweet and slow; ,
Or mother humming to her child,
An almost noiseless lullaby,
That issues from her smiling lips,
Like tender soughings of a sigh.
We feel him in the pleasant wind,
Which from the Southland comes in
spring,
And with it brings the happy birds,
Which make/the budding woodlands
ring;
Or hear him whisper in the pines,
To other spirits of the air,
And see him marshal fleecy clouds
In phalanxes of.beauty rare.
We hear him roar, a demon wild,
As raging up and down the earth,
In company with vicious sprites,
He seems to burst with impish
mirth;
And lay about him, left and right,
As if he were a Vandal bold,
Intent to devastate the earth,
In league with Tempest, Storm and
Cold!
say utter lack of chivalry, that al
lows any preacher to get safely away
from his own congregation and then
“run down the women-folk.”
Women demand of men, even
preachers, little more than that they
be manly. And in consequence they
would not ask insipid sermons, and
the preacher who (Joes not express
his honest convictions must blame
himself alone. If he continues an
ancient error, disbelieving in it him
self, his is the cowardice, doubled, if
he imagines Jhe false position is
forced upon him.
I believe women want the truth as
Io religion, the truth as to economies,
the truth as to politics, the truth as to
life.
I believe they want men and so
ciety to be honest, not hypocritical. '
Press and pulpit are given as joint
powers for moulding public opinion.

used. If it degenerates into a mere
bolstering up of convential falla
cies a mere drivel of palliatives
when radical remedies are needed, it
is woe to this and future generations.
Let the women be heard, say what
they like and what they don’t like.
Silence on anything merely gives
some one who is not living up to his
duty the chance to whine that women
are at fault.
It is said young men do not care
to study for the ministry because
they are afraid they will not be al
lowed to preach w r hat they think.
Surely, surely, women are not re
sponsible for that!
The subject is not for the theologue
to determine. It is not for debate
among the members of the conference.
But it is clearly up to the people who
We hear him raging on tlie Main,
Like Neptune drunk with crazy
hate,
And see him lash the briny waves,
Till they reach up like hands of
Fate;
And in their fury try to seize
Whatever comes within their reach,
And like mad demons cast it up,
ATI dead and broken, on the beach.
He is the son of mighty Jove,
And Venus, who is queen of love,
And by his harsh and tender moods,
His parentage does clearly prove;
For only love could whisper low,
As does the gentle Southern breeze,
And only Jove-like anger tear
From out the earth huge mighty
trees.
He heeds not man in all his pomp,
But treats his puny strength with
scorn,
And scatters wide his grandest works,
Like feathers on the tempest borne;
Yet there is One, whose matchless
strength
His headlong charges can delay—
He needs but utter: “Peace, be still!”
And Ariel needs must obey!

gregation to settle. We women can
encourage fearlessness in the pulpit
just as readily as fearlessness any
where else.

kind of sermons do you like —the
comfortable, go-to-sleep sort, or the
ones that make you think, and think
ing, want to act?
This is an era of great wickedness
on one hand, and great spiritual un
rest on the other. The good in the
world is sufficient to overcome the
bad, if wisely directed. If we could
only concentrate on some definite,
vigorous policy, instead of having so

futile plans!
HOW TO DISCOVER BOOKS.
Have you ever tried to read a hig'h
ly-recommended book—a book that all
the people who ought to know said
very positively that you ought to read
-—and found that you could not read
it, that it did not appeal to you, that
to you it was dull, that it gave you
no new ideal, no inspiration?
I have, very often. Indeed, I once
almost despaired. I decided that I
must not be othodox, that my taste
must be poor, my judgment not good.
1 had patiently and dutifully endeav
ored to read the books —all that I
could get—which the college profess
ors and literary critics said one must
read to become well-read, broad, cul
tured. But many of them —most of
them, really—l did not like, could not
get interested in, could not make
friends with.
And then one day I came across
Drummond’s advice on reading and
selecting books, and it did me a world
of good. It was so refreshing. It
gave me new courage. It gives one
the chance to cultivate one’s own in
dividuality. He said, in part:
“Do not think that I am going to
recommend any such book to you.
The beauty of a friend is that we
discover him. And we must each
taste the books that are accessible to
us for ourselves. Do not ba disheart
ened at first if you like none of them.
That is possibly their fault, not yours.
Do not be discouraged if you do not
like time-honored books, or classical
works, or recommended books. Choose
for yourself; trust yourself; plant
yourself on your own instincts; that
which is natural for us, that which
nourishes us, and gives us appetite, is
that which is right for us. We have
all different minds, and we are all at
different stages of growth. Some oth
er day we may find food in the rec
ommended book, though we should
possibly starve on it today.”
