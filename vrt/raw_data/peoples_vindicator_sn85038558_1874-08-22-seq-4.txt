Ayer's
Sarsaparilla
Is widely known
as one ofthe most
effectual remne
dies ever discov
ered for cleans
ing the system
and purifying the
blood. It has
stood the test of
years, with a con
stantly growing
repntatiot?'based on its intrinsic virtues,
and sustained by its remarkable" cures.
So mild as to be safe and beneficial to
children, and yet so searching as to
etlectually pure out the great corrnu
tions of the blood, such as the scrof
ulons and syphilitic contamination.
Impurities or diseases that have lurked
in the system for years soon yield to
this powerful nutiulote, andl disappear.
Sll.ence its wonderfil cures, many of
which are publicly known, of Scrot la,
and all scrofulous diseases, Ulcers,
Eruptions, and eruptive disorders of
the skin, Tumors, Blotches, Boils,
Pimples, Pnstules, Sores, St.
Anthony's Fire, Rose or Ery
sipelas, Tetter, Salt Rheum,
Scald Head, Ringworm, and in
ternal Ulcerations of the Uterus,
Stomach, and Liver. It also cures
other complaints, to which it would not
seem especially adapted, such as Drop
sy, Dyspepsia, Fits, Neuralgia,
Heart Disease, Female Weak
ness, Debility, and Leucorrhoea,
when they are manifestations of the
scrofulous poisons.
It is an excellent restorer of health
and strength in the Spring. By renew
ing the appetite and vigor of the diges
tive organs, it dissipates the depression
and listless languor of the season.
Even where no disorder appears, people
feel better, and live longer, for cleansinu
the blood. The system moves on with
renewed vigor and a new lease of life.
