—the home of the Reformation! Now
let me give a fact or two that ought
to set people to thinking. Os course,
much of this work is necessarily
proselyting—not missionizing at all.
Is it any wonder the church loses in
fluence when it is guilty of such
folly? Proof: The General Mission
ary Committee of the Methodist
Church, held in Albany, New York,
last fall, considered the financial side
of the foreign missionary cause, and
decided on retrenchments in voting
appropriations for the different mis
sion field. The Mission Board was in
debt, and retrenchment was the way
out. The amount of $163,446 was
appropriated for missions in Europe,
about $40,000 of this going to Ger
many and nearly $50,000 to Scandi
navia. Now, Europe has had the
Bible since the Middle Ages—in the
vernacular, and since the Reforma
tion has been a powerful factor in
civilization. Why, then, this $163,-
000 for the “conversion” of Luther
ans, when there are millions who
know not the name of Jesus in the
Far East? Why did not this mission
ary committee of the Methodist
church retrench, cut out, the usual
appropriation for the conversion of
the followers of Luther and Zwingli
and put that amount in India, or
China, or Africa? Bishop Cranston
said: “We must save the world and
the Church from the blight of Ger
man rationalism by convincing the
Germans of the absolute need of a
real and true regeneration.” Let the
Bishop simply substitute “American”
for “German” in his own words above
and he will find more than his hands
full right here at home. Are we to
believe that the Bishop believes the
Germans have never been converted
before Methodist missions were es
tablished in Europe? From history
he knows that Germany is the home
of the purest religious motives and
truest piety the w r orld has ever seen.
But the key to the situation is bet
ter given by Bishop Burt, who said:
“All your work in the rest of the
foreign field depends upon the suc
cess of your work in Europe. Talk
of the work in Africa! We must get
control of the nations that govern
Africa. We must Cliristianize Eu
rope!” If this isn’t fanaticism, what
is it? Again, I would suggest the
substitution of another name in place
of “Europe” in the quotation from
the Bishop. Why did he not say,
“We must Christianize America?”
For, as America goes, so goes the
world, so far as genuine civilization
goes. If America becomes the prey
of materialism and “rationalism” and
our boasted “free” institutions are
swallowed up by the irreligious spirit
of the times, then where will the
world look for another land of lib
erty—in vain?
I get these bits of information from
an article in the (Philadelphia)
Lutheran of November 25, 1909, con
tributed by Rev. H. D. Spaeth, of Al
bany, N. Y., who attended the above
mentioned Missionary Conference.
But I have one more thing to speak
of.
Is it not strange that many of our
clergy in advocating the cause of
Foreign Missions see the social and
“caste” evils in heathen land, and
can picture them in such lurid colors
as to arouse pity in any sympathetic
heart; but so little is said in our
churches about the glaring evils of
our land —as though they had to be
—and the most the Church seems to
be doing to root out these evils is a
half-hearted condemnation, and the
application of a kind of “white
washing.” I can’t find a better term
' to use. If too much were said from
the pulpit by the whole ministry it
might seem to be “meddling in poli
tics.” Hence, there is much preach
ing of the Gospel in the abstract,
and not enough concrete application
of its teachings directly from the
pulpit.
. Much is made by foreign mission
aries of the deplorable condition of
woman in India, especially of the
Zenana system, which holds the
Hindu woman in social thralldom.
It is pitiful indeed! But how much
is the Church directly interested in.x
America, in the terrible, race-de-
stroying evil of White Slavery? Are
any churches or “home” missions
establishing any effective means of
escape from these dens of iniquity,
or is all this work to be left to the
police powers of the Government?
It seems that our churches ought to
find “missionaries” duly commis
sioned to go out into the highways
and hedges of our social Babyions
and compel the end of White
Slavery. I have little respect for the
zeal that would overturn social cus
toms in foreign lands when there is
lacking enthusiasm for the work of
destroying our own monstrous evils
that are eating the very vitals out
of our body politic. Let us hasten
the triumph of Gospel truth in
America —make our own land safe
first, else what shall it profit us to
gain the whole world and lose our
own America; lose it to Catholicism,
and social and political degradation
and ruin.

Comment.
(1) Yes, there are oceans of sin,
misery and illiteracy all about us;
but we can’t attend to our needy
folks and those of heathendom at the
same time; consequently thousands
of our mission workers and millions
of our money are giving the prefer
ence to the heathen.
We are even setting up hospitals
and maintaining missionary nurses
and doctors in those European coun
tries where Protestantism had its
birth, and where it is organized,
wealthy and powerful.
We are going crazy, I guess.
T 2) Ben seems to be all right. He
handles the searchlight very well, in
deed.
(3) Why do I not make a “more
concentrated fight on rottenness and
corruption and graft?”
Show me how, please sir. Have
filled the furnace with rosin, have
run up the steam gauge until the en
gineer is in a panic, and we are
thinking of hiring a nigger to roost
on the safety valve.
(4) Glad you liked the Bryan ar
ticle. Those are the facts.

WHERE IS THAT LAND TRUST?
Dear Sir: —We have some big
tracts down in South Georgia, in Cof
fee, Clinch, Appling and Ware coun
ties, some hundred thousand acres,
cut. into 490-acre farms at $4.25 and
$4.50 per acre. They are cut-over
lands, near railroads; in a few years
they are going to sell for from $20.00
to $30.00 per acre, just as the cut
over lands in Emanuel and other
nearby counties have done in the last
few years. A large body of these
lands could be bought with a moder
ately small cash payment, with a low
rate of interest on the rest.
Augusta, Ga.
The above is a portion of a letter
written by The Augusta, Ga., Real
Estate Company.
Anybody who is in earnest about
wanting a home could get one on
these terms, couldn’t he? Only
$4.50 per acre, a small payment to
bind the bargain, a long time on the
purchase money. I wonder why the
Land Trust doesn’t grab this 100,000
acres of South Georgia land.
The other day, a gentleman sent
me a list of names of foreign noble
men who had bought up big tracts in
America. The total of the holding
was something less than 6,000,000
acres. In glancing over the list, 1
recognized the names as the same
that were howled about, twenty years
ago.
The men who then talked
“land monopoly” pointed to those
3effersonlan
names, and prophesied that foreign
noblemen would soon own the coun
try. Whatare 6,000,000 acres of land
land to us? I see from. Pinchot’s
last report that the area of our
“Forest Reserve,” alone, is 194,505,-
325 acres! Why, the school lands
of Oklahoma amount to more than
3,000,000 acres; and that marveL
lous new State is eager to have peo
ple come over and take possession,
on easy terms. As to Texas, the
holdings of the foreign investors
would look insignificant.
There can not be a land trust in
this country.
In the Socialist articles, prepared
for my Magazine, I will show you
why.
WOULD THIS JAR YOU?
Dear Sir:—Would it be too much
to ask you to give me a number of
good points in favor of Home Mis
sions, and also a number against Fon
eign Missions. Are having a debate,
and would like any assistance that
does not cause you too much trouble.
Thanking you in anticipation,
Yours truly,

ALL SCOTCH ARE KIN.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson: —I here
with enclose to you a check of Mark
W. Munroe and one of George D.
Munroe for one dollar each, as a
subscription for each to your Wat
son’s Jeffersonian Magazine. They
are sons of a native of Scotland and
are descendants of the clan “Camp
bell,” of that country, with whose
fame and history you are familiar.
I have occasionally loaned to them
my Jeffersonian Magazine, in which
they have found several articles
which have attracted their attention,
especially such articles as your great
reply to Booker T. Washington on
the advancement of his race, and
your late articles on Socialism.
As descendants of the clan “Camp
bell” it is natural that they should
be indignant at the reported remarks
of Andrew Carnegie in relation to
the advancement of the negro race
in this country in comparison with
the condition of his race some two
hundred years ago. On this subject
I enclose to you a clipping from the
Jacksonville Times-Union of the 6th
inst. We hope, should it meet your
approval, that you will give us an
article in your monthly Magazine in
reply to the remarks of Mr. Carnegie,
somewhat of the style and character
of that of yours in reply to Booker
T. Washington.
I have taken a deep interest in
your writings ever since I first read
an article in your Magazine, some
years ago, and I am frank to say that
they give me more pleasure than any
other writings, except the Bible and
Shakespeare. Would that we had a
legion of such writers to revolution
ize and overturn the existing cor
rupt state of affairs in our country!
I take the liberty of enclosing here
with a copy of a letter written by me
on my last birthday (89th), and I do
this because you are familiar with
Lake Okeechobee and the region of
country surrounding it. If you con
sider the subject worthy of your at
tention, I wrnuld be glad if you will
use your influence in conserving this
great gift of nature to our State.
With highest regards,
Yours very truly,
R. W. WHITE.

Answer.
The Watsons of this country came
from the Scotch border, and all of
them that are ugly and red-headed
are kin to me. Whether lam Scotch,
or only near-Scotch, the Carnegie
statement got me riled, clear
through.
In the February Magazine will be
an article, in answer to Carnegie,
which I hope all Americans of Scotch
descent will read. I mean to mail
proofs of it to Scotland, and get it in
some of the Scotch papers. Andrew
will never hear the last of that
“break” of his.

HERE’S A BULLA’ LITTLE BOY.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I trust you
will pardon me, a thirteen-year-old
boy, for making a suggestion. My
suggestion is this: That you put up
your little grandson to debate the
Foreign Mission question with Mr.
Wm. T. Ellis.
Reader of The Jeffersonian,
HARRY L. CHASTAIN.
Ochlocknee, Ga.
Answer.
My deai’ boy, your suggestion does
credit to your head and heart. The
only thing needed to make the plan
complete, is the grandson. I haven’t
one. But if you will agree to repre
sent me in the debate, I will back
you to beat Ellis.
