I NOTI(CE TO ADYIVEITISER .
All defendants in judicial sales
have thell right to select the plulper
in whicii theil adllvertisement is to he
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a bid hbefore
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani

support it. Also those who enter
honesteadi s have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
PROHIBITION.
As we anlticipated in our issue
of last week, the police jury in ses
sion Wednesday, in answer to a
petition to that effect, ordered an
election to take place at the dliffer
ent polling places throughout the
parish on Tuesday, the 26th day of
February next, for the purpose of
saying whether or not whiskey
shAll be sold in the parish.
Thus far we were rejoiced at
their action, and had hoped to see
a quilcet campaign based upon rea
son and determined by principle,
and upon this line had expected
prohibition to prevail, and the
question to be out of issue by tihe
t'opening of the State campaign
next Fall, inl which will be issues
of such exceedingly greater impor
ttance as to overabadow it entirely.
But much to the surprise of our
self and many others, the police jo
Sry stepped entirely beyond their
powers and ordered that the result
t said elction, if favorable to
i prohibition, should take eleet from
aod afterthe 1set day ofApril next,
motwithitandlng ptate, parish and

ures adopted, itf not to create ex
ci temnent andl i'nater all ii,teiest in
this side issue which might have been
settlh-d by this paarish 20 years ago t
Listen! 20 years ago, and up to
3 years ago, the war and the ne
a ro, turnished all the campaign
thunder needed by demagogues,
and the People's party was unheard
of, and at that time an imnpossibili
ty, but recently-oh, very recently !
the people of this parish laid asidle
the war issue, and saw nothing to
fear from the negro, and voted
sensibly-for themselves-for a
man who eats bread in the sweat
of his face, just as they do, and
the parish was carried by the peo
pie for the first tit4e in 20 years!
And there was serious danger of
their doing it again ; and that too,
in an election where it would
count-where they have about
P100,000 worth of offices to give
away, and unless there can be
hatched up a side issue, and that
made intensely hot, so as to enlist
all sympathy upon one or the other
side, the people are just liable to
pick up some old one-gallus farmeer
and put him in one of these good
fat offices, and turn a lot of folks
out to graze.
When asked why lihe wished to
anticipate the law andi stop the
saloons before their licenses (con
tracts) had expired, and their
stocks were yet full and thus break
an honest man who was acting in
good faith with the laws of his
country, a police juror replied, that
we had as well break him as to
allow him to break the poor 4
cent cotton farmer.
This reply shows the demagogu
ery of the movement, while we be
lieve there are many good men in
the movement actuated by the
purest of motives, we will wager
that before the election in Februa
ry, farmers will be made to believe
that all their troubles are due to
the sale of whisky in this parish
and that the stopping of it would
snake this country blossom as the
rose.
Already the leaders of our party
areeranging themselves upon op
posite sides of the issue (T) and the
politicians are rejoiced and almost
frantic with delight over the ap
parent success of the scheme.
The illegal steps that are now
being uselessly taken will prolong
the fight in the courts until long
alter the next state election-long
after the politician has gotten what
he sets out for, the ofi8ces,-and
the farmer shorn of his strength,
can organize for 4 years more, only
to be side-tracked again.
Populists of Natchltoches, let us
appeal to you to exercise a little
common sense. Do not be drawn
into this fight. It will not give
you free silver, fair elections, nor
raise the price of cotton. We have
just come from a parish where we
lived for 10 long years under pro
hibition, and people are selling
cotton there now for 4 cents, and
silver so far from being free is as
scarce as hen's teeth. It gave us
nothing but prohibition and yon
have that already with present
prices.
We tell you in all candor (and
we might be an office-seeker if our
term of residence here would per
mit it ander the constitution) that
the issue we must solve for our
prosperity is, more money which
means better prices for our pro
dace, and fair elections which
means liberty.
NIow will you be sidetrackedt
Will youe be humbugged again for
the twentieth time in your lives
Will you split the People's party
into contending factions that can
not be healed before election? If
yeou do, the purpose (or the oppoar
tnealty at least) of the politician
will be accomplished. He will
walk of contentedly with the off
es and ye and your ebildren after
you will continuae to groan under
the latolerable baudens yeu are
now bearing.

MION rOMERY, LA., Jan. :r.
EDITOR POPUI.IST:
We can always tell when one
of the tools of plutocracy is hit
with a sound argumecnt, the latest
instance we have, being the bo
wailingnmoan sent up by the editor
of the Colfax Chroni lo. In a
communication from us published
in LOUISIANA POPULIST of a pre
vious date, we used the following
language:
"Will some of those delectable
gentlemen w ho harp so much about
the intrinsic value of silver, tell us
why a dollar sta:unlxl upon a piece
of silver of the commercial value
of fifty cents is not worth as much
as a dollar stamlred upon a piece
of paper of one cent commercial
value."
We suppose the braying ma
chine of the Colfax Chronicle con
siders himself one of these "delecta
ble(l) gentlemen," and therefore
proceeds to make a few sugges
tions as to what he calls our "il
logical assumption," and in his
narrow-minded ded agogry tell us
to take '"$1 each, of paper, silver
and gold money, and put it in a
good hot fire and he (we) will soon
discern the intrinsic value of each
substance."
If the assanine proclivities of
this "delectable(?) gentleman" as
portrayed in the above absurd and
nonsensical prating are to evidence
his-physical anatomy, then it must
he taken for granted that he (the
editor of the Chronicle) has no
head at all, but simply has a knot
tied in the upper end of him to
prevent his unravelling, but the
knot seems to be a failure, as he
continues to unravel all the same.
That the bullion in a gold dollar
is worth a dollar, is- a preposter
ous misreprcsentation. Were it
so; the absurdity of putting a dol
lars worth of labor into the mate
rial before it is ever coined is not
honest, and the Government that
insists upon doing so, is dishonest,
when it could make money of the
same value out of cheaper and bet
ter material, (paper), it is better
because it is more easily transport
ed than gold, and loses nothing by
abrasion.
"The delectable(l) gentleman,
after easing himself of a few more
"colic" pains by his "trial by fire"
admits that paper money is as
good as any money, if it has the
"faith" of the government to back
it; if it is not too much frazzled,
and if he will use that knot he has
tied in the upper end of his anato
my he will find that there is no
money unless the "faith" of the
government backs it, it matters not
what the material is. Then if the
frazzled end of his anatomical lo
comotion is not too badly wrecked,
and h'3 is not exhausted "hurrahing"
for the grand old Democratic party,
he will see that the government
faith can be attached to money is
sued direct to the people without
interest, as easily as it can be at
tached to the bank note at a high
rate of interest to the people. Now
as to burning "$10 each of paper,
gold and silver money." .Great
Scott! there is not one man out of
every hundred that could even try
the experiment, we venture to say
that the editor of the Chronicle
could not do it. Why that Is $30.
The delirious vagaries of our
"knot ended" editor reminds us of
the foolish maiden who was found
on the road side crying. as though
her heart would break, when asked
for the cause of her grief, she re
plied: "I was just studying, that
suppose a rank stranger was to
come along the road, and suppose
he asked me to have him, and sup
pose I told him yea, and suppose
we was to marry, and suppose I
was to have a baby, and suppose it
was a boy, and suppose we named
it "Tom," sad suppose it was to
hfall into a red hot fre, and suppose
it was to burn up-what in the
worldwould I do, boot bootl hoot
hootl To may the least of it,this
poor maiden's troubles were r
motn iadeed, but no more so than
those igured out for the farmer
by the "deuectable gentlemm." Let
s.pe, tsupposetbe farmer should
"pull" through without starving
or fmaming to death, and suppose
he bould he able to mae bfour
east e at, ad mappose he was to
lay up a vast ;,''n:mnt ('f mirvney. (is
there any deuti oi t!, ,i and sup
pose tli4 va:;t amtin~:: ;" nl''ney
is i'+, ?..k.,!\k t, + .3 :'lJ ' . i, ::!..' ,e:: l
condi,ti;',,.!. and suppIo thi4s i,:ose
was made of wood, (which is like
ly, unless the poon fellow is in jail
for begging a few crumbs from
Dives table), and suppose this far
mer should burn this house, (are
they in the habit of doing this?)
and suppose this vast amount of
money was burnt, what in the world
would become of the poor farmer.
We know this kind, gentle, gener
ous, delectable(?) gentleman has
lost many nights sleep grieving
over the sad calamities that are to
follow this very remote possibility.
But we have never heard of this
generous gentleman offering to re
lieve the poor farmer of the extra
$175 that he is unjustly taking
from them in a fraudulent printing
contract with the police jury, of
which he was the president. The
farmers have to pay this in 4 cents
cotton, and we think we very
safely advise our esteemed neighbor
that he can with all propriety cease
his worrying over the farmer "try
ing any of his money by fire,"
(even should his house burn), until
he is releived of all the infamous
jobs put upon him by the entire
government, parochial, state and
national.
The People's party will go into
power in 1S96, but until then the
farmer is likely to have nothing to
burn but rags and an empty stom
ach. We are at a loss as to wheth
er to sympathize with our neigh
bor or not, but we do say that if he
is non compus mentis he has our
deepest sympathies, and we advise
that he be put where, he can be ta
ken care of, but if his aim is to
tantalize the millions of people
that are now at the point of star
vation, (and we are satisfied he has
no other object,) then he should be
denounced by every honest think
ing man in the country.
To tantalize the people with
sophistry is to say the least of it,
worthy only of an imbecile (if he
knows no better,) and worthy of a
knave if he does know brtter.

CARTHAAGE, LA., Jan. 4, '94.
EDITOR POPULIST: - People in
this section are making prepara
tions to try to muake another
crop to give away to the banking
and trust companies of this once
free country. It seems as if there
were no balm in Gilead, and as proof
of the same, we are told in the Bi
ble that when the wicked rule the
people mourn. There is a general
uneasiness among the people, more
especially among the farmers, as
none can tell whether or not we
have yet reached rock bed, gold
standard bottom or not. Cotton is
selling at 4 cents and that is the
only product we have for sale that
*ill bring any money, and it costs
that to raise it, to say nothing of
gathering and marketing. I fear
if there is nothing done to alleviate
the suffering and distress among
the people, that we will have a
revolution by the bayonet, but
hope it will be by the ballot. But
the people are restless, and I fear
they will not wait for the ballot's
slow process, besides they will
have felt the power of money pit
ted against them in past contests.
Now, in conclusion I will say to
those that have read Gibbins Ro
man Empire, that we need a Rims
si, the TrbMas, to rouse the sleep
ing lethargy of this confiding peo
ple before it is everlastingly too
late. After wishing you a happy
New Year and best wishes to the
PoruLsr, I remain as ever.

Ediitor Clalibrne (Gluatrdian:
Dear Sir:-In view of th: wide
spread :estitution in ouir midst, is
it not wise to pause and inquirec
the canus., as there is no, :ect with
out cause ? There Ih", Iºen ,,w
much written and publihubL in ref
erence to the right mode of farm
ing, and so little heed taken by our
people, it seems useless to say
more; but in thinking of the con
dition of our whole Southern coun
try, (a land where want ought not
to be known, and would not if our
agriculturists would put common
sense into practice, for it is a fact
admitted by all that it is not best
to neglect grain and forage crops
in order to produce more cotton;
but, admitted as this is, it is also a
fact that a great majority of our
farmers do it), I am constrained to
give my views as to the proper
mode to farm. Having tried my
plan for the last twenty-eight years
and have not wanted for any of the
necessities of life, and having seen
so many farmers in that time who
have gone to the wall that followed
a different plan. I am established
in the opinion that our country
connot be prosperous if the farmers
neglect to raise provisions suffic
ient at least to run their own farms.
.It is common, too common, for
farmers to expect every year to be
favorable in all respects for grow
ing a crop. They make but few
calculations for a failure, but the
reverse. They all expect to make
a big crop of cotton, get a big
price for it, and as long as they
have credit, make a big account to
be paid when the crop is gathered
and sold. These are not safe calcu
lations. As long back as we have
any history to inform us, there
have been drouth, canker-worm,
mildew, locust, catterpillar, rain
and hail storms to blight and des
troy the labor of the husbandman,
and our own observation teaches us
(if we would but heed it) that there
are many causes in these latter days
to lesson the price of the fruits of
our toil.
My plan, Mr" Editor is this: I
plant grain sufficient each year, so
that if I only make a half crop I
have plenty; then I plant as much
cotton as I can cultivate and gath
er, not neglecting my grain to do
it. The gleanings of my grain
fields and peas raised on my corn
land (with but little work) insures
my smoke house to be full of home
made bacon, and at the end of each
year there is sufficient on the place
to make another crop, which has
cost me loss than the freight my
neighbor pays on the supplies he
buys to run his farm in cotton, and
the cotton I make does not belong
to a merchant the minute it is gin
ned and baled as his does, And
another thing I don't do as he (my
cotton neighbor) does, that is hunt
out the poor spots on my farm and
sowthem in oats or cultivate in
corn. There is no crop grown in
this parish that pays better for the
labor expended than does wheat
and oats, consequently I put them
on as good land as I have, and
have never made a failure of either.
And there is another thing I could
never find time to do in making a
crop or gathering it, that is to go
on those hunting and fishing expe
ditionsso common in our parish.
One to succeed in farming must
start right, then he must either
hold the plow or drive.
The time has been, Mr. Editor,
when a man .that was able could
hire his driving but that's played
out, and the new order of things
requires that the one most interest
ed must do the driving to succeed.
I know there is a great deal said in
reference to a certain class of labor
ers of our country. I think that
it would be more beneficial to the
country at large to say more in ref
erence to the guidance of that la
bor. I know that we have the best
labor in the world-the fact is, it
is the only suitable labor the south
will ever have, others' opinion to
thecontrary. All itneds isto be
rightly managed; and this can be
done only by example. Let the
land owners of the country who
employlabor take the supervision
of their farms in their own hands
and guide them as pilot does his
craft, always at his poet, plant and
cultiN ate more grain andl less ct
ton; in fact make -'iach farm self
suºport ig. T'[hen, andl not till

The lecture of Geo. . W. in at
the Comus hall last Friday night
was a splendlid effort. It was well
attended, and the Normal manage
uenut deserves the thanks as well as
the hearty patronage of this town,
tor the good these lectures are doing.
By reference to a call of the Peo
ple's Party Executive ('ommittee
of Grant parish, appearihg else
where in this issue, it will be seen
that an effort will be wade to cell
trol, entirely within the l'eoiple's
party, the Judicial offices In the 4th
district.
This is the first effort ot the kind
made by our party in the state, and
it may prove successful, that is a
Populist judge may be elected
in that district, but as there is but
one Populist lawyer there, our par
ty will have to induce some other
lawyer to join the party for the of
fice of District Attorney before it
can complele the ticket, and this
would be a bad policy to say the
least of it.
And while we might elect a ju
dicial ticket, we would in all prob
ability drive strength away from
us that would lose us several legis
lative offices of far greater inmpor
tance to our party.
Judicial otiers are necessarily
non-partisan, or should be-they
have nothing to do with the mak
ing or repealing of laws, and all
Populists desire of such officers is
ability, honesty and impartiality,
all of which we can get without a
bitter partisan fight which would
necessarily follow party nomina
tions. It the Democratic party
nominates a ticket, then will be
time enough for us to do likewise,
but until we get stronger and raise
up a few competent lawyers of our
boys, that we know did not come
into the party for office, we should
keep out of a partisan struggle on
this line until it is forced upon us.
We hope the Grant parish Exec
utive Committee will look well to
this matter before taking it up.
The gold reserve has again been
reduced to an amount barely ex
ceeding $90,000,000. Count your
gold, boys, and get ready to buy
