TEIAT CONTEST. obje
The Gazette is informed that the 11
People's ticket will contest the elec- pose
tion. Defeat is bitter to the gentle- are
men and they can not make up mu,
their minds to accept it with be- and
coming grace. They know very
well that they were fairly and V
squarely beaten, but by setting up rase
the cry of fraud they hope to lessen ,
the bitterness of defeat and make cus:
some political capital in order to cro
prevent a complete collapse of the pol
combine.
The Gazette believes that the
commissioners who conducted the Orl
last municipal election are honest Bis
men. We have neycr heard their wit
honesty questioned and we have no a
reason to believe them capable of has
practicing fraud upon anybody. Pro
Three watchers from each party wit- vie'
nessed the count and every facility Mr
was afforded the opposion to see chi
that they were not unfairly treated. tio0
What does the People's ticket wh
think*.ofd the men it selected as ter
watchers ? Does it accuse them of Lu
unfaithfulness ? Or does it simply his
infer that they did not have sense fro
enough to see what was going on ? is
The Gazette believes that the Peo- de:
ple's ticket is doing an injustice to ter
its watchers, for all three are intel- tie
ligent, clever young fellows. the
We repeat that we are satisfied hu
there is nothing in this contest, nor We
do we believe that those who are fre
claiming that fraud was committed sel
have any hope of success. dia
rSe LDemocratic victory was of
fairly and squarely won. If there Do
was fraud it was done by the other
side. tal

The Commercial Appeal wickedly pe
remarks that every time Grover al
Cleveland opens his mouth Henry so
Watterson puts his foot in it. ha
It is amusing to read the com- s5h
ments of certain newspapers upon TI
Senator McEnery's tariff views. D
They do not appear to know that hi
a Democrat is not a free-trader, nc
but they are unable to see the dif- C'
ference between Democracy and sa
protection. ht
While the recent utterances of hi
Senator McEnery may not suit the f
views of consistent Democrats, no
Louisianian' should be guilty of et
ascribing a dishonest motive to him. di
Sam McEnery has already given te
unmistakable evidences that he is bh
made of the right stuff. tt
This is how a Tennessee editor d'
wrote the obituary of a delinquent a!
subscriber: 'Crock Flood died d
last.night, owing this paper for ten fc
years' subscription. It is reported a'
that he said just before he pegged h
out that he felt like he was floating tl
upward. No doubt of it. Crock v
had got so low down that Le had to b
slide up hill to get into perdition." g
The board of assessments thatc
met at Donaldsonville last week
refused to reduce the Texas Pacific's
assessment from $6500 to $6ooo. s
An effort was made by the company a
to secure a reduction, but through r
the efforts of Mr. E. J. Harwell it
failed.
The planters, who refused to ac- I
cept rations for their negroes,
stating that they would feed theln m
as long as they would be able to do
so, have set an example worthy of I
emulation. In these days when so
many have become chronic beggars,
it is indeed edifying to see men
who have too much pride to play
the role of public mendicants.
A Republican paper is wasting
good paper and ink talking about
the dissensions existing in the ranks
of g. o. p. in Louisiana, and holds
out the olive branch of peace.
The olive branch has long lost its
potent charms among Louisiana
Republicans. The long green will
-. .do the work.
Boston thinks that it is an out
rage that the people of Augusta,
Ga., are committing by protesting
against the appointment of a ne Wa
postmaster. It makes very little temp
difference to the Southern people
what the wishes of the Hub might of Bt

d that the whip men of Augusta will Th
- draw the line on negro postmasters.
Boston can have one if it wants. Shinj
It is not likely that Augusta will Barb

st Bishop Sessums, who compares
ir with the whole set intellectually as
Lo a mountain does with a molehill,
3 has recently expressed in a sermon
profound in wisdom, ideas and
t_ views in line with modern thought. ST/
Mr. Sessums is responsible to his
te church alone for his religious ac
. tions, deeds and words, and just
et what a lot of cantankerous Presby
as terians, Methodists, Baptists and
of Lutheran preachers have to do with
his services to that church, is far
se from clear. Their recent protest TI
k is an exhibition of arrant ignorance,
o- despicable intolerance and con
to temptible intermeddling propensi
1 ties. The church, Christianity and
the worship of God is elevating to
ed humanity, without which the earth Gr
or would be a veritable hades. But

ier Hon. Robert F. Broussard, the
talented young Congressman from
ui- the third district, was on a visit to
!d. the capital on Thursday on official
business. Mr. Broussard's short
sly period of service at Washington has
ver already much improved his per
try sonal appearance, his avordupois
having increased several pounds
m-since he left his home in March.
oon The attacks made by many of the
vs. Democratic papers on account of
hat his support of the Dingley bill do
er, not appear to cause the young
lif- Congressman much worry as he
Lnd says he expected that when he cast
his vote in the way he did. He
felt that it was a duty he owed to
of his people to vote as he did, and he
the feels that whatever others may say
no regarding his course, he has the full
of endorsement of the people of his
im. district, and with this he is con
ren tent to rest his case. He does not
is blame the people of that section of
the State where sugar is not pro
:tor duced for attacking him as they do,
ent as he believes it to be the right and
ied duty of every person to stand up
ten for the interests of his own section,
ted and acting upon this theory he cast
ged his vote in favor of the bill. While
:ing the Advocate does not endorse the
ock views entertained upon this subject
i to by the brilliant young Creole Con
on." gressman, yet it admires the manli
ness with which he defends his
that course and the ability with which
eek he marshalls the argument in sup
fics port of his position. Mr. Brous- T
>oo. sard is a firm adherent and a warm
any admirer of Congressman Bailey, the
ugh minority leader in Congress, whom
I it he regards as the ablest man on the
Democratic side. The young Con
