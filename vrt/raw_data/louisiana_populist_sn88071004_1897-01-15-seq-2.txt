Judge E. T. Merrick of New
Orleans, 'an ex-Chief Justice of
. o'ir Supreme Court, a noted jurist
and a much loved citizen, died
Tuesday morning at the advanced
age of ii hty-six.
President Cleveland and Secre
tary of State Olney, have just
completed a treaty with Great
Britain, which if ratified by Con
gross, will be practically an alli
ance in support of the Monroo
doctrine, as it provides for the set
tlement by arbitration of all dif
ý; ferences between the two countries.
We give the position of our
leader to an article from the Non
conformist headed 'The Indiana
Plan," which we consider well
worthy of adoption by Louisiana
Populists. Otr exchanges show
stivity in our ranks all over the
country, and while there are a few
: laggards sitting on the fence, and
;also a few sore-heads clamoring
f-.: or party reorganization, the Peo

:energy and is stronger in growth
than any political party on the con
Next week we will give a full
__resume of the situation with plans

Tile Indiana Plan.
The conference of populists held
in this city last week was a nota
ble gathering in several particu
lars. It had some private lbusi
ness to transact, and it did it. The
city reporters were excluded from
the room and when the work was
clone, none of the hundred or more
6 present so far forgot themselves
as to give the proceedings any
° publicity, and& the reading public
is in blissful ignoranc, today of
business dlone that will be trans
mitted to the party membership
through the machinery of the par
ty. This demonstrates a strength
of organization that speaks well
for the personel of those attend
ing the conference.
But more creditable even than
this was the manner and spirit in
which they rose equal to the emer
gency and without bitterness to
ward each other on account of dif
ferences of opinion regarding com
plications of the late campaign,
they showed to enemies who want
ed our forces to waste their
strength in afamily row, that there
was no hatchet to bury and no soe
rious element of discord in our
ranks. The one or two persons
who came with a "rule or ruin"
spirit, soon found they were no
match for the brave nmen who wore
scars won in many a hard fought
battle with the enemy, anti who
were in no mood to tolerate pro
ceedings inspired by envy.
The Indiana plan is broad in
spirit, catholic in its tolerance, and
yet fully recognizes the necessity
of pushing with all vigor the or
ganization of the People's party,
free from entangling alliances and
in strict accord with the princi
ples laid down in the last recog
nized utterance of the party-the
St. Louis platform.
Briefly stated, "The Indiana
Plan" embraces, 1st: The forming
of populist clubs and perfecting
local and county organizations
wherever practicable, and, 2nd:
Where such complete organization
is impossible, it is to be the poli
cy of populists to organize any
and all kinds of clubs or orders,
or debating societies where econo
mic principles may be discussed,
to the end that populist views and
ideas may find an entrance into
neighborhooods otherwise unap
proachable.
This plan cannot be too warmly
commended, and it is hoped the
coming winter months will be ful
ly occupied in extending organi
zations along both lines as circum
stances shall decide are most de
sirable in the various localities.

Some Rambling Thoughts
BY "NEMO."
(Copyrighted.)
(These "Thoughts," by a layman, are
read in five hundred thousand homes,
scattered in every State of the Union
In this parish they will he found week
by week In the columns of this paper
only, as we have made arrangements
with the author for exclusive publica
tion.)
Allow me to continue and con
clude a necessarily brief consider- I
ation of Spain as a decaying na- I
tion. In last week's "Thoughts,"1
the assertion was practically made
that a nation must have some ideal
before it beyond thBe forcing of a
creed or the piling of wealth. In
both of these directione Spain has
been at fault. Three further ener
vating causes have been at work
undermining its national strength.
**
THE GRANDEE SPIRIT: EFr
centuries after the destruction of
the Roman Empire by the Goths
and Vandals, the human intellect
tas almnost benumbed. Until the
Renaissance and the Reformation
a pall of darkness was over all;
the nobles beint almost as un
trained as their serfs, and the serfs
being utterly crushed by those of
nobler blood. Humanity in Eu
rope lay like a giant chilled by the
cold. But since that time stimu
lation of thought has oaused the
great heart of the world to throb
with increasing power, till the life
of a common humanitv thrills, in
large moeasure, even those most
separated by birth and wealth.
moh ag:e has had its peculiar ,
chiraoteristio; ours id the "Peo- a
le's Arge But against the ten- I
tene of the people to think and t
iac hope and accomplish, the E
-l and satubborn spirit of 1
~ish Gandteerm has stood a
~th fierdeness. Yet just as ,
Ae. by.hi sword could not f
! hee it subjection nor Mrs. d
eweep backbhe waves J
borbroom. eo io dynasty or t
* ann. hq withL age and c
wl&~: ;rbe~ deeds can
hope, the cry will not (lie out but
its pleading tone will be turned
I into the fierce and fateful growl of
it cornered beast. Thus has it
been with Spain. Far more or
Sganized and dangerous than Nihi
e lism in Russia, is Anarchism in
n Spain. The Kingdom is so thor
s oughly honey-combed with the
c sentiment of a lawless breaking
sdlown of the government, that the
Y men in power try constantly to di
e vert public thought from home af
f fairs, and are glad of anything in
foreign lands that will form a safe
P outlet for the combative spirit.
SThey are under the hopeless neces
h sity of watching and guarding
I against the home population as
thoroughly as they would have to
watch an invading army. I believe
[ I am safe in saying, not even ex
0 cepting Russia, that no other na
tion in Europe but Spain is in this
anomalous condition. It stands
revealed before the world as a na
tion that has not controlled the
, growth of hope and thought, but
withstood it instead ; with the in
r evitable disaster coming nearer
C every (lay.

COLONIAL POLICY : I fear
if we look back at the conquests of
three or four centuries ago, when
constant tidings of new continents,
t wealth, etc., fired men's adventu
rous souls, the skirts of no nation
will be found entirely free from
innocent blood. With a few no
table exceptions, in spots, like
Rhode Island under Williams,
Pennsylvania under Penn, and
Maryland under Calvert, cruelty
and illiberality have almost univor
Ssally accompanied the work of es
tablishing a new colony. But
gentler times have brought gent
ler methods; and various nations
seem now to vie with each other in
the liberality and excellence of
ltheir colonial policies. Take En
gland for an instance. Its illiber
al ticatment of its most valuable
possession, now the United States,
has entirely passed away ; so that
at the present it is practically true
that many small possessions in va
rious parts are better ruled, better
prospered, and stronger as depen
dencies than they would be as sepa
Srate and independent governments.
The policy of England and of oth
er nations who try to rival her in
colonising activity, is to look only
for indirect results from good gov
ernment. Internal development is
aimed at with the confident hope
that the resulting prosperity will
react favorably to the home coun
try by reason of increasing trade,
etc. But Spain's policy has re
mained unchanged while other na
tions ha e marched onward. As
I said in last week's letter, her
colonies have always been regarded
as fair prey to he stripped of eve
rything valuable that was compact
and transportable. The fierce
greed of Cortez and PizarroF is ap
palrently unchanged. Whatever
positions of power were open for
filling, have seemed to be regarded
as the rightful heritnge of the
Spanish nobility without any re
gard asto fitness, or the benefit of
the country they ruled over. In
direct gain from the development
of a colony has never been regard
ed with such favor as the dii'ect
results by squeezing out taxes and
farming out productive positions.
This is simply another evidence of
the mad spirit of self-destruction
that has possessed Spain. The in
evitable result has been the loss
one by one since the end of last
century of the very jewels of her
diadem of empire.
AGRICULTURAL UNPROG
RESSIVENESS: About the be
ginning of the 16th century Spain,
possessed of a religious fury
very adroitly mingled with greed,
expelled the Jews and the Moors
and confiscated their property, By
so doing it inflicted as severe a na
tional injury to itself as France
did when it drove out the Huge
nots, stripping itself of its best
farmers and mechanics, tradesmen
and merchants, In 160, if my
memory serves me right, Spain
gave a further fatal blow to itself
by expelling all the Christianized
Moors. As a result up to the
present, agriculture, the necessary
basis of national prosperity, is
very undeveloped. The most pri
mative instruments are still m use
and great regions that theMoors had
made productive have fallen back
to wildness. Similar short-sight
edness characterized her abroad.
When Pizarro landed in Peru the
strip of land fifty and piore miles
iwide stretching from the ocean
front to the foot-hills of the. An
des, sunpported a prosperous popu
lation of about '00,000. The.pa
tient Perunians had made this san,
dy desert blossom like therose by
vast irrig~tion works, In some.

bf*Mere: ·Now the :deaet Is
t again triumpihant. The conquer
l ors seeking those things alone that
could lIe gained by the sword, neg
lected the real essentials of pros
perity, until now only a few thou
- sands exist where hundreds of
1 thousands were once plrospolr-os.
" The sadme lamentablo neglect was
shown in Mexico. The strange
r creatures whom Montezuma ruled
were exceedingly progressive in
their way. But their works and
plans and agricultural gains were
t scattered to the winds by their
3 blood-thirsty conquerors. Now the
spiritless Peon seems sunken.be
yond all hope of revival.
The:State of Georgia has passed,
and seemsa to be enforcing a real
anti trust law. Very good, but to
remove the cause would be better.

Mr. W. E. Shepherd, of the

Royal Germetner :
"For four long months I was
flat on my back, unable to move a
single limb of my body without as
sistance. Nothing gave mue relief.
I had given up all hopes of re
covery until the great remedy was
given me. The first week I began
to improve, and in less than thirty
ways was on my feet attending to
my duties. I am now able to work
twelve hours out of every twenty
four, and sell as many dry goods
as any man in Georgia. dl 8.
