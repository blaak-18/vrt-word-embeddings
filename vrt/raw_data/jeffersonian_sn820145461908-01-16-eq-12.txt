MR. HARDWICK’S SPEECH.
(Continued from Page Nine.)
statesmanship, has no well-defined plans
and no proper conception of the legisla
tive needs of the people.
His faculties appear to be monopolized
by a desire to shine as a parliamentarian
and debater, to earn the praise of Repub
lican newspapers and, above all, to re
ward personal friends and to punish per
sonal enemies.
Out of pure spite, he took away from
Congressman Hardwick his place on the
Census Committee—a place which he had
held for two years and in which he had
been industrious and useful.
Mr. Hardwick hasn’t been a Williams
worshipper, or blind follower, and hence
Williams’ antipathy.
Mr. Hardwick was not able to follow J.
Sharp when that gentleman joined hands
with the Republicans to emasculate the
Interstate Commerce Commission and to
protect the poor, downtrodden Pullman
Palace Car Company, the Express Com
panies, the Telegraph and Telephone
Companies from national control. For
such insubordination as this, there must
be a penalty.
Therefore, Hardwick is ousted from his
only important committee appointment
to make way for another man who, we
must assume, will vote with John Sharp,
even when that great man helps the Re
publicans uphold corporation robbery.
But it will all come right. Mr. Hard
wick will have more time for the study of
governmental questions, and for speeches
on the floor. He has already made a
good start. Let him keep it up, and the
whole country will gradually learn, what
the Jeffersonian has long known —that
Hardwick is a stronger man than John
Sharp Williams.
And—best of all —he is a true man,
and a Democrat whose democracy con
sists in principle, as well as the name.

Helvare the Impostor.
A man calling himself J. P. Vincent
has been taking subscriptions to the Jef
fersonians. He has no authority to do
so. We first heard of him as operating,
in Florida. Then he crossed into Alaba
ma. Then into Mississippi. We hope
that this second notice will have the ef
fect of causing his arrest.

Editorial Notes.
I By J. D. WATSON.
In his address to the Jacksonian Club
of Nebraska at Omaha, Mr. Bryan said:
"No question is ever settled until the
moral element in the question is discussed
and decided; nothing but a moral issue,
that is an issue involving justice, stirs
the heart. Andrew Jackson addressed
himself to the moral nature and aroused
a moral enthusiasm that outlived his pe
riod. The time is ripe for another appeal
to conscience and indications point to a
greater study of public questions from an
ethical standpoint. The corrupting influ
ences which have flowed from mercenary
politics have at last excited attention, and
there is a searching of men and of meas
ures such as has not been known in re
cent times.
“The President’s popularity is largely,
if not entirely, due to the belief among
the masses that he wants to do what is
right and he is trying to secure justice
to those who have been unjustly dealt
with. He has made many mistakes and
great ones, but these mistakes have to a
large extent been overlooked by those
who believe his heart is right and that he
means well. This is only an indication
of public attitude.
“Party Lines Hang Loosely.
“Another indication is to be found in
the influence of the voters. Not since
the war have party lines hung so loose
ly, and this is the natural result when
the voters become earnest in their desire
that wrong shall be overthrown and right
vindicated.
“People differ as to the relative im
portance of the different issues, some
placing trusts first, some regarding the
tariff question as paramount, and others
believing the railroad question most im
portant. But the fact is, they all point
to the same issue and that those who take
the people’s side on one of these ques
tions are likely to take the people’s side
on either of the other two. The issue
presented in each and all of these ques
tions is whether the government shall be
administered in the interest of a few fa
vorites or in the interest of the whole
people —whether all the people shall be
taxed that a few may be enriched.”
We will have to agree with Mr. Bryan
on this summing up of the situation.
The people are thinking for themselves
more than they have in years.
They are considering principles and
men who represent principles instead of
mere party names, and the man who is
a candidate on the people’s side of these
issues will receive thousands of votes that
have heretofore been cast as the party
bosses directed.
AND THAT MAN IS THE MAN
WHO WILL BE ELECTED IN 1908.
The Republicans have about agreed up-
on a currency measure to be passed at
this session of Congress.
It is what is known as the Aldrich bill
and provides for the issue of emergency
currency to the amount of $250,000,000,
if necessary and subject to a tax
running as high as 6 per cent, to
provide for its retirement when the
emergency is ended. This curren
cy will be in the same form and
character as the present national bank
notes and will be secured by approved
state, county and municipal bonds and
by first mortgage railroad bonds.
In other words, it will be a fund for the
benefit of the moneyed few and not for
the benefit of the country.
When another panic comes the money
kings can have the use of $250,000,000 at
one-half of one per cent per month and
charge the people whatever rate of inter
est they wish to for the use of it.
It is another scheme to make the mon
ey king richer at the expense of the coun
try.

Many ask why a bond is considered
such gilt edged security that it should
be accepted in preference to any other
security. The truth is that it is NOT bet
ter security.
There are other securities just as good
as any bond, and much better than most
bonds.
But the trouble does not come about be
cause of the security. The reason that
bonds are always made gilt edged secur
ity is because that most of the bonds are
owned by Wall street or Wall street in
terests and these interests do not want
the security so that anyone else can get
the money.
If a warehouse receipt or land were to
be accepted as security by the govern
ment the farmer could borrow as well
as the Wall street banker, and that is ex
actly what the banker is determined that
he shall not dp.
If the farmer could get his money as
the Wall street banker gets his, it would
put a stop to Wall street’s robbing the
South and West, and that is just what
Wall street is determined shall not be
done.
State bonds are good security., Yes,
they have the wealth of the state to back
the bond. So with the county bond, but
it may not be quite as good as the state
bond.
But the municipal bond is sometimes
very risky security. The temptation to
bond a municipality is greater, and they
sometimes bond themselves into bank
ruptcy.
But to accept railroad bonds as secur
ity in preference to many other securities
is the limit.
The Aldrich bill had just as well add
and “approved one or two-thirds water”
for that is just what most railroad bonds
are.
