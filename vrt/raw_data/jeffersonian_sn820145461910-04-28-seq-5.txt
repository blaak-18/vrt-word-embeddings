THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE
AND A FEW LACONICS
By L. A. L.
THE BAD MANNERS OF AMERI
CANS.
Several weeks ago the press all
over the country teemed with adverse
criticism, made by a well-known
writer, of the manners of a certain
Northern city’s people.
The people criticised waxed wroth,
and the writer-critic was berated on
all sides for his statements.
As a people we have long been
held up by Europeans (whom our
new-rich try so hard to ape) as the
most vulgar and most unmannered
people on earth.
And recent happenings would in
dicate that we deserve nearly all said
of us.
We are vulgar, and we are bad
mannered. Vulgar—as to the dis
play of wealth, and the exploitation
of those who have nothing—abso
lutely nothing but mere money to
recommend them.
Bad mannered —in that we are in
tolerant of the opinion of others
when it conflicts with our own.
Let a body of American men or
women be gathered—socially, infor
mally—in any of the cities and the
trend of conversation in each indi
vidual group will be towards money.
The worth of So and So; the price
of such a one’s new car, or house, or
yacht. The value of the jewels of
such another one; the amount of
money made on the last deal. The
value of the real estate, whose pos
session seems only to indicate more
money.
In a train recently a conversation
between two men and a woman,
overheard by everyone in the car,
ranged over every possible topic, but
always with the money value tagged
on somewhere. Discussion as to the
change between eastern and south
ern time brought on discussion —
and the price—of the watches of the
party. Evidently, they were tourists
en route North. Had one been to
So and So’s new place? And the
price So and So paid for the place,
for the autos used to get there, and
the upkeep, were thrashed out.
Did one know Judge ? Yes
enormously wealthy, etc.
Had one met Mrs. the past
winter? '

Malsby, Shipp & Company, T Atlanta, Ga.
Indeed, yes; lovely woman, most
expensive dresses and jewelry of any
one at the hotel.
Played golf any?
Yes, indeed; golf links cost umpty
ump dollars to lay out.
Like the hotel?
Oh, yes; awfully expensive, but
everything there was the best money
could buy.
And so it went on for four solid
mortar hours. The three had the
dollar mark all over them; they
didn’t realize the bad taste nor the
bad manners of their mode, and it’s
doubtful if they would have altered
any, even had they known.
Our civic and social bodies, who
are supposed to be more or less in
public life, are not lessening our
reputation for bad manners.
The action of the women in Wash
ington, who publicly hissed the Presi
dent of the nation, has done more to
turn public sentiment against suf
frage than anything that has hap
pened.
Our theater-goers are using the
questionable method of hissing those
entertainers whose talent doesn’t
amuse. Even our children, especial
ly those of the larger cities, are be
coming boorish and abrupt; there
seems to be a lack of the innate re
finement which should make consid
eration of others a natural sequence.
Who is to blame?
The mothers, largely.
In their frantic efforts to run as
much of the universe as they can
possibly control, the women of the
United States are, in a very large
degree, ignoring and neglecting the
womanly virtue of “training the child
in the way he should go.” We may
dodge behind and around and over
this argument as nimbly as our wit
will permit, but it remains a sact —to
the mothers of the United States be
longs the moulding of public manners
and morals.
Ballots, franchise covering every
thing from dog tax to police appoint
ments and all the “demands” of the
suffragettes will never accomplish
one-third as much good as the efforts
of the mothers to inculcate “gentle
manners and the art of being agree
able” to the children of today.

We have prated long and wisely of
our womens’ ability to accomplish all
they determine to do.
If we will now look for the practi
cal results, which can only be accom
plished through the medium of nor
mal, sane and healthy family home
life, we will realize the uselessness
of theoretical ranting, and the REAL
value and scope of woman’s influence.

Bryan has arrived, Roosevelt is on

broad view. Poor old U. S.!

Probably it got choked to death on

If Taft doesn’t really mean to
“announce” for a second term, his
press agent is sinfully wasteful of
newspaper “dope.”
Percy, of Mississippi, likes the sam

he’s willing to try for the whole
package, so he says.

“Hearst not in Bryan’s class,” says

Some one has written an article on
“The Progressive Democrat.” He
seems to have progressed straight out

Newspaper item tells “where most
lobsters are.” That’s easy; around
the stage doors in winter time, and
the summer hotels in summer time.
Newspaper headline reads, “Wage
Earner Who Became a Wife.” That’s
nothing, the wives who have turned
into wage earners take all the counts.

And all those high born D. A. R.

Horrible case of cruelty reported

A burglar, who was serving a sen

Young James Garfield seems well

We’ve heard of the person who

“Whiskey from grain only,” de

Some of the Southern courts will

Begins to look as though the Scien
