chiefly on Laura's account. The
jourt would soon sit to try her case,

'"^•^(eal of ready money would be nee

Unit^rsity biH wfs sure to pass,
this timfoj aud that would make
moiieyfidelity, but might not the
help eoin^ta i^la te ? Congress had
only^just» a^jphbled, aud deltas
were to be'foSpçfl 1 ^ -
" Well," said ' tfiiWolonel, " I
don't know but you arjpTh^eor less
right, there. Now let's figure up a
little on the preliminaries. I ttihUv
Congress always tries todo Us ilctvç,

«TijUuân
right as it can, according to its
lights. A man can't ask any lairer
than that. The first preliminary it
al^ja^r'start&ljMjt . oh^ is to clean
"**" itself so to spea^: * It will arraign
two or three dozen ol its members,
or nia;i|pfour or live dozeu, tor tak
ing hrih^EN tty-y ofce for this and that
'*aud the othernm l^Ovinler.''
'».It got« up intoTlïtr dozens,
, 3 docs it F
" Well, yes ; in a free country
like ours, where any man can fun
for Cou gross and anybody can vote
for him, you can't expect immortal
purity all the time—it ain't in na
ture. Sixty or eigtfty or a hundred
and fifty people are bound to get
in who are not angels in disguise,
as young iricks the correspondent
says: but still it is a very good
average; very good indeed. As
long as it averages as well as that,
Ï think we can feel very well satis
fied. Even in theso days, when
peoplo growl so much and the
newspapers are so out of patience,
there is still a very respectable mi
nority ot honest inen in Congress."
" Why a respectable minority of
honest nicu can't do any good, C%1
oncl. 1 '' ®
: ".Oh, yes it can, too."
" Why, how ?"
$ " < M i, mi many ways, manv®ways."
. " But whiit arc the ways J"
" Weli—I don't know—it is si
question that requires time ; a body
can't answer every question right
off-hand. But it docs. do good. ]
am satisfied of that." ®
"All right, then ; grant that it
does good; goon with the prelimi
naries."
"That is what I am coming to.
First, as I said,' they Will try a lot
ot members for taking money for
votes. That will take lour weeks."
" Yes, that's like last year ; and
®ifc is a sheer waste of thô time for
which the nation pays those men to
work —that is what* that is. And it
pinches when a body's git a bill
waiting."
"A waste of time, to purify the
fountain of public law ? Well, I
never heard anybody express an
idea like that before. But if it
were, it would still be the f$nlt of
the minority, for the majority don't
institute the^e proceedings. There
js where thatämiuority becomes an
obstruction—but still one can't say
it is on the wrong side. Well, after
they have finished the bribery
cases, they wdltako up cases of
members who have bought .their
seats with money. Tlnyt w ill take
another. fo«r weeks."
" @ Vcry good; go-on. Yon have
accounted for two-thirds df the ses
sion."
" Next tlioy will try eacl® other
for various smaller irregularities,
® like the gale ot appointments to
AVst Point cadetships, and that
sort of thing—mere trilling pocket
-money enterprises that might bet
ter be passed over in.silence, per
haps, but then one of our Congress
es can never®rest easy till it has
thoroughly purified itself of all
blemishes—and that ^i § thing to
be applauded."
" How long docs it take to disin
fect itself of these minor impuri
ties ?" ®
® 4 Well, abogt two weeks, gene
rally." ®
"So Congress always lies help
less in quarantine ten weeks of a
sessiou. That's encouraging. Col
onel, pbor Laura will never get any
benefit from ' our® bill. Her trial
will be over before Congress has
half purilied itself. And doesn't it
occur to y (Mithat l»y the time it has
expelled all its impure members
there may not be enough members
left to do business legally ?"
o " Why did e iiot say Congress
would expel anybody."
" Well icon't it expel anybody ?"
" Not necessarily. Hid . it last
, year ? It never does. That would
iiot be regular."
" Then why waste all the sessions
in that tomfoolery of trying mem

"Oh, no. The country thinks
somebody is going to be expelled."
'* Well, when nobody it expelled,
what does the country think then ?"
"By that time, the thing «has
strung out so long that (he conn try
is sick and tired of it and glad to
have a change on any terras, But
all that inquiry is not löst. It has
a good moral effect." ©
M Who does it have a good moral
effect on F
" Well—I ©don't know. On for
eign countries, I think. We have
always been under the gaze of for
eign countries. There is no coun
try in the world, sir, that pursue»
corruption as inVeterate'ly as we do.
.There is no country in the world
whose representatives try each other
as much as ours do, or stick to.it
as long on a stretch. I think there
is something great fn being a model
tor the whole civilized .world, Wash
ington." ■ •
" You don't moan a model ; you
mean an example." * ®
"Well it's all the same; it's just
the same thing. It shows. that a
«TijUuân can't be corrupt Tii this coun try
whîtiout sweating for it, I
can tell
you that."
" Hang it, Colonel, you just said
We never punish anybody for vil
lainous practices."
" But good God. wo try them,
don't we ! Is it nothing to show a
disposition to sift things and bring
people to a strict account? I tell
you it has its effect."
" Oh, bother the effect !—What is
it they do do ? Ilow do they pro
eeed? You know perfectly well—
and it is all bosh, too. Come, now,
how do they proceed ?"
" Why they proceed right and
regular—and it ain't bosh, Wash
ington, i^ain't bosh. They appoint
a committee to investigate, aud that
committee hears evidence three
weeks, and all the witnesses on on<
side swear that the accused took
money or stock or®something tor
his vote. Then the accused stands
up and testifies that he may have
don? it, but he was „receiving and
handling a good deal of money at
the time and he doesn't reigember
this particular circumstance—at
least with sufficient distinctness to
to enable him to grasp it tangibly.
So of course the thing is not proven
and that is what they cay in®thc
verdict. They don't acquit, they
don't condemn. They just say,
'Charge not proven.' It leaves the
accused in a kind of a shaky condi
tion before the country, it purities
Congress, it satisfies everybody,
and it .doesn't seriously hurt any
body. It has taken a long time to
perfect our system, but it is "the
most admiration in the world, now."
. ° il So one ot those long stupid in
vestigation always turns out*?n
that lame silly way
correct. 1 »thought naybe you
viewed the matter ditterently from
other people. Do ^ou think a Con
gress of ours could convict the dev
il of anything it he were a mem
ber?*
" ]\I.^ dear boy, don't let these
damaging delays prejudice you
against Congress. Don't use such
strong language ; you talk like a
newspaper. Congress has inflicted
frightftil punishments on its mem
bers—now you know that. When
they tried Mr. Fairoaks, and a
Woud of witnesses proved him to be
—well, you know what they proved
liini to be—an'd his own testimony
and his own confessions gave him
"the same character, what <alid Con
gress do then ?—come !"
" Well, what did Congress do?"
"You know what Congress ||lid,
Washington. Congress intimated
plainly enough, that they consider
ed him almost a staiu upon their
bodyj and without waiting ten
days, hardly, to think the thing
over, they |rose up and hurled at
him a resolution declaring"! hat they
disapproved of his conduct! Now
you know that Washington."
"It teas a terrific thing—there is
no denying that, ®If he had®bcen
proven guilty of theft, arson, iieen
yousness, infanticide, and defiling
graves, 1 believe they would Jpve
suspended him for two days."
" You cau depend on it, Wash
ington. Congress is vindictive,
Congress is savage, sir, when it
jgets waked up once. It will go to
any length to uiudicate its honor
at such a time."

IIoolc and Twaddle.—At a certain
printing odice, where a®work of the
celebrated humorist Theodore IIoolc
was being printed, there was an oliV
compositor who went by the nickname
of " Twaddle." Incompleting a sheet
of one ol Mr. Hook's novels, the cop#
was given out in small " takes" or
portions, to each one of which the
compositor's name was as usual ap
peiided. When the proof was sent to
the author, there appeared a line
drawn down the margin of a certain
page with the word "Twaddle" at®the
side. Mr. lfook received his proof,
read it, and brought it back to the
oflico with the remark that " though lie
was not above criticism, he did not
think the ' reader' was quite the man
to make it."
Tb« man most looked '
tbo fflooa
to—The man in
m
Peck'« with a
Coal Stove.
We never had a coal stove around
the house until last Saturday.
Have always burned pine slabs and
pieces of our neighbor's fenee. They
burn well, too, but the fence go*all
burned up, and the neighbor said
ho wouldn't build a new one, so we
went down to Jones''and got a coal
stove. It is called the. "Radiant
Home," and any man that says we
didn't have radiant home at our
house for about four hours'last Sat
urday night is a Republican and a
villian. You see we didn't know
anything about -coal stoves. We
filled thö Radiant Home about'half
full of pine fence, and when the
stuff got well to going we filled the
artisan well with coal. "It simmered
and sputtered about lor five or ten
minutes and all ' w"eut out, and we
put on nû overcoat and a pair of
buckskin mittens ami ' J went out
too," ro slipper.. We remarked, in
the course of thft frugal meal, that
Jones was a " froad" for recom
mending such a confounded refri
gerator to ft man to get wafkn by.
After supper we took a piece of ice
and rubbed our hands warm, and
went in where that .stove was, re
solved to make.her .draw and burn
it it took all the pine fence in. the
First Ward. Our better half threw
a quilt over her and shïveri ugly re
marked that she never knew what
real solid comfort was until she got
, , ,
a coal Stove, h tun g by tllO srtrcasm .
in her remark, we turned everyl
dingus in the stove that was mov-1
able, or looked like it had anything'
to do with a draft, and pretty soon
the Hadiaut Home began to •heave
ni» beat. It was not long before
slip stutterred like the new Silsby
steamer. Talk about ytgir heat !
In ten minutes that room w-as as
much worse than a Turkish bath as
Hades is hotter than Liverman's
ice-house. The perspiration fairl t y%
fried out of a tin water-cooler in
the next room. We then openedjthe
doors,-and the snow beçan to melt
as far up Vine street as Hansconilj's
house, and peoplo all round the
neighborhood put on linen cMhes.
And we couldn't stop the confound
ed thing. Wo forgot what Jones
told us about the dampers, and she
just kept, a biling. The only thing
we could do was to go to bed, and
leave t'.ie thing to burn the house
if it wanted to. We stood off with
a pole, and turned the damper every
way, and every turn she just sent
out lieat enough to roast an ox.
We went to bed, Supposing that the
coal would eventually burn out, but
about twelve o'clock the whole
family had to get up afld sit on the
fence. Finally a man came along
who had been brought®np ai@ong
coal stoves, and he put a wet blank
et over him and crept up to tl^e
stove and turned the proper dingus,
and she cooled oil", and since that
time has been just as comfortable
as possible. If you buy a coal
stove you ^vant to learn how to
engineer it, or you may get roast
ed.—■[" La Crosse Democrat. ''

DECISION OP THE POPE.
The ST. LOUIS GLOBE of the 10th
ult., makes thé following impor
tant announcement: '
Roman'Catholic farmer« deqli^na qf
joining the ordéi| of the patrobf of
husbandry, have hitherto had In Àielr
way the laws'of their church, forbid
ding its members to identify, tbeni«
selves with secret societies. Of Mt
American prelate» wo believe that
Archbishop Alemanry, of 'Ban Ptan
cisch, has held that tné' Catholic fhr
nier will do Well to ere OM the Aide of
safety, and so not join the grange, un
til the Pope lifts evpressed bis Approv
al of its objects, while other Bishop»
have forbidden members of their flock»
from becoming patrous-upon any coflf
sideration. ! ' ' , * r
The matter has been flnAjJy .adj'n.lL
cated on by Piuns IX, as nppear« by
the Novisk Volkeblad, the ^eaudiuari
an organ of Minnesota.
A Catholic member of the StatnLeg
islatnrn was desirous of joining tho
grange, but had eoftseWAttöa» sçmpl^s
about doing so, arising fl-orti hls rejj
gioiis belief. ! '
He consulted.Fathcft Ireland, of St.
Paul, who referred him to Bishop
Grace. Both these clergymen { ex
pressed themselves as possessing a fa
vorable impression of thé principles,
objects and methods ot the grange, but
neither of them could break though the
absolute rule of the church, arid they
recommended the legislator to appeal
to Rome.
lie accordingly laid the matter be
fore the Pope, to whom be transmitted
at the same time full particulars as to
the objects contemplated by the order,
and the means by which it was pro
posed to nttain them.
A reply has been received from his
Holiness, stating that the Pope allows
the petition to joiu the Orauge of
Patrons of Husbandry, and ho a mem
ber thereof, if he find nothing therein
conflict with his conscience, or the
creed of the Catholic Church.
As a congregation, the order has
received a large accession in Minneso
ta, and when tho news of the Pope's
decision has reached other States, its
effects will be largely to increaso tho
numbers of the patrons, and to removo
the interdict laid npon Catholics dé
sirions of becoming such, by prelates,
who have disapproved of the Grange,
and been doubtful as tho consistency
of its obligations with those of the
Church.
