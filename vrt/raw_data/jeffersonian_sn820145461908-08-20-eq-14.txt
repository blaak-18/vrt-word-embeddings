SITY
lias the following to say of Locust Grove In
stitute: ‘‘Locust Grove Institute stands in
the front rank among the preparatory schools
of Georgia. Its success in training young
men has been phenomenal. Parents entrust
ing their children to its care will not be dis
appointed.” Note —28 pupils from L. G. I.
were in Mercer last year; 21 this year. Every
member of this year’s graduating class, num
bering 17, expects to attend college. Before
deciding upon a school to patronize, write for
information to Claude Gray, President, Lo
cust Grove, Ga.
Tom Watson should certainly be strong with
I lie farmers; he is the parent of the rural free
delivery of mail system which is educating the
farmers to up-to-date ways and giving the
country the mail facilities of the city. —Cordele
Rambler.
Mr. Bryan and his party have had much to
say about accepting campaign funds from
corporations, but within the past" few days
Mr. Bryan has accepted SI,OOO from two phon
orgraph trusts to help raise campaign funds
for his party. —Caucasian, July 23.
If Mr. Bryan has any dull moments during
the campaign, he can put them to good use by
guessing where Tom Watson will hit him
next. —Washington Post.
