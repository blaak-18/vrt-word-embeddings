The Pilette Entertainment.
To The Lafayette Gazette.
Prof. Meaux's I)ramatic Club
played to a very good house at the
Pilette Hall last Saturday. . It was
a social' as well as a financial suc
cess. We understand that the pro
ceeds thereof as well as those of
other plays are for the benefit of the
Pilette public school. The pro
fessor and patrons of his school are
hard at work to enlarge their school
house, which is entirely too small for
the large attendance of pupils from
that section. Prof. Greig has suc
ceeded in putting an annex to his
school. Prof. Meaux is undertak
inn the same thing, and it is to be
hoped that others will follow in the
good work. The directors of each
ward should encourage their
teachers in this noble work, by
visiting the parents in their respec
wards and preaching to them the
necessity of education. It is only
by concert of action by patrons, di
rectors and teachers that any thing
of that kind can be carried on suc
cessfully. The School Board
might put in their share of work,
by offering an advance of salary, as
a means of encouragement to
teachers who would work up their
schools to such proportions; be
cause the teacher who teaches only
an average of say a5 to o20, min my
judgment, has not the credit that
the one who teaches an average of
35 or 45 has; and besides this offer
might be the means of inducing
teachers to working up their school
continually, and I have no doubt
that our schools would be .more
progressive generally than they
actually are. Yours truly, B. S.

CARENCRO NEWS.
The Gazette Correspondent's
Weekly Resume of Items of
Interest in and About
Carencro.
--Why should the planters go to
Carencro to dispose of crops ? Be
cause it is known to be the best
market in the parish. And why so ?
Because there is no difficulty in
getting the top-market price for all
products, especially cotton, sugar
cane, and corn. There is active
competition, and where such ex
ists, fair-dealing is sure to be found.
The following buyers are in the
field for the coming year.
SUGAR-CANE BUYERS.
Carencro Sugar Company.
Ferris Sugar Company.
Teche Sugar Company.
Besides others that may have
their representatives stationed here.
COTTON BUYERS.
A. Crouchet and A. Guidry, I
agents for J. Meyers & Company.
M. Delpit, agent for Roos &
Company.
O. P. Guilbeau for W. H. Kline
& Company.
L. G. Stelly.
COTTON SEED ACENTS.
A. C. Guilbeau, Union Oil Com
pany.
L. Deleglise, St. Martins Oil C
Company.
Dr. F. W. Courtney, Standard
Oil Company.
A. C. Prejean, Opelousas Oil
Company.
G. L. Singleton, Independent I
Oil Company.
CORN BUYERS.
A. Cheffer, and others.
The system that prevails at Ca- r
rencro provides for quick forward
ing of all shipment. Furthermore,
within stone-throw of the station
are two large gins whose capacity n
is about forty-five bales per day. 1i
Also a sugar house with a. daily
capacity of 200 tons of cane.
-Father Laforest is expected
home about the 28th of this month.
-Mr. and Mrs. John T. Block,
of New Orleans, returned home
last Friday after spending a couple
of days, with the family of D. A.
I)imitry.
-Brother Cherokee is perfectly
right in publishing the advantages
and possesions of the progressive s
town or Royville; but must remem- t
ber that Carencro, which also holds
forth in southwest Louisiana, boasts
of having 9 general merchandise
stores, x fancy notions store, 3
physicians, t drug store, 5 black- d
s:nit'i andwheelwrig .t shops, 2 oys- t
ter saloons, a baker shops, 2 large n
gins, 2 corn mills, 3 fruit stores, I
x first-class lumber yard, 3 eating
houses, I coal yard, 6 saloons, a
public school with an average at- s
tendance of zoo pupils, requiring
the attention of two teachers, a well fl
conducted private day and night
school, a sugar mill with a daily I
capacity of two hundred tons, and
telephone. telegraph and railroad a
communication with everywhere.
As for intelligent and lovely girls
girls Carencro can't be beat, at any c
point of the compass. Sorry, Bro. a
Cherokee, but we can't help it.
-\Ve are pleased to welcome
home Mr. C. A. Lobdell, who has
returned from a visit to friends and
relatives at Bayou Goula, La. b
-Mr. M. Delpit has made Caren
cro his headquarters for the busi- h
ness season.
-There are several places where b
the cane was slightly damaged by
the high wind, some days ago. e
-The sugar planters meeting a
failed to materialize on the i5th.
-The Opelousas Oil Company
and Compress are making active b
bids for the cotton seed and cotton
of Carencro.
-Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus Guidry 6
went to Breaux Bridge last Satur
day. *
-M-rs, D. Micaud is well again, t(
after quite a long spell of sickness. l1
-Mr. J. Blum was a visitor in h
Opelousas last Sunday.
-A few of our sugar planters are
advertising the fact, that they were n
Democrats for revenue only. Their
flip flop may wind up by giving "us
free sugar next December, then the
real sugar or cane producer will be u
in a bad fix "sure enough."
-WVe hear it said the recent rains
have injured the cotton crop here- s
abouts, but to what extent cannot a
be learned. h
-Rev. Father Girard, S. J., of
Grand Coteau, officiated at Highsl
Mass last Monday. r
-Mr. Leon I,emaire, of New re
Iberia, was the guest of Mr. A. C. I>
Guilbeau last Sunday.
-We had the pleasure of greet
ing Hon. A. I. (;uilbeau in townn
this week. s.

Bayou Carencro last Saturday:
Coroner Gladu- was notified and
held the inquest. -
-Cards are out for the marriage
of Miss Corinne Boudreau and Mr.
J. Aristide Dugal, which will take
place at the "Church of the Sitcred
Heart," Grand Coteau, La., on the

is the charming and talented daugh
ter of Mr. Edgar Boudreau, a lead,
ing merchant of Sunset, La. Mr.
Dugal is assistant agent of the
So. Pac. Company at Carencro, I
is very popular, and has made many
warm and earnest friends since his
residence in our town. We extend
our congratulations.
-Scott and Grand Coteau base
ball clubs tried conclusions on the
Carencro diamond last Sunday.
The score stood 20 to I5 in favor
of the Scott team. It was a very 1
interesting game.
-Master Amick Courtney accom
panied by his father, Dr. F. 1V.
Courtney and Prof. Barrett, left for
Crowley last Monday, where Master
Amick will enter the Crowley Col
lege for the coming session.
-Chalk down the usual Demo
cratic majority given in this State, i
and under it write down the num
ber of sugar men, that seem deter- a
mined on advertising themselves;
deduct one from the other; and s
any true Democrat can afford to r
keep perfectly cool, when he sees (
the result. TOTIDEM VERBIS.

Happenings in the Busy and
Thrifty Town - Reported 1
for the Columns of The c
Gazette.
--The late heavy and continued a
rains have disastrously injured the
cotton, causing the bolls to rot on g
opening. It is said fully one sixth v
of the crop will thus be lost. With ,
middling at so low a price, the out
look is not very encouraging. ti
-P. B- Roy, Esq., returned s'
from New Orleans Thursday. b
-Dr. Young and daughters, s
Misses Maud and Beulah, left for
Clinton, La., Monday. r
-Miss Delanoe, of Vermilion s
parish, was visiting Dr. Scranton's C
family this week. C
-M-'essrs. J. Alciatore and R.
Roy, were at Lafayette Sunday. P
-Some fair and lovely Lake
Simonet damsels, have captivated s
the good intentions of two young
Royvillians.
-The town council met last week, J
the first time since when ?
-Mr. Giles Bonnemaison, ab
daring young navigator, lately re- 1
turned from Chenire-aa-la-croix, ti
much improved in health and good t
looks.
-Messrs Andreand Paul Billaud, a
of Broussard, passed through town S
Sunday, en route to Peigneur Lake.
-It is to be hoped that a hand- u
ful of autocratic sugar magnates, ,,
will not succeed in quenching the n
Democratic spirit of this State. t<
-Born to Mrs. Ambroise Mallet, "
a baby girl, mnother and child i<
doing well.
A wedding, with charivari ac- b
companiment, was one of the many
attractions the past week. o
-Fitz, the celebrated mayor of
New Orleans, should surely have a y
series of chronic -'fits," if fortunate
enough to escape the many charges
booked against him.
-Little Miss Gertrude Scranton,
has been confined to her little cot
lately, feeling the ill effects of some
baby ailment.
-Mr. Charles Young, one of our -
esteemed young men, has accepted
a situation from Mr. Rosenthal, of
New Iberia. Charlie is deservedly
popular, and numbers his friends
by the score. Good luck to you,
old man.
-Modeste, Sam, Lady, Gabe, all
fast horses claiming supremacy over ,
each other. The best test as to the ti
fastest, would be to run the four
together, for a square meal and aP
half a dollar purse. The best a
horse must win there. tr
-It was very unfortunate that
Mr. Mlagner, or his driver, did not a
notice that, "that" mud hole near
town had but recently been filled.
The heavy rains of a few days ago
washed and softened the dirt, nat
urally causing the mud hole to be
come somewhat boggy. We are
very sorry that the gentleman was
so unceremoniously seated in such
a soft mass, but it remains to beS
hoped that his return trip to this
village will be made with better re
sults. A word or two about the Y
roads, if such is allowed your co:- tl
respondent: It is freely admitttd
by all, that the public roads between tI
Lafayette and RIoyville are not, as
the traveling publIic would like to
see them; to that, we acquiesce.t
with lflcwsuirs. But what ka.
soinded to us very "peculiar" is:
I Why such an uncalled for accusa
tion of "criminal negligence" of
that bog-hole atone, when we have
seen nmud-holes in the roads between
both towns tens tinmes worse than the
l one in question? Is it prejudice
against Rlyville, or what is it?
r Last fall and winter, the- roads. were
simply impassable, ornamented with
bottomless pits and precipices; and
sti-ll, no report came that anyone
had been transformed into a "hete
rogenous mass"! Royville is cer
tainly in hard luck, as "only one
mud-hole" has caused so many re
gretted comments and remarks
Again, why so "much ado about
little" is what the good people of
this town are now wandering at.

YOUNGSVILLE P. O., La.. Sept. 17, '94,
To the Lafayette Gazettes
It surely looks a little bit funny to us:
there is one of two things; either The Ad
vertiser is born of an extraordinary good and
happy disposition, or else of a conveniently
short memory to say the least. Simply ga
ing back a short time past-hardly a century
ago-it proclaimed, maintained, suggested,
even advocated the "'Sunshine Theory"
as being plenty good, if not more than suf
ficient for the good of the public safety. And
of course, all of us, I do belive, without a
sinple exception, being strictly of the law
abiding kind, and born of th-- "old school"
natural philosophers, readily took the hint
(not a straw interfering with the scales as
far as indifference is concerned)and are now
simgly tired to put the well-weighed, and=
by all, fully approved of suggestion, to
practical use-that is the whole substance
in a nut shell. That we deeply sympathize
with Mr. Ma.l: .-; .. iut saying. But
still more w: - ierf ui Ia:n :'1 to us, is that
The Advertiser .oh." 2 .J ssuJdenly take ex
ception, and be the first to kick about the
Royville roads! Boldly exposing us to the
critical eyes of the world. Such things we
deprecate sorely; because they are sad and
should be profoundly regretted by an In
telligent community. Indeed, unless we are
greatly in error no one here has complained
very bitterly as regards the matter above
mentioned, and why Ishould others? Allow
us sufficient time at least to test the theory.
The matter is now under consideration and
we are making personal experiments fromn
time to time. So far as that goes we will
sooner or later report upon the subject
whether or not it should still be continued,
being very inexpensive to the parish, or
given up as.a flat footed failure. CITIZEN.
