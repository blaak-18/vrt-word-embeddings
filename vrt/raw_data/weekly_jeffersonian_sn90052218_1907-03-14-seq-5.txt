A Satisfied Subscriber.
Hon. Thomas E/Watson:
I am in possession of your magazine.
It is the most readable, and educating
that I have perused. It is multum in
parvo. I am a continual subscriber,
because there is no other magazine
like it. With highest regards.

Bailey ! s "Ole Hoss."
Editor Weekly Jeffersonian:
Out here most of us feel that Texas
is now carrying Joe Bailey as “ole
hoss” freight. When another clear
ance day comes he will go down and
out. He has a name to live, but really
he is a dead ’un! E. WHITE.

Some Unsettled Questions.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson:
I am only a traveling man, but I
would like to ask you or some author
ity among your readers, a few ques
tions that perplex me.
Ist. Has the Southern Railway Com
pany a license from the federal gov
ernment to do business in Georgia?
2d. If not, how can it do business in
Georgia without the consent of the
state?
3. How can the state allow it to do
business as a corporation, unless it
gets a charter from the state as state
corporations must do?
4th. If it has no state charter can
not the state refuse it the right to do
business In and upon its territory?
Who will kindly answer me, and
other independent citizens,
these questions in the order that I
have asked them?

That "Yellowed” Peach.
Dear Mr. Watson:
Your editorial on Depew, “the
Peach," was a gee-whizzer. The
American senate has a pretty staunch
or greatly depraved stomach to stand
the presence and the impudent hypoc
risy of that political yegg-man of the
Vanderbilts and their allies. Depew
is Oily Gammon, Uriah Heap «and
Jeremy Diddler —a three-ply proxy of
the Hearst-labeled “plunderbund."
Wouldn’t you hate to be a New York
er while Depew and Platt represent
the State? I would. Yours with best
wishes. JAMES MITCHELL.

Some History for Georgians.
Editors Weekly Jeffersonian:
This day, March 4, has more his
toric value to us Georgians than even
the usual blessing of the adjourn
ment of congress—yea, of a billion dol
lar congress. Maybe I am something
of a date flend, but history and biogra
phy are among the most delightful and
helpful of my literary recreations in
my declining years.
March 4, 1748, Count Casimir Pu
laski was born in Podolia, Poland. His
father was a Polish patriot who form
ed the confederation of 1768 and in
that young Casimir got his “baptism
of blood" fighting against the Russian
Al ***'
ZETTEKJ FROM THE PEOPLE
invaders of his motherland. He won
great distinction as a warrior, but in
1772 he was exiled and came to Ameri
ca. When the Revolution came on he
raised a legion of horsemen in Penn
sylvania and joined the patriot army.
The Moravian women of Bethlehem
embroidered a banner for him, and
when, after many bloody encounters,
he was wounded mortally at Savan
nah, the banner was used as his wind
ing sheet when he was buried. Long
fellow Immortalized the episode in one
of his stirring lyrics. There is a mon
ument to Pulaski in Savannah, and
one of our noblest counties is named
in his honor.
Also, it was on March 4, 1883, that
Georgia’s “great commoner," Alexan
der Hamilton Stephens, died in guber
natorial harness in Atlanta. Our great
state had no more unselfish
and seer-llke patriot. We cannot too
impresively teach our children the
record of the life of one so conse
crated to the love of state and coun
try.

data may consume. Your client in

They Did and We Do!
Editors Weekly Jeffersonian:
Before they knocked off work, did
our self-sacrificing congressmen pre
serve to themselves the inalienable
right to send out “gold brick" garden
seeds, and do we still remain heirs to
the inestimable boon of getting “them
seed"? JOHN M. SMYTHE.

There’s No Such Authority.
Editors Weekly Jeffersonian:
Is any authority given by the federal
constitution to congress to legislate
nationally concerning the public
schools of the several states?*
Our club is to debate the question
soon. R. L. BOWMAN.

On Qualified Franchise.
Editors Weekly. Jeffersonian:
I find in a northern newspaper an
editorial on the negro suffrage ques
tion that says the only reason the peo
ple of the north object to our laws
in southern states that disfranchise
so many negroes is that we don’t
make the laws impartial. That edi
tor says if we wodld only disfran
chise white men just as we do the
negroes—for exactly the same reasons
—aud be fair and honest In enforcing
the disqualifications against both
colors, then nobody on earth could, or
would, find cause to criticise our laws.
That sounds good and, in the long
run, that’s what will happen in all our
southern states, except as to our old
Confederate and Federal and other
soldiers, who had no chance to get an
education. We have the right to ex
empt* them without violating any prin
ciple of law or equity as regards the
masses.
We farmers, especially, know the
great need of having a safely and just
ly qualified franchise. We have suf
fered too long and too much from vot
ers, both in town and country, who
could be bought by our enemies with
money and whisky.
A pure and free ballot, and a fair
count, is the surest salvation of our
interests In the future.
Yours for the rule of Intelligence
and equity. WILLIAM MALONE.

THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
Our Greater Production.
Editors Weekly Jeffersonian:
I was surprised to read a statement
that the south since 1880 has changed
from agricultural to the manufactur
ing column of industries. It was said
that in 1880 the product of southern
fields was $300,000,000 in value more
than the output of our factories, and
now the latter is annually $400,000,000
more than the values of our agricul
tural outputs. These facts suggest
another great advance we should
make to get more population in the
south to manufacture our home raw
materials and consume our field food
stuffs. Then we will live in the en
joyment of a real “southern independ
ence." But let us seek our immigrants
from American rather than Europan
sources. MARCUS L. BEARDEN.

We’d Like This, Also!
Editor Watson’s Jeffersonian:
I am a woman without a vote, but
I am training two sons with the view
to seeing them use their ballots like
patriots of the Jeffersonian mold when
they com© to their majority. I read
to them from the Weekly Jeffersonian
and the Magazine. I wish at least a
quarter of a million of the first could
be circulated every week and a million
a month of the magazine go into
American homes all over the nation.
God bless and speed your fearless
and wholesome publications.

Enjoyed the Speech,
I enjoyed reading Mr. Watson’s
speech very much. I think, if we
will just heed what Tom said, we
will get a great benefit from it.
I think that the Farmers’ Union
did a good thing when they accepted
Mr. Watson’s offer to help the union.
No, I don’t think that he wants
an office, but, if he did, I would rath
er cast my vote for Tom Watson than
any man under the sun.
I like to read the good old Union
News, and the letters from all over
the states. —James M. Miller, Young’s
Chapel, Ga., in Union News.
