le! MAKING GOOD ROADS.
in Some Valuable maud Slenlble Coaellaseom
m eseabed by VPrt. ilag.
fit One authority on the subject of road
draining claims that in prairie soil a
ut good road can be obtained for eleven
So, months in the year by simply putting
,t in a good system of tile drainage,
slightly rounding the road bed
ae and sowing grass seed so that the
he roots may aid the drainage. If the
le road surface is to perform the service
of a roof it must be protected from the
00 action of narrow wagon wheels. A
Ã½* sharp turn is always in better condi
tion than the straight portions of the
te road. A little thought shows at once
that this is due to the fact that the
front and rear wheels do not follow
each other and therefore do not form
ruts. A slight difference in the length
of the front and rear axles of wagons
with the use of wide tires would ac
complish more for roads, considering
, the expense involved, than any other
one thing. It is hard to change a cus
s tom. and probably nothing but legis
lative action can introduce a change.
This change need not prove a hardship
a to anyone, and the arguments against
n such action are comparatively unim
portaent.
o Prof. King has reached the following
r conclusions: By careful study of local
conditions determine the cost of bad
roads. Pay this cost as interest on cap
ital borrowed for making the needed
p improvement. Substitute the cash sys
Stem of paying road tax for the labor
system. Tihoroughly drain all roads
and keep the drains always open. Do
away with narrow tires and axles of
the same length. Macadamize wher
ever the trafic will warrant after ful
filling the above conditions. Keep the
road as clean as you would the roof of
a house, thus tffording no chance for
water to collect and destroy the sur- 1
face.-Farmer's Voice.

TESTING THE COWS.
A Simple Method of Determintg the Per- t
formanoe of Each.
"Test your cows," is the advice con
tin ally given by dairymen and agri
cultural papery. and, like most advice,
is heeded least by those who need it O
most. Many farmers, while admitting t
its wisdom, excuse themselves from
following it on the plea that they have
no testing apparatus, and therefore no ti
means of knowing the respective per- 1
formances of the cows.
To such I would say that no scien- C
tific apparatus is necessary. The churn si
is after all the most satisfactory kind p
of tester. All that is necessary is to
keep one cow's milk separate for a l
couple of days, all the cream being i]
carefully removed. When the cream p
has ripened it should be churned, and
the scales wvill give the product.. both n
of milk and butter. A ter each cow in v
the herd has thus been tested, a com- p
parison of results will tell which are
the most profitable cows and which do
not pay for their keep. A little of this
kind of testing would cause many a
farmer to change his opinion of the
merits of the respective memnbers of
his herd, and enable him to weed out
worthless stock. Try it. The test. is a
simple one" it is easily applied, and the
results cannot be disputed. Try it.
and you will never regret the botlher
you have had in finding out the leak in
your profits.-C. D. Hell, in N.Y. World.
To Prevent masut in W heat.
Place the seed in a barrel of water
and stir until all the grain is wet and
the smutted and imperfect grains rise
to the surface, when they should be
skimmed off. tiemove the grain after
15 to 30 minutes and place a half
bushel at a time in a vessel through cc
which water can penetrate rapidly.
A -wire basket with 12 meshes to the I
inch or gunny sacking will do. Then
immerse the seed in a barrel of water t
at a temperature of 110 to 120 de
grees. lift and immerse again, rotating d
the suck. that every grain tmay be
soaked. Then immerse the sack in an
other barrel of water at 132 degrees. pa

below 1.30 degrees or above 15. Re
peat the immersion a number of times

Spring and Summer Vare of Milk.
*Cleanliness in all dairy operations is
of first importance. 31ilk with dry
hands. Keep the atmosphere in which
the milk must stand free from bad

in the cream. If the milk is wanted o
sweet, lower the temperature as soon we
as the mailk is drawn from the cow to

Re, The following interview has just been
md given our reporter by Mr. G. A. Baker, the
the overseer at the farm of CoL Isaac A. Bugg,
the of Greenville, N. C. It will interest any
ice one who has ever had Typhoid fever. Mr.
the Baker said in part:
A I was living in Beaufort county, and on
the 2d day of October, 18 8, I was stricken
d down with typhoid fever. I had the best
lhe of physicians to attend me and on the 15th
ice day of January, 1894, I was allowed to get
he up. I was emaciated, weak and had no ap.
sw petite. I could only drag along for a short
rm distance and would be compelled to sit
,th down and rest. This continued for some
vas time and I began to give up holm of ever
getting well. I lost my position in Beau
fe- fort county and having secured one in Pitt
nK county, clerking in a store, I undertook it,
aer but was so weak I could not do the work,
us- and had to give it up. The disease settled in
is, my knees, legs and feet. I was taking first
re. one kind of medicine and then another, but
ip nothing did me any good. I was mighty
tst low spirited. I moved out to Col. Sugg's
about four or five months ago and com
t- menoed taking Dr. Williams' Pills. I took
three a day for about three months. I began
ng to regain my appetite in a week's time,
:al and then my weakness began to disappear,
ad and hope sprung up with a blessedness that
p Is beyond all telling. At the expiration of
ed the three months I was entirely cured and
could take my axe and go in the woods and
i"- do as good a day's work as any man. I was
nor troubled with dyspepsia and that has disap
Id peared. It is also a splendid tonic for weak
Do people. I say, Mr. Editor, God bless Dr.
of Williams. May he live for a longtime. I
ar- know he will go up yonder to reap his re
al- ward, for he has done a wonderful lotof
he good. Toll everybody tlat asks you aboutDr.
Wof illiams' Pink Pills for Pale People that if
they wvili core to me can certainly satisfy
them as to their merits. I always carryi
r- box of pills with me and whenever I feel
bad I take one."
We were forcibly struck with the earnest
ness of Mr. Baker and his statement may be
relied on.
I ] Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, in a
condensed form, all the elements necessary
to give new life and richness to the blood
n- and restore shattered nerves. They are an
Ã½n unfailing specific for such diseases as loco
d motor ataxia, partial paralysis, St. Vitus'
id dance, sciatica, neuralgia, rheumatism,
t. nervous headache, the after effects of la
re grippe, palpitation of the heart, pale and

suiting from vitiated humors in the hblood.

SReferring to a recent inquiry, 1 would

THE NEW YORK BILL.
A Road Law Calculated to Overcome the I
Prejudeice of Taapayer.
A good roads bill introduced in the
New York legislature is skillfully i
drawn so as to overcome in a large I
measure the prejudice of local tax
payers against road building. It pro- I
vides that the expense of road improve- c
ment be borne one-half by the state.
one-fourth by the county and one
fourth by the towns along the line of
the roads that are constructed. The
board of railway commissioners is put
in charge of the road building, a road
engineer being attached to their serv
ice. It is made the duty of the board
to hold public meetings in different
parts of the state in order to promote 1
public sentiment in favor better roads.
Roads are to be improved on petition 1
of two-thirds of the owners of land a
along which they pass, if the people in 3
the towns through which such roads
run favor the improvement. In ordel, f
to start the work the bill contains an ,t
appropriation of S62o,0.ox. J3
The system as proposed would seen
to be likely to promote road building, e
If good roads are worth having, it ii a
surely a wise expenditure of money on
the part of the state to encourage their
construction. It can well afford to as
invest a considerable sum each year tl
in this manner. Insomuch as it e7
seems the only way of getting the
movement for better roads started, the o1
New York plan to have the local tax
payer relieved from direct payments is
a highly practical one. By making
the construction of improvedl roads de
pendent on the expressed wishes of W
property owners a proper limitation is
set upon the amount of road Iuilding, fe
while at the same time it i. likely to
cause competition among different
communities to get the start of each si
other in this respect.--Good Roads. t

method that will keep butter so as to

is by freezing it. at
'Thle old mnethodr of coid storage by PI
holding it at a. temperature of :18 to 40
degrees would keep the butter from

constructed on a system whereby a Ri
