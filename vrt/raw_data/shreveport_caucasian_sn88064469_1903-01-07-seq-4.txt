FOUR LIVFS ARE LOST
Lady and Her Two Young Daughters
Were Burned or Suffocated and
Miss Ethel Saunders Dies
as Result of Jump.
Chicago, Jan. 7.-Four persons lost
their lives and as many persons were
injured in a fire at the Hotel Somerset,
an eight-story brick structure at Wa
bash avenue and Twelfth street, early
Tuesday.
Three victims, Mrs. E. T. Perry,
aged 35, and her two daughters, eight
and nine years respectively, were
burned or suffocated to death in their
room on the fourth floor. The fourth
victim, Miss Ethel Saunders, 2535 In
diana avenue, jumped from the window
of a room on the same floor to the
street and died on her way to the hos
pital. The injured are: T. W. Parker.
internally; Emile Sancaz, cut by
broken glass; C. A. Wrlghtman, badly
cut about the face and hands; William
Pears, elevator boy, affected by smoke
and cut by flying glass. Mr. Parker
jumped from the window of a room on
the fourth floor to the roof of a two
story building adjoining the hotel. He
sustained a broken ankle and severe
bruises.
William Clemmons, a porter, was ar
rested. The police explained from
what could be learned from the panic
stricken guests that the fire originated
mysteriously. Clemmons was awake,
it is alleged, at the time, and the po
lice will hold him until the fire is in
vestigated.
There were about one hundred
guests in the hotel at the time. From
admissions made by Clemmons, it is
believed he caused the fire by acciden
tally igniting his bedclothes while
smoking a cigarette.
It is thought Mrs.. Perry first became
aware of th' fire and aroused her
daughters. The latter, however, ap
~ared ;to thave been quickly overcome,
th0 having been found on their beds,
hile the body of Mrs Perry lay on
e floeor near a window.

CITY COUNCIL.
The Screen Ordinance and the
Sunday Law.
At the next session of the co:nc:. to
be held Monday, January to. the ordi
nance pending and designated screen or
anti-screen ordinance mnay be called for
consideration. This ordinance is agi
tatnig the class of men who will he di
rectly affected should it become law.
This ordinance was suggested to meet
the persistent and deliberate deter:nina
tion of some saloon men to evade the
Sunday law. which they regard as beinlg
unjust. oppressive and, tyrannical. at
least to them. Since its introduction into
the council, its opponents have been
active and may have been encouraged by
men who would rejoice in the discom
fiture. of Mayor Querbes.
It may be recalled that when Mayor
Querbes was inaugurated he announced
that he would he governed by his oath
of office in the enforcement of law. His
attitude, -preceding his election, was not
disgu:ted and in the contest which re
suilted in his election he received no
favor at the hands of those who would
now discredit him in a spirit political.
In a political sense some men consider
all means legitimate to balk, weaken,
neutralize and break down an adver
sary. To the Caucasian's view there is
much silent politics in the Sunday law
agitation, which was sprung recently in
an editorial from a quarter which
aroused suspicion and startled the law
abiding community. When men of all
classes and cotditiions rebelled at the
bare mention o~:ia* Tepeal of the Sun
day law there was a- significant au
notincement on the question. The Cau
casian declares emphatically and chal
lenges all contradictions to the state
ment that the greatest majority of the
people of Shreveport are in favor of the
Sunday law, and the bartenders and
glas''s washers and attendants in saloons
are equally in favor of their Sunday as
a day of rest and recreation. And it is
declared that if the question of main
taining or repealing-the Sunday law be
left to the people, the sinners would be
joined- by the saints and the propolsed
repeal would be buried in overwhelming'
defeat.
The question or issue is plain and is
understood by men who are not easily
sw~Cjed.
M: Mn who reason have reached the
conclusion that the council would be
guilty of the rankest stupidity .if they
repealed the Sunday law. Fortunately,
F the council is not composed of stupid
i men, but there are in the council men
who may permit their kindly feeling to
becloud their judgment. Such is human
e nature. The Sunday ordinance is safe;
its-repeal would not nullify or obliter
ate the State law, and being in full
force and effect, MayOr Querbes, in
keeping with his oath of office, would
be bound to assist the State with the
police in .the enforceinent of the law.
Thet epeai of thie Suntmday law would be
a pnt.gaiined by the law-breakers, 'but
ity would sustain the loss of reve
am. which is irow. btained from the oc
casional convictiot of -the Sunday law
Sbreakers. But it is eot so match the

sentiment about it. But whatever he the
fate of this ordinanc-e. let no man vaunt
its defeat as a black eve to Mayvor
Querhes: nor let it he a couse for re
joicing ohn the part of the law-breakers.
The sentiment in favor of the enforce
ment of the Sunday law is becoming
intense and its contfitkued defiance wily
:nlyv lead to the most radical measures
for its enforcement. Mayor Querbcs and
the police. supported by the peopi , and
th< saints and sinners v. o favor their
Sunday as a day of rest, will exert
greater vigilance and energy in reaching
the law-breakers. When the great ma
jority speak in thunder tones, there will
be no mistaking where they stand. The
people will stand by Mayor Querbes
and the law regardless of any effort to
discredithim as mayor or to cast po
litical ckdium on him, in a political
sense, or in a partisan factional spirit.
Who of the classes specified in the
ordinance are the complainants and
objectors to this proposed ordinance?
The ordinances of the city are enacted
by the council to be executed by the
mayor, and if the council should fail,
neglect or withhold their power and in
fluence in strengthening the official
hands of the mayor towards the en
forcement of law. the council and not
the mayor muist be held responsible.

The C'aucasian is pleased to note that
the Shrevp irt Daily Morning Times is
in ftai,,or of the Sunday law. All doubt
ua to it, ,tand was clared by the edit
rial in ists iuc-the Sundal:y Morning
Times of Januartly 4. 10p3. Indeed. there
.hounl have been no doubt. especially
wlhen it is recalled that the Shreveport
"Mornin.g Daiy Time, was persistent in
its ad,,.c;.cy f law and order. and the
nf:,rcenn lt tf the .5nindlayl law when
Mr. I.ak wa. chief ,f police and Mr.

ilimie lhas 1n1t .ince then heen si ag
'ric>,ie nr peristenlt .i tile vigorous
liiforcemenit of the Sunday law, and
Itherefore, it may bie said in all candor
that it, recent silence, contrasted, in a
retro,..-etive. slse. seemed peculiar, at
a1, t ti.o te people who had anticipat
ed its eTcoragementl of Mayor Querbes
:std of Chief of Police Jones, who have
been -Iriving to enforce the vaws. in the
spirit and to the letter, as was then sug
:tested and advocated by the Times:
bult we beg pardion,. w\e hiave digressed
,somenx hat and as this reticence may be
in line of policy it would he indelicate
to pursue it further, and we drop it
right lere. We started by saying that
the Caucasiin is pleased to greet the
Times as a champion of the Sunday law
and congratulate all the advocates of
this law on having so strong an ally as
the Shreve .rt Time s. No doubt the
Journlal is on the samte line with the
Cauicasian-well, the Caucasian never
straddles or evades an issue, and the
people always know where to find it and
how it stands. It is never on the fence.
