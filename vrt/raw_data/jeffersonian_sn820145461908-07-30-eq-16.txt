■ cut price of 35c a year. •'You probably already know the merits of American Poultry Journal, as ■
■ It is known everywhere, being the oldest poultry paper in the United States and having the larg- ■
est circulation, 60,000 monthly. We spare no expense to make American Poultry Journal the
best. IFor two years we have been preparing this magnificent work, and it has cost us nearly ■
$5,000.00. Never before in the history of the poultry business have all recognized varieties of ■
B poultry, turkeys, ducks and geese been pictured in colors and assembled in one harmonious ■
B series of illustrations. Poultrymen have wanted and demanded these for years, but no other ■
B Poultry Journal has dared to undertake it; not even the American Poultry Association, although ■
B the demand from poultrymen for colored pictures is so strong that it is now talked that the
B American Poultry Association will have colored pictures of fowls tn the Standard some time in
B the future. •fSend in your subscription today and start with the February number, so that you ■
will secure the complete set of these beautiful colored pictures. Address all orders to B
