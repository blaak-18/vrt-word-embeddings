iTh'lis crieis in our Republic is ,
uipon us. There is a lpower in the i
United States to-day th it claims to f
h I, stronger than the gov\ernment l l
itself. C
I It has been ablle to create parnics
at will to compenl legislation to still
further strengthen its hold and add
to its rower over the destinies of

Under this stupen lour burden t
farm products are shrinking year

are made desolate, hope is vanish- t

ic where once joy and contentment

The decay of agriculture has
brought stagnation and in many
cases ruin to all other legitimate
interests.

If the reform forces which will i
meet at bt. Louis on the 22nd prox., I
.t. will lay aside all minor differences, t
individual leadership, and have but c
one purpose, one thought, one mo
tive, to unite the 95 per cent of the I
es indtwtrial forces against the con- I
a- spiracy of the 5 per cent to destroy
ut the republic, posterity will cele- I
e. brate the 22nd of July with great
to er'demonstrations of joy than we
5' celebrate the 4th of July, 1776, as
the birth day of the Republic.
It is the opinion of the writer
1 that our congressional conventions
to nominate candidates for Con
greses should not be held until af

next sixty days may entirely change

and a man of unimpeachabile integ
rity in the White Ilous". The
whole enor':o'"is Republican silver
vote will go either to Teller or Sib
ley, if n emnated. (ongressman
- Skinner, of North Carolina, says
e that the Populists will gladly sup
t port Teller or Sibley. J. M. l)e
l vine, of Nebraska, who made a
S.gaillant and nearly successful race
n for Congress on the Populist ticket
0 in 1894, says the same thing, as
does J. II. Turner, secretary of
D the national xecutive committee
r of the People's party.
' If the silver Democrats will rise
'- to the occasion, take the initiative
IC and nominate either Teller or Sib
t eIy. Th, silver Republicans and
t Populists will help to elect the can
didate. This condition of atffairs
has aroused consternation in the
Y conspirators' camp and has caused
C them to change their plans, Gro
ver Cleveland has issued a manifes
ce to calling upon his cuckoos to fight
1- for control of the Chicago conven
II tion. Whitney has abandoned his
- trip to Eur.ipe, andt be at Chicago
with his standard oil barrel. Brice

In the face of these tigtIre-,--and I

ough ex unination-1 cannot for
my life see holw the silver men in
the Dlemocratic party. who will un
doubtedly control thie ('Cicago con- I
vention, can fail to give us TellerI
or Sibley as the silver candidate, i
for without the support of the !
Populists and silver Republicans
in a tlhree cornered! contest, the I
D)emocrats would loe Alalautma,
iGeorgia, North Carolina, Texa-,
and Virginia, and its name would
become but a memnrv, at t:le that
is tthld.
From visitors to Washintotn, I
learn that Western New York is
ablaze for silver and reform. The
operatives of New Enhland are be
ginning, to see the light. Mary
land is aroused. The toilers of
Massachusetts are armning for the
fray. Even the Old 1)onminion is
ripe for a revolt. The die is cast.
The battle is cn. War is afoot.
Truth, crushed to earth by conspi
rators and venal and traitorous I
public servants, is rising again.
Let every man with a spark of in- 1
dependence take heart and do his
utmost for his land and home.
We have got the rascals on the run,
and it is our own fault if we (1do
not draw their fangs next Novem
her, and restore a government of
the people, hy the people, and for
the people. BRAIsTI : WEST.

Seeing your advertisement and be

til- try your medicine. My wife was also
a great sufferer from heart failure and
asthm . We have tested the medi
cine thoroughly, and consider the re*
sults wonderful. Kidney trouble near
ly all gone; rheumatism better than it
-a bhas een for twenty years. My wife's
dropsy all gone, kidney trouble very
much bet ter, heart trouble almost gone,
Ito- asthma better. Taking everything
into consideration--her age, which is

afflicted-it is surprising to note the
Sbenefit she has received from the use
