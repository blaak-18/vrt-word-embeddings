.EVIDENCE AGAINST 11M WM
DIRECT AND POSITIVE.
He Is Senteiced to One Year's Impri
sonmnent in the Parish Jail-Failed
to. Confuse Officer Hull.
The wire cutter. J. Huckles. had a tria
hefore Hon. A. D. Land, .judge of the
district court. yesterday afternoon. The
charge under the law is trespass, foi
which he was tried. His offense was cut
ting guy wires of the Cumberland Tele.
phone Company's pole at the intersectior
of Common, Sprague and Texas streets
on the night, February 13. The eivdence
against him was positive and conclusive
Offieer Hull recognized and identifies
him beyxond a doubt as the man who cut
the wires. Huckles attemp:ed to escape
and ran in the direction of the hall, and
then Sprague street. but was headed off
when he turned and ran down Texas
street with the officer in close pursuit.
While being pursued IIuckly threxx
away his clippers which were afterwards
recovered by Officers Hull and Roscoe
The best efforts of the defendant's attor
neys failed to move Officer Hull in his
testimony, and they also failed in an at
ter pt to weaken his evidence by one ol
their witnesses who was contradicted.
Phis effort to disprove Offcer Hull was
a dismal failure. Subjected to a most
rigid cross examination, Officer Hull
never faltered and his statements were
most forceful because they were true and
could not. be contradicted.
Defendant's counsel then called Huck
les to testify. He related that he with
others were at the Labor Union hall on
the night of. the wire cutting with men
who would prove his . innocence. In this
they failed. He denied most solemnly
l.aving.c ut the wire and alleged that
some other man who had escaped while
he fell the innocent victim to the watch
fhness and the activity of a fearless and
loyal officer. He. admitted he was..Uniot
man, of the Electrical Workers. and had
scenssed and, taken an active part in the
seike and 'been on a comnwlittee of griev
a ce. "e insisted that he was not the
man who had cut the wire.

The adcompanying letter, written by
Mr. Page M. Baker, editor of the New
Orleans Times-Democrat, is in the in
terest of the reunion of the Veterans
of the Confederacy. The letter is con
spicuously patriotic and is published by
request .of Colonel J. A. Harral, U. C.
V., aide-de-camp on General Gordan's
staff and chairman of the press com
mittee. The welcome which New Or
leans will accord to the old Corn-feds
may be anticipated. Indeed, it may he
said that no city in the South can en
tertain so well as New Orleans. espe
cially when the guests are Veterans of
the glorious Lost Cause-New Orleans
should be declared and fixed as the
place at which all reunion; of Confed
erate Veterans shall be held hereafter.
Why not ? The letter follows:
Indications are plentiful that the re
union to be held in New Orleans May
19, 20, 21 and 22, by the Uaitted Con
federate Veterans will be the most
worthily memorable event in the history
of the organization.
It is 'now more than twoscore years
since the people of the South, animated
with a spirit than which there is noth
i"g finer in human history, united as
one man in the effort to resist the in
vasion made by the Northern States,
to defend the traditional principle of
local self-government and to maintain,
in unimpaired vigor, the idea of state's
sovereignty. Without in any sense seek
ing to stir the treacherous ashes of that
-period of the national life, it is sufficient
to state that the Southern people were
then, as they have always been, actuat
ed by motives of disinterested patriot
ism. Responding promptly to the call to
arms, the old, the middle-aged and the
goung, "flocked gaily to the fight," and
for four years of fiercest war demon
strated that they were willing to die for
an idea: Discriminating critics of his
tory now recognize that the Confeder
ate soldier fought only for what all
freedom should be willing to fight. It
is now clear to all that the spirit of "he
that loseth his life dall save it"-the
spirit of "greater love hath no man than
this,- that he lay down his life for his
friend"-gave impulse and character to
the Confegderacy from the moment
,when Mr. Davis was inaugurated at
Montgomery to the hour when General
Lee surrendered at Appomattox.
It is right that the * people of the
South, of the Union and of the world,
know this. There was a time when
Americans of the Northern States
failed to comprehend the real signifi
cance of the Confederacy; a time when
they failed to appreciate the controlling
motive -of the Co federate soldier; a
time when the- linering animosities of
war blurred the historical perspective
and made it diffieulb, if not impossible,
for Federal- and' Conifederate to appraise
accrately one another's character. That
time is n6ow happily passing, if, indeed,
it has not already passed. When Lee
surrendered at Appomattox a great
issue was decided. For four years Fed
eral and 'Confederate had struggled in
civil war. Each side had spoken its
mind from the cannon's mouth. The de
clanmation .was vociferous, the rhetoric
magnificent, the argument conclusive.
And when the foot-sore Confederate
soldier surrendered his gun, wrung the
hands of his comrades in silence, and
buttoning his parole in his faded gray
packet, as Grady has pictured him, be
gan the slow and painful homeward
journey, he realized that the war 'was
over, that slavery was abolished, and
Ithat,,. henceforth, the right to secede
trout the Union could have no place in
the American polity.
This, however, was not the complete
.ignificance of Appomattox. The. sur
render of Lee's army, the parole of the
Confederate soldier, meant more than
the emancipation of a race, more than
the political welding together of sep
arate and individual States. .It ' meant
that with the echo of the last gun should
die every ignoble prejudice and mem
ory; that beneath the repedding feat
ures of war should be discerned the
redeeming nobleness of both Federal
and' Confederate; that a reciprocal con
fidence Jhould solidify and purify our
political life; and, finally, that, as one
nation, we should become one people.
It is not too much to say that this
larger significance of the titanic strug
gle of forty years ago is now - under
stood and appreciated throughout the
Union. Recently, and especially within
the,4ast few, years, the feeling has be
come strdng among thinking men every
where that in "the irrepressible con
flict" both Northerners and Southern
ers "defended the right as God gave

them to see the right," and that it was
in the inscrutable wisdom of Provi
dence that the pure purposes of the
South were crossed and her brave.
armies were overwhelmed.
It is with these feelings, and feelines
kindred to these, that Americans of the
South are looking forward to the next
annual reunion of Confederate Veter
ans. The local committee is actively at
1 work. Ample preparations are making
to receiv the hosts of ex-Confederates
that will soon converge upon New Or
leans from every section of the Union.
The people of this city hope and ex
pect that the grim men in gray who
forty years ago imperiled all for their
country--and :egretted not that they
imperiled it-will come, in large num
her, to this ho tnitable ,ld city of otr<
and receive here the welcome and len
ediction of their grateful countrymen.
The date set for the reunion draws
near. We want the venerable and en
erated heroes-the thin gray line that
is growing thinner every year-to move
with martial trend once more through
the streets of the metropolis of the
South. From Louisiana and her neigh
boring States of Mississippi, Alabama.
Texas and Arkansas; from far away
Tennessee and Florida; from farther
away Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia,
Kentucky and Maryl-"d nd from the
more distant Nor,. jnl Eastern
States in which Southern, have, since
the war, found congenial homes and
won enduring reputation--from every
point in the Union, we desire that ex
Confederates and the sons and daugh
ters of ex-Confederates shall come to
New Orleans.
In the impressive procession will he
men who represent the splendid sol
diery of the South that was ready at the
call of, duty--and is ready still-to fight
valiantly and to die without a mutr
mur. Men %ho fought not for fame, not
for empire, not (thank God) for money.
but for friends and kinsmen, for home
and country! In reflecting upon what
the Confederate soldier was, as xieli as
upon what he did, the people of New
Orleans have highly resolved that the I
reunion this year shall be the most in
teresting, the most impressive and the
most successful of all that hive been
held by the heroes in gray. The organi
za ion of United Confederate Veterans
has, it is true, reached, if it has not
passed. its zenith. Its meridian splendor
-the force and the fire that once in- r
hered to it-has waned with the quick
going years. Against it the fierce gales
of necessity, and the fiercer gales of
time itself,-have blown pitilessly. Num
erically, its power is necessarily fast c
diminishing; morally, its energy for
good is strengthening every hour. The c
memories awakened by it and the pride
stirred by a sight of the Confederate
veterans as they- pais in annual review £
on the occasion of these reunions-are
they hearts of the Southern people. We
'need not recount all the names on the
sacred list, nor tell the sad, brave story
over in all its desolate grandeur of ideal
and starving suffering; but the picture,
sketched or finished, is now and always
will be mirrored in the eyes of every
beholder. If it is only for a moment the
people of the South will, on these occa
sions of Confederate reuinions, lift the
nobly pathetic picture and reverently
uncover before it; for spite the effacing
influence bf time, it may never- be for
gotten that what William of Orange's
followers were to Holland, what the
men who fought with Bruce and Wal
lace were to Scotland, what Marathon's
"ten thousand" were to Greece, what,
indeed, Thermopylae's "three hundred"
were to Sparta, the Confederate sol
diers were, are, and will be-always
to Americans of the Southern States.
It is to ,the Confederate soldier-to
his high example in courage, in forti
tude, in patience and in the capacity to
suffer and to be still-that the younger
generation of the South owes whatever
is worthy in its civilization. This debt
may never be paid, certainly not within
the life-time of the Confederate soldier;
but the heroic sacrifice and the inspirit
ing example can live again in our re
membrance and in the remembrance of
our children. The reunion to be held
in May will remind us of the high civic
responsibility that is ours and will
prompt us to a wider and a wiser pa
tr ..tism. It will teach us that the lamp
of idealism should be kept forever
glowing, and it will lelp the world to
understand that the spirit of the Con
federate soldier, like the breath of the
Holy man, died not with the prophet
but survived him.
