WHY DIDN’T ROCKEFELLER PAY
THAT FINE?
Dear Sir: —I am handing you five
red stamps, the advertised price of
“A Chapter on Socialism”, that you
will kindly mail to the undersigned
and oblige.
Also, will you kindly answer the
following question in The Jeff as
soon as you find space:
Why did Jno. D. Rockefeller never
pay the twenty-nine million-dollar
fine imposed by the courts?
Thanking you in advance for this
information, and bidding you God
speed with the “Jeffs,”
I am yours very truly,
Atlanta, Ga. T. E. POTHILL.
Answer.
Mr. John D. Rockefeller did not
pay the $29,000,000 fine, for the sim
ple reason that he had the utmost
confidence in the Federal Courts. He
was certain that Judge Peter Gros
cup, to whom the case was appealed,
would do what the corporations se
lected him to do.
A more infamous scoundrel does
not breathe than Peter S. Groscup,
and he promptly mutilated the rec
ords, falsified the facts of the case,
and set aside the fine which Rocke
feller, naturally, felt disinclined to
pay. T. E. W.
DOCTOR OPPOSED TO COMPUL
SORY VACCINATION.
Dear Sir:—Being on a visit to my
old friend, Dr. H. Hitchman, he
showed me your issues of April 7th
and April 14th. I desire to add my
approval' to everything stated by Dr.
Hitchcock in those letters; but I
wish to “see Dr. Hitchcocks hand,
and go ten better.”
Dr. Hitchcock states in the letter
of the issue of April 14th, page 10,
s. c: “Once let the compulsory laws
be abrogated—and vaccination will
fall into desuitude —in ten years
there will be no vaccination and no
smallpox.”
Let the people pass a law making
every person who shall perform the
operation of vaccination personally
answerable to the patient, and his
heirs, for all damages which may re
sult therefrom in the future, and
within THIRTY DAYS THEREOF
there will not be a single person
who will perform the operation in
the State whose people shall have
had the wisdom to pass such a law.
1 have the honor to be sir,
Yours respectfully,

LAYING THE FOUNDATION OF
SOCIAL EQUALITY.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l must write
you and congratulate you on your
publication in Sunday’s Herald,
March 13.
How dear to my heart is the mem
ory of those great and good men you
refer to, Mercer, Stephens, Jefferson,
etc., and how true are your words in
the latter phrases of your letter con
cerning the future of the South. It
is indeed facing a great calamity. Oh,
if all the leaders and lawmakers of
our Government could be made to
see where we are drifting! But, no,
they are spending all the wealth the
South can produce to educate the
Blacks and the Chinamen, and build
hotels for the Northerners to come
down and spend the winters with
them and help donate to the needs
of the poor “negro.” I tell you, Mr.
Watson, it is ridiculous to see the
white children that are being brought
up with negroes. It may have been
all right to have “black” mammies
in slavery times; but, I tell you, it
will not do now.
•lust look at the white negroes;
why right here where I live there
are whole families of negro children
with white skins. It is simply awful
to think of. The young men that
will come after us a few years hence
will be marrying these white negroes
if we don’t mind, for, strange to say,
the majority of white negroes are
female. I tell you it makes my blood
boil when I see so many little white
children who are allowed by their
careless parents to play and mingle
with the negroes as they do. I glory
in your efforts to hold up to the pub
lic their errors. A READER.
HOW THE ROOSEVELT-POPE AF
FAIR APPEARS TO THIS
GEORGIAN.
Mr. Editor:—We see that all Chris
tendom has lately had sympathetic
convulsions because the Pope of all
the dagoes and Spaniards on the
earth snubbed Col. Roosevelt. The
Pope. did nothing more than he
should have. To one who stops to
read between the lines, the sicken
ing episode is quite nauseating. It
is to be hoped that the Protestant
world, including President Taft, ex-
Vice-President Fairbanks, the Col
onel, and all American citizens, at
heme and abroad, may learn again
the lesson that seems to have been
forgotten, viz.: that the Pope of
Rome poses as the living representa
tive of Jesus Christ on earth, and
head of the only authorized church,
and all others are heretics, sealed,
damned and delivered, and that he
and the priest only can give absolu
tion from sin, that no man, be he
king or slave, President or ex-Presi
dent, shall offer worship or honors
to this “holy father” by halves. Ro
manism does not allow her dupes,
whether in Rome or abroad, to ac
knowledge or be identified with any
religion save her own. Romanism
would teach all America, through
such men as Col. Roosevelt, that she
must and will have, sooner or later,
our undivided loyalty and toleration.
Who is so consumately blind to the
situation that he cannot see the drift
of this great machine called Catholi
cism? What means the banqueting
of our President and high officers of
State with cardinal and bishops, the
Pope’s representatives in America?
What did ex-President Roosevelt
mean by cabling Pope Pius asking
permission of an audience with his
“holiness” on arrival at Rome? And
why did ex-Vice-President Fairbanks
have such a hankering to receive his
blessings and kiss the ground on
which he walked? But he, too, got
“cold mustard,” and good for them
both. Should not the Proestant
world have a vomiting spell and dis
gorge all men who would sell them
selves and their unborn children into
the hands of the Harlot Mother who
has shed rivers of Protestant blood
and burned more Christian men and
women than all the pagans and cani
bals ever did since the dawn of crea
tion? If no Almighty hand stays
this onslaught of Romanism in
America, the very scenes enacted
during the European Inquisition will
be repeated in our fair “Land of the
Free.” H. S.

A NORTHERN MAN WHO WISHES
TO SEE JUSTICE DONE TO
THE SOUTH.
Deal’ Sir: —Enclosed find express
order for The Jeffersonian for one
year’s subscription for J. A. Robbin
son, Oklahoma Ciy, Oklahoma. Mr.
Robbinson liked your article on
“Taft and Papa’s Hierarchy”, also
the one on “Collier’s Weekly”. The
writer has “called” many a “nigger
loving” Republican for just such in
sinuations as were made by Collier’s.
We need just such men as Mr.
Watson and Mr. Vardeman in our
United States Senate. I hope to see
them both there, where they can do
the South justice. lam a Northern

the dear old Southland.
Keep up your good work.

RELIGIOUS FANATICISM RUINING
AMERICA.
Aly Dear Friend and Brother:
Just finished reading your piece in
this morning’s Constitution, and
come to congratulate you. Ellis and
Broughton make me sick. Wonder
what they will say now.
I thank God for such a man as you
are. One who stands for the right.
I see the situation practically as
you do. Dark future for our chil
dren. Negroism, Romanism, and
frustism, and professed religious
fanaticism, is ruining our country.
God’s richest blessings rest upon
and abide with you, is my prayer.
