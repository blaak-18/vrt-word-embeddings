Ayer's
HairVigor
Hor restoring to Gray Hair its
natural Vitality and Color.
A dressing
which is at
once agreea
ble, healthy,
and effectual
for preserv
ing the hair.
It soon re
stores faded
or grafy hair
to its original
color, with the gtoss and freshness of
youth. Thin hair is thickened, faill
ing hair checked, and baldness often,
though not always, cured by its
use. 'Nothing can restore the hair
where the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed:;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimiulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the 3air with a pasty sediment, it
wil: seep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gr.y or falling oft,
and consequently-prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruff, which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
Free from those deleterious sub
stances which make some prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
not harm it. If wanted merely for
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing else
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.

their timely use; and every family should
have 'them on hand for their protection and
relief, when required. Long experience has
proved them to be the safest, surest, and
best of all the Pills with which the market
abounds. By their occasional use, the blood
is Iuriiled, the corruptions of the system ex
pelled, obstructions removed, and the whole
machinery of life restored to its healthy activ.
ity. Internal organs whichhbecome clogged
and sluggish are cleansed by Alter's Pitlls,
and stimulated into action. Thus incipient
disease is changed into health, the value of
which change, when reckoned on the vast
multitudes who enjoy it, can hardly be com
pited. Their sugarcoatsag makes them
pleasant to take, and preserves their virtues
unimpaired for any length of time, so that
they are ever fresh, and perfectly reliable.
Although searching, they are mild, and oper
