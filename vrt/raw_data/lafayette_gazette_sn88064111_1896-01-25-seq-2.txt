DEAR SIR:-As various rumors are being
circulated in my ward especially and in the
parish generally concerning the course of
our representative, Hon. Julian Mouton, in
the House of Representatives at its last ses
sion in I894 on the Suffrage question, I de
sired' -have"from you as a member of the
Hou a statement of the position taken by
Ir. b outos on the subject of the Suffrage
amendment as a member of the House. A
reply from you will be of interest, and ap
preciated by myself and many other citizens
of our parish. Respectfully yours,

DEAR SIR:-Replying to yours dated Jan.
9th for information from me as a member of
the House of Representatives concerning the
course pursued by Mr. Julian Mouton, rep
resentative from your parish, on the Suffrage
question at thl last session of the Legisla
ture in 1894, will give the following state
ment showing the position taken by Mr.
Mouton on the subject of the Suffrage at
said session: Hon. A. Bcnoit, represcnta
tlve from the parish of Ouichita, and the
leader of the Populists on the floor of the
House, introduced a bill in the Legislature
: in which it was carefully provided that no
nssistance should oe given the voter by any
oh& in the preparatioi of his ballot. Under
the provisionso£ that bill, if it had passed,
no man could have voted for the candidates
of his choice unless he had known how to
read and write. The Benoit bill had most of
the features which are commonly known as
Sthe Australian Ballot System. The bill was
zIe fje£ by the House to the judiciary comn
-.41e, omposed of memnbers among whom
ere Mr. Julian1outton and myself. When
Ihe sli came up before the committee for
tion only eight menmbers and the chairman
qae um5t; Mr. Benoit, who was also a
 besdri'isented his viers for a favorable
gssrt~uiAi~s bill, and the first one to rise in
r i Ct ommittee and to take issue with Mr.
B.eojiwt was your representative, Mr. Mouton,
tetiosed among other things that he would

I* n beore the committtee, to kill that

WHERE WE STAND.
YOUNGSVyLLE, La., Jan. 22, I896.
To the Editor of the LafayetteyGazette:
Ma. EDITroR:-In your last issue, com
menting editorially upon the alleged mis
statements of certain writers about the pro
posed constitutional amendment, you say you
offer the following explanation: "It is to
the people that this question belongs and The
Gazette will try to state the matter clearly to
its readers without either taking one side or
Mie other."
As a citizen of the parish of Lafayette and
one of your subscribers, I would be pleased
to learn from you what stand you propose
taking in reference to this proposed amend
ment?
As a staunch and life-time Democrat and
an ardent advocate of party fealty, you can
take but one stand, it seems to me, and that is
to support with all your strength the action
of the Democratic convention held last De
cember at Shreveport.
That convention, as you must be fully
aware, pronounced in favor of the Suffrage
amendment. Respectfully,
BENJ. F. FLANDERS.
The editorial mentioned above
was not intended to convince any
one, but only to make what -we
thought to be a clear explanation of
the suffrage amendment.
In answer we will say that Mr.
Flanders is evidently not acquainted
with the history of the Democratic
party in this State when he says
"that as a staunch and life-long
Democrat and ardent advocate of
party fealty" the editor of this pa
per can take but one stand
to - support the amendment.
It is for that very- reason
we oppose it. It should be re
membered that the first Democratic
governor elected in this State, Gov.
Alex Mouton, a native of this par
ish, was elected on the platform of
universal suffrage, the Whigs, the
political ancestors of the Republi
can party of to-day, favoring the
then existing property qualification.
It was under that Democratic ad
ministration that the Constitutional
convention of 1845 was called and
held and by which universal suf
frage was for the first time embodied
in - our organic law. And all
this in the name of the Democratic
party.
From our view this is a matter of
conscience. Being one of those
who believe that principle should
never' be abandoned for expedien
cy or compromise, we are unalter
ably opposed to the adoption of the
amendment.
As to whether our views co-incide
or not with what Mr. Flanders con
ceives to be the duty of a Demo
crat is of no concern to us. We do
not go to Republicans to get advice
as to what we should do in order to
be a consistent Democrat.
have the people witnessed such a
disgraceful scramble for spoils as is
shown by the white Republicans and
some Populists. And the most re
freshing part of the whole business
is, zhat we are coolly informed that
all these shameful dickers and com
bination of different elements are
made to save the State from the
evil (?) influences of Democracy.
And we are told these things by
such notorious scoundrels as Kel
logg, Varmoth, Cage and Demas.
The refusal of the Virginia Legis
lature to adjourn on Gen. Robert E.
Lee's birthday was certainly rot
calculated to reflect any honor upon
that legislative body. Such action
might have passed unnoticed had
the legislature been of the carpet
bag kind, but it is absolutely in
credible when it is known that the
present legislature is composed of
Democrats, and Southern Demno
crati at that.
The Iberville South has expressed
a preference for Hon. Andrew Price
for United States Senator to succeed
Senator Blanchard. The aspirants
for. senatorial honors are Senator
Blanchard, Congressman Price and
jJudge Blackman: Ex-Senator Jo
nas has not -yet beea mentioned,
ti taw he isa standsng pagdi ate
Sagel.C« against thinegroes. ,ey
ter'- a lny the wetings; they de-:
instance, the -nationsa -- ptb icans,
no one" oould'fjihninate; .more4 sav
agely against tb't negroes. -Th ey
would allow' no colored man - to en- -1
ter any of. the--meetings; they de- I
clared that they favored the elimi
nation of the negro from ouor poli
tics and would support the suffrage
amendment; and we were informed
that at last a Republican -party had
been organized in Louisiana that I
was respectable and free from any
taint of Africanism. But, alas, 1
even the planters could not keep 1
away from this fatal issue.
As for the ]Republican party
proper, it has abandoned all issue 4
in the present campaign but the ne
gro one. It is opposed to all -the
legislation which has been passed ini
the interest of protecting white su
premacy. It demands the repeal of 1
the anti-miscegenation law and of I
the separate railroad car law, and i
it protests against the suffrage
amendment. It would send us back
a 4uarter of a century to the period I
of 187o, when the negroes were as
sailing our public school system and I
threatening its extinction. There is 1
not a prominent negro in Louisiana 1
who does not believe in mixed J
schools, who would not educate the I
white and black youth together, who
does not believe in what is so close 1
to social equality that no one can
define the difference. All these are I
the legitimate aims of the Republi- 1
can party, and would come with 1
Republican victory.
There is no getting away from it.
A party with that name drifts nat
urally to Africa. We have seen no
better evidence of it than in the I0o
sition of the bolting planters. No 1
one appreciates more than they the 4
evils of negro supremacy, no one is
naturally more opposed to it. It is I
but justice to the national Repub
licans to say that they saw the dan
ger, the probability of their being i
swamped in- the African hordes, and 1
tried to steer clear of it, shut their I
doors to the blacks, refused, save
in a few cases, to deal with them
and set up the pure. white flag of Cau-ý
casia. If they have failed, if they
have been forced by their very name
to take up the defense of negro suf
frage it is only proof that Republi
canism in Louisiana at least means
negro, or alliance with negroism.
The following paragraph was
clipped out of a very able editorial
which appeared in the St. Landry
Clarion of Jan. S:
"If men claiming to be Demo
crats, no matter what may be their I
social position or influence, are to
be permitted to wear Democracy as
a cloak, to be put on and off as self
interest or factional spirit may dic
tate, then we had better have no
party organization at all. A set of
politicians in a Democratic distr;ct
or parish who have lost their hold
upon the Democratic masses and
have to maintain themselves, if at
all, by a combination with the
enemies of the Democracy, should
for very shame cease all claim to
consideration save that accorded to
the spoilsman intent only upon cap
turing an office. Surely no one will
deny but that all Democrats shoul-l
be forced to respect ard obey legit
imate Democratic authority.
The New Orleans States expresses
the hope that at the next session of
the Louisiana Legislature a bill will
be promptly passed making the
birthday of General Lee a State
holiday. Such action will be emi
nently proper on the part of our
legislators, and we sincerely hope
that they will not be loath to recog
nize the proprietary of suspending
public business one day every year
as a token of respect for the mem
ory for the greatest of American
generals.
The great trouble with the "peo
ple's ticket" is that the people don't
want it. It's like Bill Arp's lecture
on ghosts wherin the lecturer failed
t', say anything about ghosts.
Will the Gougoos put a district
attorney on their ticket?
Some say it will be Mr. Chargois
and others believe they will support
Mr. Bourges.

zard has o sense of smell but that
he has an eye keener than that of an £

dead or: dying beast from an im- g
mense disitance. It is well that-he.
has no sense of smell; that is a wise t
J ipro ion- of a benevolent .Creator. t
I.f he buzzard could smell he would (
no longer be a scavenger, and his I
use is the economy of nature would r

buzzard, on the contrary, has both a
a keen eye- and a well-developed

lighted by the odor of the nrgger, I

feast of plunder and rascality he
flourished on from .1868 to 1878. 1
The buzzards are here now in all 3
their force, and are quite jubilant. t
They realize that they have never in I
many years before had so fine 'an op- 1
i ortunity to gorge themselves as I
they have now. No doubt .they are t
rejoicing over the prospect of negroes I
in the State House, in the country r
court-houses and in the offices of a
bonds and taxes. Even a company £
of eagles. that erstwhile were their t
most relentless enemies I-ave puts
their ornathological handkerchiefs t
to their noses and are actually flock- C
ing with them. I
But alas for the buzzards, their I
day is ended, and ended forever.
The white-winged spirit of Democ
racy and White Supremacy is in- t
vincible, and though the old-time <
carpet-bag buzzard and the old-time
scalawag cormorant be joined by
the new-time bounty grabber the I
whole flock must "git up and git." I
The white Democracy of Louisiana
is going to rule the State, and neither
buzzard, nor cormorant, nor bounty
grabber can prevail against it. -

A letter was received yesterday by
Judge Ferguson, of the criminal dis
trict court, from one of his fellow t
judges of the civil district couit, 1
and establishes a new and efficacious
method of dodging jury duty. Here t
it is: ,"My Dear Judge:-Mr. -- ,
one of my sons. has been summoned
as a juror in your court. I beg you I
will excuse him from jury duty, in- I
voking in his behalf the exemption
provided in verse 5, chapter 24 of
Deuteronomy, Donay Bible: 'When
a man hath lately taken a wife, he I
shall not go out to war, neither =
shall any public business be en
joined himn; but he shall be free at
home without fault, that for one
year he may rejoice with his wife.' z
The fieedom thus granted will not t
expire until the 19th of the coming
month, and he claims it from a just
man and a God-fearing magistrate."
The relief prayed *or was granted.

In speaking of the lady who is soon to
marry ex-President H-arrison, a New York
correspondent of the Chicago Times-I-Herald
says: "The axiom that little men incline
naturally to tall women is shattered in the
present instance. Mrs. Dimmick is petite.
She confers upon her future husband the
dignity of great stature when they walk to
gether. Sh. must look tup to him. Mrs.
Dimmick is not "'in society." She does not
shake your hand with an altitudinous twist
in greeting. She has never been more ac
cessible than since her engagement was an
nounced, but she will not be interviewed.
She is not a beautiful woman in the ordinary
- sense; She has neither unfathomable eyes,
Sfaultless features nor a ravishing complexion.
It is not the senses she takes by storm, but
the heart. Her face is fairly youthful, with
Sthe ebullience of good feeling. The eyes
r dance with enjoyment as she talks, and the
lips smile frequently and almost girlisily.
She is woman enough to raise her hand to
her hair once or twice, so that you may see
her engagement ring, and you like her the
better for it. Her eyes have prevailing
t tints of hazel, and every school girl knows
that such eyes mean steadfastness and truth.
The face is a little care-worn, but you re
I member that its owner has been tried in the
battle of life. The forehead Is low, broad
and unwrinkled, and crowned with an am
t ple coronet of soft brown hair; the nose
straight and delicate; the lips a trifle too
Sthin, perhaps, but firm and contented in ex
Spression."

gram businests the facilities forstor
iig and handling it were sneatly in
creased, but they 'are not up to the
present phenomenal. business.- One
i:ad alone, thIe Illinois 'Central, is
~ly-congested with the corn des-.
-tied for New Orleans it is handling.
Its elevators are filled, with as much
corn in them, as they can possibly
-hold. It has 900 cars loaded. with
corn, awaiting shipment and tied up
lhere because there is no place where
the grain can be stored. No less
than 75 car-loads were taken to Port
Chalmette to be exported from there,
but this failed to give the needed
relief, for the corn continues to
pour in here as rapidly as' it is ex
ported.
The Illinois Central has been re
ceiving 2oo car-loads daily, and has
sooo cars of corn destined for New
Orleans on the road between here
and Cairo. Great as the business is
now, it is expected to still further
improve, and it is predicted that the
corn exports in -March will greatly
exceed that of January.
The United States will do the
largest business with Europe this
year in the matter of the exporta
tion of corn it has ever known, and
New Orleans will probably lead the
Union. Europe has hitherto taken
but a small quantity of coin from I
us, and has never fully realized the
good qualities of the American ce
real. It is very cheap this year,
and as a consequence a great deal of
corn is being exported. This ought
to make Europe better acquainted
with corn, create a demand for it
there and assure us of a good mark
et for the largest crop this country
produces, and which in the past we
have mainly consumed at home.
New Orleans will always get its
full share of this business, as it is
the nearest port to the centre of
corn prodution.

Value of Corn.
Considerable difference of opin
ion exists among farmers as to the
number of pounds of pork that can
be made from a bushel of corn.
The estimates run all the way from
three to twelve pounds. The
amount depends upon the kind of
stock, the weather, the skill of the
feeder and other conditions.
Breeds, too, differ in this respect,
some showing somewhat greater
gains than others, but all the im
proved varieties respond more
readily than the scrub. It is imn
possible, therefore, to lay down any
regular rule by which to find the
pork equivalent to a bushel of corn.
We are able only to determine the
approximate value.
In some experiments recently
made in this direction it was found
that thoroughbred pigs requiied
nearly one thousand pounds of
meal to carry them from xo', to 300
pounds in a growing condition and
without making them too fat.
Greater gains can be made, how
ever, with pigs under r oo pounds,
the smaller the animal the less
amount of food being required to
supp ,rt its weight while making the
gain.-New York World.
The farmer who has "boarded at
home" during the year 1895 and has
his crib filled with corn and his
smokehouse full of meat is in a fair
way of sustaining himself and his
family without having to depeid or
call on somebody for supplies. It
is comfort and money for the farm
er who will stick to the live at home
policy. -Caucasian.
