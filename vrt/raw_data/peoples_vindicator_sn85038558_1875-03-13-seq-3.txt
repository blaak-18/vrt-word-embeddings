IlAD A PRESENTIMENT.-Just
as a train started out on the Great
Western Road the other day a
woman leaned forward and called
to her husband, who was teli feet
away:
"Say, Simon, did you wash your
feet andl change your socks ?"
"No, by swain !--forgot all about
it!" he replied.
"Well," she said as she leaned
back, "I feel it in my hones that
there's going to be a- smashup
afore we get to London, and if
you are killed I'll just purtend I
didn't know ye!"
COLD CotURTING.-S a t u r d a y
morning :at 2 o'clock the police
tf'ndl a horse and cutter comli:t;
in from the country on the Ponti
ac road, with the ?driver so nearly
frozen thaJt he was lopped over on
the seat and nulcoinscious,. li
was taken to the station, and
they thawed him out after an
hour or so. Whein lie could speak,
be asked:
"Sergeant, will I live'"
"Oh, yes, I guess so," was the
answer.
"Well, I'm sorry," mused the
young maln. "I wanted to die, so
that they could put on my tomb
stone: 'Hero lies one who was
fool enough to ride twenty-six
miles to spark a red'headed girl !"'
-Detroit Free Press.
Mt)es Jackson, of Indiana, remark
ed: "Pass that 'ere butter," and he
fell back and died. Butter at thirty
cents per pound is a matter not to
be trifled with.
"Gentlemen," said a street orator
in Richmond the other day, "if you
will persist in throwing eggs at nme
please perfume about one out of five,
to vary the monotony !"
A Rhode Island cow tore a woman's
mouth clear around to her ear, and
her husband at once ran away. He
said it useless to think of contending
with a woman who was all mouth.

lecture tour. Look out, Miss Cush

well as you did.--Boston News.
The Louisville small boy, it must
be admitted, is much wore tlian his
contempories in the Northern cities,
but ice freezes very thin there.

.LAIN" UNDERSTANDING.-In the of
fce of one of the hotels Saturday a
gentleman snapped his. finger to a
beot-black, and as he put his foot on
the box he said: -.
You look like a good, smart boy.",
."See here, mister !" replied the boy
as he rose up, a brush in either band,
"rve hal that game played on me a
dozen times, and now I want to know
whether this is a cash shine or wheth
er your're going to pat me on the
head when I get through and tell me
that I'll be Governor of Michigan

It is asserted as a fact that every
canvasser who bas turned his atten
tioa to the intrqdnction of the New
Family Sewing Machine in his local
ity, or Who has been fortunate enough
to secure an agency, has outstripped
the best efforts in making money of
the old and tried Agents of the high
ip"1mipeachines, which latter they
ow replrate. The demand is enor
moun, and sales so.rapid and ,,morey
'mad4 so readily with so little effort
that Farners, Tradesmen, Specnla

infamnous printing law nassed by a parti

hold, a"t the ex1peI( of the tax-payeI's,
journlls entirely antagonistical to their
hiter(st, and at war upon their liblrtihs,
and by forcing, under the forms of law,
our citizens to ,idvertise in these oflicial
papers, to break down their l,,ower, the
Conservative and Democratic press; con
jequnti}ly we iuo coniielled to depend
for slupport uponl the generolus contribn

The fntnre tone of this paper can be
juiged from ifs past. We will continue
to advocate to success, the rights of the
TAXED, that honesty and capability,

them to be antagonistic t o public good.
