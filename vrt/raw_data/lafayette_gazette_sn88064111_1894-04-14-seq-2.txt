A CONT'RAST.
In politics, there have been, there
are and there will always be too
cla.ses of men, as distttct from one
an other, as beauty is rtrdn ugliness,
as purity and virtueerp from corup
tioe and viit, as truth is from
fasehood. In one of these classes
you Bad the office-seekers and bum
mers who are commonly called poli
ticians. These men are good
humored, shrewd, selfish sorts of
tellows; they always meet you
with a smile on their lips; they
possess in the highest degree the re
markable facility to agree with every
oat and every body on every ques
eiod of general or local latesest, and
s.lty never antagonize any one on
whatever whimsical or fancied
notions he may entertain concerning
mteasures submitted to the votes of
the people, provided the voter is
disposed to turn the grinding stone
to sharpen his ax. They agree in
variably with every body provided
every body help them to paddle their
canoe down the stream, that will
land them in the comfortable harbor
of a lucrative office;-they are jolly
fellows,-they laugh apparently,
heartily, at any thing one may say,
no matter how stupid it may be;
they are polite to extreme with ladies
and very familiar with young men,
Who they address by their nick
names, as Jake and Joe; they are
proud of being called "bonsgarcoss"
by old people;-and when in their
race for office they find that the
current of public opinion is running
contrary to their ambition and that
they are threatened to be swamped
they turn a somersault and glide
smoothly down stream. And they
generally reach the goal of their
ambition.
In the other class you findlionest,
straight, out spoken men, who are
indifferent to their own individual
or personal interest or success; by
words and actions they have nothing
in view but the good and welfare of
the Commonwealth; they will not
hesitate, even at the risk of incurring
the displeasure of the voters, to
antagonize their whims or prejudices,
when in their opinion the public
weal requires it. In old times, in
the days of Jefferson, Jackson,
Webster and Clay, these men
Were not called politicians;
they were called patriots, but in our
days of so-called progress they are
called oldfoggies, with ante-deluvian
iMeas, who do not appreciate the
Mackianvellian teachings, (that to be
successful in politics, one must study
and understand the ruling passions
and prejudices of his epoch, and
steer his course accordingly and
avoid clashing with popular senti
mernt.
Sincerity in politics, is no more
an element of success, because
there are too many people, who do
not like to hear the truth, for the
'-.rson that it clashes with their in
Stereit and vanity. The consequence
Sis that these honest and out-spoken
.ninr, are not heeded and are put on
the-shelves, and the country is left
at the mercy of politicians and
bummers who revolve around the
light of selfinterest Itke bugs.around
a candle.

GRAND JURY'S REPORT.
To the rlonorable A. C. Allen, Judge,
We, the undersigned grand jurors of the
Parish of Lafayette, empanneled for this
term of your honorable court, beg leave to
submit the following report:
After careful examination of the parish
jail we find it in good condition and the
prisoners well treated and cared for.
The sheriff's office is well kept. The
sheriff has made settlements with the state
and parish for which he holds receipts in
full. We commend this officer for his zeal
in the discharge of his duties and his prompt
settlement with the government tor all
public funds entrusted to him in his official
capacity.
The public records and archives of the
clerk's office are well arranged and pre.
served, and we find everything belongirg to
this office well kept and in good condition
as becomes a faithful officer.
However, we would call the attention of
the Police Jury to the building in which the
clerk has his oflice, which we consider to
need some repairs. There are leaks in the
windowswhich should be attended to, and
a coat of paint on the outside would im
prove the appearance of the building and
contribute to its preservation.
We would also call the attention of the
honorable Police Jury to the plank sidewalk
leading to the court house and clerk's office
which is in very bad condition, and should
be immediately repaired; and to the fence
around the court house square, and would
suggest that it be taken off entirely
After actual count we find in the rarish
treasury $1,939.34 to the credit of the
school fund; $4,944.14 to the credit of the
parish, which shows an in honest and
economical administration of public
affairs that should be gratifying to the peo
ple.
To the zeal and methods of tie district
attorney the parish is largely indebted for
the rapidity with which we have investiga
ted the numerous cases brought to our knowl
edge, and we must say that we were much
assisted in the performance of our duties by
the lucid and able charge of the court.
We further call the attention of the Po
lice Jury to the general appearance of the
court house, and suggest that that body
take necessary steps to have the same
painte l.
We have taken a special interest, and
have made thorough examination of the
causes that make our public roads- an such
an impassable condition. We feel that the
people as a general rule are in favor of road
work, and do not refuse to go when called
upon to do road duty, but we find the fault
in the road overseers, who are negligent
as to their powers to force the people to
work the roads and ignorant as to the law.
We huare called the road overseers before
us, and our investigation shows beyond
question that there has been no wanton neg
lect in the performance of their duty, but
the fault lies chiefly as stated above-from
absolute ignorance of the duties incumbent
upon them.
We took this occablion to have the district
attorney explain the law to them, the law
govorning road work, etc., ind we now be
lieve that we can assure the people that in
the near future we will have much better
roads, the district attorney promising to fur
nish the road overseer with the law applica
ble to road work, and to the end that the
roads will be in safe traveling condition.
WW suggest that the Police Jury make all
the necssary appropriations for bridges, etc.
We herewith attach report of superintend
ant of public education of this parish and
make same part of our report, the difference
existing as to the balance on hand as shown
in his report and that as shown in report of
parish treasurer is explained by the fact that
the treasurer's is up to date, and the Shport
of thesuperintendent is dated April 6, 1894,
showing that there has been some disburse
ments since that time.
Having fully completel the duties
given us in the charge of y dEhonor, which
served as a guide to us in oar tedious delib
erationsa, and believing as ~ r honor does
that only a careful enforamient of the law
will secure to the people all the rights guar
anteed to them by the Constitution and laws
of the State, we respectfully submit this,
our fimaL report, sad ask to be discharged.

laUentlesranly Taxes.
Atlanta Constitution
Acdorting 'to The New York
World, the latest argument against
an income tax is that it is "not gen
tlemanly. "
Very naturally this leads to sev
eral pertinent questivncs Is it more
ungentlemanly to investignte a citi
zen's income and tax it than it is to
sekteh his baggage when he returns
from Europe? Is it any worse than
our inquisitorial internal revenue
system? Is it more objectionable
than our present fashion of taxing
a poor man on his consumtion of
food, fuel and clothing, while the
rich bondholder enjoys a big un
tiked income?
The new argument may strike a
plutocrat very favorably, but plaits
people will take no stock in it. The
fact is, all the methods of our gov
ernment are ungentlemanly. Eti
quette has no place ln the adminis
tration of our laws. Our govern
mental machine is as brutal as the
car of Juggernaut. It runs over
and crushes all who stand in its way.
The sensitive bondholder who con
siders it an insult to be asked the
amount of his income by a tax re
ceiver should remember that in
this country, from the cradle to the
grave, people are asked all sorts of
questions by our public officials.
A man cannot go through a case in
court, obtain a burial periment, se
cure a license, be admitted to the
bar, take his seat in the legislature
manufacture whisky or tobacco or
land at one of our ports without
answering, generally under oath,
some very searching questions.
It is utter nonsense to object to
the income tax on the ground that
it is inquisitorial, or as Mr. Ward
McAllister would say, ungentle
manly. The objection applies with
equal force to ll our taxes and all
the methods of our government.
It may be a gentlemanly thing to
exempt a bondholder with an income
of $ioo,ooo a year from taxation,
while his poor neigebor is taxed on
his little cottage, but it is also an
unjust and an infamous thing.
Real Estate and Matrimony.
A newly elected justice of the
peace who had been used to draw
ing up deeds and little else, was
called upon to marry a couple in
haste. Removing his hat he re
marked: "hats off in the presence
of the court.
"Hold up your right hand. You,
John Mankin, do you solemnly
swear to the best of your knowl
edge an' belief, that )er take this
woman to have an' to hold for yer
self, yer heirs, executioners, admin
istrators and assigns, for yer an'
their use forever?"
*"I do, answered the groom
promptly.
"You, Alice Evans, take this yer
man for yer husband, ter have and
ter hold forever, an' you do
solemnly swear that yer lawfully
seized in fee simple an' from all in
cumbrance, an' have good right to
sell, bargain an' convey to said
grantee, yerself, yer heirs adminis
trators, an' assigns?
"I-I do," said the bride doubt
fully.
"Well, that ere's worth a dollar
an' fifty cents."
"Are we married yet?" asked
the bride.
No, not yet. Know all men by
these presents, that I, being in good
health an' of sound mind an' dispo
sition, in consideration of a dollar
and fifty cents to me in hand, well
and truly paid, the receipt whereof
is hereby acknowledged, do, an' by
these presents have declared you
man an' wife during good behavior
an' until otherwise ordered by the
court."
