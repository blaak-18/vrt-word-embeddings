Tw*;ity froggic» xxent to school,
î)owii lieside a rusliy pool ;
/f'wtjnty lit fia coat* of green,
Twenty vests all white and clean.
" W« uiust lié in time," m : i id they ;
f First \yw study, then we play ;
Tli.'it is how we keep tlui l ulu
When we I'roggies go to school."
Master Hollfrojr, /{ravo and stern,
<'al'ert the classes ill their turn ;
Taught them how to nolily strive,
Likewise how to leap and dive ;
Fi oin Iiis seat upon the log.
Taught tliein how to say, "Jver ehog !"
Also how to dodge a blow
From the »ticks that bad bows throw.
Twenty froggiey grew up fast ;
J'ullfrogs they be*'.iliue at lr.st;
Not one dunce among the lot.
Nut one lesson they forgot ;
Polished in a high decree,
As each fl'oggic ought to Ik; ;
Now they sit on litlier loirs
Teacliirig other little frogs.
Ail Ancient Metric System.
The librniy of Asshnrbanipal. King o
Assyria, found during Mr. Enyard's exca
vations at Nineveh, shows that. Science
had made no little progress in Asia txveii
ly-tivo hundred years ago. This curious
library consisted of Hat, square tablets of
baked clay, having on each side, a page of
closely written cuneiform cursive letlcrs.
which had been impressed on theclax
while it was yet moist. The great ma
jority of these, tablets are now in the
ilritish Museum, and have been found to
contain toe remains of an immense gra
matical encyclopaedia.. There ere a! s ,,
fiabluents of many mathematical and a >
tromical treatise, with calalongo i.l oli
servations, tables, calculation!; of el lipses
cfthe moon, and observations of solar
eclipses' the earliest of which occiiitci!
nearly a thousand years before the be
ginning of the Christian era. There arc
also fragments (tf law books and 1 1 re
cords, books of chronology, niii'iu.ils of
history, accounts of Assyrian and other
iliViliijicg. Collect ions of hymns in the sty le
«if, the l'saliiins of David, a geographical
cnrylopaedia, works on natural history
«•onlaining lists of plants and animals, oi
I il über trees employed in building and!
furnishing, of "stone's tit for architecture
and sculpture, etc. Perhaps the most in
teresting of all these lists is a classified
cataloge ot every species ol animals known ;
to tile Assyrians, showing a scientific no- i
lifenelntuio similar in priucijde lo that of
l.iuuaeus. f)p]»o,site, tîn» ctinimon name ot"
each animal is placed a scientif.c and
idoej-r.iphtc nnme, composed of two par ts.
a family name and a characteristic
ephithet, denoting the species.
A still more, rciearkabie indication of
the scientific advancement, of the ancient
Assyiisns appears in their system ol
weights ank measures, in which, as in the
French system, all the units of surface,
capacity . and weight were, derived lYum
one typical linear unit. The, basis of the
system was the cubit, (equal lo -Jil-li? in
ches). This was divided into parts, cor
responding with the minutes of the decree.
The cubit,multiplied by 'MK th<! tinmber
of degrees in a circle, prod need tire stade
the unit for large distances. The fnisda• j
menial unit for areas was the square fool,
the Square of a measure, beariri" to the'
cubit the relation of:» to 5. or IC™4 inches j
of measure. The cirbo of the foot was the
luerreta, tiro standi.id of all measures ol 1
capacity : and tho weight of a cubic footi.,.,.1
water gave the talent, the fundamental j
irriit of weight : the sexagesimal division I
of the t;il<;nt gave, first, the mina ( , =.")IS K5 i

being invariably intiltiplicil or divide.', hy
sixty, the result, again hy sixty, and so on
to infinity. " This, it, is very evident-.''
observes Lenoniiant, " was tho result ol'a
wise coinliination of a very i>r:ic|ical
cliHractcr. intenileil to eonihiue the adva.n
t ages oft he two systems of dividing uni | \
that have heeii in dispute a| all limes anil
among all nations— the decimal and the
duodecimal " West'll follow tiiis Chaldaeo
Assyrian system ' in the division of the
circle and in our division of time.

Last evening one of onrcitizen«, who
lias a tum of practical joking r i it-it his
band in this line upon a well-known
lager beer dealer in North Thud street,
by leading a mule into his saloon and
taking him np to the bar as if to drink
Mynheer look steadily at the pair for a
Jew moments, as if collecting his stray
wits, ami then broke forth as follows:
"See here, 1 know vot dis is here-ynur
own brudder; but lie be one you call a
minor, he isli too mutch young to drink
his glass lager; it is not for the law in
no place, nor mit my saloon, lie look

health of tho system will follow.
