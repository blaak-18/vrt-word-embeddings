several complaints about the charges
idiposed for the inspection of weights
and measures.. We think that the
inspector should be a salaried offi
cer, relieving the merchant of a
tax that brings no benefit to ~#i5 in
any way whatever, and is intended
as a protection to others. The
sciakles and measures are the tools
with ihich the merchant carries on
his business, for which he pays a
license; nid there is about as much
justice in taxing him for the inspec
tion of those appliances, as there
would lit in applying a special tax
on every tool used by a mechanic
that are niecessary for him to work
at his tade.

We, the undersigned residents and tax

honorable body to consider, and recognize
as a suggestion for the improvement and
working of the public roads, the plan pro
proposed by Mr. J. R. Domengeaux, The

known as the "Cherokee'plan." It is,. that
the public ,roads df Lafayette parish be di
vided into five-mile tracks, every five-mile
to be contracted to one (nidividual, who
promises under o tth, to properly *ork;
grade and drain his track of road. A bond
to',be furnished:.by. each wntractor, with
forfeiture of same, it wori~ is not done in a
satisfactory manner to the ext~rets, or par
ties appointed by the -dliet Jury; to inves
tigate and pronounce work satisfactory as
contracted. The party contracting to re
ceive either a quarterly, semi-yearly or
yearly salary as th~e Police Jury may deem
proper. He mst, q lt his persona. expense,
secure the labor, etc., required to keep in
a passable and practicable condition his five

S A Big ~.MiLstake.
It is a big mt4ite that is often
asde by the public men and office
seekers to suppose thabt thq sorning
papers published fi lew Orleans re
preiseti the sentimgnts of the people,
in their columnge.lt is a big mis
take to sup ose thir the members of
the C~ton ]xchainge and the Sugar
Eichange and the Produce Ex
change, in New Olleans, .represent
the sentiments of- thb' peiopre- of
Lo.usia'm. It is a big mistake to
s4~pose that the people of New
Orleans are controllied by the edito
rela.xtsithed'foresid mo;niiig papers.
I: is a big mistake to supppse that
because the Pic and T-D pilibh
1ofhi'g .euloies of plblic uae'ii,
th tha e: ohe cl let" i .these men will
be ealorsed by the people. Two
.ye'rt ir_. these same j'eir Slhaed
their colukas with prophieeil that]
certain thiis would happen in thiis
SState. 'TIhej proved false ptophets.
1W ofiiealS wished to be happy,
thi couadd be rieadily icdinplished;
but we wulsh t"6 be" he ier than
other people; ahid this is almost
always difficult, for we believe others
*ibi ehappier thani they are.
5DUtiTCAIONALO
What is necessary to conitithtt
i£ dd .schpil system? This is i
very pertinent question,..not alone
to those places just. establishing a
school systems, but Aliso to those
which are not l for superior ed~i
cational institutions. The idea is
to tihi" the. schools to the highest
tion possible, and since the
*ptld is continually progressing,
hibchition iniethods .ah.t h4ught
must eqitallypro s; gre W i a these
is a great differeie as to ihethod#
and the subjects to lie tiaght; yet
as to what is absolutely a sar3
for building u P, itin ul efi
ci8nt si$stdil"it nay be laid do*n
as a fact, that a nine or ten months
term, capable teachers, ind local
interest are the three ei~ ttii'"l
As to the lenigth of term, whether
nine or ten months, there is some
discussion, yet in most instances
`where. there are "sff.eient ftiuids, the
schools are continued o. months.
There are two good reasonsii for this.
Childhood is the, proper, tiie and
unusually the only time for acquir
ing an education, and for that rea
CitIsf 4 umph as possible should be
learned in the eighk y1Cirs qusaually
devoted to that purpose. This en
tails no hardship on the child and
is fo i.a tis nefit, . Again, teaching
is a ofession .and successful and
capable iehr cai, nriot afford t
,mui idle thine months out of
twelve unless salaries are corres
ponding. When the terms are too
short, and the pay small, it drives
the best teachers out of the profes
sion, and proves a very serious loss
to education. As to capable teach
ers, nothing can be more necessary.
The teacher is really the school.
Upon him depends its success, and
by success is meant the power of
the school to impart insttuctioii aiid
build character. As a noted edu
cator has said, "No school can rise
uperior to its teacher."The posi
tion of instructor to the young is a
most difficult one. It requires tact;
judgment, ability and strong chair
acter. A man who can fill the po
sition wisely and capably is very
valuable, and when .such a one
is once secured by a commu
nity, they ishould by aQI meanis re
tail him. It is not so easy to re
place a good teacher.
To work in an unsympathetic at
mosphere is ddtuble rotk. . . It takes
away the support that it teachir
needs, and not only forces him to
enthuse his pupils, but even to
struggle against the conteracting
home influence. Parenat should
talk hobol and think, sc3do1, they
should take a pride in their chil
dren's woik, they should see that
their children attend regularly and
promptly,. and should instill in them
respect for and obedience
to their teachers, and they shou:ii
visit the schools now and then.
There are numbers of ways in which
pareits can manifest interest, qd
they should do so; it is for the good
of their children, and for the good
of the community.
